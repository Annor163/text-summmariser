@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this research, multistage one-shot decision making under uncertainty is studied. In such a decision problem, a decision maker has one and only one chance to make a decision at each stage with possibilistic information. Based on the one-shot decision theory, approaches to multistage one-shot decision making are proposed. In the proposed approach, a decision maker chooses one state amongst all the states according to his/her attitude about satisfaction and possibility at each stage. The payoff at each stage is associated with the focus points at the succeeding stages. Based on the selected states (focus points), the sequence of optimal decisions is determined by dynamic programming. The proposed method is a fundamental alternative for multistage decision making under uncertainty because it is scenario-based instead of lottery-based as in the other existing methods. The one-shot optimal stopping problem is analyzed where a decision maker has only one chance to determine stopping or continuing at each stage. The theoretical results have been obtained.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Decision theories under uncertainty are theories of choice under uncertainty, where the objects of choice are probability distributions for expected utility theory, subjective expected utility theory and their varieties, or prospects framed in terms of gains and losses for prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), or possibility distributions regarded as possibilistic lotteries (Dubois, Prade, & Sabbadin, 2001). However, all of these theories are lottery-based theories which generally follow the Bernoullian framework of the weighted average.One-shot (one-time) decision is typical for situations where a decision maker has one and only one chance to make a decision with partially known information. Let us begin with a real example of one-shot decision problems. The Great Sichuan Earthquake occurred at 14:28:01 CST on May 12, 2008. Official figures stated that 69,197 people were confirmed dead. Amongst many problems caused by the earthquake, Tangjiashan Lake particularly drew the attention of the world because it was seriously threatening the lives of 1,300,000 people, the Lanchengyu Oil Pipeline and the Chengbao Railway (one of the arterial railways in China). To prevent damage to the dam, the water in the lake needed to be drained away as soon as possible by building a sluice channel. There were only two alternatives for building a sluice channel: using explosives or digging by excavators. It was a one-shot decision to decide which method should be utilized in the face of the uncertainties from rain, aftershock, dam stability, land slip and time. Other examples of one-shot decision problems include the individual real estate investment (Guo, 2010b), the medical treatment choice of a person with a life-threatening illness, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and other decision-analysis projects in enterprises (Clemen & Kwit, 2001). One-shot decision problems are commonly encountered in business, economics, and social systems.Guo (2011) initially proposed the one-shot decision theory for dealing with one-shot decision problems. The one-shot decision theory provides the scenario-based choice instead of the lottery-based choices as in other decision theories under uncertainty. It is enlightened by the common phenomenon that when asking a person why he/she makes such a one-shot decision with little information, he/she will most often reply one scenario, which is crucial to him/her and the basis for achieving his/her conclusion. Let us refer to an example. An article in Mainichi Japan (June 16, 2012) reported that “Japan’s government on Saturday approved bringing the country’s first nuclear reactors back online since last year’s earthquake and tsunami led to a shutdown of reactors nationwide.” Whether to restart nuclear reactors in western Japan was a typical one-shot decision problem. As mentioned in the same article, the main reason for such a decision was “demand is expected to peak in mid July or early August, so they need to begin work immediately to get the reactors up and running in time to avoid shortages.” In addition, Japan Real Time (May 18, 2012) said that without nuclear reactors the area of western Japan served by Kansai Electric had to keep power consumption between July and September to no more than 85% of peak usage during the hot summer of 2010.According to the one-shot decision theory, a person makes a one-shot decision based on some particular scenario (state) which is the most appropriate one for him/her while considering the satisfaction level incurred by this scenario and its possibility degree. The one-shot decision process is separated into two steps. The first step is to seek an appropriate scenario from all possible states for each alternative. This scenario is called as the focus point of the alternative. The second step is to evaluate the alternatives by the satisfaction levels incurred by the focus points for obtaining the optimal alternative. Twelve kinds of focus points are proposed to characterize the different preferences of decision makers for selecting scenarios (Guo, 2011). As an application, a duopoly market of a new product with a short life cycle is analyzed where three kinds of focus points, i.e. normal, active, and passive ones are considered. Possibilistic Cournot equilibriums are obtained for different types of pairs of firms in a duopoly market. The results of analysis are quite in agreement with the situations encountered in the real business world (Guo, 2010a; Guo, Yan, & Wang, 2010). The one-shot decision theory is also applied to private real estate investment problems (Guo, 2010b). The analysis tells the relation between the amount of uncertainty and the investment scale for different types of personal investors. The proposed models provide insights into personal real estate investment decisions and important policy implications to regulate urban land development. Recently, the research (Guo, 2014) clarifies the fundamental differences between the one-shot decision theory and other decision theories under uncertainty and points out the instinct problems in other decision theories to show that the one-shot decision theory is necessary to solve one-shot decision problems and manifests the relationship between the one-shot decision theory and the probabilistic decision methods.Multistage decisions refer to a series of interdependent decisions which are made at each stage to achieve a final result. Dynamic programming is a powerful vehicle for dealing with multistage decision-making problems (Bellman, 1957). The stochastic dynamic programming problems are used for handling multistage decision making under risk (e.g. Canakoglu & Ozekici, 2012; Chen, Ghate, & Tripathi, 2011; Cristobal, Escudero, & Monge, 2009; Flapper, Gayon, & Vercraene, 2012; Minis & Tatarakis, 2011; Shapiro, Tekaya, da Costa, & Soares, 2013). The stochastic dynamic programming problems are formulated as a maximization problem of the expected value with the assumption that the system under control is a Markov chain. Fuzzy dynamic programming problems are appropriate to deal with the ambiguity inherently existing in the human judgment for multistage decision-making problems (e.g. Kacprzyk, 1983; Kacprzyk & Esogbue, 1996; Li & Cheng, 2004; Li & Lai, 2001). Fuzzy dynamic programming problems introduce a fuzzy constraint and a fuzzy goal at each stage following Bellman and Zadeh’s framework (1970). Fuzzy dynamic programming problems are also well used for multiple objective dynamic programming problems (e.g. Abo-Sinna, 2004; Pal & Moitra, 2003). Sabbadin, Fargier, and Lang (1998) proposed the approaches to multistage decision making based on possibility and necessity measures of fuzzy events.Optimal stopping is an important topic in multistage decision-making situations (Shiryaev, 2007). There has been a continuous and increasing interest in stopping time literature (e.g. Engelage, 2011; Karpowicz, 2009; Lempa, 2012; Mahayni & Schoenmakers, 2011). Although most research has been done in the probabilistic framework, the fuzzy stopping time was taken into account by Kacprzyk (1978) in which the termination time was given as a specified fuzzy set. Kurano, Yasuda, Nakagami, and Yoshida (2002) proposed an approach to optimal stopping for a dynamic fuzzy system with fuzzy rewards. Yoshida, Yasuda, Nakagami, and Kurano (2003) addressed stopping models for a fuzzy stochastic system.In this research, we apply the one-shot decision theory to multistage one-shot decision problems under uncertainty. Multistage one-shot decision making is typical for such decision problems where at each stage a decision maker has one and only one chance to make a decision. We propose a general approach to multistage one-shot decision making under uncertainty. At each stage, a decision maker chooses one state for each alternative, called focus point with considering its possibility and the satisfaction level of the outcome which is associated with the chosen focus points at the succeeding stages. Based on the selected states (focus points), the sequence of optimal decisions is determined by dynamic programming.There are other researchers who have discussed the problems similar to the problem discussed in this research. We consider a possibilistic dynamic system under control similar to the problem examined by Sabbadin et al. (1998). However, we choose the optimal alternative in completely different ways. They used the optimistic and pessimistic utilities initially proposed by Yager (1979) and Whalen (1984) and axiomatized in the style of Savage by Dubois et al. (2001) with the core assumption of a qualitative commensurability between the possibility degree and the satisfaction level. The optimistic and pessimistic utilities are possibility and necessity measures of the fuzzy event, respectively. Their methods are possibilistic lottery-based whereas our methods are scenario-based. We evaluate the alternative by the outcome caused from the occurrence of its focus point (scenario). We have twelve kinds of focus points for making a decision in order to correspond to the decision maker’s different preference for selecting his/her appropriate scenarios. When choosing active and passive focus points, our approach can be reduced to optimistic and pessimistic utilities based methods if the possibility distribution and the satisfaction function satisfy some special conditions.This paper extends the existing literature in three important dimensions. First, a general approach to multistage one-shot decision making is proposed which extends the one-shot decision theory from the single stage to the multistage by means of dynamic programming. Second, based on the different types of focus points, we obtain twelve kinds of optimal decision paths to show which scenario at each stage is taken into account and why such a series of decisions is obtained for the twelve types of decision makers. Hence, the proposed approaches are scenario-based ones with greater appeal to intuition, simplicity of application and explicability. Third, the optimal stopping problem of the possibilistic dynamic system is theoretically analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, our research is the first in dealing with the optimal stopping problem in possibilistic dynamic systems.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The one-shot decision theory is briefly introduced in the next section. In Section 3, a general approach to multistage one-shot decision making is proposed. In Section 4, as a typical multistage decision problem, an optimal stopping problem is analyzed with the proposed decision approaches. Finally, concluding remarks are made in Section 5.In a one-shot decision problem, the set of an alternative a is A. The set of a state x is S. The degree to which a state x is to occur in the future is characterized by a possibility distribution π(x) defined below.Definition 1Given a function π: S→[0,1] if maxx∈Sπ(x)=1, then π(x) is called a possibility distribution where S is the sample space. π(x) is the possibility degree of x.The easy way to distinguish between possibility and probability is that there is not the additivity requirement for possibility. π(x)=1 means that it is normal that x occurs but does not mean that x is certain. π(x)=0 means that it is abnormal that x occurs but does not mean it absolutely does not appear. Due to the relaxation of the additivity, the possibility distribution is more feasible for the decision situation with partially known information (Guo, 2014). The methods for identifying possibility distributions based on similarity, potential surprise and voting are proposed in the papers (Guo, 2011; Guo & Tanaka, 2003; Guo et al., 2010).The consequence resulting from the combination of an alternative a and a state x is referred to as a payoff, denoted as v(x, a). The satisfaction level of a decision maker for a payoff can be expressed by a satisfaction function, as defined below.Definition 2Denote the set of the payoffs obtained by an alternative a as V(a). The function u: V(a)→[0,1] is called a satisfaction function of the alternative a if it satisfies u(v1)>u(v2) for v1>v2 where v1, v2∈V(a) and ∃v∈V(a), u(v)=1.The satisfaction function is used to represent the relative position of the payoff obtained from an alternative by the normalizing operator. Because the payoff is the function of x and a, we can also write the satisfaction function as u(x, a).The one-shot decision theory argues that a person makes a one-shot decision based on some particular state which is the most appropriate scenario for him/her while considering the satisfaction level incurred by it and its possibility degree. In other words, a decision maker chooses one state amongst all possible ones for each alternative. The selected state is called the focus point of this alternative. Determining the focus point depends on his/her attitude about possibility and satisfaction. Considering all combination of satisfaction and possibility, twelve types of focus points are provided to help a decision maker in finding out the states (scenarios) which are adequate for him/her. The characteristics of the twelve types of focus points are shown in Tables 1–3. Type IX focus point seems suitable for an active decision maker whereas Type X focus point seems suitable for an apprehensive decision maker because although some scenario has a lower possibility, it is still taken into account by a decision maker as it can cause a larger loss (lower satisfaction level). Type X focus point can be used to characterize the behavior of buying insurance. Type XI focus point seems suitable for a passive decision maker whereas Type XII focus point seems suitable for a daring decision maker because even if the possibility of some scenario is lower, a higher gain (higher satisfaction level) may lure a decision maker to consider such a situation. Type XII focus point can be used to characterize the behavior of buying lottery. Next, we provide mathematical formulas to find out the aforementioned twelve types of focus points.Type I focus point: The state (scenario) with the highest satisfaction and a high possibility to occur is obtained as(1)xα1∗(a)=arg maxx∈X⩾αu(x,a)whereX⩾α={x|π(x)⩾α}.The given parameter α is a level used to distinguish whether the possibility degree is evaluated as ‘high’ by a decision maker.xα1∗(a)is a Type I focus point of an alternative a.Type II focus point: The state (scenario) with the lowest satisfaction and a high possibility to occur is obtained as(2)xα2∗(a)=arg minx∈X⩾αu(x,a)whereX⩾α={x|π(x)⩾α}.xα2∗(a)is called a Type II focus point of an alternative a.Type III focus point: The state (scenario) with the highest satisfaction and a low possibility to occur is obtained as(3)xα3∗(a)=arg maxx∈X⩽αu(x,a)whereX⩽α={x|π(x)⩽α}.xα3∗(a)is called a Type III focus point of an alternative a.Type IV focus point: The state (scenario) with the lowest satisfaction and a low possibility to occur is obtained as(4)xα4∗(a)=arg minx∈X⩽αu(x,a)whereX⩽α={x|π(x)⩽α}.xα4∗(a)is called a Type IV focus point of an alternative a.Type V focus point: The state (scenario) with the highest possibility to occur and a high satisfaction is obtained as(5)xβ5∗(a)=arg maxx∈X⩾β(a)π(x)whereX⩾β(a)={x|u(x,a)⩾β}.The given parameter β is the level to distinguish whether the satisfaction level is evaluated as ‘high’ by a decision maker.xβ5∗(a)is a Type V focus point of an alternative a.Type VI focus point: The state (scenario) with the lowest possibility to occur and a high satisfaction is obtained as(6)xβ6∗(a)=arg minx∈X⩾β(a)π(x)whereX⩾β(a)={x|u(x,a)⩾β}.xβ6∗(a)is called a Type VI focus point of an alternative a.Type VII focus point: The state (scenario) with the highest possibility to occur and the low satisfaction is obtained as(7)xβ7∗(a)=arg maxx∈X⩽β(a)π(x)whereX⩽β(a)={x|u(x,a)⩽β}.xβ7∗(a)is called a Type VII focus point of an alternative a.Type VIII focus point: The state (scenario) with the lowest possibility to occur and the low satisfaction is obtained as(8)xβ8∗(a)=arg minx∈X⩽β(a)π(x)whereX⩽β(a)={x|u(x,a)⩽β}.xβ8∗(a)is called a Type VIII focus point of an alternative a.Type IX focus point: The state (scenario) with the higher possibility and the higher satisfaction is obtained as(9)x9∗(a)=arg maxx∈Smin[π(x),u(x,a)].x9∗(a)is called a Type IX focus point of an alternative a. It follows from (9) thatx=x9∗(a)maximizes g(x, a)=min[π(x), u(x, a)]. Because min[π(x), u(x, a)] represents the lower bound of the vector [π(x), u(x, a)], increasing min[π(x), u(x, a)] (maxx∈Smin[π(x), u(x, a)]) will increase the possibility degree and the satisfaction level simultaneously. Therefore,arg maxx∈Smin[π(x),u(x,a)]represents the state that has the higher possibility degree and the higher satisfaction level. For easily understanding (9), let us have a look at Fig. 1. There are four states x1, x2, x3 and x4 whose [π(x), u(x, a)] are [0.1,0.6], [0.3,0.2], [1.0,0.3] and [0.6,0.8] represented by A, B, C and D, respectively. min[π(x), u(x, a)] transfers A, B, C and D into A′, B′, C′, and D′, which are [0.1,0.1], [0.2,0.2], [0.3,0.3] and [0.6,0.6], respectively. maxx∈Smin[π(x), u(x, a)], that is, max([0.1,0.1], [0.2,0.2], [0.3,0.3], [0.6,0.6])=[0.6,0.6] corresponds to D′. Thus,arg maxx∈Smin[π(x),u(x,a)]chooses x4. It follows from Fig. 1 that x4 is a state with a higher possibility degree and a higher satisfaction level.Type X focus point: The state (scenario) with the lower possibility degree and the lower satisfaction level is obtained as(10)x10∗(a)=arg minx∈Smax[π(x),u(x,a)].x10∗(a)is called a Type X focus point of an alternative a. (10) shows thatx=x10∗(a)minimizes h(x, a)=max[π(x), u(x, a)]. Because max[π(x), u(x, a)] represents the upper bound of the vector [π(x), u(x, a)], decreasing max[π(x), u(x, a)] (minx∈Smax[π(x), u(x, a)]) will decrease the possibility degree and the satisfaction level simultaneously. Therefore,arg minx∈Smax[π(x),u(x,a)]is for seeking the state that has the lower possibility degree and the lower satisfaction level.Type XI focus point: The state (scenario) with the higher possibility degree and the lower satisfaction level is obtained as(11)x11∗(a)=arg minx∈Smax[1-π(x),u(x,a)].x11∗(a)is called a Type XI focus point of an alternative a.Type XII focus point: The state (scenario) with the lower possibility degree and the higher satisfaction level is obtained as(12)x12∗(a)=arg minx∈Smax[π(x),1-u(x,a)].x12∗(a)is called a Type XII focus point of an alternative a.Comments: From (9)–(12), we know that no other pair satisfiesπ(x)>π(x9∗(a))andu(x,a)>u(x9∗(a),a); orπ(x)<π(x10∗(a))andu(x,a)<u(x10∗(a),a); orπ(x)>π(x11∗(a))andu(x,a)<u(x11∗(a),a); orπ(x)<π(x12∗(a))andu(x,a)>u(x12∗(a),a). In other words, there is no state which has a higher possibility degree and a higher satisfaction level than the type IX focus point; a lower possibility degree and a lower satisfaction level than the type X focus point; a higher possibility degree and a lower satisfaction level than the type XI focus point; a lower possibility degree and a higher satisfaction level than the type XII focus point.For one alternative, more than one state might exist as one type of focus point. We denote the sets of twelve types of focus points of the alternative a asXα1(a),Xα2(a),Xα3(a),Xα4(a),Xβ5(a),Xβ6(a),Xβ7(a),Xβ8(a),X9(a),X10(a),X11(a), and X12(a), respectively. It should be noted thatXα3(a)andXα4(a)are empty sets when X⩽α=∅;Xβ7(a)andXβ8(a)are empty sets when X⩽β(a)=∅. For the sake of simplicity, in this paper we assume thatXα3(a),Xα4(a),Xβ7(a)andXβ8(a)are nonempty sets for any alternative a.The relations between different types of focus points are as follows (Guo, 2011):(I)Xα1(a)∪Xβ5(a)⊆X9(a)for α=β=maxx∈Smin(π(x), u(x, a)).Xα4(a)∪Xβ8(a)⊆X10(a)for α=β=minx∈Smax(π(x), u(x, a)).Xα2(a)∪Xβ7(a)⊆X11(a)for α=1−β=maxx∈Smin(π(x), 1−u(x, a)).Xα3(a)∪Xβ6(a)⊆X12(a)for 1−α=β=maxx∈Smin(1−π(x), u(x, a)).For any alternative a, the relationu(x9∗(a),a)<u(x11∗(a),a)does not hold.For any alternative a, if X10(a)∩X12(a)=∅, then the relationu(x10∗(a),a)>u(x12∗(a),a)does not hold.Ifu(x10∗(a),a)>u(x12∗(a),a)holds, there are three cases as follows:Case 1:u(x10∗(a),a)>u(x12∗(a),a)forπ(x10∗(a))>π(x12∗(a));u(x10∗(a),a)>u(x12∗(a),a)forπ(x10∗(a))<π(x12∗(a));u(x10∗(a),a)>u(x12∗(a),a)forπ(x10∗(a))=π(x12∗(a)).Considering the definitions ofx10∗(a)andx12∗(a), we know that the cases 1 and 2 are impossible to exist. For the case 3, there are three cases:(1)1−π(x10∗(a))=1−π(x12∗(a))⩾u(x10∗(a), a)>u(x12∗(a), a);u(x10∗(a), a)>1−π(x10∗(a))=1−π(x12∗(a))>u(x12∗(a), a);u(x10∗(a), a)>u(x12∗(a), a)⩾1−π(x10∗(a))=1−π(x12∗(a)).The relationx12∗(a)=arg minx∈Smax[π(x),1-u(x,a)]=arg maxx∈Smin[1-π(x),u(x,a)](Guo, 2011, Theorem 3) implies that the cases (1) and (2) are impossible to exist. For (3), there are three cases:(i)u(x10∗(a), a)>u(x12∗(a), a)⩾π(x10∗(a))=π(x12∗(a));u(x10∗(a), a)>π(x10∗(a))=π(x12∗(a))>u(x12∗(a), a);π(x10∗(a))=π(x12∗(a))⩾u(x10∗(a), a)>u(x12∗(a), a).It follows from the definition ofx10∗(a)that the cases (i) and (ii) are impossible to exist. Then we have π(x10∗(a))=π(x12∗(a))⩾u(x10∗(a), a)>u(x12∗(a), a)⩾1−π(x10∗(a))=1−π(x12∗(a)), which is excluded by the assumption X10(a)∩X12(a)=∅. □In a one-shot decision problem, a decision maker contemplates that the focus points are the most appropriate states (scenarios) for him/her and he/she chooses one alternative which can bring about the best consequence once the focus point (scenario) comes true. Since there are twelve types of focus points, there are twelve types of optimal alternatives, as shown below.(13)TypeIoptimalalternative:a1∗(α)=arg maxa∈Av(xα1∗(a),a).(14)TypeIIoptimalalternative:a2∗(α)=arg maxa∈Av(xα2∗(a),a).(15)TypeIIIoptimalalternative:a3∗(α)=arg maxa∈Av(xα3∗(a),a).(16)TypeIVoptimalalternative:a4∗(α)=arg maxa∈Av(xα4∗(a),a).(17)TypeVoptimalalternative:a5∗(β)=arg maxa∈Aminxβ5∗(a)∈Xβ5(a)v(xβ5∗(a),a).The maxmin operator is needed for the cases where multiple type V focus points of an alternative a exist. It reflects the conservative attitude of a decision maker.(18)TypeVIoptimalalternative:a6∗(β)=arg maxa∈Aminxβ6∗(a)∈Xβ6(a)v(xβ6∗(a),a).(19)TypeVIIoptimalalternative:a7∗(β)=arg maxa∈Aminxβ7∗(a)∈Xβ7(a)v(xβ7∗(a),a).(20)TypeVIIIoptimalalternative:a8∗(β)=arg maxa∈Aminxβ8∗(a)∈Xβ8(a)v(xβ8∗(a),a).(21)TypeIXoptimalalternative:a9∗=arg maxa∈Amaxx9∗(a)∈X9(a)v(x9∗(a),a).The maxmax operator is used for the cases where multiple type IX focus points of an alternative a exist. It reflects the aggressive attitude of a decision maker.(22)TypeXoptimalalternative:a10∗=arg maxa∈Aminx10∗(a)∈X10(a)v(x10∗(a),a).(23)TypeXIoptimalalternative:a11∗=arg maxa∈Aminx11∗(a)∈X11(a)v(x11∗(a),a).(24)TypeXIIoptimalalternative:a12∗=arg maxa∈Amaxx12∗(a)∈X12(a)v(x12∗(a),a).It should be noted that the payoff function v(x, a) is used for obtaining the optimal alternative in (13)–(24) instead of using the satisfaction function u(x, a).Comments: If some alternatives yield certain outcomes, such alternatives should be separated from the alternatives which lead to uncertain results. Suppose acis an alternative which yields the maximum certain outcome vc. For obtaining the optimal alternative, we should compare vcwithv(xi∗(ai∗),ai∗)(i=1,…,12).Theorem 3Given a possibility distribution π(x), for an alternative a, there are two payoff functions satisfying v1(x, a)⩽v2(x, a). u1(x, a) and u2(x, a) are satisfaction functions corresponding to v1(x, a) and v2(x, a), respectively. Denote the type XI focus point of a with the satisfaction function u1(x, a) asx1∗(a), the type IX focus point of a with the satisfaction function u2(x, a) asx2∗(a), that is,x1∗(a)=arg minxmax[1-π(x),u1(x,a)]andx2∗(a)=arg maxxmin[π(x),u2(x,a)]. SetX1∗(a)={x1∗(a)},X2∗(a)={x2∗(a)},x∗(a)=arg minx∈X1∗(a)v1(x,a)andx∗(a)=arg maxx∈X2∗(a)v2(x,a). We have(1)v1x1∗(a),a⩽v2x2∗(a),a;v1(x∗(a), a)⩽v2(x∗(a), a).(1) Considering the definitions of the type IX and XI focus points, we have(25)minπx2∗(a),u2x2∗(a),a⩾minπx1∗(a),u2x1∗(a),a,and(26)max1-πx2∗(a),u1x2∗(a),a⩾max1-πx1∗(a),u1x1∗(a),a.Let us consider the following three cases:(I)πx1∗(a)⩾u2x1∗(a),a.In this case, (25) leads tou2x1∗(a),a⩽u2x2∗(a),aso that(27)v2x1∗(a),a⩽v2x2∗(a),a.It follows from (27) and v1(x, a)⩽v2(x, a) thatv1x1∗(a),a⩽v2x2∗(a),aholds.1-πx2∗(a)⩽u1x2∗(a),a.In this case, (26) leads tou1x1∗(a),a⩽u1x2∗(a),a. Thus,(28)v1x1∗(a),a⩽v1x2∗(a),a.(28) and v1(x, a)⩽v2(x, a) makev1x1∗(a),a⩽v2x2∗(a),ahold.πx1∗(a)<u2x1∗(a),aand1-πx2∗(a)>u1x2∗(a),a.Supposev1x1∗(a),a⩽v2x2∗(a),adoes not hold in Case (III), that isv1x1∗(a),a>v2x2∗(a),ain this case. We havev1x1∗(a),a>v2x2∗(a),a⩾v1x2∗(a),aandv2x1∗(a),a⩾v1x1∗(a),a>v2x2∗(a),awhich lead to(29)u1x1∗(a),a>u1x2∗(a),a,and(30)u2x1∗(a),a>u2x2∗(a),a.(26) and (29) lead to(31)1-πx2∗(a)⩾1-πx1∗(a),that is(32)πx2∗(a)⩽πx1∗(a).From (25) and (30) we have(33)πx2∗(a)⩾πx1∗(a).(32) and (33) lead to(34)πx2∗(a)=πx1∗(a).The condition of Case (III) implies(35)πx2∗(a)=πx1∗(a)≠1.Suppose π(x0)=1. From the definition of the type IX focus point, we know(36)minπx2∗(a),u2x2∗(a),a⩾min[1,u2(x0,a)],so thatu2(x0,a)⩽u2x2∗(a),a, that is(37)v2(x0,a)⩽v2x2∗(a),a.From the definition of the type XI focus point, we have(38)max[0,u1(x0,a)]⩾max1-πx1∗(a),u1x1∗(a),a,so thatu1(x0,a)⩾u1x1∗(a),a, that is(39)v1(x0,a)⩾v1x1∗(a),a.(37) and (39) and the assumptionv1x1∗(a),a>v2x2∗(a),ain Case (III) lead to(40)v2(x0,a)⩽v2x2∗(a),a<v1x1∗(a),a⩽v1(x0,a).(40) and v1(x0, a)⩽v2(x0, a) are in conflict with each other so thatv1x1∗(a),a⩽v2x2∗(a),aholds in Case (III).(2) It is trivial to prove v1(x∗(a), a)⩽v2(x∗(a), a) if consideringv1x1∗(a),a⩽v2x2∗(a),a,x∗(a)=arg minx∈X1∗(a)v1(x,a)andx∗(a)=arg maxx∈X2∗(a)v2(x,a). □Given a possibility distribution π(x), for an alternative a, there are two payoff functions satisfying v1(x, a)⩽v2(x, a). u1(x, a) and u2(x, a) are satisfaction functions corresponding to v1(x, a) and v2(x, a), respectively. Denote the type X focus point of a with the satisfaction function u1(x, a) asx1∗(a), the type XII focus point of a with the satisfaction function u2(x, a) asx2∗(a), that is,x1∗(a)=arg minxmax[π(x),u1(x,a)]andx2∗(a)=arg minxmax[π(x),1-u2(x,a)]. SetX1∗(a)=x1∗(a),X2∗(a)=x2∗(a),x∗(a)=arg minx∈X1∗(a)v1(x,a)andx∗(a)=arg maxx∈X2∗(a)v2(x,a). We have(1)IfX1∗(a)∩X2∗(a)=∅, thenv1x1∗(a),a<v2x2∗(a),a;v1(x∗(a), a)⩽v2(x∗(a), a).(1) Considering the definitions of the type X and XII focus points andX1∗(a)∩X2∗(a)=∅, we have(41)maxπx2∗(a),u1x2∗(a),a>maxπx1∗(a),u1x1∗(a),a,and(42)maxπx2∗(a),1-u2x2∗(a),a<maxπx1∗(a),1-u2x1∗(a),a.Formaxπx2∗(a),u1x2∗(a),a, there are three cases as follows:(I)maxπx2∗(a),u1x2∗(a),a=u1x2∗(a),a,u1x2∗(a),a.In this case, (41) makesu1(x2∗(a),a)>u1x1∗(a),ahold so that(43)v1x1∗(a),a<v1x2∗(a),a.(43) and v1(x, a)⩽v2(x, a) makev1x1∗(a),a<v2x2∗(a),ahold.maxπx1∗(a),1-u2x1∗(a),a=1-u2x1∗(a),a,1-u2x1∗(a),a.In Case (II), from (42) we knowu2x1∗(a),a<u2x2∗(a),aholds. It means(44)v2x1∗(a),a<v2x2∗(a),a.Based on (44) and v1(x, a)⩽v2(x, a), we havev1x1∗(a),a<v2x2∗(a),a.maxπx2∗(a),u1x2∗(a),a=πx2∗(a),πx2∗(a)andmaxπx1∗(a),1-u2x1∗(a),a=πx1∗(a),πx1∗(a).In this case, we have(45)πx2∗(a)⩾u1x2∗(a),a,and(46)πx1∗(a)⩾1-u2x1∗(a),a.Supposev1x1∗(a),a<v2x2∗(a),adoes not hold in Case (III), that is,v1x1∗(a),a⩾v2x2∗(a),ain Case (III). This assumption makesv1x1∗(a),a⩾v2x2∗(a),a⩾v1x2∗(a),aandv2x1∗(a),a⩾v1x1∗(a),a⩾v2x2∗(a),ahold so that we have(47)u1x1∗(a),a⩾u1x2∗(a),a,and(48)u2x1∗(a),a⩾u2x2∗(a),a.From (41) and (47) we have(49)πx2∗(a)>πx1∗(a).From (42) and (48) we have(50)πx2∗(a)<πx1∗(a).(49) and (50) are in conflict with each other so thatv1x1∗(a),a<v2x2∗(a),aholds in Case (III).(2) We know thatv1x1∗(a),a⩽v2x2∗(a),aholds forX1∗(a)∩X2∗(a)=∅. IfX1∗(a)∩X2∗(a)≠∅, let us denote one element ofX1∗(a)∩X2∗(a)as xo. Becausex∗(a)=arg minx∈X1∗(a)v1(x,a),x∗(a)=arg maxx∈X2∗(a)v2(x,a),xo∈X1∗(a)∩X2∗(a)and v1(x, a)⩽v2(x, a) hold, we have(51)v1(x∗(a),a)⩽v1(xo,a)⩽v2(xo,a)⩽v2(x∗(a),a).Thus, v1(x∗(a), a)⩽v2(x∗(a), a) always holds. □Comments: (Guo, 2014) What are the differences between the subjective expected utility theory (SEU) and the one-shot decision theory (OSD)?Comparison 1: In SEU, there are two steps as follows:Step 1: Evaluating each alternative by the weighted average utility of all outcomes.Step 2: Selecting the alternative with the maximum average.In OSD, there are two steps as follows:Step 1: Seeking a state (focus point) for each alternative.Step 2: Choosing the alternative with the maximum outcome of the focus point.Comparison 2: In SEU, a utility function is associated with risky situations. If a person is a risk averter, the utility function is concave. If a person is a risk taker, the utility function is convex. If a person is risk neutral, the utility function is linear. In OSD, the satisfaction function has no relation with risk situations, which represents the relative position of the payoff. Which type of focus point is used for making a decision reflects the attitude of a decision maker to uncertainty.Comparison 3: SEU uses the subjective probability to characterize the uncertainty whereas OSD utilizes the possibility distribution.Comparison 4: SEU and OSD explain why some alternative is optimal in completely different ways. An alternative is evaluated by SEU based on the average. If the optimal alternative is repeated a large number of times, the total payoff obtained almost surely attains the maximum in the sense of the strong law of large numbers, whereas OSD gives a clear answer to why some alternative is optimal when only one decision chance is left to a decision maker.For easily understanding how to make a decision with the one-shot decision theory, a numerical example is given below.Example 1The sets of alternatives and states are A={a1, a2, a3} and S={x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6}, respectively. The payoff on each state obtained for each alternative is listed in Table 4. For illustrative purposes, let us assume that the estimated possibility degrees of states and the satisfaction levels for three alternatives on each state are shown in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. We set α as 0.68 and β as 0.78 so that the states are classified into the following groups according to possibility degrees and satisfaction levels; that is, X⩾α={x2, x3, x4} (a high possibility group), X⩽α={x1, x5, x6} (a low possibility group), X⩾β(a1)={x1, x2, x3} (a high satisfaction group for a1), X⩽β(a1)={x4, x5, x6} (a low satisfaction group for a1), X⩾β(a2)={x3, x4, x5, x6}, X⩽β(a2)={x1, x2}, X⩾β(a3)={x5, x6} and X⩽β(a3)={x1, x2, x3, x4}. According to (1)–(12), all types of focus points for all alternatives are obtained and listed in Table 7. Let us give the detail for obtainingx9∗(a2),x10∗(a2),x11∗(a3)andx12∗(a3)as follows: In (9), maxx∈Smin[π(x), u(x, a2)] are(52)max{min[0.4,0.4],min[0.7,0.76],min[0.8,1],min[1,0.96],min[0.6,0.88],min[0.2,0.8]}=max{[0.4,0.4],[0.7,0.7],[0.8,0.8],[0.96,0.96],[0.6,0.6],[0.2,0.2]}=[0.96,0.96].Since x4 corresponds to [0.96,0.96], we have(53)x9∗(a2)=arg maxx∈Smin[π(x),u(x,a2)]=x4.It is clear that x4 has a higher possibility and a higher satisfaction for a2. In (10), minx∈Smax[π(x), u(x, a2)] are(54)min{max[0.4,0.4],max[0.7,0.76],max[0.8,1],max[1,0.96],max[0.6,0.88],max[0.2,0.8]}=min{[0.4,0.4],[0.76,0.76],[1,1],[1,1],[0.88,0.88],[0.8,0.8]}=[0.4,0.4].Since x1 corresponds to [0.4,0.4], we have(55)x10∗(a2)=arg minx∈Smax[π(x),u(x,a2)]=x1.It is clear that x1 has a lower possibility and a lower satisfaction for a2. In (11), minx∈Smax[1−π(x), u(x, a3)] are(56)min{max[0.6,0],max[0.3,0.25],max[0.2,0.5],max[0,0.75],max[0.4,1],max[0.8,0.8]}=min{[0.6,0.6],[0.3,0.3],[0.5,0.5],[0.75,0.75],[1,1],[0.8,0.8]}=[0.3,0.3].Since x2 corresponds to [0.3,0.3], we have(57)x11∗(a3)=arg minx∈Smax[1-π(x),u(x,a3)]=x2.It is clear that x2 has a higher possibility and a lower satisfaction for a3. In (12), minx∈Smax[π(x),1−u(x, a3)] are(58)min{max[0.4,1],max[0.7,0.75],max[0.8,0.5],max[1,0.25],max[0.6,0],max[0.2,0.2]}=min{[1,1],[0.75,0.75],[0.8,0.8],[1,1],[0.6,0.6],[0.2,0.2]}=[0.2,0.2].Since x6 corresponds to [0.2,0.2], we have(59)x12∗(a3)=arg minx∈Smax[π(x),1-u(x,a3)]=x6.It is clear that x6 has a lower possibility and a higher satisfaction for a3. The payoffs provided by each alternative for twelve types of focus points are listed in Table 8. According to (13)–(24), twelve types of optimal alternatives are a3, a2, a3, {a1, a2}, a3, a3, a3, {a1, a2}, a3, {a1, a2}, a1 and a3, respectively.Let us consider multistage decision making under uncertainty. If at each stage there is one and only one chance for a decision maker to make a decision with partially known information, we call such a decision problem as a multistage one-shot decision problem. In a multistage one-shot decision problem, the length of decision periods is T. The initial decision is at stage 0, and the last decision is at stage T−1. At={at,i} and Xt={xt,k} are the sets of alternatives and states at stage t, respectively. When we choose at,iat stage t, the possible state at stage t+1 is an element of Xt+1(t=0,…,T−1). Xt+1 is governed by a possibility distribution defined below.Definition 3A possibility distribution at t+1 stage associated with an alternative at,iand a state xt,kis a functionπt+1at,i,xt,k:Xt+1→[0,1]satisfyingmaxπt+1at,i,xt,k(x)=1.The state xt,kat stage t will turn into x∈Xt+1 at stage t+1 with the possibility degreeπt+1at,i,xt,k(x)for an alternative at,i. Denote ct+1(xt,k, at,i, xt+1,j) as the cost generated by the state transition from xt,kto xt+1,jwhen we choose at,i. The set of the costs corresponding to xt,kand at,iis expressed as Ct+1(xt,k, at,i)={ct+1(xt,k, at,i, xt+1,j)}.Given At, Xt, Ct+1(xt,k, at,i) andπt+1at,i,xt,k(x)for any xt,k, at,i, t=0,…,T−1 and XT, multistage one-shot decision making is to choose an optimal alternative at each stage when there is one and only one chance for a decision maker to make a decision at each stage. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the sets of all types of focus points at each stage are singleton in this section. Let us first consider the last decision at stage T−1.One-shot decision making at stageT−1:The decision at the last decision stage T−1 is a typical one-shot decision. We introduce the satisfaction function at stage T as follows:Definition 4The function uT: CT(xT−1,k, aT−1,i)→[0,1] is called a satisfaction function of aT−1,iwith xT−1,kat stage T if it satisfies uT(w1)>uT(w2) for any w1<w2, w1, w2∈CT(xT−1,k, aT−1,i) and ∃w∈CT(xT−1,k, aT−1,i), uT(w)=1.With the satisfaction functions at stage T, the decision-making procedure is described as follows:Step 1: Seek the focus point for each aT−1,i∈AT−1 with any state xT−1,k∈XT−1. Twelve types of focus points are taken into account whereπTaT-1,i,xT-1,k(xT,j)and uT(cT(xT−1,k, aT−1,i, xT,j)) correspond to π(x) and u(x, a) in (1)–(12), respectively. Denote the obtained focus point of aT−1,iwith xT−1,kassT∗(xT-1,k,aT-1,i). We have(60)sT∗(xT-1,k,aT-1,i)=argF(πTaT-1,i,xT-1,k(xT,j),uT(cT(xT-1,k,aT-1,i,xT,j))),where F(·) represents a general form for seeking one of twelve types’ focus points. For example, if we set F(·)=maxxmin(·), then (60) becomes (9).Step 2: The optimal alternativedT-1∗(xT-1,k)is obtained as follows:(61)dT-1∗(xT-1,k)=arg mind∈AT-1cT(xT-1,k,d,sT∗(xT-1,k,d)).Denote(62)f1(xT-1,k)=mind∈AT-1cT(xT-1,k,d,sT∗(xT-1,k,d)),which is the minimum transition cost of the path from xT−1,kto a focus point at the final stage T.Next, we consider the decision at stages T−n, n=2,3,…,T. Suppose that the state is xT−n,kand we choose aT−n,iat stage T−n. A path from T−n to T can be divided into the two sub-paths: the one from T−n to T−n+1 and the other from T−n+1 to T. Set(63)gT-n+1(xT-n,k,aT-n,i,xT-n+1,j)=cT-n+1(xT-n,k,aT-n,i,xT-n+1,j)+fn-1(xT-n+1,j),which is the total transition cost generated from T−n to T when the state at T−n is xT−n,k, the alternative taken is aT−n,iand the state at T−n+1 becomes xT−n+1,j. Set(64)GT-n+1(xT-n,k,aT-n,i)={gT-n+1(xT-n,k,aT-n,i,xT-n+1,j)}={cT-n+1(xT-n,k,aT-n,i,xT-n+1,j)+fn-1(xT-n+1,j)}.The satisfaction function of aT−n,iwith xT−n,kat stage T−n+1 is given as(65)uT-n+1:GT-n+1(xT-n,k,aT-n,i)→[0,1],which satisfies uT−n+1(w1)>uT−n+1(w2), for any w1<w2, w1, w2∈GT−n+1(xT−n,k, aT−n,i) and ∃w∈GT−n+1(xT−n,k, aT−n,i), uT−n+1(w)=1. With the satisfaction functions at stage T−n+1, we can make the following decision.One-shot decision making at stageT−n:Step 1: Find out the focus point of any aT−n,iwith any state xT−n,k. Denote the focus point of aT−n,iwith xT−n,kassT-n+1∗(xT-n,k,aT-n,i). It can be obtained as(66)sT-n+1∗(xT-n,k,aT-n,i)=argFπT-n+1xT-n,k,aT-n,i(xT-n+1,j),uT-n+1(gT-n+1(xT-n,k,aT-n,i,xT-n+1,j)).It is nature to choose the same type of focus point as the one obtained at the previous stages due to logic consistency.Step 2: Obtain the optimal action as(67)dT-n∗(xT-n,k)=arg mind∈AT-ncT-n+1xT-n,k,d,sT-n+1∗(xT-n,k,d)+fn-1sT-n+1∗(xT-n,k,d).Denote(68)fn(xT-n,k)=mind∈AT-ncT-n+1xT-n,k,d,sT-n+1∗(xT-n,k,d)+fn-1sT-n+1∗(xT-n,k,d).fi(x) represents the minimum transition cost along the path which consists of the focus points in the remaining i stages with the state x in stage T−i. Taking n from 2 to T in (63)–(68), the sequences of twelve types of optimal decisions with the initial state x0 can be obtained and the trajectories of twelve types of focus points can be constructed ass1∗x0,d0∗(x0),s2∗s1∗,d1∗s1∗,…,sT∗sT-1∗,dT-1∗sT-1∗.Comments:(68) is the optimality equation in multistage one-shot decision problems. Comparing with the optimality equation in stochastic dynamic programming problems, the transition cost associated with the focus points in multistage one-shot decision problems takes the place of the expected transition cost in stochastic dynamic programming problems. Because one and only one state occurs while making a decision at each stage, (68) is reasonable for multistage one-shot decision making.Definition 5A dynamic possibilistic system is called a possibilistic time-invariant system if and only if the states and possibility distributions remain the same at each stage.In a possibilistic time-invariant system with infinite discrete states {0,1,2,…}, the possibility distribution of the states associated with an alternative a can be represented by an infinite possibilistic transition matrix Pa=[pij]. Its entry pij=π(i, j)=π(xt+1=j∣xt=i) is the possibility degree to which the state i given now will turn into the state j at the next stage satisfying pij⩾0 and maxj∈{0,1,2,…}pij=1 for ∀i∈{0,1,2,…}. The following numerical example is used to illustrate how to make a multistage one-shot decision.Example 2Consider a possibilistic time-invariant system with finite states. The set of states is X={0,1,2} and the set of actions is A={a1, a2}. We set T=2. The possibilistic transition matrix associated with a1 is given by the following matrix(69)Pa1=100010001.The possibilistic transition matrix associated with a2 is(70)Pa2=010.40.7010.810.The cost generated by a1 is always 1. Taking the action a2, if xt+1>xt, the cost is 0.5, otherwise the cost is 2. If only one decision chance is given at each stage, let us consider how to make a decision to minimize the total cost.At the last decision stage, the decision is a typical one-shot decision. For any state x1,kand action a1,i, we set the satisfaction function at stage 2 as(71)u2(x1,k,a1,i,x2,j)=minlc2(x1,k,a1,i,x2,l)c2(x1,k,a1,i,x2,j).(71) shows that the satisfaction level of the lowest cost is 1 and the lower the cost, the more satisfied. Using (71), we have u2(i, a1,1, j)=1 for i, j∈{0,1,2}, u2(0,a1,2,0)=0.25, u2(0,a1,2,1)=1, u2(0,a1,2,2)=1, u2(1,a1,2,0)=0.25, u2(1,a1,2,1)=0.25, u2(1,a1,2,2)=1, u2(2,a1,2,0)=1, u2(2,a1,2,1)=1 and u2(2,a1,2,2)=1. In this example, let us only consider the type IX focus point, that is, F(·)=maxxmin(·). Using (60), the focus points of a1,1 and a1,2 are obtained as follows:s2∗(i,a1,1)=ifor i∈{0,1,2},s2∗(0,a1,2)=1,s2∗(1,a1,2)=2ands2∗(2,a1,2)=1. Using (61), we know the optimal actions are as follows:d1∗(0)=a2,d1∗(1)=a2andd1∗(2)=a1. According to (62), we have f1(0)=f1(1)=0.5 and f1(2)=1.Next, let us consider the decision at stage 0. Using (63), we can calculateg1(0,a0,1,0)=c1(0,a0,1,0)+f1(0)=1+0.5=1.5,g1(0,a0,1,1)=c1(0,a0,1,1)+f1(1)=1+0.5=1.5,g1(0,a0,1,2)=c1(0,a0,1,2)+f1(2)=1+1=2,g1(1,a0,1,0)=c1(1,a0,1,0)+f1(0)=1+0.5=1.5,g1(1,a0,1,1)=c1(1,a0,1,1)+f1(1)=1+0.5=1.5,g1(1,a0,1,2)=c1(1,a0,1,2)+f1(2)=1+1=2,g1(2,a0,1,0)=c1(2,a0,1,0)+f1(0)=1+0.5=1.5,g1(2,a0,1,1)=c1(2,a0,1,1)+f1(1)=1+0.5=1.5,g1(2,a0,1,2)=c1(2,a0,1,2)+f1(2)=1+1=2,g1(0,a0,2,0)=c1(0,a0,2,0)+f1(0)=2+0.5=2.5,g1(0,a0,2,1)=c1(0,a0,2,1)+f1(1)=0.5+0.5=1,g1(0,a0,2,2)=c1(0,a0,2,2)+f1(2)=0.5+1=1.5,g1(1,a0,2,0)=c1(1,a0,2,0)+f1(0)=2+0.5=2.5,g1(1,a0,2,1)=c1(1,a0,2,1)+f1(1)=2+0.5=2.5,g1(1,a0,2,2)=c1(1,a0,2,2)+f1(2)=0.5+1=1.5,g1(2,a0,2,0)=c1(2,a0,2,0)+f1(0)=2+0.5=2.5,g1(2,a0,2,1)=c1(2,a0,2,1)+f1(1)=2+0.5=2.5andg1(2,a0,2,2)=c1(2,a0,2,2)+f1(2)=2+1=3.The satisfaction function at stage 1 is defined as(72)u1(x0,k,a0,i,x1,j)=minlg1(x0,k,a0,i,x1,l)g1(x0,k,a0,i,x1,j).We have u1(0,a0,1,0)=1, u1(0,a0,1,1)=1, u1(0,a0,1,2)=0.75, u1(1,a0,1,0)=1, u1(1,a0,1,1)=1, u1(1,a0,1,2)=0.75, u1(2,a0,1,0)=1, u1(2,a0,1,1)=1, u1(2,a0,1,2)=0.75, u1(0,a0,2,0)=0.4, u1(0,a0,2,1)=1, u1(0,a0,2,2)=0.67, u1(1,a0,2,0)=0.6, u1(1,a0,2,1)=0.6, u1(1,a0,2,2)=1, u1(2,a0,2,0)=1, u1(2,a0,2,1)=1 and u1(2,a0,2,2)=0.83. Using (66), the focus points of a0,1 and a0,2 are obtained as follows:s1∗(i,a0,1)=ifori∈{0,1,2},s1∗(0,a0,2)=1,s1∗(1,a0,2)=2ands1∗(2,a0,2)=1. Using (67), we know the optimal actions are as follows:d0∗(0)=a2,d0∗(1)={a1,a2}andd0∗(2)=a1. Assume that the initial state is 0, then the sequence of optimal actions is {a2, a2} and the trajectory of the type IX focus points is from 1 to 2.As a typical multistage decision problem under uncertainty, an optimal stopping problem involves only two possible alternatives: stopping or continuing. Solving this problem involves finding out the optimal time at which a decision maker stops a process to obtain the best “goodness”. In this section, we consider a one-shot optimal stopping problem, that is, at each stage a decision maker has one and only one chance to choose an alternative: stopping or continuing. If a decision maker chooses continuing then the process will proceed to the next step. If a decision maker chooses stopping then the process will end. Let us examine an example of an individual house-selling problem. As Kummerow (2002) mentioned, real estate assets are heterogeneous. There are hundreds of factors, such as, age, location, site/view, design/appeal, room count, gross living area and functional utility that might affect prices in various situations. Moreover, properties trade infrequently, perhaps once every 5–10years for the average house. In general there are few sales of properties similar enough to be “comparable” and probably none of identical properties. Due to lack of enough information on properties, using possibility distributions to characterize the uncertainty of the housing price is more desirable (Guo, 2010b). For an individual house owner, at each stage he/she has one and only one chance to make a decision: selling the house or waiting for a better offer. That is, he/she has to choose an optimal stopping time. This problem is a typical one-shot optimal stopping problem.Let us examine a one-shot optimal stopping problem in a possibilistic time-invariant system with infinite discrete states {0,1,2,…}. Suppose that the reward for stopping and the cost for continuing do not depend on t. If a decision maker decides stopping at the state k, the reward for stopping is rk. The cost associated with the transition from the state j to the state l is cjl, j, l∈{0,1,2,…}.Assume that we are permitted at most m further steps before stopping with the initial state j0=i and vi(m) is the maximum net reward if the path of focus points in the succeeding m stages can be realized. In this section, we usej1∗,j2∗,…,jm∗to denote the focus points of continuing with an initial state j0=i at stages 1,…,m, respectively. Setting m=1, thenvi(1)=maxri,-cij1∗+vj1∗(0)where vi(0)=ri. Given xt=i, we have the following optimality equation at any stage t∈{0,1,…,m−1}(73)vi(m-t)=maxri,-cij∗+vj∗(m-t-1),where j∗ is one type focus point of continuing at stage t+1. The stopping set denoted as S(m−t) is defined as(74)S(m-t)={i:vi(m-t)=ri},which means that a state at stage t falls into S(m−t), the process will stop at stage t. The first time that the process with the initial state i reaches a state in S(m−t) is denoted as Ti(m) and defined as(75)Ti(m)=min{t:xt∈S(m-t)}.Accordingly, the continuation set is(76)C(m-t)={i:vi(m-t)>ri},which means that a state at stage t falls into C(m−t), the process will continue at stage t.For easily understanding the one-shot optimal stopping problem, a numerical example is given below.Example 3Suppose the set of states is S={2,5,8,10} and the set of alternatives is A={a1, a2} where a1 represents continuing and a2 represents stopping. The reward for stopping on the state j∈S is rj=j. The possibilistic transition matrix is as follows:(77)P=010.60.20.8010.40.3100.70.20.610.The transition cost is cij=1 (∀i, j∈S). Setting m=3, the satisfaction function of a1 at stage t+1 is given as(78)ut+1(i,a1,j)=-cij+vj(m-t-1)maxl(-cil+vl(m-t-1)),t=0,1,2.For the purpose of illustration, let us only consider the one-shot optimal stopping problem with the type IX focus point as follows:(1)The stage t=2 (the last decision stage): The satisfaction function of a1 at stage 3 isu3(i,a1,j)=-cij+rjmaxl(-cil+rl). For any state i∈S, we have u3(i,a1,2)=0.11, u3(i,a1,5)=0.44, u3(i,a1,8)=0.78 and u3(i,a1,10)=1. The type IX focus points of continuing are obtained as follows: s3(2, a1)=8, s3(5, a1)=8, s3(8, a1)=10 and s3(10, a1)=8. Thus, we have v2(1)=max{r2, r8−1}=max{2,8−1}=7, v5(1)=max{r5, r8−1}=max{5,8−1}=7, v8(1)=max{r8, r10−1}=max{8,10−1}=9 and v10(1)=max{r10, r8−1}=max{10,8−1}=10. The optimal actions at this stage are as follows: d2(2)=a1 (continuing), d2(5)=a1 (continuing), d2(8)=a1 (continuing) and d2(10)=a2 (stopping).The stage t=1: The satisfaction function of a1 at stage 2 isu2(i,a1,j)=-cij+vj(1)maxl(-cil+vl(1)). For any state i∈S, we have u2(i,a1,2)=0.67, u2(i,a1,5)=0.67, u2(i,a1,8)=0.89 and u2(i,a1,10)=1. The type IX focus points of continuing are obtained as follows: s2(2, a1)=5, s2(5,a1)=8, s2(8,a1)=10 and s2(10, a1)=8. Then we can calculate v2(2)=max{r2, v5(1)−1}=max{2,6}=6, v5(2)=max{r5, v8(1)−1}=max{5,8}=8, v8(2)=max{r8, v10(1)−1}=max{8,9}=9 and v10(2)=max{r10, v8(1)−1}=max{10,8}=10. The optimal actions at this stage are as follows: d1(2)=a1 (continuing), d1(5)=a1 (continuing), d1(8)=a1 (continuing) and d1(10)=a2 (stopping).The stage t=0: The satisfaction function of a1 at stage 1 isu1(i,a1,j)=-cij+vj(2)maxl(-cil+vl(2)). For any state i∈S, we have u1(i,a1,2)=0.56, u1(i,a1,5)=0.78, u1(i,a1,8)=0.89 and u1(i,a1,10)=1. The type IX focus points of continuing are obtained as follows: s1(2, a1)=5, s1(5, a1)=8, s1(8, a1)=5 and s1(10, a1)=8. Then we can calculate v2(3)=max{r2, v5(2)−1}=max{2,7}=7, v5(3)=max{r5, v8(2)−1}=max{2,8}=8, v8(3)=max{r8, v5(2)−1}=max{8,7}=8 and v10(2)=max{r10, v8(2)−1}=max{10,8}=10. The optimal actions at this stage are as follows: d0(2)=a1 (continuing), d0(5)=a1 (continuing), d0(8)=a2 (stopping) and d0(10)=a2 (stopping).In this example, we have T2(3)=3, T5(3)=2, T8(3)=0, T10(3)=0, S(3)={8,10}, S(2)={10}, S(1)={10}, C(3)={2,5}, C(2)={2,5,8} and C(1)={2,5,8}. For the initial state 2, the sequence of the type IX optimal decisions is {a1,a1,a1} and the trajectory of the type IX focus point is 5→8→10. Interestingly, v8(3)<v8(2) holds in this example. So that vi(t)⩾vi(t−1) does not always hold. It means that having more stages to make a decision might not be more beneficial in the sense that the increase of decision stages can lead to much uncertainty. Such a phenomenon is well encountered in the real world.Proposition 5For anyk∈{1,…,m-1},jk+1∗,…,jm∗are the focus points of continuing at the succeeding stages 1,…, m−k with the initial statejk∗.Suppose 0⩽rk⩽r and cjl⩾c>0 hold for any k, j, l∈{0,1,2,…} where r and c are two positive constants. We have(1)For any i and m, ri⩽vi(m)⩽r holds;If vi(m) is a non-decreasing function of m, when m→∞, vi(m)→vi⩽r holds.(1) For any i and m, we have the following optimality equation(79)vi(m)=maxri,-cij1∗+vj1∗(m-1)=maxri,-cij1∗+rj1∗,-cij1∗-cj1∗j2∗+vj2∗(m-2)=maxri,-cij1∗+rj1∗,…,-cij1∗-cj1∗j2∗-⋯+rjm∗.Since 0⩽rk⩽r and cjl⩾c>0 hold for any k, j, l∈{0,1,2,…}, we have(80)ri⩽vi(m)⩽r.(2) If vi(m) is a non-decreasing function of m, that is,(81)vi(m+1)⩾vi(m),then the sequence {vi(m), m=0,1,2,…} is monotone and bounded. When m→∞, vi(m)→vi⩽r holds. □The maximum possible net reward vi(m) is attained at the stopping time Ti(m).Setting m=1, for any i we have(82)vi(1)=maxri,-cij1∗+rj1∗.If i∈S(1) then we have Ti(1)=0 and vi(1)=ri; else i∈C(1) and Ti(1)=1 hold which leads tovi(1)=-cij1∗+rj1∗, that is the net reward after transition. Similarly, setting m=2, for any i we know(83)vi(2)=maxri,-cij1∗+vj1∗(1).There are two cases: either i∈S(2) and Ti(2)=0 or i∈C(2) and Ti(2)⩾1. In the first case vi(2)=riand in the second case Ti(2) takes 1 or 2 according to whether the first transitioni→j1∗leads to a state in S(1) or C(1). In the second case, we haveTi(2)=1+Tj1∗(1). SinceTj1∗(1)is the stopping time at whichvj1∗(1)is attained, we know(84)vi(2)=-cij1∗+vj1∗(1)holds at Ti(2). By repeating the same procedure, we can establish the general result that the maximum net reward vi(m) is attained at the stopping time Ti(m). □We have the following properties:(1)Ifri⩾rjs∗holds for any 1⩽s⩽m, then Ti(m)=0.Given a constant transition cost c, ifrjk∗-ri⩽kcholds for any 1⩽k⩽m, then Ti(m)=0.Given a constant transition cost c, if there exists 1⩽l⩽m such thatrjl∗-ri>lcholds andrjk∗-ri⩽kcholds for any 0⩽k<l, the decision “continuing” should be made at least during the first l decision steps.(1) With considering (79), the fact that∀1⩽s⩽m,ri⩾rjs∗holds leads to vi(m)=riso that i∈S(m) and Ti(m)=0.(2) Sincerjk∗-ri⩽kcholds for any 1⩽k⩽m, we have(85)vi(m)=maxri,-c+vj1∗(m-1)=maxri,-c+rj1∗,-2c+rj2∗,…,-mc+rjm∗=ri.Therefore, i∈S(m) and Ti(m)=0.(3) Since∃l,rjl∗-ri>lcholds, we have(86)vi(m)=maxri,-c+vj1∗(m-1)=maxri,-c+rj1∗,…,-lc+rjl∗,…,-mc+rjm∗>ri,so that the decision at the first decision step (stage 0) should be “continuing”. Thus,j1∗becomes a new initial state and m replaced by m−1. We have(87)vj1∗(m-1)=maxrj1∗,-c+vj2∗(m-2)=maxrj1∗,-c+rj2∗,…,-(l-1)c+rjl∗,…,-(m-1)c+rjm∗,where l>1. Consideringrj1∗-ri⩽candrjl∗-ri>lc, we knowvj1∗(m-1)>rj1∗. Therefore, the decision at the second decision step (stage 1) is also “continuing”. Such a procedure can be repeated at least during the first l decision steps because∀1<l⩽m,vjl-1∗(m-l+1)=maxrjl-1∗,-c+rjl∗,…,-(m-l+1)c+rjm∗>rjl-1∗holds. □Given a possibilistic time-invariant system, a sequence of states {x0, x1,…,xl} is said to be connected if and only if the focus point of continuing is chosen as xk+1 when the state at the last decision stage is xkfor any k∈{0,…,l−1}.Ifj0,j1∗,…,jm-1∗is connected andj1∗,…,jm-1∗⊆S(1)holds, we havevj0(m)=vj0(1).Due tojm-1∗∈S(1), we knowvjm-1∗(1)=rjm-1∗. According to Proposition 5, we have(88)vjm-2∗(2)=maxrjm-2∗,-cjm-2∗jm-1∗+vjm-1∗(1)=maxrjm-2∗,-cjm-2∗jm-1∗+rjm-1∗.Sincej0,j1∗,…,jm-1∗is connected, we have(89)vjm-2∗(1)=max{rjm-2∗,-cjm-2∗jm-1∗+rjm-1∗}.(88) and (89) andjm-2∗∈S(1)lead to(90)vjm-2∗(2)=vjm-2∗(1)=rjm-2∗.Similarly, we can obtain(91)vj1∗(m-1)=maxrj1∗,-cj1∗j2∗+rj2∗=vj1∗(1)=rj1∗.Thus,vj0(m)=max{rj0,-cj0j1∗+vj1∗(m-1)}=max{rj0,-cj0j1∗+rj1∗}=vj0(1)holds. □Theorem 9 implies that ifj0,j1∗,…,jm-1∗is connected andj1∗,…,jm-1∗⊆S(1)holds, for judging whether to continue or stop, the only thing we should do is to look at one step ahead to decide whether there is an advantage in taking a single step. This rule is called the one-step look-ahead rule in the one-shot optimal stopping problem.Definition 7Suppose there are two satisfaction functions uA,t+1 and uB,t+1 for the decision “continuing” at stage t+1(t=0,…,m−1). uA,t+1(l,j) and uB,t+1(l, j) are two satisfaction levels of the net reward gained by the transition from the state l to the state j. If (uA,t+1(l, j)−uA,t+1(l, k))(uB,t+1(l, j)−uB,t+1(l, k))>0 or ∣uA,t+1(l, j)−uA,t+1(l, k)∣+∣uB,t+1(l, j)−uB,t+1(l, k)∣=0 holds for any l,j, k∈{0,1,2,…}, then uA,t+1 and uB,t+1 are said to be isotonically transformable at stage t+1, denoted as uA,t+1 ◁▷uB,t+1.Suppose the stopping times corresponding to the type I, II, III and IV focus points with uA,t+1and uB,t+1t(t=0,…,m−1) areTiA1∗(m),TiA2∗(m),TiA3∗(m),TiA4∗(m),TiB1∗(m),TiB2∗(m),TiB3∗(m)andTiB4∗(m), respectively. If ∀t∈{0,…,m−1}, uA,t+1◁▷uB,t+1holds, then we haveTiA1∗(m)=TiB1∗(m),TiA2∗(m)=TiB2∗(m),TiA3∗(m)=TiB3∗(m)andTiA4∗(m)=TiB4∗(m).It is trivial to prove Proposition 10 because if ∀t∈{0,…,m−1}, uA,t+1◁▷ uB,t+1 holds then the type I, II, III and IV focus points with uA,t+1 will remain the same as the focus points with uB,t+1 at any stage t+1(t=0,…,m−1).□Suppose in a possibilistic time-invariant system there are two possibilistic transition matrices, [πA(l, j)] and [πB(l, j)]. If (πA(l, j)−πA(l, k))(πB(l, j)−πB(l, k))>0 or ∣πA(l, j)−πA(l, k)∣+∣πB(l, j)−πB(l, k)∣=0 holds for any l, j, k∈{0,1,2,…}, then [πA(l, j)] and [πB(l, j)] are said to be isotonically transformable, denoted as [πB(l, j)]◁▷[πA(l, j)].Suppose the stopping times corresponding to the type V, VI, VII and VIII focus points under [πA(l, j)] and [πB(l, j)] areTiA5∗(m),TiA6∗(m),TiA7∗(m),TiA8∗(m),TiB5∗(m),TiB6∗(m),TiB7∗(m)andTiB8∗(m), respectively. If [πA(l, j)]◁▷[πB(l, j)], then we haveTiA5∗(m)=TiB5∗(m),TiA6∗(m)=TiB6∗(m),TiA7∗(m)=TiB7∗(m)andTiA8∗(m)=TiB8∗(m).SupposeTi9∗(m),Ti10∗(m),Ti11∗(m)andTi12∗(m)are the stopping times corresponding to the type IX, X, XI and XII focus points, respectively. We have(1)Ti9∗(m)⩾Ti11∗(m);Ti10∗(m)⩽Ti12∗(m)if X10(a)∩X12(a)=∅ holds at the last decision stage where a represents the alternative “continuing”.(1)Due to the possibilistic time-invariant system, the states and the possibilistic transition matrix remain the same at all stages. Let us first consider the decision at the last decision stage m−1. For any state at stage m−1, say l, suppose a decision maker chooses “continuing”. Based on Theorem 1, we knowv(x9∗(a),a)⩾v(x11∗(a),a)wherev(x9∗(a),a)andv(x11∗(a),a)are the net rewards for “continuing” from the state l at stage m−1 corresponding to the type IX and XI focus points, respectively. Then,max{v(x9∗(a),a),rl}and max{v(x11∗(a),a), rl} become the rewards for reaching the state l at stage m−1 corresponding to the type IX and XI focus points, respectively. Obviously,max{v(x9∗(a),a),rl}⩾max{v(x11∗(a),a), rl}. For any state at stage m−2, say k, suppose that a decision maker chooses “continuing”. It follows from Theorem 3(2) thatv(x9∗(a),a)⩾v(x11∗(a),a)still holds.v(x9∗(a),a)andv(x11∗(a),a)are the net rewards for “continuing” from the state k at stage m−2.max{v(x9∗(a),a), rk} and max{v(x11∗(a),a), rk} become the rewards for arriving at the state k at stage m−2 corresponding to the type IX and XI focus points, respectively. We can repeat this roll-back procedure until getting to the state i at the initial stage. It means that at any stage the reward of continuing from any state corresponding to the type IX focus point is not smaller than the one corresponding to the type XI focus point. Considering (75), we knowTi9∗(m)⩾Ti11∗(m).For any state at stage m−1, say l, suppose that a decision maker chooses “continuing”. If X10(a)∩X12(a)=∅ holds at this stage, it follows from Theorem 2 that we havev(x10∗(a),a)⩽v(x12∗(a),a)wherev(x10∗(a),a)andv(x12∗(a),a)are the net rewards for “continuing” from the state l at stage m−1. Thenmax{v(x10∗(a),a),rl}andmax{v(x12∗(a),a),rl}become the rewards for reaching the state l at stage m−1 corresponding to the type X and XII focus points, respectively. Considering Theorem 4(2) and referring to the proof of Theorem 12(1), we haveTi10∗(m)⩽Ti12∗(m). □

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this research, a general approach to multistage one-shot decision making is proposed with the one-shot decision theory. At each stage a decision maker chooses one state (focus point) amongst all states according to his/her attitude about satisfaction and possibility. The optimality equation in multistage one-shot decision problems is given. Comparing with the optimality equation in stochastic dynamic programming problems, the payoff associated with the focus points in multistage one-shot decision problems takes the place of the expected payoff in stochastic dynamic programming problems. The sequence of optimal decisions is determined by the proposed backward induction. Because one and only one state occurs while making a decision at each stage, the obtained sequence of optimal decisions is reasonable for making a decision in multistage one-shot decision problems. Based on the twelve types of focus points, we obtain twelve kinds of optimal decision paths to show which scenario at each stage is taken into account and why such a series of decisions is obtained for the twelve types of decision makers. Our research is the first in dealing with the optimal stopping problem in possibilistic dynamic systems. We examine the optimal stopping problem in the possibilistic time-invariant system. The one-step look-ahead rule in the one-shot optimal stopping problem is proposed. How stopping times vary between different types of focus points and are influenced by the changes of possibility distributions and satisfaction functions is theoretically analyzed. The proposed approach is a fundamental alternative for multistage decision making under uncertainty because it is scenario-based instead of lottery-based as in the other existing methods. The research on multistage one-shot decision analysis is at an early stage. Many further researches can be done from theoretical and applied aspects. This research provides the theoretical base for the further research on multistage one-shot decision problems, which are commonly encountered in business, economics, and social systems.
