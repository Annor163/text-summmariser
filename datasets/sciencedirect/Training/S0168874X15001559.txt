An elastic–viscoplastic implicit integration algorithm applicable to both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states is developed for a general class of combined nonlinear kinematic–isotropic hardening models. The algorithm is based on an elastic–plastic algorithm developed by the authors and accordingly has a simple mode patch that makes the algorithm applicable to both the stress states.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The implicit integration of stress and the algorithmic expression of tangent stiffness are necessary to implement an elastic–(visco)plastic constitutive model in the implicit method of finite element analysis [1–3]. For plane stress states, these need to satisfy the condition that the out-of-plane components of stress are zero. Because of this condition, named the plane stress constraint, particular schemes have been developed for plane stress elastic–(visco)plastic finite element analysis [3]. An elegant scheme is that based on plane stress-projected constitutive models, which include only in-plane stress and strain components to satisfy the plane stress constraint [2,3]. This scheme was originally proposed for the von Mises isotropic hardening model of plasticity by Simo and Taylor [4] and Jetteur [5]. For complex constitutive models, however, it may not be easy or feasible to derive plane stress-projected models, and in such cases, it is recommended to use other schemes [3].Ohno et al. [6] developed an elastic–plastic implicit integration algorithm applicable to both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states for a general class of combined nonlinear kinematic–isotropic hardening models. The algorithm was first built for three-dimensional stress states in a general manner using the return mapping procedure and Newton-Raphson method. The plane stress constraint was then incorporated into the Newton-Raphson iteration loop derived for three-dimensional stress states. The resulting algorithm had a simple mode patch that made the algorithm applicable to both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states. The developed algorithm was specified by assuming an advanced evolution model of multiple back stresses. It was demonstrated that the algorithm provided the quadratic convergence of iterations for the implicit stress integration in plane stress, shell, and brick elements. It was also demonstrated that the algorithm was stable even for large increments.The constitutive modeling of viscoplasticity presumes a viscoplastic equation that represents viscoplastic strain rate as a function of stress and internal variables [7,8]. For a sophisticated elastic–viscoplastic model, therefore, a nonlinear system of equations concerning stress and internal variables is in general solved iteratively for implicit stress integration [3,9].11Hartmann et al. [10] showed that a nonlinear system of equations reduces to a scalar equation for an elastic–viscoplastic constitutive model with multiple back stresses obeying the evolution model of Armstrong and Frederick [11]. Kobayashi et al. [12] showed that a nonlinear system of equations reduces to two scalar equations for a non-unified time-dependent constitutive model with multiple back stresses obeying a general class of evolution models. One of these two scalar equations was derived by Kang [13] for implementing an elastic–viscoplastic constitutive model based on the back stress evolution model of Abdel-Karim and Ohno [14].This suggests that the elastic–plastic implicit integration algorithm of Ohno et al. [6] needs to be rebuilt in the presence of viscoplasticity instead of plasticity. It is noted that the so-called elastic trial stress is usually considered to be the initial value of stress for iteratively solving a nonlinear system of equations for elastic–viscoplastic implicit integration [3]. However, it is not mandatory to choose the elastic trial stress as the initial value [9]. It is, in general, worthwhile investigating the influence of initial values on the convergence of iterations in solving a nonlinear system of equations [15].In this study, an elastic–viscoplastic implicit integration algorithm is developed based on the elastic–plastic algorithm of Ohno et al. [6]. A general class of combined nonlinear kinematic–isotropic hardening models of viscoplasticity is considered. First, the algorithm is built to iteratively solve a nonlinear system of equations concerning stress and internal variables in three-dimensional stress states. Second, a mode patch is introduced to make the algorithm applicable to both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states. Third, the algorithm is specified by assuming advanced evolution models of multiple back stresses. Finally, the developed algorithm is verified by performing numerical tests using plane stress, shell, and brick elements. In the numerical tests, an elastic trial stress and an elastic–viscoplastic trial stress based on linear kinematic hardening are examined to provide the initial value to start the Newton-Raphson iteration in the algorithm. It is shown that the elastic–viscoplastic trial stress enable the Newton-Raphson quadratic convergence to occur much earlier than the elastic trial stress.Throughout this paper,IandOindicate the fourth-rank unit and null tensors, while 1 and 0 signify the second-rank unit and null tensors;IDdenotes the deviatoric operator defined asID=I−(1/3)1⊗1. Moreover, a superposed dot indicates differentiation with respect to timet, a colon stands for an inner product between tensors (e.g.,σ:ε=σijεijandD:ε=Dijklεkl), and the symbol‖‖denotes the Euclidean norm of second-rank tensors (e.g.,‖σ‖=(σ:σ)1/2).In this study, elastic–viscoplastic materials with initial isotropy are considered under isothermal conditions. We assume that the strainεis small and is additively decomposed into the elastic partεeobeying isotropic Hooke’s law and the viscoplastic partεvpassociated with combined kinematic–isotropic hardening. We thus consider(1)ε=εe+εvp,(2)σ=De:εe,(3)ε̇vp=32g(y¯,p)yy¯,(4)ṗ=23‖ε̇vp‖,(5)y=s−a,(6)y¯=32‖y‖,whereσdenotes the stress tensor,Dethe isotropic elastic stiffness tensor,g(y¯,p)a viscoplastic function,ythe effective stress,sthe deviatoric part ofσ,athe deviatoric back stress, andpthe accumulated viscoplastic strain.We assume thatais decomposed into several parts [16,17]:(7)a=∑i=1Ma(i),whereMdenotes the number of multiple back stresses. We further assume that eacha(i)evolves as(8)ȧ(i)=f(i)(a(i),p,ε̇vp),wheref(i)is a material function.Let us consider the loading interval between two deformed statesnandn+1, in which the constitutive variables have their values indicated by subscriptsnandn+1. We use a prefixΔto signify the changes in constitutive variables in this loading interval. The backward Euler method then allows Eqs. (1)–(8) to be discretized as(9)σn+1=De:(εn+1−εn+1vp),(10)εn+1=εn+Δεn+1,(11)εn+1vp=εnvp+Δεn+1vp,(12)Δεn+1vp=32Δpn+1yn+1y¯n+1,(13)Δpn+1=g(y¯n+1,pn+Δpn+1)Δtn+1,(14)yn+1=sn+1−an+1,(15)y¯n+1=32‖yn+1‖,(16)an+1=∑i=1Man+1(i),(17)an+1(i)=an(i)+f(i)(an+1(i),pn+1,Δεn+1vp).This section describes an implicit stress integration algorithm valid for the constitutive relations given in Section 2. The algorithm is first built in a general manner in three-dimensional states. The plane stress constraint is then incorporated in the algorithm so that the algorithm is also applicable to plane stress states, as developed in [6].The problem considered here is stated as follows. GivenΔεn+1andΔtn+1in addition to all constitutive variables in the deformed staten, findσn+1that satisfies the discretized constitutive relations (9)–(17).Substituting Eqs. (10) and (11) into Eq. (9) provides(18)σn+1=σn+1ET−De:Δεn+1vp,whereσn+1ETdenotes the elastic trial stress expressed as [1–3](19)σn+1ET=De:(εn+Δεn+1−εnvp).Taking the deviatoric part of Eq. (18) and using Eqs. (14) and (16), we have(20)yn+1=sn+1ET−DeD:Δεn+1vp−∑i=1Man+1(i),wheresn+1ETis the deviatoric part ofσn+1ET, and(21)DeD=ID:De.The Newton-Raphson method is used to solve Eqs. (12), (13), (17) and (20) for findingσn+1under the condition thatΔεn+1andΔtn+1are given. Letdyn+1,dΔεn+1vp, anddan+1(i)be the corrections ofyn+1,Δεn+1vp, andan+1(i)in the Newton-Raphson iteration. Eq. (20) then gives(22)yn+1+dyn+1=sn+1ET−DeD:(Δεn+1vp+dΔεn+1vp)−∑i=1M(an+1(i)+dan+1(i)).Eqs. (12) and (13) and Eq. (17) are, respectively, used to representdΔεn+1vpanddan+1(i)in the following forms (see Sections 6 and 7):(23)dΔεn+1vp=Vn+1:dyn+1,(24)dan+1(i)=Hn+1(i):dΔεn+1vp.Substituting Eqs. (23) and (24) into Eq. (22) and using Eq. (16), we obtain(25)[I+(DeD+Hn+1):Vn+1]:dyn+1=sn+1ET−DeD:Δεn+1vp−an+1−yn+1,where(26)Hn+1=∑i=1MHn+1(i).Eq. (25) is solved fordyn+1to updateyn+1toyn+1+dyn+1. Ifdyn+1satisfies a convergence condition,yn+1is judged to be determined. Eqs. (12) and (13) then provideΔεn+1vp, and consequently,σn+1is obtained using Eq. (18). A computation sequence for this iterative procedure will be shown shortly.Let us consider a thin plate element in plane stress states, for which the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) are adopted with the z-axis oriented in the direction normal to the plate element. We then have(27)σzz=0,σzx=σzy=0,(28)εzz≠0,γzx=γzy=0,whereγij(i≠j) indicates the engineering shear strain. Eqs. (27) and (28) allow all tensors to reduce to their subparts in which the out-of-plane shear components are excluded; for example,Deis expressed in the following form using the Voigt notation:(29)De=[DxxxxeDxxyyeDxxzze0DyyxxeDyyyyeDyyzze0DzzxxeDzzyyeDzzzze0000Dxyxye].The implicit integration problem for plane stress states is stated as follows. GivenΔεn+1andΔtn+1, except(Δεzz)n+1, in addition to all constitutive variables in the deformed staten, findσn+1that satisfies the discretized constitutive relations (9)–(17) and the plane stress constraint (27). Because this constraint requires(σzz)n+1=0, Eqs. (9)–(11) provide(30)(Δεzz)n+1=−1Dzzzze[D˜ezz:(εn−εnvp−Δεn+1vp)+Dzzxxe(Δεxx)n+1+Dzzyye(Δεyy)n+1],whereD˜ezzis defined such thatD˜ijezz=Dzzije. In the above equation,(Δεxx)n+1and(Δεyy)n+1are given to findσn+1. It is thus seen that, for the Newton-Raphson iteration in plane stress states, the correctiondΔεn+1vpinduces the correction of(Δεzz)n+1as(31)d(Δεzz)n+1=1DzzzzeD˜ezz:dΔεn+1vp.As seen from Eq. (19), the above correction then causes(32)dσn+1ET=De:G:dΔεn+1vp,where G is defined in the following form using the Voigt notation:(33)G=1Dzzzze[00000000DzzxxeDzzyyeDzzzze00000].Therefore, for plane stress states, Eq. (22) needs to be modified with the deviatoric partdsn+1ETofdσn+1ET:(34)yn+1+dyn+1=sn+1ET+dsn+1ET−DeD:(Δεn+1vp+dΔεn+1vp)−∑i=1M(an+1(i)+dan+1(i)).Substituting Eqs. (23), (24), and (32) into the above equation, and using Eqs. (16), (21), and (26), we obtain(35)[I+(DeD:(I−G)+Hn+1):Vn+1]:dyn+1=sn+1ET−DeD:Δεn+1vp−an+1−yn+1.Except for G, Eq. (35) has the same form as Eq. (25), which is solved fordyn+1to updateyn+1toyn+1+dyn+1. This means that the three-dimensional implicit integration algorithm based on Eq. (25) becomes applicable to plane stress states if Eq. (25) is simply amended with G as in Eq. (35). In other words, G in Eq. (35) plays the role of a mode patch for Eq. (25) to be applicable to plane stress states. A computation sequence to iteratively determineyn+1for findingσn+1is shown inTable 1, in whichccvgis a constant to check for convergence. This iteration needs to assume the initial value ofyn+1(Step 5 in Table 1). Two possible initial values ofyn+1are given in Section 8.In this section, an expression for the algorithmic tangent stiffnessdσn+1/dΔεn+1is first derived for three-dimensional stress states, and is subsequently reduced for plane stress states.Under the assumption that all constitutive variables are known for the deformed state n, let us differentiate Eqs. (9)–(11) to obtain(36)dσn+1=De:(dΔεn+1−dΔεn+1vp).Taking the deviatoric part of the above equation gives(37)dsn+1=DeD:(dΔεn+1−dΔεn+1vp).Using Eqs. (14), (16) and (23),dΔεn+1vpis expressed as(38)dΔεn+1vp=Vn+1:(dsn+1−∑i=1Mdan+1(i)).Substituting Eqs. (24) and (37) into Eq. (38), and using Eq. (26), we then obtain(39)dΔεn+1vp=(Mn+1+Vn+1:DeD)−1:Vn+1:DeD:dΔεn+1,where(40)Mn+1=I+Vn+1:Hn+1.Eqs. (36) and (39) then provide(41)dσn+1=Dn+1:dΔεn+1,i.e.,dσn+1dΔεn+1=Dn+1,where(42)Dn+1=De:[I−(Mn+1+Vn+1:DeD)−1:Vn+1:DeD].Let us consider again the thin plate element satisfying Eqs. (27) and (28). Because the out-of-plane shear components ofdσn+1anddΔεn+1vanish in this plate element, Eq. (41)1 has the following component expression using the Voigt notation:(43)[dσxxdσyydσzzdσxy]n+1=[DxxxxDxxyyDxxzzDxxxyDyyxxDyyyyDyyzzDyyxyDzzxxDzzyyDzzzzDzzxyDxyxxDxyyyDxyzzDxyxy]n+1[dΔεxxdΔεyydΔεzzdΔγxy]n+1.Here,(dΔεzz)n+1is eliminated using(dσzz)n+1=0as a consequence of Eq. (27)1. Eq. (43) thus provides the in-plane algorithmic tangent stiffnessdσn+1in/dΔεn+1inexpressed as(44)dσn+1indΔεn+1in=[DxxxxDxxyyDxxxyDyyxxDyyyyDyyxyDxyxxDxyyyDxyxy]n+1−1(Dzzzz)n+1[DxxzzDyyzzDxyzz]n+1[DzzxxDzzyyDzzxy]n+1T,whereσinandεindenote the in-plane subparts ofσandε, and the superscript T indicates the transpose.The implicit stress integration and the algorithmic tangent stiffness shown in Sections 4 and 5 require the specification ofVn+1andHn+1(i)introduced in Eqs. (23) and (24). In this section, an expression forVn+1is derived from Eqs. (12) and (13).Differentiating Eqs. (12) and (13) gives(45)dΔεn+1vp=32(dΔpn+1yn+1y¯n+1−Δpn+1yn+1y¯n+12dy¯n+1+Δpn+1dyn+1y¯n+1),(46)dΔpn+1=(∂gn+1∂y¯n+1dy¯n+1+∂gn+1∂Δpn+1dΔpn+1)Δtn+1,wheregn+1=g(y¯n+1,pn+Δpn+1). Here, using Eq. (15),dy¯n+1is expressed as(47)dy¯n+1=32nn+1:dyn+1,where(48)nn+1=32yn+1y¯n+1.Incidentally, Eqs. (45), (47), and (48) provide another expression fordΔpn+1:(49)dΔpn+1=23nn+1:dΔεn+1p.Using Eqs. (46) and (47), Eq. (45) is rewritten as(50)dΔεn+1vp=32[(dΔpn+1dy¯n+1−Δpn+1y¯n+1)nn+1⊗nn+1+Δpn+1y¯n+1I]:dyn+1,where(51)dΔpn+1dy¯n+1=(1−∂gn+1∂Δpn+1Δtn+1)−1∂gn+1∂y¯n+1Δtn+1.Therefore,Vn+1in Eq. (23) is represented as(52)Vn+1=32[(dΔpn+1dy¯n+1−Δpn+1y¯n+1)nn+1⊗nn+1+Δpn+1y¯n+1I].Eq. (52) was derived for a non-unified time-dependent constitutive model by Kobayashi et al. [12].Here, two examples are given forHn+1(i)in Eq. (24) by assuming the evolution models of back stress proposed by Armstrong and Frederick [11] and Ohno and Wang [26]. For the two models, let us assume that eacha(i)in Eq. (7) is represented as(53)a(i)=h(i)(p)b(i),whereh(i)(p)represents the effect of cyclic hardening on the evolution of back stress, andb(i)is a non-dimensional back stress.For the loading interval betweennandn+1, we then have(54)an+1(i)=h(i)(pn+1)bn+1(i),(55)dan+1(i)=dhn+1(i)dΔpn+1dΔpn+1bn+1(i)+hn+1(i)dbn+1(i),wherehn+1(i)=h(i)(pn+Δpn+1). Hence, using Eq. (49),Hn+1(i)in Eq. (24) is expressed as(56)Hn+1(i)=23dhn+1(i)dΔpn+1bn+1(i)⊗nn+1+hn+1(i)H^n+1(i),whereH^n+1(i)relatesdbn+1(i)anddΔεn+1vpas(57)dbn+1(i)=H^n+1(i):dΔεn+1vp.Consequently, the implicit integration algorithm in Table 1 is specified as shown inTable 2.The dynamic recovery of back stress is considered in the nonlinear kinematic hardening model of Armstrong and Frederick [11], which is now a standard model available in commercial finite element software.22Implementation of the AF model in finite element methods has been investigated in e.g. [10,18–20].According to this model, the evolution equation ofb(i)is written as(58)ḃ(i)=23ε̇vp−ζ(i)b(i)ṗ,whereζ(i)is a material parameter for the dynamic recovery ofb(i). The above equation is discretized as(59)Δbn+1(i)=23Δεn+1vp−ζ(i)bn+1(i)Δpn+1.Consequently,bn+1(i)in Eq. (54) andH^n+1(i)in Eq. (56) are represented as [6,21](60)bn+1(i)=11+ζ(i)Δpn+1(bn(i)+23Δεn+1vp).(61)H^n+1(i)=11+ζ(i)Δpn+1(23I−23ζ(i)bn+1(i)⊗nn+1).The AF model is well-known but has the drawback of over-predicting ratcheting and cyclic stress relaxation [22–24]. This drawback can be overcome to a considerable extent by non-linearizing the dynamic recovery of back stress e.g., [25–28]. According to Ohno and Wang [26], the evolution equation ofb(i)is written as(62)ḃ(i)=23ε̇vp−ζ(i)(ζ(i)b¯(i))k(i)〈ε̇vp:b(i)b¯(i)〉b(i),whereζ(i)andk(i)are material parameters,〈〉indicates Macaulay’s brackets, and(63)b¯(i)=32‖b(i)‖.Eq. (62) is discretized as(64)Δbn+1(i)=23Δεn+1vp−ζ(i)(ζ(i)b¯n+1(i))k(i)〈Δεn+1vp:bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)〉bn+1(i).Hence,bn+1(i)in Eq. (54) andH^n+1(i)in Eq. (56) are represented as (Appendix A)(65)bn+1(i)=θn+1(i)(bn(i)+23Δεn+1vp),(66)H^n+1(i)=23θn+1(i)I−Cn+1(i)(ϕn+1(i)bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)⊗bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)+23θn+1(i)bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)⊗Δεn+1vp),whereθn+1(i),Cn+1(i)andϕn+1(i)are given in Appendix A.It is necessary to assume the initial value ofyn+1before starting the Newton-Raphson iteration in the implicit stress integration algorithm shown in Section 4 (Tables 1 and 2). This section describes two possible initial values ofyn+1.The elastic trial stressσn+1ETdefined as Eq. (19) can be used as the initial stress for iteratively solving the nonlinear system of discretized elastic–viscoplastic constitutive equations given in Section 3. This leads to the assumption that the following elastic trial effective stress is the initial value ofyn+1:(67)yn+1ET=sn+1ET−an,where(68)an=∑i=1Man(i).To show another initial value ofyn+1, let us suppose that only linear kinematic hardening occurs as strain hardening fromnton+1. This linear hardening means that neither the dynamic recovery of back stress nor isotropic hardening occurs in the loading interval fromnton+1. Both the AF and OW models then reduce to(69)an+1=an+23hnΔεn+1vp,hn=∑i=1Mh(i)(pn).In addition, Eqs. (12) and (13) become(70)Δεn+1vp=32g(y¯n+1,pn)Δtn+1yn+1y¯n+1.Substituting Eqs. (69) and (70) into Eq. (20), using Eq. (67), and noting thatDeD:Δεn+1vp=2GΔεn+1vpfor initially isotropic materials, we obtain(71)[1+(3G+hn)g(y¯n+1EVT,pn)Δtn+1y¯n+1EVT]yn+1EVT=yn+1ET,(72)y¯n+1EVT+(3G+hn)g(y¯n+1EVT,pn)Δtn+1=y¯n+1ET,whereyn+1EVTis the elastic–viscoplastic trial effective stress based on linear kinematic hardening,Gindicates the modulus of shear rigidity, and(73)y¯n+1ET=32‖yn+1ET‖,(74)y¯n+1EVT=32‖yn+1EVT‖.It is noted thatyn+1ETis computed before starting the Newton-Raphson iteration in Tables 1 and 2, and also thatΔtn+1is given for the loading interval fromnton+1. Consequently, by solving Eq. (72) fory¯n+1EVTand then using Eq. (71),yn+1EVTcan be computed to be the initial value ofyn+1for starting the Newton-Raphson iteration in Tables 1 and 2.To verify the implicit integration algorithm and the algorithmic tangent stiffness described in Sections 4 and 5, we performed numerical tests using plane stress, shell, and brick elements. For this purpose, the implicit integration algorithm and the algorithmic tangent stiffness were coded for a user subroutine UMAT of the finite element analysis software Abaqus/Standard. The two trial effective stresses given in Section 8,yn+1ETandyn+1EVT, were incorporated as the initial value ofyn+1for the Newton-Raphson iteration in the implicit integration algorithm. The convergence condition for the iteration in Tables 1 and 2 was set as(75)‖dyn+1‖‖yn+1‖<ccvg=10−8.The implicit integration in this study thus had the numerical accuracy ofccvg=10−8as expressed above irrespective of the initial value ofyn+1if the Newton-Raphson iteration converged.In the UMAT program developed in this study, the viscoplastic functiong(y¯,p)in Eq. (3) was specified as(76)g(y¯,p)=ε̇0(y¯σ0ρ(p))m,whereε̇0,σ0andmare material parameters, andρ(p)is an isotropic hardening function. It was assumed that this isotropic hardening function also affected the evolution of back stress throughh(i)(p)in Eq. (53) as(77)h(i)(p)=h0(i)ρ(p),whereh0(i)is constant.Tables 3 and 4 list the material parameters used in this study for the AF and OW models, respectively. The material parameters in the tables, except for the viscoplastic parameters, are the same as those in [6].The implicit integration algorithm was first examined by performing uniaxial tests using a square plate. Either one four-node plane stress element (CPS4) or one eight-node brick element (C3D8) was used for the square plate.The square plate was subjected to uniaxial tensile loading in the x-direction. The strainεxxwas incrementally increased to 0.01 by takingΔεxx=0.01/Ninc, whereNincindicates the number of increments.Fig. 1a and b depicts the tensile stress–strain relations obtained forNinc=10and 50 atε̇xx=10−3, 10-4 and 10-5s−1 using the AF and OW models. It is seen that, for each set ofNincandε̇xx, the plane stress and brick elements provided the same stress–strain relation for each of the AF and OW models.Fig. 2a and b illustrates the convergence of iterations to determineyn+1atε̇xx=10−3s−1in the last increment under ten increment loading (i.e.,Ninc=10). As shown in the figure, the initial valueyn+1EVTenabled the quadratic convergence to occur much earlier thanyn+1EVin both computations using the plane stress and brick elements. Here, it is noted that whenyn+1EVwas used as the initial value ofyn+1,3/2‖dyn+1‖had about 15MPa initially. This value was several times greater than those based onyn+1EVT, and resulted in a considerable delay in obtaining the quadratic convergence. Thus, especially when the initial valueyn+1EVTwas used, the implicit integration algorithm worked well for both the plane stress and brick elements under in-plane uniaxial tension.The square plate was then subjected to tensile loading followed by strain holding and small cyclic loading alternately (Fig. 3). The number of increments per step,Ninc, was taken to be constant.Fig. 4a and b shows the stress–time relations obtained forNinc=5and 50 using the AF and OW models. It is again seen that, for each value ofNinc, the plane stress and brick elements provided the same relation for each of the AF and OW models. It is further seen that the OW model predicts a much less effect of small cyclic loading on subsequent tensile peak stresses than the AF model. This was owing to the nonlinearity of dynamic recovery introduced in Eq. (62) for the OW model to improve the simulation of ratcheting and cyclic stress relaxation. It is recalled that the AF model has the drawback of over-predicting ratcheting and cyclic stress relaxation [22–24].Fig. 5a and b illustrates the convergence of iterations to determineyn+1in the first increment after starting the first strain holding at t=5.0s in the case ofNinc=5. As shown in the figure, the initial valueyn+1EVTenabled the quadratic convergence to occur considerably earlier thanyn+1ETin both computations using the plane stress and brick elements. Thus, for both the plane stress and brick elements, the implicit integration algorithm had very good performance under strain holding as well as under tensile loading whenyn+1EVTwas used as the initial value ofyn+1for the Newton-Raphson iteration.As a general numerical test, we performed a finite element analysis of a single-hole plate subjected to combined cyclic bending and constant tension. The plate analyzed is illustrated inFig. 6, where the Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z are used. As shown in the figure, the plate was subjected to cyclically varying out-of-plane displacementuyendand constant in-plane tensionσxxendat one end, while the plate was firmly fixed at the opposite end. After increasingσxxendfrom 0 to 5MPa,uyendwas cyclically varied for five cycles between 0 and 3.5mm with a hold time of 10s in each cycle (Fig. 6b). The number of increments per step,Ninc, was taken to be five except for the incipient loading ofσxxendfrom 0 to 5MPa. Half the plate was divided into finite elements using either eight-node doubly curved shell, reduced integration elements (S8R) or 20-node quadratic brick, reduced integration elements (C3D20R), as shown inFig. 7a and b. These two finite element models are referred to as the shell and brick element models from here on.Fig. 8 shows the hysteresis loops ofσxxandεxxobtained at the upper surface nodal points indicated by the symbol × in Fig. 7a and b. As seen in Fig. 8, the shell element model gave almost the same hysteresis loops as the brick element model. This means that the implicit stress integration algorithm described in Table 2 worked well for both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states. It is also seen in Fig. 8 that ratcheting occurred much less noticeably when the OW model was used. This was a consequence of the nonlinearity of dynamic recovery that was introduced in Eq. (62) for the OW model to improve the simulation of ratcheting. It is further seen in the figure that cyclic hardening occurred as a consequence of the isotropic hardening functionρ(p)introduced in Eqs. (76) and (77).Figs. 9 and 10 depict the convergence of local iterations to determineyn+1in the implicit stress integration at nodal points in the increments just before and just after starting the first holding ofuyendat t=1.0s. The results shown in these figures were obtained at the integration points closest to the upper surface nodal points indicated by×in the shell and brick element models in Fig. 7a and b. As observed in Figs. 9 and 10, the quadratic convergence eventually occurred in both computations using the shell and brick element models, though the initial valueyn+1EVTallowed the quadratic convergence to start noticeably earlier thanyn+1ET. This means that the mode patch G in Eq. (35) operated suitably for the implicit stress integration in plane stress states as well as in three-dimensional stress states. Hence, we can say that the implicit stress integration algorithm given in Table 2 is applicable to both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states. We can also say that the implicit integration algorithm can have good performance especially ifyn+1EVTis used as the initial value ofyn+1for the Newton-Raphson iteration in the algorithm.Figs. 11 and 12 show the convergences of global iterations to determine the nodal increments in the shell and brick element models. In the figures, the variations in the maximum residual nodal force and moment are plotted against the number of global iterations in the increments just before and just after starting the first holding ofuyendat t=1.0s. The convergence was judged using the default condition in Abaqus/Standard. It is seen that the quadratic convergence of global iterations was obtained in both computations using the shell and brick element models. The quadratic convergence was owing to the algorithmic tangent stiffness that was shown for plane stress and three-dimensional stress states in Section 5.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, an elastic–viscoplastic implicit integration algorithm applicable to both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states was developed based on the elastic–plastic algorithm of Ohno et al. [6]. A general class of combined nonlinear kinematic–isotropic hardening models of viscoplasticity was considered. First, the algorithm was built to iteratively solve a nonlinear system of equations concerning stress and internal variables in three-dimensional stress states. Second, the plane stress constraint was incorporated into the Newton-Raphson iteration loop derived for three-dimensional stress states. The resulting algorithm has a simple mode patch that makes the algorithm applicable to both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states. Third, the developed algorithm was specified by assuming advanced evolution models of multiple back stresses. An elastic trial effective stress,yn+1ET, and an elastic–viscoplastic trial effective stress based on linear kinematic hardening,yn+1EVT, were examined to provide the initial value of effective stressyn+1for the Newton-Raphson iteration in the algorithm. Finally, the algorithm was coded for a user subroutine UMAT of Abaqus/Standard, and was examined by performing uniaxial and general numerical tests using plane stress, shell, and brick elements. The general numerical test performed was an analysis of a single-hole plate subjected to constant in-plane tension and cyclically varying out-of-plane displacement with a hold time in each cycle. The following were thus demonstrated:•The developed algorithm provided the Newton-Raphson quadratic convergence for the implicit stress integration in both plane stress and three-dimensional stress states.The elastic–viscoplastic initial stressyn+1EVTenabled the Newton-Raphson quadratic convergence to occur much earlier than when using the elastic initial stressyn+1ET.BecauseΔbn+1(i)=bn+1(i)−bn(i), Eq. (64) is rewritten as(A1)bn+1(i)=θn+1(i)(bn(i)+23Δεn+1vp),where(A2)θn+1(i)=[1+ζ(i)(ζ(i)b¯n+1(i))k(i)〈Δλn+1(i)〉]−1,(A3)Δλn+1(i)=Δεn+1vp:bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i).Let us suppose thatΔλn+1(i)≥0. Differentiating Eqs. (A1)–(A3) and (63) then provides(A4)dbn+1(i)=dθn+1(i)θn+1(i)bn+1(i)+23θn+1(i)dΔεn+1vp,(A5)dθn+1(i)(θn+1(i))2=−ωn+1(i)(k(i)db¯n+1(i)b¯n+1(i)Δλn+1(i)+dΔλn+1(i)),(A6)dΔλn+1(i)=dΔεn+1vp:bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)+Δεn+1vp:dbn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)−Δλn+1(i)db¯n+1(i)b¯n+1(i),(A7)db¯n+1(i)b¯n+1(i)=32bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i):dbn+1(i)b¯n+1(i),where(A8)ωn+1(i)=ζ(i)(ζ(i)b¯n+1(i))k(i).Substituting Eqs. (A6) and (A7) along with (A4) into Eq. (A5), and using Eqs. (63) and (A3), we then derive(A9)dθn+1(i)(θn+1(i))2=−ωn+1(i)(k(i)Δλn+1(i)dθn+1(i)θn+1(i)+ϕn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i):dΔεn+1vp+23θn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)Δεn+1vp:dΔεn+1vp),where(A10)ϕn+1(i)=(k(i)−1)Δλn+1(i)θn+1(i)+b¯n+1(i).Eq. (A9), which is valid forΔλn+1(i)≥0, is solved fordθn+1(i)/θn+1(i). WhenΔλn+1(i)<0, Eq. (A2) givesθn+1(i)=1, and hence, we havedθn+1(i)/θn+1(i)=0. Thus,dθn+1(i)/θn+1(i)is expressed as(A11)dθn+1(i)θn+1(i)=−Cn+1(i)(ϕn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i):dΔεn+1vp+23θn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)Δεn+1vp:dΔεn+1vp),where(A12)Cn+1(i)=H(Δλn+1(i))θn+1(i)ωn+1(i)1+k(i)θn+1(i)ωn+1(i)Δλn+1(i).Here,Hindicates Heaviside׳s step function, and it is noted that whenΔλn+1(i)<0we haveCn+1(i)=0becauseH(Δλn+1(i))=0.Consequently, by substituting Eq. (A11) into Eq. (A4),H^n+1(i)in Eq. (57) is obtained as(A13)H^n+1(i)=23θn+1(i)I−Cn+1(i)(ϕn+1(i)bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)⊗bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)+23θn+1(i)bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)⊗Δεn+1vp).Step 11 in Table 2 requires computingbn+1(i)for givenΔεn+1vp. For the AF model,bn+1(i)is computed using Eq. (60). This appendix describes how to computebn+1(i)for the OW model.Eqs. (A1) and (A2) give(B1)[1+ζ(i)(ζ(i)b¯n+1(i))k(i)〈Δλn+1(i)〉]b¯n+1(i)=b¯n+1(i)*,where(B2)b¯n+1(i)*=32‖bn+1(i)*‖,bn+1(i)*=bn(i)+23Δεn+1vp.Here it is noted that Eq. (A1) provides(B3)bn+1(i)b¯n+1(i)=bn+1(i)*b¯n+1(i)*.Substituting Eq. (B3) into Eq. (A3) results in(B4)Δλn+1(i)=Δεn+1vp:bn+1(i)*b¯n+1(i)*.Consequently, ifΔεn+1vpis given, Eq. (B1) with (B4) is solved forb¯n+1(i), and then,bn+1(i)is computed from Eq. (B3).
