@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Traditionally adopted fixed frequency allocation policy is not able to meet the insatiable demand of more spectrum. This leads to the development of cognitive radio (CR) which provides opportunistic access of licensed spectrum to the unlicensed users [1,2]. In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) scheme is introduced to combat the effects of fading, shadowing and the hidden layer problem occur in practical wireless environment [3]. In CSS, the local sensing results of secondary users (SUs) are combined at the fusion centre (FC) by two schemes; Hard decision fusion (HDF) [4,5] and Soft decision fusion (SDF) [6,7]. From the literature studies, it is found that SDF-based CSS schemes give better performance than HDF-based CSS schemes [6,7]. This mainly motivated us to formulate our resource allocation model in SDF-based sensing scheme.Energy-efficient CRN design depends on the system throughput and power consumption by the sensing devices. Meanwhile, the sensing time must be chosen to maintain a trade-off between the spectrum sensing accuracy and system throughput [8]. The optimal power allocation is also necessary to restrict the unnecessary growth of transmission power that may introduce severe interference to the primary user (PU) [9]. Especially, in wireless environment, transmission power degrades with the distance raised to the power of path-loss factor. The reduced weak signal makes the SUs to falsely decide the absence of PU in the desired band and to transmit their data. More SUs lead to more energy consumption. So, exclusion of these shadowed SUs and inclusion of suitable (less spatially-correlated) SUs can improve the detection probability with less power consumption.To preserve energy efficiency (EE), most of the papers in the literature have discussed power allocation algorithms with limited interference to the PU. Wu et al. maximised the EE by jointly optimising the sensing time and power allocation with the constraints of detection parameters and interference to the PU [10]. In [11], the authors proposed a power allocation algorithm by taking sensing error into consideration for OFDM-based cooperative networks. In [12], an energy-efficient model was suggested for multiple amplify-and-forward relays in single source-destination (S-D) CR environment. Here, the authors formulated EE maximization problem as a minimization of total energy consumption under the constraints of false alarm probability, probability of detection, data rate of SUs and minimum interference threshold. A novel iterative algorithm based on parametric transformation method was proposed in [13] for green CR under the constraint of interference to the PU, and was extended for decode-and-forward (DF) relay based green cooperative CR in [14] under both interference and SUs outage constraints. To derive the optimal power allocation strategies over different fading channels, Kang et al. considered the channel state information of PU and maximised the outage capacity at secondary network under the constraints of maximum transmission power from the SUs and outage probability of PU [15]. In [16], EE variation over sensing time was formulated as concave optimization, so golden section search method was employed to find optimal sensing time for maximum EE. Most of the papers are based on HDF-based CSS and do not consider the PU activity during the data transmission period while formulating the interference model.The main objective of this paper is to maximise the EE with optimal sensing time and power allocation with limited interference to the PU and outage of SUs. The main contributions of our work are summarised below.a.Firstly, we develop an interference-aware model considering the exponential transition probabilities of PU during the data transmission period.Secondly, we propose SUs selection algorithm based on Hungarian method to select less spatially-correlated SUs.Thirdly, we formulate this joint optimization using two approaches.•We propose a Novel Iterative Dinkelbach Method (NIDM) algorithm under the constraints of different parameters associated with the EE maximization.At each iteration in NIDM algorithm, the sensing time is found by employing golden section search method for maximum throughput and the sub-problem associated with the power allocation is solved by employing Karush–Kahn–Tucker (KKT) condition on Lagrangian dual problem. Then, the complexity of our proposed algorithm is analysed.Finally, the performance of our proposed scheme is presented and the effect of different system parameters on the simulation results is studied.Table 1summarises the main symbols and notations used in this paper. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the system model and the interference model. The EE maximization problem formulation is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, our proposed algorithms are discussed. We present the simulation results in Section 5 and finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6.In this Section, we discuss the system model of SDF-based CSS scheme along with the frame structure, and provide the interference model to evaluate the total interference possible to the PU during the data transmission period.We consider a CRN consists of K SUs which are uniformly distributed around the centrally located PU from which only M less spatial-correlated SUs are to be selected. They jointly perform spectrum sensing on the entire licensed band. The licensed band is then divided into M number of sub-bands so as to allow each SU to transmit its data separately in one of the sub-bands to its corresponding cognitive destination (CD). Let a CR system consists of Q number of frames each of length T as shown in Fig. 1. Each frame consists of sensing slot of duration τs, reporting slot of durationτr=∑i=1Mriand one data transmission slot of durationT0=T−τr−τs. We assume that τris very less as compared to τsand T0, hence is neglected in further part of the evaluation.All M SUs each with single energy detector (ED) receive PU signal and send their local sensing results to the FC as shown in Fig. 2. If s(k) is the signal from the PU, then the received signal xi(k) at ith SU in kth instant is formulated as two binary hypotheses tests(1)xi(k)={ηi(k),H0s(k)hpsi(k)+ηi(k),H1i=[1,2,….,M]where ηi(k) is the additive noise with zero mean and variance σηi2. The PU signal is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) of zero mean and variance σs2. The propagation channels between the PU and the SUs follow the path-loss and log-normal distributions which is given byhpsi(k)∼(di)−zex. Here, diis the distance between the PU and ith SU, z is the path-loss exponent and x is the Gaussian random variable with mean and variance σ2, whereσ=0.1ln(10)σdBand σdBis the log-normal distribution and its range is 4 ≤ σdB≤ 12. The two hypotheses H0 and H1represent the absence and presence of the PU, respectively. Each SU measures the received power over N samples during the sensing interval and makes the local decision as follows(2)Yi=1N∑k=0N−1|xi(k)|2whereN=τsfsand fsis the sampling frequency. According to the central limit theorem, for large value of N the local test statistic is approximately represented by the Gaussian distribution which is given by [7](3)Yi∼{N(σηi2,σηi4/N),H0N(σηi2(1+γi),σηi4N(1+2γi)),H1where γiis the received SNR at the ith SU and is given byγi=σs2|hpsi|2|σηi|2. If λ denotes the threshold, then the probability of detection and false alarm of the ith SU are given by(4)Pdi(τs)=Pr(Yi>λ|H1)=Q(λ−σηi2(1+γi)σηi21+2γiτsfs)and(5)Pfi(τs)=Pr(Yi≥λ|H0)=Q(λ−σηi2σηi2τsfs)respectively. FC linearly combines the local test statistics with the weight coefficients of SUs to make the global decision statistic YGwhich is expressed as [7](6)YG=∑i=1MwiYiwhere wiis the weight coefficient assigned to ith SU. An external constraint is added to the weight vectorw=[w1,w2,….,wM]Tsuch thatw22=1. The weight vector can be optimised by using MRC [6], EGC [6] and MDC [7]. Here, we considerwi=γi∑i=1Mγi2because of its suitability in low SNR condition [8]. Then, the final decision is evaluated by comparing YGwith the global threshold λgand is expressed as [7](7)Pd(τs)=Q(λg−∑i=1Mσηi2(1+γi)wi∑i=1Mσηi4(1+2γi)wi2τsfs)and(8)Pf(τs)=Q(λg−∑i=1Mσηi2wi∑i=1Mσηi4wi2τsfs)From (7), the corresponding false alarm probability for the given detection probabilityP¯dcan be determined as(9)Pf(τs)=Q[a+bτsfs]where a and b are given bya=Q−1(P¯d)∑i=1Mσηi4(1+2γi)wi2∑i=1Mσηi4wi2andb=∑i=1Mσηi2wiγi∑i=1Mσηi4wi2.The activity of the PU is modelled as an exponentially distributed ON-OFF process which alternates between ON and OFF state. If α and β represent the busy and idle rates, then the probability that the channel is being occupied by the PU isP(H1)=αα+β, and the probability that PU is absent isP(H0)=βα+β. During the data transmission period, interference to the PU may be expected in two possible scenarios. In the first scenario, SUs correctly detect the absence of the PU during sensing period but the PU makes a transition in the data transmission period. In this case, the possibility of PU being present during T0 is given by [17](10)P01(T0)=βα+β(T0+(exp(−(α+β)T0)−1)α+β)Hence, the interference for this OFF state is calculated asIOFF=(1−Pf)P01(T0). In the second scenario, SUs fail to identify the weak PU signal and start transmitting their data. So, the possibility of PU presence during T0 is expressed as [17](11)P11(T0)=T0−αα+β(T0+(exp(−(α+β)T0)−1)α+β)So, the interference in this busy state is determined byION=PmdP11(T0), where Pmddenotes the missed detection probability. The average interference introduced to the PU is defined as the ratio of total interference occurs during T0 with the persistence of PU signal during the entire frame.(12)Itotal=ION+IOFFP(H1)TBased on the FC final decision, there are two possible scenarios when the SUs intend to transmit their data to the CDs. In the first scenario, the PU is correctly detected to be absent in the desired band. So, the channel capacity achieved at ith SU isC0i=log2(1+|hsdi|2PtiN0). Here, hsdiis the Rayleigh-distributed sub-channel gain between the ith SU and its corresponding CD, and is calculated ashsdi∼N(0,1diz). Ptirepresents the transmission power from the ith SU and N0 denotes the noise power. In the second scenario, the PU is active on the licensed band, but the SUs unable to identify the PU signal and start transmitting their data. The capacity achieved in this case is expressed asC1i=log2(1+|hsdi|2Pti|hpdi|2Pp+N0), where Ppis the interference power due to presence of PU received at the secondary network and hpdiis the Rayleigh-distributed sub-channel gain between the PU and ith CD, and is calculated ashpdi∼N(0,1diz). Hence, Ppis given by(13)Pp=P(H1)PmdP(H¯0)σs2whereP(H¯0)denotes the total probability of eventH¯0which is given byP(H¯0)=P(H0)(1−Pf)+P(H1)Pmd.Under these two scenarios, the average throughput achieved at the secondary CR network is [8](14)R(τs,Pt)=∑i=1MR1i(τs,Pt)+∑i=1MR2i(τs,Pt)≈∑i=1MR1i(τs,Pt)where(15)R1i(τs,Pt)=(1−Pf)P(H0)C0iT0T(16)R2i(τs,Pt)=PmdP(H1)C1iT0TFrom (14), it is clear that longer sensing time reduces the data transmission period. If Rthdenotes the minimum achievable data rate of ith SU, then the minimum transmission power from each SU is expressed as(17)Pti≥(2Rth−1)N0|hsdi|2Then, we analyse the overall outage performance to examine the effect of interference on the system throughput. An outage occurs when the channel capacity of the SU falls below the threshold Rth. So, the outage at ith SU is given by(18)Pouti=T0T[P(H0)(1−Pf){1−exp(−γthσsdi2)}+P(H1)Pmd{1−σsdi2σpdi2γpγth+σsdi2exp(−γthσsdi2)}]whereγp=Pp/N0andγth=(2Rth−1)N0/Pti. Then the outage probability constraint of ith SU is expressed as(19)Pouti≤Γthwhere Γthis the outage threshold. The main objective of this paper is to maximise EE by jointly optimising the sensing time and power allocationPt=[Pt1,Pt2,……,PtM]. The first sub-optimization problem is the throughput maximization which is formulated as(20)maximize:R(τs)(20a)subjectto:Pd≥P¯d(20b):0≤τs≤T(20c):(17)and(19)For any value of Pt,R(τs) is a unimodal function of τs, it increases monotonically from 0 ≤ τs< τs* and decreases from τs* < τs≤ T. So, there exist a unique value of sensing time τs* at which R(τs) is maximum.Theorem 1R(τs) is a concave function of τs, where τs* gives the maximum average throughput.ProofProof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix A.So, it is proved that R(τs) is a unimodal function in the range 0 ≤ τs≤ T. Hence, golden section search method is employed to get optimal sensing time for maximum throughput [18].The second optimization problem is to maximise EE. In the CRNs, essentially the power is consumed during the spectrum sensing and data transmission, and it is obvious that sensing power is less than the data transmission power. So, the total power consumption in the CR system is given by (neglecting the circuit power consumption)(21)PT(τs,Pt)=τsMPs+T0P(H¯0)∑i=1MPtiwhere Psis the sensing power and assumed to be same for all the SUs. Then, EE (bit/s/joule) of the CRNs is defined as the ratio of the average throughput (14) and the total power consumption by the secondary network (21) which is expressed as(22)EE(τs,Pt)=R(τs,Pt)PT(τs,Pt)The EE maximization problem is formulated under the following constraints(23)Maximizeτs,PtR(τs,Pt)PT(τs,Pt)(23a)Subjectto:Ptmax−∑i=1MPti≥0(23b):Ith−Itotal∑i=1M|hspi|2Pti≥0(23c):Γth−Pouti≥0(23d):C0i≥Rth(23e):Pti≥(2Rth−1)N0|hsdi|2(23f):0≤τs≤TwherePt=[Pt1,Pt2,……,PtM]. Ptmaxis the maximum allowable transmission power from the SUs and Ithrepresents the interference power threshold. Represents the interference power threshold. The total interference power below Ithwill not affect the legitimate PU. Here, hspiis the sub-channel gain between the ith SU and the PU.In this Section, we develop a less spatially-correlated SUs selection algorithm to select M SUs out of the total K SUs. Then, the joint optimization of sensing time and transmission power is obtained through our proposed NIDM algorithm.Shadowing produces spatially weak and correlated signals on the secondary networks. It has already been proved that less number of SUs in a large area is more effective than more numbers of SUs in a dense area [19]. These uncorrelated SUs can be selected adaptively [20] or from its normalised covariance matrix of received signal [21]. Let K be the total number of SUs present in a CRN, then the element in the correlation matrix E is expressed as [22](24)Ei,j=e−ɛdijwhere, dijrepresents the distance between the ith and the jth SU. ɛ is an environmental constant. ɛ ≈ 0.1209/m and ɛ ≈ 0.002/m in the urban environment and in the suburban environment, respectively. To avoid the effect of the spatial correlation, we propose a SUs selection algorithm which is based on Hungarian method [23]. The steps describing the algorithm are given as follows.We adopt the nonlinear fractional or parametric programming to solve the objective function (23). As per parametric programming, if p(x) and q(x) are continuous and real valued functions andxϵS, where S is a subset, then,maxxϵS{p(x)q(x)}can be transformed tomaxxϵS{p(x)−uq(x)}. This transformation relies on the following theorem.Theorem 2If S is the feasible set then there exists a optimal objective function such that(25)u*=p(x*)q(x*)=maxxϵS{p(x)q(x)}ProofProof of Theorem 2 is given in [24].As per this theorem, our optimization problem is formulated as;u*=R(τs*,Pt*)PT(τs*,Pt*)=maxxϵS{R(τs,Pt)PT(τs,Pt)}andmax{R(τs,Pt)−u*PT(τs,Pt)}=R(τs*,Pt*)−u*PT(τs*,Pt*)=0. Here, τs* and Pt* represent the optimal sensing time and optimal power allocation, respectively. Our proposed NIDM algorithm presents the steps for joint optimization of sensing time and power allocation with suitable selection of SUs from Algorithm 1.According to Algorithm 2, at each iteration iter, Pt(iter) is calculated from the sub-problems associated with the convex optimization which is given in the next sub-section. Then, for the given transmission power, sensing time is found out for maximum (20) by using golden section search method. Algorithm 2 is terminated when u(iter) converges. In Appendix B, we prove the convergence of such type of fractional programming transformation algorithm.In (22), R(τs, Pt) is a concave and PT(τs, Pt) is an affine function of SUs transmission power. Also the constraints given in (23a–23f) are either linear or convex. Hence, for the given τs, the optimal power allocation problem{R(τs,Pt)−u(iter)PT(τs,Pt)}can be formulated using the convex theory subject to the (23a), (23b) and (23d) constraints. Then, this sub-optimization problem is solved by Lagrangian duality theorem which is expressed as(27)L(η,μ,ϑ)=C′∑i=1Mlog2(1+|hsdi|2PtiN0)−u(iter)(MτsPs+T0P(H¯0)∑i=1MPti)+η(Ptmax−∑i=1MPti)+μ(Ith−Itotal∑i=1M|hspi|2Pti)+ϑi(log2(1+ψiPti)−Rth)Subject to(27a):Ptmax−∑i=1MPti≥0(27b):Ith−Itotal∑i=1M|hspi|2Pti≥0(27c):log2(1+ψiPti)−Rth≥0where η, μ andϑ=[ϑ1,ϑ2,……,ϑM]are the non-negative Lagrangian multipliers,ψi=|hsdi|2N0andC′=(1−Pf)P(H0)T0T. In each iteration iter of Algorithm 2, the Lagrangian dual problem is solved such thatminη,μ,ϑmaxτs,PtL(η,μ,ϑ).Then by applying KKT condition to this dual problem we have [25](28)C′ψi(1+ψiPti)(ln2)−u(iter)T0P(H¯0)−η−μItotal∑i=1M|hspi|2+ϑiC0i′=0(28a)η(Ptmax−∑i=1MPti)=0(28b)μ(Ith−Itotal∑i=1M|hspi|2Pti)=0(28c)ϑi(log2(1+ψiPti)−Rth)=0whereC0i′=ψi(1+ψiPti)ln2. It is clearly observed from (28a), (28b) and (28c) that each condition generates two cases; either the dual variable is zero or the corresponding constraint is zero. So, we have summarised the possibilities into four cases, and accordingly calculate Pt(iter) for the current iteration iter of Algorithm 2.Case-1: η=µ =0 andϑi=0for alliϵM.So, (28) reduces to(29)C′ψi(1+ψiPti)(ln2)−u(iter)T0P(H¯0)=0(29a)Subjectto:Ptmax−∑i=1MPti≥0(29b):Ith−Itotal∑i=1M|hspi|2Pti≥0(29c)log2(1+ψiPti)−Rth≥0The power solution of ith SU from (29) is obtained by water filling solution and is expressed as(30)Pti1=[C′u(iter)T0P(H¯0)ln2−1ψi]+where[.]+=max[0,.].Then, substituting the value of (30) in (29a), (29b) and (29c), following three conditions (31a), (31b) and (31c) are evaluated, respectively which are as follows(31a)C′u(iter)T0P(H¯0)ln2≤PtmaxM+1M∑i=1M1ψi(31b)C′u(iter)T0P(H¯0)ln2≤I*+∑i=1M|hspi|2ψi∑i=1M|hspi|2(31c)C′u(iter)T0P(H¯0)ln2≥(2Rth)ψiwhereI*=Ith/Itotal. If (31a), (31b) and (31c) are satisfied, then (30) is the power allocation solution.Case-2:η≠0,μ=0andϑi=0for alliϵM. Similar to the Case-1, (28) reduces to(32)C′ψi(1+ψiPti)(ln2)−u(iter)T0P(H¯0)−η=0(32a)Subjectto:∑i=1MPti=Ptmax(32b):(29b)and(29c)In this case, the optimal solution for power allocation is obtained as(33)Pti2=[C′(η+u(iter)T0P(H¯0))(ln2)−1ψi]+So, (31b) and (31c) are satisfied, and (31a) is reduced to equality constraint which is given by(34)C′u(iter)T0P(H¯0)ln2=PtmaxM+1M∑i=1M1ψiThe water filling solution in (33) consists of the dual variable η in the denominator which is updated by sub-gradient method as per the following expression [25](35)η(it+1)=[η(it)−Y(it)(Ptmax−∑i=1MPti)]+where Y(it) is non-negative step size for the current iteration it and is set at1/it. So, Y(it) decreases with the number of iteration and η converges to its optimal value when Y(it) is sufficiently small.Case-3:η=0,μ≠0,ϑi=0for alliϵM. Then the KKT condition given in (28) is reduced to(36)C′ψi(1+ψiPti)(ln2)−u(iter)T0P(H¯0)−μItotal∑i=1M|hspi|2=0Subject to(36a):(29a)and(29c)(36b):Ith=Itotal∑i=1M|hspi|2PtiAfter solving (36), the power allocation solution is given by(37)Pti3=[C′(u(iter)T0P(H¯0)+μItotal∑i=1M|hspi|2)ln2−1ψi]+With the conditions (31a) and (31c) are satisfied, and (31b) is satisfied with equality(38)C′u(iter)T0P(H¯0)ln2=I*+∑i=1M|hspi|2ψi∑i=1M|hspi|2Similar to Case-2, the solution (37) consists of the dual variable μ in the denominator which is updated by sub-gradient method as per the following expression(39)μ(it+1)=[μ(it)−Y(it)(Ith−Itotal∑i=1M|hspi|2Pti)]+So, μ converges to the optimal value when Y(it) is sufficiently small.Case 4: ϑi≠ 0 for alliϵM,η=0andμ=0. For this case, (28) reduces to(40)C′ψi(1+ψiPti)ln2−u(iter)T0P(H¯0)+ϑiC0i′=0Subject to:(40a):(29a)and(29b)(40b):log2(1+ψiPti)=RthAfter Solving (40), we have the water filling solution(41)Pti4=[C′(u(iter)T0P(H¯0)−ϑiC′0i)ln2−1ψi]+So,Pti4 in (41) consists of dual variable ϑiin the denominator. But, there is no common water level for this solution. However, we have approached this solution in a clever way. In this case, the optimal solution occurs on the plane in (40b) which is equivalent to(42)Pti4=[C′u(iter)T0P(H¯0)ln2−1ψi]+orPti4=[(2Rth)ψi−1ψi]+We have checked all the inequalities conditions given in (31a), (31b) and (31c). Also, we have evaluated the exact power allocations for these four cases. Then, we incorporate these four cases into a single Algorithm 3 to decide transmission power Ptfor Algorithm 2. For convenience, we consider thatP1=C′u(iter)T0P(H¯0)ln2,P2=PtmaxM+1M∑i=1M1ψi,P3=I*+∑i=1M|hspi|2ψi∑i=1M|hspi|2andP4=(2Rth)ψi.Algorithm 3 explains the exact power allocation to ith SU. Similarly, Ptis evaluated for all M SUs.Algorithm 1 is proposed for selecting less spatial-correlated SUs which is of complexity O(K3). In NIDM algorithm, let IuandIΔbe the number of iterations required to converge the fractional programming based on Dinkelbach method and to update the Lagrangian multipliers η and μ, respectively. Therefore, the overall complexity isO(IuIΔlog2|Δτ⌀|), where Δτ is the difference between lower and upper bound of the sensing time and∅=10−6is a small integer representing the minimum accuracy allowed in golden section search method, while the joint optimization through exhaustive search method has polynomial time complexity. Again, at each iteration of NIDM algorithm,IΔmay vary depending upon the Cases in Algorithm 3. IfPti=Pti1,IΔ=0. So, the complexity is reduced toO(Iulog2|Δτ∅|). Hence, the aid of Algorithm 3 in Algorithm 2 can be employed for solving EE maximization problem with considerably low complexity.In this Section, we present the extensive simulation results to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm over different system key parameters. We consider a CRN, where K SUs are distributed around the centrally located PU in a circular area of radius 1 km. We have assumed that K is 20, among them only suitable SUs (M=6) are chosen based on their spatial correlation as shown in Fig. 3. The CDs are distributed randomly around the PU over the same circular area of radius 1.5km. We considerσs2=1. Table 2summarises some common parameters used in our simulation results.Fig. 4 depicts the convergence comparison of our proposed scheme with Scheme I and Scheme II. In Scheme I, we jointly optimise the sensing time and transmission power allocation of SUs through the iterative process discussed in [13,14]. In Scheme II, the method of EE maximization problem formulation and the method of solving the power allocation through Lagrangian duality theorem are adopted from [10]. But the joint optimization of both sensing time and power allocation is done by using our Algorithm 2instead of using two different algorithms as in [10]. In Scheme II, the exact power allocation for Step 3 in Algorithm 2 is directly obtained by solving (27) through KKT condition i.ePti=[C′(u(iter)T0P(H¯0)+η+μItotal∑i=1M|hspi|2)ln2−1ψi]+. The other simulation parameters of this Fig. 4 areM=6, outage thresholdΓth=0.05,Rth=2bits/sec/Hz andIth=−20dBW. It is observed that, our proposed scheme outperforms the Scheme I and Scheme II.Fig. 5shows the variation of maximum EE over different SNR values forIth=−20dBW of Scheme I, Scheme II and proposed scheme. It is clearly observed that our method performs almost the same as Scheme II but gives better results than Scheme I. Though our proposed scheme performs almost same as Scheme II, but the complexity of our proposed algorithm lies between Scheme I and Scheme II. The resource allocation procedure in Scheme II has a constant complexity ofO(IuIΔlog2|Δτ∅|). But the complexity of our proposed scheme may be same or less than Scheme II depending upon the conditions given in Algorithm 3. Though the complexity of our proposed method is more than Scheme I but in terms of performance our method gives significant improvement in EE with the same simulation parameters. Hence, both Algorithms 2 and 3 jointly provides better performance with considerably less complexity. The simulation parameters are same as the parameters used to obtain Fig. 4.Fig. 6 illustrates the optimal sensing time versus SNR for M = 6 (less spatial-correlated cooperative SUs) and M = 15 (randomly selected SUs). It is clearly noticed that SUs require less sensing time at high SNR values. Further, at SNR = −24dB nearly 3.4ms out of 10ms is spent for spectrum sensing, hence larger portion of the total frame period has been allocated for spectrum sensing leaving very less duration for data transmission. So, system capacity (SC) decreases at low SNR. Simulation parameters are same as Fig. 4Fig. 7illustrates the effect of interference power threshold Ithon the maximum EE and maximum SC for SNR = −20 dB and −30 dB. The simulation parameters are M = 6, Γth= 0.09 and Rth= 2 bits/s/Hz. It is observed that with increase in Ith, EE decreases and SC increases. Increasing in Ithis not always benefitted for maximising EE though it enhances the SC. Because with increase in Ith, the total transmission power boundary increases as per (23b), which ultimately maximises SC.Fig. 8illustrates the effect of outage threshold Γthon the maximum EE and maximum SC for M = 6 andRth=2bits/s/Hz. We observe that EE increases with increase in outage threshold but SC does not show very significant changes. Hence, more outage threshold provides a better framework for energy-efficient model keeping the system throughput almost unaffected.Fig. 9presents the effect of number of cooperative SUs on maximum EE, maximum SC and total transmission power for Ith= −20 dBW and Ith= −10 dBW. It is obvious that EE decreases with increase in the number of SUs but SC increases as total transmission power increases. More SUs lead to more power consumption. However, the rate of decrease in EE does not change significantly after a certain number of SUs though the transmission power increases. Hence, an energy-efficient model can be designed by selecting suitable number of SUs to avoid unnecessary growth of power consumption. For this figure, SUs are chosen randomly from K SUs. The other simulation parameters are same as the parameters used in Fig. 4.Fig. 10shows the effect of Rthon the maximum EE and maximum SC for Ith= −20 dBW Ith= −10 dBW. The simulation parameters are M = 6 and Γth= 0.09. We observed that EE decreases with increase in Rth. This is because as Rthincreases, minimum required transmission power increases which leads to minimisation of EE. Meanwhile, SC increases with Rth.Fig. 11presents the variation of maximum EE and SC for different values of target detection probabilityP¯dfor Ith= −20 dBW and Ith= −10 dBW. The number of SUs M = 6 are selected by employing our proposed SUs selection method. It is clearly observed that SC is a decreasing function ofP¯d.The proof is given inAppendix C. EE first increases withP¯d, then decreases after a certainP¯d.
