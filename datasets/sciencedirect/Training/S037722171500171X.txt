@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The paper studies the impact of a green supplier’s overconfidence on inventory decisions in a supply chain consisting of a supplier facing effort-dependent stochastic demand and a rational retailer. The overconfident supplier may overestimate the product demand due to carbon-reduction green efforts or underestimate the variability of the stochastic demand. We characterize these two kinds of overconfidence as ability-based and precision-based overconfidence, for which we develop optimal models for three supply chain systems: integrated, vendor managed inventory, and retailer managed inventory. Extensive comparative studies are conducted to highlight the impacts of supplier's overconfidence on the inventory decisions and on different green-supply chain performance measures. We find that, under certain conditions, supplier's overconfidence prompts the supplier to exert more efforts on green manufacturing, and enhances the profits of the retailer and of the entire supply chain. Managerial insights are provided for various scenarios and propositions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recent fast economic growth has left air quality in many cities notoriously poor. Beijing is a prime example. Readings from both the official and unofficial monitoring stations suggest that air pollution had soared beyond the danger level stipulated by the WHO and reached the point deemed hazardous to human health at the beginning of year 2013. Under such a harsh environment, many customers’ preference has turned to ‘green’ products. Green credentials, such as ‘Carbon Reduction Label’, prove businesses’ commitment to carbon reduction and increase consumer's awareness of the greenhouse effect. Augstein (2011) reported that 63 percent of UK consumers are more likely to buy a specific product if they know actions were taken to reduce its greenhouse effect. As manufacturers often face effort-dependent stochastic demand, they are expected to reduce carbon footprint, adopt green materials, and lower energy consumption.In the conventional supply chain (SC), the retailer makes the inventory stocking decision. This traditional retailer-managed inventory (RMI) system is justifiable as retailers often have better information about consumer demand and can manage the inventory better by optimizing the stock level for the product. Under RMI, the retailer places orders with the manufacturer who fulfills these orders. However, recently vendor managed inventory (VMI) system has gained popularity. VMI is a supply-chain initiative where the supplier is authorized to manage inventories of agreed-upon stock-keeping units at retail locations (Cetinkaya & Lee, 2000). In practice, Wal-Mart and Proctor & Gamble (P&G) pioneered VMI implementation in 1985. VMI had dramatically improved P&G's on-time deliveries and Wal-Mart's sales by 20–25 percent and inventory turnover by 30 percent (Buzzel & Ortmeyer, 1995; Tyan & Wee, 2003). Indeed, a VMI supplier can have great influence on the performance of supply chains by optimizing inventory decisions for the downstream retailer and by making quality-improvement efforts, such as low-carbon emission production.Most of the researchers focusing on RMI/VMI and effort-dependent demand have assumed that supply chains are composed of rational players. But in reality, decision makers could be irrational due to pride or arrogance, resulting in overestimating one's competence or precision. For example, Steven Jobs, one of the greatest innovators in our time, was famous for his self-confidence. He affirmatively made his own rules on computers, stock options, and even treating his own disease. His overconfidence contributed to a good share of Apple's success and problems. The traits that made him an excellent CEO also drove him to put his company, himself, and his investors at risk (Hirshleifer, Low, & Teoh, 2012). Oftentimes, decision-makers fall into their own trap of overconfidence (Hayward & Hambrick, 1997; Li & Tang, 2010; Malmendier & Tate, 2005a, 2005b).In this paper, we address two types of overconfidence: the ability-biased overconfidence (AB) and the precision-biased overconfidence (PR). With AB, the supplier exaggerates the effect of his green-manufacturing endeavor on product demand; while with PR, the supplier underestimates the variability (standard deviation) of the stochastic demand. Such overconfidence may seriously hurt the profit of the retailer and the entire supply chain. Therefore it is important to take the supplier's overconfidence into account when facing inventory and green endeavor decisions. In this research, we investigate how the supplier's overconfidence impacts the retailer and the SC as a whole, when the demand is stochastic and effort-dependent. In particular, we develop optimal models for each of the three scenarios: integrated SC, vendor managed inventory, and retailer managed inventory and conduct extensive comparative studies to highlight the impacts of supplier's overconfidence on the supply chain performance. Specifically, we address three important SC issues:(a)How does the supplier's overconfidence affect his green-manufacturing decision, i.e. the efforts invested in low-carbon manufacturing?Could the supplier's overconfidence create more profits for his partnering retailer and the entire SC?What is the impact of supplier's overconfidence on the implementation of RMI/VMI?The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. In Section 3, we examine the characteristics of the problem and discuss basic assumptions. Various optimization models under different settings are presented in Section 4. Section 5 analyzes the influence of supplier's overconfidence and compares different types of overconfidence. Numerical examples are given in Section 6. Finally, we summarize and conclude the paper, and offer managerial insights in Section 7.Good decision-making requires not only knowledge of facts, concepts, and relationships, but also metaknowledge, which is an understanding of the limits of knowledge. Unfortunately, most decision makers tend to be overconfident in their beliefs and judgments. Because metaknowledge is neither recognized/rewarded in practice, nor instilled during formal education, overconfidence has remained a hidden flaw in managerial decision making (Russo & Schoemaker, 1992). Overconfident managers tend to escalate commitment by throwing good money, time and resources after bad investments, leading to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations and hazardous decisions (Johnson & Fowler, 2011). We have observed overconfident decision makers in financial markets (Odean, 1998), corporate investments (Malmendier & Tate, 2005a), entrepreneurs' business entries (Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg, 1988), and even in marriages (Mahar, 2003).Roll (1986) argues that overconfident managers undertake mergers and acquisitions that add no value due to overrate the return. Li and Tang (2010) find a positive relationship between CEO hubris and firm risk taking. Roland and Tirole (2002) and Steen (2004) theorize the existence of overconfidence. Moore and Healy (2008) divide overconfidence into overestimation, over-precision, and over-placement. In finance, Oberlechner and Osler (2012) show that overconfident currency dealers are not driven out of the market. Malmendier, Tate, and Yan (2011) show that overconfident managers use less external finance and issue less equity than their peers. Gervais, Heaton, and Odean (2011) show that it is cheaper to motivate overconfident managers to pursue valuable risky projects. Galasso and Simcoe (2011) learn that overconfident CEOs are more likely to pursue innovation.Van den Steen (2011) believes Bayesian agents overestimate their forecast precision. Lin, Hu, and Chen (2005) claim that the greater the forecast error, the more overconfident the manager is, and the more the firms’ earnings are over-estimated. Cooper et al. (1988) report that U.S. entrepreneurs believe the chance that other firms will succeed is 59 percent, while their estimate of their own chance of success is 81 percent.Overconfidence is thus a phenomenon too ubiquitous to be ignored, such as that found in hubristic managers who face inventory decisions in supply chain. However, to date no study has been conducted to address such an issue in SC management.There is a large literature on modeling the cost side of the supply chain inventory management in VMI and RMI. The advantages of implementing VMI over RMI include lower inventory costs, better response to market changes, lesser demand uncertainty, and more flexibility in production planning and distribution (Darwish & Odah, 2010). VMI minimizes the distortion of demand information transferred from the downstream SC member to the supplier. VMI suppliers control the downstream replenishment decisions rather than refilling orders as they are placed. Çetinkaya and Lee (2000) propose a VMI model to synchronize inventory decisions that optimize shipment and replenishment, which was later improved by Axsäter (2001). Similarly, Cheung and Lee (2002) develop a stocking-rebalancing mechanism for VMI to coordinate with the shipment decision.Often, VMI manufacturers are incentivized to maintain a high stock level to satisfy customer needs and fulfill spillover demand from competitors’ stock-out. However, a retailer may lose from VMI, depending on the profit margin, the holding costs, and the intensity of brand competition (Kim, 2008; Mishra & Raghunathan, 2004; Yu, Huang, & Liang, 2009). When product substitution is significant, VMI can exacerbate channel inefficiencies and perform worse than the traditional RMI (Kraiselburd, Narayanan, & Raman, 2004).VMI implementation presents its own challenges. VMI may be ineffective if suppliers are burdened with too much cost and inventory, and excessive shipment frequency (Cooke, 1998). Consequently, researches are drawn to measure the benefits of adopting VMI. Dong and Xu (2002) found VMI always leads to a higher retailer's profit, but supplier's profit varies. It is more likely to increase the supplier's profit in the long-run than in the short-run. Yao, Evers, and Dresner (2007) analytically examine how SC parameters affect VMI cost savings.To ensure VMI benefits all SC members, Gerchak and Wang (2004) propose a revenue-plus-surplus-subsidy incentive scheme to coordinate VMI assembly chain. Bernstein, Chen, and Federgruen (2006) show that under echelon operational autonomy, perfect coordination via simple schemes is feasible. Most studies hitherto assume that VMI players have perfect cognitive ability and possess complete SC information; only few extend to asymmetric information. For example, Corbett (2001) uses principal-agent models to study the effects of information asymmetry of setup and stock-out costs. Similarly, Yu et al. (2009) find that, in order to optimize respective net profits, the manufacturer and its retailers need to collaborate through adjusting marketing (advertising and pricing).There have been efforts to study the relationship between SC inventory decisions and green manufacturing endeavors. In their editorial for the special issue of EJOR, Leopold-Wildburger, Weber, and Zachariasen (2009) report about the recent efforts of the OR community in understanding the relationships between green efforts and the total life cycle cost reductions. The special issue published a cluster of papers which feature the state-of-the-art, challenges and ways for improving the management of sustainable development (Quariguasi Frota Neto, Walther, Bloemhof, Van Nunen, & Spengler, 2009). Recently, Brandenburg, Govindan, Sarkis, and Seuring (2014) conduct an extensive literature search on models addressing green supply chain and call for expanding the factors considered in modeling the green efforts in SC. Craig (2012) studies the relationship between consumer demand and the carbon footprint. From the perspective of TQM, researchers have studied quality attributes effect on demand (Banker, Khosla, & Sinha, 1998;Karmarkar & Pitblado, 1997; Roberts & Urban, 1988). The positive effect of “green labelling” on demand has been reported by researchers in the marketing area as well (see Elofsson, 2014; El Saadany, Jaber, & Bonney, 2011; Inman & Nikolova, 2014;Polonsky, Vocino, Grau, Garma, & Ferdous, 2012; Vanclay et al., 2011; Voros, 2002).However, the studies of demand effects of the green effort and research that incorporates deviations from rationality in decision are rather limited. We incorporate the positive demand effect of “green labelling”. We provide an interesting and important contribution to the supply chain literature by capturing the subjective biases of supply chain agents.In this section, we develop a SC model that consists of an overconfident supplier and a rational retailer. Customer demand is stochastic and is a function of the supplier's efforts in reducing the carbon footprint of the product. In the base case, we assume the demand for an unbiased cognitive supplier (Jammernegg & Kischka, 2013; Xu, Cai, & Chen, 2011) is:D(e)=t(e)·ɛ;wheree: amount of efforts the supplier exerts in developing green manufacturing.t(e): customer's perceived utility, a continuous, nonnegative function, with t'(e) > 0, and t''(e) < 0. The more effort the supplier exerts, the higher the customers’ perceived utility, but marginal effort has diminishing return in utility.ɛ: stochastic factor that influences the demand and is normally distributed, N(μ, σ).The pdf and cdf are f(⋅) and F(⋅) respectivelyWe model the hubris effect in two different ways. That is, the supplier is an overconfident player, either with an ability-biased overconfidence (AB) or with a precision-biased overconfidence (PR).Facing AB supplier:With AB, the supplier would exaggerate (or overestimate) the impacts of his carbon-lowering green-effort on product demand, and overestimate his customers’ utility. The overestimated demand function can be expressed as:DAB(e)=λt(e)·ɛ,where λ > 1 and larger λ implies more overconfidence. ɛ∼N(μ, σ). The pdf and cdf are f(⋅) and F(⋅) respectively.Facing PR supplier:With PR, the supplier underestimates the variability (standard deviation) of the stochastic demand:DPR(e)=t(e)·ɛPR,where 0 < η < 1 and smaller η implies more overconfidence (i.e. the supplier is too confident about his precision). ɛPR ∼ N(μ, ησ). The pdf and cdf are h(⋅) and H(⋅) respectively.Cost function and other notations:g(e): cost incurred from exerting the effort e; g(0) = 0; g'(e) > 0 and g''(e) > 0. This implies that the more effort the supplier exerts, the higher the cost; and the marginal cost of effort is positive.c: the unit manufacturing cost of the product;w: the unit wholesale price of the product;p: the unit retail price of the product;v: the unit residual (salvage) value of the surplus product, where v < c;qij: the replenishment quantity in scenarioij, wherei = 1 for integrated supply chain; i = 2 for VMI; and i = 3 for RMI.j = 0 for unbiased cognition; j = 1 for AB cognition; while j = 2 for PR cognition.eij: the level of the supplier's effort in scenario ij, with i and j defined as above.Superscripts AB and PR show that the variable is under the supplier's AB-biased or PR-biased cognition.We can now write the expected sales quantity and surplus quantity as follows.Under unbiased cognition:E[min{D(ei0),qi0}]=qi0−t(ei0)·∫0qi0t(ei0)F(x)dxE[qi0−D(ei0)]+=t(ei0)·∫0qi0t(ei0)F(x)dxUnder AB-biased cognition:E[min{DAB(ei1),qi1}]=qi1−λt(ei1)·∫0qi1λt(ei1)F(x)dxE[qi1−DAB(ei1)]+=λt(ei1)·∫0qi1λt(ei1)F(x)dx.Under PR-biased cognition:E[min{DPR(ei2),qi2}]=qi2−t(ei2)·∫0qi2t(ei2)H(x)dxE[qi2−DPR(ei2)]+=t(ei2)·∫0qi2t(ei2)H(x)dxWe consider the scenario of an integrated SC whose decisions provide an optimal solution and serve as a benchmark for analyzing the decisions under different SC structures. Here, the level of carbon-lowering effort e10 and the replenishment quantity q10 are decision variables. Based on the demand function derived in Section 3, we find the expected profit of the SC in this scenario is:(1)πwh(e10,q10)=p·E[min{D(e10),q10}]+v·E[q10−D(e10)]+−cq10−g(e10)=p·(q10−t(e10)·∫0q10t(e10)F(x)dx)+v·t(e10)·∫0q10t(e10)F(x)dx−cq10−g(e10)=(p−c)q10−(p−v)·t(e10)·∫0q10t(e10)F(x)dx−g(e10)The first and second derivatives of Eq. (1) with respect to q10 are:∂πwh(e10,q10)∂q10=(p−c)−(p−v)F(q10t(e10))∂2πwh(e10,q10)∂2q10=−p−vt(e10)f(q10t(e10))<0Let∂πwh(e10,q10)∂q10=0, then we have:(2)F(q10*t(e10))=p−cp−vThus, the optimal replenishment quantity under centralized decision satisfies(3)q10*=t(e10)·F−1(p−cp−v)=t(e10)·(μ+σL1)and we assignL1=Φ−1(p−cp−v).By taking the first and second derivatives of πwh(e10, q10) with respect to e10, we have:∂πwh(e10,q10)∂e10=−(p−v)·t′(e10)·∫0q10t(e10)F(x)dx+(p−v)·q10F(q10t(e10))t′(e10)t(e10)−g′(e10)=(p−v)t′(e10)(q10t(e10)F(q10t(e10))−∫0q10t(e10)F(x)dx)−g′(e10)∂2πwh(e10,q10)∂2e10=(p−v)t′′(e10)(q10t(e10)F(q10t(e10))−∫0q10t(e10)F(x)dx)−(p−v)[q10t′(e10)]2[t(e10)]3f(q10t(e10))−g′′(e10)Because t''(e10) < 0, g''(e10) > 0, andq10t(e10)F(q10t(e10))−∫0q10t(e10)F(x)dx=∫0q10t(e10)xf(x)dx>0, we have∂2πwh(e10,q10)∂2e10<0.Let∂πwh(e10,q10)∂e10=0, and we find the optimal effort will satisfy the following equation:(4)t′(e10*)g′(e10*)=1(p−v)(q10t(e10)F(q10t(e10))−∫0q10t(e10)F(x)dx)By plugging in Eq. (2), we simplify Eq. (4) to:(5)t′(e10*)g′(e10*)=1(p−v)∫0F−1(p−cp−v)xf(x)dx=1(p−v)(μΦ(L1)−σϕ(L1))Under VMI, the supplier is in charge of making replenishment decisions for the retailer. The retailer only makes payment to the supplier for the sold products.With ability-biased overconfidence, the supplier's profit function becomes:(6)πsAB(e21,q21)=w·E[min{DAB(e21),q21}]+v·E[q21−DAB(e21)]+−cq21−g(e21)=(w−c)q21−(w−v)·λt(e21)·∫0q21λt(e21)F(x)dx−g(e21)By taking the first and second derivatives of Eq. (6) with respect toq21, we have∂2πsAB(e21,q21)∂2q21<0. Let∂πsAB(e21,q21)∂q21=0; we find:(7)F(q21*λt(e21))=w−cw−vThus, the optimal replenishment quantity under VMI is:(8)q21*=λt(e21)·F−1(w−cw−v)=λt(e21)·(μ+σL2)Here, we assignL2=Φ−1(w−cw−v)Becauseq21t(e21)F(q21λt(e21))−λ∫0q21λt(e21)F(x)dx=λ∫0q21λt(e21)xf(x)dx>0, t''(e21) < 0 and g''(e21) > 0, we have∂2πsAB(e21,q21)∂2e21<0. Let∂πsAB(e21,q21)∂e21=0, and we find the supplier's optimal effort in this scenario satisfies the following equation:(9)t′(e21*)g′(e21*)=1(w−v)(q21t(e21)F(q21λt(e21))−λ∫0q21λt(e21)F(x)dx)By plugging in Eq. (7), we simplify Eq. (9) to:(10)t′(e21*)g′(e21*)=1(w−v)λ∫0F−1(w−cw−v)xf(x)dx=1(w−v)λ(μΦ(L2)−σϕ(L2))=1(w−c)λμ−(w−v)λσϕ(L2)With precision-biased overconfidence, the supplier's profit function becomes:(11)πsPR(e22,q22)=w·E[min{DPR(e22),q22}]+v·E[q22−DPR(e22)]+−cq22−g(e22)=(w−c)q22−(w−v)t(e22)·∫0q22t(e22)H(x)dx−g(e22)From above we find that∂2πsPR(e22,q22)∂2q22<0. When∂πsPR(e22,q22)∂q22=0, we have:(12)E(q22*t(e22))=w−cw−vThus, the optimal replenishment quantity under PR is:(13)q22*=t(e22)·E−1(w−cw−v)=t(e22)·(μ+ηL2σ)Because t''(e22) < 0, g''(e22) > 0,q22t(e22)E(q22t(e22))−b∫0q22t(e22)H(x)dx=∫0q22t(e22)xe(x)dx>0, we have∂2πsPR(e22,q22)∂2e22<0.When∂πsPR(e22,q22)∂e22=0, we find the optimal effort under the PR case satisfies the following condition:(14)t′(e22*)g′(e22*)=1(w−v)(q22t(e22)E(q22t(e22))−∫0q22t(e22)H(x)dx)By plugging in Eq. (12), we simplify Eq. (14) to:(15)t′(e22*)g′(e22*)=1(w−v)(μΦ(L2)−ησϕ(L2))=1(w−c)μ−(w−v)ησϕ(L2)For comparison purpose, we examine the case of traditional RMI. We assume the supplier is the Stackelberg leader, who first decides how much effort he will make on green manufacturing. Then, the retailer as the SC follower makes plans on replenishment and places orders to the supplier. To address his problem, the supplier needs to first estimate the retailer's response function.Similar to Section 4.2.1, given e31, the estimated response function (i.e. decision on replenishment order quantity) of the retailer under AB is:(16)q31(e31)*=λt(e31)·F−1(p−wp−v)=λt(e31)·(μ+L3σ)And we defineL3=Φ−1(p−wp−v).From Eq. (16), we find the supplier's AB-biased profit function would be:(17)πsAB(e31)=(w−c)q31(e31)−g(e31)=(w−c)λt(e31)·F−1(p−wp−v)−g(e31)Through∂πsAB(e31)∂e31=0, we find the AB-biased optimal effort will satisfy the following condition:(18)t′(e31*)g′(e31*)=1(w−c)λF−1(p−wp−v)=1(w−c)λ(μ+L3σ)Similar to Section 4.2.2, given e32, the retailer's estimated response function under the supplier's PR-biased cognition is:(19)q32(e32)*=t(e32)·E−1(p−wp−v)=t(e32)·(μ+ηL3σ)From Eq. (19), we find the supplier's PR-biased profit function would be:(20)πsPR(e32)=(w−c)q32(e32)−g(e32)=(w−c)t(e32)·(μ+ηL3σ)−g(e32)Through∂πsPR(e32)∂e32=0, we find the optimal effort will satisfy the following equation:(21)t′(e32*)g′(e32*)=1(w−c)E−1(p−wp−v)=1(w−c)(μ+ησL3)It is worth noting that Eqs. (16) and (19) are the “projected” (not actual) response functions of the retailer when the supplier is overconfident. Given the supplier's effort level e3j, the retailer's realized profit is:πr(q30(e3j))=p·E[min{D(e3j),q30}]+v·E[q30−D(e3j)]+−wq30=(p−w)q30−(p−v)·t(e3j)·∫0q30t(e3j)F(x)dxThus, the actual response function of the retailer is:(22)q30(e3j)*=t(e3j*)·F−1(p−wp−v)=t(e3j*)·(μ+L3σ)We now derive, discuss and contrast the impacts of AB- and PR-biased cognitions on various supply chain decisions and performance. In Table 1, we present a summary of Propositions 1–10, which will be derived next.Supplier's overconfidence influences the decisions of SC members and profits. Here, we study the effects of supplier's overestimation in customers’ utility and market demand.Proposition 1The “projected” optimal level of the supplier's effort under VMI and RMI increases with the AB-biased coefficient λ; and e31* is consistently larger than e21*.Lety(eij)=t′(eij)g′(eij). According to our assumptions, we have t'(eij) > 0, g'(eij) > 0. So y(eij) > 0. By Eq. (10), we have1(w−v)λ(μΦ(L2)−σϕ(L2))>0. So y(e21) decreases with λ. By Eq. (18), we find y(e31) decrease with λ.Then again, by taking the first derivative of y(eij) with respect to eij, we havey′(eij)=t′′(eij)g′(eij)−t′(eij)g′′(eij)[g′(eij)]2<0. So y(eij) decreases with eij, and we conclude that when λ increases, y(eij) will decrease and eijwill increase.Additionally, by substituting L2 and L3 into Eqs. (10) and (18), we havey(e21*)=1(w−v)λ(μΦ(L2)−σϕ(L2))=1(w−c)λμ−(w−v)λσϕ(L2)y(e31*)=1(w−c)λ(μ+L3σ)=1(w−c)λμ+(w−c)λL3σThus, y(e31*) < y(e21*). Because y(e) decreases with e, we proved that e31* > e21*. □Proposition 2The “projected” optimal replenishment quantities under VMI and RMI increase with the AB-biased coefficient λ.From Eqs. (8) and (22), Proposition 1, and t'(e) > 0, we find the proof is straight forward and omit it here.The intuition behind Propositions 1 and 2 is that when the supplier is AB-biased, he would exaggerate the effects of his green efforts on demand by the AB-biased coefficient λ. As a result, given the same cost function of the green efforts, the supplier would choose a higher “projected” green effort level and higher “projected” replenishment quantity when he has a higher λ. □Proposition 3Both the AB-biased “projected” profits of the supplier under VMI and RMI increase with the coefficient λ.By substituting Eq. (8) into Eq. (6), we obtain the AB-biased “projected” profit of the supplier under VMI:(23)πsAB(e21*,q21*)=λt(e21*)((w−c)F−1(w−cw−v)∫0F−1(w−cw−v)−(w−v)∫0F−1(w−cw−v)F(x)dx)−g(e21*)Taking the first derivative of Eq. (23) with respect to λ, we have:(24)∂πsAB(e21*,q21*)∂λ=t(e21*)((w−c)F−1(w−cw−v)−(w−v)∫0F−1(w−cw−v)F(x)dx)+λt′(e21*)∂e21*∂λ((w−c)F−1(w−cw−v)∫0F−1(w−cw−v)−(w−v)∫0F−1(w−cw−v)F(x)dx)−g(e21*)∂e21*∂λBy incorporating Eq. (10), we have∂πsAB(e21*,q21*)∂λ=t(e21*)(w−v)∫0F−1(w−cw−v)xf(x)dx>0Thus, the AB-biased “projected” profit of the supplier under VMI increases with the coefficient λ. See Appendix for RMI proof.In Proposition 3, we approximate the AB-biased “projected” profits of the supplier. It is worth mentioning that Eq. (23) is the supplier's perceived profit function, which is a subjective judgment. It is intuitive to see that because the product demand is exaggerated by λ, the “projected” profit function is also exaggerated with λ. But the supplier's actual profit finally realized is in fact determined under unbiased cognition and this prompts us to develop Proposition 4 below. □Proposition 4The actual profits of the supplier under both the VMI and RMI decrease with the AB-biased coefficient λ.Under VMI, the actual profit of the supplier is:(25)πs(e21*,q21*)=(w−c)q21*−(w−v)t(e21*)∫0q21*t(e21*)F(x)dx−g(e21*)Taking the first derivative of Eq. (26) with respect to λ, we have(27)∂πs(e21*,q21*)∂λ=∂e21*∂λ(t′(e21*)(w−c)λF−1(w−cw−v)∫0λF−1(w−cw−v)−t′(e21*)(w−v)∫0λF−1(w−cw−v)F(x)dx−g′(e21*))+t(e21*){(w−c)F−1(w−cw−v)−(w−v)F−1(w−cw−v)F[λF−1(w−cw−v)]}By substituting Eq. (9) into (27), we have∂πs(e21*,q21*)∂λ=−∂e21*∂λt′(e21*)(w−v)∫F−1(w−cw−v)λF−1(w−cw−v)F(x)dx+t(e21*)w−vF−1(w−cw−v){F[F−1(w−cw−v)]−F[λF−1(w−cw−v)]}<0Thus, the actual profit of the supplier under VMI decreases with λ. See Appendix for RMI proof.Because the supplier overestimates the effects of his green efforts on product demand, as a result, his overinvestment in green efforts (Proposition 1) and over replenishment (Proposition 2) will in fact hurt his “actual” profit eventually. □Proposition 5The actual profits of the retailer under both VMI and RMI increase with the supplier's AB-biased coefficient λ.The profit of the retailer under VMI is:(28)πr(q21*,e21*)=(p−w)·(q21*−t(e21*)·∫0q21*t(e21*)F(x)dx)By substituting Eq. (8) into (28), we have(29)πr(q21*,e21*)=(p−w)t(e21*)(λF−1(w−cw−v)−∫0λF−1(w−cw−v)F(x)dx)Taking the first derivative of Eq. (29) with respect to λ, we have∂πr(q21*,e21*)∂λ=(p−w)t′(e21*)∂e21*∂λ(λF−1(w−cw−v){1−F[λF−1(w−cw−v)]}∫0λF−1(w−cw−v)+∫0λF−1(w−cw−v)xf(x)dx)+(p−w)t(e21*)F−1(w−cw−v)×{1−F[λF−1(w−cw−v)]}>0Thus, the actual profit of the retailer under VMI increases with λ. See Appendix for RMI proof.The supplier's actual profit is hurt by his own AB overconfidence due to over investment in green efforts and over replenishment (Proposition 4). However, it is beneficial to the retailer, as the retailer doesn't need to bear the green effort cost but benefits from the over replenishment by the supplier. As a result, the “actual” profit of the retailer would increase with λ. □Proposition 6The “projected” optimal level of the supplier's carbon-lowering effort under VMI decreases with the PR-biased coefficient η, while the level of the effort under RMI increases with η. And e32* is consistently higher than e22*. □As in Proposition 1, because y'(e) < 0, y(e) decreases with e. From Eq. (15), we find y(e22) increases with ηunder VMI, so e22 decreases with η. Likewise, Eq. (21) implies y(e32) decreases with η under RMI. So, e32 increases with η. Similarly, we can easily prove that y(e32*) < y(e22*), so e32* > e22*.The “projected” optimal replenishment quantity under RMI increases with the PR-biased coefficient η; while the optimal quantity under VMI depends on the following conditions:{q22*increaseswithη,whent′(e22*)∂e22*∂η(μ+ηL2σ)+L2σt(e22*)>0q22*decreaseswithη,whent′(e22*)∂e22*∂η(μ+ηL2σ)+L2σt(e22*)<0Under RMI, from Eq. (22), Proposition 6, and t'(e) > 0, we find that q30(e32)* increases with η.Under VMI, by taking the first derivative of Eq. (13) with respect to η, we have:∂q22*∂η=t′(e22*)∂e22*∂η(μ+ηL2σ)+L2σt(e22*)From Proposition 6, we conclude∂e22∂η<0, so Proposition 7 on the VMI case is proved. □Proposition 8The “projected” PR-biased profit of the supplier under VMI decreases with the coefficient η; while the PR-biased “projected” profit under RMI increases with the coefficient η.Under VMI, we substitute Eq. (13) into (11) and find(30)πsPR(e22*,q22*)=t(e22*)((w−c)·(μ+ηL2σ)−(w−v)∫0μ+ηL2σH(x)dx)−g(e22*)=t(e22*)(w−v)(μΦ(L2)−ησϕ(L2))−g(e22*)Thus, the PR-biased biased “projected” profit of the supplier under VMI decreases with the coefficient η. See Appendix for RMI proof. □Proposition 9The actual profits of the supplier under both VMI and RMI increase with the PR-biased coefficient η.Under VMI, the actual profit of the supplier is:(31)πs(e22,q22)=w·E[min{D(e22),q22}]+v·E[q22−D(e22)]+−cq22−g(e22)=(w−c)q22−(w−v)t(e22)·∫0q22t(e22)F(x)dx−g(e22)Thus, the actual profit of the supplier under VMI increases with η. See Appendix for RMI proof. □Proposition 10The actual profits of the retailer under both VMI and RMI increase with the supplier's PR-biased coefficient η.The actual profit of the retailer under VMI is(34)πr(q22*,e22*)=(p−w)·(q22*−t(e22*)·∫0q22*t(e22*)F(x)dx)The takeaway is that unlike the AB-biased case, green effort, replenishment quantities, and the “projected” profit under the PR-biased case depend on whether the SC is VMI or RMI. Under VMI, a more hubristic manufacturer (underestimating variability in the demand) invests more in green effort and hence projects higher profit. However, under RMI, the opposite is true. A more hubristic supplier under RMI does not invest in green effort as much since the demand variability is experienced and absorbed by the retailer. Further, due to lower green effort, the PR-biased hubristic supplier's projected profit is lower.The hubristic supplier's actual profits are lower for both VMI and RMI cases. Underestimating variability hurts the hubristic supplier under VMI due to inventory consequences, and under RMI due to lower investment in green efforts.Recall that in the AB-biased case, actual profits of the retailer are positively associated with the hubristic supplier's overestimation of the demand. However, PR-biased case hurts the retailer as well, since the RMI is very much dependent upon the variability in the demand. Similarly, because the supplier underestimates the variability of demand and could not replenish enough, this will increase the possibility of stock-outs at the retailer and eventually hurt the actual profit of the retailer. □In this subsection, we will compare the VMI and RMI under AB- and PR-biased decisions and performance, and provide insights for supplier selection.Proposition 11Under VMI, the “projected” optimal effort level, the “projected” optimal replenishment quantity, and the actual profit of the retailer under PR-biased cognition are all smaller than those under AB-biased cognition, if the following “normal” condition holds:(w−c)μ(λ−1)>(w−v)(λ−η)σϕ(L2)If the above condition holds, by Eqs. (10) and (15), we can easily prove that e21* > e22*. Because λ(μ + σL2) > μ + ησL2, by Eqs. (8) and (13), we conclude thatq21*>q22*.Under VMI,πr(q2j*,e2j*)=(p−w)t(e2j*)(T−∫0TF(x)dx). LetT=q2j*t(e2j*). By taking the first derivative ofπr(q2j*,e2j*)with respect to T, we have:∂πr(q2j*,e2j*)∂T=(p−w)t(e2j*)(1−F(T))>0Because λ(μ + σL2) > μ + ησL2, we haveq21*t(e21*)>q22*t(e22*); soπr(q21*,e21*)>πr(q22*,e22*). □Proposition 12Under RMI, the “projected” optimal effort level, the “projected” replenishment quantity, and the actual profit of the retailer under PR-biased cognition are all smaller than those under AB-biased cognition.Because λ(μ + σL3) > μ + ησL3, by Eqs. (18) and (21), we have e32* < e31*. Similarly, because e32* < e31*, by Eq. (22) we have q30(e32)* < q30(e31)*.Since under RMI, πr(q30(e3j)*) = t(e3j*)(p − v)(μΦ(L3) − σϕ(L3)), we conclude πr(q30(e32)*) < πr(q30(e31)*).These two propositions lead us to some policy guidelines with a caveat that it is not straightforward for a retailer to a priori know the type of bias of a supplier. A retailer under RMI is always better off selecting an AB-biased supplier than a PR-biased one, as an AB-biased supplier will exert more efforts in green manufacturing, replenish a larger volume of inventory, and allow the retailer to realize a higher profit. Under the VMI, the same is true with some restrictions in the model parameters as shown in Proposition 11. □We now conduct numerical experiments and graphically illustrate the influence of the AB-and the PR-biased overconfidence on managerial decisions. We also compare the performances of the SC in VMI and RMI under supplier's biased cognition. The input parameters of the example are given as: p = 30, w = 15, c = 5, v = 3, ɛN(100, 15). We also assign t(e) = ln (e + 2) and g(e) = e2/2. Under the integrated SC, the optimal effort level and the replenishment quantity can be found by applying Eqs. (1), (2) and (5). We find that e10* = 48.44 and q10* = 477.12, and the overall profit isπwh(e10*, q10*) = 8406.09.The supplier's optimal effort level under AB is shown in Fig. 1, while that for PR is displayed in Fig. 2. We verify that the optimal efforts under RMI and VMI both grow with the supplier's AB-biased overconfidence. The optimal effort under VMI increases with the supplier's PR-biased overconfidence, but the one under RMI decreases. Moreover, the supplier's effort under RMI is always larger than that under VMI regardless of the type of the overconfidence. Note that as the benchmark of comparison, the supplier's optimal effort level under integrated supply chain and unbiased cognition is e10* = 48.44.Table 2shows that the replenishment quantities under VMIq21*and under RMI q30(e31)* both increase with the supplier's AB-biased cognition, withq21*rising faster than q30(e31)*.Recall that under PR, more overconfidencecorresponds to smaller η. Table 3shows that the replenishment quantities under VMIq22*and under RMI q30(e32)* both decrease with the decrease of η, indicating that the optimal replenishment quantity under PR is positively associated with η. The more PR-biased overconfident the supplier is (i.e. smaller η), the less replenishment quantities he will supply, withq22*decreasing faster than q30(e32)*. Note that q10* = 477.12, the case under integrated supply chain and unbiased cognition.Fig. 3 exhibits such relationships. We notice that the optimal replenishment quantities under AB are higher than those under PR in both scenarios. We thus have numerically validated Propositions 11 and 12.In Fig. 4, we find that the more confident the supplier is, the less profit he can actually generate, though his projected (subjectively anticipated) profits rise with the overconfidence level. The differences in profits between the projected and the actual ones grow significantly larger with λ.Fig. 5shows that the retailer actually benefits more when the supplier's AB-biased overconfidence is more pronounced. Fig. 6reveals that the profit of the entire SC under VMI reaches its peak at 8078 when λ = 1.15, but it drops considerably with the increase of the supplier's AB-overconfidence. In contrast, the profits under RMI are more comparable across different degrees of overconfidence. The maximal overall profit under RMI is 8084 when λ = 2.35. Moreover, the overall profit under VMI is slightly larger than that under RMI when AB-biased overconfidence is relatively small (λ < 1.45), while that under RMI is higher when λ > 1.45.From Table 4, we find both the actual profits of the supplier (πs(e22, q22)) and the retailer (πr(e22, q22)) decrease when the supplier is more overconfident on precision (smaller η). So is the biased profit of the supplier (πsPR(e32)) under RMI. However, the biased profit of the supplier under VMI (πsPR(e22,q22)) increases with the PR-related overconfidence. Moreover, we find that under VMI and PR-biased cognition, the supplier believes he would profit more than he actually could (πsPR(e22,q22)>πs(e22,q22)). However, his expected profit under RMI is less than that can be realized (πsPR(e32)<πs(e32)). Therefore, PR biases motivate the supplier to implement VMI.From Fig. 6, we find that under AB, the overall SC profits first rise and then decrease as the supplier becomes more overconfident; while under PR (see Fig. 7), the overall profits decline with η, with the profit under VMI dropping faster than that under RMI. Note that the overall SC profit under integrated supply chain and unbiased cognition is πwh(e10*, q10*) = 8406.09.We study how green efforts impact supply chain performances in a market with an overconfident supplier and a rational retailer. By developing models under three scenarios (integrated SC, VMI and RMI), and two types of overconfidence (AB- and PR-biased cognition), we propose mechanisms to address supplier's overconfidence issue and examine how they affect the performance of each SC player and the SC as a whole. Numerical studies are conducted to understand the proposed models and validate our propositions.Our models predict that in most of the cases a hubristic supplier is likely to invest more in green endeavors. Further, a hubristic supplier exerts more green effort under RMI than under VMI. And the optimal effort level under RMI and VMI are likely to be higher than that under the integrated SC. Our results provide useful policy guidelines for a retail manager. For example, based on our closed form solutions, we can recommend a retailer to actively seek a hubristic AB-biased supplier, since we proved that the retailer can benefit from such a supplier. Our models also provide insights for managing supply chains; and within a normal range, the AB-overconfidence can lead to higher SC profits.A natural extension of our research would be to test our model predictions. For example our analysis predicts that a hubristic supplier's actual profits are lower under both VMI and RMI. Indeed, in the Organization and Entrepreneurship literature, Trevelyan (2008a, 2008b) provides some evidence corroborating our predictions. Mueller (2012) reports the case of “death by hubris”, where a CEO's overconfidence led a company toward bankruptcy. Unfortunately, in spite of much interest in “big data” and business analytics, OM field has not had systematic industry or firm level data available, unlike the finance and marketing areas. Therefore, a systematic statistical analysis of our model predictions is a topic for future research.From the policy implementation perspective, this study is limited in that it requires retail managers to know a priori the nature of the supplier's overconfidence. We note this as a limitation. From the modelling perspective, one can extend our model and design contracts to motivate the supplier and the retailer to collaborate so as to maximize the SC performance. Also, more than one overconfident player can be involved in the inventory management process. Finally, if the degree of the overconfidence is asymmetric, a number of improved models and coordinative contracts can be developed to extend the models we proposed.Proposition 3ProofUnder RMI we take the first derivative of Eq. (17) with respect to λ and have:∂πsAB(e31*)∂λ=(w−c)t(e31*)F−1(p−wp−v)+∂e31*∂λ((w−c)λt′(e31*)F−1(p−wp−v)−g′(e31*))Incorporating Eq. (18), we find that:∂πsAB(e31*)∂λ=(w−c)t(e31*)F−1(p−wp−v)>0Thus, the AB-biased “projected” profit of the supplier under RMI increases with the coefficient λ. □Proposition 4ProofBy incorporating Eq.
