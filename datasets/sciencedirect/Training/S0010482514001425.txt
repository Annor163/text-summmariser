@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Since the first pandemic outbreak of avian influenza A virus (H5N1 subtype) in 1997, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has provided a large number of influenza virus sequences with well-organized annotations. Using the time-series sequences of influenza A viruses, we developed a simulation tool for influenza virus, named SimFlu, to predict possible future variants of influenza viruses. SimFlu can create variants from a seed nucleotide sequence of influenza A virus using the codon variation parameters included in the SimFlu package. The SimFlu library provides pre-calculated codon variation parameters for the H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 subtypes of influenza A virus isolated from 2000 to 2011, allowing the users to simulate their own nucleotide sequences by selecting their preferred parameter options. SimFlu supports three operating systems – Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. SimFlu is publicly available at http://lcbb.snu.ac.kr/simflu.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Influenza virus causes respiratory illness and several pandemic outbreaks globally each year. Spanish flu (A/H1N1) in 1918, Asian flu (A/H2N2) in 1957, Hong Kong flu (A/H3N2) in 1968, and swine flu (A/H1N1) in 2009 are representative influenza viruses with pandemic outbreaks that have caused many deaths [1,2]. Influenza virus is a negative-sense RNA virus with haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes, the products of which are present on the viral surface, as well as six internal genes (M1, M2, NP, PA, PB1, PB2) [3]. Influenza virus has a segmented genome, which facilitates genetic reassortment to produce a new subtype [4,5]. The new viral subtype often shows improved evasion of the host immune response, causing more rapid and efficient infections, which can increase viral spread and cause pandemic outbreaks [1,4,6]. Further studies are required to characterize past influenza pandemics, which have occurred periodically.In this report, we introduce an easy-to-use simulation tool for influenza virus, named SimFlu, which can simulate possible variants of influenza A virus genes using codon variation parameters calculated from available gene sequences. The current version of SimFlu supports variation parameters for the H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 subtypes of influenza A virus isolated from 2000 to 2011.The SimFlu tool can be used for computational simulations based on the changing codon patterns over time in the influenza virus nucleotide sequences. Since the pandemic outbreak of the novel influenza A virus (H1N1 subtype) in 2009, many groups have attempted to develop simulation tools to model the large-scale spread of influenza virus [2,7–11]. However, the majority of these tools are designed to simulate the spreading patterns across target cities or countries, instead of considering the changing patterns of viral genomes. For example, FluSurge and FluAid, developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are pandemic flu preparation tools based on a static modeling approach, while FluTE is an individual-based dynamic modeling platform that creates synthetic populations based on typical American communities, providing information to reduce epidemic peaks, illness, and mortality [7]. Some Asian countries, such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, undertook the AsiaFluCap project from 2008 to 2011, and developed a simulation tool named the AsiaFluCap simulator to estimate the impact on health care resource capacity during pandemics [11] (Table 1). The feature that most distinguishes SimFlu from other simulation tools is that it can simulate possible variants from the user׳s seed sequence. With this program, users can generate future variant sequences on a case-by-case basis. Because the SimFlu program provides the pre-calculated codon variation parameters as a library, it is not necessary to perform complicated and time-consuming analyses.
