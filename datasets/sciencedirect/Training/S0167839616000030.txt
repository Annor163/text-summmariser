@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we define Tchebycheffian spline spaces over planar T-meshes and we address the problem of determining their dimension. We extend to the Tchebycheffian spline context the homological approach previously used to characterize polynomial spline spaces over T-meshes, and we exploit this characterization in the study of the dimension. In particular, we give combinatorial lower and upper bounds for the dimension, and we show that these bounds coincide if the dimensions of the underlying extended Tchebycheff section spaces are large enough with respect to the smoothness, under some mild conditions on the T-mesh. Finally, we provide simple examples of Tchebycheffian spline spaces over T-meshes with unstable dimension, which means that their dimension depends on the exact geometry of the T-mesh. These results are extensions of those known in the literature for polynomial spline spaces over T-meshes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Tchebycheff spaces, or more precisely extended Tchebycheff spaces, are natural generalizations of algebraic polynomial spaces (Karlin and Studden, 1966; Schumaker, 2007). They are a popular tool in approximation theory, especially because they form a very flexible substitute for algebraic polynomial spaces to solve Hermite interpolation problems. Besides algebraic polynomial spaces, important examples of extended Tchebycheff spaces are the null spaces of differential operators with real constant coefficients.Univariate Tchebycheffian splines are smooth piecewise functions with sections in extended Tchebycheff spaces. They have several advantages over classical (algebraic) polynomial splines, mainly due to the wide variety that extended Tchebycheff spaces offer. Despite this flexibility, many results of the polynomial framework extend in a natural way to the larger Tchebycheffian spline framework, ranging from approximation theory to geometric modelling, see Lyche et al. (1998), Mazure (2011), Schumaker (2007). In particular, Tchebycheffian splines admit a representation in terms of basis functions with similar properties as polynomial B-splines. Moreover, the elegant blossoming approach and classical algorithms (like degree elevation, knot insertion, differentiation formulas, etc.) can be rephrased for them (Goodman and Mazure, 2001; Lyche, 1985; Mazure, 2011).Multivariate extensions of Tchebycheffian splines can be easily obtained via the tensor-product approach and have been applied in different contexts. For example, tensor-products of so-called generalized splines (which are a special class of Tchebycheffian splines) are a promising problem-dependent tool in isogeometric analysis, a recent paradigm for the numerical treatment of partial differential equations (Manni et al., 2011).Adaptive local refinement is important for both geometric modelling and numerical simulation. Unfortunately, a simple tensor-product spline structure lacks adequate local refinement. This triggered the interest in alternative spline structures supporting local refinement. Confining the discussion to local tensor-product structures, we mention (analysis-suitable) T-splines (Li and Scott, 2014; Sederberg et al., 2003), hierarchical splines (Forsey and Bartels, 1988; Giannelli et al., 2012), and locally refined (LR-)splines (Dokken et al., 2013). All of them can be seen as special cases of polynomial splines over T-meshes (Deng et al., 2006, 2008; Schumaker and Wang, 2012). In the more recent literature we also find some specific generalizations to the Tchebycheffian spline setting. For example, generalized T-splines (Bracco et al., 2014; Bracco and Cho, 2014), hierarchical generalized splines (Manni et al., 2014) and generalized splines on T-meshes (Bracco et al., 2016; Bracco and Roman, 2016) have been addressed. A multiresolution approach based on specific tensor-product Tchebycheffian splines has been considered in Lyche and Schumaker (2000). However, Tchebycheffian splines in their wide generality over T-meshes have not been previously investigated.In this paper we consider Tchebycheffian spline spaces over T-meshes. As in the polynomial case, a complete understanding of these spline spaces requires the knowledge of the dimension of the spline space defined on a prescribed T-mesh for a given smoothness. Of course, it is of particular interest to understand when the dimension only depends on combinatorial quantities of the T-mesh (such as number of vertices, edges and faces), on the given smoothness, and on the componentwise dimensions (saypi+1) of the underlying extended Tchebycheff section spaces.The dimension of spline spaces is said to be unstable if it depends on the exact geometry of the T-mesh. Spline spaces with unstable dimensions are not robust for practical use. Hence, it is important to detect whether or not there are instabilities in the dimension and to identify stable families of spaces. This instability phenomenon can be illustrated with the T-mesh in Fig. 1: the dimension of theC1quadratic polynomial spline space over the depicted T-mesh is 37 but reduces to 36 if, for example, the values3is slightly perturbed (Li and Chen, 2011).The dimension of polynomial spline spaces on a prescribed T-mesh for a given componentwise degreepiand smoothnessrihas been addressed by several authors using different techniques, see Deng et al. (2006), Dokken et al. (2013), Li and Chen (2011), Mourrain (2014), Schumaker and Wang (2012), Zeng et al. (2015) and references therein, and it turns out to be a very challenging problem. Lower and upper bounds for the dimension are known, and an explicit expression has been determined in some special cases. In particular, the dimension is known for spline spaces over so-called quasi-cross-cut T-meshes (Mourrain, 2014) – these are meshes where each edge extends to the boundary – and for spline spaces withpi≥2ri+1under some mild conditions on the T-mesh (Deng et al., 2006; Mourrain, 2014; Schumaker and Wang, 2012). On the other hand, instability in the dimension can occur if the degree is not large enough with respect to the smoothness, see Li and Chen (2011) for the casepi=ri+1and see Berdinsky et al. (2012) for some specific examples with a larger gap between degree and smoothness.The dimension problem of spline spaces over T-meshes faces the same difficulties as the dimension problem of polynomial spline spaces of total degree p over triangulations, see Lai and Schumaker (2007) and references therein. In the latter case, the dimension is known for spline spaces over quasi-cross-cut partitions (Chui and Wang, 1983; Schenk and Stillman, 1997), and for spline spaces withp≥3r+2(Hong, 1991; Ibrahim and Schumaker, 1991). Instability in the dimension has been illustrated forp=2rin Diener (1990). Some similar results are known for spline spaces of total degree p over general rectilinear partitions, see Chui and Wang (1983), Manni (1992) and references therein.Among the various techniques to tackle the dimension problem, one can use the homological approach proposed in Mourrain (2014), where the technique introduced in Billera (1988) and developed in Schenk and Stillman (1997) for polynomial splines over triangulations has been fine-tuned for polynomial splines over planar T-meshes. In this paper we address the problem of finding the dimension of Tchebycheffian spline spaces over planar T-meshes. To this end, we generalize the techniques and the results presented in Mourrain (2014). More precisely, besides characterizing the Tchebycheffian spline space as a suitable homology space,•we provide a dimension formula in terms of combinatorial quantities of the T-mesh, the smoothness, the dimensions of the underlying extended Tchebycheff spaces, and homology quantities;we derive lower and upper bounds for the dimension (under a specific assumption on the underlying extended Tchebycheff spaces);we provide an explicit expression for the (stable) dimension of spline spaces over quasi-cross-cut T-meshes, and of spline spaces withpi≥2ri+1under some mild conditions on the T-mesh; the latter conditions are usually satisfied by T-meshes of interest in applications and identify a family of T-meshes larger than the one considered in Mourrain (2014);we illustrate that the dimension of Tchebycheffian spline spaces over T-meshes can be unstable, by generalizing the examples given in Li and Chen (2011).As mentioned above, this paper is a generalization of Mourrain (2014) from the polynomial spline setting to the Tchebycheffian spline setting, and the reading of this paper should go hand in hand with the reading of Mourrain (2014). Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that the extension is non-trivial because the ring structure of algebraic polynomials cannot be used anymore in this general setting. Besides the stated results on the dimension, this new interpretation of the approach in Mourrain (2014) is an additional contribution of the paper and it strengthens the structural similarity between algebraic polynomial and general Tchebycheffian spline spaces.We recall that generalized spline spaces are a special class of Tchebycheffian spline spaces. Results on the dimension of generalized spline spaces over T-meshes have been provided in Bracco and Roman (2016) by extending the approach based on so-called minimal determining sets, see Schumaker and Wang (2012). The homological approach for the dimension problem has been considered in Bracco et al. (2016) in the case of generalized spline spaces over T-meshes. More precisely, only the characterization of the dimension in terms of homology quantities has been given in Bracco et al. (2016). To the best of our knowledge, there are no other results about the dimension of Tchebycheffian spline spaces over T-meshes in the literature.The remainder of the paper is divided into five sections. In Section 2 we give the definition of Tchebycheffian spline spaces over T-meshes, and we provide their characterization in terms of the homology of a suitable complex. Section 3 collects several technical results to be used in Section 4 for determining the dimension of the considered Tchebycheffian spline spaces. Examples of instability in the dimension of Tchebycheffian spline spaces over T-meshes are provided in Section 5. Finally, we end in Section 6 with some concluding remarks.In this section we formulate the definitions of the meshes and of the spaces we are dealing with.Let us consider a regionΩ⊂R2which is a finite union of closed axis-aligned rectangles, called cells, with pairwise disjoint interiors. We assume that Ω is simply connected and its interiorΩois connected; see Fig. 2for an illustration. The smallest rectangle containing Ω is denoted by[ah,bh]×[av,bv].We now define a T-mesh on Ω using the notation and definition given in Bracco et al. (2016), Mourrain (2014).Definition 2.1T-meshA T-meshT:=(T2,T1,T0)on Ω is defined as:•T2is the collection of cells in Ω;T1=T1h∪T1vis a finite set of closed axis-aligned horizontal and vertical segments in⋃σ∈T2∂σ, called edges;T0:=⋃τ∈T1∂τis a finite set of points, called vertices;for eachσ∈T2, ∂σ is a finite union of elements ofT1;forσ,σ′∈T2withσ≠σ′,σ∩σ′=∂σ∩∂σ′is a finite union of elements ofT1∪T0;forτ,τ′∈T1withτ≠τ′,τ∩τ′=∂τ∩∂τ′⊂T0;for eachγ∈T0,γ=τh∩τvwhereτhis a horizontal edge andτvis a vertical edge.We denote byT1othe set of interior edges, i.e., the edges intersecting the interior of Ω. Analogously,T0orepresents the set of vertices inΩo, called interior vertices. The elements of the setsT1∖T1oandT0∖T0oare the boundary edges and the boundary vertices, respectively. We say that an interior vertex is a crossing vertex if it belongs to 4 distinct edges; it is a T-vertex if it belongs to exactly 3 edges. Moreover,T1o,handT1o,vindicate the sets of the horizontal and vertical interior edges ofT, respectively, and we setT1o:=T1o,h∪T1o,v. Then, the interior T-mesh is given byTo:=(T2,T1o,T0o).A segment ofTis a connected union of edges ofTbelonging to the same straight line. Given anyτ∈T1o, we denote byρ(τ)the maximal segment composed of edges ofT1ocontaining τ. Moreover, we denote byms(T)the set of all such maximal segments. Ifρ∈ms(T)does not intersect the boundary of the T-mesh, we say that ρ is a maximal interior segment. The set of all horizontal (respectively vertical) maximal interior segments is denoted bymish(T)(respectivelymisv(T)), and we setmis(T):=mish(T)∪misv(T). Given anyγ∈T0o, we defineρh(γ):=ρ(τh)andρv(γ):=ρ(τv), such thatγ=τh∩τvandτh∈T1o,h,τv∈T1o,v.Finally, we denote byf2the number of rectangles, byf1handf1vthe number of horizontal and vertical interior edges, respectively, and byf0the number of interior vertices ofT.Example 2.1Consider the T-meshTdepicted in Fig. 3. In this case, we have•T2={σ1,σ2,σ3,σ4,σ5,σ6,σ7},f2=7;T1o,h={τ1h,τ2h,τ3h,τ4h,τ5h,τ6h,τ7h},f1h=7;T1o,v={τ1v,τ2v,τ3v,τ4v,τ5v,τ6v,τ7v},f1v=7;T0o={γ1,γ2,γ3,γ4,γ5,γ6,γ7,γ8},f0=8;mis(T)={ρ1:=τ4v∪τ5v,ρ2:=τ6v∪τ7v,ρ3:=τ4h}.For some other examples, we refer to Bracco et al. (2016, Section 2). Since we are interested in (non-polynomial) spline spaces over T-meshes where the smoothness of the elements of the space across the edges of the T-mesh is given, we also need to define what we mean by smoothness.Definition 2.2SmoothnessWith each edgeτ∈T1o, we associate an integerr(τ)≥−1. We say thatf∈Cr(τ)(τ)if the partial derivatives of f up to orderr(τ)are continuous across the edge τ. We assume thatr(τ)=r(τ′)for allτ,τ′lying on the same straight line, and we refer to this as the constant smoothness (along lines) assumption. Lettingr:={r(τ),∀τ∈T1o},we callra smoothness distribution onT. We define the following class of smooth functions on Ω:Cr(T):={f:Ω→R:f∈Cr(τ)(τ),∀τ∈T1o}.Given a smoothness distributionronT, with each vertexγ∈T0o, we associate two integersrh(γ),rv(γ), whererh(γ):=r(τv)andrv(γ):=r(τh)such thatγ=τh∩τvandτh∈T1o,h,τv∈T1o,v. Moreover, with each maximal segmentρ∈ms(T), we associate an integerr(ρ):=r(τ), where τ is any interior edge belonging to ρ. Note that the integersrh(γ),rv(γ)andr(ρ)are well defined by the constant smoothness (along lines) assumption.We start by defining extended Tchebycheff spaces on a certain interval (Karlin and Studden, 1966).Definition 2.3Extended Tchebycheff spaceGiven an integerp≥0and an interval J, a spaceTp(J)⊂Cp(J)of dimensionp+1is an extended Tchebycheff space on J if any Hermite interpolation problem withp+1data on J has a unique solution inTp(J). In other words, for any integerm≥1, letx¯1,…,x¯mbe distinct points in J and letd1,…,dmbe integers such thatp+1=∑i=1m(di+1), then for any set{fi,k∈R}k=0,…,di,i=1,…,mthere exists a uniqueq∈Tp(J)such thatDxkq(x¯i)=fi,k,k=0,…,di,i=1,…,m.From the definition it follows that any non-trivial element inTp(J)has at most p roots in J counting multiplicities. It is clear that ifTp(J)is an extended Tchebycheff space, thenTp(J′)is also an extended Tchebycheff space for anyJ′⊂J.Example 2.2The spacePp:=〈1,x,…,xp〉of algebraic polynomials of degree less than or equal to p is an extended Tchebycheff space on the real line.Example 2.3The space of trigonometric functionsE2n:=〈1,sin⁡x,cos⁡x,…,sin⁡(nx),cos⁡(nx)〉is an extended Tchebycheff space on any interval[a,b]with0<n(b−a)<π.Example 2.4The kernel (null space)Lpof a differential operatorLp:=∑i=0p+1ciDxiwith real coefficients andcp+1:=1is an extended Tchebycheff space of dimensionp+1. If the characteristic polynomial has only real roots thenLpis an extended Tchebycheff space on the real line. On the other hand, if some of the roots are not real thenLpis an extended Tchebycheff space on a suitable interval J. Note that the spacePp(see Example 2.2) is a special case withLp=Dxp+1, and also the spaceE2n(see Example 2.3) withL2n=Dx∏j=1n(Dx2+j2I).Example 2.5The spaceGpU,V:=〈1,x,…,xp−2,U(x),V(x)〉is an extended Tchebycheff space on J, under the assumption that〈Dxp−1U(x),Dxp−1V(x)〉is an extended Tchebycheff space on J, see Bracco et al. (2016), Bracco and Roman (2016), Costantini et al. (2005). Noteworthy cases are the spaces•Gp,αexp:=〈1,x,…,xp−2,eαx,e−αx〉,0<α∈R,J=R;Gp,αtrig:=〈1,x,…,xp−2,sin⁡(αx),cos⁡(αx)〉,0<α(b−a)<π,J=[a,b];Gp,nvdp:=〈1,x,…,xp−2,(b−xb−a)n,(x−ab−a)n〉,p≤n,J=(a,b).Extended Tchebycheff spaces are a natural extension of the space of algebraic polynomials, because they enjoy the same structural properties as polynomial spaces. In particular, from Definition 2.3 it follows that for anyx¯∈Jthe extended Tchebycheff spaceTp(J)admits a Taylor-like basis{ψx¯,i}i=0psuch thatDxkψx¯,i(x¯)=δik,k=0,…,p,i=0,…,p,whereδikstands for the classical Kronecker delta.In the following, we denote by ℓ either h or v. Letpℓ∈Nwithpℓ≥0, and letTpℓℓ([aℓ,bℓ])be an extended Tchebycheff space of dimensionpℓ+1on[aℓ,bℓ]. Then, we define the tensor-product space(2.1)PpT:=Tphh([ah,bh])⊗Tpvv([av,bv]),wherep:=(ph,pv)andT:=(Th,Tv):=(Tphh,Tpvv). If the space (2.1) is the space of bivariate algebraic polynomials of bi-degreep, then it will be denoted byPp. We are now ready to define the Tchebycheffian spline space over a T-mesh.Definition 2.4Tchebycheffian spline space over a T-meshLetTbe a T-mesh with a smoothness distributionr, and letph,pv∈Nwithph,pv≥0. We define the space of Tchebycheffian splines over the T-meshT, denoted bySpT,r(T), as the space of functions inCr(T)such that, restricted to any cellσ∈T2, they belong toPpT, i.e.,SpT,r(T):={s∈Cr(T):s|σ∈PpT,σ∈T2}.In particular, in the case of bivariate algebraic polynomials,Spr(T):={s∈Cr(T):s|σ∈Pp,σ∈T2}.Note that, sinceTphhis an extended Tchebycheff space, if the smoothnessr(τv)≥phassociated with a vertical edgeτv∈T1o,vthen for any two cellsσ,σ′adjacent toτvwe haves|σ∪σ′∈PpT,s∈SpT,r(T).A similar property holds for horizontal edges. Therefore, in the following we assumer(τv)<ph,∀τv∈T1o,v,r(τh)<pv,∀τh∈T1o,h.In this section we describe an alternative characterization of the spline spaceSpT,r(T)which will play a fundamental role in our analysis of the dimension ofSpT,r(T). This characterization is based on a homological approach similar to the one used in Bracco et al. (2016), Mourrain (2014). To this end, we first recall the definition of complex and homology.Definition 2.5i-HomologyA complexAis a sequence of objects and morphismsA:⋯→Ai+1→δi+1Ai→δiAi−1⋯whereimδi+1⊆ker⁡δi. The i-homology ofAis defined asHi(A):=ker⁡δi/imδi+1. The complex is exact at position i ifHi(A)=0.We now define some subspaces ofPpTthat will be used in the alternative characterization ofSpT,r(T)as the kernel of a suitable linear map. For each vertical edge τ ofTwe consider the following subspace ofPpT:(2.2)IpT,r(τ):={q∈PpT:Dxkq(x¯,y)≡0,∀y∈[av,bv],k=0,…,r(τ)},wherex¯is the abscissa of any point of τ. Analogously, for each horizontal edge τ we set(2.3)IpT,r(τ):={q∈PpT:Dylq(x,y¯)≡0,∀x∈[ah,bh],l=0,…,r(τ)},wherey¯is the ordinate of any point of τ. Moreover, for each vertexγ:=(x¯,y¯)we define the subspace(2.4)IpT,r(γ):={q∈PpT:DxkDylq(x¯,y¯)≡0,k=0,…,rh(γ),l=0,…,rv(γ)}.As done in Mourrain (2014) in the algebraic polynomial case, we define the following complexes, see also Billera (1988), Bracco et al. (2016), Spanier (1966):(2.5)00↓↓IpT,r(To):0→∂ˆ2⨁τ∈T1oIpT,r(τ)→∂ˆ1⨁γ∈T0oIpT,r(γ)→∂ˆ00↓↓↓PpT(To):0→∂3⨁σ∈T2PpT→∂2⨁τ∈T1oPpT→∂1⨁γ∈T0oPpT→∂00↓↓↓SpT,r(To):0→∂¯3⨁σ∈T2PpT→∂¯2⨁τ∈T1oPpT/IpT,r(τ)→∂¯1⨁γ∈T0oPpT/IpT,r(γ)→∂¯00↓↓↓000The maps of the complexPpT(To)are induced by the usual boundary maps, so they are defined as follows. We consider all the edgesτ∈T1oriented, and we use the notationτ=[γ1γ2], whereγ1,γ2∈T0. The opposite edge is denoted by[γ2γ1], and by convention we set[γ1γ2]=−[γ2γ1].•The map∂3is the identity map.The map∂2:⨁σ∈T2PpT→⨁τ∈T1oPpTis given by∂2(q):=⨁τ∈T1o∑σ∈S(τ)qσ,q∈⨁σ∈T2PpT,where, for eachτ∈T1o,S(τ)is the set of cells inT2which contain τ, and for each cellσ∈T2, whose counterclockwise boundary is formed by the edgesτ1=[γ1γ2],…,τl=[γlγ1],qσis the component of q associated with the cell σ if the boundary of σ contains τ and its opposite if the boundary of σ contains the opposite of τ.The map∂1:⨁τ∈T1oPpT→⨁γ∈T0oPpTis given by∂1(q):=⨁γ∈T0o∑τ∈E(γ)qτ,q∈⨁τ∈T1oPpT,where, for eachγ∈T0o,E(γ)is the set of edges inT1owhich have γ as one of the endpoints, and, for each oriented edgeτ=[γ1γ2]∈T1o,qτis the component of q associated with τ ifγ=γ2and its opposite ifγ=γ1.For eachq∈⨁γ∈T0oPpT,∂0(q):=0.The maps of the complexIpT,r(To), denoted by∂ˆ2,∂ˆ1and∂ˆ0, are obtained from∂2,∂1and∂0by restriction. Indeed, for eachτ∈T1oandγ∈T0o, an elementqτofIpT,r(τ)also belongs toIpT,r(γ), provided that the edge τ has an endpoint in γ, and therefore∑τ∈E(γ)qτbelongs toIpT,r(γ)as well. As a consequence, the image of the restriction of∂1to⨁τ∈T1oIpT,r(τ)is included in⨁γ∈T0oIpT,r(γ).The maps ofSpT,r(To), denoted by∂¯2,∂¯1and∂¯0, are naturally induced since the considered vector spaces are quotients of the ones ofPpT(To).Note that, by construction, we have∂ˆi∘∂ˆi+1=0,∂i∘∂i+1=0,∂¯i∘∂¯i+1=0,i=0,1.The vertical maps in each column of the diagram in (2.5) are the inclusion and the quotient map, respectively.We will now study the homology of the complexes in (2.5). Our interest is motivated by the fact that the homology of the cells inSpT,r(To)is related to the spaceSpT,r(T). More precisely, we have the following proposition. Its proof is completely analogous to the proof of Bracco et al. (2016, Proposition 1) which extends the result in Mourrain (2014, Proposition 2.9).Proposition 2.1For the complexSpT,r(To)in(2.5), we have(2.6)H2(SpT,r(To))=ker⁡∂¯2=SpT,r(T).In order to determine the dimension of the spaceSpT,r(T), we can consider the Euler characteristic of the complexSpT,r(To):0→∂¯3⨁σ∈T2PpT→∂¯2⨁τ∈T1oPpT/IpT,r(τ)→∂¯1⨁γ∈T0oPpT/IpT,r(γ)→∂¯00,namelydim⁡(⨁σ∈T2PpT)−dim⁡(⨁τ∈T1oPpT/IpT,r(τ))+dim⁡(⨁γ∈T0oPpT/IpT,r(γ))=dim⁡(H2(SpT,r(To)))−dim⁡(H1(SpT,r(To)))+dim⁡(H0(SpT,r(To))).Taking into account the equality (2.6) we get the relation(2.7)dim⁡(SpT,r(T))=dim⁡(⨁σ∈T2PpT)−dim⁡(⨁τ∈T1oPpT/IpT,r(τ))+dim⁡(⨁γ∈T0oPpT/IpT,r(γ))+dim⁡(H1(SpT,r(To)))−dim⁡(H0(SpT,r(To))).In the next section we will investigate the different terms in (2.7). Afterwards, in Section 4 we will give combinatorial lower and upper bounds for the dimension ofSpT,r(T), and we show that these bounds coincide in some special cases.In this section we study in more detail the terms in the formula (2.7). Our arguments are based on homological techniques, extending the ones used in Mourrain (2014) for investigating the dimension of the spaceSpr(T). First, we address the three terms in (2.7) related to the section spacePpT, and then we investigate the two homology terms in (2.7).We now analyze the subspaces ofPpTappearing in the dimension formula (2.7). The next proposition extends the results in Mourrain (2014, Lemma 1.5) and Bracco et al. (2016, Lemma 1) to the Tchebycheffian setting.Proposition 3.1The following dimension formulas hold:1.dim⁡(PpT)=(ph+1)(pv+1);dim⁡(PpT/IpT,r(τ))={(ph+1)(r(τ)+1),τhorizontal(r(τ)+1)(pv+1),τvertical;dim⁡(PpT/IpT,r(γ))=(rh(γ)+1)(rv(γ)+1).Proving the first formula is trivial. In order to prove the second formula, we note that a general element ofPpTcan be written as(3.1)q(x,y)=∑i=0ph∑j=0pvai,jψx¯,ih(x)ψy¯,jv(y),where{ψx¯,ih}i=0phand{ψy¯,jv}j=0pvare Taylor-like bases of the spacesTphhandTpvv, respectively, such thatDxkψx¯,ih(x¯)=δik,k=0,…,ph,i=0,…,ph,Dylψy¯,jv(y¯)=δjl,l=0,…,pv,j=0,…,pv.Let us assume that τ is vertical wherex¯is its abscissa (the proof for τ horizontal is analogous). An element belonging toIpT,r(τ)must then satisfy the conditions0=Dxkq(x¯,y)=∑i=0ph∑j=0pvai,jDxkψx¯,ih(x¯)ψy¯,jv(y)=∑j=0pvak,jψy¯,jv(y),k=0,…,r(τ),for somey¯∈[av,bv]and for ally∈[av,bv]. This implies thatak,j=0fork=0,…,r(τ)andj=0,…,pv. As a consequence,(3.2)dim⁡(IpT,r(τ))=(ph+1)(pv+1)−(r(τ)+1)(pv+1).Then,dim⁡(PpT/IpT,r(τ))=dim⁡(PpT)−dim⁡(IpT,r(τ))=(r(τ)+1)(pv+1). Finally, we prove the third item of the lemma. Let us assume that(x¯,y¯)are the coordinates of γ. An element belonging toIpT,r(γ)can be expressed in the form (3.1) and must satisfy the following conditions0=DxkDylq(x¯,y¯)=∑i=0ph∑j=0pvai,jDxkψx¯,ih(x¯)Dylψy¯,jv(y¯)=ak,l,k=0,…,rh(γ),l=0,…,rv(γ),which means thatdim⁡(IpT,r(γ))=(ph+1)(pv+1)−(rh(γ)+1)(rv(γ)+1).Then, sincedim⁡(PpT/IpT,r(γ))=dim⁡(PpT)−dim⁡(IpT,r(γ)), the proof is complete.  □Consider an extended Tchebycheff spaceTp(J)of dimensionp+1on J. Givend∈Nandx¯∈J, we define(3.3)IpT,d(x¯):={q∈Tp(J):Dxkq(x¯)=0,k=0,…,d},whereT:=Tp. We remark that•IpT,r(τh)=Tphh⊗IpvTv,r(τh)(y¯), ifτhis a horizontal edge andy¯is the ordinate of any point ofτh;IpT,r(τv)=IphTh,r(τv)(x¯)⊗Tpvv, ifτvis a vertical edge andx¯is the abscissa of any point ofτv;IpT,r(γ)=IpT,r(τh)+IpT,r(τv)if γ is a vertex such thatγ=τh∩τv.Definition 3.1d-Sum propertyConsider an extended Tchebycheff spaceTp(J)of dimensionp+1on J. Letd:=(d1,…,dm)with0≤di≤p,di∈N,i=1,…,m. We say thatTp(J)has thed-sum property if for any set of m distinct pointsx¯1,…,x¯m∈Jwe have(3.4)dim⁡(∑i=1mIpT,di(x¯i))=min⁡(p+1,∑i=1mp−di),whereIpT,di(x¯i)is defined in (3.3).Example 3.1The space of algebraic polynomialsPphas thed-sum property for anyd:=(d1,…,dm)with0≤di≤p,di∈N,i=1,…,mand for anym∈N; see Mourrain (2014, Proposition 1.8).Proposition 3.2Consider an extended Tchebycheff spaceTp(J)of dimensionp+1on J. Letd:=(d1,…,dm)with0≤di≤p,di∈N,i=1,…,m. It holds:•ifm=1, thenTp(J)has the d-sum property;ifp≥dk+dl+1for at least a pairk,l∈{1,…,m}, thenTp(J)has the d-sum property.The first item immediately follows from Definition 2.3. Let us now prove the second item, for which it suffices to considerm≥2. From the Grassmann formula for the dimension of vector spaces we deducedim⁡(∑i=1mIpT,di(x¯i))≥dim⁡(IpT,dk(x¯k)+IpT,dl(x¯l))=dim⁡(IpT,dk(x¯k))+dim⁡(IpT,dl(x¯l))−dim⁡(IpT,dk(x¯k)∩IpT,dl(x¯l)).Moreover, from Definition 2.3 we getdim⁡(IpT,di(x¯i))=p−di,dim⁡(IpT,dk(x¯k)∩IpT,dl(x¯l))=(p+1−(dk+1)−(dl+1))+=(p−dk−dl−1)+,where(x)+:=max⁡(x,0). Sincep≥dk+dl+1, we deducep+1≥dim⁡(∑i=1mIpT,di(x¯i))≥(p−dk)+(p−dl)−(p−dk−dl−1)=p+1.This gives the value in (3.4) fordim⁡(∑i=1mIpT,di(x¯i)).  □Inspired by the polynomial case (see Example 3.1), we make the following conjecture.Conjecture 3.1Any extended complete Tchebycheff spaceTp(J)has the d-sum property for anyd:=(d1,…,dm)with0≤di≤p,di∈N,i=1,…,mand for anym∈N. For the formal definition of an extended complete Tchebycheff space we refer toSchumaker (2007, Chapter 9).In Proposition 3.3 we address the exactness ofPpT(To). These results can be proved with the same line of arguments as considered in Mourrain (2014) to prove Propositions D.1–D.3 for the algebraic polynomial case. Their proofs are just based on general properties of complexes and on the topological features of the T-mesh. For this reason, we omit the corresponding technical proofs.Proposition 3.3For the complexPpT,r(To)in(2.5), we haveH0(PpT(To))=0,H1(PpT(To))=0,H2(PpT(To))=PpT.The next proposition extends Mourrain (2014, Lemma 2.2 and Proposition 2.7) to the case of Tchebycheffian splines. Their proofs are again based on general properties of complexes and on the topological features of the T-mesh, just like in Mourrain (2014); therefore we omit them.Proposition 3.4For the complexesSpT,r(To),PpT,r(To)andIpT,r(To)in(2.5), we haveH0(SpT,r(To))=H0(PpT(To))=0;H1(SpT,r(To))=H0(IpT,r(To)).From Proposition 3.4 and the formula in (2.7) we notice that it is important to study more in detailH0(IpT,r(To))and its dimension. In the remainder of this section we will address this point.For anyγ:=(x¯,y¯)∈T0o, letEh(γ)andEv(γ)be the sets of horizontal and vertical interior edges containing γ. We also setE(γ):=Eh(γ)∪Ev(γ). Moreover, letPh(γ)andPv(γ)be the sets of pairs(τ,τ′)of horizontal and vertical interior edges containing γ, andP(γ):=Ph(γ)∪Pv(γ). We now define the map(3.5)ϕγT:⨁τ∈E(γ)IpT,r(τ)⟶IpT,r(γ),which relates an elementq∈⨁τ∈E(γ)IpT,r(τ)with the elementϕγT(q)∈IpT,r(γ)identified byϕγT(q):=∑τ∈E(γ)qτ,whereqτstands for the component of q associated with the edge τ. In the polynomial case we denote this map by(3.6)ϕγ:⨁τ∈E(γ)Ipr(τ)⟶Ipr(γ),for which the following proposition has been proved in Mourrain (2014, Proposition 2.3). Note that in Mourrain (2014) the corresponding map (denoted byφγ) is defined on a set isomorphic to⨁τ∈E(γ)Ipr(τ).Proposition 3.5For the mapϕγin(3.6), we haveker⁡ϕγ=∑(τ,τ′)∈P(γ)Kτ,τ′+∑τ∈Eh(γ),τ′∈Ev(γ)Kτ,τ′,whereKτ,τ′:={q∈⨁τ˜∈E(γ)Ipr(τ˜):qτ=−qτ′andqτ˜=0for eachτ˜∉{τ,τ′}}.We will now prove an analogous proposition for the case of extended Tchebycheff spaces.Proposition 3.6For the mapϕγTin(3.5), we haveker⁡ϕγT=∑(τ,τ′)∈P(γ)Kτ,τ′T+∑τ∈Eh(γ),τ′∈Ev(γ)Kτ,τ′T,whereKτ,τ′T:={q∈⨁τ˜∈E(γ)IpT,r(τ˜):qτ=−qτ′andqτ˜=0for eachτ˜∉{τ,τ′}}.We first recall thatγ:=(x¯,y¯). Let{ψx¯,ih}i=0phand{ψy¯,jv}j=0pvbe Taylor-like bases of the spacesTphhandTpvv, respectively. Then, we can write every componentqτof anyq∈⨁τ∈E(γ)IpT,r(τ)in the form (3.1). More precisely,qτ=∑j=r(τ)+1pvψy¯,jv(y)∑i=0phαi,jτψx¯,ih(x)ifτ∈Eh(γ),andqτ=∑i=r(τ)+1phψx¯,ih(x)∑j=0pvαi,jτψy¯,jv(y)ifτ∈Ev(γ).As a consequence, we haveϕγT(q)=∑i=0ph∑j=0pv∑τ∈E(γ)αi,jτψx¯,ih(x)ψy¯,jv(y),takingαi,jτ:=0forj=0,…,r(τ),τ∈Eh(γ), andαi,jτ:=0fori=0,…,r(τ),τ∈Ev(γ). Therefore, an element belongs toker⁡ϕγTif and only if it satisfies(3.7)DxkDyl(ϕγT(q))(x¯,y¯)=∑τ∈Ev(γ)αk,lτ=0,k>rh(γ),l≤rv(γ),(3.8)DxkDyl(ϕγT(q))(x¯,y¯)=∑τ∈Eh(γ)αk,lτ=0,k≤rh(γ),l>rv(γ),(3.9)DxkDyl(ϕγT(q))(x¯,y¯)=∑τ∈E(γ)αk,lτ=0,k>rh(γ),l>rv(γ).From its definition it is clear that any element ofKτ,τ′Tsatisfies the conditions in (3.7)–(3.9). It follows that any element of∑(τ,τ′)∈P(γ)Kτ,τ′T+∑τ∈Eh(γ),τ′∈Ev(γ)Kτ,τ′Tsatisfies these conditions as well, and that this set is included inker⁡ϕγT. Hence, it is sufficient to prove that(3.10)ker⁡ϕγT⊆∑(τ,τ′)∈P(γ)Kτ,τ′T+∑τ∈Eh(γ),τ′∈Ev(γ)Kτ,τ′T.Suppose nowq∈⨁τ∈E(γ)IpT,r(τ)satisfying (3.7)–(3.9). Moreover, suppose γ is a crossing vertex withEh(γ)={τ1,τ2}andEv(γ)={τ3,τ4}. Then, we can decompose q asq=qP+qE,where the coefficients ofqPare given byαi,jP,τk:=αi,jτk,k=1,2,3,4,i≤rh(γ)orj≤rv(γ),αi,jP,τ1:=−αi,jτ2,αi,jP,τ2:=αi,jτ2,αi,jP,τ3:=−αi,jτ4,αi,jP,τ4:=αi,jτ4,i>rh(γ)andj>rv(γ),and the coefficients ofqEare given byαi,jE,τk:=0,k=1,2,3,4,i≤rh(γ)orj≤rv(γ),αi,jE,τ1:=αi,jτ1+αi,jτ2,αi,jE,τ2:=0,αi,jE,τ3:=αi,jτ3+αi,jτ4,αi,jE,τ4:=0,i>rh(γ)andj>rv(γ).We see thatqP∈Kτ1,τ2T+Kτ3,τ4Tbecause (3.7)–(3.8) hold and soαi,jτ1=−αi,jτ2andαi,jτ3=−αi,jτ4. Moreover,qE∈Kτ1,τ3Tbecause (3.9) holds and soαi,jτ1+αi,jτ2=−αi,jτ3−αi,jτ4. This means thatq∈Kτ1,τ2T+Kτ3,τ4T+Kτ1,τ3T, and we may conclude that (3.10) holds for a crossing vertex γ. A similar argument can be applied when γ is a T-vertex.  □Note that, for each elementq∈Kτ,τ′Tandγ:=(x¯,y¯), we haveDxkDylqτ˜(x¯,y¯)=0,l≤rv(γ)ifτ˜∈{τ,τ′}=Eh(γ),DxkDylqτ˜(x¯,y¯)=0,k≤rh(γ)ifτ˜∈{τ,τ′}=Ev(γ),DxkDylqτ˜(x¯,y¯)=0,k≤rh(γ)orl≤rv(γ)ifτ˜∈{τ,τ′},τ∈Eh(γ),τ′∈Ev(γ).By exploiting the analogy between Propositions 3.5 and 3.6, the following result can be obtained as a direct generalization of Mourrain (2014, Proposition 2.4).Proposition 3.7For the complexIpT,r(To)in(2.5), we haveH0(IpT,r(To))=(⨁γ∈T0o⨁τ∈E(γ)IpT,r(τ))/(∑(τ,τ′)∈P(γ),γ∈T0oKτ,τ′,γT+∑τ∈Eh(γ),τ′∈Ev(γ),γ∈T0oKτ,τ′,γT+∑τ=(γ,γ′)∈T1oKτ,γ,γ′T),whereKτ,τ′,γT:={q∈⨁γ˜∈T0o⨁τ˜∈E(γ˜)IpT,r(τ˜):qγ,τ=−qγ,τ′andqγ˜,τ˜=0for each(γ˜,τ˜)∉{(γ,τ),(γ,τ′)}},Kτ,γ,γ′T:={q∈⨁γ˜∈T0o⨁τ˜∈E(γ˜)IpT,r(τ˜):qγ,τ=−qγ′,τifγ,γ′∈T0oandqτ˜,γ˜=0for each(γ˜,τ˜)∉{(γ,τ),(γ′,τ)}},and whereqγ,τstands for the component of q associated with the vertex γ and the edge τ.We can further simplify the expression ofH0(IpT,r(To))by using the concept of maximal interior segments. The next proposition generalizes Mourrain (2014, Proposition 2.5) and can be proved with the same line of arguments by taking into account the analogy between Proposition 3.7 and Mourrain (2014, Proposition 2.4).Proposition 3.8For the complexIpT,r(To)in(2.5), we haveH0(IpT,r(To))=(⨁ρ∈mis(T)IpT,r(ρ))/(∑γ∈T0oKγT),whereIpT,r(ρ):=IpT,r(τ)for anyτ⊆ρ,KγT:={q∈⨁ρ∈mis(T)IpT,r(ρ):∃q˜∈K˜γTsuch thatqρ=q˜ρfor eachρ},K˜γT:={q˜∈⨁ρ∈ms(T)IpT,r(ρ):q˜ρh(γ)=−q˜ρv(γ)andq˜ρ=0for eachρ∉{ρh(γ),ρv(γ)}},and whereqρstands for the component of q associated with the maximal segment ρ.Example 3.2Consider the T-meshTin Fig. 3, and the constant smoothnessr(τ)=1for everyτ∈T1o. Moreover, letT=(P2,P2), soph=pv=2. Then, the spaceKγTforγ8,γ3,γ2is given, respectively, by•Kγ8T={(0,0,0)};Kγ3T={(a(x−x2)2(y−y3)2,0,0):a∈R};Kγ2T={(a(x−x2)2(y−y2)2,0,−a(x−x2)2(y−y2)2):a∈R}.We are now going to bounddim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))for general T-meshes (see Theorem 3.1). Let ι be a given ordering ofmis(T). For anyρ∈mis(T), we denote byΓι(ρ)the set of vertices of ρ which do not belong toρ′∈mis(T)withι(ρ′)>ι(ρ). The cardinality of such a set is denoted byλι(ρ).Definition 3.2Weight of MISGiven an ordering ι ofmis(T), the weight of a maximal interior segmentρ∈mis(T)is defined asωι(ρ):={∑γ∈Γι(ρ)(ph−rh(γ)),ifρ∈mish(T)∑γ∈Γι(ρ)(pv−rv(γ)),ifρ∈misv(T).Example 3.3Consider the T-meshTin Fig. 3 and Example 2.1. The ordering ι ofmis(T)is given byι(ρj)=j,j=1,2,3. In this case, we haveΓι(ρ1)={γ1,γ3},Γι(ρ2)={γ4,γ6},Γι(ρ3)={γ2,γ5},soλι(ρ1)=λι(ρ2)=λι(ρ3)=2. Moreover, letph=pv=2and letrh(γ)=rv(γ)=1for everyγ∈T0o. Then, the corresponding weights of the maximal interior segments areωι(ρ1)=ωι(ρ2)=ωι(ρ3)=2(2−1)=2.Indeed,pℓ−rℓ(γ)=2−1=1for everyρ∈misℓ(T),ℓ=h,v.Definition 3.3r-Sum property onTGiven a smoothness distributionronT, we say thatT:=(Tphh,Tpvv)has ther-sum property onT, if each of its componentsTpℓℓ([aℓ,bℓ])withℓ=h,vhas thed-sum property (see Definition 3.1) for any subvectordof the vectorrℓ:=(rℓ(γ))γ∈T0o.In the next theorem we give bounds for the dimension ofH0(IpT,r(To)). Its proof makes use of the characterization of the space provided in Proposition 3.8, and is a slightly reformulated version of the proof in Mourrain (2014, Theorem 3.7).Theorem 3.1Let ι be a given ordering ofmis(T), and assume that T has the r-sum property onT. We have0≤dim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))≤∑ρ∈mish(T)(ph+1−ωι(ρ))+(pv−r(ρ))+∑ρ∈misv(T)(ph−r(ρ))(pv+1−ωι(ρ))+,where(x)+:=max⁡(x,0).The lower bound is trivial, so we just focus on the upper bound. Letρ1,…,ρNbe the maximal interior segments ofTwhere the indices are ordered according to the given ordering ι.Any elementq∈⨁ρ∈mis(T)IpT,r(ρ)=:RTcan be seen as a vector(qρ1,…,qρN)whereqρi∈IpT,r(ρi). Note that the spaceKγTdefined in Proposition 3.8 is a subspace ofRTconsisting of the elements q whose components satisfy the following conditions:•ifγ=(x¯,y¯)is the intersection of the maximal interior segmentsρiandρj, thenqρ=0for eachρ∉{ρi,ρj},andqρi=−qρj,DxkDylqρi(x¯,y¯)=DxkDylqρj(x¯,y¯)=0,0≤k≤rh(γ)or0≤l≤rv(γ);ifγ=(x¯,y¯)is the intersection of the maximal interior segmentρiwith a maximal segment intersecting ∂Ω, thenqρ=0for eachρ≠ρi,DxkDylqρi(x¯,y¯)=0,0≤k≤rh(γ)or0≤l≤rv(γ).For anyq∈RT, we defineF(q)as the element inRThaving all zero components exceptqρimax, which is the component of q with the maximal index such thatqρi≠0. LetF(KT)be the space spanned by{F(q):q∈KT}whereKT:=∑γ∈T0oKγT. It is clear thatdim⁡(F(KT))≤dim⁡(KT), so by Proposition 3.8 we have(3.11)dim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))=dim⁡(RT/KT)≤dim⁡(RT/F(KT)).Moreover, for eachρi∈mis(T), the spaceF(KT)contains the vectors(3.12)(0,…,0,…,0,qρi,0,…,0),↑↑jiwhereqρisatisfies(3.13)DxkDylqρi(x¯,y¯)=0,0≤k≤rh(γ)or0≤l≤rv(γ),for someγ=(x¯,y¯)∈Γ(ρi). Note that γ is either the intersection of the maximal interior segmentsρiandρjwithi>jor the intersection of the maximal interior segmentρiwith a maximal segment intersecting ∂Ω. LetQibe the space spanned by the vectors of the form (3.12)–(3.13). More precisely, ifρi∈mish(T)belongs to the liney=y¯thenQi={q∈⨁ρ∈mis(T)IpT,r(ρi):qρ=0ifρ≠ρiandqρi(x,y)∈Qˆi},whereQˆi:=(∑γ=(x¯,y¯)∈Γ(ρi)IpTh,rh(γ)(x¯))⊗IpTv,rv(γ)(y¯).A similar characterization holds ifρi∈misv(T). As a consequence, by Definition 3.1, the dimension ofQiis given bydim⁡(Qi)=dim⁡(Qˆi)={min⁡(ph+1,ωι(ρi))(pv−r(ρi)),ifρi∈mish(T)min⁡(pv+1,ωι(ρi))(ph−r(ρi)),ifρi∈misv(T),and from (3.2) we get(3.14)dim⁡(IpT,r(ρi)/Qˆi)={(ph+1−ωι(ρ))+(pv−r(ρi)),ifρi∈mish(T)(ph−r(ρi))(pv+1−ωι(ρ))+,ifρi∈misv(T).Since∑i=1NQi⊆F(KT)anddim⁡(∑i=1NQi)=∑i=1Ndim⁡(Qi), we obtain(3.15)dim⁡(RT/F(KT))≤dim⁡((⨁ρ∈mis(T)IpT,r(ρ))/(∑i=1NQi))=∑i=1Ndim⁡(IpT,r(ρi)/Qˆi).By combining (3.11) and (3.15), we arrive at the upper bound fordim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))by taking into account (3.14).  □In this section we address the dimension problem in case of Tchebycheffian spline spaces over T-meshes. First, we state a general dimension formula involving a homology term, and we give a lower and upper bound. Then, we consider certain conditions on the T-mesh and/or the Tchebycheffian spline space so that the homology term vanishes.Using the results in the previous sections, we are able to state a general dimension formula for any Tchebycheffian spline spaceSpT,r(T)defined over a T-meshT.Theorem 4.1We have(4.1)dim⁡(SpT,r(T))=∑σ∈T2(ph+1)(pv+1)−∑τ∈T1o,h(ph+1)(r(τ)+1)−∑τ∈T1o,v(r(τ)+1)(pv+1)+∑γ∈T0o(rh(γ)+1)(rv(γ)+1)+dim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To))).By combining Propositions 3.1 and 3.4 with the equality (2.7), we arrive at the formula (4.1).  □Sincedim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))≥0, we immediately get the same lower bound for the dimension ofSpT,r(T)as in the algebraic polynomial case, see Mourrain (2014, Section 3):(4.2)dim⁡(SpT,r(T))≥∑σ∈T2(ph+1)(pv+1)−∑τ∈T1o,h(ph+1)(r(τ)+1)−∑τ∈T1o,v(r(τ)+1)(pv+1)+∑γ∈T0o(rh(γ)+1)(rv(γ)+1).Moreover, given an ordering ι ofmis(T), from Theorem 3.1 we also obtain an upper bound for the dimension ofSpT,r(T), under the assumption thatThas ther-sum property onT:(4.3)dim⁡(SpT,r(T))≤∑σ∈T2(ph+1)(pv+1)−∑τ∈T1o,h(ph+1)(r(τ)+1)−∑τ∈T1o,v(r(τ)+1)(pv+1)+∑γ∈T0o(rh(γ)+1)(rv(γ)+1)+∑ρ∈mish(T)(ph+1−ωι(ρ))+(pv−r(ρ))+∑ρ∈misv(T)(ph−r(ρ))(pv+1−ωι(ρ))+.We say that a smoothness distributionronTis constant if there existμ:=(μh,μv)such that(4.4)r(τv)=μh,∀τv∈T1o,v,r(τh)=μv,∀τh∈T1o,h.Example 4.1Given a T-meshTwith a constant smoothness distributionras in (4.4), the dimension formula (4.1) simplifies to(4.5)dim⁡(SpT,r(T))=(ph+1)(pv+1)f2−(ph+1)(μv+1)f1h−(μh+1)(pv+1)f1v+(μh+1)(μv+1)f0+dim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To))).The formula (4.5) corresponds to the formula found in Mourrain (2014) for the algebraic polynomial spline space defined on the same T-mesh. In this case, the homology term can be bounded as0≤dim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))≤∑ρ∈mish(T)(ph+1−(ph−μh)λι(ρ))+(pv−μv)+∑ρ∈misv(T)(ph−μh)(pv+1−(pv−μv)λι(ρ))+,under the assumption thatThas ther-sum property onT.Under certain conditions on the T-mesh and/or the Tchebycheffian spline space, the homology term in the dimension formula (4.1) is zero, so that the dimension ofSpT,r(T)agrees with the lower bound in (4.2). In the following we discuss some noteworthy cases and examples. The first is a direct consequence of Proposition 3.8.Corollary 4.1If the T-meshThas no maximal interior segments, thendim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))=0.Note that a T-mesh with no maximal interior segments is a so-called quasi-cross-cut partition of the domain Ω (see, e.g., Chui and Wang, 1983). Indeed, in such a T-mesh each edgeτ∈T1oextends to the boundary ∂Ω. An edge that extends to the boundary is referred to as a pseudo-boundary edge in Schenk and Stillman (1997).Example 4.2LetTbe a tensor-product mesh defined on the domain[ah,bh]×[av,bv]by the partitionsah=x0<⋯<xk+1=bhandav=y0<⋯<yl+1=bv. One can easily check that there are no maximal interior segments. As a consequence, the dimension ofSpT,r(T)agrees with the lower bound in (4.2). For instance, taking a constant smoothness distributionras in (4.4), the dimension formula (4.5) simplifies todim⁡(SpT,r(T))=((ph+1)(k+1)−k(μh+1))((pv+1)(l+1)−l(μv+1)).In the algebraic polynomial context, it is known (see Mourrain, 2014; Schumaker and Wang, 2012) that if the degree is large enough with respect to the smoothness, then the dimension ofSpr(T)agrees with the lower bound in (4.2). This extends to the setting of Tchebycheffian splines, as stated in Corollary 4.2 and Corollary 4.3. To this end, we recall, respectively from Mourrain (2014) and Schumaker and Wang (2012), the concepts of hierarchical T-mesh and cycle. Note that the former is also referred to as LR-mesh in Bracco et al. (2016), Dokken et al. (2013). In addition, we define the concept of cycle of MIS.Definition 4.1Hierarchical T-meshA hierarchical T-mesh is either an axis-aligned rectangular domain Ω or a T-mesh obtained by splitting a cell of another hierarchical T-mesh along a vertical or horizontal line.Definition 4.2CycleA segment ϱ of a T-mesh is called a composite edge if all the vertices lying in its interior are T-vertices and if it cannot be extended to a longer segment with the same property. A sequenceϱ1,…,ϱnof composite edges in a T-mesh is said to form a cycle if eachϱihas one of its endpoints in the interior ofϱi+1(we assumeϱn+1:=ϱ1).Definition 4.3Cycle of MISA sequenceρ1,…,ρnof maximal interior segments in a T-mesh is said to form a cycle of MIS if eachρihas one of its endpoints in the interior ofρi+1(we assumeρn+1:=ρ1).The above three definitions lead to three different families of T-meshes: the family of hierarchical T-meshes, the family of T-meshes without cycles, and the family of T-meshes without cycles of MIS.Remark 4.1The families of T-meshes without cycles and of T-meshes without cycles of MIS do not coincide and none of them includes the other. In fact, there are T-meshes having no cycles of MIS but having cycles, and vice versa (see Fig. 4). On the other hand, the family of hierarchical T-meshes is strictly included in both the family of T-meshes without cycles and the family of T-meshes without cycles of MIS. The T-mesh in Fig. 4(a) has no cycles of MIS and is not hierarchical; the T-mesh in Fig. 4(b) has no cycles and is not hierarchical as well.We observe that a T-meshTwithout cycles of MIS allows us to define an ordering ι ofmis(T)such thatρ,ρ′∈mis(T)with ρ having one endpoint in the interior ofρ′implies thatι(ρ′)<ι(ρ). For instance, the ordering ofmis(T)in Example 3.3 satisfies this condition. The following algorithm generates such an ordering.Algorithm 4.1Given a T-meshTwithout cycles of MIS, the ordering ι ofmis(T)is constructed as follows. InitializeA=mis(T)andB=∅. Then, repeat as long asAis not empty:1.select anyρ∈Asuch that for each endpoint of ρ belonging toρ′∈mis(T)we requireρ′∈B;setι(ρ)=n+1with n the cardinality of the setB;remove ρ from the setAand insert it in the setB.It is clear that the algorithm starts the ordering by selecting a maximal interior segment whose both endpoints do not belong to any other maximal interior segment.Lemma 4.1Algorithm 4.1terminates in a finite number of steps, and it generates an ordering ι ofmis(T)such thatρ,ρ′∈mis(T)with ρ having one endpoint in the interior ofρ′implies thatι(ρ′)<ι(ρ).We show by contradiction that the algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps. Suppose the setAis not empty andAdoes not contain any element that satisfies the condition in Step 1. This would imply that eachρ∈Ahas at least one endpoint belonging to anotherρ′∈A. Since the number of elements inAis finite, this means that there must be a cycle of MIS, which contradicts with the assumption on the T-meshT. Finally, it is easy to see from Step 1 that the algorithm generates an ordering satisfying the stated condition.  □Note that the above algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps if and only if there are no cycles of MIS in the T-mesh. Indeed, from Lemma 4.1 we know that the algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps when there are no cycles of MIS in the T-mesh. On the other hand, if there is a cycle of MIS, sayρ:={ρ1,…,ρn}, then the setAcan never become empty (and so the algorithm does not terminate) because, by Definition 4.3, none of the elements ofρsatisfies the condition in Step 1. As a consequence, the algorithm can also be used to check whether or not there are cycles of MIS in a T-mesh.In the next corollary we address certain Tchebycheffian spline spaces defined over T-meshes without cycles of MIS. It is a generalization of Mourrain (2014, Proposition 4.3) in two directions, namely to the Tchebycheffian spline setting and to a family of T-meshes which includes hierarchical T-meshes (see Remark 4.1).Corollary 4.2LetTbe a T-mesh without cycles of MIS, and let r be a smoothness distribution onT. Then, assuming thatph≥2r(τ)+1for allτ∈T1o,vandpv≥2r(τ)+1for allτ∈T1o,h, we havedim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))=0.Let ι be an ordering ofmis(T)generated by Algorithm 4.1. Therefore, both endpoints of anyρ∈mis(T)belong toΓι(ρ), which must contain at least 2 elements. As a consequence, for anyρ∈mish(T)we have2ωι(ρ)=∑γ∈Γι(ρ)2(ph−rh(γ))=∑γ∈Γι(ρ)ph+ph−2rh(γ)≥∑γ∈Γι(ρ)ph+1≥2ph+2,which means thatωι(ρ)≥ph+1. Similarly, we deduce thatωι(ρ)≥pv+1for anyρ∈misv(T). From Proposition 3.2 we see thatThas ther-sum property onT, and so Theorem 3.1 completes the proof.  □Example 4.3Consider the T-meshTin Fig. 3, and the constant smoothness distributionronTas in (4.4) withμ=(1,1). The spaceSpT,r(T)withp=(3,3)has dimension 32. This immediately follows from the mesh numbers in Example 2.1, the dimension formula in Example 4.1 and Corollary 4.2.An analogous result for T-meshes without cycles was implicitly proved in Schumaker and Wang (2012) for the algebraic polynomial setting. The result can be extended to our non-polynomial setting by following the same line of arguments as in Bracco and Roman (2016) for spaces of generalized splines over T-meshes, which are Tchebycheffian splines belonging piecewisely to tensor-products of the spaces considered in Example 2.5. Although the original formulation was given for a constant smoothness distribution onT, its proof can be easily extended to a general smoothness distribution onT.Corollary 4.3LetTbe a T-mesh without cycles, and let r be a smoothness distribution onT. Then, assuming thatph≥2r(τ)+1for allτ∈T1o,vandpv≥2r(τ)+1for allτ∈T1o,h, we havedim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))=0.Finally, we observe that the properties of the subdivision algorithm presented in Mourrain (2014, Algorithm 4.4) hold in our Tchebycheffian spline context too. Let us start by recalling the algorithm.Algorithm 4.2Given a T-meshTand two positive integerskh,kv, the(kh,kv)-weighted subdivision rule is defined as follows. For any cellσ∈T2marked to be subdivided:1.split σ by adding the new edge τ;if inserting τ does not extend an existing edge, then extend τ so that the maximal segment containing τ, sayρ(τ), either intersects ∂Ω or satisfiesωι(ρ(τ))≥khwithρ(τ)∈mish(T)orωι(ρ(τ))≥kvwithρ(τ)∈misv(T).It is clear that applying the(kh,kv)-weighted subdivision rule to T-meshes satisfying(4.6)ωι(ρ)≥kh,∀ρ∈mish(T),ωι(ρ)≥kv,∀ρ∈misv(T),always gives T-meshes satisfying (4.6). In particular, if we choosekh≥ph+1andkv≥pv+1, then Theorem 3.1 implies thatdim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))=0, under the assumption thatThas ther-sum property onT. Therefore, the dimension of the corresponding space depends only on the number of cells, interior edges and interior vertices. Note that the study of this algorithm allows us to obtain the dimension formula for spaces of LR Tchebycheffian splines, i.e., the extension of LR-splines (see Dokken et al., 2013 and also Bracco et al., 2016) to the setting of Tchebycheffian splines.Example 4.2 and Corollaries 4.2–4.3 show that for a large class of Tchebycheffian spline spaces we have(4.7)dim⁡(SpT,r(T))=dim⁡(Spr(T)).Even though there are cases where this equality does not hold (see Section 5), we make the following conjecture inspired by the concept of generic embeddings used in Billera (1988) in the context of dimensions of polynomial spline spaces on triangulations.Conjecture 4.1The equality in(4.7)holds generically for all Tchebycheffian spline spaces on T-meshes. This means that if for a given spacePpTand a T-meshTwith a smoothness distribution r the equality in(4.7)does not hold, then there exists an arbitrarily small perturbation of the vertices ofTmaking the equality true.In this section we show that the dimension of the Tchebycheffian spline spaceSpT,r(T)can depend not only on the topological information ofTbut also on the geometry of the T-mesh. This particular behavior is usually referred to as instability in the dimension of the considered space. Examples of instability in the dimension are well known for polynomial spline spaces either defined over triangulations (Diener, 1990) or over T-meshes (Berdinsky et al., 2012; Li and Chen, 2011).We focus on the T-mesh in Fig. 1, which was already considered in Li and Chen (2011) in the case of polynomial splines. For this T-mesh we havef2=24,f1h=f1v=22,f0=21.Moreover, we takep=(2,2)and a constant smoothness distributionras in (4.4) withμ=(1,1). From (4.5) we obtain(5.1)dim⁡(SpT,r(T))=36+dim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To))).So, we still have to determinedim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To))). For this, we can use the characterization ofH0(IpT,r(To))provided in Proposition 3.8.Let{ψx¯,ih}i=02and{ψy¯,iv}i=02be Taylor-like bases of the spacesT2handT2v, respectively. From (2.2) and (2.3) we know that every element inIpT,r(ρv)can be written asqρv(x,y)=ψx¯,2h(x)∑j=02a2,jρvψy¯,jv(y),for somey¯, ifρvis a vertical maximal interior segment andx=x¯is the abscissa of any point ofρv. Similarly, every element inIpT,r(ρh)can be written asqρh(x,y)=ψy¯,2v(y)∑i=02ai,2ρhψx¯,ih(x),for somex¯, ifρhis a horizontal maximal interior segment andy=y¯is the abscissa of any point ofρh. Therefore, requiringqρv(x,y)=−qρh(x,y)implies that∑j=02a2,jρvψy¯,jv(y)is a multiple ofψy¯,2v(y)and∑i=02ai,2ρhψx¯,ih(x)is a multiple ofψx¯,2h(x). In other words, there exists a coefficientaρh,ρv∈Rsuch thatqρv(x,y)=−qρh(x,y)=aρh,ρvψx¯,2h(x)ψy¯,2v(y).The T-mesh in Fig. 1 has two horizontal maximal interior segments belonging to the straight linesy=t3andy=t4, respectively, and two maximal vertical interior segments belonging to the straight linesx=s3,x=s4, respectively. The maximal interior segments are ordered as followsy=t3,x=s3,y=t4,x=s4.We denote byγi,jthe vertex obtained by intersecting the linesx=siandy=tj. The vertices belonging to the maximal interior segments are ordered as followsγ4,3,γ1,3,γ2,3,γ3,3,γ3,1,γ3,2,γ3,4,γ2,4,γ5,4,γ4,4,γ4,2,γ4,5.From Proposition 3.8 it follows that(5.2)dim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))=dim⁡(⨁ρ∈mis(T)IpT,r(ρ))−dim⁡(∑γ∈T0oKγT)=4⋅3−dim⁡(∑γ∈T0oKγT).The elements of∑γ∈T0oKγTare linear combinations of the rows of the following matrix(ψs4,2h(x)ψt3,2v(y)00−ψs4,2h(x)ψt3,2v(y)ψs1,2h(x)ψt3,2v(y)000ψs2,2h(x)ψt3,2v(y)000ψs3,2h(x)ψt3,2v(y)−ψs3,2h(x)ψt3,2v(y)000−ψs3,2h(x)ψt1,2v(y)000−ψs3,2h(x)ψt2,2v(y)000−ψs3,2h(x)ψt4,2v(y)ψs3,2h(x)ψt4,2v(y)000ψs2,2h(x)ψt4,2v(y)000ψs5,2h(x)ψt4,2v(y)000ψs4,2h(x)ψt4,2v(y)−ψs4,2h(x)ψt4,2v(y)000−ψs4,2h(x)ψt2,2v(y)000−ψs4,2h(x)ψt5,2v(y)).Hence, the dimension of∑γ∈T0oKγTis given by the dimension of the space spanned by the rows of the following matrix(5.3)M:=(ψs4,2h(x)00ψt3,2v(y)ψs1,2h(x)000ψs2,2h(x)000ψs3,2h(x)ψt3,2v(y)000ψt1,2v(y)000ψt2,2v(y)000ψt4,2v(y)ψs3,2h(x)000ψs2,2h(x)000ψs5,2h(x)000ψs4,2h(x)ψt4,2v(y)000ψt2,2v(y)000ψt5,2v(y)).In the polynomial case, i.e.T2h=T2v=P2, we haveψx¯,ih(x)=(x−x¯)ii!,ψy¯,jv(x)=(y−y¯)jj!,i,j=0,1,2,and the dimension of∑γ∈T0oKγTwithT=(P2,P2)is given by the dimension of the space spanned by the rows of the following matrixMpoly(s1,…,s5;t1,…,t5):=(1s4s420000001t3t321s1s120000000001s2s220000000001s3s321t3t320000000001t1t120000000001t2t220000000001t4t421s3s320000000001s2s220000000001s5s520000000001s4s421t4t420000000001t2t220000000001t5t52).It is clear thatrank(Mpoly(s1,…,s5;t1,…,t5))≥11. The matrixMpoly(s1,…,s5;t1,…,t5)has been analyzed in Li and Chen (2011) where it has been proved thatdet⁡(Mpoly(s1,…,s5;t1,…,t5))=0if and only if(5.4)(s3−s1)(s5−s4)(t3−t1)(t5−t4)=(s4−s1)(s5−s3)(t4−t1)(t5−t3);see Fig. 1 and Fig. 5(a) for two examples. Therefore, from the formula (5.2) withT=(P2,P2)we getdim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))={1,if (5.4) holds,0,otherwise.In other words, the dimension of the quadraticC1polynomial spline space over the T-mesh in Fig. 1 depends on the geometry ofTaccording to the validity of (5.4). This result has also been obtained in Li and Chen (2011) by means of a different approach, the so-called smoothing cofactor method.Let us now consider the following space of exponential functions,G2,αexp:=〈1,eαx,e−αx〉,0<α∈R.It is easy to check that this space is the kernel of the differential operatorDx(Dx2−α2I), so it is an extended Tchebycheff space onR(see Example 2.4 or Example 2.5). A Taylor-like basis forG2,αexpis given byψ0,x¯(x)=1,ψ1,x¯(x)=12αeα(x−x¯)−12αe−α(x−x¯),ψ2,x¯(x)=−1α2+12α2eα(x−x¯)+12α2e−α(x−x¯).Therefore, we may conclude from (5.3) that the dimension of∑γ∈T0oKγTwithT=(G2,αexp,G2,αexp)is given by the dimension of the space spanned by the rows of the following matrixMexp(s1,…,s5;t1,…,t5):=(1eαs4e−αs40000001eαt3e−αt31eαs1e−αs10000000001eαs2e−αs20000000001eαs3e−αs31eαt3e−αt30000000001eαt1e−αt10000000001eαt2e−αt20000000001eαt4e−αt41eαs3e−αs30000000001eαs2e−αs20000000001eαs5e−αs50000000001eαs4e−αs41eαt4e−αt40000000001eαt2e−αt20000000001eαt5e−αt5).Again it is easy to see thatrank(Mexp(s1,…,s5;t1,…,t5))≥11. Moreover, when considering the substitutionxi:=eαsi,yi:=eαti,i=1,…,5,it can be verified that(x2y2∏i=15xiyi)det⁡(Mexp(s1,…,s5;t1,…,t5))=det⁡(Mpoly(x1,…,x5;y1,…,y5)).Taking into account (5.4), this means that in the exponential case the condition for rank deficiency is(5.5)(eαs3−eαs1)(eαs5−eαs4)(eαt3−eαt1)(eαt5−eαt4)=(eαs4−eαs1)(eαs5−eαs3)(eαt4−eαt1)(eαt5−eαt3);see Fig. 1 and Fig. 5(b) for two examples. Therefore, from the formula (5.2) withT=(G2,αexp,G2,αexp)we getdim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))={1,if (5.5) holds,0,otherwise.Note that the spaceG2,αexpis equal to〈1,sinh⁡(αx),cosh⁡(αx)〉and the condition in (5.5) is equivalent to(5.6)sinh⁡(α(s3−s1)2)sinh⁡(α(s5−s4)2)sinh⁡(α(t3−t1)2)sinh⁡(α(t5−t4)2)=sinh⁡(α(s4−s1)2)sinh⁡(α(s5−s3)2)sinh⁡(α(t4−t1)2)sinh⁡(α(t5−t3)2).Indeed, the above relation can be obtained by multiplying both sides of (5.5) bye−α(s1+s3+s4+s5)/2e−α(t1+t3+t4+t5)/2,and by using the identitysinh⁡y=(ey−e−y)/2.Finally, let us consider the following space of trigonometric functions,G2,αtrig:=〈1,sin⁡(αx),cos⁡(αx)〉,0<α(b−a)<π,which is an extended Tchebycheff space on the interval[a,b]. By following the same arguments as before, we can show that there is an instability in the dimension of the space∑γ∈T0oKγTwithT=(G2,αtrig,G2,αtrig)characterized by the condition(5.7)sin⁡(α(s3−s1)2)sin⁡(α(s5−s4)2)sin⁡(α(t3−t1)2)sin⁡(α(t5−t4)2)=sin⁡(α(s4−s1)2)sin⁡(α(s5−s3)2)sin⁡(α(t4−t1)2)sin⁡(α(t5−t3)2).As a consequence,dim⁡(H0(IpT,r(To)))={1,if (5.7) holds,0,otherwise.We remark that both rank deficiency conditions in (5.6)–(5.7) approach (5.4) as the parameter α tends to 0. On the one hand, we see that there exist special geometric configurations ofTsuch that the 0-homology term in (5.1) exceeds 0 for the polynomial, exponential and trigonometric case (see, e.g., Fig. 1). On the other hand, there also exist geometric configurations ofTsuch that the 0-homology term in (5.1) exceeds 0 for the polynomial case but not for the exponential/trigonometric case and vice versa (see, e.g., Fig. 5).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper we have defined Tchebycheffian spline spaces over planar T-meshes and we have addressed the problem of determining their dimension. We have provided combinatorial lower and upper bounds for the dimension, and we have shown that these bounds coincide if the dimensions of the underlying extended Tchebycheff section spaces are large enough with respect to the smoothness, under some mild conditions on the T-mesh. Moreover, we have illustrated that the dimension of Tchebycheffian spline spaces over T-meshes can depend on the exact geometry of the given T-mesh.Some of the results have been proved under a technical assumption on the underlying extended Tchebycheff spaces, see Definition 3.1 and Definition 3.3. However, as conjectured in Section 3.1, we think that any extended (complete) Tchebycheff space possesses this property, just like the algebraic polynomial space does. This means that the assumption should not restrict our results in practice.As expected, it turns out that Tchebycheffian spline spaces and polynomial spline spaces over planar T-meshes behave completely similarly from the dimension point of view. Even stronger, we conjecture in Section 4.2 that the dimensions of these two spline spaces agree generically.The main ingredient of the paper is the extension of the homological characterization proposed in Mourrain (2014) to the Tchebycheffian spline context. This extension is non-trivial because the ring structure of algebraic polynomials cannot be used anymore in this general setting. Nevertheless, basically all the results obtained for polynomial splines have been rephrased, and sometimes improved, for Tchebycheffian splines. This strengthens the structural similarity between polynomial and Tchebycheffian spline spaces, which originates in the same upper bounds on the number of (real) roots of any non-trivial element of the space.
