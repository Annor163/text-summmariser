@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Due to the special characteristics and challenges in Chinese language, event extraction in Chinese is much more difficult than that in English. In particular, the state-of-the-art Chinese event extraction systems suffer much from the low recall in trigger identification due to the failure in identifying unknown triggers and the inconsistency in identifying trigger mentions. To resolve these two issues, this paper proposes an inference mechanism to infer unknown triggers via the compositional semantics inside Chinese words and another inference mechanism to recover trigger mentions via the discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions. Here, various morphological structures are explored to better represent the compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers and automatically identify the head morpheme as the governing sememe of a trigger in inferring unknown triggers. Evaluation on the ACE 2005 Chinese corpus justifies the effectiveness of our approach over a strong baseline in Chinese event extraction, in particular trigger identification.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As a compromise to natural language understanding, Information Extraction (IE) aims to extract structured information (e.g., entities, relations and events) from a text. As a classic IE task, event extraction is to identify instances of a predefined event type and can be typically divided into four components: trigger identification, event type classification, argument identification and argument role classification. In the literature, most studies focus on English event extraction (e.g., Ahn, 2006; Finkel, Grenager, & Manning, 2005; Grishman, Westbrook, & Meyers, 2005; Hardy, Kanchakouskaya, & Strzalkowski, 2006; Hong et al., 2011; Ji & Grishman, 2008; Liao & Grishman, 2010; Llorens, Saquete, & Navarro-Colorado, 2013; Lu & Roth, 2012; Maslennikov & Chua, 2007; Patwardhan & Riloff, 2007; Patwardhan & Riloff, 2009).In comparison, there are few successful stories regarding Chinese event extraction due to the special characteristics in Chinese trigger identification. In particular, there are two major sources for the low performance (particularly the recall): the occurrence of unknown triggers1If a trigger in the test set doesn’t occur in the training set, we regard it as an unknown trigger. Otherwise, a known trigger.1and the lack of sentence-level information.For the occurrence of unknown triggers, Table 1gives the statistics in both the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) 2005 Chinese and English corpora2The whole Chinese ACE corpus has 3332 event mentions. For the sake of fair comparison, we randomly choose the same number of event mentions from the English corpus as the cross-validation data.2using 10-fold cross-validation. In each validation, we leave 10% trigger mentions as the test set and the remaining ones as the training set. It shows that unknown triggers cover about 21% of Chinese trigger mentions while this figure reduces to only about 9% in English. It also shows that given the same number of event mentions, there are about 30% more different trigger types in Chinese than that in English. This justifies the low performance (particularly the recall) of a Chinese event extraction system, which normally extracts those known trigger mentions occurring in the training data as candidate instances and uses a classifier to distinguish true trigger mentions from pseudo ones.For the lack of sentence-level information, some event mentions fail to provide enough intra-sentential information to the classifier and can be only inferred confidently from the discourse-level information, in particular for Chinese event extraction, especially when the word triggering an event is polysemous or an unknown trigger. Kim (2000) compares the use of overt subjects in English and Chinese, and finds out that overt subjects occupy over 96% in English, while this figure drops to only 64% in Chinese. Our statistics in the ACE 2005 Chinese corpora shows that almost 55% event arguments are missing and this imposes extra difficulty in Chinese event extraction.To resolve above two issues, this paper proposes two novel inference mechanisms to Chinese trigger identification by employing the compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers to infer unknown triggers and imposing the discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions to recover trigger mentions.The first mechanism is motivated by the compositional nature of Chinese words, whose semantics can be often determined by the component morphemes. Hence, it is natural to infer unknown triggers by employing the compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers. Take following two sentences as examples:(E1)4名学生被玻璃划伤/4-Ming-Xue-Sheng-Bei-Bo-Li-Hua-Shang/。(Four students werescratchedby the glass.) ---Known trigger(E2)1名乘客被刺伤/1-Ming-Cheng-Ke-Bei-Chi-Shang/。(A passenger wasstabbed.) ---Unknown triggerwhere “划伤/Hua-Shang/” is a known trigger and “刺伤/Chi-Shang/” is an unknown one.In the above examples, the semantics of “划伤/Hua-Shang/” (injure by scratching) in (E1) can be largely determined from those of “划/Hua/” (scratch) and “伤/Shang/” (injure) while the semantics of “刺伤/Chi-Shang/” (injure by stabbing) in (E2) from those of “刺/Chi/” (stab) and “伤/Shang/” (injure). Since these two triggers have similar morphological structures, we can easily infer that “刺伤/Chi-Shang/”(injure by stabbing) in (E2) is a trigger if “划伤/Hua-Shang/”(injure by scratching) in (E1) is known as a trigger. Similarly, we can infer more triggers in the event type injure, such as “灼伤/Zhuo-Shang/” (injure by burning), “撞伤/Zhuang-Shang/” (injure by hitting), “压伤/Ya-Shang/” (injure by pressing), etc.The second mechanism is enlightened by the wide existance of the discourse consistency in natural languages, particularly for Chinese, due to its discourse-driven nature (Zhu, 1980). Very often, distinguishing true trigger mentions from pseudo ones is only possible with discourse-level information. Take following two contingent sentences as examples:(E3)美国与北韩3号在吉隆坡结束飞弹会谈/Mei-Guo-Yu-Bei-Han-3-Hao-Zai-Ji-Long-Po-Jie-Shu-Fei-Dan-Hui-Tan/。(The United States and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea finished missiletalks in Kuala Lumpur.)(E4)会谈的气氛严肃/Hui-Tan-De-Qi-Fen-Yan-Su/。(Thetalksare serious.)While it is easy to determine that mention “会谈/Hui-Tan/”(talk) in the sentence (E3) indicates a meet event from the intra-sentential information (entities, such as agents, time and place in the sentence) and difficult for mention “会谈/Hui-Tan/”(talk) in the sentence (E4), we can easily infer from the sentence (E3) that “会谈/Hui-Tan/”(talk) in the sentence (E4) also indicates a meet event, using the one sense per discourse principle: if one instance of a word in a discourse is a trigger mention of an event type, it is very likely that its other instances in the same discourse will be a trigger mention of the same event type.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 overviews the related work. Section 3 introduces a state-of-the-art baseline system for Chinese event extraction. Sections 4 describes the inference mechanism to infer unknown triggers for Chinese trigger identification by employing the compositional semantics inside Chinese triggers. Section 5 describes the inference mechanism to recover trigger mentions by imposing the discourse consistency between Chinese trigger mentions. Section 6 presents the experimental results. Section 7 discusses the impact of our two mechanisms. Section 8 concludes the paper and points out future work.
