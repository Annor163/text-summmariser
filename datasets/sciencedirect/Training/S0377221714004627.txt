@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Quality of decisions in inventory management models depends on the accuracy of parameter estimates used for decision making. In many situations, error in decision making is unavoidable. In such cases, sensitivity analysis is necessary for better implementation of the model. Though the newsvendor model is one of the most researched inventory models, little is known about its robustness. In this paper, we perform sensitivity analysis of the classical newsvendor model. Conditions for symmetry/skewness of cost deviation (i.e., deviation of expected demand–supply mismatch cost from its minimum) have been identified. These conditions are closely linked with symmetry/skewness of the demand density function. A lower bound of cost deviation is established for symmetric unimodal demand distributions. Based on demonstrations of the lower bound, we found the newsvendor model to be sensitive to sub-optimal ordering decisions, more sensitive than the economic order quantity model. Order quantity deviation (i.e., deviation of order quantity from its optimum) is explored briefly. We found the magnitude of order quantity deviation to be comparable with that of parameter estimation error. Mean demand is identified as the most influential parameter in deciding order quantity deviation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The newsvendor problem is one of the most well-researched and widely applicable inventory management problems (Choi, 2012). It is about deciding the order quantity of a product with uncertain demand such that the penalty associated with demand–supply mismatch at the end of the selling season is minimized. This inventory problem was first addressed by Arrow, Harris, and Marschak (1951) in their seminal paper “Optimal Inventory Policy”. Due to its wide applicability, different versions of the newsvendor model have been developed in the past six decades. Review of those works can be found in Silver, Pyke, and Peterson (1998), Khouja (1999), Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, and Seref (2011), and Choi (2012). The simplest version of the newsvendor model, which is referred to as the classical newsvendor model (seeSilver et al., 1998, chap. 10 for assumptions and analysis), is focus of the current study.Newsvendor model, like any other inventory optimization model, requires knowledge of certain parameters for decision making. One common implementation issue with these models is the possibility of error in estimation of the model parameters. The optimal order quantity,Q∗in the newsvendor model is given byF(Q∗)=cu/(co+cu)where F denotes the demand distribution function andcoandcudenote unit over-stocking and under-stocking costs. Each of these parameters may not be known correctly in every situation. For example, newsvendor deals with stochastic demand, whose realization takes place only after the procurement decision is made. Hence, theoretically speaking, correct knowledge of the demand distribution function (i.e., the form and associated parameters) with certainty is impossible at the time of decision making.Unit over-stocking cost is the unit purchase cost less salvage value of an unsold item. Though purchase cost is generally known at the time of procurement decision, there are exceptions. If the newsvendor itself is the manufacturer and the production environment is complex (involving multiple items), purchase cost, i.e., production cost specific to the focal item may not be known correctly. The other component of over-stocking cost, i.e., salvage value, too, may not be correctly known. Newsvendor sells excess inventory in secondary market and then the remaining stock is disposed off. This process begins after the selling season is over and it involves multiple agents, thereby making the assessment of salvage value at the time of procurement decision difficult.Unit under-stocking cost is the sum of unit profit and goodwill loss due to unmet demand of one unit. Unit profit is the unit selling price less unit purchase cost. We have already noted that purchase cost may not be known correctly in some situations. If the selling price is market-driven (e.g., selling prices of commodity products), due to time-precedence of the procurement decision over selling season, actual selling price may not be correctly known at the time of decision making. The other component of under-stocking cost, i.e., stock-out goodwill loss is the most elusive cost component in the newsvendor model. Stock-out is reflected back as loss of future demand (of the concerned product as well as other products) through complex human behavior (Hadley & Whitin, 1963, pg. 20), which makes the quantification of goodwill loss very difficult.It is evident from the above discussion that parameter estimation error is unavoidable in the newsvendor model. Then the operational decision, which is derived using the parameter estimates, is likely to deviate from the optimum. Parameter estimation error is not the only reason for sub-optimal decisions in the newsvendor model. Based on experiments, Schweitzer and Cachon (2000) reported that managers tend to order more than the optimum whenQ∗<μand order less than the optimum whenQ∗>μwhereμdenotes the mean demand. This “pull-to-center” effect was confirmed by other scholars (e.g., Bostian, Holt, & Smith, 2008). A number of alternate explanations were proposed, for example, Su (2008) showed that bounded rationality on the part of the newsvendor leads to the “pull-to-center” effect.A sub-optimal decision, irrespective of the reason behind it, leads to greater cost. We study the nature of deviation of expected demand–supply mismatch cost from its minimum, in short, cost deviation. In particular, we attempt to address two issues. First, we identify the conditions for symmetry and skewness of cost deviation. If the newsvendor is uncertain about the optimal order quantity, these conditions would tell which is better, ordering more or ordering less. Second, we study the magnitude of cost deviation by establishing a lower bound. This reveals whether the newsvendor model is sensitive to sub-optimal decisions or not. Depending upon severity of the situation, further actions can be taken to improve the decision making.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We review relevant literature and derive an expression for cost deviation before proceeding to the next section. In Section 2, we identify the conditions for symmetry/skewness of cost deviation. In Section 3, we establish a lower bound of cost deviation for symmetric unimodal demand distributions. Then we demonstrate the lower bound along with cost deviation for normal demand distribution. In Section 4, we briefly study order quantity deviation, i.e., deviation of order quantity from its optimum. We conclude in Section 5 by discussing main results of this work and identifying future research possibilities.Sensitivity analysis of some important inventory models are available in the literature. Economic order quantity (EOQ) model is one of the most popular inventory models. One reason for its popularity is its robustness to sub-optimal decisions. A discussion on sensitivity analysis of the EOQ model can be found in operations management textbooks (e.g., Nahmias, 2001). In the EOQ model, cost deviation is left-skewed and relatively insensitive to order quantity deviation. Zheng (1992) performed sensitivity analysis of the stochastic (r,Q) inventory system and found it to be more robust than its deterministic counterpart, the EOQ model. Chen and Zheng (1997) found similar result for the stochastic (s,S) inventory system with exponential demand.A surprise omission from the above inventory models is the newsvendor model. However, there are some studies that indirectly address sensitivity analysis of the newsvendor model. We can classify them into two groups: (a) sensitivity of cost deviation to sub-optimal order quantities and (b) sensitivity of order quantity deviation to parameter estimation error. These two can be combined to yield sensitivity of cost deviation to parameter estimation error. We can further classify studies in each of the above groups into four subgroups: (i) direction of deviation, (ii) symmetry/skewness of deviation, (iii) magnitude of deviation, and (iv) distribution of deviation. Since the newsvendor model is multi-parameter model, the question of parameter importance (in influencing order quantity deviation or cost deviation) is relevant too.Direction of cost and order quantity deviations can be understood easily by examining the standard results of the newsvendor model. Lapin (1988, chap. 6) noted down some of these. Since expected mismatch cost is convex in order quantity, it increases whenever order quantity deviates from its optimum. Note that cost deviation is positive if expected mismatch cost increases and negative if it decreases. The same is true for order quantity deviation. SinceF(Q∗)=cu/(co+cu), order quantity increases with under-estimation of over-stocking cost (co) and decreases with its over-estimation. This relation is exactly opposite for under-stocking cost (cu). Order quantity is increasing in mean demand. Using mean preserving transformation, Gerchak and Mossman (1992) showed that order quantity is increasing in demand variability ifF(μ)<ξwhereξ=cu/(co+cu)is known as the critical fractile. The relation is opposite ifF(μ)>ξ.Sensitivity analysis results regarding directions of deviations of some generalized newsvendor models are available in literature. The classical newsvendor model is a special case of the generalized models. Lau and Lau (2002) considered a supply chain with newsvendor type retailer and identified impact of demand variability on decision variables. Their conclusions are similar to that of Gerchak and Mossman (1992) when order quantity is the only decision variable, i.e., the retailer faces the classical newsvendor problem. Eeckhoudt, Gollier, and Schlesinger (1995) studied risk-averse newsvendor problem (risk-neutrality is equivalent to the classical problem) and identified influence of cost parameters on order quantity. Wang (2011) performed a similar study for newsvendor problem with advertisement-sensitive demand (no advertisement is equivalent to the classical problem). Their findings are similar to that of Lapin (1988).In the newsvendor literature, there are studies that develop extensions of the classical newsvendor model and perform sensitivity analysis w.r.t. parameter(s) that differentiate it from the classical model, for example, Chen and Chen (2010) studied a multi-product budget-constrained newsvendor problem with a reservation policy and performed sensitivity analysis of expected profit and order quantity to the budget amount. There are more such studies. These studies, being contextually different, do not add much to our understanding of robustness of the classical newsvendor model.Based on the above literature review, it is clear that our understanding of sensitivity of the classical newsvendor model is limited to the directions of deviations only. In this work, we study symmetry and magnitude of cost deviation as order quantity deviates from its optimum. We briefly explore order quantity deviation too.We use the following notations in this paper.aLower limit of demand.a⩾0.bUpper limit of demand.a<b<∞.rRatio of demand limits.r=a/b,r∈[0,1).F()Distribution function of stochastic demand.F(a)=0,F(b)=1. We assume strict monotony of F in[a,b]so that the optimal solution is unique.f()Density function associated with F. We assume Riemann integrability of f, i.e., f is bounded and continuous almost everywhere (Royden, 2004, pg. 85).μMean demand.σStandard deviation of demand.cvCoefficient of variation.coUnit over-stocking cost.co>0.cuUnit under-stocking cost.cu>0.ξCritical fractile.ξ=cu/(co+cu),ξ∈(0,1).QOrder quantity.Q⩾0.Q∗denotes its optimum.C(Q)Demand–supply mismatch cost for a supply of Q.δQOrder quantity deviation.δC(δQ)Cost deviation for an order quantity deviation ofδQ.θ^Estimate ofθ.θcan beμ,σ,co,cu, andξ.δθDeviation ofθfrom its true value.Let X denote the random demand. Then(1)C(Q)=comax{0,Q-X}+cumax{0,X-Q}.A careful look into the above expression reveals thatC(Q)>C(a)for anyQ<aandC(Q)>C(b)for anyQ>bin every demand scenario. Thus, the expected cost minimizing order quantity is in[a,b]. Expected cost is given by(2)E[C(Q)]=co∫aQ(Q-x)f(x)dx+cu∫Qb(x-Q)f(x)dx=(co+cu)ξ(μ-Q)+∫aQ(Q-x)f(x)dx.It is well establish thatE[C(Q)]is convex in Q andF(Q∗)=ξgives the optimal solution (Silver et al., 1998, chap. 10). Since F is strictly increasing in[a,b],Q∗is unique. The minimum expected cost is given by(3)E[C(Q∗)]=(co+cu)ξμ-∫aQ∗xf(x)dx.We use ratio-based measure for deviation. Ratio-based measures are unit-less. Hence, comparison among deviations is easy.δQ=(Q-Q∗)/Q∗andδC={E[C(Q)]-E[C(Q∗)]}/E[C(Q∗)].δQ⩾-1asQ⩾0andδC⩾0asE[C(Q)]⩾E[C(Q∗)]. Using (2) and (3),(4)E[C(Q)]-E[C(Q∗)]co+cu=-ξQ+∫aQQf(x)dx-∫Q∗Qxf(x)dx=-ξQ+QF(Q)-QF(Q)-Q∗ξ-∫Q∗QF(x)dx=∫Q∗Q{F(x)-ξ}dx.Similarly, (3) can be rewritten as(5)E[C(Q∗)]co+cu=ξ(μ-Q∗)+∫aQ∗F(x)dx.WritingQ=Q∗(1+δQ)and combining (4) and (5),(6)δC(δQ)=∫Q∗Q∗(1+δQ){F(x)-ξ}dxξ(μ-Q∗)+∫aQ∗F(x)dx.Unlike the EOQ model, where cost deviation is independent of model parameters,δC(δQ)in the newsvendor model depends onξand F. These dependencies, particularly the presence of demand distribution function, make the sensitivity analysis complicated. We begin our analysis with the study of symmetry/skewness ofδC(δQ)in the next section.Let us formally define symmetry, skewness, and asymmetry of a real-valued function.Definition 1Let g be a real-valued function defined on an interval I. Letx0∈Iande0>0such thatx0-e0,x0+e0∈I. Then we say that g isi.symmetric inx0±e0ifg(x0-e)=g(x0+e)∀e∈(0,e0].left-skewed inx0±e0ifg(x0-e)>g(x0+e)∀e∈(0,e0].right-skewed inx0±e0ifg(x0-e)<g(x0+e)∀e∈(0,e0].asymmetric inx0±e0if none among the above three holds.Definition 1 can be easily modified for functions defined on integer domain. SinceδQ⩾-1, we restricte0∈(0,1]so that Definition 1 is valid forδC(δQ). The following results connect symmetry/skewness ofδC(δQ)with that of the demand density function.Proposition 1δC(δQ)is symmetric in0±e0if and only if the demand density function is symmetric almost everywhere inQ∗±e0Q∗.Density function of uniformly distributed demand is always symmetric inQ∗±e0Q∗providede0is not large, i.e.,[Q∗(1-e0),Q∗(1+e0)]⊆[a,b]. Then by Proposition 1,δC(δQ)is symmetric in0±e0. The condition for skewness is somewhat different.Proposition 2δC(δQ)is left (right) skewed in0±e0if the demand density function is left (right) skewed almost everywhere inQ∗±e0Q∗.Propositions 1 and 2 identify the conditions for symmetry and skewness of cost deviation. Given a range (0±e0) forδQ, theδC(δQ)curve can be of four types: (i) symmetric, (ii) left-skewed, (iii) right-skewed, and (iv) asymmetric. Depending on the nature of demand density inQ∗±e0Q∗, we can classify f into four mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive groups: (i) symmetric almost everywhere, (ii) left-skewed almost everywhere, (iii) right-skewed almost everywhere, and (iv) asymmetric with the set of asymmetry having a positive measure. The set of asymmetry for an asymmetric g inx0±e0is defined as the smallestS⊆[x0-e0,x0+e0]such that a redefined g in S removes asymmetry of g inx0±e0. Propositions 1 and 2 connect symmetry/skewness of f with that ofδC(δQ)as given in Table 1.The last relation in Table 1 follows from the other relations. Note that an asymmetric f inQ∗±e0Q∗with the set of asymmetry having a positive measure, which is necessary for asymmetry ofδC(δQ)in0±e0, may also lead to left/right skewness ofδC(δQ). For example, if the demand distribution is triangular with parameters (0,70,200) andξ=0.4(thenQ∗=75.1), f is asymmetric inQ∗±0.3Q∗with the set of asymmetry having a positive measure, butδC(δQ)is left-skewed in0±0.3. For symmetric unimodal (in strong sense) distributions, asymmetry of f never arises. ThenδC(δQ)is either symmetric of left/right skewed.Corollary 1For symmetric unimodal (in strong sense) demand,δC(δQ)is right-skewed ifξ<1/2and left-skewed ifξ>1/2. Ifξ=1/2,δC(δQ)is symmetric.We say that a distribution isi.symmetric if there existss∈Rsuch that f is symmetric ins±xfor everyx>0.unimodal if f is non-decreasing in(-∞,m]and non-increasing in[m,∞)for somem∈R.s and m are referred to as point of symmetry and mode. Strict unimodality of F requires f to be strictly increasing in[a,m]and strictly decreasing in[m,b]where[a,b]denotes the support of F. A distribution is symmetric unimodal if it is both symmetric and unimodal. Note that point of symmetry is always a mode for symmetric unimodal distributions. Since we are dealing with symmetric distributions in bounded interval support[a,b], point of symmetry is same as the midpoint((a+b)/2). Furthermore,μ=(a+b)/2due to symmetry. Thus, a symmetric unimodal demand distribution is symmetric w.r.t.μ, which is also a mode.See Appendix A for the proofs of Propositions 1 and 2 and Corollary 1. Commonly used demand distributions such as symmetric triangular distribution and normal distribution (with equidistant truncation from the mode) are symmetric and strictly unimodal. In these cases, ifξ<1/2,δC(-δQ)<δC(δQ)and ifξ>1/2,δC(-δQ)>δC(δQ)for everyδQ>0. Table 2illustrates this observation. Using (12),δC(δQ)is calculated for differentξfor normally distributed demand withcv=0.25(no truncation). It is evident thatδC(δQ)is right-skewed forξ=0.25, symmetric forξ=0.5, and left-skewed forξ=0.75.According to Corollary 1, for symmetric unimodal (in strong sense) demand, it is better to under-estimate the order quantity (than over-estimating) ifξ<1/2and it is better to over-estimate the order quantity (than under-estimating) ifξ>1/2.Let us turn our attention to the study of magnitude of cost deviation.δC(δQ)depends onξand F. Sinceξ∈(0,1), we can capture dependence ofδConξby considering different scenarios (i.e., different values ofξ). On the other hand, F can be “anything”. There is no simple way to capture dependence ofδCon F. A possible solution to this problem lies in establishing F-independent bounds ofδC(δQ). We established a lower bound ofδC(δQ)for symmetric unimodal demand distributions. Demonstration of the lower bound led us to conclude that the newsvendor model (with symmetric unimodal demand) is sensitive to sub-optimal order quantities.We can rewrite (6) asδC(δQ)=N(δQ)/Dwhere(7)N(δQ)=∫Q∗Q∗(1+δQ){F(x)-ξ}dx,(8)D=ξ(μ-Q∗)+∫aQ∗F(x)dx.Note thatN(δQ)is non-negative and D is positive. We establish lower bound ofδC(δQ)for symmetric unimodal demand by finding a lower bound ofN(δQ)and an upper bound of D.We follow Definition 2 for symmetry and unimodality of a distribution. Observe that a unimodal F is convex in(-∞,m]and concave in[m,∞)where m denotes mode.1Let u and v be two arbitrary points in(-∞,m]. Without loss of generality, letu⩽v. Letw=(u+v)/2. Since F is unimodal, f is non-decreasing in(-∞,m]. ThenF(v)-F(w)⩾F(w)-F(u)⇒F(w)⩽{F(u)+F(v)}/2. Hence, F is mid-point convex in(-∞,m]. F is continuous too. Then F is convex in(-∞,m](Simon, 2011, pg. 3). Concavity of F in[m,∞)can be proved in a similar manner.1Popular distributions for demand modelling such as uniform distribution, symmetric triangular distribution, and normal distribution (with equidistant truncation from the mode) are symmetric and unimodal. We denote the set of symmetric unimodal distributions in[a,b]bySUDa,b. EveryF∈SUDa,bis symmetric w.r.t.μ=(a+b)/2, which is also a mode. Uniform distribution has a special place inSUDa,b. In some sense, it is at the boundary ofSUDa,b.Lemma 1F(x)⩽FU(x)ifx<μandF(x)⩾FU(x)ifx⩾μfor everyF∈SUDa,bwhereFUdenotes the uniform distribution in[a,b].The first part of Lemma 1 follows from convexity of F in[a,μ]. Due to convexity,F(λa+(1-λ)μ)⩽λF(a)+(1-λ)F(μ)=(1-λ)/2∀λ∈(0,1]. Denotingλa+(1-λ)μ=x, i.e.,(1-λ)=(x-a)/(μ-a)=2FU(x), we getF(x)⩽FU(x)forx<μ. Similarly, the second part of Lemma 1 can be proved using concavity of F in[μ,b]. Lemma 1 has following consequence for the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor model.Corollary 2Q∗⩾QU∗ifξ<1/2andQ∗⩽QU∗ifξ⩾1/2for everyF∈SUDa,bwhereQU∗corresponds to the uniform distribution in[a,b].Proof of Corollary 2 is straight forward. Ifξ<1/2, due to strict monotony of F in[a,b],Q∗<μ. Then by Lemma 1,F(Q∗)⩽FU(Q∗). Assuming a contradiction to Corollary 2, letQ∗<QU∗for someξ<1/2. Thenξ=F(Q∗)⩽FU(Q∗)<FU(QU∗)=ξ, which is impossible. Hence,Q∗⩾QU∗ifξ<1/2. The other part of Corollary 2 can be proved in a similar manner.Lemma 1 and Corollary 2 are useful in establishing F-independent bounds ofN(δQ)and D.Proposition 3LetQ=Q∗(1+δQ)∈[a,b]. LetQU∗correspond to the uniform distribution in[a,b]. Let us defineδ=min{δQ,μ/QU∗-1}ifξ<1/2, otherwiseδ=max{δQ,μ/QU∗-1}. Then for everyF∈SUDa,b,i.N(δQ)⩾ξQU∗2b+ab-aδ2+QU∗(δQ2-δ2)ξ(b-a)ifξ<1/2.ii.N(δQ)⩾(1-ξ)μ2b+ab-aδ2+QU∗(δQ2-δ2)(1-ξ)(b-a)ifξ⩾1/2.In Proposition 3, we made an assumption thatQ∈[a,b]. Theoretically, Q can take any non-negative value. However, it is very unlikely that one would order a quantity that is outside the observed demand range,[ao,bo]. Since[ao,bo]⊆[a,b], we can assume thatQ∈[a,b]. However, this argument may not be valid if the number of observations is very few.Proposition 4For everyF∈SUDa,b,D⩽DUwhereDUcorresponds to the uniform distribution in[a,b].Bounds ofN(δQ)and D are expressed in terms ofQU∗,DU, and parameters(a,b,ξ). RearrangingFU(QU∗)=(QU∗-a)/(b-a)=ξ, we get (9). Then using (8) and (9), we get (10).(9)QU∗=a+ξ(b-a).(10)DU=12ξ(1-ξ)(b-a).See Appendix B for the proofs of Propositions 3 and 4. Using these results, we get a lower bound ofδC(δQ)for symmetric unimodal demand. Numerator and denominator of the resultant lower bound are divided by b to make the bound dependent onr=a/binstead of a and b.Proposition 5LetQ=Q∗(1+δQ)∈[a,b]. Then for everyF∈SUDa,b,(11a)i.δC(δQ)⩾r+ξ(1-r)(1-ξ)(1-r)1+r1-rδ2+r+ξ(1-r)ξ(1-r)(δQ2-δ2)(11b)ifξ<1/2whereδ=min{δQ,((1/2-ξ)(1-r))/(r+ξ(1-r))}.ii.δC(δQ)⩾1+r2ξ(1-r)1+r1-rδ2+r+ξ(1-r)(1-ξ)(1-r)(δQ2-δ2)ifξ⩾1/2whereδ=max{δQ,-((ξ-1/2)(1-r))/(r+ξ(1-r))}.Lower bound ofδC(δQ)depends on r andξthat take values between 0 and 1. This enables us to construct different scenarios by changingr,ξ∈(0,1)and study behavior of the lower bound. Along with the lower bound, we demonstrate cost deviation for normal demand.We specify a symmetric truncated normal distribution using its support and coefficient of variation (of the underlying normal distribution). We cannot use (6) directly to evaluateδC(δQ)because F does not have a closed form expression for normal distribution. Instead, we use the following expression. See Appendix C for the details.(12)δC(δQ)=z{Φ(z)-Φ(z∗)}+{ϕ(z)-ϕ(z∗)}ϕ(z∗)-ϕ(-k/cv)wherez∗=Φ-1(1-ξ)Φ(-k/cv)+ξΦ(k/cv),z=z∗(1+δQ)+δQ/cv, andk=(1-r)/(1+r).ϕandΦdenote density and distribution functions of the standard normal distribution.Like the lower bound of cost deviation,δC(δQ)for normal distribution depends on r andξ. Fig. 1shows cost deviation curves for the normal distribution and the lower bound in different scenarios. Each diagram corresponds to a combination of r andξvalues. We considered low (0.25), moderate (0.5), and high (0.75) values for both. Thin solid curves in each diagram correspond to the normal distribution with differentcvvalues (0.1,0.15,0.2,0.3). A largercvproduces a flatter curve. Let us refers to theδC(δQ)curve for normal distribution with coefficient of variationcvasN(cv)curve. The thick solid curve corresponds to the lower bound.We also indicateδC(δQ)for the EOQ model (the thick dotted curve) for easy comparison.δC(δQ)=δQ2/{2(1+δQ)}for the EOQ model (Nahmias, 2001, pg. 208). Dotted lines with slope 1 and-1separate the error “dampening” and “amplifying” zones. If a curve (or part of it) lies below these lines, the magnitude of the output error is less than that of the input error (dampening of error). Conversely, if a curve (or part of it) lies above these lines, the output error is more in magnitude than the input error (amplification of error).Key observationsi.N(cv)curves and the lower bound are steeper than the EOQ curve. Very small part of theN(cv)curves lie below the±1slope lines. The same is true for the lower bound forr⩾0.5.Steepness of theN(cv)curves and the lower bound increases in r. Steepness of theN(cv)curves decreases incv.Steepness of theN(cv)curves and the lower bound increases inξ. However, the impact ofξis much lesser than that of r and diminishes as r increases.Greater steepness of theN(cv)curves and the lower bound compared to the EOQ curve demonstrates that the newsvendor model is more sensitive to sub-optimal order quantities than the EOQ model. Like the EOQ curve, the±1slope lines act as benchmark. Locations of theN(cv)curves and the lower bound imply that amplification of error occurs in many situations, particularly when r is moderate to high.From the behavior of theN(cv)curves and the lower bound as r changes, it is evident that robustness of the newsvendor model deteriorates with increase in r. This behavior can be explained by flattening of the density function due to decreased r, i.e., increased demand range. Then the numerator ofδC(δQ),N(δQ)=∫Q∗Q{F(x)-ξ}dx=∫Q∗Q(Q-x)f(x)dxdecreases, thereby decreasingδC(δQ). Behavior of theN(cv)curves ascvchanges can be explained similarly.Whenξis large,Q∗is large too. ThenQ=Q∗(1+δQ)is at a greater distance fromQ∗compared to the case whenξis small. A larger|Q-Q∗|increasesN(δQ)=∫Q∗Q{F(x)-ξ}dx, thereby increasingδC(δQ). This explains the behavior of theN(cv)curves and the lower bound asξchanges. This behavior is mainly due to the choice of measurement for deviation. We may not observe the same pattern if deviation is measured by change in value.We have showed that penalty for deviating from the optimum is quite high in the newsvendor model. We took±30%as the error range in the demonstration of the lower bound of cost deviation. The error range can vary from situation to situation. Our conclusions hold if the error range is larger or somewhat smaller. However, if the error range is very small, say±5%, some of our conclusions may not hold. Thus, we need to examine if such possibilities are common or not. In this section, we briefly study the magnitude of order quantity deviation.LetZ=(X-μ)/σdenote the standardized random variable associated with X.E[Z]=0andVar(Z)=1. LetFzdenote the distribution function associated with Z.Fz(z)=F(μ+zσ). The optimal order quantity in the newsvendor problem can be expressed asQ∗=μ+σFz-1(ξ). The operational order quantity is given byQ^∗=μ^+σ^Fz-1(ξ^). We assume that the form of demand distribution is correctly known. Using these expressions, order quantity deviationδQ=(Q^∗-Q∗)/Q∗can be expressed asδQ=(μ^-μ)+{σ^Fz-1(ξ^)-σFz-1(ξ)}μ+σFz-1(ξ).Writingμ^=μ(1+δμ),σ^=σ(1+δσ), andξ^=ξ(1+δξ)and dividing the numerator and the denominator byμ, we get(13)δQ=δμ+cv{(1+δσ)Fz-1(ξ(1+δξ))-Fz-1(ξ)}1+cvFz-1(ξ).The above expression can be rewritten asδQ=(δμ+cvδσ×ξ)/{1+cvFz-1(ξ)}whereδσ×ξ=(1+δσ)Fz-1(ξ(1+δξ))-Fz-1(ξ)is the combined effect ofδσandδξ. Impact ofδμandδσ×ξonδQis straight forward;δQincreases in both. Ifcv<1and magnitudes ofδμandδσ×ξare of same level, impact ofδμis stronger than that ofδσ×ξ. Thus, mean demand may be the most influential parameter in the newsvendor model.δσandδξtogether determineδσ×ξ, whileδξis determined by interaction ofδcoandδcu.δξ=ξ^/ξ-1can be expressed asδξ=cuˆ(co+cu)(coˆ+cuˆ)cu-1=cuˆco-cucoˆ(coˆ+cuˆ)cu=(cuˆ/cu)-(coˆ/co)(coˆ/co)+(cu/co)(cuˆ/cu).Writingco^=co(1+δco)andcu^=cu(1+δcu), we get(14)δξ=δcu-δco(1+δco)+ξ1-ξ(1+δcu)=(1-ξ)(δcu-δco)1+ξδcu+(1-ξ)δco.Two properties ofδξcan be readily observed: (i) highξleads to lower magnitude ofδξcompared to lowξand (ii) same signs ofδcuandδcoleads to lower magnitude ofδξcompared to opposite signs. Our demonstration in Table 3confirms these observations.Table 3 demonstrates values ofδQin different deviation scenarios for normal demand distribution withcv=0.25(no truncation). We took|δμ|=|δσ|=|δcu|=|δco|=10%.Δ=cvδσ×ξrepresents the joint impact ofδσandδξonδQ.δQ, in Table 3, varies form −17.9% to 17.3, while|δQ|varies from 4.4% to 17.9%. Clearly, order quantity deviation is not very small in magnitude. It is comparable with the error in model parameters.Mean demand emerged as the most influential parameter as|δμ|>|Δ|in every scenario. Moreover, the signs ofδμandδQare always same. It can also be noticed that|δQ|is higher whenδμandδξare of same sign. This happens when deviation pattern of (δμ,δcu,δco) is(-,-,+)or(+,+,-)(highlighted rows in Table 3). However, we cannot be conclusive about these observations. A thorough investigation is required for this purpose.In this demonstration, we considered common situations, i.e., common parameter and error values. We did not find order quantity deviation to be very low. Hence, in general, our conclusions about robustness of the newsvendor model hold.
