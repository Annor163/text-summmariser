@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Evaluating teaching performance is a main means to improve teaching quality and can plays an important role in strengthening the management of higher education institutions. In this paper, we present a novel framework for teaching performance evaluation based on the combination of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Specifically, after determining the factors and sub-factors, the teaching performance index system was established. In the index system, the factor and sub-factor weights were then estimated by the extent analysis fuzzy AHP method. Employing the fuzzy AHP method in group decision-making can facilitate a consensus of decision-makers and reduce uncertainty. On the basis of the system, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method was employed to evaluate teaching performance. A case application was also used to illustrate the proposed framework. The application of this framework can make the evaluation results more scientific, accurate, and objective. It is expected that this work may serve as an assistance tool for managers of higher education institutions in improving the educational quality level.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
To improve their competitiveness level in the higher education system, universities need to provide their best services to meet the social demands. Good service can enhance the satisfaction level of students and graduates, and can attract more prospective students. A university can only provide the best service to the community if it commits to continuous quality improvement [1]. Many universities have committed to ongoing improvement and thus must evaluate the activities and services they provide. Teaching is always one of the major tasks of all universities. Therefore, quality teaching should always be one of the primary objectives for higher education institutions, and consequently, there is a need to evaluate teaching performance. The aims of evaluating teaching performance are to develop each lecturer's professionalism, to encourage self-improvement, and to maintain achievements. Evaluating teaching performance is not an easy task, as it involves human decision-making, which is imprecise, vague, and uncertain. Hence, using a scientific method to evaluate teaching performance comprehensively and effectively plays a crucial role in determining the quality of the teaching performance.In recent years, several researchers have focused on evaluating teaching performance in universities. He et al. [2] presented an approach for teaching performance evaluation based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The results of the evaluation can reflect the teaching quality more objectively. Dong and Dai [3] combined fuzzy and neuron network to evaluate teaching quality. They used historical data as a standard indicator to train the neuron network. The combined method has been a good application of fuzzy theory in evaluating teaching performance. Ramli et al. [4] proposed an approach of teaching performance evaluation with outlier data using fuzzy approach. Their method provided an accurate evaluation of teaching performance. The studies we examined all provide good applications of mathematical models in performance evaluations. However, these studies did not give adequate consideration to the design of a scientific evaluation index system. Apart from aforementioned studies, most of the other related research concentrated on strategies and theories of teaching performance evaluation, while few were devoted to the quantitative analysis of the evaluation index system.Since we realize that the key to evaluation process is to design the evaluation index system, our study concentrates on the establishment of a teaching performance evaluation index system with reasonable and objective factor weights. Determining the weight of a factor is related to the multiple-criteria decision-making problem, and the decision-makers usually feel more confident giving linguistic variables rather than expressing their judgments in the form of numeric values. Hence, fuzzy set theory is a useful tool to deal with imprecise and uncertain data. While, AHP, proposed by Satty [5], is a practical decision-making method. Being an extension of AHP, fuzzy AHP is able to solve the hierarchical fuzzy decision-making problems. The fuzzy AHP method has been widely used by various researchers to solve different decision-making problems. Mikhailov and Tsvetinov [6] used fuzzy AHP to deal with the uncertainty and imprecision of the service evaluation process. Gungor et al. [7] proposed a personnel selection system based on fuzzy AHP that evaluated the best and most adequate personnel dealing with the rating of both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Chou et al. [8] employed fuzzy AHP to evaluate the weighting for each criterion in human resource for science and technology. Fuzzy AHP has been also used to combine with other techniques to solve real-life decision-making problems. A combination of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy Kano was proposed to optimize product varieties for smart cameras [9]. In the study, fuzzy AHP was efficient to extract customer preferences for core attributes associated with multiple levels of specification when a product is functionally characterized. Taylana et al. [10] utilized fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS to evaluate the construction projects and their overall risks under incomplete and uncertain situations. In their work, fuzzy AHP was used to create favorable weights for the fuzzy linguistic variable of construction projects overall risk. These studies revealed the high applicability of fuzzy AHP for solving practical problems. Therefore, fuzzy AHP is appropriate for determining the weights in the performance evaluation index system. In our study, in order to evaluate teaching performance, a novel framework based on the combination of fuzzy AHP and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is proposed. Specifically, Chang's extent analysis fuzzy AHP method [11,12] is utilized to obtain the factor and sub-factor weights of a teaching performance evaluation index system. On the basis of the system, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation can be applied to evaluate teaching performance.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the Chang's fuzzy AHP method and some related concepts. Section 3 then discusses the framework for designing the evaluation index system. Section 4 deals with establishing the teaching performance evaluation index system and determining the factor and sub-factors weights. Section 5 presents an application of the proposed evaluation index system based on the comprehensive evaluation method; and finally, conclusions are then given in Section 6.Fuzzy set theory [13] was first introduced to deal with the uncertainty due to imprecision or vagueness. A fuzzy setA˜={(x,μA˜(x))|x∈X}is a set of ordered pairs and X is a subset of the real numbers R, whereμA˜(x)is called the membership function which assigns to each object x a grade of membership ranging from zero to one. Since its introduction, fuzzy set theory has been widely applied to address real-world problems in which decision-makers need to analyze and process information that is imprecise. A fuzzy number is a special case of a convex normalized fuzzy set. It is possible to use different fuzzy numbers under various particular situations. Triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are usually adopted to deal with the vagueness of decisions related to the performance levels of alternative choices with respect to each criterion. When the two most promising values of a trapezoidal fuzzy number are the same number, it becomes a TFN. This means that a TFN is a special case of a trapezoidal fuzzy number. Because of its intuitive appeal and computational efficiency, the TFN is the most widely used membership function for many applications. TFNs are usually employed to capture the vagueness of the parameters related to the decision-making process. In order to reflect the fuzziness which surrounds the decision-makers when they conduct a pairwise comparison matrix, TFN is expressed with boundaries instead of crisp numbers. A triangular fuzzy number, denoted asA˜=(l,m,u), has the following membership function:(1)μA˜(x)=x−lm−lforl≤x≤mu−xu−mform≤x≤u0otherwiseA triangular fuzzy numberA˜is shown in Fig. 1. The parameter “m” is the most promising value. The parameters “l” and “u”, respectively, are the smallest possible value and the largest possible value; they limit the field of possible evaluation. When l=m=u, the triangular fuzzy number becomes a non-fuzzy number. The triplet (l, m, u) can be used to describe a fuzzy event.Consider two TFNsA˜1andA˜2,A˜1=(l1,m1,u1)andA˜2=(l2,m2,u2). The main operational laws [14] for two triangular fuzzy numbersA˜1andA˜2are as follows:(2)A˜1⊕A˜2=(l1+l2,m1+m2,u1+u2)(3)A˜1⊗A˜2≈(l1l2,m1m2,u1u2),forli>0,mi>0,ui>0,i=1,2(4)A˜1/A˜2=(l1/u2,m1/m2,u1/l2),forli>0,mi>0,ui>0,i=1,2(5)A˜1−1≈(1/u1,1/m1,1/l1),forl1>0,m1>0,u1>0There are several fuzzy AHP methods reported in the literature. Buyukozkan et al. [15] gave a comparison of different fuzzy AHP methods. The comparison included the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Among different AHP methods, Chang's method [11,12] has been widely used in different application areas, such as supplier selection problems [16]. This method uses linguistic variables to express the comparative judgments made by different makers. It requires lower computation complexity than the other methods when implementing. In this study, we employed this method to get the factor and sub-factor weights from expert's opinion as making pairwise comparisons.LetA˜=(a˜ij)n×mbe a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix, wherea˜ij=(lij,mij,uij). The steps of the Chang's method can be described as follows:Initially, the value of the fuzzy synthetic extent with respect to the ith object is defined as:(6)Si=∑j=1mMij⊗∑i=1n∑j=1mMij−1,with(7)∑j=1mMij=∑j=1mlij,∑j=1mmij,∑j=1muij,i=1,2,…,n(8)∑i=1n∑j=1mMij=∑i=1n∑j=1mlij,∑i=1n∑j=1mmij,∑i=1n∑j=1muij(9)∑i=1N∑j=1mMij−1=1∑i=1n∑j=1muij,1∑i=1n∑j=1mmij,1∑i=1n∑j=1mlijSecondly, the values of Siare compared and the degree of possibility of Sj=(lj, mj, uj)≥Si=(li, mi, ui) is calculated. This can be equivalently expressed as follows:(10)V(Sj≥Si)=height(Si∩Sj)=1ifmj≥mi0ifli≥ujli−uj(mj−uj)−(mi−li)otherwise.Fig. 2represents V(Sj≥Si), for the case mj<li<uj<mi, where d is the abscissa value of the highest intersection point between Sjand Si. We need both the values V(Sj≥Si) and V(Si≥Sj) to compare Siand Sj. The minimum degree of possibility d(i) of V(Sj≥Si) for i, j=1, 2, 3 …, k is calculated as follows.(11)V(S≥S1,S2,S3,…,Sk),fori=1,2,3,…,k=V[(S≥S1)and(S≥S2)and…(S≥Sk)]=minV(S≥Si),fori=1,2,3,…,k.Assume thatd′(Ai)=minV(S≥Si), for i=1, 2, 3, …, k. Then the weight vector is defined as:(12)W′=(d′(A1),d′(A2),…,d′(An))T,where Ai(i=1, 2, 3, …, n) comprises n elements.Finally, the weight vectors are normalized as follows:(13)W=(W1,W2,…,Wn)T,where W1, W2, …, Wnare non-fuzzy numbers.In order to search for a consensus, it is necessary to establish a representative and democratic decision-making process when designing the evaluation index system. The proposed framework is composed of the following steps.The hierarchical structure is constructed by combining all the factors and sub-factors specific to the research problem. Based on the identified factors and sub-factors, the hierarchical structure for evaluation is obtained.A committee of decision-makers is formed. In order to obtain an objective decision, the background of decision-makers should be considered. Decision-makers are experts who have experience with the research topic. Each member in the committee is required to provide judgments on the basis of personal knowledge and expertise. The decision-makers have to determine the relative weights of factors and sub-factors.The decision-makers make pairwise comparisons of the importance or preference between each pair of factors. Consider a problem at a level with n elements. Each set of pairwise comparisons for a level requires n(n−1)/2 judgments, which are further used to construct a positive fuzzy reciprocal comparison matrix. The comparison of one factor over another can be done with the help of questionnaires, which are in the form of linguistic variables. A linguistic variable is a variable whose values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial language. In this paper, TFNs are used to represent subjective pairwise comparisons of decision-makers, namely, “just equal”, “equally important”, “weakly more important”, “strongly more important”, “very strongly more important” and “absolutely more important”. The triangular fuzzy conversion scales and linguistic scales, which are proposed by Kahraman et al. [17], are used to convert such linguistic values into fuzzy scales, as is demonstrated in Fig. 3and Table 1.Consider a problem at one level with n factors, where the relative importance of factor i to j is represented by triangular fuzzy numbersa˜ij=(lij,mij,uij). One decision-maker considers factor i is strongly more important as compared with factor j; he/she may seta˜ij=(3/2,2,5/2). If factor j is thought to be strongly more important than factor i, the pairwise comparison between i and j could be presented bya˜ij=(2/5,1/2,2/3). As in the traditional AHP, the comparison matrixA˜={a˜ij}can be constructed as:(14)A˜=1a˜12...a˜1na˜211...a˜2n............a˜n1a˜n2...1=1a˜12...a˜1n1/a˜121...a˜2n............1/a˜1n1/a˜2n...1.To assure a certain quality level of a decision, the consistency of an evaluation has to be analyzed. Saaty [5] proposed an index to measure consistency. This index can be used to indicate the consistency of the pairwise comparison matrices. To investigate their consistency, the fuzzy comparison matrices need to be converted into crisp matrices [18]. There are several defuzzification methods [11,19,20] are for obtaining a crisp number from the triangular fuzzy number. In this work, the method proposed by Chang et al. [21] is utilized to defuzzify the fuzzy numbers. This method can clearly express fuzzy perception. Owing to the display of the preference (α) and risk tolerance (λ) of decision-makers, the decision-makers can understand the uncertainties they face under different circumstances. A triangular fuzzy number denoted asa˜ij=(lij,mij,uij)can be defuzzified to a crisp number as follows.(15)(aijα)λ=[λ⋅lijα+(1−λ)uijα],0≤λ≤1,0≤α≤1,wherelijα=(mij−lij)×α+lij, denotes the left-end value of α-cut for aij,uijα=uij−(uij−mij)×αdenotes the right-end value of α-cut for aij. Remarkably, α can be considered as a stable or fluctuating condition, and is any value from 0 to 1. The decision-making environment stabilizes when increasing α. The degree of uncertainty is the highest when α=0. Additionally, λ can be considered as the degree of a decision-maker's optimism and its range is between 0 and 1. When λ is 0, the decision-maker is highly optimistic. Conversely, when λ is 1, the decision-maker is pessimistic.After all the elements in the comparison matrix are converted from triangular fuzzy numbers to crisp numbers, the comparison matrix is now expressed as follows:(16)(Aα)λ=(aij)λ=1(a12α)λ...(a1nα)λ(a21α)λ1...(a2nα)λ............(an1α)λ(an2α)λ...1.The consistence index (CI) for a comparison matrix can be computed with the use of the following equation.(17)CI=λmax−nn−1,where λmax is the largest eigenvalue of the comparison matrix, n is the dimension of the matrix.The consistency ratio (CR) is defined as a ratio between the consistency of a given evaluation matrix and consistency of a random matrix [5].(18)CR=CIRI(n),where RI(n) is a random index [22] that depends on the size of matrix n, as shown in Table 2.If the CR of a comparison matrix is equal or less than 0.1, it can be acceptable. When the CR is unacceptable, the decision-maker is encouraged to repeat the pairwise comparisons. In this step, the MATLAB package can be employed to calculate the eigenvalues of all comparison matrices.Each individual judgment matrix represents the opinion of one decision-maker. Aggregation is necessary to achieve a group consensus of decision-makers. In the conventional AHP, there are two basic approaches for aggregating the individual preferences into a group preference, namely, aggregation of individual judgments (AIJ) and aggregation of individual priorities (AIP) [23]. The concepts and ideas employed in the conventional AHP can also be utilized in the fuzzy AHP. In the AIJ approach, the group judgment matrix is obtained from the individual judgment matrices. This means that the group judgment matrix is considered as the judgment matrix of a “new individual” and the priorities of this individual are derived as a group solution. However, in the AIP approach, the group members act individually. Specifically, from the individual judgment matrices, we obtain the individual priorities, and then from these, the group priorities. AIJ is most often performed using geometric mean operations, whereas, AIP is typically performed using arithmetic mean operations. Geometric mean operations are commonly used within the application of the AHP for aggregating group decisions, and only the geometric mean satisfies the Pareto principle (unanimity condition) and homogeneity condition. Hence, in this research, the AIJ approach is utilized for the aggregation of group decisions.Consider a group of K decision-makers involved in the research: they make pairwise comparisons of n elements. As a result of the pairwise comparisons, we get a set of K matrices,A˜k={a˜ijk}, wherea˜ijk=(lijk,mijk,uijk)represents a relative importance of element i to j, as assessed by the expert k. The triangular fuzzy numbers in the group judgment matrix can be obtained by using the following equation [24]:(19)lij=mink=1,2,…,K(lijk)mij=∏k=1KmijkKuij=maxk=1,2,…,K(uijk)Through the use of the extent analysis fuzzy AHP method, factor and sub-factor weights can be calculated from group decision matrices.It is necessary to design the evaluation index system from different angles and levels for revealing the teaching performance accurately. However, designing teaching evaluation indexes is not an easy task [25] because there are many factors to impact the teaching performance and they are at different levels with different relative importance weights. In order to have the correct and objective evaluation results, the sources of data used to evaluate teaching performance are students, colleagues, and teachers themselves [26]. Hence, the index system used in the evaluation process should have the capability of getting their opinions of teaching performance quality. Some organizations have produced guidelines which provide criteria for teaching performance evaluation in universities [27]. In this work, the hierarchical structure of teaching performance evaluation index system is derived from the criteria proposed by Brooker et al. [28]. The selected factors and sub-factors were discussed and revised by managers and experienced lecturers at educational institutions. The final hierarchical structure was then achieved, as shown in Table 3. It consists of six factors: “planning and preparation”, “communication and interaction”, “teaching for learning”, “managing the learning environment”, “student evaluation” and “professionalism”, each of which is divided into two or more sub-factors.In developing a performance evaluation system, the factor and sub-factor weights must be significantly considered [29]. Our study is related to the teaching performance evaluation of higher education in Vietnam. To acquire the factor and sub-factor weights, a group of 17 decision-makers, including institution managers and experienced lecturers, was formed. Questionnaires were provided to get their viewpoints. Pairwise comparisons, which were derived from their assessments on the relative importance of one factor over another, were used to form the comparison matrices of each decision-maker. By employing Eq. (19), the geometric mean method was then applied to get the representative comparison matrix of the group. The representative comparison matrix of the group acquired when making pairwise comparisons of the factors is shown in Table 4.The next step we calculated the consistency ratio of the comparison matrix. Decision-makers can determine the α-cut subjectivity, depending on environmental uncertainty. In our study, α=0.5 was used to denote that environmental uncertainty is steady, and λ=0.5 expresses that the attitude is fair. Taking pairwise comparison matrix of the factors in Table 4 as an example, when α and λ=0.5, the defuzzification was performed as follows:l120.5=(1.317−0.5)×0.5+0.5=0.9085u120.5=2.5−(2.5−1.317)×0.5=1.9085(a120.5)0.5=0.5×0.9085+(1−0.5)×1.9085=1.409Following a similar calculation, we get all the elements in the crisp comparison matrix, and they are shown in Table 5.By employing Eqs. (17) and (18), the CR value of the crisp comparison matrix is 0.049. Hence, it is acceptable.When making comparisons all sub-factors at the corresponding level with respect to the upper level factors, the comparison matrices of decision-makers at the corresponding level were derived. The representative matrices were then obtained and they are shown in Tables 6–11. Then, the CR values for all matrices were determined by making the same calculations like in Tables 4 and 5. From the results of the consistency test of the comparison matrices by each decision-maker and the representative matrices, it was found that they are all less than 10%. Therefore, the consistency in each matrix is acceptable.The fuzzy AHP was then employed to identify the factor and sub-factor weights. By taking pairwise comparison matrix of the factors in Table 4 as an example, the factor weights were calculated as follows:Using Eqs. (6)–(9), we determined TFN values of the six output indicators as follows:S1=(4.4,7.282,12)⊗162,136.734,122.833=(0.071,0.198,0.526)S2=(3.3,5.564,8.5)⊗162,136.734,122.833=(0.053,0.151,0.372)S3=(3.5,7.238,12.5)⊗162,136.734,122.833=(0.056,0.197,0.547)S4=(4.333,5.787,10)⊗162,136.734,122.833=(0.07,0.158,0.438)S5=(3.633,5.19,9)⊗162,136.734,122.833=(0.059,0.141,0.394)S6=(3.667,5.673,10)⊗162,136.734,122.833=(0.059,0.154,0.438)The values of Siwere individually compared and the degree of possibility of Sj=(lj, mj, uj)≥Si=(li, mi, ui) were then identified by the use of Eq. (10)Table 12shows the values of V(Si≥Sj).Thereafter, we determined the minimum degree of possibility d′(i) of V(Si≥Sj) for i, j=1, 2, …, 6 by using Eq. (11).d′(1)=minV(S1≥S2,S3,S4,S5,S6)=1d′(2)=minV(S2≥S1,S3,S4,S5,S6)=0.866d′(3)=minV(S3≥S1,S2,S4,S5,S6)=0.998d′(4)=minV(S4≥S1,S2,S3,S5,S6)=0.9d′(5)=minV(S5≥S1,S2,S3,S4,S6)=0.85d′(6)=minV(S6≥S1,S2,S3,S4,S5)=0.893Therefore, the weight vector was obtained by the use of Eq. (12),W′=(1,0.866,0.998,0.9,0.85,0.893)T.We then normalized the weight vectors using Eq. (13) and obtained the relative weights of the six factors,W=(WU1,WU2,WU3,WU4,WU5,WU6)T=(0.182,0.157,0.181,0.163,0.154,0.162)T,where W is a non-fuzzy number.The calculation results show that the weight of “planning and preparation (U1)” is largest. Hence, this factor plays the most important part in teaching performance, followed by “teaching for learning”.Following a similar calculation, the weight vectors W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, W6, of sub-factors at the successive level were determined. They are as shown below:The weight vector from Table 6 was calculated asW1=(WU11,WU12)T=(0.454,0.546)T.The weight vector from Table 7 was calculated asW2=(WU21,WU22)T=(0.551,0.449)T.The weight vector from Table 8 was calculated asW3=(WU31,WU32,WU33)T=(0.367,0.331,0.302)T.The weight vector from Table 9 was calculated asW4=(WU41,WU42)T=(0.663,0.337)T.The weight vector from Table 10 was calculated asW5=(WU51,WU52)T=(0.315,0.685)T.The weight vector from Table 11 was calculated asW6=(WU61,WU62,WU63)T=(0.254,0.297,0.449)T.The above derived weights formed the evaluation matrix R for the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation.From the above teaching evaluation index system and acquired factor and sub-factor weights, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method was utilized to assess the teaching performance. In order to illustrate the method, we took a case application as an illustration.Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation is an application of fuzzy mathematics [30]. It uses the principle of fuzzy transformation and maximum membership degree, evaluating all relevant factors to make a comprehensive evaluation. This is an efficient evaluation method to evaluate objects that are affected by various factors. For objects that are influenced by a few factors, we can use one layer models. If the objects are complicated and the number of the factors is large, we can use models with two or more layers. In this paper, we used a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model with two layers as a tool for teaching performance evaluation. The application steps of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation can be described as follows:Step 1: Establishing the evaluation index systemAccording to the nature of the characteristics of the evaluation index system, the factor set in the evaluating relationship is as follows: U={u1, u2, u3, …, un}. In Section 4, the teaching performance evaluation system was established and the factor and sub-factor weights were calculated.Step 2: Determining the set of commentsThe evaluation comment set is as follows: V={v1, v2, v3, …, vm}. In this study, we used five grades to set up the comments for evaluation: V={excellent, very good, good, fair, poor}.In order to make the index quantitative, we provided grade for the corresponding comment sheet: V=(100, 85, 70, 55, 40).Step 3: Establishing the single-factor evaluation matrix R from U to VEach factor ui(i≤n) should be evaluated as a single-factor. As there are different types of evaluation levels, the evaluation result of each factor is a fuzzy set of evaluation set V which can be written as the fuzzy vectorRi=(ri1,ri2,ri3,…,rim),i=1,2,…,n,Ri∈μ(V). The results of these evaluations meet the normalized conditions and the sum of the weight of the vector is 1, that is, for every i, there is:ri1+ri2+ri3+⋯+rim=1.All of the single-factor evaluations constitute the fuzzy relationship R from U to V:R=(rij)n×m. That is(20)R=(rij)n×m=r11r12r13...r1mr21r22r23...r2m...............rn1rn2rn3...rnm,rijpresents the grade of membership of factor uiaiming at the comment vj.Step 4: Determining the factor weightsWeight means the proportion of each evaluation factor in the evaluation index system based on relative importance. If a weight is given to an element, the weight distribution set W can be seen as a fuzzy set of set U. How to determine the weight of each factor is the core task of the evaluation system. As discussed in Section 4, we employed fuzzy AHP to determine the factor and sub-factor weights in the evaluation index system.Step 5: Producing the evaluation resultThe results of evaluation can be obtained through multiplying the vector of the factor weight and the matrix R of single-factor evaluation:(21)B=W⋅R=(b1,b2,b3,…,bm),where B is the evaluation result based on all factors in the index system U. The k-th element bkis membership of the evaluation object with regard to k-th element in the comment set. The conclusion of the comprehensive evaluation can be obtained by the maximum membership principle.We took a case application from one Vietnamese public university as an illustration. At every Vietnamese university, teaching performance evaluation is conducted every academic semester. The objective of teaching evaluation is to provide information and feedback to lecturers in order to improve the teaching quality. However, the existing evaluation method is mainly based on the acquisition of knowledge. This method has not been suitable for lifetime education or for deepening and widening education reform. In addition, the evaluation procedure is largely a formality, and lacks accuracy and objectivity. Inaccuracy of evaluation work is due to the lack of a standard accompanied by criteria as well as a method to evaluate the performance of each faculty member. Therefore, the need for a scientific evaluation method with objective and accurate results is essential.The application was carried out in evaluating the teaching performance of a lecturer at the University of Transport Technology in Vietnam when his “Digital Technique” course for the 2011–2012 academic year finished. According to the evaluation index system and the comment set proposed in the previous sections, we collected opinions of students and colleagues about his teaching performance and investigated his teaching portfolio. The evaluation matrices of indexes were then formed. Taking the constructing the matrix R1 as an example, when “clear goals and objectives” was considered, 27% of respondents rated it “excellent”, 44% of respondents rated it “very good”, 29% rated it “good”, and 0% rated it “fair” or “poor”; when “clear, logical, and innovative documentation” was considered, 23% of respondents rated it “excellent”, 51% of respondents rated it “very good”, 22% rated it “good”, 4% rated it “fair”, and 0% rated it “poor”. Hence, the matrix R1 can be derived as follows:R1=0.270.440.29000.230.510.220.040Similarly, the matrix R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 were obtained. They are as shown below:R2=0.160.670.17000.130.620.190.060R3=0.020.520.220.2400.460.350.19000.370.590.0500R4=0.060.380.56000.210.750.0500R5=0.120.580.230.08000.110.240.650R6=00.730.130.1300.10.630.120.1500.050.410.350.190Then we can get the evaluation result of U1B1=W1⋅R1=(0.454,0.546)⋅0.270.440.29000.230.510.220.040=(0.248,0.478,0.253,0.021,0)Similarly, we got the evaluation result of U2, U3, U4, U5, and U6 through calculationsB2=W2⋅R2=(0.144,0.645,0.182,0.029,0)B3=W3⋅R3=(0.268,0.485,0.159,0.087,0)B4=W4⋅R4=(0.112,0.504,0.384,0,0)B5=W5⋅R5=(0.036,0.258,0.236,0.47,0)B6=W6⋅R6=(0.053,0.557,0.224,0.166,0)We established the evaluation matrix R at the first level from the above matrices as follows:R=B1B2B3B4B5B6=0.2480.4780.2530.02100.1440.6450.1820.02900.2680.4850.1590.08700.1120.5040.384000.0360.2580.2360.4700.0530.5570.2240.1660The evaluation matrix R represents the membership degree values of each comment, which is correlative with each factor in the evaluation index. Hence, the comprehensive evaluation of his teaching performance is calculated as:B=W⋅R=(0.182,0.157,0.181,0.163,0.154,0.162)⋅0.2480.4780.2530.02100.1440.6450.1820.02900.2680.4850.1590.08700.1120.5040.384000.0360.2580.2360.4700.0530.5570.2240.1660=(0.149,0.488,0.239,0.123,0)The result shows that the “very good” probability of the teaching performance is 0.488; the probability of “excellent”, “good”, “fair” and “poor” is 0.149, 0.239, 0.123 and 0 respectively. According to the maximum membership degree principle, the comprehensive evaluation result of the lecturer's teaching performance is “very good”. In addition, another implication from the distribution of B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and B6 vector weights is that his achievements regarding “Student evaluation” and “Professionalism” factors are not good as those for other factors. The evaluation result, which is based on the opinions of students and peers, also provided the lecturer with suggestions on how to improve his teaching quality. We interviewed the Dean of the Department and the faculty members about the evaluation result. They all agreed that the evaluation result obtained by the proposed framework is more transparent and objective. Furthermore, the proposed method makes it easier to explain the results to the lecturer and it also provides institution managers with useful information. The information collected in the evaluation process can aid in maintaining and enhancing the teaching quality of the educational institution. Therefore, the application of this method can improve the overall quality and promote academic excellence in each university and in the education system as a whole.
