Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) are highly polymorphic proteins that play a key role in the immune system. HLA molecule is present on the cell membrane of antigen-presenting cells of the immune system and presents short peptides, originating from the proteins of invading pathogens or self-proteins, to the T-cell Receptor (TCR) molecule of the T-cells. In this study, peptide-binding characteristics of HLA-B*44:02, 44:03, 44:05 alleles bound to three nonameric peptides were studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Polymorphisms among these alleles (Asp116Tyr and Asp156Leu) result in major differences in the allele characteristics. While HLA-B*44:02 (Asp116, Asp156) and HLA-B*44:03 (Asp116, Leu156) depend on tapasin for efficient peptide loading, HLA-B*44:05 (Tyr116, Asp156) is tapasin independent. On the other hand, HLA-B*44:02 and HLA-B*44:03 mismatch is closely related to transplant rejection and acute-graft-versus-host disease. In order to understand the dynamic characteristics, the simulation trajectories were analyzed by applying Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) calculations and hydrogen bonding analysis. Binding dynamics of the three HLA-B*44 alleles and peptide sequences are comparatively discussed. In general, peptide binding stability is found to depend on the peptide rather than the allele type for HLA-B*44 alleles.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are heterodimer cell membrane proteins consisting of a highly polymorphic heavy chain (α-chain), a light chain, β2-microglobulin and a peptide. Forming highly stable complexes with the peptides, they have roles in the recognition of the peptides by T cells. Peptides are generally between 8 and 11 amino acids in length and have allele-specific anchor residues at certain positions (Falk et al., 1991). Due to the large number of available peptide binders leading to tremendous number of possible peptide-MHC complexes, the immune system is challenged to respond to a wide variety of complexes (Madden, 1995). Studies on MHC molecule have been accomplished from past to present due to the importance of MHC molecule in the immune response to foreign antigens (Ostermeir et al., 2015).HLA encoded genes are the most polymorphic genes in the whole genome, while polymorphisms affect the specific region for peptide binding region. Polymorphism occurring in the peptide binding region of the HLA molecule is important for antigen presentation and recognition of antigens by T cells. Additionally, polymorphisms for HLA class I molecules are also known to affect the Tapasin dependency (Macdonald et al., 2002), which is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in the stabilization of peptide receptive state of HLA class I molecules (Badrinath et al., 2014). Tapasin exerts an optimizing influence and is correlated with the rate of peptide dissociation from class I molecules. The dependence to Tapasin is still an unsolved issue, and it is still not known why some alleles depend on tapasin while the others don’t (Garstka et al., 2011). In this respect, HLA-B44 family has been under investigation (Garstka et al., 2011; Ostermeir et al., 2015; Ostermeir and Zacharias, 2014; Sieker et al., 2007, 2008) since they display varying Tapasin dependencies. Among HLA-B*44:02/03/05, there are two polymorphic positions, 116 and 156 (HLA-B*44:02; Asp116, Asp156; HLA-B*44:03; Asp116, Leu156; HLA-B*44:05; Tyr116, Asp156). Residue 116 is buried at the bottom of the F-pocket (formed by residues 95, 97, 116, 118) on the floor of the antigen binding cleft contributing to the peptide binding, away from the tapasin binding region (residues 134, 229 and 229 (Suh et al., 1999; Zernich et al., 2004)) and 156 is located on the α2 helix forming part of the D/E pocket (Ostermeir et al., 2015) (Fig. 1). HLA-B*44:02 and HLA-B*44:03 mismatch is closely related to transplant rejection and acute-graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The polymorphic position 156 is known to be one of the most non-permissive transplantation mismatches (Badrinath et al., 2012). Additionally, HLA-B*44:02 and HLA-B*44:03 show tapasin dependence during peptide loading (Thammavongsa et al., 2006), while HLA-B*44:05 is tapasin independent (Zernich et al., 2004).In this study, the dynamics of peptide binding on HLA-B*44:02/03/05 alleles bound to three different peptides was examined via 20ns molecular dynamics simulations. Root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) profiles as well as hydrogen bonding were investigated for the polymorphic HLA molecules bound to the same peptide.HLA-B*44 alleles are the most commonly processed alleles for antigen presentation because of their polymorphic properties related to varying tapasin dependency and transplant rejection. Table 1lists the molecules examined in this study along with their respective polymorphic residues. The structures of the complexes were retrieved from protein data bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000). Although binding to the same peptide, the conformations of the peptides show small variations among the alleles as well. Structures are displayed in Fig. 1.20ns molecular dynamics simulations were conducted on the 9 structures given in Table 1. A total of 18 simulations were employed together with the parallel runs. MD simulations were performed with NAMD 2.9 (Phillips et al., 2005) using CHARMM 27 force field. An integration time step of 2fs was used. Langevin Dynamics was used to keep temperature and pressure stable at 310K and 101.3kPa. The structure was surrounded by water molecules with a solvent area shaped as a rectangular box with 10Å padding. The system was ionized with Na and Cl ions. Periodic boundary conditions were applied and Particle Mesh Ewald summation (Darden et al., 1993) with 12Å cutoff distance for non-bonded interaction energies was used during the simulations.For the determination of the overall stability of simulations, time evolution of the root-mean square deviation (RMSD) of backbone atoms with respect to the initial structure was monitored. Further detailed analysis (RMSF and hydrogen bonding between the peptide and the binding groove residues) was employed on the simulations after the determination of the equilibrium time step. Details of the calculations are given in Supplementary Material. The analyses were conducted using VMD program (Humphrey et al., 1996) packages. For hydrogen analysis, a distance of 3Å and an angle cut-off of 20° is used.
