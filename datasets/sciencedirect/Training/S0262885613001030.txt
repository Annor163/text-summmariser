Recognizing hand gestures using the weighted elastic graph matching (WEGM) method

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The HEGM method for classifying hand postures with a hit rate of 97.08% on average over uniform and complex backgrounds.This method allows computing only features corresponding to highly discriminative nodes, thus decreasing computing time.A semi-automatic technique to annotate bunch graphs is described which is efficient and leads to faster graph creation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
One of the main goals in the human–computer interaction (HCI) field is the study of innovative ways to enhance the user experience through natural communication and develop the technology that enables such interaction. In this context, new trends include the development of a new generation of smaller, cheaper and versatile sensors [1,2]. Users' subjective satisfaction favors those systems that provide an enhanced interaction experience based on the naturalness and expressiveness that they offer [3]. Among those modalities relying on natural interaction, gestures are found explicitly, as one of the main channels to interact with computers in many fronts; such as sign language interpretation [2], assistive technologies [4], and game control applications [5] to mention a few. Gestures are being adopted also in areas where touch can be a vehicle of infection transmissions (e.g. browsing medical images in the operating room) [6] or in outpatient clinics [7]. Common approaches for vision based-hand posture recognition involve [8] (1) 3D model based methods [9], (2) appearance based model [10], and (3) shape analysis [11]. See [12] for a detailed review on gesture based interfaces.Elastic graph matching (EGM) is a technique used for object recognition [13], where the object is represented by a labeled bunch graph. The bunch graph consists of a connected graph where the most salient features on the image are represented as series of nodes. A bunch graph is built on a set of template images (also called ‘dictionary’). To compare the similarity between one template image within the bunch and a target image, the graph obtained from the template image is matched against the target image. Filter responses are computed at each node in the graph, and a cost function is minimized based on a metric applied to the nodes assignment. Over the years, EGM was implemented for tasks such as face recognition [13,14], face verification [15] and gesture recognition [16]. In Wiskott et al. [13], EGM was used to recognize the facial expressions in images where features were extracted from typical face parts (e.g. the pupils, the beard, the nose, and the corners of the mouth). Triesch et al. employed EGM to develop a classification approach for hand gestures against complex backgrounds [16]. EGM was also shown to have better performance over eigenfaces [17] and auto-association and classification neural networks [18]. EGM outperformed the aforementioned two methods due to its robustness to lighting variation, face position and expression changes. Another variant of EGM is morphological elastic graph matching (MEGM) [19], which was applied for frontal face authentication based on multi-scale dilation–erosion operations. One of the main drawbacks of this method is the computational complexity involved in the detection and classification processes.
