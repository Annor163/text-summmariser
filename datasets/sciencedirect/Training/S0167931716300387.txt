@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As Moore's Law drives the feature size of silicon transistors to a few nanometers, device operation will reach its limits. Therefore, in order to improve future circuit performance, alternative materials and their associated fabrication technologies need to be developed. In the pursuit of new materials for circuits beyond the silicon era, a great deal of attention has been paid to atomically thin materials such as graphene [1], two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) [2] and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) [3–5]. Each of these materials has its own particular physical properties that may play an important role in building high performance devices. For example, graphene is well known for its high carrier mobility [1]. The electron mobility of graphene from kish graphite or highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), prepared by mechanical exfoliation, can reach as high as 15,000cm2V−1s−1 even at room temperature, outperforming that of silicon by ten times. However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that limits its usefulness in certain applications. Some of the TMDs (such as MoS2 and WSe2) have attracted much attention for their high on/off current ratio and low off-state current, due to their intrinsic bandgap [3–5], which is complementary to graphene.Although several large area 2D material synthesis methods, including sublimation of SiC [6] and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [7–11], have been studied extensively, mechanical exfoliation method can produce 2D flakes with better crystal quality and purity [1,4]. Thus, from the fundamental research, device fabrication, and cost points of view, the mechanical exfoliation technique still prevails. However, other characteristics associated with the exfoliated 2D material sheets are the small size (typically in the micron range), the random distribution and orientation of the sheets on the substrate, as well as the irregular shape of the sheets. Such features of exfoliated sheets pose challenges to device fabrication, mainly in two aspects: patterning of the 2D materials and alignment of the metal contacts to the patterned 2D sheets.Thus far, most researchers try to avoid patterning the exfoliated 2D materials and fabricate electronic devices on as-exfoliated pristine 2D materials, which make the dimension of the devices hard to control and limits the practical application of such kind of devices. In addition, electron beam lithography (EBL) is the dominant patterning technique in aligning metal contacts to exfoliated 2D sheets to make electronic devices. However, EBL has some drawbacks. For instance, EBL is a serial process and can take a long time to expose the metal contact openings. Moreover, the electron beam irradiation can induce defects in the 2D sheets [12–14], which may degrade the electrical properties of 2D materials [15,16].In our work, we report the development of the fabrication of devices from exfoliated 2D sheets using optical lithography. The advantage of employing optical lithography lies in the low cost of the process, the speed of exposure and ease of patterning. The key to the successful implementation of the technique is the alignment mark design. The technique has been applied to fabricate electronic devices designed with a field effect transistor (FET) structure – field effect devices (FEDs) – using pre-patterned graphene, few-layer MoS2 and WSe2 sheets as the channels, respectively. To our knowledge, the optical technique reported here is the first of its kind for devices fabricated from exfoliated atomically thin materials.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Optical lithography technique has been applied for the fabrication of electronic devices from randomly distributed and oriented mechanically exfoliated 2D materials (graphene, few-layer MoS2 and WSe2) with random shape. During the development of fabrication processes, patterning of the 2D material channels and the alignment of metal contacts to the patterned 2D channels to make field effect devices have been achieved. The appropriate alignment mark design and implementation are enabling factors in these processes. According to Raman analysis, the 2D materials in the final devices show little defects. From the electrical measurements, the fabricated devices exhibit field effect characteristics, with the extracted mobilities of the 2D channels corresponding to previous reports. The added advantage of the optical technique is that it is fast, cheap and can be applied to the fabrication of devices from any atomically thin exfoliated material.
