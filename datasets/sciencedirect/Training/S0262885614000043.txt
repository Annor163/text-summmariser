@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The recent years have witnessed the continuously explosive growth of the web images, how to annotate these countless web images effectively has become a critical research issue. Usually, images are represented by different types of features, so feature selection is widely used to improve the web image annotation performance. Facing the large-scale web images, traditional feature selection algorithm such as Fisher Score [1] and ReliefF [2] become less effective and efficient because they select features one by one. Recently, sparse feature selection has received a lot of attention in web image annotation [3–6] for achieving better performance. In this paper, we exploit the latest mathematical advance in sparse feature selection to boost web image annotation performance.Recently, sparse feature selection has received mushroom development. The most well-known sparse model is l1-norm (lasso) [7] and Cai et al. have used an l1-regularized regression model to select features jointly [8]. In spite of the computational convenience, sparse feature selection methods based on l1-norm model select features insufficiently sparse sometimes. Much works [9–12] have extended the l1-norm to the lp-norm (0<p<1). In [13] and [14], Xu et al. have proposed that when p is 1/2, the lp-norm, i.e., l1/2-norm regularization has the best performance. However, all of the above methods neglect the useful information of the correlation between different features. In [15], Nie et al. have introduced a joint l2,1-norm minimization on both loss function and regularization for feature selection, which realizes sparse features selection with the correlation between features. In [16] Ma et al. have proposed l2,p-norm (0<p<2) and apply it to the multimedia event detection to remove the shared irrelevance and noise for obtaining a more discriminative event detector. The lower p is, the more correlated are the concept classifier and the event detector. Because lp-norm (0<p<1) can select more sparse features than l1-norm, Wang et al. [17] recently have proposed an idea to extend l2,1-norm to l2,p-matrix norm (0<p≤1) so as to select joint, more sparse features, at the same time this method has better robustness than l2,1-norm. In this paper we propose a novel sparse feature selection method based on l2,1/2-matrix norm and apply it to web image annotation.It is very time-consuming and labor-intensive to label a large number of training data manually, so how to utilize a small number labeled data to annotate large-scale web images becomes a challenging problem. In [18], Yang et al. have proposed to exploit the information shared by multiple related tasks for multimedia content analysis to overcome the limitations of small number labeled data. This work is based on the assumption that the multiple tasks are correlated. However, automatic evaluation of the correlation among multiple tasks is an open problem. Because the unlabeled data are easy to be acquired and are capable of improving the annotation performance, many semi-supervised learning approaches to exploiting small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data have been proposed [19–21]. On one hand, the semi-supervised learning can save human labor cost for labeling a large amount of images, on the other hand, which can make full use the unlabeled data to improve the performance. In this paper we apply semi-supervised learning into large-scale web image annotation by exploiting small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data.In [22], Zhu has reviewed different approaches for semi-supervised learning. Graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning has obtained most research interest and whose key technique is the graph construction. Jebara et al. [23] have proposed to construct the graph by using b-matching, but this method has high computational complexity and is not suitable for large scale web images. Because of the simplicity, the KNN graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning is widely used and many related methods have been proposed for web image annotation. In [6], Ma et al. have proposed a semi-supervised framework built upon feature selection for automatic image annotation. In [19], Yang et al. have proposed a new framework for web image annotation by integrating shared structure learning and graph-based learning into a joint framework. In [20], Tang et al. have proposed a novel kNN-sparse graph-based semi-supervised learning approach to harness the labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously for noisily-tagged web image annotation. In [24], Wang et al. have used the sample reconstruction method to construct a graph for web image annotation. In this paper, we apply KNN graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning into our sparse feature selection framework to build our model.In this paper, we propose a new sparse feature selection framework based on l2,1/2-matrix norm and KNN graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning for web image annotation. We call it sparse Feature Selection based on Graph Laplacian (FSLG). By using the l2,1/2-matrix norm model, FSLG can select more sparse and discriminative features. Additionally, our method utilizes Graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning to exploit small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data for achieving better web image annotation performance. Extensive experiments are performed on NUS-WIDE [25] dataset and MSRA-MM 2.0 [26] dataset and the results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms for web image annotation.The main contributions of our work are as follows:•Sparse Feature Selection based on Graph Laplacian framework is proposed, which utilizes the l2,1/2-matrix norm to select the most sparse and discriminative features and uses the graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning to simultaneously exploit small number labeled data and large number unlabeled data to annotate large-scale web images;A fast iterative algorithm for optimizing the objective function is proposed, and the convergence of the algorithm is proven;Several experiments are conducted on two web image datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review related works, including sparse feature selection, graph based semi-supervised learning and web image annotation. In Section 3, we describe the details of the proposed model FSLG followed by the proposed solution. In Section 4, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the promising performance of our method for web image annotation. The conclusion is given in Section 5.
