@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We consider the One Warehouse Multi-Retailer (OWMR) problem with deterministic time-varying demand in the case where shortages are allowed. Demand may be either backlogged or lost. We present a simple combinatorial algorithm to build an approximate solution from a decomposition of the system into single-echelon subproblems. We establish that the algorithm has a performance guarantee of 3 for the OWMR with backlog under mild assumptions on the cost structure. In addition, we improve this guarantee to 2 in the special case of the Joint-Replenishment Problem (JRP) with backlog. As a by-product of our approach, we show that our decomposition provides a new lower bound of the optimal cost. A similar technique also leads to a 2-approximation for the OWMR problem with lost-sales. In all cases, the complexity of the algorithm is linear in the number of retailers and quadratic in the number of time periods, which makes it a valuable tool for practical applications. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first constant approximations for the OWMR with shortages.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
We consider two multi-echelon inventory control problems: The One Warehouse Multi-Retailer (OWMR) problem and its special case the Joint Replenishment Problem (JRP). Both problems share the same divergent network structure: A single warehouse replenishes N retailers facing customers demands, by ordering material from an external suppliers. Demands are fulfilled by units that are first ordered at the warehouse, then at the retailers. In particular, the ’divergent structure of the system requires that the retailers can only order material that is available (i.e. physically held) at the warehouse. The JRP is a special case of this problem in which the warehouse cannot hold any unit. In this work, we focus on a discrete and deterministic setting by assuming that the demands are known over a finite planning horizon of T periods. Costs are incurred when a location places an order to replenish its stock (ordering costs), when units are physically held in the system (holding costs) or when demand is not immediately satisfied (penalty costs). The goal is then to determine an ordering strategy in order to minimize the total cost incurred to fulfill the demands by moving the products through the network.Most of the existing work on this problem focuses on the case where all demands must be satisfied on time. Even in this simpler setting the OWMR problem and the JRP are both known to be NP-hard (Arkin, Joneja, & Roundy, 1989). Those problems have attracted a lot of attention in the past and many heuristics have been developed. In particular (Levi, Roundy, Shmoys, & Sviridenko, 2008), (Stauffer, Massonnet, Rapine, & Gayon, 2011) and (Bienkowski et al., 2014) introduced constant factor approximation algorithms for the former problem (1.8, 2, 1.791, respectively). We refer to these papers for a detailed review of the corresponding literature. (Nonner & Souza, 2009) have also proposed a 5/3-approximation algorithm for the JRP problem, for the special case where each demand has a strict deadline.In this paper, we focus on extensions of these standard models in which shortages (either backlog or lost sales) are allowed. Such models have been extensively studied in the lot-sizing literature when a single location faces customers demands over a discrete, finite planning horizon. (Zangwill, 1966) was among the first to extend the pioneering work of (Wagner & Whitin, 1958) to incorporate the possibility to backlog units. Later, (Federgruen & Tzur, 1993) and (Aggarwal & Park, 1993) used more advanced dynamic programming techniques to solve the problem and improved the time complexity. An interesting extension of the lot-sizing problem is the multi-item version, which considers that several items are distributed, each incurring its own holding and backlogging costs. Several papers (see (Pochet & Wosley, 1988; 1994) and (Küçükyavuz & Pochet, 2009)) have focused on the integer programming formulation of this problem in the case of single or multiple items. The special case of the JRP is a generalization of the multi-item problem in which additional ordering costs are incurred whenever a specific item replenishes its own stock. (Levi, Roundy, & Shmoys, 2006) developed an algorithm based on primal-dual approach for this problem with backlogging and proved its cost is at most twice the optimal cost in the worst case.The literature on lost sales models is more recent: (Sandbothe & Thompson, 1990) were the first to propose a forward algorithm to solve a lot-sizing problem with production capacity constraints and stockouts. Later, (Aksen, Altinkemer, & Chand, 2003) introduced a dynamic programming approach to solve efficiently the uncapacitated version with time-varying costs. (Liu, Chu, Chu, & Wang, 2007) considered a model where inventory is bounded, present an optimal dynamic program for this model and test it on industrial problem successfully. Other papers deal with the multi-item versions of the basic lot-sizing problem. In particular, (Absi & Kedad-Sidhoum, 2008) extends the original work of (Sandbothe & Thompson, 1990) to a multi-item version and use a MIP approach to develop an effective method to find near optimal solutions.This work extends the decomposition technique of  (Stauffer et al., 2011) to more general models allowing backorders or lost-sales and derive a constant approximation algorithm in each case. We present a new lower bound for each problem, based on a decomposition into simple single-echelon systems. We then recompose the optimal solutions to the subproblems into a feasible solution to the original problem. In the case of the OWMR problem with backlogging, we prove that the cost of the solution obtained is guaranteed to be at most three times the optimal cost under mild assumptions on the cost structure. In addition in the JRP case, some of these assumptions become irrelevant and we show that our algorithm can be modified to match the best known performance guarantee obtained by (Levi et al., 2006) when backorders are allowed. Finally, we adapt our technique to the OWMR problem with lost-sales and build a 2-approximation for this problem. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first constant approximation algorithms for the backlogging and the lost-sales version of the OWMR problem. The complexity of our algorithms is linear with the number of time periods and quadratic with the number of retailers.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formally introduce the assumptions and notations used throughout the following sections. In Section 3, we present the split and uncross technique and provide a 3-approximation algorithm for the backorder version of the OWMR problem. In Section 4, we show that in our cost structure, the lost-sales model is simply a special case of the backlogging problem. We are then able to improve the performance guarantee of our algorithm to two by simply modifying one step of our algorithm.In this section, we focus on models where unmet demand is backordered. In this version of the OWMR problem, demands faced by the retailers are not necessarily satisfied on time but can instead be backlogged and served by an order placed later in time. We now discuss the assumptions and notations used throughout the remainder of the paper. In particular, we present a general cost structure that extends the cost structure introduced in (Levi et al., 2008) and (Stauffer et al., 2011).We consider N retailers that face customers demands over a finite planning horizon, discretized into T periods. For each retaileri=1,…,Nand each periodt=1,…,T,letdtibe the deterministic demand for retailer i in period t, to which we also refer as the demand point (i, t). Each retailer orders units from a central warehouse, which in turn orders from an external supplier. Recall that we assume that the decisions are centralized in order to minimize the total cost incurred by the system. As a consequence, orders placed by the retailers are always filled on time by units coming from the on-hand inventory of the warehouse. If the warehouse orders from its supplier in period t, it incurs a fixed ordering costKt0,regardless of how many units are ordered. Similarly, retailer i pays a fixed ordering costKtifor ordering from the warehouse in period t. (Chan, Muriel, Shen, Simchi-Levi, & Teo, 2000) have shown that if the ordering costs at the retailers vary over time, the OWMR problem is as hard to approximate as the set cover problem and thus admits no constant guarantee unlessP=NP(Feige, 1998). Therefore we assume in this paper that the ordering costs at each retailer i > 0 are stationary, i.e.Kti=Kifor all periodst=1,…,T. The leadtimes are deterministic, thus we assume without loss of generality that the orders are delivered instantaneously from one location to another.The most common assumption in the inventory literature is to consider that holding and backlogging units induce linear costs that are proportional to the inventory level in each location. However, it is worth noticing that the algorithms developed in the following sections only need to satisfy weaker properties to yield a constant performance guarantee for the OWMR problem with backorders. For clarity reasons, we start by introducing the assumptions on the cost structure in the linear case first. We then relate this basic parameters to the so-called metric carrying cost structure and generalize the assumptions to this more complex setting.In the traditional linear cost structure, each unit physically held in location i in period t incurs a holding costhti≥0,while each backlogged unit for a specific retailer i ≥ 1 induces a penalty cost ofbti≥0. Note that we consider that the penalty cost for backlogging a demand is entirely incurred at the retailer, where demands have to be served eventually. In other words, we restrict ourselves to policies in which the warehouse cannot backlog the orders of the retailers, i.e. retailers can only order units that are available at the warehouse. Another common assumption for the OWMR problem is that the set of retailers can be partitioned into two subsets IJand IWsuch that:(1)IJ={i=1,…,N:hti≤ht0forallt}(2)IW={i=1,…,N:hti≥ht0andbti≥ht0forallt}In the remainder of this paper, retailers in set IJare also called J-retailers, while retailers from set IWare called W-retailers. In simple words, it is cheaper to store units at J-retailers than at the warehouse, while it is cheaper to hold units at the warehouse than at W-retailers. Note that in addition we assume that for all i ∈ IWandt=1,…,T,it is also cheaper to hold unit at the warehouse rather than backlogging it at retailer i in period t. In other words, the backlogging cost of any W-retailer is greater than the holding cost at the warehouse. This assumption matches many practical situations, since backlogging units is often more expensive than holding them in the stock, which is in turn more expensive than holding them in the central warehouse in the case of W-retailers.We now introduce a more general cost structure, called carrying cost structure, that encapsulate both holding and backlogging costs in a single notation. These parameters extend the shelf age dependent holding costs introduced in (Levi et al., 2008) and (Stauffer et al., 2011), which generalize the classical level-dependent holding costs usually considered in the literature (see (Federgruen & Wang, 2013) for further discussion on these cost structures). Namely, a unit ordered in period r at the warehouse and in period s ≥ r at retailer i (we denote by ⌈r, s⌋ such a pair of orders) to satisfy a unit of demanddtiincurs a per-unit carrying cost ofϕrsit. That is,ϕrsitencapsulates the cost for holding one unit at the warehouse from r to s, then either holding it at retailer i from period s to t (if s ≤ t) to serve demand in period t, or backlogging one unit of demand (i, t) from period t to s (if s > t). Note that this cost structure can capture additional phenomena than the traditional linear holding/backlogging costs. For instance, it allows us to consider situations in which the holding cost incurred for a specific item at the central warehouse depends on which retailers it replenishes. It can also capture additional phenomena such as perishability, with a prohibitive holding cost if the period of storage in a location is longer than a certain threshold.Clearly, linear cost parameters are a special case of carrying cost parameters: Indeed, for each demand point (i, t), each ordering period r of the warehouse and each ordering period s ≥ r of retailer i, one can define the total carrying cost incurred to serve demand (i, t) with the pair of orders ⌈r, s⌋ as follows:(3)ϕrsit={(∑u=rs−1hu0+∑v=st−1hvi)dtiifs≤t(∑u=rs−1hu0+∑v=ts−1bvi)dtiotherwiseAs already mentioned, the carrying cost parameters do not need to satisfy Eq. (3) for us to derive constant approximations for the backlogging model we consider. In fact, we simply assume that parametersϕrsitsatisfy the following five properties:(P1)Non-negativity. The parametersϕrsitare nonnegative.(P2)Piecewise monotonicity with respect to s. Every retailer i is in exactly one of the two following situations: Eitherϕrsitis non-increasing in s ∈ [r, t] and non-decreasing in s ∈ [t, T] for each demand point (i, t) and warehouse order r, orϕrsitis non-decreasing in s ∈ [r, T] for each demand point (i, t) and warehouse order r. This property defines a partition of the set of retailers into two subsets: IWand IJ, respectively.(P3)Monotonicity with respect to r. For each retaileri=1,…,N,each demand point (i, t) and retailer order in period 1 ≤ s ≤ T,ϕrsitis non-increasing in r ∈ [1, s]. Moreover if i ∈ IJ, we have:ϕrrit≥ϕr′r′itfor r ≤ r′ ≤ t andϕrrit≤ϕr′r′itfor t ≤ r ≤ r′.(P4)Triangle inequality. For each demand point (i, t) with i ∈ IW, we haveϕrsit≤{ϕrtit+ϕssitifr≤s≤tϕrtit+ϕtsitifr≤t<sϕrrit+ϕtsitotherwise(P5)Backlogging cost bounding. If i ∈ IW, for each demand point (i, t) and retailer i order in period s > t, we haveϕtsit≤2ϕssitIn the remainder of the paper, we refer to the metric carrying cost structure when the parameters satisfy the five properties introduced above. It is straightforward to check that properties (P1), (P3) and (P4) capture the linear per-unit holding/penalty cost structure. Moreover if the set of retailers is partitioned into two subsets IWand IJas defined by (1) and (2), properties (P2) and (P5) are also satisfied and therefore the linear holding/penalty cost structure is a particular case of the metric carrying cost structure. Notice that property (P5) generalizes the inequalitybti≥ht0for all t and i ∈ IWto the case of carrying cost parameters. As already discussed, these assumptions cover many other practical cases.In the remainder of this paper, we call a solution π to our problem a policy. Any policy π for the problem is represented by a (N+1)-upletπ=(π0,π1,⋯,πN)where each πiis the set of pairs (ordering period, quantity) for location i. A policy π is feasible for the OWMR problem if the two following conditions are satisfied:Condition 1. For alli=1,…,Npolicy πiorders at least the sum of the demandsdtiover the entire planning horizon.Condition 2. Let r and r′ be two consecutive ordering periods of the warehouse. Then the quantities ordered by π0 in period r are sufficient to serve the orders placed by all the retailers in periodsr,…,r′−1.Given a policy π for the entire system, we denoteC(π)the total cost incurred by π over the planning horizon. This cost can be split into two parts: The total ordering cost denotedK(π)and the total carrying (i.e. holding/backlogging) cost denoted Ψ(π) and thus we have:C(π)=K(π)+Ψ(π)We conclude this section by pointing out three dominant properties on any feasible policy for the problem with the metric carrying cost structure. First, it is easy to prove that there exists an optimal policyπOPT=(π0OPT,π1OPT,…,πNOPT)such that for alli=1,…,N,πiOPTorders only when its inventory level is nonpositive. In addition, the metric carrying cost structure ensures that there exists an optimal policy in which each demanddtiis served from a unique pair of orders ⌈r, s⌋, which is a classical dominant property in most of the inventory models. This allows us to incorporate the amountdtidirectly into the cost parameters by settingψitrs≡ϕrsitdti,whereϕrsitis a per-unit cost satisfying properties (P1)-(P5). Sincedti≥0for all i, t, parametersψrsitalso satisfy properties (P1)-(P5) and correspond to the total carrying cost incurred to serve the entire demanddtifrom the pair of orders ⌈r, s⌋. Therefore in the remainder of the paper we use parametersψrsitto prove our approximation results. Finally, it is clear from property (P2) that there exists an optimal policy in which all J-retailers orders are synchronized with a warehouse order. In particular, we shall assume w.l.o.g. that the optimal policies considered in the following sections satisfy this property.Basically, the algorithm works in two steps: First decompose the original problem into several single-echelon subproblems, then solve each of them and recompose the resulting policies into a feasible policy for the OWMR problem. Each sub-problem is a relaxation of the OWMR problem where we remove the requirement that warehouse and retailer orders are synchronized but both just need to match the demand.The first step of our algorithm is to decompose a general OWMR problem with backlog into several single-echelon subproblems. In addition, we show that by splitting the carrying cost between the different subproblems, we can derive a new lower bound for the original problem.(S^0)The warehouse is regarded as a single-echelon, multi-item system with backlogging facing for each period t a demanddtifor itemi=1,…,N. A fixed ordering costKr0is incurred for placing an order in period r. If a demand (i, t) is ordered in period r ≤ t, it incurs a holding cost of13ψrtitif i ∈ IWand12ψrritif i ∈ IJ. On the other hand if r > t, it incurs a backlogging cost of13ψrritif i ∈ IWand12ψrritif i ∈ IJ.(S^i)Retailer i is considered as a single-echelon system with backlog facing demanddtiwith ordering cost Ki. The carrying cost incurred to order in period s to serve the demand in period t is equal to23ψssitif i ∈ IWand12ψssitif i ∈ IJ.Problem(S^0)and problems(S^i)are all equivalent to single-echelon lot-sizing problems with backlog. However, note that the first one corresponds to the multi-item version of this problem. These problems have been widely studied in the literature and it is well-known that finding their optimal solution can be reduced to finding a shortest path in a graphGj=(Vj,Ej)representing problem(S^j)(see Fig. 1). For allj=0,…,N,Vj={0,…,T+1}is the set of periods, where 0 andT+1are two artificial periods representing the beginning and the end of the planning horizon. Given two consecutive orders u and v and t ∈ [u, v], properties (P2) and (P3) ensure that it is suboptimal to serve demanddtiwith an order placed earlier than u or later than v. As a consequence fori=1,…,Nan arc (u, v) ∈ Eirepresents two consecutive orders in a solution and its length is equal to the minimal possible cost incurred for placing an order in period u and carrying the units necessary to serve demandsdui,…,dv−1iby ordering them either in period u or in period v. Therefore its lengthlu,viis equal to:lu,vi={∑t=1v−123ψvvitifu=0andi∈IW∑t=1v−112ψvvitifu=0andi∈IJKi+∑t=uv−123min{ψuuit,ψvvit}ifu>0andi∈IWKi+∑t=uv−112min{ψuuit,ψvvit}otherwiseThe definition of an arc (u, ), u ≤ v, is similar for the warehouse, except that in this case the system has to serve demands of all the items between two consecutive orders in periods u and v. Its lengthlu,v0is then set to:lu,v0={∑t=1v−1(∑i∈IW13ψvtit+∑i∈IJ12ψvvit)ifu=0Ku0+∑t=uv−1(∑i∈IW13min{ψutit,ψvvit}+∑i∈IJ12min{ψuuit,ψvvit})otherwiseNote that these lengths are computed in time O(T2) for the single-item problem and O(NT2) for the multi-item case. Moreover, from the nonnegativity of parametersψrsit,they are nonnegative and therefore one can easily find a shortest path from node 0 toT+1in graph Gjusing classical shortest path algorithms. Since graph Gjis acyclic and has O(T2) arcs, a topological sorting or breadth-first search algorithm can compute the shortest path in time O(T2). Hence, finding an optimal policy for the single-echelon problems can be achieved in time complexity O(NT2) for(S^0)and O(T2) for each(S^i),i=1,…,N.We denoteπ^ja feasible policy for system(S^j). Note that ifj=0,π^0is a set of(N+1)-uplet (r, qr), wherer∈{1,…,T}and qris the N-uplet of quantities ordered for each item in period r. For all j, we denoteC^j(π^j)the total cost incurred by policyπ^jin system(S^j). In the same fashion as the one used for the global cost, it can be split between two components:C^j(π^j)=Kj(π^j)+Ψ^j(π^j)whereKj(π^j)(resp.Ψ^j(π^j)) denotes the total ordering (resp. carrying) cost incurred by policyπ^jin system(S^j).To conclude this section, we introduce a new lower bound for the optimal solution of the OWMR problem with backlog using the decomposition discussed above. Assume that we compute an optimal policyπ^j*to problem(S^j)for all j. The next lemma uses the costs incurred by these policies in the single-echelon systems(S^j)to define a lower bound on the cost of any policy for the original problem. In particular, the sum of these costs is a lower bound on its optimal cost.Lemma 1Consider a OWMR problem with backlog and a metric carrying cost structure. LetC*be the cost of an optimal policy for this problem and letπ^0*,π^1*,…,π^N*be optimal single-echelon policies for problems(S^0),(S^1),…,(S^N)as defined in the decomposition. Then the following inequality holds:C*≥∑j=0NC^j(π^j*)Proof. The proof of this lemma is detailed in Appendix A. Basically, we start from an optimal policyπOPT=(π0OPT,π1OPT,…,πNOPT)and decompose it inN+1single-echelon policiesπ¯0,π¯1,…,π¯N,one for each system(S^j). We then show that the sum of the costs incurred by policiesπ¯jin systems(S^j)is lower than the optimal costC*for the original problem. The proof then follows from the optimality of policiesπ^j*.□In this section, we modify the uncrossing method and use the decomposition(S^0),(S^1),…,(S^N)to build a feasible solution for the original problem. In addition we prove that when the solution is built upon the optimal single-echelon policies for these independent systems, the policy obtained has a cost of at most three times the optimal cost.Letπ^0,…,π^Nbe feasible policies for problems(S^0),…,(S^N). Recall that in our model, the warehouse cannot backlog the orders of the retailers. Thus in order to build a feasible policy to the original problem from policiesπ^i,we need to eliminate the problematic situations where policyπ^iorders a demanddtiin period s whileπ^0orders the same demand in period r > s. We say that the pair of orders ⌈r, s⌋ is crossing (or not feasible) if r > s.We now present the uncrossing algorithm for the OWMR problem with backlog. LetR={r1,⋯,rw}denote the set of periods when the warehouse orders according to policyπ^0. For convenience we add to R an artificial periodrw+1=T+1corresponding to the end of the planning horizon, with no ordering cost. Given a set R – induced by a policy π0 – and a periods=1,…,T,lets+ands−be the first period of R after s and the last period of R prior to s, respectively:(4)s+=min{r∈R:r≥s}(5)s−=max{r∈R:r≤s}In what follows, the set R used to defines+ands−will be clear from the context.For simplicity, we say that a retailer order in period s is crossing in period r if there exists a demanddtiserved byπ^iin period s and byπ^0in period r, with r > s. As its name suggests, the following algorithm uncrosses such retailer orders by simply adding an order of retailer i in periods+in order to synchronize with the warehouse. Note that in the case of J-retailers, we also synchronize the orders when r ≤ s by placing an additional order in periods−,which enables us to bound the holding cost incurred in the resulting policy.The uncrossing algorithmInput: A set of feasible policiesπ^ifor each problem(S^i),i=0,…,N.Output: A feasible policy πufor the OWMR problem with backlog, defined as follows. Let r and s be the periods whenπ^0andπ^iorder to serve demanddti,respectively. The final policy πuthen uses the pair of orders ⌈rit, sit⌋ to serve demanddti,where(6)⌈rit,sit⌋={⌈s+,s+⌋ifr>s⌈s−,s−⌋ifi∈IJandr≤s⌈s−,s⌋ifi∈IWandr≤sNote that this operation is executed in time O(NT), which leads to a final complexity (including the resolution of the single-echelon subproblems) of O(NT2).We now focus on the total cost incurred by πu, the final policy built by the uncrossing algorithm. The following lemma bounds the overcost incurred by the uncrossing algorithm compared to the costs of the independent single-echelon policiesπ^j.Lemma 2The uncrossing algorithm applied to single-echelon policiesπ^0,…,π^Nproduces an uncrossed feasible solution πufor the OWMR problem. The total cost incurred by the resulting policy satisfies:C(πu)≤3∑i=0NΨ^i(π^i)+K0(π^0)+2∑i=1NKi(π^i)Moreover in the special case of the JRP (i.e. ifIW=∅), we have:C(πu)≤2∑i=0NΨ^i(π^i)+K0(π^0)+2∑i=1NKi(π^i)Proof. See Appendix B.□We now show that when the split and uncross algorithm builds a policy πuupon optimal policiesπ^0*,π^1*,…,π^N*for single-echelon systems(S^0),(S^1),…,(S^N),C(πu)is at most three times the optimal costC*. More precisely, the 3-approximation algorithm works as follows:Step 1 Compute optimal policiesπ^0*,π^1*,…,π^N*for problems(S^0),(S^1),…,(S^N)independently.Step 2 Apply the uncrossing algorithm to policiesπ^0*,…,π^N*.Let πu* be the resulting policy: From Lemmas 1 and 2, we have:C(πu*)≤3∑i=0NΨ^i(π^i*)+K0(π^0*)+2∑i=1NKi(π^i*)≤3∑i=0NC^i(π^i*)≤3C*We conclude that the following theorem holds:Theorem 1The policy πu*obtained after applying the split and uncross algorithm to policiesπ^0*,π^1*,…,π^N*has a performance guarantee of three for the OWMR problem with backlog. Its complexity is quadratic in the case of a metric carrying cost structure.Notice that in the special case of the JRP, property (P5) becomes irrelevant sinceIW=∅. In addition, the above inequality can be refined to reach a performance guarantee of two:C(πu*)≤2∑i=0NΨ^i(π^i*)+K0(π^0*)+2∑i=1NKi(π^i*)≤2∑i=0NC^i(π^i*)≤2C*Theorem 2The policy πu*obtained after applying the split and uncross algorithm to policiesπ^0*,π^1*,…,π^N*has a performance guarantee of two for the JRP with backlog.While in the backorder model we assume that customers are willing to wait for their demands to be fulfilled, another alternative is to consider a model in which customers are impatient and every unmet demand is simply lost. Most of the lost-sales literature focuses on cost structures in which it is dominant to serve demands on a first-come first-served basis. Although this is clearly the case for the linear cost setting, our model uses a general metric cost structure derived from the one introduced in Section 2, in which the latter property is not necessarily dominant.In this section, we introduce a modified decomposition for the problem and exhibits a lower bound for the OWMR problem with lost-sales. We then show how to adapt the split and uncross technique to this problem and build a 2-approximation from the subproblems of the decomposition.We use the general cost structure introduced in Section 2 to modelize the case of lost-sales problem and simply consider it as a special case of the backorder version, where parametersϕrsitare constant when demand ditis not satisfied immediately. We haveϕrsit=ϕitfor all s > t and the following inequality holds for parametersψrsit:(7)ψrsit=ψit=ϕitditforalls>tThus the parameter ψitcorresponds to the total lost-sales cost associated to demand point (i, t). In other words, if the system serves demand ditwith the pair of orders ⌈r, s⌋ where s ≤ t, it incurs a costψrsitwhile if it does not serve this demand, the cost for loosing the sale is equal to ψit. Another way to see the lost-sales penalty cost is to consider that there exists an alternative stock from which we can order units to satisfy an unmet demand, for a total ordering cost of ψit. Note that in our model one can speculate on the penalty cost and deliberately choose to order from this alternative stock if the penalty cost is attractive compared to the cost of serving the demand using the inventory on hand.Constraint (7) ensures that properties (P1)-(P4) are satisfied when s > t. On the other hand, property (P5) is not necessary in the lost-sales case and therefore we only assume that parametersψrsitsatisfy properties (P1)–(P4) and equation (7) in the remainder of this section.In the same fashion as the backorder model, we decompose the system intoN+1independent single-echelon problems with lost-sales. However in this version, the holding costs and lost-sales penalty costs are halved instead of divided by three. Similarly to the JRP case, increasing the fraction of the real costs used in the subproblems is crucial to obtain a performance guarantee of two.The decomposition for the OWMR with lost-sales is defined as follows:(S˜0)The warehouse is regarded as a single-echelon, multi-item system with lost-sales, facing for each period t a demand ditfor item i. A fixed ordering costKr0is incurred for placing an order in period r. The holding cost incurred if demand (i, t) is ordered in period r is equal to12ψrritif i ∈ IJand12ψrtitif i ∈ IW. If the demand is lost, the system incurs a lost-sales cost equal to12ψit.(S˜i)Retailer i is considered as a single-echelon system with lost-sales, facing demand ditwith ordering cost Ki. The holding cost incurred to order to serve demand (i, t) with an order in period s is equal to12ψssit,while the per-unit cost if the demand is lost is equal to12ψit.Similarly to the previous sections, we defineC˜i(π˜i)(resp.Ψ˜i(π˜i)) as the total (resp. carrying) cost incurred byπ˜iin system(S˜i)and we have for alli=0,…,N:C˜i(π˜i)=Ki(π˜i)+Ψ˜i(π˜i)We first discuss how to solve these single-echelon problems. Similarly to the systems with backlog, this can be done using classical shortest path algorithms in the same type of graph (see Fig. 1). We define a graph Gjcorresponding to each single-echelon problem(S˜j). The main difference comes from the computation of the length of each arc (u, v), u < v, that we detail below.We first introduce the following virtual cost parameters:(8)ω˜rit={min{ψrrit,ψit}ifi∈IJmin{ψrtit,ψit}otherwise(9)ρ˜sit=min{ψssit,ψit}These are the virtual minimum cost between satisfying or loosing demand ditwhen the last order is placed in period r or s. One can precompute these parameters in time O(T2) for one retailer and O(NT2) for the warehouse. We then define the length of each edge (u, v) in graphs Giand G0 as follows:∀i=1,…,N,l˜u,vi={∑t=1v−112ψitifu=0Ki+∑t=uv−112ρ˜uitotherwisel˜u,v0={∑i=1N∑t=1v−112ψitifu=0Ku0+∑i=1N∑t=uv−112ω˜uitotherwiseThese lengths are computed in time O(NT2). As for the backorder version, the time complexity to compute theN+1optimal policies to problems(S˜j)is equal to O(NT2).We now focus on the lower bound resulting from this decomposition. The following lemma derives from Lemma 1:Lemma 3Consider a OWMR problem with lost-sales. LetC*be the cost of an optimal policy for this problem and letπ˜0*,π˜1*,…,π˜N*be optimal single-echelon policies for problems(S˜0),(S˜1),…,(S˜N)as defined in the decomposition. Then the following inequality holds:C*≥∑i=0NC˜i(π˜i*)Proof The proof is similar to the one of Lemma 1 (see Appendix C).□To conclude this section, we show how to adapt the split and uncross technique to the lost-sales case and build a 2-approximation algorithm. Letπ˜0,…,π˜Nbe feasible policies for problems(S˜0),…,(S˜N)and letR={r1,⋯,rw,rw+1}the set of periods when policyπ˜0places order, where againrw+1=T+1is an artificial period corresponding to the end of the planning horizon. The algorithm is very similar to the one presented in Section 3.2, with the following simple modification. Leti=1,…,Nandt=1,…,T: If neitherπ˜0norπ˜isatisfiesdti,then the demand is lost in the final policy πu. Otherwise the ordering periods for demanddtiat the warehouse and at the retailer are defined according to Eq. (6).It is straightforward that the lower bound from Lemma 2 holds in this special case of the problem. However, since we only halve the holding and penalty costs in the subproblems instead of dividing them by three, we can improve upon this result to get the following lower bound:Lemma 4The uncrossing algorithm applied to single-echelon policiesπ˜0,…,π˜Nproduces an uncrossed feasible solutionπ˜ufor the OWMR problem with lost-sales. The total cost incurred by the resulting policy satisfies:C(π˜u)≤K0(π˜0)+2Ψ˜0(π˜0)+2∑i=1NC˜i(π˜i)Proof See Appendix D.□Finally, assume the solution built by the split and uncross algorithm when applied to the optimal single-echelon policisπ˜0*,π˜1*,…,π˜N*for problems(S˜0),(S˜1),…,(S˜N). Letπ˜u*be the resulting policy: From Lemmas 3 and 4, we have:C(π˜u*)≤K0(π˜0*)+2Ψ˜0(π˜0*)+2∑i=1NC˜i(π˜i*)≤2∑i=0NC˜i(π˜i*)≤2C*and the following theorem states the approximation ratio of the technique:Theorem 3The policyπ˜u*obtained after applying the split and uncross algorithm to policiesπ˜0*,π˜1*,…,π˜N*has a performance guarantee of two for the OWMR problem with lost-sales. Its complexity is linear in the case of linear cost and quadratic in the case of metric carrying cost parameters.Although the literature on discrete deterministic divergent inventory systems is already substantial, almost all the existing works assume that demands must be satisfied on time. Our work propose the first constant approximation for the OWMR problem with backlog or lost-sales. We derive new, intuitive lower bounds for the problems considered and prove that our algorithms have a constant performance guarantee under a general cost structure that can capture many practical situations. In addition we show that the performance guarantee can be improved in special cases of our model, namely the JRP and a lost-sales model.Although these results fill a gap in the literature on deterministic inventory theory, there remains some room for improvement. One obvious way for future research is to try to improve the performance guarantee of three in the backlogging case. One could also want to generalize the assumptions on the cost structure by eliminating the backlogging cost bounding constraint or considering nonlinear carrying costs.Consider an optimal policyπOPT=(π0OPT,π1OPT,…,πNOPT)for the OWMR system with backlog. For allj=0,…,N,letπ¯jbe the single-echelon policy that places the same orders asπjOPT. That is, if πOPT orders demand (i, t) in period r at the warehouse and s at retailer i,π¯0andπ¯iorders demand (i, t) in period r and s, respectively.Note that by definition ofπ¯jfor all j, the ordering costs remain untouched:K(πOPT)=∑j=0NKj(π¯j). Therefore we simply have to prove that∑j=0NΨj(π¯j)≤Ψ(πOPT)and the proof will follow from the optimality of policiesπ^0*,π^1*,…,π^N*. Consider a demand point (i, t) and let r and s be the periods when πOPT orders the demand at the warehouse and at retailer i, respectively. The carrying cost incurred by πOPT for this demand is therefore equal toψrsit. On the other hand, the total cost incurred by policiesπ¯0andπ¯ito carry this demand in systems(S^0)(resp.(S^i)) is equal to13ωrrit(resp.23ψssit) if i ∈ IWand12ωrrit(resp.12ψssit) if i ∈ IJ. Hence we want to show thatψrsitis bounded as follows:(A.1)ψrsit≥{13ψrrit+23ψssitifi∈IW12ψrrit+12ψssitotherwise.which is precisely the sum of the costs incurred by policiesπ¯0andπ¯jto carry demanddti. We now prove that inequality (A.1) holds depending on the nature of retailer i.If i ∈ IJ, we haver=ssince πOPT is optimal and therefore(A.2)ψrsit=ψrrit=ψssit(A.3)=12ψrrit+12ψssitIf i ∈ IW, we distinguish between two cases, listed below:•s ≤ t or r > t: Properties (P2) and (P3) ensure that(A.4)ψrsit≥max{ψrtit,ψssit}≥13ψrrit+23ψssitr ≤ t < s: We have from properties (P2) and (P3)(A.5)ψrsit≥max{ψrtit,ψtsit}≥13ψrrit+23ψtsit≥13ψrrit+23ψssitHence in all cases, inequality (A.1) is satisfied and we haveΨ(πOPT)≥∑j=0NΨj(π¯j). As a consequence the following inequality holds:(A.6)C*=C(πOPT)≥∑j=0NCj(π¯j)Inequality (A.6) and the optimality of policiesπ^j*for problems(S^j)then conclude the proof:∑j=0NCj(π^j*)≤∑j=0NC(π¯j)≤C*First, note that for alli=1,…,Nandt=1,…,T,the pair of orders ⌈rit, sit⌋ chosen by the algorithm to servedtisatisfies rit≤ sitand therefore policy πuis uncrossed and feasible.We now prove that the final cost incurred by πuis bounded. By construction, each ordering period ofπ^iis replaced by at most two ordering periods at retailer i in πu. More precisely, the set of ordering periods of retailer i in πuis included in{s−,s+|sanorderingperiodofπ^i}if i ∈ IJ, and in{s,s+|sanorderingperiodofπ^i}if i ∈ IW. Thus the number of ordering periods at each retailer is at most doubled by the uncrossing algorithm. Moreover the uncrossing algorithm leaves the orders ofπ^0untouched, hence using the assumption of stationary ordering costs Kiat the retailers, we have that the ordering costs incurred by πuare at most twice the sum of the ordering costs incurred by policiesπ^i.Therefore if IW≠ ∅ it only remains to prove that the following inequalities hold:(B.1)Ψ(πu)≤3∑j=0NΨ^j(π^j)Leti=1…,Nandt=1,…,Tand focus on demand point (i, t). Let r be the period whenπ^0ordersdtiand s the period whenπ^iordersdtiin their single-echelon solution. We now bound the final carrying cost incurred in πuto servedti. Recall that in πu,dtiis served by the pair ⌈rit, sit⌋, as defined in Eq. (6). Hence we want to show that for a retailer i and periods t, r, s, the following inequality is satisfied:ψrit,sitit≤{3·13ψrtit+3·23ψssit=ψrtit+2ψssitifi∈IWandr≤t(B.2)3·13ψrrit+3·23ψssit=ψrrit+2ψssitifi∈IWandr>t(B.3)2·12ψrrit+2·12ψssit=ψrrit+ψssitifi∈IJ(B.4)If i ∈ IJ, the order of retailer i that servesdtiin policy πuis synchronized with a warehouse order either in periods−ors+. Note that by definition we necessarily haver≤s−if r ≤ s andr≥s+if r > s. Hence if r ≤ s, we have from property (P4)ψs−s−it≤ψrrit≤ψrrit+ψssitOn the other hand if r > s,  πuuses the pair⌈s+,s+⌋to servedtiand from property (P2) and (P3) the following inequality holdsψs+s+it≤{ψrritifr>tψssitotherwise≤max{ψrrit,ψssit}≤ψrrit+ψssitHence if i ∈ IJinequality  (B.4) is satisfied for all t, r, s.In the case where i is a W-retailer, we again derive a lower bound for the carrying cost depending on how r,  s and t are ordered. If r ≤ s and r ≤ t, the final cost incurred in πuto servedtiisψs−sit. Notice that in this case, we haver≤s−. Therefore we can bound the carrying cost incurred to serve demanddtiusing properties (P3), (P4) and (P5) in their turn:ψs−sit≤{ψs−tit+ψssitifr≤s≤tψs−tit+ψtsitifr≤t<s≤{ψrtit+ψssitifr≤s≤tψrtit+ψtsitifr≤t<s≤ψrtit+2ψssitOn the other hand if t < r ≤ s, properties (P3) and (P5) ensure thatψs−sit≤ψtsit≤2ψssit≤ψrrit+2ψssitFinally if r > s, we use properties (P2) and (P3) to bound the final carrying cost:ψs+s+it≤{ψrritift<s+ψssitotherwise≤max{ψrrit,ψssit}≤ψrrit+ψssitWe conclude that if i ∈ IWinequalities (B.2) and (B.3) are satisfied.Therefore if πuuses the pair of orders ⌈rit, sit⌋, inequalities (B.2), (B.3) and (B.4) are always satisfied. As a consequence inequality (D.1) holds and the proof follows:C(πu)≤3∑j=0NΨ^j(π^j)+K0(π^0)+2∑i=1NKi(π^i)To conclude the proof, notice that whenIW=∅,inequality  (B.3) implies thatΨ(πu)≤2∑j=0NΨ^j(π^j)and thus one can modify the upper bound in the special case of the JRP:C(πu)≤2∑j=0NΨ^j(π^j)+K0(π^0)+2∑i=1NKi(π^i)We prove this inequality in a similar manner as we did for Lemma 1. Consider an optimal policyπOPT=(π0OPT,π1OPT,…,πNOPT)for the OWMR system with lost-sales. For allj=0,…,N,we defineπ¯jas the policy that orders in the same periods asπjOPTand fills or looses demands exactly as the latter does. Obviously, we again haveK(πOPT)=∑j=0NKj(π¯j). We now prove that∑j=0NΨj(π¯j)≤Ψ(πOPT). Consider a retailer i and a demand point (i, t). Ifdtiis lost in πOPT, then by construction it is lost inπ¯0andπ¯iand we directly have:(C.1)ψit=12ψit+12ψitNow assume the demand is filled and let r and s be the periods when πOPT ordersdtiat the warehouse and at the retailer, respectively. The holding cost incurred by πOPT fordtiis equal toψrsit. If i is a J-retailer, we haver=sand therefore(C.2)ψrsit=ψrrit=ψssit=12ψrrit+12ψssitOn the other hand if i is a W-retailer, we can bound this cost using properties (P2) and (P3):(C.3)ψrsit≥max{ψrtit,ψssit}≥12ψrtit+12ψssitIn both cases, the sum of the holding costs incurred byπ¯0andπ¯ito serve demand (i, t) in systems(S˜0)and(S˜i)is lower than or equal to the cost incurred in πOPT to serve the same demand. Therefore from equations (C.1), (C.2) and (C.3) we concludeΨ(πOPT)≥∑j=0NΨj(π¯j). The optimality of policiesπ˜j*for problems(S˜j)then yields:∑j=0NCj(π˜j*)≤∑j=0NC(π¯j)=∑j=0NKj(π¯j)+Ψj(π¯j)≤K(πOPT)+Ψ(πOPT)≤C*To prove the feasibility of the resulting policy, we refer the reader to the proof of Lemma 2. Similarly, it is straightforward to see thatK(π˜u)≤K0(π˜0)+2∑i=1NKi(π˜i),since for every order inπ˜ithe algorithm places at most two orders in the final policyπ˜u. Therefore we only have to prove that(D.1)Ψ(π˜u)≤2∑j=0NΨj(π˜j)Leti=1…,Nandt=1,…,Tand focus on demand point (i, t). If thedtiis lost inπ˜0orπ˜i,it incurs a cost of at least12ψitin these policies. Since by construction it is also lost inπ˜u,it incurs a cost of exactly ψitin the final solution. Now assume the demand is filled both inπ˜0andπ˜iand let r and s be the respective ordering periods of these policies for this demand. We want to prove that the final holding cost incurred inπ˜uto servedtiis at most the sum of the holding cost it incurs in policiesπ˜0andπ˜i.This final cost depends on the path followed by the units in the system after applying the uncrossing policy. Specifically, we want to compare this cost with the cost of the paths the same units follow in the single echelon policiesπ˜0andπ˜i. We distinguish several cases depending on the type of retailer and on the respective position of r and s (see also Fig. D.2for a specific example of units path in each case):•If i ∈ IJand r ≤ s,π˜uordersdtiin periods−at the warehouse and at the retailer for a final cost ofψs−s−it. The holding cost incurred by policyπ˜0(resp.π˜i) to serve this demand is equal toψrrit(resp.ψssit). Sinces−≥r,we have from property (P3):(D.2)ψs−s−it≤ψrrit≤ψrrit+ψssitIf i ∈ IJand r > s,π˜uorders the demand in periods+at the warehouse and at the retailer for a final cost ofψs+s+it. The holding cost incurred by policyπ˜0(resp.π˜i) to serve this demand is equal toψrrit(resp.ψssit). Sinces+≥s,we have from property (P3):(D.3)ψs+s+it≤ψssit≤ψrrit+ψssitIf i ∈ IWand r ≤ s,π˜uorders the demand in periods−at the warehouse and in period s at the retailer for a final cost ofψs−sit. Recall that by definition, we haver≤s−. The holding cost incurred by policyπ˜0(resp.π˜i) to serve this demand is equal toψrtit(resp.ψssit). Thus we have from property (P3) and (P4):(D.4)ψs−sit≤ψrsit≤ψrtit+ψssitIf i ∈ IWand s < r,π˜uorders the demand in periods+at the warehouse and at the retailer for a final cost ofψs+s+it. The holding cost incurred by policyπ˜0(resp.π˜i) to serve this demand is equal toψrtit(resp.ψssit). Sinces+>swe have from property (P3):(D.5)ψs+s+it≤ψssit≤ψrtit+ψssitNote that in inequalities (D.2)–(D.5), the right-hand side corresponds exactly to twice the sum of the holding cost incurred in policyπ˜0andπ˜ito serve demanddti. As a consequence in all cases the holding or penalty cost incurred to serve or loose this demand inπ˜uis at most twice the sum of the costs incurred for the same demand in policiesπ˜0andπ˜i. We conclude that inequality (D.1) holds and the proof follows.
