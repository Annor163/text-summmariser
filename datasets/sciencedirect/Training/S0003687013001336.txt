FMS™ scores and low-back loading during lifting – Whole-body movement screening as an ergonomic tool?

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Firefighters performed simulated occupational lifting tasks in a laboratory setting.Low-back loading was compared between firefighters who scored above and below 14 on FMS.No differences detected in peak low-back loading magnitudes between low- and high-scorers.Lumbar spines of low-scorers tended to be more flexed when peak loads were applied.The “margin of safety” may be lower in firefighters who score below 14 on the FMS.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundPrevious research suggests that a general whole-body movement screen could be used to identify personal movement attributes that promote potentially injurious low-back loading patterns at work. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS) composite scores and the low-back loading response to lifting.MethodsFifteen men who scored greater than 14 on the FMS (high-scorers) and 15 height- and weight-matched low-scorers (FMS < 14) performed sagittally symmetric and asymmetric laboratory-based lifting tasks. A three-dimensional dynamic biomechanical model was used to calculate peak low-back loading levels, and the angle of the lumbar spine was captured at the instant when the peak compressive force was applied.ResultsRegardless of the lifting task performed, there were no differences in peak low-back compression (p ≥ 0.4157), anterior/posterior reaction shear (p ≥ 0.5645), or medial/lateral reaction shear (p ≥ 0.2581) forces between the high- and low-scorers. At the instant when peak compressive forces were applied, differences in the lumbar spine angle between high- and low-scores were not statistically significant about the lateral bend (p ≥ 0.4215), axial twist (p ≥ 0.2734), or flexion/extension (p ≥ 0.1354) axes, but there was a tendency for the lumbar spine to be more deviated in the low-scorers.ConclusionsUsing the previously established injury prediction threshold value of 14, the composite FMS score was not related to the peak low-back loading magnitudes in lifting. Though not statistically significant, the tendency for the lumbar spines of low-scorers to be more deviated when the peak low-back compression force was imposed could be biomechanically meaningful because spinal load tolerance varies with posture. Future attempts to modify or reinterpret FMS scoring are warranted given that several previous studies have revealed links between composite FMS scores and musculoskeletal complaints.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Previous work has shown that distal lower extremity joint dysfunction can influence peak low-back loading during lifting (Beach et al., 2013). Despite being a logical response to the elimination of biomechanical degrees-of-freedom in a closed kinetic chain task, this finding provides empirical support for the notion that a general whole-body movement screen could expose personal movement qualities that promote potentially injurious low-back loading patterns at work. When the body is viewed as a “movement system”, such qualities may represent inherent structural or functional attributes that effectively limit the movement strategies available and thus influence how individuals consciously or subconsciously interact with their environment when engaged in physical activity (Davids et al., 2003). It is therefore conceivable that a tool devised to appraise whole-body movements could be used to project the low-back loading response to lifting.The Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS) is a popular tool proposed to reveal a host of undesirable personal movement attributes (e.g., joint mobility restrictions, bilateral asymmetries, postural control deficits, and pain-producing movement patterns) (Cook et al., 2006a, b; Cook et al., 2010). Using standardized verbal instructions, testing apparatus, and grading criteria, the ability to move freely, symmetrically, and without pain is appraised via visual inspection of whole-body movement behavior during FMS task performance. Patterns of movement coordination and control that differ overtly from those deemed normal or desirable are purported to indicate the presence of undesirable personal attributes that could, if left unchecked, promote potentially injurious movement patterns in life.Although FMS scores have not been consistently linked with musculoskeletal injury reporting (Schneiders et al., 2011), there may be benefit in including the FMS as part of a comprehensive injury prevention and management program for firefighters (Butler et al., 2013; Peate et al., 2007). Peate et al. (2007) found that full duty firefighters with a musculoskeletal injury history were 1.68 times more likely to “fail” the FMS than were firefighters without an injury history; “failing” was operationally defined as achieving a composite FMS score of 16 or less (out of 21). This value is higher than the statistically derived cut-point (FMS ≤ 14) reported originally based on data from a professional American football team (Kiesel et al., 2007). In support of the statistically-derived cut-point, Butler et al. (2013) found that the probability of missing training time (due to musculoskeletal pain) was greater in firefighter recruits with FMS < 14 than in those with FMS ≥ 14. Scoring 14 or less on the FMS has also been linked with pain and injuries in collegiate athletes (Chorba et al., 2010) and military service personnel (Lisman et al., 2013; O'Connor et al., 2011). Given that personal movement constraints can influence joint loading throughout the kinetic chain (Beach et al., 2013), a tool such as the FMS may help to identify firefighters who are at greater risk of (re-)injuring their low-backs when lifting, a common and costly problem in the fire service (Walton et al., 2003).This study was designed to compare the low-back loading response to lifting between two groups of height- and weight-matched career firefighters. Firefighters who scored greater than 14 on the FMS were allocated to the first group, and size-matched counterparts who scored less than 14 were assigned to the second group. Based on the reasoning outlined above, it was hypothesized that the peak low-back loading response would differ between the high- and low-scorers. In an exploratory analysis performed a posteriori, the data were re-analyzed to examine if performance on individual FMS tasks was related to low-back loading during lifting. It was hypothesized that, with respect to the study purpose, performance on individual tasks may be better suited to reveal undesirable movement attributes than would others.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Using a previously established injury prediction threshold value of 14, the composite FMS score was unrelated to peak low-back loading magnitudes during lifting. However, there was a tendency for the lumbar spines of low-scorers (FMS < 14) to be more deviated when the peak low-back compressive force was applied, possibly reducing their “margin of safety” in comparison to high-scorers (FMS > 14). Future attempts to modify or reinterpret FMS scoring are justified given that several previous studies have revealed links between composite FMS scores and musculoskeletal complaints.
