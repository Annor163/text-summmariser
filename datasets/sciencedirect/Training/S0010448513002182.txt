@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We propose a variational-difference method for designing the optical free form surface of progressive-addition lenses (PALs). The PAL, which has a front surface with three important zones including the far-view, near-view and intermediate zones, is often used to remedy presbyopia by distributing optical powers of the three zones progressively and smoothly. The problem for designing PALs could be viewed as a functional minimization problem. Compared with the existing literature which solved the problem by the B-spline finite element method, the essence of the proposed variational-difference numerical method lies in minimizing the functional directly by finite difference method and/or numerical quadratures rather than in approximating the solution of the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation to the functional. It is very easily understood and implemented by optical engineers, and the numerical results indicate that it can produce satisfactory designs for optical engineers in several seconds. We believe that our method can be a powerful candidate tool for designing various specifications of PALs.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
When we reach about forty years old, the natural process of aging begins to affect our vision, and the lens of our eyes thickens and progressively loses its flexibility to the point where we have trouble focusing on near points. This causes presbyopia. Therefore, it is natural that people with presbyopia need their vision to be corrected by wearing spectacle lenses. People can often use single-vision lenses to correct this problem. However, although these can enable very good vision for nearby regions, people need to take them off in order to have good vision for distance regions. To avoid this inconvenience, more complicated lenses such as the bifocal lens, trifocal lens and progressive-addition lens (PAL) have been designed.Bifocal lenses, which were first invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1784 because he suffered from poor vision at that time, can be divided into two parts, the top half for viewing at distance and the bottom half for reading; trifocal lenses are made up of three parts, with the addition of a part for viewing at intermediate region. A major drawback for these two kinds of lenses is the vision jump when the eyes move from seeing far-distance to near-distance objects. PALs, also known as no-line bifocal lenses, can remove the vision jump drawback. Fig. 1shows a schematic illustration of PALs. As shown in Fig. 1(a), a PAL has a front surface with three different view zones, including distance-view (i.e. far-view), near-view and intermediate zones. More precisely, a PAL has a large far-vision area with low refractive optical power in the upper part and a small near-vision area with high refractive optical power in the lower part, while an intermediate vision area where the optical power varies progressively and smoothly is used to connect with the upper and lower parts of the PAL. Fig. 1(b) shows a typical distribution of refractive optical power on the three different view zones of a PAL along the meridian line. In general, a good PAL design requires that the optical power on the far-view, near-view and intermediate zones be progressively and smoothly changed according to every patient’s prescription, and that the astigmatism on the three zones be as small as possible simultaneously. However, the remaining parts, which are called as blending zones shown in Fig. 1(a), also inevitably have astigmatism because of the prescribed power distribution along the three zones. Although the blending zones are the least frequently used by spectacle wearers, the astigmatism will bring them a bad visual feeling and make them uncomfortable. Therefore, a good PAL design also needs to require that the blending zones have relatively low astigmatism.As early as 1907, British optometrist Owen Aves made a prototype design for PALs  [1,2]. His design idea came from the shape of elephant’s trunk, which consisted of a conical back surface and a cylindrical front with opposing axes in order to create a power progression. This design was the prototype of modern PALs, but it was not commercialized at that time. Since the invention of the first modern design and entry into the marketplace around the 1960s, PALs have been gradually accepted by worldwide customers due to their ability to eliminate the vision jump line between the far-view and near-view portions of the lens and offer spectacle wearers a smooth transition between different vision zones. Nowadays, PALs have gained worldwide acceptance as the high-performance spectacle lenses used in the correction of presbyopia and currently account for more than half of all multi-focal lens sales. Although early progressive lens designs have had great success in providing presbyopic patients with more comfortable vision, lens designers seem to be approaching a limiting state  [3]. Because the visual requirements of spectacle lens wearers vary greatly from person to person, it has been understood for some time that the traditional “one-size-fits-all” progressive lens design framework is no longer suitable for every progressive lens wearer. Therefore, designers need to tailor more suitable and specialized spectacle lenses by considering the unique visual requirements of the individual progressive lens wearer. Thus, the advances in design methods are becoming ever more significant for designing the next generation PALs.Designing PALs is often regarded as a very complicated mathematical problem  [4–10]. In general, the design methods can be divided into two categories, direct methods and indirect methods. In a direct method, such as the research work of Winthrop [4,5] and Baudart, Ahsbahs and Miege  [6], the refractive optical power is first assigned along a line called the meridian line (shown in Fig. 1) on the lens, then the surface on the lens is generated from the meridian line by prescribing curves which are transverse to it. The shapes of these curves are chosen to have the desired surface curvature on the meridian line. However, the performance of such design methods is often less than satisfactory because there is no effective control over the distribution of the astigmatism. For the indirect method, such as the method proposed by Loos et al.  [7,8], the lens design can be simplified as an optimization problem or a functional minimization problem. In such a method, a cost function (functional), which attempts to balance between reaching the desired distribution of refractive optical power and the unwanted astigmatism, will be devised and beforehand given. The design objective is to minimize the cost function (functional) by numerical methods. The indirect method is often more effective and powerful, and it can be quickly implemented by powerful computer simulations. It can also provide more precise control for the distribution of the optical power and astigmatism on the lens surface. Therefore, it represents a powerful candidate tool for designing the customized PALs.In this paper, we focus on the indirect methods for designing PALs. Based on a functional minimization mathematical model, we propose an efficient variational-difference numerical method for solving the problem. Compared with the existing literature which solved the problem by theB-spline finite element method [7,9,10], the essence of the proposed variational-difference numerical method lies in minimizing the functional directly by the finite difference method rather than in approximating the solution of the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation to the functional. It is very easily understood and implemented by optical engineers, and its memory and computational costs are smaller than that of theB-spline finite element method. Our numerical results indicate that it could produce satisfactory design results for optical engineers in several seconds.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly present a mathematical model based on a quadratic functional minimization problem for designing PALs. In Section  3, a variational-difference numerical method is proposed for solving the quadratic functional minimization problem. In Section  4, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the high performances of the proposed numerical method. Finally, Section  5 concludes the paper with a summary and future research plans.For the design of PALs, the optical power is one of the two crucial design parameters for optical engineers according to every patient’s prescription. In general, the optical power of PAL is determined by the shapes of the front and back surfaces, together with the material properties of the lens. In ophthalmic optics, the optical powerPof a lens can be expressed in terms of  [7,9,10](2.1)P=(1−n)Pb+(n−1)Pf1−d(1−1n)Pf,wherePbandPfare the mean curvatures of the back and front surfaces, respectively,dis the thickness of the lens andnrepresents the refractive index of the lens material. Under the assumption that the lens is very thin, we obtain an approximate formula from (2.1) by settingd=0:(2.2)P=(n−1)(Pf−Pb).For the PAL discussed in the paper, the back surface is chosen as a spherical surface with constant mean curvature. Therefore, from the formula (2.2), the progressive change for the optical powerPof a PAL would be achieved by changing the mean curvature of the front surface smoothly and progressively. In this paper, the design objective is to determine the shape of the front surface of the PAL. For brevity, the optical powerPis referred to as the power of the front surface in the remainder of the paper. The optical power is measured in diopter, which is defined as the inverse of focal length (i.e. mean curvature) multiplied by(n−1). Therefore, the diopter is of unit 1/meter.The other crucial design parameter for PALs is called as the (surface) astigmatism or cylinder. Supposeκ1andκ2are the two local principal curvatures of the front surface, then the astigmatism of a lens is defined as(2.3)A=(n−1)|κ1−κ2|,and the unit of astigmatism is also used as diopter. We can see that the two parameters of interest for a PAL design, optical power and astigmatism, are only related to the sum and the difference of the two principal curvatures, respectively. In general, the optical power is needed to provide the appropriate corrections for patients, while the astigmatism is an undesirable effect for a PAL design in the paper. Because if a lens has severe astigmatism, vision distortion will occur and the spectacle wearer will feel uncomfortable, unless the wearer has any astigmatic defect of their eyes.An ideal PAL is one with the prescribed smooth progressive optical power distribution and with the zero astigmatism everywhere on the lens. However, in order to attain zero astigmatism on the whole surface, the surface must be a plane or a sphere, which cannot provide prescribed progressive power. Therefore, the two key design factors, of reaching the desired distribution of optical power and the undesired astigmatism, compete with each other. Following the above observation, Loos et al. proposed a method for determining the shapes of thin progressive lenses, which enables the designers to create a large variety of different designs. Based on their method, to design the surface of PALs, we can minimize the following functional  [7]:(2.4)J(u)=∫Ω[α(x,y)(κ1−κ22)2+β(x,y)(κ1+κ22−P0(x,y))2]dA,whereΩ⊂R2is a bounded domain,u≔u(x,y)defines the shape of the designed lens surface,κ1≔κ1(x,y)andκ2≔κ2(x,y)represent the two principal curvatures of the surface, respectively,dArepresents the area element on the graph ofu(x,y), and the three functionsα≔α(x,y),β≔β(x,y)andP0≔P0(x,y)are previously prescribed functions inΩ. More precisely, the prescribed functionP0is the desired distribution of optical power, and its magnitude increases continuously from the far-view region to the near-view region; the weight functionsαandβcontrol the ratio relation between the occurrence of astigmatism and the derivation from the prescribed power distribution functionP0.Substituting the mean curvatureHand Gauss curvatureKdefined as(2.5)H≔H(x,y)=κ1+κ22,K≔K(x,y)=κ1κ2,(x,y)∈Ω,into the functional (2.4), we can formulate the problem for designing PALs as the following minimization problem:(2.6)(P)MinJ(u)=∫Ω[α(x,y)(H2(x,y)−K(x,y))+β(x,y)(H(x,y)−P0(x,y))2]dA.Suppose that in the Cartesian coordinates the surface of a lens is given by the graph functionz=u(x,y)for(x,y)∈Ω, then the mean curvatureHand Gauss curvatureKcan be given by(2.7)H=(1+ux2)uyy−2uxuyuxy+(1+uy2)uxx2g3,K=uxxuyy−uxy2g4,and the area elementdAcan be expressed by(2.8)dA=gdxdy,withg=1+ux2+uy2,(x,y)∈Ω.Plugging (2.7) and (2.8) into (2.6), we obtain the functional minimization problem for designing a PAL lens.The Euler–Lagrange equation with respect to the functional in (2.6) is a highly nonlinear and high order partial differential equation. Therefore, it is generally very difficult and challenging to solve the problem(P)by direct numerical computation. In the literatures, Wang et al.  [11,9,12] adopted the linearization approximation method for the Euler–Lagrange equation generated from the variational problem(P)to design PALs. By assuming that the designed lens surfaces are a combination of two parts (one is a prescribed spherical background surface and the other is a small perturbation surface with respect to the chosen spherical surface) they simplified the Euler–Lagrange equation with respect to the functional in (2.6) to a linear fourth-order partial differential equation. Under the various boundary conditions including clamped, partially clamped and natural boundary conditions, they showed the existence and uniqueness as well as the regularity of the solutions with respect to the linear fourth-order partial differential equation  [11]. Furthermore, by using theB-spline finite element method, they designed a numerical algorithm for solving the linearized problem  [9].Following the linearization approach proposed by Wang et al.  [11,9] for designing PALs, we assume that the surface functionu(x,y)can be divided into two parts:(2.9)u(x,y)=w(x,y)+v(x,y),(x,y)∈Ω,wherew≔w(x,y)is a chosen background surface andv≔v(x,y)represents the perturbation surface. Therefore, the functional minimization problem(P)with respect tou(x,y)can be converted to the problem with respect to the small perturbation functionv(x,y). Substituting (2.9) into (2.7) and (2.8) and further assuming that the perturbation functionv(x,y)satisfies that|∇v|≈0and|∇2v|is bounded from above in the domainΩ, we can obtain the approximation expressions forH,Kandgas(2.10)H≈Ĥ(v;w)=H(w)+(1+wx2)vyy−2wxwyvxy+(1+wy2)vxx2ĝ3,(x,y)∈Ω,(2.11)K≈K̂(v;w)=(wxx+vxx)(wyy+vyy)−(wxy+vxy)2ĝ4,g≈ĝ=1+wx2+wy2.Inserting (2.10) and (2.11) into (2.6), we obtain the following functional which is an approximation toJ(u)in (2.6):(2.12)I(v;w)=∫Ω[(α+β)Ĥ2−2βP0Ĥ−αK̂+βP02]ĝdxdy.For any given background surfacew(x,y), substituting (2.10) and (2.11) into (2.12), we can easily find that the functionalI(v;w)only depends on the second-order partial derivatives of the perturbation functionv(x,y), i.e. the termsvxx,vxy,vyy, and they are all in quadratic form. It should be noted that, for simplicity, we can drop all the constant terms in expression (2.12) and still denote the functional asI(v;w), then the functionalI(v;w)can be expressed by the following quadratic functional form:(2.13)I(v;w)=∫ΩF(x,y,vxx,vxy,vyy)dxdy,where the integrandF(x,y,vxx,vxy,vyy)is continuous for all the argumentsx,y,vxx,vxy,vyyand can be defined as(2.14)F(x,y,vxx,vxy,vyy)=a1vxx2+a2vxy2+a3vyy2+a4vxxvyy+a5vxyvyy+a6vxxvxy+a7vxx+a8vxy+a9vyy,where the coefficientsaifori=1,2,…,9are given bya1=(1+wy2)24ĝ5(α+β),a2=wx2wy2ĝ5(α+β)+αĝ3,a3=(1+wx2)24ĝ5(α+β),a4=(1+wx2)(1+wy2)2ĝ5(α+β)−αĝ3,a5=−wxwy(1+wx2)ĝ5(α+β),a6=−wxwy(1+wy2)ĝ5(α+β),a7=(1+wy2)H(w)ĝ2(α+β)−wyyĝ3α−1+wy2ĝ2βP0,a8=−2wxwyH(w)ĝ2(α+β)+2wxyĝ3α+2wxwyĝ2βP0,a9=(1+wx2)H(w)ĝ2(α+β)−wxxĝ3α−1+wx2ĝ2βP0,(x,y)∈Ω.In the literature  [11,9,12] and in this paper, for simplicity, the background surface is often chosen as spherical, i.e.(2.15)w(x,y)=R2−x2−y2,(x,y)∈Ω,whereRis a constant to be determined. Under the spherical background surface forw, noticing (2.7), we getH(w)=−1R,wx=−x(R2−x2−y2)1/2,wy=−y(R2−x2−y2)1/2,(x,y)∈Ω,wxx=−R2+y2(R2−x2−y2)3/2,wxy=−xy(R2−x2−y2)3/2,wyy=−R2+x2(R2−x2−y2)3/2.We remark here that other kinds of background surfaces can also be used but we omit their investigation and discussion here for brevity.Since the lenses in use are often circular, in practice, for designing a PAL lens, the computational domainΩis usually chosen as a larger square containing the circular domain. When one finally finishes the design, one can ignore the other part and keep the targeted circular part as the prototype for manufacturing. Therefore, in our theoretical design, we always choose the computational domain asΩ=[−L2,L2]2withLas the length of the square.Since the functional (2.13) with (2.14) is a typical quadratic functional and it only depends on the second-order partial derivatives with respect to the perturbation functionv(x,y), thus if a functionv0(x,y)minimizes the functionalI(v;w), then it is easy to check that the functionv0(x,y)+l(x,y)also minimizes the functionalI(v;w)provided thatl(x,y)is a linear function on the domainΩ, i.e.l(x,y)=c1x+c2y+c3withc1,c2andc3any three given constants. In order to ensure the uniqueness of the minimizer to the minimization problem, we might fix the values of the perturbation surfacev(x,y)at three points, e.g. three corners, of the domainΩ. Therefore, for designing the surface of PALs, we need to solve the following linearized functional minimization problem with respect to the perturbation surface functionv≔v(x,y):(2.16)(LP){MinI(v;w)=∫Ω=[−L2,L2]2F(x,y,vxx,vxy,vyy)dxdy,v(−L2,−L2)=v(−L2,L2)=v(L2,L2)=0,where the background surfacewis chosen as a spherical surface as (2.15).In the section, we will present a variational-difference numerical method for solving the linearized functional minimization problem(LP)by approximating the integral via trapezoid quadrature rule and derivatives via finite differences.Denote the mesh sizeh=Δx=Δy≔LNwithNa given positive integers and definexi=−L2+ih,i=0,1,…,N;yj=−L2+jh,j=0,1,…,N.We partition the domainΩintoN2sub-squares asΩij={(x,y)∣xi≤x≤xi+1,yj≤y≤yj+1}fori,j=0,1,…,N−1. DenoteThas the set of all grid points, i.e.Th={(xi,yj)∣i,j=0,1,…,N}, which is divided into the set of grid points insideΩ, i.e.Rh={(xi,yj)∣i,j=1,2,…,N−1}, and the set of grid points on the boundary ofΩ, i.e.Sh={(xi,y0)or(xi,yN)∣i=0,1,…,N}∪{(x0,yj)or(xN,yj)∣j=0,1,…,N}. In addition,Shis further split into the set of corner points, i.e.S0={(x0,y0),(x0,yN),(xN,y0),(xN,yN)}, and the set of the remaining points on the boundary, i.e.Sh1={(xi,y0)or(xi,yN)∣i=1,2,…,N−1}∪{(x0,yj)or(xN,yj)∣j=1,2,…,N−1}. Thus we haveTh=Rh∪Sh=Rh∪Sh1∪S0andSh=Sh1∪S0. Based on this partition, we can approximate the integral in (2.16) via the composite trapezoid rule as(3.1)I(v;w)=∑i=0N−1∑j=0N−1∫ΩijF(x,y,vxx,vxy,vyy)dxdy≈∑i=0N−1∑j=0N−1h24(Fi,j+Fi,j+1+Fi+1,j+Fi+1,j+1)=h2[∑(xi,yj)∈RhFi,j+12∑(xi,yj)∈Sh1Fi,j+14∑(xi,yj)∈S0Fi,j],where(3.2)Fi,j=F(xi,yj,vxx(xi,yj),vxy(xi,yj),vyy(xi,yj)),i,j=0,1,…,N.In order to further discretize (3.1), we approximate the derivatives in (3.2) via finite differences. Letvi,jbe the numerical approximation ofv(xi,yj)fori,j=0,1,…,Nand denote the vectorV={vi,j∣i,j=0,1,…,N}. Introduce the following standard finite difference operators (see Fig. 2(a)–(i)):(3.3)δx2vi,j=1h2{vi−1,j−2vi,j+vi+1,j,i=1,2,…,N−1,v0,j−2v1,j+v2,j,i=0,vN,j−2vN−1,j+vN−2,j,i=N,j=0,1,…,N,(3.4)δy2vi,j=1h2{vi,j−1−2vi,j+vi,j+1,j=1,2,…,N−1,vi,0−2vi,1+vi,2,j=0,vi,N−2vi,N−1+vi,N−2,j=N,i=0,1,…,N,(3.5)δxyvi,j=14h2{vi−1,j−1−vi−1,j+1−vi+1,j−1+vi+1,j+1,i,j=1,2,…,N−1,v0,j−1−v0,j+1−v2,j−1+v2,j+1,i=0,j=1,2,…,N−1,vN−2,j−1−vN−2,j+1−vN,j−1+vN,j+1,i=N,j=1,2,…,N−1,vi−1,0−vi−1,2−vi+1,0+vi+1,2,j=0,i=1,2,…,N−1,vi−1,N−2−vi−1,N−vi+1,N−2+vi+1,N,j=N,i=1,2,…,N−1,v0,0−v0,2−v2,0+v2,2,i=0,j=0,v0,N−2−v0,N−v2,N−2+v2,N,i=0,j=N,vN−2,0−vN−2,2−vN,0+vN,2,i=N,j=0,vN−2,N−2−vN−2,N−vN,N−2+vN,N,i=N,j=N.Then the second-order derivatives at the grid points can be approximated as(3.6)vxx(xi,yj)=δx2vi,j+{O(h2),(xi,yj)∈Rh,O(h),(xi,yj)∈Sh,≈δx2vi,j,(3.7)vyy(xi,yj)=δy2vi,j+{O(h2),(xi,yj)∈Rh,O(h),(xi,yj)∈Sh,≈δy2vi,j,i,j=0,1,…,N,(3.8)vxy(xi,yj)=δxyvi,j+{O(h2),(xi,yj)∈Rh,O(h),(xi,yj)∈Sh,≈δxyvi,j.Plugging (3.6)–(3.8) into (3.1), we obtain an approximation to the functionalI(v;w)as(3.9)I(v;w)≈h2[∑(xi,yj)∈RhFi,jh+12∑(xi,yj)∈Sh1Fi,jh+14∑(xi,yj)∈S0Fi,jh]≔Ih(V),where(3.10)Fi,jh=F(xi,yj,δx2vi,j,δxyvi,j,δy2vi,j),i,j=0,1,…,N.Thus the linearized functional minimization problem (2.16) can be approximated by the following finite-dimensional minimization problem:(3.11)(LPh){MinIh(V)=h2[∑(xi,yj)∈RhFi,jh+12∑(xi,yj)∈Sh1Fi,jh+14∑(xi,yj)∈S0Fi,jh],V∈R(N+1)2satisfyingv0,0=v0,N=vN,N=0.Since the functionalIh(V)is a quadratic form of the vectorV, thus the minimization problem (3.11) admits a minimizer which is also a solution of the following linear system:(3.12)∂Ih(V)∂vi,j=0,i,j=0,1,…,N.Inserting the constraintsv0,0=v0,N=vN,N=0into the linear system (3.12), we obtain a linear system with(N+1)2−3unknowns for finding the vectorV, whose coefficient matrix is sparse and symmetric, thus it can be solved very efficiently. We remark here that, if the perturbation surfacevis smooth, then the above discretization is the second-order approximation for the linearized functional. In fact, by denoting(3.13)Ih(v;w)≔h2[∑(xi,yj)∈RhFˆi,jh+12∑(xi,yj)∈Sh1Fˆi,jh+14∑(xi,yj)∈S0Fˆi,jh],with(3.14)Fˆi,jh=F(xi,yj,δx2v(xi,yj),δxyv(xi,yj),δy2v(xi,yj)),i,j=0,1,…,N,noticing (3.1), (2.14), (3.2) and (3.6)–(3.8), using the triangle inequality, we have(3.15)|I(v;w)−Ih(v;w)|≤∑i=0N−1∑j=0N−1|∫ΩijF(x,y,vxx,vxy,vyy)dxdy−h24(Fi,j+Fi,j+1+Fi+1,j+Fi+1,j+1)|+h2[∑(xi,yj)∈Rh|Fi,j−Fˆi,jh|+12∑(xi,yj)∈Sh1|Fi,j−Fˆi,jh|+14∑(xi,yj)∈S0|Fi,j−Fˆi,jh|]≤∑i=0N−1∑j=0N−1C1h4+h2[∑(xi,yj)∈RhC2h2+12∑(xi,yj)∈Sh1C3h+14∑(xi,yj)∈S0C4h]≤C1h4N2+h2[C2h2(N−1)2+2C3h(N−1)+C4h]≤Ch2,whereC1,C2,C3,C4andCare positive constants depending on the functionvand the coefficientsaiin (2.14), but they are independent of the mesh sizeh. We assume here that the integrand functionF(x,y,vxx,vxy,vyy)isC2-continuous for(x,y)∈Ω.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In the paper, we have proposed a variational-difference method for designing the optical free form surface of PAL. The PAL, which has a front surface with three important zones including the far-view, near-view and intermediate zones, is often used to remedy presbyopia by distributing optical powers of the three zones progressively and smoothly. Based on the controls between the refractive optical power deviating from the prescribed power distribution and the unwanted astigmatism, a functional minimization mathematical model was presented. By assuming that the front surface of PALs is a perturbed one around a spherical background surface, we linearized and simplified the mathematical model to a quadratical functional minimization problem. A variational-difference numerical method was proposed for solving the quadratical functional minimization problem. Compared with the existing literature which solves the problem by theB-spline finite element method, the essence of the proposed variational-difference numerical method lies in minimizing the functional directly by the finite difference method rather than in approximating the solution of the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation to the functional. It is very easily understood and implemented by optical engineers, and its memory and computational cost are smaller than that of theB-spline finite element method. Our extensive numerical results indicate that it can produce satisfactory designs for optical engineers in several seconds. We believe that our method could be a powerful candidate tool for designing various specifications of PALs.In the present model, we used the perturbed background surface as a spherical surface and linearized the functional minimization problem(P)in (2.6) to a quadratic functional minimization problem(LP)in (2.16). So are there any better background surfaces, under which we might linearize the problem and obtain better design results? Future extensions may include the revolution surface and other surfaces as the background surfaces. On the other hand, we assumed that the back surface of the PAL is spherical in the paper and discussed how to design the free-form front surface. As a matter of fact, the coupling of the appropriately constructed design for both the back and front surfaces may produce more powerful and effective PALs, and this will be the trend for the design of new generation customized PALs. In future work, we will consider the design of both the back and front surfaces simultaneously, and incorporate more complicated design objectives, such as prescribed astigmatism, prism and many others, into the models.
