@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In many application areas such as airlines and hotels a large number of bookings are typically cancelled. Explicitly taking into account cancellations creates an opportunity for increasing revenue. Motivated by this we propose a revenue management model based on Talluri and van Ryzin (2004) that takes cancellations into account in addition to customer choice behaviour. Moreover, we consider overbooking limits as these are influenced by cancellations. We model the problem as a Markov decision process and propose three dynamic programming formulations to solve the problem, each appropriate in a different setting. We show that in certain settings the problem can be solved exactly using a tractable solution method. For other settings we propose tractable heuristics, since the problem faces the curse of dimensionality. Numerical results show that the heuristics perform almost as good as the exact solution. However, the model without cancellations can lead to a revenue loss of up to 20 percent. Lastly we provide a parameter estimation method based on Newman et al. (2014). This estimation method is fast and provides good parameter estimates. The combination of the model, the tractable and well-performing solution methods, and the parameter estimation method ensures that the model can efficiently be applied in practice.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Revenue management is the practice of deciding which products to sell to which customers at what price under capacity constraints. Classic examples can be found in the aviation industry and the hotel industry, where a limited number of aircraft seats and hotel rooms are available, respectively (e.g., Vinod, 2004; Clarke, 2004). However, the revenue management models can be applied to a wide range of fields, including but not limited to the car rental industry (Geraghty & Johnson, 1997), theatres (Langeveld, 2006), golf courses (Kimes, 2000), restaurants (Guerriero, Miglionico, & Olivito, 2014), and cruise ships (Maddag, Moussawi-Haidar, El-Taha, & Rida, 2010). All application areas have in common that a limited number of perishable goods is sold, whether it is a hotel room, a seat on an aircraft, a rental car, a seat in the theatre, or a timeslot on a golf course. The revenue management models that have been developed exploit this fact such that the price of a product is dynamically adjusted according to the demand and availability of the products. Littlewood (1972) is considered a pioneer in the field. He introduced a capacity control model for two fare-classes on a single flight leg. The natural extension of this model to multiple fare-classes is intractable, but Belobaba (1987a); 1987b); 1989) introduced two effective heuristics EMSR-a and EMSR-b that are still used in practice. Since then several extensions have been made; see McGill and van Ryzin (1999) for an overview.All applications also have in common that customers choose a product among different products. For example, a customer who is looking for a hotel room may compare rooms of different hotels before making a decision. The seminal paper by Talluri and van Ryzin (2004) incorporates customer choice behaviour in revenue management models. Their idea lay the foundation for a new theory in revenue management: customer choice models. Since then the theory of customer choice models has been enriched with among others better solution methods (Meissner & Strauss, 2012; Strauss & Talluri, 2012), network models to take into account multiple night stays or multiple flight legs (Liu & van Ryzin, 2008), and outstanding methods to estimate the parameters of the model (Newman, Garrow, Ferguson, Jacobs, & Purnomo, 2014). However, an extension to a model including cancellations has not been made. Modelling cancellations by taking into account customer choice behaviour has been studied by Iliescu, Garrow, and Parker (2008), but the cancellation process is not integrated with the decision process. Examples of studies on models that include cancellations but do not take into account customer choice behaviour are Lautenbacher, Stidham, and Subramanian (1999), Aydin, Birbil, Frenk, and Noyan (2012), and Bertsimas and Popescu (2003). Lautenbacher et al. (1999) provide an analysis of a revenue management model with cancellations and overbooking, but customer choice behaviour is not considered. Moreover, a satisfactory solution method for their intractable problem is not provided. Recently, Aydin et al. (2012) proposed a revenue management model with cancellations, but they also do not take customer choice behaviour into account. Erdelyi and Topaloglu (2010) and, more recently, Kunnumkal, Talluri, and Topaloglu (2012) provide customer choice models that take into account overbooking but no cancellations.The main contribution of this paper is including cancellations and overbooking in a revenue management model that also takes customer choice behaviour into account. Two other key contributions of this paper are well-performing tractable solution methods and an accurate parameter estimation method with low computation time. The combination of these three contributions makes the customer choice cancellation model very suitable for practitioners.Taking cancellations into account in the decision making process has a big impact on revenue. Numerical results (see Section 5) show that policies that do not take cancellations into account can lead to a substantial revenue loss of 20 percent. So far the customer choice models in existing literature do not take into account cancellations. However, in practice it is common that for example seats on an aircraft are cancelled, hotel rooms are cancelled, theatre tickets are cancelled, reservations for rental cars are cancelled, and reservations for spots on a golf course are cancelled. Therefore we stress that effective revenue management systems should take cancellation into account in the decision making process. Moreover, overbooking makes more sense when taking cancellations into account.We model the problem as a continuous-time Markov decision process and solve it using dynamic programming. Some instances of the problem are too large to solve exactly because of the curse of dimensionality. To overcome this problem we propose three tractable methods, each appropriate under different assumption. First we show that if the cancellation rates are equal and linear with respect to the number of reservations the problem can be reduced to a one-dimensional problem and thus it can be solved exactly. Second we propose an efficient heuristic which is appropriate in the case that the cancellation rates are linear with respect to the number of reservations, but not equal. Third we propose a heuristic that can be applied to general cancellation rates, under the only assumption that cancellations occur independent from each other. We also provide a heuristic which can be applied if we do not assume that all our resources are identical. This occurs if we have multiple room types in a hotel or multiple seat classes in a theatre. Numerical results show that the heuristics perform well.To apply this model in practice it is essential to estimate the parameters of the model accurately. The estimation of parameters of customer choice models can be challenging. A common attempt is to use variations of the expectation maximisation algorithm. The basic version of Talluri and van Ryzin (2004), but also more sophisticated methods (e.g., van Ryzin & Vulcano, 2013) have the drawback of long computation time and bad parameter estimates. Recently Newman et al. (2014) proposed a different parameter estimation method that shows great potential. The parameter estimation method that we propose for our customer choice cancellation model is based on this model. We estimate the parameters of the continuous-time Markov chain, in contrast to most literature (e.g., van Ryzin & Vulcano, 2013), which estimate the parameters of the discretised Markov chain. Our estimation method has the advantage that it has low computation time and it gives good estimates. The combination of the three effective solution methods and the efficient estimation method ensures that the customer choice cancellation model is well applicable in practice.The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. First we describe the customer choice cancellation model in Section 2. In this section we also describe several solution methods: a dynamic programming formulation, which solves the problem exactly but is intractable; two heuristics, which are appropriate in different settings; and a heuristic to solve the problem for a hotel with different room types. Then in Section 4 describe methods to estimate the parameters of the model. Numerical results of the model are presented in Section 5. Finally, in Section 7 we make some concluding remarks and propose topics for further research.In this section we introduce the customer choice cancellation model. It is an extension of the customer choice base model by Talluri and van Ryzin (2004), which does not consider cancellations. First we provide the model with no assumptions on the cancellation behaviour. Second we provide a first reformulation based on the assumption that cancellations only depend on the current number of reservations. Third we provide a reformulation based on the additional assumption that cancellation rates are linear. Finally we provide a reformulation based on the additional assumption that all cancellation rates are equal. In Section 3 we provide effective solution methods for the models.Consider a hotel withC∈Nidentical rooms. We sell the rooms for customer check-in at a fixed future time-unit such that revenue is maximised. The customer check-in is in T time units. A common time unit is days, but some hotels sell rooms for a few hours to accommodate for short stays (e.g., at airport hotels, see Hopman, 2013). We allow overbooking up to Cmax  rooms. A rate or fare product j is a room in combination with a certain price rj, also called the reward for product j, and certain conditions, e.g. cancellation conditions. Typical conditions in a hotel environment are refundable/non-refundable rooms, where a refundable room can be cancelled free of charge and a non-refundable cannot; or breakfast could be included or excluded from the fare product. Let N be the set of all fare products. We assume that there is a finite amount n of fare products, such that w.l.o.g. N = {1, …, n}. Let cj(t) be the costs if product j gets cancelled in time period t. Note that cj(t) depends on the cancellation conditions.We assume that cancellations only depend on the current number of reservations. This model can also be used with time of booking dependent cancellations by including more fare products. We model this problem as a finite-horizon continuous time Markov decision process over T time units. Define the state space byX:={x∈Nn|x≥0,∑j∈Nxj≤Cmax}.Each entry xjof x ∈ X corresponds to the pickup (number of reservations) for product j.There is a penalty q(x) involved if at the arrival day we are in state x and we have more reservations than capacity, i.e.,∑j∈Nxj>C.Customers arrive according to a Poisson process with parameter λ. Continuously in time we decide which subset S⊂N of products we offer. S is called an offer set. If S is offered the probability that an arriving customer buys product j equals Pj(S). Furthermore, the probability that an arriving customer buys nothing under offer set S equals P0(S). Finally, for all products j the cancellations of reservations for product j are exponentially distributed with parameter γj(x). In accordance with Markov decision process literature we call a feasible solution π to our problem a policy. A policy π that optimises total revenue is called an optimal policy. See Fig. 1for a visualisation of this model.To solve the customer choice cancellation model we consider the discretised Markov decision process. We divide time into T time periods, where the length of the intervals is such that the probability that more than one event occurs is very small. Therefore we assume that only one event occurs per time period, where an event is either an arrival, a cancellation, or neither arrival nor cancellation. We denote λ as the probability that a customer arrives in a time period; and γj(x) as the probability that product j is cancelled in state x. The probability that no purchase occurs in a time period equals the sum of the probability that neither an arrival and nor a cancellation occurs, and the probability that an arrival occurs but the arriving customer makes no purchase. This is equal to(1−λ−∑j∈Nγj(x))+λP0(S)=1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−∑j∈Nγj(x).In each time period we decide which set S we offer. Note that time has to be scaled such thatλ+maxx∈X{∑j∈Nγj(x)}≤1,otherwise the probabilities are not well defined. This is possible as X is finite.RemarkIt is possible to incorporate no-shows and walk-ins into this model. Subramanian et al. (Lautenbacher et al., 1999) do this by incorporating it in the penalty q(x). However, it is also possible to incorporate the walk-in probability in the arrival probability and the no-show probability in the cancellation probability in the last time step(s). We choose the latter method.It is reasonable to assume that cancellations occur independent of each other. Assumption 2.1 below states that the probability that product j is cancelled only depends on the current number of reservations xjfor product j. The assumption is equivalent to Assumption 1 in Subramanian et al. (Lautenbacher et al., 1999).Assumption 2.1Independence of Cancellations (Assumption 1 inLautenbacher et al., 1999)γj(x) = γj(xj) for all x ∈ X, for some functionγj:N→R+To emphasize the fact that we work under the independence of cancellations assumption we write γj(xj) instead of γj(x). Note that x is a vector and xjis a scalar.Assumption 2.2 below is even stronger than Assumption 2.1.Assumption 2.2Linear Cancellation Rates1.γj(xj) = γjxj, forγj∈R+,for all j ∈ Nq(x1) = q(x2) for all x1, x2 ∈ X with∑j∈Nxj1=∑j∈Nxj2.The second part of Assumption 2.2 states that the penalty for overbooking only depends on the total number of products that are sold and is independent from the types of products that are sold. This assumption is realistic because we are dealing with identical rooms, so relocation to a similar hotel induces the same costs. This is also a very convenient step if we only want to keep track of the total number of reservations instead of the number of reservations per fare product. For x ∈ X, let y denote the total number of reservations, i.e.,y=∑j∈Nxj.Then under the linear cancellation rates assumption we write q(y) = q(x) for all x with ∑j ∈ Nxj= y.Assumption 2.3 below states that the cancellation probability is independent from the product j, but it still depends on the number of reservations of product j.Assumption 2.3Linear and equal cancellation rates1.γj(x) = γxj, forγ∈Rand for all j ∈ Nq(x) = q(y) with y = ∑j ∈ NxjUnder the linear and equal cancellation rates assumption the state space of the problem is significantly reduced, as is shown in Theorem 3.1 in Section 3. However, this assumption is not realistic. Different fare products are likely to have different cancellation probabilities. For example, a refundable room is more likely to get cancelled than a non-refundable room.An illustration of the model can be found in Example 2.1 below. This example is used throughout the paper.Example 2.111This example is based on Example 1 from Talluri and van Ryzin (2004). We scaled the rewards to be representative values for hotels. Moreover, we added cancellation conditions, cancellation probabilities, and an overbooking policy.Consider a hotel withC∈Nrooms which offers three fare products. The reward for these products is given byr=(r1,r2,r3)=(160,100,90).Both fare product 2 and 3 need to be purchased at least 21 days ahead. Furthermore, the cancellation conditions are as follows: if a product of type j is cancelled, the customer receives a refund ofcj={r1ifj=1,12r2ifj=2,0ifj=3.In other words, product 1 is refundable, product 2 only refunds half the price, and product 3 is non-refundable. Assume that overbooking is allowed but is bounded by 20 percent of the capacity, such thatCmax=⌊C65⌋. If we have ∑j ∈ Nxj− C > 0 overbookings, then ∑j ∈ Nxj− C reservations are chosen at random and relocated to another hotel. The costs for relocating a customer is 170. Hence the penalty for overbooking q(x) at the arrival day in state x equals{170(∑j∈Nxj−C)if∑j∈Nxj−C>0,0otherwise.The hotel wants to sell the rooms in a period of T days. The purchase probabilities Pj(S) are given in Table 1. We assume that the purchase probabilities are the same for all time periods. The probability that a reservation for product j is cancelled isγj(x)=γjxj,with γj∈ [0, 1] for all j.In this section we provide solution methods for the models derived in Section 2. First we provide an exact solution method based on dynamic programming for the model with no restrictions on cancellation behaviour. Unfortunately this problem faces the curse of dimensionality. To overcome this we provide heuristics for each model described in Section 2. In particular we provide a tractable solution method that solves the model under the linear and equal cancellations Assumption 2.3 exactly. Finally we provide a heuristic that is applicable to a hotel with multiple room types.Let Vt(x) be the maximal expected revenue from time t to the arrival day. To solve this problem we use the following Bellman equation:(1)Vt(x)={maxS⊂N{λ∑j∈SPj(S)(rj+Vt−1(x+ej))ift>0,+∑j∈Nγj(x)(−cj(t)+Vt−1(x−ej))+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−∑j∈Nγj(x))Vt−1(x)}q(x)ift=0,for all x ∈ X with whereej∈Rnis the jth unit vector. With dynamic programming we can find an optimal strategy. Unfortunately, this solution methods bears the burden of the curse of dimensionality. The size of the state space X is O(Cn), so it increases exponentially if the number of fare products increases. For a small number of fare products the exact solution can be computed, like in Example 2.1. Obviously, in practice the number of fare products is larger than in our small example. Hence this problem can not be solved for all practical purposes. To overcome this problem we propose several options. First we show in Theorem 3.1 that under certain conditions the problem can be solved exactly. Second we propose several heuristics in case the conditions of Theorem 3.1 are not satisfied. It will turn out that each heuristic has its own advantages and disadvantages and is appropriate in a different setting.RemarkIn contrast to the dynamic programming formulation of Subramanian et al. (Lautenbacher et al., 1999) the structure of an optimal policy is not clear beforehand. The main difference between the models is that we also consider customer choice behaviour. However, if the purchase probabilties follow an independent model, as described by Talluri and van Ryzin (2004), we do get similar admission control policies. More precisely, if the purchase probabilities are given byPj(S)={pjifj∈S,0otherwise,then an optimal policy of Eq. (1) will have the formaccept a fare-product j request if and only if rj+ Vt − 1(x + ej) > Vt − 1(x).In the remainder of this paper we focus on dependent demand models.The customer choice cancellation model can be reformulated such that the costs are incorporated in the rewards. We do this by adding the expected costs caused by cancellations to the value function. This reasoning is borrowed from Lautenbacher et al. (1999), who use it in their revenue management model which does not take customer choice behaviour into account. We show in Theorem 3.1 below that under certain conditions the customer choice cancellation model is equivalent to a one-dimensional problem.Let H(x, t) be the expected costs from cancellations from the reservations in state (x, t). The costs are fixed because we do not have control over the reservations. Then H(x, t) is given by the recursive formulaH(x,t)={∑j∈Nγj(x)(cj(t)+H(x−ej,t−1))+(1−∑j∈Nγj(x))H(x,t−1)ift>0,0ift=0.Define the value functionV˜t(x)by(2)V˜t(x):=Vt(x)+H(x,t).The value functionV˜t(x)can be interpreted as the maximal expected revenue to go from reservations without costs from current cancellations. These costs are unavoidable and have no influence on future profits. Note that cancellations still occur, but it will turn out that this reformulation alters the cancellation term in a preferable way.Define ΔHj(x, t) ≔ H(x, t − 1) − H(x + ej, t − 1) for all x ∈ X and for all t > 0. Then we can rewriteV˜t(x)as follows:(3)V˜t(x)={maxS⊂N{λ∑j∈SPj(S)(rj+ΔHj(x,t)+V˜t−1(x+ej))ift>0+∑j∈Nγj(x)(V˜t−1(x−ej))+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−∑j∈Nγj(x))V˜t−1(x)},q(x)ift=0.Eq. (3) is equivalent to Eq. (1) in the sense that it leads to the same policy. This follows from Eq. (2) and the fact that the policy to go has no influence on H(x, t).The customer choice base model has some elegant properties described in Talluri and van Ryzin (2004) which reduce the action space and therefore the computation time. Unfortunately, these properties do not hold in the customer choice cancellation model. To show this, we introduce the concept of efficient sets in Definition 3.1 below (Definition 1 in Talluri & van Ryzin, 2004). We will show later on that some heuristics do satisfy some of the elegant properties described in Talluri and van Ryzin (2004).Definition 3.1For each S ⊂ N, x ∈ X and t ∈ {0, …, T} define Q(S) and R(S) byQ(S):=∑j∈SPj(S),R(S,x,t):=∑j∈SPj(S)(rj+ΔHj(x,t)).A set S* is called inefficient at (x, t), with x ∈ X and t ∈ {0, …, T}, if there exist α(S) > 0 for all S ⊂ N with ∑S ⊂ Nα(S) = 1 such that both of the following inequalities hold:Q(S*)≥∑S⊂Nα(S)Q(S),R(S*,x,t)<∑S⊂Nα(S)R(S,x,t).Otherwise S* is called efficient at (x, t).The intuition behind efficient sets is as follows. An offer set S* ⊂ N is efficient if there is no randomisation of other offer sets S ⊂ N such that the expected reward is strictly greater than R(S*, x, t) and the probability of a purchase is at most Q(S*). Efficient sets are on the efficient frontier of the trade-off between the expected revenue R(S*, x, t) and the probability of purchase Q(S*).Efficient sets can be identified using the largest marginal revenue procedure described by Talluri and van Ryzin (2004), which is the following: Initialise with the first efficient set S0 = ∅. Then iteratively proceed as follows: Suppose Siis the i-th efficient set found by the procedure. Then the (i + 1)th efficient set Si+1 is equal toSi+1=argmaxS:Q(S)≥Q(Si)R(S,x,t)≥R(Si,x,t)R(S,x,t)−R(Si,x,t)Q(S)−Q(Si).The complexity of this procedure is O(m2n), where m is the number of efficient sets, which is at most 2n. For large instances of n this procedure is computationally intractable, so then we need to use heuristics. One heuristic (proposed by Talluri & van Ryzin, 2004) is to use only a subset of all efficient sets and then use the largest marginal revenue procedure. By looking at the specific instance we can rule out certain offer-sets. For example, if a hotel offers the same room under the same conditions at two different prices €80 and €120 at the same time, the price-sensitive customer would almost surely purchase the room for €80.In the base model no cancellations exist, such that ΔHj(x, t) = 0 for all (x, t). Hence, the set of efficient sets is the same for each (x, t). In contrast, for the cancellation model the set of efficient sets is not necessarily the same for all (x, t), as is shown in Example 3.1.Example 3.1Consider Example 2.1. Let C = 5, T = 10, γ = (0.05, 0.0025, 0.001). Consider the states (x, t1) and (x, t2), with t1 = 1, t2 = 10, and x = (0, 0, 0). The efficient sets of state (x, t1) and (x, t1) are given in Table 2. Offer set {1, 3} is efficient in state (x, t1) but not in state (x, t2), and offer set {1, 2} is not efficient in state (x, t1) but it is efficient in state (x, t2).An important property of the base model is that an inefficient set is never an optimal solution (see Proposition 2 in Talluri & van Ryzin, 2004). Unfortunately, this property generally does not hold for the cancellation model. To this end consider Example 3.2.Example 3.2Consider Example 3.1. In state x = (0, 0, 4) at time T offer set {1, 3} is an optimal offer set. However, offer set {1, 2} is not efficient in state x at time T, as was shown in Example 3.1.The model under the linear and equal cancellation Assumption 2.3 turns out to have the elegant property that it can tractably be solved exactly. In order to see this we use some derivations similar to Lautenbacher et al. (1999).First consider the model under the independence of cancellations Assumption 2.1. The statement in Lemma 3.1 is taken from Lautenbacher et al. (1999).Lemma 3.1Lemma 2 in Lautenbacher et al., 1999Under Assumption2.1we have thatH(x,t)=∑j∈NHj(xj,t),where the function Hj(xj, t), 1 ≤ j ≤ n, satisfy the following recursive equations:Hj(xj,t)={(1−γj(xj))Hj(xj,t−1)ift>0+γj(xj)(cj(t)+Hj(xj−1,t−1))0ift=0.for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T.Define ΔHj(xj, t) byΔHj(xj,t):=Hj(xj+1,t−1)−Hj(xj,t−1).Lemma 3.2 below states that under the independence of cancellations assumption Eq. (3) can be simplified.Lemma 3.2UnderAssumption 2.1(Eq. 3) can be rewritten toV˜t(x)={maxS⊂N{λ∑j∈SPj(S)(rj−ΔHj(x,t)+V˜t−1(x+ej))ift>0,+∑j∈Nγj(xj)(V˜t−1(x−ej))+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−∑j∈Nγj(xj))V˜t−1(x)}q(x)ift=0.where ΔHj(xj, t) satisfies the following recursive formulaΔHj(xj,t)={(γj(xj+1)−γj(xj))cj(t)ift>1,+(1−γj(xj+1))ΔHj(xj,t−1)+γj(xj)ΔHj(xj−1,t−1)0ift=1.Now consider the linear cancellations Assumption 2.2. Lemma 3.3 below simplifies the calculations of ΔHj(xj, t) even further. The statement is taken from Lautenbacher et al. (1999).Lemma 3.3Lemma 3 in Lautenbacher et al., 1999UnderAssumption 2.2ΔHj(xj, t) is independent of the number of reservations xj such that we can write ΔHj(t) = ΔHj(xj, t) for all j ∈ N. Moreover, ΔHj(t) satisfiesΔHj(t)={γjcj(t)+(1−γj)ΔHj(t−1)ift>1,0ift=1,for all j ∈ N.Finally, consider the model under the linear and equal cancellations Assumption 2.3. Theorem 3.1 below shows that the states of the problem is significantly reduced. The statement is an extension of Theorem 1 in Lautenbacher et al. (1999) with customer choice behaviour.Theorem 3.1UnderAssumption 2.3we have thatV˜t(x)=W˜t(y)for all (x, t), where y = ∑j∈Nxj andW˜t(y)is given by the following formula:(4)W˜t(y)={maxS⊂N{λ∑j∈SPj(S)(rj−ΔHj(t)+W˜t−1(y+1))ift>0,+γyW˜t−1(y−1)+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−γy)W˜t−1(y)}q(y)ift=0.We proof thatV˜t(x)=W˜t(y)by induction to t. For t = 0 we have thatV˜(x,0)=q(x)andW˜(y,0)=q(y). By Assumption 2.3 we have thatV˜(x,0)=q(x)=q(y)=W˜(y,0),so the statement holds for t = 0.Suppose t > 0 and the statement holds for all values smaller than t. By Assumption 2.3, Lemma 3.2, and Lemma 3.3 we have thatV˜t(x)=maxS⊂N{λ∑j∈SPj(S)(rj−ΔHj(t)+V˜t−1(x+ej))+γ∑j∈Nxj(V˜t−1(x−ej))+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−γ∑j∈Nxj)V˜t−1(x)}.Using the induction hypothesis we can rewrite this toV˜t(x)=maxS⊂N{λ∑j∈SPj(S)(rj−ΔHj(t)+W˜t−1(y+1))+γyW˜t−1(y−1)+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−γy)W˜t−1(y)},and henceV˜t(x)=W˜t(y).□Example 3.2 showed that in general inefficient sets can be optimal. However, under Assumption 2.3 ineffcient sets are never an optimal solution, as Proposition 3.1 below states. The set of efficient sets still depends on (x, t), so unfortunately these efficient sets are not of much use to us.Proposition 3.1An ineffcient set is never an optimal solution to (Eq. 4).See Appendix A.□The Independence of Cancellations heuristic is appropriate for the model under the independence of cancellations Assumption 2.1. The goal of this heuristic is to find a solution under a model with general assumptions. In this approach we reduce the state space by only keeping track of the total number of reservations rather than the number of reservations per product. Again we make the assumption that the probability that product j is cancelled depends only on the number of reservations for product j, i.e.,γjt(x)=γjt(xj)(see the independence of cancellations Assumption 2.1), but we make no further assumptions. The advantage of this heuristic is that it can be applied to problems with general cancellation probability functions.Define the one-dimensional state space Y byY:={y∈N|0≤y≤Cmax}.Each state y ∈ Y corresponds to the total number of reservations. Let γ(y, t) be the conditional probability that a reservation is cancelled in state (y, t). Let c(y, t) be the expected costs for a cancelled reservation in state (y, t). The Bellman equation corresponding to this problem is(5)Wt(y)={maxS⊂N{λ∑j∈SPj(S)(rj+Wt−1(y+1))ift>0,+γ(y,t)(−c(y,t)+Wt−1(y−1))+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−γ(y,t))Wt−1(y)},q(y)ift=0.The problem with using this one-dimensional state space is that we do not know the expected costs c(y, t) and the conditional cancellation probability γ(y, t). This follows from the fact that we do not know the mix of reservations on the books, since if we are in state y ∈ Y we could be in any state x ∈ X with∑j=1nxj=y.The current mix of reservations on the books depends on the past strategy and therefore c(y, t) and γ(y, t) depend on the past strategy. To overcome this problem we propose the following procedure to estimate c(y, t) and γ(y, t).Let π be an arbitrary strategy. Letx¯(y,t)∈Rnbe the expected mix of reservations on the books in state y at time t. Let p(y, t) be the probability that we are in state y at time t. Letpty(xj=k)be the probability that we have k reservations for product j in state (y, t). For strategy π we will explain a recursive procedure to calculatex¯(y,t),p(y, t),pty(xj=k),γ(y, t), and c(y, t).Let y and t be arbitrary and suppose we knowx¯(y′,t′),p(y′, t′), γ(y′, t′),pt′y′(xj=k),and c(y′, t′) for all t′ < t, for all k and j, and for all y′. Then we can evaluate their values as stated in Lemma 3.4 and Lemma 3.5 below.Lemma 3.4Definep^ty(xj=k)byp^ty(xj=k)=p(y+1,t+1)[pt+1y+1(xj=k+1)γjt+1(k+1)+pt+1y+1(xj=k)∑i≠j∑k′=0y+1−kpt+1y+1(xi=k′)γit+1(k′)]+p(y,y+1)pt+1y(xj=k)[1−λ∑i∈SP(S,i)−∑i≠j∑k′=0y−kpt+1y(xi=k′)γit+1(k′)−γjt+1(k)]+p(y−1,t+1)[pt+1y−1(xj=k−1)λPj(S)+pt+1y−1(xj=k)λ∑i∈S∖{j}Pj(S)],for all k. Thenpty(xj=k)is given bypty(xj=k)=p^ty(xj=k)∑k′=0yp^ty(xj=k′).See Appendix A.□(y, t).The proof that inefficient sets are never an optimal solution toEq. (5)is analoguous to the proof ofProposition 3.1.The goal of the second heuristic is to be fast and efficient. To accomplish this we do the following:–We work under the linear cancellation ratesAssumption 2.2. This way the model is restricted, but we gain computation time.We only keep track of the total number of reservations. We loose the information that we have if we keep track of the number of reservations per product, but we gain computation time.We only consider efficient sets in our policy. Then the computation time is reduced because we need to consider less solutions, but we loose some potential better solutions.We use the same set of efficient sets in each state. We gain computation time because we do not have to evaluate the efficient sets for each state, but we loose some potential better solutions.In the second heuristic we work under the linear cancellation rates, i.e., we assume that γj(xj) = γjxjfor all j. The heuristic can also be applied if we work under the linear and equal cancellation rates Assumption 2.3, since this assumption is a special case of the linear cancellation rates assumption. We solve a one-dimensional problem, where we only keep track of the total number of reservations and not of the reservations per product. We reformulate the problem such that the costs of cancellations are incorporated in the maximisation term of the Bellman equation, as described in Theorem 3.1. Only this time we only consider offer sets that are efficient. In particular, we choose the efficient sets that result from taking R(S, x, t) = 0 for all (x, t). The motivation for choosing only these efficient sets is that the numerical results in Section 5 show that (a) leaving out inefficient solutions does not have a great impact on performance; and (b) choosing among the efficient sets is better than choosing among an equal number of arbitrary sets. The Bellman equation that we have to solve is given by(6)W˜t(y)={maxS⊂Nefficient{λ∑j∈SPj(S)(rj−ΔHj(t)+W˜t−1(y+1))ift>0,+γyW˜t−1(y−1)+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−γy)W˜t−1(y)}q(y)ift=0.However, we assume that the cancellation probabilities differ per product. We do not know the cancellation probability γ if we are in state y, since we do not know what the mix of reservations on the books is. This problem is similar to the problem we described in Section 3.3. We could use Lemma 3.5 to approximate γ iteratively, but this is computationally expensive. Moreover, numerical results show that simpler approximations outperform this method (see also Section 5). An example of a simple approximation of γ is taking the average of all γ’s:(7)γ:=1n∑j∈Nγj.The advantage of using this method over the Independence of Cancellations algorithm is that it is computationally faster and performs better under the linear cancellation rates assumption. However, the downside of this method is that it can not be applied to general cancellation probabilities. See Algorithm 3.1 for an overview of the heuristic.Algorithm 3.1Linear Cancellation Rates Heuristic (LCR)1.Estimateγ^by using (γj), for example by (Eq. 7).Find an optimal strategy of (Eq. 6).In practice hotels often have multiple room types. However, we made the assumption that the hotel has C rooms of the same type. Expanding the solution space with multiple room types leads to an intractable problem. To solve this problem we combine the Linear Cancellation Rates heuristic of Section 3.4 with one-step improvement, i.e., one step of the well know policy iteration (see also Puterman (1994)). In this approach we first find an approximation of the value function, and then use one maximisation step of policy iteration to find a better solution.First we consider the different room types separately. LetIbe the set of room types. For each room typei∈Iwe have a certain capacity Ci. For each room type we only keep track of the total number of reservations for that room type. Under the linear and equal cancellation rates Assumption 2.3 this gives the exact solution; see Theorem 3.1. Let Sibe the offer set of products for room type i and let Nibe the set of products for room type i. We solve the problem per room type, as if it would be the only room type we have, using the Linear Cancellation Rates Heuristic described in Section 3.4. The Bellman equation per room typei∈Iis given by(8)W˜ti(y)={maxSi⊂Niefficient{λ∑j∈SiPj(Si)(rj−ΔHj(t)+W˜t−1i(y+1))ift>0+γiyW˜t−1i(y−1)+(1−λ∑j∈SiPj(Si)−γiy)W˜t−1i(y)}q(y)ift=0.Let u be the vector containing the number of reservations per room type, such that uirepresents the number of reservations for room typei∈I. Then we want to solve the following recursive formula:Ut(u)={maxS⊂N{λ∑i∈I[∑j∈SiPj(Si)(rj−ΔHj(t)+Ut−1(u+ei))]ift>0,+∑i∈I[∑j∈NiγjujUt−1(u−ei)]+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−∑j∈Nγjuj)Ut−1(u)}q(u)ift>0.However, this problem is still too large to solve, even if we use a small number of room types. Therefore we use one-step improvement to solve this problem. Suppose u is the current state and we wish to decide which products to offer. We approximate Ut−1(u) by the following formula:(9)U˜t−1(u):=∑i∈IW˜t−1i(ui).U˜t−1(u+ei)andU˜t−1(u−ei)can be approximated similarly. Then we do one maximisation step to find an approximationU¯t(u)for Ut(u):(10)U¯t(u)={maxS∈N{λ∑i∈I[∑j∈SiPj(Si)(rj−ΔHj(t)+U˜t−1(u+ei))]ift>0,+∑i∈I[∑j∈NiγjxjU˜t−1(u−ei)]+(1−λ∑j∈SPj(S)−∑j∈Nγjxj)U˜t−1(u)}q(u)ift=0.The multiple room type heuristic is summarised in Algorithm 3.2 below.Algorithm 3.2Multiple Room Types1.Fix state u.EvaluateW˜t−1i(ui),W˜t−1i(ui+1),andW˜t−1i(ui−1)using (Eq. 8) for alli∈I.DefineU˜t−1(u),U˜t−1(u+ei),andU˜t−1(u−ei)using (Eq. 9).Use Eq. (10) to find an improved approximationU¯t(u)of Ut(u).The action space of this problem is still large, even though we only use efficient sets per room type. The concept of efficient sets is only defined for single-resource problems. In the context of multiple room types it is worth looking into a generalisation of efficient sets to multiple-resource problems. However, this is beyond the scope of this paper.In this section we propose a method to estimate the parameters of the model from real data. Ideally we use an estimation model under perfect knowledge, i.e., we assume we know (a) which products were offered at what time, (b) when customers arrived, (c) when they made a purchase, and (d) when they cancelled their reservation. A maximum-likelihood estimation model under perfect knowledge is described in Appendix B. In practice not all information is available, unfortunately. For example, the no-purchase option is rarely observed. To overcome this problem we need to consider methods that deal with censored data. One method is the well-known expectation-maximisation algorithm, which is described in Appendix B. However, the expectation-maximisation algorithm is unattractive for practical purposes for two reasons. First, the computation time is notoriously long. Second, the method estimates the parameters of the discretised model instead of the continuous model, which may lead to estimation errors. To overcome these problems we propose an estimation model that is based on the excellent estimation method proposed by Newman et al. (2014). The proposed method assumes the linear cancellation rates Assumption 2.2 and that the purchase probabilties are modelled by the multinomial logit model (MNL), which is briefly explained in Appendix B.In what follows the purchase probabilities and the offer set depend on the time period. Therefore we introduce the following notation. Let Ztjbe the variable containing values of the attributes of product j in time period t and let Zt= {Ztj}j. Let Stbe the set of products that is offered in time period t. Let α be the utility of the no-purchase alternative. For convenience we introduce some notation. Let Ptj(α, β, St, Zt) be the probability that product j is purchased in time period t under α, β, St, and Zt, i.e.,Ptj(α,β,St,Zt):=exp(β⊤Zjt)exp(α)+∑i∈Stexp(β⊤Zit).Define the probability Pt0(α, β, St, Zt) that the no-purchase option is chosen asPt0(α,β,St,Zt):=exp(α)exp(α)+∑i∈Stexp(β⊤Zit).It is convenient to use the probability Pt*(α, β, St, Zt) that a product is purchased, i.e., the probability that the no-purchase alternative is not chosen. Hence Pt*(α, β, St, Zt) is given byPt*(α,β,St,Zt):=∑j∈StPtj(α,β,St,Zt)=∑j∈Stexp(β⊤Zjt)exp(α)+∑i∈Stexp(β⊤Zit)=1−Pt0(α,β,St,Zt).Finally, let Ptj|*(β, St, Zt) be the probability that product j is purchased under the condition that the customer made a purchase, i.e.,Ptj|*(β,St,Zt):=exp(β⊤Zjt)∑i∈Stexp(β⊤Zit).We divide time into T time periods and assume that the parameters to be estimated are constant within these periods. Note that we allow more than one event to happen in one time period. The parameters that we need to estimate are: the no-purchase utility α; the weights β of the attributes of the MNL model; the parameters γjof the exponential distributions that model the cancellations; and the parameter λ of the Poisson process that models the arriving customers. We do this by using maximum likelihood estimation.Assume that the offer set Stdoes not change within this time period. Suppose we observe zjtpurchases for product j in time period t. Let ζj(y) be the total number of cancellations for product j when there were y reservations for product j, measured over all time periods. Suppose that we observe that for a period of tj(y) there were y reservations for product j, again measured over all time periods. Note that tj(y) might be 0.The maximum likelihood function L(z, ζ|α, β, γ, λ) is the probability that we observe z and ζ under given α, β, γ, and λ. Since the arrival process is independent from the cancellation process we can writep(z,ζ|α,β,γ,λ)=p(z|α,β,γ,λ)p(ζ|α,β,γ,λ),with p(z|α, β, γ, λ) the probability that we observe z given α, β, γ, and λ; and p(ζ|α, β, γ, λ) the probability that we observe ζ given α, β, γ, and λ. Since the cancellations are only dependent on γ we can even writep(ζ|α,β,γ,λ)=p(ζ|γ),with p(ζ|γ) the probability that we observe ζ given γ. This also follows from the derivations below.The cancellation processes are independent from each other, so we can writep(ζ|γ)=∏j∈Np(ζj|γj),with p(ζj|γj) the probability that we observe ζjgiven γj. Moreover, if we consider the time intervals tj(y) we can writep(ζj|γj)=∏y=0Cmaxp(ζj(y)|γj).Since the cancellations follow a Poisson process with parameter γjytj(y) the probability p(ζj(y)|γj) that we observe ζj(y) cancellations in time period t conditional on γjis equal top(ζj(y)|γj)=(γjytj(y))ζj(y)e−γjytj(y)ζj(y)!.If we take the natural logarithm of p(ζj(y)|γj) we getlog(p(ζj(y)|γj))=ζj(y)log(γj)+ζj(y)log(ytj(y))−γjytj(y)−log(ζj(y)!).Combining all equations we findlog(p(ζ|γ))=∑j∈N∑y=0Cmax[{ζj(y)log(γj)−γjytj(y)}+{ζj(y)log(ytj(y))−log(ζj(y)!)}].If we want to maximise this with respect to γ we can solve the following equations separately for each j ∈ N:(11)∑y=0Cmaxζj(y)log(γj)−γjytj(y).If we take the first derivative with respect to γjwe find1γj∑y=0Cmaxζj(y)−∑y=0Cmaxytj(y).The optimum can be found by setting this equation to zero. This givesγj=∑y=0Cmaxζ(y)∑y=0Cmaxytj(y).Letζj:=∑y=0Cmaxζ(y),i.e., ζjis the total number of cancellations for product j. Then we have that(12)γj=ζj∑y=0Cmaxytj(y).By taking the second derivative of Eq. (11) we find−1γj2∑y=0Cmaxζj(y),which is negative, such that the optimum found in Eq. (12) is a maximum.For completeness we below present the derivations of the results by Newman et al. (2014), which can directly be applied to our model.The expression for p(z|α, β, γ, λ) does not depend on γ so we can write p(z|α, β, λ). Conditioning to the number of reservations mtin time period t givesp(z|α,β,λ)=p(z|m,β,λ)p(m|α,β,λ),where m = (m1, …, mT). Note that p(z|m, β, λ) does not depend on the no-purchase alternative parameter α. The probability p(z|m, β, λ) that we observe z under the conditions that we observe mtreservations with parameter β and λ is equal top(z|m,β,λ)=∏t=1T(mtz1t,…,znt)∏j∈N[Ptj|*(β,St,Zt)]zjt.Note that since ∑j ∈ Nzjt= mtand zjt= 0 for j ∉ Stwe have that∏j∈N[Ptj|*(β,St,Zt)]zjt=∏j∈St[exp(β⊤Zjt)∑i∈Stexp(β⊤Zit)]zjt=∏j∈St[exp(β⊤Zjt)]zjt[∑i∈Stexp(β⊤Zit)]mt.By taking the natural logarithm we findlog(p(z|m,α,β,λ))=∑t=1Tlog(mt!z1t!·…·znt!)+∑j∈Stzjtβ⊤Zjt−mtlog(∑i∈Stexp(β⊤Zit)).If we want to maximise this with respect to β we only have to consider(13)∑t=1T[∑j∈Stzjtβ⊤Zjt−mtlog(∑i∈Stexp(β⊤Zit))].On the other hand, mtfollows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ∑i ∈ SPt*(α, β, St, Zt). Therefore the probability p(m|α, β, λ) that we observe mtreservations in time period t is given byp(m|α,β,λ)=∏t=1T[λ∑i∈SPt*(α,β,St,Zt)]mte−λPt*(α,β,St,Zt)mt!.Taking the logarithm gives(14)log(p(m|α,β,λ))=∑t=1Tmt[log(λPt*(α,β,St,Zt))]−λPt*(α,β,St,Zt)−log(mt!).Note that if we maximise Eq. (14) with respect to α and λ we can ignore the last term. The first partial derivative with respect to λ equals1λ∑t=1Tmt−∑t=1TPt*(α,β,St,Zt).The optimum is attained at(15)λ=∑t=1Tmt∑t=1TPt*(α,β,St,Zt),where∑t=1Tmtis the total number of observed reservations. The second partial derivative with respect to λ equals−1λ2∑t=1Tmt,which is negative for λ ≠ 0, so the optimum from Eq. (15) is a maximum. We can replace λ in Eq. (14) by Eq. (15), which gives(16)log(p(mt|α,β,λ))=∑t=1Tmtlog(∑t=1Tmt∑t=1TPt*(α,β,St,Zt)Pt*(α,β,St,Zt))−∑t=1Tmt∑t=1TPt*(α,β,St,Zt)Pt*(α,β,St,Zt)−log(mt!).If β is given we can find α by maximising Eq. (16) with respect to α. Then we can find λ by using Eq. (15).The estimation procedure is summarised in Algorithm 4.1.Algorithm 4.1Three-Step Continuous1.Findγ^using (Eq. 12).Findβ^using (Eq. 13).Use the estimateβ^to findα^using (Eq. 16). Then useβ^andα^to findλ^using (Eq. 15).Theorem 4.1 below states that Algorithm 4.1 provides consistent estimators. Moreover, the estimator for the cancellation parameters γ is an unbiased estimator.Theorem 4.1As the sample size increases,Algorithm 4.1leads to consistent estimators. Moreover, the estimator for γ found by (Eq. 12) is unbiased.Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 in Newman et al. (2014) show that the estimators of β and (α, λ) are consistent, respectively.To show that the estimatorγ^of the cancellation parameter found by Eq. (12) is a consistent estimator, we consider the cancellation parameters separately per product. Consider a product j ∈ N. Letγj*be the true parameter and letγjkbe the parameter obtained using Eq. (12) with sample size k. In other words,γjk=∑y=0Cmaxζjk(y)∑y=0Cmaxytjk(y),withζjk(y)the observed number of cancellations in state y andtjk(y)the observed time spend in state y with k observations. We can think of one observation as an arrival day with all booking history. The expected number of cancellations when the state is y is equal toγj*ytjk(y). Note thattjk(y)is the sum of k i.i.d. random variables tj(y), where tj(y) is the time spend in state y for one observation. As the sample size increases, we have thatlimk→∞ytjk(y)k=γj*yE[tj(y)].On the other hand,ζjk(y)is the sum of k i.i.d. random variables ζj(y), where ζj(y) is the number of cancellations for one observation. As the sample size increases, we have thatlimk←∞ζjk(y)k=E[ζj(y)]=E[E[ζj(y)|tj(y)]]=E[γj*ytj(y)]=γj*yE[tj(y)].Hence we have thatlimk→∞γjk=limk→∞1k∑y=0Cmaxζjk(y)1k∑y=0Cmaxytjk(y)=γj*∑y=0CmaxyE[tj(y)]∑y=0CmaxyE[tj(y)]=γj*,so Eq. (12) provides a consistent estimator. Moreover, using conditional expectation it follows thatE[γjk]=E[E{∑y=0Cmaxζjk(y)∑y=0Cmaxytjk(y)|tjk(·)}]=E[∑y=0Cmaxγj*ytjk(y)∑y=0Cmaxytjk(y)]=γ*,so Eq. (12) provides an unbiased estimator.□In this section numerical results are provided to validate the customer choice cancellation model. The four main results that are provided are: (1) the fast computation time of the estimation method described in Section 4; (2) the fast computation time of the heuristics; (3) the good performance of the heuristics; and (4) the performance of the heuristics under estimated parameters. The parameters that are used are based on Simulation Example 2 in Talluri and van Ryzin (2004). Let n = 10 be the number of products sold with corresponding price vectorr=(240,220,190,160,120,112,96,80,74,70).Demand, cancellation rates, and purchase probabilities are independent from the time period t. To allow the study of the effect of high volume in demand and low volume in demand the load factor l is introduced. In our studies we use l ∈ {0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4}. Demand λ per time unit is then defined asλ(C,l,T)=ClT.A low value of l implies a low demand relative to the capacity C and a high value of l implies a high demand relative to the capacity C.Purchase probabilities are modelled by the MNL model. The only attribute that we consider is price, but we assume that there exist high price-sensitive and low price-sensitive customers which have different parameters βH= −0.005 and βL= −0.0015, respectively (as in Talluri & van Ryzin, 2004). The no-purchase parameter is set to α = 0 such that the MNL model is the same as in Talluri and van Ryzin (2004). We allow overbooking up to 20 percent of the total capacity C. Cancellation rates are assumed linear and the parametersγ∈Rndepend on l and T in the following way:γ=(0.720,0.320,0.560,0.280,0.200,0.360,0.160,0.080,0.008,0.040)lT=(18/25,8/25,14/25,7/25,1/5,9/25,4/25,2/25,1/125,1/25)lT.The policies that follow from the heuristics need to be compared using the corresponding revenue. For small problem instances the exact solution method can be used, but for larger instances the problem instance is intractable. In that case simulation is used to estimate the revenue corresponding to a policy. The estimation errors are between 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent.An estimation method only has value for practical applications if it can finish in reasonable time. The three-step continuous estimation method (3SC) described in Section 4 has this property.In Table 3the computation time of 3SC is compared with the computation time of EM for different sample sizes. The results show that the computation time of the EM-algorithm increases drastically when the sample size increases, while the computation time of the 3SC-method does not. This is only for a small example with C = 20 rooms, so the results will be worse for practical instances. Fortunately, the 3SC-method can be used also for larger instances, with more capacity. In Table 4the computation time of 3SC is given for a hotel with C = 200 rooms for different sample sizes. The computation time increases but it stays reasonable.In the analysis of the cancellation model it was stated that the model suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The state space of the Markov decision process is too large, such that solving the exact problem takes too much time. In Table 5the computation times of the solution methods are presented for a small example, where C = 10, T = 20, l = 1, and the number of products n varies from 2 to 10. Evaluating instances with n > 6 using the exact solution method causes system to be out of memory and the exact solution can therefore not be computed.This example shows that when the number of products increases the computation time increases drastically, while the computation times for the heuristic stay more or less constant. In Table 6 below the computation times of the heuristics are presented for a larger instance, where C = 200, T = 1000, and n = 10. Even in this case the computation time is very small.The cancellation model is only useful if the tractable heuristics outperform the base model. To this end, consider a large instance, with C = 200 rooms and T = 1000 time periods. The load factors l that are considered are {0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4}. In Table 6 the results are presented.There are several noteworthy observations from Table 6. First and foremost, using the policies found by the IOC and LCR heuristics lead to solutions with higher revenue compared the TvR solution method (except for the case that l = 0.6, when LCR still outperforms TvR, but IOC is slightly outperformed by TvR). Therefore it is reasonable to consider cancellations in the decision making process. Taking cancellation into account leads to a revenue gain of up to 20 percent.Second, the IOC algorithm performs better than the TvR algorithm, but worse than the LCR algorithm. This is the motivation for choosing LCR over IOC if we work under the linear cancellation rates Assumption 2.2, but choosing IOC over TvR if we work with general probability rates under the independence of cancellations Assumption 2.1.Third, the effects of taking cancellations into account increase when the arrival volume increases. This is intuitively clear: if the arrival rate is higher, the gap caused by a cancelled reservation will be filled quickly. If you do not take cancellations into account, the gap caused by the cancelled reservation will not be filled, which implies a loss in revenue.Estimation errors potentially lead to bad performance of the optimisation model. Depending on the sample size the estimation error might be small or large. In the next simulation the performance of the solution method using estimated parameters is measured. Again a large instance is considered, where C = 200, T = 1000, and n = 10. The load factor l is given different values, namely {0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4}, to consider the effect of different demand volumes. For each load factor a dataset of size 100 (arrival days) is created, from which the parameters are estimated. The estimated parameters are used by all heuristics to find the corresponding policy and revenue. In Table 8 the results of the estimation are presented. The true values as well as the estimated values are presented.In Table 7the revenues corresponding to load factor l, heuristic, and estimated or true parameter set is given. From this table several observations can be made. Firstly, the heuristics outperforms the TvR method in all cases: for all load factors, for all parameter sets, true or estimated. This fact suggests that choosing a heuristic that takes cancellations into account is prefered over the TvR model, even if the parameters are estimated and thus contain errors.Second, the model using the estimated parameters might outperform the model with the true parameters, or it might not. It seems that in this instance the extreme load factors (l = 0.6 and 1.4) lead to a better performance of the model under estimated parameters for all heuristics, while with the other load factors the model under the true parameters performs better.
