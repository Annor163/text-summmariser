@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We demonstrate a great variability of single-pulse (with only one pulse/wave-packet traveling along the cavity) generation regimes in fiber lasers passively mode-locked by non-linear polarization evolution (NPE) effect. Combining extensive numerical modeling and experimental studies, we identify multiple very distinct lasing regimes with a rich variety of dynamic behavior and a remarkably broad spread of key parameters (by an order of magnitude and more) of the generated pulses. Such a broad range of variability of possible lasing regimes necessitates developing techniques for control/adjustment of such key pulse parameters as duration, radiation spectrum, and the shape of the auto-correlation function. From a practical view point, availability of pulses/wave-packets with such different characteristics from the same laser makes it imperative to develop variability-aware designs with control techniques and methods to select appropriate application-oriented regimes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Mode-locked fiber lasers are widely used as sources of ultra-short optical pulses [1–6]. The growing use of fiber lasers for this purpose is supported by customer demand for reliable femto- and pico-second lasers with a long (or, better, unlimited) operation lifetime and without any need for manual adjustments. Fiber lasers mode-locked due to non-linear polarization evolution (NPE) may satisfy these requirements [7,8] as they make direct use of their resonators’ non-linear properties and are able to generate pulses with durations as short as 50fs and even less [9,10]. Being at the same time a promising tool and a unique platform for observing spectacular non-linear optical interactions, NPE mode-locked fiber lasers attract much attention from both scientists and laser engineers. Such lasers support a large variety of generation regimes [11], including pulses of different shapes [12–15], multi-pulse lasing at different fundamental repetition frequency multiples [16], as well as complex soliton structures [14,16] and soliton rains [17]. In the present work, we limit our analysis to single-pulse lasing, that is, when only one laser pulse/wave-packet is present over a single round trip of the cavity. However, as our results show, even within such a limited case, a large variety of lasing regimes is found, which may considerably (up to an order of magnitude or even more) differ from each other in pulse energy, duration, bandwidth, etc., and may dramatically differ from each other in pulse structure being either “conventional” (single-scale) smooth pulses or double-scale pulses (wave-packets) with complex internal structure and phase fluctuations [18]. This has an important practical impact, calling for a variability-aware design of laser systems with embedded control techniques and methods to select appropriate output pulses.The setup used in our experiments is similar to those described in our previous studies [18–20], see Fig. 1. The fiber laser has a ring cavity with a wave-division-multiplexing (WDM) used to couple in the pump radiation. Either 2m-long Er- or 8m-long Yb-doped optical fiber is used in different experiments as the active medium, both of which produce qualitatively similar results at net-normal and all-normal cavity dispersion respectively. Either SMF-28 or normal-dispersion fiber (NDF) is used to elongate the cavity and thus increase pulse energy. Output laser radiation is extracted through a fiber polarization beam splitter (FPBS) or through an additional coupler inserted into the cavity. Mode-locked operation was achieved by adjusting fiber polarization controllers PC1, 2. Operation regimes were studied with the help of a fast oscilloscope, an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA), and an optical pulse auto-correlator.In order to investigate the variety of possible single-pulse lasing regimes and their properties, we used a well-established numerical model based on a set of modified, non-linear Schrödinger equations for orthogonal polarization components of the field envelope [21]:(1)∂Ax∂z=iγ|Ax|2Ax+23|Ay|2Ax+13Ay2Ax∗+g0/21+E/(Psat·τ)Ax-i2β2·∂2Ax∂t2(2)∂Ay∂z=iγ|Ay|2Ay+23|Ax|2Ay+13Ax2Ay∗+g0/21+E/(Psat·τ)Ay-i2β2·∂2Ay∂t2where Ax, and Ayare the orthogonal components of the field envelope, z is the longitudinal coordinate, t – time, γ=4.7×10−5 (cmW)−1, β2=23ps2/km – non-linear and dispersion coefficients, g0=540dB/km – unsaturated gain coefficient, Psat=52mW – saturation power for the active fiber. In order to accelerate simulations and spare computational resources, we reduced cavity length to 10m, which corresponds to cavity round-trip time τ=48ns. Similarly to [18,19], we integrated Eqs. (1) and (2) over 104 round-trips, using white noise as the initial condition for the first iteration. The term proportional to g0 describes saturated optical gain and therefore was omitted while simulating pulse propagation in a passive fiber. Polarization controllers were taken into account through applying unitary matrices. Eqs. (1) and (2) were integrated numerically using step-split Fourier method. We checked carefully that the main results of this paper were not influenced by variation of numerical integration step, step number, mesh width, and number of mesh points, provided that these parameters were chosen in proper limits.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Our simulation and experiments demonstrate considerable spread of pulse parameters generated by fiber lasers mode-locked due to NPE. This finding should encourage users to carefully control at least the duration and optical spectrum of laser pulses, since the pulse parameters may change considerably, for example, due to relaxation of stress introduced by fiber polarization controllers, equivalent to a change in PC settings. This is of primary importance in the case of long and ultra-long fiber lasers, which are characterized by substantial length of non-linear interactions, which lead to considerable amplification of perturbations and make such lasers highly prone to undesired irregular regime hops. Note also that NPE mode-locked fiber lasers are relatively sensitive to ambient conditions because fiber birefringence depends on temperature, mechanical stress, and so on. Uncontrollable fiber birefringence changes make it necessary to adjust polarization controllers in order to trigger mode-locked operation or to stabilize it. Adjustment, however, may lead to the start of a mode-locked regime substantially different from the one before the adjustment.Another important point of our study is that various lasing regimes should be carefully chosen in order to optimally meet the requirements of a particular laser application. Using second harmonic generation and Raman frequency conversion as a test bed, we have shown that different lasing regimes’ efficiency may vary considerably even if laser pulses generated in different regimes have similar energies and duration.The technological remedy (for example, in the form of control and adjustment elements) for the discussed output pulse characteristic variability should be incorporated into laser system designs.
