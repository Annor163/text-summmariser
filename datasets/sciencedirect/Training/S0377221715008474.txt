@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper deals with portfolio selection problems under risk and ambiguity. The investor may be ambiguous with respect to the set of states of nature and their probabilities. Both static and discrete or continuous time dynamic pricing models are included in the analysis. Risk and ambiguity are measured in general settings. The considered risk measures contain, as particular cases, the usual deviations and the coherent and expectation bounded measures of risk.Four contributions seem to be reached. Firstly, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are given. Secondly, the portfolio selection problem may be frequently solved by linear programming linked methods, despite the fact that risk and ambiguity cannot be given by linear expressions. Thirdly, if there is a market price of risk then there exists a benchmark that creates a robust capital market line when combined with the riskless asset. The global risk of every portfolio may be divided into systemic and specific. Moreover, if there is no ambiguity with respect to the states of nature (only their probabilities are uncertain), then classical CAPM-formulae may be found. Fourthly, some recent pathological findings for ambiguity-free analyses also apply in ambiguous frameworks. In particular, there may exist arbitrage free markets such that the ambiguous agent can guarantee every expected return with a maximum risk bounded from above by zero, i.e. , the capital market line (risk, return) becomes vertical. For instance, in the (non-ambiguous) Black and Scholes model this property holds for important risk measures such as the absolute deviation or the CVaR. Nevertheless, in ambiguous settings, adequate increments of the ambiguity level will allow us to recover capital market lines consistent with the empirical evidence. The introduction of ambiguity may overcome several caveats of many important pricing models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Most of the financial problems involving capital markets deal with probabilities of states of nature. Both the set of states of nature and their probabilities must be estimated and may incorporate measurement errors. The presence of ambiguity (or agents with multiple priors) is usual in economics and finance (Hansen & Sargent, 2012), and it affects many pricing and equilibrium problems, as well as investment decisions. Many recent papers are focusing on these issues. For instance, Riedel (2009) dealt with optimal stopping in an ambiguous framework, and Bossaerts, Ghirardato, Guarnaschelli, and Zame (2010) studied the impact of ambiguity and ambiguity aversion on equilibrium asset prices. With regard to portfolio selection problems, Garlappi, Uppal, and Wang (2007) dealt with ambiguous expected returns and empirically showed that, compared with portfolios from classical and Bayesian models, ambiguity aversion leads to optimal solutions that are more stable over time and deliver higher out-of sample Sharpe ratios. In this sense, the introduction of uncertainty may be more than realistic and could be also interesting to many traders.Every capital market problem must deal with a risk measurement method. The standard deviation has been the main risk measure due to its good analytical properties. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence, the fast evolution of capital markets, and the growing presence of asymmetric returns make it necessary the use of more complex measures of risk. Ogryczak and Ruszczynski (1999) have pointed out the lack of consistency between the standard deviation and the second order stochastic dominance if asymmetric returns are involved. Besides, in a non-Gaussian world the standard deviation is not perfectly correlated with potential capital losses, which is an important disadvantage with respect to other risk measures such as the value at risk (VaR). As a consequence, risk measurement beyond the variance has become very important in finance, as shown by the recent literature. For instance, Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, and Heath (1999) introduced the coherent measures of risk, Rockafellar, Uryasev, and Zabarankin (2006) defined the deviation measures and the expectation bounded risk measures, Zhiping and Wang (2008) defined the two-sided coherent risk measures, Brown and Sim (2009) defined the satisfying measures, and Bali, Cakici, and Chabi-Yo (2011) provided measures of riskiness.Many classical financial topics have been revisited using risk measures. With respect to portfolio choice problems, among many others, Zhiping and Wang (2008) presented very general analyses, and Bali et al. (2011) pointed out how the empirical results indicate that some generalized measures of riskiness are very appropriate to rank equity portfolios based on their expected returns per unit of risk. Nevertheless, Balbás, Balbás, and Balbás (2010) proved the existence of caveats affecting the most important arbitrage free pricing models of Financial Economics. For instance, for the Black and Scholes model, and for every coherent and expectation bounded measure of risk, investors can build portfolios with the intended expected return (as large as desired) and non-positive risk (equal to or lower than zero). This pathological finding also holds if one combines Black and Scholes with VaR, and it is not easily overcome if one incorporates “reasonable” transaction costs (Balbás, Balbás, & Balbás, 2013).Recent literature has also focused on robust portfolio choice with both ambiguity and general risk measures. In particular, Schied (2007) establishes duality linked optimality conditions, Zhu and Fukushima (2009) yield algorithms to minimize the worst-case (or robust) conditional value at risk (CVaR) if the set of priors satisfies some required assumptions, and Chen, He, and Zhang (2013), Scutellà and Recchia (2013) and Maillet, Tokpavi, and Vaucher (2015) deal with general asset allocation problems.This paper focuses on robust portfolio selection and attempts to address several open problems arising from the discussion above. Indeed, we will consider a general risk measure and an ambiguous framework and study three main problems: The existence of indices or benchmarks providing us with the set of optimal portfolios, extensions of the classical CAPM, and the caveat above of Balbás et al. (2010), and Balbás et al. (2013). This economic meaningless equality(risk,return)=(0,∞)will be called good deal in this paper.11The notion of good deal was introduced by Cochrane and Saa-Requejo (2000). Mainly, a good deal was an investment strategy providing traders with a “very high return/risk ratio” , in comparison with the Market Portfolio. Risk was measured with the standard deviation, and the absence of good deal was imposed so as to price in an incomplete arbitrage free model.In this paper we deal with alternative risk measures and identify the concept of good deal with a strategy yielding an infinite return/risk ratio.With respect to the ambiguity, we consider a very general case because it may affect both the set of states of nature and the probabilities of the states. Obviously, this framework contains more restricted approaches dealing with ambiguity with respect to volatilities, expected returns, covariances, etc.The paper’s outline is as follows. Section 2 is devoted to summarizing the basic notions and notations, as well as some background. The robust portfolio selection problem is introduced and studied in Sections 3 and 4. As usual in finance, ambiguity aversion is incorporated by dealing with the worst-case principle, as justified in Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989). Though there are alternative methods also consistent with the famous Ellsberg paradox, most of the authors adopt a worst-case approach; for instance, all of the ambiguity-linked papers cited above.Our portfolio choice problem minimizes the robust (worst-case) risk for every robust expected return. Though this is not a linear problem, we extend the approach of Balbás et al. (2010) in risk minimization so as to involve ambiguity too. Consequently, we find a dual problem that characterizes the primal solutions and may be analyzed with linear programming methods. This seems to be a good news because there are very efficient algorithms to solve linear problems in both finite and infinite-dimensional frameworks (Anderson & Nash, 1987). Theorems 3 and 4 are the most important results of Section 3, since they provide optimality conditions for both the robust portfolio selection problem and its dual. In Remark 3 we draw on the optimality conditions in order to address our three major objectives: The existence of robust good deals, the existence of appropriate benchmarks under the robust good deal absence, and the CAPM-like formulae. Four disjoint and complementary results may arise. Firstly, if the investor reflects a high level of uncertainty (the set of priors is large and contains the stochastic discount factor of the pricing model), then the market is risk neutral for this investor. This means that there are no worst-case expected returns higher than the risk-free rate, and therefore the investor has no incentives to buy risky assets. This result seems to be consistent with the theoretical and empirical findings of Cao, Wang, and Zhang (2005) and Bossaerts et al. (2010). Agents who are sufficiently ambiguity averse find open sets of prices for which they refuse to hold an ambiguous portfolio or choose not to participate in the stock market. Secondly, if the set of priors of the investor is lower, then he/she can find a benchmark that generates a robust capital market line (CML) when combined with the riskless security. This market line provides a robust market price of risk (the relationship between the worst-case expected return and the worst-case risk), as well as the systemic and specific robust risk of every asset. Furthermore, if there is no ambiguity with respect to the states of nature, and only their probabilities are uncertain, then for every available security (or portfolio) the investor may measure two “betas” (regression coefficients) with respect to the benchmark, which allow her/him to give lower and upper bounds for the worst-case expected return. This is an obvious extension of the classical CAPM formulae (Theorem 9) holding for ambiguous settings and expectation bounded risk measures or deviation measures. For efficient strategies both betas become identical, and so do the lower/upper bound above. Two numerical experiments involving the binomial pricing model and real market data, respectively, illustrate our findings of Sections 3 and 4, as well as the relevance of the presence of ambiguity.The third and fourth cases in Remark 3 lead to the existence of robust good deals. If the investor uncertainty is “too low” then the stochastic discount factor may be in the frontier or outside a set of linear envelopes of the risk measure. If it is in the frontier then the couple(robust_risk,robust_return)=(0,∞)is available to the trader, and we will say that there are robust good deals of the first type. If it is beyond the frontier then(robust_risk,robust_return)=(−∞,∞)is available, and there is a robust good deal of the second type.In Section 5 we attempt to overcome the presence good deals. The main result is Theorem 10. It shows that there is a very important difference between the ambiguous and the non-ambiguous setting. Under ambiguity, if we properly increment the set of priors, then the absence of good deal is guaranteed. Furthermore, the enlargement of the degree of ambiguity may be done in such a manner that the new robust capital market line and the new robust market price of risk may be as close as possible to those reflected by the empirical evidence of the investor. In this sense, the introduction of ambiguity may overcome several caveats of many important arbitrage free pricing models of Financial Economics, such as Black and Scholes, Heston, etc. By adding ambiguity these models stop reflecting the presence of good deal when risks are measured by coherent and expectation bounded risk measures. Two numerical experiments involving the binomial pricing model and real market data illustrate the most important findings of Section 5.The last section of the paper summarizes the most important conclusions, and the appendix contains the data associated with the empirical implementations.As usual in asset pricing, consider a probability space(Ω,F,IP0)composed of the set of states of nature Ω that may arise at a future date T, theσ−algebraFreflecting the information available at T, and the probability measureIP0.L2=L2(Ω,F,IP0)will represent the Hilbert space of random variables on(Ω,F,IP0)whose expectation and variance are finite, endowed with the usual inner product and norm.T⊂[0,T]is the set of trading dates and satisfies{0,T}⊂T,and(Ft)t∈Tis the filtration reflecting the arrival of information, whereF0={⊘,Ω}andFT=Fmust hold. A closed subspace Y ⊂ L2 will be composed of reachable pay-offs at T (or marketed claims) that may be replicated by means of self-financing portfolios adapted to(Ft)t∈T.Let us assume that the current priceπ(y)∈IRof every y ∈ Y is given by the market and known by the investor. The pricing ruleπ:Y→IRwill be linear and continuous. Moreover, we will assume that π may be extended in such a manner that one reaches a complete arbitrage free market, and therefore there exists a linear and continuous pricing ruleΠ:L2→IRsuch thatΠ(y)=π(y)for y ∈ Y, and Π is positive. Formally, we have:Assumption 1There exists an extensionΠ:L2→IRof the pricing ruleπ:Y→IR. Furthermore, Π is linear, continuous and positive.Assumption 1 obviously holds if the initial market is already complete (for instance, in the binomial or the Black and Scholes models), in which caseY=L2andΠ=π. Incomplete markets may satisfy the existence of Π as well. For example, if the set Ω only contains finitely many states then L2 becomes a finite-dimensional space, and the existence of Π holds if π is arbitrage free (Harrison & Kreps, 1979). If Ω contains infinitely many states then the existence of Π is also possible. For instance, though “formally” stochastic volatility models are incomplete, in practice it is assumed the existence of volatility dependent assets making them complete. Otherwise it would be impossible to use these models so as to give a unique price of the usual derivatives. Further details about the existence of Π under general conditions for Ω may be found in Luenberger (2001).HenceforthIEp(.)will denote mathematical expectation with respect to a probability measure p. As usual, we will assume the existence of a riskless rate rf≥ 0 and a riskless assety=1(i.e., 1 ∈ Y) such that(1)π(1)=e−rfT.The Riesz Representation Theorem (Maurin, 1967) guarantees the existence of a unique y0 ∈ L2 such that(2)Π(y)=e−rfTIEIP0(y0y)for every y ∈ L2. Obviously,(3)IP0(y0>0)=1since otherwise Π would not be positive and would not generate an arbitrage free pricing rule.The orthogonal projection of L2 on Y will be denoted by φY, and the orthogonal complement of Y will be represented by Y⊥. If y ∈ L2 theny−φY(y)∈Y⊥which, along with 1 ∈ Y (the riskless asset is available to traders), lead toIEIP0(y−φY(y))=0,i.e.,(4)IEIP0(φY(y))=IEIP0(y)for every y ∈ L2.Consider(5)yπ=φY(y0)∈Y.yπis usually called the stochastic discount factor (Duffie, 1988) and is the unique element of Y satisfying(6)π(y)=e−rfTIEIP0(yπy)for every y ∈ Y (recall thatIEIP0((y0−φY(y0))y)=0becausey0−φY(y0)∈Y⊥). Obviously, (1), ( 2) and (6) imply thate−rfT=π(1)=e−rfTIEIP0(y0)=e−rfTIEIP0(yπ),and therefore(7)IEIP0(y0)=IEIP0(yπ)=1,which is also consistent with (4).Though prices on Y are given by the market, the probability measureIP0indicating the returns distribution must be estimated or given by a pricing model. In both casesIP0may contain errors, which generate the investor ambiguity. We will deal with an investor considering a set of priors containingIP0. We will also assume that every prior isIP0-continuous.22IP0-continuous priors may be also called absolutely continuous with respect toIP0.Moreover, in order to prevent some mathematical problems, we will impose Assumption 2 below.Assumption 2There exists a convex and weakly compact setK⊂L2such thatKcontains the zero variance random variabley=1(1∈K),IP0(f≥0)=1andIEIP0(f)=1for everyf∈K,and the set of priors is composed of theIP0-continuous probability measures p whose Radon–Nikodym derivativedpdIP0with respect toIP0belongs toK(dpdIP0∈K).Assumption 2 is general enough and contains many particular cases. For instance, due to the Alaoglu’s Theorem and the Hahn–Banach Theorem (Maurin, 1967), it holds ifKis the intersection of some closed intervals [S, R] ⊂ L2 and the subspace composed of those random variables whose expectation equals 1, i.e.,(8)K=K[S,R]={f∈L2;IEIP0(f)=1,S≤f≤R}where 0 ≤ S ≤ 1 ≤ R and S and R are two arbitrary random variables of L2.33Notice that inequalities between elements of L2 will hold if they holdIP0– almost surely.Firstly, ifS=1orR=1then the non-ambiguous (or uncertainty free) case will be included in our framework, becauseK[S,R]={1}will become a singleton, and the probabilities of the states of nature will be known and given byIP0. Secondly, if S ≠ 1 and R ≠ 1 thenIP0may be interpreted as an estimated probability measure containing possible errors, which makes the investor incorporate the “spread” S ≤ 1 ≤ R indicating the estimation accuracy (the accuracy increases asR−1≥0and1−S≥0decrease). Actually, for every potential state of nature ω ∈ Ω and every feasible probability measure p we have thatS(ω)dIP0(ω)≤dp(ω)≤R(ω)dIP0(ω),or, in other words, “the (unknown in an ambiguous framework) probability of ω is lying within the spread(S(ω)dIP0(ω),R(ω)dIP0(ω))” , and S(ω) and R(ω) give a lower and an upper bound of the relative committed error when estimating the probability of the state ω.In the particular case ofΩ={ω1,ω2,...,ωn}being finite, which often holds in static or discrete time approaches, ifIP0(ω)>0for every ω ∈ Ω (states with null probability have been eliminated) then Assumption 2 holds for every convex and closed subset ofP={(pj)j=1n∈IRn;∑j=1npj=1,pj≥0forj=1,2,...,n},i.e., for every convex and closed set of probability measures on Ω.Forf∈Kwe do not impose the constraintIP0(f>0)=1,so there might be states with null probability under some feasible priors. The investor ambiguity may be beyond the probabilities of the states of nature. He/she may also reflect ambiguity with respect to the set of states Ω.In practical situations there could be ambiguous investors whose set of priors could be non-convex or non-weakly compact. For mathematical reasons we have to impose both convexity and weak compactness. Otherwise the results of this paper would become false. Nevertheless, if a set of priorsKwere norm bounded, then Alaoglu’s Theorem and the Hahn–Banach Theorem would imply that its closed convex hullC¯o(K)would be weakly compact. Thus, the role ofKcould be plaid byC¯o(K),though we will not address this approach in order to simplify the mathematical exposition. IfC¯o(K)replacedKthen there would not be any essential modification of the worst-case risk and the worst-case expected return, since, as it will be seen, both risk and return have linear approximations (see Definition 1 and Theorems 1 and 2 below) and maximize/minimize in extreme points (which belong toK). A particular interesting case arises for a finite set of priorsK,since every finite set has a compact convex hull.Assumptions 1 and 2 imply that the ambiguous trader is not sure about the physical probabilities of the states on nature, but the risk neutral probabilities (and therefore prices) are clear enough. There may be two reasons. Firstly, the trader may be dealing with securities whose quotations are available and given by the market, though the probabilities of their final pay-off may contain estimation errors. Example 2 in Remark 7 and Example 4 in Remark 9 will illustrate this situation. Secondly, physical probabilities are usually estimated with historical data (Trolle & Schwartz, 2009), while risk neutral ones are often computed by calibration to market prices (Trolle & Schwartz, 2009). Assumptions 1 and 2 indicate that the trader is provided with a significant quantity of real quotations, and he/she can calibrate the pricing model. Historical data may reflect special frameworks which do not apply now. The evolution of macro-economic variables and markets is very dynamic, and it is not always guaranteed that past data will reflect the present framework. Example 1 (Remark 7) and Example 3 (Remark 9) are toy cases which may help to understand this case.Let us follow the approach of Artzner et al. (1999) and Rockafellar et al. (2006) in order to introduce risk functions. Thus, a risk measure will be a functionρ:L2⟶IRsuch that there exists a convex and weakly compact subset Δρof L2 with(9)ρ(y)=Max{−IEIP0(yz);z∈Δρ}for every y ∈ L2. If (9) holds then it may be proved that Δρis unique, and z ∈ Δρif and only if(10)−IEIP0(yz)≤ρ(y)for every y ∈ L2. Furthermore, (9) holds if and only if ρ is continuous, sub-additive (ρ(y1+y2)≤ρ(y1)+ρ(y2)for yi∈ L2,i=1,2) and positively homogeneous (ρ(λy)=λρ(y)for λ ≥ 0 and y ∈ L2). We will also impose ρ to beE˜ρ-translation invariant for someE˜ρ∈IR,E˜ρ≥0(ρ(y+k)=ρ(y)−E˜ρkifk∈IRand y ∈ L2), which is equivalent to the fulfillment of(11)IEIP0(z)=E˜ρfor every z ∈ Δρ. Finally, ρ will be(K,E˜ρ)-mean dominating (ρ(y)≥−E˜ρIEp(y)for every y ∈ L2 and every probability p such thatdpdIP0∈K,or, equivalently,44Recall thatf=dpdIP0implies thatIEp(y)=IEIP0(yf).ρ(y)≥−E˜ρIEIP0(fy)for every y ∈ L2 and everyf∈K) which holds if and only ifE˜ρKis included in Δρ. Summarizing, we have the following definition.Definition 1LetE˜ρ≥0be a non-negative real number.ρ:L2⟶IRis said to be a(K,E˜ρ)-expectation bounded risk measure if the two equivalent conditions below hold;(a)ρ:L2⟶IRis norm-continuous,E˜ρ-translation invariant,(K,E˜ρ)-mean dominating, sub-additive and positively homogeneous.There exists a convex and weakly compact set Δρ⊂ L2 such that(12)E˜ρK={E˜ρf;f∈K}⊂Δρ,(9) holds for every y ∈ L2 and (11) holds for every z ∈ Δρ.We will not prove the equivalence between Conditions (a) and (b) above because analogous proofs may be found in several papers (Balbás et al., 2013).In the ambiguity free caseK={1}there are many risk measures. Actually, every expectation bounded risk measure and every deviation measure (Rockafellar et al., 2006) satisfy Definition 1(b) above withE˜ρ=1andE˜ρ=0,respectively. Similarly, many coherent risk measures of Artzner et al. (1999) also satisfy Definition 1 withE˜ρ=1.As said in the introduction, the Ellsberg paradox indicates the presence of ambiguity aversion, which may be incorporated by dealing with the worst-case principle (Gilboa & Schmeidler, 1989). A consistent way to consider this principle is to define “the robust extension of a risk measure relative to the set of priorsK” . For instance, the robust CVaR with confidence level 0 ≤ μ < 1 relative to the set of priorsKwill be given by(13)RCVaR(K,μ)(y):=Max{CVaR(p,μ)(y);dpdIP0∈K}for every y ∈ L2, CVaR(p, μ)(y) denoting the usual CVaR of y if p is the selected probability measure and μ is the level of confidence. Though there are very interesting alternative definitions of the robust CVaR (Lagos, Espinoza, Moreno, & Vielma, 2015; Zhu & Fukushima, 2009), we have selected the version (13) of Balbás, Balbás, Balbás, and Heras (2015) because it properly fits the framework of this paper, as justified by Theorem 1 below whose proof, under minor modifications, may be found in this reference.Theorem 1Suppose that 0 ≤ μ < 1. Suppose that there exists R ∈ L2such that f ≤ R for everyf∈K. Then,CVaR(p,μ)(y)∈IRexists for every p withdpdIP0∈Kand every y ∈ L2, the maximum in(13)exists for every y ∈ L2, andRCVaR(K,μ)satisfies Definition1withE˜RCVaR(K,μ)=1and(14)ΔRCVaR(K,μ)={z∈L2;IEIP0(z)=1and∃f∈Kwith0≤z≤f1−μ}.In particular,K⊂ΔRCVaR(K,μ), and(9)and(14)imply thatRCVaR(K,μ)(y)is the optimal value of problemRCVaR(K,μ)(y)={Max−IEIP0(yz)IEIP0(f)=1,IEIP0(z)=10≤z≤f1−μz∈L2andf∈K⊂L2aredecisionvariablesfor every y ∈ L2.Similarly, one can define a robust extension relative toKof many coherent or expectation bounded risk measures, such as the weighted CVaR (Rockafellar et al., 2006). All of them will satisfy Definition 1 withE˜ρ=1. Robust deviations satisfyingE˜ρ=0may be also defined under adequate assumptions. For instance, the robust absolute deviation and the robust standard deviation could be given by(15)RADK(y):=Max{IEp(|y−IEp(y)|);dpdIP0∈K},andRSDK(y):=Max{IEp((y−IEp(y))2);dpdIP0∈K},respectively. The absolute deviation is consistent with the usual utility functions, but the standard deviation only satisfies this property for symmetric returns (Ogryczak & Ruszczynski, 1999). Since symmetric returns are difficult to find under ambiguity, let us focus on the absolute deviation and adapt Theorem 1 to this dispersion measure. The proof is similar to that of Theorem 1, and therefore it will be omitted.Theorem 2Suppose that there exists R ∈ L2such that f ≤ R for everyf∈K. Then,IEp(y)andIEp(|y−IEp(y)|)∈IRexist for every p withdpdIP0∈Kand every y ∈ L2, the maximum in(15)exists for every y ∈ L2, andRADK(y)satisfiesDefinition 1ifE˜RADK=0andΔRADKis the closed convex hull of{IEIP0(z)f−z∈L2;f∈K,z∈L2,−f≤z≤f}.In particular,0∈ΔRADK, and (9) implies thatRADK(y)={MaxIEIP0(y(z−IEIP0(z)f))IEIP0(f)=1−f≤z≤fz∈L2andf∈K⊂L2aredecisionvariablesfor every y ∈ L2.Let us end this section with a brief discussion about two relevant points affecting Definition 1. Firstly, perhaps one could think that it is not easy to identify the borderline between risk and uncertainty. In this sense, one could consider thatKand Δρcould be identical, since they could be representing similar notions. Let us indicate thatK=Δρis a particular case included in Definition 1 (forE˜ρ=1,see (12)), though we have preferred to deal with more general cases and give Definition 1 as it is. Anyway, we recognize that the economic literature did not solve the relationships/differences between risk and uncertainty yet, and further discussions will be expected in the near future. Secondly, there are alternative uncertainty/risk measures which are not expectation bounded, and therefore they do not satisfy Definition 1. Interesting examples are, for instance, those measures related to the notion of entropy (see Kullback and Leibler (1951), for information-linked studies, or Kupper and Schachermayer (2009), for risk-linked ones). Many results of this paper may be extended to more general frameworks, but not them all. Therefore, further research about portfolio selection under risk and uncertainty will be required in the near future too.Consider a(K,E˜ρ)-expectation bounded risk measure ρ. Consider also the robust portfolio choice problem(16)Minρ(y),{IEIP0(yπy)≤erfTIEIP0(yf)≥r,∀f∈Ky∈Yy being the decision variable. The ambiguous agent is minimizing the robust risk in the set Y of attainable pay-offs whose price is not higher than one dollar (first constraint) and whose expected return will be at least r regardless of the real probability that explains the market behavior (second constraint). Thus, the solution y* of (16) will guarantee (at least) the robust (or worst-case) expected return r, and a real risk never higher than ρ(y*). In this sense, the uncertainty (or ambiguity) does not impede guaranteeing a lower bound for the expected return with an upper bound for the global risk. We will assume that the investor desires at least the return of the riskless asset, sor≥erfTmust hold.Similarly to Balbás et al. (2010) or Balbás et al. (2013), and bearing in mind (9), if we add a new decision variableθ∈IRthen we obtain the equivalent problemMinθ,{θ+IEIP0(yz)≥0,∀z∈ΔρIEIP0(yπy)≤erfTIEIP0(yf)≥r,∀f∈Kθ∈IR,y∈Ywhose dual is(17)Max−λerfT+Λr,{φY(z+Λf)=λyπf∈K,z∈Δρ,λ,Λ≥0f∈K,z ∈ Δρandλ,Λ∈IRbeing decision variables. Computing expectations in the first constraint of (17), and taking into account Assumption 2, and Eqs. (4), (7) and ( 11), we getE˜ρ+Λ=λ,which leads toΛ=λ−E˜ρ,and the dual problem (17) simplifies to(18)Maxλ(r−erfT)−E˜ρr,{φY(z+(λ−E˜ρ)f)=λyπf∈K,z∈Δρ,λ≥E˜ρNext, let us give necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing that (16) is frequently feasible, unless the set of priors is closely related to the stochastic discount factor. Further interpretations will be given in Remark 3.Theorem 3(a)Suppose that the robust portfolio selection problem(16)is feasible for somer0>erfT. Then, for everyr>erfTthere exists y ∈ Y such thatIEIP0(yπy)<erfTandIEIP0(yf)>rfor every feasible priorf∈K. In particular,(16)is also feasible if r replaces r0.The robust portfolio selection problem(16)is feasible for everyr>erfTif and only ifyπ∉φY(K).(a) There exists a portfolio y1 ∈ Y such that π(y1) ≤ 1 andIEIP0(y1f)>erfTfor everyf∈K. SinceKis weakly compact, consider βy1 such that 0 < β < 1, βπ(y1) < 1 andβIEIP0(y1f)>erfTfor everyf∈K. For every α > 0 we have thatπ((1+α)βy1−αerfT)=(1+α)π(βy1)−α=π(βy1)+α(π(βy1)−1)≤π(βy1)<1,and, according to Assumption 2,IEIP0(((1+α)βy1−αerfT)f)=(1+α)βIEIP0(y1f)−αerfT⟶∞asα⟶∞. Thus, the weak compactness ofKimplies that(1+α)βy1−αerfTis a portfolio satisfying the first and second constraints in (16) as strict inequalities.(b) Suppose thatyπ∈φY(K). Takef∈Kwithyπ=φY(f). SinceφY(f)−f∈Y⊥,IEIP0((φY(f)−f)y)=0for every y ∈ Y. Hence,IEIP0(yπy)=EIP0(φY(f)y)=EIP0(fy),and the first and second constraints of (16) are not compatible.Conversely, suppose thatyπ∉φY(K). Since yπ∈ Y andφY(K)⊂Yis obviously weakly convex and compact, the Hahn–Banach separation theorem (Luenberger, 1969) implies the existence of y1 ∈ Y such thatIEIP0(yπy1)<Min{IEIP0(y1y);y∈φY(K)}. Bearing in mind that y1 ∈ Y andy−φY(y)∈Y⊥for everyy∈K,we have that(19)IEIP0(yπy1)<Min{IEIP0(y1y);y∈K}.We can also assume thatIEIP0(yπy1)>0because otherwise y1 could be substituted byy1+αwithα∈IRlarge enough, and we have thatIEIP0(yπ(y1+α))=IEIP0(yπy1)+αandIEIP0((y1+α)y)=IEIP0(y1y)+αIEIP0(y)=IEIP0(y1y)+α(see Assumption 2). Thus, consideringerfTy1IEIP0(yπy1)if necessary, we can assume thatIEIP0(yπy1)=erfT. Then, (19) implies that (16) is feasible for every r lying within the spread(IEIP0(yπy1),Min{IEIP0(y1y);y∈φY(K)}),and Theorem 3(a) implies that (16) is feasible for everyr>erfT.□Due to the fulfillmentIEIP0(yπy)<erfTandIEIP0(yf)>rfor every feasible priorf∈K,and proceeding as in Balbás et al. (2010) or Balbás et al. (2013), there is no duality gap between (16) and (18). In particular, we have the following theorem.Theorem 4Suppose that the robust portfolio selection problem(16)is feasible.(16)is bounded if and only if the dual problem(18)is feasible, in which case the following conditions hold:(a)The infimum of(16)equals the (attainable) maximum of(18).y* ∈ Y and (f*, z*, λ*)(18)-feasible solve(16)and(18)if and only if the following Karush–Kuhn–Tucker-like conditions(20){IEIP0(y*z)≥IEIP0(y*z*),∀z∈Δρ(λ*−E˜ρ)(IEIP0(y*f*)−r)=0λ*(IEIP0(yπy)−erfT)=0hold.The feasible set of (18) does not depend on r, and problem(21)Maxλ,{φY(z+(λ−E˜ρ)f)=λyπf∈K,z∈Δρ,λ≥E˜ρprovides us with the optimal dual solution (f*, z*, λ*) for everyr>erfT.There are very interesting algorithms permitting us to solve linear optimization problems in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings (Anderson & Nash, 1987). Though (21) is not linear because the constraint contains the product λf of two variables, under adequate conditions forKand ρ it becomes linear if one fixesλ=λ1∈IRand then deals with the resulting problem (21-λ1) involving only the decision variables (f, z). The existence of feasible solutions (f, z) for (21-λ1) is easy to verify. Indeed, since ( 21-λ1) is linear it has a linear dual (Anderson & Nash, 1987), and, under weak conditions, (21-λ1) is feasible if and only if its dual is bounded. If so, λ1 is not the optimal value of (21), so we must select an increment α > 0 and takeλ2=λ1+α. Now we can iterate the method, (21-λ2) can play the role of (21-λ1) and a good approximation of the solution (f*, z*, λ*) of (21) will be found in a finite number of steps. Once (f*, z*, λ*) is known, the solution y* of (16) may be found by linear programming methods, as shown in Corollary 5 below.If y* ∈ Y and (f*, z*, λ*) solve(16)and(21)then y* ∈ Y solves the linear optimization problem(22)Min−IEIP0(z*y),{IEIP0(yπy)≤erfT,IEIP0(f*y)≥ry∈Yy ∈ Y being the decision variable.According to Anderson and Nash (1987), the dual problem of (22) is(23)Max−erfTw1+rw2,{φY(z*+w2f*)=w1yπw1≥0,w2≥0w1∈IR,w2∈IRbeing the decision variables. Furthermore, if y is (22)-feasible and (w1, w2) is (23)-feasible then they solve the corresponding problem if they satisfy the complementary slackness conditions(24){w1(IEIP0(yπy)−erfT)=0w2(IEIP0(f*y)−r)=0Bearing in mind that y* and (f*, z*, λ*) are (16)-feasible and (21)-feasible and satisfy (20), it is straightforward to verify that y* and(w1=λ*,w2=λ*−E˜ρ)are (22)-feasible and (23)-feasible and satisfy (24).□Theorems 3 and 4 will allow us to consider four disjoint and complementary situations, which depend on the relative position between the pay-offs yπandE˜ρyπand the setsKand Δρ. Example 1 (see Remark 7) below will present a simple binomial pricing model illustrating that the four situations are feasible in practice.H1.yπ∈φY(K): In such a case (16) is not feasible ifr>erfT(Theorem 3). We will say that the market isK−risk-neutral. Besides, there existsf∈Kwithyπ=φY(f),andz=E˜ρf∈Δρowing to (12). Thus, (f, z, λ) is obviously (18)-feasible and (21)-feasible for everyλ≥E˜ρ,and both problems are feasible and unbounded. We will say that theK-capital market line (K-CML) is horizontal, i.e., the robust expected return equalserfTand does not depend on the portfolio risk.Case H2A:yπ∉φY(K)and Case H2B:E˜ρyπ∈φY(Δρ): In such a case (16) is feasible (Theorem 3(b)) , and bearing in mind thatφY(z+(λ−E˜ρ)f)=λyπfor z ∈ Δρsuch thatE˜ρyπ=φY(z),λ=E˜ρ,and everyf∈K,(18) and (21) are also feasible. Theorem 4 shows that (18) and (21) attain a maximum value. Let λ* be the maximum value of (21), and let us distinguish two disjoint situations. Ifλ*>E˜ρthen we will say that Case H2A holds. Taking into account the objective function of (18), the optimal robust risk is(25)ρ=λ*(r−erfT)−E˜ρr,or, equivalently,(26)r=ρ+λ*erfTλ*−E˜ρyields the relationship between the optimal robust risk and the guaranteed (or robust) expected return. We will say that(27)M=1λ*−E˜ρis the robust market price of risk for the investor whose ambiguity is given by the set of priorsK,and (26) will be called theK-capital market line (K-CML).Ifλ*=E˜ρthen we will say that Case H2B holds. Eqs. (16), (18) and (21) are feasible, but now the objective function of (18) implies that the optimal robust risk satisfiesρ=λ*(r−erfT)−E˜ρr=E˜ρ(r−erfT)−E˜ρr=−E˜ρerfTand it does not depend on r. In fact, one can construct sequences of portfolios whose robust expected return is as large as desired (tends to+∞) whereas their risk is as close to−E˜ρerfTas desired. There is no market price of risk because every guaranteed expected return is reached with a similar risk level. TheK-CMLis vertical, and we will say that there are(K,ρ)-good deals of the first type.E˜ρyπ∉φY(Δρ): Then, it is easy to see thatE˜ρ>0andyπ∉φY(K). Indeed, ifE˜ρ=0thenE˜ρyπ=0∈φY(Δρ)due to (12), and we contradict the assumption. Moreover,yπ∈φY(K)would implyE˜ρyπ∈φY(E˜ρK)⊂φY(Δρ),and once again we contradict the assumption.Sinceyπ∉φY(K)Theorem 3(b) implies that (16) is feasible. Suppose for a few moments that (16) is unbounded for everyr>erfT. Then, one can construct a sequence of portfolios guaranteeing an expected return as large as desired (tends to+∞) and whose robust risk is as negative as desired (tends to−∞). We will say that there are(K,ρ)-good deals of the second type.In order to show that (16) is unbounded, let us first assume thatE˜ρ=1. The constraintsφY(z+(λ−1)f)=λyπand λ ≥ 1 of (21) cannot hold, because we would have1λφY(z)+(1−1λ)φY(f)=φY(1λz+(1−1λ)f)=yπ,and yπwould belong to φY(Δρ) because this set is convex and yπwould be a linear convex combination of φY(z) ∈ φY(Δρ) andφY(f)∈φY(K)⊂φY(Δρ)owing to (12). Thus, (21) is not feasible and Theorem 4 implies that (16) is unbounded.IfE˜ρ≠1then we can replace ρ byρE˜ρbecauseE˜ρ>0. It is easy to see thatρE˜ρsatisfies Definition 1(a) and therefore it is a(K,1)-expectation bounded risk measure. Consequently, (16) is unbounded forρE˜ρand therefore it is unbounded for ρ too.Case H2A above is the natural situation, since (16) and (18) are feasible and bounded,λ*>E˜ρ,1λ*−E˜ρis the market price of risk, and theK-CMLof (25) and (26) give the relationship between the optimal robust risk and its associated robust expected return. Nevertheless, the existence of good deals of the first (H2B) or second (H3) type frequently holds. For instance, in the non-ambiguous case, Balbás et al. (2010) have proved that the Black and Scholes model generates good deals for every coherent and expectation bounded risk measure and for the absolute deviation. Moreover, if the selected risk measure is the CVaR then this pricing model generates good deals of the second type (H3). This caveat also applies for many stochastic volatility pricing models.We will devote this section to dealing with Case H2A. Accordingly, throughout this section (f*, z*, λ*) will be a solution of (21) such thatλ*>E˜ρ≥0. Fixr*>erfTand consider the corresponding primal solution y*. Obviously, y* is a priced one portfolio due to (6) and the third condition in (20 ). We will see that y* may be understood as a benchmark, in the sense that the efficient strategies will be combinations of y* and the riskless asset. Since the framework we are dealing with is very general, it is not possible to give a general distribution of y*, as it will be pointed out in Remark 7 and Example 1 below.Proposition 6 and Remark 5 below are very similar to parallel findings of Balbás et al. (2010) for the ambiguity free case, but we will include their proofs in our new context.Proposition 6Ifr>erfTreplaces r*then the primal solution becomes the combination of the riskless asset and y*given byαy*+(1−α)erfTwithα=r−erfTr*−erfT.It is sufficient to see thatαy*+(1−α)erfTand (f*, z*, λ*) satisfy (20). With respect to the first inequality of (20), for z ∈ Δρwe have that (see (11))IEIP0(z(αy*+(1−α)erfT))=αIEIP0(zy*)+(1−α)erfTE˜ρ≥αIEIP0(z*y*)+(1−α)erfTE˜ρ=IEIP0(z*(αy*+(1−α)erfT)).The second condition in (20) andλ*>E˜ρlead toIEIP0(y*f*)=r*. Then (see Assumption 2),IEIP0(f*(r−erfTr*−erfTy*+r*−rr*−erfTerfT))=r−erfTr*−erfTIEIP0(f*y*)+r*−rr*−erfTerfTIEIP0(f*)=r−erfTr*−erfTr*+r*−rr*−erfTerfT=r.Bearing in mind (7), the third condition in (20) isIEIP0(yπ(αy*+(1−α)erfT))=αIEIP0(yπy*)+(1−α)erfTIEIP0(yπ)=erfT.Finally, sinceIEIP0(y*f)≥r*for everyf∈K,we have thatIEIP0((αy*+(1−α)erfT)f)≥αr*+(1−α)erfT=r−erfTr*−erfTr*+r*−rr*−erfTerfT=rfor everyf∈K.□Henceforth we will consider the benchmark y* generating the set of efficient portfolios by combinations with the riskless asset. As said above, (20) and the constraints of (16) imply that y* is a priced one strategy whose robust expected return is r*. According to the latter proposition and its proof, for everyr>erfT(28)r−erfTr*−erfTy*+r*−rr*−erfTerfTis a priced one efficient strategy whose robust expected return is r.For a general priced one portfolio y we will consider its robust expected return(29)IEK(y):=Min{IEIP0(yf);f∈K}and its robust risk ρ(y). Notice that the minimum in (29) is reached due to the Weierstrass Theorem and the weak compactness ofK. IfIEK(y)=r>erfTthen one obviously has thatρ(y)≥ρ(r−erfTr*−erfTy*+r*−rr*−erfTerfT).Since ρ isE˜ρ-translation invariant and homogeneous we have that(30)ρ(y)≥r−erfTr*−erfTρ(y*)+r−r*r*−erfTE˜ρerfT,i.e., the risk of y is never lower than the risk of the efficient portfolio (28) with the same guaranteed return as y. The right hand side in (30) will be said to be the systemic risk of y, while(31)ρ(y)−r−erfTr*−erfTρ(y*)−r−r*r*−erfTerfT≥0will be said to be its specific risk. Obviously, the inequality in (30) shows that “the market does not pay anything” for the specific risk, since the efficient portfolio of Proposition 6 guarantees the same robust return r and it only reflects the systemic risk of y.The remark above shows that y* describes the set of efficient strategies and yields the proportion of the risk of every portfolio that is related to its robust return. Next, let us see that some kind of “beta” between an arbitrary portfolio y and the benchmark y* may explain the worst-case return guaranteed by y. The interest of such a result is clear, and it is very appreciated in the financial literature. In fact, many papers analyze the existence of extensions of the classical CAPM-formulae for non-ambiguous settings and general risk measures. For instance, among many others, Balbás et al. (2010) find extensions for coherent risk measures and expectation bounded risk measures, while Zabarankin, Pavlikov, and Uryasev (2014) deal with risk measures related to the drawdown function.Lemma 7Suppose that there exist c,C∈IRsuch that 0 < c ≤ f ≤ C for everyf∈K.55Notice that this condition holds in the ambiguity-free case, sinceK={1}. Notice that this condition also holds forK=K[S,R](see(8)) if 0 < c ≤ S and R ≤ C.Considerf∈Kand denote by L2(f) the usual Hilbert space composed of the random variables with finite expectation and variance with respect to the probability measure p such thatf=dpdIP0. Then,L2(f)=L2,and the natural norms of L2∥u∥2=(∫Ωu2dIP0)12and L2(f)∥u∥(2,f)=(∫Ωu2fdIP0)12are equivalent (i.e., they generate the same topology).The result trivially follows fromc(∫Ωu2dIP0)12≤(∫Ωu2fdIP0)12≤C(∫Ωu2dIP0)12and the classical characterizations of equivalence between norms (Maurin, 1967).□Suppose that there exist c,C∈IRsuch that 0 < c ≤ f ≤ C for everyf∈K. Considerr>erfT,the solution (f*, z*, λ*) of(21)and the probability measure p*such thatf*=dp*dIP0. Consider the portfolio choice problem(32)Minρ(y),{π(y)=IEIP0(yπy)≤erfTIEp*(y)=IEIP0(yf*)≥ry∈Y.y ∈ Y being the decision variable. Then,(32)satisfies the conditions of H2A.The feasible set of (32) contains the feasible one of (16), and therefore (32) is feasible, Its dual optimal value is strictly higher thanE˜ρbecause (f*, z*, λ*) is feasible for its dual problem. It only remains to see that ρ is a({1},E˜ρ)-expectation bounded risk measure if p* plays the role ofIP0,i.e., we must see the inclusion{E˜ρ}⊂{z/f*;z∈Δρ},which trivially follows fromE˜ρK⊂Δρand its obvious consequenceE˜ρf*∈Δρ.□If the existence of the bounds c and C above holds, then for everyf∈Kand every closed subspace V of L2 one can consider the orthogonal projection φ(V, f): L2 → V of L2 on V when L2 is endowed with the scalar product generated by the probability measure p such thatf=dpdIP0. In particular,φ(Y,1)=φY.Theorem 9CAPM-like formulaeSuppose that there exist c,C∈IRsuch that 0 < c ≤ f ≤ C for everyf∈K. Fixr*>erfT,let y*be a solution of(16)and let (f*, z*, λ*) withλ*>E˜ρbe a solution of(21). Let y ∈ Y be a priced one portfolio, and considerf∈Ksuch thatIEK(y)=IEIP0(yf). Denote byWf*the linear subspace of Y generated by the riskless asset (recall that 1 ∈ Y ) andφ(Y,f*)(y0/f*)(see(2)), and denote by Wf the linear subspace of Y generated by the riskless asset and φ(Y, f)(y0/f). Considery(π,f*)*=φ(Wf*,f*)(y*)andy(π,f)*=φ(Wf,f)(y*). Suppose finally that(32)satisfies H2A if f replaces f*. Then:(a)Ifβf(y)=IEIP0[(y(π,f)*−IEIP0(y(π,f)*f))yf]IEIP0[(y(π,f)*−IEIP0(y(π,f)*f))2f]is the regression coefficient between y andy(π,f)*for the scalar product of L2generated by the probability measuredp=fdIP0,βf(y) ≥ 0,βf*(y)=IEIP0[(y(π,f)*−IEIP0(y(π,f)*f*))yf*]IEIP0[(y(π,f)*−IEIP0(y(π,f)*f*))2f*]is the regression coefficient between y andy(π,f*)*for the scalar product of L2generated by the probability measuredp*=f*dIP0,andβf*(y)≥0then(33)βf(y)(IEK(y*)−erfT)≤IEK(y)−erfT≤βf*(y)(IEK(y*)−erfT).Iff=f*then(34)IEK(y)−erfT=βf*(y)(IEK(y*)−erfT).The equality also holds if y has negative Beta (i.e., ifβf(y)=βf*(y)<0).If y solves(16)forr=IEK(y)>erfT,thenf=f*and(34)holds.First of all let us see that βf(y) andβf*(y)are well defined because denominators do not vanish. Let us focus on βf(y) only, sinceβf*(y)may be similarly studied. Inequalities 0 < c ≤ f and0≤(y(π,f)*−IEIP0(y(π,f)*f))2show thatIEIP0[(y(π,f)*−IEIP0(y(π,f)*f))2f]=0would implyy(π,f)*=IEIP0(y(π,f)*f),i.e.,(35)φ(Wf,f)(y*)=y(π,f)*=IEp(y(π,f)*),where p satisfiesdp=fdIP0. Besides,y(π,f)*=φ(Wf,,f)(y*)implies thaty*−y(π,f)*is orthogonal to Wfin the scalar product induced by p. Thus, since Wfcontains the riskless asset (1 ∈ Wf),IEp(y*−y(π,f)*)=0,and (35) implies that(36)φ(Wf,f)(y*)=y(π,f)*=IEp(y*).Since y* ∈ Y andy0/f−φ(Y,f)(y0/f)is orthogonal to Y under the scalar product induced by p,(37)IEp(y*(y0/f))=IEp(y*φ(Y,f)(y0/f)).Since Wfis generated by {1, φ(Y, f)(y0/f)},y*−φ(Wf,f)(y*)is orthogonal to φ(Y, f)(y0/f) under the scalar product induced by p,(38)IEp(y*φ(Y,f)(y0/f))=IEp(φ(Wf,f)(y*)φ(Y,f)(y0/f)).y0/f−φ(Y,f)(y0/f)is orthogonal to 1 ∈ Y in the scalar product induced by p. Thus,(39)IEp(φ(Y,f)(y0/f))=IEp(y0/f)=IEIP0(y0)=1,(see (7)). Bearing in mind that y* is (16)-feasible, (36)–(39) imply thatlerfT≥IEIP0(y*y0)=IEp(y*(y0/f))=IEp(y*φ(Y,f)(y0/f))=IEp(φ(Wf,f)(y*)φ(Y,,f)(y0/f))=IEp(IEp(y*)φ(Y,f)(y0/f))=IEp(y*)IEp(φ(Y,f)(y0/f))=IEp(y*)≥r*,and we have a contradiction.(a)Since (32) satisfies H2A, the results of Balbás et al. (2010) for the non-ambiguous case imply thatIEp(y)−erfT=βf(y)(IEp(y*)−erfT).SinceIEp(y)=IEIP0(yf)=IEK(y)andIEp(y*)≥IEK(y*),we have thatIEK(y)−erfT≥βf(y)(IEK(y*)−erfT). Similarly, Lemma 8 and the results of Balbás et al. (2010) imply thatIEp*(y)−erfT=βf*(y)(IEp*(y*)−erfT)andIEp*(y)≥IEK(y),so it only remains to see thatIEp*(y*)=IEK(y*),i.e.,IEp*(y*)≤IEK(y*). SinceIEK(y*)≥r*is obvious (y* has to be (16)-feasible), we must proveIEp*(y*)=r*,which trivially follows from the second condition in (20) and the inequalityλ*>E˜ρ.The proof is totally similar if we bear in mind thatβf(y)=βf*(y).It is sufficient to see thatf=f*or, in other words, the minimum in (29) must be attained at f*. Since y solves (16) forr=IEK(y)>erfT,the second condition in (20) and the inequalityλ*>E˜ρimply thatIEp*(y)=r=IEK(y).□Notice that Theorem 9 above extends important results of previous literature. For instance, (34) becomes the CAPM-like formulae of Zabarankin et al. (2014) for non-ambiguous frameworks, efficient portfolios and risk measures related to the drawdown function. Similarly, in the non-ambiguous caseK={1},(34) holds and is the CAPM-like formulae of Balbás et al. (2010) for deviations and risk measures beyond the variance. In both particular cases (y is efficient or the investor is not ambiguous) we have the equalityf=f*,and therefore (34) holds. In general, the fulfillment of the equalityf=f*cannot be characterized, and (33) is the expression. Portfolio y and the benchmark y* do not have to be associated with the same “worst prior” with respect to the robust expectation (29).Let us consider two numerical examples illustrating the ideas of Sections 3 and 4, Example 1 is a toy pricing process related to the classical binomial model, and our only purpose is to clarify the main ideas of this paper. Example 2 is a static approach in the usual line of many classical applications of Operational Research and Optimization Theory in Portfolio Choice Problems.Consider a three dates (two periods) binomial model characterized by the tree below(40)↗16↗84↘4↘2↗↘1The set Ω is composed of four states on nature, namely, (u, u) (i.e., two growths), (u, d) (up and down), (d, u) (down and up) and (d, d) (two falls). If the riskless rate vanishes then it is known that the physical (i.e., the probability measureIP0) and the risk neutral (or implied) probabilities of this model are(41)StateofNature,(u,u)RiskNeutralProbability,1/9PhysicalProbabilityp2(u,d)(d,u)2/92/9p(1−p)p(1−p)(d,d)4/9(1−p)2where 0 < p < 1 is the physical probability of “up” in (40). Obviously, L2 may be identified withIR4(there are four states of nature), this model is complete (Y=IR4), and the second row of (41) leads to the pricing ruleΠ(y1,y2,y3,y4)=19(y1+2y2+2y3+4y4).This pricing rule may be also given byΠ(y1,y2,y3,y4)=p219p2y1+p(1−p)29p(1−p)y2+p(1−p)29p(1−p)y3+(1−p)249(1−p)2y4=IEIP0(19p2y1,29p(1−p)y2,29p(1−p)y3,49(1−p)2y4)which, along with the completeness of the model (φYis the identity map), (2), (5) and (6) lead toy0=yπ=(19p2,29p(1−p),29p(1−p),49(1−p)2).Consequently, if the selected risk measure is the CVaR with a confidence levelμ=0.95=95%(recall thatE˜ρ=1), bearing in mind (14), Problem (21) becomes(42)Maxλ,{z1+λ−1=19p2λz2+λ−1=29p(1−p)λz3+λ−1=29p(1−p)λz4+λ−1=49(1−p)2λp2z1+p(1−p)z2+p(1−p)z3+(1−p)2z4=1λ≥1,0≤zi≤20,i=1,2,3,4(λ, z1, z2, z3, z4) being the decision variable. This linear problem is easy to analyze by a standard simplex method. Depending on p, all the possibilities of Remark 3 may arise. In particular, forp=1/3(physical probabilities equal risk neutral ones) problem (42) becomes unbounded, which implies that H1 holds, i.e., (16) is unfeasible and expected returns higher than the riskless rate are not available. If 1/3 < p < 0.850928801 then (42) is feasible, bounded, and its optimal value is higher than one. Thus, H2A holds and there is positive and finite market price of risk. Ifp=0.850928801then (42) is feasible but its optimal value λ* equals one.λ*=1leads to the market price of risk (see (27))M=∞and the existence of good deals of the first type. Despite the fact that we are dealing with an arbitrage free pricing model, agents can construct a sequence of priced one strategies whose expected return tends to+∞and whoseCVaR95%remains constant and negative (H2B holds). Finally, for p > 0.850928801 (42) becomes unfeasible, and therefore (16) is unbounded. H3 holds and agents can construct a sequence of priced one strategies whose expected return tends to+∞and whoseCVaR95%tends to−∞.Similarly, if we assume that 0 < p ≤ 1/3 then all the possibilities of Remark 3 may arise again. Indeed, it is easy to see that H1 holds forp=1/3,H2A holds for 0.074536 < p < 1/3, H2B holds forp=0.074536,and H3 holds for 0 < p < 0.074536.Consider now that an ambiguous investor estimatesp=0.850928801and considers totally unrealistic an unbounded market price of riskM=∞. Suppose that this agent deals with the set of priorsK=K[S,R](see (8)) withS=0andR=3(i.e., the third row of (41) could contain an estimation error up to 200%). Then the robustRCVaR(K,95%)of (13) will be the risk measure, and problem (21) will becomeMaxλ,{z1+(λ−1)f1=19p2λz2+(λ−1)f2=29p(1−p)λz3+(λ−1)f3=29p(1−p)λz4+(λ−1)f4=49(1−p)2λp2z1+p(1−p)z2+p(1−p)z3+(1−p)2z4=1p2f1+p(1−p)f2+p(1−p)f3+(1−p)2f4=1λ≥1,0≤zi≤20fi≤60,i=1,2,3,4(λ, z1, z2, z3, z4, f1, f2, f3, f4) being the decision variable. This problem is “almost” linear and may be easily solved by a simplex method jointly with the algorithm of Remark 2.66There are other recent methods allowing us to solve quite general robust optimization problems (Goberna, Jeyakumar, Li, and Rez, 2015, among others).The numerical solution is(λ*,z1*,z2*,z3*,z4*,f1*,f2*,f3*,f4*)=(2.4705,0,0,0,44.99849967,0.257773419,2.943203883,2.943203883,3).This solution leads to the “worst case probabilities for the robust expectation” (see (29) and recall that for a finite set Ω the equalityf=dpdIP0implies thatfi=pi/IP0,i,i=1,2,3,4)(0.186648532,0.373342401,0.373342401,0.066666667).More importantly,λ*=2.4705implies a robust market price of riskM=1/1.4705≈0.68,much more acceptable than the non-ambiguous oneM=∞. Thus, the introduction of ambiguity may solve the caveats related to cases H2B and H3 and leads to much more realistic market prices of risk. In particular, the ambiguous investor reaches more acceptable prices of risk because the estimationp=0.850928801may contain significant errors.We have empirically tested the findings above by dealing with biweekly data related to five future markets. The database is provided in the appendix, and it involves the quotations of three international stock indices (S&P-500, EUROSTOXX-50 and DAX-30) and two commodities (Gold and Brent) in 2010. Since there are 27 quotations we have 26 biweekly returns, which are easily transformed into equivalent annual returns. Therefore, as usual, the set Ω of estimated states on nature is finite and contains 26 elements. Furthermore, in an ambiguity free framework we can assume that the probability of every scenario equals 1/26. In such a case, if the selected risk measure is the CVaR with confidence levelμ=90%,thenE˜ρ=1,K={1},and problem (21) becomes (see (14) and (21))Maxλ,{φY(z+(λ−1))=λyπIEIP0(z)=10≤z≤11−μ,λ≥1λ∈IRandz∈IR26aredecisionvariablesThis linear problem is easy to solve by a simplex method and generates the market price of riskM=1λ*−1=3.0816,i.e., for every couple (r, ρ) in the efficient line (26), if the selected risk (annualCVaR(pj=1/26,μ=90%)) ρ increased 1% and becameρ+0.01then the new expected annual return would increase 3.0816% and would becomer+0.0308.Suppose now that the investor thinks that 3.0816 is a too big market price of risk according to her/his empirical evidence. He/she may decide to introduce ambiguity in the probabilities of the sates. Suppose that every probability is distorted according to a measurement error up to 10%. In other words, suppose thatK=K[S,R](see (8)) with the constant functionsS(ωj)=0andR(ωj)=1.1,j=1,2,…,26. Then,K={(f1,…,f26);∑j=126fj=26,0≤fj≤1.1forj=1,…,26},and the set of selected probabilities will be(43){(p1,…,p26);∑j=126pj=1,0≤pj≤1.126forj=1,…,26}.Then (14) and (21) lead to problem(44)Maxλ,{φY(z+(λ−1)f)=λyπ∑j=126zj=26,∑j=126fj=260≤z≤f1−μ,0≤fj≤1.1forj=1,…,26,λ≥1λ∈IR,z∈IR26andf∈IR26aredecisionvariableswhich is almost linear and easy to solve with the methodology or Remark 2. Moreover, the robust (or ambiguous) market price of risk will becomeM=1λ*−1=1.94which may be much more realistic than 3.0816. The robust expected annual return (or the expected annual return guaranteed for every family of probabilities belonging to set (43)) will only increase 1.94% if the robust annualRCVaR(K,μ=90%)(or annualRCVaR(K,μ=90%)guaranteed for every family of admissible probabilities) increases 1%. Furthermore, the (worst case) solutionf*=(f1*,…,f26*)generates a probabilityp*=(p1*=f1*26,…,p26*=f26*26)with many components equaling 0.0423, which is 10% higher than 1/26 ≈ 0.0385. Similarly, the optimal portfolio y* solving (16) may be easily computed by linear programming methods (see Corollary 5), and it is significantly different if one compares the non-ambiguous case and the ambiguous one of (43). As indicated in the first paragraph of this section, it is not possible to give a general distribution of the benchmark y*. The obvious advantage of the ambiguous setting is given by the robustness of the conclusions for both optimal risk and optimal return.Finally, notice that one can measure the sensitivity of M with respect to the ambiguity level, given by the constraint fj≤ 1.1 of (44). Indeed, the Envelope Theorem of Optimization Theory Balbás, Galperin, and Guerra (2005) allows us to measure the sensitivity between M and every parameter of (44). Nevertheless, we will not address this topic because an alternative approach will be presented in Section 5, where a close relationship between the ambiguity level and the robust market price of risk will be established.Remark 3 leads to the existence of four disjoint and complementary scenarios. As stated in Theorem 9, the most natural one (H2A) implies some consequences quite parallel to those of the classical CAPM. Besides, H1 may be also natural. If the investor reflected high uncertainty, then it could be impossible to guarantee expected returns larger than the risk free rate (theK-CMLis horizontal, and the market price of risk vanishes). The absence of worst-case expected returns higher than the riskless rate may imply that the investor has no incentives to buy risky assets. This result is consistent with the theoretical and empirical findings of Cao et al. (2005) and Bossaerts et al. (2010): “Agents who are sufficiently ambiguity averse find open sets of prices for which they refuse to hold an ambiguous portfolio or choose not to participate in the stock market” .On the contrary, H2B or H3 implies the presence of good deals, which allow investors to construct portfolios whose robust expected return is as large as desired and whose robust risk is bounded from above (first type good deal, H2B) or as close to−∞as desired (second type good deal, H3). This pathological finding has been already pointed out by Balbás et al. (2010). These authors do not consider any sort of ambiguity but they show that very important pricing models (Black and Scholes, Heston, etc.) imply the presence of good deals for every coherent and expectation bounded risk measure. Moreover, the existence of good deals is not easily overcome if one considers transaction costs (Balbás et al., 2013). It seems to be a serious shortcoming non-compatible with any kind of equilibrium, since agents should try to create good deals to become as rich as intended, regardless of the risk measure they are dealing with. Those securities composing the good deal should be traded with the appropriate sign (long or short), and consequently, the evolution of prices would provoke the good deal elimination. The purpose of this section is to prove that increments of the degree of ambiguity may be useful to recover the absence of good deals.The presence of good deals indicates that the market price of risk is infinite. Since this should not be compatible with the equilibrium of capital markets, suppose that the empirical evidence provides the ambiguous investor with an estimation (or approximation) M of the real market price of risk, with0≤M<+∞(M is proportion between the increment of the optimal robust return and the increment of the optimal robust risk). Then, Theorem 10 below will show that adequate increments of the ambiguity level will lead to good deal free models whose market price of risk is “as close as possible” to M.Though more general analyses may be presented, in order to simplify the mathematical exposition we will assume thatK=K[S,R]is given by (8). More accurately, our new hypotheses are:Assumption 3The set of priorsK=K[S,R]is the subset of the interval [S, R] ⊂ L2given in(8). For every S*, R* ∈ L2with(45)0≤S*≤S≤1≤R≤R*there exists a(K[S*,R*],E˜ρ)-expectation bounded risk measureρK[S*,R*]such that:(a)ρK[S,R]=ρ.If 0 ≤ S** ≤ S* ≤ S ≤ 1 ≤ R ≤ R* ≤ R**thenρK[S*,R*](y)≤ρK[S**,R**](y)holds for everyy ∈ L2.Notice that Theorems 1 and 2 trivially imply the fulfillment of Assumption 3 ifρ=RCVaR(K[S,R],μ)orρ=RADK[S,R]. Indeed, it is sufficient to takeρK[S*,R*]=RCVaR(K[S*,R*],μ)andρK[S*,R*]=RADK[S*,R*], respectively.Expression (3) implies thatS0=S∧y0=Min{S(ω), y0(ω)} andR0=R∨y0=Max{R(ω), y0(ω)} satisfy (45), and therefore there existsρK[S0,R0]satisfying the properties of Assumption 3. For 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 consider problem (21-α), similar to problem (21) ifK[S,R]is replaced byK[Sα,Rα],where[Sα,Rα]=[αS+(1−α)S0,αR+(1−α)R0]and ρ is replaced byρK[Sα,Rα]. Denote byλα*≤∞the optimal value of (21-α), orλα*=−∞if (21-α) is not feasible. According to (27), consider the robust market price of riskMα=1λα*−E˜ρ,with the usual conventions1/0=∞and1/∞=0,and withMα=∞ifλα*=−∞.Theorem 10Suppose that there are(K[S,R],ρ)-good deals of the first or second type.(a)Function [0, 1]∋α → Mα∈ [0, ∞] is (non-necessarily strictly) increasing,M0=0andM1=∞.Given 0 ≤ M < ∞, the set composed of those α ∈ [0, 1) such that 0 ≤ Mα≤ M is non-void and has a supremum α0 ∈ [0, 1]. In particular,(16)becomes(K[Sα,Rα],ρK[Sα,Rα])-good deal free forα=0and for every α < α0, and the robust market price of risk Mα grows and remains lower than or equal to M asα→α0−.Obviously, S0 ≤ y0 ≤ R0 and (7) imply thaty0∈K[S0,R0]. Thus, Theorem 3 and (5) imply the fulfillment of H1 ifK[S,R]is replaced byK[S*,R*]andρ=ρK[S,R]is replaced byρK[S*,R*]. According to Remark 3 we have thatλ0*=∞,and thereforeM0=0.Inequalities S0 ≤ S and R ≤ R0 trivially imply that [Sα, Rα] decreases if α increases, and therefore so doesK[Sα,Rα]. Assumption 3 implies thatρK[Sα,Rα]decreases as α increases, and therefore (10) implies thatΔρK[Sα,Rα]also decreases as α increases. Thus, bearing in mind the feasible set of (21-α), it becomes obvious that[0,1]∋α→λα*∈[−∞,∞]is a (non-necessarily strictly) decreasing function. We have already shown thatλ0*=∞,while the existence of(K[S,R],ρ)-good deals shows thatλ1*=E˜ρorλ1*=−∞. Hence we can consider 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ 1 such thatλα*={∞,α∈[0,a)∞>λα*>E˜ρ,α∈(a,b)E˜ρ,α∈(b.c)−∞,α∈(c,1]where the last possibilityλ1*=−∞should be eliminated if the every(K[S,R],ρ)-good deal were of the first type. Consequently, under the conventions above1/0=∞,1/∞=0andMα=∞ifλα*=−∞,Mα=1λα*−E˜ρ={0,α∈[0,a)0<Mα<∞,α∈(a,b)∞,α∈(b,1]and [0, 1]∋α → Mα∈ [0, ∞] is a (non-necessarily strictly) increasing function withM0=0andM1=∞. Thus, sinceA={α;0≤Mα≤M}⊂[0,1]is non-void because 0 ∈ A, the result becomes obvious if one takesα0=Sup(A) .□Consider the non-ambiguous case and the Black and Scholes pricing model. As indicated in Remark 4, Balbás et al. (2010) have shown the existence of second type good deals if the selected risk measure is the CVaR, and the existence of first type good deals for the absolute deviation. Since Theorems 1 and 2 prove the existence of appropriate robust generalizations of both risk measures, Theorem 10 above shows that this caveat will be solved if we introduce ambiguity on the probabilities of the states of nature generated by this very important pricing model. Similar comments apply for more complex stochastic volatility pricing models (Heston model, for instance) and risk measures (spectral measures, Wang measure, etc.).Let us deal with the examples of Remark 7 in order to illustrate the implications of Theorem 10 in practice.Consider the market of Example 1. The non-ambiguous agent could reach the market price of riskM=∞(first type good deal), while the selected ambiguous one reachedM=0.68. The second value is more consistent with the economic intuition than the first one, but it might be “too small” . Suppose that the empirical estimation of a third ambiguous investor is that the market price of risk should be close toM=5. Then, according to Theorem 10, the non-ambiguous set of priorsK={1}may increase in such a manner that the robust market price of risk will be close to this empirical estimation. Actually, following the methods of Example 1, it is easy to see that forK=K[S,R]withS=0andR=1.2the solution of (21) becomes(λ*,z1*,z2*,z3*,z4*,f1*,f2*,f3*,f4*)=(1.1992,0,1.861799117,1.861795939,23.74495984,0.923790155,1.199984042,1.2,1.2)and the “worst case probabilities for the robust expectation” are(0.6688978130.1522167480.1522187720.026666667).The robust market price of risk becomesM=1/0.1992≈5.020080321,quite close to the desired target.Let us deal with the real market data of Example 2, but suppose that the confidence level isμ=52%. Notice thatCVaR(pj=1/26,μ=52%)is a coherent and expectation bounded measure of risk consistent with the second order stochastic dominance (Ogryczak & Ruszczynski, 2002), and the only difference with respect to the analysis in Example 2 is the considered tail. The investor of Example 2 measures the risk by checking the 10% most negative scenarios, while this percentage becomes 48% in the present study.If we fixpj=1/26,j=1,2,…,26,then the linear problem (21) is unbounded, which implies that there is a good deal of the second type (H3 holds). There are sequences of priced one strategies(ym)m=1∞such that(46)(CVaR(pj=1/26,μ=52%)(ym),Expectation(ym))⟶(−∞,+∞).This finding is obviously meaningless from a financial perspective, but Theorem 10 shows that this drawback can be overcome in an ambiguous framework. If we incorporate the ambiguity of Remark 7 given by (43), then we can solve (21) again (see Remark 2 ), but the problem still remains unbounded, so (46) still holds for more robust (risk, return) couples. A possible implication is that 10% may be a too small error when we estimate the real probabilities. Real committed errors may be much higher. Suppose that we enlarge the estimation error, which becomes 15%. Then (21) becomes bounded, but it leads to the huge market price of riskM=1λ*−1=15.632It might be still a meaningless situation in practice, so the increment adhoc of the initial measurement error 10% may be a wrong solution of the caveat. Thus, let us deal with Theorem 10 in a more profound manner. We can enlarge the estimation error so as to be as close as possible to the empirical evidence about the real robust market price of risk. In particular, if we assume thatM=1λ*−1=1.44is a reasonable value, then we have to take an estimation error equaling 60%. In other words, with these data, only high levels of ambiguity will lead to realistic values of the market price of risk. The clear advantage is the high robustness of the reached Robust Capital Market Line, since the new guaranteed risks and returns will apply for a very large set of priors.
