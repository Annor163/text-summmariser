BackgroundThere is an urgent need for objective criteria adjunctive to standard clinical assessment of acute Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Details of the development of a quantitative index to identify structural brain injury based on brain electrical activity will be described.MethodsAcute closed head injured and normal patients (n=1470) were recruited from 16 US Emergency Departments and evaluated using brain electrical activity (EEG) recorded from forehead electrodes. Patients had high GCS (median=15), and most presented with low suspicion of brain injury. Patients were divided into a CT positive (CT+) group and a group with CT negative findings or where CT scans were not ordered according to standard assessment (CT−/CT_NR). Three different classifier methodologies, Ensemble Harmony, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA), were utilized.ResultsSimilar performance accuracy was obtained for all three methodologies with an average sensitivity/specificity of 97.5%/59.5%, area under the curves (AUC) of 0.90 and average Negative Predictive Validity (NPV)>99%. Sensitivity was highest for CT+ cases with potentially life threatening hematomas, where two of three classifiers were 100%.ConclusionSimilar performance of these classifiers suggests that the optimal separation of the populations was obtained given the overlap of the underlying distributions of features of brain activity. High sensitivity to CT+ injuries (highest in hematomas) and specificity significantly higher than that obtained using ED guidelines for imaging, supports the enhanced clinical utility of this technology and suggests the potential role in the objective, rapid and more optimal triage of TBI patients.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for over 1.5 million emergency department (ED) visits annually within the United States and the majority of these visits are for mild injury (mTBI) [1]. The “Center for Disease Control” (CDC) additionally estimates that more than 2 million patients per year with nonfatal traumatic brain injury from sports and recreation activities do not seek medical care [2]. It is critical that medical providers at the scene of the injury and in the ED be able to rapidly and accurately determine if the traumatic brain injury is life or quality of life threatening. Currently, non-contrast cranial computed tomography (CT) scan is the method of choice for evaluating acute brain injury. In the ED departments of US hospitals, patients presenting with mTBI routinely undergo CT scans. This occurs primarily because of the high risk associated with missed intracranial lesions and because current decision rules for the use of CT scanning in mTBI have high sensitivity at the expense of very poor specificity [3].The emergency medicine, neurosurgical and neuroscience literature indicates that the prevalence of structural brain injury visible on CT (“CT positive”, CT+) in adult patients with mTBI and Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) [4] of 13–15, evaluated in the ED ranges from 7.5% to 12.1% [5–7]. Several factors related to the status of the patients at the time of evaluation are important determinants in the prevalence numbers reported. Furthermore, CT positive scans include a continuum of injuries from those that require little or no clinical intervention to those that are potentially life-threatening, with different clinical paths and actions required for the different levels of injury severity. As defined by Stiell et al. [8] “clinically important” brain lesions are those that require surgical intervention or observation in hospital whereas “clinically unimportant” brain lesions are those that require neither admission nor specialized follow-up.. This underscores the importance of rapid and reliable triage at the point of injury in TBI patients presenting to the ED with low suspicion of brain injury.Further complicating the situation is the fact that CT scans are assessed by subjective visual inspection, with poor inter-rater reliability, especially for etiology of the injury detected [9,10]. While some methods of scoring the severity of the abnormalities seen in CT have been used, these scales are largely insensitive to the type of injuries seen in patients who present with mild signs and symptoms, (e.g., Marshall Scale) [11]. Thus, there remains a need for more objective quantitative criteria as an adjunct to standard clinical and imaging practice to help optimize sensitivity to the “clinically important” brain injuries.Changes in brain electrical activity that occur in TBI have been reported in the scientific literature. The use of such measures for the classification and identification of head injured patients has also been studied using 19 lead electroencephalogram (EEG) data, and reported to be sensitive to both structural and functional brain injury [12–14]. This paper will describe the development of a hand-held tool using a classification algorithm based on quantitative features of brain electrical activity for rapid, objective, and reliable assessment of the likelihood of the presence of structural brain injury for the triage of patients who present with mild TBI to the ED. Throughout the period of development independent publications have presented evidence of the potential clinical utility of the classification algorithm in development [15–18].This paper will describe the development of a quantitative biomarker or index, based on brain electrical activity that is sensitive to the presence of structural brain injury. Embedded in a hand-held device, this system could be used to rapidly, objectively, reliably evaluate head injured patients presenting with low suspicion of brain injury. Specifically, the development and clinical utility of a binary classification algorithm, for classification into one of two distinct categories, will be described. This algorithm would assist in determining whether a patient is likely to have a CT positive brain injury and thereby aid in the determination of the presence of injuries requiring further clinical action.
