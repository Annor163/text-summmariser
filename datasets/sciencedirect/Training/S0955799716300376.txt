@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Radial basis function domain-type collocation method is applied for an elliptic partial differential equation with nonlocal multipoint boundary condition. A geometrically flexible meshless framework is suitable for imposing nonclassical boundary conditions which relate the values of unknown function on the boundary to its values at a discrete set of interior points. Some properties of the method are investigated by a numerical study of a test problem with the manufactured solution. Attention is mainly focused on the influence of nonlocal boundary condition. The standard collocation and least squares approaches are compared. In addition to its geometrical flexibility, the examined method seems to be less restrictive with respect to parameters of nonlocal conditions than, for example, methods based on finite differences.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Mathematical models arising in various fields of science and engineering (for example, thermoelasticity [1], thermodynamics [2], hydrodynamics [3], biological fluid dynamics [4] or plasma physics [5]) are very often expressed in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs) and nonclassical constraints, which are usually identified as nonlocal (boundary) conditions. As a rule, the appearance of nonlocal conditions makes quite a number of theoretical and numerical challenges. Therefore, nonlocal differential problems receive a lot of attention in the literature. Many studies are dedicated to various aspects of the numerical solution of such nonclassical problems.Finite differences, finite elements or finite volumes are examples of discretisation techniques which are widely and successfully applied to approximate solution of various PDEs. These traditional approaches are based on the domain discretisation using mesh. The mesh generation can be quite a difficult task in the case of three-dimensional domains with complex shapes. One of the ways to overcome problems related to the meshing are the so-called meshless methods, which gained a lot of attention in recent years (see e.g. [6–8]).In this paper, for the solution of a model problem with nonlocal boundary condition we apply a meshless discretisation technique based on the radial basis functions (RBFs) [9–14]. In papers [15–19], RBFs were already used for the spatial discretisation of time dependent (parabolic and hyperbolic) equations with nonlocal integral conditions. Experiments with various test examples have demonstrated that RBF-based collocation methods can be successfully applied to solve such a kind of nonlocal problems. Recently, the method of approximate particular solutions using multiquadric (MQ) RBFs has been applied to the time-fractional diffusion equation with nonlocal boundary condition [20].It is well-known that properties of the numerical methods for nonlocal differential problems usually depend on the parameters of nonlocal boundary conditions. For example, the stability of finite difference schemes are related to the spectral properties of certain matrices and, in the case of nonlocal problems, these properties depend on the parameters appearing in nonlocal conditions [21–23]. Therefore, numerical methods for the solution of PDEs with nonlocal conditions require special attention. The influence of nonlocal conditions on the properties of any numerical method which is applied to solve a certain nonlocal problem should always be investigated very carefully.In paper [24], RBF collocation technique was applied to solve a model problem for two-dimensional Poisson equation on the unit rectangle. Two-point or integral condition was formulated on one side of the rectangle. Besides the standard testing of the method, the influence of nonlocal conditions on the optimal selection of the RBF shape parameter, as well as on the conditioning and accuracy of the method was investigated. Later, the same problem has been solved in paper [25], where collocation methods based on Haar wavelets and RBFs have been applied. RBF-based collocation technique was also used to solve a multidimensional elliptic equation with nonlocal integral conditions [26]. The influence of the RBF shape parameter and distribution of the nodes on the accuracy of the method as well as the influence of nonlocal conditions on the conditioning of the collocation matrix were investigated by analysing two- and three-dimensional test problems with the manufactured solutions.In the present work we continue our investigation and consider a model problem which consists of Poisson equation with mixed boundary conditions. One of these conditions is nonlocal multipoint boundary condition relating the boundary values of unknown function to several values inside the domain. A meshless method for the solution of such problem allows us to eliminate connection between the domain discretisation and points defining nonlocal part of the multipoint boundary condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time when an elliptic PDE with nonlocal multipoint boundary condition is solved using an RBF-based meshless method.The main aim of this work is to investigate the properties of the method and, in particular, their dependence on the parameters of nonlocal condition. We do not provide any theoretical results. Instead, we conduct an extensive numerical study. The insights made from the numerical study can help us gain the basic understanding of the properties of the method. It should be mentioned that, when dealing with nonlocal problems, numerical studies (computational experiments) are often utilised as research methods even when such classical and well-established techniques as finite differences are applied (see e.g. [22,27]).The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we give a detailed formulation of the model problem and some additional related references. A meshless method based on RBF collocation is described in Section 3. By analysing a test example, the method is investigated in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper with summarising remarks and possible directions for the future research.A model problem considered in this paper consists of Poisson equation and mixed boundary conditions:1{−Δu=finΩ,(1a)u=gonΓ1,(1b)u=∑xl⁎∈Ω⁎γlu(xl⁎)+honΓ2,(1c)whereΩ⊂Rd(d=2,3) is a bounded domain,∂Ω=Γ1∪Γ2(withΓ1∩Γ2=∅andΓ2≠∅), f, g and h are given functions. While Dirichlet condition (1b) is an example of classical boundary condition, the condition (1c) is nonlocal and relates the values of the solution u on the boundary part Γ2 to the values at the interior pointsxl⁎∈Ω⁎⊂Ω(subsetΩ⁎is discrete). The nonlocal condition (1c) is defined by parameters γlandxl⁎. The weights γlcan be either constants, or functions (γl=γl(x)), or values of the functions atxl⁎∈Ω⁎(γl=γl(xl⁎)). Whenγl≡0, condition (1c) becomes Dirichlet boundary condition. If condition (1c) relates the boundary values to a single interior point (|Ω⁎|=1), it is usually referenced to as Bitsadze–Samarskii nonlocal condition.Nonlocal multipoint boundary conditions are related to nonlocal integral conditions [21]. For instance, the multipoint condition (1c) is a special case of nonlocal integral conditionu=∫Ωγxuxdx+honΓ2.Indeed, we get the nonlocal multipoint boundary condition (1c) when the weight function is defined asγx=∑xl⁎∈Ω⁎γlδ∥x-xl⁎∥2,where δ is the Dirac delta function.Numerical methods for the solution of PDEs with nonlocal discrete boundary conditions have been considered in many papers. For example, we can mention papers related to the approximate solution of nonlocal problems for elliptic [28–31], elliptic–parabolic [32], hyperbolic [33,34], or hyperbolic–parabolic [35] equations with multipoint or Bitsadze–Samarskii nonlocal boundary conditions. The paper [36] presents an efficient way of implementing general multipoint constraint conditions arising in finite element analysis related to structural mechanics. In paper [37], a two-dimensional reaction–diffusion problem with Bitsadze–Samarskii nonlocal boundary condition was solved using meshless local Petrov–Galerkin (MLPG) method and MQ RBFs were used for the spatial discretisation of local weak equations.RBFs already proved to be quite an effective tool both for the scattered data interpolation [10] and approximate solution of PDEs [11–14]. We give a very brief introduction to RBFs. More details can be found in books [9,10,12,14]. The book [12] also reviews the latest advances on RBF collocation methods for the numerical solution of PDEs.A multivariate real-valued functionΦ:Rd→Ris called a radial function if there exists a univariate functionϕ:[0,∞)→Rsuch thatΦ(x)=ϕ(∥x∥),where∥·∥is some norm onRd(usually the Euclidean norm is used). That is, the functionΦ(x)can be expressed in the Euclidean distance variabler=∥x∥.Table 1gives several examples of widely used RBFs. All these RBFs are globally supported and infinitely smooth. The shape (flatness) of each given RBF is controlled by a positive parameter ϵ which is called the shape parameter. Equivalently, a reciprocal shape parameterc=1/ϵalso can be used in the expressions of the same functions.In the case of an interpolation problem, the positive definiteness of RBF is an important property which ensures the invertibility of the interpolation matrix. IMQ, IQ and GA RBFs are strictly positive definite, while MQ RBF is conditionally positive definite of order one [9,10]. The conditional positive definiteness means that the invertibility of the interpolation problem is ensured by adding a polynomial of a certain order to the interpolant and by augmenting the interpolation system with some additional equations. Since the polynomial augmentation can increase the condition number of the interpolant matrix but not necessary the accuracy of the interpolation [38], and singular cases of the interpolation matrix almost never appear in practice, we will construct and investigate the method without such modification.RBF-based collocation methods can be categorised as domain-type or boundary-type methods [12]. The Kansa method applied in this paper is an example of domain-type methods, while the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is one of the well-known boundary-type methods.Instead of meshing, which is an essential procedure, for example, in finite element method, meshless methods require only domain representation by nodes which can be scattered in unstructured fashion. We use the set of nodes (collocation points)Ξ={xi}i=1N⊂Ω¯,which consists of three pairwise disjoint subsets representing domain Ω and its boundary parts Γ1 and Γ2:ΞΩ={x∈Ξ:x∈Ω}⊂Ω,ΞΓ1={x∈Ξ:x∈Γ1}⊂Γ1,ΞΓ2={x∈Ξ:x∈Γ2}⊂Γ2.We assume thatΞ=ΞΩ∪ΞΓ1∪ΞΓ2,ΞΩ≠∅,ΞΓ1≠∅(ifΓ1≠∅) andΞΓ2≠∅. We also assume thatΩ⁎⊂ΞΩ, i.e., pointsxl⁎defining nonlocal boundary condition (1c) are included in the domain representation.When differential problems with nonlocal multipoint boundary conditions are solved using finite differences, usually it is assumed that the pointsxl⁎coincide with some points of the grid (see e.g. [21]). Such assumption simplifies theoretical analysis of the numerical scheme [39] but requires certain modifications. In order to impose nonlocal multipoint boundary condition similar to (1c) in a mesh-based method, we need either to ensure that the pointsxl⁎also would be the nodes of the mesh, or to approximate these points by substituting them with closely located nodes of the mesh. The first approach requires additional mesh modifications, while the latter can decrease the accuracy of the results, especially when coarse mesh is used. Here geometrical flexibility of meshless methods comes in handy. In the case of meshless method, nonlocal multipoint boundary conditions can be imposed without any additional treatment. It is enough to ensure that all pointsxl⁎∈Ω⁎belong to the set Ξ.The collocation points Ξ not necessarily should coincide with the RBF centres (source points). We consider the case when the set of RBF centresΞ′is a subset of the set of collocation points. Thus, we assume thatΞ′={xi′}i=1M⊆Ξ,whereΞ′=ΞΩ′∪ΞΓ1′∪ΞΓ2′withΞΩ′⊆ΞΩ,ΞΓ1′⊆ΞΓ1,ΞΓ2′⊆ΞΓ2, and|Ξ′|=M≤N.As usually, we seek for an approximate solution to the problem (1) in the formu¯(x)=ϕT(x)λ,whereϕ(x)=[ϕ1(x),ϕ2(x),…,ϕM(x)]Tandϕi(x)=ϕ(∥x−xi′∥2)for a given RBF ϕ and a source pointxi′∈Ξ′,∥·∥2denotes the Euclidean norm, andλ=[λ1,λ2,…,λM]Tare the coefficients to be determined using collocation approach.By requiring approximate solutionu¯(x)to satisfy the Poisson equation (1a) on the nodes representing Ω, we get the following linear equations:(2a)−ΔϕT(x)λ=f(x),x∈ΞΩ.From the Dirichlet boundary condition (1b) (ifΓ1≠∅) we obtain equations(2b)ϕT(x)λ=g(x),x∈ΞΓ1,and discretisation of nonlocal multipoint boundary condition (1c) leads to(2c)(ϕT(x)−∑xl⁎∈Ω⁎γlϕT(xl⁎))λ=h(x),x∈ΞΓ2.Thus, in order to determine coefficientsλ, we need to solve the linear system (2):(3)Aλ=b,whereAis the collocation matrix and b is the right-hand side vector. IfM<N, the system (3) is overdetermined and we can treat it a linear least squares problem. The solution of this problem isλ^=argminλ∈RM∥Aλ−b∥2.It is known that matrix(A)N×Mtends to be ill-conditioned asϵ→0. That is probably the main drawback of all collocation methods based on globally supported RBFs. The influence of the shape parameter will be illustrated and some properties of the method will be investigated in the numerical study.A two-dimensional (d=2) problem with the manufactured solution was analysed in order to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the method, as well as to investigate some of its properties. The problem was formulated on the unit rectangle with a cut of the radius R (see Fig. 1). Three different cases (examples) of the weights γlwere considered:Case 1:γlare constants:γl≡γ, γ is a constant.γlare functions:γl=γl(x)≡γ·∥(1,0)−x∥2.γlare values of the functions atxl⁎∈Ω⁎:γl=γl(xl⁎)≡γ·∥xl⁎∥2.The representation of the domain Ω (R=0.5) which was used in the study is depicted in Fig. 3. The boundary parts Γ1 and Γ2 were represented by regularly distributed nodes, while the nodes representing Ω were scattered completely randomly. The set of source points used in the least squares mode wasΞ′=ΞΓ1∪ΞΓ2∪ΞΩ′,whereΞΩ′is consisted of nodes randomly selected fromΞΩ(see Fig. 3). The same representation of the domain as well as given distribution of the source points was used in the entire numerical study.The distribution of the pointsxl⁎∈Ω⁎on the domain Ω was fixed everywhere except the experiment in which the influence of this distribution was investigated. Also we assumed thatγl≡1by default, and different values of γlwere used only when the influence of these parameters was investigated.The accuracy of the method can be estimated using various error measures such as the normalised L2-errorEL2=∑x∈Ξtest(u(x)−u¯(x))2∑x∈Ξtestu2(x).whereΞtest⊂Ω¯is a set of test points. In our numerical study, the accuracy was estimated on the collocation nodes (Ξtest=Ξ). The conditioning of the matrixAwas evaluated using the traditional condition numberκ(A)=σmaxσmin,whereσmaxandσminare the maximal and minimal singular values of the matrix.The method has been implemented in Python programming language using SciPy package. The linear problem (3) was solved using lstsq routine from linalg subpackage [40]. This routine was used to solve both the standard collocation system (M=N) and the least squares problem (M<N). In comparison with the routine solve, which was used in our previous studies [24,26], the routine lstsq allows us to solve the linear problems obtained by using smaller values of the shape parameter ϵ. A useful analysis of direct solvers (available both in Matlab and Python environments) applied to linear systems arising from the interpolation and the approximation of PDEs using RBFs is given in [41].The presented results were obtained using GA RBFs with the shape parameterϵ=2.0andγ≡1, unless mentioned otherwise.
