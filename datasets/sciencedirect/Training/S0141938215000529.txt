Motion in images is essential to cause motion sickness symptoms, but not to increase postural sway

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The effect of visual motion on visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) and postural control was studied.Postural sway is not necessarily increased by visual motion.Visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) seems to be caused by visual motion.Different from sickness, motion in images does not seem to be the necessary condition to increase postural sway.

ObjectiveIt is generally assumed that motion in motion images is responsible for increased postural sway as well as for visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). However, this has not yet been tested. To that end, we studied postural sway and VIMS induced by motion and still images.Method15 Participants were exposed to motion- and still images in separate sessions. Motion images consisted of video clips taken from a first person shooter game. Still images consisted of stills taken every 10s from these same clips. Before, during, and after exposure, VIMS was rated and postural sway was measured. Sway path length, standard deviation and short- and long-term scaling components of the centre of pressure were calculated as measures of postural sway.ResultsVIMS scores obtained during and after exposure to motion images were significantly higher compared to scores obtained before, and directly after exposure to still images. The sway path length, standard deviation in anteroposterior direction and short-term scaling components in mediolateral and anteroposterior direction increased significantly during exposure to motion and still images.ConclusionIn this experiment motion- and still images caused different levels of VIMS, but comparable increases in postural sway. We assume VIMS was caused by a mismatch between visual and vestibular motion cues. The increase in sway during exposure to still images can be explained by visual effects present in still images. The lack of vection in the motion images may explain why sway was not larger when viewing these motion images as compared to viewing the still images.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Motion sickness symptoms may be induced not only by physical motion, as in car-, sea-, or airsickness, but also by watching motion images or dynamic displays [1]. In the latter case, the phenomenon is generally referred to as visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). Also postural control, i.e., “the act of maintaining, achieving or restoring a state of balance during any posture or activity” [2], is known to be affected when exposed to motion images [3–8].The effect of motion images on VIMS and postural sway characteristics has been studied extensively over the years. During passive viewing conditions, it has repeatedly been found that VIMS and postural sway significantly increased during [5–9] or directly after exposure to motion images [3,9]. However, some studies did report no increase, or even a decrease, in postural sway during exposure to motion images, while VIMS increased [10,11].Although motion images are known to have the ability to induce VIMS and increase postural sway, both phenomena can also occur when participants are looking at stationary objects [12], or are unaware of the imposed visual motion [13,14]. Regarding exposure to motion images, to the best of our knowledge, no research has directly addressed whether motion in these images is the factor inducing VIMS and increasing postural sway. Therefore, we made a comparison between watching motion images and still images under otherwise equal circumstances.Two earlier studies did address the effect of motion in images on VIMS and postural sway, however this was not their primary objective [7,8]. Moreover, the exposures were limited to 100s and the results were contradicting. Freeman et al. [8] found a significant effect of motion on VIMS and postural sway, while Ijsselsteijn et al. [7] only found a small effect of motion on VIMS. Thus, whether prolonged exposure to motion in these images is the factor inducing VIMS and increased postural sway still remains uncertain.In this study we therefore exposed participants to motion images and still images from a first-person view for a prolonged duration (up to 36min) in otherwise equal circumstances. If motion would be the factor causing both increased VIMS and postural sway we would expect to find a significant increase in VIMS and sway only when exposed to motion images, with still images affecting neither VIMS nor postural sway.
