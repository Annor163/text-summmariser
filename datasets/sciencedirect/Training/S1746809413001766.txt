Reformulation of the pressure-dependent recruitment model (PRM) of respiratory mechanics

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The pressure recruitment model (PRM) accurately captures P–V responses of ARDS patients.The efficacy of the PRM model was assessed with reduced model variable sets.The reduced PRM was still able to capture ARDS patients P–V responses to LF manoeuvres.Hence, the original PRM was over parameterised for this cohort and experimental protocol.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundThe pressure dependent recruitment model (PRM) is a comprehensive mathematical description of pulmonary mechanics in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, previous investigations of the PRM implied that the number of model parameters may cause inaccurate parameter estimation.MethodsPRM models were evaluated for 12 ARDS patients that underwent a low-flow recruitment manoeuvre. The identified parameter set formed the basis of a parameter reduction investigation of the PRM. The parameter reduction investigation measured the mean cohort residual error (ψ) yielded by each possible combination of identified parameter set with the non-identified parameter values set to a priori population constants.ResultsReducing the five variable PRM to a particular three variable model configuration produced a limited increase in model fit to data residuals (ψ5=22.68, ψ3=29.21mbar). The reduced model evaluates airway-resistance, compliance and distension as model variables and uses population values for alveoli opening pressure and the ratio of open alveoli at end expiratory.ConclusionsThe reduced PRM model captures all major pressure–volume response features in the ARDS patients. Reduced parameterisation allows more robust parameter identification and thus more reliable parameter estimates that may prove more useful in a clinical setting.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Model-based decision support has been applied to respiratory support in critical care and has provided improved patient outcomes and healthcare cost-efficiency [1]. The methodology typically characterises patient-specific pressure–volume (PV) responses mathematically and uses this characterisation to predict the response to therapy [2–4]. Hence, therapeutic choices can be assessed prior to application and the risk of excessive pressure harming alveoli or insufficient tidal volume and oxidation can be mitigated [5,6].Mathematical characterisation of the patient's PV response is achieved by fitting a model of PV mechanics to patient data [7,8]. Respiratory mechanics models differ in their level of parameterisation and their ability to describe the characteristics that occur in typical PV response curves [2,3,9]. The most clinically useful model formulations are capable of capturing the patient characteristics that are important for modelling the potential patient responses to particular therapeutic choices. However, ascertaining the ideal model formulation or level of parameterisation is difficult process and may be different for different patient groups [2,8]. In particular, increasing the parameterisation of the model typically increases the models ability to exactly capture all of the PV characteristics that appear in data. However, increased parameterisation also increases parameter trade-off, and potentially limits the parameter estimation accuracy and predictive capability of the model for different respiratory loading conditions [10,11].This investigation re-parameterises the pressure-dependent recruitment model (PRM) defined by Schranz et al. The PRM model is a mathematical formulation of the Hickling description of respiratory mechanics [12]. Hickling described lung recruitment as a discrete process in which layers of alveoli open at particular evenly distributed opening pressures. The Schranz et al. formulation includes compliance and distension characteristics to fully model the mechanics through a broad pressure range. However, the model requires identification of five model parameters. Although theoretical structural parameter identifiability has been proven in a third order Taylor Series approximation to the model [7], the practical identifiability of the model has proven troublesome [7,13,14] due to the similarity in model input–output roles [10].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Stage one of this analysis has confirmed the efficacy of the PRM for accurately modelling PV response curves of ARDS patients. The mean population parameter values obtained in stage one allowed a de-parameterisation investigation. The de-parameterisation investigation indicated that the original PRM model was over-parameterised for the LF experiment on the average of 12 patients. The best three parameter variable set of those tested was identified and resulted in a minimal increase in model residuals from the five parameter case and improved parameter identification robustness.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest
