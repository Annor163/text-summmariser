@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Condition monitoring (CM) and manual inspection are increasingly used in industry to identify a system's state so that necessary preventive maintenance (PM) decisions can be made. In this paper, we present a model that considers a single-unit system subject to both CM and additional manual inspections. There are two preset control limits: an inspection threshold and a preventive replacement (PR) threshold. When a CM measurement is equal to or greater than the inspection threshold but is less than the PR threshold, a manual inspection activity is initiated. When a CM measurement is greater than the PR threshold, a PR activity should be carried out. The system's degradation process evolves according to a two-stage failure process: the normal working stage, which is from new to the initial point that a defect occurs, with the CM measurement coming from a stochastic process; and the delay-time stage, which is from the initial point that a defect occurs until the point of failure, with the CM measurement coming from an increasing stochastic process. We assume that a manual inspection is perfect in that it can always identify which of these two stages the system is in. In our study, the decision variables are the CM interval and the inspection threshold, and we aim to minimize the expected cost per unit time. We provide a numerical example to demonstrate the applicability and solution procedure of the model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Condition monitoring (CM) and manual inspection are maintenance activities that are commonly observed in industry (Christer & Wang, 1995; Grall, Berenguer, & Dieulle, 2002; Jardine, Joseph, & Banjevic, 1999; Jiang, 2010; Luo, Osypiw, & Irle, 2000; Nakagawa, Mizutani, & Chen, 2010; Vlok, Coetzee, Banjevic, Jardine, & Makis, 2002; Wang, 2008a, 2008b, 2011a; Wiseman, 2001). Both activities assess the system state and seek to identify any problems within it. However, the methods they use to achieve this are different. In general, CM utilizes some monitoring devices, whereas inspections are usually manual checks. CM can be carried out while the system is still operating, whereas manual inspections often require that the system be shut down. CM generally monitors the plant system on a periodic basis and obtains a sample of its measurements from the sensors on the plant system. However, in most cases, CM measurements are imprecise and uncertain. Such randomness of measurements may be due to measurement errors or other uncontrollable factors (Wang, 2006). This is why, in addition to CM, manual inspections are sometimes required, i.e., to ensure a thorough assessment of the system's condition and to confirm whether – based on the recommendation of CM – there is a problem or not (Christer, Wang, & Sharp, 1997; Jiang, 2010). For example, in Christer et al. (1997), a furnace is monitored by the induction ratio, and once this ratio is higher than a predefined overhaul threshold, the furnace is shut down for an overhaul. In addition, there is another threshold – the warning threshold – and if the induction ratio is between this threshold and the overhaul threshold, then the furnace is checked during a production window and overhauled, if necessary. In a water pump study by Wang, Scarf, and Smith (2000), the feedback from the CM provider contained three recommendations: to keep an eye on the pump whose vibration is near to the lower threshold of vibration; to shut down the pump for a thorough manual check if it is above the lower threshold; and to repair/replace the pump immediately if the vibration signal is above an upper threshold.It is generally assumed that a manual inspection costs more than the equivalent CM since a manual inspection results in certain downtime. CM can be carried out without any supplementary manual inspections, and many past researches have been devoted to this area of study (Han & Song, 2003; Jardine & Banjevic, 2005; Kim & Makis, 2013; Kim, Jiang, Makis, & Lee, 2011; Maillart, 2006; Wang, 2008a; Wiseman, 2001). CM can be imprecise and the noise is considered to form a control-limit-type maintenance policy (Kim & Makis, 2013). Manual inspections can be carried out without any CM, and this is also an extensively studied subject (Cui, Loh, & Xie, 2004; Cui, Xie, & Loh, 2004; Nakagawa et al., 2010; Taghipour, Banjevic, & Jardine, 2010; Vaurio, 1994). However, we found no paper that modeled a similar scenario to the one we propose here, i.e., one which takes CM into consideration when modeling manual inspections. The closest scenario is found in the paper by Jiang (2010) where he modeled a CM case with sequential inspections. However, the inspection defined in Jiang's paper is the action used to obtain the accurate CM measurement rather than the manual inspection defined in our paper. Moreover, Wang (2011b) and Wu and Wang (2011) used a similar idea to ours when modeling two types of errors in statistical quality control.The delay-time concept has been studied extensively and has been applied to model inspection practice (Wang, 2008b, 2012). This concept considers the system failure process as having two stages: the normal working stage, which is from new to the initial point that a defect is identified at an inspection; and the delay-time stage, which is from the initial point of the identifiable defect to failure (if the defect is left unattended). If an inspection is carried out during the delay-time, the defect can be identified and removed immediately or subsequently, depending on the quality of the inspection and defect removal. A number of case studies have successfully applied delay-time modeling techniques to industrial plant systems. See Wang (2012) for a recent review of delay-time models and their applications.The principal idea of this paper is motivated from industrial observations and the literature on condition-based maintenance and inspection modeling. In particular, we attempt to model a situation where both CM and manual inspections are in place to assess the state of the system and perform preventive replacement (PR) – if necessary – under the delay-time concept framework. This is one of the main contributions of the paper, since, to our knowledge, condition-based maintenance models used in conjunction with the delay-time modeling technique have not yet been reported (Wang, 2012).Another contribution of this paper is that we also try to overcome an existing problem in CM-based degradation models whereby system failure is only defined as the time that the CM measurement first reaches a predefined failure threshold, such as the first hitting time concept (Si, Wang, Hu, Chen, & Zhou, 2013). We argue that the system can fail before the CM measurement reaches the threshold, and such a threshold is mainly for PM, as we have observed in industry (Wang, 2011b, Wang et al., 2000). Our first argument is correct because the CM measurement has a stochastic relationship with the system state. Our second argument has been supported by industry observations, where the threshold is used to define the time for some PM actions rather than for real system failure. For this purpose, we model two related processes: the delay-time concept of a two-stage failure process, and the degradation process (with the measured CM data correlated with the two-stage failure process).The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 presents the problem description; Section 3 provides the modeling assumptions and notations; Section 4 details the cost model; Section 5 presents two detailed models based on some typical degradation processes; Section 6 presents numerical examples; and Section 7 concludes the paper.We consider a single-unit system subject to a dominant failure mode. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the failure process of the system has two stages: from new to the initiation of a defect (the normal working stage); and from this point to failure, if left unattended (the delay-time stage). The failed state is always identifiable, but the other two stages are random in their durations and are not directly observable unless a manual inspection is carried out. This follows the standard definition used in delay-time-based inspection models (Wang, 2012). Additionally, a CM process sampled at discrete time points reveals the system condition. Here, we need to consider that two errors (based on the obtained CM measurement) could occur: the CM measurement could indicate that the system is in the normal working stage while it is actually in the delay-time stage, and vice versa. The measured CM variable is related to the underlying failure process. It follows a combined stochastic deterioration process of non-decreasing trends with noise during the whole life of the system. However, such a process is also divided into two stages, each with different trends. There are two thresholds. One is the PR threshold, and if the CM measurement is above this threshold then the system is preventively replaced. We call this preventive replacement PR1. The other is the inspection threshold, and if the CM measurement is between this threshold and the PR threshold then an in-depth manual inspection is performed on the system. Such an inspection is assumed to be perfect in that it can always identify which stage the system is in. If the system is identified as being in the delay-time stage, it is preventively replaced. We call this preventive replacement PR2. If the system is not identified as being in the delay-time stage here, then no action is taken. A situation could also occur where a system reaches the end of its life before any PR, in which case a failure replacement occurs. All replacements are considered equivalent to renewals but with different costs. The decision variables in this problem are the CM interval and the inspection threshold, while we assume that the PR threshold is fixed according to engineering experience. In theory, with increased computational effort, more than two thresholds can be utilized. However, in practice we have observed that there are mostly just one or two thresholds. A two-threshold policy defines a three-state process that was popularly accepted and used in CM practice and in most CM related literature (Christer & Wang 1995; Wu & Wang, 2011). This problem can be observed in reality, e.g., in induction furnaces, battery systems, motors, industrial pumps and bearings. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of the delay-time concept and the replacement scenarios of such systems.The modeling assumptions used in this paper are as follows:1.The system is a single-unit system subject to a single failure mode.CM is carried out at a constant interval of t, which is a decision variable.The system failure process develops in two stages: a normal working stage and a delay-time stage with degradation developing.The CM measurement thresholds have two control limits. First, regarding the PR threshold, once the CM measurement is above this threshold, the system is preventively replaced without further manual inspection. This threshold is set by industrial standards or engineering experience and should be strictly followed. Second, regarding the inspection threshold, if the CM measurement is between the inspection and PR thresholds, an in-depth manual inspection is carried out on the system. Such an inspection is perfect in that it can always identify which stage the system is in. Once the inspection reveals that the system is in the delay-time stage, the system is also preventively replaced. However, if the inspection reveals that the system is in the normal working stage then the system does not need any preventive action.The system can reach the end of its life before any PR. A failure replacement then occurs.All replacements are considered to be equivalent to renewals but with different costs. We assume the average cost of a failure renewal is higher than the average cost of a PR1 or PR2 renewal, which are both equal.Assumption 1 is common in CM practice, since CM is usually sensor-based in order to monitor an important component system with a key failure mode, such as fatigue, stress or wear. The assumption can be relaxed, but this will require a different type of model, which is not the focus of this paper. Assumption 2 is an observed industry practice. In some cases CM can be continuous, such as where online sensors are used to continuously provide information about the system condition. However, the majority of CM in industries such as vibration or oil monitoring is periodic (Bajric, Sprecic, & Zuber, 2011; Coronado & Kupferschmidt, 2014; Liu, Ling, & Gribonval, 2002; Luo et al., 2000; Muszynska, 1995; Newell, 1999; Nikolaou & Antiadis, 2002). Assumption 3 is the definition of the delay-time concept, which has been used extensively (Wang, 2012). Assumption 4 has been explained in the introduction section and can also be found in industry practice. Assumption 5 is self-explanatory. Assumption 6 is also realistic, since the cost of a failure replacement involves the extra downtime cost, whereas PR does not have this additional cost. Here, we assume that both PRs cost the same, since the inspection cost is considered separately.tCM intervalPR thresholdInspection thresholdRandom normal working stage duration with realization u, probability density function (pdf) fU(u) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) FU(u)Random delay-time stage duration with realization h, pdf fH(h) and cdf FH(h)Measured CM variable at CM time τ from new, which is influenced by the state of the system; When τ < u, the pdf and cdf of ZτarefZτ′(Zτ|τ)andFZτ′(Zτ|τ), respectively and whenu≤τ<u+h, the pdf and cdf of ZτarefZτ−u′′(Zτ−u|τ−u)andFZτ−u′′(Zτ−u|τ−u), respectivelyThe joint probability function of the CM variables at all CM points during the normal working stageThe joint probability function of the CM variables of all CM points during the delay-time stageAverage cost of a failure renewalAverage cost of a PR renewalAverage cost of an in-depth manual inspectionAverage cost of a CMExpected failure renewal cycle cost with the failure occurring in((i−1)t,it], the ith CM interval, and with t and z as the decision variablesExpected PR1 renewal cycle cost with the PR renewal at it, the ith CM point, when Zτis equal to or larger than ZExpected PR2 renewal cycle cost with the PR renewal at it after the in-depth inspection confirmed the delay-time stageExpected failure renewal cycle length with the failure occurring in((i−1)t,it]Expected PR1 renewal cycle length with the PR renewal at it, the ith CM point, whenZτis equal to or larger than ZExpected PR2 renewal cycle length with the PR renewal at it after the in-depth inspection confirmed the delay-time stageExpected renewal cycle cost with a renewal in ((i–1)t,it]Expected renewal cycle length in ((i–1)t,it]Expected cost per unit time with the CM interval t and the inspection threshold z as the decision variablesIn this paper we seek to determine the optimal CM interval, t, and the inspection threshold, z, in terms of the expected cost per unit time. To do so, we use the renewal reward theorem to formulate the expected cost per unit time as the objective function (Ross, 2007). This is given as(1)C(t,z)=∑i=1∞E(C;it,z)∑i=1∞E(L;it,z).Now we pay attention to the formulations of E(C;it,z) and E(L;it,z), which require the formulation of renewal probabilities. Within each CM interval, or at the end of the CM interval, there is the possibility of any one of three mutually exclusive renewal events for each renewal cycle: a renewal by failure when the life of the system expires, a renewal by a PR1 when Zτis equal to or larger than Z, and a renewal by a PR2 when z ≤ Zτ< Z and an in-depth manual inspection confirms that the system is in the delay-time stage. We now model the respective E(C;it,z) and E(L;it,z) of these three renewals.We derive the formulation for the case where the system is failure renewed in((i−1)t,it]and (j-1)t < U < jt, j=1,…,i. Here, we need to consider that two errors (based on the CM measurement) could occur: the CM measurement could indicate that the system is in the normal working stage while it is actually in the delay-time stage, and vice versa. Fig. 2 depicts the situation.Since at each CM point lt, l ≤ j-1 there could be either Zlt < z or z ≤ Zlt < Z, and at each CM point lt, j ≤ l ≤ (i-1), we must have Zlt < z. This leads to(2)Ef(C,it,z)=∑j=1i∫(j−1)tjtfU(u)∫0Z(∑k=0j−1Cj−1j−1−k(Cf+(i−1)Cm+(j−1−k)Cs)P1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)·P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t|zu)·[FH(it−u)−FH((i−1)t−u)])dzudu,whereCj−1j−1−k=(j−1)!k!(j−1−k)!,FH(x)x<0=0, andP2(·)(j=i)=1·P1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)is defined as the joint probability function of zuand all j-1 CM variables at the normal working stage, with k of the j-1 CM measurements being less than z, and j-1-k of the j-1 CM measurements being between z and Z.P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t|zu)is defined as the joint probability function of all (j-i) CM variables at the delay-time stage, with all of them being less than z and conditioning on zu. zuis the CM variable at u, which is unknown and must be integrated out.The expected cycle length resulting from a failure renewal in ((i-1)t, it) is given by(3)Ef(L,it,z)=∑j=1i∫(j−1)tjt(u+h)fU(u)∫0Z(∑k=0j−1Cj−1j−1−kP1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)·P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t|zu)·∫(i−1)t−uit−ufH(h)dh)dzudu.In Eqs. (2) and (3), we assume that, at the delay-time stage, the increment of the CM variable over each interval is independent. This is a mathematical simplification that is commonly used in the degradation modeling of CM data (Si et al., 2013). SoP2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t|zu)can be written as(4)P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t|zu)=∫−∞z−zuf′′Zjt−u(zjt−zu|jt−u)∫−∞z−zjtf′′Z(j+1)t−u(z(j+1)t−zjt|(j+1)t−u)⋯∫−∞z−z(i−2)tf′′Z(i−1)t−u(z(i−1)t−z(i−2)t|(i−1)t−u)d(z(i−1)t−z(i−2)t)…d(z(j+1)t−zjt)d(zjt−zu).Fig. 3 shows one situation where a PR1 renewal occurs at it if Zit≥ Z and (j-1)t < U < jt, j = 1,…,i. Since at each lt,l≤j−1, there could be either Zlt < z or z ≤ Zlt < Z, and at each lt,j≤l≤(i−1), we must have Zlt < z.We have from Fig. 3 that(5)EPR11(C,it,z)=∑j=1i∫(j−1)tjtfU(u)∫0Z(∑k=0j−1Cj−1j−1−k(Cp+iCm+(j−1−k)Cs)P1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)·P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,Zit−Z(i−1)t≥Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)(1−FH(it−u)))dzudu,and(6)EPR11(L,it,z)=∑j=1iit∫(j−1)tjtfU(u)∫0Z(∑k=0j−1Cj−1j−1−kP1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,Zit−Z(i−1)t≥Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)(1−FH(it−u)))dzudu.In Eqs. (5) and (6), following the assumption of an independent increment,P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,Zit−Z(i−1)t≥Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)can be written as(7)P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,Zit−Z(i−1)t≥Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)=∫−∞z−zuf′′Zjt−u(zjt−zu|jt−u)∫−∞z−zjtf′′Z(j+1)t−u(z(j+1)t−zjt|(j+1)t−u)…·∫−∞z−zi−2fZ(i−1)t−u(z(i−1)t−z(i−2)t|(i−1)t−u)∫Z−z(i−1)t∞fZit−u(zit−z(i−1)t|it−u)d(zit−z(i−1)t)d(z(i−1)t−z(i−2)t)…d(z(j+1)t−zjt)d(zjt−zu).Fig. 4shows another situation where a PR1 renewal occurs at it if Zit≥ Z and U > it, i=1,2,….Since at each lt,l≤i−1, there could be either Zlt < z or z ≤ Zlt < Z, the expected cycle cost and length for a PR1 renewal at it is given by(8)EPR12(C,it,z)=(1−FU(it))(∑k=0i−1Ci−1i−1−k(Cp+iCm+(i−1−k)Cs)P1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′i−1−k<Z︸i−1−k,Zit≥Z)),(9)EPR12(L,it,z)=it(1−FU(it))(∑k=0i−1Ci−1i−1−kP1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′i−1−k<Z︸i−1−k,Zit≥Z)).It follows thatEPR1(C,it,z)=EPR11(C,it,z)+EPR12(C,it,z)andEPR1(L,it,z)=EPR11(L,it,z)+EPR12(L,it,z).The general cast of the expected renewal cycle cost and length formulation is constructed for the PR2 renewal at it. This requires z ≤ Zit< Z at it. It follows that(10)EPR2(C,it,z)=∑j=1i∫(j−1)tjtfU(u)∫0Z(∑k=0j−1Cj−1j−1−k(Cp+iCm+(j−k)Cs)P1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)·P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,z−Z(i−1)t≤Zit−Z(i−1)t<Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)(1−FH(it−u)))dzudu,and(11)EPR2(L,it,z)=∑j=1iit∫(j−1)tjtfU(u)∫0Z(∑k=0j−1Cj−1j−1−kP1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,z−Z(i−1)t≤Zit−Z(i−1)t<Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)·(1−FH(it−u)))dzudu.In Eqs. (10) and (11), following the assumption of an independent increment,P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,z−Z(i−1)t≤Zit−Z(i−1)t<Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)can be written as(12)P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,z−Z(i−1)t≤Zit−Z(i−1)t<Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)=∫−∞z−zuf′′Zjt−u(zjt−zu|jt−u)∫−∞z−zjtf′′Z(j+1)t−u(z(j+1)t−zjt|(j+1)t−u)……∫−∞z−zi−2f′′Z(i−1)t−u(z(i−1)t−z(i−2)t|(i−1)t−u)∫z−zi−1Z−zi−1f′′Zit−u(zit−z(i−1)t|it−u)d(zit−z(i−1)t)d(z(i−1)t−z(i−2)t)……d(z(j+1)t−zjt)d(zjt−zu).Based on the expected cycle cost and length with different renewals, the respective expected renewal cycle cost and length are(13)E(C;it,z)=Ef(C;it,z)+EPR1(C;it,z)+EPR2(C;it,z),and(14)E(L;it,z)=Ef(L;it,z)+EPR1(L;it,z)+EPR2(L;it,z).This completes our expected cost per unit time formulation with the CM interval, t, and inspection threshold, z, as the decision variables. Note that Eqs. (2)–(14) are general expressions and, in most cases, it is impossible to have analytical solutions. Numerically they are also extremely difficult to calculate due to the convolution of integrals. Below, we present simpler examples based on some typical degradation processes, with some additional assumptions to help facilitate computations.Now we propose two models: first, a model characterized by a white noise process during the normal working stage and a Brownian Motion (BM) with a drift process during the delay-time stage; Second, a model for a deterioration process characterized by a gamma process. The BM with the drift and gamma processes are the most used degradation process with an independent increment in literature (Si, Wang, Hu, Zhou, & Pecht, 2012). A characteristic feature of the BM with drift is that a system's degradation alternately increases and decreases. This makes the process inadequate for modeling deterioration, which is monotone (Doksum & Hoyland, 1992). The gamma process is a stochastic process with independent, non-negative increments and is suitable for modeling gradual damage that monotonically accumulates over time in a sequence of tiny increments (van Noortwijk, Cooke, & Kok, 1995).The system failure process develops in two stages: a normal working stage and a delay-time stage with developing degradation. The CM measurements are related to the underlying failure process, and also follows a two-stage process: a white noise process during the normal working stage and an increasing trend process with increasing noise during the delay-time stage (Alvandi & Cremona, 2006). Such an increasing trend process during the delay-time stage is assumed to follow a drifted BM process, which is a very popular method in modeling degradation (Balka, Desmond, & McNicholas, 2009). This assumption is in line with vibration monitoring observations.We start first with the drifted BM process(15)Zτ={Z0+ɛ0,τ<u,Zτ′+η(τ−τ′)+σ(w(τ)−w(τ′)),u≤τ′<τ<u+h,where ɛ0 ∼ N(0, σ0),(w(τ)−w(τ′))∼N(0,σ2(τ−τ′)), and u and h are the durations of the normal working and delay-time stages, respectively;σ02is the variance of Zτat the normal working stage of the system and Z0 is the mean of Zτat the normal working stage of the system; η and σ are the drift parameter and the diffusion parameter of the drifted BM, respectively.Now we present the cdf of the first hitting time,TZ, at which the degradation process crosses the PR threshold. TZfollows an inverse Gaussian distribution (Doksum & Hoyland, 1992), i.e.,(16)P(TZ≤h)=1−Φ(Z−Z0−ηhσh)+exp[2η(Z−Z0)σ2][1−Φ(Z−Z0+ηhσh)],where Φ(y) is the cdf of the standard normal variable withy=(x−ηt)/σt, and x is a normal variable with mean ηt and variance σ2t.Since we have used two processes, one for the failure process characterized by the delay-time concept and another for the degradation, there should be some relationship between them. Here we mainly refer to the relationship between the delay-time stage and the drifted BM at the delay-time stage. It is generally expected that the degradation process of the delay-time stage, once it starts, will reach the PR threshold stochastically earlier than the delay-time of failure, so that it can have some kind of preventive effect. In the numerical example section, we will choose the parameters of the delay-time pdf and the inverse Gaussian distributions so that P(TZ≤ x) > P(H ≤ x).According to the model constructed in Section 4, at the normal working stage, we assume that the monitored signal displays a random white noise process. The measured CM variable is independent, so in Eqs. (2), (3), (5), (6), (10) and (11),∫0Z∑k=0j−1P1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)dzucan be rewritten as(17)∫0Z∑k=0j−1P1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)dzu=P1(z≤Zτ<Z)j−1−kP1(Zτ<z)k∫0Zf′Zu(zu|u)dzu=∑k=0j−1[∫zZ1σ02πe−(zτ−Z0)2σ02dzτ]j−1−k[∫−∞z1σ02πe−(zτ−Z0)2σ02dzτ]k∫0Z1σ02πe−(zu−Z0)22σ02dzu=∑k=0j−1[Φ(Z−Z0σ0)−Φ(z−Z0σ0)]j−1−k[Φ(z−Z0σ0)],k∫0Z1σ02πe−(zu−Z0)22σ02dzu,and since a PR1 renewal occurs at it if Zit≥ Z and U > it, in Eqs.

During the deterioration process of the system, the measured total degradation at the kth monitoring point is affected by the system degradations of the previous monitoring points. This implies that though the increments are independent the total degradations are not. From the equations presented in Section 4, it is almost impossible to get the analytical solution or a numerical approximation. We therefore propose the following theorem in order to get an approximate analytical solution.Theorem 1The n random variablesX1,X2,…,Xnare not independent, but assuming that all incrementsΔXj=Xj−Xj−1(j=1,2,…,n)are equal to or greater than 0, then the joint probability function of the n random variablesX1,X2,…,XnisP(X1<a,X2<a,…,Xn<a)=P(Xn<a).ProofP(X1<a,X2<a,…,Xn<a)=P(ΔX1<a,ΔX2<a−ΔX1,…,ΔXn<a−∑l=1n−1ΔXl)=P(ΔX1<a,ΔX1<a−ΔX2,…,ΔX1<a−∑l=2nΔXl)=P(ΔX1<a−∑l=2nΔXl)=P(Xn<a),This assumption needs some explanation. The increment over an interval in a drifted BM process can, in theory, be positive or negative. However, when the interval is relatively long with an increasing trend, we can assume the interval is positive with only a small probability of being negative. By ignoring this small probability we get the theorem. According to the theorem, Eqs. (4), (7) and (12) can be simplified respectively as(19)P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t|zu)=P2(Z(i−1)t−zu<z−zu|zu)=Φ(z−zu−η((i−1)t−u)σ(i−1)t−u),(20)P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,Zit−Z(i−1)t≥Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)=P2(Z(i−1)t−zu<z−zu,Zit−Z(i−1)t≥Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)=∫0z−zu1σ2π((i−1)t−u)e−((z(i−1)t−zu)−η((i−1)t−u))22σ2((i−1)t−u)[1−Φ(Z−(z(i−1)t−zu)−zu−ηtσt)]d(z(i−1)t−zu),and(21)P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t,z−Z(i−1)t≤Zit−Z(i−1)t<Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)=P2(Z(i−1)t−zu<z−zu,z−Z(i−1)t≤Zit−Z(i−1)t<Z−Z(i−1)t|zu)=∫0z−zu1σ2π((i−1)t−u)e−((z(i−1)t−zu)−η((i−1)t−u)22σ2((i−1)t−u)[Φ(Z−(z(i−1)t−zu)−zu−ηtσt)−Φ(z−(z(i−1)t−zu)−zu−ηtσt)]d(z(i−1)t−zu).Substituting Eqs. (17), (18) and (19)–(21) into Eqs. (2), (3), (5) (6) and (8)–(11), the formulation of the expected renewal cycle cost and length of the three possible renewals can be calculated.For the stochastic modeling of monotonic and gradual deterioration, the gamma process is the most appropriate. It is particularly suitable for oil monitoring, where the total metal concentrations are recorded. The CM measurements may show a slower monotonous increasing trend during the normal working stage and a faster increasing trend during the delay-time stage. The CM measurements at each CM point are not independent, but their increments are independent. We assume that the CM measurement increments during the normal working stage follow a gamma process 1 with shape parameter v1 > 0 and scale parameter β1 > 0, and during the delay-time stage they follow a gamma process 2 with shape parameter v2> 0 and scale parameter β2 > 0. The pdfs of the increment of the normal working and delay-time stages are (Avramidis, L'Ecuyer, & Tremblay, 2003)(22)Zτ−Zτ′∼{Ga1(v1(τ−τ′),β1)=β1v1(τ−τ′)Γ(v1(τ−τ′))(Zτ−Zτ′)[v1(τ−τ′)−1]e[−(Zτ−Zτ′)β1],τ′<τ<u,Ga2(v2(τ−τ′),β2)=β2v2(τ−τ′)Γ(v2(τ−τ′))(Zτ−Zτ′)[v2(τ−τ′)−1]e[−(Zτ−Zτ′)β2],u<τ′<τ<u+h,whereΓ(a)=∫0∞ca−1e−cdcis the gamma function for a > 0.From the gamma-distributed deterioration in Eq. (22), let the time at which PR1 occurs be denoted by time TZ(also called the first hitting time of the PR threshold) at the delay-time stage. The cdf of TZcan be written as (van Noortwijk, 2009)(23)P(TZ≤h)=Γ(v2h,β2Z)Γ(v2h),whereΓ(a,x)=∫x∞ca−1e−cdcis the incomplete gamma function for x ≥ 0 and a > 0.We will still deliberately choose the parameters of the delay-time and the first hitting time distributions so that, in the numerical example section, P(TZ≤ x) > P(H ≤ x).According to the model constructed in Section 4, we consider that the CM measurements show a monotonous increasing trend during the two-stage failure process. The theorem becomes exact in this case so that, when a CM measurement enters into the range [z, Z) at the (k + 1)(k=0,1,…,j−1)CM point during the normal working stage, one of the three possible failure renewals of the system can occur at the interval((j−1)t,jt]sinceU∈((j−1)t,jt]and the inspection is perfect.∫0Z∑k=0j−1P1(Zτ1<z,…,Zτk<z︸k,z≤Zτ′1<Z,…,z≤Zτ′j−1−k<Z︸j−1−k,zu)P2(Zjt−zu<z−zu,Z(j+1)t−Zjt<z−Zjt,…,Z(i−1)t−Z(i−2)t<z−Z(i−2)t|zu)dzuin Eqs.

(24)–(27) in terms of Eq. (22) can be found in Appendix A as Eqs. (A1)–(A4). Substituting Eqs. (A1)–(A4) into Eqs. (2), (3), (5), (6) and (8)–(11), the expected renewal cycle cost and length of the three possible renewals can be calculated.The model parameters are chosen according to our experience from previous PM case studies, but are modified according to the needs of the models presented in this paper. We assume that the normal working stage and the delay-time stage both follow a Weibull distribution (Cui et al., 2004; Jiang, 2010; Wang, 2008b, 2011a). The chosen distribution forms and their parameters are shown in Table 1.In addition, Table 2lists the various costs and the values of the PR thresholds Z, Z0 and σ0 for the numerical example.The cost parameters can be obtained from field records in industry (Wang, 2011a). The more difficult task is in the estimation of the model parameters in Tables 1 and 2. If sufficient failure and PM data exist, they can be estimated via the maximum likelihood method (Si et al., 2013; Wang, 2012). Alternatively, in the case of a small data sample size, a Bayesian method can be employed for the task (Wang & Jia, 2007).With the availability of an objective function, we can find the optimal values of t and z by employing an optimization algorithm. However, for the purpose of illustration we adopt an exhaustive method to find the minimum value of Eq. (1). The result of the optimal combinations of CM interval t and inspection threshold z by minimizing the expected cost per unit time of Eq. (1) is shown in Fig. 5. This is achieved by calculating the objective function of Eq. (1) using a combination of integer values of t and z. The result found using this method may not be the absolute optimum but, in practice, managers tend to use integer values for easy planning and control. From Fig. 5 we can observe that the minimum of C(t, z) can be found at z* = 13 and t*= 8 (days) with C(t*, z*) being 19.94. We also run a simulation test based on the same parameter values of our model, to check and validate our approximation using the theorem and the correctness of our model formulation. Similar to Fig. 5, we obtain a matrix of C(t, z) with different combinations of t and z. We then simulate 10000 renewals, which are averaged to obtain C(t, z). We find that z=13 and t=8 (days) are still the optimal integer values with C(t, z) = 21.85, which is close to 19.94.Since a lower inspection threshold, z, will lead to frequent in-depth manual inspections to the system, it may not always be profitable to frequently inspect the system if the inspection procedure is costly. On the other hand, a higher inspection threshold, z, tends to run the risk that the system is working under a deterioration state with an increased risk of failure. A similar argument can also be applied to the interval of CM in that a smaller t will lead to more frequent CMs and a reduced number of failures, but an increased cost of CM. The opposite conclusion can also be drawn if the interval of CM is large. The optimal combination of t and z should exist in certain cases, and Fig. 5 demonstrates such a case.Next, we further analyze the influence of each decision variable on the expected cost per unit time. The expected cost per unit time is considered as a function of two decision variables: inspection threshold z and CM interval t. To ensure the analysis is thorough, four different cases are considered: case 1, the base-line case, where the cost parameters are as shown in Table 2; case 2, the expensive PR case, where Cpis increased by 100 from case 1; case 3, the expensive manual inspection case, where Csis increased by 100 from case 1; and case 4, the expensive CM case, where Cmis increased by 100 from case 1. The purpose of proposing these four cases is to see which cost parameter has more impact on the expected cost per unit time and its influence on the decision variables. Table 3and Fig. 6 show the results of the numerical optimization of the four cases.It can be seen from Table 3 and Fig. 6 that Cmhas the biggest impact on the expected cost per unit time with the same amount of increment on cost. This is due to Cmbeing used many times in the cost function of Eq. (13) whereas Cpis only used once and Csis used a few times when needed. All four cases show that the expected cost per unit time increases in z and t when they are bigger (z > 13 and t > 10 (days)). The optimal points can be easily located when the other decision variable is fixed. It can also be seen from Fig. 6 that t is more sensitive than z. As the CM interval increases, the probability of the occurrence of failure grows. This will lead to a rapid increase in cost, while the changes of other cost parameters become negligible.Similarly, we adopt an exhaustive method with integer values to find an approximate minimum value of the expected cost per unit time of the model based on the gamma process, as shown in Fig. 7.Fig. 7 shows that the minimum of C(t, z) can be found around z* = 15 and t*= 7 (days) with C(t*, z*) being 23.57. We run a similar simulation test on the gamma-process-based model, obtaining a matrix of C(t, z) with different combinations of t and z. We then simulate 10000 renewals, which are averaged to obtain C(t, z). The optimal integer result is the same as Fig. 7 with C(t = 7, z = 15) = 23.02. This result is close to the theoretical output from the model, with the tiny difference being due to the randomness of the simulations. Compared with the result of the model based on a BM with drift, the gamma-process-based model is exact in terms of the theorem. Therefore, the difference between the simulation and theoretical results is small.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In most CM cases there is a stochastic relationship between the CM measurement and the true state of the monitored system. Therefore, CM measurements cannot completely reflect the true state of the monitored system. A manual inspection is most likely called when the CM measurement shows some sign of system abnormality. However, there is generally an upper threshold to the CM measurement that, if reached, forces the system to be renewed. These points have been well observed in industry but are less studied in literature. In particular, the system can fail before the CM measurement reaches a predefined PR threshold. Motivated by the industrial observation and the review of existing literature, we established a PR model that incorporates CM and in-depth inspection for a deteriorating system based on a two-stage failure process. Two CM measurement thresholds were used, one defines an inspection threshold for manual inspection and the other defines a PR threshold for PR. We focused on finding the optimal values for the CM interval and inspection threshold, to minimize the expected cost per unit time. The optimal values of the decision variables generally exist, and are shown graphically as in Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 in our examples. It can be difficult to compute a general degradation process; therefore, some approximations were used. It would be as expected that two CM thresholds with additional manual inspections can effectively reduce the number of failures and the corresponding maintenance cost. The model proposed is a general model and can be applied to any system with CM and manual inspections. If the probability of dangerous failure is of primary concern, then availability or safety can be used as the objective function. (Dzwiarek & Hryniewicz, 2012). Future research can be expected in a number of directions, such as extending a two-stage failure process to a three-stage failure process with a further dividing of the delay-time into minor defective and severe defective stages, or recognizing that manual inspections can be imperfect, or considering spare part provisions.
