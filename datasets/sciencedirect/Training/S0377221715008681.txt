@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper studies strategic decentralization in binary choice composite network congestion games. A player decentralizes if she lets some autonomous agents to decide respectively how to send different parts of her stock from the origin to the destination. This paper shows that, with convex, strictly increasing and differentiable arc cost functions, an atomic splittable player always has an optimal unilateral decentralization strategy. Besides, unilateral decentralization gives her the same advantage as being the leader in a Stackelberg congestion game. Finally, unilateral decentralization of an atomic player has a negative impact on the social cost and on the costs of the other players at the equilibrium of the congestion game.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
This paper introduces strategic decentralization into composite network congestion games, and studies its properties in a specific subclass of such games. A player decentralizes her decision-making if she lets each of her deputies decide independently how to send the part of her stock deputed to him from its origin to its destination. A unilateral decentralization can be beneficial or deleterious for the decentralizing player herself, and it also has an influence on the other players’ utility and the social welfare as well. This paper provides a detailed analysis of these problems in the case where all the players have the same binary choice.In a network congestion game, i.e. routing game, each player has a certain quantity of stock and a finite set of choices. A choice is a directed, acyclic path from the player’s origin to her destination. A player with a stock of infinitesimal weight is nonatomic. She has to attribute her stock to only one choice. A player with a stock of strictly positive weight is atomic. She (more rigorously, her stock) is splittable if she can divide it into several parts and affect each part to a different choice. She can also be non splittable, which is the case originally studied in the seminal work of Rosenthal (1973) on congestion games. This paper considers only the splittable case so that the word splittable is often omitted. A path is composed of a series of arcs, and the cost of a path is the sum of the costs of its component arcs. The cost entailed to a user of an arc depends on the total weight of the stocks on it as well as on the quantity of that user’s stock on it. A player wishes to minimize her cost, which is the total cost to her stock. A game with both nonatomic and atomic players is called a composite game. An equilibrium in a composite congestion game is called a composite equilibrium (CE for short) (Boulogne, Altman, Kameda, & Pourtallier, 2002; Harker, 1988; Wan, 2012; Yang & Zhang, 2008). An equilibrium does not necessarily minimize the social cost, i.e. the total cost to all the players.In a composite congestion game, an atomic player of weight m decentralizes if she is replaced by a composite set of players called her deputies (i.e. n atomic players of weightα1,…,αnand a set of nonatomic players of total weight α0, such that∑i=0nαi=m) who have the same choice set as her, and she collects the sum of her deputies’ costs as her own.Here is an example of advantageous decentralization. Two atomic players both have a stock of weight12to send from O to D. Two parallel arcs link O to D, with per-unit cost functionc1(t)=t+10andc2(t)=10t+1respectively. At the equilibrium, both players send weight211on the first arc and722on the second one. The cost is 4.14 to both players and the social cost is 8.28. If player 1 deputes her stock to two atomic deputies both of weight14,then at the equilibrium of the resulting congestion game, both deputies send weight144on the first arc, while player 2 sends weight14there. The cost is 2.06 to both deputies of player 1. Hence player 1 gains by decentralizing because her current cost 4.12 is lower than 4.14. However, player 2’s cost is now 4.59 and the social cost is 8.71, both higher than before.Assuming that the arc cost functions are convex, strictly increasing and continuously differentiable in congestion, this paper obtains the following properties of unilateral decentralization in composite congestion games with binary choice or, equivalently, in a two-terminal two-parallel-arc composite routing game:(i)For the atomic player who decentralizes unilaterally, all her decentralization strategies are weakly dominated by single-atomic ones which depute her stock to at most one atomic deputies in addition to nonatomic ones (Theorem 2.1). A fortiori, she possesses an optimal decentralization strategy (Theorem 3.1), which depends on her relative size among all the players.Unilateral decentralization gives an atomic player the same advantage as being the leader in a Stackelberg congestion game (Theorem 3.2).After the unilateral decentralization of an atomic player, the social cost at the equilibrium increases or does not change, and the cost to each of her opponents increases or does not change (Theorem 4.1).Although the above results are obtained in the specific settingf of binary choice games, the goal of this paper is to introduce the notion of strategic decentralization into composite congestion games, to point out its significance, and to initiate a systematic study of its properties.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model, defines decentralization, and shows the special role of single-atomic decentralization strategies. Section 3 proves the existence of an optimal unilateral decentralization strategy, and shows that unilateral decentralization gives an atomic player the same advantage as being the leader in a Stackelberg congestion game. Section 4 focuses on the impact of unilateral decentralization on the social cost and the other players’ cost. Section 5 concludes. The proofs and auxiliary results are regrouped in Section 6.The “inverse” concept of decentralization – coalition formation or collusion between players – has been extensively studied. Hayrapetyan, Tardos, and Wexler (2006) first define the price of collusion (PoC) of a parallel network to be the ratio between the worst equilibrium social cost after the nonatomic players form disjoint coalitions and the worst equilibrium social cost without coalitions. Bhaskar, Fleischer, Huang, Eisenbrand, and Shepherd (2010) extended this study to series-parallel networks. (A series-parallel network can be constructed by merging in series or in parallel several graphs of parallel arcs.) This index is closely related to another important notion: the price of anarchy (PoA), which is introduced by Koutsoupias, Papadimitriou, Meinel, and Tison (1999) (and Papadimitriou, 2001) as the ratio between the worst equilibrium social cost and the minimal social cost in nonatomic games. Cominetti, Correa, and Stier-Moses (2009) derive the first bounds on the PoA with atomic players. For a specific network structure, one can deduce the PoC by the PoA with atomic players and the PoA with nonatomic players. Further results on the bound of the PoA with atomic players are obtained in Harks (2011), Roughgarden and Schoppmann (2011) and Bhaskar et al. (2010). Roughgarden and Tardos (2002) and Correa, Schulz, and Stier-Moses (2008) provide fundamental results on the bound of the PoA with nonatomic players. PoA in nonatomic games with asymmetric costs or elastic demands is studied in Perakis (2007) and Chau and Sim (2003), among others.Beyond the coalitions formed by nonatomic players, Cominetti et al. (2009), Altman et al. (2011), and Huang (2013) consider those formed by atomic players. Their results can be interpreted as the impact of certain kinds of collusion and hence, the “inverse” of it, decentralization, on the social cost. Wan (2012) studies the impact of coalition formation on the nonatomic players’ cost outside the coalition in parallel-link networks. In terms of the impact of coalition formation on the cost of the coalition members themselves, Cominetti et al. (2009), Altman et al. (2011) and Wan (2012) provide examples in different contexts of disadvantageous coalition formation for the members themselves. These are actually examples of advantageous decentralization. Finally, for works on strategic decentralization, one can cite Sorin and Wan (2013) in integer-splitting congestion games, and Baye, Crocker, and Ju (1996) in industrial organization (where they call the strategic decentralization of a firm “divisionalization”).Finally, let us point out that the above-mentioned coalition formation is studied by the approach of comparative statics in a noncooperative game setting. It is different from the cooperative routing games studied in Quant, Borm, and Reijnierse (2006) and Blocq and Orda (2014).In Fig. 1, nodes O and D are linked by two parallel arcs. The per-unit cost function of arc r is cr, forr=1,2. When the total weight of stocks on arc r is t, the cost to each unit of them is cr(t). Both c1 and c2 are defined on Ω, a neighborhood of[0,M¯],withM¯>0. They satisfy the following assumption throughout this paper.Assumption 1Both c1 and c2 are strictly increasing, convex and continuously differentiable on Ω, and non-negative on[0,M¯].There is a continuum of nonatomic players of total weight T0, and N atomic players of strictly positive weightT1,T2,…,TNrespectively, whereN∈N. If there are no nonatomic (resp. no atomic) players, thenT0=0(resp.N=0). LetI={0,1,…,N}. The player profile is denoted byT=(Ti)i∈I,and their total weight isM=∑i∈ITi,withM<M¯.The profile of the nonatomic players’ strategies is described by their flowx0=(x10,x20),wherexr0is the total weight of the nonatomic players on arc r. The strategy of atomic player i is specified by her flowxi=(x1i,x2i),wherexriis the weight that she sends by arc r. Callx=(xi)i∈Ithe (system) flow. Denote respectively byXi={xi∈R+2|x1i+x2i=Ti}the space of feasible flows for the nonatomic players or an atomic player i, and byX=∏i∈IXithe space of feasible system flows. Letξ=(ξr)r∈{1,2}be a vector function defined on X byξr(x)=∑i∈Ixri,i.e. the aggregate weight on arc r. For i ∈ I, letx−i=(xj)j∈I∖{i}.With flow x, the cost to a nonatomic player taking arc r is cr(ξr(x)). The cost to atomic player i isui(x)=x1ic1(ξ1(x))+x2ic2(ξ2(x)). The social cost isCS(x)=ξ1(x)c1(ξ1(x))+ξ2(x)c2(ξ2(x)).Let this composite congestion game be denoted by Γ(T). Flow x ∈ X is a composite equilibrium (CE) of Γ(T) if (Harker, 1988):(a)for r ∈ {1, 2}, ifxr0>0,then cr(ξr(x)) ≤ cs(ξs(x)) for all s ∈ {1, 2}; andfor i ∈ I∖{0}, ximinimizesui(·,x−i)on Xi.Like all composite congestion games taking place in a two-terminal parallel-arc networks, game Γ(T) always admits a unique CE. The reader is referred to Richman and Shimkin (2007) or Wan (2012) for a proof. For the uniqueness of equilibria in congestion games with different types of players and in more general networks, see, for example, Meunier and Pradeau (2014)Milchtaich (2005)Richman and Shimkin (2007) and (Bhaskar, Fleischer, Hoy, & Huang, 2015). Let the nonatomic players’ common cost at the unique CE x be denoted by u0(x).According to Assumption 1, there exists at most one numberξ^∈[0,M]such thatc1(ξ^)=c2(M−ξ^),and ξ exists if and only if c1(M) ≥ c2(0) and c2(M) ≥ c1(0).There are four possible cases concerning the relations between c1(0), c1(M), c2(0), c2(M) andξ^. Two of them are listed in the following assumption and studied in this paper.Assumption 2One of the following two conditions holds:(i)c1(M) < c2(0).c1(M) ≥ c2(0), c2(M) ≥ c1(0), and(1)ξ^c1′(ξ^)≥(M−ξ^)c2′(M−ξ^).The other two cases are symmetric to them: (iii) c2(M) < c1(0); (iv) c1(M) ≥ c2(0), c2(M) ≥ c1(0) andξ^c1′(ξ^)≤(M−ξ^)c2′(M−ξ^). One can prove that cases (i) and (ii) correspond to the situation where arc 1 is less costly than arc 2 at the CE x of any composite congestion game taking place in this network with the total weight of the players being M (cf. Lemma 6.1), whereas cases (iii) and (iv) correspond to the inverse.In composite congestion game Γ(T), an atomic player l of weight Tl decentralizes if she is replaced by a finite numbern∈Nof atomic players of weightα1,α2,…,αn(in a non-increasing order) and a continuum of nonatomic players of total weight α0 such that∑i=1nαi+α0=Tl. These nonatomic players of total weight α0 and the n atomic players are called her deputies. There can be only atomic or only nonatomic deputies.A (decentralization) strategy of atomic player l is a profileα=(α0,α1,…,αn)of her deputies. Atomic player l’s strategy space is denoted bySl=⋃n=0+∞Sl,n,whereSl,nis the set of strategies designating n atomic deputies:Sl,n={α=(α0,α1,…,αn)∈R+n+1|α1≥⋯≥αn>0;∑i=0nαi=Tl}.There are some specific classes of strategies worth noticing.•α is the nonatomic strategy, denoted byα, ifα0=Tlor, equivalently,n=0. It is the unique element inSl,0.α is the trivial strategy, denoted byα¯,ifn=1andα1=Tl. When playing this strategy, atomic player l does not decentralize.α is a single-atomic strategy (SA strategy for short), ifα=α̲,orn=1and α1 ∈ (0, Tl]. The set of SA strategies isSl,0∪Sl,1. An SA strategy is determined, and from now on also denoted, by the weight of the unique atomic deputy (if there is one) and 0 if there is none. The space of SA strategies is thus isometric to the closed interval SAl≔ [0, Tl]. The nonatomic strategy and the trivial strategy are both SA.This paper focuses on unilateral decentralization. Suppose that atomic player N decentralizes unilaterally. LetT−N={Tj}j=0N−1be the profile of atomic player N’s opponents.After player N decentralizes according to strategyα∈SN,the profile of the players in the network is denoted by(α,T−N). Rigorously, the player profile is(α0+T0,α1,…,αn,T1,…,TN−1). Instead of playing a congestion game against her opponentsT−Nby herself, atomic player N let her deputies do it, and autonomously, i.e. without any cooperation between them. This congestion gameΓ(α,T−N)is hence induced by N’s decentralization strategy α. Denote its unique CE byzα=((xi(zα))i=0n,(yj(zα))j=0N−1),withxi(zα)=(x1i(zα),x2i(zα))andyj(zα)=(y1j(zα),y2j(zα)). Atomic deputy of weight αisends weightxri(zα)on arc r, and nonatomic deputies of total weightxr0(zα)among α0 choose arc r. Letxr(zα)=∑i=0nxribe the total weight of atomic player N’s stock on arc r, whereasyr(zα)=∑j=0N−1yrjbe the aggregate weight of her opponents’ stock there. Still denote the aggregate weight on arc r by ξr(zα).Assume that the CE zαis always attained in congestion gameΓ(α,T−N). Player N’s cost for playing α is defined as the total cost to her deputies at zα:(2)UN(α,T−N)=x1(zα)c1(ξ1(zα))+x2(zα)c2(ξ2(zα)).Two decentralization strategies α andα˜inSNare equivalent with respect to the opponents’ profileT−Nif they yield the same cost to atomic player N:UN(α,T−N)=UN(α˜,T−N).In this paper, the equivalency between two decentralization strategies of N is always with respect toT−N,hence it is no longer specified.SA strategies play a special role among all the decentralization strategies.Theorem 2.1For any strategyα∈SN,there is an SA strategy s that is equivalent to α.Lemmas 6.4–6.7 give the subset of SA strategies equivalent to α.□This section investigates in the existence of an optimal decentralization strategy α of atomic player N, i.e. the one minimizingUN(α,T−N). Note that the space of decentralization strategies of N,SN=⋃n=0+∞SN,n,is the union of a countably infinite number of simplexes. Hence, the existence of an optimal strategy should not be taken for granted.According to Theorem 2.1, if N has an optimal decentralization strategy, there must be an equivalent SA strategy of her. Therefore, instead of studying the existence of an optimal strategy inSN,one need only focus on the space of SA strategies,SAN=[0,TN],which is a compact set inR. An optimal strategy thus exists if player N’s cost is continuous in her SA strategy on SAN.As the following theorem shows, an SA optimal strategy does exist and its explicit form depends on the relative weight of atomic player N among all the players. In particular, when M andT1,…,TN−1are fixed, three cases can be distinguished. They are respectively called nonatomic, trivial and nontrivial, according to the form of the SA optimal strategies.Theorem 3.1Atomic player N has an optimal decentralization strategy which minimizes her cost at the CE of the induced composite congestion game. More precisely, denotingH=c2(0)−c1(M)c1′(M), one has:1.(nonatomic). Every strategy of atomic player N is optimal and is equivalent to the nonatomic strategyα, if one of the two following holds:(1.1)H > 0 and either (i) Ti≤ H for all i ∈ I∖{0}, or (ii) N > 1,max1≤i≤N−1Ti>H,TN≤ C0.H ≤ 0 and either (i)∑i=1NTi≤C1, or (ii) N > 1,∑i=1N−1Ti>C1, and TN≤ C2.(trivial). Atomic player N’s unique optimal strategy is the trivial oneα¯, i.e. not decentralizing, if one of the two following holds:(2.1)H > 0, TN> H, andmax1≤i≤N−1Ti≤Hin the case that N > 1.H ≤ 0,N=1and TN> C1.(nontrivial). Atomic player N has at least one optimal strategy which is not necessarily nonatomic or trivial in the remaining situations.Some remarks on the profitability of strategic decentralization of atomic player N are necessary here. It is known (Orda, Rom, and Shimkin, 1993; Wan, 2012, also see Lemma 6.1) that smaller players are more likely to free ride by using the least costly arc(s). The bigger a player is, the more she tends to use the more expensive arc to internalize the negative externality of her choice on her own stock. Accordingly, as Theorem 3.1 shows, the optimal choice of atomic player N also depends on her relative size among all the players. In the nonatomic case, either atomic player N is too small compared with her atomic opponents, or all the players are small. Then, she can never change the outcome of the congestion game by unilateral decentralization, because she and her potential deputies always behave like free-riders. In the trivial case, atomic player N is very big compared to her opponents. If she decentralizes, she cannot free ride on them to her advantage because they are too small. Moreover, since her deputies are not internalizing enough their externalities, she actually loses by decentralizing. In the non trivial case, atomic player N is neither too small to be always a free-rider, nor big enough to be dominating. In this case, by some appropriate decentralization, she manages to free ride on her atomic opponents.Besides, let us point out that although the paper studies a one-person decision problem where atomic player N chooses how to decentralize, an alternative formulation of the problem as an extensive form game is also possible. By the definition of N’s costUN(α,T−N)induced by her choice α, the problem can be considered as a two-stage game called unilateral decentralization game. In the first stage, only N makes a move by choosing a decentralization strategy. In the second stage, her deputies created by this choice as well as the players inT−Nplay a composite congestion game. Then, an optimal decentralization strategy α of atomic player N and the corresponding CE zαinΓ(α,T−N)constitute a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the unilateral decentralization game. Theorem 3.1 shows that an SPNE exists in this game.However, this unilateral decentralization game is not precisely a Stackelberg game in the sense that the leader, atomic player N, moves in the first stage and the followers,T−N,move in the second stage. As a matter of fact, by decentralizing unilaterally in the first stage, player N creates new players, i.e. her deputies, who will participate in the second stage. Hence, while making her choice in the first stage, player N should anticipate not only the action of her opponentsT−Nbut also that of her own deputies in the second stage.This subsection compares the advantage of being able to decentralize unilaterally and that of being the leader in a Stackelberg congestion game. Stackelberg-type behavior in routing is studied in Karakostas and Kolliopoulos (2009)Korilis, Lazar, and Orda (1997)Roughgarden (2004)Yang, Zhang, and Meng (2007) and Bonifaci, Harks, and Schäfer (2010), etc.LetSΓ(TN,T−N)be the Stackelberg composite congestion game where atomic player N is the leader and the players inT−Nare the followers. In the first stage of the game, player N chooses how to distribute her flow on the two arcs. Then in the second stage, the followers choose how to distribute their flows. Let player N’s strategy in the first stage be denoted byx=(x1,x2)∈XN. Given x, the followers inT−Nplay a composite congestion game denoted byΓx(T−N)whose unique CE is denoted by Zx. LetΠN(x,T−N)denote player N’s cost at (x, Zx). Then a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the game is attained, if it exits, at(x*,Zx*)wherex*=argminx∈XNΠN(x,T−N).At the end of the previous subsection, the optimal unilateral decentralization problem is formulated as a two-stage game, where atomic player N is also the first mover. Although that game is not exactly a Stackelberg game asSΓ(TN,T−N),atomic player N has the same advantage as the first mover in both games, as the following theorem shows.Theorem 3.2Stackelberg gameSΓ(TN,T−N)admits an SPNE.Besides, by playing an optimal decentralization strategyα∈SN,atomic player N has the same costUN(α,T−N)as her SPNE cost in Stackelberg gameSΓ(TN,T−N).Obviously, player N cannot do worse in the Stackelberg game than in the unilateral decentralization game, because she can always do by herself what she anticipates her deputies to do. On the contrary, there can be a strategy (x1, x2) of player N in the Stackelberg game that cannot be “mimicked” by a decentralization strategy. In other words, no decentralization strategy α satisfies that, at the CE of the induced congestion game, the aggregate weight of player N’s deputies’ stock on arc r is exactly xr. However, such a strategy (x1, x2) cannot be optimal as the proof of the theorem shows.One should not deduce from Theorem 3.2 that the study of unilateral decentralization is useless because, once being the first mover, an atomic player need only do what her optimal deputies would have done. As pointed out in Sorin and Wan (2013), in a congestion game, a player’s choice has an influence on other players’ costs not via her identity (i.e. anonymously) but via the weight of her stock attributing to each particular choice. The behavior of decentralization is thus feasible in terms of strategies and undetectable to the others. These two features distinguish decentralization, as a strategic opportunity, from the first mover’s advantage in a Stackelberg congestion game.This section studies the impact of atomic player N’s unilateral decentralization on the other players’ costs and the social cost. Recall that the trivial decentralization strategyα¯corresponds to not decentralizing. Thus one has only to compare the cost to the players inT−Nand the social cost atzα¯with those at zα, for an arbitrary strategyα∈SN.Theorem 4.1Suppose that atomic player N decentralizes according to strategyα∈SN. Then at the CE of the induced congestion game, the social cost and the cost to each player inT−Nare not lower than at the CE of the congestion game without decentralization:(3)CS(zα)≥CS(zα¯)anduj(zα)≥uj(zα¯),∀j∈I∖{N}.In addition, equalities hold only in the nonatomic case, i.e. when the assumptions in the first case ofTheorem 3.1hold.Recall that the smaller a player is, the more she tends to free ride by using the less costly arc (cf. remark after Theorem 3.1) and exerts a higher externality on the other players. By decentralizing, atomic player N lets her deputies, who are smaller than her, free ride more aggressively. In other words, her deputies put more weight on the less costly arc, arc 1, than she herself would have done. Not only do these deputies of N increase the cost of the less expensive arc for its users, they also drive the others to put more weight on the more expensive arc, arc 2. In this way, the unilateral decentralization of N increases the social cost as well as her opponents’ costs.Meunier and Pradeau (2015, Theorem 3) recover a particular case of Theorem 4.1 concerning social cost and without nonatomic players. They show that in an atomic game taking place in a two-terminal two parallel-arc network with increasing, strictly convex and differentiable arc cost functions, if an atomic player i transfers some of her stock to a smaller atomic player j (Tj≤ Ti), then the social cost at the CE increases or remain constant after the transfer. In particular, when takingTj=0,this transfer of stock is equivalent to the decentralization of atomic player i who deputes her stock to two atomic deputies.This paper first introduces strategic decentralization behavior into composite congestion games. Then, in the particular setting of binary choice case, it shows (i) the existence of optimal unilateral decentralization which depends on the relative size of the decentralizing player, (ii) the “equivalence” between being the only player to decentralize and being the leader in a Stackelberg game, and (iii) the negative impacts of unilateral decentralization on the others.With more general network structure, Theorem 4.1 is no longer valid.In the setting of single OD (where all the players share the same origin and the same destination), Huang (2013) provides the following example adapted in our language. In the network shown on the left hand side of Fig. 2, the social cost at the unique equilibrium with two atomic players of weight 200 and 21 respectively increases when the atomic player of weight 21 deputes her stock to two atomic deputies of weight 20.9 and 0.1 respectively.Cominetti et al. (2009) provide the following example in a multiple OD game. The network is shown on the right hand side of Fig. 2. Only arcE−Fhas non constant cost function. A group of nonatomic players and an atomic player both have weight 1. The nonatomic group has OD pair (A, B) and available pathsA−BandA−E−F−B,while the atomic player has OD pair (C, D) and available pathsC−DandC−E−F−D. The social cost at the CE is 3.89. If the atomic player deputes her stock to a group of nonatomic players, the social cost at the new CE is 3.8, lower than 3.89. Altman et al. (2011) provide an example of multiple OD game, where the decentralization of an atomic player to several atomic deputies increases the social cost.These examples show that our result concerning the social cost can neither be extended to single OD games with more than two parallel arcs, nor to multiple OD games even if each OD pair is linked by two parallel arcs. The validity of the result concerning the opponents of the decentralizer remains an open question.Besides, this paper only considers unilateral decentralization. Decentralization games in which all the atomic players decentralize simultaneously are worth examining. Another potential extension follows Sorin and Wan (2013), where a deputy can also decentralize, and his deputies as well, and so on. In their case, a player has a finite integer weight and can only have deputies of integer weight. Therefore, sequential decentralization will terminate after a finite number of steps. In the setting of this paper, however, an atomic deputy of any size is able to decentralize. A possible approach consists in studying the asymptotic behavior of a sequential decentralization process. A first attempt to study one-shot simultaneous decentralization games as well as sequential decentralizing processes is made in Wan (2012), with two atomic players and affine arc cost functions.Without loss of generality, assume from now onT1≥T2≥⋯≥TN−1. DenoteM−N=∑i=0N−1Tithe total weight of atomic player N’s opponents. Denote byT[l]=∑j=1lTjthe total weight of the l largest atomic players inT−N,and letT[0]=0.Fix ϵ > 0. Functions h, a, and Fnforn∈Nare defined on Ω as follows:h(t)={c2(M−t)−c1(t)c1′(t),if0≤t≤M;h(0)−ϵt,ift<0;h(M)−ϵ(t−M),ift>M,a(t)={c2′(M−t)c1′(t),if0≤t≤M;a(0),ift<0;a(M),ift>M,Fn(t)=(M−t)(1+a(t))+nh(t),n∈N.H≜h(M),A≜a(ξ^).The following facts are derived from Assumption 1 and the above definition.(i)a is non-increasing, strictly positive and continuous on Ω.h and all Fn’s are strictly decreasing and continuous on Ω. Their inverse functionsh−1andFn−1are well defined on neighborhoods of [h(M), h(0)] and [Fn(M), Fn(0)] respectively, and are also strictly decreasing and continuous.Case (i) in Assumption 2 corresponds to H > 0, whereas case (ii) corresponds to H ≤ 0, h(0) ≥ 0 in addition to (1).h(ξ^)=0andFk(ξ^)=(M−ξ^)(1+A)=F0(ξ^)for all k.ξ^exists if and only if(4)H≤0,h(0)≥0.Recall a necessary and sufficient condition for x ∈ X to be the CE of composite congestion game Γ(T) (Harker, 1988): for all r ∈ {1, 2},(5)xr0>0⇒cr(ξr(x))=mins∈{1,2}cs(ξs(x)),(6)xri>0⇒cr(ξr(x))+xricr′(ξr(x))=mins∈{1,2}cs(ξs(x))+xsics′(ξs(x)),∀i∈I∖{0}.The following lemma regroups some important properties of the CE of an arbitrary composite congestion game with aggregate stockweight M.Lemma 6.1At the CE x of Γ(T), denote ξr(x) simply by ξr.1.For each arc r ∈ {1, 2},(1)ifxr0>0, thenxri>0for all atomic player i;if Ti≥ Tj for atomic players i and j, thenxri≥xrj, and equality holds if and only ifTi=Tjorxri=xrj=0;for all atomic player i and for s ≠ r, ifxri>0andxsi=0, then cr(ξr) < cs(ξs).c1(ξ1) ≤ c2(ξ2).If H ≤ 0 (i.e. c2(0) ≤ c1(M)), thenξ1≤ξ^.h(ξ1) ≥ 0 , and equality holds if and only if H ≤ 0 andξ1=ξ^.1.cf. Wan (2012).In the case H > 0 (c1(M) < c2(0)), c1(ξ1) ≤ c2(ξ2) is always true. In the case H ≤ 0, suppose c1(ξ1) > c2(ξ2). Ifξ1≤ξ^and thusM−ξ1≥M−ξ^,by the definition ofξ^,c1(ξ1)≤c1(ξ^)=c2(M−ξ^)≤c2(ξ2),contradicting the hypothesis that c1(ξ1) > c2(ξ2). Therefore,ξ1>ξ^≥0and, consequently,ξ2<M−ξ^. According to Assumptions 1 and 2,ξ1c1′(ξ1)>ξ^c1′(ξ^)≥(M−ξ^)c2′(M−ξ^)>ξ2c2′(ξ2). Thus,ξ1c1′(ξ1)>ξ2c2′(ξ2).Notice that N ≥ 1 because otherwiseT0=M,i.e. all the players are nonatomic and take the less expensive arc 2. Hence c1(0) > c2(M), contradicting Assumption 2. It follows from the hypothesis c1(ξ1) > c2(ξ2) and the first result of this lemma that there exists somel∈{1,…,N}such thatx1i>0,x2i>0for 1 ≤ i ≤ l and, if l < N,x1i=0,x2i=Tiforl+1≤i≤N. According to Eq. (6),(7)c1(ξ1)+x1ic1′(ξ1)=c2(ξ2)+x2ic2′(ξ2),∀1≤i≤l.Besides,x20=T0if T0 > 0 because of Eq. (5). Summing Eq. (7) leads tolc1(ξ1)+ξ1c1′(ξ1)=lc2(ξ2)+(ξ2−∑i=l+1NTi−T0)c2′(ξ2)≤lc2(ξ2)+ξ2c1′(ξ1),and equality holds if and only ifT0=0andl=N. But this is impossible because, by hypothesis, c1(ξ1) > c2(ξ2), andξ1c1′(ξ1)>ξ2c2′(ξ2).Thus, c1(ξ1) ≤ c2(ξ2).If c2(0) ≤ c1(M) andξ1>ξ^,then by Assumption 1,c1(ξ1)>c1(ξ^)=c2(M−ξ^)>c2(ξ2),which contradicts the fact that c1(ξ1) ≤ c2(ξ2).If c1(M) < c2(0) or, equivalently, H > 0, the fact that ξ1 ≤ M implies thath(ξ1)≥h(M)=H>0. If c2(0) ≤ c1(M), the fact thatξ1≤ξ^implies thath(ξ1)≥h(ξ^)=0,and the equality holds if and only ifξ1=ξ^.□For a decentralization strategy α, denoteα[k]=∑i=1kαi. Also, for the sake of simplicity, zαis often replaced by z, xr(zα) by xr,yrj(zα)byyrj,yr(zα) by yr, ξr(zα) by ξr, if no confusion can arise.Define four modes of zα, the CE of congestion gameΓ(α,T−N)as follows. They respectively correspond to: (1) All players put all their weight on arc 1; (2) Some atomic deputies of N put some weight on arc 2; (3) Some atomic players amongT−Nput some weight on arc 2, while all the deputies of N put all their weight on arc 1; (4) All the atomic players put weight both on arc 1 and arc 2, while there are nonatomic players on both arcs.The CE zαis of mode 1 (Table 1) if(8){c1(ξ1)<c2(ξ2);x1i=αi,0≤i≤n;y1j=Tj,0≤j≤N−1.The CE zαis of mode 2 specified byk∈N*andl∈{0,1,…,N−1}(Table 2), if(9){c1(ξ1)<c2(ξ2);1≤k≤n;x2i>0,1≤i≤k;x2i=0,i∈J1≜{k+1,…,n}∪{0},ifJ1≠∅;y2j>0,1≤j≤l,if1≤l≤N−1;y2j=0,j∈J2≜{l+1,…,N−1}∪{0},ifJ2≠∅.The CE zαis of mode 3 specified byl∈{1,…,N−1}(Table 3), if(10){c1(ξ1)<c2(ξ2);x2i=0,0≤i≤n;1≤l≤N−1;y2j>0,1≤j≤l;y2j=0,j∈J2≜{l+1,…,N−1}∪{0},ifJ2≠∅.The CE zαis of mode 4 (Table 4) if(11)c1(ξ1)=c2(ξ2).Lemma 6.2For allα∈SN,the CE zα takes one of the four modes above.According to Lemma 6.1, at zα, c1(ξ1) ≤ c2(ξ2), hence there are nonatomic players taking arc 2 only ifc1(ξ1)=c2(ξ2); besides, all the atomic players must put some weight on arc 1; also, if an atomic player put some weight on arc 2, then all the atomic players larger than her must do so as well. Hence, zαmust take one of the four modes above.□If two decentralization strategies α andα˜inSNare such that the total weight on arc 1 is the same at zα andzα˜,i.e.ξ1(zα)=ξ1(zα˜),then they are equivalent with respect toT−N.Denotezα˜byz˜,xr(z˜)byx˜r,yrj(z˜)byy˜rj,andξr(z˜)byξ˜r.Ifξ1=ξ˜1=ξ^,thenUN(α,T−N)=UN(α˜,T−N)=c1(ξ^).Ifξ1≠ξ^,theny10=T0,and according to Eq. (6), for each1≤j≤N−1,bothy1jandy˜1jsolve the following equation in w: Either w < Tj andc1(ξ1)+wc1′(ξ1)=c2(ξ2)+(Tj−w)c2′(ξ2),orw=Tjandc1(ξ1)+wc1′(ξ1)≤c2(ξ2)+(Tj−w)c2′(ξ2). There is only one solution to this equation, hencey1j=y˜1j. Similarly,y10=y˜10. Thereforex1=x˜1andUN(α,T−N)=UN(α˜,T−N).□1.If zα is of mode 1, then(12)x1=TN,y1=M−N,ξ1=M.There exists a strategyα∈SNsuch that zα is of mode 1 if and only if(13)H>0;T1≤HifN>1.AssumeEq. (13). Define a subset ofSNby:S1N={α∈SN|α=α̲,orα1≤H}.Then,α∈S1Nif and only if zα is of mode 1. Furthermore, all the strategies inS1Nare equivalent to each other with respect toT−N.In particular, the nonatomic strategyαis inS1N.Sinceξ1=Mand c1(ξ1) < c2(ξ2), one has c1(M) < c2(0) or, equivalently, H > 0. If N ≥ 2, then it follows from Eq. (6) that, for1≤j≤N−1,c1(M)+Tjc1′(M)≤c2(0)or, equivalently, Tj≤ H. Similarly, if n ≥ 1, then for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, αi≤ H.□1.If zα is of mode 2 specified by k and l, then(14)x1i=αia(ξ1)+h(ξ1)1+a(ξ1),1≤i≤k;x1=TN−α[k]−kh(ξ1)1+a(ξ1);(15)y1j=Tja(ξ1)+h(ξ1)1+a(ξ1),1≤j≤l;y1=M−N−T[l]−lh(ξ1)1+a(ξ1);(16)ξ1=M−α[k]+T[l]−(k+l)h(ξ1)1+a(ξ1)=Fk+l−1(α[k]+T[l]).In particular, if l ≥ 1, then for all 1 ≤ j ≤ l, Tj> h(ξ1).For givenk∈N*andl∈{0,…,N−1}, there exists a strategyα∈SNsuch that zα is of mode 2 specified by k and l if and only if(17){Fl−1(T[l])>h−1(Tl)ifl≥1;TN>kh(Fl−1(T[l]));TN≥Fk+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]ifN≥l+2;TN>F0(ξ^)−T[l]ifH≤0.For givenk∈N*andl∈{0,…,N−1}, assumeEq. (17). Given a real constant w such that(18){0<w≤TN;w>kh(Fl−1(T[l]));w<Fk+l(h−1(Tl))−T[l]ifl≥1;w≥Fk+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]ifl≤N−1;w>F0(ξ^)−T[l]ifH≤0,denoteη1=Fk+l−1(w+T[l]), and define a subset ofSNby:S2N(w,T−N;k,l)={α∈SN|n≥k;α[k]=w;∀1≤i≤k,αi>h(η1);∀k+1≤i≤n,αi≤h(η1)}.Then,α∈S2N(w,T−N;k,l)if and only if it induces zα of mode 2 specified by k and l and, at zα, the total weight on arc 1, ξ1(zα), is η1. Furthermore, the strategies inS2N(w,T−N;k,l)are equivalent to each other.SA strategyw−(k−1)h(η1)is equivalent to the strategies inS2N(w,T−N;k,l).Let us prove for the case that l ≥ 1. The case thatl=0is similar.1.For 1 ≤ i ≤ k, Eq. (6) implies thatc1(ξ1)+x1ic1′(ξ1)=c2(ξ2)+x2ic2′(ξ2)or, equivalently,x1i=αia(ξ1)+h(ξ1)1+a(ξ1). Similarly, for 1 ≤ j ≤ l,y1j=Tja(ξ1)+h(ξ1)1+a(ξ1).The rest of the results in Eqs. (14)–(16), can then be easily obtained. In particular,(19)Fk+l(ξ1)=α[k]+T[l].SinceFk+lis strictly decreasing,ξ1=Fk+l−1(α[k]+T[l]).For 1 ≤ i ≤ k, the fact thatx1i=αia(ξ1)+h(ξ1)1+a(ξ1)and0<x1i<αiyields (i)αi>−h(ξ1)/a(ξ1),which is always true, because h(ξ1) ≥ 0 and a(ξ1) > 0; and (ii)(20)αi>h(ξ1).Similarly as for Eq. (20), one has Tj> h(ξ1) for all 1 ≤ j ≤ l.Four constraints on ξ1 can be deduced.(i)Eq. (20) implies(21)α[k]>kh(ξ1)or, equivalently, according to Eq. (19),Fk+l(ξ1)=(M−ξ1)(1+a(ξ1))+(k+l)h(ξ1)>kh(ξ1)+T[l]⇒Fl(ξ1)=(M−ξ1)(1+a(ξ1))+lh(ξ1)>T[l]. Therefore,ξ1<Fl−1(T[l]).The fact that Tj> h(ξ1) for all 1 ≤ j ≤ l impliesξ1>h−1(Tl).Ifl<N−1,then forl+1≤j≤N−1,according to Eq. (6),c1(ξ1)+Tjc1′(ξ1)≤c2(ξ2)or equivalently Tj≤ h(ξ1), which further impliesξ1≤h−1(Tl+1).If H ≤ 0, then according to Lemma 6.1,ξ1<ξ^.These four constraints on ξ1 (i.e.ξ1<Fl−1(T[l]),ξ1>h−1(Tl),ξ1≤h−1(Tl+1)andξ1<ξ^) together with Eq. (20), Eq. (19) and Eq. (21) imply that(22)TN≥α[k]>kh(ξ1)>kh(Fl−1(T[l]));(23)α[k]=Fk+l(ξ1)−T[l]<Fk+l(h−1(Tl))−T[l];(24)TN≥α[k]=Fk+l(ξ1)−T[l]≥Fk+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l],ifl<N−1;(25)TN≥α[k]=Fk+l(ξ1)−T[l]≥F0(ξ^)−T[l],ifH≤0.Eqs. (22)–(25) yield Eq. (18).Besides, Eqs. (22) and (23) imply thatkh(Fl−1(T[l]))<Fk+l(h−1(Tl))−T[l]⇒T[l]+kh(Fl−1(T[l]))<Fl(h−1(Tl))+kTl⇒Fl−1(T[l])>h−1(Tl).This result, together with Eqs. (22)–(25), proves Eq. (17).If n > k, then fork+1≤i≤n,according to Eq. (6),c1(ξ1)+αic1′(ξ1)≤c2(ξ2)or, equivalently, αi≤ h(ξ1).In five steps, let us show that, if the conditions in Eq. (17) and those in Eq. (18) are satisfied for k and w, then they are also satisfied when k is replaced by 1, and w is replaced byw−(k−1)h(η1).(1)Ifh(Fl−1(T[l]))<0,thenTp≥w>h(Fl−1(T[l])). Ifh(Fl−1(T[l]))>0,TN≥w>kh(Fl−1(T[l]))>h(Fl−1(T[l])).Ifl<N−1,thenTN≥Fk+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]=F1+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]+(k−1)Tl+1≥F1+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l],where the second inequality is due to the fact that k ≥ 1.The fact thatη1>h−1(Tl)implies thatF1+l(η1)<F1+l(h−1(Tl)). Besides, by the definition of η1,w−(k−1)h(η1)=Fk+l(η1)−T[l]−(k−1)h(η1)=F1+l(η1)−T[l]. Therefore,w−(k−1)h(η1)<F1+l(h−1(Tl))−T[l].Ifl<N−1,the relationη1≤h−1(Tl+1)implies thatF1+l(η1)≥F1+l(h−1(Tl+1)). As a result,w−(k−1)h(η1)=F1+l(η1)−T[l]≥F1+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l].If H ≤ 0, the relationη1≤η^implies thatw−(k−1)h(η1)=F1+l(η1)−T[l]≥F0(η^)−T[l].Therefore, the CEzw−(k−1)h(η1)induced by SA strategyw−(k−1)h(η1)is of mode 3 specified by 1 and l. The definition of η1 implies thatw+T[l]=Fk+l(η1)=F1+l(η1)+(k−1)h(η1). Hence,w−(k−1)h(η1)+T[l]=F1+l(η1)or, equivalently,η1=F1+l−1(w−(k−1)h(η1)). According to Eq. (16), the total weight on arc 1 atzw−(k−1)h(η1)is also η1, which means that SA strategyw−(k−1)h(η1)is equivalent to the strategies inS2p(w,T−N;k,l),by applying Lemma 6.3.□1.If zα is of mode 3 and specified by l, then(26)x1=TN;y1j=Tja(ξ1)+h(ξ1)1+a(ξ1),1≤j≤l;y1=M−N−T[l]−lh(ξ1)1+a(ξ1);(27)ξ1=M−T[l]−lh(ξ1)1+a(ξ1)=Fl−1(T[l]).In particular, for all 1 ≤ j ≤ l, Tj> h(ξ1).If N > 1, for givenl∈N*and l < N, there exists a strategyα∈SNsuch that zα is of mode 3 and specified by l if and only if(28){Fl−1(T[l])>h−1(Tl);Fl−1(T[l])≤h−1(Tl+1)ifl≤N−2;T[l]>F0(ξ^)ifH≤0.If N > 1, for givenl∈N*and l < N, assumeEq. (28). Define a subset ofSNby:S3N(T−N;l)={α∈SN|α=α̲,orα1≤h(Fl−1(T[l]))}.Then,α∈S3N(T−N;l)if and only if it induces zα of mode 3 specified by l and, at zα, the total weight on arc 1 isFl−1(T[l]). Furthermore, the strategies inS3N(T−N;l)are equivalent to each other.In particular, the nonatomic strategyαis inS3N(T−N;l).Similar to the proof of Lemma 6.5.□1.If zα is of mode 4, then(29)x1i=Aαi1+A,1≤i≤n,ifn≥1;y1j=ATj1+A,1≤j≤N−1,ifN>1;ξ1=ξ^.There exists a strategyα∈SNsuch that zα is of mode 4 if and only if(30)H≤0;T[N−1]≤F0(ξ^),ifN>1.AssumeEq. (30). Define a subset ofSNby:S4N={α=(αi)i=0n∈SN|α=α̲,orα[n]≤F0(ξ^)−T[N−1]}.Thenα∈S4Nif and only if zα is of mode 4. Furthermore, the strategies inS4Nare equivalent to each other.In particular, the nonatomic strategyαis inS4N.Since the two arcs have equal cost,ξ1=ξ^and, according to Eq. (4), H ≤ 0. Flows Eq. (29) can be deduced from Eq. (6). And they imply that(31)x10+y10=ξ1−∑inx1i−∑jN−1y1j=ξ^−A(α[n]+T[N−1])1+A.It follows from0≤x10≤α0and0≤y10≤T0that0≤x10+y10≤TN−α[n]+M−N−T[N−1]=M−α[n]−T[N−1]. One deduces, by considering Eq. (31), thatα[n]+T[N−1]≤ξ^·1+AAandα[n]+T[N−1]≤(M−ξ^)(1+A). But,ξ^·1+AA≥(M−ξ^)(1+A)because(M−ξ^)(1+A)≤M≤ξ^1+AA,which is itself due to Eq. (1). Therefore,α[n]+T[N−1]≤(M−ξ^)(1+A)=F0(ξ^).□Lemma 6.8Suppose thatα,α˜∈SNare two decentralization strategies of atomic player N, andzα,zα˜respectively the CE of gameΓ(α,T−N)andΓ(α˜,T−N). If zα is of mode 2, andx1(zα˜)>x1(zα),y1(zα˜)≥y1(zα),thenUN(α˜,T−N)>UN(α,T−N).Denote zαby z,zα˜byz˜,xr(z) by xr,xr(z˜)byx˜r,yr(z) by yr,yr(z˜)byy˜r,ξr(z) by ξrandξr(z˜)byξ˜r.Suppose that x is specified byk∈N*(andl∈N*in the case that x is of mode 2). According to Eq. (6),(32)c1(ξ1)+x1ic1′(ξ1)=c2(ξ2)+x2ic2′(ξ2),1≤i≤k.Summing Eq. (32) leads tokc1(ξ1)+[x1−(TN−α[k])]c1′(ξ1)=kc2(ξ2)+x2c2′(ξ2). Consequently,c1(ξ1)+x1c1′(ξ1)=c2(ξ2)+x2c2′(ξ2)+(k−1)[c2(ξ2)−c1(ξ1)]+(TN−α[k])c1′(ξ1). Since c1(ξ1) ≤ c2(ξ2) by Lemma 6.1, one deduces thatc1(ξ1)+x1c1′(ξ1)≥c2(ξ2)+x2c2′(ξ2). Moreover, there exists B > 0 such that(33)c1(ξ1)+x1c1′(ξ1)≥B≥c2(ξ2)+x2c2′(ξ2).Assumption 1, Eq. (33) and the fact thatc1(ξ˜1)≤c2(ξ˜2)(still by Lemma 6.1) imply that, for alls∈(x1,x˜1]andt∈[x˜2,x2),(34)c1(s+y1)+sc1′(s+y1)>B>c2(t+y2)+tc2′(t+y2),c1(s+y1)≤c1(ξ˜1)≤c2(ξ˜2)≤c2(t+y2).They further imply thatsc1′(s+y1)>tc2′(t+y2)and, moreover, there exists C > 0 such that for anyp∈(y1,M−N]and q ∈ [0, y2),(35)sc1′(s+p)>C>tc2′(t+q).Let us compareUN(α˜,T−N)andUN(α,T−N):UN(α˜,T−N)−UN(α,T−N)=[x˜1c1(ξ˜1)+x˜2c2(ξ˜2)]−[x1c1(ξ1)+x2c2(ξ2)]=[x˜1c1(ξ˜1)−x˜1c1(x˜1+y1)]+[x˜1c1(x˜1+y1)−x1c1(ξ1)]−[x˜2c2(x˜2+y2)−x˜2c2(ξ˜2)]−[x2c2(ξ2)−x˜2c2(x˜2+y2)]=∫y1y˜1x˜1c1′(x˜1+s)ds+∫x1x˜1[c1(s+y1)+sc1′(s+y1)]ds−∫y˜2y2x˜2c2′(x˜2+t)dt−∫x˜2x2[c2(t+y2)+tc2′(t+y2)]dt>(y˜1−y1)C+(x˜1−x1)B−(y2−y˜2)C−(x2−x˜2)B=0,where the inequality is due to Eqs. (34) and (35).□Forl=0(if N > 1) and for1≤l≤N−2(if N > 2), defineBl=Fl+1(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l].Suppose that either (i) H > 0, N > 1 and T1 > H, or (ii) H ≤ 0, N ≥ 2,T[N−1]≥F0(ξ^). Then,1.The CE zαinduced by atomic player N’s nonatomic strategyαis of mode 3 specified by l0, l0being the unique number in{1,…,N−1}that meets the conditions inEq. (28).(36)F1−1(T[1])>F2−1(T[2])>⋯>Fl0−1(T[l0]);(37)Fl−1(T[l])>h−1(Tl),1≤l≤l0.Ifl0<N−1, then(38)Fl0−1(T[l0])≤Fl0+1−1(T[l0+1])≤⋯≤FN−1−1(T[N−1]),ifl0>1;(39)Fl−1(T[l])≤h−1(Tl),l0+1≤l≤N−1.For allk∈N,(40)Fk+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]{>kh(Fl−1(T[l])),ifl0>1and1≤l≤l0−1,≤kh(Fl−1(T[l])),ifl0<N−1andl=l0.In particular, if l0 > 1, thenBl>h(Fl−1(T[l]))for all1≤l≤l0−1.If l0 > 1, then for allk∈Nand1≤l≤l0−1,Fk+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]>kh(Fl0−1(T[l0])).If l0 > 1, thenB0≥B1≥⋯≥Bl0−1. Forl∈{1,…,l0−1},Bl=Bl−1if and only ifTl+1=Tl.Bl0−1>h(Fl0−1(T[l0])).For all strategyα∈SN, one and only one of the following is true:(i)zα is of mode 3 and specified by l0; besides, α is equivalent toα.zα is of mode 2 and specified by somek∈N*and somel∈{0,1,…,l0}.Denote zαsimply byz.1.The CEzis not of mode 1 when H > 0 because of Eq. (13), and is not of mode 4 when H ≤ 0 because of Eq. (30). It is not of mode 2 becausen=0. Thus, it is of mode 3. Lemma 6.6 shows thatzmust be specified by some uniquel0∈{1,…,N−1}satisfying Eq. (28).One has only to prove for the case where N > 2. First, suppose thatl0<N−1. Let us prove Eqs. (38) and (39) by induction.The fact thatl0≠N−1implies thatN−1does not meet all the four conditions in Eq. (28). However, in this case, only the second condition can be violated. Thus,FN−1−1(T[N−1])≤h−1(TN−1). Now, suppose that for somel∈{l0+1,…,N−1},Fl−1(T[l])≤Fl+1−1(T[l+1])≤⋯≤FN−1−1(T[N−1]);Fp−1(T[p])≤h−1(Tp),∀p∈{l,…,N−1}.The relationFl−1(T[l])≤h−1(Tl)implies thath(Fl−1(T[l]))≥Tland, consequently,T[l]=Fl(Fl−1(T[l]))=Fl−1(Fl−1(T[l]))+h(Fl−1(T[l]))≥Fl−1(Fl−1(T[l]))+Tl. This implies thatT[l−1]≥Fl−1(Fl−1(T[l]))and, as a consequence,Fl−1−1(T[l−1])≤Fl−1(T[l])≤h−1(Tl). In particular,Fl−1−1(T[l−1])≤Fl−1(T[l])andFl−1−1(T[l−1])≤h−1(Tl).IfFl−1−1(T[l−1])>h−1(Tl−1),then all the conditions in Eq. (28) are satisfied so thatl0=l−1. Otherwise, one continues the induction by consideringl−1. In this way, Eqs. (38) and (39) are proved.Next, let us prove Eqs. (36) and (37) by induction.According to Eq. (28),Fl0−1(T[l0])>h−1(Tl0). Suppose that l0 > 1 and, for somel∈{2,…,l0},Fl−1(T[l])>Fl+1−1(T[l+1])>⋯>Fl0−1(T[l0]);Fp−1(T[p])>h−1(Tp),∀p∈{l,…,l0}.IfFl−1−1(T[l−1])≤Fl−1(T[l]),thenFl−1(Fl−1−1(T[l−1]))≥Fl−1(Fl−1(T[l])),i.e.T[l−1]≥Fl(Fl−1(T[l]))−h(Fl−1(T[l]))=T[l]−h(Fl−1(T[l]))which impliesh(Fl−1(T[l]))≥Tlor equivalentlyFl−1(T[l])≤h−1(Tl). It contradicts the hypothesis thatFl−1(T[l])>h−1(Tl). Therefore,Fl−1−1(T[l−1])>Fl−1(T[l]). Furthermore,Fl−1−1(T[l−1])>Fl−1(T[l])>h−1(Tl)≥h−1(Tl−1). These prove Eqs. (36) and (37).For allk∈N,(41)Fk+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]−kh(Fl−1(T[l]))=Fl(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]+k[Tl+1−h(Fl−1(T[l]))]×{>0,ifh−1(Tl+1)<Fl−1(T[l]),≤0,ifh−1(Tl+1)≥Fl−1(T[l]).If l0 > 1, then, for alll∈{1,…,l0−1},Eqs. (36) and (37) show thatFl−1(T[l])>Fl+1−1(T[l+1])>h−1(Tl+1). If l0 < m, then, according to Eq. (28),Fl0−1(T[l0])≤h−1(Tl0+1). These two inequalities and Eq. (41) lead to the conclusion.On the one hand, forl∈{1,…,l0−1},it is proven in the previous statement thatFl−1(T[l])>h−1(Tl+1)and, consequently,T[l]<Fl(h−1(Tl+1)). On the other hand, Eq. (28) implies thath−1(Tl0)>Fl0−1(T[l0])or equivalentlyTl0<h(Fl0−1(T[l0])),thus,Tl+1>h(Fl0−1(T[l0]))≥Tl0.These two results imply thatFk+l(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]−kh(Fl0−1(T[l0]))=Fl(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]+k[Tl+1−h(Fl0−1(T[l0]))]>0,which concludes.Forl∈{0,…,l0−2},Bl−Bl+1=[Fl+1(h−1(Tl+1))−T[l]]−[4][Fl+2(h−1(Tl+2))−T[l+1]]=[Fl+2(h−1(Tl+1))−Tl+1−T[l]]−[Fl+2(h−1(Tl+2))−T[l]−Tl+1]=Fl+2(h−1(Tl+1))−Fl+2(h−1(Tl+2))≥0,becauseTl+1≥Tl+2. Clearly, equality holds if and only ifTl+1=Tl+2.According to Eq. (28),Fl0−1(T[l0])>h−1(Tl0)or equivalentlyT[l0]<Fl0(h−1(Tl0)). Hence,Fl0(h−1(Tl0))>T[l0]=T[l0−1]+Tl0>T[l0−1]+h(Fl0−1(T[l0]))and, consequently,Bl0−1=Fl0(h−1(Tl0))−T[l0−1]>h(Fl0−1(T[l0])).Given an arbitrary strategyα∈Sp. Because T1 > H in the case where H > 0, andT[N−1]≥F0(ξ^)in the case where H ≤ 0, zαcannot be of mode 1 or mode 4 according to Lemmas 6.4 and 6.7. If zαis of mode 3 and specified by l, then l meets the conditions in Eq. (28), i.e.l=l0. If zαis of mode 2 and specified by k and l, thenFl−1(T[l])>h−1(Tl)by Eq. (17). According to Eqs. (37) and (39),l∈{1,…,l0}.□Suppose that one of the following holds:(i)H > 0, TN≤ H, and T1 ≤ H if N > 1;H>0,N>1,T1>H,TN≤h(Fl0−1(T[l0])),where l0is the one inLemma 6.9;H ≤ 0,TN+T[N−1]≤F0(ξ^);H ≤ 0, N ≥ 2,T[N−1]>F0(ξ^),TN≤h(Fl0−1(T[l0])),where l0is the one inLemma 6.9. Then,1.All the strategies inSNare equivalent to the nonatomic strategyα. In particular, every strategy of atomic player N is optimal.For all SA strategy s ∈ [0, TN],zs=zα¯, the CE induced by the trivial strategyα¯or equivalently the CE of the original game Γ(T) without decentralization.zαis of mode 1 in case (i), of mode 4 in case (iii), and of mode 3 and specified by l0in cases (ii) and (iv).The results follow from Lemmas 6.4, 6.6, 6.7 and 6.9 (2).□Suppose that either (i) H > 0, TN> H, and T1 ≤ H if N > 1, or (ii) H ≤ 0,N=1andTN>F0(ξ^). Then1.zα¯is of mode 2 specified by 1 and 0.Atomic player N’s unique optimal decentralization strategy is the trivial oneα¯, i.e. not decentralizing.For SA strategies s ∈ [0, TN], ξ1(zs) and x1(zs) are continuous and non-increasing in s, and y1(zs) is continuous and non-decreasing in s.Denotezα¯byz¯,xr(z¯)byx¯r,yr(z¯)byy¯r,andξr(z¯)byξ¯r. Consider the case H > 0 only. The proof for the case H ≤ 0 is similar.1.For any strategyα∈SN,zαcannot be of mode 4, because H > 0. It cannot be of mode 2 specified byk∈N*andl∈N*or mode 3 because, otherwiseT1>h(ξ1(zα))>h(M)=Haccording to Lemmas 6.5 and 6.6. Therefore, zαis of mode 1 or mode 2 specified by somek∈N*and 0.For any α such that zαis of mode 2 specified by somek∈N*and 0, it follows from Lemma 6.5 that there exists some w ∈ (0, TN] satisfying the conditions in Eq. (18) so thatα∈S2N(w,T−N;k,0). Clearly,α¯is inS2N(TN,T−N;1,0). Thus,z¯is of mode 2 specified by 1 and 0. Lemma 6.5, Eqs. (14) and (15) implyx¯1=TN−TN−h(ξ¯1)1+a(ξ¯1)<TN,y¯1=M−Nandξ¯1=F1−1(TN).According to Lemma 6.4, zαis of mode 1 if and only ifα∈S1N,i.e.α=α̲or α1 ≤ H. In particular, an SA strategy s is inS1Nif and only if s ≤ H. Fix a strategyα∈S1N. Then,x1(zα)=TN,y1(zα)=M−Nandξ1(zα)=Mby Eq. (12). Sincex1(zα)>x¯1andy1(zα)=y¯1,it follows from Lemma 6.8 thatUN(α,T−N)>UN(α¯,T−N). In other words, no strategy inS1Nis optimal. In addition, for all s ∈ [0, H],ξ(zs)=M,x1(zs)=TNandy0j(zs)=Tjfor0≤j≤N−1,i.e. they are all constant in s.Now consider an SA strategy s ∈ (H, TN]. It is not inS1N,hence zsis of mode 2 specified by 1 and 0. The total weight on arc 1 at zsisξ1(zs)=F1−1(s)by Lemma 6.5. By abuse of notation, define two functions of s, ξ1 and x1, by ξ1(s)≜ξ1(zs) and x1(s)≜x1(zs). Since F1 is strictly decreasing, a bijection θ can be defined from interval (H, TN], the domain of s, to interval[F1−1(TN),M),the domain of ξ1, such thatθ=F1−1andθ−1=F1. Then, atomic player N’s costUN(s,T−N),as a function of s, can be written as a function v of ξ1 on[F1−1(TN),M):v(ξ1)=UN(θ−1(ξ1),T−N)=UN(F1(ξ1),T−N).According to Eq. (14),x1=TN−F1(ξ1)−h(ξ1)1+a(ξ1)=TN−M+ξ1. Then, for allξ1∈[F1−1(TN),M),v(ξ1)=x1c1(ξ1)+(TN−x1)c2(M−ξ1)=(TN−M+ξ1)c1(ξ1)+(M−ξ1)c2(M−ξ1).Its derivative function isv′(ξ1)=c1(ξ1)+(TN−M+ξ1)c1′(ξ1)−c2(M−ξ1)−(M−ξ1)c2′(M−ξ1)=c1′(ξ1)(TN−F1(ξ1))=c1′(ξ1)(TN−s)≥0and equality holds if and only ifs=TNor, equivalently,ξ1=F1−1(TN).Therefore, v(ξ1) attains its unique minimum on interval[F1−1(TN),M)atF1−1(TN),and it is strictly increasing on[F1−1(TN),M). As a result, the trivial strategyα¯is optimal, and it is the unique SA strategy that is optimal.Let us show thatα¯is the unique optimal strategy. Recall that no strategy inS1Nis optimal, hence it is enough to show that no strategy inSN∖S1Nother thanα¯is optimal. Given an arbitraryα∈SN∖S1N,suppose that it is inS2N(w,T−N;k,0)for some w ∈ (0, TN] andk∈N*. According to Lemma 6.5, α is equivalent to SA strategyw−(k−1)h(η1),whereη1=Fk−1(w). If SA strategyw−(k−1)h(η1)<TN,then α is not optimal. Ifw−(k−1)h(η1)=TN,then α induces the same aggregate weight on arc 1 asα¯,i.e.η1=F1−1(TN). As a result,w=TN+(k−1)h(F1−1(TN)). On the one hand,F1−1(TN)<Mand, consequently,h(F1−1(TN))>h(M)=H>0. It follows thatw=TN+(k−1)h(F1−1(TN))≥TN,and equality holds if and only ifk=1. On the other hand, w ≤ TN. Therefore,k=1andw=TN,and α is justα¯.It is already shown that for s ∈ [0, H], ξ, x1(zs) and y1(zs) are all constant in s. For s ∈ (0, H], recall thatξ1(zs)=F−1(s),andy1(zs)=M−Nby Lemma 6.5. Thus ξ1(zs) is strictly decreasing in s, y1(zs) is constant. Consequently,x1(zs)=ξ1(zs)−y1(zs)is strictly increasing in s.□In the cases not treated inLemmas 6.10and6.11, one has the following.1.Atomic player N has at least one optimal decentralization strategy.Ifα∈SNis optimal, then zα can be of mode 3 specified by l0, or of mode 2 specified by somek∈N*and somel∈{0,1,…,l0}.For SA strategy s ∈ [0, TN], ξ1(zs) and x1(zs) are continuous and non-increasing in s, and y1(zs) is continuous and non-decreasing in s.The proof follows arguments similar to those in the previous proof, but much longer. It is omitted to save space.Proof of Theorem 3.1The result follows from Lemmas 6.10–6.12, which treat the three cases respectively. For the nontrivial case, Lemma 6.12 shows thatU(s,T−N)is a continuous function in SA strategy s on [0, TN], hence a minimizer exists.□Consider SA strategiess∈SAN=[0,TN]and the corresponding CE zs in the induced gameΓ(s,T−N). Both ξ1(zs) and x1(zs) are non-increasing in s, whereas y1(zs) is non-decreasing in s.It is a straightforward corollary of Lemmas 6.10–6.12.□According to Theorem 2.1, it is sufficient to prove(42)infx∈XNΠN(x,T−N)=mins∈SANUN(s,T−N),and the minimizer on the left hand side exists and is unique.First show thatinfx∈XNΠN(x,T−N)≤mins∈SANUN(s,T−N). Indeed, for any s ∈ SAN, recall that the aggregate flow of the deputies of atomic player N at zsisx(zs)=(xr(zs))r=12,and the flows of the players inT−Narey(zs)=((yrl(zs))r=12)l=0N−1. In Stackelberg gameSΓ(TN,T−N),by playing strategy x(zs), the CE of the induced composite congestion gameΓx(zs)(T−N),Zx(zs),is just y(zs). This is because at(x(zs),Zx(zs))and at zs, the flows of the players inT−Nsatisfy the same equilibrium condition and such flows are unique. Thus,ΠN(x(zs),T−N)=UN(s,T−N)and, consequently,infx∈XNΠN(x,T−N)≤mins∈SANUN(s,T−N).Next show thatinfx∈XNΠN(x,T−N)≥mins∈SANUN(s,T−N). For all decentralization strategy s ∈ S AN, letzs′=(x(zs),y(zs))be the semi-aggregate flow induced by zsby considering only the aggregate flow of atomic player N’s deputies. Now in Stackelberg gameSΓ(TN,T−N),for an arbitrary strategy x ∈ XNof the leader atomic player N, if it induces a CE Zxin the composite congestion gameΓx(T−N)such that(x,Zx)=zs′for some s ∈ SAN, thenΠN(x,T−N)=UN(s,T−N)≥mint∈SANUN(t,T−N). Suppose that there exists x ∈ XNsuch that no s ∈ SANsatisfy(x,Zx)=zs′. Let us show thatΠN(x,T−N)is not lower thanUN(α¯,T−N),the cost to atomic player N when she plays the trivial decentralization strategyα¯. In other words, such a strategy cannot be strictly better than xN, with xNbeing N’s flow at the CE x of congestion game Γ(T).For the sake of simplicity, denotezα¯byz¯,xr(zα¯)byx¯r,yrj(zα¯)byy¯rj,yr(zα¯)byy¯r,andξr(zα¯)byξ¯r; besides, denote by ξrthe total weight on arc r at (x, Zx), and byyj=(yrj)r=12the flow of atomic player j or that of the nonatomic players inT−Nat (x, Zx).Ifξ1=ξ¯1=ξ^,thenΠN(x,T−N)=UN(α¯,T−N)=TNc(ξ^). Ifξ1=ξ¯1≠ξ^,then by the proof of Lemma 6.3,x1=x¯1andy1j=y¯1j,0≤j≤N−1. Consequently,z¯=(x,Zx),a contradiction. Thus one should only consider the case thatξ1≠ξ¯1.According to Corollary 6.13, x1(zs) and ξ1(zs) are non-increasing and continuous in s while y1(zs) is non-decreasing and continuous in SA decentralization strategy s ∈ [0, TN]. In particular, the maximum (resp. minimum) of ξ1(zs) and x1(zs) are attained ats=0(resp.s=TN), i.e. when atomic player N plays the nonatomic decentralization strategyα(resp. the trivial decentralization strategyα¯). Since no s satisfies(x,Zx)=zs′,x1∉[x¯1,x1(zα̲)](because otherwise a contradiction can be obtained by arguments similar to the proof of Lemma 6.3). Butx1(zα̲)=TN,thus x1 cannot be greater than this. Thereforex1<x¯1. Ifξ1>ξ¯1,then for allj∈{0,…,N−1},y1j≤y¯1j. Indeed, forj=0,sincec1(ξ¯1)<c1(ξ1)≤c2(ξ2)<c2(ξ¯2),y¯10=T0≥y10. For each1≤j≤N−1,y¯1jis the solution of the following equations in w:(43)eitherw<Tjandc1(ξ¯1)+wc1′(ξ¯1)=c2(ξ¯2)+(Tj−w)c2′(ξ2¯),(44)orw=Tjandc1(ξ¯1)+wc1′(ξ¯1)≤c2(ξ¯2)+(Tj−w)c2′(ξ¯2),whiley1jis the solution of these equation in w:(45)eitherw<Tjandc1(ξ1)+wc1′(ξ1)=c2(ξ2)+(Tj−w)c2′(ξ2),(46)orw=Tjandc1(ξ1)+wc1′(ξ1)≤c2(ξ2)+(Tj−w)c2′(ξ2).Ify¯1jsatisfies Eq. (43), i.e.c1(ξ¯1)+y¯1jc1′(ξ¯1)=c2(ξ¯2)+(Tj−y¯1j)c2′(ξ2¯),sinceξ1>ξ1¯,c1(ξ1)+y¯1jc1′(ξ1)>c2(ξ2)+(Tj−y¯1j)c2′(ξ2¯). Thus, ify1jsatisfies either Eq. (45) or Eq. (46), theny1j<y¯1j. Ify¯1jsatisfies Eq. (44), theny¯1j=Tj≥y1j.Thereforey1≤y¯1. Butx1<x¯1,henceξ1<ξ¯1,contradictory to the hypothesis thatξ1>ξ¯1. This proves thatξ1≤ξ¯1and consequentlyy1≥y¯1. LetΔξ=ξ¯1−ξ1andΔx=x¯1−x1. Then Δx ≥ Δξ. Now let us show thatΠN(x,T−N)>UN(α¯,T−N).Atz¯,c1(ξ¯1)≤c2(ξ¯2)and, according to Eq. (6),c1(ξ¯1)+x¯1c1′(ξ¯1)≤c2(ξ¯2)+x¯2c2′(ξ¯2). Therefore, for all s ∈ [0, Δξ],(47)c1(ξ¯1−s)≤c2(ξ¯2+s),(48)c1(ξ¯1−s)+(x¯1−s)c1′(ξ¯1−s)≤c2(ξ¯2+s)+(x¯2+s)c2′(ξ¯2+s),Finally,ΠN(x,T−N)−UN(α¯,T−N)=[x1c1(ξ1)+x2c2(ξ2)]−[x¯1c1(ξ¯1)+x¯2c2(ξ¯2)]=[x2c2(ξ2)−x¯2c2(ξ¯2)]−[x¯1c1(ξ¯1)−x1c1(ξ1)]=[(x¯2+Δξ)c2(ξ¯2+Δξ)−x¯2c2(ξ¯2)+(Δx−Δξ)c2(ξ¯2+Δξ)]−[x¯1c1(ξ¯1)−(x¯1−Δξ)c1(ξ¯1−Δξ)+(Δx−Δξ)c1(ξ¯1−Δξ)]=∫0Δξc(ξ¯2+s)+(x¯2+s)c2′(ξ¯2+s)ds−∫0Δξc1(ξ¯1−s)+(x¯1−s)c1′(ξ¯1−s)ds+(Δx−Δξ)(c2(ξ¯2+Δξ)−c1(ξ¯1−Δξ)]≥0,because of Eqs. (47) and (48).Eq. (42) is proved. Meanwhile, an equilibrium strategy of player N in the Stackelberg game, i.e. a minimizer of the left hand side of Eq. (42), is also found:(xr(zα))r=12,where α is an optimal unilateral decentralization of player N.□For the sake of simplicity, denotezα¯byz¯,xr(zα¯)byx¯r,yj(zα¯)byy¯j,andξr(zα¯)byξ¯r.In the nonatomic case, atomic player N’s all decentralization strategies, including the trivial one (not decentralizing), result in the same outcome. Hence, the other players’ costs and the social cost never change after the decentralization.Now consider the trivial case and the nontrivial case. According to Lemmas 6.11 and 6.12 and their proofs,z¯is of mode 2. Thenc1(ξ¯1)<c2(ξ¯2).It is sufficient to prove the result for all SA strategies s ∈ [0, TN). Corollary 6.13 states that ξ1(zs) and x1(zs) are non-increasing in s and, in particular, strictly decreasing in a neighborhood around TN, while y1(zs) are non-decreasing in s. Fix an s ∈ [0, TN), and denote xr(zs) simply by xr,yrj(zs)byyrj,and ξr(zs) by ξr. Then,ξ1>ξ¯1andx1>x¯1. By the same argument used in the proof of Theorem 3.2, one can show that for all j ∈ I∖{0, N},y1j≤y¯1j.Let us compare the costs of the players in I∖{N} and the social cost at zswith those atz¯.For the nonatomic players in T0, the fact thatξ1≥ξ¯1immediately implies thatu0(z)=c1(ξ1)≥c1(ξ1¯)=u0(z¯). Equality holds if and only ifξ¯1=ξ1,which is impossible.For j ∈ I∖{0, N} such thatc1(ξ¯1)+y¯1jc1′(ξ¯1)=c2(ξ¯2)+y¯2jc2′(ξ¯2)and, consequently,y¯1jc1′(ξ¯1)>y¯2jc2′(ξ¯2)becausec1(ξ¯1)<c2(ξ¯2). Let B be a constant such thaty¯1jc1′(ξ¯1)>B>y¯2jc2′(ξ¯2). Then, for alls∈(ξ¯1−y¯1j,M−y¯1j]and allt∈[−y¯2j,ξ¯2−y¯2j),(49)y¯1jc1′(y¯1j+s)>B>y¯2jc2′(y¯2j+t).It follows from the relationξ1>ξ¯1thatξ1−y¯1j>ξ¯1−y¯1jandξ2−y¯2j<ξ¯2−y¯2j. Therefore,[y¯1jc1(ξ1)+y¯2jc2(ξ2)]−[y¯1jc1(ξ¯1)+y¯2jc2(ξ¯2)]=[y¯1jc1(y¯1j+ξ1−y¯1j)+y¯2jc2(y¯2j+ξ2−y¯2j)]−[y¯1jc1(y¯1j+y¯1−j)+y¯2jc2(y¯2j+y¯2−j)]=y¯1j[c1(y¯1j+ξ1−y¯1j)−c1(y¯1j+y¯1−j)]−y¯2j[c1(y¯2j+y¯2−j)−c2(y¯2j+ξ2−y¯2j)]=∫ξ¯1−y¯1jξ1−y¯1jy¯1jc1′(y¯1j+s)ds−∫ξ2−y¯2jξ¯2−y¯2jy¯2jc2′(y¯2j+t)dt>[ξ1−ξ¯1]B−[ξ¯2−j−ξ2]B=0,where the inequality is due to Eq. (49), and[y1jc1(ξ1)+y2jc2(ξ2)]−[y¯1jc1(ξ1)+y¯2jc2(ξ2)]=[y1j−y¯1j]c1(ξ1)+[y2j−y¯2j]c2(ξ2)=[y1j−y¯1j][c1(ξ1)−c2(ξ2)]≥0becausey1j≤y¯1jand c1(ξ1) < c2(ξ2). As a result,uj(zs)−uj(z¯)=[y1jc1(ξ1)+y2jc2(ξ2)]−[y¯1jc1(ξ¯1)+x¯2jc2(ξ¯2)]=[y1jc1(ξ1)+y2jc2(ξ2)]−[y¯1jc1(ξ1)+y¯2jc2(ξ2)]+[y¯1jc1(ξ1)+y¯2jc2(ξ2)]−[y¯1jc1(ξ¯1)+y¯2jc2(ξ¯2)]>0.For j ∈ I∖{0, N} such thatc1(ξ¯1)+y¯1jc1′(ξ¯1)<c2(ξ¯2)+y¯2jc2′(ξ¯2),y¯1j=Tj≥y1j. Recall that c2(ξ2) ≥ c1(ξ1) andξ1>ξ¯1. Therefore,uj(z)−uj(z¯)=[y1jc1(ξ1)+y2jc2(ξ2)]−Tjc1(ξ¯1)≥Tjc1(ξ1)−Tjc1(ξ¯1)>0.Finally, consider the social cost. Sincez¯is of mode 2 specified by 1 and l, it follows from Eq. (6) thatc1(ξ1¯)+x¯1c1′(ξ¯1)=c2(ξ¯2)+x¯2c2′(ξ¯2),andc1(ξ1¯)+y¯1jc1′(ξ¯1)=c2(ξ¯2)+y¯2jc2′(ξ¯2)for 1 ≤ j ≤ l if l ≥ 1. Summing thesel+1equations leads to(l+1)c1(ξ¯1)+[ξ¯1−(M−N−T[l])]c1′(ξ¯1)=(l+1)c2(ξ¯2)+ξ¯2c2′(ξ¯2). Consequently,c1(ξ¯1)+ξ¯1c1′(ξ¯1)=c2(ξ¯2)+ξ¯2c2′(ξ¯2)+l[c2(ξ¯2)−c1(ξ¯1)]+(M−N−T[l])c1′(ξ¯1). Sincec1(ξ¯1)≤c2(ξ¯2)and l ≥ 0, there exists a constant D > 0 such thatc1(ξ¯1)+ξ¯1c1′(ξ¯1)≥D≥c2(ξ¯2)+ξ¯2c2′(ξ¯2). According to Assumption 1, c1 and c2 are both strictly increasing whilec1′andc2′are non-decreasing. Hence, for anys∈(ξ¯1,M]and anyt∈[0,ξ¯2),(50)c1(s)+sc1′(s)>D>c2(t)+tc2′(t).Sinceξ1>ξ¯1,Eq. (50) implies thatCS(zs)−CS(z¯)=[ξ1c1(ξ1)+(M−ξ2)c2(M−ξ2)]−[ξ¯1c1(ξ¯1)+(M−ξ¯1)c2(M−ξ¯1)]=[ξ1c1(ξ1)−ξ¯1c1(ξ¯1)]−[(M−ξ¯1)c2(M−ξ¯1)−(M−ξ1)c2(M−ξ1)]=∫ξ¯1t[c1(s)+sc1′(s)]ds−∫M−ξ1M−ξ¯1[c2(t)+tc2′(t)]dt>(ξ1−ξ¯1)D−(M−ξ¯1−M+ξ1)D=0.□
