@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A guidance system using transesophageal echocardiography and magnetic tracking is presented which avoids the use of nephrotoxic contrast agents and ionizing radiation required for traditional fluoroscopically guided procedures. The aortic valve is identified in tracked biplane transesophageal echocardiography and used to guide stent deployment in a mixed reality environment. Additionally, a transapical delivery tool with intracardiac echocardiography capable of monitoring stent deployment was created. This system resulted in a deployment depth error of 3.4mm in a phantom. This was further improved to 2.3mm with the custom-made delivery tool. In comparison, the variability in deployment depth for traditional fluoroscopic guidance was estimated at 3.4mm.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a safe and effective treatment for aortic stenosis in patients unsuitable for conventional surgery [1]. As a result, this stent-based technique for delivery of a bioprosthetic valve has been used in over 40,000 patients worldwide [2]. This minimally invasive technique relies largely on single-plane fluoroscopy, with only gross structures visible [3]. In addition, the contrast agents injected into the aortic root during fluoroscopic guidance are nephrotoxic and can increase a patient's risk of acute kidney injury [4–7]. This is a major concern as many TAVI patients have underlying renal dysfunction and are more vulnerable to acute kidney injury. Furthermore, fluoroscopic imaging exposes both the patient and physicians to ionizing radiation. While the radiation dose for a single procedure is low, the cumulative radiation exposure of health care professionals at centers with a high throughput of TAVI is a concern [8].There have been several proposed alternatives to single plane fluoroscopy that aim to improve stent placement and reduce or eliminate the use of nephrotoxic contrast and ionizing radiation, including rotational angiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance. In rotational angiography, an intraoperative cone beam computer tomography (CT) volume is acquired by rotating a C-arm around the patient. This volume can be used to generate models of the aortic root which are overlaid on the fluoroscopy images to provide more anatomical context and can also be used to select the ideal fluoroscopy imaging plane [9]. This technique requires contrast and ionizing radiation to acquire the intraoperative CT volume and for fluoroscopy throughout the procedure. Alternatively, intraoperative MRI has been used to guide placement of the valve stent, resulting in successful implantation in animal studies [10]. Although this technique eliminates contrast and radiation exposure, intraoperative MRI is expensive and not widely available [11].Intraoperative ultrasound provides a more attractive modality for image guidance since it does not require nephrotoxic contrast agents or ionizing radiation in addition to being inexpensive and easily integrated into surgical workflow. TEE is frequently used during TAVI procedures for assessing valve function after the stent is deployed. Intraoperative guidance using only TEE [12] and TEE with fluoroscopy (without contrast agents) [13] has been previously reported. However, TEE does not provide satisfactory imaging of the catheter or surrounding tissue due to the highly reflective surface of the catheter and resulting shadowing artifacts. For this reason, TEE has been proposed as a bridging modality allowing preoperative models to be registered into the intraoperative environment. Lang et al. [14], proposed using TEE to register preoperative CT models to fluoroscopy to improve image guidance without requiring rotational angiography. Luo et al. [8] proposed a system using magnetic tracking of the TEE and catheter to eliminate the need for fluoroscopy entirely. In this system, a preoperative model of the aortic root was registered to the tracked ultrasound. The tracked catheter could then be visualized in relation to the aortic model so that the stent could be deployed at the desired depth. One challenge of these techniques is that the registration between ultrasound and preoperative CT is difficult resulting in a target registration error of 5.9±3.2mm and 3.3±1.6mm respectively. In addition, both these works used a manual segmentation of the aorta from preoperative CT which is time consuming and difficult to integrate into clinical workflow. Previous work with mitral valve repair has found that simply defining the valve annuli from tracked TEE is sufficient for image guidance and eliminates the need for complex preoperative models and registrations with associated errors [15]. Here, a simplified guidance system using TEE and magnetic tracking is developed and validated against fluoroscopic guidance in a phantom environment. A preliminary version of this guidance system was presented in McLeod et al. [16]. In our current paper we extend the guidance system to make use of biplane ultrasound, develop a novel delivery tool and validate our methods against fluoroscopy in a phantom environment.
