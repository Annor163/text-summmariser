@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundThis paper describes a new non-commercial software application (mfVEP2) developed to process multifocal visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) signals in latency (monocular and interocular) progression studies.MethodThe software performs analysis by cross-correlating signals from the same patients. The criteria applied by the software include best channels, signal window, cross-correlation limits and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Software features include signal display comparing different tests and groups of sectors (quadrants, rings and hemispheres).ResultsThe software׳s performance and capabilities are demonstrated on the results obtained from a patient with acute optic neuritis who underwent 9 follow-up mfVEP tests. Numerical values and graphics are presented and discussed for this case.ConclusionsThe authors present a software application used to study progression in mfVEP signals. It is also useful in research projects designed to improve mfVEP techniques. This software makes it easier for users to manage the signals and allows them to choose various ways of selecting signals and representing results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Objective assessment of the visual pathway is usually carried out by recording and analysing neurophysiological signals. The most common technique is to perform the visual-evoked-potential (VEP) test, which measures the potentials obtained by stimulating the complete visual field using the flash or checkerboard visual stimuli. This technique produces an overall response, but it does not provide specific topographical information about the retina and visual cortex.The advantage of the mfVEP test is that it allows practitioners to analyse the topographical features of different sectors of the visual field represented in the primary visual cortex [1].Improvements to various aspects related to the mfVEP technique, such as multi-focal stimulation [1], electrode number and position [2,3], filter and processing method [4], signal analysis and classification [5], etc., have enhanced its clinical utility in the diagnosis of diseases such as glaucoma, optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis and other pathologies that affect the visual pathway.The number of sectors into which the visual field is divided depends on the instrument used to record the mfVEPs. Possible values include 56 [6], 58 [7], 60 [8] and 120 [9]. The number of signals obtained in each sector depends on the number of electrodes (physical channels) and on the number of derived channels computed as the combination of the direct channels. Derived channels help to improve signal quality. For example, in [10] three channels are recorded and three derived channels are computed, thereby obtaining 6 channels for each sector.The mfVEP technique requires processing of a huge quantity of information. For example,Fig. 1 shows a representation of the visual field divided into 56 sectors. Two channels (vertical and horizontal) are recorded in each sector. Consequently, the number of signals per patient is 2⁎56⁎2=224.The parameters most widely used to characterise mfVEP signals are amplitude and latency. In patients with optic neuritis, increased signal-propagation time (latency) is thought to reflect demyelination of the optic nerve fibres, with the subsequent shortening of latency thought to represent the process of remyelination of the optic nerve [11].Multifocal VEP signal latency can be measured manually [12] [13]. Under this approach, the signals from the mfVEP map sector are grouped and latency is measured independently by three different observers within an 80–135ms window. The median of the three measurements is then selected. This method requires several specialists and the task takes a significant amount of time. It is a subjective decision and, as the sectors are grouped, spatial resolution is lost in mfVEP analysis.In monocular (single eye) analysis, two different automated techniques are used to compute absolute latency from an mfVEP signal. The first technique compares the signal with a reference template by performing cross-correlation. Hood et al. [14] perform cross-correlation with a template created for each location, eye and channel obtained from a normative group of 100 individuals — the Portland database [8]. In [15], the authors define an artificial template using wavelet kernels that model the mfVEP trace profile.The second technique uses a set of algorithms to identify the waveform-defined characteristics and measure the moment of time in which these are presented. These characteristics may be the start of response [16] or maximum and minimum values in a period of time [12]. In [17], latency is quantified by first selecting the mfVEP trace with the largest peak-to-peak amplitude, then using the timing of the second peak (minimum or maximum) as the trace latency.Two different techniques may be used to analyse latency progression. The first option is to subtract the absolute latencies obtained by the monocular method in baseline and follow-up tests [18,19]. The second option is to compare (correlate) signals between baseline and follow-up tests without using an external template.The authors have developed a new non-commercial software package named mfVEP2 (means Multifocal VEP applied to Progression) that adopts the latter option. It is an analysis tool with potential application in both clinical practice and research.The capabilities of mfVEP2 are as follows:•It facilitates study of latency progression and analyses data from different tests. This is very useful in routine clinical practice and clinical trials. It is designed to analyse latency progression in a subject by comparing recordings from different sessions (dates) and allows users to identify variations in latencies in monocular and interocular data.It permits selection of analysis parameters, such as the cross-correlation window, the SNR threshold, channel selection, etc. This option may be useful in research to study the effect of analysis parameters when computing latency.It displays the values and processed data to facilitate their study.It permits selection of visual field by area/quadrant/ring to allow study of specific regions of the eye.
