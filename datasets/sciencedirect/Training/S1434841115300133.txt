@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Design of optimal filters is an essential part of signal processing applications. It involves the computation of optimal filter coefficients such that the designed filter response possesses a flat passband and up to an infinite amount of stopband attenuation. This study investigates the effectiveness of employing the swarm intelligence (SI) based and population-based evolutionary computing techniques in determining and comparing the optimal solutions to the FIR filter design problem. The nature inspired optimization techniques applied are cuckoo search, particle swarm and real-coded genetic algorithm using which the FIR highpass (HP) and bandstop (BS) optimal filters are designed. These filters are examined for the stopband attenuation, passband ripples and the deviation from desired response. Moreover, the employed optimization techniques are compared on the field of algorithm execution time, t-test, convergence rate and obtaining global optimal results for the design of digital FIR filters. The results reveal that the proposed FIR filter design approach using cuckoo search algorithm outperforms other techniques in terms of design accuracy, execution time and optimal solution.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Filtering is the most extensively used complex process in signal processing. Filters in digital signal processing allow reforming the spectrum of the input signal to achieve the desired spectral characteristics in the output signal. Digital filters are widely accepted due to their linear phase characteristics, precision in performance, thermal stability, adaptability using a programmable processor, multiplexing, data logging and perfect reproducibility. They can be designed in hardware as well as software platforms and can process both real-time and stored signals. The digital filters are divided into two categories, namely FIR and IIR filters. FIR filters are preferred in applications with requirement of no phase distortion. Moreover, FIR filters are inherently stable systems, and are less sensitive to finite word length effect. Whereas, IIR filters involves less coefficients, requires less memory and are implemented when the requirements are of sharp cut-off and high throughput with lower computational complexity [1].The applications of digital filters are widespread. In communication systems, digital filters play a significant role in eliminating spectral leakage, reducing channel width, and eliminating interference (known as inter symbol interference, ISI) from adjacent symbols. Also, digital filter banks are increasingly employed in both wired and wireless communication systems [2]. Speech synthesis and analysis is another field where digital filters find applications [3]. In image processing applications, digital filters are selected to improve the quality of a distorted image containing regions with different characteristics [4]. Another important application of digital filters is to remove random noises in seismic data [5]. Digital filters are applied in the processing of biomedical signals such as ECG, EEG, MRI images and are incorporated in the life saving machines [6]. Research is made on the biological method for speech recognition and an artificial cochlea is modeled using the digital filters [7].The process of designing digital filters can be characterized as an optimization problem with an objective of minimizing the error function. This error function is basically an approximation function which indicates the deviation of the designed filter from the desired response. Further, each requirement can contribute with a mathematical term forming as a constraint optimization problem. Traditionally, different techniques exist for the design and implementation of the digital FIR filters [8]. The most straightforward way of implementing a digital filter is the windowing method. In this method, based on the requirements of limitation on the ripples in passband and stopband, transition width and stopband attenuation, different window function (Hamming, Kaiser, etc.) is selected. Another frequently used method to obtain an optimum filter is the least squares (LS) based technique which approximates the error function in the form of L2-norm. To avoid the overshoots in the filter response at discontinuities produced by LS approach, minimax technique is adopted. It approximates the Chebyshev error which is based on the L∞-norm and produces an equiripple filter. A relatively new approximation technique based on the L1-norm approximation of the error function for the design of FIR filters was devised in 2007 [9]. The filters based on L1-error approximation yield a flatter response in the passband and high attenuation in the stopband as compared to the LS and minimax techniques [10]. However, there are some drawbacks associated with these classical gradient based optimization techniques. In order to optimize multiple objectives in a single problem, these algorithms are discovered unfit. Further, they require fine tuning of parameters for fast and global convergence. Therefore, intelligent search paradigms and optimization methods were developed with which multiple objectives can be achieved in short computation time and with high accuracy [11].Based on the concepts of natural selection and evolution, heuristic evolutionary optimization algorithms have been developed and utilized by the researchers [12,13]. In 1975, genetic algorithm (GA) was introduced which is a general purpose probabilistic search algorithms inspired by natural genetic populations to evolve solutions with a great measure of success in search and optimization problems. Since then, a lot of research is done for the design of optimal filters using GA and its variants [14,15]. Another probabilistic method, simulated annealing (SA) was proposed in 1983, used to obtain the global minima of a cost function [16]. In 1995, a robust population-based stochastic search technique utilizing the swarm intelligent behavior was developed, known as the particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO ensures global solutions and is capable of handling non-differentiable and multi-objective functions [17–21]. Differential evolution (DE) is another stochastic, population-based optimization method developed in 1996. FIR filter design methods based on the DE algorithm are described in [22]. Other bio-inspired algorithm includes artificial bee colony optimization (ABC) introduced in 2007, which is more diverse and utilizes interesting characteristics and intelligent foraging behavior of honey bee swarm in the search of food [23]. One of the latest nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization techniques, developed in 2009, is the cuckoo-search algorithm (CSA). Recent research reveals that CSA is the most efficient optimization technique that can be applied for solving structural engineering problems compared to other nature-inspired algorithms [24].Some of the unique features of CSA [25] had made it very popular in a short span of time for optimization problems. These are summarized as following: (i) the parameter requirement in CSA is less as compared with other nature inspired optimization algorithms. (ii) With the elite behavior of cuckoo birds, the best solution always remains in the search space. (iii) The fine-tuning of parameters is not required in CSA. Furthermore, the convergence rate is independent of most of the parameters. (iv) Moreover, cuckoo search is more generalized as well as a robust algorithm for many optimization problems. (iv) CSA in combination with Lévy flight makes it possible to search for all the optima in a problem space for any multimodal functions. In a very short duration, CSA is being implemented on various kinds of optimization problems and is outperforming the other nature inspired optimization algorithms. Its applications includes: engineering design problems such as welded beam design, spring design optimization [26], structural engineering optimization problems such as cantilever beam design, corrugated bulkhead design, tubular column design, parameter identification of structures [24], optimization of PCB track length, robotics manipulator [27], annual crop planning problem [28], quadrature mirror filter bank design with fractional derivative constraints [29] design of fractional order differentiator [30].In this paper, the comprehensive and integrated study of CSA is exercised in order to design an FIR HP and BS filter. These filters can be transformed applying the similar design method in order to design other FIR filters (LP and BP). The design of an optimal filter involves the computation of such filter coefficients that produce the filter response with low magnitude ripples in the passband along with high attenuation in the stopband. This is obtained by the coefficients calculated through CSA. The designs are analyzed and presented in comparison with other bio-inspired optimization techniques PSO and real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA).Following is the structure of this paper. The mathematical problem formulation for the FIR filter design is described in Section 2. Section 3 focuses on the employed algorithms for the design of FIR filter and the problem specific implementation of the employed algorithms is described. The results and analysis of the simulations performed is demonstrated in Section 4. The progress report of CSA over other algorithms and comparison of the performance of FIR filters is also covered in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 draws the conclusion of the complete work.FIR filters possess properties of linear phase and inherent stability which encourage researchers to obtain improved designs so as to make them utilized in more practical applications. In order to design an optimal Nth order FIR HP and BS filter, the filter response H(ejω) with filter coefficients h[n], 0≤n≤N, is approximated to the desired frequency response, DHP(ω) and DBS(ω) for the highpass and bandstop filters respectively, defined asDHP(ω)=0,ω∈[0,ωc)stopband1,ω∈[ωc,π]passband(1)DBS(ω)=1,ω∈[0,ωc1)∪(ωc2,π]passband0,ω∈[ωc1,ωc2]stopbandThe approximating filter response, H(ejω) is obtained by the discrete time Fourier transformation (DTFT) of the filter impulse response, h[n] given by(2)H(ejω)=∑n=0Nh[n]e−jωnTo obtain the generalized results to design all types of FIR filters, Type-I linear phase filter with odd length and symmetric coefficients is considered. The condition for symmetric coefficients implies h[n]=h[N−n], 0≤n≤N and the amplitude response is given by [8](3)A(ω)=hN2+2∑n=1N/2hN2−ncos(ωn)The amplitude response in Eq. (3) is rewritten as(4)A(ω)=h[M]+2∑n=1MhM−ncos(ωn)Since the desired response is zero-phase, approximating it by H(ejω) is equivalent to approximating it by A(ω). Rewriting Eq. (4), we get(5)A(ω)=∑n=0N/2a[n]cos(ωn)where a[0]=h[M] and a[n]=2h[M−n], 1≤n≤M.The error function, E(ω) is computed by approximating the amplitude response, A(ω) to the ideal filter response. The error function E(ω) based on the L2-norm for the HP and BS filter design is expressed as(6)E(ω)2=∫0π∑n=0N/2A(ω)−DHP(ω)2dω(7)E(ω)2=∫0π∑n=0N/2A(ω)−DBS(ω)2dω_In this paper, the error function given in Eqs. (6) and (7) is employed as the objective function. The objective function is evaluated by the optimization algorithms at each iteration while substituting the filter coefficients explored from the search space. Constructing it as a minimization problem, this function is minimized using the CSA, PSO and RCGA optimization techniques and the corresponding optimized symmetric filter coefficients are used for the design of linear phase FIR HP and BS filters.
