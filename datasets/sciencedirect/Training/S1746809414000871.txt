@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents an on-line myoelectric control system which can classify eight prehensile hand gestures with only two electrodes. The overlapping windowing scheme is adopted in the system leading a continuous decisions flow. We choose mean absolute value (MAV), variance (VAR), the fourth-order autoregressive (AR) coefficient and Sample entropy (SampEn) as the feature set and utilize the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to reduce the dimension and obtain the projected feature sets. The current projected feature set and the previous one are “pre-smoothed” before the classification, and then a decision is generated by LDA classifier. To get the final decision from the decisions flow, the current decision and m previous decisions are “post-smoothed”. The method mentioned above can obtain a 99.04% off-line accuracy rate and a 97.35% on-line accuracy rate for individual gesture. By choosing a proper value of m, this method can also get a 99.79% accuracy rate for on-line recognition of complex sequences of hand gestures without interruption. In addition, a virtual hand has been developed to display the on-line recognition result visually, and a proper control strategy is proposed to realize the continuous switch of hand gestures.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The surface electromyography (sEMG) signal is a noninvasive electrical biosignal which can represent the muscles activities. As a type of easy-acquired signal, it has been widely used to control peripheral devices [1,2], especially prosthetic limb [3]. During the last decade, several mulitifunctional anthropomorphic prosthetic hands have been developed by some companies and research institutions [4–9], such as i-Limb hand [4] and SmartHand [6]. Their appearance and size are similar to human hand and they have 8-degrees of freedom at least. To control these prosthetic hands to perform prehensile gestures for activities of daily living, the pattern-recognition method in a supervised way is widely employed [10]. This method includes some fundamental processing parts [10] (Fig. 1): data preprocessing, data windowing, feature extraction, and classification.The corresponding features can be extracted from different types of muscle activities, and then these features are assigned to classes that represent corresponding limb motions, which are the patterns. These patterns are learned by an algorithm using some part of the features, and the algorithm is then used to classify the limb motions according to further features [11].The accuracy of the motion classification depends very much on the feature selection and extraction. A variety of EMG features have been proposed. They can be divided into three categories: time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain [1]. Each kind of features can represent the property of sEMG to some extent; however, due to the nonstationarity of the sEMG signals, it is very difficult for only one feature to reflect the most intrinsic property of the measured sEMG signals of a motion perfectly [12]. Many researches tend to use feature set (the combination of different features) to describe the sEMG signals of a certain motion [13–19]. Phinyomark et al. [13] explored many combinations of different features and compared their performance in the recognition of ten upper limb motions. It is concluded that the combination of SampEn, the fourth order cepstrum coefficients (CC), root mean square (RMS) and waveform length (WL) was considered the best robust multiple-feature set. Ju et al. [14] successfully recognized different hand grasps and in-hand manipulations by using multiple features which included Willison Amplitude (WAMP) and Determinism (DET).The effectiveness of the algorithm for off-line sEMG pattern recognition has been proven by many researches [16–18,20–24]. However, the biggest challenge is to gain a satisfactory accuracy rate for on-line sEMG recognition. In the case of realtime control of a prosthetic hand, a high accuracy rate is essential, and controlling the prosthetic hand in an intuitive and close-to natural way should also be considered carefully. Khushaba et al. [15] used various features and LIBSVM classifier to recognize ten individual fingers and combined finger movements which gained approximately 92% off-line and approximately 90% on-line classification accuracies. Chen and Wang [16] successfully classified ten Chinese number gestures on-line. Although they both realized the realtime recognition of different hand motions, the relax gesture must be inserted between every two hand motions when the realtime recognition was running. It does not meet the grasp habit of a real human hand and the switch of hand gestures should be continuous.Based on our previous research on the off-line recognition [22], we explore a realtime hand gesture recognition system which is more intuitive and natural for users to control the prosthetic hand. First, we adopt the overlapping windowing shceme [25] and use the feature set including MAV, VAR, the 4th AR and SampEn for the off-line training phase. Second, a post-processing method is used to process the continuous decisions for the realtime recognition. Finally, a virtual hand model is developed to show the recognition result of the realtime system visually, and a proper control strategy is employed to ensure that the virtual hand can change its gesture continuously without being interrupted by the rest gesture.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, an realtime myoelectric control system which can classify eight prehensile hand gestures has been implemented using only two electrodes. The optimal feature set that is suitable for the system includes MAV, VAR, the 4th AR and SampEn. Compared with the original feature set, it can raise the off-line average accuracy rate from 98.12% to 99.04%, and decrease the standard deviation from 1.69% to 0.65%. For the on-line recognition, we use the combination of “pre-smoothing” and “post-smoothing” to smooth the output. The on-line average accuracy rate for individual gesture can achieve 97.35%. This method is also suitable for the recognition of complex sequences of hand gestures. When we choose 13 decisions to “post-smoothing”, the subject can perform a serial of gestures with a 99.79% accuracy rate and only 2 wrong switch points when he changes his gesture. Using the proposed method, we tried to recognize eight kinds of hand gestures from two channel EMG signals and control the virtual hand in real-time. From the experimental results, we showed that the proposed method is applicable for real-time myoelectric hand control without a perceived operation time delay. In the future, we will explore the relationship between the force level of contraction and the recognition accuracy rate. And we will test the validity by applying the proposed method to a dextrous robot hand being developed.
