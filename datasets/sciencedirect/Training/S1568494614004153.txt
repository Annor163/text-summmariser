@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study aimed to consider the effect of dispositional optimism and pessimism to provide simple and useful decision models and methods for multiple criteria decision analysis within an interval-valued fuzzy environment. Uncertain and imprecise assessment information is usually present in many practical decision-making situations. Interval-valued fuzzy sets are useful for modeling impressions and quantifying the ambiguous nature of subjective judgments in a convenient way. Based on measurement tool estimations defined on interval-valued fuzzy sets, dual optimistic and pessimistic point operators were utilized in this study, and this paper discusses several important properties of optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations. Two algorithmic procedures were developed to address the effects of optimism and pessimism, involving changes in overall judgments and in the separate evaluations of alternatives with respect to each criterion. Furthermore, this study explored the practical problem of medical decision making to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method and to make a comparison with other existing methods. Finally, computational experiments were designed using enormous amounts of simulation data, and a comparative analysis of rank orders yielded by dual optimistic and pessimistic averaging operations was conducted.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The concept of interval-valued fuzzy sets (IVFSs) is defined by an interval-valued membership function [1,2], and an element's degree of membership in a set is characterized by the closed subinterval [0,1]. Because it may be difficult for decision makers to exactly quantify their opinions or subjective judgments as a number within the interval [0,1], it is appropriate to represent the degree of membership by an interval rather than a single number. IVFSs are the most widely used higher-order fuzzy sets because of their relative simplicity [3], and they are suitable for capturing imprecise or uncertain decision information in multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problems. Many useful methods have been developed to enrich IVFS theory in MCDA [4–10]. Although MCDA methods with IVFSs have been and still are studied in a variety of ways [11,12], issues related to optimistic and pessimistic MCDA methods using IVFS data have not yet been thoroughly explored.In general, optimistic decision makers are confident that a decision goal is attainable and anticipate desirable evaluation values; thus, they may overestimate the decision outcomes. Pessimistic decision makers, in contrast, are often doubtful about the level of attainment, making them more likely to underestimate the decision outcomes [13,14]. From this perspective, the effects of optimism and pessimism should be integrated into decision analysis processes, especially when they bear heavily on subjective judgments and decision outcomes. Chen [23] utilized several score functions based on interval-valued fuzzy point operators to quantify optimistic and pessimistic estimations and developed a model to reduce cognitive dissonance. Atanassov [15,16] introduced the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy set, which is characterized by the degree of membership, the degree of non-membership, and the degree of non-determinacy [17]. In the framework of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, some studies have been performed on MCDA methods with optimism and pessimism, such as multi-measure approaches [18], bivariate models [14], optimization models with score functions [19] or net predispositions [20], QUALItative FLEXible (QUALIFLEX) multiple criteria methods [21], and empirical outcome-oriented methods [22].However, Chen [22,14,23,18–20] and Chen and Tsui [21] neither consider the influences of averaging operations nor investigate optimistic and pessimistic estimations in averaging operations within the interval-valued fuzzy environment. The concept of averaging operations is a commonly known and very widely used approach to providing an aggregation procedure for MCDA or other comparative evaluations. For example, the weighted aggregation operators proposed by Liu [24], the weighted geometric aggregation operators proposed by Liu and Jin [25], and the intuitionistic linguistic power generalized aggregation operators proposed by Liu and Wang [26] provide useful and valuable aggregation procedures for handling MCDA problems. In MCDA, the averaging operation uses all criterion values of an alternative and employs arithmetic addition operations. MCDA can be solely utilized to compare the overall evaluations of alternatives. Furthermore, the averaging operation can serve as the core of sophisticated MCDA methods when it is incorporated into existing decision-making methodologies. The aforementioned studies [14,18–23] developed useful optimistic and pessimistic decision-making models and methods in the context of IVFSs or intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Nevertheless, they neither extended the basic averaging operations to handle optimistic and pessimistic estimations nor investigated optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations and their essential properties. Viewed in this light, this paper developed useful optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations to effectively capture the effects of optimism and pessimism on decision-making processes.The purpose of this paper was to propose optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations by incorporating the effect of dispositional optimism and pessimism into interval-valued fuzzy MCDA and to conduct a comparative analysis of dual optimistic and pessimistic point operators in averaging operations via computational experiments and practical applications. Specifically, this paper developed an appropriate method for capturing the effects of optimism and pessimism on MCDA using optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations. The concepts of optimistic and pessimistic point operators were employed to effectively determine optimistic and pessimistic estimations. Based on the suitability function of optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations, this paper established two algorithms to solve interval-valued fuzzy MCDA problems. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods were illustrated by considering a practical medical decision-making problem concerning acute inflammatory demyelinating disease. In addition, a comparative analysis with other existing approaches was performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Finally, different computer simulation experiments were carried out to determine the relationship between dual optimistic and pessimistic estimations. The rank-based comparison results indicated that optimistic and pessimistic point operators behave differently in averaging operations.The main advantages of the developed methods are a simple treatment procedure for aggregating IVFS decision information and methodological flexibility in dealing with the effects of optimism and pessimism in MCDA. Further advantages include the following. First, dual optimistic and pessimistic estimations were implemented based on IVFSs to determine the effects of optimism and pessimism on MCDA. Second, classical averaging operations were extended via dual optimistic and pessimistic estimations, and several important properties thereof were discussed in this study. The proposed optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations can be widely applied to solve MCDA problems for evaluation and selection. Third, compared with other optimistic/pessimistic MCDA methods in the IVFS context, it is easy to implement the computation procedure of the proposed method using the suitability function with optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations. Fourth, the optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations can not only be used to evaluate alternatives but can also be combined with other MCDA methods. Finally, the proposed method allows for the aggregation of decision information to utilize distinct optimistic/pessimistic point operators for each criterion. Employing different point operators according to the optimistic or pessimistic nature makes the proposed method very flexible.This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the concept of IVFSs. Section 3 establishes dual optimistic and pessimistic estimations using several point operators based on IVFSs. Several important and valuable properties of the optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations are also discussed. Section 4 proposes a suitability function based on optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations to develop two algorithms for handling interval-valued fuzzy MCDA problems. Section 5 demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methodology by considering a medical decision-making problem and conducting a comparative analysis with existing methods. Section 6 discusses the experimental analysis of rank orders yielded by dual optimistic/pessimistic point operators and averaging operations. Section 7 presents the conclusions of this work.This section briefly reviews some of the most important definitions, relations, and operations of IVFSs. Additionally, Table 1provides a list of mathematical notations for ease of reference throughout this paper.Definition 2.1Let Int([0,1]) stand for the set of all closed subintervals of [0,1]. Let X be an ordinary finite non-empty set. An IVFS A in X is expressed as follows:(1)A=x,MA(x)x∈X,where the function MA: X→Int([0,1]), such thatx→MA(x)=[MA−(x),MA+(x)], defines the degree of membership of an element x to A.For each IVFS A in X, the value(2)WA(x)=MA+(x)−MA−(x)represents the width of the interval MA(x). WA(x) can be considered the degree of hesitancy associated with the membership of element x∈X in IVFS A.For convenience of notation, the class of IVFSs in the universe X is denoted by IVFS(X). Leta¯=1−a∀a∈[0,1].Definition 2.3For every A, B∈IVFS(X), the relations and operations of IVFSs are defined as follows (“iff” means “if and only if” throughout this paper):(3)A⊂BiffMA−(x)≤MB−(x)andMA+(x)≤MB+(x)forallx∈X;(4)A⊃BiffB⊂A;(5)A=BiffMA−(x)=MB−(x)andMA+(x)=MB+(x)forallx∈X;(6)The complement of an IVFSAisAc=x,[MA+(x)¯,MA−(x)¯]x∈X;(7)A∩B=x,[min(MA−(x),MB−(x)),min(MA+(x),MB+(x))]x∈X;(8)A∪B=x,[max(MA−(x),MB−(x)),max(MA+(x),MB+(x))]x∈X.For every A∈IVFS(X), the necessity operator (□) and the possibility operator (♢) are defined, respectively, as follows:(9)□A=x,[MA−(x),MA−(x)]x∈X;(10)⋄A=x,[MA+(x),MA+(x)]x∈X.Optimism and pessimism have been conceptualized as both temporary states and trait-like factors reflecting generalized expectations for good and bad outcomes, respectively [27]. Optimism is viewed as a generally favorable outlook on future events, whereas pessimism is viewed as a generally unfavorable outlook [28,29]. Although optimistic or pessimistic bias may vary from one setting to the next, dispositional optimism or pessimism is indeed a psychological trait that lies at the heart of an individual's outlook on the real world [30].In this study, optimism and pessimism were related to multiple criteria decision-making behavior and appropriate assessment tools were established to measure these parameters in decision analysis. The assessment is rooted in the concepts of dispositional optimism and pessimism. Optimists construe their lives and future states of the world positively, whereas pessimists construe their lives and future states of the world negatively. In addition, optimists expect greater overall utility or favorable outcomes, while pessimists expect less overall utility or unfavorable outcomes. By extending the measurement tool estimations proposed by Atanassov et al. [31], several point operators were developed in this study and denotedJαx,βx,Jαx,βx*,Hαx,βx,Hαx,βx*,Pαx,βxandQαx,βxfor each point x∈X and αx, βx∈[0, 1]. These estimates for IVFSs are referred to as optimistic or pessimistic point operators.Definition 3.1For each x∈X and given the numerical parameters αx, βx∈[0, 1], the optimistic point operatorsJαx,βx,Jαx,βx*,Pαx,βx: IVFS(X)→IVFS(X) are defined as follows, for A∈IVFS(X):(11)Jαx,βx(A)=x,[MA−(x)+αx⋅WA(x),MA+(x)+βx¯⋅MA+(x)¯]x∈X;(12)Jαx,βx*(A)=x,[MA−(x)+αx⋅(WA(x)+βx¯⋅MA+(x)¯),MA+(x)+βx¯⋅MA+(x)¯]x∈X;(13)Pαx,βx(A)=x,[max(MA−(x),αx),max(MA+(x),βx¯)]x∈Xforαx+βx≤1.For each x∈X and given the numerical parameters αx, βx∈[0, 1], the pessimistic point operatorsHαx,βx,Hαx,βx*,Qαx,βx: IVFS(X)→IVFS(X) are defined as follows, for A∈IVFS(X):(14)Hαx,βx(A)=x,[αx⋅MA−(x),MA+(x)−βx⋅WA(x)]x∈X;(15)Hαx,βx*(A)=x,[αx⋅MA−(x),MA+(x)−βx⋅(WA(x)+αx¯⋅MA−(x))]x∈X;(16)Qαx,βx(A)=x,[min(MA−(x),αx),min(MA+(x),βx¯)]x∈Xforαx+βx≤1.Fig. 1presents a convenient geometrical interpretation of the possible extent of optimistic estimations and pessimistic estimations defined over IVFSs, includingJαx,βx(A)andJαx,βx*(A)in (a),Pαx,βx(A)in (b),Hαx,βx(A)andHαx,βx*(A)in (c), andQαx,βx(A)in (d).The optimistic point operatorJαx,βxtransforms an IVFS A into another IVFSJαx,βx(A)with the following degree of uncertainty (or hesitancy):(17)WJαx,βx(A)(x)=αx¯⋅WA(x)+βx¯⋅MA+(x)¯.The transformation of an ordinary fuzzy set using the optimistic point operatorJαx,βxwill lead to an increase in uncertainty. The two point operatorsJαx,βxandHαx,βxare dual operators. By employingAc=x,[MA+(x)¯,MA−(x)¯]x∈X, it follows thatJαx,βx(A)=x,[MA+(x)¯+αx⋅WA(x),MA−(x)¯+βx¯⋅MA−(x)]x∈X,(Jαx,βx(Ac))c=x,[1−MA−(x)¯−βx¯⋅MA−(x),1−MA+(x)¯−αx⋅WA(x)]x∈X=x,[βx⋅MA−(x),MA+(x)−αx⋅WA(x)]x∈X=Hβx,αx(A).The duality property reflects that, in a sense, pessimism is an antonym for optimism.Theorem 3.1Let A∈IVFS(X), x∈X, and αx, βx∈[0, 1]. IfMA−(x)+MA+(x)¯(=1−WA(x))≠0 for all x∈X,αx=MA−(x)MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯andβx=MA+(x)¯MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯, then(18)Jαx,βx(A)=x,αx,αx+βx⋅MA+(x)x∈X.See Appendix A.□To facilitate MCDA, an averaging operation, as an extension of the operations defined in (7) and (8) and popular means such as the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means, was developed.Definition 3.3Let κ1 and κ2 be real numbers and let a1, a2, …, an∈[0, 1]. For n IVFSs A1, A2, …, andAn, the averaging operations based on generalized means are defined as follows:(19)A1⊗κ1,κ2A2=⊗i=12Ai,(20)⊗i=1nAi=x,f(κ1,MA1−(x),MA2−(x),⋯,MAn−(x)),1−f(κ2,MA1+(x)¯,MA2+(x)¯,⋯,MAn+(x)¯)x∈X,where(21)f(κ,a1,a2,⋯,an)=a1κ+a2κ+⋯+anκn1/κ,ifκ>0or(κ<0anda1⋅a2⋯an>0);a1⋅a2⋯an1/n,ifκ=0;0,otherwise.The function f is the arithmetic mean when κ=1, the geometric mean for κ=0 and the harmonic mean for κ=−1. In addition, the function f reaches its lower bound (i.e., min operation) when κ→−∞ and its upper bound (i.e., max operation) when κ→+∞. Thus, the following immediate results are obtained:A∩B=A⊗−∞,+∞BandA∪B=A⊗+∞,−∞B. In particular, the arithmetic mean operation and its property are indicated in Appendix B.Theorem 3.2For n IVFSs A1, A2, …, An, let αx, βx∈[0, 1] for all x∈X.(22)⋄Jαx,βx(⊗i=1nAi)=⋄⊗i=1nJαx,βx(Ai).See Appendix A.□For the optimistic point operatorJαx,βx*, the degree of uncertainty ofJαx,βx*(A)is:(23)WJαx,βx*(A)(x)=αx¯⋅(WA(x)+βx¯⋅MA+(x)¯).In analogy toJαx,βx, there is increasing uncertainty of operatorJαx,βx*when the operator is employed in an ordinary fuzzy set. Moreover, according to (6) and (12),Jαx,βx*(Ac)=x,[MA+(x)¯+αx⋅(WA(x)+βx¯⋅MA−(x)),MA−(x)¯+βx¯⋅MA−(x)]x∈X(Jαx,βx*(Ac))c=x,1−MA−(x)¯+βx¯⋅MA−(x),1−MA+(x)¯+αx⋅(WA(x)+βx¯⋅MA−(x))x∈X=Hβx,αx*(A).Thus, the two point operatorsJαx,βx*andHαx,βx*are dual operators.Theorem 3.3Let A∈IVFS(X), x∈X, and αx, βx∈[0, 1]. IfMA−(x)+MA+(x)¯≠0for all x∈X,αx=MA−(x)MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯andβx=MA+(x)¯MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯, then(24)Jαx,βx*(A)=x,αx2+βx⋅MA−(x)+αx⋅βx⋅MA+(x),αx+βx⋅MA+(x)x∈X.For n IVFSs A1, A2, ⋯, An, let αx, βx∈[0, 1] for all x∈X.(25)⋄Jαx,βx*(⊗i=1nAi)=⋄⊗i=1nJαx,βx*(Ai).For the optimistic point operatorPαx,βx, the degree of uncertainty ofPαx,βx(A)is:(26)WPαx,βx(A)(x)=max(MA+(x),βx¯)−max(MA−(x),αx).In addition, duality exists between the point operatorsPαx,βxandQαx,βxbecause(Pαx,βx(Ac))c=Qβx,αx(A). The operatorPαx,βxhas the following properties.Theorem 3.5Let A∈IVFS(X), x∈X, αx, βx∈[0, 1], and αx+βx≤1. IfMA−(x)+MA+(x)¯≠0for all x∈X,αx=MA−(x)MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯andβx=MA+(x)¯MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯, then(27)Pαx,βx(A)=x,[αx,MA+(x)¯]x∈X.For n IVFSs A1, A2, …, An, let αx, βx∈[0, 1] and αx+βx≤1 for all x∈X.(28)Pαx,βx(⊗i=1nAi)⊂⊗i=1nPαx,βx(Ai).See Appendix A.□The pessimistic point operatorHαx,βxtransforms an IVFS A into another IVFSHαx,βx(A)with the following degree of uncertainty:(29)WHαx,βx(A)(x)=αx¯⋅MA−(x)+βx¯⋅WA(x).Furthermore,(Hαx,βx(Ac))c=Jβx,αx(A). The operatorHαx,βxhas the following properties.Theorem 3.7Let A∈IVFS(X), x∈X, and αx, βx∈[0, 1]. IfMA−(x)+MA+(x)¯≠0for all x∈X, letαx=MA−(x)MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯andβx=MA+(x)¯MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯, then(30)Hαx,βx(A)=x,αx⋅MA−(x),βx¯x∈X.For n IVFSs A1, A2, …, An, let αx, βx∈[0, 1] for all x∈X.(31)□Hαx,βx(⊗i=1nAi)=□⊗i=1nHαx,βx(Ai).For the pessimistic point operatorHαx,βx*, the degree of uncertainty ofHαx,βx*(A)is(32)WHαx,βx*(A)(x)=βx¯⋅(MA+(x)−αx⋅MA−(x)).Moreover,(Hαx,βx*(Ac))c=Jβx,αx*(A). The operatorHαx,βx*has the following properties.Theorem 3.9Let A∈IVFS(X), x∈X, αx, βx∈[0, 1]. IfMA−(x)+MA+(x)¯≠0for all x∈X,αx=MA−(x)MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯andβx=MA+(x)¯MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯, then(33)Hαx,βx*(A)=x,αx⋅MA−(x),αx⋅MA+(x)+αx⋅βx⋅MA−(x)x∈X.For n IVFSs A1, A2, …, An, let αx, βx∈[0, 1] for all x∈X.(34)□Hαx,βx*(⊗i=1nAi)=□⊗i=1nHαx,βx*(Ai).For the pessimistic point operatorQαx,βx, the degree of uncertainty ofQαx,βx(A)is:(35)WQαx,βx(A)(x)=min(MA+(x),βx¯)−min(MA−(x),αx).In addition,(Qαx,βx(Ac))c=Pβx,αx(A). The operatorQαx,βxhas the following properties.Theorem 3.11Let A∈IVFS(X), x∈X, αx, βx∈[0, 1], and αx+βx≤1. IfMA−(x)+MA+(x)¯≠0for all x∈X, letαx=MA−(x)MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯andβx=MA+(x)¯MA−(x)+MA+(x)¯, then(36)Qαx,βx(A)=x,[MA−(x),βx¯]x∈X.For n IVFSs A1, A2, …, An, let αx, βx∈[0, 1] and αx+βx≤1 for all x∈X.(37)Qαx,βx(⊗i=1nAi)⊃⊗i=1nQαx,βx(Ai).Consider an MCDA problem concisely expressed by an interval-valued fuzzy decision matrix whose element represents the evaluation value of the jth alternative, xj, with respect to the ith criterion, Ai. Each alternative was evaluated with respect to each criterion based on the fuzzy concept “excellence” using IVFSs. Suppose that a set of non-inferior alternativesX=x1,x2,…,xm. Each alternative is assessed based on n criteria denotedA=A1,A2,…,An. Let Mij: X→Int([0,1]) such thatxj→Mij=[Mij−,Mij+]. Assume thatMij−andMij+represent the lower and upper extremes of membership degrees, respectively, of the alternative xj∈X with respect to the criterion Ai∈A based on the fuzzy concept “excellence”. Note thatXij=xj,[Mij−,Mij+]. The degree of uncertainty of the alternative xjin the set Xijis defined byWij=Mij+−Mij−, whereMij−+Wij+(1−Mij+)=1. Assume for simplicity that the decision maker assigns equal importance to all evaluative criteria. According to a simple additive unweighted model, the suitability function used to determine the degrees to which the alternative xjsatisfies the decision maker's requirement can be expressed as follows:(38)⊗i=1nAi=xj,f(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−),1−f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯)xj∈X.The degree of suitability with which the alternative xjsatisfies the decision maker's requirement can be determined using the score function, also called the core or degree of support, proposed by Chen and Tan [32]. For example, the degree of suitability for (38) is given byf(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−)−f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯). A greater degree of suitability results in greater preference given to the alternative. If several alternatives have the same degree of suitability, the concept of accuracy functions proposed by Hong and Choi [33] can be employed to determine the rankings of those tied alternatives. In an IVFS setting, the accuracy function is given byMij−+(1−Mij+)(=1−Wij). Smaller hesitation margins indicate better accuracy.The decision maker's optimism or pessimism can be assessed using the Life Orientation Test (LOT) developed by Scheier and Carver [28] or the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) developed by Scheier et al. [29]. Both scales have strong predictive and discriminative validity [29]. The LOT-R can be administered to decision makers at the beginning of decision-making processes, and the decision makers can be differentiated into three types, optimists, neutralists and pessimists, based on their LOT-R scores. When the decision maker is a neutralist, a simple additive result can be directly obtained by employing (38) for each alternative.Letαxj,βxj∈[0,1]for all xj∈X. Assume that individual differences in optimism or pessimism influence overall judgments. The suitability function used to determine the degrees to which the alternative xjsatisfies the decision maker's requirement can be measured as described below. For the optimistic condition, (11) and (38) are used to compute the suitability functionJαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)as follows:(39)Jαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)=xj,f(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−)+αxj⋅1−f(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−)−f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯),1−βxj⋅f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯)xj∈X.Alternatively, the suitability functionJαxj,βxj*(⊗i=1nAi)is obtained using (12) and (38):(40)Jαxj,βxj*(⊗i=1nAi)=xj,f(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−)+αxj⋅1−f(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−)−βxj⋅f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯),1−βxj⋅f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯)xj∈X.For the optimistic condition with restrictions, the suitability functionPαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)is obtained using (13) and (38):(41)Pαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)=xj,maxf(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−),αxj,1−minf(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯),βxjxj∈Xforαxj+βxj≤1.For the pessimistic condition, the suitability functionHαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)is obtained using (14) and (38):(42)Hαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)=xj,αxj⋅f(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−),1−f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯)−βxj⋅1−f(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−)−f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯)xj∈X.Alternatively, the suitability functionHαxj,βxj*(⊗i=1nAi)is obtained using (15) and (38):(43)Hαxj,βxj*(⊗i=1nAi)=xj,αxj⋅f(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−),1−f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯)−βxj⋅1−αxj⋅f(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−)−f(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯)xj∈X.For the pessimistic condition with restrictions, the suitability functionQαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)is obtained using (16) and (38):(44)Qαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)=xj,minf(κ1,M1j−,M2j−,…,Mnj−),αxj,1−maxf(κ2,M1j+¯,M2j+¯,…,Mnj+¯),βxjxj∈Xforαxj+βxj≤1.Assume that individual differences in optimism or pessimism influence outcomes in the decision matrix. In a similar manner, the corresponding suitability functions can be determined using (11)–(16) and (38). For the optimistic condition,(45)⊗i=1nJαxj,βxj(Ai)=xj,f(κ1,M1j−+αxj⋅W1j,M2j−+αxj⋅W2j,…,Mnj−+αxj⋅Wnj),1−f(κ2,βxj⋅M1j+¯,βxj⋅M2j+¯,…,βxj⋅Mnj+¯)xj∈X,or(46)⊗i=1nJαxj,βxj*(Ai)=xj,f(κ1,M1j−+αxj⋅(1−M1j−−βxj⋅M1j+¯),M2j−+αxj⋅(1−M2j−−βxj⋅M2j+¯),…,Mnj−+αxj⋅(1−Mnj−−βxj⋅Mnj+¯)),1−f(κ2,βxj⋅M1j+¯,βxj⋅M2j+¯,…,βxj⋅Mnj+¯)xj∈X.For the optimistic condition with restrictions,(47)⊗i=1nPαxj,βxj(Ai)=xj,f(κ1,max(M1j−,αxj),max(M2j−,αxj),…,max(Mnj−,αxj)),1−f(κ2,min(M1j+¯,βxj),min(M2j+¯,βxj),…,min(Mnj+¯,βxj))xj∈Xforαxj+βxj≤1.For the pessimistic condition,(48)⊗i=1nHαxj,βxj(Ai)=xj,f(κ1,αxj⋅M1j−,αxj⋅M2j−,…,αxj⋅Mnj−),1−f(κ2,M1j+¯+βxj⋅W1j,M2j+¯+βxj⋅W2j,…,Mnj+¯+βxj⋅Wnj)xj∈X,or(49)⊗i=1nHαxj,βxj*(Ai)=xj,f(κ1,αxj⋅M1j−,αxj⋅M2j−,…,αxj⋅Mnj−),1−f(κ2,βxj⋅(1−αxj⋅M1j−−M1j+¯),βxj⋅(1−αxj⋅M2j−−M2j+¯),…,βxj⋅(1−αxj⋅Mnj−−Mnj+¯))xj∈X,For the pessimistic condition with restrictions,(50)⊗i=1nQαxj,βxj(Ai)=xj,f(κ1,min(M1j−,αxj),min(M2j−,αxj),…,min(Mnj−,αxj)),1−f(κ2,max(M1j+¯,βxj),max(M2j+¯,βxj),…,max(Mnj+¯,βxj))xj∈Xforαxj+βxj≤1.For optimistic or pessimistic decision makers, the steps used to solve an MCDA problem using the optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations of the simple additive model can be summarized as follows.Algorithm IFor the effect of optimism or pessimism on overall judgments.Step 1:Establish n evaluation criteria Ai(i=1, 2, …, n) that the decision maker has judged to be relevant in a given decision situation. DenoteA=A1,A2,…,An.Step 2:Develop m feasible alternatives xj(j=1, 2, …, m) to achieve the goals or attain the decision maker's needs and desires. DenoteX=x1,x2,…,xm. Setαxj,βxj∈[0,1]for all xj∈X according to the decision maker's preference of alternatives.Step 3:Evaluate alternatives in terms of criteria based on the fuzzy concept “excellence”, where the values of criterion functions are expressed by IVFSs. DenoteXij=xj,[Mij−,Mij+].Step 4:Acquire the synthetic evaluation of the alternative xjwithout considering optimism or pessimism using the averaging operation in (38).Step 5:Determine the suitability function of the alternative xjby employing the optimistic and pessimistic point operators. Use (39) or (40) for the optimistic condition, (41) for the optimistic condition with restrictions, (42) or (43) for the pessimistic condition, and (44) for the pessimistic condition with restrictions.Step 6:Measure the degree of suitability for each alternative by means of Chen and Tan's score function.Step 7:Rank the preference order of all alternatives according to the degree of suitability. If jo∈{1, 2, …, m} exists such that the score function is maximized, then the alternativexjois the best choice.For the effect of optimism or pessimism on individual outcomes.Step 1:See Step 1 of Algorithm (I).Step 2:See Step 2 of Algorithm (I).Step 3:See Step 3 of Algorithm (I).Step 4:Construct the interval-valued fuzzy decision matrix that is composed of all Xij.Step 5:Utilize the optimistic point operators (using (11), (12), or (13)) and pessimistic point operators (using (14), (15), or (16)) to reconstruct the interval-valued fuzzy decision matrix.Step 6:Determine the suitability function of the alternative xjby employing the optimistic/pessimistic averaging operation. Use (45) or (46) for the optimistic condition, (47) for the optimistic condition with restrictions, (48) or (49) for the pessimistic condition, and (50) for the pessimistic condition with restrictions.Step 7:See Step 6 of Algorithm (I).Step 8:See Step 7 of Algorithm (I).Another key point in the proposed method must be mentioned. For simplicity, it was assumed in this study that the suitability function is determined by a simple additive unweighted model. The relative importance of each criterion can be incorporated into the suitability function, and then, the same problem can be solved using additive weighted methods.This section explores a medical decision-making problem concerning acute inflammatory demyelinating disease that demonstrates the effective use of the proposed MCDA method based on optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations in an IVFS framework. In this study, the medical case considered by Chen et al. [34] and Chen and Tsui [21] at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan was assessed.In the case of Chen et al. [34] and Chen and Tsui [21], the patient was a 48-year-old widowed female with a history of diabetes mellitus. Her physician made a diagnosis of acute inflammatory demyelinating disease. The physician assessed the patient's medical history and her current physical conditions and provided the following treatment options: steroid therapy (x1), plasmapheresis (x2), and albumin immune therapy (x3). Denote the alternative set X={x1, x2, x3}. Nine criteria were used to evaluate the alternatives, including survival rate (A1), severity of the side effects (A2), severity of the complications (A3), probability of a cure (A4), discomfort index of the treatment (A5), cost (A6), number of days of hospitalization (A7), probability of a recurrence (A8), and self-care capacity (A9). Denote the set of all criteria A={A1, A2, …, A9}. For all xj∈X, some cases of fixed point operators are addressed as examples: (i)αxj=0.1andβxj=0.7; (ii)αxj=0.4andβxj=0.4; (iii)αxj=0.7andβxj=0.1, and (iv) the variant point operatorsαxj=Mij−/(Mij−+Mij+¯)andβxj=Mij+¯/(Mij−+Mij+¯). Steps 1 and 2 have been completed.In Step 3, the three treatment methods were evaluated based on the nine criteria. The results of nine-point linguistic ratings reported by Chen et al. [34] are presented in Table 2. The data type used by Chen et al. [34] is an interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy number, whereas the data type used in this study was an IVFS. Linguistic assessments instead of numerical ones can make it easier for decision makers to express their evaluative ratings about the alternatives within the fuzzy or uncertain environment [35–40]. Several studies have employed the linguistic variable method, in which a corresponding relation between linguistic values and semantics is parameterized by intuitionistic fuzzy sets [41–46]. The linguistic rating systems for intuitionistic fuzzy values include ten-point scales [42], nine-point scales [46], six-point scales [43], and five-point scales [41,44,45]. In this study, Zhang and Liu's [46] nine-point scales (see the middle column of Table 3) were adopted because the linguistic ratings provided by Chen et al. [34] belong to nine-point scales. Zhang and Liu's [46] proposed intuitionistic fuzzy values can be expressed equivalently using IVFSs, as indicated in the right column of Table 3. The linguistic evaluations in Table 2 can be converted to IVFSs by employing the values presented in Table 3; then, the value Xijof the criterion functions can be obtained.Applying Step 4 of Algorithm (I), the synthetic evaluation of each alternative is calculated in the cases of κ1=κ2=0, 1, 2, 10. To illustrate the calculations in Steps 4–6 of Algorithm (I), the case of κ1=κ2=0 is used as an example as follows:⊗i=19Ai=x1,[0.3388,0.6607],x2,[0.5182,0.7166],x3,[0.4544,0.7393].According to Step 5 of Algorithm (I), if this patient is an optimist, the suitability function of each alternative that results by employing the variant point operatorJαxj,βxjwithαxj=Mij−/(Mij−+Mij+¯)andβxj=Mij+¯/(Mij−+Mij+¯), for example, is calculated as follows:Jαxj,βxj(⊗i=19Ai)=x1,[0.4996,0.8302],x2,[0.6465,0.8998],x3,[0.6354,0.9050].Applying Step 6 of Algorithm (I), the degree of suitability for each alternative can then be determined as follows:MJαxj,βxj(⊗i=19Ai)−(x1)+MJαxj,βxj(⊗i=19Ai)+(x1)−1=0.3298,MJαxj,βxj(⊗i=19Ai)−(x2)+MJαxj,βxj(⊗i=19Ai)+(x2)−1=0.5463,MJαxj,βxj(⊗i=19Ai)−(x3)+MJαxj,βxj(⊗i=19Ai)+(x3)−1=0.5404.In Step 7 of Algorithm (I), the ranking order of the three treatment options can be determined based on the degrees of suitability: x2≻x3≻x1, which is the same as that obtained by Chen and Tsui [21] and Chen et al. [34].Consider the employment of the fixed point operators in (i)–(iii) and the variant point operator in (iv). Table 4presents the ranking results of the treatment options yielded by Algorithm (I) withJαxj,βxj,Jαxj,βxj*,Hαxj,βxj, andHαxj,βxj*separately. As presented in Table 4, the priority ranking x2≻x3≻x1 is obtained in most of the cases; moreover, x3≻x2≻x1 is acquired in some cases, especially when κ1=κ2=1.Based on the value Xijof the criterion functions developed in Step 3, the interval-valued fuzzy decision matrix can be constructed according to Step 4 of Algorithm (II). Consider the variant point operatorJαxj,βxjwithαxj=Mij−/(Mij−+Mij+¯)andβxj=Mij+¯/(Mij−+Mij+¯)for example. Applying Step 5 of Algorithm (II), the interval-valued fuzzy decision matrix can be reconstructed by employing the variant point operatorJαxj,βxjas follows:([Mij−,Mij+])3×9=A1A2A3x1x2x3[0.8333,0.9750][0.8947,0.9895][0.8947,0.9895][0.8333,0.9750][0.5556,0.8222][0.7222,0.9306][0.2778,0.5306][0.7222,0.9306][0.2778,0.5306]A4A5A6[0.3889,0.6639][0.8947,0.9895][0.8333,0.9750][0.8947,0.9895][0.2778,0.5306][0.8947,0.9895][0.8333,0.9750][0.3889,0.6639][0.0500,0.0975]A7A8A9[0.1579,0.3263][0.3889,0.6639][0.5556,0.8222][0.0500,0.0975][0.8333,0.9750][0.8333,0.9750][0.2778,0.5306][0.5556,0.8222][0.5556,0.8222].According to Step 6 of Algorithm (II), the optimistic averaging operation in the case of κ1=κ2=1, for example, is utilized to determine the suitability function of each alternative as follows:⊗i=19Jαxj,βxj(Ai)=x1,[0.5052,0.6737],x2,[0.6124,0.8208],x3,[0.6241,0.7925].For Step 7 of Algorithm (II), the degree of suitability for each alternative can then be obtained as follows:M⊗i=19Jαxj,βxj(Ai)−(x1)+M⊗i=19Jαxj,βxj(Ai)+(x1)−1=0.1789,M⊗i=19Jαxj,βxj(Ai)−(x2)+M⊗i=19Jαxj,βxj(Ai)+(x2)−1=0.4332,M⊗i=19Jαxj,βxj(Ai)−(x3)+M⊗i=19Jαxj,βxj(Ai)+(x3)−1=0.4166.Finally, Step 8 of Algorithm (II) results in the following order: x2≻x3≻x1. Table 5presents the ranking results of the three treatment options yielded by Algorithm (II) withJαxj,βxj,Jαxj,βxj*,Hαxj,βxj, andHαxj,βxj*when employing the fixed point operators in (i)–(iii) and the variant point operator in (iv). The ranking result x2≻x3≻x1 is obtained in most of the cases; x3≻x2≻x1 is acquired in some cases, especially when employing the fixed point operators and κ1=κ2=1.A comparative analysis was conducted using the results obtained by Chen and Tsui [21] and Chen et al. [34] to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method. Chen and Tsui [21] proposed an outranking model, a QUALIFLEX method, for relating optimism and pessimism within the intuitionistic fuzzy decision environment. Chen et al. [34] developed an extended QUALIFLEX method for handling MCDA problems in the context of interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Additionally, Chen et al. [34] extended the method of ELimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) to the interval type-2 fuzzy environment. For the same medical decision-making problem of acute inflammatory demyelinating disease, Table 6compares the ranking results obtained by Chen and Tsui [21], Chen et al. [34], and those obtained via the method proposed in this study.The intuitionistic fuzzy QUALIFLEX method for optimistic and pessimistic decision making developed by Chen and Tsui [21], the extended QUALIFLEX method based on interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers developed by Chen et al. [34], and the methods proposed in this study yielded highly similar ranking results for the three alternatives. The results yielded by the proposed methods fulfill the partial orders (i.e., x2≻x1 and x3≻x1) produced by Chen et al.’s [34] extended ELECTRE method using interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. More specifically, the methods of Chen and Tsui [21] and Chen et al. [34] and the proposed method yielded identical ranking results in the cases of κ1=κ2=0, 2, 10 for Algorithm (I) and κ1=κ2=0, 10 for Algorithm (II). This finding implies that the varied settings of the values of κ1 and κ2 in the averaging operation might produce different solution results. Furthermore, with respect to Algorithm (II), the employment of the variant point operator produces more identical ranking results than the employment of the fixed point operator, especially in cases in whichJαxj,βxjandJαxj,βxj*are used.Compared with the solution results obtained by the extended QUALIFLEX method [34], the extended ELECTRE method [34], and the intuitionistic fuzzy QUALIFLEX method [21], the methods proposed methods in this study generated reasonable and credible ranking results for the alternatives considered. As illustrated in the medical decision-making example, the computation procedures of the proposed methods for Algorithm (I) and Algorithm (II) are very easy to implement. Furthermore, the proposed optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations exhibit methodological flexibility in dealing with the effects of optimism and pessimism in MCDA. Thus, the applicability of the proposed methods using the suitability function with optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations can be validated using the comparative analysis performed for the illustrative example.The proposed optimistic/pessimistic estimations and averaging operations can be easily incorporated into existing decision-making methods. Chen [19] constructed several linear programming models to determine the optimal criteria weights and to acquire the optimal degree of suitability. In the following, the optimistic/pessimistic estimations are incorporated into Chen's [19] optimization model with weighted score functions. Consider the same medical decision-making problem of acute inflammatory demyelinating disease. Let widenote the weight of the criterion Ai∈A. Assume that the conditions of criterion weights are given as follows:0.09≤w1≤0.4,0.02≤w2≤0.1,0.03≤w3≤0.2,0.09≤w4≤0.4,0.01≤w5≤0.1,0.05≤w6≤0.2,0.05≤w7≤0.2,0.07≤w8≤0.3, and0.06≤w9≤0.3. Using the optimistic estimations yielded by the variant point operatorJαxj,βxj, for example, and Chen's [19] optimization model, the following linear programming model is established:max2.5767w1+1.8389w2+0.2696w3+1.7453w4+1.5768w5+0.0086w6−0.0852w7+0.7641w8+0.5640w9s.t.0.09≤w1≤0.4,0.02≤w2≤0.1,0.03≤w3≤0.2,0.09≤w4≤0.4,0.01≤w5≤0.1,0.05≤w6≤0.2,0.05≤w7≤0.2,0.07≤w8≤0.3,0.06≤w9≤0.3,∑i=19wi=1.The optimal solution of the criterion weights isw¯=(0.4, 0.1, 0.03, 0.23, 0.01, 0.05, 0.05, 0.07, 0.06). The optimal values of the suitability functions are 0.3628, 0.6970, and 0.6635 for x1, x2, and x3, respectively, and thus, the ranking result x2≻x3≻x1 is obtained. This result is the same as that reported by Chen and Tsui [21] and Chen et al. [34] and that afforded by the proposed MCDA method.Consider the case in which objective and subjective criteria simultaneously exist in MCDA problems. A normalization procedure can be used to handle the values of the objective criteria; then, the normalized value can be converted to IVFSs. For example, the number of rooms in a house is an objective criterion for the MCDA problem of choosing an appropriate house. The number of rooms is a non-monotonic utility criterion because the maximum utility is located somewhere in the middle of the criterion range. Let ψjdenote the number of rooms in a candidate house xjand ψodenote the most favorable value provided by the decision maker. Let σ denote the standard deviation of all of the ψjvalues. According to Yoon and Hwang [47] approach, non-monotonic criteria become monotonic by using the statistical z score: exp(−z2/2), where z=(ψj−ψo)/σ. Then, the comparable IVFS value can be obtained by converting exp(−z2/2) to an interval [exp(−z2/2), exp(−z2/2)]. For example, assume that the numbers of rooms (ψ1−ψ4) in four candidate houses are 3, 4, 5, and 6, where 4 is the decision maker's most preferred number. The resulting exp(−z2/2) values are 0.74, 1.00, 0.74, and 0.30 for ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, and ψ4, respectively. The converted interval values are [0.74, 0.74], [1.00, 1.00], [0.74, 0.74], and [0.30, 0.30]. Employing one of the normalization procedures and converting a crisp number to an interval, the alternative ratings with respect to the objective criteria can be easily expressed by IVFSs. Thus, the proposed method can be used even though objective and subjective criteria simultaneously exist within the decision environment.This section discusses the implementation of a comparative analysis of large simulation experiments to observe the relationships between the dual optimistic and pessimistic estimations in averaging operations.The following two computational experiments were conducted to gain insight into the relationships between dual point operators. Random data were generated to establish MCDA problems with all possible combinations of 3, 5, 7, …, 21 alternatives and 3, 5, 7, …, 21 criteria. Thus, 100 (=10×10) different instances were examined in each computational experiment. Moreover, consider all possible combinations ofαxj(=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, …, 1.0) andβxj(=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, …, 1.0). For each instance, 1000 different interval-valued fuzzy decision matrices were randomly produced under the preliminary conditions of the IVFSs, generating a total of 200,000 (=100×1000×2) sets of experimental cases. To compare the ranking results yielded by dual optimistic and pessimistic estimations, the mean Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) of 1000 experimental observations were computed under various cases. This study conducted a comparative analysis to determine the effect of the number of alternatives, the number of criteria, and the different settings of the parametersαxj,βxj, κ1 and κ2 on the mean Spearman correlation coefficients.Given the condition m=n=7, the purpose of the first experiment is to determine whether parameter settings exert an effect on average Spearman correlation coefficients. In this study, κ1=κ2=±1, ±2, ±10 were designated in the averaging operations. The results are presented in Figs. 2–4for Algorithm (I) and Figs. 5–7for Algorithm (II). As the plots in Fig. 2 illustrate, various values of κ1 and κ2 yield limited changes in the relationships between average ρ-values andαxj×βxjcombinations, and the results reveal similar patterns in (a)-(f). The same findings are also observed in Fig. 3. Overall, these relationships are not linear. The average ρ-values seem to be decreasing on either side ofαxj+βxj=0.7in Fig. 2 andαxj+βxj=0.9in Fig. 3. The effects on the Spearman correlation coefficients vary in opposite directions. The rank orders betweenJαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)andHαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)receive very low ρ-values when bothαxjandβxjare large, as do rankings betweenJαxj,βxj*(⊗i=1nAi)andHαxj,βxj*(⊗i=1nAi). As illustrated in Fig. 2, in cases of smallαxjvalues, the rankings derived byJαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)andHαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)appear to be highly positively related when theβxjvalues are approximately 0.4 to 0.6. Nevertheless, in cases of largeαxjvalues, the rankings are moderately positively related when theβxjvalues are approximately 0.1–0.3. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate somewhat different correlations. For example, the rankings obtained usingJαxj,βxj*(⊗i=1nAi)andHαxj,βxj*(⊗i=1nAi)are strongly positively related whenαxj=0.1andβxj=0.7−0.9,αxj=0.2andβxj=0.6−0.8, andαxj=0.3andβxj=0.4−0.6.The patterns shown in Fig. 4 are strikingly different compared with those shown in Figs. 2 and 3 because of the extra conditionαxj+βxj≤1. There is a moderate difference between the cases in (a), (c), and (e). On the other hand, the patterns in (b), (d), and (f) are relatively similar. However, the patterns in cases of positive κ values and negative κ values vary greatly. AlthoughPαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)andQαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)generally seem to be positively correlated with one another, the relationship between them is weak and the highest Spearman correlation coefficient turns out to be only approximately 0.25. Furthermore, several negative correlations appear in (c) and (e), such as −0.0060 atαxj=0.1andβxj=0.8in (c), and −0.0002 atαxj=0.1andβxj=0.9in (e). Simply stated, the resulting ρ-values indicate no strong relationship betweenPαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)andQαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi).As shown in Fig. 5,⊗i=1nJαxj,βxj(Ai)and⊗i=1nHαxj,βxj(Ai)are positively correlated with one another. However, the correlations between them in these six instances are significantly different. The highest resulting Spearman correlation coefficients are 0.9304 atαxj=0.3andβxj=0.4in (a), 0.4526 atαxj=0.4andβxj=0.3in (b), 0.7766 atαxj=βxj=0.4in (c), 0.3607 atαxj=0.3andβxj=0.4in (d), 0.4877 atαxj=βxj=0.5in (e), and 0.2416 atαxj=βxj=0.3in (f). The lowest ρ-values are approximately 0.1 when the values ofαxjandβxjare very close to one. Because Fig. 5(a) is generally similar to Fig. 2(a), the resulting ρ-values determined by Algorithms (I) and (II) are similar when κ1=κ2=1. In addition, the discrepancy between the correlations among variousαxj×βxjcombinations is clearly small when κ1=κ2=−10.Fig. 6 illustrates the rank-based comparison results between⊗i=1nJαxj,βxj*(Ai)and⊗i=1nHαxj,βxj*(Ai)with fixed point operators when m=n=7. Except for (f), the figures in (a)–(e) are generally close to the average. The highest ρ-values are above 0.7 in (a)–(e), but the highest ρ-value falls to 0.4901 in (f). A simple reduction in the discrepancy of the average ρ-values among variousαxj×βxjcombinations was observed in the case of κ1=κ2=−10. The patterns are similar between Figs. 6(a) and 3(a) and between Figs. 6(b) and 3(b). Hence, the results for Algorithms (I) and (II) are roughly identical for κ1=κ2=1 and κ1=κ2=2, respectively.⊗i=1nPαxj,βxj(Ai)and⊗i=1nQαxj,βxj(Ai)are compared in Fig. 7. The correlation results are weakly positive, and the highest ρ-value is merely approximately 0.25 for each case. Unlike the results forPαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi)andQαxj,βxj(⊗i=1nAi), no negative correlation was discovered between rankings from⊗i=1nPαxj,βxj(Ai)and⊗i=1nQαxj,βxj(Ai). In addition, the correlation coefficient was observed to be maximal atαxj+βxj=1.0for positive κ values and atαxj+βxj=0.4for negative κ values. Overall, the patterns in (b), (d) and (f) show a closer resemblance than those in (a), (c) and (e).To obtain a deeper understanding of the relationships between two rank orders produced by dual optimistic and pessimistic estimations, an experimental analysis of the Spearman correlation coefficients for each m×n combination was conducted. Taking κ1=κ2=1, for example, the rank orders determined by opposite estimations with fixed and variant operators were compared. Fig. 8presents the results for 1000 experimental observations for every pairwise comparison for Algorithm (I), and Fig. 9presents the results for Algorithm (II), where the settings ofαxjandβxjwithin the fixed operators are randomly generated for each experimental case.The computational results shown in Figs. 8 and 9 indicate that the discrepancy among average ρ-values is not significant at large m values. Conversely, as m decreases, the plots of average ρ-values become quite steep, especially at very small m values. On the other hand, a number of criteria exhibit consistent effects on the average ρ-values in the experimental results with variant point operators. That is, the mean ρ-value increases as n increases. Although the average ρ-value also seems to increase with the number of criteria when fixed point operators are used, this trend is rather unsteady for some m values. In addition, the average ρ-values undergo irregular changes when both m and n are small. At this point, it should be emphasized that the mean ρ-value gradually becomes steady, especially in the case of Algorithm (II), as m and n increase simultaneously. The rank orders betweenPαxj,βxjandQαxj,βxjwith fixed operators exhibit the lowest average Spearman correlation coefficient; the pairPαxj,βxjandQαxj,βxjwith variant operators exhibit the second lowest. On the other hand, the rank orders betweenJαxj,βxj*andHαxj,βxj*with fixed operators exhibit a higher coefficient than the other pairs.A second-order regression model was implemented to examine the effects of the number of alternatives, the number of criteria, the different comparison pairs, the use of fixed and variant point operators, and the employment of the two algorithms on the average Spearman correlation coefficients. Let Γ(J,H) be a dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the correlation coefficient is obtained from the ranking comparison obtained by the proposed method withJαxj,βxjand withHαxj,βxjand 0 otherwise. Let Λ1 be a dummy variable that is equal to 0 or 1 if the fixed point operator or the variant point operator, respectively, is used. Let Λ2 be a dummy variable that is equal to 0 or 1 if Algorithm (I) or Algorithm (II), respectively, is employed.The second-order regression model relates a dependent variable ρ to a set of independent variables involving m, m2, n, n2, Γ(J,H),Γ(J*,H*), Λ1, Λ2, and their interactions, where Γ(P,Q) is chosen arbitrarily as a base. Let ɛ be the random term representing the effects caused by other factors that are not considered in this model. Assume that ɛ is an independent random variable with a finite mean and variance. Thus, the following regression model is considered:(51)ρ=β0+β1m+β2m2+β3n+β4n2+β5mn+β6Γ(J,H)+β7Γ(J,H)m+β8Γ(J,H)n+β9Γ(J*,H*)+β10Γ(J*,H*)m+β11Γ(J*,H*)n+β12Λ1+β13Λ1m+β14Λ1n+β15Λ2+β16Λ2m+β17Λ2n+ε.The total sample size is 1200 (i.e., 10 alternatives×10 criteria×3 pairs of comparisons × 2 parameter settings of point operators×2 algorithms). The results are listed in Table 7. Most of the coefficients are significant at a 90% significance level, except for the variables n, Γ(J,H)n, Λ1, and Λ2n. Overall, the model is significant in terms of the F-test (F=45.975) and has high explanatory power (p-value=0.000). The R2 and adjusted-R2 values are 0.398 and 0.389, respectively.To examine the effects of the number of alternatives (m) and the number of criteria (n) on the correlation between two rankings obtained by the proposed method based on dual optimistic/pessimistic estimations and averaging operations, the partial derivatives of the estimated Spearman correlation coefficient(ρˆ)with respect to m and n are obtained as follows:(52)∂ρˆ∂m=−0.05399+0.005174⋅m−0.001047⋅n−0.012089⋅Γ(J,H)−0.010223⋅Γ(J*,H*)−0.003952⋅Λ1+0.004414⋅Λ2,(53)∂ρˆ∂n=−0.001+0.001168⋅n−0.001047⋅m+0.003979⋅Γ(J,H)+0.007144⋅Γ(J*,H*)+0.015124⋅Λ1+0.001542⋅Λ2.From (52) and (53), it follows that the effects of m and n are negative in general. That is, larger numbers of alternatives or criteria reduce the similarity of the rank orders of alternatives under different parameter settings. With respect to the magnitude of the coefficients, the negative effect of m (−0.05399) is much stronger than that of n (−0.001). However, the negative effects of m and n decrease gradually when their values become large. According to (52), the interaction between m and n is negative, which means that a large n will aggravate the effect of m onρˆ. Similarly, the interaction depicted in (53) indicates that large m values will increase the effect of n onρˆ. Overall, the interaction between m and n is clearly weaker than the other interactions because the absolute value of the coefficient mn is only 0.001047.The effects of m and n vary between the different comparison pairs. As depicted in (52), the negative effect of m onρˆis significantly stronger for the comparison pairs of(Jαxj,βxj,Hαxj,βxj)and(Jαxj,βxj*,Hαxj,βxj*)than that for the pair(Pαxj,βxj,Qαxj,βxj). Additionally, the negative effect of m onρˆis stronger when the variant point operator is used than when the fixed point operator is used but weaker with Algorithm (II) than with Algorithm (I). In contrast, the negative effect of n onρˆbecomes weaker in the pairs(Jαxj,βxj,Hαxj,βxj)and(Jαxj,βxj*,Hαxj,βxj*), as does the use of the variant point operator and Algorithm (II). In summary, the relative effects of m and n are mixed, according to the results of the partial derivatives.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations were proposed within the context of interval-valued fuzzy decisions and several important properties of these operations were examined. This paper presented an approach relating dispositional optimism and pessimism to MCDA using the optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations for aid in decision making. The potential of the proposed method in practical applications was validated using the comparative analysis of a practical medical decision-making problem. Furthermore, a large comprehensive experimental analysis was conducted by considering dual optimistic and pessimistic point operators and parameters in averaging operations.A possible limitation of the proposed method, relative to current MCDA methods, is the setting of parameters required in the optimistic/pessimistic averaging operations. To overcome the difficulty, it is suggested that the decision maker's optimistic and pessimistic traits be measured by employing existing valid and reliable optimism/pessimism scales. Then, it is convenient to designate the parameter values according to the obtained trait scores.There is one further point that deserves explicit emphasis. The proposed method does not require the aggregation of decision information to utilize the same optimistic or pessimistic point operators for each criterion. That is, different criteria can employ distinct point operators to demonstrate their optimistic or pessimistic nature. Although the decision makers’ optimistic or pessimistic traits are generally consistent and enduring, their attitude toward specific criteria might vary considerably because of special needs or motives relevant to criteria. For instance, the viewpoint of lower-level needs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a widely accepted theory of human motivation, is highly resistant to change. In selecting an airline carrier, even a consumer with an optimistic nature may worry over the safety of her trip on an airline with a very poor safety record. It is difficult to wish that consumers place less importance on safety when choosing a carrier. Moreover, it is impossible to force consumers to maintain an optimistic attitude regarding a very poor safety record. The above-mentioned problem can be easily solved by using the method proposed. Suppose that a decision maker wants to choose an alternative that satisfies the criteria A1 (comfort), A2 (economy), and A3 (safety). Assume that the decision maker deems A1 optimistic, A2 neutral, and A3 pessimistic. A feasible solution to cope with this special case is to use the averaging operation under optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic conditions simultaneously. The available suitability functions of the alternative xjare as follows:Jαxj,βxj(A1)⊗κ1,κ2A2⊗κ1,κ2Hαxj,βxj(A3),Jαxj,βxj(A1)⊗κ1,κ2A2⊗κ1,κ2Hαxj,βxj*(A3),Jαxj,βxj(A1)⊗κ1,κ2A2⊗κ1,κ2Qαxj,βxj(A3),Jαxj,βxj*(A1)⊗κ1,κ2A2⊗κ1,κ2Hαxj,βxj(A3),Jαxj,βxj*(A1)⊗κ1,κ2A2⊗κ1,κ2Hαxj,βxj*(A3),Jαxj,βxj*(A1)⊗κ1,κ2A2⊗κ1,κ2Qαxj,βxj(A3),Pαxj,βxj(A1)⊗κ1,κ2A2⊗κ1,κ2Hαxj,βxj(A3),Pαxj,βxj(A1)⊗κ1,κ2A2⊗κ1,κ2Hαxj,βxj*(A3), orPαxj,βxj(A1)⊗κ1,κ2A2⊗κ1,κ2Qαxj,βxj(A3). The proposed model and method are highly flexible and have strong intuitive appeal for application to real-world problems. These new methods not only improve upon existing MCDA methods but may also find new applications of IVFS theory.
