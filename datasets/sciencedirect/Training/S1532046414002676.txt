@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Text mining of scientific literature has been essential for setting up large public biomedical databases, which are being widely used by the research community. In the biomedical domain, the existence of a large number of terminological resources and knowledge bases (KB) has enabled a myriad of machine learning methods for different text mining related tasks. Unfortunately, KBs have not been devised for text mining tasks but for human interpretation, thus performance of KB-based methods is usually lower when compared to supervised machine learning methods. The disadvantage of supervised methods though is they require labeled training data and therefore not useful for large scale biomedical text mining systems. KB-based methods do not have this limitation.In this paper, we describe a novel method to generate word-concept probabilities from a KB, which can serve as a basis for several text mining tasks. This method not only takes into account the underlying patterns within the descriptions contained in the KB but also those in texts available from large unlabeled corpora such as MEDLINE. The parameters of the model have been estimated without training data. Patterns from MEDLINE have been built using MetaMap for entity recognition and related using co-occurrences.The word-concept probabilities were evaluated on the task of word sense disambiguation (WSD). The results showed that our method obtained a higher degree of accuracy than other state-of-the-art approaches when evaluated on the MSH WSD data set. We also evaluated our method on the task of document ranking using MEDLINE citations. These results also showed an increase in performance over existing baseline retrieval approaches.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Text mining of biomedical literature has supported the development of biomedical knowledge bases (KB), which are actively used by the research community [23]. These databases have contributed as well in the development of methods to perform text mining related tasks like entity recognition and relation extraction. There are a large number of KBs available for biomedical text mining purposes. Some of these resources are integrated into the Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS®) [12] and many resources are available from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) foundry [39].1OBO foundry: http://www.obofoundry.org.1Unfortunately, since these resources were not developed to perform text mining tasks, knowledge based methods usually exhibit lower performance compared to ad hoc supervised methods (e.g., supervised classifiers) [20]. Despite this limitation, knowledge based approaches become crucial when either there is a scarcity of labeled data to train supervised methods. Due to the heterogeneity and large scale of biomedical resources, knowledge based methods are becoming more popular.Estimating word-concept probabilities from KBs provides an effective way to support a large range of text mining tasks in the biomedical domain [40]. Unlike supervised methods, the absence of manually labeled data can be alleviated by defining statistical approximations from either the existing data in the KBs (e.g., names, relations and descriptions) or external data such as MEDLINE® abstracts [20]. Other approaches are aimed at building statistical models directly from corpora, like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [11], but it is not clear how to interpret or integrate these models within the KB structures [15].Word sense disambiguation (WSD) and information retrieval (IR) are two tasks that benefit from word-concept probability models. Given an ambiguous word with its context, WSD attempts to select the proper sense given a set of candidate senses. An example of ambiguity is the word cold which could either refer to low temperature or the viral infection. The context in which cold appears is used to disambiguate it. WSD is an intermediate task that supports other tasks such as: information extraction [5], information retrieval and summarization [33]. WSD in the biomedical domain is mostly based on either supervised learning or knowledge based approaches [37]. As previously mentioned, the scarcity of training data makes knowledge based methods preferable to supervised ones.In IR, KB based methods have been proposed for either expanding queries or for performing semantic searches [14,25]. However, these methods do not provide a proper way to combine the expanded words, and just use the KB for defining improved IR queries as we have shown in [25].This work proposes a novel method for generating word-concept statistical models from KBs that can be used directly for both IR and WSD. As mentioned earlier, this method is also able to take advantage of existing data in MEDLINE to produce a model with improved performance. These models can be integrated into IR language models to resolve ambiguity.An implementation of the presented method is available from https://bitbucket.org/ajjimeno/wkpropability.
