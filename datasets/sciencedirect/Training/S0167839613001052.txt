@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We develop a method for computing all the generalized asymptotes of a real plane algebraic curveCimplicitly defined by an irreducible polynomialf(x,y)∈R[x,y]. The approach is based on the notion of perfect curve introduced from the concepts and results presented in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013). In addition, we study some properties concerning perfect curves and in particular, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a plane curve to be perfect. Finally, we show that the equivalent class of generalized asymptotes for a branch of a plane curve can be described as an affine spaceRmfor a certain m.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we considerCan irreducible real plane algebraic curve overCimplicitly defined by an irreducible polynomialf(x,y)∈R[x,y]. That is, we work over the field of complex numbersC, butChas infinitely many points in the affine plane overR. Since every irreducible real curve has a real defining polynomial, we assume thatCis defined by the irreducible polynomialf(x,y)∈R[x,y](see Chapter 7 in Sendra et al., 2007). The assumption of reality is included because of the nature of the problem, but the theory can be similarly developed for the case of complex non-real curves.Under these conditions, we deal with the problem of computing the asymptotes of the infinity branches ofC. This question is very important in the study of real plane algebraic curves because asymptotes contain much of the information about the behavior of the curves in the large. For instance, determining the asymptotes of a curve is an important step in sketching its graph.Intuitively speaking, the asymptotes of some branch of a real plane algebraic curve reflect the status of this branch at the points with sufficiently large coordinates. In analytic geometry, an asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. In some contexts, such as algebraic geometry, an asymptote is defined as a line which is tangent to a curve at infinity.More precisely, letCbe a real plane algebraic curve, and B an infinity branch ofC. A line ℓ is called the asymptote ofCat B, if for everyϵ∈R+, there existsM∈R+such thatd(P,ℓ)<ϵ, for everyP∈Bwith‖P‖>M.If B can be defined by some explicit equation of the formy=f(x)(orx=g(y)), where f (or g) is a continuous function on an infinite interval, it is easy to decide whetherChas an asymptote at B by analyzing the existence of the limits of certain functions whenx→∞(ory→∞). Moreover, if these limits can be computed, we may obtain the equation of the asymptote ofCat B. However, if this branch B is implicitly defined and its equation cannot be converted into an explicit form, both the decision and the computation of the asymptote ofCat B require some others tools.Determining the asymptotes of an implicit algebraic plane curve is a topic considered in many text-books on analysis (see for instance Maxwell, 1962). In Kečkić (2000), is presented a fast and a simple method for obtaining the asymptotes of a curve defined by an irreducible polynomial, with emphasis on second order polynomials. In Zeng (2007), an algorithm for computing all the linear asymptotes of a real plane algebraic curveCimplicitly defined, is obtained. More precisely, one may decide whether a branch ofChas an asymptote, compute all the asymptotes ofC, and determine those branches whose asymptotes are the same. By this algorithm, all the asymptotes ofCmay be represented via polynomial real root isolation.An algebraic plane curve may have more general curves than lines describing the status of a branch at the points with sufficiently large coordinates. This motivates that in this paper, we are interested in analyzing and computing these generalized asymptotes. Intuitively speaking, we say that a curveC˜is a generalized asymptote (or g-asymptote) of another curveCif the distance betweenC˜andCtends to zero as they tend to infinity, andCcannot be approached by a new curve of lower degree.In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing all the g-asymptotes of a real algebraic plane curveCdefined by an irreducible polynomialf(x,y)∈R[x,y]. For this purpose, we use the results in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013), where the notions of convergent branches (that is, branches that get closer as they tend to infinity) and approaching curves are introduced. In addition, in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013), we also provide some results that characterize whether two implicit algebraic plane curves approach each other at the infinity, and we present a method to compare the asymptotic behavior of two curves (i.e., the behavior at the infinity). In particular, we prove that if two plane curves have the same asymptotic behavior, the Hausdorff distance between them is finite. Some of these results are summarized in this paper (see Section 2).The study of approaching curves and convergent branches leads to the notions of perfect curve (a curve of degree d that cannot be approached by any curve of degree less than d) and g-asymptote (a perfect curve that approaches another curve at an infinity branch). These concepts are introduced in Section 3. In this section, we also develop an algorithm that computes a g-asymptote for each infinity branch of a given curve. In Section 4, we provide some necessary and sufficient conditions for a curve to be perfect. In particular, we show that a perfect curve admits a polynomial parametrization. In Section 5, we observe that “proximity” is an equivalence relation for the set of perfect curves. Hence, an infinity branch of a given curve does not have, in general, a unique g-asymptote, but a whole “equivalence class” defined by infinitely many curves. We show that all the curves in a same class have the same degree d, and that any class is isomorphic toRd(d−1)/2. Finally, we present some results that allows us to obtain, under certain assumptions, all the curves within a class.In this section, we introduce the notion of infinity branch, convergent branches and approaching curves, and we obtain some properties which allow us to compare the behavior of two implicit algebraic plane curves at the infinity. For more details on these concepts and results, we refer to Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013).Throughout the paper, we consider an irreducible algebraic affine plane curveCoverCdefined by the irreducible polynomialf(x,y)∈R[x,y]. LetC⁎be its corresponding projective curve defined by the homogeneous polynomialF(x,y,z)=fd(x,y)+zfd−1(x,y)+z2fd−2(x,y)+⋯+zdf0∈R[x,y,z],whered:=deg(C). We assume that(0:1:0)is not an infinity point ofC⁎; otherwise, we may consider a linear change of coordinates.We note that we work overC, but we assume that the curve has infinitely many points in the affine plane overRand then,Chas a real defining polynomial (see Chapter 7 in Sendra et al., 2007). We recall that the assumption of reality is included because of the nature of the problem, but the theory developed in this paper can be applied for the case of complex non-real curves.LetP=(1:m:0),m∈C, be an infinity point ofC⁎, and we consider the curve defined by the polynomialg(y,z)=F(1:y:z). We compute the series expansion for the solutions ofg(y,z)=0. There exist exactlydegY(g)solutions given by different Puiseux series that can be grouped into conjugacy classes. More precisely, ifφ(z)=m+a1zN1/N+a2zN2/N+a3zN3/N+⋯∈C《z》,ai≠0,∀i∈N,whereN∈N,Ni∈N,i=1,…, and0<N1<N2<⋯, is a Puiseux series such thatg(φ(z),z)=0, andν(φ)=N(i.e., N is the ramification index of φ), the seriesφj(z)=m+a1cjN1zN1/N+a2cjN2zN2/N+a3cjN3zN3/N+⋯wherecjN=1,j=1,…,N, are called the conjugates of φ. The set of all (distinct) conjugates of φ is called the conjugacy class of φ, and the number of different conjugates of φ isν(φ)(see Duval, 1989).Sinceg(φ(z),z)=0in some neighborhood ofz=0whereφ(z)converges, there existsM∈R+such thatF(1:φ(t):t)=g(φ(t),t)=0,fort∈Cand|t|<M,which implies thatF(t−1:t−1φ(t):1)=f(t−1,t−1φ(t))=0, fort∈Cand0<|t|<M. We sett−1=z, and we obtain thatf(z,r(z))=0,z∈Cand|z|>M−1,wherer(z)=zφ(z−1)=mz+a1z1−N1/N+a2z1−N2/N+a3z1−N3/N+⋯,ai≠0,∀i∈N,N,Ni∈N,i=1,…, and0<N1<N2<⋯.Reasoning similarly with the N different series in the conjugacy class,φ1,…,φN, we getri(z)=zφi(z−1)=mz+a1ciN1z1−N1/N+a2ciN2z1−N2/N+a3ciN3z1−N3/N+⋯wherec1,…,cNare the N complex roots ofxN=1.Under these conditions, we introduce the following definition of branch.Definition 1An infinity branch of an affine plane curveCassociated to the infinity pointP=(1:m:0),m∈C, is a setB=⋃j=1NLj, whereLj={(z,rj(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M},M∈R+,andrj(z)=zφj(z−1)=mz+a1cjN1z1−N1/N+a2cjN2z1−N2/N+a3cjN3z1−N3/N+⋯whereN,Ni∈N,i=1,…,0<N1<N2<⋯, andcjN=1,j=1,…,N. The subsetsL1,…,LNare called the leaves of the infinity branch B.Remark 1We observe that:1.An infinity branch is uniquely determined from one leaf, up to conjugation. That is, ifB=⋃i=1NLi, whereLi={(z,ri(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>Mi}, andri(z)=zφi(z−1)=mz+a1z1−N1/N+a2z1−N2/N+a3z1−N3/N+⋯thenrj=ri,j=1,…,N, up to conjugation; i.e.rj(z)=zφj(z−1)=mz+a1cjN1z1−N1/N+a2cjN2z1−N2/N+a3cjN3z1−N3/N+⋯whereN,Ni∈N, andcjN=1,j=1,…,N.We may representLi={(z,ri(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M},i=1,…,N, whereM:=max{M1,…,MN}.By abuse of notation, we say that N is the ramification index of the branch B, and we writeν(B)=N. Note that B hasν(B)leaves.Letψ(t):=φ(tN), whereφ(z)is a series expansion for a solution ofg(y,z)=0. Observe that(1:ψ(t):tN)is a local projective parametrization, with center at P, of the projective curveC⁎. Thus, fromψi(t):=φi(tN),i=1,…,N(φiare the N different series in the conjugacy class of φ), we obtain N equivalent local projective parametrizations,(1:ψi(t):tN)(note that they are equivalent sinceφ1,…φNbelong to the same conjugacy class). Therefore, the leaves of B are all associated to a unique infinity place.Conversely, from a given infinity place defined by a local projective parametrization(1:ψ(t):tN)(see Theorem 2.5.3 in Sendra et al., 2007), we obtain N Puiseux series,φj(t)=ψ(cjt1/N),cjN=1, that provide different expressionsrj(z)=zφj(z−1),j=1,…,N. Hence, the infinity branch B is defined by the leavesLi={(z,ri(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M},i=1,…,N.From the above discussion, we deduce that there exists a one-to-one relation between infinity places and infinity branches. In addition, we can say that each infinity branch is associated to a unique infinity point given by the center of the corresponding infinity place. Reciprocally, taking into account the above construction, we get that every infinity point has associated, at least, one infinity branch. Hence, every algebraic plane curve has, at least, one infinity branch. Furthermore, every algebraic plane curve has a finite number of branches.In the following, we introduce the notions of convergent branches and approaching curves. Intuitively speaking, two infinity branches converge if they get closer as they tend to infinity. This concept will allow us to analyze whether two curves approach each other. For further details see Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013).Definition 2Two infinity branches, B andB¯, are convergent if there exist two leavesL={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}⊂BandL¯={(z,r¯(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M¯}⊂B¯such thatlimz→∞(r¯(z)−r(z))=0. In this case, we say that the leaves L andL¯converge.Observe that two convergent infinity branches are associated to the same infinity point (see Remark 4.5 in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz, 2013).In Lemma 1, we characterize the convergence of two given infinity branches (see Lemma 4.2, and Proposition 4.6 in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz, 2013).Lemma 1The following statements hold:•Two leavesL={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}andL¯={(z,r¯(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M¯}are convergent if and only if the terms with non-negative exponent in the seriesr(z)andr¯(z)are the same.Two infinity branches B andB¯are convergent if and only if for each leafL⊂Bthere exists a leafL¯⊂B¯convergent with L, and reciprocally.Note that two convergent branches may be contained in the same curve or they may belong to different curves. In this second case, we will say that these curves approach each other. More precisely, we have the following definition.Definition 3LetCbe an algebraic plane curve with an infinity branch B. We say that a curveC¯approachesCat its infinity branch B if there exists one leafL={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}⊂Bsuch thatlimz→∞d((z,r(z)),C¯)=0.In the following, we state some important results concerning two curves that approach each other. These results are proved in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013) (see Theorem 4.11 and Corollary 4.13).Theorem 1LetCbe a plane algebraic curve with an infinity branch B. A plane algebraic curveC¯approachesCat B if and only ifC¯has an infinity branch,B¯, such that B andB¯are convergent.Remark 2It holds that:1.Relation of “proximity” is a symmetric relation. That is,C¯approachesCat some infinity branch B if and only ifCapproachesC¯at some infinity branchB¯. In the following, we say thatCandC¯approach each other or that they are approaching curves.Two approaching curves have a common infinity point.C¯approachesCat an infinity branch B iff for every leafL={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}⊂B, it holds thatlimz→∞d((z,r(z)),C¯)=0.Corollary 1LetCbe an algebraic plane curve with an infinity branch B. LetC¯1andC¯2be two different curves that approachCat B. Then:1.C¯ihas an infinity branchBi¯that converges with B, fori=1,2.B1¯andB2¯are convergent. Then,C¯1andC¯2approach each other.Taking into account that an infinity branch B is uniquely determined from one leaf, up to conjugation (see statement 1 in Remark 1), and that the results stated above hold for any leaf of B, for the sake of simplicity, in the following,B={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}stands for the infinity branch whose leaves are obtained by conjugation onr(z)=mz+a1z1−N1/N+a2z1−N2/N+a3z1−N3/N+⋯,ai≠0,∀i∈NN,Ni∈N,i=1,…, and0<N1<N2<⋯. We also will prove that the results obtained throughout the paper hold for any leaf.Given an algebraic plane curveCand an infinity branch B ofC, in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz (2013) we analyze whetherCcan be approached at B by a new curveC¯. Intuitively speaking, ifCis approached at B byC¯, anddeg(C¯)<deg(C), one may say thatCdegenerates, sinceCbehaves at the infinity as a curve of less degree.For instance, a hyperbola is a curve of degree 2 that has two real asymptotes, which implies that the hyperbola degenerates, at the infinity, in two lines. The behavior of an ellipse is similar; in this case, the infinity branches are complex but they can also be approached by (complex) lines. However, the asymptotic behavior of a parabola is different, since at the infinity, the parabola cannot be approached by any line. This motivates the following definition.Definition 4A curve of degree d is a perfect curve if it cannot be approached by any curve of degree less than d.A curve that is not perfect can be approached by other curves of less degree. If these curves are perfect, we call them g-asymptotes. More precisely, we have the following definition.Definition 5LetCbe a curve with an infinity branch B. A g-asymptote (generalized asymptote) ofCat B is a perfect curve that approachesCat B.Note that the notion of g-asymptote is similar to the classical concept of asymptote. The difference is that a g-asymptote is not necessarily a line, but a perfect curve. Actually, it is a generalization, since every line is a perfect curve (this fact follows from Definition 4). Thus, the algorithm presented in Section 3.1 also computes the asymptotes being lines (see Example 1). Throughout the paper we refer to g-asymptote simply as asymptote.In order to clarify this notion, let us consider a plane curveCdefined by the irreducible polynomialf(x,y)=−yx−y2−x3+2x2y+x2−2y∈R[x,y].Chas degree 3, and two infinity branches. In Fig. 1, one can check that these infinity branches are approached by the parabolay−2x2+3/2x+15/8=0, and the liney−x/2+1/8=0.Later we see that other plane curves of degree 3, likey−x3=0ory2−x3=0, cannot be approached by any curve of degree less than 3. That is, they are perfect curves.Remark 3The degree of an asymptote is less or equal than the degree of the curve it approaches. In fact, an asymptote of a curveCat a branch B has minimal degree among all the curves that approachCat B. Indeed, letDbe an asymptote ofCat B and letD′be another curve that approachesCat B. From Corollary 1,D′approachesD, and sinceDis perfect, we conclude thatdeg(D′)⩾deg(D).In the following, we show that every infinity branch of a given algebraic plane curve has, at least, one asymptote (see Theorem 2). In order to prove this property, we first need to show some previous results. For this purpose, letCbe a plane curve andB={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}an infinity branch ofCassociated toP=(1:m:0). From Definition 1, we have that(1)r(z)=mz+a1z−N1/N+1+⋯+akz−Nk/N+1+ak+1z−Nk+1/N+1+⋯wherea1,a2,…∈C∖{0},m∈C,N,N1,N2…∈N, and0<N1<N2<⋯. In addition, letNk⩽N<Nk+1, i.e. the termsajz−Nj/N+1withj⩾k+1have negative exponent. Note thatν(B)=N.Lemma 2LetCbe a plane curve containing an infinity branch of the form in(1), and letf(x,y)∈R[x,y]be the irreducible polynomial defining implicitlyC. It holds that(y−mx)Ndividesfd(x,y).ProofLetr1,…,rNbe the conjugates of r. That is,ri(z)=zφi(z−1)=mz+a1ciN1z1−N1/N+a2ciN2z1−N2/N+a3ciN3z1−N3/N+⋯,whereciN=1, andφi,i=1,…,N, are the series expansions for solutions ofg(y,z)=F(1:y:z)=0. Now, we seeg(y,z)as a polynomial in the variable y, and we denote it bygz(y)∈C《z》[y]. From Theorem 4.2 in Verger-Gaugry (2011), we deduce that(y−φi(z))dividesgz(y), fori=1,…,N. Hence,x(y/x−φi(z/x))dividesxdF(1:y/x:z/x)=F(x:y:z)w.r.t. the variable y. In addition, since the factors(y−xφi(z/x))are all different (they are obtained by conjugation), we get that∏i=1N(y−xφi(z/x))dividesF(x:y:z). Observe that sinceφi(x−1)=m+a1ciN1x−N1/N+a2ciN2x−N2/N+a3ciN3x−N3/N+⋯,we get thatx(y/x−φi(z/x))=y−(mx+a1ciN1x1−N1/NzN1/N+a2ciN2x1−N2/NzN2/N+⋯)=y−mx−pi(x,z),wherepi(x,z):=a1ciN1x1−N1/NzN1/N+a2ciN2x1−N2/NzN2/N+⋯,andpi(x,0)=0(note thatNj/N>0,j⩾1). Thus,∏i=1N(y−xφi(z/x))=∏i=1N(y−mx−pi(x,z))dividesF(x:y:z), and if we setz=0, sincepi(x,0)=0, we deduce that∏i=1N(y−mx)=(y−mx)NdividesF(x:y:0)=fd(x,y).  □Remark 4From the proof of Lemma 2, we get thath(x,y):=∏i=1N(y−ri(x))dividesf(x,y)as polynomials in the variable y. Indeed: since∏i=1N(y−xφi(z/x))=∏i=1N(y−mx−pi(x,z))dividesF(x:y:z), we setz=1, and we deduce thath(x,y)dividesf(x,y)w.r.t. the variable y.In the following, we write Eq. (1) defining a branch B as(2)r(z)=mz+a1z−n1/n+1+⋯+akz−nk/n+1+ak+1z−Nk+1/N+1+⋯wheregcd(N,N1,…,Nk)=b,Nj=njb,N=nb,j=1,…,k. That is, we have simplified the non-negative exponents such thatgcd(n,n1,…,nk)=1. Note that0<n1<n2<⋯,nk⩽n, andN<nk+1, i.e. the termsajz−Nj/N+1withj⩾k+1have negative exponent. We denote these terms asA(z):=∑ℓ=k+1∞aℓz−qℓ,qℓ=−Nℓ/N+1∈Q+,ℓ⩾k+1.Under these conditions, we introduce the definition of degree of a branch B as follows:Definition 6LetB={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}defined by (2) an infinity branch associated toP=(1:m:0),m∈C. We say that n is de degree of B, and we denote it bydeg(B).Proposition 1LetC¯be a curve that approachesCat its infinity branch B. Letf¯∈R[x,y]be the implicit polynomial ofC¯. Then,(y−mx)ndivides the homogeneous form of maximum degree off¯(x,y).ProofUsing Theorem 1, we get thatC¯has an infinity branchB¯={(z,r¯(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M¯}convergent withB={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}. From Lemma 1, we deduce that the terms with non-negative exponent in the seriesr(z)andr¯(z)are the same, and henceB¯is a branch of degree n of the form given in (2). Thus, Lemma 2 states that the homogeneous form of maximum degree off¯(x,y)is divided by(y−mx)ν(B¯). Now, the result follows taking into account that, always,deg(B¯)=n⩽ν(B¯). □Remark 5From Lemma 2, we deduce that a curveCcontaining an infinity branch B of degree n has degree at leastν(B¯)⩾n. Furthermore, from Proposition 1, we also have thatdeg(C¯)⩾nfor any curveC¯approachingCat B.Taking into account the results presented above, we have that any curveC¯approachingCat B should have an infinity branchB¯={(z,r¯(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M¯}such that the terms with non-negative exponent inr(z)andr¯(z)are the same. In the simplest case, ifA=0(i.e. there are not terms with negative exponent; see Eq. (2)), we obtain(3)r˜(z)=mz+a1z−n1/n+1+a2z−n2/n+1+⋯+akz−nk/n+1,wherea1,a2,…∈C∖{0},m∈C,n,n1,n2…∈N,gcd(n,n1,…,nk)=1, and0<n1<n2<⋯. Note thatr˜has the same terms with non-negative exponent that r, andr˜does not have terms with negative exponent.LetC˜be the plane curve containing the branchB˜={(z,r˜(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M˜}(note thatC˜is unique since two different algebraic curves have finitely many common points). Observe that(4)Q˜(t)=(tn,mtn+a1tn−n1+⋯+aktn−nk)∈C[t]2,wheren,n1,…,nk∈N,gcd(n,n1,…,nk)=1, and0<n1<⋯<nk, is a polynomial parametrization ofC˜, and it is proper (see Lemma 3). In Theorem 2, we prove thatC˜is an asymptote ofCat B.Lemma 3The parametrization given in(4)is proper (i.e. invertible).Let us assume thatQ˜is not proper. Then, there existsR(t)∈C[t], withdeg(R)=r>1, andQ(t)=(q1(t),q2(t))∈C[t]2, such thatQ(R)=Q˜(see Binder, 1996; Hong and Schicho, 1998 or Manocha and Canny, 1991). In particular, we have thatq1(R(t))=tn, which implies thatq1(t)=(t−R(0))k,andR(t)=tr+R(0),rk=n.Let us considerR⋆(t)=R(t)−R(0)=tr∈C[t], andQ⋆(t)=Q(t+R(0))=(tk,q2⋆(t))=(tk,c0+c1t+c2t2+⋯+cutu)∈C[t]2.Then,Q⋆(R⋆)=Q(R)=Q˜, and in particularq2⋆(R⋆)=q2⋆(tr)=mtn+a1tn−n1+a2tn−n2+⋯+aktn−nk. That is,c0+c1tr+c2t2r+⋯+cutur=mtn+a1tn−n1+a2tn−n2+⋯+aktn−nk.From this equality, and taking into account that r divides n (recall thatrk=n), we deduce that r dividesnj,j=1,…,k. This is impossible, becauser>1, andgcd(n,n1,…,nk)=1. Therefore, we conclude thatQ˜is proper. □The next result states a property concerning the implicit polynomial ofC˜(compare with Lemma 2).Lemma 4LetC˜be the plane curve containing the infinity branch given in(3). Letf˜(x,y)∈R[x,y]be the implicit polynomial definingC˜. It holds that the homogeneous form of maximum degree off˜(x,y)is(y−mx)n.First, we consider the polynomial proper parametrization (see Lemma 3) definingC˜, and introduced in (4):Q˜(t)=(tn,mtn+a1tn−n1+⋯+aktn−nk)∈C[t]2.Now, we distinguish two different cases:1.Ifm=0, i.e. B is associated to the infinity pointP=(1:0:0), we apply the results in Sendra et al. (2007) (see Chapter 4), and one has that, up to constants inR∖{0},f˜(x,y)=resultantt(x−tn,y−p(t))=∏i=1n(y−p(αi))wherep(t)=mtn+a1tn−n1+⋯+aktn−nk, andα1,…,αnare the n roots of the equationx−tn=0. Hence, sincedeg(p)=n−n1, we get that the maximum exponent ofp(αi)is(n−n1)/n<1and then, the form of maximum degree off˜(x,y)isyn.Letm≠0, and then B is associated to the infinity pointP=(1:m:0). In this case, we apply the linear change of variables,x=X−mY,y=mX+Y, and the infinity point moves to(1:0:0). By applying case 1, we get that the homogeneous form of maximum degree off˜(X−mY,mX+Y)isYn. Finally, undoing the change, we get that the homogeneous form of maximum degree off˜(x,y)is(y−mx)n. □Remark 6From Lemma 4, we deduce thatdeg(C˜)=n.Theorem 2The curveC˜is an asymptote ofCat B.ProofTaking into account the construction ofC˜, we have thatC˜approachesCat B. Therefore, we only need to show thatC˜is perfect, i.e. thatC˜cannot be approached by any curve with degree less thandeg(C˜).For this purpose, we first note thatC˜admits the polynomial parametrization given by the form in (4). Then, using the results in Manocha and Canny (1991), we deduce that the unique infinity branch ofC˜isB˜. In addition, we observe that by construction,B˜and B are convergent.Under these conditions, let us consider a plane curve,C¯, that approachesC˜atB˜. From Theorem 1, we get thatC¯has an infinity branchB¯convergent withB˜. SinceB˜and B are convergent, from Corollary 1, we deduce thatB¯and B are convergent which implies thatC¯approachesCat B. Now, from Remarks 5 and 6, we deduce thatdeg(C¯)⩾n=deg(C˜). Therefore, we conclude thatC˜is perfect. □We have shown that, for any infinity branch B of a plane curveC, there always exists an asymptote that approachesCat B. Furthermore, we have provided a method to obtain it. From these results, we obtain the following algorithm that computes an asymptote for each infinity branch of a given plane curve.We assume that we have prepared the input curveC, such that by means of a suitable linear change of coordinates,(0:1:0)is not an infinity point ofC.Correctness. The algorithm Asymptotes Construction outputs an asymptoteC˜that is independent of leaf chosen to define the branchB={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}(see Section 2). Indeed: letC˜be an asymptote obtained by the algorithm, and defined by the proper parametrizationQ˜(t)=(tn,r˜(tn)), wherer˜(z)=mz+a1z−n1/n+1+⋯+akz−nk/n+1,andr(z)=mz+a1z−n1/n+1+⋯+akz−nk/n+1+A(z),A=∑ℓ=k+1∞aℓz−qℓ,qℓ∈Q+,a1,a2,…∈C∖{0},n,n1,…∈N,0<n1<n2<⋯, andgcd(n,n1,…,nk)=1,Nj=njb,N=nb,j=1,…,k(see Eqs. (2) and (3)). Now, letrs(z)=mz+a1csn1bz−n1/n+1+⋯+akcsnkbz−nk/n+1+As(z),As=∑ℓ=k+1∞aℓcsnℓz−qℓ,wherecsN=1,s=1,…,N. That is,rs=r, up to conjugation. Then, the parametrization obtained by algorithm usingrsisQ˜s(t)=(tn,r˜s(tn)), wherer˜s(z)=mz+a1csn1bz−n1/n+1+⋯+akcsnkbz−nk/n+1.SinceQ˜(t)=(tn,r˜(tn))=(tn,mtn+a1t−n1+n+⋯+akz−nk+n),andQ˜s(t)=(tn,r˜s(tn))=(tn,mtn+a1csn1bt−n1+n+⋯+akcsnkbt−nk+n),and taking into account thatcsN=csnb=1, we deduce thatQ˜s(csbt)=Q˜(t). Therefore, both parametrizations,Q˜sandQ˜, define the same asymptoteC˜.In the following, we illustrate algorithm Asymptotes Construction with an example.Example 1LetCbe the curve of degreed=4defined by the irreducible polynomialf(x,y)=2y3x−y4+2y2x−y3−2x3+x2y+3∈R[x,y].We apply algorithm Asymptotes Construction to compute the asymptotes ofC.Step 1:We have thatf4(x,y)=2y3x−y4. Hence, the infinity points areP1=(1:2:0)andP2=(1:0:0).We start by analyzing the pointP1:The only infinity branch associated toP1isB1={(z,r1(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M1}, wherer1(z)=2z+3z−38−9z−464+27z−5512−81z−64096+⋯(we computer1using the algcurves package included in the computer algebra system Maple).We computer˜1(z), and we have thatr˜1(z)=2z.The parametrization of the asymptoteC˜1is given byQ˜1(t)=(t,2t)∈R[t]2, and the polynomial defining implicitlyC˜1isf˜1(x,y)=y−2x∈R[x,y].Now, we focus on the pointP2:The only infinity branch associated toP2isB2={(z,r2(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M2}, wherer2(z)=z2/3−13+z−2/39−2z−4/381+⋯.We obtain thatr˜2(z)=z2/3−13.The parametrization of the asymptoteC˜2is given byQ˜2(t)=(t3,t2−1/3)∈R[t]2, and the polynomial defining implicitlyC˜2isf˜2(x,y)=−x2+y3+y2+1/3y+1/27∈R[x,y].An indispensably tool in the development of the results presented in this paper is the notion of perfect curve. In this section we try to understand better this concept. For this purpose, in the following we show some properties concerning perfect curves. We start with a necessary condition for a curve to be perfect.Proposition 2A perfect curve is polynomial (i.e. it admits a polynomial parametrization).ProofTaking into account the results in Manocha and Canny (1991), one has that a curve is polynomial if and only if it has only one infinity branch. Thus, in order to prove the proposition, we only need to show that a perfect curve cannot have more than one infinity branch.For this purpose, letCbe a perfect curve defined by the polynomialf(x,y), and let us assume thatChas two different infinity branches,Bj={(z,rj(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>Mj},j=1,2, whererjare as in Eq. (1), i.e.r1=m1z+a1z−r1N1+1+a2z−r2N1+1+⋯,r2=m2z+b1z−s1N2+1+b2z−s2N2+1+⋯,andν(Bj)=Nj,j=1,2(see Remark 1).Now, we considerh1(x,y)=∏j=1N1(y−r1,j(x)),h2(x,y)=∏j=1N2(y−r2,j(x))whereri,1(z),…ri,Ni(z)are the conjugates ofri(z),i=1,2. It holds thath1andh2divide f w.r.t. the variable y (see Remark 4). In addition,h1andh2do not have common factors sincer1,iandr2,jbelong to different conjugacy classes for everyi∈{1,…,N1}, andj∈{1,…,N2}. Thus, we deduce thatdeg(C)⩾degy(f)⩾N1+N2>N1⩾n1,wheredeg(B1)=n1.In addition, from Theorem 2, we have thatCcan be approached atB1by an asymptote of degreen1. Therefore, we get thatCis not perfect which contradicts the assumption. Hence, we conclude that a perfect curve cannot have more than one infinity branch. □In the following example, we show that the reciprocal of Proposition 2 is not true. More precisely, we consider a polynomial curveC, and we show thatCis not a perfect curve.Example 2LetCbe the curve defined by the polynomial parametrizationP(t)=(t4+t,t2)∈R[t]2.We compute the implicit polynomial ofCby applying for instance the results in Sendra et al. (2007) (see Chapter 4). We have thatf(x,y)=resultantt(x−t4−t,y−t2)=−y+x2−2xy2+y4∈R[x,y].We apply Algorithm Asymptotes Construction to determine the asymptotes ofC. We first observe thatConly has the infinity pointP=(1:0:0). We compute the infinity branch associated to P (we use the algcurves package included in Maple), and we get thatB={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}, wherer(z)=z1/2+12z−1/4−164z−7/4+1128z−10/4+⋯.Now, we considerr˜(z)=z1/2, and we obtain the asymptoteC˜defined by the parametrizationQ˜(t)=(t2,t). The polynomial defining implicitlyC˜isf˜(x,y)=y2−x.Thus, the curveCthat has degree 4, is approached byC˜that has degree 2. Therefore,Cis not perfect. In Fig. 3, we plotCand the asymptoteC˜.We remark thatC˜approachesCat every leaf of the branch B (see statement 3 in Remark 2). More precisely, B has two real and two complex leaves (see Remark 4.7 in Blasco and Pérez-Díaz, 2013). The real leaves are convergent with the leafr˜1(z)=z1/2of the parabolaC˜, and the complex leaves are convergent with the leafr˜2(z)=−z1/2ofC˜.Proposition 2 states that a perfect curve has only one infinity branch but this condition does not ensure that the curve is perfect. In the following, we provide a characterization of perfect curves (see Proposition 3). For this purpose, we first remark some properties obtained from the definitions and results introduced before.Remark 71.Two approaching perfect curves have the same degree (see Definition 4).Two asymptotes that approach the same branch have the same degree (see statement 1 above and Corollary 1).Any asymptote that approaches a curve at a branch of degree n has degree n (see Remark 6 and Theorem 2).From statement above and Lemma 2, we deduce that if B is a branch of a perfect curve thenν(B)=deg(B).Proposition 3LetCbe an algebraic plane curve of degree n.Cis perfect if and only if it has a unique infinity branch B, anddeg(B)=n.ProofFirst, we assume thatCis perfect. From Proposition 2, we get thatConly has one infinity branch, B. It holds thatdeg(B)⩾n; otherwiseCwould be approached by asymptotes of degree less than n (see Remark 7, statement 3). Moreover, from Remark 5, we get thatdeg(B)⩽n. Thus, we deduce thatdeg(B)=n.Now, letCbe such that it has a unique infinity branch B, anddeg(B)=n. Let us assume thatCis not perfect. Then, there exists a curveC¯, withdeg(C¯)<n, that approachesCat B. From Remark 3, we get that the asymptotes ofCat B have degree less than n, which contradicts Remark 7 (statement 3). Therefore, we conclude thatCis perfect. □Example 3LetCbe the plane curve defined by the irreducible polynomialf(x,y)=yn−xm∈R[x,y],n,m∈N,n>m. Let us prove thatCis perfect. For this purpose, we first observe thatgcd(n,m)=1; otherwise,n=n1k,m=m1k,k⩾2, and(yn1−xm1)divides f which is impossible because f is irreducible.Note thatChas a unique infinity branch B, since it admits the polynomial parametrization(tn,tm). In addition, B is given byr(z)=zm/n, and thusdeg(B)=n. Then, by applying Proposition 3, we conclude thatCis perfect.The following proposition states a sufficient condition for a curve to be perfect, which can be checked without computing any infinity branch. This result will play an important role in Section 5.Proposition 4LetCbe an algebraic plane curve with a unique infinity point P, and let P be regular. ThenCis perfect.ProofLetdeg(C)=d, and we assume thatd⩾2(the case of lines is trivial). Let us prove thatCsatisfies the conditions of Proposition 3; i.e.,Chas a unique infinity branch, say B, anddeg(B)=d.We assume w.l.o.g. thatP=(1:0:0)(otherwise, we apply a linear change of coordinates). Since P is regular, there exists a unique place centered at P and hence, there exists a unique infinity branch associated to P (see Section 2). Therefore the first condition holds.Now, we focus on the second condition. LetB={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M},M∈R+, be the unique infinity branch ofC, wherer(z)=a1z−N1/N+1+⋯+akz−Nk/N+1+ak+1z−Nk+1/N+1+⋯,a1,a2,…∈C∖{0},N,N1,N2…∈N,0<N1<N2<⋯, andNk⩽N<Nk+1(see Eq. (1)). Letgcd(N,N1,…,Nk)=b,Nj=njb,N=nb,j=1,…,k(see Eq. (2)); that is,deg(B)=n(see Definition 6). In the following, we prove thatn=d. For this purpose, we analyze howr(z)is obtained. Letf(x,y)=yd+fd−1(x,y)+fd−2(x,y)+⋯+f1(x,y)+f0,wherefi(x,y)is the homogeneous form of degree i. In addition, letfd−1(x,y)=b0xd−1+b1xd−2y+⋯+bd−2xyd−2+bd−1yd−1,andfd−2(x,y)=c0xd−2+c1xd−3y+⋯+cd−3xyd−3+cd−2yd−2.The projective curve associated toCis given by:F(x:y:z)=yd+zfd−1(x,y)+z2fd−2(x,y)+⋯+zd−1f1(x,y)+zdf0.We observe thatb0≠0. Indeed: sinced⩾2, we note that∂F∂y(P)=∂fd∂y(1,0)=0,and∂F∂z(P)=fd−1(1,0)=b0.Furthermore, from Euler's formula, we have that∂F∂x(P)=0. Then, since P is regular, we deduce thatb0≠0.Under these conditions, in order to computer(z), we consider the polynomial (see Section 2):g(y,z)=F(1:y:z)=yd+zfd−1(1,y)+⋯+zdf0which can be written asg(y,z)=yd+z(b0+b1y+⋯+bd−2yd−2+bd−1yd−1)+z2(c0+c1y+⋯+cd−3yd−3+cd−2yd−2)+⋯.In addition, we have thatr(z)=zφ(z−1), whereφ(z)is a series expansion for a solution ofg(y,z)=F(1:y:z)=0; that is,g(φ(z),z)=0, whereφ(z)=a1zN1/N+a2zN2/N+a3zN3/N+⋯(see Section 2). Hence, the expressiong(φ(z),z)=(a1zN1/N+a2zN2/N+⋯)d+z(b0+b1(a1zN1/N+a2zN2/N+⋯)+b2(a1zN1/N+a2zN2/N+⋯)2+⋯)+z2(c0+c1(a1zN1/N+a2zN2/N+⋯)+c2(a1zN1/N+a2zN2/N+⋯)2+⋯)+⋯vanishes for|z|<M−1which implies that terms with a common exponent must cancel.Sinceb0≠0, the terms with lowest order ing(φ(z),z)areb0zand(a1zN1/N)d=a1dzN1d/N. Thus, they must cancel and then,N=N1dandn=n1d(note thatN=nb, andN1=n1b). Hence, sincen1⩾1, we get thatn⩾d. On the other hand, Remark 5 states thatd⩾N⩾n, son=d.Therefore,Chas a unique infinity branch B, anddeg(B)=d. From Proposition 3, we conclude thatCis a perfect curve.  □Remark 8The reciprocal of Proposition 4 is not true. For instance, the curvey3−x=0is perfect (see Example 3) but its unique infinity point,(1:0:0), is singular.In Section 3, given an algebraic plane curveC, and an infinity branch B ofC, we prove thatCcan be approached by an asymptote at B. In the following, we see that this asymptote may not be unique. In fact, in most of cases, there are infinitely many asymptotes associated to a given infinity branch.For instance, letCbe the curve defined by the polynomialf(x,y)=y2−xand, for eachk∈R, letDkbe the curve defined bygk(x,y)=y2−x+k. It holds thatDkapproachesC, for everyk∈R. Indeed: note that both curves admit a polynomial parametrization, so each of them has only one infinity branch. Furthermore, these branches are defined byr(z)=z1/2, andrk(z)=z1/2−k/(2z1/2)−k2/(8z3/2)+⋯=(z−k)1/2, respectively. Clearly, these branches are convergent, sincelimz→∞(r(z)−rk(z))=0. Thus,{Dk}k∈Rdefines an infinite family of curves that approachCat its unique infinity branch (see Fig. 4).Note that the relation of proximity is actually an equivalence relation for the set of curves having only one infinity branch. Clearly, it is reflexive, since every curve approaches itself. Moreover, statement 1 in Remark 2 ensures the symmetry.Transitivity does not hold for a general set of curves. More precisely, letC1,C2andC3be three plane curves such thatC1approachesC2at an infinity branch B, andC2approachesC3at a different infinity branchB⁎. We cannot get thatC1approachesC3. However, if we consider curves with only one infinity branch, B andB⁎are the same and then,C1approachesC3at B. In this case, transitivity holds and then, we have an equivalence relation for the set of curves having only one infinity branch. In the following, we refer to the equivalence classes associated to this equivalence relation as proximity classes.We observe that this property can be applied to perfect curves since, from Proposition 2, perfect curves only have one infinity branch. That is, we consider the above property restricted to the set of perfect curves and then, given a perfect curveC, the set of perfect curves approachingCdetermines a proximity class. Therefore, the set of asymptotes that approach a curve at a given infinity branch is also a proximity class.In this section, we provide a method that allows, in same cases, to compute the curves in a proximity class. For this purpose, we first introduce the following definition.Definition 7A regular perfect curve is a curve having a unique infinity point, which is regular.From Proposition 4, regular perfect curves are a subset of the set of perfect curves. In the following, we prove a nice property of this subset which will allow us to decide whether two regular perfect curves approach each other by comparing their implicit polynomials.More precisely, Theorem 3 states that a polynomial defining implicitly a regular perfect curve has some irrelevant terms (i.e. terms that do not affect the asymptotic behavior of the curve). If we modify the coefficients of these terms, we obtain a new perfect curve that approaches the original one. Hence, we can construct infinitely many different asymptotes approaching a given plane curve simply by manipulating its irrelevant terms.Theorem 3LetCbe a regular perfect curve defined by an irreducible polynomialf∈R[x,y]of degree d. The asymptotic behavior ofCis completely determined byfdandfd−1.ProofTaking into account Proposition 2, we have thatChas only one infinity branch. LetB={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}be this branch. From Proposition 3, we get thatdeg(B)=dwhich implies thatr(z)can be written asr(z)=mz+a1z1−1/d+a2z1−2/d+⋯+ad−1z1−(d−1)/d+ad+A(z)wherem,a1,a2,…∈C, andA(z)=∑j=d+1∞ajz−qj,qj∈Q+forj⩾d+1. Note that this notation is slightly different from that of (2); here, some coefficientsaimight be zero.In order to describe the asymptotic behavior ofC, we just need to compute the terms with non-negative exponent inr(z). That is, we need to determine the coefficientsm,a1,…,ad. The first of them, m, can be obtained directly from the homogeneous form of maximum degree,fd(x,y)=(y−mx)d. In the following we assume w.l.o.g. thatm=0; that is, B is associated to the infinity pointP=(1:0:0)(otherwise, we apply a linear change of coordinates).The coefficientsa1,a2,…,adcan be obtained by applying the procedure described in the proof of Proposition 4. The condition to be held is thatg(φ(z),z)=0for|z|<M−1, whereφ(z)=zr(z−1)=a1z1/d+a2z2/d+⋯+ad−1z(d−1)/d+adz+zA(z−1).Reasoning as in the proof of Proposition 4, we get that the terms with a common exponent in the expressiong(φ(z),z)=(a1z1/d+a2z2/d+⋯)d+z(b0+b1(a1z1/d+a2z2/d+⋯)+b2(a1z1/d+a2z2/d+⋯)2+⋯)+z2(c0+c1(a1z1/d+a2z2/d+⋯)+c2(a1z1/d+a2z2/d+⋯)2+⋯)+⋯must cancel. In addition, we also have thatb0≠0.First, we consider the terms with minimum exponent. They areb0zanda1dz. Then,b0+a1d=0which implies thata1=(−b0)1/d. We setA1:=a1(A1represents thata1has now a fixed value).We substitute the value ofa1ing(φ(z),z), and we reason similarly to computea2. Note that the termsb0zanda1dzhave been canceled, anda1has a fixed valueA1≠0(note thatb0≠0). Hence, the terms with minimum exponent areb1A1z1+1danddA1d−1a2z1+1d. Then,b1A1+dA1d−1a2=0which implies that the value ofa2is determined fromb1. We have thata2=−b1dA1d−2. We setA2:=a2.Once we havea1anda2, we computea3. For this purpose, we substitute the values ofa1,a2ing(φ(z),z), and the terms with minimum exponent areb2A12,b1A2,(d2)A1d−2A22anddA1d−1a3(all of them are multiplied byz1+2d). Thus, we have thatb2A12+b1A2+(d2)A1d−2A22+dA1d−1a3=0.Again, we obtain an equation wherea3,b2and a set of constants appear. Then, the value ofa3is determined fromb2(we recall thatA1≠0).In the following, we prove that once the values ofaj,j=1,…,i−1, are obtained, reasoning as above, we get an equation whereai,bi−1and a set of constants appear. For this purpose, we first observe that the term with minimum exponent includingaiisdA1d−1aiz1+i−1d, and the term with minimum exponent includingbi−1isbi−1A1i−1z1+i−1d(note thatA1≠0). Hence, both coefficients,aiandbi−1, appear in the equation multiplied byz1+i−1d. The remainder elements involved in this equation are constants computed in the previous steps. Thus,aiis obtained frombi−1.Therefore, we conclude that the asymptotic behavior of the curve is determined by the coefficient m, obtained fromfd(x,y), and the coefficientsb0,b1,…,bd−1, obtained fromfd−1(x,y). □Theorem 3 implies that any modification in the terms of f of degree less or equal tod−2, does not affect the asymptotic behavior of the curve (we refer to them as the irrelevant terms). In addition, from the proof of Theorem 3, we also get that for regular perfect curves, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the coefficientsm,a1,a2,…,ad(that determine the asymptotic behavior of the curve), and the coefficients offdandfd−1. Hence, we deduce the following corollary.Corollary 2Two regular perfect curves approach each other if and only if their terms of degree d andd−1are the same.In the following, we consider two approaching perfect curvesCandC¯. From statement 2 in Remark 2, we have that both curves have a unique common infinity point P. In the next corollary, we prove that P is a regular point ofCiff P is a regular point ofC¯. Thus, we deduce that a perfect curve having a singular infinity point cannot be approached by a regular perfect curve.Corollary 3LetCandC¯be two approaching perfect curves.Cis a regular perfect curve if and only ifC¯is a regular perfect curve.LetCbe defined by the polynomialf(x,y)=(y−mx)d+fd−1(x,y)+fd−2(x,y)+⋯+f1(x,y)+f0wherefi(x,y)is the homogeneous form of degree i, andd⩾2(the case of lines trivially holds). The projective curve associated toCis given byF(x:y:z)=(y−mx)d+zfd−1(x,y)+z2fd−2(x,y)+⋯+zd−1f1(x,y)+zdf0.Thus,∂F∂y(P)=0(d⩾2),∂F∂z(P)=fd−1(1,m), and∂F∂x(P)=0(apply Euler's formula). Then, P is regular if and only iffd−1(1,m)≠0. Finally, the result follows by applying Corollary 2. □Given a regular perfect curveCof degree d defined by a polynomialf(x,y), we may compute all the curves in its proximity class simply by modifying the irrelevant terms in f (see Corollaries 2 and 3).For instance, letCbe the curve defined by the polynomialf(x,y)=x3+3x2y+3xy2+y3+2x2+y−3∈R[x,y].Chas only one infinity point,P=(1:−1:0), which is regular. Thus,Cis a regular perfect curve. The curves within the proximity class ofCare implicitly defined by the polynomialsx3+3x2y+3xy2+y3+2x2+ax+by+c,a,b,c∈R.Note that any curve that belongs to this proximity class can be associated uniquely to a vector(a,b,c)∈R3. This remark motivates the following proposition.Proposition 5LetCbe a regular perfect curve of degree d. The proximity class ofCis isomorphic toR(d−1)d2.From Remark 7, statement 1, we have that all the curves in the same proximity class have the same degree d. Thus, the result follows taking into account that the number of irrelevant terms in a generic polynomial of degree d is(d−1)d2, and that any curve that belongs to this proximity class can be associated uniquely to a vector inR(d−1)d2.  □In the following, we show that Theorem 3 provides a method for computing all the asymptotes of a curveCat an infinity branch B associated to a regular infinity point.Theorem 4LetCbe a plane curve, and P a regular infinity point ofC. Let B be an infinity branch ofCassociated to P, andC˜the asymptote ofCat B obtained from algorithm Asymptotes Construction. It holds that:1.P is a regular point ofC˜.The asymptotes ofCat B are the curves within the proximity class ofC˜.Statement 2 is deduced from Corollary 2. So, in the following, we prove statement 1. For this purpose, letP=(1:0:0)(otherwise, we consider a linear change of variables), anddeg(B)=n. LetB={(z,r(z))∈C2:z∈C,|z|>M}, wherer(z)=a1z1−1/n+a2z1−2/n+⋯+an−1z1−(n−1)/n+an+A(z)a1,a2,…∈C, andA(z)=∑j=n+1∞ajz−qj,qj∈Q+forj⩾n+1(note that this notation is slightly different from that of (2); here, some coefficientsaimight be null). From Algorithm Asymptotes Construction, we get that a proper polynomial parametrization ofC˜is given byQ˜(t)=(q1(t),q2(t))=(tn,a1t−1+n+a2t−2+n+⋯+an)∈C[t]2.Under these conditions, we apply the results in Pérez-Díaz (2007) and Lemma 4, and we have that the multiplicity of the point P inC˜isdeg(C˜)−deg(1q2(t))=n−deg(q2).Taking into account these previous results, we have to prove thatdeg(q2)=n−1, which is equivalent toa1≠0.For this purpose, since P is an infinity point ofC, the projective curve associated toCis given byF(x:y:z)=fd(x,y)+zfd−1(x,y)+z2fd−2(x,y)+⋯+zd−1f1(x,y)+zdf0,wherefd(x,y)=ys∏j=1d−s(y−mjx)=yd+ℓd−1yd−1x+⋯+ℓsysxd−s,s⩾1,fd−1(x,y)=b0xd−1+b1xd−2y+⋯+bd−2xyd−2+bd−1yd−1.Ifs=1, sinces⩾N⩾n(see Lemma 2), we get thatdeg(B)=n=1which implies thatC˜is a line. Thus, P is a regular point inC˜. So, lets⩾2. Then,∂F∂x(P)=0(apply Euler's formula),∂F∂z(P)=fd−1(1,0)=b0, and∂F∂y(P)=∂fd∂y(1,0)=0(s⩾2) which implies that P is a regular point inCif and only ifb0≠0.In the following, we prove thatb0≠0implies thata1≠0and then, the result holds. For this purpose, we observe that the coefficientsa1,a2,…,ancan be obtained by applying the procedure described in the proof of Proposition 4. Sinceg(φ(z),z)=F(1,φ(z),z)=0, whereφ(z)=zr(z−1)=a1z1/n+a2z2/n+⋯+an−1z(n−1)/n+anz+zA(z−1),reasoning as in the proof of Proposition 4, we get that the terms with a common exponent in the expressiong(φ(z),z)=(a1z1/n+a2z2/n+⋯)d+ℓd−1(a1z1/n+a2z2/n+⋯)d−1+⋯+ℓs(a1z1/n+a2z2/n+⋯)s+z(b0+b1(a1z1/n+a2z2/n+⋯)+b2(a1z1/n+a2z2/n+⋯)2+⋯)+⋯must cancel.Ifb0≠0, the first non-zero term with minimum exponent appearing isb0z. Thus, there existsj∈Nsuch thatjs/n=1, andb0+ajs=0, andai=0,i=1,…,j−1. Sincen⩽N⩽s(see Lemma 2), we deduce thatj=1,n=s, anda1=(−b0)1/s≠0, as we wanted to prove. □Remark 9IfC˜is a line, there are no irrelevant terms. In this case the asymptote is unique.In the following, we illustrate these results with an example.Example 4We consider the curveCintroduced in Example 1, and defined by the polynomialf(x,y)=2y3x−y4+2y2x−y3−2x3+x2y+3∈R[x,y].In Example 1, we obtain the asymptoteD˜ofCat the infinity branch B associated to(1:0:0). We get thatD˜is defined by the polynomialf˜(x,y)=y3−x2+y2+1/3y+1/27∈R[x,y].From Proposition 4, we deduce thatD˜is a regular perfect curve, and all the asymptotes ofCat B are the curves defined by polynomialsy3−x2+y2+ax+by+c,a,b,c∈R.These curves determine a proximity class isomorphic toR3(Proposition 5).In Fig. 5, we plotC, and the asymptotesD˜i,i=1,2,3, defined by the polynomialsf˜1(x,y)=y3−x2+y2−y+1/27,f˜2(x,y)=y3−x2+y2+1/3y−2x+1/27,f˜3(x,y)=y3−x2+y2.
