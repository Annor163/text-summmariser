@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Loss of gastrointestinal motility is a significant medical setback for patients who experience abdominal surgery and contributes to the most common reason for prolonged hospital stays. Recent clinical studies suggest that initiating feeding early after abdominal surgery is beneficial. Early feeding is possible when the patients demonstrate bowel motility in the form of bowel sounds (BS). This work provides a data collection, processing and analysis methodology for detection of recovery of gastrointestinal track motility by observing BSs in auscultation recordings. The approach is suitable for real-time long-term continuous monitoring in clinical environments. The system was developed using a Naive Bayesian algorithm for pattern classification, and Minimum Statistics and spectral subtraction for noise attenuation. The solution was tested on 59h of recordings and 94.15% recognition accuracy was observed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Gastrointestinal motility, or peristalsis, indicates the digestive tract׳s ability to contract and is essential for food intake. After major abdominal surgery, a temporary inhibition of gastrointestinal motility occurs. The inhibition duration correlates with the type of anesthesia used and the degree of surgical trauma [1]. In order to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting, a period of fasting is commonly practiced and patients are fed with fluids following the recovery of motility [2].Loss of gastrointestinal motility is a significant medical setback and contributes to the most common reason for delayed hospital discharge. Prolonged hospital stays have economic consequences but more importantly the discomfort experienced by the patients increases significantly. Recent studies suggest that initiation of early postoperative enteral feeding via oral or nasoenteric administration improves wound healing [3], reduces septic morbidity after abdominal trauma [4] and pancreatitis [5]. Early feeding is possible when the patients demonstrate bowel motility in the form of BSs.Auscultation is commonly used for bowel motility assessment in hospital environments. It is easy, safe and requires only a stethoscope. However, due to high workload and lack of expert personnel, frequent patient visits are rarely possible, and feeding may be delayed.Various researchers have investigated automatic detection and classification of BSs. The most promising techniques used for short-term BS analysis are fractal dimension [6], higher order statistics [7], wavelet decomposition [8] and artificial neural network [9]. Studies performed by Dimoulas et.al [10], Kim et.al. [11], Emoto et al. [12] focused on the long-term monitoring and temporal changes of the occurrence of BSs [13]. Hadjileontiadis [14,15] Dimoulas et al. [16] studied signal de-noising and wavelet based noise reduction. Also pioneering study by Dimoulsas et al. [17] used multimodal activity analysis using video surveillance.Although many methods exist, high computational complexity hinders their applicability for real-time continuous processing and sensitivity to interfering noise in clinical environments reduces detection rates. The aim of this work is to propose a complete data collection, signal processing and analysis methodology which is suitable for detection of recovery of gastrointestinal track motility by observing BSs in continuous noisy auscultation recordings. Bowel and other interfering sounds were classified using a Naive Bayesian (NB) algorithm and noise estimation was performed by using Minimum Statistics (MS) and spectral subtraction. Both methods are computationally inexpensive and suitable for real-time processing.This paper is a substantially extended version of the previous conference publication [18] and to the best of author׳s knowledge, there are no other studies on automatic detection of the recovery of gastrointestinal motility after major abdominal surgery. The main differences are detection is addressed as a classification problem, noise level is estimated for each frame, adaptive threshold is used for feature extraction and the system is tested on more subjects.The sound produced by the bowel activity (BA) is usually observed as a non-stationary short-time signal with explosive character, occasionally contaminated by noise and other artifacts such as heartbeat, movement, breathing etc. [19]. The duration of an individual BA is typically between 0.02 and 0.1s. Sound level correlates with the intensity of the bowel movement. Typically, BSs are categorized into two activity classes: single burst (SB) and multiple bursts (MB) [19,20]. SB is result of short duration contractions and creates spiky sounds. MB consists of a cluster of SBs occurring side by side with tiny or no gaps. Quite periods (QP) are observed in the absence of BA or noise. Recent work by Dimoulas et al. [21] suggests a hierarchical taxonomy called abdominal sounds fine classification (ASFC) for abdominal sound pattern analysis and utilizes features of duration, spectral centroid and spectral bandwidth. In this taxonomy, the interfering sounds and noises are classified into five different classes; Additive Broadband Noise (ABN), Respiratory Related Noise (RRN), Movement and Friction Noise (SN), Examination Room Noises (AN) and Heart-Beat related noise (IHS). In this work, different than ASFC taxonomy, the respiratory sounds are also interference and classified as RRN.Fig. 1 depicts the observed sound types and their corresponding spectral signatures.The number of bursts varies between subjects, and physical state. BA occurs approximately every 2–12 s in an irregular pattern. Reduced (hypoactive) bowel activity can be observed during sleep and after use of certain medication. Increased (hyperactive) BA occurs with diarrhea, gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal bleeding and after feeding [22].For clinical environments with various background noises, noise level estimation and attenuation is essential for successful detection of BAs. After testing different techniques, the MS method [23] was considered for noise estimation because it does not use any explicit threshold, is very sensitive to the periodic noise and computationally inexpensive. The MS method is based on the idea that the activity at interest and interfering noise are independent and noise-only signal is frequently observed.Let x be the sum of the background noise bn and a clean signal bs. X, BN and BS represent the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of each signal respectively(1)X(n,k)=BS(n,k)+BN(n,k)where n is the time frame index and k is the frequency-bin index. During QPs, the signal power reduces to the background noise power and by tracking the minimum, it is possible to obtain an accurate noise power estimate [23]. Typically, the following smoothed periodogram P(n,k) is used to obtain the minimum of the local energy(2)P(n,k)=αP(n−1,k)+(1−α)|X(n,k)|2where α is the smoothing parameter, a value between 0 and 1. Finally, the noise power is estimated by searching the minimum value within a finite window length (L) as follows:(3)λmin,N(n,k)=min[P(n,k),P(n−1,k)..P(n−L,k)]where min is the minimum operator. The minimum statistics typically underestimates the noise power and requires a bias compensation factor. The unbiased noise power estimator is given by the following:(4)λ^NMS(n,k)=Bmin(n,k)λmin,N(n,k)where Bmin(n,k) is the bias compensation factor (BCF). Comprehensive studies on noise power spectral estimation and spectral subtraction can be found in [23–25].
