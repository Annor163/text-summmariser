A new pathological tremor signal prediction algorithm for tremor suppression, the adaptive multiple oscillators linear combiner (AMOLC) based on Hopf oscillator, is proposed in this paper. This method can be used to predict pathological tremor signal with high accuracy and well robustness. An experimental platform is built to simulate the tremor motion to obtain the optimum parameters of AMOLC algorithm. Furthermore, AMOLC algorithm is applied to tremor prediction for actual pathological tremor patients. Results verify that chosen model parameters indeed improve the prediction performance which meets the demand of tremor suppression with high accuracy and well robustness. A comparison of computational complexity is conducted between some existing prediction methods and AMOLC.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Pathological tremor is a nervous disorder disease, defined as a roughly sinusoidal, or oscillatory, involuntary motion [1]. The major types of diseases caused by pathological tremor are Parkinson's disease (PD) and Essential tremor (ET) [2]. Pathological tremor presents high amplitude and broad frequency range with 2–14Hz, which is not life-threatening. However, it will cause a great inconvenience for daily life of patients who have pathological tremor [3]. The origin of pathological tremor has been studied for a long time, but it is still unknown. Deep brain stimulations (DBS), biomechanical loading and Functional electrical stimulation (FES) are major methods to assist pathological tremor patients [4–8].The external assistive devices like the biomechanical loading or FES are controlled by tremor signals to compensate tremor. Therefore, extraction of tremor signals, estimation of tremor signals and prediction of tremor signals are vital to tremor suppression. For extraction of tremor signals, traditional linear filter will inevitably introduce the phase lag which will affect the effectiveness of tremor suppression. An adaptive band-pass filter (ABPF) was designed to extract tremor without phase lag in the center frequency of the filter [9]. However, the bandwidth of the filter must be limited in a rather narrow range around the center frequency. Recently, researchers proposed some adaptive algorithms to extract tremor signal from the raw signals. Veluvolu proposed a bandlimited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) combined with the least mean square (LMS) [10]. In [11], an auto-regressive moving-average (ARMA) model is proposed to model voluntary motion. Veluvolu proposed BMFLC with recursive least squares (RLS) and Kalman Filter (KF) for accurate tremor estimation and extraction [12]. The tremor estimation accuracy of BMFLC with Kalman Filter is high, however, it requires the prior knowledge of tremor characteristics of patients (such as the bandwidth and frequency range). A Hilbert–Huang-Based tremor removal method was proposed to extract the tremor signals without priori-knowledge [13–15], but the ability of online computation had to be improved. In terms of estimation of tremor signals, the weighted Fourier linear combiner (WFLC) algorithm was proposed to model any quasi-periodic signal as a modulating sinusoid and track its dominant frequency, amplitude and phase [16–18]. However, it can only track one dominant frequency of tremor signal and its track performance will become bad if the tremor signal has more than one dominant frequency or the frequency of the signal changes quickly. As for the prediction of tremor signals, the prediction of tremor signal plays a very important role in controlling tremor suppression equipments in real time. The autoregressive Model (AR) and Kalman filter (KF) was proposed to predict the physiological tremor for robotics applications with 81±3% average prediction accuracy [19,20]. Since, physiological tremor is different from pathological tremor, a new prediction algorithm is necessary for the prediction of pathological tremor.In the course of pathological tremor suppression, prediction of tremor signal of next time makes the tremor suppression equipment obtain tremor signal corresponding next time in advance, which can improve real time performance of tremor suppression equipment. The block diagram of tremor suppression system is shown in Fig. 1. If tremor signal of time k+1 can be obtained by prediction algorithm based on the actual tremor signalθ¯kand the predicted tremor signal∑i=1Mθˆkof time k, the tremor suppression equipment can get the tremor signal of time k+1 in advance to prepare to generate the anti-tremor motion of time k+1.This work aims at proposing a new prediction algorithm for pathological tremor signal in real time. This adaptive multiple oscillators linear combiner (AMOLC) prediction algorithm is based on the Hopf oscillator. Nonlinear oscillators have been widely used to model various physical and biological processes [21–27]. In [25], a programmable central pattern generators based on nonlinear oscillators was applied to biped locomotion control. The adapted Hopf oscillator was used as a state estimator to detect the user motion intention in [28]. Zhang et al. built a tremor suppression controller based on neural oscillator in [29]. However, no researchers have ever considered using the nonlinear oscillator to predict tremor signal.In this paper, the AMOLC prediction algorithm is proposed to predict the pathological tremor signal. To improve the prediction accuracy of AMOLC algorithm, the Powell search algorithm is introduced to search corresponding optimum parameters. The AMOLC algorithm is used to predict the simulated pathological signals from experimental platform to obtain corresponding optimum parameters first. In the prediction of actual pathological tremor signals, the rationality of corresponding optimal parameters is verified and the accuracy of AMOCL is 84.39%±1.70%, which meets the tremor suppression equipment's demand with high prediction accuracy and well robustness.
