@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An efficient computational method is developed for large-displacement and small-strain analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials which are often found in civil, composite and biological engineering. Based on the parametric variational principle (PVP), a unified constitutive equation of 3D bi-modulus materials is proposed to deal with the problem of numerical instability. The small-strain bi-modulus problem is transformed into a standard linear complementarity problem that can be solved easily by the classic Lemke׳s algorithm. By using the co-rotational approach, the local PVP formulation is combined with an existing co-rotational formulation and a new tangent stiffness matrix, including a parametric variable, is derived for geometrically nonlinear analysis. Traditional stress iteration is not required for calculation of the nodal internal force when the Newton–Raphson scheme or Arc-length method is employed to solve the material and geometric nonlinear problem. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is improved greatly in contrast to the traditionally iterative solution. Also, the proposed algorithm is used to simulate a unilateral contact behavior of staggered bio-composites and the effective elasticity modulus of composites is determined accurately.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Some materials, such as concrete, polymer and composites, usually exhibit different mechanical responses in tension and compression in that they have different tensile and compressive moduli [1–3]. This kind of material is usually called bi-modulus material which has been reported in a lot of literature and monograph. For instance, a test shows that a certain granule concrete, made of quartzite and Portland cement, is a typical bi-modulus whose tensile modulus isE−=6.50×103MPaand compressive modulus isE−=1.82×104MPa. A glass-reinforced fiber exhibits significantly different mechanical behaviors in tension and compression and the value ofE+/E−is close to eight at room temperature [4]. Similar phenomena were observed in a damaged brittle material containing micro-cracks [5], aged polycrystalline NiTi alloys [6] and some bio-materials composed of soft organisms and hard minerals [7].Mechanical analysis of bi-modulus materials is out of the scope of classical elasticity theory in solid mechanics which assumes material has the same moduli in tension and compression [8,9]. A great error cannot be ignored as the classical elasticity theory is used to analyze the mechanical behavior of bi-modulus materials, especially when the value ofE+/E−is far from 1. The new stress–strain relationships and elasticity theory were developed by some researchers for bi-modulus materials. Jones [10] and Vijayakumar and Rao [11] proposed different stress–strain relationships for composites with different stiffness in tension and compression. Subsequently, the stress–strain relationship of bi-modulus materials was simplified as a bilinear model as shown inFig. 1, which plays an important role on the later analytical and numerical solutions [4]. Some analytical solutions of bi-modulus materials can be found [12,13], but they are limited to simple and regular structures such as beams and columns, which are subjected to idealized loads and constraints.Numerical analysis based on the finite element method (FEM) is a useful way for the complicated engineering structures made of bi-modulus materials. Zhang and Wang proposed the finite element formulation for a planar bi-modulus structure with a circle hole and they pointed out that the convergence was poor when using traditional iterative schemes to solve the nonlinear equation [14]. To improve the convergence, Yang and Zhu proposed a smoothing technique, which can be applied to solve 2D static bi-modulus problem [15] and also 1D dynamic and inverse problems [16,17]. Although convergence of the algorithm is improved by the smoothing technique, it still depends on the determination of parameters in the smoothing function. He et al. discussed and revealed the reason why the traditional Newton–Raphson scheme was not stable for a 2D bi-modulus problem and proposed a more proper shear modulus to improve the convergence [18], only with modest success.Recently, a quadratic programming method based on the PVP was developed for nonlinear analysis of bi-modulus truss and tensegrity structures [19]. The PVP method improves the convergence very well and has been demonstrated by numerical tests of the 1D bi-modulus problem, involving in both the small- and large-displacement analyses. Then the PVP formulation was extended to the 2D bi-modulus continuum by Zhang et al. and good convergence of the algorithm was also found [20]. In addition, a series of functional formulations, based on the minimum complementary energy principle, Hellinger–Reissner type mixed variational principle and Hu–Washizu type generalized variational principle, respectively, were proposed by Du and Guo for 3D bi-modulus materials while the elastic bounds of bio-composites were estimated accurately [21]. However, the work is limited to the small-deformation framework. To the authors׳ knowledge, geometrically nonlinear analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials is rarely seen. It is necessary to develop an efficient computational method for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials, which includes both material and geometric nonlinearities. Convergence of the algorithm also needs to be investigated for this issue.The object of this paper is to develop an efficient computational method, which is based on the parametric variational principle and the co-rotational approach, for large-displacement and small-strain analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The non-smooth stress–strain relationship of 3D bi-modulus materials is introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, a unified PVP constitutive equation is proposed in principal stress directions and the principle of minimum potential energy is established for small deformation analysis. In Section 4, the PVP formulation for small-deformation analysis is combined with the co-rotational approach to achieve the geometrically nonlinear analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials and then the PVP finite element formulation including incompatible modes is also presented. In Section 5, two numerical examples are employed to investigate the validity and convergence of the proposed PVP-CR algorithm. A novel application for staggered bio-composites is presented, too. Some conclusions are drawn in the final section.The same as the classical elasticity that has the same moduli in tension and compression, the equilibrium equation and strain–displacement relationship of 3D bi-modulus materials are given by(1)Aσ+b=0(2)ε=Luwhereεandσare strain and stress vectors, respectively.uis a displacement vector andbis a body force vector.LandAare differential operators,(3)A=LT=[∂∂x00∂∂y0∂∂z0∂∂y0∂∂x∂∂z000∂∂z0∂∂y∂∂x]However, the constitutive equation of 3D bi-modulus elasticity is different from the one of classical elasticity. The stress–strain relationship of bi-modulus materials is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that material has a tensile modulusE+when it is in tension, while has a compressive modulusE−when in compression. There is a nondifferentiable point on the constitutive curve, which leads to strain discontinuity. The constitutive equation of 3D bi-modulus materials is established in principal stress directions, which are marked byxI,yIandzI, as shown inFig. 2.O−xIyIzIis the coordinate system of principal stresses, whileO−xyzis the coordinate system of stresses.With principal strain and stress vectors denoted byεIandσI, respectively, and a flexibility matrix in principal stress directions denoted byaI, the constitutive equation of 3D bi-modulus materials in the principal coordinate systemO−xIyIzIcan be written as(4)εI=aIσIorσI=DIεIwhere(5)εI=[εαεβεγ]T(6)σI=[σασβσγ]T(7)aI=DI−1=[aααaαβaαγaβαaββaβγaγαaγβaγγ]εi(i=α,β,γ)represents three principal strains andσi(i=α,β,γ)represents three principal stresses.DIis the elasticity matrix in principal stress directions. Elements in matrixaIare flexibility coefficients which are determined by the signs of principal stresses. Particularly for 3D bi-modulus materials, there are eight principal stress states that are determined by(8){aii=1E+,σi>0aii=1E−,σi<0(i=α,β,γ)(9){aij=−ν+E+,σj>0aij=−ν−E−,σj<0(i,j=α,β,γ;i≠j)whereν+is a tensile Poisson׳s ratio andν−is a compressive Poisson׳s ratio. Moreover, a recognized assumption based on experimental data,ν+/E+=ν−/E−, is used to ensure the symmetry of flexibility and elasticity matrices [4].Eq. (4) is the stress–stain relationship established in principal stress directions. Using the transformation from the principal coordinate systemO−xIyIzIto the coordinate systemO−xyz,(10)εI=Qε(11)σI=Qσthe constitutive equation in the coordinate systemO−xyzcan be given by(12)σ=Dεwhere(13)D=QTDIQ(14)Q=[l12m12n12m1n1n1l1l1m1l22m22n22m2n2n2l2l2m2l32m32n32m3n3n3l3l3m3]in whichli,miandni(i=1,2,3)are direction cosines of axesxI,yIandzIin the coordinate systemO−xyz. From Eqs. (4), (8) and (9), it can be found that the stress–strain relationship of 3D bi-modulus materials depends on the principal stress states. Strain discontinuity and absence of the shear modulus in Eq. (7) often cause troubles in traditional iterative solutions [14,15,17,19]. In fact, strain discontinuity may be dealt with a unified constitutive equation, which can describe the eight principal stress states indicated by Eqs. (8) and (9), in order to improve the convergence of the algorithm. To achieve this goal, the PVP for 3D bi-modulus materials will be proposed in the following section.There are two cases to be considered, includingE+<E−andE+>E−. We can take an arbitrary case to present the detailed derivation. In the case ofE+<E−, the flexibility matrixaIcan always be determined by selecting compressive modulusE−and Poisson׳s ratioν−for the eight principal stress states indicated by Eqs. (8) and (9). Three parametric variablesλα,λβandλγin the three principal stress directions can be introduced into Eq. (4) and a new unified constitutive equation for the eight principal stress states are given by(15){εαεβεγ}=[1E−−ν−E−−ν−E−−ν−E−1E−−ν−E−−ν−E−−ν−E−1E−]{σασβσγ}+{λαλβλγ}In addition, to keep the equivalence between Eq. (15) and Eqs. (4), (8) and (9), three complementarity equations need to be introduced in the three principal stress directions. The complementarity equations are given by(16)E+E−E−−E+λα={0,σα<0σα,σα≥0(17)E+E−E−−E+λβ={0,σβ<0σβ,σβ≥0(18)E+E−E−−E+λγ={0,σγ<0σγ,σγ≥0ForE+<E−, it is obvious thatE−−E+>0. Thus it is definite thatλα,λβandλγare always greater than or equal to zero. In fact,λαrepresents the difference betweenσαE+andσαE−, whenE−is selected as the assumed modulus for the principal stress stateσα>0. Therefore,λα>0means that material is in tension in the principal stress directionxIandλα=0means that material is in compression.λβandλγhave similar physical meanings toλα. From the above discussion, the eight principal stress states can be indicated by values ofλα,λβandλγ, such as(a)λα>0,λβ>0,λγ>0, material is in tension along the directions ofxI,yIandzI;λα=0,λβ=0,λγ=0, material is in compression along the directions ofxI,yIandzI;λα>0,λβ=0,λγ=0, material is in tension along the direction ofxI, while in compression along the directions ofyIandzI;λα>0,λβ=0,λγ>0, material is in tension along the directions ofxIandzI, while in compression along the direction ofyI;λα>0,λβ>0,λγ=0, material is in tension along the directions ofxIandyI, while in compression along the direction ofzI;λα=0,λβ=0,λγ>0, material is in tension along the direction ofzI, while in compression along the directions ofxIandyI;λα>0,λβ=0,λγ=0, material is in tension along the direction ofxI, while in compression along the directions ofyIandzI;λα=0,λβ>0,λγ=0, material is in tension along the direction ofyI, while in compression along the directions ofxIandzI.Introducing slack variablesνα,νβandνγinto Eqs. (16)–(18), respectively, the complementarity equations can be expressed as(19)σI−E+E−E−−E+λ+ν=0(20)λi≥0,νi≥0,λiνi=0(i=α,β,γ)where(21)λ=[λαλβλγ]T,ν=[νανβνγ]TEq. (19) is the governing equation, which indicates the stress–strain relationship and Eq. (20) is a complementary condition, which indicates the principal stress states. The new unified constitutive equation consists of Eqs. (19) and (20). Substituting Eq. (15) into Eq. (19), it yields(22)DI−εI−(E+E−E−−E+I+DI−)λ+ν=0where(23)I=[100010001],DI−=[1E−−ν−E−−ν−E−−ν−E−1E−−ν−E−−ν−E−−ν−E−1E−]−1In the case ofE+>E−, similar derivation can be achieved. Combing the two cases,E+<E−andE+>E−, the unified constitutive equation is rewritten as(24a)sDI−εI−(sδI+DI−)λ+ν=0(24b)λi≥0,νi≥0,λiνi=0(i=α,β,γ)where(25)s=sign(E−−E+),δ=E+E−E−−E+(26)sign(a)={+1,ifa>0−1,ifa<0The unified PVP constitutive equation of 3D bi-modulus materials has been derived so far. Now the eight principal stress states and stress–strain relationships are indicated by the new constitutive equation, Eq. (24a), and the additional complementary equation, Eq. (24b). In the next section, the principle of minimum potential energy with parametric variables will be proposed for numerical analysis with the FEM.Strain energy of a bi-modulus continuum can be formulated in the principal coordinate systemO−xIyIzI, where strain energy density can be given by(27)ϕ=12(εI−sλ)TDI−(εI−sλ)Substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (27), it yields(28)ϕ=12(Qε−sλ)TDI−(Qε−sλ)Combining with Eq. (24), the principle of minimum potential energy with parametric variables can be formulated as follows:(29a)min.∏[λ(∙)]=12∫Ω[(QLu−sλ)TDI−(QLu−sλ)]dV−∫ΩuTbdV−∫SuTpdS(29b)s.t.sDI−εI−(sδI+DI−)λ+ν=0(29c)λi≥0,νi≥0,λiνi=0(i=α,β,γ)Note that the parametric variableλdoes not take part in the variational calculation [25], when variation is performed to get the equilibrium equation. The difference between the conventional variational principle (CVP) and the parametric variational principle (PVP) is illustrated inFig. 3. Eqs. (29a) and (29b) show that the slack variableνis complementary to the parametric variableλ. It is not difficult to prove that the solution of Eq. (29) is the real displacement of 3D bi-modulus materials subjected to a definite force and displacement boundary. We refer readers to Ref. [22] for the detailed proof on PVP of an elasto-plastic problem which is similar to the one of the bi-modulus problem discussed in this paper.With the strain, element stiffness, coordinate transformation and shape function matrices denoted byB,Ke,QeandNrespectively, the discretized formulation of potential energy for one element can be given by(30)Πe=∫Ωe[12(QeBqe−sλe)TDI−(QeBqe−sλe)−qeTNTfe]dV=12qeTKeqe−qeTWeλe−qeTfewhere(31)B=LN,Ke=∫ΩeBTD−BdV,We=s∫ΩeBTQeTDI−dVBased on the PVP, variation of Eq. (30) yields(32)qe=Ke−1(Weλe+fe)On the other hand, the discretized complementarity equation of the element is given by(33)sDI−QeBqe−(sδI+DI−)λe+νe=0λe≥0,νe≥0,λeνe=0Eq. (32) is the finite element equilibrium equation within the small deformation framework and Eq. (33) indicates a standard LCP that can be solved by mature methods, such as Lemke׳s algorithm, interior- and non-interior-point methods [23]. The nodal displacement vectorqecan be obtained once the parametric variableλeis calculated by Eq. (33).In this section, the PVP formulation for small deformation analysis presented above is combined with a co-rotational formulation, developed by Moita and Crisfield [24]. A new tangent stiffness matrix, including a parametric variable, is derived based on the parametric variational principle and the co-rotational approach that has been proved efficient for a large-rotation problem [25–28].The coordinate systems and variables are introduced prior to the presentation of detailed derivation. Two coordinate systems and three configurations are illustrated inFig. 4, where O-XYZ is a fixed global coordinate system andO-XlYlZlis a local coordinate system which is convected with the eight-node isoparametric brick element. The initial unit vectors(i1,i2,i3)locating on the local co-ordinate system changes to(e1,e2,e3)via a rigid body rotation and translation. By the co-rotational approach [25], a large deformation from configuration I to III is divided into two steps. The first step refers to a large rigid body motion from the configuration I to II in the global coordinate system O-XYZ; the second step refers to a pure small deformation from configuration II to III in the local coordinate systemO-XlYlZl. Thus the PVP finite element formulation for the small deformation analysis can be used in the local coordinate system as the co-rotational approach is carried out, and then the local formulation can be mapped into the global formulation by transformation from the local to global coordinate system. In the following derivation, the subscript ‘l’ indicates the variables defined in the local coordinate system, while ‘g’ indicates those defined in the global coordinate system.The transformation relation between the local and global nodal internal force vectors of the one element can be given by(34)fge=TeTfleThe transformation is also available for the incremental local and global nodal displacement vectors,(35)δqle=TeδqgeTeis the transformation matrix which will be presented explicitly later. In Eq. (34), the local nodal internal force can be calculated by the small deformation formulation, Eq. (32), and it is given by(36)fle=Kleqle−WleλleHere all the variables are denoted by adding a subscript ‘l’ to indicate that they are defined and used in the local coordinate system. The tangent stiffness matrix can be derived by the variation of Eq. (34),(37)δfge=TeTδfle+δTeTfleFirstly, we deal with the first term on the right side. Substitute Eq. (36) into the first term and the variation is performed by the PVP which rules that the parametric variableλledoes not take part in the variation. Thus we can obtain(38)TeTδfle=TeTKleδqleUsing Eq. (35), we obtain(39)TeTδfle=TeTKleTeδqgeSo the first part of the tangent stiffness matrix is given by(40)Kte1=TeTKleTeSubsequently, we focus on the second term on the right side of Eq. (37), which produces another part of the tangent stiffness matrix, i.e.,Kt2. The detailed derivation ofKt2has been presented by Moita and Crisfield [24]. Here we just list those formulations which are useful for this work. The transformation matrixTein Eq. (34) is given by(41)Te=diag(RT)+zeveTwhere(42)R=[e1e2e3]Ris a3×3rotation matrix rotating the initial base vectors(i1,i2,i3)into(e1,e2,e3)(form the configuration I to II) which represents the local coordinate system. In fact,Rcan be calculated by the polar decompositionF=RU, made at the centroid of the element.Fand U are the deformation-gradient and stretch matrices, respectively. Using the rotation matrixR, the local nodal displacement that produces strain can be obtained by(43)qlei=RTxgei1−Xleiin which(44)xgei1=xgei−xge1=[xgei−xge1,ygei−yge1,zgei−zge1]T(xgei,ygei,zgei)is the global coordinate of the nodeion the configuration III andXleiis the local coordinate of the nodeion the configuration II. The global nodal coordinate vectorxgeof the element can be obtained by the following relationship,(45)xge=Xge+qgewhereXgeandqgeare the global coordinate vector on the configuration I and the global displacement vector from the configuration I to III. In Eq. (41),veis a24×3matrix,(46)veT=−[AlTze]−1AlT[diag(RT)]in which(47)ze=col(zi)(48)zi=RT[0−(zgei−zge1)ygei−yge1zgei−zge10−(xgei−xge1)−(ygei−yge1)xgei−xge10]The denotation ‘col’ represents arrangingzi(i=1,2,3,...,8)as a column vector.Alis a24×3matrix and is given by(49)Al=row(Ali)(50)Ali=[0−(J31−1hξi+J32−1hηi+J33−1hζi)J21−1hξi+J22−1hηi+J23−1hζiJ31−1hξi+J32−1hηi+J33−1hζi0−(J11−1hξi+J12−1hηi+J13−1hζi)−(J21−1hξi+J22−1hηi+J23−1hζi)J11−1hξi+J12−1hηi+J13−1hζi0]whereJ−1is the inverse of the Jacobian matrix which is calculated at the centroid of the element.hξi,hηiandhζiare the shape functions at the nodei. The denotation ‘row’ indicates to arrangeAli(i=1,2,3,...,8)as a row vector.The second term of Eq. (37) is manipulated by the variation, which yields(51)δTeTfle=δ[diag(R)+vezeT]fleFor the node i, the first term on the right side of Eq. (51) can be written as(52)δRflei=S(f¯lei)TveTδfgeiwhere(53)f¯lei=RfleiS(•)is an operator transforming the column vectorf¯leiinto a skew-symmetric matrix, i.e.,(54)S=[0−f¯le,zif¯le,yif¯le,zi0−f¯le,xi−f¯le,yif¯le,xi0]f¯le,xi,f¯le,yiandf¯le,ziare the three components of the vectorf¯lei.The second term on the right side of Eq. (51) is given by(55)δ(vezeT)fle=veδzeTfle+δvezeTfleDerivation for the first term of Eq. (55) yields(56)veδzeTfle=ve∑j=1nS(f¯lei)δqgi+ve∑j=1nS(xgi1)S(f¯lei)veTδqgIn addition, the second term of Eq. (55) is proved to be zero at equilibrium [24], so another part of the tangent stiffness matrix can be directly given by(57)Kte2=−col[S(f¯lei)]veT+verow[S(f¯lei)]+vesym∑j=1n[S(xgi1)S(f¯lei)]veTNote that the parametric variableλeis included implicitly in the above formulation because off¯lei=Rfleiandfle=Kleqle−Wleλle, which suggests that in the Newton iteration, the local stiffness matrixKledoesn׳t need to be updated according to the current principal stress states. Instead the parametric variableλeis calculated to get the tangent stiffness matrix and the local nodal force.The incremental finite element equilibrium equation of the structure is given by(58)Ktδqg=Fext−Fintwhere(59)Kt=∑e=1NE(Kte1+Kte2)Fextis the global nodal external force andFintis the global nodal internal force which can be obtained by(60)Fint=∑e=1NETeTfle=∑e=1NETeT(Kleqle−Wleλle)Shear locking occurs when an eight-node brick element is used to analyze a bending dominated problem and it can be eliminated by using incompatible shape functions [29]. The PVP finite element formulation including incompatible modes is presented here, which will be used in the numerical examples behind. The displacement interpolation can be rewritten by adding an additional shape function,(61)u=Nqe+N*αwhere(62)N*=[h*000h*000h*],h*=[1−ξ21−η21−ζ2]αis an additional displacement vector including nine incompatible displacement modes that can be condensed. Thus the local PVP finite element formulation, Eq. (32), can be rewritten as(63)qle=K¯le−1(W¯leλle+fle)where(64)K¯le=Kle−KuαKαα−1Kαu,W¯le=Wle−KleKαα−1Wle*in which(65)Kuα=∫ΩeB*TD−BdV,Kαα=∫ΩeB*TD−B*dV,Wle*=s∫ΩeB*TQeTDI−dVandB*=LN*.Flow chart of the finite element procedure of the PVP-CR algorithm is shown inFig. 5. It can be seen that the local stiffness matrix doesn׳t need to be updated by the current principal stress state when the global tangent stiffness matrix and the local nodal force are calculated. A local linear complementarity problem is solved firstly at the element level to get the parametric variableλleand then the incremental equilibrium equation is solved by the Newton–Raphson scheme in the global coordinate system. The procedure stops if the convergence tolerance‖Fext−Fint‖‖Fext‖<ψis achieved. The tolerance is set to beψ=1×10−5and applied to all the numerical examples. In addition, flow chart of the arc length procedure combined with the proposed PVP method (can be called PVP-CR-Arc algorithm) is presented inFig. 6 to deal with snap-through or snap-back problems. Here the superscriptidenotes the load incremental step, whilejdenotes the iteration step. Details of the arc length procedure can be found in the monograph by Crisfield [33].An L-frame made of bi-modulus material is analyzed in this example. The size and mesh information of the structure are shown inFig. 7 where the left surface of the horizontal beam is fixed and the top surface of the vertical column is subject to a traction force which is transformed into equivalent nodal forces and imposed at these nodes on the top surface. All the parameters are dimensionless. The tensile modulus of the material isE+=1×108and the value ofE+/E−is set to 1:1, 1:10, 1:20, 10:1 and 20:1, respectively. The point M (0.577, 0.577, 0.577) is a selective integration point of the element.First of all, geometrically nonlinear analysis of the structure with the same moduli in tension and compression(E+=E−=1×108)is achieved by both the proposed PVP-CR algorithm and the commercial software ABAQUS. The load–displacement curves are plotted inFig. 8, where the horizontal axis represents the load and the vertical axis represents the horizontal displacement at the central node on the top surface of the vertical column. It can be seen that the two results are in a good agreement and are smaller than the linear elastic analysis. Then the cases with different values ofE+/E−, which cannot be solved directly by ABAQUS, are analyzed using the proposed PVP-CR algorithm. The conventional modified Newton–Raphson scheme, called MNR-CR here, is also employed to solve the problem both including material and geometric nonlinearities, in order to verify the validity and convergence of algorithms.The results of displacement(E+/E−=10:1)obtained by PVP-CR and MNR-CR algorithms are plotted inFig. 9, whereΔFdenotes the load increment between two adjacent load steps. Obviously, the results obtained by the PVP-CR algorithm with a small load stepΔF=6agree with the ones obtained by a large load step,ΔF=60. In addition, forΔF=6the MNR-CR algorithm produces the same results with the PVP-CR algorithm at the beginning of loading, but it aborts after only several load steps.To investigate the convergence of algorithms, convergence curves in the first load step are presented inFig. 10. From Fig. 10(a), it can be seen that both the two algorithms converge successfully in the first load step when the load increment isΔF=6, and the proposed PVP-CR algorithm requires less iterations than the MNR-CR algorithm. However, Fig. 10(b) and (c) show that the MNR-CR algorithm fails to converge as a large load increment is adopted. As shown in Fig. 10(b), oscillation is observed for the MNR-CR algorithm withΔF=60and Fig. 10(c) shows that the MNR-CR algorithm diverges dramatically after several iterations as a larger load stepΔF=600is adopted. In contrast to the MNR-CR algorithm, the proposed PVP-CR algorithm shows a stable convergence behavior and can achieve the convergence tolerance via a few iterations for all the three cases with different load increments.Load–displacement curves of the structure are plotted inFig. 11 and von Mises stress curves are plotted inFig. 12. Three typical deformed shapes of the structure obtained by the PVP-CR algorithm are plotted inFig. 13, where the external load at the central node on the top surface is up to 6000. Von Mises stress contours are shown inFig. 14. It is visible that the smaller the compressive modulus, the larger the deformation, because the compressive resistance of the material reduces with the decrease of compressive modulus. The distribution of von Mises stress of bi-modulus structures are obviously different from those of classical structures which has the same moduli in tension and compression, which demonstrates that the necessity of applying the bi-modulus elasticity theory to the mechanical analysis of bi-modulus structures with a large value ofE+/E−.The bi-modulus cylindrical thin shell shown inFig. 15 is studied by a combination of the PVP-CR algorithm with the arc-length procedure (PVP-CR-Arc algorithm). A quarter of the shell is discretized by using 32(4×4×2)eight-node isoparametric brick elements which include incompatible modes and a concentrated forceFis applied at the central pointA. The size and material property of the structure are selected from the work by Moita and Crisfield [24], in which the cylindrical shell with the same moduli in tension and compression was analyzed. The radius of the cylinder isR=2540mm, the length isl=508mm, the angle theta isθ=0.1radand the thickness ist=12.7mm. The tensile modulus and Poisson׳s ratio areE+=3105N/mm2andv+=0.3. The value ofE+/E−is set to be 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 5:1 and 10:1.The load–displacement curves obtained by the proposed PVP-CR-Arc algorithm and the commercial software ANSYS respectively are plotted inFig. 16, when the case ofE+=E−is considered. As can be form above, the results obtained by using the brick element, including incompatible modes, agree with the ones obtained by using the shell element. Load–displacement curves of the node A of the structure with different compressive moduli are shown inFig. 17 and the limited load for compression is listed inTable 1, which suggests that the limited load decreases approximately linearly with the increase of the value ofE+/E−.Note that the traditional Newton–Raphson scheme embedded in the arc length procedure fails to converge in this example.As a natural load-bearing bio-composite material with staggered microstructures, nacre has received much attention for recent years [21,30–32]. The microstructure of the nacre scanned by the electric mirror is shown inFig. 18, which can be simplified as a ‘brick-mortar’ model shown inFig. 19(a). Fig. 19(b) shows a typical representative volume element of the periodic structure. The gap between the mineral materials extends when the structure is in tension, as shown in Fig. 19(c), while the mineral materials contact as the structure is in compression, as shown in Fig. 19(d). This phenomenon is usually called the unilateral contact.Evans et al. studied the mechanical responses of the nacre and revealed that nacre is of bi-modularity due to the unilateral contact behavior that occurs when the structure is in compression [30]. Ji and Gao proposed an analytical model to determine the effective modulus [31] and Bertodli et al. improved this model and simulated the mechanical responses of the nacre, using the boundary element method (BEM) to achieve a hard contact analysis [7]. Recently, Du and Guo substituted a simple bi-modulus spring model for the hard contact analysis to simulate the unilateral contact behavior. The upper and lower bounds of the staggered bio-composite material are determined by the variational method [21].In this example, the unilateral contact behavior observed in the microstructure of nacre is simulated by a multi-phase bi-modulus material model and the effective moduli of the staggered bio-composite material are determined by the proposed algorithm. Half of the ‘brick-mortar’ structure shown in Fig. 19(b) is discretized by 414(23×18×1)elements and the left edge of the finite element model is subjected to a symmetric displacement constraint, as shown inFig. 20.The model consists of three-phase materials including mineral, organism and bi-modulus materials. The Young׳s moduli of the mineral and organism materials areEm=100GPaandEoranges from 1 to 10GPa. The tensile and compressive moduli of bi-modulus materials areE+=0.1GPaandE−=1000GPa[21]. Poisson׳s ratio of materials is 0.33. The volume of the mineral material occupies 90% of all the materials and the widths of the mineral and organic materials arehm=0.5μmandho=20nm. Numerical simulations for the uniaxial tension and compression are performed by the proposed PVP-CR algorithm and then the effective moduli of the bio-composite can be calculated byE¯=R¯/Δ, in whichE¯is the effective modulus,Δis the forced displacement on the free edge andR¯is the effective action force on the constrained edge.The effective moduli of tension and compression denoted byE¯1tandE¯1crespectively are presented inFig. 21. The subscript ‘1’ represents the direction paralleling to the load. It can be seen that the effective moduli obtained by the FEM proposed in this paper agree with the ones obtained by the analytical model proposed by Bertoldi et al. [7]. In addition, the results obtained by the FEM locate between the upper (the red line) and lower (the blue line) bounds, predicated by Du and Guo [21] using a variational method, as shown inFig. 22. The result is also in a good agreement with the ones in Ref. [21]. This example thus demonstrates the validity of using the bi-modulus material model to simulate the unilateral contact behavior of staggered bio-composite like nacre or other materials with micro-cracks.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper develops an efficient computational method for large-displacement and small-strain analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials. The material nonlinearity is dealt with the parametric variational principle and geometric nonlinearity is formulated by the co-rotational approach that decomposes a large deformation into a rigid body motion in the global coordinate system and a pure small deformation in the local coordinate system. A unified PVP constitutive equation is proposed in the local coordinate system to overcome numerical instability which is caused by strain discontinuity, so that the traditional stress iteration is not required. The proposed PVP-CR algorithm does not require selection of the elastic modulus by the signs of principal stresses while the local stiffness matrix does not require updating when calculating the global stiffness matrix and the nodal internal force. Compared with the traditional iterative solution, the PVP-CR algorithm shows good convergence and can deal with a large load step successfully. Numerical examples indicate that the mechanical responses of bi-modulus materials are apparently different from the ones of classical structures with the same moduli in tension and compression. In addition, the proposed algorithm is successfully used to simulate the unilateral contact behavior of microscopic staggered bio-composites, which suggests that the bi-modulus stress–strain relationship can be used as a model of hard contact. Experimental verification is necessary in future.The proposed method can be extended to geometrically nonlinear analysis of anisotropic bi-modulus composites.
