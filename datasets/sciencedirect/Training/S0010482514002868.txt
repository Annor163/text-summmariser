BackgroundDecompression sickness (DCS) in rats is commonly modelled as a binary outcome. The present study aimed to develop a ternary model of predicting probability of DCS in rats, (as no-DCS, survivable-DCS or death), based upon the compression/decompression profile and physiological characteristics of each rat.MethodsA literature search identified dive profiles with outcomes no-DCS, survivable-DCS or death by DCS. Inclusion criteria were that at least one rat was represented in each DCS status, not treated with drugs or simulated ascent to altitude, that strain, sex, breathing gases and compression/decompression profile were described and that weight was reported. A dataset was compiled (n=1602 rats) from 15 studies using 22 dive profiles and two strains of both sexes. Inert gas pressures in five compartments were estimated. Using ordinal logistic regression, model-fit of the calibration dataset was optimised by maximum log likelihood. Two validation datasets assessed model robustness.ResultsIn the interpolation dataset the model predicted 10/15 cases of nDCS, 3/3 sDCS and 2/2 dDCS, totalling 15/20 (75% accuracy) and 18.5/20 (92.5%) were within 95% confidence intervals. Mean weight in the extrapolation dataset was more than 2SD outside of the calibration dataset and the probability of each outcome was not predictable.DiscussionThis model is reliable for the prediction of DCS status providing the dive profile and rat characteristics are within the range of parameters used to optimise the model. The addition of data with a wider range of parameters should improve the applicability of the model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Animal models offer alternatives to human studies into decompression sickness (DCS) that are both ethically preferable for speculative research and logistically convenient. Prawns, mice, rabbits, dogs, goats, pigs and primates have all contributed to mankind׳s understanding of DCS but the leading role in animal model research surely belongs to the laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus. Pressure exposures designed to elicit DCS in only a proportion of rats vary in depth, time at maximum exposure, breathing gas, rates of compression/decompression and other parameters. Treatments and/or risk factors are then typically evaluated by the degree of difference in the proportion of animals that are diagnosed with DCS following decompression [1].DCS in the rat has been variously defined and diagnostic criteria include survival time, [2–4] observable signs such as walking difficulties [3,5–14], paralysis, [5–19] rolling in a rotating cage [5–9,12,13,15,16,20], twitching/convulsions [5–9,12,13,15,16] and/or respiratory distress [5–7,9–11,13,14,17–19]. Objective measures have been proposed, in particular observable or audible bubble grades [10,21,22]. Only rarely have objective measures been correlated with subjective observer agreement. Recently a promising grip-score test was found significantly associated (p=0.004) with observable signs of what was assumed to have been DCS [23]. Unexpectedly, based upon the correlation between loss of grip strength and perceived DCS, Buzzacott et al. discovered the post-decompression probability of any asymptomatic rat having DCS was 0.5. The precise diagnosis of DCS in the rat, therefore, remains a desirable goal.In almost all studies to date DCS in the rat has been modelled as either the probability of no-DCS vs. DCS [9,12,15,16,24,25], or of Dead vs. Alive [4,11]. Occasionally both models will be sequentially used in the same study but without delineating the relative probabilities of each DCS status [5,26]. To our knowledge only one study has used ordinal logistic regression for ternary DCS outcomes in rats, for an assessment of the effects of ascent rate and post-dive exercise [27]. In this study Pollard and colleagues used ordinal logistic regression to model the probability p of a DCS outcome state j (either no-DCS, survivable-DCS or death), given i independent covariatesx1:nwith respective coefficients β1:n, as(1)Ln(pj1−pj)=α̲+∑inβixiwhere α=[α1, α2,…, αk] is a vector of intercepts (one less than the number of outcome states). For k+1 states, the probability of the ith observation being in state j is given in Eq. 2.(2)Pr[DCS=j|xi]={Pr[DCS≤1|xi]j=1Pr[DCS≤j|xi]−Pr[DCS≤j−1|xi]1<j≤k1−Pr[DCS≤k]j=k+1The present study aimed to develop a ternary model of predicting the probability of DCS in rats, (as either no DCS, survivable DCS or death), based upon compression/decompression profile-dependent inert gas compartment pressure estimates, after adjustment for sex, weight and strain.
