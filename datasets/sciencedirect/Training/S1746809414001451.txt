BackgroundIn clinical practice, longitudinal data can be used to find trend patterns of pathema progress, such as tumour progress, along a time axis. This kind of data can be treated as time-series data. The maximum common sub-sequence is the most common method for calculating similarity of time-series data; and each point is normally treated as having the same weight. However, not all points of data within the time series should be given the same importance. According to clinical experience, the later period sub-sequence (closer to death) has a more significant effect than earlier periods in a trend analysis.ResultsA weighted-similarity measure based on LCSS with Constraint Window (W-LCSS-CW) Method is proposed. The results obtained from the time-series data using different weighting factors are discussed. In a study of non-small cell lung cancer using time-series data, the relative evaluation method and external evaluation method were adopted to calculate cluster effect. The results show that the proposed method, W-LCSS-CW, can improve clustering performance significantly. Clustering performance of various methods was performed using a comparison of (Cindex/Mindex). The proposed W-LCSS-CW Method was evaluated to 1.55 which was 37.02%, 48.01%, 49.64% higher than other common methods (Euclidean, DTW, STS) respectively.ConclusionsThe proposed W-LCSS-CW Method is recommended for monitoring time-series data of tumour patients because the incorporated weighting factor provides more convincing cluster results for medical assist support.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The results of this study suggest that the proposed W-LCSS-CS Method which combines traditional LCSS with a positional weighting factor and a search-scope constraint window can be used to efficiently analyze a pair of data series for similarity. Based on this improved similarity measurement method, the issue of data type and data length are both solved, especially for targeting clinical follow-up data which indicate different cancer progress trends. Also, the search scope is limited, significantly reducing the search time. Thus, the cluster results obtained can assist support and can forecast medical trends. This method is particularly suitable for accurate forecasting of tumour progress in new cancer patients, as well as in other fields, such as financial data tendency and traffic flow prediction.LYF carried out the proposed method and drafted the manuscript.
