@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The recent significant growth of electronic devices endowed with video cameras [1] has resulted in an important demand for new machine vision application tools [2]. To perform high-level tasks (e.g., tracking, classification, event analysis, or augmented reality) these tools include, as a key step, a moving object detection strategy [3]. Owing to the importance of these strategies, several approaches have been proposed [4] to efficiently detect moving objects.Some algorithms aim to reduce the memory requirements and to maximize the speed [5], providing successful results for short sequences with simple backgrounds [6]. However, they do not provide satisfactory results in complex scenarios with illumination changes, shadows, or dynamic backgrounds [7].To improve the quality of the detections in complex scenarios, several multimodal strategies have been proposed [8]. One key multimodal method is the Mixture of Gaussians (MoGs) model proposed by Stauffer and Grimson [9], which makes use of a mixture of several Gaussians to obtain an adaptive model of each image pixel [10]. Other popular multimodal methods are those using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [11], which model the background variations by representing the changes in the scene with different states (day or night, lights on or lights off, etc.).Although these methods are able to provide high-quality detections in many scenarios, they fail in environments where the pixel statistics cannot be described parametrically [12]. To improve the quality of the results in these environments, several moving object detection strategies using non-parametric kernel density estimation methods have been developed [13]. Instead of considering the values of the pixels as a particular distribution, these methods obtain probabilistic models from sets of recent reference samples [14].Among non-parametric strategies, a significant number of spatio-temporal background–foreground modeling approaches [15] have been recently proposed to improve the quality of the detections in sequences recorded with non-completely static cameras or containing non-static background regions [16]. These approaches construct both models (background and foreground) by using spatio-temporal reference data [17]. In this way, they improve the quality of the detections provided by other non-parametric methods [18]. However, since these strategies have associated very high memory and computational costs [19], they carry out some simplifications that reduce the quality of the background modeling. They model the background with fixed bandwidth matrices [16], decreasing the quality of the estimations and forcing to manually set appropriate bandwidth values depending on the characteristics of each sequence. Furthermore, instead of applying the selective mechanisms used by other strategies to update the background model, they use blind mechanisms [14], which significantly increase the amount of misdetections.In this paper, we propose a real-time high-quality background modeling that is suitable for integration into any moving object detection strategy based on spatio-temporal non-parametric modeling. We robustly estimate the bandwidth of the kernels from spatially weighted distributions of the differences of reference samples for consecutive images. Additionally, we apply a novel mechanism to efficiently update the background model, which applies to each reference sample a weight factor determining its influence in the modeling.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the state of the art corresponding to the most relevant work in kernel bandwidth estimation (Section 2.1) and background update (Section 2.2). Section 3 introduces the notation corresponding to the moving object detection strategies based on non-parametric modeling. Section 4 describes the method proposed to dynamically estimate the bandwidth of the kernels. Section 5 presents the algorithm proposed to update the background model. Finally, Sections 6 and 7 present, respectively, the obtained results and the conclusions.
