@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The cure fraction models have been widely used to analyze survival data in which a proportion of the individuals is not susceptible to the event of interest. In this article, we introduce a bivariate model for survival data with a cure fraction based on the three-parameter generalized Lindley distribution. The joint distribution of the survival times is obtained by using copula functions. We consider three types of copula function models, the Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern (FGM), Clayton and Gumbel–Barnett copulas. The model is implemented under a Bayesian framework, where the parameter estimation is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. To illustrate the utility of the model, we consider an application to a real data set related to an invasive cervical cancer study.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Scientific articles in the health field involving time-to-event data commonly utilize statistical hypothesis tests, such as the log-rank or Wilcoxon non-parametric tests to compare survival curves [1], or the Cox proportional hazard model [2] to analyse the effects of independent variables on the survival time. However, more complex situations may require more complex statistical modelling. As a special case, there are practical situations for which a fraction of individuals is not expected to experience the event of interest, while the traditional approaches for survival analysis assume that all individuals under study are susceptible to the event and will timely experience it if followed by a sufficiently long period. For such cases, the survival regression models in presence of a cure fraction are a good option to be fitted by the data [3]. Many papers have been introduced in the literature related to this type of model. In this way, Farewell [4] introduced a mixed-model analysis based on the maximum likelihood method considering data with long-term survivors. Kuk and Chen [5] proposed a generalization of Farewell's model [4] using a Cox proportional hazards model for the susceptible individuals, and Sy and Taylor [6] introduced a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of the regression parameters in this model assuming a non-parametric form of the likelihood and an EM algorithm. Chen and Ibrahim [7] introduced maximum likelihood methods for parameter estimation of semiparametric survival models with a cure fraction, in which the covariates are allowed to be missing.Parametric cure fraction models were introduced by authors such as Cantor and Shuster [8], based on the Gompertz distribution. Lambert et al. [9] extended the cure fraction model based on the Weibull distribution to incorporate background mortality rates so that the cure fraction can be modelled in population-based cancer studies. More recently, many authors have developed parametric models based on distributions with more than two parameters. As recent examples in this direction, we can mention the extended family of the generalized gamma distribution [10] and the generalized modified Weibull distribution [11,12]. Some common distributions used in lifetime data analysis are special cases of these generalized distributions which can provide a considerable flexibility to fit many different shapes for the hazard function.The presence of multivariate lifetimes [13,14] subjected to censoring and cure fractions is other aspect of survival analysis that has drawn attention of many researchers. In medical applications, we can find several situations involving multiple time-to-event data, such as the classical example of the Diabetic Retinopathy Study reported by Huster et al. [15], a study aimed to analyse the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation in delaying the onset of blindness in patients with diabetic. One eye of each patient was randomly selected to receive a treatment and the other eye was observed without treatment. Thus, the event of interest is the time of loss of visual acuity in each of the eyes of the patients. In the statistical literature, this data set was used by many authors to illustrate the use of new approaches to modelling bivariate time-to-event data [16–18]. Recently, copula models have become widely used for modelling multivariate survival data [9,17,19–22]. In a simplified sense, copulas are functions that connect univariate distribution functions to form a multivariate distribution [23].In the present article, we introduce a bivariate model for survival data based on the three-parameter generalized Lindley distribution [24] in presence of cure fraction and censored data. Under a Bayesian approach, this model is based on copula functions and the parameter estimation is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods. In Section 2, we describe the Lindley distribution, its three-parameter generalization and the bivariate mixture cure fraction model based on this distribution. In Section 3 we describe the Bayesian analysis for the proposed model. In Section 4 we introduce a real data set obtained from an invasive cervical cancer study and the obtained results of the Bayesian analysis for this data considering the proposed model. We also consider the application of the model to the data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study reported by Huster et al. [15]. In Section 5 we present a discussion of the obtained results.The one parameter Lindley distribution was introduced in 1958 as a useful tool to analyse lifetime data in modelling stress-strength reliability applications [25]. This distribution is specified for the lifetime T by the probability density function(1)f0(t)=θ21+θ(1+t)e−θt,t>0,where θ>0 is a scale parameter and t is an observation of the random variable T. The corresponding survival function is given by(2)S0(t)=1+θt1+θe−θtand the monotonically increasing hazard function is given byh0(t)=f0(t)S0(t)=θ2(1+t)1+θ(1+t).Fig. 1plots the survival and hazard functions of the Lindley distribution for some parameter values. The statistical properties of the Lindley distribution were studied by Ghitany et al. [26], including their moments, characteristic function and maximum likelihood estimation. These authors also showed that this distribution could be better fitted by some data sets when compared to the standard one parameter exponential distribution. In recent years, the Lindley distribution has been receiving the interest of many authors. Gupta and Singh [27] studied the problem of estimation of the parameters of the Lindley distribution in presence of hybrid censored lifetimes. Mazucheli and Achcar [28] introduced a competing risk model assuming that the causes of failures follow a Lindley distribution. Krishna and Kumar [29] discussed the estimation of the parameter of the Lindley distribution considering data subject to a progressive type-II censoring scheme. Shanker et al. [30] proposed a two-parameter Lindley distribution for modelling waiting and survival times data.In a recent paper, Zakerzadeh and Dolati [24] introduced a three-parameter family of distributions which generalizes the Lindley distribution. The generalized Lindley distribution is a continuous random variable with probability density function given by(3)f0(t)=θ2(θt)α−1(α+βt)e−θt(β+θ)Γ(α+1),t>0,where Γ(a) is the gamma function given byΓ(a)=∫0∞sa−1e−sdsand α, β and θ are positive parameters. We can note that when α=1 and β=1, the expression (3) reduces to the density function of the Lindley distribution with parameter θ, given by Eq. (1). In addition, when β=0, the expression (3) reduces to the density function of the gamma distribution with parameters α and θ. Considering the generalized Lindley distribution, the survival function is given by(4)S0(t)=1−F0(t)=1−P(T≤t)=1−∫0tθα+1sα−1(α+βs)e−θs(β+θ)Γ(α+1)ds=1−αθγ(α,θt)+βγ(α+1,θt)(β+θ)Γ(α+1),where γ(a, b) is the lower incomplete gamma function given byγ(a,b)=∫0bsa−1e−sds. We can note thatlimb→∞γ(a,b)=Γ(a)and, consequently, the propertylimt→∞S0(t)=0is satisfied. We also observe that there is no closed form for the integrals in the survival function (4).In Fig. 2, we have the plots of the hazard function h0(t) of the generalized Lindley distribution for different parameter values. We can note that h0(t) is increasing for α≥1 and β>0; h0(t) is bathtub shaped for α<1 and β>0; h0(t) is decreasing for α<1 and β=0, and h0(t) is constant for α=1 and β=0. In this way, we have a great flexibility of fit.The survival function of the standard mixture cure fraction model has the form(5)S(t)=p+(1−p)S0(t)=1−(1−p)F0(t),where p is a parameter which represents the proportion of “long-term survivors” or “cured” individuals, regarding the event of interest (0<p<1), S0(t) is the baseline survival function for the uncured individuals and F0(t)=1−S0(t) is the cumulative distribution function. In this model, the population is thus a mixture of susceptible and nonsusceptible individuals. We can note that if t tends to infinity, then S(t) tends to p. In this way, the survival function has an asymptote at the cure fraction p. The probability density function for the lifetime T is(6)f(t)=dF(t)dt=(1−p)f0(t),where F(t)=1−S(t) and f0(t) is the baseline probability density function for the susceptible individuals. Let δibe an indicator of censoring for the ith individual, with δi=1 for the uncensored time and δi=0 for the censored time. Considering right censored data and non-informative censoring, the likelihood function based on a sample (ti, δi), i=1, …, n, is(7)L=∏i=1n[f(ti)]δi[S(ti)]1−δi=∏i=1n[(1−p)f0(ti)]δi[p+(1−p)S0(t)]1−δi.Alternatively, non-mixture cure fraction models were proposed by Tsodikov et al. [31], but these models are beyond the scope of this paper. Many works on modelling survival data long-term survivors are introduced in the literature, and interested readers can refer, for example, to Achcar et al. [32], Cancho et al. [33], Maller and Zhou [34], Sposto [35], among many others.Let us assume two lifetimes T1 and T2 associated to the same individual. From the expression (5), the marginal survival functions are given respectively by(8)S1(t1)=p1+(1−p1)S01(t1)and(9)S2(t2)=p2+(1−p2)S02(t2),where pkis the cure fraction related to the lifetime Tkand S0k(tk) is the survival function for the susceptible individuals in Tk, k=1, 2. Let V1 and V2 be two indicator variables such that Vk=1 for a susceptible individual in the lifetime Tkand Vk=0 for a cured individual in Tk, k=1, 2. Thus, P(Vk=0)=pkand P(Vk=1)=1−pk. Depending on the susceptibility pattern, the observed data for any individual fall into one of the following cases:(a)The individual is not susceptible to both events of interest. The associated probability is ϕ00=P(V1=0, V2=0)=P(V1=0)P(V2=0)+cov(V1, V2)=p1p2+ω.The individual is not susceptible to event 1 but is susceptible to event 2. The associated probability is ϕ10=P(V1=1, V2=0)=P(V1=1)P(V2=0)−cov(V1, V2)=p1(1−p2)−ω.The individual is susceptible to event 1 but not to event 2. The associated probability is ϕ01=P(V1=0, V2=1)=P(V1=0)P(V2=1)−cov(V1, V2)=(1−p1)p2−ω.The individual is susceptible to both events. The associated probability is ϕ11=P(V1=1, V2=1)=P(V1=1)P(V2=1)+cov(V1, V2)=(1−p1)(1−p2)+ω.In these expressions, ω=cov(V1, V2) denotes the covariance between V1 and V2, such that 0≤ω≤min(p1, p2)−p1p2. The parameter ω takes the value zero when we have independence between the probabilities of cure associated to the lifetimes T1 and T2. We can note that ϕ11+ϕ10+ϕ01+ϕ00=1, ϕ00+ϕ01=p1 and ϕ00+ϕ10=p2. In addition, if ϕ11=1 and ϕ10=ϕ01=ϕ00=0, we have p1=p2=0 and consequently ω=0, or say, all individuals are susceptible to both events.From the expressions (8) and (9), the joint long-term survival function is given by(10)S(t1,t2)=p1p2+p1(1−p2)S01(t1)+(1−p1)p2S02(t2)+(1−p1)(1−p2)S012(t1,t2)=ϕ00+ϕ10S01(t1)+ϕ01S02(t2)+ϕ11S012(t1,t2),where S012(t1, t2) is the joint survival function for the susceptible individuals to both events [36,37] and, from the expression (4), the baseline marginal survival function S0k(tk) is given by(11)S0k(tk)=1−αkθkγ(αk,θktk)+βkγ(αk+1,θktk)(βk+θk)Γ(αk+1),k=1,2,…where α1, α2, β1, β2, θ1 and θ2 are unknown positive parameters.Let us suppose that either T1 and T2 can be censored and that censoring is independent of the time to the events considered by the study researchers. Considering a random sample of size n, each ith observation (i=1, …, n) can be classified into one of four groups:(a)C1: both t1iand t2iare complete observations, or say, they are uncensored lifetimes;C2: t1iis a complete observation and t2iis a censored lifetime;C3: t1iis a censored lifetime and t2iis a complete observation;C4: both t1iand t2iare censored lifetimes.Thus, the likelihood function is given byL=∏i∈C1∂2S(t1i,t2i)∂t1i∂t2i∏i∈C2−∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t1i∏i∈C3−∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t2i∏i∈C4S(t1i,t2i).Let us define two indicator variables, denoted by δ1iand δ2i, where δji=1 if tjiis an observed lifetime and δji=0 if tjiis a censored observation, j=1, 2 and i=1, …, n. In this way, we rewrite the likelihood function as(12)L=∏i=1n∂2S(t1i,t2i)∂t1i∂t2iδ1iδ2i−∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t1iδ1i(1−δ2i)×−∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t2i(1−δ1i)δ2i[S(t1i,t2i)](1−δ1i)(1−δ2i),where S(t1i, t2i) is given by Eq. (10) and the partial derivatives of S(t1i, t2i) with respect to t1iand t2iare obtained respectively from the relations∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t1i=ϕ10∂S01(t1i)∂t1i+ϕ11∂S012(t1i,t2i)∂t1i,and∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t2i=ϕ01∂S10(t2i)∂t2i+ϕ11∂S012(t1i,t2i)∂t2i.In addition, we have∂2S(t1i,t2i)∂t1i∂t2i=ϕ11∂2S012(t1i,t2i)∂t1i∂t2i.The joint survival function S012(t1, t2) can be defined by a copula function given byS012(t1,t2)=Cλ(S01(t1),S02(t2)),for t1>0 and t2>0, where λ is a measure of the dependence between T1 and T2. There are many families of copula functions which differ in relation to the degree of dependence they represent [38]. In this study we consider three types of copula function models, the Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern (FGM), the Clayton and the Gumbel–Barnett (GB) copulas, as described below.(a)FGM copula: considering a FGM copula function, the joint long-term survival function for T1>0 and T2>0 is given by(13)S012(t1,t2)=S01(t1)S02(t2)[1+λF01(t1)F02(t2)],where −1≤λ≤1. In the expression (13), F0k(tk)=1−S0k(tk) is the baseline cumulative distribution function for Tk, k=1, 2. If the dependence parameter λ is equal to zero, then the joint survival function (13) takes the form S012(t1, t2)=S01(t1)S02(t2), that is, in this case T1 and T2 are independent for the susceptible individuals. The parameter λ is related to the Kendall rank correlation coefficient by the expression τ(λ)=2λ/9. We thus note that −2/9≤τ(λ)≤2/9; in this way, the FGM copula is appropriate to model weak dependences. The derivatives of S(t1i, t2i) that appear in the expression (12) are given respectively by−∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t1i=f01i(t1i){ϕ10+ϕ11S02(t2)−ϕ11λS02(t2i)F02(t2i)[1−2F01(t1i)]},−∂S(t1,t2)∂t2i=f10i(t1i){ϕ01+ϕ11S01(t1)−ϕ11λS01(t1i)F01(t1i)[1−2F02(t2i)]},and∂2S(t1,t2)∂t1∂t2=ϕ11f01(t1)f02(t2){1+λ[1−2F01(t1)][1−2F02(t2)]}.The FGM copula was first proposed by Morgenstern [39] and further studied by Gumbel [40] and Farlie [41].Clayton copula: the joint long-term survival function for T1 and T2 induced by the Clayton copula [42,43] takes the form(14)S012(t1,t2)={[S01(t1)]−λ+[S02(t2)]−λ−1}−1/λwhere λ∈(0, ∞). In this case, the marginals become independent when λ tends to zero. For this copula function, the relationship between the dependence copula parameter λ and the Kendall correlation coefficient is given by τ(λ)=λ/(λ+2). Consequently, Clayton copulas could only represent positive dependence structures. The first partial derivatives of S(t1i, t2i) that appear in the expression (12) are given respectively by−∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t1i=ϕ10f01(t1)+ϕ11f01(t1)[S01(t1)]−(λ+1)[A(t1,t2)]−(1+(1/λ)),−∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t2i=ϕ01f02(t2)+ϕ11f02(t1)[S02(t1)]−(λ+1)[A(t1,t2)]−(1+(1/λ)),and∂2S(t1,t2)∂t1∂t2=ϕ11(λ+1)f01(t1)f02(t2)[S01(t1)S02(t2)]−(λ+1)[A(t1,t2)]−(2+(1/λ)),where A(t1, t2)=[S01(t1)]−λ+[S02(t2)]−λ−1.GB copula: when considering the Gumbel–Barnett (GB) copula [40,44], the joint long-term survival function for T1 and T2 takes the form(15)S012(t1,t2)=S01(t1)S02(t2)exp{−λln[S01(t1)]ln[S02(t2)]},where λ∈(0, 1] and ln is the natural logarithm. We note that when λ takes the zero value, we have independence between the lifetime times. The GB copula covers a region of negative dependence, and the relationship between the dependence copula parameter λ and the Kendall correlation coefficient is written in terms of an exponential integral function, which must be evaluated numerically [45]. In this way,τ(λ)=e(2/λ)∫−∞−2/λettdt.In addition, we have−∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t1i=f01(t1){ϕ10+ϕ11S02(t2)B(t1,t2)[1−λln(S02(t2))]},−∂S(t1i,t2i)∂t2i=f02(t2){ϕ01+ϕ11S01(t1)B(t1,t2)[1−λln(S01(t1))]},∂2S(t1,t2)∂t1∂t2=ϕ11f01(t1)f02(t2)B(t1,t2)×{1−λ−λln[S01(t1)]−λln[S02(t2)]+λ2ln[S01(t1)]ln[S02(t2)]},where B(t1, t2)=exp{−λln[S01(t1)]ln[S02(t2)]}.Considering the proposed bivariate model, letν=(α1, θ1, β1, p1, α2, θ2, β2, p2, ω, λ) be the vector of unknown parameters. In a Bayesian framework, the joint distribution of the model parameters is obtained by combining the joint prior distribution of the parameters and the likelihood function forνgiven by Eq. (12). To simulate samples of the joint posterior distribution we could have a great computational simplification using some existing MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) algorithms implemented in the OpenBUGS software, where we only need to specify the distribution for the data and the joint prior distribution for the parameters. For a Bayesian analysis of the model, we assume independent gamma prior distributions for the parameters α1, θ1, β1, α2, θ2 and β2. Thus, we haveαk∼Gamma(aαk,bαk),θk∼Gamma(aθk,bθk)andβk∼Gamma(aβk,bβk), k=1, 2, whereaα1,bα1,aθ1,bθ1,aβ1,bβ2,aα2,bα2,aθ2,bθ2,aβ2andbβ2are known hyperparameters and Gamma(a, b) denotes a gamma distribution with mean a/b and variance a/b2. We also assume a beta prior distribution for the cure fractions p1 and p2 considering that these parameters are defined for values in the interval (0,1). Thus, we havepk∼Beta(cpk,dpk), where Beta(c, d) denotes a beta distribution andcp1,dp1,cp2anddp2are known hyperparameters. Considering that 0≤ω≤min(p1, p2)−p1p2, we assume a generalized beta [46] prior distribution for the covariance parameter ω. Thus, ω∼GB(cω, dω), where GB denotes a generalized beta distribution with known hyperparameters cωand dω. A generalized beta is a distribution with a density given by a standard beta density ranged in an interval not necessary equals to [0,1]. We also assume that the dependence parameter λ follows a uniform prior distribution (1−λ)/2∼Beta(cλ, dλ) when considering the FGM and GB copula functions. This choice assures that λ∈(−1, 1). When considering the Clayton copula function, we assume λ∼Gamma(cλ, dλ). Note that cλand dλare known hyperparameters. We also assume independence among the parameters included in the model. The joint prior distribution π(ν) is hence given by the product of the densities of the prior distributions for the parameters included in the model.Based on the Bayes theorem, the joint posterior distribution is obtained by combining the likelihood function (12) with the joint prior distribution π(ν). The joint posterior distribution is not analytically tractable, but posterior summaries of interest can be readily obtained using MCMC methods. In our applications we generated 1,010,000Gibbs samples for each parameter, where the first 10,000 simulated samples were discarded as a burn-in period, which is used to minimize the effect of the initial values. In addition, we store each 100th simulated sample to avoid autocorrelation between successive samples. The median of the simulated values for a given parameter was used as a point estimate for that parameter, since some simulated distributions were quite skewed. The 95% credible intervals were also determined for each parameter on the basis of the upper and lower 2.5% quantiles of the corresponding simulated values. Convergence was monitored by plotting trace and autocorrelation plots of the samples and also using some existing Bayesian convergence methods.Comparison between models assuming different formulations was assessed by the deviance information criteria (DIC), a measure of model fit introduced by Spiegelhalter et al. [47]. Lower values of DIC indicate better model fit. The DIC value is computed asDIC=D(νˆ)+2np=2D¯−D(νˆ), whereD(νˆ)is the deviance evaluated using the mean of the parametersνobtained from the MCMC draws,D¯is the posterior mean of the deviance andnp=D¯−D(νˆ)is the effective number of parameters of the model. We also obtained the expected Akaike information criterion (EAIC) proposed by Brooks [48] and the expected Bayesian (or Schwarz) information criterion (EBIC) introduced by Carlin and Louis [36]. EAIC and EBIC are also useful measures for model selection and can be calculated byEAIC=D¯+2qandEBIC=D¯+qln(n), respectively, where q is the number of parameters in the model and n is the sample size. All Bayesian parameter estimates, the associated 95% credible intervals and the DIC, EAIC and EBIC values were obtained using the OpenBUGS software version 3.2.2.In this subsection, we present an application of the proposed model to real medical data from a published study that included a total of 148 women diagnosed and treated for invasive cervical carcinoma between 1992 and 2002. The interested reader should consult Brenna et al. [49] for further details of this data set. In the present study, we consider a subsample of 118 women who received the standard treatment recommended by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). The disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from the date of surgery to the first event of disease recurrence and the overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of surgery to the death. Thus, let T1 and T2 be two random variables denoting the DFS and the OS times, respectively.Table 1shows that we have 48.3% of censored data if we consider the DFS time and 53.4% of censored data if we consider the OS time. We also observe that 48.3% of the data are censored in regard to both DFS and OS times. There are no patients with both censored data at the DFS time and completed data at the OS time.Firstly, we fitted univariate models separately for DFS and for OS times, considering the generalized Lindley, gamma and standard Lindley distributions, with and without the cure fraction p. These models are based on the likelihood function given by the expression (7), where the baseline probability density function f0(t) is given by (1) and the baseline survival function S0(t) is given by Eq. (2). Assuming prior independence among the parameters, consider the following prior densities for α, θ and β: α∼Gamma(1, 1), θ∼Gamma(1, 1) and β∼Gamma(1, 1). When included, the cure fraction follows a beta distribution specified by p∼Beta(1, 1). We must also remember that the model based on the gamma distribution considers β=0 and the model based on the standard Lindley distribution considers α=1 and θ=1. Posterior summaries for these univariate models considering the DFS time (T1) are shown in Table 2, and considering the OS time (T2) are shown in Table 3. A brief sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of various choices for the hyperparameters of the priors on α, θ and β, such as gamma prior distributions specified by Gamma(1, 0.1), Gamma(0.1, 0.1) and Gamma(1, 0.001), but only small changes were observed in the results. In some cases, when we considered prior distributions with larger variances for α, θ and β, even increasing the number of samples and thinning interval used in the simulation procedure to get samples of the joint posterior distributions, we could not get convergence of the chains.The results given in Tables 2 and 3 show that the models with a cure fraction have lower DIC values, suggesting that the addition of a cure fraction parameter improve the fit for the considered data. The graphs in Fig. 3show the Kaplan–Meier estimates for the survival functions considering the DFS and OS times and the survival functions obtained from the fit of the univariate models (results in Tables 2 and 3), according to the generalized Lindley distribution and its special cases. We note that the survival curves associated to the models that include the cure fraction are the closest to the empirical values obtained from Kaplan–Meier estimates.Table 4shows results for the bivariate models based on the generalized Lindley distribution and the copula functions, also including the independence copula. The independence copula is the simplest copula function and it corresponds to S012(t1, t2)=Cλ(S01(t1), S02(t2))=S01(t1)S02(t2), similar to the FGM copula when λ=0. Table 4 also exhibits Bayesian estimates for the dependence parameter λ considering the FGM, Clayton and GB copulas, but it is important to observe that λ has different interpretations depending on the copula function and thus it is not comparable between the models based on different copulas. When comparing the models, Table 4 shows that the models that assume dependence between the indicator random variables V1 and V2 of susceptible individuals have lower DIC values, suggesting that the addition of the parameter ω improves the fit for the data. We also observe that the estimates for the parameters ϕ00, ϕ01, ϕ10 and ϕ11 are quite different if we compare the models that include and do not include the dependence between the indicator random variables V1 and V2. Considering independence between the cure fractions, the Bayesian estimates for ϕ00, ϕ01, ϕ10 and ϕ11 are close to 13%, 24%, 22% and 41%, respectively. However, when including the parameter ω in the models, the estimates for ϕ00, ϕ01, ϕ10 and ϕ11 are close to 39%, 3%, 0.7% and 56%, respectively. These results may appear more clinically plausible considering the frequencies in Table 1, although censored data do not necessarily correspond to cure fractions. However, this argument reinforces that the models that include the covariance parameter ω are more suitable to the data compared to other specifications.In addition to these points, we also note in Table 4 that the models based on the Clayton copula are the models with the lowest DIC values. It is important to point out that FGM copulas can only model relatively weak positive dependence [23], while Clayton copulas exhibits strong left tail dependence and relatively weak right tail dependence [50]. Gumbel–Barnett copulas are suitable to represent situations with weak and negative dependence. However, negative dependence is not a usual characteristic of survival times. Perhaps for these reasons, in the present study the model based on the Clayton copula is the most suitable to the data set.In the plots in Fig. 4we compared the survival functions for the DFS and OS times estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and the survival curves obtained from the bivariate models based on the generalized Lindley distribution (results in Table 4). We can note in Table 4 that the Bayesian estimates for α1, θ1 and β1 are quite similar when compared between the models based on the different copula functions. Consequently, in the graphs (a) and (c) in Fig. 4, the survival curves based on the different copula functions are relatively close. We observe in Table 4 that the Bayesian estimates for α2, θ2 and β2 showed a greater variability among the considered copula functions.In this subsection we consider the copula-based Bayesian approach presented in the previous sections in the estimation of parameters of interest for the data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study [15], where the objective was to assess the efficacy of photocoagulation treatment for proliferative retinopathy. The main endpoint of this study is severe visual loss in each eye. Thus, let T1 and T2 be two random variables denoting the time up to visual loss for the control eye and the time up to visual loss for the treatment eye, respectively.In the Bayesian analysis, the choice of the prior distributions was similar to that of the previous application. Table 5shows results for the bivariate models based on the generalized Lindley distribution and the different copula functions. As in the previous application example, Table 5 shows that the models that assume dependence between the indicator random variables V1 and V2 of susceptible individuals have lower DIC values, except for the Clayton copula, where the DIC value does not change. This suggests that the addition of the parameter ω improves the fit for the data. In the plots in Fig. 5we compared the survival functions for the T1 and T2 times estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and the survival curves obtained from the bivariate models based on the generalized Lindley distribution (results in Table 5). We can note that the estimated survival curves considering the independence and GB copula are very close to each other, almost overlapping in the graphs.
