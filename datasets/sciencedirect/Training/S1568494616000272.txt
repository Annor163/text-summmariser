@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we focus on finding high quality solutions for the problem of maximum partitioning of graphs with supply and demand (MPGSD). There is a growing interest for the MPGSD due to its close connection to problems appearing in the field of electrical distribution systems, especially for the optimization of self-adequacy of interconnected microgrids. We propose an ant colony optimization algorithm for the problem. With the goal of further improving the algorithm we combine it with a previously developed correction procedure. In our computational experiments we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on trees, 3-connected graphs, series–parallel graphs and general graphs. The tests show that the method manages to find optimal solutions for more than 50% of the problem instances, and has an average relative error of less than 0.5% when compared to known optimal solutions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In recent years the research in the field of smart grids has had a significant increase in exploring the concept of interconnected microgrids [1]. The main reason for this shift is the increasing participation of Distributed Energy Resources (DER), like wind turbines, solar panels, etc. In practice a microgrid consist of a cluster of DERs and loads which can be, to a certain extent, controlled autonomously form the rest of the grid. It has been shown that by the use of microgrids, Photovoltaics (PV) systems can be effectively included into an existing infrastructure [1]. One of the main advantages of this approach is the lowering of the interaction between the local production and the national electric grid, utilizing only a limited number of connection points. This approach brings significant advantages to the users inside of the microgrid, such as the increased reliability and the independence of the main grid.This approach has resulted in novel types of typologies for electrical grids and new aspects of such systems that should be considered. Some of the most prominent newly emerged problems are the maximization of self-adequacy [2], reliability, supply-security [3] and the potential for self-healing [4] of such systems. In many cases the underlying optimization problems are of a very high complexity and cannot be solved to proven optimality in polynomial time. Electrical grids are systems of gigantic size, which makes their optimization very hard from a computational point of view. Luckily, previous research has shown that for many systems it is not necessary to use highly detailed models; often simplified graph models can give sufficiently good approximations to the original problem. The family of graph partitioning problems has proven to be closely related to power supply and delivery networks [5–9].In a system of interconnected microgrids each microgrid is made as independent from the rest of the system as possible; this results in many positive characteristics. Some examples are the lower complexity of the entire grid and enhanced reliability of each of the microgrids due to the increased resistance to failures in other parts of the system. The term independent is used for the case when there is a minimum of power exchange between the connected microgrids. This property of the system is formally defined as the maximization of self-adequacy of interconnected microgrids. Recently, research has been conducted in developing algorithms for finding approximate solutions [2] to this problem. Previous research has also explored the closely related problem of efficient decomposition or islanding of large grids into islands with a balanced generation/load subject to specific constraints [10,11]. Due to the large complexity and size of electrical grids, when attempting to model and optimize some global properties, it is frequently convenient to use simplified graph models. Such models often result in different versions of graph partitioning problems suitable for specific real life applications. Some examples are having a balanced partitioning [12], minimizing the number or weight of cuts [13,14], or by limiting the number of cuts [15].The focus of this paper is on the Maximal Partitioning of Graphs with Supply and Demand (MPGSD). The majority of previous research has been dedicated to the theoretical aspects of this problem [16,17,6,18]. A significant part of the published work is focused on solving this problem for specific types of graphs like trees [17,6,18] and series–parallel graphs [16]. A method for finding solutions with a guarantee of a 2k-approximation for general graphs has been presented in [9]. Different variations of the original problem have been developed, like a parametric version [19] and one with additional capacity constraints [20].In this paper we present an ant colony optimization (ACO) [21] approach for finding high quality approximate solutions to the MPGSD. ACO has previously been successfully applied to problems of multiway [22] and balanced [23] graph partitioning. The same method has also proven to be suitable for the closely related problems of graph cutting [24] and covering [25,26] and partitioning of meshes [27]. The proposed ACO adaptation for our problem of interest is based on the greedy algorithm presented in [28,29]. The ACO algorithm is further improved by combining it with our previously developed correction procedure [29]. In our tests on trees, 3-connected graphs, series–parallel graphs and general graphs, we show that the newly developed method frequently manages to find optimal solutions and has a small average error when compared to known optimal solutions.The paper is organized as follows. In the second section we give the definition of the MPGSD followed by a section discussing related work. Then we provide a short outline of a greedy algorithm which is used as a basis for the proposed method. Section 5 describes a GRASP algorithm for reasons of comparison. In the sixth section we present details of our ACO algorithm. In the subsequent sections we discuss results of our computational experiments and provide some conclusions.The MPGSD is defined for an undirected graph G=(V, E) with a set of nodes V and a set of edges E. The set of nodes V is split into two disjunct subsets Vsand Vd. Each node u∈Vswill be called a supply vertex and will have a corresponding positive integer value sup(u). Elements of the second subsetv∈Vdwill be called demand vertices and will have a corresponding positive integer valuedem(v). The goal is to find a partitioning Π={S1, S2, …, Sn} of the graph G that satisfies the following constraints. All the subgraphs in Π must be connected subgraphs containing only a single distinct supply node. As a result we have |Vs|=n. Each of the Simust have a supply greater or equal to its total demand. Each demand vertex can be an element of only one subgraph, or in other words it can only receive 'power’ from one supply vertex through the edges of G. For simplicity of notation let as assume that the nodeviis the supply node of subgraph Si.The goal is to maximize the fulfillment of demands, or more precisely to maximize the following sum.(1)D(Π)=∑S∈Π∑v∈S∩Vddem(v)while the following constraints are satisfied for all Si∈Π(2)∑v∈Si∩Vddem(v)≤sup(vi)(3)Si∩Sj=∅,i≠j(4)SiisconnectedAn illustration of the MPGSD is given in Fig. 1.It has been shown that the MPGSD is NP-hard even in the case of a graph containing only one supply node and having a star structure [16].
