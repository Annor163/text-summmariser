@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Personnel selection is a critical enterprise strategic problem in knowledge-intensive enterprise. Fuzzy number which can be described as triangular (trapezoid) fuzzy number is an adequate way to assess the evaluation and weights for the alternatives. In that case, fuzzy TOPSIS, as a classic fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, has been applied in personnel selection problems. Currently, all the researches on this topic either apply crisp relative closeness but causing information loss, or employ fuzzy relative closeness estimate but with complicated computation to rank the alternatives. In this paper, based on Karnik–Mendel (KM) algorithm, we propose an analytical solution to fuzzy TOPSIS method. Some properties are discussed, and the computation procedure for the proposed analytical solution is given as well. Compared with the existing TOPSIS method for personnel selection problem, it obtains accurate fuzzy relative closeness instead of the crisp point or approximate fuzzy relative closeness estimate. It can both avoid information loss and keep computational efficiency in some extent. Moreover, the global picture of fuzzy relative closeness provides a way to further discuss the inner properties of fuzzy TOPSIS method. Detailed comparisons with approximate fuzzy relative closeness method are provided in personnel selection application.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Human resources are one of the most critical elements for knowledge-intensive enterprises to enhance their competitive strength in knowledge economy environment [25,27]. And personnel recruitment and selection directly determines the input quality of human resource [2,10]. With the variety of candidates that exist in human resource market, the employer must know which candidate matches the qualifications required to perform the defined job in the best way [12,20]. To solve this problem, more attention have been payed to the selection of eligible and adequate person among alternatives [13,26,40]. However, the factors with respect to knowledge-intensive employees are difficult to express as crisp numbers, such as technology skill, work experience, personality and oral communication skill. The fuzzy set theory proposed by Zadeh [50] and the concept of fuzzy numbers introduced by Dubois and Prade [9] can be applied to improve the evaluation and weights for these factors in personnel selection problems [8,14,17,18,28,30]. Liang and Wang [25] introduced a fuzzy decision making method to combine subjective assessments with objectives tests. Yaakob and Kawata [49] also used a fuzzy decision making method to deal with workers’ placement problem.The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) [15] is a classic decision making method, which is based on the idea that the best alternative should have the shortest distance from a positive ideal solution and the farthest distance from a negative ideal solution. In traditional TOPSIS method, the weights of the criteria and the ratings of alternatives are defined as crisp numbers. Fuzzy number which can be described as triangular (trapezoid) fuzzy number is an adequate way to deal with the imprecision or vagueness nature of the subjective assessments. Under this condition, Jahanshahloo et al. [16] extended the TOPSIS method to triangular fuzzy numbers environment. Wang and Lee [45] generalized the TOPSIS method with max and min operations in a fuzzy environment. Mokhtarian and Vencheh [38] revised fuzzy TOPSIS method based on the left and right scores. Peng et al. [22,39] developed fuzzy TOPSIS approach to evaluate classification algorithms for financial risk prediction. Behzadian et al. [3] conducted a state-of-the-art literature survey on TOPSIS applications and methodologies. Dymova [11] extended fuzzy TOPSIS method which is free of the limitations of other known approaches. Triantaphyllou and Lin [43] developed the fuzzy TOPSIS method based on fuzzy arithmetic operations, which leads a fuzzy relative closeness. Apart from the triangular (trapezoid) fuzzy environment, Chen and Tsao [7] and Ashtiani et al. [1] developed the TOPSIS method to interval-valued fuzzy numbers environment. Boran et al. [4] proposed an intuitionistic based TOPSIS method for MCDM problem. Wei [46,47] developed two fuzzy linguistic MCDM methods based on the idea of TOPSIS method. Chen and Lee [6] presented an interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method to hire a system analyst.For the application of TOPSIS method in personnel selection field, Chen [5] extended TOPSIS method to fuzzy environment for personal selection. Shih et al. [42] proposed an integrated group TOPSIS method procedure for solving personnel selection. Mahdavi et al. [35] designed a fuzzy TOPSIS model with the appropriate negations for system analyst selection. Saremi et al. [41] modified TOPSIS approach with geometric mean to select total quality management consultant. Kelemenis and Askounis [20] developed TOPSIS approach which incorporates the veto threshold for the ranking of the candidates. Dursun and Karsak [10] extended TOPSIS method to both linguistic and numerical assessment scales in personnel selection. Kelemenis et al. [21] combined TOPSIS method with fuzzy logic to solve support managers’ selection problem. Wang and Elhag [44] developed a fuzzy TOPSIS method based on α-cut sets to solve personnel selection problem, which obtains approximate fuzzy relative closeness for the alternative.From the analysis of the researches above, it is observed that except for Triantaphyllou and Lin's [43] and Wang and Elhag's [44] TOPSIS methods, all the others mentioned above obtain a crisp relative closeness for the alternative. They defuzzify the imprecise values at the beginning of the computing process, which will bring information loss. Although Triantaphyllou and Lin's TOPSIS method and Wang and Elhag's TOPSIS method provide a fuzzy relative closeness for the alternative, the closeness obtained by Triantaphyllou and Lin's method is badly distorted or over exaggerated because of the fuzzy arithmetic operations. The closeness computed by Wang and Elhag's method is an approximate fuzzy estimate, but the accuracy is largely depended on the α-cut granularity, and the computation of each α-cut is repetitive. Hence, it is necessary to develop an exact fuzzy TOPSIS method to solve MCDM problems. Motivated by such a need, we develop an exact analytical solution to fuzzy TOPSIS model based on KM algorithm [19,48]. KM algorithm is originally used for computing the centroid of interval type-2 fuzzy set [19]. It transforms the fractional NLP problems into identifying the switch points of α levels, which is monotonically and superexponentially convergent to the optimal solution [37]. In view of the characteristic of KM algorithm, the advantage of the proposed analytical solution to fuzzy TOPSIS method can be summarized as follows. Firstly, it is computationally efficient, as the KM algorithm transforms the fractional nonlinear programming (NLP) problem into identifying the switch points of α level, and the computation can be merged into once when some α-cut intervals have the same switch point. Secondly, it is accurate, as all the switch points are identified through analytical function of fuzzy TOPSIS, not artificial α-cut level sets in discrete format. Thirdly, the analytical expression presents a global picture of fuzzy relative closeness, which provides the possibility for further discussing the inner properties of the fuzzy TOPSIS method.This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the fuzzy TOPSIS method based on α-cut and the principle of KM algorithm. Section 3 proposes an analytical solution to fuzzy TOPSIS method, and discusses some properties of it. Section 4 illustrates an application of personnel selection in a software enterprise, and compares the results with that of α-cut method. Section 5 summarizes the main results and draws conclusions.In this section, we introduce the computation procedure of fuzzy TOPSIS with α-cut sets and the principle of KM algorithm.A fuzzy number is a convex fuzzy set, which is characterized by an interval [0, 1]. Take the triangular fuzzy numberA˜=(a,b,d)as an example, whose membership functions are defined as follows.μA˜(x)=(x−a)/(b−a),x∈[a,b],(d−x)/(d−b),x∈[b,d],0,otherwise.According to Zadeh's extension principle [50], the fuzzy setA˜can be denoted by its intervals as:A˜=⋃αα·Aα,α∈[0,1],where Aαis a α-cut set of fuzzy numberA˜, andAα={x˜∈X˜∣μA˜(x˜)≥α},=[min{x˜∈X˜∣μA˜(x˜)≥α},max{x˜∈X˜∣μA˜(x˜)≥α}],=[AαL,AαU].Suppose a fuzzy MCDM problem has m alternatives and n decision criteria, which can be expressed in matrix format as:where A1−mare alternatives, C1−nare evaluation criteria,x˜jiis the performance rating of Ajfor criteria Ci,wiis the weight for criteria Ci.Ifx˜ji=(aji,bji,dji)(i=1,2,…,n;j=1,2,…,m)are triangular fuzzy numbers, the fuzzy TOPSIS method based on α-cut sets [44] can be summarized as follows.(1)Normalize fuzzy decision matrixX˜=(x˜ji)m×nusing the equations below:x˜ji=ajidi*,bjidi*,djidi*,j=1,2,…,m,i∈Ωb,x˜ji=ai−dji,ai−bji,ai−aji,j=1,2,…,m,i∈Ωd,wheredi*=maxjdji,i∈Ωb,ai−=minjaji,i∈Ωd.Calculate each α-cut sets ofx˜ji(i=1,2,…,n;j=1,2,…,m).Compute the fuzzy relative closeness of each alternative by solving the NLP models for each α-cut level as:(1)RCj=∑i=1n(wixji)2∑i=1n(wixji)2+∑i=1n(wi(xji−1))2s.t.(wiL)α≤wi≤(wiU)α,i=1,2,…,n.(xjiL)α≤xji≤(xjiU)α,j=1,2,…,m.As RCjis a triangular fuzzy number, the lower and upper limits can be obtained by the following fractional NLP models:(2)(RCjL)α=min∑i=1n(wi(xjiL)α)2∑i=1n(wi(xjiL)α)2+∑i=1n(wi((xjiL)α)−1)2s.t.(wiL)α≤wi≤(wiU)α,i=1,2,…,n.(3)(RCjU)α=max∑i=1n(wi(xjiU)α)2∑i=1n(wi(xjiU)α)2+∑i=1n(wi((xjiU)α)−1)2s.t.(wiL)α≤wi≤(wiU)α,i=1,2,…,n.where(xji)α=[(xjiL)α,(xjiU)α]and(wi)α=[(wiL)α,(wiU)α]are the α-cut sets of xjiandwi.And(4)RCj=⋃α[(RCjL)α,(RCjU)α],α∈[0,1].Defuzzify the fuzzy relative closeness by computing the average level cuts as:(5)RCj*=1N∑i=1n(RCjL)α+(RCjU)α2,i=1,2,…,n.Rank the alternatives in terms of their defuzzified relative closenesses. The biggerRCj*is, the better alternative Aj.KM algorithm [19] is a type reduction method in IT2 FSs, which was originally used to compute the centroid of IT2 FSs. The principle can be described as follows.Definition 1[37]For an interval type-2 fuzzy setA˜, the centroidcA˜=[cl,cr]can be defined as the maximum and minimum solutions to the following interval fractional programming, respectively:(6)y(θ1,θ2,…,θn)≜∑i=1nxiθi∑i=1nθi,where xis are increasing in the domain X, and θican be changed between the lower membership function (LMF)μ_A˜(xi)and upper membership function (UMF)μ¯A˜(xi).The derivative of function y(θ1, θ2, …, θn) with variable θk(k=1, 2, …, n) is denoted as:(7)∂y(θ1,θ2,…,θn)∂θk=∂∂θk∑i=1nxiθi∑i=1nθi=xk−y(θ1,θ2,…,θn)∑i=1nθi.In Eq. (7), because of∑i=1nθi>0, it is concluded that xkis the switch point, which determines the monotonicity of function y(θ1, θ2, …, θn). That is if(8)xk≥y(θ1,θ2,…,θn),y(θ1,θ2,…,θn)monotonically increases withxk;xk<y(θ1,θ2,…,θn),y(θ1,θ2,…,θn)monotonically decreases withxk.According to Eq. (8), suppose the maximum (minimum) of θkisμ¯A˜(xi)(μ_A˜(xi)), it is implied that y(θ1, θ2, …, θn) reaches the minimum, i.e. yL, if(1) for those values of k, it follows xk<y(θ1, θ2, …, θn), such thatθk=μ¯A˜(xi); (2) for those values of k, it follows xk>y(θ1, θ2, …, θn), such thatθk=μ_A˜(xi). Similarly, it can easily be deduced that y(θ1, θ2, …, θn) reaches the maximum, i.e. yU, if (1) for those values of k, it follows xk>y(θ1, θ2, …, θn), such thatθk=μ¯A˜(xi); (2) for those values of k, it follows xk<y(θ1, θ2, …, θn), such thatθk=μ_A˜(xi). Combined with the conclusions together, it is easy to verify that yLor yUswitch only once betweenμ¯A˜(xi)andμ_A˜(xi).Combining these facts altogether, The centroid of IT2 FSA˜,cA˜=[cl,cr], can be computed as(9)cl=∑i=1klxiμ¯A˜(xi)+∑i=kl+1Nxiμ_A˜(xi)∑i=1klμ¯A˜(xi)+∑i=kl+1Nμ_A˜(xi),(10)cr=∑i=1krxiμ_A˜(xi)+∑i=kr+1Nxiμ¯A˜(xi)∑i=1krμ¯A˜(xi)+∑i=kr+1Nμ_A˜(xi).where kland krare called “switch points” withxkl≤cl≤xkl+1andxkr≤cr≤xkr+1. The determination of kland krcan be performed by using the KM algorithm. There are many applications on KM algorithm, interested readers can refer to literatures [23,24,29,31–34,36].In this section, based on KM algorithm, we propose the fractional NLP models for fuzzy TOPSIS, and use the analytical expression to realize the computing process.KM algorithm is the basis of the proposed method to solve the fuzzy TOPSIS in an analytical way. To simplify the computing process, we use an indirect function to prove the fuzzy relative closeness expression satisfying the prerequisites of KM algorithm, which can be defined as follows.Theorem 1For fuzzy TOPSIS method,RC˜(x˜)is the relative distance of problem(1),x˜is the fuzzy variable, xLand xUis its left limit and right limit, respectively. Let(11)f˜(x˜)=∑i=1nwi(x˜i−1)2∑i=1n(wix˜i)2,s.t.wiL≤wi≤wiU,i=1,2,…,n.xjiL≤xji≤xjiU,j=1,2,…,m.ifx˜=xLand reaches at the minimum (maximum) point, then fL(xL) and RCL(xL) will obtain the maximum (minimum) and minimum (maximum) values correspondingly; otherwise, ifx˜=xUand reaches at the minimum (maximum) point, then fU(xU) and RCU(xU) will get the maximum (minimum) and minimum (maximum) values in correspondence.ProofSee Appendix A.With the conclusions of Theorem 1, we can get the limit values ofRC˜(x˜)by computing those of functionf˜(x˜). In the following, we will obtain the analytical solution to fuzzy TOPSIS method through computing the functionf˜(x˜)in an indirect way.Hence, the solutions to problems (2) and (3) can be changed into solving problems (12) and (13) indirectly.(12)fL(x)=minwi∈[wiL(α),wiU(α)]∑i=1nwi(xiL(α)−1)2∑i=1n(wixiL(α))2,s.t.wiL(α)≤wi≤wiU(α),i=1,2,…,n.(13)fU(x)=maxwi∈[wiL(α),wiU(α)]∑i=1nwi(xiU(α)−1)2∑i=1n(wixiU(α))2,s.t.wiL(α)≤wi≤wiU(α),i=1,2,…,n.To calculate the left limit fL(x) and right limit fU(x), let us rewrite Eq. (11) into the relation betweenf(wi)andwi, and getf(w1,w2,…,wn)=∑i=1n(wi(x˜i−1))2∑i=1n(wix˜i)2.The derivative of functionf(w1,w2,…,wn)with variablewk(k=1,2,…,n)is expressed as:(14)∂f(w1,w2,…,wn)∂wk=2wk(xk−1)2−2wkxk2f(w1,w2,…,wn)∑i=1n(wixi)2.From Eq. (14), it is obvious that(15)∂f(w1,w2,…,wn)∂wi≥0,if(xk−1)2xk2≥f(w1,w2,…,wn),<0,if(xk−1)2xk2<f(w1,w2,…,wn).Hence, it is obvious that Eq. (15) determines the direction where(xk−1)2/xk2to increase or decreasef(w1,w2,…,wn). If(16)(xk−1)2xk2≥f(w1,w2,…,wn),f(w1,w2,…,wn)monotonically increase with(xk−1)2xk2;(xk−1)2xk2<f(w1,w2,…,wn),f(w1,w2,…,wn)monotonically decreases with(xk−1)2xk2.Recall [see problems (12) and (13)] that the left limit thatwkcan reach isw_k, the right limit thatwkcan reach isw¯k. In Eq. (16), it is right thatf(w1,w2,…,wn)arrives its left limit fL, if(17)wk=w¯k,∀k∃(xk−1)2xk2>f(w1,w2,…,wn)w_k,∀k∃(xk−1)2xk2<f(w1,w2,…,wn)In Eq. (16), it can also be seen thatf(w1,w2,…,wn)arrives its right limit fU, if(18)wk=w¯k,∀k∃(xk−1)2xk2<f(w1,w2,…,wn)w_k,∀k∃(xk−1)2xk2>f(w1,w2,…,wn)Hence, if we want to compute fL(fU),wkswitches only once betweenwkU(α)andwkL(α). And the computation of the left limit (right limit) off(w1,w2,…,wn)is converted to solve the right limit (left limit) ofwi=wkU(α)(wi=wkL(α)), respectively.With KM algorithm, the solution to f(α) is reduced to finding the switch points of kL(α) and kU(α).Coupled with Eqs. (17) and (18), problems (12) and (13) can be rewritten as:(19)fL(α,k)=minwi∈[wiL(α),wiU(α)]∑i=1n(wi(riL(α)−1))2∑i=1n(wiriL(α))2=∑i=1kL(wiU(α)(riL(α)−1))2+∑i=kL+1nwiL(α)(riL(α)−1))2∑i=1kL(wiU(α)riL(α))2+∑i=kL+1n(wiL(α)riL(α))2,(20)fU(α,k)=maxwi∈[wiL(α),wiU(α)]∑i=1n(wi(riU(α)−1))2∑i=1n(wiriU(α))2=∑i=1kU(wiL(α)(riU(α)−1))2+∑i=kU+1n(wiU(α)(riU(α)−1))2∑i=1kU(wiL(α)riU(α))2+∑i=kU+1n(wiU(α)riU(α))2,whereriL(α)is the ith smallest element ofxiL(α),riU(α)is the ith smallest element ofxiU(α), kL=kL(α) and kU=kU(α). Both of kLand kUare the switch points such thatrkLL(α)≤fL(α)≤rkL+1L(α),rkUU(α)≤fU(α)≤rkU+1U(α).So, the values k=kLand k=kUin Eqs. (19) and (20) become the optimal solutions to Eqs. (21) and (22) as follows.(21)fL(α)=mink=0,1,…,n−1f(α,k),(22)fU(α)=maxk=0,1,…,n−1f(α,k).From Theorem 1, k=kLand k=kUin Eqs. (21) and (22) are also the optimal solutions to Eqs. (23) and (24).(23)RCL(α)=11+fL(α,k)=mink=0,1,…,n−1RC(α,k),(24)RCU(α)=11+fU(α,k)=maxk=0,1,…,n−1RC(α,k)Next, we give solutions to find the switch points of kLand kUin Eqs. (19) and (20), which are the basis for our analytical solution for fuzzy TOPSIS method.For simplification, we denoteriL(α),riU(α),wiL(α)andwiU(α)asri_,ri¯,wi_andwi¯, respectively.Similarly, Eqs. (19) and (20) can also be rewritten as follows.(25)fL=∑i=1kL(w¯i(r_i−1))2+∑i=kL+1n(w_i(r_i−1))2∑i=1kL(w¯ir_i)2+∑i=kL+1n(w_ir_i)2,(26)fU=∑i=1kU(w_i(r¯i−1))2+∑i=kU+1n(w¯i(r¯i−1))2∑i=1kU(w_ir¯i)2+∑i=kU+1n(w¯ir¯i)2.Provided that k is the variable of the evaluations (weights) index, Eqs. (25) and (26) can also be formulated as:(27)φ(k)=∑i=1k(w¯i(r_i−1))2+∑i=k+1n(w_i(r_i−1))2∑i=1k(w¯ir_i)2+∑i=k+1n(w_ir_i)2,(28)ψ(k)=∑i=1k(w_i(r¯i−1))2+∑i=k+1n(w¯i(r¯i−1))2∑i=1k(w_ir¯i)2+∑i=k+1n(w¯ir¯i)2.Correspondingly, the optimal solutions to Eqs. (12) and (13) can be rewritten as:(29)fL=mink=0,1,…,n−1φ(k),(30)fU=maxk=0,1,…,n−1ψ(k).Accordingly, the optimal solutions to Eqs. (2) and (3) can be expressed as:(31)RCL=mink=0,1,…,n−111+φ(k)=mink=0,1,…,n−1RC(k),(32)RCU=maxk=0,1,…,n−111+ψ(k)=maxk=0,1,…,n−1RC(k).Next, we will introduce the new functions named difference functions, which is used to compute the optimal switch points for Eqs. (19) and (20).Theorem 2The optimal solution to Eqs.(19) and (20)with k=kLand k=kUcan be determined as follows.(1)Let(33)dl(α,k)=∑i=1kL(rk+1L(α)−riL(α))(2rk+1L(α)riL(α)−rk+1L(α)−riL(α))(wiU(α))2+∑i=kL+2n(rk+1L(α)−riL(α))(2rk+1L(α)riL(α)−rk+1L(α)−riL(α))(wiL(α))2,dl(α, k) is a decreasing function with respect to k(k=0, 1, …, n−1), and there exists k=kL(kL=1, 2, …, n−1), such that dl(α, kL−1)≥0 and dl(α, kL)<0. So, kLis the optimal solution to Eq.(21). Moreover, when k=0, 1, …, kL, f(α, k) is a increasing function concerning k, and when k=kL, kL+1, …, n, f(α, k) is an decreasing function with respect to k. So, kLis the global maximum solution to Eq.(21)with fL(α)=f(α, kL), and the global minimum solution to Eq.(23)with RCL(α)=RC(α, kL).Let(34)du(α,k)=−∑i=1kU(rk+1U(α)−riU(α))(2rk+1U(α)riU(α)−rk+1U(α)−riU(α))(wiL(α))2−∑i=kU+2n(rk+1U(α)−riU(α))(2rk+1U(α)riU(α)−rk+1U(α)−riU(α))(wiU(α))2,du(α, k) is an increasing function with respect to k(k=0, 1, …, n−1), and there exists a value of k=kU(kU=1, 2, …, n−1), such that du(α, kU−1≤0) and du(α, kU>0). Hence, kUis the optimal solution to Eq.(22). Moreover, when k=0, 1, …, kU, f(α, k) is a decreasing function of k, and when k=kU, kU+1, …, n, f(α, k) is an increasing function of k. So, kUis the global minimum solution to Eq.(22)with fU(α)=f(α, kU), and the global maximum solution to Eq.(24)with RCU(α)=RC(α, kU).ProofSee Appendix B.From the proof of Theorem 2, it can be seen that dl(α, k) and du(α, k) in Eqs. (33) and (34) are the difference functions of fL(α, k) and fU(α, k) in Eqs. (19) and (20), through which the optimal switch point kLand kUcan be obtained.Combined the conclusions of Theorem 1 with Theorem 2, the procedure of the analytical solution to fuzzy TOPSIS method with parameter α can be denoted in Table 1.Compared with the Wang and Elhag's TOPSIS method [44], the advantages of the proposed method can be summarized as follows.(1)KM algorithm transfers the NLP models of fuzzy relative closeness into obtaining the maximum and minimum value through the switch point, with which the computing converges in so few iterations.It is computationally efficient. The proposed method just needs to compute the switch point, and the amount of which is usually smaller than ten. Whereas, the original result is obtained by connecting these α-cut level results. For example, if the α level is 100 cut sets, he or she has to compute the NLP problem 200 times.It is accurate. The fuzzy relative closeness is obtained by computing the analytical expression, and the switch point is also the accurate value, with which the alternatives can be discriminated clearly. But the original method gives an approximate fuzzy result by connecting these α-cut level values, which makes the results’ accuracy largely dependent on the division granularity of α interval [0, 1]. For example, if one wants to keep the absolute error bounds within 0.001, he or she has to collect at least 1000 discrete α-cut points.The analytical expression presents a global picture of fuzzy relative closeness for fuzzy TOPSIS method, which provides a way to further analyze the inner properties of the fuzzy TOPSIS method.We use the example proposed by Chen [5] to examine the precision of the analytical method. Suppose a software enterprise wants to hire a system analyst engineer from three candidates A1−3. There are three decision makers (D1−3) to interview the three candidates, and the assessment criteria to be conducted are: emotional steadiness (C1), oral communication skill (C2), personality (C3), past experience (C4) and self-confidence (C5). The evaluation of the criteria are defined in Table 2.The relative weights of the five criteria by those three decision makers are shown in Table 3. The average weight is computed by the expression:w¯i=(w˜i1+w˜i2+w˜i3)/3, andw¯ikis the weight of the ith criteria given by the kth(k=1, 2, 3) decision maker.The evaluations of the three candidates concerning the five criteria by three decision makers are listed in Table 4. The average fuzzy number is computed by the expression:x¯ji=(x˜ji1+x˜ji2+x˜ji3)/3, andx˜jikis the evaluation given to the jth candidate under the ith criteria by the kth (k=1, 2, 3) decision maker.As far as the example is concerned, due to the fact that the computation of fuzzy relative closeness for candidate A3 is a bit complicated, we prefer to firstly compute the result for candidate A3 in detail. Next, we will show the process of computing fuzzy relative closeness for the candidates in an analytical way.(1)Compute the minimum fuzzy relative closenessRC˜Lfor candidate A3.Step 1: Normalize the fuzzy decision matrix and its positive (negative) ideal solution, which are shown in Table 5.Step 2: Write the average fuzzy evaluations and the average fuzzy weights with parameter α for candidate A3.The average fuzzy evaluations and average fuzzy weights with α level can be denoted as:x˜1(α)=[x1L(α),x1U(α)]=(0.66+0.16α,0.93−0.11α),x˜2(α)=[x2L(α),x2U(α)]=(0.7+0.17α,0.97−0.1α),x˜3(α)=[x3L(α),x3U(α)]=(0.7+0.17α,0.97−0.1α),x˜4(α)=[x4L(α),x4U(α)]=(0.7+0.17α,0.97−0.1α),x˜5(α)=[x5L(α),x5U(α)]=(0.66+0.2α,1−0.14α),w˜1(α)=[w1L(α),w1U(α)]=(0.7+0.17α,0.97−0.1α),w˜2(α)=[w2L(α),w2U(α)]=(0.9+0.1α,1),w˜3(α)=[w3L(α),w3U(α)]=(0.77+0.16α,1−0.07α),w˜4(α)=[w4L(α),w4U(α)]=(0.9+0.1α,1),w˜5(α)=[w5L(α),w5U(α)]=(0.43+0.2α,0.83−0.2α).Step 3: Order the fuzzy evaluation setxiL.As for ∀α∈[0, 1],x1L(α)≤x5L(α)≤x2L(α)=x3L(α)=x4L(α), which are listed in Fig. 1. LetriL(α)be the fuzzy evaluation setxiL(α)in increasing order, which is denoted byr_ifor short. Then,r_1=x1L(α),r_2=x5L(α),r_3=x2L(α),r_4=x3L(α)andr_5=x4L(α).Step 4: Match the weightswiwith fuzzy evaluation set xi.Step 5: Construct the left difference functions dl(α, k)(k=0, 1, …, 4) for candidate A3.According to Eq.

(19), when α∈[0, 0.98], the closed-form solution to fL(α) can be expressed as:(35)fL(α)=∑j=12(w¯j(r_j−1))2+∑j=35(w_j(r_j−1))2∑j=12(w¯jr_j)2+∑j=35(w_jr_j)2=0.277+0.004α4+0.017α3−0.015α2−0.202α1.378+0.004α4+0.058α3+0.376α2+1.155α.When α∈[0.98, 1], the closed-form solution for function fL(α) can be written as:(36)fL(α)=∑j=11(w¯j(r_j−1))2+∑j=25(w_j(r_j−1))2∑j=11(w¯jr_j)2+∑j=25(w_jr_j)2=0.329+0.003α4+0.008α3+0.041α2−0.301α1.575+0.003α4+0.043α3+0.288α2+1.062α.Step 8: Write the closed-form fuzzy relative closenessRC3L(α).Combined with Eqs. (35) and (36) together, for ∀α∈[0, 1], the closed-form fuzzy relative closenessRC3L(α)is denoted as:(37)RC3L(α)=11+(0.277+0.004α4+0.017α3−0.015α2−0.202α)/(1.378+0.004α4+0.058α3+0.376α2+1.155α),0≤α≤0.98,11+(0.329+0.003α4+0.008α3+0.041α2−0.301α)/(1.575+0.003α4+0.043α3+0.288α2+1.062α),0.98≤α≤1.Compute the maximum fuzzy relative closenessRC˜3Ufor candidate A3.Steps 1–3: Order the fuzzy setxiU.As there exists an intersection betweenx1U(α)andx2U(α)(x3U(α)/x4U(α))at point (0.75, 0.9), which is shown in Fig. 3. We divide the range ofxiUinto two parts to compute the maximum relative closeness for candidate A3, that is α∈[0, 0.75] and α∈[0.75, 1].Steps 4–8: When α∈[0, 0.75], the closed-form fuzzy relative closeness denoted asRC3U(α)for candidate A3 is:(38)RC3U(α)=11+(0.005+0.001α4−0.005α3+0.052α2+0.027α)/(3.935+0.001α4−0.023α3+0.19α2−1.133α),α∈[0,0.75].Step 9: When α∈[0.75, 1], the closed-form fuzzy relative closeness denoted asRC3U(α)for candidate A3 is:(39)RC3U(α)=11+(0.005+0.001α4−0.005α3+0.052α2+0.027α)/(3.935+0.001α4−0.023α3+0.19α2−1.133α),α∈[0.75,1].Fortunately, both intervals have the same expression of the closed-form fuzzy relative closeness.Step 10: Write the whole closed-form fuzzy relative closenessRC3U(α).According to Eqs.

Using Eq. (5), the final ranking of the alternatives is A2≻A3≻A1.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Personnel selection is a critical strategic decision in knowledge-intensive enterprises, which determines the input quality of human resource, and plays an important part in human resource management. Personnel selection, which involves some uncertainties of the performances and weights, has been considered as a fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. Fuzzy TOPSIS extensions, as a class of fuzzy MCDM methods, have been applied in personnel selection decisions. Currently, all the researches about this topic either apply crisp relative closeness, or employ the approximate fuzzy relative closeness estimate to rank the alternatives, which will result in information loss and bring complicated computation.In this paper, we have proposed an accurate analytical solution to fuzzy TOPSIS method, and have applied it in a decision making problem regarding the personnel selection in a software enterprise. Firstly, based on KM algorithm, we have introduced the fractional nonlinear programming (NLP) models. Using the idea of α level, we have considered α as a variable in the analytical solution, not the cut sets that dividing interval [0, 1, ] into many equal slices. Secondly, we have identified the switch points through solving difference functions. Finally, the analytical expression of fuzzy relative closeness for fuzzy TOPSIS method can be obtained. Compared with the existing method obtaining fuzzy relative closeness, the advantages of the proposed method is that it is computationally efficient, as the KM algorithm transforms the fractional NLP problem into identifying the switch points of α level, and the computation can be merged into once when some intervals have the same switch point. It is accurate, since the fuzzy relative closeness is obtained by the analytical expressions, not the artificial division of the α within interval [0, 1]. Moreover, the proposed analytical method gives a global accurate picture of the fuzzy relative closeness, which provides a possibility to discuss the inner property of the fuzzy TOPSIS.
