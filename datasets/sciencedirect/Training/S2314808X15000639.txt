@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The purpose of this paper is to introduce and study a new class of fuzzy sets called (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets and (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets in double fuzzy topological spaces. Furthermore, the relationships between the new concepts are introduced and established with some interesting examples.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A progressive development of fuzzy sets [1] has been made to discover the fuzzy analogues of the crisp sets theory. On the other hand, the idea of intuitionistic fuzzy sets was first introduced by Atanassov [2]. Later on, Çoker [3] presented the notion of intuitionistic fuzzy topology. Samanta and Mondal [4], introduced and characterized the intuitionistic gradation of openness of fuzzy sets which is a generalization of smooth topology and the topology of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The name “intuitionistic” is discontinued in mathematics and applications. Garcia and Rodabaugh [5] concluded that they work under the name “double”.In 2009, Omari and Noorani [6] introduced generalized b-closed sets (briefly, gb-closed) in general topology. As a generalization of the results in References 6 and 7, we introduce and study (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets in double fuzzy topological spaces, then a new class of fuzzy sets between an (r, s)-fuzzy b-closed sets and an (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets namely (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets is introduced and investigated. Finally, the relationships between (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed and (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets are introduced and established with some interesting counter examples.Throughout this paper, X will be a non-empty set, I = [0, 1], I0 = (0, 1] and I1 = [0, 1). A fuzzy set λ is quasi-coincident with a fuzzy set µ (denoted by, λqµ) iff there exists x ∈ X such thatλ(x)+μ(x)>1and they are not quasi-coincident otherwise (denoted by,λq¯μ). The family of all fuzzy sets on X is denoted by IX. By0¯and1¯, we denote the smallest and the greatest fuzzy sets on X. For a fuzzy set λ ∈ IX,1¯−λdenotes its complement. All other notations are standard notations of fuzzy set theory.Now, we recall the following definitions which are useful in the sequel.Definition 2.1(see [4]) A double fuzzy topology (τ, τ*) on X is a pair of maps τ, τ* : IX→ I, which satisfies the following properties:The triplet (X, τ, τ*) is called a double fuzzy topological space (briefly, dfts). A fuzzy set λ is called an (r, s)-fuzzy open (briefly, (r, s)-fo) if τ(λ) ≥ r and τ*(λ) ≤ s. A fuzzy set λ is called an (r, s)-fuzzy closed (briefly, (r, s)-fc) set iff1¯−λis an (r, s)-fo set.Theorem 2.1(see [8]) Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. Then double fuzzy closure operator and double fuzzy interior operator of λ ∈ IXare defined byLet (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. For each λ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. A fuzzy set λ is called:1.An (r, s)-fuzzy semiopen (see [9]) (briefly, (r, s)-fso) ifλ≤Cτ,τ*(Iτ,τ*(λ,r,s),r,s). λ is called an (r, s)-fuzzy semi closed (briefly, (r, s)-fsc) iff1¯−λis an (r, s)-fso set.An (r, s)-generalized fuzzy closed (see [10]) (briefly, (r, s)-gfc) ifCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤μ, λ ≤ µ, τ(µ) ≥ r and τ*(µ) ≤ s. λ is called an (r, s)-generalized fuzzy open (briefly, (r, s)-gfo) iff1¯−λis (r, s)-gfc set.(see [11,12]) Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. For each λ, µ ∈ IXand r ∈ I0, s ∈ I1. Then, a fuzzy set λ is said to be (r, s)-fuzzy generalized ψρ-closed (briefly, (r, s)-fgψρ-closed) ifψCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤μsuch that λ ≤ µ and µ is (r, s)-fuzzy ρ-open set. λ is called (r, s)-fuzzy generalized ψρ-open (briefly, (r, s)-fgψρ-open) iff1¯−λis (r, s)-fgψρ-closed set.In this section, we introduce and study some basic properties of a new class of fuzzy sets called an (r, s)-fuzzy b-closed sets and an (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed.Definition 3.1Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. For each λ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. A fuzzy set λ is called:1.An (r, s)-fuzzy b-closed (briefly, (r, s)-fbc) ifλ≥(Iτ,τ*(Cτ,τ*(λ,r,s),r,s))∧(Cτ,τ*(Iτ,τ*(λ,r,s),r,s)).λ is called an (r, s)-fuzzy b-open (briefly, (r, s)-fbo) iff1¯−λis (r, s)-fbc set.An (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed (briefly, (r, s)-gfbc) ifbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤μ, λ ≤ µ, τ(µ) ≥ r and τ*(µ) ≤ s. λ is called an (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-open (briefly, (r, s)-gfbo) iff1¯−λis (r, s)-gfbc set.Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. Then double fuzzy b-closure operator and double fuzzy b-interior operator of λ ∈ IXare defined byEvery (r, s)-fbc set is an (r, s)-gfbc set.The converse of the above remark may be not true as shown by the following example.Example 3.1Let X = {a, b}. Defined µ, α and β by:Then β is an(12,12)-gfbc set but not an(12,12)-fbc set.Definition 3.3Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts, λ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. λ is called an (r, s)-fuzzy b-Q-neighborhood of xt∈ Pt(X) if there exists an (r, s)-fbo set µ ∈ IXsuch that xtqµ and µ ≤ λ.The family of all (r, s)-fuzzy b-Q-neighborhood of xtdenoted byb-Q(xt​,r,s).Theorem 3.1Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. Then for each λ, µ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1, the operatorbCτ,τ*satisfies the following statements:(1), (2), (3), and (4) are proved easily.(5) Letμq¯λand µ is an (r, s)-fbo set, thenλ≤1¯−μ. But we have, µqλ iffμqbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)andbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤bCτ,τ*(1¯−μ,r,s)=1¯−μ,soμq¯bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s), which is contradiction. Then µqλ iffμqbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).(6) Let xtbe a fuzzy point such thatxt≰bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s). Then there is an (r, s)-fuzzy b-Q neighborhood µ of xtsuch thatμq¯λ. But by (5), we have an (r, s)-fuzzy b-Q-neighborhood µ of xtsuch thatμq¯bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)Also,xt≰bCτ,τ*(bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s),r,s).ThenbCτ,τ*(bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s),r,s)≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).But we have,bCτ,τ*(bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s),r,s)≥bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).ThereforebCτ,τ*(bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s),r,s)=bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).(7) and (8) are obvious.Theorem 3.2Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. Then for each λ, µ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1, the operatorbIτ,τ*satisfies the following statements:1.bIτ,τ*(1¯−λ,r,s)=1¯−bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s),bCτ,τ*(1¯−λ,r,s)=1¯−bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s),bIτ,τ*(0¯,r,s)=0¯,bIτ,τ*(1¯,r,s)=1¯,bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤λ,If λ is an (r, s)-fbo, thenλ=bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s),If λ ≤ µ, thenbIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤bIτ,τ*(μ,r,s),bIτ,τ*(bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s),r,s)=bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s),bIτ,τ*(λ∨μ,r,s)≥bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)∨bIτ,τ*(μ,r,s),bIτ,τ*(λ∧μ,r,s)≤bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)∧bIτ,τ*(μ,r,s).It is similar to Theorem 3.1.Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. λ ∈ IXis (r, s)-gfbo set, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 if and only ifμ≤bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)whenever µ ≤ λ,τ(1¯−μ)≥randτ*(1¯−μ)≤s.Suppose that λ is an (r, s)-gfbo set in IX, and letτ(1¯−μ)≥randτ*(1¯−μ)≤ssuch that µ ≤ λ. By the definition,1¯−λis an (r, s)-gfbc set in IX. So,Also,1¯−bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤1¯−μ.And then,μ≤bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s).Conversely, let µ ≤ λ,τ(1¯−μ)≥randτ*(1¯−μ)≤s, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such thatμ≤bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s). Now1¯−bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤1¯−μ,ThusbCτ,τ*(1¯−λ,r,s)≤1¯−μ.That is,1¯−λis an (r, s)-gfbc set, then λ is an (r, s)-gfbo set.Theorem 3.4Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts, λ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. If λ is an (r, s)-gfbc set, then1.bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λdoes not contain any non-zero (r, s)-fc sets.λ is an (r, s)-fbc iffbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λis (r, s)-fc.µ is (r, s)-gfbc set for each set µ ∈ IXsuch thatλ≤μ≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).For each (r, s)-fo set µ ∈ IXsuch that µ ≤ λ, µ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to λ if and only if µ is an (r, s)-gfbc in IX.For each an (r, s)-fbo set µ ∈ IXsuch thatbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)q¯μiffλq¯μ.(1) Suppose thatτ(1¯−μ)≥randτ*(1¯−μ)≤s, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such thatμ≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λwhenever λ ∈ IXis an (r, s)-gfbc set. Since1¯−μis an (r, s)-fo set,(2) Let λ be an (r, s)-gfbc set. So, for each r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 if λ is an (r, s)-fbc set then,bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λ=0¯which is an (r, s)-fc set.Conversely, suppose thatbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λis an (r, s)-fc set. Then by (1),bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λdoes not contain any non-zero an (r, s)-fc set. ButbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λis an (r, s)-fc set, thenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λ=0¯⇒λ=bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).So, λ is an (r, s)-fbc set.(3) Suppose that τ(α) ≥ r and τ*(α) ≤ s where r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such that µ ≤ α and let λ be an (r, s)-gfbc set such that λ ≤ α. ThenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤α.So,bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)=bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s),ThereforebCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)≤α.So, µ is an (r, s)-gfbc set.(4) Let λ be an (r, s)-gfbc and τ(λ) ≥ r and τ*(λ) ≤ s, where r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. ThenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤λ. But, µ ≤ λ so,bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤λ.Also, since µ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to λ, thenλ∧bCτ,τ*(λ)(μ,r,s)=bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s),sobCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)=bCτ,τ*(λ)(μ,r,s)≤λ.Now, if µ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to λ and τ(α) ≥ r and τ*(α) ≤ s where r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such that µ ≤ α, then for each an (r, s)-fo set α ∧ λ,μ=μ∧λ≤α∧λ. Hence µ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to λ,bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)=bCτ,τ*(λ)(μ,r,s)≤(α∧λ)≤α.Therefore, µ is an (r, s)-gfbc in IX.Conversely, let µ be an (r, s)-gfbc set in IXand τ(α) ≥ r and τ*(α) ≤ s whenever α ≤ λ such that µ ≤ α, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Then for each an (r, s)-fo set β ∈ IX, α = β ∧ λ. But we have, µ is an (r, s)-gfbc set in IXsuch that µ ≤ β,bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)≤β⇒bCτ,τ*(λ)(μ,r,s)=bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)∧λ≤β∧λ=α.That is, µ is an (r, s)-gfbc relative to λ.(5) Suppose µ is an (r, s)-fbo andλq¯μ, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Thenλ≤(1¯−μ). Since(1¯−μ)is an (r, s)-fbc set of IXand λ is an (r, s)-gfbc set, thenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)q¯μ.Conversely, let µ be an (r, s)-fbc set of IXsuch that λ ≤ µ, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Thenλq¯(1¯−μ).ButbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)q¯(1¯−μ)⇒bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤μ.Hence λ is an (r, s)-gfbc.Proposition 3.1Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts, λ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1.1.If λ is an (r, s)-gfbc and an (r, s)-fbo set, then λ is an (r, s)-fbc set.If λ is an (r, s)-fo and an (r, s)-gfbc, then λ ∧ µ is an (r, s)-gfbc set wheneverμ≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).(1) Suppose λ is an (r, s)-gfbc and an (r, s)-fbo set such that λ ≤ λ, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. ThenBut we have,λ≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).Then,λ=bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).Therefore, λ is an (r, s)-fbc set.(2) Suppose that λ is an (r, s)-fo and an (r, s)-gfbc set, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. ThenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤λ⇒λis an(r,s)-fbc set⇒λ∧μis an(r,s)-fbc⇒λ∧μis an(r,s)-gfbc.In this section, we introduce and study some properties of a new class of fuzzy sets called an (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy closed sets and an (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed setsDefinition 4.1Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. For each λ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. A fuzzy set λ is called:1.An (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy closed (briefly, (r, s)-g ⋆fc) ifCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤μwhenever λ ≤ µ and µ is an (r, s)-gfo set in IX. λ is called an (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy open (briefly, (r, s)-g ⋆fo) iff1¯−λis (r, s)-g ⋆fc set.An (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed (briefly, (r, s)-g ⋆fbc) ifbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤μwhenever λ ≤ µ and µ is an (r, s)-gfo set in IX. λ is called an (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-open (briefly, (r, s)-g ⋆fbo) iff1¯−λis (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set.Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. λ ∈ IXis an (r, s)-g ⋆fbo set if and only ifμ≤bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)whenever µ is an (r, s)-gfc, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1.Suppose that λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbo set in IX, and let µ is an (r, s)-gfc set such that µ ≤ λ, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. So by the definition, we have1¯−λis an (r, s)-gfo set in IXand1¯−λ≤1¯−μ. But1¯−λis an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set, thenbCτ,τ*(1¯−λ,r,s)≤1¯−μ. ButTherefore,μ≤bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s).Conversely, suppose thatμ≤bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)whenever µ ≤ λ and µ is an (r, s)-gfc set, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Now1¯−bIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤1¯−μ,ThusbCτ,τ*(1¯−λ,r,s)≤1¯−μ.Therefore,1¯−λis an (r, s)-gfbc set and λ is an (r, s)-gfbo set.Proposition 4.1Let (X, τ, τ*) be dfts's. For each λ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I11.If a fuzzy set λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, thenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λcontains no non-zero (r, s)-gfc set.If a fuzzy set λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, thenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λis an (r, s)-g ⋆fbo.An (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set λ is an (r, s)-fbc iffbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λis an (r, s)-fbc set.If a fuzzy set λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, thenμ=1¯, whenever µ is an (r, s)-gfo set andbIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)∨(1¯−λ)≤μ.(1) Suppose that λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set and µ is an (r, s)-gfc set of IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 such thatAndλ≤1¯−μ.But λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set and1¯−μis an (r, s)-gfo set, thenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤1¯−μ⇒μ≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)∧(1¯−bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s))=0¯.ThereforebCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λcontains no non-zero (r, s)-gfc set.(2) Let λ be an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Then by (1) we have,bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λcontains no non-zero (r, s)-gfc set. So,bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λis an (r, s)-g ⋆fbo set.(3) Let λ be an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set. If λ is an (r, s)-fbc, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1, thenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λ=0¯.Conversely, letbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λis an (r, s)-fbc set in IXand λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1, then by (1) we have,bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λcontains no non-zero (r, s)-gfc set. Then,bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)−λ=0¯,that isbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)=λ.Hence λ is an (r, s)-fbc set.(4) Let µ be an (r, s)-gfc set andbIτ,τ*(λ,r,s)∨(1¯−λ)≤μ, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Hence1¯−μ≤bCτ,τ*(1¯−λ,r,s)∧λ=bCτ,τ*(1¯−λ,r,s)−(1¯−λ).But(1¯−μ)is an (r, s)-gfc and1¯−λis an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc by (1),1¯−μ=0¯and henceμ=1¯.Proposition 4.2Let (X, τ, τ*) be dfts's. For each λ and µ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1.1.If λ and µ are (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then λ∧µ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc.If λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and τ(µ) ≥ r, τ*(µ) ≤ s, then λ ∧ µ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc.(1) Suppose that λ and µ are (r, s)-g ⋆fbc sets in IXsuch that λ ∧ µ ≤ ν for each an (r, s)-gfo set ν ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. Since λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc,(2) Since every an (r, s)-fc set is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and from (1) we get the proof.Proposition 4.3Let (X, τ, τ*) be dfts's. For each λ and µ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1.1.If λ is both an (r, s)-gfo and an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then λ is an (r, s)-fbc set.If λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc andλ≤μ≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s), then µ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc.(1) Suppose that λ is an (r, s)-gfo and an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc in IXsuch thatbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤μ, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. ButThereforeλ=bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).Hence λ is an (r, s)-fbc set.(2) Suppose that λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and ν is an (r, s)-gfo set in IXsuch that µ ≤ ν for each µ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1. So λ ≤ ν. But we have, λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, thenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤ν.NowbCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)≤bCτ,τ*(bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s),r,s)=bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤ν.Therefore µ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc set.Theorem 4.2Let(X,τ1​,τ1*)and(Y,τ2​,τ2*)be dfts's. Ifλ≤1¯Y≤1¯Xsuch that λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc in IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1, then λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to Y.Suppose that(X,τ1​,τ1*)and(Y,τ2​,τ2*)are dfts's such thatλ≤1¯Y≤1¯X, r ∈ I0, s ∈ I1 and λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc in IX. Now, letλ≤1¯Y∧μsuch that µ is an (r, s)-gfo set in IX. But we have, λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc in IX,So that1¯Y∧bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤1¯Y∧μ.Hence λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to Y.Theorem 4.3Let(X,τ1​,τ1*)be adfts. For each λ and µ ∈ IX, r ∈ I0 and s ∈ I1 with µ ≤ λ. If µ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to λ such that λ is both an (r, s)-gfo and (r, s)-g ⋆fbc of IX, then µ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to X.Suppose that µ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and τ(ν) ≥ r and τ*(ν) ≤ s such that µ ≤ ν, r ∈ I0, s ∈ I1. But we have,μ≤λ≤1¯, therefore µ ≤ λ and µ ≤ ν. SoAlso we have, µ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to λ,λ∧bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)≤λ∧ν⇒λ∧bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)≤ν.Thus(λ∧bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s))∨(1¯−bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s))≤ν∨(1¯−bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)).⇒λ∨(1¯−bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s))≤ν∨(1¯−bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)).Since λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, thenbCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤ν∨(1¯−μ).Also,μ≤λ⇒bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s).ThusbCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)≤bCτ,τ*(λ,r,s)≤ν∨(1¯−bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)).ThereforebCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)≤ν, butbCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)is not contained in(1¯−bCτ,τ*(μ,r,s)). That is, µ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc relative to X.The following implication illustrates the relationships between different fuzzy sets:None of these implications is reversible where A → B represents A implies B, as shown by the following examples. But at this stage we do not have information regarding the relationship between an (r, s)-gfbc and (r, s)-g ⋆fc sets.Example 5.1(1) LetX={a,b,c}and let µ and α are fuzzy sets defined by:Define (τ, τ*) on X as follows:τ(λ)={1,ifλ∈{0¯,1¯},12,ifλ=μ,0,otherwise.τ*(λ)={0,ifλ∈{0¯,1¯},12,ifλ=μ,1,otherwise.Then α is an(12,12)-gfbc set, but not an(12,12)-g ⋆fbc set.(2) Take X = {a, b} in (1) and define µ, α and β by:μ(a)=0.6,μ(b)=0.6,α(a)=0.3,α(b)=0.2,β(a)=0.4,β(b)=0.5.Then β is an(12,12)-g ⋆fbc set, but not an(12,12)-fbc set.(3) LetX={a,b,c}. Define µ, ν and γ by:μ(a)=1.0,μ(b)=0.5,μ(c)=0.3,ν(a)=1.0,ν(b)=0.6,ν(c)=0.0,γ(a)=0.0,γ(b)=0.6,γ(c)=0.0.Define (τ, τ*) as in (1). Then ν is an(12,12)-g ⋆fbc set but not an(12,12)-fc set and not an(12,12)-gfc. And γ is an(12,12)-g ⋆fbc set, but not an(12,12)-fsc set.(4) Take (3) and defined µ and ν by:μ(a)=1.0,μ(b)=1.0,μ(c)=0.6,ν(a)=0.3,ν(b)=0.5,ν(c)=0.5.Define (τ, τ*) as in (1). Then ν is an(12,12)-g ⋆fbc set, but not an(12,12)-g ⋆fc set.(5) See Example 3.1. Clearly β is an(12,12)-gfbc set, but not an(12,12)-gfc set.(6) Let X = {a, b}. Define µ, ν and γ as follows:μ(a)=0.7,μ(b)=0.6,ν(a)=0.3,ν(b)=0.2,γ(a)=0.4,γ(b)=0.5.Define (τ, τ*) as in (1). Then ν is an(12,12)-fbc set but not an(12,12)-fsc set, also not an(12,12)-gfc.(7) LetX={a,b,c}and let µ and α as fuzzy sets defined by:μ(a)=0.9,μ(b)=0.8,μ(c)=0.3,α(a)=0.1,α(b)=0.8,α(c)=0.3.Define (τ, τ*) on X by:τ(λ)={1,ifλ∈{0¯,1¯},0.6,ifλ=μ,0,otherwise.τ*(λ)={0,ifλ∈{0¯,1¯},0.3,ifλ=μ,1,otherwise.Then α is an(0.6,0.3)-fsc set, but not an(0.6,0.3)-fc set.(8) Let X = {a, b} and let µ and α as fuzzy sets defined by:μ(a)=0.9,μ(b)=0.4,α(a)=0.1,α(b)=0.8.Define (τ, τ*) on X by:τ(λ)={1,ifλ∈{0¯,1¯},12,ifλ=μ,0,otherwise.τ*(λ)={0,ifλ∈{0¯,1¯},12,ifλ=μ,1,otherwise.Then µ is an(12,12)-g ⋆fc set, but not an(12,12)-fc set.
