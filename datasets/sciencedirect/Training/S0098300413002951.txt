@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Abundant marine fossils, especially with elongated shapes (e.g., belemnites), are useful indicators to draw conclusions about influencing factors (e.g., sea floor paleocurrents and transport mechanisms) of paleoenvironments. Since Hall (1843) regarded the orientation of brachiopod valves as current induced, a series of studies have been conducted concerning fossil orientation measurements (Potter and Pettijohn, 1977). Orthocone cephalopods (e.g., nautiloids like Orthoceras; Wendt et al., 1984; Wendt, 1995), gastropods (e.g., Seilacher, 1959, 1960; Wendt, 1995; Cataldo et al., 2013), bivalves (Kelling and Moshrif, 1977), foraminifers (King, 1948), tentaculite shells (Hladil et al., 1996), trilobites (Seilacher, 1959, 1960) and vertebrate bones (e.g. Vasiļkova et al., 2012) have been used so far in field-based spatial orientation studies (Flügel, 2004). Kidwell et al. (1986) analyzed two-dimensional geometries of skeletal accumulations with focus on their preferred orientation. However, the indication of current patterns is not only restricted to fossils with elongated basic shape and their nature to be reoriented by any kind of current. Planispirally coiled (disk-shaped) forms like gastropods, but also cephalopods such as ammonoids can also provide such depositional information (e.g., Futterer, 1982; Wendt, 1995; Lukeneder, 2005; Olivero, 2007; Seilacher, 1971; Wani, 2006, 2007).The main aim of this study is to present a novel method for analyzing spatial orientation, which can be adapted to all kinds of abundant solid matter such as fossils and particles or to geological features such as faults, folds or rock core analyses.The application of 3D-visualization on different kinds of objects and in different scientific fields has increased enormously. Since Sollas (1903) introduced the method of serial sectioning within his work on Therapsida and Lysorophia (Camp and Hanna, 1937), 3D-visualization has been adapted for a wide field of paleontological studies (e.g., VanderHoof, 1931; Simpson, 1933; Koslowski, 1932; Stensiö, 1927; Fourie, 1974; Conroy and Vannier, 1984; Ketcham and Carlson, 2001; Marschallinger, 2001, 2011; Dockner, 2006; Sutton, 2008; Garwood et al., 2010; Briguglio et al., 2011; Kruta et al., 2011; Lukeneder, 2012). The most obvious method used for digitization today is computed tomography (CT) with all its derivatives (e.g., macro-CT, µ-CT, nano-CT, etc.). However, CT is not always successful, particularly when the density contrast of the involved materials is too low. This is exactly the case for the herein presented ammonoid mass occurrence, caused by the almost equal density of the ammonoid shells (i.e., secondary calcite shells, 2.6–2.8g/cm3) and the embedding source rock (limestone, 2.8g/cm3). Therefore, we applied the classic method of serial-grinding, despite its invasive and (partially or entirely) destructive character. If samples are large enough to sacrifice fractions of it, serial grinding represents a good alternative in cases when digital recording methods fail, because in addition to a good resolution, color information (not available in CT-scans) can be obtained as well.In our approach, we focus on the three-dimensional reconstructions of the ammonoids from the entire bed, instead of focusing on the fossil orientation on the surface of a sedimentary horizon. This and the spatial analysis of their orientation within a stereographic projection plot are the main innovations of this study compared to other conventional fossil-orientation-studies. An overview over the entire approach, from fossil collection to orientation analyses, can be gleaned fromFig. 1.The directional data are derived from a monospecific (>99%) ammonoid mass occurrence of Kasimlarceltites krystyni (Lukeneder and Lukeneder, in press). The mass occurrence is situated within the Taurus Mountains of Turkey, at the Kasimlar Formation of the section Aşağiyaylabel, about 90km northeast of Antalya and 70km southeast of Isparta (WGS 84N 37° 33' 05'', E 31° 18'14'';Fig. 2A). It is part of a limestone bed (Fig. 2A and B), deposited during the Late Triassic (234mya) within an intrashelf-basin at the western end of the “Cimmerian terranes” (western Tethys Ocean; Şengör et al., 1984; Dercourt et al., 1993, 2000; Gindl, 2000; Scotese et al., 1989; Scotese, 1998, 2001; Stampfli and Borel, 2002; Stampfli et al., 2002; Lukeneder et al., 2012). The deposition of this mass occurrence during an important time-slice makes them suitable for investigations related to conclusions about its paleoenvironment. The reference material of this limestone bed has been collected during a field trip in 2007. The resulting raw-data-slices as well as the extant material are stored at the Natural History Museum of Vienna (NHMW-2012/0133/0480-550).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In our study, we introduce a new method, which combines digital fossil-segmentation, subsequent 3D-reconstruction and calculation of spatial ammonoid-orientation, performed on a Triassic ammonoid mass occurrence, deposited within a limestone layer, at Aşağiyaylabel (Taurus Mountains, Southern Turkey). Since computed tomography could not be used for digitization because of insufficient density contrast, the classic method of serial grinding was applied. A block, 150×45×140mm3, of the limestone layer was ground and 70 slices with a distance of 2mm were scanned in longitudinal direction (from 1A to 1C; Fig. 2B). The semi-automatic region growing tool of Amira was applied for segmentation and 3D-reconstruction of the ammonoids. Six orientation parameters, already known from geological features, were calculated from these ammonoids. The use of the Cartesian coordinates of three different landmarks, placed on three particular points of each ammonoid, made it possible to calculate the orientation parameters and therefore the spatial orientation of 675 segmented ammonoids from a 26mm part of the whole block. The analyses, via rose diagrams and Schmidt net plots, show a general NW/SE orientation of the aperture direction of the ammonoids, as well as a slightly SE inclination of the whole ammonoids, indicating a slight but significant sediment movement or even possible a current direction toward NW.Using this method in an ongoing study, the orientation of all ammonoids from the whole block will be investigated. The statistical orientation of all ammonoids from the mass occurrence, combined with additional 2D-reconstructions and facies-analyses of the limestone-layer, should lead to more detailed conclusions about the depositional conditions of the ammonoid mass occurrence. The newly established method can be used as template for measuring spatial orientations on all kinds of fossil mass occurrences or other geological objects. A new animation clip (see Supplementary material) explains all steps, from segmentation, over surface-reconstruction to landmark-positioning, within the software package Amira, hence helping to apply this method to comparable material and scientific fields.
