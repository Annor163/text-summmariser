@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The fixed grid finite element method is introduced to approximate the effective moduli of particulate composite. The difficulty of domain discretization induced by the inclusions is avoided in the fixed grid finite element method, as the discretization is independent of the inclusions. The elastic properties of every finite element are approximated by a weighted function, and the volume fractions of the constituents in the element are taken as the weights. A simple scheme is proposed to approximate the volume fractions in every element. The validities of the fixed grid finite element method are verified, by comparing the effective moduli obtained from the fixed grid finite element method with those obtained from finite element method. The anisotropy of particulate composite is discussed with the fixed grid finite element, and the applicability of the fixed grid finite element method for composite with multiple irregular inclusions is illustrated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Particulate composite like the polymer matrix composite, metal matrix composite, and ceramic composite has vast application. Particulate composite is reinforced with regular or irregular particle inclusions, which have different phases from the matrix. Two-phase composite can be categorized into three kinds in terms of the inclusion-to-matrix modulus ratio [1]: (1) composites with high inclusion-to-matrix modulus ratio larger than 20; (2) composites with low inclusion-to-matrix modulus ratio ranging from 1 to 5; and (3) composite with inclusion-to-matrix modulus ratio smaller than 1.0. Particulate composite has the advantage of blending the properties of individual materials [2]. However, the determination of the effective moduli of particulate composite is a challenging issue as the coexistence of multiple phases in it. Great efforts have been made in the past few decades to predict the effective moduli of particulate composite with a variety of analytical and numerical methods.Based on the pioneering work by Eshelby [3] on the elastic stress field of a composite with a single inclusion when it is subjected to far-field stresses, some analytical solutions are proposed to calculate the effective moduli of particulate composite. The analytical methods single out themselves by considering the interaction between the inclusions with their unique ways, while the dilute solution is an exception as it ignores the interaction between the inclusions [4]. In the self-consistent method (SC) [5,6], the interaction between the inclusions is considered by assuming that inclusions are inserted into the equivalent medium rather than the matrix. In the direct derivative method (IDD) [7] and the Mori–Tanaka method (MT) [8,9], the original far-field traction applied on the surface of the composite is replaced with a new one to consider the interaction between the inclusions. The differential method [10] assumes that inclusion is gradually inserted into the medium with known equivalent elastic modulus. The generalized self-consistent method (GSC) [11] assumes that the inclusion and the matrix are bounded by the infinite equivalent medium to consider the interactions between the inclusions. There are some disadvantages for the analytical methods. Generally, these analytical methods require the explicit solution of eigen strain [3] for inclusions, which can be achieved only for some regular inclusions. In addition, most of the analytical methods have limited ability to study the anisotropy of particulate composite.The finite element method [12-23], as well as the boundary element method [24-27], is an important alternative tool to calculate the effective moduli of particulate composite. The challenging problem for finite element method is mesh generation, especially when the representative volume element (RVE) is 3D and the inclusions in it are irregular and multi-shaped. This is due to the requirement of fitted mesh, which means that the interface between the phases in the RVE should be perfectly represented by the boundaries of the elements. A variety of measures have been tried to deal with the problem. These measures include the application of digital image technique where each pixel and voxel represents a 2-D and 3-D finite element, respectively [12,19,28], unified application of state-of-art software packages [16,21], and the combination of extended finite element techniques with level set method [15,20]. However, mesh generation for particulate composite with arbitrary inclusion shapes is still not an easy task [15], as the requirement of the fitted mesh is too strict. Recently, an iterative finite element method [29] is proposed to approximate the effective moduli of particulate composite. Although the method avoids the difficulty of domain discretization, it is only applicable to the case with the inclusion-to-matrix modulus ratio lower than 2.The fundamental character of particulate composite is that it is multi-phased. In recent years, the technique of fixed grid finite element method (FGFEM) [30] has been successfully applied to tackle multi-phased problems. The applications include fluid–structure interaction [31], phase transformation [32], heat conduction [33], and unconfined seepage [34,35]. Garcia extends the method into elasticity problems [36], followed by the application for shape optimization [37], and the dynamic analysis of structures with holes [38,39].In this paper, a numerical scheme based on FGFEM is introduced to approximate the effective moduli of particulate composite. The difficulty of domain discretization is avoided in FGFEM, as RVE is discretized with finite elements independently and the inclusions are not involved in the discretization. Unlike the iterative finite element method [29], this method can be applied to composite with much high inclusion-to-matrix modulus ratio. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the theoretical basis to calculate the effective moduli of particulate composite is introduced for self-completeness. In Section 3, the concept of FGFEM, as well as the proposed numerical scheme, is introduced. The verification and some application of FGFEM along with some discussion are supplied in Section 4. Some conclusions are made in Section 5.Set the RVE of a particulate composite as shown inFig. 1 applied with a tractionσ0⋅non its surface, of whichnis the unit outward normal on the surface. With the assumption of no bound slip on the constituent interface in the RVE, the strain energy of the RVE is(1)U=12σij0C¯ijmnσmn0Vof whichUis the strain energy,σij0is a component ofσ0,C¯ijmnis a component of the effective compliance stiffness tensor of the RVE, and V is the volume of the RVE. The summation convention is used for repeated indices in this section.Alternatively, we have(2)U=12∫Vσijεijdvwhereσijis a component of the stress tensor in the RVE, andεijis a component of the strain. Due to the symmetry ofεijandσij, Eq. (2) is recast into(3)U=12∫V(σijui),jdv−12∫Vσij,juidvwhereuiis a displacement component.According to the equilibrium condition, i.e.,σij,j=0, and the divergence theorem, Eq. (3) is simplified into(4)U=12∫sσijnjuidswhere s is the surface area of RVE. Obviously,σijnjequalsσij0njon the RVE surface. Therefore, Eq. (4) is rewritten into(5)U=12σij0∫snjuidsBased on the divergence theorem, Eq. (5) is rewritten into(6)U=12σij0∫VεijdV=12σij0ε¯ijVwhereε¯ijis the average strain in RVE.It is seen in Eqs. (1) and (6) that the essence of determiningC¯ijmnis to determine the relationship betweenε¯ijandσmn0. By settingε¯ij=C'ijmnσmn0, we have(7)C¯ijmn=(Cijmn′+Cmnij′)/2Therefore, the effective compliance moduli of the composite can be determined based on the relationship between the applied traction and the average strain in the composite. Similarly, a displacement field can be applied on the RVE surface to determine the effective stiffness moduli of the composite.In FGFEM, the analysis domain of interest is enclosed by a smallest bounding box as shown inFig. 2. Unlike the traditional finite element method that discretizes the analysis domain regularly or irregularly for fitted mesh, FGFEM discretizes the bounding box with regular finite elements resulting in non-fitted mesh. Therefore, the elements in the bounding box as shown in Fig. 2 are classified into three types [36]: (a) the inside elements which are completely enclosed by the physical domain; (b) the outside elements which completely lay out of the physical domain, and (c) the boundary elements which cover the boundary of the physical domain.For a particulate composite, its RVE coincides with the bounding box, and it also has three type of elements: (a) the inclusion elements which have a single inclusion phase; (b) the matrix elements which only have matrix phase; and (c) the hybrid elements which have at least two phases.In FGFEM, the conventional stiffness matrix is used to construct the FGFEM equations [36]. This yields(8)[ke]=∫Ωe[B]T[D][B]dxwhere[ke]is the element stiffness matrix,Ωeis the element domain,[B]is the strain matrix, and[D]is the constitutive matrix.It is seen in Eq. (8) that the key issue for FGGEM is on how to determine the constitutive matrix for every hybrid element. By the assumption of consistent strain over the element, it yields(9)[kHe]=∑i=1m∫Ωei[B]T[Di][B]dxwhere[kHe]is the element stiffness matrix of a hybrid element, m is the number of constituents in the hybrid element,Ωeiis the domain of the i-th constituent in the hybrid element, and[Di]is the constitutive matrix of the i-th constituent. Eq. (9) is approximated in the following way [36].(10)[kHe]≈∑i=1mci∫Ωe[B]T[Di][B]dxwhereciis the area/volume fraction of the i-th constituent in the hybrid element. Therefore, the stiffness matrix for all types of elements are uniformly expressed as(11)[ke]=∫Ωe[B]T(∑i=1mci[D]i)[B]dxIt is seen in Eq. (11) thatciis treated as a weighted function.The topology between the inclusions and the finite elements needs to be explicitly expressed for accurate ciin each finite element. This is hard to be accomplished when the inclusions are irregular. A scheme is proposed to calculate ciapproximately, with a 2D case taken as an example for the introduction for convenience. For a hybrid element as shown inFig. 3, it is divided into sub-elements regularly. The sub-elements are categorized into two groups. The sub-elements in the first group are completely enclosed by a single constituent and denoted ase¯in Fig. 3(a), the sub-elements in the second group have at least two constituents and denoted ase˜in Fig. 3(a). The sub-elements in the second group are subdivided as shown in Fig. 3(b). The subdivision procedure is repeated until the following condition is satisfied(12)1−∑Se¯Se<εcwhereSe¯is the area of alle¯-type sub-elements in the element,Seis the area of the hybrid element, andεcis the specified tolerance and it is taken as 0.04 in this paper. When the subdivision is finished, the area of each constituent in the hybrid elements can be approximated based on the assumption that everye¯-type sub-element is homogeneous and its property is represented by the property of the constituent in its center. The calculation ofcican be approximated with the area of all sub-elements in the finite element. The advantage of the approximation method is that it is not necessary to get the exact intersection between finite elements and inclusions.It is easy to see that the precision of FGFEM is dependent on the mesh density. The reason is that the area/volume of the hybrid elements decreases with increasing mesh density, accompanied by the increasing precision. An index is introduced to measure the effect of mesh density for 3D composite(13)ce=(VI+VM)/Vwhere ceis defined as the effective volume ratio, VIis the summation of the volume of all inclusion elements, VMis the summation of the volume of all matrix elements, and V is the RVE volume.
