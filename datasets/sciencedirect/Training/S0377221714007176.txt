@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we treat the problem of stochastic comparison of standby [active] redundancy at component level versus system level. In the case of standby redundancy, we present some interesting comparison results of both series systems and parallel systems in the sense of various stochastic orderings for both the matching spares case and non-matching spares case, respectively. In the case of active redundancy, a likelihood ratio ordering result of series systems is presented for the matching spares case; and for the non-matching spares case, a counterexample is provided to show that there does not exist similar result even for the hazard rate ordering. The results established here strengthen and generalize some of those known in the literature. Some numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the theoretical results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In order to optimize the lifetime of a coherent system, one efficient method is to add redundancy components to the system. This topic has posed many interesting problems to which many researchers have devoted themselves in the past decades; see, for example, Boland, El-Neweihi, and Proschan (1992); Shaked and Shanthikumar (1992); Singh and Misra (1994); Singh and Singh (1997); Mi (1998); Ramirez-Marquez and Coit (2004); Yalaoui, Chu, and Châtelet (2005); da Costa Bueno (2005); Valdés and Zequeira (2006); da Costa Bueno and do Carmo (2007); Hu and Wang (2009); Valdés, Arango, and Zequeira (2010); Brito, Zequeira, and Valdès (2011); Misra, Dhariyal, and Gupta (2009); Misra, Misra, and Dhariyal (2011a); 2011b); Zhao, Chan, and Ng (2012); Zhao, Chan, Li, and Ng (2013a); 2013b); Laniado and Lillo (2014) and the references therein. In general, there are two types of redundancies called active redundancy and standby redundancy commonly used in reliability engineering and system security. The former [active redundancy] is used when replacement of components during the operation of the system is impossible; in this case the redundancies are put in parallel to components of the system which leads to taking the maximum of random lifetimes. The latter [standby redundancy] is used when replacement of components during the operation of the system is possible; in this case the redundancy starts functioning immediately after the corresponding original component in the system fails which leads to taking the convolution of random variables.It is known that the performance of a coherent system consisting of independent components can be enhanced by putting spares to each of its components or by creating a duplicate system consisting of spares similar to the original coherent system. For example, there is a series system with n components and we have another n components at hand as spares. In order to enhance the lifetime of the original series system, we can assemble these n spares either on component level (Fig. 1(a)) or system level (Fig. 1(b)). Naturally, it is of great interest and importance to make sure which type is superior to the other.To begin, we suppose the general coherent system ϕ consists of n components C1, …, Cnhaving independent lifetimes X1, …, Xn. Denote τ(X) = τ(X1, …, Xn) the lifetime of the coherent system ϕ. Suppose now n standby spares R1, …, Rnhave independent lifetimes Y1, …, Yn, and (X1, …, Xn) and (Y1, …, Yn) are statistically independent. In component redundancy case, we allocate a standby spare Rito the component Ci, i = 1, …, n. Then the resultant coherent system, denoted by TC, has lifetime τ(X + Y) = τ(X1 + Y1, …, Xn+ Yn). In system redundancy case, we duplicate the coherent system ϕ with components C1, …, Cnby R1, …, Rnand make it available as a standby redundant spare to the coherent system ϕ. The resultant coherent system, denoted by TS, has lifetime τ(X) + τ(Y). A well-known principle among design engineers states that redundancy at the component level is always better than at the system level (cf. Barlow and Proschan, 1981). This statement, however, is not true in general for the standby redundancy case though it is for the active redundancy case. Boland and El-Neweihi (1995) concluded that, in the sense of the usual stochastic order, redundancy at component level is better than redundancy at system level for series systems, while the reverse is true for parallel systems, i.e.,(1)∧(X1+Y1,…,Xn+Yn)≥st[∧(X1,…,Xn)]+[∧(Y1,…,Yn)]and(2)∨(X1+Y1,…,Xn+Yn)≤st[∨(X1,…,Xn)]+[∨(Y1,…,Yn)],where the symbols ‘∧’ and ‘∨’ mean min and max, respectively. Boland and El-Neweihi (1995) also showed that, for series systems, if all random lifetimes are exponentially i.i.d., then the usual stochastic order in (1) can be strengthened to the hazard rate order. On the other hand, Meng (1996) proved that (1) holds if and only if the system is series and (2) holds if and only if the system is parallel. What does this suggest about the non-i.i.d. case? Here, we shall present some comparison results in the sense of various stochastic orderings when the original components and spares have independent but nonidentical exponential distributed lifetimes. Specifically, for the standby redundancy of series systems, if either Xi= stYi(i = 1, …, n) or X1 = st… = stXnand Y1 = st… = stYn, it is established that∧(X1+Y1,…,Xn+Yn)≥lr[∧(X1,…,Xn)]+[∧(Y1,…,Yn)].For the standby redundancy of parallel systems, if X1 = stX2 and Y1 = stY2, we establish∨(X1+Y1,X2+Y2)≤lr[∨(X1,X2)]+[∨(Y1,Y2)],and if Xi= stYi(i = 1, 2), we prove∨(X1+Y1,X2+Y2)≤st[∨(X1,X2)]+[∨(Y1,Y2)].Consider a series system with two components and two active spares. In the case of matching spares, i.e., Xi= stYi, i = 1, 2, the redundancy at component level is better in the hazard rate ordering than the redundancy at system level (see Boland and El-Neweihi, 1995). An analogous result was proved for the reversed hazard rate ordering in Gupta and Nanda (2001). Brito, Zequeira, and Valdès (2011) further considered the case of matching spares and gave a sufficient condition under which the likelihood ratio ordering holds. Gupta and Nanda (2001) proved the redundancy at component level is better in the reversed hazard rate ordering than the redundancy at system level in the case of non-matching spares, X1 = stX2 and Y1 = stY2. Boland and El-Neweihi (1995) showed with a counterexample that the hazard rate ordering does not always exist between them. In this regard, Brito, Zequeira, and Valdès (2011) proved that, if the reversed hazard rates of X1 and Y1 are proportional, then the hazard rate ordering holds. Obviously, the exponential case is not satisfied with the proportional condition, and we provide a counterexample to depict the hazard rate ordering does not hold for the exponential case in Section 4(Example 4.1).We next consider the general coherent systems with n components and n active spares. Similar to the standby case, in component redundancy case, the resultant coherent system, denoted by SC, has lifetime τ(X∨Y) = τ(X1∨Y1, …, Xn∨Yn). In system redundancy case, the resultant coherent system, denoted by SS, has lifetime τ(X)∨τ(Y). For general coherent systems, it is well known (cf. Barlow and Proschan, 1981) that the component redundancy is better than system redundancy in the sense of the usual stochastic ordering, i.e.,τ(X∨Y)≥stτ(X)∨τ(Y).It would be very interesting to examine some stronger stochastic orderings. In the case of matching spares, i.e., Xi= stYi, i = 1, …, n, Boland and El-Neweihi (1995) proved, for series systems, that the component redundancy is superior to the system redundancy in the sense of the hazard rate ordering, i.e.,(3)∧(X1∨Y1,…,Xn∨Yn)≥hr[∧(X1,…,Xn)]∨[∧(Y1,…,Yn)].The above result can be readily extended to series–parallel systems (cf. Corollary 1-1 in Boland and El-Neweihi 1995). When all components and spares are i.i.d., they also proved, for general coherent systems, τ(X∨Y) ≥ hrτ(X)∨τ(Y) under some mild conditions. Though this result cannot be applied to the general k-out-of-n system, but they showed the result is true for the special case of 2-out-of-n system and left the general case for an open problem. Gupta and Nanda (2001) obtained a similar result for the reversed hazard rate ordering. In fact, Singh and Singh (1997) have solved the open problem posed by Boland and El-Neweihi (1995) and established a stronger result in the sense of the likelihood ratio ordering for the general k-out-of-n system with all components and spares having i.i.d. absolutely continuous lifetimes. Also, there remains an open problem that whether this result still holds for the case when we just have the condition Xi= stYi, i = 1, …, n (matching case) and such a result for two-component series system has been shown in Brito, Zequeira, and Valdès (2011) wherein they require that the hazard rates are proportional. On the other hand, Misra, Dhariyal, and Gupta (2009) studied the non-matching case and obtained some new results. In this paper, we present a likelihood ratio order result for the series system with n exponential components under the setup of matching case (Theorem 4.2). Specifically, for the active redundancy of series systems, if Xi= stYi(i = 1, …, n), we establish∧(X1∨Y1,…,Xn∨Yn)≥lr[∧(X1,…,Xn)]∨[∧(Y1,…,Yn)].This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall some pertinent notions of stochastic orderings which will be used in the sequel. Section 3 presents some comparison results of series systems and parallel systems in the sense of various stochastic orderings for standby redundancy at component level versus system level. Section 4 carries out stochastic comparisons of series systems between component level and system level in the sense of the likelihood ratio ordering under the setup of matching spares as well as for the non-matching spares: a counterexample is provided to show that there does not exist similar comparison result even for the hazard rate ordering. Conclusion is finally made in Section 5. The technical details of the proofs of all the main results are presented in Appendix  A.Throughout this paper, the term increasing is used for monotone non-decreasing and decreasing is used for monotone non-increasing.Definition 2.1For two random variables X and Y with densities fXand fY, and distribution functions FXand FY, respectively, letF¯X=1−FXandF¯Y=1−FYbe the corresponding survival functions. Then:(i)X is said to be smaller than Y in the likelihood ratio order (denoted by X ≤ lrY) if fY(x)/fX(x) is increasing in x;X is said to be smaller than Y in the hazard rate order (denoted by X ≤ hrY) ifF¯Y(x)/F¯X(x)is increasing in x;X is said to be smaller than Y in the reversed hazard rate order (denoted by X ≤ rhY) if FY(x)/FX(x) is increasing in x;X is said to be smaller than Y in the stochastic order (denoted by X ≤ stY) ifF¯Y(x)≥F¯X(x),∀x.It is known that the likelihood ratio order implies both the hazard rate order and the reversed hazard rate order which in turn implies the usual stochastic order, but neither the hazard rate order nor the reversed hazard rate order order implies the other; see Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007).In this section, we present some comparison results for series systems and parallel systems having standby redundancy at component level versus system level.In the case of series system having matching spares, i.e., Xi= stYi, i = 1, 2, …, n, we have the following result which states that the redundancy at component level is more efficient than the redundancy at system level in the sense of the likelihood ratio order.Theorem 3.1Let X1, …, Xn be independent exponential lifetimes with respective parameters λ1, …, λn, and Y1, ..., Yn be another independent set of exponential lifetimes with respective parameters λ1, …, λn. Then,τ(X+Y)=∧(X1+Y1,…,Xn+Yn)≥lr[∧(X1,…,Xn)]+[∧(Y1,…,Yn)]=τ(X)+τ(Y).Set n = 4, λ1 = 3, λ2 = 5, λ3 = 4, and λ4 = 6 in Theorem 3.1. Fig. 2plots the likelihood ratio functionfTC(x)/fTS(x). It can be seen thatfTC(x)/fTS(x)is increasing in x ∈ ℜ+, which shows the validity of the result in Theorem 3.1.In the case of non-matching spares, we have the following similar result.Theorem 3.3Let X1, …, Xn be independent exponential random lifetimes with common parameter λ1, and Y1, …, Yn be independent exponential random lifetimes with common parameter λ2. Then,τ(X+Y)=∧(X1+Y1,…,Xn+Yn)≥lr[∧(X1,…,Xn)]+[∧(Y1,…,Yn)]=τ(X)+τ(Y).Set n = 5, λ1 = 4 and λ2 = 3 in Theorem 3.3. By the symmetry, we know that it is same as the case λ1 = 3 and λ2 = 4. Fig. 3plots the ratio of the two density functions. It can be seenfTC(x)/fTS(x)is increasing in x ∈ ℜ+, which is in accordance with the theoretical result in Theorem 3.3.We next discuss the case of parallel systems. In this case, due to the extreme complexity of distribution theory, we only deal with the special case when n = 2 and it can be found that the comparison result is reversed compared to the case of series systems. Now, let us first go into the non-matching spares.Theorem 3.5Let X1, X2be independent exponential random lifetimes with common parameter λ1and Y1, Y2be independent exponential random lifetimes with common parameter λ2. Then,τ(X+Y)=∨(X1+Y1,X2+Y2)≤lr[∨(X1,X2)]+[∨(Y1,Y2)]=τ(X)+τ(Y).Under the setup in Theorem 3.5, we consider the likelihood ratiofTS(x)/fTC(x)under the condition λ1 ≥ λ2. Based on this, we suppose that the parameters in (a), (b), (c) and (d) below satisfy the cases λ1 = λ2, λ2 < λ1 < 2λ2, λ1 > 2λ2 and λ1 = 2λ2, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 4that the likelihood ratio functions for all these four cases are increasing, which coincides with the theoretic result in Theorem 3.5.(a)λ1 = 0.6, λ2 = 0.6;λ1 = 3, λ2 = 2;λ1 = 5, λ2 = 0.7;λ1 = 8, λ2 = 4.For the matching spares case, we only have the following comparison result in the sense of the usual stochastic order.Theorem 3.7Let X1, X2be independent exponential lifetimes with respective parameters λ1, λ2, and Y1, Y2be another independent exponential set with respective parameters λ1, λ2. Then,τ(X+Y)=∨(X1+Y1,X2+Y2)≤st[∨(X1,X2)]+[∨(Y1,Y2)]=τ(X)+τ(Y).Set λ1 = 5 and λ2 = 3 in Theorem 3.7. Fig. 5plots the survival functions of TCand TS. It can be seen that the survival function of TSis larger than that of TCfor x ∈ ℜ+, which shows the validity of the result in Theorem 3.7.One may wonder whether the result in Theorem 3.7 can be strengthened to the hazard rate ordering. The following Example 3.9 gives a negative answer to this problem.Example 3.9Denote byhTC(x))=fTC(x)/F¯TC(x)andhTS(x)=fTS(x)/F¯TS(x)the hazard rate functions of TCand TS, respectively. Fig. 6plots the shape ofhTC(x)andhTS(x). It can be observed that we cannot compare these two hazard rate functions in this regard. Consequently, the likelihood ratio order does not hold as well.In this section, we carry out stochastic comparisons of series systems at component level and system level for the matching spares case in the sense of the likelihood ratio order. First we provide a counterexample to show the comparison result does not hold even for the hazard rate order in the non-matching spares case.Example 4.1Set λ1 = 3.5 and λ2 = 2. The survival functions of Q1 = ∧(X1∨Y1, X2∨Y2) and Q2 = ∨(X1∧X2, Y1∧Y2) can be written asF¯Q1(x)=[1−(1−e−3.5x)(1−e−2x)]2andF¯Q2(x)=1−[(1−e−2×3.5x)][(1−e−2×2x)].But, the ratio is not monotone as can be seen in Fig. 7.Now, we are ready to present our main result in the case of matching spares.Theorem 4.2Let X1, …, Xn be independent exponential lifetimes with respective parameters λ1, …, λn, and Y1, ..., Yn be another independent exponential set with respective parameters λ1, …, λn. Then,(4)τ(X∨Y)=∧(X1∨Y1,…,Xn∨Yn)≥lr[∧(X1,…,Xn)]∨[∧(Y1,…,Yn)]=τ(X)∨τ(Y).Set n = 4, λ1 = 2, λ2 = 0.8, λ3 = 1.6 and λ4 = 2.5 in Theorem 4.2. Fig. 8plots the ratio of the two density functions. One can observe thatfSC(x)/fSS(x)is increasing in x ∈ ℜ+, which fits the theoretical result in Theorem 4.2.Let us suppose the general coherent system ϕ consists of n components C1, …, Cnhaving independent lifetimes X1, …, Xn. Denote τ(X) = τ(X1, …, Xn) the lifetime of the coherent system ϕ. Suppose now n standby[active] spares R1, …, Rnhave independent lifetimes Y1, …, Yn, and (X1, …, Xn) and (Y1, …, Yn) are statistically independent. In component redundancy case, we allocate a standby[active] spare Rito the component Ci, i = 1, …, n. Then the resultant coherent system, denoted by TC[SC], has lifetime τ(X + Y) = τ(X1 + Y1, …, Xn+ Yn)[τ(X∨Y) = τ(X1∨Y1, …, Xn∨Yn)]. In system redundancy case, we duplicate the coherent system ϕ with components C1, …, Cnby R1, …, Rnand make it available as a standby[active] redundant spare to the coherent system ϕ. The resultant coherent system, denoted by TS[SS], has lifetime τ(X) + τ(Y)[τ(X)∨τ(Y)].Let X1, …, Xnbe independent exponential lifetimes with respective parameters λ1, …, λn, and Y1, ..., Ynbe another independent exponential set with respective parameters λ1, …, λn. In this article, for the standby redundancy of series systems, it is established thatτ(X+Y)=∧(X1+Y1,…,Xn+Yn)≥lr[∧(X1,…,Xn)]+[∧(Y1,…,Yn)]=τ(X)+τ(Y)and for the standby redundancy of parallel systems, we establishτ(X+Y)=∨(X1+Y1,X2+Y2)≤st[∨(X1,X2)]+[∨(Y1,Y2)]=τ(X)+τ(Y).For the active redundancy of series systems, we haveτ(X∨Y)=∧(X1∨Y1,…,Xn∨Yn)≥lr[∧(X1,…,Xn)]∨[∧(Y1,…,Yn)]=τ(X)∨τ(Y).Let W1, …, Wnbe independent exponential lifetimes with common parameter λ1, and V1, ..., Vnbe another set of independent exponential lifetimes with common parameter λ2. For the standby redundancy of series systems, it is established thatτ(W+V)=∧(W1+V1,…,Wn+Vn)≥lr[∧(W1,…,Wn)]+[∧(V1,…,Vn)]=τ(W)+τ(V)and for the standby redundancy of parallel systems, we establishτ(W+V)=∨(W1+V1,W2+V2)≤lr[∨(W1,W2)]+[∨(V1,V2)]=τ(W)+τ(V).For the active redundancy of series systems, we can conclude that the comparison result does not hold even for the hazard rate order by a counterexample.
