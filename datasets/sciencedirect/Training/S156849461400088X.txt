@&#ABSTRACT@&#
It is undeniably crucial for a firm to be able to make a forecast regarding the sales volume of new products. However, the current economic environments invariably have uncertain factors and rapid fluctuations where decision makers must draw conclusions from minimal data. Previous studies combine scenario analysis and technology substitution models to forecast the market share of multigenerational technologies. However, a technology substitution model based on a logistic curve will not always fit the S curve well. Therefore, based on historical data and the data forecast by both the Scenario and Delphi methods, a two stage fuzzy piecewise logistic growth model with multiple objective programming is proposed herein. The piecewise concept is adopted in order to reflect the market impact of a new product such that it can be possible to determine the effective length of sales forecasting intervals even when handling a large variation in data or small size data. In order to demonstrate the model's performance, two cases in the Television and Telecommunication industries are treated using the proposed method and the technology substitution model or the Norton and Bass diffusion model. A comparison of the results shows that the proposed model outperforms the technology substitution model and the Norton and Bass diffusion model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The replacement of an older generation of technological products with newer ones is common in the high-technology sector. To better understand and describe this phenomenon, Fisher and Pry [1] proposed the technological substitution model in 1971 which analyzes the penetration process of new-generation technologies replacing old ones. Marchetti and Nakicenovic [2] expanded upon this model [1] to deal with multi-generation and multi-product conditions. A more comprehensive description of the model and its assumptions has been given by Nakicenovic [3]. Notably, these substitution models are market share models which assume that there is a market there to be substituted. From the innovation diffusion perspective, Norton and Bass [4] developed a multi-generation diffusion model which has the ability to estimate or forecast market potential and has become a popular forecasting method in the field.A key proposal of Marchetti and Nakicenovic [2] was that the life cycle of every technology includes three phases: growth, saturation and decline. During the growth phase of a new technology, substitution proceeds logistically. Finally, the technology enters the decline phase and degenerates logistically. However, in the current competitive environment, it is hard for the product life cycle to be represented by a smooth S curve or fitted logistic curve [5,6]. Tseng et al. [5], proposed three scenarios, the optimistic, pessimistic and most possible scenarios, for the development of organic light-emitting diode (OLED), a television (TV) technology with no sales data. Then, they applied the Marchetti and Nakicenovic [2] technological substitution model, in which the diffusion curves of all technologies are supposed to be logistic, to forecast the market share of the color cathode ray tube (CRT), rear projection (RP), plasma display panel (PDP), liquid crystal display (LCD) and OLED TVs. They found that the diffusion curve of the PDP TV was not a logistic curve, but an S curve, which is unable to meet the assumptions of Marchetti and Nakicenovic's technological substitution model [2] and the forecasting performance was not very good (Please refer to the MAPE of PDP TV in Table 2). Therefore, one of the research gaps exists insofar as the conventional technological substitution model was hard to deploy logistically.In addition to the diffusion curve issue as regards new products, the other research gap was such that the analysis of uncertainty in the environment also requires consideration [7,8]. To handle the uncertainty issue, two different perspectives are addressed. Tanaka et al. [9] developed fuzzy regression with symmetrical triangular fuzzy parameters via a possibility distribution to provide possibility forecasting intervals to decision makers. However, the conventional fuzzy regression model is sensitive to outliers, i.e. the more the various data fluctuate, the wider the forecast intervals, a situation which then causes difficulties with regards to interpretation [10]. In order to cope with large variations in data, Yu et al. [11] proposed the fuzzy piecewise regression model which behaves differently in different parts of the range of crisp input variables. Huang and Tzeng [12] applied this model to their two-stage fuzzy piecewise regression analysis to better grasp the dynamics of a nonlinear time-series within a fuzzy environment. Their objective was to forecast product life time (PLT) and the annual shipment of products during the entire PLT of multiple generation products. However, the number of change-points could not be generated automatically. So, Yu and Tzeng [13] extended the fuzzy piecewise regression model to overcome this limitation. Based on the current research gap, we propose a fuzzy piecewise logistic growth model which combines the advantages of a piecewise regression model and the logistic diffusion model so as to deal with complex growth for single- or multiple-generation(s) product sales forecasting [14]. This model can solve the problem that arises when the time series shows an S curve but not a logistic curve and can be applied to multiple-generation diffusion forecasting.Scenario analysis, another perspective to deal with uncertainty, is an important forecasting method used since the 1960s to forecast and understand future developments. The approach outlines some aspects of the future world by telling stories to emphasize dimensions of today's world under uncertainties [15]. Thus, Scenario analysis presents rich and complex portraits of possible future scenarios; however, it fails to provide quantifiable forecasts [16]. Therefore, Wang and Lan [17] combined Scenario analysis (which addresses an uncertain future) and the technological substitution model (a quantitative method) to analyze the development of new-generation technologies. The limitation of their approach, which pertains to Scenario analysis, is such that scenarios are commonly constructed on the basis of expert opinion and often there are large differences among these opinions.To deal with this diversity, the Delphi technique was developed to obtain the most reliable consensus within a group of experts by using a series of intensive questionnaires interspersed with controlled opinion feedback [18]. Subsequently, some research has combined Scenario analysis and Delphi method to generate future scenarios [19–24]. However, these scenarios are still unable to provide clear quantified information such as the forecast market share of the new technology. Therefore, Tseng et al. [5] combined Scenario analysis with the technological substitution model and the Delphi method, which is a kind of interpolation technique used to analyze the development of a new technology, namely, the latest-generation TV, or the OLED TV. Additionally, they request that the experts forecast the market share to solve the problem of limited data as regards new technology. However, their technology substitution model based on a logistic curve will not always fit the S curve well.As such, there are two research gaps: the technological substitution model needs to be a logistic curve and the newest technology has limited data; the future brings uncertainty and sales forecasting need to consider more scenarios. Therefore, this work aims to integrate the advantages of Scenario analysis and the Delphi method with the new proposed fuzzy piecewise logistic model to analyze the development of the latest-generation technology. In order to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed model, we applied it to Tseng et al.’s two cases [5,25] and adopted the data from the Scenario analysis and the Delphi method in Tseng et al.’s work. In the first case, the proposed method forecasts the futures of CRT, RP, PDP, LCD and OLED TVs over the next ten years. In the second case, the market shares of second generation (2G) mobile, third generation (3G) mobile, Microwave Access (WiMAX) and long-term evolution (LTE) over the next ten years are forecast.The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a fuzzy piecewise logistic regression model. Section 3 describes the proposed methodology. Section 4 presents two empirical cases. Section 5 concludes.The fuzzy piecewise logistic growth model obtains the smallest interval forecast which includes all of the raw data to compensate for the weakness of the Norton and Bass model [4]. Therefore, it can provide a possible interval and is a viable alternative to the forecast for multiple-generations. Moreover, it can detect the change points in a complex growth process.Based on the fuzzy piecewise regression model [11], an initial fuzzy piecewise logistic regression model is described as follows:(1)πˆt=1/(1+exp(−A1t+A0+∑s=1n−1Bs(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2))whereπˆtis the forecast market share; A0, A1 and Bsfor s=1,…, n−1 are fuzzy coefficients; h is cut level; andπˆtand πtare forecast fuzzy output and raw data, respectively, i.e.,πt⊆πˆt. The upper bounds and lower bounds of the piecewise logistic diffusion model are presented below, respectively:(2)πˆtU=1/(1+exp(−a1ct+a0c+∑s=1n−1bsc(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2−(1−h)(a1wt+a0w+∑i=1n−1bsw(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2))(3)πˆtL=1/(1+exp(−a1ct+a0c+∑s=1n−1bsc(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2+(1−h)(a1wt+a0w+∑s=1n−1bsw(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2))The inclusion relationships among the upper and lower bounds of the piecewise logistic diffusion model and the raw data are as follows:(4)πˆtL⊆πt⊆πˆtUAfter taking logarithms, the fuzzy piecewise logistic growth model is transformed into a piecewise linear model which meets the requirements of the inclusion relationship, according to which the fuzzy regression must include the observations, i.e.,YˆtL⊆Yt⊆YˆtU:(5)YˆtL=ln1−πˆtUπˆtU=−a1ct+a0c+∑s=1n−1bsc(t−ps+t−ps)/2−(1−h)(a1wt+a0w+∑i=1n−1bsw(t−ps+t−ps)/2)(6)YˆtU=ln1−πˆtLπˆtL=−a1ct+a0c+∑s=1n−1bsc(t−ps+t−ps)/2+(1−h)(a1wt+a0w+∑i=1n−1bsw(t−ps+t−ps)/2)(7)[a0c−a1ct+∑s=1n−1bsc(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2]−(1−h)[a0w+a1w|t|+∑s=1n−1bsw(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2]≤Yj−(1−h)ej(8)[a0c−a1ct+∑s=1n−1bsc(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2]+(1−h)[a0w+a1w|t|+∑s=1n−1bsw(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2]≥Yj+(1−h)ejIn addition to minimizing the fuzziness width of the fuzzy regression model, this study also considers the objective of minimizing the number of change points in the piecewise regression model. The first objective, z1, is to minimize the fuzziness width and the second objective, z2, is to minimize the number of change points by using linear mixed integer programming to obtain possibility models. The membership functions for the two minimizing objectives are defined below:(9)μ(z1)1z1−−z1z1−−z1*(10)μ(z2)2z2−−z2z2−−z2*wherez1*,z2*andz1−,z2−are the ideal and anti-ideal solutions of the problem. Thez1*,z2*are set to zero and thez1−,z2−are set to be n, respectively. Then, to obtain the optimal degree of overall satisfaction between goals, the study uses the noncompensatory operator min, i.e., λ=min(μ1(z1), μ2(z2)) [13]. Following this, a compromised solution from these two minimizing objectives is generated, using multiple objective programming, in order to obtain a parsimonious model with an appropriate number of change points:MaxλSubjectto(11)λ≤(z1−−z1)/(z1−−z1*)(12)λ≤(z2−−z2)/(z2−−z2*)(13)z1=a0w+a1w+∑s=1n−1bsw(14)[a0c−a1ct+∑s=1n−1bsc(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2]−(1−h)[a0w+a1w|t|+∑s=1n−1bsw(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2≤Yj−(1−h)ej(15)[a0c−a1ct+∑s=1n−1bsc(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2]+(1−h)[a0w+a1w|t|+∑s=1n−1bsw(|t−ps|+t−ps)/2≥Yj+(1−h)ej(16)bsc<Mus−2δvs+δ+φvs(17)bsc>2δus−Mvs−δ−φus(18)us+vs≤Is(19)∑s=1n−1Is=z2(20)bsw≤MIs,s=1,2,…,n−1andj=1,2,…,n.Constraints (14) and (15) represent the inclusion relationshipYˆtL⊆Yt⊆YˆtU. Constraints (16)–(20) are checked to see whether they satisfy the definition of a change point in their model. Ifbsc≥δ, i.e., a change point occurs in the sth position, then us+vs=Is=1; otherwise, us+vs=Is=0. For the sake of simplicity, h is set to zero, which means the value of the dependent variable is crisp instead of an interval. Let the parameters M=1000, δ=0.000000001 and φ=0.0000000001 for solving this program using LINGO optimization software. Based on piecewise characteristics, the methodology is insensitive to larger variations in the data. A compromised solution, with the minimal fuzziness width and the minimal number of change-points, can be found automatically. The detected change-points or their neighborhood can be viewed, under some circumstances, as outliers or technology changes in the market.In this model, the two objectives of achieving the minimal fuzziness width and the minimal number of change-points have the same priority. However, from the forecasting perspective, the first objective of minimizing the forecast width is more important than the second objective of minimizing the number of change points. Additionally, the fuzzy piecewise regression is feasible only in an inner range of forecast, not an out of range forecast. Therefore, this study incorporates the Delphi method and considers all generations at the same time. The proposed two stage method extends the fuzzy piecewise logistic growth model designed for forecasting in the future.Yokum and Armstrong [26] conducted an expert opinion survey to determine the evaluation criteria for selecting forecasting techniques. Without a doubt, accuracy is the most important criterion. The next most important consideration involves the cost savings generated from improved decisions. In this study, three popular criteria of forecasting accuracy are used to make comparisons of the forecasting capabilities of different models [26–29] and are illustrated below.The first measurement is the Mean Square Error (MSE):(21)MSE=∑t=1n(πt−πˆt)2/nwhereπˆtis the forecast value at time t, πtis the actual value at time t and n is the number of forecasts. The second criterion is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE):(22)MAE=∑t=1nπt−πˆt/nThe third criterion is the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE):(23)MAPE=1n∑t=1n|πt−πˆt|/πtThe above three accuracy measures are used to compare the proposed method with the technological substitution model and Norton and Bass multigenerational diffusion model [5,25], respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A technology substitution model based on a logistic curve will not always fit the S curve well. Therefore, we propose a two-stage fuzzy piecewise logistic growth model, which is adopted in order to understand the market impact of a new product such that it will be possible to determine the effective length of sales forecasting intervals even when handling large variations in data.Additionally, when a new high technology goes to the market, understanding the diffusion trend is a key factor for decision making. However, most of the time, there is no historical data or there is only limited data. Therefore, this research used Tseng et al.’s concept [5,25] and combined the advantages of qualitative and quantitative forecasting methods. Scenario analysis and the Delphi method were employed to portray the future scenarios of the OLED TV and LTE, which are new technologies with almost no historical data and then used the proposed method to forecast the market shares for this new technology over a multi-generation period and in three different scenarios. Compared with the results of Tseng et al. [5,25], the results show that the proposed model obtains the smallest interval forecast for all the selected data which indicates that it can provide an effective possible forecasting interval and obtain the best, worst and possible market shares. In addition, in order to demonstrate the performance of the two-stage fuzzy piecewise logistic model, this work used MAE, MSE and MAPE to compare the central value of the proposed model and the technology substitution model for TVs and the Norton and Bass multi-generation diffusion model for telecommunications technologies. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional models in each of the three scenarios, demonstrating the ability of the proposed method to handle smaller data sample sizes and deal with the notion that the S curve is not logistic in an uncertain environment. Fuzzy piecewise logistic regression is not only used in forecasting but also to explore the events of change points. Following this, future work can focus on discussing change points and determine what kind of events can affect the sales volume increases or decreases as well as the strength of the events. Additionally, the experts’ estimations will affect our results; the question of how to collect the experts’ forecasts regarding the three scenarios is another issue to explore and expand upon.
