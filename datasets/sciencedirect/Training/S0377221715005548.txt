@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The investigated problem is the analysis of customers’ strategic behavior in a single server Markovian M2/M/1 queue with batch arrivals of two customers with a reward-cost structure. At their arrival time, customers can decide to join the queue or to balk. The utility of each one depends on his decision, on his partner’s decision and on the system state. Two cases are considered: when the system provides the information about its state (observable case), and when this information is not provided (unobservable case). Both problems are modeled as games in extensive form with complete and imperfect information. We give the Nash equilibria for each corresponding game and we compare between both cases in order to determine the policy which arranges the system’s manager.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The study of queueing systems from an economic viewpoint has become a very active area of research during recent decades. More specifically, some reward-cost structure is imposed on queueing systems, reflecting customers’ desire for service and their dislike for waiting. Thus, the customer is not an exogenous factor to the system. This brings us to take into account the customers’ strategic behavior in the analysis of queueing systems. For example, a customer can decide whether to join the queue or to balk, to purchase priority or not, in order to maximize his utility, given that other customers have the same objective. A customer’s decision affects the decisions of other customers. On the other hand, the decision also depends on customers’ information (available or not) about the system state. There are generally two scenarios:•Customers are informed about the system state upon their arrival, then we talk about the observable case.Upon their arrival, customers are not informed about the system state and make their decisions based on their belief about the queue length, then we talk about the unobservable case.The study of customers’ behavior in queueing systems was initiated by Naor (1969), who considered an observable M/M/1 queue with a reward-cost structure in which customers decide, at their arrival times, to join the queue or to balk. Edelson and Hildebrand (1975) considered the same queue in the unobservable case, and showed that the profit maximizing fee coincides with the social welfare maximizing fee. Subsequently, many studies have emerged, considering other models of queueing systems. See for example Burnetas and Economou (2007) (queue with setup time), Economou and Kanta (2008) (queue with compartmented waiting space), Boudali and Economou (2012) (queue with catastrophes), Guo and Hassin (2011, 2012) (vacation queue with homogeneous and heterogeneous customers), Dimitrakopoulos and Burnetas (2011) (queue with dynamic service control). In Hassin and Haviv (2003), we can find several results about customers behavior in different queueing systems. The aim of these works is usually to determine the best customers’ decisions and to maximize the social benefit (public welfare) and the server’s revenue.Some works analyzed the information and uncertainty in queueing systems. Hassin (2007) studied the information effect and the uncertainty on customers’ benefit in the unobservable case, assuming that some parameters are known to the server and not to customers. Debo and Veeraraghavan (2013) considered an observable queue in which the server works alternatively with two levels of service, more precisely with fast or slow rate. Customers make their decisions without knowing neither the rate nor the value of service.Veltman and Hassin (2005) studied an unobservable queue and treated the decisions of customers and servers under various price structures, where customers must obtain two services. This work was generalized by Sun, Li, Tian, and Zhang (2009), who considered an unobservable batch arrivals queue with two complementary services.Örmeci and Burnetas (2004) considered the problem of admission control in a multi-class Markovian loss system (without waiting room) with batch arrivals and some identical parallel servers. The same authors Örmeci and Burnetas (2005) studied a similar problem with two-class of batches and different service rate for each class. Çil, Örmeci, and Karaesmen (2007) studied also the admission control problem in a multi-class batch arrivals queue with finite buffer capacity. These problems are formulated using Markov decision process. In these models, the decision maker is only the system’s controller who decides to admit or reject the arriving customers. Thus, he can employ either batch acceptance policy in which he accepts or rejects the whole batch, or partial acceptance policy where he accepts only some of them. Note that customers don’t make any decision; their entrance to the system is controlled in the objective of maximizing the system’s benefit.Yildirim and Hasenbein (2010) considered the problem of admission control in an observable batch arrivals queue where customers of a same batch act as one entity in which the controller charges a different price (the highest possible to maximize his revenue) for different batches. To formulate this situation mathematically, the authors used the Markov decision process approach, while Stein, Rapoport, Seale, Zhang, and Zwick (2007) made an experimental study in a queue with batch services and finite calling population.Within the framework of comparison, Hassin (1986) established relations about the firm’s expected revenue and the expected social welfare in the observable and unobservable M/M/1 queues, and made comparisons between these utilities. While Shone, Knight, and Williams (2013) made comparisons between the observable and unobservable M/M/1 systems in the two types of optimization problems (individual and social), and determined the conditions of equality between some characteristics of both models such as: the joining rates, the mean busy periods and the mean number of customers in the system.In this paper, we study the customers’ strategic behavior in a single server Markovian M2/M/1 queue with batch arrivals of two customers and reward-cost structure. To do so, we propose an approach by game theory. Each customer makes a decision to join the queue or to balk depending on the decision of the customer arrived with him and on the system state. Thus, we model the situation by a game at each arrival time in both cases (observable and unobservable) and solve the corresponding game by determining the associated Nash equilibria. Finally, we make numerical comparisons between the two cases in order to determine the best policy that suits the system’s manager or the server and which allows him to realize more important benefits.We consider a Markovian M2/M/1 queue where customers arrive in batches of two according to a Poisson process with rate λ. The service time is exponentially distributed with mean 1/μ. Denote byρ=2λ/μand assume that:•the queue capacity is infinite;the service is performed according to the FIFO policy;service times and inter-arrival times are mutually independent.When two customers of a same batch join the system, they will be placed in the queue randomly; each one may be served before the other one (the ranking in the queue) with probability 1/2. Customers of a same batch make their decisions to join the queue or to balk simultaneously.Assume that R ≥ 3C/2μ. This condition ensures that the reward for service exceeds the expected cost for customers who find the system empty. In other words, when two customers arrive and find the system empty, they will have a positive payoff by joining the queue. However, the decision taken upon arrival is irrevocable.Customers are assumed identical and make their decisions in order to maximize their utilities. We treat the two cases, observable and unobservable, according to the information about the system state.Customers are informed about the system state N(t) at their arrival time t, i.e. they know the number of customers in the system at that time.Let’s suppose that two customers arrive to the system which informs them thatN(t)=n. The two customers have to make simultaneously their decisions: to enter (action E) or to balk (action B). So, if both customers decide to enter, each one receives a payoffR−C(n+1)μwith probability 1/2 (if he is served first) and receivesR−C(n+2)μwith probability 1/2 (otherwise). Then, the expected payoff of each one by joining the queue is:(1)Ui(E,E,n)=R−C(n+1μ12+n+2μ12)=R−C2n+32μ.Let:si={1ifcustomerichoosesactionE,0ifcustomerichoosesactionB.The utility function of each customer can be written as follows:(2)Ui(si,sj,n)=(R−C2n+1+s1+s22μ)si,∀i,j∈{1,2},i≠j.We summarize in the matrix A, called payments matrix, the payoffs associated with different decision choices of both customers, given as follows:Thus, the interactions between both customers of a batch, presented to the system which gives them the informationN(t)=n,can be modeled as a two-person nonzero-sum finite game with complete and imperfect information, withS1=S2={E,B}- the actions set of both players.The extensive form of the game modeling “the intervention” of the system at the first level and the interactions occurring between both players is given in Fig. 1, whereηnimeans that the player i is informed that there are n customers in the system.The customer’s objective is to maximize his utility, so he decides to join the queue if he gets a positive payoff. Suppose moreover that he prefers to join it even if he gets a payoff equal to zero, which reflects his desire to be served. The notations of Basar and Olsder (1982) for dynamic games in extensive form will be used:•η1 (respectively η2)- the information set of player 1 (respectively player 2);N1 (respectively N2)- the class of all information sets of player 1 (respectively player 2);Sη11(respectivelySη22)- the set of actions of player 1 (respectively player 2) at the nodes belonging to the information set η1 (respectively η2);Yη1the set of all probability distributions onSη11;Zη2the set of all probability distributions onSη22;Y=⋃η1∈N1Yη1,Z=⋃η2∈N2Zη2;A behavioral strategyγ^1(respectivelyγ^2) for player 1 (respectively player 2) is a mappingγ^1(.):N1→Y(respectivelyγ^2(.):N2→Z) from the class N1 (respectively N2) of all his information set into Y (respectively Z) assigning one element in Y (respectively Z) for each set in N1 (respectively N2), such thatγ^1(η1)∈Yη1,∀η1 ∈ N1 (respectivelyγ^2(η2)∈Zη2,∀η2 ∈ N2);Γi^the set of behavioral strategies of player i, i ∈ {1, 2}.A pair of strategies(γ^1*,γ^2*)∈Γ1^×Γ2^is said to be a Nash equilibrium in the space of behavioral strategies for a nonzero-sum game in extensive form of Fig. 1, if the following set of inequalities are satisfied:U1^(γ^1*,γ^2*,n)≥U1^(γ^1,γ^2*,n),∀γ^1∈Γ^1,U2^(γ^1*,γ^2*,n)≥U2^(γ^1*,γ^2,n),∀γ^2∈Γ^2,whereUi^(γ^1,γ^2)denotes the average payoff of player i ∈ {1, 2} resulting from the pair of behavioral strategies(γ^1,γ^2)in which the values can be deduced from (2).Let x be a nonnegative real number. Denote by ⌊x⌋ and {x} the integer part and the fractional part of x respectively.We formulate below the different Nash equilibria in behavioral strategies for the game in extensive form depicted in Fig. 1.Theorem 1In the observable M2/M/1 queue, there exists a thresholdne=⌊RμC−32⌋,such that the game in extensive form ofFig. 1admits three Nash equilibria in the spaceΓ1^×Γ2^of behavioral strategies:Equilibrium 1:(γ^11*(η1),γ^12*(η2))∈Γ1^×Γ2^defined by:γ^11*(η1)={Eif(η1=ηk1,0≤k≤ne)or(η1=ηk1,k=ne+1and{μRC}<12);Botherwise.γ^12*(η2)={Eifη2=ηk2,0≤k≤ne;Botherwise.Equilibrium 2:(γ^21*(η1),γ^22*(η2))∈Γ1^×Γ2^defined by:γ^21*(η1)={Eifη1=ηk1,0≤k≤ne;Botherwise.γ^22*(η2)={Eif(η2=ηk2,0≤k≤ne)or(η2=ηk2,k=ne+1and{μRC}<12);Botherwise.Equilibrium 3:(γ^31*(η1),γ^32*(η2))∈Γ1^×Γ2^defined by:γ^31*(η1)={Eifη1=ηk1,0≤k≤ne;{Ewithp=pe=2Rμ−C(2ne+4)Cifη1=ηk1,k=ne+1and{μRC}<12;Bwithp=1−peBotherwise.γ^32*(η2)={Eifη2=ηk2,0≤k≤ne;{Ewithq=pe=2Rμ−C(2ne+4)Cifη2=ηk2,k=ne+1and{μRC}<12;Bwithq=1−peBotherwise;where p (respectively q) is the probability that customer 1 (respectively customer 2) plays the strategy E.First, look at the cases in which both customers receive positive payoff by joining the queue:∀i∈{1,2},Ui(E,E,n)≥0⇔R−C2n+32μ≥0⇔n≤2μR−3C2C.Since n takes only integer values, thenUi(E,E,n)≥0⇔n≤⌊μRC−32⌋.Putne=⌊μRC−32⌋.Now, look at the cases where a customer payoff is positive when he joins the queue alone:U1(E,B,n)=U2(B,E,n)≥0⇔R−Cn+1μ≥0⇔n≤μRC−1.Since n takes only integer values, thenU1(E,B,n)≥0⇔n≤⌊μRC−1⌋.We note that when the fractional part{μRC}≥12,then⌊μRC−1⌋=ne. Otherwise,⌊μRC−1⌋=ne+1.Consider the arrival of two customers when the system state isN(t)=n. We can distinguish three possible cases:Case 1.n ≤ ne.Note that∀γ^1=(p,1−p)∈Γ1^and∀γ^2=(q,1−q)∈Γ2^,(p, q) ∈ [0, 1[2, we will haveU1^(γ1^,E,n)=U1(E,E,n)p+U1(B,E,n)(1−p)=(R−C2n+32μ)p. So,U1(E,E,n)≥U1^(γ^1,E,n). Similarly, we obtainU2(E,E,n)≥U2^(E,γ^2,n). We deduce that the pair of strategies(γ^1*(η1),γ^2*(η2))=(E,E)satisfies the Nash equilibrium conditions in the space of behavioral strategies.Case 2.n=ne+1and{μRC}<12.In this case,U1(E,B,ne+1)=R−Cne+2μ≥0andU1(B,B,ne+1)=0. Then,∀γ^1=(p,1−p)∈Γ1^,p ∈ [0, 1[,U1^(γ^1,B,ne+1)=(R−Cne+2μ)p≤U1(E,B,ne+1). On the other hand,U2(E,E,ne+1)=R−C2ne+52μ<0and∀γ^2=(q,1−q)∈Γ2^,q ∈ ]0, 1],U2^(E,γ^2,ne+1)=(R−C2ne+52μ)q<0. Then,U2(E,B,ne+1)≥U2^(E,γ^2,ne+1). Therefore,(γ^1*(η1),γ^2*(η2))=(E,B)satisfies the Nash equilibrium conditions in the space of behavioral strategies. Similarly, we obtain by symmetry(γ^1*(η1),γ^2*(η2))=(B,E)which also fulfills the conditions of Nash equilibrium in the space of behavioral strategies.Now, we show that(γ^1*,γ^2*)=((p*,1−p*),(q*,1−q*))∈Γ1^×Γ2^forms a Nash equilibrium forp*=q*=pe=2Rμ−C(2ne+4)C.Let A1 and A2 be the payoff matrix of player 1 and player 2 respectively, where:We have:U1^(γ^1*,γ^2*,ne+1)=(γ^1*)tA1γ^2*=(R−Cne+2+12q*μ)p*=0and∀γ^1=(p,1−p)∈Γ^1,U1^(γ^1,γ^2*,ne+1)=(R−Cne+2+12q*μ)p=0. Therefore,U1^(γ^1*,γ^2*,ne+1)≥U1^(γ^1,γ^2*,ne+1).U2^(γ^1*,γ^2*,ne+1)=(γ^1*)tA2γ^2*=(R−Cne+2+12p*μ)q*=0and∀γ^2=(q,1−q)∈Γ^2,U2^(γ^1*,γ^2,ne+1)=(R−Cne+2+12p*μ)q=0. Consequently, ((γ^1*(η1),γ^2*(η2)))=((pe,1−pe),(pe,1−pe)) is a Nash equilibrium in the space of behavioral strategies.Case 3. Look at now to the cases in whichn>ne+1or (n=ne+1and{μRC}≥12).In these cases, ∀i ∈ {1, 2}, Ui(E, E, n) < 0, andU1(E,B,n)=U2(B,E,n)=R−Cn+1μ<0. Then,∀γ^1=(p,1−p)∈Γ1^and∀γ^2=(q,1−q)∈Γ2^,(p, q) ∈ ]0, 1]2,U1^(γ^1,B,n)=(R−Cn+1μ)p<U1(B,B,n)=0andU2^(B,γ^2,n)<U2(B,B,n). Thus,(γ^1*(η1),γ^2*(η2))=(B,B)satisfies the Nash equilibrium conditions in the space of behavioral strategies.□Here, we illustrate the two cases in which{μRC}≥12and{μRC}<12given respectively by (a) and (b) in Fig. 2, representing the customer 1’s payoff function of n (by symmetry, we obtain the same results for customer 2) for fixed values of R, C and μ. Look at customer 1’s payoff when he joins the queue alone (U1(E, B, n)) and when both customers join it together (U1(E, E, n)). In Case (a), this customer is not interested by joining the queue as soon as n > ne(ne=6) because: ∀n > ne, U1(E, ., n) < 0.In Case (b), customer 1’s payoff, when both customers join the queue (U1(E, E, n)), is positive until the valuene=6. From there on, his utility function is negative when both customers enter together. However, if customer 1 joins the queue alone whenn=ne+1,then he gets a nonnegative payoff. That isU1(E,B,ne+1)≥0.Note that, in order not to differentiate between customers, we will explore the symmetric equilibrium (the third equilibrium mentioned in Theorem 1). When all customers use this behavior, we will have the two transition diagrams given by Figs. 3and 4corresponding to the cases{μRC}≥12and{μRC}<12respectively.Proposition 1In the observable M2/M/1 queue, where customers follow the symmetric equilibrium given by Theorem1(Equilibrium 3), the stationary distribution is given as follows:Case 1.When{μRC}≥12.a.Ifne=0,then:P0=11+2λμ,P1=P2=λμP0.If ne≠ 0, then:(3)P0=μ2λ1+μ2λ+∑n=2ne∑i=0[n2]−1Cn−i−2i(λμ)n−i−1+λμ(1+∑n=2ne∑i=0[n+12]−1Cn−i−1i(λμ)n−i−1),(4)P1=12(1+μ2λ+∑n=2ne∑i=0[n2]−1Cn−i−2i(λμ)n−i−1+λμ(1+∑n=2ne∑i=0[n+12]−1Cn−i−1i(λμ)n−i−1)),(5)Pn=∑i=0[n2]−1Cn−i−2i(λμ)n−i−1P0+∑i=0[n+12]−1Cn−i−1i(λμ)n−i−1P1,n=2,ne+1¯,(6)Pne+2=1−μ(1−P0)2λ−Pne+1,with2λ<μ1−(Pne+1+Pne+2).Case 2.When{μRC}<12.a.Ifne=0,then:P0=μ2λ1+μ2λ+peλμ,P1=λμP0,P2=((2pe−pe2)λ2μ2+λμ)P0,P3=pe2λ2μ2P0.If ne≠ 0, then:(7)P0=μ2λ1+μ2λ+∑n=2ne+1∑i=0[n2]−1Cn−i−2i(λμ)n−i−1+(pe−1)∑i=0[ne+12]−1Cne−i−1i(λμ)ne−i+a,wherea=λμ(1+∑n=2ne+1∑i=0[n+12]−1Cn−i−1i(λμ)n−i−1+(pe−1)∑i=0[ne+22]−1Cne−ii(λμ)ne−i).(8)P1=12(1+μ2λ+∑n=2ne+1∑i=0[n2]−1Cn−i−2i(λμ)n−i−1+(pe−1)∑i=0[ne+12]−1Cne−i−1i(λμ)ne−i+b),whereb=λμ(1+∑n=2ne+1∑i=0[n+12]−1Cn−i−1i(λμ)n−i−1+(pe−1)∑i=0[ne+22]−1Cne−ii(λμ)ne−i).(9)Pn=∑i=0[n2]−1Cn−i−2i(λμ)n−i−1P0+∑i=0[n+12]−1Cn−i−1i(λμ)n−i−1P1,n=2,ne+1¯,(10)Pne+2=(pe(2−pe)λ+μ)Pne+1−λPne−1μ,(11)Pne+3=pe2λμPne+1,with2λ<μ1−((1−pe)Pne+1+Pne+2+Pne+3).The detailed proof is given in the appendix.The probability that a customer balks is equal toPne+1+Pne+2in the case where{μRC}≥12,and is equal to(1−pe)Pne+1+Pne+2+Pne+3otherwise.The joining rate is given by:(12)λeobs={2λ(1−Pne+1−Pne+2)if{μRC}≥12,2λ(1−(1−pe)Pne+1−Pne+2−Pne+3)otherwise.In this case, the expression of the social benefit per time unit is:(13)Usobs={2Rλ(1−Pne+1−Pne+2)−C∑n=0ne+2nPnif{μRC}≥12,2Rλ(1−(1−pe)Pne+1−Pne+2−Pne+3)otherwise.−C∑n=0ne+3nPnIn this section, we study the customers’ behavior who come in batches of two to the system which does not provide the information about its state N(t). In this case, all customers are in the same level of information and since they are all identical (symmetrical), we assume that they join the system with the same probability p satisfying some conditions that we will set later.Following this assumption, we first determine the characteristics of this system which will be useful for determining the customers’ utility function.The transition diagram representing the system is given by Fig. 5.The study of this system’s characteristics turns to study the characteristics of an MX/M/1 queue, where X is a binomial random variable with parameters (2, p). The associated balance equations for the stationary distribution of the Markov chain {N(t), t ≥ 0} are given as follows:(14)(p2λ+2p(1−p)λ)P0=μP1⇔λp(2−p)p0=μP1,(15)(p(2−p)λ+μ)P1=2p(1−p)λP0+μP2,(16)(p(2−p)λ+μ)Pn=μPn+1+λp2Pn−2+λ2p(1−p)Pn−1,n≥2.Under the stability condition 2pλ < μ, we obtain the following characteristics (see Medhi, 1991):P0=1−2λpμ,P1=λp(2−p)μP0,N¯=pλ(p+2)μ−2pλ,T¯s=p+22(μ−2pλ).The other stationary probabilities can be recursively obtained from Eqs. (15) and (16).At each arrival time t, customers are not informed about the system state N(t) and have to make simultaneously their decisions: to enter (action E) or to balk (action B). Since both customers join the queue with the same probability p, it means that they use the same mixed strategyα=(p,1−p). That is,∀i∈{1,2}:αi=(pi,1−pi)=α,where αiis the mixed strategy of customer i. We know also that the utility of customer i, i ∈ {1, 2} depends on his decision αi, on the decision αjof customer j, j ∈ {1, 2}, j ≠ i arrived with him and on the system state which is characterized by the mean number of customersN¯in the system. This latter depends on the strategy adopted by the customers presented to the system in the past (before the arriving batch) which is also equal toα=(p,1−p).Then, the expected payoff of customer 1 in the arriving batch can be written as follows:U1(α1,α2,α)=∑n=0∞(p1(U1(E,E,n)p2+U1(E,B,n)(1−p2))+(1−p1)(U1(B,E,n)p2+U1(B,B,n)(1−p2)))Pn.By a similar reasoning, we can obtain the utility function of the second customer. Thus,Ui(αi,αj,α)=pi∑n=0∞(R−Cn+1+12pjμ)Pn,∀i,j∈{1,2},i≠j.After some transformations, we get:(17)Ui(αi,αj,α)=pi(R−CN¯+1+12pjμ)=pi(R−Cpλ(p+2)μ−2pλ+1+12pjμ),∀i,j∈{1,2},i≠j.This brings us to write the final expression of the utility function of each customer as follows:(18)Ui(αi,αj,α)=Ui(α,α,α)=p(R−Cp+22(μ−2pλ)),∀i,j∈{1,2}.Thus, the interactions between both customers in a group, presented to the system at time t, can be modeled as a nonzero-sum game with complete and imperfect information which we denote by J(t), given by:(19)J(t)=<I,{Si}i∈I,{Ui}i∈{1,2}>,where I is the set of players, consisting of both customers and the nature (system),S1=S2=S={E,B}- pure strategies set of both customers,S3=N- nature’s states set, whereNis the set of natural numbers.The extensive form of the game modeling “the intervention” of the system at the first level by choosing a staten∈Nwithout informing customers and the interactions occurring between them is shown in Fig. 6. This kind of games is called by Basar and Olsder (1982) a two-person nonzero-sum game with chance moves.In this section, we give the corresponding Nash equilibrium according to the system’s parameters. The following theorem provides the exact statement.Theorem 2In the unobservable M2/M/1 queue, there exists a probabilitype*=2Rμ−2C4Rλ+C,such that the pair of mixed strategies (α*, α*) ∈ [0, 1]2 × [0, 1]2forms a Nash equilibrium for the game in extensive form depicted inFig. 6, where:α*={(1,0)if4λ≤2μ−3CR;(pe*,1−pe*)if0≤2μ−3CR≤4λ.Utilities at equilibrium are given as follows:(20)U1(α*,α*,α*)=U2(α*,α*,α*)=U(α*,α*,α*)={R−C32μ−4λif4λ≤2μ−3CR;0if0≤2μ−3CR≤4λ.Consider the arrival of two customers. Then we can treat two cases:1.When4λ≤2μ−3CR.Let △2 be the set of all probability distributions on S.Forα*=(1,0),we haveU(α*,α*,α*)=R−C32(μ−2λ)≥0. Then,∀αi=(pi,(1−pi))∈▵2,i∈{1,2},we will have:Ui(αi,α*,α*)=pi(R−C32μ−4λ)≤U(α*,α*,α*).Therefore, the pair of strategies (α*, α*), withα*=(1,0),constitutes a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.When0≤2μ−3CR≤4λ.Forα*=(pe*,1−pe*),we will have:U(α*,α*,α*)=pe*(R−Cpe*+22μ−4pe*λ)=0. Then,∀αi∈▵2,i∈{1,2},Ui(αi,α*,α*)=pi(R−Cpe*+22μ−4pe*λ))=0≤U(α*,α*,α*).Therefore, the pair of strategies (α*, α*), withα*=(2Rμ−2C4Rλ+C,1−2Rμ−2C4Rλ+C),constitutes a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.□Note that there is no case for2μ−3CR<0,because we have assumed that both customers obtain a positive payoff by joining the system when its state is zero (R ≥ 3C/2μ).The joining rate is given by:(21)λeunobs={2λif4λ≤2μ−3CR;2pe*λif0≤2μ−3CR≤4λ,while the social benefit per time unit is:(22)Usunobs={2λ(R−C32μ−4λ)if4λ≤2μ−3CR;2pe*λ(R−Cpe*+22μ−4pe*λ)=0if0≤2μ−3CR≤4λ.In this section, we study the conditions under which it is profitable for the system’s manager or for the server to reveal or conceal the information about the queue length for customers, supposing that he has the power to do it. Then he can use one of the following policies:–To inform customers at their arrival times (Policy 1).Not to inform customers at their arrival times (Policy 2).Each policy has advantages and disadvantages. For the first one, customers enter to the system regularly as long as its size does not exceed the threshold ne. On the other hand, there is a loss of customers, since they do not enter to the system if its size exceeds the thresholdne+1,which constitutes a loss of earnings for the system. Similarly for Policy 2, customers can enter to the system even if its size is very large, because they are not informed, but there is still a loss of customers as they join the queue with some probability, unless this probability is 1.The system’s manager chooses the policy that allows him to maximize the number of customers entering the system. For this, we make a comparison between the joining rate of both policies (λeobsandλeunobs) representing the number of customers who join the queue per time unit in both cases. Thus, we consider the joining rate to be the choice criterion of one of both policies.As shown in Fig. 7 representing the variation ofλeobsandλeunobsaccording to the reward R, obtained using the values (λ=0.5,μ=1.2,C=3), Policy 1 is sometimes better but it was observed that Policy 2 is better in most cases, more precisely from the valueR=9.25. The greatest rate depends on various parameters of the system. WhenR≥3C2μ−4λ(R ≥ 22.5), thenλeunobs=2λ. That means there is no loss of customers (all customers join the queue with probability 1), whereasλeobsis always less than 2λ.In Fig. 8, we present the simulation results duringT=800000time units for different values of ρ, while considering the ratior=CNETNCas a comparison criterion between both policies. CNE represents the number of customers entered to the system and TNC the total number of customers arrived to the system during that time. The system’s manager can choose the policy that allows him to maximize the ratio r.It has been found that, in general, Policy 2 gives better ratio than Policy 1. The number of customers entered to the system decreases when ρ approaches 1; in other words, when the system approaches to saturation. When ρ increases, the arrival rate approaches the service rate, that is why in Policy 1, customers often find the system state around neand consequently an increase in the number of lost customers. In the second policy, this effect is not strong, because customers do not know whether the system is saturated or not, but we see as well as when the system is approaching saturation, then the number of customers entered to the system decreases, because it is clear that the entrance probability (pe*) is a function of ρ. An increase in ρ causes a decrease in r, except whenR∈[3C2μ−4λ,∞[where even if ρ increases, no increase of r can be seen, because customers join the queue with probability 1. The fact that this ratio is generally largest in Policy 2 can be explained by the fact that customers are more prudent in the case of Policy 1.When the ratio r is less than 0.5, it means that the number of lost customers is greater than the number of customers entered to the system, thus customers’ satisfaction is low, customers are generally satisfied otherwise. It would be interesting for the system’s manager to satisfy more customers.
