@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we derive the exact solution of the multi-period portfolio choice problem for an exponential utility function under return predictability. It is assumed that the asset returns depend on predictable variables and that the joint random process of the asset returns and the predictable variables follow a vector autoregressive process. We prove that the optimal portfolio weights depend on the covariance matrices of the next two periods and the conditional mean vector of the next period. The case without predictable variables and the case of independent asset returns are partial cases of our solution. Furthermore, we provide an exhaustive empirical study where the cumulative empirical distribution function of the investor’s wealth is calculated using the exact solution. It is compared with the investment strategy obtained under the additional assumption that the asset returns are independently distributed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Investment analysis and portfolio choice theory are very important and challenging topics in finance and economics nowadays. Since Markowitz (1952) presented his mean-variance paradigm portfolio theory has become a fundamental tool for understanding the interactions of systematic risk and reward.It is well known that the mean-variance optimization problem of Markowitz (1952) is equivalent to the expected exponential utility optimization under the normality assumption (see Merton, 1969). Unfortunately, his approach only gives an answer to the one-period portfolio selection problem in discrete time but it says nothing about the multi-period (long-run) setting. Therefore, it is of importance to investigate the multi-period portfolio optimization problem which is of great relevance for an investor as well. The multi-period portfolio selection problem has been analyzed for different types of utility functions by, e.g., Mossin (1968), Merton (1969), Samuelson (1969), Elton and Gruber (1974), Brandt and Santa-Clara (2006), Liu (2004), Basak and Chabakauri (2010).The continuous case has already been solved for many types of utility functions in the one- and multi-period case by Merton (1969). A number of generalizations under weaker assumptions were given, among others, by Aït-Sahalia, Cacho-Diaz, and Hurd (2009) and Skaf and Boyd (2009). Mossin (1968) considered the case of one risk asset and one riskless asset and derived conditions under which the multi-period strategy becomes myopic or partially myopic. Li, Ng, Tan, and Yang (2005) provided a closed-form solution to the Markowitz mean-variance type optimization problem where the earning-at-risk instead of the variance was used, while Yu, Pang, Troutt, and Hou (2009) compared the performance of different utility functions in continuous time in terms of the optimal final wealth. This was performed under the assumption of the complete market model which is not always fulfilled in practice. More recent findings on the closed-solutions of the dynamic optimal portfolio choice problems are treated in Fu, Lari-Lavassani, and Li (2010) and in Cui, Gao, Li, and Li (2013) who considered the mean-variance optimization with borrowing constraints and with no-shorting constraints respectively. Finally, Yu, Takahashi, Inoue, and Wang (2010) presented the results for the maximum absolute deviation model.Li, Xia, and Yan (2001) pointed out that the problem of finding the optimal investment strategy in multi-period setting becomes more complex for discrete time incomplete markets. On the other hand, the discrete time setting is more useful and seems to be more realistic for the investors because they observe the underlying data-generating process discretely and make their decisions only at discrete points of time. In other words, they would prefer to deal with the time series models rather than the stochastic differential equations for modeling the asset returns. Moreover, the continuous time portfolio strategies are often inadmissible in discrete time because they may cause a negative wealth (see, Brandt, Aït-Sahalia, & Hansen, 2010). In general, there are not many closed-form solutions provided in the literature to the discrete-time multi-period case. For instance, a closed-form solution for the multi-period portfolio choice problem exists for the quadratic utility function under the assumption that the asset returns are independently distributed (see Leippold, Vanini, & Trojani, 2004; Li & Ng, 2000). However, the assumption of independence is unfortunately not fulfilled in many applications. As a result, analytical solutions of the discrete-time multi-period optimal portfolio choice problems are hard to obtain. They are only available for some partial cases and are often derived under very restrictive assumptions on the distribution of the asset returns.In the present paper we consider an investor who invests into k risky assets and one riskless asset with an investment strategy based on the exponential utility function(1)U(Wt)=−e−αWt.Here Wtdenotes the investor’s wealth at period t and α > 0 stands for the coefficient of absolute risk aversion (ARA), which is a constant over time for the exponential utility (CARA utility). The application of the exponential utility function is more plausible than the use of the quadratic utility since the last one possesses an increasing risk aversion coefficient. That is why the exponential utility function is commonly used in portfolio selection theory. Moreover, the optimization of the expected exponential utility function leads to the well known mean-variance utility maximization problem and consequently its solution lays on the mean-variance efficient frontier. This is also true when the uncertainty of the asset returns is taken into account (see, Bodnar, Parolya, & Schmid, 2013).There are only a few papers in literature where the exponential utility function is considered in the multi-period discrete time setting. For instance, Liu (2004) presented the solution of the multi-period portfolio selection problem in continuous time with exponential utility and independently distributed returns, while Çanakoǧlu and Özekici (2009) solved the portfolio choice problem assuming that the stochastic market follows a discrete time Markov chain and all parameters of the asset returns, i.e., mean vector and covariance matrix, depend only on the current state of the stochastic market and not on the previous states which is equivalent to the assumption of independence in our settings. In the paper of Soyer and Tanyeri (2006) a Bayesian computational approach with the exponential utility was presented. The authors argued that the solution of the multi-period portfolio choice problem with the exponential utility under the assumption of normality ”… cannot be evaluated in closed form and the optimal portfolio cannot be obtained analytically”. In this paper, however, we present an exact solution assuming that the asset returns follow a vector autoregressive process with predictable variables.As a result, we extend the previous findings on the exponential utility function in three ways: (i) we do not assume the independence of the asset returns in time; (ii) taking into account the untradable predictable variables, we work in the presence of the incomplete market; and (iii) we derive a closed-form solution of the discrete-time multi-period portfolio choice problem with the exponential utility function (1) under the assumption that the joint process consists of the asset returns and the predictable variables and it is assumed to follow a vector autoregressive (VAR) process. The latter model is very popular in finance and it is often used for modeling the asset returns (see, e.g., Barberis & Nicholas, 2000; Brandt et al., 2010; Brandt & Santa-Clara, 2006; Campbell, 1991; 1996; Lynch, 2001; Lynch & Tan, 2010; Zhu, 2013). Particularly, Lynch (2001) studied the impact of the return predictability (measured by the dividend yield) on the multi-period investor, whereas more modern methods involving return predictability and its implications in portfolio selection were treated in Zhu (2013). Finally, Lynch and Tan (2010) presented a numerical solution of the multi-period problem under the power utility function for assets with predictable returns, which is very general and considers several aspects of a portfolio problem, such as solvency constraints, transaction costs and restrictions on borrowing or short sales. The above important aspects are not treated in detail in the present paper and are left for future research.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the main result of the paper is given. In Theorem 1 an analytical expression of the portfolio weights is provided for each period. In Corollary 1, the case without a predictable vector is considered while independent asset returns are treated in Corollary 2. In Section 3 the results of the empirical studies are presented. The performance of the derived strategy is compared with the one for independent asset returns. The comparison is performed in terms of the cumulative empirical distribution function of the investor’s wealth at the end of the investment period. We find significant improvements if the dependence structure is taken into account. Section 4 contains a short summary.In this section we derive the analytical solution of the multi-period portfolio choice problem for an exponential utility function assuming that the asset returns and the predictable variables follow a VAR(1) process.Let Xt= (Xt, 1, Xt, 2, …, Xt, k)′ denote the vector of the returns (e.g., log-returns) of k risky assets and let rf, tbe the return of the riskless asset at time t. Let ztbe a p-dimensional vector of predictable variables. We assume thatYt=(Xt′,zt′)′follows a VAR(1) process given by(2)Yt=ν˜+Φ˜Yt−1+ɛ˜twhere the (k + p)-dimensional vectorν˜and the (k + p) × (k + p)-dimensional matrixΦ˜contain the model parameters andɛ˜t∼N(0,Σ˜(t)),whereΣ˜(t)is a (k + p) × (k + p)-dimensional positive definite deterministic matrix function. LetFtdenote the information set available at time t. ThenYt|Ft−1∼Nk+p(μ˜t,Σ˜(t)),i.e., the conditional distribution of YtgivenFt−1is a (k + p)-dimensional normal distribution with mean vectorμ˜t=E(Yt|Ft−1)=Et−1(Yt)and covariance matrixVar(Yt|Ft−1)=Σ˜(t).The stochastic model (2) is described in detail by Campbell, Chan, and Viceira (2003) who argued that the application of VAR(1) is not a restrictive assumption because every vector autoregression can be presented as a VAR(1) process through an expansion of the vector of state (predictable) variables. The idea behind this approach is to find a vector of predictable variables ztwhich is mostly correlated with the asset returns and to build a VAR(1) process with respect to the asset returns Xtand the vector of predictable variables zt. The choice of ztdepends rather on the data and not on the utility function. Possible predictable variables are, e.g., the dividend yield (cf. Campbell et al., 2003; Lynch, 2001), the term spread (see, e.g, Brandt & Santa-Clara, 2006) or another asset return.It is noted that the whole vector Ytitself is not interesting to the investor because it usually contains untradable assets (predictable variables). The investor cannot earn the money from the p-predictable variables, therefore, it is more useful to get back the return vector Xtwhich consists of the risky assets only. Letν=Lν˜andΦ=LΦ˜with L = [IkOk, p] where Ikis a k × k identity matrix and Ok, pis a k × p matrix of zeros. From (2) we obtain the following model for Xtexpressed as11Using the matrix L we cut off the last p elements (predictable variables) of the whole vector Ytto get the vector Xtwith tradable risky assets only which depends on the predictable variables zt.(3)Xt=LYt=Lν˜+LΦ˜Yt−1+Lɛ˜t=ν+ΦYt−1+ɛt.Consequently, the conditional distribution of XtgivenFt−1is a multivariate normal distribution with conditional mean vectorμt=E(Xt|Ft−1)=ν+ΦYt−1and conditional covariance matrixΣ(t)=Var(Xt|Ft−1)=LΣ˜(t)L′,that isXt|Ft−1∼Nk(μt,Σ(t)). Note that the vector of asset returns Xtstill depends on the predictable variables ztvia the parameter matrixΦ=LΦ˜.Let wt= (wt, 1, wt, 2, …, wt, k)′ denote the vector of the portfolio weights of the k risky assets at period t. Then the evolution of the investor’s wealth is expressed as(4)Wt=Wt−1(1+rf,t+wt−1′(Xt−rf,t1))=Wt−1(Rf,t+wt−1′X˘t),where Rf, t= 1 + rf, tandX˘t=Xt−rf,t1withμ˘t=Et−1(X˘t)=ν+ΦYt−1−rf,t1. The aim of the investor is to maximize the expected utility of the final wealth.The optimization problem is given by(5)V(0,W0,F0)=max{ws}s=0T−1Et[U(WT)]with the terminal condition(6)U(WT)=−exp(−αWT)forα>0.Following Pennacchi (2008) the optimization problem (5) can be solved by applying the following Bellman equation at time point T − t(7)V(T−t,WT−t,FT−t)=maxwT−tET−t[max{ws}s=T−t+1T−1ET−t+1[U(WT)]]=maxwT−tET−t[V(T−t+1,WT−t(rf,T−t+wT−t+1*′X˘T−t+1),FT−t+1)]subject to (6), wherewT−t+1*are the optimal portfolio weights at period T − t + 1. Note that in contrast to the static case now the vector of optimal portfolio weights wT − tis a function of the weights of the next periods, i.e., of wT − t + 1, wT − t + 2, …, wT − 1, what is the consequence of the backward recursion method (see, e.g. Pennacchi, 2008).For the period T − 1 we get(8)V(T−1,WT−1,FT−1)=ET−1[−exp(−αWT−1(Rf,T+wT−1′X˘T))]=−exp(−αWT−1Rf,T)ET−1[exp(−αWT−1wT−1′X˘T)]=exp(−αWT−1Rf,T)(−exp[−α2−α(WT−1wT−1′μ˘T−α2wT−1′Σ(T)wT−1WT−12)])→max.The last optimization problem is equivalent to(9)WT−1wT−1′μ˘T−α2wT−1′Σ(T)wT−1WT−12→maxoverwT−1.Taking the derivative and solving (9) with respect to wT − 1 we get the classical solution for the period T − 1(10)wT−1*=1αWT−1Σ−1(T)μ˘T=1αWT−1(LΣ˜(T)L′)−1(ν˘T+ΦYT−1)withν˘T=ν−rf,T1.In Theorem 1 the multi-period portfolio weights for all periods from 0 to T − 1 are given.Theorem 1LetXτ= (Xτ, 1, Xτ, 2, …, Xτ, k)′ be a random return vector of k risky assets. Suppose thatXτand the vector of p predictable variableszτjointly follow a VAR(1) process as defined in (2). Let rf, τbe the return of the riskless asset. Then the optimal multi-period portfolio weights are given by (10) for period T − 1,(11)wT−2*=1αWT−2Rf,T(LΣ˜−1(T−1)μ˜T−1*−LΦ′Σ−1(T)(ν˘T+rf,TΦL′1)),and(12)wT−t*=CT−t(LΣ˜−1(T−t+1)μ˜T−t+1*−LΦ˜′Σ˜−1(T−t+2)×(ν˘T−t+3*+rf,T−t+2Φ˜L′1))for t = 3, …, T with(13)CT−t=1αWT−t(∏i=T−t+2TRf,i)−1,μ˜T−t+1*=μ˜T−t+1−rf,T−t+2L′1and(14)ν˘T−t+3*=ν˜−rf,T−t+3L′1.The value function at time point T − 2 is obtained by substituting (10) into (8)(15)V(T−2,WT−2,FT−2)=−ET−2[exp(−αWT−1Rf,T−12s˘T)]=−exp(−αWT−2Rf,T−1Rf,T)ET−2×[exp(−αWT−2Rf,TwT−2′X˘T−1−12s˘T)],wheres˘T=μ˘T′Σ(T)−1μ˘T. Second, according to the properties of VAR(1) processes we get that(16)s˘T=Y˘T−1′Φ′Σ−1(T)ΦY˘T−1+2Y˘T−1′Φ′Σ−1(T)ν˘T+(ν˘T+rf,TΦL′1)′Σ−1(T)(ν˘T+rf,TΦL′1),withY˘t=Yt−rf,tL′1. This is a quadratic form with respect to the conditional normally distributed vector YT − 1. Moreover, using LL′ = Ik,(17)wT−2′X˘T−1=wT−2′(LYT−1−rf,T1)=wT−2′LY˘T−1and (15), we get(18)V(T−2,WT−2,FT−2)=−exp(−αWT−2Rf,TRf,T−1)×ET−2[exp(−12Y˘T−1′B(T)Y˘T−1−b(wT−2)′Y˘T−1−c)],where(19)BT=Φ′Σ−1(T)Φ,(20)b(wT−2)=Φ′Σ−1(T)ν˘T+αWT−2Rf,TL′wT−2+rf,TB(T)L′1(21)andc=12(ν˘T+rf,TΦL′1)′Σ−1(T)(ν˘T+rf,TΦL′1).Following Mathai and Provost (1992, Theorem 3.2a.1) the expectation given in (18) is the moment generating function of the quadratic form in normal variables at point − 1. Hence, it holds that(22)V(T−2,WT−2,FT−2)=−exp(−αWT−2Rf,T−1Rf,T)|I+B(T)Σ˜(T−1)|−12×exp[−12(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1)′Σ˜−1(T−1)(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1)−c+12(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1−Σ˜(T−1)b(wT−2))′×(I+B(T)Σ˜(T−1))−1Σ˜−1(T−1)×(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1−Σ˜(T−1)b(wT−2))−12],whereET−2[Y˘T−1]=μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1. Thus, the optimization problemV(T−2,WT−2,FT−2)→max is equivalent toV*(T−2,WT−2,FT−2)→max, where(23)V*(T−2,WT−2,FT−2)=−12(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1−Σ˜(T−1)b(wT−2))′×(I+B(T)Σ˜(T−1))−1Σ˜(T−1)−1×(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1−Σ˜(T−1)b(wT−2))=−12(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1−Σ˜(T−1)b(wT−2))′×(Σ˜(T−1)+Σ˜(T−1)B(T)Σ˜(T−1))−1×(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1−Σ˜(T−1)b(wT−2)).Because the matrixΣ˜(T−1)+Σ˜(T−1)B(T)Σ˜(T−1)is positive definite the maximum ofV*(T−2,WT−2,FT−2)is attained atwT−2*for which(24)μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1=Σ˜(T−1)b(wT−2*).Using that LL′ = Ikwe obtain(25)wT−2*=1αWT−2Rf,T(LΣ˜−1(T−1)(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1)−LΦ′Σ−1(T)(ν˘T+rf,TΦL′1)).Furthermore, the equality (24) leads to(26)V(T−2,WT−2,FT−2)=−|I+B(T)Σ˜(T−1)|−12exp(−c)×exp(−αWT−2Rf,T−1Rf,T−12(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1)′×Σ˜−1(T−1)(μ˜T−1−rf,TL′1)−αWT−2Rf,T−1Rf,T−12)(27)=−|I+B(T)Σ˜(T−1)|−12exp(−c)×exp(−12Y˘T−2′B˜(T−1)Y˘T−2−b˜′(wT−3)Y˘T−2−c˜),where(28)B˜(T−1)=Φ˜′Σ˜−1(T−1)Φ˜,(29)b˜(wT−3)=Φ˜′Σ˜−1(T−1)(ν˜−rf,TL′1)+αWT−3Rf,T−1L′wT−3+rf,T−1B˜(T−1)L′1(30)andc˜=12(ν˜−rf,TL′1+rf,T−1Φ˜L′1)′Σ˜−1(T−1)×(ν˜−rf,TL′1+rf,T−1Φ˜L′1).Taking the conditional expectation from the value function (26) with respect toFT−3we receive(31)V(T−3,WT−3,FT−3)=−|I+B(T)Σ˜(T−1)|−12exp(−c)×ET−3(exp(−12Y˘T−2′B˜(T−1)Y˘T−2−b˜′(wT−3)Y˘T−1−c˜)).Consequently, the value function for the period T − 3 has a similar structure thanV(T−2,WT−2,FT−2)with the only difference that B(T) is replaced byB˜(T−1),b(wT − 2) byb˜(wT−3)and c byc˜. It follows immediately that the optimal portfolio weights at period T − 3 are(32)wT−3*=1αWT−3Rf,TRf,T−1(LΣ˜−1(T−2)μ˜T−2*−LΦ˜′Σ˜−1(T−1)(ν˘T*+rf,T−1Φ˜L′1))withμ˜T−2*=μ˜T−2−rf,T−1L′1andν˘T*=ν˜−rf,TL′1.The last step is to use mathematical induction with basis T − 3 in order to receive the statement of Theorem 1.□The results of Theorem 1 show us that the optimal portfolio weights at every period of time except the last one depend on the covariance matrices of the next two periods and the conditional mean vector of the next period. This property turns out to be very useful if we want to calculate the optimal portfolio weights for a real data set. Moreover, Theorem 1 presents a solution to the discrete-time multi-period optimal portfolio choice problem with the CARA utility in the presence of an incomplete market.Note that the case without predictable variables (the case with a complete market) is a special case of Theorem 1. In this case the following expressions are obtained.Corollary 1LetXτ= (Xτ, 1, Xτ, 2, …, Xτ, k)′ be a random return vector of k risky assets which follows a VAR(1) process as defined in (2) but without a vector of predictable variables zτ. Let rf, τbe the return of the riskless asset. Then the optimal multi-period portfolio weights for period T − 1 are given by(33)wT−1*=1αWT−1Σ−1(T)μ˘T=1αWT−1Σ−1(T)(ν˘T+ΦYT−1)withν˘T=ν−rf,T1and for t = 2, …, T by(34)wT−t*=CT−t(Σ−1(T−t+1)μ˘T−t+1−Φ′Σ−1(T−t+2)×(ν˘T−t+2+rf,T−t+2Φ1)),withCT−t=1αWT−t∏i=T−t+2TRf,i.The results of Corollary 1 are obtained in the same way as the results of Theorem 1 by putting L = Ikand Yt= Xt(p = 0).□In Corollary 2 the return vectors are assumed to be independent.Corollary 2LetXτ= (Xτ, 1, Xτ, 2, …, Xτ, k)′ be a sequence of the independently and identically normally distributed vectors of k risky assets, i.e.,Xτ∼N(μ,Σ). Let rf, τbe the return of the riskless asset. We assume thatΣis positive definite. Then for all t = 1, …, T the optimal multi-period portfolio weights for period T − t are given by(35)wT−t*=1αWT−t∏i=T−t+2TRf,iΣ−1μ˘withμ˘=μ−rf,T−t+21.Corollary 2 immediately follows from Corollary 1 puttingΦ= 0, Σ(t) =Σandν=μ.□The results of Corollary 2 can be obtained as a partial case of Çanakoǧlu and Özekici (2009), where the stochastic market was presented by a discrete time Markov chain. In that case the asset returns depend on the present state of the market and not on the previous ones which implies the independence of the asset return over time.It is noted that the dynamics of the optimal portfolio weights in Corollary 2 is hidden in the coefficient of the absolute risk aversion α which is given byατ=(αWT−τ∏i=T−τ+2TRf,i)−1. Moreover, the expressions of the weights themselves are proportional to the weights of the so-called tangency portfolio (cf. Britten-Jones (1999); Ingersoll (1987, p. 89)). Because the tangency portfolio is usually considered as a market portfolio in the single-period allocation problem (see, e.g., Britten-Jones, 1999) we treat the weights given in (35) as the weights of a benchmark portfolio in our empirical study presented in the next section.In this section we apply the results of Section 2 to real data of weekly asset returns. Although monthly returns are closer to the normal distribution for short periods of time, the application of monthly data for long periods can lead to biased results because the parameters of the asset returns are not constants over time. On the other hand, the daily data is far away from the normality. Thus, we choose weekly data in our empirical study as a feasible alternative between daily and monthly data.In following we consider an investor who invests into an international portfolio. The portfolio consists of the capital market indices of five developed stock markets, namely Belgium, Germany, Japan, the UK, and the USA. We deal with weekly data of the MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International) indices for the equity market returns from the January 4, 2002 to December 4, 2009. A process is fitted to the log-return series Ytvia the maximum likelihood method (c.f., Brockwell & Davis, 1991). It is expressed as(36)Yt=ν˜+Φ˜Yt−1+ɛ˜twithɛ˜t∼iiN(0,Σ˜ɛ).We get(37)ν˜=[4.83e−041.20e−036.74e−045.54e−042.79e−05],Φ˜=[0.2011**−0.15920.01892−0.1960.455***0.3139***−0.1231−0.00191−0.511***0.434***0.04870.0888−0.12131**−0.224**0.343***0.1829**−0.08890.00988−0.441***0.382***0.0766−0.0643−0.03049−0.1140.133],andΣ˜ɛ=[0.00130851860.00105444960.00043657530.00091203730.00067812890.00105444960.00138335400.00056482370.00102185390.00083323140.00043657530.00056482370.00079943410.00047333660.00036670120.00091203730.00102185390.00047333660.00101767930.00069272510.00067812890.00083323140.00036670120.00069272510.0007242233],where *** denotes that the coefficient is significant at level 1percent, ** – significant at level 5percent, and * – significant at level 10percent.It is remarkable that the last column of the matrixΦ˜has the largest values which indicates on a strong positive correlation between the US market and the other markets. Moreover, it shows that the influence of the US market on the return indices is larger than those of the domestic ones. Following Campbell et al. (2003) we choose the stock index of the US market as a predictable variable ztin our empirical study.Next, we calculate the weights of the two multi-period portfolio strategies for an exponential utility function. We want to compare the case of correlated return vectors given in Theorem 1 with the case of independent variables given in Corollary 2 which completely ignores the time dependence structure well documented for real data. Note that this benchmark strategy coincides with the strategy derived by Çanakoǧlu and Özekici (2009) where the market was assumed to follow a Markov chain. It is the only state-of-art strategy for the discrete-time multi-period portfolio choice problem with the exponential utility function which exists in the literature up to now.The performance of both strategies is compared with each other via an extensive simulation study based on 105 independent repetitions. The multi-period portfolio strategies are constructed for T ∈ {13, 26, 52, 104} and for the coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA) αr∈ {0.8, 2}. The RRA αr= αW0 is chosen as a constant absolute risk aversion (ARA) α in this study (without loss of generality we put W0 = 1). In order to compare the performance of these two strategies we determine the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) of the investor’s terminal wealth and portfolio turnover (trading volume) for each strategy as well as we calculate the certainty equivalent for the same values of α as a function of T. The portfolio turnover is calculated following the procedure described in DeMiguel, Garlappi, Nogales, and Uppal (2009), whereas the definition of the certainty equivalent is presented in Balduzzi and Lynch (1999). It is calculated by using U(CE) = E[U(WT)], which leads to(38)CE=U−1(E[U(WT)])=−1/αlogE(e−αWT).The obtained results are presented in Figs. 1–5. If we compare the performance of two portfolio strategies by their ECDFs, we should choose the strategy whose distribution function lies below the other because the probability of getting a larger wealth (or portfolio turnover) is larger for the strategy with a stochastically smaller distribution function. This method of comparison is common in finance and it is also known in probability theory as the first order stochastic dominance. Alternatively, the comparison between the trading strategies can be performed in terms of the second order stochastic dominance. However, since the first order stochastic dominance implies the second order one and in the present case a clear comparison has already been attained under the first order stochastic dominance, we do not present results for the second order stochastic dominance. Furthermore, because both strategies have small probabilities of bankruptcy, the comparison via second order stochastic dominance (conditional VaR) is not relevant in our study.The strategy based on the weights given in Theorem 1 is denoted by EXP, while the notation EXP-iid is used for the method with the weights of Corollary 2. It is noted that for the exponential utility, unlike other utility functions, the larger coefficient of risk aversion α corresponds to the fewer risk aversion of the utility function. Indeed, when we set α → +∞ in (1) the investor becomes risk neutral (U(W) = 0).Fig. 1 presents the results for a smaller value of the coefficient α which indicates a greater utility risk aversion. Weobserve that EXP overperforms EXP-iid for all considered investment periods T. For instance, for T = 104 the probability of getting a wealth between 60 and 80 is equal to roughly 25percent for EXP while it is almost zero for EXP-iid. For a small horizon T there exists a small probability of bankruptcy for both strategies but it differs not significantly. For T ≥ 52 the probability of a loss tends to zero. The EXP and the EXP-iid strategies both improve as T becomes larger what indicates their good performance in the long-run setting. Similar results are obtained for larger values of the coefficient of the relative risk aversion (i.e. smaller utility risk) (see Fig. 2). The performance of the EXP strategy is better for all T. From the other side, the probability of obtaining a larger value of the wealth is for both strategies smaller in comparison to the results presented in Fig. 1 which is not surprising because the investor follows less risky situation.In Fig. 3 we provide the values of the certainty equivalent of the final wealth for both strategies as a function of the investment horizon T. The situation is very similar to the case of the final wealth. Namely, we observe that the EXP strategy dominates the EXP-iid uniformly for positive levels of certainty equivalent. Again, in the case of high risk α = 0.8 this dominance is larger than for the situation with the low risk α = 2. Figs. 4 and 5 show us the empirical distribution of the trading volumes obtained for both considered portfolio policies. As expected, the EXP strategy has uniformly larger turnover as EXP-iid which indicates that the EXP portfolio weights deviate larger from the static (myopic) portfolio weights as EXP-iid ones. This deviation becomes slightly smaller in the case of low risk level α = 2 (see, Fig. 5).Using the results of Figs.1–5 we conclude that the EXP strategy has a higher performance for all T and risk levels although both the policies possess a maximum utility of wealth. Of course this is not surprising since more information about the distribution of the asset returns is taken into account. On the other hand, ignoring the time dependence of the asset returns weakens the results with respect to the final wealth but it does not influence the probability of being bankrupt at the end of the investment period.In the second partof the simulation study we construct a multi-period optimal portfolio based on six stocks, namely Beiersdorf, Deutsche Bank, Linde, Allianz, Bayer and Continental, which are all included in the DAX 30 index. We consider weekly data from the 3rd of January 2000 to the 17th of June 2013.

Thus, we take the main DAX 30 index as a predictable variable and consider an investment strategy into the six considered stocks in this simulation study.We use the same comparison method as for the international portfolio discussed in Section 3.1, namely the first-order stochastic dominance method. In Figs. 6–10 we present the results for different risk levels α and conclude that the EXP strategy also stochastically dominates the EXP-iid strategy in terms of the terminal wealth, certainty equivalent and trading volume. Indeed, in Fig. 6 (α = 0.8 and T = 104) the probability of obtaining the wealth from the interval [40, 60] is roughly equal to 20percent for the EXP policy while for the EXP-iid policy it is equal to zero. A similar situation can be observed in Fig. 7 for the low-risky situation (α = 2). In general, the behavior of both strategies is similar to the case of the international portfolio, namely the EXP strategy dominates the EXP-iid one over all values of T (except of some small T, where EXP-iid might have a little advantage for small wealth levels) and this dominance increases when T increases. The results obtained for certainty equivalent as well as for trading volume are very similar to ones presented in case of international portfolio in Section 3.1.In this section we want to inspect the performance of the proposed EXP strategy and the benchmark EXP-iid strategy in the case of time varying covariance matrixΣ˜(t). In order to do this we generate the process from Section 3.2 in the following way(41)Yt=ν˜+Φ˜Yt−1+ɛ˜twithɛ˜t∼iiN(0,Σ˜ɛ(t))whereν˜,Φ˜are given in Section 3.2. For simplicity,Σ˜ɛ(1)=Σ˜ɛwhereΣ˜ɛis given in Section 3.2. The covariance matrix at time point t is determined byΣ˜ɛ(t)=DtΣ˜ɛDtwithΣ˜ɛ=diag(d1,t,…,dk,t). The diagonal elements of Dt, i.e., di, t, i = 1,…, k, are generated independently from the uniform distribution on the interval [0.5, 2]. Thus, the variances of the process became time-varying and the correlations are kept constant. The situation of time-varying correlations is not treated in the present paper but it can be performed similarly. In the present case the EXP-iid strategy becomes just independent one because the covariance matrices change over time (see, (10)). For that reason we make use of the notation EXP-ind instead of EXP-iid in this subsection.The results are presented in Figs. 11–15 in the same way as in the two previous subsections. Namely, we consider the ECDFs of the terminal wealth and trading volume for different risk levels α ∈ {0.8, 2} as well as present the values of certainty equivalent as a function of T for the same values of α. We still observe a clear uniform dominance of the proposed EXP policy for almost all values of T which increases when T becomes large.To summarize, we conclude that taking into account the dependence between the return vectors in time can substantially increase the performance of the optimal multi-period portfolio decision rule for the exponential utility function in the case of the incomplete market. Moreover, the presence of the analytical solution simplifies the computations significantly and leads to the feasible policies which can easily be used in practice.
