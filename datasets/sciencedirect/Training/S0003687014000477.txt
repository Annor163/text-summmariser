@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Sound is often considered as a negative aspect of an environment that needs mitigating, particularly in hospitals. It is worthwhile however, to consider how subjective responses to hospital sounds can be made more positive. The authors identified natural sound, steady state sound and written sound source information as having the potential to do this. Listening evaluations were conducted with 24 participants who rated their emotional (Relaxation) and cognitive (Interest and Understanding) response to a variety of hospital ward soundscape clips across these three interventions. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the ‘Relaxation’ response was significantly affected (n2 = 0.05, p = 0.001) by the interventions with natural sound producing a 10.1% more positive response. Most interestingly, written sound source information produced a 4.7% positive change in response. The authors conclude that exploring different ways to improve the sounds of a hospital offers subjective benefits that move beyond sound level reduction. This is an area for future work to focus upon in an effort to achieve more positively experienced hospital soundscapes and environments.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
It is commonly accepted that the hospital environment affects patients' experiences when they are admitted and treated in these spaces (see Dijkstra et al., 2006). Research on healthcare design and planning has highlighted strong relationships between environmental characteristics and human health (Monti et al., 2012). Sound is one part of the hospital environment. Ergonomics evaluations commonly consider the sound level of spaces, such as offices (Passero and Zannin, 2012) and consider the effect of them in reference to guidelines. Many studies have used this approach for hospitals and documented sound level within acute care hospital spaces (Busch-Vishniac et al., 2005; Okcu et al., 2011; Salandina et al., 2011). Sound levels range from 60 to 70 dB(A) with peaks of around 90 dB(A), equivalent to a busy motorway (Joseph and Ulrich, 2007). These exceed recommendations produced by bodies such as the World Health Organisation (Berglund et al., 2000) or the UK Government (Department of Health, 2008) by around 20–30 dB(A).Consideration is needed however, of how sound contributes to the feeling of the hospital space as ‘quietness’ is a quality indicator which is associated with a lack of annoying noises rather than the absence of sound itself (Fornara et al., 2006). Although there can be negative health consequences of excessive sound within these spaces (Ulrich, 1992), there is potential for positive benefits in understanding and maintaining the soundscape of the ward; for instance hearing the various occupational sounds, such as tea trolleys, as positive sounds (Mackrill et al., 2013a). A soundscape is defined as the auditory version of a landscape (Schafer, 1976) and considers the complete sound environment rather than focusing on a single source such as the beep of a monitor. As control of hospital sounds should consider positive aspects and move away from sound level measurement (Dawson, 2005) understanding the soundscape offers a new approach, particularly as the sound quality is not simply determined by level but other factors such as physical space (Hignett and Lu, 2010).Investigating the subjective response to the existing soundscape may create a more feasible way of improving the sound of the spaces, particularly as there is a consistent trend of rising levels since the 1960s (Busch-Vishniac et al., 2005). Therefore, a need to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aiming to improve the subjective response to a hospital ward soundscape has arisen. Although studies have investigated subjective responses to hospital sounds to a certain degree (Topf, 1985; Akansel and Kaymakci, 2008; Xie and Kang, 2010) none have considered how to create a positive soundscape using interventions which may be of practical benefit.The aim of this study was to use laboratory listening evaluations to test interventions which might create a more positive emotional-cognitive response to hearing the soundscape of a cardiothoracic (CT) ward. This evaluated the effect of soundscape interventions to understand which may be considered appropriate for investigation within the ward setting. This was the third stage in a four part research project aiming at understanding and improving the perception of a hospital ward soundscape (Fig. 1). Part 1 aimed to understand the perception of the soundscape and inform the direction of subsequent steps. Part 2 created a framework to measure the response to the soundscape with this being used to understand the effect of soundscape interventions in Part 3, presented here. From this theoretical generalisation Part 4 was carried out in-situ to evaluate the chosen intervention.The following soundscape interventions were used based on the premise that sound level reduction would not necessary create a more positive soundscape. As a result it was hypothesised that the soundscape would elicit more positive responses when each intervention was applied to the existing sound clips of the CT soundscape.Natural sound (NS) was selected due to the agreement from literature (Guastavino, 2006; Pheasant et al., 2010; Yang and Kang, 2005a,b) which advocates that natural sounds of birdsong and water are positive soundscape features. Additionally, Mackrill et al. (2013a) found natural sounds to be a positive aspect of the CT ward soundscape when heard through windows overlooking a green space.Steady state sound (SSS) was chosen as an intervention as masking sounds are a way in which negative sound can be controlled (Bowman, 1974). Defined as the presence of one sound that renders another sound undetectable (Plack, 2005), this has been tested to improve hospital soundscape perception (see Stanchina et al., 2005). When white noise was added to the sounds of an intensive care unit, despite an increase in sound level, subjectively sleep was consolidated and arousal was less frequent (Stanchina et al., 2005). Despite a small sample and a non-significant effect, this shows a change in perception.Written information detailing the various sound sources of the soundscape was chosen as hospital wards produce a sensory overload of unfamiliar stimuli which bombard patients with experiences they are unaccustomed to (Akansel and Kaymakci, 2008). Understanding hospital sounds however, enables patients to habituate and accept sound (Mackrill et al., 2013a). As complex environmental sounds are processed as meaningful events, providing information about interactions with environment (Guastavino et al., 2005), it may be necessary for patients to understand the sounds of the ward in order to feel comfortable within it. Furthermore, Topf (2000) suggests that personal control is the capacity to regulate stress caused by a negative event. This may be a cognitive approach by having information about the stressor (Topf, 2000). As such, it was proposed that providing information detailing what can be heard in the soundscape may improve the feeling that the soundscape elicits. This is called sound source information (SSI).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
It was found that natural sound and written sound source information were the most effective intervention at altering the emotional-cognitive response to individuals hearing soundscape clips of a CT ward. Potentially, these interventions could improve the perception of the soundscape and the feeling of being in the hospital space. It is SSI that offers an interesting and simple way to enable individuals to potentially understand the soundscape of a hospital ward. Future work can now be done to look at this in-situ to assess if this simple intervention can be of benefit to patients within hospital environments. It is hoped that the discussion here may bring the concept of the soundscape to the ergonomics arena, which may be integrated into holistic environmental evaluations.
