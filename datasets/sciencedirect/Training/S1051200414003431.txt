@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper deals with the design of the low complexity and efficient dynamic spectrum learning and access (DSLA) scheme for next-generation heterogeneous decentralized Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) such as Long Term Evolution-Advanced and 5G. Existing DSLA schemes for decentralized CRNs are focused predominantly on the decision making policies which perform the task of orthogonalization of secondary users to optimum vacant subbands of fixed bandwidth. The focus of this paper is the design of DSLA scheme for decentralized CRNs to support the tunable vacant bandwidth requirements of the secondary users while minimizing the computationally intensive subband switchings. We first propose a new low complexity VDF which is designed by modifying second order frequency transformation and subsequently combining it with the interpolation technique. It is referred to as Interpolation and Modified Frequency Transformation based VDF (IMFT-VDF) and it provides tunable bandpass responses anywhere over Nyquist band with complete control over the bandwidth as well as the center frequency. Second, we propose a tunable decision making policy,ρt_rand, consisting of learning and access unit, and is designed to take full advantage of exclusive frequency response control offered by IMFT-VDF. The simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed DSLA scheme over the existing DSLA schemes while complexity comparisons indicate total gate count savings from 11% to as high as 87% over various existing schemes. Also, lower number of subband switchings make the proposed scheme power-efficient and suitable for battery-operated cognitive radio terminals.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Dynamic spectrum learning and access (DSLA) based Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) paradigm has been suggested to improve the overall utilization of the spectrum, which is crowded yet underutilized mainly due to static spectrum allocation policies [1,2]. In CRNs, multiple secondary (unlicensed) users can access the vacant frequency subbands in an opportunistic way with minimal interference to the primary (licensed) users [1,2]. Recently, the term “Green CRN” has been coined, which refers to the CRN which will minimize theCO2emissions (by using area and energy efficient radio terminals) along with improving the spectrum utilization [3,4]. These CRNs can be deployed for smart grid networks, public safety networks, health-care networks, cellular networks [5] etc.The two representative DSLA approaches are: 1) DSLA for centralized CRNs (centralized DSLA): A central unit is responsible for orthogonalization of M secondary users to optimum subbands (i.e., the subset of M subbands which are identified as superior, in terms of their probability of being vacant, lower interference and noise levels etc., amongst all available subbands in wideband input signal) [6,7], 2) DSLA for decentralized CRNs (decentralized DSLA): Each secondary user independently learns, senses and accesses the vacant subbands without any explicit information exchanges or pre-agreements with other users [6–14]. The centralized DSLA schemes using game theory approach, auction based approach, multi-armed bandit based approach etc. have been proposed and more details can be found in [6,7]. Various decentralized DSLA schemes are discussed in detail in Section 2.2. In summary, the decentralized DSLA has the advantages such as ease of implementation, robustness to link or node failures, no communication overhead and lower delay over the centralized DSLA [6–14]. As a result, decentralized DSLA is preferred choice for public safety networks and proximity-aware social networking services. However, decentralized DSLA suffers from lower utilization of optimum subbands due to the potentially higher number of collisions between the secondary users. This is because of the lack of coordination among secondary users as well as hardware and signal processing constraints at each secondary user terminal.Existing centralized as well as decentralized DSLA schemes [6–11,13,14] assume that the vacant bandwidth requirements of all secondary users are fixed and equal. Such assumption may not be true in the next-generation heterogeneous CRNs such as 5G where multiple wireless communication standards with distinct channel bandwidths co-exist. In order to extend the capabilities of such decentralized CRNs beyond voice to video, data, location and Internet based services demanding distinct bandwidths and to seamlessly integrate multiple services on a single terminal, a tunable decentralized DSLA scheme is desired.Another constraint for efficient DSLA scheme is the total penalty incurred in terms of delay, energy consumption, hardware reconfiguration and protocol overhead when secondary user switches from one frequency subband to another. Hereinafter, this penalty is referred to as subband switching cost (SSC) [6,7]. The total number of subband switchings and hence, SSC should be as small as possible, especially for the resource-constrained battery-operated secondary user terminals. Though the challenges of minimizing the collisions among secondary users are attracting much attention in the research community today, the design of decentralized DSLA scheme with additional constraints of tunable vacant bandwidth and minimum SSC for heterogeneous CRNs has yet to be systematically addressed. The stringent hardware specifications of minimum area and power make the design even more challenging and are the motivations behind the work presented in this paper. The proposed decentralized DSLA scheme consists of:•A low complexity interpolation and modified frequency transformation based variable digital filter (IMFT-VDF). It provides tunable bandpass responses anywhere over Nyquist band with complete control over the bandwidth as well as the center frequency and offers total gate count savings from 11% to as high as 87% over other VDFs and filter banks.Conventional energy detector.A proposed tunable decision making policy,ρt_rand, for orthogonalization of secondary users to access optimum subbands. The proposed policy,ρt_rand, differs from existing Multi-Armed Bandit and randomization based policy,ρrand[8], in two ways: 1)ρt_randincorporates an efficient approach to accurately and quickly identify the optimum subset of contiguous, orthogonal vacant subbands of any desired bandwidth from a large number of non-orthogonal subbands that can be filtered using the IMFT-VDF, 2) Inρt_rand, the size of the subband subset is made tunable, as a function of the learned subband vacancy statistics, desired vacant bandwidth and the estimated probability of collisions, compared to a fixed subset size inρrand. Both refinements lead to fewer number of collisions and hence, lower SSC.The simulation results support our claims about the superiority of the proposed decentralized DSLA scheme over the existing decentralized DSLA schemes in terms of spectrum utilization efficiency and SSC. Note that the proposed scheme is not just a straightforward integration of the VDF and existing policyρrand. In fact, it is designed by exploiting the exclusive unabridged center frequency control offered by the IMFT-VDF and adapting theρrandto efficiently work with the IMFT-VDF.The work presented in this paper is a significant extension of our preliminary works in [12,15]. For instance, the proposed IMFT-VDF offers complete control over the bandwidth as well as center frequency of bandpass responses compared to the coarse and limited control offered by our VDF in [15]. Furthermore, the design, architecture as well as gate count complexity are discussed in detail in this paper. Our DSLA scheme in [12] was designed for CRNs consisting of single secondary user, which is now extended for more practical and challenging scenarios of multi-standard multi-user CRNs.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The details of network model and the literature review of different stages of DSLA scheme are presented in Section 2. In Section 3, the design and architecture of the proposed IMFT-VDF are discussed along with suitable design examples and gate count complexity comparisons. The proposed policy,ρt_rand, is presented in Section 4 followed by the simulation results and complexity comparisons in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.Consider the slotted CRN consisting of M secondary users. The desired vacant bandwidth of any kth secondary user is denoted byBv(k),k∈{1,2,..,M}. The wideband input signal consists of at mostNpactive primary users with channel bandwidths,Bp(j),j∈{1,2,..,Np}, which are integer multiples of the smallest channel bandwidth,Bcminsuch thatNc=(1/Bcmin),∑jBp(j)≤1andM<Nc. Note that all the frequency specifications are normalized with respect to half the sampling frequency. LetPvac(i),i∈{1,2,..,Nc}be the probability of vacancy for each subband of bandwidthBcmin. It is assumed to evolve as an i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) Bernoulli random process with time, t, stationary and unknown to secondary users [8–14].Within each secondary user, DSLA scheme can be implemented through filtering stage, detection stage and decision making stage as illustrated in Fig. 1[12]. Depending on the desired vacant bandwidth,Bv(k), the decision making stage of corresponding kth secondary user instructs the filtering stage to extract the desired frequency subband of interest via parameters,Bv(k)andfcenter(k)(for center frequency). The extracted subband is then sensed using an imperfect detector i.e., sensing errors may occur. Due to resource and hardware constraints of secondary user terminal, it is assumed that each secondary user can sense only one subband at a time.WhenBv(k)=Bcmin, then the corresponding kth secondary user can choose any one ofNr(k)=Ncorthogonal subbands. However, whenBv(k)>Bcmin, the number of subbands choices for the corresponding kth secondary user areNr(k)=[Nc+1−⌈(Bv(k)/Bcmin)⌉]non-orthogonal subbands. When multiple secondary users transmit on the non-orthogonal subbands, collision occurs and no user is able to transmit successfully. When no collision occurs and the subband is vacant, it is assumed that the secondary user transmits successfully and gets a reward,rt(k)=⌈(Bv(k)/Bcmin)⌉∀k.LetTlk,k(t)denote the number of time slots where the subbandlk∈{1,2,..,Nr(k)}is sensed by kth secondary user in t slots. Then,∑lkTlk,k(t)=t. LetXlk,k(t)denote the number of time slots up to t slots during which transmission overlkth subband by kth user is successful. LetSt⁎andStdenote the total rewards of the genie-aided policy and the decentralized DSLA policy, respectively. Here, a genie-aided policy means the one where subband vacancy statistics are known a priori and a central unit allocates the secondary users to the M orthogonal optimum subbands. Then, the total regret (i.e., loss due to the selection of occupied subbands and collisions among secondary users),Ut, of the CRN up to time t is given by Eq. (1)[8–11] and it should be as small as possible.(1)Ut=St⁎−St=∑k=1M∑x=0t−1[rx⁎(k)−rx(k)]Next, the filtering and decision making stages of decentralized DSLA scheme are discussed in detail.The task of the filtering stage is to extract the frequency subband of any desired bandwidth,Bv(k)and center frequency,fcenter(k). The filtering task is done jointly in the analog front-end and digital front-end of user terminal. Taking into account inter-standard as well as intra-standard channel bandwidth variations and limited flexibility of analog filters compared to its digital counterpart, the analog front-end performs only coarse filtering task and the digital front-end is responsible for the stringent subband filtering task. The digital filtering stage is realized either using digital filter or filter bank such as memory based filters, VDFs, discrete Fourier transform filter bank (DFTFB), fast filter bank etc. [15–29].The filter bank [27–29] and multiple detectors based decentralized DSLA schemes allow quick learning and access to the optimum vacant subband of desired bandwidth, since multiple subbands can be sensed simultaneously. Though such schemes are popularly used in base station receivers, they do not offer an area and power efficient solution for battery-operated resource-constrained secondary user terminals. This is because, the smaller the value of desired subband bandwidthBv(k), higher is the desired resolution (i.e. number of subbands) and hence, higher is the gate count complexity of the filter bank. Furthermore, such terminals can afford only one detector due to the imposed power constraints for longer battery life and hence, only one subband or multiple contiguous subbands in conjunction can be sensed at a time. Since, the other extracted subbands are not used, filter bank is not utilized to its full potential. Also, filter banks are not efficient for wideband input signal with non-contiguous bandwidth. In such cases, VDFs offer an efficient alternative.In memory based digital FIR filters, filter coefficients corresponding to all desired bandpass response specifications are stored in memory beforehand. Such filter based scheme is area and power efficient for secondary user terminals due to fewer number of multipliers and adders. However, filter coefficients need to be updated frequently wheneverBv(k)and/orfcenter(k)changes, which incurs huge penalty in terms of sensing time due to multiple memory read/write operations. Higher sensing time means less time for data communication and hence, lower spectrum throughput. Furthermore, memory size increases with the increase in the granularity ofBv(k)andfcenter(k)and is very large. As a result, DSLA using memory based FIR filter is suitable for CRN supporting single communication standard, i.e.,Bv(k)is fixed andfcenter(k)is limited to a set of fewer discrete values.The VDF provides on-the-fly control overBv(k)andfcenter(k)of the bandpass response through a small number of parameters [15–26]. The design of linear phase bandpass VDF for decentralized DSLA is a challenging research problem and highly nontrivial because of the fixed transition bandwidth (TBW) requirement as well as area, power and delay constraints.A number of bandpass VDF designs are available in the literature [15–26]. The allpass transformation (APT) based VDF [23] offers complete control over the center frequency of bandpass responses but the phase is non-linear which limits its usefulness in DSLA scheme. The frequency response masking based VDFs [16] offer complete control over the cut-off frequency of lowpass responses and are suitable for applications requiring sharp TBW. However, their usefulness in the case of bandpass responses with complete control overBv(k)andfcenter(k)has not been explored and the group delay of the [16] is very high. The first and second order frequency transformation based VDFs [15,17,18] and coefficient decimation method (CDM) based VDFs [24] offer only coarse control over theBv(k)andfcenter(k). The spectral parameter approximation based VDFs (SPA-VDFs) [19–21] have the advantages of fixed TBW, fewer variable multipliers and lower group delay. However, the gate count complexity of these VDFs is very high and large dynamic range of filter coefficients may impose constraints when fixed-point implementation is desired. Though the SPA-VDF in [19] and our SPA-MCDM-VDF [20] overcome some of these drawbacks, their gate count complexity is still high.Various decision making policies have been proposed for the decentralized DSLA in single user as well as multi-user CRNs [6–14]. These policies have shown to outperform the conventional random selection based policies under self-play i.e. when implemented at all secondary users [6–14]. They mainly differ in the type of online learning algorithms they employ for decision making such as ε-greedy algorithm, Multi-Armed Bandit based upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms such asUCB1,UCBH,UCBt,UCBvetc. [12–14] or combination of these algorithms [10] as well as different strategies for orthogonalization of secondary users [8–11]. Analytically, the UCB based algorithms [13,14] are mathematically proved to be optimal with logarithmic regret bound, which is the best we can expect when secondary users do not have any information aboutPvac(i)∀i. Hence, the discussion in this paper is limited to the UCB algorithm.The direct application of UCB algorithm for single user CRN (M=k=1) is discussed in [6,7,12–14]. In brief, secondary user sequentially but randomly senses allNr(1)subbands once at the beginning. Then, fort>Nr(1), the subband,It(1), with the maximum value of g-statistic,Bl1,1(t), is chosen [13]. The g-statistic,Bl1,1(t), for channell1and time t is the sum of the learned mean availability of the subband,X¯l1,1(t)(exploitation factor) and UCB-bias,Al1,1(t)(exploration factor) [13]. Mathematically [13],(2)It(1)=arg⁡maxl1Bl1,1(t)where(3)Bl1,1(t)=Xl1,1(t)Tl1,1(t)︸X¯l1,1(t)+2⋅ln⁡(t)Tl1,1(t)︸Al1,1(t)∀l1In [12], we proposed DSLA scheme using UCB to support the tunable vacant bandwidth requirements for CRNs with single secondary user.For practical scenario where CRN consists of M (>1) secondary users, notable research on the integration of learning algorithms such as UCB algorithm with different access strategies for orthogonalization of secondary users to optimum subbands has been pursued in [8–11].In particular, theρrandpolicy in [8], achieves orthogonalization by randomly and independently assigning rank to each secondary user. For example, kth secondary user with the rank,pk∈{1,2,..M}, selects the subband havingpkth maximum value of g-statistic,Blk,k(t). When collision occurs, the corresponding secondary users randomly and independently change their rank. Another access policy in [9] follows time division fare share approach where the rank of each secondary user is not fixed but is updated in round robin fashion to allow equal access to optimum subbands among all secondary users. Analytically, both the policies are simple, order-optimal and their regret,Ut, is logarithmic with time t. However, the SSC of the policy in [9] increases linearly with t since each secondary user switches the subband in each time slot compared to the policy in [8] where subband switching occurs only when secondary user experiences collision. Thus, policy in [8] is preferred over the policy in [9].The mixed strategy based policy in [10] employs soft-max action selection method that uses the Boltzmann distribution. The performance of this method is similar to [8] but its SSC is high and convergence has not been proved analytically. The policy in [11] is designed by combining access strategies in [8,9] with two learning algorithms to take into account differentPvacdistributions. However, the SSC of [11] is high for thePvacdistributions where it performs better than [8]. The proposed policy is discussed later in Section 4.The IMFT-VDF is the first contribution of this paper and constitutes the filtering stage of the proposed decentralized DSLA scheme shown in Fig. 1.Consider a linear-phase prototype lowpass filter,H(Z), of order 2N and symmetric filter coefficientshn,n∈{0,1,..,2N}, i.e.,hn=h2N−n∀n. The transfer function of the prototype filter,H(Z), in Taylor form is given as [17],(4)H(Z)=∑n=0NanZ−N[Z+Z−12]where the coefficientsanare related to the impulse response coefficientshnthrough the Chebyshev polynomials [17]. The second order frequency transformation based VDF,H2(z), is then given by [17],(5)H2(z)=∑n=0NanZ−ND(z)whereZ→zrepresents the frequency transformation [17]. The termD(z)denotes the second order frequency transformation and is given by [17],(6)D(z)=Z+Z−12=∑v=02Av(z+z−12)vwhereAv,v∈{0,1,2}, are the controlling parameters ofD(z)and they decide the cut-off frequency and the TBW of theH2(z)[17]. Substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (5), we get(7)H2(Z)=∑n=0Nanz−2(N−n)[∑v=02Avzv−2(1+z−22)v]nLetωcandΩcbe the cut-off frequencies of theH(Z)andH2(z), respectively. Similarly,TBWpandTBW2ftare the TBW of theH(Z)andH2(z), respectively. Then,ΩcandTBW2ftare given by [17],(8)Ωc=cos−1⁡(−A1±A12−4A2(A0−cos⁡ωc)2A2)(9)TBW2ft=TBWp⋅(A1sin⁡Ωc+A2sin⁡(2Ωc)sin⁡ωc)if the following constraints are met [17]:(10a)A0+A1+A2=1(10b)0≤A1≤1(10c)A12−4A2(1−A1−A2−cos⁡ωc)≥0In [17],A1=1and hence, according to Eq. (10a),A2=−A0, which eventually leads to reduction in the number of variable multipliers from 3 to 1. However, the detailed analysis of Eq. (8) and Eq. (10) indicate that, by restrictingA1=1, the cut-off frequency range ofH2(z)is limited to approximately 25% of the Nyquist band. This in turn narrows the bandwidth and the center frequency range of the bandpass responses. Our modified second order frequency transformation based VDF in [15] allowsA1to take any reciprocal of power-of-two value instead of unity. The resultant VDF is then combined with the CDM to obtain variable lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop responses from a fixed-coefficient lowpass prototype filter. However, it cannot provide complete control over the center frequency and the bandwidth of the bandpass response over the entire Nyquist band. Furthermore, the TBW deteriorates significantly at higher cut-off frequencies. To overcome these drawbacks, especially for the DSLA application, a new IMFT-VDF based on the modified frequency transformation and interpolation technique is proposed. The main differences between IMFT-VDF and our VDF in [15] are:1.The parameterA1is tunable as against to fixedA1in [15] but restricted to the reciprocal of power-of-two values and zero.The architecture consists of two branches ofD(z)(discussed in detail later in Section 3.3) compared to single branch ofD(z)in [15].The VDF in [15] is combined with the CDM to obtain variable bandpass responses from variable lowpass responses. In IMFT-VDF, the interpolation and conventional lowpass to highpass conversion by reversing the sign of every alternate coefficient are used to increase the tunable cut-off frequency range of lowpass responses.Consider the design of the IMFT-VDF which provides complete control over the cut-off frequency of lowpass response fromΩc1toΩc2with the desired TBW ofTBWd, desired passband and stopband ripples ofδpdandδsd, respectively. The desired bandpass response with lower and upper cut-off frequenciesΩbpc1andΩbpc2, respectively, is obtained by subtracting a lowpass response with cut-off frequency ofΩbpc1from another lowpass response with cut-off frequency ofΩbpc2using the same prototype filter and two branches ofD(z). Without loss of generality, we haveΩbpc1≥Ωc1,Ωbpc2≤Ωc2,Ωc1≈0andΩc2≈1. The design steps of IMFT-VDF are:1.TheΩˆc1is chosen such thatΩˆc1=min⁡{Ωc1,(1−Ωc2)}andΩˆc2=(1−Ωˆc1)to maintain the symmetry with respect to center of the Nyquist band.The lowpass cut-off frequency range fromΩˆc1toΩˆc2is divided into two equal parts: a)Ωˆc1to 0.5, b) 0.5 toΩˆc2.For the desired frequency specifications ofTBWd,δpdandδsd, the cut-off frequency of the prototype filter,ωc, the parametersA1andA2are chosen using Eq. (8)–(10) such that lowpass responses with desired frequency specifications and cut-off frequency range fromΩ¯c1to 0.5 are obtained. This is a simple optimization problem to obtainΩ¯c1to be as close toΩˆc1as possible with the constraints of meeting the desired frequency specifications.WhenΩ¯c1≤Ωˆc1, interpolation is not required. Otherwise, lowpass responses with cut-off frequencyΩcwhereΩˆc1≤Ωc≤Ω¯c1orΩ¯c2(=1−Ω¯c1)≤Ωc≤Ωˆc2are obtained using conventional interpolation technique. Corresponding interpolation factor isp≈(Ω¯c1/Ωˆc1)such thatp∈{2,4,8...}and masking filter,Hm(z), is required to mask the undesired subbands.Finally, the lowpass response with0.5≤Ωc≤Ω¯c2is obtained from the corresponding lowpass response with cut-off frequency of (1−Ωc) by changing the sign of every alternate filter coefficients and then taking the complementary response. Note thatΩ¯c1≤(1−Ωc)≤0.5.The IMFT-VDF is not just a straightforward integration of the frequency transformation and interpolation. In fact, the IMFT-VDF is carefully designed by exploiting the architectural advantages such as lower deterioration in TBW and lower multiplier complexity of the proposed second order modified frequency transformation as well as exclusive multiband response capability of the conventional interpolation technique, without compromising on the total gate counts. The architecture of the IMFT-VDF is discussed in the next section.The architecture of the IMFT-VDF is shown in Fig. 2where the modified second order frequency transformation is realized throughD(z)shown in Fig. 3. The IMFT-VDF architecture consists of prototype filter of order 2N with coefficients,a0,a1,..,aN, obtained from the original filter coefficients,h0,h1,..h2N, as discussed in Section 3.2. These coefficients are fixed and can be hardwired. In the IMFT-VDF architecture, the Taylor structure of filter implementation is re-designed by shifting eachD(z)block adjacent to the corresponding delay block. This is done to obtain multiple lowpass responses, each with distinct cut-off frequency, using single fixed-coefficient prototype filter and multiple branches ofD(z). The proposed structure is referred to as transposed Taylor structure. Even though the number of delay blocks are higher in the transposed Taylor structure compared to conventional Taylor structure [17], the total group delay of both structures is equal for a given N. Moreover, in the FPGA implementation of the VDF, delays can be implemented without significant hardware cost.TheD(z)is given by,(11)D(z)=A0z−2+A1(1+z−22)+A2(1+z−22)2From Eq. (10a), we haveA0=1−A1−A2. Substituting this relationship into Eq. (11) and simplifying, we obtain(12)D(z)=z−2+A1[(1+z−22)z−1−z−2]+A2[(1+z−22)2−z−2]Using Eq. (12) and interpolation factor p,D(z)can be efficiently implemented as shown in Fig. 3.The IMFT-VDF comprises of two parallel branches ofD(z), controlled via signalsSxp,Cxn,A1xandA2xwherex∈{1,2}. Each branch provides either lowpass response (whenp=1) or multiband response (whenp>1) depending on the value of correspondingSxp.A1xandA2xcontrol the values of parametersA1andA2, respectively.Cxncontrols adder–subtractor block whereCxn=1corresponds to the addition andCxn=−1corresponds to the subtraction. In general,Cxn=(−1)nwhen the desired cut-off frequency lies in the range 0.5 toΩ¯c2. Otherwise,Cxn=1∀n. The outputs of these two branches,y1andy2, are given to the output logic unit.The output logic unit is depicted in Fig. 4. It consists ofNmth (Nm≪N) order fixed-coefficient masking filter,Hm(z), to mask the undesired subbands in multiband response when p> 1 as discussed in Section 3.2. The cut-off frequency, TBW, passband and stopband ripples ofHm(z)are(1/p),2[(1/p)−Ω¯c1−(0.5⋅TBWd)],δpdandδsd, respectively. The masking filter outputs are denoted by l (response obtained using lowpass masking filter with cut-off frequency of(1/p)), h (response obtained using highpass masking filter with cut-off frequency of[1−(1/p)]),hc(response obtained using lowpass masking filter with cut-off frequency of[1−(1/p)]), and I (appropriately delayed version of input signal). In Fig. 4,y1cis a complementary response ofy1obtained by subtractingy1from an appropriately delayed version of the input signal.The multiplexer control signal, sel_y, is a 6 bit signal which controls two 2:1 multiplexers and two 4:1 multiplexers as shown in Fig. 4. The IMFT-VDF architecture provides variable lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop responses using fixed-coefficient lowpass filter. The control signals to obtain variable bandpass responses are given in Table 1where “X” denotes “don't care” condition. Similarly, variable lowpass responses can be obtained using only a single branch ofD(z)with outputy2. The corresponding values of sel_y are{101100,101111,101111,101110}for cut-off frequency lying in the rangeΩˆc1toΩ¯c1,Ω¯c1to 0.5, 0.5 toΩ¯c2andΩ¯c2toΩˆc2, respectively. The bandstop and highpass responses can be obtained as the complementary responses of the corresponding bandpass and lowpass responses.Consider the design of the VDF withTBWd≤0.06π,δsd=−50dBandδpd=0.1dBthat provides complete control over the bandwidth as well as the center frequency of bandpass responses over the desired range fromΩc1=0.05πtoΩc2=0.95π. For these frequency specifications, the IMFT-VDF is designed withN=42,ωc=0.25π,A1∈{0,0.25,0.5,1}andp∈{1,2}whereΩ¯c1=0.1πandΩ¯c2=0.9π. The illustrative lowpass responses obtained using the IMFT-VDF are shown in Fig. 5via different colors. The responses shown by black color are obtained withA1=1, i.e. conventional second order frequency transformation [17]. The responses shown in blue color are obtained usingA1≠1i.e., the proposed second order modified frequency transformation. The frequency responses in red and green colors are obtained using interpolation technique. Since the bandpass responses can be easily obtained by arithmetic subtraction of lowpass responses as discussed in Section 3.3, we can say that IMFT-VDF offers complete control over the bandwidth as well as the center frequency of bandpass responses.A 16 × 16 bit multiplier, a 4:1 multiplexer, a 2:1 multiplexer, 32 bit adder and a word of memory were synthesized on a TSMC 65 nm process. The Synopsys Design Compiler was used to estimate the cell area. The area in terms of gate count is obtained by normalizing the cell area values by that of a two input NAND gate from the same library. The total gate count is the sum of gate counts of all the components. For the design examples withTBWd=0.06πandTBWd=0.01πwithδsd=−50dBandδpd=0.1dB, the gate count requirements of memory based FIR filter, MCDM-VDF [24], non-linear phase APT-CDM-VDF [23], SPA-VDF [19], SPA-MCDM-VDF [20] and IMFT-VDF are given in Table 2. The term “NLP” in Table 2 stands for non-linear phase.For the first design example, the order of an FIR filter is 90 and coefficients corresponding to different bandpass responses are stored in memory beforehand. The MCDM-VDF consists of prototype filter of order 2000 and decimation factor, D, varies from 1 to 25. Our APT-CDM-VDF consists of prototype filter of order 160 and variable responses are obtained by integrating the first order APT with the reduced second order APT. The SPA-VDF consists of 2 subsets of 6 sub-filters, each of order 90. Our SPA-MCDM-VDF consists of 6 sub-filters each of order 90 and a masking filter of order 14.The IMFT-VDF offers total gate count savings of{30%,87%,18%,60%,37%}and{22%,78%,11%,55%,27%}over FIR filter, MCDM-VDF [24], APT-CDM-VDF [23], SPA-VDF [19] and SPA-MCDM-VDF [20] for the first and second design examples, respectively. The group delay of the IMFT-VDF is slightly higher than other VDFs. However, it must be taken into account that the total latency of the physical layer in each secondary user terminal is small compared to the latency of the CRNs [6,7]. This means that little penalty in group delay is acceptable for more than 27% savings in total gate count. For delay sensitive applications, our SPA-MCDM-VDF [20] offers good alternative at the cost of higher gate count.The second contribution of this paper is a tunable decision making policy,ρt_rand, designed to take full advantage of exclusive bandwidth and center frequency control offered by IMFT-VDF. The objective is to strike a balance between the number of collisions among secondary users and the total time spent on the non-optimum subbands, in order to achieve lower regret,Stas well as lower SSC for different distributions ofPvac(i)∀iand distinctBv(k)∀krequirements in heterogeneous decentralized CRNs. It is assumed that all secondary users employ the same policy but do not exchange any information with other users.The advantages and disadvantages of different policies are discussed in Section 2.2. Accordingly, the proposed policy,ρt_rand, is designed via three refinements to existing policy,ρrand[8], which are: 1) Low complexity tunable filtering stage (discussed in Section 4.1), 2) An efficient approach to identify the optimum subset of contiguous orthogonal subbands (discussed in Section 4.2), 3) Tunable subset size (discussed in Section 4.3).In the literature, the input signal scenarios withNc≤16are considered. As per the assumption of stationary vacant subband statistics, the subband bandwidth must be narrow which means that the total bandwidth of the input signal, whenNc≤16, is not sufficiently wide. On the other hand, the practical scenarios usually involve wideband input signal and the requirement of tunableBv(k)indicates largeNc(≫16).When the filtering stage of each secondary user is implemented using filter bank, the desired resolution (i.e., number of subbands) of the filter bank is equal to (1/Bv(k)). For example, ifNc=16andBv(k)=Bcmin(orBv(k)=2⋅Bcmin, respectively), then 16 subband (or 8 subband, respectively) filter bank is required. To support tunable bandwidth requirement, an efficient approach would be to implementNcsubband filter bank and then, (Nc/2), (Nc/4) or (Nc/8) subband filter bank responses can be obtained by combining adjacent subbands. However, higher the value ofNc, higher the resolution and hence the gate count, power consumption as well as group delay of the filter bank are. Hence, filter bank is not an area and power efficient choice whenNcis large (≫16). We propose a low complexity solution by replacing the filter bank with the IMFT-VDF. The gate count, power consumption and group delay of the IMFT-VDF are independent ofNcandBv(k).In the existing policies [8–11,13,14], it is assumed that,Bv(k)=Bcmin, ∀k, and hence,Nr(k)=Nc∀k, i.e., all the subbands are orthogonal. This means that the performance of existing schemes [8–11,13,14] under tunable vacant bandwidth requirements (Bv(k)>Bcmin) and wideband input signal scenarios (Nc≫16) has not been analyzed yet.Consider an input signal bandwidth B as shown in Fig. 6. It is divided into 16 (=Nc) uniform subbands, each with bandwidthBcmin=B/16andPvac(i),i∈{1,2,..16}. WhenBv(k)>Bcmin, then the corresponding subbands of bandwidthBv(k)are non-orthogonal. For example, ifBv(k)=2⋅Bcmin∀k, then there are 15 non-orthogonal subbands of bandwidthBv(k). Since each subband overlaps in frequency with at most[2⋅(⌈Bv(k)/Bcmin⌉−1)]number of other subbands of bandwidthBv(k), clustering of non-orthogonal subbands into different subsets is necessary to reduce the number of collisions among secondary users. Furthermore, quick and accurate selection of the optimum subset will lead to smaller total regret,Ut, and the SSC. For example, let us consider the two possible subsets of orthogonal subbands whenBv(k)=2⋅Bcmin:{(1–2),(3–4),...,(15–16)}or{(2–3),(4–5),...,(14–15)}. Using the relationP(AB)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A)⋅P(B), corresponding combined probability of vacancies are obtained as{0.39,0.11,0.19,0.52,0.62,0.36,0.87,0.28}and{0.14,0.03,0.21,0.8,0.06,0.59,0.84}, respectively. It can be easily observed that the second subset has higher number of optimum subbands than the first for this design example considered here. Thus, timely selection of the second subset will definitely lead to the lower regret,Ut.The IMFT-VDF, due to its finer granularity of center frequency of bandpass responses, offers large number of subsets of orthogonal contiguous subbands. Higher the number of subsets, higher is the time spent in the non-optimum subbands and hence, higher is the regret,Ut. Thus, the number of subbands choices are limited to two in the proposed policy where the first subset starts with the subband numbered as 1 while the second subset starts with the subband numbered as(⌈Bv(k)/2⋅Bcmin⌉+1), except the caseBv(k)=Bcminwhere only one subset is available. The idea behind such subset division is to keep less than 50% overlapping between the corresponding subbands of two subsets so that the subsets are sufficiently apart in terms of their combined vacancy statistics which in turn leads to fewer errors in the selection of optimal subset by secondary users.In the proposedρt_randpolicy, all M secondary users independently learn the vacancy statistics of these two subsets during initial phase spanning up tots(k)time slots. This means that the secondary user spends half the number of time slots, i.e., (ts(k)/2) slots, in the first subset and remaining half in other subset. Then, att=ts(k)+1, secondary user independently choses the optimum subset based on the past sensing events. The number of time slots,ts(k), needs to be chosen carefully since very small or very large value ofts(k)would lead to the higherUtas well as higher SSC as discussed before. Based on empirical observations, we have,(13)ts(k)=2λ⋅Lt(k),∀kwhereLt(k)is the tunable subset size for kth user (discussed in Section 4.3) and λ is a constant between 5 to 10.In the existing policies for multi-user CRNs [8–11], the size of the subset, comprising of optimum subbands, is fixed, i.e.,Lt(k)=M∀k. This means that the distinct and tunable vacant bandwidth requirements of each secondary user as well as the different types of distributions ofPvacare not taken into consideration while choosingLt(k). Also, the number of collisions and hence, SSC are bound to be large in the beginning as well as for higher M since it is unlikely that secondary users will always agree on the order of the optimum subbands [8,9]. The solution to these issues can be provided by making the subset size,Lt(k)∀k, tunable as discussed below.The minimum and maximum subset sizes,Ltmin(k)andLtmax(k), respectively, for kth secondary user are given by,(14)Ltmin(k)=(∑u=1M⌈Nc⋅Bv(u)⌉⌈Nc⋅Bv(k)⌉)(15)Ltmax(k)=(Nc⋅BcminBv(k)−e)wheree=1if the first subset is chosen, i.e.sub(k)=1, otherwisee=0. It can be observed thatLtmin(k)=Ltmax(k)=MwhenBv(k)=Bcmin∀k, same as that in [8–11].IfLt(k)≈Ltmin(k), then the number of collisions among secondary users,Utand SSC are all high. On the other hand, very large value ofLt(k)≈Ltmax(k), offers lesser number of collisions and lower SSC, but leads to higher regretUtdue to the selection of the sub-optimum subbands i.e. the subbands with lowerPvac. By taking into account the fact that theUtand SSC due to the collisions are much worse than the same due to the selection of the sub-optimum subbands in the DSLA scenario compared to conventional machine learning scenarios, a new method to make the value ofLt(k)∀ktunable is proposed as follows:1.For each integer value fromLtmin(k)toLtmax(k), the total predicted reward,S˜t(k,qk)∀kandqk∈{1,2,..,(Ltmax(k)−Ltmin(k)+1)}, at any given time t, are calculated as,(16)S˜t(k,qk)=∑u=1Ltmin(k)+qk−1P¯vac(k,jk,u)⋅Ltmin(k)Ltmin(k)+qk−1where(17)jk,u=(sub(k)+(u−1)⋅⌈Bv(k)Bcmin⌉)HereP¯vac(k,jk,u)∀udenote the learned subband availability statistics arranged in the descending order, i.e.,P¯vac(k,1)≥P¯vac(k,2)≥⋯≥P¯vac(k,Ltmax(k)).For each integer value fromLtmin(k)toLtmax(k), the total predicted number of collisions,C˜t(k,qk)∀kand∀qk, at any given time t, are calculated as(18)C˜t(k,qk)=1−[(Ltmin(k)+qk−1)!(qk−1)!(Ltmin(k)+qk−1)Ltmin(k)]Finally, the optimum value ofLt(k)is given by(19)Lt(k)=Ltmin(k)+s−1where(20)s=arg⁡maxqk[S˜t(k,qk)⋅t−C˜t(k,qk)⋅t]Each secondary user independently calculates the value ofLt(k). To minimize the computational complexity, the value ofLt(k)is updated only when corresponding secondary user experiences collision with other secondary users. The proposed learning policy,ρt_rand, is described in detail in Algorithm 1.In this section, we presents the simulation results and compare the performances of the proposed decentralized DSLA scheme (IMFT-VDF andρt−rand) with the existing decentralized schemes (DFTFB andρrand[8]) in terms of total vacant spectrum utilization (average reward), SSC and gate count complexity. The wideband input signal consists of 128 (=Nc) subbands i.e.,Bcmin=(1/128). Three different resolutions of DFTFB,{128,64,32}are considered. Each numerical result reported hereafter is the average of the values obtained over 50 independent experiments and the simulations consider a time horizon of 50000 iterations.ConsiderBv(k)>Bcmin∀kandBv(1)=...=Bv(M). This scenario is similar to the one considered in the existing literature in the sense that the vacant bandwidth requirement of all users is identical. In Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b, the plots of average reward,St, in percentage vs. time t, are shown for two different types of input distributions, case 1 (C1) and case 2 (C2), respectively. Here,M=25,Bv(k)=0.012∀kandSt%=[100⋅(St⁎−St)/St⁎]whereSt⁎is the average reward of the genie-aided policy (i.e., centralized DSLA). It can be observed that the total reward (vacant spectrum utilization) of the proposed scheme is higher than other schemes. In Fig. 7e, the plot of average reward att=20000is plotted for different values of M. It can be observed that the proposed scheme outperforms other schemes for all M. Furthermore, the proposed scheme offers 15% and 26% lower average SSC than 128-DFTFB based scheme for case 1 and case 2, respectively.Next, we consider the scenario where the desired vacant bandwidth is not same for all users i.e.,Bv(k)≥Bcmin∀k. In Fig. 7c and Fig. 7d, the plots of average reward,St, in percentage vs. time slot t, are shown for case 1 and case 2, respectively. Here,M=25with the desired bandwidth of first 4 users is (1/256), next 2 users is (2/256), next 8 users is (3/256), next 3 users is (5/256) and (6/256) for the last user. It can be observed that the total reward (vacant spectrum utilization) of the proposed scheme is higher than other schemes. In Fig. 7f, the plot of average reward att=20000is plotted for different values of M. It can be observed that the proposed scheme outperforms other schemes for all M. Furthermore, the proposed scheme offers 8% and 17% lower average SSC than 128-DFTFB based scheme for case 1 and 2, respectively. The simulation results presented here are more realistic compared to those in the existing literature, sinceNcis very large and the desired vacant bandwidths,Bv(k)∀k, of secondary users are not constrained toBcmin. In addition, the scenarios of different distributions ofPvac(i)∀iare considered.The total gate counts of 128-DFTFB and 64-DFTFB for the desired specifications ofTBWd=0.06π,δsd=−50dBandδpd=0.1dB, which corresponds to the prototype filter of order 90, are 1 925 070 and 873 230, respectively. Then, according to Table 2, the IMFT-VDF, with total gate counts of 465 385, offers 76% and 47% saving over 128-DFTFB and 64-DFTFB, respectively. However, the group delay of IMFT-VDF is 104 which is higher than the group delay of 45 in case of DFTFBs.In this paper, a low complexity and efficient dynamic spectrum learning and access (DSLA) scheme for next-generation heterogeneous decentralized cognitive radio networks is proposed. The proposed decentralized DSLA scheme consists of new low complexity modified second order frequency transformation and interpolation technique based variable digital filter and tunable decision making policy,ρt_rand. The simulation results and gate count complexity analysis verifies the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing schemes. The future research direction includes the efficient implementation of the proposed scheme on the USRP-GNU-FPGA platform and analyzing the performance using real radio signals.
