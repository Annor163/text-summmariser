@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We extend a well-known differential oligopoly game to encompass the possibility for production to generate a negative environmental externality, regulated through Pigouvian taxation and price caps. We show that, if the price cap is set so as to fix the tolerable maximum amount of emissions, the resulting equilibrium investment in green R&D is indeed concave in the structure of the industry. Our analysis appears to indicate that inverted-U-shaped investment curves are generated by regulatory measures instead of being a ‘natural’ feature of firms’ decisions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The departure point of the analysis illustrated in this paper lies at the intersection between two different debates, one being centered upon the relation between competition and innovation, whose most recent development is known as the Schumpeterian growth theory initiated by Aghion and Howitt (1998), the other belonging to environmental economics and focussing on the optimal design of policy instruments, such as environmental standards, pollution rights and Pigouvian taxation, to stimulate firms’ investments in abatement and/or replacement technologies (for an updated survey, see Lambertini, 2013).The acquired industrial organisation approach to the bearings of market power on the size and pace of technical progress can be traced back to the indirect debate between Schumpeter (1934, 1942) and Arrow and Nelson (1962) on the so-called Schumpeterian hypothesis, which, in a nutshell, says that one should expect to see an inverse relationship between innovation and the intensity of competition or market structure. Irrespective of the nature of innovation (either for cost reductions or for the introduction of new products), a large theoretical literature attains either Schumpeterian or Arrovian conclusion (for exhaustive accounts, see Tirole, 1988; and Reinganum, Schmalensee, & Willig, 1989).11See also Gilbert, Lerner, and Stern (2006), Vives (2008) and Schmutzler (2010) for add-on’s on this discussion, where still the Schumpeter vs Arrow argument is unresolved.That is, partial equilibrium theoretical IO models systematically predict a monotone relationship, in either direction.The picture drastically changes as soon as one takes instead the standpoint of modern growth theory. In particular, Aghion, Bloom, Blundell, Griffith, and Howitt (2005) stress that empirical evidence shows a non-monotone relationship between industry concentration (or, the intensity of market competition) and aggregate R&D efforts: this takes the form of an inverted-U curve, at odds with all existing theoretical IO models; in the same paper, the authors provide a model yielding indeed such a concave result, and fitting the data. A thorough discussion, accompanied by an exhaustive review of the related lively debate, can be found in Aghion, Akcigit, and Howitt (2013).One could say that the inverted-U emerging from data says that Arrow is right for small numbers, while Schumpeter is right thereafter. Alternatively, on the same basis one could also say that neither Arrow nor Schumpeter can match reality, if our interpretation of their respective views is that “competition (resp., monopoly) outperforms monopoly (resp., competition) along the R&D dimension” . Be that as it may, there arises the need of constructing models delivering a non-monotone relationship between some form of R&D (for process, product or environmental-friendly innovations) and the number of firms in the industry.With this purpose in mind, here we extend a noncooperative differential game model dating back to Leitmann and Schmitendorf (1978) and Feichtinger (1983) to describe an industry in which firms sell a homogeneous good and accumulate capacity over time through costly investments; firms’ activities entail polluting emissions hindering welfare, and the government adopts a Pigouvian taxation policy aimed at providing them with an incentive to internalise the environmental externality and therefore undertake R&D projects for pollution abatement. As in the original model, the mark-up is exogenously fixed, and here is thought of as an additional regulatory tool in the hands of the public authority.Our main results can be outlined as follows. First, we show that there exists a unique open-loop equilibrium which is subgame perfect and saddle-point stable, for any pair of policy instruments. Then, taking again the mark-up and tax rate as given, we prove that the aggregate green R&D effort is monotonically increasing in the number of firms, which is a definitely Arrovian result. Subsequently, we endogenise the regulatory toolkit, allowing first the policy-maker to set that Pigouvian tax rate so as to maximise steady state social welfare; in such a case, the aggregate R&D effort is strictly convex in the number of firms. If optimal taxation is accompanied by a mark-up tailored on industry structure so as to limit the overall volume of emissions, then there emerges a general condition on the shape of the price regulation scheme whereby the industry investment is indeed concave w.r.t. the number of firms.The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The setup is laid out in Section 2, while the equilibrium analysis is in Section 3. Section 4 illustrates the design of policy tools and its consequences on aggregate R&D efforts. Concluding remarks are in Section 5.As anticipated in the introduction, here we extend the model introduced by Leitmann and Schmitendorf (1978) and further investigated by Feichtinger (1983), to allow for the presence of an environmental externality and green R&D investments. In the remainder, we will label this framework as the ‘LSF model’ for brevity. The market exists over t ∈ [0, ∞), and, as in Dragone, Lambertini, and Palestini (2010), it is served by N ≥ 1 a priori symmetric firms with individual capacity xi(t) ≥ 0.22In the original formulation of the model, xi(t) is firm i’s sales volume, and ui(t) its advertising investment. However, one can think of these variables as representing, respectively, installed capacity (with each firm selling at full capacity at any time) and the instantaneous investment to increase it.Given a fixed profit margin p ≥ 0, the instantaneous profit of firm i is(1)πi(t)=pxi(t)−ui2(t)2−γki(t)−ki2(t)2−τsi,where γ > 0 is a parameter. Capacity xi(t) changes according to(2)x˙i(t)=ui(t)−δxi(t),where ui(t) is the investment of firm i at time t and δ > 0 is the decay rate of individual capacity. si(t) and ki(t) denote the firm’s polluting emissions and R&D effort respectively, and τ is the tax rate.The emissions of a firm follow the dynamics(3)s˙i(t)=xi(t)−zki−h∑j≠ikj−ηsi(t)where z is a positive parameter, η > 0 is the natural decay rate of emissions, and parameterh∈[0,z)measures the spillover effect received from rivals’ R&D activity.The total instantaneous volume of emissions at the industry level isS(t)=∑i=1Nsi(t). Therefore the social welfare function at any time can be defined as(4)SW(t)=∑i=1Nπi(t)+CS(t)−S(t)+τ∑i=1Nsi(t).Each firm has two control variables, investment in capacity ui(t) and investment in green R&D ki(t). The policy maker has two instruments, the Pigouvian tax rate τ (which may be usefully thought of as incorporating the price of emission rights) and the regulated mark-up p. To avoid time inconsistency issues, we consider the policy menu applied onto the steady state only. The structure of the model identifies a linear state game (it wouldn’t be so if either the policy were function of the state or the demand function were endogenously determined). Therefore, the open-loop solution is subgame perfect, respecting the original LSF formulation.Firm i’s (i=1,…,N) current-value Hamiltonian (from now on we suppress the time argument)33In this respect, a remark is in order: note that, in general, the objective functional πihas to be multiplied by the general multiplier λ0 to allow for the abnormal case (see e.g. Leitmann, 1981). However, in the current model that abnormal case can be ruled out as can be readily shown.(5)Hi(s,x,k,u)=πi+λiix˙i+∑j≠iλijx˙j+μiis˙i+∑j≠iμijs˙jgenerates the following first order conditions (inner solution) for firm i’s (i=1,…,N) controls(6)∂Hi∂ui=λii−ui=0(7)∂Hi∂ki=−γ−ki−zμii−h∑j≠iμij=0Thus we obtain the following optimal controls of firm i (i=1,…,N)(8)ui*(t)=λii(t)ki*(t)=−γ−zμii(t)−h∑j≠iμij(t).Furthermore, each firm i obtains the following dynamic equations for the costates (i,j=1,…,N,i ≠ j)(9)λ˙ii=(ρ+δ)λii−p−μii−∑j≠iμijvλ˙ij=(ρ+δ)λij−∑j≠iμijμ˙ii=(ρ+η)μii+τμ˙ij=(ρ+η)μij.In order to characterize the optimal long run solution of the system we have to derive the equilibria of the above defined system of differential equations (i.e. state and costate equations of all firms). In this model the equilibrium is unique. For the adjoint variables we obtain (i,j=1,…,N, i ≠ j)(10)λ^ii=1ρ+δ(p−τρ+η)λ^ij=0μ^ii=−τρ+ημ^ij=0.Inserting into (8) yields the following equilibrium controls (i=1,…,N)(11)u^i*=1ρ+δ(p−τρ+η)k^i*=zτρ+η−γ.Using these expressions for the state equations we obtain (i=1,…,N)(12)x^i=1δ(ρ+δ)(p−τρ+η)s^i=1η[1δ(ρ+δ)(p−τρ+η)−(zτρ+η−γ)(z+h(N−1))].Since all firms are assumed to be a priori symmetric, we define the steady state values asu^:=u^i,k^:=k^i,x^:=x^iands^:=s^i. Due to the economic meaning of the model, we have to assume that the controls and the states are non-negative for allt∈[0,∞). The following Lemma provides assumptions such that the non-negativity is fulfilled in equilibrium.Lemma 1The steady state variables of the state and control variables of every player i (i=1,…,N) are non-negative if the following assumptions on the parameters are fulfilled(A1)p(ρ+η)≥τ≥γ(ρ+η)z(A2)1h[1δ(ρ+δ)(p−1τρ+η)(zτρ+η−γ)−1−z]+1≥NCondition (A1) guarantees non-negativity of the controls (see (11)). Non-negativity ofx^iis implied by (A1) and that ofs^iby (A2). The analysis of the Jacobian matrix of the system shows thatProposition 2The unique equilibrium(x^,s^,u^*,k^*)is a saddle point.From the adjoint equations it is easy to show thatμij(t)=λij(t)=0. Due to the structure of the system it is possible to derive an analytical expression of the stable path, i.e.(13)xi(t)=x^+(xi0−x^)e−δtsi(t)=s^−(xi0−x^)1η+δ(e−δt−e−ηt)+(si0−s^)e−ηtμii(t)=μ^iiλii(t)=λ^iiNow we are able to define a sufficient assumption that the controls and the states are positive for allt∈[0,∞).Lemma 3Let(A1)and(A2)hold. Then the following assumption is sufficient to ensure that all controls and states are positive over the whole planning horizon.xi0≤x^,si0≤s^,δ≤η.ui*(t)>0andki*(t)>0are trivial by the signs of the adjoint variables in (13). xi(t) > 0 is implied byxi0≤x^(see (13)). For si(t) we obtain from (13)(14)si(t)=s^(1−e−ηt)+si0e−ηt+(x^−xi0)1η+δ(e−δt−e−ηt)Since η > 0 the first and the second term are trivially (strictly) positive. δ ≤ η impliese−δt−e−ηt≥0for all t ≥ 0 (equality is the case only fort=0). Thus also the third term of the above expression for si(t) is non-negative.□The foregoing analysis has a seemingly not-so-intriguing ancillary implication:Corollary 4SinceK*=Nk*is everywhere increasing in N for allτ>(η+ρ)γ/z,the behaviour of aggregate R&D is Arrovian for any given Pigouvian policy allowing for a positive investment.However, there is more to it, which can be shown to emerge as soon as one admits the reasonable possibility for regulation to enter the picture along two dimensions: one is obviously τ, as is usually the case in environmental economics, the other is p, which is a specific feature of the present model. Here, the mark-up is fixed, and this fact can be interpreted as a consequence of a price cap imposed by a public authority. The research question we are about to assess in the following section is the following: is the portfolio of policy instruments {p, τ} going to modify the apparently monotone behaviour of aggregate R&D efforts K* outlined in Corollary 4? And, if so, in what direction?The bearings of p and τ on aggregate R&D incentives can be appreciated by addressing the issue in the following terms. It is already known (see Benchekroun & Long, 1998, 2002, inter alia) that there exists a level of Pigouvian taxation driving the industry to the first best which would be obtained under social planning. Call this tax rate τSP(p, N). This tax rate must maximise the steady state level of the social welfare function, defined as(15)SW*(τ)=Nπ*(τ)+CS*(τ)−N(1−τ)s*(τ)where(16)CS*(τ)=(a−p)Nx*(τ)2is consumer surplus, calculated postulating the existence of a linear and decreasing market demand functionp^=a−Nx*in which a > 0 is consumers’ reservation price; indeed,p^is the price that would prevail if the mark-up were unregulated. Moreover, (15) accounts for the additional fact that the revenue produced by Pigouvian taxation, Nτs*(τ), is redistributed to consumers as a windfall.Then, τSP(p, N) can be easily calculated by solving the necessary condition∂SW*(τ)/∂τ=0,satisfied by the unique tax rate:44The second order condition is satisfied, as∂2SW*(τ)∂τ2=−N(1+(δ+ρ)2z2)(δ+ρ)2(η+ρ)2<0always.(17)τSP(p,N)=(η+ρ)[p(δ−ρ)η−(δ+ρ)(aη−2)+2δ(δ+ρ)2(z+h(N−1))z]2δη[1+(δ+ρ)2z2].Now observe that(18)∂K*(τSP(p,N))∂N=0inN=max{1,N^},N^=2δγη2+4cδ(δ+ρ)2(γη+h−z)+p(ρ−δ)η+(δ+ρ)(aη−2)4hδ(δ+ρ)2z,and(19)∂2K*(τSP(p,N))∂N2=2h(δ+ρ)2z2η[1+(δ+ρ)2z2]>0,showing that, ifN^≥2,then in correspondence ofN^the aggregate R&D level K*(τSP(p, N)) is indeed being minimised. Hence, in this scenario no inverted-U may arise (at most, ifN^is admissible, a U-shaped curve obtains), since:Lemma 5If p is given, the equilibrium aggregate R&D effort is convex in N.On the basis of the above Lemma, it seems that Pigouvian taxation is in itself insufficient to deliver an inverted-U R&D curve: the opposite shape does in fact appear ifN^≥2(if so, then for a limited number of firms the Schumpeterian hypothesis is confirmed, while for sufficiently large number of firms the Arrovian position prevails).What if p is set by the government for some purpose? Suppose first that a public agency is in charge of regulating the mark-up of this industry having in mind objectives such as the entry process, consumer surplus or the volume of industry emissions. Be that as it may, the resulting regulatory measure can be defined asp=p(N),so that the mark-up is a function of industry structure. Substituting p(N) into τSP(p, N), the optimal tax rate is then defined in terms of industry structure (as well as the parameters of the model), and can be relabelled as τSP(N). Then, the aggregate R&D effort at the steady state equilibrium writes as follows:K*(τSP(N))=N[zτSP(N)−γ(ρ+η)]ρ+ηwith(20)∂K*(τSP(N))∂N=zτSP(N)−γ(ρ+η)+Nz·∂τSP(N)/∂Nρ+ηand(21)∂2K*(τSP(N))∂N2=z[2·∂τSP(N)/∂N+N·∂2τSP(N)/∂N2]ρ+ηIf there exists a value of N at which (20) is nil, this is implicitly identified by(22)∂τSP(N)∂N=γ(ρ+η)−zτSP(N)Nz<0aszτSP(N)>γ(ρ+η)in order for the equilibrium R&D effort to be positive. Looking back at (17), it appears that (i) as long as p is not a function of industry structure, ∂τSP(p, N)/∂N > 0; and (ii) the derivative of the optimal tax w.r.t. N may become negative only if p is indeed a decreasing function of N.Then, using (22), (21) becomes:(23)∂2K*(τSP(N))∂N2=2[γ(ρ+η)−zτSP(N)]+zN2·∂2τSP(N)/∂N2N(ρ+η)whose sign determines whether the solution to∂K*(τSP(N))/∂N=0is a maximum or a minimum.A sensible way of modelling the role of price regulation rests on considering that, in general, τSP(p, N) - although maximising steady state social welfare - does not ensure the minimisation of the externality or the attainment of any given capS¯targeted by the public agency in charge of the environmental policy.If indeed the government wants to reduce emissions to a given levelS¯, it must set the regulated price at the level solvingNs*=S¯,which is(24)pSP(S¯)=2S¯δ2η2(1+ς2)+N[2+2δ(h(N−1)+z)(2ς−δΦ)−aηΨ]ηN[1−δz((δ+3ρ)z+h(N−1)(ρ−δ)z)]whereς≡z(δ+ρ),and(25)Φ≡γη+[γη−h(N−1)−z]ς2;Ψ≡1+δς[h(N−1)+z].Price (24) is in fact a function of N and we may further investigate the bearings ofpSP(S¯)on the equilibrium R&D effort of the industry.The adoption of such a regulated price delivers(26)K*(τSP(pSP(S¯),N),pSP(S¯))=[δη2(δ−ρ)S¯−η(az+γ+2zδγς)N+2z(1+δς(z+h(N−1)))N]/η[1+zδ(z(δ+3ρ)−h(N−1)(δ−ρ))].Now we can differentiate K*(·) w.r.t. N, obtaining:(27)∂K*(·)∂N=(Υ1+Υ2)Υ3+Υ4−Υ5ηΥ32whereΥ1≡z(2−aη)−γηΥ2≡2zδς[z+h(N−1)−γN](28)Υ3≡[1+zδ(z(δ+3ρ)−h(N−1)(δ−ρ))]Υ4≡hzδ(δ−ρ)[S¯δη2(δ−ρ)+2Nz(1+z(h(N−1)+z)δ(δ+ρ))]Υ5≡Nhzδη(δ−ρ)[γ+z(a+2δγς)]Then, differentiating (27) w.r.t. N, we have the following:(29)∂2K*(·)∂N2=Υ32Υ2′−2Υ3′(Υ4−Υ5)−Υ3[(Υ1+Υ2)Υ3′−Υ4′+Υ5′]ηΥ33in whichΥj′≡∂Υj′/∂N,j=2,3,4,5.The equation∂K*(·)/∂N=0has two roots:(30)N±=1+1+z2δ(δ+3ρ)hzδ(δ−ρ)±ςΩhz2δ(δ2−ρ2)2where(31)N+−N−=2ςΩhz2δ(δ2−ρ2)>0for all δ > ρ, provided Ω ≥ 0 in such a way thatN±∈R,with(32)Ω≡S¯hzδ2η2(δ−ρ)2+[1+zδ(h(δ−ρ)+z(δ+3ρ))]×[4zδς2−γη(δ−ρ)+z(aηρ−δ(aη−4))−2zγδης(δ2−ρ2)]For future reference, defineΞ≡1+zδ(h(δ−ρ)+z(δ+3ρ))and(33)Λ≡4zδς2−γη(δ−ρ)+z(aηρ−δ(aη−4))−2zγδης(δ2−ρ2),which allw us to formulate the followingLemma 6If δ > ρ, Ω ≥ 0 for allS¯≥max{0,−Ξ·Λhzδ2η2(δ−ρ)2}.If instead δ ∈ (0, ρ), Ω ≥ 0 for allS¯∈[0,Ξ·Λhzδ2η2(δ−ρ)2].Lemma 6 says that (i) if the efficiency of natural carbon sinks is higher than the discount rate, the solutions N± to∂K*(·)/∂N=0are real ifS¯is large enough; (ii) if instead the opposite applies,S¯must be low enough in order forN±∈R.The expressions N± can be substituted into (29) to verify that(34)∂2K*(·)∂N2|N=N+=−42hzδς2ηςΩ<0and(35)∂2K*(·)∂N2|N=N−=42hzδς2ηςΩ>0The foregoing analysis produces the following:Proposition 7If δ ∈ (0, ρ) andS¯∈[0,ΞΛ/(hzδ2η2(δ−ρ)2)],then Ω ≥ 0 andN+<0<N−.In this parameter range, K*(·) is convex in N, taking its unique minimum atN=N−.If instead δ > ρ andS¯≥max{0,−ΞΛ/(hzδ2η2(δ−ρ)2)},then Ω ≥ 0 andN−<0<N+.In this parameter range, K*(·) is concave in N and takes its unique maximum atN=N+. In the remainder of the parameter space,N±∉R.The above Proposition illustrates the existence of parameter constellations wherein the aggregate advertising effort in steady state is non-monotone in the number of firms, taking the form of either a U-shaped curve or an inverted U-shaped curve w.r.t. the number of firms in the industry. However, it is also interesting to single out the regions in which the curve in question is indeed monotone. These are identified in the following:Corollary 8In the parameter regions where Ω < 0,N±∉R,and therefore ∂K*(·)/∂N has the same sign asρ−δ.This entails that K*(·) is monotone in N.This result can be easily proved noting that the coefficient of N2 the numerator of ∂K*(·)/∂N in (27) is indeed2h2z2δ2ς(ρ−δ),while the denominator of ∂K*(·)/∂N, i.e., expressionηΥ32,is positive. Hence, when Ω < 0,•K*(·) decreases monotonically in N for all δ > ρ;K*(·) decreases monotonically in N for all δ ∈ (0, ρ).This concludes the proof.□This amounts to saying that, when Ω < 0, aggregate green R&D has a Schumpeterian (resp., Arrovian) flavour when discounting is low (resp., high) enough.A special case where K*(·) is monotone in N is the following. From (26), we see that ifh=0,then(36)K*(τSP(pSP(S¯),N),pSP(S¯))|h=0=[S¯zδη2(δ−ρ)+2Nz(1+δ(δ+ρ)z2)−Nη(az+γ(1+2z2δ(δ+ρ)))]/[η(1+δz2(δ+3ρ))],which is necessarily monotone in N. In particular:Corollary 9In the special case in which technological spillovers are absent, takeS¯>max×{0,N[η(az+γ(1+2z2δ(δ+ρ)))−2z(1+z2δ(δ+ρ))]zδ(δ−ρ)η2}to ensureK*(·)|h=0>0.Then,∂K*(·)|h=0∂N=2z(1+z2δ(δ+ρ))−η(az+γ(1+2z2δ(δ+ρ)))η(1+z2δ(δ+3ρ))≷0for allη≶η^≡2z(1+z2δ(δ+ρ))az+γ(1+2z2δ(δ+ρ)).Corollary 9 entails that, if the individual firm’s abatement capability is unaffected by the rivals’, the behaviour of aggregate green R&D as N changes is Arrovian (resp., Schumpeterian) if the environment’s recycling rate is sufficiently low (resp., high). i.e., it is as if the industry were complementing the natural absorption activities if the latter are not particurlarly effective (which corresponds to the Arrovian case), and conversely (which instead corresponds to the Schumpeterian case).Now it is appropriate to provide a numerical example illustrating the arising of an inverted U-shaped curve. Fixing parameter valuesa=150;h=1/10;z=2/5;S¯=12×103;(37)δ=2/3;γ=3/2;η=2;ρ=1/10,aggregate R&D steady state investmentK*(τSP(pSP(S¯),N),pSP(S¯))can be drawn as in Fig. 1, where the concavity of industry effort emerges clearly andK*(τSP(pSP(S¯),N),SP(S¯))is maximised atN=N+≃822(whileN−<0). In correspondence of these numerical values,∂p(S¯)/∂N≃−0.0097and from 22 and 23 we have∂τSP(N)/∂N≃−0.0059and∂2K*(·)/∂N2≃−0.0938.Something more can be said about the effects of the size of the population of firms. Concerning the supply side, we have(38)k*(τSP(pSP(S¯),N),SP(S¯))=0atN≃7348x*(τSP(pSP(S¯),N),SP(S¯))=0atN≃7497which implies that there exists a non-negligible range of N, namely, (7349, 7389) in which the individual R&D effort drops to zero but firms still produce and sell to consumers. As instead to the welfare performance of this industry, one can check thatSW*(τSP(pSP(S¯),N),SP(S¯))is maximised at N ≃ 3522. This result (at least in the numerical example based on the above values) illustrates a situation in which consumer surplus matters more than the environmental externality, so that the industry structure that maximises welfare is a lot more fragmented than that maximising the aggregate volume of green R&D.The inverted-U is relatively stable with respect to the model parameters. However, the level and the position of the curve differs. Table 1summarizes the dependence. The first column includes the effect on the peak, the second column the effect on the level of the curve and the third one links the whole effect to each of the five graphs in Fig. 2, where the qualitative effect on the inverted-U shape is illustrated.
