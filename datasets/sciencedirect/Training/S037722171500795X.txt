Branch-and-price algorithms for the solution of the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time windows

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Our exact methods based on the branch and price principle solve the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time windows.Our contribution emphasises on the pricing algorithms which are based on dynamic programming.We investigate if scheduling of trips is best done within master problem or sub problem.With 25 customer instances derived from Solomon’s, scheduling in master problem allows solving more instances.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We investigate the exact solution of the vehicle routing problem with time windows, where multiple trips are allowed for the vehicles. In contrast to previous works in the literature, we specifically consider the case in which it is mandatory to visit all customers and there is no limitation on duration. We develop two branch-and-price frameworks based on two set covering formulations: a traditional one where columns (variables) represent routes, that is, a sequence of consecutive trips, and a second one in which columns are single trips. One important difficulty related to the latter is the way mutual temporal exclusion of trips can be handled. It raises the issue of time discretization when solving the pricing problem. Our dynamic programming algorithm is based on concept of groups of labels and representative labels. We provide computational results on modified small-sized instances (25 customers) from Solomon’s benchmarks in order to evaluate and compare the two methods. Results show that some difficult instances are out of reach for the first branch-and-price implementation, while they are consistently solved with the second.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The Multi-Trip Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (MTVRPTW) is a variant of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) where multiple trips are allowed for vehicles within the planning time horizon. Multiple trips are beneficial to the carrier by limiting the number of vehicles and drivers necessary to the deliveries, especially in the cases where vehicle capacities, distances or time constraints naturally imply short routes.Formally, the MTVRPTW is defined as follows. Let [0, T] be the planning time horizon. LetG=(V,A)be a directed graph whereV={0,…,n}is the set of vertices and A is the set of arcs. Vertex 0 represents the depot and vertices1,…,nthe customers. A cost cijand a travel time tijare associated with each arc (i, j) ∈ A. Triangle inequality is assumed for times and costs. The fleet comprises U identical vehicles, with load capacity Q. For each customeri∈{1,…,n}are defined a demand di, a time window [ai, bi], a service time stiand a loading time li. Service of customers must start within their time window; however, vehicles may arrive earlier and wait. Service times relate to handling operations at the customers, while loading times concern loading of the vehicles at the depot, before departure.The problem is to find a set of trips of minimal cost, using at most U vehicles, and such that (i) all customers are served, (ii) two trips cannot be assigned to the same vehicle if the schedules of these trips, including loading and return to the depot, overlap, (iii) loads comply with vehicle capacities and (iv) time constraints at customers and the depot are met.In this paper, we propose to address the MTVRPTW with two set covering formulations and branch-and-price solution schemes. As far as we know, these are the first attempts to solve this problem exactly. Branch-and-price is a variant of branch-and-bound where LP-based lower bounds are computed through column generation, because of the huge number of variables. In column generation, two problems, called the restricted master problem and the pricing problem, are solved iteratively until the pricing problem fails to find new potentially improving columns for the restricted master problem. The interested reader is referred to Desrochers, Desrosiers, and Solomon (1992), Barnhart, Johnson, Nemhauser, Savelsbergh, and Vance (1996) or Feillet (2010) for details on column generation and branch-and-price.
