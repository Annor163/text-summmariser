Viewer experience with stereoscopic 3D television in the home

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
120 people reported on TV viewing and other screen use in their home over 8weeks.Viewer reports were compared for conventional 2D and stereoscopic 3D displays.People reported enjoying 3D TV and cinema more than 2D.People reported slightly more adverse effects, e.g. headache, with 3D.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Stereoscopic 3D television (S3D TV) is now available in the home. However, little published information is available on viewer use or experience. In this study, 120 people from 29 households were given a new TV (active or passive stereoscopic 3D, or conventional 2D) and reported on their television viewing and other screen use on a near-daily basis over 8weeks. People reported enjoying S3D TV and cinema more than TV and cinema in general, but enjoying S3D video games less than video games in general. S3D TV and video games were both associated with an increased, though still low (∼10%) level of adverse effects, such as headache and eyestrain. I speculate that this may be because video games present a particularly strong conflict between vergence and accommodative demand.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In recent years, many studies have examined viewers’ experience with stereoscopic 3D (S3D) displays. Most of these have been lab studies [1–6,7]; a few have been observational or survey studies examining reported experience with S3D movies viewed in a cinema [8,9]. To my knowledge, there is so far no published study examining viewer experience in the home. This is a particularly salient omission, given that S3D television in the home is now a reality. Since 2010, several television channels across the world have been broadcasting S3D content.In this study, 30 households were given either an active S3D, a passive S3D or a conventional 2D high-definition television set. They were asked to fill in daily online reports about their screen use. These reports covered not only television, but also computer use, gaming and cinema. They related both to screen use in general, and S3D displays in particular.This paper analyses the data provided by 120 participants over a period of 8weeks each. Its aim is to quantify how ordinary viewers use and experience S3D displays in daily life. This may provide insight into the relatively slow uptake of S3D among the viewing public.
