The extent to which a seat can provide useful attenuation of vehicle vibration depends on three factors: the characteristics of the vehicle motion, the vibration transmissibility of the seat, and the sensitivity of the body to vibration. The ‘seat effective amplitude transmissibility’ (i.e., SEAT value) reflects how these three factors vary with the frequency and the direction of vibration so as to predict the vibration isolation efficiency of a seat. The SEAT value is mostly used to select seat cushions or seat suspensions based on the transmission of vertical vibration to the principal supporting surface of a seat. This study investigated the accuracy of SEAT values in predicting how seats with backrests influence the discomfort caused by multiple-input vibration. Twelve male subjects participated in a four-part experiment to determine equivalent comfort contours, the relative discomfort, the location of discomfort, and seat transmissibility with three foam seats and a rigid reference seat at 14 frequencies of vibration in the range 1–20 Hz at magnitudes of vibration from 0.2 to 1.6 ms−2 r.m.s. The ‘measured seat dynamic discomfort’ (MSDD) was calculated for each foam seat from the ratio of the vibration acceleration required to cause similar discomfort with the foam seat and with the rigid reference seat. Using the frequency weightings in current standards, the SEAT values of each seat were calculated from the ratio of overall ride values with the foam seat to the overall ride values with the rigid reference seat, and compared to the corresponding MSDD at each frequency. The SEAT values provided good predictions of how the foam seats increased vibration discomfort at frequencies around the 4-Hz resonance but reduced vibration discomfort at frequencies greater than about 6.3 Hz, with discrepancies explained by a known limitation of the frequency weightings.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
To reduce the discomfort arising from vibration, vehicle seats can be designed to minimise the transmission of vibration. The optimisation of the vibration transmissibility of a seat requires understanding of how vibration discomfort can be predicted from the vibration experienced at the seat surfaces.The dynamic properties of a seat (e.g., damping and stiffness) are influenced by the physical properties of foam or other material (e.g., density, thickness, firmness) that might be engineered to achieve the desired seating comfort including vibration isolation. The most common method of quantifying the dynamic properties of a seat is the seat transmissibility. This shows how the ratio of vibration measured at the subject–seat interface to the vibration in the same direction on the floor varies according to the frequency of the vibration. The vertical transmissibility from the floor beneath the seat to the surface on the seat squab beneath the ischial tuberosities of a person is most often measured, but non-vertical transmissibility, and the transmissibility to other locations, especially the backrest, are also studied. Unless a seat is entirely rigid, the transmissibility invariably shows that vibration is amplified at some frequencies (i.e., at the resonance frequency) and attenuated at other frequencies. There may be a vertical resonance of a seat squab around 4 Hz (e.g., Corbridge et al., 1989) and fore-and-aft resonance through a seat backrest around 5 Hz (Qiu and Griffin, 2003). However, the transmissibility of a seat is not sufficient to predict vibration discomfort. Discomfort can arise from multiple-input vibration (at a seat squab, at a backrest, and at the feet) and the motion can be complex (e.g., multiple-axis and multiple-frequency or random). The contribution of each input to vibration discomfort must be understood if the transmissibility of a seat is to be optimised (Griffin, 2007).The optimisation of the vibration transmissibility of a seat should not be confined to minimising the amplification that occurs at the resonance frequency. The optimisation must include consideration of all frequencies of vibration that occur on the floor supporting the seat, the extent to which these are transmitted through the seat, and the extent to which they influence comfort, or some other human response (e.g., interference with activities or health). The Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (i.e., SEAT value) was introduced to combine these three functions of frequency in a single value indicating the extent to which a seat improves or degrades vibration discomfort (Griffin, 1978, 1990). The SEAT value may be considered the ratio of the vibration discomfort experienced when sitting on a seat to the vibration discomfort that would be experienced when sitting on a rigid seat (or sitting on the floor). A value greater than 100% (or 1.0) indicates how much the vibration discomfort is increased by the seat. Ideally, seats have SEAT values less than 100%, but this is not always the case. The calculation of a SEAT value requires understanding of how vibration discomfort depends on the frequency of vibration. Originally, this was achieved using the frequency-dependence of the reduced-comfort boundary in the first version of ISO 2631 (1974), but the frequency weightings in later standards are now used (i.e., BS 6841, 1987, ISO 2631-1, 1997). The SEAT concept has been adopted in various standards for quantifying the efficiency of seats in isolating vertical vibration (e.g., ISO 10326-1, 1992, ISO 7096, 2000).Although the SEAT value is most usually applied to quantify the vertical isolation efficiency of the seat squab (or seat suspension), it can be used for other directions of vibration. For example, it can be used to quantify the efficiency of a seat in isolating the transmission of fore-and-aft vibration to the backrest (Griffin, 1990). More generally, a SEAT value can be used to quantify the overall isolation efficiency of seat by a single value, taking into account multi-axis vibration transmitted to both the seat squab and the backrest.The concept behind the SEAT value is intuitively obvious: it uses a method of predicting vibration discomfort to compare the vibration discomfort when sitting in a seat to the vibration discomfort that will be experienced when sitting in a reference seat (i.e., a rigid seat). Nevertheless, there are assumptions that are not entirely obvious. For example, the method will not provide a good estimate of the isolation efficiency of a seat if the weightings for the frequency of vibration or the direction of vibration do not accurately reflect how vibration discomfort varies with the frequency or direction of vibration. There will also be errors if the method of combining the vibration experienced in different directions, or at different locations, or in different postures (e.g., due to inclined backrests) is not appropriate. Although the SEAT value is widely used, there has been little investigation of how well it predicts the influence of realistic seats on vibration discomfort.With solely vertical vibration (often the dominant direction in transport), the vibration isolation efficiency of a seat can be predicted from a SEAT value calculated from vertical vibration at the seat pan (using frequency weighting Wb from BS 6841:1987 or frequency weighting Wk from ISO 2631-1 (1997)) and vibration at the backrest (using frequency weightings Wc and Wd) (Griffin, 2007). However, seats usually have inclined backrests and it has been reported that the Wc weighting overestimates the discomfort caused by x-axis vibration of inclined backrests at low frequencies and underestimates at frequencies greater than 8 Hz (Kato and Hanai, 1998; Basri and Griffin, 2011). Furthermore, with increasing inclination of a backrest there is greater support for the upper-body and the relative importance of vertical seat pan vibration is reduced (Basri and Griffin, 2012, 2013). It is not known how well a SEAT value based on currently standardised weightings will predict the overall vibration discomfort when sitting in a compliant seat with an inclined backrest.The experiment reported here was designed to investigate how the compliance of seats with inclined backrests influence vibration discomfort. The effect of seat compliance on SEAT values (calculated from evaluations of vibration at the seat, the back, and the feet) was compared with the effect of seat compliance on judgements of vibration discomfort.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Useful predictions of how the compliance of seats with backrests influence the discomfort caused by vertical vibration are provided by SEAT values determined from overall ride values that take into account the discomfort caused by vibration at the seat, the back, the feet, and any other source.Differences in the present study between SEAT values and subjective judgements of discomfort over the range 1.0–20 Hz can be explained by known assumptions and simplifications in currently standardised methods of predicting vibration discomfort. The discrepancies are likely to be partially due to the use of frequency weightings for vertical (i.e., z-axis) seat vibration and fore-and-aft (i.e., x-axis) back vibration that do not take into account the influence of the inclination of the backrest on the frequency-dependence of vibration discomfort at the seat and the backrest.
