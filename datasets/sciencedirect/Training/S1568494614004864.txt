@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In designing a supply chain (SC) system, the problem arises when a company has unsatisfactory inventory control policy and material routing between supplierâ€“producer and distributor in SC considering specified cost and demand. The integration of decisions of different functions into a single optimization model is the base of this research. The aim of this paper is to study and compare the existing models of supply, production and distribution in SC and propose a model which integrates mentioned criteria in supply chain management (SCM). Furthermore, it proposes a new method for calculation of fitness function in genetic algorithm (GA) process. The successful designing of this model has led us to explore the use of heuristic methods such as GA to quantify the flow of SC, information and material flow. At first, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is adapted to evaluate objective function weights in SC. Then final weights of objective function are determined by the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). This research also simulated the real company SC operations, and determines the most effective strategic and operational policies for an effective SC system. The result obtained from the model shows that it is robust. This model can also be applied to other industrial environments with slight modifications.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The increasingly tough competition in current international marketplaces, results in companies' endeavor to find effective strategies that benefit them more than their rivals. [1]. In fact, competition is among the supply chains and not the companies [2]. Thus, in recent years, the importance of supply chain management (SCM) as an area for research has been acknowledged. This can be observed from academic publications, conferences and seminars, market demands and practitioners, qualified development programs, and university and academic courses [3]. The term SCM, initially emerged as an idea, a theory, and a management process in the 1980s [4]; since then, the academic focus and regular practice of techniques has grown multifold [5]. Today, because of the popularity of the filed, researchers in many diverse academic areas are carrying out their studies in SCM [6].Chan and Chung [7] extended multi-criteria genetic optimization for distribution network problems in SCM. A distribution problem is assignment of a number of sources to a number of destinations under different decision factors and circumstances which are interrelated and influenceed by each other. To obtain the optimum solution, genetic algorithm (GA) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique provide a greater control over the situation for decision makers. More information can be obtained for a better understanding of distribution networks; however, this research has focused on network designing and only the distribution problems have been studied by the authors. Chan et al. [8] proposed a hybrid GA for production and distribution problems in multi-factory supply chain (SC) models. In their work, a single product type in multi-factory SC was studied. Meanwhile, in real world, this philosophy is not applicable; and besides, the production processes in company have been simplified also the production scheduling problem has not been reflected as well. Guan et al. [9] proposed digital manufacturing machining system selection based on GA and AHP. The study proposed a GA to achieve the overall objective for the formulation of Pareto-optimal selection of digital manufacturing system, and then used it in fixed manufacturing operating plan conditions for machine selection. The evaluation of the criteria in their study is not exhaustive and the arithmetic average of the criteria in the case they studied is the value of experience. The decision maker can make the choice of the machining system according to the different requirements. In addition, Kubat and Yuce [10] suggested, supplier selection with GA and fuzzy AHP (FAHP). They used FAHP to determine uncertain weights which are linguistic expressions; then, determined each supplier's weight using identified factors. Finally, they determined the best supplier by the use of GA for each of the part ordered.The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review on SC modeling. The problem statement is discussed in Section 3. Proposed algorithm using hybrid GA is presented in Section 4. Section 5 describes the heuristic application of FAHP and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) with numerical example. The simulation results are presented in Section 6 and finally, conclusions and further researches are clarified in Section 7.
