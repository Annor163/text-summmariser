The aim of our research was to find out if the time irreversibility as a sign of specific class of nonlinear dynamics is present even in the newborn's heart rate oscillations. Multiscale irreversibility indices (Porta's index P%, Guzik index G% and Ehlers index E) of the heart rate signals were computed in 20 healthy neonates. The presence of system nonlinearity was assessed by surrogate data analysis. The results of our analysis revealed asymmetrical nature of heart rate oscillations present in the majority of neonatal heart rate recordings. Moreover, time irreversibility index P% was able to detect shift of sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic dominance in newborns. Our findings support the concept of nonlinearity as a universal feature of the biological control system even in the early stage of the system maturation. This finding supports the application of nonlinear methods to heart rate variability analysis.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cardiovascular system represents a very precisely and promptly controlled physiological system of the human body. Regulatory mechanisms maintaining the optimal cardiovascular system function are very complex and aimed to adequately react to quickly changing needs of the organism. The instantaneous “beat-to-beat” modulation of cardiovascular parameters is provided mainly by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Autonomic cardiovascular control is then reflected in the spontaneous fluctuations of the cardiac cycle duration – heart rate variability (HRV) – and its analysis can provide useful information about cardiovascular system autonomic regulation [1–6].The cardiovascular control of the newborns has its specific features and limits, as the feedback and feedforward mechanisms enabling optimal control of the heart are yet not fully developed. Therefore, HRV analysis can represent a useful tool for the evaluation of the degree of autonomic nervous system maturation in the infants [7–11].Heart rate variability has been conventionally analyzed by linear methods in time and frequency domains [12]. However, cardiac rhythm originates from sinoatrial node controlled by numerous nonlinear mechanisms operating on the basis of feedback loops with different time delays. The nonlinear nature of these interacting physiological systems, influencing each other, calls for the nonlinear analysis which can be more suitable, precise and potentially more sensitive than linear analysis as it covers complex dynamics of the heart rate regulation more appropriately [13–17].Time irreversibility or time asymmetry is a recently described phenomenon in adult HRV characterized by faster increase and slower decrease in heart rate signal and it was found to be sensitive to sympathovagal balance changes [2,18]. A signal is said to be time irreversible if its statistical properties change after its time reversal. Time irreversibility is specific for nonequilibrium systems [19] and its extensive presence in cardiovascular signals in adults results from the complexity of the highly adaptable cardiovascular control system. It is not well known whether this phenomenon is present already in young children and even in newborns. The aim of this study was to analyze heart rate time irreversibility in a group of healthy full-term newborns. In addition, we used irreversibility analysis together with surrogate data approach to detect the presence of cardiac rhythm control system nonlinearity in newborns.
