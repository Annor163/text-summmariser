@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this study, we propose a set of new algorithms to enhance the effectiveness of classification for 5-year survivability of breast cancer patients from a massive data set with imbalanced property. The proposed classifier algorithms are a combination of synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), while integrating some well known classifiers, such as logistic regression, C5 decision tree (C5) model, and 1-nearest neighbor search. To justify the effectiveness for this new set of classifiers, the g-mean and accuracy indices are used as performance indexes; moreover, the proposed classifiers are compared with previous literatures. Experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm of SMOTE+PSO+C5 is the best one for 5-year survivability of breast cancer patient classification among all algorithm combinations. We conclude that, implementing SMOTE in appropriate searching algorithms such as PSO and classifiers such as C5 can significantly improve the effectiveness of classification for massive imbalanced data sets.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Data mining is a process in the “knowledge discovery” to discover useful information through a large amount of data. This process is widely applied in medical, social science, management, engineering, and many other fields. In recent years, data mining is used for health care management to classify/justify disease prevalence and medical diagnosis. However, data mining problems are challenging in health care due to large, complex, heterogeneous, hierarchical time series data [1,2].Cancer is a serious problem in health care since it is a major cause of death. Thus its treatment outcome needs to be monitored carefully. The annual number of deaths caused by cancers is around 7.4 million (13% of all deaths) worldwide and breast cancer is one of the five most life-threatening types of cancer [3]. For instance, DeSantis et al. [4] reported that around 230,480 of US women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 39,520 of breast cancer patients died in 2011. Due to such serious impact by this disease, not only the patients but their families also suffer. Thus, it is essential to know the survivability of the patients and to ease the decision making process regarding medical treatment and financial preparation. Meanwhile, false classification will cause wasted money and/or inappropriate treatments to cure the breast cancer.The imbalanced data set is defined as two-class data set in which one class (called majority) has overwhelming number of instances than the other class (called minority). The classification problem for imbalanced data is interesting and challenging to researchers because most standard data mining methods claim their assumption for balanced data but are not applicable for imbalanced one [5,6]. When these standard methods are applied to imbalanced data sets, they are overwhelmed by the instances in majority class, ignoring the instances in minority class; thus this phenomenon results in high accuracy for the majority class but poor accuracy for the minority one [7]. It is worthy to note that, presently, the advance of cancer diagnosis and treatments have been able to reduce the mortality and increase the survival time for patients, thus the number of survival patients obviously outnumbers the number of non-survival patients.Researchers have addressed two kinds of solutions for data classification dealing with imbalanced problems: solving in data level by re-sampling, and solving in algorithm level by using design sophisticated classification approaches, where the prior one is preferred due to ease of use [7,8]. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) proposed by Chawla et al. [9] is a well-known re-sampling method which was employed in several data preprocessing studies; such as, Zhao et al. [10], Pelayo and Dick [11], Kamei et al. [12], and Gu et al. [5]. By using SMOTE, one can increase the number of instances in minority class by creating new synthetic instances rather than replication (as a result the decision region of the minority class become more general); thus, the over-fitting problem in learning algorithm can be avoided [5,9,13].Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a meta heuristic algorithm, is proved to be superior to other soft-computing algorithms in certain characteristics. Elbeltagi et al. [14] compared five algorithms (i.e., genetic algorithms (GAs), mimetic algorithms, particle swarm, ant-colony systems, and shuffled frog leaping). They concluded that PSO algorithm outperformed the other algorithms in terms of success rate and solution quality. PSO using less parameters than GA and evolutionary algorithm (EA) [15] and it converges faster than GA [16–18]. Note that despite using less parameter, PSO has the same performance or even better than GA [19,20]. Moreover, PSO retained the knowledge of good solutions of all particles while GA lacks for this memory [21]. Because of its advantages, recently PSO has been widely applied to medical problems [1,2,15,22,23].Moreover, PSO has been used to remedy imbalanced problems in different functions. For instance, Yang et al. [24] applied PSO in data pre-processing to re-size the training set. In addition, PSO is able to find the best values of parameters; Lee et al. [25] employed PSO to find the best values of minimum cases and the pruning confidence factor of a decision tree for imbalanced data set classification. In their study, the original data set is balanced by using over-sampling method, although it consumes certain computational time. It is worthwhile to note that Gao et al. [8] recently proposed the combination of SMOTE and PSO-based radial basis function (RBF) algorithm to classify two-class imbalanced problems and achieved some promising result; herein the parameters of RBF kernels are determined using a PSO algorithm.Conventional BPNNs, SVM suffer from time consuming problem [26–30]. An emerging trend arises by integration of PSO and standard classifiers. Chen et al. [31] proposed the combination of PSO and 1-nn for feature selection to enhance the effectiveness of classification for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis. They compared their proposed algorithm with black propagation neural networks (BPNNs), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision tree (C4.5), and GA+1-nn and concluded that the PSO+1-nn algorithm is the best. However, the issue of dealing with imbalanced data sets is still unsolved.As per previous survey, this study aims at answering the following research questions.(i)A new set of algorithms which apply SMOTE and PSO with classic classifiers, such as 1-nn, LR, and C5, is promising to deal with massive and imbalanced medical data sets. Can such combinations improve the performance of 5-year breast cancer survivability patient classification?How much improvement for imbalanced data can be achieved by empowering SMOTE to the PSO implementation with classic classifiers proposed by Chen et al. [31]?The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces SMOTE, PSO methods, classifiers and evaluation of algorithm. Section 3 gives the experiment and results. Section 4 presents a discussion and Section 5 gives conclusions.
