@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Automatically detecting events in crowded scenes is a challenging task in Computer Vision. A number of offline approaches have been proposed for solving the problem of crowd behavior detection, however the offline assumption limits their application in real-world video surveillance systems. In this paper, we propose an online and real-time method for detecting events in crowded video sequences. The proposed approach is based on the combination of visual feature extraction and image segmentation and it works without the need of a training phase. A quantitative experimental evaluation has been carried out on multiple publicly available video sequences, containing data from various crowd scenarios and different types of events, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Event detection in the field of automatic video surveillance has gained a growing interest [1]. The huge amount of data generated by existing surveillance systems in public areas requires the development of intelligent solutions that can avoid information overload for the users [2]. In particular, in the context of a crowd image analysis problem, it is desirable to develop online algorithms that reliably detect abnormal events in real-time. As an example, the automatic detection of anomalies in crowded scenes can be used to avoid crowd related disasters and ensure public safety [3].An anomaly can be defined as “something that deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected”11Definition from the Oxford Dictionary.. This means that abnormal events can be identified as irregular situations with respect to usual normal ones. Thus, the abnormal detection becomes the identification of abnormal events given some sample normal events. Zhan et al. [4] point out that conventional Computer Vision can be ineffective when dealing with the analysis of very crowded video sequences. Indeed, in a high-density situation the presence of severe occlusions consistently limits the performance of traditional methods for visual tracking [3]. Additional factors that can limit the effectiveness of existing approaches aiming at detecting abnormal events are: (1) Offline computation and (2) Need of a training phase. The offline assumption can limit the application of anomaly detection methods in practice [5]. For instance, it is desirable to detect panic situations as soon as possible in order to avoid damage to people. The methods that rely on the training of a classifier are limited by the possible lack of well-suited training data. Indeed, since it is not easy to find data about real emergency situations in crowded scenes, the resulting classifier could be suitable only for dealing with particular video sequences.In this paper, we propose an online and real-time method for automatic anomaly detection in crowded scenes, which does not need any training stage. The method is inspired by the concept of Shannon entropy [6]. Entropy characterizes the uncertainty about the source of information and it increases for more sources of greater randomness. The idea is that the less likely an event is, the more information it provides when it occurs. Fig. 1shows an example where the Shannon entropy value increases in the case of an abnormal event.The two main contributions of the proposed approach are:1.The use of two different metrics, namely instant entropy and temporal occupancy variation, to detect online abnormal situations in crowded scenes;An unsupervised segmentation algorithm for images containing crowds.Furthermore, we provide:•A novel video sequence annotated with ground truth data, containing images of hundreds of runners at the start of a marathon, as an example of crowd video with locally steady optical flow.Ground truth annotations for two well-known video sequences containing abnormal events in crowded scenes, namely PETS 2009 [7] and AGORASET [8].The C++ source code and all the data used for the experimental evaluation, thus allowing for reproducing the results described in this paper and to compare other similar approaches.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Related work is analyzed in the next Section 2, while our method is presented in Section 3. Section 4 describes the qualitative and quantitative experimental results, providing also a comparison with other online approaches in the literature. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, a real-time and online crowd behavior detection algorithm for video sequences is described. The algorithm, called FSCB, is based on a pipeline made of the following stages: (1) stable features are tracked between frames of the sequence; (2) a temporal mask is extracted; (3) moving blobs are found using segmentation; (4) anomalous events are detected using two measures, i.e., instant entropy and temporal occupancy variation.Quantitative experiments have been conducted on different publicly available data sets: UMN [26], PETS 2009 [7], AGORASET [8]. For PETS 2009 and AGORASET, ground truth data have been produced and made available at the FSCB website. Furthermore, a novel annotated data set, Rome Marathon [27], containing crowded scenes from the start of a marathon, has been created.FSCB has been quantitatively compared with other state-of-the-art methods for online crowd event detection. The results of the comparison demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, that works without the need of a training stage and obtain real-time performance on 320 × 240 images.
