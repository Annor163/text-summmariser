@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Physicists research the symmetry of particle space through the contrast of motion law in the real space and inversion space which is created by space inversion techniques. Inspired by this theory, we propose the idea of using local space transformation and dynamic relative position to detect the clustering boundary in high dimensional space. Due to the curse of dimensionality, global space transformation approaches are not only time-consuming, but also fail to keep the original distribution characteristics. So, we inverse the space positions of the k nearest neighbors and project them on the high dimensional space coordinate system. To address the lack of statistics that can describe the uniformity of high dimensional space, we propose the Symmetry Statistics based on the Hopkins Statistics. It is employed to judge the uniformity of k nearest neighbor space of coordinate origin. Moreover, we introduce a filter function to remove some special noises and isolated points. Finally, we use boundary and filter ratios to detect the clustering boundary and propose the corresponding detection algorithm, called Spinver. Experimental results from synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Extracting the valuable patterns [1–3] in complex information space is the key problem of data mining. The patterns will help people to understand data space, and get more valuable information. So, there is no doubt that the extraction process can be described as segmenting the information space, and different segmentation methods will lead to different pattern results. The clustering techniques [4–8], which use none experience way [9], classify the unlabeled data objects by grouping objects that are similar to each other. By analyzing the similarities and differences between different classes, it can get the stable structure of data space, i.e. clusters. In addition to this familiar pattern, we find a more interesting pattern-clustering boundary.Clustering boundary [10], which is located at the edge of a cluster is a special pattern. Data objects within the cluster have the same class label, but there exists some differences between the interior objects and the boundary objects. Boundary objects, in many applications, may indicate special targets that need to pay close attention on, for example, people who have infected with some virus but not be attacked, side face images in the front face images, irregular handwriting signatures, the gene mutation individuals in the gene expression datasets, and etc. When scholars are delighted to find such interesting researches, they also find the traditional data mining technology cannot extract the clustering boundary. In recent years, some clustering boundary detection techniques have been proposed, such as BORDER [11,12], BRIM [13], BAND [14], BRINK [15], and etc. However, the research on clustering boundary is not so extensive as that clustering technology, especially for the high dimensional data space [16–18]. So, this study will be aimed at the clustering boundary pattern discovery in high dimensional space.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work. Section 3 reports the clustering boundary model. Section 4 presents experiments and performance results on a number of synthetic and real data sets. Section 5 provides an intuitive discussion on parameters analysis and scalability. Our conclusion is given in Section 6.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We propose a high dimensional clustering boundary detection algorithm. Inspired by the space inversion of particle physics, we propose the idea of local space transformation and dynamic relative position, and construct a clustering boundary detection algorithm for the challenging problem of high dimensional space. Experiments show that Spinver algorithm provides meaningful results and significantly improves the detection quality no matter the data space has a low or high dimension. Moreover, we provide a Filter function to help the algorithm to handle the outliers. The performance of our algorithm on real data sets verifies the application value in the medicine field. Experiments on image data sets extend our research range.
