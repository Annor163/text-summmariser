@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As the minimum lithographic feature size in integrated circuit (IC) patterning continues to shrink, the development of both lithography tools and resist materials for the next generation of devices has become increasingly important [1,2]. With extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) – considered the most promising solution for next generation lithography – delayed due to a number of technical issues as well as infrastructural immaturity [3,4], development in electron beam lithography (EBL) as an alternative for volume production has received ncreasing focus.A number of projection electron beam and multi-beam technologies have been developed to improve throughput whilst maintaining the high-resolution capability of traditional single beam direct write systems [5,6]. Among these novel EBL technologies, several different beam energies are utilized for various application purposes. MAPPER (MAPPER Lithography) and other earlier microcolumn tools utilize low acceleration voltages of 5kV or below [5,7]; A proof-of-concept multibeam mask writer from IMS Nanofabrication uses 50kV electron beams [6,8]; whilst the reflective electron beam lithography (REBL) tool under development by KLA-Tencor uses acceleration voltages up to 100kV [9].With the increased demands of high volume manufacturing, high-performance electron beam resists are also required. Conventional electron beam resists generally have high resolution but poor sensitivity. Typical examples are poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) [10,11]. Recently, a number of advanced resist systems (mainly developed for EUVL) with good combination of sensitivity and resolution have been developed. Among them there are several high performance chemically amplified resists (CARs) such as an epoxy based negative tone molecular resist [12] and a polymer based positive tone resist [13]. Some novel non-chemically amplified resists have also been developed showing excellent resolution with reasonable sensitivity, including an organic polymer resist [14], inorganic metal-oxide nanoparticles [15] and organometallic clusters [16]. Among them the fastest electron beam resist showed a sensitivity of 2.06μC/cm2 (20kV). However, its resolution was limited at 20nm 1:2 line/space features [14]. On the other hand, the resist having the highest resolution (12nm half pitch) requires a dose above 900μC/cm2 at 30kV [15]. Although recently, particularly in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) resists, there is a trend towards non-chemically amplified resists to achieve better line edge roughness (LER) control [17], for EBL, even with multibeam technology, throughput and thus resist sensitivity is still the major limitation for application in volume production.It is known that lithographic performance varies with different beam energies for a certain resist due to differences in energy distribution and deposition [18]. Therefore, evaluations of resist performance at various beam energies is of particular interest for newly designed resists as potential candidates for the emerging electron beam technologies.In previous work we have developed a family of chemically amplified phenolic fullerene resists with good overall lithographic performance [19]. During the optimization and further analysis of the fullerene system, a new high performance negative tone molecular resist, xMT, has been designed [20]. The structure of the xMT molecule is shown in Fig. 1. As xMT does not contain fullerene, the cost of the material synthesis can be greatly reduced. A three-compound CAR is formulated by mixing xMT with an oligomeric epoxy crosslinker and a photo-acid generator (PAG) (Fig. 1). The reaction scheme in this resist has yet to be definitively elucidated but we propose that the xMT molecule undergoes acid catalyzed removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (tBOC) group, whilst the epoxy undergoes cationic ring opening. It is likely that multiple reaction pathways involving both cationic epoxy chain growth and epoxy-phenol condensation occur as shown in Fig. 2. In this study the lithographic performance of xMT resist is evaluated using EBL tools with various acceleration voltages. The durability of this resist under plasma etch is also investigated.The xMT molecule was synthesized at Nano-C (USA) by reacting 1,8-Diazabiccycloundecene-7-ene with tert-butoxycarbonyl (tBOC) protected phenol on a malonate chain. The crosslinker CL12-01, poly[(phenyl glycidyl ether)-co-formaldehyde] (Mn=1270), was purchased from Huntsman Advanced Materials (USA). The crosslinker CL08–01 (Mn=870), which has the same structure as CL12-01 but with a smaller molecular weight, was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (UK). The PAG used in this study, triphenylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate, was purchased from Midori Kagaku Co. (Japan). The nucleophilic additive, triphenylsulfonium nonaflate, was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (UK).Resist films were spun on 18×18mm silicon chips either with or without underlayer. Prior to coating of the resist or underlayer, the silicon substrates went through a simple acetone/isopropanol (IPA) clean, in which the silicon chips were ultra-sonicated for 10min in acetone followed by another 10min in IPA.Resist compounds were all dissolved in ethyl lactate with a concentration of 20g/L and blended to give a weight ratio of 0.2:2:1 for xMT, crosslinker and PAG. A nucleophilic additive is added at 5wt% in certain cases. Spin speed is adjusted to give a resist film thickness of 30–40nm for the sensitivity test, and 20–25nm for high-resolution patterning. A 5-minute post-application bake (PAB) at 70°C was applied after spin coating. After exposure, samples received a post-exposure bake (PEB) for 1min. Samples were subsequently developed in cyclohexanone for 30s or in n-butyl acetate for 1min.EBL tools with various acceleration voltages were used to expose the resists. For the 20kV and 30kV exposures, a FEI XL 30 SFEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) with ELPHY Plus pattern generator (RAITH GmbH) at the University of Birmingham (UK) was used. For the 50kV exposures, a CABL 9510C EBL system at Fundacio Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques (ICFO, Spain) was used. For the 100kV exposures, a JBX 6300FS EBL system at the University of Leeds (UK) was used. Where possible the SEM images of resist patterns were analyzed with the software package SUMMIT to extract the LER values.Silicon etching was performed with an Oxford Instruments PlasmaPro NGP80 tool using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) technology. The gas mixture used was either SF6/CHF3 or SF6/C4F8. For the SF6/CHF3 etch, the process conditions were 15sccm SF6, 50sccm CHF3, 20W RF power and 200W ICP power at 15mT chamber pressure at 5°C. For the SF6/C4F8 etch, the conditions were 25sccm SF6, 30sccm C4F8, 20W RF power and 220W ICP power. The resist thickness was measured with a surface profiler prior to etching and re-measured after silicon etching. Afterwards the residual resist was stripped with oxygen plasma and the height of the silicon features measured again. The etch rate of the resist material was then calculated from these measurements.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A novel molecular resist material, xMT, is presented in this work. By blending this material with an oligomer epoxy crosslinker and a photo-acid generator to form a negative tone chemically amplified resist, a combination of high sensitivity and high resolution was achieved. Plasma etching evaluation shows that this resist has a comparable etch resistance to the high-durability commercial electron beam resist SAL601. The lithographic performance of this resist can be further tailored by selecting the molecular size of the epoxy crosslinker. A resolution capability study of this resist at various beam acceleration voltages shows a resolution improvement with increasing beam energy, which indicates that the ultimate resolution of this resist system might still be limited by the exposure tool. In summary, this new molecular resist system has shown promising performance at various beam energies, which enables its potential applications in advanced electron beam lithography.
