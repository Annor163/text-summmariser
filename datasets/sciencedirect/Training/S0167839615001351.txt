@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
μ-bases for rational curves are important since we can use μ-bases to implicitize rational planar curves (Chen and Wang, 2003). Moreover, μ-bases for rational curves in arbitrary dimensions can be applied to locate and analyze their singularities (Song et al., 2007; Jia and Goldman, 2009, 2012; Shi and Chen, 2010). There are fast algorithms to compute μ-bases for rational curves based mainly on Gaussian Elimination (Chen and Wang, 2003; Song and Goldman, 2009). However, we do not know what the μ-bases look like before we run the algorithm; this drawback prevents us from finding closed formulas for the singularities or the implicit equation for rational curves based on the method of μ-bases.Here we give explicit formulas for the μ-bases of conic sections and planar rational cubic curves. As fundamental objects in Computer Aided Geometric Design and Computer Graphics, conic sections and planar rational cubic curves have a wide range of applications, for example, in animation control and font design. Implicit equations for planar rational cubic curves will also help us when we deal with intersection algorithms (Sederberg and Parry, 1986; Thomassen, 2005).Special attention has been devoted to computing implicit equations for planar rational cubic curves. Sederberg et al. (1985) treat planar rational cubic curves as monoids, that is, degree n curves with a singular point of ordern−1. This approach simplifies the derivation of the implicit equation. Floater (1995) proves that the implicit equation of every planar rational cubic curve can be represented by linear combinations of six basis functions. Using the results of Busé and Jouanolou (2003), one can also derive a closed formula for the implicit equation of a rational cubic curveP(t)=(x(t),y(t),w(t))as the determinant of3×3matrix by inspecting the Bezoutian matrix:M=x⋅Bez(y(t),w(t))+y⋅Bez(w(t),x(t))+w⋅Bez(x(t),y(t))(see Section 4 for further details). In contrast, using our explicit formulas for μ-bases of planar rational cubic curves, we derive two closed formulas – one as the determinant of a sparse3×3Sylvester matrix and one as the determinant of a2×2Bezoutian matrix – for the implicit equations of planar rational cubic curves. Moreover, we also provide closed formulas for the double point of planar rational cubic curves. Explicit formulas for implicit equations of planar rational cubic Bézier curves are also presented recently in Barrowclough (2014). But our explicit formulas for these implicit equations based on μ-bases are more compact. Moreover, using μ-bases for planar rational cubic curves, we get explicit formulas for their double points in a simpler, more straightforward way.This paper is structured in the following fashion. In Section 2 we review the notion of μ-bases for planar rational curves. We give the explicit formulas for the μ-bases and closed form expressions for the implicit equations of conic sections and planar rational cubic curves in Section 3 and Section 4. We also provide explicit formulas for the double point of planar rational cubic curves in Section 4. Section 5 extends the explicit formula for the μ-bases of conic sections to μ-bases for rational curves of degree n in n-dimensions. We close in Section 6 with some observations about our methods.In this section we briefly review the concept of μ-bases for planar rational curves. We begin with the notion of syzygies.Consider a real planar rational curveP(t)=(x(t),y(t),w(t))in homogeneous form, wheregcd⁡(x(t),y(t),w(t))=1. A syzygy ofP(t)is a vector of polynomialsL(t)=(l0(t),l1(t),l2(t))such thatL(t)⋅P(t)≡0. The set of all syzygies ofP(t)is a free module with two generators over the ringR[t]of polynomials in t with real coefficients (Chen and Wang, 2003). A μ-basis for the planar rational curveP(t)is a special basis for this free module.Definition 1Two syzygiesu0(t),u1(t)are a μ-basis for a rational curveP(t)if1)deg⁡(u0(t))+deg⁡(u1(t))=deg⁡(P(t)),u0(t)×u1(t)=λP(t)for some nonzero constant λ.There are also several other equivalent definitions of a μ-basis for the curveP(t)(see Chen and Wang, 2003 for more details). For example, 2) in Definition 1 can be replaced by2′)u0(t)andu1(t)areR[t]-linearly independent.Every planar rational curve has a μ-basis. Moreover, there is an algorithm for computing μ-bases based on Gaussian elimination (Chen and Wang, 2003). In contrast, we shall find closed formulas for a μ-basis of conic sections and planar rational cubic curves.One important property of μ-bases is that the implicit equation of the planar rational curveP(t)can be calculated as(1)f(x,y,w)σ=Rest(u0(t)⋅(x,y,w),u1(t)⋅(x,y,w))=0,where σ is the degree of the parametrization P. Thus both the parametric and implicit equations of the curveP(t)can be retrieved from its μ-basisu0(t),u1(t). Moreover, we can also compute the singular points of a planar rational curveP(t)from its μ-basis (Chen et al., 2008; Jia and Goldman, 2009).From the viewpoint of geometry, ifl(t)=(l0(t),l1(t),l2(t))is a syzygy ofP(t), we call(2)l(t)⋅(x,y,w)=l0(t)x+l1(t)y+l2(t)w=0a moving line that follows the curveP(t)because the pointP(t)=(x(t),y(t),w(t))lies on the linel(t)⋅(x,y,w)=0. The line (2) changes as the parameter t varies, thus (2) represents a family of lines. If all the lines in the family pass through a common point, the common point is called an axis and the moving line is called an axial moving line.Whendeg⁡(l(t))=1, the moving line (2) is a linear moving line. One simple case of an axial moving line is a linear moving line. Since a linear moving linel(t)⋅(x,y,w)=0can be rewritten as(l0+l1t)⋅(x,y,w)=0, it is easy to check thatl0×l1is the axis of this moving line. Thus every linear moving line is an axial moving line.Letl(t)⋅(x,y,w)=0be an axial moving line forP(t)with an axisA=(x0,y0,w0). Then since for all t the axis A lies on the linel(t)⋅(x,y,w)=0,l(t)⋅A=l(t)⋅(x0,y0,w0)≡0.On the other hand,l(t)⋅P(t)≡0. So the axis A is also a point on the curveP(t). Moreover, singular points of a planar rational curve are also related to its axial moving lines.Theorem 2(SeeSong et al., 2007.) A is a singular point of orderk≥2of a planar rational curveP(t)of degree n if and only if there is a moving line of degreen−kwith axis A that follows the curveP(t).In this paper, our investigations of planar rational curves focus only on conic sections and planar rational cubic curves. Moreover, all the rational curves studied in this paper are assumed to be non-degenerate. It is well known that there are no singular points on non-degenerate conic sections and there is always exactly one double point (i.e., a singular point of order 2) on every non-degenerate planar rational cubic curve. So by Theorem 2, for every non-degenerate planar rational cubic curve there is a linear moving line that follows the curve, and the axis of this linear moving line is the unique double point of the cubic curve.In this section we shall find explicit formulas for a μ-basis of an arbitrary conic section. We shall then use this μ-basis to derive a closed formula for the implicit equation of a conic section from its rational quadratic parametrization.Consider a non-degenerate conic in homogeneous form(3)P(t)=p0+p1t+p2t2,wherepi∈R3. The three coefficient vectorsp0,p1,p2must be linearly independent, that is,(p0×p2)⋅p1≠0. Otherwise there is a constant vectorΓ≠0such thatΓ⊥pi,i=0,1,2.SoΓ⋅P(t)≡0. Hence the conicP(t)degenerates into the lineΓ⋅(x,y,w)=0.Letu0(t),u1(t)be a μ-basis for the conicP(t). From the definition of a μ-basis,deg⁡(u0(t))=deg⁡(u1(t))=1.Next we shall show how to find explicit formulas for two degree one syzygies of the conic (3).Computing the outer product ofp2andP(t), we getp2×P(t)=(p2×p0)+(p2×p1)t.Moreoverp2×P(t)followsP(t)since(p2×P(t))⊥P(t). Thus we have found an explicit formula for one degree one syzygy of the conicP(t). To get a second degree one syzygy forP(t), we compute the outer product ofp0andP(t). It is easy to see thatp0×P(t)t=(p0×p1)+(p0×p2)t.Moreoverp0×P(t)talso followsP(t)sincep0×P(t)t⊥P(t). Thus,p0×P(t)tis also a degree one syzygy forP(t).Next we shall showp0×P(t)tandp2×P(t)are a μ-basis for the conicP(t).Computing the outer product ofp0×P(t)tandp2×P(t)yields(4)(p0×P(t)t)×(p2×P(t))=((p0×p1)+(p0×p2)t)×((p2×p0)+(p2×p1)t)=((p0×p2)⋅p1)P(t).Let|abc|denote the scalar triple product(a×b)⋅c. It is well known that|abc|=det⁡(abc),wheredet⁡(abc)is the determinant of the3×3matrix whose columns are the three vectorsa,b,c∈R3. Then (4) can be rewritten as(p0×P(t)t)×(p2×P(t))=|p0p2p1|⋅P(t).Sincep0,p1,p2are linearly independent,|p0p2p1|≠0. Therefore it follows from the definition of a μ-basis that(5)p0×P(t)t=(p0×p1)+(p0×p2)tp2×P(t)=(p2×p0)+(p2×p1)tare a μ-basis for the conicP(t). Moreover by Equation (1), a closed form expression for the implicit equation of the conic curveP(t)isF(x,y,w)≡det⁡((p0×p1)⋅X(p0×p2)⋅X(p2×p0)⋅X(p2×p1)⋅X)=0,whereX=(x,y,w). Notice that this determinant is exactly the Bézout resultant of the rational parametrization in Equation (3).Remark 1By inspecting the matrix(6)M=x⋅Bez(y(t),w(t))+y⋅Bez(w(t),x(t))+w⋅Bez(x(t),y(t)),whereBez(f(t),g(t))represents the Bezoutian matrix associated with the two polynomialsf(t),g(t), one can find a different way to get the implicitization matrix (Busé and Jouanolou, 2003):(7)((p0×p1)⋅X(p0×p2)⋅X(p2×p0)⋅X(p2×p1)⋅X).However, it is not so obvious that one can rewrite the matrix M in the form (7) if there is no advance notice. On the other hand, the matrix (7) follows directly after we get the closed formula of the μ-basis in Equation (5).Example 1Consider a conicP(t)=p0+p1t+p2t2, wherep0=(3,2,−2),p1=(0,2,1),p2=(−3,4,1).Then(p0×p1)+(p0×p2)t=(6,−3,6)+(10,3,18)t,(p2×p0)+(p2×p1)t=(−10,−3,−18)+(2,3,−6)tare a μ-basis forP(t). Indeed((p0×p1)+(p0×p2)t)×((p2×p0)+(p2×p1)t)=|p0p2p1|⋅P(t)=24P(t).Moreover,F(x,y,w)≡det⁡(6x−3y+6w10x+3y+18w−10x−3y−18w2x+3y−6w)=0,is the implicit equation of the conicP(t).Remark 2When the conic curve is expressed in terms of the Bernstein basisP(t)=∑i=02piBi2(t)=∑i=02pi2!i!(2−i)!(1−t)2−iti,letpˆi=2!i!(2−i)!pi,i=0,1,2. Thenpˆ0×P(t)t=(pˆ0×pˆ1)(1−t)+(pˆ0×pˆ2)t,pˆ2×P(t)1−t=(pˆ2×pˆ0)(1−t)+(pˆ2×pˆ1)t.are a μ-basis for the conicP(t). Moreover, the implicit equation of the conic curveP(t)isF(x,y,w)≡det⁡((pˆ0×pˆ1)⋅X(pˆ0×pˆ2)⋅X(pˆ2×pˆ0)⋅X(pˆ2×pˆ1)⋅X)=0,whereX=(x,y,w).In this section we shall find explicit formulas for a μ-basis of an arbitrary planar rational cubic curve. We shall then use this μ-basis to find a closed formula for the double point and the implicit equation of the planar rational cubic curve.Consider a non-degenerate planar rational cubic curve in homogeneous form(8)P(t)=p0+p1t+p2t2+p3t3,wherepi∈R3. Notice thatp0≠0andp3≠0otherwise the cubic curveP(t)will degenerate into a conic or a line. SetM=(p0p1p2p3),where M is the3×4matrix whose columns are the four vectorsp0,p1,p2,p3. For the rational cubic curveP(t)to be non-degenerate we must have(9)Rank(M)=3.IfRank(M)<3, there is a constant vectorΓ≠0such thatΓ⋅pi=0,i=0,…,3. HenceΓ⋅P(t)≡0. Thus the cubic curve will degenerate into the lineΓ⋅(x,y,w)=0.Again by inspecting the matrix (6) based on Busé and Jouanolou (2003), one can derive the following closed formula for the implicitization matrix of the cubic curveP(t):(10)((p0×p3)⋅X(p0×p2)⋅X(p0×p1)⋅X(p1×p3)⋅X(p0×p3+p1×p2)⋅X(p0×p2)⋅X(p2×p3)⋅X(p1×p3)⋅X(p0×p3)⋅X).On the other hand, from (1) we can derive two different closed formulas for the implicitization matrices of the cubic curveP(t)based on an explicit μ-basis for the cubic curveP(t).Letu0(t),u1(t)be a μ-basis for the rational cubic curveP(t)withdeg⁡(u0(t))≤deg⁡(u1(t)). From the definition of a μ-basis, we know thatdeg⁡(u0(t))+deg⁡(u1(t))=deg⁡(P(t)). Thus for any μ-basis of the planar rational cubic curveP(t),deg⁡(u0(t))=1,deg⁡(u1(t))=2.Expressu0(t)andu1(t)in the power basis:u0(t)=u00+u01t,u1(t)=u10+u11t+u12t2.Thenu0(t)⋅X=u00⋅X+(u01⋅X)t,u1(t)⋅X=u10⋅X+(u11⋅X)t+(u12⋅X)t2,whereX=(x,y,w).Calculating the Sylvester matrix ofu0(t)⋅Xandu1(t)⋅Xwith respect to t yields an alternative form of the implicitization matrix for the cubic curveP(t):(11)(u00⋅X0u10⋅Xu01⋅Xu00⋅Xu11⋅X0u01⋅Xu12⋅X).Notice that the matrix in (11) is sparser than the matrix in (10). Moreover, calculating the Bezoutian matrix ofu0(t)⋅Xandu1(t)⋅Xwith respect to t yields a different implicitization matrix with smaller size for the cubic curveP(t):(12)(X(u00Tu12−u11Tu01)XTu01XT−X(u10Tu01)XTu00XT).Next we shall show case by case how to find explicit μ-bases for non-degenerate planar rational cubic curves. We shall consider three distinct cases.Supposep0×p3=0. Considerp3×P(t)=((p3×p1)+(p3×p2)t)t.In this casep3×p1≠0,p3×p2≠0. OtherwiseRank(M)<3which contradicts condition (9). Thus whenp0×p3=0,(13)p3×P(t)t=(p3×p1)+(p3×p2)tis a degree one syzygy forP(t)becausep3×P(t)⋅P(t)≡0.On the other hand,P(t)can be rewritten as(p0+p1t)+(p2+p3t)t2, so it is easy to check that(14)(p0+p1t)×(p2+p3t)also followsP(t). Expanding (14) yields(p0+p1t)×(p2+p3t)=p0×p2+(p1×p2)t+(p1×p3)t2.Computing the outer product of (13) and (14) and recalling that by assumptionp0×p3=0, we get(15)((p3×p1)+(p3×p2)t)×((p0+p1t)×(p2+p3t))=|p3p1p2|⋅P(t)where|p3p1p2|is a nonzero constant, otherwisep1,p2,p3are linearly dependent andRank(M)<3, which again contradicts condition (9). Thus from the definition of a μ-basis,(16)u0(t)=(p3×p1)+(p3×p2)t,u1(t)=p0×p2+(p1×p2)t+(p1×p3)t2are a μ-basis for the rational cubic curveP(t)whenp0×p3=0.Hence by (11), the determinant of the Sylvester matrix(17)((p3×p1)⋅X0(p0×p2)⋅X(p3×p2)⋅X(p3×p1)⋅X(p1×p2)⋅X0(p3×p2)⋅X(p1×p3)⋅X),represents the implicit equation of the rational cubic curveP(t). In addition, by (12), the determinant of the Bezoutian matrix(18)(X((p3×p1)T(p1×p3)−(p3×p2)T(p1×p2))XT(p3×p2)XT−X((p0×p2)T(p3×p2))XT(p3×p1)XT),also represents the implicit equation of the cubic curveP(t).Since((p3×p1)+(p3×p2)t)⋅p3≡0,it follows thatp3is the axial point of the linear moving line((p3×p1)+(p3×p2)t)⋅(x,y,w)=0. Hence by Theorem 2,p3is the unique double point of the rational cubic curveP(t).Example 2Consider the planar rational cubic curveP(t)=p0+p1t+p2t2+p3t3,wherep0=(3,2,−2),p1=(0,2,1),p2=(−3,4,1),p3=2p0. Clearlyp0×p3=0. Moreover,p3×p1=(12,−6,12),p3×p2=(20,6,36)p0×p2=(10,3,18),p1×p2=(−2,−3,6),p1×p3=(−12,6,−12).So in this case, by (17) and (18), the determinants of the matrices(12x−6y+12w010x+3y+18w20x+6y+36w12−6y+12w−2x−3y+6w020x+6y+36w−12x+6y−12w)and(−104x2+216yx−336xw−18y2+216yw−360w220x+6y+36w200x2+120yx+720xw+18y2+216yw+648w212x−6y+12w)both represent the implicit equation of the cubic curveP(t).In addition by (16),(p3×p1)+(p3×p2)t=(12+20t,−6+6t,12+36t),(p0+p1t)×(p2+p3t)=(10−2t−12t2,3−3t+6t2,18+6t−12t2)are a μ-basis for the cubic curveP(t). Indeed((p3×p1)+(p3×p2))×((p0+p1t)×(p2+p3t))=|p3p1p2|⋅P(t)=−48P(t).Finally,p3=(6,4,−4)is the unique double point of the cubic curveP(t).Supposep0×p3≠0. To construct two syzygies forP(t), set(19)Q(t)=p3×P(t)=(p3×p0)+(p3×p1)t+(p3×p2)t2,(20)Qˆ(t)=p0×P(t)t=(p0×p1)+(p0×p2)t+(p0×p3)t2.It is easy to check that bothQ(t)andQˆ(t)followP(t). Thus we get two syzygies forP(t). The relation between these two syzygies is explained in the following lemma.Lemma 3Consider a non-degenerate planar rational cubic curveP(t). Ifp0×p3≠0,Q(t)andQˆ(t)areR[t]-linearly independent.Calculating the outer product ofQ(t)andQˆ(t)yields(21)Q(t)×Qˆ(t)=(p3×P(t))×(p0×P(t)t)=(|p0p1p3|+|p0p2p3|t)P(t).IfQ(t)×Qˆ(t)≡0,|p0p1p3|=|p0p2p3|=0. But|p0p1p3|and|p0p2p3|cannot be zero simultaneously. Otherwise,p2=τ0p0+τ1p3,p1=τ2p0+τ3p3,for some constantsτi,i=0,1,2,3. ThusRank(M)≤2<3which contradicts condition (9). Therefore,Q(t)×Qˆ(t)≢0.Equivalently,Q(t),Qˆ(t)areR[t]-linearly independent.  □Qˆ(t)is a degree two syzygy forP(t)ifp0×p3≠0. ButQˆ(t)may sometimes have a linear factor.Lemma 4Consider a non-degenerate planar rational cubic curve(8). Supposep0×p3≠0. LetQˆ(t)be defined as in(20). ThenQˆ(t)can be factored intoα(t)l(t)for some linear polynomialα(t)if and only ifΔ=|p0p1p3|2−|p0p1p2|⋅|p0p2p3|=0.Moreover, ifΔ=0, thenα(t)=γ(|p0p1p3|+|p0p2p3|t)for some nonzero constant γ.(⇒) IfQˆ(t)=α(t)l(t)for some degree one polynomialα(t),Qˆ(t0)=(p0×p1)+(p0×p2)t0+(p0×p3)t02=0,wheret0is the root ofα(t). Calculating the dot product ofQˆ(t0)withp3andp2yields(22)Qˆ(t0)⋅p3=|p0p1p3|+|p0p2p3|t0=0,(23)Qˆ(t0)⋅p2=|p0p1p2|−|p0p2p3|t02=0.From (22), we get(24)|p0p2p3|t0=−|p0p1p3|Substituting (24) into (23) yields(25)|p0p1p2|+|p0p1p3|t0=0Sincet0satisfies (22) and (25) simultaneously, it follows thatΔ=0.(⇐) SupposeΔ=0. Then|p0p2p3|≠0.In other words,p0,p2,p3are linearly independent. Otherwise|p0p2p3|=|p0p1p3|=0. Thus bothp1andp2can be represented by linear combinations ofp0,p3in the case ofp0×p3≠0. SoRank(M)=2which contradicts condition (9).But ifΔ=0, there is a real parametert0that simultaneously satisfies (22) and (25). Hence the real parametert0also satisfies (23), since (23) can be expressed by a linear combination of (22) and (25) asQˆ(t0)⋅p2=(|p0p1p2|+|p0p1p3|t0)−t0(|p0p1p3|+det⁡(p0p2p3)t0).Thus there is a real parametert0that satisfies (22) and (23) simultaneously. From (22) and (23), we getQˆ(t0)⊥p2,Qˆ(t0)⊥p3. On the other hand, from the definition ofQˆ(t),Qˆ(t0)⊥p0. Butp0,p2,p3are linearly independent, soQˆ(t0)=0. ThusQˆ(t)has a linear factorγ1(t−t0)for some nonzero constantγ1.The parametert0also satisfies (22), so|p0p1p3|+|p0p2p3|t=|p0p2p3|(t−t0).Henceα(t)=γ(|p0p1p3|+|p0p2p3|t),whereγ=γ1/|p0p2p3|.  □IfΔ=0, then it follows from Lemma 4 thatQˆ(t)can be expressed asQˆ(t)=(|p0p1p3|+|p0p2p3|t)⋅(l0+l1t),wherel0,l1∈R3. Recall thatQˆ(t)is defined asQˆ(t)=(p0×p1)+(p0×p2)t+(p0×p3)t2.Sol0=p0×p1|p0p1p3|,l1=p0×p3|p0p2p3|.Thus(26)L0(t)=Qˆ(t)/(|p0p1p3|+|p0p2p3|t)=l0+l1tis a degree one syzygy forP(t). Since by Lemma 3,Q(t),Qˆ(t)areR[t]-linearly independent, it is easy to show thatL0(t),Q(t)are alsoR[t]-linearly independent. Thus in the case ofΔ=0,u0(t)=L0(t),u1(t)=Q(t)are a μ-basis forP(t).Again by (11) and (12), the determinant of the Sylvester matrix(27)(l0⋅X0(p3×p0)⋅Xl1⋅Xl0⋅X(p3×p1)⋅X0l1⋅X(p3×p2)⋅X),and the determinant of the Bezoutian matrix(28)(X(l0T(p3×p2)−(p3×p1)Tl1)XTl1XT−X(l1T(p3×p0))XTl0XT),both represent the implicit equation of the cubic curveP(t).Using (26), it is easy to check thatL0(t)⋅p0≡0,sop0is the axis of the linear moving lineL0(t)⋅(x,y,w)=0. Thus again by Theorem 2,p0is the unique double point of the rational cubic curveP(t).Example 3Consider the planar rational cubic curveP(t)=p0+p1t+p2t2+p3t3,wherep0=(3,2,−2),p1=(14,0,−2),p2=(−3,4,1),p3=(−2,−2,0).After a straightforward calculation, we find that|p0p1p3|=52,|p0p1p2|=−104,|p0p2p3|=−26.HenceΔ=|p0p1p3|2−|p0p1p2||p0p2p3|=0. Nowp3×p0=(4,−4,2),p3×p1=(4,−4,28),p3×p2=(−2,2,−14),l0=p0×p1|p0p1p3|=(−113,−1126,−713),l1=p0×p3|p0p2p3|=(213,−213,113).So in this case, we can get a degree one syzygyL0(t)=l0+l1t=(−113+213t,−1126−213t,−713+113t)and a degree two syzygyQ(t)=p3×p0+(p3×p1)t+(p3×p2)t2=(4+4t−2t2,−4−4t+2t2,2+28t−14t2).It is also easy to check thatL0(t)×Q(t)=−P(t).HenceL0(t),Q(t)are a μ-basis forP(t). Clearing the denominator inL0(t), we getL˜0(t)=26L0(t)=(4t−2,−4t−11,2t−14).HenceL˜0(t),Q(t)are also a μ-basis forP(t).By (11) and (12), the determinants of the matrices(−2x−11y−14w04x−4y+2w4x−4y+2w−2x−11y−14w4x−4y+28w04x−4y+2w−2x+2y−14w)and(−12x2+50xy−64xw−38y2+246yw+140w24x−4y+2w−16x2+32xy−16xw−16y2+16yw−4w2−2x−11y−14w)both represent the implicit equation of the cubic curveP(t).In addition,p0=(3,2,−2)is the unique double point of the rational cubic curveP(t).IfΔ≠0, we cannot get a degree one syzygy directly fromQˆ(t)as in (26). Instead set(29)L1(t)=(p0×q0)+(p3×q1)t,where(30)q0=λ0p1+λ1p2+λ2p3,q1=−λ1p0−λ2p1+λ3p2,λ0=|p1p3p2|,λ1=|p0p2p3|,λ2=−|p0p1p3|,λ3=−|p0p1p2|.Now it is straightforward to check thatL1(t)⋅P(t)≡0.ThusL1(t)followsP(t). Calculating the outer product ofL1(t)andQˆ(t), we find that((p0×q0)+(p3×q1)t)×((p0×p1)+(p0×p2)t+(p0×p3)t2)=Δ⋅P(t).Since by assumptionΔ≠0, it follows from the definition of a μ-basis that(31)u0(t)=L1(t),u1(t)=Qˆ(t)are a μ-basis forP(t).Again by (11) and (12), the determinant of the Sylvester matrix(32)((p0×q0)⋅X0(p0×p1)⋅X(p3×q1)⋅X(p0×q0)⋅X(p0×p2)⋅X0(p3×q1)⋅X(p0×p3)⋅X)and the determinant of Bezoutian matrix(33)(X((p0×q0)T(p0×p3)−(p0×p2)T(p3×q1))XT(p3×q1)XT−X((p3×q1)T(p0×p1))XT(p0×q0)XT)both represent the implicit equation of the cubic curveP(t).In addition, since((p0×q0)×(p3×q1))⋅L1(t)≡0, it follows that(p0×q0)×(p3×q1)is the axis of the linear moving lineL1(t)⋅(x,y,w)=0. Thus by Theorem 2,((p0×q0)×(p3×q1))is the unique double point of the rational cubic curveP(t).Example 4Consider the planar rational cubic curveP(t)=p0+p1t+p2t2+p3t3,wherep0=(3,2,−2),p1=(0,2,1),p2=(−3,4,1),p3=(−2,−2,0). After a straightforward calculation, we getλ0=|p1p3p2|=−10,λ1=|p0p2p3|=−26,λ2=−|p0p1p3|=6,λ3=−|p0p1p2|=24,soΔ=−588≠0. Henceq0=λ0p1+λ1p2+λ2p3=(66,−136,−36),q1=−λ1p0−λ2p1+λ3p2=(6,136,−34),p0×q0=(−344,−24,−540),p3×q1=(68,−68,−260),p0×p1=(6,−3,6),p0×p2=(10,3,18),p0×p3=(−4,4,−2).Thus by (32) and (33), the determinants of the matrices(−344x−24y−540w06x−3y+6w68x−68y−260w−344x−24y−540w10x+3y+18w068x−68y−260w−4x+4y−2w)and(696x2−804xy+4224xw+108y2−108yw+5760w268x−68y−260w−408x2+612xy+1152xw−204y2−372yw+1560w2−344x−24y−540w)both represent the implicit equation of the cubic curveP(t).In addition by (31),L1(t)=(p0×q0)+(p3×q1)t=(−344+68t,−24−68t,−540−260t)Qˆ(t)=(p0×p1)+(p0×p2)t+(p0×p3)t2=(6+10t−4t2,−3+3t+4t2,6+18t−2t2)are a μ-basis forP(t). Computing the outer product ofL1(t)andQˆ(t)yieldsL1(t)×Qˆ(t)=Δ⋅P(t)=−588P(t).Finally,(p0×q0)×(p3×q1)=16(−1905,−7885,1564). So the point(−1905,−7885,1564)is the unique double point of the rational cubic curveP(t).Remark 3When the planar rational cubic curve is expressed in terms of the Bernstein basisP(t)=∑i=03piBi3(t)=∑i=03pi3!i!(3−i)!(1−t)3−iti,letpˆi=3!i!(3−i)!pi,i=0,…,3and setQ(t)=p3×P(t)1−t=(p3×p0)(1−t)2+(p3×p1)(1−t)t+(p3×p2)t2,Qˆ(t)=p0×P(t)t=(p0×p1)(1−t)2+(p0×p2)(1−t)t+(p0×p3)t2.We can prove in a similar fashion that•Ifpˆ0×pˆ3=0, then(pˆ3×pˆ1)(1−t)+(pˆ3×pˆ2)t,(pˆ0(1−t)+pˆ1t)×(pˆ2(1−t)+pˆ3t)are a μ-basis for the planar rational cubic curveP(t). Moreover,p3is the unique double point ofP(t).Ifpˆ0×pˆ3≠0andΔˆ=|pˆ0pˆ1pˆ3|2−|pˆ0pˆ1pˆ2|⋅|pˆ0pˆ2pˆ3|=0, thenL0(t)=Qˆ(t)/(|pˆ0pˆ1pˆ3|(1−t)+|pˆ0pˆ2pˆ3|t),Q(t)are a μ-basis for the planar rational cubic curveP(t). Moreover,p0is the unique double point ofP(t).Ifpˆ0×pˆ3≠0andΔˆ≠0, thenL1(t)=(pˆ0×qˆ0)(1−t)+(pˆ3×qˆ1)t,Qˆ(t)are a μ-basis for the planar rational cubic curveP(t), whereqˆ0=λ0pˆ1+λ1pˆ2+λ2pˆ3,qˆ1=−λ1pˆ0−λ2pˆ1+λ3pˆ2,λ0=|pˆ1pˆ3pˆ2|,λ1=|pˆ0pˆ2pˆ3|,λ2=−|pˆ0pˆ1pˆ3|,λ3=−|pˆ0pˆ1pˆ2|.Moreover,(pˆ0×qˆ0)×(pˆ3×qˆ1)is the unique double point ofP(t).In this section, we shall generalize our result about μ-bases for conics in 2-dimensions to degree n(n≥3)rational curves in n-dimensions by constructing explicit μ-bases for degree n rational curves in n-dimensions (e.g., rational cubic curves in 3-dimensions).Since in Section 2 we gave the definition of μ-bases only for planar rational curves, we need to recall here the concept of μ-bases for rational space curves. Consider a real rational space curveF(t)=(f0(t),f1(t),…,fn(t)),(n≥3),in homogeneous form, wheregcd⁡(f0(t),f1(t),…,fn(t))=1. The curveF(t)is a rational curve in n-dimensions. A syzygy ofF(t)is a vector of polynomialsL(t)=(l0(t),l1(t),…,ln(t))such thatL(t)⋅F(t)≡0. The set of all syzygies ofF(t)is once again a free module overR[t]with a basis consisting of n generators (Cox et al., 1998). There are also several equivalent definitions for a μ-basis of a rational space curveF(t)(Song and Goldman, 2009). One simple definition of μ-bases for rational space curves is as follows.Definition 5(See Song and Goldman, 2009.) Consider a rational curveF(t)in n-dimensions. A set of n syzygiesu0(t),…,un−1(t)ofF(t)is a μ-basis forF(t)if1)deg⁡(u0(t))+⋯+deg⁡(un−1(t))=deg⁡(F(t)),[u0(t),…,un−1(t)]=λF(t)for some nonzero constant λ.Here the outer product[u0(t),…,un−1(t)]of n vectorsu0(t),…,un−1(t)is the(n+1)-tuple defined by[u0(t),…,un−1(t)]=det⁡(e0e1⋯enu0,0u0,1⋯u0,n⋮⋮⋮⋮un−1,0un−1,1⋯un−1,n),wheree0,e1,…,enare the unit vectors along the coordinate axes, andui,jdenotes the j-th element ofui(t).Every rational space curve has a μ-basis. Moreover, the method to compute μ-bases for planar rational curves, which is based on Gaussian Elimination (Chen and Wang, 2003), has also been generalized to compute μ-bases for rational space curves in n-dimensions (Song and Goldman, 2009).Next we shall show how to find μ-bases for degree n rational space curves in n-dimensions.Consider a non-degenerate degree n rational curve in n-dimensionsF(t)=(f0(t),f1(t),…,fn(t)),(n≥3),in homogeneous form. The curveF(t)can be expressed in terms of the power basisF(t)=p0+p1t+…+pntn,wherepi∈Rn+1. Let(34)M˜=(p0,p1,…,pn),be the(n+1)×(n+1)matrix whose columns are then+1vectorsp0,p1,…,pn. ForF(t)to be a non-degenerate rational space curve we must haveRank(M˜)=n+1. That is,(35)det⁡(M˜)≠0.Otherwise ifdet⁡(M˜)=0, there is a constant vectorΓ≠0such thatΓ⋅pi=0,i=0,…,n. HenceΓ⋅F(t)≡0. Thus the rational space curveF(t)will degenerate into a rational curve that lies in the(n−1)-dimensional hyperplane perpendicular to the vector Γ.Notice thatF(t)=(f0(t),f1(t),…,fn(t))can be rewritten as(f0(t),f1(t),…,fn(t))=(1,t,t2,…,tn)M˜T,whereM˜Tis the transpose of the matrixM˜(34). Moreover the(n+1)×nmatrixR=(t0⋯0−1t⋯00−1⋮⋮⋮t00⋯−1)satisfies(1,t,t2,…,tn)R=0.Thus the columns of the matrix R are orthogonal to(1,t,…,tn)and form a μ-basis for the normal curve(1,t,…,tn). Similarly, the columns of the matrix(M˜T)−1Rare orthogonal toF(t)and form a μ-basis for the curveF(t). There are several efficient methods to compute the inverse of the matrixM˜Tin practice, e.g., solving the linear system corresponding toM˜T.Our goal here, however, is to find an explicit formula for a μ-basis of the curveF(t). To find such an explicit formula, we can simply compute the adjoint matrix ofM˜T. It is easy to verify that the adjoint matrix ofM˜Tis(M˜T)⁎=(c0,−c1,…,(−1)ici,…,(−1)ncn),whereci=[p0,…,pi−1,pi+1,pi+2,…,pn],i=0,…,n.Hence(M˜T)⁎R=(c1+c0t,c2+c1t,…,cn+cn−1t).Therefore,(36)c1+c0t,c2+c1t,…,cn+cn−1tis an explicit μ-basis for the curveF(t).Alternatively, we can also reconstruct an explicit formula for a μ-basis of the rational space curveF(t)as we did for conic curves in Section 3. SetLi(t)=[p0,…,pi−1,F(t),pi+2,…,pn]ti,i=0,…,n−1.Li(t)followsF(t)since[p0,…,pi−1,F(t),pi+2,…,pn]⊥F(t).After a simple computation, it is easy to show thatLi(t)can also be expressed byLi(t)=ci+1+cit,i=0,…,n−1.Obviously,L0(t),…,Ln−1(t)are equal to (36).Example 5Consider the rational cubic space curveF(t)=p0+p1t+p2t2+p3t3, wherep0=(1,3,3,−2),p1=(1,2,−2,−1),p2=(0,0,2,1),p3=(−1,−3,1,−2).F(t)is a rational curve in 3-dimensions. After a straightforward calculation, we find thatdet⁡(M˜)=det⁡((p0T,p1T,p2T,p3T))=12.SetL0(t)=[F(t),p2,p3]=(−36−10t,12+5t,t,−2t),L1(t)=[p0,F(t),p3]t=(44−36t,−16+12t,4,4),L2(t)=[p0,p1,F(t)]t2=(−14+44t,7−16t,−1+4t,2+4t).By construction,Li(t)⋅F(t)≡0,i=0,1,2. On the other hand,[L0(t),L1(t),L2(t)]=det⁡(M˜)2F(t)=144F(t).ThusL0(t),L1(t),L2(t)are indeed a μ-basis for the rational cubic space curveF(t).Remark 4Conics discussed in Section 3 are a special case of degree n rational curves in n-dimensions wheren=2.Remark 5When a degree n rational curve in n-dimensions(n≥2)is expressed in terms of the Bernstein basisF(t)=∑i=0npiBin(t)=∑i=0npin!i!(n−i)!(1−t)n−iti,wherepi∈Rn+1. Setpˆi=n!i!(n−i)!pi,i=0,…,n, and letci=[pˆ0,…,pˆi−1,pˆi+1,…,pˆn],i=0,…,n.Then once again we can prove thatLi(t)=ci+1(1−t)+cit,i=0,…,n−1,are a μ-basis forF(t).
