Hearing the way: Requirements and preferences for technology-supported navigation aids

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Technology-supported navigation aids can support users with sight problems.Users should have control over cues provided by the technology.The cues provided should be assimilated with the environment.The technology should support the environmental cues rather than replacing them.Information when users are not on the correct path is particularly important.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Many systems have been developed to assist wayfinding for people with sight problems. There is a need for user requirements for such systems to be defined. This paper presents a study which aimed to determine such user requirements. An experiment was also conducted to establish the best way of guiding users between locations. The focus group results indicated that users require systems to provide them with information about their surroundings, to guide them along their route and to provide progress information. They also showed that users with sight conditions interact with systems differently to sighted users, thereby highlighting the importance of designing systems for the needs of these users. Results of the experiment found that the preferred method of guiding users was a notification when they were both on and off track. However, performance was best when only provided with the off track notification, implying that this cue is particularly important. Technology has the potential to support navigation for people with sight problems. Users should have control over cues provided and for these cues should supplement environmental cues rather than replacing them.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Blind and partially sighted people face difficulty in both navigating through environments and knowing what is in their environment. This can lead to reductions in their mobility, increased danger and decreased independence (Walker and Lindsay, 2006). Previous work has suggested that blind and partially sighted people heavily rely on help from other people in unfamiliar places and face particular challenges in navigation in noisy environments (Saenz and Sanchez, 1990). This suggests that orientation may be aided through the provision of directions along the person's route. In addition, there are instances where sighted people may be unable to use vision to aid navigation due to carrying out other tasks which require sight simultaneously (Walker and Lindsay, 2006).Location based handheld technologies provide an opportunity to use technology to support navigation using non-visual presentations. This may therefore support blind, partially sighted and sighted users. This paper presents a study that developed some prototype methods to support blind and partially sighted users in a navigation task. The methods were derived using a user requirements exercise that considered technology capabilities and limitations, user preferences and needs and views of experts. The methods were then compared in an experiment that simulated the navigation task of moving from one checkpoint to the next for blind and partially sighted users. On the basis of the findings of this research, the way in which different user needs were met was considered along with any improvements to the prototypes methods and identification of areas for future research.
