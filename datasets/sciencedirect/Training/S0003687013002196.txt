@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The current work presents results from a cognitive task analysis (CTA) of a nuclear disaster simulation. Audio-visual records were collected from an emergency room team composed of individuals from 26 different agencies as they responded to multiple scenarios in a simulated nuclear disaster. This simulation was part of a national emergency response training activity for a nuclear power plant located in a developing country. The objectives of this paper are to describe sources of resilience and brittleness in these activities, identify cues of potential improvements for future emergency simulations, and leveraging the resilience of the emergency response system in case of a real disaster. Multiple CTA techniques were used to gain a better understanding of the cognitive dimensions of the activity and to identify team coordination and crisis management patterns that emerged from the simulation exercises.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recent disasters such as the Columbia loss, the 9.11 terrorist attacks, the Katrina hurricane, and the Fukushima nuclear accident were high-surprise events in which organizations were caught in response situations where previous training, established tactics, or well defined procedures simply do not exist. Under such situations, new failure conditions challenge existing emergency plans, safety systems, and organizations, and achieving high levels of performance in responding to these challenges in high risk and complex systems requires resilience, including the ability to act in situations of surprise (Hollnagel et al., 2006).Large-scale socio-technical organizations that use risk technologies attempt to enhance their capacity to deal with disasters by practicing emergency response using simulations. Domains in which safety is paramount, like aviation, chemical, and nuclear plants use simulation because simulations of accident or abnormal situations are the only way to prepare people to deal with events/situations that are unlikely to occur in reality. Simulation offers opportunities to design new technologies (Carvalho et al., 2008), to train operators, to test existing procedures (Carvalho and Oliveira, 2009), and in the case of emergency response simulations, to prepare agencies and people to better respond to a real emergency. Some types of simulation can offer high fidelity, even in a controlled environment, to better reproduce rare and critical situations. Such simulations have been widely used to test Nuclear Power Plants' (NPPs) emergency response plans, as part of their licensing requirements.Simulation training can present opportunities for organizations to work on human factors, such as group dynamics, and to explore how the organization might respond to hitherto unelaborated conditions or surprises. It is still often the case, however, that training and simulation exercises seek principally to show and develop individual competency to deal with prescribed and well defined emergency situations, not addressing human factors and response to surprises specifically (Malakis and Kontogiannis, 2008; Takahashi and Kitamura, 2013).According to Klein (2001) team coordination is the attempt by multiple entities to act in concert in order to achieve a common goal by carrying out a script/plan they all understand. Good team coordination is paramount for an adequate nuclear emergency response. Large-scale socio-technical organizations might be more resilient if they used the opportunities provided by these exercises and simulations to more effectively capture learning and to facilitate a deeper understanding of the cognitive work and team coordination in the domain (Malakis and Kontogiannis, 2008; Voshell et al., 2008).A critical aspect of these run-throughs is practicing teamwork and coordination over multiple groups in different facilities as the simulated disaster evolves and cascades (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006). In addition, how well teams work together and the difficulties they encounter in these simulated cases provide information about sources of resilience and brittle points in the emergency response system. The deployment of an Emergency Plan requires complex cognitive and collaborative skills, and a variety of Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) techniques can be used to extract information about these skills from the resources available (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006; Crandall et al., 2006), and to learn more about the domain challenges, which is our focus in this research.In Brazil, we are applying CTA techniques to the nuclear incident emergency response exercises to investigate emergency management issues, such as the decision-making of the emergency response coordinator (Voshell et al., 2008). We used the CTA approach to identify sources of resilience and brittleness, analyzing how the team handled the emergency response simulation exercise. Identifying the sources of resilience and brittleness helps provide indicators of the emergency response system's level of resilience and can suggest design directions such that future emergency response simulation exercises help enhance team performance by including group dynamics and exploration of responses to surprises in the exercise plan.Since the first atomic reactor created by Enrico Fermi in 1942, safety aspects are an important part in the development and operation of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) (Martin, 2002). The defense-in-depth (D2) safety approach used in NPPs aims to avoid the liberation of fission products to the environment in case of a major nuclear accident (WNA, 2008). Emergency response measures are included under the D2 approach and it must be taken when all physical barriers fail, resulting in the liberation of radioactive materials into the environment. In a nuclear accident scenario, with radioactive release to the environment, emergency measures are taken and people must be evacuated from the vicinity of the plant, as occurred in the recent Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. Therefore consistent emergency response systems must be included in the overall safety approach of the nuclear power plants, and to deliver a license for NPP operation, government and regulatory authorities would have to assess the plant emergency response systems, as well as they access the physical safety barriers.Emergency response measures and plans aim to handle the potential damage that a nuclear disaster may cause, and response agencies must be prepared and capable to stabilize an accident, protect life and the environment, and be prepared for command, control and coordination of a response in order to coordinate efforts toward a common goal (FEMA, 2006). One of the most important measures to respond to a nuclear major accident is the External Emergency Plan (EEP), where local governments, agencies and people concerned work together in a previously defined place, outside the Nuclear Power plant, to follow the evolution and consequences of the accident, to classify and distinguish local ranges of accidents and to take measures and procedures to mitigate the consequences of a Nuclear accident for people and for the environment.The nuclear emergency management regulations in Brazil are similar to the worldwide regulations and the EEP is centered on the notion of Emergency Planning Zones (EPZs), circle areas within 3, 5, 10 and 15 km of the nuclear power plant in which people might be more seriously and immediately affected by direct radiation exposure, shown in Fig. 1. The EEP has different measures according to the severity of accident and different actions according to each EPZ. In case of radiation release the EEP has urgent measures to remove the population from the EPZ-3 (in a radius of 3 km from the NPP), and from NPP-5. The EPZ 10 and 15 are considered environmental control zones, where urgent protection measures (such as population removal) are not planned, and in these zones there is only environmental monitoring. The Civil Defense estimates that there are 300 people in EPZ-3 ad 14,640 people in EPZ-5.Responsibility for the communication of risk and the formulation of emergency plans in the EPZ is left to the utility company running the nuclear complex, in conjunction with state and local police, fire, and civil defense authorities, and the local Civil Defense is responsible by the EEP conduction. The plans must be approved by the Brazilian Nuclear Regulatory Commission (CNEN). Another important regulation involves classes of Emergency Action Levels (EALs), that is, levels of response to an accident. These levels range from minor events involving no public danger (Unusual Event) to progressively more serious occurrences that may require immediate response actions (Alert, Site Area Emergency and General Emergency). EALs are declared by plant operators and elicit responses by emergency planners, who recommend response actions to people living in an EPZ. Only in case of General Emergency – actual or possible (immediate) indication of radioactive material release – the population of EPZ-3 and eventually of EPZ-5 will be removed from the zones.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In the current study we have used CTA techniques to look for possible sources of resilience and brittleness in a nuclear emergency response situation by analyzing a simulation exercise. Our analysis found sources of resilience and brittleness related to team coordination, simulation dynamics, and crisis response activities producing a deeper understanding of cognition at work in the nuclear emergency domain. Knowing and understanding these sources of resilience and brittleness in a system is useful to better understand how and why activities are successful or unsuccessful, and factors that may compromise system performance. The results obtained through this analysis additionally suggest that areas such as workspace redesign, visual and communication technology support are areas with high potential for improvements in emergency response and its simulation.To examine the sources of resilience and brittleness in emergency response situations, further studies and research are planned. We believe this further research will support the enhancement of resilience and mitigation of brittleness, or even the transformation of sources of brittleness into sources of resilience, in other emergency response situations and simulations. There are challenges on how to stage such exercises and develop CTA methods so that researchers will be able to learn and abstract from these field observations.Relevant constraints on this research were the sensitivity of the domain and shortcomings inherent in the material resources available to perform the analysis. The audio and video recordings covered only a small area of the coordination center situation room. Because of this, analysis was restricted to the agents involved in the most important actions in each event. Also, although the recordings covered most of the simulation activities, it did cover them in their entirety.It is important to note that many of our recommendations for improvement are not related to the emergency response activities, but, rather, are hints of issues to improve the simulation exercise. We hope that our approach examining many exercise challenges from multiple perspectives in this research help future simulation designers and researchers to effectively capture and explore learning opportunities during new simulations, and to support resilient processes for planning and conducting staged world exercises. Planning of emergency exercises needs to be resilient because when one scales up, given the use of distributed groups, spatially separated agents, and multi-hour and multi-day work environments, as required in a complete nuclear emergency simulation, unanticipated disruptions and changes will make sure events do not go as planned, as has already occurred in the exercise we observed.We conclude by observing that most studies of emergency response simulation in nuclear power plants have been undertaken in developed countries, in which the cultural issues that enable people to follow rules and instructions may be quite different than we have in developing countries. Further studies about nuclear power plant emergency response issues in developing countries are important because such countries are socially, culturally and economically different from developed countries and these differences imply different demands on agents, organizations and the organization among them in the emergency response context.
