@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The field of economics associates capacity planning with economic scale size and finds the characteristics of the production function whereas the operations management community focuses on demand fulfillment to reduce the loss of sales or inventory for profit maximization. However, there is a troublesome capacity trade-off for firms that need to achieve economic scale size and demand fulfillment simultaneously; in particular, a firm's demand is variable and some of the variation is random. This study proposes a multi-objective mathematical program with data envelopment analysis (DEA) constraints to set an efficient target which shows a trade-off between the most-productive-scale-size (MPSS) benchmark and a potential demand fulfillment benchmark. The study also employs the minimax regret (MMR) approach and the stochastic programming (SP) technique to address target variations caused by demand fluctuations. The result shows how capacity planning via the proposed models can help managers address the capacity dilemma.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The capacity of a plant is defined as the maximum number of units that the plant can produce in a given time (Nahmias, 2009). The goal of capacity planning is to provide the supply that exactly matches the level of demand. However, due to the nature of demand fluctuation, capacity planning becomes a complex issue since capital investment is irreversible or costly (Abel & Eberly, 1996).One important issue related to capacity planning decisions is: should we base our capacity planning on our firm's economic scale size or on chasing the demand? The field of economics says that determining the optimal scale, in particular, the most productive scale size (MPSS), presenting the point maximizing the ratio of total output to total input, implies a potential cost advantage, because the fixed costs are spread out over more units of output when increasing scale size and the average product goes down after the MPSS point (Banker, 1984). On the other hand, the operations management community favors demand fulfillment, which can reduce the mismatch, which causes either a capacity shortage or a capacity surplus, between supply and demand. Demand fulfillment leads to revenue maximization, because selling more products creates profits and conserves resources. However, in practice, demand fluctuation causes a gap between supply and demand; thus, when the firm may not achieve MPSS and demand fulfillment objectives simultaneously, operations management encounters a capacity dilemma (i.e., a trade-off between MPSS and demand fulfillment).MPSS can be identified on the efficient surface of the production possibility set (PPS), which is defined by the production function. The production function is the function on the set of inputs whose value is the maximum possible output for a given set of inputs. It is nonnegative, nondecreasing, and a firm produces zero output when all inputs are zero (Coelli, Prasada Rao, O'Donnell, & Battese, 2005). Banker (1984) defined that the MPSS for a given input and output mix is the scale size at which the outputs produced per unit of the inputs is maximized. He showed that MPSS is equivalent to the benchmark on a constant-returns-to-scale (CRS) frontier, i.e., when increasing all inputs results in the same proportional increase in output. Letx∈R+Idenote the input vector andy∈R+Jdenote the output vector of the production system. Define the production possibility set (PPS) asT={(x,y):xcanproducey}. Thus, based on Banker's definition, the point (x, y) ∈ T is MPSS if and only if for every (ax, by) ∈ T we have a ≥ b (Banker, Cooper, Seiford, Thrall, & Zhu, 2004; Khodabakhshi, 2009). In other words, marginal product may be increasing for small values of input but must be diminishing for values of input exceeding those of any point in MPSS (Lee & Johnson, 2013).In the previous studies, Banker (1984) described a data envelopment analysis (DEA) method identifying the MPSS via CRS efficient frontier. It implies that a DEA model gives a MPSS set containing a range of points based on different input mixes and output mixes. Banker, Chang, and Cooper (1996) developed a modified CRS DEA model that can identify the MPSS, however, this method may provide multiple optimal solutions and the target cannot be determined uniquely. Appa and Yue (1999), who provided different DEA formulations that set a unique scale target under both input-oriented and output-oriented DEA models with single output, indicated that their unique scale targets corresponded to either the largest MPSS (i.e., a MPSS point with the maximal output) or the smallest MPSS (i.e., a MPSS point with the minimal output). An alternative approach by Zhu (2000) can control to identify the largest MPSS or the smallest MPSS. Fukuyama (2003) extended the scale return notions into a directional distance function framework (Chambers, Chung, & Färe, 1996) by generalizing Banker's MPSS concept and presenting a directional technology scale elasticity formula.Fig. 1shows a capacity dilemma between MPSS and demand fulfillment. The figure illustrates for one input and one output the simplest general case of the production function with a minimum scale of input below which output is not possible. Since the true production function cannot be observed, the variable-returns-to-scale (VRS) frontier is fitted and is good enough for practical purposes to approximate the frontier from limited data. Firm A faces a capacity dilemma on a single-input and single-output production function. The curve describes the production function and the dashed line is the CRS frontier that identifies the MPSS benchmark (Banker, 1984). DAindicates Firm A's forecast demand and truncates the production function by the set of pointsDF(i.e., demand fulfillment). Since Fig. 1 is an illustration example and we do not consider the time or seasonal effect, the forecast demand is just the estimated total demand over a planning period of interest. Note that different firms may have different forecast demands. Located below the production function, Firm A represents inefficiency and faces a capacity dilemma between MPSS and demand fulfillment. Firm A should attempt to adjust inputs and outputs to move to a point on the production frontier. But any point on the frontier between its MPSS benchmark andDFis plausible.Discussing “MPSS versus demand fulfillment” provides interesting managerial insights like “profitability versus profit”. Profit is the difference between revenue and cost, and profitability is the ratio of revenue to cost. From the perspective of production economics, profitability is a more reasonable index to assess productivity, because the profitability function is homogenous of degree zero in prices. Namely, while the price doubles, the profit doubles, but the profitability does not change. This unscaled nature of profitability is similar to productivity and represents the input-to-output performance (Lee & Johnson, 2012). It implies that MPSS is insensitive to demand variation and provides the justification for a risk-averse decision-maker to set a target toward MPSS in order to reduce uncertainty, unlike a risk-seeking decision-maker who prefers chasing demand for profit maximization.This study proposes a multi-objective decision analysis (MODA) model embedded with DEA constraints to release the dilemma and provide a compromise solution. We consider the demand factor and use mathematical programming to identify an efficient benchmark on the production function that represents a trade-off between MPSS and demand fulfillment. Due to the random demand and limited information about the distribution of possible values, we propose three approaches to address decision under uncertainty without the probability distribution of forecast demand: a minimax regret (MMR) (Savage, 1951) provides a conservative target to avoid the worst case via regret quantification, an expected value (EV) technique calculates the expected value of forecast demands based on the principle of indifference (Keynes, 1921) (i.e., all demand scenarios occur with equal probability), and a stochastic programming (SP) finds a robust solution based on the principle of indifference.This study makes two contributions to the literature. First, we address the capacity dilemma between the MPSS and demand fulfillment by combining DEA and MODA to develop a compromise solution. We set a target on the production function and move toward it in order to guide capacity planning decisions. The trade-off choice between a MPSS (cost-oriented) strategy and a demand-chasing (revenue-oriented) strategy shows the risk preference of the decision-maker. Second, we develop the MMR model, EV model and SP technique when addressing decision under uncertainty in forecast demand and the solution comparison of the proposed models supplies useful managerial insights.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a DEA model to identify MPSS. Section 3 proposes a compromise target between MPSS and deterministic demand and discusses three separate cases. Section 4 considers demand uncertainty and introduces the MMR model and SP technique. Section 5 gives a numerical example, and Section 6 concludes.As mentioned, Banker (1984) shows that MPSS is equivalent to the efficient benchmark on a constant-returns-to-scale (CRS) frontier, as shown in Fig. 1. This study considers the single-output production function. The PPS can be estimated by DEA (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984). In particular, CRS DEA can be used to identify the MPSS and variable-returns-to-scale (VRS) can be used to estimate piece-wise linear concave frontier enveloping all observations. We describe VRS DEA and CRS DEA as follows.First, we estimate the variable-returns-to-scale (VRS) frontier. It is the frontier of the production possibility set whose elements produce no more output using at least as much input as some convex combination of observations. There are K firms that produce single output from I inputs. The ith input and single output for firm k are denoted Xikand Yk. λkis the convex-combination multiplier of the kth firm. The VRS PPST˜VRSis defined by Eq. (1).(1)T˜VRS={(x,y)|∑k=1KλkYk≥y;∑k=1KλkXik≤xi,∀i∈{1,…,I};∑k=1Kλk=1;λk≥0,∀k∈{1,…,K}}Define the distance functionDVRS(x,y)=min{θ|(θx,y)∈T˜VRS,θ≤1}. Thus, for a specific firm k, we can measure the VRS input-oriented efficiencyθkVRS=DVRS(xk,yk), and a point (xk, yk) is on the VRS efficient frontier ifDVRS(xk,yk)=1, wherexk=(X1k,…,XIk).Similarly, the CRS PPST˜CRSis defined by Eq. (2).(2)T˜CRS={(x,y)|∑k=1KλkYk≥y;∑k=1KλkXik≤xi,∀i∈{1,…,I};λk≥0,∀k∈{1,…,K}}Define the distance functionDCRS(x,y)=min{θ|(θx,y)∈T˜CRS,θ≤1}. Thus, for a specific firm k, we can measure the CRS input-oriented efficiencyθkCRS=DCRS(xk,yk), and a point (xk, yk) is on the CRS efficient frontier ifDCRS(xk,yk)=1. Banker (1984) claimed that this efficiency measure DCRS(x, y) captures both the technical inefficiency of a firm and any inefficiency due to the difference of its actual scale size from MPSS.To investigate the discrete MPSS points as completely as possible (i.e., approximate the MPSS set) and guarantee the MPSS points on the VRS frontier, we need to develop the following procedure which identifies the MPSS point corresponding to each observation. Based on VRS efficiency measure, project all of the inefficient firms to their efficient benchmarks on the VRS frontier. That is, after Eq. (1) that(θkVRS*xk,yk)is an efficient benchmark for firm k because it is a point on the efficient frontier that produces the same output with no more of each input. Thus, we can identify the set of MPSS points(θkVRS*xk,yk)that satisfyDCRS(θkVRS*xk,yk)=1, and note that this is usually a finite subset of the infinite set of MPSS points.11DCRS(x,y)may generate potential multiple optimal solutions of MPSS. Banker et al. (1996), Appa and Yue (1999), and Zhu (2000) proposed methods to identify unique MPSS in DEA. However, this issue will not affect the MPSS identification in this study.For a two-input and one-output case the dashed red line named discrete subset of MPSS points in Fig. 2shows the MPSS set of which the set of MPSS points just identified as a discrete subset.Section 5 will introduce a data generating process (DGP) to generate the points on the efficient frontier, then we can identify the MPSS points using Eq. (2).This section presents a compromise solution providing a trade-off between MPSS and demand level. We limit discussion to the production function with multiple inputs and single output. Denote the setMPSSmax={(xM,yM)}as the collection of MPSS points with the peak outputyM=max{y|(x,y)∈MPSSset}. Denote the setYmax={(xP,yP)}as the collection of all of the points with the peak output of the production function, i.e.,yP=max{y|(x,y)∈T˜VRS}. Let Dkbe the forecast demand of firm k and apply the proposed solution to three separate demand cases (Case 1: Dk≤ yM; Case 2: yM< Dk≤ yP; Case 3: Dk> yP).To identify MPSSmax and Ymax, the notations and models are described as follows. LetXikMPSSandYkMPSS(k=1,2,…,K′) be the MPSS points identified by the method of Section 2. MPSSmax can be a set of benchmarks as the convex combinations of the K′ MPSS points. Eq. (3) calculates yMand identifies the set MPSSmax. Strictly MPSSmax is the set of points∑k=1K′λk(XikMPSS,YkMPSS)whereλ1,…,λK′maximize y in Eq. (3).(3)yM=max{y|∑k=1K′λkYkMPSS≥y;∑k=1K′λk=1;λk≥0,∀k∈{1,…,K′};y≥0}Note that there are potentially multiple benchmarks of MPSSmax; however, they do not affect our illustration. In fact, a unique MPSSmax point will be useful because then a compromise target described later can be sought along the line joining two points (i.e., MPSSmax point and demand point). There are two possible approaches to create a unique MPSSmax solution by adding the constraint∑k=1K′λkXikMPSS=xi,∀i∈{1,…,I}. First, a solution that minimizesMy−∑i=1Ixithe objective function of Eq. (3), represents a point in MPSSmax that uses minimal input resource. Second, if the price of input is available, by letting cibe the cost of the input resource i, we can use Eq. (3) to obtain (xM, yM) with the minimum cost input when replacing the objective function of Eq. (3) by maxMy−∑icixi, where M is a large positive number.Regarding estimating Ymax, which can be a set of benchmarks as the convex combinations of all the points. Note that the peak output yPis limited since the PPS is defined by the VRS frontier. Then we calculate yPand identifies Ymax using Eq. (4).(4)yP=max{y|∑k=1KλkYk≥y;∑k=1Kλk=1;λk≥0,∀k∈{1,…,K};y≥0}Similarly, we can obtain a solution with the minimum cost input by replacing the objective function with maxMy−∑icixiand adding the constraint∑k=1KλkXik=xi,∀i∈{1,…,I}.Based on identification of MPSSmax and Ymax, separate the demand scenario into three categories and we can develop different models corresponding to each scenario. These models suggest the compromise targets between MPSS and demand fulfillment. Fig. 3, which shows a one-input and one-output case, illustrates a demand scenario with respect to the three cases.When demand level is less than the output level of MPSSmax, identifying the most-productive-scale-size-and-demand-fulfillment (MPSSDF) benchmark can simultaneously achieve MPSS and demand fulfillment. That is, MPSSDF benchmark is the target on the efficient frontier which is MPSS and fulfills demand completely. Here, Case 1 provides the resource reallocation of inputs and outputs toward MPSSDF. Fig. 4 illustrates the MPSSDF benchmark.Ideally, if the number of MPSS points is large enough and the demand level is not lower than the efficient production, then the firm's MPSSDF target can be identified by following Eq. (5).22In general, a demand hyperplane truncating the MPSS set is not guaranteed to happen because the PPS set may only contain points with every input exceeding a positive bound. That is, Eq. (5) may not have a solution. To address the issue, see Appendix for details.Let the setMPSSDF={(XiMPSSDF,YMPSSDF)}be the collection of MPSSDF targets. Eq. (5) suggests the MPSSDF target toward which firm k can move.(5)min∑i=1Ixi∑k=1K′λkXikMPSS≤xi,∀i∈{1,…,I};∑k=1K′λkYkMPSS=Dk;∑k=1K′λk=1;λk≥0,∀k∈{1,…,K′};xi≥0,∀i∈{1,…,I}Since demand truncates, the MPSS set may generate multiple MPSSDF benchmarks, as shown in Fig. 4. Similarly, we can replace the objective function of Eq. (5) by min∑icixifor obtaining the MPSSDF target with the minimum cost input. Thus, the MPSSDF target is an allocatively efficient benchmark and a MPSS point given demand level.Note that, in practice, the MPSSDF target generated by Eq. (5) may produce an inefficient target due to the MPSS set estimated by a discrete subset of the MPSS points. To address the issue, we can project the inefficient target to its efficient benchmark on the frontier via efficiency measure θVRS. That is, denote the new approximate MPSSDF target by(θVRS*xi*,Dr), whereθVRS*is the optimal solution ofDVRS(xi*,Dr)and(xi*,Dr)is the solution generated by Eq. (5). See Section 5.1 for illustration.If demand level is larger than the output level of MPSSmax and smaller than the output level of Ymax, a firm should set the target with a trade-off between MPSSmax and demand-fulfillment-level-closest-to-MPSSmax (DFcMPSSmax) that is the benchmark of demand fulfillment closest to MPSSmax. In fact, MPSSmax is non-dominated benchmark with respect to MPSS and DFcMPSSmax is non-dominated benchmark with respect to demand fulfillment. Here, the MPSSDF does not exist, and the implication for management is to focus on a trade-off and formulate a MODA problem, i.e. the firm would like to minimize both the distance to MPSSmax and the distance to DFcMPSSmax. Fig. 5illustrates such a trade-off.Here, we first propose a formulation to identify the DFcMPSSmaxDFcMPSSmax={(XiD,YD)}, which is an optimal solution generated from Eq. (6).(6)min∑i=1I(XiM−xi)2+(YM−Dr)2∑k=1KλkXik≤xi,∀i∈{1,…,I};∑k=1KλkYk=Dr;∑k=1Kλk=1;λk≥0,∀k∈{1,…,K};xi≥0,∀i∈1,…,IEq. (6) finds a point on the VRS frontier with outputYD=Drand the point(x1,…,xI,YD)must satisfy all constraints such that each xiis as close as possible to the MPSSmax point. The objective function shows the shortest Euclidean distance to the DFcMPSSmax benchmark. The constraints present the DEA formulation and construct the production function where the efficient benchmark is located. We can ignore the constant term(YM−Dr)2in the objective function of Eq. (6), because it does not affect the optimization result. Thus, we solve the objective function measured by Euclidean distance by quadratic programming.Moreover, if the costs of changing inputs are available, we suggest an alternative method from the cost aspect and the rectilinear distance measure (also called Manhattan distance or city-block distance) (Francis, McGinnis, & White, 1991) is used. In fact, the rectilinear distance can benefit the cost analysis of input variation by measuring the distance without quadratic penalty. The approach replaces the Euclidean distance measure in the objective function by rectilinear distance measure∑i=1I|XiM−xi|. To linearize the nonlinear term of absolute value, let|XiM−xi|=xi++xi−andxi=XiM−xi++xi−, which transform Eq. (6) into Eq. (7) for finding a DFcMPSSmax benchmark, wherexi+andxi−are nonnegative variables used for linearization.(7)min∑i=1I(xi++xi−)∑k=1KλkXik≤XiM−xi++xi−,∀i∈{1,…,I};∑k=1KλkYk=Dr;∑k=1Kλk=1;λk≥0,k∈{1,…,K};xi+,xi−≥0,i∈{1,…,I}In the absence of price information, Eq. (7) only provides a simple benchmark DFcMPSSmax on the efficient frontier without aggregating input factors if they have different units. If the price of changing input is known or available, we can use a weighted rectilinear distance measure∑i=1Ibi|XiM−xi|to calculate the cost of input variation, where biis the cost per unit of changing input resource i. Thus, we can interpret the objective function as the distance from MPSSmax to DFcMPSSmax with a minimal cost of changing input resource (i.e. resource reallocation). Note that we do not use∑i=1Ibi(XIM−xi)2here due to a quadratic penalty.Finally, to address MODA (i.e., minimize the distance to both MPSSmax and DFcMPSSmax simultaneously), transfer two objectives into a single profit function. However, it is difficult to estimate the target directly due to the piecewise-linear frontier generated by DEA. To address the issue and show a trade-off between MPSSmax and DFcMPSSmax, set a point namedConMD=(XiMD,YMD)located on the convex combination of MPSSmax and DFcMPSSmax. Thus, the candidate of target of firm r becomes the projected benchmark on the frontier by passing through ConMD. Fig. 6illustrates the idea.Let w be a trade-off parameter for the convex combination between MPSSmax and DFcMPSSmax, and 0 ≤ w ≤ 1. DefineConMD=(XiMD,YMD)=(wXiM+(1−w)XiD,wYM+(1−w)YD). In a special case, ifw=0, then the ConMD represents DFcMPSSmax, andw=1for MPSSmax. Based on ConMD, we can estimate the candidate of target on the frontier using the direction distance function (DDF) (Chambers et al., 1996). Letθ^be an efficiency measure. Given the direction (XiMD−Xir,YMD−Yr), we formulate DDF as Eq. (8).(8)Maxθ^s.t.∑k=1KλkXik≤Xir+θ^(XiMD−Xir),∀i∈{1,…,I}∑k=1KλkYk≥Yr+θ^(YMD−Yr)∑k=1Kλk=1λk≥0,k∈{1,…,K};θ^≥0Finally, define the candidate of target as(Xir+θ^*(XiMD−Xir),Yr+θ^*(YMD−Yr)), whereθ^*is the optimal solution of decision variableθ^in Eq. (8). To show a trade-off in MODA, try different w values to find the multiple candidates of target. If the input price and output price are available, the proposed model can find the allocatively efficient target by finding the best w such that maximizing the profit functionp[Yr+θ^*(YMD−Yr)]−∑ici[Xir+θ^*(XiMD−Xir)], where p is the output price.In order to find the best trade-off parameter w that generates the target for profit maximization, we suggest the following procedure. To begin, manually generate several w parameters to create a discrete span of candidate of target given stepwise-picked w, then find the profit-maximization benchmark from these discrete candidates. In practice, different w form distinct bins and represent the resolution, namely, the “bin size” with respect to the w parameter assigned helps us to determine the best target. For example, letw=0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,or1with 0.1 interval. The smaller the interval the better target due to a higher resolution. For example, let wψbe the ψth trade-off parameter such that 0 ≤ wψ≤ 1, andθ^ψ*be the optimal solution generated from Eq. (8) given wψ. Mathematically define the approximate optimal trade-off parameter w* for profit-maximized target as Eq. (9).(9)w*=argmaxwψ{p[Yr+θ^ψ*(wψYM+(1−wψ)YD−Yr)]−∑ici[Xir+θ^ψ*(wψXiM+(1−wψ)XiD−Xir)],∀ψ}Note that when MPSSmax and DFcMPSSmax are close to each other, the convex combination of these two benchmarks provides a good approximation to represent the target on the frontier.The solution approach for Case 3 is similar to the model introduced in Case 2. The only difference is that firm r sets the target with a trade-off between MPSSmax and Ymax. We can name the pointConMY=(XiMY,YMY)=(wXiM+(1−w)XiP,wYM+(1−w)YP)located on the convex combination of MPSSmax and Ymax. The candidate of target can be calculated by(Xir+θ^**(XiMY−Xir),Yr+θ^**(YMY−Yr), whereθ^**is an optimal solution generated by a variant of Eq. (8) with replacingConMD=(XiMD,YMD)byConMY=(XiMY,YMY). Fig. 7illustrates the idea.Table 1summarizes the three distinct cases described above.This section proposes three models to aggregate the targets identified from Section 3 in an environment characterized by highly volatile demand. In practice, a discrete set of scenarios will be used to model demand distribution and we propose three models based on decision under uncertainty (i.e. no information about probability distribution). Three models are developed: (1) minimax regret approach (MMR), (2) expected value (EV), and (3) stochastic programming (SP). For the three proposed models described below, each scenario assumes a single level of demand and identifies a target corresponding to it, that is,Targets=(XisT,YsT)is the target obtained from Section 3 given one specific demand scenarios∈{1,…,S}, andATarget=(XiAT,YAT)is the aggregated target under demand uncertainty.The widely used minimax regret approach (MMR) (Savage, 1951) addresses decision under uncertainty by quantifying the regret when a stochastic event occurs after decision-making. This approach is pessimistic or conservative, e.g., a decision-maker wants to avoid the worst case yet ensure a guaranteed minimum possible payoff. In this study the regret refers to the distance from the aggregated target to each target under different demand scenarios. We propose the MMR approach to minimize the maximal distance from aggregated target(XiAT,YAT)to each individual target(XisT,YsT)generated by each corresponding demand scenario, i.e., our MMR model minimizes the maximum regret in terms of all scenarios.To identify(XiAT,YAT)on the VRS frontier, we apply a sign-constrained convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS) approach to estimate the VRS DEA frontier (Kuosmanen & Johnson, 2010; Lee, Johnson, Moreno-Centeno, & Kuosmanen, 2013). Note that a typical DEA formulation does not successfully support finding the benchmark on the frontier because DEA requires a predetermined orientation and our MMR model minimizes the distance (d) in the objective function rather than an efficiency term (θrVRS) in DEA. That is, we need a formulation of production function for distance measure in objective function. Therefore, we employ an alternative DEA model, sign-constrained CNLS. Kuosmanen and Johnson (2010) have demonstrated that the sign-constrained CNLS is equivalent to the additive single-output version of output-oriented DEA. Let αkand βikbe the decision variables of intercept and slope of ith input of firm k with respect to the linear hyperplane, respectively. ɛkis the decision variable representing the inefficiency term. Index h is an alias of index k representing firm. Formulate the sign-constrained CNLS as Eq. (10). The first constraint represents the linear hyperplane, the second constraint imposes concavity using Afriat's inequalities (Afriat, 1972), and the third constraint imposes monotonicity on the underlying unknown production function. The sign constraint ɛk≤ 0 denotes the inefficiency term. Thus, the linear hyperplanes generated by Eq. (10) form a piecewise linear frontier as DEA.(10)min∑kɛk2Yk=αk+∑iβikXik+ɛk,∀k∈{1,…,K};αk+∑iβikXik≤αh+∑iβihXik,∀k,h∈{1,…,K}andk≠h;βik≥0,i={1,…,I},∀k∈{1,…,K};ɛk≤0,∀k∈{1,…,K};Let d be a decision variable estimating distance (i.e., regret). Minimize the maximum distance (our MMR strategy) to each target(XisT,YsT)and find the aggregated target(XiAT,YAT)by solving Eq. (11), whereαk*andβik*are optimal solutions generated from Eq. (10). It is possible to integrate input and output factors by using the similar approach mentioned above, that is, if the input price and output price are available, formulate the first constraintp|YsT−y|+∑ici|XisT−xi|≤dand then measure the distance in dollars. Let zkbe the binary variable of firm k for choosing one linear hyperplane in CNLS.Eq. (11) with objective functionMd−(py−∑icixi)can be formulated and linearized to obtain the unique aggregated target. The first three constraints are used for model linearization. The constraints four to six are used for identifying the linear hyperplane which the aggregated target located at. The remaining constraints are DEA constraints and nonnegativity constraints.(11)minMd−(py−∑icixi)p(ys++ys−)+∑ici(xis++xis−)≤d,∀s∈{1,…,S};xi=XisT−xis++xis−,i={1,…,I},∀s∈{1,…,S};y=YsT−ys++ys−,∀s∈{1,…,S};y≤αk*+∑iβik*xi+M(1−zk),∀k∈{1,…,K};y≥αk*+∑iβik*xi−M(1−zk),∀k∈{1,…,K};∑kzk=1;∑k=1KλkXik≤xi,∀i∈{1,…,I};∑k=1KλkYk≥y;∑k=1Kλk=1;zk∈{0,1},λk≥0,∀k∈{1,…,K};xi,y,xis+,xis−,ys+,ys−≥0,∀i∈{1,…,I},∀s∈{1,…,S}The second proposed model, the EV model, assumes that all demands are equally likely to occur only when there is no knowledge indicating unequal probabilities (i.e. the principle of indifference) (Keynes, 1921), and calculates the expected value of demand scenarios with equal probability. Let Dksbe the demand of scenario s of kth firm. Define the expected value of demand defined asD¯k=1S∑s=1SDks. Now,D¯kis a single level of demand with respect to firm k. Using the case identification described in Section 3, the EV model is to generate the aggregated target with respect to this expected-value scenario.The third proposed model, the SP model, applies stochastic programming (SP) to set the aggregated target(XiAT,YAT)(Birge & Louveaux, 2011; Lee & Johnson, 2014). Let dsbe the decision variable representing the distance (i.e., regret) associated with each scenario s. The SP calculates the expected regret regarding each scenario with equal probability (i.e. the principle of indifference), and then find the aggregated target. Replace the decision variable d by dsassociated with each scenario s and change the objective function asM(1S∑sds)−(py−∑icixi)in Eq. (11).This section describes the experimental setup and a comparison of the three solution approaches addressing uncertainty.Firm-level data motivates this study. We introduce sufficient variation in the data sets to evaluate the solution approaches under different conditions and to study the impact of the problem parameters on capacity decisions. The sets of values for the various parameters in the model are as follows.Production function. We use the DGP for the two inputs and singleoutput Cobb–Douglas production function ensuring decreasing returns to scale, and generate 50 efficient observations on the frontier given byYk=(X1k)0.4(X2k)0.4, where X1kand X2kindependently follow uniform distribution Uniform(1, 10). Note that, as mentioned in footnote 1, due to X1kand X2kfrom Uniform(1, 10) the random selection gives a VRS frontier that excludes the origin.Price of input and outputs. We assume price availability of inputs and outputs for allocatively efficient benchmark and uniqueness. Note that we assume the cost per unit of input and the cost per unit of changing input are the same. Letp=15,c1=b1=6, andc2=b2=4.Inefficient firm k. We assume one inefficient firm k for finding the compromise target and randomly generate it as(X1k,X1k,Yk)=(4.836,6.315,3.638).We randomly generate 50 VRS efficient observations via DGP and find that 7 observations are MPSS points. In particular, the peak output of MPSS set isMPSSmax={(X1M,X2M,YM)}={(2.002,6.107,2.722)}. The peak output of production function isYmax={(X1P,X2P,YP)}={(8.979,8.868,5.760)}. For simplicity, we discuss three demand scenarios generated from normal distribution Normal(Yr, 1) to represent the Case 1 with demand level 2.479, Case 2 with demand level 4.075, and Case 3 with 6.027.For the first demand scenario with lower demand level (i.e. Case 1), we use Eq. (5) to identify the MPSSDF benchmark asMPSSDF={(2.051,4.948,2.479)}withθVRS*=0.978. To set the target on the frontier, we find the approximate MPSSDF as {(2.007,  4.839,  2.479)} by the method described in Section 3.1. Thus, the inefficient firm can drive productivity toward MPSSDF benchmark without a trade-off between MPSS and demand level.For the second demand scenario with larger demand level than the output level of MPSSmax and less than the output level of Ymax (i.e. Case 2), we identify theDFcMPSSmax={(X1D,X2D,YD)}={(4.640,7.226,4.075)}. Given different trade-off parameter w with bin size equal to 0.1, we formulate a convex combination between MPSSmax and DFcMPSSmax, and calculate ConMD shown in Table 2. The target approximate to profit-maximization benchmark is (3.433, 6.834, 3.521) with profit 4.882.For the third demand scenario, with larger demand level than the output level of Ymax (i.e. Case 3), we formulate a convex combination between MPSSmax and Ymax, and calculate ConMY as in Table 3. The target approximate to profit maximization benchmark isMPSSmax={(3.433,6.834,3.521)}with profit 4.393. The result shows that it is not worthwhile to catch the demand level higher than Ymax when too far from MPSS set by considering the effect of diminishing returns of the production function.To test the data variation, we use the second demand scenario as an example for sensitivity analysis. The result of the second scenario illustrates the trade-off between MPSSmax and DFcMPSSmax. We want to investigate the price variations of input factor and output factor. Table 4 summarizes the result of our sensitivity analysis. First, we keep input price constant and change the output price. If p ≥ 16.14, then the target will be DFcMPSSmax; if p ≤ 13.90, then the target will be MPSSmax; otherwise the target with 16.14 < p < 13.90 shows the trade-off between MPSSmax and DFcMPSSmax. This result is intuitive since the higher the output price the more output we would like to generate for sale. Thus, the DFcMPSSmax is a profit-maximization benchmark given condition p ≥ 16.14 while MPSSmax is a profit-maximization benchmark given the lower output price. In addition, given fixed output price, the price of input X1 is more sensitive to the price of input X2. Since a small variation in c1 will lead to a significant change of target, management or the decision-maker should monitor the price variation of X1 and focus effort on the stabilization of c1.Again, we use the three scenarios (i.e. demand forecasts) above and use the three proposed models (i.e., MMR model, EV model and SP model) to calculate the aggregated target under three demand scenarios. In the MMR model, we define regret as the maximum distance from the aggregated target to each individual target corresponding to its demand scenario. MMR shows the aggregated target is(X1AT,X2AT,YAT)=(3.210,5.021,3.021)using model (11). In the EV model, based on the principle of indifference, the expected demandD¯r=4.193corresponds to Case 2. Thus, we calculate theDFcMPSSmax={(X1D,X2D,YD)}={(4.826,7.476,4.193)}, and then the aggregated target is (3.216, 6.858, 3.433). The SP model generates the aggregated target (2.002, 6.107, 2.722) as MPSSmax. The results show that EV provides an aggregated target with a higher output level 3.433 due to diluting the worst case; however, the SP suggests a robust target with a lower output level 2.722 (i.e., MPSSmax) which has the benefit of scale.Table 5 lists the comparison of the three proposed models. To summarize, the MMR model assessing the regret and minimizing the maximal regret leads to the worst case analysis, where the aggregated target is associated with an exceptional demand scenario. Thus, the MMR model is sensitive to the outlier and provides a conservative result. In the EV model, the principle of indifference supports the equal probability of each scenario and the EV model calculates the expected value of demand scenarios as only one dummy scenario. While the method is straightforward, it may smooth out the outlier and eliminate the worst-case effect. It is applicable to a small variation among scenarios. The SP model considers all demand scenarios including the outlier effect. Because it minimizes the expected regret, the SP model provides the most robust solution like MPSSmax to address demand fluctuation. As mentioned, in the long run, the MPSS provides a cost-minimization benchmark addressing uncertainty due to an economic scale size. The result of SP model gives insights to justify that capacity installation should refer to economic scale size to address future uncertainty.
