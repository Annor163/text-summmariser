In this paper, we have proposed a new method of similarity measure associating the geometric distance, area and height of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Some properties regarding the proposed new method of similarity measure have been derived. To illustrate the effectiveness of this method, it is compared with existing techniques taking thirty two different sets of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Moreover, the proposed method has been used for calculating the fuzzy risk analysis in a production system in which different parameters are represented by linguistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In 1984, Schmucker [3] first introduced the fuzzy risk analysis which is very important in real world. To calculate the risk of a system in which different parameters are of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, the different researchers have proposed the different methods at different times. With the concept of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Tang and Chi [13] presented a method for predicting multilateral trade credit risk. Based on alpha level set and the non linear programming solution procedure, Wang and Elhag [15] introduced the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. Using linguistic term, Kangari and Riggs [4] proposed a method of risk assessment in 1989. Lee et al. [16] presented a method to estimate the human health risk from ground water contamination and to evaluate possible uncertainties associated with the elements and their impact on the results. These are represented by a fuzzy set approach and incorporated into the health risk assessment process. To evaluate the risk of ground water contamination with both probability and uncertainties of fuzzy numbers, Li et al. [2] proposed an integrated fuzzy stochastic risk assessment (IFSRA) approach in 2007.Out of these techniques, the similarity measure is very important for analysis of fuzzy risk in a system. Chen [11] introduced a subjectial mental workload assessment and risk analysis. With the help of ‘graded mean integration representation’, Hseih and Chen [1] presented a new similarity measure. For any two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, Chen and Chen [5] introduced a similarity measure with a concept of center of gravity (COG) distance. In 2007, Chen and Chen [10] presented a fuzzy risk based on ranking of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Wei and Chen [6,7] presented a new similarity measure of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to evaluate a fuzzy risk analysis using linguistic term values. Chen and Chen [9] introduced a similarity measure using generalized trapezoidal fuzzy number. In 2010, Xu et al. [17] also introduced a new similarity measure using COG point and a new arithmetic operator for linguistic valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. With the help of area and perimeter, Hejazi et al. [12] also introduced similarity measure between two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.In this paper, we introduce a new similarity measure using geometric distance, area and height of two trapezoidal valued fuzzy numbers. Some properties of the proposed similarity measure have been derived. Taking thirty two different sets of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, it has been shown that the proposed method is better than the existing ones. Finally, the proposed method has been used to analyze the fuzzy risk in a production system. The proposed research paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the limitations of some recent existing methods of similarity measures are discussed. In Section 3, we introduce the preliminaries of fuzzy numbers and their arithmetics. In Section 4, the proposed new method is presented with some properties and in Section 5 we illustrate the comparison with other methods. In Section 6, we calculate the risk of a production system with our new similarity measure technique. In Section 7, the conclusion is presented.In this section, we briefly review some existing literatures involving similarity measure of linguistic valued trapezoidal numbers. For this purpose, we introduce two sets (T1˜,T2˜) and (T1˜,T3˜) of different linguistic valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbersT1˜=(0.3, 0.3, 0.4, 0.4;1.0),T2˜=(0.5, 0.5, 0.8, 0.8;1.0) andT3˜=(0.6, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7;1.0). The geometrical representations of these fuzzy numbers in the sets (T1˜,T2˜) and (T1˜,T3˜) are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) respectively.According to the method of Chen [11], the similarity measure of trapezoidal fuzzy numbersA˜=(a1,a2,a3,a4)andB˜=(b1,b2,b3,b4), denoted byS(A˜,B˜), is defined as(1)S(A˜,B˜)=1−14∑i=14|ai−bi|Now, according to this formula, the similarity measures for the sets (T1˜,T2˜) and (T1˜,T3˜) are given byS(T1˜,T2˜)=1−14(0.2+0.2+0.4+0.4)=0.7S(T1˜,T3˜)=1−14(0.3+0.3+0.3+0.3)=0.7So, the similarities for the sets (T1˜,T2˜) and (T1˜,T3˜) are same, but the graphical representations of these fuzzy numbers show that the similarities between these two couples are not same. Hence, it is a drawback of this method for the above types of fuzzy numbers.In 1999, Hsieh and Chen proposed a similarity measure between trapezoidal fuzzy numbers using “graded mean integration representation distance”. Now for a trapezoidal fuzzy number,A˜=(a1,a2,a3,a4), the graded mean integration representation distance denoted byP(A˜), is defined as(2)P(A˜)=a1+2a2+2a3+a46So, according their approach, the degree of similarity between two linguistic valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbersA˜andB˜is calculated as(3)S(A˜,B˜)=11+d(A˜,B˜)whered(A˜,B˜)=|P(A˜)−P(B˜)|.Now, for the fuzzy numbersT1˜,T2˜andT3˜,P(T1˜)=0.3+0.6+0.8+0.46=0.35P(T2˜)=0.5+1.0+1.6+0.86=0.65P(T3˜)=0.6+1.2+1.4+0.76=0.65Therefore, according to this method, the similarity measures for the sets (T1˜,T2˜) and (T1˜,T3˜) areS(T1˜,T2˜)=11+d(T1˜,T2˜)=0.7692308S(T1˜,T3˜)=11+d(T1˜,T3˜)=0.7692308.Here, the similarities between (T1˜,T2˜) and (T1˜,T3˜) are also same, but the graphical representations of these fuzzy numbers show that the similarities between these two couples are not same. Hence, this method also cannot measure the similarity properly for above fuzzy numbers.Chen and Chen [8] presented a similarity measure between generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers with the concept of COG. In their opinion, the COG(x*A˜,y*A˜)of a generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numberA˜=(a1,a2,a3,a4;wA˜)is given byy*A˜=wA˜×(a3−a2a4−a1+2)6ifa4≠a1and0<wA˜≤1wA˜2ifa4=a1and0<wA˜≤1x*A˜=y*A˜×(a3+a2)+(a4+a1)(wA˜−y*A˜)2wA˜.Then the degree of similarityS(A˜,B˜)between the trapezoidal fuzzy numbersA˜andB˜is given by(4)S(A˜,B˜)=1−14∑i=14|ai−bi|1−|x*A˜−x*B˜|⌈((sA˜+sB˜)/(2))⌉×min(y*A˜,y*B˜)max(y*A˜,y*B˜)wheresA˜= a4−a1 andsB˜= b4−b1.Now, we introduce another couple of fuzzy numbers shown at Fig. 1(c) where two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are given byT4˜=(0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3;0.0) andT5˜= (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5;0.0). Then, by this procedure,y*T4˜=0.0 andy*T5˜= 0.0, so max(y*T4˜,y*T5˜), that is, the denominator of one part in the expression (4) becomes zero. Therefore, it is not possible to find the measure of similarity by this method for such two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Now, this limitation arises due to the cause of zero hight of the fuzzy numbers.Wei and Chen [7] presented a similarity measure between two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers by the formula:(5)S(A˜,B˜)=1−14∑i=14|ai−bi|×min(P(A˜),P(B˜))+min(wA˜,wB˜)max(P(A˜),P(B˜))+max(wA˜,wB˜)whereP(A˜)=(a1−a2)2+wA˜2+(a3−a4)2+wA˜2+(a3−a2)+(a4−a1)andP(B˜)=(b1−b2)2+wB˜2+(b3−b4)2+wB˜2+(b3−b2)+(b4−b1).This method also has a drawback for the previous example given in Fig. 1(c). SinceP(T4˜)andP(T5˜)are both zero, hence the similarity cannot be measured by this method.Xu et al. [17] gave a new method based on COG to calculate the similarity between two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers by the following formula:(6)S(A˜,B˜)=1−18∑i=14|ai−bi|−d(A˜,B˜)2wherey*A˜=wA˜×(a3−a2a4−a1+2)6ifa4≠a1wA˜2ifa4=a1x*A˜=y*A˜×(a3+a2)+(a4+a1)(wA˜−y*A˜)2wA˜ifwA˜≠0a4+a12ifwA˜=0y*B˜=wB˜×(b3−b2b4−b1+2)6ifb4≠b1wB˜2ifb4=b1x*B˜=y*B˜×(b3+b2)+(b4+b1)(wB˜−y*B˜)2wB˜ifwB˜≠0b4+b12ifwB˜=0andd(A˜,B˜)=(x*A˜−x*B˜)2+(y*A˜−y*B˜)21.25.Now, if the similarities of the fuzzy numbers in Fig. 1(a) and (b) i.e,S(T1˜,T2˜)andS(T1˜,T3˜)are measured, we get the following results:y*T1˜=0.5,x*T1˜=0.35y*T2˜=0.5,x*T2˜=0.65y*T3˜=0.5,x*T3˜=0.65d(T1˜,T2˜)=0.2683andd(T1˜,T3˜)=0.2683.Then,S(T1˜,T2˜)=0.7166andS(T1˜,T2˜)=0.7166.Now, it is observed thatS(T1˜,T2˜)=S(T1˜,T3˜)by this technique. But from the geometrical figures, these are not same. So, this is a drawback of this method for the above examples.Again in 2011, Hejazi et al. [12] also formulated a similarity measure between two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers as follows:S(A˜,B˜)=1−14∑i=14|ai−bi|×min(P(A˜),P(B˜))max(P(A˜),P(B˜))×min(A(A˜),A(B˜))+min(wA˜,wB˜)max(A(A˜),A(B˜))+max(wA˜,wB˜)whereP(A˜)=(a1−a2)2+wA˜2+(a3−a4)2+wA˜2+(a3−a2)+(a4−a1),P(B˜)=(b1−b2)2+wB˜2+(b3−b4)2+wB˜2+(b3−b2)+(b4−b1),A(A˜)=wA˜×(a4+a3−a2−a1)2andA(B˜)=wB˜×(b4+b3−b2−b1)2.Now, if heights of two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are equal to zero, then areas of two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers also become zero. Therefore, the maximum area and maximum height are also zeros. So, in such types of fuzzy numbers, the similarity measures cannot be evaluated by this method.In this section, we briefly review the basic concept of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. For a generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numberA˜=(a,b,c,d;w)where a, b, c, d andware real numbers in such a way that a≤b≤c≤d,0≤w≤1, as shown in Fig. 2, the membership function ofA˜is given byμA˜(x)=0,if−∝<x≤ax−ab−a,ifa<x≤bw,ifb<x≤cd−xd−c,ifc<x≤d0,ifd<x<∝We also review some basic operations of two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Assume that there are two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbersA˜=(a1,b1,c1,d1;w1)andB˜=(a2,b2,c2,d2;w2)where 0≤a1≤b1≤c1≤d1≤1 and 0≤a2≤b2≤c2≤d2≤1, then by Xu et al. [17], some arithmetic operations betweenA˜andB˜are defined as follows:The additional operator denoted by ⊕, the multiplication operator denoted by ⊗ and the divisional operator denoted by ø of the generalized fuzzy numbersA˜andB˜are defined asA˜⊕B˜=(a1,b1,c1,d1;w1)⊕(a2,b2,c2,d2;w2)=(a1+a2−a1a2,b1+b2−b1b2,c1+c2−c1c2,d1+d2−d1d2;min(w1,w2))A˜⊗B˜=(a1,b1,c1,d1;w1)⊗(a2,b2,c2,d2;w2)=(a1a2,b1b2,c1c2,d1d2;min(w1,w2))A˜øB˜=(a1,b1,c1,d1;w1)ø(a2,b2,c2,d2;w2)=(a1/d2,b1/c2,c1/b2,d1/a2;min(w1,w2))wherea/b=ab,ifa<b1,otherwiseTo overcome the anomalies of similarity measure discussed in Section 2, a new method to calculate the degree of similarity between two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is presented here. Our proposed method combines the concept of (i) geometric distance, (ii) area and (iii) height of a generalized trapezoidal fuzzy number.Definition: IfT˜=(t1,t2,t3,t4;w)is a generalized trapezoidal fuzzy number, then the area of this fuzzy number, denoted byar(T˜), is defined by(7)ar(T˜)=(t4+t3−t2−t1)×w2IfT1˜=(t11,t12,t13,t14;wT1˜)andT2˜=(t21,t22,t23,t24;wT2˜)be two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, then the degree of similarity between these two fuzzy numbers, denoted byS(T1˜,T2˜), is defined as(8)S(T1˜,T2˜)=1−14∑i=14|t1i−t2i|×1−12{|ar(T1˜)−ar(T2˜)|+|wT1˜−wT2˜|}The larger value ofS(T˜1,T˜2)gives the more similarity between the generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.Now, some properties of this new proposed similarity measure are deduced as follows:Property 1S(T1˜,T2˜)=1if and only if two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbersT˜1andT2˜are identical.ProofIfS(T1˜,T2˜)=1, then by definition1−14∑i=14|t1i−t2i|×1−12{|ar(T1˜)−ar(T2˜)|+|wT1˜−wT2˜|}=1Therefore, this implies that∑i=14|t1i−t2i|=0and|ar(T1˜)−ar(T2˜)|+|wT1˜−wT2˜|=0.That is, t11=t21, t12=t22, t13=t23, t14=t24,ar(T1˜)=ar(T2˜)andwT1˜=wT2˜.Conversely, ifT1˜andT2˜are identical, then t11=t21, t12=t22, t13=t23, t14=t24 andwT1˜=wT2˜. Thus ar(T1˜)=ar(T2˜). Therefore, the degree of similarity betweenT1˜andT2˜is calculated as follows:S(T1˜,T2˜)=1−14∑i=14|t1i−t2i|×1−12{|ar(T1˜)−ar(T2˜)|+|wT1˜−wT2˜|}=(1−0)×(1−0)=1ThereforeS(T1˜,T2˜)=1if and only if two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbersT˜1andT2˜are identical.□Property 2S(T1˜,T2˜)=S(T2˜,T1˜)ProofWe know that,S(T1˜,T2˜)=1−14∑i=14|t1i−t2i|×1−12{|ar(T1˜)−ar(T2˜)|+|wT1˜−wT2˜|}S(T2˜,T1˜)=1−14∑i=14|t2i−t1i|×1−12{|ar(T2˜)−ar(T1˜)|+|wT2˜−wT1˜|}Since,∑i=14|t1i−t2i|=∑i=14|t2i−t1i|,|ar(T1˜)−ar(T2˜)|=|ar(T2˜)−ar(T1˜)|and also|wT1˜−wT2˜|=|wT2˜−wT1˜|, hence,S(T1˜,T2˜)=S(T2˜,T1˜). □Property 3With same shape, same scale and same offset (d) for two generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbersT1˜andT2˜,S(T1˜,T2˜)=1−|d|.ProofSince, the offsets of two trapezoidal fuzzy numbersT1˜andT2˜are same, hence d=t21−t11=t22−t12=t23−t13=t24−t14. AgainwT1˜=wT2˜because the fuzzy numbers are of same scale. Also, they are of same shape, soar(T1˜)=ar(T2˜). Then by our proposed definition, the similarity betweenT1˜andT2˜is calculated asS(T1˜,T2˜)=1−14∑i=14|t1i−t2i|×1−12{|ar(T1˜)−ar(T2˜)|+|wT1˜−wT2˜|}=1−14∑i=14|d+d+d+d|×1−12(0+0)=1−|d|.□Property 4S(T1˜,T2˜)=0ifT1˜=(0,0,0,0;0)andT2˜=(1,1,1,1;1).ProofIfT1˜=(0,0,0,0;0)andT2˜=(1,1,1,1;1), then14∑i=14|t1i−t2i|=(4/4)=1,ar(T1˜)=0,ar(T2˜)=0,wT1˜=0andwT2˜=1.Hence, by our definition, the similarity measure betweenT1˜andT2˜can be obtained asS(T1˜,T2˜)=1−14∑i=14|t1i−t2i|×1−12{|ar(T1˜)−ar(T2˜)|+|wT1˜−wT2˜|}=(1−1){1−(1/2)}=0.□In this section, we introduce thirty two different sets of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers given in Fig. 3and for these sets, it is shown that our proposed method gives the best performance out of existing methods of similarity measure (Chen [11], Hsieh and Chen [1], Chen and Chen [8], Wei and Chen [7], Xu et al. [17], Hejazi et al. [12]). The detailed results by all existing and our proposed methods for these thirty two sets are shown in Table 2. Now, we discuss set wise different anomalies of existing methods.(1) According to the method of Chen [11], the similarity measures for the sets (10, 15, 17, 20 and 29) are equal to 1 which means that two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in these sets are equal, but from the geometrical representations for these sets it is clear that the similarity measures will not be equal to 1. Table 2 shows that our proposed method gives the different similarity measures which are admissible with its geometrical representations. Also, for the sets (2 and 8), the similarity measures are same (0.6) though their geometrical representations of fuzzy numbers are different. The same drawback also arises for the sets (11, 13 and 14), (18 and 19) and (31 and 32). But, in our method these drawbacks are overcome.(2) In 1999, Hsieh and Chen [1] introduced another method for calculating the similarity measure of two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. By this technique, the similarity measure is 1 for the sets (1, 4, 7, 10, 15, 17, 20 and 29). But the figures for these sets indicate that it is not correct. Also, the sets (13 and 14) give the same similarity which is not actually possible as heights of two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in these sets are different though they are in same position. But in this case, our proposed method gives different similarities. Therefore, our method is better than the method by Hsieh and Chen.(3) By the method of Chen and Chen [8], the similarity measure cannot be calculated for the sets (6,7,11,14–16,19,20,22–26 and 28–30). For these sets, this method does not work when the height of any one of two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers becomes zero. But using our proposed method, it is possible to calculate the similarities for these sets and the computed values of similarity measure are equitable with the corresponding geometrical representations.(4) The method of Wei and Chen [7] also failed to calculate the degree of similarity for the sets (26 and 28). But calculation of the degree of similarity for these sets is possible properly by our method. Again, we see that for the set 29, the degree of similarity is equal to 0 by the method of Wei and Chen, but the figure shows that two corresponding trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are approximately equal, that is, the similarity of these fuzzy numbers is nearly equal to 1 which proves the betterment of our method, since the similarity measure for this set by our method is equal to 0.995.(5) According to the method of Xu et al. [17], the result of similarity measure for the sets (31 and 32) are same but its geometrical figures imply that it is not correct whereas our proposed method gives different values of similarity for these two sets. Again, if we take two trapezoidal valued fuzzy numbers such thatA˜=(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4;1.0)andB˜=(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4;w), then we compute the similarities by this method and our proposed method and compare the results in the following Table 1with different values ofw.From Table 1, it is seen that whenw=0.1, the similarity measure by Xu et al. is 0.8435 which is more higher than its actual similarity. Hence, the above table shows that the values of similarity are more higher than the differences of heights of two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, that is, the values of similarity are more though the similarities of the geometrical figures of two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are less. Therefore, this measurement is not truly correct. Again, this table shows that our proposed method gives better result which also coincides with the geometrical configuration.(6) Table 2shows that the similarity measures cannot be calculated for the sets (16,24–26 and 28) by the method of Hejazi et al. [12]. Analyzing these sets, it is concluded that if heights of two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers become zero, then the similarity cannot be evaluated by this technique. On the other hand, this drawback is overcome very easily by our method. Again, from geometrical figures for the sets (17,20 and 29), it is seen that they are approximately equal, that is, their similarities will be approximately equal to 1 but by the method of Hejazi et al. [12] these are equal to 0 which is not correct. But our method gives these results approximately equal to 1.Therefore from these discussions, it is concluded that our proposed method for similarity measure gives better results than other existing techniques.At first, Schmucker proposed the fuzzy risk analysis in 1984. Here, a system S consists of a component C which is also built-up by another n sub-components Ci, i=1, 2, …, n. Now, the total riskR˜of the system S depends on the values of (i) “probability of failureRi˜” and (ii) “severity of lossWi˜” for each component Ci, i=1, 2, …, n. Following Schmucker, the structure of a fuzzy risk analysis is shown in Fig. 4. In 1986, Zhang [14] evaluated the values ofRi˜andWi˜in linguistic terms and each linguistic term has been represented by a trapezoidal fuzzy number. Then the fuzzy risk analysis can be done by the following algorithm:Step 1: Consider the “probability of failureRi˜” and “severity of lossWi˜” for each sub-component Ci, i=1, 2, …, n, in linguistic terms such as low, medium, high, etc where n is the number of sub-components of the system.Step 2: Then consider a set of linguistic terms and its corresponding generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.Step 3: Compute total riskR˜of the component C integratingRi˜andWi˜of each sub-component Ciby fuzzy weighted mean method with the help of arithmetic operators of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers as(9)R˜=∑i=1nWi˜⊗Ri˜∑i=1nWi˜whereR˜is also another generalized trapezoidal fuzzy number.Step 4: Then measure the similarities of total riskR˜with all given linguistic terms in Step 2 using our proposed similarity measure technique.Step 5: Then find the largest similarity ofR˜found in Step 4 and it is considered as a risk value of the system in linguistic term.Now in this paper, we have used the proposed similarity measure technique for handling the risk analysis in a production system where the linguistic terms corresponding toR˜iandW˜iare given in Table 4. To illustrate the fuzzy risk analysis in a production system, we consider the following problem.Problem: A manufacturer wants to produce some products for which m number of machines are required. To produce the better quality product, the quality of machines also should be better. Now in the production system, the machines, which are used, may or may not meet the required quality. Hence, there exists a probability of failure of the machines to fulfill the required quality to be about p1 and due to failure of machines there will be a severity of loss to be about p2. Again, for m machines at least m number of expert labors are necessary for a good quality production. But an expert labor may not be always available, so it may hamper the production work. If the probability of non-availability of an expert labor be about p3, then it causes the severity of loss with probability to be about p4. In any production system, the raw materials are also very vital to continue the production. Now, if the probability of non-availability of the raw materials be about p5, there will be a severity of loss for the production to be about p6. A financial support is very essential to continue the process of a production. Now, if the probability of failure for continuing the financial support be about p7, then there occurs a severity of loss with probability to be about p8. Again, a sufficient area is also another essential criteria to store the raw materials as well as the produced items. But at any time during the production, either supplied raw materials or finished products may be more than the capacity of the storage system. So in any production system, there always exists a probability of failure to storage the items which is to be about p9 and for doing so, the severity of loss be about p10. As the probabilistic values p1, p2, … and p10 are not precise due to its nature, so these are all fuzzy numbers. But in a real world, such types of values are more used in linguistic form i.e, in the form of small, medium, high etc. So under these circumstances, what will be the risk of failure for good quality product in linguistic form. As a case study, a manufacturer of a biscuit company, who has 4 number of machines, has been considered in a rural area. As the production area is in a rural area, hence better quality of machines are not available there. Now, if the manufacturer wants to reduce the transportation cost, then he has to buy machines from an unrecognized shop of that local area. Hence, there will be a “fairly high” probability of failure of the machines. If the machines are failed to work, then there will be “high” probability for severity of loss. Again for 4 machines, at least 4 number of expert labors are required for good quality production. But in a rural area, the probability of non-availability of expert labor is “fairly low”. Now, an expert labor is very much essential for any production. But it can be continued with some inexpert labors which could have a risk. So, there is a “medium” probability in severity of loss. Again for this manufacturer, raw materials will be supplied from its neighboring area. So for this manufacturer, probability of non-availability of the raw materials is “absolutely low” for which the severity of loss for the production is “very low”. According to the manufacturer view, he has not much money in his hand. Hence, there will be a “very high” probability of failure to supply the money in the production system. Now-a-days various types of financial support can be available. Therefore, there will be “low” probability in severity of loss. There are not too much storage area in this production factory. So, there will be “absolutely high” probability of failure to storage and there is “medium” probability of severity of loss in the production system. As all probabilistic values are in linguistic term, hence it may be expressed in trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In these circumstances, how much risk exists in the system for its failure to produce good quality of product in linguistic term?To get the answer of this question, the sub-components of the above production system have been considered as follows:(i) the availability of expert labor (C1), (ii) the supply of raw materials (C2), (iii) the financial support (C3), (iv) the working power of the machines (C4),(v)the storage system (C5).The linguistic values of “probability of failure(Ri˜)” and “severity of loss(Wi˜)” for each sub-component Ciare given in Table 4.Now with the help of proposed algorithm mentioned above, the probability of failureR˜of this system is computed by Eq. 9 using Tables 3 and 4as follows:R˜=[fairlylow⊗medium⊕absolutelylow⊗verylow⊕veryhigh⊗low⊕fairlyhigh⊗high⊕absolutelyhigh⊗medium]ø[medium⊕verylow⊕low⊕high⊕medium]=[(0.17,0.22,0.36,0.42;1.0)⊗(0.32,0.41,0.58,0.65;1.0)⊕(0,0,0,0;1.0)⊗(0,0,0.02,0.07;1.0)⊕(0.93,0.98,1.0,1.0,1.0)⊗(0.04,0.1,0.18,0.23;1.0)⊕(0.58,0.63,0.80,0.86;1.0)⊗(0.72,0.78,0.92,0.97;1.0)⊕(1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0;1.0)⊗(0.32,0.41,0.58,0.65;1.0)]ø[(0.32,0.41,0.58,0.65;1.0)⊕(0,0,0.02,0.07;1.0)⊕(0.04,0.1,0.18,0.23;1.0)⊕(0.72,0.78,0.92,0.97;1.0)⊕(0.32,0.41,0.58,0.65;1.0)]=[(0.0544,0.0902,0.2088,0.273;1.0)⊕(0,0,0,0;1.0)⊕(0.0372,0.098,0.18,0.23;1.0)⊕(0.4176,0.4914,0.736,0.8342;1.0)⊕(0.32,0.41,0.58,0.65;1.0)]ø[(0.32,0.41,0.58,0.65;1.0)⊕(0,0,0.02,0.07;1.0)⊕(0.04,0.1,0.18,0.23;1.0)⊕(0.72,0.78,0.92,0.97;1.0)⊕(0.32,0.41,0.58,0.65;1.0)]=(0.6395,0.7537,0.9280,0.9675;1.0)ø(0.8757,0.9532,0.9887,0.9976;1.0)=(0.6410,0.7623,0.9735,1.0;1.0)which is also another trapezoidal fuzzy number. Now, the area of this trapezoidal fuzzy numberR˜is given byar(R˜)=12(d+c−b−a)×w=1+0.9735−0.6410−0.76232=0.285.Hence according to our proposed similarity measure technique, the degree of similarity betweenR˜and each linguistic term i.e., linguistic valued trapezoidal fuzzy number is shown in Table 5.From this table, it is observed that the degree of similarity is maximum forR˜and the linguistic term “high”. Therefore, for this system the risk of failure to produce good quality of product is “high”.
