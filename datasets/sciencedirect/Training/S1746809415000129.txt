@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The measurements of bio-signals are always subject to interference from noise, which would be able to affect the research results. In the present study, we introduce a technique to detect the signal quality by using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and Monte Carlo verification. We first decompose the original signals into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and calculate the average distances between the signal IMFs and the negative (−1) slope line in Monte Carlo verification. Then, the approximate amount of white noise percent level in original signal could be obtained via corresponding to the created curve of distance and noise percent. This new proposed technique makes the approximate white noise percent level could be obtained much easier via a simple distance index through the EEMD and Monte Carlo verification methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Measurements of physiological signals are always subject to interference from noise, which might affect the research result. Also, in the natural systems, physiological signals are non-linear and non-stationary. Some linear and stationary assumptions might probably be inaccurate. In 1998, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was proposed by Huang et al. [1] as an adaptive time–frequency data analysis algorithm that could be applied in both non-linear and non-stationary signals. EMD could decompose the signal to different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from the highest to the lowest frequency in time domain. This algorithm was widely applied in many research areas such as oceans, atmosphere, earthquake analyses, etc. Briefly, the steps of EMD algorithm included as follows. Firstly, it obtains the local maxima and minima as upper and lower envelopes by cubic spline. Also, the mean envelope could be obtained in this step. Then, it decomposes the signal via calculating the difference between the original signal and the mean envelope. The result is the first IMF. Finally, the decomposed signal would be treated as the input data. Then repeat the steps and decompose the signal until the signal becomes a monotonic function. The equation of EMD could be expressed as follows:(1)xt=∑i=1nCit+Rnt,where x(t) is the original recorded signal data in time domain, Ci(t) is the ith IMF, and Rn(t) is the residue.Therefore, we could reconstruct the signal by choosing appropriate IMFs to filter the noises in the signal [2–6]. However, one of the major drawbacks of EMD algorithm is the mode-mixing problem, which is defined as a signal IMF consists either of signals on widely disparate scales, or a signal of a similar scale located in different IMF components [2]. To overcome the mode-mixing problem, Huang et al. [2], in 2009, proposed another noise-assisted algorithm named ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). The steps of EEMD included:Step (1) Create a white noise background which would populate the whole time–frequency space and add the original signal into the white noise.Step (2) Decompose the signal into IMFs.Step (3) Repeat these two steps. In the end, the means of corresponding IMFs of the decompositions could be obtained as the final result [2,3].When the signal is added to the uniform white noise background, the bits of the signal would project onto the appropriate scale [3,4]. The purpose of creating a white noise background and adding it into the signal is to make the values of EMD upper and lower envelopes more easily obtained and further improve the mode-mixing problem.Based on the numerical experiments in the previous study [7], Monte Carlo verification could be applied in determining the relationships within signal IMFs. For example, Fig. 1shows the Monte Carlo verification of decomposition for an ECG signal with 10% standard deviation (SD) white noise added [7]. The groups of dots from the upper left to the lower right indicate the energy density as a function of the averaged period for white noise IMFs [3,4,7–9]. The significant asterisks with numbers on the top are the signal IMFs of the ECG signal with 10% white noise.For white noise, the slope between energy density and averaged period is equal to −1. In other words, if the slope of IMF of the original signals is more closely approach −1, it means there are more noise and less signal information within this IMF [3,4,7–9]. The distance between the line and the IMF components would decrease along with an increasing percentage of white noise. In the present study, we introduce a new approach to detect the signal quality based on using EEMD and Monte Carlo verification to calculate this distance corresponding to the approximate amount of white noise percent in the original signal.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Despite the fact that in EEG signal the averaged distances still decrease along with the increasing percentile, the white noise percent level of the EEG signal is still too hard to detect. We may say that this approach could only be applied in a narrow band signal (e.g., ECG, Photoplethysmogram (PPG), or respiration rate) rather than a broadband signal (e.g., EEG signal). To conclude, our study demonstrates that this new technique is available to detect the signal quality of white noise level in ECG signals. This approach makes the approximate amount of the complicated white noise percent level in the original signal could be realized much easier via a simple distance index calculated through the EEMD and Monte Carlo verification methods.
