We provide explicit representations of three moving planes that form a μ-basis for a standard Dupin cyclide. We also show how to compute μ-bases for Dupin cyclides in general position and orientation from their implicit equations. In addition, we describe the role of moving planes and moving spheres in bridging between the implicit and rational parametric representations of these cyclides.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cyclides, originally introduced by Dupin (1822) hence since called ‘Dupin cyclides’, have been under intensive research for almost two centuries in both classical differential geometry and algebraic geometry (Maxwell, 1868; Casey, 1871; Cayley, 1873). Dupin cyclides are simultaneously enveloped by two families of spheres; each sphere from any of the two families envelopes the cyclide along a circle; and these two families of circles are orthogonal and form the curvature lines of the cyclide. Dupin cyclides are algebraic surfaces of degree up to four, and also admit a biquadratic rational parametrization. Special cases of Dupin cyclides include tori, spheres, cylinders and cones. Dupin cyclides of degree four have the isotropic circle at infinity as their double curve, and thus were subsequently extended to a wider class of quartic surfaces having the circle at infinity as a double curve by Casey (1871) and Darboux (Maxwell, 1868). These extensions are called ‘generalized cyclides’. In the present paper our cyclides will always refer to Dupin cyclides unless otherwise specified.Cyclides were rediscovered by the CAGD community for geometric modeling, due to their advantages in: 1) having low algebraic degree; 2) possessing trigonometric parametrizations and low degree rational parametrizations; 3) containing two families of orthogonal circles as main curvature lines; 4) being closed under offset; 5) being characterized by four constants that have clear geometric meaning (Pratt, 1990, 1995; Johnstone, 1993; Foufou et al., 2005). Cyclides are frequently used as blending surfaces as well as in boundary representations in solid modeling (Pratt, 1990, 1995), and have recently shown their power in architecture geometry (Pottmann et al., 2012; Bo et al., 2011).The technique of moving curves and moving surfaces was first introduced to CAGD by Sederberg and Chen (1995) for fast implicitization of rational curves and rational surfaces. Compared with traditional elimination methods using Gröbner bases or resultant computations, the method of moving curves and moving surfaces is much more efficient, produces no extraneous factors and also works well in the presence of base points. The simplest representatives for moving curves and moving surfaces are moving lines and moving planes. Moving lines are used for the study of rational planar curves, while moving planes are for rational space curves and rational surfaces.A moving line is a family of linesL(t;x,y)=0with each parameter t corresponding to a line. A moving lineL(t;x,y)=0is said to follow a rational planar curveP(t)=(a(t),b(t),c(t))in homogeneous form, if for each parameter valuet0, the lineL(t0;x,y)=0in the family always passes through the corresponding pointP(t0)on the curve, which is equivalent toL(t;a(t)/c(t),b(t)/c(t))≡0. All the moving lines that follow a rational planar curve form a module, called the moving line module of the curve. The analogue of the moving line module is the moving plane module for rational space curves in arbitrary dimensions and for rational surfaces.The moving line module and moving plane module are also called syzygy module. The syzygy module of a rational curve in an arbitrary dimension n is a free module of rank n. A μ-basis for a rational curve is a basis of lowest degree for the syzygy module. However, the syzygy module of a rational surface is free only in affine settings, that is, the parametrization of the surface as well as the moving planes are characterized by polynomials in affine parameters. The homogenized syzygy module of a rational surface is generally not free, in contrast to the homogenized syzygy module of a rational curve which is always free. Hence different definitions of μ-bases for rational surfaces have been proposed; see Cox et al. (1998), Chen et al. (2005). In this paper, we adopt the definition of μ-bases for rational surfaces in Chen et al. (2005), that is, a μ-basis for a rational surface is an arbitrary basis for the dehomogenized syzygy module of the surface.μ-bases inherit all the geometric and algebraic intrinsic properties of rational curves and surfaces, so μ-bases provide a bridge between the parametric and implicit representations. Once μ-bases are available, the problems of implicitization, singularity computation, inversion formula computation can all be solved symbolically and efficiently. After a long period of investigation, the theory of μ-bases for rational curves, including algorithms for computing μ-bases and applications to practical problems, is relatively complete compared with that for rational surfaces. Please refer to Chen and Wang (2003a) and Song and Goldman (2012) for algorithms and properties of μ-bases for rational planar curves and rational space curves in arbitrary dimensions. About applications of μ-bases, please see Chen and Sederberg (2002), Chen et al. (2008), Jia and Goldman (2009, 2012) for singularity computations of rational planar curves, Wang et al. (2009), Shi et al. (2012a) for singularity computations of rational space curves, and Jia et al. (2010) for the implicitization problem of rational space curves. For surfaces, Chen et al. (2005) have proved that a μ-basis for a rational surface under affine settings always exists. Nevertheless, a pervasive algorithm of μ-bases for rational surfaces is still lacking. Exploration on μ-bases theory and applications for some very special surfaces has been made, such as rational ruled surfaces (Chen et al., 2001; Chen and Wang, 2003b; Chen, 2003; Jia et al., 2009), some low degree parametric surfaces (Chen et al., 2007), surfaces of revolution (Shi and Goldman, 2012) as well as surfaces with a pair of orthogonal directrices (Shi et al., 2012b).The goal of this paper is to explore the role of moving planes and moving spheres played in Dupin Cyclides. We provide explicit representations, rather than an algorithm, of μ-bases for standard cyclides (i.e., cyclides in standard position and orientation). Moreover, given the implicit equation of an arbitrary cyclide, we show how to extract the center position, orientation, as well as the four characteristic values of the cyclide; and then write down a μ-basis for the cyclide from a μ-basis for the corresponding standard cyclide. Two reasons for this slight difference from most of the previous literature on μ-bases that start from a rational parametrization of the surface: 1) in practice such as surface blending or modeling, a cyclide is usually characterized by its center position, orientation and the four constant characteristic values that have explicit geometric meanings. We show a direct μ-basis for the cyclide when this information is readily available. 2) Even if this information is hidden for a cyclide that is not in standard position and orientation, this information can be retrieved more easily from the implicit equation than from a rational parametrization. Besides, we reveal the role of moving planes and moving spheres in connecting the rational parametric equation and implicit equation of a cyclide, and show an easy inversion formula for getting the parameters for points on the cyclide via μ-bases.The paper is organized as follows. We first present in Section 2 and Section 3 some basics on Dupin cyclides and μ-bases. Then in Section 4 we derive three moving planes that follow the parametrization of the cyclide, from which in Section 5 we obtain the explicit representations of μ-bases for standard cyclides, and show the role of μ-bases in connecting the parametric and implicit equations. In Section 6 we explain how to extract the center position, orientation as well as the four characteristic values from the implicit equation of a cyclide in general position and orientation, and show how to compute their μ-bases from that for a standard cyclide. We show an example to illustrate the whole process in Section 7. An easy application of μ-basis for inversion formulas is shown in Section 8 and conclusions are drawn in Section 9.A cyclide is a surface whose lines of curvatures are all circles. A cyclide is the envelope of a moving sphere whose center varies along a conic curve and has a quadratic radius function. Readers are referred to Chandru et al. (1989) for all the equivalent definitions for cyclides. Forsyth (1912) develops the implicit equation of a cyclide in standard position and orientation:(1)F(x,y,z)=(x2+y2+z2−f2+b2)2−4(ax−cf)2−4b2y2=0,wherea,b>0,c,f⩾0are constants anda2=b2+c2. We call the cyclide with implicit equation (1) a standard cyclide. Standard cyclides are centered at the origin and have two planes of symmetryy=0andz=0. The cross-section of a cyclide by either of its two symmetric planes is a pair of circles. A cyclide in general position and orientation can be transformed to a standard cyclide via Euclidean transformations.The four constantsa,b,c,funiquely determine a standard cyclide. We call these constants the characteristic values of the cyclide. Cyclides divide into three general subcases by their characteristic values. The cyclide is called a ring cyclide iff<c<a; a spindle cyclide ifa⩽c; and a horn cyclide if0⩽c⩽f. See Fig. 1for illustrations. Note that when settinga=b=R,c=0andf=r, (1) is the implicit equation of a standard torus with major radius R and minor radius r.The most commonly used parametric form of the standard cyclide (1) is:(2){x(θ,ϕ)=f(c−acosθcosϕ)+b2cosθa−ccosθcosϕ,y(θ,ϕ)=bsinθ(a−fcosϕ)a−ccosθcosϕz(θ,ϕ)=bsinθ(ccosθ−f)a−ccosθcosϕ,where0⩽θ,ϕ⩽2π. The trigonometric functions in (2) are rational functions, hence cyclides have rational parametrizations. We next explore from another perspective for a rational bi-quadratic parametrization of cyclides.A cyclide is the envelope of a moving sphereF1that touches three given spheres in generic position. If we pick three arbitrary spheres fromF1, they also define a second moving sphereF2touching these three spheres. The envelope ofF2is the same cyclide. The centers of these two families of spheresF1andF2lie in a pair of two conics, called focal conics of the cyclide. Please refer to Dupin (1822), Cayley (1873), Forsyth (1912), Degen (2002) for these facts and see Fig. 2for the conic pair.F1andF2are called the two families of curvature spheres, which touch each other at a point on the cyclide. With one sphere fixed and the other sphere moving through its family, the contact point of the two spheres generates the corresponding curvature line. We summarize the basic properties of cyclides below.1.Both families of curvature spheresF1andF2envelope the cyclide;The two conicsC1andC2pass through each other's foci;The planes that contain the conicsC1andC2are two planes of symmetry of the cyclide;All the curvature lines are circles, belonging to two families of axial planes.There exist three different options for the conic pairC1andC2, which also classify cyclides into three categories. Degen (2002) provides the parametric representationsh1(s):R↦R3andh2(t):R↦R3for these two conics as well as the radius functionsr1(s),r2(t)of the moving spheresF1andF2:Lemma 2.1(SeeDegen, 2002.) There are three main types of cyclides classified by different conic pairsC1andC2:1.Tori:C1is a circle,C2is a line.(3)h1(s)=R(1−s21+s2,2s1+s2,0),r1(s)=r;h2(t)=R(0,0,2t1−t2),r2(t)=r−R1+t21−t2,where r and R are constants.General cyclides:C1is an ellipse,C2is a hyperbola.(4)h1(s)=(1−s21+s2a,2s1+s2b,0),r1(s)=f−1−s21+s2c;h2(t)=(1+t21−t2c,0,2t1−t2b),r2(t)=f−1+t21−t2a,Note that(4)agrees with(3)when settinga=b=R,c=0andf=r.Parabolic cyclides:C1andC2are both parabolas.(5)h1(s)=c(s2−12,2s,0),r1(s)=f+(s2+12)c;h2(t)=c(12−t2,0,2t),r2(t)=f−(t2+12)c.Note that the constantsa,b,c,fin Eq. (4) are exactly those characteristic values of the cyclides. Since the two families of spheres always touch each other at a point on the cyclide corresponding to the parameter(s,t), we haveLemma 2.2(SeeDegen, 2002.) A rational parametrizationPˆ:R2↦R3of bidegree(2,2)of the cyclide can be given by(6)Pˆ(s,t)=r2(t)h1(s)−r1(s)h2(t)r2(t)−r1(s),whereh1(s),h2(t),r1(s),r2(t)are given by Eqs.(3),(4)and(5)for the three types of cyclides.Remark 2.3When checking that (6) is the parametric form for the implicit surface (1), one should take the geometric restrictiona2=b2+c2into account.From now on, we denote by X the set of variablesx,y,z, and X the four-dimensional vector(x,y,z,1).LetR[s,t]be the polynomial ring over the field of real numbers andR[s,t]mdenote the set of m-dimensional vectors with entries inR[s,t]. Let M be a submodule ofR[s,t]m. A set of elementsfi∈M,i=1,…,kis called a generating set of M, if for anym∈Mthere exist polynomialshi∈R[s,t],i=1,…,ksuch that(7)m=h1f1+⋯+hkfk.The Hilbert Basis Theorem (Cox et al., 2000) guarantees that any submodule M ofR[s,t]mhas a finite generating set. If for anym∈Mthe expression (7) is unique, then the set{fi}i=1kis called a basis of the module M. A module M is called a free module if M has a basis.LetP(s,t):R2↦P3be a homogeneous rational parametrization of a surface:(8)P(s,t)=(a(s,t),b(s,t),c(s,t),d(s,t)),wherea,b,c,d∈R[s,t]are polynomials of bi-degree(m,n)andgcd(a,b,c,d)=1. We assume thatP(s,t)is properly parametrized, i.e., a generically one-to-one parametrization. A moving surface of degree n is a family of algebraic surfaces with parameter pairs(s,t):(9)S(s,t;X)=∑i=1lbi(s,t)fi(X)=0,wherefi(X),i=1,…,lare degree n polynomials, andbi(s,t)∈R[s,t],i=1,…,lare blending functions. A moving surface (9) is said to follow the rational parametrization (8) ifdnS(s,t;a/d,b/d,c/d)≡0.A moving plane is a moving surface of degree one. A moving planeL(s,t;X)=A(s,t)x+B(s,t)y+C(s,t)z+D(s,t)=0will also be denoted by the vector formL(s,t):=(A(s,t),B(s,t),C(s,t),D(s,t))∈R[s,t]4. The set of all moving planes that followP(s,t)forms a module, called the syzygy module ofP(s,t). The syzygy module ofP(s,t)has been proved to be a free module of rank three (Chen et al., 2005).Definition 3.1(See Chen et al., 2005.) Letp(s,t),q(s,t),r(s,t)be three moving planes that follow the parametrization (8). Thenp,q,rare said to be a μ-basis forP(s,t)ifp,q,rform a basis for the syzygy module ofP(s,t).11Strictly speaking, a μ-basis is essentially defined for a parametrization. For an algebraic surface that has rational parametrizations, if we adopt another parametrization of the surface, we shall get different μ-bases for the new parametrization. However, in later context, sometimes when we say “a μ-basis for a cyclide”, we are referring to a μ-basis for a certain parametrization of the cyclide.Sometimes we also refer to the three polynomialsp(s,t;X):=p⋅X,q(s,t;X):=q⋅X,r(s,t;X):=r⋅Xas a μ-basis.Lemma 3.1(SeeChen et al., 2005.) Three moving planesp,q,rform a μ-basis forP(s,t)if and only if[p,q,r]=λP(s,t)for some nonzero constant λ. Here[p,q,r]is the wedge product ofp,q,rdefined by[p,q,r]=(|p2p3p4q2q3q4r2r3r4|,−|p1p3p4q1q3q4r1r3r4|,|p1p2p4q1q2q4r1r2r4|,−|p1p2p3q1q2q3r1r2r3|).Definition 3.2(See Chen et al., 2005.) A μ-basisp,q,rforP(s,t)is said to form a minimal μ-basis in total degree ifdeg(p)+deg(q)+deg(r)is minimal among all μ-bases forP(s,t), wheredeg(⋅)is the total degree in(s,t);p,q,ris said to form a minimal μ-basis in bi-degree if bothdegs(p)+degs(q)+degs(r)anddegt(p)+degt(q)+degt(r)are the smallest among all μ-bases forP(s,t), wheredegs(⋅)anddegt(⋅)are partial degree in s and t.Note 1A minimal μ-basis (either in total degree or in bidegree) does not always exist for an arbitrarily given rational surface. Please see Chen et al. (2005) for detailed discussions.We state the following claim for later use.Lemma 3.2Let N be a nonsingular4×4constant matrix, and letN−t:=(N−1)t=(Nt)−1represent the inverse of the transpose of N. Suppose thatp,q,rare a μ-basis forP(s,t). ThenpN−t,qN−t,rN−tare a μ-basis for the parametrizationPN.Sincep⋅P≡0, i.e.,Ppt≡0, we have(PN)⋅(pN−t)=(PN)(pN−t)t=PNN−1pt=Ppt≡0.Similarly we have(PN)⋅(qN−t)≡0and(PN)⋅(rN−t)≡0. HencepN−t⊥PN,qN−t⊥PN,rN−t⊥PN.Thus, there exists a rational polynomialλ(s,t)such that(10)[pN−t,qN−t,rN−t]=λ(s,t)PN.Considering that the parametrization P is proper and hence its four components have no common polynomial factors, and that the left of Eq. (10) is a polynomial vector, the functionλ(s,t)is in fact a polynomial. Letdeg(P)denote the highest total degree of the four componentsa(s,t),b(s,t),c(s,t),d(s,t)inP(s,t). Since N is nonsingular,deg(P)=deg(PN). To see this, assume that the leading coefficient vector ofP(s,t)is(k1,k2,k3,k4), wherekiare not all zero constants. Thendeg(PN)<deg(P)if and only if each of the four columns in N is a solution for(n1,n2,n3,n4)of the equationk1n1+k2n2+k3n3+k4n4=0, which is impossible for a nonsingular matrix N since the equation has only three linearly independent solutions. We similarly havedeg(pN−t)=deg(p),deg(qN−t)=deg(q),deg(rN−t)=deg(r). Hence by Eq. (10), we havedeg(PN)=deg(P)=deg(p)+deg(q)+deg(r)=deg(pN−t)+deg(qN−t)+deg(rN−t). Therefore,λ(s,t)must be a constant. By Lemma 3.1,pN−t,qN−t,rN−tare a μ-basis for the parametrizationPN.  □Now we come back to the biquadratic rational parametrization (6) of cyclides. Denote the homogeneous parametrizationP(s,t):R2↦P3ofPˆ(s,t)by:(11)P(s,t)=(P1(s,t),P2(s,t),P3(s,t),P4(s,t)),wherePiare all polynomials of bidegree(2,2)in(s,t). Obviously,L0(s,t;X)=−P3(s,t)y+P2(s,t)z=0is a syzygy of (11). Next we explore two more syzygies for the parametrization (11) from the two families of curvature spheres of the cyclide.Equations of the two sphere familiesF1andF2are given by(12)S1(s;X):=‖X−h1(s)‖2−r1(s)2=0,S2(t;X):=‖X−h2(t)‖2−r2(t)2=0,where X is temporarily set as the vector(x,y,z)instead of(x,y,z,1). Two moving planes can be derived from (12):(13)L1(s;X):=∂(S1(s;X))∂s=0,L2(t;X):=∂S2(t;X)∂t=0.By Eqs. (3) and (4),h1(s),r1(s)have denominator1+s2for tori and general cyclides. HenceS1(s;X)andL1(s;X)are rational functions with denominators(1+s2)2and(1+s2)3, respectively. We now remove these denominators and denote the corresponding polynomial numerators still byS1(s;X)andL1(s;X). Similarly,h2(t),r2(t)have denominator1−t2for tori and general cyclides. HenceS2(s;X)andL2(s;X)are rational functions with denominators(1−t2)2and(1−t2)3, respectively. Remove these denominators and denote the corresponding polynomial numerators still byS2(s;X)andL2(s;X). For parabolic Dupin cyclides, Eq. (12) and Eq. (13) are already polynomials,i=1,2. Now we can letd1=gcd(S1(s;X),L1(s,X)),d2=gcd(S2(t;X),L2(t,X)).By representations ofhi,ri,i=1,2in Lemma 2.1, for tori and for general Dupin cyclides(14)d1=1+s2,d2=1−t2,while for parabolic cyclides(15)d1=1,d2=1.Hence we define polynomials(16)S˜1(s;X)=S1(s;X)/d1,L˜1(s;X)=L1(s;X)/d1;S˜2(t;X)=S2(t;X)/d2,L˜2(t;X)=L2(t;X)/d2.A direct symbolic computation yieldsProposition 4.1Both of the moving planesL˜1(s;X)=0andL˜2(t;X)=0follow the parametrizationP(s,t)in(11).Let the coefficient vectors ofL0(s,t;X),L˜1(s;X),L˜2(t;X)with respect to(x,y,z,1)beL0(s,t),L˜1(s),L˜2(t). ThenProposition 4.2[L0(s,t),L˜1(s),L˜2(t)]=stP(s,t).ProofSubstituting Eqs. (3)–(5) throughout one can check the result by direct symbolic computation. The extraneous factor st indicates that whens=0ort=0, the three moving planes are linearly dependent, i.e., pass through a common line. □The implicit equation of the cyclide can be derived in the following way.Theorem 4.1The implicit equation of the cyclide is given byF(X)=gcd(Ress(S˜1(s;X),L˜1(s;X)),Rest(S˜2(t;X),L˜2(t;X)))=0.To see this, just recall that each of the two families of spheres envelopes the cyclide. Actually we haveProposition 4.3Ress(S˜1(s;X),L˜1(s;X))=F(X)Q1(X),Rest(S˜2(t;X),L˜2(t;X))=F(X)Q2(X),whereF(X)=0is the implicit equation of the cyclide, andgcd(Q1(X),Q2(X))=1.One can check Proposition 4.3 by substituting Eqs. (3)–(5) to write outF(X),Q1(X),Q2(X)explicitly:•Torus(17)F(X)=(x2+y2+z2−r2+R2)2−4R2(x2+y2),Q1(X)=x2+y2,Q2(X)=r2−z2.General cyclide(18)F(X)=(x2+y2+z2−f2+b2)2−4(ax−cf)2−4b2y2,Q1(X)=(−4ax−4bIy+4cf)(−4ax+4bIy+4cf),Q2(X)=(4cx+4bz−4af)(4cx−4bz−4af).Parabolic cyclide(19)F(X)=(x+f)(x2+y2+z2)+(y2−z2)c−(c2+f2)x+(c2−f2)f,Q1(X)=x−c+f,Q2(X)=x+c+f.Remark 4.2Actually, the extraneous factorsQ1(X)andQ2(X)in Eqs. (17) and (18) are the limiting planes of the moving spheresF1andF2when their radius functionsr1(s)andr2(t)go to infinity. One can check thatQ1(X)=L˜1(I;X)L˜1(−I;X),Q2(X)=L˜2(1;X)L˜2(−1;X).We next derive a μ-basis for the parametrization (11) from the three syzygiesL0(s,t),L˜1(s),L˜2(t).LetR(s,t)be the field of fractions ofR[s,t]. If we can compute three other syzygiesp,q,rthat satisfy Lemma 3.1 byR(s,t)-combinations of the three known syzygies, the three new syzygies will serve as a μ-basis for the syzygy module ofP(s,t).We write outL0(s,t),L˜1(s),L˜2(t)explicitly (with nonzero constant multiples in each row removed) for the three types of standard cyclides separately.•Torus.L0=(0,−r(1+s2)t,(R+r)t2s+(R−r)s,0),L˜1=(2s,(s2−1),0,0),L˜2=(0,0,−(1+t2),2rt).Letr=L0−rt⁎L˜1+(R−r)s⁎L˜22rst,q=L˜2+t⁎r,p=L˜1+s⁎r.Then(20)p=(s,−1,st,(R−r)s),q=(−t,−st,−1,(R+r)t),r=(−1,−s,t,R−r).General cyclide.L0=(0,−(c+f)s2t−(f−c)t,(a+f)st2+(a−f)s,0),L˜1=(2as,bs2−b,0,−2fcs),L˜2=(−2ct,0,−bt2−b,2aft).Letr=L0+(c−f)t⁎p+(a−f)s⁎L˜22fst,q=L˜2+t⁎r,p=L˜1+s⁎r.Then(21)p=((c+a)s,−b,bst,(b2−af−fc)s),q=(−(c+a)t,−bst,−b,(b2+fc+af)t),r=(c−a,−bs,bt,b2+fc−af).Note that Eq. (21) agrees with Eq. (20) by lettinga=b=R,c=0andf=r.Parabolic cyclide.L0=(0,−2cs2t−(2f+c)t,2cst2+(c−2f)s,0),L˜1=(−s,−1,0,(c−f)s),L˜2=(t,0,−1,(c+f)t).Letp=L˜1,q=L˜2,r=−(2f+c)t⁎L˜1+(c−2f)s⁎L˜22cst.Then(22)p=(−s,−1,0,(c−f)s),q=(t,0,−1,(c+f)t),r=(1,−s,t,−f).Theorem 5.1p,q,rin(20),(21)and(22)form a μ-basis for the corresponding parametrizationP(s,t)in(11).ProofBy symbolic computation one can check that[p,q,r]=λP(s,t)for some nonzero constant λ.  □Note 2The computedp,q,rin (20), (21) and (22) for the three types of standard cyclides are minimal μ-bases in total degree. For parabolic cyclides this fact is obvious sincedeg(p)=deg(q)=deg(r)=1. For tori and general cyclides, by substituting a degree one moving planeL(s,t)with undetermined coefficients ins,tinto the equationL(s,t)⋅P(s,t)≡0, one can easily verify that there are no other moving planes of total degree one in(s,t)that follows the parametrization of the cyclide except r; hence the lowest total degree we can get fordeg(p)+deg(q)+deg(r)is five.However, the computed μ-basisp,q,rfor a torus or a general cyclide does not form a minimal μ-basis in the sense of bi-degree. Actually, one can check that for a torus or a general Dupin cyclide,L˜1,q,ralso form of μ-basis. Note thatp,q,rare all of bi-degree(1,1)andL˜1is of bi-degree(2,0). Hence if there is a minimal μ-basis in the sense of bi-degree, the sum ofdegs(⋅)for this minimal μ-basis should be less than or equal todegs(p)+degs(q)+degs(r)=3, and the sum ofdegt(⋅)should be less than or equal todegt(L˜1)+degt(q)+degt(r)=2, which indicates that there is a univariate moving planeL(s)followingP(s,t). This contradicts the fact thatr(s,t)is the only moving plane of total degree one followingP(s,t). It is also easy to verify that the computed μ-basisp,q,rin (22) for a parabolic cyclide is minimal even in the sense of bi-degree.The following result holds for μ-basesp,q,rwe have obtained above of all the three types of cyclides.Theorem 5.2Ress,t(p⋅X,q⋅X,r⋅X)=yF(X),whereF(X)=0is the implicit equation of the standard cyclide, and the resultant is the usual multivariate resultant, i.e., determinant of the coefficient matrix ofp,sp,q,sq,r,srwith respect to the basis[1,s,t,st,s2,s2t].From Theorem 5.2, one can see that unlike the case for curves, a direct resultant of μ-bases does not generate the implicit equation of a surface without extraneous factors. Please refer to Chen et al. (2005) for the same observation, where they have a deeper analysis and point out that the extraneous factor y might arise because the μ-bases fail to form a basis for the homogeneous syzygy module.Nevertheless, we can achieve a clean implicitization by the technique of moving surfaces shown in Sederberg and Chen (1995). Since torus is a special case for general cyclide, we show only the technique for general cyclides and parabolic cyclides.Proposition 5.1Letp,q,rbe a μ-basis in the form(21)for the parametrization(11)of standard general Dupin cyclides. Write(23)p⋅X=p1(X)+p2(X)s+p3(X)t+p4(X)st,q⋅X=q1(X)+q2(X)s+q3(X)t+q4(X)st,r⋅X=r1(X)+r2(X)s+r3(X)t+r4(X)st.Then there exists a moving planeL(s,t)that isR-linearly independent fromp,q,rand of the formL(s,t)⋅X=L1(X)+L1(X)s+L2(X)t+L3(X)st=0such that the implicit equation of the cyclide is given by(24)F(X)=|p1(X)p2(X)p3(X)p4(X)q1(X)q2(X)q3(X)q4(X)r1(X)r2(X)r3(X)r4(X)L1(X)L2(X)L3(X)L4(X)|=0.The existence of this moving planeL(s,t)can be shown by symbolically solving for the undetermined coefficients ofLi(X),i=1,2,3,4from the equationL(s,t)⋅P(s,t)≡0. Note that sinceL(s,t)is a Syzygy ofP(s,t),L(s,t)must be aR[s,t]-combination ofp,q,r; however,P(s,t)can beR-linearly independent fromp,q,r. An exampleL(s,t)adapting withp,q,rin (21) isL=[(c−a)st+(c+a)t,bst+bt,bs+b,−(b2+af−cf)st−(b2+af+cf)t].□One can also check the following:Proposition 5.2Letp,q,rbe a μ-basis in the form(22)for the parametrization(11)of standard parabolic cyclides. Write(25)p⋅X:=p1(X)+p2(X)s+p3(X)t,q⋅X:=q1(X)+q2(X)s+q3(X)t,r⋅X:=r1(X)+r2(X)s+r3(X)t.Then the implicit equation of the cyclide is given byF(X)=|p1(X)p2(X)p3(X)q1(X)q2(X)q3(X)r1(X)r2(X)r3(X)|=0.Till now, our discussion is all about standard cyclides. Since a cyclide in general position and orientation can always be transformed to a standard cyclide via Euclidean transformations, all those properties of μ-bases for standard cyclides also apply to μ-bases for cyclides in general position and orientation. Next we show how to compute a μ-basis for a cyclide in general position and orientation from a given implicit equation. Note that in this general given implicit equation, the center position, orientation, as well as all the characteristic values of the cyclide are hidden. Our first goal is to extract all this information from the given degree four algebraic equation.LetX=(x,y,z,1),X˜=(x˜,y˜,z˜,1),X′=(x′,y′,z′,1), andX,X˜,X′be their corresponding variable set. LetG(X)=0be the given implicit equation of a cyclide in general position and orientation.G(X)=0can be transformed to a standard cyclideG′(X′)=0via•a translationX˜t=TXtthat moves the center of the cyclide to the origin, anda rotationX′t=U′tX˜tthat adjusts its symmetric planes toz=0andy=0.Proposition 6.1Letp,q,rbe a μ-basis for the standard cyclideG′(X′)=0. Then a μ-basis for the cyclideG(X)=0in general position and orientation is given byp(U′tT),q(U′tT),r(U′tT).ProofJust notice that the matrix N in Lemma 3.2 isN=(U′tT)−t.  □We next show how to quickly determine the matrices T andU′fromG(X)=0. By Eq. (18), a standard general cyclide has the implicit equation(26)(x2+y2+z2−f2+b2)2−4(ax−cf)2−4b2y2=0.SinceG(X)=0is transformed from (26) via a rigid motion consisting of rotation and/or translation,G(X)=0can be written in the form(27)G(X)=A(X)2+2B(X)A(X)+C(X)=0,where(28)A(X)=x2+y2+z2B(X)=b1x+b2y+b3zC(X)=c1x2+c2y2+c3z2+c4xy+c5yz+c6xz+c7x+c8y+c9z+c10,with constantsbiandcj,i=1,…,3,j=1,…,10.•Center position.Note that only the translationX˜t=TXtcreates degree 3 terms in (27). We formulate Eq. (27) as follows:(29)A2+2BA+C=(A+B)2−B2+C=Q2−2δQ+δ2−B2+C,where(30)δ:=(b12)2+(b22)2+(b32)2andQ=(x+b12)2+(y+b22)2+(z+b32)2. Then the center of the cyclideG(X)=0is at(−b12,−b22,−b32).Hence under the transformation(31)X˜t=TXtwhereT:=(1b121b221b321),the center of the cyclideG˜(X˜)=0is now at the origin.Orientation (symmetric planes).Letr˜=x˜2+y˜2+z˜2. ThenG˜(X˜)=0can be written as(32)G˜(X˜)=r˜2−2δr˜+δ2−B˜2+C˜=0,where δ is the constant given by (30),B˜is linear inX˜, andC˜contains up to quadratic terms inX˜. We next need to adjust the orientation, in other words, the symmetric planes of the cyclideG˜(X˜)=0to the planesy=0andz=0. Observe that the quadratic matrix M corresponding to the quadric terms ofG˜(X˜)isM=(c1−2δ−b12c42−b1b2c62−b1b3c42−b1b2c2−2δ−b22c52−b2b3c62−b1b3c52−b2b3c3−2δ−b32).Since the matrix M is symmetric, there exists an orthogonal matrix U withUtU=1such that(33)M=U(λ1λ2λ3)Ut,whereλiare eigenvalues of M arranged byλ1⩽λ2⩽λ3, and the matrixU=[u1,u2,u3]whereuiare the eigenvectors (column vector) ofλi,i=1,2,3. Then the transformation(34)X′t=U′tX˜t,whereU′=(U001)sends the cyclide (32) to a standard cyclideG′(X′)=0, except that we may need to change the orientation of the x-axis. Note that the coefficient of the linear term in x of Eq. (26) is8acf, which is a positive number. Hence if the corresponding coefficient ofG′(X′)inx′is negative, then we adjust U byu1=−u1,u2=−u2.Values ofa,c,f.The implicit equation of standard cyclides is(35)(x2+y2+z2+b2−f2)2−4(ax−cf)2−4b2y2,whose quadratic terms are−2(a2+c2+f2)x2−2(b2+f2)y2+2(b2−f2)z2.Then the constantsa,b,c,fcan be solved for from the following system of equations (remembera2=b2+c2):(36){λ1=−2(a2+c2+f2)λ2=−2(b2+f2)λ3=2(b2−f2),whereλ1,λ2,λ3are the eigenvalues of the matrix M in Eq. (33).Note 3Note that−2(a2+c2+f2)⩽−2(b2+f2)⩽0⩽2(b2−f2), and we already arrangedλiin our eigenvalue decomposition of M so thatλ1⩽λ2⩽λ3. Hence the correspondence of the left and right hand sides in Eq. (36) is correct and we need not permute the order ofλi.Remark 6.1The approach shown in this section can also decide whether a given quartic algebraic equation represents a cyclide. By extracting the center position, orientation, as well as the characteristic values of the cyclide, one can then write out the parametric equation of the cyclide. A μ-basis for this parametrization can also be obtained through computing a basis of the syzygy module of this parametrization. However, this last parametrization step is unnecessary, since once we get all the geometric information from the implicit equation, a μ-basis can be directly written out.We now illustrate by example the whole process of computing a μ-basis for a cyclide in general position and orientation from its implicit equation.Example 7.1Suppose the implicit equation of a cyclide is given by:(37)G(X)=x4+2x2y2+2x2z2+y4+2y2z2+z4+23x3−2x2y+23xy2+23xz2−2y3−2yz2−68x2−203xy−88y2+2z2+240x−623x+62y+2403y−639=0.Then(38)A(X)=x2+y2+z2B(X)=3x−yC(X)=−68x2−203xy−88y2+2z2+240x−623x+2403y+62y−639.Thusb1=3,b2=−1,b3=0. Hence the center of the cyclide is at(−32,12,0), andδ=(b12)2+(b22)2+(b32)2=1. Then the translation matrix isT=(1321−12101).SubstitutingX˜t=TXtinto (37) we get(39)G˜(X˜)=x˜4+2x˜2y˜2+2x˜2z˜2+y˜4+2y˜2z˜2+z˜4−73x˜2−183x˜y˜−91y˜2+240x˜+2403y˜−576=0.From the coefficients ofB(X)andC(X)we write down the matrix M:M=(−73−930−93−910000).Decompose the matrix M toM=ULUTfor an orthogonal matrix U and a diagonal matrix L with elements as eigenvalues of M:U=(12−32032120001),L=(−100−640).Thus the rotation matrixU′=(U1).SubstitutingX′t=U′tX˜tinto (39) we get(40)G′(X′)=x′4+y′4+z′4+2x′2y′2+2z′2x′2+2z′2y′2−100x′2−64y′2+480x′−576=0,which is centered at the origin and hasz=0andy=0as the symmetric planes. The coefficient of (40) in the linear term inx′is positive, hence we need not modifyU′. Solving for the values ofa,b,c,ffrom the equation system{λ1=−100=−2(a2+c2+f2),λ2=−64=−2(b2+f2),λ3=0=2(b2−f2),we geta=5,b=f=4,c=3.Substituting the values ofa,b,c,finto (21), we get a μ-basis for the cyclideG′(X′)=0:(41)p=(8s,−4,4st,−16s),q=(−8t,−4st,−4,48t),r=(−2,−4s,4t,8).By Theorem 3.2, a μ-basis for the cyclideG(X)=0is:(42)p(U′tT)=(4s+23,43s−2,4st,−16s+4),q(U′tT)=(23st−4t,−2st−43t,−4,4st+48t),r(U′tT)=(23s−1,−2s−3,4t,4s+8).The parametrizationP(s,t)for the cyclideG(X)=0is[p(U′tT),q(U′tT),r(U′tT)]=−16(3s2t2+12s2t2+363t2s+43t2−24t2+43s2−8s2+43s+3−4,−s2t2+123s2t2−36t2s−4t2−243t2−4s2−83s2−4s−1−43,−8(7s2+1)t,−2s2t2−8t2−8s2−2).LetP(s,t)be a biquadratic parametrization of a cyclide in general position and orientation, and letp,q,rbe a μ-basis forP(s,t). ThenProposition 8.1The parameters corresponding to a pointQ=(x0,y0,z0,w0)onP(s,t)are given by the solution for(s,t)of the equations(43)p⋅Q=q⋅Q=r⋅Q=0.ProofThis directly follows from the fact thatp⋅P(s,t)=q⋅P(s,t)=r⋅P(s,t)=0.Eq. (43) contains three polynomial equations of bidegree(1,1)in(s,t), the last of which is of total degree one in(s,t). We write these equations as(44)a0st+a1s+a2t+a3=0,b0st+b1s+b2t+b3=0,c0s+c1t+c2=0,whereai,bi,cjare constantsi=0,…,3,j=0,…,2. For tori and general cyclides,a0,b0are generically not zero. Substituting the last equation in (44) into the first two, we get two univariate quadratic polynomial equationsf1(t)=0andf2(t)=0. The t-parameters corresponding to the point Q are roots ofgcd(f1(t),f2(t)). This approach is much more efficient than directly solvingP(s,t)=kQfor(s,t), which contains four polynomial equations of bi-degree(2,2)involving three parameterss,t,k.  □Rational surfaces in three dimension always have μ-bases (Chen et al., 2005). Dupin cyclides are rational surfaces of bidegree(2,2)that are enveloped by two families of spheres. From these two families of spheres we get two moving planes that follow the rational parametrization of the cyclide. We show that the implicit equation of the cyclide is just the GCD of two resultants constructed from the two families of moving spheres and their corresponding moving planes. Starting from these two moving planes, together with an obvious syzygy of the parametrization, we derive three explicit moving planes that form a μ-basis for the standard cyclides that are centered at the origin and havey=0andz=0as the two planes of symmetry. The implicit equation of the cyclide can be represented by μ-bases without producing any extraneous factors. For cyclides in general position and orientation, we show how to extract their center position, orientation, as well as the four characteristic values, so that we can obtain their μ-bases from the explicit μ-bases for the corresponding standard cyclides. At the end we also present an application of μ-bases for easy inversion formula computation for cyclides.In the future, we hope to extract the geometric invariants of a cyclide from its rational parametric representation, and also to develop an algorithm for computing μ-bases for cyclides directly from the rational parametrizations of the cyclides. Another possible extension of this work is computing μ-bases for canal surfaces. Canal surfaces with rational spine curves and rational radius functions are known to be rational. Hence by Chen et al. (2005)μ-bases for canal surfaces always exist. However, even an explicit representation for the parametrization is lacking, hence a μ-basis computation might be even harder. One possible moving surface to look at is the moving sphere that envelopes the canal surface, but we need more. Cyclides are at this point very special, since they are enveloped simultaneously by two moving spheres.
