@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A hierarchical modeling of planar steel frames that is based on a weak coupling of shell and beam computational models is studied in detail. A shell finite element is used to compute failure response of a representative part of each column and each beam of a frame under consideration; elasto-plasticity, geometrical nonlinearity and material softening (along with a localization limiter) are taken into account. The computed results, which naturally include local buckling and/or localized material failure effects, are further incorporated into a beam inelastic stress-resultant constitutive model; the embedded-discontinuity-in-rotation Euler–Bernoulli finite element is considered in this work. The designed beam finite element formulation can be effectively used for the failure analysis of the steel frame. Important issues of such weak coupling concept are presented and results of several numerical simulations are discussed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A hierarchical approach to structural modeling is advantageous in many engineering applications. In general, it involves coupling of a higher-level computational model with a lower-level one. In the hierarchical modeling of planar steel frames the shell and the beam finite element formulations can represent the former and the latter, respectively. The shell model can capture localized instabilities (of both material and geometrical types) that are completely unseen by the beam model; however, the modeling effort and the computational cost could be very large if only shell elements are used to model the entire structure. The beam model offers effective and robust analysis; the beam analysis results are also more suitable for the design purposes. By coupling the models, the best of both worlds can be combined. The coupling can be done in a strong way; in that case, the finite element model of a frame consists of beam and shell elements, as well as of constraints connecting both element types in a consistent manner (e.g. [39,9]). The coupling of the computational models can be also weak (e.g. [2,14]). In that case, the shell element is used to compute the failure response of a representative part of each subsystem of a frame under consideration; this information is further incorporated into the beam element that is used for the analysis of the entire frame. Thus, the weak coupling concept involves carrying out sequential shell and beam computations.In this work, we present, illustrate, and make an assessment of the weak coupling concept for the analysis of planar steel frames made of I-cross-section beams and columns. We note that the concept can be also applied for other frame member geometries, e.g. with I-cross-section and transverse (and longitudinal) reinforcements (e.g. [34]). We aim to compute the response of a steel frame under static load beyond its limit point. In the earthquake engineering, this kind of computation is called the push-over analysis; we will call it here the failure analysis. An accurate yet fairly simple failure analysis of steel frames is of great practical interest. The failure analysis is an indispensable tool in order to obtain important design parameters, such as the limit load, the limit ductility, and the failure mode.Under large loads, a frame member may undergo plastic deformations. Moreover, plastic strain localization (i.e. material softening) and local buckling may occur. Inelastic geometrically nonlinear beam finite elements cannot capture automatically those complex effects. However, they can be implicitly included into the beam finite element formulation by using the weak coupling concept suggested in [14] that can be summarized as:(a)Use a geometrically and materially nonlinear (i.e. elasto-plastic) shell finite element formulation (see e.g. [8,31,29,7,16,40,36,11,15]) in order to study response of the representative part of a frame member (RPFM) up to its complete collapse. Such a response naturally includes local buckling and/or steel localized failure, since the RPFM fails due to a subtle combination of localized material failure and local buckling. The shell element should be able to model branching shells: either by using a shell formulation with the drilling rotation (see e.g. [18,19,25,42]) or by using a shell formulation with rotations that transforms the two local rotations into the three global ones at the nodes where different branches of the shell meet (e.g. [32]) or yet by using a rotation-less solid-shell formulation (e.g. [38,13]). Also, the effect of the mesh-dependency at steel softening (i.e. at localized steel failure) has to be minimized. For that purpose a localization limiter (see e.g. [20]), or a more rigorous and complex approach, like the extended finite element method (X-FEM) (see e.g. [3,4]), is to be used.Incorporate the results obtained by the shell finite element into the stress-resultant beam inelastic constitutive model. In this work, we make use of the embedded-discontinuity-in-rotation Euler–Bernoulli beam finite element described in [5,14,21], which can model perfectly well, without mesh-dependency, the cross-section softening as well as the frame softening. The geometric nonlinearity has to be taken into account in the beam formulation, at least in its simplest form of the von Karman type (see e.g. [27,14]).Use the beam finite element, designed under (b) above, for an effective failure analysis of the entire steel frame; such an analysis is fast and implicitly takes into account localized failures of frame members. An arc-length method that functions well for softening problems has to be applied in order to be able to perform complete failure analysis (see e.g. [26,35] and references therein).In what follows, we study in detail some aspects of the above described weak coupling concept that were not given attention in [14]; yet they are of highest importance for its practical use. We discuss, in particular, the following issues: (i) the choice of the length of the representative part of the frame member, (ii) the consistent incorporation of the results of the shell computations into the beam finite element formulation, (iii) the ability of the von-Karman-type nonlinearity to approximate the global geometrically nonlinear effects of a frame structure, (iv) the choice of the cross-section yield criterion, (v) the comparison of the results of shell computations with other engineering approaches that can be used to obtain the moment–curvature relation for a beam cross-section, (vi) the ability of the presented weak coupling concept to accurately predict the limit load, the limit ductility, the failure mode, and the failure response of a steel frame. By studying the above, a fairly complete assessment of the weak coupling procedure proposed in [14] is given; this is also the main motivation for the present work.The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. The weak coupling concept for steel frame analysis is briefly presented in Section 2. The shell and the beam finite elements that are used in this work are described in Section 3. In Section 4, the results of shell computations for HEA340 and HEB300 are presented and discussed. In Section 5, examples of steel frame analysis are shown and conclusions are drawn in Section 6.A weak coupling procedure of shell and beam computational models is presented in this section.By using shell finite elements, we compute response of a representative part of a frame member (RPFM) (Fig. 1), under a constant value of the end-forceNand a changing value of the end-momentM. The geometric nonlinearity and theJ2elasto-plasticity are taken into account (see e.g. textbooks [10,6,12,20] for general disposition on those topics). Any of the elasto-plastic geometrically nonlinear shell finite element formulations, mentioned in Section 1(a), is a good candidate to be used. Considering symmetry, only one half of the RPFM is modeled. Several possible boundary conditions are shown inFig. 2: in this work, the boundary conditions (a2) with the deformation-following end-forceNare applied; in [14] the boundary conditions (c1) were used. In all the cases, shown in Fig. 2, the non-clamped end is constrained to the centroid of the corresponding cross-section by the rigid kinematic links.In the analysis, the end-forceNis applied first; positiveNinduces tension. Next, the rotation of the non-clamped end is increased at holding the value ofNfixed – up to the complete structural failure of the RPFM. In order to minimize the mesh-dependency of results, due to a use of the strain-softening plasticity, one has to use a localization limiter. We use the simplest localization limiter among long list of possibilities (see e.g. [20]) the linear stress–strain softening modulus is adjusted with respect to the characteristic length of the elements in the mesh:(1)Ksofle=−leσu22gswhereσu(the uniaxial ultimate stress) andgs(the fracture energy per unit area) are experimental data for chosen steel andleis the characteristic length of the finite elements in the mesh.The aim is to perform an analysis of the RPFM with the axial force and the bending moment being constant along its length. However, we can only have an approximate constant stress state along the length of the RPFM due to the geometrical nonlinearity. Neither the axial force of the cross-sections equals exactlyNnor the cross-sections bending moment equals exactlyM. In what follows, we will neglect the former fact; we will assume that the axial force at any cross-section along the RPFM equals to the applied end-forceN.Fig. 3 shows a computed end-moment versus end-rotation curve for the RPFM at a fixed value of the end-forceN. It consists of: (i) linear elastic phase forφ∈[0,φy]andM∈[0,My]; (ii) hardening phase forφ∈[φy,φuref]andM∈[My,Muref]; (iii) softening phase, due to local flange buckling and/or localization of plastic strains, whereMdecreases at increasing rotation. The ultimate applied end-moment is denoted asMuref. However, at the cross-section that fails first, the ultimate moment is (seeFig. 4)(2)Muref′=Muref+NeFig. 5 shows the plastic work of the RPFM versus the end-rotation curve. The plastic work is computed as(3)EWp,ref(φ)=2∫0tatφ∫Vσ:ε̇pldVdtwhereσare the 2nd Piola–Kirchhoff stresses andεplare the Green–Lagrange plastic strains,tis the pseudo-time,Vis the volume of the analyzed one half of the RPFM at the initial configuration, and the dot represents the pseudo-time derivative. We denote the plastic work done up toM=MurefasE¯Wp,ref. The plastic work done at the complete collapse of the RPFM isE¯Wp,ref+E¯¯Wp,ref(see Fig. 5). Here, and in what follows, the one-bar-notation relates to the hardening response (ii) and the two-bar-notation relates to the softening response (iii) (see Fig. 3). Thus,E¯Wp,refis the plastic work done before the ultimate loadMurefis reached, andE¯¯Wp,refis the plastic work done in the softening response of the RPFM.The beam computational model that is considered in this work is the stress-resultant embedded-discontinuity Euler–Bernoulli finite element, which is briefly described in Section 3.2 below (see also [5,14,21]). Its special feature is that the bending softening hinge is activated within an element at the outset of the failure process of a critical cross-section. Thus, it needs two material models; one for the bulk of the beam and one for the softening hinge. Due to the Euler–Bernoulli-type beam finite element, the constitutive relation for the shear force is not needed; the axial response is assumed as elastic.As for the material model for the bending of the bulk of the beam, we choose the stress-resultant elasto-plasticity with a linear isotropic hardening (seeFig. 6 (left) andFig. 7 (left)); theKh≥0is the bending hardening modulus. The interaction between the beam bending moment and the beam axial force is taken into account implicitly by making bilinear moment–curvature curve dependent on the level of the axial force. As for the beam bending softening hinge, we choose the rigid-plasticity with a linear softening with the modulusKs<0(see Fig. 6 (right) and Fig. 7 (right)); the softening line also depends on the level of the axial force. Detailed derivation of the beam stress-resultant bending elasto-plasticity and beam stress-resultant bending rigid-plasticity can be found e.g. in [14,21] (see also [20] for the 1d elasto-plasticity). The parameters of the inelastic beam material models can be determined when curves from Figs. 3 and 5 are available for several levels of the axial force; recall that it is assumed throughout this work that the axial force is constant along the RPFM and equals to N.For a particular value ofN, the plastic work rate of a beam cross-section in the hardening phase is (see [14])(4)W¯p=Mbeamκ¯̇p=|Mbeam|ξ¯̇=(My+Khξ¯)ξ¯̇whereκ¯pis the plastic curvature,Mbeamis the cross-section moment,My>0is the yield moment, andξ¯≥0is a curvature-like variable that controls the hardening of the cross-section. From Fig. 7 (left) it can be observed thatξ¯at the ultimate cross-section momentMu>0is(5)ξ¯˜=Mu−MyKhBy performing the pseudo-time integration of (4), and by replacing it with the integration over theξ¯, and one gets the plastic work done by a single cross-section. The plastic work done by the RPFM is:(6)E¯Wp=∫0Lref∫0tatξ¯˜W¯pdtdL=∫0Lref∫0ξ¯˜(My+Khξ¯)dξ¯dL=∫0Lref(Mu2−My2)2KhdL=Lref(Mu2−My2)2KhIt has been assumed in (6) thatMyandMuare constant along the axis of the RPFM. Since they both depend on the axial force, this is equivalent to an assumption that the axial force is constant along the length of the RPFM; in other words, geometrical linearity has been considered to computeE¯Wpin (6).The plastic work rate of a bending softening plastic hinge is (see [14])(7)W¯¯p=tMα̇=|tM|ξ¯¯̇={(Mu+Ksξ¯¯)ξ¯¯̇if(Mu+Ksξ¯¯)>00if(Mu+Ksξ¯¯)≤0whereαis the plastic rotation of the hinge,tMis the hinge moment, andξ¯¯≥0is the rotation-like variable that controls plastic softening in the hinge. By observing from Fig. 7 (right) that(8)ξ¯¯˜=Mu|Ks|and changing the pseudo-time integration of (7) into the integration over theξ¯¯, one gets the plastic work done in a single softening plastic hinge as(9)E¯¯Wp=E¯¯Wp,1,E¯¯Wp,1=∫0tatξ¯¯˜W¯¯pdt=∫0ξ¯¯˜(Mu−|Ks|ξ¯¯)dξ¯¯=Mu22|Ks|Note, that the softening plastic hinge is of “zero-length”.The parametersMy,Mu,KhandKsfrom Figs. 6 and 7 are the data for the beam material models briefly described in the previous section. The hardening modulusKhand the softening modulusKscan be obtained by exploiting the idea that both the shell computational model and the beam computational model should produce the same amount of the plastic work when used for the analysis of the RPFM [14]; i.e. equating the plastic works at the ultimate load of the RPFM and the plastic works in the softening response of the RPFM should be done:(10)E¯Wp,ref=E¯Wp,E¯¯Wp,ref=E¯¯Wp=E¯¯Wp,1Recall thatMy,Mu,Kh,Ksand plastic works in (6) and (9) depend on the level of the axial force; recall also, that it has been assumed that the axial force does not change along the RPFM and equals to N.One can assume that the yield moment of the cross-sectionMy(N)is associated with the yielding of the most stressed fiber:(11)My(N)=Wσy(1−|N|Ny)whereNy=Aσy, A and W are the cross-section area and the bending resistance modulus of the cross-section, respectively, andσyis the uniaxial yield stress of a used steel. It can also be assumed that the ultimate moment of each cross-section of a beam equals the ultimate moment of the RPFM computed by the shell model:(12)Mu(N)={eitherMuref(N),seeFig.3orMuref′(N),seeEq.(2)From the 1st equation in (10), Eq. (6) and knownE¯Wp,ref, the hardening modulus can be expressed as(13)Kh(N)=(Mu2(N)−My2(N))Lref2E¯Wp,ref(N)From the 2nd equation in (10), Eq. (9) and knownE¯¯Wp,ref, the softening modulus can be obtained as(14)Ks(N)=−Mu2(N)2E¯¯Wp,ref(N)To summarize: the parameters of the beam stress-resultant constitutive modelsMy,Mu,Kh,Ks(shown in Figs. 6 and 7), can be computed with Eqs. (11)–(14) for different levels of the axial force (we assume that it is equal to the applied end-forceN) by using the following results of shell computations:Muref(orMuref′),E¯Wp,refandE¯¯Wp,ref. In such a way the plastic strain localization (i.e. the material softening) and the local buckling effects can be implicitly included into the beam finite element formulation.It should be noted thatE¯Wp,refandE¯¯Wp,refin Sections 2.1–2.3 refer to the complete volume of the RPFM (see Fig. 1), and not to its one half. It is clear that when analyzing one half of the RPFM (see Fig. 2), one computesE¯Wp,ref/2andE¯¯Wp,ref/2. In an analysis, described in Section 2.1, either: (a) one softening region develops per one half of the RPFM or, (b) a single softening region develops at the middle of the RPFM (seeFig. 8). In version (a), one should replace the 2nd equation in (10) withE¯¯Wp,ref/2=E¯¯Wp=E¯¯Wp,1in order to associate plastic work of a single softening region of the shell model with a plastic work of a single softening plastic hinge of the beam model. Eq. (14) should thus change to(15)Ks(N)=−Mu2(N)E¯¯Wp,ref(N)In version (b), Eq. (14) remains unchanged. The case (b) was assumed in [14]. However, locations of softening regions, as predicted by shell computations in Section 4, indicate that case (a) is more common. Fig. 54 in Appendix shows that in the shell computations one softening region (that can be associated with one softening plastic hinge of the beam model) develops per one half of the RPFM. Hence, in the numerical examples below case (a) is assumed, and Eq. (15) is applied to computeKs.Remark 1Instead of (11), one may use the following criterion for the plastic yielding of a beam cross-section(16)(NNy)2+|Mbeam|My0=(1+K^hξ^)whereNandMbeamare the axial force and the bending moment, respectively,My0=Wσy=My(0),K^his a linear isotropic hardening modulus, andξ^is a strain-like internal variable that controls hardening of the cross-section. Note thatK^handξ^have different meanings thanKhandξ¯introduced above (seeFig. 9). The two-curve yield criterion (16) calls for an application of a multi-surface computational algorithm for plasticity (see e.g. [33,15]).Instead of equating the plastic works in order to compute the hardening and the softening moduliKhandKs(see (9)), one could equate the plastic dissipations. The shell model plastic dissipation of the RPFM is computed as(17)EWp,ref,#(φ)=2∫0tatφ∫V(σ:ε̇pl+q(ξ)ξ̇)dVdt=E¯Wp,ref,#+E¯¯Wp,ref,#whereqandξare the stress-like and the stain-like variables, respectively, that control isotropic hardening/softening in a material point. The latter variable can be interpreted as the equivalent plastic strain, which can be defined for the von Mises plasticity asξ̇=2/3||ε̇||pl(see [20]). In (17),E¯Wp,ref,#andE¯¯Wp,ref,#are plastic dissipations in the hardening and the softening responses of the RPFM, respectively (see Fig. 3). As for the beam model, the rate of the plastic dissipation in the hardening phase of a cross-section is(18)W¯p,#=Mbeamκ¯̇p+q¯(ξ¯)ξ¯̇=(My+Kh#ξ¯)ξ¯̇−Kh#ξ¯ξ¯̇=Myξ¯̇where 1d-plasticity relations,ξ¯̇=κ¯̇psign(Mbeam)andq¯=−Kh#ξ¯, were used (see e.g. [20,14]) for details. The beam hardening modulus is obtained by using (18) in place ofW¯pin (6) to getE¯Wp,#and by equating the latter toE¯Wp,ref,#. One gets the hardening modulus as(19)Kh#(N)=My(N)[Mu(N)−My(N)]LrefE¯Wp,ref,#(N)The rate of the plastic dissipation in the softening hinge is(20)W¯¯p,#=tMα̇+q¯¯(ξ¯¯)ξ¯¯̇={(Mu+Ks#ξ¯¯)ξ¯¯̇−Ks#ξ¯¯ξ¯¯̇=Muξ¯¯̇if(Mu+Ks#ξ¯¯)>00if(Mu+Ks#ξ¯¯)≤0where 1d-plasticity relations,ξ¯¯̇=α̇sign(tM)andq¯¯=−Ks#ξ¯¯, were used again. This leads to the softening modulus(21)Ks#(N)=−Mu2(N)E¯¯Wp,ref,#(N)that corresponds to (14). The softening modulus that corresponds to (15) is two times larger thanKs#in (21).Remark 3By assuming that the deformed axis of the RPFM describes part of a circle with radiusLref/φ, the axis curvature can be obtained asκ¯=φ/Lref. This allows for a transformation of aM−φcurve from Fig. 3, which is computed by a shell model, to aMbeam−κ¯bilinear curve and to atM−αlinear curve of a beam model, both presented in Fig. 6. Also the yield momentMymight be chosen in such a way that a shellM−φcurve and a beamMbeam−κ¯Lrefbilinear curve are as close as possible. Such an approach, which is very common in engineering society (see e.g. [2,30]), has not been followed in this work.For shell computations we used a commercial computer code [1] and its 8-node quadrilateral shell finite element S8R5 with reduced mid-surface integration scheme and 5 integration points through the shell thickness. The von Mises small strain elasto-plastic stress-based material model with linear isotropic hardening and linear strain-softening was applied. In all computed cases the finite element mesh consisted of square elements with edge lengthle=2cm. We assumed that the steel quality was S235 according to Eurocode 3 [17]. The idealized nominal stress versus the nominal strain uniaxial curve for the S235 is plotted inFig. 10: the elastic modulus isE=21,000kN/cm2, the nominal yield stress isσy=23.5kN/cm2, the nominal ultimate stress isσu=36kN/cm2and the nominal ultimate strain isεu=0.2; the Poisson׳s ratio isν=0.3. It was assumed that the fracture energy per unit area in Fig. 10 isgs=3.57kN/cm(this is a guessed value rather than data based on measurements), which leads to the softening modulusKsofle=−362.7kN/cm2according to (1) inFig. 11 (left), where the nominal yield stress is drawn with respect to the nominal plastic strainεnompl=εnom−σnom/E.The Abaqus [1] requires that the material uniaxial data for plasticity is provided in the form of the Cauchy (true) stressσtrue=σnom(1+εnom)and the logarithmic strainεln=ln(1+εnom); the plastic logarithmic strain isεlnpl=ln(1+εnom)−σtrue/E. Thus, the lines in Fig. 10 (left) and Fig. 11 (left) are transformed to the lines in Fig. 10 (right) and Fig. 11 (right). The corresponding softening modulus in Fig. 11 (right) isKsofle,⁎=−528.6kN/cm2. The lines in Fig. 11 (right) were provided as the uniaxial data for Abaqus metal elasto-plasticity. We note in passing that the Cauchy stresses are conjugate to the rate of deformations (and not to the logarithmic strains).Remark 4Abaqus stores the plastic work in its output variable ALLPD [1], Section 1.5.5 of Theory guide]. When analyzing one half of the RPFM, as proposed in Section 2.1, ALLPD equals1/2EWp,refin (3).In this section, we will briefly present the stress-resultant Euler–Bernoulli beam finite element with an embedded jump in rotation. The finite element is shown inFig. 12; in order to accommodate a softening plastic hinge, a jump in rotationαis embedded at a distancexdfrom the node 1. The axial displacement is(22)u(x)=Nu(x)u,u={u1,u2}TwhereNuis transposed vector of standard Lagrange interpolation functions for the 2-node beam element. The transverse displacement is(23)v(x,xd)=Nv(x)v+Nθ(x)θ+M^(x,xd)α,v={v1,v2}T,θ={θ1,θ2}TwhereNvandNθare transposed vectors of standard Hermite interpolation functions for the 2-node beam element. FunctionM^is zero at both ends and non-smooth atxd. The first derivative ofM^with respect toxis discontinuous atxd. Hence, its second derivative has two parts: a continuous functionG¯and the Dirac-delta functionδxd(infinite atxdand zero elsewhere). The axial strain and the curvature are(24)ε(x)=dudx=Buu,κ(x,xd)=∂2v∂x2=Bv(x)v+Bθ(x)θ+G¯(x,xd)α︸κ¯+δxdα︸κ¯¯whereBu,BvandBθare the first derivative ofNuand the second derivatives ofNvandNθ, respectively. The curvature is composed of continuous and infinite parts,κ¯andκ¯¯, respectively. The functionG¯is obtained from the requirement that the finite element deforms as two rigid bodies, connected with a rotational hinge atxd, when the rotation capacity of the hinge is zero (seeFig. 13 and [5] for details):(25)G¯(x,xd)=−1+3(1−(2xd/L(e)))(1−(2x/L(e)))L(e)The virtual displacementsδuandδvare interpolated in the same manner as the real ones given in (22) and (23). The virtual axial strain is defined as a variation of the von Karman axial strainε(x)=(du/dx)+(1/2)(∂v/∂x)2leading to:(26)δε(x)=d(δu)dx+∂v∂x∂(δv)∂x=Buδu+CdNv(x)dx︸Buvδv+CdNθ(x)dx︸Buθδθ+CdM^(x)dx︸BuαδαC=dNv(x)dxv+dNθ(x)dxθ+dM^(x)dxαwhere [21](27)dM^(x)dx=H(xd)−4xL+3x2L2+6xxdL2−6x2xdL3,H(xd)={0forx<xd1forx≥xdThe virtual curvature is given as(28)δκ(x,xd)=∂2(δv)∂x2=Bv(x)δv+Bθ(x)δθ+(G¯(x,xd)+δxd)δαThe virtual work equation for an element isGint,(e)−Gext,(e)=0, whereGint,(e)is the virtual work of the internal forces, andGext,(e)is the virtual work of the external forces:(29)Gint,(e)=∫0L(e)δεNdx+∫0L(e)δκMbeamdx=∫0L(e)δdTBVK,Tσdx+∫0L(e)δα[(G¯+δxd)Mbeam+BuαN]dxwhereNis the axial force,Mbeamis the bending moment, and the following notation is used:(30)δd={δuT,δvT,δθT}T,BVK={BuBuvBuθ0BvBθ},σ={N,Mbeam}TBy introducing the notationGext,(e)=δdTfext,(e)and(31)fint,(e)=∫0L(e)BVK,Tσdx,h(e)=∫0L(e)[(G¯+δxd)Mbeam+BuαN]dxthe element virtual work equation can be written as(32)Gint,(e)−Gext,(e)=δdT(fint,(e)−fext,(e))︸=0+δαh(e)︸=0=0for any admissibleδdandδα.

Those equations are then appropriately assembled to enforce the equilibrium at each node of the finite element mesh and also at each element. One gets the following two sets of equations:(34)Ae=1Nel(fint,(e)−fext,(e))=0∀e:h(e)=0whereAis the finite element assembly operator. The former set of equations requires equilibrium at each node of the mesh. The latter set of equations requires for each element a weak equilibrium between the moment at the discontinuitytMand the momentMbeamand the axial forceNin the bulk. The unknowns of each element are: the nodal parametersd={uT,vT,θT}T, the rotation jumpα, and the internal variables of inelastic constitutive model. The rotation jump enables introduction of the softening plastic hinge that can be located either at one of the both ends or at the middle of the finite element axis.The implementation and the computational issues, related to the above described element, will be omitted in what follows. We mention that no static condensation ofαis performed; thus, the element has the stiffness matrix of (7×7). This is a major difference between the here used element and the one presented in [14]. Recall that the momentsMbeamandtMare obtained by using inelastic constitutive relations, briefly discussed in Section 2.2. Note that only the bounded part ofκ, i.e.κ¯(see (24)), should be used for evaluation ofMbeam. The axial response of the beam is assumed as elastic.In order to assess how the derived beam finite element can capture geometrically nonlinear effects, some elastic examples are presented in this section. The results shown below indicate that for moderate displacements the derived finite element provides results that are reasonably close to more exact solutions. Note that for pure bending problems, the derived finite element provides geometrically linear results.The first example is presented inFig. 14 (see e.g. [23]). The column is discretized with 8 elements of equal length. The beam is discretized with 2 equal length elements on the left toPand 6 equal length elements on the right toP.Fig. 15 shows the displacementuas a function of forceP. It can be seen that the von-Karman-type of geometrical nonlinearity (“beam FE”) is reasonable close to the solution of [23] up tou≈15cm.The second example is the toggle frame fromFig. 16 (see e.g. [41]). Each beam is discretized with 7 elements of equal length. The displacementuis plotted versus the applied forcePinFig. 17 for clamped and pinned supports. It can be seen that for the pre-peak displacements the von-Karman-type of geometrical nonlinearity (“beam FE”) is reasonable close to the solution of [40] for clamped supports and to the geometrically nonlinear truss solution (“Analytical”) for pinned supports.We can thus conclude that the applied von Karman geometrical nonlinearity can capture reasonable well the global geometrically nonlinear effects for moderate displacements.We performed shell computations, described in Section 2.1, for two hot rolled profiles, the HEA340 and the HEB300 (seeTable 1 andFig. 18). We analyzed a corresponding RPFM under different levels of the end-forceN(seeTable 2); negative values ofNrelate to compressive axial forces. The results were computed by the arc-length method of Riks [28] as implemented in the standard version of Abaqus [1]. It can be seen fromFigs. 19–21 and Fig. 24 that the computer code was not able to perform failure analyses down toM=0. Convergence was lost before reachingM=0in all the considered cases except one. The final value of the plastic workEWp,ref(N)was read at the last converged configuration; this is equal to an assumption that the RPFM elastically unloads toM=0from the last converged configuration. As a consequence, the values ofE¯¯Wp,ref(N)are not accurate. However, the values ofE¯Wp,ref(N)are not affected by the lack of convergence.Shell computations for HEA340 profile were performed for three different reference lengthsLreflisted inTable 3, whereH=350mm≈h(see Table 1). Curves representing the applied end-moment versus the end-rotation are shown in Figs. 19–21. A dot on each curve defines a position where the ultimate applied end-momentMuref(N)was read. The ultimate moment of the most stressed cross-sectionMuref′(N)slightly differs fromMuref(N)(see Fig. 4), and can be calculated by using (2). The almost linear plastic work versus end-rotation curves are presented forLref=L2inFig. 22. The results of the shell computations,Muref(N),Muref′(N),E¯Wp,ref(N)andE¯¯Wp,ref(N), are listed inTable 4 in Appendix, together with the hardening and the softening parameters of the beam material model,Kh(N)andKs(N), respectively, calculated with (13) and (15).Fig. 23 shows how the length of the RPFM (Table 3) influencesMuref′(the longerLref, the lowerMuref′);Mpl=Wplσy, whereWplis the plastic modulus of the cross-section.The final converged configurations for different analyses are presented in Appendix in Fig. 54. The shell computations for the HEB300 profile were performed only for reference lengthL2; hereH=300mm=h. Results are shown inFig. 24, where the ultimate end-momentMuref(N)is marked with a dot. They are also listed inTable 5 in Appendix; the parameters for the beam elasto-plastic material model were calculated by (13) and (15).Figs. 25–27 present curves that might be used as an approximation of results of shell computations;Mu=Muref′for the “shell M´” dots, andMu=Mureffor the “shell M” dots. Fig. 25 (left) indicates that for HEA340 them(N)=Mu(N)/Mplcurve forLref=L1differs approximately 10% from the correspondingm(N)curve forLref=L2. This ratio is also used in Fig. 25 (right) in order to suggest an approximationm(N)curve forLref=L1for HEB300.There are several ways, apart from shell computations, to obtain ultimate capacity curve for a beam cross-section. One can use physical experiments. Strength of material-type calculations can be also used (e.g. [24]), but the effects of plastic hardening, geometric nonlinearity, local buckling, and strain localization are neglected in such calculations. Finally, suggestions from EC3 [17] can be applied. InFig. 28, shell computations for HEA340 and HEB300 for a reference lengthLref=L2are compared to EC3 curves recommended by Eurocode 3 [17] (Section 6.2.9.1, Eqs. (6.31)–(6.38)), and to EM1 curves derived by using elementary strength of material calculations presented inFig. 29. It can be seen that the EC3 curve is very close to the EM1 curve. On the other hand, the shell computations do not coincide with those curves.In this section, we illustrate the above presented weak coupling concept by numerical examples. The shell computations were performed by Abaqus [1]. The above presented beam finite element was implemented into a finite element code AceFEM [22], which was used for beam computations. The analyzed frames consist of HEA340 and HEB300 profiles (Table 6). The following finite elements models were used:(a)The “beam model”, also denoted as BM, described in Section 3.2. The material parameters used are those calculated forLref=L2. The yield momentMyis obtained with (11). The ultimate moment is (see Fig. 25)(35)MuHEA340(N)={Wplσy1.06(1−(|N|Aσy)1.2),N≤0Wplσy1.06,N>0(36)MuHEB300(N)={Wplσy1.08(1−(|N|Aσy)1.35),N≤0Wplσy1.08,N>0The hardening modulus is (in Nmm2) (see Fig. 26 (left) and Fig. 27 (left)):(37)KhHEA340(n)={4.8×1011,n≤02.6×1012n+4.8×1011,0<n≤0.2−17.5×1011n+1.35×1012,0.2<n≤0.63.0×1011,n>0.6(38)KhHEB300(n)={4.3×1011,n≤01.82×1012n+4.3×1011,0<n≤0.2−13.5×1011n+10.7×1011,0.2<n≤0.62.6×1011,n>0.6wheren=−N/Aσy. The softening modulus isKs=−2×109Nmm (for both HEA340 and HEB300).Remark 5At a particular integration point, the values ofMuandKhare defined (and kept fixed during the analysis) when the bending moment at that point first exceeds the yielding momentMyin (11); the correspondingNis used in (35)–(38).Failure curves from Fig. 25 were obtained for the compressive axial forceN. Shell computations on RPFM (see Fig. 23) suggest that the complete failure curve is not symmetric acrossn=0axis. Nevertheless, this was not taken into account in the numerical examples.The “beam model2”, also denoted as BM2, is the embedded-discontinuity beam finite element (not described in detail in this work) that uses the two-curve yield criterion (16). The mayor difference between the BM and the BM2 is in implementation of the stress-resultant elasto-plasticity with hardening. We choose to define the hardening modulus of the BM2 as(39)K^h=[Kh/(My)2]n=0IfLref=L2is taken into consideration, functionsMu(N)are defined by (35) and (36). According to (39),K^hHEA340=3.4×10−6N−1andK^hHEB300=3.0×10−6N−1. The softening moduli areKsHEA340=KsHEB300=−2×109Nmm. IfLref=L1is taken into consideration, functionsMu(N)are taken from Fig. 25 (see curves denoted as1.1m(n)). According to (39),K^hHEA340=4.2×10−6N−1,K^hHEB300=3.6×10−6N−1. The softening moduli areKsHEA340=KsHEB300=−2.9×109Nmm.In order to be able to make a comparison of the results of the weak coupling procedure with more accurate results, the entire frames are analyzed with shell finite elements [1]; this is called the “shell model”, also denoted as SM. The middle axes of a frame discretized by the beam elements correspond to the middle axes of a frame discretized by the shell elements. Each shell mesh consists of square elements with edge length of≈2cm. The assumed steel quality is S235 [17]: the elastic modulusE=21,000kN/cm2, Poisson׳s ratioν=0.3, the yield stressσy=23.5kN/cm2, the nominal ultimate stressσu=36kN/cm2, the nominal ultimate strainεu=0.2, the fracture energy per unit areags=3.57kN/cm, the softening moduliKsofle=−362.7kN/cm2, andKsofle,⁎=−528.6kN/cm2. If nominal yield stress versus nominal plastic strain uniaxial curve is used as an input data, it is called “shell model (nominal)”. If logarithmic yield stress versus logarithmic plastic strain uniaxial curve is used as an input data, it is called “shell model (true)”.Two different types of analysis were performed: (i) elastic geometrically nonlinear (EGNL) and (ii) elasto-plastic geometrically nonlinear (EPGNL). For EGNL, the above mentioned finite element models were used with simple elastic constitutive relations.We repeat analyses from Section 4.1 with the beam model. Three examples (N=0,N=−0.1Ny,N=−0.4Ny) are computed forLref=L2(Table 2). The mesh consists of 10 beam finite elements per the cantilever beam of lengthLref/2. The follower nature of the end-force is taken into account. The applied end-momentMversus the end-rotationφcurves are presented inFigs. 30–32. It can be clearly seen that the application of the weak coupling procedure produces trilinear beam modelM−φcurves, while the shell modelM−φcurves are smooth. The ultimate moments of both models are very similar. This is not necessary true for the corresponding rotations, which are bigger for the beam model. Figs. 31 and 32 show that for the BM2 the yielding starts later in comparison with the BM. Thus, the hardening part of the BM2 response is shorter; for HEA340 andN=−0.4Nythere is no hardening response at all.We consider portal frame [37] subjected to two vertical loads and one horizontal load as illustrated inFig. 33. The vertical loads are constant,λ2=1,P=2800kN, while the horizontal load is a linear function of a load factorλ1=λ. For the beam models, the mesh consists of five finite elements per structural member. The beam–column connections in the shell model are rigid due to coupled degrees of freedom of the corresponding cross-sections; the out-of-plane instability of the frame is prevented. The beam models data was forLref=L2.The load factorλversusuhorcurves are presented inFigs. 34 and 36. For EGNL analysis, the beam and the shell results are the same up touhor≈800mm; after that the SM gives a lower response curve: the difference can be attributed to a local buckling (Fig. 35) that cannot be captured by the beam elastic analysis. For EPGNL analysis (Fig. 36) the maximum load factorλof the BM2 (λ=1.72) and the SM (λ=1.70) are very close; it is much lower for the BM (around 75% of the SM). In all cases, the maximumλis reached at a very small horizontal displacementuhoras a consequence of a large vertical loadP.In the BM analysis, the softening plastic hinges do not appear at all. The material softening is not predicted by the SM either. In the BM2 analysis, the softening plastic hinges appear but the hardening plasticity is not activated. The reason for that is that a failure curve (35) or (36) is lower than the yielding curve (16) at a higher level of the axial force (as illustrated inFig. 37), thus the critical cross-section failure (due to local buckling) starts before its yielding. The plastic work for the BM is done only due to material hardening, and the plastic work for the BM2 is done only due to material softening. This results in different post limit point curves in Fig. 36 and different shapes of deformed configurations shown inFig. 38.This example differs from the previous one (Fig. 33) only in a vertical loading. The fixed value of a vertical force is lowered to 500kN (Fig. 33), andλ1=λ2=λ; all other data rest the same (Fig. 39). The example calls for a usage of an arc-length method; we used the one presented in [35].Figs. 40 and Fig. 42 show the results. For EGNL analysis, there is hardly any difference between the beam and the shell results beforeuhor≈700mm; after that the SM gives lower response curve, which can be attributed to a local buckling (Fig. 41). Nevertheless, the von Karman beam geometrical nonlinearity fits nicely with the exact geometrically nonlinear formulation of the SM up to an appearance of a local buckling in the SM. For EPGNL analysis (Fig. 42) the limit load factor λ of the BM2 (λ=4.20) and the SM (λ=4.08) are close; it is lower for the BM. With respect to the 1st portal frame example, a difference in computed limit loads is smaller due to a lower level of vertical load; also, theuhorat maximum λ is about two times larger comparing to the 1st portal frame example.The BM reaches the limit load before activation of any softening plastic hinge. No softening is observed either in the SM results. On the other hand, the BM2 activates softening plastic hinges without appearance of the hardening plasticity (see Fig. 42) and the 1st portal frame example for an explanation for that. The post limit point responses of the BM and the BM2 differ from the SM, as shown in Fig. 42. Deformed configurations are shown inFig. 43.Fig. 44 illustrates locations of the softening plastic hinges predicted by the BM2.We analyze a 4-story frame illustrated inFig. 45:F0=50kN,qv=0.05kN/cm,LB=500cmandHC=250cm. The frame is composed of HEB300 columns and HEA340 beams. The mesh for beam models consists of 8 elements per a column and 16 elements per a beam; the mesh for shell models consists of square elements with edge length of≈20mm.The load factor λ versusuhorcurves are presented inFigs. 46 and 47. For EGNL analysis (Fig. 46), the beam and the shell results are the same up touhor≈1200mm. After that the shell model gives a lower response curve due to a local buckling that cannot be captured by the elastic beam models. Several beam models are used for EPGNL analysis (Fig. 47): besides BM≡BM(L2) and BM2≡BM2(L2) (already used in previous examples), we consider BM2(L1), and BM2(L1) withMy0=1.12Wσy=1.12My(0). Among those models, the latter two provide the results that are closest to the SM results. However, each beam curve differs from the shell curves after a corresponding beam curve limit point (see Fig. 47). The plastic work done by the BM and the BM2 models is very similar (seeFig. 48); these two beam models predict slightly lower plastic work than the shell model (seeFig. 49). The deformed configurations are shown inFig. 50; it can be seen that the SM and the BM2 predict similar failure modes. It can be seen fromFigs. 51 and 52 that the BM2 predicts column softening hinges one story higher than the BM. Accumulation of plastic deformations in the SM is illustrated inFig. 53.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A weak coupling concept for steel frame failure analysis has been studied in detail in this work. The following can be concluded:(i)The length of a representative part of a frame member,Lref, which is used to perform the shell computations, is of relative importance. The results of the computed examples suggest that the following recommendation can be made:Lrefshould preferably equal twice the height of a cross-section. However,Lrefcan be also larger; a length up to e.g. four times the height of a cross-section is acceptable.The consistent incorporation of the results of the shell computations into the beam finite element formulation can be done nicely (within the framework of the weak coupling concept) by equating either the plastic works or the plastic dissipations of the beam and the shell models for a representative part of a frame member. In such a way, an ad-hock tuning of the beam moment–curvature and moment–rotation relations in order to comply with the results of shell computations can be avoided.The von-Karman-type geometrical nonlinearity, applied in a beam model, can successfully approximate the global geometrically nonlinear effects of a frame structure. Of course, the larger are the deformations, the worse are the approximations. However, the computed examples show that for moderate displacements, the von-Karman strains work fine with respect to a more exact nonlinear strain formulation.The choice of the cross-section yield criterion has a considerable influence on the results of the beam models. If a simple first-fiber-yield criterion is used, the results are more conservative (with respect to a refined shell finite element analysis of a complete frame) compared to the two-curve yield criterion. The difference is more pronounced for a higher level of the axial force as illustrated by the portal frame examples.A comparison of results of the shell computations (within the framework of the weak coupling concept) with some other engineering approaches that can be used to obtain the moment–curvature relation for a beam cross-section show that other approaches are more conservative. The reason is that they are practically all based on the strength of material calculations. In such a way, they neglect the effects of plastic hardening, geometric nonlinearity, local buckling, and strain localization, which are all taken into account in shell computations in the framework of the weak coupling concept.Numerical examples show that the presented weak coupling concept can predict the limit load and the limit ductility of a steel frame nicely and relatively accurately. These predictions are on one hand conservative (i.e. on the safe side) and on the other hand more realistic from those using a predefined moment–curvature relation for a beam cross-section obtained by other widely used engineering approaches. A steel frame failure mode can be also predicted nicely with the presented weak coupling concept. The softening plastic hinges pop up automatically during an analysis. Numerical examples also illustrate that a prediction of post-limit-point response of a steel frame with the presented weak coupling concept may not be very accurate.In conclusion, the studied weak coupling concept for steel frame failure analysis has a great potential to be successfully used for practical applications.
