@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Although investment projects supported by the state are extremely important in terms of national policy the projects to be transferred from the common public funds brings with it many problems. Highly transparent and comprehensive evaluation model are required to transfer the public resources to the right investment projects. It is necessary to consider many criteria for the evaluation of an investment project. These criteria are generally subjective and extremely difficult to express in numbers. However, using the fuzzy sets provide huge facilities to decision makers in project evaluation process with linguistic variables and measurement challenges. In this study, a new evaluation model for investment projects have been proposed for development agencies operating in Turkey. To address ambiguities and relativities in real world scenarios more conveniently, type-2 fuzzy sets and crisp sets have been simultaneously used. The proposed model for the investment project evaluation problem composed of type-2 fuzzy AHP and type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS methods. The proposed fuzzy MCDM method consists of three phases: (1) identify the criteria to be used in the model, (2) type-2 fuzzy AHP computations, (3) evaluation of investment projects with type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS and determination of the final rank. To perceive proposed model better, an application with real case data have been performed in Middle Black Sea Development Agency in Turkey. As a consequence of this application, it has been observed that the proposed model have proved effective in evaluation of alternatives in multi-criteria group decision making problems in a broader perspective and flexible fashion.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Importance of the investment projects carried out by the private sector cannot be ignored for sustainable socio-economic development of countries in the globalizing world. Having a limiting financial resource causes a finance problem so as that private sector realizes the investment projects. In the case of high finance costs, state financially supports private sector to be able realize strategically significant investment projects. Companies continuously make investments for many reasons such as capacity building and technological innovation. Often, there are several alternatives that fit for the purpose of the investment. Among these alternatives, the best option must be chosen for the company. In recent years, many states provide direct financial support to private sector investments in increasing proportions. States promote private sector investments for many reasons such as economic, politic and social. One of the most critical issues of public support is to determine that which projects will be supported. Some of the expected outcomes of the projects with public support are employment increase, prevention of environment damage, national income growth and competitiveness increase. From this point, the answer to the question of which projects should be financed by public support is to choose projects that maximize the benefit criteria mentioned above with the lowest cost.Even if there are different tools in each country to promote private sector instruments, many countries support investment projects through regional development agencies. Duties of these agencies are as follows [1]:•Providing technical support to the planning activities and duties of local authorities,Supporting the activities and projects ensuring the implementation of regional plan and programs; monitoring and evaluating the implementation process of activities and projects supported within this context and presenting results to the Undersecretariat of State Planning Organization,Contributing to the improvement of the capacity of the region concerning the rural and local development in accordance with the regional plans and programs, and supporting the projects within this extent as well,Monitoring other projects implemented by public sector, private sector and non-governmental organizations in the region and considered as important in terms of regional plan and programs,Improving cooperation between public sector, private sector and non-governmental organizations to achieve regional development objectives,Carrying out research, or having them carried out, concerning the determination of resources and opportunities of the region, acceleration of economic and social development and enhancement of competitiveness, and supporting other research carried out by other persons, organizations and institutions.In this paper, a new multicriteria decision making (MCDM) model based on Type-2 fuzzy sets is proposed to the current project evaluation system of regional development agencies in Turkey. The proposed model is applied on a real case problem by Middle Black Sea Development Agency in Turkey.On the other hand, merely considering the dimension of feasibility is not adequate for decision-making. In order for a project to come to life, numerous motives exist and implementation of the Project has various economic, social and environmental impacts. For this reason, evaluation of projects is indeed an MCDM process. The purpose of MCDM is to choose a best candidate from a set of alternatives by means of evaluating multiple attributes of the alternatives [2]. The intent of MCDM methods is to improve the quality of decisions about investment projects involving multiple criteria by making choices more explicit, rational, and efficient [3].Although economically, evaluation of investment projects are subjectively regarded easy, evaluation of projects on political, social and environmental aspects is complex. Assigning numerical values for evaluation criteria is not always possible. For this reason, in cases where assigning a numerical value is not possible, linguistic variables are used. The fuzzy set theory enables comparison of alternatives by digitizing linguistic variables. A major contribution of fuzzy set theory is its capability of representing vague knowledge. The theory also allows mathematical operators and programming to apply to the fuzzy domain [4].In the process of decision making, the information about attribute values is usually uncertain or fuzzy due to the increasing complexity of the socio-economic environment and the vagueness of inherent subjective nature of human thinking. This fact has led to many authors to apply the fuzzy set theory [5] to model the uncertainty and vagueness in decision processes [6]. Also the fuzzy set theory is used investment decision making problems. Damghani et al. [7] developed a modular decision support system about choosing the optimum investment instrument in uncertain environment. Karsak and Tolga [8] presented a multi criteria decision-making process that includes fuzzy cash flow analysis to use it for the evaluation of advanced manufacturing system investment. Kahraman et al. [9], in an uncertain economic-decision making environment, to execute the investment analysis in fuzzy based; developed formulas for fuzzy present value analysis, fuzzy future value analysis, fuzzy cost-benefit analysis, fuzzy payback period analysis.Unlike the published papers a new MCDM methodology based on type-2 fuzzy sets is improved in this paper by integrating crisp and linguistic evaluation together. There are (at least) four sources of uncertainties in type-1 fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) [10]: (i) The meanings of the words that are used in the antecedents and consequents of rules can be uncertain (words mean different things to different people), (ii) Consequents may have a histogram of values associated with them, especially when knowledge is extracted from a group of experts who do not all agree, (iii) Measurements that activate a type-1 FLS may be noisy and therefore uncertain, (iv) The data that are used to tune the parameters of a type-1 FLS may also be noisy. All of these uncertainties translate into uncertainties about fuzzy set membership functions. Type-1 fuzzy sets are not able to directly model such uncertainties because their membership functions are totally crisp. On the other hand, type-2 fuzzy sets are able to model such uncertainties because their membership functions are themselves fuzzy. Membership functions of type-1 fuzzy sets are two-dimensional, whereas membership functions of type-2 fuzzy sets are three-dimensional. It is the new third-dimension of type-2 fuzzy sets that provides additional degrees of freedom that make it possible to directly model uncertainties. Membership functions of Type-1 fuzzy sets are crisp sets. For this reason, in cases where the meanings of criteria are not clear, the evaluators do not hold the same opinions and the setting of evaluation is noisy, type-1 fuzzy sets cannot offer effective decision support. In such cases, type-2 fuzzy sets whose membership functions are type-1 fuzzy sets too enables convenient modeling of problem. If we can use interval type-2 fuzzy sets [11] for handling fuzzy group decision-making problems, then there is room for more flexibility due to the fact that interval type-2 fuzzy sets are more suitable to represent uncertainties than type-1 fuzzy sets [2]. Type-2 fuzzy sets have been successfully applied in decision making process. Erdogan and Kaya [12], proposed an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology based on type-2 fuzzy sets for selection among energy alternatives. Then they tried to define a roadmap for Turkey. Erdogan and Kaya [13] used a fuzzy MCDM method based on type-2 TOPSIS to rank the private universities in Istanbul. Erdogan and Kaya [14] proposed a multi criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology based on type-2 fuzzy sets to manage qualitative and quantitative criteria with uncertainties for selecting the best alternative fuel bus for public transportation in Istanbul. Wang et al. [6] presented a new method to handle fuzzy group decision making (GDM) problems based on the ranking values and the arithmetic operations of interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FSs) and used an example to illustrate the fuzzy GDM process of the proposed method. Wu and Mendel [15] presented a method using the linguistic weighted average and IT2 FSs for handling fuzzy multiple criteria hierarchical GDM problems, Wu and Mendel's fuzzy multiple criteria hierarchical GDM method was to make decisions by means of aggregating the opinions of DMs. Chen and Lee [2] presented an IT2 fuzzy TOPSIS method to handle fuzzy MAGDM problems based on IT2 FSs, and used some examples to illustrate the fuzzy MADM process of the proposed method. Chen and Lee [16] also presented a new method to handle fuzzy MAGDM problems based on the ranking values and the arithmetic operations of IT2 FSs.In this study, as in many decision making problems, the multi criteria decision making technique is used. Although there are a lot of decision support models in literature, in our study, AHP and TOPSIS methods based on type-2 fuzzy sets due to nature of problem which is subject of our study. Besides, in the model, we used the fuzzy sets and crisp sets at the same time because some evaluation criteria were fuzzy and assessors didn’t specify a definite value for some criteria. The proposed model for the investment project evaluation problem, composed of type-2 fuzzy AHP and type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS methods, consists of three phases. In the first phase, the criteria which will be used in project evaluation are determined and the decision hierarchy is formed. In the second phase, criteria used in selection projects are assigned weights using type-2 fuzzy AHP. Project ranks are determined by using type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method in the third phase.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, interval type-2 fuzzy sets are briefly introduced. In Section 3, type-2 fuzzy AHP method is briefly reviewed. Type-2 fuzzy TOPSİS method is summarized in Section 4. The proposed decision making methodology based on type-2 fuzzy sets is detailed in Section 5. A real case application related with evolution of investment project for a development agency is analyzed in Section 6. The conclusions and future research directions are discussed in Section 7.In comparison to a classical fuzzy set that named type-1 fuzzy sets and has membership function that is crisp, a type-2 fuzzy set has membership functions that are themselves fuzzy [17]. Type-2 fuzzy sets provide a measure of dispersion to better capture inherent uncertainties, which becomes especially useful in problems where it is difficult to determine the exact membership function for a fuzzy set [18]. As a result, we can say that type-2 fuzzy sets are more capable than ordinary fuzzy sets in dealing with problems includes judgments that are more subjective and more imprecise. Since, general type-2 fuzzy sets are computationally intensive, interval type-2 fuzzy sets more used into applications. In this section, the basic concepts and operations of interval type-2 fuzzy sets are introduced below [2,6,11,16,19,20]:Definition 2.1A type-2 fuzzy setA≈in the universe of discourse X can be represented by a type-2 membership functionμA≈, shown as follows:(1)A≈={((x,u),μA≈(x,u))|∀x∈X,∀u∈Jx⊆[0,1],0≤μA≈(x,u)≤1}where Jxdenotes an interval in [0, 1]. Moreover, the type-2 fuzzy setA≈also can be represented as follows:(2)A≈=∫x∈X∫u∈JxμA≈(x,u)(x,u)where Jx⊆[0, 1] and ∫∫ denotes union over all admissible x and u.LetA≈be a type-2 fuzzy set in the universe of discourse X represented by the type-2 membership functionμA≈. If allμA≈(x,u)=1, thenA≈is called an interval type-2fuzzy set. An interval type-2 fuzzy setA≈can be regarded as a special case of a type-2 fuzzy set, represented as follows:(3)A≈=∫x∈X∫u∈Jx1(x,u)where Jx⊆[0, 1]A trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy set is shown in Fig. 1where the upper membership function and the lower membership function of an interval type-2 fuzzy set are type-1 membership functions, respectively. The footprint of uncertainty (FOU) is shown as the shaded region. It is bounded by an upper membership function (UMF) and a lower membership function (LMF), both of which aretype-1 fuzzy sets.In this subsection, the main operations on type-2 fuzzy sets are introduced [2,6,11,16,19,20]:Definition 2.3The addition operation between the trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy setA≈1=(A˜1U,A˜1L)=((a11U,a12U,a13U,a14U,;H1(A˜1U),H2(A˜1U)),(a11L,a12L,a14L,a14L,;H1(A˜1L),H2(A˜1L)))andA≈2=(A˜2U,A˜2L)=((a21U,a22U,a23U,a24U,;H1(A˜2U),H2(A˜2U)),(a21L,a22L,a23L,a24L,;H1(A˜2L),H2(A˜2L)))is defined as follows:(4)A≈1⊕A≈2=(A˜1U,A˜1L)⊕(A˜2U,A˜2L)=((((a11U+a21U,a12U+a22U,a13U+a23U,a14U+a24U;min(H1(A˜1U),H1(A˜2U)),min(H2(A˜1U),H2(A˜2U))),(a11L+a21L,a12L+a22L,a13L+a23L,a14L+a24L;min(H1(A˜1L),H1(A˜2L)),min(H2(A˜1L),H2(A˜2L))).The multiplication operation between the trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy setsA≈1=(A˜1U,A˜1L)=((a11U,a12U,a13U,a14U,;H1(A˜1U),H2(A˜1U)),(a11L,a12L,a13L,a14L,;H1(A˜1L),H2(A˜1L)))andA≈2=(A˜2U,A˜2L)=((a21U,a22U,a23U,a24U,;H1(A˜2U),H2(A˜2U)),(a21L,a22L,a23L,a24L,;H1(A˜2L),H2(A˜2L)))is defined as follows:(5)A≈1⊗A≈2=(A˜1U,A˜1L)⊗(A˜2U,A˜2L)=((((a11U×a21U,a12U×a22U,a13U×a23U,a14U×a24U;min(H1(A˜1U),H1(A˜2U)),min(H2(A˜1U),H2(A˜2U))),(a11L×a21L,a12L×a22L,a13L×a23L,a14L×a24L;min(H1(A˜1L),H1(A˜2L)),min(H2(A˜1L),H2(A˜2L))).The arithmetic operations between the trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy setsA≈1=(A˜1U,A˜1L)=((a11U,a12U,a13U,a14U,;H1(A˜1U),H2(A˜1U)),(a11L,a12L,a13L,a14L,;H1(A˜1L),H2(A˜1L)))and the crisp value k is defined as follows:(6)kxA≈1=((k×a11U,k×a12U,k×a13U,k×a14U;H1(A˜1U),H2(A˜1U)),((k×a11L,k×a12L,k×a13L,k×a14L;H1(A˜1L),H2(A˜1L))AHP is a structured approach to decision making developed by Saaty [21]. It is a weighted factor-scoring model and has the ability to detect and incorporate inconsistencies inherent in the decision making process [22]. In a typical AHP method, experts have to give a definite number within a 1–9 scale to the pair-wise comparison so that the priority vector can be computed. However, factor comparisons often involve some amount of uncertainty and subjectivity. For example, an expert may know one factor is more important than another; however, the expert cannot give a definite scale to the comparison because the expert is not sure about the degree of one factor over another. Sometimes, experts cannot compare two factors due to the lack of adequate information [4]. In this case, type-2 fuzzy sets that provide a mathematical strength to capture the uncertainties associated with human cognitive process can be used. The steps of type-2 AHP method are:Step 1: Construct the type-2 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix Akof the kth decision-maker and construct the average decision matrixA¯. Each element of the pairwise comparison matrix is an interval type-2 fuzzy set, representing which is the more important of two criteria. The pairwise comparison matrix shown as follows:(7)Ak=(aijk∼)n×n=1a12k≈…a1nk≈a21k≈1…a2nk≈⋮⋮⋮⋮an1k≈an2k≈…1=1a12k≈…a1nk≈1/a12k≈1…a2nk≈⋮⋮⋮⋮1/a1nk≈1/a2nk≈…1(8)A¯=(a¯ij≈)n×n,The geometric mean of k type-2 fuzzy sets is calculated as follows:(9)a¯ij≈=aij1≈⊗aij2≈⊗…⊗aijk≈1/k=aij1≈⊗aij2≈⊗…⊗aijk≈kwhereaij≈n=aij1Un,aij2Un,aij3Un,aij4Un;H1U(aij),H2U(aij),aij1Ln,aij2Ln,aij3Ln,aij4Ln;H1L(aij),H2L(aij)For the evaluation procedure, the linguistic terms given in Table 1are used. The geometric mean is used to aggregate expert opinions.Step 2: Examine the consistency of the fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. Assume A=[aij] is a positive reciprocal matrix andA≈=[aij≈]is a fuzzy positive reciprocal matrix. If the result of the comparisons of A=[aij] is consistent, then it can imply that the result of the comparisons ofA≈=[aij≈]is also consistent [23].Step 3: Compute the fuzzy geometric mean for each criterion. The geometric mean of each row ofA≈=[aij≈]is calculated as:(10)ri≈=Ai1≈⊗Ai2≈⊗…⊗Ain≈nStep 4: Compute the weights of the criteria by normalization. The tyepe-2 fuzzy weight of the ith criterion is calculated as:(11)wi≈=ri≈⊗ri≈⊕ri≈⊕…⊕rn≈−1Step 5: Defuzzify the type-2 fuzzy weights of the criteria. In this study, the center of area (COA) method is utilized to defuzzify the upper and lower membership values of type-2 fuzzy numbers into best nonfuzzy performance (BNP) value. The BNP value can be calculated as:(12)wj∼=∫xu(x)dx∫u(x)dx=−wj1×wj2+wj3×wj4+1/3(wj4−wj3)2−1/3(wj2−wj1)2−wj1−wj2+wj3+wj4That the fuzzy numbers we used are symmetrical enabled us to use arithmetical mean of upper bound and lower bound in defuzzification of type2 fuzzy numbers.As the number of alternatives increase in type-2 fuzzy AHP method, a great deal of pairwise comparison and calculation are required. Although that there exist plenty of comparisons pose certain difficulties for decision makers, this also reduces the effectiveness of comparisons. Therefore, type-2 fuzzy TOPSİS method has been used in the process of evaluation of projects by the criteria specified.In Chen and Lee's [2] type 2 fuzzy TOPSIS methodology, only type-2 fuzzy sets were used. But, in real world situations, in majority of multi-criteria decision-making problems, crisp numbers and fuzzy sets should be used concurrently. In this project where investment projects are appraised, type-2 fuzzy sets are used for some criteria during evaluation while for some criteria crisp numbers are used during evaluation phase due to their nature. Apart from this, due to the variety of evaluation criteria, the units of numbers in decision matrix are different. In such nonhomogenous cases, normalization is necessary for calculation. For this reason, differently from Chen and Lee's [2], we have included normalization step in our study. In addition to this, in our study we used defuzzified numbers in steps of ranking values.Assume that there is a set P of alternatives, where P={p1, p2, …, pn} and assume that there is a set A of attributes, where A={a1, a2, …, am}. Assume that there are q decision-makers DM1, DM2, …, and DMq. The set A of attributes can be divided into two sets A1 and A2, where A1 denotes the set of benefit attributes, A2 denotes the set of cost attributes A1∩A2=∅ and A1∪A2=A. The details of proposed method are presented as follows:Step 1: Construct the decision matrix Dkof the kth decision-maker and construct the average decision matrixD¯, respectively, shown as follows:(13)Dk=(aijk∼)m×n=a1a2⋮ama11k≈a12k≈…a1nk≈a21k≈a22k≈…a2nk≈⋮⋮⋮⋮am1k≈am2k≈…amnk≈(14)D¯=(aijk≈)m×n,whereaij≈=((aij1≈⊕aij2≈⊕…⊕aijk≈)/q),aij≈is an interval type-2 fuzzy set or crisp number, 1≤i≤m, 1≤j≤n, 1≤k≤q k denotes the number of decision-makers.Step 2: The decision matrix defuzzified by using Center of Area (COA) method Eq. (11).Step 3: The defuzzified decision matrixD*_is normalized by using Eq. (18).(18)rij=rijri+,ai∈A1ri−rij,ai∈A2where A1 denotes the set of benefit criteria, A2 denotes the set of cost criteria, and 1≤i≤m.Step 4: Weighted normalized decision matrix is obtained by multiplying normalized matrix with the weights of the criteria:(19)vij=wi×rijwhere, 1≤i≤m, 1≤j≤n.Step 5: Positive ideal solutionv+=(v1+,v2+,…vm+)and the negative-ideal solutionv−=(v1−,v2−,…vm−)are determined as:(20)vi+=max1≤j≤nvjifai∈A2min1≤j≤nvjifai∈A1and(21)vi−=max1≤j≤nvjifai∈A1min1≤j≤nvjifai∈A2where A1 denotes the set of benefit attributes, A2 denotes the set of cost attributes, and 1≤i≤m.Step 6: The distance of each alternative from positive ideal solutionv+and negative-ideal solutionv−is calculated as:(22)d+(pj)=∑i=1m(vij−vi+)2,(23)d−(pj)=∑i=1m(vij−vi−)2,where 1≤j≤n.Step 7: The closeness coefficient of each alternative C(pj) is calculated as:(24)C(pj)=d−(pj)d+(pj)+d−(pj),where 1≤j≤n.Step 8: Sort the values of C(pj) in a descending sequence, where 1≤j≤n. The larger the value of C(pj), the higher the preference of the alternative pj, where 1≤j≤n.When the above mentioned steps are examined, apart from the studies in literature, the model allows usage of crisp numbers other than type-2 fuzzy numbers. Therefore, while linguistic variables are used for criteria where assigning value is too difficult, for other criteria, crisp numbers are used. This case makes adaptation of the model to real world problems more convenient.The proposed model for the investment project evaluation problem, composed of type-2 fuzzy AHP and type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS methods, consists of three phases: (1) identify the criteria to be used in the model, (2) type-2 fuzzy AHP computations, (3) evaluation of investment projects with type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS and determination of the final rank. A flowchart of the proposed model for evaluating investment projects is shown in Fig. 2. In the first phase, the criteria which will be used in project evaluation are determined and the decision hierarchy is formed. After that, the decision hierarchy is approved by decision-making team. In the second phase, criteria used in selection projects are assigned weights using type-2 fuzzy AHP. In this phase, pairwise comparison matrixes are formed by using linguistic variables, to determine the criteria weights. The experts from decision-making team make individual evaluations using the scale provided in Table 1, to determine the values of the elements of pairwise comparison matrixes. Computing the geometric mean of the values obtained from individual evaluations, a final pairwise comparison matrix is found. After checking the consistency of comparison matrix, the type-2 fuzzy weights of the criteria are calculated. In the last step of second phase, type-2 fuzzy weights are defuzzified by using center of area (COA) method. Project ranks are determined by using type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method in the third phase. For evaluating the investment projects, linguistic variables in Table 2and crisp numbers are simultaneously used. Before normalization step, the type-2 fuzzy decision matrix is defuzzified. Ranking of the project is determined according to closeness coefficient value in descending order schematic.In this study, a new evaluation model for investment projects have been proposed for development agencies operating in Turkey. For this aim, a new MCDM methodology based on type-2 fuzzy sets is proposed by integrating crisp and linguistic evaluation together. This methodology brings some advantages such as more flexibility and sensitiveness to evaluate criteria and alternatives in project management. To address ambiguities and relativities in project evaluation cases more conveniently, type-2 fuzzy sets and crisp sets have been simultaneously used. The proposed methodology allows to define their evaluations by using not only crisp numbers but also linguistic variables. The proposed fuzzy methodology also facilitates decision makers to make more consistent and rational evaluations of criteria and project alternatives.Using the both crisp sets and type-2 fuzzy sets methods in the same evaluation model is superior compared to the models used in the previous studies. To perceive proposed model better, an application with real case data have been performed in Middle Black Sea Development Agency in Turkey.Middle Black Sea Development Agency (OKA) has been established by the decision of the Council of Ministers on November 10th, 2008 in order to support economic, social and cultural development of four cities located in the Middle Black Sea Region of Turkey. These cities are Samsun, Amasya, Tokat, and Çorum, among which Samsun has been chosen as the center of the Agency as shown in Fig. 3. OKA is one of the regional development agencies which have been founded by the Turkish Government throughout the whole country in the NUTS-2 regions to coordinate regional development, to introduce strategies to enable regions to use their capacities to the maximum benefit of the region, to supply the region with the means to improve their competitiveness and reduce the imbalance existing within and between the regions. Objectives of the Agency are to improve the cooperation between public sector, private sector and NGOs and to promote the effective and efficient use of the resources in order to accelerate the sustainability of the regional development by evoking the local potential [1].Since the budget activated for support is not sufficient for supporting all investment projects, the Agency needs to be able to use its resources in the most efficient and effective way possible. For this reason, determination of which projects should be supported is a greatly significant decision-making problem.In application phase, 5 alternative projects p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 with distinct features chosen among the applications submitted under the Financial Support Program of Increasing Competitiveness of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and Improving Foreign Trade run by OKA have been assessed using linguistic variables in Table 2 and crisp sets by 3 agency specialists DM1, DM2, DM3 that are considered as expert.Similar studies in literature, similar organizations providing financial support and evaluation criteria used by banks that offer investment credit have been examined. Next, the criteria have been finalized following the meetings with OKA staff, experts and from literature review. In this study, 28 criteria have been utilized to evaluate investment projects as follows:• Sectoral (C1)i.Sectoral priority (c11)Clustering (c12)Complementary investment (c13)Technology transfer (c14)Multiplier effect (c15)Cooperation (c16)• Economic (C2)vii.Co-financing rate (c21)Payback period (c22)Demand size (c23)Patent and trademark creating (c24)Increasing competitiveness (c25)• Institutional (C3)i.Total experience (c31)Investment-related experience (c32)Project experience (c33)Asset size (c34)Net profit/asset size (c35)Facility infrastructure (c36)Institutional capacity (c37)• Social/sustainable (C4)i.Environmental impact (c41)Number of employment (c42)Number of handicapped employment (c43)Occupational health and safety (c44)• Political (C5)i.Current account deficit reduction (c51)Investments in R&D and energy efficiency (c52)Innovation investments (c53)Organized industrial zone and rural areas investment (c54)Visibility (c55)Reducing the development gap (c56)Decision makers have used crisp number without any scale for evaluation criteria of c21, c22, c31, c32, c33, c34, c35, c42 and c43 however, they have used type-2 fuzzy set for the rest of the evaluation criteria. The hierarchical structure of the project evaluation model is shown in Fig. 4.The three decision-makers DM1, DM2, and DM3 use the linguistic terms shown in Table 2 to represent the evaluating values of the alternatives with respect to different criteria, as shown in Table 3.Based on Eq. (11), the defuzzified values of the interval type-2 fuzzy set can be calculated, as follows:wj∼=∫xu(x)dx∫u(x)dx=−wj1×wj2+wj3×wj4+1/3(wj4−wj3)2−1/3(wj2−wj1)2−wj1−wj2+wj3+wj4c11u=(−0.70×0.90)+(0.90×1.00)+1/3(1.00−0.90)2−1/3(0.90−0.70)2−0.70−0.90+0.90+1.00=0.867c11L=(−0.80×0.90)+(0.90×0.95)+1/3(0.95−0.90)2−1/3(0.90−0.80)2−0.80−0.90+0.90+0.95=0.883c11=c11U+c11L2=0.867+0.8832=0.875In the same way we defuzzified the rest of the decision matrix shown in Table 4before normalization.Type-2 AHP method is used on determination of weights of the project evaluation criteria. The decision makers make their evaluations by using the linguistic terms defined in Table 1. Table 5presents the linguistic variables of the pairwise comparison matrix which are defined by three different experts for the factors.The elements of the pairwise comparison matrices are calculated by using the geometric mean method as follows:aij≈=aij1≈⊗aij2≈⊗…⊗aijk≈kaij≈=((5,6,8,9;1,1)(5.2,6.2,7.8,8.8;0.8,0.8)⊗(3,4,6,7;1,1)(3.2,4.2,5.8,6.8;0.8,0.8)⊗(5,6,8,9;1,1)(5.2,6.2,7.8,8.8;0.8,0.8))1/3=(4.22,5.24,7.27,8.28;1,1)(4.42,5.45,7.07,8.08;0.8,0.8)In the same way we calculate the rest of the pairwise comparison matrix shown in Table 6.According to the type-2 fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix, the type-2 fuzzy weights of criteria are obtained by the following computational procedures:ri≈=Ai1≈⊗Ai2≈⊗…⊗Ain≈nr1≈=((1,1,1,1;1,1)(1,1,1,1;1,1)⊗(4.22,5.24,7.27,8.28;1,1)(4.42,5.45,7.07,8.08;0.8,0.8)⊗(1.44,2.00,2.88,3.27;1,1)(1.57,2.10,2.80,3.20;0.8,0.8)⊗(1.71,2.29,3.17,3.56;1,1)(1.84,2.39,3.09,3.48;0.8,0.8)⊗(1.00,1.59,2.52,2.92;1,1)(1.13,1.69,2.44,2.85;0.8,0.8))1/5=(1.60,2.07,2.79,3.09;1,1)(1.70,2.15,2.72,3.03;0.8,0.8)In the same way we calculate the remainingr1≈as follows:r2≈=(0.68,0.85,1.21,1.50;1,1)(0.72,0.88,1.17,1.43;0.8,0.8)r3≈=(1.18,1.45,1.94,2.24;1,1)(1.24,1.50,1.89,2.17;0.8,0.8)r4≈=(0.31,0.35,0.45,0.56;1,1)(0.32,0.35,0.44,0.53;0.8,0.8)r5≈=(0.44,0.50,0.66,0.82;1,1)(0.45,0.52,0.64,0.78;0.8,0.8)The type-2 fuzzy weights are computed by normalization as follows:wi≈=ri≈⊗ri≈⊕ri≈⊕…⊕rn≈−1w1≈=(1.60,2.07,2.79,3.09;1,1)(1.70,2.15,2.72,3.03;0.8,0.8)⊗[(0.68,0.85,1.21,1.50;1,1)(0.72,0.88,1.17,1.43;0.8,0.8)⊗(1.18,1.45,1.94,2.24;1,1)(1.24,1.50,1.89,2.17;0.8,0.8)⊗(0.31,0.35,0.45,0.56;1,1)(0.32,0.35,0.44,0.53;0.8,0.8)⊗(0.44,0.50,0.66,0.82;1,1)(0.45,0.52,0.64,0.78;0.8,0.8)]−1=(0.19,0.29,0.53,0.73;1,1)(0.21,0.31,0.50,0.68;0.8,0.8)In the same way, we can obtain the remainingwi≈as follows:w2≈=(0.08,0.12,0.23,0.36;1,1)(0.09,0.13,0.22,0.32;0.8,0.8)w3≈=(0.14,0.21,0.37,0.53;1,1)(0.16,0.22,0.35,0.49;0.8,0.8)w4≈=(0.04,0.05,0.09,0.13;1,1)(0.04,0.05,0.08,0.12;0.8,0.8)w5≈=(0.05,0.07,0.13,0.19;1,1)(0.06,0.08,0.12,0.17;0.8,0.8)In order for weights obtained through Type-2 fuzzy AHP method to be used in TOPSIS method, Type-2 fuzzy weights have been defuzzified via the method of Center of Area (COA). Table 7presents the weights of each criteria and subcriteria.wj∼=∫xu(x)dx∫u(x)dx=−wj1×wj2+wj3×wj4+1/3(wj4−wj3)2−1/3(wj2−wj1)2−wj1−wj2+wj3+wj4Following determination of criteria weights via type-2 AHP method, Project evaluation process is carried on via TOPSIS method. If we used merely type-2 set, we could have continued the process without the need for normalization step. But, different from other studies in literature, our model allows use of both type-2 fuzzy set and crisp numbers. In addition to this, the unit free nature of crisp numbers made use of normalization a must to be able to continue process.Next, we multiplied each variable of decision matrix with weight of each criterion. Table 8shows the normalized defuzzified weighted decision matrix.Next step, we got the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution. After that, we calculated the distance d+(pj) between each alternative pjand the ideal solutionv+and we can calculate the distance d−(pj) between each alternative pjand the negative-ideal solutionv−respectively, where 1≤j≤5.d+(p1)=∑i=128(fi1−vi+)2=0.11d−(p1)=∑i=128(fi1−vi−)2=0.18d+=(0.11,0.20,0.06,0.12,0.10)d−=(0.18,0.08,0.21,0.17,0.18)In the last step we calculated the relative degree of closeness C(pj) of with respect to the positive ideal solutionv+, where 1≤j≤5 as shown in Table 9.Since C(p3)<C(p5)<C(p1)<C(p4)<C(p2) the suggested order of investment projects is:p3>p5>p1>p4>p2.When this ordering is considered, it is seen that the highest score belongs to third alternative (p3). Going into the details of the Project, its characteristics superior to other projects have been examined. As a result, it has been found out that corporate structure of the firm is strong, that transfer of new technology to the region with the help of the project will be achieved and that it will contribute to employment in the region. Apart from these, it is understood that economic outcome of the project is high too. When other projects in the ordering are considered too, it is seen that evaluation model works successfully.
