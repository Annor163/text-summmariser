@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Inter-dependency among the decision criteria and difficulty of establishing a common membership grade are two important issues to be addressed in multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problems in the environment of uncertainty. The main purpose of this paper is to define the Choquet integral operator for interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy sets (IVIHFS) and to extend the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method using Choquet integral operator in interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy environment. In the present study we define interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy Choquet integral (IVIHFCI) operator and extend the definition of hamming distance for the elements of IVIHFS. Using IVIHFCI operator and hamming distance for IVIHFS, we extend TOPSIS method for MCGDM for interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy environment considering the interaction phenomena among the decision criteria. An illustrative example has also been taken in the present study to understand the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) is one of the most useful distance measure based classical approaches to multi-criteria/multi-attribute decision making (MCDM/MADM) problems. The basic principle used in the TOPSIS is that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from positive-ideal solution and farthest from the negative-ideal solution. In classical TOPSIS methods, crisp numerical values are used to express the performance rating and criteria weights but human judgment, preference values and criteria weights are often ambiguous and cannot be represented using crisp numerical value in real-life situation. In order to handle the uncertainty arisen from the ambiguous and incomplete information, fuzzy set theory developed by Zadeh (1965) is successfully used in TOPSIS method (Chen, 2000; Jahanshahloo, Hosseinzadeh, & Izadikhah, 2006; Wang & Cheng, 2007; Wang & Elhag, 2006). Various methodologies were suggested for finding the core components of TOPSIS method e.g., positive ideal solution, negative ideal solution and distance measure to enhance TOPSIS method in fuzzy environment (Chu & Lin, 2009; Kuo, Tzeng, & Huang, 2007; Mahdavi, Mahdavi-Amiri, Heidarzade, & Nourifar, 2008; Wang & Lee, 2007, 2009). Roszkowska and Wachowicz (2015) applied fuzzy TOPSIS to score negotiation offers in ill-structured problems. Recently Chun (2015) proposed a method for MADM problem with sequentially presented decision alternatives based on the assumption that the decision-maker has a major attribute that must be “optimized” and minor attributes that must be “satisficed”.Fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1965) were extended to interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS) by Gozalczany (1987) and Turksen (1996) to represent the degree of membership of an element by an interval rather than exact numerical value. Wang and Li (1998) defined extended operations for IVFS. Chen and Tsao (2008) extended TOPSIS method for IVFS and did a comprehensive experimental analysis to observe the interval-valued fuzzy TOPSIS results yielded by different distance measures. Ashtiani, Haghighirad, Makuri, and Montazer (2009) also extended TOPSIS method for IVFS.Atanassov (1986) generalized the idea of fuzzy set to intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) to model the non-determinacy which occurs in the system because of the hesitation of decision makers. An IFS is characterized by a membership function and non-membership function and is proven more ideal tool than fuzzy set to describe imprecise or uncertain decision information. Boran, Gen, Kurt, and Akay (2009) extended fuzzy TOPSIS to intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS (IF-TOPSIS) for supplier selection problem. Atanassov and Gargov (1989) introduced interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) as further generalization of IFS in which unit intervals, [0,1] are used for membership and non-membership value rather than exact numerical values. Xu (2007) developed a few aggregation operators for IVIFS which were eventually used in MCDM problems. Later on TOPSIS method was extended for IVFS by researchers (Aloini, Dulmin, & Mininno, 2014; Park, Park, Kwun, & Tan, 2011; Tan & Zhang, 2006). Recently maximum entropy (Ahn, 2011) based TOPSIS methods using IFS and IVIFS are also proposed for MCDM problems (Joshi & Kumar, 2014; Zhang & Yu, 2012).In many practical problems, sometime it is difficult to define the membership grade of an element because of a set of possible membership values. This situation is very common in MCGDM problem when decision makers are not agreeing on the same membership grade for an element. In this case of difficulty of establishing a common membership grade is not because of margin of error (as happens in IFS) or some possible distribution values (as happens in type-2 fuzzy sets) but because of several possible membership values. To deal with these cases, hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) were introduced by Torra and Narukawa (2009) and Tora (2010) as a new generalization of fuzzy sets. Qian, Wang, and Feng (2013) gave the notion of generalized hesitant fuzzy sets and their application in decision support system. Relationship between entropy, similarity measure and distance measure for HFSs were also investigated (Farhadinia, 2013; Xu & Xia, 2011). Xu and Zhang (2013) proposed hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS for MADM problems. Zhu, Xu, and Xia (2012) extended HFS to dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS). DHFS can also be called intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy sets (IHFS) as it includes two functions that return two sets of possible membership values and non-membership values respectively, for each element in the domain. Chen, Xu, and Xia (2013) introduced interval-valued hesitant fuzzy set (IVHFS) that represent the membership degree of an element to a set with several possible interval values. IVHFS was further extended to interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy set (IVIHFS) with few aggregation operators and their application to group decision making problems (Peng, Wang, Wang, & Chen, 2014; Zhang, 2013).The aggregation operators proposed by Zhang (2013) are linear in nature and do not consider the inter-dependency or interactive characteristics of decision criteria or preferences of decision makers. Sugeno (1974) introduced fuzzy measure to model interaction phenomena among the decision criteria (Kojadinovic, 2002) and was used in many MCDM problems with inter-dependent decision criteria (Grabisch, 1997; Grabisch, Murofushi, & Sugeno, 2000; Ishii & Sugeno, 1985).From above analysis, we can see that in general, the assumption of independency of criteria is too strong to be satisfied in many MCDM and MCGDM problems. Motivated by the Choquet integral (Choquet, 1954; Dennberg, 1994), intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral was proposed by Tan and Chen (2010) and was used in TOPSIS method for MCDM problems with inter-dependent decision criteria (Beg & Rashid, 2014; Tan, 2011).A few aggregation operators to integrate the information in hesitant fuzzy and interval-valued hesitant fuzzy environment and their applications in MCDM problems were proposed by Xia and Xu (2011) and Wei, Zhao, and Lin (2013). Choquet integral operator to aggregate the hesitant fuzzy information for MCDM problems was also proposed (Yu, Wu, & Zhou, 2011). In the present study, we define interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy Choquet integral (IVIHFCI) operator. We also propose a TOPSIS method for MCGDM by using IVIHFCI operator with inter-dependent decision criteria. For this, we also extend hamming distance for IVIHFSs.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present definitions of HFS, IVIFS, IVIHFS and their operational laws found in the literature. Definition of Hamming distance is also extended for the elements of IVIHFS in this section. In Section 3, we review fuzzy measure and define IVIHFCI operator with few of its properties. We propose a TOPSIS method for MCGDM problem using IVIHFCI operator and hamming distance in Section 4. An example is given to understand the complete methodology of the proposed IVIHFCI operator based TOPSIS method along with its validity test in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are made in Section 6.In this section, we present the definitions of HFS, DHFS/IHFS, IVIHFS, score function and distance measure for the elements of IVIHFS. Throughout this paper,X={x1,x2,…….,xn}is used frequently to denote the reference set.Definition 2.1A hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) A on X is defined in terms of a function hA(x) that returns a subset of [0, 1] when it is applied to X. Mathematically, it is represented by following expression:(1)A={〈x,hA(x)〉|x∈X}Example 2.1IfX={x1,x2,x3}is the reference set,hA(x1)={0.3,0.5,0.7},hA(x2)={0.2,0.4,0.6}andhA(x3)={0.5,0.6}are the possible membership grade ofxi(i=1,2,3)to a set A, respectively. Then A can be considered as HFS and is represented as follows:A={<x1,{0.3,0.5,0.7}>,<x2,{0.2,0.4,0.6}>,<x3,{0.5,0.6}>}.Zhu et al. (2012) introduced the concept of DHFS/IHFS which is characterized by both membership hesitancy function and non-membership hesitancy function to support more exemplary and flexible access to assign values for each element in the domain.Definition 2.2A DHFS/IHFS D on X is defined in terms of two functions h(x), g(x), both return a subset of [0, 1] when they are applied to X. Mathematically, it is represented by following expression:(2)D={〈x,h(x),g(x)〉,∀x∈X}h(x) and g(x) represent the possible membership and non-membership degrees of the element x ∈ X to the set D, respectively and satisfy the following conditions:(3)γ≥0,η≤1,0≤γ++η+≤1∀γ∈h(x),η∈g(x),γ+,η+are defined as follows:(4)γ+∈h+(x)=∪γ∈h(x)max{γ}∀x∈X(5)η+∈g+(x)=∪η∈g(x)max{η}∀x∈XExample 2.2IfX={x1,x2}is the reference set,h(x1)={0.1,0.3,0.4},h(x2)={0.2,0.5,0.5},g(x1)={0.3,0.5,0.5},g(x2)={0.1,0.2,0.4}are the possible membership and non-membership grades ofxi(i=1,2)to a set D, respectively. Then D can be considered as DHFS/IHFS and is represented as follows:D={<x1,{0.1,0.3,0.4},{0.3,0.5}>,<x2,{0.2,0.5},{0.1,0.2,0.4}>}Zhang (2013) further introduced IVIHFS which is a generalization of IHFS that permits the membership and non-membership of an element to be a set of several possible interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers.Definition 2.3An IVIHFSE˜on X is defined in terms of a function that when applied to X returns a subset of set of all IVIF numbers. Mathematically it is represented by an object of the following form:(6)E˜={<x,hE˜(x)>∀x∈X}wherehE˜(x)is a set of some IVIF numbers denoting the possible membership degree intervals and non-membership degree intervals of the element x ∈ X to the setE˜. For convenience, we callh˜=hE˜(x)interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy element (IVIHFE) andH˜is the set of all IVIHFEs. Ifα∈h˜, then α is an IVIFN, and it is denoted byα=(μα,να)=([μα−,μα+],[να−,να+]). Following are some operations defined on IVIHFEs.(1)h˜c={αc|α∈h˜}={([να−,να+],[μα−,μα+])|α∈h˜}h˜1∪h˜2={α1∨α2|α1∈h˜1,α2∈h˜2}={([μα1−∨μα2−,μα1+∨μα2+],[να1−∧να2−,να1+∧να2+])|α1∈h˜`1,α2∈h˜2}h˜1∩h˜2={α1∧α2|α1∈h˜1,α2∈h˜2}={([μα1−∧μα2−,μα1+∧μα2+],[να1−∨να2−,να1+∨να2+])|α1∈h˜`1,α2∈h˜2}where, ∧ and ∨ are min and max operators.(4)h˜1⊗h˜2={α1⊗α2|α1∈h1,α2∈h2}={([μα1−μα2−,μα1+μα2+],[να1−+να2−−να1−να2−,να1++να2+−να1+να2+])|α1∈`h˜1,α2∈h˜2}h˜1⊕h˜2={α1⊕α2|α1∈h1,α2∈h2}={([μα1−+μα2−−μα1−μα2−,μα1++μα2+−μα1+μα2+][να1−να2−,να1+να2+])|α1∈`h˜1,α2∈h˜2}λh˜={λα|α∈h˜}={([1−(1−μα−)λ,1−(1−μα+)λ],[(να−)λ,(να+)λ])|α∈h˜},λ>0h˜λ={αλ|α∈h˜}={([(μα−)λ,(μα+)λ][1−(1−να−)λ,1−(1−να+)λ])|α∈h˜},λ>0Following example shows that for any three IVIHFEsh˜,h˜1,h˜2and λ ≥ 0h˜1⊕h˜2,h˜1⊗h˜2,λh˜andh˜λare also IVIHFEs.Example 2.3Supposeh˜={([0.3,0.4],[0.5,0.6]),([0.7,0.9],[0.1,0.1])},h˜1={([0.2,0.4],[0.1,0.3]),([0.6,0.8],[0.1,0.2]),([0.1,0.4],[0.5,0.6])},h˜2={([0.5,0.6],[0.4,0.4]),([0.7,0.8],[0.1,0.2]),([0.4,0.6],[0.2,0.3])}are three IVIHFEs, then operations defined in Definition 2.3 are given as follows:h˜c={([0.5,0.6],[0.3,0.4]),([0.1,0.1],[0.7,0.9])}h˜1∪h˜2={([0.5,0.6],[0.1,0.3]),([0.7,0.8],[0.1,0.2)]),([0.4,0.6],[0.2,0.3)]}h˜1∩h˜2={([0.2,0.4],[0.4,0.4]),([0.6,0.8],[0.1,0.2)]),([0.1,0.4],[0.5,0.6)]}h˜1⊗h˜2={([0.1,0.24],[0.46,0.58]),([0.42,0.64],[0.19,0.36]),([0.04,0.24],[0.6,0.72])}={([0.1,0.24],[0.46,0.58]),([0.42,0.64],[0.19,0.36]),([0.04,0.24],[0.6,0.72])}h˜1⊕h˜2={([0.6,0.76],[0.04,0.12]),([0.88,0.96],[0.01,0.04]),([0.46,0.76],[0.1,0.18])}Letλ=2λh˜={([1−(1−0.3)2,1−(1−0.4)2],[(0.5)2,(0.6)2]),([1−(1−0.7)2,1−(1−0.9)2],[(0.1)2,(0.1)2])}={([0.51,0.64],[0.25,0.36]),([0.91,0.99],[0.01,0.01])}h˜λ={([(0.3)2,(0.4)2][1−(1−0.5)2,1−(1−0.6)2]),([(0.7)2,(0.9)2][1−(1−0.1)2,1−(1−0.1)2])}={([0.09,0.16],[0.75,0.84]),([0.49,0.81],[0.19,0.19])}For comparing two IVIHFEs, score function (Zhang, 2013) is defined as follows:Definition 2.4Leth˜be an IVIFE. Score functionS(h˜)as follows:(7)S(h˜)=∑α∈h˜S(α)/#h˜where#h˜is the number of the elements inh˜. For any two IVIHFEsh˜1andh˜2, if(1)S(h˜1)>S(h˜2),thenh˜1>h˜2S(h˜1)<S(h˜2),thenh˜1<h˜2S(h˜1)=S(h˜2),thenh˜1=h˜2Example 2.4Leth˜1= {([0.5, 0.6], [0.3, 0.4]), ([0.7, 0.8], [0.1, 0.2]), ([0.1, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6)]} andh˜2= {([0.3, 0.5], [0.3, 0.5]), ([0.7, 0.9], [0.1, 0.1)])} be two IVIHFEs.S(h˜1)=16(0.2+0.2+0.6+0.6−0.2−0.4)=0.1667S(h˜2)=14(0+0+0.6+0.8)=0.3500Then according to Definition 2.4,h˜1<h˜2.Xu and Xia (2011) defined distance measure for HFSs which was extended for IVHFSs byChen et al. (2013). Generalized hesitant fuzzy weighted distance measure and the generalized hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted distance measure were also proposed by Xu and Xia (2011). In following definition, we extend definitions of Hamming distance and Euclidean distance for IVIHFs.Definition 2.5Leth˜andf˜be two IVIHFEs on X, ασ(i) and βσ(i)(i = 1,2,…….,n) be the ith smallest value inh˜andf˜, then normalized Hamming distance and Euclidean distance betweenh˜andf˜are given by following expressions:(8)d(h˜,f˜)=14n∑i=1n(|μασ(i)−−μβσ(i)−|+|μασ(i)+−μβσ(i)+|+|νασ(i)−−νβσ(i)−|+|νασ(i)+−νβσ(i)+|)(9)d(h˜,f˜)=14n∑i=1n(|μασ(i)−−μβσ(i)−|2+|μασ(i)+−μβσ(i)+|2+|νασ(i)−−νβσ(i)−|2+|νασ(i)+−νβσ(i)+|2)Since the number of interval values for different IVIHFEs could be different, we can make them equivalent through adding elements to the IVIHFE that has a less number of elements. We can add the smallest element, in terms of pessimistic principle while the opposite case will be adopted in optimistic principle. Proposed distance measures for IVIHFEs satisfy following properties:(1)0≤d(h˜,f˜)≤1d(h˜,f˜)=0ifandonlyifh˜=f˜d(h˜,f˜)=d(f˜,h˜)Fuzzy measure (a non-additive measure) which makes monotonic property instead of additive property was introduced by Sugeno in 1974. Till the end of eighties, Sugeno integral was an important aggregating tool for MCDM problems for computing an average global score, taking into account the importance of criteria represented by fuzzy measure. Then, after Choquet integral which is an extension of Lebesgue integral was proposed by Murofushi and Sugeno (1993) to take into account the importance of criteria represented by fuzzy measure. Many researchers (Labreuche & Grabisch, 2003; Marichal, 2000; Murofushi & Sugeno, 1993) used Choquet integral operator instead of weighted/ordered weighted arithmetic mean operators to model interaction phenomena in decision making problems. Choquet integral operator based MCDM methods with dependent criteria use fuzzy measure to define weight of each combination of criteria. In this sub section, definitions of fuzzy measure, λ-fuzzy measure, discrete Choquet integral and intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operators are presented as follows:Definition 3.1A fuzzy measure on X is a set function μ: P(X) → [0, 1] satisfying the following properties:(1)μ(ϕ)=0andμ(X)=1(Boundary conditions)If A, B ∈ P(X) and A⊆B then μ(A) ≤ μ(B) (Monotonicity)Even though it is necessary to add the axiom of continuity when X is infinite, it is enough to consider finite universal set in actual practice.μ({c1,c2,…….,cn)}can be considered as the grade of subjective importance of decision criteria set{c1,c2,…….,cn}. Thus with the separate weights of criteria, weights of any combination of criteria can also be defined. Following are few remarks about any pair of criteria sets A, B ∈ P(X) with the condition A∩ B ∈ ϕ.(i)A and B are independent (without interaction) ifμ(A∪B)=μ(A)+μ(B). This is called an additive measure.Positive interaction between A and B is exhibited ifμ(A∪B)>μ(A)+μ(B). This is called super additive measure.Negative interaction between A and B is exhibited ifμ(A∪B)<μ(A)+μ(B). This is called sub additive measure.Since it is difficult to determine the fuzzy measure according to Definition 3.1, therefore, in order to confirm fuzzy measure in MCGDM problems, Sugeno (1974) proposed following λ-fuzzy measure.μ(A∪B)=μ(A)+μ(B)+λμ(A)μ(B),λ∈[−1,∞)∀A,B∈P(X)andA∩B=ϕParameter λ determines interaction between the criteria. In above equation, ifλ=0, λ-fuzzy measure is reduced to simply additive measure. And for negative and positive λ, λ-fuzzy measure is reduced to sub-additive and super-additive measure respectively.If X is finite, then λ-fuzzy measure satisfies following equation.(10)μ(X)=1λ(∏i=1n[1+λμ(xi)−1),λ≠0Using (10), parameter λ can be uniquely determined using boundary conditionμ(X)=1which is equivalent to solving following equation:(11)λ+1=∏i=1n(1+λμ(xi)Definition 3.2Let F be a positive real-valued function on X, and µ be a fuzzy measure on X. Discrete Choquet integral of f with respective to µ is defined as follows:(12)Cμ(F)=∑i=1nF(i)[μ(A(i))−μ(A(i+1))]Definition 3.3Let X be the collection of n intuitionistic fuzzy numbers on X, defined asai=(tai,fai)(i = 1, 2, …, n), and µ be a fuzzy measure on X. Then the (discrete) intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral of intuitionistic fuzzy number aiwith respective to µ is given by the following expression:(13)IFCμ(a1,a2,……,an)=∑i=1na(i)(μ(A(i))−μ(A(i+1)))where (⋅) indicates a permutation on X such thata(1)≤a(2)≤a(3)≤………≤a(n)AlsoA(i)=(i,i+1,………,n),A(n+1)=ϕ.Zhang (2013) proposed a few aggregating operators to aggregate the IVIHF information with the assumption that criteria are independent. In this subsection we define IVIHFCI operator to take into account the interaction phenomena between the criteria represented by fuzzy measure.Definition 3.4Let μ be a fuzzy measure on X, andh˜i(i = 1, 2, …, n) be a collection of IVIHFEs on X. Then IVIHFCI is defined as follows:(14)IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=⊗i=1n(h˜σ(i))μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))={([∏i=1n(μασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),∏i=1n(μασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))],[1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))])×|ασ(1)∈h˜σ(1),……ασ(n)∈h˜σ(n)}(σ(1), σ(2), ....σ(n)) is a permutation of (1, 2, ….., n), such thath˜σ(1)≥h˜σ(2)≥……h˜σ(n)andh˜σ(0)=ϕ.Theorem 3.1Let μ be a fuzzy measure on X, andh˜i(i = 1, 2, …, n) be a collection of IVIHFEs on X.h˜σ(i)be the ith largest of them, then their aggregated value using IVIHFCI operator is also IVIHF value, andIVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)={([∏i=1n(μασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),∏i=1n(μασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))],[1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))])×|ασ(1)∈h˜σ(1),……ασ(n)∈h˜σ(n)}Proof: We prove this theorem by using mathematical induction. For n = 1, result is immediately follows from the Definition 3.4For n = 2, according to Definition 2.3, we haveh˜2μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1))=([(μασ(2)−)μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1))(μασ(2)+)μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1))]×[1−(1−νασ(2)−)μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1)),1−(1−νασ(2)+)μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1))])Sinceh˜1⊗h˜2={([μα1−μα2−,μα1+μα2+],[να1−+να2−−να1−να2−,να1++να2+−να1+να2+])|α1∈`h˜1,α2∈h˜2}Therefore,IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2)=h˜1μ(Aσ(1))⊗h˜2μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1))=([(μασ(1)−)μ(Aσ(1))(μασ(2)−)μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1)),(μασ(2)+)μ(Aσ(1))(μασ(2)+)μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1))]×[1−(1−νασ(1)−)μ(Aσ(1))1−(1−νασ(2)−)μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1)),1−(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(1))1−(1−νασ(2)+)μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1))])Hence the theorem holds for n = 2.Let the theorem holds for n = k, i.e.,IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜k)={([∏i=1k(μασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),∏i=1k(μασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))],[1−∏i=1k(1−νασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),1−∏i=1k(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))])×|ασ(1)∈h˜σ(1),……ασ(k)∈h˜σ(k)}Then for n = k + 1, we haveIVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜k+1)=([(μασ(k+1)−)μ(Aσ(k+1))−μ(Aσ(k))∏i=1k(μασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),(μασ(k+1)+)μ(Aσ(k+1))−μ(Aσ(k))∏i=1k(μασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))],[1−(1−νασ(k+1)−)μ(Aσ(k+1))−μ(Aσ(k))∏i=1k(1−νασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),1−(1−νασ(k+1)+)μ(Aσ(k+1))−μ(Aσ(k))∏i=1k(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))])={([∏i=1k+1(μασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),∏i=1k+1(μασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))],[1−∏i=1k+1(1−νασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),1−∏i=1k+1(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))])Hence the theorem holds for n = k +1, which completes the proof of Theorem 3.1.Following propositions are special cases of the proposed IVIHFCI operator.Proposition 3.1Ifμ(A)=∑xi∈Aμ({xi})holds for all A⊆X with∑i=1nμ({xi})=1then(15)μ({xi})=μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),i=1,2,……nIn this case, the IVIHFCI operator reduces to following interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric (IVIHFWG) operator.(16)IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=IVIHFWG(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)Proof:IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=={([∏i=1n(μασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),∏i=1n(μασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))],[1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))])×|ασ(1)∈h˜σ(1),……ασ(n)∈h˜σ(n)}=⊗i=1n(h˜σ(i))μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))Now,μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))=μ({xi})and∑i=1nμ({xi})=1, thenIVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=⊗i=1n(h˜i)μ({xi})=IVIHFWG(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)Proposition 3.2Ifμ({xi})=1nfor all i = 1, 2, …, n, then the IVIHFWG operator reduces to following interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy averaging operator (IVIHFA) operator:(17)IVIHFA(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=⊗i=1n(h˜i1n)Proof:IVIHFWG(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=⊗i=1n(h˜i)μ({xi})If we take,μ({xi})=1nfor all i =1,2,…..n then,IVIHFWG(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=⊗i=1n(h˜i)1n=IVIHFA(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)Proposition 3.3Ifμ({xi})=∑i=1|A|wifor all A⊆X where |A| is the number of the elements in the set A, thenwi=μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),i=1,2,....n, and∑i=1nwi=1. In this case the IVIHFCI operator reduces to following interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (IVIHFOWG) operator:(18)IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=IVIHFOWG(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)Proof:IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)={([∏i=1n(μασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),∏i=1n(μασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))],[1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))])×|ασ(1)∈h˜σ(1),……ασ(n)∈h˜σ(n)}Now,μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))=wiand∑i=1nwi=1, thenIVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)={([∏i=1n(μασ(i)−)wi,∏i=1n(μασ(i)+)wi],[1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)−)wi,1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)+)wi])×|ασ(1)∈h˜σ(1),……ασ(n)∈h˜σ(n)}=⊗i=1n(h˜σ(i)wi)=IVIHFOWG(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)Following are few properties of IVIHFCI which are immediately followed from the definition of IVIHFCI and Theorem 3.1.1.Let μ be a fuzzy measure on X, andh˜i(i = 1, 2,…, n) be a collection of IVIHFEs on X, then(i)If(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)is any permutation ofh˜i, then(19)IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)If f is an IVIHFE on X, then(20)IVIHFCI(h˜1⊗f,h˜2⊗f,……h˜n⊗f)=IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)⊗fFor(21)λ>0,IVIHFCI(h˜1λ,h˜2λ,……h˜nλ)=(IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n))λIf for all i,ασ(i)=α, where ασ(i) are elements of hi, α is the element ofh˜, then(22)IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)=h˜For any two collectionsh˜i(i =1, 2, …, n) andf˜i(i = 1, 2, …, n) of IVIHFEs on X, following two properties hold.(i)IVIHFCI(h˜1⊗f1,h˜2⊗f2,……h˜n⊗fn)=IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)⊗IVIHFCI(f1,f2,…fn)for all ασ(i) ≤ βσ(i),IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)≤IVIHFCI(f1,f2,…fn)whereασ(i)∈h˜iand βσ(i) ∈ fi.In this section, we propose interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy Choquet integral operator based TOPSIS method for MCGDM problems using normalized hamming distance for IVIHFEs.LetA={A1,A2,…..Am}andC={C1,C2,…..Cn}be sets of m alternatives and of n criteria. Assume that the performance of the alternativeAi(i=1,2,…,m)with respect to criteriaCj(j=1,2,…,n)is measured by an interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy elementh˜ij={αij|αij∈h˜ij}={([μαij−,μαij+],[ναij−,ναij+])|αij∈h˜ij}. If two or more decision maker provide the same value, then the value comes only once inh˜ij. Various steps used in proposed TOPSIS for MCGDM are explained as follows:Step 1. Construct an interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy decision matrixD˜=(h˜ij)m×nwhereh˜ij={αij|αij∈h˜ij}={([μαij−,μαij+],[ναij−,ναij+])|αij∈h˜ij}denotes an IVIHFE, when alternative Aiis evaluated by decision makers with respect to criteria Cj.Step 2. Confirm the fuzzy measures of criteria set C by satisfying the axioms of λ-fuzzy measure given by Definition 3.1.Step 3. Determine the preference of one permutation to other according to score function and then utilize the proposed following IVIHFCI to aggregate all IVIHFEs[h˜ij]mxntoh˜i(i=1,2,….m).IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)={([∏i=1n(μασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),∏i=1n(μασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))],[1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))])×|ασ(1)∈h˜σ(1),……ασ(n)∈h˜σ(n)}to aggregate allh˜ij(j = 1,2,…n) intoh˜i(i = 1,2,…m) of the alternative Ai.Step 4. The interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy positive-ideal solution (IVIHF-PIS), denoted (h˜+), and interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy negative-ideal solution (IVIHF-NIS) denoted (h˜−), are given by following expressions:h˜+={([maxμαij−,maxμαij+],[minναij−,minναij+])|αij∈B),([minμαij−,minμαij+],[maxναij−,maxναij+]|αij∈C)}h˜−={([minμαij−,minμαij+],[maxναij−,maxναij+])|αij∈B),([maxμαij−,maxμαij+],[minναij−,minναij+]|αij∈C)}where B and C are the collection of benefit and cost criteria respectively. For convenience,α+andα−are denoted as follows:α+=([maxμαij−,maxμαij+],[minναij−,minναij+])α−=([minμαij−,minμαij+],[maxναij−,maxναij+])Asα+andα−are largest and smallest interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values respectively, thereforeα+=([1,1],[0,0])andα−=([0,0],[1,1]).Step 5. Use following extension of Hamming distance for IVIHFE to calculate the distanced1(Ai,α+)andd1(Ai,α−)which are distances between the alternative Aifrom IVIHF-PIS and IVIHF-NIS, respectively.d(h˜,f˜)=14n∑i=1n(|μασ(i)−−μβσ(i)−|+|μασ(i)+−μβσ(i)+|+|νασ(i)−−νβσ(i)−|+|νασ(i)+−νβσ(i)+|)Step 6. Calculate closeness coefficient of each alternative using following expression.(23)Ccj=d1(Ai,α−)d1(Ai,α+)+d1(Ai,α−),i=1,2,3,…,mStep 7. Finally, rank all the alternatives Ai(i = 1, 2, …, m) according to the descending order of closeness coefficient values. The most preferred alternative is the one with the highest value of closeness coefficient.Let us suppose that a committee of experts intend to recruit a project manager from a group of four candidates A1, A2, A3 and A4 on the basis of a set of following criteria:C1: knowledgeC2: reliabilityC3: demandingIn the following steps, we use the proposed method to evaluate all four alternatives to choose the best one on the basis of above mentioned criteria.Step 1. The four candidates Ai(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are evaluated using interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy information by three decision makers. If all evaluations of a candidate by all three decision makers are same, then it is considered only once. Table 1 shows evaluation of each decision maker about the alternative Ai(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) under the criteria Cj(j = 1, 2, 3) and is denoted by an IVIHFEh˜ij(i = 1, 2, 3, 4; j = 1, 2, 3).Step 2. Suppose following are the fuzzy measures of criteria of Cμ(C1)=0.4,μ(C2)=0.3,μ(C3)=0.4Parameterλ=0.5is obtained using (11) and following are obtained.μ(C1,C2)=0.76,μ(C2,C3)=0.76,μ(C1,C3)=0.88μ(C1,C2,C3)=1Step 3. We determine the preference of one permutation over other by using score function using (7) to aggregate allh˜ij(j = 1, 2,…, n) are aggregated intoh˜i(i = 1, 2,…, m) of the alternative Ai,S(h˜11)=∑α∈h˜11S(α)/#h˜11=16(0.6+0.8+0.5+0.6−0.3−0.2)=0.33S(h˜12)=∑α∈h˜12S(α)/#h˜12=14(0.3+0.3−0.7−0.8)=−0.225S(h˜13)=∑α∈h˜13S(α)/#h˜13=12(0.7+0.8)=0.75Then,S(h˜13)>S(h˜11)>S(h˜12)h1σ(1)=h13,h1σ(2)=h11,h1σ(3)=h12μ(Aσ(1))−μ(Aσ(0))=μ(Aσ(1))=μ(C3)=0.4μ(Aσ(2))−μ(Aσ(1))=μ(C1,C3)−μ(C3)=0.48μ(Aσ(3))−μ(Aσ(2))=μ(C1,C2,C3)−μ(C2,C3)=0.24Therefore,h˜1=IVIHFCI(h˜11,h˜12,h˜13)Now we use definition of IVIHFCI operator ((Eq. 18))IVIHFCI(h˜1,h˜2,……h˜n)={([∏i=1n(μασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),∏i=1n(μασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))],[1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)−)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1)),1−∏i=1n(1−νασ(i)+)μ(Aσ(i))−μ(Aσ(i−1))])×|ασ(1)∈h˜σ(1),……ασ(n)∈h˜σ(n)}allh˜ij(j = 1,2,…n) are aggregated intoh˜i(i = 1,2,…m) of the alternative Ai, Following is the detailed computation.=IVIHFCI({([0.7,0.9],[0.1,0.1])([0.6,0.8],[0.1,0.2]),([0.3,0.4],[0.6,0.6])}{([0.5,0.6],[0.2,0.2])([0.1,0.1],[0.8,0.9])}{([0.8,0.9],[0.1,0.1])})={([(0.8)0.4(0.7)0.48(0.5)0.24,(0.9)0.4(0.9)0.48(0.6)0.24],[1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.1)0.48(1−0.2)0.24,1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.1)0.48(1−0.3)0.24])([(0.8)0.4(0.7)0.48(0.1)0.24,(0.9)0.4(0.9)0.48(0.1)0.24],[1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.1)0.48(1−0.8)0.24,1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.1)0.48(1−0.9)0.24])([(0.8)0.4(0.6)0.48(0.5)0.24,(0.9)0.4(0.8)0.48(0.6)0.24],[1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.1)0.48(1−0.2)0.24,1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.2)0.48(1−0.3)0.24])([(0.8)0.4(0.6)0.48(0.1)0.24,(0.9)0.4(0.8)0.48(0.1)0.24],[1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.1)0.48(1−0.8)0.24,1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.2)0.48(1−0.9)0.24])([(0.8)0.4(0.3)0.48(0.5)0.24,(0.9)0.4(0.4)0.48(0.6)0.24],[1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.6)0.48(1−0.2)0.24,1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.6)0.48(1−0.3)0.24])([(0.8)0.4(0.3)0.48(0.1)0.24,(0.9)0.4(0.4)0.48(0.1)0.24],[1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.6)0.48(1−0.8)0.24,1−(1−0.1)0.4(1−0.6)0.48(1−0.9)0.24])}h˜1={([0.65,0.81],[0.14,0.16])([0.44,0.52][0.38,0.48])([0.61,0.76],[0.14.0.16])([0.41,0.50],[0.38,0.50])([0.43,0.55],[0.27,0.43])([0.30,0.35],[0.58,0.65])}Similarly,h˜2,h˜3andh˜4have been computed as follows:h˜2={([0.16,0.29],[0.53,0.64])([0.20,0.34][0.53,0.61])}h˜3={([0.28,0.43],[0.42,0.52])([0.25,0.41][0.42,0.53])([0.21,0.43],[0.47.0.52])([0.19,0.41],[0.47,0.53])}h˜4={([0.1,0.17],[0.61,0.81])([0.14,0.16][0.64,0.83])([0.13,0.18],[0.61.0.80])([0.14,0.22],[0.57,0.77])([0.17,0.20],[0.6,0.8])([0.19,0.23],[0.52,0.76])}Step 4. Interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy positive-ideal solution (IVIHF-PIS) and interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy negative-ideal solution (IVIHF-NIS), for cost criterion C3 and benefit criteria C1 and C2 are given as follows:h˜+={([1,1],[0,0])([1,1],[0,0])([0,0],[1,1])}h˜−={([0,0],[1,1])([0,0],[1,1])([1,1],[0,0])}Step 5. Using distance measure given by Eq. (8), distance of the alternative Ai(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) from IVIHF-PIS (h+) and IVIHF-NIS (h−) is calculated as follows:d1(A1,h+)=124(|1−0.65|+|1−0.81|+|0−0.14|+|0−0.16|+|1−0.44|+|1−0.52|+|0−0.38|+|0−0.48|+|0−0.61|+|0−0.76|+|1−0.14|+|1−0.16|+|1−0.41|+|1−0.50|+|0−0.38|+|0−0.50|+|1−0.43|+|1−0.55|+|0−0.27|+|0−0.43|+|0−0.30|+|0−0.35|+|1−0.58|+|1−0.65|=0.48Similarly, distances of other alternatives from IVIHF-PIS (h+) and IVIHF-NIS (h−) are calculated which are as follows:d1(A1,h−)=0.497d1(A2,h+)=0.56,d1(A2,h−)=0.2445d1(A3,h+)=0.579,d1(A3,h−)=0.421d1(A4,h+)=0.598,d1(A4,h−)=0.402Step 6. According to Eq. (23), following closeness coefficientCci(i=1,2,3,4)of each alternative is calculated.Cc1=0.5087Cc2=0.3039Cc3=0.4206Cc4=0.4014Step 7. Finally, we rank all the alternatives Ai(i =1, 2, 3, 4) as A1 > A3 > A4 > A2 according to the descending order of closeness coefficient values. Thus the most desirable alternative is A1.Since practically it is not possible to determine which one is the best suitable alternative for a given decision problem, Wang and Triantaphyllou (2008), established following testing criteria to evaluate the validity of MCDM methods.Testcriterion1. An effective MCDM method should not change the indication of the best alternative on replacing a non-optimal alternative by another worse alternative without changing the relative importance of each decision criteria.Testcriterion2. An effective MCDM method should follow transitive property.Testcriterion3. When a MCDM problem is decomposed into smaller problems and same MCDM method is applied on smaller problems to rank the alternatives, combined ranking of the alternatives should be identical to the original ranking of un-decomposed problem.The validity of the proposed IVIHFCI operator based TOPSIS method is tested using these test criterions.In order to test the validity of the proposed IVIHFCI based TOPSIS method under test criterion 1, following interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy decision matrix (Table 2) is used. This decision matrix is obtained by interchanging the intervals of membership and non-membership grades of alternatives A3 (non-optimal alternative) and A2 (worse alternative) in Table 1. According to the test criterion 1, with this change, indication of the best alternative should be identical to the original MCGDM problem.Since, the relative importance of the criteria remains unchanged in modified MCGDM problem, therefore, fuzzy measures of criteria of C and criteria sets of C are as follows:μ(C1)=0.4,μ(C2)=0.3,μ(C3)=0.4μ(C1,C2)=0.76,μ(C2,C3)=0.76,μ(C1,C3)=0.88μ(C1,C2,C3)=1Using step 3 of the proposed IVIHFCI based TOPSIS method,h˜1,h˜2,h˜3,andh˜4are calculated for modified interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy decision matrix (Table 2) as follows:h˜1={([0.65,0.81],[0.14,0.16])([0.44,0.52][0.38,0.48])([0.61,0.76],[0.14.0.16])([0.41,0.50],[0.38,0.50])([0.43,0.55],[0.27,0.43])([0.30,0.35],[0.58,0.65])}h˜2={([0.467,0.6],[0.2308,0.3228])([0.4674,0.5578][0.3277,0.4945])}h˜3={([0.28,0.34],[0.48,0.63])([0.28,0.40][0.37,0.53])([0.3,0.34],[0.45.0.64])([0.3,0.40],[0.316,0.534])}h˜4={([0.1,0.17],[0.61,0.81])([0.14,0.16][0.64,0.83])([0.13,0.18],[0.61.0.80])([0.14,0.22],[0.57,0.77])([0.17,0.20],[0.6,0.8])([0.19,0.23],[0.52,0.76])}Using step 4 and step 5 of the IVIHFCI based TOPSIS method, following distance measures of the alternativesAi(i=1,2,…..m)from IVIHF-PIS (h+) and IVIHF-NIS (h−) are calculated:d1(A1,h+)=0.48,d1(A1,h−)=0.497d1(A2,h+)=0.525,d1(A2,h−)=0.586d1(A3,h+)=0.526,d1(A3,h−)=0.338d1(A4,h+)=0.598,d1(A4,h−)=0.402According to Eq. (23), following are closeness coefficientCci(i=1,2,3,4)of each alternative.Cc1=0.5087Cc2=0.5274Cc3=0.3910Cc4=0.4014According to the descending order of values of closeness coefficient, the alternatives are ranked as A1 > A4 > A3 > A2. Since, the indication of the best alternative is again A1 which is same as in the original MCGDM problem, therefore, it is confirmed that the proposed TOPSIS method does not change the indication of the best alternative when a non-optimal alternative is replaced by another worse alternative. Hence the proposed TOPSIS method is valid under test criterion 1 established by Wang and Triantaphyllou (2008).In order to test validity of proposed TOPSIS method using test criterion 2 and test criterion 3, original MCGDM problem is decomposed into a set of smaller MCGDM problems {A1, A2, A3} and { A2, A3, A4}. Following the steps of proposed TOPSIS method, rankings A1 > A3 > A2 and A3 > A4 > A2 are obtained for smaller MCGDM problems.If the rankings of the alternatives of sub-problems are combined together, the final ranking A1 > A3 > A4 > A2 is obtained which is identical to the ranking of un-decomposed MCGDM problem and exhibits transitive property. Hence the proposed TOPSIS method is valid under test criterion 2 and test criterion 3 established Wang and Triantaphyllou (2008).
