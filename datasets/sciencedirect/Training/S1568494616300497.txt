@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy permutation method with likelihood-based preference functions for managing multiple criteria decision analysis based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. First, certain likelihood-based preference functions are proposed using the likelihoods of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relationships. Next, selected practical indices of concordance/discordance are established to evaluate all possible permutations of the alternatives. The optimal priority order of the alternatives is determined by comparing all comprehensive concordance/discordance values based on score functions. Furthermore, this paper considers various preference types and develops another interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy permutation method using programming models to address multiple criteria decision-making problems with incomplete preference information. The feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods are illustrated in the problem of selecting a suitable bridge construction method. Moreover, certain comparative analyses are conducted to verify the advantages of the proposed methods compared with those of other decision-making methods. Finally, the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with a risk assessment problem in new product development.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets, which are characterized by both a degree of membership and a degree of non-membership, provides a flexible method of capturing the uncertainty in multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) [1–3]. The IF sets offer better flexibility and practicality in the treatment of fuzzy information and uncertainty than ordinary fuzzy sets [3,4]. However, in human cognitive and decision-making activities, it is not completely justifiable or technically sound to quantify degrees of membership and non-membership in terms of a single numeric value [5,6]. If an entity is uncertain due to insufficient information availability, it is difficult to specify an exact value for the degrees of membership and non-membership of an uncertain item. Because the available information is not always sufficient in many real-life situations [7], interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) sets with interval-valued membership and non-membership grades are appropriate for addressing such problems.The IVIF sets, as proposed by Atanassov and Gargov [8], are generalizations of IF sets. The concept of IVIF sets is characterized by a membership function and a non-membership function whose values are intervals rather than exact numbers. The IVIF sets are better than IF sets due to their great ability to handle imprecise and ambiguous information in practical applications [5,7,9,10]. Real-world decisions often require the use of more precise and accurate data [70]. Therefore, IVIF sets are appropriate for addressing multiple criteria decision-making problems within a complex and uncertain environment, and IVIF sets have been productively applied in the MCDA field in recent years [5,7,11–27]. For example, Ebrahimnejad et al. [13] proposed a new ELECTRE method with novel indices in an IVIF context for the evaluation process in terms of insufficient and inaccurate information. Razavi Hajiagha et al. [16] suggested an extended form of the complex proportional assessment method used for group decision making within an IVIF environment. Razavi Hajiagha et al. [17] constructed a novel linear programming based model to solve group decision-making problems with IVIF information. Wan and Dong [18] and Wan and Li [19] developed useful IVIF mathematical programming methods for solving hybrid group decision-making problems and heterogeneous MCDA problems, respectively, with IVIF truth degrees and incomplete weight information. Wu and Chiclana [21] presented the IVIF continuous ordered weighted averaging operator and a novel attitudinal expected score function for IVIF numbers by taking into account of the decision maker's attitudinal character. Zavadskas et al. [7] proposed a methodology combining the strengths of the weighted aggregated sum product assessment and IVIF sets in handling uncertainty with the enhanced accuracy of MCDA. Zavadskas et al. [25] developed the IVIF MULTIMOORA (i.e., Multiobjective Optimization by Ratio Analysis plus Full Multiplicative Form) method for group decision making.IVIF sets are able to address the uncertainty of multiple criteria evaluations and quantify the ambiguous nature of subjective assessments in a convenient manner. Accordingly, this paper attempts to develop a permutation-based outranking method for MCDA based on IVIF sets. However, in the literature on permutation-based methodology, comparatively little research has focused on the development of the permutation methods based on IVIF sets. Chen and Wang [28] developed an interval-valued fuzzy permutation method for addressing MCDA problems and conducted an experimental analysis using cardinal and ordinal evaluations. Nevertheless, the interval-valued fuzzy permutation method was defined within the environment of interval-valued fuzzy sets, and the method proposed by Chen and Wang cannot handle MCDA problems based on IVIF sets. Additionally, Chen and Wang [28] did not discuss the observation that information on the importance weights of criteria is only partially known. Incomplete preference information often occurs in real-world decision-making situations. However, the interval-valued fuzzy permutation method does not offer sufficient flexibility to manage MCDA problems in which the preference information is incompletely known. Based on the above considerations, this paper develops an effective and flexible permutation-based outranking method for solving MCDA problems in the IVIF decision context based separately on IVIF importance weights and incomplete preference information.In addition, this paper advances the innovative idea of incorporating preference functions in the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) into the main structure of the permutation methods, which is an approach that differs significantly from the existing permutation-based methodology. The PROMETHEE, introduced by Brans [29], is a well-known outranking method for managing MCDA problems [30,31]. Classical PROMETHEE recommends six basic types of generalized criteria, i.e., the usual criterion, a U-shape criterion, a V-shape criterion, a level criterion, a V-shape with indifference criterion, and a Gaussian criterion [29,32,33], and one must select appropriate preference functions to construct these generalized criteria. The generalized criteria and their corresponding preference functions can be used to express the importance of the relative differences between alternatives for a certain criterion and the weights that indicate the relative importance of the criterion [34]. Motivated by the generalized criteria in the PROMETHEE methodology, this paper constructs useful likelihood-based preference functions via the likelihoods of the IVIF preference relationship. Furthermore, this paper incorporates the likelihood-based preference functions into the core structure of the proposed IVIF permutation methods.An approach using likelihood-based comparisons has been successfully applied to address MCDA problems [5,35–42]. For example, Xu and Da [42] introduced the concept of fuzzy preference relationships based on interval values and proposed a likelihood-based method to rank the priority between intervals. Lee and Chen [38] proposed a method for fuzzy decision-making based on likelihood-based comparison relationships using interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Chen and Lee [36] employed the likelihoods of fuzzy preference relationships to present an approach for acquiring the ranking values of trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Chen and Lee [37] introduced the concepts of likelihood-based comparison relationships for intervals and subsequently extended them to interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Nevertheless, these likelihoods are defined on interval values or interval type-2 fuzzy sets and cannot be used to handle MCDA problems within the IVIF environment. Therefore, this paper uses the inclusion comparison possibilities proposed by Chen [35] and the likelihood measure proposed by Chen [5] to define certain likelihood-based preference functions and to develop new IVIF permutation methods.Note that the similar concept of likelihood-based preference functions can be found in the likelihood-based outranking method proposed by Chen [43] and the IVIF-PROMETHEE methods proposed by Chen [44]. However, an evident drawback of the methods developed by Chen [43]; Chen [44] is the complex and troublesome mathematical manipulations required. For example, Chen [43] compared all feasible alternatives by pairs based on likelihood-based preference functions to apply the comprehensive preference indices for formation of the Boolean matrix with concordance outranking relationships. Next, Chen used the counter-likelihood-based preference functions and the generalized distance measurement to establish the Boolean matrix with discordance outranking relationships. Subsequently, Chen constructed the global Boolean matrix to obtain partial rankings of the alternatives and used the net concordance index, the net discordance index, and the mean outranking values to obtain complete rankings of the alternatives. In general, rather complicated computational processes must be implemented in the likelihood-based outranking method presented by Chen [43], which would not aid decision makers or analysts in better understanding the crystallized meanings of the mathematical works in the likelihood-based outranking method in practice. A similar observation can be applied to the IVIF-PROMETHEE methods developed by Chen [44]. Chen [44] introduced inclusion-based generalized criteria based on the concepts of inclusion comparison possibilities and proposed extended definitions of leaving flows, entering flows, and net flows to construct relevant measures of the outranking and outranked relationships. In particular, the likelihood-based outranking method and the IVIF-PROMETHEE methods are quite complicated and not easy to implement for decision makers or analysts. Therefore, in contrast to the complex methods in Chen [43]; Chen [44], this paper attempts to develop a simple and effective MCDA method that incorporates the calculation of likelihood-based preference functions.The purpose of this paper is to develop new IVIF permutation methods based on the likelihood-based preference functions for evaluation of all possible permutations of the alternatives that best satisfy given measurements of concordance/discordance. This paper uses the likelihoods of the IVIF preference relationships to construct useful likelihood-based preference functions, i.e., a likelihood-based usual preference function, a likelihood-based quasi-preference function, a likelihood-based linear preference function, a likelihood-based level preference function, a likelihood-based linear preference function with indifference area, and a likelihood-based Gaussian preference function. Instead of identifying the sets of concordance and discordance as in the classical permutation methods, this study directly defines the (weighted) concordance/discordance index for each pair of alternatives at the level of preorder according to each criterion and the ranking corresponding to a specific permutation. The comprehensive concordance/discordance indices and their corresponding score functions are obtained for all permutations of alternatives. Next, the optimal ranking order of the alternatives is obtained by comparing all comprehensive concordance/discordance values. However, it could be difficult to give the exact importance weights or compare the important degrees between criteria in real MCDA problems. Instead, decision makers can supply incomplete and/or certain information [15,45]. To this end, the current paper additionally considers various preference types and develops another IVIF permutation method using programming models to address MCDA problems with incomplete certain information of criterion weights.The proposed IVIF permutation methods use a hybrid approach that integrates the likelihood calculation method, the generalized criteria in the PROMETHEE, and the permutation-based methodology. Nevertheless, the proposed methods are not merely a mixture of these relevant MCDA methods and techniques. Several significant features discriminate the proposed IVIF permutation methods from the existing permutation-based outranking methods in the MCDA field. First, this paper uses the likelihood-based preference functions to measure the levels of concordance and discordance of the complete priority order of the alternatives. Such an approach is definitely different from existing measurements of concordance and discordance in the permutation-based methodology. Second, unlike the traditional concordance/discordance index in the permutation methods (i.e., assigning one to the index if there is concordance and assigning zero to the index if there is discordance), the proposed concordance/discordance index based on likelihood-based preference functions can differentiate among several degrees of concordance and can provide additional decision-aiding information. Third, to provide a flexible and practical treatment of various preference structures, this paper establishes two systematic approaches that address MCDA problems involving the IVIF importance weights and incomplete preference information separately to enrich the IVIF permutation methodology in real-world applications. Overall, the IVIF permutation methods with likelihood-based preference functions are effective and unique compared with previously developed methods.Furthermore, comparisons with different MCDA methods verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods, including comparative analyses with the nonlinear assignment model, the integrated nonlinear programming model, the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS), the interval-valued fuzzy permutation method, and the IF version of the proposed methodology. Finally, this paper applies the proposed methods to an empirical risk assessment problem in new product development (NPD) to provide additional contributions for practical implications. The NPD is a risky process [46,47], and good risk management practice is essential for the success of NPD in decreasing this uncertainty [48]. Thus, the vital issue in NPD is how to select optimal projects for new products [46]. In this paper, empirical study of a risk assessment problem in developing kitchen-stored smartphones is implemented to validate the effectiveness of the current methods in the real world.This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates an MCDA problem based on IVIF sets and introduces the concept of likelihoods of fuzzy preference relationships in the IVIF context. Section 3 presents an IVIF permutation method with the likelihood-based preference functions for handling MCDA problems. Additionally, another approach using programming models is provided to manage decision-making problems with incomplete preference information. Section 4 demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods by applying them to a problem of the selection of bridge construction methods. This section also consists of a comparative analysis with other widely used MCDA methods and discusses the advantages of the proposed methods in additional detail. Section 5 analyzes the empirical data of a risk assessment problem in NPD to examine the validity of the proposed methods in real-world applications. Section 6 presents the conclusions.This section describes an MCDA problem within the IVIF environment and introduces the concept of likelihoods of the IVIF preference relationships.Consider an MCDA problem in which the ratings of alternative evaluations and the importance weights of criteria are expressed as IVIF sets. Define Z={z1, z2, …, zm} as a set of decision alternatives. Define X={x1, x2, …, xn} as a criterion set that contains the criteria by which the alternative performances are measured. The set X can be generally divided into two sets, i.e., Xb (i.e., a collection of benefit criteria) and Xc (i.e., a collection of cost criteria), where Xb∩Xc=∅ and Xb∪Xc=X.Let an IVIF setA˜idenote the characteristic of the alternative zi. Let μijand νijbe closed subintervals of [0,1], with lower and upper boundaries denoted byμij−andμij+andνij−andνij+, respectively. The characteristicA˜iis defined as follows:(1)A˜i={〈xj,(μij,νij)〉|xj∈X}={〈xj,([μij−,μij+],[νij−,νij+])〉|xj∈X},where the expression is subject to the condition0≤μij++νij+≤1. Let an IVIF numberA˜ijdenote the evaluative rating of alternative zi∈Z with respect to criterion xj∈X. The evaluative ratingA˜ijis expressed as follows:(2)A˜ij=(μij,νij)=([μij−,μij+],[νij−,νij+]),whereμij(=[μij−,μij+])andνij(=[νij−,νij+])represent the respective intervals of the membership and non-membership degrees for which alternative ziis evaluated with respect to criterion xj.An IVIF setW˜, which is defined on the universe of discourse X, is an object of the following form:(3)W˜={〈xj,(ωj,ϖj)〉|xj∈X}={〈xj,([ωj−,ωj+],[ϖj−,ϖj+])〉|xj∈X},where the expression is subject to the condition0≤ωj++ϖj+≤1. Let an IVIF numberW˜jdenote the importance weight of criterion xj∈X, andW˜jis represented in the following manner:(4)W˜j=(ωj,ϖj)=([ωj−,ωj+],[ϖj−,ϖj+]),whereωj(=[ωj−,ωj+])andϖj(=[ϖj−,ϖj+])represent the respective intervals of the degrees of importance and unimportance, respectively, of criterion xj.Following the inclusion comparison possibilities proposed by Chen [35] and the likelihood measures proposed by Chen [5], we introduce the concept of likelihoods of the IVIF preference relationships. LetA˜ij=([μij−,μij+],[νij−,νij+])andA˜i′j=([μi′j−,μi′j+],[νi′j−,νi′j+])be two evaluative ratings of alternativeszi,zi′∈Z, respectively, with respect to criterion xj∈X. LetL(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)represent the likelihood thatA˜ijis not smaller thanA˜i′j(i.e.,A˜ij≥A˜i′j). The likelihoodL(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)is defined as follows:(5)L(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)=12(L−(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)+L+(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)),where the lower and upper likelihoodsL−(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)andL+(A˜ij≥A˜i′j), respectively, are computed in the following manner:(6)L−(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)=max1−max(1−νi′j−)−μij−(1−μij−−νij+)+(1−μi′j+−νi′j−),0,0,(7)L+(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)=max1−max(1−νi′j+)−μij+(1−μij+−νij−)+(1−μi′j−−νi′j+),0,0.The likelihoodL(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)satisfies the following useful properties: (i)0≤L(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)≤1; (ii)L(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)=0if1−νij−≤μi′j−; (iii)L(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)=1ifμij−≥1−νi′j−; (iv)L(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)+L(A˜i′j≥A˜ij)=1; and (v)L(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)≥0.5ifL(A˜ij≥A˜i″j)≥0.5andL(A˜i″j≥A˜i′j)≥0.5(i.e., weak transitivity property). Additionally,L−(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)andL+(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)satisfy the following properties: (i)0≤L−(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)≤1; (ii)0≤L+(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)≤1; (iii)L−(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)≤L+(A˜ij≥A˜i′j); and (iv)L−(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)+L+(A˜ij≥A˜i′j)=1. See Chen [5] for detailed proofs.Based on the concept of likelihood-based preference functions, this section presents a new permutation method used to evaluate all possible rankings (permutations) of the alternatives that best satisfy the given measurements of concordance/discordance.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The proposed IVIF permutation methods with likelihood-based preference functions can be easily adopted and applied to practical MCDA problems because of their simple logic and refined computational procedures. Certain likelihood-based preference functions have been developed based on the likelihoods of the IVIF preference relationships. These preference functions constitute the main portion of the proposed permutation-based outranking methodology. Based on the likelihood-based preference functions, certain useful concordance/discordance indices have been presented to facilitate a concordance-discordance analysis of outranking relationships and to evaluate each permutation of the alternatives. Additionally, the proposed methods take into account the particularities of MCDA problems with different preference structures. With respect to the IVIF importance weights, the decision maker can immediately acquire the ranking order of the alternatives using the comprehensive concordance/discordance value derived from the proposed IVIF permutation method with Algorithm I. On the other hand, this paper has constructed two programming models of [M1] (for incomplete information) and [M2] (for incomplete and conflicting information) in the proposed Algorithm II to address the MCDA problems involving non-fuzzy importance weights. Furthermore, this paper has validated the advantages of the proposed IVIF permutation methods with respect to other decision-making methods via the comparisons with the nonlinear assignment model, the integrated nonlinear programming model based on the assignment method, the fuzzy TOPSIS method with Hamming distances or Euclidean distances, the interval-valued fuzzy permutation method, and the IF version of the proposed methodology. The comparisons have demonstrated that the proposed methods are appropriate and effective for managing MCDA problems with uncertain information using IVIF sets. According to the empirical results of the risk assessment problem in NPD, the usefulness and validity of the proposed methods have been demonstrated as well.However, the main drawback of the permutation-based outranking methodology is the requirement of a large amount of calculations. Consider a medium MCDA problem consisting of eight alternatives as an example. The arithmetic computations for all permutations is troublesome because 40,320 (=8!) permutations of the ranking of the alternatives exist. The proposed IVIF permutation methods do not require heavy and complicated computations in the implementation procedure for each permutation Perl. Nevertheless, the number of permutations increases rapidly with an increase in the number of alternatives. Therefore, the limitation of the proposed IVIF permutation methods is the tedious computations required for handling an MCDA problem with a sufficiently large number of alternatives. This feature might limit the application of the proposed methods to small problems only. Although the difficulty of implementing the arithmetic computations for all m! permutations can be evidently overcome with the help of powerful computer hardware, the proposed methods may be not applicable to MCDA problems with large numbers of alternatives in order to avoid tedious computations.
