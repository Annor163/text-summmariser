@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A simulation based computational method was conducted to reflect the effect of intervention for those at high risk of type 2 diabetes. Hierarchy Support Vector Machines (H-SVMs) were used to classify high risk. The proportion transitioning from the high risk state to moderate state, low state or the normal state was calculated. When Body Mass Index (BMI) decreased by 5% (weight loss 3–5kg), the proportion of Class A transferring to a lower state was 15–25%, and risk also appeared reduced for Class B1. In Class C, when cholesterol (CHOL) was decreased by 2.5% (0.13–0.34mmol/L), 10–25% transitioned to a lower risk state. The method could help determine risk transition by the adjustment of sensitive risk factors. This might provide the basis for implementing intervention in cases in a high risk state.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Type 2 diabetes is a serious and expensive disease. Lifestyle intervention is effective and cost-effective from the perspective of the health system and society [1]. It is widely recognized that the incidence of type 2 diabetes is high and increasing gradually throughout the world. In order to predict the effect of intervention at the initial stage, simulated computational research was conducted. This research could provide effective guidance and improve the efficiency of intervention. Recent research demonstrates that the risk of type 2 diabetes can be reduced by successful lifestyle intervention [2–4]. Interventions such as weight loss and enhanced physical activity are significant predictors of risk reduction [5,6].Lifestyle modification focused on modest weight loss (5–10%) and moderately intense physical activity could significantly reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes (by 58%, as shown in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)) and cardiometabolic risk factors in high-risk individuals [7,8]. The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends strategies for the prevention of type 2 diabetes, which has a strong association with obesity [10]. Several intervention studies, in China (“Da-Qing Study”) [11,12], in Europe (“Malmo study” [13,14], “Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study” [15–17]) and in the United States (“Diabetes Prevention Program”) [18] have shown that lifestyle changes were able to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by around 50% among at-risk individuals. Rautio [19] assessed the predictors of success with lifestyle intervention (weight loss ≥5% and improved glucose tolerance) in individuals at high risk in a 1-year follow-up in a primary health care setting. The intervention period required a long time, usually six months to one year, or even much longer, until the study period was finished, before the effect of the intervention could be known.The aim of this study was to simulate the effect of intervention in those at high risk of type 2 diabetes. According to their present health status, sensitive risk factors were adjusted, and the effect of intervention was simulated. At the same time, the importance of the sensitive risk factors was verified. This research could supply predictions of the effect of intervention in the early stages of intervention implementation. That might help to give effective guidance, improve the efficiency of the intervention, and save money.The research was undertaken on 59,839 cross-sectional health examination records in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Mining Bureau and Public Security Bureau in Beijing, Xi׳an, Wuxi and Anyang in China from 2001 to 2008. The 59,839 cases included 34,377 men (57.40%) and 25,462 women (42.60%), all adults aged 20–84 years without diabetes. The outcome without diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of the 1997 criteria [20]. The specific distribution of subjects judged by gender and age is presented inTable 1. The validation data came from the Beijing Hospital Medical Center, including 1132 high risk subjects in 2007 and 2008, consisting of 59% men and 41% women. The validation data were independent of the experimental data.The high risk state was identified using the risk state determination (RSD) system which was available at http://www.isclab.org/rsd/RSDAssess.php. The high risk criteria are shown inTable 2. A schematic diagram of the RSD system is shown inFig. 1. In the RSD system, the inputs were risk factors such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Cholesterol (CHOL), Triglyceride (TG), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), age, etc., and the output was the risk state. The 6-year follow-up test result of the RSD system is given inTable 3. Four risk states were determined using RSD, including high risk, moderate risk, low risk and the normal state, as shown inTables 4 and5.The distribution of high risk subjects by gender and age is shown inTable 6.
