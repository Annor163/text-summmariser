@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, the physical and chemical characteristics, biological structure and function of a non-specific nuclease from Yersinia enterocolitica subsp. palearctica (Y. NSN) found in our group were studied using multiple bioinformatics approaches. The results showed that Y. NSN had 283 amino acids, a weight of 30,692.5ku and a certain hydrophilic property. Y. NSN had a signal peptide, no transmembrane domains and disulphide bonds. Cleavage site in Y. NSN was between pos. 23 and 24. The prediction result of the secondary structure showed Y. NSN was a coil structure-based protein. The ratio of α-helix, β-folded and random coil were 18.73%, 16.96% and 64.31%, respectively. Active sites were pos. 124, 125, 127, 157, 165 and 169. Mg2+ binding site was pos. 157. Substrate binding sites were pos. 124, 125 and 169. The analysis of multisequencing alignment and phylogenetic tree indicated that Y. NSN shared high similarity with the nuclease from Y. enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica 8081. The enzyme activity results showed that Y. NSN was a nuclease with good thermostability.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Nuclease is a class of enzymes that can degrade DNA and/or RNA molecules by cleaving the phosphodiester bonds that link adjacent nucleotides. According to consensus criteria, nucleases can be classified into RNase, DNase, and non-specific nuclease. Non-specific nucleases can attack both DNA and RNA in the presence of Mg2+ or other bivalent cations (Li et al., 2005). Various non-specific nucleases, such as Serratia marcescens nuclease that is one of the best-studied non-specific nuclease (Friedhoff et al., 1994, 1996, 1999; Miller and Krause, 1996; Miller et al., 1994; Shlyapnikov et al., 2000, 2002), nuclease from white spot syndrome virus (Li et al., 2005), and mitochondrial EndoG that is a sugar non-specific nuclease (Schäfer et al., 2004), have been reported.Protein structure, function and biological properties of Y. NSN are very important for its industrial applications. In biotechnology field, bioinformatics can be used as a tool to process biological data and provide answers to some biological questions. It has been playing an important role in analyzing sequences of nucleic acids and proteins, and predicting the characteristics of protein structure and function (Ouyang et al., 2009; Bai et al., 2012; Yang and Shang, 2007). Bai et al. (2012) studied the physical and chemical characteristics, signal peptide, transmembrane domain and topological structure of a novel protein TgIMP1 through bioinformatics methods. Hu et al. (2013) found that the second thermonuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (Nuc2) was a more conserved protein when compared with the first thermonuclease from S. aureus (Nuc1) by sequence alignment and phylogenetic methods.Yersinia enterocolitica is a common food-borne pathogen which can cause yersiniosis in humans (Hanifian and Khani, 2012). It has been paid much attention due to the cause of intestinal infectious disease outbreak. A non-specific nuclease from Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica (Y. NSN) has been found in our group. Therefore, in this study, bioinformatics method was used to analyze and predict protein structure and function, including hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, signal peptide, transmembrane structure, secondary structure, structure domain and the three dimensional structure. Meanwhile, the evolution relationship of the nucleases was studied by the analysis of multisequencing alignment and phylogenetic tree. Thermostability of the available nucleases was also investigated. It is the first report on the study of the characteristics of structure and function from Y. NSN using bioinformatics methods.The gene sequence and amino acids sequence of Y. NSN were obtained from the GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The accession numbers are FR729477.2 and YP_006005337.1, respectively.The bioinformatics web sites and software used in this study are showed in Table 1. The nucleases for the analysis of multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree are shown in Table 2.Enzyme activity was determined by the degradation degree of DNA. Approximately 2.0μl of diluted enzyme solution was incubated in 36μl DNA of calf thymus (100ng/μl) as a substrate. After incubation at 37°C for 5min, the reaction was stopped by adding 8.0μl of 6× DNA loading buffer (10mM Tris–HCl, 60mM EDTA, 40% sucrose, 0.05% bromophenol blue, pH 7.6). The reaction products were then subjected to 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. The degradation degree of nucleic acid could be visualized and calculated by staining with 0.25μg/ml ethidium bromide.
