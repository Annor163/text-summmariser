Effect of ultrasounds on neurons and microglia: Cell viability and automatic analysis of cell morphology

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Neurons and microglial cells are treated with ultrasounds and differences in cell proliferation and morphology are evaluated in comparison to control untreated cells.Cell proliferation is evaluated by standard viability assay while cell morphology required the development of a special algorithm.Results showed that in ultrasound-treated cells, the number of elongations as well as their maximum length and their mean length were significantly increased in comparison to control untreated cells.Our data show that ultrasounds induce cell differentiation affecting cell morphology as well as the ability of neurons and microglia to form complex networks.Our results suggest the possibility of using ultrasounds to reconstitute neuronal and microglial circuits commonly altered in many neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Ultrasounds, besides their well-established medical imaging role, influence the homeostasis of complex anatomical systems including the physiology of neurons and glia and the permeability of the blood brain barrier. In this study, neurons and microglial cells were treated with ultrasounds (commonly used in diagnostics) and differences in cell proliferation and morphology were evaluated in comparison to control, untreated cells. Cell proliferation was evaluated by standard viability assessment, while the quantitative analysis of cell morphology, usually performed by edge and line detection algorithms, required the development of a new special algorithm. In fact, traditional software methodologies do not provide the appropriate tools for morphological analysis of neurons and microglial cells, typically characterized by a roughly triangular body and numerous elongations of different lengths resulting in a complex neuron–microglia network. This new method, based on a modified Hough Transform algorithm using a matching operator instead of the common gradient filter, enabled the automatic identification of cell elongations and branches, the extraction of related information, and the comparison of the data between control and treated neurons, as well as microglial cells.Results, based on the development of the new algorithm, showed that in ultrasound-treated cells, the number of elongations, as well as their maximum and mean lengths, increased significantly in comparison to control, untreated cells.These results were consistent with the standard microscopic evaluation. Furthermore, a significant correlation between cell morphology and proliferation suggested that ultrasounds induced cell differentiation affecting cell morphology, as well as the ability of neurons and microglial cells to form complex networks. Our results suggest the possibility of using ultrasounds, currently utilized in diagnostics, to reconstitute neuronal and microglial circuits that are often altered in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The incidence of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders is on the rise worldwide for a variety of reasons ranging from population ageing to exposure to toxicants [1,2]. The enormous and increasing disease burden of these disorders raises the urgency to understand the underlying causes, as well as to develop efficient treatments.Several approaches and numerous drugs exist to protect or restore the normal function of central nervous system (CNS), and to increase viability of neurons, glial cells and complex neuronal networks impaired in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. Unfortunately, their therapeutic efficacy is often limited because of side effects [3].Recent data have shown that ultrasonography, and in particular focused ultrasounds, positively affect the blood–brain barrier [4]. These observations led us to hypothesize that the non-focused ultrasounds, currently used in the field of medical diagnostics, may elicit positive effects on cell differentiation, as well as on the morphology and connectivity of those cells of the CNS impaired in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. Neuronal and glial connectivity, as well as the complex neuronal network in the CNS, represent the disorders main areas of concern in these conditions [5]. Within the scientific literature, only a few studies examine the effects of ultrasounds on the functional connectivity and neuron–glia networks in the CNS [6]. Furthermore, due to the complexity of the interaction between neurons and glial cells, as well as the highly particular shape of these cells, we required more reliable and efficient in vitro methods to objectively analyse and assess neuronal and glial connectivity.With the aim of evaluating the effects of ultrasounds on cell morphology and on the interactions between neurons and microglial cells, we developed an automated image analysis method focused on the detection and analysis of cellular elongations. We validated the results of this new automated methodology by comparison to standard visual morphological evaluation. Furthermore, we assessed the effects of a common ultrasound treatment on the proliferation of neurons and microglial cells in vitro. These results correlated with standard and automated morphological evaluations.Unlike other cell types, neurons and microglial cells possess a roughly triangular body and numerous branched elongations of different lengths creating very complex networks. For these reasons, the standard quantitative image analysis softwares for cell morphology based on edge and line detection algorithms are inaccurate and unreliable for the morphological study of the neurons, glial cells, and their interconnections.The earliest attempts to develop automated detection and analysis of cells in cyto-histological specimens date back a few decades [7]. Various different approaches exist ranging from relatively simple threshold techniques, to more sophisticated model-based methods using a priori information on cell shape features to obtain a separation of cell clusters and a cell/nucleus segmentation in microscopic images [8]. Some of those methods used are Markov random fields [9], stepwise merging rules and gradient vector flow snake [10], and combined fuzzy clustering with multiphase vector level sets [11]. These various methodologies exemplify the diversity used to tackle this complex problem [12]. Recently, the automated image analysis of cells has received increased attention especially in biomedical research and clinical pathology. While qualitative and semi-quantitative visual inspections of morphological features are considered the standard approach in diagnostics and research, cyto-histological analyses for the evaluation of the stage of a disease or its response to treatment now require accurate and valid standardized quantitative assessment [13].In the case of cells of the nervous system, cellular image analysis should focus on the identification and morphology of the cellular outline (more than that of the nuclei). Importantly, the cytoplasmic elongations of neurons and glial cells forming complex circuits have a deep functional relevance since their loss, or decrease, is involved in numerous neuropathologies [14,15].The approach of our automated image analysis method presented and discussed in this paper, employs a modified Hough Transform algorithm incorporating a matching operator instead of the common gradient filter. This new algorithm efficiently enables the automatic identification and evaluation of a cell's branched elongations. This then permitted the analysis of the related information, including the comparison of the data between controls and ultrasound-treated samples.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Ultrasonography induces neuro-physiological changes, which could be exploited in the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders [19] including those of the autism spectrum [5]. This study's novel, reliable, and efficient automatic method for morphological analysis of the complex neuron–glia connectivity, supports and provides a cellular rationale for previous in vivo observations of the therapeutic effect of ultrasounds on injured brain.Because of the rising incidence of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases, a safe, effective, non-invasive and easily available procedure such as ultrasonography, may contribute to significant advances and benefits in therapies for these pathologies. Our results suggest that treatment with ultrasounds, comparable for exposure time and acoustic intensity to conventional ultrasound imaging procedures performed for diagnostic purposes, and thus fully compatible with regulatory safety limits, might represent a potential tool in neurotherapeutics [20].Fundings supporting this study derive from the University of Florence and from Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze, Italy.
