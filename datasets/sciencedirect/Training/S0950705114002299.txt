@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Theory of belief function can be introduced to the interval set by defining interval-valued belief structures. The Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory of evidence has been extended to combine interval-valued belief structures for decades. Although there already exist several combination approaches proposed by previous researchers, this problem has not been fully resolved so far. A novel combination of interval-valued belief structures is developed after analyzing existing irrational or suboptimal approaches. The novel combination approach is modeled based on intuitionistic fuzzy set, rather than nonlinear programming models, which are computational complicated. Numerical examples are implemented to illustrate the performance of the proposed novel approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since it was firstly presented by Dempster [1], and was later extended and refined by Shafer [2], the Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence, or the D–S theory for short, has generated considerable interest. Its application has extended to many areas such as expert systems [3], diagnosis and reasoning [4,5], pattern classification [6–9], information fusion [10], knowledge reduction [11], global positioning system [12], regression analysis [13], and data mining [14]. However, for its counterintuitive results in some cases, especially when there is high conflict among bodies of evidence, various alternatives to D–S theory have been presented [15–22].The original D–S theory requires precise belief degrees and belief structures, whereas in practice some or all probability masses can be uncertain or imprecise. Such uncertainty or imprecision may be caused by the incompleteness, the lack of information, linguistic ambiguity or vagueness. For example, in the problem of pattern recognition, a classifier may be unable to give a precise decision about the unknown pattern, and even worse, its belief degree on each class may be imprecise. In this case, an interval-valued belief degree rather than a precise one may be provided. In the group decision making, different experts may give different degrees of belief. Of course these degrees can be averaged to get a real valued estimate, but this leads inevitably to the loss of some important information. Therefore, the use of interval-valued belief degree seems to be a sensible option. This would preserve the different belief degrees, thereby facilitating further discussion. So we can say that interval-valued belief structures represent the belief information which is known but not precise. Hence the problem of extending D–S theory to interval-values belief function arises.There have been several attempts to extend the D–S theory to interval-valued belief structures [24,42]. However, the issues of combination and normalization of interval-valued belief structures have not been fully resolved. One apparent drawback existing in the previous approach is the violation of associativity, which is crucial for multi-evidence combination. Besides, the process of nonlinear optimization may bring additional computational burden. The purpose of this paper is to reinvestigate the issues and to develop a novel approach for combining interval-valued belief structures. This approach, satisfying the associative requirement, is founded based on intuitionistic fuzzy set, in a relative simple way.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief recall of the D–S theory of evidence, together with introductions of interval-valued belief structure and operations on interval values. In Section 3, we review and critically analyze the existing approaches for combining and normalizing interval-valued belief structures and point out the drawbacks of these methods. A novel approach for combining interval-valued belief structures is developed in Section 4. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the performance of the novel approach in Section 5. We come to the conclusion of this paper in Section 6.
