@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes a novel unambiguous correlation function for composite binary offset carrier (CBOC) signal tracking based on partial correlations. In the proposed scheme, first, we partition sub-carriers of the CBOC signal into partial sub-carriers, and subsequently, we obtain partial correlations by correlating the partial sub-carriers with the received CBOC signal. Finally, a novel unambiguous correlation function with no side-peak is constructed by combining the partial correlations in a specially designed way. Unlike the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme does not require any auxiliary signal and from numerical results, it is found to offer a better tracking performance than those of the conventional schemes in terms of the tracking error standard deviation (TESD) and multipath error envelope (MEE).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Because of increasing demands for more precise positioning services, various global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) have been developed [1]. Especially, in order to operate a GNSS independent from the global positioning system (GPS), European Space Agency has developed a GNSS referred to as Galileo. Although the original binary offset carrier (BOC) signal was considered as the modulation signal for Galileo, the CBOC signal was finally adopted in Galileo E1 band in 2006, since it provides an improved signal tracking performance compared with the original BOC signal and enables Galileo signals to share the frequency band with GPS signals [2]. The CBOC signal is a weighted sum of two BOC signals, BOC(x, 1) and BOC(y, 1) and is denoted by CBOC(x, y, γ), where BOC( ·, ·) represents a BOC signal generated by multiplying a pseudorandom noise (PRN) code and a sine-phased sub-carrier signal, γ is a power split ratio between BOC(x, 1) and BOC(y, 1), and ‘x’ or ‘y’ is the ratio of the chip periodTc=1/(1.023×106)of the PRN code to the period of the sub-carrier. Specifically, the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal is used in Galileo [2].The main drawback of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal is that its autocorrelation has multiple side-peaks around the main-peak, causing an ambiguity problem (i.e., the signal synchronization is completed on one of the side peaks). Thus, so far, various unambiguous schemes have been proposed for the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal acquisition (coarse synchronization) [3–11] and tracking (fine synchronization) [12–24], of which the latter is dealt with in this paper. Authors [12–17] proposed unambiguous tracking methods for the BOC signal, and so, they are not appropriate for the CBOC signal. In [18,19], side-peak cancellation schemes were presented; however, their tracking performances are worse than that of the CBOC autocorrelation. Although improved unambiguous tracking methods using various auxiliary signals were proposed in [20–22], the improvement in tracking performance over the conventional autocorrelation is not significant, and also, the auxiliary signals increase the system complexity. Ren et al. [23] and Shen et al. [24] proposed tracking structures that do not use the autocorrelation, and thus, are free from the side-peaks; however, they have much worse tracking performances than that of the autocorrelation-based tracking.In this paper, a novel unambiguous correlation function with a sharper main-peak is proposed to provide a better performance than those of the conventional schemes in CBOC signal tracking. Specifically, we partition the sub-carrier into partial sub-carriers, and subsequently, correlate the partial sub-carriers with the received CBOC signal, yielding partial correlations. Then, the partial correlations are combined in a specially designed way to construct an unambiguous correlation function. The proposed unambiguous correlation function is demonstrated to provide a better tracking performance than those of the conventional schemes without requiring any auxiliary signal. Although a partial correlation-based method was used in [19] also, the corresponding divide and recombination method is for BOC signals, and thus, is not appropriate for CBOC signals composed of a weighted sum of two different BOC signals, as we shall see in Sections 3 and 4.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal model. In Section 3, we propose a novel unambiguous correlation function with no side-peak. Section 4 compares the tracking performances of the proposed and conventional schemes, and finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.The CBOC signal c(t) can be expressed as(1)c(t)=P∑i=−∞∞hirTc(t−iTc)d(t)psc(t),where P is the signal power,hi∈{−1,1}is the ith chip of a PRN code with a periodT,0.35em0exrα(t)denotes the unit rectangular pulse over[0,α),0.35em0exTcis the chip period of the PRN code, d(t) denotes the navigation data, and psc(t) is the square wave sub-carrier. We assume that a pilot channel for tracking is provided so that no data modulation is present during the tracking process (i.e.,d(t)=1). For the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal, the sub-carrier psc(t) is a weighted sum of the sub-carrierpscα(t)of the BOC(1,1) signal and the sub-carrierpscβ(t)of the BOC(6,1) signal with the power split ratio of 1/11, and thus, it is expressed as(2)psc(t)=1011pscα(t)−111pscβ(t),wherepscα(t)=∑l=01(−1)lrTsα(t−iTc−lTsα)andpscβ(t)=∑m=011(−1)mrTsβ(t−iTc−mTsβ)withTsα=Tc/2andTsβ=Tc/12denoting the sub-carrier pulse periods of BOC(1,1) and BOC(6,1), respectively.The sub-carrier of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal is shown in the left-hand side of Fig. 1, where the CBOC(6,1,1/11) sub-carrier consists of 12 rectangular pulses and each of which has a width ofTsβ(i.e., Tc/12). Thus, to generate partial correlations with a narrow peak, we unevenly partition the sub-carrier psc(t) as follows:(3)psc(t)=∑m=03pm(t),where pm(t) is the mth partitioned sub-carrier as depicted in the right-hand side of Fig. 1 and{pm(t)}m=03will be used to generate partial correlation functions in the next section.The CBOC(6,1,1/11) autocorrelation shown in the left-hand side of Fig. 2can be expressed as(4)R(τ)=1PT∫0Tc(t)c(t+τ)dt=∑m=03∑i=−∞∞1TP∫0Tc(t)hirTc(t+τ−iTc)pm(t+τ)dt=∑m=03Pm(τ),where Pm(τ) is the mth partial correlation between the CBOC signal c(t) and pm(t). The partial correlations P1(τ) and P2(τ) have the zero-crossing points at Tc/24 and−Tc/24, respectively, since the pulse durations of partitioned sub-carriers p1(t) and p2(t) are the same as that of the BOC(6,1) signal. Now, we can make the following observation: P1(τ)P2(τ) ≤ 0 in the interval of |τ| ≥ Tc/24. Using this observation and the arithmetic property|x|+|y|−|x−y|=0for xy ≤ 0 and|x|+|y|−|x−y|>0otherwise, we can obtain an unambiguous correlation function(5)N0(τ)=|P1(τ)|+|P2(τ)|−|P1(τ)−P2(τ)|,as shown in the right-hand side of Fig. 2, which consists of only a main-peak with a height of 0.257 and a half-width of Tc/24.Although the unambiguous correlation function N0(τ) has no side-peak, N0(τ) uses only a part (i.e., P1(τ) and P2(τ)) of partial correlations{Pm(τ)}m=03, and thus, the height of the main-peak is much smaller than that of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) autocorrelation, which may lead to a poor tracking performance. Correlating P0(τ) and P3(τ) with N0(τ), thus, we obtain additional unambiguous correlation functions(6){N1(τ)=|P0(τ)|+|N0(τ)|−|P0(τ)−N0(τ)|,N2(τ)=|P3(τ)|+|N0(τ)|−|P3(τ)−N0(τ)|,as shown in the right-hand side of Fig. 2, and finally, we propose an unambiguous correlation function(7)Rproposed(τ)=∑m=02Nm(τ),by summing upN0(τ),0.35em0exN1(τ), and N2(τ). The main-peak height of the proposed unambiguous correlation function is approximately 1.312, which is larger than that of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) autocorrelation, and the main-peak half-width equals to Tc/24, which is much narrower than those of the conventional schemes including the CBOC autocorrelation. The whole process for generating the proposed unambiguous correlation function is depicted in Fig. 3.Fig. 4 shows the correlation functions of the proposed and conventional schemes for the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal where the autocorrelation is included as a reference. From the figure, we can confirm that the proposed unambiguous correlation function does not contain any side-peak, and moreover, has the sharpest main-peak. Thus, we can anticipate that the proposed unambiguous correlation function would outperform the conventional unambiguous correlation functions in tracking performance.For CBOC signal tracking, the proposed correlation function is finally applied to the delay lock loop (DLL), yielding the discriminator output(8)D(τ)=Rproposed2(τ+Δ2)−Rproposed2(τ−Δ2),where Δ is the early-late spacing in the DLL. Fig. 5shows the discriminator outputs of the conventional and proposed correlation functions for CBOC(6,1,1/11) (note that [23,24] are not correlation-based schemes, and so, do not have their correlation functions). From this figure, it is observed that the slope of the proposed unambiguous correlation function is much steeper than those of the conventional ones in the tracking range aroundτ=0, and thus again, it is expected that the proposed unambiguous correlation function would exhibit a better tracking performance over the conventional ones.In this section, we develop an extension of the proposed scheme based on the observation that the width of an unambiguous correlation function depends on the duration of partitioned sub-carriers. Thus, to generate a narrower correlation function, we evenly partition the sub-carrier psc(t) as follows:(9)psc(t)=∑n=012q−1pnex(t),wherepnex(t)is the nth sub-carrier with a duration of Tc/12q as depicted in Fig. 6.The CBOC autocorrelation can be expressed as(10)R(τ)=1PT∫0Tc(t)c(t+τ)dt=∑n=012q−1∑i=−∞∞1TP∫0Tc(t)hirTc(t+τ−iTc)pnex(t+τ)dt=∑n=012q−1Pnex(τ),wherePnex(τ)is the nth partial correlation between the CBOC signal c(t) andpnex(t). The zero-crossing points ofP6q−1ex(τ)andP6qex(τ)are Tc/24q and−Tc/24q, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 7.By using (5), we can obtain an unambiguous correlation function(11)N0ex(τ)=|P6q−1ex(τ)|+|P6qex(τ)|−|P6q−1ex(τ)−P6qex(τ)|,as shown in the right-hand side of Fig. 7, which consists of only a main peak with a half-width of Tc/24q. By using (6), we construct two additional unambiguous correlation functions(12){N1ex(τ)=∑i=06q−2|Piex(τ)|+|N0ex(τ)|−|Piex(τ)−N0ex(τ)|,N2ex(τ)=∑i=6q+112q−1|Piex(τ)|+|N0ex(τ)|−|Piex(τ)−N0ex(τ)|,and finally, we construct an extended proposed unambiguous correlation function as(13)Rproposedex(τ)=∑i=02Niex(τ),by using (7). The whole process for generating the extended proposed unambiguous correlation function is shown in Fig. 8.Fig. 9 shows the correlation functions of the proposed scheme (referred as unambiguous CBOC correlation function (UCCF)) and the extended proposed scheme (referred as high-accuracy unambiguous CBOC correlation function (H-UCCF)) for CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal. From the figure, we can confirm that the H-UCCF (13) has a sharper main-peak than the UCCF (7). Thus, we can anticipate that the H-UCCF would outperform the UCCF.It should be mentioned that the proposed schemes are applicable to the time-multiplexed BOC(6,1,1/11) (TMBOC(6,1,1/11)) signal composed of two different BOC signals like the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal. Yet, since the proposed schemes have been originally proposed for the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal without considering the characteristics of the TMBOC(6,1,1/11) signal, a better unambiguous tracking technique may exist for the TMBOC(6,1,1/11) signal. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are based on not a theoretical analysis but an observation, and thus, they may not be the best solution in resolving the ambiguity problem of the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal either, although they have been developed according to the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal characteristics. Thus, it would be an interesting task to develop an unambiguous technique based on a theoretical analysis and compare it with the conventional schemes, which we would like to reserve for another paper in the future.The tracking performances of the proposed and conventional tracking schemes are compared in terms of the TESD defined asσG2BLTI, where σ is the standard deviation of the discriminator whenτ=0,0.35em0exBLis the bandwidth of the loop filter, TIis the integration time, and G is the discriminator gain [19]. For simulations, we assume the following parameters:BL=1Hz,TI=4ms,T=TI,Tc−1=1.023MHz,q=1, andΔ=Tc24,Tc36, andTc48. In addition, optimized parameters of [20–22,24] are used for simulations of [20–22,24] in this paper (i.e., the best tracking performances of [20–22,24] are compared with other schemes including the proposed scheme).Fig. 10 shows the TESD performances of the UCCF, H-UCCF, and conventional correlation functions as a function of the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) defined as P/W0 with W0 the noise power spectral density whenΔ=Tc24,0.35em0exTc36, andTc48. From the figure, we can see that the UCCF and H-UCCF provide a better TESD performance than the conventional correlation functions over the CNR range 20–40dBHz of practical interest. Specifically, the UCCF and H-UCCF give a performance improvement of more than 2dBHz and 8dBHz, respectively, over all of the conventional correlation functions in the CNR range of practical interest. This is due to the fact that the UCCF and H-UCCF have sharper main-peaks than the conventional correlation functions. In addition, as expected, it is observed that the H-UCCF performs better than the UCCF: The former provides a performance improvement of more than 5dBHz over the latter.Fig. 11shows the TESD performances of the UCCF and autocorrelation function, for CBOC(4,1,1/11) and CBOC(6,1,1/11) whenΔ=Tc24. From the figure, it is observed that the UCCF provides a better TESD performance than the autocorrelation function over the CNR range 20–40dBHz of practical interest for CBOC(6,1,1/11) and CBOC(4,1,1/11). Specifically, the UCCF gives a performance improvement of more than 2dBHz and 3dBHz for CBOC(6,1,1/11) and CBOC(4,1,1/11), respectively, which implies that the proposed scheme should be useful for various families of CBOC signals that might be adopted in the future.Fig. 12shows the MEE performances of the UCCF, H-UCCF, and conventional correlation functions whenΔ=Tc24and the amplitude ratios of the second path to the first path are 0.1 and 0.25, where we can observe that the UCCF and H-UCCF provide a better MEE performance than [18–22] over the range (0 ∼ 1.5Tc) of the multipath delay of practical interest, whereas the UCCF and H-UCCF generally perform worse than [23,24] although they exhibit a better MEE performance than [23,24] over the range (0 ∼ 0.02Tc) of the multipath delay.These observations become more pronounced in Fig. 13showing the areas of the MEEs (A-MEEs) [25] of the UCCF, H-UCCF, and conventional correlation functions, where we can see that the UCCF and H-UCCF have smaller A-MEEs than [18–22] by a factor of 1.2–20.0, whereas they have larger A-MEEs than [23,24] by a factor of 20.8–88.4. It should be noted that [23,24] were developed with a focus on improving the MEE performance, and thus, provide a better MEE performance than the UCCF and H-UCCF, while they have an even much worse TESD performance than the UCCF and H-UCCF as shown in Fig. 10.Since the proposed scheme employs multiple partial correlations, it involves an increase in complexity compared with the autocorrelation function. Specifically, the proposed correlation function requires12q0.35em0ex(q≥1)correlators as shown in (10), whereas the autocorrelation needs a single correlator. Considering that (10) can be expressed as(14)1PT∑n=012q−1[∑j=0T/Tc−1∫(12qj+n)(Ts/q)(12qj+n+1)(Ts/q)c(t)c(t+τ)dt],fortunately, the number of correlators can be reduced to one by using a moving sampler as depicted in Fig. 14, where the CBOC sub-carrier correlation is sampled every Ts/q seconds, and then, T/Tcsamples are collected and summed in each of the 12q branches, yielding the 12q partial correlations. However, due to the absolute value operations involved in the proposed scheme, the increase in complexity is not completely resolved, and thus, the authors would like to reserve the issue for future works.
