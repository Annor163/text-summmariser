@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The problem of designing smoothly rounded right-angle corners with Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves is addressed. AG1corner can be uniquely specified as a single PH cubic segment, closely approximating a circular arc. Similarly, aG2corner can be uniquely constructed with a single PH quintic segment having a unimodal curvature distribution. To obtainG2corners incorporating shape freedoms that permit a fine tuning of the curvature profile, PH curves of degree 7 are required. It is shown that degree 7 PH curves define a one-parameter family ofG2corners, facilitating precise control over the extremum of the unimodal curvature distribution, within a certain range of the parameter. As an alternative, aG2corner construction based upon splicing together two PH quintic segments is proposed, that provides two free parameters for shape adjustment. The smooth corner shapes constructed through these schemes can exploit the computational advantages of PH curves, including exact computation of arc length, rational offset curves, and real-time interpolator algorithms for motion control in manufacturing, robotics, inspection, and similar applications.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The problem of “smoothly rounding” the sharp corners of a nominal shape is a key requirement in many geometric design contexts. In consumer products or architectural design, for example, rounded corners are often preferred on the basis of aesthetic or ergonomic considerations. The rounding or “filleting” of sharp corners in load-bearing mechanical components plays a critical role in minimizing stress concentration effects, and thus prolonging fatigue life. In the layout of highways or railways, the precise variation of curvature along a turn between linear segments determines the maximum safe traversal speed, due to the instantaneous centripetal acceleration it incurs.The focus of this study is on the design ofG2corner shapes with planar Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves, a family of curves compatible with the standard Bézier/B-spline representations of modern CAD systems, that offer attractive computational advantages over “ordinary” polynomial curves (Farouki, 2008). Despite its ubiquitous applications, this “corner rounding” problem does not appear to have received much attention. Walton and Meek (2009) formulated a scheme forG2blending of the corners on polygonal curves using “ordinary” cubic and PH quintic segments. The uniqueG2PH quintic corner described in Section 4 below may be regarded as a special case of this scheme, but it offers no residual degrees freedoms for fine-tuning the corner shape.A substantial literature on design of “spiral segments” has accumulated (Baass, 1984; Habib and Sakai, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012; Hartman, 1957; Meek and Walton, 1992; Walton and Meek, 1996a) including the use of PH curves (Farouki, 1997; Habib and Sakai, 2007; Walton and Meek, 1996b, 1998, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2013) in this context. However, spiral segments are not directly applicable to the corner rounding problem, since they have monotone curvature variation, and aG2rounded corner shape must incorporate vanishing end-point curvatures. It is, in principle, possible to construct aG2rounded corner shape by splicing spiral PH curve segments together.11Such a solution is presented in Section 6 below.But a single-segment solution, which isG∞over its interior, is obviously preferable whenever possible.The solution procedure (and the analysis of the existence of solutions) is much simpler if the PH curve corner-rounding problem is addressed directly, rather than as an application of existing spiral-segment methods. Invoking the complex representation of planar PH curves, it is shown thatG2rounded corners with the desired symmetry and unimodal curvature properties can be constructed using little more than the solutions of quadratic equations. For brevity, the focus of this study is on rounding right-angle corners (the case of most practical importance). However, the methods can be extended without undue complication to the case of corners with acute or obtuse angles.The plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the construction and basic properties of planar PH curves, and their advantageous features in the corner rounding problem. The simplest solution, theG1PH cubic corner, is then derived in Section 3, and is found to be unique and to closely approximate a circular arc. Quintic PH curves are necessary to obtain aG2corner, and in Section 4 it is observed that theG2PH quintic corner is also unique, with a unimodal curvature distribution. Proceeding to degree 7 PH curves in Section 5, aG2corner incorporating one free parameter is constructed. The curvature remains unimodal over a certain range of this parameter, which can be exploited to fine tune the extremum curvature. As an alternative, anotherG2scheme based on splicing together two PH quintic curves is described in Section 6, that provides two free parameters for shape adjustment. Finally, Section 7 summarizes the main results of this study and identifies some possible topics for further investigation.A planar polynomial Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curver(ξ)=(x(ξ),y(ξ))is characterized by the fact that its derivative componentsx′(ξ),y′(ξ)satisfy (Farouki and Sakkalis, 1990) the Pythagorean condition(1)x′2(ξ)+y′2(ξ)=σ2(ξ)for some polynomialσ(ξ), which defines the parametric speed ofr(ξ), i.e., the rate of changeds/dξof arc length s with respect to the curve parameter ξ. The fact thatσ(ξ)is a polynomial (rather than the square root of a polynomial) endows PH curves with several attractive computational properties.For a primitive curve – i.e.,gcd(x′(ξ),y′(ξ))=constant– a sufficient and necessary condition for satisfaction of (1) is thatx′(ξ)andy′(ξ)should be expressible in terms of polynomialsu(ξ),v(ξ)in the formx′(ξ)=u2(ξ)−v2(ξ),y′(ξ)=2u(ξ)v(ξ).This structure is captured by the complex representation (Farouki, 1994), in which a PH curve of degreen=2m+1is generated from a degree-m complex polynomial(2)w(ξ)=u(ξ)+iv(ξ)=∑k=0mwk(mk)(1−ξ)m−kξkwith Bernstein coefficientswk=uk+ivkby integration of the expression(3)r′(ξ)=w2(ξ).The parametric speed, unit tangent, and curvature ofr(ξ)may be formulated (Farouki, 1994) in terms ofw(ξ)as(4)σ(ξ)=|w(ξ)|2,t(ξ)=w2(ξ)σ(ξ),κ(ξ)=2Im(w¯(ξ)w′(ξ))σ2(ξ).As noted above, the parametric speed is a polynomial, while the unit tangent and curvature22The numerator and denominator ofκ(ξ)are of degree2m−2and 4m, respectively.are rational functions of ξ. The unit normaln(ξ)=t(ξ)×z, where z is a unit vector orthogonal to the plane, is also rational. Sinceσ(ξ)is a polynomial, the cumulative arc lengths(ξ)=∫0ξσ(t)dtis also a polynomial in ξ. Moreover, the offset curvesrd(ξ)=r(ξ)+dn(ξ)at each distance d can be exactly represented as rational curves.To construct smooth PH curve corner shapes, it is convenient to adopt a standardized coordinate system. Solutions obtained in this system can be transformed to specific model coordinates through a suitable combination of scaling, translation, and rotation transformations. A canonicalG2corner is defined as a smooth curve, with initial and final positions, unit tangents, and curvatures specified bypi=(0,0),ti=(1,0),κi=0,pf=(1,1),tf=(0,1),κf=0.Furthermore, the corner curve should exhibit monotone variation of itsx,ycoordinates between the end points, a unimodal curvature distribution, and be symmetric about the diagonal line from(0,1)to(1,0). If the curvature conditionsκi=κf=0are relaxed, we have a canonicalG1corner.The simplest non-trivial planar PH curves are cubics. PH cubics are capable of (uniquely) defining a canonicalG1corner, but not aG2corner. Any PH cubic is simply a translated, rotated, scaled and re-parameterized segment of a unique curve – the Tschirnhaus cubic (Farouki and Sakkalis, 1990). Instead of using the complex representation, the PH cubics may be characterized by simple geometrical constraints on their Bézier control polygons, namely(5)L2=L1L3andθ1=θ2,whereL1,L2,L3are the lengths of the control polygon legs, andθ1,θ2are the interior control polygon angles. Writingr(ξ)=p0(1−ξ)3+p13(1−ξ)2ξ+p23(1−ξ)ξ2+p3ξ3,one can easily verify that the unique PH cubic withr(0)=pi,r(1)=pfandr′(0)=|r′(0)|ti,r′(1)=|r′(1)|tfhas the control pointsp0=(0,0),p1=(2−2,0),p2=(1,2−1),p3=(1,1),and satisfies conditions (5) withL1=L2=L3=2−2andθ1=θ2=34π. The parametric speed of this curve is specified by the quadratic polynomialσ(ξ)=|r′(ξ)|=σ0(1−ξ)2+σ12(1−ξ)ξ+σ2ξ2with coefficientsσ0=σ2=3(2−2)andσ1=3(2−1). It has a rather mild variation between3(2−2)≈1.757359at the end-points and 1.5 at the mid-point,r(12)=18(10−32,32−2)≈(0.719670,0.280330).The total arc length of theG1PH cubic corner isS=13(σ0+σ1+σ2)=3−2≈1.585786(∼12.1%greater than the chord length). The curvature can be expressed asκ(ξ)=6(2−1)σ2(ξ),and it increases fromκ(0)=κ(1)=(1+2)/3≈0.804738at the end points toκ(12)=8(2−1)/3≈1.104570at the mid-point, an increase of∼37%(due entirely to the variation of the parametric speed).As may be seen in Fig. 1, the shape of theG1cubic corner curve is not aesthetically displeasing, and may be satisfactory for many design problems. In fact, as seen in Fig. 2, it closely approximates an arc of the unit circle. The greatest distanced=1459−302≈1.017767from the center of the circle occurs at the mid-pointr(12), amounting to a deviation of<2%. The main drawback of theG1PH cubic is the curvature discontinuity it incurs in rounding out a right-angle corner (see Fig. 1).Since the cubic PH curves can only defineG1corners (with no residual shape freedoms), we now consider the quintic PH curves. It is advantageous to use the complex representation defined by (2) and (3) withm=2. Consider the PH quinticr(ξ)defined by substituting a quadratic complex polynomial(6)w(ξ)=w0(1−ξ)2+w12(1−ξ)ξ+w2ξ2into (3) and integrating. The Bézier control points ofr(ξ)may be determined from the coefficientsw0,w1,w2as(7)p1=p0+15w02,p2=p1+15w0w1,p3=p2+152w12+w0w23,p4=p3+15w1w2,p5=p4+15w22,wherep0is a free integration constant. The end-derivatives ofr(ξ)are(8)r′(0)=w02andr′(1)=w22,and its end-point curvatures are specified by(9)κ(0)=4Im(w¯0w1)|w0|4andκ(1)=4Im(w¯1w2)|w2|4.Symmetric interpolation of the end tangents and curvatures thus implies thatw0,w1,w2must satisfyw02=λ2,w22=iλ2andIm(w¯0w1)=Im(w¯1w2)=0for a non-zero real value λ. Since the curve defined by substitutingw(ξ)into (3) and integrating is unchanged on replacingw0,w1,w2by−w0,−w1,−w2we may assume that(10)w0=λ>0from the first condition, while the second condition gives(11)w2=s1+i2λ,wheres=±1. Writingw1=u1+iv1and substitutingw0,w2into the last two conditions then givesv1=u1−v1=0, i.e.,w1=0. From (7) we then havep2=p1andp4=p3, so theG2corner is a special PH quintic, with just four distinct control points instead of six (Farouki, 1994). The fact that any PH quintic with zero end curvatures must havew1=0, and hencep2=p1andp4=p3, has been noted (in a more general context) in Theorem 5.1 of Walton and Meek (2009).Withp0=0andp5=1+i, interpolation of the corner end points yields the condition15[w02+w0w1+2w12+w0w23+w1w2+w22]=1+i,and on substituting forw0,w1,w2this becomes15[λ2+s1+i32λ2+iλ2]=1+i,which is equivalent to(32+s)λ2=152.Hence, sinceλ>0by assumption, we have(12)λ=[15232+s]1/2.Although the sign choicess=±1both define formally correct interpolants to the prescribed data, onlys=+1generates an acceptableG2corner curve (see Fig. 3). The curve defined by takings=−1exhibits negative curvature and a tight loop, so it must be discounted.Hence, there exists an essentially unique canonicalG2PH quintic corner, specified by the coefficients (10)–(12) withs=1. Settingc=3(6−2)/17, the control points of this curve can be expressed asp0=(0,0),p1=p2=(c,0),p3=p4=(1,1−c),p5=(1,1).The canonicalG2PH quintic corner may be regarded as a special case of the solution described in Section 5 of Walton and Meek (2009), corresponding to the choicesh=k=1andθ=12π. The curvature profile is shown in Fig. 3 – compared to theG1PH cubic corner in Fig. 1, it is evident that the imposition of zero end curvatures incurs a much stronger variation of curvature.The parametric speed is defined by the quadratic polynomialσ(ξ)=∑k=04σk(4k)(1−ξ)4−kξkwith coefficientsσ0=σ4=1517(6−2),σ1=σ3=0,σ2=517(32−1).It varies from15(6−2)/17≈4.046282at the end points to15(5+22)/136≈0.863429at the midpoint, namelyr(12)=(542−452,2+452)544≈(0.879339,0.120661).The arc length of theG2PH quintic corner isS=15(σ0+σ1+σ2+σ3+σ4)=(35−32)/17≈1.809256, or∼27.9%greater than the chord length. The curvature of this PH quintic can be expressed as(13)κ(ξ)=6017(32−1)(1−ξ)ξσ2(ξ).It increases from 0 at the end points toκ(12)=64(72−9)/15≈3.837845at the mid-point. From Fig. 3 one gains the impression that theG2PH quintic corner is almostG3, i.e., the arc-length derivative of curvaturedκ/dsvanishes at its end points. From (13) one can verify it is not exactlyG3sincedκds|ξ=0=−dκds|ξ=1=12+192225≈0.172756.Since theG2PH quintic corner curve offers no residual shape freedoms, we consider nowG2corners specified by degree 7 planar PH curves. Such curves are defined by substituting a cubic complex polynomialw(ξ)=w0(1−ξ)3+w13(1−ξ)2ξ+w23(1−ξ)ξ2+w3ξ3into the hodograph (3) and integrating. For symmetric interpolation of the end tangents we must haver′(0)=λ2andr′(1)=iλ2withλ≠0. Sincer′(0)=w02andr′(1)=w32, these conditions imply that(14)w0=λandw3=p1+i2λ,wherep=±1and we again takeλ>0without loss of generality. Also, sinceκ(0)=6Im(w¯0w1)|w0|4andκ(1)=6Im(w¯2w3)|w3|4,the conditionsκ(0)=0andκ(1)=0, together with the symmetry constraint|w1|=|w2|, imply that(15)w1=μandw2=q1+i2μwhereq=±1, for some real number μ. Finally, withp0=0andp3=1+i, the end-point displacement condition∫01r′(ξ)dξ=p3−p0=1+iyields the equation17[w02+w0w1+3w12+2w0w25+w0w3+9w1w210+3w22+2w1w35+w2w3+w32]=1+i.Substituting forw0,w1,w2,w3, the real and imaginary parts of the above condition yield the two equations(102+p)λ2+2(52+2p+2q)λμ+(62+9q)μ2=702,(102+p)λ2+2(52pq+2p+2q)λμ+(62+9q)μ2=702,forλ,μ. In order for these equations to be consistent, we must havepq=1, i.e.,p=q, and the two equations are then identical. Settinga=20+2s140,b=10+42s140,c=12+92s140,wheres=±1, they can be expressed in the form(16)[λμ][abbc][λμ]=1.The eigenvalues of the2×2matrix areζ1,ζ2=a+c±(a−c)2+4b22=16+52s±245+122s140,and the corresponding unit eigenvectors are1(ζ1−a)2+b2[bζ1−a]and1(ζ2−a)2+b2[bζ2−a].Assuming thatζ1<ζ2, both eigenvalues are positive whens=+1, butζ1is negative andζ2positive whens=−1.By diagonalizing the matrix on the left in Eq. (16) its solutions may be parameterized in terms of a free angular variable ϕ whens=+1as(17)λ(ϕ)=bcosϕζ1[(ζ1−a)2+b2]+bsinϕζ2[(ζ2−a)2+b2],(18)μ(ϕ)=(ζ1−a)cosϕζ1[(ζ1−a)2+b2]+(ζ2−a)sinϕζ2[(ζ2−a)2+b2],and whens=−1as(19)λ(ϕ)=btanϕ|ζ1|[(ζ1−a)2+b2]+bsecϕζ2[(ζ2−a)2+b2],(20)μ(ϕ)=(ζ1−a)tanϕ|ζ1|[(ζ1−a)2+b2]+(ζ2−a)secϕζ2[(ζ2−a)2+b2].As shown in Fig. 4, the above solutions describe an ellipse and a hyperbola, respectively, in the(λ,μ)plane. In practice, ϕ can be restricted to the interval[0,π]in the case of (17)–(18), since it is apparent that replacing ϕ withϕ+πsimply reverses the sign of λ and μ, and hence alsow0,w1,w2,w3from (14) and (15), and such a sign reversal leaves the curve unchanged.Once the complex valuesw0,w1,w2,w3are computed from (14)–(15) and (17)–(18) or (19)–(20), the Bézier control points of theG2degree 7 PH corner curve may be constructed from them through the expressionsp1=p0+17w02,p2=p1+17w0w1,p3=p2+173w12+2w0w25,p4=p3+17w0w3+9w1w210,p5=p4+173w22+2w1w35,p6=p5+17w2w3,p7=p6+17w32.It is found that the shape of the degree 7 PH corner defined by (14)–(15) and (17)–(18) is sensitive to the choice of the ϕ parameter, with acceptable shapes resulting from a relatively narrow range aboutϕ=12π. Fig. 5shows the corner shape and its curvature profile for the specific caseϕ=12π. The curve compares favorably with the uniqueG1PH cubic andG2PH quintic corners shown in Figs. 1 and 3. Unlike the former, it is curvature-continuous and does not closely resemble a circular arc. Also, the extremum curvature is only ∼1.4974, as compared to ∼3.8378 for the latter. The three corner shapes, and their curvatures versus fractional arc length (the total arc lengths are somewhat different), are compared in Fig. 6.As a further shape comparison of theG1PH cubic,G2PH quintic, andG2degree 7 PH corner withϕ=12π, Fig. 7shows each of these curve together with its evolute (locus of centers of curvature) and circle of curvature at the vertex (point of extremum curvature) of the corner curve. Note that the cusp of the evolute corresponds to the center of curvature at the vertex.Fig. 8illustrates the effect33Since the total arc length of the corner curves varies with ϕ, the curvature profiles are plotted as functions of the curve parameter t, rather than arc length, in Fig. 8.of varying ϕ away from12π. As ϕ is reduced below12π, one obtains a sharper corner, with a more pronounced mid-point curvature extremum, but for ϕ less than∼0.36πthe corner develops slight negative curvatures and a severe curvature extremum. As ϕ increases above12π, on the other hand, the corner becomes much shallower. Whenϕ≈0.53π, one obtains a quite remarkable curvature distribution – nearly constant over most of the curve, with a rapid rise and fall near the end points. As observed in Fig. 8, the curvature profile exhibits an increasingly pronounced bimodal distribution as ϕ increases above∼0.53π. Fig. 9illustrates the variation of the maximum (mid-point) curvature for0.36π⩽ϕ⩽0.53π.Experiments show that values of ϕ outside the interval[0.36π,0.53π]typically produce curves of poor shape, with tight loops, negative curvature, or a bimodal curvature profile, and should therefore be avoided. In practice, the range0.36π⩽ϕ⩽0.53πoffers considerable freedom in manipulating the corner shape, while ensuring (i) a unimodal curvature distribution; (ii) a reasonable curvature extremum; and (iii) absence of negative curvature and loops. As a default, the caseϕ=12πis an excellent choice (see Fig. 5).Fig. 10shows that the locus traced by the control pointp3, as ϕ varies, is an ellipse. It is observed thatp3lies above the x-axis – ensuring positive curvature – only for0.36π≲ϕ≲0.62π. The highest location ofp3above the x-axis occurs for ϕ slightly less than12π– namely,ϕ≈0.49π.Although they are formal solutions to the given boundary conditions, theG2interpolants to the corner data defined by (14)–(15) withp=q=−1, in conjunction with expressions (19)–(20), were found to be of unacceptable shape – with negative curvature and/or small or large loops – for all values of the parameter ϕ. These solutions should therefore be discounted.It has been seen that the PH cubics and PH quintics define uniqueG1andG2corners, respectively, while degree 7 PH curves admitG2corners embodying a single free parameter, that proves useful in tuning the curvature profile. As a final corner shape, incorporating two degrees of freedom, we consider here a solution based on splicing together two PH quintic segments.Consider two PH quintic segmentsr1(ξ)andr2(ξ), such thatr1(0)=(0,0),r1(1)=r2(0),r2(1)=(1,1). By symmetry, the juncture point must have coordinatesr1(1)=r2(0)=(α,1−α)with0<α<1. At that point, the two curves must also have a common tangent (inclined at angle14πwith the positive x-direction), and equal curvatures, to ensure aG2splice.In fact,r2(ξ)must be a reflection ofr1(ξ)in the diagonal line between(0,0)to(1,1), so we can focus on the construction ofr1(ξ). Specifyingr1(ξ)in the complex representation by substituting (6) into (3) and integrating, it must satisfy the interpolation constraintsr1(0)=0,r1′(0)=λ2,κ(0)=0,andr1(1)=α+i(1−α),r1′(1)=μ2exp(i14π)withλ≠0,μ≠0, and0<α<1. The conditionr1(0)=0is achieved by choice of the integration constant upon integrating (3), andr′(0)=λ2yieldsw0=λ, where we again assumeλ>0without loss of generality. Also, the conditionκ(0)=0becomesIm(λ(u1+iv1))=0, sov1=0sinceλ≠0, and hencew1=u1. Finally, fromr′(1)=μ2exp(i14π)we havew2=±μexp(i18π).These expressions forw0,w1,w2must satisfy the end-point conditionr(1)=α+(1−α)i, which may be expressed as15[w02+w0w1+2w12+w0w23+w1w2+w22]=α+(1−α)i.Substituting forw0,w1,w2and taking real and imaginary parts, this becomes(21)2u12+3(λ±μcos18π)u1+3λ2±λμcos18π+3μ2cos14π=15α,(22)±3μsin18πu1±λμsin18π+3μ2sin14π=15(1−α).Since these two real equations incorporate the four free parametersα,λ,μ,u1we may expect the solutions to exhibit two degrees of freedom. Eliminating α between (21) and (22) yields a quadratic equation(23)a2u12+a1u1+a0=0inu1with coefficients dependent on λ and μ, namelya2=2,a1=3(λ±μ(sin18π+cos18π)),a0=3λ2±λμ(sin18π+cos18π)+3μ2(sin14π+cos14π)−15.Note that the discriminantΔ=a12−4a0a2of (23) can be expressed asΔ=120−15λ2±10(sin18π+cos18π)λμ+(9−15sin14π−24cos14π)μ2,and we must haveΔ⩾0to obtain a realu1value. If the + sign is chosen, this condition identifies the set of feasible values as the interior of an ellipse centered on the origin in the(λ,μ)plane. Choosing feasible λ and μ values, one can solve (23) foru1and obtain α from (21) – the complex coefficientsw0,w1,w2in (6) are then completely determined.Once the control points for the first segment of the splicedG2PH quintic corner are computed from (7) usingp0=0and thesew0,w1,w2values, the control points for the second segment can be determined from (7) usingp0=α+(1−α)iandw0,w1,w2values obtained by applying the transformationwk→1+i2w¯k−2,k=0,1,2to the values for the first segment – this transformation allows for the factr2(ξ)is the mirror image ofr1(ξ)in the diagonal line from(0,1)to(1,0).The parameter values(λ,μ)=(0.99,0.91)were found empirically to yield an excellent splicedG2PH quintic corner shape when the + sign is used in (21)–(22). The curve, together with its control polygon and curvature profile, are illustrated in Fig. 11. The extremum curvature, at the juncture of the two segments, is ∼1.8013 – slightly higher than for the degree 7G2corner withϕ=12π, but much lower than for that defined by a single PH quintic.Fig. 12illustrates the influence of the λ and μ parameters on the corner curvature profile. If either parameter is reduced below the nominal value, the extremum curvature increases. If either is increased above the nominal value, the curvature profile assumes a bimodal configuration. These effects are more pronounced with variation of the μ parameter than with the λ parameter.44It is also possible to study the dependence of the location of control pointp3on the parametersλ,μ(as with the degree 7 case in Section 5), but the analysis is more involved because of the two degrees of freedom and the intermediate quadratic equation (23).A systematic shape optimization of the splicedG2PH quintic corner with respect to the(λ,μ)parameters is a non-trivial task, that we do not attempt here. It should be noted that these parameters can also be exploited in other ways – for example, aG3splice can be achieved by requiring thatκ′(1)=0. From (4) the derivative of the curvature can be expressed asκ′=2|w|2Im(w¯w″)−8Re(w¯w′)Im(w¯w′)|w|6,and substituting (6) with the above expressions forw0,w1,w2the conditionκ′(1)=0reduces to(24)8cos18πu12∓6μu1∓λμ=0.Eqs. (23) and (24) must have a common root, i.e., their resultant with respect tou1must vanish. This imposes a constraint between λ and μ, leaving just one freedom (there are insufficient freedoms to ensureG3continuity at the splice point and the connections with the linear segments).Several solutions to the problem of specifying rounded right-angle corners in terms ofG2planar Pythagorean-hodograph curves have been presented. The simplest consists of a (unique) single PH quintic segment – in this case, the extremum curvature is relatively large, but the corner shape is nevertheless aesthetically quite attractive. TheG2corners defined by a single PH curve of degree 7 comprise a one-parameter family, offering scope for adjustment of the curvature distribution. A nominal value for this parameter was identified, that generates an appealing corner shape with a smooth unimodal curvature distribution, and a modest extremum curvature. Finally, aG2corner based on splicing together two PH quintics was proposed, with two free parameters for shape adjustment. Nominal values for the parameters were identified, and their influence on the curvature profile was studied.TheG2corner constructions can be easily implemented using the complex representation of planar PH curve, and incur little more than the solutions of quadratic equations. It should be noted that sign ambiguities arise at various points in the solution procedure, and inappropriate choices can yield curves with unacceptable shape properties (negative curvature or tight loops) that nevertheless satisfy the specified boundary conditions. The appropriate signs, and ranges for the free parameters, are indicated throughout the presentation to ensure that such undesired extraneous solutions are circumvented.The design ofG2corners in terms of PH curves offers several important advantages over “ordinary” polynomial or spline curves, including exact arc length measurement, rational offset curves, and the availability of real-time interpolator algorithms to drive CNC machines directly from the analytic curve description for manufacturing or inspection applications.
