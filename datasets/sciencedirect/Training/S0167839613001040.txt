@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A new binary four-point subdivision scheme is presented, which keeps the second-order divided difference at the old vertices unchanged when the new vertices are inserted. Using the symbol of the subdivision scheme, we show that the limit curve is at leastC3continuous. Furthermore, the conditions imposed on the initial points are also discussed, thus the given limit functions are both monotonicity preserving and convexity preserving

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Subdivision methods are widely used in many areas including CAGD, CG and related areas. Most of the existing univariate subdivision schemes are binary, stationary and linear. The classical binary four-point scheme (Dubuc, 1986; Dyn et al., 1987) is one of the earliest and most popular interpolatory curve subdivision schemes, which can only achieveC1continuous curves. In Dyn et al. (1999) the convexity is in the functional sense and is achieved for data satisfying certain conditions in addition to the convexity conditions. Many subdivision schemes cannot preserve monotonicity in the current literature. Cai (1995) presented a four-point interpolatory subdivision scheme which isC1continuous in nonuniform control points and discussed the monotonicity preservation of the limit curve. A family of local nonlinear stationary interpolatory subdivision schemes which preserve monotonicity were constructed in Kuijt and van Damme (1999). In order to improve the smoothness of subdivision curves, Hassan et al. (2002) introduced an interpolating four-point ternary subdivision scheme, which generatedC2continuous curves. Cai (2009) discussed the convexity preserving properties of the subdivision scheme (Hassan et al., 2002). Kuijt and van Damme (2002) were concerned with a class of shape preserving four-point subdivision scheme which is stationary and interpolated nonuniform data. However, the curves generated by the above methods are at mostC2continuous. Hao et al. (2011) described a linear six-point binary approximating subdivision scheme which preserves convexity while its support is large. Hormann and Sabin (2008) constructed the subdivision schemes according to the properties, such as the support, the Hölder regularity, the precision set and so on. Different subdivision schemes were designed for meeting different requirements in Sabin and Dodgson (2005), Hernández-Mederos et al. (2009), Augsdörfer et al. (2010), Floater (2011). Deng and Wang (2010) took a geometric approach to generate subdivision curve, and the resulting curve isG1continuous and the shape is determined by the initial points and their tangent vectors. The circular arc segment was reproduced when the initial points and their initial tangent vectors were sampled from a circular arc segment.The important issues in the implementation of the subdivision scheme are smoothness, size of support and shape preserving properties. The goal of this paper is to construct aC3continuous subdivision scheme which preserves shape. Inspired by Hormann and Sabin (2008), Sabin and Dodgson (2005), Augsdörfer et al. (2010), we introduce a binary four-pointC3continuous subdivision scheme in Section 3. In Section 4 we discuss the conditions of the initial points guaranteeing monotonicity preservation. The conditions of preserving convexity are given in Section 5. We conclude our work with a short summary in Section 6.Given a set of initial control pointsP0={pi0}i∈Z, letPk={pik}i∈Zbe the set of control points at order k (k⩾0,k∈Z) subdivision. Define{pik+1}i∈Zrecursively by the following binary subdivision rules:(1)pik+1=∑j∈Zai−2jpjk,i∈Z,where the finite seta={ai}i∈Zis called a mask. The symbol of the scheme is defined asa(z)=∑i∈Zaizi.Theorem 1(SeeDyn and Levin, 2002.) Let a binary subdivision scheme S be convergent. Then the maska={ai}i∈Zsatisfies(2)∑i∈Za2i=∑i∈Za2i+1=1.Theorem 2(SeeDyn and Levin, 2002.) Let a subdivision scheme S with a maska={ai}i∈Zsatisfy(2). Then there exists a subdivision schemeS1(first order difference scheme of S) which satisfies the propertydPk=S1dPk−1,wherePk=SkP0,dPk={(dpk)i=2k(pi+1k−pik)|i∈Z}. The symbol ofS1isa(1)(z)=2z1+za(z). Generally, ifSnexists andSnis the nth order difference scheme of S with a maska(n)={ai(n)}i∈Z, then the symbol ofSnisa(n)(z)=∑i∈Zai(n)zi=(2z1+z)na(z).Theorem 3(SeeZheng et al., 2004.) Let a subdivision scheme S have a maska(0)={ai(0)}i∈Z, and its jth order difference schemeSj(j=1,2,…,n+1)exist and have the maska(j)={ai(j)}i∈Zsatisfying(3)∑i∈Za2i(j)=∑i∈Za2i+1(j)=1,j=0,1,2,…,n.If there exists an integerL⩾1, such that‖(12Sn+1)L‖∞<1, then the subdivision scheme S isCncontinuous, where‖(12Sn+1)L‖∞={max∑i∈Z|bi−2L(n+1)[L]|:0⩽i<2L},b[L](z)=b(z)b(z2)⋯b(z2L−1),b(z)=12a(n+1)(z).Especially, whenL=1,‖12Sn+1‖∞=12max{∑i∈Z|a2i(n+1)|,∑i∈Z|a2i+1(n+1)|}.Sabin and Dodgson (2005) observed that the second-order divided difference at each new inserted point of the four-point scheme (Dubuc, 1986) was the mean of the second-order divided differences of the adjacent old points. The limit curve generated by the subdivision scheme (Dubuc, 1986) is onlyC1continuous. A relaxation of the four-point scheme was constructed in order to make the new second-order divided difference closer to that of the old points in Hormann and Sabin (2008). The subdivision scheme (Hormann and Sabin, 2008) isC3continuous, while the second-order divided difference at the old points changes at different subdivision levels. Augsdörfer et al. (2010) moved the old point C such that the second-order divided difference of the modified pointdCˆis equal to a weighted mean of the old second-order divided differencedCkand the new second-order divided differencedCk+1, i.e.dCˆ=αdCk+(1−α)dCk+1, where k denotes the subdivision level,α∈[0,1]. The second-order divided difference at the old vertices does not change in Augsdörfer et al. (2010), but the limit curve is onlyC2continuous. In order to construct a subdivision scheme in which the second-order divided difference at the old vertices does not change and the limit curve isC3continuous, we use the stencil[−β,12+β,12+β,−β]instead of[−1,9,9,−1]/16to compute the new inserted vertices in Dubuc (1986), Hormann and Sabin (2008), Augsdörfer et al. (2010). Then we get a new binary four-point subdivision scheme as follows:(4){p2ik+1=−αβ2pi−2k+18αpi−1k+(1+αβ−α4)pik+18αpi+1k−αβ2pi+2k,p2i+1k+1=−βpi−1k+(12+β)pik+(12+β)pi+1k−βpi+2k.Remark 4Forα=0the scheme (4) is the four-point scheme with the tension parameter of Dyn et al. (1987). Letα=0,β=116. Then the scheme (4) rebuilds the scheme in Dubuc (1986). Letα=34,β=116. Then we can get the subdivision scheme in Hormann and Sabin (2008). Letβ=116. Then the scheme (4) coincides with the one in Augsdörfer et al. (2010).The mask of the scheme (4) isa={−αβ2,−β,18α,12+β,1+αβ−α4,12+β,18α,−β,−αβ2}.In order to make the scheme (4) beC3continuous, the following equations(5)∑i∈Za2i(j)=∑i∈Za2i+1(j)=1,j=0,1,2,…,3must be tenable. Solving Eqs. (5), we can getα=1,β=132orα=34,β=116. In order to make the second-order divided difference at the old vertices not change when the new vertices are inserted, we chooseα=1,β=132. Then the subdivision scheme (4) can be rewritten as follows:(6){p2ik+1=−164pi−2k+18pi−1k+2532pik+18pi+1k−164pi+2k,p2i+1k+1=−132pi−1k+1732pik+1732pi+1k−132pi+2k.In this subsection, we use Theorem 3 to analyze the convergence andCkcontinuity of the subdivision scheme (6).Theorem 5The limit curve generated by the subdivision scheme(6)isC3continuous.ProofThe symbol of the scheme (6) isa(z)=−164z−4−132z−3+18z−2+1732z−1+2532+1732z+18z2−132z3−164z4.By construction, we have∑i∈Za2i(j)=∑i∈Za2i+1(j)=1,j=0,1,2,…,3and‖(12S4)2‖∞=34<1.Consequently, it follows from Theorem 3 that the subdivision scheme (6) isC3continuous.  □In geometric shape design, shape preserving of subdivision curve is an important and difficult research topic. In Sections 4 and 5, we will discuss what conditions should be imposed on the initial points so that the limit curve generated by the subdivision scheme (6) is both monotonicity preserving and convexity preserving.Lemma 6Let{fi0}i∈Zsatisfy⋯f−10<f00<f10<⋯<fn−10<fn0<fn+10⋯.DenoteDik=fi+1k−fik,qik=Di+1kDik,Qk=maxi{qik,1qik},∀k⩾0,k∈Z,i∈Z.Furthermore, let1⩽μ⩽9,μ∈R. If1μ⩽Q0⩽μ,{fik}is defined by the subdivision scheme(6), then(7)Dik>0,1μ⩽Qk⩽μ,∀k⩾0,k∈Z,i∈Z.ProofWe use mathematical induction to verify the lemma.Whenk=0,Di0=fi+10−fi0>0,1μ⩽Q0⩽μ, then (7) is true.Suppose that (7) holds for k, next we will verify it also holds fork+1.(8)D2ik+1=f2i+1k+1−f2ik+1=−164(fi−1k−fi−2k)+964(fik−fi−1k)+2564(fi+1k−fik)−164(fi+2k−fi+1k)⩾Di−1k(964−164⋅μ+2564⋅1μ−164)>0,(9)D2i+1k+1=f2i+2k+1−f2i+1k+1=−164(fik−fi−1k)+2564(fi+1k−fik)+964(fi+2k−fi+1k)−164(fi+3k−fi+2k)⩾Di+1k(964−164⋅μ+2564⋅1μ−164)>0.Now we prove1μ⩽Qk+1⩽μ.Sinceq2ik+1=D2i+1k+1D2ik+1=9qi−1kqik−qi−1kqikqi+1k+25qi−1k−19−1qi−2k+25qi−1k−qi−1kqik,thenq2ik+1−μ=9qi−1kqik−qi−1kqikqi+1k+25qi−1k−1−9μ+1qi−2kμ−25qi−1kμ+qi−1kqikμ9−1qi−2k+25qi−1k−qi−1kqik.By (8), the denominator of the above expression64⋅D2ik+1Di−1k>0, and the numerator satisfies:when1⩽μ⩽8−40,numerator⩽μ(9−1μ+μ)⋅qi−1k+25(1−μ)⋅qi−1k+μ2−9μ−1⩽0;when8−40<μ⩽9,numerator⩽μ(9−1μ+μ)⋅qi−1k+25(1−μ)⋅qi−1k+μ2−9μ−1<0.Thereforeq2ik+1⩽μ.In the same way, we can getq2i+1k+1⩽μ,1q2ik+1⩽μ, and1q2i+1k+1⩽μ.SoQk+1⩽μ.SinceQk+1=maxi{qik+1,1qik+1}, it is obvious thatQk+1⩾1μ.  □A direct consequence of Lemma 6 is Theorem 7.Theorem 7Assume that the initial control points{pi0}i∈Z,pi0=(xi0,fi0)are strictly monotone increasing (strictly monotone decreasing). DenoteX0=maxi{xi+20−xi+10xi+10−xi0,xi+10−xi0xi+20−xi+10},Q0=maxi{qi0,1qi0}.Then for1μ⩽X0⩽μ, and1μ⩽Q0⩽μ,1⩽μ⩽9, the limit functions generated by the subdivision scheme(6)are strictly monotone increasing (strictly monotone decreasing).Definition 8(See Le Méhauté and Utreras, 1994.) Given a set of control points{pik}i∈Z,pik=(xik,fik),fikis strictly convex at a pointxik, iff[xi−1k,xik,xi+1k]>0.In this section, we check the convexity preservation of the subdivision scheme (6) with uniform initial control points.Given a set of initial control points{pi0}i∈Z,pi0=(xi0,fi0)which are strictly convex, where{xi0}i∈Zare equidistant points. For convenience, we makeΔxi0=xi+10−xi0=1. By the subdivision scheme (6), we haveΔxik+1=xi+1k+1−xik+1=12Δxik=12k+1. Denotedik=f[xi−1k,xik,xi+1k]=22k−1(fi−1k−2fik+fi+1k)as the second-order divided differences. In the following, we will provedik>0,∀k⩾0,k∈Z,i∈Z.Theorem 9Suppose that the initial control points{pi0}i∈Z,pi0=(xi0,fi0)are strictly convex, i.e.di0>0,∀i∈Z. Denoterik=di+1kdik,Rk=maxi{rik,1rik},∀k⩾0,k∈Z. Furthermore, let1⩽λ⩽7,λ∈R. Then for1λ⩽R0⩽λ,(10)dik>0,1λ⩽Rk⩽λ,∀k⩾0,k∈Z,i∈Z.Namely, the limit functions generated by the subdivision scheme(6)are strictly convex.ProofWhenk=0,di0>0,1λ⩽R0⩽λ, is clearly true.Assume that (10) holds for k, now we prove it also holds fork+1.(11)d2ik+1=22k+1(f2i−1k+1−2f2ik+1+f2i+1k+1)=22k+1(14fi−1k−12fik+14fi+1k)>0,(12)d2i+1k+1=22k+1(f2ik+1−2f2i+1k+1+f2i+2k+1)⩾−116⋅dikλ(λ2−8λ−9)=−116⋅dikλ⋅(λ+1)(λ−9)>0.Next we will prove1λ⩽Rk+1⩽λ.Sincer2ik+1=d2i+1k+1d2ik+1=116dik(−1ri−1k+9+9rik−rikri+1k)dik=116(−1ri−1k+9+9rik−rikri+1k),thenr2ik+1−λ⩽−7λ2+8λ−116λ=−(λ−1)(7λ−1)16λ⩽0.Thereforer2ik+1⩽λ.By the same token, we getr2i+1k+1⩽λ,1r2ik+1⩽λand1r2i+1k+1⩽λ.SoRk+1⩽λ.SinceRk+1=maxi{rik+1,1rik+1}, it is obvious thatRk+1⩾1λ.  □From Theorem 7 and Theorem 9, we obtain that the shape preservation is for a subclass of data, satisfying additional conditions to the shape conditions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In geometric shape design, shape preserving of curve/surface is essential. Monotonicity preserving and convexity preserving are two major elements in shape preserving. In this paper, a family of binary subdivision scheme is constructed. The smoothness analysis is discussed by the symbol of the subdivision scheme, which indicates that the limit curve generated by our subdivision scheme isC3continuous. Successively, the conditions of the initial data guaranteeing monotonicity preservation and convexity preservation are derived.Our further work will be aimed at the study of the curve convexity from geometric notion. Extending the curves subdivision scheme to surfaces for control meshes of arbitrary topology is also our interested topic.
