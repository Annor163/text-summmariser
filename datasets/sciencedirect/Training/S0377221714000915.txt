@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Inventory record inaccuracy leads to ineffective replenishment decisions and deteriorates supply chain performance. Conducting cycle counts (i.e., periodic inventory auditing) is a common approach to correcting inventory records. It is not clear, however, how inaccuracy at different locations affects supply chain performance and how an effective cycle-count program for a multi-stage supply chain should be designed. This paper aims to answer these questions by considering a serial supply chain that has inventory record inaccuracy and operates under local base-stock policies. A random error, representing a stock loss, such as shrinkage or spoilage, reduces the physical inventory at each location in each period. The errors are cumulative and are not observed until a location performs a cycle count. We provide a simple recursion to evaluate the system cost and propose a heuristic to obtain effective base-stock levels. For a two-stage system with identical error distributions and counting costs, we prove that it is more effective to conduct more frequent cycle counts at the downstream stage. In a numerical study for more general systems, we find that location (proximity to the customer), error rates, and counting costs are primary factors that determine which stages should get a higher priority when allocating cycle counts. However, it is in general not effective to allocate all cycle counts to the priority stages only. One should balance cycle counts between priority stages and non-priority stages by considering secondary factors such as lead times, holding costs, and the supply chain length. In particular, more cycle counts should be allocated to a stage when the ratio of its lead time to the total system lead time is small and the ratio of its holding cost to the total system holding cost is large. In addition, more cycle counts should be allocated to downstream stages when the number of stages in the supply chain is large. The analysis and insights generated from our study can be used to design guidelines or scorecard systems that help managers design better cycle-count policies. Finally, we discuss implications of our study on RFID investments in a supply chain.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Inventory record inaccuracy refers to the discrepancy between physical inventory held in stock and the record of inventory stored in the information system of a firm. Shrinkage, spoilage, misplaced inventories, and transaction errors (e.g., scanning errors and incorrectly counting products) contribute to inaccurate inventory information. Inaccurate inventory information leads to ineffective replenishment decisions, which, in turn, result in poor service levels and higher inventory costs. This is a major issue affecting supply chain performance in manufacturing, distribution and retail settings. For example, DeHoratius and Raman (2008) found records to be inaccurate 65% of the items stored at a publicly traded retailer. According to ECR ECR Europe (2003), the value of lost inventory due to shrinkage in 2000 was €13.4billion for retailers and €4.6billion for manufacturers in Europe.A common method to mitigate the impact of inventory inaccuracy is to conduct cycle counts. Companies usually implement cycle-count policies according to an ABC classification scheme, i.e., classifying products into A, B, C classes based on product attributes, such as volume, error rate and value, and assigning a count cycle to each class (Jordan, 1994). Motivated by empirical studies and business practice, researchers recently have developed various analytical models, aiming to study this problem more rigorously (see Section 2 below). To our knowledge, all of the existing analytical results are on single-location models. Nevertheless, major apparel retailers and consumer-packaged goods companies have significant inaccuracy problems across their supply chains. Managers have limited knowledge of the extent of inaccuracy at different locations and their impact on overall supply chain performance (Delen, Hardgrave, & Sharda, 2009; Hardgrave, Aloysius, & Goyal, 2009, 2013). In this study, we investigate the impact of inventory inaccuracy on the supply chain performance. In particular, we aim to answer the following questions: (1) What is the impact of inventory inaccuracy at a location on the entire supply chain performance? (2) Given the fact that cycle counts are costly, which locations should have more frequent counts? (3) How should different product attributes and system characteristics be taken into account when designing cycle-count policies in a supply chain? The answers to these questions are not readily available in the academic and business literatures. While one may argue that record inaccuracy at downstream locations has a greater impact because of proximity to customers, inaccuracy at an upstream location affects the supply for all downstream locations. Similarly, one may argue that maintaining accurate records at a location with a longer lead time is more important because such locations are slower to respond to demand changes. On the other hand, such locations generally have more pipeline and safety stock, which implies that they would be affected less by record inaccuracy.In this paper, we consider a periodic-review, N-stage serial supply chain with inventory record inaccuracy. Random customer demand arrives at stage 1. Stage 1 replenishes from stage 2, stage 2 from stage 3, and so on, and stage N from an outside supplier with ample supply. There are constant transportation lead times between stages. Record inaccuracy is caused by a random inventory loss that reduces physical inventory. (See Section 2 for a discussion on the other causes of inventory inaccuracy.) To describe inventory inaccuracy, we use the term “nominal” to signify inventory records stored in the computer system, and “actual” to signify the physical inventory levels. Each stage implements a cycle-count policy to correct the inventory records. A fixed stage-specific inspection cost is incurred for each cycle count. Errors at each stage are cumulative and they are not observed by the information system unless the stage conducts a cycle count. Thus, the discrepancy between the nominal inventory and the actual inventory equals the accumulated error since the last cycle count. The material flow is controlled by local base-stock policies. That is, if the local nominal inventory order position at a stage is less than a target base-stock level, the stage places an order to raise the nominal inventory position to the target level. Such a replenishment scheme is commonly seen in practice and most firms have computer systems automate this process. The objective is to minimize the actual average total supply-chain cost per period.To evaluate the system cost, we derive the actual local inventory variables for any given cycle-count policy. However, obtaining these local inventory variables requires characterizing the local demand for each stage. One key contribution of this paper is that we provide a simple procedure to evaluate the system cost. This procedure recursively evaluates the cost for each echelon (a stage and all of its downstream stages) starting from echelon 1 to echelon N. Moreover, this recursion leads to a heuristic to find local base-stock levels. A numerical study suggests that the heuristic is effective. We then use these results to answer the research questions.For two-stage systems, regarding the impact of errors, we show that it is more costly to have the same error occur at the downstream stage than at the upstream stage. Furthermore, regarding the cycle-count policies, we show that it is always a better strategy to assign more cycle counts to the downstream stage than to the upstream stage when both stages have identical errors and counting costs. For more general systems, we categorize system parameters into two groups in terms of their effect on cycle-count policy decisions. Primary factors determine which stages should get a higher priority when allocating cycle counts. They include location (position in the supply chain), error rate, and counting cost. All else being equal, downstream locations should be assigned more frequent counts. However, a significantly higher error rate or lower counting cost at an upstream stage may reverse the result. We observe that the marginal benefit of cycle counts is decreasing in its frequency. Thus, one should not allocate all cycle counts to a single location. We therefore suggest using secondary factors to determine whether the policy should strongly favor the high-priority stages or allocate counts in a more balanced way. The secondary factors include lead time and holding cost structure and the supply chain length. We find that more cycle counts should be allocated to a stage if the ratio of the stage’s lead time to the total system lead time is small and the ratio of the stage’s holding cost to the total holding cost is large. Furthermore, more cycle counts should be allocated to downstream stages if the supply chain is long (i.e., the number of stages in the supply chain is large).Our research questions have implications for investment decisions on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems. Specifically, if a location installs RFID readers, this will, in principle, eliminate inventory inaccuracy by continuously monitoring the inventory. This has the same effect as conducting a cycle count in each period in our model. In fact, many RFID applications in retail supply chains involve hand-held RFID readers, whose role is to facilitate cycle counting. Because RFID implementation can be very costly (Kearney, 2004), many industry practitioners are concerned about where RFID readers should be installed in a supply chain (Chappell et al., 2002). Labor savings and investment costs of RFID systems can be quantified in each stage in isolation from others (Chopra & Sodhi, 2007), but it is not clear how one can quantify the impact of reducing inaccuracy at a particular stage on supply chain performance. The guidelines developed in this paper have implications on how to prioritize RFID investments in a supply chain.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses major causes of inventory inaccuracy in supply chains and reviews the literature related to each of the causes. Section 3 presents a single-stage model and discusses the model set-up. Section 4 introduces the serial system and provides a scheme to evaluate the average total cost per period. Section 5 presents the lower bound and the heuristic algorithm. Section 6 presents our analytical and numerical results and provide answers to the research questions. Section 7 concludes. All proofs are provided in Appendix A.Empirical research and industry reports indicate that shrinkage, transaction errors, and misplaced items are the main reasons that cause inventory inaccuracy (ECR Europe, 2003; Raman & Ton, 2003; Sheppard & Brown, 1993). In the following, we describe each type of inaccuracy and its impact on the supply chain.Shrinkage, also known as stock loss, may be due to theft by shoppers or employees, and spoiled and damaged inventory. The impact of shrinkage on the actual inventory is one-sided: it always reduces the actual inventory. Thus, the inventory record is always greater than or equal to the actual inventory when shrinkage is the only reason that causes inventory inaccuracy. Our model considers this type of inaccuracy. In a supply chain, inventory shrinkages between locations are often independent because losing a unit of inventory at one location is not related to that at another location.Shrinkage is found to be the dominant cause of inventory inaccuracy in many empirical studies. Kang and Gershwin (2005) report two firms for which the majority of the inventory inaccuracy is due to stock loss. Similarly, ECR Europe (2001, 2003) conduct a comprehensive study over more than 200 companies and suggest that stock loss errors may be more prominent than others. In these studies, shrinkage is estimated to be about 1.7% of the sales for retailers and 0.56% for manufacturers. The National Retail Security Survey of 118 retailers (Hollinger, 2003) reports similar results. These studies emphasize the stockout effects of shrinkage. Chen (2013) proposes a data-driven optimal inspection policy for a single-item model. Fleisch and Tellkamp (2005) conduct a simulation study on the impact of inventory shrinkage for a three-echelon supply chain. Arguably, shrinkage has the most direct impact on supply chain performance because shrinkage at an upstream location will directly affect the stock availability of its downstream location, which may, in turn, lead to significant stockouts or backlogs for the system. In order to directly address this issue affecting many supply chains, we consider only shrinkage-type inaccuracy in the present paper.Transaction errors refer to errors caused by misidentification of the items or miscounting of the items in inbound and outbound processes. This transaction will make the actual inventory larger (smaller) than the nominal inventory. Thus, the impact of transaction error on the actual inventory is two-sided: it may increase or decrease the actual inventory. Iglehart and Morey (1972) is the first paper to consider transaction errors in a single-stage model. The inventory system implements a base-stock policy and the objective is to find the cycle-count frequency that minimizes inspection and inventory holding costs subject to a pre-specified inaccuracy probability. In an empirical study of one retailer’s records, DeHoratius and Raman (2008) report that the difference between physical inventory and inventory record can be positive or negative. They also find that the extent of errors increases with sales volume, the number of stages in the supply chain, and product variety. There are recent papers that investigate optimal and effective inventory and inspection policies for single-stage model, e.g., Kök and Shang (2007), DeHoratius, Mersereau, and Schrage (2008), Sahin, Buzacott, and Dallery (2008), Deshpande, Schwarz, and Raju (2009), Sahin and Dallery (2009), and Mersereau (2012). To our knowledge, there has been no work on investigating the impact of transaction errors on a multi-stage supply chain.Misplaced or inaccessible inventory refers to inventory that is physically at the facility, but its exact location is unknown. The impact of misplaced inventory is also one-sided: it reduces actual inventory levels. However, unlike shrinkage, misplaced inventory is not permanently lost; it may be recovered and added to the actual inventory after a cycle count. Rekik, Sahin, Jemai, and Dallery (2008) investigate the impact of different types of misplacement errors for a retailer–supplier system under a newsvednor framework. Çamdereli and Swaminathan (2009) study inventory decisions and coordination contracts for a system similar to Rekik et al.Incorporating all error types in a model without any simplifying assumptions is a difficult task even for single-stage systems. Atali, Lee, and Özer (2005) and Bensoussan, Çakanyıldırım, and Sethi (2007) consider multiple types of errors in a single-stage model. The former assumes that errors occur independently from the current inventory levels in order to derive inventory policies. The latter develops a heuristic feedback policy due to the dimensionality of the problem. We refer the reader to Chen and Mersereau (2013) for a review on inventory inaccuracy issues and models.Our research also pertains to the literature with RFID. One of the benefits of RFID systems is greater visibility of material flow and order progress. Gaukler, Özer, and Hausman (2008) and Kim, Klabjan, and Simchi-Levi (2007) study expediting strategies given the accurate order progress information from upstream stages. Bottani, Montanari, and Volpi (2010) investigates the impact of RFID on mitigating the bullwhip effect in the Italian FMCG supply chain. Pei and Klabjan (2010) study the optimal inventory policy for a serial system in which RFID systems provide order progress information for replenishments and shipments. They compare the expected costs of the model with different levels of RFID deployment and find that broader deployment reduces costs. This group of papers focuses on gaining visibility into order movements that are usually modeled with a stochastic lead time. Our focus is different in that we compare the benefit of reducing inaccuracy at different stages in a supply chain. For a review of the literature on RFID-related models and future applications, see Zipkin (2006) and Lee and Özer (2007).The present paper builds on the literature on multi-echelon inventory systems, particularly the classical serial supply chain model studied by Clark and Scarf (1960), Chen and Zheng (1994), and many others. We incorporate inventory record inaccuracy and cycle-count policies in the serial system by introducing unobserved inventory errors at each stage. This leads to an additional dimension in the inventory dynamics and expands the set of decision variables.Finally, this paper is related to inventory/production systems with random yields. For single-stage yield models under periodic review, Henig and Gerchak (1990) show that base-stock type policies are optimal. Lee and Yano (1988) study a multi-stage model for a single production run to meet a single-period demand. Liu, So, and Zhang (2010) consider the impact of supply reliability on inventory and pricing decisions. On a related topic, Bollapragada, Rao, and Zhang (2004) consider assembly systems with random capacity at each location that are controlled with base-stock policies. In random yield and random capacity models, the uncertainty at every stage is observable in each period after it is realized, which removes any uncertainty about inventory levels in the supply chain. In our model, however, the errors at a stage are not observed and accumulate until a cycle count is performed.In this section we consider a single-stage system. We use this model to illustrate the assumptions and the concept of nominal and actual inventory variables. This discussion sets the stage for the serial system.Consider a periodic-review inventory system that orders according to a base-stock policy. Time is divided into periods of length one and the periods are numbered0,1,2,…. There is a constant lead time of L periods. Customer demand follows a Poisson process with rateλ. Let[t,t+r)and[t,t+r]denote the time interval over periodst,t+1,…,t+r-1and periodst,t+1,…,t+r, respectively. LetD[intt,t+r)andD[t,t+r]denote the total demand that occurs in[t,t+r)and[t,t+r], respectively. We denoteD[r)andD[r]the total demand in r andr+1periods for the long-run average cost calculations. We assume that a random loss of inventory occurs in each period that reduces the level of actual inventory. We call the random inventory loss an error and we assume that the errors follow a Poisson process with rateμ. Letξ[t,t+r)andξ[t,t+r]denote the accumulated error in[t,t+r)and[t,t+r], respectively, andξ[r)andξrdenote total error accumulated in r andr+1periods for the long-run average cost calculations. The system implements a cycle-count policy to correct the inventory record. That is, the stage conducts a cycle count every T periods, where T represents the cycle-count interval. The system incurs a fixed cost of K every time a cycle count is conducted. Errors in the system accumulate and are not observed until a cycle count is conducted. As a result, the discrepancy between actual and nominal inventory positions is nondecreasing between two cycle counts. One may view this system as consisting of two processes: (1) The actual inventory dynamics and the cost evaluation process based on the actual inventory and (2) the ordering process in which orders are placed based on the nominal inventory order position (or inventory record). Below is the sequence of events in each period.(1)The stage receives a shipment at the beginning of a period,random error and random customer demand occurs during the period,if the current period is a cycle-count period, then the stage conducts a cycle count,the stage places an order according to the nominal inventory order position,costs are evaluated at the end of the period.We assume that the random demand and error processes during the period are interleaving Poisson processes.1The model can be generalized to allow for general demand and error distributions if periodic demand were realized first, depleted the inventory and then the error occurred.1The actual inventory level at the end of a period is the beginning actual inventory level minus the sum of the two Poisson random variables, i.e., one period of demand and one period of error, regardless of our assumptions about the order of the two processes.We now describe how these events affect the nominal and actual inventory variables. We define the following inventory variables to facilitate the subsequent discussion.AIOP-(t)=Actual inventory order position at the beginning of periodt,AIOP(t)=Actual inventory order position after placing an order at the end of periodt,AIL-(t)=Actual inventory level at the beginning of periodtafter receiving a shipment,AIL(t)=Actual inventory level after error and demand occur,B(t)=Actual backlogged consumer demand after error and demand occur.LetNIOP-(t),NIOP(t),NIL-(t), andNIL(t)denote the corresponding nominal inventory variables. In event (1), bothAIL-(t)andNIL-(t)increase because of the arriving shipment. In event (2), random error reduces the actual inventory variables and random demand reduces the nominal and actual inventory variables.AIL(t)andAIOP(t)are determined by the total demand from the two random processes. In event (3), the nominal inventory variables are aligned with the actual ones if the stage conducts a cycle count. In event (4), the stage places an order according to the nominal inventory order position. That is, at the end of a period, if the nominal inventory order position is less than the local base-stock level s, the stage places an order that raises the nominal inventory order position to s; otherwise, the stage does not order. Thus, event (4) determines bothNIOP(t)andAIOP(t)(or equivalently,NIOP-(t+1)andAIOP-(t+1)). In event (5), costs are evaluated based onAIL(t). For this purpose, define[x]+=max{x,0}and[x]-=max{0,-x}. A linear holding cost h is incurred for each unit of actual on-hand inventory[AIL(t)]+per period and a backorder cost b for each unit of actual backlogged consumer demandB(t)per period. The system is backlogged ifAIL(t)is negative. However, only a portion of that backlog is caused by the customer demand process, while the rest is due to the error process. The distribution of the actual backlogged demandB(t)depends on the total backlog level[AIL(t)]-as described later in this section. The objective is to minimize the average total cost per period.We make the following remarks about the model assumptions. First, the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors implies that the error distribution is independent of the inventory level. While certain types of inventory losses, such as invisible demand may satisfy this assumption, other error types such as shrinkage or spoilage can occur only when inventory level is positive. We make this assumption for tractability of the model. Modeling the dependence on inventory level would require keeping track of periodic demand and error during lead time as a vector. This would cause the size of the state space to grow intractably large, which is similar to the difficulty in the lost-sales system. Second, for tractability, we assume that the discrepancy between the actual inventory and nominal inventory is reconciled only when a cycle count is performed. There is no correction of the records due to the occurrence of a backorder. That is, if the computer shows the item in stock but it is actually not available, the demand is backlogged and the backorder information is not used to correct the records. Because we ignore the occurrence of such corrections in our characterization of the system state, the present model can be seen as an approximation to the systems that utilize the backlog information to correct records when the backlog probability is small. Many companies either do not have proper systems in place to update their computer records or do not allow line workers to change system records to ensure data integrity. Third, demand fulfillment and cost calculation are based only on actual on-hand inventory(AIL)+and actual backlogged demand B. In daily operations, a company may do its accounting based on the inventory records. However, at the end of a year, the annual cost according to the information system may be different from the actual annual cost, which is realized based on the actual inventory dynamics. This difference is due to the inaccuracy of the records. Therefore, a reconciliation by the accounting department is always necessary.We use an example to illustrate the inventory dynamics under the nominal and actual inventory schemes. Consider a single-stage system withT=2,L=2, ands=10. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the dynamics of the nominal inventory order position and inventory level. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the corresponding actual inventory variables. The demand and error levels in each period are given in the figure. The system has conducted a cycle count at the end of periodt-1, so there is no error in the system at the beginning of period t. The future cycle-count periods are{t+1,t+3,t+5,…}and the cycle-count periods are marked with the “Δ” symbol.Let us first focus on the nominal inventory variables shown in Fig. 1(a). We assume thatNIOP-(t)=NIL-(t)=10at the beginning of period t. Because the error in period t is not observed, NIOP and NIL change in the same way as do those in the standard base-stock policy with demand of two units, that is,NIOP-(t+1)=10andNIL-t+1)=8. In periodt+1, four units of demand is recorded and an accumulated error ofξ[t,t+2)=2is detected during the cycle count. Hence,NIL(t+1)=2. Finally, the stage places an order of six units to bringNIOP(t+1)=10, which is equal toNIOP-(t+2). The rest of the dynamics can be developed with the same logic. Clearly, the actual inventory dynamics are different because the nominal system does not realize that the error affects the physical inventory level in every period.Fig. 1(b) presents the corresponding actual inventory variables. At the beginning of periodt,AIOP-(t)=AIL-(t)=10. As a result of two units of demand and one unit of error, we haveAIL(t)=7. The stage orders two units according to the nominal inventory order position, and we getAIOP(t)=AIOP-(t+1)=9. Now, consider periodt+5. At the beginning of the period, the stage receives shipment of one unit sent at the end of periodt+2. Hence,AIL-(t+5)=AIL(t+4)+1=3. An error of two units and a demand of three units are realized during the period and we haveAIL(t+5)=-2. Depending on the sequence of the error and demand realization during the period, some or all of these two units of backlogs may be due to customer demand. We discuss later how we account for backlogs due to demand and error separately. At the beginning of periodt+6, the stage receives a shipment of five units andAIL-(t+6)=-2+5=3.We now show how to evaluate the average system cost per period. The inventory dynamics result in a regenerative process. Specifically, if the system conducts a cycle count at the end of periodt-1, the nominal inventory order position is set equal to the actual position at the beginning of period t, i.e.,NIOP-(t)=AIOP-(t). Because the errors are nonnegative, the nominal inventory terms are always greater than or equal to the actual terms. Hence, after a cycle count, the corrected nominal inventory position cannot be more than the target base-stock level s and the system can order up to the target level after aligning the nominal terms with the actual ones. In order to analyze this regenerative process that has a cycle length of T periods, we set the beginning of periodst,t+T,t+2T,…as the regenerative epochs. The long-run average cost per period is equal to the expected cost between two consecutive regenerative epochs divided by the cycle length. TheAIOP-in the cycle-count interval[t,t+T)determinesAIL-and AIL in[t+L,t+L+T)as follows.Proposition 1Forr=0,…,T-1,(1)NIOP-(t+r)=s,AIOP-(t+r)=s-ξt,t+r(2)AIL-(t+L+r)=AIOP-(t+r)-Dt+r,t+L+r-ξt+r,t+L+r,AIL(t+L+r)=AIOP-(t+r)-D[t+r,t+L+r]-ξ[t+r,t+L+r],andB(t+L+r)is binomially distributed with parameters[AIL(t+L+r)]-andλ/(λ+μ).The second equation is due to the replenishment policy that orders to cover the demand in the no-cycle-count periods and the demand and the accumulated error in the cycle-count period. The third and fourth equations are similar to those in the standard base-stock models and reflect the effect of the lead time. The last statement gives the distribution of backlogged customer demand given the total backlog level. From the moment AIL falls to zero until the end of the period, two Poisson processes reduce AIL, but only customer arrivals cause a backlog penalty. The process after AIL falls to zero is independent of the demand and error realizations before that point because of the memoryless property of the Poisson process. Hence, the fraction of total backlog that is due to customer demand follows a Binomial distribution with number of trials equal toAIL(t+L+r)-and success probability equal to the ratio of mean demand to mean error plus mean demand. Thus, the expected value ofB(t+L+r)givenAIL(t+L+r)is simply(λ/(λ+μ))AIL(t+L+r)-. This accounts for the system incurring the backorder penalty for only customer demands when the actual inventory level is less than or equal to zero, but not for the error process. In the example in Fig. 1, the actual inventory level in periodt+5is three units after replenishment and minus two units at the end of the period (after two units of error and three units of demand). The actual backlogged demand level, however, depends on the realized sequence of the error and demand occurrences. Proposition 1 tells us thatB(t+5)is distributed according a binomial distribution with parameters(2,λ/(λ+μ)).For expositional simplicity, definebˆ=bλ/(λ+μ). The average inventory cost per period is given byG(s,T)=1T∑r=0T-1EhAIL(t+L+r)++bB(t+L+r)=1T∑r=0T-1EhAIL(t+L+r)+(bˆ+h)AIL(t+L+r)-.The distribution ofAIL(t+L+r)is determined byAIOP-(t+r)given by (1). Note thatξ[t+⌊r/T⌋T,t+r)in that expression yields r periods of error forr=0,1,2,…,T-1. Defineg(y,r)=Eh(y-ξr-D[L]-ξ[L])+(bˆ+h)y-ξr-D[L]-ξL-.The average inventory cost per period,G(s,T), and the average total cost per period including the counting cost,C(s,T), can be expressed as follows.Proposition 2G(s,T)=(1/T)∑r=0T-1g(s,r)andC(s,T)=G(s,T)+K/T.Note that eachg(y,r)function is the same as a single-period inventory cost function with different demand variables. Because each of them is convex, average costG(s,T)is also convex in the base-stock level s for fixed T. Lets(T)=argminsC(s,T)be the optimal base-stock level. DefineG(T)=G(s(T),T)as the minimum inventory cost andC(T)=C(s(T),T)as the optimal total cost for a given cycle-count policy.Proposition 3ForT⩾2,(1)s(T-1)⩽s(T),(2)G(T-1)⩽G(T).Proposition 3 states that the optimal base-stock level and the optimal inventory cost increase with the cycle-count interval length T. When the cycle-count interval is longer, more periods of error accumulate in the system. Thus, the system has to maintain a higher stock level to cover the inventory loss and the additional uncertainty. The higher stock level leads to a higher optimal system cost. The impact of the cycle-count interval onC(T)depends on howK/Tcompares with inventory related costs.We now consider an N-stage series system. Customer demand occurs at stage 1. Stage 1 is replenished by stage 2, stage 2 by stage 3, and so on, and stage N by an outside source with ample supply. The lead time between stage j andj+1isLjperiods. LetL‾j=∑i=jNLi, the cumulative lead time from stage j to stage N. Each stage orders according to a local base-stock policy. At the beginning of a period, if stage j’s local inventory order position is lower than the base-stock levelsj, the stage places an order to raise its nominal inventory order position tosj; otherwise, the stage does not order. LetSj=def∑i=1jsi. DenoteDj[t,t+r)andDj[t,t+r]the local demand occurring in periods[t,t+r)and[t,t+r]for stage j, respectively. Note that under a local base-stock policy, stagej-1’s order is stage j’s local demand. A nonnegative random inventory loss, or error, occurs at each stage every period, reducing the physical inventory level. We assume that the error at stage j is Poisson with rateμjand is independent and identically distributed across periods. Also, the error process at a stage is independent of the other stages. Letξj[t,t+r)andξj[t,t+r]denote the accumulated error in periods[t,t+r)and[t,t+r]at stage j. We useξj[r)andξj[r]for the accumulated error of r andr+1periods in the long-run average cost calculations, respectively. Each stage conducts a cycle-count policy to correct its inventory record. LetTjbe the cycle-count interval for stage j andKjbe the counting cost at stage j. We let variables in bold font denote the vector of that variable forj=1,…,N. That is,s=(s1,…,sN),T=(T1,…,TN). Similarly forμ,L,h, andK.For stage 1, the sequence of events is the same as that for the single-stage system. For stagesj⩾2, the sequence of events is similar to stage 1. Specifically,(1)at the beginning of a period, stage j receives a shipment sentLjperiods ago,random error occurs during the period,downstream order (or local demand) arrives at the end of a period,stage j sends a shipment to stagej-1,stage j conducts a cycle count, if the current period is a cycle-count period,stage j places an order according to the nominal inventory order position at the end of a period,costs are evaluated based on the actual inventory level.Below we discuss how to evaluate the average total cost per period. In Section 4.1, we show how to evaluate the cost using local inventory variables. In Section 4.2, we provide an alternative approach, which evaluates the cost using the corresponding echelon variables. This echelon approach simplifies the computation significantly and sets the stage for the subsequent analysis.To explain how these events affect inventory variables, we define the following local inventory variables.AIOPj′-(t)=Actual local inventory order position at stagejat the beginning of periodt,AIOPj′(t)=Actual local inventory order position after ordering at stagejat the end of periodt,AILj′-(t)=Actual local inventory level at stagejat the beginning of periodtafter receiving a shipment placedLjperiods ago,AILj′(t)=Actual local inventory level at stagejat the end of periodt.The effect of the sequence of events on the actual inventory variables is as follows. In event (1), stage j receives a shipment, which raises the actual inventory level and determinesAILj′-(t). In event (2), the error reducesAIOPj′-(t)andAILj′-(t). In event (3), a downstream order (local demand) arrives, which reducesAIOPj′-(t). In event (4), stage j ships as much as possible to fulfill stagej-1’s order, andAILj′(t)is determined. In event (5), the nominal and actual local inventory variables are aligned after a cycle count is conducted. In event (6),AIOPj′(t)is determined after an order is placed. ThisAIOPj′level is carried over to the next period, i.e.,AIOPj′(t)=AIOPj′-(t+1). In event (7), costs are evaluated based onAILj′(t). Lethjdenote the echelon holding cost,hj′=∑i=jNhithe local holding cost for stage j, and b the backorder cost at stage 1. The inventory holding cost for stage j at the end of period t ishj′AILj′(t)+,j=1,…,N, and the expected cost of backlogged customer demand at stage 1 isbE[B(t)]=bˆAIL1′(t)-, wherebˆ=bλ/λ+μ1).We assume that all stages conduct a cycle count at the end of periodt-1. LetT=lcm{T1,…,TN}, wherelcm{}is an operator that generates the least common multiplier. The common cycle-count periods for all stages aret-1,t+T-1,t+2T-1,…. After a common cycle-count period, all stages have zero error. Thus, we set the beginning of periodst,t+T,t+2T,…as regenerative epochs. Without loss of generality, we will focus on a regenerative cycle consisting of periodst+r,r=0,1,…,T-1. For expositional simplicity, definerj=r+N-j,j=1,2,…,N.As we shall see,AIOPj′-(t+L‾j+1+rj)and the local demandDjwill jointly determine the actual local inventory levelAILj′(t+L‾j+rj)for stagej,j=N,N-1,…,1.To illustrate this, we first characterizeAIOPj′-. Similar to the expression for the order position for the single-stage system in (1), we need to adjust the order position down for the error accumulated in the system since the last inspection. Let⌊·⌋be the round-down operator. Under the considered inventory and cycle-count policy, we have(3)AIOPj′-(t+L‾j+1+rj)=sj-ξjt+(L‾j+1+rj)TjTj,t+L‾j+1+rj.We next characterize the local demandDjfor stage j. Note that the local demand for stage j is the order placed by stagej-1. Thus, we can sequentially characterize these local demands from stage 1, stage 2, etc., up to stage N. Let t be a regenerative epoch andℓbe any nonnegative integer. Clearly,D1t,t+ℓ=Dt,t+ℓ. For stagej=2,3,…,N,Djt,t+ℓ=Dj-1t,t+ℓ+ξj-1tTj-1Tj-1,t+ℓTj-1Tj-1.Dj[t,t+ℓ]=Dj-1[t,t+ℓ]+ξj-1tTj-1Tj-1,t+ℓ+1Tj-1Tj-1.As seen from these equations, stagej-1simply passes on all the orders it receives from downstream to upstream stage j and, in the cycle-count periods, the local errors that it observes (if any). With these local demands andAIOPj′-, we can characterizeAILj′(t+L‾j+rj)as we did for the single-stage system in (2). This process starts from stage N. Note that(4)AILN′-(t+LN+rN)=AIOPN′-(t+rN)-DNt+rN,t+LN+rN-ξNt+rN,t+LN+rN,(5)AILN′(t+LN+rN)=AIOPN′-(t+rN)-DN[t+rN,t+LN+rN]-ξN[t+rN,t+LN+rN].It is more difficult to characterizeAILj′(t+L‾j+rj),j<N, because stage j may not always receive what it orders. To reflect this fact, we define the following inventory terms:AIPj′-(t)=actual local inventory in-transit position at the beginning of periodtafter a shipment is received;AIPj′(t)=actual local inventory in-transit position at the end of periodt.Now, consider stagej(<N)at the end of periodt+L‾j+1+rj+1. If stagej+1has fulfilled stage j’s order in this period,AIPj′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1)=AIOPj′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1).On the other hand, if stagej+1does not have sufficient stock to fulfill stage j’s order, then stagej+1has a backlog. In this case,AILj+1′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1)<0and(6)AIPj′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1)=AIOPj′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1)+AILj+1′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1).Note that the backlog may be due to the error and local demand at stagej+1. The above equation suggests that this backlog reduces the actual inventory in-transit position at stage j.2This is because of the assumption that errors can occur when stage j+1’s actual inventory level is non-positive. When the backlog at stage j+1 is filled after receiving a shipment in subsequent periods,AIPj′will be restored back toAIOPj′.2Combining these two cases together, we have(7)AIPj′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1)=AIOPj′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1)+min0,AILj+1′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1),or equivalently,(8)AIPj′-(t+L‾j+1+rj)=AIOPj′-(t+L‾j+1+rj)+min{0,AILj+1′(t+L‾j+1+rj+1)}.Given the distribution ofAIPj′-(t+L‾j+1+rj), we can characterize the distribution of future inventory levels similarly to stage N. We have(9)AILj′-(t+L‾j+rj)=AIPj′-(t+L‾j+1+rj)-Djt+L‾j+1+rj,t+L‾j+rj-ξjt+L‾j+1+rj,t+L‾j+rj,(10)AILj′(t+L‾j+rj)=AIPj′-(t+L‾j+1+rj)-Dj[t+L‾j+1+rj,t+L‾j+rj]-ξj[t+L‾j+1+rj,t+L‾j+rj].In summary, we can characterizeAILj′(t+L‾j+rj)through (3), (8), (9) and ( 10) recursively, starting from stage N to stage 1. We are able to characterizeAILj′(t)for any period t by repeating this process for all regenerative cycles. The average inventory cost per period is(11)G(s,T)=1T∑r=0T-1E∑j=1Nhj′(AILj′(t+r))++hj′ITj-1(t+r)+bˆ(AIL1′(t+r))-,whereITj-1(t)is the total inventory in transit to stagej-1at the end of period t, andIT0(t)≡0. Because all customer demand will be fulfilled and all errors will be recovered,E[ITj-1(t)]=(E[D]+∑i=1j-1E[ξi])Lj-1.We end this section with a connection to the literature on the bullwhip phenomenon. Lee, Padmanabhan, and Whang (1997) demonstrate four reasons that can lead to the bullwhip effect in supply chains. The above characterization of the local demand for each stage indicates that the mean and variance ofDjare larger than those ofDj-1. Furthermore, the increase in variance is larger if cycle-count interval of stage(j-1)is longer. Thus, inventory loss across locations in a supply chain is another factor that may contribute to the bullwhip effect.The above procedure to obtain the total cost per period and the computation is quite complicated because we need to compute the distribution of the local demandDjfor all stages and periods. We next provide a simple echelon scheme to evaluate the total system cost. This scheme allows us to bypass the computation of the distribution ofDj. Below we define the echelon inventory variables and present the relationships between the local and echelon inventory variables. These relationships are standard and can be found in Zipkin (2000).AIOPj-(t)=Actual echelon inventory-order position at stagejat the beginning of periodt=∑i=1jAIOPi′-(t),AILj-(t)=Actual echelon inventory level at stagejat the beginning of periodt=AILj′-(t)+∑i=1j-1AIOPi′-(t),AILj(t)=Actual echelon inventory level at stagejat the end of periodt,AIPj-(t)=Actual echelon inventory in-transit position at stagejat the beginning of periodt,=AIPj′-(t)+∑i=1j-1AIOPi′-(t).The expression forAILj(t)can be similarly established by removing “–” in the variables in the equation forAILj-(t).With these definitions, the total cost per periodG(s,T)in (11) can be expressed as follows.(12)G(s,T)=1T∑r=0T-1E∑j=1NhjAILj(t+r)+bˆ+h1′(AIL1(t+r))-.Note that this is equal to(13)G(s,T)=1T∑r=0T-1E∑j=1NhjAILj(t+L‾j+rj)+bˆ+h1′(AIL1(t+L‾1+r1))-.The only difference between the above cost functions above is that the time index for stage j is shifted byL‾j+rj-rperiods in the second equation. Nevertheless, every period is evaluated exactly once and the long-run average total cost per period is the same with either formulation.Our next task is to provide a simple recursion to obtainAILj(t+L‾j+rj). From the relationship between the local variables given by (8)–(10) and the definitions of echelon variables, we can derive the following.Proposition 4Forj=N,N-1,…,1,(14)AIPj-(t+L‾j+1+rj)=minAIOPj-(t+L‾j+1+rj),AILj+1(t+L‾j+1+rj+1),(15)AILj-(t+L‾j+rj)=AIPj-(t+L‾j+1+rj)-Dt+L‾j+1+rj,t+L‾j+rj-∑i=1jξit+L‾j+1+rj,t+L‾j+rj,(16)AILj(t+L‾j+rj)=AIPj-(t+L‾j+1+rj)-D[t+L‾j+1+rj,t+L‾j+rj]-∑i=1jξi[t+L‾j+1+rj,t+L‾j+rj],whereL‾N+1=0andAILN+1-(t+r)=∞.GivenAIOPj-(t+L‾j+1+rj), we can use Proposition 4 to obtainAIPj-(t+L‾j+1+rj), which further determinesAILj-andAILjin periodt+L‾j+rj. From (3) and the definition of the echelon order position, we get(17)AIOPj-(t+L‾j+1+rj)=∑i=1jAIOPi′-(t+L‾j+1+rj)=Sj-∑i=1jξit+(L‾j+1+rj)/TiTi,t+L‾j+1+rj.Thus, with Proposition 4 and (17), we can obtain the total cost in Eq. (13).Below we provide a bottom-up recursion to evaluate the total cost per period. The idea is to recursively evaluate the cost for echelon j, forj=1,…,Nby assuming that echelon j has ample supply from its upstream stage. Define the following notation to represent the number of errors accumulated since the last cycle count at stage j.MTj(ℓ)=t+ℓ-t+ℓTjTj.This notation yields the number of periods since the last cycle count at stage j, given a regenerative epoch t and a time length ofℓperiods.Proposition 5Forr=0,1,2,…,T-1, define(18)g1(y,r)=E[h1(y-ξ1MT1(L‾2+r1)-D[L1]-ξ1[L1])+(bˆ+h1′)y-ξ1MT1(L‾2+r1)-D[L1]-ξ1[L1]-].Forj=2,…,Nandr=0,1,2,…,T-1, define(19)gj(y,r)=Ehjy-∑i=1jξi[MTi(L‾j+1+rj))-D[Lj]-∑i=1jξi[Lj]gj-1minSj-1,y-∑i=1jξi[MTi(L‾j+1+rj))+∑i=1j-1ξi[MTi(L‾j+rj-1))-D[Lj]-∑i=1jξi[Lj],r.Then,G(s,T)=(1/T)∑r=0T-1gN(SN,r)andC(s,T)=∑j=1NKjTj+G(s,T).The recursion in the proposition enables us to easily evaluate the system cost for a given set of base-stock levels. In the next section, we use this recursion to generate a heuristic solution for the optimal base-stock levels and develop a lower bound on the optimal cost.The above bottom-up recursion is similar to that for the classic multi-echelon inventory problem (e.g., Chen, 1999; Chen & Zheng, 1994). However, unlike the classic problem, the optimal solution cannot be obtained by minimizing(1/T)∑r=0T-1gj(Sj,r)recursively. The reason is as follows. In the first stage, eachg1(y,r)function is convex, but we choose a singleS1that minimizes∑r=0T-1g1(S1,r). In the second stage,g2(y,r)callsg1(min{S1,y},r), andg2is no longer convex, becauseS1is not the minimizer of individualg1(y,r)functions. As a result, we cannot guarantee the convexity or unimodality of the functionsgj(y,r)forj⩾2. In Section 5.1, we derive a lower bound on the total cost per period for any local base-stock policy. In Section 5.2, we present a heuristic algorithm based on the recursion above. As we shall show in a numerical study, the heuristic solution is near-optimal and therefore can be used to draw insights about supply chains with inventory record inaccuracy.We establish a lower bound to the total cost under any local base-stock policy, i.e., a lower bound to the minimal cost that can be achieved. We compute the lower bound by replacingSjin (19) with the minimizer of eachgj(y,r)function, which yields convex cost functions at each recursion step. Define a series ofg̲jfunctions recursively: Letg̲1(y,r)=g1(y,r)and(20)S1(r)=argminyg̲1(y,r).Defineg̲1,1(y,r)=g̲1(y,r),ify⩽S1(r)g̲1(S1(r),r),otherwise.Note thatg̲1,1(y,r)function is decreasing and convex ify⩽S1(r)and is constant ify>S1(r). Also,g̲1,1(y,r)=g̲1(min{S1(r),y},r).With these definitions, the inventory cost part of the total cost in (13) can be expressed as(21)G(s,T)=1T∑r=0T-1E∑j=2NhjAILj(t+L‾j+rj)+g̲1AIP1-(t+L‾2+r1)+ξ1[MT1(L‾2+r1)),r⩾1T∑r=0T-1E∑j=2NhjAILj(t+L‾j+rj)+g̲1,1AIP1-(t+L‾2+r1)+ξ1[MT1(L‾2+r1)),r⩾1T∑r=0T-1E∑j=2NhjAILj(t+L‾j+rj)+g̲1,1AIL2(t+L‾2+r2)+ξ1[MT1(L‾2+r1)),r=1T∑r=0T-1E∑j=2NhjAILj(t+L‾j+rj)+g̲1minS1(r),(AIL2(t+L‾2+r2)+ξ1[MT1(L‾2+r1))),r.The first equality follows from (16) and (18). The last inequality holds becauseAIL2(t+L‾2+r2)⩾AIP1-(t+L‾2+r1)andg̲1,1is a decreasing function.Forj=2,…,N-1, suppose thatSj-1(r)is known. We substituteSj-1(r)forSj-1in (19), and define the resulting function asg̲j(y,r). In this case, because we are replacingSj-1(r), the minimizer of each individual function, ingj-1(min{Sj-1,y},r), the resultingg̲j(y,r)functions are convex in y. LetSj(r)=argminyg̲j(y,r).Defineg̲j,j(y,r)=g̲j(y,r),ify⩽Sj(r)g̲j(Sj(r),r),otherwise.Also,g̲j,j(y,r)=g̲j(min{Sj(r),y}),r).With these definitions, (21) can be continued as(21)=1T∑r=0T-1E∑j=3NhjAILj(t+L‾j+rj)+g̲2AIP2-(t+L‾3+r2)+ξ2[MT2(L‾3+r2)),r⩾…=1T∑r=0T-1EhN(AILN(t+LN+rN))+g̲N-1minSN-1(r),AILN(t+L‾N+rN)+∑i=1N-1ξi[MTiL‾N+rN-1)),r=1T∑r=0T-1g̲N(SN,r).Clearly,(1/T)∑r=0T-1g̲N(SN,r)is convex. DefineSN∗=argminSN∑r=0T-1g̲N(SN,r).DefineC̲(T)=def∑j=1NKjTj+1T∑r=0T-1g̲N(SN∗,r). This provides a lower bound to the optimal total supply chain cost given the class of static local base-stock policies, that is,C̲(T)⩽C(s,T)for anys. This lower-bound cost function reduces to the one in Chen and Zheng (1994) when there are no errors in the system. Proposition 6 summarizes these results.Proposition 6For fixedT,(1)g̲j(y,r)is convex in y, forj=1,…,N.C̲(T)is a lower bound onC(s,T)for anys.In summary, we can use the recursion defined in (18) and (19) to obtain the lower bound. For stage 1, setg̲1(y,r)=g1(y,r)and letS1(r)=argminyg̲1(y,r). Forj=2,…,N-1, suppose thatSj-1(r)is known. We substituteSj-1(r)forSj-1in (19), and define the resulting function asg̲j(y,r)and letSj(r)=argminyg̲j(y,r). We computeg̲N(y,r)function withSN-1(r)and setSN∗=argminy1T∑r=0T-1g̲N(y,r). The lower bound is given byC̲(T).The lower bound cost is strictly less than the optimal total cost because we are not able to find a singleSjto representSj(r)in each iteration during the construction of the lower bound. We present an algorithm that recursively solves (18) and (19) to obtain a heuristic solutionS∼j. Specifically, letg̃1(y,r)=g1(y,r),g‾1(y)=∑r=0T-1g̃1(y,r), andS∼1=argminyg‾1(y).Forj=2,…,N, suppose thatS∼j-1is known. We substituteS∼j-1forSj-1in (19), and define the resulting function asg̃j(y,r). We defineg‾j(y)=∑r=0T-1g̃j(y,r)and find its first minimizer,S∼j. Becauseg‾j(y)is not necessarily convex, we findS∼jvia a line search. The heuristic solution is given bys̃1=S∼1,s̃j=S∼j-S∼j-1,j=2,…,N.DefineC(T)=C(s̃,T), as the heuristic cost. Notice that the proposed heuristic generates the optimal base-stock level for stage 1 becauseg‾1(y)is convex, andg‾1(s̃1)=∑rg1(s̃1,r)gives the minimum possible cost for stage 1. The heuristic also generates the exact optimal solution whenTj=1forj<N, because the resulting heuristic cost is equal to the lower bound cost.We now provide an analytical result on the impact of cycle-count policy for a two-stage system.Theorem 1For a two-stage system with identical error distribution and identical counting costs at both stages (i.e.,μ1=μ2andK1=K2), we haveC(1,T)<C(T,1)forT>1.Theorem 1 states that it is more effective to conduct more frequent cycle counts at a downstream stage for a two-stage system with identical error distributions. Intuitively, when stage 1 conducts a cycle count, it will order the demand plus the error from stage 2. From the perspective of stage 2, this error will reduce stage 2’s inventory position in the same fashion as if it had conducted a cycle count and the same amount of error was identified. Thus, conducting a cycle count at stage 1 essentially mitigates the impact of error at both stages. This result holds for any(L1,L2)and(h1,h2). In addition, this result holds for anyK1⩽K2, but may not hold otherwise, depending on the scale of counting costs relative to the scale of inventory costs. Notice that Theorem 1 holds for the optimal base-stock levels, because the heuristic yields the optimal base-stock level for stage 1, and the proof shows the result for any echelon inventory level y in the stage 2 cost function. This result demonstrates that, all else being equal, more attention should be paid to the downstream location. Nevertheless, designing an effective cycle-count policy requires an understanding of how the relative impact changes with supply chain properties such as the lead times and the supply chain length. We conduct a numerical study to answer these questions in Section 6.This section provides a numerical study to investigate how system parameters affect cycle-count policies. These numerical observations will lead to guidelines for designing effective cycle-count policies.We use our heuristic base-stock policy to answer these questions through a sensitivity analysis study. We focus our discussion on both two-stage and four-stage systems. The parameters we use in the sensitivity analysis are as follows: For the two-stage system, the parameters3We tested another set of experiment with normal demand and error distributions. All the subsequent insights remain valid. For the normal distribution case, we assume that the error and demand distributions are i.i.d between periods, and an error occurs at the beginning of a period, followed by the demand.3areλ=20,(h1,h2)∈{(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)},(L1,L2)∈{(1,5),(3,3),(5,1)},(μ1,μ2)∈(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,2),Kj∈2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30for allj.These parameters are chosen to represent various supply chain configurations. In addition, we consider three service levelsα={0.8,0.9,0.95}, and setbˆ=(h1+h2)α/(1-α). Finally, we consider the following 16 cycle-count policies:(T1,T2)∈(1,1),(1,3),(3,1),(1,6),(6,1),(1,12),(12,1),(2,2),(2,4),(3,3),(2,12),(4,4),(3,12),(6,6),(6,12),(12,12).The largest cycle-count interval, 12, corresponds to annual inventory counts if the inventory review period is a month.For the four-stage system, the parameters areλ=20,h∈{(1,1,3,3),(2,2,2,2),(3,3,1,1)},L∈{(1,1,5,5),(3,3,3,3),(5,5,1,1)},μ∈(1,1,1,1),(1,1,2,1),K=(10,10,10,10).In addition, we setbˆ=72, representing 90% service level. For this test, we consider 36 cycle-count policies listed in Table 1ranging from(1,1,1,1)to(12,12,12,12).We first verify the effectiveness of our heuristic solution under the above chosen parameters. We define the percentage difference between the heuristic cost and the lower bound cost asC(s̃,T)-C̲(T)C̲(T)×100%.In this study, we find that the average difference is 0.22% and 0.65% for the two-stage systems with error rates(1,1)and with error rates(2,2), respectively. The average difference is 0.29% for four-stage systems. We conclude that our heuristic base-stock levels are near optimal. We therefore use it to answer the above research questions.The purpose of the sensitivity analysis study is to examine the impact of varying one specific parameter on the total cost. Therefore, we need to select a base case as a reference point. We select the following two-stage system as our base case:μ=(1,1),L=(3,3),h=(2,2),K=(10,10), andbˆ=36. Similarly, we choose the following base case for the four-stage system:μ=(1,1,1,1),L=(3,3,3,3),h=(2,2,2,2),K=(10,10,10,10), andbˆ=72. We measure the impact of cycle-count policies by computing the percentage reduction in the optimal cost relative to the worst case,C(12,…,12), which has minimal correction of errors. DefineΔ(T)=C(12,…,12)-C(T)C(12,…,12)×100%.For simplicity, we useT′≻T″to denote that a cycle-count policyT′achieves more percentage cost reduction than policyT″. Clearly, different parameter sets may lead to larger or smaller magnitude of the effects. However, we are interested more in the insights obtained by observing the direction of the change in the total cost in response to the system parameters.We summarize main observations from the numerical study below. Notice that a curve in Figs. 2–7is obtained by starting with a base case and changing only the variable specified in the horizontal axis. For example, in Fig. 2, the “diamond” shape curve shows the cost reduction for the four-stage base case under different cycle-count policies; the “square” shape curve shows the same when we increase the error rate at stage 3 in the same four-stage case.1.Fig. 2 shows the impact of conducting cycle counts on different locations in four-stage systems. We find that the result in Theorem 1 holds for longer supply chains as well: With identical error rates and counting costs, a downstream cycle count is more effective than an upstream cycle count. A cycle count at an upstream stage could be more beneficial to the system only when the error rate at that location is significantly higher than the downstream locations.Fig. 3 shows the benefit of conducting cycle counts under various lead time ratios for the two-stage base case. We particularly consider two cycle-count policies:(T1,T2)=(1,12)and (12,1). The former (the latter) represents conducting more frequent counts at stage 1 (stage 2). From the top curve, we observe that the benefit of cycle counts at the downstream location decreases as the share of the downstream lead time increases. Since a shorter lead time implies less stock, this result suggests that a leaner downstream stage is more vulnerable to the error.Fig. 4(a) and (b) illustrate the two conclusions observed above for the four-stage base system.The benefit of cycle counts at a location increases if the ratio of the holding cost to the total holding cost increases. Intuitively, when the holding cost is larger, the stage will carry less inventory, making the impact of errors more significant.Fig. 5 illustrates the impact of cycle counts on the number of stages for bothN=2andN=4cases. To make a fair comparison, we change the lead time parameters of the two-stage system by settingL=(6,6)andh=(4,4). This ensures that total lead time and total holding cost of two-stage system are the same as the four-stage system. We find that the impact of conducting cycle count at the most upstream stage relative to the impact of conducting cycle counts at stage 1 forN=4(i.e., 0.1–1.2%) is smaller than that forN=2(i.e., 2.1–3.5%). This observation suggests that cycle counts should be focused on both stage 1 and stage 2 (on stage 1) whenN=4(N=2). Thus, a rough guideline based on this conclusion for systems with similar error rates and counting costs is that cycle counts should be focused more on the downstream half of the supply chain.Fig. 6 shows the marginal benefit of assigning more than one cycle count for the base example. Starting fromT=(12,12), we changeT1(T2)only to increase the downstream (upstream) counts. As shown, both upstream and downstream counts exhibit diminishing rates of return. More importantly, the first additional upstream cycle count may be more beneficial to the system than the third additional downstream count. This result immediately suggests that it is not a good strategy to allocate all cycle counts to a single location. Instead, cycle counts should be allocated across locations in a dynamic way.Based on observation 6, an effective cycle-count policy must assign the first few cycle counts downstream but then keep a reasonably balanced allocation of the total cycle counts available. Fig. 7(a) shows that(2,2)≻(1,12), where the former has 12 counts and the latter has 13 counts per year. (Note that this comparison holds even whenK1=K2=0, indicating that the difference is mostly due to the inventory costs.) Hence, a balanced policy is usually better than a policy that heavily favors downstream locations. Nevertheless, we know that as the downstream lead time share decreases downstream counts have a larger impact. Fig. 7(b) compares policies(4,12)and(6,6), both with four counts per year. While(6,6)≻(4,12)whenL1/(L1+L2)⩾1/2, we have(4,12)≻(6,6)as that ratio decreases. Hence, the balance should be tilted slightly towards downstream locations in supply chains with short downstream lead times. These guidelines carry over to longer supply chains.The above observations are drawn from the base cases, in which each stage has identical counting cost. Clearly, stage counting costs directly affect cycle-count decisions. While observation 1 suggests that downstream counts are more beneficial to the system when counting costs are identical, the result will be reversed if downstream counting costs are significantly higher than upstream counting costs. Table 1 illustrates the optimal cycle-count policies for various counting cost combinations in a two-stage system. The optimal cycle-count policy is obtained by searching over all 36 feasible policies withTj∈{1,2,3,4,6,12}. For example, as shown in the table, the best cycle-count policy for the base case example withK1=K2=10isT=(4,6). AsK1increases, downstream cycle-count frequency decreases. To compensate for that, the upstream cycle-count frequency may increase. Similarly, asK2increases, upstream cycle-count frequency decreases and downstream cycle-count frequency generally increases. Note that it is optimal to count more frequently at the upstream stage rather than the downstream stage only whenK2is significantly lower thanK1. In most cases, even whenK1/K2>2, it is optimal to count more frequently downstream, indicating that location in the supply chain should play a very significant role in counting decisions. In addition, the optimal cycle-count policy is(4,6)for the base case and a wide range of counting costs around that, indicating that optimal cycle-count policy is not very sensitive to the counting cost structure.Based on these observations, we categorize the factors that affect cycle-count decisions into two groups. Primary factors determine which stages should get priority (i.e., higher cycle-count frequency). These factors are(i)stage (position in the supply chain)(ii)error rate, and(iii)counting cost. Secondary factors determine whether the policy should strongly favor the high-priority stages or allocate counts in a somewhat balanced way. These are(i)lead time structure,(ii)holding cost structure, and(iii)the length of the supply chain.These two groups of factors can be used to provide the following guidelines for designing effective cycle-count policies. When allocating a fixed budget or a fixed number of cycle countsin a supply chain, a manager should first consider primary factors by allocating first few cycle counts to downstream locations and locations with significantly higher error rate or low counting cost. Then, the manager should consider the secondary factors to allocate the remaining cycle counts. For example, if the ratio of the lead time of a downstream stage to the total system lead time is large, the manager should allocate the remaining cycle counts to keep a more balanced distribution rather than focusing on the downstream stage. On the other hand, if the supply chain is long, the manager should allocate the remaining counts to favor the few downstream stages.Finally, our model and analysis also provide implications on RFID investments from the perspective of reducing inventory inaccuracy. Consider the following settings with RFID.(i)In some settings with tagged products, RFID provides perpetual information in locations where readers are installed. This scenario can be evaluated with our framework. For example, for a production line at a factory with a six-stage process, a reader in stages 3 and 5 is equivalent to a cycle-count policy(12,12,1,12,1,12).(ii)In some other settings, the cost of readers may be small relative to the cost of RFID tags. In that case, the problem is to decide the at which stage the tags should be put on the products. For example, if stage 3 and its downstream stages have tagged products, this is equivalent to policy(1,1,1,12,12,12).(iii)In the apparel industry, it is common to use hand-held RFID readers to do cycle-counts. In this case, the store staff performs cycle counts using the handheld readers near shelves or hangers. These cycle counts are faster (less costly) and possibly more accurate than manual counts. Our results on cycle-count policies are directly relevant for this setting. RFID investment determines which stages have relatively low counting costs and therefore count more often. In any of these scenarios, a supply chain manager needs to do a cost-benefit analysis for the RFID investment. It has been suggested in the literature that from the perspective of labor cost savings, upstream stages (back-end operations) should be RFID-enabled first (Chopra & Sodhi, 2007). Our results suggest that, from the perspective of record inaccuracy, all else being equal, downstream stages should get priority.
