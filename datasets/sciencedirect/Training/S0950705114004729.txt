@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The proliferation of smart phones has opened up new kinds of data to model human behavior and predict future activity but this prediction can be tempered by the relative sparsity of data. In this paper, we integrate a time-dependent instance transfer mechanism, driven by a hybrid similarity measure, into learning and predicting human behavior. In particular, transfer component analysis (TCA) is utilized for domain adaptation from different data types to overcome data sparsity. The hybrid user similarity measure is developed based on three different characteristics: eigen-behavior, longest common behavior (LCB), and daily common behavior (DCB). Extensive comparisons are made against state-of-the-art time series prediction algorithms using the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge (MDC) dataset and the MIT Reality Mining dataset. We compare the prediction performance given (i) no additional data, (ii) only data from identical behavior from other users, and (iii) data from any type of behavior from other users. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of behavior prediction.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The way in which we engage socially and with our entertainment has been revolutionized recently with the rapid expansion of modern communication technologies. Mobile internet-connected devices are increasingly important constantly-available tools for searching information, connecting with friends, and consuming content [1,2]. The manner in which we engage with these devices can yield valuable information about personal behaviors including where we spend our time, how we interact socially, and how we consume media. This information, in turn, can be tremendously useful in the modeling of our personal preferences for the purposes of directed marketing, which is a key reason that companies such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google are developing inference algorithms that can combine and analyze behavioral data [3,4].In our previous paper [5], we went in depth about the behavior prediction task based on the repetitive properties of human behavior. One challenge for behavior and activity prediction is the lack of sufficient individual data for relevant activities. In such cases, the target users do not have enough consecutive measurements. An important goal is therefore to robustly reconstruct or synthesize these missing data.This paper describes how the data shortage problem is overcome by the transfer of information between different persons for future behavior prediction. First, we investigate the possibility of mining useful patterns from historical records and present a preliminary framework for future behavior prediction. Then, we provide a detailed analysis of behavior similarity and the use of both “same-behavior” and “different-behavior” data from mobile device users to improve personalized behavior prediction. A hybrid similarity measure is proposed which makes use of eigen-behavior distance [6] and common behavior analysis. In particular, we propose integrating a time-dependent direct instance transfer mechanism into the sequential behavioral learning/prediction paradigm.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we propose a general knowledge transfer strategy that integrates a time-dependent instance transfer mechanism, driven by a hybrid similarity measure, into learning and predicting sequential human behavior. In particular, transfer component analysis (TCA) is utilized for domain adaptation from different data types to overcome data sparsity in a sequential prediction setting. The hybrid user similarity measure is developed based on three different characteristics: eigen-behavior, longest common behavior (LCB), and daily common behavior (DCB). Extensive comparisons are made against state-of-the-art time series prediction algorithms using the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge (MDC) dataset and the MIT Reality Mining dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed instance transfer algorithm significantly improves the performance of behavior prediction up to 89.94% accuracy.The proposed knowledge transfer algorithm is not based on any special assumption of the data and therefore could be easily applied to any data types. The present work focuses mainly on ‘high level’ prediction of future behaviors over hourly intervals. Future work will focus on simultaneous-behavior prediction, where different behavior records can be processed jointly.As mentioned in Section 4.4, when transferring data from source domainXSof sizen1to target domainXTof sizen2, this first embeds the behavior data in a kernel matrix,K, defined in Eq. (A.1).(A.1)K=KS,SKS,TKT,SKT,TwhereKS,S,KT,T, andKS,Tare the Gram matrices defined on the source domain, target domain, and cross-domain data in the embedded space, respectively.By using the empirical kernel mapK=KK-1/2K-1/2K, the resultant kernel matrix is(A.2)K∼=KK-1/2W∼W∼TK-1/2K=KWWTKwhereW=K-1/2W∼. The maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) distance between the empirical means of source domain and target domain can be calculated as [23](A.3)Dst(XS,XT)=trKWWTKL=trWTKLKWwhereLijis defined as(A.4)Lij=1/n12xi,xj∈XS1/n22xi,xj∈XT1/n1n2otherwiseThe variance of the projected samples can be calculated as(A.5)σ2(XS,XT)=WTKHKWwhereH=In1+n2-(1/n1+n2)11Tis the centering matrix,1is the column vector with all 1’s,In1+n2is the identity matrix [23].TCA minimizes the distance between the empirical means of the two domains, while maximizing the the variance of the projected samples, shown in Eq.
