@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper deals with the problem of global asymptotic stability of fixed-point state-space digital filters under various combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities and for the situation where quantization occurs after summation only. Utilizing the structural properties of the nonlinearities in greater detail, a new global asymptotic stability criterion is proposed. A unique feature of the presented approach is that it exploits the information about the maximum normalized quantization error of the quantizer and the maximum representable number for a given wordlength. The approach leads to an enhanced stability region in the parameter-space, as compared to several previously reported criteria.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Due to a broad range of applications of digital filters in many areas such as telecommunications, speech processing, image processing, medical electronics, geophysics, control systems, spectrum and vibration analyses, adaptive and tracking systems, etc., the design and analysis of various types of filters have received considerable attention [1–10] over the past few decades.In the implementation of a stable and linear recursive digital filter using finite wordlength processors with fixed-point arithmetic, nonlinearities are introduced owing to the quantization and overflow [11,12]. Quantization nonlinearities in digital filters usually take one of the following three forms: magnitude truncation, round off and value truncation. The usual types of overflow nonlinearities employed in practice are zeroing, triangular, two's complement and saturation overflow characteristics. Due to the presence of such nonlinearities, the filter may exhibit unstable behavior (e.g., granular limit cycles, overflow oscillations etc.). When dealing with the design and implementation of fixed-point state-space digital filters, it is essential to have a criterion for choosing the values of the filter coefficients so that the designed filter is free of limit cycles. If the digital filter is implemented on a digital hardware with sufficiently long wordlength, the effects of quantization and overflow may be treated as decoupled or mutually independent [11,12]. Under this decoupling approximation, a number of researchers have studied quantization effects in digital filters without considering overflow effects [13–18], while others have investigated overflow effects in the absence of quantization [19–32]. On the other hand, several researchers have also queried the validity of decoupling approximation [33,34].The study of the stability properties of digital filters under the combined effects of quantization and overflow nonlinearities appears to be more realistic due to the fact that the operations of practical digital filters take place in presence of both types of nonlinearities [35–41]. The problem of global asymptotic stability of fixed-point state-space digital filters with combinations of quantization and overflow has attracted the attention of a few researchers [35–41]. A few computationally simple criteria have been reported in [38] under which the global asymptotic stability of a system involving quantization and overflow nonlinearities is shown to be equivalent to the global asymptotic stability of that with only quantization nonlinearities. The key idea of [38] is based on the determination of stability regions where overflow cannot occur. In practice, the results in [38] are helpful to determine the stability of digital filters with combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities using available stability information for digital filters with only quantization nonlinearities. Ref. [40] presents improved versions of some of the stability results given in [38]. An alternative approach for stability analysis of digital filters with various combinations of quantization (except value truncation) and overflow nonlinearities has also been established in [40]. The state-space criterion in [40] is based on the sector information of the combined quantization and overflow nonlinearities where overflow nonlinearities are assumed for every state in the system. However, when dealing with the dynamic behavior of digital filters in presence of finite wordlength nonlinearities, it is worth noticing that all the states in the system may not reach to the overflow level. Depending on the values of system parameters, [41] makes distinction between the nonlinearities operating as composite nonlinearities and those operating as only quantization nonlinearities. The criterion in [41] has been derived using a more precise characterization of the nonlinearities as compared to [40] and, therefore, [41] turns out to be an improvement over [40]. It may be observed that [41] utilizes only the values of system parameters in order to identify the nonlinearities operating in the quantization region but ignores the information about the maximum normalized quantization error of the quantizer and the maximum representable number for a given wordlength. Consequently, there still remains scope for characterizing the composite nonlinearities properly with a view to achieve enhanced stability region in the parameter-space.Motivated by the preceding discussion, in this paper, we revisit the problem of global asymptotic stability of fixed-point state-space digital filters under the influence of various combinations of quantization and overflow. Larger the global asymptotic stability region in the parameter-space of a digital filter, greater would be the flexibility to choose the filter coefficients. It remains a challenge to reduce the conservatism of the existing criteria for testing the stability of digital filters, particularly in the presence of both quantization and overflow. Therefore, we aim to develop an approach which may lead to less conservative stability conditions than those in [38,40,41]. Inspired by the works of [30,31], an improved method for extracting the composite nonlinearities which effectively operate only in quantization region is developed. This method not only captures the information of the dynamical behavior of the system more efficiently as compared to [41] but also makes use of the information about the maximum normalized quantization error of the quantizer and the maximum representable number for a given wordlength. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the notations used in this paper and introduces the system under consideration along with the existing criteria. A new sufficient condition for the nonexistence of limit cycles in fixed-point state-space digital filters under various combinations of quantization and overflow is established in Section 3. In Section 4, a comparison of the proposed criterion with previously reported criteria [38,40,41] is made in order to establish the significance of the present approach. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 5.The following notations are used throughout in this paper:Rp×qset ofp×qreal matricesset ofp×1real vectorsi-th entry of a vectorxlist of coordinate indexes, which we regard as a subset of{1,2,…,n}; the subscript k refers to the iteration numbernumber of indexes inJkcomplement set ofJksuch thatJk∪Jkc={1,2,…,n}; the superscript c stands for the complementthe vector which consists ofxi's withi∈Jksubmatrix ofMcomposed ofMi,j's with(i,j)belonging toJk×Jksubmatrix ofMcomposed ofMi,j's with(i,j)belonging toJk×Jkcnull setidentity matrix of order nn×1vector with all elements being equal to 1null matrix or null vector of appropriate dimensionmaximum normalized quantization errormaximum representable number for a given wordlengthspectral radius of a matrixAset of positive integerssuperscript ‘T’ refers to the transposediagonal matrix with diagonal elementsd11,d22,…,dnnBis positive definite symmetric matrixThe system under consideration is represented by(1a)x(r+1)=O{Q(y(r))}=[O1{Q1(y1(r))}O2{Q2(y2(r))}…On{Qn(yn(r))}]T=[f1(y1(r))f2(y2(r))…fn(yn(r))]T=f(y(r)),(1b)y(r)=Ax(r),wherex(r)∈Rndenotes the state vector,A=[aij]∈Rn×nthe coefficient matrix,Q(.)the quantization nonlinearities,O(.)the overflow nonlinearities andf(.)is the composite nonlinear function. In the event ofQ(.)being either magnitude truncation or roundoff, the composite nonlinearitiesfi(yi(r)),i=1,2,…,n, involved in (1) may be viewed as confined to the sector [Ko,Kq], i.e.,(2a)fi(0)=0,Koyi2(r)⩽fi(yi(r))yi(r)⩽Kqyi2(r),i=1,2,…,n,where(2b)Ko={0,for zeroing or saturation−1/3,for triangular−1,for two's complement(2c)Kq={1,for magnitude truncation2,for round off.It is assumed that the infinite precision counterpart of the system is stable, i.e.,(3)det(zIn−A)≠0,∀|z|⩾1.Note that quantization nonlinearities satisfy(4)|ei(r)|=|Qi(yi(r))−yi(r)|⩽δ,i=1,2,…,n,wheree(r)=Q(y(r))−y(r)is the quantization error vector and δ represents the maximum normalized quantization error. Due to overflow bound in (1a), it follows that(5)|xi(r)|⩽Nmax,i=1,2,…,n,whereNmaxis the maximum representable number for a given wordlength.Eqs. (1)–(3) represent a class of digital filters with different combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities where quantization occurs after summation only. The problem is to choose the multipliersaij,i,j=1,2,…,n, such that the filter is free of limit cycles. For this, some existing criteria [40,41], which ensure the global asymptotic stability (thereby, imply the absence of any kind of instability including limit cycles), may be utilized. Pertaining to the system described by (1) and (2), the following result is reported in [41].Theorem 1(See[41].) Letsidenote the sum of absolute values of elements in the i-th row of system matrixA=[aij], i.e.,(6)si=∑j=1n|aij|,i=1,2,…,n,and(7a)si>1,i=1,2,…,m,(7b)si⩽1,i=m+1,m+2,…,n.Then the zero solution of the system described by(1),(2)and(7)is globally asymptotically stable if there exist a positive definite symmetric matrixP∈Rn×nand a positive definite diagonal matrixD=diag(d11,d22,…,dnn)satisfying(8a)[P+2KqKoATDBA−KqATD−KoATBD−KqDA−KoDBA2D−P]>0,where(8b)B=[Im000]∈Rn×n.Remark 1Theorem 1 is based on the assumption that the elements ofAsatisfy (7). Such assumption does not pose any real difficulty because of the fact that any system given by (1) and (2) can always be transformed into an equivalent system satisfying (7) by relabeling the states of the original system. The approach in [41] makes use of the parameterssi,i=1,2,…,n, but it does not utilize the values of the maximum normalized quantization error of the quantizer and the maximum representable number for a given wordlength.Remark 2As illustrated in [41], Theorem 1 may uncover some newA(i.e., not covered by [40, Theorem 1]) for which system (1) and (2) is globally asymptotically stable.Remark 3It may be mentioned that [38, Theorem 1], [40, Theorem 3] cannot be applied to the cases where‖A‖∞>1and [38, Theorem 3] is not applicable ifρ(|A|)>1where|A|=[|aij|]. However, as shown in [40,41] such cases may fall within the application scope of Theorem 1 and [40, Theorem 1].In this section, a new criterion for the global asymptotic stability of the system described by (1) and (2) is established.In the light of (4), system (1) can be represented as(9)x(r+1)=O{Ax(r)+e(r)}.System (9) can be interpreted as a nonlinear system driven by a bounded error signale(r).With a view to achieve an asymptotic bound on system (9), we now introduce a new nonlinear nonnegative system given by(10a)w(r+1)=S{|A|w(r)+δ1n},with the initial condition(10b)w(0)=Nmax1n,wherew(r)∈Rnis the state vector andS(ξ)=[S1(ξ1)S2(ξ2)⋯Sn(ξn)]Tis a saturation-type nonlinear function characterized by(11)Si(ξi)={Nmax,ξi>Nmax,ξi,0⩽ξi⩽Nmax,i=1,2,…,n.Since (10) represents a positive system, the nonlinearitiesSi(ξi),i=1,2,…,n, given by (11) are defined only forξi⩾0.The following lemma provides a connection between the state response of system (9) and that of (10).Lemma 1The state response of the system(9)is bounded by the state response of system(10), i.e.,(12)|x(r)|⩽w(r),∀r⩾0.ProofFrom (5) and (10b), it follows that(13)|x(0)|⩽w(0).Employing (4), (9) and (11), one obtains(14)|x(r+1)|=|O{Ax(r)+e(r)}|⩽S{|A||x(r)|+δ1n},∀r⩾0.Using (10), (13) and (14), one can easily arrive at the relation (12) by induction onr⩾0. This completes the proof of Lemma 1.  □It is clear from Lemma 1 that the asymptotic response of the system in (9) (which is an equivalent representation of system (1)) is bounded by the asymptotic response of system (10). In the following, by analyzing the dynamic behavior of the system (10), we establish an iterative algorithm for determining the composite nonlinearities of system (1) which will act only in quantization region. Initializing the variablesn0=0,J0=ϕandu0=Nmax1n, we will discuss the procedure fork∈Z+. Pertaining to system (10), in the first iterationk=1,J1denotes a set ofn1elements containing those i's for which(|A|u0+δ1n)i<NmaxandJ1cis a set ofn−n1elements containing those i's for which(|A|u0+δ1n)i⩾Nmax. The situationJ1=J0=ϕimplies thatwi(r)<Nmaxdoes not hold fori=1,2,…,n, in system (10a), which, in turn, indicates that the composite nonlinearitiesfi(yi(r)),i=1,2,…,n, associated with system (1) may enter into the overflow region. Therefore, we will stop the procedure ifJ1=J0and assignJF=J1.Next, consider the situation whereJ1≠J0. Pertaining to system (10), consider a linear subsystem(15)η(r+1)=|A|J1,J1cNmax1n−n1+|A|J1,J1η(r)+δ1n1.From [30, Proposition 2], it follows that|A|J1,J1is Schur stable. The equilibrium stateαof system (15) satisfies(16)α=|A|J1,J1cNmax1n−n1+|A|J1,J1α+δ1n1.Since|A|J1,J1is Schur stable, the matrix (In1−|A|J1,J1) is invertible. Therefore, (16) can be rewritten as(17)α=(In1−|A|J1,J1)−1(|A|J1,J1cNmax1n−n1+δ1n1).In the next iterationk=2, define the vectoru1as follows(18a)(u1)J1c=Nmax1n−n1,(18b)(u1)J1=(In1−|A|J1,J1)−1{|A|J1,J1cNmax1n−n1+δ1n1}.LetJ2denote a set of elements containing those i's for which(|A|u1+δ1n)i<Nmax. IfJ2=J1, the procedure is stopped andJF=J2is assigned, else on the same linesu2is defined and the setJ3is determined by calculating the i's for which(|A|u2+δ1n)i<Nmax.In the following, we provide an iterative algorithm based on the above discussion to identify the composite nonlinearities which effectively act as quantization nonlinearities only. In particular, the algorithm generates a set of coordinate indexesJFcorresponding to the composite nonlinearities operating in quantization region only.Remark 4An examination of Algorithm 1reveals thatJk⊇Jk−1,∀k∈Z+.Remark 5For alli∈JF, the relationwi(r)<Nmaxholds in system (10a). This implies that the composite nonlinearitiesfi(yi(r)),∀i∈JFinvolved in system (1), will operate only as quantization nonlinearities.The main result of the paper may be stated as follows.Theorem 2For a given system(1)and(2), let the setJFbe calculated using Algorithm1. Construct a diagonal matrixC=diag(c11,c22,…,cnn)where(19a)cii={0,ifi∈JF1,ifi∈JFc.Then the zero solution of the system described by(1)and(2)is globally asymptotically stable if there exist a positive definite symmetric matrixP∈Rn×nand a positive definite diagonal matrixD=diag(d11,d22,…,dnn)satisfying(19b)G=[P+2KqKoATDCA−KqATD−KoATCD−KqDA−KoDCA2D−P]>0.ProofIn view of Remark 5,fi(yi(r)),∀i∈JFare confined to the sector[0,Kq], i.e.,(20)fi(0)=0,0⩽fi(yi(r))yi(r)⩽Kqyi2(r),∀i∈JF.Now, choose a quadratic Lyapunov function(21)v(x(r))=xT(r)Px(r).Application of (21) to (1) provides(22)Δv(x(r))=v(x(r+1))−v(x(r))=fT(y(r))Pf(y(r))−xT(r)Px(r).Consider the quantity ‘β’ given by(23)β=∑i∈JFc2dii[Kqyi(r)−fi(yi(r))][fi(yi(r))−Koyi(r)]+∑i∈JF2dii[Kqyi(r)−fi(yi(r))][fi(yi(r))],wheredii>0,i=1,2,…,n. In view of (2) and (20), (23) is non-negative. Using (19a), (23) can be rearranged as(24)β=−2KqKoyT(r)DCy(r)+yT(r)(KqD+KoCD)f(y(r))+fT(y(r))(KqD+KoDC)y(r)−2fT(y(r))Df(y(r)).From (22) and (24), it follows that(25)Δv(x(r))=−[xT(r)fT(y(r))]G[x(r)f(y(r))]−β,which satisfies(26)Δv(x(r))⩽0,if (19b) holds true andΔv(x(r))=0only whenx(r)=0. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.  □Remark 6An alternative form of the condition given in (19b) is(27)μ=[P−Kq2ATPAKqAT(P−D)+KoATCDKq(P−D)A+KoDCA2D−P]>0,since (25) can also be expressed as(28)Δv(x(r))=−[xT(r)φT(y(r))]μ[x(r)φ(y(r))]−β,where(29)φ(y(r))=Kqy(r)−f(y(r)).Remark 7It may be mentioned that an algorithm analogous to Algorithm 1 is presented in [30] in the context of the stability analysis of digital filters with saturation arithmetic. Algorithm 1 may be treated as an extension of [30] from the case of discrete-time systems with saturation arithmetic to a class of systems operating under various combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities.Remark 8Theorem 2 makes use of the sector information of the composite nonlinearities in a precise manner and, therefore, it is not applicable for the digital filters with value truncation quantization. The value truncation quantization, owing to its peculiar characteristic, cannot be characterized using sector concept [18,38,40].Remark 9Note that, in the development of Algorithm 1 and in the proof of Theorem 2, nowhere it is required to impose the restriction similar to (7). Theorem 2 (in conjunction with Algorithm 1) can be directly used to test the global asymptotic stability of a digital filter with known δ andNmax. The condition expressed by (19b) is a linear matrix inequality (LMI) and, thus, is computationally tractable [42,43]. The matrixCgiven by (19a) is dependent onJFwhich can be obtained via Algorithm 1. Though the condition (19b) is apparently free of parameters δ andNmax, these parameters have been utilized in Algorithm 1 to obtainJF. Using Theorem 2, one can easily identify the combination(s) of overflow and quantization that would be required to guarantee the absence of zero-input limit cycles in a digital filter. Theorem 2 is less conservative than existing ones [38,40,41], and this fact will be illustrated in Section 4. It will also be demonstrated how Theorem 2 can be used to determine the minimum wordlength (if exists) for assuring the absence of limit cycles in a digital filter (see Example 2).It is worth comparing the main result of this paper (Theorem 2) with previously reported results [40,41]. Theorem 1 in [40] is based on exploiting the fact that all composite nonlinearities are confined to the sector[Ko,Kq]. On the other hand, depending on the values of system parameters (see (7)), the approach in [41] identifies that the composite nonlinearitiesfi(yi(r)),i=m+1,m+2,…,n, effectively act as only quantization nonlinearities and, therefore, such nonlinearities are viewed as confined to the sector[0,Kq], rather than being confined to the sector[Ko,Kq]. In particular, under assumption (7), the approach in [41] makes use of the following relation(30)∑i=1m2dii[Kqyi(r)−fi(yi(r))][fi(yi(r))−Koyi(r)]+∑i=m+1n2dii[Kqyi(r)−fi(yi(r))][fi(yi(r))]⩾0,wheredii>0,i=1,2,…,n, to arrive at (8). As discussed in [41], (30) turns out to be a more precise characterization of composite nonlinearities than the characterization used in the derivation of [40, Theorem 1]. It may be noticed that, unlike [40, Theorem 1], the result in [41] is based on assumption (7). However, as noted in Remark 1, such assumption does not pose any real difficulty in applications.With a view to provide a clear link between Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, let us now examine the presented approach carefully. Theorem 2 is based on a unique characterization of composite nonlinearities, namely,β⩾0(see (23)). Observe that, the setJFinvolved in the expression of β (see (23)) is obtained via an iterative algorithm (Algorithm 1). A unique feature of Algorithm 1 is that it exploits the information of the maximum normalized quantization error (δ) and the maximum representable number (Nmax). This feature is seemingly missing in the approaches of [40,41]. From Remark 5, it follows that the composite nonlinearitiesfi(yi(r)),∀i∈JFinvolved in system (1), will operate only in the quantization region. An examination of Algorithm 1 reveals that, as compared to the approach in [41], the present approach, in general, is capable of capturing a larger subset of composite nonlinearities that effectively operate as only quantization nonlinearities. In other words, the nonnegativity of β (see (23)) turns out to be a more precise characterization of the composite nonlinearities as compared to (30). This qualitatively explains why the present approach may lead to a less stringent stability condition than the previous approaches [40,41].Pertaining to system (1), we now identify the following two cases where the present approach yields same stability region as obtainable via [40, Theorem 1], [41].Case 1Ko=0.It is easy to observe that Theorem 2 becomes identical to Theorem 1 in this case. Further, as noted in [41], Theorem 1 reduces to [40, Theorem 1] forKo=0.Case 2∑j=1n|aij|>1,i=1,2,…,n.In this case, as shown in [41], Theorem 1 reduces to [40, Theorem 1]. Further, Algorithm 1 in the present approach providesJF=ϕ, and consequently,Cin Theorem 2 is identified asIn. Thus, Theorem 2 also reduces to [40, Theorem 1] in the light of Remark 6.Except the above two cases, Theorem 2 may lead to results not covered by [40, Theorem 1], [41]. Two examples illustrating the improvement realized from the present approach are in order.Example 1Consider a digital filter described by (1) and (2) with(31)A=[0.8−1.75−2.5−0.1−0.5−0.70.10.10.5],which is operating in the presence of magnitude truncation quantization (i.e.,δ=1) and two's complement overflow arithmetic. Clearly, the nonlinearities under consideration belong to the sector[Ko,Kq]=[−1,1].To test the global asymptotic stability of the system under consideration, let us first apply Theorem 1. From (6) and (7), one obtainss1=5.05>1,s2=1.3>1,s3=0.7<1andm=2for this example. Using the Matlab LMI toolbox [42,43], it is checked that there do not exist any positive definite symmetric matrixPand positive definite diagonal matrixDsatisfying (8). Thus, Theorem 1 fails as a global asymptotic stability test in this example. It can also be verified that [40, Theorem 1] fails to determine the global asymptotic stability for the present system.Observe that‖A‖∞=5.05>1andρ(|A|)=1.4561forAgiven by (31). Therefore, in view of Remark 3, the present example falls outside the application scope of [38, Theorems 1 and 3] and [40, Theorem 3].Assuming that the present system is to be implemented on a 16-bit digital processor, we now apply Theorem 2 to test the global asymptotic stability. TakingNmax=215andδ=1, in the first iteration (i.e.,k=1) of Algorithm 1, we haveu0=[215215215]T,|A|u0+δ13=[165479.442599.422938.6]T,J1={3},n1=1,(u1)J1=(1−0.5)−1{[0.10.1][215215]+1}=13109.2.Whenk=2, one can see that,u1=[327683276813109.2]T,|A|u1+δ13=[116332.428838.2413109.2]T,J2={2,3},n2=2,(u2)J2=([1001]−[0.50.70.10.5])−1([0.10.1][215]+[11])=[2185210926].Fork=3, we haveu2=[327682185210926]T,|A|u2+δ13=[91771.42185210926]T,J3={2,3}.Note thatJ3=J2. Thus, the procedure terminates withJF={2,3}. Now, from (19a), it follows that(32)C=[100000000].Using the Matlab LMI toolbox [42,43], it turns out that (19b) with (32) is feasible for the following values of unknown parameters:(33)P=[1.1809−0.4655−0.4043−0.465519.282611.3080−0.404311.308025.3459],D=[0.626600022.511700026.5478].Therefore, according to Theorem 2, the present system is globally asymptotically stable.Example 2Consider a digital filter represented by (1) and (2) with(34)A=[0.8−1.75−2.5−0.1−0.489−10.10.10.5],which operates under magnitude truncation quantization and two's complement overflow. Observe that, the nonlinearities involved in this system are confined to the sector[Ko,Kq]=[−1,1].ForAgiven by (34), we have‖A‖∞=5.05>1andρ(|A|)=1.4947. Therefore, [38, Theorems 1 and 3] and [40, Theorem 3] cannot be applied to ascertain the global asymptotic stability of this system (see Remark 3). Using the Matlab LMI toolbox [42,43], it is easy to verify that Theorem 1 and [40, Theorem 1] fail to affirm the global asymptotic stability in the present example.Now, we consider the following two cases to illustrate the effect of finite wordlength on the stability behavior of the system under consideration using the presented approach.Case AImplementation on an 8-bit processorPertaining to the realization of the present system using 8-bit processor, one hasNmax=27andδ=1. In the first iteration (i.e.,k=1) of Algorithm 1, we haveu0=[272727]T,|A|u0+δ13=[647.4204.39290.6]T,J1={3},n1=1,(u1)J1=(1−0.5)−1{[0.10.1][2727]+1}=53.2.Fork=2,u1=[12812853.2]T,|A|u1+δ13=[460.4129.59253.2]T,J2={3},n2=1.SinceJ2=J1, this procedure terminates withJF={3}. From (19a), we obtain(35)C=[100010000]It is checked that there do not exist any positive definite symmetric matrixPand positive definite diagonal matrixDsatisfying (19b) with (35). Thus, Theorem 2 fails as a global asymptotic stability test for the 8-bit realization of the present system.Case BImplementation on a 16-bit processorIf the present system is implemented with a 16-bit processor, thenNmax=215andδ=1. In this case, application of Algorithm 1 yieldsJF={2,3}. From (19a), one obtains(36)C=[100000000].By the Matlab LMI toolbox [42,43], it turns out that (19b) with (36) is feasible for(37)P=[2.9238−0.9410−0.3242−0.941044.451938.3465−0.324238.346576.4884],D=[1.513000059.490800083.8497].Thus, according to Theorem 2, the 16-bit realization of the present digital filter is globally asymptotically stable.In the above, we observe that Theorem 2 fails to assure the global asymptotic stability for 8-bit realization of the present system but succeeds to conclude the same for an increased wordlength (i.e., 16-bit realization). On the other hand, in the previous approaches [40,41], there is no way to know whether a given system may become globally asymptotically stable for an increased wordlength. The dependency ofNmaxon the stability of a given system (1) and δ makes the present approach quite interesting. Such dependence of δ andNmaxon the stability results in [40, Theorem 1], [41] is apparently missing.Next, we aim to determine the minimum wordlength that would be required to guarantee the absence of limit cycles using Theorem 2 for the example under consideration.Let the minimum wordlength required for the limit cycle-free realization of the present digital filter be(l+1)bits whereNmax=2l. Now, in the first iteration (i.e.,k=1) of Algorithm 1, one obtains(38)u0=[2l2l2l]T,|A|u0+δ13=[5.05×2l+11.589×2l+10.7×2l+1]T.Note that there does not exist any l satisfying(|A|u0+δ13)1=5.05×2l+1<2lor(|A|u0+δ13)2=1.589×2l+1<2l. However,(|A|u0+δ13)3=0.7×2l+1<2lforl⩾2. Now, if we selectl=2then it follows thatJ1={3},n1=1.For any l, a routine calculation shows that(u1)J1=(1−0.5)−1{[0.10.1][2l2l]+1}=0.4×2l+2,and, subsequently fork=2, one obtains(39)u1=[2l2l0.4×2l+2]T,|A|u1+δ13=[3.55×2l+60.989×2l+30.4×2l+2]T.From (39), it is clear thatJF=J2={3}forl=2, which yields(40)C=[100010000].WithCgiven by (40), it can be verified that (19b) is infeasible for the present example. In other words, while implementing the present system using (2+1) bits hardware, the present approach fails to ensure the global asymptotic stability.Next, consider the(l+1)-bit realization of the present system wherel>2. An examination of (39) reveals that(|A|u1+δ13)2<2lforl⩾9, but there does not exist any l satisfying(|A|u1+δ13)1<2l. Therefore, pertaining to the system under consideration, one obtains forl=9thatJ2={2,3},n2=2,(u2)J2=([1001]−[0.48910.10.5])−1{[0.10.1]2l+[11]}=[0.9645×2l+9.6450.3929×2l+3.929].Subsequently, whenk=3, one has(41)u2=[2l0.9645×2l+9.6450.3929×2l+3.929]T,|A|u2+δ13=[3.47×2l+27.7010.9645×2l+9.6450.3929×2l+3.929]T.Therefore,JF=J3={2,3},n3=2,forl=9, which implies(42)C=[100000000].WithCgiven by (42), it can be verified that (19b) is feasible for the present example. In other words, according to the present approach, the global asymptotic stability is guaranteed in this example if it is implemented on a processor having at least (9+1) bits wordlength.Summarizing the above, the presented approach has a distinct advantage over the previous approaches [38,40,41] in that Theorem 2 can yield stability conditions which are outside the scope of [38,40,41]. In other words, in the design of digital filters employing quantization and overflow nonlinearities, Theorem 2 could help to obtain a larger stability region than that obtainable via the criteria in [38,40,41], which is important since, for efficient design, it is required to have as large stability region as possible. It is also shown how Theorem 2 can be used to determine the minimum wordlength (if exists) for guaranteeing the absence of limit cycles in a digital filter.
