@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Downloading software via Web is a major solution for publishers to deliver their software products. In this context, user interfaces for software downloading play a key role. Actually, they have to allow usable interactions as well as support users in taking conscious and coherent decisions about whether to accept to download a software product or not. This paper presents different design alternatives for software download interfaces, i.e. the interface that prompts the user if he wishes to actually complete its download, and evaluates their ability to improve the quality of user interactions while reducing errors in user decisions. More precisely, we compare Authenticode, the leading software download interface for Internet Explorer, to Question-&-Answer, a software download interface previously proposed by the authors Dini, Foglia, Prete, & Zanda (2007). Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of extending both interfaces by means of a reputation system similar to the eBay Feedback Forum. The results of the usability studies show that (i) the pure Question-&-Answer interface is the most effective in minimizing users incoherent behaviors, and (ii) the differences in reputation rankings significantly influence users. Overall results suggest guidelines to design the best interface depending on the context (brand reputation and product features).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
User interfaces for software download on the Internet are the front end of online software publishers for remote users. One important component of such interfaces is the software download interface, namely the interface that prompts the user if he wishes to actually complete its download, after that he/she has browsed on a web site and selected the desired product to download. The design of such an interface is critical, because it usually shows product related information that should guide the user in its final choice. Software download interfaces are critical for users who may take unconscious or misguided decisions if the interfaces have not been properly designed (Allen, Currie, Bakken, Patel, & Cimino, 2006; Maxion & Reeder, 2005). Software download interfaces are critical for publishers too, if the interfaces reduce user trust and satisfaction and system usability at large (Flavian, Guinaliu, & Gurrea, 2006; Hoffman, Blum, & Lawson-Jenkins, 2006; Shin, 2010). Finally, software downloading has security implications too. Brustoloni & Villamarin-Salomon have shown that a poorly designed software download interface may cause unjustified risks in terms of breaches in a per-user derived policy adopted to classify risks (Brustoloni & Villamarin-Salomon, 2007).The Security Warning Dialog Box in the Microsoft Authenticode interface is a reference, largely-used software download interface for Internet Explorer. Prior works have highlighted weaknesses of such an interface (Dini, Foglia, Prete, & Zanda, 2006; Cranor, 2007), as well as the attitude of the users to seldom act appropriately when presented with such a download interface (Wood2010). In particular, in line with Brustoloni and Villamarin-Salomon (2007), incoherent behaviors in users interacting with the Microsoft Authenticode interface were observed in Dini et al. (2006), where an incoherent behavior consists in a download decision that is incoherent with the motivation given a posteriori. According to Shin (2010), the rate of online visitors who buy a product or download software is influenced, among other factors, by trust and attitude, with trust also depending on user interface design quality (Flavian et al., 2006; Hoffman et al., 2006). As a consequence, software download interfaces should have a good design that minimizes incoherent behaviors, increases user trust and, then, supports the user intention to purchase.In prior works we have proposed a Question-&-Answer (Q&A) interface, i.e. a software download interface aimed at reducing incoherent behaviors by asking the user questions about specific product download issues, e.g., the product cost (Dini et al., 2007). Furthermore, we have suggested the use of a Reputation System(RS)–a service like the eBay Feedback Forum–to increase the user trust on a given software product (Dini, Foglia, Prete, & Zanda, 2013).In this paper we experimentally compare the Authenticode and Q&A software download interfaces and evaluate the effects of their extension by means of a reputation system. The overall result is that any solution that increases users attention to the interface contents also significantly reduces incoherent behaviors. Nonetheless, the three design choices are not equivalent as they make users focus on different aspects of the proposed products. For example, RS make users to focus on the aggregated social feedback from previous users whereas Q&A makes users to focus on specific software download issue, such as the cost. Even if the minimization of incoherent behaviors through a Q&A-enhanced interface has positive effects on users trust, it causes a strong reduction in all software downloads because users tend only to accept free software, refusing software that entails a charge. So, if having a large market penetration is needed, publishers should not adopt a Q&A interface if the software offered entails a charge. However, embedding a reputation mechanism side by side to a Q&A dialog reduces the relevance of cost, and reduces incoherent behaviors at an intermediate level. Showing aggregated feedback from previous users has a mitigating role between the common interface and the Q&A interface. From these findings we indicate how designers can better tackle the design tradeoffs in these user interfaces.The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the background of the problem, and shows how the macro-hypotheses under test have been developed. Sections 3 and 4 show the graphical interfaces that have been tested in the experiments and present the experimental settings. Then, the experimental results are given with a concluding discussion on the observed trends.Online software delivery, like common e-commerce, must solve concerns especially regarding authentication and trust, in order to make users confident that they are not being cheated (CommerceNet., 2000; Corritore, Kracher, & Wiedenbeck, 2003). Complex Web interfaces and fraudulent software houses have caused serious problems such as spreading dialers, spywares and other threats (Shukla & Nah, 2005).In this environment users cannot relate with a merchant and understand whether the software is in line with their expectations. In an ordinary shop, clients relate with a merchant and establish a trust relationship, and a similar relationship should be established also online (Corritore et al., 2003; Cheskin research, 1999). Easy-to-use interfaces and complete information are highly correlated to user trust (Flavian et al., 2006; Hoffman et al., 2006; Nilsson, Adams, & Herd, 2005; Laberge & Caird, 2000; Lanford, 2006), and a trustworthy interface is more likely to make users trust a vendor on the Internet (Fogg et al., 2001).A trustworthy, usable interface would not solve two relevant questions for users dealing with software download from the Internet: first, the need to know who really published the file offered, second, supporting the user in understanding what to expect from the executable file. As a solution to the first problem (authentication), major software vendors have developed frameworks for code signing (Jansen, 2000; Thawte., 2007), such as the Microsoft Authenticode that has been taken as reference in the current study due to its widespread diffusion on the Internet: 53% of the market share (BMS, 2012). By signing code, publishers seek to build a relationship of trust with users, satisfying the matter of accountability at the same time. Software publishers sign the piece of software they are releasing. The publisher’s certificate, the certification authority certificate, and the signed code are then packaged together.At the client side, the browser verifies the publisher’s signature on the code, and, if verifications are successful, the Security Warning dialog box (SWDB) is presented to the user (Fig. 1). If some problems arise, the user is notified with a different dialog box. The SWDB presents the certification authority name, the software publisher name and the software name, as well as other details such as the cost and other optional information pieces. This information is shared by means of the different Authenticode versions that have been released over the years.The further issue to be faced in software downloading concerns the user’s expectations of the file. The Authenticode framework, like other code signing frameworks, ties a publisher to a file via its certification authority, but it does not help the user understand what to expect from the file. Predictability in this scenario would be important as it influences trust (Corritore et al., 2003). Current software download frameworks do not give any safe information about what and how the executable file will behave once run on a computer system. Given that predictability cannot be fully ensured with the above approaches, in recent years Reputation Systems (RS) have emerged as a method for fostering trust among strangers cooperating online by gathering, distributing, and aggregating the feedback of previous consumers (Resnick, Kuwabara, Zeckhauser, & Friedman, 2000).Deciding whether to accept or refuse a software download is a context-dependent decision: “In such a situation, an application usually needs user input, because the application cannot determine automatically all the context relevant to the decision” (Brustoloni & Villamarin-Salomon, 2007). For instance, receiving a software should be allowed if the sender is a friend, and should be denied if the sender is a malicious user. Based on Brustoloni and Villamarin-Salomon (2007) classification of interaction paradigms that support such decisions, in this paper we analyze the warn-and-continue and the context sensitive guidance. A context sensitive guidance interface asks the user to provide context information necessary for a security decision, while in the warn-and-continue approach the application warns the user of the risk and asks whether the user wants to accept it or not. Interfaces for software download (e.g.: the Authenticode Security Warning Dialog Box) follow the warn-and-continue approach.In Dini et al. (2006) users claimed that they wished to download free software only, but they largely accepted software from Well-Known (WK) publishers, showing that the brand effect was more important than cost. Thus, users did not focus their attention on the whole interface, but they accepted or refused software downloads according to the publisher name, not the item cost. In addition, the Authenticode Security Warning Dialog Box prevented Common Name (CN) publishers with little or null brand name from having their software downloaded. Similar considerations were done by Brustoloni and Villamarin-Salomon (2007) and , Wood2010 highlighting the problems deriving from the warn-and-continue approach: users click “continue” automatically, click through warnings due to habit (Chia, Heiner, & Asokan, 2010), do not pay attention to the whole information in the interface, and run into incoherent behaviors (Dini et al., 2007) or unjustified risks (breaches in the policy adopted to classify risks) (Brustoloni & Villamarin-Salomon, 2007). As a countermeasure to these problems, (Brustoloni and Villamarin-Salomon2007) propose the adoption of polymorphic dialogs that change the form of the required user inputs, forcing users to pay attention to security decisions. While Dini et al. (2007) tested a Question-&-Answer (Q&A) interface designed to increase user attention on the contents of the interface. Both the designs proved effective in reducing unjustified risks or incoherent behaviors compared to other interaction paradigms.Trust for Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman (1995) is the willingness of a trustor to be vulnerable to the actions of a trustee based on the expectation that the trustee will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control the trustee. Trust is driven by many variables, and upon deciding whether to accept or refuse a software download, the user should be able to predict if the software meets with his/her expectations. Predictability influences trust: “predictability is a trustor’s expectation that an object of trust will act consistently based on past experience” (Corritore et al., 2003). To better understand and solve trust issues, Egger (2000) proposed a model of trust for electronic commerce, which includes interface properties such as usability and familiarity, and cooperation between consumers. Cooperation is relevant also for Olson & Olson (2000), who states that trust deals with behavior: “people learn to trust others by noting their behavior”. In the online domain, the end user has limited possibilities to fully try a software product or a service before buying, while the software publisher knows what he gets as long as he receives money. “The inefficiencies resulting from this information asymmetry can be mitigated through trust and reputation” (Josang, Ismail, & Boyd, 2007). Reputation Systems help end users in predicting whether a product can be trusted or not. Enforcing a trust belief in the end users towards a remote software provider is a subjective phenomenon influenced by a set of factors, and in absence of personal experience, trust must be based on third party reviews. For Josang et al. (2007), reputation is a collective measure of trustworthiness based on reviews from members in a community.Lin, Rong, & Thatcher (2009) validate a research model wherein purchase intention and swift trust are influenced by a set of parameters, including perceived social presence, awareness of 3rd party assurance, and perceived security (Fig. 2). Swift trust refers to trust formed quickly in new or transitory relationships (Meyerson et al., 1996). According to Lin, “social presence refers to consumers’ perception that there is personal, sociable, and sensitive human contact and/or peer community on the Web site”. This type of reassurance for online entities is similar to the reassurance provided by brick and mortar businesses (Gefen & Straub, 2004). The model by Lin et al. infers users opinions and intentions by looking at the answers from a survey. The users answers are analyzed to derive how “Purchase intention” is influenced by a set of factors. The problem with survey-only studies is that relevant aspects of the user interaction are not differentiated qualitatively. In an everyday Internet scenario users can make incoherent decisions, which happen to differ significantly from the desired behaviors. For instance, it is clear that asking a user “Do you feel safe to provide your login and password to a phishing Website?” will cause a negative answer. Though in real life the user could behave differently because of badly designed interactions, fraudulent designs, lack of attention.The results of this paper help to understand how interfaces can be better designed to meet the users needs, in a safe way. Thus, our study is orthogonal to the above research model: we investigate what happens in some building blocks of the above model, when real interfaces must be designed. The block “Social presence” suggests the adoption of a Reputation System as aggregator of reputation scores from a community, also to improve the efficiency in the process of software downloading. Resnick et al. (2000) state that these mechanisms can help people make decisions about who to trust and provide incentive for honest behavior, while deterring dishonest parties from participating. Despite many problems in theory (Resnick et al., 2000), in practice RSs proved to work rather well as a means to provide relevant information on the quality of merchants and products in auction sites. Successful examples are represented by iTunes and its reputation system for both desktop and mobile users, by the eBay auction site, or online book sellers like Amazon (Chia et al., 2010; Dellarocas C., 2003; Chen and Liu, 2011). RSs have been proposed as a means to identify inauthentic content in file sharing applications (Walsh & Sirer, 2006), and similarly they could be effective in helping users to identify deceptive software publishers.The model by Lin also includes “Perceived security” which, as shown in Section 2.1, can be managed by designing a context sensitive interface like the Q&A. The Q&A proved effective in minimizing incoherent decisions, thus increasing perceived security in the interaction paradigm, as also observed in questionnaire answers (Dini et al., 2007). In our design, the Q&A interface asks for an explicit feedback on cost, and this results in minimizing the incoherent behaviors, but also in focusing users attention on cost.The Reputation System makes users focus on aggregated scores from previous users, and by doing so it also increases users overall attention in the interface. With the RS, the answer given in the Q&A interface becomes one of the possible driving factors together with the scores shown in the RS box. This is tested with the hypothesis H1:H1The RS reduces the relevance of cost aspects when compared to the Q&A interface.The RS does not ask for an explicit feedback in order to let the user go further with the download, so it should be expected an increase in incoherent behaviors when compared with a Q&A interaction (hypothesis H2).H2The Q&A interface minimizes incoherent behaviors when compared to the other interfaces.From these considerations, combining the Q&A with the RS should increase incoherent behaviors when compared to plain Q&A (hypothesis H3), and reduce them when compared with the common Authenticode interface (hypothesis H4).H3The RS with Q&A increases incoherent behaviors when compared to the Q&A.The RS with Q&A reduces incoherent behaviors when compared to the SWDB.And we also test H5, H6 and H7:H5The RS with Q&A reduces the relevance of cost aspects when compared to the Q&A interface.The RS with Q&A increases the relevance of trust when compared to the Q&A interface.The RS with Q&A increases the relevance of trust when compared to the SWDB interface.The Question-&-Answer interface (Q&A) (Dini et al., 2007) utilized in our study is a wizard with three steps. The first step replicates the information of the common SWDB, while the second step asks the cost of the software under download, and the third steps allows to download the software if the given answer is correct (Fig. 3). The reason why we choose to focus on the cost information is the following. In a previous work (Dini et al., 2007) we found incoherent behaviors of users with respect to cost, namely users stated they wanted to download free software whereas in practice they actually downloaded expensive one (or vice versa). We also proved that the Q&A interface mitigates such a behavior. Therefore, in this work, we decided to start from such consolidated results. Conceptually, the Q&A interface may present questions on any other information that is considered relevant, such as name of the producers, name of the software, et cetera.Fig. 4shows the other interfaces used in our experiment. They are, respectively, the Security Warning Dialog Box (left) and the Q&A interface (right), both augmented by a reputation systems which display the aggregation of users rankings regarding the software to be downloaded (Dini et al., 2013). As shown in Fig. 4, the RS is placed at the bottom of the dialog box, showing the total number of feedback reviews, as well as the rate of positive, neutral, and negative reviews. According to the classification of RS ranking aggregation mechanisms proposed by Josang et al. (2007), the interface, like that of the eBay Feedback Forum, is a simple summation system. In a simple summation RS, the system accumulates all given ratings to get the overall reputation. The RS is simple and readable at a glance, providing a concise view of the distribution of users’ feedback (Dini et al., 2013). The implementation aspects of the RS are out the scope of this work. Anyway, the RS can be realized folling the approaches proposed in Josang et al. (2007), by utilizing object oriented technology (Bechini, Foglia, & Prete, 2002) in CMP systems (Foglia & Solinas, 2014).
