@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Estimation of the genome copy number variations (CNVs) measured using the high-resolution array-comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH) microarray is commonly provided in the presence of large Gaussian noise having white properties with different segmental variances. Medical experts must thus be highly concerned about the confidence limits for CNVs in order to make correct decisions about genomic changes. We carry out a probabilistic analysis of CNVs in HR-CGH microarray measurements and show that jitter in the breakpoints can be approximated with the discrete skew Laplace distribution. Using this distribution, we find the confidence upper and lower boundaries to guarantee an existence of genomic changes in the confidence interval of 99.73%. We suggest combining these boundaries with the estimates to give medical experts more information about actual CNVs. Experimental verification of the theory is provided by simulation and using real HR-CGH microarray-based measurements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A disease such as cancer is often accompanied with structural changes called copy-number variations (CNVs) in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of a genome essential for human life. The cell with the DNA typically has a number of copies of one or more sections of the DNA that results in the structural chromosomal rearrangements – deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations of certain parts [1–3]. Small such CNVs are present in many forms in the human genome, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertion–deletion polymorphisms, variable numbers of repetitive sequences, and genomic structural alterations [4]. If genomic aberrations involve large CNVs, the process was shown to be directly coupled with cancer and the relevant structural changes were called copy-number alterations (CNAs) [5]. A brief survey of types of chromosome alterations involving copy number changes is given in [6]. The copy number represents the number of DNA molecules in a cell and can be defined as the number of times a given segment of DNA is present in a cell. Because the DNA is usually double-stranded, the size of a gene or chromosome is often measured in base pairs. A commonly accepted unit of measurement in molecular biology is kilobase (kb) equal to 1000 base pairs of DNA [7]. The human genome with 23 chromosomes is estimated to be about 3.2 billion base pairs long and to contain 20,000–25,000 distinct genes [8]. Each CNV may range from about 1kb to several megabases (Mbs) in size [1].The array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is one of the most modern techniques employing chromosomal microarray analysis to detect the CNVs at a resolution level of 5–10kbs [9]. It was reported in [10] that the high-resolution CGH (HR-CGH) arrays are accurate to detect structural variations (SV) at resolution of 200bp. In microarray technique, the CNVs are often normalized and plotted as log2R/G=log2Ratio, where R and G are the fluorescent Red and Green intensities, respectively [11]. An annoying feature of such measurements is that the ratio is highly contaminated by noise of which intensity does not always allow for correct visual identification of the breakpoints and copy numbers and makes most of the estimation techniques poor efficient if the number of probes per CNV segment is small. Deletions as small as 300bp should also be detected in some cases. For instance, arrays with a 9-bp tiling path were used in [10] to map a 622-bp heterozygous deletion. The referenced studies did not utilize genome wide platform and the high resolution reported is limited to targeted studies, using custom platform. So, further progress in ultra-high probe resolution is desirable as shown, for example, in [12].Based on the physical nature of genome changes in human cells [1], the following distinct properties of the CNVs function were recognized [6]. It is piecewise-constant (PWC) and sparse with a small number of alterations on a long base-pair length. Its constant values are integer, although this property is not survived in the log2Ratio. Moreover, the constant value may not be integer for somatic alterations, such as seen in cancer, where a mixture of normal and affected cells might coexist. The measurement noise in the log2 Ratio is highly intensive and can be modeled as additive white Gaussian.A typical picture of the HR-CGH array measurement of the copy numbers generated with 8000 probes having resolution of 620bp and obeying the above-listed properties is sketched in Fig. 1. One recognizes here the breakpoints (edges) and segments with constant copy numbers. Typically, a chromosome section is observed with some average resolutionr¯, bp and M probes in the genomic location scale. The copy numbers change at L breakpoints,0<i1<⋯<iL<r¯M, which can be united in a vector(1)I=[i1i2…iL]T∈RL,where il, l∈[1, L], is the lth breakpoint location.To facilitate the algorithm design, the genomic location scale is often represented in the number of probes n∈[1, M] ignoring “bad” or empty measurements. In such a scale, the nlth discrete point corresponds to the ilth breakpoint in the genomic location scale. The points placed as 0<n1<⋯<nL<M can also be united in a vectorN=[n1n2…nL]T∈RL.AlthoughNfacilitates the algorithm design, the final estimate is typically represented in the genomic location scale as in Fig. 1.For L breakpoints, there are L+1 segmental changes aj, j∈[1, L+1], which can be united in a vector(2)a=[a1a2…aL+1]T∈RL+1,where ajcharacterizes a segment between ij−1 and ijon an interval [ij−1, ij−1].The CNVs estimation problem is thus to predict the breakpoints locationsIˆand the segmental changesaˆwith a maximum possible accuracy and precision acceptable for medical applications. Those who are familiar with the estimation theory can instantly characterize each of the specific regions numbered in Fig. 1. The relevant components of bothIand a can easily be estimated in the case (1), because the number of probes is large in each neighboring segment and the edges are sharp. In the case (2), the component ofIis well detectable, but the estimate of the relevant component of a may be imprecise owing to a small number of probes. Reasoning similarly, one may conclude that it is hard to estimate the components ofIand a in the case of (3). Finally, the cases (4) and (5) suggest that the segmental estimates may have enough precision, whereas the estimates of the edges not. An analysis of the estimation errors caused by the segmental noise and jitter in the breakpoints is thus required.Let us consider the microarray-based measurement of the CNVs in more detail. Fig. 2gives several simulated examples around the lth breakpoint with different realizations of the measurement white Gaussian noise having for simplicity equal segmental variances. The threshold (dashed) is placed equidistantly between the segmental changes. The breakpoint location is found by the maximum likelihood (ML). The case (a) is ideal to mean that with such locations of the measured points the ML estimate will be jitter-free. If it happens that some left-neighboring to ilpoints lie below the threshold (dashed), then the ML estimate will be found to the left of il; four points to the left in the case (b). We call it the left jitter. If some right-neighboring points lie as in Fig. 2c, then the ML estimate will be found to the right of il; two points to the right in the case (c). We call it the right jitter. Also, there may be observed some ambiguities as in the case (d) when the estimator gives two or more possible locations for the same breakpoint.During decades, many estimation approaches have been developed for PWC signals such as those generated by the chromosomal changes: wavelet-based [13,14], robust[14], adaptive kernel smoothers[15], ML based on Gauss's ordinary least squares (OLS), penalized bridge estimator [16] and ridge regression [17] (also known as Tikhonov regularization), fussed least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) [18], the Schwarz information criterion-based estimator [19,20], and forward-backward smoothers[21–23]. Some of these methods were adopted and developed in bioinformatics for the conditions of PWC chromosomal changes. Efficient algorithms for filtering, smoothing and detection were proposed in [24,25,13,14,26,20]. Methods for segmentation and modeling were developed in [27–29,19,30,31,24]. Sparse representation based on penalized optimization and Bayesian learning was provided in [32–35].A conclusion one may arrive at by applying different estimation techniques to Figs. 1 and 2 can be the following. In view of large segmental noise, no one estimator is able to provide jitter-free breakpoints detection and error-free segmental estimation. The estimation errors may be large and even unacceptable. Medical experts should thus be highly concerned about the confidence limits within which the true CNVs exist with high probability.In this paper, we provide a probabilistic analysis of CNVs in HR-CGH microarray measurements. We derive an approximate jitter distribution, employ the segmental Gaussian distribution, and find the confidence upper boundary (UB) and lower boundary (LB) in order to outline the confidence interval for genome changes in the three-sigma sense or with the probability of 99.73%. We suggest using these limits along with the estimates in order for medical experts to make more correct decisions about real structural changes in the DNA. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses jitter in the breakpoints along with the approximate jitter distribution. Section 3 presents the confidence limits. The results of this study are discussed in Section 4. Finally, concluding remarks can be found in Section 5.Pursuing the aim of determining the confidence limits for CNVs measured using HR-CGH array, we first derive the approximate jitter distribution for segmental Gaussian distribution. We then show that this approximation is the discrete skew Laplace distribution and verify it by simulation using multiple Monte Carlo runs.Consider a typical HR-CGH array measurement of two neighboring CNVs segments in white Gaussian noise with different segmental variances as shown in Fig. 3. A constant signal changes from level alto level al+1 around the breakpoint il. In the presence of noise, the location of ilis not clear owing to commonly large segmental variancesσl2andσl+12. As an example, the segmental Gaussian noise probability density functions (pdfs) pl(x) and pl+1(x) are shown in Fig. 3 forσl2>σl+12. Let us notice that pl(x) and pl+1(y) cross each other in two points, αland βl, providedσl2≠σl+12.Now consider N probes in each segment neighboring to ilwith average resolutionr¯. We thus may assign an event Aljmeaning that measurement at point il−N⩽j<ilbelongs to the lth segment. Another event Bljmeans that measurement at il⩽j<il+N−1 belongs to the (l+1)th segment. In our approach, we think that a measured value belongs to one segment if the probability is larger than if it belongs to another segment. For example, any measurement point in the interval between αland βl(Fig. 3) is supposed to belong to the (l+1)th segment.Following Fig. 3 and assuming different noise variancesσl2andσl+12, the events Aljand Bljcan be specified as follows [36]:(3)Aljil−Nl⩽j<ilis(αl<xj)∨(xj<βl),σl2>σl+12,xj>αl,σl2=σl+12,αl<xj<βl,σl2<σl+12,(4)Bljil⩽j<il+Nl−1isβl<xj<αl,σl2<σl+12,xj<αl,σl2=σl+12,(xj<αl)∨(xj>βl),σl2>σl+12.Because each point can belong only to one segment, the inverse events areA¯lj=1−AljandB¯lj=1−Blj.Events Aljand Bljcan be united into two blocksAl={Al(il−N)Al(il−N+1)…Al(il−1)},Bl={Bl(il)Bl(il+1)…Bl(il+N−1)}.If Aland Bloccur simultaneously with unit probability each, then jitter at ilwill never occur. However, there may be found some other events which do not obligatorily lead to jitter. For example, the first point in Fig. 2a lies below the threshold (dashed) but does not lead to jitter. We ignore such events and define approximately the probability P(AlBl) of the jitter-free breakpoint as(5)P(AlBl)=P(Ail−N…Ail−1Bil…Bil+N−1).The inverse eventP¯(AlBl)=1−P(AlBl)can thus be called the approximate jitter probability.In white Gaussian noise, all the events are independent and (5) can be rewritten as(6)P(AlBl)=PN(Al)PN(Bl),where following (3) and (4), the probabilities P(Al) and P(Bl) can be specified as, respectively,(7)P(Al)=1−∫βlαlpl(x)dx,σl2>σl+12,∫αl∞pl(x)dx,σl2=σl+12,∫αlβlpl(x)dx,σl2<σl+12,(8)P(Bl)=∫βlαlpl+1(x)dx,σl2>σl+12,∫−∞αlpl+1(x)dx,σl2=σl+12,1−∫αlβlpl+1(x)dx,σl2<σl+12,wherepl(x)=1/2πσl2e−((x−al)2)/σl2is Gaussian density.Let us now think that jitter occurs at some point il±k, 0⩽k⩽N, as shown for example in Fig. 2 and assign two additional blocks of eventsAlk={Ail−N…Ail−1−k}andBlk={Bil+k…Bil+N−1}. The probabilityPk−≜Pk−(AlkA¯l(il−k)…A¯il−1Bl)that jitter occurs at the kth point to the left from il(left jitter) and the probabilityPk+≜Pk+(AlB¯l(il+1)…B¯l(il+k−1)Bk)that jitter occurs at the kth point to the right from il(right jitter) can thus be written as, respectively,(9)Pk−=PN−k(Al)[1−P(Al)]kPN(Bl),(10)Pk+=PN(Al)[1−P(Bl)]kPN−k(Bl).By normalizing (9) and (10) with (6), we arrive at a function that turns out to be independent on N:(11)fl(k)=[P−1(Al)−1]|k|,k<0,(left)1k=0,[P−1(Bl)−1]k,k>0.(right)Further normalization of fl(k) to have a unit area leads to the pdfpl(k)=1ϕlfl(k), where ϕlis the sum of fl(k) for all k,(12)ϕl=1+∑k=1∞[φlA(k)+φlB(k)],whereφlA(k)=[P−1(Al)−1]kandφlB(k)=[P−1(Bl)−1]k.It follows from the approximation admitted that fl(k) converges with k only if0.5<P˜={P(A),P(B)}<1. Otherwise, ifP˜<0.5, the sum ϕlis infinite and fl(k) cannot be transformed to pl(k). It has been shown in [37] that such a situation is practically rare. It can be observed with extremely small and different segmental SNRs when the probabilities are comparable that the measurement point belongs to one of another segment.Accepting0.5<P˜={P(A),P(B)}<1, we conclude thatlnP˜<0,ln(1−P˜)<0, andln(1−P˜)<lnP˜. Next, using a standard relation∑k=1∞xk=1/(x−1−1), where x<1, and after little transformations we bring (12) to(13)ϕl=P(Al)+P(Bl)−1[1−2P(Al)][1−2P(Bl)].The jitter pdf pl(k) associated with the lth breakpoint can finally be found to be(14)pl(k)=1ϕl[P−1(Al)−1]|k|,k<0,1,k=0,[P−1(Bl)−1]k,k>0,where ϕlis specified by (13) and 0.5<P(Al), P(Bl)<1.If we now substitute ql=P−1(Al)−1 and dl=P−1(Bl)−1, find P(Al)=1/(1+ql) and P(Bl)=1/(1+dl), and provide the transformations, we arrive at a conclusion that (14) is the discrete skew Laplace pdf recently derived in [38]:(15)p(k|dl,ql)=(1−dl)(1−ql)1−dlqldlk,k⩾0,ql|k|,k⩽0,where dl=e−(κl/νl)∈(0, 1) and ql=e−(1/κlνl)∈(0, 1) and in which κland νl>0 still need to be connected to (14). In doing so, below we consider (14) and (15) at k=−1, k=0, and k=1. By equating (14) and (15), we first obtain ((1−dl)(1−ql)dl)/(1−dlql)=1/ϕl(1−P(Bl))/P(Bl) for k=1 and ((1−dl)(1−ql)ql)/(1−dlql)=1/ϕl(1−P(Al))/P(Al) for k=−1 that gives us(16)νl=1−κl2κllnμl,where μl=(P(Al)[1−P(Bl)])/(P(Bl)[1−P(Al)]). For k=0, we have ((1−dl)(1−ql))/(1−dlql)=1/ϕland transform it to the equationxl2−(ϕl(1+μl))/(1+ϕl)x−(1−ϕl)/(1+ϕl)μl=0, where proper solution is(17)xl=ϕl(1+μl)2(1+ϕl)1−1+4μl(1−ϕl2)ϕl2(1+μl)2and whichxl=μl−(κl2)/(1−κl2)gives us(18)κl=lnxlln(xl/μl).By combining (16) with (18), we also get a simpler form for νl, namely νl=−κl/lnxl.We now introduce the segmental signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)γl−=Δl2σl2,γl+=Δl2σl+12,where Δl=al+1−al, substitute the Gaussian pdf to (7) and (8), provide the transformations, and rewrite (7) and (8) as(19)P(Al)=1+12[erf(glβ)−erf(glα)],γl−<γl+,12erfc(g1α),γl−=γl+,12[erf(glβ)−erf(glα)],γl−>γl+,(20)P(Bl)=12[erf(hlα)−erf(hlβ)],γl−<γl+,1−12erfc(hlα),γl−=γl+,1+12[erf(hlα)−erf(hlβ)],γl−>γl+,whereglβ=(βl−Δl)/|Δl|γl−/2,glα=(αl−Δl)/|Δl|γl−/2,hlβ=βl/|Δl|γl+/2,hlα=αl/|Δl|γl+/2, erf(x) is the error function, erfc(x) is the complementary error function, and(21)αl,βl=alγl−−al+1γl+γl−−γl+∓1γl−−γl+×(al−al+1)γl−γl++2Δl2(γl−−γl+)lnγl−γl+ifγl−≠γl+. Forγl−=γl+, set αl=Δl/2 and βl=±∞.The discrete skew Laplace pdf (15) computed using (19) and (20) is shown in Fig. 4forγl−=2.78andγl+=6.25. It is seen that jitter may occur here at 7 points (five to the left and two to the right from k=0) if to allow the jitter probability of 1%. With smaller SNR values, the jitter increases.To find out how the skew Laplace distribution fits real measurements, we have generated a PWC signal (Fig. 3) of 200 points with the breakpoint at 101 and with known al=1 and al+1=0. The SNRs were set the same as in Fig. 4. We then used a ML estimator [23], found the breakpoint locations over 104 runs, plotted a histogram, normalized it to have a unit area, and arrived at a jitter pdf. To avoid ripples, we further repeated this procedure 9 times and averaged the results. The final jitter pdf circled in Fig. 4 has revealed some discrepancy with the Laplace distribution. We explain it by some probabilities ignored in the derivation of (14). The maximum approximation error of about 4% is seen here only at k=0. The error diminishes with k that however cannot be seen in logarithmic measures in Fig. 4. Note that (15) also fits the experimental histograms reported for some CNVs breakpoints in [27]. We thus come up with a conclusion that the discrete skew Laplace distribution is a good approximation for jitter in the breakpoints of CNVs, although further investigations may be necessary in order to find a more correct law.Because a step is unity with integer k, the jitter probabilityPk(γl−,γl+)can be specified at the kth point utilizing (15) as(22)Pk(γl−,γl+)=p[k|d(γl−,γl+),q(γl−,γl+)].The jitter probability (22) is determined for the breakpoint at zero assuming k≷0. To move (22) to il>0, one can substitute k with k−iland change k as k≷il. Fig. 5sketches Pk(γ) for small and large equal SNRsγ=γl−=γl+affected by somatic alterations. Here, we also show the probability of a jitter-free breakpoint (dashed) along with some values obtained by simulation in the SNR region most typical for the HR-CGH array measurements. As can be seen, (15) fits well the simulated data and we may continue on with some analysis.When structural changes are present in such a small fraction of the tested cells (i.e. somatic CNVs in cancer) that segmental SNRs are extremely small, the total jitter probabilityPJ(γl−,γl+)=P¯(AlBl)becomes almost unity, whereas the probability of the jitter-free breakpoint becomes almost zero. More precisely, the probability of the jitter-free breakpoint and the jitter probability at kth point tend toward 1/2N (see that the curves merge atγl−=γl+=10−2in Fig. 5). We watch for all these tendencies in Fig. 5.With an increase in structural changes, the segmental SNRs also increase, and the probability of the jitter-free breakpoint (dashed in Fig. 5) naturally becomes larger and finally reaches unity whenγl−→∞andγl+→∞. It is seen in Fig. 5 thatγl−=γl+=40makes the breakpoint jitter-free in the three-sigma sense. With an increase in the SNRs from zero, the jitter probability initially increases. It then reaches a maximum and thereafter decreases, when the SNRs become relatively large. It also follows from Fig. 5 that the maximum jitter probability at k=1 corresponds to about unit SNRs. This case can be met most frequently in the HR-CGH array CNVs measurements within a typical SNR range of 0.1, …, 100 which follows from [1–5,9–11,29,27,28,30,39].Provided the jitter distribution (15), the confidence limits for CNVs can be found in some sense. From the standpoint of practical usefulness, it is always desirable to find the confidence endpoints such that the true changes exist within the confidence interval with high probability. In this paper, we specify the confidence UB and LB in the three-sigma sense to guarantee the probability of 99.73% or error probability of 0.27% for CNVs measured using HR-CGH microarray.To find UB and LB, we suppose that the breakpoint locations ilare given. Otherwise, we use the median as shown in [23]. Note that the median does not match the Gaussian noise and the estimates may need corrections. To apply the median, consider a measurement yn, n∈[1, M], such as that shown in Fig. 1. Because the median is efficient asymptotically in large measurement noise [40], apply the median(23)xˆ=argminx∑i=1W|yi−x|=med{yi|i=1W}sequentially V times with windows W1<W2<⋱<WV, provided that eachWv,v∈[1,V], is odd,(24)xˆn−W1−12(1)=med(yn−i|i=0W1−1),xˆn−W2−12(2)=med(xn−i(1)|i=0W2−1),⋮xˆn−WV−12(V)=med(xn−i(V−1)|i=0WV−1),until the CNVs structure becomes clear. If the computation time is not an issue, then the window lengthWvcan be increased as 3, 5, 7, …, until the next window gives no change. Alternatively, follow the recommendations given in [41] regarding the window optimality. By (24), the final median estimate becomesxˆnmed=xˆn(V). The locations of edges in thexˆnmedstructure determine the candidate breakpoints vectorN*=[n1*n2*…nL*]T. The estimateNˆ=[nˆ1nˆ2…nˆL]TofNcan then be found by adjustingN*visually or using any of the optimization procedures such as the combined ML estimation algorithm [23]. ProvidedNˆ, the componentaˆlof the estimateaˆ=[aˆ1aˆ2…aˆL+1]Tof the segmental vector (2) can be found by averaging.In white Gaussian noise environment, simple averaging is most efficient between the breakpoints as being optimal in the sense of the minimum produced noise. Provided the estimateiˆl, simple averaging applied on an interval of Nl=nl−nl−1 probes from nl−1 to nl−1 gives the following estimate for the segmental change(25)aˆj=1Nj∑v=nj−1nj−1yv,where mean value isE{aˆj}=ajand variance isσˆj2=σj2/Nj. The Gaussian pdf ofaˆjis thus(26)pj(x)=Nj2πσj2exp−(x−aj)2Nj2σj2and the error probability foraˆjto exceed a threshold ɛ around actual ajcan be found as(27)PE(Nj)=2∫aj+ɛ∞pj(x)dx=erfcμNj2,where erfc(x) is the complementary error function andμ=ɛ/σ2is the normalized threshold. A distinctive feature of PE(Nj) is that it does not depend on the unknown change aj.Example 1: If the number of segmental probes is Nj=10 and the allowed threshold is μ=0.1, then the error probability will be about 75% that is unacceptable for applications. It is shown in [37] that such situations can be met in CNVs measurements.Rigorously, the segmental confidence UB can be formed in the 3-sigma sense asaˆjUB=E{aˆj}+3σj2/Nj. However, neither the actualaj=E{aˆj}nor multiple measurements necessary to approach ajby averaging are available. We thus specify UB and LB approximately as(28)aˆjUB≅aˆj+3σj2Nj,(29)aˆjLB≅aˆj−3σj2Nj.Example 2: The jth segment is measured with Nj=80. The segmental mean and variance are estimated in Log2 Ratio asaˆj=1.45745andσj2=27.99965. By (28) and (29), the UB and LB becomeaˆjUB=1.51322andaˆjLB=1.40167. The confidence interval for ajis thus 1.40167⩽aj⩽1.51322.The jitter confidence left boundary (JLB)JlLand right boundary (JRB)JlRcan be determined for the lth breakpointiˆlusing (22) as follows. Consider the jitter probability (22) for knownγl−andγl+. Increase k in (22) from zero untilPk(γl−,γl+)<0.27%. Accept the relevant value of k as the right jitterklR. Next, reduce k from zero untilPk(γl−,γl+)<0.27%and accept the relevant value of k as the left jitterklL.Example 3: Consider Fig. 4. The left jitter is limited here for P=0.0027 with k=−4 and the right jitter with k=2. For the average probe resolution ofr¯=30kb, the left jitter and right jitter are specified as4r¯and2r¯.The JLB and JRB can be defined with respect to nlasJlL=nl−klLandJlR=nl+klR. Now observe that nlis unknown and use the estimatenˆl. If it happens thatnˆllies at the right endpoint, then the true nlcan be supposed to beklRpoints to the left. Otherwise, ifnˆllies at the left endpoint, then ilcan be foundklLpoints to the right. Approximate JLB and JRB are thus the following:(30)JlL≅nˆl−klR,(31)JlR≅nˆl+klL.By combining (28)–(31), the UB maskBnUand LB maskBnLcan be formed to outline the confidence interval for CNVs as shown in Fig. 6for typical HR-CGH array measurements. The following basic properties of the masks can be recognized:•The CNVs exist betweenBnUandBnLwith the probability of 99.73% (3-sigma).IfBnUorBnLcovering two or more breakpoints is uniform, then there is a probability of no changes in this region.If bothBnUandBnLcovering two or more breakpoints are uniform, then there is a high probability of no changes in this region.In [37], some HR-CGH array measurements were tested by the UB and LB masks to demonstrate that the estimation errors can be substantial and higher measurement resolution is required.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Measurements of genome changes using the HR-CGH array are available with the probe resolution of 0.2, …, 40kb. They are provided in the presence of large white Gaussian noise that causes the segmental SNRs to range around unity from about 0.1 to 100. Under such conditions, estimates of segmental changes and breakpoint locations are often accompanied with large and even unacceptable errors. We have shown that jitter in the CNVs breakpoint locations can be approximated with the discrete skew Laplace distribution. In order to give medical experts additional information about genomic changes, we have employed this distribution and found the confidence limits in the three-sigma sense to guarantee an existence of CNVs with the probability of 99.73%. Note that these limits should be used in the lower bound sense, because some probabilities were ignored while deriving the jitter distribution. That means that large jitter in the CNVs breakpoints predicted by the confidence UB and LB may be even larger in practice.
