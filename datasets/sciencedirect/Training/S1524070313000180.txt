@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Reliable estimation of visual saliency is helpful to guide many computer graphics tasks including shape matching, simplification, segmentation, etc. Inspired by basic principles induced by psychophysics studies, we propose a novel approach for computing saliency for 3D mesh surface considering both local contrast and global rarity. First, a multi-scale local shape descriptor is introduced to capture local geometric features with various regions, which is rotationally invariant. Then, we present an efficient patch-based local contrast method based on the multi-scale local descriptor. The global rarity is defined by its specialty to all other vertices. To be more efficient, we compute it on clusters first and interpolate on vertices later. Finally, our mesh saliency is obtained by the linear combination of the local contrast and the global rarity. Our method is efficient, robust, and yields mesh saliency that agrees with human perception. The algorithm is tested on many models and outperformed previous works. We also demonstrated the benefits of our algorithm in some geometry processing applications.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
When people watch objects, they always tend to move their eyes to salient regions that attract their attention. Saliency detection has made substantial progresses in signal processing, computer vision, and even biological literature (e.g., [1–6]). Detecting such visually important regions on 3D mesh models, i.e., mesh saliency, is a significant component in computer graphics [7]. The extracted mesh saliency has been widely used in many aspects of geometry processing to enhance the generated results, such as shape matching, alignments, mesh simplification, mesh smoothing, and segmentation, etc.The neurophysiological basis and psychophysics of visual saliency have been widely studied over the last decades. Studies have shown that visual saliency is closely related to brain’s response to visual stimuli, which is often associated with local contrast and global rarity [8,9]. Current approaches on mesh saliency only considered the local contrast of salient regions, that is, the distinctive differences with their surrounding neighborhoods. However, the global rarity, which means that human visual system is sensitive to less frequent features and suppress frequently occurring features [8], has never been considered in detecting mesh saliency.In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for detecting mesh saliency based on the observation that salient regions are both locally prominent and globally rare. For the measurement of local contrast, we introduce a new multi-scale local descriptor, which captures local geometric features with different sizes of regions. Instead of measuring the local contrast on vertices individually, we calculate the local contrast on over-segmented patches with respect to their neighboring patches in a more efficient manner. Our local descriptor is rotational invariant and performs more robustly than previous single-scale descriptors. For the measurement of global rarity, we define the global saliency of each vertex based on its contrast to all other vertices, which enables that geometrically similar vertices have comparable saliency values. To reduce the computation, we cluster the vertices based on the local descriptor. Then we compute the global rarity on cluster centers and interpolate individual global rarity from cluster saliency. We test our method on various 3D models and compare it with current method of Lee et al. [7]. The experiments show that our method obtains perceptually better results than their method. Furthermore, we also adopt our extracted saliency maps in geometric applications including feature-preserved mesh smoothing, simplification, and sampling.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the global rarity principle of visual saliency has been used in detecting saliency in 3D geometric contents and has obtained promising results over previous methods.
