@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The location routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (LRPSPD) is a new variant of the location routing problem (LRP). The objective of LRPSPD is to minimize the total cost of a distribution system including vehicle traveling cost, depot opening cost, and vehicle fixed cost by locating the depots and determining the vehicle routes to simultaneously satisfy the pickup and the delivery demands of each customer. LRPSPD is NP-hard since its special case, LRP, is NP-hard. Thus, this study proposes a multi-start simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm for solving LRPSPD which incorporates multi-start hill climbing strategy into simulated annealing framework. The MSA algorithm is tested on 360 benchmark instances to verify its performance. Results indicate that the multi-start strategy can significantly enhance the performance of traditional single-start simulated annealing algorithm. Our MSA algorithm is very effective in solving LRPSPD compared to existing solution approaches. It obtained 206 best solutions out of the 360 benchmark instances, including 126 new best solutions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Locating depots and planning vehicle routes are two critical issues in the design of distribution systems. These two issues are often tackled seperately, leading to suboptimal configurations for distribution systems [1]. There has thus been a growing interest in the location routing problem (LRP) over the last few decades. The LRP simultaneously determines the facility location problem (FLP) and the vehicle routing problem (VRP) to satisfy each customer's demand for service in a way that minimizes the sum of transportation costs, depot opening costs, and vehicle fixed costs. LRP has applications across a wide variety of fields including newspaper delivery [2,3], drink distribution [4], bill delivery [5], military equipment [6], and retailing [7]. However, it fails to consider another important aspect of the supply chain network: the flow in a supply chain network may be bidirectional. That is, customers may have two types of demands: pickup demand and delivery demand. For example, as more and more customers demand quick after-sales service when products fail, consumer electronics distributors and manufacturers need to both deliver products and parts to retailers and collect failed or recycled products from them. Given this, Karaoglan et al. [8] proposed the location routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (LRPSPD), an extension of the LRP and the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (VRPSPD). VRPSPD considers the situation where customers have both pickup and delivery demands, a situation which occurs in many industries such as book distribution [9], laundry service in hotels [10], and soft drink industry [11]. In LRPSPD, customers also have both pickup and delivery demands. These demands are satisfied by vehicles dispatched from multiple potential depots, instead of a single depot as in VRPSPD. LRPSPD has many applications. For example, in the beverage and grocery store chain industries [12], beverage manufacturers not only distribute beverages but also collect empty bottles, while grocery store chains distribute merchandise to and retrieve empty pallets from customers at the same time.LRPSPD can be stated as follows. There is a set of customers each of which has known coordinates, pickup demand, and delivery demand, and a set of potential depot locations each of which has known coordinates and fixed capacity. The objective is determining locations of open depots and service routes of vehicles to minimize total cost which consists of travel cost of vehicles, opening cost of depots, and fixed cost of vehicles, while satisfying all customers’ pickup and delivery demands. Each customer is assigned to an open depot and served exactly once by a vehicle dispatched from the depot. All vehicle routes must originate from and end at the same depot. The total amount of freight in a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle's capacity at any time. The freight includes remaining delivery demand to be satisfied and the cumulated pickup demand satisfied by the vehicle. Total pickup demand or delivery demand of the customers assigned to an open depot cannot exceed the depot's capacity.The LRPSPD problem is an NP-hard problem since its special case LRP is NP hard [13]. Therefore, it is unlikely that the optimal solution to a large-scale LRPSPD instance can be obtained within a reasonable amount of time. Thus, meta-heuristics seem to be the only viable way for solving large-scale LRPSPD instances. Simulated annealing based heuristics have been successfully applied to problems in a wide variety of fields [14–20]. This study proposes a multi-start simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm for solving the LRPSPD. MSA combines the advantages of the simulated annealing algorithm with the multi-start hill climbing strategy and has been successfully applied to various hard combinatorial optimization problems [21–24].The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. ‘Literature review’ section reviews relevant literature. ‘Multi-start simulated annealing algorithm for LRPSPD’ section describes the proposed MSA algorithm. ‘Experimental results’ section presents empirical experiments to assess the performance of the proposed MSA algorithm. Finally, ‘Conclusions and future research’ section concludes the paper with and points out future research directions.
