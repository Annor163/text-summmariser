@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study is to understand confinement effect on the dynamical behaviour of a droplet immersed in an immiscible liquid subjected to a simple shear flow. The lattice Boltzmann method, which uses a forcing term and a recolouring algorithm to realize the interfacial tension effect and phase separation respectively, is adopted to systematically study droplet deformation and breakup in confined conditions. The effects of capillary number, viscosity ratio of the droplet to the carrier liquid, and confinement ratio are studied. The simulation results are compared against the theoretical predictions, experimental and numerical data available in literature. We find that increasing confinement ratio will enhance deformation, and the maximum deformation occurs at the viscosity ratio of unity. The droplet is found to orient more towards the flow direction with increasing viscosity ratio or confinement ratio. Also, it is noticed that the wall effect becomes more significant for the confinement ratios larger than 0.4. Finally, the critical capillary number, above which the droplet breakup occurs, is found to be mildly affected by the confinement for the viscosity ratio of unity. Upon increasing the confinement ratio, the critical capillary number increases for the viscosity ratios less than unity, but decreases for the viscosity ratios more than unity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Emulsions consist of immiscible fluids commonly found in production processes in food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. Since the droplet size and shape determine important emulsion properties such as stability, rheology, and particle morphology, it is important to understand the mechanism of droplet deformation and breakup during emulsification. In addition, the study of droplet deformation and breakup can provide valuable insights into immiscible fluid displacement in porous media, which plays an important role in enhanced oil recovery, geologic CO2 sequestration, and remediation of nonaqueous-phase liquids. In recent years, the droplet deformation and breakup have received more attention because of the growing interest in microfluidic technologies, where droplets are circulated in channels and their size is often comparable with or even smaller than channel dimension. A significant number of theoretical, experimental and numerical studies have been reported regarding droplet deformation and breakup in a shear flow since the pioneering work of Taylor [1]. The main feature of shear flow is its relative simplicity, while it contains rich physics [2].As sketched in Fig. 1, a spherical droplet with radius R is initially placed halfway between two parallel plates that are separated by a distance H. Shear flow is introduced to this system by the movement of the plates with equal but opposite velocities U, and the resulting shear rate isγ˙=2U/H. The droplet and the carrier fluid are assumed to have equal densities ρ, a constant interfacial tension σ, and their dynamic viscosities are μdand μm. In the simple shear flow, two most important forces exerting on the droplet are: the viscous forces (μmγ˙R2), leading the droplet to deform and turn towards the flow direction, and the capillary forces (σR), resisting the droplet deformation and retaining the spherical shape of the droplet. Consequently, the droplet undergoes an elongation in the direction of the L-axis, and a compression in the direction of the B-axis (see the right panel of Fig. 1). The capillary number, which is defined asCa=γ˙Rμm/σ, is used to measure the relative magnitude of viscous and capillary forces. The inertial force can also influence the dynamical behaviour of the droplet, and its importance is described by the Reynolds number, defined as the ratio of inertial to viscous forces i.e.Re=ργ˙R2/μm. In addition to the capillary and Reynolds numbers, the viscosity ratio (λ=μd/μm) and the proximity of droplet to the walls are found to affect strongly the deformation and breakup of the droplet. The proximity is evaluated by the confinement ratio, defined as 2R/H. Under consideration of low capillary number and confinement ratio, the droplet will eventually become ellipsoidal in the Stokes flow regime (Re<1). The deformation parameter D can be defined by the lengths of the major (L) and minor (B) axes of the deformed droplet, i.e.(1)D=L−BL+B.With increasing Ca, the droplet can reach a steady state but deviate from the ellipsoidal shape. This causes difficulty in obtaining the correct values of deformation parameter and orientation angle (θ), which is defined as the angle between the droplet major axis and the horizontal plane. As the capillary number is further increased above the critical value, the capillary forces can no longer retain the shape of droplet; the dominant viscous forces lead the droplet to form a long thin neck and finally break up into two or more fragments. The critical capillary number (Cacr), above which the droplet breakup will occur, is influenced by both the viscosity and confinement ratios [3].The interest in droplet deformation dates back to the work of Taylor (1934) [1], who derived a theoretical expression to describe small deformations in the bulk shear flow in terms of the viscosity ratio and the capillary number:(2)DT=19λ+1616λ+16Ca.This expression has been demonstrated to predict experimental results well in a variety of cases, where the value of confinement ratio was around 0.2. However, the influence of wall confinement is not taken into account in Eq. (2). It was reported that the presence of walls has a negligible contribution to the droplet deformation for the confinement ratio 2R/H≤0.4 [4,5]. When the confinement ratio is higher than 0.4, the deformation cannot be predicted accurately by Eq. (2). Moreover, Eq. (2) is not able to describe the droplet deformation for very large viscosity ratios [1,6]. More discussion about this equation can be found in these review papers [7–10]. Taylor derived his model using small deformation perturbation procedure to the first order, with Ca as the expansion parameter, so he obtained a constant orientation angle of 45°. The perturbation procedure was later to be extended to the second order in Ca to yield an expression for the orientation angle [11–14]: θ=(π/4)−((16+19λ)(3+2λ)/80(1+λ))Ca[15]. The orientation angle was also formulated differently in the phenomenological models of Maffetone and Minale [16] and Minale [17].To address the wall confinement effect on droplet behaviour, Shapira and Haber [18] solved the Stokes flows around a droplet using the method of reflection, which takes into account the relative position of the droplet to the wall. The resulting SH model combines the Taylor deformation and an additional term accounting for the influence of walls on the deformation:(3)DSH=DT1+CS1+2.5λ1+λRH3,where CSis referred to as a shape parameter and its value depends on the relative position of the droplet to the walls. For a droplet positioned halfway between the two walls CSis taken as 5.6996.To predict the droplet deformation under transient conditions, Maffettone and Minale [16] proposed a phenomenological model, i.e. MM model, in which the droplet shape is assumed to remain ellipsoidal. A second order tensorS, whose eigenvalues reflect the squares of the semi-axes of an ellipsoid, is used to describe the droplet shape. Based on this assumption, they derived an evolution equation for the tensorS, which consists of a co-rotational derivative, the contributions of the viscous stress and the capillary force. The values of the semi-axes for several typical flows were predicted, including the simple shear flow, the uniaxial extensional flow and the planar hyperbolic flow. In particular, for the simple shear flow, the deformation parameter in a steady state is calculated as(4)DMM=m12+Ca2−m12+(1−m22)Ca2m2Ca,where(5)m1=40(λ+1)(2λ+3)(19λ+16),and(6)m2=52λ+3+3Ca22+6Ca2.The droplet deformation was also investigated experimentally by Sibillo et al. [19] for the viscosity ratio of unity. Three different capillary numbers, i.e. 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, were studied for the confinement ratios ranging from 0.14 to 1.0. For the same capillary number, the droplet could obtain a more elongated shape for larger confinement ratios. Also, the droplet shape deviates from ellipsoid at very high confinement ratios, i.e., 2R/H≥0.8. A similar study, for a range of viscosity ratios, was performed by Vananroye et al. [6]. The difference in the droplet deformation is not significant for different viscosity ratios at low confinement ratios. However, this difference grows considerably at large confinement ratios, and is more significant at large capillary numbers. In an attempt to match the experimental results regarding large deformation at large capillary numbers (e.g., Ca=0.3) with an analytical expression, two models were proposed. One is the orientation angle scaled SH model. However, it suffers from the difficulty of estimating the orientation angle at high confinement ratios [7]. The other is a combination of the aforementioned two models (i.e., SH and MM). Specifically, the term DTin the SH model is replaced by DMMin the MM model, leading to a new model, called as the MMSH model:(7)DMMSH=DMM1+CS1+2.5λ1+λRH3.Since the MMSH model does not need to estimate the droplet orientation angle and its predictions agree well with the experimental data [6], it will be used in Section 3 for validation of our numerical results. In addition, Minale [17] refined the phenomenological MM model, by forcing the model to recover the analytical limits of the SH model for moderate confinement ratios, i.e. 2R/H≤0.5. For large confinement ratios, the experimental data from Sibillo et al. [19] and Vananroye et al. [6], were used to re-evaluate the coefficients m1 and m2 in the MM model.Complementing theoretical and experimental studies, numerical simulations have been extensively used to investigate the droplet deformation and breakup in a simple shear flow [3,4,20–24]. Among these works, Janssen and his co-workers [3,23,24] used the boundary integral method (BIM) to study the effect of viscosity and confinement ratios on droplet deformation and the critical capillary number. It was found that the simulated shape of the droplet and the critical capillary number are both in excellent agreement with the experimental results. However, the BIM is usually for the solution of Stokes flow, in which the fluid inertia is totally neglected. Also, it suffers from the difficulties of accessing the low viscosity ratio regime [3], and of dealing with topological changes such as breakup and coalescence of the interfaces [7,25,26]. These disadvantages can be overcome by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which tracks evolution of the distribution function of an assembly of molecules and is built upon microscopic models and mesoscopic kinetic equations. The LBM can capture multiphase interface and describe interfacial dynamics such as phase segregation and interfacial tension through the incorporation of intermolecular interactions. A number of multiphase and multicomponent models have been proposed, which can be divided into four main types: colour gradient model [27], free-energy model [28], interparticle-potential model [29], and mean-field theory model [30]. Although the droplet dynamics in a shear flow was successfully simulated by the former three models or their variants [31–36], none of them has systematically examined the impact of viscosity and confinement ratios on the droplet deformation and breakup, which is the focus of this work. In particular, the colour gradient LBM is used here because of its advantages such as low spurious currents, high numerical accuracy and strict mass conservation for each fluid which have been demonstrated in our recent works [37,38].We consider isothermal motion of two immiscible fluids and adopt a continuum surface force (CSF) model [39] to describe the system. The CSF formulation allows us to consider the two phases as a single fluid with space-dependent properties and replaces the jump condition at the interface with an additional force that acts only in the interface region. Unlike a two-fluid formulation, it does not need to solve a moving boundary problem, which is computationally expensive and extremely difficult to implement especially when large topological changes occur around the interface. In the CSF formulation, the flow of two immiscible fluids is governed by a single set of Navier–Stokes equations (NSEs):(8)∇·u→=0,(9)∂(ρu→)∂t+∇·ρu→u→=−∇p+∇·[μ(∇u→+∇u→T)]+F→s,where t is the time,u→is the fluid velocity, ρ is the total density, p is the pressure, and μ is the dynamic viscosity. The last term in Eq. (9) represents the interfacial tension force acting at the interface between the two fluids and is defined as(10)Fs→=σκn→δΓ,where σ is the interfacial tension; κ, the local interface curvature;n→, the unit normal to the interface; and δΓ, the Dirac delta function used to localize the force explicitly at the interface, which should satisfy(11)∫−∞∞δΓdz=1,in order to recover properly the stress jump condition in the sharp-interface limit. Here z is the spatial location normal to the interface.Although Eqs. (8) and (9) allow computing the velocity field, an advection equation has to be additionally solved to capture the evolution of interface in traditional multiphase solvers, e.g., the volume-of-fluid (VOF) and level-set methods, where the sophisticated interface reconstruction algorithm or unphysical re-initialization process is often required. In order to avoid these issues, we use the lattice Boltzmann colour gradient model, first proposed by Gunstensen et al. [27] and later improved by Halliday and his coworkers [40], to simulate the dynamical behaviour of a droplet subjected to a simple shear flow. The colour gradient model possesses many advantages in simulating immiscible two-phase flows, including the ability of capturing interface automatically, low spurious velocities, high numerical accuracy and strict mass conservation for each fluid. In this model, two sets of distribution functionsfiRandfiBare introduced to represent the “red” and “blue” fluids. The total distribution function is defined byfi=fiR+fiB, which undergoes a Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) collision step as(12)fi†(x→,t)=fi(x→,t)−1τ(fi(x→,t)−fieq(x→,t))+Φi,wherefi(x→,t)is the total distribution function in the ith velocity direction at the positionx→and time t,fieqis the equilibrium distribution function of fi,fi†is the post-collision distribution function, τ is the dimensionless relaxation time, and Φiis the forcing term.The equilibrium distribution function is obtained by a second-order Taylor expansion of Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution with respect to the local velocityu→:(13)fieq=ρwi1+e→i·u→cs2+(e→i·u→)22cs4−u→22cs2,where ρ is calculated by ρ=ρR+ρBwith the subscripts ‘R’ and ‘B’ referring to the red and blue fluids respectively, csis the speed of sound,e→iis the lattice velocity in the ith direction, andwiis the weight factor. For the three-dimensional 19-velocity (D3Q19) model, the lattice velocitye→iand the weight factors are given by(14)e→i=(0,0,0)c,i=0;(±1,0,0)c,(0,±1,0)c,(0,0,±1)c,i=1,2,…,6;(±1,±1,0)c,(0,±1,±1)c,(±1,0,±1)c,i=7,8,…,18,(15)wi=1/3,i=0;1/18,i=1,2,…,6;1/36,i=7,8,…,18,and the speed of soundcs=c/3=δx/3δtwith δxand δtbeing the lattice length and time step, respectively.The spatial distribution of the two fluids is described using a colour function (or phase-field function), which is defined as(16)ρN(x→,t)=ρR(x→,t)−ρB(x→,t)ρR(x→,t)+ρB(x→,t),−1≤ρN≤1.By definingn→=−∇ρN/|∇ρN|and δΓ=|∇ρN|/2, Eq. (10) can be further written as(17)Fs→=−12σκ∇ρN,where the local interface curvature κ is related to the unit normal to the interface by(18)κ=−(I−n→⊗n→)·∇·n→=−∇·n→,and I is the second-order identity tensor. With the interfacial tension force given by Eq. (17), the forcing term Φithat is applied to realize the interfacial tension effect, reads as [41](19)Φi=1−12τwiei→−u→cs2+ei→·u→cs4ei→·Fs→δt.According to Guo et al. [42], the local fluid velocity should be defined to incorporate the spatially varying interfacial tension force, i.e.,(20)ρu→(x→,t)=∑ifi(x→,t)e→i+12Fs→(x→,t)δt.Using the Chapman–Enskog multiscale expansion, Eq. (12) can reduce to the NSEs in the low frequency, long wavelength limit with the pressure and the fluid viscosity defined by(21)p=ρcs2,(22)μ=ρcs2τ−12δt.To allow for unequal viscosities of the two fluids, we determine the viscosity of the fluid mixture by a harmonic mean, i.e.(23)1μρN=1+ρN2μR+1−ρN2μB,where μk(k=R or B) is the dynamic viscosity of fluid k. It has been shown that the choice of Eq. (23) can ensure a constant viscosity stress across the interface, which provides higher accuracy than other choices [43].The partial derivatives required for the curvature and normal vector calculations are obtained using the 19-point compact finite-difference stencil [44]. For example, for a variable ψ, its partial derivatives can be calculated by(24)∂ψ(x→)∂xa=1cs2∑iwiψ(x→+ei→δt)eia.Although the forcing term generates an interfacial tension, it does not guarantee the immiscibility of both fluids. To promote phase segregation and maintain a reasonable interface, the segregation (recolouring) algorithm of Latva-Kokko and Rothman is used [45]. It can overcome the lattice pinning problem and creates a symmetric distribution of particles around the interface so that unphysical spurious currents can be effectively reduced. Following Latva-Kokko and Rothman, the post-segregation (recoloured) distribution functions of the red and blue fluids are(25)fiR(x→,t)=ρRρfi†(x→,t)+βρRρBρwicos(φi)|e→i|,fiB(x→,t)=ρBρfi†(x→,t)−βρRρBρwicos(φi)|e→i|,where β is the segregation parameter and is set to be 0.7 for numerical stability and model accuracy [46]; φiis the angle between the colour gradient and the lattice vectore→i, which is defined by(26)cos(φi)=e→i·∇ρN|e→i||∇ρN|.After the recolouring step, the red and blue distribution functions propagate to the neighbouring lattice nodes, known as propagation or streaming step:(27)fik(x→+ei→δt,t+δt)=fik(x→,t),k=RorB,and the resulting distribution functions are then used to calculate the densities of both fluids i.e.ρk=∑ifik.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The influence of capillary number, viscosity ratio and confinement ratio have been systematically studied for droplet deformation and breakup in a simple shear flow. Increasing confinement leads to an increase in droplet deformation for a wide range of viscosity ratios, and the droplet with the same viscosity as the carrier fluid presents the largest deformation at all confinement ratios. The orientation angle of the deformed droplet decreases with increasing viscosity ratio. It is observed that the presence of walls has a more significant impact on both droplet deformation and orientation angle when the confinement ratio increases to 0.4 or higher. The flowfield inside and around the droplet shows that confinement and viscosity ratios can lead to a perplex pattern which may affect droplet behaviour. Finally, the critical capillary number, above which the droplet breakup occurs, is investigated for a broad range of flow conditions. Depending on the value of viscosity ratio, the confinement ratio has different effects on the critical capillary number: as the confinement increases, the critical capillary number increases for λ<1 but decreases for λ>1; and for λ=1 the critical capillary number is kept at a value of around 0.4, regardless of the confinement ratio.
