@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We propose a frequency domain generalized likelihood ratio test for testing nonstationarity in time series. The test is constructed in the frequency domain by comparing the goodness of fit in the log-periodogram regression under the varying coefficient fractionally exponential models. Under such a locally stationary specification, the proposed test is capable of detecting dynamic changes of short-range and long-range dependences in a regression framework. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed test statistic is known under the null stationarity hypothesis, and its finite sample distribution can be approximated by bootstrap. Numerical results show that the proposed test has good power against a wide range of locally stationary alternatives.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The stationarity assumption plays an essential role in making inference for time series analysis. Under this assumption, statistical properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality hold for standard inference in time series analysis, based only on one realization. However, the stationarity assumption might not be realistic in practice, especially when the observed time span is long or the series is apparently affected by some natural factors. For example, the influenza-like illness incidence has different dynamics during the epidemic period and non-epidemic period; the tree ring data exhibit time varying dynamics due to different weather and environmental conditions over the years. As another example in finance, volatilities of returns usually exhibit strong dependencies but the level of persistence is likely to change over time due to numerous unpredictable economic factors (Ray and Tsay, 2002).In order to validate the analysis based on stationary modeling, some preliminary checking of stationarity is necessary. Usually, visualizing the time series plot is a useful way of spotting certain types of nonstationarity such as the mean and variance change over time, but this naive method makes somehow difficult to explore more complex dynamic changes in the dependence structures. An alternative approach for checking stationarity is through the hypothesis testing. In the literature, there are various tests under different specifications of nonstationarity. Early development focused on the change point problem subject to a specific parameter under a fully parametric setting (Inclán and Tiao, 1994). Recent research focuses on nonstationary modeling with slowly varying dependence structures. The pioneering work in this area was given by Priestley (1965) by introducing the evolutionary spectrum with the power-frequency analog of stationary spectrum under a time-dependent framework. Later, Priestley and Subba Rao (1969) further developed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure to test the homogeneity of evolutionary spectra. This test is easy to implement and is particularly powerful for detecting nonstationarity against a uniformly modulated process. However, due to completely unspecified time-frequency interactions in the ANOVA model, this ANOVA test is less powerful against other types of nonstationarity, such as the class of varying coefficient AR models.In contrast to Priestley’s approach, Dahlhaus (1997) gave an alternative specification for the locally stationary process with smoothly varying spectra. The well-developed asymptotic theories under this local stationarity framework bring about its popularity among other approaches in the literature (e.g.  Adak, 1998; Guo et al., 2003; Nason et al., 2000; Davis et al., 2006). Accordingly, several testing procedures for detecting nonstationarity are constructed under Dahlhaus’s locally stationary framework. Sakiyama and Taniguchi (2003) proposed the likelihood ratio test, Wald test and Lagrange multiplier test for testing a specific structure in a locally stationary Gaussian process. These likelihood-based tests require fully specified hypotheses and the results are often sensitive to model mis-specification. Sergides and Paparoditis (2009) proposed a more general procedure for detecting local stationarity based on a goodness of fit measure, which allows a semiparametric specification for the null model against a unspecified locally stationary alternative model. Similar idea was also applied for validating and monitoring stationarity for a process over time (Paparoditis, 2010).Among the studies for testing nonstationarity, most of the interest focuses on the changes of short-range dependence while the issue concerning long-memory nonstationarity is rarely addressed. Regarding such issue, change point approaches have been suggested under fully parametric settings (e.g.  Beran and Terrin, 1996; Ray and Tsay, 2002). Recently, Beran (2009) incorporated long-memory structure into the locally stationary process framework in a time domain approach, which mainly concerned on estimation problems rather than hypothesis testing issues.In this paper, we propose a general testing procedure which aims to detect the dynamic change for both short-memory and long-memory structures. Our approach is built on a semiparametric class of models, called varying-coefficient fractionally exponential (VC-FEXP) models, whose specification is extended from a stationary fractionally exponential (FEXP) model of Beran (1993) by allowing parameters in the spectra to vary smoothly over time. This VC-FEXP model is appealing not only because the specification is very flexible but also because the corresponding inference can be carried out in a regression framework. The regression used here is a time-varying version of the log-periodogram regression. Under this regression framework, we suggest a generalized goodness-of-fit test to detect various aspects of nonstationarity.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section  2, the proposed VC-FEXP model is introduced, under which the varying-coefficient log-periodogram regression and the corresponding local linear fitting are described. Section  3 defines the hypotheses and the test statistic for detecting nonstationarity. Numerical results are reported in Section  4, including a real data example. Section  5 is the summary.For the purpose of testing stationarity, we first suggest a general family of nonstationary models represented via time-varying spectra in a locally stationary process framework. This general alternative model, called the varying-coefficient FEXP (VC-FEXP), is a natural generalization of the FEXP model (Beran, 1993) by allowing parameters to vary smoothly over time. Specifically, a VC-FEXP model is defined via the following time-varying spectra:(1)ft(ω)≡f(ω;θ(u))=|1−eiω|−2d(u)exp{∑k=0pθk(u)ψk(ω)},u=t/T∈[0,1],where the time indextis represented by the re-scaled timeu=t/T,ψ0(ω)=1and{ψk(⋅):k=1,…,p}are some continuous and even functions defined on[−π,π]satisfying∫0πψk2(ω)dω<∞.d(u)andθ(u)≡(θ0(u),…,θp(u))′, having continuous second derivatives, characterize the long-range and short-range dependence structures of the underlying process respectively.Whend(u)=d,θk(u)=θkandψk(ω)=cos(kω), this generalized model (1) reduces to the FEXP model (Beran, 1993) as a special case, which has a very flexible form of approximating a variety of short-range and long-range dependence structures for a stationary process. In addition, FEXP plays an important role on long-memory parameter estimation (Beran, 1993; Hurvich and Brodsky, 2001). Inherited from these advantages associated with FEXP models, the VC-FEXP model not only provides a flexible semiparametric family for approximating locally stationary processes but also serves as a general alternative model for testing nonstationarity by examining the homogeneity of the coefficient functionsd(u)andθ(u).Regarding the model fitting, since the VC-FEXP model is specified in the frequency domain, it is natural to use the log-periodogram regression for estimating the time-varying spectra. In Section  2.1, a customized log-periodogram regression is introduced and the time-varying coefficient functions are estimated using the local polynomial fitting described in Section  2.2.For the ease of illustration, we first review the log-periodogram regression for a stationary FEXP process and then give an analogous version for a locally stationary VC-FEXP process. Assume that a time series data{Xt:t=1,2,…,T}are observed and define the periodogram ordinatesI(ωℓ,T)=(2πT)−1|∑t=1TXte−itωℓ,T|2,ωℓ,T=2πℓ/T,ℓ=1,2,…,[(T−1)/2].Under a stationary FEXP model, it is well known thatI(ωℓ,T)satisfies the log-periodogram regression:(2)logI(ωℓ,T)=logf(ωℓ,T;θ)+logZℓ=γ−2dlog|1−eiωℓ,T|+∑k=0pθkψk(ωℓ,T)+ϵℓ,wheref(ω;θ)is the spectral density of the FEXP process,{Zℓ}are asymptotically independent and identically distributed (iid) fromχ22/2withE[logχ22/2]≡γthe Euler’s constant,ϵℓ≡logZℓ−γand{ϵℓ}are nearly iid random errors. Under (2) and the given basis functionsψk(⋅)’s, the regression coefficientsdandθkcan easily be estimated by the ordinary least squares. This least squares approach has been widely used in the literature for estimating the spectral density of a stationary processes. In particular, it provides an easy-to-use semiparametric estimation for the long-memory parameter (Geweke and Porter-Hudak, 1983; Beran, 1993; Robinson, 1995; Moulines and Soulier, 1999; Hurvich and Brodsky, 2001).Following similar ideas, the conventional log-periodogram regression (2) is adapted for a locally stationary VC-FEXP process{Xt,T:t=1,2,…,T}to account for time-varying spectra (1). Since the coefficient functionsd(u)andθk(u)in (1) are smoothly varying, the process is nearly stationary within a short period of time. Therefore, under the consideration of suitable localized periodogram estimates, a time-frequency version of (2) can be developed. In this work, we consider two types of local periodogram estimates: the blockwise periodogram estimate and its smoothed version. To define these two estimates, we need the following notations. LetNbe an integer as the block size,Mbe an integer as the number of blocks,tjbe the midpoint of thejth block of sizeNunder which{tj:j=1,2,…,M}are regularly spaced in the observed time span with a fixed intervalS=tj+1−tj. For notational simplicity and without ambiguity, we assumeNis even in the following descriptions. The time index set for thejth block is defined byBj={tj−[N/2]+1,…,tj,…,tj+[N/2]}. The blockwise periodogram estimate is defined as the conventional periodogram ordinate within each block, i.e.,(3)I(tj,ωℓ,N)=(2πN)−1|∑s=0N−1Xtj−[N/2]+s+1e−isωℓ,N|2,for thejth block, where the locally stationary seriesXt,Tis abbreviated asXtfor short andωℓ,N=2πℓ/N, forℓ=1,2,…,[N/2]. When the block sizeNis relatively small compared toT, the data associated with each block is roughly stationary andI(tj,ωℓ,N)provides a naive estimate for the time-varying spectra around timetj.Dahlhaus (1997) suggested a tapered local periodogram estimate:(4)I(tj,ωℓ,N)=|∑s=0N−1H(s/N)Xtj−[N/2]+s+1e−isωℓ,N|22π∑s=0N−1H2(s/N),whereH(⋅)>0is a taper function, which is essentially a smoothed version of the blockwise estimate in (3). Later in our numerical analysis, we use the Tukey–Hanning taper function in (4):H(u)=12(1−cos2πu)1{0≤u<1}.Given the local periodogram estimates (3) or (4), a time-varying version of the log-periodogram regression is developed:(5)logI(tj,ωℓ,N)=logftj(ωℓ,N)+logZj,ℓ=γ∗−2d(uj)log|1−eiωℓ,N|+∑k=0pθk(uj)ψk(ωℓ,N)+ϵj,ℓ,whereuj=tj/T,γ∗≡Elog(Zj,ℓ),ϵj,ℓ≡logZj,ℓ−γ∗. When the block sizeNis large, the error terms{ϵj,ℓ}are nearly iid random noise.Note thatψ0(ω)=1. For notational simplicity, we combined two intercept terms in (5) and equalized the following parametrizations:(6)θ0∗(u)≡γ∗+θ0(u),θp+1(u)≡d(u),ψp+1(ω)≡−2log|1−eiω|.Under the reparametrization defined in (6), the regression (5) can be equivalently represented as(7)logI(tj,ωℓ,N)=θ0∗(uj)+∑k=1p+1θk(uj)ψk(ωℓ,N)+ϵj,ℓ,uj=tj/T.The log-periodogram regression in (7) is a special case of varying coefficient models (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1993). A standard procedure to carry out the estimation for the varying coefficient functions is via the local linear fitting (Fan and Gijbels, 1996), described as follows.Givens∈[0,1]anduin a neighborhood ofs, the varying coefficient functions in (7) are approximated by the first-order polynomial:(8)θ0∗(u)≈α0+β0(u−s),θk(u)≈αk+βk(u−s),k=1,2,…,p+1.Letn≡[N/2]. By incorporating the local linear approximation (8) into (7),θk(s)is estimated by minimizing the following local least squares:(9)∑j=1M∑ℓ=1n{logI(tj,ωℓ,N)−∑k(αk+βk(uj−s))ψk(ωℓ,N)}2Kh(uj−s),uj=tj/T,whereKh(x)=h−1K(x/h),K(⋅)is a kernel function andh>0is the bandwidth. The resulting minimizer satisfies(10)(αˆs′,βˆs′)′=(Xs′WsXs)−1Xs′Wsy,whereαˆsandβˆsare the local least square estimates of{αk}and{βk}in vector form, andYj,ℓ≡logI(tj,ωℓ,N),xℓ≡(ψ0(ωℓ,N),ψ1(ωℓ,N),…,ψp+1(ωℓ,N))′,y≡(Y1,1,…,Y1,n,Y2,1,…,Y2,n,…,YM,1,…,YM,n)′,Xs′≡[x1⋯xn⋯x1⋯xnx1(u1−s)⋯xn(u1−s)⋯x1(uM−s)⋯xn(uM−s)],Ws≡diag{(Kh(u1−s),Kh(u2−s),…,Kh(uM−s))′⊗1n},in which1nis ann×1vector with all elements equal to 1.The local polynomial fitting (10) is applied ats=uj=tj/Tfor eachj=1,2,…,Mto solve the local log-spectra estimate:(11)logfˆtj(ωℓ,N)≡Yˆj,ℓ=xℓ′αˆuj.Such a local fitting scheme has been used in a stationary process for estimating the spectral density (Fan and Kreutzberger, 1998) as well as for validating a given parametric form for the spectral density (Fan and Zhang, 2004). We extend the usage of local fitting beyond the stationary framework to estimate the time-varying spectra in a locally stationary framework. The theoretical properties of the local polynomial fitting for varying coefficient models have been well studied (Fan and Zhang, 2004; Cai et al., 2000a) under some regularity conditions, which can be directly applied to our local log-spectra estimate. The regularity conditions include the smoothness conditions on the varying coefficient functionsθk(u)which require to have the continuous second derivatives. Moreover, the basis functionsψk(⋅)need to satisfy∫0πψk2(ω)dω<∞. These two conditions are assumed earlier in Section  2. Besides, the fourth moment of the error term in the log-periodogram regression must be finite. In our case, the error terms in the log periodogram regression are asymptotically distributed as the centered logarithm of weighted linear combination of independentχ22random variables, which have finite fourth moment. The kernel functionK(u)is symmetric, bounded, and has a bound support. The bandwidthhsatisfiesh→0and(Mn)h→∞whereM(the number of blocks in time) andn(the number of frequencies for each block) both go to infinity asT→∞.The local estimateslogfˆtj(ωℓ,N)in (11) reveal useful information about the deviations from stationarity, which are further used in Section  3 to develop a frequency domain generalized likelihood ratio test for detecting nonstationarity under the VC-FEXP specification.Under the VC-FEXP model framework, we detect nonstationarity via evaluating the goodness of fit in the varying-coefficient log-periodogram regression. In the following subsections, we first specify the hypotheses of interest in Section  3.1 and then a nonparametric test is introduced in Section  3.2 by comparing the residual sum of squares (RSS) associated with the null stationary FEXP model against the RSS associated with the alternative nonstationary VC-FEXP model. A bootstrap procedure is also provided for approximating the null distribution of the test statistic in finite samples, detailed in Section  3.3.LetA⊆{0,1,…,p+1}. Under the VC-FEXP model with the time-varying spectra in (1), three types of hypotheses for testing nonstationarity are of interest:•Hypotheses A:H0:θk(u)=θk,k∈Av.s.H1:notH0.Hypotheses B:H0:θk(u)=θk,k∈Av.s.H1:θk(u)=θk,k∈A0⊂A.Hypotheses C:H0:θk(u)=θ0k(u),k∈Av.s.H1:notH0.Hypotheses A detect various kind of nonstationarity. For instance, one can setA={0,1,2,…,p}to test short-memory nonstationarity only, or setA={0,p+1}to test long-memory nonstationarity only. For Hypotheses B, ifA={0,1,2,…,p}andA0=A∖{0}, the problem becomes to test stationarity against a uniformly modulated process considered in Priestley and Subba Rao (1969). Hypotheses C detect the deviation from a fully specified locally stationary structure characterized by{θ0k(u):k∈A}with finite parameters, which can also be viewed as a goodness-of-fit test addressed by Sergides and Paparoditis (2009). Generally speaking, the hypothesis testing for a certain aspect of nonstationarity can possibly be formulated by choosing proper functionsψk(ω)’s and imposing suitable restrictions onθk(u).To test the hypotheses for nonstationarity given in the previous section, the null model and the alternative model are both fitted using the log-periodogram regression defined in Section  2.1. The null model is fitted in a FEXP form with constant regression coefficients using the ordinary least squares; the alternative model is fitted in a VC-FEXP model with time-varying coefficients using the local least squares. We consider a goodness of fit test by comparing the residual sum of squares between two fitted models. This testing methodology is adopted from the generalized likelihood ratio test of Fan et al. (2001) and a similar idea has been used in testing nonlinearity for time series data by Cai et al. (2000b) in the time domain approach.Under the first identity in (6), a constant functionθ0(u)implies a constant intercept functionθ0∗(u)in (7) and vice versa. Accordingly, the null hypothesisH0:θk(u)=θk,fork∈A,is equivalent toH0:θ0∗(u)=θ0∗,θk(u)=θk,fork∈A∖{0}.Due to this equivalence, the ordinary least squares fitting underH0is solved by(θˆ0∗,θˆ)=argminθ0∗,θ∑j=1M∑ℓ=1n{Yj,ℓ−θ0∗−∑k∈A∖{0}θkψk(ωℓ,N)}2,resulting in the fitted residual sum of squares:(12)RSS0=∑j=1M∑ℓ=1n{Yj,ℓ−θˆ0∗−∑k∈A∖{0}θˆkψk(ωℓ,N)}2.On the other hand, under VC-FEXP, the time-varying coefficientsθ0∗(u)’s andθk(u)’s are estimated via the local least squares introduced in Section  2.2, defined in (10) and (11), resulting in the fitted residual sum of squares underH1:(13)RSS1=∑j=1M∑ℓ=1n{Yj,ℓ−logfˆtj(ωℓ,N)}2.Our test statistic is defined as(14)TGLR=RSS0−RSS1RSS1=RSS0RSS1−1.A greater value ofTGLRindicates a stronger evidence favoring nonstationarity, leading to a rejection of the null hypothesis.Theorem 1Under some regularity conditions, the rescaledTGLRis asymptotically distributed as a chi-square distribution under stationarity:Mnr2TGLR∼χbr2,whereb=|A|h{K(0)−12∫K2(u)du},r=K(0)−12∫K2(u)du∫{K(u)−12K∗K(u)}2du,in which|A|is the number of elements in the index setA,K(⋅)is the kernel function andhis the bandwidth used in the local linear fitting   (9).Although the asymptotic distribution forTGLRis available, we found that the test based on the chi-square null distribution tends to over rejectH0for series with moderate sample size. This fact was also noticed in the previous studies based on similar testing procedures. We further consider a bootstrap approach to evaluate thep-value for the GLR test. The detailed steps are summarized in Section  3.3.We use a standard bootstrap procedure to approximate thep-value for the test statistic in (14) in the following steps:1.Under the fitted null and alternative models, we have the fitted values{Yˆj(0)}under the null model and the residuals{ϵij(1)}under the alternative model, whereYˆij(0)=θˆ0∗+∑k∈A∖{0}θˆkψk(ωℓ,N),ϵij(1)=Yj,ℓ−xℓ′αˆuj.The bootstrap samples{ϵij∗(b)}are generated from the empirical distribution of{ϵij(1)}independently to create the bootstrapped responses underH0:Yij∗(b)=Yˆij(0)+ϵij∗(b),i=1,2,…,M,j=1,2,…,n,b=1,2,…,nB.Compute the GLR test statistic based on theb-th bootstrap sample{Yij∗(b)}, denoted asTGLR∗(b), forb=1,2,…,nB.Approximate thep-value ofTGLRby the empirical frequency of{TGLR∗(b)>TGLR}among allb=1,2,…,nB.We investigate the performance of the proposed test in a simulation study under various model settings with different degrees of nonstationarity. Moreover, an application to the tree ring data is illustrated in Section  4.2.We consider five nonstationary models in this simulation study, including a piecewise autoregressive model, two time-varying autoregressive models and two mixture models. The detailed model specifications are given in Table 1, where all{ηt}and{ηj,t}are iidN(0,1). In each setting, data are generated in different degrees of nonstationarity controlled by the indexλ. For the piecewise AR model,λcontrols the proportions of the two sub-models. For the other four models, the nonstationarity is governed through the weight functionwλ(u):wλ(u)=λ1+exp{−10(u−0.5)},u∈[0,1].This weight function, shown in Fig. 1, characterizes the change of dynamics from one sub-model to the other within the observation time period. These five models are stationary whenλ=0and move towards stronger nonstationarity asλincreases. Here, we setλ=0,1,…,5in this simulation. For eachλ, 500 realizations of lengthT=500are generated for Models (a)–(d) and 1000 realizations of lengthT=1000for Model (e). The generalized likelihood ratio test is implemented based on the bootstrappedp-value(nB=500).For Models (a)–(d), we focus on the detection of short-memory nonstationarity with:(15)H0:logft(ω)=θ0+∑k=1pθkcos(kω),(16)v.s.H1:logft(ω)=θ0(u)+∑k=1pθk(u)cos(kω).For Model (e), we emphasize on the dynamic change in long memory with the hypotheses:(17)H0:logft(ω)=θ0−2dlog|1−eiω|+∑k=1pθkcos(kω),(18)v.s.H1:logft(ω)=θ0(u)−2d(u)log|1−eiω|+∑k=1pθk(u)cos(kω).For the alternative (16) or (18), the local polynomial fitting described in Section  2.2 is implemented using a Gaussian kernel with the bandwidth set to be 0.25. The blockwise periodogram (3) and the smoothed local periodogram estimates (4) are both considered, with block settings(M,N)equal to (5,100) for Models (a)–(d) and (10,100) for Model (e). The sizes and powers of the GLR test associated with the blockwise and smoothed local periodogram estimates are demonstrated in Tables 2 and 3respectively, with Model (a)–(d) tested under (15)–(16) withp=7, and Model (e) tested under (17)–(18) withp=0.From Table 2, the empirical sizes of all tested models are close to the nominal value0.05for the null cases atλ=0, and the empirical powers increase along with largerλcorresponding to stronger nonstationarity. We found that the test associated with the smoothed local periodogram estimator tends to over reject the null hypothesis when all the frequenciesΩN≡{ωℓ,N:ℓ=1,2,…,[N/2]}are used in the log-periodogram regression. This might be due to the dependence among the smoothed local periodogram estimates associated with adjacent frequencies. To resolve this issue, we modified the log-periodogram regression by using partial frequencies only, e.g.,1/5ofΩNby regularly selecting one from every 5 frequencies. The resulting sizes and powers are reported in Table 3. Generally speaking, the GLR test associated with the smoothed local periodogram estimates is less powerful than that based on the blockwise periodogram estimates.We further examine the impact of some setting parameters on the GLR test results, focusing on two particular factors: the block setting(M,N)and the number of basis termspspecified in the VC-FEXP model. Fig. 2presents the empirical sizes and powers of Model (d), under three different block settings in (3)(M,N,S)=(5,100,100),(11,50,45)and (15,38,33). The first setting forms non-overlapping blocks; the other two settings form overlapping blocks. Fig. 2 shows similar performance among different settings, indicating that the GLR test is fairly robust to the block settings. Similar results are found for the other models as well. In practice, the block setting determines the trade off between the information in the time scale and in the frequency scale. A setting with smaller blocks preserves lower-resolution information on spectrum but simultaneously has higher-resolution information on the time scale, and vice versa. In other words, large-scale changes on the spectrum is possibly detected faster in time using smaller block setting; but detailed changes in the spectrum are detectable only at a longer period of time using larger block settings. As an example, in Fig. 2, the third block setting(M,N,S)=(15,38,33)creates the shortest block among three settings and results in a slightly higher testing power for the cases with higher degrees of nonstationarity.Regarding the impact of the orderpon the testing performance, Tables 4 and 5show the testing powers for Models (d) and (e) under various choices ofp. Generally speaking, a greaterptends to increase the power for data with lower degrees of non-stationarity but loses power for data with higher degrees of non-stationarity. This phenomenon seems reasonable due to that a VC-FEXP model with a greaterpprovides a more flexible form for nonstationarity detection but simultaneously pays the price of having larger estimation errors leading to power loss. Without any knowledge in advance, our experience suggests to use a more parsimony model with lower orderp. Order selection strategies such as the forward search can be incorporated into the fitting procedure to enhance the testing power but it is beyond the focus of this study.For testing nonstationary long memory, we are aware of the bias of the periodogram associated with very low frequencies. According to our simulation results for the long-memory Model (e), the type I errors of the GLR test are about correct showing that the impact of such bias seems not to be a problem. Another way to avoid such a bias issue is to implement the GLR test based on the local periodogram estimates with frequencies away from zero, in particular the lowest 10% Fourier frequencies are excluded from the analysis. Doing so, the GLR test is expected to lose power. The corresponding results for Model (e) under the same setting as those in Table 5 are reported in Table 6.To sum up, the GLR test based on the blockwise periodogram estimate has good power on detecting various nonstationarities and simultaneously controls the type I error correctly. On the other hand, when implementing the GLR test based on the smoothed local periodogram estimates, we suggest using only a fraction of frequencies to maintain the correct size of the test. Some suggestions for choosing the fraction from the theoretic aspect were addressed by Priestley (1966), but a good selection in practice needs more investigation.We illustrate the proposed testing procedure using the tree ring data given by D.A. Graybill (Source: Rob J. Hyndman’s Time Series Data Library, http://data.is/TSDLdemo. Accessed on April, 2011). This time series measures the chronologies of bristlecone pine trees at Mammoth Creek, Utah, USA, which contains 1990 observations recorded from year 0 to 1989 A.D. Beran (2009) analyzed a subset of these data (consisting of the first 1900 observations) and concluded that the series exhibits long-memory nonstationarity with a decreasing memory parameter. We apply our GLR test to the complete data for further confirmation. For this application, we set the hypotheses (17) versus (18) in two ways:•testing for long-memory nonstationarity only withp=0;testing for general nonstationarity withp=1,3,5,7.No matter whatpis used, thep-values associated with the test using blockwise periodogram are extremely small indicating a strong evidence of nonstationary long-memory in the tree ring data. While the GLR test using the smoothed local periodogram is less significant, allp-values are still less than 0.05. The local polynomial fittings ofd(u)under (18) withp=0using the blockwise periodogram and the local periodogram estimates are shown in Fig. 3. These time-varying patterns agree with that given in Beran (2009) very well. The time-varying patterns are also similar under a more general nonstationary model withp>0.
