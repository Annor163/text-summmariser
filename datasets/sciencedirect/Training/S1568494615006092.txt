@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper aims to ease group decision-making by using an integration of fuzzy AHP (analytic hierarchy process) and fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) and its application to software selection of an electronic firm. Firstly, priority values of criteria in software selection problem have been determined by using fuzzy extension of AHP method. Fuzzy extension of AHP is suggested in this paper because of little computation time and much simpler than other fuzzy AHP procedures. Then, the result of the fuzzy TOPSIS model can be employed to define the most appropriate alternative with regard to this firm's goals in uncertain environment. Fuzzy numbers are presented in all phases in order to overcome any vagueness in decision making process. The final decision depends on the degree of importance of each decision maker so that wrong degree of importance causes the mistaken result. The researchers generally determine the degrees of importance of each decision maker according to special characteristics of each decision maker as subjectivity. In order to overcome this subjectivity in this paper, the judgments of decision makers are degraded to unique decision by using an attribute based aggregation technique. There is no study about software selection using integrated fuzzy AHP-fuzzy TOPSIS approach with group decision-making based on an attribute based aggregation technique. The results of the proposed approach and the other approaches are compared. Results indicate that our methodology allows decreasing the uncertainty and the information loss in group decision making and thus, ensures a robust solution to the firm.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is a package of business software that combines a number of modular software implementations to meet all the requirements of a firm. An ERP system is the knowledge framework of a firm that automates and combines whole business tasks like purchase, sales, inventory control, human resource, production planning and finance. Applications of ERP systems are one of the most important investment projects due to the difficulty, high cost and adaptation risks. Firms have spent billions of dollars and utilized many amounts of man-hours for installing detail ERP software systems [1]. Unprecedented market competition has impressed whole facets of business environment with the conclusion that firms need to decrease total costs, be more sensitive to customer requirements and reduce lead times. To overcome these challenges, novel software systems known in the business environment as ERP systems have surfaced in the market targeting primarily large scale organizations [2]. Any ERP software in market cannot fully meet the needs and expectations of companies, because every company runs its business with different strategies and goals. Thus, to increase the chance of success, management must choose an appropriate software that most closely suits its requirements [3]. Therefore, ERP software selection is an extremely serious and difficult decision making problem for managers. Many firms apply their ERP software hastily without exactly understanding the inclusions for requirements of their business strategies and goals. The conclusion of this hurry approach is the failure in ERP software selection that leads to the failure of project or firm performance will get weakened [4]. It is essential to select an appropriate software system for firms because of its difficult and expensive process. Clearly, software selection is not a well-defined or structured decision problem. The presence of multiple criteria (both managerial and technical) and the involvement of multiple decision makers will expand decisions from one to many several dimensions, thus, increasing the complexity of the selection process [5,6].This paper consists of six sections. The Section 2 presents the related literature review. The Section 3 introduces the integrated fuzzy extension of AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS approach in software selection problem (SSP). Section 4 is related with illustrative implementation of the developed decision making approach. The results of this paper are presented in Section 5. The concluding remarks that have been acquired are in the Section 6.Although the software selection has a remarkable significance, there are few studies that consider software selection methodologies in group decision making. Lai et al. [6] focused on the selection of multimedia authorizing systems by using AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). Lai et al. [7] recommended that AHP method was used to aid the selection of a multi-media authorizing system. Lee et al. [8] studied on SWOT based ERP software selection. Wei et al. [9] defined AHP model which enables a firm to determine the factors of ERP software selection. Mulebeke and Zheng [10] introduced a method, the AHP as multicriteria decision making technique to support the proper software selection to fit the product development process of a special product. Liao et al. [4] introduced a similarity degree based algorithm about ERP systems, which may be defined by various linguistic statements. A linear programming model is set up for deciding the most convenient ERP software. Ayağ and Ozdemir [3] adopted the fuzzy extension of the analytic network process (ANP) based intelligent approach to select the most convenient ERP software alternative. Sen et al. [11] proposed a novel decision support system for integrating the assessment of both non-functional and functional fitness to determine suitable ERP software. This methodology utilized a fuzzy multi criteria decision making process, a heuristic algorithm and a multi objective programming model to assess the best decision. All the stages of proposed methodology are performed in an electronic firm's ERP software evaluation project. Yazgan et al. [12] presented a new methodology for combining ANP and artificial neural network to determine the most appropriate ERP software. Karsak and Ozogul [2] suggested a comprehensive framework for the proper ERP selection among possible choices based on quality function deployment (QFD), fuzzy linear regression and zero-one goal programming. Ayağ [13] proposed the fuzzy AHP and simulation by integrating them in a computer-aided design SSP. Cebeci [14] recommended the fuzzy AHP and the fuzzy extension of AHP to compare ERP alternatives for a textile production firm. Sen and Baracli [15] adopted fuzzy QFD approach to select the best ERP software. Erdebilli and Erkan [16] and Méxas et al. [17] used the AHP in the ERP SSP. Méxas et al. [18] proposed AHP approach to investigate the opinions of information technology experts about the importance of ERP software evaluation criteria and sub-criteria in the construction industry. Asl et al. [19] proposed an integrated approach, which defines the most important criteria of ERP software using Delphi method and ranks these criteria using Shannon Entropy method. Gürbüz et al. [20] suggested an assessment framework using an integration approach that utilizes ANP, Choquet integral and Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique for the evaluation of four ERP software alternatives. Jafarnejad et al. [21] investigated an integrated approach which includes Shannon entropy technique, DEMATEL, and fuzzy AHP. Kara and Cheikhrouhou [5] determined a two phase methodology, fuzzy AHP for criteria weights and TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) for ranking the alternatives, to select the collaborative software.The decision makers have to define their preferences by using a set of numerical values. Each decision maker might have special goals, opinions, and different evaluation process, although they aim to select the best alternative. A number of decision makers interact to achieve unique decision in group decision making. The equal or unequal degrees of importance of all the decision makers are generally determined by researchers in group decision making according to special characteristics of each decision maker such experience, abilities, and knowledge. The final decision depends on the degree of importance of each decision maker significantly. Inaccurate degree of importance causes the mistaken selection and inherently waste of time and cost loss. We consider an attribute based aggregation technique presented by Olcer and Odabasi [22] in order to overcome this drawback.The final goal of fuzzy AHP is to acquire the weights of the criteria and rank the criteria accordingly. The relative weights are the output of the fuzzy AHP. However, some researchers often perceive the weights as potential input for other multi criteria decision making methods where integration with other methods could be established and applied in various knowledge domains [23].TOPSIS method is intuitive, easy to understand and implement in the form of software support tool, and is coherent with rational choices made by a human being [24]. PIS is defined that minimizes the cost criteria and maximizes the benefit criteria, but NIS minimizes the benefit criteria and maximizes the cost criteria. The farthest distance from negative ideal solution (NIS) and the shortest distance from positive ideal solution (PIS) are considered in TOPSIS approach simultaneously. Kara and Cheikhrouhou [5] used TOPSIS to select the collaborative software so that they considered crisp positive and negative ideal solutions. Real world multi criteria problems are usually not crisply defined because of the uncertainty of human judgments and therefore many various extensions and improvements of the classic TOPSIS method have been developed [24]. Fuzzy TOPSIS approach is preferred instead of the classical TOPSIS approach when the decision makers evaluate the alternative/criteria as linguistic variables. Crisp numbers cause information loss in uncertain environment. This paper presents the fuzzy TOPSIS approach in order to overcome this limitation in uncertain environment.There is no study about software selection using integrated fuzzy AHP-fuzzy TOPSIS approach with group decision making based on an attribute based aggregation technique. Fuzzy numbers are presented in all phases in order to overcome any vagueness in decision making process. This methodology allows decreasing the uncertainty and the information loss in group decision-making. This study purposes to ensure an analytical tool, which integrates fuzzy extension of AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS, to determine the most convenient software for an electronic firm. 15 criteria are clustered into four groups of factors, which are cost, technical specifications, vendor specifications and ease of use, according to the specialists’ opinions and the literature. Priority value of criteria in proposed methodology has been determined by employing fuzzy extension of AHP method because of little computation time and much simpler than other fuzzy AHP procedures. The solution of the recommended integrated approach for SSP has been found by employing an attribute based aggregation technique based fuzzy TOPSIS method. The results of TOPSIS methods based on distance and similarity measures are compared according to aggregating the fuzzy opinions with homogeneous and heterogeneous groups of decision makers. The selection problem is also analyzed with other hybrid methods, which are fuzzy AHP-fuzzy PROMETHEE (preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations) method, fuzzy AHP-fuzzy VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOm-promisno Resenje) method, fuzzy AHP-fuzzy ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité) method and fuzzy AHP-fuzzy GRA (grey relational analysis).In this paper, the recommended hybrid fuzzy extension of AHP-fuzzy TOPSIS methodology is employed to rank the software options. Firstly, we identified cost, technical specifications, vendor specifications and ease of use as the main criteria in an appropriate SSP through experts’ opinions and literature review. Cost criteria covers two sub-criteria like purchasing fee, updating fee, and technical specifications criteria covering five sub-criteria like interface, functionality, module framework, software reliability, supporting data files, and vendor specifications criteria covering three sub-criteria like training and consulting services, vendor's reputation, references, and ease of use criteria covering five sub-criteria like speed, learn ability, suitability for user, software ergonomics, reporting. Secondly, the priorities of criteria and sub-criteria in software selection will be determined by fuzzy extension of AHP. Pairwise comparison matrixes of specialists’ opinions are established to obtain criteria and sub-criteria priorities by employing the linguistic scale, which is demonstrated in Table 1.Unique decision of three specialists are acquired after opinions are degraded to only one value by using an attribute based aggregation technique so as to obtain requested results while establishing the hybrid approach for the software selection problem in fuzzy TOPSIS phase. Finally, ranking the alternatives in SSP will be defined by employing fuzzy TOPSIS that can consider both distance and similarity measures separately. The values of alternatives will be defined by using the scale in Table 2[25].AHP suggested by Saaty [26] is a method that constructs both qualitative and quantitative data in a multi criteria decision making problem hierarchically. Fuzzy extension of AHP method suggested by Chang [27] develops Saaty's AHP by integrating with fuzzy set theory to make a decision in uncertain environment. Fuzzy extension of AHP is proposed in this study because of little computation time and much simpler than other fuzzy AHP procedures. Fuzzy extension of AHP is employed to compute the weights of criteria and sub-criteria in a SSP systematically in a vague environment.Fuzzy extension of AHP method is shortly explained as in Eqs. (1)–(9)[27,28]:Two triangular fuzzy numbersM1(m1−,m1,m1+)andM2(m2−,m2,m2+)are demonstrated in Fig. 1[28].Whenm1−≥m2−,m1≥m2,m1+≥m2+The degree of the possibility is defined as one [29](1)V(M1≥M2)=1The ordinate of the highest intersection point is determined as [27–29]:(2)V(M2≥M1)=hgt(M1∩M2)=μ(d)=m1−−m2+(m2−m2+)−(m1−m1−)The value of the fuzzy synthetic extent can be determined as follows [27–29]:(3)Fi=∑j=1mMgij⊗∑i=1n∑j=1mMgij−1,i=1,2,…,n(4)∑j=1mMgij=∑j=1mmij−,∑j=1mmij,∑j=1mmij+,j=1,2,…,m(5)∑i=1n∑j=1mMgij−1=1∑i=1n∑j=1mMij+,1∑i=1n∑j=1mMij,1∑i=1n∑j=1mMij−(6)V(F≥F1,F2,…,Fk)=minV(F≥Fi),i=1,2,…,k(7)d(Fi)=minV(Fi≥Fk)=W′ik=1,2,…,nandk≠iThe weights of criteria are as follows after above procedure:(8)W′=(W′1,W′2,…,W′n)TBased on normalization, weights of criteria are:(9)W=(W1,W2,…,Wn)TThe consistency ratio of the pair-wise comparison matrix must be considered whether bigger or smaller than 0.1. Let be a triangular fuzzy numberX˜=(l,m,u).This fuzzy number can be defuzzied into a crisp value as Eq. (10)[30]:(10)P(X˜)=16(l+4×m+u)The relative importance can be obtained by the right eigenvector w corresponding to the largest eigenvector (λmax), in Eq. (11).(11)Aw=λmaxwThe weights can be achieved by normalizing any of the rows or columns of A. The consistency of pair-wise comparison matrix is determined by relation between the entries of A:aij×ajk=aik. The consistency index (CI) is calculated as shown in (12)[31].(12)CI=λmax−nn−1The consistency ratio (CR), which is the proportion of the random consistency index (RI) and the CI as shown in Eq. (13), presents whether the assessments are enough consistent. The upper level of CR is admitted as 0.1. When the CR exceeds this number, the assessment procedure must be reconsidered in order to improve consistency [31].(13)CR=CIRIRandom consistency index (RI) can be obtained from Table 3.The additive weighted aggregation (AWA) operator [32] in Eq. (14) can be used to calculate the overall weight in fuzzy extension of AHP phase.(14)gi=λk×gikIn the aggregation state of the suggested approach, the method presented in Chen [33] is employed for dealing with fuzzy opinion aggregation for homo/heterogeneous group of experts. One can accept that the each expert is not equally important so that it is called heterogeneous (non-homogeneous) group of experts in this case and, otherwise, homogeneous group of experts is considered. This algorithm essentially is a modification of the study proposed in Hsu and Chen [34,22]. The aim of this stage is to combine the opinions of homo/heterogeneous group of experts to obtain a group consensus opinion. All performance assessments are aggregated for criteria based each alternative after defining the weights of criteria and experts.Assume that the relative importance of each expert Ek(k=1,2, …,M)wek,wherewek∈0,1and∑k=1Mwek=1.If the relative importance of M experts are equal, then we1=we2= … =weM=1/M.The aggregation method for homo/heterogeneous groups of experts is calculated as follows [22]:Step 1: Determine the degree of similarity of Euexpert's opinions to Evexpert's opinions as in Eq. (15). Let U=(u1, u2, u3) and V=(v1, v2, v3) be two standardized triangular fuzzy numbers where 0≤u1≤u2≤u3≤1 and0≤v1≤v2≤v3≤1(15)S(U,V)=1−|u1−v1|+|u2−v2|+|u3−v3|3where S(U, V)∈[0, 1].Step 2: Define the agreement matrix (AM) in Eq. (16) after all the similarity degrees between each expert are calculated.(16)AM=1…Su1…SM1S12…Su2…SM2………S1v…Suv…SMv………S1M…SuM…1whereSuv=S(Ru,Rv),ifu≠vandSuv=1, if u=v.Step 3: Determine the average degree of similarity AA(Eu) in Eq. (17) by using the AM,(17)AA(Eu)=1M−1∑v=1,v≠uMS(Ru,Rv)Step 4: Determine the relative importance of agreement RA (Eu) of expert Eu(u=1,2, …,M) in Eq. (18).(18)RA(Eu)=AA(Eu)∑u=1MAA(Eu)Step 5: Determine the consensus degree coefficient CC(Eu) that indicates the relative importance of expert Eu(u=1,2, …,M) in Eq. (19),(19)CC(Eu)=βweu+(1−β)RA(Eu)whereβ0≤β≤1is a relaxation factor of the suggested method. When β=0, a homogeneous group of experts problem is considered.Step 6: Aggregate the fuzzy opinions in Eq. (20).(20)RAG=CC(E1)⊗R1⊕CC(E2)⊗R2⊕…⊕CC(EM)⊗RMTOPSIS suggested by Hwang and Yoon [35] is a method, which ranks suitable solutions are the farthest distance from negative ideal solution (NIS) and the shortest distance from positive ideal solution (PIS) simultaneously [35,36]. In the otherwise; alternative in the best level is as called PIS, alternative in the worst level is called as NIS. PIS is defined that minimizes the cost criteria and maximizes the benefit criteria, but NIS minimizes the benefit criteria and maximizes the cost criteria [37]. In the classical TOPSIS approach, individual judgments are described with certain values. However, evaluation by employing certain values is not always possible in real life problems. This important restriction of the TOPSIS approach is abolished by using a fuzzy set theory that includes a linguistic value instead of a certain value. The result of the fuzzy TOPSIS model can be used to define the most convenient alternative with regard to this firm's goals in ambiguity environment. In the literature, fuzzy TOPSIS is used in different areas in recent years such as facility location selection, machine-equipment selection and human resources selection. Application steps of fuzzy TOPSIS are as follows [25,38]:Step 1: Determining the fuzzy decision matrix(A˜): Fuzzy TOPSIS method deals with the points of quantitative and qualitative criteria using linguistic values. In shortly, decision makers can use linguistic values to define priority degrees of criteria based alternatives.A˜ijmatrix is a beginning matrix that the decision maker constructs and is indicated in Eq. (21):(21)A˜ij=a˜11a˜21⋮a˜m1a˜12a˜22⋮a˜m2……⋮…a˜1na˜2n⋮a˜mnm and n represent alternative number and evaluation criteria number inA˜ijmatrix, respectively. The elementsa˜ijof the matrix show the performance rating of the ith the alternative software according to jth software criteria.Step 2: Determining the normalized fuzzy decision matrix(R˜): The crude data in step 1 are normalized employing by using Eq. (22) to evaluate in the same scale [25].(22)r˜ij=a˜ij∑k=1makj2R˜ijmatrix is acquired as follows in Eq. (23)[25,38]:(23)R˜ij=r˜11r˜12...r˜1nr˜21r˜22...r˜2n⋮⋱⋯⋮r˜m1r˜m2⋯r˜mnwherer˜ij=aijcj+,bijcj+,cijcj+andcj+=maxicij(Benefitcriteria)r˜ij=aj−cij,aj−bij,aj−aijandaj−=miniaij(Costcriteria)Step 3: Determining the weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix(v˜): The weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix(v˜)for criteria is calculated in Eq. (24) by multiplying the weights (wi) of evaluation criteria with normalized fuzzy decision matrixr˜ij.(24)∑i=1nwi=1v˜ijmatrix is acquired as follows in Eq. (25)[25,38]:(25)v˜ij=w1r˜11w2r˜12...wnr˜1nw1r˜21w2r˜22...wnr˜2n......w1r˜m1w2r˜m2...wnr˜mni=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,nwherev˜ij=r˜ij(.)wjv˜ijis expressed by(a˜ijk,b˜ijk,c˜ijk).Step 4: Calculating the fuzzy positive ideal solution (FPIS) and fuzzy negative ideal solution (FNIS): The FPIS and FNIS of the alternatives are calculated as follows in Eqs. (26) and (27):(26)A+={v˜1+,v˜2+,…,v˜n+}wherev˜j+=(1,1,1)(27)A−={v˜1−,v˜2−,…,v˜n−}wherev˜j−=(0,0,0)Step 5: Determining the separation scales of each alternative: The distance(di+,di−)of each weighted alternative i=1,2, …,m from the FPIS and the FNIS is calculated as follows in Eqs. (28) and (29):(28)di+=∑j=1ndv(v˜ij,v˜j+),i=1,2,…,m(29)di−=∑j=1ndv(v˜ij,v˜j−),i=1,2,…,mIfv˜ij=(a˜ij,b˜ij,c˜ij)andv˜j+=(1,1,1)andv˜j−=(0,0,0):dv(v˜ij,v˜j+)=13(a˜ij−1)2+(b˜ij−1)2+(c˜ij−1)2,dv(v˜ij,v˜j−)=13(a˜ij−0)2+(b˜ij−0)2+(c˜ij−0)2.Step 6: Determining the closeness coefficient (CCi) of each alternative: The closeness coefficient CCishows the distances to the FPIS (A+) and the FNIS (A−) simultaneously in Eq. (30). The closeness coefficient of each alternative is computed as:(30)CCi=di−di−+di+Step 7: Rank the alternatives: The alternatives are ranked according to the CCiin decreasing order.Assume that two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers areA˜andB˜, whereA˜=(a1,a2,a3,a4;ωA˜),B˜=(b1,b2,b3,b4;ωB˜),(0≤a1≤a2≤a3≤a4≤1, 0≤b1≤b2≤b3≤b4≤1).ωA˜andωB˜are their corresponding heights and 1.0 according to decision makers. Fuzzy similarity measure betweenA˜andB˜is given as follows Eq. (31)[39]:(31)S(A˜,B˜)=1−∑i=14|ai−bi|4×min(P(A˜),P(B˜))+min(ωA˜,ωB˜)max(P(A˜),P(B˜))+max(ωA˜,ωB˜)whereP(A˜)andP(B˜)are the perimeters of theA˜andB˜trapezoidal fuzzy numbers respectively and are computed as follows Eqs. (32) and (33):(32)P(A˜)=(a1−a2)2+ωA˜2+(a3−a4)2+ωA˜2+(a3−a2)+(a4−a1)(33)P(B˜)=(b1−b2)2+ωB˜2+(b3−b4)2+ωB˜2+(b3−b2)+(b4−b1)The larger the value ofS(A˜,B˜), the more similarity between fuzzy numbersA˜andB˜.(34)Si+(v˜ij,v˜j+)=1−∑t=14|v˜ijt−v˜jt+|4×min(P(v˜ij),P(v˜j+))+min(ωv˜ij,ωv˜j+)max(P(v˜ij),P(v˜j+))+max(ωv˜ij,ωv˜j+)(35)Si−(v˜ij,v˜j−)=1−∑t=14|v˜ijt−v˜jt−|4×min(P(v˜ij),P(v˜j−))+min(ωv˜ij,ωv˜j−)max(P(v˜ij),P(v˜j−))+max(ωv˜ij,ωv˜j−)These formulations are used for trapezoidal fuzzy numbers so that we can transform to trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (0.0649, 0.1601, 0.1601, 0.2309) from triangular fuzzy numbers (0.0649, 0.1601, 0.2309). Instead ofdi+anddi−distance measurement that used in Eqs. (28) and (29),Si+(v˜ij,v˜j+)andSi−(v˜ij,v˜j−)in Eqs. (34) and (35) are used to calculate similarity measurements of FPIS and FNIS respectively in this phase [40].Closeness coefficient of each alternative software with respect to the similarity measurements (CCSi) in Eq. (36) is determined by using in Eqs. (34) and (35).(36)CCSi=Si+Si++Si−,i=1,2,…,mA real life application is analyzed in order to provide the better understanding of the proposed approach. This application is achieved in an electronic firm which produces electronic devices and is located in Turkey. Managers are planning to establish an ERP software system to their firms. However, they have some concerns about the most appropriate alternative. To evaluate the specified software alternatives, this study proposed a hybrid approach which presented in Section 2.Software selection process includes defining of expert decision makers to make selection, determining suitable software alternatives, determining criteria that examined in evaluation phases, weighting the criteria and evaluation of alternatives phases. An expert team of three decision makers D1, D2 and D3, which is composed of two software experts and one firm official, were asked to fill a questionnaire in order to define the most proper candidate. Fuzzy extension of AHP is employed to determine weights of four criteria and fifteen sub-criteria and then fuzzy TOPSIS is employed to rank four software alternatives based on criteria so software selection process is completed.In this study, software selection procedure begins to assign the three experts committee. Decision makers identify alternatives with considering fundamental criteria (cost, technical specifications, etc.) in alternative assessment process.ERP is an integrated business management software that includes all essential business tasks such as manufacturing, production planning, inventory management, marketing, payment, human resource. Firms ask ERP application for the aims of customer-order integration, standardization of production process, reduction of inventory level and order preparation time, standardization human resources information [41]. This problem comprises of four levels are goal, main criteria, sub-criteria and alternatives of decision process. These levels are showed in Fig. 2.Four main criteria and 15 sub-criteria that affecting software selection determined through literature review and concluded it by interviewing with the three experts committee. These main and sub criteria are as follows:Cost criteria are represented by C1.Purchasing fee: The price that a firm pays for acquisition software to a software firm (C11).Updating fee: It is necessary cost to get the top version of the software (C12).Vendor specifications criteria are symbolized by C2.Training and consultant services: The qualification and price of training are important factors if it is necessary except standard trainings (C21).Vendor's reputation: Vendor's reputation is one of important factors in defining the probability of long term contentment with a vendor. If everyone employing a product is commonly willing about it, you too will presumably be willing (C22).References: References of software supplied from firm in related sector is an important factor (C23).Technical specifications criteria are showed by C3.Interface: Software should be provided an interface, comprising of screen form, all functions, tool bars etc. provided by a computer to permit the user to contact and use the computer (C31).Functionality: Software can be designed to be made arrangements and to realize user requirements easily as a flexible construction (C32).Module framework: Software should comprise of units that are designed compatible with each other on a common platform (C33).Software reliability: Capability of a software to fulfill its aimed operations and functions in a system's environment, without experiencing disturbances (C34).Supporting data files: Data are provided to keep as files (C35).Ease of use criteria is expressed by C4.Software ergonomics: Software that has ergonomic and usability properties is a major factor with regard to the user firm (C41).Speed: Non-freezing screen and working of software speedy is a major factor for users (C42).Suitability for user: The expectations of the firm that will utilize the software may be satisfied (C43).Learnability: Usability of the software can be learned quickly and easily is essential by the user (C44).Reporting: The firm or the user, which can utilize the software, can easily be compiled the requested reports will increase the speed of access to information requested (C45).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This study has investigated a hybrid model is recommended for selection with fuzzy extension of AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS in an electronic firm's software selection problem that includes four alternatives. The initial three experts’ opinions and the literature review investigated the framework, which performed as the fundamental for modeling the suggested four criteria (cost, technical specifications, vendor specifications and ease of use) and 15 sub-criteria to assist software selection for firms of the electronic industry. Fuzzy extension of AHP is utilized to obtain the weights of criteria that considers in software selection because of little computation time and much simpler than other fuzzy AHP procedures, while fuzzy TOPSIS is used to rank the alternatives in terms of this firm's goals in uncertain environment. Fuzzy TOPSIS approach is preferred instead of the classical TOPSIS approach when the decision makers evaluate the alternative/criteria as linguistic variables. Crisp numbers cause information loss in uncertain environment. This paper presents the fuzzy TOPSIS approach in order to overcome this limitation in uncertain environment. The weights acquired from fuzzy extension of AHP are incorporated in fuzzy TOPSIS calculations and the four alternatives priorities are defined for selecting the most suitable software. The highest weights of criteria in software selection are determined purchasing fee, software reliability and references, respectively. The most suitable alternative is selected alternative 1.Multiple decision makers are generally preferred instead of only one decision maker in order to prevent the prejudice and reduce the siding in the decision making process. The equal or unequal degrees of importance of all the decision makers are generally determined by researchers in group decision making according to special characteristics of each decision maker such experience, abilities, and knowledge. The final decision depends on the degree of importance of each decision maker so that wrong degree of importance causes the mistaken result and inherently waste of time and cost loss. We considered an attribute based aggregation technique presented by Olcer and Odabasi [22] in order to overcome this drawback. Results present that the suggested hybrid approach ensures decreasing the information loss in group decision-making and thus, provides a robust solution to the firm.In the literature, advanced fuzzy sets such as Type 2 fuzzy sets [42,43], intuitionistic fuzzy sets [44,45] and hesitant fuzzy sets [46] were released. This study considered Type 1 fuzzy numbers in the field of MCDM. Type 2 fuzzy set, intuitionistic fuzzy set and hesitant fuzzy set are more complex than Type 1 fuzzy set. Namely, Type 1 fuzzy set is simpler than them so Type 1 fuzzy set is used in this study. Type 1 fuzzy numbers by using in this paper consider crisp membership degrees to express fuzzy numbers but interval type-2 fuzzy numbers handle more uncertainties than type-1 fuzzy numbers. Interval type 2 fuzzy numbers ensure us with additional information to describe the fuzziness and the uncertainty of the real life world. In future study, it is possible to focus on interval type 2 fuzzy MCDM methods to develop a decision support system for the most suitable software selection.
