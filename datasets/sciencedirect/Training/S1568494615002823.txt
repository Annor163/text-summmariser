@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, an application of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for the prediction of temperature distribution in a human brain equivalent liquid (BEL), resulting from exposure to electromagnetic radiation, is presented. In the first phase of the study, temperature distributions, resulting from different exposure conditions of electromagnetic (EM) fields, are experimentally determined. Since experimental determination of temperature distribution in each point of the BEL is time-consuming and hard to implement, ANFIS is employed to determine the distribution without new measurements. The use of ANFIS is found to be very useful in terms of the prediction of temperature distribution within the BEL after exposure to radiation. Numerical results show that the proposed method can be employed for the prediction of temperature distribution in a human BEL with high accuracy without requiring any experimental measurements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In recent years, much attention has been drawn on the possible effects of electromagnetic (EM) waves on human health [1–6]. Mobile phones differ from other EM sources with their rapidly increasing number and their proximity to the user's brain as a source of EM waves. Therefore, safety guidelines and regulations on production and use of mobile phones have been issued by international organizations [7–9].One of the most important effects caused by EM absorption is reported to be the temperature increase [10,11]. Another parameter, related to temperature increase and widely adopted in the literature is specific absorption rate (SAR). SAR is a measure of maximum energy absorbed by unit mass of tissue, which is exposed to EM field [5]. In simpler terms, the power absorbed by unit mass of tissue can be described as SAR. There is no comprehensive study available in the literature regarding the safety limits of the guidelines on the temperature rise in the brain as well as the increase in SAR values. Additionally, there is no clear report on adverse effects of EM fields, likely to occur in the long-term. On the other hand, the effects of temperature increase in biological tissues have been investigated in numerous studies. For instance, in [12] temperature increase in the hypothalamus is investigated and temperature rise in the brain is found to be within the range of 0.2–0.3°C, leading to altered thermoregulatory behavior. In [13], reduction of REM (rapid eye movement) stage and the changes in spectral power of the EEG during REM stage are reported. In [14], the relationship between headache and the use of mobile phones is reported. In another study, an increase of 4.5°C in the brain temperature is accepted as an allowable limit for exposures exceeding 30min. Various studies suggest that both foreseeable and unforeseeable health related issues are apt to occur with less significant increases in the brain temperature [4–6,15].
