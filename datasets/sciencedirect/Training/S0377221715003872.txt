@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a novel nonparametric methodology to evaluate convergence in an industry, considering a multi-input multi-output setting for the assessment of total factor productivity. In particular, we develop two new indexes to evaluate σ-convergence and β-convergence that can be computed using nonparametric techniques such as Data Envelopment Analysis. The methodology developed is particularly useful to enhance productivity assessments based on the Malmquist index. The methodology is applied to a real world context, consisting of a sample of Portuguese construction companies that operated in the sector between 2008 and 2010. The empirical results show that Portuguese companies tended to converge, both in the sense of σ and β, in all construction activity segments in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Convergence has been extensively discussed in the economic growth literature over the past decades (see Islam, 2003; Temple, 1999 for a literature review). The first studies devoted their attention to whether poor or low productive countries would catch up with their rich or highly productive counterparts. This is an issue of utmost importance for researchers and policymakers interested in worldwide welfare.Two main concepts of convergence appear in the classical literature (see Barro & Sala-i Martin, 1992). β-convergence analyzes if poor countries tend to grow faster than rich countries, whereas σ-convergence examines if the dispersion of the productivity for a group of countries tends to decrease over time. To measure these concepts, most studies use a single productivity measure, such as income per capita or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, or a measure of total factor productivity estimated using econometric methods. The evaluation of convergence in a multi-input multi-output setting has not been addressed in the literature.This research contributes to the literature by developing a nonparametric methodology for the evaluation of convergence in a multi-input multi-output setting, to enhance productivity assessments based on the Malmquist index. In particular, we explore the use of Shephard distance functions, estimated through Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), to calculate β-convergence and σ-convergence. In addition, this paper applies the two new indexes to evaluate convergence in a sample of Portuguese construction companies that operated in the sector between 2008 and 2010.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the new nonparametric indexes to evaluate σ-convergence and β-convergence, and explains their computation using DEA. Section 3 presents the empirical application, including the motivation, the description of the data set and the discussion of the results. The last section concludes and points topics for future research.The concept of σ-convergence can be explained as follows: “a group of economies are converging in the sense of σ if the dispersion of the their real per capita GDP levels tends to decrease over time” (Sala-i Martin, 1996). The notion of σ-convergence can be expressed, in mathematical terms, as shown in expression (1).(1)σt+1<σtσtis the standard deviation of the logarithm of the real per capita GDP levels across all economies in period t, whereas σt + 1 is a similar measure in a subsequent period. This definition can be extended to a more general setting, consisting of the assessment of Decision Making Units (DMUs) (e.g., representing countries or organizations), where σ-convergence explores whether the dispersion of values of a productivity indicator, measured as an output to input ratio, tends to decrease (or increase) over time.Our aim is to generalize the measurement of convergence to a multi-input multi-output setting, and thus we explore σ-convergence using the Shephard distance function. The Shephard distance function is a generalization of the production function that allows us to consider simultaneously multiple inputs and outputs. As this paper is devoted to output oriented assessments, all indexes and measures described have an output orientation.Consider n DMUs in time period t that use inputsxt∈R+mto produce outputsyt∈R+s,and in a subsequent time period t + 1 use inputsxt+1∈R+mto produce outputsyt+1∈R+s. In period t, the production technology Ttconsists of the set of all feasible input/output combinations for a certain production process, as shown in (2).(2)Tt={(xt,yt):xtcanproduceyt}Following Shepard (1970), the output distance function for DMU join relation to the technology Ttis defined as shown in (3).(3)Dt(xt,yt)=min{θ:(xt,ytθ)∈Tt}This function is defined as the reciprocal to the maximum proportional expansion of the output vector yt, given inputs xt, i.e., Dt(xt, yt) ≤ 1. This means that it corresponds to the efficiency score of DMU jo, in the sense of Farrell (1957). Thus, in order to estimate σ-convergence we can use efficiency measures. In other words, the spread of productivity levels can be estimated using the spread of efficiency measures. Efficiency is a relative measure that compares the productivity of a DMU jowith the best productivity levels of the sample. Therefore, a sample with larger dispersion of productivity levels will also have larger dispersion of efficiency. Fare, Grosskopf, Lindgren, and Roos (1992) were the first to note that input and output distance functions could be estimated using DEA models (Charnes, Cooper, & Rhodes, 1978).For a given DMU jo, the ratio between the efficiency score in period t + 1 and in t, as presented in (4) is a measure of convergence towards the best practice frontier (see Fare, Grosskopf, Norris, & Zhang, 1994). This implies that there is convergence to the frontier if efficiency increases from period t to t + 1. Note that this ratio corresponds to the Efficiency Change (ECt,t+1) component of the Malmquist index proposed by Fare et al. (1992).(4)Dt+1(xt+1,yt+1)Dt(xt,yt)=ECt,t+1To determine σ-convergence in an industry, we propose calculating the geometric mean of expression (4) for all DMUs in the sample, as shown in (5). To distinguish our measure of σ-convergence, defined using Shephard distance functions and calculated using DEA models, from the traditional σ-convergence measure (see expression 1), we refer to it asσ^-convergence hereafter.(5)σ^-convergence=(∏j=1nECjt,t+1)1/nTheσ^-convergence index may be greater, equal or smaller than one. Aσ^-convergence index greater than one indicates convergence (i.e. the DMUs moved closer to the best practice frontier from period t to t + 1), whereas a score less than one means divergence (i.e. the DMUs moved away from the best practice frontier between t to t + 1). A score equal to one indicates that, on average, the DMUs are located at a similar distance to the frontier in period t and t + 1.The advantage of usingσ^-convergence over the traditional measure of σ-convergence is that it allows accounting for multiple inputs and multiple outputs, as it can be estimated using nonparametric techniques such as DEA.The basic ideas behind the calculation of theσ^-convergence can be illustrated in Fig. 1. This figure presents 10 DMUs (e.g., countries), whose activity is represented by an output (e.g., GDP) and an input (e.g., population) in two time periods. The ratio y/x represents a productivity measure. The best practice frontiers (BF) at time periods t + 1 and t are also plotted in Fig. 1.Consider DMU H, represented by point Htin time period t and point Ht + 1 in time period t + 1. In the example, the efficiency score of DMU H in period t measured in relation to the best practice in t, corresponds to the ratio oHt/oa. The efficiency score of DMU H in period t + 1, measured in relation to the best practice frontier in period t + 1, corresponds to the ratio o′Ht + 1/o′d. Hence, the change in efficiency between period t and t + 1 is measured as shown in expression (6).(6)ECt,t+1=o′Ht+1/o′doHt/oaThe value ofECt,t+1for DMU H is greater than one (i.e., 1.09), as DMU H is closer to the best practice frontier in t + 1 than in t. This indicates convergence towards the best practice frontier.Table 1presents the original data set used in Fig. 1, the output distance function and the productivity for each DMU in each time period. Recall that in a single input-output setting, the efficiency measure is the ratio between the observed productivity of DMU joand the maximum productivity observed in other DMUs in the same time period. Thus, if maximum productivity is equal to one (i.e, the maximum ratio of output to input is one), the two measures would coincide. In the example shown in Table 1, the maximum productivity in period t was observed in DMU C, whose output to input ratio is equal to one, and thus productivity and efficiency coincide (see fourth and fifth columns of Table 1). Furthermore, if the maximum productivity remains equal to one in periods t and t + 1 (i.e., the technology does not change between period t and t + 1), the output distance functions (or efficiency scores) and the productivity ratios would be identical in the two periods.In this illustrative example, using expression (5), the value ofσ^-convergence is 1.22, which indicates convergence between period t and t + 1. Using expression (1) the standard deviation of the log of productivity in period t + 1 is equal to 0.07, and the standard deviation of the log of the productivity in period t is equal to 0.18. So, both measures indicate the occurrence of convergence between period t and t + 1.Note that the existence ofσ^-convergence can be confirmed with a visual inspection of Fig. 1, as our illustrative example consists of a single input and a single output. For a multi-input multi-output setting, a possible way to visualize the existence of convergence is to use kernel densities that represent the values of the distance functions (or efficiency scores) of the sample (see Fare, Grosskopf, & Margaritis, 2006; Jamasb, Pollitt, & Triebs, 2008). The narrowing of these curves over time or their skewness towards the maximum efficiency score (i.e., one) signals convergence. Fig. 2exhibits the kernel density estimates of the distance functions for time period t and t + 1. Following Simar and Zelenyuk (2006), we use Gaussian kernel function and Silverman (1986) rule of thumb to determine the bandwidth. From Fig. 2, we can observe that the distribution of the distance function narrowed and the mode of the distribution moved towards higher levels in time period t + 1, which provides visual evidence of convergence.The concept of β-convergence can be explained as follows: “there is absolute β convergence if poor economies tend to grow faster than rich ones” (Sala-i Martin, 1996). Suppose we have data on real per capita GDP for a sample of economies. Let log(yt/xt) be the logarithm of an economy’s GDP per capita at time t, and γt, t + 1 be the economy’s growth rate of GDP between t and t + 1, measured aslog((yt+1/xt+1)/(yt/xt)). β-convergence can be estimated using regression as shown in expression (7).(7)γt,t+1=α+βlog(yt/xt)+ɛIf β < 0, we say that the data set exhibits β-convergence, meaning that countries with high levels of per capita GDP in t exhibit smaller growth rates of per capita GDP.To evaluate β-convergence, we need to analyze the movements of the DMUs located on the best practice frontier (rich countries) and also the movements of the DMUs located on the worst practice frontier (poor countries) between periods t and t + 1. In this sense, there is β-convergence if the distance between the frontiers of richer countries and poor countries is smaller in t + 1 than in t.The process of convergence between period t and t + 1 may occur due to the decline of the best practice frontier whilst the worst practice frontier improves, remains unchanged or declines at a smaller rate. It may also be associated to the improvement of the worst practice frontier whilst the best practice frontier declines, remains unchanged or improves at a smaller rate. The process of divergence between period t and t + 1 follows a similar rationale, i.e., the best practice frontier improves whilst the worst practice frontier improves less than the best practice frontier, remains unchanged, or regresses, or the worst practice frontier declines whilst the best practice frontier declines less than the worst practice frontier, remains unchanged or improves. There is no evidence of convergence or divergence when the distance between the frontiers remains unchanged over time, i.e., the frontiers improve or decline at the same rate, or keep unchanged.In a single input–output setting, the distance between the best and worst frontiers (DBW) in periods t and t + 1 can be measured, for a given DMU jousing expression (8) or (9). Expressions (8) and (9) measure the change in distance between the two frontiers, evaluated for the input–output mix of DMU jo, in period t and in t + 1, respectively.(8)DBWt=Dt(xt,yt)Wt(xt,yt)Dt+1(xt,yt)Wt+1(xt,yt)(9)DBWt+1=Dt(xt+1,yt+1)Wt(xt+1,yt+1)Dt+1(xt+1,yt+1)Wt+1(xt+1,yt+1)Wt(xt, yt) corresponds to the reciprocal to the maximum proportional reduction of the output vector yt, given inputs xt, required to reach the minimum productivity level observed in the sample in period t, whilst Dt(xt, yt) is the reciprocal to the maximum proportional expansion of the output vector yt, given inputs xt, to reach the maximum productivity level. Note that Wt(xt, yt) ≥ 1, with 1 meaning that the DMU is located on the worst practice frontier, whilst Dt(xt, yt) ≤ 1, with 1 meaning that the DMU is located on the best practice frontier.In a single input–output setting, the values of expressions (8) and (9) are identical for all DMUs. However, in a multi input–output setting, the distance between the best and worst frontiers in periods t and t + 1 can be different. Thus, for a given DMU jo, the change in distance between the best and worst frontiers(DBWt,t+1)can be measured as the geometric mean of the change in distance between the two frontiers evaluated at t (xt, yt) and at t + 1 (xt + 1, yt + 1 as follows:(10)DBWt,t+1=(Dt(xt,yt)Wt(xt,yt)×Dt(xt+1,yt+1)Wt(xt+1,yt+1))1/2(Dt+1(xt,yt)Wt+1(xt,yt)×Dt+1(xt+1,yt+1)Wt+1(xt+1,yt+1))1/2Note that expression (10) can be rearranged as shown in (11), such that the numerator becomes the Technological Change (TCt,t+1) component of the Malmquist index proposed by Fare et al. (1992). Thus, the numerator measures the distance between the best practice frontiers in t and t + 1. Similarly, the denominator measures the distance between the worst practice frontiers (or the lowest productivity levels observed in the sample) in t and t + 1. Hereafter, we call this measure Worst Practice Change (WPCt,t+1), as it is computed in relation to the worst practice frontier.(11)DBWt,t+1=(Dt(xt,yt)Dt+1(xt,yt)×Dt(xt+1,yt+1)Dt+1(xt+1,yt+1))1/2(Wt(xt,yt)Wt+1(xt,yt)×Wt(xt+1,yt+1)Wt+1(xt+1,yt+1))1/2=TCt,t+1WPCt,t+1To determine the β-convergence index in an industry, we propose calculating the geometric mean of expression (11) for all DMUs in the sample, as shown in (12). To distinguish our measure of β-convergence from the traditional β-convergence measure, we refer it asβ^-convergence hereafter.(12)β^-convergence=(∏j=1nTCjt,t+1WPCjt,t+1)1/nTheβ^-convergence index may be greater, equal or smaller than one. Aβ^-convergence index greater than one indicates that the worst and the best practice frontiers are more distant in time period t + 1 than in period t (i.e., divergence occurs between periods t and t + 1). Aβ^-convergence index smaller than one indicates that both frontiers are closer in period t + 1 than in period t (i.e., convergence occurs between periods t and t + 1). A score equal to one means that both frontiers are located at a similar distance in periods t + 1 and t.Theβ^-convergence extends the traditional method for the estimation of β-convergence in two ways. First, it is applicable to multi-input multi-output settings. Second, it can be decomposed into two components as presented in expression (13). The Average Technological Change (ATCt, t + 1) and the Average Worst Practice Change (AWPCt, t + 1), corresponding to the numerator and denominator of expression (13), which characterize the average movements of the best practice frontiers and worst practice frontiers, respectively, between period t and t + 1.(13)β^-convergence=(∏j=1nTCjt,t+1)1/n(∏j=1nWPCjt,t+1)1/n=ATCt,t+1AWPCt,t+1The basic ideas behind the calculation of theβ^-convergence are illustrated in Fig. 3. This figure represents the 10 DMUs presented in Table 1, and illustrates the best practice frontier (BF) and the worst practice frontier (WF) at time periods t and t + 1.In the case of DMU H, considering its position in t (Ht), the distance between the best practice frontier and the worst practice frontier in period t + 1 is measured by ob/obW, whereas the distance between frontiers in period t is oa/oaW. Thus, the change in distance between the two frontiers in periods t and t + 1 is given by the ratio of ob/obWto oa/oaW. Similarly, considering the position of DMU H in period t + 1 (Ht + 1), the change in distance between the two frontiers in periods t and t + 1 is given by the ratio of o′d/o′dWto o′c/o′cW. The geometric mean of these two ratios, corresponding to expression (10), defines the change in distance between the two frontiers in periods t and t + 1 for DMU H as follows.(14)DBWt,t+1=(ob/obWoa/oaW×o′d/o′dWo′c/o′cW)1/2The value ofDBWt,t+1for DMU H is less than one (i.e., 0.43), as the distance between the best and worst practice frontiers diminished from t to t + 1. As the illustrative example consists of a single input–output, the value ofDBWt,t+1is equal for all DMUs in the sample, and so the value ofβ^-convergence is also equal toDBWt,t+1.Table 2shows the values ofDBWt,t+1,TCt,t+1,andWPCt,t+1for each DMU in the sample. In this example,β^-convergence is equal to 0.43, which means convergence occurred between t and t + 1 (i.e., the distance between the best and worst frontiers reduced from t to t + 1). Using the traditional method for the estimation of β-convergence, shown in expression (7), we obtain a β-convergence value equal to -1.15, which also indicates convergence between t and t + 1. The values of ATCt, t + 1 and AWPCt, t + 1 are 1.5 and 3.5, respectively. This means that both the best and worst practice frontiers improved productivity between t and t + 1 (i.e., both components ofβ^-convergence are greater than one). However, the worst practice frontier improved more than the best practice frontier, as the value of AWPCt, t + 1 is greater than the value of ATCt, t + 1.To illustrate further the information that can be obtained by analyzing the components ofβ^-convergence, we use three cases of divergence, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The insights obtained exploring the components ofβ^-convergence would not be available using the traditional regression approach to estimate β-convergence.In the three cases presented in Fig. 4,β^-convergence is greater than one, meaning that divergence occurred between the best and worst observed productivity levels in t and t + 1. In particular, in case a, the best practice frontier improved between t and t + 1 (ATCt, t + 1 > 1), whereas the worst practice frontier declined between t and t + 1 (AWPCt, t + 1 < 1). In case b, both the best practice and worst practice frontiers improved between t and t + 1, but the worst practice frontier improved less than the best practice frontier (ATCt, t + 1 > 1 and AWPCt, t + 1 > 1, with AWPCt, t + 1 < ATCt, t + 1). In case c, both the best practice and worst practice frontiers declined between t and t + 1, but the worst practice frontier declined more than the best practice frontier (ATCt, t + 1 < 1 and AWPCt, t + 1 < 1, with AWPCt, t + 1 > ATCt, t + 1).The standard DEA model, proposed by Charnes et al. (1978), can be used to estimate the distances in relation to the best practice frontier. The distances measured in relation to the worst practice frontier embodied in theβ^-convergence index can be obtained using the inverted DEA model, first proposed by Yamada, Matsui, and Sugiyama (1994). This model consists of swapping the inputs and the outputs of the standard DEA model. The inverted DEA model was previously used in the literature in other contexts different from the purpose of this paper. For instance, it was proposed to estimate intervals for efficiency scores (Entani, Maeda, & Tanaka, 2002), to detect outliers (Johnson & McGinnis, 2008), to evaluate credit risk (Paradi, Asmild, & Simak, 2004), to support the design of financial investment strategies (Kadoya, Kuroko, & Namatame, 2008), or to construct a lower frontier to delimitate a contract zone (Hadley & Ruggiero, 2006).The standard DEA model and the inverted DEA model (as presented in Entani et al. (2002)) used to computeσ^-convergence andβ^-convergence are shown in (15) and (16), respectively. Both are specified with an output orientation, seeking adjustments to output levels, and assume constant returns to scale.(15)[Dt(xt,yt)]−1=min∑i=1mvixijosubjectto∑r=1suryrjo=1∑r=1suryrj−∑i=1mvixij≤0,j=1,⋯,nvi≥0,i=1,⋯,mur≥0,r=1,⋯,s(16)[Wt(xt,yt)]−1=max∑i=1mvixijosubjectto∑r=1suryrjo=1∑i=1mvixij−∑r=1suryrj≤0,j=1,⋯,nvi≥0,i=1,⋯,mur≥0,r=1,⋯,sThe variables of models (15) and (16) are urand vi, corresponding to the weights associated to the outputs yrj(r = 1,…, s) and inputs xij(i = 1,…, m), respectively. The objective function of model (15) is greater or equal to one, where one indicates that the DMU is located on the frontier. The objective function of model (16) returns a value smaller or equal to one, such that a value equal to one indicates that the DMU is located on the worst practice frontier.The construction industry (CI) is a major sector in Europe. According to the European Construction Industry Federation (FIEC, 2010), the construction sector accounted for 10.4 percent of European Gross Domestic Product and 7.2 percent of Europe’s total employment in 2008. The CI plays a crucial role in the economy and society, as it provides the infrastructure and housing that supports other economic activities.The European CI has been witnessing considerable changes in the last years. Since the 1990’s, European construction activity has experienced a positive development. This was mainly boosted by the introduction of the euro currency that implied low interest rates, and by the large scale subsidies for infrastructure projects. However, the growth trend in the European CI started to invert in 2008. Europe was hit by a financial crisis that severely impacted the CI activity. The crisis affected most European countries and subsectors of the CI activity. In particular, the residential segment that constituted the largest market for the CI was strongly hit by the credit constraints and the lack of consumer confidence, which postponed investment in property. The civil engineering segment was less affected by the crisis due to national economic recovery plans that prioritized infrastructure projects. Concerning the effects of the crisis in the European countries, Eastern countries (e.g. Poland, Romania, Bulgaria) were the least affected by the economic downturn, whereas the construction activity in Western countries (e.g. Portugal, Spain, France) has dramatically dropped.To overcome the financial crisis in the European CI, the European Construction Industry Federation and the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers (FIEC & EFBWW, 2009) proposed the following measures: (i) to increase the public investment in infrastructure projects and sustainable construction, (ii) to provide incentives for buying and renovating houses, (iii) to facilitate the access to mortgages, (iv) to provide incentives for “social housing”, (v) to ensure the efficient use of investment resources, (vi) to apply temporary unemployment schemes, (vii) to create a more sustainable and transparent financial system. The urgency of implementing such measures at European and national levels was recently recalled (FIEC & EFBWW, 2010).To survive and prosper in this adverse context, construction companies need robust methods to evaluate performance for a timely realignment of strategies and procedures. The development of robust methods to provide enhanced knowledge of the construction sector is even more relevant in periods of economic recession, as companies are more prone to bankruptcy. These arguments, in conjunction with the scarce literature on CI performance assessment, have motivated an empirical application devoted to the characterization of the evolution of the CI in the aftermath of the financial crisis in Portugal. This study is the first to evaluate convergence in the context of the construction industry. Previous research on the Portuguese CI primarily focused on the evaluation of construction companies’ performance using data from internet benchmarking platforms (Horta, Camanho, & Costa, 2010) and on the assessment of innovation within the sector (Horta, Camanho, & Costa, 2012).The data set used to illustrate the methodology developed consists of a balanced panel data of 8308 Portuguese construction companies that operated in the sector between 2008 and 2010. This corresponds to a total of 16,616 observations in the two years analyzed. In order to create groups of similar construction companies, the analysis was done by splitting companies into the four major CI activity segments: buildings (5667 companies), road networks and related infrastructure (807 companies), hydraulic works (153 companies), and mechanical & electrical facilities (1681 companies).Before defining the data set, we applied an outlier detection procedure. In particular, an observation was considered an outlier when the ratio output to any of the three inputs was outside the interval of the median plus and minus two standard deviations (e.g., see Kapelko, Oude Lansink, and Stefanou, 2014). The data set concerns companies that comply with the minimum obligatory requirements to operate in the sector in the period analyzed (i.e., at least 100 percent on liquidity and 5 percent on financial autonomy). The data used came from the regulatory board of Portuguese Construction and Real Estate (INCI), through the icBench project (for further details on this project, see Costa, Horta, Guimaraes, Novoa, Cunha, and Sousa, 2007).To evaluate the convergence of the Portuguese construction companies, the inputs and outputs of the production process need to be specified. According to previous studies carried out on CI performance (Horta, Camanho, Johnes, & Johnes, 2013; Pilateris & McCabe, 2003; You & Zi, 2007), as well as in other industries (Delen, Kuzey, & Uyar, 2013; Johnes & Johnes, 2013), we selected one output and three inputs to represent key financial measures of companies: liquidity, leverage, profitability and cost accounting. The output concerns the value of sales, which represents a profitability measure. The inputs are: total current liabilities (that measure the amount due to creditors and suppliers) to proxy liquidity, shareholders’ funds (that measure the shareholders’ participation in the company) to proxy leverage, and operating costs (which include the fixed and the variable costs of production) to proxy cost accounting. The selection of variables was constrained by data availability. As the inputs and outputs are measured in monetary terms, our measure of productivity reflects economic aspects of company’s activity. Table 3 reports the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the variables used in the assessment of the CI activity sectors for the period 2008 and 2010.From Table 3, it is possible to observe that the companies analyzed within each activity sector are relatively diverse, given the large values of the standard deviation. The companies in the hydraulic segment exhibited the largest values in all variables.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper presents a novel nonparametric methodology to evaluate convergence considering a multi-input multi-output context for the evaluation of total factor productivity. This methodology is particularly relevant to complement productivity assessments using the Malmquist index. In particular, we develop two new indexes to evaluate σ-convergence and β-convergence that can be estimated using nonparametric techniques such as DEA. The major advantage of using ourσ^-convergence andβ^-convergence indexes over traditional approaches is that they allow evaluations using multi-inputs and multi-outputs, which typically characterize the activity of DMUs in a real world context. In addition, ourβ^-convergence index can be decomposed into two components that provide insights on the sources ofβ^-convergence.The methodology developed was applied to a real world context by evaluating panel data consisting of 8308 Portuguese construction companies between 2008 and 2010. The analysis was done separating construction companies into four main activity profiles (buildings, road networks and related infrastructure, hydraulic works, and mechanical & electrical facilities). The empirical results showed that Portuguese construction companies tended to converge in the sense ofσ^andβ^in all activity sectors in the aftermath of the financial crisis.The information concerning the status of the CI sector at a national level is important for company managers and also administrative authorities. The detailed knowledge of the market and its evolution over time is essential for defining industry strategies and policies, as they can support decisions concerning investments, subcontracting practices, mergers and acquisitions, and partnerships.For future research, it would be of interest to develop other measures of convergence, such as a nonparametric conditional β-convergence. This measure would enable the evaluation of convergence in a sample of DMUs with different characteristics. It would also be interesting to develop enhanced convergence indexes that can account for slacks, or to complement the indexes using the bootstrapping technique to test the significance of the results obtained. In addition, the methodology developed could be applied to other activity sectors (e.g. manufacturing or mining) to enable cross industry comparisons, or to other countries or worldwide regions to undertake international benchmarking exercises.
