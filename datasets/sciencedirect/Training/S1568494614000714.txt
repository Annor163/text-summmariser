@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In real projects, the trade-off between the project cost and the project completion time, and the environmental uncertainty are aspects of considerable importance for managers. For complex environment with more than one type of uncertainty, this paper presents three types of time–cost trade-off models, in which the project environment is described via introducing the fuzzy random theory. The expected value and the chance measure of fuzzy random variable are introduced for modeling the problem under different decision-making criteria. After that, this paper is devoted to designing a searching method integrating the technique of fuzzy random simulations and genetic algorithm for searching the quasi-optimal schedules. Finally, some numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed method for solving the proposed models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The time–cost trade-off problem studies how to modify project activities so as to achieve the trade-off between the completion time and the project cost, which is a specific type of the project scheduling problem. Kelley [1] first studied the problem. In the following years, the research on the time–cost trade-off problem most focused on the deterministic cases [2–4]. For solving the deterministic time–cost trade-off problem, the common analytical methods are linear programming and dynamic programming [5,6]. Besides, some heuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA) [7,8], are also introduced.Though much research work on the time–cost trade-off problem assumes the problem in deterministic environment, the real world is full of nondeterministic factors. For instance, the project completion time may vary for many external factors, such as the change of weather, the increase of productivity level and the use of additional manpower. Hence, much recent work introduced uncertain factors. The readers may refer to papers [9–11] to see the progress in stochastic project scheduling problem. In recent years, stochastic time–cost trade-off problem has also attracted much interest. Wollmer [12] discussed a stochastic linear time–cost trade-off problem, in which some discrete random variables were introduced. Gutjahr et al. [13] designed a modified stochastic branch-and-bound approach and applied it into a specific stochastic discrete time–cost trade-off problem. Laslo [14] described a stochastic critical-path-method time–cost trade-off model, including four fundamental formulations of the model and several new ideas for formulating the relationships between time–cost trade-offs. Zheng and Ng [15] presented a new approach for time–cost optimization model by integrating fuzzy set theory and nonreplaceable front with genetic algorithms, where fuzzy set theory was introduced to model the managers’ prediction on activity times and costs as well as the associated risk levels. Zahraie and Tavakolan [16] embedded two concepts of time–cost trade-off and resource leveling and allocation in a stochastic multiobjective optimization model, where fuzzy set theory was applied to represent different options for each activity. Ke et al. [17] presented three stochastic time–cost trade-off models to meet different practical optimization requirements.Sometimes the uncertainty in projects cannot be described by randomness. In fact, the activities of some projects may have been processed many times before, and with historical data, the uncertainty of activity duration time can be described by probability distributions. While the activities of some other projects may be short of statistical data, the duration times can be better described by fuzzy variables. With the development of the research on fuzziness, the fuzzy set theory was also applied into the project scheduling problem, originally by Prade [18]. To the best of our knowledge of the authors, the first work on the fuzzy time–cost trade-off problem was done by Leu et al. [19]. In Ref. [19], the activity durations were characterized by fuzzy numbers due to environmental variation, and the fuzzy relationship between the activity time and the activity cost was demonstrated by membership function. Furthermore, the philosophy of chance-constrained programming was introduced as the decision-making criterion. Jin et al. [20] gave a GA-based fully fuzzy optimal time–cost trade-off model, in which all parameters and variables were characterized by fuzzy numbers and an example in ship building scheduling was demonstrated. Eshtehardian et al. [21] built a multi-objective fuzzy time–cost model, in which fuzzy logic theory was introduced to represent accepted risk levels. Ghazanfari et al. [22] and Ghazanfari et al. [23] applied possibilistic goal programming to the time–cost trade-off problem to determine optimal duration for each activity in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers. Ke et al. [24] introduced credibility theory into this optimization problem and built three types of fuzzy models. Chen and Tsai [25] constructed membership function of fuzzy minimum total crash cost based on Zadeh's extension principle and transformed the time–cost trade-off problem to a pair of parametric mathematical programs.Sometimes randomness and fuzziness may exist in the same real project. For instance, Ke and Liu [26] introduced the philosophy of random fuzzy programming into the project scheduling problem. For the complicated environment with randomness and fuzziness, fuzzy random programming is also a very powerful tool for solving time–cost trade-off problem. Fuzzy random variable was first introduced by Kwakernaak [27,28]. In this paper, we introduce the concept of fuzzy random variable initialized by Liu and Liu [29] for modeling time–cost trade-off problem in complicated uncertain environment. Three time–cost trade-off models are built, including the (α, β)-cost minimization model, the expected cost minimization model and the chance maximization model. A hybrid intelligent algorithm integrating fuzzy random simulation and GA is designed for solving the models.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the fuzzy random time–cost trade-off problem is described, and the formulae of the project completion time and the project cost are deduced. In Section 3, based on some introduced concepts, three fuzzy random time–cost trade-off models are built. The degeneration of the models is also discussed in Section 3. For solving the established models, three types of fuzzy random simulations are designed and integrated with GA for designing a hybrid intelligent algorithm in Section 4. The following section illustrates the effectiveness of the hybrid intelligent algorithm by some numerical experiments. Finally, Section 6 draws some conclusions.For environmental or decision-making changes, the activity durations might vary, and meanwhile the activity costs also change correspondingly. For instance, hiring more workers might accelerate the project scheduling process to consequently save the project completion time and simultaneously increase the total project cost. Actually, in most real projects, the managers always need to take into account the trade-off between the total project cost and the project completion time. It is naturally desirable for the managers to find the most effective way to complete a project in some predetermined completion time limit and meanwhile with the ‘minimal’ cost in some sense.Generally with the activity-on-arrow(AOA) network structure, a project can be described by a directed acyclic graph as illustrated in Fig. 1. Let G=(V, A) be a directed acyclic graph representing a project, where V={1, 2, …, n} is the set of nodes, A is the set of arcs representing the activities of the project.First we introduce the parameter ξijas a fuzzy random variable representing the normal duration time of activity (i, j) in A, whose uncertainty attributes to the variation of the external environment, and cijas the normal cost per day of activity (i, j), which is a constant. That is, ξijrepresents the duration time of activity (i, j) without the decision-making influence. The fuzzy random normal activity duration times are concisely written asξ={ξij:(i, j)∈A}. The decision variable xij, assumed to be an integer, represents the duration time change of activity (i, j) due to some manager decision-makings, such as hiring more or less workers, applying better or worse instruments, etc. To some extent, the concept is like the difference between normal duration time and crash duration time in project management. Owing to some practical limits, the variable xijis bounded by some interval [lij, uij], where lijand uijare assumed to be integers. Accordingly for each activity (i, j), the extra cost dij, also assumed to be a constant, is defined as the cost change caused by the unit change of xij. With the project completion time requirement, it is necessary for the manager to find the optimal decision vectorx={xij:(i, j)∈A} to minimize the project cost.We denote Tij(x,ξ) as the starting time of activity (i, j) and the starting time of activity (1, j)∈A is defined as T1j(x,ξ)=0. For simplicity, each activity is assumed to be processed only once all the foregoing activities are finished according to the precedence relationship type of finish-to-start linkage, and should be processed without interruption. With these assumptions, the starting time of activity (i, j), i=2, 3, …, n−1, can be determined byTij(x,ξ)=max(k,i)∈A{Tki(x,ξ)+ξki+xki}.With the iterative consequence, the project completion time can be calculated by(1)T(x,ξ)=max(k,n)∈A{Tkn(x,ξ)+ξkn+xkn}.The project cost can be obtained by(2)C(x,ξ)=∑(i,j)∈A(cijξij−dijxij).In this subsection, we will give some concepts of credibility theory and fuzzy random theory. The interested reader may refer to Liu [30] to see more of credibility theory and fuzzy random theory. For recalling the concept of fuzzy random variable, we first introduce the concept of fuzzy variable. Let Θ be a nonempty set, andPthe power set of Θ.Definition 1(Liu and Liu [31]) The set function Cr is called a credibility measure if it satisfies:(i) Cr{Θ}=1. (ii) Cr{A}≤Cr{B} whenever A⊂B. (iii) Cr{A}+Cr{Ac}=1 for anyA∈P. (iv)Cr{∪iAi}=supiCr{Ai}for any {Ai} withsupiCr{Ai}<0.5.Next, we will introduce the concept of credibility space for helping define a fuzzy variable.Definition 2(Liu [30]) Let Θ be a nonempty set,Pthe power set of Θ, and Cr a credibility measure. Then the triplet(Θ,P,Cr)is called a credibility space.Definition 3(Liu [30]) A fuzzy variable is a function from a credibility space(Θ,P,Cr)to the set of real numbers.Then a fuzzy random variable can be defined as:Definition 4(Liu and Liu [29]) A fuzzy random variable ξ is a function from a probability space to the set of fuzzy variables defined on a credibility space such that Cr{ξ(ω)∈B} is a measurable function of ω for any Borel set B ofR.To compare fuzzy random variables, we introduce the concepts of chance measure and expected value of fuzzy random variable.Definition 5(Gao and Liu [32]) Letξbe a fuzzy random vector on the probability space(Ω,A,Pr), andfj:Rn→Rbe continuous functions, j=1, 2, …, m. Then the primitive chance of fuzzy random event characterized by fj(ξ)≤0, j=1, 2, …, m is a function from [0, 1] to [0, 1], defined asCh{fj(ξ)≤0,j=1,2,…,m}(α)=supβ|Prω∈Ω|Crfj(ξ(ω))≤0j=1,2,⋯,m≥β≥α.Let ξ and η be two fuzzy random variables. Liu [33] suggested that ξ>η if and only ifCh{ξ≥r¯}(γ)>Ch{η≥r¯}(γ)for some predetermined levelsr¯and γ∈(0, 1].Also the concept of expected value of fuzzy variable is introduced for defining expected value of fuzzy random variable.Definition 6(Liu and Liu [31]) Let ξ be a fuzzy variable. The expected value of ξ is defined byE[ξ]=∫0+∞Cr{ξ≥r}dr−∫−∞0Cr{ξ≤r}drprovided that at least one of the above two integrals is finite.Definition 7(Liu and Liu [29]) Let ξ be a fuzzy random variable. Then its expected value is defined byE[ξ]=∫0+∞Pr{ω∈Ω|E[ξ(ω)]≥r}dru−∫−∞0Pr{ω∈Ω|E[ξ(ω)]≤r}drprovided that at least one of the above two integrals is finite.Let ξ and η be two fuzzy random variables. Liu and Liu [29] suggested that ξ>η if and only if E[ξ]>E[η], where E is the expected value operator of fuzzy random variable.As we mentioned above, we can compare project costs or project completion times via their expected values, which is the most widely used decision-making criterion in practice. Actually, many decision-makers, who are indifferent to risk, usually want to find the optimal decision with minimum expected project cost subject to some expected completion time constraint. Hence, in fuzzy random time–cost trade-off problem, with the decision-making criterion of optimizing expected values, we can build the following expected cost minimization model:minE[C(x,ξ)]subject to:E[T(x,ξ)]≤T0xij∈[lij,uij],∀(i,j)∈Axij,∀(i,j)∈A,integerswhere E is the expected value operator of fuzzy random variable, T0 is the due date of the project, lijand uijare integers given in advance, and T(x,ξ) and C(x,ξ) are defined by (1) and (2), respectively.The philosophy of chance-constrained programming initiated by Charnes and Cooper [34] is a useful decision-making criterion, with which managers prefer satisfying some chance constraints with at least some given confidence levels. In fact, we are not always concerned with optimizing expected project costs or expected completion times. Sometimes we have to consider the risk, referred to as the chance that some unfavorable event will occur. Hence, in this problem, decision-maker may want to obtain the optimization goals with fuzzy random constraints holding at least some given confidence levels. Accordingly, we can establish an (α, β)-cost minimization model as follows:minC0subject to:Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(α)≥βCh{T(x,ξ)≤T0}(γ)≥δxij∈[lij,uij],∀(i,j)∈Axij,∀(i,j)∈A,integerswhere T0 is the due date of the project, lijand uijare integers given in advance, and T(x,ξ) and C(x,ξ) are defined by (1) and (2), respectively. Here, the so-called (α, β)-cost of a project is defined as:Definition 8The (α, β)-cost of a project is defined as min{C0|Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(α)≥β}, where α and β are predetermined confidence levels.In real-life project, decision-maker's main goal is always to control the project cost within the finance budget and meanwhile complete the project before the time limit. However, due to the environmental uncertainty, sometimes these project scheduling goals cannot be obtained absolutely. Hence, to decision-maker a realistic approach may be to maximize the chance that the project cost does not exceed some finance budget under the constraint that the chance of finishing the project before the due date should be larger than or equal to a predetermined confidence level, which shows the philosophy of dependent-chance programming [35,36]. With this criterion, we can present the following chance maximization model:maxChC(x,ξ)≤C0(α)subject to:Ch{T(x,ξ)≤T0}(γ)≥δxij∈[lij,uij],∀(i,j)∈Axij,∀(i,j)∈A,integerswhere α, γ, and δ are predetermined confidence levels, T0 is the due date of the project, C0 is the budget, lijand uijare integers given in advance, and T(x,ξ) and C(x,ξ) are defined by (1) and (2), respectively.If the fuzzy random vectorξdegenerates to a random vector, then the expected value operators in the expected cost minimization model becomeE[C(x,ξ)]=∫0∞Pr{C(x,ξ)≥r}dr−∫−∞0Pr{C(x,ξ)≤r}dr,E[T(x,ξ)]=∫0∞Pr{T(x,ξ)≥r}dr−∫−∞0Pr{T(x,ξ)≤r}drwhich are just the conventional expectation concepts of the random variables C(x,ξ) and T(x,ξ), respectively. Therefore, the fuzzy random expected cost minimization model becomes the stochastic expected cost minimization model in Ke et al. [17].Simultaneously, the chance constraint Ch{T(x,ξ)≤T0}(γ)≥δ is equivalent to Pr{T(x,ξ)≤T0}≥γ. Similarly, the objective functions min{C0|Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(α)≥β} and Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(γ) are equivalent to min{C0|Pr{C(x,ξ)≤C0}≥α} and Pr{C(x,ξ)≤C0}. Hence, the (α, β)-cost minimization model and the chance maximization model become the stochastic α-cost minimization model and the probability maximization model in Ke et al. [17].On the other hand, if the fuzzy random vectorξdegenerates to a fuzzy vector, then the expected value operators becomeE[C(x,ξ)]=∫0∞Cr{C(x,ξ)≥r}dr−∫−∞0Cr{C(x,ξ)≤r}dr,E[T(x,ξ)]=∫0∞Cr{T(x,ξ)≥r}dr−∫−∞0Cr{T(x,ξ)≤r}drwhich are the expected values of the fuzzy variables C(x,ξ) and T(x,ξ), respectively. Then the fuzzy random expected cost minimization model becomes the fuzzy expected cost minimization model in Ke et al. [24].The chance constraint Ch{T(x,ξ)≤T0}(γ)≥δ becomes Cr{T(x,ξ)≤T0}≥δ according to the concept of fuzzy variable. The objective functions min{C0|Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(α)≥β} and Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(γ) are equivalent to min{C0|Cr{C(x,ξ)≤C0}≥β} and Cr{C(x,ξ)≤C0}. Therefore, the (α, β)-cost minimization model and the chance maximization model become the fuzzy β-cost minimization model and the credibility maximization model in Ke et al. [24].In this section, for solving the above fuzzy random time–cost trade-off models, a hybrid intelligent algorithm is briefly introduced, in which the fuzzy random simulations are designed to estimate the objective functions and chance constraints and embedded into GA to search for the quasi-optimal solutions.In this paper, there exist three types of uncertain functions with fuzzy random parameters E[C(x,ξ)], min{C0|Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(α)≥β} and Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(α). Next, the detailed fuzzy random simulation process will be performed.First we design a fuzzy random simulation method to simulate the chance function Ch{T(x,ξ)≤T0}(α). That is, with the definition of chance measure, we should find the maximal β such thatPr{ω∈Ω|Cr{T(x,ξ)≤T0}≥β}≥α.The details of the first type of fuzzy random simulation method are shown as follows:Algorithm 1:(Fuzzy random simulation for chance measure)Generateω1,ω2, …,ωNfrom Ω according to the probability measure Pr, where N is a sufficiently large integer.Compute the credibility βn=Cr{T(x,ξ)≤T0} for n=1, 2, …, N by fuzzy simulation.Set N′ as the integer part of αN.Return the N′th largest element in {β1, β2, …, βN}.Note that the relevant fuzzy simulation methods can be found in Ke et al. [24].According to the concept of chance measure, for simulating min{C0|Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(α)≥β} we should find the minimal C0 such thatPr{ω∈Ω|Cr{C(x,ξ)≤C0}≥β}≥α.The process can be summarized as follows:Algorithm 2:(fuzzy random simulation for (α, β)-cost)Generateω1,ω2, …,ωNfrom Ω according to the probability measure Pr, where N is a sufficiently large integer.FindC¯n0=inf{Cn0|Cr{C(x,ξ(ωn))≤Cn0}≥β}for n=1, 2, …, N by fuzzy simulation.Set N′ as the integer part of (1−α)N.Return the N′th largest element in{C¯10,C¯20,…,C¯N0}.According to the concept of expected value of fuzzy random variable, the expected costEC(x,ξ)can be simulated as follows:Algorithm 3:(Fuzzy random simulation for expected value)Set E=0.Generateωfrom Ω according to the probability measure Pr.E←E+E[C(x,ξ(ω))], where E[C(x,ξ(ω))] can be calculated by fuzzy simulation.Repeat the second and third steps N times, where N is a sufficiently large integer.EC(x,ξ)←E/N.To find an optimal schedule for the above models, we need to design some heuristic algorithm. Since GA is an effective method for practical optimization problems, we embed the fuzzy random simulation methods into GA to design a hybrid intelligent algorithm. The procedure of the algorithm can be summarized briefly as follows.Algorithm 4:(Hybrid intelligent algorithm)Initialize pop_size chromosomes, where the three types of fuzzy random functions can be calculated and the feasibility can be checked by the proposed fuzzy random simulation methods.Update the chromosomes by crossover and mutation operations, in which the feasibility of offsprings may also be checked by the proposed fuzzy random simulations.Compute the objective values for all chromosomes and accordingly calculate the fitness of each chromosome.Select the chromosomes by spinning the roulette wheel.Run the second to fourth steps for a given number of cycles and report the best chromosome as the quasi-optimal solution.Now consider the project with the AOA network structure shown in Fig. 1. The duration times, the normal costs and the extra costs of the activities are presented in Table 1, respectively. Especially, the duration times are assumed to be fuzzy random variables, denoted by a form of triangular fuzzy variable (ρ+g, ρ+h, ρ+i), where g, h and i are given crisp numbers and ρ is a uniformly distributed random variable with distribution function shown in the column “Distribution”. For simplicity, we assume that the decision variable xijis an integer and limited in the interval [−4, 4] for each (i, j)∈A.The first instance is the fuzzy random (α, β)-cost minimization model, where the manager want to minimize the (0.90,0.90)-cost of the project:minC0subject to:Ch{C(x,ξ)≤C0}(0.90)≥0.90Ch{T(x,ξ)≤60}(0.90)≥0.90xij∈[−4,4],∀(i,j)∈Axij,∀(i,j)∈A,integers.In the hybrid intelligent algorithm, several parameters are given in advance, including the population size of one generation pop_size, the probability of mutation Pm, and the probability of crossover Pc, which are set as different values to obtain a group of optimal solutions and optimal values. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid intelligent algorithm, we compare the optimal values obtained via the different algorithm parameters. From Table 2we find that the ‘Error's, calculated by the formula (actual value – optimal value)/optimal value × 100%, do not exceed 0.74%, which does not exceed the general management demand. Therefore, the designed hybrid algorithm is effective for solving the fuzzy random (α, β)-cost minimization model.Next, let us think over an instance of the fuzzy random expected cost minimization model:minE[C(x,ξ)]subjectto:E[T(x,ξ)]≤60xij∈[−4,4],∀(i,j)∈Axij,∀(i,j)∈A,integers.From Table 3, we can see that the difference among the listed costs is little as the largest relative error is only 0.81%, which shows the effectiveness of the designed hybrid intelligent algorithm.The last numerical example is the following chance maximization model:maxChC(x,ξ)≤29500(0.9)subject to:Ch{T(x,ξ)≤60}(0.9)≥0.9xij∈[4,4],∀(i,j)∈Axij,∀(i,j)∈A,integers.From Table 4we can say that the designed hybrid intelligent algorithm is stably performed as the errors are not larger than 1.66%.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The trade-off between the project cost and the project completion time is an important issue for managers. In addition, the uncertainty in the time–cost trade-off problem is also noticeable as uncertain factors do exist in real projects. In this paper, for solving the time–cost trade-off problem in mixed uncertain environment with randomness and fuzziness, the fuzzy random (α, β)-cost minimization model, the fuzzy random expected cost minimization model and the fuzzy random chance maximization model were built. To solve the models, the hybrid intelligent algorithm integrating the fuzzy random simulations and GA was designed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was illustrated by three numerical experiments.
