@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents an approach for breast cancer diagnosis in digital mammograms using wave atom transform. Wave atom is a recent member of the multi-resolution representation methods. Primarily, the mammogram images are decomposed on the basis of wave atoms, and then a special set of the biggest coefficients from wave atom transform is used as a feature vector. Two different classifiers, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors, are employed to classify mammograms. The method is tested using two different sets of images provided by MIAS and DDSM database.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Breast cancer still remains as the most dangerous and common cancer among women around the world. Therefore, periodic screening, which is seen as the most effective way, is required both for protection and fighting against the disease. Mammograms are an effective and reliable method to detect breast cancer accurately at an early stage [1]. However, mammogram reading is not an easy task. Some cases are overlooked by radiologists due to the busy working conditions. To help radiologists and reduce the risk of missing cases, computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are developed. Another important issue except overlooked cases is false positive ones. 60–90% of the cases diagnosed with cancer are found benign after biopsies [2]. This situation increases the importance of the development of the CAD systems. In CAD systems, feature extraction is one of the very important steps in achieving best classification results.Some of the successful feature extraction studies which focus on multi-resolution analysis methods represent images by decomposing into the low and high frequency sub-bands. While some of them are using wavelet, some are using contourlet or curvelet transform. Beura et al. [3] proposed a breast cancer classification scheme using two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. They generated a feature matrix obtained from GLCM of all the detailed coefficients of 2D-DWT of the region of interest (ROI). Having obtained the relevant features from the feature matrix, they used t-test and F-test methods, separately. Pak and Kanan [4] proposed a non-subsampled contourlet transform to improve image quality. In the preprocessing stage, the ROIs were determined by super-resolution algorithm. Feature matrix was formed using some features (compactness, area, etc.) of image components and the skewness of each feature. The support vector machine (SVM) was used to classify the mammograms. Eltoukhy et al. [5] decomposed mammogram images into curvelet sub-bands. After decomposing, a set of the biggest coefficients of curvelet transform is evaluated as a feature vector. Ratios (10%:90%) of coefficients obtained from each decomposition level were processed by the Euclidean distance classifier.One of the most effective and recent multi-resolution analysis methods is wave atom transform. Leung et al. [6] implemented wave atom transform to watermark images. Their experimental results indicated the superiority of the wave atoms when compared to the existing watermarking schemes using multi-scale transformations. Rajeesh et al. [7] used the wave atom transform to classify textures. A feature matrix in the system was created using wave atom coefficients. Next, the created feature space was reduced by using singular value decomposition. The classification process was performed using SVM. Elangeeran et al. [8] proposed a procedure of the classification of microcalcifications consisting of a wave atom transform and a circular complex-valued extreme learning machine (CC-ELM). The most successful classification rates were obtained when reducing the feature set by using a principal component analysis (PCA). Rajesh et al. [9] proposed a CAD system to determine the type of microcalcification in a mammogram using wave atom and SVM. To construct the feature vectors, they calculated the energy of wave atom coefficients for each sub-band. Gedik and Atasoy [10] represented a CAD system using wave atom transform for feature extraction. Every ROI was decomposed into the sub-bands in the wave atom domain. Feature matrixes were generated from wave atom coefficients for each scale, separately. These were used to feed SVM classifier. To increase the accuracy rate and reduce the feature space, PCA was used. The system gave a better success rate at scales 1, 2, and 3 by employing SVM with PCA.In this study, we propose a CAD system based on wave atom transform as well. The reason for choosing the wave atom transform is to uncover its unexplored capabilities through on the basis of a different approach via a mammography study. The system uses feature matrixes consisting of a special set of biggest coefficients. These are used to feed the classifiers in changing ratios (10% and 90% of coefficients) and categorize mammograms. The aim is to determine which couple (scale, ratio of biggest coefficients) will give the highest classification rate. The classifiers used in the study are k-NN and SVM. In conclusion, three main ideas are explored in this paper: using fractions of wave atom coefficients, applying them to two different databases and using two different classifiers.Wave atom transform was introduced by Demanet and Ying in 2007 [11]. It is a variant of 2-D wavelet packets and it also obeys the parabolic scaling relation, wavelength∼(diameter)2. Wave atom has better frequency localization, which is a problem for filter banks. Additionally, oscillatory functions or oriented textures like engineering surfaces have a significantly sparser expansion in wave atoms than in any other fixed standard representations like Gabor filters, wavelets, and curvelets.For a better understanding of wave atom transform to distinguish it from other transforms, two parameters, (α, β), are used as families of wave packets. They index a lot of known wave packets architectures. The α parameter determines whether the decomposition is multi-scale or not. The β parameter determines whether the basis elements of a transform are either localized and poorly directional or extended and fully directional. If α is equal to 1, the decomposition is multi-scale. If α is equal to 0, the decomposition is not multi-scale. If β equal to 1, basis element is localized and poorly directional. If β equal to 0, basis element is extended and fully directional. Fig. 1illustrates the place of wave atom and other transforms according to α and β [11].Wave atoms capture both the coherence of the pattern along the oscillations and the pattern across the oscillations. For a formal definition of 2-D wave atom, wave atoms are represented as φμ(x), with subscript µ=(j, m, n)=(j, m1, m2, n1, n2). All five quantities j, m1, m2, n1, n2 are integer-valued and index a point (xµ, ωµ) in phase-space, as(1)xμ=2−jn,ωμ=π2jm,C12j≤maxi=1,2mi≤C22jwhere C1 and C2 are two positive constants, xµ is the position vector and it is the center of φμ(x) and the wave vector ωμdetermines the centers of both bumps ofφˆμ(ω)as ±ωμ[11]. The elements of a frame of wave packets {φμ} are called wave atoms when:(2)φˆμ(ω)≤CM·2−j(1+2−j|ω−ωµ|)−M+CM·2−j(1+2−j|ω+ωµ|)−M,(3)|φμ(x)|≤CM·2j(1+2j|x−xµ|)−M,for allM>0.(4)ψˆm0(ω)=e−iω/2eiαmgεmω−πm+12+e−iαmgεm+1ω+πm+12,where ɛm=(−1)mandαm=π2m+12[11]. The function g is an appropriate real-valued function, compactly supported on an interval of length 2π, and chosen as follows:(5)∑m|ψˆm0(ω)|2=1K-NN algorithm is a well-known and instance-based classifier. According to the algorithm, every instance corresponds to the points in the N-dimensional space and an instance is assigned to the majority class calculating its k-nearest neighbors. The nearest neighbors are determined by standard Euclidean distance [12].(6)dst(x,y)=∑i=1N(xi−yi)2SVM is a supervised classifier calculating a hyperplane to separate a set of objects with maximum margin. An optimal hyperplane is determined using support vectors which are obtained from the feature space [13]. For linearly separable cases, a SVM classifier is as follows:(7)f(x)=wTx+bwhere w and b denote a weight vector and a bias, respectively. In case of the nonlinear cases, the input vector x is mapped into a higher dimensional space using a kernel trick. With nonlinear mapping ϕ(x), the SVM classifier becomes;(8)f(x)=wTϕ(x)+bIn this study, two datasets from the mammographic image analysis society (MIAS) [14] and the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) [15] were used. Images in each database were previously investigated and labeled by an expert radiologist who has a technical experience. Databases include various cases and they are widely used in similar research [16–19]. While the MIAS database has 322 mammograms consisting of 51 malignant, 64 benign and 207 normal cases, the DDSM database has 2548 cases including 914 malignant, 870 benign and 764 normal cases. In this experiment, two datasets were separately created using MIAS and DDSM database and ROIs were manually cropped from original mammograms in the size of 128×128 pixels including abnormalities inside it. Every ROI center corresponds to the center of abnormality. ROI selection in normal cases was randomly made using the equal number of all tissue types. The distributions of the ROI images used in our study are illustrated in Table 1for both datasets.The study includes four phases. The first one is the obtaining of ROIs from original mammograms. The second is the application of wave atom transform to each ROI and obtaining the coefficients of it. The third one is the creation of feature matrixes for every scale of each dataset. The features are rearranged in the descending order of biggest coefficients. For the classification, changing ratios (10%:90%) of features (coefficients) are used to feed the classifiers. Calculation of ratios of coefficients is performed as follows:(9)cr=CNS×r100,r=10,20,…,90where CNS donates number of coefficients in the scale and cr is ratio of the coefficients. The number of coefficients in each scale are 32, 1120, 11,648 and 19,968 for scale 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The fourth one is the classification, which is performed in two steps. While the first section of the classification is to distinguish the ROIs as normal–abnormal, the second one is to identify the abnormal ones as benign–malignant. All stages described above were applied to two datasets, individually. The procedure of the proposed system is represented in Fig. 2.The classification was performed using two classifiers; SVM and k-NN. The SVM classifier is optimized using a 10-fold cross-validation. The k value that would provide maximum classification result is obtained implementing 31 different values starting from 3 for k-NN classifier. In the classification stage, the feature sets are divided into two groups; training group (70% of ROIs) to build the classifiers and testing group (30% of ROIs) to calculate the performance of the classifier. For the performance evaluation, the sensitivity, specificity analyses and f-measure are performed. For this purpose, the following expressions are used:(10)Accuracy=TP+TNTP+FP+FN+TN(11)Sensitivity=TPTP+FN(12)Specificity=TNFP+TN(13)F-measure=2×precision×recallprecision+recallwhere TP, TN, FP and FN indicate the true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively. The expression of precision and recall correspond to positive predictive value (PPV) and true positive rate (TPR) (also called sensitivity), respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, the wave atom transform is investigated by using ratios of its coefficients obtained from different scales as a feature extractor to classify mammograms. The aim of this study is to determine the couples that provide the best classification performance. According to the results of normal–abnormal classification, the best couples that give highest classification rates are scale 1 and 50% of coefficients of it for SVM classifier and scale 1 and 20% of coefficients of it for k-NN classifiers. In case of benign–malignant classification, the best couples are scale 2 and 20% of coefficients of it for SVM classifier and scale 1 and 20% of coefficients of it for k-NN classifiers.
