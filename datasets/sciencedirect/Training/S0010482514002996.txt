@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, an adaptive robust control strategy is developed for the manipulation of drug usage and consequently the tumor volume in cancer chemotherapy. Three nonlinear mathematical cell-kill models including log-kill hypothesis, Norton–Simon hypothesis andEmaxhypothesis are considered in the presence of uncertainties. The Lyapunov stability theorem is used to investigate the global stability and tracking convergence of the process response. For the first time, performance of the uncertain process is investigated and compared for three nonlinear models. In addition, the effects of treatment period, initial value of tumor volume (carrying capacity) and the uncertainty amount on dynamic system behaviour are studied. Through a comprehensive evaluation, results are presented and compared for three cell-kill models. According to the results, for a wide range of model uncertainties, the adaptive controller guarantees the robust performance. However, for a given treatment period, more variation in drug usage is required as the amount of model uncertainty increases. Moreover, for both the nominal and uncertain models, less drug usage is required as the treatment period increases.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
During the drug delivery process in chemotherapy, normal healthy cells may be killed in addition to the cancer cells [1,2]. Some control strategies have been proposed for the effective killing of cancer cells and minimizing the negative aspects of drugs on healthy cells. For this purpose, drugs delivery must be regularly scheduled to maintain a specific level of the drug dosage in the body. Therefore, understanding the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on tumors behaviour is important in development of efficient treatment strategies.Several models have been presented for the killing of cancer tumor cells in chemotherapy process. In log-kill hypothesis as an early model, it was shown that cell killing (using the chemotherapeutic drug) is proportional to the tumor population [3]. Thus, it is shown in this hypothesis that the volume of larger tumors is reduced more rapidly than smaller tumors for a fixed dose of drug [3]. After that, in some clinical observations, the predictions of log-kill hypothesis fail in some cases such as Hodgkin’s disease and acute lymphoblast leukemia (in these cases, larger tumors reduce slower than the similar smaller tumors) [4–6]. Consequently, Norton Simon hypothesis was proposed [4,5], in which the cell-kill was considered to be proportional to the tumor growth rate. Finally, in Emax hypothesis, the cell-kill rate was assumed to be proportional to a saturable function of tumor mass [7]. This hypothesis is obtained from the fact that chemotherapy drugs must be metabolized by an enzyme before their activation. However, this metabolism is saturable because the amount of enzyme is fixed in the body.For the above-mentioned hypotheses, open loop unconstrained and constrained control methods have been proposed [6,8–11]. As a constrained drug delivery control, bang-bang control strategy has been used for the nonlinear models. The application of feedback control with a quadratic performance criterion for the mathematical models of cancer chemotherapy has been studied in the early works [8,9]. In other researches [10,11], considering normal and tumor cells under the hypotheses of Gompertzian and logistic growth, the rate of drugs administration was controlled.Another open-loop control strategy utilized for chemotherapy process is the control parameterization technique. In this method, optimal control problem is transformed into a numerical problem and the control variables are approximated with the constant values in specified time intervals [12,13]. Using this optimal control strategy, the dosage of specific drugs (e.g., paclitaxel) has been determined for the reduction of breast and ovarian cancers [14]. Moreover, it is concluded that treating with repeated shorter periods allows more drug to be given without excess damage to the bone marrow [14,15].Mathematical details of optimal control techniques and their therapeutic performances in different cell-kill hypothesis including treatment schedules have been studied in other researches, e.g., [6]. Moreover, some other approaches have also been investigated, such as: optimal singular control in chemotherapy [16,17], the influence of fixed and free final time of treatment on optimal chemotherapeutic protocols [18], optimal control for a stochastic model of cancer chemotherapy [19], optimal control for the tumor model with immune resistance and drug therapy [20], a comparison between linear and quadratic controls [21] and a comparison between optimal control for different models [22]. In some other researches, model simulation and experimental validation of intratumoral chemotherapy using multiple polymer implants [23], sensor-based cell and tissue screening for personalized cancer chemotherapy [24] have been accomplished. A multi-objective optimal chemotherapy control model for cancer treatment [25] has also been proposed.It should be noted that chemotherapy processes similar to other dynamic systems are potentially accompanied with various sources of uncertainty. The dynamic model inaccuracies are in the form of structured and unstructured uncertainties; described through parametric or model (non-parametric) uncertainties, respectively. These uncertainties are due to either sensor fusion systems (direct measurement) or observers algorithms (indirect measurement). As a result, previous control strategies may not guarantee a robust performance in the presence of uncertainties and for a wide range of operating conditions, e.g., [8–14,16–22].In a recent study [26], for achieving the robust performance against uncertainties, three control approaches including optimal linear regulation, nonlinear optimal control based on variation of extremals and H∞-robust control were developed. It was shown that H∞controller has the most efficient performance for the uncertain plants; however its conceptual design is rather complex. For some previous linear controllers, e.g., [8–14,16–22] and two other linear controllers recently proposed in [26] (H∞-robust and optimal linear regulation), the nonlinear model should be linearized around its operating points. Therefore, choosing these operating points affects the performance of the controller, and the controller has desired performance only in the areas close to these operating points.In this research, a nonlinear adaptive control strategy is developed for the chemotherapy process described through log-kill hypothesis,Emaxhypothesis and Norton–Simon hypothesis. The nonlinear adaptive controllers are designed based on Lyapunov stability theorem which guarantees the global stability and tracking convergence of the problem. Unlike the linear controllers in [8–14,16–22,26] that require the linearization around the operating points, the proposed nonlinear controller does not require linearization and its performance is not related to some operating points or areas. As a result, the nonlinear controller could achieve to its goal with the desired performance independent from the points (or states) during the process.Moreover, unlike the previous works, parametric uncertainties associated with the dynamic models are also included. It should be mentioned that the linear controllers [8–14,16–22,26] are affected from the parameters of the original nonlinear model and their uncertainties especially in linearization procedure. However, for the proposed nonlinear adaptive controller, the nonlinear model parameters are considered to be completely uncertain and their magnitudes do not affect the controller design. The amount of tumor volume is manipulated by adaptive variation of drug usage. For the first time, performance of the uncertain process is investigated and compared for three nonlinear models (with an adaptive controller). In addition, the effects of treatment period, initial value of tumor volume (carrying capacity) and the uncertainty amount on dynamic system behaviour are studied. Results are presented and compared for three cell-kill models.As it is mentioned, several approaches have been developed for modeling the process of tumor cells killing; which is also called chemotherapeutic induced cell-kill. In an early work by Schabel, Skipper and Wilcox, it was hypothesized that cell-kill due to a chemotherapeutic drug was proportional to the tumor population [3]. This hypothesis was obtained based on in-vitro studies in the murine leukemia cell-line L1210. According to this hypothesis, a specified dose of drug kills a constant fraction of the cells independently from the tumor size. Moreover, there is a relationship between the drug dosage and the percentage of the killed leukemia cells. Consequently, large tumors are diminished more rapidly than smaller tumors with a specific dosage of drug. This proposed hypothesis is called as the log-kill mechanism in the literature. This model is valid for experimental leukemia because the growth dynamics of the cancer is constant during the course of observation. However, it failed when applied to the experimental solid tumors of human in which tumor size approached a plateau level (in which tumor dynamics is approximated by Gompertzian growth curves) [27,28].After that, Norton and Simon [4,5] found that the log-kill model contradicts some clinical observations, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin’s disease. In these cases, reduction in small tumors was histologically faster than in similar larger tumors. Consequently, Norton and Simon hypothesized that the cell-kill is proportional to the growth rate of the tumor (e.g., as an exponential, logistic, or Gompertzian functions). In a recent work, a simple realistic biophysical model of tumor growth in the presence of a constant continuous chemotherapy is studied, and it was shown that if an extended Norton–Simon hypothesis holds, the system may have multiple equilibria [29]. Therefore, the tumor carrying capacity and/or the drug pharmacodynamics (and/or the drug pharmacokinetics) are affected by the bounded stochastic fluctuations which cause the transition from a small equilibrium to a far larger one, not compatible with the life of the host. Finally, in another hypothesis, it was mentioned that some chemotherapeutic drugs must be metabolized by an enzyme before being activated. Due to the fixed amount of enzyme, this reaction is saturable. Accordingly, Holford and Sheiner [7] proposedEmaxhypothesis in which the cell-kill is described in terms of a saturable function of Michaelis–Menton form. The concentration effects of drugs is essentially considered and discussed inEmaxmodel. This model introduces theoretical support from the physicochemical principles (by inclusion the law of mass action); governing the binding of drug to the receptor [30].In this section, Skipper’s log-kill hypothesis (called Model 1),Emaxhypothesis (called Model 2) and Norton–Simon hypothesis (called Model 3) are considered. General dynamics of these systems is presented through differential equations as [3–6]:(1)dxdt=rxF(x)−G(x,t)wherexis the tumor volume,ris the tumor growth rate,F(x)is the generalized growth function andG(x,t)describes the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the drug. While the tumor burden and toxicity level are defined as the time-integral of the drug concentration, the Growth function (Gompertzian) is expressed as:(2)F(x)=ln(Θx)whereΘis the constant of scaling. For the mentioned hypotheses,G(x,t)is described as:(3-1)Forlog-killhypothesis(Model1):G(x,t)=δ(xΘ)u(t)(3-2)ForEmaxhypothesis(Model2):G(x,t)=δxu(t)x+λ(3-3)ForNorton−Simonhypothesis(Model3):G(x,t)=δF(x)u(t)whereλandδare constant coefficients of the model andu(t)is the chemotherapy drug concentration (density); e.g., in the plasma compartment.u(t)=0means the absence of drug effect andu(t)>0denotes the amount or strength of the drug effect. It should be mentioned that for simplicity in next formulations, simulation results and discussions, ‘drug usage’ is used instead of ‘drug concentration’. Usingx˜=x/Θ,λ˜=λ/Θandδ˜=δ/Θfor scaling the models given by Eq. (3-1) and dropping the ‘~’ in the quantityχ˜,χ=x,λ,δ; the following differential equations are obtained [6]:(4-1)(Model1)dxdt=−rxln(x)−δxu(t)(4-2)(Model2)dxdt=−rxln(x)−δxλ+xu(t)(4-3)(Model3)dxdt=−ln(x)[rx−δu(t)]with the initial condition ofx(0)=x0; where the tumor volume is normalized by using the mentioned change of variables as0<x0<1.In this section, the adaptive control strategy is developed for proposed cell-kill hypotheses in cancer chemotherapy process. The goal of adaptive control strategy is tracking the desired volume of the cancer tumor (defined by the chemotherapy physician), while the cell-kill models are associated with uncertainties. The feedback signal used in these controllers is the volume of tumor. Using the Lyapunov theorem, the stability of closed-loop control systems (for all three models) and the convergence of tumor volume reduction to the desired value (xd) are presented. Moreover, it is shown that using the adaptation law for updating the estimated parameters of the system, the estimation error of model parameters is remained bounded. A schematic of the cancer chemotherapy process using proposed nonlinear adaptive controllers for drug delivery of different tumor models is shown inFig. 1.Dynamics of the log-kill hypothesis (Model 1, Eq. (4-1)), can be rewritten as:(5)(Model1)−1δẋx−rδln(x)=u(t)PropertyThe left-hand side of Eq. (5), by considering an arbitrary variableϕinstead ofẋ, is linearly parameterized in terms of the system parameters as [31]:The regressor matrixY1and the vectorθ1contain known functions and unknown parameters of the system, respectively as:(7)Y1=[−ϕx−ln(x)];θ1=[1δrδ]TThe adaptive control law is defined as:(8)u(t)=−1δ^(ẋd−αx˜)x−r^δ^ln(x)The accent∧is used for estimated values of parameters.δ^andr^are estimates of the system parametersδandr, respectively. These estimated parameters are obtained via an adaptation law, as will be presented next.x˜=x−xdis the error vector for the tumor volume with respect to the desired volume (xd), andαis a positive constant. Using Property, and substitutingϕ=ẋd−αx˜in Eq. (6), the control law (Eq. (8)) is rewritten as:(9)u(t)=Y1(ẋd−αx˜,x)θ^1whereθ^1is the vector of estimated parameters. Now, the adaptation law for updating the vector of estimated parameters is introduced as:(10)θ^̇1=x˜xΓY1Tsgn(δ)whereΓis a symmetric positive definite constant matrix. It will be shown in the following Lyapunov stability proof that the adaptation law by Eq. (10) provides the tracking performance in the presence of parametric uncertainties. The Lyapunov theorem [31] is used for proving the stability of the system and asymptotic tracking of the desired tumor volume (xd) during chemotherapy. For this purpose, a Lyapunov function candidate is used as:(11)V=12(x˜2+|δ|θ˜1TΓ−1θ˜1)whereθ˜1=θ^1−θ1is the error vector for parameters estimation. According to Eq. (11), the Lyapunov function is always positive (V≥0). The time derivative ofVis obtained as:(12)V̇=x˜(ẋ−ẋd)+|δ|θ^̇1TΓ−1θ˜1whereθ˜̇1=θ^̇1, becauseθ1is the vector of the constant actual parameters and thereforeθ̇1=0. Substituting the dynamics of Model 1, Eq. (4-1) in Eq. (12), yields:(13)V̇=−rx˜xln(x)−δx˜xu(t)−x˜ẋdesired+|δ|θ^̇1TΓ−1θ˜1Substituting the control law (given by Eq. (8)) in Eq. (13) yields:(14)V̇=−rx˜xln(x)+δr^δ^x˜xln(x)+δδ^x˜ẋd−δδ^αx˜2−x˜ẋd+|δ|θ^̇1TΓ−1θ˜1By adding and subtractingαx˜2, and arranging Eq. (14), it can be written as:(15)V̇=−αx˜2−δx˜x[−(ẋd−αx˜)x−ln(x)]θ˜1+|δ|θ^̇1TΓ−1θ˜1Substitutingϕ=ẋd−αx˜in Eqs. (6) and (15) is modified as:(16)V̇=−αx˜2−δx˜xY1(ẋd−αx˜,x)θ˜1+|δ|θ^̇1TΓ−1θ˜1Then, using the adaptation law given by Eq. (10) andΓ=ΓTin Eq. (16), the time derivative of Lyapunov function is obtained as:(17)V̇=−αx˜2≤0According to Lyapunov stability theorem, through Eqs. (11) and (17), the proposed control method guarantees the global stability and tracking convergence (x˜→0orx→xdast→∞). In other word, if the drug is consumed according to the law suggested by the controller, the actual volume of tumor (x) converges to its desired value (xd).ProofThe Lyapunov functionVin Eq. (11) is positive definite inx˜andθ˜1. SinceV̇is negative definite (V̇≤0),Vis also bounded and therefore,x˜andθ˜1are bounded. We know that the desired tumor volume (xd) and its time derivative (ẋd) are bounded. Therefore, according tox˜=x−xd,xis bounded and consequently according to system dynamics by Eq. (4-1),ẋis also bounded. As a result,x˜̇=ẋ−ẋdis bounded from the boundedness ofẋandẋd. Finally, to apply Barbalat’s lemma [31], the uniform continuity ofV̇should be checked. Differentiating Eq. (17) with respect to time, yields:This implies thatV¨is bounded sincex˜andx˜̇are bounded. Thus,V̇is uniformly continuous. Using Barbalat’s lemma, it is proved thatx˜→0ast→∞and the vector of parameters estimation errorθ˜1remains bounded. Using Eq. (7), the estimation error of two parameters of the model (δ˜andr˜) will be remained bounded. Therefore, the objective of the proposed adaptive controller (tracking convergence,x˜→0) is achieved; while, the identification of the actual parameters is not obtained (which is not a goal for the controller).Dynamics of theEmaxhypothesis (Model 2, Eq. (4-2)), can be rewritten as:(19)(Model2)−1δ(1+λx)ẋ−rδ(x+λ)ln(x)=u(t)Similarly, using the samePropertygiven in previous section, the left-hand of Eq. (19) can be linearly parameterized in terms of the system parameters as:(20)−1δ(1+λx)ϕ−rδ(x+λ)ln(x)=Y2(ϕ,x)θ2where the regressor matrixY2and the vectorθ2contain known functions and unknown parameters of the system, respectively as:(21)Y2=[−ϕ−ϕx−xln(x)−ln(x)];θ2=[1δλδrδrλδ]TThe adaptive control law for Model 2 is defined as:(22)u(t)=−1δ^(1+λ^x)(ẋd−αx˜)−r^δ^(x+λ^)ln(x)whileδ^,λ^andr^are the estimated parameters of the system (see previous section). Substitutingϕ=ẋd−αx˜in Eq. (20), the control law is rewritten as:(23)u(t)=Y2(ẋd−αx˜,x)θ^2whereθ^2is the vector of estimated parameters. The adaptation law for updating the vector of estimated parameters is introduced as:(24)θ^̇2=x˜xΓY2Tsgn(δ)In this section, the following Lyapunov function candidate is used,(25)V=12((x+λ)x˜2+|δ|θ˜2TΓ−1θ˜2)whereθ˜2=θ^2−θ2is the error vector for parameters estimation. According to Eq. (25), sinceλis a positive constant and the tumor volume is always positive (x≥0); the Lyapunov function is always positive (V≥0). The time derivative ofVis obtained as:(26)V̇=(x+λ)x˜(ẋ−ẋd)+12ẋx˜2+|δ|θ^̇2TΓ−1θ˜2whereθ˜̇2=θ^̇2, andθ̇2=0(with the same reason discussed for Model 1). It is desired to reduce the tumor volume in chemotherapy process. Therefore, the time derivative of tumor volume is negative during the treatment (ẋ<0). From Eq. (26) we have:(27)V̇≤(x+λ)x˜(ẋ−ẋd)+|δ|θ^̇2TΓ−1θ˜2Using the dynamics of Model 2 (Eq. (4-2)) in Eq. (27), we have:(28)V̇≤−r(x+λ)x˜xln(x)−δx˜xu(t)−(x+λ)x˜ẋd+|δ|θ^̇2TΓ−1θ˜2Substituting Eq. (22) in Eq. (28), yields:(29)V̇≤−r(x+λ)x˜xln(x)+δr^δ^(x+λ^)x˜xln(x)+δδ^(x+λ^)x˜ẋd−δδ^(x+λ^)αx˜2−(x+λ)x˜ẋd+|δ|θ^̇2TΓ−1θ˜2Adding and subtracting(x+λ)αx˜2to Eq. (29) and its rearrangement, yields:(30)V̇≤−(x+λ)αx˜2+|δ|θ^̇2TΓ−1θ˜2−δx˜x[−ϕ−ϕx−xln(x)−ln(x)]θ˜2where,ϕ=ẋd−αx˜. Substituting Eq. (20) in Eq. (30), yields:(31)V̇≤−α(x+λ)x˜2−δx˜xY2(ẋd−αx˜,x)θ˜2+|δ|θ^̇2TΓ−1θ˜2Using the adaptation law given by Eq. (24) andΓ=ΓTin Eq. (31), the time derivative of Lyapunov function is obtained as:(32)V̇≤−α(x+λ)x˜2≤0Sinceλ>0and the tumor volume is positive (x≥0), thenx+λ>0. Therefore, according to Lyapunov stability theorem, through Eqs. (25) and (32), proposed control method guarantee the global stability and tracking convergence.The continue of stability proof is presented in Appendix A. As it is concluded in Appendix A, the objective of the proposed adaptive controller (tracking convergence,x˜→0) is achieved; while, the identification of the actual parameters is not obtained (which is not a goal for the controller).Dynamics of the Norton–Simon hypothesis (Model 3, Eq. (4-3)), can be rewritten as:(33)(Model3)1δẋln(x)+rδx=u(t)Similarly, using the samePropertygiven in Section 3.1, the left-hand of Eq. (33) can be linearly parameterized as:(34)1δϕln(x)+rδx=Y3(ϕ,x)θ3whereϕis an arbitrary variable; the regressor matrixY3and the vectorθ3contain known functions and unknown parameters of the system, respectively as:(35)Y3=[ϕln(x)x];θ3=[1δrδ]TThe adaptive control law for Model 3 is defined as:(36)u(t)=1δ^(ẋd−αx˜)ln(x)+r^δ^xSubstitutingϕ=ẋd−αx˜in Eq. (36), the control law is rewritten as:(37)u(t)=Y3(ẋd−αx˜,x)θ^3whereθ^3is the vector of estimated parameters. The adaptation law for updating the vector of estimated parameters is introduced as:(38)θ^̇3=−x˜ln(x)ΓY3Tsgn(δ)In this section, the following Lyapunov function candidate is used,(39)V=12(x˜2+|δ|θ˜3TΓ−1θ˜3)whereθ˜3=θ^3−θ3is the error vector for parameters estimation. According to Eq. (39), the Lyapunov function is always positive (V≥0). The time derivative ofVis obtained as:(40)V̇=x˜(ẋ−ẋd)+|δ|θ^̇3TΓ−1θ˜3whereθ˜̇3=θ^̇3, andθ̇3=0(with the same reason discussed for Model 1). Substituting the dynamics of Model 3, Eq. (4-3), into Eq. (40), results in:(41)V̇=−rx˜xln(x)+δx˜ln(x)u(t)−x˜ẋd+|δ|θ^̇3TΓ−1θ˜3Substituting the control law given by Eq. (36) into Eq. (41), yields:(42)V̇=−rx˜xln(x)+δr^δ^x˜xln(x)+δδ^x˜ẋd−δδ^αx˜2−x˜ẋd+|δ|θ^̇3TΓ−1θ˜3Adding and subtractingαx˜2to Eq. (42) and its rearrangement, yields:(43)V̇=−αx˜2+δx˜ln(x)[(ẋd−αx˜)ln(x)x]θ˜3+|δ|θ^̇3TΓ−1θ˜3Substitutingϕ=ẋd−αx˜in Eq. (34), Eq. (43) is modified as:(44)V̇=−αx˜2+δx˜ln(x)Y3(ẋd−αx˜,x)θ˜3+|δ|θ^̇3TΓ−1θ˜3Using the adaptation law given by Eq. (38) andΓ=ΓTin Eq. (44), the time derivative of Lyapunov function is obtained as:(45)V̇=−αx˜2≤0According to Lyapunov stability theorem, through Eqs. (39) and (45), proposed control method guarantee the global stability and tracking convergence.ProofThe Lyapunov functionVis positive definite in terms ofx˜andθ˜3(Eq. (39)). SinceV̇is negative definite (V̇≤0),Vis also bounded and therefore,x˜andθ˜3are bounded. With a similar reasoning presented for the Model 1 in Section 3.1, the variablesx,ẋ,x˜andx˜̇are bounded. DifferentiatingV̇given by Eq. (45), with respect to time, yields:This implies thatV¨is bounded sincex˜andx˜̇are bounded. Thus,V̇is uniformly continuous. Using Barbalat’s lemma, it is proved thatx˜→0ast→∞and the error vector for parameters estimationθ˜3remains bounded. Using Eq. (35), the estimation error of two parameters of the model (δ˜andr˜) will be remained bounded. Therefore, the objective of the proposed adaptive controller (tracking convergence,x˜→0) is achieved; while, the identification of the actual parameters is not obtained (which is not a goal for the controller).For the problem simulation and investigation the effect of designed adaptive controllers, realistic model parameters are adopted from [6], as listed inTable 1. These parameters are scaled as non-dimensional values; obtained via experimental observations on different kinds of cancers (in which various drugs such as Taxol for the reduction of breast and ovarian cancers have been used). The adaptive control algorithms are developed in MATLAB with the procedure discussed in previous section. Tumor volume is normalized such that0≤x≤1in all mentioned models. Results are presented for two interval times of treatment astf1=30daysandtf2=15days. Two desired scenarios for tumor reduction are considered as (can be prescribed by the cancer physician):(47)xd=(x0−b)exp(−at)+bwhereais the rate of tumor reduction in cancer chemotherapy that should be adjusted by the physician andbis the desired steady state value for tumor volume (final value).x0andxdare the initial and desired values of tumor volume, respectively. It should be mentioned that the exponential functions for reducing the tumor volume are considered (Eq. (47)) which is in accordance with the scenarios used in the previous optimal controls such as [3–6, 8–14, 26]. However, without loss of generality, other functions for desired tumor volume reduction can be used. For two scenarios with interval times of treatmenttf1=30daysandtf2=15days, these parameters are selected:(48)xd1:a=0.15,b=0.01for30daystreatmentperiodxd2:a=0.4,b=0.01for15daystreatmentperiodDesired scenarios for tumor reduction in interval times oftf1=30daysandtf2=15days; and for the initial condition as 90% of carrying capacity (x0=0.9) are shown inFig. 2. Time response of the tumor volume in tracking of first desired scenario (xd1by Eq. (48)), in treatment time of 30 days is shown inFig. 3a, forx0=0.9. As it is observed, after implementation of controller, desired tracking objective is obtained in all three cell-kill hypotheses. To achieve the desired tracking behaviour, the drug usage must be adjusted according to the schedules presented in Fig. 3b.Fig. 4 shows the estimated and real values of system parameters1/δandr/δin Model 1, log-kill hypothesis (while an initial 20% error is assumed for each parameter). As it is observed, adaptive controller guarantees the estimation with an acceptable bounded error during the chemotherapy. Similarly, the effectiveness of adaptive control strategy in estimation of dynamic system parameters (with a bounded estimation error) can be investigated for two other models. For the sake of brevity, related results are not presented. The existence of bounded error for parameters estimation is in accordance with the Lyapunov stability analysis presented for each model in Section 3. There, it is proved for each model that the parameters estimation error (θ˜i) has a bounded value that may not converge to zero.Similar to Fig. 3, time response of the tumor volume in tracking of second desired scenario (xd2by Eq. (48)), in treatment time of 15 days is shown inFig. 5a and b, forx0=0.9andx0=0.5, respectively. As it is observed, after implementation of the controller, desired tracking objective is obtained in all three cell-kill hypotheses. The corresponding variation in drug usage is presented in Fig. 5c and d. According to Fig. 5c and d, generally more drug usage is required for tumors with larger volume (as physically expected).According to Figs. 3 and 5 for first and second desired scenarios, under steady state conditions, adaptive controller predicts less amount of drug usage in Norton–Simon andEmaxhypotheses, respectively. However, in the first days of treatment, more drug usage is predicted in theEmaxhypothesis (in comparison with log-kill). This may be an adverse effect of adaptive controller inEmaxhypothesis, due to negative side aspect of high drug consumption in the beginning of treatment.Finally, it should be mentioned that in both Figs. 3 and 5, the amount of drug usage in Norton–Simon hypothesis (Model 3) is significantly less than those of log-kill andEmaxhypotheses. This is because, according to Eq. (4-3), control inputu(t)is multiplied by functionln(x)which itself is a large quantity around the small values of tumor volume (i.e.,ln(x)→∞asx→0). Moreover, according to Table 1, the magnitude ofδin Model 3 is 10–20 times of those used in Models 1 and 2. Consequently, due to these reasons, the amount of drug usage in Norton–Simon hypothesis is essentially low.As it is shown in Figs. 3 and 5, adaptive controller guarantees the desired tracking of tumor reduction in both scenarios with 30 and 15 days of treatment. Moreover, as it is found out by comparing Figs. 3b and 5c (and physically expected), in all three models, more drug usage is required in the second scenario (xd2) with shorter period of treatment (15 days) in comparison with the first scenario (xd1) that has longer treatment period (30 days), both forx0=0.9.To investigate the effect of uncertainties, parameters of the uncertain models are assumed to be varied with 10%, 20% and 50% of nominal values as:(49)(1−χ)r¯i<ri<(1+χ)r¯i,(1−χ)δ¯i<δi<(1+χ)δ¯i,(1−χ)λ¯<λ<(1+χ)λ¯i=1,2,3,χ=0.1,0.2,0.5while the nominal values ofr¯i,δ¯iandλ¯are given in Table 1. It is observed that in the presence of various amounts of uncertainties given by Eq. (49), desired tracking objectives of Fig. 2 are obtained (in all cell-kill models). For the perfect tracking of desired objective in the first scenario within 30 days (xd1by Eq. (48)), drug consumption must be scheduled according toFig. 6; for the uncertain models withx0=0.9. For the sake of brevity, similar results forx0=0.5and second scenario (xd2) are not presented.In the presented simulation, the uncertain actual values ofr¯i,δ¯iandλ¯are considered to be equal to(1−χ)r¯i,(1+χ)δ¯iand(1+χ)λ¯, respectively. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 6, as the amount of uncertainty (χ) is increased, more drug usage is required to achieve the desired behaviour for tumor reduction (xd1). A significant increase in drug usage is observed in the presence of 50% uncertainty (in comparison with nominal model and uncertain models with 10% and 20% uncertainty). It should be mentioned that 50% uncertainty in model parameters is a theoretical assumption that may not be occurred in practice (this case is considered for comparison purpose).Finally, the variation of drug usage in three models and for the uncertain plants with 20% uncertainty is shown inFig. 7; for two desired scenarios (whilex0=0.9). Due to similar behaviour, results are not presented for uncertain plants with 10% and 50% uncertainty. Again and similar to what was observed for the nominal plants in Figs. 3c and 5c; under steady state conditions, adaptive controller predicts less amount of drug usage in uncertain Norton–Simon andEmaxmodels, respectively. In addition, comparing Figs. 7, 3c and 5c reveals that in the presence of model uncertainties, more drug usage is required in perfect tracking of tumor reduction (in comparison with nominal plants).In this section, the effect of uncertainty in initial guess of parameters used in adaptive control law is investigated on dynamic response of the cell-kill models. It is assumed that there is 10%, 20%, 50% and 90% uncertainty in initial guess for parametersθi,i=1,2,3, given by Eqs. (7), (21) and (35). For the sake of brevity and due to similar behaviour, the following results are only presented for Model 1 (log-kill hypothesis); with 30 days treatment. According toFig. 8, the error vector for tumor volume (x˜=x−xd) is a small value which finally converges to the zero; for various amounts of uncertainty in initial guess ofθ1(in Fig. 8, the log-kill model itself is certain; i.e., nominal model is used).Finally, to complete the investigation, it is assumed that the uncertainty exists in both of the model parameters (i.e., as described by Eq. (49)) and initial guess of parameters used in adaptive control law (i.e., uncertainty inθi,i=1,2,3).Fig. 9 shows the error vector of tumor volume (x˜) for the nominal plant and 50%-uncertain plant (i.e.,χ=0.5in Eq. (49)); in the presence of 20% uncertainty in initial guess ofθ1with respect to the nominal model. As it is observed, in both cases, the error vector for tumor volume (x˜) is a small value which finally converges to the zero. Therefore, proposed control strategy is robust against the uncertainties in initial guess of parameters used in construction of control law (either for nominal plant or uncertain plants of the log-kill models). For the sake of brevity, similar results for other cases of Models 2 and 3 and other amounts of uncertainty are not presented.In this section, the performance of the controller is evaluated and shown using discontinuous feedback (with high sampling time) and with the existence of measurement error, and bounded disturbances and/or non-parametric uncertainties in the system; similar to a realistic chemotherapy process.For the sake of brevity, the robustness analysis is only presented for the controller of Model 1 and with the first scenario (xd1) andx0=0.9. For this purpose, first the controller robustness is evaluated with a discontinuous feedback of tumor volume with 2 days sampling time. In other words, the volume of patient’s tumor should be measured one time in every 2-days. Moreover, the bounded measurement error of tumor volume (corresponds to the sensing instrument) is considered to be a combination of a constant and time-varying terms as:Δx=0.05+0.05sin(2t). Accordingly, at the beginning of the chemotherapy process, shown inFig. 10, the tumor volume is aboutx≈x0=0.9and the maximum measurement error is more than 10% of the tumor volume. However, after 6 days of the process that the tumor volume decreases tox≈0.4, the maximum measurement error is about 25% of the tumor volume. Finally, at the end of the cell-killing process (after 20 days of treatment) that the tumor volume decreases tox≈0.05, the maximum measurement error is about 200% of the tumor volume (Fig. 10). Also,dist=0.01−0.01sin(t)is considered as a bounded disturbance (and/or modeling uncertainty) exists in the cell-kill Model 1 as:ẋ=−rxln(x)−δxu(t)+dist. 20% uncertainty is also considered in initial guess of model parameters.The desired tumor volume, the actual tumor volume, the discontinuous signal of desired tumor volume, and the discontinuous signal of the tumor volume (that has a bounded error and used in the controller) are shown in Fig. 10. As it is shown in Fig. 10, the tumor volume is measured at the beginning of each 2 days and this measurement is used as the feedback signal in adaptive controller during 2 days. The corresponding drug usage and parameters adaptation of Model 1 are shown inFig. 11a and b, respectively. It should be mentioned that since the dynamics of the chemotherapy (Eq. (4-1)) is slow, employing the drug usage with 2 days sampling time (Fig. 11a) can effectively control the tumor volume (Fig. 10). As it is observed in Fig. 11b, adaptive controller guarantees the estimation with an acceptable bounded error during the chemotherapy which is in accordance with the Lyapunov stability analysis presented for Model 1 in Section 3.1.As the second part of robustness analysis of the proposed control strategy against disturbances and/or modelling uncertainties, the controller designed for Model 1 (in Section 3.1) is now used for Model 2. Since Model 2 (Eq. (4-2)) has a different structure in comparison with Model 1 (Eq. (4-1)), the performance of the controller is evaluated in the presence of model mismatch. Accordingly, using continuous feedback signal, the time response of the tumor volume in tracking of first desired scenario (xd1in treatment time of 30 days), is shown inFig. 12a forx0=0.9. As it is observed, by implementation of controller designed for Model 1 on Model 2, the tumor volume reduction is obtained; however a bounded tracking error exists due to the model mismatch. The corresponding drug usage is also presented in Fig. 12b. Similarly, the same investigation can be performed for other cases. But, for the sake of brevity, just the performance of controller developed for Model 1 was studied on Model 2.Next, using the discontinuous feedback signal of tumor volume (with 2-days sampling time) and a bounded measurement error (Δx=0.02+0.005sin(t)), the performance of the controller designed for Model 1 is evaluated on Model 2. Accordingly, the desired tumor volume, the actual tumor volume, the discontinuous signal of desired tumor volume, and the discontinuous signal of the tumor volume (that has a bounded error and used in the controller) are shown inFig. 13a forx0=0.9and of 30 days treatment period (xd1). As shown in Fig. 13a, at the beginning of the chemotherapy process when the tumor volume is aboutx≈x0=0.9, the maximum measurement error (Δx=0.02+0.005sin(t)) is more than 2.5% of the tumor volume. However, after 10 days of the process that the tumor volume decreases tox≈0.17, the maximum measurement error is about 15% of the tumor volume. Finally, at the end of the cell-killing process (after 20 days of treatment) that the tumor volume decreases tox≈0.005, the maximum measurement error is about 150% of the tumor volume (Fig. 13a). According to Fig. 13a, by implementation of controller designed for Model 1 on Model 2, the tumor volume reduction is obtained; however a bounded tracking error is observed due to the measurement error, discontinuous control signal and model mismatch. The corresponding drug usage with 2-days sampling time is also shown in Fig. 13b.Therefore, according to Figs. 10–13, the robust performance of the proposed controller against discontinuous feedback (with high sampling time), measurement error, and bounded disturbance and/or modelling uncertainty is shown in addition to its previous robustness to parametric uncertainties.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, an adaptive robust control strategy is developed to adjust the drug delivery schedule and consequently tumor reduction in cancer chemotherapy. To investigate the global stability and tracking convergence of the process, Lyapunov stability theorem is used. For the first time, the efficiency of adaptive control strategy is studied on cancer chemotherapy in the presence of model uncertainties. Proposed nonlinear control approach is applied on three cell-kill models including log-kill hypothesis (Model 1),Emaxhypothesis (Model 2) and Norton–Simon hypothesis (Model 3). In these models, cell-kill is proportional to the tumor mass, a saturable function of tumor mass and tumor growth rate, respectively.Two desired scenarios for tumor reduction during treatment periods of 30 days and 15 days are considered. Over the treatment interval, performance of the controlled systems including the amount of drug usage and tumor volume are investigated and compared (for three nonlinear models under two desired scenarios). The effects of treatment period, initial value of tumor volume (carrying capacity) and the uncertainty amount on dynamic system behaviour are studied. Through a comprehensive evaluation, results are presented and compared for three cell-kill models. Moreover, the performance of the controller using discontinuous feedback signal and with the existence of measurement error, and bounded disturbances and/or modeling uncertainties is evaluated. According to the results, the following conclusions can be extracted:1.After implementation of controller, desired tracking objective is obtained in all three cell-kill hypotheses for both scenarios with treatment periods of 30 days and 15 days. Moreover, this perfect tracking is also obtained for the chemotherapy process in the presence of model parametric uncertainties.During the chemotherapy process, adaptive controller guarantees the estimation of model parameters with an acceptable bounded error.To suppress the tumor, generally more drug usage is required for tumors with larger volume. In addition, for both nominal and uncertain plants of the cell-kill models, more drug consumption is required in treatments of shorter periods (while the initial and final volumes of tumor are kept fixed).Under steady state conditions, adaptive controller predicts less amount of drug usage in Norton–Simon andEmaxhypotheses, respectively. However, in comparison with the log-kill model, more drug usage is predicted in theEmaxmodel during the first days of treatment (which may cause a negative side aspect due to high drug consumption).It is observed that the proposed adaptive controller is robust against a wide range of model uncertainties. Moreover, as the amount of uncertainty increases, more drug usage is required to achieve the desired behaviour for tumor reduction. In other words, the controller could rapidly adapt to the system uncertainties and adjust the control input.The proposed control strategy is robust against the uncertainties in initial guess of parameters used in construction of control law (either for nominal plant or uncertain plants of the cell-kill models).Also, the controller shows the robust performance against discontinuous feedback of tumor volume (with high sampling time), measurement error of tumor volume, and bounded disturbances and/or modelling (non-parametric) uncertainties.Finally, it should be mentioned that the proposed robust adaptive controller can be applied on any other bioprocesses related to the chemotherapy or other similar health treatments. However, achievement of this purpose depends on the extraction of governing dynamic model.Non declared.In this section, the continue of the Lyapunov stability proof for Model 2 (presented in Section 3.2) is presented.ProofThe Lyapunov functionVin Eq. (11) is positive definite inx˜andθ˜2. SinceV̇is negative definite (V̇≤0),Vis also bounded and therefore,x,x˜andθ˜2are bounded. Consequently according to system dynamics by Eq. (4-2),ẋis bounded. We know that the desired tumor volume (xd) and its time derivative (ẋd) are bounded. Therefore, according tox˜=x−xd,x˜is also bounded. As a result,x˜̇=ẋ−ẋdis bounded from the boundedness ofẋandẋd. Thus,Y2(ẋd−αx˜,x)is also a bounded matrix. Moreover, since the vector of actual parameters of the system (θ2) and the vector of parameters estimation error (θ˜2) are bounded, the boundedness ofθ^2is obtained fromθ˜2=θ^2−θ2. If second time derivative of the desired tumor volume (x¨d) is bounded, it can concluded thatẎ2(x,ẋ,xd,ẋd,x¨d)is a bounded matrix. Using Eq. (32), and adding the negative term(1/2)ẋx˜2,V̇=−α(x+λ)x˜2+(1/2)ẋx˜2≤0is obtained. By replacingẋfrom Eq. (4-2) into the latterV̇, yields:DifferentiatingV̇with respect to time yields:(A.3)V¨=−αẋx˜2−2α(x+λ)x˜x˜̇+(−rxln(x)−δxx+λY2θ^2)x˜x˜̇+(12)(−rẋln(x)−rẋ−δλẋ(x+λ)2Y2θ^2−δxx+λ(Ẏ2θ^2+Y2θ^̇2))x˜2This implies thatV¨is bounded sincex,ẋ,x˜,x˜̇,Y2,Ẏ2,θ^2andθ^̇2are all bounded. Thus,V̇is uniformly continuous. Using Barbalat’s lemma, it is proved thatx˜→0ast→∞and the error vector for parameters estimationθ˜2remains bounded. Using Eq. (21), the estimation error of three parameters of the model (δ˜,λ˜andr˜) will be remained bounded.
