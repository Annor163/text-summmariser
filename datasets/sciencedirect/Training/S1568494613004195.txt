@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Since some assumptions such as the function ϕ(·) needs to be completely specified and the relationship between μ and ϕ(s) must have linear behavior in the model μ=a+bϕ(S) used in the accelerated life testing analysis, generally do not hold; the estimation of stress level contains uncertainty. In this paper, we propose to use a non-linear fuzzy regression model for performing the extrapolation process and adapting the fuzzy probability theory to the classical reliability including uncertainty and process experience for obtaining fuzzy reliability of a component. Results show, that the proposed model has the ability to estimate reliability when the mentioned assumptions are violated and uncertainty is implicit; so that the classical models are unreliable.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In accelerated life testing, the test units are subjected to more severe stresses than those of the normal operating conditions, to shorten the testing time and to get more failures. The estimation of the normal stress level of the process factors based on the accelerated life testing data is performed by an extrapolation process [31]. Three particular acceleration equations that have been commonly used for the extrapolation are the power law model, the Arrhenius model and the Eyring model [20,39]. These models have the common linear structure μ=a+bϕ(S), where ϕ(.) is a pre-specified function, a and b are coefficients that need to be estimated. This model is based on two assumptions: the function ϕ(.) needs to be completely specified and the relationship between μ and ϕ(S) must be linear. If one of these assumptions is violated, then results from extrapolation procedure will not be reliable. As the estimated reliability depends on the extrapolation model, it also will not be reliable.As it is well known, the natural way to degradation is non-linear, since the loss of material at each moment in the time is not proportional. Moreover, if the mechanism of the application is not fully understood, in such form that the appropriate extrapolation model could be completely specified, our results could be biased [33]. It is possible to use a no-linear model to performance the process; however, it contains uncertainty which is not considered by these kinds of models. Therefore, since the information related to the failure of a component, obtained by means of extrapolation process are estimated and are not observed, it is necessary to model the uncertainty as well as the way to degradation of the component. In this case, we could use other tools like fuzzy logic systems, fuzzy regression and fuzzy numbers to model no-linear systems and to make the extrapolation process including the uncertainty.Fuzzy logic systems represent an attractive tool to aid the research, when the precise measurement of model is limited [14], it is because these kind of systems let us to model the spatial variability. For example [37], focused on the prediction of the initiation time for corrosion and/or the estimation of the residual strength of structures. They have pointed out the necessity of modeling the spatial variability of the model parameters in order to be able to characterize, not only the probability of degradation, but also the extent of damage. Since this extent of damage is the natural variable that characterizes the global state of damage of the structure, in this case, it could be used for optimizing maintenance policies.The present paper intents to generate a policy to model degradation process and involve the use of fuzzy sets. Several papers have been proposed, however related works are considered only the use of qualitative information (by means of linguistic variables), as the principal motivation for using fuzzy logic.Shi et al. [35] used opinions from experts to collect information about the importance of the indicators and preference about the alternatives, a fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making method was designed to assess and prioritizing projects of ecological revetment for slope protection. Li [21] showed the modeling of periodic preventive maintenance policies of a system and its parameter estimation of failure distribution and restoration effects on the degradation rate. A fuzzy system was built by using a Particle swarm optimization based method. The performance of the fuzzy system was used as a fitness function to guide the search in Particle swarm optimization. Marano et al. [23] proposed a reliability of reinforced concrete structures where an efficient alternative approach was made by considering fuzzy time-dependent reliability analysis. Sharma et al. [34] proposed the combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques for risk and reliability analysis of a paper mill where fuzzy synthesis of failure and repair data using fuzzy arithmetic's had been used. A new intelligent system for detecting the occurrence of a fault in machinery in real time was proposed by Wang [44], this approach uses a monitory reliability by integrating the predicted machinery conditioned to fault diagnosis. Karbhari et al. [15] used the Arrhenius method and the procedure developed by Phani and Bose [32] for modeling mechanisms and processes of deterioration, also for estimating their rates.On the other hand, fuzzy regression methodology has been used to model processes with fuzziness and limited experimental data sets. Chan et al. [7] proposed a genetic programming based fuzzy regression for modeling manufacturing processes with behaviors that do often carry interactions among variables or higher order terms. A fuzzy linear regression algorithm was used to estimate the contributions and the fuzziness of each branch of the tree, in order to determine the fuzzy parameters of the genetic programming based fuzzy regression model. Tanaka and Lee [38] made an exponential possibility regression analysis by an identification method. They selected the minimum number of coefficient vectors which represent all the given data. Then they applied identification method to determine a possibility distribution of coefficients in the fuzzy linear system. As it was mentioned, the extrapolation process is not linear due to the natural way of degradation, so that these methods are not applicable to the extrapolation process; however they represent a way to address the problem. Mosleh et al. [28] developed a hybrid method based on fuzzy neural network for approximating fuzzy coefficients of fuzzy polynomial regression models with fuzzy output and crisp inputs. They proposed an algorithm from the cost function of the fuzzy neural network. Bargiela et al. [3] presented an iterative algorithm for multiple regression models with fuzzy variables; they posed the regression problem as a gradient-descent optimization. Abdalla and Buckley [1] applied a fuzzy Monte Carlo method to certain fuzzy non-linear regression problems for estimating the best solution of triangular fuzzy numbers, for the fuzzy coefficients in the model. They used a quasi-random number generator to produce random sequences of the fuzzy vectors which uniformly fill the search space; their method obtained solutions as well as evolutionary algorithm. It is worth to mention that, in this work, the non-linear model needed to represent the way of degradation; it does not need any simulation because the data is obtained by means of accelerated life testing, so it is necessary to model real data taken from a degradation process; so that, it is convenient to use triangular fuzzy numbers instead of random data. D’Urso et al. [11] proposed a robust fuzzy linear regression model based on the least median squares-weighted least squares estimation procedure, for data contaminated by outliers. They also defined suitable goodness of fit indices to evaluate the performances of the model.In order to estimate the reliability of a component is necessary to observe a sample conformed by times to failure related of the component in study. Moreover, the classical reliability theory assume that there is some complete probabilistic information about the system or component reliability behavior, that is, two conditions must be fulfilled: (1) all probability distributions are perfectly determinable and (2) the system components are independent. If at least one of these conditions is violated, only an interval reliability measure can be obtained [41]. The fuzzy sets and possibility theory are often used in reliability analysis as an alternative to the classical probability theory; fuzzy reliability models can be viewed as an interesting class of models for taking incompleteness of information into account, with a variety of challenging open research problems. In the present case, these kind of models are useful because times to failure used to determine the reliability of the component are estimated and are not observed, so that, they contains uncertainty. The uncertainty is closely connected with the concept of information. The most fundamental aspect of this connection is that uncertainty is a result of some information deficiency pertaining to the system within which the situation is conceptualized [18]. Then, for including the uncertainty in the reliability model, the theory of imprecise probabilities [42] and its analogs: the theory of interval statistical models [19] and the theory of interval probability [45] can be used, which represent a general and promising tool for reliability analysis. For example [6] mentions some applications of the fuzzy methodology in system failure engineering traced back to Kaufmann's [16] work. An interesting application related to the present work is fuzzy methodology in mechanical/structural reliability; where a system failure occurs as the system stress (load) exceeds the system strength (resistance); the failure criterion and the system load should be fuzzy, of course, the system behavior can be fuzzy too.Considering the related works, in this paper we propose to use a non-linear fuzzy regression model (Section 4) to performance the extrapolation process, in order to include uncertainty in the estimated times to failure of a component analyzed by a degradation process. Therefore, since the times to failure are fuzzy numbers, it was adapted the fuzzy probability theory (Section 3) to the classical reliability analysis (Section 2) for estimating the fuzzy reliability of a component (Section 6). Finally, the method was applied to the data published by Gonzalez et al. [13] in order to test the ability of the proposed method. The principal aim of this paper is to show that is possible to make an accelerated life test analysis including uncertainty and process experience by means of a fuzzy theory.A critical factor of productivity in an industry is the maintenance of its installations, so it is necessary to continually improve its performance. In order to develop an effective maintenance program, an extensive knowledge about the reliability and maintainability is needed. This knowledge is implicit on the reliability engineering, which provides the theoretical and practical tools through which the probability and capacity of parts, components, equipment, products and systems fulfill their required functions in determined periods of time without failures, in specific environments and with a desired confidence that can be specified, designed, predicted, proven and demonstrated [29]. An important tool of reliability engineering for determining the reliability indicators used in the development of maintenance plans is the analysis that uses parametric models of probability which may be represented by means of probability distribution functions. The probability distribution function F(x) represents the results which are obtained in a random experiment. For a given number x, the probability P(X≤x) is given by the function F(x)=(X≤x) This function is denominated the cumulative distribution function of the variable X and represents the probability that the variable takes a value from −∞ to x. Thus, if T is a random variable that represents the component's life, and assuming that T has a cumulative distribution function F(t) expressed by F(t)=(T≤t), then the density probability function f(t) is expressed by [30]:(1)f(t)=dF(t)dtIn addition to f(t) and F(t) of the variable T, other compatible functions exist. One of them is the reliability function R(t) (also called survival function), this function is defined as the probability of a new component does not survive more than time t[12] and is expressed by:(2)R(t)=P{T≤t}=1−F(t)=∫−x∞f(x)dtIn reliability theory, exist a fundamental relationship between f(t) and R(t), that is the hazard rate function. Suppose that the lifetime is a positive random variable with density function f(t) and cumulative function F(t), then the function:(3)λ(t)=f(t)1−F(t)=f(t)R(t)is called the failure hazard rate for F(t)<1. This function represents the instantaneous change on the conditional probability at instant t. It can be considered as a probability measurement of a component that has survived until time t, failing at the following instant [26]. Knowing the failure rate λ(t), it is possible to construct its life time cumulative function since there is a useful relationship between the reliability R(t)=1−F(t)=P(T>t) and the failure rate λ(t):(4)P(T>t)=R(t)=exp∫0tλ(u)duby representing the integral in (4) as−∫0td[log(1−F(t))]On the other hand, a random variable T is of increasing/decreasing failure rate type if the corresponding failure rate λ(t) is an increasing/decreasing function of t. That is, T∈IFR(DFR)ifλ(t) is increasing (decreasing), note that the exponential random variable is, by definition, both of IFR and DFR. A phenomenon related with this fact which is important for reliability theory, is aging. This term means an increase of failure risk as a function of time in use, which represents an appropriate measure of aging. The memory less exponential distribution reflects the “no aging” situation [12].A life time T∈IFR shows an increasing failure risk and the component is subject to aging. If T∈DFR, the failure risk decreases in time, and the corresponding system becomes “younger”. Another approach to aging is considering the conditional survival probability R(x/t), as a function of t, for an interval of fixed length x, [t, t+x] given that the component is alive at t. It is easy to establish that taking the derivative ofR(x/t)=exp−∫tt+xλ(u)duwith respect to t, it is concluded that R(x/t) is decreasing (increasing) in t, if λ(t) is increasing (decreasing).Other important indicators in reliability that have a great impact on maintenance are the MTTF (mean time to failure) which is given by [43]:(5)E[t]=MTTF=∫0∞tf(t)dt=∫0∞R(t)dt.The concept of fuzzy logic (FL) was conceived by Lotfi Zadeh, a professor at the University of California at Berkley, and presented not as a control methodology, but as a way of processing data by allowing partial set membership rather than crisp set membership or non-membership. This theory was not applied to control systems until the 70s due to insufficient small-computer capability. Professor Zadeh reasoned that people do not require precise, numerical information input, and yet they are capable of highly adaptive. FL provides a simple way to arrive at definite conclusion based upon vague, ambiguous, imprecise, noisy, or missing input information. FL does not require precise inputs, is inherently robust [46]. There are different memberships functions associated [24,25]. Some features to note are: triangular is common, but bell, trapezoidal, and, exponential have been used [2].Fuzzy Logic provides a completely different, unorthodox way to approach a modeling problem. This method focuses on what the system should do rather than trying to understand how it works. One can concentrate on solving the problem rather than trying to model the system mathematically, if that is even possible. This almost invariably leads to quicker, cheaper solutions [40]. Once understood, this technology is not difficult to apply and the results are usually quite surprising and pleasing.A fuzzy number is a quantity whose value is imprecise, rather than exact as is the case with ordinary (single-valued) numbers. Any fuzzy number can be thought of as a function whose domain is a specified set (almost always triangular or trapezoidal shaped). In many aspects, fuzzy numbers depict the physical world more realistically than single-valued numbers [5]. A triangular fuzzy numberN¯is defined by three numbers a<b<c where the base of the triangle is the interval [a,c] and its vertex is at x=b. Triangular fuzzy numbers will be written asN¯=(a/b/c). A trapezoidal fuzzy numberM¯is defined by four numbers a<b<c<d where the base of the trapezoid is the interval [a, d] and its top (where the membership equals one) is over [b, c]. We writeM¯=(a/b,c/d)for trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Fig. 1shows a triangular fuzzy numberN¯=(1.5,2,2.5), see thatN¯(2)=1.Note that for modeling the degradation process, it was used triangular shaped fuzzy numbers because the statistical inference is constructed by means of lower and upper confidence limits, so it is useful to describe uncertainty; also, the fuzzy sets with alpha-cuts are best represented by triangular shapes. Although, it was used triangular shaped fuzzy numbers, the results can be extended to general fuzzy numbers.Alpha-cuts are slices through a fuzzy set producing regular (non-fuzzy) sets. IfA¯is a fuzzy subset of some set Ω, then an α-cut ofA¯, writtenA¯[α]is defined as:(6)A¯[α]={x∈Ω|A¯(x)≥α}For any setA¯,A¯(0)is called the support, or base ofA¯. The core of a fuzzy number is the set of values where the membership value equals one. IfN¯=(a/b/c), orN¯≈(a/b/c), then the core ofN¯is the single point b, which represents the crisp number related to the fuzzy number. However, ifM¯=(a/b,c/d), orM¯≈(a/b,c/d), then the core ofM¯=[b,c]. For any fuzzy numberQ¯we know thatQ¯[α]is a closed, bounded, interval for 0≤α≤1. It is written as:(7)Q¯[α]=[q1(α),q2(α)]where q1(α) (q2(α)) will be an increasing (decreasing) function of α with q1(1)≤q2(1). IfQ¯is a triangular shaped or a trapezoidal shaped fuzzy number then: (1) q1(α) will be a continuous, monotonically increasing function of α in [0,1]; (2) q2(α) will be a continuous, monotonically decreasing function of α, 0≤α≤1; and (3) q1(1)=q2(1) (q1(1)<q2(1) for trapezoids). We sometimes check monotone increasing (decreasing) by showing that dq1(α)/dα>0 (dq2(α)/dα<0) holds.LetN¯=(a/b/c), it is writtenN¯≥δ, δ some real number, if a≥δ,N¯≥δwhen a≥δ,N¯≤δfor c≤δ andN¯<δif c<δ. This notation is for triangular and trapezoidal shaped fuzzy numbers whose support is in the interval [a, c]. IfA¯andB¯are two fuzzy subsets of a set Ω, thenA¯≤B¯meansA¯(x)≤B¯(x)for all x in Ω, orA¯is a fuzzy subset ofB¯.A¯<B¯holds whenA¯(x)<B¯(x), for all x[5].LetA¯andB¯two fuzzy numbers, and it is known that alpha-cuts are closed, bounded, intervals soA¯[α]=[a1(α),a2(α)],B¯[α]=[b1(α),b2(α)]. Then ifC¯=A¯+B¯we haveC¯[α]=A¯[α]+B¯[α]for all α in [0, 1]; also,C¯[α]=A¯[α]⋅B¯[α]forC¯=A¯⋅B¯andC¯[α]=A¯[α]/B¯[α]forC¯=A¯/B¯, provided that zero does not belong toB¯[α]for all α. This method is equivalent to the extension principle method of fuzzy arithmetic [17]Anyh:[a,b]→Rmay be extended toH(X¯)=Z¯as follows:(8)Z¯(z)=supx{X¯(x)|h(x)=z,a≤x≤b}Eq. (8) defines the membership function ofZ¯for any triangular fuzzy numberX¯in [a, b]. If h is continuous, then we have a way to find alpha-cuts ofZ¯. LetZ¯[α]=[z1(α),z2(α)]. Then [4]:(9)z1(α)=min{h(x)|x∈X¯[α]}(10)z2(α)=max{h(x)|x∈X¯[α]}for 0≤α≤1.Knowing that the natural way to degradation process is non-linear due to the loss of material behavior, it is necessary to use a non-linear regression model. Sometimes, it is useful to consider a transformation over the function model in order to represent adequately the data observed. Then, consider the function E[y]=f(x, θ)+ɛ as:(11)y=θ1exθ2+εIt could be possible to linearize the expected value function by taking the logarithm:(12)logE[y]=logθ1+θ2xConsequently, it could be attractive to reformulate the model as follows:(13)log(y)=logθ1+θ2x+ε=β0+β1x+εand use the linear regression theory to estimate β0 and β1. However, the parameters estimated by least squares are not equivalent to the non-linear parameters, because the methodology least squares implies the minimization of the sums of squares of the residuals related to y, and the transformed model realizes the minimization related to log(y). A non-linear model could be transformed in an equivalent linear form, but the important restriction is about the errors because the assumptions of the linear model do not apply to the non-linear model [27].A useful method to estimated parameters in non-linear regression is to linearize the non-linear function followed by the Gauss–Newton iterative method. This linearization is realized by developing the function f(x, θ) means of a Taylor series with respect toθ′0=[θ10,θ20,…,θp0]retaining only the linear terms:(14)f(xi,θ)=f(xi,θ0)+∑j=1p∂f(xi,θ)∂θjθ=θ0(θj−θj0)If defined:fi0=f(xi,θ0)βj0=θj−θj0Zij0=∂f(xi,θ)∂θjθ=θ0then the non-linear regression model could be written as follows:(15)yi−fi0=∑j=1pβj0Zij0+εiwhich is a linear regression model, with initial values θ0. Eq. (15) could be written as:(16)y0=Z0β0+εand the estimated vector of β0 is:(17)βˆ0=(Z′0Z0)−1Z′0y0=(Z′0Z0)−1Z′0(y−f0)Therefore, as β0=θ−θ0 it could be defined:(18)θˆ1=βˆ0+θ0as the corrected estimators of θ. In general, the kth iteration is:(19)θˆk+1=θˆk+βˆk=θˆk+(Z′kZk)−1Z′k(y−fk)whereZk=[Zijk]fk=f1k,f2k,…,fnk′θˆk=θ1k,θ2k,…,θpk′This iterative procedure continues until the convergence criterion|(θˆj,k+1−θˆjk)/θˆjk|<δ,is reached. It is necessary to evaluate the residual sum of squares,S(θˆk)to assure that a reduction has been obtained.Once having the vector of parametersθˆ, it could be possible to find its confidence interval. The estimated variance σ2 considering the residual mean of squares is:(20)σ2=∑i=1n[yi−f(xi,θˆ)]2n−p=S(θˆ)n−pwhere p is the number of parameters in the model. The asymptotic covariance matrix forθˆis:(21)Var(θˆ)=σˆ2(Z′Z)−1The diagonal elements of (21) are the approximated variances for the coefficient estimated. LetVar(θˆ)=A=[ajk], then the standard errors in the coefficients are:(22)se(θˆk)=ajjfor j=k. Hence, a (1−α)100% confidence interval for the vector parametersθˆis:(23)θˆkexp(tα/2se(θˆk)/θˆk),θˆkexptα/2se(θˆk)θˆkTo find the critical value tα/2 of the t distribution, it is used (n−p) degrees of freedom. Now, putting the confidence intervals for each parameter together, we obtain the fuzzy estimatorsθ¯kofθˆkrespectively.Accelerated life testing is achieved by subjecting the test units to stresses which are more severe than the normal operating conditions, the results obtained at the accelerated conditions are then extrapolated in order to estimate the failure-time functions [36]. When it is possible to measure the degradation of a system or process, it is possible to realize a model based on the relation between the component's failure and the degradation quantity with respect to time to predict its behavior [13]. Moreover, by means of extrapolation method, the future degradation can be estimated [9]. Also, using the model in combination with the predictive equations, the performance estimates could be made by the probability of failure.It is emphasized in the literature to fully understand the mechanism of the application problems such that appropriate models could be identified for extrapolation [31]. In this case, we could use other tools like fuzzy logic system or non-linear regression for modeling the way of degradation and making the extrapolation process.Hence, by adjusting exponential regression (showed in Section 4) to the degradation data and knowing the process characteristics, we will obtain the times to failure by means of an extrapolation process. The lifetime of an item is defined as the time until performance deteriorates to a specified failure threshold.It could be observed that the times to failure used to determine the reliability of the component are estimated and are not observed, so that contain uncertainty. Hence, this uncertainty is a result of the extrapolation process. Then, for including the uncertainty in the reliability model, the theory of imprecise probabilities and its analogs: the theory of interval statistical models and the theory of interval probability, represent a promising tool for reliability analysis.The fuzzy regression related to Eq. (11) is:(24)y¯(x)=θ¯1exθ¯2+ε¯ory¯(x), withθ¯1andθ¯2fuzzy numbers, andx∈ℝ. The functiony¯(x)is the fuzzy estimator of the degradation quantity related to a specific time. So, it could be possible to predict a fuzzy time to failure for a specified degradation (failure) threshold. Letθ¯1[α]=[θ11(α),θ12(α)],θ¯2[α]=θ21(α),θ22(α)andy¯(x)[α]=[y(x)1(α),y(x)2(α)]. All fuzzy calculations will be done using by α-cuts and interval arithmetic. Then:(25)y(x)1(α)=θ11(α)exθ21α+ε1and(26)y(x)2(α)=θ21(α)exθ22(α)+ε2for all α∈[0, 1]. The α-cut is the (1−α)100% confidence interval. Hence, where a system failure occurs at specified degradation (failure) threshold y0, it is obtained the time to failure of a specific component. It is observed that the prediction is a fuzzy number (Eq. (24)); of course, the system behavior is fuzzy too. Then, theT¯[α]=[(x1|y0)(α),(x2|y0)(α)]will represent the fuzzy time at the system failure occurs for a specified degradation threshold. Once the estimated fuzzy failure times are estimated, they will be used to obtain the fuzzy probability of failure and as a consequence fuzzy reliability of a component. Note that it was decided to use fuzzy numbers instead of a calibration method for estimating the time to failures, due to its degree of complexity.Classical reliability uses a suitable distribution (such as Weibull, Exponential, Log-Normal or Gamma distribution) for modeling the behavior of the life time and estimating the failure probability as Pr(T≤t)=F(t;θ). However in this case, we use the fuzzy number theory (showed in Section 3), adapted to the classical probability for estimating reliability of a component.The classical density function has the form f(t;θ),t∈ℝand the parameters θ. Hence, by using the extension principle showed in Section 3.4, it is feasible to consider the fuzzy density functionf(t;θ¯)for fuzzy numbersθ¯>0. It is wished to compute the fuzzy probability to obtain a value in the interval [c, d] and then, write this fuzzy probability asF¯[c,d]. It is possible to extend these results toF¯[E]for other subsets E ofℝ. For α∈[0, 1],θ∈θ¯[α],then:(27)F¯[c,d][α]=∫cdf(t;θ)dx|θ∈θ¯[α],for 0≤α≤1. The above equation gets the alpha-cut ofF¯=P¯[c,d]. LetP¯[c,d][α]=[p1α,p2(α)]. Then the minimum (maximum) of the expression on the right side of Eq. (27) is p1(α)(p2(α)). Hence, the fuzzy reliability functionR¯[c,d]considering Eq. (2) may be defined as:(28)R¯[c,d][α]=1−∫cdf(t;θ)dx|θ∈θ¯[α],Also, the hazard function given by (3) may be extended to a fuzzy hazard function. Considering Eqs. (27) and (28) a fuzzy hazard function can be:(29)λ¯[c,d][α]=f(t;θ)|θ∈θ¯[α]1−∫cdf(t;θ)dx|θ∈θ¯[α]Moreover, the fuzzy mean is the fuzzification of the crisp mean given by (5). Let the fuzzy mean beM¯(fuzzy MTTF) then its alpha-cuts are [5]:(30)M¯[α]=∫−∞∞xf(x;θ)dx|θ∈θ¯[α].Reliability theory uses a suitable distribution for representing the behavior of the life of a component. These distributional models need to estimate some parameters θ in order to be adjusted to a random sample. There are several methods for estimating the parameters of distributional models such as probability plotting, hazard plotting, maximum likelihood and linear estimators among others [10]. These methods use the sample to adjust the crisp parameters. Suppose a sample observed {t1, t2, …, tn} from a population with density function f(t;θ), so it is desired to find the values of the vector θ which depend on the observed sample values; also assuming that the solutionθˆdoes exist, is unique and correspond with the true values of θ. In this case, the sample consist of fuzzy times to failureT¯[α]=[t1(α),t2(α)], hence it exists some options for estimating the parameters considering the sample characteristics.1.Apply classical method: As the sample consist of fuzzy numbers, apply any classical method for t(α)1 and t(α)2 respectively to obtainθ¯[α]=[θ1(α),θ2(α)].Estimate the fuzzy parameters by expert's process opinion: Assume that there is at least one expert in the process. It is possible to solicit this estimate from expert as is done in estimating job times in project scheduling. Leta=thepessimisticvalue, letc=theoptimisticvalueand letb=themostlikelyvalueof course based in the probability results. Then, construct the triangular fuzzy numberθ¯=[a/b/c]. If a group of experts have to estimate the parameters solicit the ai, biand ci, 1≤i≤N from them and take the mean of each one [5]. It is important to mention that the parameters of some probabilistic models have direct relation with the process that is being modeled, for example the parameter of the exponential model represents the MTTF when there are not censored data in the sample (as is the case). Hence, it is possible to estimate this parameter by expert's process opinionOnce the fuzzy parameters are defined, it is necessary to calculate the alpha-cuts (given in Section 3.2) corresponding to each parameter. Knowing that a value of 0≤α≤1 corresponds toθ¯[α]=[θ1(α),θ2(α)]due to its triangular shape, that is to say, for any fuzzy numberθ¯,θ¯[α]is a closed and bounded interval. In order to compute the fuzzy probability of obtaining a value in the interval [c, d], use the fuzzy distribution given by (27). Note that for each fuzzy number the result will be a probability interval. Also, for any fuzzy valueA¯[α]={a/b/c}, the alpha-cut for α=0 will beA¯[0]={a,c}and for a value α=1 will beA¯[1]={b,b}. Therefore, by using (27)–(30) we will compute the fuzzy probability of failure, the fuzzy reliability, the fuzzy hazard and the fuzzy mean time to failure of any component.The analyzed data was published by Gonzalez et al. [13]. In the study, it was desired to determine the reliability of some types of coatings that would be placed in concrete structural elements for building support. The results were used as a strategy for generating plans of preventive maintenance. The real elements were exposed to polluted environment with an electrolytic solution at 150g/l of concentration and an environmental temperature (°C). For the test, the coatings were exposed to the accelerated life to determine the resistance to the environmental conditions. The systems tested had a polymeric coating with epoxy resin with a silica aggregate and fiberglass reinforcement. The experiment consisted of adding to one of the polymeric coatings a seal with vynilester resin (EWVS) as a finish, in order to determine if this aggregate increased its resistance to the degradation and the effect over the reliability. The system is shown in Fig. 2.The accelerated life test consisted of placing samples with the proposed system in an electrolytic solution with a concentration of 75% of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) to temperature of 95°C in times of 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7h, for accelerating the leaching process. The degradation results were handled in percentage of loss of material, therefore the critical value of failure (degradation threshold) of the polymeric system was 0.5 (2.5mm). This critical percentage was determined by means of the dimensional characteristics of the system (for details see Gonzalez et al. [13]). In order to prove the efficiency of the proposed method for determining the fuzzy reliability of a component, it was applied to the sample obtained by degradation process and compared with the results obtained by Gonzalez et al. [13]. The sample is shown in Table 1.Fig. 3shows the degradation behavior of each sample with respect to the hours of immersion. It is evident that the degradation way could not be modeled by a linear regression; but it can be observed that is an exponential behavior. So that, it was used an exponential regression model to make the extrapolation for estimating the time until the component reach the loss threshold. The results of the adjusted regression model and the fuzzy estimators are shown in Table 2.It can be observed in Table 2 that the model represents adequately the degradation way, since the R2 andRadj2are almost the 100%. Moreover,Radj2for the models indicate that the predictions realized by the adjusted model will be reliable and therefore the estimation of the failure time with respect to a specified loss threshold also will be reliable. Note that, for obtaining the fuzzy estimators, it is needed that the residuals follow a normal distribution; in order to decide if this hypothesis is true an Anderson–Darling test was realized. The p-values show that the assumption is met. Hence the fuzzy estimators are adequate.Once the models for degradation results were obtained, the fuzzy times to failure for each sample were estimated. The results are shown in Table 3.Fig. 4shows the EWVS of the system after 7h of testing, in which it is possible to observe that some areas of the polymeric coating have already exposed the fiberglass due to the material degradation, which is an evidence that the non-linear model realized an adequately prediction about the time to failure of the component. As we can see in Table 3, the fuzzy time for each sample contains the hours of immersion showed in Fig. 4. Also, it is possible to affirm that the component will fail completely at the upper time value of the fuzzy time. Hence, the uncertainty of the extrapolation process is included in the fuzzy times to failure, which is an advantage of the proposed model. Therefore, the fuzzy reliability analysis also will contain the uncertainty about the extrapolation process as well as the uncertainty that may be implied in the parameter estimation.In order to determine which probabilistic model is adequate for the fuzzy times to failure, it was used an Anderson Darling goodness of fit test (for details see D’Agostino and Stephens [8]), the distribution of the sample times follows a two parameters Weibull distribution W(η, β), where η is a scale parameter and β is a shape parameter. The results of the proof were AD=(0.287, 0.412) and p-value >0.25 for t1 and t2 respectively. The Weibull probability density function is:(31)f(t)=βηtηβ−1e−(t/η)βand the Weibull cumulative distribution function is given by:(32)F(t)=1−e−(t/η)βSo, for the interval [c, d] the fuzzy cumulative distribution function would be:(33)F¯[c,d][α]=e−(c/η)β−e−(d/η)β;η∈η¯[α],β∈β¯[α]Hence, from Eq. (28), the fuzzy reliability function for the Weibull model will be given by:(34)R¯[c,d][α]=1+e−(d/η)β−e−(c/η)β;η∈η¯[α],β∈β¯[α]Also, the fuzzy Weibull hazard function λ[c, d][α] will be constructed by means of the quotient off¯[c,d][α]andR¯[c,d][α]as it was mention in Eq. (29). Similarly, by using (30) the fuzzy MTTF is given by:(35)MTTF[α]=ηΓ1+1β;η∈η¯[α],β∈β¯[α]where Γ(·) is the gamma function.As it is well known, in engineering reliability, the parameters of the Weibull model have a specific interpretation related to the process; η represents the life characteristic of the component and the parameter β represents the failure mode. So, the aging (process knowledge) have a specific interpretation related to the shape parameter β. If β<1 a life time T∈DFR (decreasing failure rate) and represents a component which is suffering from infant mortality failures causing by defective materials, poor manufacturing or poor inspection. If β=1 the Weibull distribution becomes Exponential distribution and the memory less reflects the “no aging” situation; that is, the component is characterized by a constant failure rate. Finally, if β>1 a life time T∈IFR (increasing failure rate); it represents components that wear out with age (it represents wearing down material). Note that these three Weibull distributions are characterized at the bathtub curve [10].In the case of degradation, the parameter β has to be β>1, and it represents wearing down material at the bathtub curve. Knowing those characteristics, we propose to estimate the parameters of the model by using those concepts and even experience. First establish the scale η parameter: (a) It could be possible to establish the triangular fuzzy scale parameterη¯=[a/b/c]by soliciting this estimate from process expert as the approximate life of the component. Otherwise, (b) take the median value directly from the fuzzy times to failureT¯asη¯=[median(t1),median(t2)]. After that, considering each value ofη¯to estimate the shape parameterβ¯by means of the least squares method [22].(36)β¯=xˇy¯−log(η¯)where(37)xˇ=1n∑i=1nloglog1(1−(i/n+1))(38)y¯=1n∑i=1nlog(t1i,t2i)Note thatxˇis the same for both sides of the fuzzy parameter andy¯is estimated for each column of the fuzzy time to failureT¯showed in Table 3; thereforey¯is a fuzzy number too. Then the shape parameter estimated by (36) will beβ¯=[min(β1,β2),max(β1,β2)]. Once the fuzzy parameters are defined, it is necessary to calculate the alpha-cuts for each parameter; the fuzzy Weibull parametersη¯[α]=[5.96(α),10.03(α)]andβ¯[α]=[1.75(α),7.47(α)]related to the fuzzy times to failureT¯are shown in Fig. 5.Once knowing the fuzzy parameters (η¯,β¯), we applied them to (33)–(35) to compute the reliability of the component. The comparison between the results obtained by the proposed method and the classical method are shown in Table 4.Figs. 6–8show representation of the fuzzy reliability, fuzzy hazard and fuzzy MTTF. As we can see in Fig. 6, the x-axis represents the reliability estimated for each pair of parameters corresponding to each alpha-cut and the y axis represents the alpha-cuts. The fuzzy reliability goes from 0.2365 to 0.8369, having the highest peak in 0.4756 which represents the more likely probability estimated with the fuzzy parameters for a time t between c=5 and d=8h of testing. It is possible to observe in Table 4 that the reliability obtained by means of the classical method is considerably higher than the proposed, which represents a risk taking decisions about the maintenance frequency. This great difference is because the classical method does not consider the uncertainty in the determination of failure times as well as the parameters estimation, which represents an advantage of the proposed method. Moreover, it could be thinking that the comparison is not adequate because the classical method is considering the cumulative probability from 0 to 7.5 and does not consider just an interval. However, the fuzzy reliability at this cumulative time isR¯[0.0,7.5][α]=[0.038,0.8922]having the highest peak in 0.4748 which is not the 0.9815 estimated by classical method.Also, it can be seen in Fig. 6 that the reliability tends to values near to zero, which indicate that the reliability at this interval tends to be lower; this fact has to be considering in the maintenance plan. On the other hand, the fuzzy hazard of the component is between 0.04 and 8, having the highest peak in 0.47 which corresponds to alpha-cut=1. This peak represents the fuzzy hazard estimated for a time t between c=5 and d=8. It could be observed that the failure rate is increasing which represent wear out with age. That is to say, the component is wearing down while the time is increasing. By considering this situation, should be careful when taking the decision if it is desired to establish a maintenance frequency based at the conventional method, because the hazard rate is very low and it may not be true.Similarly in Fig. 8, the x-axis represents the fuzzy MTTF[α] related toη¯[α]=[5.96(α),10.03(α)]andβ¯[α]=[1.75(α),7.47(α)]for each alpha-cut; the y axis represents the alpha-cuts. The MTTF[α] of the component is between 5.31 and 9.41h, having the highest peek in 7.31h which contains the estimated classical MTTF. However, MTTF is only a crisp value without considering the uncertainty about the time to failure estimation. Therefore, if performed confidence interval for the conventional mean life would be greater than the obtained by the fuzzy method.Now, if it is desired to establish a preventive maintenance frequency based only in certain reliability (for preventive maintenance involving costs and renewal see for example [12] or [47], since it is not the aim of this paper), we could try to predict the time to failure by using the fuzzy probability models. For example, if it is needed to replace a component before it fails because it represents a great human risk as in petroleum industry, it is useful to consider certain high reliability as more than 90%. For doing this, we need a quantile function, in this case, for the Weibull model.Then, as it is used a fuzzy reliabilityR¯[c,d], the result will be a fuzzy time to failureT¯[α]=[t1(α),t2(α)]. It is known that the fuzzy parameterη¯has three components,η¯=[a/b/c]where b represents the highest peak. So, for estimating the fuzzy time to failure, take the value ηbof the parameter (similarly forβ¯). The fuzzy time to failure for a certain fuzzy reliability is calculated by:(39)Tb=ηb{−log(R¯[c,d])}1/βbHence, the fuzzy time to failure will beT¯=[min(Tb),max(Tb)], and for each alpha-cut the time obtained isT¯[α]=[t1(α),t2(α)]. Note that a value ofR¯[0.5,0.5]will be the MTTF[α], so for the present model a value ofR¯[0.5]is the MTTF=0.73. Moreover, if it is desired to establish an inspection frequency between 80% and 90% percent of component reliabilityR¯[0.8,0.9], the fuzzy time to inspection will beT¯[α]=[4.90(α),5.77(α)]hours. Fig. 9shows the fuzzy inspection frequency.Considering that the results seem to be reliable, they could be extended to any probabilistic model; however, the most useful model in engineering reliability is the Weibull due to its close relationship with the process modeled. Therefore, based on the results, the proposed method represents a reliable option to be applied when the uncertainty is implicit; also the proposed method is ease to apply.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
It was proposed to use a fuzzy non-linear regression (Section 4) to model a degradation process, in order to include uncertainty in the estimated times to failure obtained by means of an extrapolation. Therefore, since the times to failure were fuzzy numbers, it was used fuzzy probability theory (Section 3) adapted to the classical reliability analysis (Section 2) for estimating the fuzzy reliability of a component (Section 6). Finally, the proposed method was applied to the data published by Gonzalez et al. [13] in order to test its ability. Hence, it was shown that is possible to include uncertainty by means of a fuzzy theory, in accelerated life test analysis.In the comparison, it was showed (Table 4) that the Weibull fuzzy reliability model performance better than the conventional method, because it contains the uncertainty and the experience about the process.The reliability obtained by means of the conventional method is considerably higher than the proposed because it does not consider the uncertainty in the estimation of failure times as well as the parameters estimation, which represents a risk taking decisions about the maintenance frequency, which is an advantage of the propose method.One more advantage of the fuzzy reliability estimation is that it always obtains a range of possible values for an interval of time, instead of a punctual value. Also, in some cases the fuzzy probabilities and fuzzy parameters in our models may have to be estimated by experts or previous knowledge, as was the case of the Weibull parameters, because there is not enough information about the process for making the statistical inference; having uncertainty. Namely, there is not enough information for estimating the parameters by using methods as maximum likelihood, as is the case of the petroleum installation plants which generally do not have information to make an inspection plan. In those cases the Weibull parameters are estimated by using expert's opinions, MTTF or any other method. Therefore, knowing that in engineering reliability, the parameters of Weibull model have a specific interpretation, we could estimate the parameters of the model by using fuzzy numbers represented by means of triangular functions instead of the classical method (maximum likelihood method), so that, we proposed the estimation given by Eq. (36) considering uncertainty. Moreover, the proposed method is much easier to implement and the results obtained for this particular data, are equally or more reliable than the classical method. Hence in this case, it represents a good option to be applied when some constrains of other methods are not carry out as the linear behavior.Finally, it was shown an application of the model for planning an inspection frequency based on a certain fuzzy reliability, which represents the industrial application of the fuzzy reliability proposed.
