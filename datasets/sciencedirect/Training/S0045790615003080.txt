@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Carbonation is the process of dissolving CO2 in water to form carbonated water for soda drinks. This process involves simultaneous injection of CO2 and water through separate nozzles into a continuously operated carbonating tank. The effectiveness of this process depends on the improved CO2 dissolution in water with the minimum production of gas bubbles. The flow mixing of CO2 gas and water in the carbonating tank represents a gas–liquid bubbly flow problem. Gas bubbles accumulate in the carbonating tank under buoyancy force and generate a circulatory liquid motion. The improved flow circulation enhances the gas concentration level in the fluid, which in turn increases the carbonation process by dissolving a large amount of gas in the tank [1–3]. The carbonation process is effective when CO2 is highly soluble in water. Therefore, the mass transfer of CO2 in water must be estimated to enhance the carbonation process and to optimize the design of carbonating tanks. The mass transfer coefficient is a key parameter in analyzing the two-phase flow in industrial reactors because it helps estimate the gas transfer rate across the gas–liquid interface [4].Several researchers have investigated the effects of various geometric parameters on the gas dissolution process in a two-phase flow. Gas holdup mainly depends on the inlet gas velocity, the physical properties of liquid, and the gas sparger type. The gas volume fraction, the interfacial area, and the mass transfer coefficient increase with high gas inlet velocities [5,6]. Apart from the mass transfer coefficient, the gas bubble size is also an important parameter in exploring two-phase flows because it directly affects the gas volume fraction and the interfacial area [5]. Deckwer et al. [7] measured the mass transfer coefficient in a two-phase flow column with different spargers and reported that such coefficient strongly depends on the type of sparger used for injection. Chisti and Jauregui-Haza [6] asserted that the mass transfer rate decreases when the gas and liquid are mixed by mechanical agitation. However, these experimental studies failed to include the effects of the hydrodynamic properties of the gas dissolved in liquid because of the complexity involved in these two-phase flows [8]. Large-scale experimental multiphase flow systems require a considerable amount of construction time and cost. Recent advances in analytical methods allow researchers to solve any nonlinear differential equations and their systems. The differential transform method (DTM) is a newly developed iterative analytical method for solving systems by using a linear or nonlinear differential equation to reduce the computational work [9–11]. Similarly, Adomian decomposition method (ADM) is used to resolve linear and nonlinear problems. However, compared with DTM, ADM is more advantageous because of its better convergence, accuracy, and reliability in providing exact analytical solutions. ADM produces the exact analytical solution; therefore, it has vast applications in the field of chemical reaction systems [12,13], natural gas engineering [14,15], supercritical system [16], nonlinear resistor and capacitor [17], and conjugated molecules [18].With the advances in the codes of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), complex multiphase flows involved in any system can now be modeled. These codes generally use the Euler–Euler two-fluid model to simulate the flow dynamic properties in gas–liquid systems. The time-dependent flow properties predicted with the CFD Euler–Euler method depict the actual two-phase flow phenomena and are considered in close agreement with the experimental results [19–21]. Huang et al. [22] compared the mass transfer coefficient from the Euler–Euler CFD model with previous experimental data. Consequently, the researchers discovered that the mass transfer coefficient linearly increases with the increase of the superficial gas velocity [22]. Numerous researchers have also investigated the gas dissolution in two-phase bubbly flow. These researchers reported that the gas bubble of large diameter increases the gas holdup. Other scholars stated that the gas volume fraction, the interfacial area, and the gas bubble diameter are several important parameters in modeling the two-phase turbulent bubbly flow [23,24]. By applying the same Euler–Euler methodology, we previously modeled the two-phase flow in an industrial odor removing system. Such an investigation primarily explored the mixing and gas dissolution phenomenon based on the gas volume fraction, interfacial area, and gas concentration [25]. However, these past numerical studies did not consider the effects of the geometrical design of spargers and the velocity of the inlet liquid on the gas dissolution process. Therefore, a detailed simulation study should be conducted to investigate the flow mixing phenomenon of CO2 in water considering the effects of the design of the injecting nozzle or the sparger as well as the velocity of the inlet liquid.This study aimed to investigate the two-phase turbulent bubbly flow with mass transfer in a carbonating tank by applying the Euler–Euler methodology. The L-shaped water-injecting nozzle was placed in the middle section of the tank, which was initially filled with CO2 gas to examine the effect of water flow on gas absorption. The flow mixing phenomenon was improved by filling half of the carbonating tank with water and the remaining half with CO2. The shape of the water nozzle was further modified to enhance the gas dissolution and carbonation processes. Various injecting nozzle designs, gas bubble sizes, and liquid and gas velocities were employed to determine their effects on gas volume fraction, liquid velocity, gas concentration, interfacial area, and mass transfer coefficient.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the hydrodynamic and mass transfer modeling of the carbonating tank. Section 3 introduces the numerical method and its implementation to model the bubbly flow mixing in the carbonating tank. Section 4 presents the verification of proposed methodology and the obtained numerical results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.In actual physical situation, a 3D carbonating tank model is generally used to produce the carbonation process by dissolving CO2 gas in water. However, modeling a 3D carbonating tank with multiphase fluids (i.e., water and CO2) is computationally expensive and difficult. Therefore, this study only considered a 2D tank model to easily visualize the gas–liquid flow mixing with the mass transport through a cross-sectional view and to save computational time and cost. A 2D model of the carbonating tank (diameter = 0.19 m) with an aspect ratio (axial length to outer diameter) of 1.63 is presented in Fig. 1. The L-shaped liquid nozzle (diameter = 0.008 m) was placed in the middle of the tank to induct water. The carbonating tank was initially filled with CO2 gas through a nozzle (diameter = 0.004 m), which was placed at the top right corner of the tank (model A). The half portion of the tank was filled with water, and the remaining half contained CO2 to improve the gas dissolution process (model B). Fig. 1 demonstrates that the shape of the water nozzle was further modified to enhance the flow mixing of CO2 gas in water with a minimum production of gas bubbles (model C).Instead of treating every bubble individually, this study adopted the Euler–Euler method to model the two-phase flow mixing in the carbonating tank because it could resolve the averaged phase concentration [21,25]. The continuity and momentum transport governing equations for the liquid and gas phases are as follows:(1)ρl(∇·ul)=0(2)φlρl∂ul∂t+φlρlul·∇ul=−∇p+∇·[φlμl(∇ul+(∇ul)T)]+φlρlg(3)∂ρgφg∂t+∇·(ρgφgug)=−mglwhere φ is the volume fraction (m3/m3), ρ is the density (kg/m3), u is the velocity (m/s), p is the pressure (Pa), μ is the dynamic viscosity (Pa⋅s), g is the gravity vector (9.81 m/s2), subscripts l and g are the liquid and gas phases, respectively, and mglis the mass transfer rate from gas to liquid (kg/m3 s).The gas density was calculated with the ideal gas law expressed below [26].(4)ρg=(p+pref)MRTwhere M is the molecular weight of CO2 (44.01 kg/kmol), R is the ideal gas constant (0.1889 KJ/kg K), prefis the reference pressure (1 × 105 Pa), and T is the CO2 temperature (298 K).The closure relation for the phase volume fraction (φ) in the two-phase flow can be depicted as follows:(5)φl+φg=1where φland φgare the liquid and gas volume fractions, respectively.The relation for the gas velocity is denoted by the following equation:(6)ug=ul+uslipwhere ug, ul, and uslipare the gas, liquid, and slip velocities (m/s), respectivley.The slip velocity (uslip) could be determined with the gas momentum transport equation (Eq. 3). Buoyancy causes the gas bubbles to move upward, and the pressure forces are assumed to approximately balance the viscous drag forces on the gas bubble. Therefore, the gas transport equation could be reduced into the below equation to form an equilibrium between the viscous drag force and the pressure gradient [26].(7)34Cddb|uslip|uslip=−∇pwhere Cd is the drag coefficient (dimensionless), db is the gas bubble diameter (0.002 m), uslipis the slip velocity (m/s), and p is the pressure force (Pa).The drag coefficient (Cd) for the gas bubbles in the water could be measured with an empirical relation shown below.(8)Cd=0.6221Eo¨+0.235This study used a dimensionless Eötvös number (Eo¨) to measure the importance of the surface tension forces compared with body forces and to characterize the shape of the gas bubbles moving in a surrounding liquid [25,27].Eo¨was evaluated with the following equation:(9)Eo¨=gρldb2σwhere g is the gravitational force (9.81 m/s2), db is the gas bubble diameter (0.002 m), ρlis the liquid density (kg/m3), and σ is the surface tension coefficient (0.07 N/m).The k–ε turbulence model with additional source terms was used to model the turbulence because of the relative motion between the gas bubbles and the liquid. The governing equations for the turbulent kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate ɛ are respectively given as follows:(10)ρl∂k∂t−∇·[(μ+μTσk)∇k]+ρlul·∇k=12μT(∇ul+(∇ul)T)2−ρlɛ+Sk(11)ρl∂ɛ∂t−∇·[(μ+μTσɛ)∇ɛ]+ρlul·∇ɛ=12Cɛ1ɛkμT(∇ul+(∇ul)T)2−ρlCɛ2ɛ2k+ɛkCɛSk(12)μT=ρlCμk2ɛwhere μTis the dynamic viscosity (Pa s), σkand σɛ are the turbulent Prandtl numbers, and Cɛ1 and Cɛ2 are the first and second experimental model constants, respectively. These constants were set asσk=1.0,σɛ=1.3,Cɛ1=1.44,Cɛ2=1.92,Cɛ=1.46,andCμ=0.09.The source term Skfor the bubble-induced turbulence (W/m3) is defined below.(13)Sk=−Ckφg∇p·uslipwhere φgis the gas volume fraction (m3/m3), and uslipis the slip velocity (m/s). The bubble-induced turbulence parameter (Ck) was set as 0.505. The water nozzle and the CO2 gas were assigned with inlet water and gas velocities of 0.0001 (ul) and 0.001 m/s (ug), respectively.The flow mixing of CO2 with water during the carbonation process involves mass transfer between the gas and liquid phases. In this study, two-film theory was used to model this mass transfer across the gas and liquid interfaces during the gas absorption process in the carbonating tank [25,28,29]. The mass transfer rate (mgl) was modeled with two-film theory and Henry's law because of the CO2 absorption in water in Eq. 3.(14)mgl=km(p+prefH−c)MaThe Euler–Euler method adopted the below relation to calculate the interfacial area (a) between the two phases [30].(15)a=(4nπ)1/3(3φg)2/3where kmis the mass transfer coefficient (m/s), H is Henry's constant (2980 Pa m3/mol), c is the concentration of the gas dissolved in liquid (mol/m3), M is the molecular weight (44.01 kg/kmol), a is the interfacial area per volume (1/m), n is the bubbles per volume (1/m3), and φgis the volume fraction of gas (m3/m3). The mass transfer coefficient (km) was modeled using Higbie's theory and was determined with the following equation [4,25]:(16)km=2Duslipπdbwhere kmis the mass transfer coefficient (m/s), D is the diffusion coefficient (m2/s), uslipis the relative velocity between gas and liquid (m/s), and dbis the gas bubble diameter (m).This study employed the population balance equation to model the growth of the gas bubbles growth in the carbonating tank with the assumption that the bubbles cannot be split or merge, while their size could vary. The governing equation for the gas bubbles population balance is as follows:(17)∂n∂t+∇·(nug)=0where n is the bubbles per volume (1/m3), and ugis the gas velocity (m/s).The transport equation for the gas concentration is expressed below.(18)∂c∂t+∇c·ul=∇·(D∇c)+mglMwhere D is the diffusion coefficient (m2/s), and c is the dissolved gas concentration in liquid (mol/m3). The diffusion coefficient was evaluated with the following equation:(19)D=μTρlwhere μTis the turbulent viscosity (Pa s), and ρlis the liquid density (kg/m3).This study used the commercial code COMSOL-Multiphysics (V 4.3) to model the bubbly flow mixing in the carbonating tank. Three carbonating tank models (i.e., models A, B, and C) were concurrently simulated using the k–ε turbulence model with additional source terms (i.e., turbulent bubbly flow module) and transport equations for dissolved gas (i.e., transport of diluted species module). A time-dependent solver was employed to simulate the two-phase flow with a mass transfer for 500 s and at a time step of 0.01 s. Models A and B were discretized using a free triangular mesh type with 78714 elements. By contrast, model C was discretized with 74270 mesh elements. All computations were performed on an Intel Core i7-3370 3.90 GHz processor with a 16 GB RAM operating system.
