Among the various critical systems that are worth to be formally analyzed, a wide set consists of controllers for dynamical systems. Those programs typically execute an infinite loop in which simple computations update internal states and produce commands to update the system state. Those systems are yet hardly analyzable by available static analysis method, since, even if performing mainly linear computations, the computation of a safe set of reachable states often requires quadratic invariants.In this paper we consider the general setting of a piecewise affine program; that is a program performing different affine updates on the system depending on some conditions. This typically encompasses linear controllers with saturations or controllers with different behaviors and performances activated on some safety conditions.Our analysis is inspired by works performed a decade ago by Johansson et al., and Morari et al., in the control community. We adapted their method focused on the analysis of stability in continuous-time or discrete-time settings to fit the static analysis paradigm and the computation of invariants, that is over-approximation of reachable sets using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions.This approach has been further extended to consider k-inductive properties of reachable traces (trajectories) of systems.The analysis has been implemented in Matlab and shown very good experimental results on a very large set of synthesized problems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the success of Astrée [4], static analysis in general and abstract interpretation in particular are now seriously considered by industrials from the critical embedded system community, and more specifically by the engineers developing and validating controllers. The certification norms concerning the V&V of those software have also evolved and now enable the use of such methods in the development process.These controller software are meant to perform an infinite loop in which values of sensors are read, a function of inputs and internal states is computed, and the value of the result is sent to actuators. In general, in the most critical applications, the controllers used are based on a simple linear update with minor non-linearities such as saturations, i.e. enforcing bounds, or specific behaviors when some conditions are met. The controlled systems range from aircraft flight commands, guidance algorithms, engine control from any kind of device optimizing performance or fuel efficiency, control of railway infrastructure, fan control in tunnels, etc.It is therefore of utmost importance to provide suitable analyses to verify these controllers. One of the approaches is to rely on quadratic invariants, such as the digital filters abstract domain of Feret [10], since, according to Lyapunov׳s theorem, any globally asymptotically stable linear system admits a quadratic Lyapunov function. Unfortunately, this theorem does not hold in the presence of disjunction, such as saturation. Moreover checking stability of piecewise systems is undecidable [25].In static analysis, dealing with disjunction is an import concern. When the join of two abstract element is imprecise, one can consider the disjunctive completion of the domain [11]. This process enriches the set of abstract elements with new ones, but the cost, i.e. the number of new elements, could be exponential in the number of initial elements. Concerning relation abstract domains, one should mention the tropical polyhedra of Allamigeon [2] in which an abstract element characterizes a finite disjunction of zones [21]. However concerning quadratic properties, no static analysis actually performs the automatic computation of disjunctive quadratic invariants.The goal of this paper is to propose such a computation: produce a disjunctive quadratic invariant as a sub-level of a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function. Because of the undecidability of the problem, this search is heuristic, but shown to perform well in our experiments.
