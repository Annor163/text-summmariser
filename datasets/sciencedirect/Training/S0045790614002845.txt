@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study presents a new weak signal detection method based on the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. The principle of the proposed method is described. A weak signal is detected through the transition from the chaotic to the periodic state. Numerical simulation shows that the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is sensitive to a weak signal under strong noise conditions. Several aspects of the proposed method, including the noise influence, influence of different frequency signals, and influence of the phase shift, are studied in detail. Results indicate that the application of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator to weak signal detection is feasible.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Weak signal detection is a challenging task in signal detection and early machinery fault detection. Conventional detection methods, such as wavelet method, are limited under strong noise conditions. The chaotic oscillator is highly effective in weak signal detection because of its properties of noise immunity and sensitivity to specific frequency signals.The Duffing oscillator is the most frequently used chaotic oscillator for detecting weak signals [1–5]. When the Duffing system is in a critical state, a small perturbation may result in system state changes. The weak signal is often detected through the transition from the chaotic to the periodic state. Although the Duffing oscillator is widely used for weak signal detection, further research is necessary to determine whether other chaotic oscillators are suitable for detecting weak signals [6].The van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is employed to solve physical, engineering, and even biological problems. This oscillator type is a generalization of the classic van der Pol oscillator. The van der Pol–Duffing oscillator without an external force has a rich dynamic behavior [7,8], including chaos and bifurcation.This study focuses on weak signal detection based on the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. First, we analyze the dynamic behavior of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. Second, we realize weak signal detection according to the phase trajectory change of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator from the chaos to the periodic state. Finally, some problems are discussed relative to weak signal detection by the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. This study is the first to use the Van der Pol–Duffing oscillator for weak signal detection. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed method has satisfactory detecting performance.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. Section 3 describes the principle and implementation of weak signal detection using the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator. Section 4 presents the related aspects of the proposed method. Section 5 concludes.The van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is described by the following nonlinear equation [9,10]:(1)x¨-μ(1-x2)ẋ+x+αx3=Fcos(ωt)where μ and α are two positive coefficients; and F and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the external excitation, respectively. Eq. (1) is a generalization of the classic van der Pol oscillator equation.The three equilibrium points of the system in Eq. (1) for F=0 correspond to x+αx3=0, such that we have the fixed points0,--1α,-1α.Assumingẋ=y,we then derive the following:(2)ẋ=yẏ=μ(1-x2)ẋ-x-αx3+Fcos(ωt)Yamapi and Filatrella [10] reported that the driven van der Pol–Duffing oscillator exhibits chaotic behavior with the following parameters: μ=5, α=0.01, ω=2.463.The indicator used to analyze the presence of chaos is the maximum Lyapunov exponent. The relation between the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the amplitude F is shown in Fig. 1. The maximum Lyapunov exponent exhibits both negative and positive (chaotic) behavior. If parameter F varies from small to large, the van der Pol–Duffing system state varies from the chaos (Fig. 2) to the periodic state (Fig. 3).When the nonlinear dynamic system is in critical state, a small external force perturbation of the system may result in a qualitative change in system state [11]. This property can be used for weak signal detection. The criterion for distinguishing the state between periodic and chaotic behavior of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is the maximum Lyapunov exponent combined with the phase diagram.After introducing the noise and to-be-detected weak signal, the van der Pol–Duffing equation is given by(3)ẋ=yẏ=μ(1-x2)ẋ-x-αx3+Fcos(ωt)+F1cos(ω1t+ψ)+n(t)where Fcos(ωt) is a periodic driving force in the oscillator, F1cos(ω1t+ψ) is the to-be-detected periodic signal, and n(t)=σ·ε(t) is Gaussian white noise with a variance of 1 and mean of 0. F1cos(ω1t+ψ)+n(t) is also called external perturbation.If μ and α are fixed as the increasing F value exceeds the threshold Fa, the stated oscillator varies from a chaotic to a periodic motion in the phase space. This study uses a discretized Eq. (3) and solves it using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta algorithm. The iteration step h is 0.01s, total time is 300s, and initial conditions are x0=0.1 and y0=0.1.The characteristic variance of the phase plane trajectory of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator with F is used for weak signal detection. Parameter F is set as slightly less than Fa. The oscillator state with no external perturbation is chaotic motion. When the periodical signal frequency is the same as ω as long as F+F1>Fa, the state of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator changes despite F1 being extremely small. Whether the periodical signal exists with ω frequency can be confirmed by identifying the state transformation.The threshold of the van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is obtained by considering the Lyapunov exponent combined with numerical experiments. Given that h=0.01 and ω=2.463rad/s, the threshold Fais 5.03 with no external perturbation. The phase plane trajectories of the critical state are shown in Fig. 4(a). Gaussian white noise with σ=1 is then added, and the corresponding phase plane trajectories are shown in Fig. 4(b). The corresponding phase plane trajectories with the addition of a weak signal with an amplitude F of 0.01 is shown in Fig. 4(c). The van der Pol–Duffing oscillator is significantly immune to noise and sensitive to the weak periodical signal (Fig. 4).
