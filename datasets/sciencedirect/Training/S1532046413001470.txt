@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) are extensively used in the biomedical domain to support information sharing between software applications. KOSs are proposed covering different, but overlapping subjects, and mappings indicate the semantic relation between concepts from two KOSs. Over time, KOSs change as do the mappings between them. This can result from a new discovery or a revision of existing knowledge which includes corrections of concepts or mappings. Indeed, changes affecting KOS entities may force the underline mappings to be updated in order to ensure their reliability over time. To tackle this open research problem, we study how mappings are affected by KOS evolution. This article presents a detailed descriptive analysis of the impact that changes in KOS have on mappings. As a case study, we use the official mappings established between SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM from 2009 to 2011. Results highlight factors according to which KOS changes in varying degrees influence the evolution of mappings.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) encompass all types of schemes for organising information [1] such as terminologies, taxonomies, classification and ontologies. They comprise properties to make the semantics of the data explicit, and biomedical KOSs like SNOMED CT1www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct.1(Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms) (SCT for short) and ICD-9-CM2www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9cm.htm.2(International Classification of Disease) (ICD for short) are nowadays widely used. They have applications in epidemiology, health management, clinical administration and biomedical and medical decision support systems.The ever-increasing size of the biomedical domain means that software applications must rely on multiple KOSs to ensure optimal coverage of their requirements. To cope with this issue, semantic correspondences, i.e., mappings, are established between various KOSs. The mappings are useful since they can support many applications, such as semantic search services, facilitating information indexing with multiple terminologies [2] or the integration of data from various sources [3]. Fung and Xu [4] highlight the possibility of applications to understand heterogeneous data by interpreting mappings that link two different KOSs. For instance, mappings between SCT and ICD support the classification of data using ICD from clinical records annotated with SCT, which has various benefits [4]. These examples underline the relevance of mappings and justify the need to keep them reliable over time.The highly dynamic nature of medical knowledge makes frequent releases of new KOS versions inevitable [5]. Consequently, atomic and complex changes affecting KOS entities [6] can potentially have a direct impact on existing mappings between these entities and thus on the underlying software applications. In this case, there is a clear need to update mappings every time a KOS evolves [7–9]. A naïve approach would be to re-apply existing matching algorithms [10] considering all entities of both aligned KOSs each time a new version of a KOS is released, but tremendous time and efforts are required to complete and evaluate the resulting mappings. Hence the need for efficient approaches to keeping mappings valid, as mentioned by Saitwal et al. [7]. In our previous work [11] we proposed the DyKOSMap framework for maintaining mappings at KOS evolution time. This approach is predicated on the hypothesis that there is a correlation between changes affecting KOSs’ entities and the evolution of their associated mappings.This article aims to demonstrate through experiments the relationships between changes in entities of a biomedical KOS and the evolution of their associated mappings. In other words, we try to identify which KOS changes are the cause or motivation for adapting the associated mappings. The results can help to provide empirically justified efficient approaches to keep mappings valid. The analyses conducted take the influence of changes in different KOS entities into account (e.g., concepts and their attributes, relationships and change in neighbour concepts). We propose a means of categorising mapping evolution to measure the impact of various types of changes in KOS entities on categorised mappings. The experiments explore various official releases of SCT and ICD and the official mappings established between them.The remainder of this article is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the related work; Section 3 presents the experimental scenario including basic definitions, the method applied as well as the organisation of the experiments conducted; Section 4 describes the findings on the influence of KOS evolution on mapping evolution, while Section 5 presents the results of the analyses regarding the correlation between different mapping change operations; Section 6 raises relevant questions and discusses future work; finally, Section 7 offers the conclusions of the article.
