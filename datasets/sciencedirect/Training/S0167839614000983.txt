@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The purpose of this paper is to present algorithms for computing all the differential geometry properties of non-transversal intersection curves of three parametric hypersurfaces in Euclidean 4-space. For transversal intersections, the tangential direction at an intersection point can be computed by the extension of the vector product of the normal vectors of three hypersurfaces. However, when the three normal vectors are not linearly independent, the tangent direction cannot be determined by this method. If normal vectors of hypersurfaces are parallel (N1=N2=N3) we have tangential intersection, and if normal vectors of hypersurfaces are not parallel but are linearly dependent we have “almost tangential” intersection. In each case, we obtain unit tangent vector (t), principal normal vector (n), binormal vectors (b1,b2) and curvatures (k1,k2,k3) of the intersection curve.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we worked with three parametric hypersurfaces inR4and study the differential geometry properties of their intersection curves. The intersection of the hypersurfaces can be transversal (the normal vectors are linearly independent) and non-transversal (the normal vectors are linearly dependent). In the case of transversal intersection, the tangential direction at an intersection point can be computed simply by vector product of the normal vectors of the hypersurfaces. For that reason, various methods and techniques have been given for computing the differential geometry properties of transversal intersections of surfaces inR3, and of hypersurfaces inR4. However, when the normal vectors are linearly dependent at an intersection point, tangent direction cannot be determined by this method. Because of this, there exists little literature for computing the Frenet apparatus of the non-transversal intersection curves.The geometric properties formulas for parametrically defined curves are well known in the classical literature on differential geometry inR3(do Carmo, 1976; Spivak, 1975; Stoker, 1969; Struik, 1950; Willmore, 1959) and in the contemporary literature on geometric modeling (Farin, 2002; Hoschek and Lasser, 1993; Patrikalakis and Maekawa, 2002). The higher curvatures of curves in Euclidean space can be found in textbooks such as Guggenheimer (1963), Klingenberg (1978), Kühnel (2006), Spivak (1999) and papers such as Esin and Hacısalihoğlu (1986), Gluck (1966).The geometric properties formulas of implicitly defined curves of the transversal intersection can be found in the papers: Willmore describes how to obtain the unit tangent t, the unit principal normal n, and the unit binormal b, as well as the curvature k and the torsion τ of the intersection curve of two implicit surfaces inR3, using the operator△=λdds=(h1∂∂x+h2∂∂y+h3∂∂z), whereh=∇f×∇g(Willmore, 1959). Using the idea of Willmore, Düldül and Akbaba introduce some new operators for finding the Frenet apparatus of the transversal intersection curves of two (three) surfaces (hypersurfaces) in which at least one (hyper)surface is given parametrically (Düldül and Akbaba, 2014). Faux and Pratt give the curvature of an intersection curve of two parametric surfaces (Faux and Pratt, 1981). Hartmann provides formulas for computing the curvature k and geodesic curvatureκgof the intersection curves for all three types of intersection problems inR3(parametric–parametric, implicit–implicit and parametric–implicit), using the Implicit Function Theorem (Hartmann, 1996). Ye and Maekawa provide t, n, b, κ, τ using the vectorα″as linear combinations of the normal vectors of the surfaces andα‴as linear combination of the tangent vector and normal vectors of the surfaces. They also provide an algorithm for the evaluation of higher-order derivatives for transversal as well as tangential intersections for all three types of intersection problems inR3(Ye and Maekawa, 1999). Goldman provides closed formulas for computing the curvature (k) and torsion (τ) of the intersection curve of two implicit surfaces inR3and the curvature (κ) of the intersection curve in(n+1)dimensions (Goldman, 2005). Aléssio provides curvature (k) and torsion (τ) for the transversal intersection of two implicit surfaces, using the Implicit Function Theorem (Aléssio, 2006). Aléssio and Guadalupe present formulas for curvature, geodesic torsion and geodesic curvature for the intersection curve of two spacelike surfaces in the Lorentz–Minkowski 3-space (Aléssio and Guadalupe, 2007). Aléssio derives unit tangent vector (t), normal vector (n), binormal vectors (b1,b2) and curvatures (κ1,κ2,κ3) for the transversal intersections, using the Implicit Function Theorem and the method of X. Ye and T. Maekawa for 4 dimensions (Aléssio, 2009). Düldül provides a method for computing the Frenet vectors and the curvatures of the transversal intersection curve of three parametric hypersurfaces in four-dimensional Euclidean space (Düldül, 2010). Uyar Düldül and Düldül obtain the Frenet apparatus of the transversal intersection of three implicit hypersurfaces by extending the Willmore's method into 4-space (Uyar Düldül and Düldül, 2012). Abdel-All et al. provide a method for computing the Frenet vectors and the curvatures of the transversal intersection curve of implicit–parametric–parametric and implicit–implicit–parametric hypersurfaces in four-dimensional Euclidean space (Abdel-All et al., 2012a). Aléssio obtained the normal curvature (κnfi), the first geodesic curvature (κ1gfi) and the first geodesic torsion (τ1gfi) for the transversal intersection curve ofn−1implicit hypersurfaces inRn(Aléssio, 2012).The geometric properties formulas of implicitly defined curves of non-transversal intersection can be found in the following papers: Kruppa describes that the tangential direction of the intersection curve at a tangential intersection point corresponds to the direction from the intersection point towards the intersection of the Dupin indicatrices of the two surfaces (Kruppa, 1957). Cheng (1989) and Markot and Magedson (1989, 1991) give solutions for parametric surfaces at isolated tangential intersection points, based on the analysis of the plane vector field function defined by the gradient of an oriented distance function of one surface from the other. Ye and Maekawa provide an algorithm for the evaluation of higher-order derivatives for tangential intersections for all three types of intersection problems inR3(Ye and Maekawa, 1999). Abdel-All et al. provide an algorithm for the evaluation of geometry properties for tangential intersections of two implicit surfaces inR3using the implicit function theorem (Abdel-All et al., 2012b).In Section 2, we introduce some notations and reviews of the differential geometry of curves and hypersurfaces. In Section 3, we give the formulas which compute the properties of the non-transversal intersection curve of three parametric hypersurfaces. Finally, as an application of our methods, we give several examples of non-transversal intersection.Definition 2.1Let{e1,e2,e3,e4}be the standard basis of four dimensional Euclidean spaceE4. The ternary product (or vector product) of the vectorsx=∑i=14xiei,y=∑i=14yiei, andz=∑i=14zieiis defined by (Hollasch, 1991; Williams and Stein, 1964)x⊗y⊗z=|e1e2e3e4x1x2x3x4y1y2y3y4z1z2z3z4|.The ternary productx⊗y⊗zyields a vector that is orthogonal to x, y, and z.LetM⊂E4be a regular hypersurface given byR=R(u1,u2,u3)andα:I⊂R→Mbe an arbitrary curve with arc-length parametrization. If{t,n,b1,b2}is the moving Frenet frame along α, then the Frenet formulas are given by (Gluck, 1966)(2.1)t′=k1n,n′=−k1t+k2b1,b1′=−k2n+k3b2,b2′=−k3b1,where t, n,b1, andb2denote the tangent, the principal normal, the first binormal, and the second binormal vector fields;ki(i=1,2,3) are the ith curvature functions of the curve α. Also, since M is regular, the partial derivativesR1,R2,R3are linearly independent at every point of M, i.e.R1⊗R2⊗R3≠0, whereRi=∂R∂ui. Thus, the unit normal vector of M is given byN=R1⊗R2⊗R3‖R1⊗R2⊗R3‖.Using the Frenet formulas, for the derivatives of the curve α, we have(2.2)α′=t,α″=t′=k1n,α‴=−k12t+k1′n+k1k2b1,(2.3)α(4)=−3k1k1′t+(−k13+k1″−k1k22)n+(2k1′k2+k1k2′)b1+k1k2k3b2.Furthermore, the first and the second binormal vectors of the curve are given by (Aléssio, 2009)(2.4)b2=α′⊗α″⊗α‴‖α′⊗α″⊗α‴‖,b1=b2⊗t⊗nand the curvatures are obtained with(2.5)k1=‖α″‖,k2=〈α‴,b1〉k1,k3=〈α(4),b2〉k1k2.On the other hand, since the curveα(s)lies on M, we may writeα(s)=R(u1(s),u2(s),u3(s)). We then have(2.6)α′(s)=∑i=13Riui′,(2.7)α″(s)=∑i=13Riui″+∑i,j=13Rijui′uj′,(2.8)α‴(s)=∑i=13Riui‴+3∑i,j=13Rijui″uj′+∑i,j,k=13Rijkui′uj′uk′,(2.9)α(4)(s)=∑i=13Riui(4)+4∑i,j=13Rijui‴uj′+3∑i,j=13Rijui″uj″+6∑i,j,k=13Rijkui′uj′uk″+∑i,j,k,ℓ=13Rijkℓui′uj′uk′uℓ′,(2.10)α(5)(s)=∑i=13Riui(5)+5∑i,j=13Rijui(4)uj′+10∑i,j=13Rijui‴uj″+10∑i,j,k=13Rijkui‴uj′uk′+15∑i,j,k=13Rijkui″uj″uk′+10∑i,j,k,ℓ=13Rijkℓui′uj′uk″uℓ′+∑i,j,k,ℓ,r=13Rijkℓrui′uj′uk′uℓ′ur′.LetM1,M2, andM3denote regular intersecting hypersurfaces given by parametric equationsR1=R1(u1,u2,u3),R2=R2(v1,v2,v3), andR3=R3(w1,w2,w3), respectively. Then, the unit normal vectors of these hypersurfaces are obtained byNi=R1i⊗R2i⊗R3i‖R1i⊗R2i⊗R3i‖,i=1,2,3.We assume that the intersection of these hypersurfaces is a smooth curveα(s)with arc-length parameter s. Letα(s0)=P. If{N1(P),N2(P),N3(P)}are linearly independent, we have a transversal intersection at P. But, if{N1(P),N2(P),N3(P)}are linearly dependent, then we have non-transversal intersection at P with the following cases:Case 1:N3(P)=aN1(P)+bN2(P)andN1(P)∦N2(P),a,b∈R(almost tangential intersection),Case 2:N1(P)=N2(P)=N3(P)(tangential intersection).Since normal vectors are linearly dependent at P, the method given in Düldül (2010) does not work for this case. Thus, we need to find new method to obtain the curvatures and Frenet vectors of the intersection curve. In order to do this, we give a generalization of the method given by Ye and Maekawa (1999).For the unit tangent vector we have(3.1)t=α′(s)=∑i=13Ri1ui′=∑i=13Ri2vi′=∑i=13Ri3wi′.We may write〈α″,N3〉=〈α″,aN1+bN2〉, i.e.(3.2)∑i,j=13hij3wi′wj′=a∑i,j=13hij1ui′uj′+b∑i,j=13hij2vi′vj′which yields a nonlinear equation with nine unknowns, wherehijk,k=1,2,3denote the second fundamental form coefficients of the hypersurfacesMk. Also, since〈t,N2〉=0, we have∑i=13〈Ri1,N2〉ui′=0in which at least one of the inner product is nonzero. Let〈R31,N2〉≠0. Thus, we have(3.3)u3′=ξ1u1′+ξ2u2′,whereξi=−〈Ri1,N2〉〈R31,N2〉,i=1,2.On the other hand, if we take the dot product of∑i=13Ri1ui′=∑i=13Ri2vi′and∑i=13Ri1ui′=∑i=13Ri3wi′withRj2andRj3,j=1,2,3, respectively, we get∑i=13〈Ri1,Rj2〉ui′=∑i=13gij2vi′and∑i=13〈Ri1,Rj3〉ui′=∑i=13gij3wi′,wheregij2andgij3are the first fundamental form coefficients ofM2andM3, respectively. Hence, representing the unknownsvi′andwi′in terms of linear combinations ofui′, and substituting them into (3.2) yields together with (3.3) a second order equation with respect tou1′andu2′such as(3.4)a11(u1′)2+a12u1′u2′+a22(u2′)2=0.As expressed in Ye and Maekawa (1999), denotingλ=u1′u2′whena11≠0orμ=u2′u1′whena11=0,a22≠0gives usa11λ2+a12λ+a22=0ora12μ+a22μ2=0, respectively. Thus, if we solve λ or μ, we can compute the unit tangent vector as(3.5)t=λ(R11+ξ1R31)+R21+ξ2R31‖λ(R11+ξ1R31)+R21+ξ2R31‖or(3.6)t=R11+ξ1R31+μ(R21+ξ2R31)‖R11+ξ1R31+μ(R21+ξ2R31)‖.As explained in Ye and Maekawa (1999), we have four distinct cases for the solution of (3.4) depending upon the discriminantΔ=a122−4a11a22:1.IfΔ<0, then P is an isolated contact point of the hypersurfaces.IfΔ=0anda112+a122+a222≠0, then the hypersurfaces intersect at P and at its neighborhood.IfΔ>0, then P is a branch point of the intersection curve.Ifa11=a12=a22=0, then the hypersurfaces have contact of at least second order at P.Remark 3.1If we writeu2′=η1u1′+η3u3′instead of (3.3), we obtain the corresponding equation for (3.4) asa11(u1′)2+a12u1′u3′+a22(u3′)2=0. In this case, we can compute the unit tangent vector viat=λ(R11+η1R21)+R31+η3R21‖λ(R11+η1R21)+R31+η3R21‖ort=R11+η1R21+μ(R31+η3R21)‖R11+η1R21+μ(R31+η3R21)‖,whereλ=u1′u3′,μ=u3′u1′andηi=−〈Ri1,N2〉〈R21,N2〉,i=1,3.If we haveu1′=θ2u2′+θ3u3′instead of (3.3), then we obtaina11(u2′)2+a12u2′u3′+a22(u3′)2=0. In this case, the unit tangent vector can be computed byt=λ(R21+θ2R11)+R31+θ3R11‖λ(R21+θ2R11)+R31+θ3R11‖ort=R21+θ2R11+μ(R31+θ3R11)‖R21+θ2R11+μ(R31+θ3R11)‖,whereλ=u2′u3′,μ=u3′u2′andθi=−〈Ri1,N2〉〈R11,N2〉,i=2,3.Now, let us calculate the second order derivative vector of the intersection curve. We have(3.7)t′=α″(s)=∑i=13Ri1ui″+∑i,j=13Rij1ui′uj′=∑i=13Ri2vi″+∑i,j=13Rij2vi′vj′=∑i=13Ri3wi″+∑i,j=13Rij3wi′wj′.Sinceui′are known from (3.5) or (3.6), we must calculateu1″,u2″,u3″to obtainα″.If we take the dot product of both sides of the first equality of (3.7) with t, we obtain a linear equation(3.8)〈t′,t〉=∑i=13〈Ri1,t〉ui″+∑i,j=13〈Rij1,t〉ui′uj′=0depending onui″. The second linear equation is obtained by the dot product of∑i=13Ri1ui″+∑i,j=13Rij1ui′uj′=∑i=13Ri2vi″+∑i,j=13Rij2vi′vj′withN2, i.e.(3.9)∑i=13〈Ri1,N2〉ui″+∑i,j=13〈Rij1,N2〉ui′uj′=∑i,j=13〈Rij2,N2〉vi′vj′.In addition, since〈α‴,N3〉=〈α‴,aN1+bN2〉, using (2.8) yields3∑i,j=13〈Rij3,N3〉wi″wj′+∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk3,N3〉wi′wj′wk′=a(3∑i,j=13〈Rij1,N1〉ui″uj′+∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk1,N1〉ui′uj′uk′)+b(3∑i,j=13〈Rij2,N2〉vi″vj′+∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk2,N2〉vi′vj′vk′).As in the previous section, we can representvi″andwi″,i=1,2,3in terms of linear combinations ofui″. Hence, substituting the results into the last equation gives us the third linear equation depending onu1″,u2″,u3″. So, if the obtained linear system with three unknowns has nonzero coefficients determinant, then we can find the curvature vectorα″after solving this system. Thus, the first curvature is obtained byk1=‖α″‖and the principal normal vector is given byn=α″k1.Remark 3.2If the equation〈α‴,N3〉=〈α‴,aN1+bN2〉vanishes, (3.8) and (3.9) constitute a linear equation system whose coefficients matrix has rank 2. In this case, we can solve two unknowns by means of the third one. The third one can be obtained by(3.10)〈α″,N3′〉=〈α″,aN1′+bN2′〉or〈α″,N3″〉=〈α″,aN1″+bN2″〉which are obtained by differentiating〈α″,N3〉=〈α″,aN1+bN2〉with respect to s.If we compute the third order derivative vector of the intersection curve, we can find the first and the second binormal vectors at P. Thus, the second curvature can be obtained.If we use (2.8), we may write(3.11)∑i=13Ri1ui‴+3∑i,j=13Rij1ui″uj′+∑i,j,k=13Rijk1ui′uj′uk′=∑i=13Ri2vi‴+3∑i,j=13Rij2vi″vj′+∑i,j,k=13Rijk2vi′vj′vk′and(3.12)∑i=13Ri1ui‴+3∑i,j=13Rij1ui″uj′+∑i,j,k=13Rijk1ui′uj′uk′=∑i=13Ri3wi‴+3∑i,j=13Rij3wi″wj′+∑i,j,k=13Rijk3wi′wj′wk′from which we can representvi‴andwi‴in terms of linear combinations ofui‴. If we take the dot product of both sides of (3.11) withN2, we get(3.13)∑i=13〈Ri1,N2〉ui‴+3∑i,j=13〈Rij1,N2〉ui″uj′+∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk1,N2〉ui′uj′uk′=3∑i,j=13〈Rij2,N2〉vi″vj′+∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk2,N2〉vi′vj′vk′.On the other hand, differentiating〈α′,α″〉=0gives us〈α‴,t〉=−k12, i.e.(3.14)∑i=13〈Ri1,t〉ui‴+3∑i,j=13〈Rij1,t〉ui″uj′+∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk1,t〉ui′uj′uk′=−k12.Finally, if we use〈α(4),N3〉=〈α(4),aN1+bN2〉, we get4∑i,j=13〈Rij3,N3〉wi‴wj′+3∑i,j=13〈Rij3,N3〉wi″wj″+6∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk3,N3〉wi′wj′wk″+∑i,j,k,ℓ=13〈Rijkℓ3,N3〉wi′wj′wk′wℓ′=a(4∑i,j=13〈Rij1,N1〉ui‴uj′+3∑i,j=13〈Rij1,N1〉ui″uj″+6∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk1,N1〉ui′uj′uk″+∑i,j,k,ℓ=13〈Rijkℓ1,N1〉ui′uj′uk′uℓ′)+b(4∑i,j=13〈Rij2,N2〉vi‴vj′+3∑i,j=13〈Rij2,N2〉vi″vj″+6∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk2,N2〉vi′vj′vk″+∑i,j,k,ℓ=13〈Rijkℓ2,N2〉vi′vj′vk′vℓ′).The last equation together with (3.13), (3.14) constitutes a linear system with three unknownsu1‴,u2‴,u3‴. If this system has nonzero coefficient determinant, we can findu1‴,u2‴,u3‴which enable us to compute the third order derivative vector of the intersection curve. Hence, using (2.4) we getb1,b2and using (2.5) we find the second curvature. Also, by using (2.2) we obtaink1′=〈α‴,n〉.Remark 3.3If the equation〈α(4),N3〉=〈α(4),aN1+bN2〉vanishes, similar to the previous case, this equation is replaced with(3.15)〈α‴,N3(i)〉=〈α‴,aN1(i)+bN2(i)〉,i=1,2,3.Lastly, let us now find the fourth order derivative vector and the third curvature of the intersection curve.As expressed in the previous section, we can representvi(4)andwi(4)in terms of linear combinations ofui(4)by using (2.9). If we take the dot product of both sides of∑i=13Ri1ui(4)+4∑i,j=13Rij1ui‴uj′+3∑i,j=13Rij1ui″uj″+6∑i,j,k=13Rijk1ui′uj′uk″+∑i,j,k,ℓ=13Rijkℓ1ui′uj′uk′uℓ′=∑i=13Ri2vi(4)+4∑i,j=13Rij2vi‴vj′+3∑i,j=13Rij2vi″vj″+6∑i,j,k=13Rijk2vi′vj′vk″+∑i,j,k,ℓ=13Rijkℓ2vi′vj′vk′vℓ′withN2, we get a linear equation(3.16)∑i=13〈Ri1,N2〉ui(4)+4∑i,j=13〈Rij1,N2〉ui‴uj′+3∑i,j=13〈Rij1,N2〉ui″uj″+6∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk1,N2〉ui′uj′uk″+∑i,j,k,ℓ=13〈Rijkℓ1,N2〉ui′uj′uk′uℓ′=4∑i,j=13〈Rij2,N2〉vi‴vj′+3∑i,j=13〈Rij2,N2〉vi″vj″+6∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk2,N2〉vi′vj′vk″+∑i,j,k,ℓ=13〈Rijkℓ2,N2〉vi′vj′vk′vℓ′depending onu1(4),u2(4),u3(4).On the other hand, differentiating〈α‴,t〉=−k12yields the second equation as〈α(4),t〉=−3k1k1′, i.e.(3.17)∑i=13〈Ri1,t〉ui(4)+4∑i,j=13〈Rij1,t〉ui‴uj′+3∑i,j=13〈Rij1,t〉ui″uj″+6∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk1,t〉ui′uj′uk″+∑i,j,k,ℓ=13〈Rijkℓ1,t〉ui′uj′uk′uℓ′=−3k1k1′.The third linear equation comes from〈α(5),N3〉=〈α(5),aN1+bN2〉.If the obtained linear system with three unknownsu1(4),u2(4),u3(4)has nonzero coefficient determinant, we can findu1(4),u2(4),u3(4)which enable us to compute the fourth order derivative vector from (2.9) and the third curvature from (2.5) of the intersection curve.Remark 3.4If the equation〈α(5),N3〉=〈α(5),aN1+bN2〉vanishes, this equation is replaced with(3.18)〈α(4),N3(i)〉=〈α(4),aN1(i)+bN2(i)〉,i=1,2,3,4.Let us now assume thatN1(P)=N2(P)=N3(P). Calculating the curvatures and Frenet vectors in this case is more difficult than Case 1.If we consider the linear combinations ofvi′andwi′in terms ofui′(i=1,2,3) obtained from (3.1), we get three nonlinear equations depending onui′by using the following equalities:(3.19){〈α″,N1〉=〈α″,N2〉,〈α″,N1〉=〈α″,N3〉,〈α′,α′〉=1.Let us denote the first two equations with(3.20){c1(u1′)2+c2(u2′)2+c3(u3′)2+c4u1′u2′+c5u1′u3′+c6u2′u3′=0,d1(u1′)2+d2(u2′)2+d3(u3′)2+d4u1′u2′+d5u1′u3′+d6u2′u3′=0,respectively, whereci,di(i=1,2,...,6) are scalars. If we denote(3.21)ρ=u2′u1′,σ=u3′u1′whenδ1=|c2c3d2d3|≠0,or(3.22)ρ=u1′u2′,σ=u3′u2′whenδ2=|c1c3d1d3|≠0,or(3.23)ρ=u1′u3′,σ=u2′u3′whenδ3=|c1c2d1d2|≠0,we obtain(3.24){c2ρ2+c6ρσ+c3σ2+c4ρ+c5σ+c1=0,d2ρ2+d6ρσ+d3σ2+d4ρ+d5σ+d1=0,or(3.25){c1ρ2+c5ρσ+c3σ2+c4ρ+c6σ+c2=0,d1ρ2+d5ρσ+d3σ2+d4ρ+d6σ+d2=0,or(3.26){c1ρ2+c4ρσ+c2σ2+c5ρ+c6σ+c3=0,d1ρ2+d4ρσ+d2σ2+d5ρ+d6σ+d3=0,respectively, i.e. we have pairs of conics with respect to ρ and σ. The intersection points(ρ,σ)of these conics can be found by substitution method or pencil of conics (or any other methods such as Sylvester resultants etc.). Thus, the unit tangent vector of the tangential intersection curve can be found by(3.27)t=R11+ρR21+σR31‖R11+ρR21+σR31‖,or(3.28)t=ρR11+R21+σR31‖ρR11+R21+σR31‖,or(3.29)t=ρR11+σR21+R31‖ρR11+σR21+R31‖,respectively.We have the following cases depending upon the number of the real intersection points of the conic pairs given above:1)If the obtained conics do not have any common point, then P is an isolated contact point of the hypersurfaces.If the obtained conics have one point in common, then t is unique.If the obtained conics have two, three or four points in common, then P is a branch point.If the obtained conics overlap, then P is a higher-order contact point.If∑i=16(ci2+di2)=0, then (3.20) vanishes for any values ofu1′,u2′andu3′, i.e. P is a higher order contact point. If the all second fundamental form coefficients of the hypersurfaces vanish at P, then P is a flat point of the hypersurfaces. Thus, the hypersurfaces have at least second order contact at P.If∃δi≠0,i=1,2,3, then we can use this method. But, if∑i=16(ci2+di2)≠0andδ1=δ2=δ3=0, then t may not be available (see Example 4.4).Now, let us find the curvature vectorα″of the intersection curve at P. To do this, we need to calculateu1″,u2″,u3″. If we use the expressions of the curvature vector given in (3.7), we can representvi″andwi″in terms of linear combinations ofui″,i=1,2,3. Thus, sinceN1=N2=N3at P and the curvature vector is perpendicular to t,(3.30){〈α‴,N1〉=〈α‴,N2〉,〈α‴,N1〉=〈α‴,N3〉,〈α′,α″〉=0or(3.31){3∑i,j=13〈Rij1,N1〉ui″uj′−3∑i,j=13〈Rij2,N2〉vi″vj′=∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk2,N2〉vi′vj′vk′−∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk1,N1〉ui′uj′uk′,3∑i,j=13〈Rij1,N1〉ui″uj′−3∑i,j=13〈Rij3,N3〉wi″wj′=∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk3,N3〉wi′wj′wk′−∑i,j,k=13〈Rijk1,N1〉ui′uj′uk′,∑i,k=13〈Ri1,Rk1〉ui″uk′=−∑i,j,k=13〈Rij1,Rk1〉ui′uj′uk′yield us three linear equations depending onui″. If the coefficients determinant of this linear system is nonzero, then we can find the unknownsu1″,u2″,u3″. Substituting the results into (3.7) gives us the curvature vector. Thus, the first curvature is obtained from (2.5), and n,k1′can be found from (2.2).Remark 3.6If the coefficients determinant of (3.31) is zero, then at least one of the first two equations of (3.31) either vanishes or has proportional coefficients with the other equation. Let us assume that〈α‴,N1〉=〈α‴,N2〉vanishes or has proportional coefficients with the second equation. In this case, differentiating〈α″,N1〉=〈α″,N2〉with respect to s gives〈α″,N1′〉=〈α″,N2′〉, and differentiating the last equation again yields〈α″,N1″〉=〈α″,N2″〉at P. Hence,u1″,u2″,u3″can be found by(3.32){〈α″,N1′〉=〈α″,N2′〉,〈α‴,N1〉=〈α‴,N3〉,〈α′,α″〉=0or{〈α″,N1″〉=〈α″,N2″〉,〈α‴,N1〉=〈α‴,N3〉,〈α′,α″〉=0.If the first two equations of (3.31) both vanish, by similar argument,u1″,u2″,u3″can be found by(3.33){〈α″,N1′〉=〈α″,N2′〉,〈α″,N1′〉=〈α″,N3′〉,〈α′,α″〉=0or{〈α″,N1″〉=〈α″,N2″〉,〈α″,N1″〉=〈α″,N3″〉,〈α′,α″〉=0.Now, let us find the third order derivative vectorα‴of the intersection curve at P. To do this, we need to calculateu1‴,u2‴,u3‴. If we use the equations given in (3.11) and (3.12), we can representvi‴andwi‴in terms of linear combinations ofui‴,i=1,2,3. Substituting these linear combinations into(3.34){〈α(4),N1〉=〈α(4),N2〉,〈α(4),N1〉=〈α(4),N3〉gives us two linear equations depending onu1‴,u2‴,u3‴. Since〈α′,α″〉=0, differentiating with respect to s yields the third linear equation as(3.35)〈α′,α‴〉=−k12.If (3.34) and (3.35) constitute a linear equation system with nonvanishing coefficients determinant, we can findui‴. Thus, the third order derivative vector of the tangential intersection curve can be found by (2.8). So, using (2.4) and (2.5) we obtain the second and first binormal vectors and the second curvature.Remark 3.7If the coefficients determinant of the linear system (3.34), (3.35) is zero, then similar to the previous case,u1‴,u2‴,u3‴can be found by(3.36){〈α‴,N1(i)〉=〈α‴,N2(i)〉,〈α(4),N1〉=〈α(4),N3〉,〈α′,α‴〉=−k12,or{〈α(4),N1〉=〈α(4),N2〉,〈α‴,N1(i)〉=〈α‴,N3(i)〉,〈α′,α‴〉=−k12,i=1,2,3.If the two equations in (3.34) both vanish,ui‴can be obtained by(3.37){〈α‴,N1(i)〉=〈α‴,N2(i)〉,〈α‴,N1(i)〉=〈α‴,N3(i)〉,〈α′,α‴〉=−k12,i=1,2,3.Finally, to find the third curvature of the tangential intersection curve, we need to find the fourth order derivative vectorα(4), i.e.ui(4),i=1,2,3. We can representvi(4)andwi(4)in terms of the linear combinations ofui(4),i=1,2,3by using (2.9). Substituting these linear combinations into(3.38){〈α(5),N1〉=〈α(5),N2〉,〈α(5),N1〉=〈α(5),N3〉gives us two linear equations depending onu1(4),u2(4),u3(4). Also, if we use (2.2) and (2.3), we obtain the third linear equation depending onui(4)as(3.39)〈α′,α(4)〉=−3k1k1′.If the linear system (3.38)–(3.39) has a nonzero coefficients determinant, we getui(4). The fourth order derivative vector of the tangential intersection curve can be found by (2.9). So, using (2.5) we can find the third curvature.Remark 3.8If the coefficients determinant of the linear system (3.38), (3.39) is zero, then similar to the previous cases,u1(4),u2(4),u3(4)can be found by(3.40){〈α(4),N1(i)〉=〈α(4),N2(i)〉,〈α(5),N1〉=〈α(5),N3〉,〈α′,α(4)〉=−3k1k1′,or{〈α(5),N1〉=〈α(5),N2〉,〈α(4),N1(i)〉=〈α(4),N3(i)〉,〈α′,α(4)〉=−3k1k1′,i=1,2,3,4.If the two equations in (3.38) both vanish,ui(4)can be obtained by(3.41){〈α(4),N1(i)〉=〈α(4),N2(i)〉,〈α(4),N1(i)〉=〈α(4),N3(i)〉,〈α′,α(4)〉=−3k1k1′,i=1,2,3,4.Let us consider the hypersurfacesM1,M2, andM3given by the parametric equationsR1(u1,u2,u3)=(12+12cos⁡u1,12sin⁡u1,u2,u3),R2(v1,v2,v3)=(v1,v2,v3,v12+v22+v32),R3(w1,w2,w3)=(w1,w2,w3,2−w12−w22−w32)respectively, and find the Frenet vectors and the curvatures of their intersection curve atP=R1(0,0,1)=R2(1,0,0)=R3(1,0,0)=(1,0,0,1).The unit normal vectors of these hypersurfaces at P are, respectively,N1=(1,0,0,0),N2=(25,0,0,−15),N3=(−25,0,0,−15).Hence,N3=−45N1+N2, i.e.a=−45,b=1. Also,ξ1=ξ2=0and the non-vanishing second fundamental form coefficients at P areh111=−12,h112=h222=h332=−25,h113=h223=h333=25.Using (3.1) we may writet=(0,12u1′,u2′,u3′)=(v1′,v2′,v3′,2v1′)=(w1′,w2′,w3′,−2w1′)and according to (3.2) we have(w1′)2+(w2′)2+(w3′)2=(u1′)2−(v1′)2−(v2′)2−(v3′)2.Substitutingv1′=w1′=0,v2′=w2′=12u1′,v3′=w3′=u2′into the last equation yields−(u1′)2+4(u2′)2=0,i.e.−λ2+4=0. Then,Δ=16>0, that is, P is a branch point andλ=±2. Thus, if we takeλ=2, from (3.5) we obtain the unit tangent vector at P ast=2R11+R21‖2R11+R21‖=(0,12,12,0).We then have at Pu1′=2,u2′=12,u3′=0,v1′=0,v2′=12,v3′=12,w1′=0,w2′=12,w3′=12.For the second and third order derivative vectors of the intersection curve, we may writeα″=(−1,12u1″,u2″,u3″)=(v1″,v2″,v3″,2v1″+2)=(w1″,w2″,w3″,−2w1″−2),α‴=(−32u1″,12u1‴−2,u2‴,u3‴)=(v1‴,v2‴,v3‴,2v1‴+32v2″+32v3″)=(w1‴,w2‴,w3‴,−2w1‴−32w2″−32w3″).If we substitute the known results into (3.8) and (3.9), we obtain the linear equations depending onu1″,u2″,u3″asu1″+2u2″=0,u3″=0,−u1″+2u2″=0which yieldu1″=u2″=u3″=0. So,α″=(−1,0,0,0)andv1″=w1″=−1,v2″=v3″=w2″=w3″=0. The first curvature isk1=1and the principal normal vector isn=(−1,0,0,0).Similarly, we haveα(4)=(−22u1‴+2,12u1(4),u2(4),u3(4))=(v1(4),v2(4),v3(4),2v1(4)+42v2‴+42v3‴+6)=(w1(4),w2(4),w3(4),−2w1(4)−42w2‴−42w3‴−6)and obtain the linear equations depending onu1‴,u2‴,u3‴asu3‴=0,u1‴+2u2‴=0,−2u1‴+22u2‴=−1.Solving this system givesu1‴=24,u2‴=−28,u3‴=0. Thus,α‴=(0,−728,−28,0),k1′=0,v1‴=w1‴=0,v2‴=w2‴=−728,v3‴=w3‴=−28.Also, from (2.4) we findb2=(0,0,0,−1),b1=(0,12,−12,0).So, the second curvature is obtained ask2=−34.Finally, the linear equation system depending onu1(4),u2(4),u3(4)is obtained asu3(4)=0,u1(4)+2u2(4)=0,−u1(4)+2u2(4)=0which has the solutionu1(4)=u2(4)=u3(4)=0. Hence, we find the fourth order derivative vector of the intersection curve asα(4)=(1,0,0,0)and the third curvature ask3=0.If we takeλ=−2, we obtain the unit tangent vector of the other intersection curve passing through the point P.Let us now consider the hypersurfacesM1,M2, andM3given byR1(u1,u2,u3)=(sin⁡u3sin⁡u2cos⁡u1,sin⁡u3sin⁡u2sin⁡u1,sin⁡u3cos⁡u2,cos⁡u3),R2(v1,v2,v3)=(cosh⁡v3cos⁡v2cos⁡v1,cosh⁡v3cos⁡v2sin⁡v1,cosh⁡v3sin⁡v2,sinh⁡v3),R3(w1,w2,w3)=(12+12cos⁡w1,12sin⁡w1,w2,w3)respectively, and find the Frenet vectors and the curvatures of their intersection curve atP=R1(0,π2,π2)=R2(0,0,0)=R3(0,0,0)=(1,0,0,0).The unit normal vectors of these hypersurfaces at P areN1=N2=N3=(1,0,0,0).Hence, the intersection at P is tangential intersection. The non-vanishing second fundamental form coefficients of these hypersurfaces areh111=h221=h331=−1,h112=h222=−1,h332=1,h113=−12.If we use (3.1), we havet=(0,u1′,−u2′,−u3′)=(0,v1′,v2′,v3′)=(0,12w1′,w2′,w3′),and from (3.19) we obtain(4.1){−(u1′)2−(u2′)2−(u3′)2=−(v1′)2−(v2′)2+(v3′)2,−(u1′)2−(u2′)2−(u3′)2=−12(w1′)2.Substitutingv1′=u1′,w1′=2u1′,v2′=w2′=−u2′,v3′=w3′=−u3′into (4.1) yields{(u3′)2=0,(u1′)2−(u2′)2−(u3′)2=0.Sinceδ1=|01−1−1|≠0, by takingρ=u2′u1′,σ=u3′u1′, we obtain{σ2=0,−ρ2−σ2+1=0,that is,σ=0,ρ=±1. Thus, since the obtained conics have two intersection points, P is a branch point. So, the tangent vectors of the intersection curves at P are obtained from (3.27) ast=R11±R21‖R11±R21‖=(0,12,±12,0).Let us chooset=(0,12,12,0). This gives usu1′=12,u2′=−12,u3′=0,v1′=12,v2′=12,v3′=0,w1′=2,w2′=12,w3′=0at the point P. For the second order derivative vector of the intersection curve, we may writeα″=(−1,u1″,−u2″,−u3″)=(−1,v1″,v2″,v3″)=(−1,12w1″,w2″,w3″).From (3.31) we obtain{−u1″+u2″=−v1″−v2″,−u1″+u2″=−w1″,u1″−u2″=0,or{−u1″+u2″=−u1″+u2″,−u1″+u2″=−2u1″,u1″−u2″=0,i.e.〈α‴,N1〉=〈α‴,N2〉vanishes. SinceN1=(sin⁡u3sin⁡u2cos⁡u1,sin⁡u3sin⁡u2sin⁡u1,sin⁡u3cos⁡u2,cos⁡u3),N2=(1+2sinh2⁡v3)−12(−sin⁡v1cos⁡v2cosh⁡v3,cos⁡v1cos⁡v2cosh⁡v3,sin⁡v2cosh⁡v3,−sinh⁡v3),we haveN1′=N2′=(0,12,12,0)andN1″=(−1,u1″,−u2″,−u3″),N2″=(−1,v1″,v2″,−v3″)at P. Hence, if we use (3.32), we get{1+(u1″)2+(u2″)2+(u3″)2=1+(v1″)2+(v2″)2−(v3″)2,−u1″+u2″=−w1″,u1″−u2″=0,that is,u1″=u2″=u3″=0. In this case, the curvature vector at P isα″=(−1,0,0,0)and the first curvature of the tangential intersection curve isk1=1. Also, the principal normal vector isn=(−1,0,0,0). For the third order derivative vector of the intersection curve, we haveα‴=(0,u1‴−2,−u2‴−122,−u3‴)=(0,v1‴−2,v2‴−122,v3‴)=(0,12w1‴−2,w2‴,w3‴).From (3.34) and (3.35) we get{〈α(4),N1〉=〈α(4),N2〉⇒−22u1‴+22u2‴+2=−22v1‴−22v2‴+2,〈α(4),N1〉=〈α(4),N3〉⇒−22u1‴+22u2‴+2=−22w1‴+2,〈α′,α‴〉=−k12⇒12u1‴−12u2‴=14.It is seen that〈α(4),N1〉=〈α(4),N2〉vanishes. SinceN1′=N2′=(0,12,12,0),N1″=N2″=(−1,0,0,0)andN1‴=(0,u1‴−2,−u2‴−122,−u3‴),N2‴=(0,v1‴−2,v2‴−122,−v3‴)at P, using (3.36) withi=3gives us{(u1‴−2)2+(−u2‴−122)2+(u3‴)2=(v1‴−2)2+(v2‴−122)2−(v3‴)2,−22u1‴+22u2‴+2=−22w1‴+2,12u1‴−12u2‴=14,i.e.u1‴=28,u2‴=−28,u3‴=0. Hence,α‴=(0,−728,−28,0)andk1′=〈α‴,n〉=0.For the fourth order derivative vector of the intersection curve, we may writeα(4)=(1,u1(4),−u2(4),−u3(4))=(1,v1(4),v2(4),v3(4))=(1,12w1(4),w2(4),w3(4)).Thus, from (3.38) and (3.39) we obtain{〈α(5),N1〉=〈α(5),N2〉⇒−12u1(4)+12u2(4)=−12v1(4)−12v2(4),〈α(5),N1〉=〈α(5),N3〉⇒−12u1(4)+12u2(4)=−12w1(4),〈α′,α(4)〉=−3k1k1′⇒12u1(4)−12u2(4)=0i.e.〈α(5),N1〉=〈α(5),N2〉vanishes. SinceN1‴=N2‴=(0,−728,−28,0)andN1(4)=(1,u1(4),−u2(4),−u3(4)),N2(4)=(1,v1(4),v2(4),−v3(4))at P, using (3.40) withi=4yields{〈α(4),N1(4)〉=〈α(4),N2(4)〉⇒1+(u1(4))2+(u2(4))2+(u3(4))2=1+(v1(4))2+(v2(4))2−(v3(4))2,〈α(5),N1〉=〈α(5),N3〉⇒−12u1(4)+12u2(4)=−12w1(4),〈α′,α(4)〉=−3k1k1′⇒12u1(4)−12u2(4)=0.The solution of this system isu1(4)=u2(4)=u3(4)=0which givesα(4)=(1,0,0,0). Hence, if we use (2.4), the second and the first binormal vectors of the tangential intersection curve at P is obtained asb2=(0,0,0,1)andb1=(0,−12,12,0), respectively. Thus, (2.5) gives the second and third curvatures ask2=34,k3=0.Let us consider the hypersurfacesM1,M2, andM3with their parametric equationsR1(u1,u2,u3)=(sin⁡u3sin⁡u2cos⁡u1,sin⁡u3sin⁡u2sin⁡u1,sin⁡u3cos⁡u2,cos⁡u3),R2(v1,v2,v3)=(cos⁡v1,sin⁡v1,v2,v3),R3(w1,w2,w3)=(1,w1,w2,w3)respectively, and find the Frenet vectors and the curvatures of their intersection curve atP=R1(0,π2,π2)=R2(0,0,0)=R3(0,0,0)=(1,0,0,0).The unit normal vectors of these hypersurfaces at P areN1=N2=N3=(1,0,0,0),and the non-vanishing second fundamental form coefficients areh111=h221=h331=−1,h112=−1.Also, we haveα′=(0,u1′,−u2′,−u3′)=(0,v1′,v2′,v3′)=(0,w1′,w2′,w3′).Hence, from (3.19) we get{−(u1′)2−(u2′)2−(u3′)2=−(v1′)2,−(u1′)2−(u2′)2−(u3′)2=0⇒{(u2′)2+(u3′)2=0,(u1′)2+(u2′)2+(u3′)2=0.Then, we haveδ3=|0111|≠0. By takingρ=u1′u3′,σ=u2′u3′, we obtain{σ2+1=0,ρ2+σ2+1=0.Since there are no real points of intersection, P is an isolated contact point of the hypersurfaces.Let the hypersurfacesM1,M2, andM3be given by the parametric equationsR1(u1,u2,u3)=(u1,u2,u3,u1u2),R2(v1,v2,v3)=(v1,v2,v3,v2v3),R3(w1,w2,w3)=(w1,w2,w3,w33)respectively, and let us find the Frenet vectors and the curvatures of their intersection curve atP=R1(0,0,0)=R2(0,0,0)=R3(0,0,0)=(0,0,0,0).The unit normal vectors of these hypersurfaces at P areN1=N2=N3=(0,0,0,−1), and the non-vanishing second fundamental form coefficients areh121=h211=−1,h232=h322=−1. Also, we haveα′=(u1′,u2′,u3′,0)=(v1′,v2′,v3′,0)=(w1′,w2′,w3′,0).Hence, from (3.19) we get{−2u1′u2′=−2v2′v3′,−2u1′u2′=0⇒{u1′u2′−u2′u3′=0,u1′u2′=0.Since∑i=16(ci2+di2)≠0andδ1=δ2=δ3=0, t is not available.Let us consider the hypersurfacesM1,M2, andM3with their parametric equationsR1(u1,u2,u3)=(u13,u1,u2,u3),R2(v1,v2,v3)=(v23,v1,v2,v3),R3(w1,w2,w3)=(w33,w1,w2,w3)respectively. The unit normal vector fields of these hypersurfaces areN1=11+9u14(1,−3u12,0,0),N2=11+9v24(1,0,−3v22,0),N3=11+9w34(1,0,0,−3w32),i.e. they intersect tangentially at the pointP=R1(0,0,0)=R2(0,0,0)=R3(0,0,0)=(0,0,0,0).Since all the second fundamental form coefficients of these hypersurfaces are zero at P, (3.20) vanishes.We haveα′=(0,u1′,u2′,u3′)=(0,v1′,v2′,v3′)=(0,w1′,w2′,w3′),and alsoN1′=N2′=N3′=0,N1″=(0,−6(u1′)2,0,0),N2″=(0,0,−6(v2′)2,0),N3″=(0,0,0,−6(w3′)2)at P. Thus, we obtain{〈α′,N1″〉=〈α′,N2″〉,〈α′,N1″〉=〈α′,N3″〉⇒{(u1′)3=(u2′)3,(u1′)3=(u3′)3.Substitutingu1′=u2′=u3′into〈α′,α′〉=1yieldsu1′=u2′=u3′=13, i.e.α′=(0,13,13,13).We have, for the second and third order derivative vectors of the intersection curve,α″=(0,u1″,u2″,u3″)=(0,v1″,v2″,v3″)=(0,w1″,w2″,w3″),α‴=(23,u1‴,u2‴,u3‴)=(23,v1‴,v2‴,v3‴)=(23,w1‴,w2‴,w3‴).Since the system{〈α‴,N1〉=〈α‴,N2〉,〈α‴,N1〉=〈α‴,N3〉vanishes, we get{〈α″,N1″〉=〈α″,N2″〉,〈α″,N1″〉=〈α″,N3″〉⇒{u1″=u2″,u1″=u3″.If we substituteu1″=u2″=u3″into〈α′,α″〉=0, then we findu1″=u2″=u3″=0, i.e.α″=0. Thus, the first curvature isk1=0. The Frenet frame at P is then undefined.
