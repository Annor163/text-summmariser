@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Comparison and classification of organisms based on molecular data is an important task of computational biology, since at least parts of DNA sequences for many organisms are available. Unfortunately, methods for comparison are computationally very demanding, suitable only for short sequences. In this paper, we focus on the redundancy of genetic information stored in DNA sequences. We proposed rules for downsampling of DNA signals of cumulated phase. According to the length of an original sequence, we are able to significantly reduce the amount of data with only slight loss of original information. Dyadic wavelet transform was chosen for fast downsampling with minimum influence on signal shape carrying the biological information. We proved the usability of such new short signals by measuring percentage deviation of pairs of original and downsampled signals while maintaining spectral power of signals. Minimal loss of biological information was proved by measuring the Robinson–Foulds distance between pairs of phylogenetic trees reconstructed from the original and downsampled signals. The preservation of inter-species and intra-species information makes these signals suitable for fast sequence identification as well as for more detailed phylogeny reconstruction.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Current DNA, RNA and protein sequence comparison is done especially by character-processing techniques [1]. Multiple sequence alignments and the complexity of the character-based methods (e.g. Maximum Likelihood) limit their use to small dataset [2] only. They do not meet today׳s requirements for processing of large amount of data produced by increasingly cheaper sequencing technologies [3]. It is caused by character-based representation in which we are not able to extract important information for example for auxiliary alignment during multiple sequence alignment of very long sequences or to provide pilot alignment of reads during a de novo assembly process. A different way of how to treat the data is a bioinformatic sub-discipline called genomic signal processing [4]. Character-based representation (A, C, G, and T for nucleotides of DNA) can show only point differences between sequences and it is hard to be read by the human eye. The first signal representations of DNA sequences began to appear right with the onset of Sanger׳s sequencing to show sequence features in the larger scale than only point mutations and to visualize the information for a human eye [5]. Last decade showed that different genomic signals are usable not only for visualization but also for solving various bioinformatic tasks e.g. organism comparison, sequence alignment, gene prediction etc. [6,7] making genomic signal processing part of bioinformatics that is developing very rapidly. Just in the last few months, numerous new signal representations for DNA [8–11] as well as for protein sequences were described [12,13]. The latest results show that genomic signal processing is not only a full-fledged alternative for character based methods but it can even provide analyses that are unable to be done by character-processing techniques e.g. fast whole-genome comparison [14] or construction of guiding tree for multiple sequence alignment.Genomic signal processing techniques for phylogeny reconstruction and sequence comparison can be divided into two groups. The first group of “alignment-free” methods differs substantially from the character based methods. Sequences are compared in pairs according to the difference in characteristic attributes e.g. frequencies of k-mers [15,16] or by using signal processing techniques e.g. Fourier transform (FT) for spectral analysis or dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) for revealing periodicities in DNA [17–19]. Although this approach allows fast long sequence comparison, it suffers from inability to evaluate local differences because the resulting similarity is always global. The second group of “alignment-dependent” methods can compare local differences. Algorithm for pairwise alignment using dynamic time warping (DTW) was described recently [20]. Although these techniques have the same complexity as the corresponding character-based methods, they have an advantage over them by possibility of processing compressed data. Sampling rate of a character sequence is given by a number of the characters and it cannot be reduced, because dropping of character would change a nature of a sequence. Genomic signals can be significantly downsampled without a negative effect on the result of an alignment and a similarity measure, as proved in [14,20]. However, no rule for genomic signal downsampling was given. In this paper, we examined fast algorithm for signal decimation using dyadic wavelet transform (DWT). By measuring information loss according to the level of decimation for sequences of various lengths, we were able to set the rule for downsampling the signal depending on the length of the original sequence. The rule was also verified for loss of biological information using phylogenetic trees. We measured Robinson–Foulds distance of phylogenetic trees reconstructed from original data and downsampled signals. Thus, using computationally undemanding algorithm for downsampling, we are able to reduce the amount of data provided to signal alignment which is computationally demanding NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) problem [21].To examine the possibility of genomic signal downsampling we used a set of 420 sequences divided into 7 groups each of 60 sequences according to their lengths. The shortest sequences of cytochrome c oxidase I (COX1) genes of eukaryotes, commonly used as short barcode sequence for identification of organisms [22], were obtained from Boldsystems database (http://www.boldsystems.org/). Other sequences containing 16S rRNA and complete ACTA1 genes of eukaryotes, whole mitochondrial genomes of eukaryotes, whole genomes of viruses, whole bacterial plasmids and whole bacterial genomes were obtained from GenBank database at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). First two groups contains only coding sequences, other groups contains both, coding and non-coding DNA. Unlike COX1 and 16S rRNA, eukaryotic ACTA1 genes consist of exons and introns. The summary of sequences is given inTable 1.For the biological validation, we used another 2 smaller sets of whole mitochondrial genomes of eukaryotes and whole bacterial genomes obtained from GenBank database. Accession numbers of these sequences are mentioned in Fig. 5.Downsampling techniques are applicable to “alignment dependent” methods. However, not all of the signal representations are suitable for fast comparison equally. Various signals e.g. Z curve [23], DNA walks [24–26] or phase visualizations [27] differ in dimensionality, primary feature representation or species specificity. We used cumulated phase signal representation for several purposes [27], because its’ 1D nature makes it very suitable for alignment and easy to compute with. Also it preserves appropriate features in the large scale and after massive downsampling [14].Sequence conversion is done by projection of nucleotides in the complex plane in the manner such that appropriate complex numbers maintain information on nucleotides׳ chemical similarities: A [1,j], C [−1,−j], G [−1,j], T [1,−j]. Using trigonometric functions, we are able to calculate the phase of these four numbers: {ϕA, ϕC, ϕG, ϕT}={π/4,−3π/4,3π/4,−π/4}. The signal form of a sequence is done by cumulating of nucleotides׳ phase numbers along the sequence [28]. In case of RNA sequences, we treat U as T.This 1D signal is similar to other biological 1D signals e.g. ECG, EEG signals, and can be processed by similar tools, e.g. FT, DWT of DTW. However, several differences can be found. Sampling rate fsof cumulated phase is given by the length of the sequence not by a sensing device. Spectral analysis provided by discrete Fourier transform (DFT) can show possibilities of downsampling by revealing frequency bands carrying the main information. To be able to perform DFT, the signal has to be periodic. The cumulated phase is defined at interval 〈1, N〉, where N is number of nucleotides in the sequence, which could be taken as one period of signal on (−∞,+∞). Discrete spectrum F (k) in the frequency domain has the same length as the signal:(1)DFT{f(n)}=F(k)=∑n=1Nf(n)e−jkΩnT,Sampling rate equal to the sequence length makes direct downsampling problematic for longer sequences, because it increases demands on the antialiasing filter, mainly in terms of length of impulse response. We proposed fast and simple solution based on dyadic wavelet transform (DWT) [14]. However DWT has been previously used for revealing periodicities in DNA [29], it has not been used for DNA signal downsampling to extract large scale feature of cumulated phase signal. Using the relation between correlation and convolution, we can define dyadic wavelet transform for genomic signal as discrete convolution:(2)ym(n)=∑i=−∞∞x(i)hm(2mn−i)=∑i=−∞∞hm(i)x(2mn−i),which represents signal decomposition by a bank of discrete octave filters with impulse responses hm(n) [30]. Then the sampling frequency of signal ym(n) on output of mthfilter is 2mtimes lower than the sampling rate fsof the input signal x(n). Using the Haar wavelets standing for 2 filters, with short impulse responses hh(n)={−0.7071; 0.7071} and hd(n)={0.7071; 0.7071}, makes downsampling very fast. Such a short impulse response also minimalizes delays that may affect the signal shape in an inappropriate way, e.g. rounding peaks, original shape deformation.The preservation of signal information was measured as percentage root-mean-square difference (PRD) between the original and the downsampled signal that was again resampled to the initial sampling rate:(3)PRD=∑i=1n(x0(i)−xr(i))2∑i=1n(x0(i)−x0¯)2⋅100%,where x0 stands for original signal and xrfor signal that was resampled to the original sampling rate by inverse DWT with lost bands replaced by zero vectors, both of length n. This value better represents the biological information that signals carry than measuring loss in the power spectrum as proposed in [20], because it takes into account both, nucleotide changes as well as large scale feature of a signal. Moreover, the overall spectral energy can be preserved using normalizing constant 2−m/2 for the output of mthfilter in DWT.
