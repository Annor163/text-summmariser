@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The compositional and content attributes of images carry information that enhances the performance of image retrieval. Standard images are constructed by following the rule of thirds that divides an image into nine equal parts by placing objects or regions of interest at the intersecting lines of the grid. An image represents regions and objects that are in a spatial semantic relationship with respect to each other. While the Bag of Features (BoF) representation is commonly used for image retrieval, it lacks spatial information. In this paper, we present two novel image representation methods based on the histograms of triangles, which add spatial information to the inverted index of BoF representation. Histograms of triangles are computed at two levels, by dividing an image into two and four triangles that are evaluated separately. Extensive experiments and comparisons conducted on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed image representations enhance the performance of image retrieval.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) provides a sustainable way to search for similar images in image archives by using the visual features of a query image [1,2]. Occlusion, overlapping objects, image resolution, variations in illumination, semantic gaps, spatial layout as well as exponential growth in multimedia archives all contribute to make CBIR a challenging problem [1,2]. In CBIR, feature vectors are used to represent images in the form of low-level visual features [1,2]. The feature vector of a query image is calculated and compared with the feature vectors of the images placed in an archive [3]. The closeness of the feature vector values determines the output [3]. The appearance of a similar view in two different images results in the closeness of feature vectors and it impairs the performance of image retrieval [3]. In an image, there is a spatial relationship between different regions of the image, yet due to the order-less representation of the image using BoF [4], this spatial information is lost. Approaches based on query expansion [5], soft quantization [6] and large vocabulary size [7] are used to enhance the performance of image retrieval. The main limitation of all these approaches is the lack of spatial information that provides discriminating details [7]. Two approaches are commonly used to add spatial information to the BoF representation [8]. The first approach uses geometric relationships [9] or the co-occurrence of visual words [10]. However, modeling these approaches in the case of large vocabulary size is computationally expensive [10]. The second approach [11] splits an image into sub-regions and constructs the histograms from each sub-region; it is considered robust for content-based image matching [11]. In view of the robust performance of the second approach, our proposed work involves extracting the histograms from triangular regions of the image.Images are constructed by following the rule of thirds, which divides an image into nine equal grids; objects or regions of interest are placed at intersecting lines of the grid (either on the left or on the right). The rule of thirds represents compositional and content attributes of the image, and incorporating these attributes into image retrieval enhances its performance [12]. Fig. 1(a)11www.tympanus.net/codrops/2012/05/23/understanding-the-rule-of-thirds-in-web-design/represents a standard image constructed by following the rule of thirds, while Fig. 1(b) represents a possible spatial semantic solution for efficient image retrieval. In a standard image, the sky, the sun or clouds are located at the top, objects of interest are at the right or left, and the ground, grass or water are found at the bottom of the image. This sequence represents a triangular relationship between objects and regions of interest in a scene. Fig. 2represents this content-based triangular relationship between different images of the Corel dataset. Discriminating objects (such as horses or elephants) and regions of interest (such as the sky, the ground or grass) are usually located in different sub-regions of the image. The construction of histograms from triangular regions of the image adds discriminating information to image retrieval in the form of objects and regions of interest that are located at the top, left, right and bottom of the image.Inspired by this, we propose two novel methods of image representation in the form of histograms computed from the triangular regions of an image. Dense features are extracted from an image; then, the feature space is quantized and visual vocabulary is constructed in order to achieve a compact representation. An image is divided into two and four triangular regions, while histograms are computed from the triangular regions. This information is added to the inverted index of the BoF representation. Images are divided into two and four triangular regions, which are referred to as Level 1 and Level 2, respectively. The main contributions of this paper are(1)The addition of spatial information to the inverted index of the BoF representation.Image representation in the form of triangular histograms.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 provides an overview of the BoF representation and presents our proposed methodology. While Section 4 presents evaluation measures and results obtained from two challenging image datasets, Section 5 concludes our work and points towards future directions in research.
