@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A more scientific decision making process for radio frequency identification (RFID) technology selection is important to increase success rate of RFID technology application. RFID technology selection can be formulated as a kind of group decision making (GDM) problem with intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs). This paper develops a novel method for solving such problems. First, A technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) based method is presented to rank intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs). To achieve higher group consensus as well as possible, we construct an intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model to derive experts’ weights. Depending on the construction of membership and non-membership functions, the constructed intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model is solved by three kinds of approaches: optimistic approach, pessimistic approach and mixed approach. Then to derive the ranking order of alternatives from the collective IFPR, we extend quantifier guided non-dominance degree (QGNDD) and quantifier guided dominance degree (QGDD) to intuitionistic fuzzy environment. A new two-phase ranking approach is designed to generate the ordering of alternatives based on QGNDD and QGDD. Thereby, the corresponding method is proposed for the GDM problems with IFPRs. Some generalizations on the constructed intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model are further discussed. At length, the validity of the proposed method is illustrated with a real-world RFID technology selection example.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a generic term of technologies that use radio frequency to communicate data, identify and track objects automatically [1]. Compared with bar codes, RFID technology has several advantages, for example, multiple tags read capability, no line of sight requirement for the communication, large operating and communication range, and read and write capability of transponder memory. With quick development of RFID, many researchers paid emerging attention to RFID technology. Most of them purely considered the technology of RFID, such as functionality, adoption challenges and management issues in RFID applications [2]. Meanwhile, some scholars studied decision making problems for selecting one proper RFID technology and gained quite a few achievements. These achievements can be roughly divided into three classes.The first class is qualitative analysis [3–5]. Early works on RFID technology decisions are most commonly evaluated by qualitative analysis [2]. By a qualitative content analysis, Huber and Michael [3] found that RFID can be used to minimize losses in the supply chain. Ngai et al. [4] studied eight critical success factors for the successful implementation of RFID systems to help firms deal with the difficulties before embarking on the journey of RFID implementation. Tzeng et al. [5] proposed a framework for evaluating the business value of RFID technology.The second class is quantitative analysis employing crisp numbers [6–12]. Lee and Lee [6] constructed a supply chain RFID investment evaluation model to maximize the value of RFID technology. Using fuzzy cognitive maps and genetic algorithms, Trappey et al. [7] developed a hybrid qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluating the performance of RFID-enabled reverse logistic operations. Ustundag et al. [8] proposed a method to analyze RFID investment, where the expected net present value of RFID investment was determined by Monte-Carlo simulation method. Sari [9] presented a comprehensive simulation model to determine the appropriate operational and environmental conditions under which the investment on RFID technology is more beneficial. Bunduchi et al. [10] studied the changes in the magnitude of costs and benefits associated with RFID adoption as the innovation diffuses across different industries. Qu et al. [11] built a Markov chain model to quantify the benefits of RFID from some aspects, such as reducing equipment shrinkage and staff time of searching for equipment in hospitals. Ustundag and Tanyas [12] used a simulation model to calculate the expected benefits of an integrated RFID system on a three-echelon supply chain.The third class is quantitative analysis by fuzzy numbers [13–16]. Some researchers have considered fuzziness and inaccuracy for the RFID technology selection. Lin [13] adopted fuzzy Delphi and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to analyze RFID system where the assessments of the performance take form of triangular fuzzy numbers. When the present values of expected cash flows and expected costs are estimated by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, Lee and Lee [14] employed an option analysis to evaluate RFID adoption in the supply chain. By integrating Monte Carlo simulation, fuzzy AHP and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods, Sari [15] developed a new hybrid fuzzy multi-alternative decision making method to select the best RFID solution provider. Chuu [16] introduced a fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making (GDM) algorithm using fusion principles of fuzzy information, 2-tuple linguistic representation model and maximum entropy ordered weighted averaging operator.The aforementioned methods have their respective superiorities and seem to be effective for selecting the best RFID technology. However, they cannot solve all types of problems and have some shortcomings as follows:(1)The qualitative analysis for RFID only studied some basic conceptual problems, which lacks of quantitative models and is not suitable for complex actual problems [3–5]. At the same time, qualitative researches have more subjectivity which strongly depends on researcher and research object. It is difficult to apply these methods to make reasonable and comprehensive decision for the RFID technology selection. In contrast, the quantitative researches can provide more accurate judgments for the complicated decision problems and are more convincing in practical applications.The second class methods evaluated the performance ratings for criteria by crisp numerical values [6–11]. However, due to the complexity of the implement of RFID and the influence of expert's subjective factors, an expert sometimes evaluates the complex criteria of alternatives depending on intuition and experience in real-life decision problems. It is impractical to express the evaluation information by accurate measurement and crisp numerical values. Since intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) [17] considers the membership and non-membership degrees simultaneously, it is flexible and practical in dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty [18–31].In the multi-criteria decision making methods [6–15], only single expert was considered during the process of selecting RFID technology. These methods cannot be used to solve GDM problems. With the increasing complexity of real-world decision making problems, it is not easy for single expert to fully evaluate the whole problems. Ideally, a group of experts with greater collective knowledge should be able to achieve better decisions than individual expert. Therefore, it may be more suitable to ascribe RFID technology selection as a type of GDM problems.Owing to diversity and incommensurability of criteria for evaluating RFID technology, revealing evaluations of alternatives on each criterion is quite a difficult job as there is a very limited research in this area [15]. However, it is easier and more convenient for experts to provide preference information in pairwise comparison of alternatives. Consequently, the RFID technology selection is formulated as a kind of GDM problems based on intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) in this paper.During the last decades, the concept of IFPRs has received much attention and some studies have been done on this subject. Xu [28] firstly proposed some concepts, such as IFPR, consistent IFPR, incomplete IFPR and acceptable IFPR. Then, he developed an approach to GDM based on IFPRs and an approach to GDM based on incomplete IFPRs, respectively. Subsequently, consensus analyses of IFPRs have been investigated [31–33]. For further applications of IFPRs to decision making, many useful and valuable decision making methods have been proposed by estimating priority weight [33–38]. Xu and Liao [33] applied IFPR to the intuitionistic fuzzy AHP and also developed a novel normalizing rank summation method to derive a priority vector of an IFPR. Xu [34] proposed a method for estimating criteria weights from IFPRs. Zeng et al. [35] developed a method based on similarity measures for interactive GDM with IFPRs. Liao et al. [36] designed a framework of GDM with IFPRs. Xia et al. [37] further defined the intuitionistic multiplicative preference relations. Xu [38] derived priority weight intervals from intuitionistic multiplicative preference relations. It is well known that experts’ weights play critical roles in GDM problems. However, none of the aforementioned works [30–35] discussed how to determine experts’ weights from IFPRs. In particular, existing methods [34,35] required that experts’ weights are completely given a priori or set to be equal. In general, expert who is more familiar with the domain of considered problems can make more accurate judgment and should possess higher importance.The concepts of quantifier guided non-dominance degree (QGNDD) and quantifier guided dominance degree (QGDD), proposed by Chiclana et al. [39], are used to select the best alternative(s) in classic decision making problems with crisp preference relations. Subsequently, the QGNDD and QGDD have been generalized to the cases of fuzzy set, interval-valued fuzzy set, and 2 tuple linguistic, respectively [39–42]. Chiclana et al. [40] and Wu and Chiclana [41] applied QGNDD and QGDD to fuzzy preference relations and interval-valued fuzzy reciprocal preference relations, respectively. Li and Fan [42] extended QGNDD to 2-tuple environment. Although Wu and Chiclana [32] studied QGNDD under intuitionistic fuzzy environment, they calculate QGNDD by score function of IFS and then only use the QGNDD to select the best alternative(s). It should be pointed out that the methods [32,42] ignored QGDD and ranked the alternatives merely according to QGNDD. As a result, it could happen that there exist two or more alternatives with the same QGNDD, i.e., a total ordering of alternatives is not guaranteed. In addition, there is no investigation to simultaneously extend the QGNDD and QGDD to accommodate intuitionistic fuzzy context directly.To overcome the aforesaid limitations, we firstly construct an intuitionistic fuzzy linear program to derive experts’ weights from IFPRs in this paper. Through extending QGNDD and QGDD to the scenario of IFPRs, a new two-phase ranking approach is designed to generate the ordering of alternatives. Then, a novel method for GDM with IFPRs is proposed and applied to RFID technology selection. The major contributions of this paper are highlighted in three aspects.(1)Motivated by TOPSIS, a new method for ranking IFVs is presented by using the closeness degrees, which is very simple and effective.An intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model is established to derive experts’ weights objectively. With different construction of non-membership functions, three kinds of approaches, including optimistic approach, pessimistic approach and mixed approach, are proposed to solve this model.We firstly extend QGNDD and QGDD to GDM with IFPRs. Thereby, a new two-phase ranking approach is designed to generate the ordering of alternatives based on QGNDD and QGDD.The remainder of this paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some preliminaries about the classic approach based on QGNDD and QGDD, definitions of IFS and IFPR and proposes a new TOPSIS-based ranking method of IFVs. In Section 3, the group consensus for GDM with IFPRs is analyzed. In Section 4, experts’ weights are derived by constructing intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model. The ordering of alternatives is generated by a new two-phase ranking approach based on QGNDD and QGDD. Thereby, a new method for GDM with IFPRs is proposed. For the sake of illustration of the proposed method, a real-world example of RFID technology selection is analyzed in Section 5. In Section 6, we further discuss the membership function about the constructed intuitionistic fuzzy linear program. Section 7 ends the paper with some conclusions.In this section, some preliminaries are reviewed including the classic approach based on QGNDD and QGDD, definitions of IFS and IFPR. Then, a new TOPSIS-based method is developed to rank IFVs.The concepts of QGNDD and QGDD are proposed to select the proper one from all alternatives with crisp preference relations and reviewed briefly below.For a set of alternatives X={x1, x2, …, xn}, the preference of the alternative xiover alternative xjis given as pij∈[0,1] (i, j=1, 2, …, n). QGDD is used to quantify the dominance that one alternative has over all the others in a fuzzy majority sense. It acts on the set X as(1)DDi=ϕQ(pij|j=1,2,…,n,j≠i),where ϕQis an ordered weighted averaging operator [43–45] guided by the linguistic quantifier represented by the basic unit-interval monotonic function Q.It can be found that QGDD DDiis the measure of the dominated degree of alternative xiover the other alternatives.The elements of the set(2)XDD={xi|DDi=maxj{DDj},xi∈X}are called maximum dominance elements of the fuzzy majority of X quantified by Q.QGNDD denotes the degree to which each alternative is not dominated by a fuzzy majority of remaining alternatives. It is defined as(3)NDi=ϕQ(1−pjis)(j=1,2,…,n,j≠i),wherepjis=max{pji−pij,0}represents the degree up to which xiis strictly dominated by xj.It can be seen that if NDi=α then the alternative xiis dominated by a fuzzy majority of elements to a degree not higher than α. When the fuzzy quantifier represents the statement “all”, the algebraic aggregation ϕQcorresponds to the conjunction operator Min [39].The elements of the set(4)XND={xi|NDi=maxj{NDj},xi∈X}are called maximal non-dominated elements by the fuzzy majority of X quantified by Q.Therefore, in a complete selection process, the dominance degree and the non-dominance degree can be applied in four steps:Step 1:Calculate QGNDD NDiof each alternative xiby Eq. (3).Determine the set XND of alternatives. If #(XND)=1 (where #(XND) means the number of elements in the set XND), then end and the alternative in the set XND is the sole best alternative. Otherwise, continue.Calculate QGDD DDiof alternative xiin the set XND by Eq. (1).Determine the set XDD of alternatives, which also is an optimal solution set. The best alternative is in the set XDD.The above classic approach is used to select the best alternative by QGNDD and QGDD. However, it cannot acquire the ordering of all alternatives since it ignores the preference of other alternatives.Definition 1[17,27]Let Z={z1, z2, …, zn} be a non-empty set of universe. An IFS A in Z is defined as A={<z, μA(z), νA(z)>|z∈Z}, which is characterized by a membership function μA:Z→[0, 1] and a non-membership function νA:Z→[0, 1] with the condition 0≤μA(z)+νA(z)≤1 for all z∈Z, where μA(z) and νA(z) represent, respectively, the degrees of membership and non-membership of the element z to the set A. For each IFS A in Z, πA(z)=1−μA(z)−νA(z) is called the degree of hesitation of the element z to the set A. Especially, if πA(z)=0, then the IFS A is degraded to a fuzzy set.For an IFS A, the pair (μA(z), νA(z)) is called an IFV. Denote the set of all IFVs by Ω. For two IFVsa˜i=(μi,νi)(i=1,2), the partial ordera˜1≤pa˜2of IFVs is defined as follows [19]:(5)a˜1≤pa˜2ifμ1≤μ2andν1≥ν2.In addition, the complement set ofa˜=(μ,ν)is(6)a˜c=(ν,μ).An IFPR R on the set X is denoted by an intuitionistic fuzzy judgment matrixR=(r˜ij)n×n⊂X×X, wherer˜ij=(μij,νij)is an IFV, μijis the degree to which xiis preferred to xj, νijis the degree to which xiis non-preferred to xj, and πij=1−μij−νijrepresents the hesitation degree to which xiis preferred to xj. Furthermore, μijand νijfulfill the conditions:0≤μij+νij≤1,μij=νji,μii=νii=0.5for alli,j=1,2,…,n.Motivated by TOPSIS, the closeness degree is introduced to rank the IFVs.Definition 3[46]Let A={<z, μA(z), νA(z)>|z∈Z} and B={<z, μB(z), νB(z)>|z∈Z} be two IFSs. The Hamming distance between A and B in Z={z1, z2, …, zn} is defined as follows:(7)d(A,B)=12n∑i=1n(|μA(zi)−μB(zi)|+|νA(zi)−νB(zi)|+|πA(zi)−πB(zi)|),where πA(zi)=1−μA(zi)−νA(zi) and πB(zi)=1−μB(zi)−νB(zi).Let1˜=(1,0)be a positive ideal IFV and0˜=(0,1)be a negative ideal IFV. For IFVsa˜=(μ,ν),1˜=(1,0)and0˜=(0,1),we have(8)d(a˜,1˜)=12(|μ−1|+|ν−0|+|π−0|)and(9)d(a˜,0˜)=12(|μ−0|+|ν−1|+|π−0|)where π=1−μ−ν.By TOPSIS, the closera˜=(μ,ν)to1˜=(1,0)and at the same time the farthera˜to0˜=(0,1), the better IFVa˜. Thus, the definition of closeness degree of IFVa˜=(μ,ν)is given as follows:Leta˜=(μ,ν)be an IFV. The closeness degree of IFVa˜is defined as(10)T(a˜)=d(a˜,0˜)d(a˜,1˜)+d(a˜,0˜),whered(a˜,1˜)is the hamming distance betweena˜and1˜=(1,0)as Eq. (8) andd(a˜,0˜)is the hamming distance betweena˜and0˜=(0,1)as Eq. (9).By Eqs. (8) and (9), the closeness degree of IFVa˜=(μ,ν)is calculated as follows:(11)T(a˜)=1−ν1+π.Leta˜i=(μi,νi)(i=1,2)be two IFVs. Then the ranking of IFVs can be defined as:IfT(a˜1)>T(a˜2), thena˜1is bigger thana˜2, denoted bya˜1≻a˜2;IfT(a˜1)=T(a˜2), thena˜1is indifferent toa˜2, denoted bya˜1≈a˜2;IfT(a˜1)<T(a˜2), thena˜1is smaller thana˜2, denoted bya˜1≺a˜2.The ranking of IFVs based the closeness degree has some desirable properties which are listed in the following propositions.For two IFVsa˜i=(μi,νi)(i=1,2), Ifμ1≤μ2andv1≥v2,thena˜1≺_a˜2. Namely, ifa˜1≤pa˜2,thena˜1≺_a˜2. Here, the symbola˜1≺_a˜2meansa˜1is smaller than or indifferent toa˜2.By Eq. (11), we haveT(a˜i)=(1−νi)/(1+πi)=1/(1+(1−μi)/(1−vi))(i=1,2). Ifμ1≤μ2andv1≥v2, thenT(a˜1)≤T(a˜2). Thus,a˜1≺_a˜2, which completes the proof of Proposition 1.Proposition 1 shows that the new ranking method accords with the partial order of IFVs.Proposition 2For an IFVa˜=(μ,ν),thenT(a˜)+T(a˜c)=1. In addition, ifμ≥ν,thena˜c≺_a˜.By Eq. (6), we havea˜c=(ν,μ). It directly follows from Eq. (11) thatT(a˜)+T(a˜c)=((1−ν)/(1+π))+((1−μ)/(1+π))=1.Furthermore, ifμ≥ν,then(1−μ)/(1−v)≤1. Thus,T(a˜)=1/(1+(1−μ)/(1−v))≥1/2andT(a˜c)≤1/2. Therefore,T(a˜c)≤T(a˜), which yields thata˜c≺_a˜. The proof of Proposition 2 is completed.In this section, GDM problems with IFPRs are described. Then the group consensus is analyzed for GDM problems with IFPRs.For a GDM problem, let E={e1, e2, …, eq} be a set of experts, X={x1, x2, …, xn} be a set of alternatives. Expert ek(k=1, 2, …, q) is able to provide his/her preference information for each pair of alternatives and forms the individual IFPRRk=r˜ijkn×n,wherer˜ijk=(μijk,νijk)is an IFV,μijkis the degree to which xiis preferred to xjgiven by expert ek,νijkis the degree to which xiis non-preferred to xjgiven by expert ek.Owing to the definition of IFPR,r˜ijk(k=1,2,…,q)in individual IFPRRk=r˜ijkn×nhave the following characteristics:(12)0≤μijk+νijk≤1,μijk=νjik,νijk=μjik,μiik=νiik=0.5for alli,j=1,2,…,n.Theorem 1[31]LetRk=r˜ijkn×n(k=1,2,…,q)be q IFPRs given by expert ekrespectively, wherer˜ijk=(μijk,νijk). Suppose w=(w1, w2, …, wq)Tbe experts’ weight vector, where wkreflects the importance degree of expert ek, satisfying that∑k=1qwk=1andwk≥0(k=1,2,…,q). Then the aggregation matrixR=(r˜ij)n×nis a collective IFRP ofRk=r˜ijkn×n(k=1,2,…,q), where(13)r˜ij=(μij,νij),μij=∑k=1qwkμijk,νij=∑k=1qwkνijk,for alli,j=1,2,…,n.According to Theorem 1, the collective IFRPR=(r˜ij)n×nwithr˜ij=(μij,νij)can be aggregated by q individual IFPRsRk=r˜ijkn×nk=1,2,…,q.Motivated by the idea of Xu and Cai [47], we analyze the group consensus for GDM with IFPRs.If the individual IFPRRlis completely consistent with the collective IFRPR, namely, the individual opinion of expert elabout the preference information of pairwise alternatives is the same as the group’ opinion, thenRl=R. Thus, each individual preference elementr˜ijlinRlshould be equal to the corresponding collective preference elementr˜ijinR, i.e.,r˜ijl=r˜ijfor alli,j=1,2,…,n. Using Eq. (13), we get(14)μijl=∑k=1qwkμijk,νijl=∑k=1qwkνijk,for alli,j=1,2,…,n.If all the individual IFPRsRl(l=1, 2, …, q) are consistent with the collective IFRPR, then Eq. (14) holds for all l=1, 2, …, q, i.e.,(15)μijl=∑k=1qwkμijk,νijl=∑k=1qwkνijkfor alli,j=1,2,…,n;l=1,2,…,qBy Definition 2, Eq. (15) is simplified as:(16)μijl=∑k=1qwkμijk,νijl=∑k=1qwkνijk,for alli,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q.In this case, the group reaches complete consensus. Experts’ weight vectorw=(w1, w2, …, wq)T can be directly derived by Eq. (16).However, in many actual situations, the individual IFPRsRl(l=1, 2, …, q) are not always consistent with the collective IFRPR. If the group does not reach complete consensus, there does not exist a vectorwthat satisfies Eq. (16) simultaneously. Therefore, a good enough solution is to find an experts’ weight vectorwthat satisfies Eq. (16) as well as possible, such that the value of∑k=1qwkμijkshould be betweenμijl−θμijl−andμijl+θμijl+and the value of∑k=1qwkνijkshould be betweenνijl−θνijl−andνijl+θνijl+whereθμijl+,θμijl−,θνijl+,θνijl−≥0. It means that a good enough solution has to satisfy all judgments approximately, keepingμijl−∑k=1qwkμijkandνijl−∑k=1qwkνijkclose to zero, or(17)μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk=˜0,νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk=˜0for alli,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q,where the symbol=˜denotes the statement “fuzzy equal to”.Denote the deviations of the membership and non-membership degrees byHμijl(w)=μijl−∑k=1qwkμijkandHνijl(w)=νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk(l=1,2,…,q), respectively. For simplicity of notations, we unify the symbolsHμijl(w)andHνijl(w)intoHijl(w)in what follows.IfHijl(w)=˜0, expert's satisfaction degree is equal to one and the dissatisfaction degree is equal to zero. Otherwise, the satisfaction degree should decrease down to some tolerance limitsθμijl+andθμijl−or the dissatisfaction degree should increase up to some tolerance limitsθνijl+andθνijl−. Thus, we can use IFS to characterize fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜0and transform Eq. (17) into intuitionistic fuzzy constraints. The reasons for this transformation originate from two facts:(i)Any fuzzy equality relation may contain inherent uncertainty, especially hesitation. Expert may accept this equality relation with some satisfaction degree (acceptance or membership degree) and meanwhile reject it with some dissatisfaction degree (rejection or non-membership degree). Since IFS considers not only membership degree to a given set, but also non-membership degree, it is suitable to introduce IFS to express the fuzzy equality relation by using rejection degree of equality relation together with its acceptance degree.Because each expert gives pair-wise comparison between alternatives with IFPRRk=r˜ijkn×n, it is more reasonable and natural to regard the fuzzy equalities of Eq. (17) as intuitionistic fuzzy constraints.Next, we give the definition of an intuitionistic fuzzy inequality and use IFS to express Eq. (17) for the first time.Definition 5Denote the (q−1)-dimensional simplexW=(w1,w2,…,wq)T|∑k=1qwk=1;wk≥0,k=1,2,…,q. CallHijl(w)=˜IF0an intuitionistic fuzzy inequality, which can be represented by an IFS on the universe W as follows:Cijl={〈w,μijl(w),vijl(w)〉|w∈W},where the membership functionμijl(w)∈[0,1]and the non-membership functionνijl(w)∈[0,1]satisfy thatμijl(w)+νijl(w)≤1and can be appropriately constructed (see the subsequent context).In particularly, ifνijl(w)=0, then the intuitionistic fuzzy inequalityHijl(w)=˜IF0reduces to a fuzzy inequality; ifμijl(w)=1andνijl(w)=0, then the intuitionistic fuzzy inequalityHijl(w)=˜IF0reduces to traditional crisp equality.Consequently, the fuzzy constraints of Eq. (17) can be transformed into a set of intuitionistic fuzzy constraints:(18)Hijl(w)=˜IF0,for alli,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q,where the symbol=˜IFis an intuitionistic fuzzy version of the order relation “=” in the real number set and has the linguistic interpretation “essentially equal to”.In this section, we determine experts’ weights by constructing an intuitionistic fuzzy linear program. Based on QGNDD and QGDD, the ordering of alternatives can be obtained by a designed two-phase ranking approach. Then a novel method is proposed to solve GDM with IFPRs.In the following, we will formulate an intuitionistic fuzzy optimization problem to derive the optimal vectorw* of expert's weights from Eq. (18). Inspired by Dubey et al. [48], three approaches are proposed to solve the intuitionistic fuzzy optimization model depending on the construction of non-membership functions.The linear membership function and non-membership function for intuitionistic fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜IF0are constructed as(19)μijl(w)=1,ifHijl(w)=01−Hijl(w)θijl,if0<Hijl(w)≤θijl1+Hijl(w)θijl,if−θijl≤Hijl(w)<00,elseand(20)νijl(w)=0,ifHijl(w)=0Hijl(w)θijl+δijl,if0<Hijl(w)≤θijl+δijl−Hijl(w)θijl+δijl,if−(θijl+δijl)≤Hijl(w)<01,elserespectively, whereθijl,δijl>0andμijl(w)+νijl(w)≤1(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q).The membership functionμijl(w)represents acceptance degree of intuitionistic fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜IF0, while the non-membership functionνijl(w)represents rejection degree of intuitionistic fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜IF0. The membership and non-membership functions of intuitionistic fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜IF0are depicted in Fig. 1.As shown in Fig. 1, it can be observed that in the intervalsθijl,θijl+δijland−(θijl+δijl),−θijl, the value ofμijl(w)is zero while the value ofνijl(w)is not one. In the intervalθijl,θijl+δijl, it represents that experts are not concerned to accept the situation of large thanθijl, but they do not completely reject the values betweenθijlandθijl+δijlsimultaneously. In the interval[−(θijl+δijl),−θijl], it represents that experts are not concerned to accept the situation of less than−θijl, but they do not completely reject the values between−(θijl+δijl)and−θijlsimultaneously. As such, this approach is optimistic.Obviously,μijl(w),νijl(w)∈[0,1]andμijl(w)+νijl(w)≤1. For the membership function, ifHijl(w)=0,μijl(w)=1which means “complete satisfaction”; ifHijl(w)>θijlorHijl(w)<−θijl,μijl(w)=0which means “complete dissatisfaction”; if−θijl<Hijl(w)<θijl,μijl(w)∈(0,1)which means “approximate satisfaction”. For the non-membership function, ifHijl(w)=0,vijl(w)=0which means “not rejection”; ifHijl(w)>θijl+δijlorHijl(w)<−(θijl+δijl),vijl(w)=1which means “complete rejection”; if−(θijl+δijl)<Hijl(w)<θijl+δijl,νijl(w)∈(0,1)which means “approximate rejection”.According to Definition 5, intuitionistic fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜IF0can be represented as an IFSCijl=w,μijl(w),vijl(w)|w∈W. Therefore, by the Bellman and Zadeh's extension principle [49], an intuitionistic fuzzy decision S can be viewed as an IFS given byS={〈w,μS(w),vS(w)〉|w∈W}, whereμS(w)=minμijl(w)|i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,qandvS(w)=maxvijl(w)|i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q.Thus, Eq. (18) can be transformed to the following system of crisp inequalities:μijl(w)≥η(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)vijl(w)≤ϑ(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)η≥ϑ,ϑ≥0,η+ϑ≤1where η denotes the minimal acceptable degree of intuitionistic fuzzy constraints and ϑ denotes the maximal degree of rejection of intuitionistic fuzzy constraints.The optimal vectorw* of expert's weights can be obtained by constructing a bi-objective program of maximizing the minimal acceptable degree η and minimizing the maximal degree of rejection ϑ as follows:(21)maxηminϑs.t.μijl(w)≥η(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)vijl(w)≤ϑ(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)η≥ϑ,ϑ≥0,η+ϑ≤1,w∈WThe above bi-objective program can be converted into a single objective program:(22)max{η−ϑ}s.t.μijl(w)≥η(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)vijl(w)≤ϑ(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)η≥ϑ,ϑ≥0,η+ϑ≤1,w∈WPlugging Eqs. (19) and (20) into Eq. (22), we can derive the following linear program:(23)max{η−ϑ}s.t.θμijl(η−1)≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl(1−η)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−θμijl+δμijlϑ≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl+δμijlϑ(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)θνijl(η−1)≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl(1−η)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−θνijl+δνijlϑ≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl+δνijlϑ(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)η≥ϑ,ϑ≥0,η+ϑ≤1,∑k=1qwk=1,wk≥0(k=1,2,…,q)By solving the above linear program, the optimal solution (w*, η*, ϑ*) can be obtained in optimistic approach, wherew* is the experts’ weight vector, η* and ϑ* are the maximum acceptance degree and the minimum rejection degree of constraints, respectively. If η*=1 and ϑ*=1, then IFPRsRl=r˜ijln×n(l=1,2,…,q)are consistent with the collective IFPR. The group reaches complete consensus. Otherwise, IFPRsRl=r˜ijln×n(l=1,2,…,q)are inconsistent. The group does not reach complete consensus. In general, the tolerance parametersθijlandδijlshould be chosen enough large that makes the optimal solution non-empty.In this approach, the linear membership function for intuitionistic fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜IF0is also Eq. (19) while the non-membership function is constructed as(24)νijl(w)=0,if−(θijl−λijl)≤Hijl(w)≤θijl−λijlHijl(w)−(θijl−λijl)λijl,ifθijl−λijl<Hijl(w)≤θijl−Hijl(w)+(θijl−λijl)λijl,if−θijl≤Hijl(w)<−(θijl−λijl)1,elsewhereθijl>λijl>0andμijl(w)+νijl(w)≤1(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q).The membership and non-membership functions ofHijl(w)=˜IF0are depicted in Fig. 2.It can be seen from Fig. 2 that in the interval−θijl−λijl,θijl−λijl, the value ofνijl(w)is zero while the value ofμijl(w)is not always equal to one. In the interval−(θijl−λijl),θijl−λijl, it represents that experts are not concerned to reject the situation between−θijl−λijlandθijl−λijl, but they do not always completely accept the values between−(θijl−λijl)andθijl−λijlsimultaneously. As such, this approach is pessimistic.Similar to the optimism approach, we can derive the following linear program:(25)max{η−ϑ}s.t.θμijl(η−1)≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl(1−η)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−λμijl(ϑ−1)−θμijl≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl+λμijl(ϑ−1)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>il=1,2,…,q);θνijl(η−1)≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl(1−η)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−λνijl(ϑ−1)−θνijl≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl+λνijl(ϑ−1)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)η≥ϑ,ϑ≥0,η+ϑ≤1,∑k=1qwk=1,wk≥0(k=1,2,…,q)By solving the above linear program, we can get the optimal solution (w*, η*, ϑ*) in pessimistic approach.In this approach, the linear membership function for intuitionistic fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜IF0is also Eq. (19) while the non-membership function is constructed as(26)νijl(w)=0,if−θijl+αijl−βijl≤Hijl(w)≤θijl+αijl−βijlHijl(w)−θijl+αijl−βijlβijl,ifθijl+αijl−βijl<Hijl(w)≤θijl+αijl−Hijl(w)+θijl+αijl−βijlβijl,if−θijl+αijl≤Hijl(w)<−θijl+αijl−βijl1,elsewhereθijl+αijl>βijl>αijl>0andμijl(w)+νijl(w)≤1(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q).The membership and non-membership functions ofHijl(w)=˜IF0are depicted in Fig. 3.Fig. 3 shows that in the interval−(θijl+αijl−βijl),θijl+αijl−βijl, the value ofνijl(w)is zero while the value ofμijl(w)is not always one. At the same time, in the intervalsθijl,θijl+αijland−(θijl+αijl),θijl, the value ofμijl(w)is zero while the value ofνijl(w)is not one. Therefore, it is a mixed approach.Analogously, we can derive the following linear program:(27)max{η−ϑ}s.t.θμijl(η−1)≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl(1−η)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−θμijl+αμijl+βμijl(ϑ−1)≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl+αμijl+βμijl(ϑ−1)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)θνijl(η−1)≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl(1−η)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−θνijl+ανijl+βνijl(ϑ−1)≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl+ανijl+βνijl(ϑ−1)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)η≥ϑ,ϑ≥0,η+ϑ≤1,∑k=1qwk=1,wk≥0(k=1,2,…,q)By solving the above linear program, we can get the optimal solution (w*, η*, ϑ*) in mixed approach.Overall, experts can select different approaches to deriving the optimal experts’ weight vectorw* according to their preferences and characteristics of actual decision problems.As mentioned in Section 2.1, the classic approach based on QGNDD and QGDD cannot acquire the ordering of all alternatives. The existing research failed to simultaneously extend the QGNDD and QGDD to accommodate intuitionistic fuzzy context. Therefore, to derive the ordering of alternatives from collective IFPR, we design a new two-phase ranking approach based on QGNDD and QGDD in the sequel.Phase 1: In the collective IFPRR=(r˜ij)n×n, the higher the preference valuer˜ij, the stronger the preference for xiover xj. For alternative xi, its QGNDD can be calculated as:(28)NDi=min{1−rjis|j=1,2,…,n,j≠i},whererjis=max{(T(r˜ji)−T(r˜ij)),0}represents the degree to which alternative xiis dominated by xj,T(r˜ji)andT(r˜ij)are respectively the closeness degrees of IFVr˜jiandr˜ijdefined in Eq. (11).To get ordering of alternatives, suppose alternative xihas an initial ranking value χi=1 (i=1, 2, …, n). The smaller the ranking value χi, the better alternative xi. Then in phase 1, we generate updated ranking value χiby the devised Algorithm 1. Then, the ranking order of alternatives can be obtained according to ascending ordering of χi(i=1, 2, …, n).Algorithm 1An iteration algorithm to rank alternatives in phase 1Step 1 Calculate QGNDD NDifor alternative xi(i=1, 2, …, n) by Eq. (28)Step 2 Let m=1 and X(1)=XStep 3 Select the set of non-dominated alternativesXND(m)=xi|NDi=max{NDj|j=1,2,…,n},xi∈X(m)from X(m) and revise the ranking value χi=m for allxi∈XND(m). Meanwhile, the remained alternatives set is denoted by X(m+1), i.e.X(m+1)=X(m)/XND(m)Step 4 If X(m+1)≠ϕ, then m=m+1 and go to Step 3; otherwise, go to Step 5Step 5 Rank alternatives according to the ascending ordering of χi(i=1, 2, …, n)If all#XND(σ)=1(σ=1,2,…,m), then all alternatives can be ranked in different positions and the alternative inXND(1)is the optimal one. Otherwise, more than one alternative have the same ranking value, i.e., the order of such alternatives cannot be distinguished, so the ordering is partial.The motivation for the following phase is that for alternatives with the same ranking value, it is not sufficient to obtain further ordering only using information on QGNDD. To obtain further ordering, more information about QGDD needs to be considered. In phase 2, we use QGDD for further analyzing such the alternatives with the same ranking value derived from phase 1.Phase 2: QGDD for the alternativexi∈XND(σ)satisfying#XND(σ)≠1is defined as(29)DDi=1n−1∑j=1,j≠inr˜ij.Eq. (29) can be calculated by Eq. (13) as follows:(30)DDi=1n−1∑j=1,j≠inμij,1n−1∑j=1,j≠inνij.Note that QGDD DDiis an IFV. According to Eq. (11), the closeness degree T(DDi) of DDiis computed for alternativexi∈XND(σ). If T(DDi)>T(DDj), thenDDi≻DDj(xi,xj∈XND(σ),j≠i), alternative xiis more preferable than xj. This can generate the ordering of alternatives with the same ranking value in phase 2.According to the aforementioned analysis, Algorithm 2 can be summarized as follows:Algorithm 2An algorithm to rank the alternatives with the same ranking valueStep 1 Calculate QGDD DDifor alternativexi∈XND(σ)satisfying#XND(σ)≠1by Eq. (30)Step 2 Determine the closeness degree T(DDi) of QGDD DDiby Eq. (11)Step 3 Rank alternatives with the same ranking value according to the closeness degree T(DDi)Then, integrating the ranking information from phases 1 and 2, the ordering of alternatives can be obtained.The proposed method for GDM with IFPRs is outlined as follows:Step 1:Construct IFPRRk=r˜ijkn×nby expert ek.Determine experts’ weights by solving Eq. (23) or (25) or (27) according to experts’ risk preference.Calculate the collective IFPRR=(r˜ij)n×nby Eq. (13).Get the order of alternatives using the two-phase ranking approach based on the QGNDD and QGDD.The above process for GDM with IFPRs is depicted in Fig. 4.To illustrate the method proposed in this paper, a real-world RFID technology selection example is given. Meanwhile, the comparison analyses of the obtained results are conducted in this section.China Resources Vanguard Co. Ltd. (CR Vanguard for short) is a Chinese retail corporation that operates chains of large discount department stores and warehouse stores. It has over 3835 stores in 288 cities. Recently, due to increasing flow rate of consumers and volume of sales, the inventory corresponding to the consumer demand for product markets has changed so rapidly that competitiveness of supply chain has become increasingly fierce. RFID is regarded as a promising technology for the optimization of supply chain process since it improves manufacturing and retail operations from forecasting demand to planning, managing inventory, and distribution [16]. The senior managers in CR Vanguard desire to apply the RFID technology in order to effectively manage inventory in its supply chain and enhance its competitiveness. For this purpose, CR Vanguard invites three experts e1, e2 and e3 to form one decision group. After a preliminary screening, five potential alternatives (i.e., RFID technology vendors) Ai(i=1, 2, …, 5) remain for further evaluation. The experts ek(k=1, 2, 3) are required to conduct pair-wise comparisons for the five alternatives, resulting in the following individual IFPRs:R1=(0.5000,0.5000)(0.6001,0.2999)(0.3000,0.6000)(0.6000,0.2000)(0.5000,0.4000)(0.2999,0.6001)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.4000,0.6000)(0.5000,0.3000)(0.6000,0.3000)(0.6000,0.3000)(0.6000,0.4000)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.4000,0.3000)(0.2000,0.5000)(0.2000,0.6000)(0.3000,0.5000)(0.3000,0.4000)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.3000,0.6000)(0.4000,0.5000)(0.3000,0.6000)(0.5000,0.2000)(0.6000,0.3000)(0.5000,0.5000)R2=(0.5000,0.5000)(0.4001,0.3999)(0.5000,0.2000)(0.4000,0.5000)(0.7000,0.3000)(0.3999,0.4001)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.3000,0.5000)(0.3000,0.5000)(0.4000,0.6000)(0.2000,0.5000)(0.5000,0.3000)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.6000,0.2000)(0.5000,0.4000)(0.5000,0.4000)(0.6000,0.3000)(0.2000,0.6000)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.6000,0.3000)(0.3000,0.7000)(0.6000,0.4000)(0.4000,0.5000)(0.3000,0.6000)(0.5000,0.5000)R3=(0.5000,0.5000)(0.2001,0.5999)(0.5000,0.3000)(0.3000,0.5000)(0.4000,0.5000)(0.5999,0.2001)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.7000,0.3000)(0.4000,0.4000)(0.7000,0.2000)(0.3000,0.5000)(0.3000,0.7000)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.2000,0.7000)(0.4000,0.3000)(0.5000,0.3000)(0.4000,0.4000)(0.7000,0.2000)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.5000,0.4000)(0.5000,0.4000)(0.2000,0.7000)(0.3000,0.4000)(0.4000,0.5000)(0.5000,0.5000)In what follows, we respectively employ three approaches to deriving experts’ weights and then solve this example.When experts select the mixed approach, the linear programming model can be constructed by Eq. (27). Set the tolerance parametersθμijl=θνijl=2,αμijl=ανijl=1,βμijl=βνijl=2i,j=1,2,…,5;j>i;l=1,2,3. Then solving this linear programming model by Lingo 11, experts’ weights can be obtained as follows: w1=0.2558, w2=0.3023, w3=0.4419.By Eq. (13), the collective IFPRR=(r˜ij)n×nare derived:R=(0.5000,0.5000)(0.3629,0.4627)(0.4488,0.3465)(0.4070,0.4233)(0.5163,0.4140)(0.4627,0.3629)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.5023,0.4372)(0.3953,0.4349)(0.5837,0.3465)(0.3465,0.4488)(0.4372,0.5023)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.3721,0.4465)(0.3791,0.3814)(0.4233,0.4070)(0.4349,0.3953)(0.4465,0.3721)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.4791,0.4209)(0.4140,0.5163)(0.3465,0.5837)(0.3814,0.3791)(0.4209,0.4791)(0.5000,0.5000)Then we rank all alternatives. In phase 1, QGNDDs NDiof alternatives xi(i=1, 2,…, 5) are computed by Eq. (28) as follows:ND1=0.9150,ND2=0.9662,ND3=0.9150,ND4=1.0000,ND5=0.7783.According to Algorithm 1, the corresponding set of non-dominated alternatives can be derived:XND(1)={x4},XND(2)={x2},XND(3)={x1,x3},XND(4)={x5}.Therefore, the ranking value for each alternative can be generated as:χ1=3,χ2=2,χ3=3,χ4=1,χ5=4.Since#XND(3)≠1, the order of alternatives inXND(3)(i.e. x1 and x3) cannot be distinguished. Then we further analyze alternatives x1 and x3 in phase 2.Utilizing Eq. (29), QGDDs of x1 and x3 are calculated:DD1=(0.4337, 0.4116),DD3=(0.3837, 0.4448).By Eq. (11), the closeness degrees T(DDi) (i=1, 3) can be obtained as T(DD1)=0.5096, T(DD3)=0.4739. We have T(DD1)>T(DD3), that is to say, x1≻x3.By integrating the ranking values and closeness degree, the ranking order of alternatives is x4≻x2≻x1≻x3≻x5 and the best is alternative x4.When experts select the optimistic approach, the linear programming model can be constructed by Eq. (23). Set the tolerance parametersθμij1=θνij1=θμij3=θνij3=10,δμij1=δνij1=δμij3=δνij3=θμij2=θνij2=5,δμij2=δνij2=10(i,j=1,2,…,5;j>i). Then solving this linear programming model by Lingo 11, experts’ weights can be obtained as w1=0.1186, w2=0.5424, w3=0.3390.By Eq. (13), the collective IFPRR=(r˜ij)n×nis derived asR=(0.5000,0.5000)(0.3560,0.4558)(0.4763,0.2813)(0.3898,0.4644)(0.5746,0.3797)(0.4558,0.3560)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.4475,0.4441)(0.3576,0.4966)(0.5254,0.4288)(0.2813,0.4763)(0.4441,0.4475)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.4407,0.3814)(0.4305,0.3780)(0.4644,0.3898)(0.4966,0.3576)(0.3814,0.4407)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.5305,0.3695)(0.3797,0.5746)(0.4288,0.5254)(0.3780,0.4305)(0.3695,0.5305)(0.5000,0.5000)QGNDDs of alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, 5) are computed by Eq. (28) as follows:ND1=0.9160,ND2=0.8787,ND3=0.8431,ND4=0.9496,ND5=0.8136.Then similar to the optimistic approach, the ranking value χifor alternative xi(i=1, 2,..., 5) can be generated as χ1=2, χ2=3, χ3=4, χ4=1, χ5=5. Thus, the ranking order for all the alternatives is x4≻x1≻x2≻x3≻x5 and the best is alternative x4.When experts select the pessimistic approach, the linear programming model can be constructed according to Eq. (25). Set the tolerance parametersθμijl=θνijl=2,λμijl=λνijl=1i,j=1,2,…,5;j>i;l=1,2,3. Then solving this linear programming model by Lingo 11, experts’ weights can be obtained as w1=0.7143, w2=0.0476, w3=0.2381.By Eq. (13), the collective IFPRR=(r˜ij)n×nis derived as:R=(0.5000,0.5000)(0.4953,0.3761)(0.3571,0.5095)(0.5190,0.2857)(0.4857,0.4190)(0.3761,0.4953)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.4667,0.5238)(0.4667,0.3381)(0.6143,0.2905)(0.5095,0.3571)(0.5238,0.4667)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.3619,0.3905)(0.2619,0.4476)(0.2857,0.5190)(0.3381,0.4667)(0.3905,0.3619)(0.5000,0.5000)(0.3619,0.5381)(0.4190,0.4857)(0.2905,0.6143)(0.4476,0.2619)(0.5381,0.3619)(0.5000,0.5000)QGNDDs of alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, 5) are computed by Eq. (28) as follows:ND1=0.8655,ND2=0.8943,ND3=0.8561,ND4=0.8048,ND5=0.7043.Then similar to the optimistic approach, the ranking value χifor alternative xi(i=1, 2, …, 5) can be generated as χ1=2, χ2=1, χ3=3, χ4=4, χ5=5. Since#XND(σ)=1(σ=1,2,⋯,m), the ranking order is x2≻x1≻x3≻x4≻x5 and the best is alternative x2.It can be seen from Table 1that the best alternative may be changed with different approaches. In sum, experts can select different linear programming models to derive experts’ weight vector according to their risk preference, which embodies the flexibility of the proposed method in this paper.In the above example, the computation results are obtained by given tolerance parameters a priori. However, the ranking order of alternatives may vary with the values of tolerance parameters. To set appropriate tolerance parameters, it is necessary to do sensitivity analyses of the tolerance parameters.Since Eqs. (23), (25) and (27) are linear programming models, the sensitivity analyses are the straightforward tasks. While other parameters are not changed, we change the value ofθν242in mixed approach, the value ofλμ121in optimistic approach and the value ofdμ342in pessimistic approach. To reflect alternatives’ order intuitively, QGNDDs of alternatives about different values ofθν242,λμ121anddμ342in different approaches are depicted in Figs. 5–7, respectively.As shown in Fig. 5, we find that the ranking orders of alternatives may be not the same when the parameter values ofθν242takes different values. Look from whole, all the values of QGNDDs change steadily. ND1, ND3 and ND5 are increasing gradually but ND4 declines slowly. In particular, there is not dramatic change for ND2. Moreover, whenθν242∈[2.1,2.3], ND3 is greater than ND1. On the contrary, when p3∈(2.3, +∞), ND1 is greater than ND3.As shown in Fig. 6, it is observed that the best alternatives may be different with respect to different parameter values ofλμ121. For differentλμ121, the ranking order of alternatives has changed dramatically. The values of ND3, ND4 and ND5 first increase and then decrease with the increase ofλμ121, whereas the value of ND1 first decreases and then increases with the increase ofλμ121.It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the ranking results may be not identical for different parameter values ofdμ342. QGNDDs change dramatically whendμ342∈[0.1,0.4]∪[1.7,1.9]. However, whendμ342∈[0.4,1.7], QGNDDs for each alternatives are almost invariable.In this subsection, we compare the results obtained by Zeng et al.’s method [35] and Liao et al.’s method [36] with the proposed method in this paper to explain the superiorities of the proposed method.Based on the similarity degree between the individual IFPRs and the collective one, Zeng et al. [35] developed a method for solving GDM in which the preference information given by experts takes the form of IFPRs. Assume that experts’ weight vector isw=13,13,13Tand the deadline of acceptable similarity α0=0.45. Using Zeng et al.’s method [35] to solve the above RFID technology selection example, the rank of the alternatives is generated as x2≻x1≻x4≻x3≻x5, which is different with the results in this paper.Liao et al. [36] proposed a framework of intuitionistic fuzzy GDM and a step by step procedure to solve such problems. Assume experts’ weights are set to be equal, the minimum majority degree λ=2/3, the minimum consensus degree γ=0.8 and the consistency threshold ξ=0.8. Then we use the method [36] to solve the above example and obtain the ranking order of the alternatives as x4≻x1≻x2≻x3≻x5, which is just the same as that obtained by optimistic approach in this paper.Compared with the methods [35,36], the proposed method has some technical merits as follows:(1)The methods [35,36] assumed that all experts have no significant difference in advance and did not consider the determination of experts’ weights. Giving experts’ weights a priori makes it difficult to avoid the subjective randomness in the methods [35,36]. By contrast, experts’ weights are objectively determined by constructing an intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model in this paper, which can effectively reduce subjectivity and improve convincingness of decision results.The method [35] needs to predefine the deadline α0 to judge the acceptable similarity of IFPRs. In decision problems, it is not easy for experts to give accurate and suitable parameter values. Meanwhile, the method [35] merely considered the acceptable similarity degree between individual and collective IFPRs and neglected the rejection degree. However, to achieve higher group consensus as well as possible, we construct an intuitionistic fuzzy linear programming model considering rejection degree of equality relation together with the degree of its acceptance simultaneously. Therefore, the proposed method is more comprehensive and consistent with real-world decision situations.It is required to solve many programming models in the method [36]. If more experts participate the decision making, large deviation may occur between the evaluation information provided by experts. Some judgments conditions, such asCR(l)>ξand Ψ<φ, may be unsatisfied, which can lead to the case of no solution for these programming models using the method [36]. Therefore, the proposed method is more time-saving and more efficient than the method [36].The ranking result obtained by the method [36] is just a special case of that obtained by the proposed method, i.e., it is only consistent with the result obtained by optimistic approach in this paper since the method [36] failed to consider experts’ risk preferences. Moreover, the method [35] also ignored experts’ risk attitude. In fact, in real-world decision problems, different experts have diverse attitudes toward risk. It is necessary and natural to incorporate experts’ risk preference into the decision making process. We respectively develop optimistic, pessimistic and mixed approaches to deriving experts’ weights sufficiently considering experts’ risk preference. Hence, the proposed method is able to provide experts with more choices and thus has better flexibility and agility.The proposed intuitionistic fuzzy programming method is extremely flexible. Subsection 4.1 only considers different non-membership functions for different approaches. The membership functions for optimistic, pessimistic and mixed approaches are just the same (i.e., Eq. (19)). In this section, we extend the membership functions to more general linear forms.For optimistic approach, whenμijl(w)=0,Hijl(w)must be equal to zero and cannot alter in the interval−Δijl,ΔijlΔijl>0because of constraintμijl(w)+νijl(w)≤1. Hence, the membership function in optimistic approach cannot be extended.For pessimistic approach, the non-membership function forHijl(w)=˜IF0is also Eq. (24) while the membership function can be extended to more general forms as follows:(31)μijl(w)=1,if−Δijl≤Hijl(w)≤ΔijlHijl(w)−θijlΔijl−θijl,ifΔijl<Hijl(w)≤θijlHijl(w)+θijlθijl−Δijl,if−θijl≤Hijl(w)<−Δijl0,elsewhereθijl>λijl>0,θijl−λijl>Δijl>0andμijl(w)+νijl(w)≤1(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q).In this case, the membership and non-membership functions of intuitionistic fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜IF0are depicted in Fig. 8.Similar to Eq. (25), the corresponding linear programming model can be derived as(32)max{η−ϑ}s.t.ηθμijl−Δμijl−θμijl≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl−ηθμijl−Δμijl(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−θμijl−λμijl(ϑ−1)≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl+λμijl(ϑ−1)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)ηθνijl−Δνijl−θνijl≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl−ηθνijl−Δνijl(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>il=1,2,…,q);−θνijl−λνijl(ϑ−1)≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl+λνijl(ϑ−1)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)η≥ϑ,ϑ≥0,η+ϑ≤1,∑k=1qwk=1,wk≥0(k=1,2,…,q)For mixed approach, the non-membership function forHijl(w)=˜IF0is also Eq. (26) while the membership function can be extended to more general forms as follows:(33)μijl(w)=1,if−Δijl≤Hijl(w)≤ΔijlHijl(w)−θijlΔijl−θijl,ifΔijl<Hijl(w)≤θijlHijl(w)+θijlθijl−Δijl,if−θijl≤Hijl(w)<−Δijl0,elsewhereβijl>αijl>0,θijl+αijl−βijl>Δijl>0andμijl(w)+νijl(w)≤1(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q).In this case, the membership and non-membership functions of intuitionistic fuzzy constraintHijl(w)=˜IF0are depicted in Fig. 9.Similar to Eq. (27), the corresponding linear programming model can be derived as(34)max{η−ϑ}s.t.−θμijl−ηθμijl−Δμijl≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl−ηθμijl−Δμijl(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−θμijl+αμijl+βμijl(ϑ−1)≤μijl−∑k=1qwkμijk≤θμijl+αμijl+βμijl(ϑ−1)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−θνijl−ηθνijl−Δνijl≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl−ηθνijl−Δνijl(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)−θνijl+ανijl+βνijl(ϑ−1)≤νijl−∑k=1qwkνijk≤θνijl+ανijl+βνijl(ϑ−1)(i,j=1,2,…,n;j>i;l=1,2,…,q)η≥ϑ,ϑ≥0,η+ϑ≤1,∑k=1qwk=1,wk≥0(k=1,2,…,q)Hence, the above discussion shows that the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy programming method in this paper has better flexibility and agility and can meet the demands for different experts.
