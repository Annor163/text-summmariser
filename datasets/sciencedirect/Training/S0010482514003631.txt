The qualitative detection of decreases in cardiac output

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We collected routinely monitored data from patients during anaesthesia.We determined when significant changes in variables occurred using runs analysis.Significant changes in multiple variables were used to suggest possible diagnoses.End-tidal carbon dioxide decreased when a fall in cardiac output diagnosed.End-tidal carbon dioxide did not decrease significantly without this diagnosis.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cardiac output (CO), the most fundamental of circulatory parameters, is difficult to measure. When comparing new devices for cardiac output measurement Cecconi et al. [1] stress the importance of knowing the precision and accuracy of the ‘gold standard’ reference technique; the most common referenced ‘gold standard’ technique being intermittent thermodilution (ITD) using an averaged set of measurements.Critchley and Critchley [2] suggest that ITD measurements have a precision of 10–20% and the view of Cecconi et al. [1] is that the error associated with a measuring technique is related to the size of the smallest change, that can be measured by the device, that can be recognised as a real change. The usually accepted 10% CE [coefficient of error] for ITD means that a change can only be trusted as real only if it is greater than 28.3%. However, a study by Nilsson et al. [3] showed that to be 95% confident of accuracy within 5% an average of four measurements are required and two sets of such measurements need to differ by at least 7% before a change in cardiac output can be accepted.Using ITD, Weil et al. [4] studied post cardiac arrest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in pigs and reported that, in the presence of constant ventilation, the mean end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and cardiac output (CO) decreased to 21% and 33% respectively during CPR, and they showed a correlation of 0.79 (p<0.001) between CO and EtCO2. Omato et al. measured cardiac output (ITD) and EtCO2 during controlled arterial haemorrhage [5]. They suggested a logarithmic relationship between CO and EtCO2 (r=0.91, p<0.001). Idris et al. in 1994 [6] confirmed a close relationship between CO and EtCO2 in a well-controlled study of ventilation and cardiac output. The cardiac index (CI) ranged from 0 to 5.37mL/min/m2 and correlated significantly (p<0.0001) with PETCO2.If physiological changes in blood pressure, heart rate and pulse amplitude suggest hypovolaemia and there is a concurrent decrease in EtCO2 then it is possible to deduce that the cardiac output has possibly decreased secondary to the hypovolaemia (this is exemplified by a study by Jones et al. [7]); assuming no change in ventilation or metabolic rate.The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how routinely monitored physiological variables may detect changes that are indicative of a fall in cardiac output associated with hypovolaemia.
