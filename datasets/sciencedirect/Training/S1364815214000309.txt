@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The GroundWater Spatiotemporal Data Analysis Tool (GWSDAT) is a user friendly, open source, decision support tool for the analysis and reporting of groundwater monitoring data. Uniquely, GWSDAT applies a spatiotemporal model smoother for a more coherent and smooth interpretation of the interaction in spatial and time-series components of groundwater solute concentrations. Data entry is via a standardised Microsoft Excel input template whilst the underlying statistical modelling and graphical output are generated using the open source statistical program R. This paper describes in detail the various plotting options available and how the graphical user interface can be used for rapid, rigorous and interactive trend analysis with facilitated report generation. GWSDAT has been used extensively in the assessment of soil and groundwater conditions at Shell's downstream assets and the discussion section describes the benefits of its applied use. Finally, some consideration is given to possible future developments.GWSDAT (GroundWater Spatiotemporal Data Analysis Tool)Wayne R.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the interests of user-friendliness and productivity the results of a GWSDAT analysis are interrogated and interpreted through the GWSDAT user interface (see Fig. 2). It includes a wide range of different plots for the visual inspection of groundwater monitoring data. The objective assessment of trend is achieved by the application of statistical smoothing models described in Appendix A. The following sections describe the individual components of the GWSDAT user interface in more detail.The well trend plot (see Fig. 3) enables the user to investigate time series trends of solute concentrations and groundwater level in individual wells. Sampled concentration values are displayed using orange circles for non-detect data and black solid circles for detectable data. The user can choose to overlay a linear (or log-linear) regression model fit and use the non-parametric Mann–Kendall approach to trend detection via the R package Kendall (McLeod, 2011). Although this approach is widely used in environmental sciences (e.g. Hirsch et al. (1982); Helsel and Hirsch (2002)) its major weakness is that it can only detect monotonic trend and in response GWSDAT adopts an additional methodology. The solid blue line in Fig. 3 displays the estimate (together with a 95% confidence interval) of the mean trend level according to a local linear regression model fit described in Appendix A.1. This non-parametric model smoothing technique is not constrained to be monotonic and can change direction as is clearly illustrated in the figure. The trend between two points in time is, informally speaking, deemed statistically significant if the associated confidence intervals do not overlap (Fig. 4).For evaluating the impact of changing (perhaps seasonal) water table conditions groundwater elevation data can, optionally, be overlaid in this plot. The time series of observed groundwater level is represented by open circles joined by a black solid line see and the values read off from the right hand axis (see Fig. 3). If present, NAPL thickness data can also be displayed in a similar manner.The trend and threshold indicator matrix is a summary of the level and time-series trend in solute concentrations at a particular time-slice of the monitoring period. The rows correspond to each monitoring well and the columns correspond to the different solutes. The date of the time-slice is displayed at the top of the plot and also indicated by a vertical grey line in the well trend plot (see Fig. 3). The user can select between the options of displaying ‘Trend’, ‘Threshold – Absolute’ or ‘Threshold Statistical’.When ‘Trend’ is selected the cells are coloured to indicate the strength and direction of the current trend as assessed by the instantaneous gradient of the well trend smoother (see Section 4.2) at the current time-slice. White cells indicate a generally flat trend whilst reds and greens indicate strong upward and downward trends, respectively. In the event that the trend cannot be calculated (e.g. no data) then the corresponding cell is coloured grey. Blue cells represent non-detect data.When ‘Threshold Absolute’ is selected the cells are coloured according to whether the observed current solute concentrations are below a user specified threshold value, such as a risk-based remedial objective. The cells are coloured red if the current solute concentration is above the threshold value and green otherwise. ‘Threshold Statistical’ is similar but only colours the cell green if the upper 95% confidence interval of the well trend smoother (see Section 4.2) is below the threshold value.The GWSDAT spatial plot (see Fig. 5) is for the analysis of spatial trends in solute concentrations, groundwater flow and, if present, NAPL thickness. It displays the locations of the named monitoring wells together with sample solute concentration values collected within the date interval displayed at the top of the graphic. If desired, the major site features (e.g. roads, fuel tanks), supplied in a GIS shapefile format, can be overlaid on the spatial plot as light blue lines. As the user increments forwards and backwards through the monitoring history, using the ‘+’ and ‘−’ Time Steps buttons, the spatial plot is updated.The estimated groundwater flow direction and magnitude is depicted with blue arrows calculated using the method described in Appendix A.2. Additionally, it is possible to overlay a contour plot of groundwater elevation. This is achieved by drawing isopleths through a fitted local polynomial regression model fit implemented using the R function loess – a 2D variant of the local linear regression method explained in Appendix A.1.The spatial distribution of solute concentration is estimated by taking a time-slice through the spatiotemporal concentration smoother (discussed further in Section 4.5). The model predictions are superposed on the spatial plot with a user-specified colour key located to the right of the plot. Alternatively, if no model based predictions are required, the concentration smoother can be replaced by size scaled colour coded circles representing the magnitude of sampled solute concentration values. If NAPL is present, the additional ‘NAPL-Circles’ option is available which displays NAPL thickness measurements at the monitoring well locations using a similar circle based representation, i.e. a bubble-plot.The spatial plot uses the R packages, sp (Pebesma and Bivand, 2005), splancs (Rowlingson et al., 2012) and maptools (Lewin-Koh et al., 2012).One of GWSDAT's unique features is that the spatial and temporal components of the solute concentration data are modelled jointly in a single modelling framework described in Appendix A.3. The simultaneous statistical smoothing of both spatial and temporal components provides a clearer and more insightful interpretation of the groundwater monitoring site solute characteristics than would otherwise be gleaned from analysing these two components separately. However, it is not an inconsiderable challenge to effectively communicate the 3-dimensional nature of spatiotemporal trend through a 2-dimensional medium of a computer monitor. Furthermore, there is an additional constraint that the output from a GWSDAT analysis is commonly used in paper-based non-interactive reports submitted to environmental regulators. For this reason, GWSDAT communicates spatiotemporal trend through automatic plotting of the full temporal sequence of spatial plots (see Section 4.4). This animation based approach provides a ‘movie’ clearly illustrating how both the spatial and temporal distribution of historical groundwater solute concentrations have changed over the monitoring period.The ‘animations’ menu located at the top-left of the GWSDAT user interface (Fig. 2) provides three different methods for generating animations. The first method plots and records the full sequence of spatial plots in an R graphics window. The user can toggle forwards and backwards through the sequence of spatial plots using the ‘Page Up’ and ‘Page Down’ keyboard buttons. The second method is identical but additionally generates a Microsoft PowerPoint slide-pack of the full sequence of spatial plots. The third method uses the R package animation (Xie, 2012), to generate a html animation page (with controls) of spatial plots in the user's internet browser. The html animation can be viewed independently of GWSDAT, and hence provides an excellent dynamic media for communicating results to individuals who do not have direct access to GWSDAT.By left-clicking on any of the GWSDAT user interface plots, an identical but expanded plot is generated in a separate R graphics window. Plots can be saved to a variety of different formats including ‘jpeg’, ‘postscript’, ‘pdf’, ‘metafile’. Alternatively, with a single click of a mouse, plots and sequences of plots (e.g. spatiotemporal animation described in Section 4.5) can be diverted directly in to Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. This functionality, implemented using the R package RDCOMClient (Lang, 2012), enables the user to interactively compile a site groundwater monitoring report in an expeditious manner.Additional report generation functionality include the ‘Well Reporting’ procedure, implemented using the R package lattice (Sarkar, 2008), which generates a matrix of graphs displaying time series solute concentration values on a well by well basis (see Fig. 6). This plot can be used to very concisely summarise the time series trends in the complete set of solutes and monitoring wells. A similar report procedure ‘GW Well Reporting’ also allows for the overlay of the time series in groundwater elevation at each well. Finally, the ‘Latest Snapshot’ procedure generates a sequence of plots (to PowerPoint if required) which reports on the most recent trends. This includes the latest spatial plot for each solute together with the most recent three variants of the ‘Trend and Threshold Indicator Matrix’ plot described in Section 4.3.
