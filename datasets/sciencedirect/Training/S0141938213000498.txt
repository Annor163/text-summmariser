@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Ca (or Sr)TiO3:Eu3+, M (Li+ or Na+ or K+) and CaTiO3:Pr3+, M (Li+ or Na+ or Ag+ or K+ or Gd3+ or La3+) powders were prepared by combustion synthesis method and the samples were further heated to ∼1000°C to improve the crystallinity. The structure and morphology of materials were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The morphologies of SrTiO3:Eu3+, CaTiO3:Eu3+ or CaTiO3:Pr3+ powders co-doped with other metal ions were very similar. Small and coagulated particles of nearly cubical shapes with small size distribution having smooth and regular surface were formed. Photo-luminescence spectra of CaTiO3:Pr3+ and co-doped either with Li+, Na+, K+, Ag+, La3+ or Gd3+ ions showed red emissions at 613nm due to the 1D2→3H4 transition of Pr3+. The variation of intensity of emission peak with different co-doping follows the order: K+>Ag+>Na+>Li+>La3+>Gd3+. The characteristic emissions of CaTiO3:Eu3+ lattices had strong emission at 614 and 620nm for 5D0→7F2 with other weak transitions observed at 580, 592, 654, 705nm for 5D0→7Fn transitions where n=0, 1, 3, 4 respectively in all host lattices. Photoluminescence intensity in SrTiO3:Eu3+ is more than CaTiO3:Eu3+ lattices. A remarkable increase of photoluminescence intensity (in 5D0→7F2 transition) was observed if co-doped with Li+ ions in CaTiO3:Eu3+ and SrTiO3:Eu3+.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recently, the MTiO3 (M=Ca or Sr) perovskites have attracted considerable attention as an important class of mixed oxides with various applications owing to their physical properties as candidates for electro-optical devices. Calcium titanate (CT) ceramics are excellent applicants for use as dielectric resonators in wireless communication system [1]. In addition, CT exhibits a high permittivity of 160, accompanied however by a large positive temperature coefficient of resonant frequency value (+850ppm/°C) [2]. On the other hand strontium titanate (SrTiO3) has its potential applications, such as dynamic random access memory, tunable microwave devices, photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen [3–5]. Rare earth ions are used to dope perovskite-type oxides as a probe to investigate local centers and energy [6,7] promoting changes in the optical behavior [8], or improve the capacitance response of these materials making possible their use as high frequency ultrasonic transducers [9]. Eu3+ and Pr3+ ions have significant importance due to their potential application as red phosphors, electroluminescent devices, optical amplifiers and lasers, as dopants in a great variety of materials [10,11]. In order to enhance the luminescence properties, many researchers have concentrated on varying the concentration of praseodymium or europium, charge compensators like Al3+, In3+, Ga3+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Li+ ions [7–15] and synthesis methods [16–19]. In many applications like photocatalysts and phosphors, MTiO3 nano particles with narrow size distribution, non-agglomeration and spherical morphology are preferred [20].It is well known that the preparative methods have important effects on material microstructure and physical properties. The combustion synthesis method had been used earlier by us to prepare phosphor materials of ZrO2, BaZrO3 and MLn2O4 (M=Ba or Sr, Ln=Gd or La) doped with Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions [21,22]. This method provides an interesting alternative over other elaborated techniques because it offers several advantages such as: simplicity of experimental set-up; surprisingly short time between the preparation of reactants and the availability of the final product; and being cheap due to energy saving. The main advantage of this method is the rapid decomposition of the rare earth nitrate in the presence of an organic fuel. During the reaction, many gases, such as CO2, N2, NO2 and H2O, with enormous heat are released in a short period of time before the process terminates with white, foamy and crispy products. Moreover, final products are found to be composed of nanosized particles. Present work has been carried out with the aim to prepare and compare the high intensity photoluminescence nano-sized crystalline powders of CaTiO3 and SrTiO3 doped with Eu3+ or Pr3+ and co-doped with charge compensators like Li+ or Na+ or Ag+ or K+ or Gd3+ or La3+ etc, after sintering at 1000°C. The effect of different charge compensator ions in perovskites lattices has been proposed to enhance the luminescence intensity as well as the possible mechanism. The crystalline structure and morphology of prepared materials have also been discussed. The crystalline structure of prepared materials, morphology of particles and their photoluminescence properties are characterized by XRD, SEM and emission spectroscopy.High purity TiO2, [Ca(NO3)2], [Sr(NO3)2], [Eu(NO3)3], [Pr(NO3)3], [La(NO3)3], [Gd(NO3)3], NaNO3, KNO3, LiNO3, AgNO3 and Hexamethylenetetraamine [HMTA] were purchased from Aldrich chemicals as starting materials. Eu3+ or Pr3+ and N+ or N3+ doped nanocrystals (N=Li, Na, K, Ag, La, Gd) with general formula (1−2x) CaTiO3x Pr3+, x N+ or 3+, and (1−6x)Sr (or Ca)TiO3 5x Eu3+, x N+ where x is 1 mole%, were prepared by heating an aqueous concentrated paste rapidly, containing calculated amounts of metal nitrates and HMTA in a preheated furnace maintained at 500°C. HMTA was used as a fuel and its amount was calculated using total oxidizing and reducing valences [23]. In such cases, the material undergoes rapid dehydration and foaming followed by decomposition, generating combustible gases. These volatile combustible gases ignite and burn with a flame, yielding a voluminous solid. In the present case, the combustion process utilized the enthalpy of combustion for the formation of the required solid material and the solid thus obtained was again fired at 1000°C for 3h to increase the brightness and crystallinity.The morphologies of the prepared crystals were studied by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) using a JEOL JSM6300 operating at 10kV. Photoluminescence (PL) experiments were performed in backscattering geometry using a He–Cd laser (325nm) with an optical power of 30mW for excitation. The emitted light was analyzed by HR-4000 Ocean Optics USB spectrometer optimized for the UV–Vis range. For photoluminescence measurements, 0.05g powder samples were pressed into pellets (10mm diameter and 1mm thickness) and then exposed to a 325 nm He–Cd laser. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The structural characterization of the solids was performed by high resolution XRD using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer in the θ–2θ configuration and using CuKα radiation (1.54184Å).
