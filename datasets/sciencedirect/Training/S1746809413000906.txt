@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often contaminated by various kinds of noise or artifacts, for example, morphological changes due to motion artifact, non-stationary noise due to muscular contraction (EMG), etc. Some of these contaminations severely affect the usefulness of ECG signals, especially when computer aided algorithms are utilized. In this paper, a novel ECG enhancement algorithm is proposed based on sparse derivatives. By solving a convex ℓ1 optimization problem, artifacts are reduced by modeling the clean ECG signal as a sum of two signals whose second and third-order derivatives (differences) are sparse respectively. The algorithm is applied to a QRS detection system and validated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database (109,452 anotations), resulting a sensitivity of Se = 99.87% and a positive prediction of +P = 99.88%.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In real world scenarios, an ECG recording is often corrupted by various kinds of noise and artifacts [1], e.g., electrode contact noise, motion artifacts, muscle contraction (EMG), etc., which severely limit its usefulness. Simple frequency-selective filtering and some general denoising technics [2–5] aiming mainly for stationary noise usually underperform because of (1) the partial overlap of signal and noise bandwidths. (2) The presence of the non-stationary noise or artifacts. Thus in recent years, more sophisticated algorithms have been devised to enhance ECG signals, for example [6–8], etc. Some of them are based on projecting the ECG signal onto different signal subspaces, some are based on statistical or nonlinear dynamical models. Among all these models, the polynomial approximation based methods [9,3,4] are shown suitable for applications where preserving features of local maximas and minimas of an ECG are important [10,11].Since there is no absolute clean ECG signal, a question should be clarified is, in what sense or by what means the performance of an algorithm can be evaluated. One approach is to simulate both synthetic ECG signal and noise and then measure the difference, for example, the mean square error (MSE) between the recovered signal and the original signal. However, the quality of the simulation can sometimes affect the evaluation. Another approach is to test on real ECG signals and verify the result in applications, for example, ECG delineation, compression, QRS complex detection etc.For the past decade, sparse signal representations for signal processing has been an active research field. Many algorithms based on sparsity have been developed for signal denoising, reconstruction, deconvolution, etc. For example, the lasso [12] or basis pursuit denoising (BPD) problem [13] solve the following optimization:(1)argminx∥y−x∥22+λR(x)where x is a signal of length N and y is the noisy observation of x. The regularizerR(x)=∑i=0N−1|xi|is chosen to promote the sparsity of the solution of x. The positive constant λ is the regularization parameter. Increasing λ has the effect of making the solution x more sparse.When R(x) is modified as:R(x)=∑i=0N−1|xi−xi−1|instead of sparsity of the solution of x, it promotes the sparsity of the first-order difference of the solution of x. The problem is then known as total variation (TV) denoising [14]. Some other examples are given in [15–20], which discussed nonlinear signal decomposition based on sparse representations.This paper proposes the enhancement of ECG signals by modeling the ECG signal y(t) as the sum of two functions, i.e., y(t)=x1(t)+x2(t), where x1(t) is constrained such that its second-order derivative is sparse, and x2(t) is constrained such that its third-order derivative is sparse. As such, x1(t) is approximately a linear spline (piecewise linear), while x2(t) is approximately a quadratic spline (piecewise quadratic). In this approach, the function x1(t) (i.e., a linear spline-like function) is understood to be continuous but not differentiable, while the function x2(t) (i.e., a quadratic spline-like function) is continuously differentiable. The simultaneous use of two splines, of differing orders, gives the proposed model the ability to accurately reproduce the behavior of the ECG signal: the ECG waveform typically contains peaks (the QRS segment) where a piecewise linear model is suitable. Yet the ECG waveform also contains components that are not well approximated by a linear function; for these segments, a second order polynomial is more suitable.The proposed approach for ECG enhancement models the ECG signal as (approximately) the sum of two splines, of different orders, but it does not explicitly constrain the two functions to splines exactly. Exact spline models have two disadvantages: They are overly simplified for real ECG waveforms, and they require a suitable set of knots being identified. For ECG signals contaminated by noise and artifacts, most parametric models will likely have these deficiencies. Hence, the proposed approach reflects this multi-spline model (linear spline plus quadratic splines) by jointly optimizing the sparsity of the 2nd- and 3rd-order derivatives of the functions x1(t) and x2(t) respectively.For the joint optimization of the sparsity of the derivatives of the model components, x1(t) and x2(t), we describe a suitable convex non-differentiable optimization problem. Using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) [21–23], we derive a computationally efficient algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the global minimizer. The proposed approach is evaluated for the purpose of ECG noise/artifact attenuation and for QRS detection.The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some notations are defined and the total variation denoising problem is re-visited with more detail. In Section 3, the proposed ECG enhancement algorithm, namely Sparse Derivative Denoising (SDD), is discussed with examples. In Section 4, we describe a complete automatic QRS detection system to show how the proposed ECG enhancement method helps increase the overall detection accuracy. As the QRS detection problem is itself of value, the system is applied to the whole MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database and the performance is compared to some other state-of-art methods.In this paper, lower case bold and upper case bold are used to denote vector and matrix, e.g., vector g and matrix G. The N point signal x is denoted as(2)x=x0,x1,…,xN−1tSince the work is illustrated in discrete time domain, all derivatives will be expressed by differences and the words ‘derivative’ and ‘difference’ are exchangeable in the following.The first-order difference matrix of size (N−1)×N is defined asD1=−11−11⋱⋱−11Similarly, the second-order difference matrix of size (N−2)×N is defined asD2=−12−1−12−1⋱⋱⋱−12−1Generally, the difference operator of order k, of size (N−k)×N, is denoted as Dk.The ℓpnorm, when p≥1 is defined as(3)||x||p=(|x1|p+|x2|p+⋯+|xN|p)1pSpecifically, when p=1, (3) becomes(4)∥x∥1=|x1|+|x2|+⋯+|xN|.When p=2, (3) becomes(5)∥x∥2=|x1|2+|x2|2+⋯+|xN|2.The notation ∥x∥0 is used to denote the total number of non-zero entries in x.Total variation denoising refers to the problem(6)argminx12∥y−x∥22+λ∥D1x∥1or(7a)argminx∥D1x∥1(7b)subjectto∥y−x∥2≤rProblems (6) and (7) solve the same problem given that a suitable λ is chosen and the Euclidean distance between y and x (value of r) is known. They seek to find an estimate of the original signal x from noisy data y, where x is modeled to have a sparse first-order difference.There is no explicit solution to (6), but a direct algorithm to compute the exact solution is recently available [24]. We will denote the solution to (6) asTVD(y,λ)The method of total variation denoising can be extended by solving the following cost function, namely, compound TV denoising [25]:(8)argminx12∥y−x∥22+λ1∥D1x∥1+λ2∥D2x∥1It simultaneously penalizes the first-order and second-order difference of x, implying that x has both sparse first-order and second-order differences.Consider the test signal y in Fig. 1(a) which is composed of piecewise constant and piecewise linear components. The first and second-order difference of y are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c). It is clear that D1y and D2y are more sparse than y, however, two more things can be observed: (1) D1y is sparse only where y is piecewise constant. (2) D2y is less sparse compared to D1y at the place where D1y is sparse. Next, we let y=x1+x2 as shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b) where x1 is the piecewise constant component of y and x2 is the piecewise linear component. The first-order difference of x1 and second-order difference of x2 are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). Now comparing Figs. 1 and 2, the total number of spikes in Fig. 2(c) and (d), which equals∥D1x1∥0+∥D2x2∥0is less than the number of spikes in either D1y or D2y alone. The reason is that a piecewise constant signal becomes most sparse after taking first-order difference while a piecewise linear signal becomes most sparse after taking second-order difference. In another word, if somehow we are able to decompose a signal y that contains both piecewise constant component and piecewise linear component into one piecewise constant signal x1 and one piecewise linear signal x2, then∥D1x1∥0+∥D2x2∥0is smaller than ∥y∥0 and∥Dky∥0for any k. To achieve this decomposition, we propose the following optimization problem:(9a)argminx1,x2∥D1x1∥0+∥D2x2∥0(9b)subjecttoy=x1+x2However, (9) is not a convex optimization problem and its solution is not easily accessed. As ℓ1 is known as a convex proxy of sparsity, we modify (9) and propose a convex optimization problem. More specifically, we use∥D1x1∥1and∥D2x2∥1instead of∥D1x1∥0and∥D2x2∥0in (9) and introduce two regularization parameters λ1 and λ2:(10a)argminx1,x2λ1∥D1x1∥1+λ2∥D2x2∥1(10b)subjecttoy=x1+x2Eq. (10) is the sparse derivative decomposition problem.Next, we consider another model wherein the signal x=x1+x2 is observed in additive noise,(11)y=x1+x2+nWe seek to find an estimates of x1 and x2, denoted asxˆ1andxˆ2, such thaty−xˆ1−xˆ2resembles the noise n. Moreover,xˆ1andxˆ2are modeled to have sparse first- and second-order differences respectively. This can be formulated as following:(12)argminx1,x2∥y−x1−x2∥2+λ1∥D1x1∥1+λ2∥D2x2∥1or(13a)argminx1,x2λ1∥D1x1∥1+λ2∥D2x2∥1(13b)subjectto∥y−x1−x2∥2≤rProblems (12) and (13) are referred as Sparse Derivative Denoising (SDD). A solution to problem (12) has been given in [26] and the algorithm to (13) will be given in Section 3.2.Example 3.1The test signal from Fig. 1(a) is corrupted by white Gaussian noise with signal to noise ratio (SNR) 20dB as shown in Fig. 3(a). The denoised signals after applying SDD and some other denoising technics (total variation denoising [14], compound total variation denoising [25], EMD based denoising [5] and a wavelet method) are shown in Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 4. Compared to other methods, the SDD achieves better recovery for both constant component and linear component and the SNR also indicates that SDD outperforms the others.In this section, the above concept is extended to higher order derivatives so that the features of ECG signal can be properly captured.Consider the problem(14a)argminx1,x2λ1∥D2x1∥1+λ2∥D3x2∥1(14b)subjectto∥y−x1−x2∥2≤rThe cost function models the observed signal y as y=x1+x2+n, where x1 is a quasi piecewise linear signal which has sparse second-order difference, x2 is a quasi piecewise quadratic signal which has sparse third-order difference and n is the noise or artifacts in ECG signal.Problem (14) can be solved using variable splitting with Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). After variable splitting, (14) is rewritten as(15a)argminv1,v2,v3,v4,x1,x2λ1∥D1v1∥1+λ2∥D1v2∥1(15b)subjectto∥y−v4∥2≤r(15c)v1=D1x1(15d)v2=D2x2(15e)v3=x1(15f)v4=x1+x2Note that the constraints can be expressed in a matrix form,(16)v=Gxwhere(17)G=D100D2I0II(18)v=v1t,v2t,v3t,v4tt;(19)x=x1t,x2tt;The augmented Lagrangian for (15) is(20)L=λ1∥D1v1∥1+λ2∥D1v2∥1+μ∥v1−D1x1+d1∥22+μ∥v2−D2x2+d2∥22+μ∥v3−x1+d3∥22+μ∥v4−x1−x2+d4∥22subjectto∥y−v4∥2≤rNext, L is minimized by ADMM as following:(21a)v1,v2,v3,v4←argminv1,v2,v3,v4λ1∥D1v1∥1+λ2∥D1v2∥1+μ∥v1−D1x1+d1∥22+μ∥v2−D2x2+d2∥22+μ∥v3−x1+d3∥22+μ∥v4−x1−x2+d4∥22subjectto∥y−v4∥2≤r(21b)x1,x2←argminx1,x2μ∥v1−D1x1+d1∥22+μ∥v3−x1+d3∥22+μ∥v4−x1−x2+d4∥22(21c)d1←d1+v1−D1x1(21d)d2←d2+v2−D2x2(21e)d3←d3+v3−x1(21f)d4←d4+v4−x1−x2(21g)gobackto(21a)The minimization of v1, v2, v3, v4 are separable, thus can be solved independently. However, x1, x2 are not separable, thus have to be solved jointly. Lettingd=d1t,d2t,d3t,d4tt, problem (21) can be written as (22):(22a)v1←argminv1λ1∥D1v1∥1+μ∥v1−D1x1+d1∥22(22b)v2←argminv2λ2∥D1v2∥1+μ∥v2−D2x2+d2∥22(22c)v3←argminv3∥v3−x1+d3∥22(22d)v4←argminv4∥v4−x1−x2+d4∥22subjectto∥y−v4∥2≤r(22e)x←argminx∥v−Gx+d∥22(22f)d←d+v−Gx(22g)gobackto(22a)Problems (22a) and (22b) are TV denoising problems as described in Section 2.2 and the solutions are given by(23)v1←TVDD1x1−d1,λ1μ1(24)v2←TVDD2x2−d2,λ2μ2Problem (22c) is trivial and the solution is the simple update:(25)v3←x1−d3The solution to (22d) can be expressed as(26)v4←projball(x1+x2−d4,y,r)where projball(a, b, r) denotes the projection of point a onto the ball center at b with radius r. It is given explicitly by(27)projball(a,b,r):=b+r∥a−b∥2a−b,∥a−b∥2>ra,∥a−b∥2≤rFinally, (22e) is an ℓ2 minimization problem and has a closed form solution(28)x←GtG−1Gtv+dNote that(29)GtG=D1tD1+2IIID2tD2+2Iis a full rank matrix and since all block matrices in GtG are sparse matrices, GtG is sparse. Therefore, existing efficient algorithms for solving sparse system of linear equations can be applied to (28). Complete algorithm for problem (14) is listed as Algorithm 3.1.Convergence. Since (14) is a convex optimization problem, the local minimum is also the global minimum. In addition, the matrix G in Eq. (17) is of full column rank. With these two conditions, the convergence of the cost function to its global minimum is guaranteed by Theorem 1 in [22].The following examples illustrate the use of SDD for ECG signal deonising:Example 3.2A 3s synthetic ECG signal with sampling rate 360Hz (Fig. 5(a)) is generated using the algorithm from [27]. The signal is contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise as in Fig. 5(b). After applying SDD, the denoised signalxˆ1+xˆ2, the second-order derivative ofxˆ1and the third-order derivative ofxˆ2are shown in Fig. 5(c)–(e). From Fig. 5(d) and (e), it is clear that the second and third-order derivative ofxˆ1andxˆ2are sparse and spikes almost only exist where the morphology behaviors of the ECG change. The cost function history and constraint function history are plotted in Fig. 6.Example 3.3This example shows SDD's ability to deal with non-stationary noise which exists in real ECG recordings. The test signal (Fig. 7(a)) is obtained from record 231 of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database [28]. As is described in Section 3.C of [29], signals of this type pose major difficulty to most QRS detection methods because of the low SNR, or more specifically, the non-stationary noise (EMG for example). By carefully examining the test signal, noise from 4 to 5.5s has significantly higher power than average. After applying SDD, Fig. 7(b) shows that the artifact is almost completely removed while the heights of P, R, T peaks of the ECG signal are well-preserved. The results of low-pass filtering (Kaiser window with cut-off frequency 20Hz, 60dB roll-off), EMD-based denoising [5] and LASIP [3,4] are also displayed in Fig. 7(c)–(e) for comparison. While the artifacts are removed to a certain degree after low-pass filtering and EMD-based denoising, the QRS peaks are not well preserved. The LASIP method is capable of well preserving the feature points since it is a set of methods based on Savitzky-Golay filtering and adaptive selection of sliding windows, however, comparing with SDD, after applying LASIP, considerable amount of noise remains.Algorithm 3.1Constrained sparse derivative denoising(30a)Initialilzeμ,d1,d2,d3,d4v1←TVDD1x1−d1,λ1μ(30b)v2←TVDD2x2−d2,λ2μ(30c)v3←x1−d3(30d)v4←projball(x1+x2−d4,y,r)(30e)x←GtG−1Gtv+d(30f)d1←d1+v1−D1x1(30g)d2←d2+v2−D2x2(30h)d3←d3+v3−x1(30i)d4←d4+v4−x1−x2RepeatorstoponconvergenceThe sparsity of SDD can be further enhanced by exploiting the re-weighted ℓ1 process proposed in [30]. Consider the cost function(31a)argminx1,x2λ1R1(x1)+λ2R2(x2)(31b)subjectto∥y−x1−x2∥2≤rwhere(31c)R1(v)=∥W1D2v∥1(31d)R2(v)=∥W2D3v∥1This is a more general form of problem (14) where W1 and W2 are two diagonal matrices with diagonalw1=w11,w12,...,w1(N−2)tandw2=w21,w22,...,w2(N−3)t.In the re-weighted process, (31) is solved in each iteration with updated W1 and W2. These two diagonal matrices are initially set to identity matrices and updated in the following manner:(32)w1i=1|ai|+ϵ1,i=1,…,N−2(33)w2j=1|bj|+ϵ2,j=1,…,N−3where(34)a=D2xˆ1(35)b=D3xˆ2Note that ϵ1 and ϵ2 are pre-defined fixed numbers. They are used to provide stability and to ensure that a zero-valued component inD2xˆ1orD3xˆ2in a certain iteration does not prohibit a nonzero estimate at the next iteration. According to Ref. [30], ϵ1 and ϵ2 should be set slightly smaller than the expected nonzero magnitudes of D2x1 and D3x2 respectively. In Fig. 8, the results of SDD and re-weighted SDD for one ECG beat are shown together where it is evident thatD2xˆ1andD3xˆ2are more sparse after the re-weighting process.Example 3.4A 2048 sample (sampling rate 360Hz) synthetic ECG test signal is generated using the algorithm given in [27], noisy observations of 0dB, 5dB and 10dB are generated by adding white Gaussian noise. For each case, experiments are performed 100 times for consistency and the empirical mean is computed. Results are again compared to EMD [5], LASIP [3] and symmlets wavelet (with vanishing moment 6). The analysis is detailed in Table. 1. While SDD has uniformly better performance than the other methods, after re-weighting, the SNR is further enhanced.This section addresses ECG QRS detection. We will demonstrate and evaluate SDD for this application.In the ECG QRS detection literature, true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN) refer to the number of true beat detection, false beat detection and true beats that are failed to be detected. The common criterions used to evaluated the overall performance include sensitivity (Se), positive prediction (+P), detection error rate and average time error that are defined as following:(36)Se(%)=TPTP+FN(37)+P(%)=TPTP+FP(38)DetectionErrorRate(%)=TP+FNTotalnumberofQRScomplex(39)AverageTimeError(ms)=Σ|detectedQRStime−actualQRStime|TPConventionally, the ECG recording is filtered by a band-pass filter with passband 8–20Hz to eliminate baseline wander and high-frequency noise. Though simple and efficient, the band-pass filtering is of limited use for two reasons. First, the low-pass filtering is not necessary for any first-derivative base detection algorithms (including the detector of this work) since the first-order difference for finite length signal is by itself a one pole low-pass filter. After taking the first-order difference, the baseline wonder will not affect the detection process with high probability. Second, in most cases, the artifact in real ECG signal not only exists in the frequency range higher than 20Hz but also the range below. As has been shown in Fig. 7(c), the signal after filtering still exhibits considerable amount of noise. Thus in the pre-process stage, the band-pass filtering is replaced by SDD.Since we prefer the detection system to be free of human intervention, the parameters λ1, λ2 and r in (13) must be specified before hand or calculated adaptively based on the data. This is achieved by a simple process as following. (a) There is usually not an analytical solution for how to choose λ1 and λ2 since they depend on the features or morphology of the signal. However, for this problem, λ1 and λ2 can be pre-decided by experiment and once specified, they are fixed and can be used for any ECG signal (λ1=λ2=1 for ECG signal). (b) The value of r can be specified adaptively by employing the observed fact that the power of the noise to be removed is approximately proportional to the energy of the highpassed subband signal with passband approximately 25Hz. That is,(40)r≈∥Hhpy∥2where y is the raw ECG signal and Hhpdenotes a high-pass filter with passband 25Hz. This confirms the prior knowledge that most of the artifacts in ECG is in the frequency band higher than 20Hz. Note that to increase the accuracy, the raw ECG data is divided into segments (4000 samples for each segment with sampling rate 360Hz for example) and the SDD is applied to each of the segments with the noise power of that segment independently estimated.The procedure is based on [31,32] with modification. First, the pre-processed ECGyˆis divided into segments: yi, i=1, …, M. For each yi, the Hilbert transform is applied to the first-order derivative of yi[31] to obtain the analytical signal ai, i=1, …, M. Next, the variable threshold thr(i) for each segment aiis calculated according to the root mean squared value RMS(i) of aior more specifically, according to (41) (in (41), max(i) denotes the maximal value of segment i). Note that the adaptive threshold described is slightly different from the one given in [31]. By introducing the small value c (in our example c = 1), the new detector prevents a very small amplitude fluctuation from being detected as a peak when a true peak is absent in the current segment and the RMS of the current segment is close to zero. Once the peak candidates are found by applying this first threshold, the location of the true peak can be determined according to the fact that the true peak has the largest magnitude within its 200ms time window. Next, we examine all the R peak to R peak (R–R) intervals that have been detected. Whenever there is a R–R interval exceeding 1.5 times the previous, a second threshold with the threshold value set to be 0.9 times the previous threshold is applied to this interval.(41)thr(i)=0.39max(i),RMS(i)>0.18max(i)&&max(i)≤2max(i−1)0.39max(i−1),RMS(i)>0.18max(i)&&max(i)≥max(i−1)1.6RMS(i),c≤RMS(i)≤0.18max(i)c,otherwiseIn [29], the authors point out some instances of failure indicating two types of difficulty for first-derivative based methods: low SNR and irregular morphology change. Next we demonstrate how SDD and the proposed detector combination increases the detection accuracy in the presence of these difficulties.Example 4.1The test signal in Fig. 9is from record 108 of MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. This signal brings two difficulties to QRS detection. First, low SNR with abrupt noise tends to increase the number of FP. Second, the QRS complexes with reversed polarity tend to increase the risk of FN. When it comes to the proposed method, the first difficulty is alleviated by SDD as shown in Fig. 9(a). Note that since the proposed method makes use of the analytic signal, which as shown in Fig. 9(c), is a positive waveform, the second difficulty is automatically solved. Fig. 9(b) verifies that baseline wonder does not affect the detection procedure.Example 4.2The test signal in Fig. 10is from record 208 and the test signal in Fig. 11is from record 228. They both have potential to increase FN due to wide premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and low-amplitude QRS complex respectively. The problems usually become more severe after frequency filtering because the QRS height is attenuated. Note that these two test signals are not ‘noisy’. Due to the relatively accurate estimate of the parameter r, SDD did not remove any ‘false artifact’ and all the QRS peaks are well preserved. As a result, all peaks are successfully detected as shown in Fig. 10(c) and Fig. 11(c).The proposed method (without re-weighting) is evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database for the first channel of all 48 records. Each signal is of length 30min and sampled at 360Hz. The first and last 10s are truncated to avoid the end effect of the Hilbert transform. Besides, episodes of ventricular flutter in record 207 (approximately 3min) are excluded from the analysis. The overall result of the proposed method and some other benchmark methods are listed in Table. 2. In the table, Methods 1–5 [29] are first-derivative methods with different details and detectors. Methods 6 [33], 7 [34] and 8 [35] are methods that used wavelet transform but different detection algorithms. Method 9 [36] described an algorithm which maps one dimensional ECG signals to two dimensional vectors, obtains a measure and finally locates QRS peaks based on the measure. Method 10 [32] invented a detection rule which used time-averaged signal to help better locate the true QRS peaks. Note that results of different methods cannot be compared directly because the total number of annotations of each experiment are not exactly equal and some methods did not provide information of average time error. However, from Table. 2, it can still be inferred that the proposed method performs fairly well because of the relatively high Se% and +P% (only lower than method 8 [35], which is tested on a significant smaller dataset compared to others). Note that usually if we increase the average time error which means we tolerate more time difference between the true peak and the peak detected, the error rate of detection goes down correspondingly, vice versa. For example, if we allow the average time error to be up to 50ms, the detection rate of error further goes down to 0.23%, on the other hand, if we restrict the average time error to be within 10ms, the detection rate of error increases to 0.25% or higher.
