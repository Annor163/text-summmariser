@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We developed a novel virtual reality therapy (VRT) program for online gaming addiction (OGA).We compared the treatment effect of VRT to cognitive behavior therapy for OGA.VRT reduced the severity of OGA, showing effects similar to cognitive behavior therapy.VRT improved the functional connectivity of the cortico-limbic circuit.

Background and objectiveNeuroimaging studies have demonstrated dysfunction in the brain reward circuit in individuals with online gaming addiction (OGA). We hypothesized that virtual reality therapy (VRT) for OGA would improve the functional connectivity (FC) of the cortico-striatal-limbic circuit by stimulating the limbic system.MethodsTwenty-four adults with OGA were randomly assigned to a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) group or VRT group. Before and after the four-week treatment period, the severity of OGA was evaluated with Young's Internet Addiction Scale (YIAS). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and FC from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seed to other brain areas were evaluated. Twelve casual game users were also recruited and underwent only baseline assessment.ResultsAfter treatment, both CBT and VRT groups showed reductions in YIAS scores. At baseline, the OGA group showed a smaller ALFF within the right middle frontal gyrus and reduced FC in the cortico-striatal-limbic circuit. In the VRT group, connectivity from the PCC seed to the left middle frontal and bilateral temporal lobe increased after VRT.ConclusionVRT seemed to reduce the severity of OGA, showing effects similar to CBT, and enhanced the balance of the cortico-striatal-limbic circuit.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Online gaming addiction (OGA) has considerable importance in public health, education, and related fields. Typically, OGA is defined as a pattern of excessive and prolonged online gaming that results in a cluster of cognitive and behavioral symptoms, including progressive loss of control over gaming, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms. Recently, Internet gaming disorder, which shares common concepts with online gaming addiction as explained above, was introduced in Section III of the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [1] as a condition needing further investigation. Similar to other addictive disorders, Internet gaming disorder requires further investigation of the prevalence, clinical course, and possible biological etiological factors based on neurobiological studies in order to determine its merit as an independent disorder [2].Neuroimaging studies of functional brain changes in response to video game playing have suggested that gaming cues activate brain reward systems in both healthy individuals (i.e., casual game users) and individuals with OGA. Gaming cues have been shown to stimulate the brain dopaminergic circuit in healthy individuals according to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies [3–5] and in a positron emission tomography study [6]. The involvement of the brain reward circuit in response to gaming has also been shown in individuals with OGA. Functional changes in the cortico-limbic circuit have been consistently reported in fMRI studies using gaming cues in participants with OGA [7–9]. Long-term continuous Internet game playing may also lead to structural brain changes [10,11]. Although the findings of functional neuroimaging studies indicate that similar brain regions related to the brain reward system are activated in response to gaming cues in both healthy volunteers and individuals with OGA, structural neuroimaging studies have demonstrated differences between these two groups. Weng et al. [10] reported that adolescents with OGA have reduced cortical thickness within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and show gray matter atrophy in the right OFC, bilateral insula, and right supplementary motor area compared to healthy participants. Yuan et al. [11] indicated that impaired gray and white matter integrity of the right OFC and bilateral insula is positively correlated with severity of OGA. These studies suggest dysfunction in the OFC and insula in people with OGA. This dysfunction of the OFC and insula is a neurobiological marker of addictive disorders and is related to impaired impulse control, cognitive flexibility, and reward-related decision making [12–14]. To summarize the literature on the neurobiology of Internet gaming, in response to Internet game playing, the cortico-striatal-limbic circuit seems to be activated in a balanced way in healthy individuals. However, long-term, continuous, and excessive Internet game playing in OGA may decrease activity in most areas of the brain except in the striatum, which indicates a neurobiological imbalance.In this context, pharmacological studies of OGA have been conducted targeting mood and impulsivity by regulating the synaptic availability of dopamine or serotonin in the cortico-striatal-limbic circuitry using methylphenidate [15], bupropion [16–18], and escitalopram [19]. As a non-pharmacological treatment for OGA, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been examined [17]. CBT is a simple, problem-oriented psychological treatment applied to many psychiatric problems, including addictive disorders [20]. Kim et al. [17] have reported that CBT in combination with bupropion is effective in reducing the severity of OGA in adolescents with major depression, especially in improving anxiety symptoms and life satisfaction as well as reducing time spent on Internet gaming. Du et al. [21] have reported that CBT for OGA in middle and high school students decreases Internet use and yields improvement in conductivity, mood problems, and other psychiatric symptoms. Young [18] has reported that CBT for adults with OGA is effective for controlling problematic Internet use, and its effects persist for six months.Virtual reality therapy (VRT) is a psychotherapy method that uses virtual reality technology. It has been shown to be effective for anxiety disorders, including specific phobias and posttraumatic stress disorder [22]. Additionally, VRT has been shown to be beneficial for managing some forms of addictive disorder, including nicotine and alcohol dependence [23–25]. In previous studies of VRT for alcohol dependence, VRT decreased craving for alcohol by regulating neurobiological imbalance in the limbic system [26]. VRT stimulated the limbic system (the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala) and reduced the craving response to alcohol stimuli [26]. A VRT program for alcohol dependence uses the technique of repeatedly pairing craving-inducing, alcohol-related stimuli with scenes of the aversive consequences of alcohol [26,27]. With this technique, a VRT program is expected to stimulate both the nucleus accumbens (associated with craving) and the amygdala (associated with aversion), facilitating limbic-regulated responses to rewarding stimuli [27]. A VRT program for alcohol has been shown to be more effective for reducing the craving for alcohol than is general cognitive behavioral therapy [25].Based on a review of the literature, we focused on a VRT program for addictive disorders that can help balance activation within the brain reward circuit by stimulating the limbic system. Accordingly, we developed a VRT program for the treatment of OGA that can stimulate the limbic system using mechanisms similar to VRT for alcohol dependence. We sought to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of VRT for OGA by balancing the limbic circuit via fMRI assessment before and after treatment. In addition, we sought to compare the treatment effects of VRT for OGA to CBT for OGA, because CBT is one of the most effective non-pharmacological treatment methods for OGA [28]. We hypothesized that VRT for OGA would decrease the severity of OGA with an effectiveness similar to that of CBT. We also hypothesized that VRT for OGA would improve the functional connectivity (FC) of the cortico-limbic circuit through repetitive stimulation of the limbic region.
