@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The human visual system (HSV) is quite adept at swiftly detecting objects of interest in complex visual scene. Simulating human visual system to detect visually salient regions of an image has been one of the active topics in computer vision. Inspired by random sampling based bagging ensemble learning method, an ensemble dictionary learning (EDL) framework for saliency detection is proposed in this paper. Instead of learning a universal dictionary requiring a large number of training samples to be collected from natural images, multiple over-complete dictionaries are independently learned with a small portion of randomly selected samples from the input image itself, resulting in more flexible multiple sparse representations for each of the image patches. To boost the distinctness of salient patch from background region, we present a reconstruction residual based method for dictionary atom reduction. Meanwhile, with the obtained multiple probabilistic saliency responses for each of the patches, the combination of them is finally carried out from the probabilistic perspective to achieve better predictive performance on saliency region. Experimental results on several open test datasets and some natural images demonstrate that the proposed EDL for saliency detection is much more competitive compared with some existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The human visual system (HSV) has a remarkable ability to quickly detect the salient regions in complex static or dynamic scenes and can easily understand scenes based on this selective functionality. In recent years, simulating human visual system to detect visually salient regions of an image has been arousing great research interests in computer vision. A wide range of potential applications of the saliency detection technology encompass image/video compression [1], image segmentation [2] and retrieval [3â€“5], video analysis [6], object recognition, detection and tracking [7,8], and so on.In light of the massive studies in the past years in neuropsychology, the deployment of visual attention has long been believed that there are two different approaches in visual processing mechanism: bottom-up approach and top-down approach.Bottom-up approach, which is also known as data-driven processing and task independent, means that the sensory information is analyzed in one direction: from simple analysis of raw sensory data to ever increasing complexity of analysis through the visual system. Lots of studies have attempted to explain on this area by observing the correlation between fixations of observers and basic features such as edge and local contrast [9,10]. The most classical saliency model was proposed by Itti et al. [11]. This model was based on the Feature Integration Theory (FIT) of Treisman and Gelade [12] and used a Difference of Gaussians (DoG) approach combining three kinds of low level features, i.e., intensity, color, and orientation, to determine center-surround contrast. Based on Itti's model, Harel et al. [13] proposed a graph-based visual saliency model to highlight conspicuous parts and permit combination with other maps. Ma and Zhang [14] proposed an approach that used color feature contrast analysis, and developed a fuzzy growing algorithm to extract conspicuous regions from the saliency map.On the contrary, top-down approach is related to the recognition process according to the prior knowledge such as tasks having been performed and the feature distribution of the object. The basic idea of this model is that various basic features are extracted from the scene and subsequently integrated into the representation of saliency map. Inspired by the theory of visual routines, Sprague and Ballard [15] proposed a top-down attention model based on RL (reinforcement learning) to make eye movements of an operator in virtual environments clear. Kanan et al. [16] proposed saliency detection method SUN using natural statistics to estimate the probability of a target at every location.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Inspired by ensemble learning, we developed an ensemble dictionary learning (EDL) framework for saliency detection. Within this framework, randomly selected samples are used to learn multiple self-contained over-complete dictionaries. By treating saliency detection as a problem of novelty detection, we proposed a reconstruction residual based model for atom reduction over the learned dictionary to further boost the distinctness of salient patch from the one of background. Finally the multiple independent dictionary-driven saliency response models were ensembled in a probabilistic way to obtain the saliency map. We experimentally evaluate our proposed model on several open test datasets and natural images, and also compare with some previous models. As indicated in the experimental results, the proposed EDL method preferably outperforms over some existing state-of-the-art algorithms.
