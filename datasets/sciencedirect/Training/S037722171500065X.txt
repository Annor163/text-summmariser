@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Many service providers, such as restaurants, are selling their gift cards through independent retailers. We analyze a supply chain of a service provider who sells products and gift cards at face value at its locations. The service provider also sells its gift cards through a retailer. Consumers may buy gift cards from the service provider or the retailer for their own use and/or to use as gifts. Consumers may be customers of both the service provider and retailer (Dual), only the service provide (SP-only), or only the retailer (retailer-only). We find that under a large enough gift cards’ redemption rate and no gift-givers, it is sub-optimal for a service provider to sell gift cards through a retailer. When there are some Retailer-only gift-givers, it is optimal for the service provider to sell gift cards through a retailer. We identify threshold redemption rates at which it is optimal for a service provider to sell gift cards through an independent retailer to different consumer segments. We also find that the SP may not always prefer a low redemption rate and for some service providers with large additional spending rates above redeemed gift cards’ value, profit may increase with the redemption rate. Also, centralization in the SP–retailer supply chain in this paper may lead to only a small increase in profits. Numerical analysis indicate that the redemption rate needed to make it optimal for the service provider to sell gift cards to all consumers through a retailer is unlikely to occur in practice.Service providers (SP) and retailers use various promotions to increase sales and profits; these include discounts, coupons, and rebates (Anderson and Song, 2004). Another strategy becoming popular is selling gift cards. Gift card sales grew to $91 billion in 2010 (Mui, 2010) and are expected to reach $138 billion in 2015 (CEB TowerGroup, 2012). SPs, and in particular restaurants, have been selling gift cards through their brick-and-mortar locations, websites, and, more recently, through independent retailers. The National Retail Federation reports that restaurant gift cards are one of the most popular items for gift-givers with 34.2 percent of shoppers surveyed indicating that they would buy at least one gift card of a restaurant (National Retail Federation, 2013). This makes restaurants second only to department stores in gift cards’ popularity. Many SPs’ gift cards are now offered at independent retailers. For example, gift cards of restaurant chains such as Applebees, Olive Garden, and Outback Steakhouse are offered by many major retail stores such as Sam’s Club and Costco. Some retailers sell the gift cards at a discount ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent of the face value of the cards. Fig. 1shows two restaurant chains’ gift cards offered by Costco at 20 percent discount, two offered by the BJ’s at 4 percent discount, and two offered by Sam’s Club at 1 percent discount. These gift cards are usually sold by the respective restaurant at face value.Selling gift cards through retailers has a few advantages for the SP. First, for consumers who would like to purchase gift cards to give to others, the SP can reach some gift-giving consumers who do not want to use the SP’s website and visiting the SP locations is inconvenient for them. Second, if gift cards are sold by the retailer at a discount, then the SP can practice first degree price discrimination among self-consumption consumers, i.e. charge different prices to different consumers within the same consumer segment at the same time (Murthi and Sarkar, 2003). Without selling gift cards through retailers, some SPs can practice second degree price discrimination, in which a firm uses nonlinear pricing or bundle pricing (Fang and Whinston, 2007). Also, many SPs practice third degree price discrimination where different prices are charged to different consumer segments (Holmes, 1989). For example, some restaurants give a senior citizens discount. With gift cards sold through an independent retailer, some consumers in the same segment can buy the cards at a discount from the retailer. When these consumers redeem the cards, they are effectively receiving a discount relative to consumers in the same segment buying goods and services with cash, and the SP practices first degree price discrimination.Another advantage of gift cards is that some consumers may redeem only part or none of the cards’ value (Thomas and Dillenbeck, 2004). Reasons for non-redemption include loss of cards and their expiration. We refer to this non-redemption as slippage. Estimates of slippage nine month after issuance is 19 percent (Horne, 2007). Efforts to eliminate expiration dates on gift cards were anticipated to improve redemption rates. However, recent research indicate that longer expiration dates decrease redemption rates (Shu and Gneezy, 2010). SPs also benefit from gift card redeemers spending more than the value of gift cards, which is estimated to be about 20 percent of card value (Thomas and Dillenbeck, 2004). One reason for this additional spending is that some consumers perceive the use of an entertainment gift card as having no impact on their typical entertainment spending (White, 2001).Selling gift cards through retailers also has disadvantages for the SP. Since consumer segments are not complectly sealed, leakage between them may occur (Gerstner and Holthausen, 1986). If gift cards are sold at a discount by the retailer, then some consumers may switch from the segment which would have paid the regular price to buying gift cards at the retailer and using them to pay at the SP. Also, the retailer must be compensated for selling gift cards.Our model falls in the intersection of two areas, advance selling and dual-channel supply chains. Advance selling can take place between a manufacturer selling goods and services to a retailer (Cho and Tang, 2013), or a retailer to consumers. For a review of advance selling the reader is referred to Tang (2006). Gift cards are a form of advance selling which may provide a powerful tool to improve profits (Shugan and Xie, 2000; 2005). Fay and Xie (2010) define “advance selling” as a marketing practice in which the seller offers consumers opportunities to make purchases before the time of consumption. Prasad, Stecke, and Zhao (2011) analyzed the problem of a retailer who can advance sell a product to consumers within the newsvendor model and found that under come conditions, advance selling will increase the retailer’s profit. Other models also find that advance selling increases retailers’ profits as well as consumer surplus (Tang, 2006). Selling retail gift cards creates another twist on advance selling in the sense that in addition to the temporal separation between purchase of the gift card and the purchase of goods/services using the cards, the actual selection of goods/services may be made by persons other than the gift-givers.Our model is also related to dual-channel supply chains literature since gift cards are sold through an independent retailer in addition to the SP, thus creating dual-channels. Many dual-channel models have concentrated on a manufacturer opening a direct online channel in addition to the retailer channel in decentralized and centralized settings (Dumrongsiri, Fan, Jain, and Moinzadeh, 2008; He, Song, and Zhang, 2013; Huang and Swaminathan, 2009). The same type of supply chain with the addition of warranty length as a determinant of consumer choice in cooperative and noncooperative settings was analyzed by Tsao and Su (2012). The literature indicates that the second channel is frequently used to pressure the retailer to charge a lower price which reduces double marginalization and improves supply chain profits (Chiang, Chhajed, and Hess, 2003). Furthermore, research in marketing shows that increasing the number of channels increases consumer demand and supply chain profits (Neslin et al., 2006).To the best of our knowledge, no research has addressed advance selling by a retailer to consumers in the context of an SP–retailer supply chain, particularly when this advance selling is transacted with gift cards. Previous models on the use of gift cards are few and are focused on the use of “free” gift cards. Khouja, Pan, Ratchford, and Zhou (2011) analyze the decision of a retailer giving consumers a “free” gift card if their purchase amount of all products in a single visit exceeds a threshold amount. Khouja, Park, and Zhou (2013a) analyze the retailer’s decision to use “free” gift cards to sell a product within the newsvendor model framework, or a particular manufacturer’s product in a single-retailer single-manufacturer supply chain (Khouja, Rajagopalan, and Zhou, 2013b).In this paper, we analyze a supply chain of an SP and a retailer selling goods and services which can be paid for in cash or gift cards. The SP can sell gift cards exclusively through its brick-and-mortar locations as well as its website, and may also sell gift cards through a retailer. We examine the following questions. (1) Under what conditions it is optimal for the SP to sell gift cards through an independent retailer? (2) What is the optimal discount from the SP to the retailer and from the retailer to consumers? (3) How does the performance of the decentralized supply chain compare to the performance of the benchmark centralized supply chain? (4) What is the impact of additional spending above the gift cards’ value on the SP?Our analysis contributes to the literature by considering this unique SP–retailer supply chain which differs from supply chains studied in the literature in some important aspects. First, the retailer in this dual-channel supply chain does not sell the SP’s products and services, but sells gift cards that can be used to buy these goods and services from the SP. Second, gift cards are sold rather than given “free” as a reward for purchases. Third, gift cards can be used by consumers to buy goods and services from the SP’s or be given as gifts. Therefore, many gift card buyers may not be interested in purchasing goods and services from the SP for themselves.In the next section we analyze the decentralized supply chain of an SP and a retailer without gift-giving consumers and identify the conditions under which it is optimal for the SP to sell gift cards through a retailer. We then analyze the problem with gift giving consumers. Next, we find the optimal centralized supply chain profits which serves as a benchmark. We then examine the effect of consumers’ spending more than the gift cards’ value. We perform numerical analysis before closing with managerial implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research.We begin by analyzing the problem without gift-givers. Consumers can buy goods and services from the SP with cash or can buy gift cards from the SP or the retailer and use them to pay for products at the SP. We assume that the SP is the leader in a Stackelberg game. The SP, knowing the optimal response of the retailer, determines the wholesale price, α, per $1 of gift card to the retailer and the retailer determines the price per $1 of gift card, pr, to the consumer.Without gift-givers, there is only the self-consumption consumer segment denoted by c as shown in Table 1. The potential expenditure of this segment is $C. We assume the reservation prices of consumers in this segment, V, are uniformly distributed on[0,V¯]as shown in Fig. 2. This results in the basic linear demand function commonly used in decision modeling (Huang, Leng, and Parlar, 2013). Consumers whose reservation prices are greater than or equal to the average price charged by the SP, Pd, purchase products from the SP. Consumers whose reservation prices are below Pddo not purchase products from the SP unless they can obtain gift cards for a price sufficiently below the cards’ face value to meet their reservation prices. Since c is the self-consumption segment, all of its consumers have access to the SP but not all of them have access to the retailer, which results in two subsegments. Consumers in the first subsegment of c, denoted by c1, do not have access to the retailer. c1 has a proportion of ρ1 of C and is referred to as the SP-only segment. Consumers in the second subsegment of c, denoted by c2, have access to the retailer. c2 has a proportion of ρ2 of C and is referred to as the Dual segment, where ρ1 + ρ2 = 1. For simplicity, we normalize Pdto pd= 1 and consumers’ reservation prices to[0,v¯],wherev¯=V¯/Pdas shown in Fig. 2. Let f(v) denote the probability density function of consumers’ reservation prices for goods and services, F(v) denote its cumulative probability density function, andF¯(v)=1−F(v).The SP sells gift cards directly to consumers at face value. Selling gift cards at a price above face value will be negatively received by consumers. If the SP sells gift cards for a price below face value then consumers will buy gift cards on the spot and use them instead of cash. The SP’s profit function isπd,NG=Cv¯−pdv¯(pd−s),where s is the cost of goods and services rate per $1 of sales. Lemma 1 describes the optimal pricing for goods and services of the SP.Lemma 1The optimal SP’s price level for products ispd*=s+v¯2and the maximum expected profit from sales of products isπd,NG*=C(v¯−s)24v¯.Lemma 1 is similar to the optimal pricing of a product with cost of c and a maximum consumer reservation price of b, which isb+c2. Since pdis a normalized price and the SP follows optimal pricing, we set the optimal price topd*=1. Solvingpd*=s+v¯2=1,we obtain the upper bound on consumer reservation prices ofv¯=2−sand an optimal expected SP’s profit of(1)πd,NG*=C(1−s)22−s.We assume that in offering gift cards, the SP does not change his price for goods and services from the optimal level in Lemma 1. The reason is that the sales of goods and services for cash is the largest part of the revenue, and thus optimal pricing of goods and services for cash is used by the SP. Given this optimal cash pricing, the SP optimizes his gift card pricing policy.The SP charges the retailer a wholesale price of α ≤ 1 per $1 of gift card. Consumers buying gift cards for self-consumption incur a holding cost of $h per $1, which is made up of two components, the cost of cash tied up in the card until redemption and the cost of uncertainty associated with redeeming the card. The consumer holding cost is similar to that incurred by consumers who stockpile when retailers offer discounts (Jeuland and Narasimhan, 1985; Su, 2010). SP-only consumers, i.e. in subsegment c1, incur a transaction cost to visit the retailer which is known to the SP and the retailer (Gerstner and Holthausen, 1986). We assume this transaction cost is T for all consumers in this subsegment. For simplicity, we assume that this cost for any consumer can be expressed as T = t × amount  of  card, where t is the transaction cost per 1$ of gift card. This assumption simplifies the analysis and is also reasonable since gift cards are sold in a single denomination in most cases.We assume that the cost of goods sold rate is larger than the sum of the consumers’ transaction and holding cost, h + t  <  s  <  1 and that the gross margin of the SP denoted by m = 1 − s is larger than consumers’ transaction cost 1 − s ≥ t (or s ≤ 1 − t). While many of our results hold for s ≤ h + t, and s  >  1 − t, these assumptions are quite realistic based on industry cost of goods sold rates (Butler Consultants, 2011; IBIS World, 2011).Let Dd, gdenote consumer demand for gift cards from the SP, Drdenote consumer demand for gift cards from the retailer, and prbe the price per $1 of gift card from the retailer. Both Dd, gand Drare in $. Since the SP sells each $1 of gift card for $1, consumers will not buy (for self-consumption) gift cards from the SP and Dd, g= 0. Thus, without gift-givers, demand for gift cards can only occur at the retailer if she offers the gift cards at a discount to face value. Three cases for Drcan be identified. If pr>  1 − h, then the discount at the retailer is insufficient to cover consumers’ holding cost and Dr= 0. If 1 − h − t  <  pr≤ 1 − h, then the discount at the retailer is sufficient to cover the Dual consumers’ holding cost but not the SP-only consumers’ holding and transaction costs and, thus,Dr=Cρ2v¯−(pr+h)v¯. If pr≤ 1 − h − t, then the discount at the retailer is sufficient to cover the holding and transaction costs of all consumers and thusDr=Cρ2v¯−(pr+h)v¯+Cρ1v¯−(pr+h+t)v¯. Therefore, the retailer’s gift card demand is(2)Dr={Dr1=0,if1−h<prDr2=Cρ2F¯(pr+h),if1−h−t<pr≤1−h.Dr3=Cρ2F¯(pr+h)+Cρ1F¯(pr+h+t),ifpr≤1−h−tFor a given α, the retailer’s expected profit is(3)πr={πr1=0,if1−h<prπr2=(pr−α)Cρ2F¯(pr+h),if1−h−t<pr≤1−h.πr3=(pr−α)[Cρ2F¯(pr+h)+Cρ1F¯(pr+h+t)],ifpr≤1−h−tIn the following analysis, αaand αb, PAand PB, and taand tbare threshold values of α, P, and t, respectively, which depend on problem parameters and are defined for convenience. Letta=ρ1+ρ1(1+3ρ2)2ρ1t,the retailer’s response to changes in the gift cards’ wholesale price depends on which of the following two conditions is realized: m ≥ taand t ≤ m  <  ta. Using reasonable gross margin parameter value from industry (Butler Consultants, 2011; IBIS World, 2011), the parameter combinations for the first condition is more likely to occur, whereas the second condition (i.e. t ≤ m  <  ta) may also occur in practice, but less likely. Define PB= 1 − h, which is the highest price the retailer can use to sell gift cards to the Dual segment consumers, PA= 1 − h − t which is the highest price the retailer can use to sell gift cards to all consumers, M1 = m + tρ2, and M2 = mρ1 + tρ2, we can prove Proposition 1.Proposition 11.Letαa=PAM1−PBmρ2M2,then for m ≥ ta, the retailer responds to a service provider’s wholesale price of α as follows(a)if α ≥ PB, the retailer cannot make any profit for any price;if αa<  α  <  PB, the retailer setspr*=PBand sells to only Dual consumers;if PA− m − ρ2t  <  α ≤ αa, the retailer setspr*=PAand sells to all consumers; andif 0  <  α ≤ PA− m − ρ2t, the retailer setspr*=m+PA+ρ2t+α2and sells to all consumers.Letαb=ρ2(m+PA−t)+2mρ1M1−2mρ2,then for t ≤ m  <  ta, the retailer responds to a service provider’s wholesale price of α as follows(a)if α ≥ PB, the retailer cannot make any profit for any price;if PB− m  <  α  <  PB, the retailer setspr*=PBand sells to only Dual consumers;if αb<  α ≤ PB− m, the retailer setspr*=m+PB+α2and sells to only Dual consumers;if PA− m − ρ2t  <  α ≤ αb, the retailer setspr*=PAand sells to all consumers; andif 0  <  α ≤ PA− m − ρ2t, the retailer setspr*=m+PA+ρ2t+α2and sells to all consumers.From Proposition 1, for some ranges of the wholesale price, α, it is optimal for the retailer to keep the retail price of gift cards fixed at PB= 1 − h or PA= 1 − h − t. For those ranges of α, the SP can increase the wholesale price of gift cards without any decrease in demand, which enables him to extract more profit. The existence and width of these ranges of the wholesale price depend on the relative sizes of the SP-only and the Dual consumer segments. We can show this more clearly for certain types of supply chains. Table 2classifies supply chains based on the strategy of the SP into three types: Low cost SPs have lowv¯−1(i.e. small margin m), differentiation SPs have mediumv¯−1(i.e. medium margin m), and focus SPs have highv¯−1(i.e. large margin m). Low-cost SPs target the largest number of consumers, e.g. restaurants such as McDonald. Differentiation SP target smaller number of consumers due to their higher prices, e.g. Olive Garden. Focus SPs target the smallest number of high-end consumers who are willing to pay high prices, e.g. McCormick and Schmick. As Table 2 describes, the retailer can also be large such as WalMart (4198 U.S. stores as of 2010), medium such as Target (1750 U.S. stores as of 2010), or small such as Costco (412 U.S. stores as of 2010) (Kantar Retail, 2012). For large retailers, we assume that all SP customers are customers of the retailer as well, i.e. ρ2 = 1. To gain insights from the model, as the retailer becomes medium size ρ2 is reduced by half to ρ2 = 0.5, which it is reduced by half for small size retailer to get ρ2 = 0.25.Table 2 also shows the expected consumer profile for each of the three types of SPs. Consumers of low-cost SPs are expected to be price sensitive, have large holding cost, and high gift cards redemption rate. The holding cost and redemption rate are expected to decrease as we move to the right in Table 2 toward consumers of focus SPs. Also, consumers may differ in their transaction cost. This is similar to the distinction made in terms of consumer search cost (Varian, 1980), where a segment of consumers have zero search cost and will buy from the lowest cost source, whereas the rest of consumers have an infinite search cost and will buy from the first firm they encounter. In other research, the search cost was assumed to be continuous (Arbatskaya, 2007). We use three levels for the transaction cost, low for consumers of low-cost SPs, medium for consumers of differentiation SPs, and high for consumers of focus SPs.More insightful results can be provided for supply chains of Table 2. For example, Corollary 1 shows how a large retailer responds to any SP strategy. We include Corollaries 6 and 7, which show a medium retailer’s and a small retailer’s response to an SP with m ≥ ta, respectively, in Appendix A. Fig. 3provides a graphical representation of the three corollaries. For the examples with ρ2 = 0.5 and ρ2 = 0.25 in Fig. 3, the condition of m ≥ tais satisfied.Corollary 1For a large retailer (ρ2 = 1) and all SP strategies,1.if α ≥ PB, the retailer cannot make any profit for any price;if PB− m  <  α  <  PB, the retailer setspr*=PBand sells to all consumers (who are the same as Dual consumers); andif α ≤ PB− m, the retailer setspr*=PB+m+α2≤PBand sells to all consumers (who are the same as Dual consumers).Corollary 1 applies to a large retailer (ρ2 = 1) and all SP strategies. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, a large retailer has the strongest response to changes in the gift cards’ wholesale price in the sense that the gift card retail price is higher for a large retailer than for medium and small retailers for most values of the gift cards’ wholesale price α. A large retailer raises the retail price to PB= 0.95 at wholesale price of α = 0.65, the medium retailer raises it to 0.95 at αa= 0.857, and the small retailer raises it to 0.95 at αa= 0.884. Thus, the retailer’s pricing power increases with its size as measured by the relative size of the Dual consumer segment (ρ2). Also, Fig. 3a shows that the retailer holds the price constant for different ranges of the wholesale price α. The SP knowing this response, i.e. the retailer using a fixed retail price of PAor PBfor a range of α, is able to select a wholesale price to extract more profit for himself.Fig. 3 b indicates, counter to expectations, that the pricing policy of the retailer is also influenced by pricing strategy of the SP represented by cost of goods sold rate, s. Focus SPs are represented by high margin m = 1 − 0.6 = 0.4, i.e. s = 0.6, and by Lemma 1, an upper limit on the reservation prices ofv¯=2−s=1−0.6=1.4. Differentiation SPs are represented by medium margin m = 1 − 0.7 = 0.3, i.e. s = 0.7, and an upper limit on reservation prices ofv¯=2−s=1−0.7=1.3. Low-cost SPs are represented by small margin m = 1 − 0.8 = 0.2, i.e. s = 0.8, and an upper limit on reservation prices ofv¯=2−s=1−0.8=1.2. The retailer thus responds by charging higher or the same retailer price for a focus SP than a differentiation SP for a given wholesale price, and by charging higher or the same retailer price for a differentiation SP than a low-cost SP.With gift cards sold through a retailer, the SP determines the wholesale price per $1 of gift card, α. The SP benefits from slippage because unredeemed card balances or a portion of it stays with the SP. Therefore, the net cost per $1 of gift card to the SP is λ × s, where the redemption rate, λ, satisfies 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 and λ = 1 indicates 100 percent redemption. Slippage may cause the SP to sell the gift cards to the retailer for $α per dollar that is smaller than the cost of goods sold rate, i.e. it is possible that an α  <  s is optimal for the SP.As discussed in Section 2.1, there are two patterns for the retailer’s response to changes in the wholesale price which results in two possible profit functions for the SP depending on which of the following cases is realized: m ≥ taand t ≤ m  <  ta. For m ≥ ta, usingv¯=2−s,PA= 1 − h − t, PB= 1 − h, the expected profit of the SP is(4)πd={π^d=C2−s2−s−h−α−ρ1t2(α−λs),ifα≤PA−m−ρ2tπ˜d=C2−s(1−s+ρ2t)(α−λs),ifPA−m−ρ2t<α≤αaπ¯d=Cρ12−s(1−s)2+Cρ22−s(1−s)(α−λs),ifαa<α<PBπˇd=C(1−s)22−s,ifα≥PB.For t ≤ m  <  ta, the expected profit of the SP is(5)πd={π^d=C2−s2−s−h−α−ρ1t2(α−λs),ifα≤PA−m−ρ2tπ˜d=C2−s(1−s+ρ2t)(α−λs),ifPA−m−ρ2t<α≤αbπ`d=Cρ12−s(1−s)2+Cρ22−s2−s−h−α2(α−λs),ifαb<α≤PB−mπ¯d=Cρ12−s(1−s)2+Cρ22−s(1−s)(α−λs),ifPB−m<α<PBπˇd=C(1−s)22−s,ifα≥PB.Note that for the case of a large retailer (i.e. ρ2 = 1), ta= ∞. Therefore, this case can be considered as a special case of t ≤ m  <  tawhere all consumers are Dual consumers and t is irrelevant. The expected profit of the SP when ρ2 = 1 is(6)πd={π`d=C2−s2−s−h−α2(α−λs),ifα≤PB−mπ¯d=C2−s(1−s)(α−λs),ifPB−m<α<PBπˇd=C(1−s)22−s,ifα≥PB.As discussed earlier, the case of m ≥ tais more likely to occur in practice. Fig. 4shows four possible shapes of πdin Equation (4). In Fig. 4a, it is suboptimal for the SP to use a retailer. Also, as the figure shows, the SP’s profit is linearly increasing between PA− m − ρ2t and αabecause the retailer keeps the retail price at pr= PAand the SP extracts all the profit from increasing the gift cards’ wholesale price. In Fig. 4b, it is optimal for the SP to charge a wholesale price of α = PB− ε, where ε  >  0 is a small profit amount per $1 of gift card the SP leaves for the retailer to make it worthwhile for her to sell gift cards. The retailer in turn charges a retail price of pr= PBand sells gift cards to Dual consumers. In Fig. 4c, it is optimal for the SP to charge a wholesale price of α = PA− ε, and to have the retailer charge a retail price of pr= PAand sell gift cards to all consumers. Fig. 4d shows the case in which the SP charges a wholesale price low enough, α  <  PA− m − ρ2t, to have the retailer charge a price smaller than PAand sell gift cards to all consumers. Also, as all four cases of Fig. 4 show, the SP’s profit is linearly increasing in α for αa<  α  <  PB, because the retailer holds the retail price at PB= 1 − h. Thus, for αa<  α  <  PBa wholesale price of α = PB− ε is optimal. Examples of this case may be the gift cards for Chili’s and Outback restaurants sold at 4 percent discount to face value by the BJ’s as shown in Fig. 1.The optimal solution for the decentralized supply chain without gift-givers is characterized in Proposition 2 and is illustrated in Fig. 5.Proposition 21.In a decentralized supply chain without gift-givers, if there are some SP-only consumers, i.e. ρ2  <  1, then(a)for λ  >  λ1, it is suboptimal for the SP to sell gift cards through a retailer;for λ2  <  λ ≤ λ1, the optimal retail price ispr*=PBand the wholesale price is α* = PB− ε;for λ3  <  λ ≤ λ2, the optimal retail price ispr*=PAand the wholesale price isα*=α˜; andfor λ ≤ λ3, the optimal retail price ispr*=3(m+PA+ρ2t)+λs4and the wholesale price isα*=m+PA+ρ2t+λs2≡α^,whereλ1=1−hs,when m ≥ ta,λ2=λ2a=αa(m+ρ2t)−ρ1m2−ρ2mPBs(ρ1m+ρ2t),λ3=λ3a=PA−3m−3ρ2t−8(m+ρ2t)(m−PA+ρ2t+αa)s,andα˜=αa; when t ≤ m  <  ta,λ2=λ2b=αb(m+ρ2t)−ρ1m2−ρ2mPBs(ρ1m+ρ2t),λ3 = λ3b=PA−3m−3ρ2t−8(m+ρ2t)(m−PA+ρ2t+αb)s,andα˜=αb.In a decentralized supply chain without gift-givers, if all consumers are Dual (ρ2 = 1), then(a)for λ  >  λ1, then it is suboptimal for the SP to sell gift cards through a retailer;for λ4  <  λ ≤ λ1, then the optimal retail price ispr*=PBand the wholesale price is α* = PB− ε; andfor λ ≤ λ4, then the optimal retail price ispr*=3(m+PB)+λs4and the wholesale price isα*=m+PB+λs2≡α`,whereλ4=3s−2−h−22(1−s)s.As can be seen in Fig. 5, any redemption rate λ  >  λ1 makes it suboptimal for the SP to sell gift cards through a retailer. Since λ1 is increasing in s, it is possible that for the same redemption rate it is optimal for an SP with large cost of goods sold rate to sell gift cards through a retailer compared to an SP with small cost of goods sold rate. This is because slippage will lead to higher increase in profit when the cost of goods sold rate is large. In Fig. 5a, for m ≥ ta(or s ≤ 1 − ta), if λ2a<  λ ≤ λ1, the retailer will sell the gift cards to only the Dual consumers for a price of PBand the SP will set the wholesale price at a price slightly below the retail price of PBto make it worthwhile for the retailer to sell the gift card. For a lower, and less likely to occur, redemption rate satisfying λ3a<  λ ≤ λ2a, it is optimal to have the retailer sell the gift cards to all consumers for a price of PAand the SP sets the wholesale price of αa. For redemption rates lower than λ3a, which is unlikely to occur, the optimal retail price will be below PA. At s = 1 − ta, αa= αband similar results are obtained for t ≤ m  <  ta(or 1 − ta<  s ≤ 1 − t). In the case of a large retailer (ρ2 = 1) shown in Fig. 5b, for a redemption rate satisfying λ4  <  λ ≤ λ1 it is optimal to have the retailer sell gift cards to all consumers for a price of PBand the SP sets the wholesale price at α* = PB− ε to extract the maximum profit. For redemption rates lower than λ4, the optimal retail price will be below PB. Comparing Lemma 1 and Proposition 2, Corollary 2 follows.Corollary 2For m ≥ ta, comparing the retailer case to the no-retailer case,(a)if redemption rate λ  >  λ1, the SP’s optimal expected profit does not change;if λ2a<  λ ≤ λ1, the SP’s optimal expected profit can increase byΔ1=100[ρ2s(λ1−λ)m]percent≥0;if λ3a<  λ ≤ λ2a, the SP’s optimal expected profit can increase byΔ2=100[sM1m2(λ2a−λ)+ρ2tmM22(M1M2+ρ22m2)]percent>0; andif λ ≤ λ3a, the SP’s optimal expected profit can increase byΔ3=100[18m2{s2(λ3a−λ)2+2s(λ3a−λ)[4(m+ρ2t)+Γa]+[4(m+ρ2t)+Γa]2−8m2}]percent>0,whereΓa=8(m+ρ2t)(m−PA+ρ2t+αa).The results for the case of t ≤ m  <  taare similar to those in Corollary 2, with λ2areplaced with λ2b, λ3areplaced with λ3b, αareplaced with αb, Γareplaced with Γb, andΔ2=100[sM1m2(λ2b−λ)+1mM2(M1ρ2(PB−αb)−ρ22tm)]percent>0.Corollary 2 is illustrated in Fig. 6, which shows that the profit advantage from gift card decreases (increases) with the redemption rate (slippage rate). The rate of the decrease is steeper for λ  <  λ2a, where the retailer sells gift cards to all consumers and, therefore, the benefit from slippage is large. The rate of the decrease becomes smaller for λ  >  λ2asince the benefit from slippage is obtained only from consumers in the Dual segment. Also, the curve corresponding to s = 0.8 (m = 0.2) is above the curve for s = 0.7 (m = 0.3) because slippage results in larger savings when the cost of goods sold rate is larger. For λ2a<  λ  <  λ1, the retailer sells gift cards to Dual consumers at a price of 1 − h. SincedΔ1dρ2>0,the SP’s profit increase is higher when the Dual segment is large because the benefit of slippage is obtained from a larger group of consumers. SincedΔ1dh<0,the SP’s increase in profit is higher when consumers’ holding cost is small because the Dual segment will buy gift cards at higher price of 1 − h and, therefore, it is less costly to obtain the benefit from slippage.To provide further insights, we focus the analysis on the supply chain configurations of Table 2. We also assume that for consumers of low-cost SPs, h = 4t, for consumers of differentiation SPs, h = t, and for consumers of focus SPs,h=t4. Table 3shows the critical values of the redemption rates of Proposition 2. Redemption rates needed to let a retailer of any size sell gift cards to Dual consumers for differentiation and focus SPs are reasonable (λ  <  0.857 and λ  <  0.92, respectively, for medium or small retailer). When one considers that about 19 percent of gift cards are unredeemed nine month after issuance (Horne, 2007), the redemption rates needed to have focus SPs sell gift cards to the Dual consumers seem quite reasonable. For low-cost SPs, the redemption rate must be below 0.812 to make it optimal for the SP to sell gift cards through a retailer, which, considering the price-sensitive nature of customers of low-cost SPs and the high accessibility of these SPs (e.g. MacDonald), is unlikely. The maximum redemption rates of gift cards for which the SP will sell gift cards to all consumers are very small (a maximum of 0.746 for low-cost SPs and small retailer) and is unlikely to be encountered in practice.The above analysis indicates that without gift-givers, realistic redemption rates make it optimal to sell gift cards to Dual consumers through a retailer. Selling gift cards to all consumers through a retailer requires high slippage rates unlikely to exist in industry.Let segment g denote the set of consumers who buy gift cards as gifts. The potential expenditure of this segment is $G. Segment g has three subsegments as shown in Table 1. Consumers in the first subsegment, denoted by g1, have access only to the SP and this SP-only subsegment has a proportion of γ1 of G. Consumers in the second subsegment, denoted by g2, have access to the retailer and the SP and this Dual subsegment has a proportion of γ2 of G. Consumers in the third subsegment, denoted by g3, have access to only the retailer and this Retailer-only subsegment has a proportion of γ3 of G with γ1 + γ2 + γ3 = 1. This Retailer-only subsegment has no equivalent in the consumption consumer segment. We assume the reservation prices of consumers in g per $1 of gift card, v, are uniformly distributed on[0,v¯],which is the same as the consumption segment. We also assume that consumers in the SP-only subsegment in g (i.e. g1) face a transaction cost of $t per $1 to visit the retailer, which is the same cost incurred by the SP-only consumers in the consumption segment c, i.e. c1, and consumers in the Retailer-only subsegment in g (i.e. g3) face a transaction cost of $k per $1 to visit the SP. We assume that k is large enough so that the Retailer-only subsegment will not buy gift cards if the SP does not sell the gift cards through the retailer. In addition, since consumers in g buy gift cards as gifts, they do not have a holding cost. We also assume that the relative size of the SP-only subsegment to the Dual subsegment in the consumption and gift-givers segments is the same, i.e.ρ1ρ2=γ1γ2. Since the gift-giver segment also has a Retailer-only subsegment of proportion γ3, this assumption implies that γ1 = ρ1(1 − γ3) and γ2 = ρ2(1 − γ3).Some gift-givers may also consume goods and services at the SP, i.e. some consumers may belong to both segments c and g, i.e. c∩g as shown in Fig. 7. A subset of consumers in c∩g, demoted by A, have access only to the SP and buy both gift cards to give to others as well as goods for themselves from the SP. A subset of consumers in c∩g, demoted by B, have access to both the SP and retailer and also buy both gift cards to give to others as well as goods for themselves from the SP. Although consumers in A and B belong to both segments c and g, they usually have separate budgets for self-consumption and gift-giving. Therefore, when it comes to the monetary measure, all subsegments are exclusive. The model with gift-givers is shown in Fig. 8, which shows consumers’ utility from buying gift cards and goods and services.The expected profit of the retailer depends on the relative values of h and t. We show the retailer’s and SP’s expected profit functions for t ≥ h. The profit functions for t  <  h are shown in Appendix A. Fig. 9shows the consumer subsegments which the retailer and the SP sell to give the retail price prwhen t ≥ h. Let PC= 1 − t, the expected profit of the retailer is(7)πr={πr0=0,ifpr>1πr1=(pr−α)G(γ2+γ3)F¯(pr),ifPB<pr≤1πr2=(pr−α)[G(γ2+γ3)F¯(pr)+Cρ2F¯(pr+h)],ifPC<pr≤PBπr3=(pr−α)[GF¯(pr+γ1t)+Cρ2F¯(pr+h)],ifPA<pr≤PCπr4=(pr−α)[GF¯(pr+γ1t)+Cρ2F¯(pr+h)+Cρ1F¯(pr+h+t)],ifPA≥pr.For the uniform distribution on[0,v¯],πrbecomes(8)πr={πr0=0,ifpr>1πr1=1v¯(pr−α)G(γ2+γ3)(v¯−pr),ifPB<pr≤1πr2=1v¯(pr−α)[G(γ2+γ3)(v¯−pr)+Cρ2(v¯−pr−h)],ifPC<pr≤PBπr3=1v¯(pr−α)[(G+Cρ2)(v¯−pr)−Cρ2h−Gγ1t],ifPA<pr≤PCπr4=1v¯(pr−α)[(G+C)(v¯−pr)−Ch−Gγ1t−Cρ1t],ifPA≥pr.The SP’s expected profit is(9)πd={πd0=v¯−1v¯[(1−s)C+(1−λs)G(1−γ3)],ifpr>1πd1=v¯−1v¯[(1−s)C+(1−λs)Gγ1]+Gv¯(α−λs)(γ3+γ2)(v¯−pr),ifPB<pr≤1πd2=v¯−1v¯[(1−s)Cρ1+(1−λs)Gγ1)]+1v¯(α−λs)[G(γ2+γ3)(v¯−pr)+Cρ2(v¯−pr−h)],ifPC<pr≤PBπd3=v¯−1v¯(1−s)Cρ1+1v¯(α−λs)×[(G+Cρ2)(v¯−pr)−Cρ2h−Gγ1t]],ifPA<pr≤PCπd4=1v¯(α−λs)[(G+C)(v¯−pr)−Ch−Gγ1t−Cρ1t],ifPA≥pr.Lemma 2If there are some Retailer-only gift card givers (i.e. γ3  >  0), then it is optimal for the SP to gift cards through the retailer.If the SP sets the wholesale price at α = 1 − ε, where ε  >  0 is very small, then it is optimal for the retailer to charge a price of pr= 1. Comparing πd0 and πd1 in (9), we can easily conclude that the SP will be better off by selling gift cards through the retailer as long as γ3  >  0. In other words, the SP can make money by letting the retailer keep a small profit of $ε per $1 to make it worthwhile for her to sell gift cards to Retailer-only gift card giving consumers. In general, the retailer’s optimal response to the SP’s wholesale price depends on the values of various parameters and is very complex if we consider all possible values of these parameters. To obtain some insights, we make the following reasonable simplifying assumptions.1.The size of the gift-giver segment isG=Cx,where 7 ≤ x ≤ 9 which implies that gift cards account for about 10 percent to 12.5 percent of total market size. This assumption is close to typical industry estimates. For example, for Starbucks Coffee Company, this percentage is about 12 percent (x = 7.33) (Chakravorti and Lubasi, 2006).For differentiation and focus SPs, their margin satisfies m = 1 − s ≥ h + t. Given the consumer profiles of these consumers in Table 2, these values are realistic.The proportion of Retailer-only gift-givers is less than or equal to 30 percent, γ3 ≤ 0.3.Propositions 3 –5 identify the optimal retailer pricing and served segments in SP-large retailer, differentiation SP-medium retailer, and focus SP-small retailer supply chains, respectively. Parameter combinations and gift card wholesale price under which the retailer sells to different consumer segments are identified. We then compare the results with their counter parts in Section 2 to see how the existence of gift-givers changes the retailer’s response.Proposition 3In a supply chain with any SP and a large retailer with ρ2 = 11.Form≥x+x2+4x2xh(a)IfαA1=h(s−mx)+mx−h2h+mx≤α<1then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers (i.e. Retailer-only and Dual gift-givers) forpr*=1.IfαA2=s−h(x+2)x+1≤α<αA1then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and consumption consumers forpr*=PB=1−h.If α  <  αA2then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and consumption consumers forpr*=(1+x)(α+2−s)−xh2(1+x).Form<x+x2+4x2xh(a)If s ≤ α  <  1 then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers forpr*=1.IfαA3=s−2h−2mx+2m2x(1+x)+mxh≤α<sthen it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers forpr*=2−s+α2.If αA2 ≤ α  <  αA3then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and consumption consumers forpr*=PB=1−h.If α  <  αA2then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and consumption consumers forpr*=(1+x)(α+2−s)−xh2(1+x).Comparing Proposition 3 and Corollary 1 shows that with gift-givers, the retailer can possibly sell gift cards at face value. Also, threshold values of the wholesale price at which the retailer sells to more consumer segments changes. Comparing threshold values shows that for reasonable problem parameters and for a given wholesale price, the addition of gift-givers makes it more likely for the retailer to charge a higher retail price and serve fewer consumer segments.Proposition 4In a supply chain with a differentiation SP and medium retailer withρ1=ρ2=12and h = t(a)IfαD1≡1−h−m(1+γ3)m(1+x−γ3)+h(1+γ3)h≤α<1then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to Retailer-only and Dual gift-givers forpr*=1.IfαD2≡1−2h−m(2+x)+h(1+γ3)mx+h(2+x)h≤α<αD1then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and the Dual consumption subsegment consumers forpr*=PB=1−h.IfαD3≡s−2h−3+x+γ32(1+x)h≤α<αD2then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and consumption consumers forpr*=PA=1−h−t=1−2h.If α  <  αD3then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and consumption consumers forpr*=(1+x)(2−s+α)−(γ1+x(1+ρ1))h2(1+x).To examine the effect of the presence of gift-givers on a medium retailer’s pricing policy, we compare Proposition 4 with Corollary 6 (see Appendix A) which results in Corollary 3.Corollary 3For a differentiation SP and medium a retailer withρ1=ρ2=12,h = t, m ≥ ta comparing the gift-givers case to the no gift-givers case.1.For the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and consumption consumers, the maximum wholesale price charged by the SP is lower than the no gift-givers case byh(h2+hγ3(h+m)+hm+2m2)(h+m)(h(x+2)+mx).For the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and Dual consumption consumers, the maximum wholesale price charged by the SP is lower than the no gift-givers case byhm(1+γ3)h(γ3+1)+m(1+x−γ3).Corollary 3 indicates that the maximum wholesale price the SP can charge to make the retailer sell gift cards to all gift-givers and consumption consumers is lower than in the case of no gift-givers. The needed decrease in the wholesale price is increasing in the size of the gift giver segment (i.e. decreasing in x) and in the proportion of the Retailer-only subsegment γ3 within the gift-givers segment. The reason is that for a given gift card wholesale price, lowering the retail price from Pr= 1 − t = 1 − h, where all gift-givers and Dual consumption consumers are buying gift cards from the retailer, to Pr= 1 − h − t requires giving this discount to those consumers in order to gain the SP-only consumption consumers. This makes it less profitable for the retailer to sell gift cards to all consumers for a given wholesale price when there are a large number of gift-givers. Similarly, the maximum wholesale price the SP can charge to make the retailer sell gift cards to all gift-givers and Dual consumption consumers is lower than in the case of no gift-givers.Proposition 5For a focus SP and small retailer withρ1=34,ρ2=14and t = 4h1.IfαS1≡1−h−m(1+3γ3)mx+h(1+3γ3)h≤α<1then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to Retailer-only and Dual gift-givers forpr*=1.IfαS2≡1−6h−m(1+x+15γ3)−h(3+4x−3γ3)3m(1+x−γ3)+h(7+4x+9γ3)h≤α<αS1then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and Dual consumption consumers forpr*=1−h;IfαS3≡s−6h−(1+3γ3)1+xh≤α<αS2then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift giver and consumption consumers forpr*=1−h−t=1−5h; andIf α  <  αS3then it is optimal for the retailer to sell gift cards to all gift-givers and consumption consumers forpr*=(1+x)(2−s+α)−h(3+4x−3γ3)2(1+x).Comparing Proposition 5 with Corollary 7 (see Appendix A) shows that, similar to Corollary 3, the maximum wholesale price the SP can charge to make the retailer sell gift cards to the same consumer segments is lower than in the case of no gift-givers.From the proceeding analysis, the existence of Retailer-only gift-givers makes it optimal to sell gift cards to at least Retailer-only gift-givers and likely to Dual gift-givers. However, it becomes less likely optimal to sell gift cards to all consumers. Next, we identify the maximum potential benefits from selling gift cards through a retailer without gift-givers, which occur when a central controller coordinates the supply chain.Suppose a central controller maximizes the expected profit of the supply chain and sells each $1 of gift card for $β at the retailer and for $1 at the SP locations. If there is no gift-giver consumer segment, the expected profit of the centralized supply chain is(10)πI={πˇI=C2−s(1−s)2,ifβ>PBπ`I=C2−s[ρ2(2−s−h−β)×(β−λs)+ρ1(1−s)2],ifPA<β≤PBπ^I=C2−s(β−λs)×(2−s−h−tρ1−β),ifβ≤PA.For the case of a larger retailer and all consumers are Dual consumers, i.e. ρ2 = 1, the expected profit of the centralized supply chain is(11)πI={πˇI=C2−s(1−s)2,ifβ>PBπ`I=C2−s(2−s−h−β)(β−λs),ifβ≤PB.Proposition 6, illustrated in Fig. 10, identifies the centralized supply chain optimum.Proposition 61.In a centralized supply chain without gift-givers, if there are some SP-only consumers, i.e. ρ2  <  1, then(a)for λ  >  λ1, it is suboptimal to sell gift cards through a retailer;for λ5  <  λ ≤ λ1, the optimal retail price isβ*=m+PB+λs2≡β`;for λ6  <  λ ≤ λ5, the optimal retail price is β* = PA; andfor λ ≤ λ6, the optimal retail price isβ*=m+PA+ρ2t+λs2≡β^,whereλ1=1−hs,λ5=ρ2(m+PA−t)−2m+2mρ1M2sρ2,andλ6=s−h−t−ρ2ts.In a centralized supply chain without gift-givers, if all consumers are Dual consumers, i.e. ρ2 = 1, then(a)for λ  >  λ1, it is suboptimal to sell gift cards through a retailer;for λ ≤ λ1, the optimal retail price isβ*=m+PB+λs2=β`.As Fig. 10 shows, any redemption rate λ  >  λ1 makes it suboptimal to sell gift cards through a retailer, which is the same for the decentralized supply chain. For a lower redemption rate satisfying λ5  <  λ ≤ λ1, it becomes optimal to sell gift cards to Dual consumers forβ*=12(m+PB+λs)per $1 of gift card, i.e. the retailer’s gift card price is the optimal on the β ∈ (PA, PB] range of theπ`Isegment. This is different from the decentralized supply chain solution where the solution is at PBto allow the SP to extract the maximum profit. For a redemption rate satisfying λ6  <  λ ≤ λ5, it is optimal to hold the retail price per $1 of gift card constant at β* = PA, which is at the extreme point on the β ∈ [0, PA] range ofπ^I. For a redemption rate λ ≤ λ6, it is optimal to sell gift cards to all consumers through the retailer at a price ofβ*=12(m+PA+ρ2t+λs)per $1 of gift card, i.e. the retailer’s gift card price is the optimal on the β ∈ [0, PA] range of theπ^Isegment. If all consumers are Dual consumers, then the supply chain either does not sell gift cards through the retailer when the redemption rate is high, i.e. λ  >  λ1, or sell through the retailer usingβ*=12(m+PB+λs)when the redemption rate is lower than λ1.From Propositions 2 and 6, Corollary 4 provides the maximum redemption rate under which it is optimal to sell gift cards to Dual consumers through the retailer and applies to both decentralized and centralized supply chains.Corollary 4Ifλ≤1−hs,then it is optimal for the SP to have the retailer sell gift cards to at least the Dual consumer segment.Since1−hs≤1and λ ≤ 1, Corollary 4 indicates that if all gift cards are redeemed (λ = 1) and gift cards do not result in incremental sales above the cards’ value, then it is suboptimal for the SP to sell gift cards through a retailer. Thus, the reason for the SP to offer gift cards through a retailer, in a centralized or decentralized supply chain, may be the presence of gift-givers, less than 100 percent redemption and/or additional spending above the cards’ values.Corollary 4 is illustrated in Fig. 11which shows the maximum gift card redemption rate for which it is optimal for the SP to sell gift cards to at least the Dual consumers through the retailer vs. consumers’ holding cost of gift cards (h) for s = 0.60 and 0.80 (m = 0.4 and 0.2, respectively). If all consumers have the same holding cost, then Fig. 11 is counter to industry-practice. The figure shows that differentiation/focus SPs (i.e. SPs with large m) should be less likely to sell gift cards through retailers because they require lower redemption rate to make it optimal to sell gift cards through a retailer. However, as shown in Fig. 1, examples in industry of gift cards sold through retailers have higher margin SPs. This may be explained by different characteristics of consumers of different types of SPs. If the price-sensitive consumers of low-cost SPs have a high holding cost and high redemption rate as shown by the right hand circle of Fig. 11, whereas the less price-sensitive consumers of differentiation and focus SPs have a lower holding cost and lower redemption rate as shown by the circle on the left, then we would expect that it is more likely for differentiation and focus SPs to offer their gift cards through retailers. This is more reflective of the examples of the SPs shown in Fig. 1. Corollary 5 compares the performance of the decentralized and centralized supply chains.Corollary 5Comparing the decentralized supply chain to the centralized supply chain,1.if λ5  <  λ ≤ λ1then Dual consumers pay $12(s−h−λs)more per $1 of gift card in the decentralized supply chain, for which the optimal expected profit is smaller than the centralized chain’s profit byδ1=Cρ2(s−h−λs)24(m+1);if λ6  <  λ ≤ λ5then Dual consumers pay $t more per $1 of gift card in the decentralized supply chain, for which the optimal expected profit is smaller than the centralized chain’s profit byδ2=CM2(s−h−t−λs)m+1;if λ2  <  λ ≤ λ6then Dual consumers pay $12(s−h−λs+ρ1t)more per $1 of gift card in the decentralized supply chain, for which the optimal expected profit is smaller than the centralized chain’s profit byδ3=C[(s−h−ρ1t−λs)2+4mρ1(s−h−t−λs)]4(m+1);if λ3  <  λ ≤ λ2then all consumers pay $12(s−h−λs−t−ρ2t)more per $1 of gift card in the decentralized supply chain, for which the optimal expected profit is smaller than the centralized chain’s profit byδ4=C(s−h−t−ρ2t−λs)24(m+1);if λ ≤ λ3then all consumers pay $14(2−s−h−ρ1t−λs)more per $1 of gift card in the decentralized supply chain, for which the optimal expected profit is smaller than the centralized chain’s profit byδ5=C(2−s−h−ρ1t−λs)216(m+1),when m ≥ ta, λ2 = λ2aand λ3 = λ3a; and when t ≤ m  <  ta, λ2 = λ2band λ3 = λ3b.Corollary 5 shows that for the SP–retailer supply chain, centralization does not result in as large of a decrease in retail prices and an increase in profits as in a typical manufacturer–retailer supply chain, where decentralization will lead to a100v¯−s2(v¯+s)percent=1001−s2percentincrease in price and centralization will lead to 33 percent increase in profit. This is illustrated in Fig. 12. As Fig. 12a shows, for a realistic range of the redemption rate λ  >  λ5 = 0.818, the increase in retail price due to decentralization is less than 4.15 percent (compared to1001−s2percent=1001−0.82percent=10percentin a typical manufacturer–retailer supply chain) and the increase in supply chain profit due to centralization is less than 1.45 percent. The decreased benefit of centralization in this SP–retailer supply chain is because it is optimal for the independent retailer to hold price constant at PBor PAfor two ranges of the wholesale price, which causes the SP to make the wholesale prices as large as possible in those ranges of the wholesale prices to extract the maximum profit, and, thus, reduce the effect of double marginalization. For the centralized supply chain, the retail price is increasing in λ for λ  <  λ6 = 0.781 on the range β ∈ (0, PA). The retail price is then held constant at PAfor 0.781  <  λ  <  λ5 = 0.818, then the retail price is increasing in λ for 0.818  <  λ  <  λ1 = 0.9125 on the range β ∈ [PA, PB].For the decentralized supply chain, λ3a= −0.54 and thus it is suboptimal for the SP to use a wholesale price for which the retailer will set a retail price below PAfor any redemption rate. For λ ≤ λ2a= 0.712, from Proposition 2, it is optimal for the SP to set the wholesale price at the maximum (i.e. αa= 0.808) where it is still optimal for the retailer to keep the gift card retail price atpr*=PA=0.86. For λ2a<  λ ≤ λ1 = 0.9125, it becomes optimal for the SP to set the wholesale price at the maximum of PB− ε, ε  >  0 to make it worthwhile for the retailer to sell the gift card at price ofpr*=PB=0.93. The resulting price differences between the decentralized and centralized supply chain in Fig. 12a shows that when λ is just below λ2aor λ1, where the SP extracts the maximum profit for himself, the increase in the retail price due to decentralization is either 3.30 percent or 0 percent, respectively.Fig. 12 b shows that for redemption rates where the retailer charges much higher price per $1 of gift card than the centralized supply chain, i.e. λ ∈ (λ2a, λ5), the optimal expected profit of the centralized supply chain is considerably larger than the decentralized chain’s profit. When λ is just below λ2aor λ1 where the SP extracts the maximum profit for himself, the increase in profit due to centralization is 1.12 percent or 0 percent, respectively. For realistic values of the redemption rate on the range [0.8, 1], the largest increase in profit due to centralization is 5.51 percent, which is small compared to the 33 percent of the typical manufacturer–retailer supply chain.Corollary 2 showed that without gift-givers, a significant increase in the SP’s profit may be obtained from selling gift cards through an independent retailer in a decentralized supply chain. Corollary 5 showed that centralization may lead to only a minor improvement in the performance of this supply chain. We investigate the effect of gift-givers numerically in Section 6. In the next section, we examine the effect of gift card redeemers’ spending above the gift cards’ value on the SP’s profit in a decentralized supply chain.Consumers redeeming gift cards may spend more than the value of the gift cards. In a survey by Accenture (2005), 45 percent of respondents stated that when redeeming gift cards, they spend more than the value of the card. Suppose that a gift card redeemer buys on average a total of $(1 + η) worth of products per $1 of redeemed card, $η is paid in cash and the remaining $1 is paid with the gift card. For m ≥ ta, the expected profit of the SP is(12)πη={π^η=C2−s(2−s−h−α−ρ1t)2×[α−λ(s−(1−s)η)],ifα≤PA−m−ρ2tπ˜η=C2−s(1−s+ρ2t)×[α−λ(s−(1−s)η)],ifPA−m−ρ2t<α≤αaπ¯η=Cρ12−s(1−s)2+Cρ22−s(1−s)×[α−λ(s−(1−s)η)],ifαa<α<PBπˇη=C(1−s)22−s,ifα≥PB.For the case of a large retailer (i.e. ρ2 = 1), the expected profit of the SP is(13)πη={π`η=C2−s2−s−h−α2×[α−λ(s−(1−s)η)],ifα≤PB−mπ¯η=C2−s(1−s)×[α−λ(s−(1−s)η)],ifPB−m<α<PBπˇη=C(1−s)22−s,ifα≥PB.We can prove Proposition 7.Proposition 7In a decentralized supply chain without gift-givers, and with additional consumer spending of $η per $1 of redeemed gift cardI.For η ≤ s/(1 − s)(I.1)If there are some SP-only consumers, i.e. ρ2  <  1, and m ≥ ta, then(a)forλ>ss−(1−s)ηλ1,it is suboptimal to sell gift cards through an independent retailer;forss−(1−s)ηλ2a<λ≤ss−(1−s)ηλ1,it is optimal to have the retailer sell gift cards to Dual consumers at pricepr*=PBand the SP to charge a wholesale price α* = PB− ε;forss−(1−s)ηλ3a<λ≤ss−(1−s)ηλ2a,it is optimal to have the retailer sell gift cards to all consumers at pricepr*=PAand the SP to charge a wholesale price α* = αa; andforλ≤ss−(1−s)ηλ3a,it is optimal to have the retailer sell gift cards to all consumers at pricepr*=3(m+PA+ρ2t)+λ(s−(1−s)η)4and the wholesale price isα*=m+PA+ρ2t+λ(s−(1−s)η)2≡α^η.If all consumers are Dual consumers, i.e. ρ2 = 1, then(a)forλ>ss−(1−s)ηλ1,it is suboptimal for the SP to sell gift cards through a retailer;forss−(1−s)ηλ4<λ≤ss−(1−s)ηλ1,the optimal retail price ispr*=PBand the wholesale price is α* = PB− ε; andforλ≤ss−(1−s)ηλ4,the optimal retail price ispr*=3(m+PB)+λ(s−(1−s)η)4and the wholesale price isα*=m+PB+λ(s−(1−s)η)2≡α`η.For η  >  s/(1 − s)(II.1)If there are some SP-only consumers, i.e. ρ2  <  1, and m ≥ ta, then(a)forλ≥ss−(1−s)ηλ2a,it is optimal to have the retailer sell gift cards to all consumers at pricepr*=PAand the SP to charge a wholesale price α* = αa; andforλ<ss−(1−s)ηλ2a,it is optimal to have the retailer sell gift cards to Dual consumers at pricepr*=PBand the SP to charge a wholesale price α* = PB− ε.If all consumers are Dual consumers, i.e. ρ2 = 1, then(a)forλ≥ss−(1−s)ηλ4,then the optimal retail price ispr*=3(m+PB)+λ(s−(1−s)η)4and the wholesale price isα*=m+PB+λ(s−(1−s)η)2=α`η; andfor<λ<ss−(1−s)ηλ4,then the optimal retail price ispr*=PBand the wholesale price is α* = PB− ε.The results for the case of tb≤ m  <  taare similar to those of Proposition 7 with λ2areplaced with λ2band λ3areplaced with λ3b. From Part I of Proposition 7, if η ≤ s/(1 − s) then additional spending makes selling gift cards through a retailer profitable at higher redemption rate than without additional spending. For maximum redemption rates required to sell to Dual or all consumers increase by a factor ofss−(1−s)η>0,which is increasing in η as expected. From Part II, for η  >  s/(1 − s), it is optimal to have the retailer sell gift cards to all consumer segments first at a high redemption rate, and as the redemption rate decreases, it becomes suboptimal to have the retailer sell gift cards through a retailer to all consumer segments. This different effect of the redemption rate between Parts I and II occurs because for a low s, a large portion of the additional spending stays with the SP as profit. Therefore, even a small η can be profitable for the SP when the redemption rate is high. This makes it optimal to have the retailer sell gift cards to all consumers at high redemption rates and to fewer consumer segments at low redemption rates. Conversely, for a high s, a small portion of the additional spending stays with the SP as profit and the smaller the profit the SP gets from higher redemption rates.In addition,d(ss−(1−s)η)ds=−η(s−η(1−s))2<0,which implies that additional spending has the largest impact for focus SPs and the smallest effect for low-cost SPs. This is also intuitive because most of the additional spending stays as profit with a focus SP due to the larger margin. Table 3 shows that with η = 0.2, a low-cost SP will sell gift cards to Dual consumers at a redemption rate higher by 0.029 than when η = 0, a differentiation SPs will do the same at a redemption rate higher by 0.081 than when η = 0, and a focus SP will do the same even at a 100 percent redemption. Table 3 also shows that for a large additional spending of η = 1.5, it is optimal for a focus SP to sell gift cards through a medium (small) retailer to Dual consumers for redemption rate satisfying 0 ≤ λ  <  0.348 (0 ≤ λ  <  0.949) and to all consumers for λ ≥ 0.348 (λ ≥ 0.949). In this case, η  >  s/(1 − s) and it is optimal for the SP to sell gift cards through a retailer to more consumer segments as the redemption rate increases.While the above analysis of the effects of extra spending is conducted for the no-gift-givers case, extra spending will result in the same effects for the gift-givers case. Thus, additional spending by the gift recipients makes selling gift cards through a retailer profitable at higher redemption rate than without additional spending.Since the SP’s general optimal pricing policy is quite complicated and does not provide insightful results about the effect of gift-givers, we develop a numerical experiment with the parameters shown in Table 4. The size of the consumption segment, i.e. C, is kept $10 for the models with and without gift-givers. The size of the gift-givers segment, i.e. G, is manipulated using x. The parameters [ρ1, ρ2] = [0, 1], [ρ1, ρ2] = [0.5, 0.5], and [ρ1, ρ2] = [0.75, 0.25] correspond to a large, medium, and small retailers, respectively. The margins [0.2, 0.3, 0.4] correspond to a low-cost/differentiation SP and the margins [0.5, 0.6, 0.7] correspond to a focus SP. The relative values of t and h were also chosen to reflect the customer profiles of three SP types. This setup results in a total of 2880 problems for each SP type. Without gift-givers, γi, i = 1, 2, 3 and xj, are not applicable, which reduces the number of problems to 144 for each SP type.The results for low-cost/differentiation SP with large retailer are shown in Tables 5and 6. As Table 5shows, the average redemption rate at which the SP will have a large retailer sell gift cards to all consumers (consumption and gift-givers) is 88 percent and those consumers spend on average 57 percent above the gift cards value. Taking into consideration that consumers in this case are price sensitive and consumption segments consumers buy gift cards to save money, it is unlikely to have the combination of λ = 0.88 and η = 0.57. Thus, it is most likely in this supply chain that the SP will use the retailer to sell gift cards at face value to gift-givers only, e.g. Walmart selling Taco Bell, Subway, and Olive Garden gift cards at no discount to face value. Interestingly, the retailer’s profit is not independent of the redemption rate since as the redemption rate decreases, the SP prefers to sell more gift cards to more consumer segments which benefits the retailer. Since the retailer’s profit when the optimal solution is at a retail price of Pr= 1 depends on the amount of profit (ε) per $1 of gift card the SP leaves the retailer, the profit of the retailer is unknown. In the cells in Table 6 where the retailer’s profit is up the discretion of the SP, the retailer’s optimal prices per $1 of gift card are 1 and 1 − h for wholesale prices up to 1 and 1 − h, respectively. Thus, the SP can set the wholesale prices to 1 − ε or 1 − h − ε, where ε provides just enough profit for the retailer to make it worthwhile for her to sell the gift cards. Table 5 also shows that without gift-givers, the SP will not sell gift cards through a retailer in 36.1 percent of the problems and in the 63.9 percent of the problems the SP sells gift cards to all consumers through the retailer, the retailer’s profit is up to the SP’s discretion. Thus, the existence of gift-givers strengths the position of the retailer. Table 6 shows that while holding the consumption segment size constant, adding the gift-givers results in on average a 14.1 percent increase in the SP’s profit. The last column in Table 6 shows that adding a large retailer channel to sell gift card results in a 3.1 percent increase in the profit of the SP when the retailer sells gift cards to all gift-givers.Table 7shows that in 29.8 percent of the problems, a low-cost/differentiation SP finds it optimal to have a medium size retailer sells gift cards to all consumers. These problems have a low redemption rate of 86 percent, low consumer holding and transaction costs of 5.55 percent each, and a large additional spending beyond gift cards’ value of 67 percent. Therefore, it is unlikely that in this type of supply chain the SP will have the retailer sell gift cards to all consumers. Having the retailer sell gift cards to all gift-givers and Dual consumption consumers occurs at a more realistic redemption rate of 89 percent, but still at a high additional spending of 41 percent. An example of this may be the Outback and Chilli’s selling gift cards through the BJ’s Club at 4 percent discount as shown in Fig. 1. Table 7 also shows that without gift-givers, the SP does not sell gift cards through a retailer in 18.8 percent of the problems and in 44.4 percent of the problems she sells gift cards to Dual consumption consumers and her profit is up to the SP’s discretion. Table 8shows that when the retailer sells gift cards to all gift-givers and Dual consumption consumers, she extracts 1.62 percent of the supply chain profits. The last column in Table 8 shows that adding a medium retailer channel to sell gift card results in a 20.5 percent increase in the profit of the SP when the retailer sells gift cards to all gift-givers and Dual consumption consumers.Table 9shows that the average parameter values to have a small retailer sell gift cards of a focus SP to all gift-givers and consumption consumers is unlikely, particularly since the average additional spending is at 71 percent. However, the average parameter values for having the small retailer sell a focus SP gift cards to retailer-only and Dual gift-givers as well as Dual consumption consumers are realistic, particularly when considering the profile of focus SP consumers. Table 9 also shows that without gift-givers, the SP does not sell gift cards through a retailer in 13.2 percent of the problems and in 60.4 percent of the problems the SP sells gift cards to Dual consumption consumers. When it is optimal for the SP to have the retailer sell gift cards to retailer-only and Dual gift-givers and Dual consumption consumers, Table 10shows that the retailer extracts 0.26 percent of the supply chain profits and the SP’s profit increases by 14.2 percent as shown in the last column of Table 10.We also examined the impact of centralization on the supply chain with gift-givers. As Table 11shows, in 25 percent of the problems, centralization does not result in improvements is profits. These are the problems where the solutions occur at a retail price of 1 − h or 1 − h − t and the manufacturer extracts all the profit in the decentralized supply chain. In the other 75 percent of the problems, the average improvement was quite small (1 percent–2 percent) and the maximum improvement was 13 percent. Thus, similar to the results with no gift-givers in Section 4, centralization does not result in as large of an increase in profits as in a typical manufacturer–retailer supply chain.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We developed a model of an SP who directly sells goods and services or gift cards which can be used for purchasing these goods and services to consumers. The SP can also sell gift cards through an independent retailer. Gift cards are sold at face value by the SP, otherwise consumers can buy them on the spot to pay for goods and services. However, gift cards may be sold at face value or a discount through a retailer. Consumers are divided into consumption and gift-giving segments, with some consumers belonging to both segments. All consumption consumers are customers of the SP while some consumers are also customers of the retailer resulting in two subsegments, the SP-only segment and the Dual segment, respectively. The gift-givers segment also has these two subsegments (SP-only and Dual) in addition to a Retailer-only subsegment.Consistent with the literature (Neslin et al., 2006; Tang, 2006), we find that advance selling and the new channel increase supply chain profit. While the reasons for the increased profit include the known market expansion and ability to price discriminate, the use of gift cards brings about other reasons. In particular, non-redemption of some gift cards and additional spending by gift card recipients above the gift cards’ value.Our results indicate that without gift-givers, it is suboptimal for the SP to sell gift cards through a retailer unless slippage is high and/or gift card redeemers spend additional money above the gift cards’ value. Interestingly, the SP does not always prefer a low redemption rate. For an SP with high margin and customers who spend significant amount of money beyond the redeemed gift cards’ value, the SP benefits from high gift card redemption rates.With gift-givers, it becomes optimal for the SP to sell gift cards through the retailer if there are some retailer-only customers, even if the gift cards’ redemption rate is 100 percent. The optimal pricing of the SP depends on the relative values of the additional spending rate and the cost of goods and services sold rate. For a high additional spending rate relative to the cost rate, the SP benefits from high redemption and will use a wholesale price which makes the retailer serve more consumer segments if the redemption rate is high. For a low additional spending rate relative to the cost rate, the SP benefits from low redemption and will use a wholesale price which makes the retailer serve less consumer segments if the redemption rate is high. The optimal pricing of the retailer depends in part on the size of the total gift-givers consumer segment and the size of Retailer-only subsegment within it. The larger the sizes of the gift-givers segment and Retailer-only subsegment, the lower the wholesale price the retailer requires to sell gift cards to the same consumer segments compared to the no gift-givers case.We have contributed to the literature by analyzing a new type of supply chain in which the retailer does not sell the goods and services of the SP, but sells gift cards that can be used to purchase goods and services. Two results from our analysis were not anticipated from our analysis of this unique supply chain. First, for realistic gift cards redemption rates, centralization in the SP–retailer supply chain does not result in as significant of a decrease in retail price and an increase in supply chain profits as in a classic manufacturer–retailer supply chain. Second, under certain conditions, increases in the redemption rate result in increases in profit of the SP instead of decreases as would be expected.Our model has several limitations which merits further research. We used a Stacklberg game with the SP acting as the leader. Other schemes can be examined, including the retailer charging SP a fixed activation fee per card the retailer activates or profit sharing. We assumed fixed holding and transaction cost per consumer in the different consumer segments. These costs may be different among consumers of the same segment and may be assumed to follow a particular probability distribution. Finally, we used a linear demand function for gift cards and goods and services. While we expect our results to hold for closely related functions, extensions to other demand functions (Huang et al., 2013) will be useful.Suppose the SP uses optimal pricing of its products. The expected SP profit isπd,NG=Cv¯−pdv¯(pd−s). Sinced2πd,NGdpd2=−2Cv¯<0,πd, NGis concave in prand the optimal price ispd*=s+v¯2. Sincepd*is an normalized price level withpd*=1,v¯=2−sand an optimal expected profit ofπd,NG*=C(1−s)22−s.From Equation (3), if 1 − h − t  <  pr≤ 1 − h, the retailer sells to Dual consumers and her expected profit isπr2=Cv¯(pr−α)ρ2(v¯−h−pr),which is concave in prandpr2*=v¯−h+α2maximizes πr2. If pr≤ 1 − h − t, the retailer sells to all consumers and her expected profit isπr3=Cv¯(pr−α)(v¯−h−pr−ρ1t),which is concave in prandpr3*=v¯−h+α−ρ1t2maximizes πr3.Sincev¯=2−s,v¯−1=1−s=m>t.(1)Whenα≤2−h−2t−v¯,pr2*=v¯−h+α2≤1−h−t. Since πr2(pr= 1 − h − t)  <  πr3(pr= 1 − h − t), the retailer is better to sell to all consumers. In addition,pr3*=v¯−h+α−ρ1t2≤1−h−t−ρ1t2≤1−h−tforα≤2−h−2t−v¯. Therefore, it is optimal for the retailer to setpr*=pr3*=v¯−h+α−ρ1t2=m+PA+ρ2t+α2and sells to all consumers whenα≤2−h−2t−v¯.When2−h−2t−v¯<α≤2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t,1−h−t<pr2*≤1−h−t+ρ1t2<1−hand1−h−t−ρ1t2<pr3*≤1−h−t. Thus, the retailer can chargepr2*and sell to Dual consumers, or chargepr3*and sell to all consumers. We need to compareπr2(pr2*)withπr3(pr3*).Let▵π≡πr3(pr3*)−πr2(pr2*). It can be shown that ▵π is convex in α and ▵π = 0 has two roots:α1=v¯−h−t−ρ2tandα2=v¯−h−t+ρ2t.2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t−α1=−2(v¯−1)+(ρ2−ρ2)t<0,thus,2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t<α1and ▵π  >  0 when2−h−2t−v¯<α≤2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t=PA−m−ρ2t. Therefore, it is optimal for the retailer to setpr*=pr3*and sells to all consumers.When2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t<α≤2−h−v¯,1−h−t+ρ1t2<pr2*≤1−hand1−h−t<pr3*≤1−h−ρ1t2. Thus, the retailer can chargepr2*and sell to Dual consumers, or charge 1 − h − t and sell to all consumers. We need to compareπr2(pr2*)with πr3(1 − h − t).Let▵π≡πr3(1−h−t)−πr2(pr2*). It can be shown that ▵π  >  0 whenα=2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t,and∂▵π∂α<0for2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t<α≤2−h−v¯. Whenα=2−h−v¯,▵π = ρ1m2 − ρ1tm − ρ2t2 ≡ Ω which is convex in m, and Ω = 0 has two roots:ρ1−ρ1(1+3ρ2)2ρ1tandρ1+ρ1(1+3ρ2)2ρ1t≡ta. Sinceρ1−ρ1(1+3ρ2)2ρ1t<t≤ta,if m ≥ ta, then Ω ≥ 0 and ▵π ≥ 0 for2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t<α≤2−h−v¯. If t  <  m  <  ta, then Ω  <  0 and there existsαb∈(2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t,2−h−v¯]with ▵π(α = αb) = 0. Solving ▵π = 0, we getαb=ρ2(v¯−h)−2(v¯−1+ρ2t)+2ρ1(v¯−1)(v¯−1+ρ2t)ρ2=ρ2(m+PA−t)+2mρ1M1−2mρ2. Therefore,(i)if m ≥ ta, then it is optimal for the retailer to setpr*=1−h−t=PAand sell to all consumers when2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t=PA−m−ρ2t<α≤2−h−v¯;if t  <  m  <  ta, then it is optimal for the retailer to setpr*=1−h−t=PAand sell to all consumers when2−h−2t−v¯+ρ1t=PA−m−ρ2t<α≤αb,and setpr*=pr2*=v¯−h+α2=m+PB+α2and sell to Dual consumers whenαb<α≤2−h−v¯=PB−m.When2−h−v¯<α≤1−h−t,pr2*>1−handpr3*>1−h−t. Thus, the retailer can charge 1 − h and sell to Dual consumers, or charge 1 − h − t and sell to all consumers. We need to compare πr2(1 − h) with πr3(1 − h − t).Let ▵π ≡ πr3(1 − h − t) − πr2(1 − h). It can be shown that∂▵π∂α<0. From the analysis above, ▵π  <  0 whenα=2−h−v¯and t  <  m  <  ta. Therefore, ▵π  <  0 for2−h−v¯<α≤1−h−tif t  <  m  <  ta. If m ≥ ta, ▵π ≥ 0 whenα=2−h−v¯and ▵π ≤ 0 when α = 1 − h − t. Thus, there existsαa∈(2−h−v¯,1−h−t]with ▵π(α = αa) = 0. Solving ▵π = 0, we getαa=(1−h−t)(v¯−1+ρ2t)−(1−h)ρ2(v¯−1)t+ρ1(v¯−1−t)=PAM1−PBmρ2M2. Therefore,(i)if m ≥ ta, then it is optimal for the retailer to setpr*=1−h−t=PAand sell to all consumers when2−h−v¯<α≤αa,and setpr*=1−h=PBand sell to Dual consumers when αa<  α ≤ 1 − h − t;if t  <  m  <  ta, then it is optimal for the retailer to setpr*=1−h=PBand sell to Dual consumers when2−h−v¯=PB−m<α≤1−h−t.When 1 − h − t  <  α  <  1 − h = PB, the retailer only sells to Dual consumers and setspr*=1−h=PB.When α ≥ 1 − h, the retailer cannot make any profit for any price.The proof follows from Proposition 1/2 since ta= ∞ when ρ2 = 1, and all consumers are Dual consumers and t is irrelevant.1. ρ2  <  11/a. When m ≥ ta, we can show that PA− m − ρ2t = s − h − t − ρ2t  <  s − h ≤ αa<  1 − h − t  <  1 − h.(i)If α ≤ s − h − t − ρ2t, from Equation (4), the SP’s expected profit isπ^d=C2−s2−s−h−α−ρ1t2(α−λs). Sinceπ^dis concave in α, whenλ≤(3s−2−h−t−3ρ2t)/s≡λ^,π^dis maximized atα=(2−s−h−ρ1t+λs)/2=(m+PA+ρ2t+λs)/2≡α^withπ^d*=π^d(α^); and whenλ>λ^,it is maximized at α = s − h − t − ρ2t withπ^d*=π^d(s−h−t−ρ2t).If s − h − t − ρ2t  <  α ≤ αa, from Equation (4), the SP’s expected profit isπ˜d=C2−s(1−s+ρ2t)(α−λs),which is increasing in α. Thus,π˜dis maximized at α = αawithπ˜d*=π˜d(αa). It can be shown thatπ˜d(αa)>π^d(s−h−t−ρ2t).If αa<  α  <  1 − h, from Equation (4), the SP’s expected profit isπ¯d=(1−s)2Cρ12−s+(α−λs)Cρ22−s(1−s),which is increasing in α. Thus,π¯dis maximized at α = 1 − h − ε where ε is very small and positive, andπ¯d*=π¯d(1−h−ϵ)≈π¯d(1−h).If α ≥ 1 − h, the SP does not sell through an independent retailer and its expected profit isπˇd=C(1−s)22−s.We need to find out the SP’s optimal decision depending on the value of the consumers’ average redemption rate λ. We can show the following:•Letλ3a=3s−2−h−t−3ρ2t−8(1−s+ρ2t)(h+t+ρ2t−s+αa)s=PA−3m−3ρ2t−8(m+ρ2t)(m−PA+ρ2t+αa)s. Clearly,λ3a<λ^. When λ ≤ λ3a,π^d(α^)≥π˜d(αa); and when λ  >  λ3a,π˜d(αa)>π^d(α^).Letλ2a=αa(1−s+ρ2t)−ρ1(1−s)2−ρ2(1−s)(1−h)s(ρ1(1−s)+ρ2t)=αa(m+ρ2t)−ρ1m2−ρ2mPBs(ρ1m+ρ2t). When λ ≤ λ2a,π˜d(αa)≥π¯d(1−h); and when λ  >  λ2a,π¯d(1−h)>π˜d(αa).Letλ1=1−hs. When λ ≤ λ1,π¯d(1−h)≥πˇd; and when λ  >  λ1,πˇd>π¯d(1−h).It can be shown that λ1  >  λ2a, and λ2a>  λ3afor realistic parameters. Therefore,(a)If λ  >  λ1, thenπˇd>π¯d(1−h)>π˜d(αa)>π^d(α^). Thus, it is optimal for the SP not to sell gift cards through a retailer.If λ2a<  λ ≤ λ1, thenπ¯d(1−h)≥πˇdandπ¯d(1−h)>π˜d(αa)>π^d(α^). Thus, the SP’s optimal wholesale price is α* = 1 − h − ε = PB− ε and the retailer’s optimal retail price ispr*=1−h=PB.If λ3a<  λ ≤ λ2a, thenπ˜d(αa)≥π¯d(1−h)>πˇdandπ˜d(αa)>π^d(α^). Thus, the SP’s optimal wholesale price is α* = αaand the retailer’s optimal retail price ispr*=PA.If λ ≤ λ3a, thenπ^d(α^)≥π˜d(αa)>π¯d(1−h)>πˇd. Thus, the SP’s optimal wholesale price isα*=α^=m+PA+ρ2t+λs2and the retailer’s optimal retail price ispr*=m+PA+ρ2t+α*2=3(m+PA+ρ2t)+λs4.If α ≤ s − h − t − ρ2t, from Equation (5), the SP’s expected profit isπ^d=C2−s2−s−h−α−ρ1t2(α−λs). Sinceπ^dis concave in α, from 1/a/(i), whenλ≤λ^,π^dis maximized atα=α^withπ^d*=π^d(α^); and whenλ>λ^,it is maximized at α = s − h − t − ρ2t withπ^d*=π^d(s−h−t−ρ2t).If s − h − t − ρ2t  <  α ≤ αb, from Equation (5), the SP’s expected profit isπ˜d=C2−s(1−s+ρ2t)(α−λs),which is increasing in α. Thus,π˜dis maximized at α = αbwithπ˜d*=π˜d(αb). It can be shown thatπ˜d(αb)≥π^d(s−h−t−ρ2t).If αb<  α ≤ s − h, from Equation (5), the SP’s expected profit isπ`d=(1−s)2Cρ12−s+(α−λs)Cρ22−s2−s−h−α2. Sinceπ`dis concave in α, whenλb≡2αb−2+s+hs<λ≤λ`≡3s−2−hs,π`dis maximized atα=2−s−h+λs2≡α`withπ`d*=π`d(α`); when λ ≤ λb, it is maximized at α = αb+ ε withπ`d*=π`d(αb+ϵ)≈π`d(αb); and whenλ>λ`,it is maximized at α = s − h withπ`d*=π`d(s−h). It can be shown thatπ`d(αb)<π˜d(αb)for λ ≤ λb,π`d(α`)<π˜d(αb)forλb<λ≤λ`,andπ`d(s−h)<π¯d(1−h)forλ>λ`. Therefore, it is never optimal for the SP to charge a wholesale price such that αb<  α ≤ s − h.If s − h  <  α  <  1 − h, from Equation (5), the SP’s expected profit isπ¯d=(1−s)2Cρ12−s+(α−λs)Cρ22−s(1−s),which is increasing in α. Thus,π¯dis maximized at α = 1 − h − ε where ε is very small and positive, andπ¯d*=π¯d(1−h−ϵ)≈π¯d(1−h).If α ≥ 1 − h, the SP does not sell through an independent retailer and its expected profit isπˇd=C(1−s)22−s.We need to find out the SP’s optimal decision depending on the value of the consumers’ average redemption rate λ. We can show the following:•Letλ3b=3s−2−h−t−3ρ2t−8(1−s+ρ2t)(h+t+ρ2t−s+αa)s=PA−3m−3ρ2t−8(m+ρ2t)(m−PA+ρ2t+αb)s. Clearly,λ3b<λ^. When λ ≤ λ3b,π^d(α^)≥π˜d(αb); and when λ  >  λ3b,π˜d(αb)>π^d(α^).Letλ2b=αb(1−s+ρ2t)−ρ1(1−s)2−ρ2(1−s)(1−h)s(ρ1(1−s)+ρ2t)=αb(m+ρ2t)−ρ1m2−ρ2mPBs(ρ1m+ρ2t). When λ ≤ λ2b,π˜d(αb)≥π¯d(1−h); and when λ  >  λ2b,π¯d(1−h)>π˜d(αb).Whenλ≤λ1=1−hs,π¯d(1−h)≥πˇd; and when λ  >  λ1,πˇd>π¯d(1−h).It can be shown that λ1  >  λ2b, and λ2b>  λ3bfor realistic parameters. Similar to Case 1/a above, the result follows.2. ρ2 = 1(i)If α ≤ s − h, from Equation (6), the SP’s expected profit isπ`d=C2−s2−s−h−α2(α−λs). Sinceπ`dis concave in α, whenλ≤λ`=3s−2−hs,π`dis maximized atα=2−s−h+λs2=α`withπ`d*=π`d(α`); and whenλ>λ`,it is maximized at α = s − h withπ`d*=π`d(s−h).If s − h  <  α  <  1 − h, from Equation (6), the SP’s expected profit isC2−s(1−s)(α−λs),which is increasing in α. Thus,π¯dis maximized at α = 1 − h − ε, andπ¯d*=π¯d(1−h−ϵ)≈π¯d(1−h). It can be shown thatπ`d(s−h)<π¯d(1−h)forλ>λ`.If α ≥ 1 − h, the SP’s expected profit isπˇd=C(1−s)22−s.We can show the following:•Letλ4=3s−2−h−22(1−s)s. When λ ≤ λ4,π`d(α`)≥π¯d(1−h); and when λ  >  λ4,π¯d(1−h)>π`d(α`).Whenλ≤λ1=1−hs,π¯d(1−h)≥πˇd; and when λ  >  λ1,πˇd>π¯d(1−h).Clearly,λ4<λ`<λ1. The result follows.The proof follows from Lemma 1 and Proposition 2.The retailer’s and SP’s expected profit functions when t  <  hThe retailer’s expected profit is(A.1)πr={πr0=0,ifpr>1πr1=1v¯(pr−α)G(γ2+γ3)(v¯−pr),ifPC<pr≤1πr2=1v¯(pr−α)G(v¯−pr−γ1t),ifPB<pr≤PCπr3=1v¯(pr−α)[(G+Cρ2)(v¯−pr)−Cρ2h−Gγ1t],ifPA<pr≤PBπr4=1v¯(pr−α)[(G+C)(v¯−pr)−Ch−Gγ1t−Cρ1t],ifPA≥pr.The SP’s expected profit is(A.2)πd={πd0=v¯−1v¯[(1−s)C+(1−λs)G(1−γ3)],ifpr>1πd1=v¯−1v¯[(1−s)C+(1−λs)Gγ1]+Gv¯(α−λs)(γ3+γ2)(v¯−pr),ifPC<pr≤1πd2=v¯−1v¯(1−s)C+1v¯(α−λs)G(v¯−pr−γ1t),ifPB<pr≤PCπd3=v¯−1v¯(1−s)Cρ1+1v¯(α−λs)[(G+Cρ2)(v¯−pr)−Cρ2h−Gγ1t]],ifPA<pr≤PBπd4=1v¯(α−λs)[(G+C)(v¯−pr)−Ch−Gγ1t−Cρ1t],ifPA≥pr.With a large retailer, ρ2 = 1, γ1 = 0 and γ2 + γ3 = 1. Thus, all consumption consumers are Dual consumers and gift-givers are either Retailer-only or Dual gift-givers, and the transaction cost t incurred by the SP-only consumers/gift-givers is irrelevant. From (8), only πr1 and πr2 can happen, with the retail price at 1 − h  <  pr≤ 1 and pr≤ 1 − h, respectively.I. Suppose the retailer charges 1 − h  <  pr≤ 1. Her expected profit is πr1, which is concave in pr.•When α ≥ s, πr1 is maximized at pr= 1 andπr1(1)=Gv¯(1−α)(1−s)≡πr1a.When s − 2h  <  α  <  s, πr1 is maximized atpr=2−s+α2≡pr1andπr1(pr1)=Gv¯(2−s−α)24≡πr1b.When α ≤ s − 2h, πr1 is maximized at pr= 1 − h + ε andπr1(1−h+ϵ)=Gv¯(1−h−α−ϵ)(1−s+h+ϵ)≡πr1c.Whenα≥s−2h+ChG+C=s−h(x+2)x+1,πr2 is maximized at pr= 1 − h andπr2(1−h)=1v¯(1−h−α)[G(1−s+h)+C(1−s)]=Gv¯(1−h−α)((1−s)(1+x)+h)≡πr2a.Whenα<s−h(x+2)x+1,πr2 is maximized atpr=(G+C)(2−s+α)−Ch2(G+C)=(1+x)(2−s+α)−xh2(1+x)≡pr2andπr2(pr2)=1v¯((G+C)(2−s−α)−Ch)24(G+C)=Gv¯((1+x)(2−s−α)−xh)24(1+x)≡πr2b.If s ≤ α  <  1, then only πr1aand πr2aare possible. It can be shown that πr1a− πr2ais increasing in α and whenα=h(s−mx)+mx−h2h+mx≡αA1,πr1a− πr2a= 0.1.Ifm=1−s≥x+x2+4x2xh,then s ≤ αA1  <  1. When s ≤ α  <  αA1, πr2a>  πr1aandpr*=1−h. When αA1 ≤ α  <  1, πr1a>  πr2aandpr*=1.Ifm=1−s<x+x2+4x2xh,thenαA2≡s−h(x+2)x+1<αA1<s. When s ≤ α  <  1, πr1a>  πr2aandpr*=1.If αA2 ≤ α  <  s, then only πr1band πr2aare possible. It can be shown that πr1b− πr2ais convex in α and is increasing in α for αA2 ≤ α  <  s. Whenα=s−2h−2mx+2m2x(1+x)+mxh≡αA3,πr1b− πr2a= 0.1.Ifm=1−s≥x+x2+4x2xh,then αA3 ≥ s. When αA2 ≤ α  <  s, πr2a>  πr1bandpr*=1−h.Ifm=1−s<x+x2+4x2xh,then αA2  <  αA3  <  s. When αA2 ≤ α  <  αA3, πr2a>  πr1bandpr*=1−h. When αA3 ≤ α  <  s, πr1b>  πr2aandpr*=2−s+α2.If s − 2h  <  α  <  αA2, then only πr1band πr2bare possible. It can be shown that πr1b− πr2bis concave in α and πr1b<  πr2bfor s − 2h  <  α  <  αA2. Therefore,pr*=(1+x)(α+2−s)−xh2(1+x)for s − 2h  <  α  <  αA2.If α ≤ s − 2h, then only πr1cand πr2bare possible. It can be shown that πr1c<  πr2b. Therefore,pr*=(1+x)(α+2−s)−xh2(1+x)for α ≤ s − 2h.The result follows by summarizing parts (a)–(d).The proof follows the similar procedure of Proposition 3.1.αa− αD2 for all gift-givers and consumption.1 − h − αD1 for all gift-givers and dual consumption.The proof follows the similar procedure of Proposition 3.We show the case of ρ2  <  1. The proof of the case of ρ2 = 1 is similar. Sinced2π`Idβ2=−2Cρ22−s<0andd2π^Idβ2=−2C2−s<0,π`Iandπ^Iare concave with unrestricted optimums ofβ`=12(2−h−s(1−λ))andβ^=12(2−h−s(1−λ)−tρ1)onπ`Iandπ^I,respectively. Bothβ`andβ^are strictly increasing in λ. Also,β`−β^=tρ12. Thusβ`>β^. Solvingβ`=1−h,β`=1−h−t,andβ^=1−h−tfor λ givesλ1=s−hs,λ7=s−h−2ts,andλ6=s−h−t−ρ2ts,respectively. Also, λ7  <  λ6  <  λ1, and thus, if λ6  <  λ ≤ λ1 thenβ`is optimal onπ`I; if λ  >  λ1 then β = 1 − h is optimal onπ`I; if λ ≤ λ6 then β = 1 − h − t + ε (ε is positive and very small) is optimal onπ`I; if λ ≤ λ6 thenβ^is optimal onπ^I,and if λ  >  λ6 then β = 1 − h − t is optimal onπ^I. We identify the following exhaustive cases.1.λ  >  λ1.(i)β = 1 − h is optimal onπ`Iandπ`I(1−h)=C2−s[ρ1(1−s)2+ρ2(1−h−λs)(1−s)].π`I(1−h)−πˇI=Cρ22−s(1−s)(s−h−λs)which is decreasing in λ. Since at λ = λ1,π`I(1−h)=πˇI,π`I(1−h)<πˇIfor λ  >  λ1.β = 1 − h − t = PAis optimal onπ^Iandπ^I(PA)=C2−s(1−s+ρ2t)(1−h−t−λs).π^I(PA)−πˇI=C2−s[(1−s+ρ2t)(1−h−t−λs)−(1−s)2]which is decreasing in λ. Since at λ = λ1,π^I(PA)−πˇI=−Ct2−s[(1−s)ρ1+ρ2t]<0,π^I(PA)<πˇIfor λ  >  λ1,From (1/i) and (1/ii), it is not optimal for the supply chain to sell through the retailer.λ6  <  λ ≤ λ1.(i)β`is optimal onπ`Iandπ`I(β`)=C2−s[ρ1(1−s)2+ρ24(2−h−s−λs)2)].π`I(β`)−πˇI=Cρ24(2−s)(s−h−λs)(4−h−3s−λs)>0for λ  <  λ1. Thus,π`I(β`)>πˇIfor λ  <  λ1.β = PAis optimal onπ^I. It can be shown thatπ`I(β`)−π^I(PA)is convex in λ. Solvingπ`I(β`)−π^I(PA)=0,gives two roots with a larger root ofλ5=ρ2(2−h−s−2t)−2m+2m2ρ12+ρ1ρ2tmsρ2withρ2(2−h−s−2t)−2msρ2<λ6<λ5<λ1. Therefore, for λ5  <  λ ≤ λ1,π`I(β`)>π^I(PA)and for λ6  <  λ ≤ λ5,π`I(β`)≤π^I(PA).From (2/i) and (2/ii), when λ5  <  λ ≤ λ1,β*=β`,and when λ6  <  λ ≤ λ5, β* = PA.λ7  <  λ ≤ λ6.(i)β`is optimal onπ`I. From (2/i),π`I(β`)>πˇIfor λ7  <  λ ≤ λ6.β^is optimal onπ^Iandπ^I(β^)=C4(2−s)(2−h−s−t+ρ2t−λs)2. It can be shown thatπ^I(β^)−π`I(β`)is convex in λ. Solvingπ^I(β^)−π`I(β`)=0gives a smaller root atλ=2−h−s−t−4m2+ρ2t2s>λ6. Thus,π^I(β^)>π`I(β`)for λ7  <  λ ≤ λ6.From (3/i) and (3/ii),β*=β^for λ7  <  λ ≤ λ6.λ ≤ λ7.β = 1 − h − t + ε is optimal onπ`Iandβ^is optimal onπ^I. From (3/ii),π^I(β^)>π`I(β`)for λ  <  λ6. Sinceπ`I(β`)>π`I(1−h−t+ϵ)andπ`I(β`)>πˇIfor λ  <  λ1,π^I(β^)achieves the maximum profit andβ*=β^for λ ≤ λ7.The proof follows from Propositions 2 and 6.The proof follows from comparing Propositions 2 and 6.The proof is obtained similarly to Proposition 2 with two cases: I. η ≤ s/(1 − s) and II. η  >  s/(1 − s).Corollary 6For a medium retailer (ρ2 = 0.5) and an SP with m ≥ ta,•if α ≥ 1 − h, the retailer cannot make any profit for any price;ifαa=1−h−(2−2s+t)t1−s+t<α<1−h,the retailer setspr*=1−hand sells to only Dual consumers;ifs−h−3t2<α≤αa,the retailer setspr*=1−h−tand sells to all consumers; andifα≤s−h−3t2,the retailer setspr*=1−12(s+h+t2−α)and sells to all consumers.For a small retailer (ρ2 = 0.25) and an SP with m ≥ ta,•if α ≥ 1 − h, the retailer cannot make any profit for any price.ifαa=1−h−(4−4s+t)t3−3s+t<α<1−h,the retailer setspr*=1−hand sells to only Dual consumers;ifs−h−5t4<α≤αa,the retailer setspr*=1−h−tand sells to all consumers; andifα≤s−h−5t4,the retailer setspr*=1−12(s+h+3t4−α)and sells to all consumers.
