@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Nowadays, many healthcares are generating and collecting a huge amount of medical data. Due to the difficulty of analyzing this massive volume of data using traditional methods, medical data mining on Electronic Health Record (EHR) has been a major concern in medical research. Therefore, it is necessary to assess EHR architectures based on the capabilities of extracting useful medical knowledge from a huge amount of EHR databases. In this paper, we develop a bi-level interactive decision support framework to identify data mining-oriented EHR architectures. The contribution of this bi-level framework is fourfold: (1) it develops Interactive Simple Additive Weighting (ISAW) model from an individual single-level environment to a group bi-level environment; (2) it utilizes decision makers’ preferences gradually in the course of interactions to reach to a consensus on an data mining-oriented EHR architecture; (3) it considers fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets to represent ambiguous, uncertain or imprecise information; and (4) it synthesizes a representative outcome based on qualitative and quantitative indicators in the EHR assessment process. A case study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed bi-level interactive framework for benchmarking a national data mining-oriented EHR.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Medical knowledge is the most valuable asset of a healthcare organization. Extracting hidden knowledge from patients’ raw data helps physicians to identify effective diagnostic and treatment methods. In simpler terms, the efficacy of patient care can be improved with turning medical data into medical knowledge. Clearly, it is not surprising that healthcare organizations have been interested in medical data mining to support physician decisions.Nowadays, many healthcare organizations are generating and collecting a huge amount of medical data such as demographics, vital signs, laboratory data, radiology reports, and progress notes in EHR architectures. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess EHR architectures based on the capabilities of extracting useful medical knowledge from a huge amount of EHR data.There are two main challenges in turning data from EHR architecture into medical knowledge:(1)EHR data may not be optimal for medical data mining operations. EHR data quality determines whether the data mining process is successful or not;traditional methods cannot be used to analyze massive volumes of EHR data. This explosive growth of patients’ raw data requires an automated way to extract useful knowledge from EHRs.In order to overcome to the above challenges in the EHR architecture, we must consider the first challenge prior to the second one.Several papers in the current literature have focused on implementation of EHR in healthcare information technologies [9,10,16,5,19]. A study of a number of papers indicates adoption of electronic health records [13,14]. Further studies have been applied to assess performance of an Electronic Health Record and the right expectations for the EHR standard [29,37,22,25].Academic researchers have established a link between medical data mining techniques and EHRs [20,4,2,17,24,8].A number of studies have focused on the application of interactive approaches [35,33,28,36,1,7,18,30,6,27,31,32].To our best knowledge, there is no model in the existing literature to response to the mentioned challenges. This paper develops a bi-level model to assess different EHR architectures in order to identify a data mining-oriented EHR architecture.This bi-level model consists of the following two sub-models:(1)Leader sub-model: we assess the data quality of EHR architectures based on a data mining approach. In other words, the leader sub-model objective is to eliminate the less favorable EHR architectures with respect to EHR data quality indicators;Follower sub-model: we assess the rest of EHR architectures based on the capabilities of extracting useful medical knowledge from a huge amount of EHR data. In other words, the follower sub-model objective is to select the EHR architecture with the most applicable data to discovery medical knowledge.A difficulty of the EHR architecture identification decision originates from the presence of more than one criterion at each sub-model. Therefore, we develop a bi-level Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model to identify the data-mining-oriented EHR. Table 1compares advantages and disadvantages of MCDM methods:As shown in Table 1, the weaknesses of both a priori and a posteriori methods can be overcome if decision makers can direct the EHR identification process according to their preferences. Thus, we formulate the data mining-oriented EHR identification problem using a novel bi-level interactive model. As decision makers express their judgments using linguistic terms, the bi-level interactive model is considered in the fuzzy environment.This paper is organized into six sections. In Section 2, we illustrate the details of the proposed framework. In Section 3, we present a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the bi-level interactive framework. In Section 4, we validate the bi-level interactive model. In Section 5, we compare the bi-level ISAW model method with the single-level ISAW method. The paper presents conclusions and future research directions in Section 6.The modular model depicted in Fig. 1along with the mathematical notations and definitions presented in Appendix A are used to identify the data mining-oriented EHR architecture:As shown in Fig. 1, the proposed framework for the identification of a data mining-oriented EHR architecture is divided into the following four phases:Phase 1Establishing the Medical Data Mining teamIn the first phase, a Medical Data Mining (MDM) team is established to assess EHRs as follows:(1)TDataMining_=[DM(1),DM(2),…,DM(r),…,DM(f)]where DM(k) indicates the member k of the MDM team. Thus it is the name of the team member k.Next, a voting power weight to each of the members of the team is determined as follows:(2)V(T)_=[vDM(1),vDM(2),…,vDM(r),…,vDM(f)]wherevDM(k)indicates the voting power of the MDM member k. Thus it is a numerical variable.Phase 2Calculation of the collective preferencesThis phase is divided into the following five processes:Process 2-1Identification of the EHR architecturesIn this process, alternative EHR architectures are identified. Let us assume that EHRs have been identified as follows:(3)AEHR_=[AEHR(1),AEHR(2),…,AEHR(m1)]where AEHR(i) indicates the name of the EHR i.Process 2-2Identification of the EHR data quality indicatorsIn this process, the EHR data quality indicators to assess available data through EHRs are identified. Let us assume that we have the following EHR data quality indicators at the leader sub-model of the bi-level model:(4)I(1)_=[I1(1),I2(1),…,In1(1)]where Ij1(1) indicates the name of the EHR data quality indicator j1.Process 2-3Identification of the medical data mining indicatorsIn this process, the medical data mining indicators to assess the EHRs are identified. Let us assume that we have the following medical data mining indicators at the follower sub-model of the bi-level model:(5)I(2)_=[I1(2),I2(2),…,In2(2)]where Ij2(2) indicates the name of the medical data mining indicator j2.Process 2-4Determination of the fuzzy individual preferencesIn this process, the fuzzy individual preferences are determined by the individual ordinal ranking matrices presented in Tables 2 and 3:Process 2-5Calculation of the fuzzy weighted collective preferencesIn this process, the fuzzy weighted collective preferences are calculated to using the weighted collective ordinal ranking matrices given in Table 4and Table 5:where(6)r˜i1j1(1)=∑k=1fvDM(k).r˜i1j1k(1)∑k=1fvDM(k)i1=1,2,…,m1;j1=1,2,…,n1r˜i2j2(2)=∑k=1fvDM(k).r˜i2j2k(2)∑k=1fvDM(k)i2=1,2,…,m2;j2=1,2,…,n2Phase 3Construction of the fuzzy interactive bi-level modelIn this phase, the bi-level interactive model is constructed to identify the data mining-oriented EHR. This phase is divided into the following two processes:Process 3-1Identification of the initial feasible order of the EHR architecturesIn this process, the EHRs are ranked based on Lexicographic method as an initial feasible order of the EHRs.Process 3-2Construction of the fuzzy bi-level interactive modelIn this process, the fuzzy bi-level interactive decision support model for the data mining-oriented EHR identification would be constructed as follows:The fuzzy bi-level interactive decision support model (1)The fuzzy leader interactive sub-modelMaxy1(ot)St:B˜1(ot).X1(ot)_+y1(ot).1_=B˜h1(ot)X1(ot)_≥0y1(ot):UnconstrainedThe fuzzy follower interactive sub-modelMaxy2(ot)St:B˜2(ot)⋅X2(ot)_+y2(ot)⋅1_=B˜h2(ot)X2(ot)_≥0y2(ot):UnconstrainedwhereX1(ot)_=[x11(ot),x21(ot),…,xm1−11(ot)]X2(ot)_=[x12(ot),x22(ot),…,xm2−12(ot)]1_is the unit column vectorPhase 4Identification of the data mining-oriented EHR architectureIn this phase, the team identifies the data mining-oriented EHR using the optimal solution of the fuzzy bi-level interactive model (1).This phase is divided into the following two processes:Process 4-1Elimination of the less favorable EHR architecture from the EHR data quality perspectiveIn this process, the leader sub-model is used to eliminate the less favorable EHRs. Fig. 2illustrates a bi-level interactive decision making flowchart as a part of the decision support framework at the leader sub-model:The iterative nature of the bi-level decision support model involves alternating between “solutions of the leader and follower sub-models” and “the MDM team's preferences” within a limited number of iterations, as shown in Fig. 3:In the bi-level interactive model, we solve a series of Linear Programming (LP) models to obtain the set of feasible orders of the EHRs. This sequence of the orders is, after a finite number of iterations, converged to the most preferred order of the EHRs as follows:In the Process 4-1, we define an initial feasible order of m1 EHRs using Lexicographic method at the first iteration. Then, we identify a preferred order of m1 EHRs using the leader sub-model of the bi-level interactive model. After that we present this order of the EHRs to the MDM team. If this order is accepted by the team, it will be the most preferred order of m1 EHRs from the quality data perspective. Otherwise, we ask the team to improve the current order of the EHRs. For this purpose, at an optimal solution of the leader interactive sub-model, a positive value of any decision variable xh(ot) allows the team to switch the EHR architecture in the position h of the feasible order to the EHR architecture in the position h+1. In fact, if the team corrects only this adjacent pair maintains feasibility through the interactive process. Consequently, the team corrects the current order of the EHR architectures by switching an adjacent pair which its decision variable has a positive value.In the next iterations, we use the leader sub-model to generate other orders of m1 EHRs with respect to the preferred orders obtained at the last iterations. We continue this interactive process at the leader interactive sub-model until the MDM team accept not to switch any adjacent pair which its decision variable has a positive value. Therefore, the team is confident that has found the most preferred order of the EHR architectures with respect to the EHR data quality indicators, as shown in Fig. 3.Process 4-2Identification of the data mining-oriented EHR architectureIn this process, the follower interactive sub-model is used to identify the data mining-oriented EHR. Fig. 2 illustrates the bi-level interactive decision making flowchart as a part of the bi-level interactive framework at the follower sub-model:In the Process 4-2, we use the most preferred order of m2 EHRs obtained from the leader sub-model as an initial feasible order of EHRs at the follower sub-model. Then, we determine a preferred order of m2 EHRs using the follower sub-model. After that we present this order of the EHRs to the MDM team. If this order is accepted by the team, it will be the most preferred order of EHRs from the mining data perspective. Otherwise, we ask the team to improve the current order of the EHRs. Consequently, the team corrects the current order of the EHR architectures by switching an adjacent pair which its decision variable has a positive value.In the next iterations, we use the follower sub-model to generate other orders of m2 EHRs with respect to the preferred orders obtained at the last iterations. We continue this interactive process at the follower interactive sub-model until the MDM team accept not to switch any adjacent pair which its decision variable has a positive value. Therefore, the team is confident that has found the most preferred order of the EHR architectures with respect to the medical data mining indicators, as shown in Fig. 3.EHR architectures at a country11The country name in this case study has not been mentioned to protect its anonymity.currently did not create a common approach for different parts of the national EHR. For this purpose, the country's ministry of health made a commitment to develop a national EHR in order to (1) establish data standards across the country; (2) define data life cycles; (3) modify and update EHR information across the country; (4) share EHR information in 24h; (2) enable retrieval of EHR information across the country; (5) eliminate physical limitations; (6) facilitate the integration of an enormous amount of medical information; and (7) provide medical knowledge-based solutions to patient centered needs.After a careful analysis of the problem, the ministry of health suggested to utilize the proposed bi-level interactive framework for the national data mining-oriented EHR identification as follows.In the phase 1, the MDM team was established to evaluate national EHR architectures as follows:T(DataMining)_=DM(1),DM(2),DM(3),DM(4)Next, a voting power weight to each of the members of the MDM team was determined as follows:V(T)_=vDM(1),vDM(2),vDM(3),vDM(4)In the Process 2-1, the team identified six national EHR architectures in the following countries [3,11,26]:AEHR(1):National EHR architecture in Sweden(HL7v3, openEHR, EHRCom)AEHR(2):National EHR architecture in Denmark(openEHR, EDIFACT)AEHR(3):National EHR architecture in England(HL7v3, CDA, ASTM CCR, CCD)AEHR(4):National EHR architecture in the Netherlands(HL7v3)AEHR(5):National EHR architecture in Australia(CDA, openEHR)AEHR(6):National EHR architecture in Canada(HL7v3, CDA, IHE, DICOM)In the Process 2-2, a list of medical data mining indicators to evaluate available data through EHRs was identified presented in Tables 6 and 7:Where HealthMiner® is a medical knowledge discovery tool that uses unsupervised search methods to find associations among diagnosis, procedure, and laboratory result entries that are contained in patient records. It is a revolutionary new technology that enables the large-scale analysis of medical data sets without bias or prior assumptions.In the Process 2-4, the fuzzy weighted collective ordinal EHR ranking matrices were constructed.Furthermore, among the various types of fuzzy numbers, triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are most important. We chose trapezoidal fuzzy numbers for the case study because they are used most often for characterizing imprecise, vague and ambiguous information in practical applications. The common use of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is mainly attributed to their simplicity in both concept and computation. A fuzzy set A is called trapezoidal fuzzy number with tolerance interval [a,b], left width α and right width β if its membership function with the notation A=(a, b, α, β) has the following form:1−1−tαifa−α≤t≤α1ifa≤t≤b1−t−bβifa≤t≤b+β0otherwiseFor example, the trapezoidal fuzzy number with the membership function presented in Fig. 5indicates the fuzzy weighted collective ordinal rank of the EHR architecture in Canada with respect to the accuracy indicator. The mathematical calculations of the fuzzy weighted collective ordinal rank of the EHR in Canada with respect to the accuracy indicator in the leader sub-model are presented in Appendix B.Similarly, the trapezoidal fuzzy number with the membership function presented in Fig. 6shows the fuzzy weighted collective ordinal rank of the EHR in Denmark with respect to the CliniMiner® indicator. The mathematical calculations of the fuzzy ordinal rank of the EHR at the follower sub-model are presented in Appendix B.In the Process 3-1, an initial feasible ordering of the EHRs was identified based on Lexicographic method as follows: [AEHR(4), AEHR(1), AEHR(2), AEHR(3), AEHR(6), AEHR(5)]In the Processes 3-2 and 3-3, and the bi-level interactive decision support model for the EHR identification were constructed as follows:The fuzzy bi-level interactive decision support model (2)The fuzzy leader interactive sub-modelMaxy1(o1)St:(0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(−3.0,−1.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(−5.0,−3.0,2.0,2.0)(3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0)(−4.0,−2.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(−4.0,−2.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(−2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(−2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0)(−2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(−3.0,−1.0,2.0,2.0)(3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0)(−2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0)x11(o1)x21(o1)x31(o1)x41(o1)x51(o1)+y1(o1).11111=(0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)(2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0)(1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0)x11(o1),x21(o1),x31(o1),x41(o1),x51(o1)3y1(o1):UnconstrainedThe fuzzy follower interactive sub-modelMaxy2(o1)St:(−1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0)(−2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0)(0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0)(−2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0)(0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0)(−2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0).x12(o1)x22(o1)x32(o1)+y2(o1).111=(−1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0)(−2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0)(0.0,2.0,2.0,2.0)x12(o1),x22(o1),x32(o1)≥0y2(o1):UnconstrainedThe mathematical calculations of the fuzzy ordinal matrix of the EHR architectures are presented in Appendix C.In the above bi-level interactive model, the MDM team's preferences were used during the iterative decision making process to direct the search to find the most preferred order of the six national EHRs as shown in Fig. 4:In the Process 4-1, the leader sub-model of the bi-level interactive model (2) involved alternating between “solutions of the leader sub-model” and “the MDM team's preferences”. The most preferred order of the six national EHRs from the EHR data quality perspective was found within two iterations as follows:At the first iteration, based on the initial feasible order of the six national EHR architectures [AEHR(4), AEHR(1), AEHR(2), AEHR(3), AEHR(6), AEHR(5)], the initial solution of the leader sub-model was resented as follows:[AEHR(1),AEHR(4),AEHR(2),AEHR(3),AEHR(6),AEHR(5)]This order was presented to the MDM team. It was not the acceptable order. Then, the team asked to switch the order of the national EHR in Denmark and the national EHR in the Netherlands. Therefore, the next preferred order was as follows: [AEHR(1), AEHR(2), AEHR(4), AEHR(3), AEHR(6), AEHR(5)]At the second iteration, the following order of the six national EHRs was obtained using the leader sub-model of the bi-level interactive model (2):[AEHR(1),AEHR(2),AEHR(4),AEHR(6),AEHR(5),AEHR(3)]Based on the team's response, the national EHR in Australia was preferred to the national EHR in Canada. Finally, as shown in Fig. 4, the most preferred order of the six national EHRs from the EHR data quality perspective was as follows: [AEHR(1), AEHR(2), AEHR(4)]In the Process 4-2, the follower sub-model of the bi-level interactive model involved alternating between “solutions of the follower sub-model” and “the MDM team's preferences”. The most preferred order of the three national EHRs from the medical data mining perspective was found as follows:At the first iteration of the follower sub-model of the bi-level interactive model (2), based on the most preferred order generated by the leader sub-model [AEHR(1), AEHR(2), AEHR(4)], the initial solution of the follower sub-model was presented as follows: [AEHR(1), AEHR(2), AEHR(4)]. Then, this order was presented to the MDM team. Based on the team's response, it was not the acceptable order from the medical data mining perspective. The team was unsatisfied with the relative positions of the national EHR in Denmark and the national EHR in Sweden, and suggested that the national EHR in Denmark should be ranked above the national EHR in Sweden. Therefore, the national EHR architecture in Denmark was selected as the most preferred national data mining-oriented EHR, as shown in Fig. 4.In this section, the verification of the bi-level interactive model was performed to demonstrate that the model is computing a sufficiently accurate solution. The bi-level interactive model verification was done by comparing the results of the model against the obtained result from the Group Analytical Hierarchy Process (GAHP) model. For this purpose, we constructed the AHP hierarchical structure presented in Fig. 7:The AHP hierarchical structure for the EHR identification consisted of three levels: EHR data quality indicators, medical data mining indicators, and EHR architectures, respectively. In This AHP hierarchical structure, the MDM team constructed pairwise comparison matrices for each element of a given level with respect to the indicators in the level immediately below. The first pairwise comparison matrix compared the five EHR data quality indicators. The pairwise comparison matrices at the second level, then investigated the relationships between the three data mining indicators. After that, pairwise comparison matrices at the third level compared the six EHR architectures with respect to the medical data mining indicators for the identification of the data mining-oriented EHR architecture. The results of both of the models showed the national EHR in Denmark as the most preferred support enabler to provide medical knowledge-based solutions. Once more, the model validation was tested with changing values of the voting power weights of the team members. The two models had the same results and the national EHR in Sweden was identified as data mining-oriented EHR architecture. Therefore, it was generally accepted that the bi-level interactive model was a valid model.Considering the bi-level ISAW model with m1 EHRs, n1 EHR data quality indicators, and n2 medical data mining indicators, we have:The size of the leader sub-model of the bi-level ISAW model will be (m1−1)×n1. Similarly, the size of the follower sub-model of the bi-level ISAW model will be ((m1/2)−1)×n2. As a result, the size of the bi-level ISAW model will be (m1−1)×n1+((m1/2)−1)×n2, while the size of the single-level ISAW model will be (m1−1)×(n1+n2).For example, the case study was comprised of 6 national EHRs, 5 EHR data quality indicators, and 3 medical data mining indicators. As a result, the sizes of the leader and follower sub-models of the bi-level ISAW model were 25 and 6, respectively. In other words, the size of the bi-level ISAW model was 31, while the size of the single-level ISAW model was 40.To compare the bi-level ISAW model method with the single-level ISAW method, the results of comparative analysis were shown in Fig. 8:In this paper, we presented a bi-level interactive decision support framework to identify the data mining-oriented EHR architecture. The novelty of this research and the contribution of the proposed bi-level interactive framework were fourfold: (1) it developed a fuzzy group bi-level ISAW model; (2) it utilized the leader and follower sub-models of the bi-level interactive model to reach the MDM team to a consensus on the data mining-oriented EHR architecture; (3) it considered fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets to represent ambiguous, uncertain or imprecise information; and (5) it synthesized a representative outcome based on two sets of the EHR data quality and medical data mining indicators.
