@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes relaxed conditions for control synthesis of discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy control systems under unreliable communication links. To widen the applicability of the fuzzy control approach under network environments, a novel fuzzy controller, which is homogenous polynomially parameter-dependent on both the current-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions and the multi-steps-past normalized fuzzy weighting functions, is provided to make much more use of the information of the underlying system. Moreover, a new kind of slack variable approach is also developed and thus the algebraic properties of these multi-instant normalized fuzzy weighting functions are collected into some augmented matrices. As a result, the conservatism of control synthesis of discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy control systems under unreliable communication links can be significantly reduced. Two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical development.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the real world, most of physical control systems are naturally nonlinear, and the inherent nonlinearity makes the problem of control design very hard. In the past several decades, the so-called Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model given in [1] has been acted as an effective tool in dealing with a variety of complex nonlinear problems, e.g., cluster-centric fuzzy modeling [2], fuzzy periodic oscillations [3] and fuzzy speed estimation [4]. In particular, the famous parallel distribution compensation (PDC) control scheme, which shares the same structure of the associated T–S fuzzy model, has been widely applied in control design and fruitful related results have been developed such as those in [5–8]. In order to reduce the conservatism, lots of relaxed methods via the so-called non-parallel distributed compensation(non-PDC) have attracted a rapidly growing interest in the existing literature, see [9–12] and those references therein. Recently, the so-called homogenous polynomially parameter-dependent solutions have been successfully applied to the problem of control synthesis of T–S fuzzy systems [13–15]. In particular, a slack variable technique has been developed by using the homogenous polynomial approach in [14], and the algebraic properties of the current-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions have been collected into a sets of united collection matrices to increase the convergent rate of reducing the conservatism of stabilization conditions. However, there are some limitations existing in the underlying result: (a) some additional equality constraints must be satisfied in [14] and it results in an introduction of conservatism, (b) the underlying result is only parameter-dependent on the current-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions. Therefore, further studies in this area should be investigated with the purpose of overcoming the above two drawbacks.With the rapid development of computer and industrial network technologies, networked control systems (NCS) have drawn much attention due to their great advantages over traditional point-to-point control systems [16]. However, the utilization of NCS has also bring us with some challenges [17]. Indeed, the network-induced delay and data packet dropout are two challenging ones. The issue of NCS analysis/control synthesis with network-induced delay has been well investigated in the last decade and fruitful results have been obtained for T–S networked control systems with time-delays, e.g., H∞ design [18,20,21], guaranteed cost networked control [19], decentralized networked control [23], communication delay distribution dependent networked control [22,24,25], networked cascade control [26], H∞ filtering for nonlinear discrete-time systems subject to quantization and packet dropouts [27], etc. On the other hand, in almost all the above literature, it has been assumed that the communication between the physical plant and controller is in health, i.e., the signals transmitted from the plant always reach the controller without any information losses. However, there is always a nonzero probability that either measurements or control inputs may be lost during the process of transmission [28]. Based on the PDC technique, the problems of networked control with random packet losses were investigated in [29–33], respectively. Recently, the issue of nonlinear networked control design via Type-2 fuzzy model has also been an interesting topic and two important results have been given in [34,35]. To reduce the conservatism in the quadratic framework, both the non-PDC technique and the basis-dependent Lyapunov function were applied in [36]. However, it is difficult to derive LMI-based conditions under the non-PDC and basis-dependent framework, unless additional overdesign is implemented. As an alternative, the authors in [36] proposed a controller design method with the help of the cone complementarity linearization (CCL) algorithm, which inevitably introduced some conservatism as a tradeoff. As far as this problem is considered, how to obtain relaxed stabilization conditions is still very challenging, which motivates us to carry the current study.The main purpose of this paper is to propose relaxed conditions for control synthesis of discrete-time T–S fuzzy control systems under unreliable communication links. More attentions are focused on designing a new fuzzy controllers such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable with less conservatism than the existing one in the literature. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:(1)A novel fuzzy controller, which is homogenous polynomially parameter-dependent on both the current normalized fuzzy weighting functions and the multi-steps-past normalized fuzzy weighting functions, is provided to make much more use of the information of the nonlinear networked systems.In order to overcome the obstacle faced in [36], i.e., it is difficult to derive LMI-based conditions under the non-PDC and basis-dependent framework, a kind of matrix transformation is proposed to act as an efficient tool to convert the underlying problem into solving LMI-based optimization problem. Then, the problem of control synthesis can be derived in terms of LMIs instead of the conservative CCL algorithm.A new kind of slack variable approach is also developed and thus the algebraic properties of these multi-instant normalized fuzzy weighting functions are collected into some augmented matrices. As a result, the conservatism of control synthesis of discrete-time T–S fuzzy control systems under unreliable communication links can be significantly reduced.Notations. Throughout the paper, the notations are fairly standard. In particular,ℤ+denotes the set of positive integers,ℝrepresents the set of real numbers, and n! represents factorial, i.e., n!=n×(n−1)⋯×1 forn∈ℕand one has 0!=1. He(E) is defined as He(E)=E+ETand E−Tstands for(E−1)Tif the matrix E is nonsingular. E(x) and E(x|y) will, respectively, denote expectation of x and expectation of x conditional on y.The control synthesis problem with unreliable communication links is shown in Fig. 1, where its physical plant is described by a T–S fuzzy model, and the unreliable communications include both the uplink (between controller and physical plant) and the downlink (between physical plant and controller). By using the fuzzy modeling approach proposed in [1], a class of discrete-time nonlinear control system can be described by a set of T–S fuzzy rules as follows:Plant Rulei: IF z1(t) isF1i, and z2(t) isF2i, …, and zp(t) isFpi, Thenx(t+1)=Aix(t)+Biu(t),i∈{1,2,…,r}wherex(t)∈ℝn1denotes the system state vector,u(t)∈ℝn2denotes the control input, z(t)=(z1(t), …, zp(t))Tdenotes the vector of fuzzy premise variables.Then, the overall T–S fuzzy model is inferred as:(1)x(t+1)=∑i=1rhi(z(t))(Aix(t)+Biu(t)),where hi(z(t)) represents the ith normalized fuzzy weighting function.Because of the possible data loss in the communication links from both the sensor to the controller and the controller to the actuator, the measurement value of the plant is no longer equivalent to the input value of the controller, and the output value of the controller is no longer equivalent to the input value of the plant. As given in [36], the data loss phenomena can be modeled as follows:(2)x(t+1)=∑i=1rhi(z(t))(Aix(t)+e(t)Biu(t))=∑i=1rhi(z(t))(Aix(t)+(e¯+e˜(t))Biu(t))where {e(t)} is a Bernoulli process withE(e(t))=e¯,E(e˜(t))=0andE(e˜(t)e˜(t))=e¯(1−e¯).Definition 1[[36]] The closed-loop system (2) is said to be stochastically stable in the mean square if, for any initial condition x(0), there exists a finite matrix W>0 such that:(3)E∑j=0∞|x(j)|2|x(0)<xT(0)Wx(0).Proposition 1[[36]]: Consider the fuzzy system in(2). There exists a state feedback controller in the form of PDC such that the closed-loop system in(2)is stochastically stable in the mean square, if there exist matrices X>0 and Mi, i=1, …, r, satisfying−X**AiX+e¯BiMi−X*e¯(1−e¯)BiMi0−X<0,i=1,2,…,r;−2X**(Ai+Aj)X+e¯(BiMj+BjMi)−2X*e¯(1−e¯)(BiMj+BjMi)0−2X<0,1≤i<j≤r.In this paper, some important definitions about homogeneous matrix polynomials are provided here, which are borrowed from [14], and literature therein.The set Δris defined asΔr=α∈ℝr;∑i=1rαi=1;α≥0. Defineα1k1α2k2⋯αrkr,α∈Δr,ki∈ℤ+,i=1,2,…,rare the monomials, k=k1k2⋯kr, andPk∈ℝn×n,∀k∈K(g)belong to matrix-valued coefficients.K(g)represents the set of r-tuples derived by all possible combinations of nonnegative integers ki, i=1, 2, …, r, such that k1+k2+⋯+kr=g. By definition, for r-tuples k and k′, one writes k≥k′ ifki≥ki′,(i=1,…,r). The usual operations of summation, k+k′, and subtraction, k−k′ (whenever k≥k′), are defined componentwise. Fork∈K(g), one definesA(k)=i|ki≥1,i∈{1,…,r}. Moreover, two important definitions for the coefficient π(k) and a r-tupleχi∈K(1)are given as follows:(4)π(k)=(k1!)×⋯×(kr!),χi=0⋯01︸ith0⋯0.For convenience, some abbreviations are applied as follows:hi(t)=hi(z(t)),h(t)=[h1(t),…,hr(t)]T,hk=h1(t)k1h2(t)k2⋯hr(t)kr,hi(t−j)=hi(z(t−j)),h(t−j)=[h1(t−j),h2(t−j),…,hr(t−j)]T,h(t−j)k=h1(t−j)k1h2(t−j)k2⋯hr(t−j)kr.Lemma 1For symmetric matrices P>0 and P+, the inequalityA1TA2TP+00P+A1A2−P<0 is satisfied, if there exists a matrix G such thatP(*)(*)GA1G+GT−P+(*)GA20G+GT−P+>0.Proof 1P(*)(*)GA1G+GT−P+(*)GA20G+GT−P+>0⇒A1TA2TP+00P+A1A2−P<0,P>0is derived by using a multiplication left and right byI−A1−A2Tand its transpose, respectively.Lemma 2By using the above definitions about homogeneous matrix polynomials, the equality(5)always holds.(5)∑fi∈K(di),ti∈A(fi),ji∈A(fi),fi−χti−χji≥0,i∈{1,…,m+1}∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fiE(f1−χt1−χj1)⋯(fm+1−χtm+1−χjm+1)t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1=∑fi∈K(di−2),1≤ti≤r,1≤ji≤r,i∈{1,…,m+1}∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fihti(t−m−1+i)hji(t−m−1+i)×Ef1⋯fm+1t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1,where diare all positive integers with di>2.Proof 2Consider an arbitrary term of the left-hand side of (5) given by(6)∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fiE(f1−χt1−χj1)⋯(fm+1−χtm+1−χjm+1)t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1,wherefi∈K(di),ti∈A(fi),ji∈A(fi),fi−χti−χji≥0,i∈{1,2,…,m+1}.It is easy to see thatfi−χti−χji∈K(di−2), which implies that (6) is one term of the right-hand of (5).On the other hand, consider an arbitrary term of the right-hand side of (5) as follows:(7)∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fihti(t−m−1+i)hji(t−m−1+i)Ef1⋯fm+1t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1,wherefi∈K(di−2),i∈{1,2,…,m+1}.Whilefi∈K(di−2),i∈{1,2,…,m+1}in (7), one hasfi+χti+χji∈K(di).Thus, the term of (7) can be represented as∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fi+χti+χjiE(f1+χt1+χj1−χt1−χj1)⋯(fm+1+χtm+1+χjm+1−χtm+1−χjm+1)t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1Therefore, considering thatfi+χti+χji∈K(di),i∈{1,2,…,m+1}in (7), one can gets that (7) is equivalent to (6), which implies that (7) is also one term of the left-hand side of equality (5).More importantly, all terms are different from each other in the left-hand (right-hand) side of equality (5), so both sides of (5) are the same. Thus, it follows that equality (5) always holds.The novel fuzzy controller and the applied fuzzy Lyapunov function candidate are designed as follows:(8)u(t)=Fg(t−m,t)Gs−1(t−m)x(t),(9)V(x(t))=xT(t)Gs−T(t−m)Ps(t−m)Gs−1(t−m)x(t),where one has:Fg(t−m,t)=∑ki∈K(gi),i∈{1,…,m+1}∏i=1m+1hki(t−m−1+i)Fk1⋯km+1,Gs(t−m)=∑si∈K(si)),i∈{1,…,m}∏i=1mhsi(t−m−1+i)Gs1⋯sm,Ps(t−m)=∑si∈K(si),i∈{1,…,m}∏i=1mhsi(t−m−1+i)Ps1⋯sm.Furthermore,Fk1⋯km+1∈ℝn2×n1,Gs1⋯sm∈ℝn1×n1andPs1⋯sm∈ℝn1×n1are matrices to be solved in the sequel,g1,…,gm+1,s1,…,sm∈ℤ+.Considering (2) and (8), the closed-loop fuzzy control system can be described as follows:(10)x(t+1)=A(h)+(e¯+e˜(t))B(h)Fg(t−m,t)Gs−1(t−m)x(t).Theorem 1For giveng1,…,gm+1∈ℤ+ands1,…,sm∈ℤ+, the closed-loop fuzzy control system(10)is stochastically stable in the mean square, if there exist symmetric matricesPs1⋯sm∈ℝn1×n1(si∈K(si),i∈{1,2,…,m}), matricesFk1⋯km+1∈ℝn2×n1,(ki∈K(gi),i∈{1,2,…,m+1}), andGs1⋯sm∈ℝn1×n1(si∈K(si),i∈{1,2,…,m}), such as the LMIs given by(11)hold in true:(11)ϒf1⋯fm+1>0,∀fi∈K(fi),i∈{1,…,m+1},where f1=max{g1, s1}, fj=max{gj, sj, sj−1}(j∈{2, …, m}), fm+1=max{gm+1+1, sm}, andϒf1⋯fm+1=∑si∈K(si),fi≥si,i∈{1,…,m}ϕf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sm+∑ki∈K(ki),fi≥ki,i∈{1,…,m};fm+1−km+1−χl≥0,l∈{1,2,…,r}φf1⋯fm+1k1⋯km+1l+∑si∈K(si),fi+1≥si,i∈{1,…,m}ψf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sm+∑si∈K(si),fi≥si,i∈{1,…,m};fm+1−χl≥0,l∈{1,2,…,r}ωf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sml,ϕf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sm=∏i=1m(fi−si)!π(fi−si)(fm+1)!π(fm+1)Ps1⋯sm**00*000,φf1⋯fm+1k1⋯km+1l=∏i=1m(fi−gi)!π(fi−ki)(fm+1−1−gm+1)!π(fm+1−km+1−χl)0**e¯BlFk1⋯km+10*e¯(1−e¯)BlFk1⋯km+100,ψf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sm=(f1)!π(f1)∏i=2m(fi−si−1)!π(fi−si−1)(fm+1−sm)!π(fm+1−sm)0**0He(Gs1⋯sm)−Ps1⋯sm*00He(Gs1⋯sm)−Ps1⋯sm,ωf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sml=∏i=1m(fi−si)!π(fi−si)(fm+1−1)!π(fm+1−χl)0**AlGs1⋯sm0*000.Proof 3Along the solution to the closed-loop fuzzy control system (10), one gets:EΔV(x(t))=EV(x(t+1))−V(x(t))=xT(t)ΓTΘΓ−Gs−T(t−m)Ps(t−m)Gs−1(t−m)x(t),whereΓ=Gs−1(t−m+1)00Gs−1(t−m+1)×A(h)+e¯B(h)Fg(t−m,t)Gg−1(t−m)e¯(1−e¯)B(h)Fg(t−m,t)Gg−1(t−m),Θ=Ps(t−m+1)00Ps(t−m+1),Gs(t−m+1)=∑si∈K(si)),i∈{1,…,m}∏i=1mhsi(t−m+i)Gs1⋯sm,Ps(t−m+1)=∑si∈K(si),i∈{1,…,m}∏i=1mhsi(t−m+i)Ps1⋯sm.Then, the inequalityEΔV(x(t))<0always holds if the following inequality is satisfied:(12)ΓTΘΓ−Gs−T(t−m)Ps(t−m)Gs−1(t−m)<0.Multiplying left byGsT(t−m)and right by Gs(t−m) to the above inequality (12), it is easy to verify that (12) could be ensured by the inequality as follows:(13)ΞTΘΞ−Ps(t−m)<0,whereΞ=Gs−1(t−m+1)00Gs−1(t−m+1)×A(h)Gs(t−m)+e¯B(h)Fg(t−m,t)e¯(1−e¯)B(h)Fg(t−m,t).Applying Lemma 1, the inequality (13) holds if the following inequality holds in true:(14)Ps(t−m)**A(h)Gs(t−m)+e¯B(h)Fg(t−m,t)Π22*e¯(1−e¯)B(h)Fg(t−m,t)0Π33>0,whereΠ22=Π33=Gs(t−m+1)+GsT(t−m+1)−Ps(t−m+1).On the other hand, recalling the fact that h1(t−m−1+i)+⋯+hr(t−m−1+i)=1 with i∈{1, …, m+1}, one important equality can be derived as follows:Left(14)=∑fi∈K(fi)i∈{1,…,m+1}∏i=1m+1hfi(t−m−1+i)ϒf1⋯fm+1,where f1=max{g1, s1}, fj=max{gj, sj, sj−1}(j∈{2, …, m}), fm+1=max{gm+1+1, sm}, andϒf1⋯fm+1has been given in (11).LetΦ=ΓTΘΓ−Gs−T(t−m)Ps(t−m)Gs−1(t−m), one gets(15)EV(x(t+1))−V(x(t))≤−λmin(−Φ)xT(t)x(t).Taking mathematical expectation of both sides of (15) and summing up the inequality on both sides from j=0, 1, …, n, one obtains(16)EV(x(n+1))−V(x(0))≤−λmin(−Φ)E∑j=0nxT(j)x(j),which implies(17)E∑j=0nxT(j)x(j)≤λmin(−Φ)−1V(x(0)),where x(0) is the initial condition. When n→∞, consideringEV(x(∞))≥0, one gets(18)E∑j=0∞|x(j)|2|x(0)≤λmin(−Φ)−1V(x(0))=xT(0)Wx(0),whereW=λmin(−Φ)−1∑si∈K(si)i∈{1,…,m}∏i=1mhsi(i−m−1)Ps1⋯sm.From (12), one has Φ<0, and therefore, λmin(−Φ)>0 and W>0. Then, according to Definition 1, it can be concluded that the closed-loop fuzzy control system (10) is stochastically stable in the mean square if LMI-based conditions given by (11) hold in true.Next, a new kind of slack variable approach is developed to further reduce the conservatism of Theorem 1.Theorem 2For giveng1,…,gm+1∈ℤ+,s1,…,sm∈ℤ+, andd1,…,dm+1∈ℤ+, the closed-loop fuzzy control system(10)is stochastically stable in the mean square, if there exist symmetric matricesPs1⋯sm∈ℝn1×n1(si∈K(si),i∈{1,…,m}), matricesFk1⋯km+1∈ℝn2×n1,(ki∈K(gi),i∈{1,…,m+1}),Gs1⋯sm∈ℝn1×n1(si∈K(si),i∈{1,…,m}), andE(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1=E(f1)⋯(fm+1)j1t1⋯jm+1tm+1T∈ℝ3n1×3n1(fi∈K(fi+di−2),i∈{1,…,m+1}), such as the LMIs given by(19) and (20)hold in true.(19)Γf1⋯fm+1+∑ti∈A(fi),ji∈A(fi),fi−χti−χji≥0,i=∈{1,…,m+1}E(f1−χt1−χj1)⋯(fm+1−χtm+1−χjm+1)t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1>0,(20)∀fi∈K(fi+di),i∈{1,…,m+1};E(f1)⋯(fm+1)(m+1)×(m+1)<0,∀fi∈K(fi+di−2),i∈{1,…,m+1};where f1=max{g1, s1}, fj=max{gj, sj, sj−1}(j∈{2, …, m}), fm+1=max{gm+1+1, sm}, andΓf1⋯fm+1=∑si∈K(si),fi≥si,i∈{1,…,m}ϕf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sm+∑ki∈K(ki),fi≥ki,i∈{1,…,m};fm+1−km+1−χl≥0,l∈{1,2,…,r}φf1⋯fm+1k1⋯km+1l+∑si∈K(si),fi+1≥si,i∈{1,…,m}ψf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sm+∑si∈K(si),fi≥si,i∈{1,…,m};fm+1−χl≥0,l∈{1,2,…,r}ωf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sml,ϕf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sm=∏i=1m(fi+di−si)!π(fi−si)(fm+1+dm+1)!π(fm+1)Ps1⋯sm**00*000,φf1⋯fm+1k1⋯km+1l=∏i=1m(fi+di−gi)!π(fi−ki)(fm+1+dm+1−1−gm+1)!π(fm+1−km+1−χl)0**e¯BlFk1⋯km+10*e¯(1−e¯)BlFk1⋯km+100,ψf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sm=(f1+d1)!π(f1)∏i=2m(fi+di−si−1)!π(fi−si−1)(fm+1+dm+1−sm)!π(fm+1−sm)×0**0He(Gs1⋯sm)−Ps1⋯sm*00He(Gs1⋯sm)−Ps1⋯sm,ωf1⋯fm+1s1⋯sml=∏i=1m(fi+di−si)!π(fi−si)(fm+1+dm+1−1)!π(fm+1−χl)0**AlGs1⋯sm0*000,E(f1)⋯(fm+1)(m+1)×(m+1)=E(f1)⋯(fm+1)11(m)×(m)⋯E(f1)⋯(fm+1)1r(m)×(m)⋮⋱⋮E(f1)⋯(fm+1)r1(m)×(m)⋯E(f1)⋯(fm+1)rr(m)×(m),E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tiji(m−i+1)×(m−i+1)=E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tiji11(m−i)×(m−i)⋯E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tiji1r(m−i)×(m−i)⋮⋱⋮E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tijir1(m−i)×(m−i)⋯E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tijirr(m−i)×(m−i),i=1, 2, …, m−1;E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tmjm(1)×(1)=E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tmjm11⋯E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tmjm1r⋮⋱⋮E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tmjmr1⋯E(f1)⋯(fm+1)t1j1⋯tmjmrr.Recalling the expression of (14), one getsLeft(14)=∑fi∈K(fi+di)i∈{1,…,m+1}∏i=1m+1hfi(t−m−1+i)Γf1⋯fm+1, where f1=max{g1, s1}, fj=max{gj, sj, sj−1}(j∈{2, …, m}), fm+1=max{gm+1+1, sm}, andΓf1⋯fm+1has been given in (19).Pre- and post-multiplying (20) by ((h(t−m)⊗⋯(h(t−1)⊗h)⊗I)Tand its transpose, respectively, one obtains(21)∑1≤ti≤r,1≤ji≤r,i∈{1,…,m+1}∏i=1m+1hti(t−m−1+i)hji(t−m−1+i)Ef1⋯fm+1t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1<0,wherefi∈K(fi+di−2),i∈{1,…,m+1}.Multiplying (19) by∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fiwithfi∈K(fi+di),i∈{1,…,m+1}, it follows that(22)∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fiΓf1⋯fm+1+∑ti∈A(fi),ji∈A(fi),fi−χti−χji≥0,i∈{1,…,m+1}∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fiE(f1−χt1−χj1)⋯(fm+1−χtm+1−χjm+1)t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1>0.By summing all possible inequalities which satisfy (22), one obtains by using Lemma 2:(23)Left(14)+∑fi∈K(fi+di),ti∈A(fi),ji∈A(fi),fi−χti−χji≥0,i∈{1,…,m+1}∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fi×E(f1−χt1−χj1)⋯(fm+1−χtm+1−χjm+1)t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1=∑fi∈K(fi+di−2),1≤ti≤r,1≤ji≤r,i∈{1,…,m+1}∏i=1m+1h(t−m−1+i)fihti(t−m−1+i)hji(t−m−1+i)×Ef1⋯fm+1t1j1⋯tm+1jm+1+Left(14)>0.Then, combining (21) and (23), one obtains that Left(14)>0, i.e., the closed-loop fuzzy control system is stochastically stable in the mean square if LMI-based conditions given by (19)-(20) are satisfied.Example 1An inverted pendulum on a cart shown in Fig. 2is a classical example of an underactuated mechanical system and its stabilization problem has been investigated by many researchers, e.g., [11]. The physical model of the inverted pendulum on a cart is shown in Fig. 3as [11]. Obviously, the upward equilibrium of the pendulum is an unstable state of this system. In this example, the inverted pendulum on a cart with networked u(t) under unreliable communication Links is considered. The parameters of the inverted pendulum are presented as follows: M is mass of the cart, m is mass of the block on the pendulum, l is length of the pendulum, g is acceleration due to gravity, cris coefficient of the damper, θ(t) is angle the pendulum makes with vertical, y(t) is displacement of the cart, u(t) is applied force. By using the Newton's law, one obtains that the motion of the system can be described as follows:Md2ydt2+md2dt2(y(t)+lsinθ(t))=Fϖ(t)−Fr(t)+u(t)md2dt2(y(t)+lsinθ(t))lcosθ(t)=mglsinθ(t)whereFr(t)=cry˙(t)is the resultant force of the damper, Fϖ(t) the position-dependent stochastic perturbation, which is caused by the rough road. In this experiment, the condition of road is smooth and thus Fϖ(t)=0. With the choice of the state variables as:x1(t)=y(t),x2(t)=θ(t),x3(t)=y˙(t),x4(t)=θ˙(t), the state-space equations of the system arex˙1(t)=x3(t),x˙2(t)=x4(t),x˙3(t)=−mgsinx2(t)Mcosx2(t)−crx3(t))−u(t)M,x˙4(t)=(M+m)gsinx2(t)Mlcos2x2(t)+x42sinx2(t)cosx2(t)+crx3(t)−u(t)Mlcosx2(t).Then, like in [11], employing the Euler first-order approximation, one can derive a discrete-time T–S fuzzy model in terms of (1) with the following system parameters.A1=10T0010T0−TmgM1−TcrM00T(M+m)gMlTcrMl1,B1=00TM−TMl,A2=10T0010T0−TmgβM1−TcrM00T(M+m)gβMlα2TcrαMl1,B2=00TM−TMlα, and α=cos(γ) and β=sin(γ)/γ with (0<|γ|<90∘), T is the sampling time.h1(x2(t))=1−x2(t)|γ|andh1(x2(t))=x2(t)|γ|.To simulate this model, one sets M=1.378kg, m=0.051kg, l=0.325m, g=9.8m/s2, cr=5.98kg/s, T=0.025s, and γ=30°.Firstly, the communication link parametere¯is selected as 0.85. Then, with Proposition 1[36], Theorem 1 with (g1=s1=1, g2=2) and Theorem 2 with (g1=s1=1, g2=2, d1=1, d2=2) being applied, three pairs of feasible control gain matrices are obtained, respectively. The comparison results on control performance are implemented, i.e., with the same system parameters and initial condition x(0)=[0 10 15 −40]T, the responses of the control inputs via different control law are compared with each other. The criterion is selected as a performance index function as:J(t)=∫0tuT(s)u(s)ds. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4, one can find that Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 of this paper have provided two less conservative results than the existing counterpart one of [36]. Moreover, Theorem 2 of this paper has provided the best result. This fact has indicated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed results.Secondly, fore¯=0.80, it can be found that neither the approach given by Proposition 1[36] or the approach given by Th. 1 of this paper provides any feasible solution. Then, by applying Th. 2 of this paper, the control gain matrices of the proposed fuzzy controller (8) can be calculated by solving (19) and (20):G10=10−4×0.4624−0.0094−0.1542−0.0166−0.00750.0520−0.1001−0.0712−0.1838−0.08610.6008−0.10120.0522−0.1131−0.18250.7783,G01=10−4×0.4628−0.0095−0.1571−0.0121−0.00750.0520−0.0977−0.0736−0.1844−0.08590.6189−0.12850.0528−0.1131−0.23350.8454,F1020=10−3×−0.11540.0294−0.19460.9990,F1011=−0.00020.0001−0.00020.0017,F1002=10−3×−0.11640.0386−0.08170.7821,F0120=−0.00010.0000−0.00030.0011,F0111=−0.00020.0001−0.00030.0018,F0102=10−3×−0.11590.0388−0.13270.8483.By setting the initial condition as x(0)=[0 10 15 −40]Tand using the above control gain matricesGs1andFk1k2, the resultant trajectories of both x1(t) and x2(t) are shown in Fig. 5. Under the control of the obtained fuzzy controller (8), Fig. 5 has depicted that the closed-loop control system is stochastically stable in the mean square.Example 2Consider a discrete-time nonlinear control system which is represented as follows:(24)x1(t+1)=x1(t)−x1(t)x2(t)+(5+x1(t))u(t),x2(t+1)=−x1(t)−0.5x2(t)+2x1(t)u(t).If the normalized fuzzy weighting functions are designed as:h1(z(t))=F11(x1(t))=(β+x1(t))/2β,h2(z(t))=F12(x1(t))=(β−x1(t))/2β, one can derive thatx1(t)=βF11(x1(t))−βF12(x1(t))with β>0 and x1(t)∈[−β, β]. As a result, the nonlinear model (24) can be described by two rules of discrete-time T–S fuzzy model as follows:x(t+1)=∑i=12hi(z(t))Aix(t)+Biu(t),whereA1=1−β−1−0.5,A2=1β−1−0.5,B1=5+β2β,B2=5−β−2β.In this numerical experiment, the communication link parametere¯is selected as 0.9. The data missing is randomly generated according the probability shown in Fig. 6. Then, with Proposition 1[36], Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 of this paper being applied, the feasible values of β are calculated by using three different methods are applied, respectively. In particular, Th. 1 denotes Theorem 1 with (g1=1, g2=2, s1=1) of this paper, and Th. 2 denotes Theorem 2 with (g1=s1=1, g2=2, d1=1, d2=2) of this paper. The obtained results are listed in Table 1. From Table 1, one can obtain that both Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 of this paper have provided less conservative results than the existing counterpart one of [36]. Indeed, Theorem 2 of this paper has provided the least result among the three approaches. This fact has indicated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.Next, for β=1.461, it can be noted from Table 1 that neither the approach given by Proposition 1[36] or the approach given by Th. 1 of this paper provides any feasible solution. Then, by applying Th. 2 of this paper, the control gain matrices of the proposed fuzzy controller (8) can be calculated by solving (19) and (20):G10=0.17650.01920.01900.4936G01=0.21850.05990.05940.4378F1020=−0.02010.1040,F1011=−0.06890.0360F1002=−0.0579−0.1758F0120=−0.01690.0840F0111=−0.07790.0148F0102=−0.0830−0.1696.By setting the initial condition as x(0)=[1.461, 2.490]Tand using the above control gain matricesGs1andFk1k2, the resultant trajectories of both x1(t) and x2(t) are shown in Fig. 7. Under the control of the obtained fuzzy controller (8), Fig. 7 has depicted that the closed-loop control system is stochastically stable in the mean square.
