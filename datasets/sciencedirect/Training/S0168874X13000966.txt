@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this article we present a novel application of the moving grid finite element method [1] for solving a cytomechanical model that describes actin dynamics in order to generate cell movement and deformation. The cytomechanical model describes both the mechanical and biochemical properties of the cortical network of actin filaments and its concentration. Actin is a polymer that can exist either in filamentous form (F-actin) or in monometric form (G-actin) [2] and the filamentous form is arranged in a paired helix of two protofilaments [3]. By assuming slow deformations of the cell, we validate numerical results by comparing qualitatively with predictions from linear stability theory close to bifurcation points. Far from bifurcation points, the mathematical model and computational algorithm are able to describe and generate the complex cell deformations typically observed in experiments. Our numerical results illustrate cell expansion, cell contraction, cell translation and cell relocation as well as cell protrusions. A key model bifurcation parameter identified is the contractile tonicity formed by the association of actin filaments to the myosin II motor proteins. The robustness, generality and applicability of the numerical methodology allows us to tackle similar problems in developmental biology, biomedicine and plant biology where similar mechanisms are routinely used.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The migratory behavior of cells plays a crucial role in many biological events (e.g. physiological and pathological process [4]) such as immune response [5–7], wound healing, development of tissues [8], embryogenesis [9,10], inflammation and the formation of tumor metastasis [7,11]. According to experimental observations, actin plays an important role in cell movement and deformation. Actin is a polymer that can exist in two forms; in monomeric form as G-actin or in polymeric form (i.e. in filamentous form) as F-actin [12]. The mechanical properties of actin network and the biochemical dynamics of actin (i.e. the concentration of F-actin, its random movement via diffusion, convective and dilution effects due to shape movement and its kinetics of polymerization and de-polymerization from F-actin to G-actin) inside the cell play an active role in cell movement and deformation [12–15].In order to describe the dynamics of movements and changes in cell geometry of a eukaryotic cell we will consider a cytomechanical model that is derived based on the actin dynamics. The model is highly complex and consist of a system of nonlinear equations defined on a complex evolving geometry representing the cell. We propose to apply a novel numerical method: the moving grid finite element method (MGFEM) [1,17] to compute numerical approximate solutions of the cytomechanical model. A determining factor in choosing a numerical method is usually the ease in which a method can be applied to a problem at hand and the ability of the method to produce highly accurate solutions in comparison with other available methods. The key factors being accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the numerical method Bindu [16,17,20,25].To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first to present the use of finite elements to solve the cytomechanical model system. To-date, numerical approximation of the cytomechanical model has been done by Alt and Tranquillo [15] and Stéphanou et al. [12] based on finite differences. Rather than working in the original cartesian coordinates, the authors transform the model system into a polar coordinate system which makes it difficulty to describe the evolution of a cell as it moves outside the origin of the polar coordinate system. The cell is not able to move or deform away from the origin [12]. The origin remains a fixed point, the cell is only able to deform along the boundary but is not able to move freely on the substrate as is observed in experiments [12]. In order to remedy this drawback, we propose to employ the MGFEM thereby enabling us to simulate accurately cell movement and deformation in complete agreement with experimental observations. Other alternative methods that could be used to overcome difficulties in solving the cytomechanical model using [18,19] finite differences include (but are not limited to) boundary element methods (BEM) [22,23] and level set methods (LSM) [24]. Since the cytomechanical model is a second order inhomogeneous and nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the application of the BEM is much more difficult compared to FEM [26]. The LSM will not be implemented here but could be implemented in the future by coupling the method to the MGFEM in order to facilitate modeling splitting and reconnecting cells. In this article, we choose to implement a finite element formulation by employing the MGFEM [1,17,29] for two advantageous reasons: (i) the MGFEM solves the model equations in their physical cartesian coordinates without the need for transformations or mappings and (ii) the MGFEM easily handles complex and evolving cellular domains. As a result, the cell is able to move and deform freely on the substrate in complete agreement with experimental observations.In view of these key advantages, we develop a MGFEM of the cytomechanical model that is defined on a two-dimensional (2D) cartesian coordinate system. The MGFEM is a novel extension of the finite element method to moving boundary problems introduced by Madzvamuse [27] to study partial differential equations posed on complex evolving domains. The essential component underlying the MGFEM is that the object function is represented by piecewise basis functions on a finite element mesh in which the nodal positions vary with time [1,17,29]. It is a highly accurate, efficient and robust numerical method which has been used successfully to compute numerical solutions of reaction–diffusion systems on evolving and continuously deforming domains with complex geometries (see [1,17,21,28] for details). The novelty of the MGFEM is its ability to allow the prescription of the nodal displacement of the computational grid points of the finite element mesh during the evolution of the domain. It is able to accommodate a priori description of the grid displacement [27], a computed grid displacement (which are solutions of a partial differential equation of an unknown variable) or a grid displacement generated by minimizing the residual of the differential equation [29,30] (as developed by [30] in the moving finite element). The difference between the moving finite element and MGFEM is the derivation of the grid displacement [21].Therefore, this article is structured as follows: In Section 2 we present the cytomechanical model. In Section 3 we derive the weak formulation for the cytomechanical model and then present the finite element discretization of the model system. We also describe the method of computation of the domain evolution and the techniques of implementation of the MGFEM. Since the cytomechanical model is a highly complex nonlinear system of partial differential equations, analytical solutions in closed form can not be derived. To this end, it is difficult to compare numerical solutions to exact analytical solutions. Therefore, in order to validate numerical results, we call upon linear stability theory and show that close to bifurcation points, the numerical method computes solutions in close agreement with those predicted by linear theory. Details of linear stability theory are presented in Appendix B. Linear theory also provides us with plausible ranges for the parameter values. Once validated, numerical results obtained from the implementation of the MGFEM are shown in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we conclude and discuss future research strands.Following George et al. [31], letΩt⊂R2be a simply connected bounded continuously deforming domain representing the Eukaryotic cell shape at timet∈I=[0,Tf],Tf>0and∂Ωtbe the boundary describing the cell. At any given point,x=(x(t),y(t))∈Ωt⊂R2, leta=a(x(t),t)be the F-actin concentration andu=(u(x(t),t),v(x(t),t))Tbe a vector of displacement of the elements of the actin network at positionx∈Ωtat timet∈I. As a result of cell movement we defineβto represent the flow velocity of the elements of the actin network andωnthe normal velocity of the boundary. Furthermore denoten=(n1,n2)the outward unit vector normal to the boundary. We note that by defininguto be a vector of displacement of the elements of the actin network at positionx∈Ωtat timet∈I, the following system of equations describing the actin dynamics as given by Stéphanou et al. [12] models both plasticity and viscoelasticity of the actin network: for allt∈I,(2.1a)∇·(σv+σe+σc+σp)=0inΩt,(2.1b)∂a∂t−DaΔa+∇·(aβ)−ka(ac−a)=0inΩt,(2.1c)u(x(t),t)=0∀x∈Ω0,(2.1d)a(x(t),t)=a0∀x∈Ω0,(2.1e)β=ωn∀x∈∂Ωt,(2.1f)(σv+σe)·n=n·∇a=0∀x∈∂Ωt,whereΩ0is the initial cell domain at time t=0. In (2.1a),σv,σe,σcandσpare the viscous, elastic, contractile and pressure component stress tensors. These are defined as(2.2){σc=σ(a)I=ψa2e−a/asatI,σv=μ1∂ϵ∂t+μ2∂ϕ∂tI,σe=E1+ν(ϵ+ν1−2νϕI),σp=p1+ϕ(1+2πδ(l)arctana)I,whereϵ=12(∇u+∇uT)represents the strain tensor,Iis the identity tensor,ϕ=∇·uis the dilation, andμ1andμ2are the shear and bulk viscosities of the actin network respectively. Finally E andνare the Young's modulus and Poisson ratio respectively. The functionσ(a)represents the contractile activity of the actomyosin network [31]. In the above formulation,2asatrepresents the saturation concentration of F-actin. In order to describe the pressure forcesσpacting within the cell we make the following assumptions. We assume that the initial domain is a unit disk which we denote asΩ0and that there exists a family of bijective mappings that maps the pointsξ=(ξx,ξy)of the initial domain to pointxon the current domainΩt. Letl:Ωt×I→Rand it's corresponding function on the initial domain bel^:Ω0×I→[0,1]wherel^(ξ,t)is the distance between the centroid and the pointξin the initial domain withl^(ξ,t)=l(x(ξ,t),t). The functionp(a)≔p/1+ϕ(1+(2/π)δ(l)arctana)describes the pressure force in different regions governed by the heavy-side function:(2.3)δ(l)={1ifthepoint(x,t)withl(x(ξ,t),t)=l^(ξ,t)issuchthatthedistanceξx2+ξy2>0.8intheinitialdomain,0elsewhere.This signifies that far from the membrane, only the osmotic componentp/(1+ϕ)of the pressure force exists within the network and depends on the dilationϕ. In the vicinity of the membrane (i.e. whereξx2+ξy2>0.8), a polymerization-induced pressure which depends on the local actin density reinforces the osmotic stress and pushes the membrane out at regions where the filaments are not firmly linked to the membrane [31].δ(l)is used here to specify the differences in pressure in the cell at the vicinity of the membrane and further away from it. We have assumed that the polymerization of actin, which happens predominately at the vicinity of the membrane, induces a pressure that reinforces the osmotic pressure at the vicinity of the membrane. Eq. (2.1b) describes the conservation of F-actin within the cell. It describes the concentration of F-actin, its random movement via diffusion, convective and dilution effects due to the movement of the cell and its kinetics of polymerization and depolymerization.In (2.1b), acis a constant parameter representing the F-actin concentration at the chemical equilibrium. It differentiates the states of polymerization and depolymerization. The polymerization rate is given by kaand Dais a positive diffusion coefficient for F-actin. The reaction kineticska(ac−a), models the actin dynamics of polymerization and depolymerization. The actin polymerization and depolymerization are considered to occur at the same rate ka. Thus the state of polymerization or depolymerization depends on the local value of F-actin concentration relative to the concentration at the chemical equilibrium ac[55]. On the boundary, we take the flow velocity of the actin networkβ=ωn≔∂u/∂t. Hereuis the displacement of the actin network at any given point in space and is computed as the displacement solution obtained from the force balance equation (2.1a). In the interior of the domain, we assume thatβ=∂x/∂t≔∂u/∂twhere∂x/∂tis the mesh velocity. Thus we have a Lagrangian description of the domain evolution.For initial conditions, we define the initial domainΩ0, t=0, to be a unit disk. We prescribe the initial conditions for F-actin density a0 to correspond to random small perturbations around the homogeneous steady state of the cell. This state biologically corresponds to the cell condition right after mitosis (i.e. cell division) with the cell having a perfectly circular shape. The steady state of F-actin is assumed to occur as a result of an equilibrium in the kinetics of polymerization/depolymerization of actin within the cell and there is no flux of actin from the exterior. We assume that at the initial time, the cell is unstrained from its original position. The boundary conditions in (2.1f) specify a zero flux boundary for the reaction–diffusion equation (2.1b) and a stress free boundary for the force balance equation (2.1a).Remark 2.1We note that in a previous work by Stéphanou et al. [12], the displacementu(x(t),t)was taken to be the displacement of the elements of the actin network from the original unstrained position. In this work, we compute the displacementu(x(t),t)continuously given the previous positions ofx∈Ωt, at timet∈I. An advantage of this modification is that the cell is no longer rigid but can translate, expand and contract.Model parameter values are chosen close to those available in the literature. For example, in Stéphanou et al. [12], a diffusion coefficient Dain the range0.00962–0.134cm2/sand an actin saturation concentration asatof 1.1 normalized density were used. Viscosity of Fibroblast cells is given in Bausch et al. [32] to be 200dyn/cm2. Here we choose the value of the shear viscosity to be96.15dynscm2and the value of the bulk viscosity of the actin networkμ2=250dyns/cm2to be larger than that of the shear modulus. This is because F-actin are more resistant to compression than shear [33]. The rest of the dimensional model parameter values are shown in Table 1. It must be noted that we have not assigned parameter values for pressure coefficient p and the contractile coefficientψ, these will be determined mathematically by use of linear stability as illustrated in Appendix B.The essential component underlying the moving grid finite element method (MGFEM) is that the object function is represented by piecewise basis functions on a finite element mesh in which the nodal positions vary with time [1,17,29]. The way in which these nodes are moved and how the solution evolves is derived in the weak form of the model system. Unlike previous studies [1,17] where the nodal movement was provided by a separate definition, here nodal movement is an unknown quantity to be computed simultaneously with the actin concentrations. The MGFEM is an extension of the finite element method to moving boundary problems. Thus from Sections 3.1–3.80, we describe the finite element discretization of the coupled system (2.1) defined on a moving cell and in Section 3.9, we present the method for the cell domain evolution. We note that the MGFEM applied to reaction–diffusion equations has already been established [21] but this is not the case for the force balance equation. Our aim is to present in detail the MGFEM applied to the cytomechanical model by deriving a MGFEM of the force balance equation and then couple it to that of the reaction–diffusion equation.Reynolds transport theorem. Here we state the Reynolds transport theorem. This theorem shall be useful in the derivation of the weak formulation for the reaction–diffusion equation.Theorem 3.1Reynolds transport theoremLetg(x,t)be a scalar function defined onΩtandβbe a flow velocity field then(3.1)ddt∫ΩtgdΩt=∫Ωt(DgDt+g∇·β)dΩtA proof of this theorem can be found in[27].To proceed, we decouple the force balance equation into a system of two partial differential equations for ease of implementation of the weak formulation. We substitute the values ofσv,σe,σcandσpas defined in (2.2) into the force balance equation (2.1a). This necessitates the expression of the stress tensors in tensor-matrix forms. It follows that the dilationϕby definition isϕ≔∇·u=∂u/∂x+∂v/∂yand the stain tensorϵisϵ(u)=12(∇u+(∇u)T)=(∂u∂x12(∂v∂x+∂u∂y)12(∂v∂x+∂u∂y)∂v∂y)∈R2×2.By using the above representation of the strain tensorϵand the dilationϕ, we represent the stress tensorsσc,σp,σeandσv(defined in (2.2)) in two-dimensional tensor-matrix forms as members ofR2×2as follows:σc=(ψa2e−a/asat00ψa2e−a/asat),σv=((μ1+μ2)∂u̇∂x+μ2∂v̇∂yμ12(∂v̇∂x+∂u̇∂y)μ12(∂v̇∂x+∂u̇∂y)μ2∂u̇∂x+(μ1+μ2)∂v̇∂y),σe=E′2((ν′+2)∂u∂x+ν′∂v∂y∂v∂x+∂u∂y∂v∂x+∂u∂yν′∂u∂x+(ν′+2)∂v∂y),andσp=(p1+ϕ(1+2πδ(l)arctana)00p1+ϕ(1+2πδ(l)arctana)).Substituting the matrix tensor representation of the stress tensors into (2.1a) we obtain the force balance equation in matrix tensor form which is then decoupled into a system of two equations. The decoupled system of differential equations of the force balance equation is thus(3.2a)∂∂x(D11∂u̇∂x+D12∂v̇∂y)+∂∂y[D33(∂u̇∂y+∂v̇∂x)]+∂∂x(C11∂u∂x+C12∂v∂y)+∂∂y[C33(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)]=−∂f1∂x,and(3.2b)∂∂x[D33(∂u̇∂y+∂v̇∂x)]+∂∂y(D12∂u̇∂x+D22∂v̇∂y)+∂∂y(C12∂u∂x+C22∂v∂y)+∂∂x[C33(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)]=−∂f2∂y,wheref1≡f2=[p1+ϕ(1+2πδ(l)arctana]+ψa2e−a/asat),D11=D22=μ1+μ2,D12≡D21=μ2,D33=μ1/2,C11≡C22=E(1−ν)(1+ν)(1−2ν),C12≡C21=Eν(1+ν)(1−2ν),andC33=E2(1+ν).To derive the weak formulation of the force balance equation, we multiply the system of partial differential Eqs. (3.2a) and (3.2b) by the test functionsw1(x,t)andw2(x,t)∈H1(Ωt), t∈Irespectively, and using Green's formula [34] we integrate the partial differential equations over the domainΩtand apply the boundary condition (2.1f). We note that the boundary condition (2.1f) implies that the boundary term vanishes after carrying out the integration over the domain. The weak formulation is thus: Findu(x,t),v(x,t)∈H1(Ωt),t∈Isuch that(3.3a)∫Ωt∂w1∂x(D11∂u̇∂x+D12∂v̇∂y+C11∂u∂x+C12∂v∂y)+∂w1∂y[D33(∂u̇∂y+∂v̇∂x)]+∂w1∂y[C33(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)]dΩt=∫Ωtw1∂f1∂xdΩt,and(3.3b)∫Ωt∂w2∂y(D12∂u̇∂x+D22∂v̇∂y+C12∂u∂x+C22∂v∂y)+∂w2∂x[D33(∂u̇∂y+∂v̇∂x)]+∂w2∂x[C33(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)]dΩt=∫Ωtw2∂f2∂ydΩt,for allw1(x,t),w2(x,t)∈H1(Ωt),t∈I. The integrals on the right hand side of the weak formulation (3.3) are difficult to evaluate. To show this we write them out explicitly as(3.4){∫Ωtw1∂f1∂xdΩt=∫Ωtw1∂∂x[p1+ϕ(1+2πδ(l)arctana)]dΩt+∫Ωtw1∂∂x(ψa2e−a/asat)dΩt,∫Ωtw2∂f2∂ydΩt=∫Ωtw2∂∂y[p1+ϕ(1+2πδ(l)arctana)]dΩt+∫Ωtw2∂∂y(ψa2e−a/asat)dΩt,sincef1≡f2=p/1+ϕ(1+(2/π)δ(l)arctana)+ψa2e−a/asat. In view of this, we state the following identities which can be derived using the gradient and divergence theorems and are useful in the sequel in rewriting the weak form in a computationally efficient form. Letr(x,t)andg(x,t)be scalar functions of classC0(Ωt)defined inΩt⊂R2and also letn=(n1,n2)denote the outward unit vector normal to∂Ωtfor timet∈I. Then the following identities (derived from the gradient theorem) hold [16]:(3.5){∫Ωtr∂g∂xdΩt=−∫Ωtg∂r∂xdΩt+∫∂Ωtn1rgds,∫Ωtr∂g∂ydΩt=−∫Ωtg∂r∂ydΩt+∫∂Ωtn2rgds,where ds is the element of arclength. Using the identities (3.5) we can rewrite the weak form as follows: Findu(x,t),v(x,t)∈H1(Ωt),t∈Isuch that(3.6a)∫Ωt∂w1∂x(D11∂u̇∂x+D12∂v̇∂y+C11∂u∂x+C12∂v∂y)+∂w1∂y[D33(∂u̇∂y+∂v̇∂x)]+∂w1∂y[C33(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)]dΩt=−∫Ωtf1∂w1∂xdΩt+∫∂Ωtn1f1w1ds,and(3.6b)∫Ωt∂w2∂y(D12∂u̇∂x+D22∂v̇∂y+C12∂u∂x+C22∂v∂y)+∂w2∂x[D33(∂u̇∂y+∂v̇∂x)]+∂w2∂x[C33(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)]dΩt=−∫Ωtf2∂w2∂ydΩt+∫∂Ωtn2f2w2ds,for allw1(x,t),w2(x,t)∈H1(Ωt),t∈I. Here n1 and n2 are the direction cosines of the outward unit vector,nnormal to∂Ωtfor timet∈I. The test functions we use are piecewise linear basis functions and their spatial derivatives are easy and straight forward to compute, the weak formulation as expressed in (3.6) is a lot easier to compute compared to (3.3). We say thatu(x,t),v(x,t)are weak solutions of the force balance equation (2.1a) ifu(x,t),v(x,t)∈H1(Ωt)and (3.11) holds. Here we have assumed thata(x,t)is known and is the solution of the reaction–diffusion equation (2.1b).Remark 3.1We would like to note that we do not actually compute the derivatives of the delta function but we transfer these derivatives to the test function by using identities (3.5).We first re-write the reaction–diffusion equation for the actin biochemical dynamics in the following amenable form(3.7)DaDt−DaΔa+a(∇·β)−ka(ac−a)=0whereDaDt=∂a∂t+(∇a)·βdenotes the material derivative of the actin concentration a.To obtain the weak formulation we multiply (3.7) by a test functionw3(x,t)∈H1(Ωt),t∈I, then we integrate by parts and apply the boundary conditions (see (2.1f)):(3.8)∫Ωt[w3Da∂t+aw3(∇·β)+Da∇a·∇w3+kaaw3]dΩt=∫Ωtkaacw3dΩt.Using the product rule, the differential equation (3.8) can be rewritten as(3.9)∫Ωt[D(aw3)∂t−aDw3∂t+aw3(∇·β)+Da∇a·∇w3]dΩt+∫Ωtkaaw3dΩt=∫Ωtkaacw3dΩt.Using the Reynolds transport theorem [35], we rewrite (3.9) such that the weak formulation reads: Finda(x,t)∈H1(Ωt),t∈Isuch that(3.10)ddt∫Ωtaw3dΩt+∫Ωt(Da∇a·∇w3+kaaw3)dΩt=∫Ωtkaacw3dΩt+∫ΩtaDw3DtdΩt,∀w3∈H1(Ωt).The weak formulation of the coupled problem (2.1) is thus: finda(x,t),u(x,t),v(x,t)∈H1(Ωt),t∈Isuch that(3.11a)∫Ωt∂w1∂x(D11∂u̇∂x+D12∂v̇∂y+C11∂u∂x+C12∂v∂y)+∂w1∂y[D33(∂u̇∂y+∂v̇∂x)]+∂w1∂y[C33(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)]dΩt=−∫Ωtf1∂w1∂xdΩt+∫∂Ωtn1f1wds,(3.11b)∫Ωt∂w2∂y(D12∂u̇∂x+D22∂v̇∂y+C12∂u∂x+C22∂v∂y)+∂w2∂x[D33(∂u̇∂y+∂v̇∂x)]+∂w2∂x[C33(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)]dΩt=−∫Ωtf2∂w2∂ydΩt+∫∂Ωtn2f2w2ds,and(3.11c)ddt∫Ωtaw3dΩt+∫Ωt(Da∇a·∇w3+kaaw3)dΩt=∫Ωtkaacw3dΩt+∫ΩtaDw3DtdΩt,for allw1(x,t),w2(x,t),w3(x,t)∈H1(Ωt),t∈I.LetΩh,t,t∈Ibe a bounded domain triangulated byTh,t. Each triangular partition is known as an element S. We use barycentric coordinates as the local coordinate system on the elements of the triangulation. LetP¯1be a finite dimensional function space defined onS¯, whereS¯is a reference element:S¯≔{(λ0,…,λ2)∈R3;0≤λk≤1,∑k=13λk=1}then there exist a one-to-one mapping fromS¯to S. Also let{x1(t),x2(t),x3(t)}denote the vertices of the element S. Then the following parameterization using barycentric coordinates over the element S can be defined [36],(3.12)x(λ1,λ2,λ3,t)=∑k=13λkxk(t).Letw(x(t)):Ω→R,t∈I, be a finite element function on an element S defined by a finite dimensional function spaceP¯1defined on a reference elementS¯and the mappingλSfrom the reference elementS¯to S such thatw(x(t))=w¯(λS(x(t))), wherew¯is defined on S. We define the spaceXh(t)⊂H1(Ωt):Xh(t)={w∈C0(Ωt)∩H1(Ωt);w¯∈P¯1forallS∈Th,t,t∈I}.First let us approximate the continuously evolving cell domain with a finite polygonal domain as follows: at each time t,t∈I, we discretizeΩtinto a finite unstructured triangular partitionΩh,tof non-overlapping triangles, where h is the maximum size of the largest triangle. Each triangular partition is known as an element S and the set of these finite triangular elements is called a mesh and we denote this mesh byTh,t. For the finite element mesh we require that no vertex of any element lie on the interior of a side of another element andSi∩Sj=∅ifi≠j. ThusΩ¯h,t=⋃S(t)∈Th,tS(t).We assume that the triangulationTh,tfor allt∈Iis shape regular.Definition 3.1Shape regularity (Johnson [37])LethS=bethe longest side of S (otherwise known as the diameter of S),ρSthe diameter of the circle inscribed in S andh=maxS∈Th,thS.A triangulationTh,tis shape regular if there exist a positive constantζindependent of h such that(3.13)ρShS≥ζ∀S∈Th,t,t∈I.The constantζis a measure of the minimum angle in anyS∈Th,t,t∈I. The regularity condition (3.13) specifies that the elements S are not allowed to be arbitrary thin.We note that all angles of the triangular elements stay away from 180° and are thus shape-consistent. Next, we discretize the problem (3.11) using the classical Galerkin method. The discretized problem of the coupled system(PS) of (3.11) reads: findah(x,t),uh(x,t),vh(x,t)∈Xh(t),t∈Isuch that(3.14a)∫Ωh,t∂wh1∂x(D11∂u̇h∂x+D12∂v̇h∂y+C11∂uh∂x+C12∂vh∂y)+∂wh1∂y[D33(∂u̇h∂y+∂v̇h∂x)]+∂wh1∂y[C33(∂uh∂y+∂vh∂x)]dΩh,t=−∫Ωh,tf1∂wh1∂xdΩh,t+∫∂Ωh,tn1f1wh1ds,(3.14b)∫Ωh,t∂wh2∂y(D12∂u̇h∂x+D22∂v̇h∂y+C12∂uh∂x+C22∂vh∂y)+∂wh2∂x[D33(∂u̇h∂y+∂v̇h∂x)]+∂wh2∂x[C33(∂uh∂y+∂vh∂x)]dΩh,t=−∫Ωh,tf2∂wh2∂ydΩh,t+∫∂Ωh,tn2f2wh2ds,and(3.14c)ddt∫Ωh,tahwh3dΩh,t+∫Ωh,t(Da∇ah·∇wh3+kaahwh3)dΩh,t=∫Ωh,tkaacwh3dΩh,t+∫Ωh,taDwh3DtdΩh,t,for allwh1(x,t),wh2(x,t),wh3(x,t)∈Xh(t). Let nde represent the total number of degrees of freedom of the nodes for the finite element discretization. Also let the set(3.15){φi,φi∈Xh(t)⊂H1(Ωt),i=1,…,nde}represent piecewise linear finite element nodal basis functions satisfying thatφi(xj,t)={1ifi=j,0ifi≠j.We seek to find the finite element numerical approximationah(x,t),uh(x,t),vh(x,t)∈Xh(t)⊂X(Ωt)expressed as linear combinations of the linear nodal basis functionsφiof the form(3.16)ah(x,t)=∑i=1ndeai(t)φi(x,t),uh(x,t)=∑i=1ndeUi(t)φi(x,t),andvh(x,t)=∑i=1ndeVi(t)φi(x,t).We take the number of nodes nde inΩtto be large enough, typically in the orders of tens of thousands such that ah, uhand vhare a good approximation of a, u and v respectively.Transformation of local basis functions to a reference simplex. We denote the local basis functions on a reference elementS¯byφ¯iwithi=1,2,3. The local basis functionφi,i=1,2,3on an elementS∈Th,tcan be obtained byφi(x(t))=φ¯i(λS(x(t))),whereλSis the barycentric coordinates for a point(x,y,t)in an element S.Lemma 3.1Transport property of basis functions (Dziuk and Elliott [36])The finite element space on the discretized domain is a space of continuous piecewise linear functions whose nodal basis functions have the following property;(3.17)DφiSDt|S=0.The basis functionsφiS(x,t)j=1,2,3on S satisfyφiS(x(t))=φ¯i(λS(x(t))), whereλSis the barycentric coordinates for a point(x,y,t)in S. And the material derivative ofφiS(x(t))on an element S yieldsDDtφi(x(t))=DDtφ¯i(λS(x(t))=0becauseλS=(λ1,λ2,λ3)satisfies0≤λk≤1,k=1,2,3for a point(x,y,t)in S.□In order to write the semi-discrete finite element approximation of the force balance equation in block matrices form, we substitutewh1,wh2andwh3by the basis functionφj,(j=1,…,nde), uhand vhby their corresponding values as given in (3.16) into (3.14a) and (3.14b), then the resulting semi-discrete system of algebraic equations can be written in compact-matrix-vector form as(3.18)[A11(t)A12(t)A12(t)TA22(t)]{dUdt(t)dVdt(t)}+[B11(t)B12(t)B12(t)TB22(t)]{U(t)V(t)}={F1(t)F2(t)}where{U(t)V(t)}are solutions of the finite element semi-discrete (3.18). In (3.18) we denote byU(t)=(U1(t),…,Unde(t)),V(t)=(V1(t),…,Vnde(t)),dU/dt(t)=(dU1/dt(t),…,dUnde/dt(t))anddV/dt(t)=(dV1/dt(t),…,dVnde/dt(t))vectors of the solutions and their derivatives.Akl(t),Bkl(t),(k,l=1,2)andF(t)≔(F1(t),F2(t))Tare, respectively, the time dependent stiffness matrices and the generalized force vector. Their respective entries are defined byAij11(t)≔∫Ωh,t(D11∂φi(x(t))∂x∂φj(x(t))∂x+D33∂φi(x(t))∂y∂φj(x(t))∂y)dΩh,t,Aij22(t)≔∫Ωh,t(D33∂φi(x(t))∂x∂φj(x(t))∂x+D22∂φi(x(t))∂y∂φj(x(t))∂y)dΩh,t,Aij12(t)≔∫Ωh,t(D12∂φi(x(t))∂x∂φj(x(t))∂y+D33∂φi(x(t))∂y∂φj(x(t))∂x)dΩh,t,with:Bij11(t)≔∫Ωh,t(C11∂φi(x(t))∂x∂φj(x(t))∂x+C66∂φi(x(t))∂y∂φj(x(t))∂y)dΩh,t,Bij22(t)≔∫Ωh,t(C33∂φi(x(t))∂x∂φj(x(t))∂x+C22∂φi(x(t))∂y∂φj(x(t))∂y)dΩh,t,Bij12(t)≔∫Ωh,t(C12∂φi(x(t))∂x∂φj(x(t))∂y+C33∂φi(x(t))∂y∂φj(x(t))∂x)dΩh,t,andFj1(t)≔−∫Ωh,tf1(x(t))∂φj(x(t))∂xdΩh,t+∫∂Ωh,tn1f1(x(t))φj(x(t))ds,Fj2(t)=−∫Ωh,tf2(x(t))∂φj(x(t))∂ydΩh,t+∫∂Ωh,tn2f2(x(t))φj(x(t))ds.Appendix A illustrates how the normals, n1 and n2, to the cell boundary are computed and validated. For convenience's sake, we denote[A(t)]≔[A11(t)A12(t)A12(t)TA22(t)],[B(t)]≔[B11(t)B12(t)B12(t)TB22(t)],{W(t)}≔{U(t)V(t)},{dWdt(t)}≔{dUdt(t)dVdt(t)}and{F(t)}≔{F1(t)F2(t)}.Then we can write the semi-discrete finite element model for the force balance equation (3.18) in the following compact form:(3.19)[A(t)]{dWdt(t)}+[B(t)]{W(t)}=F(t).Remark 3.2Some entries of the block matrices[A]and[B]are non-symmetric matrices, hence[A]and[B]are non-symmetric block matrices.To proceed to write the semi-discrete finite element approximation of the reaction–diffusion equation in matrix-vector form, we substitute whby the basis functionφj,(j=1,…,nde)and ahby its corresponding value as given in (3.16) into (3.14c). Upon applying the transport property of basis functions (see Lemma 3.1 for details) we obtain the following semi-discrete system of algebraic equations written in compact-matrix-vector form:(3.20)ddt(M(t){a(t)})+(DaK(t)+kaM(t)){a(t)}=kaacH(t),where{a}=(a1,…,ande)are actin concentration solutions of the semi-discrete (3.20).M,KandHare the time dependent mass and stiffness matrices, and force vector, whose entries are defined respectively asMij(t)≔∫Ωh,tφi(x(t))φj(x(t))dΩh,t,Kij(t)≔∫Ωh,t∇φi(x(t))·∇φj(x(t))dΩh,tandHj(t)≔∫Ωh,tφj(x(t))dΩh,t.We discretize the time interval(0,Tf]into a finite number of uniform subintervals[tn,tn+1]such that0=t0<t1…<tn<tn+1≤Tf. The size of each time intervalτ≔tn+1−tn. In order to obtain a fully discrete finite element model of the coupled problem, we consider a modified implicit finite differentiation formula for the time integration of the semi-discrete finite element model of the force balance equation and the reaction–diffusion equation as given in (3.19) and (3.20) respectively. Thus the fully discrete finite element model of the coupled problem is given by(3.21a)([A(tn)]+τ[B(tn)]){W}n+1=[A(tn)]{W}n+τF(tn),and(3.21b)[(1+τka)M(tn+1)+τ(DaK(tn+1))]{a}n+1=M(tn){a}n+τkaacH(tn),where{W}n,{W}n+1and{a}n,{a}n+1are the displacement solutions and the actin concentrations at time tnandtn+1respectively. For the numerical implementation, the initial data{W}0and{a}0are interpolated on the initial meshΩh,0. All integral are evaluated using Gauss numerical quadrature [16]. At each time t,t∈I, we assemble the finite elements to obtain the system of linear algebraic (3.21). This system (3.21a) is solved using a generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) [38] while that of (3.21b) is solved using a conjugate gradient method (CG) with diagonal pre-conditioner [39,40].In order to track the evolution of the domain accurately, we specify a Lagrangian kinematic description of the domain. We assume that the displacement of the boundary of the domain occurs only in the direction that is normal to its non-deformed position. The displacement of the domain boundary at any time t corresponds to the solutions of the force balance equationW(x,t)=(U(x,t),V(x,t))at the boundary which in turn are dependent on the local concentration of the actin filamenta(x,t)at any particular space and time. The displacement of the interior nodes of the mesh is chosen to be equal to the flow velocityβ(i.e.β=ẋ). On the boundary we assume thatβ=ωn≔∂W/∂t, whereWis the displacement solution of the force balance equation.A limitation of the Lagrangian kinematic description is that the minimum angle condition for the mesh elements can be violated for non-constant mesh velocity and large mesh velocity. A remedy is to introduce a monitor function to check the quality of the mesh (say after a couple of mesh movements) and re-mesh when the elements are no longer favourable. It must be noted that re-meshing will introduce interpolation errors. In our case, the displacement solutions of the force balance equation are small in value hence the mesh velocity is small. For the time interval we considered, no mesh refinement was required. Developing adaptive time- and mesh-refinement strategies form part of our current studies for these types of models.The fully discrete coupled problem is solved iteratively. We present in Algorithm 3.1 the numerical algorithm for the method.Algorithm 3.1Fully discrete scheme.InitializeW0anda0. Set the time-step size toτ.FORn=1,…,TFwith time-step sizeτDOAssembleM(tn),H(tn),[A(tn)],[B(tn)]andF(tn).Solve for{W}n+1in(3.21a).Compute the new domain given{W}n+1AssembleM(tn+1)andK(tn+1)on the new domain.Solve for{a}n+1in(3.21b).END FORLett=nτ, whereτand n denotes the time-step size and number of time-steps respectively. The initial domain we consider is a unit diskΩ0. We assume that at time0<ts≪1the domain evolution is negligible and based on this assumption we are able to compare the finite element solutions to predictions from linear stability theory. The perturbations used in the initial conditions will be dependent on the eigenmode we seek to excite. We subsequently show that the finite element scheme gives numerical results that are consistent with those predicted by linear stability theory. In all our simulations rnd denotes a randomly generated number between 10−3 and 10−5 and a tilde will be used to denote non-dimensional parameter values.We present the numerical results for actin concentration ahand the displacement solutionsuh=(uh,vh)in Fig. 1(b) and (c) respectively. These results are consistent with those predicted by linear stability theory as given in Fig. B1(a). The initial conditions used were1.0009+rnd⁎sin(x), a finite element mesh with 2113 nodes was used andτ=1.0228×10−2.Let us fixp˜=1.646andψ˜=38.24respectively. For these parameter choices, the dispersion relation again isolates the lowest non-zero wavenumberk1,12. The initial conditions of the actin concentration are chosen to be equal toac+rnd⁎cos(x). We found that by choosing the perturbations in the initial conditions to bernd⁎cos(x), we encouraged the excitation of the eigenmode−w0,2, wherew0,2is the lowest eigenmode. The numerical simulation results are shown in Fig. 2for the actin concentrations ahand the displacement solutionsuh. We note that all numerical results foruhare plotted using its magnitude. For the sake of the comparison of the eigenmodew0,2to the numerical solutions we present in Fig. 2(a) a plot of the eigenmodew0,2.In Fig. 2(c), we observe that the displacement solutionsuhhas its highest value around the points wherex2+y2=0.8. These points correspond to the points whereδ(l)is discontinuous. It is clear that the method is able to provide accurate solutions as predicted by linear theory close to the bifurcation points.Far from the bifurcation points ofk1,12, we have the possibility of exciting mixed or higher modes. Below we present the numerical results for actin concentration ahand displacement solutionsuhshowing the excitation of mixed and higher modes.The excitation of mixed modes and higher modes is possible if the value ofψ˜is allowed to vary while all other parameters value are fixed (see Table B4 for possible values ofψ˜and the corresponding number of modes the dispersion relation isolates). We present in Figs. 3and 4the simulation results for actin concentration ahand the displacement solutions showing the excitation of mixed and higher modes respectively. We present in Table 2the value ofψused in the numerical simulations. A comparison of the predicted solutions from linear theory (Fig. 3(a) and (d)) with the numerical results (Fig. 3(b), (c) and (e), (f)) show that the numerical scheme reproduces results in close agreement to those predicted by linear stability theory for the mixed and higher modes for the actin concentration.Now that we have validated our numerical results by use of linear stability theory close to bifurcation points, we are in position to illustrate the robustness and applicability of the numerical method. By choosing appropriate model parameter values far away from bifurcation points, cell expansion and contraction (uniform) can be observed as well as non-uniform cell deformation as illustrated in the next.The simulation results showing the actin concentration solutions with uniform expansions are shown in Fig. 5for(ψ˜,p˜)=(70.366,0.433). In Fig. 5(e) we present a plot of the area of the cell against the number of time-steps taken to show the rate at which the area is increasing.For the sake of numerical experiment, we allow p to take a negative value. By choosingp˜=−0.433andψ˜=70.366we observe the cell contracting uniformly at positions that are equidistant from the centroid of the cell domain. And the concentration of actin increases from the boundary to the centroid. We show in Fig. 6the actin concentration solutions at a time (a)t=1.2046×10−3, (b)t=3.6137×10−3, (c) t=0.0361 and (d) t=0.5180. The initial conditions of actin concentration are still equal toac+rnd⁎cos(x).Non-uniform cell deformations occur if all parameter values in Table B1 stay unchanged butψ˜is increased or by choosing parameter valuesψ˜andp˜far away from bifurcation points (refer to Fig. B2 for a parameter space plot of(ψ˜,p˜)). Below we give the parameter values and the simulation results for both cases were non-uniform cell deformations occur. Here the initial conditions of actin concentration are given byac+rnd⁎cos(x).•If all model parameter values are kept fixed as given in Table B1, taking increasing values ofψ˜results in non-uniform cell deformations. For example takingψ˜=1.04×105, we observed from the numerical results that the cell deforms non-uniformly and rapidly making it impossible to capture the solutions and the numerical algorithm fails.If we chooseψ˜andp˜arbitrarily such that the parameter space(ψ˜,p˜)is very far from bifurcation points (for example,ψ˜=7.8×103andp˜=0.026), we observe non-uniform cell contraction with actin localized around the centroid of the cell (see Fig. 7). In Fig. 7(d) we present a plot of the cell area. A plot of the index of polarity against the number of time-step taken is given in Fig. 7(e).We recall that the simulation results presented in Fig. 7(e) was obtained forp˜=0.026andψ˜=7.8×103. Now if we decrease onlyψ˜such thatψ˜=1.3×103, we observe cell deformations which agree qualitatively to those observed experimentally [41]. It can be observed that actin concentration is high at the periphery of the cell boundary and is highest at regions were protrusions occur. In Fig. 8, we present the graphical display of the simulation results of the actin concentration. A plot of the index of polarity against the number of time-steps taken is given in Fig. 8(g). We can infer from these results that the dynamics of the cell domain, the distribution of actin filaments are related to the pressure coefficient p and the contractile tonicityψ.The distribution of F-actin in cells has been well studied and epifluorescence images are available in the literature. Fig. 9(a) shows an epifluorescence image of a Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cell obtained from [41]. The fibroblast was stained by the authors for F-actin after being allowed to spread for 1h. The epifluorescence image shows that F-actin is predominant at the cell periphery and is highest at the regions were protrusions occur. The simulation results presented in Fig. 9(b) are thus consistent with the experimental observations.Remark 4.1Key model parametersBased on the linear stability analysis and the numerical simulation results we are able to identify key parameters that control cell deformations with respect to the model problem. The contractile tonicityψis the bifurcation parameter and determines the transition from stable to unstable state. The actin saturation concentration asatand the pressure coefficient were also found to play a key role in cell deformations.Here we choose parameters for the cell such that they are consistent with those available in the literature such that Young's modulus E of the actin filament is 4000dyn/cm2[42], diffusion coefficient Daof the actin filament is1.6×10−10cm2/s[43,44], the polymerisation rate kais66/s[45], the values of the poisson ratioν, shear and bulk viscositiesμ1andμ2respectively are as given in Table 1. A cell of radius10μm(0.001 cm) is assumed. We also assume that the pressure coefficient is 800dyn/cm2 and the contractile tonicity is6.9×104dyn/cm2. We note that for these choice of dimensional parameter values the equivalent non-dimensional parameter values would have a dispersion relation that isolates more than 7 wavenumbers inclusive ofk4,12. We used an initial perturbation for actin equal to|rndsinxsiny|in order to bias the excitation of the modew4,1. The numerical simulation result gives protrusion on four fronts and is similar to the result given in Fig. 10.Understanding cell movement and deformation in cell motility, developmental biology and biomedical engineering promises to unearth new research strands currently unchartered. In many cases, the models derived are highly complex and nonlinear with no closed form analytical solutions. Furthermore, growth evolution (cell membrane movement and deformation) is an added parameter that makes it even more difficult to treat the models analytically. It remains therefore, to propose and develop novel numerical methods capable of providing approximate solutions. The numerical method should be robust, efficient, and should be able to deal easily with domain and surface evolution. In this article, we proposed the moving grid finite element method [1] to numerically compute solutions to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing cell movement and deformation. Our main contributions are:•a novel application of the MGFEM to solve a cytomechanical model that allows cells to move and deform arbitrarily.by using linear stability theory close to bifurcation points, we validated numerical results where linear solutions are analytically derived.far away from bifurcation points, we generate and observe complex cell deformations typically observed in experiments. Our numerical results show cell expansion, cell contraction, cell translation and relocation and cell protrusions.the contractile tonicity formed by the association of actin filaments to the myosin II motor proteins and the pressure coefficient are identified as key model bifurcation parameters of the model.
