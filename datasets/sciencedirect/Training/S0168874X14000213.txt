@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An efficient, smooth and accurate quadrilateral element with four-node based on the consecutive-interpolation procedure (CIP) is formulated. The CIP is developed recently by Zheng et al. (Acta Mech Sin 26 (2010) 265–278) for triangular element with three-node. In this setting the approximation functions handle both nodal values and averaged nodal gradients as interpolation conditions. Two stages of the interpolation are required; the primary stage is carried out using the same procedure of the standard finite element method (FEM), and the interpolation is further reproduced in the secondary step according to both nodal values and average nodal gradients derived from the previous interpolation. The new consecutive-interpolation quadrilateral element with four-node (CQ4) deserves many desirable characteristics of an efficient numerical method, which involves continuous nodal gradients, continuous nodal stresses without smoothing operation, higher-order polynomial basis, without increasing the degree of freedom of the system, straightforward to implement in an existing FEM computer code, etc. Four benchmark and two practical examples are considered for the stress analysis of elastic structures in two-dimension to show the accuracy and the efficiency of the new element. Detailed comparison and some other aspects including the convergence rate, volumetric locking, computational efficiency, insensitivity to the mesh, etc. are investigated. Numerical results substantially indicate that the consecutive-interpolation finite element method (CFEM) with notable features pertains to high accuracy, convergence rate, and efficiency as compared with the standard FEM.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Design procedures of improving and enhancing the performance of engineering structures through stress analysis are often time-consuming and expensive. Nowadays, simulation technologies using advanced numerical methods in engineering and science are popular and have been emerged rapidly. The motivations are to accurately model practical problems as exact as the techniques can. The finite element method (FEM) [1–3] and the boundary element method (BEM) [4] have become very powerful and versatile numerical methods, which are the most common and extensively used methods in a broad range of engineering applications. Owing to the simplicity, the three-node triangular and four-node quadrilateral finite elements are often introduced and applied to solve engineering problems in two-dimensions (2D). Because of the linear approximations, the spatial derivatives of the field variables are constant within each element [5]. Such constant-strain finite elements are easily formulated and implemented but their performance in practical applications is often unsatisfactory and, frequently low accuracy is obtained due to their low-order trial functions [5,6]. Moreover, the gradients on element-edges in both constant elements and mapped elements are discontinuous, and demanding smoothing operation in post-processing step is rigorous [7]. Other relevant issues involving volumetric locking and sensitivity to mesh, etc. for such elements can be found in Refs. [1–3,5–8] for instance.A number of advanced numerical methods have been developed in order for improving the accuracy and efficiency of the conventional FEM methods. For instance, Hansbo proposed a non-conforming rotated Q1 tetrahedral element for linear elastic [9] and elastodynamic problems [10]. By containing the bilinear terms, the Q1 element performs substantially better than the standard constant-strain one in bending and allows for under-integration in nearly incompressible situations. Papanicolopulos and Zervos [11] presented a means for creating a class of triangular C1 finite element particularly suitable for modeling problems where the underlying partial differential equation is of fourth-order (e.g., beam and plate bending, deformation of strain-gradient-dependent materials). Liu and his co-workers [12,13] introduced the smoothed finite element method based on the smoothing strain technique. An extension of the SFEM to stationary dynamic crack analysis of 2D elastic solids is studied by the author [14]. In recent years Hughes et al. [15] introduced the isogeometric analysis (IGA) using higher-order basis functions (e.g., Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) for constructing an exact geometrical model. The IGA soon after has been further extended to study many engineering problems. In the contrary to the mesh-based methods, the so-called meshfree or meshless methods, e.g., see Refs. [16–18], have introduced as alternative numerical approaches that do not require a predefined mesh, whereof the trial functions can be constructed through the scattered nodes without the reliance of the elements. The meshfree methods on one side involve several desirable features of an attractive numerical scheme in modeling various engineering problems, but one of their primary disadvantages lies in the expensive cost of using the more complex shape functions, which substantially induces a higher cost of the computation as compared with that of the mesh-based approaches, e.g., the FEM.As well-known in the standard FEM frameworks that the gradients on the element-edges using the constant-strain elements or mapped elements are discontinuous, and a smoothing operation is rigorously demanded in the post-processing. One possibility among others that can completely overcome such discontinuities without any smoothing operation is the novel consecutive-interpolation procedure (CIP) proposed by Zheng et al. [7]. They have already proved it for elasticity problems using their own CIP-based triangular element (CT3). Basically, the essence of the CIP technique is to enhance the trial functions by taking the continuous nodal gradients and a higher-order polynomial basis, by which several desirable characteristics when utilizing the consecutive-interpolation finite element method (CFEM) can be reached: (a) high accuracy in the field variables; (b) high convergence rate; (c) nodal stresses can be produced continuously without the aid of any smoothing operation; (d) insensitivity to mesh distortions; (e) volumetric locking is avoided in incompressible materials; (f) the total number of the degrees of freedom (DOFs) of the system does not change which implies that the total number of the DOFs discretized by the CFEM is the same as that by the FEM; (g) shape functions with higher-order polynomials possess the Kronecker-delta function property; and so on. The CFEM approximation functions are constructed through two stages of the interpolation. Apart from the primary interpolation, the same procedure of the classical FEM, the interpolation is further reproduced using the nodal values and averaged nodal gradients derived from the previous interpolation.The main objective of the present work is to precisely formulate a novel quadrilateral element with four-node based on the CIP approach (termed as CQ4), and then apply it to stress analysis of 2D elastic structures. The developed CQ4 element generally inherits all the superior characteristics and desirable properties of the CT3 element as pointed out above. Most importantly, the CFEM can be implemented straightforwardly from any existing computer FEM code. To show the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed CQ4 element, four benchmark examples and two practical applications with complex geometries are considered. The computed numerical results are then compared with analytical solutions, the CT3, the standard quadrilateral (Q4) and triangular (T3) solutions, as well as the FEM solutions using ANSYS. The convergence rate and the computational efficiency are investigated in detail. Additionally, the volumetric locking phenomenon occurring in incompressible materials is also addressed and it shows that the CQ4 can treat such problem without any modification.The paper is formed into five sections. After the introduction, the CIP technique is briefly presented in Section 2. The formulation of the CQ4 element is detailed in Section 3. Numerical examples are presented and discussed in Section 4. Some conclusions from the study are drawn in Section 5.Consider a 2D elastic body in the domainΩbounded byΓ=Γu+ΓtandΓu∩Γt=∅that can be described by the equilibrium equations as [1–3].(1)σij,j+bi=0inΩwherebidenotes the components of the body force vector andσijis the stress tensor. The balance equations, Eq. (1), satisfy the following boundary conditions:(2)σijnj=tionΓtandui=u¯ionΓuwithu¯irepresenting the prescribed boundary displacements onΓu,tibeing the traction components onΓtwhilenibeing the unit outward normal vector. The variational weak-form for this static elastic problem can be expressed as [1–3](3)∫Ωδ∇s(u)ijDijkl∇s(u)kldΩ−∫ΩδuibidΩ−∫ΓtδuitidΓ=0whereDijklis the elasticity tensor and∇s(u)ijdenotes the symmetric part of the displacement gradients i.e.,∇s(u)ij=(ui,j+uj,i)/2.In the FEM we approximate solutions to Eq. (3) by dividingΩand the boundaryΓinto small elements, and the interpolation is then determined by approximating the displacement field in each element. The element stiffness matrix is derived and it is then assembled into the global stiffness matrix [1–3]. Generally, this step is accomplished almost identically for the FEM and the CFEM.Now, we start describing the CIP procedure in a general and brief way. In the subsequent sections the formulation of the novel CQ4 element with four-node is detailed. For the sake of brevity, the following presentation will be focused on the displacement componentu1=uonly. The functionu(x)withx={x,y}Τin 2D in the FEM can be approximated by(4)u(x)=∑i=1nNi(x)di=N(x)dwherenis the number of nodes,dis the nodal displacement vector, whileN(x)is the vector of the shape functions, andNiare the shape functions of nodei. By assigning the approximation value at nodeiwithu[i]=u(xi), and the vector of the shape functions at nodeiwithN[i]=N(xi), the averaged nodal derivativesu¯,x[i](similar foru¯,y[i]) can then be determined by [7](5)u¯,x[i]=N¯,x[i]dwhereN¯,x[i]are the averaged derivative ofN[i], and calculated by(6)N¯,x[i]=∑e∈Si(we⋅N,x[i][e])withN,x[i][e]being the derivative ofN[i]computed in elemente. In Eq. (6),Siare a set of elements containing all the elements connected to nodei, whileweis a weight-function dependent on the element-type and it will be detailed in the subsequent section for the quadrilateral element.The shortcoming in the discontinuous stresses and strains caused by the discontinuity of the nodal gradients is well known in the standard FEM [7]. In the present CIP approach, both the nodal valuesu[i]and the averaged nodal derivativesu¯,x[i]are taken into the interpolations, which can substantially overcome such drawback of the discontinuities in the stress and strain fields. As a consequence the approximation functions in Eq. (4) can now be rewritten by means of the CIP scheme as follows:(7)u˜(x)=∑i=1n(ϕiu[i]+ϕixu¯,x[i]+ϕiyu¯,y[i])=∑i=1n(ϕiN[i]+ϕixN¯,x[i]+ϕiyN¯,y[i])dor(8)u˜(x)=N˜(x)dwhere the shape functions are given by(9)N˜=∑i=1n(ϕiN[i]+ϕixN¯,x[i]+ϕiyN¯,y[i])andϕi,ϕixandϕiyare the field functions dependent on the element-type, which will be detailed in the subsequent section for the quadrilateral element.Here, one important point to be stated is that the unknowns still contain only nodal displacements irrespective of the extension of the approximation functions including the nodal values and the averaged nodal derivatives. It means that no additional DOFs in the system are required for the CIP approach, an advantageous feature of the development of the CFEM. Another essential issue is also worth noting that the general solution procedure of the CFEM is very similar to that of the standard displacement-based FEM. So, any other steps in realization of the FEM scheme regardless of the CIP procedure could be applied the same in the implementation of the CFEM approach.In this section we shall formulate the quadrilateral element with four-node based on the CIP procedure. The four-node quadrilateral element in the global coordinate system can be mapped to the four-node rectangular element in the natural one as depicted inFig. 1. The geometry of the quadrilateral element can be described explicitly by(10)x=Li(r,s)xi+Lj(r,s)xj+Lk(r,s)xk+Lm(r,s)xm,y=Li(r,s)yi+Lj(r,s)yj+Lk(r,s)yk+Lm(r,s)ym,whereLi(r,s);Lj(r,s);Lk(r,s);andLm(r,s)are considered as geometric interpolation functions as(11)Li(r,s)=14(1−r)(1−s),Lj(r,s)=14(1+r)(1−s),Lk(r,s)=14(1+r)(1+s),Lm(r,s)=14(1−r)(1+s),and the partial derivatives can also be computed through the inverse Jacobian matrixJ−1by(12){∂∂x∂∂y}=J−1{∂∂r∂∂s}with(13)J=[∂x∂r∂y∂r∂x∂s∂y∂s]=[∂Li∂r∂Lj∂r∂Lk∂r∂Lm∂r∂Li∂s∂Lj∂s∂Lk∂s∂Lm∂s]{xiyixjyjxkykxmym}From Eqs. (10) and (11), theJ-matrix can be rewritten as(14)J=14[−(1−s)(1−s)(1+s)−(1+s)−(1−r)−(1+r)(1+r)(1−r)]{xiyixjyjxkykxmym}The approximation function at the point of interestxin a quadrilateral element in the framework of the conventional FEM can be expressed as(15)u(x)=Niu[i]+Nju[j]+Nku[k]+Nmu[m]where(16)Ni=Li,Nj=Lj,Nk=Lk,Nm=LmFig. 2 illustrates the application of the CIP method to the quadrilateral element described particularly in an irregular finite element mesh, in which the element setsSi,Sj,SkandSmcontain all the neighboring elements of nodei,j,kandm, respectively. It indicates that the supporting nodes for the point of interestxinclude all the nodes in the element setsSi,Sj,SkandSm. In any cases using the CFEM method, the support domain as the one shown in Fig. 2 is larger than that of the standard FEM. The weight-functions used for evaluating the averaged nodal derivatives of the field variables of the quadrilateral elementeare calculated similarly to that of the CT3 element, and they are given by(17)we=Δe∑e˜∈SiΔe˜,withe∈SiwhereΔeis the area of the elemente.By definingds={d1,d2,…,dns}Τas the displacement vector of the supporting nodes withnsbeing the number of the supporting nodes connected to the point of interestx, the interpolation of the standard FEM for any point inSi,Sj,Sk,andSmcan be determined by(18)u(x)=∑l=1nsNl(x)dlThe averaged derivatives of the field variables on nodeican then be computed as follows:(19)u¯,x[i]=∑e∈Siweu,x[i][e]=∑l=1ns[∑e∈Si(weNl,x[i][e])]dlu¯,y[i]=∑e∈Siweu,y[i][e]=∑l=1ns[∑e∈Si(weNl,y[i][e])]dl,or in compact form(20)u¯,x[i]=∑l=1nsN¯l,x[i]dl,u¯,y[i]=∑l=1nsN¯l,y[i]dlwhere(21)N¯l,x[i]=∑e∈Si(weNl,x[i][e]),N¯l,y[i]=∑e∈Si(weNl,y[i][e])As stated in the previous section, the consecutive stage is accomplished by taking the nodal values and averaged nodal derivatives into the interpolation scheme. The approximation function of the CQ4 element can be expressed as(22)u˜(x)=ϕiu[i]+ϕixu¯,x[i]+ϕiyu¯,y[i]︸relatedtonodei+ϕju[j]+ϕjxu¯,x[j]+ϕjyu¯,y[j]︸nodej+ϕku[k]+ϕkxu¯,x[k]+ϕkyu¯,y[k]︸nodek+ϕmu[m]+ϕmxu¯,x[m]+ϕmyu¯,y[m]︸nodemIn Eq. (22), theϕi,ϕix,andϕiyfunctions shown below must satisfy the following conditions (see Appendix A for proving this condition)(23)ϕi(xl)=δil,ϕi,x(xl)=0,ϕi,y(xl)=0,ϕix(xl)=0,ϕix,x(xl)=δil,ϕix,y(xl)=0,ϕiy(xl)=0,ϕiy,x(xl)=0,ϕiy,y(xl)=δil,wherelcan be any one of the indicesi,j,k,andm, and(24)δij={1ifi=j0ifi≠jWe note that the above conditions have to be applied in a similar manner to other functions, i.e.,ϕj,ϕjx,ϕjy,ϕk,ϕkx,ϕkyandϕm,ϕmx,ϕmy. Finally, theϕi,ϕixandϕiyfunctions can be computed for the CQ4 element as(25)ϕi=Li+Li2Lj+Li2Lk+Li2Lm−LiLj2−LiLk2−LiLm2,ϕix=−(xi−xj)(Li2Lj+pLiLjLk+pLiLjLm)−(xi−xk)(Li2Lk+pLiLkLm+pLiLkLj)−(xi−xm)(Li2Lm+pLiLmLj+pLiLmLk),ϕiy=−(yi−yj)(Li2Lj+pLiLjLk+pLiLjLm)−(yi−yk)(Li2Lk+pLiLkLm+pLiLkLj)−(yi−ym)(Li2Lm+pLiLmLj+pLiLmLk)In Eq. (25),p=1/2and theϕj,ϕjx,ϕjy;ϕk,ϕkx,ϕkyandϕm,ϕmx,ϕmyfunctions can be also computed in the same manner by a cyclic permutation of indicesi,j,kandm. By substitutingu¯,x[i];u¯,y[i]andϕinto Eq. (22), we finally arrive at(26)u˜(x)=∑l=1nsN˜l(x)dl=N˜(x)dwith the consecutive-interpolation shape functions(27)N˜l=ϕiNl[i]+ϕixN¯l,x[i]+ϕiyN¯l,y[i]︸relatedtonodei+ϕjNl[j]+ϕjxN¯l,x[j]+ϕjyN¯l,y[j]︸nodej+ϕkNl[k]+ϕkxN¯l,x[k]+ϕkyN¯l,y[k]︸nodek+ϕmNl[m]+ϕmxN¯l,x[m]+ϕmyN¯l,y[m]︸nodemOnce again, similar to the CT3 element the unknowns in the system using the CQ4 element contain only the nodal displacements, and no additional number of the DOFs is required for the CQ4 element. This issue shows a significant difference from the well-known conforming plate element, where the nodal derivatives are considered as additional DOFs [2,7].Remark: In general, the proposed CFEM interpolation is comparable to the Hermite interpolation as they use the nodal values and nodal gradients. However, it may be different in some details because the CFEM uses the “averaged nodal gradients” derived from finite element interpolation at each node instead.Figs. 3a and 3b show a comparison of the 1D shape functions and their first-order derivatives between the FEM and CFEM methods. It is observed in the figures that the curves of the CFEM shape functions and their derivatives are rather smooth and continuous as compared with those based on the FEM. The 2D shape functions derived from the Q4 and CQ4 elements are also visualized in Fig. 3c and d. Nevertheless, some important and desirable properties of the CFEM shape functions may be summarized as follows:(a)The approximation functions or the shape functions do not include any rational terms, and as a result they are advantageous for an accurate integration of the stiffness matrix.The shape functions have high-order continuities, i.e.,C∞inside the elements,C1on nodes andC0on the element edges. It is also noted that some nodes, for instance the nodes located on the essential boundary or on the interface of bi-materials, are required for the CQ4 to recover to aC0continuity. Hence a slight modification may be made on those nodes [7]. The CFEM will be degenerated into the FEM if all the nodes in the problem domain are supposed to beC0.Since the consecutive-interpolation passing through nodal values, the shape functions are hence said to be satisfied the Kronecker-delta function property.The consecutive-interpolation is said to be linear consistency as it can exactly reproduce any functions in the basis functions i.e.,∑i=1nsN˜i(x)=1;∑i=1nsN˜i(x)xi=x;∑i=1nsN˜i(x)yi=y.Before describing the stiffness matrix implementation and the numerical integration of the proposed CQ4 element, it must be stated here that the approximation function of the displacements using the FEM in Eq. (4) and the CFEM in Eq. (26) has a similar form. The only difference between them is the way of the construction of their shape functions. Therefore, the discrete equations derived from the weak-form in Eq. (3) shall be the same for both the FEM and the CFEM. As a result the element stiffness matrixKecan be finally expressed as [1–3].(28)Ke=∫ΩeBeTDBedΩIn Eq. (28), the domainΩeis different between the FEM and the CFEM, which fully depends on the supporting nodes and neighboring elements determined by the CFEM procedure. The matrix of the derivative of the shape functionsBeis also different between the FEM and the CFEM. Obviously, the difference can be depicted explicitly, for instance, let us consider a quadrilateral element with four-node presented in this study, the matrixBeobtained by the FEM method can be expressed as(29)BeFEM=[∂Ni∂x∂Nj∂x∂Nk∂x∂Nm∂x00000000∂Ni∂y∂Nj∂y∂Nk∂y∂Nm∂y∂Ni∂y∂Nj∂y∂Nk∂y∂Nm∂y∂Ni∂x∂Nj∂x∂Nk∂x∂Nm∂x](3×8)and the same but by the CFEM(30)BeCFEM=[∂N˜1∂x∂N˜2∂x⋯∂N˜l∂x⋯∂N˜ns∂x00⋯0⋯000⋯0⋯0∂N˜1∂y∂N˜2∂y⋯∂N˜l∂y⋯∂N˜ns∂y∂N˜1∂y∂N˜2∂y⋯∂N˜l∂y⋯∂N˜ns∂y∂N˜1∂x∂N˜2∂x⋯∂N˜l∂x⋯∂N˜ns∂x](3×2ns)In Eq. (30),nsis the number of the supporting nodes,1<l<nsandns>4. It is because that the displacements in the CFEM are not only interpolated from the nodal displacements of the considered element, but also interpolated from the supporting nodes determined by other neighboring elements, as sketched in Fig. 2. The size of the matrixBeFEMis of(3×8)and that is much smaller than the size of the matrixBeCFEM,(3×2ns), which results in an increased bandwidth of the stiffness matrix of the CFEM.In the above equations the derivative of the CFEM shape functions is calculated by(31)∂N˜l∂z=∂ϕi∂zNl[i]+∂ϕix∂zN¯l,x[i]+∂ϕiy∂zN¯l,y[i]︸relatedtonodei+∂ϕj∂zNl[j]+∂ϕjx∂zN¯l,x[j]+∂ϕjy∂zN¯l,y[j]︸nodej+∂ϕk∂zNl[k]+∂ϕkx∂zN¯l,x[k]+∂ϕky∂zN¯l,y[k]︸nodek+∂ϕm∂zNl[m]+∂ϕmx∂zN¯l,x[m]+∂ϕmy∂zN¯l,y[m]︸nodemwithz=x,y.In order to perform the numerical integration of the stiffness matrix of the CFEM method, we adopt a set of3×3Gaussian quadrature points for all the implementations throughout the study. It is because, in general, the implementation of the numerical integration in the CFEM is realized similar to that in the conventional FEM. None of any special techniques is required for the numerical integrations of the CQ4 element. Any quadrature rules used for the FEM can be applied the same for the CFEM, but it may obey the relation of the number of Gaussian pointsngpwith respect to the polynomial of orderpas indicated in Ref. [2], i.e.,p≤2ngp−1. Nonetheless, the variation and the influence of the Gauss quadrature rules on the accuracy of the solutions shall be studied numerically in the numerical example part. This is accomplished by considering the first six two-dimensional Gaussian quadrature rules from1×1to6×6respectively, and the two error indicators in the displacement and energy norms, as well as the maximum and minimum values of the von Mises stresses will be investigated accordingly.In this section four benchmark numerical examples are examined to show the accuracy, the efficiency and the convergence of the present CQ4 element. In addition, other two examples are considered as practical applications to illustrate the applicability of the proposed CQ4 element in dealing with complex geometries. The materials used for all the four benchmark examples are assumed to be linear elastic with Young׳s modulusE=1000and Poisson׳s ratioν=0.3, whereas they are specified thereafter for the two practical examples. The units used in the examples can be any consistent unit based on the international standard unit system, if not specified otherwise. To accomplish the convergence study, two error indicators with respect to the displacement and energy norms are defined as follows: [19,20](32)ed=∑i=1n(uiexact−uinumer)2∑i=1n(uiexact)2,(33)ee=1A12∫Ω(εexact−εnumer)TD(εexact−εnumer)dΩ,where the superscript “exact” represents the analytical solutions while “numer” stands for the numerical solutions, andAis the area of the problem domain.The satisfaction of the standard patch test in general requires the displacement fields of all the interior nodes of the patch that follow “exactly” the same linear functions of the imposed displacements on its boundaries [20]. As a consequence a sufficient condition for the convergence of a numerical method is to precisely pass such standard patch test. A1×1unit square domain of a patch test discretized by4×4regular and irregular quadrilateral elements with four-node as shown inFig. 4 is studied using the CFEM. The displacements are prescribed on all boundaries by the following linear functions:(34)ux=x,uy=yThe relative errors in the displacement normedare found to be2.0761e−016and2.4855e−016for the regular and irregular meshes, respectively. As a result, these error results indicate that the present CQ4 element passes the standard patch test successfully.A cantilever beam with lengthL=8and heightD=2subjected to a parabolic traction on the right end as depicted inFig. 5 is considered. The cantilever is assumed to have a unit thickness and the corresponding analytical solutions of the displacements and stresses based on the plane-stress condition are given by [21](35)ux=−Py6EI[(6L−3x)x+(2+ν)(y2−D24)],uy=P6EI[3νy2(L−x)+(4+5ν)D2x4+(3L−x)x2],(36)σx=−P(L−x)yI,σy=0,τxy=P2I[D24−y2]whereI=D3/12is the moment of inertia of the cantilever beam. For the plane-strain problem,Eandνin Eqs. (35) and (36) are replaced byE/(1−ν2)andν/(1−ν), respectively, andP=−2.To serve the validation purpose, four elements listed in the following are considered:(a)the CIP-based quadrilateral element with four-node: CQ4the CIP-based triangular element: CT3 [7]the standard quadrilateral element with four-node: Q4the standard triangular element with three-node: T3The convergence rate of all the aforementioned elements is analyzed using both the regular and distorted meshes. However, only the regular and irregular meshes of9×5,16×10and30×20quadrilateral elements with four-node are depicted inFig. 6, and the meshes discretized by using the triangular elements of the CT3 and T3 elements are omitted for the brevity.Fig. 7 illustrates the convergence rates in both the energy and displacement norms using the regular meshes with respect to the nodal ratioh(e.g.,h=1/9, 1/16, 1/30, 1/60) obtained by the CQ4, Q4, CT3, and T3 elements. It reveals in the figures that the proposed CQ4 element outperforms the T3 and Q4 elements as well as the CT3 once the mesh is further refined. In terms of the accuracy, the CFEM provides much better results than the FEM and the CQ4 element performs the best. Further study of the convergence rate is conducted using the distorted meshes, and their obtained convergence rates in both the displacement and energy norms are then sketched inFig. 8. Similar convergence rates for both the regular and distorted meshes are gained and, not surprisingly, the regular mesh desirably yields higher accuracy than the irregular one, as usual. However, the obtained results indicate that the irregular mesh has only a little effect on the accuracy.To investigate the accuracy of the developed CQ4 element, the beam is discretized using both the regular and irregular meshes of16×10elements. The numerical results of the displacement in y-direction along the neutral line and the shear stress along the middle line are obtained using the CQ4 (regular and irregular meshes), CT3, Q4 and T3 elements, and plotted inFigs. 9 and 10, respectively. The figures exhibit that the displacement and stress components obtained by the CQ4 and CT3 are all in good agreement with the analytical ones, whereas less accuracy can be found for the Q4 and T3 elements. For a better representation, the normal and shear stress distributions (e.g.,σx,τxy) obtained by the CQ4, Q4, T3 and SQ4 elements are depicted inFig. 11. Obviously, the stresses achieved by the Q4 and T3 elements are discontinuous and non-smooth whilst the developed CQ4 element works well, i.e., the stresses are continuous and smooth. It should be recalled that the developed CFEM is very smooth though no post-processing is performed.In Fig. 11, the SQ4 element is the standard Q4 but its final results (see Fig. 11d and h) are smoothed out by further applying a smoothing stress recovery technique in the post-processing step. These SQ4 results are motivated since it may be interesting to see how smooth on the stresses obtained by the present CFEM method and the one using the stress recovery technique as usually done in practice. By accomplishing that, we merely adopt one of the simplest stress recovery techniques that have been found most useful in practice, the averaged nodal stresses [22]. The realization of this so-called unweighted averaging is carried out by assigning the same weight to all elements that meet at a node. It is obvious that the SQ4 results are as smooth as the CQ4 ones.To check the ability of the present CFEM in treating the volume locking phenomenon in the incompressible materials (i.e., Poisson׳s ratio tends toward 0.5), the same problem but the beam is now set to be under plane-strain condition and Poison׳s ratio is taken asν=0.49to simulate a nearly incompressible material. Only the deflection along the neural line obtained by the four aforementioned methods is presented inFig. 12 together with the analytical solution. Note that results of the pressure and its convergence, or issues related to pressure modes, inf–sup satisfaction, etc. are not studied and do not cover in this manuscript because of simplicity. However, they are scheduled as our future research works. We see in the picture that the CFEM performs well as compared with the exact deflection, and it shows higher accuracy than the FEM. More importantly, based on these preliminary results it may be stated that the nearly incompressible materials can be treated by the CFEM with high accuracy, and the volumetric locking is alleviated.Another important issue in relevance to the computational efficiency of the developed CQ4 element is also studied. The computational time needed for the T3, Q4, CT3 and CQ4 elements tested on three different meshes of9×5,16×10and30×20elements, is investigated. Here, only the time required for the computation of the global stiffness matrix is measured and estimated. It is because that the most difference among the aforementioned methods is induced by the implementation of the stiffness matrix, which substantially pertains to the difference of establishing the shape functions and their derivatives. The comparison is performed on the same PC of Intel(R) Pentium(R) Dual-Core 2.6GHz, 2.GB RAM. 5 calculations are carried out for each mesh and the averaged computational time is then reported.Fig. 13 shows the required CPU time of different approaches using the same direct solver. Because of an extra task of the consecutive-interpolation implementation of the shape functions and their derivatives, the CQ4 and CT3 elements obviously require more time than the standard Q4 and T3 ones. On the other hand, the computational efficiency in terms of the relative errors in both the displacement and energy norms against the computational time (in seconds) is compared and depicted inFig. 14 under a log–log plot. It is evident that with respect to the computational efficiency (computational time for the same accuracy) the CFEM is more efficient as clearly shown in the relative error results in comparison with the FEM. From the practical point of view, it should be noted that to achieve acceptable solutions by using the standard FEM, demanding post-processing is often required and it may be a time-consuming task. In fact, it is difficult and/or even impossible to estimate how much time such task would take.Furthermore, as mentioned in Section 3.4, we now study numerically the effect of the Gaussian quadrature rules on the numerical results of the beam. This investigation is carried out by considering the first six two-dimensional Gaussian quadrature rules from1×1to6×6, and the two error indicators in the displacement (ed) and energy (ee) norms as well as the maximum and minimum values (σmax,σmin) of the von Mises stresses are estimated and explored. Two regular meshes of16×8and32×16discretized for the beam are considered. The corresponding obtained results are tabulated inTable 1. We observe in the table that as usual high error and less accuracy can be found for the quadrature rule of1×1, and the results are similar for other quadrature rules. It implies that higher number of the Gaussian quadrature rules does not influence too much on the accuracy of the results, but it may increase the computational time. As expected, the errors obtained by the finer mesh are found to be smaller than that by the coarser one. As a result we decide to use a set of3×3Gaussian quadrature rule for all the implementations throughout the study.Next benchmark example considers an infinite plate with a central circular hole of radiusaand subjected to a unidirectional tensile loadingTx=1as depicted inFig. 15a. Only one quarter of the plate (b=5,a=1) shown in Fig. 15b is modeled due to the two-fold symmetry. The analytical solutions of the displacement and stress fields of the infinite plate are given by [21](37)ur=Tx4μ[r[(κ−1)2+cos(2θ)]+a2r[1+(1+κ)cos(2θ)]−a4r3cos(2θ)],uθ=Tx4μ[(1−κ)a2r−r−a4r3]sin(2θ),(38)σx=Tx{1−a2r2[32cos(2θ)+cos(4θ)]+3a42r4cos(4θ)},σy=−Tx{a2r2[12cos(2θ)−cos(4θ)]+3a42r4cos(4θ)},τxy=−Tx{a2r2[12sin(2θ)+sin(4θ)]−3a42r4sin(4θ)},whereμ=E/(2(1+ν))andκis defined in terms of Poisson׳s ratio byκ=3−4νfor the plane-strain case and byκ=(3−ν)/(1+ν)for the plane-stress problem. In Eqs. (37) and (38),(r,θ)are the polar coordinates andθis measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis. The problem is first studied under a plane-strain assumption, the traction boundary conditions are imposed on the right and upper edges with the analytical stresses obtained using Eq. (38), and the following essential boundary conditions are imposed:(39)ux(x=0)=0,(1≤y≤5),uy(y=0)=0,(1≤x≤5)Similar to the previous beam example, the convergence study is presented.Fig. 16 essentially shows the convergence rate in both the energy and displacement norms using a regular mesh with respect to the nodal ratioh(e.g.,h=1/7, 1/13, 1/25) for different approaches. The obtained results of the convergence rate are not surprising, and as expected the developed CQ4 outperforms the CT3, T3 and Q4 elements when a mesh refinement is made. The CFEM provides much better results than the FEM as clearly seen in their relative errors in both the displacement and energy norms, and here again the present CQ4 is the winner.In terms of the accuracy,Fig. 17 further provides us a comparison of the stress distributions along the left and bottom boundaries of the quarter plate obtained by the CQ4 element using a regular mesh of13×13elements, and by the analytical solutions. The CFEM matches well with the exact solutions. Additionally,Fig. 18 shows the normal stress distributions of an infinite plate obtained, respectively, by the CQ4, CT3, Q4 and T3 elements. It is again observed that the stresses obtained by the CFEM are continuous and smooth whereas the standard FEM does not guarantee such smoothness and continuity.Similarly, the volumetric locking phenomenon is again analyzed numerically using a regular mesh of13×13elements with Poisson׳s ratio taken to beν=0.4999.Fig. 19 shows a comparison of the displacement distributions along the bottom (Fig. 19a) and left (Fig. 19b) boundaries of the quarter plate obtained by the present CQ4, the Q4 and the analytical approaches. It shows that the CFEM can still achieve better results with a Poisson׳s ratioν=0.4999while large errors are found for the standard Q4 element using the same mesh.Another benchmark example considers a hollow cylinder subjected to an internal pressure as depicted inFig. 20 to further show the accuracy of the CFEM. The cylinder is designed with an inner radius ofa, an outer radius ofband a unit thickness. A uniform pressure ofpis applied to the inner surface atr=a, whilst traction-free boundary condition is assigned at the outer surfacer=b. Only one-quarter of the cylinder is modeled due to the geometrical symmetry of the structure. The analytical solutions of the displacement and stress fields of this internally pressurized hollow cylinder are available and given by [21].(40)ur(r)=a2prE(b2−a2)[1−ν+b2r2(1+ν)],uθ=0,(41)σr(r)=a2p(b2−a2)[1−b2r2],σθ(r)=a2p(b2−a2)[1+b2r2],τrθ=0In the numerical investigation, the following parameters are used:a=1,b=5,p=1, and the plane-stress condition is assumed. We first explore the convergence rate of the different methods by considering three regular and three irregular meshes of6×6,12×12,22×22and32×32elements. Only the case of the regular and distorted meshes with12×12elements is shown inFig. 21.Fig. 22 shows a comparison of the convergence rates in both the energy and displacement norms with respect to the nodal ratioh(e.g.,h=1/7, 1/13, 1/23, 1/33) obtained by the CQ4, CT3, Q4 and T3 elements. Again and similar to the previous examples, the numerical results clearly confirm the high accuracy and convergence rate of the present CFEM.For the accuracy study, the problem is discretized by using the regular and irregular meshes with12×12elements, and the obtained numerical solutions using several aforementioned methods are plotted inFigs. 23 and 24 for the displacement and stress fields, respectively. The results obtained by the CFEM agree well with the analytical solutions, but the standard FEM yields less accuracy. The radial stress componentσrderived by the four approaches is also depicted inFig. 25 and one clearly observes in the figures that the CFEM provides much smoother stresses than the FEM using the same mesh.The major objective of the subsequent numerical examples is to further demonstrate the applicability of the CFEM method to the problems of complex geometry. The first practical example considers a corner angle bracket with its geometry as depicted inFig. 26a. The corner bracket is popularly used in many engineering applications. The bracket in this study is made of steel with a Young׳s modulus of 206.84GPa, Poisson׳s ratio of 0.27, and the plane-stress condition is assumed [23]. The upper left-hand pin hole is constrained around its entire circumference, and a tapered pressure load is applied to the bottom of the lower right-hand hole. The corner bracket is discretized with irregular meshes (see Fig. 26b) using the present CQ4, the Q4 elements, and ANSYS with the PLANE42 element. The results computed by the ANSYS are used here as a reference solution, and the bracket is discretized with different refinements using the standard 4-node element starting from approximately 700 elements up to almost 16,000 elements. A maximum value of the von Mises stress of 19.705MPa is obtained for a fine mesh. On the other hand, the bracket is also discretized by an irregular mesh of 1282 elements (see Fig. 26b) using quadrilateral elements. The maximum von Mises stresses are obtained, respectively, as 19.8817MPa by the CQ4 and 20.2707MPa by the Q4 elements. As compared with the ANSYS-based von Mises value, one can see that the calculated CQ4 solution is closer than that of the Q4 element for the same mesh.Fig. 27 depicts the distribution of the von Mises stresses in the bracket by the CQ4 (a), Q4 (b) and ANSYS11Note that we use the ANSYS׳s command such as (PLESOL, S, EQV) to plot the stresses.using PLANE42 with course (c) and fine (d) meshes. A very good agreement in the stress distributions obtained by different approaches is found. However, the CQ4 element again provides much smoother stresses than the Q4 element.Finally, a common micro-actuator in the form of a side-driving electrostatic micro-motor used in MEMs devices is analyzed [3]. Such micro-motor is usually made from polysilicon using lithographic techniques. The material parameters of the polysilicon are Young׳s modulus of 169GPa and Poisson׳s ratio of 0.262. Isotropic material properties are employed to simplify the problem. A real model of the micro-rotor can be found in Ref. [3], and due to its symmetry only one quarter with the corresponding boundary conditions as depicted inFig. 28a is taken. Typically, a finite element mesh of the domain discretized by 96 quadrilateral elements with four-node is depicted in Fig. 28b. Similar to the bracket example, reference solutions are also derived from the FEM using ANSYS. Thus, different refinements from a coarse mesh to a very fine one are performed, and the maximum von Mises stress at the corners of the rotor obtained by ANSYS using a very fine mesh is 18.832MPa. The solutions computed by the CQ4 and Q4 elements, respectively, are 18.837MPa and 22.599MPa, and as a result it again reveals the high accuracy of the CFEM.Fig. 29 similarly shows the von Mises stress distributions in the rotor obtained by the CQ4 (a) and Q4 (b) elements, respectively, and smoother stresses are achieved by using the CFEM rather than the FEM for the same mesh.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
An efficient and accurate quadrilateral element with four-node based on the CIP is formulated. The developed CQ4 element is applied to the stress analysis of 2D elastic structures. The advantages of the CFEM are due to the fact that the stresses and strains at nodes are continuous, smooth and it requires no smoothing operation in the post-processing step. From the numerical results of the four benchmark examples, it confirms the high accuracy of the CFEM that pertains to high convergence rate as compared with the standard FEM (Q4, T3) and even the CT3. Highly accurate results in the practical examples further confirm the applicability of the present CFEM in the stress analysis of 2D elastic structures with complex configuration. The CIP algorithm is general and has no limitations on its extension to other elements such as tetrahedral and brick elements in 3D. The extension of the method is also attractive to the incompressible media, in which some relevant issues pertaining to the pressure modes, convergence, the inf–sup satisfaction, etc. should be investigated and addressed in detail. From the present research work, the following conclusions can be drawn:•The shape functions of the present CQ4 element are higher-order polynomials and possess the Kronecker-delta function property, which allows a straightforward imposition of the essential boundary conditions.As compared with the traditional FEM (Q4, T3) and even the CT3 element, the CQ4 substantially pertains to higher accuracy, higher efficiency and higher convergence rate. Specially, nodal stresses are generated continuously without any smoothing operation; mesh distortions are insensitive; based on the preliminary results it shows that the volumetric locking is alleviated in incompressible materials; and without the increase of the DOFs in the system.The present CFEM method is straightforwardly implemented in any existing computer FEM code.No post-processing is required in the CFEM.
