@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We investigate how and when to diversify capital over assets, i.e., the portfolio selection problem, from a signal processing perspective. To this end, we first construct portfolios that achieve the optimal expected growth in i.i.d. discrete-time two-asset markets under proportional transaction costs. We then extend our analysis to cover markets having more than two stocks. The market is modeled by a sequence of price relative vectors with arbitrary discrete distributions, which can also be used to approximate a wide class of continuous distributions. To achieve the optimal growth, we use threshold portfolios, where we introduce a recursive update to calculate the expected wealth. We then demonstrate that under the threshold rebalancing framework, the achievable set of portfolios elegantly form an irreducible Markov chain under mild technical conditions. We evaluate the corresponding stationary distribution of this Markov chain, which provides a natural and efficient method to calculate the cumulative expected wealth. Subsequently, the corresponding parameters are optimized yielding the growth optimal portfolio under proportional transaction costs in i.i.d. discrete-time two-asset markets. As a widely known financial problem, we also solve the optimal portfolio selection problem in discrete-time markets constructed by sampling continuous-time Brownian markets. For the case that the underlying discrete distributions of the price relative vectors are unknown, we provide a maximum likelihood estimator that is also incorporated in the optimization framework in our simulations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The problem of how and when an investor should diversify capital over various assets, whose future returns are yet to be realized, is extensively studied in various different fields from signal processing [1,2,12,28–30,33,35] and financial engineering [25,26] to machine learning [13,34] and information theory [9]. Naturally, this is one of the most important financial applications due to the amount of money involved. However, the recent financial crisis demonstrated that there is a significant room for improvement in this field by sound signal processing methods [12,30], which is the main goal of this paper. In this paper, we investigate how and when to diversify capital over assets, i.e., the portfolio selection problem, from a signal processing perspective and provide portfolio selection strategies that maximize the expected cumulative wealth in discrete-time markets under proportional transaction costs.In particular, we study an investment problem in markets that allows trading at discrete periods, where the discrete period is arbitrary, e.g., it can be seconds, minutes or days [24]. Furthermore, the market levies transaction fees for both selling and buying an asset proportional to the volume of trading at each transaction, which accurately models a broad range of financial markets [3,24]. In our discussions, we first consider markets with two assets. Two-stock markets are extensively studied in financial literature and are shown to accurately model a wide range of financial applications [24] such as the well-known “Stock and Bond Market” [24]. We then extend our analysis to markets having more than two assets, i.e., m-stock markets, where m is arbitrary.Following the extensive literature [9,19,24–26,33], the market is modeled by a sequence of price relative vectors, say{X(n)}n≥1,X(n)∈[0,∞)m, where each entry ofX(n), i.e.,Xi(n)∈[0,∞), is the ratio of the closing price to the opening price of the ith stock per investment period. Hence, each entry ofX(n)quantifies the gain (or the loss) of that asset at each investment period. The sequence of price relative vectors is assumed to have an i.i.d. “discrete” distribution [24–26,33], however, the discrete distributions on the vector of price relatives are arbitrary. In this sense, the corresponding discrete distributions can approximate a wide class of continuous distributions on the price relatives that satisfy certain regularity conditions by appropriately increasing the size of the discrete sample space. We first assume that the discrete distributions on the price relative vectors are known and then extend our analysis to cover the case, where the underlying distributions are unknown. We emphasize that the i.i.d. assumption on the sequence of price relative vectors is shown to hold in most realistic markets [14,24].At each investment period, the diversification of the capital over the assets is represented by a portfolio vectorb(n), where∀i∈{1,…,m},bi(n)represents the ratio of the capital invested in the ith asset at investment period n, i.e., we have∑i=1mbi(n)=1, where0≤bi(n)≤1. As an example, if we invest usingb(n), we earn (or lose)bT(n)X(n)at the nth investment period, afterX(n)is revealed. Given that we start with one dollar, after an investment period of N days, we have the wealth growth∏n=1NbT(n)X(n). Under this general market model, we provide algorithms that maximize the expected growth over any period N by using “threshold rebalanced portfolios” (TRPs), which are shown to yield optimal growth in general i.i.d. discrete-time markets [14].In [9], Cover et al. showed that the portfolio that achieves the maximal growth is a constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP) in i.i.d. discrete-time markets, under certain assumptions on the sequence of price relatives and without any transaction costs. A CRP is a portfolio investment strategy, where the fraction of wealth invested in each stock is kept constant at each investment period. A problem extensively studied in this framework is to find sequential portfolios that asymptotically achieve the wealth of the best CRP tuned to the underlying sequence of price relatives. Several sequential algorithms are introduced to achieve the performance of the best CRP (such as [9,13,16,34]) with different convergence rates and different performances on historical data sets. In [3], sequential algorithms that achieve the performance of the best CRP under transaction costs are introduced. However, we emphasize that keeping a CRP may require extensive trading due to a possible rebalancing at each investment period which deems CRPs (even the best CRP) ineffective in realistic markets even under mild transaction costs [19].In continuous-time markets, however, it has been shown that under transaction costs, the optimal portfolios that achieve the maximal wealth are certain class of “no-trade zone” portfolios [7,11,32]. In simple terms, a no-trade zone portfolio has a compact closed set and a rebalancing occurs if the current portfolio breaches this set, otherwise no rebalancing occurs. Clearly, such a no-trade zone portfolio may avoid hefty transaction costs since it can limit excessive rebalancing by defining appropriate no-trade zones. Analogous to continuous time markets, it has been shown in [14] that in two-asset i.i.d. markets under proportional transaction costs, compact no-trade zone portfolios are optimal such that they achieve the maximal growth under certain assumptions on the sequence of price relatives. In two-asset markets, the compact no-trade zone is represented by thresholds, e.g., if at investment period n, the portfolio is given byb(n)=[b(n),(1−b(n))]T, where0≤b(n)≤1, then rebalancing occurs ifb(n)∉(α,β), given the thresholds α, β, where0≤α≤β≤1. Similarly, the interval(α,β)can be represented using a target portfolio b and a region around it, i.e.,(b−ϵ,b+ϵ), where0≤ϵ≤min⁡{b,1−b}such thatα=b−ϵandβ=b+ϵ. Extension of TRPs to markets having more than two stocks is straightforward and explained in Section 3.2.However, how to construct the no-trade zone portfolio, i.e., how to select the thresholds that achieve the maximal growth, has not yet been solved except in elementary scenarios [14]. In [15], a universal algorithm that asymptotically achieves the performance of the best TRP tuned to the underlying sequence of price relatives is introduced. This algorithm leverages Bayesian type weighting from [9] inspired from universal source coding and requires no statistical assumptions on the sequence of price relatives. In similar lines, various different universal algorithms are introduced that achieve the performance of the best expert in different competition classes in [1,2,17–20]. Although the performance guarantees in [1,2,15,18,19]) are derived without any stochastic assumptions, these methods are highly conservative due to the worst case scenario optimization, i.e., they are only optimal in an asymptotical sense. However, the order of such performance upper bounds may not be negligible in actual financial markets [6,20], even though they may be neglected in source coding applications (where these algorithms are inspired from). We demonstrate that our algorithm readily outperforms these universal methods over historical data.Our main contributions are as follows. We first consider two-asset markets and recursively evaluate the expected achieved wealth of a threshold portfolio for any b and ϵ over any investment period. We then extend this analysis to markets having more than two-stocks. We next demonstrate that under the threshold rebalancing framework, the achievable set of portfolios form an irreducible Markov chain under mild technical conditions. We evaluate the corresponding stationary distribution of this Markov chain, which provides a natural and efficient method to calculate the cumulative expected wealth. Subsequently, the corresponding parameters are optimized using a brute force approach yielding the growth optimal investment portfolio under proportional transaction costs in i.i.d. discrete-time two-asset markets. We note that for the case with the irreducible Markov chain, which covers practically all scenarios in the realistic markets, the optimization of the parameters is offline and carried out only once. However, for the case with recursive calculations, the algorithm has an exponential computational complexity in terms of the number of states. However, in our simulations, we observe that a reduced complexity form of the recursive algorithm that keeps only a constant number of states by appropriately pruning certain states provides nearly identical results with the “optimal” algorithm. Furthermore, as a well studied problem, we also solve optimal portfolio selection in discrete-time markets constructed by sampling continuous-time Brownian markets [24]. When the underlying discrete distributions of the price relative vectors are unknown, we provide a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the corresponding distributions that is incorporated in the optimization framework in the Simulations section. For all these approaches, we also provide the corresponding complexity bounds.The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe our discrete-time stock market model with discrete price relatives and symmetric proportional transaction costs. In Section 3, we start to investigate TRPs, where we first introduce a recursive update in Section 3.1 for a market having two-stocks. Generalization of the iterative algorithm to the m-asset market case is provided in Section 3.2. We then show that the TRP framework can be analyzed using finite state Markov chains in Section 3.4 and Section 3.5. The special Brownian market is analyzed in Section 3.6. The maximum likelihood estimator is derived in Section 4. We simulate the performance of our algorithms in Section 5 and conclude the paper with certain remarks in Section 6.We consider discrete-time stock markets under transaction costs. We first consider a market with two stocks and then extend the analysis to markets having more than two stocks. We model the market using a sequence of price relative vectorsX(n). A vector of price relativesX(n)=[X1(n),…,Xm(n)]Tin a market of m assets represents the change in the prices of the assets over investment period n, i.e., for the ith stockXi(n)is the ratio of the closing to the opening price of the ith stock over period n. For a market having two assets, we haveX(n)=[X1(n)X2(n)]T. We assume that the price relative sequencesX1(n)andX2(n)are i.i.d. over with possibly different discrete sample spacesX1andX2, i.e.,X1(n)∈X1andX2(n)∈X2, respectively [14]. For technical reasons, in our derivations, we assume that the sample space isX≜X1∪X2={x1,x2,…,xK}for bothX1(n)andX2(n)where|X|=Kis the cardinality of the setX. The probability mass function (pmf) ofX1(n)isp1(x)≜Pr(X1=x)and the pmf ofX2(n)isp2(x)≜Pr(X2=x). We definepi,1=p1(xi)andpi,2=p2(xi)forxi∈Xand the probability mass vectorsp1=[p1,1p2,1…pK,1]Tandp2=[p1,2p2,2…pK,2]T, respectively. Here, we first assume that the corresponding probability mass vectorsp1andp2are known. We then extend our analysis to the case, wherep1andp2are unknown, and sequentially estimatep1andp2using a maximum likelihood estimator in Section 4.An allocation of wealth over two stocks is represented by the portfolio vectorb(n)=[b1(n),b2(n)]T, whereb1(n)andb2(n)represents the proportion of wealth invested in the first and second stocks, respectively, at investment period n. In two stock markets, we haveb2(n)=1−b1(n), thusb(n)is completely characterized by the proportion of the total wealth invested in the first stock, i.e.,b1(n). For notational clarity, we useb(n)instead ofb1(n)throughout the paper, hence our portfolio vector is denoted byb(n)=[b(n),1−b(n)]T.We denote a threshold rebalancing portfolio with an initial and target portfolio b and a threshold ϵ byTRP(b,ϵ). At each market period n, an investor rebalances the asset allocation only if the portfolio leaves the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ). Whenb(n)∉(b−ϵ,b+ϵ), the investor buys and sells stocks so that the asset allocation is rebalanced to the initial allocation, i.e.,b(n)=b, where the investor has to pay transaction fees. We emphasize that the rebalancing can be made directly to the closest boundary instead of to b as suggested in [14], however, we rebalance to b for notational simplicity, whereas our derivations also hold for the rebalancing to the boundary case. We model the transaction cost of rebalancing by a fixed proportional costc∈(0,1)[3,14,19]. As an example, if the investor buys or sells S dollars of stocks, then he pays cS dollars of transaction fees. Although we assume a symmetric transaction cost ratio, all the results can be carried over to markets with asymmetric costs [14,19].We letS(N)denote the achieved wealth at investment period N and assume, without loss of generality, that the initial wealth of the investor is 1 dollar. Then, as an example, if the portfoliob(n)does not leave the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)and the allocation of wealth is not rebalanced for N investment periods, then the achieved wealth is given byS(N)=b∏n=1NX1(n)+(1−b)∏n=1NX2(n)and the current proportion of wealth invested in the first stock is given byb(N)=[b∏n=1NX1(n)]/S(N). On the other hand, if the portfolio leaves the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)at period N, i.e.,b(N)∉(b−ϵ,b+ϵ), then the investor rebalances the asset distribution to the initial distribution and payscS(N)|b(N)−b|dollars for transaction costs [3]. In the next section, we first derive a compact form for the expected achieved wealthE[S(N)]so that we can optimize b and ϵ to maximizeE[S(N)].In this section, we first investigate TRPs in discrete-time two-asset markets under proportional transaction costs. We first introduce an iterative method to calculate the expected achieved wealth at a given investment period. We then present an upper bound on the complexity of this algorithm. We next calculate the expected achieved wealth of markets having more than two assets, i.e., m-asset markets for an arbitrary m. We then provide the necessary and sufficient conditions such that the achievable portfolios are finite such that the complexity of the algorithm does not grow at any period. We also show that the portfolio sequence converges to a stationary distribution and derive the expected achieved wealth. Based on the calculation of the expected achieved wealth, we optimize b and ϵ using a brute-force search. Finally, with these derivations, we consider the well-known discrete-time two-asset Brownian market with proportional transaction costs and investigate the asymptotic expected achieved wealth.Before introducing the iterative algorithm, we first define the set of achievable portfolios at each investment period since the iterative calculation of the expected achieved wealth is based on the achievable portfolio set. We then introduce the portfolio transition sets and the transition probabilities of achievable portfolios at successive investment periods in order to iteratively find the probability of each portfolio state and to calculateE[S(N)].We define the set of achievable portfolios at each investment period as follows. As|X|=K<∞, the set of achievable portfolios at period N can only have finitely many elements. We define the set of achievable portfolios at period N asBN={b1,N,…,bMN,N}, whereMN≜|BN|. As illustrated in Fig. 1, for each achievable portfoliobm,N∈BN,m=1,…,MN, there is a certain set of portfolios inBN−1that are connected tobm,n. At a given investment period N, the set of achievable portfoliosBNis given by(1)BN={b}∪{bm,N:bm,N=bk,N−1ubk,N−1u+(1−bk,N−1)v∈(b−ϵ,b+ϵ),u,v∈X}.Since b is an achievable portfolio at each N (due to a possible rebalancing), without loss of generality, we letb1,N=bfor eachN∈N. Note that in Fig. 1, the size of the set of achievable portfolios may grow as N increases.Having constructed a state transition diagram, we next represent the transition probabilities frombk,N−1tobm,Nas follows(2)qk,m,N≜Pr(b(N)=bm,N|b(N−1)=bk,N−1),wherek=1,…,MN−1andm=1,…,MN. Given thatb(N)=bm,N, for somem=1,…,MN, there exists a corresponding set of portfoliosNm,N⊂BN−1from whichbm,Nis achievable, i.e.,(3)Nm,N≜{bk,N−1∈BN−1:qk,m,N>0,k=1,…,MN−1}wherem=1,…,MN. Then, the probability of each portfolio state can be calculated as follows(4)Pr(b(N)=bm,N)=∑bk,N−1∈Nm,Nqk,m,NPr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)wherem=1,…,MN. By the definition ofBNand using the law of total expectation [31], we can write(5)E[S(N)]=∑m=1MNPr(b(N)=bm,N)E[S(N)|b(N)=bm,N].To obtain an iterative formulation using (5), we next find the transition probabilities between achievable portfolios.To accomplish this, we letUk,m,Ndenote the set of price relative vectors that connectbk,N−1tobm,N, i.e.,Uk,m,N≜{w=[w1,w2]T∈X2:w1bk,N−1w1bk,N−1+w2(1−bk,N−1)=bm,N},fork=1,…,MN−1andm=2,…,MN. We consider the price relative vectors that connectbk,N−1tob1,N=bseparately since, in this case, there are two subcases depending on whether the portfolio leaves the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)or not. We letUk,1,N=Vk,1,N∪Rk,1,N, whereVk,1,Nis the set of price relative vectors that connectbk,N−1tob1,N=bwithout rebalancing, i.e.,(6)Vk,1,N={w=[w1,w2]T∈X2:w1bk,N−1w1bk,N−1+w2(1−bk,N−1)=b},andRk,1,Nis the set of price relative vectors that connectbk,N−1tob1,Nwith rebalancing, i.e.,(7)Rk,1,N={w=[w1,w2]T∈X2:w1bk,N−1w1bk,N−1+w2(1−bk,N−1)∉(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)}.With these definitions, we can obtain the transition probabilities as follows(8)qk,m,N=Pr(X(N)∈Uk,m,N)=∑w∈Uk,m,Np1(w1)p2(w2),wherek=1,…,MN−1andm=1,…,MN.Having derived a recursive formulation for the state probabilities, we can calculate the term in the sum in (5) by considering two separate cases as follows.i) As the first case, we considerb(N)=bm,N, wherem=2,…,MN, i.e., we know that the portfolio does not leave the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)at period N. Therefore, no transaction cost is paid and we have(9)Pr(b(N)=bm,N)E[S(N)|b(N)=bm,N]=∑bk,N−1∈Nm,NE[S(N)|b(N)=bm,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1]×Pr(b(N)=bm,N)Pr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1|b(N)=bm,N)(10)=∑bk,N−1∈Nm,NE[S(N)|b(N)=bm,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1]×Pr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)qk,m,N,(11)=∑bk,N−1∈Nm,NE[S(N)|b(N)=bm,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1]×Pr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)Pr(X(N)∈Uk,m,N),(12)=∑bk,N−1∈Nm,N∑w∈Uk,m,NE[S(N)|b(N)=bm,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1,X(N)=w]×Pr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)Pr(X(N)=w|X(N)∈Uk,m,N)×Pr(X(N)∈Uk,m,N),where (9) and (12) follow from the law of total expectation [31], (10) follows from Bayes' theorem [31], and (11) follows from (2). As no rebalancing occurs, we also have(13)E[SN|b(N)=bm,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1,X(N)=w]=E[S(N−1)(bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2)|b(N−1)=bk,N−1].Putting (13) back in (12), we obtain(14)Pr(b(N)=bm,N)E[S(N)|b(N)=bm,N]=∑bk,N−1∈Nm,N∑w∈Uk,m,NPr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)Pr(X(N)=w)×E[S(N−1)(bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2)|b(N−1)=bk,N−1](15)=∑bk,N−1∈Nm,NPr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)×E[S(N−1)|b(N−1)=bk,N−1]×∑w∈Uk,m,N(bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2)p1(w1)p2(w2),where the last line follows sincePr(X(N)=w)=p1(w1)p2(w2).ii) In the second case, we haveb(N)=b1,N. For this case, ifX(N)∈Vk,1,N, then the portfolio is not rebalanced and no transaction fee is paid; whereas ifX(N)∈Rk,1,N, then the portfolio is rebalanced and transaction cost is paid. Thus, we have(16)Pr(b(N)=b1,N)E[S(N)|b(N)=b1,N]=∑bk,N−1∈N1,NE[S(N)|b(N)=b1,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1]×Pr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)qk,1,N(17)=∑bk,N−1∈N1,N{∑w∈Vk,1,NPr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)Pr(X(N)=w)×E[SN|b(N)=b1,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1,X(N)=w]+∑w∈Rk,1,NPr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)Pr(X(N)=w)×E[SN|b(N)=b1,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1,X(N)=w]},where (16) follows from (10) and the last line follows in similar lines to (14). Here, whenX(N)=w∈Vk,1,N, no rebalancing occurs. Thus, we have(18)E[SN|b(N)=b1,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1,X(N)=w]=E[S(N−1)(bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2)|b(N−1)=bk,N−1].On the other hand, whenX(N)=w∈Rk,1,N, rebalancing occurs. Hence, we have(19)E[SN|b(N)=b1,N,b(N−1)=bk,N−1,X(N)=w]=E[S(N−1)(bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2)×(1−c|bk,N−1w1bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2−b|)|b(N−1)=bk,N−1].Putting (18) and (19) back in (17), we obtainPr(b(N)=b1,N)E[S(N)|b(N)=b1,N]=∑bk,N−1∈N1,NPr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1){∑w∈Vk,1,NPr(X(N)=w)×E[S(N−1)(bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2)|b(N−1)=bk,N−1]+∑w∈Rk,1,NPr(X(N)=w)×E[S(N−1)(bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1))×(1−c|bk,N−1w1bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2−b|)|b(N−1)=bk,N−1]}.After some algebra, we obtain(20)Pr(b(N)=b1,N)E[S(N)|b(N)=b1,N]=∑bk,N−1∈N1,NPr(b(N−1)=bk,N−1)×E[S(N−1)|b(N−1)=bk,N−1]×{∑w∈Vk,1,N(bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2)p1(w1)p2(w2)+∑w∈Rk,1,N(bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2)p1(w1)p2(w2)×(1−c|bk,N−1w1bk,N−1w1+(1−bk,N−1)w2−b|)}.Hence, we can iteratively calculate (5)i) using (15), for the case whereb(N)=bl,Nandl=2,…MN, ii) using (20), for the case whereb(N)=b1,N=b. Since we have the recursive formulation, we can optimize b and ϵ by a brute force search as shown in the Simulations section. In the following section, we extend our analyses to the m-asset market case.In this section, we generalize our iterative method introduced in Section 3.1 for a market with m assets wherem∈Z+. We model the market as a sequence of i.i.d. price relative vectorsX(n)=[X1(n),…,Xm(n)], whereXi(n)∈Xand the pmf ofXi(n)ispi(x)=Pr(Xi(n)=x). For the m-asset case, the portfolio vector is given byb(n)=[b1(n),…,bm(n)], where∑i=1mbi(n)=1andbi(n)≥0, the target portfolio vector is defined asb=[b1,…,bm]and the threshold vector is given byϵ=[ϵ1,…,ϵm]. Similar to the two-asset case,TRP(b,ϵ)rebalances the wealth allocationb(n)to b only whenb(n)∉bϵ≜(b1−ϵ1,b1+ϵ1)×(b2−ϵ2,b2+ϵ2)×…×(bm−ϵm,bm+ϵm). In this case, if the wealth allocation is not rebalanced for N investment periods, then the achieved wealth is given byS(N)=∑k=1mbk∏n=1NXk(N)and the proportion of wealth invested in the ith asset becomesbi(N)=bi∏n=1NXi(N)∑k=1mbk∏n=1NXk(N). We define the set of achievable portfolios at period N as(21)BN={b}∪{bm,N:bk,N=bm,N−1∘xxTbm,N−1∈bϵ,x∈Xm},whereb∘x≜[b1x1,…,bmxm]Tis an elementwise multiplication operation. In accordance with the definitions given in two-asset market case, the definitions of the portfolio transition sets and the transition probabilities of achievable portfolios follow. Then, similar to the iterative algorithm introduced in Section 3.1, i.e., (15) and (20), we can iteratively calculate the following expected achieved wealth(22)E[S(N)]=∑l=1MNPr(b(N)=bl,N)E[S(N)|b(N)=bl,N].We emphasize that the complete iterations for the m-asset case can be obtained by changing the scalars in (15) and (20) by the corresponding vectors. For the rest of the paper, we consider two-asset markets for ease of exposition.In this section, we investigate the number of achievable portfolios at a given market period to determine the complexity of the iterative algorithm. We show that the set of achievable portfolios at period N is equivalent to the set of achievable portfolios when the portfoliob(n)does not leave the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)for N investment periods. We first demonstrate that if the portfolio never leaves the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)for N periods, thenb(N)is given byb(N)=1/(1+1−bbe∑n=1NZ(n)), whereZ(n)≜ln⁡X2(n)X1(n)with a sample spaceZ≜{z=ln⁡uv|u,v∈X}and|Z|=M. Then, we argue that the number of achievable portfolios at period N, i.e.,MN, is equal to the number of different values that the sum∑n=1NZ(n)can take when the portfolio does not leave the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)for N investment periods. We then observe that we haveM≤K2−K+1as the price relative sequencesX1(n)andX2(n)are elements of the same sample spaceXwith|X|=K. Using this inequality, we finally find an upper bound on the number of achievable portfolios.Lemma 1The number of achievable portfolios at period N, i.e.,MN, is equal to the number of different values that the sum∑n=1NZ(n)can take when the portfoliob(n)does not leave the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)for N investment periods and is bounded by(N+K2−KN), i.e.,MN=|BN|≤(N+K2−KN).ProofThe proof is in Appendix A.  □Remark 1Note that the complexity of calculatingE[S(N)]is bounded byO(∑n=1N(n+K2−Kn)/N)since at each periodn=1,…,N, we calculateE[S(n)]as a summation ofMnterms in (5) andMn≤(n+K2−Kn).As can be observed from Remark 1, the number of achievable portfolios tends to go to the infinity as N increases. However, in the next section, we show that the number of achievable portfolios is finite under mild technical conditions, hence the computational complexity of our algorithm is constant.In this section, we investigate the cardinality of the set of achievable portfoliosB≜⋃n=1∞Bnand demonstrate thatBis finite under certain conditions. Consequently, whenBis finite, we can derive a recursive update with a constant complexity to calculate the expected achieved wealthE[S(n)]at any investment period. To show this, we demonstrate that the portfolio sequence forms a Markov chain with a finite state space and converges to a stationary distribution. Then, we investigate the limiting behavior of the expected achieved wealth using this update to optimize b and ϵ. Before providing the main theorem, we first state a couple of lemmas that are used in the derivation of the main result of this section.We first show that the portfoliob(n)does not leave the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)for N periods iff the sum∑n=1kZ(n)∈(α−,α+)fork=1,…,N, whereα−≜ln⁡b(1−b−ϵ)(1−b)(b+ϵ)<0andα+≜ln⁡b(1−b+ϵ)(1−b)(b−ϵ)>0. We then prove that the number of achievable portfolios is equal to the cardinality of the setY∩(α−,α+), where(23)Y≜{∑i=1M+yizi:yi∈Z,zi∈Z+,i=1,…,M+},Z+≜{z∈Z:z≥0}, andM+≜|Z+|. Note thatZ+is the set of positive elements of the setZand any value that the sum∑n=1NZ(n)can take is an element ofY. Hence, if we can demonstrate that the setY∩(α−,α+)is finite under certain conditions, then it yields that the cardinality of the setBis also finite.Lemma 2The portfoliob(n)does not leave the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)for N investment periods iff the sum∑n=1kZ(n)∈(α−,α+), wherek=1,…,N.ProofThe proof is in Appendix B.  □In the following lemma, we demonstrate that the set of different values that∑n=1NZ(n)can take for anyN∈N, when the portfolio never leaves the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)for N investment periods is equivalent to the setY∩(α−,α+), when|z|<min⁡{|α−|,|α+|}. Hence, we show that the cardinality of the set of achievable portfolios is equal to the cardinality of the setY∩(α−,α+).Lemma 3If|z|<min⁡{|α−|,|α+|},∀z∈Z+, then∀y∈Y∩(α−,α+),∃{Z(n)=Z(n)}n=1N∈Zfor someN∈Nsuch thaty=∑n=1NZ(n)and∑n=1kZ(n)∈(α−,α+),∀k=1,…,N.ProofThe proof is in Appendix C.  □This lemma illustrates that the set of different values that the sum∑n=1NZ(n)can take for anyN∈Nwhen the portfolio does not leave the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)for N investment periods is equivalent to the setY∩(α−,α+). Thus, the number of achievable portfolios is equal to the cardinality of the setY∩(α−,α+). In the following theorem, we demonstrate that if|z|<min⁡{|α−|,|α+|},∀z∈Z+, and the setYhas a minimum positive element, thenY∩(α−,α+)is finite. Hence, the set of achievable portfolios is also finite under these conditions. Otherwise, we show that the setY∩(α−,α+)contains countably infinite elements.Theorem 1If|z|<min⁡{|α−|,|α+|},∀z∈Z+, and the setYhas a minimum positive element, i.e.,∃δ=min⁡{y∈Y:y>0}, then the set of achievable portfoliosB=∪n=1∞Bnis finite. If such a minimum positive element does not exist, thenBis countably infinite.ProofThe proof is in Appendix D.  □In Theorem 1 we present a sufficient and necessary condition for the achievable portfolios to be finite. We emphasize that the required condition, i.e.,|z|<min⁡{|α−|,|α+|},∀z∈Z+, is a necessary required technical condition which assures that the TRP thresholds are large enough to prohibit constant rebalancings at each investment period. In this sense, this condition does not limit the generality of the TRP framework.By Theorem 1, we establish the conditions for a unique stationary distribution of the achievable portfolios. With the existence of a unique stationary distribution, in the next section, we provide the asymptotic behavior of the expected wealth growth by presenting the growth rate. However, before proceeding further, we note that although Theorem 1 states that the number of achievable portfolios is finite under certain conditions, it does not specify the exact number. In the following corollary, we demonstrate that the number of achievable portfolios is⌊α+−α−δ⌋if the set of achievable portfolios is finite.Corollary 1If|z|<min⁡{|α−|,|α+|},∀z∈Z+, and∃δ=min⁡{y∈Y:y>0}, then the number of achievable portfolios is⌊α+−α−δ⌋.11Here,⌊x/y⌋is the largest integer less than or equal tox/yand⌈x/y⌉is the smallest integer greater or equal to thex/y.ProofThe proof is in Appendix E.  □In Theorem 1, we introduce conditions on the cardinality of the set of all achievable portfolio states,B, and showed thatBis finite under certain conditions. Using this result, we next analyze the asymptotic behavior of the expected achieved wealth, i.e., we demonstrate that whenBis finite, the portfolio sequence converges to a stationary distribution. Hence, we can determine the limiting behavior of the expected achieved wealth so that we can optimize b and ϵ. To accomplish this, we first present a recursive update to evaluateE[S(n)]. We then maximize(24)g(b,ϵ)≜limn→∞⁡1nlog⁡E[S(n)]over b and ϵ with a brute-force search, i.e., we calculateg(b,ϵ)for different(b,ϵ)pairs and find the one that yields the maximum expected wealth.WhenBis finite, it follows from Corollary 1 that there are exactlyL≜⌊α+−α−δ⌋achievable portfolios. Then, we letB={b1,…,bL}, whereb1=bwithout loss of generality. We define the probability mass vector of the portfolio sequence asπ(n)=[π1(n),…,πL(n)]Twhereπi(n)≜Pr(b(n)=bi). The portfolio sequenceb(n)forms a homogeneous Markov chain with a finite state spaceBsince the transition probabilities between states are independent of period n. We observe thatb(n)is irreducible since each state communicates with other states so that all states are null-persistent asBis finite [31]. Then, it follows that there exists a unique stationary distribution vectorπ=limn→∞⁡π(n). To calculateπ, we first observe that the set of portfolios from whichbmis achievable, i.e.,Nm,n, and the set of price relative vectors that connectbktobm, i.e.,Uk,m,n, are independent of the investment period n since the price relative sequences are i.i.d.∀k,m∈{1,…,L}. Hence, we drop the subscript n from these terms for ease of exposition and writeUk,m,n=Uk,mandNm,n=Nm,∀n∈N. We next note that the state transition probabilities are also independent of n, hence we also haveqk,m,n=qk,m,∀n∈Nand∀n∈N. Therefore, we can writePr(b(n)=bm)as follows(25)Pr(b(n)=bm)=∑k=1Lqk,mPr(b(n−1)=bk),whereqk,m=0ifbk∉Nm. Now, by using the definition ofπ(n)and (25), we getπ(n+1)=Pπ(n),∀n≥0, where P is the state transition matrix, i.e.,Pij=qi,j.In order to determine the limiting behavior ofE[S(n)], we first define the vectore(n)=[e1(n),…,eL(n)]T, whereei(n)≜Pr(b(n)=bi)×E[S(n)|b(n)=bi]. Then, from (5), we haveE[S(n)]=∑i=1Lei(n)=1Te(n), where 1 is the vector of ones. Hence, according to the definition ofe(n)and using (15) and (20), we can writee(n+1)=Qe(n), where(26)Q≜[∑w∈U1,1κ1⋯∑w∈UL,1κL⋮⋱⋮∑w∈U1,Lκ1⋯∑w∈UL,LκL],andκi≜(biw1+(1−bi)w2)p1(w1)p2(w2), where we ignore rebalancing for presentation purposes. If we take rebalancing into account, then only the first row of Q changes as follows[Q]1,m=∑w∈Vm,1(b1w1+(1−b1)w2)p1(w1)p2(w2)+∑w∈Rm,1(b1w1+(1−b1)w2)×(1−c|b1w1b1w1+(1−b1)w2−b|)p1(w1)p2(w2),whereVm,1is the set of price relative vectors that connectbmtob1=bwithout crossing the threshold boundaries andRm,1is the set of price relative vectors that connectbmtob1=bby crossing the threshold boundaries.22Here,[Q]i,jrepresents the entry of the matrix Q at its ith row and jth column.Here, we analyzeE[S(n)]asn→∞as follows. We assume that the matrix Q is diagonalizable with eigenvaluesλ1,…,λL, where, without loss of generality, we assume thatλL≤…≤λ1, which is the case for a wide range of transaction costs [31]. Then, there exists a nonsingular matrix B such thatQ=BΛB−1where Λ is the diagonal matrix with entriesλ1,…,λL. We observe that Q has nonnegative entries. Therefore, it follows from Perron–Frobenius Theorem [27] that Q has a unique largest eigenvalueλ1>0and any other eigenvalue is strictly smaller thanλ1in absolute value, i.e.,λ1>|λj|,∀j∈{2,…,L}. Then, the recursion one(n)yieldse(n)=Qne(0), andE[S(n)]can be written as follows(27)E[S(n)]=1TQne(0)=1TBΛnB−1e(0)=∑i=1Luiviλin,whereu≜[u1,…,uL]T=BT1andv≜[v1,…,vL]=B−1e(0). Then, it follows that(28)g(b,ϵ)=limn→∞⁡1nlog⁡{∑i=1Luiviλin}=limn→∞⁡log⁡λ1+limn→∞⁡1nlog⁡{∑i=1Luivi(λiλ1)n}=log⁡λ1,sincelimn→∞⁡(λiλ1)n=0,∀i∈{2,…,L}. Hence, we can optimize b and ϵ as follows[b⁎,ϵ⁎]=argmaxb∈[0,1],0<ϵg(b,ϵ)=argmaxb∈[0,1],0<ϵlog⁡λ1.To maximizeg(b,ϵ), we evaluate it for different values of(b,ϵ)pairs and find the pair that maximizesg(b,ϵ), i.e., by a brute-force search in the Simulations section.In the next section, we investigate the well-studied two-asset Brownian market model under transaction costs.In this section, we consider the well-known two-asset Brownian market, where the stock price signals are generated from a standard Brownian motion [11,14,32]. Portfolio selection problem in continuous time two-asset Brownian markets with proportional transaction costs was investigated in [32], where the growth optimal investment strategy is shown to be a threshold portfolio. Here, as usually done in the financial literature [11], we first convert the continuous time Brownian market by sampling to a discrete-time market [14]. We then calculate the expected achieved wealth and optimize b and ϵ to find the best portfolio rebalancing strategy for a discrete-time Brownian market with transaction costs. We emphasize that although, the growth optimal investment in discrete-time two-asset Brownian markets with proportional transaction costs was investigated in [14], the expected achieved wealth and the optimal threshold interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)has not been calculated yet.To model the Brownian two-asset market, we use the price relative vectorX=[X1,X2]T, withX1=1andX2=eaZwhere a is a constant and Z is a random variable withPr(Z=±1)=12. This price relative vector is obtained by sampling the stock price processes of the continuous time two-asset Brownian market [14,32]. We emphasize that this sampling results a discrete-time market identical to the binomial model popular in asset pricing [14]. Under this framework, we next present the set of achievable portfolios and the transition probabilities between portfolio states.Since the price of the first stock is the same over investment periods, the portfolio leaves the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)if either the money in the second stock grows over a certain limit or falls below a certain limit. If the portfoliob(n)does not leave the interval(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)for N investment periods, then the money in the first stock is b dollars and the money in the second stock is(1−b)eakdollars for some−N≤k≤Nso that the portfolio isb(N)=bb+(1−b)eak. Note thatb(N)∈(b−ϵ,b+ϵ)iffkmin≤k≤kmax, wherekmin≜⌈1aln⁡b(1−b−ϵ)(1−b)(b+ϵ)⌉andkmax≜⌊1aln⁡b(1−b+ϵ)(1−b)(b−ϵ)⌋. Hence, the set of achievable portfolios is given by(29)B={bk=bb+(1−b)ea(k+kmin−1):k=1,…,kmax−kmin+1}.For ease of exposition, we denoteB={b1,…,bL}, whereL=|B|=kmax−kmin+1andb1−kmin=b, without loss of generality. We see that the portfolio is rebalanced tob1−kmin=bonly if it is in the stateb1andX2=e−aor it is in the statebLandX2=ea. Therefore, the transition probabilities are given by(30)qk,m={12,if|k−m|=1ork∈{1,L}andm=1−kmin0,otherwise,whereqk,mis the probability that we haveb(n)=bmgiven thatb(n−1)=bkat any period n. We then calculateE[S(n)]using the recursions in Section 3.5 as follows. The sets of price relative vectors that connect portfolio states are given byUk,m={[1,ea]T,ifk∈{1,…,L−1},m=k+1ork=L,m=1−kmin[1,e−a]T,ifk∈{2,…,L},m=k−1ork=1,m=1−kmin∅,otherwise.Hence, we can calculate the matrix Q defined in (26) as follows[Q]m,k={12(bk+(1−bk)ea),ifm∈{2,…,L}andk=m−112(bk+(1−bk)e−a),ifm∈{1,…,L−1}andk=m+10,otherwise,where we ignore rebalancing. If we take rebalancing into account, then we can write[Q]1−imin,1=12(b1+(1−b1)e−a)(1−c|b1b1+(1−b1)e−a−b|),and[Q]1−imin,L=12(bS+(1−bL)ea)(1−c|bLbL+(1−bL)ea−b|).Then, using the recursions in Section 3.5, we can obtainE[S(n)]=Qne(0). Then, we maximizeg(b,ϵ)=limn→∞⁡1nlog⁡E[S(n)]=log⁡λ1, whereλ1is the largest eigenvalue of Q. Here, we optimize b and ϵ with a brute-force search, i.e., we findλ1for different(b,ϵ)pairs and find the one that achieves the maximum.In this section, we sequentially estimate the probability mass vectorsp1andp2corresponding toX1(n)andX2(n), respectively, using a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). In general, these vectors may not be known or may change in time, hence, they should be estimated at each investment period prior to the calculation ofE[S(n)]. The MLE for a pmf on a finite set is well-known [31], but we provide the corresponding derivations here for completeness. We consider the price relative sequence{X1(n)}n=1N, whereX1(n)=wn∈X, forn=1,…,Nis an arbitrary realization of this sequence. Here, our aim is to estimatep1, where we point out that similar derivations follow for the price relative sequenceX2(n)andp2.As demonstrated in our simulations, the corresponding estimation can be carried out over a finite length window to emphasize the most recent data. We letw≜[w1,…,wN]Trepresent the realization vector andθ≜[θx1,…,θxK]Trepresent the parameter vector, whereθxi≜p1(xi|θ)is the conditional pmf fori=1,…,K. Then, the MLE of thep1is given byθˆML=argmax∑i=1Kθxi=1:θxi≥0p1(w|θ)=argmax∑i=1Kθxi=1:θxi≥0Pr(X1(1)=w1,…,X1(N)=wN|θ).Since the price relative sequenceX1(n)is i.i.d., it follows thatp1(w|θ)=∏i=1Np1(wi|θ)=∏i=1Nθwi=∏i=1N∏j=1KθxjI(wi=xj), whereI(⋅)is the indicator function. If we change the order of the product operators, then we obtainp1(w|θ)=∏i=1N∏j=1KθxjI(wi=xj)=∏j=1Kθxj∑i=1NI(wi=xj)=∏j=1KθxjNj, whereNj≜∑i=1NI(wi=xj)represents the number of realizations that are equal toxj∈Xforj=1,…,K. Noting that∑j=1KNj=N, we can writeθˆML=argmaxθ∑j=1KNjNlog⁡θxj, sincelog⁡(⋅)is a monotone increasing function. If we define the vectorh≜[hx1,…,hxK]T, wherehxj≜NjNforj=1,…,K, then we observe thathxj≥0forj=1,…,Kand∑j=1Khxj=1. Since h andθare probability vectors, i.e., their entries are nonnegative and sum up to one, it follows thatD(h‖θ)≜∑i=1Khxjlog⁡(hxjθxj)≥0andD(h‖θ)=0if and only ifθ=h[10]. Therefore, we get that∑j=1Khxjlog⁡θxj=−D(h‖θ)+∑j=1Khxjlog⁡hxj≤∑j=1Khxjlog⁡hxj, where the equality is reached if and only ifθ=h. Hence, it follows thatθˆML=argmaxθ∑j=1Khxjlog⁡θxj=h, i.e., we estimate the probability mass vectorp1withh=[N1N,…,NKN]at each investment period N.In this section, we illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm using historical data. We first compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with respect to the conventional methods using the historical data from [8,19], which is collected from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) over a 22-year period between 1963–1985. This NYSE data includes 34 stocks (where the Kin Ark stock is excluded) and 5651 investment periods (days). We then use the recent S&P 500 data to compare the performances of the our algorithm, state-of-the-art algorithms, and the conventional algorithms. In particular, we consider the Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) – Metlife Inc. (MET), Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) – United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), Fluor Corporation (FLS) – Allegheny Technologies (ATI), Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) – eBay Inc. (EBAY) stock pairs over the period between June 20, 2001 and May 29, 2015 (i.e., 3505 days), and present the average wealth returns. These stocks are chosen since their cumulative returns over the corresponding time interval are between 1–4 dollars per one dollar investment. Finally, we consider the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) data. We use the alphabetically sorted stock pairs of the DJIA data over the period between July 1, 2009 and August 7, 2015, and present the average wealth returns. The proposed algorithms are assumed to be able to trade at the following approximated Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP):0.4×Open+0.6×Close, where “Open” and “Close” are the opening and closing prices of the stocks, respectively. For all our data sets, adjustments were made for splits and dividends.Throughout the experiments, the proposed TRP algorithm is constructed as follows. The algorithm introduced in Section 3.1 requires the sample space of the price relative sequences. This sample space is constructed by quantizing the observed realizations into 11 different bins, where each bin is created according to Theorem 1. We then consider a sliding window of length 100 and approximate the probability mass vectors of the price relative sequences using the past data for each window. The proposed TRP algorithm constructs its trading rule by maximizing the expected achieved wealth over b and ϵ according to the discussions in Section 3.5, and we invest using this TRP for each window.We compare the performance of the proposed TRP algorithm with respect to the state-of-the-art and conventional methods. These competitor algorithms can be briefly described as follows.•Cover is the Cover's universal portfolio algorithm in [8]. In this method, the wealth is distributed among various stocks according to their wealth returns.SCRP is the semiconstant rebalanced portfolio algorithm of [19]. In this method, portfolio is rebalanced only on selected instants to mitigate the effects of transaction costs.Iyengar is the universal threshold rebalanced portfolio algorithm of [15]. In this method, the wealth is distributed among various target portfolio and threshold pairs according to their wealth returns.CWMR is the confidence weighted mean reversion algorithm of [22]. In this method, the portfolio is modeled as a Gaussian distribution and trading is performed using the mean reversion principle.OLMAR is the online portfolio selection with moving average reversion algorithm of [23]. This method is based on a multiple-period mean reversion strategy.Anticor is the anti-correlation algorithm of [5]. This method uses the predictable statistical relations between stocks to beat the best stock in the market.M0 is the Markov of order zero algorithm of [4]. This method uses the add-beta prediction rule on the Kelly projections of the market vectors.In Figs. 2 and 3, we present the average wealth returns of the TRP, Cover, SCRP, and Iyengar algorithms over 10 randomly chosen stock pairs from the NYSE data under 1% and 2% transaction costs, respectively. These figures illustrate that the proposed TRP algorithm significantly outperforms the competitor algorithms and achieve higher wealth returns. Since the TRP algorithm aims to mitigate the effects of hefty transaction costs, its performances is not significantly affected by a change in the commission rate. The proposed TRP algorithm achieves this robustness by avoiding excessive rebalancings. Although the SCRP and Iyengar algorithms are also robust against transaction costs, the TRP algorithm provides a better performance since it directly aims to maximize the expected achieved wealth.We next compare the performance of the proposed TRP algorithm with respect to the state-of-the-art algorithms using the recent S&P 500 data. In Figs. 4 and 5, we have presented the wealth returns of the proposed algorithms for transaction costs of 0.03% and 0.1%, respectively. As shown in these figures, the proposed TRP algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitor algorithms and achieve the highest final wealth returns. For this experiment, we also provide the Sharpe, Calmar, and Sortino ratios of the proposed algorithms in Table 1, where the values in the table are found according to the model described in [21,22]. This table illustrates that the proposed TRP algorithm achieves the highest reward-to-variability ratios. Furthermore, as the transaction cost increases, the Sharpe ratio of our algorithm does not significantly decrease, whereas the Sharpe ratios of the competitor algorithms notably decreases. This illustrates the robustness of the proposed algorithm against transaction costs. Since the proposed algorithm optimizes its trading model with respect to a given transaction cost, the risk of the algorithm does not vary excessively.Although the transaction costs in Figs. 4 and 5 are realistic for institutional trading, the transaction costs for retail trading are around 1–3%. Since these state-of-the-art algorithms does not optimize their trading model according to the transaction cost, their returns tend to go to zero as the transaction cost exceeds 1%. Thus, we have compared the performance of our algorithm with respect to only the conventional trading algorithms for 3% transaction cost in Fig. 6. For mild transaction costs (such as the ones in Figs. 4 and 5), the final wealth return of the TRP algorithm is around 5.25 dollars per one dollar investment. On the other hand, for a hefty transaction cost (such as the one in Fig. 6), the total wealth return of the TRP algorithm is around 4.75 dollars per one dollar investment. This illustrates that although the state-of-the-art trading algorithms cannot provide a reasonable wealth return for such hefty transaction costs, the performance of the proposed TRP algorithm is not significantly deteriorated as the transaction cost increases.We also provide the wealth returns of the proposed TRP algorithm and the conventional algorithms under no transaction cost over the S&P 500 data for a fair comparison. Fig. 7illustrates that the algorithms that consider the effects of transaction cost on the wealth return, namely the TRP, SCRP, and Iyengar algorithms, provide similar returns for different transaction costs. On the other hand, the performances of the algorithms that do not take transaction cost into account (e.g., the Cover algorithm) are highly volatile with respect to the transaction cost. Although the returns of the SCRP and Iyengar algorithms are not significantly affected by the transaction cost, the proposed TRP algorithm outperforms these methods for both no transaction cost and 3% transaction cost cases.Finally, in Fig. 8, we present the average wealth returns of the TRP, CWMR, M0, Anticor, and OLMAR algorithms under1%transaction cost. As can be seen from this figure, the TRP algorithm provides a superior performance with respect to the competitor algorithms that do not consider the effects of transaction costs. This result highlights the importance of designing portfolio optimization algorithms that avoid excessive number of rebalancings when the transaction cost is high. In Fig. 9, we present the average wealth returns of the TRP, Iyengar, Cover, and SCRP algorithms under0.5%transaction cost. Although the performances of the proposed algorithms are comparable with one another since the transaction cost is small, the TRP algorithm still provides a marginally higher return with respect to the competitor algorithms.
