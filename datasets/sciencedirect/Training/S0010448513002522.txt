@&#ABSTRACT@&#
According to the characteristics of the coordinates and phases in 2D CAD engineering graphics, difference histograms are constructed. Consequently, two reversible watermarking schemes based on difference histogram shifting are put forward. The first scheme HS_C implements the integer part of coordinate values to construct the adjacent difference histogram and hides messages in the peak and zero point pairs. The scheme can achieve high capacity and good invisibility in the graphics with high correlated coordinates. Instead of coordinates, the second scheme HS_P adopts the integer part of the phase value as the cover data, and the watermark is embedded by shifting and modifying the difference histogram of the phase. It is robust against translation, rotation and even scaling. Experimental results show that both schemes are strictly reversible. The proposed schemes have great potential to be applied for content authentication or secret communication of 2D CAD engineering graphics.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the rapid development of digital technology and multimedia network, much attention has been paid to the information security of the data transported over the network. Among these existing security mechanisms, watermarking technology has been widely used for copyright protection, content authentication and secret communication, etc. According to the application purpose, watermarking techniques can be classified into robust watermarking and fragile watermarking. Robust watermarking is usually focused on protecting ownership, which must robustly survive after attacks, while fragile watermarking intents to authenticate integrity. 2D CAD engineering graphics is a kind of vector graphics and has its own characteristics. Unlike highly correlated multimedia data whose relative positions are fixed, the entities of graphics are independent and their elements are different. In addition, geometric information and topology information are equally important. Furthermore, there is little redundancy in 2D CAD engineering graphics. Hence watermark embedding should be more difficult compared with raster images, audio, video, etc. Recently, some works have been done to the copyright protection and content authenticity of 2D vector graphics by using digital watermarking. However, since some traditional watermarking technologies brought permanent distortion to the host, they are not suitable for 2D CAD engineering graphics, which imposes strict requirements on data integrity and authenticity due to their applications in product manufacturing, medical diagnosis and judicial authentication. Fortunately, reversible watermarking is proposed to meet the needs of these applications. Reversible watermarking is also known as lossless data hiding, and it can completely recover the original data after the watermark extraction, which has no negative effect on the availability of the original carrier  [1].Currently, reversible watermarking has been widely investigated. Generally speaking, the basic principle of reversible watermarking relies on reversible algebraic or geometric operations, such as difference expansion  [2], lossless compression  [3] and histogram shifting  [4–10]. However, the existing methods are mainly focused on raster images  [2–8]. Histogram shifting is a typical reversible technique, which was first proposed for raster images by Z. Ni et al.  [4]. It was carried out by shifting the zero and peak point pair of an image histogram and it obtained low computational complexity and high quality of watermarked image. Thereafter, G. Xuan et al.  [5] and X. Wu  [6] proposed reversible watermarking by using histogram shifting schemes based on integer wavelet transform, and both achieved high embedding capacity and good imperceptibility. After that, histogram shifting techniques based on prediction error are put forward in  [7–9], and a reversible watermark scheme combining pre-processing operation and histogram shifting is presented in  [10]. As a result, the capacity is considerably enhanced. Since the differences between raster images and vector graphics are varied from data element to data correlation, histogram shifting techniques cannot be directly used for 2D CAD engineering graphics. In this paper, an improvement is done to  [7], and consequently two reversible watermarking schemes for 2D CAD engineering graphics are proposed.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: related works are introduced in Section  2; introduction of histogram shifting and its improvement are presented in Section  3; the proposed reversible watermarking schemes are described in detail in Section  4; experimental results and analysis are performed in Section  5; finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section  6.
