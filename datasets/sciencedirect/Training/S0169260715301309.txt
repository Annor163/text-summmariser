Impact of a computerized provider radiography order entry system without clinical decision support on emergency department medical imaging requests

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The main objective of this study was to investigate the impact of implementing a computer-based order entry system without clinical decision support on the number of radiographs ordered for patients seen in the emergency department.Our results show a decrease in the number of radiographs ordered after computer-based order entry system implementation, despite an increase in the number of emergency department admissions.Our study also shows that the time interval between emergency department admission and medical imaging was not affected by this new workflow.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Background and objectiveThe adoption of computerized physician order entry is an important cornerstone of using health information technology (HIT) in health care. The transition from paper to computer forms presents a change in physicians’ practices. The main objective of this study was to investigate the impact of implementing a computer-based order entry (CPOE) system without clinical decision support on the number of radiographs ordered for patients admitted in the emergency department.MethodsThis single-center pre-/post-intervention study was conducted in January, 2013 (before CPOE period) and January, 2014 (after CPOE period) at the emergency department at Nîmes University Hospital. All patients admitted in the emergency department who had undergone medical imaging were included in the study.ResultsEmergency department admissions have increased since the implementation of CPOE (5388 in the period before CPOE implementation vs. 5808 patients after CPOE implementation, p=.008). In the period before CPOE implementation, 2345 patients (44%) had undergone medical imaging; in the period after CPOE implementation, 2306 patients (40%) had undergone medical imaging (p=.008). In the period before CPOE, 2916 medical imaging procedures were ordered; in the period after CPOE, 2876 medical imaging procedures were ordered (p=.006). In the period before CPOE, 1885 radiographs were ordered; in the period after CPOE, 1776 radiographs were ordered (p<.001). The time between emergency department admission and medical imaging did not vary between the two periods.ConclusionsOur results show a decrease in the number of radiograph requests after a CPOE system without clinical decision support was implemented in our emergency department.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Our results show a decrease in the number of radiograph orders after a CPOE system without CDS was implemented in our ED. Further studies are needed to analyze and understand the mechanisms and the consequences of this decrease.The study was performed in compliance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. This study was reviewed and approved by our institutional review board. Moreover, this present study was approved by the National Commission for Data Processing and Civil Liberties (CNIL). According to the French Law (Law 88-1138 pertaining to Biomedical Research of 20 December 1988 modified on 9 August 2004), this non-interventional study did was exempt of informed signed consent from patients.The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest in the research.
