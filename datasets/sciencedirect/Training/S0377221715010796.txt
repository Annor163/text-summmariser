The cost of getting local monotonicity

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We study convex combinations of power indices and the possible violation of local monotonicity.Our approach can be seen as a general method for the designing of power indices with specified properties.If local monotonicity is not violated, then the ratio of the Public Good index has to be rather small.Our study gives some insight on the differences between certain power indices.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Committees with yes-no-decisions are commonly modeled as simple games and the ability of a member to influence the group decision is measured by so-called power indices. For a weighted game we say that a power index satisfies local monotonicity if a player who controls a large share of the total weight vote does not have less power than a player with a smaller voting weight.In (Holler, 1982) Manfred Holler introduced the Public Good index. In its unnormalized version, i.e., the raw measure, it counts the number of times that a player belongs to a minimal winning coalition. Unlike the Banzhaf index, it does not count the remaining winning coalitions in which the player is crucial. Holler noticed that his index does not satisfy local monotonicity, a fact that can be seen either as a major drawback (Felsenthal & Machover, 1998, 221 ff.)or as an advantage (Holler & Napel 2004).In this paper we consider a convex combination of the two indices and require the validity of local monotonicity. We prove that the cost of obtaining it is high, i.e., the achievable new indices satisfying local monotonicity are closer to the Banzhaf index than to the Public Good index. All these achievable new indices are more solidary than the Banzhaf index, which makes them as very suitable candidates to divide a public good.As a generalization we consider convex combinations of either: the Shift index, the Public Good index, and the Banzhaf index, or alternatively: the Shift Deegan–Packel, Deegan–Packel, and Johnston indices.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Consider a set of players who jointly make decisions under a given set of rules. Here we specialize to simple games and subclasses thereof. Power indices address the question of how much power collective decision rules, like a weighted (voting) rule, award to each individual player: is player i more or less powerful than player j, and by how much? For an example of an applied voting power analysis in the EU, we refer the interested reader to e.g. Algaba, Bilbao, and Fernández (2007); Bilbao, Fernández, Jiménez, and López (2002); Widgrén (1994). Different power indices measure different aspects of power and there is still a lot of research in order to answer the question which index to choose, see, e.g., Holler and Nurmi (2013). For a recent overview of different power indices see, e.g., Bertini, Freixas, Gambarelli, and Stach (2013). Many of these indices are based on decisiveness. A player is called critical in a coalition if his/her deletion in the coalition changes its status from winning to losing, so that the individual is decisive or crucial for it. All power indices, the classical and the newly introduced ones, considered in this paper are indeed based on counting different types of decisiveness for players in coalitions.Some particular decision rules arise from so-called weighted games. Here each playeri∈{1,⋯,n}has a specific voting weight wiand a collective decision requires enough supporters such that their total weight equals or surpasses a decision quota q. Let pibe the power value assigned to player i by a power index. The power index is called locally monotonic if, for each pair of players i and j, wi≥ wjimplies pi≥ pj, i.e., a player i who controls a large share of vote does not have less power than a player j with smaller voting weight. Local monotonicity is considered as an essential requirement for power measures by many authors. Felsenthal and Machover (1998, 221 ff.), for instance, argue that any a priori measure of power that violates local monotonicity, LM for brevity, is ‘pathological’ and should be disqualified as serving as a valid yardstick for measuring power. On the other hand, e.g. in Holler and Napel (2004), it is argued that local non-monotonicity is a very valuable property of a power index, since it can reveal certain properties of the underlying decision rule that are overlooked otherwise.Local monotonicity is an implication of the dominance postulate which is based on the desirability relation as proposed by Isbell (1958). This property formalizes that a player i is at least as desirable as a player j if for any coalition S, such that j is not in S and the union of S and {j} is a winning coalition, i.e., is able to pass the collective decision at hand, the union of S and {i} is also a winning coalition. A power index satisfies dominance if pi≥ pjwhenever i dominates j, i.e., when player i is at least as desirable as player j.Freixas and Gambarelli (1997) use desirability to define reasonable power measures and note that the dominance postulate implies local monotonicity. In this paper we will consider the Public Good, the Banzhaf, the Shift, the Shift Deegan–Packel, the Deegan–Packel, the Johnston index and convex combinations thereof. Since the Deegan–Packel index (Deegan & Packel, 1978), and the Public Good index (see Holler, 1982; Holler and Packel, 1983) violate local monotonicity, they also violate the dominance postulate. Moreover, any violation of local monotonicity for the Deegan–Packel index implies a violation of the Shift Deegan–Packel index (see Alonso-Meijide, Freixas, & Molinero, 2012) and any violation of the local monotonicity for the Public Good index implies a violation of the Shift index (see Alonso-Meijide & Freixas, 2010). It is well-known that the Banzhaf (1965) and Johnston (1978) indices satisfy the dominance postulate and therefore local monotonicity. If one or several power indices violate LM then a convex combination with another power index, that does not violate LM, yields a power index that also does not violate LM as long as the weight of the latter index is large enough. To study how large this has to be is the purpose of this paper.Some works are devoted to verify the properties of dominance or local monotonicity (among others) for some power indices and to show their absence for some other power indices (see among others, Felsenthal and Machover (1995) or Freixas, Marciniak, and Pons (2012)). Other works are devoted to study subclasses of games for which a given power index not fulfilling local monotonicity satisfies it for such a subclass of games (see for instance, Holler, Ono, and Steffen (2001) and Holler and Napel (2004) for the Public Good index). Here we will also make a new contribution of this type, i.e., we consider two new subclasses of games for which the Public Good index satisfies local monotonicity.Proportionality of power and weights can be seen as a generalization of local monotonicity, i.e., proportionality implies local monotonicity. For the classical power indices this property is satisfied for a subset of weighted games only. Power indices which generally satisfy this property are constructed in Kaniovski and Kurz (2015).In this paper we modify the Public Good index with the purpose to achieve a set of new power indices being local monotonic and more solidary than the Banzhaf index. These two properties make those achievable power indices (if they exist) well-situated as yardstick for doing a fair division of a public good. The idea of such modification is nothing else than an hybrid between the original Public Good index and the Banzhaf index. It will turn out that the cost of obtaining local monotonicity is rather high, i.e., the achievable new indices satisfying local monotonicity are closer to the Banzhaf index than to the Public Good index. However, these indices stress more in minimal winning coalitions, as the Public Good index does, than in the rest of crucial winning coalitions, with goes in the direction of Riker’s size principle (Riker, 1962). The final result allows to find new indices being locally monotonic and being more solidary than the Banzhaf index, which makes them as good alternatives for the fair division of a public good among participants in the voting procedure.The idea developed previously naturally extends when the raw Shift index is incorporated to the duo formed by the raw Public Good and raw Banzhaf indices. Local monotonic indices which are convex combinations of the three given raw indices are a further target of our research.As an extension we do a similar study for convex combinations of the raw Johnston index, the raw Deegan–Packel index, and the raw Shift Deegan–Packel index.The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the basic notation of games and power indices. Two subclasses of weighted games satisfying local monotonicity are presented in Section 3. The concept of considering convex combinations of some power indices as a new power index is outlined in Section 4. The cost of local monotonicity is introduced in the same section. Additionally we prove some structural results. An integer linear programming approach to compute the cost of local monotonicity is presented in Section 5. With the aid of the underlying algorithm we are able to state some exact values and lower bounds for the cost of local monotonicity in Section 6. The set of all convex multipliers leading to a locally monotonic power index is the topic of Section 7. We end with a conclusion in Section 8.In the following we will denote the set of players, which jointly make a decision, by N and assume w.l.o.g. that the players are numbered from 1 to n, i.e.,N={1,⋯,n}. Here we restrict ourselves to binary decisions, i.e., each player can either vote 1, meaning ‘yes’, or 0, meaning ‘no’, on a certain issue. For the readers convenience we collect all necessary definitions briefly at this place. For a more extensive introduction we refer to Felsenthal and Machover (1998), Taylor and Zwicker (1999).We call a subset S⊆N, collecting the ‘yes’-voters, coalition. A (binary) decision rule is formalized as a mapping v: 2N→ {0, 1} from the set of possible coalitions to the set of possible aggregated decisions. It is quite natural to require that the aggregated decision transfers the players decision if they all coincide and that an enlarged set of supporters should not turn the decision from ‘yes’ to ‘no’:Definition 1A simple game is a mapping v: 2N→ {0, 1} such thatv(∅)=0,v(N)=1,and v(S) ≤ v(T) for all S ⊆ T ⊆ N.Having local monotonicity in mind we additionally require that the players are linearly ordered according to their capabilities to influence the final group decision. This can be formalized, as already indicated in the introduction, with the desirability relation introduced in Isbell (1958). Intuitively, the dominance (or desirability) relation is an attempt to formalize the intuitive notion that underlies under the expression:‘i has at least as power than j’, while the equivalence between i and j formalizes the expression ‘i and j have the same power’.Definition 2We write i ⊐ j (or j ⊏ i) for two players i, j ∈ N of a simple game v if we havev({i}∪S∖{j})≥v(S)for all {j} ⊆ S ⊆ N\{i} and we abbreviate i ⊐ j, j ⊐ i by i □ j.In words we say that i dominates j for i⊐j and we say that i and j are equivalent for i□j.Definition 3A simple game v is called complete if the binary relation ⊐ is a total preorder, i.e.,(1)i⊐i for all i ∈ N,i⊐j or j⊐i for all i, j ∈ N, andi⊐j, j⊐h implies i⊐h for all i, j, h ∈ N.We call a coalition S of a simple game v winning ifv(S)=1and losing otherwise. Each simple game is uniquely characterized by its setWof winning coalitions (or its setLof losing coalitions). A winning coalition S such that each of its proper subsets is losing is called a minimal winning coalition. The setMof minimal winning coalitions is already sufficient to uniquely characterize a simple game. For complete games the defining set of winning coalitions can be further reduced. A minimal winning coalition S is called shift-minimal if for each pair of players i, j with i ∈ S, j ∉ S, i⊐j,j¬⊐iwe havev(S∖{i}∪{j})=0,i.e., replacing a player by a (properly) dominated player turns the coalition into a losing one. With this, each complete game is uniquely characterized by its setSof shift-minimal winning coalitions.A very transparent form of dominance is induced by weights.Definition 4A simple game v is called weighted (weighted game for brevity) if and only if there exist weightswi∈R≥0,for all i ∈ N, and a quotaq∈R>0such thatv(S)=1is equivalent to w(S) ≔ ∑i ∈ Swi≥ q for all S⊆N.LetN={1,2,3,4,5,6}be the set of players of a game, withN1={1,2}andN2={3,4,5,6}forming a partition of N. Let a be an arbitrary player of N1 and c and d arbitrary players of N2. The set of minimal winning coalitions,M,is formed by coalitions of the two following types: {1, 2, c} and {a, c, d}. Observe that: (i) players in N1 are equivalent and the same occurs for the players in N2, (ii) players in N1 dominate players in N2, and (iii) the simple game defined is not weighted, this can be deduced by observing that {1, 3, 4} and {2, 5, 6} are winning coalitions while {1, 2} and {3, 4, 5, 6} are losing ones. If the game was weighted and wifor alli=1,⋯,6were the weights, then the two next inequalities should be truew1+w3+w4>w1+w2,w2+w5+w6>w3+w4+w5+w6but the sum of them leads to another incompatible inequality. Note, moreover, that in this game the 12 minimal winning coalitions of type {a, c, d} are shift-minimal winning, while the 4 minimal winning coalitions of type {1, 2, c} are not.Given such a weighted representation we writev=[q;w1,⋯,wn]. All weighted games are complete. As remarked before wi≥ wjimplies that player i dominates player j, i.e., i⊐j, while i□j is still possible even for wi> wj. That is, having more weight does not necessarily imply having more influence in the game. i□j implies that the roles of the two players in the game are symmetrical. A standard example in which all players are equivalent but have different weight is the weighted game with weighted representation [51; 49, 48, 3]. However, it is well-known that if i□j but wi> wjin a game, then there is an equivalent weighted representation for the game that respects the equivalence relation.In order to measure the influence of the players we use the concept of a power index, which we in general consider as a mapping from a setGof games to a vector of n real numbers, where n is the number of players of the specific game. In most applications, considering subsets of the set of simple games, the image is a vector of n non-negative real numbers upper bounded by 1. To this end we denote bySthe set of simple games, byCthe set of complete games, and byWthe set of weighted games. In order to stress the underlying class of games, we speak of a power index P onG, whenever it is not clear from the context.In some contexts it is appropriate to further restrict the class of games:Definition 5A simple game is called proper if the complement N\S of any winning coalition S is losing. It is called strong if the complement N\S of any losing coalition S is winning. A simple game that is both proper and strong is called constant-sum (or self-dual).We will denote the restriction to proper, strong, or constant-sum games by a superscriptp,s,andc,respectively, i.e., we writeSp,Ss,andScin the case of simple games. If P is a power index onG,then there is a restricted power index P′ onG′for allG′⊆G,i.e., we just restrict the domain of the given mapping.Having the general concept of a power index P onGat hand, i.e.,P(v)=(P1(v),⋯,Pn(v))=(p1,⋯,pn)∈Rn,we can define the properties that we are interested in this paper:Definition 6A power index P onG⊆Csatisfies the dominance property if we have pi≥ pjfor all complete gamesv∈Gand all pairs of players i⊐j, whereP(v)=(p1,⋯,pn).Restricting the dominance property from the class of complete games to weighted games, we speak of local monotonicity.Definition 7A power index P onG⊆Wsatisfies local monotonicity (LM) if we have pi≥ pjfor all weighted gamesv∈Gand all pairs of players i⊐j (or wi≥ wj), whereP(v)=(p1,⋯,pn).We remark that the dominance property for the subclass of weighted games implies local monotonicity and local monotonicity implies symmetry, i.e., we havepi=pjfor all i□j. Further properties of classical power indices were named and studied in the literature and are here grouped together in the next definition. Recall first that a player i is null in a simple game, if the player does not belong to any minimal winning coalition. Removing a null player from a simple game (complete game or weighted game) v results in a simple game (complete game or weighted game) v′ – more formally v′ ≔ 2N\{i} → {0, 1}v′(S)=v(S)for all S⊆N\{i}.Definition 8A power index P onS:(i) is non-negative if P(v) ≥ 0 for allv∈S,(ii) is efficient if it is non-negative and∑i=1npi(v)=1for allv∈S,(iii) satisfies the null player property ifpi(v)=0whenever i is a null player inv∈S,(iv) is strictly positive if pi(v) > 0 for all non-null players i andpi(v)=0for all null players i, for allv∈S,(v) is invariant for nulls ifpj=pj′for all j ∈ N\{i} andpi=0,whereP(v)=(p1,⋯,pn)andP(v′)=(p1′,⋯,pi−1′,pi+1′,⋯,pn′).In order to state the definition for the set of power indices mentioned in the introduction we call a winning coalition S critical for player i ∈ S if S\{i} is losing. Given a simple game v, byDiwe denote the set of coalitions {i}⊆S⊆N being critical for player i. Similarly, we denote byMithe set of minimal winning coalitions containing player i and bySithe set of shift-minimal winning coalitions containing player i (provided that the game is complete). In order to specify a power index P it suffices to define the mapping for each coordinatePi(v)=pi.The next two definitions concern particular power indices. We mainly focus on “raw” power indices because the results in the paper do not depend on normalizations.Definition 9The (raw) Banzhaf indexBzrand the (raw) Public Good indexPGIrof a simple game v are given byBzir(v)=|Di|andPGIir(v)=|Mi|for each player i. The (raw) Shift index of a complete game v is given bySir(v)=|Si|.(Chow, (1961)) introduced, in the field of threshold logic, some parameters for all simple games. These parameters aren+1numbers: the number of winning coalitions to which a player belongs to and the number of winning coalitions. The raw Banzhaf index is nothing else thatBzir(v)=2|Mi|−|M|. Thanks to this relation many properties were derived for the raw Banzhaf index. We address the interested reader to Section 12 in Dubey (1979).The (raw) Banzhaf indexBzr,the (raw) Public Good indexPGIr,and the (raw) Shift indexSrall are based on critical coalitions since they count subsets of critical coalitions containing a given player i. The Banzhaf index counts all critical coalitions for each player, while the Public Good index counts only the minimal and the Shift index only the shift-minimal ones. Thus, for each player we have the inclusionSi⊆Mi⊆Di.Several power indices are based on counting a certain subset of coalitions (Kurz, 2014). As defined, several coalitions can be counted multiple times, e.g., a minimal winning coalition S is counted for every player i contained in S in the computation ofPGIr. If one wants to avoid this characteristic and instead count each distinguished coalition just once, then one can divide ‘spoils’ of each coalition equally among its critical members. This general construction is called equal division version of a given power index (based on counting functions) (Kurz, 2014). Applying this construction on our first set of power indices we obtain the following.Definition 10The (raw) Johnston indexJorand the (raw) Deegan–Packel indexDProf a simple game v are given byJoir(v)=∑S∈Di1#criticalplayersinSandDPir(v)=∑S∈Mi1|S|. The (raw) Shift Deegan–Packel index of a complete game v is given bySDPir(v)=∑S∈Si1|S|.Note that in the two last definitions the cardinality of S is the same as the number of critical players in S, since all players in minimal winning (or in shift-minimal winning) coalitions are critical in them.As it is well-known the Banzhaf and the Johnston indices (and the Shapley–Shubik too) satisfy both the dominance property and local monotonicity since all of them preserve the desirability relation (see, e.g., Freixas et al., 2012). The other power indices previously introduced in Section 2 and extensively analyzed in this paper do not preserve the desirability relation and consequently fail to fulfill both the dominance and the local monotonicity properties (see e.g., Felsenthal and Machover, 1998; Freixas and Gambarelli, 1997; Freixas et al., 2012).The purpose of this section is to provide subclasses of games precisely defined in next definition satisfying the dominance property or the local-monotonicity for the Public Good and the Deegan–Packel indices.Definition 11A simple game is:1.uniform if all minimal winning coalitions have the same cardinality,uniform complete if it is both complete and uniform,uniform weighted if it is both weighted and uniform.As an abbreviation we denote the corresponding subclasses byU,Uc,andUw,respectively. Obviously, a uniform weighted game is a uniform complete game and a uniform complete game is a uniform game, while the converses are not true.The second observation is that if a game is uniform then all shift-minimal winning coalitions have the same cardinality becauseS⊆Mfor all simple game. However the converse is also true, i.e., if all shift-minimal winning coalitions have the same cardinality then all the minimal winning coalitions have the same cardinality too. This is because the coalitions inM∖Sare obtained from those inSby one-to-one replacements of weaker players, according to the desirability relation, for stronger players; but these exchanges do not affect the cardinalities of the coalitions involved. Hence, we can exchange in previous definition the term “minimal winning coalition” by “shift-minimal winning coalition”.If l is the cardinality of all minimal winning coalitions in a uniform game, in any of its forms, thenM=M(l)whereM(l)is the set of minimal winning coalitions of cardinality l.Despite the restrictive definition of uniform complete games, their number grow exponentially in the number of players. For instance, there are (see, e.g., Freixas & Puente, 2008; Kurz & Tautenhahn, 2013)2n−1uniform complete games with just one type of shift-minimal winning coalitions of n players. Table 1provides enumerations for small values of n on the number of uniform complete games (Uc) and uniform weighted games (Uw). Forn=10players the number of uniform complete games is given by 3 049 712 101 and forn=11players the respective number larger than 25 × 1012. Without considering symmetry the number of uniform simple games with n players is given by∑k=1n2(nk)−1.Proposition 1Let v be a uniform complete game, characterized byWand N, then the Public Good and Deegan–Packel indices satisfy the dominance property.As the game is a uniform complete game, it holds:DPir=PGIir/lfor all i ∈ N, wherel=min{|S|:S∈W},so it suffices to prove the statement for the Public Good index.Assume i⊐j, then for all S⊆N∖{i, j} withS∪{j}∈Mwe haveS∪{i}∈W. IfS∪{i}∉M,then there would exist a player k ∈ S such that(S∪{i})∖{k}∈W,but|(S∪{i})∖{k}|=|S∪{j}|−1=l−1,which is a contradiction with the fact that all minimal winning coalitions have the same size. Thus,S∪{i}∈Mand thereforePGIir=|Mi|≥|Mj|=PGIjr.□We remark that i⊐j,i¬⊐jimpliesPGIir>PGIjr.Corollary 1The Public Good and Deegan–Packel indices satisfy dominance and local monotonicity properties on the classesUcandUw,respectively.As a consequence, for uniform complete games the ranking given by the desirability relation coincides with the rankings given by Public Good and Deegan–Packel indices. So these rankings also coincide with the rankings of the Shapley–Shubik, Banzhaf, and Johnston indices because these indices also satisfy dominance, see Freixas et al. (2012).It is remarkable to note that there are previous studies done on studying subclasses of weighted games satisfying local monotonicity for the Public Good index. However, these led to subclasses whose cardinalities grow polynomially on the number of players, see Holler and Napel (2004). (To be more precise, these subclasses are based on the addition of null players to some games with few players satisfying local monotonicity.) Nevertheless, the work we develop in next sections illustrates that local monotonicity is hardly achievable for the Public Good index if we choose a game at random with a large number of voters. Notwithstanding of this fact we think it is noteworthy the identification of subclasses of simple games satisfying the dominance property, for several power indices, with exponential growth on the number of players. Although compared with other subclasses of games the (exponential) growth of uniform complete games may seem limited.The Public Good and the Deegan–Packel indices are locally monotonic for uniform games. However, this condition is not necessary as the following example illustrates.Example 2Let v be the 4-player game uniquely characterized byN={1,2,3,4}andM={{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{2,3,4}},i.e., v admits the weighted representation [3; 2, 1, 1, 1]. This game is the unique weighted game of 4 players which is not uniform but it satisfies the dominance property and so the local monotonicity property for the Public Good index.At the very least, the game of Example 2 is captured by the following two definitions.Definition 12Let v be a simple game with player setN={1,⋯,n},i≿jifandonlyif∑l=1k|Mi(l)|≥∑l=1k|Mj(l)|forallk=1,2,⋯,n.Then the layer relation, ≿, is a preordering on N, i.e., a reflexive and transitive relation.Definition 13A simple game v on N is flat whenever ≿, the layer relation on N, is total.Thus, in a flat simple game, we either have i≿j or j≿i for all i, j ∈ N. Nevertheless the subclass of uniform games has been presented separately by its: simpler structure and easier identification and enumeration.We remark that i⊐j,i¬⊐jimpliesDPir>DPjr. Note further that uniform games are particular cases of flat games, for which the mentioned implication is not valid in general.Proposition 2Let v be a flat complete game, characterized byWand N, then the Public Good and Deegan–Packel indices satisfy the dominance property.As v is a complete game it is either i⊐j or j⊐i for all i, j ∈ N. Assume from now on i⊐j.As v is flat, either i≿j or j≿i for all i, j ∈ N. We shall see that i⊐j implies i≿j.If i□j, then|Mi(h)|=|Mj(h)|for allh=1,⋯,nwhich implies i≿j.Ifj¬⊐i,let h be the smallest value such that|Mi(h)|≠|Mj(h)|,as i⊐j it must be|Mi(h)|>|Mj(h)|,otherwise we would have a contradiction with the definition of the desirability relation. This inequality implies i≿j since j≿i would be incompatible with it.Now it lacks to prove that i≿j impliesPGIir≥PGIjrandDPir≥DPjr,but sincePGIir=∑l=1n|Mi(l)|≥∑l=1n|Mj(l)|=PGIjrthe statement is true for the public Good index, and sinceDPir=1l∑l=1n|Mi(l)|we have the decomposition:(1)DPir−DPjr=(1−12)(∑l=11|Mi(l)|−∑l=11|Mj(l)|)+(12−13)(∑l=12|Mi(l)|−∑h=12|Mj(l)|)+⋯+(1n−1−1n)(∑l=1n−1|Mi(l)|−∑h=1n−1|Mj(l)|)+1n(∑h=1n|Mi(l)|−∑h=1n|Mj(l)|).As v is flat, each addend is non-negative, i.e.,DPir≥DPjr.□Let v be the weighted game uniquely characterized byN={1,2,3}andM={{1},{2,3}}. This is a flat game with 1⊐2,2¬⊐1,and 2□3. The (normalized) Public Good index is given by13·(1,1,1),i.e., player 1 and player 2 obtain the same value while not being equivalent. The (normalized) Deegan–Packel index is given by14·(2,1,1).The Public Good and Deegan–Packel indices satisfy local monotonicity on the class of weighted flat games.As mentioned in the introduction one of the aims of this paper is to study power indices arising as a convex combination of a given (finite) collection of power indices. To this end letPbe a finite set of power indices, e.g.P={Bzr,PGIr}orP={Bzr,PGIr,Sr},which we will use later on. Given a setP={P1,⋯,Pr}of power indices we consider the convex combinationsPα,P=∑h=1rαh·Ph,whereα=(α1,⋯,αr)is contained in the r-dimensional unit cube [0, 1]rand∑h=1rαh=1,that is α belongs to the r-dimensional simplexSr:={x∈[0,1]r∣∥x∥1=1}. The power indices Phare defined on possibly different classesGhand we setG=∩h=1rGh. ObviouslyPα,Pis a power index onGtoo, i.e., it maps games inGto a vector inRn. In the remaining part of the paper we will not explicitly mention the underlying classesGhandGof games.Convex combinations of power indices have the nice feature that they preserve the properties for power indices defined in Section 2.Lemma 1LetP={P1,⋯,Pr}be a collection of power indices such that Pj(1)satisfies the null player property,is symmetric,is strictly positive,is efficient,has the dominance property,is local monotonic, oris invariant for nullsfor all 1 ≤ j ≤ r, thenPα,P,whereα∈Sr,has the same property.For properties (1)–(3) the statement directly follows from the definition. For property (4) we have∑i=1nPij(v)=1for all 1 ≤ j ≤ r. With this we conclude∑i=1nPiα,P(v)=∑i=1n∑j=1rαj·Pij(v)=∑j=1rαj·∑i=1nPij(v)=∑j=1rαj=1,using the fact that the αjsum up to one.For properties (5) and (6) we consider players i and h such thatPij(v)≥Phj(v)for all 1 ≤ j ≤ r. With this we havePiα,P(v)=∑j=1rαj·Pij(v)≥∑j=1rαj·Phj(v)=Phα,P(v),since the αjare non-negative.If the Pjare invariant for nulls, then they have to satisfy the null player property. From (1) we deduce thatPα,Palso satisfies the null player property. Thus it suffices to provePiα,P(v)=Piα,P(v′)for every player i and every game v′ arising from v by deleting an arbitrary null player. We havePiα,P(v)=∑j=1rαj·Pij(v)=∑j=1rαj·Pij(v′)=Piα,P(v′),so that the statement is also true for property (7).□In this paper we are especially interested in the case where not all but at least one power index of a collection{P1,⋯,Pr}satisfies local monotonicity. W.l.o.g. we assume r ≥ 2 and that P1 satisfies local monotonicity while the other indices might or might not satisfy LM. The convex combinationsPα,Pmay or may not satisfy LM, depending on α. At least forα=(1,0,⋯,0)LM is satisfied.LetG⊆Wbe a class of weighted games,n∈N>0andP={P1,⋯,Pr}be a collection of power indices onGsuch that P1 satisfies local monotonicity. ByPLMP(n,G)we denote the set ofα∈Srsuch thatPα,Psatisfies LM on the set of games ofGconsisting of n players.Lemma 2If P1satisfies local monotonicity, then the setPLMP(n,G)is a non-empty (bounded) polyhedron.Obviously, we havePLMP(n,G)⊆Sr. Given a gamev∈Gand two players 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n with i⊐j, we havePiα,P(v)≥Pjα,P(v)if and only ifPiα,P(v)−Pjα,P(v)≥0,which is equivalent to(2)∑h=1rαh·(Pih(v)−Pjh(v))≥0.ThusPLMP(n,G)is given as the intersection ofSrand the half-spaces (and possiblyRrfor trivial inequalities 0 ≥ 0) described by Inequality (2) for allv∈Gconsisting of n players and all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n with i⊐j. We haveG⊆W⊆S,so that the number of n-player games ofGis upper bounded by the number of simple games consisting of n players. Since each simple game is uniquely characterized by its set of winning coalitions the number of simple games with n players is at most22n,i.e., finite. Thus we have a finite intersection of half-spaces and a polyhedron, which is a, possibly empty, polyhedron. It remains to remark that(1,0,⋯,0)∈PLMP(n,G)to conclude the non-emptiness.□We considerP={Bzr︷=:P1,PGIr︷=:P2,Sr︷=:P3},G=W,andn=7,i.e., the class of weighted games with 7 players. Forv=[2;2,1,1,1,1,1,1]we haveBzr(v)=(7,5,⋯,5)andPGIr(v)=Sr(v)=(1,5,⋯,5). The corresponding inequality (2) for game v and players 1, 2 is given byα1·(7−−5)+α2·(1−−5)+α3·(1−−5)≥0. Insertingα2+α3=1−α1yields2α1−4(1−α1)≥0,which is equivalent toα1≥23. Thus for all α withα1<23the convex combinationPα,Pdoes not satisfy local monotonicity, i.e., forα=(23−x,☆,☆)∈S3we havePα,P(v)=(5−6x,5,5). This means that the weight of the Banzhaf index in a convex combination satisfying LM must be at least23,i.e., closer to the Banzhaf index than to the two other indices, on the set of weighted games with 7 players.Again we considerP={Bzr︷=:P1,PGIr︷=:P2,Sr︷=:P3},G=W,andn=7. Forv=[14;9,8,5,2,2,2,2]we haveBzr(v)=(33,31,21,7,7,7,7),PGIr(v)=(6,9,5,7,7,7,7),andSr(v)=(1,8,5,4,4,4,4). The corresponding inequality (2) for the game v and players 1, 2 is given byα1·(33−31)+α2·(6--9)+α3·(1--8)≥0. Insertingα1=1−α2−α3yieldsα2≤25−95·α3after a short calculation. Thus for all α withα2>25−95·α3the convex combinationPα,Pdoes not satisfy local monotonicity.In Figure 1we have depicted the two regions, wherePα,Pdoes not satisfy LM according to the weighted games of Example 4 and Example 5. The weight region, including its border, is a superset ofPLMP(7,W)in general. However, we will see later that both sets indeed coincide.We focus on the necessary weight proportion of P1 in order to ensure local monotonicity ofPα,P. For eachα∈Srthe convex combinationPα,Peither satisfies local monotonicity or not. The smallest value β such that the first case occurs for allα∈Srwith α1 ≥ β is defined as the cost of local monotonicitycP(n,G).Definition 14If P1 satisfies local monotonicity, then the cost of local monotonicity is defined ascP(n,G)=inf{β∈[0,1]∣Pα,PsatisfiesLMon(n,G),∀α∈Sr:α1≥β}for r > 1, where(n,G)stands for the class of gamesGwith at most n players, andcP(n,G)=0forr=1.Some examples may be derived from the previous section. ForG=U,or more generallyG=F,andP={Jo,DP}we havecP(n,G)=0for alln∈N,since the DP index is local monotonic. Similarly, forG=U,or more generallyG=F,andP={Bz,PGI}we havecP(n,G)=0for alln∈N.From Example 4 we concludec{Bzr,PGIr,Sr}(7,W)≥23. The game from Example 5 gives the tighter inequalityc{Bzr,PGIr,Sr}(7,W)≥79. Later on it will turn out that we can replace the infimum in Definition 14 by a minimum. Next we remark that dropping some of the power indices that do not satisfy LM does not increase the cost of local monotonicity:Lemma 3Let P1satisfy local monotonicity and letP1∈P′⊆Pbe a subset, then we havecP′(n,G)≤cP(n,G)for alln∈N>0.For|P′|=1the statement follows fromcP(n,G)≥0. For|P′|>1we can embed the elements ofS|P′|inS|P|by choosing zero for the missing indices.□If P1 satisfies local monotonicity, then we havecP(n,G′)≤cP(n,G)for allG′⊆G.Under slight technical assumptions on the set of power indices and onGwe have monotonicity in the number of players:Lemma 4If P1satisfies local monotonicity, assume that all Pj’s are invariant for nulls and thatGis closed under the addition of null players. Then we havecP(n,G)≤cP(n+1,G)for alln∈N>0.Given an n-player gamev∈GwithPα,P(v)=(p1,⋯,pn),we can construct a gamev′∈Gby adding a null player such thatPα,P(v′)=(p1,⋯,pn,0). SincePα,Psatisfies LM for v if and only ifPα,Psatisfies LM for v′, the statement follows.□For collections ofr=2power indices not only the setPLMP(n,G)is a polyhedron but also its complementSr∖PLMP(n,G)since both sets are intervals. Thus we can replace the infimum in Definition 14 by a minimum for all cases wherer=2. Next we will show that the lower bounds from Lemma 3 for all subsets of cardinality two are sufficient to determine the cost of local monotonicity in general:Lemma 5If P1satisfies local monotonicity, then we havecP(n,G)=max{c{P1,Pj}(n,G)∣2≤j≤r}.From Lemma 3 we concludecP(n,G)≥max{c{P1,Pj}(n,G)∣2≤j≤r}. W.l.o.g. we assumec{P1,Pj}(n,G)<1for all 2 ≤ j ≤ r. Let eidenote the ith unit vector. With this definevj=e1·c{P1,Pj}(n,G)+ej·(1−c{P1,Pj}(n,G))for all 2 ≤ j ≤ r. We have already observed that forr=2the infimum in the definition of the cost of local monotonicity is indeed attained. ThusPvj,Psatisfies LM. SincePLMP(n,G)⊆Sris convex, then−1-dimensional simplexconv(e1,v2,⋯,vr)=:F22conv(a1,⋯,an):={∑i=1nλiai∣∑i=1nλi=1,λ1,⋯,λn≥0}.is contained inPLMP(n,G). Now letAbe the closure ofSr∖F,i.e., the smallest closed set containingSr∖F,which is a polyhedron too. Indeed, the vertices ofAare given byv2,⋯,vrande2,⋯,er.With this we havecP(n,G)≤max{a1∣(a1,⋯,ar)∈A},where the maximum is attained at one of the2r−2vertices ofA. For the verticese2,⋯,erthe respective a1-value is zero. By definition the a1-value of vjis given byc{P1,Pj}for all 2 ≤ j ≤ r. Thus,cP(n,G)≤max{c{P1,Pj}(n,G)∣2≤j≤r}.□If P1satisfies local monotonicity, then we havecP(n,G)=min{β∈R≥0∣Pα,PsatisfiesLMonG∀α∈Sr:α1≥β}So, in order to determinecP(n,G)it suffices to determinec{P1,Ph}(n,G)for all 2 ≤ h ≤ r. Given a gamev∈Gand two players i, j ∈ N with i⊐j, we can solve Inequality (2) for α1 usingα1+αh=1. If Phviolates LM for v and players i, j, we obtain an inequality of the form α1 ≥ u, where u is a suitable real number, and can concludec{P1,Ph}(n,G)≥u. For Example 4 we concludec(Bzr,PGIr)(7,W)≥23and for Example 5 we concludec(Bzr,PGIr)(7,W)≥79.In order to obtain tight bounds for the cost of local monotonicity, we may simply loop over all possible choices of v, i, and j. At the very least, we can partially restrict the number of choices:Lemma 6If P1satisfies local monotonicity andr=2,then we havec(P1,P2)(n,G)=max{li(v)∣v∈G,1≤i≤n−1},whereli(v):=(Pi+12(v)−Pi2(v))/(Pi1(v)−Pi+11(v)+Pi+12(v)−Pi2(v))ifPi+12(v)−Pi2(v)>0and li(v) ≔ 0 otherwise.Assuming1⊐⋯⊐nthe requirement i⊐j is equivalent to i ≤ j. Ifα·P1+(1−α)·P2violates LM for v, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, and players i, j and there exists another player i < i′ < j, then LM is violated for v and at least one of the pairs i, i′ or i′, j of players. Thus, we can restrict our considerations on pairs of players of the formi,i+1,where 1 ≤ i < n.The inequalityαPi1(v)+(1−α)Pi2(v)≥αPi+11(v)+(1−α)Pi+12(v)is equivalent toα·(Pi1(v)−Pi+11(v)︸≥0+Pi+12(v)−Pi2(v))≥Pi+12(v)−Pi2(v).IfPi+12(v)−Pi2(v)≤0this is satisfied for all α ≤ 1. Otherwise it is only satisfied forα≥(Pi+12(v)−Pi2(v))/(Pi1(v)−Pi+11(v)+Pi+12(v)−Pi2(v)).□The big drawback of this exact approach is the usually large size of the set of n-player games ofG. Both sets of n-player complete or weighted games grow faster than exponential. The exact numbers have been determined up ton=9only, see, e.g., Krohn and Sudhölter (1995) for the numbers of complete and weighted games up ton=8,Freixas and Molinero (2010) for the number of complete games forn=9,and Kurz (2012a), Kurz and Tautenhahn (2013) for the number of weighted games forn=9. Forn=9there are 284 432 730 174 complete and 993 061 482 weighted games.33Which had to be slightly corrected recently Kartak, Kurz, Ripatti, and Scheithauer (2015).Thus, using Lemma 6 becomes computationally infeasible for n > 9. So we propose an integer linear programming formulation in the next section.Whenever one is interested in complete games or weighted games, which are extremal with respect to a certain criterion, exhaustive enumeration is not a feasible option for n > 9 players (see the enumeration results stated at the end of the previous section). An alternative is to specify the set games indirectly by binary variables and linear inequalities. If the extremality criterion can be also formulated using integer variables and linear constraints, then integer linear programming techniques can be applied. In the context of cooperative games this approach was introduced in Kurz (2012b) and also applied in this context in Freixas and Kurz (2014), Kurz (2014), Kurz and Napel (2014).For completeness, we briefly repeat the integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of a game v. Since v is uniquely characterized by its values v(S) for all coalitions S ∈ 2N, we introduce binary variables xS∈ {0, 1} for all S ∈ 2N. The conditions for a simple game can be stated asx∅=0,xN=1,and xS≤ xTfor all S⊆T⊆N. We remark that for the later set of inequalities it suffices to consider the pairs of coalitions where|T|=|S|+1. Complete games can be modeled by additionally requiring xS≤ xTfor all pairs of coalitions with ti⊐sifor 1 ≤ i ≤ m, whereS={s1,⋯,sm}andT={t1,⋯,tm}.In order to restrict v to weighted games we additionally have to introduce weights wi≥ 0 and a quota q > 0, where we assume that the weight of each winning coalition is larger than the weight of each losing coalition by at least one. (We may simply use integer weights, which could result in harder problems for the ILP solver.) To interlink the xSwith the wiand q we useq−(1−xS)·M−∑i∈Swi≤0∀S∈2Nand−xS·M+∑i∈Swi≤q−1∀S∈2N,where M is a suitably large constant fulfillingM−1≥∑i=1nwi. (We may chooseM=4n(n+14)(n+1)/2,see Muroga (1971, Theorem 9.3.2.1).)The restrictions to proper games can be formulated viaxS+xN∖S≤1for all S⊆N with|S|≤n2. Similarly we can restrict to strong games by requestingxS+xN∖S≥1. For constant sum games we needxS+xN∖S=1.In order to compute the power distribution ofBzr,PGIr,andSrfrom the xS, we introduce further binary variables, cf. Kurz (2014). For i ∈ N and S ∈ 2Nwe setyi,S=1if and only if coalition S is critical for player i andyi,S=0otherwise. This can be ensured by requestingyi,S=0for i ∉ S andyi,S=xS−xS∖{i}otherwise. Similarly we introduce zS∈ {0, 1}, wherezS=1if and only if S is a minimal winning coalition. This condition can be linearly reformulated aszS−xS≤0∀S∈2N,zS+xS∖{i}≤1∀S∈2N,i∈S,andzS−xS+∑i∈SxS∖{i}≥0∀S∈2N.In order to identify shift-minimal winning coalitions, we introduce binary variables uS∈ {0, 1} for all S ∈ 2N. In order to state characterizing linear constraints we additionally need binary variables ti∈ {0, 1} for all1≤i≤n−1,which are equal to 0 if and only if players i andi+1are of the same type, i.e.,i□i+1. This equivalence can be ensured by requestingxS∪{i}−xS∪{i+1}−ti≤0∀1≤i≤n−1,S⊆N∖{i,i+1}and−ti+∑S⊆N∖{i,i+1}xS∪{i}−xS∪{i+1}≥0∀1≤i≤n−1.Ifti=0,i.e.,i□i+1,then S ∪ {i} is a shift-minimal winning coalition if and only ifS∪{i+1}is a shift-minimal winning coalition, whereS⊆N∖{i,i+1}and1≤i≤n−1. This conditioned equivalence can be expressed asuS∪{i}≥uS∪{i+1}−tianduS∪{i+1}≥uS∪{i}−ti.So in the following we can restrict our considerations on coalitions S such that for each i ∈ S we either havei=n,i+1∈Sori⊐i+1.Since each shift-minimal winning coalition has to be a minimal winning coalition, we require uS≤ zSfor all S ∈ 2N. The other possibility disqualifying a coalition S from being a shift-minimal winning coalition is the existence of player i ∈ S\{n} withi+1∉Sandi⊐i+1such thatS∪{i+1}∖{i}is winning. So we requireuS≤1+xS−xS∪{i+1}∖{i}−tifor all S⊆N, n ≠ i ∈ S andi+1∉S. SincexS≥xS∪{i+1}∖{i}the right hand side is at least zero. So let us assumeti=1. Since uS≤ zS≤ xSit suffices to consider the cases wherexS=1. IfxS∪{i+1}∖{i}=1then the stated inequality is trivially true. Just in the single case, wherexS=1,xS∪{i+1}∖{i}=0,andti=1,it impliesuS=0.By now we can guarantee thatuS=0if S is not a shift-minimal winning coalition. HoweveruS=0is still feasible for shift-minimal winning coalitions. So, we additionally requireuS−xS+∑i∈N∖{n}:i∈S,i+1∉SxS∪{i+1}∖{i}≥0for all S⊆N\n anduS−xS+xS∖{n}+∑i∈N∖{n}:i∈S,i+1∉SxS∪{i+1}∖{i}≥0for all {n}⊆S⊆N. IfxS=0or one of thexS∪{i+1}∖{i}=1,then the proposed inequality is trivially satisfied. So we assume otherwise. In the cases where n ∈ S we can similarly assumexS∖{n}=0. In this remaining case we have the implicationuS=1,which is correct since no certificate for not being a shift-minimal winning coalition exists, so that S is a shift-minimal winning coalition.Finally consider the case where S indeed is a shift-minimal winning coalition. ThusxS=1. Remember that we need the implication uS≥ 1 just for the coalitions S, where for each player i ∈ S we either havei=n,i+1∈S,ori⊐i+1. So we can assumei⊐i+1for all indices i in the summation. ThusxS∪{i+1}∖{i}=0. If n ∈ S, then alsoxS∖{n}=0since S is a minimal winning coalition.Having these variables at hand, we can easily compute the following power indices:Bzir(v)=∑S⊆Nyi,S,PGIir(v)=∑{i}⊆S⊆NzS,Sir(v)=∑{i}⊆S⊆NuS,DPir(v)=∑{i}⊆S⊆N1|S|·zS,andSDPir(v)=∑{i}⊆S⊆N1|S|·uS.For the Johnston index we have to take care that only the critical players obtain an equal share for each coalition. To this end we introduce the continuous variablesbi,S∈R≥0for all i ∈ N and all S ∈ 2N, cf. Kurz (2014):bi,S≤yi,S∀S∈2N,i∈Nbi,S−bjS≥yi,S+yj,S−2∀S∈2N,i,j∈N∑i=1nbi,S≤1∀S∈2N∑j=1nbi,S≥yi,S∀S∈2N,i∈N.Given an arbitrary coalition S⊆N, we can easily check that∑i=1nbi,S=0if S is not a critical coalition for any player i ∈ N and∑i=1nbi,S=1otherwise. In the later case we havebi,S=0whenever player i is not critical in coalition S. The second set of inequalities guaranteesbi,S=bj,Swhenever both i and j are critical in coalition S. So we can stateJoir(v)=∑S⊆Nbi,S.As a target we maximizePi+1α,P(v)−Piα,P(v)=∑h=1rαhPi+1h(v)−αhPih(v),where1≤i≤n−1has to be specified as a parameter. By looping over all possible values of i we can decide whetherPα,Psatisfies LM for a givenα∈Sr.Lemma 7ForP⊆{Bzr,PGIr,Sr,Jor,DPr,SDPr},r:=|P|,andα∈Sr,one can decideα∈PLMP(n,G)if incidence vectors of the n-player games inGform a polyhedron.To be more precise, we have explicitly stated ILP formulations for the classes of gamesG∈{S,C,W,Sp,Cp,Wp,Ss,Cs,Ws,Sc,Cc,Wc}. Having the binary variables tiat hand restrictions on the number of equivalence classes of players or even the precise partition can be formulated easily. ILP formulations for further power indices can be found in Kurz (2014).We assume that the algorithm behind Lemma 7 gives either the answer yes, if all correspondingn−1ILPs have an optimal target value of zero, or gives the answer no together with a gamev∈Gand an index1≤i≤n−1such thatPα,Pviolates LM for the game v and players i,i+1. The following algorithm computes the cost of local monotonicity for convex combinations of two power indices, i.e.,P={P1,Ph}:α1=0αh=1go_on=truewhilego_on=truedogo_on=falseforifrom 1 ton−1doifmaxα1Pi+11(v)−α1Pi1(v)+αhPi+1h(v)−αhPih(v)>0thengo_on=truechoosev☆∈argmaxα1Pi+11(v)−α1Pi1(v)+αhPi+1h(v)−αhPih(v)>0determine β withβ(Pi+11(v☆)−Pi1(v☆))+(1−β)(Pi+1h(v☆)−Pih(v☆))=0α1=βαh=1−βend ifend forend whileBy considering parametric examples we can obtain general lower bounds for the cost of local monotonicity.Lemma 8ForP=(Bzr,PGIr)and n ≥ 2 we havecP(n,W)≥max(0,n−3n−1).SincecP(n,W)≥0by definition, it suffices to consider weighted games with n ≥ 4 players. For the weighted gamev=[2;2,1,⋯,1],withn−1players of weight 1 and one player of weight 2, the minimal winning coalitions are given by {1} and {i, j}, where 2 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Thus, we havePGI1r(v)=1andPGI2r(v)=n−2. For player 1 the critical coalitions are given by {1} and {1, i} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Given a player j ≥ 2 the critical coalitions for player j are given by {i, j} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n, with i ≠ j. Thus, we haveBz1r(v)=nandBz2r(v)=n−2.For players 1, 2 and game v Inequality (2) readsα1·Bz1r(v)+α2·PGI1r(v)≥α1·Bz2r(v)+α2·PGI2r(v),which is equivalent toα1·n+α2·1≥α1·(n−2)+α2·(n−2)⟺α1≥n−3n−1,sinceα1+α2=1.□ForP=(Bzr,Sr)and n ≥ 2 we havecP(n,W)≥max(0,n−3n−1).Since all minimal winning coalitions in the example of the proof of Lemma 8 are also shift-minimal winning, we can apply the same proof for the Shift index.□So, from Lemma 8, Corollary 4, and Lemma 5 we can conclude that the cost of local monotonicity is at leastn−3n−1forP=(Bzr,PGIr,Sr)and all n ≥ 2.Corollary 5limn→∞c(Bzr,PGIr)(n,W)=limn→∞c(Bzr,Sr)(n,W)=limn→∞c(Bzr,PGIr,Sr)(n,W)=1The limit results implies that the only convex combination ofBzr,PGIr,andSrthat is locally monotonic for all weighted games (independently of the number of players) is the raw Banzhaf index itself. For a fixed finite number of players it may still be possible that the cost of local monotonicity is strictly less than 1.Having the ILP approach from the previous section at hand we can also determine the exact value of the cost of local monotonicity for a small number of players. It turns out that the lower bound from Lemma 8 is tight for all n ≤ 10. So, especially for n ≤ 3 we have a cost of local monotonicity of zero, which goes in line with the fact that all weighted games with at most 3 players are locally monotonic. Although the ILP approach can move the computational limit of exhaustive enumeration a bit, it is so far limited to n ≤ 10. Since we were not able to find improving examples, we state:Conjecture 1ForP=(Bzr,PGIr)and n ≥ 2 we havecP(n,W)=max(0,n−3n−1).We remark that the extremal examples are not unique, e.g., we have the weighted games [4; 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1], [10; 10, 8, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2] and [7; 7, 6, 6, 6, 5, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1] also meeting the bound from Lemma 8 forn=6,n=8,andn=10,respectively. The respective Banzhaf scores are given by (11, 9, 5, 5, 3, 3), (28, 26, 16, 12, 12, 10, 10, 6), and (24, 22, 22, 22, 20, 12, 12, 12, 8, 6). The respective PGI scores are given by (1, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3), (1, 6, 11, 9, 9, 8, 8, 6), and (1, 8, 8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 7, 6).For combinations of the Banzhaf score and the Shift score the lower bound of Corollary 4 is tight for n ≤ 6. For 7 ≤ n ≤ 11 we were able to compute improving examples.Lemma 9LetP=(Bzr,Sr).(1)Forn=7we havecP(n,W)=79≈0.77777.Forn=8we havecP(n,W)=78=0.875.Forn=9we havecP(n,W)=2527≈0.92593.Forn=10we havecP(n,W)=5153≈0.96226.Forn=11we havecP(n,W)=9799≈0.97980.Forn=12we havecP(n,W)≥175177≈0.98870.For the lower bounds we state an explicit weighted game and the Banzhaf and the Shift score for the first two players:(1)[14; 9, 8, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2],Bzr=(33,31,⋯),Sr=(1,8,⋯);[16; 11, 10, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],Bzr=(65,63,⋯),Sr=(1,15,⋯);[30; 16, 15, 7, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],Bzr=(129,127,⋯),Sr=(2,27,⋯),[18; 13, 12, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],Bzr=(129,127,⋯),Sr=(1,26,⋯);[33; 19, 18, 7, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],Bzr=(257,255,⋯),Sr=(2,53,⋯);[36; 22, 21, 7, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],Bzr=(513,511,⋯),Sr=(2,99,⋯).[56; 29, 28, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],Bzr=(1025,1023,⋯),Sr=(2,177,⋯).For the upper bounds we have applied the ILP approach.□We have already stated some other tight examples before. We would highlight just another tight example, where the bound is met between the second and the third player, forn=9: [8; 5, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] with Banzhaf score (85, 43, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41) and Shift score (22, 1, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26).We provide a general construction meeting the cost of local monotonicity of the best known examples for all n ≥ 6:Lemma 10Let k ≥ 1 be an integer, m ∈ {0, 1, 2},n=3k+3+m,andv=[2t+m(k+1);t+1+m(k+1),t+m(k+1),2k+3,⋯,2k+3︷ktimes,k+1,⋯,k+1︷2k+1+mtimes],wheret=2k2+3k+1. With this, v is a weighted game consisting of n players,Bz1r(v)=2n−2+1,Bz2r(v)=2n−2−1,S1r(v)=1fork=1,S1r(v)=2for k > 1, andS2r(v)=−1+S1r(v)+∑a=0k∑b=⌈t−a(2k+3)k+1⌉(ka)·(2k+1+mb).We can easily check that v consists ofn=3k+3+mplayers having 4 different non-negative weights. For the ease of notation we denote coalition types as a 4-tuple (c1, c2, c3, c4) meaning a coalition having 0 ≤ c1 ≤ 1 players of weightt+1+m(k+1),0 ≤ c2 ≤ 1 players of weightt+m(k+1),0 ≤ c3 ≤ k players of weight2k+3,and0≤c4≤2k+1+mplayers of weightk+1. Due to symmetry it suffices to know the countsc1,⋯,c4instead of the precise coalitions.Note that the sum of weights of the players of weight2k+3is given byt−1. The sum of weights of players of weightk+1is given byt+m(k+1). Next we show that the players of the 4 weight types are non-equivalent. Since (1, 1, 0, 0) is winning and (1, 0, 1, 0) is losing, the player of weightt+m(k+1)is non-equivalent to players of weight2k+3. Since (1, 0, k, 0) and winning and (0, 1, k, 0) is losing the first two players are non-equivalent. Since (1, 0, k, 0) is winning and (1, 0, 0, k) is losing, also the players of weight2k+3are non-equivalent to players of weightk+1. Due to the decreasing sequence of weights, we have four equivalence classes of players coinciding with the sets of players that have an equal weight.A coalition type (1, 1, a, b) corresponds to critical coalitions for player 1 if and only ifa(2k+3)+b(k+1)≤t−1. Similarly, a coalition type (1, 0, a, b) corresponds to critical coalitions for player 1 if and only ifa(2k+3)+b(k+1)≥t−1. So we are interested in the number of cases wherea(2k+3)+b(k+1)=t−1. Considering this equation modulok+1yieldsa≡−1(modk)+1,so thata=k,b=0is the unique solution. Thus we haveBz1r(v)=2n−2+1.A coalition type (1, 1, a, b) corresponds to critical coalitions for player 2 if and only ifa(2k+3)+b(k+1)≤t−2and a coalition type (0, 1, a, b) corresponds to critical coalitions for player 2 if and only ifa(2k+3)+b(k+1)≥t. Thus we haveBz1r(v)=2n−2−1.The coalition {1, 2} is a minimal winning coalition in any case. We can easily check that it is shift-minimal winning if and only if k > 1. Since the weight of (1, 0, k, 0) exactly equals the quota, the corresponding unique coalition is shift-minimal in any case. Now assume that a coalition S of type (1, 0, a, b) is shift-minimal winning. Since S has to be winning, we havea(2k+3)+b(k+1)≥t−1. Since (0, 1, a, b) has to be losing, we havea(2k+3)+b(k+1)=t−1. As mentioned before, the unique solution of this equation is given bya=kandb=0. Thus, we haveS1r(v)=1fork=1andS1r(v)=2for k > 1.Every minimal winning coalition besides {1, 2} containing player 2 has to be of type (0, 1, a, b). For any 0 ≤ a ≤ k the unique value for b is given byb(a)=⌈t−a(2k+3)k+1⌉,where1≤b≤2k+1. Since2k+3>2·(k+1)we haveb(a)+1<b(a−1),i.e., the corresponding coalitions are shift-minimal winning. Counting the number of coalitions of type (0, 1, a, b(a)) givesS2r(v)=−1+S1r(v)+∑a=0k∑b=⌈t−a(2k+3)k+1⌉(ka)·(2k+1+mb).□Of course one may speculate whether the stated construction is tight for all n ≥ 6. At the very least we can conclude thatcP(n,W)tends at least exponentially to 1, i.e., there are constants d1 > 0, d2 > 1 withcP(n,W)≥1−d1·d2−n,forP=(Bzr,Sr). Conjecture 1 on the other hand would imply only a linear convergence rate. So, in some sense, the Shift index is even less locally monotonic than the Public Good index.Next we go on and consider restrictions of the class of weighted games.Lemma 11ForP=(Bzr,PGIr)and n ≥ 3 we havecP(n,Wp)≥max(0,n−4n−2).SincecP(n,W)≥0by definition, it suffices to consider weighted games with n ≥ 5 players. We consider the weighted gamev=[2n−3;n−1,n−2,n−2,1,⋯,1]withn−3players of weight 1, two players of weightn−2>1and one player of weightn−1. Since the sum of voting weights is4n−8<2·(2n−3),the game is proper. The minimal winning coalitions are given by {1, 2}, {1, 3}, and {2, 3, i} for all 4 ≤ i ≤ n. Thus, we havePGIr(v)=(2,n−2,n−2,1,⋯,1). The critical coalitions for player 1 are given by {1, 2, 3} and all coalitions of the form {1, i} ∪ S, where i ∈ {2, 3} andS⊆{4,⋯,n}. The critical coalitions for player 2 are given by {1, 2} and all coalitions of the form {2, 3} ∪ S, where∅≠S⊆{4,⋯,n}. The unique critical coalition for a player i ≥ 4 is given by {2, 3, i}. Thus, we haveBzr(v)=(2n−2+1,2n−2−1,2n−2−1,1,⋯,1).For players 1, 2 and game v Inequality (2) is equivalent to2α1≥α1·Bz2r(v)+(n−4)α2. Insertingα1+α2=1yieldsα1≥n−4n−2.□ForP=(Bzr,Sr)and n ≥ 3 we havecP(n,Wp)≥max(0,n−4n−2).Using the ILP approach we can verify that Lemma 11 is tight for n ≤ 10 and Corollary 6 is tight for n ≤ 6.Lemma 12LetP=(Bzr,Sr).(1)Forn=7we havecP(n,Wp)=57≈0.71429.Forn=8we havecP(n,Wp)=1113≈0.84615.Forn=9we havecP(n,Wp)=1213≈0.92308.Forn=10we havecP(n,Wp)=2122≈0.95455.Forn=11we havecP(n,Wp)=8385≈0.97647.For the lower bounds we state an explicit weighted game and the Banzhaf and the Shift score for the first two players:(1)[21; 11, 10, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3],Bzr=(33,31,⋯),Sr=(2,7,⋯);[25; 13, 12, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3],Bzr=(65,63,⋯),Sr=(2,13,⋯);[31; 16, 15, 7, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],Bzr=(129,127,⋯),Sr=(2,26,⋯);[39; 12, 11, 9, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],Bzr=(194,192,⋯),Sr=(1,45,⋯);[32; 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],Bzr=(324,322,⋯),Sr=(1,84,⋯).For the upper bounds we have applied the ILP approach.□Since the parametric example from Lemma 8 and the examples from Lemma 9 and Lemma 10 have the property that the sum of weights meets or exceeds twice the quota, the respective games are all strong. Thus, the same results are valid if we restrict the class of weighted games to weighted strong games. Clearly we also conjecturecP(n,Ws)=max(0,n−3n−1)for all n ≥ 2, whereP=(Bzr,PGIr),which is a weakening of Conjecture 1.Observe that the parametric example from Lemma 11 and the examples from Lemma 12 are not strong, so the cost of local monotonicity may decrease for constant sum weighted games compared to proper weighted games.If we consider the subclass of constant-sum games within the class of weighted games, then the non-monotonicity is generally reduced, i.e., a lower contribution of the Banzhaf score is sufficient to guarantee local monotonicity of the power index obtained as a convex combination.Lemma 13ForP=(Bzr,PGIr)and n ≥ 2 we havecP(n,Wc)≥max(0,n−5n−1).SincecP(n,W)≥0by definition, it suffices to consider weighted games with n ≥ 6 players. For the weighted gamev=[2n−5;n−2,n−3,n−3,1⋯,1],withn−3players of weight 1, the minimal winning coalitions are given by {1, 2}, {1, 3},{1,4,5,⋯,n},and {2, 3, i}, where 4 ≤ i ≤ n. Thus, we havePGIr1(v)=3andPGIr2(v)=n−2. For player 1 the critical coalitions are given by {1, 2, 3},{1,4,5,⋯,n},and {1, 2} ∪ S, {1, 3} ∪ S, whereS⊆{4,5,⋯,n}. For player 2 the critical coalitions are given by {1, 2} ∪ U, whereU⊆{4,5,⋯,n}with|U|<n−3,and {2, 3} ∪ V, where∅≠V⊆{4,5,⋯,n}. Thus, we haveBzr1(v)=2n−2+2andBzr2(v)=2n−2−2.For players 1, 2 and game v Inequality (2) is equivalent to4α1≥α1·Bz2r(v)+(n−5)α2. Insertingα1+α2=1yieldsα1≥n−5n−1.□ForP=(Bzr,Sr)and n ≥ 2 we havecP(n,Wc)≥max(0,n−5n−1).limn→∞c(Bzr,PGIr)(n,Wc)=limn→∞c(Bzr,Sr)(n,Wc)=limn→∞c(Bzr,PGIr,Sr)(n,Wc)=1Using the ILP approach we can verify that Lemma 13 is tight for n ≤ 11 and Corollary 7 is tight for n ≤ 7.Lemma 14LetP=(Bzr,Sr).(1)Forn=8we havecP(n,Wc)=23≈0.66667.Forn=9we havecP(n,Wc)=2327≈0.85185.Forn=10we havecP(n,Wc)=4347≈0.91489.Forn=11we havecP(n,Wc)=7579≈0.94937.For the lower bounds we state an explicit weighted game and the Banzhaf and the Shift score for the first two players:(1)[17; 9, 8, 5, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2],Bzr=(66,62,⋯),Sr=(3,11,⋯);[21; 11, 10, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],Bzr=(130,126,⋯),Sr=(3,26,⋯);[21; 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],Bzr=(170,166,⋯),Sr=(5,48,⋯);[22; 8, 7, 7, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],Bzr=(386,382,⋯),Sr=(4,79,⋯).For the upper bounds we have applied the ILP approach.□Similar results can be obtained forJor,DPr,andSDPr.Lemma 15LetP=(Jor,DPr).(1)For n ≤ 4 we havecP(n,W)=0.Forn=5we havecP(n,W)=18=0.125.Forn=6we havecP(n,W)=14=0.25.Forn=7we havecP(n,W)=13≈0.33333.Forn=8we havecP(n,W)=25=0.4.Forn=9we havecP(n,W)≥1125=0.44.Forn=10we havecP(n,W)≥12=0.5.For the lower bounds we state an explicit weighted game, the Johnston and the Deegan-Packel score, where we highlight the values of the critical players:(2)[3; 3, 2, 2, 1, 1],Jor=(6,52,52,1,1),DPr=(1,32,32,1,1);[8; 4, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1],Jor=(152,152,6,23,23,23),DPr=(32,32,2,23,23,23);[9; 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2],Jor=(703,283,233,196,196,196,196),SDPr=(236,176,113,196,196,196,196);[12; 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],Jor=(192,192,192,172,172,172,172,172),DPr=(476,476,476,172,172,172,172,172);[20; 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],Jor=(192,⋯,192,695,⋯,695),DPr=(534,⋯,534,695,⋯,695);[20; 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],Jor=(1034,⋯,1034,a25,⋯,25),DPr=(974,⋯,974,a25,⋯,25);For the upper bounds we have applied the ILP approach.□ForP=(Jor,DPr)the cost of local monotonicity seems to be increasing rather slowly. Given the numerical data from Lemma 15 it is not clear at all whethercP(n,W)tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. To this end we consider the following construction for an odd number of players:Lemma 16For k ≥ 1 andv=[k(k+1);k+1,⋯,k+1︷ktimes,k,⋯,k︷k+1times]we haveJoir(v)=c(k)for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k,Joir(v)=d(k)for allk+1≤2k+1,DPir(v)=c(k)−k+1kfor all 1 ≤ i ≤ k, andDPir(v)=d(k)for allk+1≤2k+1,wherec(k)=k+2k+1k+1∑i=1k−1(k−1i−1)·(k+1i)andd(k)=1k+1+1k+1·∑i=1k−1(ki)2.We can easily check that v consists ofn=2k+1players having two different weights. As in the proof of Lemma 10 we use a 2-tuple (c1, c2) to describe the type of a coalition. Since the coalitions of type (k, 0) are winning but the coalitions of type (0, k) are losing, no player of weightk+1is equivalent to a player of weight k.In coalitions of type (k, 0) or type (k, 1) all players of weightk+1are critical players, while the players of weight k are not critical players. The other types of coalitions which contain a least one critical player are given by(i,k+1−i),where0≤i≤k−1. In these cases all involvedk+1players are critical. Counting the number of cases, where player 1 is contained, for each of the mentioned coalition types givesJo1r(v)=(k−1k−1)·(k+10)·1k+(k−1k−1)·(k+11)·1k+1k+1·∑i=1k−1(k−1i−1)·(k+1i)=c(k)Counting the number of cases, where player n is contained, for each of the mentioned coalition types givesJonr(v)=1k+1+1k+1·∑i=1k−1(ki)·(ki)=d(k).All coalition types except (k, 1) correspond to minimal winning coalitions. Thus we haveDP1r(v)=Jo1r(v)−(k−1k−1)·(k+11)·1k=c(k)−k+1kandDPnr(v)=Jonr(v)=d(k). The values for the remaining players follow from symmetry.□ForP=(Jor,DPr)and n ≥ 1 we havecP(n,W)≥1−2(3n−2)n2≥1−6n.For the weighted game from Lemma 16 Inequality (2) yieldscP(2k+1,W)≥1−kk+1·(c(k)−d(k)). Since∑i=1k−1(k−1i−1)·(k+1i)−∑i=1k−1(ki)2=−(k−1),we havec(k)−d(k)=3k+2k(k+1). ThuscP(2k+1,W)≥1−3k+2(k+1)2. SincecP(n,W)≥cP(n−1,W)we can choosek=⌈n−22⌉and obtain the stated lower bounds.□ForP=(Jor,DPr)we havelimn→∞cP(n,W)=1.LetP=(Jor,SDPr).(1)For n ≤ 4 we havecP(n,W)=0.Forn=5we havecP(n,W)=13≈0.33333.Forn=6we havecP(n,W)=35=0.6.Forn=7we havecP(n,W)=79≈0.77778.Forn=8we havecP(n,W)=4753≈0.88679.Forn=9we havecP(n,W)≥2931≈0.93548.For the lower bounds we state an explicit weighted game and the Johnston and the Shift Deegan-Packel score for the last two players:(2)[4; 3, 3, 2, 2, 1],Jor=(⋯,2,1),SDPr=(⋯,12,1);[8; 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1],Jor=(⋯,2,43),SDPr=(⋯,13,43);[8; 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],Jor=(⋯,196,83),Sr=(⋯,1112,83);[15; 7, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2],Jor=(⋯,8615,163),SDPr=(⋯,115,163);[12; 7, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],Jor=(⋯,476,152),SDPr=(⋯,83,152).For the upper bounds we have applied the ILP approach.□Quite obviously the cost of local monotonicity forP=(Jor,SDPr)seems to converge to 1 as n increases. An appropriate lower bound can be concluded from the parametric examplev=[2(n−3);n−2,n−2,2,⋯,2︸n−3times,1],where n ≥ 5, by considering the last two players. We remark that the exact value forn=7and the lower bound forn=9is attained for this parametric family.In the previous section we have computationally determined the cost of local monotonicity for several sets of two or three power indices on subclasses of weighted games. Now we want to gain even more information: Given a collectionPof r ≥ 2 power indices, for whichα∈SrdoesPα,Psatisfy local monotonicity? In Lemma 2 we have obtained the result that the respective setPLMP(n,G)is a polyhedron. As already discussed, each gamev∈Ggives a valid inequality forPLMP(n,G). Using the ILP approach from Section 5 we can check whether a given pointα∈Sris contained inPLMP(n,G). In the case where α is not contained inPLMP(n,G),we obtain a gamev∈Gverifying this fact. So either we can verify vertices of our polyhedron or compute additional non-redundant valid inequalities. So, instead of looping over all games inG,we can use the following algorithm to determinePLMP(n,G):P=Srcompute the setAof vertices ofPfor allα∈Adoverified(α)=falseend forwhile∃α∈Awithverified(α)=falsedoifα∈PLMP(n,G)thenverified(α)=trueelsecompute certifying gamev∈Gadd inequalities corresponding to v toPcompute the setAof vertices ofPsetverified(α)=falsefor all new verticesend ifend whilereturnPWe remark that we may also include the information that(1,0,⋯,0)∈PLMP(n,G)in any case, i.e., one of the r vertices ofSrcan be set to be verified. If already determined, ther−1examples for the cost of local monotonicity forP′={P1,Pi}can be used to replace the initialization ofP,i.e., settingP=conv(e1,p2,⋯,pr),where eiis the ith unit vector andpi=e1·c{P1,Pi}(n,G)+ei·(1−c{P1,Pi}(n,G)).As an example, we have performed the computations forG=W,P={Bzr,PGIr,Sr},and n ≤ 9.Lemma 18ForP={Bzr,PGIr,Sr}we have(1)PLMP(n,W)=S3=conv{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)}for n ≤ 3;PLMP(4,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(13,23,0),(13,0,23)};PLMP(5,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(12,12,0),(12,0,12)};PLMP(6,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(35,25,0),(35,0,25)};PLMP(7,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(23,13,0),(79,0,29),(23,14,112)};PLMP(8,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(57,27,0),(78,0,18),(57,935,135)};PLMP(9,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(34,14,0),(2527,0,227),(34,1980,180)}.As an example, we have drawnPLM{Bzr,PGIr,Sr}(7,W)in Fig. 2. The filled region is the complement of the region drawn in Fig. 1. In order to illustrate the proposed algorithm we consider the casen=9as an example. For{Bzr,PGIr}the cost of local monotonicity is given by34and e.g. attained at the gamev1=[2;2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. We haveBzr(v1)=(9,7,⋯),PGIr(v1)=(1,7,⋯),andSr(v1)=(1,7,⋯). For{Bzr,Sr}the cost of local monotonicity is given by2527and e.g. attained at the gamev2=[30;16,15,7,7,3,3,3,3,3]. We haveBzr(v2)=(129,127,⋯),PGIr(v2)=(23,27,⋯),andSr(v2)=(2,27,⋯). The hyperplane corresponding to v1 is given by2α1−6α2−6α3=0and the hyperplane corresponding to v2 is given by2α1−4α2−25α3=0. Together withα1+α2+α3=1we obtain the new vertexα′=(34,1984,142). By using the ILP approach we can compute that α′ does not lead to a locally monotonic power index and obtain the gamev3=[18;13,12,5,2,2,2,2,2,2]withBzr(v3)=(129,127,⋯),PGIr(v3)=(22,27,⋯),andSr(v3)=(1,26,⋯). For this game the corresponding hyperplane is given by2α1−5α2−25α3=0. Again there arises exactly one new vertex:α′′=(34,1980,180). By using the ILP approach we can compute that α′′ is contained inPLMP(9,W),so that the determination of the polyhedron is completed.We remark that α′′ does also attain the cost of local monotonicity for{Bzr,Sr}. So if we had started with the games v1 and v3 instead of v1 and v2, our algorithm would have needed one iteration less.A similar result is obtained for the three other indices considered in the paper:Lemma 19ForP={Jor,DPr,SDPr}we have(1)PLMP(n,W)=S3=conv{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1)}for n ≤ 4;PLMP(5,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(18,78,0),(13,0,23),(117,717,917)};PLMP(6,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(14,34,0),(35,0,25),(14,716,516)};PLMP(7,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(13,23,0),(79,0,29),(1961,3261,1061)};PLMP(8,W)=conv{(1,0,0),(25,35,0),(4753,0,653),(197503,264503,42503)}.Finally, we want to consider a more complex example of linear combinations of four power indices, where two of them satisfy LM. To this end we denote bySSIr(v)the raw Shapley–Shubik index of a weighted game v, consisting of n players, times n!.44The philosophy of the definition ofBzr,PGIr,andSris the counting of relevant coalitions for each player, where relevant is specified differently in each case. The Shapley–Subik index weights critical coalitions with respect to their size, while the Banzhaf index treats all critical coalitions equally. Dropping the normalization factor of2n−1from the Banzhaf index is somehow similar to dropping the normalization factor of n! of the Shapley–Shubik index.With this, we chooseP={SSIr,Bzr,PGIr,Sr}. From the 25 weighted games on 4 players justv1=[2;2,1,1,1]andv2=[3;3,2,1,1]violate LM forPGIrorSr. We havePGIr(v1)=Sr(v1)=PGIr(v2)=Sr(v2)=(1,2,1,1),SSIr(v1)=(12,4,4,4),SSIr(v2)=(14,6,2,2),Bzr(v1)=(4,2,2,2),andBzr(v2)=(5,3,1,1). In both cases the condition for the α-multipliers to ensure LM is equivalent to8α1+2α2≥α3+α4,i.e.,PLMP(4,W)={α∈R≥04∣8α1+2α2≥α3+α4,α1+α2+α3+α4=1}. Dropping eitherSSIrorBzrwe could speak of the cost of LM forBzrorSSIr,respectively.
