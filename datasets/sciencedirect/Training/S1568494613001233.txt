@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) arising from intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) is generalized by including a parameter reflecting a moderator's opinion about the validity of the information provided. The resulting generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (GIFSS) finds a special role in the decision making applications. It can evaluate the given criteria along with the moderator's assessment of the furnished data. The properties of GIFSS are investigated and the associated relations called generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft relations (GIFSR) are given. A similarity measure is given to compare two GIFSSs. As this is not applicable to fuzzy numbers, a new score function is devised to compare two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs), the components of IFS. The effectiveness of the proposed GIFSS in decision making is demonstrated on four case studies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) [1,2] extends a fuzzy set by having an additional hesitancy parameter besides the usual membership function. The hesitancy parameter makes IFS useful in modeling many real life activities like evaluation, negotiation and decision making where judgments of human beings play a major role. Molodtsov [3] has pointed out that both the fuzzy set and intuitionistic fuzzy set theories suffer from the inherent difficulty that the magnitude of membership grade for x given by an individual is directly dependent on the knowledge available to the individual; hence prone to variations. Moreover, both the fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy theories lack an appropriate parameterization tool. The theory of soft sets addresses these limitations [3].The soft set theory is based on adequate parameterization. The description of objects is more comprehensive in the soft set theory than in the fuzzy and the intuitionistic fuzzy theories. One can have any number of attributes/parameters in the description of an object in the soft set theory. This makes it easier to compare the objects in terms of the attributes thereby permitting the decision making even with partial information. In view of this, the soft set theory has found several applications in multi-criteria decision making [8,17].Maji et al. [4–6] have combined the soft set theory with the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory to come up with the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS). The parameterization and hesitancy accrued to IFSS from this combination facilitate the descriptions of the real-world situations quite accurately. In particular, IFSS is extremely useful in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems where the evaluation of alternatives is done by experts based on the attributes. The suitability of IFSS for the decision making applications is aptly highlighted in [7,8].The MCDM model in an IFSS environment takes into account the hesitancy of experts in arriving at the membership grades since the IFS allows an expert to record his hesitancy factor. However, hesitancy is a feature of one's own perception, and it needs to be supported by another independent observer/expert. To address this problem, the notion of generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (GIFSS) is introduced in [25] and developed independently in [26,27]. The framework of GIFSS requires the moderator's assessment of the credibility of the information in the original IFSS so as to make up for any distortion in the information provided.In this paper, we further extend the concept of GIFSS by introducing a generalization parameter which itself is intuitionistic fuzzy. We also develop the relations on GIFSS, termed as generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft relations (GIFSR). A score function and a similarity measure are devised for the comparison of two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and two GIFSSs respectively. The suitability of GIFSS in supplier selection and medical diagnosis problems is examined by taking up case studies from the real world.In our view, it is hard to make accurate decisions on the basis of the individuals’ vague conceptions. The GIFSS attempts to minimize the possibility of errors caused by the imprecise information by taking the moderator's opinion on the same. For example, a patient might exaggerate the symptoms which may lead to incorrect diagnosis. The specialist may not have enough time to ascertain the information supplied by probing the patient in detail. It may be more judicious to have a junior doctor moderate the severity of the symptoms of a patient through a generalization parameter.The GIFSS has a wide scope in the areas like economics, supply chain management, financial accounting and medical expert systems. For an example, in the current medical practice, a specialist diagnoses a patient simply going by the symptoms reported. Similarly the decisions related to the supplier selection problems are based solely upon the evaluation of the suppliers by the domain experts. In such decision making problems, the possibility of error in the judgment (of a patient about the severity of his symptom or of the domain experts in the evaluation of a supplier with respect to a criterion) cannot be ruled out. The potential of the proposed framework in addressing this issue will be demonstrated on a few case-studies. The expert systems deploying the GIFSS would obviate the risk of serious errors in the decision-making.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses a few preliminaries and useful definitions related to IFS and IFSS. Section 3 introduces GIFSS and presents its properties. A novel score function and a similarity measure for comparison of two GIFSSs are provided in Section 4. Section 5 is concerned with the concept of generalized intuitionistic fuzzy relations (GIFSR) on GIFSS and its relevant properties. Section 6 presents an approach based on GIFSS to solve the supplier selection problem. A real case study involving supplier selection problem is given in this section. Section 7 shows the utility of the GIFSS in the decision making by solving two supplier selection problems using the similarity measure, proposed in Section 4. An application of generalized intuitionistic fuzzy relations (GIFSR) in solving a medical diagnosis problem is shown in Section 8. Finally, Section 9 gives conclusions of this paper.Fuzzy logic has become an inevitable part of multi criteria decision making because of the need to represent the associated uncertainty. To cater to the increased role of fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets have been extended in the literature leading to type-2 fuzzy sets [28], interval type-2 fuzzy sets [29], vague sets [30], probabilistic fuzzy sets [31], fuzzy soft sets [5] and intuitionistic fuzzy sets [1]. Recently, intuitionistic fuzzy sets have attracted considerable attention in the fuzzy decision making involved in supply chain management [32], medical pattern recognition [33] and urban planning [34]. The soft sets are also making in-roads into the decision making. In this section, we will lay emphasis on IFS and soft sets for the knowledge representation in the vague decision making. This will pay the way for introducing the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (GIFSS).We first start with the definitions of intuitionistic fuzzy sets and fuzzy soft sets [1,3,4,11] and then moot the concept of generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets followed by the detailed description in the later sections.The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy sets has been introduced by Atanassov [1] to take account of hesitancy of the observer. Let X={x1, x2,…,xn} be a fixed finite non-empty set. Then a IFS [1]A={xi, tA(xi), fA(xi)|xi∈X} where the functions tA: X→[0,1] and fA: X→[0,1] denote the degree of membership and the degree of non-membership of element x∈X to A respectively, such that for every x∈X: 0≤tA(x)+fA(x)≤1. Also πA(x)=1−(tA(x)+fA(x)) is called the degree of hesitation or indeterminacy of x to A, where tA∈[0,1], fA∈[0,1], and tA(x)+fA(x)+≤1.An intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN)a˜;, consists of three components: membership grade denoted asta˜;, non membership grade denoted byfa˜;, and hesitancy parameters denoted byπa˜;. Since the hesitancy component can be determined from the other two components asπa˜;=1−ta˜;−fa˜;, hesitancy component is omitted from IFN for convenience. Accordingly, IFNa˜;=(ta˜;,fa˜;), whereta˜;∈[0,1],fa˜;∈[0,1], andta˜;+fa˜;≤1. An IFN to IFSS is what a membership grade is to a fuzzy set.The operations on two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs)a˜;=(ta˜;,fa˜;)andb˜;=(tb˜;,fb˜;)[22,23] are:(1)a˜;⊕b˜;=(ta˜;+tb˜;−ta˜;⋅tb˜;,fa˜;⋅fb˜;)(2)a˜;⊗b˜;=(ta˜;⋅tb˜;,fa˜;+fb˜;−fa˜;⋅fb˜;)(3)λa˜;=(1−(1−ta˜;)λ,(fa˜;)λ),λ>0(4)(a˜;)λ=((ta˜;)λ,1−(1−fa˜;)λ),λ>0where ⊕ and ⊗ are the logical additive and multiplicative operations.A set of n IFNs,a˜;i=(ta˜;i,fa˜;i)(i=1, 2,…,n) can be aggregated by applying the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) [9] operator of dimension n. The resultant is also an IFN given by(5)IFWAw(a˜;1,a˜;2,…,a˜;n)=(w1a˜;1⊕w2a˜;2…⊕wna˜;n)=1−∏i=1n(1−ta˜;i)wi,∏i=1n(fa˜;i)wiwhere, w=(w1, w2,…,wn)Tis the weight vector ofa˜;i(i=1, 2,…,n), with wi∈[0,1] and∑i=1nwi=1.If A and B are two IFSs in a fixed set X of the formxi,txi,fxi|xi∈X, then they satisfy the relations [1]:(6)A≤Biff∀x∈X,[tA(x)≤tB(x)andfA(x)≥fB(x)]A=Biff∀x∈X,[tA(x)=tB(x)andfA(x)=fB(x)]A⊆BiffA≤BA¯={x,fA(x),tA(x)|x∈X}A∪B=x,(max(tA(x),tB(x)),min(fA(x),fB(x)))|x∈XA∩B=x,(min(tA(x),tB(x)),max(fA(x),fB(x)))|x∈XAn intuitionistic fuzzy relation (IFR) R (X→Y) from two IFSs X to Y is an IFS of the form X×Y characterized by the membership function tRand non-membership function, fR.Let A={〈x, tA(x), fA(x), πA(x)〉|x∈X}, B{〈x, tB(x), fB(x), πB(x)〉|x∈X}, be two IFSs in X={x1, x2, …, xn}. The distance between A and B can be found using the Hamming distance [24] or the Euclidean distance [24], as shown:(7)Hd(A,B)=12∑x∈X[|tA(x)−tB(x)|+|fA(x)−fB(x)|+|πA(x)−πB(x)|]Ed(A,B)=12∑x∈X[(tA(x)−tB(x))2+(fA(x)−fB(x))2+(πA(x)−πB(x))21/2Molodtsov has developed the theory of soft sets [3] as a parameterization tool for dealing with the uncertainties which the classical mathematical tools cannot handle. Owing to the absence of restrictions in the soft set theory it is easily applicable to practical decision making in economics, engineering, social science, medical science, etc. Maji et al. [4–6] have extended the fuzzy soft sets to the intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets to the solve decision making problems more effectively.A soft set is based upon the power set of the associated parameters on an initial universal set. Let U denote an initial universal set, E be a set of parameters and P (U) be the power set of U. Let A⊆E. Then the pair (C, A) is called a soft set [3] over U iff C is a mapping C: A→P (U).A fuzzy soft set [4] is defined on the fuzzy power subset of U. Let IUbe the power set of all fuzzy subsets of U. A pair (F, A) is called a fuzzy soft set over U, where F is a mapping F: A→IU.An intuitionistic fuzzy soft set IFU[4] extends the concept of fuzzy soft sets to the intutionistic case. Let IFUbe the collection of all intuitionistic fuzzy subsets of U. A pair (I, A) is called intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) over U, where I is a mappingI˜;:A→IFU. We will show a few examples on the different types of sets defined above.Example 2.1Let U={a1, a2, a3, a4} be a set of patients and E={fever (e1), loss-of-appetite (e2), body-ache (e3)} be the set of symptoms. Let A⊆E denote a select list of symptoms useful for the diagnosis. A={e1, e3}⊂E.Then, (C, A)=[C(e1)={a1, a3, a4}, C(e3)={a2, a3}] is the crisp soft set over U that describes the patients who exhibit the select list of symptoms. Instead, if we have a fuzzy mapping, F: A→IU with each criterion having a fuzzy membership for each sample of U, then an example of fuzzy soft set, (F, A), could be:[F(e1)={a1|0.8,a2|0.2,a3|0.5,a4|0.6},F(e3)={a1|0.1,a2|0.5,a3|0.8,a4|0.3}].(F, A) is the fuzzy soft set over U that describes the patients along with the value of membership function for each of the symptoms exhibited by them.If we have a mappingF˜;:A→IFUwith each criterion having a intuitionistic fuzzy membership for each sample of U, then an example of IFSS, (I, A), could be:[I(e1)={a1|(0.8,0.1),a2|(0.2,0.6),a3|(0.5,0.3),a4|(0.6,0.3)},I(e3)={a1|(0.1,0.6),a2|(0.5,0.2),a3|(0.8,0.1),a4|(0.3,0.6)}].(I, A) is the IFSS over U that points to the symptoms of patients and their respective membership function values in terms of IFNs. We can create any number of IFSS's depending upon the members of the power set.Here, we will show the usefulness of the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (GIFSS). Consider the statement: “Tom is tall”, where the concept “tall”, denoting a predicate for a range of heights, is fitted with a membership function μtall(u) that indicates the degree of tallness. However, the form of μtall(u) depends on the range of heights available to an observer. In contrast to this, the intuitionistic fuzzy logic facilitates an observer by way of the hesitancy factor in arriving at IFN for μtall(u). The hesitancy value comes from his background, experience, priorities or situation. Therefore, the uncertainty associated with an observer in the choice of membership grade needs to be further validated by a moderator, and this is the main motivation for developing the concept of GIFSS.The intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IFSS) are meant to address the uncertainties associated with real life decision making situations. However, an IFSS is solely dependent on the membership and hesitancy values given by the observer. So the intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets are generalized by introducing the generalization parameter given by a moderator to validate the original intuitionistic fuzzy values. The GIFSS offers the membership function which is suitably moderated by the moderator. By incorporating a second opinion with the original IFNs, the possibility of gross misrepresentation of the uncertain information can be eliminated in the knowledge representation structures based solely on a single observer.With the advent of GIFSS, the evaluation of an alternative against the criteria in an IFSS is moderated with the generalization parameter. The moderated input information can really go a long way in improving the current expert systems by ensuring a higher accuracy in the final decisions. Without moderation, the original evaluation remains uncertified; this means that the veracity of the assessment is doubtful.In this section, we present the definitions of GIFSS and illustrate it through examples. The properties of GIFSS are also investigated. The relevance of GIFSS to the supplier selection and medical diagnosis will be ascertained.A few basic definitions related to GIFSS are introduced and clarified through examples.Definition 3.1Let U denote the universal set of elements and E={e1, e2,…,em} be the universal set of parameters. The pair (U, E) is called as a soft universe. Then A⊆E and IF denote an IFS. A generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (GIFSS),F˜;α˜;over the soft universe (U, E) is defined as a mappingF˜;α˜;:A→IFUXIFof IFU, the collection of all intuitionistic fuzzy subsets of U and the generalization parameter,α˜;:A→IF=(ta˜;,fa˜;).The GIFSS is of the formF˜;α˜;(ei)=(F˜;(ei),α˜;(ei)),suchthatα˜;:A→IF=(tα˜;,fα˜;)where,α˜;(ei)indicates the moderator's assessment over the elements of U inF˜;(ei).(8)F˜;:A→IFU,F˜;(ei)∈IFU,α˜;(ei)∈IFtα˜;∈[0,1],fα˜;∈[0,1],tα˜;+fα˜;≤1Example 3.1Recall from Example 2.1, U={a1, a2, a3, a4}, E={fever (e1), loss-of-appetite (e2), body-ache (e3)} and A={e1, e3}⊂E. The generalization parameterα˜;:A→IFis defined for each criterion of the soft set. Thus one could haveα˜;(e1)=(0.6,0.3)andα˜;(e3)=(0.3,0.5). Its value is provided by a junior doctor (moderator). The GIFSSF˜;α˜;proceeds as follows:The generalization parameter is indicated in the bold. The GIFSS obtained above is used by a specialist to make the final diagnosis. The procedure to make the diagnosis will be discussed in Section 8.Definition 3.2LetF˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;be two GIFSSs over the soft universe (U, E) withα˜;andδ˜;as the two respective generalization parameters. Now,G˜;δ˜;is called as the sub set of GIFSSF˜;α˜;(bigger one), i.e.G˜;δ˜;⊆F˜;α˜;, ifConsider againF˜;α˜;of Example 3.1. LetG˜;δ˜;be another GIFSS over (U, E). Show thatG˜;δ˜;is a subset ofF˜;α˜;.Note that the square brackets contain the two components of GIFSS and the curly braces contain only one component. It can be seen that the IFNs corresponding to (a1, a2,…,a4) have lesser magnitude inG˜;δ˜;than those inF˜;α˜;. In the light of Definition 3.2,G˜;δ˜;, is an intuitionistic fuzzy subset ofF˜;α˜;.Definition 3.3The inverse ofF˜;α˜;,denoted byFα˜;i(e)easily follows from (8). It is given asThe inverse ofF˜;α˜;(e1)in Example 3.1 isF˜;α˜;i(e1){{a1|(0.1, 0.8), a2|(0.6, 0.2), a3|(0.3, 0.5), a4|(0.5, 0.4)}, (0.3, 0.6)}Definition 3.4The complement ofF˜;α˜;,denoted byF˜;α˜;c,is defined asThe union ofF˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;, denoted byF˜;α˜;U˜;G˜;δ˜;, is defined as:The intersection ofF˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;, denoted byF˜;α˜;∩˜;G˜;δ˜;, is given as:Find the union of the two sets of GIFSS,P˜;α˜;(e)andQ˜;δ˜;(e)by adapting the standard union operation defined in (6) for two sets of IFS.It is computed as follows:[P˜;α˜;(e1){(a1|(0.6,0.2),a2|(0.1,0.3),a3|(0.4,0.4),a4|(0.5,0.5)),(0.3,0.5)},P˜;α˜;(e3)={(a1|(0.4,0.2),a2|(0.9,0.1),a3|(0.3,0.6),a4|(0.6,0.1)),(0.5,0.5)}][Q˜;δ˜;(e1){(a1|(0.5,0.3),a2|(0.7,0.2),a3|(0.3,0.6),a4|(0.8,0.1)),(0.6,0.2)},Q˜;δ˜;(e3)={(a1|(0.8,0.1),a2|(0.2,0.6),a3|(0.7,0.1),a4|(0.3,0.3)),(0.1,0.8)}]LetP˜;α˜;(e)∪˜;Q˜;δ˜;(e)=R˜;v˜;(e), ∀e∈E. Then, in the light of Definition 3.5 the union operation provides us with the following GIFSS as[R˜;v˜;(e1)={(a1|(0.6,0.2),a2|(0.7,0.2),a3|(0.4,0.4),a4|(0.8,0.1)),(0.6,0.2)},R˜;v˜;(e3)={(a1|(0.8,0.1),a2|(0.9,0.1),a3|(0.7,0.1),a4|(0.6,0.1)),(0.5,0.5)}]Example 3.5Find the intersection of the two sets of GIFSS,P˜;α˜;(e)andQ˜;δ˜;(e)by adapting the standard intersection operator in (6).LetP˜;α˜;(e)∩˜;Q˜;δ˜;(e)=S˜;v˜;(e), ∀e∈E. Then, in the light of Definition 3.6 the intersection operation provides us with the following GIFSS.[S˜;v˜;(e1)={(a1|(0.5,0.3),a2|(0.1,0.3),a3|(0.3,0.6),a4|(0.5,0.5)),(0.3,0.5)},S˜;v˜;(e3)={(a1|(0.4,0.2),a2|(0.2,0.6),a3|(0.3,0.6),a4|(0.3,0.3)),(0.1,0.8)}]Definition 3.7A GIFSSΦ˜;θ˜;(e)=(F˜;(e),θ˜;(e))is said to be a generalized intuitionistic null fuzzy soft setA GIFSSA˜;α˜;(e)=(F˜;(e),α˜;(e))is said to be a generalized intuitionistic absolute fuzzy soft set,A few properties of GIFSS are enlisted in the following theorems:Theorem 3.1LetF˜;γ˜;be a GIFSS over (U, E), thenThe above follow trivially from Definitions 3.1–3.7.LetF˜;γ˜;,G˜;δ˜;andH˜;v˜;be any three sets of GIFSS over (U, E), then the commutative and associative properties hold good:The above properties of∪˜;and∩˜;trivially follow from the above definitions.When t-conorm (°) and t-norm (*) assume the union and intersection operations, then the distributive properties also hold true:Since∪˜;(max/union) and∩˜;(min/intersection) as defined in (6) are commutative and associative, the above properties hold good.In addition to the above, the complementary properties are also satisfiedDefinitions 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 help to see their equality.LetF˜;γ˜;be any GIFSS over (U, E) withG˜;δ˜;being its subset, then in the light of t-conorm (°) and t-norm (*) taking the union and intersection respectively, we can state:Definitions 3.4 and 3.5 are required to be invoked to prove their equality.In several areas such as pattern recognition, image processing, region extraction and coding theory, there is a need to compare two fuzzy numbers. A novel score function is devised here to compare two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). A similarity measure to compare two GIFSSs is also proposed.The new score function gives a greater emphasis to the larger of the membership and non-membership values of an IFN. This function is devised specifically keeping the medical diagnosis problems in mind. Xu [12] has developed a ranking method based on the values of the score function and the accuracy degrees of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Ye [13] ranks the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on the novel accuracy function. However in certain applications, these techniques giving equal weightage to both the components of an IFN, are not appropriate for the comparison of IFNs. Therefore, it is necessary to customize a score function specific to the application.Definition 4.1LetF˜;=(tf,ff),G˜;=(tg,fg)be two IFNs. The scores ofF˜;andG˜;are computed as:The accuracy degrees ofF˜;andG˜;are taken asHf=tf2+ff2, andHg=tg2+fg2respectively. Then the following conditions need to be fulfilled:(21)•IfΔF˜;<ΔG˜;,thenF˜;<G˜;;•IfΔF˜;=ΔG˜;,then∘IfHf=Hg,thenF˜;=G˜;;∘IfHf<Hg,thenF˜;<G˜;;In this score function, squaring the membership and non-membership values pronounces the larger component (effusing confidence) more than the smaller one.Example 4.1LetA˜;=(0.8,0.2)andA˜;=(0.8,0.2). Find the larger intuitionistic fuzzy number.Applying (21),ΔA˜;=0.64−0.04=0.60,ΔB˜;=0.81−0.01=0.80Clearly,B˜;is larger thanA˜;.A similarity measure is devised using the set theoretic approach to determine the similarity between two GIFSSs.Definition 4.2Let U={a1, a2,…,an} denote the universal set of elements and E={e1, e2,…,em} be the universal set of parameters. LetF˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;be the two GIFSSs over the soft universe (U, E), whereα˜;andδ˜;are the two generalizing parameters corresponding to the two sets of GIFSS. That is,Let the similarity between the fuzzy soft sets,F˜;andG˜;be denoted as T(F˜;,G˜;), and the similarity between the two generalization parametersα˜;andδ˜;be denoted as t(α˜;,δ˜;). Then the similarity between the two sets of GIFSSF˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;, denoted asSim(F˜;α˜;,G˜;δ˜;), is given by(22)Sim(F˜;α˜;,G˜;δ˜;)=T(F˜;,G˜;),t(α˜;,δ˜;),whent(α˜;,δ˜;)>0T(F˜;,G˜;),whent(α˜;,δ˜;)=0The terms in (22) and the parameters involved in them are expressed in the following:(23)T(F˜;,G˜;)=(Tmem(F˜;,G˜;)+Tnon−mem(F˜;,G˜;))2(24)Tmem(F˜;,G˜;)=1−Σj=1m|tF˜;α˜;(ej)−tG˜;α˜;(ej)|Σj=1m|tF˜;α˜;(ej)+tG˜;α˜;(ej)|;Tnon−mem(F˜;,G˜;)=1−Σj=1m|fF˜;α˜;(ej)−fG˜;α˜;(ej)|Σj=1m|fF˜;α˜;(ej)+fG˜;α˜;(ej)|(25)t(α˜;,δ˜;)=1−Σ|α˜;i−δ˜;i|Σ(α˜;i+δ˜;i)(26)αi=tα˜;(ei)tα˜;(ei)+fα˜;(ei),δ˜;i=tδ˜;(ei)tδ˜;(ei)+fδ˜;(ei)Example 4.2Find the similarity between the two GIFSSs,P˜;α˜;(e)andQ˜;δ˜;(e)as specified in Example 3.4.The GIFSSs,P˜;α˜;(e)andQ˜;δ˜;(e)of the first sample a1 and E={e1, e3} can be represented in the matrix form as follows:P˜;α˜;=0.60.40.20.20.30.50.50.5,Q˜;δ˜;=0.50.80.30.10.60.10.20.8t(α˜;,δ˜;)=1−0.38+0.391.12+0.61=0.55,Tmem(F˜;,G˜;)=1−0.1+0.41.1+1.2=0.78,Tnon−mem(F˜;,G˜;)=1−0.1+0.10.5+0.3=0.75Hence,T(F˜;,G˜;)=(0.78+0.75)2=0.77So we have,Sim(F˜;α˜;,G˜;δ˜;)=0.77×0.55=0.42.The notion of intuitionistic fuzzy soft relation (IFSR) is generalized to GIFSR in the context of GIFSS. The concept of GIFSR is illustrated through simple examples and the properties of GIFSR are investigated in detail.Definition 5.1An intuitionistic fuzzy soft relation (IFSR)R˜;between two IFSSs,F˜;andG˜;over soft universes (U, E) and (U, D) respectively, is defined [10] as:A generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft relation (GIFSR)R˜;τ˜;between two sets of GIFSS,F˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;over the soft universes (U, E) and (U, D) respectively, is defined as:LetR˜;1be a GIFSR between two GIFSSs,F˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;over the soft universes (U, E) and (U, D) respectively. LetR˜;2be a GIFSR between the GIFSSs,G˜;δ˜;andH˜;k˜;over the soft universes (U, D) and (U, L) respectively. Then the composition ofR˜;1andR˜;2is defined asThe application of union, intersection and inverse operations onR˜;1andR˜;2, results into:Recall U={a1, a2, a3, a4} as the set of patients and E={fever (e1), loss-of-appetite (e2), body-ache (e3)} as the set of symptoms. The severity of the symptoms as reported by the patients to a moderator (junior doctor) is represented by a GIFSS denoted asF˜;α˜;. The patients report their severity to another junior doctor when this exercise is repeated and the corresponding GIFSS is denoted asG˜;δ˜;. Find all the possible GIFSRs betweenF˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;for any two symptoms. The GIFSSs,F˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;, are as follows:LetR˜;i:K→IFU×IF, be the ith GIFSR betweenF˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;. Applying (21), the GIFSRs betweenF˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;can be derived as in Table 1.In Table 1, the first column lists the possible combinations of three symptoms taken two at a time. The last column contains the generalization parameter indicating the level of confidence of a moderator in the intuitionistic fuzzy values provided by patients. Each row gives a GIFSR between the GIFSSs,F˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;for any two symptoms. The rows in Table 1 give the GIFSRs between pairs of symptoms from E. For instance, the GIFSR (in accordance with (28)), of row 2 isR˜;v˜;(e1,e2)=F˜;α˜;(e1)∩˜;G˜;δ˜;(e2),where e1∈E and e2∈E,R˜;v˜;:K→IFU×IFis a GIFSS over (U, K), K⊆E×E.Note:F˜;α˜;andG˜;δ˜;are defined on the same soft universe (U, E); e1∈E, e2∈E.Selection of the best supplier is of utmost importance for the success of an organization because of the impact of the decisions made on cost, manufacturing, service, efficiency and overall satisfaction of the customers. It is often a difficult decision to select the best supplier as multiple criteria are involved and these are often conflicting. The importance of supplier selection for the businesses is also testified by the numerous studies in the literature [18–21]. In the supplier selection problems, evaluation of the suppliers is done based on various criteria by experts. The goal is to select the best alternative out of the many on the basis of their evaluation against each of the criteria: domain experience, quality of manpower, estimated cost etc.Imprecision, vagueness and lack of sufficient information are almost inherent in all decision making processes. Many studies have addressed this imprecision through fuzzy theory or intuitionistic fuzzy theory. It is pertinent to note that all the supplier selection problems rely upon the evaluation of suppliers against various criteria by experts. It may also be noted that the possibility of errors occurring in the evaluation of alternatives cannot be ruled out. In the existing literature, there is hardly any mechanism to handle the errors in the judgment of experts. Intuitionistic fuzzy environment makes use of the hesitancy of the experts in arriving at the judgment, but the hesitancy does not guarantee the fool-proof judgment. The possible errors in the evaluation of the suppliers are bound to have repercussions which lead to an incorrect choice of the best supplier.GIFSS addresses this issue by accommodating a moderator's opinion about the evaluation of an alternative against the criteria. A moderator can be viewed as a domain expert having years of experience. The moderator's opinion indicates the credibility of the evaluation of the alternative by the experts. This opinion coming from the moderator constitutes the generalization parameter. The uniqueness of the proposed GIFSS is in its ability to retain the original evaluation of the alternatives by the experts as well as the moderator's opinion. The notion of GIFSS has been devised in an attempt to reduce the possibility of errors in the evaluation by experts. This would also help to weed out any discrepancies in the evaluations of the alternatives, leading to a final uniform evaluation. Hence the decision arrived at after deploying the proposed framework is likely to be more accurate than the ones obtained through the existing methods.An application of GIFSS and the related concepts in a real example on the supplier selection is taken up in this section. To this end, an algorithm is developed to find the best supplier using the GIFSS and applied on the real data. Note that the supplier selection problem is characterized by multiple alternatives, criteria and vague assessments. Often, the experts assign scores to each alternative against the criteria. However, there is a little scope to take into account the hesitancy of the experts. An algorithm is developed below to carry out supplier selection using GIFSS.Consider a decision making problem with a collection of alternatives {a1, a2,…,an} and multiple criteria, {e1, e2,…,em}. Each alternative is assessed by a committee of experts against each of the criteria. The assessment of alternative aiagainst the criterion ejis given by an IFN,a˜;ij. Besides the experts’ evaluation, the management (board of directors) also has its say on each alternative. The board of directors assigns a generalization parameter to each alternative that moderates the evaluation by the experts’ committee. The algorithm consists of the following steps.Step 1: Generate the framework of the experts’ assessment matrix with the rows representing the alternatives and the columns representing the criteria.Step 2: Give an IFN assigned by the experts’ committee on each alternative against each of the criteria.Step3: Generate the intuitionistic fuzzy assessment matrix [M]n×m with the values of experts’ evaluation. An entry(a˜;ij)in the matrix [M]n×m is a triplet denoting the assessment of alternative aiagainst the criterion ejin terms of IFN.Step 4: Add the value of generalization parameterg˜;i(tg˜;i,fg˜;i)for ith alternative ai. This results in a new matrix [G]n×(m+1) with addition of a column in the matrix [M]n×m.Step 5: Compute the net aggregated evaluation,Zg˜;i(a˜;i1,a˜;i2,…,a˜;im)of alternative ai, asZg˜;i(a˜;i1,a˜;i2,…,a˜;im)=g˜;i⊗IFWA(a˜;i1,a˜;i2,…,a˜;im)Applying (5) and (2), we get(33)Zg˜;i(a˜;i1,a˜;i2,…,a˜;im)=[(tg˜;i,fg˜;i)]⊗1−∏j=1m(1−ta˜;ij)wi,∏j=1m(fa˜;ij)wi,=tg˜;i⋅1−∏j=1m(1−ta˜;ij)wi,fg˜;i+∏j=1m(fa˜;ij)wi−fg˜;i⋅∏j=1m(fa˜;ij)wiStep 6: Rank the alternatives as per the decreasing values ofZg˜;iby applying (21).To solve a real example of supplier selection the above algorithm is applied. The Ministry of Home Affairs of India invites bids to implement a program for the introduction of e-Governance in Police Stations through the design and development of a Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS). The executing agency of the ministry constituted for implementing the project is called National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). All responsive bids shall be subjected to a three stage detailed technical scrutiny by NCRB.Stage 1: Pre-qualification/Eligibility stage: All bids found meeting the bid submission format are subjected to detailed scrutiny in respect of conformance to the pre-qualification/eligibility criteria. The bidders whose bids are found to be complying with the pre-qualification criteria are said to be eligible, and the rest are eliminated.Stage 2: Technical Examination: Credentials of all such bidders who are found eligible in Stage 1 are scrutinized on the basis of the evaluation criteria provided in Table 2. A committee of domain experts of NCRB assigns an evaluation score to each prospective bidder on the basis of this technical examination.Stage 3: Technical Presentation: The management team of NCRB conducts a 2 hour technical presentation of the eligible bidders and assigns a presentation score to each of the bidders.The alternative having the best technical proposal is determined by deploying the concept of GIFSS and the algorithm presented above. The results obtained are compared with those obtained originally by applying the numerical scores as well as with the results obtained through the IFSS approach.Note:The scope of this example is restricted to finding the best technical proposal only. In the original application, a technical bid is also accompanied by a commercial bid, and a combined evaluation of the two bids results in the final decision of the best supplier. Also, for the sake of confidentiality, bidders are designated as a1, a2,…,anrather than by their original identities.The concept of GIFSS is now utilized by applying the above approach in the following steps.Step 1: In Stage 1 of the evaluation process, the pre-qualification bids of the bidders are evaluated. Only 4 bidders are qualified for competition being eligible. As seen from Table 2, there are 5 criteria against which the alternatives need to be assessed. The experts’ assessment matrix can be generated as shown in Table 3.Step 2: In Stage 2, the committee of experts of NCRB evaluates each alternative against each of the criteria and assigns a score. This assessment is converted into an IFN by accommodating the experts’ hesitancy in assigning this score. For instance, the experts’ hesitancy for the criterion e1 is 0.2. The membership componentta˜;ijof the IFN is found from the following relation.ta˜;ij=EvaluationscoreMaxscoreTables 4–7show the evaluation scores and the IFNs assigned to the alternatives.Step 3: The IFNs assigned to the pre-qualified bidders against the criteria are summarized in the intuitionistic fuzzy assessment matrix [M]4×4, as shown in Table 8. The IFNs in Table 8 are given by the NCRB experts.Step 4: In the Stage 3, the management team of NCRB assigns a value for the generalization parameterg˜;i(tg˜;i,fg˜;i)for ith alternative ai. This results in a new GIFSS matrix [G]4×6 with addition of a column in the matrix [M]n×m. The matrix [G]4×6 is shown in Table 9. Theg˜;imoderates the reported intuitionistic evaluation scores.Step 5: The net aggregated evaluation,Zg˜;i(a˜;i1,a˜;i2,……,a˜;im)of alternative aiis computed using (33).Zg˜;i(a˜;i1,a˜;i2,a˜;i3,a˜;i4,a˜;i5)=tg˜;i.1−∏j=15(1−ta˜;ij)wi,fg˜;i+∏j=15(fa˜;ij)wi−fg˜;i.∏j=15(fa˜;ij)wiSince all the criteria are of equal weightage, the weight vector is taken as (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). The net aggregated evaluationZg˜;ifor the alternatives is given in Table 10.Step 6: The alternatives are ranked as per the decreasing values ofZg˜;iby applying (21). The ranking is obtained asa4>a3>a2>a1The effect of generalization parameter on the overall evaluation is seen by repeating the above exercise with IFSS (ignoring the generalization parameter). The intuitionistic fuzzy assessment matrix [M]4×5, is given in Table 8. The net aggregated evaluation,Zi=IFWA(a˜;i1,a˜;i2,……,a˜;im)for the alternative aiis computed as per (5). The net aggregated evaluation Zifor the alternatives is given in Table 11.The ranking for the alternatives obtained isa4>a3>a1>a2.The generalization parameter moderates the evaluation by the experts. The effect of the generalization parameter can easily be found. For instance, the alternatives, a4 and a3 are quite close to the original evaluation score (without the generalization parameter) with values (0.886, 0.000) and (0.871, 0.000) respectively. However, this gap can be reduced with the help of GIFSS. As far as, the alternatives a1 and a2, are concerned, a1 is leading a2 with the IFSS approach, but with the introduction of generalization parameter, a2 precedes a1.The results obtained through our approach are compared with those obtained through the simple method of assigning the scores. The evaluation score matrix [M]4×6 for the pre-qualified bidders is shown in Table 12. An entry in a cell {i–j} of the matrix [M]n×m is denoted by mijwhich is a numerical value.The last column gives the generalization parameter githat moderates the evaluation score which is a numerical value out of 10. In order to draw an analogy between our approach and the method of assigning numerical values for scores, the net moderated value is arrived at using a relation similar to the one used in our approach.(34)Zgi(mi1,mi2,mi3,mi4,mi5)=1∑j=15emaxscoregi×∑j=15mijwhere, emax score denotes the maximum score for a criterion and mijdenotes the {i–j}th entry in the matrix. [M]4×6.The moderated evaluation scores obtained by applying (34) are given in Table 13.The ranking obtained for the alternatives in this case is,a4>a3>a1>a2It can be observed that the GIFSS adequately handles the vague assessments along with the hesitancy of experts. The experts’ assessments are further moderated by the management team which gives the final decision. In the method of assigning numerical scores, there is no provision to incorporate the hesitancy of the experts or the opinion of the management team. This accounts for the difference in the results obtained through two approaches.The potential of GIFSS is further highlighted through two case-studies that use the similarity measure discussed in Section 4. The case-studies deal with finding the best supplier.A prominent MNC wants to select the most suitable supplier for the construction of a new building. Three bidders have been shortlisted after the initial round of bids. The parameters against which the bidders are evaluated by the experts are denoted by the set, E={e1: Domain Expertise, e2: Quality of manpower, e3: Estimated Cost, e4: Brand value}. The overall confidence of the management in the bidder is given by the generalization parameter that indicates the reliability of the reported information.The ideal supplier is represented in Table 14. The IFN values for the ideal supplier, which reflect the ideal qualities being sought in the suppliers, are provided by the management team of the MNC.The evaluations of the suppliers in terms of GIFSS are given in Tables 15–17. The values of IFNs in Tables 15–17 are provided by the experts, depending upon their assessment of the alternatives against the criteria under consideration.In this example, we will find the supplier which is closest to the ideal supplier, the GIFSS representation of which is arrived at by the top management of the company.The GIFSSs in Tables 15–17 are compared with the one in Table 14 by calculating the similarity measure, given in Definition 4.2. The threshold of the similarity may be decided by the company. The supplier with the similarity measure above this threshold is considered the best choice out of all the available suppliers.Computing the similarity measure for Supplier1, we have from (23),T(I˜;,P˜;)=(Tmem(I˜;,P˜;)+Tnon−memI˜;,P˜;)2Applying (24),(35)Tmem(I˜;,P˜;)=1−0.1+0.1+0.1+0.11.7+1.7+1.5+1.9=0.94;Tnon−mem(I˜;,P˜;)=1−0+0+0+0.10.2+0.2+0.4+0.1=0.88Substituting values from (35) in (23), we get(37)T(I˜;,P˜;)=0.94+0.882=0.91From (25),(38)t(σ˜;,α˜;)=1−∑|σ˜;i−α˜;i|∑(σ˜;i+αi)Therefore,t(α˜;,δ˜;)=1−0.6+0.4+0.5+0.31.4+1.6+1.5+1.7=0.71Substituting values from (37) and (38) in (22), we get,Sim(I˜;σ˜;,P˜;α˜;)=0.97×0.71=0.64The similarity of supplier2 with the ideal supplier is computed as,Sim(I˜;σ˜;,Q˜;β˜;)=0.31Similarly, the similarity of Supplier3 with the ideal supplier is,Sim(I˜;σ˜;,R˜;δ˜;)=0.18Result: It is observed that Supplier1 is closest to the ideal supplier with the highest value of the similarity measure as 0.64. Supplier2 and Supplier3 with the values of similarity measure as 0.31 and 0.18 follow Supplier1 in the same order.The effect of the generalization parameter is now studied by solving the Case-study 2 through the IFSS approach (without the generalization parameter).Computing the similarity measure for Supplier1, from (23),T(I˜;,P˜;)=(Tmem(I˜;,P˜;)+Tnon−memI˜;,P˜;)2Applying (24),(39)Tmem(I˜;,P˜;)=1−0.1+0.1+0.1+0.11.7+1.7+1.5+1.9=0.94;Tnon−mem(I˜;,P˜;)=1−0+0+0+0.10.2+0.2+0.4+0.1=0.88Substituting values from (39) in (23), we get the similarity measure as(40)Sim(I˜;,P˜;)=T(I˜;,P˜;)=0.94+0.882=0.94We now compute the similarity of Supplier2 with the ideal supplier as,Sim(I˜;,Q˜;)=0.63.And that of Supplier3 with the ideal supplier as,Sim(I˜;,R˜;)=0.25.In order to see the effect of generalization parameter on the overall similarity degree, we retain the values of the intuitionistic fuzzy soft set, (tP˜;α˜;andfP˜;α˜;) corresponding to Supplier1 in Table 15, while modifying the values of the generalization parameter (tα˜;andfα˜;). The modified GIFSS for Supplier1 is given in Table 18.The similarity of Supplier1 with the ideal supplier, given in Table 14, is computed as.T(I˜;,P˜;)=0.91andt(σ˜;,α˜;)=0.90.Applying (22), we getSim(I˜;σ˜;,P˜;α˜;)=0.91×0.90=0.83This exercise is repeated by choosing the value of generalization parameter as (1, 0) for all the criteria, as shown in Table 19.Applying (22), we get,Sim(I˜;σ˜;,P˜;α˜;)=0.91.Result: It is observed that with the increase in the generalization parameter values for the criteria e1, e2 and e3, there is a profound effect on the similarity value between Supplier1 and the ideal supplier. The value of similarity measure increases from 0.64 to 0.83 in the new scenario. On similar lines, when the generalization parameter attains the maximum value of (1, 0) for every criterion, then the similarity value remains the same (at 0.91) as in IFSS (without the presence of the generalization parameter).It is seen that the effect of generalization parameter is quite evident in the similarity measure for GIFSSs. For instance, the similarity values for Supplier1, Supplier2 and Supplier3 are 0.91, 0.63 and 0.25 respectively, originally. After the introduction of the generalization parameters in the three suppliers, the similarity values get reduced to 0.64, 0.31 and 0.18. In a GIFSS, when value of the generalization parameter is (1, 0) for each criterion, the similarity measure corresponding to a supplier remains the same as the one in IFSS.As observed from the similarity degrees, Supplier2 and Supplier3 are quite away from the ideal supplier. If the company recommends a minimum threshold of 0.5, then Supplier1 would become a potential candidate with the similarity matching with the ideal supplier. The results can also be validated intuitively. While the IFS values in Supplier1 are the closest to the ideal candidate given in Table 14, those in Supplier3 are quite different from the values in Table 10.It may be noted that the generalization parameter also plays a significant role in deciding the overall similarity of the two suppliers. In Case-study 3, we retain the original IFSS values, and increase the generalization parameter values for three parameters e1, e2 and e3 keeping the original values of e4. The effect of the change can be seen in the similarity degree rising from 0.64 to 0.83.GIFSS can be effectively used to reduce the errors encountered in medical diagnosis. These errors often turn out to be quite serious to the victims. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes medical errors as having fatal consequences on the patients. As reported by WHO, one in 10 hospital admissions involves an error and one in 300 admissions results in death due to wrong diagnosis. This claim is also reinforced by the British National Health System survey in 2009 [35] which reports that 15% of its patients are misdiagnosed. Earlier, an American study published in the ‘Journal of the American Medical Association’ in the year 2000 has quantified this problem most effectively. The study shows that 2000 deaths occur every year from unnecessary surgery; 7000 deaths from medication errors; 20,000 from other errors; and 80,000 from infections in hospitals; and 106,000 deaths every year from non-error, adverse effects of medications. In all, 225,000 deaths occur every year in US due to unintentional medical errors.Another WHO report [14], released on 22 April 2011 concludes that the lack of time on the part of specialists as one of the primary reasons for wrong diagnoses. An example of a 10-year-old leukemia patient in Britain who died because of a series of unintended changes due to a wrong chemotherapy injection given to him further supports the point and justifies the wide potential of GIFSS in improving the present state of the medical expert systems for medical diagnosis.We now throw some light on the use of GIFSS in improving the medical diagnosis. A doctor bases his diagnosis largely on the symptoms reported by patients. The symptoms revealed by a patient to the doctor may not convey the real facts due to lack of appropriate terminology, communication skills, etc. For example, a patient might describe the severity of one of the symptoms as very high but this may not coincide with the one prevalent in the standard medical practice. On prodding further, the patient may reveal in detail about his symptoms. The specialist may not have enough time to extract more accurate information by probing the patient. It may be more pertinent to have a junior doctor examine the patient, who acting as a moderator can assign an additional fuzzy value called generalization parameter to moderate the severity of the symptoms described by a patient. The severity of symptoms as reported by the patients in the linguistic form as membership grades can be used in the intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IFSS).The generalization parameter can significantly aid the current medical expert systems by providing a moderation of the input information regarding the symptoms of patients, which reduces the effect of errors due to any misreporting. This moderation can be done by a junior doctor based upon his assessment before a specialist arrives on the scene for the final diagnosis. For presenting further the usefulness and potential of the GIFSS approach, we look at an actual case of the neurology department of a hospital. The patient reports the symptoms: Blurred vision, high fatigue, short period of unconsciousness, slow pulse, acute anxiety, and slight nausea. These symptoms are wrongly diagnosed as epilepsy and the patient is administered a strong dose. It is only later when the patient is further probed for the degree of severity of each symptom that the real severity has been revealed in medical terms. The true severities of the symptoms as assessed by the junior doctor are: Blurred vision, high fatigue, very short period of unconsciousness, lower range of normal pulse, moderate anxiety, and moderate nausea.The real cause of the problem is identified as the patient's disposition to low sugar level. In this example we can see that the symptoms of two versions of symptoms are closely related. In order to come up with the correct diagnosis, a patient's version of the symptoms should be moderated by a junior doctor having a better knowledge about medical science before the specialist mulls over the information to arrive at the correct diagnosis. The moderation is also useful as the specialists are fewer in number and can afford only a limited time for a patient.With the aim of diagnosing multiple patients, {P1, P2,…,Pm}, an algorithm for the development of a medical expert system is designed using the intuitionistic fuzzy medical knowledge derived from S (set of symptoms) to D (set of diagnoses), represented as GIFSR, i.e.R˜;(S→D). Rules of this form help in constructing a medical expert system and an algorithm to this end now follows.Step 1: Form a set of symptoms, S of patients. The cardinality of S is the number of symptoms observed in the patients, say n. Generate a matrix [Patients]m×(n+1) with each row representing the degree of severity as reported by a patient for the symptoms in the columns. The values of the generalization parameter gi given by a junior doctor towards the moderation of the severity degrees of the symptoms are contained in the last column of [Patients]m×(n+1). Each row along with gi is a GIFSS (of cardinality n) denoted asP˜;i(i=1,…,m). The higher the level of trust of the moderator in the symptoms reported by the patients, the higher is the value of the generalization parameter.Step 2: Formulate an expert medical knowledge matrix [Eexpert]n×p(with symptoms as rows and diseases as columns) in terms of diseases and their respective symptoms. This is supposedly given by a specialist, translating the medical knowledge into the degrees of membership, non-membership and hesitancy for symptoms of diseases considered. Since this is an expert knowledge, the generalization factor is taken to be the absolute IFS, i.e. (1, 0, 0).Step 3: Moderate the symptoms of patients using the generalization parameter by applying a suitable t-norm operation and generate the matrix[P′atients]m×n.Step 4: Generate the distance matrix [Dist]m×nby composing the matrices[P′atients]m×nand [Eexpert]n×pas per (28) and using the distance measure as per (7).Step 5: Diagnose each patient by identifying the lowest distance in each row of the matrix [Dist]m×n.Result: The disease with the lowest distance [Dist]m×nin a row is likely to be the diagnosis for a patient.A few recent works [15,16] on fuzzy based medical diagnosis expert systems rely solely on the symptoms reported by the patients. There is hardly any provision to accommodate any opinion of a moderator which sometimes could be crucial in diagnosing the disease correctly. The proposed method makes the diagnosis flexible by accommodating moderator's opinion.As noted earlier, the true assessment of the severity of the symptoms is most essential for the correct diagnosis. A patient unless probed for the severity of a symptom may overstate or understate the fuzzy/intuitionistic fuzzy membership grade, indicating the same. A moderator (a junior doctor) may probe further to ascertain the true severity as per the standard medical practice. It is quite likely that the moderator infers the actual severity as per medical standards, different from what the patient conveys. This happens primarily because of the fact that the terms used by a patient to represent the severity of each symptom as per his perception may not be consistent with the medical terminology.For example, the anxiety might be described by a patient as acute. But this may be considered as moderate in medical terminology. In order to bridge the gap between what is reported and what is interpreted, a moderator gives his assessment about the furnished data which is in the form of IFSS. The IFSS along with the moderator's assessment (the generalization parameter) become the GIFSS.A GIFSS has higher utility and flexibility than an IFSS due to its ability to represent both the severity of symptoms as reported by a patient to a moderator, and the degree of belongingness of these values as per the moderator's opinion. For instance, in situations where there is an uncertainty about the degree of the input information (like symptoms in the case of medical diagnosis problem), a moderator's inputs can really be crucial in coming up with the correct decision. In such situations, GIFSS is better suited to create an expert system from its knowledge base.In [15], the problem of medical diagnosis has been tackled under the intuitionistic fuzzy environment using the approach in [11]. However, the composition relation employed in [15] is not guaranteed to yield an IFN. We now solve a medical diagnosis problem involving a set of patients afflicted with a disease using their symptoms and expert medical knowledge as in [15] by applying GIFSS.We have here four patients, Tom, Bob, Ram and Edwin having the symptoms: fever, headache, stomach-pain, cough, and chest-pain. The patients are suffering from any one of the diseases from the set {Viral, Malaria, Typhoid, Stomach problem, Chest problem}. The following steps are performed to solve the problem.Step 1: The symptoms of the patients are tabulated in the matrix [Patients]4×6, in Table 20. The first column of Table 20 lists the names of patients and the next five columns contain their symptoms. The intuitionistic fuzzy values in the columns are furnished by the patients. The last column gives the values of the generalization parameter gi provided by the moderator.Step 2: The standard medical knowledge is formulated as the matrix [Eexpert]5×5, shown in Table 21. This is akin to the rules in an expert system. Here, the IFNs corresponding to each disease against various symptoms are provided by medical experts. Each symptom is described by the membership, the non-membership and the hesitation degrees. For instance, consider the chest problem where the temperature should be low (t=0.1, f=0.8, π=0.1), whereas the symptom of chest pain should be severe if (t=0.8, f=0.1, π=0.1). It may be noted that the values remain the same in Table 21 after moderation with the value of gias (1.0, 0.0, 0.0).Step 3: The moderated values of the symptoms for each patient are obtained by applying the ⊗ operator as per (2). The moderated values in the matrix[P′atients]4×5, are given in Table 22.Step 4: The distance matrix [Dist]4×5 is constructed by composing the matrices[P′atients]4×5and [Eexpert]5×5 as per (28) and using the distance measure as per (7). The matrix [Dist]4×5 is shown in Table 23.Step 5: The diagnosis for each patient is made by identifying the lowest distance in each row of the matrix [Dist]m×n.Result: It is found that Tom, Ram and Edwin suffer from Viral, while Bob has the stomach problem.The same case-study is conducted again with the IFSS (ignoring the generalization parameter) to see the influence of the generalization parameter on the final result. The distance matrix is computed as in Table 24.Result: Tom is diagnosed with Malaria, Ram with Typhoid, Bob with stomach problem and Edwin with Viral.The generalization parameter acts as a second level evaluation that effuses more confidence in the conclusions. For instance, the diagnosis made on Tom has turned out to be the same as that on Ram by the GIFSS approach as both are diagnosed as having viral (Table 23 with Tom having the least value of Dist[Tom, Viral] as 0.87 and Ram having the least value of Dist[Ram, Viral] as1.24) whereas Tom and Ram are diagnosed to have Malaria and Typhoid respectively by the IFSS approach (Table 24 with Tom having the least value of Dist as 1.25 and Ram having the least value of Dist as1.60). The diagnoses reached with the GIFSS approach are more trustworthy and convincing as the fuzzy values are moderated with a moderator's input at every stage of the diagnosis. Thus GIFSS is able to distinguish among the symptoms of diseases with the aid of moderator's opinion. It may be noted that in cases where marginal values are involved, a moderator's opinion could play a crucial role in avoiding the errors arising due to misreporting or lack of domain specific knowledge.In this example, it can be seen from Table 20 that the moderator has toned down the severity of the symptoms reported by Tom and Ram but retained the original severity values of Bob and Edwin.Note that with the IFSS approach, the decisions are made directly on the severities, reported by the patients. In view of this, the IFSS approach has no ability to correct. On the other hand GIFSS corrects the inconsistencies or exaggerations in the original data by way of the generalization parameter. It can be observed from Table 24 that the diagnoses by both the approaches on Bob and Edwin remain the same, since the moderator is in agreement with the severity values reported by the patients, and he does not moderate them significantly (gi=(0.9, 0.1, 0.0) for Bob and (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) for Edwin). In contrast to this, the moderator is not convinced of the severity values reported by Tom and Ram (gi=(0.6, 0.3, 0.1) for Tom and gi=(0.4, 0.4, 0.2) for Ram) hence he goes in for moderation which results in different diagnoses for Tom and Ram. Thus, the presence of the generalization parameter in the GIFSS imparts ability to correct the original diagnoses by accommodating the moderator's opinion.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper extends the Intutionisitc Fuzzy Soft Sets (IFSS) to the Generalized IFSS (GIFSS) by introducing the generalization parameter to the pool of the intutionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) of IFSS. The generalization parameter is a kind of the moderator's assessment on the presented information as IFNs. The role of moderator is to refine IFNs with his domain specific knowledge. It may be noted that the information of any sort often gets misinterpreted during its presentation. This usually happens as the presenter has no domain specific knowledge or lacks the standard terminologies and this is sought to be corrected by the proposed GIFSS.A new score function, particularly useful in medical applications, is devised to compare two IFNs such that the larger component (out of membership and non-membership) gets more prominence. A similarity measure for comparing two GIFSS has also been developed. Three algorithms are developed for application of GIFSS in the supplier selection and medical diagnosis problems.The first algorithm utilizes the generalization parameter to moderate the original intuitionistic fuzzy values. The moderated values are further processed to arrive at the ranking. The second algorithm makes use of the proposed similarity measure. It has been applied in two case studies on supplier selection. The GIFSS values for various alternatives are compared with those of the ideal supplier using this similarity. The alternatives are ranked in the order of their similarities with the ideal supplier. The third algorithm designed for the medical diagnosis problem employs GIFSS to moderate the symptoms reported by patients. The distance measures for the IFS are used to determine the diagnosis that is closest to the moderated symptoms displayed by a patient. The results obtained of the GIFSS approach are compared with those obtained through the IFSS.The effectiveness of the GIFSS approach is vindicated through the case studies.The structure of the generalization parameter can be tailored to tackle specific decision making problems in different domains. This would enlarge the scope of the proposed GIFSS approach by better accommodating inputs of a moderator leading to realization of a higher potential of GIFSS.
