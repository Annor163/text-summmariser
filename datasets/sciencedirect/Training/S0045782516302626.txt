@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) and T-splines can have some drawbacks when modelling damage and fracture. The use of Powell–Sabin B-splines, which are based on triangles, can by-pass these drawbacks. Herein, smeared as well as discrete approaches to fracture in quasi-brittle materials using Powell–Sabin B-splines are considered.For the smeared formulation, an implicit fourth-order gradient damage model is adopted. Since quadratic Powell–Sabin B-splines employC1-continuous basis functions throughout the domain, they are well-suited for solving the fourth order partial differential equation that emerges in this higher order damage model. Moreover, they can be generated from an arbitrary triangulation without user intervention. Since Powell–Sabin B-splines are generated from a classical triangulation, they are not necessarily boundary-fitting and in that case they are not isogeometric in the strict sense.For discrete fracture approaches, the degree of continuity of T-splines is reduced toC0at the crack tip. Hence, stresses need to be evaluated and weighted at the integration points in the vicinity of the crack tip in order to decide when the critical stress is reached. In practice, stress fields are highly irregular around crack tips. Furthermore, aligning a T-spline mesh with the new crack segment can be difficult. Powell–Sabin B-splines also remedy these drawbacks as they areC1-continuous at the crack tip and stresses can be directly computed, which vastly increases the accuracy and simplifies the implementation. Moreover, re-meshing is more straightforward using Powell–Sabin B-splines. A current limitation is that, in three dimensions, there is no procedure (yet) for constructing Powell–Sabin B-splines on arbitrary tetrahedral meshes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Discrete crack models capture crack initiation and propagation by introducing a geometric discontinuity in the domain. In order to model features like crack propagation in arbitrary directions and crack branching in finite element methods, re-meshing must be adopted in order to align the discretisation to the crack path  [1,2]. An interesting alternative is the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM), which also allows for arbitrary crack propagation, but positions extra degrees of freedom at existing nodes, thus preserving the original topology of the discretisation, see e.g.  [3,4] who used linear elastic fracture mechanics,  [5–7] who used cohesive zone models, or  [8,9] for the extension to crack propagation in fluid-saturated media.More recently, Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) and T-splines have been used for the modelling of crack initiation and propagation using the cohesive-zone approach  [10]. The idea of utilising spline functions, which are commonly used in Computer Aided Design (CAD) packages, also for analysis purposes was introduced in  [11,12], and is now commonly known as IsoGeometric Analysis (IGA). While in the original paper by Verhoosel et al.  [10] a number of interesting examples are shown of the power of the approach, structured T-splines may not be the optimal spline technology for modelling fracture in a discrete sense. This is because the initial mesh needs to be aligned a priori with the final crack path  [10], which is normally not known beforehand. A further drawback is that the blending functions of T-spline meshes are onlyC0-continuous at the crack tip. Thus, stresses have to be computed at integration points in the vicinity of the crack tip, which detracts from one of the advantages of using splines as basis functions compared to standard Lagrangian basis functions, namely that the accuracy of the stress computation is vastly superior. As a final point, it is noted that triangles are usually favoured for discrete fracture models since they are more flexible for re-meshing, while T-splines have a layout which is based on a quadrilateral structure. For these reasons a spline technology which is based on a triangulation, like Powell–Sabin B-splines  [13,14], is potentially more attractive for modelling discrete fracture. As an added benefit Powell–Sabin B-splines allow for a direct computation of the stress tensor at the crack tip since they areC1-continuous in the entire domain. It is noted though, that at present the extension to three dimensions is not trivial.The difficulties that adhere to discrete crack approaches, in particular in three-dimensional applications, have motivated the development of smeared crack models. They approximate the crack by introducing a damage-like variable and can be extended to three dimensions in a straightforward manner  [15]. In non-local and gradient damage models  [16–18] the ill-posedness of the boundary value problem that arises at a generic stage of the loading process when exploiting damage models or softening plasticity models, is removed by introducing a non-local quantity, e.g. a non-local equivalent strain. A computationally efficient setting is obtained by treating this non-local quantity as an independent variable, thus leading to a mixed problem.However, the introduction of non-locality carries some drawbacks. First, boundary conditions are required for the non-local equivalent strain. Furthermore, one or more internal length scale parameters are introduced. Finally, most higher order gradient models require basis functions of a continuity that is higher thanC0. To meet the latter requirement, NURBS and T-splines have been used in  [19]. It is noted, however, that their use may be less straightforward for more complicated geometries. Indeed, it is not always easy to preserve the higher continuity throughout the domain, for example when three or more than four NURBS-patches meet at an extraordinary point. In such cases, the use of Powell–Sabin B-splines can be more convenient since they provide basis functions that areC1-continuous throughout, and can be created from arbitrary triangulations.This paper starts with a concise introduction to Powell–Sabin B-splines. Next, gradient damage models are considered. Subsequently, Powell–Sabin B-splines are applied to discrete fracture using a cohesive zone model. Index notation has been used with respect to a Cartesian frame throughout the paper.In this section, we give a short introduction to Powell–Sabin B-splines. A more elaborate introduction into Powell–Sabin B-splines is given in  [20]. For computational efficiency, Bézier extraction is used for Powell–Sabin B-splines  [21].In order to obtain basis functions withC1-continuity for a triangulationT, some pre-processing steps are necessary. Each triangleeof the triangulationThas to be split into six (n=1…6) mini-triangles (cf  Fig. 1). This yields the Powell–Sabin refinementT∗. Powell–Sabin points (green) are now defined for each vertexkof the triangulationT: they are the vertexkitself and points that lie in the centre of edges ofT∗that contain the vertexk. A Powell–Sabin triangle (shown in red), which contains all Powell–Sabin points, is associated with each vertexk. The Powell–Sabin triangle needs to contain all Powell–Sabin points in order to get positive basis functions. Furthermore, the triangle needs to be small for a low condition number of the stiffness matrix. The Powell–Sabin triangles are chosen in such a way that they share two edges with the convex hull of the Powell–Sabin points  [22,23]. In this manner the solution of an expensive optimisation algorithm is avoided  [20]. We further constrain the Powell–Sabin triangles on the boundary as follows: for an angle ofγ<180°two edges of the Powell–Sabin triangle lie on the boundary; for an angle ofγ=180°, one edge of the Powell–Sabin triangle lies on the boundary,  Fig. 1. No restriction is imposed on Powell–Sabin triangles at an internal discontinuity (see also Section  4).After computing a Powell–Sabin triangle for each vertexk, the basis functions can be computed. Three (j=1,2,3) Powell–Sabin B-splinesNkjare associated with each vertexk, with coordinatesV¯k=(xk,yk)of the triangulationTand have the following properties. For anyl≠kwe have(1)Nkj(Vl)=0,∂∂xNkj(Vl)=0,∂∂yNkj(Vl)=0,and otherwise(2)Nkj(Vk)=αkj,∂∂xNkj(Vk)=βkj,∂∂yNkj(Vk)=γkj,with(3)∑j=13αkj=1,∑j=13βkj=0,∑j=13γkj=0.The coefficientsαkj,βkjandγkjin Eq. (3) can be obtained for each vertexkby solving(4)[αk1αk2αk3βk1βk2βk3γk1γk2γk3][xk1yk11xk2yk21xk3yk31]=[xkyk1100010],whereQ¯kj=(xkj,ykj)are the coordinates of the Powell–Sabin triangle corners that correspond to vertexk. Once the coefficientsαkj,βkjandγkjhave been determined, the Bézier ordinates can be computed in each mini-trianglenof elementefor the basis functionsN¯ne. The Bézier ordinates are assembled in the Bézier extraction operatorC¯¯ne. This allows for an efficient computation of the basis functions and their derivatives. For instance, the basis functionsN¯neare computed from(5)N¯ne=C¯¯neB¯,whereB¯is the vector containing the Bernstein polynomials. Further details on the calculation of the basis functionsN¯neusing Bézier extraction can be found in  [21].Special care must be taken for the selection of the Powell–Sabin triangles in order to pass the patch test. For instance, consider the triangulationTin Figs. 2(a) and (b) consisting of two elements. Figs. 2(a) and (b) show two different options for the bottom left Powell–Sabin triangle. The bottom left Powell–Sabin triangle in Fig. 2(b) is valid since it contains all Powell–Sabin points that correspond to the bottom left vertex. Both options yield an affine transformation when applying to the control pointsP¯i=Q¯ithe transformation(6)P¯Ti=A¯¯P¯i+b¯with the transformation matrixA¯¯, the displacement vectorb¯and the control pointsP¯Tiafter the transformation, as depicted in Figs. 2(c) and (d) since the basis functions fulfil the partition of unity property.The mesh in Fig. 2(a) also passes the patch test depicted in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 3(b) shows the contour of the basis function for the red control point corresponding to the mesh in Fig. 2(a). The basis function in Fig. 3(b) is zero along the left edge. Shifting the corner of the bottom left Powell–Sabin triangle as in Fig. 2(b) results in a different basis function for the red control point in Fig. 3(c): the basis function is now non-zero along the left edge. Furthermore, the mesh in Fig. 2(b) does not pass the patch test—applying the boundary conditions in Fig. 3(a) does not result in a constant stress in thex-direction.In this section, the formulation and numerical elaboration of the implicit higher order gradient damage model is given. Two examples are presented, including the advantages compared to NURBS and T-splines regarding the discretisation.Higher order gradient damage models require the solution of two coupled field problems. The first field problem to be solved is the equilibrium equation:(7)σij,i=0subject to the boundary conditions(8)σijnj=hion∂Ωh,ui=ūion∂Ωu,with the decomposition of the boundary∂Ωinto the parts∂Ωhand∂Ωu(∂Ωh∩∂Ωu=0̸,∂Ωh∪∂Ωu=∂Ω), and the prescribed surface tractionh, the prescribed displacementūand the normal vectornon the external boundary. The stress tensor is computed from(9)σij=(1−ω)Cijklεkl,withCthe elasticity tensor of the undamaged material, and(10)εij=12(ui,j+uj,i)the infinitesimal strain tensor.uis the displacement vector andω∈[0,1]is the scalar-valued damage parameter (ω=0in the undamaged state,ω=1in the fully damaged state). The damage parameterωis a function of a monotonically increasing history parameterκ,ω=ω(κ). In order to ensure thatκcan only grow, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker  [24,25] conditions(11)f≤0,κ̇≥0,κ̇f=0need to be satisfied. Monotonicity ofκinvolves monotonicity ofω.Herein, the loading functionf=η̄−κis used, withη̄the non-local equivalent strain. The latter quantity is defined as the volume average of the local equivalent strainη(12)η̄(x¯)=∫Ωg(x¯,x¯̃)η(x¯̃)dx¯̃∫Ωg(x¯,x¯̃)dx¯̃withg(x¯,x¯̃)=exp(−‖x¯−x¯̃‖2lc2)the weighting function andlcthe length scale parameter. Expressing the local equivalent strainη(x¯̃)in a Taylor series aroundx¯̃=x¯and since pointx¯takes all values inx¯̃, i.e.x¯andx¯̃are equivalent, we obtain(13)η̄(x¯)=η(x¯)+lc22η,ii(x¯)+lc48η,iijj(x¯)+….We differentiate Eq. (13) twice and multiply bylc22, and subsequently differentiate Eq. (13) four times and multiply bylc28. The resulting identities are combined with Eq. (13) to give:(14)η̄−lc22η̄,ii+lc48η̄,iijj=η+lc864η,iijjkkll+….Neglecting higher order terms in Eq. (14) results in a fourth order partial differential equation for the non-local equivalent strainη̄(15)η̄−lc22η̄,ii+lc48η̄,iijj=η,which must be solved in conjunction with Eq. (7). The boundary conditions(16)η̄,ini=0,η̄,ijni=0,η̄,ijjni=0are imposed since it was observed in  [19] that ignoring the boundary terms has a minor effect. Multiplying Eq. (7) by a test functionδuj, Eq. (15) by a test functionδη̄, integrating over the domainΩ, exploiting integration by parts, Gauss’ theorem and the boundary conditions in Eqs. (8) and (16) finally results in:(17)∫Ωδui,jσijdV=∫∂ΩhδuihidA,∫Ωδη̄η̄+lc22δη̄,iη̄,i+lc48δη̄,ijη̄,ijdV=∫Ωδη̄ηdV.Discretisation of the domainΩintoEelements,(18)Ω=⋃e=1EΩe,and approximation of the displacementui, the non-local strainη̄and their derivatives,(19)u¯e=N¯¯uu¯,δu¯e=N¯¯uδu¯,ε¯e=B¯¯uu¯,δε¯e=B¯¯uδu¯,η̄e=N¯η̄Tη¯̄,δη̄e=N¯η̄Tδη¯̄,η¯̄,ie=B¯¯η̄η¯̄,δη¯̄,ie=B¯¯η̄δη¯̄,η¯̄,ije=B¯¯η̄η̄η¯̄,δη¯̄,ije=B¯¯η̄η̄δη¯̄,with(20)u¯e=[u1eu2e],δu¯e=[δu1eδu2e],ε¯e=[ε11eε22e2ε12e],δε¯e=[δε11eδε22e2δε12e],η¯̄,ie=[η̄,1eη̄,2e],δη¯̄,ie=[δη̄,1eδη̄,2e],η¯̄,ije=[η̄,11eη̄,22e2η̄,12e],δη¯̄,ije=[δη̄,11eδη̄,22e2δη̄,12e],N¯¯u=[N10N20…0N10N2…],B¯¯u=[N1,10N2,10…0N1,20N2,2…N1,2N1,1N2,2N2,1…],N¯η̄T=[N1N2…],B¯¯η̄=[N1,1N2,1…N1,2N2,2…],B¯¯η̄η̄=[N1,11N2,11…N1,22N2,22…2N1,122N2,12…]gives the following matrix–vector equation for Eq.

In the remainder we employ the arc-length function based on the rates of internalU̇and dissipated energyĖDfrom  [26]. Linearisation of Eq. (22) yields for thei+1th iteration in then+1th increment:(23)[u¯η¯̄λ]i+1n+1=[u¯η¯̄λ]in+1−K¯¯T−1|in+1⋅[f¯uint(u¯,η¯̄)−λf¯ˆf¯η̄int(u¯,η¯̄)ψ(u¯,λ)]in+1,with the tangential stiffness matrix(24)K¯¯T(u¯,η¯̄,λ)=[∂f¯uint(u¯,η¯̄)∂u¯∂f¯uint(u¯,η¯̄)∂η¯̄−f¯ˆ∂f¯η̄int(u¯,η¯̄)∂u¯∂f¯η̄int(u¯,η¯̄)∂η¯̄0∂ψ(u¯,λ)∂u¯0T∂ψ(u¯,λ)∂λ].In this section, we first study the L-shaped specimen considered before in  [19]. Next, a Single-Edge Notched Beam (SENB) is considered subject to an antisymmetric four-point shear loading.The set-up for the L-shaped specimen is given in Fig. 4and the parameters and coefficients have been chosen according to  [19].The L-shaped specimen has been discretised using NURBS, T-splines and Powell–Sabin B-splines. AC1-continuous NURBS mesh is depicted in  Fig. 5. This mesh contains two pairs of overlapping control points which results in a vanishing determinant of the Jacobian matrixJij=∂xi∂ξj. It has been shown in  [27] that these discretisations can still be robust. However, when several NURBS-patches are used, they join withC0-continuity only. RegainingC1-continuity, especially when three or more than four NURBS-patches join at an extraordinary point, is cumbersome.A mesh that isC1-continuous throughout the L-shaped domain is shown in Fig. 6for T-splines. According to  [28], this T-spline mesh is standard, i.e. all blending functions sum to one. Furthermore, the Bézier extraction operator is a square matrix in each element. It is noted that the blue marked corner in  Fig. 6(b) is not interpolatory, i.e. there is no control point. If, instead, the L-shaped specimen is modelled with an interpolatory cornerC0-continuity is introduced. The mesh in Fig. 6 has the disadvantage that it needs to be created by hand.Alternatively, Fig. 1 shows the Powell–Sabin B-spline mesh that is obtained directly from a standard triangulation. The linear constraints along the platens in Fig. 4 are imposed using a master–slave relation as follows (see also Fig. 7for the bottom platen). Letu¯Aandu¯Bbe the displacement at the left and right corners of the bottom platen with coordinatesxAandxB, respectively. A and B are the master control points. Then, for any slave control point S with coordinatesxSalong the edge, its displacementu¯Sis set to(25)u¯S=(1−xS−xAxB−xA)u¯A+xS−xAxB−xAu¯B.This master–slave relation must be incorporated into Eq. (23) as described in  [29]. Note, that Eq. (25) follows from the intercept theorem(26)u¯S−u¯AxS−xA=u¯B−u¯AxB−xA.In the calculations, the following parameters have been used: Young’s modulusE=10,000MPa, Poisson’s ratioν=0.2and an internal length scale parameterlc=52mm2. Plane-stress conditions are assumed. The thickness of the specimen ist=200mm. The modified von Mises local equivalent strain defined in  [30](27)η(ε)=k−12k(1−2ν)I1(ε)+12k(k−11−2νI1(ε))2+12k(1+ν)2J2(ε),with the first invariant of the strain tensor,(28)I1(ε)=εkk,and the second invariant of the deviatoric strain tensor,(29)J2(ε)=12εijεij−16I1(ε)2,has been used. In Eq. (27),k=10is set in order to account for different strengths in compression and tension. The following damage law  [31] has been utilised(30)ω(κ)={0κ≤κ01−κ0κ(1−α+αexp(β(κ0−κ)))κ>κ0,with the parametersκ0=4×10−4,α=0.98andβ=80.Displacement control has been applied to the left corner of the bottom platen and the bottom corner of the left platen with an increment ofΔū=0.05mm. The meshes for the Powell–Sabin B-splines have been refined uniformly.Fig. 8shows the force–displacement curves for four different mesh sizes. The legend entry displays the number of degrees of freedom (DOF). Fig. 9shows the contours for the damage fieldωand the first principal stressσ1for the mesh with 20,322 degrees of freedom at a displacementū=1.9mm. Finally, Fig. 10shows a comparison in terms of the force–displacement curve between the second order and the fourth order gradient damage formulations (for the mesh with 20,322 degrees of freedom).The second example concerns a Single-Edge Notched Beam (SENB). The parameters and coefficients have been taken from  [32]. The geometry and the boundary conditions are depicted in Fig. 11.The two platens at the top and at the bottom have not been modelled explicitly in the finite element model. Instead, they are incorporated by means of linear constraints with a master–slave dependency as in the previous example. For the platen at the top (Fig. 12(a)), the displacement of the orange control points (circles) is set to zero. The master control point C is marked blue. The displacement of the slave control points (green) is set to(31)u¯S=(1−xS−xCxD−xC)u¯C.It is noted that at the vertex D (which is not a control point) the displacement is zero.At the bottom platen (cf.  Fig. 12(b)),fˆkj=αkjhas been imposed for the two orange control points (circles). The orange control points correspond to the vertex G marked with an orange square. Since one edge of the Powell–Sabin triangle for vertex G lies on the boundary, we haveαkj=0for the third control point. With Eq. (3)a, we get the required prescribed load for the bottom platen. Furthermore, the relation(32)u¯S=(1−xS−xExF−xE)u¯E+xS−xExF−xEu¯Fhas been incorporated into Eq. (23), where S are the slave control points (green) and E and F are the master control points (blue). For the fixed boundary condition at the top right, the displacement in the vertical direction of the two control points (marked orange) in Fig. 13(a) is set to zero. The boundary condition at the bottom left is imposed by settingfˆkj=αkjfor the two control points (orange) in Fig. 13(b).The material parameters of the concrete are: Young’s modulusE=35,000MPa, Poisson’s ratioν=0.2with a plane-stress assumption. The thickness of the specimen ist=100mm. The internal length scale is set tolc=2mm2. The modified von Mises local equivalent strain, Eq. (27), and the damage law Eq. (30) have been used again, but now withk=10,κ0=6×10−5,α=0.96andβ=100. In order to trace the equilibrium path, the arc-length method proposed in  [26] has been employed withΔτ=8kNanda=0.25. The meshes have been refined uniformly.Fig. 14shows the force–displacement curves. Along thex-axis the crack mouth sliding displacement (CMSD, the difference in the vertical displacement between the right and the left notch tips) has been plotted, and along they-axis the forceP=1110λ.Fig. 15(a) shows for the Single-Edge Notched Beam with 74,448 degrees of freedom at aCMSD=0.04mmthe damage and stress fieldωandσxx, respectively. It is noted that for coarser meshes (less than 19,044 degrees of freedom), the Single-Edge Notched Beam may fail due to the damage zone which starts to grow at the bottom left edge while the damage zone at the notch does not propagate. Hence, fine meshes are required in order to obtain results that are in agreement with the experiments in  [33].This section introduces a discrete approach to fracture where a cohesive zone model is used for the tractions between the faces of the crack. The re-meshing procedure is explained, and as an example the Single-Edge Notched Beam is considered again.For the cohesive zone modelling, a discontinuityΓdis present within the domainΩ. It consists of two overlapping boundaries,Γd+andΓd−see Fig. 16(b). Along each boundaryΓd+andΓd−we impose(33)σijnj+=ti+onΓd+,σijnj−=ti−onΓd−.t+andt−are the tractions in the cohesive zone on the positive and negative side, respectively.n+andn−are the normal vectors onΓd+andΓd−. Setting(34)ti=ti−=σijnj−results in(35)ti+=σijnj+=−σijnj−=−ti.For the intact bulk material the stress tensorσin Eq. (7) is assumed to be linearly related to the (infinitesimal) strain tensorε:(36)σij=Cijklεkl.Multiplying Eq. (7) by a test functionδujand integrating over the domainΩyields(37)∫Ωδui,jσijdV+∫Γd+δui+tidA−∫Γd−δui−tidA=∫∂ΩhδuihidAafter integration by parts, use of Gauss’ theorem and application of the boundary conditions, Eqs.  (8)–(35). Since∫Γd+…dA=∫Γd−…dA=∫Γd…dA, Eq. (37) can be replaced by(38)∫Ωδui,jσijdV+∫Γdδ〚ui〛tidA=∫∂ΩhδuihidAwith〚ui〛=ui+−ui−the crack opening.Discretisation of the domainΩintoEelements,(39)Ω=⋃e=1EΩe,and approximation of the displacements and their derivatives,(40)u¯e=N¯¯uu¯,δu¯e=N¯¯uδu¯,ε¯e=B¯¯uu¯,δε¯e=B¯¯uδu¯,with(41)u¯e=[u1eu2e],δu¯e=[δu1eδu2e],ε¯e=[ε11eε22e2ε12e],δε¯e=[δε11eδε22e2δε12e],N¯¯u=[N10N20…0N10N2…],B¯¯u=[N1,10N2,10…0N1,20N2,2…N1,2N1,1N2,2N2,1…]results in the following matrix–vector equation:(42)δu¯T(∫ΩB¯¯uTC¯¯B¯¯udVu¯+∫Γd(N¯¯u+T−N¯¯u−T)t¯dA)︸f¯uint(u¯)−δu¯T∫∂ΩhN¯¯uTh¯dA︸f¯uext=0.The tractiont¯in the global coordinate system can be obtained from the local tractiont¯dvia the transformation(43)t¯=Q¯¯Tt¯d,withQ¯¯the orthogonal rotation matrix,(44)Q¯¯=Q¯¯−=[+nx−ny−−ny−nx−],andn¯−the normal vector from the minus side of the internal discontinuity,Γd−, Fig. 16(b).t¯dis a function of the crack opening〚u¯d〛in the local coordinate system of the discontinuityΓd,t¯d=t¯d(〚u¯d〛). The local jump〚u¯d〛can be evaluated from(45)〚u¯d〛=Q¯¯〚u¯〛.The vectors for the local tractiont¯dand local jump〚u¯d〛consist of a normal and shear component(46)t¯d=[tnts],〚u¯d〛=[〚un〛〚us〛].It is emphasised that the Bézier ordinates of the Bézier extraction operator in Eq. (5) that are required to computeN¯¯u+andN¯¯u−in Eq. (42) are different on both sides of the internal discontinuityΓd. This stems from the fact that pairs of Powell–Sabin triangles on either side ofΓdare in general not symmetric, Fig. 17.Since Eq. (42) must hold for anyδu¯, the following discrete system results withh¯=0¯:(47)H¯(u¯,λ)=[f¯uint(u¯)−λf¯ˆψ(u¯,λ)]=0¯,where, again,λis the loading parameter,f¯ˆthe normalised load vector andψan arc-length function. Linearisation of Eq. (47) yields the solution for thei+1th iteration in then+1th increment:(48)[u¯λ]i+1n+1=[u¯λ]in+1−K¯¯T−1|in+1⋅[f¯uint(u¯)−λf¯ˆψ(u¯,λ)]in+1,with(49)K¯¯T(u¯,λ)=[∂f¯uint(u¯)∂u¯−f¯ˆ∂ψ(u¯)∂u¯∂ψ(u¯,λ)∂λ]the tangential stiffness matrix.Different from Section  3, a dissipation-based arc-length method forψis not used. Since the crack length does not increase in each increment, new interfaces are not inserted in each increment. Therefore, the amount of energy that can be dissipated is different depending on whether a new cohesive element has been added or not, which makes the use of an energy-based constraint less obvious. Instead, an arc-length method has been employed which controls the crack mouth sliding displacement (CMSD)  [34], although the present formulation is slightly different. Herein, the constraint(50)unR−unL=nΔūCMSDis enforced, whereunRis the displacement on the right andunLis the displacement on the left tip of the notch (Fig. 11) in thenth increment, andΔūCMSDthe prescribed CMSD. In then+1th increment,(51)un+1R−un+1L=(n+1)ΔūCMSDmust be fulfilled. Subtracting Eq. (50) from Eq. (51) results in(52)un+1R−unR−(un+1L−unL)=(n+1−n)ΔūCMSD,(53)ΔuR−ΔuL=ΔūCMSD,so that the following arc-length method constraint applies in each increment(54)ψ(u¯)=ΔuR−ΔuL−ΔūCMSD.Sinceψdepends only on the displacement vectoru¯in Eq. (54), the term∂ψ(u¯,λ)∂λbecomes zero in Eq. (49). This would result in a singular tangential stiffness matrixK¯¯T. Therefore, Eq. (48) cannot be used to solve our problem. However, the linearised form of Eq. (47) can be solved foru¯i+1n+1andλi+1n+1in a staggered manner  [35]. At first, we solve for(55)δu¯i+1n+1I=(∂f¯uint(u¯)∂u¯|in+1)−1⋅f¯ˆ,(56)δu¯i+1n+1II=(∂f¯uint(u¯)∂u¯|in+1)−1⋅(λin+1f¯ˆ−f¯uint(u¯in+1))and use these to compute(57)δλi+1n+1=−ψ−∂ψ∂u¯δu¯i+1n+1II∂ψ∂u¯δu¯i+1n+1I+∂ψ∂λ,(58)δu¯i+1n+1=δλi+1n+1δu¯i+1n+1I+δu¯i+1n+1II.Finally, we obtain(59)u¯i+1n+1=u¯in+1+δu¯i+1n+1,(60)λi+1n+1=λin+1+δλi+1n+1.After obtaining an equilibrium in incrementn+1for Eq. (47), the first principal stress at the crack tip (black vertex in Fig. 18) is evaluated. Benefiting from theC1-continuity, it can be directly computed at the vertex. When the first principal stress exceeds the critical stresstult, the vector normal to the first principal stress direction is computed. The location, where this vector intersects an element edge is highlighted red in Fig. 18. This marks the location of the new crack tip. As a next step, elements in the neighbourhood of the new crack tip have to be re-meshed while the position of the vertices along the crack path and the new crack tip are held fixed. For instance, vertices on and outside the blue polygon and the new crack tip in Fig. 18 are not allowed to move and re-meshing is applied within the blue polygon. For local re-meshing, the approach from  [36] is used which interprets the mesh as a truss structure and finds an equilibrium such that forces at the vertices are zero.After re-meshing, we have to determine locally the new Powell–Sabin triangles and solve again Eq. (47) for incrementn+1with the extended crack. When solving Eq. (47) for incrementn+1, the displacement vectoru¯̃nfor incrementnon the updated mesh is required. In order to find the displacement vectoru¯̃n, the following problem is solved locally for the re-meshed domain(61)min(12∫Ω‖N¯¯̃uu¯̃n−N¯¯uu¯n‖22dV),whereN¯¯̃ucontains the basis functions on the updated mesh. Eq. (61) results in the system(62)∫ΩN¯¯̃uTN¯¯̃uu¯̃ndV=∫ΩN¯¯̃uN¯¯uu¯ndV,which can be solved directly foru¯̃n.As an example, the Single-Edge Notched Beam is re-considered. The parameters and coefficients have been taken from  [10]. The material parameters are: Young’s modulusE=35,000MPaand Poisson’s ratioν=0.2with a plane-stress assumption. The concrete is modelled linearly elastic. The thickness of the beam ist=100mmand the value of the critical stress is set totult=2.8MPa. For the local tractiont¯d, the relations from  [5] are used. The cohesive law in the normal direction reads(63)tn=tultexp(−tultGcκ),see Fig. 19, where the history parameterκis determined by the loading functionf=〚un〛−κwhich evolves according to the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions of Eq. (11). The fracture energy and the penetration stiffness are taken asGc=0.1N/mmandkp=104N/mm3, respectively.In the shear direction,(64)ts=dint〚us〛has been used with an initial shear stiffnessdint=1MPa/mm. At the onset of the simulation,ΔūCMSD=1.5×10−3mmhas been taken. Fig. 20shows the resulting force–displacement curves for six different mesh sizes. The mesh is refined uniformly. Along thex-axis, the CMSD is plotted, while they-axis gives the reaction forceP=1110λ. The legend entry displays the number of degrees of freedom at the beginning and at the end of the simulation. Fig. 21shows the final crack paths for six different discretisations. Fig. 22gives the stress fieldσxxatCMSD=0.04mmfor the mesh with 49632–49860 degrees of freedom. This mesh size is equivalent to that using the implicit fourth-order gradient damage model with 74,448 degrees of freedom, Fig. 15. Finally, Fig. 23gives an overlap of the initial and final mesh with 744 and 768 degrees of freedom, respectively.The discrete approach with cohesive zones along the crack path requires less degrees of freedom than the implicit fourth order gradient damage model for numerical results that are in good agreement with the experiments carried out in  [33]. Also, since derivatives of second order are required for the implicit fourth order gradient damage model, the computation of the tangential stiffness matrix and force vector is more expensive. Nevertheless, implementation is easier for the implicit fourth order gradient damage model since no re-meshing is necessary.Structured T-splines have been used for cohesive zone modelling for the Single-Edge Notched Beam in  [10]. Fig. 24(a) shows the initial T-spline mesh. In order to determine the position of the control points, an elliptic problem is solved in the parameter domain, while the location of some control points has to be prescribed, for instance control points on the boundary. It is observed from Fig. 24 that not only the position of control points on the boundary, but also the position of the blue control points in the interior has to be prescribed. Furthermore, the blue control points have to be positioned such that the initial mesh has to be aligned with the final crack path (red). Only then, elements can be split vertically. If the location of the blue control points were not prescribed, the mesh in Fig. 24(b) would be obtained after solving the elliptic problem in the parameter domain. This would result in inverted elements around the notch. Since the final crack path is not always known a priori, the capabilities of structured T-splines to model discrete fracture therefore seem somewhat limited. Furthermore, the degree of continuity across elements sharing one edge that touches the crack tip is onlyC0, so that stresses need to be evaluated and weighted at the integration points in the vicinity of the crack tip in order to determine when the critical stresstultis reached, which detracts from the usual gain in terms of accuracy of splines compared to Lagrangian basis functions.Powell–Sabin B-splines can be an appealing alternative to NURBS or T-splines when applied to damage and fracture.C1-continuous Powell–Sabin B-splines can be obtained from any triangulation and Bézier extraction allows an efficient computation. TheC1-continuity of Powell–Sabin B-splines makes them suitable candidates not only for the implicit fourth-order gradient damage model, but also for discrete fracture simulations, since they remainC1-continuous at the crack tip. This property allows for a direct evaluation of stresses at the crack tip. Furthermore, re-meshing Powell–Sabin B-splines is always possible and the initial mesh does not have to be aligned with the final crack path as for structured T-splines.A disadvantage of Powell–Sabin splines is that there is at present no procedure for obtaining Powell–Sabin B-splines on arbitrary tetrahedral meshes in three dimensions since certain constraints with neighbouring tetrahedrons have to be fulfilled  [37]. Hence, three-dimensional Powell–Sabin B-splines currently work only for structured meshes. Indeed, a “perfect” solution forC1-continuous tetrahedra does not (yet) seem to exist  [38].
