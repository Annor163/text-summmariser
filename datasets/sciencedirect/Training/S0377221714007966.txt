@&#ABSTRACT@&#
ELECTRE TRI is a set of methods designed to sort alternatives evaluated on several criteria into ordered categories. The original method uses limiting profiles. A recently introduced method uses central profiles. We study the relations between these two methods. We do so by investigating if an ordered partition obtained with one method can also be obtained with the other method, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. We also investigate a number of situations in which the original method using limiting profiles gives results that do not fit well our intuition. This leads us to propose a variant of ELECTRE TRI that uses limiting profiles. We show that this variant may have some advantages over the original method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
This paper deals with ELECTRE TRI. It consists in a set of methods that are the most recent ones belonging to the ELECTRE family of methods (for overviews,see Figueira et al., 2005, Figueira et al., 2013, Roy and Bouyssou, 1993, chap. 5 and 6).ELECTRE TRI was originally introduced in the doctoral dissertation of Wei (1992) (supervised by B. Roy) and was detailed in Roy and Bouyssou (1993, pp. 389–401). The original method is designed to sort alternatives evaluated on multiple criteria into ordered categories defined by limiting profiles (see Roy and Bouyssou, 1993, chap. 6, for a detailed analysis of the sorting problem formulation). This method has generated much interest. Indeed, sorting alternatives into ordered categories is a problem occurring in many real-world situations. Moreover, on a more technical level, the fact that the method only compares alternatives with a set of carefully selected limiting profiles that are linked by dominance greatly facilitates the exploitation of the outranking relation that is built. This limits the consequences of the fact that this relation is, in general, neither transitive nor complete (Bouyssou, 1996). Many techniques have been proposed for the elicitation of the parameters of this method (see Cailloux et al., 2012; Dias and Clímaco, 2000; Dias et al., 2002; Dias and Mousseau, 2003; 2006; Damart et al., 2007; Leroy et al., 2011; Mousseau and Słowiński, 1998; Mousseau et al., 2000; 2001; 2003; Mousseau and Dias, 2004; Mousseau et al., 2006; Ngo The and Mousseau, 2002; Zheng et al., 2014). Most of them use mathematical programming tools to infer the parameters of the method, based on assignment examples. This method has been applied to a large variety of real world problems (see the references at the end of Section 6 in Almeida-Dias et al., 2010). It has received a fairly complete axiomatic analysis in Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a); 2007b). In a nutshell, ELECTRE TRI can be considered as a real success story within the ELECTRE family of methods.A recent paper (Almeida-Dias et al., 2010) introduced a new method that uses central profiles instead of limiting profiles (Almeida-Dias et al., 2010, use the term “characteristic reference action” instead of central profiles). This is an interesting development since it seems “intuitively” easier to elicit central rather than limiting profiles (a related paper, Almeida-Dias et al., 2012, deals with the case of multiple central profiles. We do not study this more general case in the present paper).The present paper was prompted by the analysis of this new method and its comparison with the original one. After having recalled the essential elements of both methods (Section 2), we investigate two main points.We first study the relations between these two methods (Section 3). We do so by investigating if an ordered partition obtained with one method can also be obtained with the other method, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. Our main conclusion is that this is not always possible. This fact should not be interpreted as a criticism of ELECTRE TRI but as the sign that the two methods that we study use, beyond surface, different principles.We then present (Section 4) a number of situations in which the original method using limiting profiles gives results that do not fit well our intuition. These situations are mainly linked to the behavior of the method w.r.t. what we will call “strong dominance” and w.r.t. the transposition operation used by Almeida-Dias et al. (2010) to justify their proposal of two components of the method using central profiles that they recommend using conjointly. In particular, as first observed in Roy (2002), the two versions of the original method do not correspond via the application of this transposition operation: the pseudo-disjunctive version (also known as “optimistic”) is not obtained from the pseudo-conjunctive version (also known as “pessimistic”) via the transposition operation and vice versa. We detail this point that may explain why most of the elicitation techniques proposed so far only deal with the pseudo-conjunctive version (Zheng, 2012; Zheng et al., 2014, are exceptions) and why the axiomatic analysis conducted in Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a); 2007b) is also limited to the pseudo-conjunctive version. This will lead us to propose a new variant of ELECTRE TRI using limiting profiles in which the two versions correspond via the transposition operation. We show that this new variant may have some advantages over the original method. A final section (Section 5) concludes with the indication of directions for future research.33In what follows, we will use the following terminology. ELECTRE TRI is a set of methods. ELECTRE TRI-B is a method that has two versions: ELECTRE TRI-B, pseudo-conjunctive, and ELECTRE TRI-B, pseudo-disjunctive. ELECTRE TRI-C is a method that has two components: ELECTRE TRI-C, ascending, and ELECTRE TRI-C, descending. We sometimes abbreviate ELECTRE TRI-B, ELECTRE TRI-B, pseudo-conjunctive, and ELECTRE TRI-B, pseudo-disjunctive as ETRI-B, ETRI-B-pc, and ETRI-B-pd. We also sometimes abbreviate ELECTRE TRI-C, ELECTRE TRI-C, ascending, and ELECTRE TRI-C, descending as ETRI-C, ETRI-C-a, and ETRI-C-d.We consider a set of alternatives A. Each alternative a ∈ A is supposed to be evaluated on a family of n real-valued criteria, i.e., n functions g1, g2, …, gnfrom A intoR. These criteria are built with respect to a propertyP. This property is usually taken to be “preference” but it can also be “riskiness” or “flexibility”. Let us define N = {1, 2, …, n}. We suppose, w.l.o.g., that increasing the performance on any criterion increases the performance of an alternative w.r.t. the propertyP. The dominance relationΔis defined letting, for all a, b ∈ A,aΔbif gi(a) ≥ gi(b), for all i ∈ N. In such a case, we say that adominates b. We say that a strictly dominates b ifaΔbandNot[bΔa],which we denote byaΔab,sinceΔais the asymmetric part ofΔ.In all the examples that follow, discordance will play no role and, on all criteria, the indifference and preference thresholds will be equal (hence, it is not restrictive to take them constant, see Roy and Vincke, 1987). In order to keep things simple, we briefly recall here how the outranking relation is built in this particular case. We refer, e.g.,to Almeida-Dias et al. (2010, Section 2) or to Roy and Bouyssou (1993, pp. 284–289) for the description of the construction of the outranking relation in the general case, i.e.,when indifference and preference thresholds may be unequal and may vary and when discordance plays a role. It is important to realize the definition of the outranking relation that we detail below, although simpler than the general definition, is a particular case of the general one. All relations that can be obtained using the formulae in this section can be obtained using the more general formulae presented in Almeida-Dias et al. (2010, Section 2) and Roy and Bouyssou (1993, pp. 284–289).We associate with each criterion i ∈ N a nonnegative preference threshold pi≥ 0. If the value gi(a) − gi(b) is positive but less than pi, it is supposed that this difference is not significant, given the way gihas been built. Hence, on this criterion, the two alternatives should be considered indifferent.The above information is used to define, on each criterion i ∈ N, a valued relation on A, i.e.,a function from A × A into [0, 1], called the partial concordance relation, such that:ci(a,b)={1ifgi(b)−gi(a)≤pi,0ifgi(b)−gi(a)>pi,(in the particular case studied here, the valued relations cican only take the values 0 or 1. In the general case, they can take any value between 0 and 1).Each criterion i ∈ N is assigned a non-negative weight wi. We suppose, w.l.o.g., that weights have been normalized so that∑i=1nwi=1.The valued relations ciare aggregated into a single valued outranking relation s letting, for all a, b ∈ A,s(a,b)=∑i=1nwici(a,b).On the basis of the valued relation s, a binary relation Sλon A is defined letting:aSλb⇔s(a,b)≥λ,where λ ∈ [0, 1] is a cutting level (usually taken to be above 1/2). The relation Sλis interpreted as saying “has at least as much of propertyPas” relation between alternatives (if, as is usually assumed, propertyPis taken to be “preference”, the relation Sλis classically interpreted as an “at least as good as” relation between alternatives). From Sλ, we derive the following relations:aPλb⇔[aSλbandNot[bSλa]],aIλb⇔[aSλbandbSλa],aJλb⇔[Not[aSλb]andNot[bSλa]],that are respectively interpreted as “has strictly more of propertyPas”, “has as much of propertyPas”, “is not comparable w.r.t. propertyPto” relations between alternatives (if propertyPis taken to be “preference”, these relations are respectively interpreted as: “strictly better than”, “indifferent to” and “incomparable to”).It is easy to check (Roy and Bouyssou, 1993, chap. 5) that, ifaΔb,then s(a, b) = 1 and, for all c ∈ A, s(b, c) ≤ s(a, c) and s(c, a) ≤ s(c, b). Hence, ifaΔb,we have aSλb and, for all c ∈ A,bSλc⇒aSλc,bPλc⇒aPλc,cSλa⇒cSλb,cPλa⇒cPλb.The following proposition will be useful. It is taken from Roy and Bouyssou (1993, chap. 6, pp. 392–393) and its validity is independent of the simplifying hypotheses we have made concerning the construction of the outranking relation.Proposition 1Let c1, c2, …, ct∈ A be such thatck+1Δackfor k = 1, 2, …, t − 1. Suppose furthermore that, for all a ∈ A∖{c1, ct}, ctPλa and aPλc1.When an alternative a ∈ A∖{c1, ct} is compared to the subset of alternatives c1, c2, …, ct, three distinct situations may arise:1.ctPλa,…,ck1+1Pλa,aPλck1,aPλck1−1,…,aPλc1,ctPλa,…,cℓ2+1Pλa,aIλcℓ2,aIλcℓ2−1,…,aIλck2+1,aPλck2,…,aPλc1,ctPλa,…,cℓ3+1Pλa,aJλcℓ3,aJλcℓ3−1,…,aJλck3+1,aPλck3,…,aPλc1,with t > k1 > 0, t > ℓ2 > k2 > 0, and t > ℓ3 > k3 > 0.The proof of the above proposition is quite easy (see Roy and Bouyssou, 1993, pp. 392–393) and rests on the fact that the alternatives ckare linked by strict dominance and that the outranking relation is compatible with dominance.The first method, called ELECTRE TRI in Roy and Bouyssou (1993, chap. 6), uses limiting profiles. It was renamed ELECTRE TRI-B (ETRI-B, for short) by Almeida-Dias et al. (2010). We follow their naming conventions. ETRI-B has two versions called “pessimistic” and “optimistic” in Roy and Bouyssou (1993). Roy (2002) suggested, in view of the fact that propertyPmay be something else than “preference”, to rename the pessimistic version of the ELECTRE TRI-B as “pseudo-conjunctive” (ETRI-B-pc, for short) and the optimistic version as “pseudo-disjunctive” (ETRI-B-pc, for short). This convention was followed in Almeida-Dias et al. (2010) and we do the same here.We consider the case of r ordered categories C1, C2, …, Cr, with Crcontaining the alternatives having the more of propertyP. The category Ckis modeled using limiting profiles. The lower limiting profile of Ckis πk. The upper limiting profile of Ckis πk + 1. Notice that the lower limiting profile πkof Ckis also the upper limiting profile of Ck − 1. Similarly, the upper limiting profile πk + 1 of Ckis also the lower limiting profile of Ck + 1 (see Fig. 1).We suppose that the limiting profiles are such that πk + 1 strictly dominates πk. The profile π1 (resp.πr + 1) is taken to be arbitrarily low (resp.high). It will be convenient to suppose that πk∈ A, for k = 2, 3, …, r, while π1, πr + 1∉A. With this convention, we have, for all a ∈ A, aPλπ1 and πr + 1Pλa.The two versions of ETRI-B are defined as follows (Roy and Bouyssou, 1993, pp. 390–391).Definition 1ETRI-B-pcDecrease k from r + 1 until the first value k such that aSλπk. Assign alternative a to Ck.Increase k from 1 until the first value k such that πkPλa. Assign alternative a to Ck − 1.Take any a ∈ A. We know that aPλπ1 and πr + 1Pλa. This implies that it is not true that aSλπr + 1 but that aSλπ1 holds. This shows that, with ETRI-B-pc, each alternative a ∈ A is assigned to one of the categories C1, C2, …, Cr.Similarly, we know that πr + 1Pλa while we do not have π1Pλa. This shows that, with ETRI-B-pd, each alternative a ∈ A is assigned to one of the categories C1, C2, …, Cr.Roy and Bouyssou (1993, chap. 6, pp. 393–395) have shown that if a ∈ A is assigned to category Ckby ETRI-B-pc and to category Cℓ by ETRI-B-pd, then k ≤ ℓ. This explains why ETRI-B-pc (resp. ETRI-B-pd) was initially called pessimistic (resp. optimistic), with propertyPinterpreted as “preference”. Indeed, because of the definition of the profiles, we may apply Proposition 1 when comparing an alternative to the set of profiles π1, π2, …, πr + 1. It is easy to check that the two versions of ETRI-B lead to identical results in the first (resp.second) case: a is assigned toCk1(resp.Cℓ2), where k1 (resp.ℓ2) is the highest index such thataSλπk1(resp.aSλπℓ2). In the third case (i.e.,whenπr+1Pλa,…,πℓ3+1Pλa,aJλπℓ3,…,aJλπk3+1,aPλπk3,…,aPλπ1), ETRI-B-pc assigns a toCk3while ETRI-B-pd assigns it toCℓ3.Definitions 1 and 2 are the ones found in Roy and Bouyssou (1993, pp. 390–391). They require that categories are labeled in a way that is consistent with the orientation given by the propertyP,the category Cr(resp. C1) containing the alternatives having the more (resp. the less) of propertyP. These definitions are not well adapted to study the effect of the transposition operation, defined later. It will be useful to keep in mind the following equivalent definitions.ETRI-B-pc assigns an alternative a to the unique category Cksuch that a is at least as good as to the lower limiting profile of this category and is not at least as good as its upper limiting profile (the relation “at least as good as” being Sλ).ETRI-B-pd assigns an alternative a to the unique category Cksuch that the upper limiting profile of this category is better than a and the lower limiting profile of this category is not better than a (the relation “better than” being Pλ).We still consider the case of r ordered categories C1, C2, …, Cr, with Crcontaining the alternative having the more of propertyP. The category Ckis modeled using a central profile ωk(see Fig. 2).We suppose that the central profiles are such that ωk + 1 strictly dominates ωk. Moreover, we adjoin to ω1, ω2, …, ωrtwo fictitious profiles ω0 and ωr + 1. The profile ω0 (resp. ωr + 1) is taken to be arbitrarily low (resp. high). It will be convenient to suppose that ωk∈ A, for k = 1, 2, …, r, while ω0, ωr + 1∉A. With this convention, we have, for all a ∈ A, aPλω1 and ωr + 1Pλa.For all a, b ∈ A, let ρ(a, b) = min (s(a, b), s(b, a)), ρ being called the selecting function in Almeida-Dias et al. (2010).We define below the two components of ELECTRE TRI-C (ETRI-C, for short), called ELECTRE TRI-C, ascending (ETRI-C-a, for short) and ELECTRE TRI-C, descending (ETRI-C-d, for short), as introduced in Almeida-Dias et al. (2010). Almeida-Dias et al. (2010) recommend using these two components conjointly. This explains our choice of the term “component”, instead of the term “version” that was used for ETRI-B.Definition 3ETRI-C-dDecrease k from r + 1 until the first value k such that s(a, ωk) ≥ λ,a)for k = r, assign a to Cr,for 1 ≤ k ≤ r − 1, assign a to Ckif ρ(a, ωk) > ρ(a, ωk + 1), otherwise assign a to Ck + 1,for k = 0, assign a to C1.Increase k from 0 until the first value k such that s(ωk, a) ≥ λ,a)for k = 1, assign a to C1,for 2 ≤ k ≤ r, assign a to Ckif ρ(a, ωk) > ρ(a, ωk − 1), otherwise assign a to Ck − 1,for k = r + 1, assign a to Cr.These two components are to be used conjointly. This means that, if a ∈ A is assigned to Cℓ by one component of the method and to Ckby the other one, the result of ETRI-C is that a is assigned to the interval of categories having Cℓ and Ckas extremities. This interval may, of course, be reduced to a single category when ℓ = k. Notice that, contrary to what is the case with ETRI-B, it is not true here that one component of the method always gives an assignment that is at least as high as the assignment given by the other component.Remark 4We know that aPλω0 and ωr + 1Pλa. It is impossible that s(a, ωr + 1) ≥ λ. Moreover, we have aSλω0. Hence, each alternative a ∈ A is assigned by ETRI-C-d to one of the categories C1, C2, …, Cr.Similarly, it is impossible that s(ω0, a) ≥ λ. We also know that ωr + 1Pλa. Hence, each alternative a ∈ A is assigned by ETRI-C-a to one of the categories C1, C2, …, Cr.We have seen that Almeida-Dias et al. (2010) introduced the method ELECTRE TRI-C that aims at sorting alternatives between ordered categories using, for each category, a profile that is supposed to be “central”, as opposed to the limiting profiles used in ELECTRE TRI-B (Roy and Bouyssou, 1993; Wei, 1992).Because we have a method using limiting profiles (ETRI-B) and a method using central profiles (ETRI-C), a very natural question arises. Suppose that a result has been obtained using ETRI-B with limiting profiles. Between two consecutive limiting profiles, is it possible to find a central profile so that using ETRI-C with this family of central profiles, we obtain a similar result? Of course, the converse question may also be raised. Suppose that a result has been obtained using ETRI-C with central profiles. Between two consecutive central profiles, is it possible to find a limiting profile so that using ETRI-B with this family of limiting profiles, we obtain a similar result? These questions are not answered in Almeida-Dias et al. (2010) (Figueira, 2013; Roy, 2013, reacting to a previous version of this text, indicate that this is because they felt that the two methods were really different. Almeida-Dias et al., 2010, Section 6, study what happens if one applies ETRI-B using the profiles defined for ETRI-C keeping everything else unchanged).ETRI-B has two versions. ETRI-C has two components. This leaves us with a total of eight questions to be answered. For instance, starting with an ordered partition obtained with ETRI-C-a is it always possible to modify the profiles, while keeping all other parameters unchanged (i.e., the preference and indifference thresholds, the weights, the cutting level, the ordering and number of categories), so that applying ETRI-B-pc to the same problem leads to the same ordered partition? (the reader might be perplexed by the fact that, in the statement of our problem, we have apparently ignored the recommendation of Almeida-Dias et al. (2010) to use the two components of ETRI-C conjointly. We have nevertheless taken care of this difficulty. In all the examples detailed below, the two components of ETRI-C will lead to the same result).It turns out that the answer to these eight questions is negative. As already mentioned, we do not view this fact as a criticism of ETRI-C and/or ETRI-B but as an indication that the relations between ETRI-C and ETRI-B are complex. Despite sharing a common name and apparently being closely related, ETRI-B and ETRI-C seem to rest on somewhat different principles.Because Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a); 2007b) have given necessary and sufficient conditions for an ordered partition to be obtained with ETRI-B-pc, when preference and indifference thresholds are equal, this case is the easiest one. This also shows the power of axiomatic analysis for studying methods. Since all the examples used below will involve only two categories, we use only results from Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a).Our aim is to establish the following proposition.Proposition 2There are ordered partitions that can be obtained with ETRI-C-a and that cannot be obtained with ETRI-B-pc, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. The same conclusion holds with ETRI-C-d instead of ETRI-C-a.The proof consists in exhibiting suitable examples. Our first example has six criteria and two categories. For all criteria, in order to simplify the presentation, the preference and indifference thresholds are both null. The weights are denoted by wi. We suppose that, on all criteria, the veto thresholds have been chosen so as to have no effect. We take λ = 0.6. H is the central profile of the High category (H) and L is the central profile of the Low category (L). The main parameters that are used are presented in Table 1. The evaluation of the alternatives that are to be sorted are given in Table 2. Applying ETRI-C to this example leads to the valued relation in Table 3.Given that λ = 0.6, we obtain with ETRI-C-d thata∈H,b∈H,c∈L,d∈L.Indeed, we have s(a, H) = 0.52 < λ = 0.6 and s(a, L) = 1.0 ≥ λ = 0.6. Alternative a will be assigned toHif ρ(a, H) = min (s(a, H), s(H, a)) > ρ(a, L) = min (s(a, L), s(L, a)). Using Table 3, we obtain ρ(a, H) = 0.52 > ρ(a, L) = 0.48. It is easy to check that the same results are obtained using ETRI-C-a. For instance, we have s(L, a) = 0.48 < λ = 0.6 and s(H, a) = 0.65 ≥ λ = 0.6. Alternative a will be assigned toHif ρ(a, H) = min (s(a, H), s(H, a)) > ρ(a, L) = min (s(a, L), s(L, a)). Using Table 3, we obtain ρ(a, H) = 0.52 > ρ(a, L) = 0.48.Using the analysis in Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a), it is now easy to see that these assignments cannot be obtained using ETRI-B-pc. Indeed, it is shown in these papers (see Bouyssou and Marchant, 2007a, Lemma 20 and Theorem 21, p. 230) that a necessary condition for assignments to be obtained with ETRI-B-pc, when the preference and indifference thresholds are equal and there is no veto involved, is that44The published version of Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a) contains an unfortunate typo, due to the publisher, in Lemma 20, p. 230. The second premise of the condition is written as(yi,α−i)∈H,whereas it should be(yi,β−i)∈H.:(xi,α−i)∈Hand(yi,β−i)∈H}⇒{(xi,β−i)∈Hor(zi,α−i)∈H,with the understanding that (xi, α−i) denotes the vector of evaluations of an alternative e such that gi(e) = xiand gj(e) = αj, for all j ≠ i.Taking i = 1, xi= 50, yi= 100, zi= 0, α−i= (100, 100, 50, 25, 25), β−i= (75, 100, 25, 25, 25), we obtain :b=(50,100,100,50,25,25)∈Ha=(100,75,100,25,25,25)∈Handc=(50,75,100,25,25,25)∈Ld=(0,100,100,50,25,25)∈L.This completes the proof.□The above proposition shows that there are assignments that can be obtained with ETRI-C-a (or ETRI-C-d) that cannot be obtained with ETRI-B-pc after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. In fact, the above proof shows more. Because the assignment obtained with ETRI-C-a (or ETRI-C-d) violates the necessary condition obtained in Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a, Lemma 20 and Theorem 21, p. 230), we could strengthen the above proposition allowing, not only for a change in the profiles, but also for a change of the indifference and preference thresholds (provided they remain equal, since the results in Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a) only cover this case), a change in the weights and a change in the cutting level λ. Indeed, in the conjoint measurement approach used in Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a), the condition exhibited above is necessary for a partition to be obtained with ETRI-B-pc, whatever the indifference and preference thresholds (provided they are equal), the weights, the cutting level and the limiting profile betweenHandL.Observe finally that, allowing for veto effects in ETRI-B-pc, would not change the conclusion of the above proposition, as long as we suppose, as in Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a), that veto effects occur in an all or nothing way, i.e.,taking the valued relation to 0 as soon as there is a veto effect and keeping it unchanged otherwise. Indeed, in this case, a necessary condition (see Bouyssou and Marchant, 2007a, Theorem 35, p. 237, observing that the condition below is easily seen to be equivalent to the conjunction of conditions lineariand 3v-gradedi) for a partition to be obtained with ETRI-B-pc is that (using the notation presented in the above proof)(xi,α−i)∈Hand(zi,γ−i)∈Hand(yi,β−i)∈H}⇒{(xi,β−i)∈Hor(zi,α−i)∈H.Observing that ETRI-C-a and ETRI-C-d with the parameters used above lead to assign the alternative (0, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100) in categoryH(this alternative playing the role of (zi, γ−i) in the above condition) shows that the impossibility to represent the information obtained using ETRI-B-pc is not due to the fact that an evaluation of 0 on g1 prevents any alternative having such an evaluation from belonging toH.This is a more difficult case since the analysis in Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a); 2007b) does not apply to ETRI-B-pd. Indeed, they have shown that the logic underlying ETRI-B-pd seems to be different from the one underlying ETRI-B-pc. This difference between the two versions of ETRI-B has also been observed in many works dedicated to the elicitation of parameters in ETRI-B that mainly concentrate on ETRI-B-pc.Our aim is to establish the following proposition.Proposition 3There are ordered partitions that can be obtained with ETRI-C-a and that cannot be obtained with ETRI-B-pd, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. The same conclusion holds with ETRI-C-d instead of ETRI-C-a.We consider the same example as in the proof of Proposition 2 and use the same notation. We have with both ETRI-C-a and ETRI-C-d,a∈H,b∈H,c∈L,d∈L.Let π be the limiting profile betweenHandLused in ETRI-B-pd. Let us show that the only way to make the above assignments compatible with ETRI-B-pd is to choose g1(π) = 50.With ETRI-B-pd, we have,x∈H⇔Not[πPλx],x∈L⇔πPλx.We haveb=(50,100,100,50,25,25)∈Ha=(100,75,100,25,25,25)∈Handc=(50,75,100,25,25,25)∈Ld=(0,100,100,50,25,25)∈L.Hence, we know thatNot[πPλ(xi,α−i)]andNot[πPλ(yi,β−i)]together withπPλ(xi,β−i)andπPλ(zi,α−i)Suppose thatNot[πSλ(xi,α−i)]andNot[πSλ(yi,β−i)]. Because πSλ(zi, α−i),Not[πSλ(xi,α−i)]implies that πimust be strictly below xiand greater than or equal to zi. Because πSλ(xi, β−i),Not[πSλ(yi,β−i)]implies that πimust be strictly below yiand greater than or equal to xi. This is clearly impossible.Suppose that (xi, α−i) Sλπ and (yi, β−i) Sλπ. Because (xi, α−i) Sλπ andNot[(zi,α−i)Sλπ],πimust be strictly above ziand less than or equal to xi. Because (yi, β−i) Sλπ andNot[(xi,β−i)Sλπ],πimust be strictly above xiand less than or equal to yi. This is clearly impossible.Suppose thatNot[πSλ(xi,α−i)]and (yi, β−i) Sλπ. Because πSλ(zi, α−i) andNot[πSλ(xi,α−i)],πimust be strictly below xiand greater than or equal to zi. Because (yi, β−i) Sλπ andNot[(xi,β−i)Sλπ],πimust be strictly above xiand less than or equal to zi. This is clearly impossible.Finally suppose that (xi, α−i) Sλπ andNot[πSλ(yi,β−i)]. Because (xi, α−i) Sλπ andNot[(zi,α−i)Sλπ],πimust be strictly above ziand less than or equal to xi. Because πSλ(xi, β−i),Not[πSλ(yi,β−i)]implies that πimust be strictly below yiand greater than or equal to xi. This is the only possible case and we must have that πiis equal to xi= 50.Let us now show that we must have πi= 50, for all i ∈ N. We already know that π1 = 50. Because the weight of criteria w1 = w4 = w5 = w6 = 0.16, it is clear, exchanging the roles of g1 and giwith i = 4, 5, 6, that the above example also shows that we must have π1 = π4 = π5 = π6 = 50. The situation is slightly more difficult with g2 and g3 since their weights are different from the weight of g1. Nevertheless the same example also works.Indeed, for g2, it suffices to consider the following alternatives:g1g2g3g4g5g6a′75100100252525b′10050100502525c′7550100252525d′1000100502525The reader will easily check that we havea′∈H,b′∈H,c′∈L,d′∈L,with both ETRI-C-a and ETRI-C-d.Similarly, for g3, it suffices to consider the following alternatives:g1g2g3g4g5g6a′′10075100252525b′′10010050502525c′′1007550252525d′′1001000502525The reader will easily check that we havea′′∈H,b′′∈H,c′′∈L,d′′∈L,with both ETRI-C-a and ETRI-C-d.Hence, if the above partition (i.e.,the one in which we have specified the assignment of a, b, c, d, a′, b′, c′, d′, a′′, b′′, c′′, and d′′) is to be represented using ETRI-B-pd, it must be true that π = (50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50).Let us finally show that this leads to a contradiction. Consider the alternative e1 that has the evaluation 60 on all criteria except on a criterion 1 on which its evaluation is 25. The reader will easily check that the alternative e is assigned toLwith both ETRI-C-a and ETRI-C-d. Since we now know the profile in ETRI-B-pd, it is easy to check that this leads to a contradiction. Indeed, we must have that πPλe1. This implies that ∑j ≠ 1wj= 0.84 < λ = 0.6, a contradiction.□Considering, at the end of the above proof, not only e1 but all the alternatives, ei, i = 1, 2, …, 6 (eibeing the alternative evaluated at 60 on all criteria except on a criterion i on which its evaluation is 25), it is easy to show that the contradiction remains even allowing for the use of a different set of weights and a different cutting levels in ETRI-B-pd. Indeed, we must have that πPλei, for all i ∈ N. This implies that, for all i ∈ N, we have:wi≥λand∑j≠iwj<λ,a contradiction.This is also a difficult case since we do not have at hand an analysis similar to that of Bouyssou and Marchant (2007a); 2007b) for ETRI-C. In order to keep things simple, we only analyze this case under the following two assumptions.(a)If π is the limiting profile used in ETRI-B to separate two categories, in ETRI-C the central profile of the higher category (ωk) strictly dominates π and π strictly dominates the central profile of the lower category (ωk − 1). This seems an innocuous requirement that ensures a minimal semantic consistency between the profiles that are manipulated.We require that hyper-strict separability holds in the sense of Almeida-Dias et al. (2010, Condition 3), i.e.,that, on all criteria, the central profile of the higher category is strictly preferred to the central profile of the lower category. Although this hypothesis is not completely necessary to prove the proposition below, it facilitates things greatly and appears to be quite reasonable.Our aim is to establish the following proposition.Proposition 4Under the two assumptions (a) and (b) made above, there are ordered partitions that can be obtained with ETRI-B-pc and that cannot be obtained with ETRI-C-a, after a suitable redefinition of the profiles. The same is true with ETRI-B-pd instead of ETRI-B-pc. The above two conclusions hold with ETRI-C-d, instead of ETRI-C-a.Our example has 11 criteria and 2 categories. For all criteria, in order to simplify the presentation, the preference and indifference threshold are both null. The weight of all criteria is equal to 1/11. We suppose that, on all criteria, the veto thresholds have been chosen so as to have no effect. The cutting level λ is taken to be 0.52, so that 1/2 < λ < 6/11 and a coalition of six criteria among the set of 11 is necessary to obtain Sλ.The limiting profile π between the two categories is at 10 on all criteria. Consider now the alternative a = (0, 0, 0, 0, 10 + α, 10 + α, 10 + α, 10 + α, 10 + α, 10 − ɛ, 10 − ɛ) with α, ɛ > 0 (see Table 4). We have s(π, a) = 6/11 and s(a, π) = 5/11. This implies πPλa. Hence, alternative a is assigned to the lower category with either ETRI-B-pc or ETRI-B-pd.We denote the central profile of the higher (resp. lower) category by H (resp. L). Our hypotheses imply that, for all i ∈ N, we have gi(H) > 10 > gi(L). Adjusting, if needed, the evaluation of a on the first four criteria, it is easy to see that it is not restrictive to suppose that, for all i ∈ N, we have gi(L) > 0. Hence, we may choose α, ɛ to be such that 10 + α > gi(H) > 10, i = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 − ɛ > gj(L) > 0, j = 10, 11. Whatever the choice of gi(H) and gi(L) compatible with our hypotheses, we obtain: s(H, a) = 6/11, s(a, H) = 5/11, s(L, a) = 4/11, s(a, L) = 7/11. Hence, with either ETRI-C-a or ETRI-C-d, alternative a is assigned to the higher category. This completes the proof.□The present investigation, as well as our earlier work on ELECTRE TRI-B (see Bouyssou and Marchant, 2007a; 2007b), has lead us to analyze closely the behavior of this method. We have been intrigued by a number of features of this method that we detail in Section 4.1. It turns out that it is possible to propose a simple variant ETRI-B that behaves more in accordance to our intuition w.r.t. these features. We present it in Section 4.2. The pros and cons of this simple variant are then analyzed in Section 4.3.
