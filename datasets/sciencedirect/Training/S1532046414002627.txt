@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Evaluating and selecting software packages that meet the requirements of an organization are difficult aspects of software engineering process. Selecting the wrong open-source EMR software package can be costly and may adversely affect business processes and functioning of the organization. This study aims to evaluate and select open-source EMR software packages based on multi-criteria decision-making. A hands-on study was performed and a set of open-source EMR software packages were implemented locally on separate virtual machines to examine the systems more closely. Several measures as evaluation basis were specified, and the systems were selected based a set of metric outcomes using Integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS. The experimental results showed that GNUmed and OpenEMR software can provide better basis on ranking score records than other open-source EMR software packages.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Open-source software (OSS) packages in health informatics online are increasing and gaining greater prominence. This repertoire of open source options benefits future planners interested in adopting a system by selecting an existing application. Software firms have been producing a variety of OSS that can be customized to meet the specific needs of an organization. The selecting inappropriate OSS adversely affects business processes and organizational functions. The task of selecting OSS packages has become more complex because of (i) difficulties in accessing the applicability of the software for business needs given that a large number of software packages are available in the market; (ii) incompatibilities between various hardware and software systems; (iii) lack of technical knowledge and experience of decision makers; and (iv) ongoing improvements in information technology [1,5]. Evaluators tasked to select an OSS is often under schedule pressure and may not have the time or experience to plan the selection process in detail. Therefore, evaluators may not use the most appropriate method for OSS selection [2]. The process of determining an OSS package that meets specific needs of an organization is complicated and time consuming. Such difficulty has led researchers to investigate better means of evaluating and selecting software packages. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem means making preference decisions over the available alternatives characterized by multiple (usually conflicting) attributes [3]. MCDM aims to help decision makers select the best alternative, sort out potential alternatives among the available options, and rank the alternatives in decreasing order of their performance [4,5]. The evaluation and selection processes involve simultaneous consideration of multiple attributes to rank the available alternatives and select the best one. Therefore, this process can be considered an MCDM problem.As much as there are variety in healthcare subfields and activities, there are different types of applications. This could be noted in the projects categories listed in open source healthcare repositories online, Medical Free/Libre and Open Source Software list [17,18]. An example of application classification in the literature is given in [19], where the author’s defined 15 functional classes specific to the medical domain based on the predominant functionality of the projects. Some of these classes are Clinical Information System/Electronic Medical Records System, Messaging, Continuing Medical Education, Data Acquisition, Decision Support, Imaging, Issue Tracking, Laboratory Information System and Telemedicine. In this paper, we consider only the first (and the dominant application type): open source electronic health record/electronic medical record (HEREHR/EMR) software packages. The focus of this study is to evaluate and select open-source EMR software packages based MCDM using integrated AHP–TOPSIS in group contents from the available options of open-source EMR software. The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 covers the related research and objectives of the present study. Section 3 describes the decision-making methodology for selecting open-source EMR software packages. Section 4 presents the evaluation and discussion of the results. Sections 5 and 6 discuss the limitations and contributions of this research, respectively. Section 7 presents the conclusion.
