@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we compare the residual lifetime of a used coherent system of aget>0with the lifetime of the similar coherent system made up of used components of age t. Here ‘similar’ means that the system has the same structure and the component lifetimes have the same dependence (joint reliability copula). Some comparison results are obtained for the likelihood ratio order, failure rate order, reversed failure rate order and the usual stochastic order. Similar results are reported for comparing inactivity time of a coherent system with lifetime of similar coherent system having component lifetimes same as inactivity times of failed components.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Study of coherent systems plays a relevant role in the field of reliability and survival analysis. A particular case of coherent system is an r-out-of-n system, i.e., a system which functions if, and only if, at least r out of the n components of the system function. Further the series and parallel systems are n-out-of-n and 1-out-of-n systems, respectively. The reader may refer to Barlow and Proschan (1981) for a detailed study of coherent systems. In many practical situations it may be of interest to compare the residual lifetimeTS=(T(X)-t|T(X)>t)of a used coherent system of aget>0with the lifetimeTC=T(Y)of the similar coherent system made up of used components of age t; hereX=(X1,…,Xn),Y=(Y1,…,Yn),T(X)is the lifetime of the new system andYi=(Xi-t|Xi>t),i=1,…,nare residual lifetimes of used components. Here ‘similar’ means that the system has the same structure and the lifetimesXandYhave the same joint reliability copula. Note thatTCis different from(T(X)-t|X1>t,…,Xn>t).Consider a random variable X having the Lebesgue probability density functionf(x),x∈R=(-∞,∞), the distribution functionF(x)=P(X⩽x),x∈R, and the reliability/survival functionF‾(x)=1-F(x)=P(X>x),x∈R. Further suppose thatF(0)=0and{x∈R:f(x)>0}=(0,∞). Letηf(x)=-f′(x)/f(x),x∈(0,∞)be the corresponding eta function (cf. Glaser, 2001). The residual life time at a age/timet⩾0is denoted byXt=X-t|X>t, and the inactivity time of X at timet⩾0is denoted byX(t)=t-X|X⩽t. The aging properties and the stochastic comparison results of the residual life time and the inactivity time are extensively studied in the literature, see for example Block, Savits, and Singh (1998), Chandra and Roy (2001), Ross (1996), Li and Lu (2003), Li and Zuo (2004), Misra, Gupta, and Dhariyal (2008), Pellerey and Petakos (2002), Zhang and Li (2003), Eryilmaz (2012) and Si, Wang, Hu, and Zhou (2011). Also for the study of the eta functions one may refer to Glaser (2001). Throughout this paper the terms increasing/decreasing will be used for non-decreasing/non-increasing. Some definitions which may be found in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007) are presented below for the sake of completeness in presentation.Definition 1LetZ1andZ2be two random variables with Lebesgue probability density functionsf1(·)andf2(·), distribution functionsF1(·)andF2(·), and reliability functionsF‾1(·)=1-F1(·)andF‾2(·)=1-F2(·), respectively. Suppose thatFi(0)=0, and{x∈R:fi(x)>0}=(0,∞),i=1,2. LetZ1andZ2have the failure rate functionsrZ1(x)=f1(x)/F‾1(x)andrZ2(x)=f2(x)/F‾2(x),x∈(0,∞), reversed failure rate functionsr̃Z1(x)=f1(x)/F1(x)andr̃Z2(x)=f2(x)/F2(x),x∈(0,∞), and the eta functionsηf1(x)=-f1′(x)/f1(x)andηf2(x)=-f2′(x)/f2(x),x∈(0,∞), respectively. ThenZ1is said to be smaller thanZ2in the(a)likelihood ratio (lr) order(Z1⩽lrZ2)iff2(x)/f1(x)increases in x on(0,∞);failure rate (fr) order(Z1⩽frZ2)ifrZ1(x)⩾rZ2(x),∀x∈(0,∞);reversed failure rate (rfr) order(Z1⩽rfrZ2)ifr̃Z1(x)⩽r̃Z2(x),∀x∈(0,∞);usual stochastic (st) order (Z1⩽stZ2) ifF‾1(x)⩽F‾2(x), for allx∈(0,∞).The following equivalences are easy to verify:(1.1)Z1⩽lrZ2⇔lnf2(x)f1(x)isincreasinginx∈(0,∞),⇔ηf1(x)⩾ηf2(x),∀x>0,⇔F‾2F‾1-1(p)isconcaveon(0,1),⇔F‾1F‾2-1(p)isconvexon(0,1),⇔F2F1-1(p)isconvexon(0,1),⇔F1F2-1(p)isconcaveon(0,1);Z1⩽frZ2⇔F‾2F‾1-1(p)pis decreasing on(0,1)⇔F‾1F‾2-1(p)pis increasing on (0,1);Z1⩽rfrZ2⇔F2F1-1(p)pis increasing on(0,1)⇔F1F2-1(p)pis decreasing on (0,1).The following implications are also well known:Z1⩽lrZ2⇒Z1⩽frZ2⇒Z1⩽stZ2;Z1⩽lrZ2⇒Z1⩽rfrZ2⇒Z1⩽stZ2.For these and other equivalences/implications, we refer the reader to Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007).For independently and identically distributed (IID) components, Zhang and Li (2003) proved that the lifetime of a parallel/series system having used/inactive components stochastically dominates the lifetime of a used/inactive parallel/series system, in the usual stochastic ordering. The results of Zhang and Li (2003) are strengthened by Li and Lu (2003) to the likelihood ratio ordering. Further Gupta (2013) strengthened the results of Li and Lu (2003) by proving that the lifetime of an r-out-of-n system having used components stochastically dominates the lifetime of a used r-out-of-n system, in the likelihood ratio ordering. In fact Gupta (2013) finds out the conditions on the structure function under which a coherent system having used/inactive components stochastically dominates the lifetime of a used/inactive coherent system, in the likelihood ratio ordering.Recently some studies have been carried out for coherent systems having dependent components. Navarro, Pellerey, and Di Crescenzo (2015) studied stochastic comparisons between coherent systems having randomized dependent components. Also Gupta and Kumar (2014) have investigated stochastic comparisons of component and system redundancies with dependent components.Considering that components are identically distributed (ID) and that may be dependent, in Section 2, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the system reliability functions so that the lifetime of coherent system having used components perform better/worse than the lifetime of used coherent system, under various stochastic orderings. The result derived in this paper can also be applied to coherent systems with IID components (see for example Navarro & Rychlik, 2010; Navarro & Spizzichino, 2010). The approach used in this paper unifies the results of Zhang and Li (2003), Li and Lu (2003) and Gupta (2013). Applications of derived results are illustrated through various examples.Consider a coherent system comprising of n identical componentsC1,…,Cnhaving random lifetimesX1,…,Xn, respectively, that are identically distributed but may be dependent. Let the coherent system have the structure functionϕ. Also let the lifetimes of these n components have the common probability density functionf(·), the common distribution functionF(·)and the common reliability functionF‾(·)=1-F(·), whereF(0)=0and{x∈R:f(x)>0}=(0,∞). Then the joint reliability function ofX1,…,Xnis(2.1)G‾(x1,…,xn)=PX1>x1,…,Xn>xn=K(F‾(x1),…,F‾(xn)),where K is a multivariate distribution function with support0,∞nand has uniform marginals on[0,1]. In the literature, K is called a reliability copula (see Nelsen, 2006), and the representation (2.1) of the reliability copula is well-known as Sklar’s copula representation.The lifetime of coherent systemϕis denoted byτ(X)=τX1,…,Xnand its reliability function asG‾T(x)=Pτ(X)>x,x∈R.A functionh:[0,1]→[0,1]is called a distorted (or distortion) function if h is continuous, increasing,h(0)=0andh(1)=1. Note that ifF‾is a reliability function and h is a distorted function thenh(F‾(x))defines a reliability function. In that caseh(F‾(x))is called the distorted reliability function. Distorted distributions/functions find applications in various diversified fields such as insurance, pricing, financial risk management etc. One may refer to Denneberg (1990), Quiggin (1982), Sordo and Suarez–Liorens (2011), Wang (1995, 1996), Wang and Young (1998) and Yarri (1987) for details of distorted distributions/functions and their applications.The following lemma provides an useful representation for system reliability functionG‾T(x)as a distorted function of the common reliability functionF‾(x):Lemma 1Navarro, del Águila, Sordo, and Suárez-liorens, 2012Letτ(X)be the lifetime of a coherent system with ID component lifetimesX1,…,Xnhaving the joint reliability copulaK(·)and the common reliability functionF‾(·). Then the system reliability function can be written asG‾T(x)=hF‾(x),where h is a distorted function that depends only on the structure functionϕand the reliability copula K.For a fixedt>0, the residual life of the coherent system having ID componentsX1,…,Xnmay be denoted byτ(X)t=τ(X)-t|τ(X)>t=τX1,…,Xnt.Then the resulting used coherent system (having the lifetimeτ(X)t) has the system reliability function(2.2)G‾TS(x)=Pτ(X)t>x=h(F‾(t+x))h(F‾(t)),x>0,which is a distorted reliability function obtained from reliability functionF‾t(x)=F‾(t+x)/F‾(t)with distorted functionhTS(p)=h(qp)/h(q), whereq=F‾(t).For a fixedt>0, letYi=(Xi-t|Xi>t),i=1,…,nand letXt=Y1,…,YnandX=(X1,…,Xn)have the same copula. Then the lifetime of a coherent system having lifetimesY1,…,Ynand structureϕmay be denoted byτXt. The resulting coherent system having used ID components has the system reliability function(2.3)G‾TC(x)=PτXt>x=hF‾(t+x)F‾(t),x>0,and is the distorted reliability function obtained from reliability functionF‾t(x)=F‾(t+x)/F‾(t)with distorted functionhTC(p)=h(p).In this paper we investigate conditions under which(2.4)τ(X)t⩽∗⩾∗τXt,forafixed(orall)t>0,holds under various stochastic orders∗. We will provide various results in this direction. The proofs of these results are given in the Appendix. The following theorem provides conditions under which (2.4) holds for the likelihood ratio ordering (i.e., conditions under which a coherent system of used ID components performs better/worse than a used coherent system having ID components, in the likelihood ratio ordering).Theorem 1Under the above notation assume thatXtandXhave the same reliability copula. Thenτ(X)t⩽lr⩾lrτXtholds for a fixedt>0(for allt>0) if and only if, one of the following equivalent conditions hold:(a)hqh-1(p)is convex (concave) inp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));hh-1(pq)h-1(q)is concave (convex) inp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));h′p/q/h′pis a decreasing (increasing) inp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));h″ph′p⩾(⩽)h″pqqh′pq,∀0<p<q<1andq=F‾(t)(for all0<p<q<1);whereh′(·)andh″(·), respectively, denote the first order and second order derivatives ofh(·).The following theorem provides conditions under which a coherent system of used ID components performs better/worse than a used coherent system having ID components, in the failure rate ordering.Theorem 2Suppose thatXtandXhave the same reliability copula. Thenτ(X)t⩽fr⩾frτXtholds for a fixedt>0(for allt>0) if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions hold:(a)hpq/hpis decreasing (increasing) inp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));hqh-1(p)pis increasing (decreasing) inp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));1phh-1(pq)h-1(q)is decreasing (increasing) inp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));h′(p)h(p)⩾(⩽)h′pqqhpq, for allp∈(0,q)andq=F‾(t)(for all0<p<q<1).The following theorem provides conditions under which a coherent system of used ID components performs better/worse than a used coherent system having ID components, in the reversed failure rate ordering.Theorem 3Assume thatXtandXhave the same reliability copula. Thenτ(X)t⩽rfr⩾rfrτXtholds for a fixedt>0(for allt>0) if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions hold:(a)1-hqh-1(1-p)h(q)pis increasing (decreasing) inp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));1-hpq1-hphqis decreasing (increasing) inp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));h′phq1-h(p)h(q)⩽(⩾)h′pqq1-hpq, for allp∈(0,q)andq=F‾(t)(for all0<p<q<1).The following theorem provides conditions under which a coherent system of used ID components performs better/worse than a used coherent system having ID components, in the usual stochastic ordering.Theorem 4Suppose thatXtandXhave the same reliability copula. Then,τ(X)t⩽st⩾stτXt,holds for a fixedt>0(for allt>0) if and only if(2.5)hpq⩾(⩽)hphq,forallp∈(0,q)andq=F‾(t)(forall0<p<q<1).The condition (2.5) can be equivalently written ash(u)h(v)⩾(⩽)h(uv),0<u,v<1,which is the same as condition (2.14) in Navarro, del Águila, Sordo, and Suárez-liorens (2013) needed for preservation of the ‘New Better than Used’ (‘New Worse than Used’) property by a coherent system.Now we provide some illustrative examples to study the comparative analysis between a used coherent system having ID components and coherent system of used but functioning ID components. The following example shows that if we consider a series system of n components having dependence structure described by Clayton-Oakes (CO) copula, then a used series system is better than a series system of used but functioning components, under the likelihood ratio ordering.Example 1Letτ(X)=minX1,…,Xnwith ID componentsX1,X2,…,Xnhaving distribution described by Clayton-Oakes (CO) reliability copula:K(u1,…,un)=∑i=1nui1-θ-n-111-θ,0<ui<1,i=1,…,n,whereθ∈(1,∞)is a fixed parameter. For series system distorted function is given as (see for example Navarro et al., 2012):(2.6)h(u)=Ku,…,u=nu1-θ-n-111-θ,u∈(0,1),and(2.7)h′(u)=nn-n-1uθ-1θ1-θ,u∈(0,1).Now for fixedq∈(0,1), considerψ1,q(p)=h′pqh′p=qθmq,θ(p)+1θ1-θ,p∈(0,q),wheremq,θ(p)=nqθ-1-1n-n-1pθ-1,p∈(0,q).Clearlymq,θ(p)is a decreasing function of p on(0,q). This implies thatψ1,q(p)is an increasing function of p in(0,q). Now, using Theorem 1, it follows thatτ(X)t⩾lrτXt.The following example shows that their exist coherent systems whereτ(X)t⩾stτXtdoes not hold (i.e., the systems corresponding toτ(X)tandτXtare not ordered with respect to any of stochastic orders defined in Definition 1) andτ(X)t⩽lrτXtholds (i.e., the systems corresponding toτ(X)tandτXtare ordered in a different way than in Example 1).Example 2Letτ(X)=minX1,max(X2,X3)with component lifetimesX1,X2,X3, having distribution described by reliability copula:K(u1,u2,u3)=u1u2u3(1+α(2-u1-u2)(1-u3)),0<ui<1,i=1,2,3,whereα∈[-0.5,0.5]is a fixed parameter. Now consider the following two cases:Case 1. Letα=-0.5. Then, for the systemτ(X), distorted function is given as (see for example Navarro et al., 2012):h(u)=Ku,u,1+Ku,1,u-Ku,u,u=(2+α)u2-(1+4α)u3+5αu4-2αu5,u∈(0,1)and,h′(u)=2(2+α)u-3(1+4α)u2+20αu3-10αu4,u∈(0,1).For fixedq=0.4, we observe that the functionsh(p/q)andh(p)/h(q), as functions of p, cross each other on(0,0.4)(see Fig. 1). Therefore, using Theorem 4, neitherτ(X)t⩽stτXtnorτ(X)t⩾stτXtholds.Case 2. If we chooseα=0, then the we get independent copulaK(u1,u2,u3)=u1u2u3. The distorted function ish(p)=2p2-p3and, for fixedq∈(0,1),h′(pq)h′(p)=1q21-(1-q)4p4p-3p2,is a decreasing function of p on(0,1). Now, Using Theorem 1, it follows thatτ(X)t⩽lrτXt.The following example shows that if we consider IID components, then r-out-of-n system of used components is better than a used r-out-of-n system under likelihood ratio ordering.Example 3Consider r-out of n system,r⩽n, with IID components. Then the distorted function is given byh(p)=n!(n-r)!(r-1)!∫1-p1un-r(1-u)r-1du,∀p∈(0,1).Therefore, from Corollary 2.1 of Gupta (2013) it follows thath′(p/q)/h′(p)is deceasing function of p on(0,1). Hence using Theorem 1 it follows thatτ(X)t⩽lrτXt.The notion of inactivity time is associated with past lifetime and time since failure. Studying the inactivity time is useful in Forensic science, estimation of left-censored data etc (refer to Nanda, Singh, Misra, & Paul, 2003). Here we provide a brief discussion on stochastic comparison of inactivity time of a coherent with a system comprising of components whose lifetimes are the same as inactivity times of failed components. Denote the inactivity time of a coherent system having ID componentsX1,…,Xnbyτ(X)(t)=τX1,…,Xn(t). Then the reliability function ofτ(X)(t)is given byG‾TS∗(x)=Pτ(X)(t)>x=1-h(F‾(t-x))1-h(F‾(t)),0<x<t. Similarly denote the lifetime of a coherent system comprising of components having lifetimesY1∗,…,Yn∗, whereYi∗=(t-Xi|Xi⩽t),i=1,…,n, byτX(t)=τY1∗,…,Yn∗. Clearly the reliability function ofτ(X(t))is given byG‾TC∗(x)=PτX(t)>x=h1-F‾(t-x)1-F‾(t),0<x<t. Here we have assumed that(Y1∗,…,Yn∗)and(X1,…,Xn)have the same reliability copula. Then the following results may be obtained (proofs of these results are similar to proofs of Theorems 1–4, hence omitted):R1τ(X)(t)⩽lr⩾lrτX(t), holds for a fixedt>0(for allt>0) if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions hold:(a)1-h1-qh-1(p)is a convex (concave) function ofp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));1-h1-h-1(1-(1-p)q)1-h-1(1-q)is a convex (concave) function ofp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));h′1-p1-q/h′pis an increasing (decreasing) function ofp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));h″ph′p+h″1-p1-q1-qh′1-p1-q⩽(⩾)0,∀p∈(q,1)andq=F‾(t)(for all0<q<p<1).τ(X)(t)⩽fr⩾frτX(t), holds for a fixedt>0(for allt>0) if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions hold:(a)h1-p1-q/1-hpis an increasing (decreasing) function ofp∈(0,1)forq=F‾(t)(for allq∈(0,1));h′p1-hp⩾(⩽)h′1-p1-q1-qh1-p1-q,∀p∈(q,1)andq=F‾(t)(for all0<q<p<1).τ(X)(t)⩽rfr⩾rfrτX(t), holds for a fixedt>0(for allt>0) if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions hold:(a)1-h1-p1-q1-1-hp1-hqis an increasing (decreasing) function of p on(q,1)forq=F‾(t)(for all0<q<p<1).h′1-p1-q1-qh1-p1-q⩾(⩽)h′(p)1-h(p),∀p∈(q,1)andq=F‾(t)(for all0<q<p<1).τ(X)(t)⩽st⩾stτX(t)holds for a fixedt>0(for allt>0) if and only if1-h(p)1-h(q)⩽(⩾)h1-p1-q,∀p∈(q,1)andq=F‾(t)(for all0<q<p<1).Consider a series system with CO copula as described in Example 1. Suppose thatθ⩾2. Now for fixedq∈(0,1)andp∈(q,1), consider(2.8)h′1-p1-qh′p=n-n-1(1-p)θ-1(1-q)θ-1θ1-θn-n-1pθ-1θ1-θ=(1-q)θuq,θ(p)-vq,θ(p)θ1-θ,whereuq,θ(p)=n1-qθ-1n-n-1pθ-1,and,vq,θ(p)=(n-1)1-pθ-1n-n-1pθ-1. Clearly for a fixedq∈(0,1),uq,θ(p)is an increasing function of on(q,1). Alsovq,θ′(p)=(n-1)θ-11-pθ-2n-n-1pθ-12-n+(n-1)pθ-2⩽0,∀p∈(q,1).Thusvq,θ(p)is a decreasing function of p on(q,1). Now from (2.8) it is clear thath′1-p1-qh′pis an increasing function of p on(q,1)forθ⩾2. Using R1, it follows thatτ(X)(t)⩽lrτX(t).
