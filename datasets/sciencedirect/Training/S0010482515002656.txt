@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The complete denture is prepared with a high dimensional accuracy in order to fit with the oral mucosa. But, long-term use of the complete denture results in the formation of gaps between the denture and the residual ridge because of the spontaneous absorption of bone. Home reliner (HR) is readily available at pharmacies, and is used to provide pain relief from ill-fitting dentures by its cushioning effect. However, for decades, many reports have expressed negative opinions about HR [1,2]. The guidelines of the Japan Prosthodontic Society indicate that HR has low flow material property, leading to a shift in the mounting position of complete dentures and consequent residual ridge resorption as a result of the shift of the occlusal vertical dimension and centric occlusal position [3].Recently, Murata et al. conducted in vitro experiments with HR and reported its physical properties [4]. They suggested that HR should not be recommended, because it had almost no cushioning effect. As reasons, they indicated that HR had overly large flow properties just after an oral application and that its physical properties denatured after a day. In contrast, Udo-Yamakawa, Koronis, and Uysal conducted clinical studies of HR and concluded that it is an effective material if used temporarily under the guidance of dentists [5,6], because HR had improved patients׳ masticatory satisfaction [5–7].HR is abused by many patients, although it is not recommended; however, there are very few scientific studies of the ill effects of HR. Recently, some researchers pointed out that past studies lacked scientific evidence [6], and some reports expressed affirmative opinions about HR, contrary to conventional negative opinions. However, the effect of HR on occlusal relationships and the oral mucosa has remained unclear.FEM is a common simulation method based on decades of experience. In dentistry, many FEM simulations are performed to calculate the stress and strain distributions of solid materials. FEM is applied not only to linear but also to nonlinear calculations in many cases [8,9]. Examples include contact analyses of the implant–bone or implant–abutment [10–12], nonlinear analysis of periodontal ligaments [13], viscoelastic analysis of the masticatory mucosa [14], and large deformation analysis of glass fiber-reinforced composite clasps [15]. Despite the advances in FEM, it can be difficult to simulate soft and amorphous materials such as HR, because FEM represents materials as grids.In recent years, the particle method has been applied for simulating soft and amorphous materials. This method represents materials as a mass of particles so that amorphous deformations can be calculated flexibly. The SPH method is a particle method designed to calculate galactic impacts in space physics [16]. Modern SPH methods can simulate solids, fluid, and powders, which have nonlinear properties [17–20]. In industry, SPH is applied for the development of designs that involve problems not amenable to FEM.With the examples of the oral mucosa, impression materials, and relining materials, there are many materials in dentistry that have viscoelastic properties and deform amorphously. Thus, the SPH method could be a very effective simulation method in dentistry. However, the method has not yet been applied for intraoral conditions that require high-dimensional dynamic models.In this study, we implemented an SPH program using a high-dimensional dynamic model. We numerically simulated how occlusal relationships and the oral mucosa were affected by HR, on the assumption that a patient applied it to the upper complete denture.We implemented an SPH program having functions of elastic calculation and a four-element Voigt model for viscoelastic calculation.A generalized Voigt model is a dynamic model suitable for calculating the creep phenomenon of viscoelastic materials such as biological objects. Previous experiments and simulations in dentistry have applied four-element Voigt models for the oral mucosa [21–23].Therefore, in this study, we implemented a four-element Voigt model viscoelastic calculation algorithm by inserting a generalized Voigt model formulation of FEM [24] into the SPH method׳s basic algorithm [25].The evaluation formula for the spatial gradient that lies at the base of the SPH algorithm is expressed by formula (1) as below.(1)∇⋅f(x)≈−∑J=1NmJρJf(xJ)⋅∇W(x−xJ,h)f expresses a function of a three-dimensional position vector x, and N expresses the number of particles that lie inside the radius h of the influence circle of a particle.m,ρ,andWdenote the mass, density, and weight function of particles, respectively. A second-order spline curve is applied as a weight function.The behavior of each particle is expressed by the equations below.For the analysis of an elastic field by SPH, the equation of motion by stress gradient in the continuum field is applied(2)a=1ρ∇⋅σa,ρ,andσdenote acceleration, density, and the Cauchy stress tensor of a particle, respectively. Eq. (2) corresponds to Newton׳s equation of motion. Acceleration of particle is calculated by substituting Eq. (1) in Eq. (2). The velocity of a particle is calculated by the acceleration and time increment. Subsequently, the strain change ratio of a particle({ε̇})is calculated by the velocity of the particle and time increment.The stress change ratio of a four-element Voigt model in a multiaxial stress field is calculated at every time step by Eqs. (3)–(7) (Fig. 1). For the elicitation process of Eqs. (3)–(5), refer to Appendix.(3){ε̇}=[DMe]{ε̇}−{Ȧ}(4){Ȧ}=[DMe]([ηM]−1+[ηV]−1){σ}−[DMe][ηV]−1[DVe]{εV}(5){ε̇V}=[ηV]−1{σ}−[ηV]−1[DVe]{ε̇}In relation to{σ}and{εV}, the previous time step values are plugged in series.[DMe]and[DVe]represent the stiffness matrix of the spring element of a four-element Voigt model.[ηM]−1and[ηV]−1represent a matrix of dashpot elements of the four-element Voigt model. These matrices are calculated as follows:(6)[DMg(V)e]=EM(V)(1+ν)(1−2ν)[1−ννν0001−νν0001−ν000(1−2ν)/200sym.(1−2ν)/20(1−2ν)/2](7)[ηM(V)]−1=[19ηKM(V)+13ηGM(V)19ηKM(V)−16ηGM(V)19ηKM(V)−16ηGM(V)00019ηKM(V)+13ηG19ηKM(V)−16ηGM(V)00019ηKM(V)+13ηGM(V)0001/ηGM(V)00sym.1/ηGM(V)01/ηGM(V)]Edenotes Young׳s modulus,νdenotes Poisson׳s ratio,ηGM(V)denotes the coefficient of viscosity for shearing deformation, andηKM(V)denotes the coefficient of viscosity for volume deformation. In this research, as incompressibility materials, the values of all materials׳ηKM(V)were set to be infinite. The particle׳s acceleration is decided by substituting the stress increment from Eq. (3) into Eq. (2).For the elastic materials, the stress change ratio is calculated as shown in Eq. (8), that is, by removal of the corrected stress by viscosity({Ȧ})from Eq. (3).(8){σ̇}=[DMe]{ε̇}On the assumption that a patient applies HR to the part of the residual ridge inside his upper complete denture and bites twice according to the instruction manual, we set the conditions of simulations as follows. In this preliminary study of viscoelastic analysis of HR and the oral mucosa by the SPH method, we performed two-dimensional simulations.The simulation models were created from Standard Triangulation Language (STL) data of an edentulous jaw plaster model with a bite plate (NC-N4; Nissin Dental Products Inc., Kyoto, Japan). STL data were sliced at the position of the first molar. Every simulation model was created symmetrically (Blender; Blender Foundation, Amsterdam, Netherlands) (Paint; Microsoft, Redmond, USA) (Fig. 2(a)). The thickness of the oral mucosa was set as follows according to the measurement by Uchida et al. [26]. The crest of the residual ridge was set to 2mm, the vicinity of the median palatine suture was set to 1.5mm, and the inclined plane of the palatine was set to 5mm. The thickness of the cortical bone was set to 1.5mm by reference to a previous study [27]. The bite plate was treated as an upper complete denture without changing the original form. A well-fitting denture model was set as the control model. Other ill-fitting denture models were defined to have 1-mm clearance between the denture base and the crest of the residual ridge, and the thickness of the HR was set as shown inTable 1. Model 0–0 described the case without using HR, model 2–2 described the use of a proper amount of HR, model 4–4 described the use of an excessive amount of HR, and model 2–4 described the case in which one side received the proper amount of HR and the other side received an excessive amount of HR. Each model was converted into a particle model by means of a generator program (Fig. 2 (b)–(f)).The material properties were set as follows (Table 2,Fig. 3). Young׳s modulus of the cortical bone and denture base were set to previously reported values [28,29]. For the oral mucosa, Young׳s modulus and viscosity of the four-element Voigt model were set according to a previous study [22]. HR (Cushion correct®; Shionogi, Osaka, Japan) was measured using a creep meter (RE2-33005S; YAMADEN, Tokyo, Japan), and Young׳s modulus and viscosity of the four-element Voigt model were set as ad hoc parameters, according to the result of the creep experiment. Poisson׳s ratio for all materials was set to 0.3.Calculations were performed as follows. The viscoelastic theory ((Eqn. (3)–(7)) was used for calculating oral mucosa and HR. The elastic theory (Eqn. (8)) was used for calculating the denture and the cortical bone. The large deformation theory was used for calculating HR, and the infinitesimal deformation theory was used for calculating other materials (Appendix B). Displacement of the denture in the X- and Y-axis directions and the stress and strain were dynamically calculated at every time step. The oral mucosa was divided into six bilaterally symmetric areas as shown in Fig. 2 (g), and the mean value of von Mises stress per particle for each area was calculated at every time step.The boundary conditions were set as follows. All particles of the cortical bone were completely fixed in all directions. The particles of the oral mucosa that compose the contiguous region of the cortical bone and bottom of the model were completely fixed in all directions. Other particles of all materials were set free.The loading condition was set in consideration of the chewing cycle of edentulous patients who had used denture adhesives [30,31] and on the basis of past simulation studies of denture liners [32,33]. The loading amount was linearly increased to 10N from 0 to 0.075s, then linearly decreased to 0N in 0.075s, and thereafter continuously unloaded to 0.6s (Fig. 4). This loading cycle was repeated twice for reproducing the situation of inserting an upper complete denture to which HR has been applied, according to the instruction manual. The loading points were set at the centers of the right and left occlusal surfaces.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Viscoelastic analysis by the SPH method is effective for analysis of HR and the oral mucosa.Within the limitations of this study, if an improper amount of HR was applied, the occlusal vertical dimension would increase. In particular, in the case when the denture is set in an inclined position, pressure on the oral mucosa would greatly increase where originally fitted with the denture base more than that under non-HR conditions. A proper amount of HR may reduce the stress on the oral mucosa more than that under non-HR conditions. However, a well-fitting denture would be the most effective for distributing occlusal pressure.
