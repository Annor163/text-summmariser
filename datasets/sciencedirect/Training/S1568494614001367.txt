Paper presents predator–prey based optimization (PPO) technique to obtain optimal generation scheduling of short-term hydrothermal system. PPO is a part of the swarm intelligence family and is capable to solve large scale non-linear optimization problems. PPO based algorithm combines the idea of particle swarm optimization concept with predator effect that helps to, maintain diversity in the swarm and preventing premature convergence to local sub-optimal. In this paper first of all feasible solution is obtained through random heuristic search and then thermal and hydro power generations are searched for optimum hydrothermal scheduling problem using PPO. Variable elimination method is implemented to handle the equality constraint by eliminating variable explicitly. These eliminated variables are considered by penalty method restricts slack units with in limits. Slack thermal generating unit for each sub-interval handles power balance equality constraint and slack hydro units handle water equality constraint. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on, fixed-head and variable-head hydrothermal power systems. The results obtained from the proposed technique are compared with the existing technique. From the numerical results, it is experienced that the PPO based approach is able to provide a better solution.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the electric power supply system, there exist a wide range of problems involving optimization processes. Among them, hydrothermal scheduling is an important optimization task in power system operation. Optimization methods are classified based on the type of search space and the objective function along with equality and inequality constraints. In general, the objective function or constraints or both contains nonlinearity giving rise to non-linear problem. The optimal scheduling of hydrothermal power system is basically a complex programming problem involving nonlinear objective function and a mixture of linear and nonlinear constraints. The objective of hydrothermal scheduling is to generate the power economically, whereas satisfying various constraints. The equality constraints include generation-demand balance and balance of available volume-water discharge. The inequality constraints include generation limit on thermal and hydro power unit, limit on water discharge rate and reservoir storage level limit. The hydrothermal scheduling problem is broadly classified as convex and non-convex optimization problem. In convex hydrothermal scheduling problem the input–output characteristics are assumed piecewise linear and monotonically increasing, optimization algorithms that are based on mathematical programming can be applied. Several conventional methods have been used in hydrothermal scheduling for finding the economical hydrothermal generation schedule under practical constraints such as dynamic programming [1], mixed integer programming [2], Lagrange relaxation method [3], Lagrangian multiplier and gradient search techniques [4]. Most of the applied methods make a number of assumptions to simplify the optimization problem, but that may lead to a suboptimal solution.The recent trend is to apply more realistic models for hydro and thermal units. The non-convex hydrothermal model presents the complete, realistic problem having non-smooth characteristics. Such problem requires a fast, accurate and robust solution methodology as it cannot be handled effectively by mathematical programming based optimization methods. Generally, heuristic search methods are used as tool for the solution of complex optimization problems because of their strength to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional optimization methods. Heuristic search techniques has a number of exclusive advantages like robust and reliable performance, global search capability, little information requirement, ease of implementation, parallelism, no requirement of differentiable and continuous objective function. In the past decades, several heuristics search techniques such as genetic algorithm [5–7], evolutionary programming [8,9], simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization (PSO) [10,11] have been proven to be very efficient in solving complex power system problem. Various heuristic search techniques have been reported in the literature pertaining to short-term fixed-head hydrothermal scheduling. Basu has applied evolutionary programming technique [12], simulated annealing technique [13] and real-coded genetic algorithm [14] for solving fixed-head hydrothermal scheduling. Chiang [15] has applied improved genetic algorithm (IGA) equipped with an improved evolutionary direction operator and a migration operation for solving hydrothermal generation scheduling. The artificial immune system technique has been applied for optimal scheduling of thermal plants in coordination with fixed-head hydro units [16]. Petcharaks and Ongsakul [17] have proposed a hybrid enhanced Lagrangian relaxation and quadratic programming based technique for hydrothermal scheduling. Gil et al. [18] have proposed a method to deal with short-term generation scheduling problem for hydrothermal system using genetic algorithm. Sasikal and Ramaswamy [19] have presented an optimal gamma based algorithm for fixed-head hydrothermal problems using genetic algorithm. Mandal and Chakraborty [20] have developed an efficient and reliable PSO based algorithm to solve combined economic-emission scheduling of hydrothermal power systems with cascaded reservoirs. PSO technique has been applied to solve short-term hydrothermal scheduling by Mandal et al. [21]. A biogeography based optimization methodology combined with predator prey approach has been proposed and validated for economic load dispatch by Silva and Coelho [22]. Brabazon et al. [23] have constructed a simulation model using swarm metaphor, to examine the impact of strategic inertia on the adaptation of the strategic fitness of a population.Heuristic search techniques often provide a fast and reasonable solution, but do not ensure global optimal solutions in finite time, so these search techniques belong to the group of approximate algorithm. Several literatures have reported some major shortcomings of different heuristic search technique. Evolutionary programming (EP) is a powerful search technique; however, it is having slow converging characteristics, near optimum solution for some problems [24]. Genetic algorithm (GA) ensures that solutions are changing continually, but sometimes it is deficient of producing better offspring and causes slow convergence near global optimum [25,26]. Differential Evolution (DE) has limited ability to move its population to large distances across the search space if the population is clustered in a limited portion of it [27]. In GA, the worse solutions are discarded and only the good ones are saved. Particle swarm optimization maintains the diversity of the swarm, since all the particles share the information related to the most successful particle in the swarm. PSO converges very fast compared to other search techniques such as Genetic algorithm, Evolutionary programming, etc. [26]. Mahamed et al. [25] have shown that the convergence behavior of PSO depends upon their parameters. Wrong choices of values for these parameters may result in divergent particle trajectories and it causes trapping into local minimum value; so no algorithm can always, surpass the others in all possible optimization problems. The predator–prey model is inspired in the hunt of birds (prey) grouped in swarms attacked by predators. Predators’ effects include additional capability to escape from local minimum position as compared to PSO algorithm [28]. Predators play the role of searching around global best in a concentrated manner, whereas preys explore on a solution space escaping from predators, so predators prevent pre-mature convergence and preys play the role of diversification. Predator prey optimization has been successfully applied to various test problems [28,29]. Silva et al. [28] have presented experimental results of four benchmark multimodal functions solved using standard PSO and its other variants and PPO. They have concluded that PPO performed better than the standard PSO and its other variants. Since optimal scheduling of a hydrothermal power system is also a multimodal problem, so use of a PPO technique may be best suited for this problem. In this paper, PPO technique has been applied on fixed and variable-head scheduling problem and implemented on number of test systems and achieved numerical results. The paper is organized with the introduction of a short-term hydrothermal model followed by elaborative description of a PPO algorithm to achieve the solution. Finally, results are reported and after performing comparison with existing methods the conclusions are outlined.The basic problem is to find optimum active power generation in the system as a function of time. Total generation should meet load demand in each interval and each hydro unit is constrained by the amount of water available for draw down in the planning period. Both fixed and variable-head hydrothermal generation scheduling problems are taken into consideration. Short and long period of time subinterval classify the whole planning period problem as short-term and long-term scheduling period.The objective function to be minimized is the total system operating cost of thermal generating unit for the planned time horizon. The generator operating cost is usually approximated using quadratic function. However, it is more practical to consider the valve-point loading for fossil–fuel-based unit. In this context, a cost function is obtained based on the ripple curve for more accurate modeling. This curve contains higher order nonlinearity and discontinuity due to the valve-point loading effect. One way of representing this effect is to use a rectified sinusoidal function in the cost function [30]. Operating cost function for thermal unit is expressed over the optimization interval given as:(1)F=∑k=1T∑i=1N(aiPik2+biPik+ci+disin{ei(Pimin−Pik)})where ai, bi, ci, diand eiare cost coefficients of ith thermal unit, Pikis real power generation of ith unit during kth subinterval; N is the number of thermal generators, T is total time duration for scheduling,Piminis the lower limit of ith thermal unit.In short-term hydrothermal scheduling problem, an insignificant fuel cost is incurred in the operation of hydro-units. The input-output characteristic of a hydro-generator is expressed by the variation of water discharge, qjkwhich is a function of power output, Pmkand net head, hjk. According to Glimn–Kirchmayer model [31] the discharge rate of jth hydro unit at kth subinterval is given by(2)qjk=Kjφ(Pmk)ψ(hjk)(j=1,2,…,M;m=j+N;k=1,2,…,T)whereφandψare functions of hydro-generations and water head of reservoirs, respectively, Kjis a constant of proportionality, Pmkis hydro power generation and hjkis effective head of jth unit during kth subinterval.ψ(hjk)andφ(Pmk)are represented by quadratic functions:(3)ψ(hjk)=x1jhjk2+y1jhjk+z1j(j=1,2,…,M;k=1,2,…,T)(4)φ(Pmk)=x2jPmk2+y2jPmk+z2j(j=1,2,…,M;m=j+N;k=1,2,…,T)where x1j, y1j, z1jare head variation coefficients and x2j, y2j, z2jare discharge rate coefficients of jth hydro-unit.It is presumed that head is constant over the optimization interval for a large capacity reservoir whereas for a small capacity reservoir; the effective head is variable over the optimization interval. The discharge rate equation can be written as(5)qjk=K′jφ(Pmk)Kjφ(Pmk)ψ(hjk);fixedhead;variablehead(j=1,2,…,M;m=j+N;k=1,2,…,T)The effective head is obtained by assuming that jth hydro unit's reservoir has vertical sides and small capacity. Spillage occurs only when the reservoir storage limit is exceeded. Effective head continuity equation is stated as(6)hj(k+1)=hjk+tkSj(Ikj−qjk)(j=1,2,…,M;k=1,2,…,T)The net water head over the planned time interval is given by:(7)hjt=hj0+1Sj∑k=1TtkIjk−∑k=1Ttkqjk(j=1,2,…,M;k=1,2,…,T)where hj0 is the initial hydraulic head and Sjis the surface area of the reservoir of jth hydro unit, Ijkis the natural inflow and qjkis the rate of water discharge of jth hydro unit during kth subinterval.Short-term hydrothermal scheduling problem is described as minimization of total fuel cost of thermal generating units defined by given set of constraints, which is stated mathematically as below:(8a)MinimizeF=∑k=1T∑i=1N(aiPik2+biPik+ci+disin{ei(Pimin−Pik)})Subjected to following set of constraints:(i)The load demand equality constraint during each sub-interval(8b)∑i=1NTPik=PDk+PLk(k=1,2,…,T)Total water discharge of each hydro unit over planning period should be same as available volume.(8c)∑k=1Ttkqjk=Rj(j=1,2,…,M)The power limits are imposed as on hydro and thermal unit(8d)Pimin≤Pik≤Pimax(i=1,2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T)The discharge limits are imposed on hydro unit(8e)qjmin≤qjk≤qjmax(j=1,2,…,M;k=1,2,…,T)where NT is total number of units. PDkis the power demand and PLkis the transmission loss during kth subinterval.PimaxandPiminare the upper and lower limits of real power, respectively.qimaxandqiminare the upper and lower limits of water discharge, respectively. Rjis predefined volume of water available for jth hydro-unit. Transmission losses in the system during kth sub-interval are represented by Kron's loss formula through B-coefficient [32] is:(8f)PLk=∑i=1NT∑j=1NTPikBijPjk+∑i=1NTPikBio+Boowith Bij, Bioand Booare B-coefficients.The variable-head is updated at each sub-interval using Eq. (6) and it should satisfy Eq. (7) over the planned period.Slack thermal generating unit is used to meet the equality constraint given by Eq. (8b) during each sub-interval and slack hydro generating unit variable is used to satisfy the available water constraint given by Eq. (8c) for each hydro unit over optimization interval. Inequality constraint is handled by applying penalty function. The variable elimination method is used to handle equality constraints only which eliminate one or more variables among decision variables either explicitly or implicitly. The variables eliminated are called dependent variable and remaining decision variables are known as independent variables. Independent variables are searched. Here, explicit elimination technique is applied and dependent variables are called as slack generators.A thermal generating unit is considered as slack unit to meet the equality constraint given by Eq. (8b) during each sub-interval. A slack unit Pskis selected arbitrarily from committed units. The power output of the slack thermal unit ‘s’ is computed by rewriting the energy balance Eq. (8b) when transmission loss is represented by Eq. (8f)(9)Psk+∑i=1i≠sNTPik=∑i=1i≠sNT∑j=1j≠sNTPikBijPjk+∑j=1j≠sNTPjk(Bjs+Bsj)Psk+BssPsk2+∑i=1i≠sNTBioPik+BsoPsk+Boo+PDkAbove equation can be rewritten in quadratic form as:(10)XkPsk2+YkPsk+Zk=0(k=1,2,…,T)whereXk=0;PLk=0Bss;PLk≠0Yk=−1;PLk=0∑j=1j≠sNT(Bjs+Bsj)Pgjk+Bso−1;PLk≠0Zk=PDk−∑i=1i≠sNTPik;PLk=0PDk+Boo+∑i=1i≠sNT∑j=1j≠sNTPikBijPjk+∑i=1i≠sNTBioPik−∑i=1i≠sNTPik;PLk≠0The roots of quadratic equation given by Eq. (10) are obtained as:(11)Psk=PDk−∑i=1i≠sNTPik;PLk=0−Yk±Yk2−4XkZk2Xk;PLk≠0(k=1,2,…,T)The positive real valued root is considered.Similarly, slack hydro generating unit satisfies the available water constraint given by Eq. (8c) for the given scheduling period. Slack hydro units Pmh(m=N+1,…,N+M)are selected arbitrarily from optimization interval for committed hydro units to meet the water equality constraints for the whole scheduling period. The power output of the slack hydro units during ‘h’ time interval is computed by rewriting the water energy balance Eq. (8c).(12)thqjh+∑k=1k≠hTtkqjk=Rj(j=1,2,…,M)Above equation can be rewritten as(13)th(x2jPmh2+y2jPmh+z2j)Tjk+∑k=1k≠hTtkqjk−Rj=0(j=1,2,…,M;m=j+N)whereTjk=K′j;fixedheadKjψ(hjk);variablehead(j=1,2,…,M;m=j+N;k=1,2,…,T)Above equation can be rewritten in quadratic form as:(14)UjPmh2+VjPmh+Wj=0(j=1,2,…,M;m=j+N)whereUj=thx2jVj=thy2jWj=thz2j+1Tjk∑k=1k≠hTtkqjk−RjThe roots of quadratic equation given by Eq. (14) are obtained as:(15)Pmh=−Vj±Vj2−4UjWj2Uj(j=1,2,…,M;m=j+N)Only positive real root of slack hydro power is considered.In case, slack thermal generating unit during each sub-interval and hydro generating units during slack sub-interval violates their limits while searching for optimum solution then exterior penalty method [33] is employed. The penalty function is defined as(16)PN(Pik,qjk)=rp∑k=1TPsk+∑m=N+1NTPmh+∑k=1T∑j=1Mqjk(i=1,2,…,N)wherePsk=(Psk−Psmin)2;ifPsk<Psmin(Psmax−Psk)2;ifPsk>Psmax0;ifPsmin≤Psk≤PsmaxPmh=(Pmh−Pmmin)2;ifPmh<Pmmin(Pmmax−Pmh)2;ifPmh>Pmmax0;ifPmmin≤Pmh≤Pmmaxqjk=(qjk−qjmin)2;ifqjk<qjmin(qjmax−qjk)2;ifqjk>qjmax0;ifqjmin≤qjk≤qjmaxrpis the penalty parameter with higher value, s is slack thermal unit to meet power demand constraint during each sub-interval; h is slack hydro unit to meet the available water constraint for each hydro unit.The augmented objective function is defined as(17)A(Pik,qjk)=F(Pik)+rp∑k=1TPsk+∑m=N+1NTPmh+∑k=1T∑j=1MqjkPredator–prey optimization technique is inspired by hunting habit of predators to a group of animals/birds (prey). It becomes difficult for preys to stay its preferred location when chased by predators and have to search new location. This property of predator helps to explore search area by preys more effectively. The predator–prey optimization technique is based on particle swarm optimization with additional predator chasing property. Particle swarm optimization is a population based search technique and uses swarm intelligence such as bird flocking, fish schooling. Particle changes its position with time based on its own experience and experience of neighboring particles. The position mechanism of the particle in the search space is updated by adding the velocity vector to its position vector as given by Kennedy and Ekrhart [34]. If the predator influences the prey then an exponential term will also be included in velocity vector as given by Silva et al., [28]. Basic PPO algorithm is elaborated below.Algorithm:1.Input data viz. maximum allowed iterations, swarm size, maximum and minimum limit of velocity, maximum probability fear (pf) and other algorithm constants.Randomly initialize the prey positions and predator positions between upper and lower limit of decision variables.Randomly initialize the prey velocities and predator velocities between their predefined upper and lower limits.Compute augmented objective function for all prey population.Assign all prey positions as their local best position.Compute global best position among local best position of prey.Update predator velocity and position.Randomly generate the probability fear between 0 and 1.IF (probability fear>maximum probability fear) THENUpdate prey velocity and position with Predator effectELSEUpdate prey velocity and position without predator effectENDIFCompute augmented objective function for all prey population.Update particles local and global best position of prey particles based on fitness.Check stopping criteria, if not met, repeat from step 7.StopRandomly generate the decision variables prey (thermal and hydro power) within their operating limits for all populations and also generate a single predator. In the first phase all initial prey particles make feasible using heuristic search technique as discuss in Section 5.3 and then in second phase decision variables are searched using PPO for optimum hydrothermal scheduling. Equality constraint is handled using slack bus approach and inequality constraint is handled using exterior penalty method as discussed in Section 3. Elaborative steps are presented in ensuing sub-sections.The initial prey particles are randomly initialized between upper and lower limits of decision variables. It consists ofPikj0initial trial prey position and corresponding velocityVikj0. Position and velocity of prey swarm representing thermal generation is given as:(18)Pikj0=Pimin+r1(Pimax−Pimin)(i=1,2,…,N;i≠s;k=1,2,…,T,j=1,2,…,NP)(19)Vikj0=Vimin+r2(Vimax−Vimin)(i=1,2,…,N;i≠s;k=1,2,…,T,j=1,2,…,NP)where r1 and r2 are uniform random numbers having value between 0 and 1. NP denotes the number of particles in a swarm.Position and velocity of prey swarm representing generation by hydro units is given as:(20)Pmkj0=Pmmin+r1(Pmmax−Pmmin)(m=N+1,N+2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T;k≠h,j=1,2,…,NP)(21)Vmkj0=Vmmin+r2(Vmmax−Vmmin)(m=N+1,N+2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T;k≠h,j=1,2,…,NP)Single predator position for thermal generation,PPik0and velocity,VPik0is randomly initialized within their respective limits except for sth slack thermal units of each subinterval.(22)PPik0=Pimin+r3(Pimax−Pimin)(i=1,2,…,N;i≠s;k=1,2,…,T)(23)VPik0=Vimin+r4(Vimax−Vimin)(i=1,2,…,N;i≠s;k=1,2,…,T)where r3 and r4 are uniform random numbers having value between 0 and 1.Single predator position for hydro generation,PPmk0and velocity,VPmk0is randomly initialized within their respective limits except for hth subinterval of hydro units.(24)PPmk0=Pmmin+r3(Pmmax−Pmmin)(m=N+1,N+2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T;k≠h)(25)VPmk0=Vmmin+r4(Vmmax−Vmmin)(m=N+1,N+2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T;k≠h)The heuristic random search strategy to search the hydro and thermal generations is elaborated here. Two separate search moves are performed. One move tries to meet the available water constraint for every hydro generation unit over planning period and second move tries to meet the demand constraint during each time interval. Mathematically these moves are represented below. Hydro generations are updated as(26)Pmkjt=Pmkjt+Wvr5(Pmmax−Pmmin)ΔRijtif(ΔRijt<0)Pmkjt−Wvr5(Pmmax−Pmmin)ΔRijtif(ΔRijt>0)(i=1,2,…,M;m=i+N,k=1,2,…,T;j=1,2,…,NP)where(27)ΔRijt=∑k=1Ttkqikjt−Rj(i=1,2,…,M;j=1,2,…,NP)r5 is uniform random number having value between 0 and 1 and Wvis scaling factor.Thermal generations are updated as(28)Pikjt=Pikjt−WDr6(Pimax−Pimin)ΔPDkjt;if(ΔPDkjt<0)Pikjt+WDr6(Pimax−Pimin)ΔPDkjt;if(ΔPDkjt>0)(i=1,2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T,j=1,2,…,NP)where(29)ΔPDkjt=PDk+PLk−∑i=1NTPikjt(k=1,2,…,T,j=1,2,…,NP)r6 is uniform random number having value between 0 and 1and WDis scaling factor.The process is repeated till both the constraints are satisfied. It means for each sub-intervalΔPDkjtand for each hydro unitΔRijtshould meet the tolerable termination criterion ‘err’. All the initial generation satisfy equality and inequality constraints.Each prey position is evaluated based on objective function given by Eq. (17). The updated velocity and position of a prey at (t+1) iteration/movements which represents thermal generating unit is calculated by using the following relation(30)Vikjt+1=wVikjt+C1r7(Pbestikjt−Pikjt)+C2r8(Gbestikt−Pikjt)(i=1,2,…,N;i≠s,k=1,2,…,T;j=1,2,…,NP)(31)Pikjt+1=Pikjt+Vikjt+1(i=1,2,…,N;i≠s,k=1,2,…,T;j=1,2,…,NP)where C1 and C2 are the acceleration constant. r7 and r8 are uniform random numbers having value between 0 and 1.Pbestikjtis local best position of ith thermal unit at kth interval for jth population.The updated velocity and position of a prey particle at (t+1) iteration/movements which represents hydro generating unit is calculated by using the following relation(32)Vmkjt+1=wVmkjt+C1r9(Pbestmkjt−Pmkjt)+C2r10(Gbestmkt−Pmkjt)(m=N+1,N+2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T;k≠h;j=1,2,…,NP)(33)Pmkjt+1=Pmkjt+Vmkjt+1(m=N+1,N+2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T;k≠h;j=1,2,…,NP)wherePbestmkjtis local best position of ith unit at kth interval for jth population, r9 and r10 are uniform random numbers having value between 0 and 1.For global exploration higher value of inertia weight (w) and for fine tuning lower value of inertia weight is required. Inertia weight starts from its set maximum value and starts decreasing with increase of iteration.(34)w=wmax−(wmax−wmin)×ITITMAXwhere wmax and wmin represent maximum and minimum value of inertia weight. IT represents iteration count and ITMAXrepresent maximum number of iterations.The Predator's objective is to influence the global best position in the swarm in a control manner. The updated velocity and position of a predator at (t+1) iteration/movements which represents thermal generating unit is calculated by using the following relation(35)Vpikt+1=C4(Gbestikt−Ppikt)(i=1,2,…,N;i≠s;k=1,2,…,T)(36)Ppikt+1=Ppikt+Vpikt+1(i=1,2,…,N;i≠s;k=1,2,…,T)The updated velocity and position of a predator at (t+1) iteration/movements which represents hydro generating unit is calculated by using the following relation(37)Vpmkt+1=C4(Gbestmkt−Ppmkt)(m=N+1,N+2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T;k≠h)(38)Ppmkt+1=Ppmkt+Vpmkt+1(m=N+1,N+2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T;k≠h)whereGbestiktis the global best position of ith thermal unit at kth subinterval,Gbestmktis the global best position of mth unit at kth subinterval. C4 is the random number in the range [0,1] and it allows how fast predator catches the global best prey.The elements of predator position Ppik, Ppmkand velocity Vpik, Vpmkmay violate its limit. This violation is corrected by fixing their values either at lower or upper limits as given by Eqs. (41) and (42).The influence of the predator on prey is controlled by probability fear, Pf[28]. Pf is the probability of a particle changing its velocity due to presence of predator. If the predator influences the prey, then velocity equation of prey representing thermal generating units, changes to(39)Vikjt+1=wVikjt+C1r7(Pbestikjt−Pikjt)+C2r8(Gbestikt−Pikjt)+C3ae−bd(i=1,2,…,N;i≠s,k=1,2,…,T;j=1,2,…,NP)Similarly, velocity equation of prey representing hydro generating units changes if the predator influences the prey as(40)Vmkjt+1=wVmkjt+C1r9(Pbestmkjt−Pmkjt)+C2r10(Gbestmkt−Pmkjt)+C3ae−bd(m=N+1,N+2,…,NT;k=1,2,…,T;k≠h;j=1,2,…,NP)where d is Euclidean distance between predator and prey. Constant ‘a’ provides the maximum amplitude of the predator effect over a prey and ‘b’ allows controlling the effect. C3 is a random number in the range [0,1] and it influences the effect of predator on prey [28].The elements of prey position Pikjand velocity Vikjmay violate its limit. This violation is corrected by fixing their values either at lower or upper limits as described as:(41)Pikj=Pimin;Pikj<PiminPimax;Pikj>PimaxPikj;Pimin≤Pikj≤Pimax(42)Vikj=Vimin;Vikj<ViminVimax;Vikj>VimaxVikj;Vimin≤Vikj≤VimaxThis process is repeated for several iterations until the stopping criterion is met. In the present work stopping criterion is maximum number of iteration. Global best position will be the optimum generation schedule and corresponding generation cost is minimum cost of the scheduling problem.The present work has been implemented in the command line of FORTRAN-90 for the solution of hydrothermal scheduling. The program was run on 1.66GHz, Pentium-IV, with 512MB RAM PC. After a number of trials, values of PPO parameter such as maximum probability fear, maximum amplitude of the predator over a prey has set for best optimum solution. The proposed method has been applied to short-term hydrothermal scheduling problems considering two different cases these are:Case I: Short-term fixed-head hydrothermal scheduling problemSix test systems are undertaken to demonstrate the applicability of the method(I) Two generating units’ problem having one thermal and one hydro generating unit [32](II) Three generating units’ problem having one thermal and two hydro generating units [32](III) Four generating units’ problem having two thermal and two hydro generating units [16](IV) Four generating units’ problem having two thermal and two hydro generating units [14](V) Six generating units’ problem having four thermal and two hydro generating units [12](VI) Six generating units’ problem having four thermal and two hydro generating units [16]Case II: Short-term variable-head hydrothermal scheduling problemTo demonstrate the applicability of the method, two test systems are undertaken(I) Four generating units’ problem having two thermal and two hydro generating units [35](II) Nine generating units’ problem having five thermal and four hydro generating units [36]Case I: Short-term fixed-head hydrothermal problemThis case consider fixed-head short-term hydrothermal scheduling problem. To obtain the feasible solution for the scheduling period, scaling factor Wvand WDare set to 0.05 and 0.05, respectively. Maximum and minimum value of inertia weight has been set 0.9 and 0.4, respectively. Results are obtained by taking the swarm (prey) size as 50 and a single predator. All equality and inequality constraints are well satisfied. The optimum power generations among the generators for different test problems are presented in Tables 4–9. Losses are calculated using Kron's formula. The results of PPO technique are compared with various techniques like Evolutionary programming (EP) [12], simulated annealing (SA) [13], genetic algorithm multiplier updating (GA-MU), improved GA-MU (IGA-MU) [14], real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) [15], artificial immune system (AIS) [16], differential evolution (DE) [16], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [16] and efficient method (EM) [32]. For test system III to VI, it is clearly seen from Tables 1 and 2that the proposed method yields better results in terms of fuel cost than the results reported by various researchers. For test system I and II, optimal cost obtained by PPO is nearly same as obtained by efficient method. EM [32] approximated loss coefficient matrix to reduce the size of Jacobian matrix but in PPO based approach exact loss coefficients have been used. It can be observed from Tables 1 and 2, PPO based technique takes less time as compared to other existing evolutionary method to search optimum solution, so it is well suited for large power system scheduling problems.Case II: Short-term variable-head hydrothermal problemThis case considers short-term variable-head hydrothermal problem. PPO has been applied to two test systems. To obtain the feasible solution for the scheduling period, scaling factor Wvand WDare set to 0.001 and 0.002, respectively. Maximum and minimum value of inertia weight has been set 0.9 and 0.4, respectively. Results are obtained by taking prey swarm size as 60 in 100 iterations/movements. Thermal power, hydro power and losses for the given load of 24h duration are given in Table 10for first test system and Table 11depicts power generation and losses for second test system. Losses are calculated using Kron's formula. All equality and inequality constraint are satisfied. It is observed from Table 3, for first test system cost obtained by Rashid and Nor [35] is less than result achieved by PPO technique. But in Ref. [35] loss is considered only for first subinterval and in remaining all other subintervals generation meets only demand but does not includes transmission losses. In this paper generation meets demand and losses for all 24 subintervals. For second test system PPO algorithm yields better results than Dhillon et al. [36]. The values of PPO parameter for best solutions are given in Table 12. The value of scaling factor Wvand WDare normally set in the range of (0.001–0.05) to obtain the feasible solutions. An attempt has been made to find the dependency of convergence on PPO parameters. Set parameters have been varied by ±10%, considering one variation at a time, and corresponding variation in cost is shown in Fig. 1. Maximum and minimum percentage increase in cost as compared to optimum cost has been observed in case-I (test-III system) and case-I (test-I system), respectively. It is clearly seen from Fig. 1 that maximum and minimum increase in operating cost as compared to optimum value is nearly 0.818% and 0.08%, respectively. For other test systems, increase in cost lies between 0.08% and 0.818%. Convergence time is also observed with variation in set of parameters. It is concluded that CPU time to achieve convergence is approximately same as the time taken to achieve minimum operating cost in each case.Predator prey optimization based technique is applied to fixed and variable-head type hydrothermal power system. PPO technique has been successfully implemented to a hard nonlinear problem. Other Evolutionary methods are more susceptible to local minimum solutions as compared to PPO. One of the main deficiencies of standard PSO is that it faces difficulties to maintain balance between exploration and exploitation. In PPO, predator always moves toward the centre of mass of prey contained in the neighborhood and in nearest prey direction. When predator attacks on preys, they try to spread themselves in the field, in order to avoid casualties from a predator and try to move to best suited place. Predator effect helps to maintain diversity in the swarm to search around global best in a concentrated manner, whereas preys explore on a solution space roughly escaping from predator that helps to prevent premature convergence to local optima. Since optimal scheduling of a hydrothermal power system is a multimodal problem, so use of a PPO technique is well suited for this problem. Most of the evolutionary methods show slow convergence characteristics near to global minima, but PPO helps to overcome this problem due to predator effect. In PPO technique, predator always chases the prey that helps to speed up the conversion process. From numerical results it can be concluded that PPO is efficient in terms of minimization of thermal cost for both fixed and variable-head generation scheduling problem and takes very less time to achieve the solution. A heuristic search method is also proposed to create initial feasible solution to start the search which is not a cumbersome procedure. The search techniques easily work even if the objective function is non-convex, discontinuous and non-differential at some points.
