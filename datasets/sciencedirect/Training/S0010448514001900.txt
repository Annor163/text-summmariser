@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Given a finite set of pointsS⊆R2, we define a proximity graph called as shape-hull graph (SHG(S)) that contains all Gabriel edges and a few non-Gabriel edges of Delaunay triangulation ofS. For anyS,SHG(S)is topologically regular with its boundary (referred to as shape-hull (SH)) homeomorphic to a simple closed curve. We introduce the concept of divergent concavity for simple, closed, planar curves based on the alignment of curves in concave portions and discuss various measures to characterize curves having divergent concavity. Under sufficiently dense sampling, we prove thatSH(S), whereSis sampled from a divergent concave curveΣD, represents a piece-wise linear approximation ofΣD. We extend this result to provide a sculpting algorithm for closed surface reconstruction from a set of raw samples. The surface is constructed through a repeated elimination of Delaunay tetrahedra subjected to circumcenter and topological constraints. Theoretically, we justify our algorithm by establishing a topological guarantee on the 3D shape-hull with the help of topological rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with experimental results on models with sharp features and sparsely distributed point clouds. Compared to existing sculpting approaches for surface reconstruction that require either a parameter tuning or several stages, our approach is simple, non-parametric, single stage and reconstructs topologically correct piece-wise linear approximation for divergent concave surfaces.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Given a finite set of pointsS⊂R3, sampled from the surfacePof a real world object, the task of reconstructing a model ofPfromSis referred to as surface reconstruction problem. Recently, the problem has gained a lot of attention both in computer graphics and computational geometry, especially due to the proliferation of laser scanners and their wide applications in areas such as reverse engineering, product design  [1], cultural heritage  [2], and cartography  [3], among others. Apart from laser scanners, input point samples are also obtained from photogrammetry technique or mathematical functions. Different approaches have been taken to solve the problem depending upon the input data type or output reconstructed surface  [4]. Input data may be a registered point cloud equipped with or without normals and the reconstructed model may be a parametric or implicit surface or a triangulated surface mesh.Surface reconstruction is an ill-defined problem  [5] as there are several surfaces that might fulfill the topological and geometric properties of the original surface. Therefore, the main challenge for any surface reconstruction approach lies in mathematically defining a surface that best captures the geometric and topological properties of the original surface. It is well established that proximity information and neighborhood relationships of surface samples has a major role in defining the geometric shape of any surface. Aimed at an approach that exploits these two factors, we define a proximity graph called as shape-hull graph (SHG) which is essentially a restricted Delaunay graph that consists of Gabriel edges  [6] and a few non-Gabriel edges. The boundary ofSHG, referred to as shape-hull (SH), represents the polygonal reconstruction of a surface from its sample.In computational geometry, sculpting refers to the process of creating shapes or surfaces through a repeated elimination of tetrahedra from an initial tetrahedral mesh. We propose a sculpting algorithm for closed surface reconstruction based on three dimensional shape-hull graph, taking a registered point cloud without normals (this is referred to as raw point cloud data) as input and producing a triangulated surface mesh as output. The approach combines a local measure (circumradius) and a global information (largest circumradius). As a consequence, no user driven parameter tuning is required for the whole reconstruction process. We observe that non-parametric approach is a reasonable trade-off in many situations especially when considering that the parameter is critical to the output of many established algorithms and these algorithms provide only a limited guidance on selecting the optimal parameter. Moreover, we also provide a guarantee on the topologically correct reconstruction under the theoretical framework based on divergent concave curves,ϵ-sampling  [7] and topological rules.
