BackgroundThe report from the Institute of Medicine, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System in 1999 drew a special attention towards preventable medical errors and patient safety. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 and federal criteria of ‘Meaningful use’ stage 1 mandated e-prescribing to be used by eligible providers in order to access Medicaid and Medicare incentive payments. Inappropriate prescribing has been identified as a preventable cause of at least 20% of drug-related adverse events. A few studies reported system-related errors and have offered targeted recommendations on improving and enhancing e-prescribing system.ObjectiveThis study aims to enhance efficiency of the e-prescribing system by shortening the medication list, reducing the risk of inappropriate selection of medication, as well as in reducing the prescribing time of physicians.Method103.48 million prescriptions from Taiwan's national health insurance claim data were used to compute Diagnosis-Medication association. Furthermore, 100,000 prescriptions were randomly selected to develop a smart medication recommendation model by using association rules of data mining.Results and conclusionThe important contribution of this model is to introduce a new concept called Mean Prescription Rank (MPR) of prescriptions and Coverage Rate (CR) of prescriptions. A proactive medication list (PML) was computed using MPR and CR. With this model the medication drop-down menu is significantly shortened, thereby reducing medication selection errors and prescription times. The physicians will still select relevant medications even in the case of inappropriate (unintentional) selection.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Electronic Prescription (ePrescription, eRx) is one of the functionality/module of the computer-based order entry (CPOE) or electronic health record system (EHR) used by health providers for prescribing, transferring, dispensing and monitoring of the medications [1]. Barach et al., reports that nearly 100,000 individuals die per year in the U.S. due to preventable medical errors [2], and medication errors were found to be a major type of medical error [3]. The release of the Institute of Medicine report, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System in 1999 drew a special attention towards preventable medical errors and patient safety [4]. The advancement in the information technologies, particularly health information exchange within and among hospitals has been proven to significantly reduce medical errors and improve patient safety [5]. A decade later, under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 and federal criteria of ‘Meaningful use’ stage 1, e-prescribing was mandated to be used by eligible providers in order to access Medicaid and Medicare incentive payments [6,7].Reduced medication errors and improved patient safety have become the important indicators used for evaluating hospital performance and for approval of ‘meaningful use’ accreditations. Studies have reported more than an 80% of decrease in the medication errors in the in-patient settings with the use of ePrescription system [5,8,9]. Therefore, e-prescribing has been promoted as a potential information system in order to reduce medication errors and increase patient safety [8,10].Although on the one hand there are studies published that have evaluated the ePrescription system and reported the positive results [5,11,12], on the other hand there are studies revealing CPOE systems possess potential risk for 22 types of medication error [13] Up to 35% of prescribing errors were system-related (selection of an inappropriate (unintentional) drug from the drop-down menu next to a likely drug)[14]. Inappropriate prescribing has been identified as a preventable cause of at least 20% of drug-related adverse events [15,16]. A few studies reported system-related errors and have offered targeted recommendations on improving and enhancing e-prescribing system [17,18].Therefore, this study is aimed to enhance efficiency of the e-prescribing system by reducing the risk of inappropriate selection of the medication and also to reduce the prescribing time of the physicians. In order to do so we proposes a smart model that recommends most commonly prescribed medications in the drop-down menu for a given diseases.
