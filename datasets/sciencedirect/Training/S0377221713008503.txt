@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A game with precedence constraints is a TU game with restricted cooperation, where the set of feasible coalitions is a distributive lattice, hence generated by a partial order on the set of players. Its core may be unbounded, and the bounded core, which is the union of all bounded faces of the core, proves to be a useful solution concept in the framework of games with precedence constraints. Replacing the inequalities that define the core by equations for a collection of coalitions results in a face of the core. A collection of coalitions is called normal if its resulting face is bounded. The bounded core is the union of all faces corresponding to minimal normal collections. We show that two faces corresponding to distinct normal collections may be distinct. Moreover, we prove that for superadditive games and convex games only intersecting and nested minimal collection, respectively, are necessary. Finally, it is shown that the faces corresponding to pairwise distinct nested normal collections may be pairwise distinct, and we provide a means to generate all such collections.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In cooperative game theory, for a given set of players N, TU games are functionsv:2N→R, v(∅)=0, which express for each nonempty coalition S⊆N of players the best they can achieve by cooperation. In the classical setting, every coalition may form without any restriction, i.e., the domain of v is indeed 2N. In practice, this assumption is often unrealistic since some coalitions may not be feasible for various reasons, e.g., players may be political parties with divergent opinions or restricted communication abilities, or a hierarchy may exist among players and the formation of coalitions must respect the hierarchy, etc.Many studies have been done on games defined on specific subdomains of 2N, e.g., antimatroids (Algaba, Bilbao, van den Brink, & Jiménez-Losada, 2004), convex geometries (Bilbao, 1998; Bilbao, Lebrón, & Jiménez, 1999), distributive lattices (Faigle & Kern, 1992), or other structures (Béal, Rémila, & Solal, 2010; Faigle, Grabisch, & Heyne, 2010; Pulido & Sánchez-Soriano, 2006). In this paper, we focus on the case of distributive lattices. To this end, we assume that there exists some partial order ⪯ on N describing some hierarchy or precedence constraint among players, as in Faigle and Kern (1992). We say that a coalition S is feasible if the coalition contains all its subordinates, i.e., i∈S implies that any j⪯i belongs to S as well. Then by Birkhoff’s theorem, feasible coalitions form a distributive lattice.The main problem in cooperative game theory is to define a reasonable solution of the game, that is, supposing that the grand coalition N will form, how to share among its members the total worth v(N). The core (Gillies, 1959) is the most popular solution concept, since it ensures stability of the game in the sense that no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the grand coalition. For classical TU games, the core is either empty or a convex bounded polyhedron. However, for games whose cooperation is restricted, the study of the core is much more complex, since it may be unbounded or even contain no vertices (see a survey by Grabisch (2009)). For the case of games with precedence constraints, it is known that the core is always unbounded or empty but contains no line (i.e., it has vertices).Unboundedness of the core induces difficulties in using it as a solution concept because, on the practical side, one cannot handle payment vectors that grow beyond any border. Moreover, from the mathematical point of view, the core is not compact, and this property is often required for establishing results. For example, a sequence of elements in the core, created by some negotiation procedure, may not have a convergent subsequence, so that the procedure does not help to finally select an element of the core.Certainly there exist many ways of defining a compact subset of the core, e.g., one may take the convex hull of its vertices. Here, we choose another solution, called the bounded core (Grabisch & Sudhölter, 2012), which has a natural interpretation for games with precedence constraints. Indeed, the bounded core is the set of core elements such that every player takes the maximum of her direct subordinates, in the sense that any transfer from a subordinate to her boss would result in a payoff vector outside the core. Also, from a geometric point of view, the bounded core is the union of all bounded faces of the core.Besides, bounded faces of the core have been studied by Grabisch (2011) under the name restricted cores. Bounded faces arise by turning some inequalities x(S)⩾v(S) of the core into equalities, so that the resulting face does not contain any extremal ray. From a game theoretic point of view, these additional equalities can be seen as binding constraints for certain coalitions, and hence the arising face is named restricted core. If the collection of coalitions with a binding constraint does induce boundedness of the resulting face, it is called a normal collection. In Grabisch (2011), some examples of normal collections are provided, and their properties are studied.The aim of this paper is to investigate the structure of the bounded core with the help of normal collections. Specifically, we want to address the following combinatorial problem: The bounded core is the union of all bounded faces and, hence, it is the union of restricted cores with respect to all possible normal collections. However, the number of normal collections is huge, and we do not know any efficient way to generate them. Hence, the main question is: How can the bounded core be written as a union of a minimal number of faces? The second question naturally follows: How can the corresponding normal collections be generated?We provide complete answers to these questions for the case of convex games and answer the first question in the case of superadditive games as well as for the general case. We establish that for the general case only minimal (in the size of the collection) normal collections are necessary and, moreover, each minimal normal collection is necessary in the sense that for each minimal normal collectionN, there exists a game such that there is a point in the bounded face induced byN, which does not belong to any other bounded face (Proposition 6). In a similar result for superadditive games, we show that only intersecting minimal normal collections are needed (Proposition 7).For convex games Theorem 5 shows that only nested minimal normal collections are needed. In this case it is proved that generically all faces that correspond to the nested minimal normal collections are needed in the following sense: For any strictly convex game the face corresponding to an arbitrary nested minimal normal collection contains an element that is not contained in a face that corresponds to any other nested minimal normal collection. Finally, we show that nested minimal normal collections can be generated by a special class of linear extensions of the partial order ⪯ on N. Besides, we show a generalization of the well-known Shapley-Ichiishi theorem for games with precedence constraints.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 establishes the basic material for the rest of the paper, and it presents the notions of restricted core, normal collection and bounded core. Section 3 studies the set of normal collections, introduces properties and recalls and discusses well-known examples of minimal normal collections. It also shows how nested collections can be obtained by a closure operator on a certain class of normal collections. Section 4 investigates the general case and the case of superadditive games. It also generalizes the Bondareva-Shapley theorem (Bondareva, 1963; Shapley, 1971) by suitably generalizing the balancedness conditions that are equivalent to the nonemptiness of bounded faces of the core. Section 5 investigates in depth the case of convex games, showing the fundamental role played by minimal nested normal collections.Let (P, ⪯) be a finite partially ordered set (poset for short), that is, a finite set P endowed with a reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive relation (see, e.g., Davey & Priestley, 1990). We denote by ≺ the asymmetric part of ⪯. We say that x∈P covers y∈P, and we denote it by y≺·x if y≺x and there is no z∈P such that y≺z≺x.We denote by min(P) and max(P), respectively, the set of the minimal and maximal elements of (P, ⪯). The dual of the poset (P, ⪯), denoted by (P, ⪯∂) (or simply P∂), is the set P endowed with the reverse order, i.e., x⪯y if and only if y⪯∂x.Throughout the paper, it is understood that any subset Q of a poset (P, ⪯) is endowed with ⪯ restricted to Q (we do not use a special symbol for the restriction).A chain C is a subset of P such that its elements are pairwise comparable, i.e., for any two elements x, y∈C, we have x⪯y or y⪯x, whereas an antichain is a subset of pairwise incomparable elements of P. A chain C is maximal if no other chain contains it or, equivalently, if C={x1, …, xq}, with x1≺·x2≺·⋯≺·xqand x1∈min(P), xq∈max(P). Its length is q−1. The height of i∈P, denoted by h(i), is the length of a longest chain from a minimal element to i. Elements of same height k form level k, denoted by Lk. Hence, L0=min(P) is the set of all minimal elements, L1=min(P⧹L0), L2=min(P⧹(L0∪L1)), etc. The height of N, denoted by h(N), is the maximum of h(i) taken over all elements of N. Similarly, we define the depth d(i) of an element i∈N as its height in the dual poset P∂. We denote by D0 the set of all elements of depth 0, and we have that D0=max(P), D1=max(P⧹D0), D2=max(P⧹(D0∪D1)), etc.A lattice is a poset (L, ⪯), where for each x, y∈L their supremum x∨y and infimum x∧y exist. The lattice is distributive if ∨, ∧ obey distributivity.A subset Q⊆P is a downset of P if x∈Q and y⪯x implies y∈Q. We denote byO(P,⪯)the set of downsets of (P, ⪯). It is a well-known fact that(O(P,⪯),⊆)is a distributive lattice and every distributive lattice arises that way (Birkhoff, 1933). We denote by ↓x the downset generated by an element x∈P, that is, ↓x={y∈P∣y⪯x}. Similarly, for any Q⊆P, ↓Q=⋃x∈Q↓x.Let N be a finite set of n players. A set systemFon N is a collection of subsets of N containing N and ∅. Any nonempty subset inFis called a feasible coalition. We define a cooperative TU game with restricted cooperation (or simply a game) onFas the pair(F,v), withv:F→R, such that v(∅)=0.In this paper we focus on a particular case of set systems, introduced by Faigle and Kern (1992) (games with precedence constraints). We consider a partial order ⪯ on N, which may express precedence constraints among players, or hierarchical relations. A coalition S is feasible if whenever i∈S, all subordinates of i also belong to S, i.e., S is a downset of (N, ⪯). In other words,F=O(N,⪯), and henceF, partially ordered by inclusion, is a distributive lattice, where supremum and infimum are, respectively, ∪, ∩. In the sequel we often omit braces for singletons, writing, e.g., 1iinstead of 1{i}.A game(F,v)withF=O(N,⪯)is convex if(1)v(S∪T)+v(S∩T)⩾v(S)+v(T)forallS,T∈F.It is superadditive if the above inequalities are valid for disjoint sets S, T. It is strictly convex if the inequalities (1) are strict for S⧹T≠∅≠T⧹S.The following lemma extends a classical result whenF=2N.Lemma 1LetF=O(N,⪯)and(F,v)be a game. Then(F,v)is convex if and only if for all i∈N,(2)v(P∪i)-v(P)⩽v(Q∪i)-v(Q)forallP⫋Q⊆N⧹iwithP∪i,Q∈F,and it is strictly convex if for all i∈N all inequalities(2)are strict.In order to show that (1) implies (2), put S=P∪i and T=Q, and observe that S∩T=P and S∪T=Q∪i. For the other implication we may select i1, …, ip∈N, where p=∣S⧹T∣, such that(S∩T)∪{i1,…,im}∈Ffor all m=1, …, p−1 and S⧹T={i1, …, ip} (it suffices that ik⊀iℓ for k>ℓ). By (2),v(S)-v(S∩T)=∑m=1p(v((S∩T)∪{i1,…,im})-v((S∩T)∪{i1,…,im-1}))⩽∑m=1p(v(T∪{i1,…,im})-v(T∪{i1,…,im-1}))=v(S∪T)-v(T),where the last inequality is strict whenever the inequalities (2) are.□The core of a game(F,v)is defined as follows:C(F,v)={x∈Rn|x(S)⩾v(S)forallS∈F,andx(N)=v(N)},wherex(S)=∑i∈Sxi, with the convention x(∅)=0. By definition, it is a convex closed polyhedron. In the caseF=O(N,⪯), Derks and Gilles (1995) showed (as well as Tomizawa (1983), in a refined form) that it contains no line and found its rays – see also Fujishige (2005, Theorem 3.26). It is well known from the theory of polyhedra that the core can be written as the Minkowski sum of its convex part and its conic part:C(F,v)=conv(ext(C(F,v)))+C(F,0),where ext(·) and conv(·) denote the extreme points of some convex set and the convex hull of a set, respectively. Note that the conic part is obtained by replacing v by the zero function; hence the conic part depends solely onF.The characteristic function of S⊆N is denoted by 1S. WhenF=O(N,⪯), extremal rays of the core are generated by 1j−1ifor every i, j∈N such that j≺·i in (N, ⪯). Therefore, extremal rays correspond bijectively to edges in the Hasse diagram of (N, ⪯). Moreover, unlessF=2N, there is at least one extremal ray so thatC(F,0)is unbounded. Hence, we conclude that in the caseF≠2N,C(F,v)is either empty or unbounded.From the normative point of view, a closed but unbounded solution set to a game may be attacked on the grounds that a sequence of elements of this set, e.g., created by some negotiation procedure, may not have a convergent subsequence so that the procedure does not help to finally select an element of the set. Also, there is no “fair” chance move in the sense that there does not exist a uniformly distributed random variable on an unbounded core. However, there exists a compact subset of the core called the bounded core, (a) the definition of which has a plausible interpretation, and (b) which is characterized by some intuitive and simple properties (Grabisch & Sudhölter, 2012) that also characterize the core on the class of games with unrestricted cooperation (Hwang & Sudhölter, 2001). Indeed, the bounded coreCb(F,v)of(F,v)is the set of elements x ofC(F,v)that satisfy the following condition for any i, j∈N such that j≺·i: There is no ε>0 such thatx+ε(1i-1j)∈C(F,v). Hence, the bounded core is the set of core elements such that every player takes the maximum of her direct subordinates, in the sense that any transfer from a subordinate to her boss would result in a payoff vector outside the core. Also, the bounded core is the union of all bounded faces ofC(F,v),1Thus, the suitably normalized sum of the Lebesgue measures on those bounded faces that have maximal dimension may be regarded as uniform probability measure on a nonempty bounded core – see Dembski (1990) for the definition of uniform probability measures.1so that the convex part ofC(F,v)is the convex hull ofCb(F,v). If nonempty, it coincides with the core if and only ifF=2N. In this paper we investigate these bounded faces.In Grabisch (2011), some of the inequalities x(S)⩾v(S) are turned into equalities so that no extremal ray exists any more. These equalities can be considered as additional binding constraints on certain coalitions. We call normal collection any collectionN⊆F⧹{∅,N}such thatCN(F,v)={x∈Rn|x(S)⩾v(S)∀S∈F,x(S)=v(S)∀S∈N,andx(N)=v(N)}is bounded for all games(F,v)onF. Note thatNis normal if and only ifCN(F,0)={0}. It is remarked that the empty collection is normal if and only ifF=2N. We callCN(F,v)the restricted core with respect to (w.r.t.)N.We denote byNC(F)the set of normal collections onF. In Grabisch (2011), several normal collections are proposed (see Section 3). WhenF=O(N,⪯), it is proved that a normal collection contains at least h(N) sets, where h(N) is the height of (N, ⪯).We say that an extremal ray r ofC(F,0)is deleted by equality x(S)=0 ifC{S}(F,0)={x∈C(F,0)|x(S)=0}does not contain r any more. The following result from Grabisch (2011) is fundamental.Lemma 2LetF=O(N,⪯). For i, j∈N such that j≺·i, the extremal ray generated by 1j−1iis deleted by equality x(S)=0 if and only if S∋j and S∌i.Geometrically, a restricted coreCN(F,v), whenever nonempty, is a bounded face of the coreC(F,v)because it is bounded and defined by just turning some constraints that determine the core into binding constraints. The following result shows the relation between the two concepts (Grabisch & Sudhölter, 2012).Proposition 1LetF=O(N,⪯), and consider any game(F,v). ThenCb(F,v)=⋃N∈NC(F)CN(F,v).Let (N, ⪯) be a poset and considerF=O(N,⪯). In order to avoid pathologic cases we assume throughout this section that ≺≠∅, i.e., h(N)>0 or, equivalently,F⫋2N. We now define some possible properties of a normal collection.Definition 1ForT⊆Fdenoteg(T)=∑S∈T|S|. A normal collectionNis called minimal, short, or nested ifNdoes not contain a normal proper subcollection, if|N|=h(N), or ifNis a chain inF, respectively. Moreover, we say that a normal collectionNis thinner than a normal collectionN′ifg(N)<g(N′)and there exists an injectionι:N→N′such that S⊆ι(S) for allS∈N. The normal collection is thinnest if there is no thinner normal collection.LetNandN′be normal collections. ThenNis thinner thanN′if and only ift=g(N′)-g(N)>0and there exist normal collectionsN=N0,…,Nt=N′such thatNjis thinner thanNj+1for all j=0, …, t−1.The “if-part” is an immediate consequence of the transitivity of the relation thinner. In order to show the “only-if-part” we proceed by induction on t. If t=1, then this part is valid by the definition of thinner. We assume now that the statement is shown for all 1⩽t<r for some r>1. If t=r, let ι satisfy the properties of Definition 1. Two cases may occur.|N|<|N′|: In this case select anyS′∈N′⧹ι(N), i∈min(S′) and defineN″=N∪{{i}}. AsN″containsN, it is still normal. Moreover,Nis thinner thanN″,N″is thinner thanN′, andg(N″)=g(N)+1so that, by the inductive hypothesis, the proof is complete.|N|=|N′|: In this caseA={S∈N|S⫋ι(S)}≠∅. LetS0∈Asuch that α=min{h(i)∣i∈ι(S0)⧹S0}⩽min{h(i)∣ i∈ι(S)⧹S} for allS∈Aand let i∈ι(S0)⧹S0 with h(i)=α. ThenT=S0∪{i}∈F. DefineN″=(N⧹{S0})∪{T}. As S⊆T⊆ι(S0) andg(N″)=g(N)+1, it remains to show thatN″is normal. Let j∈N such that j≺·i. It suffices to prove that there existsS″∈N″with i∉S″∋j. LetS′∈N′with i∉S′∋j and denote S=ι−1(S′). IfS∉A, then S=ι(S)=S′. IfS∈A, then j∈S because h(j)<h(i). In any case we have i∉S∋j and S≠S0. Hence,S″=S∈N″.□By Proposition 2, a normal collection is thinnest if and only if none of its members may be deleted or replaced by a proper subset without losing normality. Hence, a thinnest normal collection is minimal, but the converse may not be true (see Example 3). Moreover, note that any short normal collection is minimal, but the converse is not true (see Example 5).We give some elementary properties of normal collections.Lemma 3LetN={N1,…,Nq}, N1⫋⋯⫋Nq, be a nested normal collection, and denote N0=∅ and Nq+1=N. Then Nk⧹Nk−1is an antichain in (N, ⪯) for k=1, …, q+1.If Nk⧹Nk−1 is not an antichain, then there exist i, j∈Nk⧹Nk−1 such that i≺·j. SinceNis nested, no set inNwill contain i and not j. Then by Lemma 2, the ray 1i−1jis not deleted by an equation of the form x(S)=0 where S∈N.□Suppose thatNis a collection containing a set S such thatN⧹S∈F. IfNis normal, thenN⧹{S}is normal.If there were an elementS∈Nsuch thatN⧹S∈F, then the condition x(S)=0 would not eliminate any extremal ray because j∈S and j≺·i would imply i∈S. Therefore, S can be discarded fromN.□LetNbe a normal collection that contains two disjoint sets P and Q with P∪Q≠N. IfN′=(N⧹{P,Q})∪{P∪Q}, thenN′is a normal collection, andCN(F,v)⊆CN′(F,v)for every superadditive game(F,v).AsF=O(N,⪯),P∪Q∈F. Let i, j∈N such that j≺·i. If j∈P∌i, then i∉Q becauseQ∈O(N,⪯)and P∩Q=∅. Similarly, if j∈Q∌i, then i∉P. Hence,N′is still normal by Lemma 2. Now, letx∈CN(F,v). Then x(T)=v(T) for allT∈N′⧹{P∪Q}, x(S)⩾v(S) for allS∈F⧹N′, x(N)=v(N), x(P)=v(P), and x(Q)=v(Q), x(P∪Q)⩾v(P∪Q)⩾v(P)+v(Q), where the last inequality is valid by superadditivity. Hence, x(P∪Q)=v(P∪Q), so thatx∈CN′(F,v).□We now provide some examples of special short normal collections discussed in the literature. The upwards normal collectionNuis built from the successive removal of minimal elements, the downwards normal collectionNdis built from the successive removal of maximal elements, and the collectionNGXmay be seen as a dual ofNd. Formally, these collections are defined by (for the definitions of h(N), Lk, Dk, etc., see Section 2)Nu={N1u,…,Nh(N)u},Nd=N1d,…,Nh(N)d,andNGX=N1GX,…,Nh(N)GX,where for every k=1, …, h(N),Nku=↓(Lk-1⧹max(N)),Nkd=Dk∪⋯∪Dh(N),andNkGX=L0∪⋯∪Lk-1.Clearly,NdandNGXare nested normal collections. Moreover, Grabisch (2011) shows thatNuis thinnest, and Grabisch and Xie (2011) verify thatNGXis a “thickest” short normal collection, i.e.,NGXis not thinner than any other short normal collection. For the sake of completeness we now verify thatNdis also thinnest.Proposition 3The downwards normal collection is thinnest.ConsiderNℓd=Dℓ∪⋯∪Dh(N)for some 1⩽ℓ⩽h(N), and remove an element k from it which is maximal in this set (if not, one cannot remove it sinceNℓd⧹{k}would not be a downset). Note that k∈Dℓ. Then there exists an element j such that k≺·j. Therefore, the ray 1k−1jis not deleted byNℓd⧹{k}. Since k∈Dℓ, it follows thatk∉Nℓ+1d, so that ray 1k−1jremains.□Consider the poset (N, ⩾) of 9 elements, the Hasse diagram of which is depicted below.We have L0={1, 2, 3}, L1={4, 5, 6, 9}, L2={7, 8}, and D0={7, 8, 9}, D1={2, 4, 5, 6}, D2={1, 3}. The upwards collection is {123, 13456}, the downwards collection is {123456, 13}, andNGX={123,1234569}(where it is understood that 123 is a shorthand for {1, 2, 3}, etc.).We now show that the upwards normal collection and many other normal collections, though not necessarily nested themselves (see the foregoing example), may generate nested normal collections. In general, letNbe a normal collection. An ordering ofNis a bijectionσ:N→{1,…,|N|}. For every ordering σ defineNσ={⋃i=1kσ-1(i)|k=1,…,|N|}, called the nested closure ofNat σ. We call σ feasible if(3)σ-1(k)⧹⋃ℓ=1k-1σ-1(ℓ)isanantichainof(N,⪯)forallk=1,…,|N|.Example 2(Example 1 continued) Consider the normal collectionN={136,134,125}. ThenNhas no feasible ordering because none of its elements is an antichain.The nested closure of a normal collection at an ordering is normal if and only if the ordering is feasible.Consider a normal collectionN, an ordering σ ofN, and letNσ={N‾1,…,N‾q}its nested closure, i.e.,N‾k=⋃i=1kσ-1(i).Suppose thatNσis not normal. Then there exists a ray 1i−1jwith i≺·j, which is not deleted byNσ, i.e., any set inN‾j,j=1,…,q, either contains both i and j or none of them. SinceN‾σis nested, there exists some k∈{1, …, q} such thatN‾1,…,N‾kcontain neither i nor j, andN‾k+1,…,N‾qcontain both i and j. Therefore, inN, σ−1(1), …, σ−1(k) contain neither i nor j, while σ−1(k+1) contains them both. Since i≺·j, this contradicts (3) and, hence, σ is not a feasible ordering.Conversely, suppose that σ is not feasible forN. Then there exist i, j∈N with i≺j, and k∈{1, …, q} such that σ−1(k) contains both i, j, while the sets σ−1(k−1), …, σ−1(1) contain none of them. Then,N‾k⧹N‾k-1is not an antichain, and by Lemma 3, we conclude thatNσis not normal.□The nested closure of the upwards normal collectionNuat the ordering σ given byσNku=kfor k=1, …, h(N) is denoted byNW={N1W,…,Nh(N)W}, and it is called the Weber collection (Grabisch, 2011). We haveNkW=⋃ℓ=1kNℓu=⋃j=0k-1Lj⧹max(N)fork=1,…,h(N),so that, by Theorem 1,NWis normal. The Weber collection is also short and therefore minimal.Proposition 4For the upwards collection the ordering σ defined byσNku=k, for k=1, …, h(N), is the unique feasible ordering.Only uniqueness has to be shown. Let τ≠σ be an ordering and k be minimal such thatτ-1(k)≠Nku, sayτ-1(k)=Nℓufor some ℓ>k. Choose i0∈Lℓ−1⧹max(N). Then there exists j∈Lℓ−2 such that j≺·io. It follows thati0,j∈τ-1(k)⧹⋃i=1k-1τ-1(i)so thatNτis not normal by Theorem 1.□Moreover, as⋃j=0kLj⊇Dh(N)-kfor all k=0, …, h(N), we conclude thatNh(N)+1-kd=⋃ℓ=h(N)+1-kh(N)Dℓ⊆⋃j=0k-1Lj⧹max(N)=NkWforallk=1,…,h(N),so that we have deduced the following relations withNGXandNd.Proposition 5The normal collectionNdeither coincides with or is thinner than the normal collectionNW, andNWeither coincides with or is thinner than the normal collectionNGX.By means of Example 3 it is shown that Weber collection may neither coincide with the downwards normal collection nor with the collectionNGX.Example 3(Example 1 continued) The Weber collection is {123,123456}, and hence the downwards collection is thinner than the Weber collection that is thinner than the collectionNGX.The “opposite” construction of a nested closure is that of the “opening”. For any nested normal collectionN={N1,…,Nq}, N1⫋⋯⫋Nq, define its opening byN∘={N1,↓(N2⧹N1),…,↓(Nq⧹(N1∪⋯∪Nq-1))}.Corollary 1The opening of a nested normal collection is normal, and every nested normal collection is a nested closure of its opening.Throughout this section we assume that (N, ⪯) is a poset and thatF=O(N,⪯). LetNbe a normal collection and(F,v)a game. WhetherCN(F,v)is empty or not depends on both the normal collection and the game. It may happen thatCN(F,v)is empty whileC(F,v)is not. IfCN(F,v)is nonempty, then it is a bounded face ofC(F,v). Moreover, ifN⊆N′∈F, thenCN′(F,v)⊆CN(F,v)so that, by Proposition 1,(4)Cb(F,v)=⋃N∈MNC(F)CN(F,v),whereMNC(F)denotes the set of minimal normal collections onF. Regardless of the game v it cannot be expected that all the setsCN(F,v)are pairwise distinct as shown by means of Example 4.Example 4Let N={1, 2, 3} and (N, ⪯) be given by 1≺2, 3. There are two minimal normal collections, namelyN1={1}andN2={12,13}. Moreover,CN1(F,v)≠∅if and only if v(12)+v(13)⩽v(1)+v(N), andCN2(F,v)≠∅if and only if v(12)+v(13)⩾v(1)+v(N). In the case that v(12)+v(13)=v(1)+v(N),CN1(F,v)=CN2(F,v)is the singleton {(v(1), v(12)−v(1), v(13)−v(1))}. Hence, in any case eitherCb(F,v)=CN1(F,v)orCb(F,v)=CN2(F,v).Nevertheless, all setsCN(F,v)are needed in Eq. (4) in the following sense.Proposition 6For eachN0∈MNC(F)there exists a game(F,v)such thatCb(F,v)⧹⋃N∈MNC(F)⧹{N0}CN(F,v)≠∅.Let v be defined by v(S)=0 for allS∈N0∪{N,∅}and v(T)=−1 for allT∈F⧹(N0∪{∅,N}). Then0∈RNbelongs toCN0(F,v)and, hence, toCb(F,v), but not toCN(F,v)for any other minimal normal collectionN.□For superadditive games not all minimal normal collections may be needed in Eq. (4). Recall that a collection of sets is called intersecting if any two of its sets have a nonempty intersection, and letIMNC(F)denote the set of intersecting minimal normal collections. By Lemmas 4 and 5 we obtain that(5)Cb(F,v)=⋃N∈IMNC(F)CN(F,v)foranysuperadditivegame(F,v).Again Example 4 shows that not all of the restricted cores w.r.t. intersecting minimal normal collections may be distinct even in the superadditive case, but Proposition 6 has the following analogue.Proposition 7For eachN0∈IMNC(F)there exists a superadditive game(F,v)such thatCb(F,v)⧹⋃N∈IMNC(F)⧹{N0}CN(F,v)≠∅.The proof of Proposition 7 is similar to the proof of Proposition 6. Indeed, ifN0is intersecting, then the constructed game v is automatically superadditive so that the proof can be literally copied.We now provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the nonemptiness of the restricted core w.r.t. a normal collection that generalizes the balancedness condition of the Bondareva-Shapley theorem (Bondareva, 1963; Shapley, 1971). For a normal collectionNwe say thatB⊆FisN-balanced if there exist δS>0,S∈B, such that∑S∈BδS1S=∑S∈N∪{N}1S. We call(δS)S∈Ba system ofN-balancing weights.Theorem 2LetNbe a normal collection.CN(F,v)≠∅if and only if for everyN-balanced collectionBwithN-balancing weights(δS)S∈B, it holds that(6)∑S∈BδSv(S)⩽∑S∈N∪{N}v(S).We consider the following linear program withx∈RN:minz=∑S∈N∪{N}x(S)s.t.x(S)⩾v(S),S∈FThe optimal value z∗ of z is∑S∈N∪{N}v(S)if and only ifCN(F,v)≠∅. The dual problem readsmaxw=∑S∈FδSv(S)s.t.∑S∈FδS1S=∑S∈N∪{N}1SδS⩾0,S∈F.By the duality theorem, w∗=z∗, which implies that any feasible solution satisfies∑S∈FδSv(S)⩽∑S∈N∪{N}v(S).□LetNbe a normal collection. Theorem 2 may be reformulated as follows:CN(F,v)≠∅if and only if for all vectorsy∈RFwith y≠0 satisfying∑S∋i,S∈FyS=0,i∈NyS⩾0,S∈F⧹(N∪{N}),it holds that∑S∈FySv(S)⩽0.By multiplying all ySby a sufficiently small positive real if necessary, we may additionally assume that yS⩾−1 for allS∈F. If we extend a system(δS)S∈BofN-balancing weights to all elements ofFby defining δS=0 for allS∈F⧹B, then the desired equivalence is established by assigning, to anyS∈F,yS=δS,ifS∈F⧹(N∪{N}),-δS,ifS∈N∪{N}.We remark that the foregoing equivalent version of Theorem 2 may also be proved by directly applying Farkas lemma (see, e.g., Schrijver, 1986).It should be noted that at an element x ofCN(F,v)every coalitionS∈Nis effective for x, i.e., x(S)=v(S). An exact game (Schmeidler, 1972) is defined by the requirement that every coalition is effective for some core element. Though these concepts are quite distinct, the interested reader may compare our concept ofN-balancedness with the properties like “exact balancedness” and “overbalancedness” that are used to characterize exact games with unrestricted cooperation (Schmeidler, 1972; Csóka, Herings, & Kóczy, 2011).Also note that Theorem 2 generalizes a result of Grabisch and Xie (2011). As it can be observed, the proof follows the classical scheme, where terms with N as argument, like v(N), x(N), are replaced by summations of these terms overN∪{N}. Therefore, a strong form of the theorem can be obtained as well, which we give without proof.We say that a collectionB⊆Fis minimalN-balanced ifBisN-balanced and no proper subcollection isN-balanced. Similarly to the classical case, we obtain that a minimalN-balanced collection has a unique system ofN-balancing weights, and we get the following result.Theorem 3LetNbe a normal collection.CN(F,v)≠∅if and only if(6)holds for any minimalN-balanced collectionB, where(δS)S∈Bis the unique system ofN-balancing weights forB.It should be noted that if (N, ⪯) is connected (that is, for any i, j∈N, there is a sequence of elements i=i1, i2, …, ik=j such that iℓ and iℓ+1 are comparable, for ℓ=1, …, k−1), then the coreC(F,v)is nonempty for any game v (Grabisch & Sudhölter, 2012, Lemma 3.2). SinceC(F,v)contains no line, the bounded core, too, is nonempty, implying that in this case there exists at least one nonempty restricted core for any game v.Throughout this section we assume that (N, ⪯) is a poset and thatF=O(N,⪯).The following result has been shown by Grabisch (2011).Proposition 8Suppose that(F,v)is a convex game. Then, for any nested normal collectionN, the restricted coreCN(F,v)is nonempty.The next result shows that, moreover, the union of the restricted cores w.r.t. nested normal collections already coincides with the bounded core provided that the game is convex. The main result of this section (Theorem 5) shows the converse of Proposition 8 for strictly convex games.Proposition 9For any normal collectionN, there exists a nested normal collectionN′such that, for any convex game v,CN(F,v)⊆CN′(F,v).The proof is based on the following technical lemma. For any collection∅≠G⊆Fwe defineF(G)={(G⧹{T,T′})∪{T∩T′,T∪T′}|T,T′∈G}.Note that any element ofF(G)is nonempty and does not possess a larger cardinality thanGand thatG∈F(G).Lemma 6Withg=|G|, theg(g-1)2-fold composition of F applied toG, i.e.,Fg(g-1)2(G), contains a nested collection.We proceed by induction on g. If g=1, thenGis already nested. Assume that the lemma is valid for any g<k for some k>1. Now, if g=k, then letG={T1,…,Tg}, defineT1′=⋃j=1gTj,Tk′=Tk∩⋃j=1k-1Tkfor k=2, …, g and letG′=T1′,…,Tg′. Note thatG′∈Fg-1(G)and that2⩽g′=|G′|⩽g. By the inductive hypothesis,F(g′-1)(g′-2)2G′⧹T1′contains a nested collectionG″. By construction, all elements ofG″are contained inT1′. Hence,G″∪T1′is a nested collection inFg-1+(g′-1)(g′-2)2(G)⊆Fg(g-1)2(G).□(of Proposition 9) We may assume thatN≠∅. LetT,T′∈Nand v be a convex game. In view of Lemma 6 it suffices to show thatN′=(N⧹{T,T′})∪{T∪T′,T∩T′}is (a) normal and (b)CN(F,v)⊆CN′(F,v). In view of Lemma 2 and by interchanging the roles of T and T′ if necessary, in order to show (a) it suffices to prove that, for any i, j∈N such that i∈T∌j and i≺·j either j∉T′ or i∈T′. Now, if j∈T′, then i∈T′ because T′ is a downset. In order to show (b) letx∈CN(F,v). In order to show thatx∈CN′(F,v)it suffices to show that x(T∪T′)=v(T∪T′) and x(T∩T′)=v(T∩T′). As the game is convex,v(T∪T′)+v(T∩T′)⩽x(T∪T′)+x(T∩T′)=x(T)+x(T′)=v(T)+v(T′)⩽v(T∪T′)+v(T∩T′)so that the desired equalities follow immediately.□We recall the notion of marginal vector and restricted marginal vector introduced by Grabisch (2011). To this end we assume throughout that N={1, …, n}. We consider the set of maximal chains inF. This set is in a one-to-one correspondence with the setL(⪯)of linear extensions of (N, ⪯), i.e., to any maximal chain C={∅, S1, S2, …, Sn}, ∅≠S1⫋⋯⫋Sn=N, corresponds a unique permutation π on N with Si≔{π(1), …, π(i)}, i=1, …, n, and vice versa. The linear extension is given by the sequence π(1), π(2), …, π(n). Considering a game(F,v), the marginal vectoraπ(v)∈RNassociated to the linear extension π (equivalently, aC(v) associated to the maximal chain C) is the payoff vector defined by(7)aπ(i)π(v)≔v(Si)-v(Si-1)=v({π(1),…,π(i)})-v({π(1),…,π(i-1)}),i∈N.Consider a nested collectionG(not necessarily normal). A restricted maximal chain w.r.t.Gis a maximal chain (from ∅ to N) inFcontainingG. Associated linear extensions are called restricted linear extensions, and the set of restricted linear extensions w.r.t.Gis denoted byLG(⪯). A restricted marginal vector is a marginal vector whose underlying maximal chain is restricted.The following result is noteworthy and extends the classical result of Shapley (1971) and Ichiishi (1981).2This result is in fact already known. It has been proved for acyclic permission structures by Derks and Gilles (1995), while it is known from Algaba et al. (2004) that these set systems are equivalent to set systems of the formO(N,⪯). Also, Grabisch and Xie (2008) proved it in an unpublished paper. The “only-if-part” is known from Fujishige and Tomizawa (1983) (also cited in Theorem 3.22 of Fujishige (2005)). We provide a simpler proof of this result, thereby also making the current paper more self-contained.2Theorem 4A game(F,v)is convex if and only ifaπ(v)∈C(F,v)for everyπ∈L(⪯).Necessity: Assume that v is convex, letS∈F⧹{∅}, andπ∈L(⪯). We have to show that(8)∑i∈Saiπ(v)⩾v(S).Let i1, …, is∈S, s=∣S∣, be chosen so that π−1(i1)<⋯<π−1(is). ThenTk={i1,…,ik}=Sπ-1(ik)∩S∈Ffor any k=1, …, s, using the above notation. By (2),v(Sπ-1(ik))-v(Sπ-1(ik)⧹ik)⩾v(Tk)-v(Tk-1)forallk=1,…,s,where T0=∅. Summing up all these inequalities yields (8).Sufficiency: Let v be a game and assume thataπ(v)∈C(F,v)for allπ∈L(⪯). LetS,T∈Fso that S⧹T≠∅≠T⧹S. Let S∩T={i1, …, ir}, T⧹S={ir+1, …, it}, S⧹T={it+1, …, iq}, and N⧹(S∪T)={iq+1, …, in} such that, for any j∈N,{i1,…,ij}∈F. Then the permutation π defined by π(j)=ijfor any j∈N is a linear extension. Hence,v(S)⩽∑i∈Saiπ(v)=∑i∈S(v(Sπ-1(i))-v(Sπ-1(i)⧹i))=∑j=1r(v({i1,…,ij})-v({i1,…,ij-1}))+∑j=t+1q(v(T∪{it+1,…,ij})-v(T∪{it+1,…,ij-1}))=v(S∩T)+v(S∪T)-v(T),so that the proof is complete.□In Grabisch (2011)Theorems 4 and 5, it is proved that for any nested normal collectionN, the set of restricted marginal vectors is the set of extreme points ofCN(F,v)if v is convex.Proposition 10For any nested normal collectionNofFand any convex game v,{aπ(v)|π∈LN(⪯)}is the set of extreme points ofCN(F,v).An inspection of the proof shows that the result extends to any nested, not necessarily normal, collection. Also, the foregoing results have the following immediate consequence.Corollary 2A game(F,v)is convex if and only if{aπ(v)|π∈L(⪯)}is the set of extreme points ofC(F,v).The “if-part” is a special case of the “if-part” of Theorem 4. Now, if v is convex, then, by Propositions 9 and 10, every vertex ofC(F,v)is a marginal vector and every marginal vector belongs toC(F,v). Since, by (7),∑j=1iaπ(j)π(v)=v({π(1),…,π(i)})for i=1, …, n, a marginal vector aπ(v) is a vertex ofC(F,v)whenever it belongs toC(F,v).□We are now in a position to show the main result of this section. LetMNNC(F)denote the set of minimal nested normal collections ofF.Theorem 5(i)For any convex game v and any nested normal collectionNofF,CN(F,v)≠∅. Moreover, if v is strictly convex, thendimCN(F,v)=n-|N|-1.For any convex game v,Cb(F,v)=⋃N∈MNNC(F)CN(F,v).Moreover, no term in the union is redundant if v is strictly convex.LetNbe a normal collection ofF. If v is strictly convex, thenCN(F,v)≠∅if and only ifNis nested.(i)The first assertion is Proposition 8. By Proposition 10, for anyπ∈LN(⪯),aπ(v)∈CN(F,v). Letx=1|LN(⪯)|∑π∈LN(⪯)aπ(v). If v is strictly convex, then in order to show the equation it suffices to prove that x(S)>v(S) for allS∈F⧹(N∪{∅,N}). LetN∪{∅,N}={T0,…,Tr}, where ∅=T0≠T1⫋⋯⫋Tr=N. Suppose there exists j∈{1, …, r−1} such that Tj⧹S≠∅≠S⧹Tj, thenv(S)+v(Tj)<v(S∩Tj)+v(S∪Tj)⩽x(S∩Tj)+x(S∪Tj)=x(S)+x(Tj)=x(S)+v(Tj)by strict convexity and becausex∈CN(F,v). Otherwise, there exists ℓ∈{0, …, r−1} such that Tℓ⫋S⫋Tℓ+1. Let S′=Tℓ∪(Tℓ+1⧹S). Note that since Tℓ+1⧹Tℓ is an antichain by Lemma 3,S′∈F. Then there existsπ̃∈LN(⪯)such thatS′={π̃(1),…,π̃(|S′|)}, i.e.,∑i∈S′aiπ̃(v)=v(S′). By strict convexity we conclude that∑i∈Saiπ̃(v)>v(S). For anyπ∈LN(⪯),∑i∈Saiπ(v)⩾v(S)and, hence, x(S)>v(S).The equation follows from Propositions 1 and 9, and the fact that minimal normal collections give largest restricted cores. In order to show the final statement, let v be strictly convex and let x be defined as in the proof of (i). We have seen that x(S)=v(S) if and only ifS∈N∪{∅,N}so that there is no other minimal normal collectionN′withx∈CN′(F,v).One direction follows from (i). For the other direction letNbe a normal collection that is not nested. Hence, there areS,T∈Nsuch that S⧹T≠∅≠T⧹ S. By strict convexity, v(S)+v(T)<v(S∪T)+v(S∩T) so that anyy∈RNwith y(S)=v(S) and y(T)=v(T) either satisfies y(S∩T)<v(S∩T) or y(S∪T)<v(S∪T). We conclude thatCN(F,v)=∅.□It remains to find all nested minimal normal collections. For this, the following lemma is useful.Lemma 7The nested normal collectionN={N1,…,Nq}, ∅≠N1⫋⋯⫋Nq, is minimal if and only if(i)Nq⧹Nq−1contains an element that is not maximal (w.r.t. ⪯), andNk⧹Nk−1contains an element i that covers some element j (i.e., j≺·i) of Nk−1⧹Nk−2for k=2, …, q, where N0=∅.If (i) is not satisfied, thenN⧹{Nq}is still normal, and if (ii) is not satisfied for some k, thenN⧹{Nk-1}is still normal. In order to verify the opposite implication assume thatNis not minimal and let p∈{1, …, q} such thatN⧹{Np}is still normal. If p=q, thenNviolates (i), and if p<q, thenNviolates (ii) for k=p+1.□Everyπ∈L(⪯)generates a collectionNπ⊆Fdefined as follows: Let 0=t0<t1<⋯<tq<tq+1=n be defined by the requirements that•{π(tj+1), …, π(tj+1)} is an antichain for all j=0, …, q;{π(tj+1), …, π(tj+1+1)} is not an antichain for all j=0, …, q−1.Then define Nj={π(1), …, π(tj)} for all j=1, …, q and putNπ={N1,…,Nq}. As Nj⧹ Nj−1 for j=1, …, q is an antichain (where N0=∅),Nπis a nested normal collection. Moreover,Nπis a minimal normal collection by Lemma 7. Conversely, letN={N1,…,Nq},N1⫋⋯⫋Nq, be a minimal nested normal collection. Chooseπ∈L(⪯)such that•for all j=1, …, q, π−1(Nj)={1, …, ∣Nj∣};π(∣Nk−1∣+1) covers some element of Nk−1⧹ Nk−2 for all k=2, …, q.By Lemma 7 such π exists. By constructionN=Nπ.We summarize that every linear extension3Linear extensions, also known as topological sorting, can be generated in linear time in the number of linear extensions; see, e.g., Pruesse and Ruskey (1994). However, the problem of counting all linear extensions of a finite partial order is #P-complete; see Brightwell and Winkler (1991).3of (N, ⪯), i.e., everyF-admissible ordering of N, generates a unique minimal nested normal collection ofFand that a minimal nested normal collection is generated by some (not necessarily unique) linear extension of (N, ⪯).Example 5Let N={1, 2, 3, 4} and ⪯ be determined by 1≺3 and 2≺4. Then minimal nested normal collections areN1={12},N2={1,123},andN3={2,124}.Note thatN2andN3, although minimal, are not short. TheF-admissible permutations areπ1=(1,2,3,4),π2=(1,2,4,3),π3=(2,1,3,4),π4=(2,1,4,3),π5=(1,3,2,4),andπ6=(2,4,1,3).The permutations π1, …, π4 generateN1, π5 generatesN2, and π6 generatesN3. However, for any convex game v,CN1(F,v)=conv({aπ1(v),…,aπ4(v)}),CN2(F,v)=conv({aπ1(v),aπ5(v)}),andCN3(F,v)=conv({aπ4(v),aπ6(v)}).Finally, if v(S)=∣S∣2 forS∈F, then v is strictly convex andaπ5(v)+aπ6(v)2=(3,3,5,5)∉Cb(F,v)so that the bounded core may be nonconvex even for convex games.The nested collectionsNd,NGX,NWpresented in Section 3 are generated by particular linear extensions. Let π be a permutation of N. Then π is a linear extension that generates the normal collection•Ndif and only if it satisfiesπ⋃j=k+1h(N)Dj+i∈Dkforallk=1,…,h(N)andalli=1,…,|Dk|;NGXif and only if it satisfiesπ⋃j=0k-1Lj+i∈Lkforallk=0,…,h(N)-1andalli=1,…,|Lk|;NWif and only if it satisfiesπ⋃j=0k-1Lj⧹max(N)+i∈Lk⧹max(N)fork=0,…,h(N)-1,i=1,…,|Lk⧹max(N)|.
