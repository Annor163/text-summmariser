@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Mechanisms, defined as assemblies of dimensioned rigid bodies linked by ideal joints, can be partitioned in three mobility states: the rigid state (where bodies can have only one position relative to each other), the mobile state (where bodies can move relatively to each other) and the impossible state (where bodies dimensions and specified joints cannot lead to a feasible assembly). It is also clear that although bodies dimensions can vary in a continuous way, assemblies may experience quite abrupt changes across those states. This paper proposes a new approach to this problem with the goal of being able to predict the mobility class of an assembly of arbitrary complexity, and how it can be affected by a perturbation of the dimensions of its bodies. It does so by proposing a simple and general state transition framework including the three above defined states and seven transitions describing how a dimensional perturbation can affect them. Using this framework, the mobility of a mechanism is easier to capture and predict, using only dimensional (u) and positional (p) parameters involved in an appropriate equation (F(u,p)=0). This is achieved by focusing on howF()behaves whenuandpget perturbed, and the impact of this reaction on the mobility state of the assembly. As a result of this more mathematic approach to the problem, previously used notions of iso-constraint, over-constraint and paradoxical assembly, traditionally used to describe such assemblies, can be rigorously defined and thus clarified.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
We are interested in designing and manufacturing physical mechanisms and understanding their properties in a formal setting. Variations in design can be obtained by perturbing dimensions, but this has an effect on the resulting mobility of the mechanism. Therefore, starting from an initial state, the point is to converge to a final design with the same mobility. Furthermore, a physical mechanism can never be manufactured at nominal dimensions. The point is also to understand how dimensional uncertainty can influence the properties of factory-made mechanisms.The goal of this paper is to simplify definitions and investigation of properties of mechanisms. The focus is put on rigidity and mobility, which are widely studied  [1–5]. The concept of mechanism used in this theory is very general since only basic semantic is involved. Dimensional parameters notedudefine the dimensions of rigid bodies. They are set by the designer as input values of the equation. Positional parameters notedpdefine relative positions of rigid bodies. They are the unknowns of the equation. Constraints, joints, links, etc. complete the system by mixinguandpparameters into an equationF(u,p)=0. Only general properties of the equation are used. How rigid bodies and constraints are involved is not detailed, provided it results in aF(u,p)=0type equation where functionFfeatures the appropriate smoothness. The theory proposed in this paper is valid whether group theory, graph theory, Cartesian or non Cartesian, relative or absolute modeling  [3,6–14] is used to set up the equation.The behavioral principle is to deliberately ignore the formulation of the equation and to focus on how functionFbehaves under parameters perturbations. Given(u0,p0)a couple of dimensional and positional parameters defining a mechanical assembly, meaning thatF(u0,p0)=0, the question is to completely figure out what can happen whenu0and/orp0is perturbed. Does the assembly still exist? If yes, is rigidity or mobility saved or lost?To reach this goal, the first step is to define states of the assembly. An assembly can be either “rigid”, “mobile” or “impossible”. States definitions are inspired by considering the positional parameter under a fixed dimensional parameter. The second step is to define all transitions from one state to another, postulating that the cause of a transition is a dimensional perturbation. In other words, can an assembly switch from any state to any other state, is there any sink state? It is well known that mechanism design must cope with non generic situations  [1,2,15–20]. This is the reason why the present paper thoroughly investigates the nature and the effect of dimensional perturbations.The landscape being dressed through the states and transitions, sufficient conditions on functionFare investigated in order to understand how differential properties are related to behaviors. Surprisingly, it is proven that some transitions are never possible due to smoothness and invariance properties of functionF. Furthermore, it is proven that some transitions are not accessible under first order condition: second order conditions must be investigated. These concepts are compared to traditional definitions like iso-constrained, over-constrained, paradoxical, thus bringing precision and clarification. Each situation is illustrated by an actual mechanism: either a planar rigid bars arrangement, or a crankshaft.Section  2 recalls the classical Kutzbach–Grubler mobility index, as it is mentioned all through the paper for comparison. Section  3 compares the present approach with combinatorial rigidity. Section  4 defines the notion of mechanism at the appropriate level of abstraction. Section  5 provides mathematical definitions of the states. Section  6 defines and illustrates all possible transitions from one state to another. The important result is related to transitions from the “impossible” state. Section  7 exhaustively investigates sufficient conditions for state and transitions based on first order differential properties of functionF. It also provides a track for second order analysis through bifurcation theory. After the state transition approach is set, Section  8 provides comparison with traditional notions. Section  9 exemplifies the analysis on the very classical crankshaft mechanism. Depending on the nature of the crank–rod joint, this mechanism exhibits the most interesting features presented in the theoretical sections. Finally, Section  10 concludes just before the mathematical theorems and lemmas of the Appendix.Existing formula to compute the mobility index (also named the number of degrees of freedom) of a mechanism is known as the Kutzbach–Grubler criterion, as thoroughly investigated in  [2] and references therein. Consider a mechanism involvingnbbodies throughnjjoints. Letnbe the sum of degrees of freedom of joints, each one considered independently. Then, the Kutzbach–Grubler criterion computes the so called mobility indexδof the mechanism by(1)δ=n−g(nj−nb+1)wheregis a constant number depending on the nature of the mechanism. In fact,gis the number of degrees of freedom of an unconstrained arbitrary body. Planar and spherical mechanisms requireg=3. 3D mechanisms requireg=6. The mobility index is advantageously computed by using a graph includingnbnodes, respectively associated with rigid bodies, andnjarcs, respectively associated with joints. Each arc is labeled with the joint’s degrees of freedom, meaning thatnis the sum of all labels. This graph is illustrated each time in the following. It is proven in  [2] that (1) is questionable in many practical situations, and the connection with the present work is interesting.The purpose of this section is to compare the present approach with the combinatorial rigidity theory  [3–5]. The reader who is not familiar with this theory can skip this section. Combinatorial rigidity investigates structures made of rigid bars connected at their end points by spherical joints. The combinatorial aspect is the logical graph underlying the structure: bars are modeled by edges and joints are modeled by vertices. The theory provides criteria for generic rigidity of such structures.The first drawback is that it handles spherical joints only, while many other kinds of joint are needed in mechanical design: cylindrical, prismatic, revolute, coplanar, etc. Mechanism of Figs. 6, 8 and 18 involve prismatic joints. Assembly of Figs. 10 and 14 could be modeled by a graph made of rigid bars connected at their end points, but this would artificially increase complexity and dimensioning.The second drawback is that combinatorial rigidity does not explicitly deal with dimensional parameters. Variables of the edge function and its derivative, the rigidity matrix (the key feature of the theory) are vertices coordinates of the graph structure. The theory is not suited to investigate dimensional parameters influence. Indeed, combinatorial rigidity handles genericity from the vertices coordinates points of view, which makes a big difference with the present approach. For example, assemblies of Figs. 2 and 4 are generically rigid form the combinatorial theory point of view: any small perturbation of vertices (joints) coordinates yields an assembly of the same nature. From the mechanical designer point of view, the situation is totally different. Any small perturbation of bars lengths of assembly in Fig. 2 yields an assembly of the same nature. It is generic in this sense. Conversely, there exists arbitrary small perturbations of bars lengths of assembly in Fig. 4 that makes it impossible. It is not generic in this sense. Bars lengths are not independent, they must fit a special relationship, as investigated by Proposition 3. This makes a fundamental difference from the manufacturing point of view.The concept of abstract mechanism is set up to deal with any kind of mechanism, while saving the semantic of dimensional vs. positional parameters. It should be understood as an abstract way to model any mechanism. In the following, symbolsUandPrepresent parameters spaces. For sake of generality, these spaces should be manifolds and used with local maps to finite dimensional euclidean spaces. Nevertheless, for simplicity and since local analysis is performed all through the paper, parameters spaces are defined as finite dimensional spaces. The only exception is Proposition 1 where the nature of spacesUandPis particularly considered.Definition 1An abstract mechanism is a four-tupleM=(U,P,E,F)whereU=Rnis the space of dimensional parameters,P=Rmis the space of positional parameters,E=RkandF:U×P→Eis a smooth function.FunctionFcaptures the nature of the mechanism. It involves dimensional and positional parameters according to rigid bodies and joints. FunctionFis supposed to be twice continuously differentiable despite it is generally analytic. Furthermore, the derivative ofFwith respect to all its variables is supposed to be full rank. The equation of the mechanism is thenF(u,p)=0, which is a shortcut to deal withkscalar equations.Definition 2An assembly of the abstract mechanismMis a couple(u,p)∈U×Psuch thatF(u,p)=0. The set of all assemblies is notedZ={(u,p)∈U×P,F(u,p)=0}.Definition 2 makes the connection with the classical notion of workspace. This concept, which is very popular in robotics  [21], is used to describe the space of feasible positions of mobile mechanisms, and it can be connected to the present work. Indeed, given(u,p)∈Z, the subset ofPdefined byZ(u)={p∈P,(u,p)∈Z}is the workspace defined byu. Clearly, workspaceZ(u)depends on the choice of a dimensional parameteru. According to this wording, our goal is to investigate the (local) nature of setZ(u)under changes ofu.The concept of state is mainly driven by rigidity and mobility of assemblies. Nevertheless, an “impossible” state is necessary in order to complete the landscape. As opposed to usual definitions  [1,2] the following ones are based on the behavior of functionF. If functionFis analytic, the following definitions are the only possibilities.Definition 3An assembly(u0,p0)is rigid ifp0is an isolated zero of the partial functionp↦F(u0,p). In other words, there existsε>0such that if|p−p0|<εandF(u0,p)=0thenp=p0.This definition is behavioral in the sense that it does not say how functionFisolates parameterp0. It just says that, given the dimensional parameteru0, the positional parameterp0is the only possible solution in the neighborhood. Properties of functionFinsuring this behavior are investigated through sufficient conditions in further section.From the vocabulary point of view, “flexible” is widely used as well and means the same as “mobile”. For clarity, a single word is selected, which is “mobile”.Definition 4An assembly(u0,p0)is mobile if there existsε>0and a smooth functionp:]−ε,ε[→Pof a scalar variabletsuch thatp(0)=p0,p′(0)≠0andF(u0,p(t))=0for allt∈]−ε,ε[.Conditionp′(0)≠0insures that the arct↦p(t)does not degenerate into a unique point, meaning that the positional parameterpactually changes in such a way that the components of the mechanism actually move with respect to one another. By definition, functionpis smooth if its first derivativep′is continuous. Consequently, the definition is equivalent to:p′(t)≠0for allt∈]−ε,ε[, possibly by choosing a smallerε>0.Furthermore, the definition does not say that the arcp=p(t)is unique. This includes situations where a continuum of arcs exists, which occurs when the assembly features more than one degree of freedom. The definition includes as well bifurcation situations typically featuring two arcs crossing at pointp0.Here again, the question of how functionFfits the definition will be investigated later.Definitions 2–4 state that an assembly is such thatF=0. Rigorously, the word “assembly” may not be reused to define a situation whereF≠0. For this reason and for clarity, the word “configuration” is preferred in Definition 5.Definition 5An impossible configuration is a dimensional parameteru0such that the partial functionp↦F(u0,p)has no zero.Previous section defines three states for an assembly or configuration of a mechanism. This concept of state deals with the behavior of the positional parameterpunder a given and fixed dimensional parameteru0. Conversely, the concept of transition deals with the question: how a perturbation of the dimensional parameter can change the state of an assembly or a configuration? For example, given a mobile assembly(u0,p0), does a perturbationu0+usave mobility, or does it make the assembly rigid, or does it change the assembly into an impossible configuration?It is important, at this point of the investigation, to make precise the nature of the dimensional perturbation. The dimensional perturbation is “small” in the following sense. Let(u0,p0)be a rigid (resp. mobile) assembly. The first situation is the following: there existsε>0such that for any dimensional perturbationũ∈Usuch that|u0−ũ|<ε, there exists a positional parameterp̃∈Psuch thatF(ũ,p̃)=0and such that(ũ,p̃)is still a rigid (resp. mobile) assembly. In other words, the nature of the initial state is saved under any dimensional perturbation, provided it is small enough.Next situation is the negation of the previous one. Mathematically, this means that for allε>0there existsuεsuch that|u0−uε|<εand either nop∈Pexists such thatF(uε,p)=0or there existspε∈Psuch thatF(uε,pε)=0and such that(uε,pε)is a mobile (resp. rigid) assembly. In short, it is possible to change the state of the initial assembly through an arbitrary small perturbation of its dimensional parameter. By choosing successivelyε=1nwheren=1,2,3,…, this means that either the initial rigid (resp. mobile) assembly(u0,p0)is the limit of a sequence(un,pn)n>0of mobile (resp. rigid) assemblies or that the initial dimensional parameteru0is the limit of a sequence(un)n>0of impossible configurations.The very last situation is an impossible configurationu0that would be the limit of a sequence(un)n>0such that(un,pn)n>0is a sequence of rigid (resp. mobile) assemblies. But it is proven in the following that this situation is not possible.The benefit of the approach is that, since there are only three states, there exists, a priori, nine transitions. Indeed, considering the graph in Fig. 1where states are nodes and transitions are directed arcs, at most nine arcs join three nodes, including arcs connecting a node to itself. This section investigates each transition and provides, in each case, either an assembly example or a proof that the transition is not possible. Assembly examples are made simple enough to be understood by intuition. Of course, they can be resolved by hand or by using existing theories  [3–5] but the goal is to exemplify the transitions, not to solve elementary situations. Until the end of Section  6,(εi)iis a sequence of positive numbers converging to zero, typicallyεi=10−(i+1).Let(u0,p0)be a rigid assembly of mechanismM=(U,P,E,F), meaning thatF(u0,p0)=0and thatp0is an isolated solution of equationF(u0,p)=0. A rigid-to-rigid transition occurs when exists an arbitrary small perturbationũof dimensional parameteru0together with a positional parameterp̃such thatF(ũ,p̃)=0andp̃is again an isolated solution of equationF(ũ,p)=0.Typical example is the following planar five rigid articulated bars system (Fig. 2). Leta,b,c,d,ebe the positive lengths of each bar. The sequence of barsa,b,canddis a close loop such that the length of one bar is strictly smaller than the sum of all three others:a+b+c>dfor instance. Bareis a diagonal bar connecting joint between barsaandbwith joint between barscandd. Intuitively, this system is rigid and it is obvious that any small dimensional perturbation results in another five bars rigid system. Even more, there is no way to change this assembly into an impossible configuration through a small dimensional perturbation.Graph of Fig. 3captures joints and bodies relationships of mechanism in Fig. 2. Arcs are labeled with joints degrees of freedom. Formula (1) states thatδ=n−g(nj−nb+1)=6−3(6−5+1)=0meaning rigidity, which is compliant with the expected behavior.Let(u0,p0)be a rigid assembly of mechanismM=(U,P,E,F), meaning thatF(u0,p0)=0and thatp0is an isolated solution of equationF(u0,p)=0. A rigid-to-impossible transition occurs when exists an arbitrary small perturbationũof dimensional parameteru0so that equationF(ũ,p)=0has no solution. An example (Fig. 4) of such a system is provided by adding a second diagonal bar to the previous planar five bars rigid system. Letfbe the length of this additional bar. Starting with the rigid five bars assembly and adding barfyield another rigid system. This six bars assembly can feature the rigid-to-impossible transition by perturbing lengthfasfi=(1+εi)f, all other lengths being unchanged. Clearly,fi→fasi→+∞and for alli, there exists no six bars assembly defined by lengthsa,b,c,d,e,fi.Graph of Fig. 5captures joints and bodies relationships of mechanism in Fig. 4. Arcs are labeled with joints degrees of freedom. Formula (1) states thatδ=n−g(nj−nb+1)=8−3(8−6+1)=−1meaning overconstrained rigidity, which is compliant with the expected behavior.Let(u0,p0)be a mobile assembly of mechanismM=(U,P,E,F), meaning thatF(u0,p0)=0and thatt↦p(t)is a non degenerated arc such thatp(0)=p0andF(u0,p(t))=0for allt. A mobile-to-mobile transition occurs when exists an arbitrary small perturbationũof dimensional parameteru0together with a non degenerated arct↦p̃(t)such thatF(ũ,p̃(t))=0for allt.A typical example (Fig. 6) is a planar crankshaft where the dimensional parameters are the crank length isa≠0and the rod length isb≠0. It is intuitively obvious that any small perturbation ofaandbyields another mobile crankshaft.Graph of Fig. 7captures joints and bodies relationships of mechanism in Fig. 6. Arcs are labeled with joints degrees of freedom. Formula (1) states thatδ=n−g(nj−nb+1)=4−3(4−4+1)=1meaning mobility, which is compliant with the expected behavior.Let(u0,p0)be a mobile assembly of mechanismM=(U,P,E,F), meaning thatF(u0,p0)=0and thatt↦p(t)is a non degenerated arc such thatp(0)=p0andF(u0,p(t))=0for allt. A mobile-to-impossible transition occurs when exists an arbitrary small perturbationũof dimensional parameteru0so that equationF(ũ,p)=0has no solution. The example (Fig. 8) is made of twoL-shape bodiesLα,Lβand a T-shape bodyT. They are connected by three prismatic joints. Dimensional parameters are anglesα,βand lengthb>0. The assembly can be mounted if and only ifα+β=πand it is mobile. Clearly, perturbing angleβintoβi=π−(1−εi)αyields a sequence of impossible configurations converging to the mobile assembly.The mobility index fails to describe this situation. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. 9, there arenb=3bodies connected bynj=3prismatic joints. Each joint, considered independently, features 1 degree of freedom. Furthermore,g=3since the mechanism is planar. So, (1) states thatδ=n−g(nj−nb+1)=1+1+1−3(3−3+1)=0meaning rigidity ….Let(u0,p0)be a mobile assembly of mechanismM=(U,P,E,F), meaning thatF(u0,p0)=0and thatt↦p(t)is a non degenerated arc such thatp(0)=p0andF(u0,p(t))=0for allt. A mobile-to-rigid transition occurs when exists an arbitrary small perturbationũof dimensional parameteru0together with a positional parameterp̃such thatF(ũ,p̃)=0andp̃is an isolated solution of equationF(ũ,p)=0. The example is built on a planar four bars articulated assembly (Fig. 10). Notinga,b,c,dthe positive lengths of the consecutive bars such thata+b+c>d, the mobile polygon is changed into a mobile parallelogram by settingc=aandd=b. A fifth bar is added from the middle point of barbto the middle point of bardthrough rotoid joints. Of course, the lengtheof this additional bar is sete=a. Clearly, mobility of the initial parallelogram is saved by the additional bar so that the resulting planar five bars assembly is still mobile.The mobile-to-rigid transition is obtained as follows. First, the assembly in positioned in a rectangular shape. Then, lengthcis perturbed intoci=(1+εi)a, lengtheis perturbed intoei=(1+εi2)aand lengthbis perturbed intobi=b2+εi2a2. This yields a rigid assembly for alli. In other words, an arbitrary small perturbation changes the initial mobile assembly into a rigid assembly.The mobility index fails to describe this situation. Indeed, as illustrated in Fig. 11, there arenb=5bodies connected bynj=6joints. Each joint, considered independently, features one degree of freedom. So, (1) states thatδ=n−g(nj−nb+1)=6−3(6−5+1)=0meaning rigidity.Let(u0,p0)be a rigid assembly of mechanismM=(U,P,E,F), meaning thatF(u0,p0)=0and thatp=p0is an isolated solution of equationF(u0,p)=0. A rigid-to-mobile transition occurs when exists an arbitrary small perturbationũof dimensional parameteru0together with a non degenerated arct↦p̃(t)such thatF(ũ,p̃(t))=0for allt. The example is built on a degenerated four articulated bars assembly. Notinga,b,canddthe positive lengths of consecutive bars, supposea+b+c=d. These length values stretch the linkage so that all bars are collinear. The assembly is now rigid. Clearly, keeping lengthsa,b, andcconstant and perturbing lengthdintodi=(1−εi)drestores mobility sincea+b+c>difor alli. This changes the assembly of Fig. 12(illustration from  [2]) into a four bars mobile assembly. Consequently, an arbitrary small perturbation changes the initial rigid assembly into a mobile assembly. The mobility index fails to describe this situation. Its value is the one of the mobile four bars, that isδ=n−g(nj−nb+1)=4−3(4−4+1)=1.The impossible state features a particular property. It is proven here that once an assembly is in the impossible state, there is no chance to escape from it through an arbitrary small dimensional perturbation. This is subtle. It means that a mounted assembly can be the limit of a sequence of impossible configurations but the reverse is not true: an impossible configuration cannot be the limit of a sequence of mounted assemblies. In some way, the collection of impossible configurations is an open set. This is based on general properties of mechanical assemblies captured by functionFand detailed hereafter.By nature, dimensional and positional parameters are lengths and angles. NotingS1the unit circle, this means that they can be writtenu=(l,θ)andp=(x,α)wherel∈Rn1,θ∈(S1)n2,x∈Rm1,α∈(S1)m2,m=m1+m2,n=n1+n2. In other words, angle parameters can be writtenθ=(θ1,…,θn2)andα=(α1,…,αm2). Similarly, length parameters can be writtenl=(l1,…,ln1)andx=(x1,…,xm1). Furthermore,F(l,θ+2k1π,x,α+2k2π)=F(l,θ,x,α)for all anglesθ,αand all integersk1,k2.By nature again, a mechanism is “the same” modulo a positive length scaling. This means that if(l0,θ0,x0,α0)is an assembly, that isF(l0,θ0,x0,α0)=0then, for any real numberλ>0,F(λl0,θ0,λx0,α0)=0.Thanks to continuity of functionFand taking the limitλ→0+, the solutionl0=0,x0=0always exists, despite it represents a totally collapsed mechanism. Clearly, the collapsed solution(0,θ0,0,α0)and the family of proportional solutions(λl0,θ0,λx0,α0),λ>0have no added value when investigating the properties of the mechanism. The following normalization(l0|l0|,θ0,x0|l0|,α0)advantageously eliminates these spurious solutions. Thus, normalizing the dimensional length is to define the positional length space as theRn1unit sphere, notedSn1−1, so that the dimensional parameters space becomes(2)U=Sn1−1×(S1)n2.Finally, a mechanism is bounded in the following sense. Given(l,θ,x,α)such thatF(l,θ,x,α)=0, and fixing the dimensional lengthl, positional lengthxcannot be arbitrary large. Formally, two constant numbersa,bmust exist such that(3)F(l,θ,x,α)=0⇒|x|≤a|l|+b.It is now possible to establish the impossible state property.Proposition 1GivenM=(U,P,E,F)an abstract mechanism, letZ={(u,p)∈U×P,F(u,p)=0}be the set of all assemblies and letZU={u∈U,(u,p)∈Z}be the projection ofZontoU. Then, the setI=U−ZUof impossible configurations is an open subset ofU.ProofThanks to (2) and (3), there exists a compact setKofRm1such that the set of positional parametersprealizingF(u,p)=0for someuis included inK×(S1)m2. So, the positional parameters spacePcan be writtenP=K×(S1)m2, which is a compact set. Consequently, the Cartesian productU×Pis a compact set as well. By continuity of functionF, setZis a closed subset of the compactU×P, soZis a compact set. By continuity of the projection mapping, setZUis a compact set as well. Finally, setI=U−ZUis a relative open subset ofU.□As illustrated in Fig. 13, the actual state transition graph includes seven transitions instead of nine since impossible-to-rigid and impossible-to-mobile transitions are not relevant.In order to fully understand Proposition 1, let us have a look at functionF(u,p)=up−1. Dimensional and positional parameter spaces are respectivelyU=RandP=R. Given a dimensional parameteru, the corresponding positional parameter given byF(u,p)=0isp=u−1. So, the set of impossible configurations is reduced to{u=0}, which is not an open subset ofR. This is because functionFdoes not feature the proportionality0=F(u,p)=F(λu,λp)for allλ>0, and therefore, cannot model a mechanism.This section systematically investigates situations where a partial derivative of functionFis invertible. Transversality  [22] could be used in Propositions 2–4. Nevertheless, an elementary and systematic approach is preferred in order to deal with generic and non generic situations by using the same tools. It will be seen that transition capabilities are closely related to the nature of the invertible partial derivative. Each theorem is illustrated with an example.The situation discussed in this subsection is generic: there is no assembly condition, the assembly still exists under any small dimensional perturbation. The hypothesis about the invertible partial derivative implies that the numberkof scalar equations is the same as the numbermof positional parameters.Proposition 2LetM=(U,P,E,F)be an abstract mechanism and let(u0,p0)be an assembly ofM. Suppose that the partial derivativeFp(u0,p0)is an invertible linear mapping. Then, the assembly(u0,p0)is rigid and features rigid-to-rigid transitions only.ProofApplying implicit function theorem toFat(u0,p0)yields a unique local functionu↦p(u)defined in the neighborhoodV0ofu0such thatp(u0)=p0andF(u,p(u))=0for allu∈V0. Thanks to Lemma 1 applied with arcu↦(u,p(u)), positional parameterp0is an isolated solution of equationF(u0,p)=0, meaning that the assembly(u0,p0)is rigid. Any dimensional perturbationũ∈V0defines a unique positional parameterp̃=p(ũ)such that(ũ,p̃)has the same properties as(u0,p0). This means that the assembly(u0,p0)only features rigid-to-rigid transitions.□Proposition 2 is now illustrated by using mechanism of Fig. 2. Notingαthe angle between barsdanda, and notingβthe angle between barsdandc, functionF:U×P→EisF(a,b,c,d,e,α,β)=12(c2−b2+e2−2accos(α−β)+2cdcosβa2+d2−e2−2adcosα)withu=(a,b,c,d,e)so thatdimU=5,p=(α,β)so thatdimP=2anddimE=2. Values of dimensional and positional parameters as they appear in Fig. 2 are respectively noteda0,b0,c0,d0,e0andα0,β0. The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to positional parametersα,βis as follows.F(α,β)=(acsin(α−β)−acsin(α−β)−cdsinβadsinα0).Furthermore,det(F(α,β))=acdsinα(asin(α−β)+dsinβ)vanishes when barseandcare collinear. This is not the situation of Fig. 2, soF(α,β)is invertible at(a0,c0,d0,α0,β0). The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to dimensional parametersa,b,c,d,eisF(a,b,c,d,e)=(Fa,Fb,Fc,Fd,Fe)withFa=(ccos(α−β)a−dcosα)Fb=(−b0)Fc=(c−acos(α−β)+dcosβ0)andFd=(cosβd−acosα)Fe=(e−e).Proposition 2 states the existence (and unicity) of local mappings(a,b,c,d,e)↦α(a,b,c,d,e)(a,b,c,d,e)↦β(a,b,c,d,e)such thatα(a0,b0,c0,d0,e0)=α0β(a0,b0,c0,d0,e0)=β0andF(a,b,c,d,e,α(a,b,c,d,e),β(a,b,c,d,e))=0for all(a,b,c,d,e)in a neighborhood of(a0,b0,c0,d0,e0). These mappings are the solution of differential equation(4)(α′β′)=−(F(α,β))−1F(a,b,c,d,e).Notationα′is a short cut to replace the vector of partial derivativesα′=(αa,αb,αc,αd,αe).Same forβ′.In the situation discussed in this subsection, an assembly condition comes out as a sub product of implicit function theorem. The hypothesis about the invertible partial derivative implies that the numberkof scalar equations is larger than the numbermof positional parameters,k>m, and that the numbernof dimensional parameters is such thatn+m≥k.Proposition 3LetM=(U,P,E,F)be an abstract mechanism and let(u0,p0)be an assembly ofM. The variableuis split intou=(v,w)so that the argument of functionFis notedF(v,w,p)and so that(v0,w0)=u0. Suppose that the partial derivativeF(w,p)(v0,w0,p0)is an invertible linear mapping. Then, the assembly(u0,p0)is rigid and features rigid-to-rigid transitions and rigid-to-impossible transitions. The assembly cannot feature a rigid-to-mobile transition.ProofApplying implicit function theorem toFat(v0,w0,p0)yields two unique local functionsv↦φ(v)andv↦p(v)defined in the neighborhoodV0ofv0such thatφ(v0)=w0,p(v0)=p0andF(v,φ(v),p(v))=0for allv∈V0. Thanks to Lemma 1 applied with arcv↦(v,φ(v),p(v)), parameterp0is an isolated solution of equationF(v0,w0,p)=0, meaning that the assembly(u0,p0)is rigid. Rigid-to-rigid transitions are obtained by perturbing dimensional parameteru0intoũ=(ṽ,φ(ṽ))whereṽis a small perturbation ofv0. Rigid-to-impossible transitions are obtained as follows. Lemma 1 applied to functionv↦(v,φ(v),p(v))proves that(w0,p0)is an isolated solution of equationF(v0,w,p)=0. Then, applying Lemma 2 to function(w,p)↦F(v0,w,p)at(w0,p0)provides a sequenceun=(v0,wn)of impossible configurations. A rigid-to-mobile transition is out of reach because, in the neighborhood of(v0,w0,p0), the unique solution is given byv↦(v,φ(v),p(v)). This means that the only way to set the dimensional parameter isu=(v,φ(v))which in turn sets a unique positional parameterp(v).□Mappingv↦φ(v)is the local expression of the assembly condition. It means that the dimensional parameteruis not totally free. It must be compliant with theu=(v,φ(v))format, meaning that only dimensional parametervcan be freely chosen. A rigid-to-impossible transition is caused by perturbing dimensional parameteruout of this format.By the way, displaying or plotting the geometry of mappingv↦φ(v)in thev,wspace is of great interest to the mechanical designer. This is a way to understand the mutual influence of dimensional parameters while hiding the role of positional parameters. The choice to separateuinto independent dimensional parametersvand dependent dimensional parameterswis not unique. Each one is a new highlight on dimensional parameters dependency.Proposition 3 is now illustrated by using mechanism of drawing (A) in Fig. 4. Notingαthe angle between barsdanda, and notingβthe angle between barsdandc, functionF:U×P→EisF(a,b,c,d,e,f,α,β)=12(e2−b2−d2+f2−2accos(α−β)a2+d2−e2−2adcosαc2+d2−f2+2cdcosβ)withu=(a,b,c,d,e,f)so thatdimU=6,p=(α,β)so thatdimP=2anddimE=3. Values of dimensional and positional parameters as they appear in drawing (A) of Fig. 4 are respectively noteda0,b0,c0,d0,e0,f0andα0,β0. Back to notations of Proposition 3, independent dimensional parameters arev=(a,b,c,d,e)and dependent dimensional parameter isw=f. The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to dimensional parameterfand to positional parametersα,βis as follows.F(f,α,β)=(facsin(α−β)−acsin(α−β)0adsinα0−f0−cdsinβ).Furthermore,det(F(f,α,β))=acdfsinα(asin(α−β)+dsinβ)vanishes when barseandcare collinear. This is not the situation of Fig. 4, soF(f,α,β)is invertible at(a0,c0,d0,f0,α0,β0). The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to dimensional parametersa,b,c,d,eisF(a,b,c,d,e)=(Fa,Fb,Fc,Fd,Fe)withFa=(ccos(α−β)a−dcosα0)Fb=(−b00)Fc=(−acos(α−β)0c+dcosβ)andFd=(−dd−acosαd+ccosβ)Fe=(e−e0).Proposition 3 states the existence (and unicity) of local mappings(a,b,c,d,e)↦f(a,b,c,d,e)(a,b,c,d,e)↦α(a,b,c,d,e)(a,b,c,d,e)↦β(a,b,c,d,e)such thatf(a0,b0,c0,d0,e0)=f0α(a0,b0,c0,d0,e0)=α0β(a0,b0,c0,d0,e0)=β0andF(a,b,c,d,e,f(a,b,c,d,e),α(a,b,c,d,e),β(a,b,c,d,e))=0for all(a,b,c,d,e)in a neighborhood of(a0,b0,c0,d0,e0). These mappings are the solution of differential equation(5)(f′α′β′)=−(F(f,α,β))−1F(a,b,c,d,e).Notationf′is a short cut to replace the vector of partial derivativesf′=(fa,fb,fc,fd,fe).Same forα′andβ′.A practical implementation is to keep one dimensional parameter as a variable and to fix all the others. This way, unknown mappingsf(⋅),α(⋅)andβ(⋅)involve only one scalar variable and differential equation (5) turns out to be an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and can be solved by standard numerical integration. For example, fixing parametersa,b,c,eat their initial values and keeping parameterdas the variable defines partial mappingsd↦f(a0,b0,c0,d,e0)d↦α(a0,b0,c0,d,e0)d↦β(a0,b0,c0,d,e0)solutions of the ODE(6)(f′α′β′)=−(F(f,α,β)(a0,c0,d,f,α,β))−1F(a,b,c,d,e)(a0,b0,c0,d,e0,α,β)wheref′is the derivation of mappingfwith respect to scalar variabled. Same forα′andβ′. As a byproduct of (6), the curved↦f(a0,b0,c0,d,e0)discloses the influence of dimensional parameterdon dimensional parameterfwhen all other dimensional parameters are fixed. This is a theoretical and numerical way to investigate the assembly condition.Any other combination is solved the same way by fixing and unfixing dimensional parameters of interest. For example, the influence of parameteraon parameterbis computed by solving ODE like(b′α′β′)=−(F(b,α,β))−1F(a,c,d,e,f)which yields mappinga↦b(a).The situation discussed in this subsection is generic again. Existence and mobility of the assembly are saved under any small dimensional perturbations. Hypothesis about the invertible partial derivative implies that the numberkof scalar equations is lower than the numbermof positional parameters. The particular casem=k+1is detailed in the following in order to deal with one degree of freedom, and it can be extended easily.Proposition 4LetM=(U,P,E,F)be an abstract mechanism and let(u0,p0)be an assembly ofM. The variablepis split intop=(r,t)wheretis a scalar variable. The argument of functionFis notedF(u,r,t)and(r0,t0)=p0. Suppose that the partial derivativeFr(u0,r0,t0)is an invertible linear mapping. Then, the assembly(u0,p0)is mobile and features mobile-to-mobile transitions only.ProofApplying implicit function theorem toFat(u0,r0,t0)yields a unique local function(u,t)↦r(u,t)defined in the neighborhoodV0of(u0,t0)such thatr(u0,t0)=r0andF(u,r(u,t),t)=0for all(u,t)∈V0. Mobility is provided by the arct↦p(t)=(r(u0,t),t)because|p′(t)|2=|rt(u0,t)|2+1>0. This mobility behavior is saved under any small dimensional perturbation. Indeed, choosing an arbitrary(ũ,t̃)∈V0yields another unique arct↦p̃(t)=(r(ũ,t),t)defined in the neighborhood oft̃.□Proposition 4 is now illustrated with a planar crankshaft mechanism (Fig. 6) and the following functionF:U×P→EF(a,b,θ,x)=12(a2−b2+x2−2axcosθ)withu=(a,b)so thatdimU=2,p=(θ,x)so thatdimP=2anddimE=1. Values of dimensional and positional parameters as they appear in Fig. 6 are respectively noteda0,b0andθ0,x0withb0>a0. The crankshaft is revisited in Section  9, and the present mechanism is the planar version of the one in Fig. 18 withα=0andλ=0. Back to notations of Proposition 4, the dependent positional parameter isr=x, the independent positional parameter ist=θand the independent dimensional parameters areu=(a,b). The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to positional parameterxisFx=x−acosθ.Clearly, it does not vanish fora0,θ0andx0. The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to dimensional parametersa,band positional parameterθisF(a,b,θ)=(a−xcosθ,b,axsinθ).Proposition 4 states the existence (and unicity) of local mapping(a,b,θ)↦x(a,b,θ)such thatx(a0,b0,θ0)=x0andF(a,b,θ,x(a,b,θ))=0for all(a,b,θ)in a neighborhood of(a0,b0,θ0). This mapping is the solution of differential equation(7)x′=−(Fx)−1F(a,b,θ).Notationx′is a short cut to replace the vector of partial derivativesx′=(xa,xb,xθ).A practical implementation is to keep one parameter as a variable and to fix all the others. Fixinga=a0andb=b0changes (7) into the following ODE with unknown mappingx=x(θ)(8)x′=−a0xsinθx−a0cosθx(θ0)=x0wherex′is the derivation with respect toθ. Fixingθ=θ0andb=b0changes (7) into the following ODE with unknown mappingx=x(a)(9)x′=−a−xcosθ0x−acosθ0x(a0)=x0wherex′is the derivation with respect toa. Finally, fixingθ=θ0anda=a0changes (7) into the following ODE with unknown mappingx=x(b)(10)x′=−bx−a0cosθ0x(b0)=x0wherex′is the derivation with respect tob. ODE (8) governs the motion of the mobile mechanism according to the commandθ. ODE (9) discloses the influence of dimensional parameteraon positional parameterx, under constant values ofbandθ. ODE (10) discloses the influence of dimensional parameterbon positional parameterx, under constant values ofaandθ. Starting the computation from scratch withFθinstead ofFxyields another field of investigation.The situation discussed in this subsection features an extra condition as a local equation provided by the implicit function theorem. This extra condition changes itself into a rigidity condition or into a mobility condition. The nature of the assembly is totally related to the properties of this local condition.Proposition 5LetM=(U,P,E,F)be an abstract mechanism and let(u0,p0)be an assembly ofM. Variableuis split intou=(v,w)and variablepis split intop=(r,t)wheretis a scalar variable. The argument of functionFis notedF(v,w,r,t). Furthermore,(v0,w0)=u0and(r0,t0)=p0. Suppose that the partial derivativeF(w,r)(v0,w0,r0,t0)is an invertible linear mapping. Then, there exist two unique local functions(v,t)↦w(v,t)and(v,t)↦r(v,t)such thatw0=w(v0,t0),r0=r(v0,t0)andF(v,w(v,t),r(v,t),t)=0for all(v,t)in the neighborhood of(v0,t0).ProofApplying implicit function theorem toFat(v0,w0,r0,t0)yields two unique local functions(v,t)↦w(v,t)and(v,t)↦r(v,t)defined in the neighborhoodV0of(v0,t0)featuring the expected properties.□Assembly of Fig. 10 illustrates Proposition 5. Notingαthe angle between barsdanda, and notingβthe angle between barsdandc, functionF:U×P→EisF(a,b,c,d,e,α,β)=12(a2−b2+2c2+d2−4e2+2d(ccosβ−acosα)a2+c2−4e2+2accos(α−β))withu=(a,b,c,d,e)so thatdimU=5,p=(α,β)so thatdimP=2anddimE=2. Values of dimensional and positional parameters as they appear in drawing (B) of Fig. 10 are respectively noteda0,b0,c0,d0,e0andα0,β0. Notice thatα0=β0. Back to notations of Proposition 5, independent dimensional parameters arev=(a,b,c,d), independent positional parameter ist=α, dependent dimensional parameter isw=eand dependent positional parameter isr=β. The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to dependent parameterse,βis as follows.F(e,β)=(−4e−cdsinβ−4eacsin(α−β)).Furthermore,det(F(e,β))=−4ce(asin(α−β)−dsinβ)does not vanish in the situation of Fig. 10 becauseα0=β0andsinβ0≠0. SoF(e,β)is invertible at(a0,c0,d0,e0,α0,β0). The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to independent parametersa,b,c,d,αisF(a,b,c,d,α)=(Fa,Fb,Fc,Fd,Fα)withFa=(2a−dcosαa+ccos(α−β))Fb=(−b0)Fc=(2c+dcosβc+acos(α−β))andFd=(d+ccosβ0)Fα=(adsinα−acsin(α−β)).Proposition 5 states the existence (and unicity) of local mappings(a,b,c,d,α)↦e(a,b,c,d,α)(a,b,c,d,α)↦β(a,b,c,d,α)such thate(a0,b0,c0,d0,α0)=e0β(a0,b0,c0,d0α0)=β0andF(a,b,c,d,e(a,b,c,d,α),α,β(a,b,c,d,α))=0for all(a,b,c,d,α)in a neighborhood of(a0,b0,c0,d0,α0). These mappings are the solution of differential equation(11)(e′β′)=−(F(e,β))−1F(a,b,c,d,α).Notatione′is a short cut to replace the vector of partial derivativese′=(ea,eb,ec,ed,eα).Same forβ′. Next proposition explains the (local) mobility condition.Proposition 6Under hypothesis ofProposition  5, the assembly(u0,p0)is mobile if and only ifw(v0,t)=w0for alltin the neighborhood oft0.ProofConsider the arcp(t)=(r(v0,t),t)defined in the neighborhood oft0. This arc is such thatF(v0,w(v0,t),r(v0,t),t)=0and|p′(t)|2=|rt(v0,t)|2+1>0for alltin the neighborhood oft0. If the assembly is mobile, then, by Definition 4,F(v0,w0,r(v0,t),t)=0for allt. Since functionst↦w(v0,t)andt↦r(v0,t)are unique, this means thatw(v0,t)=w0for allt. The reciprocal is straightforward.□Proposition 6 is illustrated by drawing (A) of Fig. 10, wherea0=c0=e0,b0=d0andα0=β0. Intuitively, when changing the value of angleα, angleβchanges accordingly while lengtheremains constant. Indeed, in the context of Proposition 6, parametersa,b,canddare fixed bya=c=a0andb=d=b0. This changes differential equation (11) into the ODE(12)(e′β′)=(4ea0b0sinβ4e−a02sin(α−β))−1(a0b0sinα−a02sin(α−β))associated with initial condition(13)e(α0)=a0β(α0)=α0whereα↦e(α)andα↦β(α)are the unknown functions. As expected, the (unique) solution of (12)(13) isβ(α)=αande(α)=a0for allαin a neighborhood ofα0. Next proposition explains the (local) rigidity condition.Proposition 7Under hypothesis ofProposition  5, the assembly(u0,p0)is rigid if and only ift0is an isolated solution of equationw(v0,t)−w0=0.ProofSupposing thatt0is an isolated solution of equationw(v0,t)−w0=0and applying Lemma 3 withx(t)=w(v0,t), andy(t)=(r(v0,t),t)proves thatp0=(r(v0,t0),t0)is an isolated solution ofF(u0,p)=0, meaning that the assembly is rigid. Iftis close enough tot0thenF(v0,w(v0,t),r(v0,t),t)=0. If, in addition,w(v0,t)−w0=0, thenF(v0,w0,r(v0,t),t)=0. Supposing thatp0is an isolated solution ofF(u0,p)=0implies that, iftis close enough tot0then(r(v0,t),t)is close enough top0so that(r(v0,t),t)=p0=(r(v0,t0),t0)andt=t0as expected.□Proposition 7 is illustrated with a version of assembly in Fig. 10 where barsaandcare not parallel and barsbanddare not parallel, as illustrated in Fig. 14. Parametersa,b,canddare fixed bya=a0,b=b0,c=c0andd=d0as they appear in Fig. 14.This changes differential equation (11) into the ODE(14)(e′β′)=(4ec0d0sinβ4e−a0c0sin(α−β))−1(a0d0sinα−a0c0sin(α−β))associated with initial condition(15)e(α0)=e0β(α0)=β0.Initial derivativee′(α0)can be computed by writing (14) atα=α0and using initial condition (15). This yieldse′(α0)=a0d04c0e0sin(α0−β0)(a0sinα0−c0sinβ0)a0sin(α0−β0)+d0sinβ0which does not vanish because barsaandcare not parallel and barsbanddare not parallel. Consequently,α0is an isolated zero of mappingα↦e(α)−e0, meaning that the mechanism is rigid. If barsaandcare parallel or barsbanddare parallel, but not both, thene′(α0)=0ande″(α0)≠0. This can be proven by derivating (14), so thatα0is again an isolated zero of mappingα↦e(α)−e0, meaning that the mechanism is rigid. This is illustrated by drawing (B) in Fig. 10. Finally, if barsaandcare parallel and barsbanddare parallel, the mechanism is mobile.Theoretical investigation is now continued. LetWbe the set of parametersvsuch thatt↦w(v,t)is a constant function in some neighborhood oft0. If, for example, functionw(⋅)does not depend on variablet, thenWis non empty and is a neighborhood ofv0. By definition, the complementary setWcofWis the set of parametersvsuch thatt↦w(v,t)is a non constant function in all neighborhoods oft0.Proposition 8Under hypothesis ofProposition  5, ifv0∈Wand ifWcontains a sequence(vi)i>0such thatvi≠v0for alliandvi→v0wheni→+∞then, the assembly(u0,p0)can feature a mobile-to-mobile transition.ProofThe proof is straightforward.□Proposition 8 is illustrated by assembly (A) in Fig. 10 withW={(a,b,c,d)∈R4;a=c,b=d}which makes it mobile. Accordingly, it can be perturbed into another mobile mechanism by keeping dimensional parameters insideW, as illustrated in Fig. 15.Proposition 9Under hypothesis ofProposition  5, ifv0∈Wand if the complementary setWcofWcontains a sequence(vi)i>0such thatvi→v0wheni→+∞then, the assembly(u0,p0)can feature a mobile-to-rigid transition.ProofSincevi∈Wc, there exists a sequence(sij)jsuch thatsij→t0whenj→+∞andw(vi,sij)≠w(vi,t0)for allj. Functionφi(s)=|w(vi,s)−w(vi,t0)|2is such thatφi(sij)≠0. Applying the mean value theorem to functionφi(⋅)on interval[sij,t0]yieldss̃ij∈[sij,t0]such thatφi′(s̃ij)=φi(sij)−φi(t0)sij−t0=φi(sij)sij−t0≠0.Consequently,s=s̃ijis an isolated solution of equationφi(s)−φi(s̃ij)=0and also an isolated solution of equationw(vi,s̃)−w(vi,s̃ij)=0. Consider the diagonal sequence defined byti=sii. It is such thatti→t0wheni→+∞and thatt=tiis an isolated solution of equationw(vi,t)−w(vi,ti)=0for eachi. Consequently, for eachi,F(vi,w(vi,t),r(vi,t),t)=0for alltin the neighborhood ofti. Thanks to Proposition 7 this means thatp=pi=(r(vi,ti),ti)is an isolated solution of equationF(ui,p)=0whereui=(vi,w(vi,ti)). In other words,(ui,pi)iis a sequence of rigid assemblies converging to the mobile assembly(u0,p0).□This situation is illustrated in drawing (B) of Fig. 10.Clearly, properties of first order derivation make previous investigation successful, but rigid-to-mobile transition does not fit any of them. This section illustrates how functionFcan feature a behavior that requires a second order investigation, mainly the simple bifurcation theory. This theory  [23] is a powerful tool to investigate singularities, see  [24] for example. First case is the planar mobile mechanism made of four articulated bars that is stretched in such a way that the longest length is equal to the sum of all three others, sayd=a+b+c, as illustrated in Fig. 12. Clearly, this assembly is rigid. Furthermore, keepinga,bandcconstant and perturbingdinto a smaller value makes the assembly mobile, while perturbingdinto a larger value makes it impossible. In short, the assemblyd=a+b+cis able to rigid-to-mobile transition as well as rigid-to-impossible transition. This behavior fits the state transition framework, but the simple bifurcation theory is mandatory to understand how functionFcan feature the phenomenon. Suppose thatd>a+b+cin order to set up the equation. By fixing the ends of bardat(0,0)and(d,0), by noting(x,y)the coordinates of the mobile end of baraand(s,t)the coordinates of mobile end of barc, the mechanism can be described as follows.F(a,b,c,d,x,y,s,t)=12(x2+y2−a2(s−x)2+(t−y)2−b2(s−d)2+t2−c2).Dimensional parameter isu=(a,b,c,d)and positional parameter isp=(x,y,s,t). The rigidity of the assembly is obtained withd=a+b+c,(x0,y0)=(a,0)and(s0,t0)=(a+b,0), meaning thatu0=(a,b,c,a+b+c)andp0=(a,0,a+b,0). Applying Theorem 2 to function(x,y,s,t)↦F(a,b,c,d,x,y,s,t)proves that point(x0,y0,s0,t0)is an isolated solution so that the assembly is rigid.Second case is the same planar mobile mechanism made of four articulated bars wherea+b=c+d. The assembly can be flattened but mobility is saved. The particularity is that in the flattened position there is a choice between two motions from point(x0,y0,s0,t0), as illustrated in Fig. 16. Here again, first order condition of Propositions 4–6 are not relevant and the simple bifurcation Theorem 2 is mandatory to understand how functionFcan feature the phenomenon.It is time now to compare the previous definitions to the standard vocabulary: iso-constrained, over-constrained, paradoxical etc. First column of Table 1is the list of traditional expressions. Second column includes all possible transitions that an assembly of a given kind can perform. An iso-constrained rigid assembly can only feature the rigid-to-rigid transition, meaning that any small dimensional perturbation does not change the nature of the assembly. An iso-constrained mobile assembly features the same behavior: any small dimensional perturbation changes the initial assembly into another mobile assembly. A over-constrained rigid assembly behaves as follows. Some small dimensional perturbation can change it into an impossible configuration and some other small dimensional perturbation can change it into another rigid assembly. It should be noticed that the present theory defines “over-constrained” by the effect on the assembly. Intuitively, it can be broken by an arbitrary small perturbation. Conversely, traditional definitions deal with counting constraints or scalar equation or computing some rank deficiency. A paradoxical assembly is a mobile assembly that some arbitrary small dimensional perturbation can change into a rigid assembly. Some other arbitrary small dimensional perturbation can change it into another mobile assembly. When characterized by the first order sufficient condition of Proposition 5, some dimensional perturbation can change it into an impossible configuration. The crankshaft mechanism, detailed hereinafter, provides an example of a paradoxical assembly that may not feature the mobile-to-impossible transition.It can be noticed that, apparently, the rigid-to-mobile transition does not fit any traditional definition.So far, assembly examples are mainly planar articulated systems of rigid bars. One may argue that they are not realistic from the mechanical point of view. This section provides examples of real life 3D crankshaft mechanism.As illustrated in Fig. 17, the crankshaft mechanism under study includes three rigid bodies: crank, connecting rod and frame. Rod and frame geometries are idealized byL-shape wires. Vertical lines of both “L” being axis for revolute or cylindrical links. Crank geometry is idealized by aU-shape wire. Lines perpendicular to the horizontal line of the “U” being axis for revolute or cylindrical links. The rod–frame link, which in real life involves the piston, is idealized by a point–line coincidence. The crank radius isa>0and the length of the connecting rod isb>0. A non perfect crank is defined by setting dimensional parameterα≠0, meaning that its axis are not parallel (Figs. 17 and 18). Conversely, a perfect crank is such thatα=0, meaning that its axis are parallel. Once mounted, angleθmeasures the angular position of the crank with respect to the frame (Fig. 18). If the crank is non perfect, parameterλmeasures the sliding offset along the axis shared by the crank and the rod (Fig. 18). General equation of the crankshaft mechanism is the following.(16)F(a,b,α,λ,θ,x)=(λ+xsinθsinαx2−λ2−2axcosθ+a2−b2).The assembly positioning under study is defined bya=a0>0,b=b0>0,θ=θ0=0andx0=a0+b0, meaning that the crank and the rod are collinear. A revolute link joining the connecting rod to the crank is obtained by settingλ=0, thus consideringλas a dimensional parameter. A cylindrical link joining the connecting rod to the crank is obtained by considering parameterλas a positional parameter modeling the sliding effect. Table 2gathers all situations.The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to positional parameters(θ,x)is(17)F(θ,x)=(xcosθsinαsinθsinα2axsinθ2x−2acosθ).Before analyzing this mechanism by using previous theorems, it is interesting to compute the mobility index in each situation. The crankshaft mechanism includesnb=3bodies andnj=3joints. The revolute crank–frame link features one degree of freedom. The rod–frame is a point on line link and features four degrees of freedom. If the crank–rod link is a revolute link, it features one degree of freedom. Then, according to graph of Fig. 19(A) the associated mobility index is(18)δ=n−6(nj−nb+1)=1+4+1−6(3−3+1)=0meaning rigidity. If the crank–rod link is a cylindrical link, it features two degrees of freedom. Then, according to graph of Fig. 19(B) the associated mobility index is(19)δ=n−6(nj−nb+1)=1+4+2−6(3−3+1)=1meaning mobility. Whether the crank is perfect (α=0) or not (α≠0) is irrelevant in the mobility index computation, which makes it questionable as seen in subsequent sections.Suppose that the crank–rod link is a revolute link, meaning thatλis not a positional parameter. Since, from (17),(20)det(F(θ,x))=2xsinα(xcosθ−a)it is clear from Proposition 2 that ifα=α0≠0, that is if the crank is not perfect, then the assembly(θ,x)=(0,a0+b0)is rigid because the partial derivative with respect to all positional parameters is invertible. Furthermore, this rigid status is preserved under any small perturbation of dimensions(a,b,α,λ)in the neighborhood of(a0,b0,α0,0). This behavior is correctly anticipated by (18) despite it does not take into account the non perfectness of the crank.Suppose a cylindrical crank–rod link, so thatλis a positional parameter. The partial derivative of functionFwith respect to positional parametersλandxisF(λ,x)=(1sinθsinα−2λ2x−2acosθ).Evaluated in the assembly positioning(λ,θ,x)=(0,0,a0+b0), this matrix becomes(21)(1002b0)which is invertible. Thanks to Proposition 4, the assembly is mobile and the geometric motion is locally parameterized byθ↦(λ(θ),x(θ),θ)where functionsλ(⋅)andx(⋅)are provided by the implicit function theorem. Furthermore, mobility is saved under any small perturbation of dimensional parameters(a,b,α)in the neighborhood of(a0,b0,α0),α0being zero or not. This means that the mobility is saved whether the crank is perfect or not, as anticipated by (19).Finally, suppose a revolute crank–rod link (λ=0is a dimensional parameter) and a perfect crank (α=0). As previously computed (20), the partial derivativeF(θ,x)is not invertible in the assembly positioning but, from (21), the partial derivativeF(λ,x)is invertible in the assembly positioning. This means that, according to Proposition 5, two unique local functionsλ=λ(a,b,α,θ)andx=x(a,b,α,θ)exist such thatλ(a0,b0,0,0)=0x(a0,b0,0,0)=a0+b0andF(a,b,α,λ(a,b,α,θ),θ,x(a,b,α,θ))=0for all(a,b,α,θ)in the neighborhood of(a0,b0,0,0). Mobility is there provided functionθ↦λ(a0,b0,0,θ)remains constant. This can be investigated through the differential equation resulting from the implicit function theorem. For clarity, fixed dimensional parametersa=a0,b=b0andα=0are omitted so that functionsλ(⋅)andx(⋅)only depend on variableθ. Derivatives with respect toθare writtenλ′(⋅)andx′(⋅). The differential equation is(22)(λ′x′)=−(F(λ,x))−1Fθthat is(23)(λ′(θ)x′(θ))=−(10−2λ2x−2a0cosθ)−1(02a0xsinθ)associated with the initial conditionλ(0)=0andx(0)=a0+b0. In particular, by computing the inverse matrix in Eq. (23), this impliesλ′(θ)=0, meaning that functionλ(⋅)is constant and null in a neighborhood ofθ=0. According to Proposition 6, this proves mobility. This behavior contradicts (18).In order to understand the influence of parameterα, rewriting differential equation (22) at the initial valueθ=0and withα=α0≠0yields(λ′(0)x′(0))=−(1002b0)−1((a0+b0)sinα00)from whichλ′(0)=−(a0+b0)sinα0. Consequently, ifα0≠0thenλ′(0)≠0andθ=0is an isolated solution of equationλ(θ)=0, which proves, from Proposition 7, that the assembly is rigid. This means that an arbitrary small and non zero perturbation of parameterαchanges the mobile crankshaft into a rigid one.There is another way to capture a revolute crank–rod link in the equation. Just substitute parameterλby the zero value in function (16). This removes symbolλand changes the function intoF(a,b,α,θ,x)=(xsinθsinαx2−2axcosθ+a2−b2).Computing the derivative of this function with respect to all variables in the assembly configuration yieldsF′(a0,b0,0,0,a0+b0)=(000002a0−2b0002b0)which is quite singular. Nevertheless, by applying Theorem 2 to function(α,θ,x)↦F(a0,b0,α,θ,x), it can be proven that the solution of equationF=0includes two curves in the(α,θ,x)space crossing at(α,θ,x)=(0,0,a0+b0). One arc is included in planeα=0, while the other one is such thatθ=0andx=a0+b0. Here again, the assembly is mobile whenα=0(in contradiction with (18)) and rigid whenα≠0, meaning that mobile-to-rigid transition is possible. As opposed to Propositions 5–7, the mobile-to-impossible transition is out of reach in this situation. This is becauseθ(a,b,α)=0andx(a,b,α)=a+bare always solution.Table 3synthesizes the analysis of the crankshaft mechanism. The wording is the one defined by Table 1.
