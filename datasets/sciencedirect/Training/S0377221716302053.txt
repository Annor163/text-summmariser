@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Inverse data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a reversed optimization problem that can serve as a useful planning tool for managerial decisions by providing information such as how much resources (or outcomes) should be invested (or produced) to achieve a desired level of competitiveness whereas the conventional DEA focuses mainly on a post-hoc assessment of the organizational performance. Inverse DEA studies however are based on an assumption that the efficiency level of observed decision making units (DMUs) will not change within the period of interest, which in fact confines the use of inverse DEA to a sensitivity analysis by simply addressing what alternative levels of input and/or output would have been possible to result in the same efficiency score obtained. In this paper, we discuss an inverse DEA problem considering expected changes of the production frontier in the future by integrating the inverse optimization problem with a time series application of DEA so that it can be an ex-ante decision support tool for the new product target setting practices. We use an example of the vehicle engine development case to demonstrate the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
While conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) measures the relative efficiencies of decision making units (DMUs) with given input and output levels (Charnes, Cooper, & Rhodes, 1978), the inverse DEA approach aims to estimate feasible input and/or output levels to attain a predetermined efficiency within the DEA framework (Wei, Zhang, & Zhang, 2000). This reversed optimization problem can serve as a useful planning tool for managerial decisions by providing information such as how much resources (or outcomes) should be invested (or produced) to achieve a desired level of competitiveness whereas traditional DEA focuses mainly on a post-hoc assessment of the organizational performance.The idea of inverse DEA was first introduced by Zhang and Cui (1999) in the context of project evaluation in public sectors, and subsequently formalized by Wei et al. (2000) using the multiple-objective linear programming (MOLP) techniques. Since then the property of MOLP to solve the inverse DEA problem has seen various extensions particularly with respect to scalarization methods to convert it into a single objective LP problem by incorporating decision makers’ preferences, see e.g., Jahanshahloo, Hadi Vencheh, Foroughi, & Kazemi Matin (2004), Jahanshahloo, Lotfi, Shoja, Tohidi, and Razavyan (2005) and Yan, Wei, and Hao (2002). Other streams of literature have also contributed to the methodological developments such as input estimation for resource allocation (Li & Cui, 2008; Yan et al., 2002), relaxed input-output estimations (Hadi-Vencheh & Asghar Foroughi, 2006), simultaneous increases of some outputs and decreases of the other outputs (Lertworasirikul, Charnsethikul, & Fang, 2011), inter-temporal application (Jahanshahloo, Soleimani-damaneh, & Ghobadi, 2015), and fuzzy inverse DEA (Ghobadi & Jahangiri, 2015). In addition to the illustrative examples provided in the above literature, inverse DEA has been used to solve a wide range of real world problems including recent applications on revenue target setting (Lin, 2010), agricultural demand estimation (Frija, Wossink, Buysse, Speelman, & Van Huylenbroeck, 2011), and performance anticipation of merged banks (Gattoufi, Amin, & Emrouznejad, 2014).It is however important to note that in spite of its original intention to serve as an ex-ante decision support tool the issue of frontier changes has received little attention in the inverse DEA literature. That is, the inverse DEA studies are based on an assumption that the efficiency level of observed DMUs will not change within the period of interest. This in fact confines the use of inverse DEA to an ex-post sensitivity analysis by simply addressing what alternative levels of input and/or output would have been possible to result in the same efficiency score rather than what input and/or output levels should be planned to achieve a desired level of competitiveness in the future.In this paper, we discuss an inverse DEA problem considering expected changes of the production frontier in the future. As we shall elaborate in the following sections, this approach necessitates an integrated framework of the inverse optimization problem with the analysis of the frontier changes. The work is therefore intended to enrich the literature not only on inverse DEA problems but also on time series applications of DEA as a predictive decision support tool for the new product target setting practices.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, preliminaries for inverse DEA and the measurement of frontier changes are provided with the relevant significant works. Section 3 provides an integrated framework of an inverse DEA with the frontier changes formulated as a single objective LP problem. Section 4 demonstrates the proposed method by applying it to the development case of vehicle engine. Finally, Section 5 provides a summary of results and possible future research directions.Suppose there are n DMUs and letx=(x1,…,xm)∈ℜ+Mdenote an input vector,y=(y1,…,ys)∈ℜ+San output vector. Following the minimum extrapolation principle (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984), the production possibility set (PPS) can be formulated as follows.(1)PPS={(x,y)|∑jλjxj≤x,∑jλjyj≥y,λj≥0,j=1,…,n}Note that the constant returns to scale (CRS) is implicitly assumed by having the sum of the intensity vector λjunconstrained. The increasing (IRS), decreasing (DRS), or variable returns to scale (VRS) can be assumed by adding a constraint∑jλj≥1,∑jλj≤1,or∑jλj=1respectively.With the PPS specified, efficiency measurement can take various forms. Conventional DEA provides a radial and oriented measure (Charnes et al., 1978), which can be presented as (2) for input-orientation or (3) for output-orientation.(2)1/zk*=min{θk:(θkxk,yk)∈PPS}(3)zk*=max{ϕk:(xk,ϕkyk)∈PPS}The obtained efficiency score zk*, i.e., ϕk*(or 1/θk*), reflects the largest proportion to which the current level of production can be improved pro rata to reach the best practice production identified for each DMU k. That being said, DMU k is (at least weakly) efficient ifzk*=1, or inefficient if zk* > 1.In inverse DEA, the situation is reversed and input and/or output levels are to be estimated with a given efficiency score. Following notations of Wei et al. (2000), let αkdenote increased input(s), i.e.,αk=xk+Δxk, and βkincreased output(s), i.e.,βk=yk+Δyk, of DMU k.For output estimation, Wei et al. (2000) restricted the problem to non-negative changes. To formulate this, a subsetPPS¯kof PPS can be defined as (4)11For the sake of conciseness without losing generality in the presentation, subscripts are omitted when corresponding vectors indicate all their components such as αk≥ xkapplies to all input vectorsi=1,…,m.to prevent any decreases in both input and output changes.(4)PPS¯k=PPS∩{αk≥xkandβk≥yk}In the case where DMU k was inefficient, i.e., zk* > 1, an inverse DEA problem for output estimation would then be formulated as follows.(5)βk*=max{(β1k,…,βsk):(αk,ϕk*βk)∈PPS¯k}This MOLP model can be conveniently transformed into a single objective LP problem using the weighted sum method. For instance, if there was a preference vector,w∈ℜ+S, for each output to be weighted, the multiple objectives of (5) could be reduced to a single objective function of∑rwrβrk. See other scalarization methods for MOLP in Ruzika and Wiecek (2005) and special cases in inverse DEA settings in Wei et al. (2000).In the case where DMU k was (at least weakly) efficient, i.e.,zk*=1, the problem would become less straightforward as changes in input might affect thePPS¯kand hence there may be two possible situations: a) DMU with increased input(s) can still maintain an efficient status without a need to increase any outputs; b) increased input(s) requires an increase in at least one output for the DMU to be (at least weakly) efficient. Wei et al. (2000) proposed that, in both situations, the output target βkcorresponding to the increased input(s) αkcan be sufficiently estimated asz˜k*ykwherez˜k*is an optimal solution of the following LP problem.(6)max{z˜k:(αk,z˜kyk)∈PPS}For the input estimation, Hadi-Vencheh and Foroughi (2006) proposed a relaxed MOLP problem allowing arbitrary changes regardless of the efficiency score of zk*. This can be shown as (7).(7)αk*=min{(α1k,…,αmk):(θk*αk,βk)∈PPS}A feasible solution of (7) suffices to estimate a virtual DMUk^of (αk*, βk) that retains the input efficiency score of θk* unless the obtained solution is a weak Pareto optimum with any one of its estimated input levels (αik*) being equal to the corresponding input levels (xik). In other words, (7) can be deemed a general inverse DEA model for the input estimation if and only if the obtained solution is either a strong Pareto optimum or a weak Pareto optimum with strictly positive input changes, i.e., Δxk≥ 0 and Δxk≠ 0 (Hadi-Vencheh, Foroughi, & Soleimani-damaneh, 2008).It is important to recognize that although the above theoretical developments of inverse DEA are built upon the notion of MOLP, they are often solved by combining the multiple objectives into one single objective scalar function using the weighted sum method in practice. Besides, the Pareto front of the standard DEA production set is presumed to be convex22Special cases in which the convexity axiom does not hold, e.g., free disposal hull (Deprins et al., 1984), are left outside the scope of this study.and hence such scalarization method with strictly positive weights always yields a strong Pareto optimal solution (Caramia & Dell'Olmo, 2008; Geoffrion, 1968). In that sense, throughout the paper we confine our discussion to a single objective LP problem using the weighted sum method to eliminate the need to perform any type of post hoc test related to the weak Pareto optimality.The body of literature pertaining to the time-series application of DEA may be divided into two strands: ex-post approach and ex-ante approach.The ex-post approach focuses on a changing performance of DMUs over time (Charnes, Clark, Cooper, & Golany, 1984; Cooper, Seiford, & Tone, 2006). Possibly the most widely used technique is a DEA-based Malmquist productivity index developed by Fare, Grosskopf, and Lovell (1994). The Malmquist index is a composite productivity measure obtained from independent observations of the same DMUs in two different time periods. This index can also be decomposed into two sub-indices: one for the frontier shift and the other for the technical efficiency change, to which the organizational productivity changes between two time periods can be attributed. See comprehensive surveys of the theory in Färe, Grosskopf, and Roos (1998) and Coelli, Prasada Rao, O'Donnell, and Battese (2005) and recent extensions in Färe, Grosskopf, and Margaritis (2011).The ex-ante approach, by contrast, focuses mainly on the predictive use of DEA that aims to measure the frontier changes in the past whereby the arrival of future DMUs, i.e., virtual production possibilities, can be estimated (Anderson, Daim, & Kim, 2008; Inman, Anderson, & Harmon, 2006; Lim, Anderson, & Shott, 2015a). This approach has drawn attention particularly in the technological forecasting contexts as performance improvements are typically desired and therefore expansions of the technology frontier are expected to continue in the future (Lim, Runde, & Anderson, 2013). An early attempt to quantify the frontier changes was made in Anderson, Färe, Grosskopf, Inman, and Song (2002) by looking at how fast formerly efficient DMUs have been outperformed by the newly created frontiers. Later, Lim, Jahromi, Anderson, and Tudorie (2015b) extended the model to be able to identify the segmented rate of change from each frontier facet so that the progress patterns from different DMU clusters can be taken into account.To present the rate of frontier changes using notations previously defined, let us introduce superscripts specifying a point in time such thatzkt*is the efficiency score of DMU k from PPStspanned by DMUs up to time t. Also let tkdenote the production time of each DMU k, and T the vantage point from which the rate of change (RoC) is captured. Thenzktk*= 1 andzkT*> 1 indicates that DMU k had been (at least weakly) efficient at its production time but became outperformed by the newly created production frontier at T. To combine such information of efficiency changes in the past, it is imperative to first normalize them to the same time scale. As for the treatment of this, Anderson et al. (2002) proposed the notion of ‘effective time’ to indicate the time gap between the production frontiers. With that, the standardized RoC observed by surpassed DMU k can be obtained as (8). The guiding premise is that the RoC (γkT) is to be raised to the effective time (∑jλjkT*(tj−tk)/∑jλjkT*) during which the efficiency change (zkT*) has been induced to DMU k.(8)γkT=(zkT*)∑jλjkT*∑jλjkT*(tj−tk),∀k|zktk*=1,zkT*>1The idea of the RoC segmentation can then be implemented by taking the weighted average of the frontier changes observed in the past. Specifically, the local RoC indicates an accumulated rate of the frontier changes represented by each DMU located on the production frontier at T, that is, for peer DMU j of surpassed DMU k. If we define a DMU set ETin such a way thatET={j|zjT*=1}, i.e., a set of efficient DMUs at T, the calculation of the local RoC can be presented as (9) where the numerator indicates the weighted sum of the frontier changes observed from outperformed DMUs that have set DMU j as a benchmark and the denominator indicates the accumulated contribution of DMU j to the expansion of the corresponding frontier facet.(9)δjT=∑kλjkT*γkT∑k,γkT>0λjkT*,∀j∈ETOnce the local RoCs have been obtained, it becomes possible to estimate the time by which desired levels of production possibilities, i.e., virtual DMUs, will be operational using super-efficiency. See more discussions on the computational details in Lim (2015) and Lim, Anderson, and Inman (2014) and a relevant recent application in Lim et al. (2015a).In this section, we propose an integrated framework for the inverse DEA problem for the output estimation considering the frontier changes in the future.Building on prior works, let us first define the production possibility setPPST+Δtspanned by virtual DMUs at a future pointT+Δt. As noted earlier, each DMU efficient at T is to have a local RoC (δjT) indicating the potential rate of improvement obtained from how fast relevant DMUs have been surpassed in the past. Therefore, it may be reasonable to postulate that thePPST+Δtwould be constituted by enhanced production possibilities33Not all of these reference points will necessarily serve as anchor points (Bougnol and Dulá, 2009) due to varying local RoCs.(augmented outputs in the output estimation case) from efficient DMUs at T fulfilling the expected improvements during Δt (see Fig. 1).This leads to the formulation of thePPST+Δtin (10). Note that the output levels (yrj) of the efficient DMUs at T are augmented based on the corresponding local RoCs (δjT), which then spans the PPS of(xT+Δt,yT+Δt)atT+Δt.(10)PPST+Δt={(xT+Δt,yT+Δt)|∑j∈ETλjxj≤xT+Δt,∑j∈ETλj(δjT)Δtyj≥yT+Δt,λj≥0,j∈ET}As in Wei et al. (2000), we frame the output estimation model such that any negative output changes are precluded. It should be noted here that there is no theoretical reason to prevent output decreases and this might be a redundant constraint unless an extreme weight vector is used. However we do this for practical reasons that the performance regression, in general, is not a desirable objective of the new product target setting practices. To do this, a subset ofPPST+Δt, i.e.,PPS¯kT+Δt, is defined as (11).(11)PPS¯kT+Δt=PPST+Δt∩{βkT+Δt≥yk}Next, based on the above definitions, when the inputs of DMU k changes from xktoαkT+Δtthe inverse DEA problem for the output estimation to yield the target efficiency ofτk^T+Δt, which by definition must lie between 1 andϕkT+Δt*, can be formulated as (12).(12)βkT+Δt*=max{∑rwrβrkT+Δt:(αkT+Δt,τk^T+ΔtβkT+Δt)∈PPS¯kT+Δt}As discussed before, wris a predefined weight vector for each output (r) to be prioritized. By having w > 0, (12) will yield a strong Pareto optimal solution. It is a point worthy of note that, when the weighted sum method is used, there is not an a-priori correspondence between a weight vector and a solution vector. That being said, the imposed weighting coefficients, i.e., wr, do not necessarily reflect the relative importance of outputs per se particularly in the case where the output vector presents varying scales (just like multiplier DEA weights). In addition, as demonstrated in the next section, a spread of solution vectors may also be dependent on the trade-off surfaces onto which the investigated production possibility is to be projected. Therefore, care must be taken to determine a weight vector such that it is consistent with the view of decision makers.One may notice that unlike the conventional inverse DEA we did not constrain Δxkto be strictly positive. In fact, we subsume the cases of decreased input as well as constant input to examine how much the expanded production frontier in the future would affect those production possibilities. Note that there is no frontier change contemplated in the conventional inverse DEA and therefore the constant input is not an option for consideration and the decreased input might render the model infeasible unless there were input slack(s) as implied in the strong disposability principle. On the contrary, there may exist a range of non-positive input changes that still requires output increases to obtain a designated target efficiency score when the expansion of the production frontier in the future is taken into account.To specify the allowable input changes, we provide the following Lemma 1.Lemma 1θkT+Δt*xkis the minimum possible input level ofαkT+Δtthat keeps problem (12) feasible whereθkT+Δt*is an optimal solution of the following problem.(13)min{θkT+Δt:(θkT+Δtxk,τk^T+Δtyk)∈PPS¯kT+Δt}ProofLet us show a contradiction by supposing that there existed a virtual DMUk^having input levels ofpθkT+Δt*xkwhere p < 1 which can yield a feasible solution in (12). By definition, a virtual DMU of(pθkT+Δt*xk,βkT+Δt*)should be satisfying the constraints of (12) such that∑j∈ETλ¯jkxij≤pθkT+Δt*xkand∑j∈ETλ¯jk(δjT)Δtyrj≥τk^T+ΔtβkT+Δt*≥τk^T+Δtyk. Hence, one can see that an obtained solution set, say(pθkT+Δt*,λ¯k), would be a feasible solution of (13). However, this would violate the optimality of (13) aspθkT+Δt*<θkT+Δt*. Therefore, to keep the problem (12) feasible, a changed input level must be no less thanθkT+Δt*xk. □Having specified the lower bound of input changes to guarantee the feasibility of (12), we now verify that the estimated virtual DMUk^yields the designated target efficiency score by following Lemma 2.Lemma 2An optimal solution of the following problem is equal toτk^T+Δt.(14)max{ϕk^T+Δt:(αkT+Δt,ϕk^T+ΔtβkT+Δt*)∈PPS¯kT+Δt}ProofLetϕk^T+Δt*denote an optimal solution of (14) then we must show thatϕk^T+Δt*=τk^T+Δt. Notice that problem (12) maximizes the value ofβkT+Δtwith a given set of values:αkT+Δtandτk^T+Δtwhile problem (14) maximizes the value ofϕk^T+Δtwith a given set of values:αkT+ΔtandβkT+Δt*within the same PPS. Similar to the relationship between (12) and (13) in proof of Lemma 1, it is not difficult to see thatτk^T+Δtis a feasible solution of (14) whereasϕk^T+Δt*is an optimal solution of (14), from which we can see thatϕk^T+Δt*≥τk^T+Δt. Now ifϕk^T+Δt*>τk^T+Δtin (12), this would allow a feasible solution set, say(β¯¯kT+Δt,λ¯¯k), whereβ¯¯kT+Δtis greater thanβkT+Δt*as the output constraint would be satisfied such that∑j∈ETλ¯¯jk(δjT)Δtyrj≥τk^T+Δtβ¯¯kT+Δt=ϕk^T+Δt*βkT+Δt*>τk^T+ΔtβkT+Δt*. This would contradict the fact thatβkT+Δt*is an optimal solution of (12), that is the maximum value. Consequently, we must haveϕk^T+Δt*=τk^T+Δt.□By combining the above two lemmas, the following theorem can be finally established.Theorem 1If DMU k changes from (xk, yk) to(αkT+Δt,βkT+Δt*), whereαkT+Δtis no less thanθkT+Δt*xk,θkT+Δt*is an optimal solution of (13), andβkT+Δt*is an optimal solution of (12), that virtual DMUk^will yield a predetermined output efficiency score ofτk^T+ΔtatT+Δt.ProofBy Lemma 1 in conjunction with the strong disposability principle, the problem (12) has a feasible solution, i.e., the output estimation ofβkT+Δt*corresponding toαkT+Δt. The resulting virtual DMUk^of (αkT+Δt,βkT+Δt*) will then yield an output efficiency score ofϕk^T+Δt*equivalent toτk^T+ΔtatT+Δtby Lemma 2. □In light of Theorem 1, the following corollaries can bereadily recognized.Corollary 1Suppose the input level of DMU k changes from xk toαkT+Δtwithin an allowable range by settingτk^T+Δt=ϕkT*in (13), the resulting virtual DMUk^by (12) will retain its original output efficiency score, i.e.,ϕk^T+Δt*=ϕkT*, atT+Δt.Corollary 2Suppose the input level of DMU k changes from xk toαkT+Δtwithin an allowable range by settingτk^T+Δtto a value between 1 andϕkT+Δt*in (13), the resulting virtual DMUk^by (12) will have a predetermined output efficiency score, i.e.,ϕk^T+Δt*=τk^T+Δt, atT+Δt.In this section, we demonstrate the proposed method by applying it to the new product target setting practices for vehicle engine development. We particularly focus on a forced induction system: turbo or super-charged engines, which has become accepted as a viable alternative technology for the internal combustion engines to comply with current stringent environmental regulations. The forced induction system, in fact, has shown a steady progress in technical efficiency, which is expected to continue with a fierce competition among auto companies. We will illustrate how the proposed method can guide the performance target setting strategy in this context.The dataset has been collected to cover total 370 vehicles from 44 manufacturers equipped with distinct forced induction systems (4, 6, and 8 cylinder) from model year (MY) 2005 to 2015. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) database was the main source for a full list of vehicles introduced in the U.S. market and manufacturers’ technical reports were cross referenced for the performance figures: displacement, power, and torque. Table 1 summarizes the data.To assess the pure technical efficiency changes of the forced induction system over the past 10 years, an output-oriented DEA model was constructed by one input: displacement and two outputs: power and torque. In addition, VRS was considered to be an appropriate returns to scale assumption given the wide variability of input and outputs. Table 2 lists eight vehicle models found to be equipped with efficient engines in 2015. Not surprisingly the technology frontier is constructed of recent MY 2014 and 2015 models only, which may imply a steady performance improvement in the past.As discussed earlier, the identified local RoCs can be interpreted here as annualized output improvements observed in the past and hence be utilized to estimate the production frontier in the future. For example, DMU 143 may represent a small engine segment with 9.7 percent of annual performance improvement observed in engines formerly efficient but later superseded by DMU 143. One may therefore expect that DMU 143 would also be surpassed by the newly created frontiers continuing this rate of progress in the future. If the target year is 2018, for instance, the expected power output for DMU 143 would be 190 × 1.09683 ≈ 250.69. The reference technology for the target year can then be estimated by combining those expected performance changes that would make current efficient DMUs obsolete.We now turn to the performance target setting practices based on the proposed method. Suppose that the design team of DMU 262, the Porsche 911 Turbo S, is planning for the next generation engine for its successor due in 2018 (Δt=3). To begin with, let us first see how competitive the current design is. As shown in Table 3, its current efficiency (ϕ2622015*) is found to be 1.0371 and given the rate of technological progress observed and therefore expected, it would become more surpassed to have an efficiency score of 1.1477 (ϕ2622018*) in 2018. In other words, the current design specifications would be subject to about 3.4 percent of annual rate of obsolescence55(ϕ2622018*/ϕ2622015*)1/Δt=(1.1477/1.0371)1/3≈1.0344.due to the expected technological advances.Next, we consider various scenarios for the output estimation. Let us first focus on a case in which the design team wants to retain its current level of efficiency in 2018 (τ262^2018=ϕ2622015*). To also take into account design possibilities from different input cases, we solve the model (13) to obtain a lower bound of the input change (θ2622018*x1,262). This confirms the limit of downsized engine designs that can be explored to be 3.16 liter and hence let us give examples by considering three input levels (α1,2622018): downsized 3.5 liter, current 3.8 liter, and upsized 4.0 liter engines. Finally, the design team needs to determine how much emphasis should be placed on two outputs: power (wPower) and torque (wTorque). For the sake of demonstration, we assume three instances where more weight is given to power, torque, and equal weight to both.Table 4summarizes the results of the output estimation obtained from the model (12). Three observations are worth noting. First, as expected, greater performance is required for bigger engine designs to attain the same level of efficiency. From a theoretical point of view, identified performance targets are all Pareto optima selected among a number of feasible solutions on the Pareto front via weight vectors assigned. Second, the system tradeoffs corresponding to the three different weight vectors can be seen in the ‘downsized’ scenario only. Specifically, there are no differences in estimated outputs between weights given to power and torque equally (5:5) and more to power (7:3) in ‘as-is’ and ‘upsized’ scenarios. This typifies the case of a weight vector not corresponding to a solution vector. In this instance, it can be inferred that the 3.5 liter engine design is subject to at least three different trade-off surfaces whereas the 3.8 and 4.0 liter engine designs reveal only two from the assigned weight vectors. Third, as seen in the column labeled post hoc test, efficiency scores from the estimated outputs end up being equal to the targeted efficiencies, further verifying the proposed method.In a similar sense, the second half of the Table 4 presents the results of the estimated performance targets that would make them efficient in 2018 (τ262^2018=1). Likewise, the system tradeoffs are shown but obviously this scenario demands higher performances to reach the estimated state-of-the-art frontier in 2018.
