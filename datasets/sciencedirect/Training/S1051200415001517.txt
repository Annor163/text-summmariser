@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we investigate the impacts of frequency increment errors on frequency diverse array (FDA) multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar in adaptive beamforming and target localization. Since a small frequency increment, as compared to the carrier frequency, is applied between the transmit elements, FDA MIMO radar offers a range-dependent transmit beampattern to suppress range-dependent interferences and thus yields better direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation performance than conventional MIMO radar. But the frequency increment errors will degrade FDA MIMO performance such as adaptive beamforming and target localization precision. In adaptive transmit beamforming analysis, we analyze the FDA MIMO radar beampattern mainlobe offset in range dimension, angle dimension and signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) performance under different frequency increment error cases. While for the target localization investigation, the performance analysis is based on an explicit expansion of the estimation error in the signal subspace and frequency increment error matrix. Simulation results show that the impacts of frequency increment errors are mainly on the range dimension, i.e., the range offset of mainlobe in beamforming and range estimation in target localization, especially for large frequency increment errors.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radar has received much attention in recent years. It employs multiple sensors to transmit orthogonal waveforms and receive echoes reflected by the targets. However, conventional MIMO radar has difficulty in distinguishing the targets and interferences that have the same angle but different ranges [1–3] by beamformers, and the localization performance will be significantly degraded [4,5].Frequency diverse array (FDA) radar was proposed to achieve range-dependent interference suppression and target localization [6–8]. Different from phased-array, a small frequency increment, as compared to the carrier frequency, is applied between the FDA elements [9]. This small frequency increment results in a range-angle-dependent beampattern [10,11]. The time and angle periodicity of FDA beampattern was analyzed in [12]. A linear FDA was proposed in [13] for forward-looking radar ground moving target indication. In [14], we have investigated the FDA Cramér–Rao lower bounds for estimating direction, range and velocity. The FDA beamforming and localization are proposed in [15–17]. Although FDA has drawn much attention in antenna and radar areas, existing literatures concentrate on FDA system design and little work about the joint applications of FDA and MIMO radars are reported [18–20]. Moreover, the impacts of frequency increment errors on FDA MIMO radar have not been investigated. In this paper, we investigate the FDA MIMO radar beamforming and localization in different frequency increment error cases.This work is based on the literatures [21,22], which analyzed the angle estimation performance of phased-array. Different from them, this work focuses on FDA, and analyzes the estimating performance of FDA with frequency increment errors. Furthermore, the estimated parameters are angle and range which are multiple parameters whereas only angle parameter is considered in [21,22]. This work also analyzes the impacts of frequency increment errors on FDA beamforming. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as following: (i) We analyzes the FDA MIMO radar mainlobe offset in FDA beamforming and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) degradation caused by frequency increment errors. (ii) The subspace-based localization performance of the FDA MIMO radar with frequency increment errors is also analyzed. (iii) We derive expressions of estimated error vector and root-mean-square of errors (RMSEs) of range and angle based on the subspace processing algorithms.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the FDA MIMO radar data model. Section 3 presents the effects of frequency increment errors on FDA MIMO radar adaptive beamforming method. In Section 4, multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm and Min-norm algorithm are employed for FDA MIMO radar target localization with frequency increment errors, and the RMSE expressions based on MUSIC algorithm and Min-norm algorithm are derived. Simulation results are provided in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.A standard MIMO radar involves omnidirectional transmission and the same carrier frequency from all transmit elements without forming a directional beam and steering vector dependent only on angle. Different from standard MIMO radar, a small frequency increment, compared to the carrier frequency, is used across the antenna elements on FDA MIMO radar transmit array, and its steering vector depends on both the range and angle. Consequently, consider an FDA MIMO radar with M co-located transmitting elements and N co-located receiving elements where each transmitting element sends out a waveforms(l),l=1,2,3,…,Lvia omnidirectional transmission, with L being the number of snapshot. Furthermore, different from conventional MIMO radar, the radiated frequency from each FDA MIMO radar transmit array element is(1)fm=f0+(m−1)Δf,m=1,2,3,…,Mwherefmis the radiation frequency of the mth element,f0is the FDA radar carrier frequency, Δf is the frequency diverse. However, due to non-perfected hardware devices, the actual radiated frequency is(2)f˜m=f0+(m−1)(Δf+Δρm),m=1,2,3,…,MwhereΔρmis the frequency increment error of the mth element.Taking the first element as the reference for the transmit array, when the signals arrive the targets locating at the angle θ and range r, the phase difference between two adjacent elements is [16](3)ϕ=2π(dλsin⁡θ−Δf˜cr),where λ denotes the center wavelength, c is the light velocity, d is space of two adjacent array elements, andΔf˜=Δf+Δρmstands for the frequency increment with error. Thereby, the FDA MIMO radar transmit steering vector is given by(4)a˜tt(θ,r)=[1,ejϕ,…,ej(m−1)ϕ,…,ej(M−1)ϕ]Twhere[⋅]Tdenotes transpose operator. The signal illuminated on the ith target or interference is(5)x˜tt(θi,ri)=∑m=1Ma˜ttm(θi,ri)s(l)=a˜tt1(θi,ri)s(l)+a˜tt2(θi,ri)s(l)+…+a˜ttm(θi,ri)s(l)+…+a˜ttM(θi,ri)s(l)=a˜ttT(θi,ri)[11⋮1]M×1s(l)=a˜ttT(θi,ri)[1M×1s(l)]=a˜ttT(θi,ri)[s(l)s(l)⋮s(l)]M×1=a˜ttT(θi,ri)s(l)where1M×1=[11⋮1]M×1denotes anM×1dimension vector whose elements are 1 anda˜ttm(θi,ri)denotes the mth element ofa˜tt(θ,r)(with the target location (θi,ri)), ands(l)=[s(l)s(l)…s(l)]Tdenotes anM×1signal vector with the same elements. It is worth noting that i is the index of target fori=0and denotes the index of interference wheni≥1in beamforming. Similarly, taking the first element as the reference for the co-located receiving array, the phase difference between two adjacent elements is [23](6)φ=2πdλsin⁡θ.And the receive steering vector is(7)ar(θ)=[1,ejφ,…,ej(n−1)φ,…,ej(N−1)φ]T.Note that, since theΔf˜cannot be referred to the signal by the receiving array, compared with transmitted steering vector, receiving steering vector is range-independent. More importantly, in the receiving signal, the phase differenceϕ˜1of transmitted steering vector becomes(8)ϕ˜=2π(dλsin⁡θ−Δf˜c2r).Therefore, the new transmitting steering vector at the receiving array is given by [23](9)a˜tr(θ,r)=[1,ejϕ˜,…,ej(m−1)ϕ˜,…,ej(M−1)ϕ˜]T.The baseband equivalent of the signals received at the N-element receiving array are given by(10)x˜=α0ar(θ0)x˜tr(θ0,r0)+∑i=1Iαiar(θi)x˜tr(θi,ri)+n=α0ar(θ0)a˜trT(θ0,r0)s(l)+∑i=1Iαiar(θi)a˜trT(θi,ri)s(l)+nwhereα0andαidenote the target and the ith interference reflection coefficients, andx˜tt(θi,ri)=a˜ttT(θi,ri)s(l)denotes the signal reflected by the ith interference (and similarly with target), andn(l)theN×1additive white Gaussian noise vector with zero mean and covariance matrixδn2I.The received signals pass down converter and are then processed by M passband filters, which outputs anM×Nmatrix given by(11)Y˜=α0ar(θ0)a˜trT(θ0,r0)s(l)+∑i=1Iαiar(θi)a˜trT(θi,ri)s(l)+Nwhere N denotes the noise results processed by M passband filters.We assume N contains independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian entries with zero mean and varianceσn2. Stacking the columns ofY˜leads to(12)y˜=Δvec(Y˜)=α0ar(θ0)a˜tr(θ0,r0)s(l)+∑i=1Iαiar(θi)a˜tr(θi,ri)s(l)+nwhere vec denotes the vectorization operator,n=Δvec(N)and(13)a˜(θ,r)=Δa˜tr(θ,r)⊗ar(θ)denotes the joint transmitting-receiving steering vector with ⊗ denoting Kronecker product. Unlike FDA radar and phased-array radar, the FDA MIMO radar provides no directional gain for the target located at (θ0,r0). Advantages of the latter include increased degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), better spatial resolution, and stronger capability of dealing with interferences.The interference-plus-noise covariance matrix for the MIMO radar can be expressed as(14)R˜=E{∑i=1Iσi2a˜(θi,ri)a˜H(θi,ri)s(l)+σn2I}whereσi2=αiαi⁎denotes the power of the ith interference with[⋅]⁎being the conjugate operator, andE{⋅}is the expected operator, and[⋅]His the transpose conjugate operator.When the MVDR beamforming method is employed with uniform Δf error, we can rewrite Eq. (9) as(15)a˜tr(η,Δρ)≐[1e−j2π(f0dsin⁡θc+(Δf+Δρ)dsin⁡θc−4(Δf+Δρ)rc)…e−j2π(M−1)(f0dsin⁡θc+(M−1)(Δf+Δρ)dsin⁡θc−4(Δf+Δρ)rc)]TDue toΔf≪f0andd≪r, compared with the terms of2π(m−1)f0dsin⁡θcand4π(m−1)(Δf+Δρ)rc,2π(m−1)2(Δf+Δρ)dsin⁡θcis so small that can be ignored [24]. Therefore, the mth element of transmit steering vector can be reformulated as(16)a˜trm(θ,r,Δρ)=e−j(2π(m−1)f0dsin⁡θc+2π(m−1)2(Δf+Δρ)dsin⁡θc−4π(m−1)(Δf+Δρ)rc)≈e−j(2π(m−1)f0dsin⁡θc−4π(m−1)(Δf+Δρ)rc)=e−j(2π(m−1)f0dsin⁡θc−4π(m−1)Δf(1+γ)rc)=e−j(2π(m−1)f0dsin⁡θc−4π(m−1)Δf(r+γr)c)=e−j(2π(m−1)f0dsin⁡θc−4π(m−1)Δf(r+Δr)c)whereΔr=γris the range error caused by uniform Δρ, andγ=Δρ/Δf. Eq. (16) indicates that when we obtain the practical phase difference of each element referred the first element, if range estimation is utilized by Δf, the estimated range isr+γr. However, the true range of target is r. So the frequency increment error will bring range estimation error γr. Furthermore, if the Δf error is uniform, then the range error will be its linear function.We further consider another case that the Δρs for all the elements are random. In this case, the frequency increments of all the FDA elements are a vector expressed as(17)Δf˜≐[Δf+Δρ1Δf+Δρ2…Δf+ΔρM]where the elements ofΔρ≐[Δρ1Δρ2…ΔρM]are stochastic process. The new transmit steering vector can be expressed as(18)a˜tr(θ,r,Δρ)=e−j2π(Mdsin⁡θλ−(M⊙Δf˜)2rc0)whereM=[01…M−1]is the index vector of array elements. For ideal MVDR beamformer, the adaptive weighting vector for the target located at(θ0,r0)is given by(19)w(θ0,r0)=R−1a(θ0,r0)aH(θ0,r0)R−1a(θ0,r0).Then the adaptive beampattern with Δρ is(20)P˜(θ,r,Δρ)=|a˜H(θ,r,Δρ)w(θ0,r0)|2where(21)a˜(θ,r,Δρ)=Δa˜tr(θ,r,Δρ)⊗ar(θ).The frequency increment error Δρ impacts the beampattern in two aspects: the FDA MIMO radar beampattern mainlobe offset and interference suppression performance degradation.Following the assumption that both of the target and noise are stochastic, the output SINR is(22)SINR=|a˜H(θ0,r0,Δρ)w(θ0,r0)|2wH(θ0,r0)R˜w(θ0,r0).Assume the frequency increment error Δρ of each elements is independent on each other, which can be expressed as the vectorΔρ. The transmit steering vector (18) can be reformulated as(23)a˜tr(θ,r,Δρ)=e−j2π(Mdsin⁡θλ−(M⊙Δf˜)2rc)=e−j2π(Mdsin⁡θλ−(MΔf)2rc−(M⊙Δρ)2rc)=e−j2π(Mdsin⁡θλ−(MΔf)2rc)⊙ej2π(M⊙Δρ)2rc=atr(θ,r)⊙Δatr(r,Δρ)whereatr(θ,r)=e−j2π(Mdsin⁡θλ−(MΔf)2rc)andΔatr(r,Δρ)=ej2π(M⊙Δρ)2rcstand for the ideal transmit steering vector and its error vector caused byΔρ, respectively. Using (23), (21) can be rewritten as(24)a˜(θ,r,Δρ)=(atr(θ,r)⊙Δatr(r,Δρ))⊗ar(θ)=(atr(θ,r)⊗ar(θ))⊙(Δatr(r,Δρ)⊗ar(θ))=a(θ,r)⊙Δa(θ,r,Δρ)wherea(θ,r)=atr(θ,r)⊗ar(θ)is the joint transmitting-receive steering vector without frequency increment errors, andΔa(θ,r,Δρ)=Δatr(r,Δρ)⊗ar(θ)denotes the joint transmitting-receive steering error vector caused byΔρ, and ⊙ denotes the Hadamard product. Here, we assume multiple targets signals impinge to the FDA MIMO receive array and none interferences signals are exiting. Due to small value ofΔρ, the output of the bandpass filter for FDA MIMO radar in Taylor series expansions is(25)y˜=∑kαka˜(θk,rk,Δρ)s(l)+n=∑kαka(θk,rk)⊙Δa(θk,rk,Δρ)s(l)+n=∑kαka(θk,rk)⊙(1+∑n=1∞[j2π(M⊙Δρ)r]nn!cn⊗ar(θk,rk,Δρ))s(l)+n≈∑kαka(θk,rk)⊙(1+j2π(M⊙Δρ)rc⊗ar(θk,rk,Δρ))s(l)+n=∑kαka(θk,rk)s(l)+∑kαk(a(θk,rk,Δρ)⊙Δb)s(l)+nwhere k is the index of targets, andΔb=j2π(M⊙Δρ)rc⊗ar(θk,rk,Δρ)is the error steering vector of FDA MIMO radar. Here the facteαx=1+∑n=1∞αnxnn!is utilized. Assumingn˜=n+∑kαk(a(θk,rk,Δρ)⊙Δb), (25) can be rewritten as(26)y˜=Δ∑kαka(θk,rk)s(l)+n˜.The covariance matrix ofy˜is:(27)R˜y=E{y˜y˜H}=A˜(θ,r)(Λ000)A˜(θ,r)H+σn2I=(U˜A⋮U˜n)(Λ+σK2I00σM−K2I)(U˜A⋮U˜n)HwhereA˜(θ,r)=[a˜(θ1,r1),a˜(θ2,r2),…,a˜(θK,rK)]Tis the receive steering matrix of multiple signals, in which K is the number of targets, andU˜AandU˜nare the unitary matrixes of signal and noise subspaces, respectively. The rank ofΛ+σK2Iis the number of targets.To clearly analyze the errors caused byΔρ, singular value decomposition is performed on R:(28)R=A(θ,r)(Λ000)A(θ,r)H+σn2I=(UA⋮Un)(Λ+σK2I00σM−K2I)(UA⋮Un)H.Denote(29)U˜A=UA+ΔUA,andU˜n=Un+ΔUnwhereΔUAandΔUnare the perturbations in phase for the estimated orthogonal and signal subspaces caused byΔρand noise. Assume the noise power is very small, and for smallΔρ, the first-order perturbation expansion can be used to get a linear approximation to the perturbed subspaces in phase.The MUSIC spectra can be expressed as(30)PMUSIC(θ˜,r˜)=aH(θ,r)U˜nU˜nHa(θ,r)whereθ˜=θ˜kandr˜=r˜k. The functionP(θ˜,r˜)will have a null value, namely,PMUSIC(θ˜k,r˜k)=0.For Min-norm algorithm, we partition the noise-subspace as(31)U˜n=(c˜HU˜0)wherec˜His the first row andU˜0are the rest rows ofU˜n. Then the prediction-error vector can be expressed as(32)d˜=U˜nc˜‖c˜‖=defU˜nc¯˜wherec¯˜=c˜‖c˜‖and‖⋅‖denotes Euclidean vector norm. Using (32), this spectrum can be alternatively expressed as(33)Pmin-norm(θ˜,r˜)=|a(θ,r)d˜|2=a(θ,r)U˜nc¯˜c¯˜HU˜nHa(θ,r).Compared (30) and (33), two equations can be rewritten as the same form(34)P(θ˜,r˜)=a(θ,r)U˜nW˜U˜nHa(θ,r).For MUSIC algorithm, the weighting matrix is the identity matrix, i.e.,W˜=I. For Min-Norm, the weighting matrix is a data-dependent rank 1 matrix, namely,W˜=c¯˜c¯˜H.Due to Δρs and noise in the data, an algorithm will obtain an estimateθ˜kandr˜kwhich will have errorΔθk. That is,(35)θ˜k=θk+Δθk,andr˜k=rk+Δrkwhere theΔθkandΔrkare estimated angle and range perturbations of the kth target caused by Δρ mainly, respectively. Definingη=[θ,r]T, (35) can be reformulated as(36)η˜k=ηk+Δηk.Taylor series expansions with respect to the true angle and range of target localization at smallΔρvalue are performed on the null spectrum function as follows [22](37)∂P(η˜k,U˜n)∂η=∂P(ηk,U˜n)∂η+∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂η2Δηkwhere(38)∂P(ηk,U˜n)∂η=[∂P(ηk,U˜n)∂θ∂P(ηk,U˜n)∂r]T(39)∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂η2=[∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂θ2∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂θ∂r∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂r∂θ∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂r2].The first- and second-order partial derivatives ofP(ηk,Un)with respect to θ and r are computed, respectively, as(40)−∂P(ηk,U˜n)∂θ=Nθ(ηk,U˜n)=−aθ(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHa(ηk)−a(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHaθ(ηk)(41)−∂P(ηk,U˜n)∂r=Nr(ηk,U˜n)=−ar(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHa(ηk)−a(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHar(ηk)and(42)∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂θ2=Dθθ(ηk,U˜n)=aθθ(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHa(ηk)+2aθ(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHaθ(ηk)+a(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHaθθ(ηk)(43)∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂θ∂r=∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂r∂θ=Dθr(ηk,U˜n)=aθr(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHa(ηk)+2aθ(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHar(ηk)+a(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHaθr(ηk)(44)∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂r2=Drr(ηk,U˜n)=arr(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHa(ηk)+2ar(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHar(ηk)+a(ηk)HU˜nW˜U˜nHarr(ηk)whereaθ(ηk)andar(ηk)stand for the first order partial derivatives ofa(ηk)with respect to θ and r, respectively, andaθθ(ηk),aθr(ηk)andarr(ηk)denote the second order partial derivatives ofa(ηk).Let the left-hand side of Eq. (37) equals zero,η˜kcan be solved from (38)–(44) as follows(45)Δηk=−(∂2P(ηk,U˜n)∂η2)−1∂P(ηk,U˜n)∂η=−D−1(ηk,U˜n)N(ηk,U˜n),k=1,2,…K.We now approximateD(ηk,U˜n)andN(ηk,U˜n)ofΔηkby first-order perturbation expressions inΔUn, shown as(46)N(ηk,U˜n)≈N(ηk,Un)+ΔN(ηk,U˜n)(47)D(ηk,U˜n)≈D(ηk,Un)+ΔD(ηk,U˜n).N(ηk,U˜n)andD(ηk,U˜n)are linear functions ofΔN(ηk,U˜n)andΔD(ηk,U˜n). Using the fact thataH(ηk)Un≈0, we have that(48)N(η,Un)≈[0,0]Tand(49)Dθθ(ηk,Un)≈2aθ(ηk)HUnWUnHaθ(ηk)(50)Dθr(ηk,Un)≈2aθ(ηk)HUnWUnHar(ηk)(51)Drr(ηk,Un)≈2ar(ηk)HUnWUnHar(ηk).Using (46)–(51), (45) can be reformulated as(52)Δηk=−D−1(ηk,U˜n)N(ηk,U˜n)=−(D(ηk,Un)+ΔD(ηk,U˜n))−1(N(ηk,Un)+ΔN(ηk,U˜n))≈−(D(ηk,Un)+ΔD(ηk,U˜n))−1ΔN(ηk,U˜n)=−(I+ΔD(ηk,U˜n)D−1(ηk,Un))−1D−1ΔN(ηk,U˜n)≈−(I−ΔD(ηk,U˜n)D−1(ηk,Un))D−1ΔN(ηk,U˜n).The fact(53)(I+ΔD(ηk,U˜n)D−1(ηk,Un))−1=I−ΔD(ηk,U˜n)D−1(ηk,Un)+…(Taylor series of the matrix) is utilized, here. Consequently, keeping only the first-order perturbation yields, (52) can be recast to(54)Δηk=−(I−ΔD(ηk,U˜n)D−1(ηk,Un))D−1ΔN(ηk,U˜n)≈−D(ηk,Un)−1ΔN(ηk,U˜n).To calculateΔN, we note thatW˜could be a linear function ofU˜n(as in Min-Norm), and so perturbations inU˜ninduce perturbations inW˜. We approximate the perturbed by a first-order perturbation series as(55)W˜=W+ΔWwhere W is evaluated atUn, andΔWis a linear function ofΔUn. Now, according to (40) and (41), we can obtain(56)Nθ(ηk,U˜n)=Nθ(ηk,Un+ΔUn)=−aθ(ηk)H(Un+ΔUn)(W+ΔW)(Un+ΔUn)Ha(ηk)−a(ηk)H(Un+ΔUn)(W+ΔW)(Un+ΔUn)Haθ(ηk)=Nθ(ηk,Un)+Tθ1+Tθ2+Tθ3=Tθ1+Tθ2+Tθ3and(57)Nr(ηk,U˜n)=Nr(ηk,Un+ΔUn)=−ar(ηk)H(Un+ΔUn)(W+ΔW)(Un+ΔUn)Ha(ηk)−a(ηk)H(Un+ΔUn)(W+ΔW)(Un+ΔUn)Har(ηk)=Nr(ηk,Un)+Tr1+Tr2+Tr3=Tr1+Tr2+Tr3whereTθ1andTr1represent terms in whichΔUnappears once,Tθ2andTr2represent terms in whichΔUnappears twice, andTθ3andTr3represent terms in whichΔUnappears three times. For a first-order perturbation analysis, we ignore the terms inTθ2,Tr2,Tθ3andTr3and only consider the terms inTθ1andTr1. Most of these terms are zero when calculated atηksince they contain the factorar(ηk)HUn. In particular, all terms inTθ1andTr1containingΔWare zero atηk. Since the nominal term in (56) and (57) are zero, terms inTθ1andTr1are the first-order perturbationΔNθandΔNrthat we are looking for, respectively. Therefore, we can get(58)ΔNθ(ηk,U˜n)=−aθ(ηk)HUnWΔUnHa(ηk)−a(ηk)HΔUnWUnHaθ(ηk)=−2Re[a(ηk)HΔUnWUnHaθ(ηk)]and(59)ΔNr(ηk,U˜n)=−ar(ηk)HUnWΔUnHa(ηk)−a(ηk)HΔUnWUnHar(ηk)=−2Re[a(ηk)HΔUnWUnHar(ηk)]where Re denote real part. According to [21], it can be known that(60)ΔUn=−UA(Λ+σK2I)−1UAHNUnwhere N is error matrix.All the unknown parameters are obtained, according to Eq. (54), the errors of estimated parameters are calculated as(61)Δηk=−D(ηk,Un)−1ΔN(ηk,U˜n)=−[Dθθ(ηk,Un)Dθr(ηk,Un)Dθr(ηk,Un)Drr(ηk,Un)]−1[ΔNθ(ηk,U˜n)ΔNr(ηk,U˜n)]=−[Drr(ηk,Un)Dθθ(ηk,Un)Drr(ηk,Un)−Dθr2(ηk,Un)−Dθr(ηk,Un)Dθθ(ηk,Un)Drr(ηk,Un)−Dθr2−Dθr(ηk,Un)Dθθ(ηk,Un)Drr(ηk,Un)−Dθr2(ηk,Un)DθθDθθ(ηk,Un)Drr(ηk,Un)−Dθr2(ηk,Un)][ΔNθ(ηk,U˜n)ΔNr(ηk,U˜n)].SinceΔηk=[ΔθkΔrk]T, we can get that(62)Δθk=−Drr(ηk,Un)ΔNθ(ηk,U˜n)−Dθr(ηk,Un)ΔNr(ηk,U˜n)Drr(ηk,Un)Dθθ(ηk,Un)−Dθr2(ηk,Un)=−ΔNθ(ηk,U˜n)−Dθr(ηk,Un)ΔNr(ηk,U˜n)/Drr(ηk,Un)Dθθ(ηk,Un)−Dθr2(ηk,Un)/Drr(ηk,Un)(63)Δrk=−Dθθ(ηk,Un)ΔNr(ηk,U˜n)−Dθr(ηk,Un)ΔNθ(ηk,U˜n)Drr(ηk,Un)Dθθ(ηk,Un)−Dθr2(ηk,Un)=−ΔNr(ηk,U˜n)−Dθr(ηk,Un)ΔNθ(ηk,U˜n)/Dθθ(ηk,Un)Drr(ηk,Un)−Dθr2(ηk,Un)/Dθθ(ηk,Un).Due to θ and r being scalars, the variances of two parameters can be expressed as(64)var(Δθk)=cov(Δθk)and(65)var(Δrk)=cov(Δrk)wherevar(⋅)denotes the variance operator andcov(⋅)denotes the covariance operator. In the next section, we only derive the covariance of parameter Δr, and Δθ has the same derivation procedure. Using Eqs. (60), and (64), (65) can be written as(66)cov(Δrk)=cov(−ΔNr(ηk,U˜n)−Dθr(ηk,Un)ΔNθ(ηk,U˜n)/Dθθ(ηk,Un)Drr(ηk,Un)−Dθr2(ηk,Un)/Dθθ(ηk,Un))=cov(2Re[a(ηk)HΔUnWUnHar(ηk)]−2βRe[a(ηk)HΔUnWUnHaθ(ηk)]γ)=cov(2Re[a(ηk)HΔUnWUnH(ar(ηk)−βaθ(ηk))]γ)=cov(2Re[a(ηk)HUA(Λ+σK2I)−1UAHNUnWUnH(ar(ηk)−βaθ(ηk))]γ)whereγ=Drr(ηk,Un)−Dθr2(ηk,Un)/Dθθ(ηk,Un)andβ=Dθr(ηk,Un)/Dθθ(ηk,Un)are simplified notation. Using the fact that(67)vec(ABC)=CT⊗Avec(B)we can get(68)a(ηk)HUA(Λ+σK2I)−1UAHNUnWUnH(ar(ηk)−βaθ(ηk))=(UnWUnH(ar(ηk)−βaθ(ηk)))T⊗(a(ηk)HUA(Λ+σK2I)−1UAH)vec(N).And we define thatt=(UnWUnH(ar(ηk)−βaθ(ηk)))T⊗(a(ηk)HUA(Λ+σK2I)−1UAH)andΔu=vec(N), (66) can be rewritten as(69)cov(Δrk)=4γ2cov(Re[tΔu]).Utilizing the fact that(70)cov(Re{A})=E(Re{A}Re{A}H)−E(Re{A})2=12Re{E(AAH+AAT)}−E(Re{A})2(69) can be rewritten as(71)cov(Δrk)=4γ2E{Re[tΔu]Re[tΔu]H}−4γ2E{Re[tΔu]}2=4γ2E{Re[tΔu]Re[tΔu]H}−4γ2E{Re[tΔu]}2=2γ2Re(E{tΔuΔuHtH}+E{tΔuΔuTtT})−4γ2E{Re[tΔu]}2=2γ2Re(tE{ΔuΔuH}tH+tE{ΔuΔuT}tT)−4γ2Re[E{tΔu}]2.If there is no frequency increment error, and the noise obeys Gaussian distribution with zero mean, (70) will be reformulated as [21](72)cov(Δrk)=2γ2Re[E{[tΔu][tΔu]H}]=2γ2Re[tE{ΔuΔuH}tH]=2σn2γ2Re[ttH].Generally, the frequency increment errors are much larger than the noise, and the noise term can be ignored, so we only calculate the mean of non-zero value ofΔuintE{ΔuΔuH}tH+tE{ΔuΔuT}tTandE{tΔu}. Assume the mth frequency increment errorΔρmis Gaussian distribution, namely,Δρm∼N(0,σΔρ2). Using the factE{tΔu}=tE{Δu}and to calculateE{Δu}, we need to calculate the expected value of every element ofΔu,(73)E{Δu}=∫−∞∞j2π(m−1)Δρmrkce−j2πdλ(m+n−2)sin⁡θk+j2π(m−1)Δρmrkc12πσΔρe−Δρm22σΔρ2dΔρm=Γmn∫−∞∞ΔρmeξmΔρm12πσΔρe−Δρm22σΔρ2dΔρm=Γmn∫−∞∞Δρm12πσΔρe−Δρm2−2σΔρ2ξmΔρm+σΔρ4ξm22σΔρ2eσΔρ2ξm22dΔρm=ΓmneσΔρm2ξm22σΔρ2ξmwhereΓmn=j2π(m−1)rkce−j2πdλ(m+n−2)sin⁡θkandξm=j2πrkc(m−1), and Δu is one element ofΔu. Since the frequency increment errors are independent between different elements of FDA radar, when Δρs of the entries inΔuΔuHcome from different FDA transmit elements, we can get that(74a)E{ΔutΔul}=E{Δut}E{Δul}(74b)E{ΔutΔul⁎}=E{Δut}E{Δul⁎}where t and l denote the element indexes ofΔu, and[⋅]⁎represents for conjugate operator.

Similarly, we also can derive the variance ofΔθkas the procedure above. Therefore, the RMSEs of two parameters can be expressed as(77)RMSE(Δθk)=var(Δθk)and(78)RMSE(Δrk)=var(Δrk).Suppose the following simulation parameters:M=N=8,f0=10GHz,d=λ/2andΔf=30KHz. The additive noise is modeled as complex Gaussian zero-mean spatially and temporally white random sequences that have identical variance in the array sensors.Example 1Adaptive beamforming and performance analysisIn the first example, one target and multiple interferences are supposed to reflect the plane-waves that impinge on the array from the locations of(θs,rs)=(10∘,10km)and(θj,rj)=(10°,7–9km), respectively.SINR=10dBis used in the simulations.Fig. 1gives the comparative adaptive beampatterns for FDA MIMO radar withΔρ=0HzandΔρ=1000Hzin range dimension and angle dimension. In this case, the frequency increment errors are uniform, i.e., the radiated frequency from the mth elements isf˜m(wheref˜m=f0+(m−1)(Δf+Δρ)). Obviously, the frequency increment error Δρ results in the beampattern mainlobe offset for FDA MIMO radar in range dimension as shown in Fig. 1(a), but it doesn't affect the FDA MIMO radar mainlobe in angle dimension, as shown in Fig. 1(b).Fig. 2shows the RMSEs of FDA MIMO mainlobe offset in two dimensions. Note that the RMSEs are computed based on 500 independent Monte-Carlo runs and refer the true value of target location as the mean value. Furthermore, two cases are considered in RMSE simulation. One is that the Δρ is uniform, which is mentioned above, and the other one is that the Δρ in each element of transmit antenna array is stochastic,Δρm∼N(0,Δρ2). For both of the cases, the larger Δρ value causes more sufficient mainlobe offset in range dimension, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Furthermore, it can be noticed that the RMSE for the stochastic Δρ has a much smaller value as compared with the uniform case. However, from the Fig. 2(b), we can see that the RMSEs for the stochastic error are smaller for the smaller Δρ value in the angle dimension, which is much flatter compared with range dimension. Note that, the RMSE for uniform case is periodic in angle dimension, which is caused by the relationship of angle and range. In general, the mainlobe suffered from angle offset is not so severely as in range dimension.We also examined the adaptive beamformer output SINR versus Δρ, as shown in Fig. 3. In this case, we assume that the target and interferences have the same angle but different ranges. It can be observed that the SINR has the maximum value when Δρ almost equals to zero, and degrades as the Δρ value is becoming to larger. Note that the zigzag points on the SINR curve are caused by noise.Example 2Localization and performance analysisConsider the target coming from the locations (10°, 10 km), and the SNR is fixed to 10 dB. The array parameters and the uniform and stochastic Δρ are the same to adaptive beamforming.The RMSEs versus Δρ are demonstrated in Fig. 4which are based on the MUSIC algorithm. In the random case, all theΔρms in FDA elements are Gaussian distribution, i.e.,Δρm∼(0,Δρ2). From the Fig. 4(a), it can be obviously seen that the estimated range are biased under both uniform and stochastic Δρ cases, and the bias increases with the Δρ becoming larger which is the same as the beampattern mainlobe offset mentioned above. However, the offset for the stochastic frequency increment error case is better than that of uniform case. Obviously, the frequency increment error works badly, as shown in the Fig. 4(a). Assume maximum tolerating range error is 100 m for a far distance target. For uniform frequency increment errors, Δρ value must limit to be no more than 100 Hz. While for the random frequency increment errors, that becomes no larger 500 Hz, which is five times that of uniform case. This is a good phenomenon for most stochastic frequency increment errors. Inversely, the estimated angle is not sufficiently effected by Δρ, as shown in Fig. 4(b). In uniform Δρ case, the estimated angle error almost equals to zero, i.e., none estimated angle error caused by Δρ. However, there are angle estimation errors in the case of stochastic Δρ. Furthermore, the angle error estimate performance degrades as Δρ increases. In general, the frequency increment errors have a small effect on the angle estimation for FDA MIMO radar. The angle accuracy is smaller than 0.4°, when the frequency increment error is smaller than 700 Hz.Compared with Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), it can be known that the estimation performances for range and angle are opposite when given different types of Δρ. In Fig. 4(a), the performance of stochastic Δρs are better than that of the uniform case, whereas in Fig. 4(b), opposite result is achieved for angle estimation. For range estimation, the average of frequency increment errors in uniform case is larger than that of random case. The larger frequency increment errors will cause larger range error. Therefore, the random frequency increment errors have a better performance. For angle estimation, the uniform frequency increment errors can be considered as a part of frequency increment. Thus Eq. (16) can be viewed as an ideal FDA steering vector. If we utilize the actual frequency increment error to estimate the range, the uniform frequency increment errors will result in range error, and not affect the angle estimated. Therefore, there are no errors for angle estimation in the uniform case. However, the random frequency increment errors caused random phase errors in FDA steering vector. The random phase error can not only affect the range estimation, but also the angle estimation.Furthermore, the performance analysis based on MUSIC algorithm and Min-norm algorithm versusσΔρis demonstrated in Fig. 5. Note that the simulations are based on 500 independent Monte Carlo runs. Fig. 5(a) shows comparison between empirical RMSEs and theoretical RMSEs in range dimension. It can be seen that the estimated range deviations are almost same based on two algorithms whenσΔρhave smaller value, and the bias increases with theσΔρbecoming larger. WhenσΔρbecomes larger, Min-norm algorithm outperforms MUSIC algorithm. In angle dimension, the second term of Eq. (26) is considered as random noise, so the increasing rate of RMSE becomes small asσΔρs have enough large value and the simulation results are not matched the theoretical prediction. We don't give the theoretical results here. Furthermore, from Fig. 5(b) we can know that the performance of MUSIC is much better than that of Min-norm. Due to the frequency increment errors which cause the phase noise, MUSIC has more orthogonal vectors to suppress the phase noise. At last, we give the RMSE simulation results about MUSIC algorithm and Min-norm algorithm with no frequency increment errors. In this case, the estimated results are affected by noise shown as shown in Fig. 6. Both of the figures show that the theoretical derivation agrees closely with empirical results.
