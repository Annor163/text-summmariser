We provide a simple, efficient technique for computing μ-bases for quadric surfaces from their rational quadratic parametrizations. Our major innovation is to simplify the computations by using complex parameters, even though all the surfaces we treat have only real coefficients in both their implicit and parametric representations. In addition to the theory, we provide several examples to illustrate our method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
μ-Bases are a powerful tool for analyzing the algebraic and geometric properties of rational curves and surfaces. For example, μ-bases for rational planar curves can be used to easily retrieve both the implicit and parametric equations of these curves as well as to locate and analyze their singular points (Chen and Wang, 2003a; Chen et al., 2008; Jia and Goldman, 2009, 2012).Straightforward, efficient techniques are known for computing μ-bases for rational curves of arbitrary degree in arbitrary dimensions (Song and Goldman, 2009), but computing μ-bases for rational surfaces of arbitrary degree in just 3-dimensions is, in general, notoriously difficult (Chen et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2005). Currently the only exception to this seemingly intractable problem for high degree surfaces is constructing μ-bases for rational ruled surfaces from parametrizations of bidegree(1,n), which essentially can be reduced to computing μ-bases for rational curves (Chen and Wang, 2003b; Chen et al., 2001).In contrast, for surfaces in 3-dimensions with rational quadratic parametrizations there do exist straightforward techniques for finding a μ-basis. A method for computing μ-bases for quadric surfaces with rational quadratic representations is presented in Chen et al. (2007). The construction involves solving two systems of linear equations, each with 12 unknowns, to generate three moving planes that follow the surface. The implicit, parametric, and inversion equations for the surface can all be retrieved from these three moving planes. Analogous techniques for finding μ-bases for cubic and quartic surfaces with rational quadratic parametrizations are presented in Wang et al. (2008), Wang and Chen (2012).Here we shall concentrate on developing novel, efficient methods for computing μ-bases for non-ruled quadric surfaces. The non-degenerate quadric surfaces in affine space can be grouped into seven distinct types: ellipsoids, elliptical paraboloids, hyperbolic paraboloids, hyperboloids of one and two sheets, elliptical cones, and cylinders over conic sections. The cylinders, cones, hyperbolic paraboloids, and hyperboloids of one sheet are ruled surfaces. Thus we are left with three distinct types of non-ruled quadric surfaces: ellipsoids, elliptical paraboloids, and hyperboloids of two sheets.The primary goal of this paper is to provide a simple, efficient technique for computing μ-bases for these three types of non-ruled quadric surfaces — the ellipsoids (including spheres), elliptical paraboloids, and hyperboloids of two sheets — from their rational quadratic parametrizations. We shall then use these μ-bases to compute the implicit equation and inversion formulas for these non-ruled quadric surfaces. We shall see too that our method also works for finding the implicit equation for the ruled quadric surfaces from their rational quadratic parametrizations. Our major innovation is to allow complex parameters in these computations, even though all the surfaces we treat have only real coefficients in both their implicit and parametric representations. Using complex parameters allows us to solve fewer equations with fewer unknowns thanChen et al. (2007). The motivation for using complex parameters is that quadric surfaces that are not ruled in real affine space are nonetheless ruled in complex projective space (Pedoe, 1988).This paper is structured in the following fashion. In Section 2 we review the notion of μ-bases for rational curves and surfaces. We explain our method and why it works in Section 3, and we provide examples of our techniques in action for both non-ruled and ruled quadric surfaces in Section 4. We close in Section 5 with some observations about the strengths and weaknesses of our method.To fix our notation and terminology, we shall briefly review here the notions of syzygies, moving lines, moving planes, and μ-bases for rational curves and surfaces.LetP(t)=(x(t),y(t),w(t))be a rational planar curve in homogeneous form. A syzygy ofP(t)consists of a 3-tuple of polynomialsL(t)=(l1(t),l2(t),l3(t))such thatL(t)⋅P(t)=l1(t)x(t)+l2(t)y(t)+l3(t)w(t)≡0.WhenL(t)is a syzygy ofP(t), we say that the expressionl1(t)x+l2(t)y+l3(t)w=0is a moving line that follows the curveP(t).The collection of syzygies for a rational curveP(t)is known to form a free module with two generators over the ring of polynomials in t (Cox et al., 1998). A μ-basis forP(t)is a basisu(t),v(t)of lowest degree for the syzygy module ofP(t).μ-Basesu(t),v(t)for rational planar curvesP(t)are known to have the following three important properties (Chen and Wang, 2003a):1)deg(u(t))+deg(v(t))=deg(P(t)).u(t)×v(t)=λP(t)for some nonzero constant λ.f(x,y,w)≡Rest(u(t)⋅(x,y,w),v(t)⋅(x,y,w))=0is the implicit equation ofP(t).Analogously, letP(s,t)=(x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t),w(s,t))be a rational surface in homogeneous form. A syzygy ofP(s,t)consists of a 4-tuple of polynomialsL(s,t)=(l1(s,t),l2(s,t),l3(s,t),l4(s,t))such thatL(s,t)⋅P(s,t)=l1(s,t)x(s,t)+l2(s,t)y(s,t)+l3(s,t)z(s,t)+l4(s,t)w(s,t)≡0.WhenL(s,t)is a syzygy ofP(s,t), we say that the expressionl1(s,t)x+l2(s,t)y+l3(s,t)z+l4(s,t)w=0is a moving plane that follows the surfaceP(s,t).The collection of syzygies for a rational surfaceP(s,t)is known to form a free module with three generators over the ring of polynomials in(s,t)(Chen et al., 2005). However, unlike for polynomials in one variable, in general there is no obvious notion of lowest degree for polynomials in two variables. Therefore, a μ-basis forP(s,t)is defined to be just any basisp(s,t),q(s,t),r(s,t)for the syzygy module ofP(s,t). In analogy with μ-bases for curves, any μ-basisp(s,t),q(s,t),r(s,t)for the syzygy module ofP(s,t)satisfies[p(s,t),q(s,t),r(s,t)]=λP(s,t)for some constantλ≠0(Chen et al., 2005). Here the outer product[p,q,r]of three vectorsp,q,rin 4-dimensions is the 4-tuple defined by setting[p,q,r]=(|p2p3p4q2q3q4r2r3r4|,−|p1p3p4q1q3q4r1r3r4|,|p1p2p4q1q2q4r1r2r4|,−|p1p2p3q1q2q3r1r2r3|).Notice that[p,q,r]=det⁡(ijklp1p2p3p4q1q2q3q4r1r2r3r4),wherei,j,k,lare the unit vectors along the coordinate axes. Thus this outer product is the analogue in 4-dimensions of the cross product in 3-dimensions, since[p,q,r]⊥p,q,r.Quadric surfaces with rational quadratic parametrizations are the simplest non-planar rational surfaces. One of the primary goals of this paper is to construct a pair of complex syzygiesu(s,t)=p(s,t)+q(s,t)i,v(s,t)=m(s,t)+n(s,t)ifor non-ruled quadric surfaces that, in analogy with rational planar curves, have the following three properties:1)deg⁡(u(s,t))+deg⁡(v(s,t))=deg⁡(P(s,t)). (Here deg refers to total degree.)A real μ-basisp˜(s,t),q˜(s,t),r˜(s,t)forP(s,t)can be generated from linear combinations of the syzygiesp(s,t),q(s,t),m(s,t),n(s,t)so that[p˜(s,t),q˜(s,t),r˜(s,t)]=P(s,t).The implicit equation ofP(s,t)isf(x,y,z,w)≡Ress,t(u(s,t)⋅(x,y,z,w),v(s,t)⋅(x,y,z,w))=0.The complex syzygiesu(s,t),v(s,t)are not a basis for the syzygy module ofP(s,t), but as we have just seen these two syzygies do possess several of the desirable properties of a μ-basis. Moreover their real and imaginary partsp(s,t),q(s,t),m(s,t),n(s,t)generate this syzygy module. So we can think of the pairu(s,t),v(s,t)as the complex analogue of a μ-basis and therefore we shall abuse terminology and call the complex syzygiesu(s,t),v(s,t)a complex μ-basis forP(s,t).A μ-basis for ruled surfaces can be constructed from two moving planes that follow the surface, since the intersection of two moving planes that follow a surface is a moving line that lies on the surface. Our problem is that in real affine space the ellipsoid, the elliptical paraboloid, and the hyperboloid of two sheets are not ruled. Nevertheless, and this is the key insight, all quadric surfaces are ruled surfaces in complex projective space. Therefore to construct these non-ruled quadric surfaces from two moving planes, we need to invoke complex parameters.Consider then a moving plane(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(αs+βt+γ)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(ρs+σt+τ)that follows a quadric surface with a rational quadratic parametrization. We have 14 free parametersA,B,C,D,E,F,G,Handα,β,γ,ρ,σ,τ. For this moving plane to follow a rational quadratic parametrizationP(s,t)=(x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t),w(s,t)),these parameters must be chosen to satisfy the identity(Ax(s,t)+By(s,t)+Cz(s,t)+Dw(s,t))(αs+βt+γ)+(Ex(s,t)+Fy(s,t)+Gz(s,t)+Hw(s,t))(ρs+σt+τ)≡0.This equation leads to 10 conditions: the coefficient of all the monomials up to degree 3 must vanish. These constraints are non-linear, so the solutions are, in general, complex numbers. We could solve these 10 non-linear equations in 14 unknowns, but there is a simpler way.Quadric surfacesP(s,t)=(x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t),w(s,t))with rational quadratic parametrizations always have two base points — that is, parameter values(s⁎,t⁎)wherex(s⁎,t⁎)=y(s⁎,t⁎)=z(s⁎,t⁎)=w(s⁎,t⁎)=0.These base points can sometimes be identified by inspection, but in any event can always be computed by Groebner bases or resultants, and the computation is fast since we are dealing here with only 4 polynomials of degree 2 in 2 variables.At the parameter value(s,t)where the two linesαs+βt+γ=0andρs+σt+τ=0intersect, the moving plane(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(αs+βt+γ)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(ρs+σt+τ)vanishes identically independent of the choice of the coefficientsA,B,C,D,E,F,G,H. Therefore it is natural to choose the common solution ofαs+βt+γ=0andρs+σt+τ=0to be located at a base point of the parametrization. (This idea is also suggested in a more general setting by Zheng et al., 2003.)Now let(s1,t1)and(s2,t2)be the two base points of the quadric surfaceP(s,t)=(x(s,t),y(s,t),z(s,t),w(s,t)), and consider the polynomial(1)Φ(s,t)=Γ1(s,t)ϕ(s,t)+Γ2(s,t)ψ(s,t),whereΓ1(s,t)=Ax(s,t)+By(s,t)+Cz(s,t)+Dw(s,t)Γ2(s,t)=Ex(s,t)+Fy(s,t)+Gz(s,t)+Hw(s,t)ϕ(s,t)=αs+βt+γψ(s,t)=ρs+σt+τ.SinceP(s,t)vanishes at the base points(2)Γ1(s1,t1)=Γ2(s2,t2)=0,so(3)Φ(s1,t1)=0(4)Φ(s2,t2)=0Moreover, since we have chosenϕ(s,t)andψ(s,t)so thatϕ(s1,t1)=ψ(s1,t1)=0, it follows from (1) and (3) that the first order partial derivatives ofΦ(s,t)also vanish at(s1,t1)— that is,(5)Φ(1,0)(s1,t1)=0(6)Φ(0,1)(s1,t1)=0Equations (3)–(6) are four conditions already satisfied for any choice of the 8 parametersA,B,C,D,E,F,G,H, so of the 10 initial constraints on these coefficients (the vanishing of the coefficients of the cubic monomials), only at most 6 constraints are independent. Therefore there are always at least two independent solutions for the moving plane(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(αs+βt+γ)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(ρs+σt+τ)that follows a quadric surfaceP(s,t). Moreover, we can now find the 8 parametersA,B,C,D,E,F,G,Hsimply by solving linear equations. Notice that since the base points may be located at complex parameters, the coefficientsA,B,C,D,E,F,G,Hmay also be complex numbers.Now consider two solutions:(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(αs+βt+γ)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(ρs+σt+τ)(Aˆx+Bˆy+Cˆz+Dˆw)(αs+βt+γ)+(Eˆx+Fˆy+Gˆz+Hˆw)(ρs+σt+τ)that follow the surfaceP(s,t). Since these moving planes follow the surfacedet⁡(Ax+By+Cz+DwEx+Fy+Gz+HwAˆx+Bˆy+Cˆz+DˆwEˆx+Fˆy+Gˆz+Hˆw)must vanish on the surface. Thus this determinant is either identically zero or this determinant represents the implicit equation of the quadric surface. We shall see in Section 4 that this determinant does indeed represent the implicit equation of the quadric surface, even though the quadric surface may have only real coefficients and some of the parametersA,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,Aˆ,Bˆ,Cˆ,Dˆ,Eˆ,Fˆ,Gˆ,Hˆmay be complex numbers.We can also recover the parametric equations of the surface from these two moving planes. Since these moving planes are complex valued, each moving plane splits into one real and one imaginary moving plane that must also follow the surface. In this way we actually generate four real moving planes that follow the surface. Since each of these moving planes is orthogonal to the surface, only three of these moving planes can be independent. Moreover the outer product of any three linear combinations of these moving planes must be orthogonal to each of the constituent moving planes and therefore parallel to the parametrization of the quadric surface. Thus we can recover the parametrization of the quadric surface from the outer product of three of these moving planes.Finally, this method can also be applied to find inversion formulas for the parameters(s,t)in terms of rational quadratic expressions in the coordinatesx,y,z,wsimply by solving the two linear equations ins,tgenerated by the real and imaginary parts of one of the two moving planes — for example, by solving the following two linear equations ins,t:Re[(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(αs+βt+γ)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(ρs+σt+τ)]=0Im[(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(αs+βt+γ)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(ρs+σt+τ)]=0We shall now provide examples to flesh out our methods. In these examples we use homogeneous parametrizations with homogeneous parameters(s,t,u), since the base points of these parametrizations often occur at infinity (i.e. whereu=0). But we must take special care when using homogeneous parameters because the syzygy module of the homogeneous parametrization of a rational surface is not a free module. Therefore when we want to retrieve the parametrization from the μ-basis, we need to dehomogenize both the μ-basis and the parametrization.To show how to find a complex μ-basis for a non-ruled quadric surface and how to use this complex μ-basis to recover the implicit, parametric and inversion equations of the surface, we will illustrate our methods in action with three non-ruled quadrics: a sphere, a hyperboloid of two sheets, and an elliptical paraboloid.Example 1The sphereConsider the sphere with the homogeneous rational quadratic parametrizationP(s,t,u)=(2su,2tu,u2−s2−t2,u2+s2+t2).By inspection it is easy to see that the base points of this parametrization are located in complex projective space ats±ti=0,±u=0. Thus, for example, we can seek moving planes that follow the sphere of the form:(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(s−ti)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(−u)=0Solving forA,B,C,D,E,F,G,Hyields two solutions:(x+yi)(s−ti)+(w−z)(−u),(w+z)(s−ti)+(x−yi)(−u).Therefore the implicit equation of the sphere isdet⁡(x+yiw−zw+zx−yi)≡x2+y2+z2−w2=0.Notice that even though we have used complex parameters, we do indeed get an implicit equation with real coefficients.Splitting the two moving planes that follow the sphere into real and imaginary parts yields four real moving planes that follow the sphere:sx+ty+uz−uw=0−tx+sy=0−ux+sz+sw=0uy−tz−tw=0The four syzygies(s,t,u,−u),(−t,s,0,0),(−u,0,s,s),(0,u,−t,−t)are dependent, since they are all perpendicular to the parametrization, sodet⁡(stu−u−ts00−u0ss0u−t−t)=0.On the other hand, after we dehomogenize, the outer product of three of these four moving planes retrieves the dehomogenized parametrizationP˜(s,t)=P(s,t,1)of the sphere. Indeed letp˜=(s,t,1,−1),q˜=(−1,0,s,s),r˜=(0,1,−t,−t).Thenp˜,q˜,r˜are a μ-basis for the syzygy module ofP˜(s,t)and[p˜,q˜,r˜]=det⁡(ijklst1−1−10ss01−t−t)=P˜(s,t).Notice too thatq˜depends only on s andr˜depends only on t; compare to Example 3 in Chen et al. (2007). Finally solving the equationssx+ty+u(z−w)=0sy−tx=0fors,t,u, we get the inversion formulas:s=det⁡(w−zy0−x),t=det⁡(xw−zy0),u=det⁡(xyy−x).Example 2The sphere revisitedThe two moving planes we found in Example 1 are not unique. Consider again the sphere with the homogeneous rational quadratic parametrizationP(s,t,u)=(2su,2tu,u2−s2−t2,u2+s2+t2).Since the base points of this parametrization are located in complex projective space ats±ti=0,±u=0, we can choose any linear functions that intersect in one of these base points. For example, we can consider the moving planes(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(−si+t+u)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(−2si+2t).Now solving forA,B,C,D,E,F,G,Hyields the two solutions:(−xi+y+z−w)(−si+t+u)+(xi−z)(−2si+2t)(xi−y+z−w)(−si+t+u)+(y+w)(−2si+2t)Thus the implicit equation of the sphere isdet⁡(−xi+y+z−wxi−zxi−y+z−wy+w)≡x2+y2+z2−w2=0.Splitting the two moving planes that follow the sphere into real and imaginary parts yields four real moving planes that follow the sphere:sx+(t+u)y+(u−t)z−(t+u)w=0(t−u)x−sy+sz+sw=0sx+(t−u)y+(t+u)z+(t−u)w=0(t+u)x−sy−sz−sw=0.The four syzygies(s,t+u,u−t,−t−u),(t−u,−s,s,s),(s,t−u,t+u,t−u),(t+u,−s,−s,−s)are dependent, since they are all perpendicular to the parametrization, sodet⁡(st+uu−t−t−ut−u−sssst−ut+ut−ut+u−s−s−s)=0.On the other hand, after dehomogenization, these four syzygies generate the syzygy module of the dehomogenized parametrizationP˜(s,t)=P(s,t,1)of the sphere. Indeed, letp˜=(s,t+1,1−t,−t−1),q˜=12(s,t−1,t+1,t−1)−12(s,t+1,1−t,−t−1)=(0,−1,t,t),r˜=12(t−1,−s,s,s)−12(t+1,−s,−s,−s)=(−1,0,s,s).Thenp˜,q˜,r˜are a μ-basis for the syzygy module ofP˜(s,t)and[p˜,q˜,r˜]=det⁡(ijklst+11−t−t−10−1tt−10ss)=P˜(s,t).Notice again thatq˜depends only on t andr˜depends only on s. Finally solving the equationssx+(t+u)y+(u−t)z−(t+u)w=0(t−u)x−sy+sz+sw=0,fors,t,u, we get the inversion formulas:s=det⁡(w−y−zy−z−wxx),t=det⁡(xw−y−zz+w−yx),u=det⁡(xy−z−wz+w−yx).Example 3The hyperboloid of two sheetsThe hyperboloid of 2 sheets has essential the same parametrization as the sphere, but with the equations for the z and w coordinates reversed. Thus the hyperboloid of 2 sheets has the homogeneous rational quadratic parametrizationP(s,t,u)=(2su,2tu,u2+s2+t2,u2−s2−t2).Since these coordinate equations are the same as for the sphere, but with the equations for the z and w coordinates reversed, the base points of this parametrization are the same as the base points for the sphere and are located in complex projective space ats±ti=0,±u=0. Thus, we can seek moving planes that follow the hyperboloid of 2 sheets of the form:(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(s−ti)+(Ex+fy+Gz+Hw)(−u).Solving forA,B,C,D,E,F,G,Hyields two solutions:(x+yi)(s−ti)+(w−z)(u)−(w+z)(s−ti)+(x−yi)(u)Thus the implicit equation of the hyperboloid of 2 sheets isdet⁡(x+yiw−z−(w+z)x−yi)≡x2+y2−z2+w2=0.Notice again that even though we have used complex parameters, we do indeed get an implicit equation with real coefficients.Splitting the two moving planes that the follow the hyperboloid of 2 sheets into real and imaginary parts yields four real moving planes that follow the hyperboloid of 2 sheets:sx+ty−uz+uw=0−tx+sy=0ux−sz−sw=0−uy+tz+tw=0.The four syzygies(s,t,−u,u),(−t,s,0,0),(u,0,−s,−s),(0,−u,t,t)are dependent, since they are all perpendicular to the parametrization, sodet⁡(st−uu−ts00u0−s−s0−utt)=0.On the other hand, after we dehomogenize, the outer product of three of these four moving planes retrieves the dehomogenized parametrizationP˜(s,t)=P(s,t,1)of the hyperboloid of 2 sheets. Indeed letp˜=(s,t,−1,1),q˜=(−1,0,s,s),r˜=(0,−1,t,t).Thenp˜,q˜,r˜are a μ-basis for the syzygy module ofP˜(s,t)and[p˜,q˜,r˜]=det⁡(ijklst−11−10ss0−1tt)=P˜(s,t).Notice again thatq˜depends only on s andr˜depends only on t. Finally solving the equationssx+ty+u(w−z)=0sy−tx=0fors,t,u, we get the inversion formulas:s=det⁡(z−wy0−x),t=det⁡(xz−wy0),u=det⁡(xyy−x).Example 4The elliptical paraboloidConsider the elliptical paraboloid with the homogeneous rational quadratic parametrizationP(s,t,u)=(su,tu,s2+t2,u2).By inspection it is easy to see that the base points of this parametrization are once again located in complex projective space ats±ti=0,±u=0. Thus, once again, we can seek moving planes that follow the elliptical paraboloid of the form:(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(s−ti)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(−u).Solving forA,B,C,D,E,F,G,Hyields two solutions:(x+yi)(s−ti)+(z)(−u)(w)(s−ti)+(x−yi)(−u).Thus the implicit equation of the elliptical paraboloid isdet⁡(x+yizwx−yi)≡x2+y2−zw=0.Notice yet again that even though we have used complex parameters, we do indeed get an implicit equation with real coefficients.Splitting the two moving planes that the follow the elliptical paraboloid into real and imaginary parts yields four real moving planes that follow the elliptical paraboloid:sx+ty−uz=0−tx+sy=0−ux+sw=0uy−tw=0.The four syzygies(s,t,−u,0),(−t,s,0,0),(−u,0,0,s),(0,u,0,−t)are dependent, since they are all perpendicular to the parametrization, sodet⁡(st−u0−ts00−u00s0u0−t)=0.On the other hand, after dehomogenization, these four syzygies generate the syzygy module of the dehomogenized parametrizationP˜(s,t)=P(s,t,1)of the elliptical paraboloid. Indeed, letp˜=(s,t,−1,0)+(−t,s,0,0)=(s−t,s+t,−1,0),q˜=(−1,0,0,s),r˜=−(0,1,0,−t).Thenp˜,q˜,r˜are a μ-basis for the syzygy moduleP˜(s,t)and[p˜,q˜,r˜]=det⁡(ijkls−ts+t−10−100s0−10t)=P˜(s,t).Once again notice thatq˜depends only on s andr˜depends only on t. Finally solving the equationssx+ty−uz=0−tx+sy=0fors,t,u, we get the inversion formulas:s=det⁡(zy0−x),t=det⁡(xzy0),u=det⁡(xyy−x).Our method can also be used to find the implicit equation of any ruled quadric surface with a rational quadratic parametrization. But there are some differences when we apply the method to ruled quadrics. For non-ruled quadric surfaces, the base points are complex, but for ruled quadric surfaces the base points are real. Thus for non-ruled quadrics we generate two complex moving planes that follow the surface, which decompose into four real moving planes. But for ruled quadrics, we generate only two real moving planes that follow the surface, so for ruled quadrics the method is not as powerful: we can compute the implicit equation from these two moving planes, but the method fails to retrieve either the parametric equations or the inversion formulas because we no longer have a basis for the syzygy module of the parametrization. Below we illustrate this method for ruled quadric surfaces with the hyperbolic paraboloid and the right circular cone.Example 5The hyperbolic paraboloidConsider the hyperbolic paraboloid with the homogeneous rational quadratic parametrizationP(s,t,u)=(su,tu,s2−t2,u2).By inspection it is easy to see that the base points of this parametrization are located ats=±t,u=0. Thus, we can seek moving planes that follow the hyperbolic paraboloid of the form:(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(s−t)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(u).Solving forA,B,C,D,E,F,G,Hagain yields two solutions:(x+y)(s−t)+(z)(−u)(w)(s−t)+(x−y)(−u)Thus the implicit equation of the hyperbolic paraboloid isdet⁡(x+yzwx−y)≡x2−y2−zw=0.Notice that since the moving planes are real, we have only two moving planes, not four, that follow the hyperbolic paraboloid, and we cannot retrieve the parametric equations from these two moving planes. Moreover, we do not get inversions formulas. Indeed in this case if we try to solve the equations(x+y)(s−t)+(z)(−u)=0(w)(s−t)+(x−y)(−u)=0fors,t,u, we get the formulas:s=det⁡(z−(x+y)x−y−w),t=det⁡(x+yzwx−y),u=det⁡(x+y−(x+y)w−w),which all evaluate to zero on the surface of the hyperbolic paraboloid. However, for the hyperbolic paraboloid we can easily find a third syzygy:ys−xt=0.Placing the coefficients with respect tos,t,−uof our three syzygies in a matrix and computing the determinant yieldsdet⁡(x+y−(x+y)zw−wx−yy−x0)≡(x−y)(x2−y2−zw)=0,which is the implicit equation multiplied by an extraneous factor. Now after dehomogenization, the outer product of these three syzygies retrieves the dehomogenized parametrizationP˜(s,t)=P(s,t,1)of the hyperbolic paraboloid, but again with an extraneous factor. Indeed, letp˜=(s−t,s−t,−1,0),q˜=(−1,1,0,s−t),r˜=(−t,s,0,0).Then[p˜,q˜,r˜]=det⁡(ijkls−ts−t−10−110s−t−ts00)=(t−s)P˜(s,t).Finally, now we can also get inversion formulas from the two syzygies:ws−wt+(x−y)(−u)=0ys−xt=0.Solving these two equation fors,t,uyields:s=det⁡(x−y−w0−x),t=det⁡(wx−yy0),u=det⁡(w−wy−x).Example 6The right circular coneConsider the right circular cone with the homogeneous rational quadratic parametrizationP(s,t,u)=(2st,s2−t2,s2+t2,w(s,t,u)),wherew(s,t,u)is any homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 ins,t,u. By inspection it is easy to see that this parametrization has a base point ats=t=0, provided thatw(s,t,u)has nou2term. Moreover if there is nou2term, then this parametrization has a double base point ats=t=0. (In fact, this method works even ifw(s,t,u)does have au2term, indeed even ifw(s,t,u)=u2, because the implicit equation of the cone is a homogeneous polynomial inx,y,z, so neither w nor u enter into this computation.) Thus, we shall seek moving planes that follow the right circular cone of the form:(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(s)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(−t).Solving forA,B,C,D,E,F,G,Hyields two solutions:(x)(s)+(y+z)(−t)(z−y)(s)+(x)(−t).Thus the implicit equation of the right circular cone isdet⁡(xz+yz−yx)≡x2+y2−z2=0.Notice that in this case the two moving planes are simply(s,−t,−t)and(−t,−s,s). Taking their cross product, we find that(−t,−s,s)×(s,−t,−t)=(2st,s2−t2,s2+t2),which are the three significant components of the parametrization. This cross product computation works in this special case because the fourth componentw(s,t)does not enter into the implicit equation. Nevertheless even in this case if we try to solve the equations(x)(s)+(y+z)(−t)=0(z−y)(s)+(x)(−t)=0fors,t,u, we get the formulas:s=det⁡(0−(y+z)0−x),t=det⁡(x0z−y0),u=det⁡(x−(y+z)z−y−x),which all evaluate to zero on the surface of the cone.

The use of complex parameters and complex moving planes that follow a rational surface works nicely for finding complex analogues of μ-bases for non-ruled quadric surfaces. But this method is not a panacea. We have seen that the same method, without complex parameters, can be used to find the implicit equation of a ruled quadric surface with a rational quadratic parametrization, but in general for ruled quadric surfaces this method fails to retrieve either the parametric equations or the inversion formulas.Moreover, different parametric representations for the same algebraic surface may have different syzygy modules. Thus the method can fail even for higher degree parametrizations of non-ruled quadric surfaces. For example, there is a biquadratic parametrization of the sphere given byx(s,t)=(1−s2)(1−t2),y(s,t)=2s(1−t2),z(s,t)=2t(1+s2),w(s,t)=(1+s2)(1+t2).Since the implicit degree of the sphere is two, this parametrization has six base points, four of which are located att=±1,s=±i. Yet there are no moving planes of the form(Ax+By+Cz+Dw)(s±i)+(Ex+Fy+Gz+Hw)(t±1)that follow this parametrization because we have only 8 free parameters, but there are15−4=11constraints. Thus the method does not work, in general, for surfaces of bidegree(2,2), even when there are lots of base points.
