@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we propose a new random volatility model, where the volatility has a deterministic term structure modified by a scalar random variable. Closed-form approximation is derived for European option price using higher order Greeks with respect to volatility. We show that the calibration of our model is often more than two orders of magnitude faster than the calibration of commonly used stochastic volatility models, such as the Heston model or Bates model. On 15 different index option data sets, we show that our model achieves accuracy comparable with the aforementioned models, at a much lower computational cost for calibration. Further, our model yields prices for certain exotic options in the same range as these two models. Lastly, the model yields delta and gamma values for options in the same range as the other commonly used models, over most of the data sets considered. Our model has a significant potential for use in high frequency derivative trading.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The central assumption of the celebrated Black–Scholes formula for European option pricing is that the volatility of the underlying asset is constant (Black and Scholes, 1973). This is known to be untrue in practice. The observed prices of liquid options on the same underlying, for a given set of maturities and strikes, imply different volatilities under Black–Scholes formulation. Modelling the future evolution of the volatility of the underlying asset, which is consistent with the observed option prices, is obviously essential to price illiquid securities on the same underlying asset. The topic of suitable volatility models which provide a consistent match with the observed prices has resulted in extensive literature over the past few decades.There are two broad classes of volatility models: local volatility models and stochastic volatility models. Note that this is a rather imprecise taxonomy, but it will be sufficient for our purpose. The former class of models does not have an additional source of uncertainty (apart from the sources of uncertainty in the underlying) incorporated in the volatility model and the volatility is assumed to be a deterministic function of the current underlying price and time. Examples of this type of models include the models proposed by Dupire (1994), Derman and Kani (1994) and (Alexander, 2004). In contrast, stochastic volatility models include an extra source (or sources) of randomness and provide more flexibility in modelling the dynamics of volatility surface. Significant models in this class, with an emphasis on option pricing, include those proposed by Hull and White (1987), Merton (1976), Heston (1993), Bates (1996), Kou (2002), Duffie, Pan, and Singleton (2000) and Carr, Geman, Madan, and Yor (2003). Bakshi, Cao, and Chen (1997) have compared a variety of stochastic volatility models in terms of their pricing and hedging performance. Heston as well as Bates model yields semi-closed form solutions in terms of Fourier transform of European option price and are hence amenable to relatively easy calibration to market data. Gatheral (2006) and Javaheri (2011) provide comprehensive reviews of development of volatility models.In this work, we propose a new method for modelling the volatility as implied by the option prices. In our model, volatility is represented as a deterministic function of time, with its level being a random variable on positive support. The proposed volatility model offers the following benefits:•It provides a very simple approximate pricing function for calibrating the model from option price data. In the experiments performed, we demonstrate that the proposed model requires only around 1 percent of the computational time as the Heston model or the Bates model for calibration, on the same hardware.In 15 different data sets tested for three different indices and using two different methods of measuring the pricing error, the proposed model is shown to be extremely competitive in terms of accuracy with the popular existing stochastic volatility models.When calibrated from the same data set, the proposed model also yields prices for path-dependent payoffs which are in the same range as the Heston model and Bates model. This is important since the prices of illiquid payoffs are non-unique under stochastic volatility and any new model which gives significantly different prices from the established models is unlikely to be accepted by the industrial community.When calibrated from the same data set and using the same numerical method, the proposed model yields option price sensitivity parameters which are very close to those found for one of the two benchmark models, for most data sets. Option sensitivities (or Greeks) are important for risk monitoring and hedging purposes and our experiments show that hedging using our model is unlikely to provide significantly different results than hedging using the Heston model.Note that, apart from the Bates model and the Heston model, several other analytically tractable options exist for modelling volatility (as mentioned earlier). Our purpose is simply to establish that our new model yields accuracy comparable to some of the popular existing models, while being significantly easier to calibrate, and easier to simulate from, than those models. Hence we have restricted our benchmark comparison to the two aforementioned models.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we will briefly outline the two main stochastic volatility models to which our model will later be compared. In Section 3, we will present our new model. Section 4 on numerical experiments is split into three subsections: Section 4.1 outlines the data used, Section 4.2 explains the methodology employed in comparing the performance of different models and lastly Section 4.3 provides the results and a discussion. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the contributions of the paper and outlines the directions of future research.We will first outline the formulae for pricing European options using Heston and Bates (SVJ) models, since we will later use these two models as benchmarks. All the subsequent discussion is in a (non-unique) equivalent martingale measure and we will omit explicit mention of measure for simplicity. For the Heston model, the asset price dynamics is assumed to be governed by:(1)dSt=rStdt+vtStdWt1,(2)dvt=−θ(v¯−vt)dt+σvvtdWt2,where r is the risk-free rate,Wt1andWt1are standard Wiener processes with a given correlation〈Wt1,Wt2〉=ρandρ,σv,θ,v0,v¯are known constants. The price of European call option with strike price K is given by:(3)CEUR=StP1−Ke−r(T−t)P2,where Stis the spot price at time t, T is the expiration time and Pj, j = 1, 2 are called the pseudo-probabilities:(4)Pj=12+1π∫0∞Re[eixlog(StK)eϕj(vt,τ,x)ix]dx.Here, τ = T − t andϕj(vt,τ,x)=exp{Cj(τ,x)v¯+Dj(τ,x)vt}is the characteristic function, withCj(τ,x)=rxiτ+θσv2[(bj−ρσvxi+dj)τ−2log1−djedjτ1−gj],Dj(τ,x)=bj−ρσvxi+djσv2[1−edjτ1−gjedjτ],gj=bj−ρσvxi+djbj−ρσvxi−dj,dj=(ρσvxi)2−σv2(2ujxi−x2),u1=12,u2=−12,andbj=κ+θ−(1j=1)ρσv.Bates (1996) proposed adding a compound Poisson process in the underlying for the above model, which leads to a modification of (1):(5)dStSt=rdt+vtdWt1+(eα+βϵ−1)dJt,where Jtis Poisson process with a known jump intensity λp, α, β are known constants and ε ∼ N(0, 1). The process Jtis uncorrelated withWti,(i=1,2). The volatility dynamics is described by Eq. (2). This model is also commonly referred to as SVJ (stochastic volatility with jumps) model. The solution for price of a European call option is given by modifying the characteristic function in the Heston model above:ϕj(vt,τ,x)=exp{Cj(τ,x)v¯+Dj(τ,x)vt+E(x)τ},whereE(x)=−λpix(eα+β2/2−1)+λp(eixα−x2β2/2−1).While both these models have proved popular and are known to provide good fits to option prices, they have a few shortcomings. Some of these are discussed in  Mikhailov and Nögel (2004). In particular, it was shown that Heston model usually fails to fit to a short term market skew while the SVJ model usually fails to fit an inverse yield curve. In addition, the option price is given through a fairly involved numerical integral with several parameters, which presents significant difficulties in calibration.We will now introduce the basic idea of our model. Recall that, by definition, European call option is a right to buy an asset at maturity time T for a strike price K. For a non-dividend paying stock, its price at time t is given by discounted expectation of terminal pay-off:Ct=e−r(T−t)E[(ST−K,0)+].Under Black–Scholes framework with constant volatility, this discounted expected value is given byCBS=StN(d1)−e−rτKN(d2),d1=(στ)−1[log(St/K)+(r+σ2/2)τ],d2=d1−(στ),where r is the constant risk-free rate, σ is the volatility, N(x) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function and τ = T − t is the time to maturity. The derivation of Black–Scholes price also assumes that short-selling as well as trading in continuous time is possible. One of the simplest frameworks to introduce a stochastic component in the volatility is to consider a Hull–White type model of the asset price process (Hull and White, 1987):(6)dSt=rStdt+vtStdWt1,(7)dvt=f1(t,vt)dt+f2(t,vt)dWt2,whereWt1andWt2are uncorrelated Wiener processes and f1, f2 are smooth functions bounded by linear growth such that vtremains non-negative almost surely.  Hull and White (1987) show that the price of European vanilla call option at time 0, for a time to maturity τ can be derived as expectation of Black–Scholes price with respect to the variance rate:(8)CEUR=E[CBS(1τ∫0τvtdt)]where CBS(x) denotes Black–Scholes price evaluated at variance x. The above formula is independent of the exact process followed by vt(under normal assumptions about t − continuity and uniqueness). Denoting the variance rate1τ∫0τvtdtbyV¯τand assuming that the moments in question exist, we can expand the right hand side of (8) aroundE(V¯τ)in Taylor series as(9)CEUR≈CBS(E(Vτ¯))+∑i=2M∂iCBS∂Vτ¯iE(Vτ¯−E(Vτ¯))ii!,where the partial derivatives are evaluated atE(Vτ¯). Our aim is to construct a process for vtfor which the right hand side of the above equation is easy to evaluate (for a reasonably large M), while remaining sufficiently flexible to fit the observed option prices. Note that truncating after the first term will mean that prices of options with all strikes for a fixed time to maturity should be the same, which is obviously nonsense. This illustrates the need for non-zero higher moments forV¯τ(and hence the need for randomness in volatility) in an intuitively simple fashion.Without loss of generality, let t = 0 be the current time and let t0 > 0 be an arbitrary time which is less than the shortest time to maturity of any derivative product which we want to price using our model. We will allow the diffusion term in the volatility process of (7) to be non-zero only within [0, t0). This will allow us to use a single random variable, rather than an evolving random process, to model the randomness in volatility when pricing securities at time t = 0, whose payoffs are beyond t0. Note that option pricing models are always used for pricing securities with finite, rather than infinitesimal, time to maturity. Further, t0 itself does not appear in the pricing formulae (only an integrated variance term does, as we shall see) and can be assumed to be arbitrarily small. Next, we assume that vtin (7) is governed by the following, specific stochastic process:(10)dvt=(μtdt+γtdWt2)vt,where μtis a positive deterministic and integrable function, γtis a positive deterministic function which is piecewise continuous, with γt= 0, t > t0 andWt2is a standard Wiener process uncorrelated withWt1. Using Itô’s lemma, it is straightforward to show thatvt=exp(∫0tμsds)ζt,where ζtis a log-normal process with unit mean and a constant variance for t > t0. In particular,Var(ζt)=(exp{∫0t0γs2ds}−1),t>t0.We will henceforth assume that t > t0 holds. Letk=Var(ζt). Then the third and the forth centered moments of ζt, m3 and m4 respectively, can be expressed as:(11)m3=k4(3+k2),(12)m4=k4{(1+k2)4+2(1+k2)3+3(1+k2)2−3}.We will parameterize the standard deviation k of the lognormal random variable ζtdirectly, with no reference to γtor t0. Finally, we parameterizeexp(∫0tμsds)asexp(∫0tμsds)=σ^02e−λt+σ^12λte−λt+σ^22,whereσ^0,σ^1,σ^2,λare scalar parameters. This gives our variance model parameterization as(13)vt=ζt(σ^02e−λt+σ^12λte−λt+σ^22),ζt∼LN(1,k2),t>t0.Along with (6), (13) completely specifies our pricing model within the chosen pricing measure, which is implicitly specified by the data used for calibration. We will call our model as high order Moments-based Stochastic Volatility (MSV) model, since it is based on the use of higher order moments of the aforementioned random variable. With this definition of vt, we have(14)V¯τ:=1τ∫0τvtdt=ζt(σ^02+σ^12λτ+σ^12+σ^22−σ^121−e−λτ)(1−e−λτ)︸Qτ,where Qτis a deterministic function. As we can see in Eq. (14), Qτis actually the equation for Nelson and Siegel (1987) spot rate curve used in interest rate modelling. While our application is unrelated to modelling interest rates, we chose this parametrization for its known ability to represent a variety of relevant shapes of term structure (both concave and convex), with a suitable choice of parameters. Since, European option price for any τ > 0 is a smooth function with respect toV¯τ,one can apply Taylor series expansion to the Black–Scholes option price CBS around a pointE(V¯τ)=Qτ:(15)CEUR(V¯τ)≈CBS+∂2CBS∂V¯τ2E(V¯τ−Qτ)22+∂3CBS∂V¯τ3E(V¯τ−Qτ)36+∂4CBS∂V¯τ4E(V¯τ−Qτ)424,where CBS and its partial derivatives are evaluated atV¯τ=Qτ. These partial derivatives for a European call option can be evaluated as:(16)ν:=∂CBS∂V¯τ=Ke−rτϕ(−d2)τ,∂2CBS∂V¯τ2=νd1d2Qτ,∂3CBS∂V¯τ3=−νQτ2[d1d2(1−d1d2)+d12+d22],∂4CBS∂V¯τ4=ν12d1d2+3τQτ2(1−d1d2)−d12d22(9−d1d2)Qτ3,withd1=log(S0/K)+(r+Qτ2/2)τQττ,d2=d1−Qττandϕ(x)=(2π)−1∫0xe−0.5u2du. Similar expressions can easily be derived for an approximation to the price of a European put option.We can now re-write the first four moments ofV¯as the following:(17)E(V¯τ)=Qτ,E(V¯τ−Qτ)2=k2Qτ2,E(V¯τ−Qτ)3=k4(3+k2)Qτ3,E(V¯τ−Qτ)4=k4{(1+k2)4+2(1+k2)3+3(1+k2)2−3}Qτ4.Eqs. (13)–(15) together with Eqs. (16)–(17) define our approximate option pricing model. Along with the parametersσ^0,σ^1,σ^2,λwhich appear in Qτ, the parameter k which characterises the distribution of ζtcompletes the set of parameters for our volatility model specification.A few remarks on this model are in order.•In empirical experiments which follow in the next section, we found that a third or a fifth order Taylor series approximation, in place of the fourth order approximation used here, makes very little difference. However, using k = 0 leads to very poor fits on calibration, again indicating that randomness is necessary to model the volatility dynamics adequately.There is zero correlation between the sources of randomness in the underlying and the volatility, and there is no risk premium attached to the randomness in volatility. However, our choice of simpler volatility model seems to provide a fit which is quite competitive in terms of accuracy when compared to models with non-zero correlation, at a small fraction of calibration cost, over a large number of data sets. Our admittedly limited evidence indicates that choosing a sufficiently flexible parameterized function of time can compensate at least partially for not modelling the correlation between the volatility and the price of the underlying.For calibration and validation of our model, we used option price data {Strike price, Maturity, Implied Volatility, Bid, Ask and underlying values on the date of reading} obtained from Bloomberg Option Monitor (OMON). Implied risk free rates were calculated using implied volatilities and option prices by simple nonlinear least squares, for each maturity. We chose European call options with a minimum of 30 days to maturity and up to 3 years to maturity, with strike prices to be both in-the-money and out-of-the money values. The total data consisted of closing option prices on 3 different stock indices {S&P 500, FTSE 100 and DAX} on five different, arbitrarily chosen days {01 November 2012, 26 November 2012, 25 July 2013, 26 July 2013, 29 July 2013}, with 100 options for each index and day. This gave a total of 15 data sets (one for each index and each day), from two different years, with 100 prices in each data set.11Note that the authors have carried out numerical experiments over more data sets and the results presented here are deemed to be representative.
