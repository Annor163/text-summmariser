@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We describe a method for a reconstructing piecewise helix curve from its 2D sketch. The system takes as input a hand-drawn polygonal curve and generates a piecewise helix curve such that its orthogonal projection matches the input curve. The first step is an algorithm to generate a set of helices such that their orthogonal projection approximates the input curve. This step is followed by a global optimization to minimize the tangent discontinuity of the junctions of the helices while keeping the fitting error small.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Helices are curves whose curvature and torsion are constant. These curves are very common in nature and among man-made objects: hair curls, coiled phone cords, spring coils, tendrils of climbing plants, etc. In this paper, we present a method to fit a curve which is the orthogonal projection of a piecewise helix curve to a 2D polygonal curve provided by the user. The main difficulty resides in the fact that the helix and the curve that is the projection of the helix have different curvature.
