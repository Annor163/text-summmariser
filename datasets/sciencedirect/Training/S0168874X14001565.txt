@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An Element-free Galerkin scaled boundary method (EFG-SBM) based partitioning algorithm is proposed for the 2D steady-state heat transfer analysis of cyclically symmetrical structures. The eigenvalue matrices of EFG-SBM for the rotationally periodic system are proved to be block-circulant under a symmetry-adapted reference coordinate system. Furthermore, both the eigenvalue and system equations can be partitioned into a number of smaller independent problems which are solved by a partitioning algorithm. Numerical examples are given to verify the proposed algorithm in term of computing accuracy and efficiency.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As a semi-analytical method [1–4], the scaled boundary method (SBM) is more efficient than finite element method (FEM) for problems involving unbounded domain or/and local singularity [5–7], and has been combined with FEM [3–6], meshless local petrov-galerkin method (MLPGM) [7], or element-free galerkin method (EFGM) [8,9] to tackle with elastostatics or heat transfer problems. However, higher computing expense, mainly caused by an eigenproblem, is one of the barriers for the further application of SBM.The present paper aims at reducing computing cost of EFG-SBM in the heat transfer analysis for a special kind of structure, i.e. the structure with cyclic symmetry. By exploiting the cyclic symmetry of this kind of structure, it is proved that the matrices of eigenvalue and system equations of EFG-SBM of the cyclically symmetrical structures are block-circulant so long as a kind of symmetry-adapted reference coordinate system is adopted. Furthermore, both the eigenvalue and system equations are partitioned into a number of smaller independent problems which are solved by a partitioning algorithm. Actually there was some previous work concerned with exploitation of the cyclic symmetry in elastostatics [10–16,18] or heat transfer analysis [17], but it seems no report relevant to EFG-SBM.This paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, EFG-SBM for steady-state heat transfer is derived in Section 2 and rotationally periodic symmetrical structures are introduced in Section 3. Then, Section 4 presents a partitioning algorithm for EFG-SBM of the special structure and the proof of the block-circulant property of the global EFG-SBM coefficient matrices is given in Appendix A (i.e. Section 7). Two numerical examples are presented in Section 5 to assess the computational convenience and efficiency of the proposed method. Discussion and conclusions from this study are given in Section 6.The governing equation of heat conduction problems in the steady state can be written in a tensor form [21](1)k∇2T+Q=0where k denotes thermal conductive parameter, T represents temperature, Q is a source related term.The boundary conditions are specified by [21](2)T=T¯onΓ1(3)−k(∂T∂n)=qnonΓ2(4)−k(∂T∂n)=h(T−Ta)onΓ3whereΓ=Γ1+Γ2+Γ3denotes the boundaries of the problem.T¯and qnare the prescribed temperature and heat flux, on the corresponding boundaries, respectively. h and Tarefer to the convection heat transfer coefficient and environmental temperature.A weak form of Eqs. (1)–(4) can be written as [21](5)∫VδT(k∇2T+Q)dV−∫Γ2δT(k∂T∂n+qn)dΓ−∫Γ3δT[k∂T∂n+h(T−Ta)]dΓ=0whereδTstands for a weighting function.The application of integral by parts leads to(6)−∫VδTQdV+∫Vk(∂δT∂x∂T∂x+∂δT∂y∂T∂y)dV+∫Γ2δTqndΓ+∫Γ3δTh(T−Ta)dΓ=0The scaled boundary method introduces such a ξ-s coordinate system by scaling a defining curve relative to a scaling centre (x0, y0) selected within the domain, as shown inFig. 1. The coordinate ξ runs from the scaling centre towards the curve, and has values of zero at the scaling centre and unity at the curve. The coordinate s specifies a distance around the boundary from an origin on the boundary [6,7].For the 2-D problem, the scaled and Cartesian coordinate systems are related by [6,7](7a)x=x0+ξxs(s)(7b)y=y0+ξys(s)In the SBM, an approximate solution is sought in the form(8)T(ξ,s)=N(s)T(ξ)whereN(s)is a matrix of shape functions andT(ξ)refers to a nodal vector of temperature along the curve with constant ξ.The approximate derivatives of temperature are(9){∂T(ξ,s)∂x∂T(ξ,s)∂y}=B1(s)T(ξ),ξ+1ξB2(s)T(ξ)where(10)B1(s)=b1(s)N(s)=1|J|{ys(s),s−xs(s),s}⋅N(s)(11)B2(s)=b2(s)N(s),s=1|J|{−ys(s)xs(s)}⋅N(s),s(12)|J|=xs(s)ys(s),s−ys(s)xs(s),swhereN(s),srefers to the derivative ofN(s)with respect to s.Assume(13)δT(ξ,s)=N(s)δT(ξ)whereδT(ξ)refers to a set of n functions analytical in ξ.Thus(14){∂δT(ξ,s)∂x∂δT(ξ,s)∂y}=B1(s)δT(ξ),ξ+1ξB2(s)δT(ξ)In the absence of internal heat generation or source term, substituting Eqs.

(24) and (27) can be further expressed as [6,7](28)[Z11Z12Z21Z22]{ϕq}=λ{ϕq}where(29a)Z11=E0−1[E1+E3]T(29b)Z12=−E0−1(29c)Z21=[E1+E3]E0−1[E1+E3]T−E2(29d)Z22=−[E1+E3]E0−1Zij(i,j=1,2)are the eigenvalue matrices which connect the modal temperatures with the weighted modal nodal thermal load and the eigenvectors contain both them.Left-multiplying both sides of Eq.

(44) means thatΓican be obtained fromΓ1, which is called ‘basic region’ and can be arbitrarily chosen from those identical parts. For any node or integration point in the basic region, there are certainly other N−1 different nodes or integration points, which are located symmetrically on the other N−1 symmetry regions. All these N nodes constitute a set of symmetric nodes, which is called symmetric node orbit, and is designated as OA(45)OA={A1,A2,…,AN}In Fig. 2, it is readily seen that the six interface nodes Bi(i=1,…,N) constitute orbit OB. Only those nodes that are located on the internal part and the ‘right’ interface ofΓ1are regarded as belonging to the basic region. Only B1 is regarded as belonging toΓ1and B2 will then be regarded as belonging toΓ2.Consider a cyclically symmetric structure with order N and there are m nodes at each symmetry region.

(28), one only needs to solve a series of independent small sub-eigenvalue-problems described by Eq. (60).When all boundary conditions are rotationally symmetric,(68)P1=P2=⋯=PN(69)P̲2=P̲3=⋯=P̲N=0,P̲1=NP¯1One only needs to solve the first sub problem in Eq.

(31) can be solved by solving a series of smaller independent problems described by Eq. (66). When prescribed temperature distribution is not rotationally symmetric, Eq.

(70).Consequently the major computing expense of EFG-SBM can be significantly reduced by the exploration of cyclic symmetry.Two numerical examples are given to verify the proposed algorithm.Materials parameters arek=1W/(m⋅k)andQ=0W/m3.All the computations are carried out on a PC with Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2100 CPU @3.10GHzNumerical Example 1 considers a regular 16-edge polygonal plate as shown inFig. 3 whereR=1m. At corner point of each side,T¯=5°C, the boundary conditions of two opposite sides of plate follow−k(∂T/∂n)=qnwhereqn=5W/m2. 100 nodes are uniformly arranged at each sub-cyclic symmetry region. All geometric, physical properties and essential boundary conditions are cyclic symmetry with N=16.A comparison of computing expense is given inTables 1–3 exhibit comparisons of computing accuracy with ANSYS (18179 nodes and 5922 8-node-quadrangle finite elements). The relative error of solutions given by the proposed algorithm and ANSYS is less than 0.80%.Fig. 4 shows the contour plots of temperature in the whole domain. The results show that the contours from EFG-SBM are continuous and smooth, and the distribution is virtually identical with ANSYS solution in the whole domain.Numerical Example 2 considers a regular octagonal gear as shown inFig. 5 whereR1=1mandR2=2m. At point 2,T¯=5°C, the boundary conditions of the right side edges of four corners follow−k(∂T/∂n)=qnwhereqn=1W/m2, other left side edges followqn=−1W/m2. 30 nodes are uniformly arranged at every edge. Both geometry and physical properties are cyclic symmetry with N=8, but essential boundary condition is not cyclic symmetry.Table 4 gives a comparison of computing time.Tables 5 and 6 exhibit a comparison of computing accuracy with ANSYS (6960 nodes and 2181 8-node-quadrangle finite elements). The line 1 is from point A (−0.46, 0.19) to B (−1, 0). The relative error of solutions given by the proposed algorithm and ANSYS is less than 0.015%.The comparison of thermal gradient vector sum at corner points between EFG-SBM and ANSYS is showed inFig. 6. The thermal gradient vector sum at corner points from No. 1 to 9 corresponding to the heat flux boundaries is higher than other corner points. The thermal gradient vector sum at sharp corner points is higher than those at concave corner points. The distribution curve of thermal gradient vector sums of EFG-SBM is consistent with ANSYS.1.The major computing cost of EFG-SBM consists of two parts, i.e. i) the expense on generating K, ii) the expense on solving eigenvalue problem. By utilizing the cyclic symmetry and partitioning algorithm, the major computing cost can be significantly reduced as shown in Tables 1 and 4.In comparison with ANSYS, a sufficient computing accuracy can be provided by the proposed algorithm, as shown in Tables 2, 3, 5, 6 and Fig. 6.
