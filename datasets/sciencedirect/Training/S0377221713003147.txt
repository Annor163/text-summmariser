@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Because of cost and time limit factors, the number of samples is usually small in the early stages of manufacturing systems, and the scarcity of actual data will cause problems in decision-making. In order to solve this problem, this paper constructs a counter-intuitive hypothesis testing method by choosing the maximal p-value based on a two-parameter Weibull distribution to enhance the estimate of a nonlinear and asymmetrical shape of product lifetime distribution. Further, we systematically generate virtual data to extend the small data set to improve learning robustness of product lifetime performance. This study provides simulated data sets and two practical examples to demonstrate that the proposed method is a more appropriate technique to increase estimation accuracy of product lifetime for normal or non-normal data with small sample sizes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In practical manufacturing, the Process Capability Index (PCI), as a numerical measure on product lifetime, has been widely applied to measure the product lifetime performance (e.g., see Chen and Chen (2004), Chang and Wu (2008), Wu and Pearn (2008), Pearn et al. (2009), Wu et al. (2009)). Before using these indexes, it is necessary to determine an appropriate product lifetime distribution, because the estimation accuracy of the lifetime distribution plays a crucial role to influence the accuracy of applying PCI. Many studies have provided approaches for this, such as the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) (e.g., see Tan (2009), Park (2010)), the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (e.g., see Gupta et al. (2008), Jiang et al. (2008)), and Bayesian approach (e.g., see Wu (2008)). However, these approaches are generally used to fit a dependable product lifetime distribution under a necessary condition of sufficient samples. Unfortunately, with today’s extremely competitive marketplace of rapidly replaced products, decision-makers often only possess very few experimental data due to cost and time limitations. Under the circumstance, the sample size is too small to find a reliable lifetime distribution.In practice, while the sampling distribution of product lifetime for small samples is not distinct, the nonparametric bootstrapping method (BM) (Mooney et al., 1993) has been used as an effective technique to estimate the distribution, such as in the PCI’s application, Hsu et al. (2009) utilized the BM to calculate the estimator of the PCICPUTfor multiple process characteristics. However, when new samples are drawn from the small data set, the resampling BM may be too conservative to behave realistically for very small data sets. Facing this problem, many researchers tried to analyze the collected data and explore the potential information by producing virtual samples. For example, Cho et al. (1997) suggested generating virtual samples to improve learning accuracy with small data sets and selecting a close-by observation of a real sample to be a virtual sample via the underlying population network. Yonezawa et al. (1999) proposed the estimation method for a Normal distribution and directionally generated samples in the estimated region. However, since the generated sample may be not fitted by a Normal distribution in a small data set, some researchers produced other virtual samples to deal with non-normal data. Li et al. (2003) proposed an approach which used Functional Virtual Population (FVP) to generate more samples for training. The idea is to expand, directed by the selected criterion, the domain of each attribute or variable in a small data set to create a new virtual sample set. Li and Lin (2006) suggested a nonparametric statistics method called intervalized kernel methods of density estimation to improve small sample set learning to fit the correct data distribution. Li et al. (2006, 2007) proposed the Mega-Trend-Diffusion (MTD) technique to form a triangular membership function which was considered as a small sample distribution. Using this, they calculated the domain range of a small data set and produced virtual samples to improve the accuracy of small data set learning for early Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) scheduling knowledge. Furthermore, Lin and Li (2010) proposed the generalized trend diffusion modeling algorithm that was an improved version of the MTD method, and was applied for time series data sets. In the literatures of the MTD, the learning model is a linear function to generate virtual samples. However, virtual sample generation is often more appropriate to use a nonlinear model to learn various data sets.With a small data set, a two-parameter Weibull distribution is popularly a used nonlinear distribution in reliability and lifetime testing. For instance, Abernethy (2004) proposed utilizing the flexible shape parameters of this distribution to manage manufacturing processes with limited data. His research was supported by Nelson (1982) who considered that the Weibull distribution could manage product lifetime distribution for normal or non-normal data. In order to find the parameters of the Weibull distribution, a hypothesis testing technique has been commonly used to consider rejecting the null hypothesis with a smaller and better p-value. However, it is hard to choose the best-fitting shape parameter due to the found distinct shape parameters may possess small and close p-values. Therefore, in this paper we present a new approach, based on the Weibull distribution, which develops a counter-intuitive hypothesis testing procedure to find a reliable shape parameter of the distribution. In the proposed testing procedure, we apply the Gini statistic, a kind of two-tailed distributions, as a testing statistic to accept the null hypothesis using the maximal p-value. Then, virtual samples can be generated from the found Weibull distribution to extend the lifetime data set to improve estimation accuracy for assessing product lifetime performance. Finally, several simulation data sets and two practical examples are used in the product lifetime performance testing procedure to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method (PM) by comparing it with the Least-Squares Estimation (LSE) approach.This research is organized as follows: Section 2 offers the related works including reviews for Small-Data-Set problems and a widely-used LSE approach of fitting product distribution with a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Furthermore, product lifetime performance testing procedures are introduced based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution. Section 3 describes our proposed method how to generate virtual samples. Section 4 provides simulation data and two practical examples to illustrate the estimation accuracy of product lifetime performance by using methods (i.e., LSE and PM). Finally, we present the conclusions of this research in Section 5.Our research mainly aimed at finding some of solutions of small-data-set problems, where the LSE method of parameter estimation of two-parameter Weibull distribution is employed in the developing process. Since it is a general sense that a great number of data ordinarily provide more information of a manufacturing system to researchers to obtain a more reliable product lifetime distribution. Therefore, researchers have tried to investigate effective ways to improve estimation accuracy of lifetime distribution from samples of small sizes by expanding the data sets.In the statistical field, a small data set is difficult to find a stable sample distribution (Judge et al., 1988). Even in the application of the central limit theorem, it still requires a large data size to fit a normal sample distribution. Facing this specific condition, research has been implemented such as, Zhang et al. (2007) constructed two kinds of Least-Squares Estimation (LSE) methods with regard to different limitations for small sample analysis. Abernethy (2004) proposed a method to utilize the flexible shape parameters of the Weibull distribution to control manufacturing processes for small sample sets. Further, some studies are recommended about generating the virtual data set to improve small data sets learning with the concept illustration of Fig. 1. For instance, Li and Lin (2006) proposed a nonparametric statistics method called intervalized kernel method of density estimation to improve small sample set learning to find the correct population distribution. Their paper gave a more accurate and stable method to estimate a data distribution for rare samples, excepting that the parametric statistics method is only applicable to numerical data with interval or ratio scales (interval scale means that the data show the properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is expresses in terms of a fixed unit of measure, while the ratio scale means that the data have all the properties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful (Siegel, 1957). As portrayed in Fig. 2, the MTD method Li et al. (2006) constructs a triangular form function to calculate the range of virtual data, which is the interval from a to b described mathematically as:(1)a=min-1NU×uset1-1NU,1<NU<∞(2)b=max-1NL×uset1-1NL,1<NL<∞,where the min and max are the minimum and maximum values of the realistic data set. The NUand NLrepresent the number of data less and larger than uset=(min+max)/2, respectively. After estimating the values of a and b, the virtual samples uniformly distributed are generated in the interval [a,b], and added to the realistic dataset for learning accuracy.Weibull distribution is a commonly used distribution to estimate the fitted small data set distribution (Abernethy, 2004). Given a data set X which is denoted by a two-parameter Weibull distribution (Weibull, 1951), and the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the Weibull distribution is expressed as:(3)f(x,λ,β)=βλxλβ-1exp-xλβ,x⩾0,λ>0,β>0where λ is the scale parameter and β is the shape parameter.The cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of X can be found as:(4)F(x,λ,β)=1-exp-xλβ,x⩾0,λ>0,β>0Nelson (1982) illustrated that the Weibull distribution had some special expressions for the shape parameter. Hence, we consider the shape of Weibull distribution to manage product data are drawn from approximately normal or non-normal distribution.Based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution as Eq. (3), the LSE method is a widely-used by researchers to fit the shape and scale parameters. From Eq. (4), the sum of squares error (SSE) can be derived as:(5)ln[-ln(1-F(x(i)))]=βlnx(i)-βlnλ(6)SSE=∑i=1r[yi-βlnx(i)+βlnλ]2whereyi=ln[-ln(1-F^(x(i)))], the mean rank estimatorF^(x(i))=i/(r+1)(see Kapur and Lamberson (1977)), and the sample size r is given i=1, …, r. To fit the optimal value of β, we use various values of β when doing the “shape-first” approach to estimate λ based on the minimized SSE, as Eq. (6).Before using the PCI, many researches usually assumed that the product lifetime was fitted by a specific probability distribution. Tong et al. (2002) provided an approach to estimate the process performance of electronic components by creating a uniformly minimum variance unbiased (UMVU) estimator of a PCI CL, where a hypothesis testing procedure was proposed based on the complete set of samples with an exponential distribution. Liu and Chen (2006) used the Burr XII distribution to extend many PCIs for the non-normal product lifetime performance. The CLis defined as a lifetime performance index for estimating product performance (Montgomery, 1985) based on the two-parameter Weibull distribution that is introduced as follows.When a product is fitted by a two-parameter Weibull distribution, as Eq. (3), the lifetime performance index CLcan be expressed as follows:(7)CL=μ-Lσ=[λ·Γ(1+1/β)-L]/λ·M,-∞<CL<Γ(1+1/β)/Mwhere λ·Γ(1+1/β)=μ is the process mean, λ·M=σ is the process standard deviation, L is the lower specification limit, andM=Γ(1+2/β)-[Γ(1+1/β)]2. From Eq. (7), the lifetime performance index is CL>0 under the process mean λ·Γ(1+1/β)>L. When X exceeds the lower specification limit L, the data is defined as conforming data. The ratio of conforming data is known as the conforming rate Pr, defined as:(8)Pr=P(X⩾L)=exp-[Γ(1+1/β)-M·CL]β,-∞<CL<Γ(1+1/β)/MEq. (8) can be transformed into the following equation for CLas:(9)CL=Γ(1+1/β)-(-lnPr)1/βM,-∞<CL<Γ(1+1/β)/MIn this case, the experiment only observes a sample size r as X(1)<X(2)<⋯<X(r) with the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The2Q(Y)/λβ∼χ2r2can be shown by using the change in variables and additive property of the Chi-square distribution, whereQ(Y)=∑i=1r(r-i+1)·X(i)β-X(i-1)β, and X(0)≡0. Moreover, from the theorem in Lehmann and Scheffé (1950) we can acquire the following estimator:(10)C^L=Γ(1+1/β)-Γ(r)LΓ(r-1/β)[Q(Y)]1/βMIn fact, with a known beta, this is a UMVU estimator of CLandC^Lis consistent with CL, where the detailed proof is shown in Appendix B. When product is fitted by a two-parameter Weibull distribution, the estimatorC^Lis a very suitable testing estimator for the hypothesis testing of product lifetime.In the use ofC^L, a statistical testing procedure is developed here to assess whether the lifetime performance index adheres to the required level. Assuming that the required index value of lifetime performance is larger than c, which is denoted as the target value, the null hypothesis H0:CL⩽c, and the alternative hypothesis H1:CL>c are thus constructed by this. BecauseC^Lis the testing statistic for the UMVU estimator of CL, the rejection region can be expressed asC^L>C0, where the critical value of C0 is inferred under the specified level of significance α, as follows:Sup{CL⩽c}P(C^L>C0)⩽αGiven thatP2Q(Y)/λβ⩽2Γ(1+1/β)/M-cΓ(1+1/β)/M-C0·Γ(r)Γ(r-1/β)β=1-αandΓ(1+1/β)/M-cΓ(1+1/β)/M-C0·Γ(r)Γ(r-1/β)=[CHIINV(1-α,2r)/2]1/βwhere {[Γ(1+1/β)/M−c]/[Γ(1+1/β)/M−C0]}>0, and CHINV(1−α,2r) represents the lower 1−α percentile ofχ2r2, the critical value C0 can thus be derived as:(11)C0=Γ(1+1/β)/M-Γ(r)Γ(r-1/β)·Γ(1+1/β)/M-c[CHIINV(1-α,2r)/2]1/βPolicymakers can employ the above one-sided hypothesis testing procedure to estimate whether the lifetime performance index CLconforms to the required level. For the lifetime performance index CL, the proposed testing procedure can further be organized into the following steps:Step 1.Take the observed samples as X(1)<X(2)<⋯<X(r).Construct the null hypothesis H0:CL⩽c and the alternative hypothesis H1:CL>c with the performance index value c.Specify the level of significance α and the conforming rate Pr.Acquire the critical value C0 using Eq. (11) according to the target value c, the sample size r, and the level of significance α.Acquire the value of the testing statisticsC^Lby calculating Eq. (10).Set the decision rules of the statistical test as follows:WhenC^L⩽C0, conclude that the lifetime performance of the product does not conform to the required level.WhenC^L>C0, conclude that the lifetime performance of the product conforms to the required level.Obviously, the simplicity of the TPLP allows quality engineers conveniently assess whether a batch of product meets the requirement with a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Fig. 3shows clearly that our consideration is that the larger-the-better CLindex indicates a long product lifetime and represents a required product lifetime performance and vice versa.In general, a two-parameter Weibull distribution contains both unknown scale and shape parameters, and researchers are also interested in the latter. While many studies have provided approaches to estimate the shape of the two-parameter Weibull distribution with sufficient samples, it remains difficulty to do so when the sample size is small. Based on this, we propose a new approach to address this specific estimation problem in the following subsection.The MPV approach is mainly used to explore the best-fitting product distribution shape. First, we introduce the Gini statistics (Gail and Gastwirth, 1978), which is employed to construct a counter-intuitive statistical hypothesis testing procedure to estimate whether a product is fitted by a two-parameter Weibull distribution, as Eq. (3), under a given level of significance α and a sample size r. The proposed strategic testing procedure is constructed as follows:(1)The null hypothesis is set as:H0:β=β0The alternative hypothesis is set as:H1:β≠β0The testing statistics used as the Gini statistics is:(12)Gr=∑i=1r-1iWi+1(r-1)∑i=1rWiwhereWi=(r-i+1)·X(i)β-X(i-1)β, i=1, 2, …, r, and X(0)≡0a.The rejection region for a small data set such as 3⩽r⩽20 is set as:(13){Gr>ξ1-α/2orGr<ξα/2}where the critical value ξα/2 is the 100(α/2) percentile of the Grstatistic. Moreover, the p-value=P{∣Gr∣>∣gr∣∣β=β0}, where grrepresents the observed value of Grwhich has a c.d.f. as follows:(14)P(Gr⩽x)=xr-1∏i=1r-1ci-1-∑j=m+1r-1(x-cj)r-1·cj∏k≠jr-1(ck-cj)-1where cj=(r−j)/(r−1), and m is the largest index, such that x⩽cm. Note that the corresponding two-tailed percentiles ξα/2 of the Gini statistic Grare shown in Gail and Gastwirth (1978).The rejection region for a large data set such as r>20 is set as:(15){Gr>Z1-α/2orGr<Zα/2}where gris the observed value of [12(r−1)]1/2(Gr−0.5) which follows an approximately standard normal distribution N (0,1), as follows:(16)P|Z|>[12(r-1)]1/2(gr-0.5)|β=β0.The decision rule of the statistical test is designed as:When β=β0, the p-value has a maximal value, which means that there is strong evidence to accept the null hypothesis H0.Following this hypothesis testing procedure, the best fitted shape parameter β can be found.Virtual samples generation implies that potential information is explored to improve decision-making accuracy for small sample sizes. Therefore, we estimate a shape of small sample distribution and virtual samples are randomly drawn from the distribution. That is, this research proposes the MPV approach to approximately estimate a nonlinear and asymmetrical shape of small sample distribution for creating virtual data. The detailed procedures of the proposed approach are described as follows:Step 1.Given a data set which is fitted by the Weibull distribution as Eq. (3).Perform MPV to estimate a best-fitting β for the small sample set.Compute the scale parameter λ by the following equation for obtaining a reasonable distribution of the small sample set.(17)λ=exp-1β·1r∑i=1rln-ln1-F^(x(i))-βlnx(i)where the mean rank estimatorF^(x(i))=i/(r+1)(see Kapur and Lamberson (1977)) given i=1, …, r.Generate virtual samples according to the estimated Weibull distribution.A new data set with size rnewis composed of the real samples with size rrealand the virtual samples with size rvir(i.e., rnew=rreal+rvir). Repeat Steps 1–2, to obtain a new shape parameter β for the data set.The MPV is a reliable and stable approach based on statistical theory. In particular, this approach overcomes the problem of small sample size, such as 3⩽r⩽20. In addition, the proposed procedure offers a better shape parameter of small sample distribution. This fact is shown by using simulation data and two practical examples in the following sections. Note that the virtual samples are generated using the Compaq Visual Fortran, Professional Edition V6.6 Intel Version and IMSL computer software, based on above proposed procedures.
