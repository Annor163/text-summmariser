@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this article, we derive a solution for a linear stochastic model on a complex time domain. In this type of models, the time domain can be any collection of points along the real number line, so these models are suitable for problems where events do not occur at evenly-spaced time intervals. We present examples based on well-known results from economics and finance to illustrate how our model generalizes and extends conventional dynamic models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In many business disciplines, especially in economics and finance, researchers are interested in modeling dynamics of variables whose current values are influenced by their own expected future values. Perhaps the best known example of such a model is the Cagan (1956) model of hyperinflation. In that model, the current price level depends on how economic agents form expectations about the future price level. In finance, the current price of an asset can be modeled as a function of a future price of that asset.Generally, such models are expressed as(1.1)yt=aE[yt+1|It]+czt,where variableytis a linear function of its own expected future value, conditional onIt, the information set available at time t, and an exogenous variablezt, which can be either a deterministic or a random variable.This type of model served as a building block for many seminal works. Lucas (1973) employed this type of model to study output-inflation tradeoff. Sargent and Wallace (1975) used it to study the effectiveness of various monetary policies. Sargent (1977) and Taylor (1979) studied econometric methods for estimating a dynamic model with expectations. These works and many others shaped modern macroeconomics.Theoretical and empirical aspects of this model continue to receive attention in the literature. Blanchard and Kahn (1980), Broze, Janssen, and Szafarz (1984) and Gourieroux, Laffont, and Monfort (1982)analyzed solutions to general versions of this model which can include expectations of multiple future values and lags of y. Christiano (1987) discussed econometric issues pertaining to this type of model.In this paper, we generalize the model in (1.1) by allowing the time period between the current period and the period for which expectation is formed to be of any arbitrary length. A related work by Tucci (2004) takes a step in this direction by restating Cagan’s model using m-period future expectations:(1.2)yt=aEt[yt+m]+zt,wherem>1, so y is a function of not just a one-period-ahead expectation but an expectation at some arbitrary point in the future.The model we propose in this paper is(1.3)yt=aEtytσ+f(t,zt).The principal difference between the models in (1.1) and (1.2) is in how they approach timing of events. The time domain of (1.1) is a set of integers, so events in this model occur at evenly spaced time intervals. The time domain of (1.3) can be any collection of points onR+, the set of positive real numbers, andytandytσare values of y on two consecutive points on the time domain. Therefore, in (1.3),ytcan be a function of its expected value at any arbitrary point in the future, and the interval between point t and the next point on the time domain can vary over time. The models in (1.1) and (1.2) are special cases of the model in (1.3). Thus, the model in (1.3) is a generalization of existing models in the literature.In the next section, we present the theory behind the dynamic model used in this paper and derive the solution for the model in (1.3). Then we discuss two examples to draw parallels with existing models and to show how the model proposed in this paper contributes to the literature on dynamic modeling.LetT={0=t0,t1,t2,t3,…}be the set of positive real numbers such thatti<tjfori<j. Then we defineσ(ti)=ti+1andμ(ti)=σ(ti)-tiforti∈T. With these properties, the time domainTcan be considered as a complex discrete time domain.Let f be a real valued function defined onT. Then theΔ-derivative of f is defined asfΔ(t)=f(σ(t))-f(t)μ(t),wheret∈T. TheΔ-integral of f is defined as∫0Tf(τ)Δτ=∑s∈[0,T)∩Tμ(s)f(s),where0,T∈T.The exponential function onTis denoted asep(t,t0)=∏s∈[t0,t)∩T(1+μ(s)p(s)),where1+p(t)μ(t)≠0for allt∈T.IfT≔Zand p is a constant so that1+pμ(t)≠0for allt∈Z, thenep(t,t0)=(1+p)t-t0. The circle minus ofp(t),⊖p(t), is defined to be-p(t)1+μ(t)p(t)for allt∈Tκ. If1+pμ(t)>0, thenep(t,t0)>0for allt∈T(for details, see Merrell, Ruger, & Severs, 2004).With the help of these definitions we derive the general solution for the model (1.3) where f may be a linear or a nonlinear function. We then illustrate how our model and its solution generalize the existing results in the literature (Broze, Gourieroux, & Szafarz, 1985; Broze et al., 1984; Broze & Szafarz, 1984; Gourieroux et al., 1982; Pesaran, 1981). In the statement of the next theorem, we use the notation given in the paper (Merrell et al., 2004), and we drop the variable t ofμ(t), which appears in the subscripts ofe1-aaμ(t)ande⊖1-aaμ(t).Theorem 2.1LetTbe a complex discrete time domain. Then the followingytsolves the equation in(1.3)(2.1)yt=e1-aaμ(t,0)M(t)-e1-aaμ(t,0)∫0te⊖1-aaμ(s,0)1μ(s)f(s,zs)Δs,wheret∈TandM(t)is an arbitrary martingale onT, i.e. it satisfies the martingale propertyEt[Mσ(t)]=M(t).We start by shiftingytone step forward. Hence, we haveytσ=e1-aaμ(σ(t),0)Mσ(t)-e1-aaμ(σ(t),0)∫0σ(t)e⊖1-aaμ(s,0)1μ(s)f(s,zs)Δs.Sincee1-aaμσ(t,0)=1ae1-aaμ(t,0), it follows that(2.2)ytσ=1ae1-aaμ(t,0)Mσ(t)-1ae1-aaμ(t,0)∫0σ(t)e⊖1-aaμ(s,0)1μ(s)f(s,zs)Δs.Using properties of the integral, we write the above expression (2.2) asytσ=1ae1-aaμ(t,0)Mσ(t)-1ae1-aaμ(t,0)∫0te⊖1-aaμ(s,0)1μ(s)f(s,zs)Δs+∫tσ(t)e⊖1-aaμ(s,0)1μ(s)f(s,zs)Δs.Because∫tσ(t)e⊖1-aaμ(s,0)1μ(s)f(s,zs)Δs=e⊖1-aaμ(t,0)f(t,zt), we obtain(2.3)ytσ=1ae1-aaμ(t,0)Mσ(t)-1ae1-aaμ(t,0)∫0te⊖1-aaμ(s,0)1μ(s)f(s,zs)Δs+e⊖1-aaμ(t,0)f(t,zt).Next, multiplying each side of the above Eq. (2.3) by a and then applying the conditional expectation to each side, we obtain(2.4)aEtytσ=e1-aaμ(t,0)EtMσ(t)-e1-aaμ(t,0)∫0te⊖1-aaμ(s,0)1μ(s)f(s,zs)Δs+e⊖1-aaμ(t,0)f(t,zt).As a last step, we subtractaEtytσin (2.4) fromytin (2.1) side by side and we obtainyt-aEtytσ=e1-aaμ(t,0)Mt-EtMtσ+e1-aaμ(t,0)e⊖1-aaμ(t,0)f(t,zt).Becausee1-aaμ(t,0)e⊖1-aaμ(t,0)=1, we haveyt-aEtytσ=f(t,zt).This completes the proof.□IfT=Z, then the Eq.(2.1)becomes(2.5)yt=1atMt-1at∑s=0t-1asf(s,zs),whereMtis a discrete time martingale.Iff≡0, Eq. (1.3) is reduced toyt=aEtytσ,and the solution for y isyt=1atMt.Broze et al. (1985) show that the general solution to the model in (1.3) onT=Zis(2.6)yt=1ayt-1+εt0-1af(t-1,zt-1),whereεt0is an arbitrary martingale difference.Solution of the Eq. (2.6) coincides with the solution (2.1) forT=Z. To see this, first consider the case wheref≡0. Then the Eq. (2.6) becomes(2.7)yt=1ayt-1+εt0.By shifting the above Eq. (2.7) one unit forward and multiplying each side of the equation byat+1we have(2.8)at+1yt+1-atyt=at+1εt+10.Next, we sum each side of Eq. (2.8) from 0 tot-1and now we have∑s=0t-1Δ(asys)=∑s=0t-1as+1εs+10.This implies that(2.9)atyt=y0+∑s=0t-1as+1εs+10.The right hand side of the above equality (2.9) is a martingale. In fact, let’s callMt=y0+∑s=0t-1as+1εs+10.Then it is straightforward to see thatMtsatisfies the martingale property, i.e.EtMt+1-Mt=0.When f is non-zero, the Eq. (2.6) becomes∑s=0t-1Δ(asys)=Mt-∑s=0t-1asf(s,zs).This implies thatyt=a-t(Mt+y0)-a-t∑s=0t-1asf(s,zs).In this example we show that a well-known result in asset pricing literature – that, under risk-neutral probability measures, self-financing trading strategies are martingales – still holds when such a strategy is implemented on an arbitrary time domainT.A trading strategy is defined as(3.1)Vt(θ)=θtSt,whereVtis the value ofθtshares of a security with priceSt. (For a more-detailed exposition, we refer the readers to Ammann (2001)) The trading strategy is a sequence ofθ′s {θ0,θ1,…,θT}, and the initial investment isV0(θ)=θ0S0. Gains of a trading strategy are defined asGt(θ)=∑k=0t-1θt(Sk+1-Sk).A trading strategyθis called self-financing if the change in wealth is determined solely by capital gains and losses, i.e. if and only ifVt(θ)=V0(θ)+Gt(θ).In the absence of arbitrage, the expected return under a risk-neutral probability measure should be equal to the risk-free rate:Rf=EQ[R],where R is the return on the security S and Q inEQdenotes risk-neutral probability.Return onSbetween t andσ(t)is simplyRtσ=StσSt.Combining the last expression with the no-arbitrage condition yields(3.2)Rft=EtQStσSt.To find the gain inVtσ, we can multiply the right-hand side of (3.1) by return on S:(3.3)Vtσ=θtStStσSt.By adding and subtractingRftVt=θtStRft, we obtain(3.4)Vtσ=RftVt+θtStStσSt-Rft.Expected value ofVtσunder Q isEtQVtσ=EtQ[RftVt]+EtQθtStStσSt-Rft.Using the invariance property of the conditional expectation, we getEtQVtσ=RftVt+θtStEtQStσSt-Rft.Applying the no-arbitrage condition (3.2) results in(3.5)EtQVtσ=RftVt.Dividing both sides of (3.5) by R, we obtain(3.6)Vt=1RftEtQVtσ.Using Theorem (2.1), we can solve Eq. (3.6) and the solution is(3.7)Vt=eRft-1μ(t,0)M(t).Therefore, we can conclude that for anyTthe wealth of any self-financing strategy is a martingale under Q. We also can see that ifT=Z, the Eq. (3.7) becomesVt=1RftM(t).Next we present an example based on the Cagan model of hyperinflation. The purpose of the example is to illustrate flexibility offered by being able to use an arbitrary time domainT.Suppose the real demand for moneymtd-ptis a function of expected future inflation:mtd-pt=-α(Etptσ-pt),wheremdand p are logarithms of the nominal money demand and price level, respectively, andα>0. For convenience, assume that money supply is constantmts=1+αm.For the money market to be in equilibrium, it has to be true that1+αm-pt=-αEtptσ-pt,or(3.8)pt=α1+αEtptσ+m.Hence by Theorem (2.1), the solution of (3.8) is(3.9)pt=e1αμ(t,0)M(t)-e1αμ(t,0)∫0te⊖1αμ(s,0)1μ(s)mΔs.WhenT=Z,pt=1βtMt-1βt∑s=0t-1βsm,whereβ=α1+α.Therefore, the solution shown in (3.9) retains the familiar structure of this type of models while offering greater flexibility for modeling timing of events. For example, consider the following two time scales:T1={0,1,2,3,4,5}andT2=0,h,2h,3h,4,5, where0<h<1Both have five points, but the points of the former are unevenly spaced over time. Suppose further that we are interested in calculating the expected value ofp5given the information available inI0. Thus,E0p5=E0e1αμ(5,0)M(5)-E0e1αμ(5,0)∫05e⊖1αμ(s,0)1μ(s)mΔs=e1αμ(5,0)M0-e1αμ(5,0)∫05e⊖1αμ(s,0)1μ(s)mΔs=e1αμ(5,0)p0-e1αμ(5,0)∫05e⊖1αμ(s,0)1μ(s)mΔs.UnderT1, the last expression becomes(3.10)E0p5=e1α(5,0)p0-e1α(5,0)∫05e⊖1α(s,0)mΔs=1+αα5p0-1+αα5∑s=04α1+αsm=1+αα5p0-∑s=041+αα5-sm.UnderT2, the expected price level isE0p5=1+αα5p0-mα+1α51+α+1α-h+α+1α-2h+α+1α-3h+α+1α-4.As h approaches zero, the three middle terms in the bracket approach 1. Therefore, unlike theT1case where the effects of future m were a geometric average, ash→0in theT2case, m’s that occurred int={h,2h,3h}have the same effect onE0[p5]as m int=0. So, even though the total increase in money supply was the same inT1andT2, the timing of m has an effect on expected prices. This happens for a simple reason: Ash→0, them′sare not spread out over time but occur all at once neart=0.Although the above example is simple, it highlights the strengths of the model proposed in this paper:The model explicitly takes into account timing of events. In the context of Cagan’s model of hyperinflation, by varyingT, we can amplify or diminish the effect of future monetary injections on the price level by simply adjusting their timing.
