@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To augment the classification accuracy of the ultrasound computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for breast tumor detection based on texture feature, we proposed to extract texture feature descriptors by the shearlet transform. Shearlet transform provides a sparse representation of high dimensional data with especially superior directional sensitivity at various scales. Therefore, shearlet-based texture feature descriptors can characterize breast tumors well. In order to objectively evaluate the performance of shearlet-based features, curvelet, contourlet, wavelet and gray level co-occurrence matrix based texture feature descriptors are also extracted for comparison. All these features were then fed to two different classifiers, support machine vector (SVM) and AdaBoost, to evaluate the consistency. The experimental results of breast tumor classification showed that the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and Matthew's correlation coefficient of shearlet-based method were 91.0±3.8%, 92.5±6.6%, 90.0±3.8%, 90.3±3.8%, 92.6±6.3%, 0.822±0.078 by SVM, and 90.0±2.8%, 90.0±4.0%, 90.0±2.3%, 89.9±2.4%, 90.1±3.6%, 0.803±0.056 by AdaBoost, respectively. Most of the shearlet-based results significantly outperformed those of other method based results under both the classifiers. The results suggest that the proposed method can well characterize the properties of breast tumor in ultrasound images, and has the potential to be used for breast CAD in ultrasound image.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers for females in the world. According to the statistics in 2012, it is about 29% of all new cancer cases among women in the US, which is only second to lung and bronchus cancer, as the leading cause of female cancer deaths [1].Currently, ultrasound imaging has been widely used in the breast tumor detection in clinic, as ultrasound is an effective, convenient, inexpensive, real-time and radiation-free imaging tool [2,3]. Breast ultrasound computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is therefore becoming an increasingly important tool, which offers more objective evaluation results and improves the diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity [2,3]. Generally, the breast ultrasound CAD is composed of four stages, including image preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction and selection, and classification [3–5].Feature extraction and selection is one of the critical steps in breast ultrasound CAD [3,5]. The computerized feature used in breast ultrasound CAD is generally classified into morphologic feature and texture feature [4,6]. Although morphological feature is commonly used in breast ultrasound CAD, it needs image segmentation before feature extraction. Therefore, the effectivity depends on segmentation algorithm to a certain extension [6,7]. Textural variation in breast ultrasound image has been recognized as a very useful feature for distinguishing benign masses from malignant tumors [3,8,9]. Some existing CAD systems even have no image preprocessing and image segmentation components, and only extract texture feature for tumor classification [8,10].The ultrasound textures can be regarded as the regional intensity distribution features characterizing the scattering properties of ultrasonic RF echoes in B-mode images of breast tissues [9]. Traditionally, the texture feature descriptors are calculated using a variety of statistical, structural, spectral and model based techniques, such as auto-covariance coefficients [4,10], gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) [3,11], block difference of inverse probabilities [3,10], block variation of local correlation coefficients [3], fractal dimension [3] and complexity curve [11,12]. These methods can represent the statistical characteristics of gray level distribution in certain region of interest (ROI). One common advantage of these methods is that they can be implemented easily. However, these methods mainly extract textures feature from the spatial domain, but ignore the frequency domain and spatial-frequency domain properties of breast lesions, which in fact is very important to discriminate breast lesions in ultrasound images. Furthermore, most of these methods don’t have the multiscale properties of an image. As a natural characteristic of spatial-frequency method, the multiscale geometric analysis (MGA) allows a much more complete texture analysis through different scales [11–18].The wavelet transform is a powerful time-frequency (or spatial-frequency) analysis tool, and its applications are increasingly popular in science and engineering fields [19]. One typical application is used as texture feature extraction method, including from breast ultrasound images [3,8,9]. The traditional wavelet transform methods deal well with pointwise singularities by ignoring the geometric properties of structures (such as edge). However, they neither perform on multidimensional data, nor carry much directional information [20]. To overcome above limitations in traditional wavelet methods, the MGA method has been proposed based on the harmonic analysis theory [21], which provides more sparse representation and can deal well with the singularities of the high-dimensional data.In the past decade, many MGA algorithms have been developed, such as directionlet [21], brushlet [14], ridgelet [13], curvelet [22], contourlet [23], shearlet [20] and tetrolet [24]. All these algorithms have been successfully applied for image processing, including image denoising, image segmentation, and image fusion. Recently, several MGA algorithms, including brushlet, ridgelet, curvelet and contourlet, have shown the potential of application in extracting the texture features from different kinds of images, and promising performance has been achieved [11–18].Shearlet is a genuinely multidimensional and nonisotropic version of the traditional wavelet transform method, with an advantage in superior directional sensitivity at various scales [20]. Although still being conceptually close to wavelets, shearlet offers an enough flexible extension to precisely detect the position and orientation of singularities and to provide optimally sparse representations [20]. Shearlet has been widely used in image processing, such as sparse image representation [20], edge detection [25], image denoising [26] and image fusion [27]. However, to the best of our knowledge, limited work has been done on applying shearlet to extract texture features.Fig. 1shows the benign breast mass and malignant tumor. It can be found that the benign masses have the following characteristics: regular shape, sharp and definite boundary, circumscribed edge, mostly close to the major axis parallel to the horizontal, and homogeneous internal echoes; whereas the malignant tumors include irregular shape, indistinct boundary, lobular or angular edge, long axis vertical and horizontal, and posterior acoustic shadowing [6]. These characteristics can be represented by texture and morphological features. As shearlet has the advantage of directional sensitivity and localization property at various scales, we can extract effective texture feature descriptors with shearlet transform to distinguish the differences between benign mass and malignant tumor in ultrasound images in a better way.In this paper, we proposed a novel method that extracts texture feature descriptors based on shearlet transform to improve the performance of discriminating benign breast mass from malignant tumor in ultrasound image. As curvelet and contourlet share some similarities with shearlet, they both were adopted in our experiments together with the traditional wavelet and GLCM for evaluating the performance of shearlet-based features. Moreover, two commonly used classifiers, namely the support vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost, were also adopted to evaluate the consistency of the discriminative power of the shearlet-based texture feature descriptors.As the texture features are extracted from transformed images using shearlet, the shearlet transform is briefly introduced as follows [28].For ψ∈L2(R2), consider the 2-dimensional affine system(1){ψast(x)=|detMas|−1/2ψ(Mas−1x−t):t∈R2,Mas∈Γ}where Γ is the 2-parameter dilation groupΓ={Mas=aas0a:(a,s)∈R+×R}. We choose ψ such that(2)ψˆ(ξ)=ψˆ(ξ1,ξ2)=ψˆ1(ξ1)ψˆ2ξ2ξ1where ψ1 is a continuous wavelet, for whichψˆ1∈C∞(R)with suppψˆ1⊂[−2,1/2]∪[1/2,2]and ψ2 is chosen so thatψˆ2∈C∞(R), suppψˆ2⊂[−1,1], withψˆ2>0on (−1,1), and ||ψ2||=1. Under these assumptions, ψ is a continuous wavelet and for a∈R+, s∈R and t∈R2, Sf(a,s,t)=f,ψastwill be called the continuous shearlet transform of f∈L2(R).The elements of the affine system, which are called continuous shearlets, are oriented waveforms, whose orientation is controlled by the shear parameter s. They become increasingly elongated at fine scales (as a→0).By sampling the continuous shearlet transform Sf(a,s,t) on an appropriate discrete set, a discrete transform can be obtained, which is able to better deal with distributed discontinuities.Note that the matrix Mascan be factored asaas0a=1s01a00a. Thus, it will be “discretized” as Mjl=BlAj, whereB=1101,A=4002are the shear matrix and the anisotropic dilation matrix, respectively. Hence, the discrete shearlets are the functions of the form(3)ψj,l,k(0)(x)=23j/2ψ(BlAjx−k)whereψˆ(0)(ξ)=ψˆ(0)(ξ1,ξ2)=ψˆ1(ξ1)ψˆ2(ξ2/ξ1), withψˆ1,ψˆ2∈C∞(Rˆ), suppψˆ1⊂[−1/2,−1/16]∪[1/16,1/2]andψˆ2⊂[−1,1]. In addition, we assume that(4)∑j≥0|ψˆ1(2−2jω)|2=1for|ω|≥18and, for eachj≥0,(5)∑l=−2j2j−1|ψˆ2(2jω−l)|2=1for|ω|≤1From these assumptions it follows that the functionsψˆj,l,k(0)(with j≥0, −2j≤l≤2j−1, k∈Z2) form a tiling ofD0={(ξ1,ξ2):|ξ1|≥1/8,|ξ2/ξ1|≤1}, which is illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The frequency support of a shearletψj,l,ksatisfies parabolic scaling as is shown in Fig. 2(b). In very similar way, we construct a second set of discrete shearletsψˆj,l,k(1)(x)such that the set{ψˆj,l,k(1):j≥0−2j≤l≤2j−1,k∈Z2}is a tiling ofD1={(ξ1,ξ2):|ξ2|≥1/8,|ξ2/ξ1|≤1}(see Fig. 1(a)). Finally, letϕ∈L2(R2)be such that the set{ϕk(x)=ϕ(x−k):k∈Z2}is a tight frame forL2([−1/16,1/16]2)∨.As shearlet has some similarities to curvelet and contourlet, curvelet and contourlet based texture features were also extracted for comparison. Due to the paper length, we refer to [22,23] for the theories about curvelet and contourlet, respectively.Due to shearlet's directional sensitivity at various scales, we decomposed the breast ultrasound image by shearlet transform into three layers, and then extracted the following statistical descriptors as texture feature: (1) the entropy, correlation, contrast and angular second moment from the coefficient co-occurrence matrix of the first layer in horizontal cone; (2) the mean, variance and energy from both the first and third layer coefficients in the horizontal and vertical cones; (3) the maximal values in each column of the high frequency sub-band coefficient matrix.After the image was decomposed into four layers with curvelet transform, we extracted the following texture feature descriptors: (1) the entropy, correlation, contrast and angular second moment based on the coefficient co-occurrence matrix calculated from the low frequency sub-band in the first layer; (2) the mean, variance, energy of the high frequency sub-band in the first and third layers; (3) the maximal values in each column of the high frequency sub-band matrix.After the image was decomposed into four layers with contourlet transform, the texture feature descriptors include: (1) the entropy, correlation, contrast and angular second moment based on the coefficient co-occurrence matrix calculated from the low frequency sub-band; (2) the energy of the high frequency sub-band in the second, third and fourth layers; (3) the maximal values in each column of the high frequency sub-band matrix of the second, third and fourth layers.Since the Haar wavelet is commonly used in image processing, it was selected to decompose the breast ultrasound image to extract the following descriptors: (1) the entropy, correlation, contrast and angular second moment calculated from the co-occurrence matrix of the low frequency sub-band in the first layer; (2) the mean, energy of the high frequency sub-band matrix in the first layer; (3) the maximal values in each column of the high frequency sub-band matrix in the first layer.We calculate the GLCM at the 0° direction. Similarly, the entropy, correlation, contrast and angular second moment were calculated from the co-occurrence matrix, and the maximal values in each column were also obtained.In order to evaluate the characteristic performance of the aforementioned features, the extracted features by different methods were respectively fed to the classifier for discriminating the benign mass from malignant tumor. SVM and AdaBoost were adopted here to evaluate the consistency of these texture features. As both the classifiers are widely used, we refer the readers to [29–31] for the theories about SVM and AdaBoost, respectively.In our experiment, a total of 200 pathology-proved breast ultrasound images (including 100 benign masses and 100 malignant tumors) were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. These images were randomly selected from the Cancer Hospital of Fudan University by one of the authors. These images were acquired by the author and his colleagues from several ultrasound imaging devices by different manufacturers. The human subject ethical approval was obtained from the relevant committee in the Cancer Hospital of Fudan University before carrying out the experiment. Each subject provided a written consent prior to the experiment. To select the ROI, the position of mass was roughly located at the center of the original breast ultrasound image, and then the image was cropped to the size of 128×128. To estimate the performance of the proposed method, the four-fold cross-validation was applied. To keep the balance between benign and malignant image for the classifier, the ratios of benign images to malignant images was 1:1 in each fold.In order to quantitatively evaluate the performance of classification results with different features and classifiers, six common indexes were used, namely accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC). Their definitions are as follows:(6)Accuracy=TN+TPTN+FN+TP+FP(7)Sensitivity=TPTP+FN(8)Specificity=TNTN+FP(9)Positive predictive value(PPV)=TPTP+FP(10)Negative predictive value(NPV)=TNTN+FN(11)MCC=(TP×TN−FP×FN)[(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)]1/2where TP refers to the correct classification rate of malignant cases; FN is the misclassification rate of malignant cases; TN is the correct benign cases; FP indicates the misclassification rate of benign cases. The sensitivity is defined as the proportion of people with disease who will have a positive result, and it only shows how good the test is for identifying people with disease when only looking at those with disease. While the specificity of a test is the proportion of people without the disease who will have a negative result, and it can only be calculated from those people who do not have the disease. PPV is proportion of people with a positive test result who actually have the disease, while NPV is the proportion of people with a negative test result who do not have disease. The higher the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, PPV and NPV, the more successful the used method. The MCC is a correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted classifications in essence, whose value is between −1 and +1. For MCC coefficient, +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 indicates a uniform random prediction, and −1 denotes an inverse prediction [32]. Since the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve plots the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate, it provides a relative tradeoff between benefits (true positives) and costs (false positives). Therefore, ROC curve is also drawn and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is then calculated as an indicator of performance.A paired-samples t-test was used to statistically evaluate the performances of different texture features as well as the various classification algorithms. The results were declared statistically significant when associated with p-value that is less than 0.05. All statistical computations were carried out with the SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).All the algorithms were implemented using MATLAB 2009b (MathWorks, Massachusetts, USA) and performed on a Dell computer (2.66GHz/2G RAM).

In conclusion, we proposed a new texture feature extraction method based on shearlet transform for characterizing breast tumor in ultrasound image. The comparative experiment results indicated that the shearlet-based texture feature could more effectively characterize breast tumors in ultrasound image than other features extracted from curvelet, contourlet, wavelet and GLCM methods. It suggests that the shearlet-based texture feature has the potential to be used in the breast ultrasound CAD.
