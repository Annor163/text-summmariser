@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Automated detection of the various features of an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform has wide applications in clinical diagnosis. Although detection of typical QRS waveforms has been widely studied, detection of atypical waveforms with complex morphologies remains challenging. The importance of detecting these complex waveforms and their patterns has grown recently due to their clinical implications. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for detecting the various peaks of such complex ECG waveforms. It is identified that most of the well-formed ECG waveforms – both typical and complex – fall into nine broad categories according to the standard nomenclature. Motivated by this ECG waveform classification, our algorithm uses signal analysis techniques such as first and second derivatives and adaptive thresholds to classify these waveforms accordingly by detecting the various features present in them. Temporal coherence along a single lead as well as spatial coherence across the 12 leads are used to improve performance. For waveform and pattern analysis, data from 50 healthy subjects and 50 patients with myocardial infarction were randomly selected. Results with an overall sensitivity of 99.06% and overall positive predictive value of 98.89% validate the effectiveness of the approach. Further, the algorithm gives true detections even on waveforms with fluctuations in baseline and wave amplitudes, proving its robustness against such variations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely known as one of the most reliable and noninvasive tools for monitoring the heart rhythm. One heart rhythm or beat on an ECG signal consists of the P-QRS-T wave as seen in Fig. 1. The P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave respectively represent atrial depolarization (contraction of the upper heart chambers), ventricular depolarization (contraction of the lower heart chambers), and ventricular repolarization (relaxation of the lower heart chambers) [1].Apart from the main features of a single beat – P, QRS, and T waveforms – there are other points of interest especially for the purposes of clinical diagnosis. ST segment is defined as the segment between the end of the S wave and the start of the T wave. J point is defined as the junction between the QRS complex and the ST segment. [1,2]. Further, the isoelectric line is defined as the baseline of each ECG beat and is generally identified as the segment (1) between the end of the P wave and the start of the Q wave (PR), and (2) between the end of the T wave and the start of the P wave (TP). All these features have proven to be vital for the detection of many clinical conditions such as a myocardial infarction (MI) [3].The development of accurate and quick methods for automatic QRS detection is of major importance in automated ECG waveform analysis. For more than 30 years, many QRS detection algorithms have been proposed. Most commonly used algorithms in QRS detection are first derivative and/or filter based algorithms [4,5], neural network based algorithms [6,7], wavelet based algorithms [8–10], and independent component analysis (ICA) [11]. Among them it is reported that neural network, wavelet, and ICA based algorithms are computationally intensive. Alternatively, the first derivative based algorithms are widely utilized because of their low computational cost [4,5,10]. However, the current QRS detection algorithms are unable to identify various types of noise or disturbances and sudden changes in the complexes [11–14].Our previous study presented a QRS detection algorithm based on the use of simple pattern matching techniques [15]. The algorithm first classified the waveforms into five fundamental types, the most commonly observed ECG waveforms [16], as shown in Fig. 2. It then used properties such as the temporal correlation between successive ECG beats for the QRS detection in each category. The algorithm resulted in a true detection rate of 98.9% for typical ECG waveforms.However, the above mentioned algorithm was modeled for typical ECG waveforms and thus failed to identify additional waves of certain ECG waveforms, which have important clinical implications [17–22]. They have been clinically labeled as R′ (the second positive or upward wave) and S′ (the second negative or downward wave) as shown in Fig. 3[3,23]. These secondary waves are also referred to as notched R and notched S waves [24]. It has been reported that abnormal ventricular depolarization produces features such as R′ and S′ [17]. Irregularities of QRS, such as RSR′, RSS′, or RSR′S′ waveforms in the precordial leads can be explained by bundle branch blocks [17–21]. In addition, the presence of RSR′ waveforms may be an indicator of MI [22]. More recently the secondary R′ wave in the precordial leads has been associated with certain left ventricular pre-excitation [25]. Despite all these implications, only few studies have considered detection of such abnormal ECG waveforms. For example, Cheng et al. [23] put forward a detection algorithm based on correlation between the waveforms and author-defined templates. Misclassification and over-sensitivity were reported as drawbacks thus emphasizing the necessity for this research.This paper deals with detecting nine types of ECG waveforms shown in Figs. 2 and 4: QRS, QR, Q, RS, R, RSR′, QRSR′, RSR′S′, and QRSR′S′. These nine groups constitute majority of well-formed ECG waveforms. The details of the detection algorithm valid for these waveforms are explained in the next section.
