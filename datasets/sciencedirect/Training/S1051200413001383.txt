@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents the formulation and performance analysis of four techniques for detection of a narrowband acoustic source in a shallow range-independent ocean using an acoustic vector sensor (AVS) array. The array signal vector is not known due to the unknown location of the source. Hence all detectors are based on a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) which involves estimation of the array signal vector. One non-parametric and three parametric (model-based) signal estimators are presented. It is shown that there is a strong correlation between the detector performance and the mean-square signal estimation error. Theoretical expressions for probability of false alarm and probability of detection are derived for all the detectors, and the theoretical predictions are compared with simulation results. It is shown that the detection performance of an AVS array with a certain number of sensors is equal to or slightly better than that of a conventional acoustic pressure sensor array with thrice as many sensors.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Acoustic vector sensors (AVS) are different from traditional acoustic pressure sensors (APS) or hydrophones in that they measure the components of particle velocity in addition to the acoustic pressure [1]. AVS technology with co-located pressure and velocity sensors has grown rapidly in recent years due to the established superiority of AVS over APS in signal processing applications. This superiority stems from the fact that particle velocity measurements provide additional information about the acoustic field, viz., the direction of the impinging acoustic waves. While an APS array can extract directional information by measuring the propagation delay between sensors, a single AVS can obtain this information directly from the particle velocity measurements. These measurements also enable unambiguous bearing estimation of underwater sources using shorter and/or sparser AVS arrays, in contrast to APS arrays which suffer from several ambiguities [1–4].Velocity sensors per se are not new. They have been available and used for quite some time. However, the importance of simultaneous measurement of acoustic pressure and particle velocity was first demonstrated experimentally by DʼSpain et al. [4] in 1991, sparking interest in the development of acoustic vector sensors. Since then, several experimental setups such as the DIFAR array [5] and the recently conducted Makai experiment [6] have demonstrated the effectiveness of AVS. The impressive performance of vector sensors has been demonstrated in numerous signal processing applications such as source direction-finding and localization [3,7–26], tracking [27–29], communication [30–32], geo-acoustic inversion [33] and source detection [34,35]. The compactness and improved performance of AVS arrays make them ideal for use in fields such as underwater acoustic surveillance for port security [36] and underwater imaging [37].The initial theoretical framework for signal processing applications using an AVS array was developed by Nehorai and Paldi [1] who presented the AVS array measurement model for plane waves propagating in a homogeneous medium. Several theoretical treatments of the AVS followed, and numerous algorithms for direction-finding and localization of sources employing AVS have been developed. These include modifications of existing direction-of-arrival estimation (DOA) algorithms such as the Capon algorithm [3], MUSIC [10,38], ROOT-MUSIC [11], ESPRIT [8,9,12,13,16,17,38], MLE [18,19], and SIM [20,22] as well as other [23–26] algorithms. In a series of papers, Hawkes and Nehorai dealt with theoretical aspects of AVS signal processing, such as characterization of the AVS array performance in terms of error measures and the Cramer–Rao bound (CRB) [2,39], and characterization of intra-sensor and inter-sensor correlation of noise in an AVS array [40]. The performance bounds on direction finding using AVS have also been investigated by Tam and Wong [41]. Hawkes and Nehorai also illustrated how a distributed AVS array can function as a sensor network for localization [14]. In this setup, each AVS can function as a separate node of the network. Zha and Qiu [16] illustrated how the AVS could be employed for bearing estimation when the environment is contaminated by impulsive noise. Tichavsky et al. [13] demonstrated that a single AVS can be used for direction-finding of an acoustic source in far-field or near-field. Wu and Wong [21] have presented the near-field array manifold of the AVS, thus opening the doors for near-field AVS array signal processing applications. Later, they presented a method of near-field source localization using one triad of velocity sensors and one APS [23]. The problem of tracking source azimuth using an AVS was studied by Felisberto et al. [27]. Zhong et al. [28] explored the possibility of two-dimensional DOA tracking of acoustic sources with AVS using particle filtering. The feasibility of using AVS in underwater acoustic communications was demonstrated by Song et al. [30,31] and Abdi et al. [32]. The AVS may also be employed as an effective measurement system for the estimation of geo-acoustic parameters [33].Work on the development of algorithms for signal detection in shallow ocean using an AVS array is of recent origin [34,35]. In [34] and [35], the authors have proposed several detection strategies such as the energy detector (ED), subspace detector (SD), truncated subspace detector (TSD) and approximate signal form detector (ASFD), for narrowband detection of a source in a range-independent ocean with Gaussian ambient noise. All detectors are based on a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) [42] since the array signal vector is unknown due to the unknown location of the source. The ED is formulated assuming that the signal vector is completely unknown. The SD, which is formulated using the matched subspace detection approach [43], exploits the fact that the signal vector belongs to a low-dimensional modal subspace. Subspace detection is a well-discussed problem in the literature [44–46], starting with the works of Scharf and Lytle [44] who applied the theory of invariance in hypothesis testing to the problem of CFAR signal detection. The classic paper by Scharf and Friedlander [43] on matched subspace detection generalized the class of problems for detecting a subspace signal and showed that the GLRT yields a maximal invariant, uniformly most powerful detector. This work has also been extended to the problem of adaptive subspace detection [47–49]. Subspace detection has also been studied for signals in spherically invariant random vector noise [50] and generalized Gaussian noise with interference [51].In the context of underwater source detection, the SD provides a better performance than the ED. But the SD requires the knowledge of the modal wavenumbers of the underwater channel while the ED does not require any prior information. A modification of the SD, namely the TSD, seeks to optimize the detector by truncating the dimension of the modal subspace. The ED, SD and TSD methods can be employed with either AVS or APS arrays; but AVS arrays provide a significantly better detection performance than APS arrays. The ASFD, which is applicable to AVS arrays only, exploits the fact that a simple approximate relation exists between the components of measurement at each AVS. Neither the ED nor the ASFD assume any knowledge of the channel, but the ASFD provides a better performance than that of the ED. An extension of the above-mentioned detection strategies to the problem of detection in non-Gaussian noise has been explored recently in [52].This paper presents improved versions of methods developed in [35] for narrowband detection of an acoustic source using an AVS array in a range-independent ocean with Gaussian environmental noise. We undertake a detailed theoretical investigation of these methods, that is missing in [35]. The performance analysis of the detectors is based on several performance measures and simulation studies. We also discuss and illustrate the performance improvement obtained by these detection methods by exploiting the advantages of the AVS array in comparison to the APS array. The paper is organized as follows. The data models for a horizontal linear array (HLA) and a vertical linear array (VLA) of AVS are presented in Section 2. A detailed formulation of several alternative detection strategies is presented in Section 3. The issue of optimization of the TSD is also discussed in this section. In Section 4, the theoretical performance analysis of the detectors is presented for the case of finite data as well as the case of asymptotically large data records, and the relative merits and demerits of the different detectors are discussed. Theoretical and simulation results are presented and compared in Section 5. A summary and conclusions are presented in Section 6.We consider the problem of using an N-element AVS array for the detection of a narrowband point source with a center frequency f, using T snapshots of data. The ocean is modeled as a range-independent channel, having a water column of densityρwand sound speedcwover sediment of densityρband sound speedcb. The source is located at azimuth ϕ, depthzsand range r with respect to the reference element of the array. The sensor array is assumed to be in the far-field region with respect to the source, i.e.2π(f/cw)r≫1. We consider the uniform HLA and uniform VLA configurations for detection. In the case of an HLA, the sensor closest to the source is considered to be the reference sensor whereas in the case of a VLA the topmost sensor is considered to be the reference. The elements of the array are separated by a uniform distance of d meters. The source azimuth angle is measured with respect to the endfire direction of the HLA and an arbitrary direction for the VLA.Each AVS in the array has three outputs, viz., the acoustic pressure and two orthogonal horizontal components of particle velocity. The vertical component of particle velocity is not considered since the inclusion of this additional measurement is found to increase the complexity of the detection algorithm without yielding any significant additional improvement in performance. We shall scale the velocity components by the factor2ρwcwto maintain dimensional uniformity of the measured quantities and also to ensure that all the noise components have equal variance [20]. Letx(t),s(t)andw(t)denote, respectively, the tth snapshot of the3N×1data vector, signal vector and noise vector at the N-sensor AVS array. The signal vectors(t)can be represented as(1)s(t)=[s1(t),…,s3N(t)]T,s3n−2(t)=pn(t),s3n−1(t)=2ρwcwvxn(t),s3n(t)=2ρwcwvyn(t),n=1,…,N,wherepn(t)denotes the complex amplitude of acoustic pressure at the nth sensor, and(vxn(t),vyn(t))denote the corresponding complex amplitudes of the horizontal(x,y)components of particle velocity. According to the normal mode theory of sound propagation, the acoustic field in the channel can be expressed as the sum of a discrete spectrum of propagating normal modes and a continuous spectrum of evanescent normal modes [53]. For a source in the far-field region, the contribution of the continuous spectrum can be neglected and the expression for the acoustic pressurepn(t)can be written as(2)s3n−2(t)=pn(t)=∑m=1Mpmn(t),wherepmn(t)is the contribution of the mth mode to the acoustic pressure at the nth sensor, given by(3)pmn(t)=B(t)Ωmn(ϕ)ψm(zn)ψm(zs)exp(ikmr−ζmr)/kmr,(4)Ωmn(ϕ)={exp(i(n−1)kmdcos(ϕ))for HLA,1for VLA,wherekmandζmare the modal wavenumber (real part of the eigenvalue) and attenuation coefficient (imaginary part of the eigenvalue) of the mth normal mode at frequency f,ψm(z)is the normalized eigenfunction of the mth normal mode,znis the depth of the nth sensor andB(t)is a slowly varying complex quantity whose root-mean-square magnitude is proportional to the strength of the source. For a given channel, the number of propagating modes M is, in general, an increasing function of the signal frequency.The relation between acoustic pressure p and particle velocityvat a pointr=(x,y,z)at time t is governed by the law of conservation of momentum(5)ρwdvdt+∇p=0.In most applications of practical interest, the source is located in the far-field, satisfying the conditionkmr≫1for all m. Using (2), (4) and (5), and invoking the far-field condition, and definingk=2πf/cw, we can write(6)s3n−1(t)=2ρwcwvxn(t)=2cos(ϕ)∑m=1M(km/k)pmn(t),(7)s3n(t)=2ρwcwvyn(t)=2sin(ϕ)∑m=1M(km/k)pmn(t).Hence the tth snapshot of the signal vector can be expressed as(8)s(t)=A(ϕ)b(t),whereA(ϕ)is a3N×Mmodal steering matrix andb(t)is the mode amplitude vector. In the case of an HLA (denoted by the subscript H),b(t)andA(ϕ)are defined as(9)bH(t)=B(t)[ψ1(za)ψ1(zs)exp(ik1r−ζ1r)/k1r⋯ψM(za)ψM(zs)exp(ikMr−ζMr)/kMr]T,(10)AH(ϕ)=[a1,H(ϕ)⋯aM,H(ϕ)],wherezais the array depth and{am,H(ϕ),m=1,…,M}are the modal steering vectors for the HLA, defined as(11)am,H(ϕ)=dm(ϕ)⊗gm(ϕ),(12)dm(ϕ)=[1exp(ikmdcos(ϕ))⋯exp(i(N−1)kmdcos(ϕ))]T,(13)gm(ϕ)=[12cos(ϕ)(km/k)2sin(ϕ)(km/k)]T,where the symbol ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product. In the case of a VLA (denoted by the subscript V),b(t)andA(ϕ)are defined as(14)bV(t)=B(t)[ψ1(zs)exp(ik1r−ζ1r)/k1r⋯ψM(zs)exp(ikMr−ζMr)/kMr]T,(15)AV(ϕ)=[a1,V(ϕ)⋯aM,V(ϕ)],and the modal steering vectors for a VLA are defined as(16)am,V(ϕ)=[ψm(z1)gmT(ϕ)⋯ψm(zN)gmT(ϕ)]T.The signal is assumed to be contaminated by additive temporally white Gaussian noise. Let the noise vector at the nth sensor of the AVS array be denoted by[w3n−2(t)w3n−1(t)w3n(t)]T. For a given time t, the three components of noise at an AVS are uncorrelated and identically distributed [20]. But the noise is spatially correlated and it has a depth-dependent variance. Let the correlation matrix of the noise vectorw(t)be denoted by(17)Rw=E[w(t)wH(t)]=σ2R0,whereσ2is the variance of each component of noise at the reference depthz1andR0is a3N×3Nmatrix. The spatial correlation decays rapidly in the horizontal direction, and it can be ignored when the horizontal separation between sensors isλw/2(half-wavelength) or larger. But the vertical spatial correlation between similar components of noise remains strong even at large distances. Hence, for an HLA at depthz1, the matrixR0is given by(18)R0,H=I3N,whereI3Nis the3N×3Nidentity matrix, and for a VLA whose elements are located at depthsz1,…,zN, the matrixR0is given by [54](19)R0,V=[r(z1,z1)⋯r(z1,zN)⋯⋯⋯r(zN,z1)⋯r(zN,zN)]⊗I3,where(20)r(zk,zn)=∑m=1Msin(γmzk)sin(γmzn)∑m=1Msin2(γmz1),whereγm=(k2−km2). The vertical spatial correlation functionr(z1,z1+Δ)is shown in Fig. 1for a shallow iso-velocity ocean whose parameters are listed in Section 5. Fig. 1(a) shows a plot ofr(z1,z1+Δ)versus Δ forz1=10mand frequencyf=350Hz. Fig. 1(b) shows the variation of the correlation with frequency forz1=10mandΔ=λw, whereλw=cw/fis the wavelength in water. It is seen from these figures that the correlation is small forΔ⩾λw, and exhibits small irregular fluctuations with frequency. Hence, for a VLA, it is desirable to choose inter-sensor spacingd≅λwto minimize the degradation of detector performance due to inter-sensor noise correlation. In the following analysis, we shall assume that the matrixR0is known for both HLA and VLA. The varianceσ2is generally not known.In this section, we shall present several alternative methods for detecting a narrowband source. The detection problem can be cast in the form of the following binary hypothesis testing problem:(21)H0:x˜(t)=w˜(t),H1:x˜(t)=s˜(t)+w˜(t),t=1,…,T,whereHjdenotes the hypothesis that j sources are present, and(22)x˜(t)=R0−1/2x(t),s˜(t)=R0−1/2s(t),w˜(t)=R0−1/2w(t),are the pre-whitened versions of the data vector, signal vector, and noise vector respectively. The joint likelihood functions of T snapshots of the data vector under hypothesesH0andH1are given by(23)f(X|σ2;H0)=1(πσ2)3NTexp[−1σ2∑t=1Tx˜H(t)x˜(t)],(24)f(X|σ2,S;H1)=1(πσ2)3NTexp[−1σ2∑t=1T(x˜(t)−s˜(t))H(x˜(t)−s˜(t))],whereX=[x˜T(1),…,x˜T(T)]T,S=[s˜T(1),…,s˜T(T)]T. The logarithm of the likelihood ratio (LR) is given by(25)logL(X)=1σ2∑t=1T[2Re(x˜H(t)s˜(t))−s˜H(t)s˜(t)].The primary hurdle faced in the detection of a signal in the ocean is that the signal vectors{s(t),t=1,…,T}at the sensor array are unknown due to lack of knowledge of the source location and other uncertainties in source, receiver or environment parameters. Hence we perform a generalized likelihood ratio test after replacing each vectors˜(t)in (24) by its maximum likelihood (ML) estimatesˆ(t). The ML estimate may use any prior information that may be available. The different detectors presented in this paper use different types of prior information. The noise varianceσ2is also not known in general. Sometimes, it may be possible to obtain a prior estimate ofσ2from noise-only data. If a reliable a priori estimate ofσ2is not available, it has to be treated as an additional unknown parameter. Hence we shall consider the detection problem for two different cases, viz. (a) the noise varianceσ2is known, and (b)σ2is unknown.For case (a), the logarithm of the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) is obtained from (25) on replacings˜(t)bysˆ(t). Hence the test statistic for this case can be written as(26)γCase(a)(X)=∑t=1T[2Re(x˜H(t)sˆ(t))−sˆH(t)sˆ(t)],where the signal-vector estimatessˆ(t)are different for different detectors, andRe(⋅)denotes the real part of(⋅).For case (b), the following estimates ofσ2underH0andH1are readily obtained by maximizing the likelihood functions in (23) and (24):(27)σˆ02=13NT∑t=1Tx˜H(t)x˜(t),σˆ12=13NT∑t=1T[x˜(t)−sˆ(t)]H[x˜(t)−sˆ(t)].On substituting (27) into (23) and (24) respectively, we get the following expression for GLR for case (b):(28)LG,Case(b)(X)=[σˆ02σˆ12]3NT,and further simplification yields the following expression for the test statistic:(29)γCase(b)(X)=∑t=1Tx˜H(t)x˜(t)∑t=1T[(x˜(t)−sˆ(t))H(x˜(t)−sˆ(t))].We shall now introduce the different detectors and discuss their performance in detail.It is well known that, if{s(t),t=1,…,T}andσ2are known, the optimal detector in the Neyman–Pearson sense is the replica-correlator which may be implemented as a matched filter detector (MFD) [42]. Even though this case is of little practical interest, we shall consider it solely for the purpose of comparison since the performance of the MFD provides an upper bound on the performance of other realizable detectors. In this case, the log-likelihood ratio in (25) leads to the following likelihood ratio test (LRT): DecideH1ifγMFD(X)>η, where η is the detection threshold, and(30)γMFD(X)=∑t=1TRe(x˜H(t)s˜(t))is the test statistic of the MFD.If{s(t),t=1,…,T}are totally unknown, the ML estimate ofs˜(t)is given by(31)sˆED(t)=x˜(t)for allt.If the noise varianceσ2is known, the test statistic is given by(32)γED(X)=∑t=1Tx˜H(t)x˜(t).This is the well-known energy detector (ED) [42], and it is presented here only for the sake of comparison.We note for later reference that the normalized mean-square signal estimation error (NMSE), defined asεED=Δ∑t=1TE[(sˆED(t)−s˜(t))H(sˆED(t)−s˜(t))]∑t=1TE[s˜H(t)s˜(t)],is given by(33)εED=3NTλ,(34)λ=Esσ2,Es=∑t=1TE[s˜H(t)s˜(t)],whereEsis the total energy of the modified signal vectors˜(t)summed over all the snapshots, and λ is the signal energy to noise power ratio (ENR).The GLRT does not provide a meaningful solution if the signal is completely unknown and the noise variance is also unknown.The ED described in Section 3.2 assumes no prior information about the structure of the signal vector. It is possible to achieve better performance by using any prior information that may be available. One such detector is the subspace detector (SD) [34,35]. This detector is based on the fact that the 3N-dimensional signal vector belongs to an M-dimensional modal subspace. We shall present here a simpler formulation of the subspace detector and its theoretical performance analysis.We know that the pre-whitened signal vector can be expressed ass˜(t)=R0−1/2s(t)=R0−1/2A(ϕ)b(t), whereA(ϕ)=[a1(ϕ)⋯aM(ϕ)]is the3N×Mmodal steering matrix and{am(ϕ),m=1,…,M}are modal steering vectors defined in (10) and (11) or (15) and (16) respectively. Here and in the sequel, we omit the subscripts H and V for the sake of brevity. The columns ofA(ϕ)are linearly independent if3N⩾M. Assuming that3N⩾Mthe 3N-dimensional signal vectors˜(t)belongs to the M-dimensional modal subspaceV(ϕ)spanned by the columns ofR0−1/2A(ϕ), i.e.(35)V(ϕ)=span{R0−1/2a1(ϕ)⋯R0−1/2aM(ϕ)}=span{u1(ϕ)⋯uM(ϕ)},where{u1(ϕ)…uM(ϕ)} is the orthonormal basis ofV(ϕ)obtained through a Gram–Schmidt transformation process. We note thats˜(t)depends on ϕ though this dependence is generally suppressed for the sake of brevity. The signal vectors˜(t)may therefore be expressed as(36)s˜(t;ϕ)=U(ϕ)β(t),U(ϕ)=[u1(ϕ)⋯uM(ϕ)].The M-dimensional vectorβ(t)and the bearing ϕ are unknown. For a given ϕ, the subspaceV(ϕ)is known if the modal wavenumbers{km,m=1,…M}are known in the case of an HLA, and if the modal wavenumbers{km,m=1,…,M}as well as the mode functions{ψm(z),m=1,…,M}are known in the case of a VLA. Assuming that this information is available, the problem of estimating the 3N-dimensional signal vectors˜(t)is reduced to the problem of estimating the M-dimensional vectorβ(t)and the bearing ϕ. The conditional ML estimator ofβ(t)is given by(37)βˆ(t|ϕ)=[UH(ϕ)U(ϕ)]−1UH(ϕ)x˜(t)=UH(ϕ)x˜(t).Hence, for a given ϕ, the estimate ofs˜(t;ϕ)can be written as(38)sˆSD(t|ϕ)=U(ϕ)βˆ(t|ϕ)=D(ϕ)x˜(t),where(39)D(ϕ)=U(ϕ)UH(ϕ)is the projection matrix onto the subspaceV(ϕ). On replacings˜(t)bysˆSD(t|ϕ)in the likelihood function (24) and maximizing with respect to the unknown parameter ϕ, we get the following estimate of ϕ:(40)ϕˆSD=argmax[∑t=1Tx˜H(t)D(ϕ)x˜(t)].From (38), the unconditional estimate ofs˜(t)can be written as(41)sˆSD(t)=D(ϕˆSD)x˜(t).On substituting (41) into (26) and (29), we obtain the following expressions for the test statistic for case (a) (σ2known) and case (b) (σ2unknown)(42)γSD,Case(a)(X)=∑t=1Tx˜H(t)D(ϕˆSD)x˜(t),(43)γSD,Case(b)(X)=∑t=1Tx˜H(t)D(ϕˆSD)x˜(t)∑t=1Tx˜H(t)(I3N−D(ϕˆSD))x˜(t).The SD method presented in Section 3.3 can be employed only if the columns ofA(ϕ)are linearly independent, i.e. ifM⩽3N. Since the number of modes M increases as the frequency is increased [53], the applicability of SD is limited by an upper cut-off frequencyfcthat increases with the number of sensors N; a longer array (larger N) is required for detection of signals of higher frequency. Moreover, it is observed that, for a given array length N, the performance of SD suffers degradation as the signal frequency f is increased even iff<fc. This progressive degradation can be explained by considering the normalized mean-square signal estimation error (NMSE)εSDεSD=Δ∑t=1TE[(sˆSD(t)−s˜(t))H(sˆSD(t)−s˜(t))]∑t=1TE[s˜H(t)s˜(t)].It can be readily shown thatεSD=MTσ2+E[∑t=1Ts˜H(t;ϕ)(I3N−D(ϕˆSD))s˜(t;ϕ)]Es,whereEsis the total signal energy,ϕˆSDis defined in (40). The quantitys˜H(t;ϕ)(I3N−D(ϕˆSD))s˜(t;ϕ)is equal to zero if the estimateϕˆSDis equal to the true value ϕ. We may therefore assume thatE[∑t=1Ts˜H(t;ϕ)(I3N−D(ϕˆSD))s˜(t;ϕ)]is small compared toMTσ2to arrive at the following result(44)εSD=MTλ,where λ is the ENR defined in (34). The NMSE increases linearly with increasing M and hence it increases with increasing frequency.In order to extend the applicability of the SD to shorter arrays/higher frequencies and also to arrest the degradation associated with increasing frequency, we propose a detector called truncated subspace detector (TSD) which uses a truncated model of the signal vector obtained by projectings˜(t,ϕ)onto a truncated modal subspace defined as(45)V′(ϕ)=span{R0−1/2a1(ϕ)⋯R0−1/2aM′(ϕ)}=span{u1(ϕ)⋯uM′(ϕ)},M′<M.The set of spanning vectors ofV′(ϕ)is a subset of the set of spanning vectors of the full modal subspaceV(ϕ)defined in (35). The truncated signal vectors˜′(t,ϕ)can be written as(46)s˜′(t,ϕ)=R0−1/2A′(ϕ)b′(t)=U′(ϕ)β′(t),where(47)A′(ϕ)=[a1(ϕ)⋯aM′(ϕ)],U′(ϕ)=[u1(ϕ)⋯uM′(ϕ)].The conditional ML estimator of theM′-dimensional vectorβ′(t)is given by(48)βˆ′(t|ϕ)=U′(ϕ)Hx˜(t).Hence, for a given ϕ, the estimate ofs˜(t,ϕ)can be written as(49)sˆTSD(t|ϕ)=U′(ϕ)βˆ′(t|ϕ)=D′(ϕ)x˜(t),where(50)D′(ϕ)=U′(ϕ)U′(ϕ)His the projection matrix onto the truncated modal subspaceV′(ϕ). Expressions for the estimate of ϕ and the unconditional estimate ofs˜(t)can be obtained using a procedure analogous to that for SD described in Section 3.3. Thus we get(51)ϕˆTSD=argmax[∑t=1Tx˜H(t)D′(ϕ)x˜(t)],(52)sˆTSD(t)=D′(ϕˆTSD)x˜(t).It can be readily shown that the NMSE of the signal estimator defined in (52) is given by(53)εTSD(M′,ϕ)=Δ∑t=1TE[(sˆTSD(t)−s˜(t))H(sˆTSD(t)−s˜(t))]∑t=1TE[s˜H(t)s˜(t)]=εTSD(1)(M′)+εTSD(2)(M′,ϕ),where(54)εTSD(1)(M′)=M′Tλ,(55)εTSD(2)(M′,ϕ)=E[∑t=1Ts˜H(t;ϕ)(I3N−D′(ϕˆTSD))s˜(t;ϕ)]Es≅1−E[∑t=1Ts˜H(t)D′(ϕ)s˜(t)]Es=1−λ′λ,where(56)λ′=Es′σ2,Es′=∑t=1TE[s˜′(t)Hs˜′(t)].In (56),Es′is the total energy of the truncated signal vectors over all snapshots andλ′is the ENR for the truncated signal. The NMSEεTSD(M′,ϕ)has two componentsεTSD(1)(M′)andεTSD(2)(M′,ϕ). The first componentεTSD(1)(M′)is the error due to noise, and it is analogous to the MSEεSDdefined in (44). Eq. (54) indicates thatεTSD(1)(M′)decreases linearly as the number of retained modesM′is reduced. The second componentεTSD(2)(M′,ϕ)is the error due to truncation of the normal mode expansion of the signal vector.It is seen from (55) thatεTSD(2)(M′,ϕ)=0whenM′=M. AsM′is reduced,εTSD(2)(M′,ϕ)increases, but this increase is very slow. Illustrative plots of the total MSE and its components versus the number of retained modesM′are shown in Fig. 2for a 6-sensor HLA and three different values of SNR viz. 0, 10 and 30 dB. Similar plots for a 6-sensor VLA are shown in Fig. 3for −10, 0 and 10 dB. The signal frequency is 350 Hz and the number of modes isM=15. The channel parameters, array parameters, and source position for these figures are the same as those listed in Section 5. It is seen from Figs. 2 and 3 that, asM′is reduced from M to 1, the total MSEεTSD(M′,ϕ)reduces and reaches a minimum at an optimal value ofM′which is quite small (especially in the case of the HLA), and may even be equal to 1. Let the optimal value ofM′be denoted byMopt′. We note thatεTSD(Mopt′,ϕ)is significantly smaller thanεSD. We can therefore expect the performance of TSD to be significantly better than that of SD. The use of a truncated signal model in TSD also has the additional advantages of (1) reducing the need for channel information to modal wavenumbers of the firstM′modes only, and (2) reducing the computational complexity.The value ofMopt′depends primarily on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the degree of correlation among the modal steering vectors{a1(ϕ)⋯aM(ϕ)}, and the total number of modes M, and to a lesser extent on the channel parameters, and the location of the source. In general, the value ofMopt′for the HLA is smaller than that for the VLA since the modal steering vectors of the HLA are more highly correlated than those of the VLA. It is seen from (54) that the rate of reduction ofεTSD(1)(M′)with decreasingM′becomes higher if λ is reduced. Consequently, the value ofMopt′decreases as λ is reduced. Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate the dependence ofMopt′on the more commonly used measure of SNR defined in (104). It is seen thatMopt′has a larger value at higher SNR, and also that the values ofMopt′for an HLA are smaller than those for a VLA.The errorεTSD(2)(M′,ϕ)due to truncation of the modal expansion is small because (1) the modal vectors{a1(ϕ)⋯aM(ϕ)} in the expansion ofs˜(t,ϕ)are highly correlated, and (2) amplitudes of the discarded higher order modes are generally quite small due to faster attenuation of the higher order modes. LetPM′am(ϕ)denote the projection ofam(ϕ)on the truncated modal subspaceV′(ϕ)form>M′. TheL2norm of the projection error vector is given by(57)EM′,m(ϕ)=‖am(ϕ)−PM′am(ϕ)‖2.It can be readily shown thatEM′,m(ϕ)increases as|ϕ−π/2|is increased. Hence,EM′,m(ϕ)is maximum atϕ=0. The proximity betweenV(ϕ)andV′(ϕ)is illustrated in Fig. 4, which shows plots ofEM′,m(0)versus m at frequency of 350 Hz for a 6-sensor HLA and four different values ofM′, viz.M′=1,2,3,4. The channel parameters, signal frequency, and source range-depth have the same values as in Section 5. It is evident that the difference between the full modal subspaceV(ϕ)and the truncated modal subspaceV′(ϕ)is negligible for all m and for allM′>2. It follows that the signal vector may be modeled using a drastically truncated modal subspace without causing a significant modeling error. This conclusion can be tested by considering the modeling error due to approximation of the signal vectors˜(t,ϕ)by its truncated versions˜′(t,ϕ)defined in (46). TheL2norm of the modeling error vector is given by(58)KM′(ϕ)=‖s˜(ϕ)−s˜′(ϕ)‖2.In (58), the dependence of the signal vector on t is suppressed. Fig. 5shows the plots ofKM′(0)versusM′for a 6-sensor HLA and also for a 6-sensor VLA for 3 different values of SNR. All the other parameters have the same values as in Fig. 4. It is seen from Fig. 5 that the signal modeling error due to modal subspace truncation is negligible forM′⩾3for the HLA andM′⩾7for the VLA. Consequently, the optimal value ofM′for minimizing the mean-square signal estimation errorεTSD(M′,ϕ)is very small for an HLA and somewhat larger for a VLA.Expressions for the test statistics for TSD can be obtained using a procedure similar to that for SD described in Section 3.3. Thus we get(59)γTSD,Case(a)(X)=∑t=1Tx˜H(t)D′(ϕˆTSD)x˜(t),(60)γTSD,Case(b)(X)=∑t=1Tx˜H(t)D′(ϕˆTSD)x˜(t)∑t=1Tx˜H(t)(I3N−D′(ϕˆTSD))x˜(t).The SD and TSD seek to achieve better performance than that of the ED by exploiting the knowledge of the modal wavenumbers. If this information is not available, it is still possible to achieve better detection than that of the ED by using the knowledge of the structure of the vectorgm(ϕ)(see (13)) associated with each AVS. Since the modal wavenumbers are subject to fairly tight bounds, viz.1>k1/k>⋯>kM/k>cw/cb, wherecw= sound speed in water,cb=sound speed in the ocean bottom, andk=2πf/cw, we may use the approximationkm/k≈1for all m and hence approximategm(ϕ)as(61)gm(ϕ)≈g(ϕ)=[12cos(ϕ)2sin(ϕ)]T.This approximation considerably simplifies the detection problem and leads to a much simpler detection algorithm which we refer to as the approximate signal form detector (ASFD) [35]. The signal vectors˜(t,ϕ)=R0−1/2s(t,ϕ)can now be approximated as(62)s˜″(t,ϕ)=R0−1/2H(ϕ)p(t),where(63)H(ϕ)=IN⊗g(ϕ)=[h1(ϕ)⋯hN(ϕ)]is a3N×Nmatrix with linearly independent columns, andp(t)=[p1(t)⋯pN(t)]Twherepn(t)denotes the acoustic pressure at the nth sensor. The approximate signal vectors˜″(t,ϕ)belongs to the N-dimensional subspaceV″(ϕ)defined as(64)V″(ϕ)=span{R0−1/2h1(ϕ)⋯R0−1/2hN(ϕ)}=span{u1″(ϕ)⋯uN″(ϕ)},where{u1″(ϕ)⋯uN″(ϕ)}is the orthonormal basis ofV″(ϕ). We can therefore rewrite (62) as(65)s˜″(t,ϕ)=U″(ϕ)β″(t),whereU″(ϕ)=[u1″(ϕ)⋯uN″(ϕ)].The signal vector approximation defined in (62), (63), and (65) is qualitatively different from that defined in (46). The approximation in (46) involves truncation of the normal mode expansion, whereas (62) and (63) involve an approximation of the relation among the components of the signal vector measured by an AVS. In (46), the unknown vectorβ′(t)isM′-dimensional, whereas the unknown vectorβ″(t)in (65) is N-dimensional. The conditional ML estimate ofβ″(t)and the corresponding estimate ofs˜(t,ϕ)are given by(66)βˆ″(t|ϕ)=U″(ϕ)Hx˜(t),(67)sˆASFD(t|ϕ)=D″(ϕ)x˜(t),(68)D″(ϕ)=U″(ϕ)U″(ϕ)H.Expressions for the estimate of ϕ and the unconditional estimate ofs˜(t)can be obtained using a procedure analogous to that for SD and TSD. Thus we get(69)ϕˆASFD=argmax[∑t=1Tx˜H(t)D″(ϕ)x˜(t)],(70)sˆASFD(t)=D″(ϕˆASFD)x˜(t).The NMSE of the signal estimator defined in (70) is given by(71)εASFD(ϕ)=Δ∑t=1TE[(sˆASFD(t)−s˜(t))H(sˆASFD(t)−s˜(t))]∑t=1TE[s˜H(t)s˜(t)]=εASFD(1)+εASFD(2)(ϕ),where(72)εASFD(1)=NTλ,(73)εASFD(2)(ϕ)=E[∑t=1Ts˜H(t;ϕ)(I3N−D″(ϕˆASFD))s˜(t;ϕ)]Es≃1−E[∑t=1Ts˜H(t)D″(ϕ)s˜(t)]Es=1−λ″λ,(74)λ″=Es″σ2,Es″=∑t=1TE[s˜″(t)Hs˜″(t)].In (74),Es″is the total energy of the approximate signal vectorss˜″(t)over T snapshots andλ″is the ENR of the approximate signal. The NMSEεASFD(ϕ)also has two componentsεASFD(1)andεASFD(2)(ϕ). The first componentεASFD(1)is the error due to noise, and it is analogous to the NMSE componentεTSD(1)defined in (54). The second componentεASFD(2)(ϕ)arises from the signal modeling error due to the approximation (61). We haveεASFD(1)=13εEDwhile the other componentεASFD(2)(ϕ)is quite small in comparison toεASFD(1)(ϕ)because the approximation in (61) introduces only a small error. It follows thatεASFD≃13εED. Hence the ASFD is expected to perform better than the ED. This prediction is confirmed by the asymptotic analysis in Section 4.6 and the simulation results presented in Section 5.Expressions for the test statistics of ASFD, which are analogous to the corresponding expressions for SD and TSD, are given by(75)γASFD,Case(a)(X)=∑t=1Tx˜H(t)D″(ϕˆASFD)x˜(t),(76)γASFD,Case(b)(X)=∑t=1Tx˜H(t)D″(ϕˆASFD)x˜(t)∑t=1Tx˜H(t)(I3N−D″(ϕˆASFD))x˜(t).For the MFD, the probability of detectionPDand probability of false alarmPFAare given by [42](77)PFA=Q(η/Esσ22),PD=Q(Q−1(PFA−2λ)),whereEsis the energy of the pre-whitened signal summed over all snapshots andλ=Es/σ2is the signal energy to noise power ratio (ENR) defined in (34),Q(⋅)denotes the right-tail probability function of the standard normal distribution andQ−1(⋅)denotes the inverse of this function.The test statisticγEDof the ED, defined in (32), is the total energy of the pre-whitened data vectors. It is the sum of squares of6NTindependent Gaussian random variables with varianceσ2/2under both hypotheses. UnderH0, the means of these random variables are zero; and underH1, the sum of their means is equal toEs=∑t=1TE[s˜H(t)s˜(t)]. It follows that, under hypothesisH0, we have(2σ2γED)∼χ6NT2, i.e., the random variable2σ2γEDhas chi-squared distribution with6NTdegrees of freedom, and under hypothesisH1, we have(2σ2γED)∼χ6NT′2(2λ), which is a noncentral chi-squared distribution with6NTdegrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter 2λ. Thus we have(78)PFA,ED=Qχ6NT2(2ησ2),(79)PD,ED=Qχ6NT′2(2λ)(2ησ2),where the right-hand sides of (78) and (79) denote the right-tail probability functions of the respective distributions.Derivation of expressions forPDandPFArequires determination of the probability density functions (PDFs) of the test statistic under both hypotheses. The test statistic is defined in (42) for case (a), noise variance known, and in (43) for case (b), noise variance unknown. It is difficult to determine the PDFs since the test statistics are highly nonlinear functions of the data. But we can determine approximate expressions for the PDFs by assuming that the estimateϕˆSDis equal to the true value ϕ. Validity of this approximation is discussed in Section 5. We note thatx˜H(t)D(ϕ)x˜(t)is a quadratic form involving a complex circular Gaussian random vectorx˜(t),D(ϕ)is an idempotent matrix of rank M, and(80)s˜H(t)D(ϕˆSD)s˜(t)≅s˜H(t)D(ϕ)s˜(t)=s˜H(t)s˜(t)=Es.We can apply Graybillʼs theorem [55] to find the probability distribution of the quadratic formx˜H(t)D(ϕ)x˜(t). With this, it can be readily shown that(2σ2γSD,Case(a))∼χ2MT2underH0, and(2σ2γSD,Case(a))∼χ2MT′2(2λ)underH1. Therefore, the expressions forPFAandPDunder case (a) can be written as(81)PFA,SD,Case(a)=Qχ2MT2(2ησ2),(82)PD,SD,Case(a)=Qχ2MT′2(2λ)(2ησ2).In case (b), the matricesD(ϕˆSD)andI3N−D(ϕˆSD)in the numerator and denominator of (43) are idempotent matrices of rank M and3N−Mrespectively. Hence, on applying Graybillʼs theorem [55,56], we find that the numerator of (43), scaled by the factor(2/σ2), has chi-squared distribution with2MTdegrees of freedom under hypothesisH0and noncentral chi-squared distribution with2MTdegrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter 2λ underH1. The denominator of (43), scaled by the factor (2/σ2), has chi-squared distribution with(6N−2M)Tdegrees of freedom under both hypotheses sinces˜H(t)(I3N−D(ϕˆSD))s˜(t)=0in view of (80). The numerator and denominator of (43) are statistically independent since they represent the squares of the norms of projections ofx˜(t)onto mutually orthogonal subspaces. It follows that under hypothesisH0the test statistic defined in (43) has F distribution denoted byF2MT,(6N−2M)T, and under hypothesisH1it has noncentral F distribution with noncentrality parameter 2λ, denoted byF2MT,(6N−2M)T′(2λ). Hence the expressions forPFAandPDcan be written as(83)PFA,SD,Case(b)=QF2MT,(6N−2M)T(η),(84)PD,SD,Case(b)=QF2MT,(6N−2M)T′(2λ)(η),whereQF(.)andQF′(.)denote the right-tail probability functions of the respective distributions.As in the case of SD, we can once again determine the approximate distributions of the test statistics, defined in (59) and (60), under the assumption thatϕˆTSD=ϕ. Before proceeding further, we note some important differences between SD and TSD. It can be shown that(85)s˜H(t)D′(ϕ)s˜(t)=s˜′H(t)s˜′(t),wheres˜′(t)=U′β′(t)is the truncated signal vector defined in (46). It follows thats˜H(t)D′(ϕ)s˜(t)≠s˜H(t)s˜(t), whereass˜H(t)D(ϕ)s˜(t)=s˜H(t)s˜(t). Also,rank(D′(ϕ))=M′, whereasrank(D(ϕ))=M. Hence, we have(2σ2γTSD,Case(a))∼χ2M′T2underH0, and(2σ2γTSD,Case(a))∼χ2M′T′2(2λ′)underH1, and(86)PFA,TSD,Case(a)=Qχ2M′T2(2ησ2),(87)PD,TSD,Case(a)=Qχ2M′T′2(2λ′)(2ησ2),whereλ′is the ENR for the truncated signal defined in (56). For case (b), the numerator of (60), scaled by the factor (2/σ2), has chi-squared distribution with2M′Tdegrees of freedom under hypothesisH0, and noncentral chi-squared distribution with2M′Tdegrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter2λ′underH1. The denominator of (60), scaled by the factor (2/σ2), has chi-squared distribution with(6N−2M′)Tdegrees of freedom under hypothesisH0and noncentral chi-squared distribution with(6N−2M′)Tdegrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter2(λ−λ′)underH1. The numerator and denominator are statistically independent. It follows that under hypothesisH0the test statistic defined in (60) has F distribution denoted byF2M′T,(6N−2M′)T, and under hypothesisH1it has a doubly noncentral F distribution denoted byF2M′T,(6N−2M′)T″(2λ′,2λ−2λ′). Hence the expressions forPFAandPDcan be written as(88)PFA,TSD,Case(b)=QF2M′T,(6N−2M′)T(η),(89)PD,TSD,Case(b)=QF2M′T,(6N−2M′)T″(2λ′,2λ−2λ′)(η),whereQF(⋅)andQF″(⋅)denote the right-tail probability functions of the respective distributions.The test statistics of ASFD for cases (a) and (b), given by (75) and (76), are analogous to the corresponding test statistics for the TSD, withD′(ϕ)replaced byD″(ϕ). SinceD″(ϕ)is an idempotent matrix of rank N, the expressions forPFAandPDare similar to those for the TSD. Thus we have(90)PFA,ASFD,Case(a)=Qχ2NT2(2ησ2),(91)PD,ASFD,Case(a)=Qχ2NT′2(2λ″)(2ησ2),(92)PFA,ASFD,Case(b)=QF2NT,4NT(η),(93)PD,ASFD,Case(b)=QF2NT,4NT″(2λ″,2λ−2λ″)(η),whereλ″is defined in (74).The performance analysis in the five preceding subsections is based on3NTdata samples provided by an AVS array of N sensors over T snapshots. It is of interest to also consider an asymptotic (3NT→∞) performance analysis since such an analysis facilitates an easy comparison of the performance of different detectors and provides a better insight into their relative merits. For case (a) and a given ϕ, the test statistics of the detectors, defined in (32), (42), (59), and (75) are asymptotically (3NT→∞) Gaussian. Hence, if the noise variance is known, the asymptotic expression for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of each detector can be written as [42](94)PD,Case(a)∼Q(ν0ν1Q−1(PFA)−μ1−μ0ν1)=Q(Q−1(PFA)−δτ),where ∼ denotes asymptotic equality in the above expression, and(95)τ=ν1ν0,δ=μ1−μ0ν0,μj=E[γ;Hj],νj2=var(γ;Hj),j=0,1.In (94),μjandνjare respectively the mean and standard deviation of γ under hypothesisHj, τ is the ratio of standard deviations, and δ is the parameter known as the deflection coefficient. It is seen from (94) that, for a givenPFA, the probability of detectionPDincreases when δ and/or τ increases. Hence the relative magnitudes of δ and the relative magnitudes of τ provide measures for comparing the performance of the different detectors under consideration.For the case of known noise variance, each detector has a test statistic of the form defined in (26) which is reproduced below:γCase(a)(X)=∑t=1T[2Re(x˜H(t)sˆ(t))−sˆH(t)sˆ(t)].Using the expressions forsˆ(t)for different detectors defined in (31), (41), (52) and (70), and noting thatx˜(t)=w˜(t)underH0andx˜(t)=s˜(t)+w˜(t)underH1, we can obtain the following resultsμ0,ED=3NTσ2,μ1,ED=Es+3NTσ2,(96)ν0,ED2=3NTσ4,ν1,ED2=2σ2Es+3NTσ4,(97)τED=1+2λ3NT,δED=λ3NT,μ0,SD=MTσ2,μ1,SD=Es+MTσ2,(98)ν0,SD2=MTσ4,ν1,SD2=2σ2Es+MTσ4,(99)τSD=1+2λMT,δSD=λMT,μ0,TSD=M′Tσ2,μ1,TSD=Es′+M′Tσ2,(100)ν0,TSD2=M′Tσ4,ν1,TSD2=2σ2Es′+M′Tσ4,(101)τTSD=1+2λ′M′T,δTSD=λ′M′T,μ0,ASFD=NTσ2,μ1,ASFD=Es″+NTσ2,(102)ν0,ASFD2=NTσ4,ν1,ASFD2=2σ2Es″+NTσ4,(103)τASFD=1+2λ″NT,δASFD=λ″NT.We can draw some useful conclusions from Eqs. (96)–(103). We recall that3N>M>M′. It follows from (97) and (99) thatδSD>δEDandτSD>τED. It can be readily verified that the signal energy-to-noise power ratios (ENRs) λ (for the signal vectors˜) andλ″(for the approximate signal vectors˜″) are very close to each other. It can also be verified that the value ofλ′(ENR of the truncated signal vectors˜′) decreases very slowly asM′is reduced, and the rate of reduction ofλ′becomes large only at very small values ofM′. Therefore, it follows from (101) that the values ofδTSDandτTSDkeep increasing asM′is reduced until an optimal value ofM′is reached, as shown in Fig. 6. (We recall that a different criterion of optimality, viz., minimization of the normalized mean-square signal estimation errorεTSD, was considered in Section 3. The two criteria may lead to slightly different optimal values ofM′.) It is seen from Fig. 6 thatδTSD>δSDandτTSD>τSDas long as the truncation of the signal vector in TSD is not too severe. We may therefore make the following predictions: (1) TSD performs better than SD, which in turn performs better than ED, and (2) the performance of TSD keeps improving asM′is reduced from M to 1, till it reaches its optimal value. In the case of ASFD, it is obvious from (97) and (103) thatδASFD>δEDandτASFD>τED, and therefore we can predict that ASFD performs better than ED. The performance of ASFD relative to that of the SD and TSD depends on the relative magnitudes of N, M andM′. It is seen from (99) and (103) thatδASFD>δSDandτASFD>τSDifM>N. Consequently ASFD performs better than SD ifM>N, and worse than SD ifM<N. It is seen from (101) and (103) thatδTSD>δASFDandτTSD>τASFDifM′<N. For HLA, optimal value ofM′is very close to 1 and therefore optimalM′is almost always less than N. Hence, for HLA, TSD with optimalM′performs better than ASFD almost always. For VLA, it turns out that optimalM′≅Nand consequently, for optimalM′,δTSD≅δASFDandτTSD≅τASFD. Therefore, for VLA, the performance of ASFD is very close to that of TSD with optimalM′.In order to illustrate the conclusions and predictions of the preceding paragraph, we shall consider an example withN=6,T=20,f=350Hz,M=15, andSNR=−10dB. SNR (in dB) is defined as(104)SNR=10log10(1N∑n=1N|pn|2σn2),wherepnandσn2are respectively the signal component of acoustic pressure and the variance of noise at the nth sensor. Only the pressure components of signal and noise are considered in the definition of SNR as per normal convention [20], to facilitate a fair comparison between the performance of AVS and APS (acoustic pressure sensor) arrays. Values of the channel parameters and source coordinates used in this example are the same as those listed in Section 5. For TSD, we have chosen the optimal values ofM′, which turn out to beM′=1for the HLA andM′=5for the VLA as shown in Fig. 6. For this example, we have the following values of ENRs:λ=35.03,λ′=34.44(forM′=1), andλ″=35.02for the HLA, andλ=29.02,λ′=24.86(forM′=5), andλ″=28.96for the VLA. Values of δ, τ, the normalized mean-square signal estimation error ε, and the asymptotic probability of detectionPD(for false alarm probabilityPFA=0.001) for different detectors are tabulated in Table 1. The values of δ, τ, andPDconfirm the predictions of the preceding paragraph. We also note that a reduction in the value of ε is almost always accompanied by an increase in the value ofPD, as expected. For VLA, we haveδTSD=2.486<δASFD=2.644andτTSD=1.224>τASFD=1.218in the present example. On substituting these values of δ and τ in (94), we see thatPDof ASFD is larger thanPDof TSD if{Q−1(PFA)−2.486}/1.224>{Q−1(PFA)−2.644}/1.218, i.e. ifPFA>Q(34.72). SinceQ(34.72)≪1, it follows thatPDof ASFD is larger thanPDof TSD for almost all values ofPFA. It is however emphasized that, under different conditions,PDof TSD–VLA with optimalM′may be higher than that of ASFD–VLA, but the difference in performance is always small.Additional results based on the same example are provided in Figs. 6 and 7. Fig. 6 shows the variation ofδTSDandτTSDwithM′for different values of SNR. For an HLA, the values ofδTSDandτTSDare maximized atM′=1, whereas for a VLA, they are maximized atM′=5. It is also seen from Fig. 6 that the maximum values ofδTSDandτTSDfor the VLA are consistently smaller than those for the HLA at all values of SNR. Hence, for the TSD, the performance of an HLA may be expected to be consistently better than that of a VLA. The variation of δ and τ with SNR for different detectors is shown in Fig. 7. In this figure, plots for TSD are shown for the optimal values ofM′, viz.Mopt′=1for the HLA andMopt′=5for the VLA. Fig. 7 confirms once again that, ifN<M<3NandM′is optimal, we haveδTSD>δASFD>δSD>δEDandτTSD>τASFD>τSD>τEDfor HLA, andδASFD≅δTSD>δSD>δEDandτASFD≅τTSD>τSD>τEDfor VLA.It is known that the number of modes M increases as the frequency is increased. It follows from (99) that bothδSDandτSDreduce with increasing frequency. We may therefore expect the performance of the SD to degrade as the frequency is increased till M reaches the threshold 3N. For all other detectors, the performance is expected to be independent of frequency. All predictions in the preceding paragraphs will be verified through simulation results presented in Section 5.If noise variance is not known (case (b)), the test statistics defined in (43), (60) and (76) converge asymptotically to ratios of independent Gaussian random variables with non-zero means. The asymptotic PDFs of the test statistics have complicated expressions which do not provide any useful insights. Therefore, we shall not pursue the asymptotic analysis of case (b).This section presents a detailed study of the performance of all the detectors. The ocean is modeled as a Pekeris channel [53] comprising a homogeneous water layer of constant depth over a fluid half-space. The following values of channel, source and array parameters have been assumed unless otherwise stated: ocean depthh=70m, sound speed in watercw=1500m/s, sound speed in ocean bottomcb=1700m/s, density of waterρw=1000kg/m3, density of ocean bottomρb=1500kg/m3, attenuation in ocean bottomζ=0.2dB/λb, whereλb=cb/fis the wavelength in the ocean bottom, number of sensorsN=6for both HLA and VLA, array depthz1=40mfor HLA andz1=15mfor topmost sensor in the VLA, inter-sensor spacingd=λw/2=15/7m, whereλw=cw/fis the wavelength in water, source at ranger=5000m, depthzs=40m, bearingϕ=20°with respect to the endfire direction of the HLA, and frequencyf=350Hz. At this frequency, the number of normal modes in the channel isM=15. It is assumed that the signal does not vary from one snapshot to another. Detection is done usingT=20snapshots of data, and the probability of false alarm is fixed atPFA=0.001.Before presenting the results, we recall that the ED and the ASFD do not require any prior information about the channel. The TSD requires the knowledge of wavenumbers ofM′lowest order modes and the SD requires the knowledge of all the modal wavenumbers if an HLA is deployed. If a VLA is used, the SD and TSD require the knowledge of the modal eigenfunctions also, in addition to the modal wavenumbers.Fig. 8shows the theoretical plots ofPDversus SNR atPFA=0.001for different detectors for the case of known noise variance (case (a)). The non-asymptotic results ((77)–(79), (81)–(82), (86)–(87), (90)–(91)) are shown as dashed lines and the asymptotic results ((94) in conjunction with (96)–(103)) are shown as solid lines. The TSD results have been obtained using values ofM′that minimize the NMSEεTSD. Performance of the unrealizable MFD is also shown to indicate the upper bound onPDfor any realizable detector. It is seen that the asymptotic and non-asymptotic results exhibit the same trend, even though there are some quantitative differences between the two sets of results. Among the realizable detectors, the ranking of HLA-based detectors in decreasing order of performance is TSD, followed by ASFD, SD, and ED. For VLA-based detectors, the order of TSD and ASFD is reversed. These results are consistent with the values of the deflection coefficient δ shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6, and are in conformity with the predictions in Section 4.6. It is noteworthy that the ASFD, that does not require any channel information, compares favorably with the TSD that requires the knowledge of wavenumbers/eigenfunctions of the lowestM′modes of the channel. The ASFD compensates for the lack of channel information by exploiting the knowledge of an approximate relationship among different components of the signal measured by an AVS. The performance of the SD is poor even though it uses the modal wavenumber/eigenfunction information of all the M modes. This is so because the number of modes M is large and hence the NMSE of the SD is high, which leads to a degradation in performance. The performance of the ED is the poorest because it does not use any prior information.In Fig. 9, the theoretical (non-asymptotic) results (dashed lines) are compared with simulation results (solid lines). For, SD, TSD and ASFD, two types of simulation results are considered, viz. simulations of realizable detectors that do not assume prior knowledge of the bearing ϕ (solid lines), and simulations of unrealizable detectors which assume that ϕ is known (dotted lines). The variance of noise is assumed to be known (case (a)). The theoretical results are based on the expressions forPFAandPDgiven in Sections 4.1–4.5. The following observations can be made from Fig. 9. For MFD and ED, the simulation results match the theoretical predictions very closely. In the case of SD, TSD and ASFD, there is very good agreement between theoretical results and the simulation results that are based on the assumption that ϕ is known. But thePDof the realizable versions of these detectors are significantly lower than the theoretical predictions at low SNR. The difference between theoretical predictions and actual performance can be explained as follows. The theoretical results are based on the assumption that the bearing estimatesϕˆSD,ϕˆTSDandϕˆASFDmay be approximated by the true value ϕ. This assumption has been made to simplify the theoretical analysis. But the means and standard deviations of the bearing estimation errors keep increasing as SNR is reduced, as illustrated in Fig. 10which shows the variation of the (a) bias and (b) root-mean-square error of the bearing estimates of the SD, TSD and ASFD with variation in the SNR. Consequently, for SD, TSD and ASFD, the gap between theoretical predictions and actual performance also keeps increasing as SNR is reduced. Even though the theoretical results tend to overestimate the actual performance, the former provide a useful insight into the comparative performance of different detectors.It is also of interest to compare the performance of HLA-based detectors (Figs. 8(a) and 9(a)) and VLA-based detectors (Figs. 8(b) and 9(b)). It is seen that the performance of an HLA-based detector is better than that of a similar VLA-based detector. One reason for this difference is that noise at the sensors of the HLA is i.i.d., whereas noise at the sensors of the VLA is correlated and it has spatially varying variance. The whitening transformation leads to a reduction of the energy of the VLA signal vector and a consequent reduction in the performance of all VLA-based detectors. In the case of the TSD, there is an additional reason for the better performance of HLA. The optimal value ofM′for the HLA is lower than that for the VLA due to the higher degree of correlation among the modal steering vectors of the HLA. Therefore the NMSEεTSDfor the VLA is higher than that for the HLA, and the higher NMSE translates into a lower detector performance. Finally, it is seen from Fig. 10 that (1) for SD and TSD, the bearing estimation error of a VLA-based detector is larger than that of a similar HLA-based detector, and (2) for ASFD, the bearing estimation errors of HLA and VLA are almost the same. Therefore, for SD and TSD, the actual differences between the performance of HLA-based and VLA-based detectors (shown in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b)) are larger than the theoretically predicted differences (shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)).Fig. 11shows a comparison of theoretical (finite data) and simulation performances of TSD, ASFD and SD for the case of unknown noise varianceσ2(case (b)). A comparison of Figs. 9 and 11 shows that lack of knowledge ofσ2causes degradation in performance of all the detectors. But the degradation is less severe in the case of TSD. It is well known that this degradation can be arrested by employing secondary data vectors which are statistically identical to the noise-only data vectors.We shall now study the variation of detector performance with frequency. Fig. 12shows simulation results for the variation of probability of detectionPDwith frequency f, forPFA=0.001andSNR=−9dB. All the other parameters have the values mentioned at the beginning of this section. Whenf=30Hz, the number of normal modes M is equal to 1, and thus the SD and the TSD are equivalent. As f is increased, M increases and consequently the performance of the SD suffers a progressive degradation. Forf>120Hz, we haveM>N=6, and hence the performance of the SD dips below that of the ASFD. Atf=398Hz,M=3N=18, and the performance of SD is the same as that of ED. At still higher frequencies M is greater than 3N, and hence the SD cannot be used for detection. The performance of the other detectors does not vary with frequency. These results are in agreement with the predictions at the end of Section 4.6.In the context of source localization applications, the superiority of AVS arrays over acoustic pressure sensor (APS) arrays has been well established [3,7–23]. It is therefore interesting to compare the detection performance of AVS and APS arrays. Such a comparison is shown in Fig. 13. It is seen from Fig. 13(a) that for the ED, the performance of the 6-sensor AVS HLA is equal to that of the 18-sensor APS HLA. This result can be explained by noting that the performance of the ED depends only on the ENR λ, and that the ENR at an N-sensor AVS array is equal to the ENR at a 3N-sensor APS array. However, in the case of the TSD, the performance of the 6-sensor AVS HLA is slightly better than that of the 18-sensor APS HLA. This difference is attributed to the superior bearing estimation capability of the AVS array due to additional directivity provided by the velocity measurements of the AVS [57]. Better bearing estimation translates into a better estimation of the signal vector and thus a better detection performance. These twin advantages of an AVS array, viz. higher SNR and directivity, over an APS array of the same size N and aperture (=(N−1)dfor a uniform linear array) are recognized and documented in the literature on AVS array signal processing [3,57]. The ability of an N-sensor AVS array to attain the same level of performance as a 3N-sensor APS array is a result of great practical interest. In an array-based measurement system, a considerable portion of the cost is related to the construction, deployment and location calibration of sensor packages, and these costs depend on the number of sensor packages deployed [3]. Therefore, a reduction from 3N sensor packages in an APS array to N sensor packages in an AVS array will lead to a significant cost reduction. Moreover, in a towed array system, the drag on the towed array depends on the length of the array [58]. The drag can be reduced considerably if an APS array is replaced by a shorter AVS array.
