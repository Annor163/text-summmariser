@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This article is concerned with event-triggered fuzzy control design for a class of discrete-time nonlinear networked control systems (NCSs) with time-varying communication delays. Firstly, a more general mixed event-triggering scheme (ETS) is proposed. Secondly, considering the effects of the ETS and communication delays, based on the T-S fuzzy model scheme and time delay system approach, the original nonlinear NCSs is reformulated as a new event-triggered networked T-S fuzzy systems with interval time-varying delays. Sufficient conditions for uniform ultimately bound (UUB) stability are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In particular, the quantitative relation between the boundness of the stability region and the triggering parameters are studied in detail. Thirdly, a relative ETS is also provided, which can be seen as a special case of the above proposed mixed ETS. As a difference from the preceding results, sufficient conditions on the existence of desired fuzzy controller are derived to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system with reduced communication frequency between sensors and controllers. Moreover, a co-design algorithm for simultaneously determining the gain matrices of the fuzzy controller and the triggering parameters is developed. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed ETS and the effectiveness of the controller design method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Control systems in which the different components (i.e., sensors, controllers, and actuators) are physically distributed at different locations and connected through a shared communication networks are called networked control systems (NCSs). Low cost, easy maintenance, and system flexibility have dramatically stimulated the use of wired or wireless shared networks in a great number of real world applications, for example, sensor networks, remote surgery, and intelligent transportation systems [17]. However, although NCSs have a distinct advantage over the tranditional point-to-point control systems, the introduction of communication networks in control loops brings some challenging problems such as network-induced delays and/or packet dropouts, which may degrade system performance or even cause instability [58]. In the past decade, how to deal with these typical issues in NCSs has become an active research area, and a number of important results on modeling, control, and opimization of NCSs have been reported in the existing literature. According to the controlled plants in the published work, the results can be simply classified into two types: some results are focus on linear NCSs, see, for example, [11,12,30,35,41,42,45–49,52,57]; others are for nonlinear NCSs, see, for example, [5,8,13,16,18,23,40,54,55]. It should be pointed out, however, that these pieces of work are based on a common assumption that the sensor is time-triggered (or periodic-triggered), which implies that all the sensor measurement need to be transmitted to controller through communication networks at a fixed rate regardless of the state of the system to be controlled [32]. In fact, in some cases, there is no need to transmit the measurement signal to controller node for computation, see, for example, when the states of the controlled plant are close to equilibrium point, since the effect of the sensor measurement signal on system performance become small during the steady stage of state. Therefore, in the time-triggered transmission framework, some redundant measurement signal may be transmitted, which leads to inefficient utilization of the limited network resources.In order to save the network bandwidth utilization while maintaining the stability and a level of performance of the NCSs, an intuitive way is to reduce the transmission of the sensor measurement signal as much as possible. To this end, a so-called event-triggered transmission scheme, also called event-based transmission scheme has been proposed in the open literature. As an alternative to the time-triggered transmission scheme, event-triggered transmission scheme arises for its great benefits in saving communication resources [37]. In the event-triggered transmission framework, whether or not the sensor measurement signal should be transmitted is determined by the occurrence of an “event” rather than “time”. Since the pioneering work [1] on event-based control, several different ETSs have been proposed for different system models. To name a few, an absolute ETS for linear NCSs, see, for example, [21,27,28,56]; a relative ETS for linear NCSs, see, for example, [6,7,9,10,14,15,24,31,33,53]; a relative ETS for nonlinear NCSs, see, for example, [17,32,44].It is worth noting that, although the above mentioned theoretical results on event-triggered linear or nonlinear NCSs are rich, the existing results are still limited and there still exist some issues to be worthy of further investigatation due to the facts that: (i) most of the aforementioned ETSs have been performed in the continuous-time linear NCSs framewok. As is known, network-based communications are inherently of discrete nature, as packet-based protocols are commonly used to connect the components of the NCSs, not allowing for a continuous flow of information in the classic way. Despite this fact, little attention has been paid to discrete-time NCSs in the literature, especially to the discrete-time nonlinear NCSs due to the systems’ complexity. Therefore, it is preferable to design a new ETS for discrete-time nonlinear NCSs; (ii) most of the above mentioned results are based on the Lyapunov stability of the considered NCSs. Notice that stability in the sense of Lyapunov requires the ability to keep the state arbitrarily close to the system equilibrium as long as the initial state is close enough to it. This is a strong requirement for practical systems operating in the presence of unknown disturbances. As stated in [19], asymptotic stability is generally not possible but the ultimate boundness of the systems's state can be achieved in the presence of such perturbations. Unfortunately, very few results related to ultimate boundness of the systems's state in event-triggered discrete-time NCSs have been available in the literature so far. Even though the ultimately bounded stability in event-triggered feedback control system has been discussed in [22,27,28], the co-design for feedback gain matrix and ETS cannot be realized in [22], and in [27,28], only discrete-time linear NCSs rather than discrete-time nonlinear NCSs is considered. Hence, it is significant and necessity to study the event-triggered controller design for discrete-time nonlinear NCSs with taking ultimate boundness of system's trajectory into account; and (iii) a large class of nonlinear systems can be approximated by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models on any compact set to arbitrary accurary by using the fuzzy modeling approach [39], the available theory concerning the stability analysis and control synthesis of T-S fuzzy systems is fairly mature. However, in the event-triggerred framework, the problems of stability and stabilization for event-triggered networked T-S fuzzy systems have received little attention. In addition, it is worth mentioning that in some open literature, for example, due to the introduction of communication networks [16,55], or time-varying sampling [50,51], the time scales in the premise variables of T-S fuzzy models and control are essentially different, which results in the different time scales in premise variables of the global closed-loop fuzzy systems. However, this property is ignored in the proof of the main results in [16,55]. Just as pointed out in [20,26], the results in [55] and [16] are questionable (Detailed discussions can be found in [20,26]). Unfortunately, in [20,26], the authors did not provide a feasible solution for solving such a problem. In view of this, an interesting question is how to deal with this problem effectively?Motivated by the above mentioned results, in this article, we focus our attention on the state-feedback stabilization problem of discrete-time nonlinear NCSs with ETS in the presence of communication delays in T-S fuzzy model. The main contributions of this article are summarized as follows: (1) a more general mixed ETS for practical stability is proposed to reduce the network bandwidth utilization. The key idea of the proposed ETS is that if the current sensor measurement signal and the previously transmitted one satisfy a certain state-dependent relation, then an event is happening and so to trigger event generator (shown in Fig. 1) to transmit the sensor data, otherwise no event occurs. Considering the effects of communication delays and the proposed ETS, combined with T-S fuzzy model approach, an event-based discrete-time T-S fuzzy system model is established; (2) conditions for uniform utimately bounded stability are derived in the event-triggered state feedback fuzzy control framework. In particular, the obtained conditions characterize the relationship among the boundedness of the stability region, the lower and upper bounds of the communication delays, triggering parameters and feedback gains. Moreover, as a special case, a relative ETS for asymptotic stability is also proposed. Under the paradigm of the proposed ETS, criteria for designing the event-triggered fuzzy controller are established in terms of the feasibility of blinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). A co-design algorithm is developed to solve the BMIs, and the fuzzy controller and triggering parameters are obtained while guaranteeing the desired control performance and reducing the communication resource utilization simutaneously; and (3) a premise synchronizer has been delicately constructed to ensure the same premises with uniform time scales in both the T-S fuzzy models and the fuzzy rules of parallel distributed compensation (PDC) controller, which effectively overcomes the above-mentioned drawbacks. Finally, a practical example is used to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.Notation: The notation used throughout the article is standard. The superscripts “T” and “-1” stand for matrix transposition and matrix inverse, respectively,ℝndenotes the n−dimensional Euclidean space,ℤ+denotes the set of positive integers, and the notation P>0 (≥0) means that P is real symmetric and positive definite (semi-definite). The symmetric term in a symmetric matrix is denoted by *, for example,X*YZ=XYTYZ. For anyA∈ℝn×n, we defineHeA=A+AT. I is the identity matrix of appropriate dimensions and ||·|| stands for the Euclidean vector norm or the induced matrix 2-norm as appropriate. A closed ballBρx=x∣‖xk‖≤ρwhich is centered at the origin and with radius ρ is denoted byBρx.λminAandλmaxAare used to denote the minimal and maximal eigenvalue of matrix A, respectively.Consider the following nonlinear discrete-time system(1)x(k+1)=f(x(k))+g(x(k))u(k),wherex(k)∈ℝn,u(k)∈ℝmare the system state vector, control input, respectively. x(0)≜x0 is the initial state. We assume that f(x(k)) and g(x(k)) are well modeled, which implies that if the initial condition is given, the precise prediction of the state based on Eq. (1) can be derived. In this article, a framework of the considered networked control system (NCS) consisting of a discrete-time nonlinear system (1), a smart sensor, an event generator, a controller, and an actuator is schematically depicted in Fig. 1. This architecture represents a system where actuation is inexpensive, but transmission of sensor measurements to the controller is expensive. This might be the case if measurements are transmitted to the controller by sensors in a sensor network, and each sensor has a limited power budget.The type of NCS with ETS depicted in Fig. 1 is studied hereinafter, and for the convenience of narration, the following assumptions fairly standard in the NCS framework, are also made in this work:Assumption 1The state variables of the plant are available for feedback controller;Assumption 2The sensor is clock-driven, controller and actuator (consists of a zero-order holder) are event-driven;Assumption 3The communication channel is implemented only in the sensor-controller side while the controller is connected directly to the plant, and thus only the sensor-to-controller delay τkis considered, moreover, the delay τkis bounded, i.e.,τk∈τm,τM, where τmand τM0≤τm<τMare positive integers.Assumption 4The data packet is transmitted in single packet without any loss, and each data packet is time stamped.The function of the event generator is to check the event-triggering condition to determine whether an “event” is generated or not. Once an event is triggered, it implies that the generator will transmit the current sampled states to the controller. In order to quantitatively describe such scheme mathematically, let us denote the time instant when an event happens bykss=0∞withks<ks+1,ks∈ℤ+. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the first event is generated at time instant k0≜0. With the last transmitted statexksat the triggering instant ksand the current sensor measurementxkat the current sampling instant k, the next triggering instant ks+1 can be determined by(2)ks+1=infkk>ks∣xk−x(ks)TWxk−x(ks)>σxTkWxk+ɛ,whereσ∈0,1and ɛ≥0,k∈ℤ+,W>0is a weighting matrix to be designed later.Remark 1According to the ETS in (2), define two sets asΦ1≜k1,k2,⋯andΦ≜1,2,⋯. Then, it can be seen that Φ1⊆Φ. Moreover, for given parametersσ∈0,1,W>0 and ɛ≥0, there is no need to transmit the current sensor measurementxkat the sampling instant k except those instants when the event-triggering condition (2) is satisfied. In other words, from (2),∀k∈ks,ks+1−1, it yields(3)xk−x(ks)TWxk−x(ks)≤σxTkWxk+ɛ.which implies in the sensor node, only part of the sensor measurement will be transmitted to the controller for computation. Compared with the existing time-triggered (or periodic) transmission schemes used in [18,54,55], the communication bandwidth in the network is saved and the computation burden of the controller is also reduced. Particularly, in wireless sensor networks, this data transmission strategy may save the transmission energy, and thus increase the lifespan of the battery of the sensor nodes.Remark 2It is worth noting that the considered description of ETS (2) comprises several classes of ETSs investigated in the literature. For example, if σ=0 and ɛ=0, the ETS (2) is reduced to the classic periodic sampling scheme, that is, ks+1=ks+1, or equvialentlyks+1=infkk∣k>ks+1; if σ=0, W=I, and ɛ>0, the ETS (2) is reduced to the so-called absolute ETS, that is,ks+1=infkk>ks∣‖xk−x(ks)‖>ɛ, which is similar to that in [22,25,27,28]; ifσ∈0,1and ɛ=0, the ETS (2) can be simplified as the so-called relative ETS, that is,ks+1=infkk>ks∣xk−x(ks)TWxk−x(ks)>σxTkWxk, which is proposed in [6,14,32,38,53]. Furthermore, notice that the statexkin (2) denotes the current sensor measurement, if we use the last transmitted statexksinstead of the statexkin (2), then the ETS (2) can be formulated as(4)ks+1=infkk>ks∣xk−x(ks)TWxk−x(ks)>σxTksWxks+ɛ,where the parameters σ, ɛ and W are defined as in (2). Compared with (2), under the ETS (4), the event generator only needs to compute the thresholdσxTkWxkat the triggering instant ksnot at every sampling instant k. Therefore, the ETS (4) may not only save network bandwidth resources than that (2), but also reduce the computation burdon of processor in NCSs to some extent. On the other hand, it can be seen that whenσ∈0,1and ɛ=0, the ETS (4) is reduced to the so-called PETS below(5)ks+1=infkk>ks∣xk−x(ks)TWxk−x(ks)>σxTksWxks,which is discussed in [17,31,33]. Based on the above discussions, it can be seen that the proposed ETS (2) is more general than some existing ETSs.In this subsection, a networked T-S fuzzy-mode-based controller is designed via parallel distributed compensation (PDC) technique [39] to stabilize the nonlinear system (1) with ETS (2). For the analysis of convenient later, we first use T-S fuzzy model to approximate the nonlinear system (1).Based on [36], the nonlinear system (1) can be represented by some local linear dynamic systems with their linguistic description. The ith rule of the system is represented by a T-S fuzzy modelPlant rule i: IF θ1(k) isF1iand, ⋯, and θg(k) isFgi, THEN(6)x(k+1)=Aix(k)+Biu(k),wherei∈S=1,2,⋯,r, r is the number of IF-THEN rules;θj(k),j∈H=1,2,⋯,grepresent premise variables;Fjii∈S;j∈Hare fuzzy sets. Aiand Biare matrices with appropriate dimensions. Defineθ(k)=θ1(k),⋯,θg(k)T, it is assumed that θ(k) is either given or a function of x(k), and does not depend on u(t).By using a center-average defuzzifier, product inference and a singleton fuzzifier, the global dynamics of the T-S fuzzy system (6) can be inferred as(7)x(k+1)=∑i=1rμiθ(k)Aix(k)+Biu(k),where(8)μiθ(k)=ωiθ(k)∑i=1rωiθ(k),ωiθ(k)=Πj=1gFjiθj(k).andFjiθj(k)is the grade membership of θj(k) inFjii∈S;j∈H,μiθ(k)≥0,∑i=1rμiθ(k)=1. For notational simplicity, in the sequel, we use μito representμiθ(k).Under the ETS (2), the transmission times of discrete-time event generator are denoted by k1, k2, ⋯, ∞. Let rs=ks+1−ks(s=1, 2, ⋯) denote the transmission interval of the event generator with (3). The outputs of the event generator are x(ks) at the transmission instants ks. Due to the existence of the network-induced delays in sensor to controller path, these states will arrive at the controller side at the instantsk1+τk1,k2+τk2,⋯, respectively. Moreover, the avaliable premise variables for the control rules in the controller side should be θj(ks)j∈H. To apply the PDC control rules, if we use θj(ks)j∈Has the premise variables, then the time scales in premise variables of fuzzy controller will be different from that in (6), which may lead to some problem, such as different membership function expression in the derivation of the main result later. In order to avoid this problem, in the sequel, we propose a mode-based method for the re-construction of premises in the fuzzy control rule design.Notice that, under the assumptions on the system (1), the state response of system (1) can be calculated as long as the initial condition is given. Based on this fact together with x(ks) is avaliable, we can compute any x(k) fork∈ks+τks,ks+1+τks+1−1. In view of this, the premise synchronizer shown in Fig. 1 can be used to derive the premise θ(k) in the controller side. Therefore, the ith control rule can be naturally expressed asController rules i: IF θ1(k) isF1iand, ⋯, and θg(k) isFgi, THEN(9)u(k)=Kix(ks),k∈ks+τks,ks+1+τks+1−1,where θj(k) andFjij∈Hare defined as in (7). Kii∈Sare controller gains to be determined later.Applying the PDC method, the inferred fuzzy controller is given by(10)u(k)=∑i=1rμiKix(ks),k∈ks+τks,ks+1+τks+1−1.Remark 3It is important to note that the premise variables in (6) should have been different from that in (9) due to the existence of the communication network between the sensor and the controller. However, to stabilize fuzzy system (6) with the PDC method, a prepositive premise synchronizer at the controller side is constructed in Fig. 1, which is dependent on the dynamics of system in (1) and the available state information x(ks) at the controller side. With this configuration, the approximation of premise variable θ(k) fork∈ks+τks,ks+1+τks+1−1can be derived to evaluate the premise variable in system (6). Therefore, the same premise variables with the identical time scales can be used in system (6) and fuzzy controller in (9).discrete-time event generator Combining (7) and (10), fork∈ks+τks,ks+1+τks+1−1, we can obtain the following closed-loop T-S fuzzy system(11)x(k+1)=∑i=1r∑j=1rμiμjAix(k)+BiKjx(ks).In what follows, for the convenience of analysis later, we first divide the intervalΩ=ks+τks,ks+1+τks+1−1into some subintervals:(12)Ω=∪Ωn,whereΩn=ks+n+τks+n,ks+n+1+τks+n+1,n=0,1,2,⋯,ks+1−ks−1. Then, define a function dkas(13)dk=k−ks−n−τm,k∈Ωn,where dkis an artificial delay that includes the effect of both network-induced delays and ETS. Moreover, it is piecewise linear for k∈Ωn. It follows from the definition of Ωnin (12) that the numerical bounds of the artificial delay dkare given by(14)0≤τks+n−τm≤dk≤τks+n+1−τm+1≤τM−τm+1≜dM.In order to include the effect of the ETS in deriving system stability and stabilization criterion, define error vector e(k) as(15)e(k)=x(ks)−x(ks+n),k∈Ωn.From the ETS (3), (13) and (15), it can be seen that the error vector e(k) satisfies(16)eT(k)We(k)≤σxTk−dk−τmWxk−dk−τm+ɛ,k∈Ωn.Combining (15) and (16) leads to the closed-loop event-triggered fuzzy system(17)x(k+1)=∑i=1r∑j=1rμiμjAix(k)+BiKje(k)+BiKjx(k−dk−τm),k∈Ωn,subjects toeT(k)We(k)≤σxTk−dk−τmWxk−dk−τm+ɛ. For system (17), we supplement the initial condition of the state x(k) on−τm−dM,0as x(k)=ϕ(k),k∈−τm−dM,0with ϕ(0)=x0, where ϕ(k) is a continuous function on−τm−dM,0.Remark 4Note that the closed-loop event-triggered fuzzy system in (17) takes the form of a discrete-time fuzzy state-delay system with two additive delay components, one a known constant, and the other unknown but bounded. Particularly, when τm=0, e(k)=0, and ksdenotes the sampling instant, the closed-loop event-triggered fuzzy system in (17) is reduced to(18)x(k+1)=∑i,j=1rμiμjAix(k)+BiKjx(k−dk),k∈ks+τks,ks+1+τks+1−1,which has been studied in [18,40,54,55]. However, it is worth noting that the above mentioned works are based on the implicit assumption that the sensor data is periodically transmitted, Moreover, how to reduce the data transmission rate in communication network so that the network can be used for other traffic is not considered as well. As stated in Introduction, ETS may be more efficient than time-triggered one in some situations, especially in network bandwidth improvement, and thus we make an attempt to introduce the ETS in nonlinear NCSs in this article, which results in the model (17) is essentially different from that in [18,40,54,55].In this section, a sufficient condition that ensures the global uniform ultimate boundness (GUUB) of the state of the closed-loop system (17) with (2) is first derived. Then, as a special case, the problems of asymptotic stability and controller synthesis for the closed-loop system (17) with (44) are studied as well.In this subsection, on the one hand, in order to apply the standard time delay system approach, define a new function hk=dk+τm, then from (14), we have d1≜τm≤hk≤d3≜τm+dM, then the closed-loop system (17) can be equivalently reformulated as(19)x(k+1)=∑i=1r∑j=1rμiμjAix(k)+BiKjx(k−hk)+BiKje(k),subjectstoeT(k)We(k)≤σxTk−hkWxk−hk+ɛ,k∈Ωn,x(k)=ϕ(k),k∈−d3,0,whereϕ(k)k∈−d3,0denotes the initial condition. On the other hand, in order to present a sufficient condition for the GUUB of the closed-loop system (19) with interval time-vary delayhk∈d1,d3, for k∈Ωn, choose a classical Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional as(20)V(k)=xT(k)Px(k)+∑s=k−d1k−1xT(s)Q1x(s)+∑s=k−d3k−1xT(s)Q2x(s)+d3∑l=−d3+10∑s=k+l−1k−1δTsR1δs+d3−d1∑l=−d3+1−d1∑s=k+l−1k−1δTsR2δs,whereδs=xs+1−xs, and P>0, Qp>0, Rp>0p=1,2. Then, we state and establish the following stability analysis result.Theorem 1For given positive integers d1and d3satisfying 1≤d1<d3<∞, and scalarsσ∈0,1,μ∈0,1,ɛ>0, and feedback gain matrices Kjj∈S, if there exist matricesP>0,Qp>0,Rp>0p=1,2, and W>0 with appropriate dimensions such that(21)Σij+Σji<0,i,j∈S,whereΣij=Ξ***A¯ij−P**d3R1A˜ij0−R1*d3−d1R2A˜ij00−R2,withA¯ij=AiBiKj00,A˜ij=Ai−IBiKj00,Ξ=−P+Q1+Q2−R1***R1−2R1−2R2+σW**0R2−Q1−R2*0R1+R20−R1−Q2−R2.Then, the state of the closed-loop event-triggered system(19)is GUUB with an ultimate bound given by(22)‖x(k)‖≤λmaxΠλminPρ2,where Π is a positive definite matrix that can be obtained from(20)together with(39). Since the specific structure of the matrix Π is not important here, it is omitted for simplicity.

On the other hand, the following inequalities are true:(36)eT(k)We(k)≥λminW‖ek‖2,σxTk−hkWxk−hk≤σλmaxW‖xk−hk‖2≤σλmaxW‖ξk‖2.From (36) andeT(k)We(k)≤σxTk−hkWxk−hk+ɛfor k∈Ωn, we have(37)‖ek‖2≤σλmaxWλminW‖ξk‖2+ɛλminW.Substituting (37) into (35) results in(38)ΔVk≤−α1−μ‖ξk‖2+β+β+γσλmaxWλminW−αμ‖ξk‖2+ɛβ+γλminW+ɛ.Therefore, if we restrictβ+β+γσλmaxWλminW−αμ‖ξk‖2+ɛβ+γλminW+ɛ≤0, that is,‖ξk‖≥ρ1, with ρ1 defined in (22), then, it can be concluded from (38) thatΔVk≤−α1−μ‖ξk‖2≤0,∀‖ξk‖≥ρ1for k∈Ωn.Given that Lyapunov functionVkis positive and decreasing forξk∉Bρ1ξ, there exists a time instant k* whenξk*enters into the regionBρ1ξ. Fromξk*∈Bρ1ξand noting that the statexkis included in the augmented vectorξk(see, (25)),xk*∈Bρ1xis true. Moreover, sinceξk*∈Bρ1ξis true for anyhk∈d1,d3with 1≤d1<d3, a general vectorζkdefined as(39)ζTk=xTkxTk−1xTk−2⋯xTk−d3belongs to the setBρ1ζas well. Onceξk*enters into the regionBρ1ξ, the Lyapunov functionVkis not necessarily decreasing, and the augmented vector may jump outside. In this case,ξk*+1∉Bρ1ξ. According to the dynamics of the system (19), the system state can be bounded by(40)‖xk*+1‖≤∑i=1r∑j=1r‖μiμjAix(k*)+BiKjx(k*−hk*)+BiKje(k*)‖≤supi,j∈S‖Ai‖‖x(k*)‖+‖BiKj‖‖x(k*−hk*)‖+‖BiKj‖‖e(k*)‖.Applying (37) and noting thatξk*∈Bρ1ξ, we obtain(41)‖e(k*)‖≤η,where η is defined as in (22). Substituting (41) into (40) gives(42)‖xk*+1‖≤supi,j∈Sρ1‖Ai‖+‖BiKj‖+ηBiKj.Then, using (42), we havexk*+1∈Bρ2x. Based on the above discussions, it follows thatξk*+1andζk*+1may leave the regionsBρ1ξandBρ1ζ, respectively. In this case, for k≥k*+1, the Lyapunov functionVk(20) is decreasing again, which results in(43)λminP‖x(k)‖2≤xT(k)Px(k)≤Vk≤maxVk*+1=maxζTk*+1Πζk*+1≤λmaxΠ‖ζk*+1‖2≤λmaxΠρ22,which implies that‖x(k)‖≤λmaxΠλminPρ2for k≥k*+1, ρ2 is defined as in (22). This completes the proof. □Remark 5The sufficient condition (21) and the final bound onxk(22) give us intuition into the relationship among the delay bounds d1, d3, and the triggering parameters σ and ɛ to guarantee the closed-loop system (19) practical stability (i.e. the state is GUUB). For fixed d1, d3, and σ, a larger ɛ allows for larger final bound onxk, which implies that the convergence rate is faster, and vice versa. In particular, when ɛ→0, it can be seen from (22) that ρ1→0⇒η→0⇒ρ2→0, and hence, the final bound onxk(22) approaches to zero, and the global asymptotic stability can be obtained, which will be discussed in the following section. Furthermore, the sufficient condition (21) can be utilized to choose a proper σ in order to achieve a prescribed final bound onxkand a trade-off between communication resource reduction and control performance.Notice that in the derivation of Theorem 1, a sufficient condition for the GUUB of the closed-loop system (19) is obtained under an assumption that the parameter ɛ≠0. If ɛ≡0, the ETS (2) for practical stability is reduced to the following ETS for asymptotic stability(44)ks+1=infkk>ks∣xk−x(ks)TWxk−x(ks)>σxTkWxk.It is clearly that, the inequalityxk−x(ks)TWxk−x(ks)≤σxTkWxkis always satisfied for k∈Ωn. Then, the closed-loop system (19) can be rewritten as(45)x(k+1)=∑i=1r∑j=1rμiμjAix(k)+BiKjx(k−hk)+BiKje(k),subjectstoeT(k)We(k)≤σxTk−hkWxk−hk,k∈Ωn,x(k)=ϕ(k),k∈−d3,0,In what follows, we will perform the asymptotic stability analysis and controller synthesis of the closed-loop system (45). To this end, we first introduce a lemma proposed in [29], which plays an important role in deriving stability results and may reduce the conservatism of the conditions.Lemma 1For any constant matrixRl∈ℝn×n,Rl=RlT≥0,l∈ℤ+,scalar γ, a function hksatisfying1≤d1≤hk≤d3,d1∈ℤ+,d3∈ℤ+, and a vector functionx(k)∈ℝn,δ(k)=x(k+1)−x(k) such that the following sum is well defined, the following inequality is true(46)−d3−d1∑θ=k−d3k−d1−1δT(θ)Rlδ(θ)≤ξ1T(k)1+μ1Rlξ1(k)+ξ3T(k)1+μ2Rlξ3(k).Further, the sufficient conditions that guarantee the following inequality is true(47)γ+ξ1T(k)1+μ1Rlξ1(k)+ξ3T(k)1+μ2Rlξ3(k)<0are given by(48)γ+ξ1T(k)3Rlξ1(k)+ξ3T(k)Rlξ3(k)<0γ+ξ1T(k)Rlξ1(k)+ξ3T(k)3Rlξ3(k)<0,whereRl=−Rl*Rl−Rlandξ1T(k)=xT(k−d1)xT(k−hk)ξ3T(k)=xT(k−hk)xT(k−d3),μ1=−1,μ2=0,forhk=d1μ1=ɛ,μ2=1ɛ,ford1<hk<d3,ɛ=d3−hkhk−d1μ1=0,μ2=−1,forhk=d3.Proof 2Adapting the proof of [29], it is easy to complete the proof. The details are omitted here for simplicity. □Theorem 2For given positive integers d1and d3satisfying 1≤d1<d3<∞, a scalarσ∈0,1, and feedback gain matrices Kjj∈S, the closed-loop system (45) is asymptotically stable, if there exist matrices P>0, Ql>0, Rl>0l=1,2,3,W>0with appropriate dimensions such that(49)Ξiim,n=Ξ11ii+Γ11m,n*Ξ21ii−Ξ22<0,i∈S,(50)Ξijm,n=Ξ11ij+Ξ11ji+2Γ11m,n**Ξ21ij−Ξ22*Ξ21ji0−Ξ22<0,i<j,i,j∈S,m,n=1,2,whereΞ11ij=Γ11i*****R1−Q1−R1****00−Q2***KjTBiTP00σW**0000−Q3*KjTBiTP0000−W,Γ11i=HePAi−I+∑l=13Ql−R1,Ξ21ij=AijTd1AijTd2−d1AijTd3−d2AijTT,Ξ22=diagP−1,R1−1,R2−1,R3−1,Aij=Ai−I00BiKj0BiKj,Γ111,1=0*****0−3R2****00−R2−R3***03R2R2−4R2**00R30−R3*000000,Γ111,2=0*****0−R2****00−3R2−R3***0R23R2−4R2**00R30−R3*000000,Γ112,1=0*****0−R2****0R2−R2−R3***00R3−4R3**0003R3−3R3*000000,Γ112,2=0*****0−R2****0R2−R2−3R3***003R3−4R3**000R3−R3*000000.Proof 3Choose a classical Lyapunov functional candidate as(51)V(k)=V1(k)+V2(k)+V3(k),whereV1(k)=xT(k)Px(k),V2(k)=∑l=13∑s=k−dlk−1xT(s)Qlx(s),V3(k)=∑l=13∑s=−dl−dl−1−1∑θ=k+sk−1dl−dl−1δT(θ)Rlδ(θ),with d0=0 and if modd3−d1,2=0,d2=d1+d3/2, otherwised2=d1+d3+1/2.Note that(52)δ(k)=x(k+1)−x(k)=∑i=1r∑j=1rμiμjAijξ(k),whereAijis defined in (49) andξ(k)=xT(k)xT(k−d1)xT(k−d2)xT(k−hk)xT(k−d3)eT(k)T,With these notations, by using Lemma 1, the rest proof can be completed by standard arguments, the details are omitted for simplicity. □Based on Theorem 2, sufficient conditions for the existence of the feedback gains Kjj∈Sof the fuzzy event-triggered controller for the closed-loop system (45) are summarized as Theorem 3 below.Theorem 3For given positive integers d1and d3satisfying 1≤d1<d3<∞, a scalarσ∈0,1, there exists a fuzzy state-feedback controller in the form of(10)such that the closed-loop system (45) is asymptotically stable if there exist matricesX,Qˆl>0,Rˆl>0l=1,2,3,Wˆ>0and Yjwith appropriate dimensions such that(53)Ξˆiim,n=Ξˆ11ii+Γˆ11m,n*Ξˆ21ii−Ξˆ22<0,i∈S,(54)Ξˆijm,n=Ξˆ11ij+Ξˆ11ji+2Γˆ11m,n**Ξˆ21ij−Ξˆ22*Ξˆ21ji0−Ξˆ22<0,i<j,i,j∈S,m,n=1,2,whereΞˆ11ij=Γˆ11*****Rˆ1−Qˆ1−Rˆ1****00−Qˆ2***YjTBiT00σWˆ**0000−Qˆ3*YjTBiT0000−Wˆ,Γˆ11=HeAi−IX+∑l=13Qˆl−Rˆ1,Ξˆ21ij=AˆijTd1AˆijTd2−d1AˆijTd3−d2AˆijTT,Aˆij=AiX−X00BiYj0BiYj,Ξˆ22=diagX,XRˆ1−1X,XRˆ2−1X,XRˆ3−1X,andΓˆ11m,nm,n=1,2are directly obtained fromΓ11m,nby replacing the matrices R2and R3ofΓ11m,nwithRˆ2andRˆ3, respectively, other elements are zero. Moreover, if the above conditions are feasible, then the system(45)with feedback gains Kj=YjX−1j∈Sis asymptotically stable.Proof 4Defining X=P−1,Qˆl=XQlX,Rˆl=XRlXl=1,2,3,Wˆ=XWX,and Yj=KjXj∈S, then pre- and post-multiplying (49) with diagX,⋯,X︸6times,I,X,X,Xand its transpose, respectively, and pre- and post-multiplying (50) with diagX,⋯,X︸6times,I,X,X,X,I,X,X,Xand its transpose, respectively, the conditions (53) and (54) can be easily obtained, respectively. The proof is completed. □Note that the matrix inequalities (53) and (54) are not strict LMIs (i.e., non-convex) due to the existence of the nonlinear terms−XRˆl−1Xl=1,2,3. Therefore, it can not be directly solved by the well-known LMI TOOLBOX in MATLAB. In order to find a feasible solution to the above inequalities, inspired by [31], we first introduce three new matrix variables Sll=1,2,3satisfying(55)XRˆl−1X≥Sl>0,which is equivalent to(56)Rˆl−1X−1X−1Sl−1≥0.LetTl=Rˆl−1,Zl=Sl−1l=1,2,3,X=X−1, then (56) can be rewritten as(57)TlXXZl≥0.According to the above definitions, the original non-convex minimization problem can be transformed into the following nonlinear minimization problem involving LMIs conditions:(58)minTr∑l=13TlRˆl+ZlSl+XXsubjects to (53)’ and (54)’ and(59)TlXXZl≥0,TlIIRˆl≥0,ZlIISl≥0,XIIX≥0,where (53)’ and (54)’ are derived from (53) and (54) by replacingXRˆl−1Xwith Sll=1,2,3, respectively. Now, the above minimization problem (58) can be solved by the well-known cone complementarity linearization (CCL) algorithm [4]. The detailed implementation of this algorithm will be given below.Algorithm 1For given r, d1, d3 and σ, determineKj,j∈Sand W.Step 1: Set k=0. Given scalars1≤r<+∞,1≤d1<d3,σ∈0,1,j∈S,find a feasible solution satisfying LMIs in (53)’, (54)’ and (59):X0,X0,Wˆ0,Yj,0,Qˆl,0,Rˆl,0,Tl,0,Zl,0,Sl,0,l=1,2,3.If there are no solution, reset d1, d3 and σ, repeat Step 1 again.Step 2: Solve the following LMIs problem with variablesX,X,Wˆ,Yj,Qˆl,Rˆl,Tl,Zl,Sll=1,2,3:minTr∑l=13Tl,kRˆl+Rˆl,kTl+Zl,kSl+Sl,kZl+XkX+XkXsubjectsto(53)′,(54)′,and(59).SetXk+1=X,Xk+1=X,Wˆk+1=Wˆ,Yj,k+1=Yj,Qˆl,k+1=Qˆl,Rˆl,k+1=Rˆl,Tl,k+1=Tl,Rˆl,k+1=Rˆl,Zl,k=Zl,Sl,k+1=Sl,l=1,2,3.Step 3: If the conditions (53) and (54) are satisfied, then output the feedback gain matrix Kj=YjX−1 and exit. Otherwise, set k=k+1, and return to Step 2.Remark 6Note that there is another way to deal with the nonlinear termsXRˆl−1Xin (53) and (54). In fact, the inequalities−XRˆl−1X≤λl2Rˆl−2λlXare true for any λl>0l=1,2,3. Then, substituting the termsXRˆl−1Xin (53) and (54) byλl2Rˆl−2λlXl=1,2,3, respectively, the nonlinear matrix inequalities (53) and (54) can be replaced by the corresponding strict LMIs, which can be easily solved by LMI TOOLBOX in MATLAB. However, it is worth mentioning that three parametersλll=1,2,3need to be determined before solving the related LMIs. How to choose suitable parameter values is a challenging problem. In order to avoid this problem, the CCL algorithm is utilized here, although the iteration process of implementing this algorithm may be more time consuming, eventually yielding less conservative results in general.Remark 7Note that the main results obtained in this article are based on the quadratic Lyapunov function approach, which has been widely used in the open literature, see, for example, [5,2,3,59]. Generally speaking, basis-dependent Lyapunov function approach can also be used to deal with the problem considered in this article. It can be seen from [5] that although the design procedures by using basis-dependent Lyapunov function become more complex, and the computational requirement is usually demanding, the obtained results are less conservative than with the use of quadratic Lyapunov function. However, the goal of this article is not the reduction of the conservatism by using novel functionals, but to propose a general method to design event-triggered fuzzy controller for a class of nonlinear discrete-time NCSs with communication delays. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the controller gain K must be given in advance in some existing results (see, e.g., [38,44]), while this condition is no longer needed in this article.In this section, we will use the inverted pendulum borrowed from [43] to show the improvement of our results over some existing ones in the first example. Then, we will use a nonlinear mass-spring-damper mechanical system borrowed from [40] and [34] to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed controller design method in the second example.Example 1Consider system (7) with r=1, and the associated system parameters are given byA1=010000−mgM0000100g/l0,B1=01/M0−1/Ml,where M=10 is the cart mass and m=1 is the mass of the pendulum bob, l=3 is the length of the pendulum arm and g=10 is gravitational acceleration. The statext=x1x2x3x4T=yy˙θθ˙T, where xi(i=1, 2, 3, 4) are the cart's position, the cart's velocity, the pendulum bob's angle and the pendulum bob's angular velocity, respectively. In the sequel, for fair comparison, take the same sampling period h=0.12s with zero communication delay, the same state feedback gain matrixK=212378210, and the same initial statex0=0.9800.20Tas in [28] and [24]. Under the above parameters, the comparison results on the average transmission periods (ATPs) generated by our method and the latest results obtained in [28] and [24] are listed in Table 1.It can be seen from Table 1 that the method proposed in this article can provide a larger ATP than that given in [28] and [24].Example 2Consider a nonlinear mass-spring-damper mechanical system, whose dynamic equation is given by(60)My¨(t)+gy(t),y˙(t)+fy(t)=ϕy˙(t)u(t),where M and u(t) denote the mass and the force, respectively.fy(t),gy(t),y˙(t), andϕy˙(t)are the nonlinear or uncertain terms with respect to the spring, the damper, and the input, respectively. Assume thatgy(t),y˙(t)=c1y(t)+c2y˙(t),fy(t)=cty(t), andϕy˙(t)=1+c5y˙3(t), wherectis the uncertain term within the sectorc3,c4and M=1.0, c1=0, c2=1, c3=0.5, c4=1.81, and c5=0.13. Choose the state variablex(t)=x1tx2tT=y˙(t)y(t)T, the uncertain nonlinear system (60) can be represented by the fuzzy modelx˙(t)=Aμx(t)+Bμu(t), whereAμ=∑i=12μiAiandBμ=∑i=12μiBiwithA1=−1−1.15510,B1=1.43870,A2=−1−1.15510,B2=0.56130,For simulation, choose a sampling period h=0.2, then the corresponding system parameters of discrete-time model (7) are given by(61)A1=0.7986−0.20780.17990.9784,B1=0.31190.0023,A2=0.7986−0.20780.17990.9784,B2=0.12170.0023,The membership functions are chose as μ1(x1(k))=sin2(x1(k)), μ2(x1(k))=1−μ1(x1(k)). The purpose of this example is to design the fuzzy controller (10) with r=2 such that the closed-loop event-triggered fuzzy system (45) is asymptotically stable.For this example, we first show that using Theorem 3 together with the algorithm 1 results in larger values of d3 than that by Theorem 3 with the basic inequalities stated in Remark 6. For instance, setting d1=1 and σ=0.5, using Theorem 3 with algorithm 1, the maximum d3 is obtained as 11 with 7 iterations, which is larger than 7 obtained by Theorem 3 with the basic inequalities stated in Remark 6 (choosing λ1=λ2=λ3=35 for simplicity). It should be pointed out that the values of the parameters λll=1,2,3affect the the maximum value of d3, this point can be seen in Table 2(the corresponding parameters K1, K2, W are also given here), from which we know that it is difficult to choose a group of optimal value to make the value of d3 as large as possible. Moreover, by further simulation tests, it is found that the maximum of d3 and the maximum of σ may not exist simultaneously, so the tradeoff between them needs to be considered in the process of system analysis and design.Next, we will show the advantage of the utilization of the event-triggering scheme. To this end, we consider the following two cases:Case A: When σ=0, that is, the ETS (44) shrinks to periodic transmission scheme. Setting d1=1 and d3=10, applying Theorem 3 with algorithm 1, the feedback gains K1, K2, and weighting matrix W are given by(62)K1=−0.0354−0.0086,K2=−0.0794−0.0043,W=103×4.39973.02213.02216.1177,Under the above parameters, choose the initial conditionsx(0)=1−1T, the state responses of the closed-loop fuzzy system (7) with (60) and (62) are plotted in Fig. 2, from which one can see that the closed-loop fuzzy system is asymptotically stable.Case B: Whenσ∈0,1. Setting σ=0.3, d1=1, and d3=7, applying Theorem 3 algorithm 1, the feedback gains K1, K2, and weighting matrix W are given by(63)K1=−0.0502−0.0040,K2=−0.1279−0.0026,W=103×4.21420.76500.76500.9840,Thus, for this example, under the condition that σ=0.3 and the obtained weighting matrix W in (63), the current sensor measurement x(k) is transmitted whenever the x(k) and the previously transmitted one x(ks) satisfy(64)x1(k)−x1(ks)x2(k)−x2(ks)T4.21420.76500.76500.9840x1(k)−x1(ks)x2(k)−x2(ks)>0.3×x1(k)x2(k)T4.21420.76500.76500.9840x1(k)x2(k),In order to make fair comparisons, choose the same initial conditions as in Case A, then under the ETS (64), the system state should be transmitted at a rate of approximately 2.6 samples per second. Fig. 3shows the state responses of the closed-loop system (7) with (60) under the ETS (64). Fig. 4shows the release instants and release intervals. From these figures, it can be seen that the proposed event-triggered approach can reduce the average transmission frequency while guaranteeing a certain level of control performance.
