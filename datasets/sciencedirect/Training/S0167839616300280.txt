@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The theory of the isoptic curves is widely studied in the Euclidean planeE2(see Cieślak et al., 1991 and Wieleitner, 1908 and the references given there). The analogous question was investigated by the authors in the hyperbolicH2and ellipticE2planes (see Csima and Szirmai, 2010, 2012, submitted for publication), but in the higher dimensional spaces there are only few results in this topic.In Csima and Szirmai (2013) we gave a natural extension of the notion of the isoptic curves to the n-dimensional Euclidean spaceEn(n≥3)which is called isoptic hypersurface. Now we develope an algorithm to determine the isoptic surfaceHPof a 3-dimensional polyhedronP.We will determine the isoptic surfaces for Platonic solids and for some semi-regular Archimedean polytopes and visualize them with Wolfram Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Inc., 2015).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Let G be one of the constant curvature plane geometries, either the EuclideanE2or the hyperbolicH2or the ellipticE2. The isoptic curve of a given plane curveCis the locus of pointsP∈GwhereCis seen under a given fixed angle α(0<α<π). An isoptic curve formed by the locus of tangents meeting at right angles is called orthoptic curve. The name isoptic curve was suggested by Taylor (1884).In Cieślak et al. (1991, 1996) the isoptic curves of the closed, strictly convex curves are studied, by use of their support function. The explicit formula for the isoptic curve of the triangle can be found in Michalska and Mozgawa (2015). The papers Wunderlich (1971a, 1971b) deal with curves having a circle or an ellipse by an isoptic curve. Further curves appearing as isoptic curves are well studied in the Euclidean plane geometryE2, see e.g.Loria (1911), Wieleitner (1908). Isoptic curves of conic sections have been studied in Holzmüller (1882) and Siebeck (1860). Isoptic curves of Bézier curves are considered in Kunkli et al. (2013). A lot of papers concentrate on the properties of the isoptics e.g.Miernowski and Mozgawa (1997), Michalska (2003), and the references given there. The papers Kurusa (2012) and Kurusa and Ódor (2015) deal with inverse problems.In the hyperbolic and elliptic planesH2andE2the isoptic curves of segments and proper conic sections are determined by the authors Csima and Szirmai (2010, 2012, 2014). In Csima and Szirmai (submitted for publication) we extended the notion of the isoptic curves to the outer (non-proper) points of the hyperbolic plane and determined the isoptic curves of the generalized conic sections.It is known, that the angle between two half-lines with the vertex A in the plane can be measured by the arc length on the unit circle around the point A. This statement can be generalized to the higher dimensional Euclidean spaces. The notion of the solid angle is well known and widely studied in the literature (see Gardner and Verghese, 1971). We recall this definition concerning the 3-dimensional Euclidean spaceE3.Definition 1.1The solid angleΩS(p)subtended by a surface S is defined as the surface area of the projection of S onto the unit sphere aroundP(p), where p is the coordinates of P.The isoptic hypersurface in the n-dimensional Euclidean space(n≥3)is defined in Csima and Szirmai (2013) and now, we recall some statements and specify them toE3.Definition 1.2The isoptic hypersurfaceHDαinE3of an arbitrary 3-dimensional compact domainDis the locus of points P where the measure of the projection ofDonto the unit sphere around P is equal to a given fixed value α, where0<α<2π(see Fig. 1).In this paper we develope an algorithm and the corresponding computer program to determine the isoptic surface of an arbitrary convex polyhedron in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. We apply this algorithm for the regular Platonic solids and some semi-regular Archimedean solids as well. We note here that this generalization of the isoptic curves to the 3-dimensional space provides possible research to extend the notion of isoptic surfaces to bounded polyhedral surfaces and, with triangulations, to ‘smooth surfaces’.In this section we discuss the algorithm developed to determine the isoptic surface of a given polyhedron.1.We assume that an arbitrary polyhedronPis given by the usual data structure. This consists of the list of facetsFPwith the set of verticesViin clockwise order. Each facet can be embedded into a plane.It is well known, that ifa∈R3∖{0}andb∈Rthen{x∈R3|aTx=b}is a plane and{x∈R3|aTx≤b}defines a halfspace. Every polyhedron is the intersection of finitely many halfspaces. Therefore an arbitrary polyhedron can also be given by a system of inequalitiesAx≤bwhereA∈Rm×3(4≤m∈N),x∈R3andb∈Rm.For an arbitrary pointP(p)∈E3we have to decide, that which facets ofP‘can be seen’ from it. Let us denote the ith facet ofPbyFPi(i=1,…,m)and byaithe vector derived by the ith row of the matrix A which characterize the facetFPi.Since the polyhedronPis given by the system of inequalitiesAx≤b, where each inequalityaix≤bi(i∈{1,2…,m}) is assigned to a certain facet, therefore the facetFPiis visible from P if an only if the inequalityaip>biholds.Now, we define the characteristic functionIPi(x)for each facetFPi:IPi(x)={1aix>bi0aix≤bi.Using the Definition 1.1, letΩi(p):=ΩFPi(p)be the solid angle of the facetFPiregarding the pointP(p).To determineΩi(p), we use the methods of the spherical geometry. Let us suppose thatFPicontainsnivertices,Vij(xij)(j=1,…,ni) where the vertices are given in clockwise order. Projecting these vertices onto the unit sphere centered inP(p)we get a sphericalni-gon (see Fig. 2), whose area can be calculated by the usual formulaΩi(p)=Θ−(ni−2)π.Here Θ is the sum of the anglesτjof the spherical projection of the polygonFPiwhere the angles are measured in radians.To obtain anglesτj, we need to determine the angles between the two planes containing the neigbouring edgesPV‾ij−1,PV‾ijandPV‾ij,PV‾ij+1. Thus forj=1,2,…,n(i0:=iniandini+1:=i1), we have:τj=π−arccos⁡(〈PV→ij−1×PV→ij,PV→ij×PV→ij+1〉|PV→ij−1×PV→ij||PV→ij×PV→ij+1|).Finally, we get the solid angle functionΩi(x)of the facetFPifor anyx∈R3:Ωi(x)=2π−∑j=1niarccos⁡(〈XV→ij−1×XV→ij,XV→ij×XV→ij+1〉|XV→ij−1×XV→ij||XV→ij×XV→ij+1|).We can summarize our results in the followingTheorem 2.1Let us consider a solid angle α (0<α<2π) and a convex polyhedronPgiven by its data structure and its set of inequality. Then the isoptic surface ofPcan be determined by the equationα=∑i=1mIPi(x)Ωi(x).1.The algorithm can be easily extended for non-closed directed surfaces e.g. for subdivision surfaces.If we have a convex polyhedron, then projecting its whole surface to the unit sphere, we obtain a double coverage (double solid angle) of the given polyhedron, therefore the algorithm can be changed i.e. it is not necessary to determine the visible facets. In this case the isoptic surfaces are determined by the following implicit equation:α=12∑i=1mΩi(x).Following the steps of the above described algorithm, we will calculate the compound isoptic surface of a given regular tetrahedronTwhose data structure is determined by its vertices and facets where the facetsFPiare given by their clockwise ordered vertices:A1=(0,0,23−126),A2=(−123,−12,−126),A3=(−123,12,−126),A4=(13,0,−126),{FT1,{A2,A3,A4}},{FT2,{A3,A2,A1}},{FT3,{A4,A1,A2}},{FT4,{A1,A4,A3}}.This tetrahedron can also be given by its system of inequalities:(00−43−8604346−123434612343)(xyz)≤(2323232).Since the final formula of the isoptic surface is too long to appear in print even for this simple example (the right side of the equation consists of twelve arccos function), we choosei=1and derive onlyIP1(x).IP1(x,y,z)={1−43z>20−43z≤2.For the obtained surface, see Fig. 3(left), and Fig. 3 (right) shows a part of the tetrahedral isoptic surface for the solid angleα=π/8. The surfaceϕ1,2is derived by the solid angles of the facetsFT3andFT4. The isoptic surfaceϕ1is derived by the solid angles of the facetsFT2,FT3andFT4and the isoptic surfaceϕ2is derived by the solid angles of the facetsFT1,FT3andFT4.In the following we apply our algorithm to some polyhedra. We note here that the algorithm provides the implicit equation of the compound isoptic surface related to the given polyhedron (see Figs. 4 and 5).Remark 2.3Despite the equation can be obtained inO(e)steps, where e is the number of edges, the rendering of these figures by Wolfram Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Inc., 2015) takes 20–40 minutes. The implicit equation of the isoptic surface is so complicated that it seems difficult to draw further consequences from it.
