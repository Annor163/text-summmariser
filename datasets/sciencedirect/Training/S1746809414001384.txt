@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Local binary pattern (LBP) is a texture descriptor that has been proven to be quite effective for various image analysis tasks in image processing. In this paper one-dimensional local binary pattern (1D-LBP) based features are used for classification of seizure and seizure-free electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The proposed method employs a bank of Gabor filters for processing the EEG signals. The processed EEG signal is divided into smaller segments and histograms of 1D-LBPs of these segments are computed. Nearest neighbor classifier utilizes the histogram matching scores to determine whether the acquired EEG signal belongs to seizure or seizure-free category. Experimental results on publicly available database suggest that the proposed features effectively characterize local variations and are useful for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals with a classification accuracy of 98.33%. This result demonstrates the superiority of our approach for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals over recently proposed approaches in the literature.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder which affects around 1% of the world's population [1]. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is commonly used by experts in diagnosis of neurological disorders including epileptic seizures, which are characterized by frequently occurring of spikes in EEG signal [2]. The automatic seizure detection based on EEG signal processing is very useful for diagnosis of epilepsy [3].Automated classification of epileptic seizures from EEG signals has been extensively studied in the literature and several methodologies have been developed. Research work in this area can be broadly classified into four categories namely time-domain, frequency-domain, time–frequency domain and nonlinear methods of analysis, based on the signal processing methods employed for extraction of discriminatory features [4].Many time-domain based methods have been proposed for epileptic seizure detection from EEG signals in the literature. The linear prediction error energy computed from the EEG signals has been used as a feature for detection of epileptic seizures [5]. The energy and prediction energy derived from the fractional linear prediction (FLP) has been proposed as a features set for support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals [6]. The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and cosine radial basis function neural network has been suggested for detection of epileptic seizures from EEG signals [7]. The artificial neural network (ANN) based method proposed in [8] utilizes time-domain features for discriminating seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. Frequency-domain based features obtained using Fourier transformation of EEG signals has been proposed in [9] for epileptic seizure detection.The time-frequency domain based method for epileptic seizure detection includes time-frequency distribution [10], wavelet transform [11–16], multi-wavelet transform [17], and empirical mode decomposition based techniques [18–21]. Mean frequency computed using Fourier-Bessel expansion of the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) extracted from empirical mode decomposition process has been used to discriminate between ictal and seizure-free EEG signals [18]. The weighted frequency of IMFs has been proposed to detect epileptic seizures from EEG signals [19]. The use of 95% confidence ellipse area of second-order difference plot of IMFs of EEG signals has been proposed for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals [20]. The coefficient of variation and fluctuation index computed from the IMFs of EEG signals have been proposed for recognition of epileptic seizures [21].The non-linear parameters also computed from EEG signals for classification of epileptic seizure EEG signals. The Lyapunov exponent feature computed from EEG signals together with probabilistic neural network (PNN) has been proposed for classification of epileptic seizures [22]. The correlation integral has been developed as a feature for detecting temporal lobe epilepsy [23]. The fractional dimension parameter which measures complexity of EEG signals, have been used for discrimination of epileptic seizure EEG signals [24]. The approximate entropy (ApEn) of EEG signals with ANN has been proposed for detection of epileptic seizures [25].Local binary pattern is a texture descriptor that has proven to be quite effective for various image analysis tasks including texture classification, face recognition, image retrieval applications [26–28]. It is widely used as it effectively captures intensity variations in local neighborhood of a pixel and provides a simple representation. The nature of generation of LBP features suits very well for analysis of non-stationary signals such as EEG. Despite these evident advantages, there is very little work in the biomedical signal processing literature that investigates the effectiveness of LBP features. This has motivated us to explore the utility of one dimensional formulation of local binary patterns (ID–LBP) for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. Major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: Firstly, we propose a new approach for classification of EEG signals based on Gabor filtering and local binary patterns and demonstrate that proposed features carry significant discriminating information for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. In addition, this paper also investigates three different schemes for fusion of information in the proposed framework in order to further improve the classification accuracy.In this paper, we propose a new method based on the one-dimensional local binary pattern (1D-LBP) features for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the proposed method. This section includes description of Gabor filter, histogram features of local binary patterns, information fusion schemes and classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. Section 3 provides description of dataset and presents experimental results and discussion. Finally, concluding remarks are provided in Section 4.
