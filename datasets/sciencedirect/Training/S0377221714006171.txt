@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The eigenvector method (EM) is well-known to derive information from pairwise comparison matrices in decision making processes. However, this method is logically incomplete since its actual numerical error is unknown and its reliability is doubted by such phenomena as “right–left asymmetry”, “rank reversal”, and reversal of “order of intensity of preference”.In this paper, we associate EM with some standard measuring procedure, analyze this procedure from the viewpoint of measurement theory, and find the actual EM error. We show that the above phenomena have the same cause and are eliminated when the EM errors are taken into account.The full decision support tool, which has all components of a standard measuring tool, is composed of pairwise comparisons as an initial measuring procedure, EM as a data processor, and the obtained formulas for EM errors as an error indicator. We consider two versions of this tool based on the right and the left principal eigenvectors of a pairwise comparison matrix. Both versions are equally suitable to measure and rank any comparable elements with positive numerical values, and have the same mean relative errors equal to the square root of the double Saaty’s Consistency Index.Using the mean relative error, we find the simple upper estimate for maximum permissible errors not impeding the reliable ranking. This estimate imposes tight restrictions on inconsistency of expert judgements in decision making processes with a large number of alternatives. These restrictions are much stronger than previously thought.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Pairwise comparison matrices are handy to represent the preferences of experts in decision making processes. Different methods are applied to derive finished information from these matrices (e.g., see Barzilai, 1997; Choo & Wedley, 2004; Cook & Kress, 1988; Hovanov, Kolari, & Sokolov, 2008; Jones & Mardle, 2004; Kou & Lin, 2014; Saaty, 1977). One of them is the eigenvector method (EM) proposed by Saaty (1977) for the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). EM derives values (priorities) ω1, …, ωnof comparable elements Ω1, …, Ωnas the solution of the right eigenvector problemAω1⋯ωn=λmaxω1⋯ωnfor the corresponding pairwise comparison matrix A with the largest real eigenvalue λmax. This elegant method is widely applied to analysis of different practical problems (see Vaidya & Agarwal, 2006; Ishizaka & Labib, 2011). However, EM has significant drawbacks.Firstly, the actual numerical error of the derived values ω1, …, ωnis unknown. The values are exact only when the pairwise comparison matrix A=∥aik∥ is perfectly consistent, i.e., the transitivity rule aikakr=airholds for all comparisons (Saaty, 1977). Any inconsistency entails errors. EM uses the Consistency Ratio (CR) (Saaty, 1980) and Saaty’s criterion of CR⩽0.1 to accept or reject an inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix. The eligibility of this criterion has been much debated (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008; Bózoki & Rapcsák, 2008; Kwiesielewicz & van Uden, 2004; Karapetrovic & Rosenbloom, 1999; Monsuur, 1997). Regardless of the opinions, the Consistency Ratio is only a heuristic criterion, which does not purpose to detect actual numerical errors of the derived values ω1, …, ωn.Secondly, only two years later after the publication of the original EM, Johnson, Beine, and Wang (1979) show a rank reversal problem for scale inversion with EM: the right eigenvector ranking of elements Ω1, …, Ωnis not necessarily the same as the left one. The ranking depends on the formulation of the problem. This fundamental problem of EM has been discussed in the literature, from several perspectives (e.g., see Saaty, 1980; Saaty & Vargas, 1984; Dodd, Donegan, & McMaster, 1995; Barzilai, 1997; Bózoki & Rapcsák, 2008; Deturck, 1987).Thirdly, one of the more controversial aspects of EM and AHP is the rank reversal phenomenon caused by the addition or deletion of an element under consideration. In relation to AHP as a whole, this phenomenon has been considered by numerous authors (e.g., see Belton & Grear, 1985; Saaty, 1987; Dyer, 1990; Barzilai, 1997; Maleki & Zahir, 2013). The examples of rank reversal in EM were observed by Hochbaum and Levin (2006) and Raharjo and Endah (2005).Fourthly, Bana e Costa and Vansnick (2008) show the undesirable ability of EM to reverse expert’s “order of intensity of preferences”. According to their opinion, it is “a serious fundamental weakness that makes the use of AHP as a decision support tool very problematic”. Although Wang, Chin, and Luo (2009) express an opposite opinion, the problem remains.In this paper, we use a correspondence between EM and some “matrix” measuring procedure, analyze this procedure from the viewpoint of measurement theory, and find actual numerical errors Δω1, …, Δωnof the EM values ω1, …, ωn. We show that “right–left asymmetry”, “rank reversal”, and reversal of “order of intensity of preference” have the same cause: the invalid use of only the values ω1, …, ωnfor a ranking. We demonstrate that these phenomena are self-eliminated when the errors Δω1, …, Δωnare taken into account, and show that EM can be considered as a full decision support tool.Let Ω1, Ω2, …, Ωnbe comparable elements with positive numerical values. Suppose we have a measuring procedure(1)Ω1⋯Ωn→measuringprocedure→ω1(1),…,ω1(n)⋯ωn(1),…,ωn(n),which realizes some matrix measurement from n independent measurements of each elements. Then, according to the measurement theory (e.g., see Taylor, 1997), we can use the arithmetic mean(2)ωi=1n∑k=1nωi(k)as an approximate value of Ωi, the standard deviation(3)Δωi=1n-1∑k=1nωi(k)-ωi2as its error, and ωi±Δωias its actual value. These procedures compose some measuring tool(4)Ω1⋯Ωn→measuringprocedure→ω1(1),…,ω1(n)⋯ωn(1),…,ωn(n)→→dataprocessor(2)errorindicator(3)→ω1±Δω1⋯ωn±Δωn.By using EM, this statistical measuring tool can be adapted to the measuring procedure in the form of pairwise comparisons.1For pairwise comparisons of the human responses to physical stimuli, a statistical approach to calculate priorities was used by psychologists back in the 1920-ies (e.g., Thurstone, 1927; Yokoyama, 1921).1This possibility ensues from the following.PropositionFor any positive valuesωi(k)i,k=1nwith means ω1, …, ωndefined by(2)and any λmax>0 there exists a unique n×n positive matrix A=∥aik∥ with the largest real eigenvalue λmaxsuch that(5)∑k=1naikωk=λmaxωi,i=1,…,n,and(6)ωi(k)=nλmaxaikωk,i,k=1,…,nConversely, for any n×n positive matrix A=∥aik∥ with the largest real eigenvalue λmaxthere exist unique positive valuesωi(k)i,k=1nwith means ω1, …, ωnsuch that(5) and (6)hold (see the proof inAppendix A).According to this proposition, each positive matrix corresponds to some measuring tool (4) and each measuring tool (4) corresponds to some positive matrix A=∥aik∥ such that(1)the means ω1, …, ωn(2) of Ω1, …, Ωnform the eigenvector of A with the largest real eigenvalue λmax (see (5)), i.e.,(7)Aω1⋯ωn=λmaxω1⋯ωn;due to (6), the errors (3) and the relative errors of these means are equal to(8)Δωi=1n-1∑k=1nnλmaxaikωk-ωi2,i=1,…,n,(9)Δωiωi=1n-1∑k=1nnλmaxaikωkωi-12,i=1,…,n;if a measuring procedure (1) is absolutely precise (i.e.,ω1(k)=ω1,…,ωn(k)=ωnfor all k), then (see (6))(10)aik∼ωiωk,i,k=1,…,n,i.e., A is similar to a pairwise comparison matrix.The above means that any practicable comparison procedure (algorithm) for comparable elements Ω1, Ω2, …, Ωn, which generates a positive matrix A=∥aik∥ with functionally independent entries and makes possible the precise limit (10), with (7) and (8), composes the following “matrix measuring tool”(11)Ω1⋯Ωn→comparisonprocedure→a11⋯a1n⋯an1⋯ann→→dataprocessor(7)errorindicator(8)→ω1±Δω1⋯ωn±Δωn.This tool has all properties of a standard measuring tool: it generates quantitative estimations ω1, …, ωnand indicates their errors Δω1, …, ΔωnSaaty’s EM uses the algorithm (7) and the pairwise comparison procedure(12)aik=approximatevalueofΩiapproximatevalueofΩk,i,k=1,…,n,which automatically satisfies the precise limit (10): if the procedure (12) is absolutely precise then the approximate value of Ωitends to the exact value (=ωi) andaik=exactvalueofΩiexactvalueofΩk=ωiωk,i,k=1,…,n.It means that Saaty’s EM is one of the possible versions of the matrix measuring tool (11). The formulas (8) and (9) indicate errors in the case of inconsistent pairwise comparison matrices.In addition, it is usually assumed in AHP that a pairwise comparison matrix is reciprocally symmetric, i.e.,(13)aik=1aki,i,k=1,…,n.For this case, there exists a simple approximation for the mean relative error(14)Δωiωimean≡1n∑j=1nΔωjωj2.It is (see Appendix B)(15)Δωiωimean≈2n-1(λmax-n).This approximation is in good agreement with (9) and (14) for all 0−0.9 relative errors and proportional to the square root of Saaty’s Consistency Index(16)CIn=(λmax-n)/(n-1).For any 3×3 reciprocally symmetric comparison matrix,Δω1ω1=Δω2ω2=Δω3ω3=ΔωiωimeanandΔωj=ωjΔωiωimean≈ωjλmax-n,j=1,2,3.For n>3, it is possible to considerΔωj≈ωjΔωiωimean,j=1,…,n,as crude errors and use (15) to express-check the calculation accuracy.In decision making processes, the values ω1±Δω1, …, ωn±Δωnare used for ranking of the elements Ω1, …, Ωn. The reliable ranking of all elements is possible when the intervals [ω1−Δω1, ω1+Δ ω1], …, [ωn−Δωn, ωn+Δωn] are disjoint, i.e., Δωi+Δωk<∣ωi−ωk∣ for all i≠k:This imposes restrictions on maximum permissible errors. It is easy to get the following simple approximate upper estimate of permissible errors:(17)Δωiωimean<1n-1=50%,n=333%,n=425%,n=517%,n=7⇒(15)λmax-n<12(n-1)(this result is correct when the 9-point Saaty ratio scale is used for the pairwise comparisons). The fulfillment of (17) does not guarantee the reliable ranking. But if (17) does not hold then the reliable ranking of all elements is problematic or impossible and a revision of the pairwise comparisons is advisable. The inequality (17) imposes tight restrictions on inconsistency of expert judgements in decision making processes with a large number of alternatives. These restrictions are much stronger than previously thought (see Section 5.1).According to Proposition, pairwise comparisons of elements Ω1, …, Ωnare equivalent to the multiply measuring procedure (1). If pairwise comparisons (=entries of a pairwise comparison matrix) are independent then all measurements are statistically independent. The use of reciprocally symmetric pairwise comparison matrices (13) decreases the actual number of statistically independent measurements and the accuracy of data on Ω1, …, Ωn(especially for small n). For example, in the case n=2 any reciprocally symmetric pairwise comparison matrix is automatically consistent as if any pairwise comparison of two elements is logically absolutely precise. The last is not correct in general. Therefore, it is more desirable not to use reciprocally symmetric matrices and to get aikand akifor i≠k as the results of independent comparisons.EM with a pairwise comparison matrix A=∥aik∥ (12) is one of versions of the matrix measuring tool (11). Another version is EM with the transposed matrixAT=||ãik||,(18)ãik=aki=1/approximatevalueofΩi1/approximatevalueofΩk,which has the same largest real eigenvalue λmax and satisfies the precise limit (10) for the inverse valuesω̃1,…,ω̃n(ω̃i≈1/approximatevalueofΩi)of the elements Ω1, …, Ωn(see the comment to (12)). According to Section 2. a data processor of this version is the right eigenvector problemATω̃1⋯ω̃n=λmaxω̃1⋯ω̃nfor the matrix ATthat is equal to the left eigenvector problemω̃1⋯ω̃nA=λmaxω̃1⋯ω̃nfor the matrix A. Substitutingãik,ω̃k,Δω̃kfor aik, ωk, Δωkin (8), (9), (14) and (15), we get formulas for the errorsΔω̃1,…,Δω̃n. In the case of absolutely precise measurements, the matrix measuring tools with matrices (18) and (12) generate mutually inverse values of the compared elements Ω1, …, Ωn: if one tool generates the valuesω̃1,…,ω̃nthen another tool generates the values ω1, …, ωn, such thatωk=1/ω̃kfor all k.In the case of an inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix A, the inverse valuesω̃k±Δω̃k, k=1, …, n, obtained by the left eigenvector method are transformed to the normal valueswk±Δwk=1ω̃k∓Δω̃k=1ω̃k∓Δω̃k·ω̃k±Δω̃kω̃k±Δω̃k==ω̃kω̃k2-Δω̃k2±Δω̃kω̃k2-Δω̃k2with(19)wk=ω̃kω̃k2-Δω̃k2=1ω̃k·1-Δω̃k2/ω̃k2-1.For all permissible errors, the values wk±Δwkare in close agreement with the values ωk±Δωkobtained by the right eigenvector method. Both versions of the matrix measuring tool are equally suitable to measure and rank any comparable elements Ω1, …, Ωnwith positive numerical values.Note that the ranking, which uses only the mean values ω1, …, ωnandω̃1,…,ω̃nwithout taking account their errors, leads to the so called “rank reversal problem for scale inversion”. This and other similar problematic questions are discussed in the next section.Different phenomena, which suggest that the EM ranking is not reliable, have been discussed in the literature (see Introduction). These phenomena are connected with three concomitant facts. Firstly, the pairwise comparisons of elements under consideration are not consistent. Secondly, the Saaty criterion of CR⩽0.1 (Saaty, 1980) is used to accept or reject an inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix. Thirdly, only the ranking of the mean values ω1, …, ωn(=principle eigenvector entries) is used for the ranking of elements Ω1, …, Ωn.The last statement is especially important because the inequality ωi>ωk(or ωi<ωk) implies the reliable ranking Ωi≻Ωk(or Ωi≺Ωk) of the elements Ωiand Ωkonly if the errors Δωiand Δωkare sufficiently small, and the intervals [ωi−Δωi, ωi+Δωi] and [ωk−Δωk, ωk+Δωk] are disjoint, i.e.,(20)Δωi+Δωk<|ωi-ωk|.If this condition is strongly violated, for example, Δωi+Δωk=3∣ωi−ωk∣:or(21)Δωi+Δωk>3|ωi-ωk|then obviously the inequality ωi>ωk(or ωi<ωk) does not contain any reliable information on the ranking of the elements Ωiand Ωk, and the ranking outside the probability theory is not possible.We show below that the Saaty criterion enables to accept inconsistent pairwise comparison matrices corresponding to strong violations of the inequality (20). Also we show that the problem phenomena correspond to the case (21). It means that these phenomena (based only on the ranking of the mean values ω1, …, ωn) are not valid.Saaty (1980) defined the Consistency Ratio as CR=CIn/RIn, where CInis the Consistency Index (16) and RInis the average random Consistency Index derived from a sample of size 500 of randomly generated n×n reciprocal matrices:RI3=0.58,RI4=0.9,RI5=1.12,RI6=1.24,RI7=1.32.Saaty claimed that if CR⩽0.1 then the pairwise comparison matrix is acceptable (i.e., the EM error is admissible). We can test the CR criterion. Taking into account (15) and (16), we getΔωiωimean≈2CIn=CR2RIn=CR1.08,n=31.34,n=41.50,n=51.62,n=7.For CR=0.1 we obtainΔωiωimean≈34%n=342%,n=447%,n=551%,n=7.According to (17), the threshold CR=0.1 corresponds to adverse errors for all n>3. More recently, Saaty’s threshold is 0.05 for 3×3 and 0.08 for 4×4 matrices (Saaty, 1994). However this modification does not improve the situation. Moreover, as we will see below, unacceptable errors can occur even in the case CR≪0.1. It means that the Consistency Ratio is not an acceptable EM error indicator.The right and the left eigenvector methods are two equivalent versions of the matrix measuring tool (see Section 4) and can be used equally to rank elements. However, a ranking, which uses only the mean values ω1, …, ωnand the mean inverse valuesω̃1,…,ω̃nof the elements Ω1, …, Ωnwithout taking account their errors, encounters the possibility ωi>ωkand1/ω̃i<1/ω̃kcalled “right and left eigenvector inconsistency” or “rank reversal problem for scale inversion”. This phenomenon is inseparably linked with inconsistencies of pairwise comparisons (see (19)). Our testing shows that all rank reversal examples (Johnson et al., 1979; Saaty, 1980; Dodd et al., 1995; Barzilai, 1997) correspond to such strong violation of the inequality (20) that the ranking loses sense.For illustration, we test the typical example (Dodd et al., 1995) with the reciprocal pairwise comparison matrixA=11399·1585··195···11····1.For this matrix, CR=0.082<0.1 (according to Saaty, it is acceptable), the right eigenvector has the entriesω1=0.3657,ω2=0.3896,ω3=0.1671,ω4=0.0347,ω5=0.0429,and the left eigenvector has the inverse entries1/ω̃1=0.4064,1/ω̃2=0.3642,1/ω̃3=0.1507,….We get the “rank reversal problem”: ω1<ω2 but1/ω̃1>1/ω̃2. However, according to (8), the actual values of the elements under consideration areω1±Δω1=0.3657±0.065,ω2±Δω2=0.3896±0.229Δω1+Δω2>12|ω1-ω2|or graphicallySimilar results are also obtained by the left eigenvector method. We see that the errors Δω1 and Δω2 are so large that the inequality ω1<ω2 (and1/ω̃1>1/ω̃2) does not contain any information on the ranking of the corresponding elements. Moreover, in this case the ranking loses any sense in principle. The “rank reversal problem” is not valid.EM has been criticized due to the possibility of rank reversal when the ranking of the initial elements is changed by the addition (or deletion) of some element. Hochbaum and Levin (2006) demonstrate the famous example with adding an inconsequential element. This example is based on two reciprocal pairwise comparison matricesA=11.21.2·11.5··1,A′=11.21.26·11.58··17···1corresponding to the initial and the final elements.For the matrix A, CR=0.016≪0.1, the right eigenvector has the normalized entries ω1=0.373, ω2=0.356, ω3=0.271. For the matrix A′, CR=0.021<0.1, the right eigenvector has the normalized entriesω1′=0.335,ω2′=0.347,ω3′=0.273.ω4′=0.045. We see the “rank reversal problem”: ω1>ω2, butω1′<ω2′. However, according to (8), the actual values of the elements under consideration areω1±Δω1=0.373±0.050,ω2±Δω2=0.356±0.048Δω1+Δω2≈6|ω1-ω2|andω1′±Δω1′=0.335±0.058,ω2′±Δω2′=0.347±0.054Δω1′+Δω2′≈9|ω1′-ω2′|.In both cases, the EM errors are so large that the inequalities ω1>ω2 andω1′<ω2′do not contain any information on the ranking of the elements (see (21)). Therefore this “rank reversal problem” is eliminated.Another example of rank reversal with adding a copy of the best existing element is demonstrated by Raharjo and Endah (2005). Their “rank reversal problem” has the same cause: the invalid use of only the means ω1, …, ωnfor the ranking.In the paper (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008), the condition of order preservation is formulated: “For all alternatives x1, x2, x3, x4 such that x1 dominates x2 and x3 dominates x4, if the evaluator’s judgements indicate the extent to which x1 dominates x2 is greater that the extent to which x3 dominates x4, then the vector of priorities w should be such that, not only w(x1)>w(x2) and w(x3)>w(x4) (preservation of order of preference) but also that w(x1)/w(x2)>w(x3)/w(x4) (preservation of order of intensity of preference)”. The authors present the examples in which the corresponding right eigenvector reversals the “order of intensity of preference”, and regard that it is a serious fundamental weakness of the EM.2These examples are also discussed by Wang et al. (2009), which transform original pairwise comparisons (direct judgments) to some “overall judgments” and obtain that “the priorities derived by the EM do preserve the order of intensity of preference, but in the sense of overall judgments rather than direct judgments”. They regard that their approach shows the invalidity of Bana e Costa and Vansnick’s criticisms. However, their arguments are only heuristic.2We regard that reversal of “order of intensity of preference”, “right–left asymmetry”, and “rank reversal” have the same cause: the invalid use of only principle eigenvector entries ω1, …, ωnfor ranking. Our testing shows that the problem is eliminated when we take into account the EM errors and use the actual values w(xk)=ωk±Δωkand the actual quotients(22)w(xi)w(xk)=ωi±Δωiωk∓Δωk=ωiωk+ΔωiΔωkωk2-Δωk2±±ωiΔωk+ωkΔωiωk2-Δωk2,i,k=1,2,…,that arise from the following:maxw(xi)w(xk)=ωi+Δωiωk-Δωk=ωiωk+ΔωiΔωkωk2-Δωk2+ωiΔωk+ωkΔωiωk2-Δωk2,minw(xi)w(xk)=ωi-Δωiωk+Δωk=ωiωk+ΔωiΔωkωk2-Δωk2-ωiΔωk+ωkΔωiωk2-Δωk2.For illustration, we test example (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 2008) for elements x1, x2, x3, x4 such that x1 dominates x2 2.5 times, x1 dominates x3 4 times, x1 dominates x4 9.5 times, x2 dominates x3 3 times, x2 dominates x4 6.5 times, x3 dominates x4 5 times. The corresponding reciprocal pairwise comparison matrix isA=12.549.5·136.5··15···1The right eigenvector of this matrix has the entries ω1=0.533, ω2=0.287, ω3=0.139, ω4=0.041. According to Bana e Costa and Vansnick, we have the violation of the “order of intensity of preference”: a34=5>4=a13, but ω3/ω4=3.4<3.8=ω1/ω3. However, Δω1=0.130, Δω2=0.084, Δω3=0.044, Δω4=0.011 and the actual quotients are w(x3)/w(x4)=4.0±2.2 and w(x1)/w(x3)=4.6±2.4 (see (22)). We see that the quotients w(x3)/w(x4) and w(x1)/w(x3) cannot be ranked. The violation of the “order of intensity of preference” is self-eliminated.
