Impact of structure, market share and information asymmetry on supply contracts for a single supplier multiple buyer network

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We study single supplier multiple buyer network under different settings of supply network structure.We examine the effect of market share and asymmetric information on four types of supply contracts.We calculate the optimal contract values for each type from the perspective of the supplier.The optimal transfer payment of a buyer is influenced by market share of the buyer and supply network structure.The supplier can collude with a buyer with less market potential to increase her assured profit level.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Market share of buyers and the influence of supply chain structure on the choice of supply contracts have received scant attention in the literature. This paper focuses on this gap and examines a network consisting of one supplier and two buyers under complete and partial decentralization. In the completely decentralized setting both buyers are independent of the supplier. In the partially decentralized setting the supplier and one of the buyers form a vertically integrated entity. Both buyers order from the single supplier and produce similar products to sell in the same market. The supplier charges the buyer through a contract. We investigate the influence of supply chain structure, market-share and asymmetry of information on supplier's choice of contracts. We demonstrate that both linear two-part tariff and quantity discount contract can coordinate the supply chain irrespective of the supply chain structure. By comparing profit levels of supply chain agents across different supply chain structures, we show that if a buyer possesses a minimum threshold market potential, the supplier has an incentive to collude with her. We calculate the cut-off policies for wholesale price and two-part tariff contracts by incorporating the reservation profit level of individual agents. The managerial implications of the analyses and the directions of future research are presented in the conclusion.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many established global brands have in recent times sub-contracted their manufacturing to firms in emerging countries in order to reduce costs, and have focused on design and marketing activities. However, some of the firms that supply to these global brands are also established brands themselves. Often such suppliers and buyers compete in the same end-product market; Acer, the Taiwanese manufacturer of computers and out-sourcing partner of Dell, is one such example in the electronics industry.11Elizabeth Woyke, “The Company Behind Your Laptop”, Forbes, 12/04/2009.

Almost identical situation arises when a monopolist supplier enters a new demographic market modifying an existing product to meet local requirements; she needs to find a local retailer for selling of the product (Corbett, Zhou, & Tang, 2004; Li & Gupta, 2011; Xu, Shi, Ma, & Lai, 2010). Also when one firm markets her product through a ‘firm-owned direct online channel as well through an independent traditional retail channel’, the second independent buyer views the supplier controlled first buyer as competition (Ryan, Sun, & Zhao, 2013).These business scenarios raise a set of questions: when one supplier is supplying to her own subsidiary and another buyer with the same raw material or end product, then how can the system be designed for achieving supply-chain coordination? Is there a possible mechanism to either reduce or eliminate conflict between the separate channels? Similar set of questions also arises if the supplier enters into a collusive agreement with an independent buyer. A buyer with smaller market share would always be interested in entering into such agreement with the supplier to improve her profit level; but can such an arrangement provide the supplier with any advantage?In this paper we attempt to answer all these questions by investigating competition between a vertically integrated firm and another firm with similar end products targeting the same market. Specifically we examine single supplier multiple buyers supply chain structure under (i) completely and partially decentralized setting, and (ii) information symmetry and asymmetry, in order to understand how the supply chain structure and the existing market share influence the design of contracts. We discuss four contract types, namely wholesale price (WP), quantity-discount (QD), linear two-part tariff (LTT), and nonlinear two-part tariff (NTT) contracts from the supplier's perspective. We compare between channel coordinating QD and LTT contracts. We find that under channel coordinating condition the supplier can either collude with an independent buyer or get into an arrangement with her sister division firm to create a win-win situation for both the firms such that they can improve their individual profit levels. In the context of WP and LTT contracts, we discuss the cut-off policies for different supply chain agents by incorporating their reservation profit levels. Finally, we numerically show how the supplier can design a preference matrix of contracts that enables her to choose contracts under different conditions of competition and market share of buyers.The remainder of this article is organized as follows: in Section 2 we review the related literature. We describe the problem settings and formulation of quantity-discount, wholesale price, linear two-part tariff and nonlinear two-part tariff contract problems in Section 3. In Section 4, we develop the solution in terms of optimal pricing and quantity decisions under the condition of symmetric and asymmetric information for completely decentralized and partially integrated supply chains respectively. We discuss the influence of supply chain structure, market share, value of information and cut-off policies in Section 5. Finally conclusions and possible future research directions are incorporated in Section 6.
