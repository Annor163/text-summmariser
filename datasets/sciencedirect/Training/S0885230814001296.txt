@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A vocal tract model based on a digital waveguide is presented in which the vocal tract has been decomposed into a number of convergent and divergent ducts. The divergent duct is modeled by a 2D-featured 1D digital waveguide and the convergent duct by a one dimensional waveguide. The modeling of the divergent duct is based on splitting the volume velocity into axial and radial components. The combination of separate modeling of the divergent and convergent ducts forms the foundation of the current approach. The advantage of this approach is the ability to get a transfer function in zero-pole form that eliminates the need to perform numerical calculations on a discrete 2D mesh. In this way the present model named as a 2D-featured 1D digital waveguide model has been found to be more efficient than the standard 2D waveguide model and in very good comparison with it in the formant frequency patterns of the vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/. The model has two control parameters, the wall and glottal reflection coefficients that can be effectively employed for bandwidth tuning. The model also shows its ability to generate smooth dynamic changes in the vocal tract during the transition of vowels.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Human speech production system consists of three main components like lungs, vocal folds and vocal tract. The coordination of these three components results into voiced sound, unvoiced sound or combination of these two. For voiced sound production like that of vowel, the air is pushed out from the lungs into the larynx. In the larynx, there are two identical vocal folds which are initially closed. The closure of the vocal folds causes a sub-glottal pressure. When this pressure rises above the resistance of the vocal folds, the vocal folds open themselves and air is passed through it. As the pressure decreases with the release of airflow, the vocal folds then close themselves quickly. The quasi-periodic opening and closing of the vocal folds continues due to constant supply of the air pressure from the lungs. Thus the vibration of the vocal folds forms a train of periodic pulses that acts as an excitation signal for the vocal tract. A non-uniform acoustic tube which extends from the glottis to the lips is called a vocal tract. The position of the vocal articulators like larynx, velum, jaw, tongue, and lips, forms a particular shape of the vocal tract. The shape of the vocal tract modifies spectral characteristics of the quasi-periodic air flow passing through it, which leads to the generation of voiced speech. In this way different shapes of the vocal tract generate different voiced speeches.Several approaches have been employed to model the voiced speech system on the basis of physical models such as cylindrical segments (Kelly and Lochbaum, 1962; Mullen et al., 2003) and conical segments (Välimäki and Karjalainen, 1994; Strube, 2003; Makarov, 2009) for the vocal tract modeling. In cylindrical approach, each tube segment of the vocal tract is modeled by the forward- and backward-traveling wave components of the solution of the wave equation (Morse, 1981; Smith, 1998) known as one-dimensional waveguide model. It was firstly used in Kelly–Lochbaum model of the human vocal tract for speech synthesis (Kelly and Lochbaum, 1962). However, the digital waveguide modeling (DWM), which is an extension of a one-dimensional waveguide, is recently being used in the modeling of the vocal tract (Van Duyne and Smith, 1993a,b; Cooper et al., 2006; Mullen et al., 2006, 2007; Speed et al., 2013). Digital waveguides are very popular for realistic and high quality sound generation in real time, and are successfully employed in physical modeling of sound synthesis.The greatest advantage of a 1-D digital waveguide model is that it has complete solution to the wave equation which is also computationally efficient for sound synthesis applications. Moving to higher dimensions leads to a number of limitations imposed on DWM models for an optimal solution to all sound synthesis systems. The most important one is the dispersion error, where the velocity of a propagating wave depends upon both its frequency and direction of traveling, leading to wave propagation errors and mistuning of the expected resonant modes. The dispersion error is highly dependent upon mesh topology and has been investigated in (Van Duyne and Smith, 1996; Fontana and Rocchesso, 2001; Campos and Howard, 2005). Another limitation is the restriction on sampling frequency. High sampling rates require high mesh density which corresponds to high computational cost.A 1D waveguide model is computationally efficient while the standard 2D and 3D waveguide models have better accuracy but heavy computational cost (Murphy and Howard, 2000; Campos and Howard, 2000; Beeson and Murphy, 2004; Murphy et al., 2007). In the present work we propose an efficient two-dimensional waveguide model of the vocal tract that has comparable formant frequencies with the standard 2D waveguide but has efficiency comparable to that of a 1D waveguide model. In the present model we approximate only the divergent part of the vocal tract by divergent ducts and consider two-dimensional volume velocity in it while in the convergent duct that represents convergent part of the vocal tract, we employ conventional one-dimensional approximation of the volume velocity. In this way the accuracy of the current model can never be better than the standard 2D waveguide model which considers two-dimensional volume velocity in the whole of the vocal tract. Therefore, we make it as a reference model for the comparison.The present results of the formant frequencies from the numerical simulation using area functions for specific vowels (Juszkiewicz, 2014) exhibit good comparison with the standard 2D waveguide model. The computational cost of the standard 2D waveguide is very high while the current approach is much more efficient.The present section is followed by five more sections. In Section 2, we describe our proposed vocal tract model. In this section, we also develop its mathematical formulation. Section 3 describes how to find a transfer function of the vocal tract. Section 4 is reserved for the numerical simulation of the model. Section 5 is dedicated for the results and discussion and Section 6 is for the conclusions.We derive a new model of vocal tract with a new transfer function relating it to pole-zero type linear prediction developed on the basis of the procedure given in (Kang and Lee, 1988). Current approach is to propose an efficient two-dimensional waveguide that has formant frequencies comparable with those of the standard 2D waveguide. We consider the vocal tract consisting of concatenated cylindrical acoustic tubes of same lengths but different cross-sectional areas. We define a convergent duct by the concatenation of two cylinders, where a cylinder with larger radius is followed by the one with the smaller radius. The connection of two cylinders in which a narrow cylinder is followed by a wider cylinder in the direction of flow is called a divergent duct. A serial combination of these two types of ducts constitutes the vocal tract. For example, in Fig. 1, the concatenation of the cylinders l1 and l2 forms a divergent duct while that of the cylinders l2 and l3 constitutes a convergent duct. Similarly concatenations of l3with l4, l4 with l5, l5 with l6 and l6 with l7 are labeled as divergent ducts while those of l7 with l8, l8 with l9 and l9 with l10 define convergent ducts.In the divergent duct, we assume that the volume velocity splits into its axial and radial components as shown in Fig. 2. The modeling of such ducts in the form of axial and radial components may improve the formant patterns of a 1D digital waveguide which are comparable with a 2D digital waveguide. The convergent duct may be represented by the usual 1D waveguide model as there is no 2D splitting of volume velocity at the entrance from a wider cylinder to the narrow one. The vocal tract is divided into cylindrical segments of same length so that the propagating time of sound wave through each cylindrical segment in an axial direction is same, say, τ. However, each of the uniform cylindrical segments may have a different cross-section area or diameter, so that the time taken for the sound wave to propagate through a cylindrical segment in a radial direction may not be an integer multiple of τ. In such a case, the delay in a radial direction will necessarily be a fractional delay (Laakso et al., 1996; Välimäki, 1995; Samadi et al., 2004). In the current model, it may be noted that in the divergent duct reflection of wave occurs at two different places, one is where impedance changes and the other is at the wall of the cylindrical tube. This leads to the presence of two different types of delays in the modeling of divergent duct. The delay in a transverse direction is formulated as the absolute difference of the radii of the two concatenated cylindrical tubes, which will necessarily be a fractional delay and has been approximated by the Lagrange interpolator (Laakso et al., 1996; Välimäki, 1995; Samadi et al., 2004).For the formulation of the model, we consider a divergent duct consisting of two cylindrical tubes of cross-sectional areasAiandAi+1as shown in Fig. 2. When the volume velocity enters from the ith tube into the (i+1)th tube, it splits into an axial componentui+1along the vocal tract and a radial componentvi+1in a transverse direction. We use local coordinate system in the ith divergent duct. Therefore, the origin for the splitting of volume velocity into the axial and radial directions lays at the junction of the ith and (i+1)th cylinders as shown in Fig. 2. When the volume flow is along the direction of the vocal tract, the acoustic impedance depends on the cross-sectional area of the cylinder. The cross-sectional area of a cylinder is an area in which the volume flow occurs normal to this area. If we consider the volume flow in a radial direction then the volume flow occurs normal to the surface area which leads to the assumption that the impedance of volume flow in a radial direction may depend on the surface area of the cylinder. For this purpose, we can assume an imaginary cylinder of appropriate cross-sectional area intruded into the (i+1)th cylinder shown by dotted line in Fig. 2 in which volume velocity along the vocal tract isui+1. A transverse componentvi+1may be regarded as the volume velocity coming out of the surface of this imaginary cylinder in a transverse direction so that it may be considered as proportional to its surface area. In this way we can control axial and transverse volume velocity componentsui+1andvi+1by changing the radius of the imaginary cylinder. It may be noted that the radius of the imaginary cylinder will necessarily be a fraction of the radius of the ith cylinder because otherwise there can be no transverse component in the (i+1)th cylinder, and may be expressed askri, where0<k≤1. The surface area of this imaginary cylinder whose length is equal to that of the (i+1)th cylinder, may be written as(1)Bi+1=0ifAi>Ai+12π(kri)li+1ifAi<Ai+1We denote byui(x,t)andpi(x,t)respectively, the volume velocity and the acoustic pressure at position x and time t within the ith cylindrical tube. Then by solving the well-known momentum equation and mass continuity equation (Markel and Gray, 1976; Rabiner and Shafer, 1978), we obtain(2)ui(x,t)=ui+t−xc−ui−t+xc(3)pi(x,t)=ρcAiui+t−xc+ui−t+xcwhere c is the velocity of sound in air, ρ is the density of air and the + and − signs denote the forward and backward traveling components, respectively.Letlbe the length of any cylindrical tube as all tubes have same length. Under the above assumptions, the acoustic pressure at the junction of the two cylinders forming a divergent duct is identical in either direction and the total volume velocity is preserved. We, then, have the following boundary conditions at the junction of the ith and (i+1)th cylinders.(4)pi(l,t)=pi+1(0,t)=p′i+1(0,t)(5)ui(l,t)=ui+1(0,t)+vi+1(0,t)wherep′i+1represents pressure in the transverse direction and other quantities are as defined earlier. We have used local coordinate system in which x=0 is the entrance location of the ith cylinder and x=l is its exit location.Substituting (2) and (3) into (4) and (5), we get(6)ui+(t−τ)+ui−(t+τ)=AiAi+1[ui+1+(t)+ui+1−(t)]=AiBi+1[vi+1+(t)+vi+1−(t)](7)ui+(t−τ)−ui−(t+τ)=[ui+1+(t)−ui+1−(t)]+[vi+1+(t)−vi+1−(t)]whereτ=l/c,is the time required to travel the cylindrical tube.From Eq. (6), we have(8)ui+1+(t)=Ai+1Ai[ui+(t−τ)+ui−(t+τ)]−ui+1−(t)(9)vi+1+(t)=Bi+1Ai[ui+(t−τ)+ui−(t+τ)]−vi+1−(t)Using Eqs. (8) and (9) in Eq. (7) we haveui−(t+τ)=Ai−Ai+1−Bi+1Ai+Ai+1+Bi+1ui+(t−τ)+2AiAi+Ai+1+Bi+1ui+1−(t)+2AiAi+Ai+1+Bi+1vi+1−(t).If we letri=Ai−Ai+1−Bi+1Ai+Ai+1+Bi+1, then the above equation becomes(10)ui−(t+τ)=riui+(t−τ)+(1+ri)ui+1−(t)+(1+ri)vi+1−(t),which can be rearranged to give(11)ui+(t−τ)=1riui−(t+τ)−1+ririui+1−(t)+1+ririvi+1−(t).In these equationsriis known as reflection coefficient.Using Eqs. (10) and (11) in Eq. (7), then the following matrix form can be obtained:(12)ui+(t−τ)ui−(t+τ)=11−ri1riri1ui+1+(t)ui+1−(t)+vi+1+(t)vi+1−(t)Now, we consider the boundary conditions at the lips and the glottis. For these cases, we use standard approach of 1D digital waveguide model (Kelly and Lochbaum, 1962).A mathematical relation for the lips radiation is given as (Markel and Gray, 1976; Rabiner and Shafer, 1978)(13)uN−(t+τ)=−rLipuN+(t−τ),whererLipis the reflection coefficient at the lips.LetrL=−rLip, then by using Eq. (13), the output volume velocity at the lips can be written as (Markel and Gray, 1976; Rabiner and Shafer, 1978)(14)uN(l,t)=uN+(t−τ)−uN−(t+τ)=(1−rL)uN+(t−τ).Similarly, for the glottis section, we have the following mathematical relation (Markel and Gray, 1976; Rabiner and Shafer, 1978)(15)u1+(t)=1+rG2uG(t)+rGu1−(t).whererGis the reflection coefficient at the glottis.The time domain representation of the present vocal tract model consists of Eqs. (12)–(15). However, this representation is not computationally convenient for the study of vocal tract formant frequencies. In the next section, we derive another representation of this model in the z-domain using z-transformation.In this section we derive the transfer function of the above vocal tract model in pole-zero type form by transforming the model from time-domain to z-domain using z-transformation. This representation provides convenient means for studying the model characteristics.First of all we assume that we have a vocal tract model with N cylindrical tubes of equal length and delay in each tube is considered as half-sample delay, i.e., we sample everyT=2τsamples, whereτis the time required to traverse each tube. We denote byUi+(z)andUi−(z)as per convention the z-transformed representations of volume velocity componentsui+(t)andui−(t), respectively. We putτ=1/2in Eq. (12) and apply z-transformation on it which leads to the following matrix form:(16)Ui+(z)Ui−(z)=z1/21−ri1ririz−1z−1Ui+1+(z)Ui+1−(z)+Vi+1+(z)Vi+1−(z).By applying z-transformation, Eq. (6) takes the form(17)Vi+1+(z)+Vi+1−(z)=qi+1[Ui+1+(z)+Ui+1−(z)],whereqi+1=Bi+1Ai+1.So far we have derived a simple expression for the current model in the form of three equations represented by Eqs. (16) and (17). These three equations are not suitable for the derivation of the transfer function and need to be reduced into two equations. For this, we defineGi+1(z)as(18)Gi+1(z)=Vi+1−Vi+1+.From Eqs. (17) and (18), we obtain(19)Vi+1+(z)Vi+1−(z)=qi+11+Gi+1(z)11Gi+1(z)Gi+1(z)Ui+1+Ui+1−.By using Eq. (19) into Eq. (16), we have(20)Ui+(z)Ui−(z)=z1/21−riPi(z)Qi(z)Ri(z)Si(z)Ui+1+(z)Ui+1−(z),wherePi(z)=1+qi+11+Gi+1(z)(1+riGi+1(z)),Qi(z)=ri+qi+11+Gi+1(z)(1+riGi+1(z)),Ri(z)=z−1ri+qi+11+Gi+1(z)(Gi+1(z)+ri),Si(z)=z−11+qi+11+Gi+1(z)(Gi+1(z)+ri),whereriis defined as earlier.Now Eq. (20) leads to the desired system of two equations for the derivation of the transfer function.For the boundary conditions at the lips, we add a fictitious (N+1)th cylindrical tube of infinite length such that there is no negative-going wave component. We, then, have (Markel and Gray, 1976; Rabiner and Shafer, 1978)(21)UN+1+=UL(z)UN+1−=0.So Eq. (20) can be written for the lips as(22)UN+(z)UN−(z)=z1/21−rNPN(z)QN(z)RN(z)SN(z)UN+1+(z)UN+1−(z)=z1/21−rNPN(z)QN(z)RN(z)SN(z)UL(z)0=z1/21−rNPN(z)QN(z)RN(z)SN(z)10UL(z)Similarly, by taking the z-transformation of Eq. (15), the boundary conditions at the glottis can be written as (Markel and Gray, 1976; Rabiner and Shafer, 1978)(23)UG(z)=21+rG,−2rG1+rGU1+(z)U1−(z).The transfer function is evaluated by the relationH(z)=UL(z)/UG(z). By combining Eqs. (20), (22) and (23), the transfer function is thus obtained as(24)H(z)=0.5(1+rG)∏i=1N(1−ri)z−N/2[1,−rG]∏i=1NPi(z)Qi(z)Ri(z)Si(z)10,Eq. (24) gives the transfer function of the current model in z-domain.In our model of the vocal tract,Gi+1(z)represents the delay in a transverse direction for divergence duct. For the evaluation of transfer function, we develop an expression forGi+1(z)in terms of z-variable. For this, we assume that the radii of the first and second cylindrical tubes arehiandhi+1. Then, transverse delay time in the (i+1)th cylinder tube denoted byτ′i+1can be written as:(25)τ′i+1=hi+1−hic=di+1c,wherehi<hi+1anddi+1=hi+1−hi.(26)Letηi+1=di+1l,wherelis the length of theithcylindrical tube.di+1=ηi+1ldi+1c=ηi+1lc(27)τ′i+1=ηi+1τ,whereηi+1is a real number.(28)τ′i+1=ηi+12,whenτ=12Eq. (27) represents a transverse delayτ′i+1in terms of the delayτ.Let we introducerWbe the reflection coefficient at the wall, then on the wall of the cylindrical tube (as shown in Fig. 2).(29)vi+1−(t+τ′i+1)=rWvi+1+(t−τ′i+1)Eq. (29) can be rewritten as(30)vi+1−t+ηi+12=rWvi+1+t−ηi+12.Taking z-transformation of Eq. (30), we have(31)zηi+1/2Vi+1−(z)=rWz−ηi+1/2Vi+1+(z),which in view of Eq. (18) gives the following representation ofGi+1(z)in terms of z-variable:(32)Gi+1(z)=rWz−ηi+1.This completes all the requirements for the evaluation of the transfer function. The block diagram is shown in Fig. 3.Here, we give the numerical solution procedure that was adopted for solving a 2D waveguide model. These results will be used as criteria for evaluating our present a 2D-featured 1D waveguide model.One of the most significant advantages of a 1D-digital waveguide that makes it a realistic proposition for application in sound synthesis is the computational efficiency which is lost when we move to higher dimensional digital waveguide. A 2D waveguide model is found to give more accurate formant synthesis, producing vowels that give a good match to the real-world targets (Mullen, 2006; Mullen et al., 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007; Rugchatjaroen and Howard, 2012). The current approach has its advantage of better frequency formants than those of a 1D digital waveguide and comparable with a 2D-waveguide while maintaining its computational efficiency comparable to that of a 1D-digital waveguide. In others words, the current approach improves the accuracy without significant increase in the computational cost. Another drawback of the higher dimensional digital waveguide model is the limitation of the sampling frequency being inversely proportional to the travel time between two scattering junctions as may be seen in Eq. (33). The denser the mesh is used in terms of the number of scattering junctions for better accuracy, the higher the frequency and the computational cost. As a consequence, the whole vocal tract model has to be run at the sampling rate which is much higher than necessary for voice synthesis. However, the current approach preserves the sampling frequency of a 1D digital waveguide.In this work, the length of the vocal tract has been chosen as 17.5cm (Wakita, 1977; Mullen et al., 2006; Mathur et al., 2006). The vocal tract model has been divided into 32 equal cylindrical segments starting from the glottal end in order to gain sampling frequency approximately 32kHz for the speech. In all simulations, boundary reflection coefficientsrGat glottis,rLat lips andrWat walls are chosen as 0.97, 0.90 and 1.0, respectively.The area function at any point is defined to be the cross-sectional area of the cylindrical tube containing that point. In this way the area function becomes piecewise constant as the cross-sectional area changes only on moving from one tube to the other. Moreover, the area function is defined in terms of the diameter of the tube in order to construct the physical structure of the vocal tract. The physical structure of the vocal tract is represented by the waveguide of same impedance. A highly fine rectilinear mesh of 600 nodes is employed along an axial direction and multiple waveguides along a radial direction depending upon the value of the diameter (Mullen et al., 2006; Murphy and Beeson, 2007). This configuration leads to a fixed delay size of 17.5/600=0.02917cm. Due to this fixed delay size, mesh nodes along a radial direction depend upon the maximum value of the diameter in each vowel. Since maximum value of the diameter varies from one vowel to the other, therefore, number of radial mesh nodes will vary accordingly. The cross-sectional areas of the five vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/ are listed in Table 1(Juszkiewicz, 2014). In our demonstration of a 2D waveguide, the 4-port rectilinear mesh has been used and the mesh sizes of the five vowels are 600×112, 600×128, 600×128, 600×156 and 600×142, respectively. To make an ideal vocal tract, wall boundary reflection coefficientrWis set to 1 at each cylindrical segment.The sampling frequency for the N-dimensional waveguide is determined by (Mullen et al., 2006; Murphy and Beeson, 2007)(33)Fs=cNd,where c is the speed of sound approximated by 345m/s, N is the dimension of the mesh and d is the delay size. By Eq. (33), the current configuration of mesh leads to the sampling rates of 1672.8kHz for a 2D waveguide.For the case of 1D waveguide, Eq. (33) can be written as(34)Fs=cd.Eq. (34) is used for the full-sample delay model in which there is only a forward wave in every other tube at each instant of time and a backward wave in every other. The model is made more efficient when the delay in one segment is half a sample, meaning that two consecutive steps of the full-sample model are combined into a single step which leads to the efficiency of the model. In our presentation, we consider half-sample delay model and Eq. (34) is, then, rewritten as (Mathur et al., 2006; Lim and Lee, 1993)(35)Fs=c2dBy taking vocal tract length 17.5cm, each segment length is obtained as d=0.546875cm which leads to the sampling frequency ofFs=31.5kHz.As the length of each cylindrical segment is same, the propagating time of sound wave through each cylindrical segment in an axial direction will also be the same say τ. However, since each of the uniform cylindrical segments may have a different cross-sectional area or diameter, the time taken by the sound wave to propagate through a cylindrical segment in a radial direction may not be an integer multiple of τ. In such a case, the delay in a radial direction is necessarily a fractional delay (Laakso et al., 1996; Välimäki, 1995; Samadi et al., 2004). Since the present model also considers the delay in a radial direction, the transfer function of our model will necessarily contain the fractional delay which has been approximated by Lagrange interpolator (Laakso et al., 1996; Välimäki, 1995; Samadi et al., 2004), a type of FIR filter. Lagrange interpolation is popular for easy and fast calculation of the filter coefficients. It has very good magnitude and phase response at low frequencies with the magnitude response never exceeding one. For comparison at higher frequencies, we need to retain maximal flatness of the FIR filter up to higher frequencies. This could be done by increasing the order of the filter which depends upon the value of the fractional delay. In our work, we gain maximal flatness of the filter by multiplyingz−10by the numerator and denominator of the transfer function. This approach does not change frequency and phase responses of the transfer function but increases the order of the filter.In the present model we approximate only the divergent part of the vocal tract by divergent ducts and consider two-dimensional volume velocity in it while in the convergent duct that represents convergent part of the vocal tract, we employ conventional one-dimensional approximation of the volume velocity. In this way the accuracy of the current model can never be better than the standard 2D waveguide model which considers two-dimensional volume velocity in the whole of the vocal tract. Therefore, we make it as a reference model for the comparison.
