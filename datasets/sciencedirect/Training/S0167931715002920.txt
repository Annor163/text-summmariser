@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The impact of subjecting a n-GaN surface to an in-situ argon plasma in an atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool immediately before deposition of an Al2O3 dielectric film is assessed by frequency dependent evaluation of Al2O3/GaN MOSCAPs. In comparison with a control with no pre-treatment, the use of a 50W argon plasma for 5min reduced hysteresis from 0.25V to 0.07V, frequency dispersion from 0.31V to 0.03V and minimum interface state density (Dit) as determined by the conductance method from 6.8×1012cm−2eV−1 to 5.05×1010cm−2eV−1.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
To suppress gate leakage current in GaN-based power electronic transistors, the incorporation of high-k dielectrics such as Al2O3, HfO2 and ZrO2 deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD) in the gate stack have been studied [1–4]. Issues associated with trapped charge at the dielectric to GaN or AlGaN interface have been observed however, along with threshold voltage (Vth) instabilities. To address these issues, there have been a number of recent reports on the impact of wet and dry cleans prior to dielectric deposition [5–7]. To date there has been no report on the impact of subjecting a GaN surface to an Ar plasma in-situ in the ALD deposition chamber immediately prior to Al2O3 deposition, which is the subject of the work reported here.The impact of this approach is assessed by frequency dependent capacitance–voltage (C–V) and conductance–voltage (G–V) characteristics in terms of hysteresis, frequency dispersion and interface state density (Dit) at the Al2O3/GaN interface.The GaN MOSCAP structure was grown on a 6″ diameter silicon wafer by MOCVD. The complete layer structure, from the silicon substrate up shown in Fig. 1, comprises; a 0.22μm AlN nucleation layer, a 0.85μm undoped graded AlGaN layer, a 1.1μm 1×1018cm−3 Si doped GaN layer to facilitate the formation of a low resistance ohmic contact as the bottom plate of the MOSCAP, and a 0.6μm 1×1017cm−3 Si doped GaN layer. The low conductivity of the AlN nucleation layer necessitated the use of a planar MOSCAP structure whose fabrication began with the deposition of a Ti/Al/Ni/Au ohmic metallization which was annealed at 770°C for 30s in N2 atmosphere to form a low resistance path to the 1.1μm 1×1018cm−3 Si doped GaN layer in the epi-structure. Prior to being introduced into the Al2O3 growth chamber, samples were cleaned using organic solvents. Before ALD deposition of Al2O3, samples were subjected to a 5min Ar plasma treatment in-situ in the ALD chamber at plasma powers of 50W, 150W and 300W. After the pre-treatment, 20nm Al2O3 was deposited at 200°C using a trimethyl-aluminum (TMA) precursor. It has been shown before that dosing the compound semiconductor with TMA first results in self-cleaning, which can remove contaminants before the onset of the dielectric growth occurs [8]. Following ALD deposition, windows were opened in the Al2O3 layer by reactive-ion etching using SiCl4 gas to facilitate probing to the ohmic contact. A 20/200nm Ni/Au metallization was then deposited to form the gate contact of the MOSCAP.Finally, post metal annealing in forming gas for 30min at 430°C was performed. Fig. 1 shows a cross section TEM image of a typical n-GaN based MOSCAP.
