@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper examines the problem of output feedback control of a Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy fishery system. The considered system is the continuous age structured model of an exploited population that includes a nonlinear stock–recruitment relationship. The effort is used as control term, the age classes as states and the quantity of captured fish per unit of effort as measured output. In order to stabilize the stock states around the references equilibrium, which means biologically the sustainability of the fish stock, the output feedback controller is adopted, rather than a controller based on the state observer. An algorithm based on the linear matrix inequality is proposed to compute the static output feedback gain. Simulation results of the continuous fishery systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
One of the desirable objectives in the management of fisheries resources is the conservation of the fish population. The formulation of good harvesting policies which take into account this objective is complex and difficult to achieve. It can be realized by stabilizing the stock states around the reference equilibrium, which means biologically the sustainability of the fish stock. In order to solve this control engineering problem several researchers use state feedback as controller. However in fisheries systems, the resources cannot be counted directly, except with acoustic method which is not generalized yet, so the state feedback control law is not realizable. In order to solve this problem, the current paper deals with the synthesis of the output feedback control law to stabilize the states variables around the reference equilibrium [1]. But in [1] the studied model is a structured model with two age classes only, and the application of the Jurdjevic–Quinn [2] method to a model with n (n>2) age classes is complex. To overcome this limitation, a different technique based on the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) [3] multimodel approach is introduced, in order to compute the static output feedback gain for this fishery system.During the last two decades, T–S fuzzy models have attracted the attention of many researchers [4–10]. They offer the possibility to apply some tools coming from the linear theory, whereas those models are composed of linear submodels blended with fuzzy membership functions. The study of stabilization is very often done using a direct Lyapunov approach, and especially with the well-known quadratic functions [11]. T–S fuzzy systems can represent exactly a nonlinear model [11], from this exact model, static output feedback control law may be designed based on the linear subsystems [12].To the best of our knowledge, the problem of stabilizing exploited fish population systems through static output feedback control law and using T–S fuzzy models has not been studied in the literature. In this work a static output feedback control law based on Takagi–Sugeno multimodel approach is proposed and applied to a continuous nonlinear fish population system. The controller gain is calculated using linear matrix inequalities (LMI) [13].The outline of this paper is as follows. First, in Section 2, the T–S type fuzzy model is briefly presented to model the fishery system, and based on Lyapunov's approach; a stability criterion is derived to guarantee the stability of the fishery system via an LMI formulation. Then, Section 3 deals with the description of the continuous stage structured model, which is transformed to a T–S fuzzy model. In Section 4, the procedure to design the control law is applied, and simulations using numerical data of some fisheries models are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.In the following the concept of T–S multiple model is introduced. The main idea of the T–S fuzzy modeling method is to partition the nonlinear system dynamics into several locally linearized subsystems, so that the overall nonlinear behavior of the system can be captured by fuzzy blending of such subsystems through nonlinear fuzzy membership functions. Unlike conventional modeling techniques which use a single model to describe the global behavior of a nonlinear system, fuzzy modeling is essentially a multi-model approach in which simple submodels (typically linear models) are fuzzily combined to describe the global behavior of a nonlinear system.The continuous-time T–S fuzzy system is described as a set of N rules, where each rule i uses p membership functions (Mi1,…,Mip) and p fuzzy variables (z1(t),…,zp(t)), as follows:ModelRulei:IFz1(t)isMi1and…andzp(t)isMipTHENx˙(t)=Aix(t)+Biu(t)y˙(t)=Cix(t)Here, Mijis the fuzzy set, r is the number of model rules, x(t)∈Rnis the state vector, u(t)∈Rmis the input vector, y(t)∈Rqis the output vector, Ai∈Rn×n, B∈Rn×m, and C∈Rq×n; z1(t),…,zp(t) are known premise variables that may be functions of the state variables, external disturbances, and/or time.z(t) will be used to denote the vector containing all the individual elements z1(t),…,zp(t). Given a pair of (x(t),u(t)), and using singleton fuzzifier, max-product inference and center average defuzzifier, the aggregated fuzzy model can be written as:(1)x˙(t)=∑i=1rwi{z(t)}{Aix(t)+Biu(t)}∑i=1rwi(z(t))where z(t)=[z1(t)z2(t)…zp(t)], andwi{z(t)}=∏j=1pMij{zj(t)}.The term Mij{zj(t)} is called the membership function. It is the grade of membership of zj(t) in Mij. Eq. (1) can be written as follows:(2)x˙(t)=∑i=1rμi{z(t)}{Aix(t)+Biu(t)}whereμi{z(t)}=wi{z(t)}/∑j=1rwj{z(t)}. μi{z(t)} is called the activation function.Since∑i=1rwi{z(t)}>0andwi{z(t)}≥0,i=1,2,…r,one has:∑i=1rμi{z(t)}=1and μi{z(t)}≥0, i=1, 2, …, r, for all t.The global output of T–S model is interpolated as follows:(3)y(t)=∑i=1rμi{z(t)}Cix(t)An LMI-based design method using fuzzy state feedback control has been proposed in [14]. However, in real-world control problems, the states may not be completely accessible. In such cases, one needs to resort to output feedback design methods that are useful when only the output of the system is available. An attempt to solve this problem was the synthesis of the static output feedback control law to stabilize the state variables around the reference equilibrium [1]. But in [1] the studied model is a structured model of two age classes only, and the application of the Jurdjevic–Quinn [2] method to a model of n (n>2) age classes is complex. Thus, fuzzy static output feedback control is the most desirable since it can be implemented easily with low cost.In the literature, the main control law used as a nonlinear static output feedback is the output parallel distributed compensation (OPDC). In the OPDC synthesis, each control rule is designed from the corresponding rule of a T–S fuzzy model. The designed fuzzy controller shares the same fuzzy sets with the fuzzy model in the premise parts. For the fuzzy models (3) the following fuzzy controller via the OPDC law is constructed:ControlRulei:IFz1(t)isMi1and…andzp(t)isMipTHENu(t)=Fiy(t)i=1,2,…,rThe overall fuzzy control law is composed of several linear output feedbacks blended together using the nonlinear functions μi(·) of the model:(4)u(t)=∑i=1rμi{z(t)}Fiy(t)The fuzzy controller design is to find the local feedback gains Fi∈Rmqin the consequent parts.In the sequel, it is assumed that Ci=C, i=1,…,r, is full row rank. By substituting (4) into (2), the closed-loop fuzzy system under consideration is:(5)x˙(t)=∑i=1rμi{z(t)}μi{z(t)}{(Ai+BiFiC)x(t)}The stability of the closed-loop system (5) has been investigated in the literature: see [11] and the references there in. Here, a previous result on the stabilization of continuous-time fuzzy systems that are obtained via a quadratic Lyapunov function [12] is announced. It deals with sufficient conditions in LMIs form to ensure asymptotic stability of (5).Theorem 1[12]Suppose that there exist matrices Ni, M, S and Q such that(6a)Q>0,S>0QAiT+AiQ+CTNiT+BiNiC+(s−1)S<0i=1,2,…,r(6b)Q(Ai+Aj)T+(Ai+Aj)Q+CT(NjTBjT)+(BiNi+BjNi)C−2s≤0i=1,2,…,rand(7)CQ=MCwith μi(z(t))μi(z(t))≠0. Then the T–S model (5) is globally asymptotically stable with the OPDC controller (4) where(8)Fi=NiM−1∀i∈{1,…,r}s is the number of submodels simultaneously activated.–Note that the design conditions presented above (Theorem 1) are only sufficient conditions. A major advantage of these conditions compared especially with the application of the Jurdjevic–Quinn [2] method used in [1] is that they are cast into an LMI form, and therefore easily solvable.Theorem 1 overcomes the source of conservatism for the proposed design in [1]. Obtained results are not valid in an invariant domain only.The modeling of the exploitation of biological resources like fisheries and forestries has gained importance in recent years. In order to understand the biology and development of the particular species, to optimize the catching of fish, to stabilize and to aid the preservation of the fish population in marine ecosystems, various dynamic models for commercial fishing were proposed and analyzed by considering the economic and biological factors: global models that give a general vision of the stock, which is represented with a single variable [15,16], and structured models that distinguish between several stages (classes of ages, of sizes, …) of the stock, the evolution of each one is described separately [1,17–20]. Age – or stage – structure was included in the modeling of harvested populations, particularly fish and forests [18]. Early models were linear and deterministic [21], progressing later to models that include density dependence [22], or seasonal effects [23].The study of continuous age structured model has received a great importance from scientists. In [24] the continuous age population model was studied, especially the model structured into three stages: larvae, juveniles and adults [24] whose respective stocks (x1;x2;x3)∈R3+follow the dynamics:x˙1=−α1x1−m1x1+r(t,x3)x˙2=−α1x1−α2x2−m2x2x˙3=−α2x2−m3x3−c(t)x3y=x3The positive coefficients α1 and mirepresent the growth and mortality rates, respectively. In this model the births in x1 class are generated only by the adults class x3 with a reproduction law of Beverton Holt type: r(t, x3)=a(t)x3/(b+x3). The term c(t) in the third equation represents a harvesting effort on the adult population.A typical instance of such a system is used to model population of fishes harvested by fishermen [16], but the same model is also met within the metabolic field [24]. The n stages structured model with the same structure was studied by [25,26]. In [19] the authors built the continuous age structured model in fishery with n+1 classes which is the subject of our study. The first class X0 is constituted of the pre-recruits, i.e. the eggs, the larvae and the juveniles. The other classes are the post-recruits or the exploited phase of the population.The dynamics of the system are modeled by the following n+1 dimensional system [1,17,19](9)X˙0=−α0X0+∑i=1nFiXi−∑i=1npiXiX0−p0X02X˙1=αX0−(α1+q1E)X1⋮⋮X˙n=αXn−1−(αn+qnE)Xnwhere αi=α+Mi;Miis the natural mortality of the individuals of the ith stage class; α is the linear aging coefficient; p0 is the juvenile competition parameter; piis the predation parameter of class i on class 0; Fiis the mean number of eggs deposited by ith fertile adult in the unit of time; qiis the catchability of the individuals of the ith stage class; Xiis the biomass of class i; E is the fishing effort at time t and is regarded as an input.The harvest function is defined as:(10)h(t)=∑i=1nqiE(t)Xi(t)Here qi>0 is the catchability coefficient, defined as the fraction of the population fished by a unit of the fishing effort E(t), which is the intensity of the human activities to extract the fish. In general, fishing effort is regulated by quotas, trip limits and gear restrictions.Eq. (10) implies that the harvest function Y(t) called also the total catch per unit of effort is regarded as output of the system (9) and is defined as:(11)Y(t)=∑i=1nqiXi(t)Now the existence of the equilibrium of (9) is studied, with a focus on the interior or positive equilibrium. For any constant fishing effort E0 the positive equilibrium exists only for some restricted levels of the parameters (pi,Fi,αi,qi).X*=(X0*,X1*,…,Xn*)Tis an equilibrium for the system (9) if it satisfies the equation X=0, which is equivalent to:−α0X0*+∑i=1nFiX0*−∑i=0npiXi0X0*=0⋮⋮⋮αXn−1*−(αn+qnE)Xn*=0It follows that the system (9) admits two equilibrium points for a constant fishing effort E0. The possible equilibria are:(i)The trivial equilibrium (0,…,0).The interior (positive) equilibriumX*=(X0*,X1*,…,Xn*)Tdefined as:X0*=∑i=1nFiπi−α0∑i=1npiπi+p0andXi*=πiX0*whereπi=α1/(∏j=1i(αj+qjE¯))For the equilibrium X* to be positive, two conditions are needed.–First:∑i=0npi≠0this means that one non linearity at least must be considered.Then,∑i=1nFiπi>α0this means biologically that the spawning coefficient must be big enough so as to avoid extinction.LetE¯be a constant fishing effort. Using the change of coordinatexi=Xi−Xi*and=E−E¯, the system (9) can be written as a “quasi-linear parameter variant” called “quasi-LPV” model. This form is an affine form in the state and the input of the nonlinear system and is given by:(12a)x˙=A(x)x+B(x)u(12b)y=CxwhereA=k0−p0x0−p1x1kn−pnxnα−(α1+q1E¯)⋯00α⋱0⋮⋱⋱000−(αn+qnE¯)withk0=−(α0+2p0X0*+∑i=1npiXi*)andki=Fi−piXi*; i=1,…,n,B=0−q1X1*−q1x1−q2X2*−q2x2⋮−q3X3*−q3x3−qnXn*−qnxnand y=Y−Y* with Y*=CX* and C=[q1q2…qn].Eq. (12) will be used in the next paragraph with the sector nonlinearity approach [11] to build the T–S fuzzy model of the considered fish population system.For simplicity, one considers here a population with three age classes (n=2), andxi∈[−a,a],a∈ℝ*+. Stage 0 represents the abundance of juvenile; stage 1 represents the young adult abundances without reproduction and cannibalism; and the stage 2 represents adults’ abundances with the same term of predation and the same proportion on the females mature but have different reproduction rate. The modeling approach used in this section is the sector non-linearity procedure [11].The system (12) has three non-constant terms: x0, x1 and x2. For non-constant terms, define:zi(t)=xii=0, 1, 2Next, the minimum and maximum values of zi(t) under xi∈[−a, a] are calculated. They are obtained as follows:maxzi(t)=a,minzi(t)=−aFrom the maximum and minimum values, zi(t) can be represented by:zi(t)=Mi1(zi(t))⋅a+Mi2(zi(t))(−a)whereMi1(zi(t))+Mi2(zi(t)=1.Therefore the membership functions can be calculated as:Mi1(zi(t))={zi(t)+a}/2aMi2(zi(t))={a−zi(t)}/2aThe membership functionsM01,M11,M12,M21andM22are named “Positive,” “Negative,” “Zero,” “Not zero,” “Big,” and “Small,” respectively. Then, the nonlinear system (5) is represented by the following fuzzy model.ModelRule1:IFz0(t)is“Negative”andz1(t)is“NotZero”andz2(t)is“Big”THENx˙(t)=A1x(t)+B1u(t)ModelRule2:IFz0(t)is“Negative”andz1(t)is“NotZero”andz2(t)is“Small”THENx˙(t)=A2x(t)+B2u(t)ModelRule3:IFz0(t)is“Negative”andz1(t)is“Zero”andz2(t)is“Big”THENx˙(t)=A3x(t)+B3u(t)ModelRule4:IFz0(t)is“Negative”andz1(t)is“Zero”andz2(t)is“Small”THENx˙(t)=A4x(t)+B4u(t)ModelRule5:IFz0(t)is“Positive”andz1(t)is“NotZero”andz2(t)is“Big”THENx˙(t)=A5x(t)+B5u(t)ModelRule6:IFz0(t)is“Positive”andz1(t)is“NotZero”andz2(t)is“Small”THENx˙(t)=A6x(t)+B6u(t)ModelRule7:IFz0(t)is“Positive”andz1(t)is“Zero”andz2(t)is“Big”THENx˙(t)=A7x(t)+B7u(t)ModelRule8:IFz0(t)is“Positive”andz1(t)is“Zero”andz2(t)is“Small”THENx˙(t)=A8x(t)+B8u(t)Here, z0(t), z1(t) and z2(t) are premise variables andA1=k0+p0ak1+p1ak2+p2aα−(α1+q1)E¯00α−(α2+q2)E¯;B1=0−q1X1*−q1a−q2X2*−q2aA2=k0+p0ak1+p1ak2+p2aα−(α1+q1)E¯00α−(α2+q2)E¯;B2=0−q1X1*−q1a−q2X2*−q2aA3=k0+p0ak1+p1ak2+p2aα−(α1+q1)E¯00α−(α2+q2)E¯;B3=0−q1X1*−q1a−q2X2*−q2aA4=k0+p0ak1+p1ak2+p2aα−(α1+q1)E¯00α−(α2+q2)E¯;B4=0−q1X1*−q1a−q2X2*−q2aA5=k0+p0ak1+p1ak2+p2aα−(α1+q1)E¯00α−(α2+q2)E¯;B5=0−q1X1*−q1a−q2X2*−q2aA6=k0+p0ak1+p1ak2+p2aα−(α1+q1)E¯00α−(α2+q2)E¯;B6=0−q1X1*−q1a−q2X2*−q2aA7=k0+p0ak1+p1ak2+p2aα−(α1+q1)E¯00α−(α2+q2)E¯;B7=0−q1X1*−q1a−q2X2*−q2aA8=k0+p0ak1+p1ak2+p2aα−(α1+q1)E¯00α−(α2+q2)E¯;B8=0−q1X1*−q1a−q2X2*−q2aThe activation functions of this eight-rule fuzzy model are:μ1(z(t))=M02(z0(t))×M11(z1(t))×M21(z2(t))μ2(z(t))=M02(z0(t))×M11(z1(t))×M22(z2(t))μ3(z(t))=M02(z0(t))×M12(z1(t))×M21(z2(t))μ4(z(t))=M02(z0(t))×M12(z1(t))×M22(z2(t))μ5(z(t))=M01(z0(t))×M11(z1(t))×M21(z2(t))μ6(z(t))=M01(z0(t))×M11(z1(t))×M22(z2(t))μ7(z(t))=M01(z0(t))×M12(z1(t))×M21(z2(t))μ8(z(t))=M01(z0(t))×M12(z1(t))×M22(z2(t))Thus, (9) can be rewritten as:(13)x˙(t)=∑i=18μi{z(t)}{Aix(t)+Biu(t)}where μi, Aiand Biare defined as described is this Section 3.4.RemarksThe model (9) of the form (13) has several advantages:–It is an exact representation of (9) and not an approximation [27]. In [20], an approximation was used. But an accurate approximation of a non-linear system can only be expected in the vicinity of an equilibrium point.It is the convex combination of local affine models, which facilitates the stability analysis and controller and observer design.Many already available stability and design conditions for Takagi–Sugeno system can be formulated as LMIs [4–12], for which efficient algorithms exist that test their feasibility [11,13].To demonstrate the effectiveness and the convergence of the state to the equilibrium, a numerical example is considered, it is obtained from the stabilization of a fishery characterized by the parameter values given in Table 1.The initial states and the constant fishing effort are arbitrarily chosen as:E¯=1and X0=(1.57;1.24;0.95). For these parameters the numerical equilibrium point is X*=(3.37;2.04;1.45).Using an LMI solver (Yalmip interface [28] coupled to SeDuMi solver) gives the values of the matrixes Ni, M, S and Q that satisfies (6) and (7), and also gains Fifor the output feedback controller (8) that stabilizes the system:S=1.6443−0.6216−0.23368−0.62160.5152−0.0412−0.2368−0.04121.2522Q=29.158211.6055−11.605511.605513.3513−12.3513−11.6055−12.351313.3513M=1;N1=417.7132; N2=555.0376N3=756.1982; N4=1.3258e+003N5=372.3880; N6=512.6334N1=681.1827; N8=1.1304e+003F1=417.7132; F2=.0376F3=756.1982; F4=1.3258e+003F5=372.3880; F6=512.6334F7=681.1827; F8=1.1304e+003The obtained results for this case are shown in Fig. 1, they present the states time evolution of the states xi, for i=1, 2 and 3, and control law, respectively.Anchovy is an important commercial species and one of the abundant pelagic fish in most seas. To this end a numerical example for this species (5 age classes) is studied. In this paragraph, a numerical example obtained from the stabilization of a fishery characterized by the parameter values which are retained from the literature [5,6,11,12] is studied.It is assumed that the biological parameter values as well as the fishing strategy are known and are given by Table 2.For these parameters the numerical equilibrium point is: X*=(18.9;15.5;12.1;5.75;2.2).The components of the closed-loop system obtained for this fishery are illustrated in Fig. 2, which shows the convergence of the curves toward the non-trivial steady states.The regulation parameters are (Table 3):M=2.4606e−17S=1.0e−15*0.03680.0026−0.05260.0119−0.00120.00260.2766−0.09770.00340.0278−0.0526−0.09770.0463−0.0003−0.03940.01190.0034−0.00030.1178−0.0098−0.00120.0278−0.0394−0.00980.0567Q=1.0e−14*0.0813−0.01520.0013−0.0009−0.00460.01520.3919−0.0083−0.0005−0.00240.0013−0.00830.0068−0.00110.0010−0.0009−0.0005−0.00110.0037−0.0025−0.0046−0.00240.0010−0.00250.0052The lifespan of sardine is 7 years. The age of sexual maturity is 2 years. To show numerical results for the state feedback control, one considers a population of sardine (seventh stages). Stage 0 represents the biomass of juvenile; stage 1 represents the young adult's biomass without reproduction and cannibalism; the stages 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are adult's abundances with the same term of predation and the same proportion on the female mature but have different reproduction. To study the linear global stabilization one considers a population with normalized stock model. Initialled with X(0)=(3.57,2.24,0.95,0.54,0.54,0.53,0.38). The other normalized parameters are shown in Table 4.
