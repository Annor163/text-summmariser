An orthonormal frame(f1,f2,f3)is rotation-minimizing with respect tofiif its angular velocityωsatisfiesω⋅fi≡0— or, equivalently, the derivatives offjandfkare both parallel tofi. The Frenet frame(t,p,b)along a space curve is rotation-minimizing with respect to the principal normal p, and in recent years adapted frames that are rotation-minimizing with respect to the tangent t have attracted much interest. This study is concerned with rotation-minimizing osculating frames(f,g,b)incorporating the binormal b, and osculating-plane vectors f, g that have no rotation about b. These frame vectors may be defined through a rotation of t, p by an angle equal to minus the integral of curvature with respect to arc length. In aeronautical terms, the rotation-minimizing osculating frame (RMOF) specifies yaw-free rigid-body motion along a curved path. For polynomial space curves possessing rational Frenet frames, the existence of rational RMOFs is investigated, and it is found that they must be of degree 7 at least. The RMOF is also employed to construct a novel type of ruled surface, with the property that its tangent planes coincide with the osculating planes of a given space curve, and its rulings exhibit the least possible rate of rotation consistent with this constraint.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A general spatial motion of a rigid body is specified by describing its position and orientation as functions of time. A particular point of the body (e.g., the center of mass) is usually chosen to describe position. To describe orientation, the variation of an orthonormal frame(e1,e2,e3)embedded within the body may be specified. In general, position and orientation vary independently, but in certain motion problems they may be correlated. This study is concerned with constrained spatial motions, in which the instantaneous angular velocity of a rigid body is related to the geometry of its center-of-mass path.The Frenet frame is the most familiar orthonormal frame on a space curve, comprising the tangentt, principal normalp, and binormalb=t×p. When the Frenet frame is used to orient a body along a path, its angular velocityωsatisfiesω⋅p≡0— i.e., it has no component in the principal normal direction. This means that the body exhibits no instantaneous rotation about the principal normal vector p from point to point along the path.In aerodynamics, an embedded frame is used (Cook, 1997) to characterize variations in the attitude of an aircraft, in terms of roll, pitch, and yaw axes through its center of mass — the roll (or longitudinal) axis is aligned with the fuselage; the pitch (or lateral) axis is orthogonal to it, within the plane of the fuselage and wings; and the yaw (or vertical) axis is orthogonal to that plane. Hence, pitch and yaw correspond to up/down and left/right motions of the aircraft nose, while roll corresponds to a rotation about the fuselage.A rigid body that maintains alignment with the Frenet frame on a given spatial path exhibits a pitch-free motion — it has no instantaneous rotation about the principal normal p. For a given (smooth) path, it is also possible to construct roll-free and yaw-free rigid-body motions, characterized by no instantaneous rotation about the tangent t and binormal b, respectively.Roll-free motion, with angular velocity satisfyingω⋅t≡0, has recently enjoyed considerable attention. In this case, the body has no instantaneous rotation about the tangent t from point to point along the path. Bishop (1975) first studied adapted orthonormal frames(t,u,v)comprising the tangent t and normal-plane vectors u, v that have no instantaneous rotation about t, in lieu of p, b. Klok (1986) described the vectors u, v as solutions to differential equations, and Guggenheimer (1989) subsequently showed that these solutions amount to defining u, v by a normal-plane rotation of p, b through an angle equal to minus the integral of the torsion with respect to arc length.For polynomial or rational curves, this rotation-minimizing adapted frame (RMAF) is not, in general, a rational locus, and this fact has prompted many approximation schemes (Farouki and Han, 2003; Jüttler and Mäurer, 1999; Wang et al., 2008). More recently, interest has emerged in identifying curves with rational rotation-minimizing frames (RRMF curves), which must be Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves (Farouki, 2008), since only PH curves possess rational unit tangents. The Euler–Rodrigues frame (ERF), a rational adapted frame defined on any PH curve, is a useful intermediary in identifying RRMF curves (Choi and Han, 2002; Han, 2008). The simplest non-planar RRMF curves form a subset of the PH quintics (Farouki et al., 2009a), characterized by the satisfaction of simple constraints on the curve coefficients (Farouki, 2010). Further details on the basic theory, properties, and applications of RRMF curves can be found in Barton et al. (2010), Farouki et al. (2012), Farouki and Sakkalis (2010, 2012).Among the spatial motions mentioned above, in which angular velocity is correlated with local path geometry, the least-studied is the case of yaw-free motion satisfyingω⋅b≡0. In yaw-free motion, the orientation of the body is specified by a frame(f,g,b)that retains the binormal b, but the tangent and principal normal t, p are replaced by osculating-plane vectors f, g that have no instantaneous rotation about b. It is shown below that the vectors f, g can be defined through an osculating-plane rotation of t, p by an angle equal to minus the integral of the curvature with respect to arc length. We call the frame(f,g,b)a rotation-minimizing osculating frame (RMOF).The plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the concept of rotation-minimizing frames on curves, and briefly mentions how it can also be used to identify certain special curves on a smooth surface (geodesics, lines of curvature, and asymptotic lines). Section 3 addresses the problem of rational rotation-minimizing frames — after briefly reviewing rational RMAFs, a detailed analysis of rational RMOFs on cubic and quintic space curves with rational Frenet frames is presented. Section 4 employs the RMOF to construct ruled surfaces interpolating a space curve, with tangent planes matching the osculating planes of that curve, and derives some useful properties of such surfaces. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the key results of this study, and identifies some open problems.The parametric speed of a differentiable space curver(ξ)is defined byσ(ξ)=|r′(ξ)|=ds/dξ,where s is the cumulative arc length ofr(ξ), measured from some fixed point. The curver(ξ)is regular if its parametric speed satisfiesσ(ξ)≠0for all ξ. The variation of an orthonormal frame(e1(ξ),e2(ξ),e3(ξ))defined alongr(ξ)may be specified by its angular velocityω(ξ)through the relations(1)e1′=σω×e1,e2′=σω×e2,e3′=σω×e3.Since(e1,e2,e3)comprise a basis forR3we can write(2)ω=ω1e1+ω2e2+ω3e3,and hence the relations (1) become(3)e1′=σ(ω3e2−ω2e3),e2′=σ(ω1e3−ω3e1),e3′=σ(ω2e1−ω1e2).For a given reference direction, specified by a unit vector fieldc(ξ)alongr(ξ), one may characterize frames(e1(ξ),e2(ξ),e3(ξ))that are rotation-minimizing with respect toc(ξ)as follows.Definition 1The frame(e1,e2,e3)is rotation-minimizing with respect to c if its angular velocityωhas no component in the direction of c, i.e.,ω⋅c≡0.Now if the frame vectore1(ξ)is chosen as the reference direction, the rotation-minimizing frame (RMF) satisfiesω1≡0in (2). Eqs. (3) then yield an alternative characterization, in terms of the derivatives ofe2(ξ)ande3(ξ).Corollary 1The frame(e1,e2,e3)is rotation-minimizing with respect toe1whene2′ore3′is always parallel toe1along the curver(ξ). An analogous characterization holds whene2ore3is chosen as the reference direction.For a frame that is rotation-minimizing with respect toe1, the vectorse2,e3exhibit no instantaneous rotation aboute1. They vary only becausee1varies alongr(ξ), and they must remain orthogonal to it. This is equivalent to the observation in Corollary 1 that the derivatives ofe2,e3are parallel toe1.The Frenet frame(t,p,b)on a space curver(ξ)is defined (Kreyszig, 1959) by(4)t=r′|r′|,p=r′×r″|r′×r″|×t,b=r′×r″|r′×r″|.The tangentt is the instantaneous direction of motion along the curve, the principal normalp points to the center of curvature, and the binormalb=t×pcompletes the frame. The orthogonal planes spanned by(t,p),(p,b), and(b,t)are the osculating, normal, and rectifying planes, respectively.The angular velocity of the frame (4) is given (Kreyszig, 1959) by the Darboux vector(5)ω=κb+τt,where the curvatureκ(ξ)and torsionτ(ξ)ofr(ξ)are defined byκ=p⋅t′σ=|r′×r″||r′|3andτ=−p⋅b′σ=(r′×r″)⋅r‴|r′×r″|2.When(e1,e2,e3)=(t,p,b)andωis specified by (5), the relations (1) are equivalent (Kreyszig, 1959) to the well-known Frenet–Serret equations(6)[t′p′b′]=σ[0κ0−κ0τ0−τ0][tpb].Remark 1From Definition 1, we observe that the Frenet frame is rotation-minimizing with respect to the principal normal p, but not with respect to the tangent t or binormal b. For a plane curve, it is also rotation-minimizing with respect to the tangent t.Although the Frenet frame is not rotation-minimizing with respect to t, one can easily derive such a rotation-minimizing frame from it. New normal-plane vectors(u,v)are specified through a rotation of(p,b)according to(7)u=cosθp+sinθb,v=−sinθp+cosθb,where (Guggenheimer, 1989) we define(8)θ(ξ)=θ0−∫0ξτσdξ,θ0being an integration constant — note that the minus sign is missing from (8) in Guggenheimer (1989). It is assumed in (7) thatr(ξ)is free of inflections, so p and b are defined at each point. The frame(t,u,v)has angular velocity(9)ω=κb=κ(sinθu+cosθv),satisfyingω⋅t≡0. A frame incorporating the tangent t is an adapted frame, and when it is rotation-minimizing with respect to t it is called a rotation-minimizing adapted frame (RMAF). Such frames describe natural spatial motions of a rigid body that maintains one principal axis aligned with the path tangent, while the other principal axes have no instantaneous rotation about the tangent. These motions are useful in computer animation, the use of sweep operations in geometric design, robot path planning, programming of CNC machines with rotary axes, and related applications.By modification of the Frenet frame, one can also define a frame that is rotation-minimizing with respect to the binormal b. New osculating-plane vectors(f,g)are specified through a rotation of(t,p)according to(10)f=cosθt+sinθp,g=−sinθt+cosθp,where, in this case, we define(11)θ(ξ)=θ0−∫0ξκσdξ.Usingθ′=−σκand (6), the variation of(f,g,b)is described byf′=σω×f,g′=σω×g,b′=σω×b, where the frame angular velocity is(12)ω=τt=τ(cosθf−sinθg).Evidentlyω⋅b≡0, and this frame is rotation-minimizing with respect to b. Since the vectors f, g span the osculating plane, and exhibit no instantaneous rotation about the normal b to that plane along the curver(ξ), we say that(f,g,b)is a rotation-minimizing osculating frame (RMOF).Example 1For the circular helix defined by(13)r(ϕ)=(Rcosϕ,Rsinϕ,kϕ)the Frenet frame can be specified in terms of the parametersa=R/R2+k2andb=k/R2+k2ast=(−asinϕ,acosϕ,b),p=(−cosϕ,−sinϕ,0),b=(bsinϕ,−bcosϕ,a)and the parametric speed, curvature, and torsion areσ=R2+k2,κ=a/σ,τ=b/σ. The angular deviation (8) of the RMAF normal-plane vectors(u,v)from the Frenet frame vectors(p,b)is thusθ=θ0−bϕ. Hence, forθ0=0, the RMAF basis vectors (7) areu=(−cosϕcosbϕ−bsinϕsinbϕ,−sinϕcosbϕ+bcosϕsinbϕ,−asinbϕ),v=(−cosϕsinbϕ+bsinϕcosbϕ,−sinϕsinbϕ−bcosϕcosbϕ,acosbϕ).Fig. 1compares the Frenet frame and RMAF normal-plane vectors along the helix (13) withR=2.5andk=0.6. The angular deviation (11) of the RMOF osculating-plane vectors(f,g)from the Frenet frame vectors(t,p)isθ=θ0−aϕ, and hence forθ0=0the RMOF basis vectors (10) aref=(−asinϕcosaϕ+cosϕsinaϕ,acosϕcosaϕ+sinϕsinaϕ,bcosaϕ),g=(−asinϕsinaϕ−cosϕcosaϕ,acosϕsinaϕ−sinϕcosaϕ,bsinaϕ).Fig. 2compares the Frenet frame and RMOF osculating-plane vectors.For the Frenet frame(t,p,b)we have(ω1,ω2,ω3)=(τ,0,κ)from (5), so a body aligned with this frame along the pathr(ξ)exhibits pitch-free motion. For the rotation-minimizing adapted frame(t,u,v)we have(ω1,ω2,ω3)=(0,κsinθ,κcosθ)from (9), so a body aligned with the RMAF exhibits roll-free motion. Finally, for the rotation-minimizing osculating frame(f,g,b)we have angular velocity components(ω1,ω2,ω3)=(τcosθ,−τsinθ,0)from (12), and hence a body aligned with the RMOF exhibits yaw-free motion.Rotation-minimizing frames can also offer intuitive characterizations for certain special curves on smooth surfaces. The Darboux frame(n,t,h)along a surface curve comprises the surface normal n, the curve tangent t, and the tangent normalh=n×t— i.e., a unit vector in the surface tangent plane, orthogonal to the curve tangent. The variation of the Darboux frame is specified (Kreyszig, 1959; Struik, 1961) in terms of its angular velocityΩ=κgn−τgt−κnhby the relationsn′=σΩ×n,t′=σΩ×t,h′=σΩ×h, whereκg=h⋅t′σ,τg=h⋅n′σ,κn=n⋅t′σ,are the geodesic curvature, geodesic torsion, and normal curvature along the surface curve. In terms of these quantities, the geodesics, line of curvatures, and asymptotic lines on a smooth surface may be characterized (Kreyszig, 1959; Struik, 1961) as loci along whichκg≡0,τg≡0, andκn≡0, respectively. From Definition 1, we obtain the following alternative succinct characterizations, which are useful in the construction of surface patches bounded by geodesics (Farouki et al., 2009c; Paluszny, 2008; Sánchez-Reyes and Dorado, 2008); lines of curvature (Biard et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Martin, 1983); and asymptotic lines (Bayram et al., 2012).Proposition 1A surface curve is (i) a geodesic; (ii) a line of curvature; or (iii) an asymptotic line, if and only if the Darboux frame(n,t,h)is rotation-minimizing with respect to (i) the surface normaln; (ii) the curve tangentt; or (iii) the tangent normalh.Exact rational frames are preferable to approximations when possible, since they provide a precise and efficient means of orienting a rigid body along a given path. After briefly reviewing the theory of rational RMAFs below, we consider its adaptation to the problem of identifying rational RMOFs.The existence of rational RMAFs on polynomial space curves has recently been studied (Farouki, 2010). A polynomial space curve with a rational RMAF must be a Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve, since only the PH curves have rational unit tangents (Farouki, 2008). The distinctive property of a polynomial PH curver(ξ)=(x(ξ),y(ξ),z(ξ))is that its derivative components satisfy (Farouki, 2008) the condition(14)|r′(ξ)|2=x′2(ξ)+y′2(ξ)+z′2(ξ)=σ2(ξ)for some polynomialσ(ξ). A spatial PH curve may be generated (Choi et al., 2002) from a quaternion polynomial(15)A(ξ)=u(ξ)+v(ξ)i+p(ξ)j+q(ξ)kand its conjugateA⁎(ξ)=u(ξ)−v(ξ)i−p(ξ)j−q(ξ)kthrough the product(16)r′(ξ)=A(ξ)iA⁎(ξ)=[u2(ξ)+v2(ξ)−p2(ξ)−q2(ξ)]i+2[u(ξ)q(ξ)+v(ξ)p(ξ)]j+2[v(ξ)q(ξ)−u(ξ)p(ξ)]k.Alternatively, one may use complex polynomials(17)α(ξ)=u(ξ)+iv(ξ),β(ξ)=q(ξ)+ip(ξ),in the Hopf map expression(18)r′(ξ)=(|α(ξ)|2−|β(ξ)|2,2Re(α(ξ)β¯(ξ)),2Im(α(ξ)β¯(ξ))).Lemma 1If the complex polynomials in(18)are of the formα(ξ)=f(ξ),β(ξ)=eiψg(ξ)for realf(ξ),g(ξ)the curve defined by integrating(18)is planar. Furthermore, ifg(ξ)=kf(ξ)for real k, it is just a straight line.ProofWhenα(ξ)=f(ξ)andβ(ξ)=eiψg(ξ)for constant ψ, we havex′(ξ)=f2(ξ)−g2(ξ),y′(ξ)=2f(ξ)g(ξ)cosψ,z′(ξ)=−2f(ξ)g(ξ)sinψ.Sincesinψy′(ξ)+cosψz′(ξ)=0, we havesinψy″(ξ)+cosψz″(ξ)=0andsinψy‴(ξ)+cosψz‴(ξ)=0. Hence, the last two columns of the determinant(r′(ξ)×r″(ξ))⋅r‴(ξ)=|x′(ξ)y′(ξ)z′(ξ)x″(ξ)y″(ξ)z″(ξ)x‴(ξ)y‴(ξ)z‴(ξ)|are linearly dependent, so the torsion vanishes and the curve is planar. Also, note that expression (18) reduces tor′(ξ)=f2(ξ)(1−k2,2kcosψ,−2ksinψ)ifg(ξ)=kf(ξ), which defines a straight line. Lemma 1 also holds in the caseα(ξ)=eiψf(ξ),β(ξ)=g(ξ).  □On the PH curve defined by (15) and (16), a rational orthonormal adapted frame — the Euler–Rodrigues frame (ERF) — is defined (Choi and Han, 2002) bye1(ξ)=A(ξ)iA⁎(ξ)|A(ξ)|2,e2(ξ)=A(ξ)jA⁎(ξ)|A(ξ)|2,e3(ξ)=A(ξ)kA⁎(ξ)|A(ξ)|2.Heree1is the curve tangent whilee2,e3span the normal plane. The variation of the ERF is characterized by its angular velocityωthrough (1), whereσ(ξ)=|r′(ξ)|=u2(ξ)+v2(ξ)+p2(ξ)+q2(ξ)is the parametric speed of the PH curver(ξ). Han (2008) showed that the PH curve defined by (15)–(16) possesses a rational RMAF if and only if relatively prime polynomialsa(ξ),b(ξ)exist, such thatu(ξ),v(ξ),p(ξ),q(ξ)satisfy(19)uv′−u′v−pq′+p′qu2+v2+p2+q2=ab′−a′ba2+b2.This is equivalent to the existence of a rational normal-plane rotation that maps the ERF vectorse2(ξ),e3(ξ)onto the RMAF vectorsu(ξ),v(ξ)so the ERF angular velocity component in thee1direction is exactly cancelled. For PH quintics, specified by quadratic quaternion polynomials with Bernstein coefficientsA0,A1,A2, the condition for a rational RMAF may be expressed (Farouki, 2010) as a single constraint on these coefficients, namelyA2iA0⁎+A0iA2⁎=2A1iA1⁎.In the Hopf map model, this is equivalent (Farouki, 2010) to the constraintsRe(α0α¯2−β0β¯2)=|α1|2−|β1|2,α0β¯2+α2β¯0=2α1β¯1on the Bernstein coefficientsα0,α1,α2andβ0,β1,β2ofα(t)andβ(t).The existence of rational RMOFs(f,g,b)on polynomial space curves is a more difficult problem. Whereas all PH curves have rational tangentst(ξ), their principal normalsn(ξ)and binormalsb(ξ)do not, in general, depend rationally on the curve parameter, because of the|r′(ξ)×r″(ξ)|term in (4). To ensure a rational binormal vector, the expression|r′×r″|2=(y′z″−y″z′)2+(z′x″−z″x′)2+(x′y″−x″y′)2must be the perfect square of a polynomial in ξ. Now it can be shown (Farouki et al., 2004, 2009b) that every PH curve satisfies the relation|r′(ξ)×r″(ξ)|2=4σ2(ξ)ρ(ξ),where the polynomial ρ can be expressed in terms of u, v, p, q andu′,v′,p′,q′in several different ways (Farouki, 2008), the simplest being(20)ρ=(up′−u′p+vq′−v′q)2+(uq′−u′q−vp′+v′p)2.Hence, the binormal vector is rational if and only if we have(21)ρ(ξ)=γ2(ξ)for some polynomialγ(ξ), i.e.,(22)|r′×r″|2=(y′z″−y″z′)2+(z′x″−z″x′)2+(x′y″−x″y′)2=4(σγ)2.Polynomial curves satisfying (14)and(22) are double PH (DPH) curves (Beltran and Monterde, 2007; Farouki et al., 2009b). They have rational Frenet frames, curvature, and torsion, defined by(23)t=r′σ,p=σr″−σ′r′2σγ,b=r′×r″2σγ,κ=2γσ2,τ=(r′×r″)⋅r‴4σ2γ2.Remark 2Because of their rational Frenet frames, curvature, and torsion, we shall focus here on rational RMOFs on DPH curves, and do not address at present the existence of non-DPH curves that possess rational binormals and admit rational rotation-minimizing osculating-plane basis vectors f, g.A (general) helix is characterized by the fact that its tangent t maintains a constant inclination ψ (the pitch angle) with respect to a fixed direction a (the axis of the helix) and the curvature/torsion ratio is constant (Kreyszig, 1959; Struik, 1961). A polynomial helix must be a PH curve (Farouki et al., 2004) — in fact, a DPH curve (Farouki et al., 2009b). All PH cubics and all helical PH quintics are DPH curves, but non-helical DPH curves of degree ⩾7 exist. Complete details may be found in Beltran and Monterde (2007), Farouki et al. (2009b), Monterde (2009).Remark 3For any DPH curve, the Frenet frame specifies a rational pitch-free motion, since the Frenet frame is rotation-minimizing with respect to the principal normal, and it is also rational for double PH curves.The ERF is of no use in constructing a rational RMOF, since it does not incorporate the binormal b and two rational vectors spanning the osculating plane, to which a rotation can be applied to cancel the angular velocity component in the direction of b. Instead, we use the rational Frenet frame (23) for a DPH curve, and seek a rational osculating-plane rotation(24)[f(ξ)g(ξ)]=1a2(ξ)+b2(ξ)[a2(ξ)−b2(ξ)−2a(ξ)b(ξ)2a(ξ)b(ξ)a2(ξ)−b2(ξ)][t(ξ)p(ξ)]that maps the Frenet frame vectorst(ξ),p(ξ)to the RMOF vectorsf(ξ),g(ξ)and cancels theκbcomponent of the Frenet frame angular velocity (5).Now (10) and (24) giveθ=−2tan−1b/aandθ′=2(a′b−ab′)/(a2+b2), and if (24) defines an RMOF, we must haveθ′=−κσfrom (11). Thus, we deduce from (23) that a DPH curve satisfying (14) and (22) has a rational RMOF if and only if polynomialsa(ξ),b(ξ)exist, such that(25)γu2+v2+p2+q2=ab′−a′ba2+b2.Every spatial PH cubic is a helical curve (Farouki and Sakkalis, 1994), and also a DPH curve (Farouki et al., 2009b). Such curves admit a closed-form (but not rational) expression for the RMOF. A cubic space curve with control pointsp0,p1,p2,p3and control polygon leg vectorsL0=p1−p0,L1=p2−p1,L2=p3−p2is a PH curve (Farouki and Sakkalis, 1994) if and only ifL0,L2lie on a right-circular cone of half-angleϑ⩽12πaboutL1as axis, and their azimuthal separation φ on this cone is given by(26)cosφ=1−2L12L0L2,whereLi=|Li|. Adopting suitable coordinates, one may assume thatL1=L1(0,0,1),L0=L0(sinϑ,0,cosϑ),L2=L2(sinϑcosφ,sinϑsinφ,cosϑ), with φ satisfying (26) andL1⩽L0L2. The parametric speed is then(27)σ(ξ)=|r′(ξ)|=3[L0(1−ξ)2+L1cosϑ2(1−ξ)ξ+L2ξ2],whereΔ=L0L2−L12cos2ϑ⩾0, so thatσ(ξ)⩾0for all ξ. Since|r′×r″|=6L1sinϑσ(ξ)and(r′×r″)⋅r‴=108(L0×L1)⋅L2, the curvature and torsion can be expressed (Farouki and Sakkalis, 1994) in terms of (27) as(28)κ(ξ)=6L1sinϑσ2(ξ),τ(ξ)=−3L0L2sinφL1σ2(ξ).Hence, the angle function (11) that specifies that RMOF vectors f, g in terms of the Frenet frame vectors t, p is given byθ(ξ)=θˆ0−2L1sinϑΔtan−1(L1cosϑ−L0)(1−ξ)+(L2−L1cosϑ)ξΔ,whereθˆ0=θ0+(2L1sinϑ/Δ)tan−1((L1cosϑ−L0)/Δ).Proposition 2The condition(25)for a rational RMOF can be satisfied by PH cubics only in the degenerate case of planar curves.ProofSince|r′×r″|2=4(σγ)2and|r′×r″|=6L1sinϑσwe see thatγ(ξ)=3L1sinϑis a constant. Substituting this together with (27) for the denominator on the left in (25), and assuminga(ξ)=a0(1−ξ)+a1ξ,b(ξ)=b0(1−ξ)+b1ξon the right, satisfaction of (25) requires thata0b1−a1b0=3L1sinϑ,a02+b02=3L0,a0a1+b0b1=3L1cosϑ,a12+b12=3L2.Withc0=a0+ib0,c1=a1+ib1these equations are equivalent to|c0|2=3L0,c¯0c1=3L1eiϑ,|c1|2=3L2, and we must have|c0|=3L0,|c0||c1|=3L1,|c1|=3L2. From (26) these conditions imply thatcosφ=−1,sinφ=0. It then follows from (28) that the torsion vanishes, so the curve is planar.  □One is thus led to consider satisfaction of (25) in the case of DPH quintics, which are equivalent to the quintic helical polynomial space curves: for such curves,γ(ξ)is a quadratic polynomial. The characterization of curves that have rational RMOFs, as solutions to (25), is more difficult than the problem of identifying curves with rational RMAFs, satisfying (19). Unlike (19), the numerator polynomial on the left in (25) is not known explicitly in terms of u, v, p, q — instead, γ must be determined from conditions (20)–(21).Now for the polynomials (17) defining the Hopf map form (18), we haveαβ′−α′β=(uq′−u′q−vp′+v′p)+i(up′−u′p+vq′−v′q),and hence (20) can be written asρ=|αβ′−α′β|2. The condition (21) for ρ to be a perfect square is thus equivalent (Farouki et al., 2009b; Monterde, 2009) to the requirement that(29)α(ξ)β′(ξ)−α′(ξ)β(ξ)=h(ξ)w2(ξ)for a real polynomialh(ξ)and complex polynomialw(ξ)=r(ξ)+is(ξ)withgcd(r(ξ),s(ξ))=1, wheredeg(h)+2deg(w)=2max(deg(α),deg(β))−2. The polynomialγ(ξ)defined by (21) is then given byγ(ξ)=h(ξ)|w(ξ)|2.For DPH quintics withmax(deg(α),deg(β))=2, the solutions to (29) may be categorized according to whether (a)deg(h)=0anddeg(w)=1; or (b)deg(h)=2anddeg(w)=0. These correspond (Beltran and Monterde, 2007; Farouki et al., 2004, 2009b; Monterde, 2009) to the monotone helical and general helical PH quintics, respectively — the former maintain a fixed sense of rotation of the tangent t about the axis a, while the latter may exhibit a reversal of the sense of rotation.In case (a) we may seth(ξ)=1andw(ξ)=w0(1−ξ)+w1ξwithout loss of generality. Satisfaction of (29) by quadratic polynomialsα(t)andβ(t)with Bernstein coefficientsα0,α1,α2andβ0,β1,β2then implies that(30)(α0β1−α1β0,α0β2−α2β0,α1β2−α2β1)=(12w02,w0w1,12w12)which is equivalent to(α0β1−α1β0)(α1β2−α2β1)=14(α0β2−α2β0)2. If this constraint is satisfied andw0,w1are complex values determined from (30), the polynomialγ(ξ)in the rational RMOF condition (25) has the formγ(ξ)=|w0|2(1−ξ)2+Re(w¯0w1)2(1−ξ)ξ+|w1|2ξ2.In case (b) we seth(ξ)=h0(1−ξ)2+h12(1−ξ)ξ+h2ξ2andw(ξ)=eiζwithout loss of generality. Then satisfaction of (29) implies that(31)(α0β1−α1β0,α0β2−α2β0,α1β2−α2β1)=(12h0ei2ζ,h1ei2ζ,12h2eiζ)i.e.,α0β1−α1β0,α0β2−α2β0,α1β2−α2β1are just real multiples of each other. In this case, with the coefficients ofα(t)andβ(t)satisfying (31), the polynomialγ(ξ)in (25) has the formγ(ξ)=h0(1−ξ)2+h12(1−ξ)ξ+h2ξ2.Eqs. (30) and (31) differ only in the complex values on the right. We now consider their solutions for general values(z0,z1,z2)≠(0,0,0)on the right, focusing on the “generic” case withz1≠0andz0α2+z2α0≠0(the casesz1=0orz0α2+z2α0=0also yield only linear or planar curves: since the arguments for these cases are rather technical, we omit them).Remark 4If(z0,z1,z2)=(0,0,0)the left-hand side of (25) vanishes, and it is satisfied witha(ξ),b(ξ)constant, i.e., the Frenet frame is an RMOF. But this occurs only if the curvature vanishes, so the curve is just a straight line.Proposition 3Forz1≠0, the solutions to the system of equations(32)α0β1−α1β0=z0,α0β2−α2β0=z1,α1β2−α2β1=z2,wherez0α2+z2α0≠0may be defined be expressingα1,β0,β2in terms ofα0,α2,β1as(33)α1=z0α2+z2α0z1,β0=(α0β1−z0)z1z0α2+z2α0,β2=(α2β1+z2)z1z0α2+z2α0.ProofWriting (32) as a linear system forβ0,β1,β2in the form(34)[−α1α00−α20α00−α2α1][β0β1β2]=[z0z1z2],the matrix on the left is seen to be of rank 2. Solutions exist if and only if the3×4augmented matrix, defined by appending the vector on the right in (34) as a fourth column to the matrix on the left, is also of rank 2. The determinants of the three3×3matrices defined by combining two of the first three columns of the augmented matrix with the last column areα2(z0α2+z2α0−z1α1),−α1(z0α2+z2α0−z1α1),α0(z0α2+z2α0−z1α1).Now(α0,α1,α2)=(0,0,0)cannot satisfy (32) ifz1≠0, so we must havez0α2+z2α0−z1α1=0.This condition yields the expression forα1in (33) and if it holds, Eqs. (34) admit solutions in which one ofβ0,β1,β2may be treated as a parameter. Choosingβ1as the free parameter, and substituting forα1into the first and third equations of (32), we obtain the expressions forβ0,β2in (33).  □Hence, when Eqs. (32) are satisfied withz1≠0andz0α2+z2α0≠0, we can expressα(t),β(t)in terms ofα0,α2,β1andz0,z1,z2asα(ξ)=α0(1−ξ)2+z0α2+z2α0z12(1−ξ)ξ+α2ξ2,β(ξ)=(α0β1−z0)z1z0α2+z2α0(1−ξ)2+β12(1−ξ)ξ+(α2β1+z2)z1z0α2+z2α0ξ2.Considerable simplification is achieved by considering canonical-form curves, with(α0,β0)=(1,0). Since canonical form is achieved by a scaling/rotation, that mapsr′(0)to the unit vector i, it does not alter the PH or DPH nature of a curve, or the existence of rational rotation-minimizing frames on it (Farouki, 2010).Settingα0=1andβ1=z0gives the canonical-form polynomials(35)α(ξ)=(1−ξ)2+z0α2+z2z12(1−ξ)ξ+α2ξ2,β(ξ)=z02(1−ξ)ξ+z1ξ2.These polynomials define a monotone or general helical DPH quintic, when(z0,z1,z2)are of the form(12w02,w0w1,12w12)orei2ζ(12h0,h1,12h2).Now suppose that condition (25) is satisfied with quadratic polynomialsa(ξ),b(ξ). Combining them into a complex polynomialc(ξ)=a(ξ)+ib(ξ)with Bernstein coefficientsc0,c1,c2, we see that the right-hand side of (25) is equal toIm(c¯c′)/|c|2. Since this expression is unchanged on dividingc(ξ)by any complex constant, we may choosec0=1without loss of generality.Withc0=1, ifγ0,γ1,γ2are the Bernstein coefficients ofγ(ξ), satisfaction of (25) means that for some real numberℓ≠0we must have(36)γ0=2ℓIm(c1),γ1=ℓIm(c2),γ2=2ℓIm(c¯1c2),|α0|2+|β0|2=ℓ,Re(α0α¯1+β0β¯1)=ℓRe(c¯1),Re(α¯0α2+β¯0β2)+2(|α1|2+|β1|2)=ℓ(Re(c¯2)+2|c1|2),Re(α1α¯2+β1β¯2)=ℓRe(c1c¯2),(37)|α2|2+|β2|2=ℓ|c2|2.For the DPH quintic specified by (35) with(z0,z1,z2)=(12w02,w0w1,12w12)and(γ0,γ1,γ2)=(|w0|2,Re(w0w¯1),|w1|2), we obtainℓ=1from the first equation in (37). Eqs. (36) and the other equations in (37) are then|w0|2=2Im(c1),Re(w¯0w1)=Im(c2),|w1|2=2Im(c¯1c2),Re(α¯1)=Re(c¯1),Re(α2)+2|α1|2+12|w0|4=Re(c¯2)+2|c1|2,Re(α1α¯2+12|w0|2w0w¯1)=Re(c1c¯2),|α2|2+|w0|2|w1|2=|c2|2,whereα1=12(w1/w0)+12(w0/w1)α2,α2is free, andβ1=12w02,β2=w0w1. Settingc1=a1+ib1,c2=a2+ib2,w0=w0eiϕ0,w1=w1eiϕ1,α2=u2+iv2,c=cos(ϕ1−ϕ0),s=sin(ϕ1−ϕ0)then gives(38)w02=2b1,w0w1c=b2,w12=2(a1b2−a2b1),w0w1(cu2+sv2)+w1w0c=2a1,4c(cu2+sv2)+w02w12(u22+v22)+w12w02+w04=2a2+4(a12+b12),w1w0(cu2+sv2)+w0w1c(u22+v22)+w03w1c=2(a1a2+b1b2),(39)u22+v22+w02w12=a22+b22.Lemma 2The solutions to(38)–(39)generate straight lines ifb1=0, and planar curves ifv2=0andϕ1=ϕ0+kπfor integer k, i.e.,(c,s)=(±1,0).ProofIfb1=0, Eqs. (38) imply thatw0=w1=0, and thusw(ξ)≡0. Consequently, from (29) we haveα(ξ)β′(ξ)−α′(ξ)β(ξ)≡0, and since the curvature ofr(ξ)can be expressed (Farouki et al., 2009b) asκ(ξ)=2|α(ξ)β′(ξ)−α′(ξ)β(ξ)|(|α(ξ)|2+|β(ξ)|2)2,this implies thatκ(ξ)≡0— i.e., the curve degenerates to a straight line. Ifϕ1=ϕ0+kπandv2=0(i.e.,α2is real), we have(α0,α1,α2)=(1,±12[(w1/w0)+(w0/w1)u2],u2),(β0,β1,β2)=ei2ϕ0(0,12w02,±w0w1),andα(ξ),β(ξ)are thus of the form stated in Lemma 1 for a planar curve.  □Proposition 4Monotone helical DPH quintics admit rational RMOFs only in the degenerate cases of straight lines or planar curves.ProofFor Eqs. (38) to define realw0,w1values we must haveb1>0anda1b2−a2b1⩾0, where we invoke Lemma 2 to discount the caseb1=0. Moreover, consistency of these equations implies that(40)c2=b224(a1b2−a2b1)b1,and hence we must also have4(a1b2−a2b1)b1⩾b22. Assuming these conditions hold, substituting (38) and (40) into (39) gives4b1b2c(cu2+sv2)+b2b1=4a1,4c(cu2+sv2)+b1a1b2−a2b1(u22+v22)+a1b2−a2b1b1=2a2+4a12,4a1b2−a2b1b2c(cu2+sv2)+b2a1b2−a2b1(u22+v22)=4a1a2,u22+v22+4(a1b2−a2b1)b1=a22+b22.From the first and fourth of these equations we obtain(41)c(cu2+sv2)=b2b1(a1−b24b1),u22+v22=a22+b22−4(a1b2−a2b1)b1,and thus, to ensure thatα2=u2+iv2exists, we have the further inequalitya22+b22⩾4(a1b2−a2b1)b1. On substituting (41) into the second and third equations, we arrive at two conditions involving onlya1,b1,a2,b2— namely(42)[a12+b12a1b2−a2b1−1b1][b22b1−4(a1b2−a2b1)]=0,(43)[a1a2+b1b2a1b2−a2b1−a1b1][b22b1−4(a1b2−a2b1)]=0.Consider first the case where the common second factor in (42)–(43) vanishes. Then(c,s)=(±1,0)from (40), and Eqs. (41) reduce tou2=b2b1(a1−b24b1),u22+v22=a22.Substituting the former into the latter givesv22=[b22−4(a1b2−a2b1)b1][4(a1b2+a2b1)b1−b22]16b14,and sinceb22−4(a1b2−a2b1)b1=0, we obtainv2=0. The conditionsv2=0and(c,s)=(±1,0)of Lemma 2 for a planar curve are thus satisfied.Now consider that case where the first factors in Eqs. (42)–(43) vanish simultaneously. This occurs (provided thata12⩾a2) when(44)b1=±a12−a2andb2=±2a1a12−a2.From (40) we then havec2=a12/(2a12−a2), and using this together withs2=1−c2in (41) givesv22=a12(2a12−a2−u2)2/(a12−a2). Substituting into the second equation of (41) and simplifying yields the quadratic equationu22−2a12u2+4a14−6a12a2+3a22=0inu2. Since this has discriminant−12(a12−a2)2, there are no real solutions foru2unlessa12=a2, in which case we haveb1=0from (44) and Lemma 2 implies that the curve degenerates into a straight line.  □For a DPH quintic specified by (35) with(z0,z1,z2)=(12h0ei2ζ,h1ei2ζ,12h2ei2ζ)and(γ0,γ1,γ2)=(h0,h1,h2), we haveℓ=1again from the first equation in (37), so (36) and the other equations in (37) becomeh0=2Im(c1),h1=Im(c2),h2=2Im(c¯1c2),Re(α¯1)=Re(c¯1),Re(α2)+2(|α1|2+|β1|2)=Re(c¯2)+2|c1|2,Re(α1α¯2+β1β¯2)=Re(c1c¯2),|α2|2+|β2|2=|c2|2,withα1=12(h0α2+h2)/h1,α2free, andβ1=12h0ei2ζ,β2=h1ei2ζ. Settingc1=a1+ib1,c2=a2+ib2,α2=u2+iv2then gives(45)h0=2b1,h1=b2,h2=2(a1b2−a2b1),h0u2+h2=2h1a1,2(h12+h0h2)u2+h02(u22+v22)+h02h12+h22=2h12[a2+2(a12+b12)],h0(u22+v22)+h2u2+h0h12=2h1(a1a2+b1b2),(46)u22+v22+h12=a22+b22.Proposition 5General helical DPH quintics admit rational RMOFs only in the degenerate case of planar curves.ProofSubstituting (45) into (46) and simplifying givesu2=a2,(b22+4(a1b2−a2b1)b1)u2+2b12(u22+v22)=4a1a2b1b2+a2b22−2a22b12,b1(u22+v22)+(a1b2−a2b1)u2=a1a2b2,u22+v22=a22.From the first and fourth equations we have(u2,v2)=(a2,0)and these values also satisfy the other equations. Hence,α2=u2andα1=12(h0u2+h2)/h1, andα(ξ),β(ξ)have the form identified in Lemma 1 with planar curves, since(α0,α1,α2)=(1,12(h0u2+h2)/h1,u2)and(β0,β1,β2)=ei2ψ(0,12h0,h1).  □Surfaces generated by the motion of a straight line through space are called ruled surfaces. Each instance of the line is a ruling or generator of the surface. A special class of ruled surfaces, the developable surfaces, is characterized by a constant surface normal along each ruling. A surface is developable if and only if it is the envelope of a one-parameter family of planes. A developable surface, regarded as a thin material sheet, can be “flattened” (or developed) onto a plane, without stretching or compressing it (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, 1952; Kreyszig, 1959; Struik, 1961).Several important ruled surfaces are associated with a space curve. The surface generated by the curve tangent lines is a developable surface, known as the tangent developable — it can also be interpreted as the envelope of the curve osculating planes. However, for space curves, the surfaces generated by lines along the principal normal and binormal directions at each point are not developable (Kreyszig, 1959). The envelopes of the normal planes and the rectifying planes to a space curve are called the polar developable and rectifying developable.If the tangent developable is developed onto a plane, the space curve maps to a plane curve, the generators of the surface becoming its tangents. The two curves have equal curvatures at corresponding points, and equal arc lengths of corresponding segments (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, 1952). When the rectifying developable is developed onto a plane, the curve maps to a straight line, corresponding segments of the curve and the line having equal lengths. The polar developable can be regarded as the analog, for a space curve, of the evolute of a plane curve (Struik, 1961).Consider the construction of a ruled surface from a space curver(ξ), such that the surface tangent plane is coincident with the curve osculating plane. Expressing the surface in terms of a unit vectord(ξ)defined alongr(ξ)as(47)s(ξ,λ)=r(ξ)+λd(ξ),it has the desired property ifd(ξ)is of the form(48)d(ξ)=cosΘ(ξ)t(ξ)+sinΘ(ξ)p(ξ)since we than havesξ×sλ=sinΘσb+λ[sinΘστ(cosΘp−sinΘt)−(Θ′+σκ)b],and thus whenλ=0— i.e., along the curver(ξ)— the surface normal is(49)n=sξ×sλ|sξ×sλ|=−sign(sinΘ)b.Coincidence of the osculating plane ofr(ξ)with the tangent plane ofs(ξ,λ)identifies the curve as an asymptotic line of the surface (47).The tangent developable and the principal normal surface correspond to choosingt(ξ)andp(ξ)ford(ξ). The angular velocity describing the changing orientation of the rulings in these cases is the Darboux vector,ω=κb+τt. However, the componentκbof this angular velocity defines an orientational change within the osculating plane, that is “unnecessary” to satisfaction of the constraints imposed ons(ξ,λ). A ruled surface satisfying the prescribed interpolation conditions, with the least orientational variation of its rulings, can be constructed by choosing one of the RMOF vectorsf(ξ),g(ξ)defined by (10)–(11) — or any vector fixed relative to them — ford(ξ).The family of tangent lines to a curver(ξ)define the ruled surface(50)s(ξ,λ)=r(ξ)+λt(ξ),with derivativessξ=σ(t+λκp)andsλ=tsatisfyingsξ×sλ=−σλκb. Thus, ifr(ξ)is regular with non-vanishing curvature, the surface normal isn=sξ×sλ|sξ×sλ|=−sign(λ)b.This is the singular caseΘ(ξ)≡0of (49). The tangent developable consists of two “sheets” corresponding toλ<0andλ>0that meet atλ=0, i.e., along the curver(ξ), where n is indeterminate (it is also indeterminate along rulings corresponding to points at whichκ=0— i.e., the inflections ofr(ξ)). Since n exhibits a sudden reversal on passing throughλ=0along a ruling of the surface (50), the curver(ξ)is called (Kreyszig, 1959) the cuspidal edge or edge of regression of the tangent surfaces(ξ,λ). It may also be regarded as the locus of intersection points of neighboring generators, at parameter values ξ andξ+δξ, asδξ→0. Since n is independent of λ (except atλ=0), each sheet of the surface (50) is developable, and can be generated by folding a piece of paper. In applications, one considers portions of the surface (50) withλ<0orλ>0, to avoid inclusion of the singular locus defined byλ=0.The principal normal surface has rulings along the principal normal vectors to the curver(ξ), and thus has the parameterization(51)s(ξ,λ)=r(ξ)+λp(ξ).Sincesξ=σ[(1−λκ)t+λτb]andsλ=p, the surface normal isn=sξ×sλ|sξ×sλ|=(1−λκ)b−λτt(1−λκ)2+(λτ)2=b−λω|b−λω|,whereωis the Darboux vector defined by (5). Note that n is non-singular atλ=0. Since n depends explicitly on λ, the surface (51) is not developable.If the curve has vanishing torsion atξ=ξ⁎, the surface normal becomes singular at the pointλ=1/κ(ξ⁎)of the corresponding ruling — this identifies the center of curvature for the curve pointr(ξ⁎). If the curvature is finite, the surface normal n is non-singular at each point of the curver(ξ).On non-developable ruled surfaces, neighboring generators at parameter values ξ andξ+δξdo not intersect asδξ→0, so there is no edge of regression. Instead, closest points on neighboring generators asδξ→0define a locus called the line of striction. For the surface (47), it is defined (Pottmann and Wallner, 2001; Struik, 1961) by(52)q(ξ)=r(ξ)−r′(ξ)⋅d′(ξ)|d′(ξ)|2d(ξ).For the tangent surface, choosing the tangentt(ξ)ford(ξ)givesq(ξ)=r(ξ)— i.e., the line of striction is the edge of regression. However, for the principal normal surface, choosingp(ξ)ford(ξ)gives the line of strictionq(ξ)=r(ξ)+κ(ξ)κ2(ξ)+τ2(ξ)p(ξ).The pitch of a non-developable ruled surface is a measure of the variation of the surface tangent plane along each ruling. If δθ and δh are the angle and distance between rulings at ξ andξ+δξ, the pitchp(ξ)is (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, 1952) the limit of the ratioδθ/δh, asδξ→0. For the surface (47), it is specified (Pottmann and Wallner, 2001) by(53)p(ξ)=|d′(ξ)|2r′(ξ)⋅[d(ξ)×d′(ξ)].One can verify that, for the principal normal surface,p=(κ2+τ2)/τ.For the tangent surface (50) and principal normal surface (51), the angular velocityωof the rulings is defined by the Darboux vector (5), in which the termκbspecifies an “unnecessary” rotation in the osculating plane — i.e., it is not required for the tangent plane ofs(ξ,λ)to be coincident with the osculating plane ofr(ξ)at each point. A rotation-minimizing ruled surface, interpolating a given curve and its osculating planes, can be defined by using one of the basis vectors (10)–(11) to specify the rulings, so as to eliminate the termκbin the Darboux vector. For example, the rulings of the surface(54)s(ξ,λ)=r(ξ)+λf(ξ),have the angular velocity (12). The surface derivatives aresξ=σt+λf′andsλ=f, wheref=cosθt+sinθpandf′=στsinθb. Hence, we havesξ×sλ=σsinθ(b+λτf), and the unit surface normal is defined by(55)n=sξ×sλ|sξ×sλ|=sign(sinθ)b+λτg1+λ2τ2.Because the surface normal varies with λ, the surface (54) is not developable.The surface normal (55) is singular along each ruling at a parameter value ξ for which the angle (11) is an integer multiple of π — i.e., at points where the ruling direction f is parallel or anti-parallel to the tangent. Since the curvature is non-negative, the angle (11) is monotone-increasing with ξ, and such singular rulings occur at points onr(ξ)determined by its curvature. In practice, one would restrict the surface (54) to intervals between such points: the integration constantθ0in (11) can be used to adjust such intervals.Proposition 6The line of striction on the ruled surface(54)coincides with the curver(ξ), as for the tangent surface. The pitch of this surface is equal to the torsion of the curver(ξ), and is the smallest possible for the ruled surfaces defined by(47)–(48), whose tangent planes coincide with the osculating plane ofr(ξ). These results also hold if the frame vectorfis replaced bygin(54).ProofChoosingd(ξ)=f(ξ)in (52), and recalling thatf′=στsinθb, we obtainr′⋅f′=σ2τsinθt⋅b=0, and henceq(ξ)=r(ξ). Similarly, withd(ξ)=f(ξ)in (53), we have|f′|2=σ2τ2sin2θ, andr′⋅(f×f′)=σt⋅[(cosθt+sinθp)×στsinθb]=σ2τsin2θ,and hencep=τ. Moreover, substituting (48) into (53) and simplifying givesp=τ+(Θ′+σκ)2σ2τsin2Θ.This expression is of least magnitude whenΘ′=−σκ, i.e.,Θ(ξ)coincides with the angleθ(ξ)specified by (11), identifying the RMOF vectorf(ξ).  □Example 2Fig. 3illustrates the three types of ruled surfaces discussed above, in the case where the curver(ξ)is a segment of the circular helix (13). For all three ruled surfaces, the tangent plane coincides with the osculating plane along the helix, but the rotation-minimizing ruled surface exhibits the least possible angular velocity of its rulings consistent with this constraint.Remark 5The pitch provides a convenient way of piecing together portions of two non-developable ruled surfaces, withG1continuity (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen, 1952). A generator is chosen from each surface, having equal pitch values. Then, if these generators are placed in coincidence, such that the points of striction are coincident, and the surface tangent planes are in agreement at this point, the two surfaces will possess a common tangent plane along the common generator. The rotation-minimizing ruled surfaces (54) are particularly amenable to this construction, because of the simple nature of their pitch and lines of striction.Example 3Consider the composite curve that consists of (i) the PH cubicr(ξ)in Section 3.3 withp0=(0,0,0),L0=L2=2,ϑ=12π, andφ=32πforξ∈[0,12]; and (ii) the circular helixs(ϕ)=Δp+f(−cosϕ,−sinϕ,ϕ)withΔp=(17,1,2(4−34π))/8andf=32/8forϕ∈[14π,34π]. These curves have a common end-pointr(12)=s(14π)=14(7,−1,22)and a coincident tangentt=12(1,−1,2), curvatureκ=22/3, and torsionτ=22/3at this point, but the principal normal and binormal ofs(ϕ)have opposite sense to those ofr(ξ). For this composite curve, Fig. 4compares the principal normal surface, which is onlyG0along the common ruling, and the rotation-minimizing ruled surface, which isG1along the common ruling.The variation of the Frenet frame, comprising the tangent t, principal normal p, and binormal b, characterizes the local geometry of a space curve. The Frenet frame is rotation-minimizing with respect to p — i.e., t and b have no rotation about p. Rotation-minimizing adapted frames, characterized by normal-plane vectors u and v with no rotation about t, are also well-known. The focus of this study has been on rotation-minimizing osculating frames, incorporating osculating-plane vectors f and g that have no rotation about the binormal b. The vectors f, g can be defined by rotating t, p through an angle equal to minus the integral of the curvature with respect to arc length.A comprehensive study of the existence of rational RMOFs on low-degree polynomial space curves indicates no cubic or quintic double PH curves with this property. The existence of rational RMOFs on degree 7 or higher-order curves remains an open problem. The use of RMOFs for the construction of a novel type of ruled surface, interpolating a space curve with tangent planes that are coincident with the osculating planes along the curve, and minimal rotation of the rulings under this constraint, was also investigated.
