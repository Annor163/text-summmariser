@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The performance of two curved beam finite element models based on coupled polynomial displacement fields is investigated for out-of-plane vibration of arches. These two-noded beam models employ curvilinear strain definitions and have three degrees of freedom per node namely, out-of-plane translation (v), out-of-plane bending rotation (θz) and torsion rotation (θs). The coupled polynomial interpolation fields are derived independently for Timoshenko and Euler–Bernoulli beam elements using the force-moment equilibrium equations. Numerical performance of these elements for constrained and unconstrained arches is compared with the conventional curved beam models which are based on independent polynomial fields. The formulation is shown to be free from any spurious constraints in the limit of ‘flexureless torsion’ and ‘torsionless flexure’ and hence devoid of flexure and torsion locking. The resulting stiffness and consistent mass matrices generated from the coupled displacement models show excellent convergence of natural frequencies in locking regimes. The accuracy of the shear flexibility added to the elements is also demonstrated. The coupled polynomial models are shown to perform consistently over a wide range of flexure-to-shear (EI/GA) and flexure-to-torsion (EI/GJ) stiffness ratios and are inherently devoid of flexure, torsion and shear locking phenomena.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The out-of-plane free vibration of curved beams exhibit coupled flexure and torsion behavior. The presence of the shear, flexure and torsion locking phenomena in the out-of-plane deformation of conventional curved beam finite element models [1,2] significantly influence their dynamic behavior. The conventional curved Timoshenko beam finite element model exhibit flexure and torsion locking in addition to shear locking, whereas Euler–Bernoulli beam model exhibit only torsion locking [2]. The severity of the flexure and torsion locking phenomena was shown to depend on the magnitude of flexure-to-torsion (EI/GJ) stiffness ratio. It was demonstrated that, the use of inconsistent torsion strain models produces spurious torsion strain energy and fail to simulate accurately the ‘torsionless flexure’ behavior when GJ⪢EI, leading to torsion locking. Similarly, the use of inconsistent flexure strain models produce spurious flexure strain energy and fail to simulate accurately the ‘flexureless torsion’ behavior when EI⪢GJ, leading to flexure locking.Major research on the out-of-plane vibration analysis of curved beams mainly focused on developing models to accurately represent the dynamic characteristics [3–15]. Other studies focused on understanding the effect of shear deformation and rotary inertia on the frequency and mode shapes of thick and thin beams under constrained and unconstrained end conditions [16–19]. Recently, the authors [1,2], investigated flexure and torsion locking phenomena in out-of-plane deformation of Timoshenko and Euler–Bernoulli curved beams. Improved curved beam finite elements based on coupled displacement field methodology were proposed to alleviate these locking effects and to enhance the convergence rate. In the above papers, the authors have evaluated/examined performance of these proposed elements in the context of static analysis. However, the use of coupled shape functions derived based on the static equilibrium consideration, for computation of consistent element mass matrix for dynamic analysis is questionable and the performance of such a finite element is not obvious. The focus of the current paper is to verify and validate the applicability of the above coupled shape functions to dynamic analysis. The important aspect of the shape functions is that their coefficients are coupled, which however, do not introduce/produce any spurious modes even in the extreme limits of stiffness ratios. The efficacy of the consistent mass matrix is examined and ascertained in predicting the natural frequencies of curved arches under different boundary conditions. Also, the performance of the coupled models is compared with the conventional finite element models which are based on independent field interpolations. Further, the applicability and performance is verified in the shear, flexure and torsion locking regimes.This article is organized as follows: In Section 2, the geometry and coordinate systems for a curved beam element are described and the finite element formulation based on Hamilton׳s principle is presented. In Section 3, the independent polynomial fields for conventional models are presented and the constraints are examined in the context of flexure and torsion locking. In Section 4, the displacement fields for coupled polynomial models are presented and the role of the coupled terms in eliminating locking is examined in detail. In Section 5, numerical studies are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the coupled models in predicting natural frequencies of curved beam structures under different end constraints. These models exhibit consistent performance over a wide range of flexure-to-shear (EI/GA) and flexure-to-torsion (EI/GJ) stiffness ratios and are inherently devoid of shear, flexure and torsion locking phenomena. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.The geometry and coordinate system for a curved beam element of length 2L and radius of curvature R is shown inFig. 1. A right-handed orthogonal curvilinear co-ordinate system s-y–z is used with its origin placed at the center of the element. The natural coordinate ξ along the circumferential direction is expressed asξ=s/L.The out-of-plane flexure, shear and torsion strain components in the curvilinear co-ordinate system are(1)κ=−θz′+θsR(2)γ=v′−θz(3)τ=θs′+θzRIn the above equations, v is the transverse out-of-plane displacement, θzis the flexure rotation and θsis the torsional rotation of the cross-section. The prime (′) indicates the derivative with respect to the circumferential coordinate s.The strain energy stored in the element is the sum of energies due to shear, flexure and torsion deformation and is written as(4)Ue(v,θz,θs)=12∫−LL[kGA(v′−θz)2+EIz(−θz′+θsR)2+GJ(θs′+θzR)2]dsThe terms in the square bracket represent the strain energy due to transverse shear deformation, bending and torsion respectively; E and G denote Young׳s modulus and shear modulus, respectively, k is the shear correction factor; and R is the radius of curvature of the beam element. The geometric parameters A, Izand J denote the area, moment of inertia, and torsional constant for the cross-section, respectively.The kinetic energy stored in the element consists of kinetic energy due to translation motion and rotary inertia due to bending and torsion is expressed as(5)Te(v,θz,θs)=12∫−LL[ρAv̇2+ρIzθ̇z2+ρIsθ̇s2]dsNeglecting the work done by applied forces, the equation of motion is obtained by applying Hamilton׳s principle [20] as(6)0=∫t1t2δ(T−U)dtPerforming integration by parts we obtain the equation of motion as(7)Mq¨+Kq=0whereq={vθzθs}T.Assuming polynomial expressions for the field variables v, θzand θsas(8)v=∑i=1lviϕi,θz=∑i=1mθziψi,θs=∑i=1nθsiχiand substituting in Eq. (7) we obtain the expressions for stiffness ‘K’ and mass ‘M’ asKij11=∫−LL[GAksdϕidsdϕjds]ds,Kij12=−∫−LL[GAksdϕidsψj]ds=Kji21Kij22=∫−LL[GAksψjψi+GJψjRψiR+EIdψidsdψids]dsKij23=∫−LL[GJψjRdχids+EIdψidsχiR]ds=Kji32,Kij33=∫−LL[GJdχjdsdχids−EIχjRχiR]ds,Kij13=Kji31=0Mij11=∫−LL[ρAϕjϕi]ds,Mij22=∫−LL[ρIzψjψi]ds,Mij33=∫−LL[ρIsχjχi]dsThe elemental Eq. (7) are assembled to obtain global equations of motion. These second order ordinary differential equations are converted into an Eigenvalue problem by assuming harmonic motion as(9)[K−ω2M]q=0where ω are the eigenvalues and q are eigenvectors.The accuracy and convergence characteristic of an element depends on the choice of the polynomial assumed for the field variables. Therefore, the selection of a proper displacement field for the element is of utmost important. In the following sections, for a two-noded curved beam element, the displacement fields for independent polynomial models and coupled polynomial models are examined for their effectiveness in flexure and torsion locking regimes.In general, the conventional beam models assume independent polynomial approximation for the field variables. The order of polynomial depends on the accuracy and convergence requirement of the solution. Here we examine the consistency of the displacement field used in conventional Euler–Bernoulli (designated as EB) and Timoshenko (designated as TIMO) models in the flexure and torsion locking regimes.The conventional out-of-plane Euler–Bernoulli beam element makes use of cubic interpolation for transverse displacement v, quadratic interpolation for flexure rotationθz=dv/dsand linear interpolation for torsion rotationθsas given below:(10)v=a3ξ3+a2ξ2+a1ξ+a0,θz=3a3Lξ2+2a2Lξ+a1L,θs=a4ξ+a5The consistency of this choice of displacement fields in the flexure and torsion locking regime in exhibiting the true behavior of flexureless-torsion and torsionless-flexure in the physical limits of stiffness ratios are examined next.In the regime EI/GJ⪢1 flexure locking is significant [2], and for the element to be free of this locking, the flexure strain energy should tend to vanish in this stiffness ratio regime. This condition of vanishing flexure strain energy can be examined by expressing the flexure strain field in terms of Legendre polynomial coefficients. Substituting for θsand θzfrom Eq. (10) and expressing the flexure strain of Eq. (1), we get(11)κ=(2a2L2+a5R)+(−6a3L2+a4R)ξDue to orthogonal property of Legendre polynomials and independent nature of the generalized coefficients, the condition of flexureless-torsion is satisfied if and only if the coefficients of the above equations independently tend to zero, leading to the following constraints:(12.1)2a2L2+a5R→0(12.2)−6a3L2+a4R→0The above constraints are true constraints as they have contributions from all the participating displacement fields. Hence the Euler–Bernoulli (EB) model does not produce any spurious constraints and does not exhibit flexure locking.In the regime EI/GJ⪡1, torsion locking is significant [2], and for the element to be free of this locking, the torsion strain energy should tend to vanish in this stiffness ratio regime. This condition of vanishing torsion strain energy can be examined by expressing the torsion strain field in terms of Legendre polynomial coefficients. Substituting for θsand θzfrom Eq. (10) and expressing the torsion strain of Eq. (2), we get(13)τ=(a4L+a1LR+a3LR)+(2a2LR)ξ+(a3LR)(3ξ2−1)Due to orthogonal property of Legendre polynomials and independent nature of the generalized coefficients, the condition of torsionless-flexure is satisfied if and only if the coefficients of the above equation independently tend to zero, leading to the following constraints:(14.1)a4L+a1LR+a3LR→0(14.2)a2LR→0(14.3)a3LR→0The constraints corresponding to Eq. (14.1) is a true constraint as it has contributions from all the participating displacement fields. Eqs. (14.2) and (14.3) are spurious constraints which are responsible for torsion locking.The conventional out-of-plane Timoshenko beam element makes use of linear interpolation for transverse displacement v, flexure rotationθzand torsion rotationθsas given below:(15)v=a0+a1ξ;θs=a2+a3ξ;θz=a4+a5ξThe consistency of this choice of displacement fields in the flexure and torsion locking regime in exhibiting the true physical behavior of flexureless-torsion and torsionless-flexure respectively are examined in this section.In the regime EI/GJ⪢1 flexure locking is significant [2], and for the element to be free of this locking, the flexure strain energy should tend to vanish in this stiffness ratio regime. This condition of vanishing flexure strain energy can be examined by expressing the flexure strain field in terms of Legendre polynomial coefficients. Substituting for θsand θzfrom Eq. (10) and expressing the flexure strain of Eq. (1), we get(16)κ=(−a5L+a2R)+(a3R)ξDue to orthogonal property of Legendre polynomials and independent nature of the generalized coefficients, the condition of flexureless-torsion is satisfied if and only if the coefficients of the above equation independently tend to zero, leading to the following constraints:(17.1)a2R−a5L→0(17.2)a3R→0The constraints corresponding to Eq. (17.1) is the true constraint as it has contributions from all the participating displacement fields and this combination can enforce this condition. Eq. (17.2) is the spurious constraint and is responsible for flexure locking.In the regime EI/GJ⪡1 torsion locking is significant [2], and for the element to be free of this locking, the torsion strain energy should tend to vanish in this stiffness ratio regime. This condition of vanishing torsion strain energy can be examined by expressing the torsion strain field in terms of Legendre polynomial coefficients. Substituting for θsand θzfrom Eq. (10) and expressing the torsion strain of Eq. (2), we get(18)τ=(a4R+a3L)+(a5R)ξDue to orthogonal property of Legendre polynomials and independent nature of the generalized coefficients, the condition of torsionless-flexure is satisfied if and only if the coefficients of the above equation independently tend to zero, leading to the following constraints:(19.1)a4R+a3L→0(19.2)a5R→0The constraints corresponding to Eq. (19.1) is the true constraint as it has contributions from all the participating displacement fields and this combination can enforce this condition. Eq. (19.2) is the spurious constraint which is responsible for torsion locking. Hence this choice of interpolation for the field variables produces flexure and torsion locking in the Timoshenko beam element.Here we examine the consistency of the displacement field used in coupled Euler–Bernoulli model (designated as EB-CP) and coupled Timoshenko model (designated as TIMO-CP) in the flexure and torsion locking regimes.The coupled out-of-plane Euler–Bernoulli beam element makes use of the following interpolations for the field variables as [2](20.1)θz=a3ξ2+a2ξ+a1(20.2)θs=α1L(a3ξ33+a2ξ22)+a4ξ+a5(20.3)v=−β12a3Lξ+β2L(a3ξ33+a2ξ22+a1ξ)+β3L(α1(a3ξ33+a2ξ22)+a4ξ)+a3ξ33+a2ξ22+a1ξ+a0whereα1=−GJR(EI+GJ),β1=EIKGA,β2=GJKGAR2,β3=EI+GJKGARThe shear strain is obtained as(21)γ=v′−θz=−β1θz″+β2θz+β3θs′(22)γ=−β12a3L2+β2(a3ξ2+a2ξ+a1)+β3(α1(a3ξ2+a2ξ)+a4L)Eq. (22) represents the shear strain distribution and it is a measure of shear flexibility present in the coupled Euler–Bernoulli curved beam model. For a straight beam configuration, R→∞,β2,β3→0and the shear flexibility reduces to−β1θz″. In the thin limits of EI⪡GA and GJ⪡GA,β1,β2,β3→0and the shear strain vanishes for both curved and straight beams.The consistency of this choice of displacement fields in the shear and torsion locking regime in exhibiting the true behavior of shearless-flexure and torsionless-flexure in the physical limits of stiffness ratios are examined next.In the regime EI/GJ⪡1 torsion locking is significant [2], and for the element to be free of this locking, the torsion strain energy should tend to vanish in this stiffness ratio regime. This condition of vanishing torsion strain energy can be examined by expressing the torsion strain field in terms of Legendre polynomial coefficients. Substituting for θsand θzfrom Eqs. (20.1) and (20.2) torsion strain of Eq. (2) can be expressed as(23)τ=(a4L+a1R+(α1+1R)a33)+((α1+1R)a2)ξ+((α1+1R)a33)(3ξ2−1)Due to the independent nature of the generalized coefficients, the condition of torsionless-flexure is satisfied if and only if the coefficients of Legendre polynomials independently tend to zero, leading to the following constraints:(24.1)a4L+a1R+(α1+1R)a33→0(24.2)(α1+1R)a2→0(24.3)(α1+1R)a33→0All the above constraints are true constraints. Eq. (24.1) has contributions from different fields and this combination can enforce this condition. Eqs. (24.2) and (24.3) are explicitly satisfied when EI⪡GJ, asα1→−1R. Hence the coupled displacement fields for EB-CP model does not produce any spurious constraints in the torsion locking regime and exhibit torsionless-flexure behavior.In thin regimes (EI⪡GA), shear locking is significant, and for the element to be free of this locking the shear strain energy should tend to vanish in this regime. This condition of vanishing shear strain energy can be examined by expressing the shear strain field in terms of Legendre polynomial coefficients we get(25)γ=(−β12a3L2+β2a1+β3a4L+β2a3+β3α1a3)+(β2a2+β3α1a2)ξ+(β2a3+β3α1a3)(3ξ2−1)Due to orthogonal property of Legendre polynomials and independent nature of the generalized coefficients, the condition of shearless-flexure is satisfied if and only if the coefficients of the above equation independently tend to zero, leading to the following constraints:(26.1)(−β12L2+β2+β3α1)a3+β2a1+β3a4L→0(26.2)(β2+β3α1)a2→0(26.3)(β2+β3α1)a3→0All the above constraints are true constraints. Eq. (26.1) has contributions from participating displacement fields and this combination can enforce this condition. Eqs. (26.2) and (26.3) are explicitly satisfied with the combination of(β2+β3α1). Hence the coupled Euler–Bernoulli (EB) beam model do not produce any spurious constraints in the shear locking regime and exhibit shearless-flexure behavior.The coupled out-of-plane Timoshenko beam element makes use of the following interpolations for the field variables as(27.1)θz=α2La1ξ22+a3ξ+a4(27.2)θs=α1La3ξ22+a1ξ+a2(27.3)v=α2L2a1ξ36+a3Lξ22+(a4L+a5)ξ+a6The shear strain in the TIMO-CP model is obtained by substituting the coupled polynomial interpolations forθzand v from Eqs. (27.1) and (27.3), in the shear strain definition of Eq. (2) as(28)γ=a5LEq. (28) represents a constant shear strain distribution over an element and is a measure of shear flexibility present in the TIMO-CP model. The generalized degree of freedom a5present in the shear strain do not participate in any other strain field. Being an independent degree of freedom it can assume suitable values to make the shear strain insignificant in the thin regime and significant in the thick regime, for representing the true physical behavior. This adaptability of the generalized degree of freedom a5 in thin and thick regimes is validated later through numerical example.The consistency of this choice of displacement fields in the shear, flexure and torsion locking regime in exhibiting the true behavior of shearless-flexure, flexureless-torsion and torsionless-flexure in the physical limits of stiffness ratios are examined next.In the regime EI/GJ⪢1 flexure locking is significant [2], and for the element to be free of this locking, the flexure strain energy should tend to vanish to exhibit the flexureless-torsion behavior. This condition of vanishing flexure strain energy can be examined by expressing the flexure strain field in terms of Legendre polynomial coefficients. Substituting for θsand θzin flexure strain of Eq. (1) we get(29)κ=(−a3L+a2R+α1La36R−α1α2La36)+((1R−α2)a1)ξ+(α1La36R−α1α2La36)(3ξ2−1)Due to the independent nature of the generalized coefficients, the condition of flexureless-torsion is satisfied if and only if the coefficients of Legendre polynomials independently tend to zero, leading to the following constraints:(30.1)a2R+a3(−1L+α1L6R−α1α2L6)→0(30.2)(1R−α2)a1→0(30.3)(α1L6R−α1α2L6)a3→0All the above constraints are true constraints. Eq. (30.1) has contributions from different fields and this combination can enforce this condition. Eqs. (30.2) and (30.3) are explicitly satisfied when EI⪢GJ, asα1→0,α2→1R. Hence the coupled displacement fields for TIMO-CP model do not produce any spurious constraints in the flexure locking regime and exhibit flexureless-torsion behavior.In the regime EI/GJ⪡1 torsion locking is significant [2], and for the element to be free of this locking, the torsion strain energy should tend to vanish to exhibit the torsionless-flexure behavior. This condition of vanishing torsion strain energy can be examined by expressing the torsion strain field in terms of Legendre polynomial coefficients. Substituting the polynomial displacement representation for θsand θzin torsion strain of Eq. (3) we get(31)τ=(a1L+a4R+α2La16R)+((1R+α1+α1α2L2a110R)a3)ξ+(α2La16R)(3ξ2−1)+(α1α2L2a330R)(5ξ3−3ξ)Due to the independent nature of the generalized coefficients, the condition of torsionless-flexure is satisfied if and only if the coefficients of Legendre polynomials independently tend to zero, leading to the following constraints:(32.1)a1L+a4R+α2La16R→0(32.2)(1R+α1+α1α2L2a110R)a3→0(32.3)α2La16R→0(32.4)α1α2L2a330R→0All the above constraints are true constraints. Eq. (32.1) has contributions from different fields and this combination can enforce this condition. Eqs. (32.2)–(32.4) are explicitly satisfied when EI⪡GJ, asα1→−1R,α2→0. Hence the coupled displacement fields for TIMO-CP model does not produce any spurious constraints in the torsion locking regime and exhibit torsionless-flexure behavior.In thin regimes (EI⪡GA), shear locking is significant, and for the element to be free of this locking the shear strain energy should tend to vanish in this regime. This condition of vanishing shear strain energy can be examined as follows:(33)γ=a5LThe condition of shearless-flexure is satisfied if and only if the coefficients of the above equation independently tend to zero, leading toa5→0, this constraint is a true constraint. Hence the coupled displacement fields for TIMO-CP model does not produce any spurious constraints in the shear locking regime and exhibit shearless-flexure behavior.
