@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The interaction between barrier-to-autointegration factor dimer (BAF2) and LEM domain of emerin (EmLEM) was studied by molecular simulation methods. Nonspecific fragment of double-strand DNA molecule was docked with each chain of BAF2 by ZDOCK program. The model of DNA2:BAF2:EmLEM was thus constructed. The mutant Gly25Glu of BAF2 was manually constructed to explore the detailed effect of the mutation on the binding of BAF2 and EmLEM. It has been experimentally suggested that point mutation Gly25Glu can disturb the binding between BAF2 and EmLEM. Then, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on DNA2:BAF2(WT):EmLEM and DNA2:BAF2(MT):EmLEM complexes. 30ns trajectories revealed that the trajectory fluctuations of MT complex are more violent than that of the WT complex. Further, the binding free energy analysis showed that the electronegative residues Asp57, Glu61 and Asp65 from chain A, glu36 from chain B of BAF2 mainly contribute to interact with EmLEM. Besides, a stable π–π stack between trp62 and phe39 from BAF2(WT) chain B is destroyed by Glu25 in BAF2(MT). As a result, trp62 forms an interaction with glu25, and phe39 converts to strengthen affinity to EmLEM. On the other hand, Trp62 from chain A also forms a strong interaction with MT Glu25. Thus, with the docking of DNA, BAF2(MT) has higher affinity with EmLEM than BAF2(WT).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Emerin is a multiple domain lamina-associated polypeptide emerin-MAN1 (LEM) protein comprising an N-terminal globular LEM domain (EmLEM), which is separated by a hydrophobic nuclear localization signal, and a C-terminal transmembrane region (Lin et al., 2000; Wolff et al., 2001). The structure of EmLEM has two α-helices (residues 9–19 and 28–46). The α-helices form an angle for about 43° (Cai et al., 2007). Emerin localizes in the inner nuclear membrane (INM) of somatic mammalian cells, and requires A-type lamins (lamin A) (Haque et al., 2010; Wheeler and Ellis, 2010; Zhang et al., 2005; D’Angelo and Hetzer, 2006). Emerin regulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling (Muchir et al., 2007a,b, 2009) and directly binds transcription factors in developing myoblasts (Markiewicz et al., 2006; Tilgner et al., 2009; Holaska, 2008). Besides, genetic analysis yields important insights into their somatic roles (Huber et al., 2009). Human emerin and lamins mutations cause many diseases, including one or more tissues muscular dystrophy, bone, fat, connective tissue, skin, heart, blood or nervous, brain development and accelerate aging (Wolff et al., 2001; Liang et al., 2011).Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) is a small (10kDa) double strand DNA (dsDNA)-binding protein, which is highly conserved among metazoans (Lee and Craigie, 1998). One molecule of EmLEM binds a BAF dimer (BAF2) (Furukawa, 1999; Cai et al., 2001). BAF2 is necessary for assembly of emerin at the nuclear envelope (Capanni et al., 2012; Haraguchi et al., 2001). Additional roles for BAF2 in nuclear structure are suggested by its direct binding to nuclear lamins (Gruenbaum et al., 2005; Holaska et al., 2003). Interactions between BAF2 and LEM proteins at the ‘core’ region of telophase chromosomes are required to assemble lamin A filaments (Shimi et al., 2004; Segura-Totten and Wilson, 2004). BAF-null Drosophila cells fail to express cyclins, suggesting that BAF affects the gene expression of cyclin directly or indirectly (Furukawa et al., 2003). Excess BAF influences higher-order chromatin organization and nuclear envelope assembly (Segura-Totten et al., 2002).The solution NMR structure of the BAF2:EmLEM complex reveals that the binding surfaces on both BAF2 and EmLEM consist of a central hydrophobic portion surrounded by a rim of polar and charged residues, which is typical in many protein:protein complexes (Williams et al., 2004). In human cells, expression of BAF missense mutation Gly25Glu dominantly disrupts the assembly of emerin, LAP2β and lamin A into reforming nuclei (Haraguchi et al., 2001). The Gly25 locates in the interface between BAF and DNA. Related experiment suggested that Gly25Glu mutation affected emerin localization during telophase. This BAF mutant is inactive for binding to DNA, and inactive for binding to emerin and LAP2 in vitro (Haraguchi et al., 2001). Our previous study (Shang et al., 2014) shows that Gly25Glu mutation can attenuate the interactions between BAF and DNA, which is consistent with experimental observation. We utilize molecular docking, point mutation and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation to compare the differences of structure and function between wild type (WT) BAF2:EmLEM complex and Gly25Glu mutant type (MT) in BAF2:EmLEM complex.ZDOCK module (Wiehe et al., 2005) of Discovery Studio 2.5 was used to perform the docking simulation of DNA with BAF. The structures of BAF2:EmLEM complex and double strands DNA (dsDNA) were taken from Protein Data Bank (chain A in PDB code: 2ODG and chain B and C in 2BZF, respectively). The CHARMm Polar H force field (Grosdidier et al., 2011) was applied to depict all the atoms except non-polar H in molecular docking. 2000 top poses were generated and then classified into 60 clusters. The cutoff value of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was 1.0Å, and interface cutoff was 2.0Å (Accelrys Software Inc., 2007). Zrank scoring algorithm was then tested on ZDOCK benchmark dataset version 2.5 (Wiehe et al., 2005). Based on the related experimental result (Haraguchi et al., 2001), ‘Build and edit proteins’ module of Discovery Studio 2.5 (Accelrys Software Inc., 2007) was used to mutate Gly25 to Glu25 in BAF.All the MD simulations were performed on Inspur workstations using the Amber11 software package (Case et al., 2005). The ff03ua force field (Ode et al., 2007) was used for energy minimization and MD simulations. The charge of DNA2:BAF2(WT):EmLEM and DNA2:BAF2(MT):EmLEM complexes were neutralized by tleap module of Amber11. An explicit solvent model TIP3P water box (Jorgensen et al., 1983) was used with a distance of 10.0Å between complex surface and water box boundary. A minimization of 1000-step steepest descent (SD) and 1000-step conjugate gradient (CG) was carried out. The constraint force constant on protein was 500 kcalmol−1Å−2. After that, without any restraint on the whole system, a minimization of 3000-step SD and 4000-step CG was used. Then, a heating simulation was performed from 0 to 300K in 500ps with a weak constraint force constant value of 10.0 kcalmol−1Å−2. After heating, a NPT ensemble of 1atm and 300K was applied for 30ns equilibrium simulation without any constraint. Periodic boundary condition was used to the system to obtain consistent behavior. The cutoff value of nonbonded interaction was 12.0Å. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method (Essmann et al., 1995) was employed for the computation of long-range electrostatic forces. The time step was 1.0fs. A simple leapfrog integrator was used to propagate the dynamics, with the collision frequency of 1.0ps−1. A Langevin thermostat was adopted. The relaxation time for barostat bath was 2.0ps. VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996) software was used to visualize the trajectories and to depict structural representations.The MM-GB/SA method implemented in Amber11 (Gohlke et al., 2003) was applied to calculate the binding free energy between the ligand and the receptor (Swanson et al., 2004). The binding free energy (ΔGbind) in MM-GB/SA between a ligand (EmLEM) and a receptor (BAF2) to form BAF2:EmLEM complex was calculated as:(1)ΔGbind=Gcomplex−Greceptor−Gligand(2)G=EMM+Gsol−TS(3)EMM=Eint⁡+Eele+Evdw(4)Gsol=GGB+GSAIn Eq. (2), the EMM, Gsol, and TS represented molecular mechanics component in gas phase, the stabilization energy due to solvation, and a vibrational entropy term, respectively. EMM was given as a sum of Eint, Eele, and Evdw which were internal, Coulomb and van der Waals interaction terms, respectively. Solvation energy, Gsol, was separated into an electrostatic solvation free energy (GGB) and a nonpolar solvation free energy (GSA). The former could be obtained from the generalized born (GB) method. The latter was considered to be proportional to the molecular solvent accessible surface area (SASA) (Hou et al., 2008). The binding free energies were obtained by averaging over the values calculated for 2000 snapshots from the 11–20ns of the trajectories at 5ps intervals for the complex structures.We adopted the following tests to determine stacked and staggered π–π interactions (McGaughey et al., 1998; Wen et al., 2012): the default center distance cutoff was set to 8.0Å to define the distance between the centroid of each pair of aromatic rings. For these, an atom from each ring should be within the closest atom distance cutoff (4.5Å); the angle θ between the normal of one ring and the centroid–centroid vector must fall between 0° and ±the θ angle cutoff (default 60°); the angle γ between the normal to each ring must fall between 0° and ±the γ angle cutoff (default 30°) (Fig. 1).
