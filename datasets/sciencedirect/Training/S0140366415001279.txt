@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Poor medication adherence is a prevalent medical problem resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, especially for elder adults. In this paper, we propose a Socialized Prompting System (SPS), which combines ubiquitous sensors in the smart home and mobile social networks to improve medication adherence. Ubiquitous sensors benefit the seamless monitoring of medication intake behaviors, while the mobile social networks contribute to social prompting in a community. The mechanisms of medication monitoring with ubiquitous sensors and the collaborative prompting based on mobile social network are presented. The experimental results showed that the medication adherence of the testing subjects has been improved by using the proposed system.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Older adults are often accompanied with an increasing number of health problems and suffer from two or more co-occurring diseases. Therefore, multiple medication intake is common for older adults and may ameliorate symptoms, improve and extend quality of life, and occasionally cure disease [1]. Unfortunately, it is reported that more than 50% of older adults have difficulties adhering to medication regimens due to many factors, such as complex medication regimens, disease severity, and cognitive impairment [2,3]. Poor adherence is also a major risk factor for adverse drug events and other adverse health outcomes. For instance, medication-related harm in the United Kingdom is 6.5% of patients admitted to hospital and 9% of inpatients reportedly experience drug-related harm [4]. It is believed that 3–6% of all hospital admissions result from adverse drug reactions [5]. Therefore, the medication adherence is a great challenge for the health of older adults.Medication adherence refers to the extent to which a patient follows medication prescriptions [6]. In the past decade, a number of studies have been conducted to improve the medication adherence for the elderly ranging from the electronic pillboxes [7,8] to medication monitoring systems with multi-media prompting services [9–11]. MedTracker, a portable electronic pillbox, provides real-time monitoring of medication adherence [7]. However, for MedTracker, the detection of medication intake depends on the opening of lids, which cannot determine whether the medication is taken according to the prescription (e.g. overdose, time delay). The container does not know which pills are in it, when they should be taken, or when they have been taken. Fishkin and Wang [9] propose a flexible, low-overhead medication monitoring system based on Radio Frequency Identification tags (RFIDs). It detects medicine status and provides a user interface to present medication information. Prompting services are introduced as well to remind the elders to take the medicine timely with text, video, audio and image-based information [10,11]. MHS [10] is built to improve medication adherence for the elderly people through automatic medication monitoring and context-aware prompting. However it is mainly designed for individual elders in a smart home without social interaction. MoviPill [11] is a mobile phone-based game that persuades patients to be adherent to their medication prescription by means of social competition. Although the status of medication intake was shared within the group, social prompting is not implemented to remind the patients.Social factors are important in the design of healthcare services, which can make the services more user-friendly and acceptable. It is verified that frequent human communication as reminder systems are more likely to improve adherence than nonhuman reminders [3]. Research in aging and cognition has shown that social communication contributes to maintaining the cognitive performance and healthy mood in the elderly [12]. Furthermore, social participation benefits the enhancement of elders’ health. For instance, lack of social participation increases the risk of Alzheimer’s (AD) disease-like dementia [13]. The social activities (or social interaction) are demonstrated to be useful to enhance core mental capacities [14].In this paper, we aim to facilitate the medication adherence by combining ubiquitous sensors and mobile social networking. The work rooted in our previous work about MHS [10], a multimedia system to monitor the medication activities for the individuals. However, different from MHS, in this paper, mobile social networking is introduced as well to benefit socialized prompting services and improve social participation among individuals. Distinguished from the other works, all registered users in our SPS are connected via Internet and are automatically grouped based on the homophily principle [15,16]. The users in the same group are the individuals with same diseases or similar symptoms. Among group members, the social competition is introduced to enhance the social participation by reminding other group members to take medication timely.The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents related work. In Section 3, the system architecture of our proposed system is presented. More details about this system are elaborated in the following two sections: Section 4 describes the medication monitoring with ubiquitous sensors and Section 5 elaborates the collaborative prompting based on mobile social network. The prototype implementation and experimental results are presented in Section 6. We finally conclude the paper in Section 7.
