Dynamic elasticity solution for a clamped, laminated cylindrical shell with two orthotropic layers bounded with a piezoelectric layer and subjected to exponential dynamic load distributed on inner surface is presented. The piezoelectric layer serves as sensor/actuator. The governing elasticity partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations by means of Legendre polynomial expansion for displacement and electric potential in axial direction. The resulting equations are reduced to a system of ODE with constant coefficients by means of Galerkin׳s integral method and finally the governing equations are solved by using linear finite element in radial direction. The static and dynamic results are presented for [0/90/Piezo] lamination. The ratio effect of the radius to thickness on dynamic behaviour is studied. The results are compared for different thickness ratios and applied electric loads with simply-supported shell results. Time responses for sensor and actuated shell are presented.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Smart structures equipped with piezoelectric materials have been widely used as distributed sensors and actuators in the area of active structural control. In addition, lightweight high-modulus laminated shells of revolution have found extensive applications. Therefore, shell-type smart structures containing piezoelectric layers have been focused. Accurate prediction of their dynamic behaviour demands three-dimensional elasticity based numerical tools. These solutions are needed to assess the accuracy of approximate shell theories. The basic theories for the modelling of piezoelectric materials have been given in many contributions, in particular, in the pioneering works of Tiersten [1]. System equations for piezoelectric shell vibrations were derived, using Hamilton׳s principle and linear piezoelectricity [2]. Many researchers have studied the free vibration of laminated cylindrical shells. Civalek [3] carried out the free vibration analysis of laminated cylindrical shell, using Love׳s first approximation thin shell theory and discrete singular convolution (DSC) method. Hussein and Heyliger [4] analysed the free vibration of laminated cylindrical shell with piezoelectric layer by means of a discrete layer shell theory and finite element method. The coupled displacement and electrical field equations were derived for a piezoelectric cylindrical shell, based on third order shear deformation theory by PintoCarreia et al. [5], the equations were solved by finite element method. An exact three-dimensional solution for static response of a simply supported laminated piezoelectric cylinder was presented by Heyliger [6]. The exact solution for simply supported multilayered orthotropic cylindrical shell with finite length and piezoelectric layer as sensor and actuator subjected to axisymmetric thermo-electro-mechanical loading was considered by Chen et al. [7]. Kapuria et al. [8] studied the exact solution for cylindrical piezoelectric shell under various static loads. Chandrashekhara et al. presented a three-dimensional elasticity solution for an infinite laminated circular cylindrical shell subjected to banded and distributed pinch static loads [9]. Analytical solutions to the radial polarised, piezoelectric thin cylindrical shell based on kirchhoff׳s hypo-thesis expressing the axial and radial components of displacement in terms of exponential terms were presented by Ebenezer and Abraham [10]. Shakeri et al. [11] obtained the dynamic response of laminated anisotropic cylindrical panels subjected to dynamic load based on 3-D elasticity solution. The 3D-elasticity analysis of laminated cylinder with piezoelectric sensor and actuator layers was presented by Shakeri et al. [12]. A finite element formulation using the layerwise theory, developed for laminated cylindrical shell with piezoelectric layers subjected to dynamic load, besides the 3-D elasticity solution has been studied [13]. The elasticity solution for simply-supported, laminated cylindrical shell with piezoelectric layer subjected to dynamic load has been presented by the author [14]. The resulting equations are solved by Galerkin׳s finite element in radial direction. A layerwise finite element formulation for the analysis of laminated shell structures bounded with piezoelectric rings has been developed by the author [15]. The cylindrical shell is actuated with piezoelectric rings and subjected to axisymmetric dynamic load. Recently the elasticity solution for a simply-supported, laminated cylindrical shell with piezoelectric layers is presented to model the dynamic response of laminated composite shell containing piezoelectric sensors and actuators subjected to electrical and mechanical local dynamic ring/pinch loadings [16]. Khalili et al. [17] presented a closed-form formulation of 3-D refined higher-order shear deformation theory for the free vibration analysis of clamped–clamped homogenous isotropic circular cylindrical shells.In the present work, the elasticity solution of axisymmetric cross-ply laminated cylindrical shell with piezoelectric layer, subjected to axisymmetric dynamic loading is presented. The cylindrical shell with finite length is clamped at both ends and elasticity approach is used. The highly coupled partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations by means of Legendre polynomial expansion for displacement and electric potential in axial direction. The resultant equations from the governing elasticity PDE equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations by means of Legendre polynomial expansion for displacement and electric potential in axial direction. The resulting equations are reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients by means of Galerkin׳s integral method and finally the governing equations are solved by using linear finite element in radial direction. The static and dynamic stress analysis results are presented for [0/90/Piezo] lamination. The ratio effect of the radius to thickness on dynamic behaviour is studied. The results are compared for different thickness ratios and applied electric loads with simply-supported shell results. Time responses for shell with sensor and actuated piezo-layer are presented.Consider a layered composite cylinder with coordinates as inFig. 1. The linear constitutive equations for a piezoelectric material are given as follows [2]:(1)σ=Cε−eTE,D=eε+ΔEwhere the superscript T denotes the transpose of a matrix. The components of stress (σ), strain (ε), electric field (E) and electric displacement vector (D) are given in cylindrical coordinate system (r,θ, z), as follows:(2a)σ=[σrσθσzτθzτrzτrθ]T,E=[ErEθEz]Tε=[εrεθεzγθzγrzγrθ]T,D=[DrDθDz]TThe matrices [C], [e] and [Δ] denote, respectively, the elastic stiffness, piezoelectric and dielectric constants of the orthotropic piezoelectric material layer which are as follows:(2b)[C]=[c11c12c13000c12c22c23000c13c23c33000000c44000000c55000000c66],[e]=[e11e21e3100000000e620000e530],[Δ]=[Δ11000Δ22000Δ33]Piezoelectric material with hexagonal symmetric structure exhibits orthotropic behaviour relative to its polarisation axis. For a Piezoelectric material with polarisation along the radial direction the indices 2 and 3 can be interchanged.

(3) and factorising the similar u׳s, the governing equations of equilibrium in terms of displacement and electric potential for each layer of cylindrical shell become(6a)[c11∂2∂r2+c11r∂∂r−(c22r2−c55∂2∂z2)]ur+[(c13+c55)∂2∂r∂z−c23−c13r∂∂z]uz+[e11∂2∂r2+e11−e21r∂∂r+e53∂2∂z2]Ψ=ρ∂2ur∂t2[(c55+c13)∂2∂r∂z+c23+c55r∂∂z]ur+[c55∂2∂r2+c55r∂∂r+(c33∂2∂z2)]uz+[(e53+e31)∂2∂r∂z+e53r∂∂z]Ψ=ρ∂2uz∂t2[e11∂2∂r2+e21+e11r∂∂r+e53∂2∂z2]ur+[(e31+e53)∂2∂r∂z+e31r∂∂z]uz−[Δ11∂2∂r2+Δ11r∂∂r+Δ33∂2∂z2]Ψ=0This equation is derived for a nine termed stiffness matrices material and axisymmetric problems. The following non-dimensional radius is defined for sub-layer:ςk=r−Rk,ηk=ςkRk⇒ηk=rRk−1⇒1r=1Rk.(1−ηk)⇒1r2=1Rk2.(1−2ηk)where Rkis the radius of mid-plane for each sub-layer.

The forcing function contains a uniform spatial part and a temporal part, chosen as follows:(9d)P(t)=[P0×(1−e−αt)]Pawhereα=13,100The mentioned load reaches its maximum (P0=1Pa) at 0.001s. In this respect, all of the results are presented after this moment.The following Legendre polynomial solution satisfies both the Navier-like Eqs. (6) and clamped boundary conditions Eq.

(14) into the other two ordinary differential equations of Eq. (13) and integrating, three equations are obtained. By changingNitoNjand then repeating the above procedure, finally, six equations are obtained for six nodal unknowns for each element, demonstrated as follows:{X}eT={ϕrinϕrjnϕzimϕzjmψimψjm}After applying integration by part, Eq.

The system of six equations is written in the following F.E matrix form for the non boundary base element:(17)[M]e{X¨}e+[K]e{X}e={F}ewhere[M]eand[K]eare the 6×6 mass and stiffness matrices and{F}eis the 6×1 force vector. The inter-laminar continuity conditions for stress components (Eqs. (8)) are expressed in terms of displacement components by using Eq. (5) and replacing the derivatives by backward and forward finite difference approximation for top node of kth layer (denoted by kI) and bottom node of (k+1)th layer (denoted by kI+1), respectively (Fig. 1). The superscripts n, m (for each number of considered Legendre terms N) are dropped from node variables for convenience. The displacement components on the interface boundaries are obtained in term of the values at neighbouring nodes as follows:(18)ϕr(kI)k=ϕr(kI+1)k+1=Aϕr(kI−1)k+Bϕr(kI+2)k+1+Cϕθ(kI−1)k+Dϕθ(kI+2)k+1+Eϕz(kI−1)k+Fϕz(kI+2)k+1+Gψ(kI−1)k+Hψ(kI+2)k+1ϕθ(kI)k=ϕθ(kI+1)k+1=A′ϕr(kI−1)k+B′ϕr(kI+2)k+1+C′ϕθ(kI−1)k+D′ϕθ(kI+2)k+1+E′ϕz(kI−1)k+F′ϕz(kI+2)k+1+G′ψ(kI−1)k+H′ψ(kI+2)k+1ϕz(kI)k=ϕz(kI+1)k+1=A′′ϕr(kI−1)k+B′′ϕr(kI+2)k+1+C′′ϕθ(kI−1)k+D′′ϕθ(kI+2)k+1+E′′ϕz(kI−1)k+F′′ϕz(kI+2)k+1+G′′ψ(kI−1)k+H′′ψ(kI+2)k+1ψ(kI)k=ψ(kI+1)k+1=A′′′ϕr(kI−1)k+B′′′ϕr(kI+2)k+1+C′′′ϕθ(kI−1)k+D′′′ϕθ(kI+2)k+1+E′′′ϕz(kI−1)k+F′′′ϕz(kI+2)k+1+G′′′ψ(kI−1)k+H′′′ψ(kI+2)k+1where A, B,…,H‴are constant coefficients. Substitutingϕandψfrom Eq. (18) into Eq. (17) and using finite difference method, the following matrix equations for top node of kth layer are obtained. The finite element equilibrium equations for two neighbouring elements at interior interfaces are obtained as the following matrix form:(19)[M]k{X¨}k+[K]k{X}k={0},[M]k+1{X¨}k+1+[K]k+1{X}k+1={0}Applying the above procedure to the boundary condition Eqs. (9) for the first and last nodes on the inner and outer surfaces, the degrees of freedom for these nodes are obtained due to inner node variables, and then from Eq. (17), the finite element equilibrium equations for the first and last elements become(20)[M]1{X¨}1+[K]1{X}1={F}1,[M]MI{X¨}MI+[K]MI{X}MI={F}MIBy assembling Eqs. (17), (19) and (20), the global finite element equation is obtained as(21)[[MUU]000]e{{U¨}{Ψ¨}}e+[[KUU][KUΨ][KΨU][KΨΨ]]e{{U}{Ψ}}e={{P(t)}{q(t)}}e{U}, {Ψ}, {P(t)} and {q(t)} are the vectors of generalised mechanical displacement, electric potential, generalised force and electric load, respectively. By using the implicit Newmark method, the static finite element matrix equations are obtained. Then the Gauss elimination method is used and the system of equations is solved to give nodal unknown variables. Finally, the displacement components are obtained using Eqs. (10). A suitable time step, Δt, should be used in order to capture all the vibrational modes in the shell.For free vibration analysis, the coupled system of Eq. (21) can be reduced to a purely mechanical one by condensing statically the electrical unknowns, as follows:(22){Ψ}=−[KΨΨ]−1[KΨU]{U}Substitution of this relation into the mechanical equation of (21) gives(23){[KUU]−[KUΨ][KΨΨ]−1[KΨU]}{U}=ωmn2[MUU]{U}As usual, the free-vibration response of the condensed system Eq.

The results obtained for a cylindrical composite shell with two orthotropic layers, perfectly bounded with outer piezoelectric sensor layer is considered. The cross-ply cylindrical shell is laid-up with sequence (0/90/Piezo). Composite layers are made of graphite-epoxy with following material properties:Ez=76.8×109Pa,Er=Eθ=5.5×109Pa,Gzr=Gzθ=2.07×109PaGθr=1.4×109Pa,νzr=νzθ=0.34,νθr=0.37The piezoelectric material is PZT-4 with elastic transversely isotropic behaviour and radially polarised. The material properties of PZT-4 are given inTable 1[12]. whereηis the absolute permittivity constant of piezoelectric material. To comply with the simply-supported shell results [14], the following non-dimensionalisations have been used:(26)u¯r,θ,z=(10000)EθH(S4)(ur,θ,z),(σ¯r,τ¯rz,σ¯θ,σ¯z)=(σr,τrz,σθ/S,σz/S)p∘The non-dimensional radius, length and thickness ratio are defined as follows:r¯=r−RmH,z¯=zL,S=RmH,where Rmis the radius of the mid-plane, H is the total shell thickness and Eθ is the circumferential elastic moduli of shell material (in case of graphite-epoxy: 5.5GPa). The radius of the shell mid-plane is considered Rm=0.4m, the shell thickness is variant and the length of cylinder is L=1.0m. The ratio of mid-layer radius to thickness S=Rm/H is considered 4 and 10 ranging from thick shell to rationally thin one.Firstly, the case of static loading is conducted by comparing the results with simply-supported shell. The shell is under an internal axisymmetric uniform distributed pressure of 1Pa.Firstly, a convergence study is accomplished. The static results for shell with thickness ratios S=10, 4 and different number of Legendre polynomial terms are given inTable 2. It is obvious that very good accuracy is achieved at N=15 for S=10 and 4. Therefore, each layer is divided into 12 radial elements and 15 terms are considered in Legendre polynomial series. The outer piezoelectric layer serves as both sensor and actuator.The radial displacement distribution through the thickness at the mid length of the shell z=L/2 for sensor and actuator cases are shown inFig. 3. Because of the non-dimensioning, radial displacement of thick shell is greater than radial displacement of thin shell. This figures show that results are continuous and for thick shell it varies nonlinearly in composite layers. As expected, for thin shell the maximum deflection is uniform through thickness, resulting in a membrane state. By imposing the piezoelectric layer to positive applied electric load (+0.2) the radial displacement increases and negative electric load (−0.2) causes the inward (negative) radial deflection against the internal pressure. For thick actuated shell under positive electric load, the radial displacement on mid-plane of shell (r¯=0) is four times as large as the similar value for sensor case, while this ratio for thick actuated shell under negative electric load is about 2.84. InFig. 4a comparison between the radial displacements through the thickness of clamped and simply-supported boundary conditions [14] for sensor case is presented. For thick shell a 6.66% reduction and for thin shell a 3.1% reduction is observed in the mid layer.Fig. 5 illustrates the electric potential distribution in the shell thickness at the mid length of the shell. For actuator case the thickness does not have effect on linear distribution of electric potential. For sensor case (Fig. 6) the distribution of electric potential for thick shell is more nonlinear.Fig. 7 compares the radial stress distribution through the thickness for clamped and simply-supported boundary conditions [14], the piezo-layer serves as sensor. The boundary and inter laminar conditions of radial stress are satisfied in this figure. Generally, simply-supported shell results in greater radial stress in 0° layer which is at most 5.9% for shell with thickness ratio=4. FromFig. 8 it is obvious that by applying the actuator voltage, the radial stress experiences a sever increases at the piezo interface with 90° layer, which become tensile for positive electric load. The applied voltage does not affect the radial stress near the inner surface of thin shell and the radial stress in the 0° layer is same for all thicknesses and likes to be linear.Fig. 9 illustrates the normal circumferential stress through the thickness for static load at the shell mid-span. The hoop stress should be about zero in 0° layer, since it is sustained by fibres in 90° layer. The difference of results for positive and negative applied voltage for thin shell is about 2.8 times greater. InFig. 10a comparison with simply-support results is given. The reduction of displacement and strain results in sensible decrease of stress for clamped case.Fig. 11 shows the axial stresses for uniformly distributed load. This stress is due to the amount of bending in the shell. Longitudinal stress is almost zero in 90° layer, since the fibres are normal to stress. The difference between results is serious for thin shell in inner layer. Then the effect of applied electrical load on axial stress can be observed inFig. 12 showing affected stress in piezo-layer.Fig. 13 shows the greatest transverse shear stress at the ends of clamped cylindrical shell for different thicknesses which is very close to a parabola form in piezo-sensor layer and almost constant in 90° layer. The thinner sensor shell owns a larger transverse shear stress. By applying the electric load, the maximum stress grows about 7.5 and 1.5 times for thick and thin shell, respectively. As expected, this stress has zero value on inner and outer surfaces (satisfying traction free condition).The radial displacement distributions on the mid-layer and over the half length of thin and thick shell are presented inFig. 14, showing the zero slope at the end. The effect of applied electric load on radial displacement can be adopted with values given in Fig. 3. InFig. 15a comparison for the radial displacements over the half length between the clamped and simply-supported boundary conditions [14] for sensor case are presented.Fig. 16 gives the variations of the axial displacement on the mid-plane over the shell half length for sensor and under actuated cases. The clamped boundary condition for axial displacement (Eq. (7)) has been satisfied. As the final result of static loading, the effect of shell length on the radial displacement of mid-layer at the mid-span for clamped, simply-supported and shell with infinite length has been studied inFig. 17 for different lengths. For the length to radius ratio greater than about 0.85 and 1.5 for simply-supported and clamped shell, respectively, the radial displacements at mid-span become constant. As depicted, for latter case this constant value is the displacement of shell with infinite length (plain strain condition). Actually, these are the lengths at which the boundary conditions impinge on the results.The dynamic load is applied as given in Eq. (9d). After t=0.001s, the load on the shell reaches to its pick (P0=1Pa) and becomes constant. The results are presented at the end time of the analysis at t=5.0ms. The proper time step is chosen regarding the convergence and accuracy. The non-dimensional radial displacement variations across the middle of cylindrical shell for different S ratios are shown inFig. 18. The inertia effect is complete obviously stronger for thick actuator shell resulting in radial displacement curve distortions. The deflections (ur) at mid-layer experience a 13% and a 33% augmentation with respect to static values for sensory thin and thick shells, respectively. InFig. 19 the radial stress distribution through the thickness of shell at z=L/2 and t=5ms are shown. The inertia effect on radial stress distribution for sensor case is negligible. It was noticed in Fig. 8 that for statically actuated shell, the radial stresses of thick and thin shells are very similar. But in dynamic loading the negatively actuated thin shell possesses a maximum radial stress about 2.55 times greater than thick actuated shell. InFig. 20, the hoop stresses in thickness of mid-span are publicised. This stress should be about zero in 0° layer, again. For dynamic loading, the inertia has a small effect on the circumferential stress results, the maximum hoop stress has become 18.18% and 9% larger than static values for actuator thin and thick shells, respectively. But the distribution curve has been deformed for actuator cases. The discontinuity of in-plane normal stresses is of importance for bonding of layers, and it can cause delaminating (especially for the hoop stress). The maximum hoop stress at the interface of the outer surface for thin shell is about 3 times larger than thick one. InFig. 21 the transverse shear stress distributions across the thickness at t=5ms are shown. The thinner shell owns a larger transverse shear stress in all layers. The result curves are much distorted and experience oscillations with respect to static load demonstrating the sever effect of inertia on this stress. The stress becomes negative in piezoelectric layer for negative applied electric load. For thin actuated shell, the maximum transverse shear stress has a 3 times greater maximum value than similar static value. Considering the potentiality of this stress for causing delamination, a failure analysis can be conducted. The radial displacement distributions on the mid-layer and over the half length of sensor and actuator shells at t=5ms are presented inFig. 22, the zero slopes at the end is maintained. The effect of inertia is more obvious from the distortions in results of thick shell under electrical load. The results of radial displacement at mid-span (z=0.5m) can be compared with values of dynamic results on the mid-layer (r¯=0) given in Fig. 18. The mid-plane axial displacement distribution through the half length of shell is depicted inFig. 23, which is zero at the end and middle of shell, because of the symmetry in shell and loading. The effect of inertia is more intense for thick shell under positive electric load. For sensor case, the axial displacement has grown about 2.6 and 2 times greater with respect to static ones for thick and thin shells, respectively. For actuator cases, the maximum axial displacement has grown about 5 and 4 times greater with respect to static ones for thick and thin shells, respectively. From the above results, the wave propagation in the length of shell can be studied.The time response of non-dimensional radial displacement at the half length (z=L/2) of shell middle-plane for sensory case, up to t=5ms are presented inFig. 24 for different thickness ratios. After the load becomes constant, the forced vibration with an almost periodic behaviour occurs. InFig. 25 the time histories of radial displacement for actuated shells with S=4 and 10 are illustrated. At t=5ms the results can be compared with values of radial displacement given in Figs. 18 and 22. As it is expected, the greater oscillation period belongs to thin shell and the greatest amplitude belongs to thick shell under positive electric load, in which there are more sever oscillations showing the effect of inertia. From the above results, the effect of piezoelectric layer as an actuator on dynamic behaviour of cylindrical shell can be observed as an artificial stiffness/damping for positive/negative applied electric load.To evaluate the formulation and solution method, the axisymmetric free vibration of an isotropic cylinder with clamped–clamped boundary conditions is considered in the test example; to demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of the present formulations, the results from the present theory are compared with those reported by Khalili et al. [17]. A wide range of H/R and L/R ratios are investigated.Table 3 shows the comparison between the present results for the lowest natural frequency parameterω⁎=ωRρ(1−ν2)Ewith those obtained using three-dimensional (3-D) refined higher-order shear deformation theory (RHOST) approach. As indicated in Table 3, in the case of axisymmetric mode of vibrations, for smaller values of H/R and H/L, the results are closer to the results of RHOST [17]. It is seen that for higher values of H the agreement between the results decreases.
