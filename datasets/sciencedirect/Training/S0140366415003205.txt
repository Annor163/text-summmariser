@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We have defined and implemented a Facebook application to log a Facebook dataset.We have studied and validated the structural properties of the whole dataset and of the Dunbar ego networks.We have analyzed the interactions of the users.The availability of the users in the Dunbar ego networks have been investigated.Our results reveal the presence of the temporal homophily property in the Dunbar ego networks.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Online Social Networks (OSNs) are the most popular applications in todays Internet and they have changed the way people interact with each other. Understanding the structural properties of OSNs and, in particular, how users behave when they connect to OSNs is crucial for designing user-centered systems. Results about OSNs demonstrated that the relationships that an individual (ego) maintains with other people (alters) can be organized into a set of circles (named Dunbar’s circles) according to the ego network model. The study of the impact of ego networks structure on the availability patterns of users is seriously limited by the lack of information about users availability patterns. In this work we contribute to fill this gap by analysing availability information of a sample of Facebook users. The data reveal a number of strong temporal dependencies (or temporal homophily) which provide insights into the availability pattern that characterize an ego network.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become widely used in the last few years. Because of their huge impact on people’s lives, OSNs became a quite interesting research field and resource for many scientists: sociologists are investigating the dynamics occurring inside OSNs and trying to compare them with real life behaviors [1–3], computer scientists and engineers are focusing on the technical side by studying their properties [4,5], improving these architectures [6–8] and optimizing their usage [9].Users of the OSNs generate a high-volume of valuable information which are controlled and stored by the centralized providers. Although users are forced to trust the provider of the services, recent events have shown that in addition to malicious users (internal or external to the OSN), also the centralized service provider [10] introduce new security and privacy risks. However, recently, users are realizing the privacy risks deriving from giving up their data to a centralized service. For these reasons in the last years, scientists are studying new infrastructures to offer OSN services by exploiting distributed (for instance P2P) patterns. Diaspora11https://diasporafoundation.org/, with about 400,00022https://diasp.eu/statsusers, is one of the most successful OSN services implemented in a decentralized way. These systems are referred as Distributed Online Social Networks (DOSNs) [11] and their development has to face a large number of issues. The main one is the data availability and persistence problem because of the lack of a central server storing users’ data and because of the intrinsic dynamism of these networks. When users disconnect from the OSN, the knowledge of their friendship relationships and of the kind of interactions with their friends may be exploited to store data on trusted contacts so avoiding data encryption which would otherwise be required if data is stored on any node of the network (needed for instance in DTN or CDN-based approaches). A further challenge is to consider the availability patterns of the nodes in the ego network to define data allocation, with the goal of avoiding continual data transfers which affect the overall performance of the social service. The study of the temporal behavior of users in OSNs, in particular the study of the relation between online sessions of egos and those of their alters is therefore of primary importance to help the decentralization of social services by characterizing the typical OSNs’ usage and understanding how users interact with these platforms.In the last few years, the study of ego networks in virtual environments has received more and more attention [12]. Ego networks are social networks made up of an individual (ego) and all the social relations it has with other people (alters). Even if available OSNs datasets has led to a better understanding of OSNs at global structural level [13–15], as well as at the level of local structural properties [1,2,15,16], some characteristics of ego networks still remain unexplored, particularly their temporal characteristics because of the lack of real temporal data. Temporal properties of OSNs’ users are important for different purposes. The studies of user behaviors allow the performance of existing systems to be evaluated and lead to a better site design of the OSN services. Moreover, understanding ego network temporal properties in DOSNs is crucial for social studies as well as for the analysis of the dynamic processes that occur on them (such as protocol for the information diffusion [5]). Finally, understanding the temporal correlation between users sessions is valuable in designing the next-generation of OSN infrastructures, such as Distributed Online Social Networks [11] and Content Distribution Systems [6–8]. While few recent studies examined the availability patterns of OSNs’ users by focusing either on the time that the user spends online [17] or on the interaction frequency [4,18], they do not provide a global picture of the relation between the ego network structure of users and the availability patterns of the alters belonging to their ego-network. The aim of this paper is to investigate the presence of temporal dependency in the ego network structure of OSNs by analysing a large set of social information about Facebook users, collected by a novel Facebook application we have developed33Available at: http://socialcircles.eu/. Temporal patterns can be exploited to manage important problems in a distributed scenario, such as data availability [7] and information diffusion [8]. Using this sample of Facebook users, we find a strong relation between the ego network structure of an ego and the availability patterns of the alters in the ego network. The main result of the paper is the identification of a relation between the similarity (or temporal homophily) between the availability patterns of the egos and their alters, which increases when considering alters belonging to inner Dunbar circles. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic concepts used and the related work Section 3 describes the data set and the methodology used to collect them. Section 4 presents the results and the methodologies used to analyze: the structural properties of the network (Section 4.1) and the interactions of the users and their Dunbar’s ego network structure (Section 4.2). The Section 5 investigates the main result, that is the analysis of the temporal features of our data set. Finally, Section 6 draws the main conclusions.
