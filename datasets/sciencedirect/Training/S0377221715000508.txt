@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In a multi-component system, the assumption of failure independence among components is seldom valid, especially for those complex systems with complicated failure mechanism. For such systems, warranty cost is subject to all the factors including system configuration, quality of each component and the extent of failure dependence among components. In this paper, a model is developed based on renewing free-replacement warranty by considering failure interaction among components. It is assumed that whenever a component (subsystem) fails, it can induce a failure of one or more of the remaining components (subsystems). Cost models for series and parallel system configurations are presented, followed by numerical examples with sensitivity analysis. The results show that, compared with series systems, warranty cost for parallel systems is more sensitive to failure interaction.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A warranty is an assurance by the manufacturer (vendors, sellers, or third parties) to the buyer which requires manufacturers to offer pre-defined compensation to buyers if the product or service fails to meet the standards under normal usage within warranty duration (Vahdani, Mahlooji, & Eshraghnia Jahromi, 2013; van der Heijden & Iskandar, 2013; Xie, Liao, & Zhu, 2014). Different types of warranties are offered by manufacturers based on the characteristics of products, e.g., the products’ complexity, reparability, and reliability (Lo & Yu, 2013). These characteristics are closely related to the key target of warranty research – warranty cost modeling.There are numerous warranty policies adopted in cost modeling. Detailed studies can be found in Sheu and Chien (2005), Bouguerra, Chelbi, and Rezg (2012), Park, Mun Jung, and Park (2013), Shafiee and Chukova (2013), Xie and Liao (2013). Specifically, cost modeling under renewing free-replacement policy (RFRW) is extensively studied in literature (Chien, 2008, 2012; Wu & Xie, 2008; Darghouth, Chelbi, & Ait-Kadi, 2012; Vahdani, Chukova, & Mahlooji, 2011; Yeh, Chen, & Chen, 2005). Under the RFRW policy, a product failed within the warranty period is replaced by a new one with a full warranty. Bai and Pham (2006) proposed a renewing ‘full-service’ warranty for multi-component system, which assumes an extra perfect maintenance upon system failure after the normal free replacement under RFRW.Related research has been focused increasingly on the warranty studies for complex systems. The main reason is due to the need for an accurate estimation of warranty cost for those systems as the warranty cost could be very high. When a complex system is treated as a ‘single-component’ system or a ‘black box’, the inner structure information is ignored (Wu and Xie, 2008; Ye, Murthy, Xie, & Tang, 2013). It is desirable to consider a different warranty policy for multi-component system when failure of several units instead of one unit results in the warranty cost (Bai & Pham, 2006; Scarf & Majid, 2011). When shifting the reliability analysis from single item to multiple items, failure dependence is a common phenomenon that cannot be neglected (see Peng, Coit, & Feng, 2012; Tsoukalas & Agrafiotis, 2013;Yu, Chu, Châtelet, & Yalaoui, 2007). Murthy and Nguyen (1985) formulated three different types (Types I–III) of failure interaction for a two-component system. Type I failure interaction assumes that whenever a component fails, it can induce a simultaneous failure of one or more of the remaining components of the system. They define this simultaneous failure of the remaining components as ‘induced failure’, compared with ‘natural failure’ described by components’ lifetime distribution without failure interaction. Type II failure interaction is known as failure rate interaction, which assumes a change on failure rate of components whenever a component fails. It is further discussed by Zequeira and Bérenguer (2005), Lai (2008), and Golmakani and Moakedi (2012). A combination model of Type I and Type II is the Type III failure interaction (Murthy & Nguyen, 1985). So far, failure interaction is mainly discussed in maintenance models. Warranty cost models under failure interaction are seldom explored.In this paper, we present a warranty cost model with Type I failure interaction under a type of renewing free-replacement warranty (RFRW). The target system is composed of multiple components and is repairable. Compared with previous works, the following two important extensions are made in this paper. (1) Instead of assuming independent failures among components, we derive the expected warranty cost based on certain failure interaction model. (2) We consider failure interaction between each two components instead of the failure interaction between one component and the whole remaining components. Warranty cost models for system configurations such as series and parallel are discussed separately, which provides a basis for future study of even more complex system configurations, such as parallel-series, series-parallel, hierarchical, and k-out-of-n. Since failure dependence is a common problem in complex system which affects both system reliability and service cost, this paper can help decision-makers better evaluate system reliability and reduce risk in estimating future warranty cost.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model and the assumptions for multi-component system subject to failure interaction, maintenance strategy and warranty policy. Sections 3 and 4 formulate the specific warranty cost models under series and parallel structure. Section 5 gives numerical examples for a 3-component parallel system; comparison with series system is made to illustrate the result. Conclusions and potential extensions are made in Section 6.This section provides preliminary assumptions and model specifications in RFRW and failure interaction.We follow the standard assumptions on RFRW such as those presented in Bai and Pham (2006). A pre-specified warranty period is denoted by w.TS=∑ti+wdenotes the total time under warranty (warranty cycle), and ti(ti< w) is the system lifetime.Several assumptions on RFRW for a multi-component system are made as follows:1.Failed components within TS are fully replaced. Meanwhile, warranty terms are renewed by manufacturers.When the system fails, a perfect maintenance effort (Borrero & Akhavan-Tabatabaei, 2013; Chen, Ye, & Xie, 2013; Shafiee, Finkelstein, & Zuo, 2013) is conducted for the survived components to reduce the chances of future system failures. Upon this assumption, the system is restored to the state of “as good as new” after each warranty service due to system failure.Warranty cost is subject to two items: one is the replacement cost of the failed components; the other is the maintenance cost due to system failure.In order to reduce the complexity of the cost model, maintenance cost per system failure is assumed to be a constant (Liu, Xu, Xie, & Kuo, 2014; Wang, 2002). It is defined as the average maintenance service cost throughout all the system failures within warranty cycle TS.We consider Type I failure interaction among components, which can be interpreted as follows (Murthy & Nguyen, 1985):1.Let Ω = {1, 2, …, } denote the number of components. Consider an n-component system with series or parallel structure. For each component, there are two types of failures – natural failure and induced failure. The natural failures are characterized by the lifetime distribution function Fi(t) (i ∈ Ω), and the induced failures are caused by failure of other components.Type I failure interaction assumes that a natural failure of component i can cause the induced failure of component j with probability pij, and has no effect on component j with probability qij= 1 − pij. i, j ∈ Ω. Apparently pii= 1, qii= 0. The interaction information can be integrated into the following matrix:Failure dependence probability matrix (FDPM )P=(pij)=[1p12……p1,n−1p1,np211……p2,n−1p2,n⋮⋮⋱⋱⋮⋮⋮⋮⋱⋱⋮⋮pn−1,1pn−1,2……1pn−1,npn,1pn,2……pn,n−11],×pij∈[0,1],∀i,j∈ΩThe parameters in matrix P can be estimated from test data by either parametric or nonparametric estimation techniques (Kapur, 2014). Particularly, regression model is an efficient method to deal with correlated failure time data (Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 2011).RemarksFailure interaction occurs either due to system mechanism or design problem, which decreases the system reliability and increases the warranty cost. Usually, the additional warranty cost induced by failure interaction is neglected by manufacturers when making warranty decisions. For a well-designed system, FDPM is a sparse matrix and the value of non-zero entry is relatively small. However, in practice, many systems do not perform as well as expected, and the warranty cost due to failure interaction cannot be neglected. Throughout this study, only Type I failure interaction is considered. The extension study on Type II or III failure interaction is left for future work.Some critical definitions are made as follows:1.Define NS(w) as the number of warranty renewals within warranty cycle TS. fS(t) and FS(t) are denoted as the probability density function (pdf) and the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the system failure time. RS(t) = 1 − FS(t) is the system reliability function. hS(t) = fS(t)/RS(t) is the system hazard rate function. Similarly, fi(t), Fi(t), Ri(t), and hi(t) are defined as the pdf, cdf, reliability function, and hazard rate function of component i, i ∈ Ω.For a series system, let Ti(i ∈ Ω) be the natural failure time of component i. Define pi(w) ≡ Pr[Ti≤ Yi, Ti≤ w] and αi(w) ≡ pi(w)/FS(w), where Yi= min(Tj, ∀j ∈ Ω, j ≠ i), Ω = {1, 2, …, n}. pi(w) can be interpreted as the probability that a natural failure of component i occurs within warranty period w. Given a system failure within w, αi(w) denotes the probability that the system failure is caused by the natural failure of component i. Lemma 1 presents the expressions of pi(w) and αi(w).For an n-component series system, we havepi(w)=∫0whi(t)RS(t)dtαi(w)=1FS(w)∫0whi(t)RS(t)dt∑i=1npi(w)=FS(w),∑i=1nαi(w)=1SeeAppendix Ifor detailed proof.In this section, a warranty cost model is derived for a series system under failure interaction. It is obvious that(1)FS(w)=1−∏i=1n(1−Fi(w))=1−∏i=1nRi(w)We further define Ni(i ∈ Ω) as the number of natural failures of component i within warranty cycle TS, and Nijas the number of induced failures of component j caused by the natural failures of component i.The distribution of Nijcan be obtained with the following lemma.Lemma 2∀i, j ∈ Ω, i ≠ j, the probability mass function (pmf) of Nij follows a geometric distribution with parameter RS(w)/(RS(w) + pijpi(w)),(2)p(Nij=nij)=(pijpi(w)RS(w)+pijpi(w))nijRS(w)RS(w)+pijpi(w)∀nij=0,1,2,…(3)E[Nij]=pijpi(w)RS(w)When i = j, we have(4)p(Ni=ni)=(pi(w)RS(w)+pi(w))niRS(w)RS(w)+pi(w)∀ni=0,1,2,…(5)E[Ni]=pi(w)RS(w)Note that Nii= Ni for all i. Detailed proof is shown inAppendix II.According to the assumptions of RFRW in Section 2, the warranty cost (WC) can be divided into two parts: component replacement cost and maintenance cost. We define cias the replacement cost of component i (i ∈ Ω) and cM the system maintenance cost. Then(6)WC=∑i,j∈ΩcjNij+cMNS(w)=∑i,j∈ΩcjNij+∑i∈ΩcMNi(7)E[WC]=∑i∈Q{∑j∈QcjE[Nij]+cME[Ni]}The expected warranty cost E[WC] can be obtained according to Lemma 2. The expected warranty cost per cycle (CR) can be obtained as(8)E[CR]=∑i∈Ω{pi(w)RS(w)(∑j∈Ωcjpij+cM)}RemarksUnder series structure, failure interaction has no impact on system lifetime distribution FS(w). Whenever a natural failure occurs, the system fails despite of the induced failures. In the following section, we will derive a warranty cost model for parallel system. Since a parallel system fails when all the components have failed, FS(w) is related with the level of failure interaction.For a parallel system, system fails when all the components have failed, and the one-time warranty cost can be expressed as∑i=1nci+cM. Both the system lifetime distribution and the warranty cost are affected by failure interaction under parallel structure.As the number of warranty renewals NS(w) satisfy a geometric distribution (Bai & Pham, 2006), NS ∼ G(RS(w)), i.e.,p(NS=i)=(1−RS(w))iRS(w)We can obtain the expected warranty cost per cycle as(9)E[CR]=(∑i=1nci+cM)FS(w)RS(w)In order to calculate the warranty cost per cycle for the system, we need to calculate FS(w) and RS(w) first, which is hard to obtain when the number of components is large or when the lifetime distribution is arbitrary. In the following section, we present a generalized recursive algorithm for the calculation of FS(w). Specifically, an illustrative example is performed, where components in the system follows exponential lifetime distribution.Consider an n-component parallel system. DenotePΩ(a,b)as the cdf of lifetime distribution before b conditioned on that “no component fails before time a”. It is easy to verify that, for ∀a, b, c ≥ 0, a < b, P∅(a, b) = 1 andPΩ(c,c)=0. Let Pφ(t, w) be the probability that the subsystem φ fails before w conditioned on that “no component in φ fails before time t”, φ⊆Ω.Recall that Tiis the failure time of component i and tkis the system lifetime in the kth renewal cycle. Let Yi= min(Tj, ∀j ∈ Ω, j ≠ i) and Zi= max(Tj, ∀j ∈ Ω, j ≠ i). Assume that natural failures of components occur one by one, i.e., no multiple natural failures occur simultaneously. Using the definition of Yiand Zi, we can obtain(10){tk≤w}=∪i∈Ω{Zi≤w,Ti≤Yi}∀k∈1,2,…and(11)PΩ(a,w)=FS(w)RS(a)=∑i∈Ω∫awGΩ(Zi≤w,Yi≥t)∏j≠i,j∈ΩRj(t)∏j∈ΩRj(a)dFi(t)whereGΩ[Zi≤w,Yi≥t]=Pr(noinducedfailurehappens)PΩ−{i}(t,w)+∑j∈Ω−{i}Pr(onlyEijhappens)PΩ−{i,j}(t,w)+∑j,k∈Ω−{i}Pr(onlyEij,Eikhappens)PΩ−{i,j,k}(t,w)+⋯+∑j∈Ω−{i}Pr(onlyEijdoesnothappens)Pj(t,w)+Pr(Eijhappens,∀j∈Ω−{i})P∅(t,w)GΩ[Zi≤w,Yi≥t]denotes the probability that all components fail within [t, w] conditioned on that component i has failed at time t. Eijis defined as the event that failure of component j is induced by the natural failure of component i,∀i, j ∈ Ω. We can haveGΩ[Zi≤w,Yi≥t]=(∏l∈Ω−{i}qil)PΩ−{i}(t,w)+∑j∈Ω−{i}[(∏l∈Ω−{i,j}qil)pijPΩ−{i,j}(t,w)]+∑j,k∈Ω−{i}[(∏l∈Ω−{i,j,k}qil)pijpikPΩ−{i,j,k}(t,w)]+⋯+∑j∈Ω−{i}[qij(∏l∈Ω−{i,j}pil)P{j}(t,w)]+∏j∈Ω−{i}pijSpecifically, FS(w) can be interpreted as the system lifetime distribution before w conditioned on that “no component fails before time 0”, i.e.,PΩ(0,w)=FS(w). Therefore(12)FS(w)=∑i∈ΩPr[Zi≤w,Ti≤Yi]=∑i∈Ω∫0wGΩ(Zi≤w,Yi≥t)×∏j≠i,j∈ΩRj(t)dFi(t)RemarksAccording to the recursive formula presented above, lifetime distribution of all the subset φ is required to compute FS(w). Denote |φ| as the number of elements in the subset φ and |Ω| = n. When n is large, it is troublesome to calculate all the Pφ(x, y) as the number of subsets in Ω is 2n− 1. However, if the components of the system follow exponential lifetime distribution, the computing process is significantly simplified. In the following section, we generalize a recursive algorithm to compute FS(w) by using the memoryless property of exponential distribution and Laplace transformation.In this section, we present an illustrative example of a parallel system with failure interaction when the lifetime of each component follows an exponential distribution. Exponential lifetime distribution has been widely used in areas of reliability and statistics, due to lack of memory property and mathematical tractability (Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 2011). In this section, we use exponential distribution to characterize the failure time of components for illustrative purpose.Lemma 3For any parallel system with failure interaction, if each component follows an exponential lifetime distribution, Ti∼ exp(λi), we have(13)PΩ(x,y)=PΩ(x−a,y−a)where Ti is the lifetime of component i, i ∈ Ω = {1, 2, …, n}, y ≥ x ≥ a ≥ 0The detailed proof is presented inAppendix III.Specifically, if x = a, we have(14)PΩ(0,y−x)=PΩ(x,y)DefineFΩ(x)as the system lifetime distribution, we have(15)FΩ(x)=PΩ(0,x)RemarksLemma 3 is an exhibition of memoryless property generalized from the component level to the system level under parallel structure.Next, convolution and Laplace transformations are adopted to facilitate the calculation of system reliability.For the following integration,(16)Ii,φ=∫0wPφ(t,w)λie−∑m=1nλmtdt=∫0wFφ(w−t)λie−∑m=1nλmtdtwhere φ⊆Ω − {i}. By taking Laplace transformation, we have(17)L[Ii,φ]=L[Fφ(w)]λis+∑m=1nλmReferring to the expression of Gφ(Zi, Yi) andPΩ(w), we can obtain(18)L[PΩ(w)]=∑i∈ΩL[GΩ(Zi≤w,Yi≥0)]λis+∑m=1nλmwhereL[GΩ(Zi≤w,Yi≥0)]=(∏j∈Ω−{i}qij)L[PΩ−{i}(w)]+∑j∈Ω−{i}[(∏l∈Ω−{i,j}qil)pijL[PΩ−{i,j}(w)]]+∑j,k∈Ω−{i}[(∏l∈Ω−{i,j,k}qil)pijpikL[PΩ−{i,j,k}(w)]]+⋯+∑j∈Ω−{i}[qij(∏l∈Ω−{i,j}pil)L[P{j}(w)]]+1s∏j∈Ω−{i}pijIn this section, we perform two numerical examples to illustrate the cost model. In Section 5.1, we consider the case where the components follow exponential lifetime distribution. In Section 5.2, we analyze the warranty cost for components suffering degradation process.Consider a 3-component parallel system shown in Fig. 1(a). Let cM = $220 and warranty period length w = 6 time units. Each time unit is 6 months. Other parameters are given in Table 1. The parameters of component lifetime are chosen such that R(t) > 0.80 for t ≤ 8 time units (4 years). Here we assume that the all the components follow an exponential lifetime distribution, which implies constant failure rate of the components. Also, a series system is presented for comparison, as shown in Fig. 1(b).The failure dependence probability matrix (FDPM) P = (pij) (i, j ∈ Ω) is given as:(19)P3×3=[10.10.050.0710.20.170.131]where Ω = {1, 2, 3}.Using the data in Table 1 and FDPM, we show the procedure of the recursive algorithm presented in Eq. (18).Step 1: For single-component sub-system, we getSubsystem S{1}:L[P{1}(w)]=1s−1s+λ1=1s−1s+1/50Subsystem S{2}:L[P{2}(w)]=1s−1s+λ2=1s−1s+1/60Subsystem S{3}:L[P{3}(w)]=1s−1s+λ3=1s−1s+1/40Step 2: For 2-component sub-system, we haveSubsystem S{1, 2}, S{1, 3}, S{2, 3, }:L[P{1,2,}(w)]=[q12L[P{2}(w)]+1sp12]λ1s+λ1+λ2+[q21L[P{1}(w)]+1sp21]λ2s+λ1+λ2=λ1λ1+λ21s−q121s+λ2+(λ2λ1+λ2−p12)×1s+λ1+λ2+λ2λ1+λ21s−q211s+λ1+(λ1λ1+λ2−p21)1s+λ1+λ2=1s−q211s+λ1−q121s+λ2+(1−p12−p21)1s+λ1+λ2=1s−0.931s+1/50−0.91s+1/60+0.831s+11/300L[P{1,3,}(w)]=1s−0.831s+1/50−0.951s+1/40+0.781s+9/200L[P{2,3,}(w)]=1s−0.871s+1/60−0.81s+1/40+0.671s+5/120Step 3: For 3-component parallel system, we obtainSystem S{1, 2, 3}:L[P{1,2,3}(w)]=[1sq12q13L[P{2,3,}(w)]+p12q13L[P{3}(w)]+p13q12L[P{2}(w)]+1sp12p13]λ1s+λ1+λ2+λ3+[1sq21q23L[P{1,3,}(w)]+p21q23L[P{3}(w)]+p23q21L[P{1}(w)]+1sp21p23]λ2s+λ1+λ2+λ3+[1sq31q32L[P{1,2,}(w)]+p31q32L[P{2}(w)]+p32q31L[P{1}(w)]+1sp31p32]λ3s+λ1+λ2+λ3=1s−0.789s+1/50−0.794s+1/40−0.772s+1/60+0.599s+9/200+0.580s+11/300+0.573s+5/120−0.398s+37/600Step 4: Taking Inverse Laplace Transformation, we getP{1,2,3}(w)=1−0.789e−w/50−0.794e−w/40−0.772e−w/60+0.599e−(9/200)w+0.580e−(11/300)w+0.573e−(5/120)w−0.398e−(37/600)w
