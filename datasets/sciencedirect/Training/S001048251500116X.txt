@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The pulmonary acinus is a gas exchange unit that is located distal to the terminal bronchioles and consists of a complex microstructure of ducts and alveoli [1–3]. The mechanical phenomena at the acinus level, i.e., acinar flow, gas diffusion, particle depositions, or mechanical responses of lung parenchyma to stretches, underlie the physiological behavior of the lungs. A detailed understanding of the pulmonary acinus is required for recent developments in medical engineering techniques, e.g., pulmonary drug delivery [4,5] or mechanical ventilation protocols [6,7].To date, pulmonary researchers have investigated acinus phenomena using theoretical and numerical approaches [8–15]. The structure model of the acinus (i.e., the shape and size of the alveoli and the patterns of the ductal tree) affects and restricts the numerical results, and hence the choice of structure model is important. Various image-based [16,17] and mathematical models [11,18–21] have been proposed. Image-based models represent part of the real acinus structure, but are sensitive to the image resolution and segmentation algorithm. Hence, their application to numerical analysis is still restricted. In contrast, mathematical models can easily mimic general characteristics of the acinus structure. Two types of models are frequently used for further numerical analysis. The first type is composed of straight tubes that enable regular sphere caps or polyhedra to coalesce on the side wall (i.e., duct-based model) and is typically used to analyze acinar flows [21]. The second type of model is formed from polyhedra of regular size and shape (i.e., polyhedra-based model) and is used to analyze the mechanical response of lung parenchyma to stretching [22].Conventional models rely on the average morphological characteristics of the acinus structure. Consequently, they are too basic to capture the heterogeneous nature of the alveolar and ductal patterns observed in real acinus structures. Computations using simplified acinus models provide approximated features of mechanical phenomena, but allow only a limited investigation of phenomena related to the heterogeneous nature of the acinus structure. In fact, variations of mechanical phenomena in the lungs (i.e., regional differences [23]) have long been recognized. Advances in mechanobiology mean that the detailed resolution of the strain field in alveolar walls is of great interest to researchers in lung cell mechanics [24]. Considering lung parenchyma mechanics, the pathway for stress transmission from organ to cells or cytoskeletons and vice versa is through the extracellular matrix. The parenchyma architecture i.e., detailed acinus structure, is one of important factors affecting such mechanotransduction [13,25]. The heterogeneity of the acinus structure on acinar flow remains important in biofluidics [21]. Furthermore, the acinus structure segmented from high-resolution CT images has been analyzed to micrometer resolution [26–28], which has the potential to provide quantitative data about the heterogeneity of the acinus structure. Thus, to understand the heterogeneous nature of the acinus structure and its relationship to mechanical phenomena in the lungs, it is vital to develop a parametric heterogeneous acinus structure model and investigate the potential and limitations of the modeling technique.In this paper, we propose a method for generating a heterogeneous acinus structure model composed of alveoli of irregular sizes, shapes, and locations that coalesce into an intricately branched ductal tree. Instead of including all the details of the actual acinus structure, we focus on the gas exchange unit of the 3D space-filling structure, represented by an assemblage of polyhedra. To our knowledge, several groups have developed heterogeneous acinus structure models [29,30], but they have focused on the heterogeneity of the ductal tree. A distinctive feature of our model is that we parametrically and explicitly include the distributions of both alveolar and ductal structures, without significantly departing from the typical polyhedra-based acinus model [18,19]. This is achieved by introducing Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations [31] and simulated annealing optimization [32,33]. The abundance of quantitative and qualitative morphological data about the acinus structure [2,34] allow us to verify our approach by modeling the acinus structure of a rat and comparing the model output with previous results. Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the basic methodology of heterogeneous modeling, present the model setting for the rat acinus structure, and introduce the structural parameters analyzed. Section 3 describes the sensitivity of the average structural parameters to the modeling method, distributions and variations of alveolar and ductal structures, segmentation of the 3D structure, model predictions, and limitations. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the paper.
