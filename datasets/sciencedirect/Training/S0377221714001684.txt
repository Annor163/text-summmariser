@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In DEA, there are two frameworks for efficiency assessment and targeting: the greatest and the least distance framework. The greatest distance framework provides us with the efficient targets that are determined by the farthest projections to the assessed decision making unit via maximization of the p-norm relative to either the strongly efficient frontier or the weakly efficient frontier. Non-radial measures belonging to the class of greatest distance measures are the slacks-based measure (SBM) and the range-adjusted measure (RAM). Whereas these greatest distance measures have traditionally been utilized because of their computational ease, least distance projections are quite often more appropriate than greatest distance projections from the perspective of managers of decision-making units because closer efficient targets may be attained with less effort. In spite of this desirable feature of the least distance framework, the least distance (in) efficiency versions of the additive measure, SBM and RAM do not even satisfy weak monotonicity. In this study, therefore, we introduce and investigate least distance p-norm inefficiency measures that satisfy strong monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier. In order to develop these measures, we extend a free disposable set and introduce a tradeoff set that implements input–output substitutability.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In data envelopment analysis (DEA), mathematical programming is applied to observed input–output data in order not only to assess efficiency performance but also to provide efficient target information for managers of entities such as banks, hospitals and business units. Each entity responsible for transforming multiple inputs to multiple outputs is called a decision-making unit (DMU). In DEA, there are basically two frameworks for efficiency assessment and targeting: the greatest and the least distance framework. The greatest distance framework provides us with the efficient targets that are determined by the farthest projections from the DMU being assessed. Such measures include Tone’s (2001) slacks-based measure (SBM), or equivalently Pastor, Ruiz, and Sirvent’s (1999) enhanced Russell graph measure (ERGM), as well as Cooper, Park, and Pastor’s (1999) range-adjusted measure (RAM). These greatest distance efficiency measures and projections are often used because of their computational ease. However, closest or least distance projections are often more relevant than greatest distance projections from the perspective of managers of private or public entities. This is so because closer efficient targets may be reached with less effort (Aparicio, Ruiz, & Sirvent, 2007; Frei & Harker, 1999; Gonzalez & Alvarez, 2001). In a p-norm (lp-norm) framework, RAM and SBM are considered to be greatest distance 1-norm measures, i.e., they are obtained by maximizing the 1-norm over the strongly efficient frontier E.The purpose of this paper is to provide an axiomatic analysis of least distance inefficiency (or efficiency) measures within a p-norm framework. It is well-known that the standard radial measures of CCR (Charnes, Cooper, & Rhodes, 1978) and BCC (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984) do not satisfy strong monotonicity: a decrease in any input (output) raises (lowers) the value of the efficiency measure, or such a change has the opposite effects on the inefficiency measure. This is due to the fact that the CCR and BCC measures identify targets on the boundary or weakly efficient frontierEW(weakly efficient subset) of the production possibility set T, that is, the one-step procedure of CCR or BCC may identify efficient targets onEW, but not on E, whereE⊆EW. Hence, CCR and BCC require two steps in order to identify an efficient target: measuring the efficiency score in the first step and finding an efficient target on E in the second step. However, these measures are not strongly monotonic.As will be shown in this paper, the least distance (in) efficiency versions of the additive measure, SBM and RAM do not even satisfy weak monotonicity not to mention strong monotonicity. These least distance versions were introduced by Aparicio et al. (2007) and Tone (2010) to set efficient targets but not to define (in) efficiency measures. Somewhat more directly related to the goal of the present research is the Portela, Borges, and Thanassoulis (2003) study, in which a multiplicative nonp-norm objective function is minimized.Briec (1998) proposed the family of least distance inefficiency measures under an arbitrary p-norm,1Briec (1998) refers to his p-norm form(p∈[1,∞])as the Hölder distance function.1p∈[1,∞], and showed that the p-norm least distance efficiency measure is reduced to the CCR measure when p is equal to positive infinity. It follows that Briec’s (1998) inefficiency measure satisfies weak monotonicity, which implies that the inefficiency (efficiency) score does not always decrease when an input (output) decreases or an output (input) increases. His inefficiency measure may find an efficient target on the weakly efficient portion of the boundary, i.e.,EW⧹E. Recently, Aparicio and Pastor (2012) modified Aparicio et al.’s (2007) Euclidean norm (2-norm) model, which is based on mixed integer quadratic programming.Ando, Kai, Maeda, and Sekitani (2012) showed that there does not exist any least distance p-norm measure that satisfies weak monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier, and presented a weakly monotonic least distance measure with the incorporation of a free disposable set (or reverse domination cone). The free disposable set is constructed under the assumption of non-substitutable inputs and outputs. In this paper, we extend the free disposable set and develop what we call the tradeoff set, which allows for input–output substitutability. The exploitation of the tradeoff set helps us develop least distance p-norm inefficiency measures that satisfy not only strong monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier, but also some other desirable properties.Now let us clarify where our research stands in the axiomatic efficiency measurement literature. This literature starts with Färe and Lovell (1978), who provided three fundamental axioms: input-indication, input-homogeneity and strong monotonicity in inputs. Input-indication shows that an efficiency measure takes a value of one if and only if the input vector is Koopmans input-efficient given a fixed level of outputs, and input-homogeneity shows doubling all inputs leads to the halving of the efficiency score. Strong monotonicity in inputs indicates that an increase in one or more inputs, while holding outputs constant, leads to a decrease in the efficiency score.Färe, Lovell, and Zieschang (1983) showed that the input-oriented Russell measure introduced by Färe and Lovell (1978) does not satisfy input-homogeneity.2Färe et al. (1983) showed that the input-oriented Russell measure satisfies sub-homogeneity in inputs, which is weaker than input-homogeneity. See also Russell (1985).2Russell (1985) showed that this measure is not strongly monotonic in inputs (see also Russell & Schworm, 2009). Bol (1986) concluded that there does not exist any efficiency measure that satisfies the Färe–Lovell axioms for all general technologies. In respond to these theoretical findings, Dmitruk and Koshevoy (1991) provided a framework that satisfies all the Färe–Lovell axioms, by relaxing some axioms of the input requirement set representing industry technology.Input-homogeneity is closely related to input-oriented radial measures. Since the radial measures fail to satisfy input-indication, the current study focuses on the nonradial measures, which allow nonproportional reductions in inputs and augmentations in outputs. Moreover, due to the nonexistence of efficiency measures satisfying all the Färe–Lovell axioms, we relax the axioms by eliminating input-homogeneity and develop strongly monotonic efficiency measures in a least distance p-norm DEA framework.Two of the obvious extensions to the least distance DEA class are the 1-norm least distance-based SBM and RAM. However, as stated in the introduction, these least distance versions fail to satisfy strong monotonicity. Baek and Lee (2009) proposed a weighted Euclidean (2-norm) distance-based RAM and claimed that it satisfies strong monotonicity. Despite Baek and Lee’s (2009) assertion, Pastor and Aparicio (2010) showed that this measure is not even weakly monotonic. Recently, Ando et al. (2012) showed that strong monotonicity does not hold in the standard least distance framework for anyp∈[1,∞], and then proposed a weakly monotonic least distance measure with the introduction of the free disposal set without resorting to Dmitruk and Koshevoy’s framework. But this modified measure is not strongly monotonic as will be shown in this paper. Therefore, the current study develops a strongly monotonic least distance measure within a p-norm framework.The structure of this paper is as follows. In Section 2.1, we provide the basics and discuss some limitations of previous research contributions. Section 2.2 formally defines the p-norm and its general least distance p-norm measure and Section 2.3 discusses Ando et al.’s (2012) measure and its implications. Section 3 provides our proposed framework. Section 3.1 introduces the tradeoff set and provides the meaning associated with input–output substitutability. In Section 3.2, we develop a least distance inefficiency measure that satisfies three desirable properties including strong monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier. Section 4 shows that the developed p-norm measures satisfy the unit invariance property and the translation invariance property as well. The final section concludes with a summary and some possible future directions of research. All the proofs are relegated to Appendix A.LetR+nandR++nbe the n-dimensional nonnegative and positive Euclidean orthants, respectively. We assume that there are J decision-making units (DMUs), eachDMUj(j=1,…,J)of which transforms an N-dimensional row vector of inputsxj∈R+Ninto an M-dimensional row vector of outputsyj∈R+M. In this paper we use the notationA≡Bto define A by B. The production technology available to the DMUs is characterized by the production possibility set:(1)T≡(x,y)∈R+N+Mxcanproducey,which satisfies free disposability, convexity and minimum extrapolation. In this research, we utilize a variable returns to scale DEA representation of T. The variable returns to scale reference technology is defined by(2)Tv≡(x,y)∈R+N+M∑j=1Jxjλj⩽x,∑j=1Jyjλj⩾y,∑j=1Jλj=1,λ⩾0,whereλis a J-dimensional nonnegative vector and0is a zero vector with appropriate dimension. The restriction∑j=1Jλj=1allows for variable returns to scale. We now assume that all observations are positive and introduce the definitions of the weakly and the strongly efficient frontier.Definition 1The weakly efficient frontier or boundary of (1) is defined by(3)EW≡{(x,y)∈T|(x′,-y′)<(x,-y)⇒(x′,y′)∉T}.Here, for two vectorsw=(w1,…,wn),v=(v1,…,vn), the notationw<vmeans thatwi<vifor all i, andw⩽vmeans thatwi⩽vifor all i.The weakly efficient frontier is the set of all the inputs and outputs that are not strongly dominated.The strongly efficient frontier of (1) is defined by(4)E≡(x,y)∈T(x′,-y′)⩽(x,-y)(x′,-y′)≠(x,-y)⇒(x′,y′)∉T.Note that the strongly efficient frontier (4) can be enumerated by, for example, the method proposed by Fukuyama and Sekitani (2012a). Consider a real-valued functionf(x,y)defined on T that gives an inefficiency measure. The desirable properties thatf(x,y)should have are expressed as follows:Axiom A:(x,y)∈Eif and only iff(x,y)=0.Axiom B:For any(x,y)∈T,0⩽f(x,y).Axiom C:For(xa,ya)∈Tand(xb,yb)∈T,(xa,-ya)⩾(xb,-yb)and(xa,-ya)≠(xb,-yb)implyf(xa,ya)>f(xb,yb).A standard efficiency/inefficiency measure is a farthest distance-based one, but a least distance-based measure3For the least distance efficiency measurement, see Briec (1998), Coelli (1998) and Frei and Harker (1999).3is an alternative to identifying the closest target onEWor E. For some other least distance-based measures, see Baek and Lee (2009), Briec (1998), Aparicio et al. (2007), Takeda and Nishino (2001). We formulate inefficiency measures with respect to the p-norm‖z‖pas follows:(5)‖z‖p≡∑l=1n|zl|p1/pifp∈[1,∞),max{|z1|,…,|zn|}ifp=∞.Considering (5), we define a general least distance p-norm measure4Relative to the weakly efficient frontier (rather than the strongly efficient frontier), Briec (1998) defined a p-norm inefficiency measure asfBriecp(x,y)≡minx′,y′{∥(x,y)-(x′,y′)∥p|(x′,y′)∈EW}.4by(6)fp(x,y)≡min{∥(x,y)-(x′,y′)∥p|(x′,y′)∈E},which is an inefficiency measure that identifies the closest point on E from an activity(x,y)∈T. In fact, incorporating a certain diagonal matrix Z intof2(x,y), Baek and Lee (2009) developed an efficiency measure(7)1-min{‖(x-x′,y-y′)Z‖2|(x′,y′)∈E},and asserted that the second term in (7),(8)min{∥(x-x′,y-y′)Z∥2|(x′,y′)∈E},satisfies strong monotonicity (Axioms A, B and C). However, Pastor and Aparicio (2010) provided a counterexample to Baek and Lee’s (2009) assertion on strong monotonicity and presented an open problem on whether there exists a strongly monotonic efficiency model that yields closest points over the strongly efficient frontier E. That is, their open problem on the p-norm is whether for any T (without assuming a particular returns to scale) there exists ap∈[1,∞]such thatfp(x,y)satisfies Axiom C.Using a two-input one-output illustrative data set in Table 1, Ando et al. (2012) showed thatfp(x4,y4)<fp(x3,y3)while(x3,-y3)⩽(x4,-y4). The strict inequality holds for allp∈[1,+∞]. This gives the following theorem.Theorem 1Ando et al. (2012), Proposition 2.1For anyp∈[1,∞], the p-norm measurefp(x,y)denoted by(6)is neither strongly nor weakly monotonic over the strongly efficient frontier.Consider the following axiom (AxiomC′) which relaxes Axiom C.AxiomC′: For(xa,ya)∈Tand(xb,yb)∈T,(xa,-ya)⩾(xb,-yb)impliesf(xa,ya)⩾f(xb,yb).The measurefp(x,y), satisfying Axioms A, B andC′, is called weakly monotonic over E. Table 1 also gives a negative answer to the existence question offp(x,y)with weak monotonicity over E.In the counterexample provided by Ando et al. (2012), the candidates for least distance efficient targets are the strongly efficient frontier as a whole. On the other hand, the least distance efficient targets of SBM, RAM and the additive measure are confined to a part of the strongly efficient frontier, because the associated projections are obtained only by reducing some inputs and/or increasing outputs. In other words, for(x,y)∈T, the projections of SBM, RAM and the additive measure are always located on{(x′,y′)|(x′,-y′)⩽(x,-y)}∩E. Using the data given in Table 1, Ando et al. (2012) showed that such a confinement of solutions does not lead to the monotonicity of least distance inefficiency measures.Consider(9)f⩾p(x,y)≡min{∥(x,y)-(x′,y′)∥p|(x′,y′)∈E,(x,-y)⩾(x′,-y′)},which is the least distance inefficiency measure (6)with the addition of the condition(x,-y)⩾(x′,-y′). Applying(9)to DMU3and DMU4,Ando et al. (2012)showed thatf⩾p(x4,y4)<f⩾p(x3,y3). As the consequence, we have the following theorem.Theorem 2Ando et al. (2012), Proposition 2.2For anyp∈[1,∞], the least distance p-norm measuref⩾p(x,y)denoted by(9)is neither strongly nor weakly monotonic over the strongly efficient frontier.To cope with the undesired results shown in Theorems 1 and 2, Ando et al. (2012) developed a least distance inefficiency measure satisfying weak monotonicity over E by modifying (6) as follows:(10)f¯p(x,y)≡min{‖(x¯,y¯)-(x′,y′)‖p|(x′,y′)∈E,(x¯,y¯)∈D(x,y)},where(11)D(x,y)≡{(x¯,y¯)|(x¯,-y¯)⩾(x,-y)}.The situation, where an activity(x¯,y¯)belongs toD(x,y), means from(x,y)∈Tthatx¯can producey¯. Hence,D(x,y)represents a free disposable set or reverse domination cone of an activity(x,y)∈T. Free input–output disposability5The idea of free input disposability is that while the firm has to purchase additional inputs it throws away, it does not have to pay anyone to dispose of them. Similarly, the idea of free output disposability is that while the firm can sell part or all of the produced outputs, it does not have to pay for reducing the outputs. Note that free input–output disposability implies that the production possibility set is unbounded and it is possible to dispose of all outputs (possibility of inaction).5indicates that, if the vector(x,y)is technologically feasible, then all input–output vectors inD(x,y)are feasible. In our modeling, we distinguish between the industry technology and DMU (firm) specific technologies. To be more precise, we assume that the industry technology is represented by the production possibility set (2) where inputs and outputs are substitutable, but the industry technology is not accessible without efforts or costs to an inefficient DMU, which operates using its own technology (DMU specific technology). Due to the free disposability assumption, however, theDMU′sown technology is readily and freely available to any activities inD(x,y)in the sense that the movement from(x,y)to(x¯,y¯)∈D(x,y)does not require any change of the DMU specific technology.Note that, whereas the industry technology allows for substitutability between inputs and outputs, the DMU specific technology represented byD(x,y)can be thought of as the Leontief or fixed proportion (non-substitutable) technology (Gould & Ferguson, 1980; Hougaard & Keiding, 1998). The assumptions related to the industry technology and DMU specific technologies are utilized to justify the model (10) as will be explained after the following theorem.Theorem 3(Ando et al., 2012). The measuref¯p, defined in(10), is weakly monotonic over E for allp∈[1,∞].Ando et al. (2012) showed that Theorems 1–3 hold not only for the variable and the constant returns to scale technology, but also for the non-increasing and the non-decreasing technology.Now let us devote a litter more space to discussing the measuref¯p(x,y)and the optimal path from(x,y)to(x′,y′)∈Evia(x¯,y¯)∈D(x,y). In the definition off¯p(x,y), the entire path is decomposed into two sub-paths,(x,y)→(x¯,y¯)and(x¯,y¯)→(x′,y′), where(x¯,y¯)is an intermediate activity inD(x,y). Based on the two sub-paths, the inefficiency measure was decomposed into the following distances:‖(x,y)-(x¯,y¯)‖p…distancefrom(x,y)to(x¯,y¯),‖(x¯,y¯)-(x′,y′)‖p…distancefrom(x¯,y¯)to(x′,y′).In this setting, there are two kinds of costs incurred to the evaluated DMU(x,y): one is associated with the distance‖(x,y)-(x¯,y¯)‖pand the other is with the distance‖(x¯,y¯)-(x′,y′)‖p. Assuming that each cost is proportional to the respective distance, we introduce the parameters,a∈[0,1]andb∈[0,1], which represent the unit costs of the former and the latter distance, respectively. Alternatively speaking, the parameter a is the unit cost associated with the inefficiency of the DMU that is gauged relative to the DMU specific technology, and the parameter b is the unit cost required for the DMU to acquire or adopt the industry technology. Therefore, the total cost to move along the path(x,y)→(x¯,y¯)→(x′,y′)is represented by(12)a∥(x,y)-(x¯,y¯)∥p+b∥(x¯,y¯)-(x′,y′)∥pand the total cost minimization problem is written as(13)min{a∥(x,y)-(x¯,y¯)∥p+b∥(x¯,y¯)-(x′,y′)∥p|(x′,y′)∈E,(x¯,y¯)∈D(x,y)}.Since the movement from(x,y)to(x¯,y¯)does not require any change in the DMU specific technology (because these vectors are members of the free disposable setD(x,y)), we assume that the cost associated with this change is zero. Hence, settinga=0, the total cost minimization problem (13) becomes(14)min{b∥(x¯,y¯)-(x′,y′)∥p|(x′,y′)∈E,(x¯,y¯)∈D(x,y)}.Therefore, the inefficiency score provided by the model (10) has a cost interpretation6Note that, since increasing inputs (for example, hiring more workers) is usually related to additional non-zero costs,a>0is a technologically feasible scenario.6of adopting the industry technology.We illustrate the relationship betweenf¯p(x,y)and the corresponding path using the data given in Table 1 and Fig. 1. The DMUs,(x1,y1)and(x2,y2), are strongly efficient and hence the strongly efficient frontier ofTvis described by(15)E={λ1(x1,y1)+λ2(x2,y2)|λ1+λ2=1,λ1,λ2⩾0}.Taking this result into account, we can obtain the following.f¯p(2,4,10)=min‖(x¯1-(λ1+5λ2),x¯2-(λ1+5λ2),y¯1-(10λ1+10.5λ2))‖pλ1+λ2=1,λ1,λ2⩾0x¯1⩾2,x¯2⩾4,y¯1⩽10⩽‖(4,4,10)-(4,4,10.375)‖p=0.375=0×‖(2,4,10)-(4,4,10)‖p+‖(4,4,10)-(4,4,10.375)‖p,f¯p(5,5,10)=min‖(x¯1-(λ1+5λ2),x¯2-(λ1+5λ2),y¯1-(10λ1+10.5λ2))‖pλ1+λ2=1,λ1,λ2⩾0x¯1⩾5,x¯2⩾5,y¯1⩽10⩾min‖(x¯1-(λ1+5λ2),x¯2-(λ1+5λ2),y¯1-(10λ1+10.5λ2))‖∞λ1+λ2=1,λ1,λ2⩾0x¯1⩾5,x¯2⩾5,y¯1⩽10=minmax|x¯1-(λ1+5λ2)|,|x¯2-(λ1+5λ2)|,|y¯1-(10λ1+10.5λ2)|λ1+λ2=1,λ1,λ2⩾0x¯1⩾5,x¯2⩾5,y¯1⩽10=minmax|x¯1-(λ1+5λ2)|,|y¯1-(10λ1+10.5λ2)|λ1+λ2=1,λ1,λ2⩾0x¯1⩾5,y¯1⩽10=minmaxx¯1-(λ1+5λ2),(10λ1+10.5λ2)-y¯1λ1+λ2=1,λ1,λ2⩾0x¯1⩾5,y¯1⩽10=minmax5-(λ1+5λ2),(10λ1+10.5λ2)-10λ1+λ2=1,λ1,λ2⩾0=min{max{4λ1,0.5-0.5λ1}|0⩽λ1⩽1}=49=(5,5,10)-419,419,949∞.For an arbitraryp∈[1,∞], the above results yieldf¯p(2,4,10)⩽0×‖(2,4,10)-(4,4,10)‖p+‖(4,4,10)-(4,4,10.375)‖p=0.375<49=f¯∞(5,5,10)=(5,5,10)-419,419,949∞⩽f¯p(5,5,10).We thus have confirmed that Axiom C does not fail for thef¯p(x,y)case. By contrast, Ando et al. (2012) showed that the measurefp(x,y)does not satisfy monotonicity with respect to DMU3 and DMU4.The entire path for DMU4 in thep=1case is(5,5,10)→(5,5,10.5)and Ando et al.’s measure isf¯1(5,5,10)=0.5. See Appendix B for the calculation off¯1(5,5,10). See also Table C2 of Appendix C. In Fig. 1, DMU4 has only a solid line with an arrow, because its entire path is equivalent to the sub-path(5,5,10)→(5,5,10.5). Clearly, if one writes the optimal solution of (10) for DMU4 as(x′∗,y′∗,x¯∗,y¯∗)where(x′∗,y′∗)∈Eand(x¯∗,y¯∗)∈D(x,y), then we have(x¯∗,y¯∗)=(5,5,10)=(x,y).The entire path for DMU3 in thep=1case is represented by(2,4,10)→(4,4,10)→(4,4,10.375). But, since we assume that the cost associated with the sub-path from(2,4,10)to(4,4,10)is zero, the total cost stems from the cost associated with the sub-path from(4,4,10)to(4,4,10.375)alone. In Fig. 1, the sub-paths(2,4,10)→(4,4,10)and(4,4,10)→(4,4,10.375)for DMU3 are shown by dotted and solid lines, respectively. Table C1 of Appendix C shows that Ando et al.’s inefficiency score is 0.375, i.e.,f¯1(2,4,10)=0.375.In thep=+∞case, the entire path for DMU4 turns out to be equivalent to the single sub-path,(5,5,10)→(419,419,949), which does not pass through any intermediate point in the free disposable set. This implies that the minimum distance is computed directly by the distance from the evaluated DMU to the strongly efficient target. Therefore, the total cost for DMU4 is given by the distance between(5,5,10)and419,419,949.Regarding the sub-path(x¯∗,y¯∗)→(x′∗,y′∗), we in general have(x¯∗,-y¯∗)⩾(x′∗,-y′∗)as is shown below:Proposition 1For a givenp∈[1,∞), any optimal solution(x′∗,y′∗,x¯∗,y¯∗)of(10)with(x′∗,y′∗)∈Eand(x¯∗,y¯∗)∈D(x,y)satisfies(x′∗,-y′∗)⩽(x¯∗,-y¯∗). Moreover, ifp=∞, then there exists an optimal solution(x′∗,y′∗,x¯∗,y¯∗)of(10)with(x′∗,y′∗)∈Eand(x¯∗,y¯∗)∈D(x,y)such that(x′∗,-y′∗)⩽(x¯∗,-y¯∗).Proposition 1 states that, for anyp∈[1,∞], not only the optimal projection point(x′∗,y′∗)of (10) is strongly efficient, but also the vector(x¯∗,y¯∗)is a member of the free disposal setD(x,y)and satisfies(x′∗,-y′∗)⩽(x¯∗,-y¯∗). On the other hand, Lemma 1(2) and Lemma 2 of Briec (1998) indicate that an optimal solution of his model is only associated with the weakly efficient projection point.Next, we show thatf¯p(x,y)is not necessarily strongly monotonic for an arbitrary normp∈[1,∞], with the use of the data provided in Table 1. Choose an arbitrary p-norm (p∈[1,∞]) and considerf¯p(x3,y3). There exist vectors(x′∗,y′∗)∈Eand(xp,yp)∈D(x3,y3)such thatf¯p(x3,y3)=‖(xp,yp)-(x′∗,y′∗)‖pSincefp(x4,y4)<fp(x3,y3), we havefp(x3,y3)>fp(x4,y4)⩾f¯p(x4,y4)⩾f¯p(x3,y3).This means that(x3,y3)≠(xp,yp)∈D(x3,y3). By the definition ofD(x,y), we have(xp,-yp)⩾(x3,-y3). The weak monotonicity off¯pyieldsf¯p(xp,yp)⩾f¯p(x3,y3)=‖(xp,yp)-(x′∗,y′∗)‖p⩾f¯p(xp,yp)and hence we havef¯p(x3,y3)=f¯p(xp,yp). However, since(xp,-yp)⩾(x3,-y3)and(x3,y3)≠(xp,yp), the measuref¯pdoes not satisfy strong monotonicity with respect to the two points(x3,y3)and(xp,yp).Proposition 2There exists an input–output data where strong monotonicity over E is not satisfied by the family off¯p(x,y)with anyp⩾1.According to Proposition 2, Ando et al.’s measure (10) is weakly monotonic but is not strongly monotonic over the efficient frontier.This study extends the model (10) to a least distance framework, in which strong monotonicity is satisfied, i.e., all of Axioms A, B and C are satisfied. For this purpose, we replaceD(x,y)of (10) byDε(x,y), which is defined by(16)Dε(x,y)≡(x¯,y¯)(x¯,y¯)=(x+dx,y-dy)0⩽(dx,dy)I(ε),where7To our knowledge, the positive definite matrixI(ε)was first utilized in DEA efficiency measurement in Fukuyama and Sekitani’s article entitled “Efficiency measurement in an enhanced DEA framework” (proceedings of DEA symposium 2009 held on January 13–15 in Osaka). The article was an early version of Fukuyama and Sekitani (2012b).7(17)I(ε)≡1ε⋯εε1⋱⋮⋮⋱⋱εε⋯ε1is a symmetric positive definite matrix for a given nonnegative value ofε. We callDε(x,y)the tradeoff set of(x,y). The tradeoff set extendsD(x,y)with the incorporation of the coefficientε. We introduce(18)fεp(x,y)≡min{‖(x¯,y¯)-(x′,y′)‖p|(x′,y′)∈E,(x¯,y¯)∈Dε(x,y)}.Ifε=0, thenD0(x,y)=D(x,y)andf0p(x,y)=f¯p(x,y). The proposed measurefεp(x,y)is a natural extension of (10). Therefore,fεp(x,y)can be interpreted as the cost minimization problem (14). That is, ifDε(x,y)represents the DMU specific technology, then the proposed measure (18) collapses to (13) in the case ofa=0andb=1.Next, we explain how the tradeoff set and shadow prices in dual space are related toε. For this purpose, we define the following set of allowable multiplier weights (shadow prices):(19)Ω(ε)≡(v,w)vn⩾ε1+(N+M-1)ε,n=1,…,Nwm⩾ε1+(N+M-1)ε,m=1,…,M∑n=1Nvn+∑m=1Mwm=1.From the definition ofΩ(ε), we can see that each component of(v,w)in (19) is positive. The following proposition establishes an equivalence relationship betweenDε(x,y)andΩ(ε). The superscript t stands for the transpose of a vector or a matrix.Proposition 3Assumeε∈(0,1). Then we have(x¯,y¯)∈Dε(x,y)⇔vx¯t-wy¯t⩾vxt-wyt∀(v,w)∈Ω(ε).The free disposable setD(x,y)represents a fixed proportion technology for(x,y). Since(x¯,y¯)∈D(x,y)⇔(x¯,-y¯)⩾(x,-y), the condition(x¯,-y¯)⩾(x,-y)can equivalently be expressed in terms of multiplier weights(v,w):(20)vx¯t-wy¯t⩾vxt-wyt∀(v,w)∈{e1,…,eN+M}.The vector(v,w)in (20) is arbitrarily chosen from the vectorse1,…,eN+M. Hereei(i=1,…,N+M)is the ith unit vector, i.e., its ith element is unity and all the others are zero. That is, there is no input–output substitutable relationship for(x¯,y¯)∈D(x,y), whereD(x,y)represents a non-substitutable technology for the activity(x,y)∈T.Givenε>0, the setDε(x,y)represents the DMU specific technology of(x,y)under the assumption of substitutable inputs and outputs. We explainDε(x,y)in detail as follows. The expression∀(v,w)∈Ω(ε)indicates that all elements of the vector(v,w)inΩ(ε)are strictly positive. The inequalityvx¯t-wy¯t⩾vxt-wyt∀(v,w)∈Ω(ε)indicates that there is substitutability between inputs and outputs. Therefore, implementing{(x¯,y¯)|vx¯t-wy¯t⩾vxt-wyt∀(v,w)∈Ω(ε)}is equivalent to assuming substitutable input–output relationships. Since Proposition 3 means that we can writeDε(x,y)as{(x¯,y¯)|vx¯t-wy¯t⩾vxt-wyt∀(v,w)∈Ω(ε)}, the setDε(x,y)is the DMU specific technology, in which the evaluated DMU(x,y)realizes substitutable input–output relationships. Due to this fact, we have calledDε(x,y)the tradeoff set in the present paper.Now a question arises: how can we constructΩ(ε)in practice? It is important to construct it by avoiding the possibility that the setΩ(ε)includes the substitutable input–output relations for any strongly efficient DMU. Consequently, we assume thatΩ(ε)satisfies the condition that, for all(x,y)∈E, there exists(v,w)∈Ω(ε)such thatvxt-wyt⩽min{vx¯t-wy¯t|(x¯,y¯)∈T}.At this point, it is worthwhile noting that, for any efficient activity(x,y)∈E, there is at least one positive multiplier vector(v,w)satisfyingvx¯t-wy¯t⩾vxt-wyt∀(x¯,y¯)∈T. Furthermore, since the strongly efficient frontier is equivalent to the union of finitely many faces, we can limit to finitely many positive multiplier vectors for each efficient activity. It follows that, for a sufficiently smallε>0, the non-emptiness ofΩ(ε)is guaranteed. For any efficient activity(x,y)∈E, there is at least one positive multiplier vector(v¯,w¯)such thatv¯xt-w¯yt=min{v¯x¯t-w¯y¯t|(x¯,y¯)∈T}. That is, the setΩ(ε)contains information on multipliers enough to describe the strongly efficient frontier E.Consider two cones,D(x,y)andDε(x,y), which translate the origin to(x,y). We can show that the two cones have the following relationship:(21)(xˆ,yˆ)∈D(x,y)⧹{(x,y)}⇒Dε(xˆ,yˆ)⊆intDε(x,y)for any positiveε, where intS is the interior of S.Lemma 1For anyε>0, Eq. (21)holds.Axiom C is guaranteed by the relationship (21) and the following lemmas.Lemma 2Assume(x,y)∈Tand chooseε>0arbitrarily. Let(x¯∗,y¯∗,x′∗,y′∗)be an optimal solution of(18). IfE∩Dε(x,y)=∅orE∩Dε(x,y)={(x,y)}, then(22)(x¯∗,y¯∗)∉intDε(x,y).Assume(x,y)∈Tand chooseε>0arbitrarily. Let(xˆ,yˆ)∈D(x,y)⧹{(x,y)}. IfE∩Dε(x,y)=∅orE∩Dε(x,y)={(x,y)}, then(23)fεp(x,y)<fεp(xˆ,yˆ)for allp∈[1,∞].The inequality (23) means thatfεp(x,y)satisfies strong monotonicity over E under the assumption thatE∩Dε(x,y)⊆{(x,y)}. For anyε∈[0,ε¯), whereε¯is positive, the tradeoff setDε(x,y)should satisfy the following two conditions:(24)(x,y)∈E⇒Dε(x,y)∩E={(x,y)},(25)(x,y)∈T⧹E⇒Dε(x,y)∩E=∅.The existence and choice of the positive valueε¯were discussed by Fukuyama and Sekitani (2012b) in a different context. The existence ofε¯>0guarantees Axiom C as well as Axiom A.For any face F of T, we define(26)VW(F)≡(v,w,u)∑n=1Nvn+∑m=1Mwm=1,v(xj)t-w(yj)t⩾u∀j=1,…,Ju=vxt-wyt∀(x,y)∈F.A face F is called a maximal efficient face ifF⊆Eand a face G withG∩F≠∅andG⊆EimpliesG⊆F. Since E consists of a finite number of maximal efficient faces, we have L maximal efficient faces, sayF1,…,FL, such thatE=∪l=1LFl. For any(x,y)∈Ethere exists an indexl∈{1,…,L}such that(x,y)∈Fl.Consider(x,y)∈T. There exists a vector(v,w,u)∈VW(Fl)such thatvxt-wyt>max{vx¯t-wy¯t|(x¯,y¯)∈Fl}=min{vx¯t-wy¯t|(x¯,y¯)∈Fl}if and only if(x,y)∉Fl. Hence,(x,y)∈T⧹Eif and only if for everyl=1,…,Lthere exists a vector(v,w,u)∈VW(Fl)such thatvxt-wyt>max{vx¯t-wy¯t|(x¯,y¯)∈Fl}=min{vx¯t-wy¯t|(x¯,y¯)∈Fl}. Let(27)η∗=minl=1,…,Lmax(v,w,u)∈VW(Fl)min{v1,…,vN,w1,…,wM}.Since∑n=1Nvn+∑m=1Mwm=1and(v,w)is a nonnegative vector,min{v1,…,vN,w1,…,wM}takes the maximum value atv1=…=vN=w1=…=wM=1/(N+M)and hencemin{v1,…,vN,w1,…,wM}⩽1/(N+M). It follows from this result and the definition of E along with Motzkin’s theorem of the alternative that0<η∗⩽1/(N+M). Let the maximal epsilon be obtained by(28)ε¯=(η∗-1-N-M+1)-1.As a consequence, we have0<ε¯⩽1. In order to further understand the DMU specific technologyDε(x,y), let us consider Table 2, in which there are five DMUs that employ a single input to produce a single output. Fig. 2depicts these DMUs (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5) and the strongly efficient frontier as well asDε(x,y)andD(x,y)under the variable returns to scale assumption. Clearly, there are three efficient faces ({#1,#2}, {#2,#3}, {#3,#4}) and one inefficient DMU labeled #5.Fig. 2 illustrates the relationship betweenD(x,y)andDε(x,y)and howε¯is related to the latter set. Face {#1,#2} gives the minimum value ofηas follows:η∗=minl=1,2,3max(v1,w1,u)∈VW(Fl)min{v1,w1}=0.25, and henceε¯=0.3333.Table 3gives the values ofηandεcorresponding to faces {#1,#2}, {#2,#3} and {#3,#4} as well asε¯. In Fig. 2, any point on the extended line from(x,y)to the northeast direction is technologically equivalent to this input–output bundle. A similar statement applies to any point on the extended line to the southwest direction. In this example, the free disposable setD(x,y)is enlarged to the tradeoff setDε(x,y)in the two directions based on the multipliers information about the face {#1,#2}. To explain the proposed framework8Including this analysis in the manuscript was suggested by one of the reviewers.8further, we present an illustration using Example 1. The results of this example are given in Appendix C.Lemma 4Assume(x,y)∈Tand chooseε∈(0,ε¯)arbitrarily. Let(x¯,y¯)∈Dε(x,y). Then for everyl=1,…,Lthere exists a vector(vl,wl,ul)∈VW(Fl)such that(29)vlx¯t-wly¯t⩾vlxt-wlyt.Moreover,vlx¯t-wly¯t=vlxt-wlytif and only if(x¯,y¯)=(x,y)∈Fl.Assume(x,y)∈Tand chooseε∈(0,ε¯)arbitrarily. If(x,y)∈E, thenDε(x,y)∩E={(x,y)}. If(x,y)∈T⧹E, thenDε(x,y)∩E=∅.Exploiting Lemmas 3–5 leads to the following proposition.Proposition 4Chooseε∈(0,ε¯)andp∈[1,∞]arbitrarily. Then, the proposed measurefεp(x,y)satisfies strong monotonicity over E.Proposition 4 states that the proposed inefficiency measure (18) satisfies strong monotonicity without imposing additional assumptions on the convex DEA (polyhedral) technologies. The measure (18) is a natural extension of Ando et al. (2012), although the simple use of Ando et al.’s (2012) method does not lead to strong monotonicity as Proposition 2 indicates.It should be noted that the optimal projection point obtained from (18) is not equivalent to the one given by Aparicio et al.’s (2007) method. To see this, consider the point (2,4,10) in Fig. 1 and Appendix C. The projection based on Aparicio et al.’s (2007) method is the point (2,2,10.125) on the red line connecting (1,1,10) and (5,5,10.5). By contrast, the path based on (18) is (2,4,10)→(4,4,10)→(4,4,10.375). This shows that the two optimal projections are different. Appendix C also provides a comparison of the result offεp(x,y)and that off¯p(x,y).A real valued function g defined on T is an efficiency measure satisfying a set of axioms:AxiomA″:(x,y)∈Eif and only ifg(x,y)=1.AxiomB″:For any(x,y)∈T,0⩽g(x,y)⩽1.AxiomC″:For(xa,ya)∈Tand(xb,yb)∈T,(xa,-ya)⩾(xb,-yb)and(xa,-ya)≠(xb,-yb)implyg(xa,ya)<g(xb,yb).AxiomsA″,B″andC″are efficiency indication, zero-unity requirement, and monotonicity, respectively.Furthermore, this study considers two more desirable properties for an efficiency measure g. Let us denote by g(x,y:T)the efficiency measure that is defined over the production possibility set T.AxiomD″:For a positive vectorz∈R++N+M, any(x,y)∈Timpliesg(xz,yz:Tz)=g(x,y:T), where(xz,yz)=x1z1,…,xNzN,y1zN+1,…,yMzN+MandTz={(xz,yz)|(x,y)∈T}.AxiomE″:For a positive vectorz∈R++N+M, any(x,y)∈Timpliesg(xz,yz:Tz)=g(x,y:T), where(xz,yz)=(x,y)+zandTz={(x,y)+z|(x,y)∈T}.AxiomsD″andE″represent unit invariance and translation invariance, respectively.Consider the variable returns to scale production possibility setTvin (2) and letI={j|(xj,yj)∈E}. Forz∈R++N+Mletdiag(z)=z10⋯00z2⋱⋮⋮⋱⋱00⋯0zN+M. We defineγmax≡(maxj∈Ix1j,…,maxj∈IxNj,maxj∈Iy1j,…,maxj∈IyMj),γmin≡(minj∈Ix1j,…,minj∈IxNj,minj∈Iy1j,…,minj∈IyMj),Γ≡diag(γmax-γmin)-1ifγmax>γmin.The matrixΓis independent of any perturbation of(xj,yj)forj∈{1,…,J}⧹I, i.e., any change in values of(xj,yj),j∈{1,…,J}⧹I, does not affect the coefficient values ofΓinasmuch as the perturbation occurs insideTv. Therefore,Γis uniquely determined based onTv. For allp∈[1,∞], we define a function(30)gεp(x,y)≡(1+min{‖((x′,y′)-(x¯,y¯))Γ‖p|(x′,y′)∈E,(x¯,y¯)∈Dε(x,y)})-1overTv. The functionfεpis obtained by way of the following minimization problem(31)fεp(x,y)=min{‖((x′,y′)-(x¯,y¯))Γ‖p|(x′,y′)∈E,(x¯,y¯)∈Dε(x,y)},which is an inefficiency measure defined over the set{(x,y)Γ|(x,y)∈T}.An inefficiency measurefpcan be used to obtain the corresponding efficiency measuregpasgp=(1+fp)-1. In fact, the output-oriented SBM, which belongs to the class of farthest distance DEA models, can be written as(32)11+maxM-1∑r=1Mdryyr(x-dx,y+dy)∈Tdx⩾0,dy⩾0=11+max∥(y′-y)diag(My)-1∥1(x-dx,y′)∈Ewdx⩾0,y′⩾y.Therefore,gpbased on (32) is a natural way of transforming the inefficiency measure (31) into an efficiency measure. Note that the output-oriented SBM (32) does not satisfy Axiom E″. On the other hand, the efficiency measuregpdefined by (31) satisfies AxiomsA″toE″as is shown in the following proposition.Proposition 5Suppose thatT=Tvandγmax>γmin. Chooseε∈(0,ε¯)andp∈[1,∞]arbitrarily. Thengεp(x,y)satisfies Axioms A″ to E″.Proposition 5 states that the least distance efficiency measuregεp(x,y)satisfies not only the three desirable properties (Axioms A, B, and C), but also unit invariance and translation invariance. Russell and Schworm (2006) asserted that unit invariance is a fundamental criterion for a desirable efficiency measure. From this point of view, too, the measuregεp(x,y)is a well-defined least distance-based efficiency measure.The present paper has some connection with Fukuyama and Sekitani’s (2012b) study, which was motivated by the studies of Dmitruk and Koshevoy (1991) and Russell and Schworm (2006), but the latter two do not deal with the least distance efficiency measurement. Assuming the existence of full dimensional facets, Aparicio and Pastor (2013) have recently developed an output-oriented strongly monotonic least distance measure. However, there are differences between our proposed p-norm measure and Aparicio and Pastor’s (2013) measure. Aparicio and Pastor (2013) explicitly assumed: (a) that there exist full dimensional facets, and (b) that the projected points can be located on an extended facet portion of the extended frontier. On the other hand, we assume neither the existence of full dimensional facets, nor projections on an extended facet portion. The latter point can be seen with the help of Fig. 3, which is adapted from Fig. 2. Consider the inefficient DMU represented by(ẋ,ẏ)=(15,6). The projections based on Aparicio and Pastor’s (2013) measure and the proposed measurefεpare(15,9)and(12,8), respectively. The projected point offεpis necessarily located on the strongly efficient frontier E but that of Aparicio and Pastor (2013) is not.There was no documented evidence in the scientific DEA literature on the existence of practical least distance p-norm (p∈[1,∞)) measure that satisfies several desirable axioms including strong monotonicity on the strongly efficient frontier, without using extended efficient faces or facets. Introducing DMU (or firm) specific technologies that allow for input–output substitutability, therefore, we have developed a least distance p-norm inefficiency (efficiency) measure satisfying strong monotonicity over the strongly efficient frontier as well as efficiency indication, zero-unity requirement and unit invariance.Ando et al. (2012) obtained weakly monotonic least distance measures under the assumption that DMU specific technologies are represented by the free disposable set, i.e., the Leontief or fixed proportion technology whose specification assumes non-substitutable input–output relationships. For the development of the proposed measures, we extended the free disposable set (or reverse domination cone) and introduced the tradeoff set under the assumption of input–output substitutability. We have shown that the use of the tradeoff set allows us to develop the strongly monotonic class of inefficiency measures.An important difference between the free disposable set and the tradeoff set is that, whereas the use of the former set guarantees only the weak monotonicity of least distance measures, the use of the latter set allows us to construct strongly monotonic least distance measures.It should be noted that the proposed least distance p-norm efficiency measurement framework is easily extendable to its weighted version, in which many of the existing inefficiency and efficiency measures can be analyzed in a unified way. Accordingly, an efficiency measure and the corresponding inefficiency measure can be related to each other within the extended unified framework, as was shown in Section 4.The least distance approach has an important practical merit because it identifies a closest or easy-to-accept efficient target for decision makers. Therefore, it is of great interest to learn the differences and similarities in both the choice of p-norms and the identification of efficient targets through various empirical studies within the proposed framework. We are looking forward to seeing many such applications. It should be noted that one of the theoretical issues needed to be solved is whether or not we can construct (in) efficiency measures that satisfy the continuity property proposed by Russell (1990).
