Influence of snow shovel shaft configuration on lumbosacral biomechanics during a load-lifting task

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
3D L5/S1 angular impulses were measured during a simulated snow shovelling task with two shovel designs.The two designs compared were a bent-shaft shovel and a straight-shaft shovel.L5/S1 extension angular impulses were lower in the bent-shaft condition.This occurred due to reduced extension moment duration, reduced extension moment magnitude and reduced upper body flexion.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Lower-back injury from snow shovelling may be related to excessive joint loading. Bent-shaft snow shovels are commonly available for purchase; however, their influence on lower back-joint loading is currently not known. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare L5/S1 extension angular impulses between a bent-shaft and a standard straight-shaft snow shovel. Eight healthy subjects participated in this study. Each completed a simulated snow-lifting task in a biomechanics laboratory with each shovel design. A standard motion analysis procedure was used to determine L5/S1 angular impulses during each trial, as well as peak L5/S1 extension moments and peak upper body flexion angle. Paired-samples t-tests (α = 0.05) were used to compare variables between shovel designs. Correlation was used to determine the relationship between peak flexion and peak moments. Results of this study show that the bent-shaft snow shovel reduced L5/S1 extension angular impulses by 16.5% (p = 0.022), decreased peak moments by 11.8% (p = 0.044), and peak flexion by 13.0% (p = 0.002) compared to the straight-shaft shovel. Peak L5/S1 extension moment magnitude was correlated with peak upper body flexion angle (r = 0.70). Based on these results, it is concluded that the bent-shaft snow shovel can likely reduce lower-back joint loading during snow shovelling, and thus may have a role in snow shovelling injury prevention.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Nearly 12,000 individuals are treated in U.S. emergency departments each year for snow shovelling-related injuries (Watson et al., 2011). The most common anatomical region for shovelling-related injury is the lower-back. Specifically, a retrospective study has shown that lower-back injuries account for 34.3% of all snow shovelling injuries, and in most cases, the injury is due to musculoskeletal overexertion, affecting soft tissues (Watson et al., 2011). Mechanically, this overexertion may be represented as increased joint loading in the lower-back. Therefore, biomechanical design of an ergonomic shovel that can decrease these joint loads may have implications for low-back injury prevention.Perhaps the most common ergonomic snow shovel that is available for purchase is the bent-shaft shovel, which includes a downward bend in the shovel shaft. Despite the retail of bent-shaft shovels, no scientific evidence exists to support its use in terms of reducing mechanical loading at the lower-back. McGorry et al. (2003) studied bent-shaft shovels from a kinematic perspective, and found that a bent-shaft shovel significantly reduced upper body flexion when compared to the more common straight-shaft shovel. Huang and Paquet (2002) reported similar results. It has been speculated that the decrease in upper body flexion associated with bent-shaft shovel use would also decrease lumbar joint moments (McGorry et al., 2003); however, to the best of our knowledge, no study to date has tested this hypothesis.Although peak joint moments provide an instantaneous indication of the mechanical loads that occur at a joint, they do not provide cumulative load information. For overuse injuries, such as low-back pain, a measure of cumulative loading such as angular impulse (integral of moments with respect to time) may provide more relevant information (Schipplein et al., 1990; Stefanyshyn et al., 2006). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if a bent-shaft shovel influences angular impulses about the L5/S1 joint during a shovelling task. It was hypothesized that L5/S1 extension angular impulses would be decreased with bent-shaft shovel use compared to a straight-shaft snow shovel.
