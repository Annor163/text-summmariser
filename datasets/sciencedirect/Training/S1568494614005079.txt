@&#ABSTRACT@&#
As a fuzzy set extension, the hesitant set is effectively used to model situations where it is allowable to determine several possible membership degrees of an element to a set due to the ambiguity between different values. We first introduce some new operational rules of hesitant fuzzy sets based on the Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm, in which a family of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher operators is proposed for aggregating hesitant fuzzy information. Some basic properties of these proposed operators are given, and the relationships between them are shown in detail. We further discuss the interrelations between the proposed aggregation operators and the existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. Applying the proposed hesitant fuzzy operators, we develop a new technique for hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making problems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is illustrated by mean of a practical example.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Various approaches to multiple criteria decision making require suitable aggregation functions [1–4]. This is particularly important when modeling different kinds of uncertainty using Zadeh's fuzzy set [5] and their higher order extensions, such as the interval-valued fuzzy set [6], intuitionistic fuzzy set [7,8], interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set [9], type-2 fuzzy set [10–12], type-n fuzzy set [10], and fuzzy multiset [12]. In some cases, it is difficult to determinate the degree of membership of an element to a set caused by ambiguity between a few different values. For example, a company may invite many experts to estimate the quality of an alternative with respect to a given criteria. Some experts regard 0.5 as the membership degree of quality, some regard 0.6 as the membership degree of quality, other regard 0.8 as the membership degree of quality. The three experts cannot compromise and change their evaluation. In this case, a simpler method is that the membership degree of quality should be composed of the three possible values. In order to deal with such situations, Torra and Narukawa [13] proposed the concept of the hesitant fuzzy set. For the above example, it can be represented by a hesitant fuzzy set {0.5, 0.6, 0.8}. As another generalized form of a fuzzy set, the hesitant fuzzy set permits several possible membership degrees of an element to a set, so it is an effective tool to represent a decision-maker's hesitancy in expressing his/her preferences.After the pioneering work by Torra and Narukawa [13,14], the hesitant fuzzy set has been received more and more attention from researchers. Recently, it has been successfully applied to deal with uncertain multicriteria decision making problems. The hesitant fuzzy aggregation operator is one of the core issues. Based on some hesitant fuzzy operational rules, Xia and Xu [15] first proposed hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (HFWA), hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric (HFWG) operators, generalized hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (GHFWA), generalized hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric (GHFWG) operators, and applied them in solving decision making problems. Xu and Xia [16] proposed distance and similarity measures for hesitant fuzzy sets, and hesitant ordered weighted distance measures and hesitant ordered weighted similarity measures were investigated. The distance and correlation measures were further discussed for hesitant fuzzy information [17]. Extending quasi-arithmetic means to hesitant fuzzy sets, Xia et al. [18] proposed several new hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators for group decision making under hesitant fuzzy situations. Wei [19] extended the prioritized aggregation operator [20,21] to hesitant fuzzy sets, and developed some prioritized hesitant fuzzy operators for multicriteria decision making. According to the geometric Bonferroni mean, Zhu et al. [22] proposed a series of hesitant fuzzy geometric Bonferroni operators, such as the hesitant fuzzy Choquet geometric Bonferroni mean, the weighted hesitant fuzzy geometric Bonferroni mean and the weighted hesitant fuzzy Choquet geometric Bonferroni mean operators, for multicriteria decision making problems with hesitant fuzzy information. Based on the hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (HFWA) operator, Gu et al. [23] proposed a hesitant fuzzy multiple attribute decision making method to investigate risk investment problem. Wei et al. [24] extended the Chouquet integral to hesitant fuzzy sets, and proposed some hesitant fuzzy Choquet operators, such as the hesitant fuzzy Choquet ordered averaging and hesitant fuzzy Choquet ordered geometric operator, for interactive multicriteria decision making. A generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid weighted distance measure was proposed by Wang et al. [25] to evaluate governmental archives website's construction. Zhang [26] developed a family of hesitant fuzzy power aggregation operators, for example the hesitant fuzzy power weighted average (HFPWA), hesitant fuzzy power weighted geometric (HFPWG), generalized hesitant fuzzy power weighted average (GHFPWA), generalized hesitant fuzzy power weighted geometric (GHFPWG) operators, and applied them to handle hesitant fuzzy multicriteria group decision making problems. A generalized hesitant fuzzy synergetic weighted distance measure was presented by Peng et al. [27] for multiple criteria decision making. Based on TOPSIS and maximizing the deviation method, Xu and Zhang [28] proposed a new approach for the hesitant fuzzy MCDM with incomplete weight information. Zhang and Wei [29] developed the E-VIKOR method and TOPSIS method to solve MCDM problems with hesitant fuzzy set information. Based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets and context-free grammar, Rodriguez et al. [30,31] proposed a new linguistic group decision model that facilitated the elicitation of flexible and rich linguistic expressions. By means of the extending hesitant fuzzy set by the intuitionistic fuzzy set, Qian et al. [32] proposed a generalized hesitant fuzzy set, and applied it to decision support systems.It is worthwhile to mention that these existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators, such as the HFWA, HFWG, GHFWA, GHFWG, HFPWA, HFPWG, GHFPWA, and GHFPWG operators, are based on the algebraic product and algebraic sum operational rules of hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs), which are a pair of special dual triangular norm (briefly t-norm) and triangular conorm (briefly t-conorm) [3]. In the light of the relation between the intuitionistic fuzzy set and hesitant fuzzy set, general t-norm and t-conorm can be used to model the intersection and union of HFEs. That is to say, by means of t-conorm and t-norm, the above hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators are capable of being improved. For the intuitionistic fuzzy set, Beliakov et al. [33] constructed some operations about intuitionistic fuzzy sets based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm, and further extended generalized Bonferroni mean [34] to intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and proposed the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy Bonferroni operators [35]. Xia et al. [36] gave some operations of intuitionistic fuzzy sets based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm, and proposed an Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm based intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator, and an Archimedean t-cornorm and t-norm based the intuitionistic fuzzy geometric operator. Yu [37] proposed a generalized intuitionistic fuzzy prioritized weighted geometric operator based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm. Tan et al. [38] extended the quasi-OWA operator to the intuitionistic fuzzy set using Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm. However, these operators didn’t consider the order weight and hybrid weight (i.e., integrating the attribute weight and the order weight), and they cannot be applied to HFEs, too. By means of another pair of special t-conorm and dual t-norm, the Einstein sum and Einstein product, Wang and Liu [39,40] proposed a wide range of intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein aggregation operators, such as the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted geometric (IFEWG) operator, the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted geometric (IFEOWG) operator, the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted averaging (IFEWA) operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted averaging (IFEOWA) operator. According to the Einstein t-conorm and t-norm, Zhao and Wei [41] proposed some intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid Einstein aggregation operators for intuitionistic fuzzy multicriteria decision making. Yu [42] extended the Einstein t-conorm and t-norm to hesitant fuzzy sets, and proposed some hesitant fuzzy Einstein aggregation operators. Hamacher [43] proposed another kind of t-conorm and t-norm, called the Hamacher t-conorm and t-norm. As a generalization of the algebraic product and sum, and Einstein t-conorm and t-norm, the Hamacher t-conorm and t-norm is more general and more flexible [43]. In this paper, we extend the Hamacher t-conorm and t-norm to hesitant fuzzy set and propose a family of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher operators that allow decision-makers have more choice in multiple criteria decision making problems. It is also very important to research generalized hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators based on the Hamacher t-conorm and t-norm and their application to multicriteria decision making.In order to do so, the paper will be set out as follows: In Section 2, some basic concepts of some aggregation operators, including t-norm and t-conorm, and hesitant fuzzy sets, are briefly reviewed. Some new hesitant fuzzy operational rules are introduced based on the Hamacher t-conorm and t-norm. In Section 3, based on these new Hamacher operational rules on hesitant fuzzy sets, we present a wide range of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy information, some of their desirable properties are investigated in detail, and the interrelations between the various operators are discussed. Further, we compare the proposed operators with the existing some hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators and obtain the corresponding relations. In Section 4, applying these proposed operators, we develop a technique for hesitant fuzzy multicriteria decision making. In Section 5, an example application of the new technique is provided, and we compare the developed method with the existing methods. In Section 6, we discuss the conclusions.Aggregation functions are used to combine a set of input values into a single representative output.Definition 1 (Aggregation operator[2,34]). An aggregation function f: [0,1]n→ [0,1] is a function non-decreasing in each argument and satisfying f (0, …, 0)=0 and f (1, …, 1)=1.The dual of an aggregation function can be expressed using the standard negation N(t)=1−t and is denoted byfD(x1, …, xn)=N(f (N(x1), …, N(xn))).Definition 2 (GWA operator[44]). A mapping f: [0,1]n→ [0,1] is called a generalized weighted averaging (GWA) operator of n-dimension iffx1,x2,⋯,xn=∑i=1nwixiλ1/λ,where parameter λ > 0, w=(w1, w2, …, wn)T is the weight vector of the arguments xi(i=1, 2, …, n), satisfying wi∈ [0,1] (i=1, 2, …, n) and∑i=1nwi=1.Definition 3 (GOWA operator[45]). A mapping f: [0,1]n→ [0,1] is called a generalized ordered weighted averaging (GOWA) operator of n-dimension iff(x1,x2,⋯,xn)=∑i=1nwix(i)λ1/λ,where (·) indicates a permutation on X such that x(1)≥x(2) ≥…≥ x(n), that is, x(i) is the ith largest one of all numerical values xk(k=1, 2, …, n), parameter λ > 0, w=(w1, w2, …, wn)T is a weight vector which is associated with f, satisfying wi∈ [0,1] (i=1, 2, …, n) and∑i=1nwi=1.When we use different choices of the parameters λ and w for the GOWA operator, we get some special cases: when λ → 0, f(x1, x2, …, xn) =∏i=1nx(i)wi, then the GOWA operator reduces to an ordered weighted geometric (OWG) operator [46]; when λ=1, f(x1, x2, …, xn) =∑i=1nwix(i), then the GOWA operator reduces to a OWA operator [47]; when λ → −∞, if wi≠ 0, for all i, then f(x1, x2, …, xn)=x(n)=min{xi}, then the GOWA operator reduces to the Min operator; when λ → +∞, if wi≠ 0, for all i, then f(x1, x2, …, xn)=x(1)=max{xi}, then GOWA operator reduces to the Max operator.Next, similar to GWA operator, a generalized weighted geometric (GWG) operator is defined as follows:Definition 4 (GWG operator). A mapping f: [0,1]n→ [0,1] is called a generalized weighted geometric (GWG) operator of n-dimension iff(x1,x2,⋯,xn)=1λ∏i=1n(λxi)wi,where parameter λ > 0, w=(w1, w2, …, wn)T is the weight vector of the arguments xi(i=1, 2, …, n), satisfying wi∈ [0,1] (i=1, 2, …, n) and∑i=1nwi=1.Definition 5 (GOWG operator). A mapping f: [0,1]n→ [0,1] is called a generalized ordered weighted geometric (GOWG) operator of n-dimension iff(x1,x2,⋯,xn)=1λ∏i=1n(λx(i))wi,Where (·) indicates a permutation on X such that x(1)≥x(2) ≥…≥ x(n), that is, x(i) is the ith largest one of all numerical values xk(k=1, 2, …, n), parameter λ > 0, w=(w1, w2, …, wn)T is a weight vector which is associated with f, satisfying wi∈ [0,1] (i=1, 2, …, n) and∑i=1nwi=1.Let X be a universe of discourse, and a fuzzy set in X is an expression A given byA=<x,μAx>|x∈Xwhere μA: X →[0,1] is a membership function which characterizes the membership degree of the element x to the set A.An important notion in fuzzy set theory is that of triangular norms and conorms that are used to define a generalized intersection and union of fuzzy sets, which is defined as follows [3]:Definition 6 (triangular norm). A triangular norm is a binary operation T on the unit interval [0,1], i.e., a function T: [0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1], such that for all x, y and z ∈ [0,1] the following four axioms are satisfied:(i)T(1, x)=x. (boundary condition)T(x, y)=T(y, x). (commutativity)T(x, T(y, z))=T(T(x, y), z). (associativity)T(x1, y1)≤T(x2, y2) whenever x1≤x2 and y1≤y2. (monotonicity)The corresponding triangular conorm of T (or the dual of T) is the function S: [0,1]×[0,1] → [0,1] defined by S(x, y) =1−T (1−x, 1−y).For many t-norms and t-conorms, there are some basic t-norms and t-conorms, namely, minimum TMand maximum SM, product TPand probabilistic sum SP, Łukasiewicz t-norm TLand Łukasiewicz t-conorm SL, Einstein product TEand Einstein product SE, and drastic product TDand drastic sum SD, given as follows, respectively:TMx,y=minx,y,SMx,y=maxx,y;TPx,y=x⋅y,SPx,y=x+y-x⋅y;TEx,y=xy1+1−x1−y,SEx,y=x+y1+xy;TDx,y=0,ifx,y∈[0,1)2minx,yotherwise,SDx,y=1,ifx,y∈(0,1]2maxx,yotherwise.Among these t-norms above, the drastic product TDand the minimum TMare the smallest and the largest t-norms, respectively (with respect to the pointwise order). For each t-norm T, it can be seen that TD≤T≤TM. Whereas the product TPand the Einstein t-norm TEare two prototypical examples of the class of strict Archimedean t-norms, which are continuous, strictly monotone, and have the Archimedean property [3].Hamacher [43] proposed a more generalized t-norm and t-conorm, called the Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm, which are defined as follows:TζH(x,y)=xyζ+(1−ζ)(x+y−xy);SζH(x,y)=x+y−xy−(1−ζ)xyζ+(1−ζ)(x+y−xy),ζ>0.Especially, when ζ=1, then the Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm reduce to TP(x, y)=x·y, SP(x, y)=x+y−x·y; when ζ=2, then Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm reduce to Einstein t-norm TEand t-conorm SE, respectively.In the following, some basic concepts of hesitant fuzzy set are briefly reviewed [13,14].Definition 7 (Hesitant fuzzy set). Let X be a fixed set, a hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) on X is defined in terms of a function h that returns a subset of [0,1] when applied to X. A HFS can be expressed as follows:E=<x,hEx>|x∈Xwhere hE(x) is a set of values in [0,1], denoting the possible membership degrees of the element x∈X to the set E. For convenience, we refer to h=hE(x) as a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE) and to H as the set of all HFEs.Torra and Narukawa [13,14] define the following three basic operational rules for any three HFEs, h, h1 and h2:(i)hC=∪γ∈h{1−γ};h1∪h2 =∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1∨γ2};h1∩h2 =∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1∧γ2}.The following order relation between HFEs is defined by Xia and Xu [15]:Definition 8 (HFEs order relation). For a HFE h,s(h)=∑γ∈hγ/δ(h)is called the score function of h, where δ (h) is the number of elements in h. For two HFEs, h1 and h2, if s(h1)>s(h2), then h1>h2; if s(h1)=s(h2), then h1=h2.In order to aggregate hesitant fuzzy information, Xia and Xu [15] proposed the following operations laws on HFEs.Definition 9 (Xia and Xu's operation rules on HFEs). For any given three HFEs, h, h1, h2, and λ > 0, four kinds of operations on HFEs are defined as follows:(i)h1⊕h2 =∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1+γ2−γ1γ2};h1⊗h2 =∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1γ2};λh =∪γ∈h{1−(1−γ)λ};hλ=∪γ∈h{γλ}.In essence, the addition and multiplication operators in Definition 9 are the algebraic sum and algebraic product operational rules on hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs), respectively, a special pair of dual t-norm and t-conorm. We can extend these operations to obtain more general operations on HFEs by means of the Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm, which are defined as follows:Definition 10 (Hamacher operation rules on HFEs). For any given three HFEs, h, h1, h2, and ζ > 0, based on Hamacher t-norm and t-conorm, some operations, called Hamacher operations, on HFEs h, h1 and h2 are defined as follows:(i)h1 ⊕Hh2 =∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1+γ2−γ1γ2−(1−ζ)γ1γ21−(1−ζ)γ1γ2};h1 ⊗Hh2 =∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1γ2ζ+(1−ζ)(γ1+γ2−γ1γ2)};λh =∪γ∈h{(1+(ζ−1)γ)λ−(1−γ)λ(1+(ζ−1)γ)λ+(ζ−1)(1−γ)λ},λ>0;hλ=∪γ∈h{ζγλ(1+(ζ−1)(1−γ))λ+(ζ−1)γλ},λ>0.Comparing Definition 10 with Definition 9, we can see that when ζ=1, these operations on HFEs in Definition 10 are reduced to those in Definition 9. That is to say, the operation in Definition 9 is a special case of Definition 10.Furthermore, when ζ=2, these basic operations on HFEs are reduced to the following:(i)h1 ⊕Eh2 =∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1+γ21−γ1γ2};h1 ⊗Eh2 =∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1γ21+(1−γ1)(1−γ2)};λh =∪γ∈h{(1+γ)λ−(1−γ)λ(1+γ)λ+(1−γ)λ},λ>0;hλ=∪γ∈h{2γλ(2−γ)λ+γλ},λ>0,Proposition 1. For three HFEs, h, h1, and h2, we have the following conclusions:(i)h1C⊕Hh2C=h1⊗Hh2C;h1C⊗Hh2C=h1⊕Hh2C;λ(hC)=hλC,λ>0;(hC)λ=λhC,λ>0.Proof.(i)h1C⊕Hh2C=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{(1−γ1)+(1−γ2)−(1−γ1)(1−γ2)−(1−ζ)(1−γ1)(1−γ2)1−(1−ζ)(1−γ1)(1−γ2)}=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{γ1+γ2+ζ(1−γ1)(1−γ2)γ1+γ2−γ1γ2+ζ(1−γ1)(1−γ2)}=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{1−γ1γ2ζ+(1−ζ)(γ1+γ2−γ1γ2)}=h1⊗Hh2C.h1C⊗Hh2C=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{(1−γ1)(1−γ2)ζ+(1−ζ)((1−γ1)+(1−γ2)−(1−γ1)(1−γ2))}=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{(1−γ1−γ2+γ1γ2)1−(1−ζ)γ1γ2}=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2{1−γ1+γ2−γ1γ2−(1−ζ)γ1γ21−(1−ζ)γ1γ2}=h1⊕Hh2C.λ(hC)=∪γ∈h{(1+(ζ−1)(1−γ))λ−γλ(1+(ζ−1)(1−γ))λ−(ζ−1)γλ}=∪γ∈h{1−ζγλ(1+(ζ−1)(1−γ))λ−(ζ−1)γλ}=hλC.(hC)λ=∪γ∈h{ζ(1−γ)λ(1+(ζ−1)γ)λ−(ζ−1)(1−γ)λ}=∪γ∈h{1−(1+(ζ−1)γ)λ−(1−γ)λ(1+(ζ−1)γ)λ−(ζ−1)(1−γ)λ}=λhC.With the above background, concepts and definitions, in the next section, we propose some new hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators.Definition 11 (aggregation function on HFEs[13]). Let E={h1, h2,…, hn} be a set of n HFEs, f be a function on E, f: [0,1]n→ [0,1], thenfE=⋃γ∈{h1×h2×⋯×hn}f(γ).Based on Definition 11 and Hamacher operations on HFEs in Definition 10, in the following, we propose a family of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators for HFEs, and their desirable properties are discussed.Definition 12 (HFHWA operator). Let E={h1, h2,…, hn} be a set of n HFEs. A hesitant fuzzy Hamacher weighted averaging (HFHWA) operator is a function Hn→ H such thatHFHWAζ(h1,h2,⋯,hn)=w1h1⊕Hw2h2⊕H⋯⊕Hwnhn=⊕Hj=1nwjhj, where parameter ζ>0, w=(w1, w2, …, wn)T is the weight vector of hj(j=1, 2, …, n), satisfying wj∈ [0,1] (j=1, 2, …, n) and∑j=1nwj=1.Theorem 1. Let E={h1, h2,…, hn} be a set of n HFEs, then the aggregated value by the HFHWA operator is also a HFE, furthermore,(1)HFHWAζh1,h2,⋯,hn=⋃γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,⋯γn∈hn∏j=1n1+(ζ−1)γjwj−∏j=1n(1−γj)wj∏j=1n1+(ζ−1)γjwj+ζ−1∏j=1n(1−γj)wjProofEq. (1) can be proved by mathematical induction on n as follows.For n=1, the result of Eq. (1) is clear.Suppose Eq. (1) holds for n=k, that isHFHWAζ(h1,h2,⋯,hk)=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,⋯γk∈hk∏j=1k(1+(ζ−1)γj)wj−∏j=1k(1−γj)wj∏j=1k(1+(ζ−1)γj)wj+(ζ−1)∏j=1k(1−γj)wj.Then when n=k+1, by Definition 12 and 10, we haveHFHWAζ(h1,h2,⋯,hk+1)=w1h1⊕Hw2h2⊕H⋯⊕Hwkhk⊕Hwk+1hk+1=HFHWAζ(h1,h2,⋯,hk)⊕Hwk+1hk+1∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,⋯γk∈hk∏j=1k(1+(ζ−1)γj)wj−∏j=1k(1−γj)wj∏j=1k(1+(ζ−1)γj)wj+(ζ−1)∏j=1k(1−γj)wj⊕H∪γk+1∈hk+1(1+(ζ−1)γk+1)wk+1−(1−γk+1)wk+1(1+(ζ−1)γk+1)wk+1−(ζ−1)(1−γk+1)wk+1.Leta1=∏i=1k(1+(ζ−1)γi)wi,b1=∏i=1k(1−γi)wi,a2=(1+(ζ−1)γk+1)wk+1andb2=(1−γk+1)wk+1, thenHFHWAζ(h1,h2,⋯,hk)=a1−b1a1+(ζ−1)b1,andwk+1hk+1=a2−b2a2+(ζ−1)b2.Thus according to Definition 10, we haveHFHWAζ(h1,h2,⋯,hk)⊕Hwk+1hk+1=a1−b1a1+(ζ−1)b1⊕Ha2−b2a2+(ζ−1)b2=∪γ1∈h1,⋯γk∈hk,γk+1∈hk+1a1−b1a1+(ζ−1)b1+a2−b2a2+(ζ−1)b2−a1−b1a1+(ζ−1)b1⋅a2−b2a2+(ζ−1)b2−(1−ζ)a1−b1a1+(ζ−1)b1⋅a2−b2a2+(ζ−1)b21−(1−ζ)a1−b1a1+(ζ−1)b1⋅a2−b2a2+(ζ−1)b2=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,⋯γk+1∈hk+1∏j=1k+1(1+(ζ−1)γj)wj−∏j=1k+1(1−γj)wj∏j=1k+1(1+(ζ−1)γj)wj+(ζ−1)∏j=1k+1(1−γj)wji.e. Eq. (1) holds for n=k+1. Thus, Eq. (1) holds for all n.Remark 2. For the HFHWA operator, if ζ = 1, then the HFHWA operator (1) is reduced to the following:HFWAwh1,h2,⋯,hn=⊕j=1nwjhj=∪γ1∈h1,γ2∈h2,⋯γn∈hn1−∏j=1n1−γjwj,which is called the hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (HFWA) operator by Xia and Xu [15].

Weights have different meanings for HFHWA and HFHOWA operators. Motivated by idea of combining the WA and OWA operators [48], in the following, we develop hesitant fuzzy Hamacher hybrid operators, which weigh both the given hesitant fuzzy set and its ordered position.Definition 20 (HFHHA operator). Let E={h1, h2,…, hn} be a set of n HFEs. A hesitant fuzzy Hamacher hybrid averaging (HFHHA) operator of dimension n is a function Hn→ H that has an associated weighting vector w=(w1, w2, …, wn) with wj> 0 and∑i=1nwj=1, such that(9)HFHHAζ(h1,h2,⋯,hn)=⊕Hj=1nwjh˙σ(j),whereh˙σ(j)is the jth largest of the weighted hesitant fuzzy valuesh˙k(h˙k=nωkhk, k=1, 2, …, n), ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn) is the weight vector of hk(j=1, 2, …, n) with ωk> 0 and∑k=1nωk=1, and n is the balancing coefficient.According to Hamacher operations over HFEs, by mathematical induction on n, we can obtain the mathematical expression of Eq.

For a multicriteria decision making problem with hesitant fuzzy information, let A=(a1, a2, …, am) be a set of alternatives, C=(c1, c2, …, cn) be a set of criteria with the criteria weight vectors w=(w1, w2, …, wn)T such that wj> 0 (j=1, 2, …, n) and∑j−1nwj=1. Assume that the evaluated value of alternative ai(i =1, 2, …, m) with respect to criteria cj(j =1, 2, …, m) is expressed by a HFEhij=∪γij∈hij{γij}∈H, which is a set of possible evaluated values of alternative ai∈ A with respect to criteria cj∈ C. We can then obtain a hesitant fuzzy decision making matrixD=(hij)m×n.Generally, there are two types of criteria in MADM problems, i.e., cost criteria (the smaller the attribute value the better) and benefit criteria (the larger the attribute value the better). If all the criteria cj(j=1, 2, …, n) are of the same type, then the criteria values do not need to be normalized. If there are benefit attributes and cost attributes in MCDM, the criteria values of the cost type can be transformed into criteria values of the benefit type, according to the following Eq. (17):(17)rij=hij,forbenefitattributecjhijC,forcostattributecj,i=1,2,&,m;j=1,2,&,nwhere(hij)Cis the complement of hijsuch that(hij)C=∪γij∈hij1−γij. In this case, the hesitant fuzzy decision matrixD=(hij)m×ncan be transformed into a corresponding hesitant fuzzy decision matrixR=(rij)m×n.To obtain the best alternative(s), the HFHWA (or HFHWG) operator, as one of the proposed hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators, is applied to develop a multicriteria decision making procedure for hesitant fuzzy MCDA problems, where the following steps are involved.Step 1The decision makers give their evaluated values of alternative ai∈ A with respect to criteria ci∈ C, which are expressed by hesitant fuzzy elements hij(i=1, 2, …, m; j=1, 2, …, n).Transform the hesitant fuzzy decision making matrixD=(hij)m×ninto a normalized matrixR=(rij)m×n, according to Eq. (17).For alternative ai, aggregate all the hesitant fuzzy values rij(j=1, 2, …, n) into a global value riby means of the hesitant fuzzy Hamacher weighted average (HFHWA) operator as follows:Compute the scores s(ri) of the global HFE ri(i=1, 2, …, m) in accordance with Definition 8.Rank all the alternatives ai(i=1, 2, …, m) and select the best one(s) according to s(ri) (i=1, 2, …, m).End.In this paper, a family of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher operators is proposed for aggregating hesitant fuzzy information, such as HFHWA, HFHWG, GHFHWA, GHFHWG, HFHOWA, HFHOWG, GHFHOWA, GHFHOWG, HFHHA, HFHWG, GHFHHA and GHFHHG operators. The family of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operator is composed of two kinds of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher operators, i.e., the hesitant fuzzy Hamacher averaging operator and the hesitant fuzzy Hamacher geometric operator. For the two types of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher operators, HFHWA and HFHWG operators are two basic hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators, respectively. Based on these, other hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators are developed. Thus, HFHWA and HFHWG operators are chosen to aggregate the hesitant fuzzy information in Step 3. In the following application we check whether the rankings of the alternatives are same for the HFHWA and HFHWG operators by means of a numerical example.We now consider a real example for detailed illustration of the above decision making procedure.A board of directors of an enterprise consists of five members, and they are planning to invest a sum of money in a suitable project of huge potential over the next 5 years [49]. Suppose four possible projects A=(a1, a2, a3, a4) will be evaluated by the board of directors. To evaluate and rank these projects, four criteria are suggested by the Balanced Score card methodology (it should be noted that all of them are of the maximization type) [15], that is, c1: financial perspective, c2: the customer satisfaction, c3: internal business process perspective, and c4: learning and growth perspective. The weight vector of the criteria is given as w=(0.2, 0.3, 0.15, 0.35)T.Next, we utilize the above proposed approach to choose the best project.Step 1. During the evaluation process, it is necessary for the five members of the board of directors to anonymously provide their own different preferences in which the alternative aisatisfies cj. Then the decision matrixD=(hij)m×ncan be expressed by the hesitant fuzzy sets in Table 1. Since these criteria are all benefit criteria, it is not necessary to normalize the decision matrix D.Step 2. Let ζ = 0.5, and aggregate all of the preference values hij(j =1, 2, 3, 4) in the ith line of the decision matrix D, according to Eq. (18), into global values riof alternative ai(i = 1, 2, 3, 4). The global values riare not listed here due to vast amount of data.Step 3. Calculate the score values s(ri)(i=1, 2, 3, 4) of riby Definition 8, as follows:s(r1)=0.5739,s(r2)=0.6188,s(r2)=0.5269,s(r4)=0.6723.Step 4. According to the results of step 3, we have s(r4)≥s(r2)≥s(r1)≥s(r3). Thus a4≻a2≻a1≻a3, so the best alternative is a4.Further let ζ=0.1, 0.3, 2, 5, 7, respectively, which indicates the decision makers’ different preferences over decision making information. We can get the corresponding scores and rakings of the alternatives, as listed in Table 2.In order to illustrate how the different attitudinal character parameter ζ plays a role in the aggregation operator, we use the different values of ζ∈(0,10], which are given by the decision-makers. The changing trends of global preference score functions s(ri)(i=1, 2, 3, 4) with respect to ζ in HFHWA are shown in Fig. 1. It is easy to see from Fig. 1 that the score values obtained by the HFHWA operator become smaller with increase of the parameter ζ. Decision-makers can choose the values of parameter ζ in accordance with their preferences. From Fig. 1, for the HFHWA operator, there is no influence on the final rankings of the alternatives for parameter ζ∈(0,10].If the HFHWA operator is replaced by the HFHWG operator in the above step 2, Table 3lists the score values and rankings of the alternatives. Comparing Table 2 with Table 3, we can observe that the score value obtained by the HFHWG operator is always smaller than the score value obtained by the HFHWA operator for the same parameter value ζ and the same aggregation argument values.Fig. 2indicates the changing trends of the global score functions s(ri)(i=1, 2, 3, 4) with respect to ζ in HFHWG operator. From Fig. 2, it is easy to see that the score values obtained by HFHWG operator become greater with the increase of parameter ζ. The rankings of alternatives with different parameter ζ are given as follows:(i)If ζ∈(0, 0.36], then a4≻a3≻a1≻a2.If ζ∈(0.36, 1.39], then a4≻a1≻a3≻a2.If ζ∈(1.39, 3.50], then a4≻a1≻a2≻a3.If ζ∈(3.50, 10.0], then a4≻a2≻a1≻a3.Thus, for the HFHWG operator, the choice of parameter value ζ has a great impact on the score values of the alternatives, and the ranking of the alternatives is affected. From the above analysis, we can see that although the best alternative obtained by the HFHWA operator is the same as that obtained by the HFHWG operator, the rankings of alternatives are different between the HFHWA and HFHWA operators.First, we compare the proposed method with Xia and Xu's method [15], where the hesitant fuzzy weighted averaging (HFWA) and hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric (HFWG) operator were proposed for the hesitant fuzzy MCDM.For the above numerical example, if the HFHWA operator is replaced by the HFWA operator in the above step 2, i.e.,ri=HFWA(ri1,ri2,ri3,ri4)=⊗j=14(rij)wj=∪γi1∈ri1,γi2∈ri2,⋯γi4∈ri41−∏j=14(1−γij)wj,then, we can obtain the score values s(ri)(i=1, 2, 3, 4) of riby Definition 8 as follows:s(r1)=0.5612,s(r2)=0.6009,s(r2)=0.5191,s(r4)=0.6534.In this case, we have a4≻a2≻a1≻a3. The best alternative is a4.If the HFHWG operator is replaced by the HFWG operator in the above step 2, i.e.,ri=HFWG(ri1,ri2,ri3,ri4)=⊗j=14(rij)wj=∪γi1∈ri1,γi2∈ri2,⋯γi4∈ri4∏j=14(γij)wj,then, we can obtain the score values s(ri)(i=1, 2, 3, 4) of riby Definition 8 as follows:s(r1)=0.4744,s(r2)=0.4625,s(r2)=0.4672,s(r4)=0.5176.In this case, we have a4≻a1≻a3≻a2. The best alternative is a4.From the above analysis, we can see that although the best alternative is the same for the both HFHWA and HFHWG, or HFWA and HFWG, the ranking of the alternatives is different between the HFHWA and HFHWG, or HFWA and HFWG. It indicates that different types of hesitant fuzzy operators can cause different final results.It is indicated from Fig. 2 that the choice of parameter ζ∈(0, 10] in the HFHWG has influence on the ranking of the alternatives. If ζ=1, the HFHWA operator reduces to the HFWA operator and the HFHWG operator reduces to the HFWG operator, which indicates that the decision maker is neutral. Thus the meaning of ζ indicates that the decision makers’ different preferences have effects on the score values of the alternatives, which leads to the different optimal alternatives.In the following, we compare our method with the hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS method [22] for MCDM. We review the approach as follows:Step 1: for a MCDM problem with hesitant fuzzy information, let A=(a1, a2, …, am) be a set of alternatives, C=(c1, c2, …, cn) be a set of criteria with the criteria weight vector w=(w1, w2, …, wn)T such that wj> 0 (j=1, 2, …, n) and∑j−1nwj=1. SupposeD=(hij)m×nis the hesitant fuzzy decision making matrix, wherehij=∪γij∈hij{γij}∈His an HFE. Normalizing the hesitant fuzzy decision matrixD=(hij)m×nby Eq. (17), we can obtain a corresponding normalized hesitant fuzzy decision matrixR=(rij)m×n.Step 2: Under a hesitant fuzzy environment, the hesitant fuzzy positive ideal solution (HFPIS), denoted by α+, and the hesitant fuzzy negative ideal solution (HFNIS), denoted by α−, can be defined as follows:(20)α+=cj,maxi(rijσ(k))|j=1,2,⋯,n=<c1,((r11)+,(r12)+,⋯(r1l)+)>,⋯,<cn,((rn1)+,(rn2)+,⋯(rnl)+)>,(21)α−=cj,mini(rijσ(k))|j=1,2,⋯,n=<c1,((r11)−,(r12)−,⋯(r1l)−)>,⋯,<cn,((rn1)−,(rn2)−,⋯(rnl)−)>,whererijσ(k)is the kth smallest value in rij.Step 3: The separation between alternatives can be measured by the Hamming distance or Euclidean distance. In order to measure the distances between HFEs, we adopt the hesitant fuzzy Euclidean distance proposed by Xu and Xia [16]. The separation measures,di+anddi−, of each alternative from the HFPIS α+ and the HFNIS α−, respectively, are derived as follows:(22)di+=∑j=1nd(rij,rj+)wj=∑j=1nwj1l∑k=1l|rijσ(k)−(rjσ(k))+|2,i=1,2,&,m(23)di−=∑j=1nd(rij,rj−)wj=∑j=1nwj1l∑k=1l|rijσ(k)−(rjσ(k))−|2,i=1,2,&,mStep 4: The relative closeness coefficient of alternative aiis calculated as the following formula:(24)πi=di−di++di−,where 0≤πi≤1, i=1, 2,…, m. Obviously, an alternative aiis closer to the HFPIS (α+) and farther from the HFNIS (α−) as πiapproximates 1. Therefore, according to the closeness coefficient πi, we can determine the ranking orders of all the alternatives and select the best one.Now we repeat the numerical example using the hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS method for the most desirable alternative(s), which involved the following steps:Step 1: For the hesitant fuzzy decision matrixD=(hij)m×n(see Table 1), utilize Eqs. (20) and (21) to determine the corresponding HFPIS α+ and the HFNIS α−, respectively:α+=<0.9,0.7,0.5,0.3,0.3>,<0.8,0.6,0.4,0.2,0.2>,<0.9,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.5>,<0.9,0.8,0.8,0.8,0.8>,α−=<0.6,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2>,<0.4,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.1>,<0.7,0.6,0.4,0.3,0.2>,<0.7,0.6,0.5,0.2,0.2>.Step 2: utilize Eqs. (22) and (23) to calculate the separation measures,di+anddi−, of each alternative from the HFPIS α+ and the HFNIS α−, respectively,d1+=0.2077,d2+=0.1716,d3+=0.2189,d4+=0.1338;d1−=0.1486,d2−=0.1683,d3−=0.1077,d4−=0.2097.Step 3: utilize Eq. (24) to calculate the relative closeness coefficient of alternative ai, respectively,π1=0.4171,π2=0.4951,π3=0.3298,π4=0.6105.Step 4: According to the relative closeness coefficients, we have the following ranking: a4≻a2≻a1≻a3. The best alternative is a4.It is obvious that the ranking of alternatives obtained by the hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS method is the same as that by the HFHWA aggregation operator, which reflects the validity of the proposed method in this paper.Compared with the existing hesitant fuzzy MCDM method, our proposed approaches have the following advantages. First, In general, decision makers often are limited in rational; they often show an optimistic attitude or a pessimistic attitude in the face of decision making information. An optimistic attitude often results in a risk seeking preference, and a pessimistic attitude results in a risk aversion preference. By means of the attitudinal character parameter ζ, a decision-maker's subjective attitude to decision making problem is taken into account so that it is more reasonable for obtaining a better decision result. Second, by means of different parameter values, the dynamic variation trend of rankings of alternatives can be shown clearly. Relative to a static fixed evaluated result obtained by the existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators, the dynamic evaluated result can better reflect the inherent variety law.

Hesitant fuzzy multiple criteria decision making is an important research field in hesitant fuzzy set theory and modern decision science in an uncertain environment. Information aggregation is one of the core issues. In this paper, based on Hamacher operational rules of HFEs, we have developed a family of hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators, including the HFHWA, HFHWG, GHFHWA, GHFHWG, HFHOWA, HFHOWG, GHFHOWA, GHFHOWG, HFHHA, HFHWG, GHFHHA and GHFHHG operators. Some basic properties of the proposed aggregation operators, such as idempotency, boundedness, and monotonicity, have been investigated in detail. The relationships between them have been discussed. We compared the proposed operators with the existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators and obtained corresponding relations. These proposed hesitant fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators provide a good complement to the existing work on HFSs. According to the HFHWA and HFHWG operators, a new method for multicriteria decision making is developed in hesitant fuzzy environments. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the hesitant fuzzy MCDM process. By systematic comparison between the proposed methods in this paper with previously proposed hesitant fuzzy MCDM methods, some advantages of the proposed hesitant fuzzy MCDM methods are shown.
