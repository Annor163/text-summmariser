@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Changes of carbon stocks in agricultural soils, emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture, and the delivery of ecosystem services of agricultural landscapes depend on combinations of land-use, livestock density, farming practices, climate and soil types. Many environmental processes are highly non-linear. If the analysis of the environmental impact is based on data at a relatively coarse-scale (e.g. farm, country, or large administrative regions), conclusions can be misleading. For an accurate assessment of agri-environmental indicators, data of agricultural activities and their dynamics are needed at high spatial resolution. In this paper, we develop and validate a spatial model for predicting the agricultural land-use areas within the homogenous spatial units (HSUs). For the EU-28 countries, we distinguish about 1.5 × 105 HSUs and we consider 30 possible land-uses to match with the classification used in the Common Agricultural Policy Regionalized Impact (CAPRI) model. The comparison of model predictions with independent observations and with a simple rule-based approach at HSU level demonstrates that the predictions are generally accurate in more than 75 % of HSUs. The frequent crops or land-use are better predicted. For non-frequent crops and/or crops requiring specific cultivation conditions, the model needs further fine-tuning.SoftwareThe Land-Use Disaggregation Model (LUDM) aims at predicting the land-use areas within the fine-scale units.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The agricultural sector contributes with about 10.6% to the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, excluding Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), in the EU-27 (EEA, 2012) and with 12% to the worldwide emissions (Lehuger et al., 2011). Agri-environmental indicators are used for assessing the impacts of agricultural activities on the environment and they include nitrogen balance, GHG emissions, losses of reactive N from agricultural sources, soil erosion or soil carbon stock changes. Most of the agri-environmental indicators are calculated by combining spatial information on agricultural land-use, livestock density, farming practices, soil characteristics and climate variables at a local, farm, sub-regional or regional scale (Leip et al., 2008; Lamboni et al., 2009; Gocht and Röder, 2014; Follador et al., 2011; Leip, 2011; Leip et al., 2013; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2011). Reliable environmental impact assessment requires the availability of the data and its dynamics at a high spatial resolution. Many environmental processes are highly non-linear. If the analysis of the environmental impact is based on data at a relatively coarse-scale (e.g. large administrative regions), conclusions can be misleading (Gocht and Röder, 2014). Exceedance of thresholds or the identification of hotspots is often more meaningful than average values (Leip et al., 2008; Britz and Leip, 2009; Leip, 2011; Kempen et al., 2005; Gocht and Röder, 2014). For example, nitrate may be leached to the groundwater from intensive green maize cultivations with high fertilizer N input on soils with coarse texture. This effect may be missed if N input is averaged over all cultivations and soils.The development of highly heterogeneous environmental indicators has been widely investigated, including semantic interpolation and fuzzy similarity approaches; first, second or higher order approximations (Dubois et al., 1997; Mas et al., 2012; Bordogna et al., 2012). Land use modelling is an important approach for evaluating global environmental impact (Pérez-Vega et al., 2012).When the main factors driving the environmental indicators are highly heterogeneous, quantification of agri-environmental impact faces the challenge of the trade-off between relatively simple first-order methods on one hand and potentially higher accuracy but more cumbersome methodologies on the other hand. We used a first order approach while minimizing the aggregation bias by defining spatial units for which the factors take a single vector of values (homogeneity regarding these factors). Various shapes of fine scale units are conceivable depending on the thematic focus.Recently, Leip, 2011 created a map of Homogeneous Spatial Units (HSU) for Europe including parts of the Near East and Northern Africa. A HSU is the finer-scale spatial clustering driven by the search for homogeneity with regard to selected environmental factors. It is defined as cluster of km2 grid cells within a subnational region (e.g. NUTS2/3) which covers an area of similar characteristics in terms of soil, climate and relief. For the current extent of the European Union (EU-28), about 1.5 × 105 HSUs were delineated (excluding evident non-agricultural areas). Corresponding to the chosen grid resolution,22The grid is based on the recommendations of the 1st European Workshop on Reference Grids in 2003 (Annoni, 2005) and the INSPIRE draft specifications on geographical grid systems (INSPIRE, 2008) with ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area coordinate reference system and the center of the projection at the point 52 ° N, 10 ° E and false northing: Y = 3,210,000 m, false easting: X = 4,321,000 m.the minimum size of a HSU is 1 km2. The average (resp. median) size of the HSUs in EU-28 is 22 km2 (resp. 11 km2). The largest HSUs with areas of up to 566 km2 occur in zones of high homogeneity of the delineation parameters (e.g. Northern Baltic States).The land-use areas within the HSUs are required as prior information for developing landscape, biodiversity and other agri-environmental indicators in a series of steps including the disaggregation of animal numbers (a.o. via fodder production) and the disaggregation of the N-input (combining crop requirements, N-availability and local environmental conditions) (Leip et al., 2008; Britz and Leip, 2009; Leip, 2011). They serve also as a link between agro-economic models such as the Common Agricultural Policy Regionalized Impact (CAPRI) model and biophysical models such as framework DNDC-EUROPE (Leip et al., 2008).Some disaggregation approaches (Reibel and Agrawal, 2007; Kempen et al., 2005; Chakir, 2009; Lamboni et al., 2013; Röder and Gocht, 2013; Gocht and Röder, 2014), mainly the dasymetric mapping approaches, make use of statistical information about the land-use at a coarse-scale, geographically-referenced or remote sensing data and ground-based and point-based observations to predict the land-use areas within the fine-scale units such as HSUs. To be consistent with the statistical data available at a coarse-scale (mainly at an administrative level), these approaches first estimate the prior distribution of the land-use areas at a fine-scale and then constrain the predicted areas with respect to the statistical data available at a coarse-scale using the Bayesian highest posterior density.In this paper, we propose an extension of the dasymetric mapping approaches by proposing a full Bayesian approach for building the disaggregation model and for predicting the land-use areas inside HSUs. The aim of this paper is to propose a generic Bayesian framework for spatial disaggregation of shares from a coarse-scale (e.g. administrative region) into HSUs. We model the shares inside a given HSU using a multinomial model and we use the disaggregation model for predicting the land-use areas within the HSUs for the all EU-28 countries. The model includes three steps presented in Fig. 1. First, we combine point-based field observations of land-use with the environmental and topographical information, land cover classes and the prices of selected products to get the a priori distribution of the model parameters. Second, we propose a transformation that allows for integrating land-use statistics available at an administrative level in order to update the model parameters (a posteriori distributions). Third, we propose the constrained prediction of land-use areas inside the HSUs that match with the land-use areas available at an administrative level (NUTS2/333Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics, level 2 or 3.) and with the areas of the HSU units using the quadratic programming (QP) approach. We discuss the results, including the validation of the model with independent high resolution data for France and the comparison of the model predictions with the results of a simple rule-based disaggregation approach.The paper is organized as follows: we describe the question treated in Section 2 and the data in Section 3. We present the global structure of the model and the estimation of the model parameters in Section 4. We also present the QP problem and the constraints used in the case of land-use areas. Section 5 presents the main choices made in order to get the results by taking into account the particularity of some countries. In Section 6, we discuss the predicted results and we conclude in Section 7.Throughout this paper, we use Fig. 2to characterize both fine-scale units and coarse-scale units. We suppose that a coarse-scale unit is a collection of fine-scale units that belong to it and a fine-scale unit belongs to only one coarse-scale unit. The fine-scale unit is what we call Homogenous Spatial Unit (HSU). A HSU is one of the possible finer-scale spatial clustering driven by the search for better homogeneity. HSU is a grid cell of 1 km × 1 km, or a collection of these grid cells having similar properties. A HSU is characterized by its explanatory variables and its area ah.Coarse-scale units used are administrative regions at the NUTS2 or NUTS3 level. An administrative region called NUTS2 is a collection of the NUTS3 sub-regions that belong to it. An administrative sub-region called NUTS3 is a collection of the HSU units that belong to it (see Fig. 2). Each HSU belongs to one NUTS3 region. For readability and without loss of generality, we use in the following text the terms “HSU” (resp. “NUTS3” or “NUTS2”) to refer to the fine-scale unit (resp. coarse-scale unit).Throughout this paper, we use L as the number of all possible and exclusive land-use classes. We useAn=[A1,n,…,Al,n,…,AL,n]Tas a vector of land-use areas with n = 1,2,…,N. N is the total number of vector of observations of land-use areas inside a given NUTS2 region. As we often have one vector of observations per NUTS3 sub-region, N is the number of NUTS3 that belongs to a given NUTS2. For Germany, we have one observation per NUTS2, e.g. N = 1.Letℙr(⋅)denote the probability;E(⋅)denote the expectation andMSE(⋅)be the mean square error. We useIas an identity matrix andI⊗xTas a matrix obtained by replacing 1 inIwithxT. We use⊗as the Kronecker product.In this paper we propose a methodology to predict the land-use shares or land use areas in each HSU by combining data from various sources, as illustrated in Fig. 3.On one hand, statistical data on land-use are available at NUTS2 and NUTS3 level. On the other hand geographical information is available at high spatial resolution. The spatial and temporal variation of the geographical variables depicts the heterogeneous distribution of these variables and of land used within the administrative region. For instance, in Fig. 3, it is unlikely that the shares of grass (GRAS) and soft wheat (SWHE) are the same in both HSUs (HSU1 and HSU2) that belong to the same NUTS3 (NUTS31). We assume that part of the temporal variation in, or cross-border differences of, the land-use is also caused by price fluctuations motivating farmers to increase or reduce the cultivation of a certain crop independent of environmental conditions (Chakir, 2009).We used the geographical, point-based observations of land-use (LU) that provide information on the repartition of land-use within an administrative region (see crosses in the box ‘LUCAS data’). This information is used to link administrative and geographical information in order to characterize each point-based observation with its environmental condition (climate, soil, and land cover classes), topographical information (relief) and prices both in time and in space. With this data and the land-use statistics (FSS), the challenge is to build a model (LUDM) that is able to predict the land-use areas inside each HSU and to assure that the predictions are consistent with the land-use statistics (FSS) to avoid creating or loosing the land.The LUCAS survey is a point-based field survey over EU countries and it gives, at each georeferenced location, the land-cover/use observed (for instance, see points on map d of Fig. 9). It is carried out by EUROSTAT since 2001. In this paper, we used LUCAS survey data of 2001, 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2009. The land-use classes of these data had been reclassified and regrouped into about 30 classes of agricultural land-use/cover, including forest and grassland, to match with the classification used in the CAPRI model (see Appendix J). For some of the countries, the LUCAS data was not available (e.g. Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Romania). In these cases, we used the LUCAS data from the neighboring countries.The Farm Structure Survey (FSS, EUROSTAT, 2010) provided the observations of the agricultural land-use areas at an administrative level (NUTS3) for all the European countries except Germany for which the data were available at only at NUTS2 level. Therefore, for Germany we had only one observation of land-use areas (N = 1) for each NUTS2 region, while we had at least two land use observations (N > 1) per NUTS2 region for the other EU-countries (see NUTS3 layer on map d of Fig. 9).Forest areas are available at a 25 m × 25 m grid (Pekkarinen et al., 2009; Kempeneers et al., 2013) and are aggregated (summed) to the HSU level and to the regional scale (NUTS2 for Germany and NUTS3 for others EU-countries). Discussion on forest areas is available in Appendix A.The land cover map (Coordination of information on the environment in Europe -CORINE) describes land cover based on the visual interpretation of satellite images. CORINE Land Cover (2006/2000) data are provided by the European Environment Agency (ETCSIA, 2012; ESA, 2008) for the area of EU-28. The nomenclature includes 44 classes of agricultural, urban and natural areas (see Appendix K).The meteorological data for a 25 km by 25 km grid were available from the EC-JRC AGRI4CAST (EC-JRC-AGRI4CAST, 2012). The meteorological database provided daily and interpolated data from 1975 to date for the EU-28 Member States. We used daily mean temperature and rainfall for the years 2000–2009. Discussion on data is available in Appendix A.Percentage of organic carbon content, sand and clay were based on the soil mapping units of the Harmonized World Soil Data Base-HWSD. The soil unit database content is described in detail in the documentation of the HWSD (see FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-CAS/JRC, 2009).Slope and altitude for each 1 km by 1 km grid cell were based on the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from Jarvis et al., 2008.The prices of major agricultural products are available at a regional level (NUTS2) for different years (e.g. 2001, 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2009) from the CAPRI system. A set of selected products includes staple crops, cash crops, and animal products that can impact the choice of using land as pasture or for fodder crops.To build the model, we used all these datasets from different sources and for years close to 2010 as we have the land-use statistics available for year 2010. Thus, we face with some uncertainties in data (Brodlie et al., 2012) such as:•uncertainty in time: variation in time of some variables as we used available data for years close to 2010;uncertainty in the definition of variables: a variable from different datasets can have similar definition but not exactly the same;data confidentiality uncertainty: some values are replaced by other values for data confidentiality reasons;uncertainty in data source: difference among similar available datasets.Soil characteristics (organic content, sand, and clay); topographical information (slope and altitude); meteorological variables (annual rainfall, sum of temperature and vegetation period) and CORINE land cover classes are used as explanatory variables to characterize the HSUs. In addition to these environmental variables, we add economic variables such as prices of main crops and animal products (wheat, barley, rape seeds, potatoes, milk, beef and pork) as these prices can impact the farmers' decision to grow a certain crop. We use LUCAS data from two or more NUTS2 regions or the LUCAS data for a completely different country during the process of building the model for a given NUTS2. We also use the LUCAS data for different years. Table 1provides an overview of the explanatory variables used.This section provides the main structure of the land-use disaggregation model and the Bayesian approach used for estimating the model parameters. We start with the model structure to give an overview of the model and then present the prior and posterior estimations of the model parameters.The general structure of the model is outlined in Figs. 2 and 4. Without loss of generality, we suppose that an administrative NUTS2 region is divided into two sub-regions (NUTS31, NUTS32) and each sub-region (for instance NUTS31) is divided into two HSUs (HSU1 and HSU2) as illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows that the input variables at a coarse-scale (NUTS3 or NUTS2) are the average of the input variables across all HSUs (fine-scale units) that belong to the same coarse-scale.We assume that we have two possible land-uses (grassland-GRAS and soft wheat-SWHE); two main input variables (SAND and RAIN) that govern the allocation of agricultural land-use.Fig. 4 shows how we use and combine the available datasets to predict the land-use areas within the HSUs. The point-based observations (LUCAS data) provide information on the repartition of land-use within the NUTS2 region. Indeed, a large land area used for a given land-use class should result in a frequent observation in the LUCAS data and vice versa. As all land-uses are in competition, given some environmental conditions (percentage of sand-SAND and annual rainfall-RAIN), we model the land-use areas (GRAS and SWHE areas) in each HSU (e.g. HSU1, HSU2) using a multinomial logit model. We assume we have the same vector of the model parameters for a given region (NUTS2). LUCAS data and the input variables are used to get the a priori distributions of the model parameters (β) and thus to identify the function share (f(SAND,RAIN,β1)), which gives the proportions of land-use for a given HSU (see details in Section 5).The function share can be used to predict the land-use areas within the HSUs belonging to the NUTS2 region using the a priori distributions of the model parameters (see Kempen et al., 2005; Röder and Gocht, 2013; Lamboni et al., 2013; Gocht and Röder, 2014). We consider a second step (see Section 4.3) which allows for integrating the observations of the land-use areas available mainly at a NUTS3 level into the process of estimating the model parameters.A Bayesian approach combines the prior distributions of the model parameters and the average of input variables with the transformation of land-use areas (at NUTS3) to improve the estimations of model parameters (see details in Section 4.3). It gives the updated disaggregation function (f(SAND,RAIN,β2)) used to get the predictions in each HSU, including the uncertainties of these predictions (standard deviation in brackets).This step is important to:•provide updated and improved model parameters compared to those obtained in the first step;correct some potential bias when working with a non-relevant point-based survey data (EU-countries not covered by LUCAS survey) or using the LUCAS data for other regions (NUTS2) or countries;include non-frequent land-use in the model, which are not found in the first step.This second step furthermore allows for quickly updating the model parameters when new observations of land-use areas become available.To be consistent with the observations of the land-uses areas, available mainly at NUTS3 level, we provide constrained predictions of the land-use areas within the HSUs using the mean square error to measure the quality of the predictions (step 3). Basically, we constrain the Bayesian predictions by minimizing the mean square error subject to some constraints (see details in Section 4.4). The constraints are: the sum of the land-use area across all HSUs must match with the area of that land-use area at a regional scale (NUTS3) and the sum of the crop area within a HSU layer must be less than the area of the HSU minus the area of the forest which is known.In each HSU, all land-uses are in a competition given the explanatory variables. A multinomial logit model (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000) makes use of a linear combination of all the explanatory variables (Table 1) to explain simultaneously the probabilities or the percentages of all the land-use categories using a link function: the logistic function.Let L denote the number of all possible and exclusive land-uses within a HSU unit (h) and xhbe the (d × 1) vector of input variables (see Table 1); we predict the land-use area (ah,l) for each category of land-use l using the following model:(4.1)ah,l=exp(βˇlTxh)∑l=1Lexp(βˇlTxh)×ah,withβˇl,l=1,2,…,Lthe (d × 1) model parameters for a category of land-use l and ahthe area of the HSU unit.Remark 4.1If we definesh,l=exp(βˇlTxh)/∑l=1Lexp(βˇlTxh), we have ah,l= sh,l× ah. Thus, estimating the land-use area ah,lis equivalent to estimate the share or percentage of the same land-use sh,las the area of the HSU unit ahis known.Equation (4.1) gives the land-use area and the logarithm of the relative proportion of the land-use area with respect to the referenced category (L), i.e.zh=[log(ah,1ah,L),…,log(ah,L−1ah,L)]T, is a realization of a stochastic process Zh(Zh= zh+ε) which follows a multivariate logistic distribution (see McFadden, 1974; Frühwirth-Schnatter and Frühwirth, 2012 for more details). A multivariate logistic distribution can be approximated by a multivariate normal distribution as follows (Kotz et al., 2005; Frühwirth-Schnatter and Frühwirth, 2012):(4.2)Zh∼NL−1(Xhβ,R),withβ=[βˇ1T−βˇLT,…,βˇL−1T−βˇLT]Tthe (d(L − 1) × 1) vector of parameters;Xh=IL−1⊗xTthe (L − 1 × d(L − 1)) matrix of input variables and R = (Ri,i= π2/3, Ri,j|i≠j= π2/6) the covariance matrix of the type (L − 1 × L − 1) (see Kotz et al., 2005; Frühwirth-Schnatter and Frühwirth, 2012).The likelihood of Zhis used to get the Bayesian inference if the observations of the land-use areas are available at the HSU level. When the observations of the land-use areas are available at a coarse-scale (case of disaggregation), the geometric mean, convenient when working with relative proportions, allows for deriving the likelihood of the model at a coarse-scale based on the likelihood at the HSU level. Thus, the likelihood of the relative proportions of the land-use areas within a given coarse-scale unit (Yn) follows a multivariate normal distribution under a technical assumption of independence among the HSUs (see Table 2and Appendix B) for more explanation and assumptions made:(4.3)Yn∼NL−1(Xnβ,Rn),withXn=1Hn∑h=1HnXh; Rn= R/Hnand Hnis the number of HSU units that belong to a given coarse-scale.Giving the likelihood of the model at a coarse-scale, it becomes possible to formally integrate the data of land-use areas available only at that level through a general Bayesian linear model. The general Bayesian linear model (Smith, 1973) is defined as follows:(4.4)π(yn|β)∼NL−1(Xnβ,Rn)(4.5)π(β)∼D(β0,B0),where π(β) is a priori distribution of the parameters with meanβ0 and covariance matrix B0.While the classical algorithm such as Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling can be used to get the posterior distributions of the parameters, we consider a conjugate a priori, that is:(4.6)π(β)∼Nd(L−1)(β0,B0),and the conjugate a posteriori distributions follow a multivariate normal distribution:(4.7)π(β|y1,y2,…,yN)=β*ˆ∼Nd(L−1)(β*,B),with mean and covariance matrix (Lindley and Smith, 1972; Smith, 1973; Frühwirth-Schnatter and Frühwirth, 2012):(4.8)β*=B(B0−1β0+∑n=1NXnTRn−1yn)(4.9)B=(B0−1+∑n=1NXnTRn−1Xn)−1.where N is the number of the observations of the land-use areas available at a coarse-scale. In our case, it represents the number of land-use areas available in a given administrative region (NUTS2 region). The (L − 1 × 1) vector yn, n = 1,2,…,N is the logarithm of the proportion of each observation of the land-use area with respect to the area of the referenced category. The matrix Xnis the input variable related to the observation yn. It is obtained as an average of the input variables for all the Hn-HSUs that belong to the sub-region where the observation ynhas been made (see equation (4.3)).We summarize and motivate the assumptions and the approximations made in this section in Table 2. With regard to the invariance of natural patterns in the environment, the hypotheses in Table 2 are equivalent to assume that the logarithm of the relative proportions are scale invariant with respect to all the input variables used in this paper. Indeed, given the model parameters, the transformation of the land-use areas in a given HSU zhis linear with respect to all the inputs Xhand it is known that a linear function is scale invariant (see Mandelbrot, 1983; Sellers et al., 1997; Li, 2000). Moreover, the scale invariant properties come from the distribution properties of Zhin equation (4.2) and Ynin equation (4.3) which is the mean of Zhacross a given region and both have the same distribution (see Li, 2000).Based on equations (4.1) and (4.7), the unconstrained Bayes predictor of the land-use shareSh,lˆ(see remark 4.1) is:(4.10)Sh,lˆ=exp(β*ˆlTxh)∑l=1Lexp(β*ˆlTxh).LetSlˆ=[S1,lˆ,…,Sh,lˆ,…,SHn,lˆ]Tbe a (Hn× 1) vector of the Bayes predictors of the land-use shares across all the HnHSU units that belong to a given coarse-scale unit. LetSˆ=[S1ˆT,…,SlˆT,…,SL−1ˆT]Tbe a ((L − 1)Hn× 1) vector of all the Bayes predictors of land-use shares. The vectorSˆ(β*ˆ)is a random vector and the optimal and unconstrained predictor of the shares isE[Sˆ|β*ˆ]when we consider the general mean square error to measure the performance of a predictor. The general mean square error ofSˆis defined asMSE(Sˆ)=E[(Sˆ−s)TW(Sˆ−s)], with W a symmetric matrix and s the true and unknown shares.In practice, we would require minimize the mean square error under some constraints on the predicted shares. In the case of land-use, the most important constraints are:•C1: the weighted sum of the shares of a land-use (l) across all HSUs must match with the area of that land-use observed at a coarse-scale unit (Al,n) with l = 1,2,…,L − 1 and n = 1,2,…,N;C2: the sum of the crop shares within a HSU must be less than 1 − sh.fore, with sh.forethe known percentage of the forest as we can also have other land-use type L;C3: the shares must be positive to avoid getting some negative land-use area.Let S be a vector of constrained shares ofSˆ. We can summarize all possible and compatible constraints in one equation like:(4.11)CS−c≥0where C is the constraint matrix (see Appendix C), containing the weights applied for constraining the predictors and the row number of C is the number of constraints. We use c as the constrained values, mainly the shares available at a coarse-scale. For more detail see Appendix C.The following proposition provides the optimal and constrained predictor of the shares.Proposition 4.1Assume thatSˆ, Shave a second moment;SlikeSˆis a function ofβ*ˆ;CS − c≥0 is a set of compatible constraints and the constraint region is bounded. If we use the generalized mean square error as the performance criterion of a predictor, we have:(i)the conditional, optimal and constrained predictor of the shares (S˜) is the solution of the quadratic programming (QP) problem:(4.12)S˜=argminS12STWS−STWSˆ(4.13)subjecttoCS−c≥0.(ii)IfWis a positive definite matrix, we have a strictly convex QP problem and this problem has an unique and global solution.See proof inAppendix D.In this paper, we use a local multinomial logit regression to get the empirical priors of the model parameters and, as in classical analysis, we assign a multivariate normal distribution for the estimator of the model parameters. The local multinomial logit regression allows for preserving the (local) environmental properties and it consists in regressing the vector of point-based observations on the explanatory variables by giving high weight to the observations close to the center of a desirable administrative region (NUTS2 in this paper) and low weight to other points (for more details see Appendix E, Lamboni et al., 2013, 2014a; Lamboni, 2013; Lamboni et al., 2014a). The weight is based on i) the distance between the center of the NUTS2 and the point-based observation; ii) a potential bandwidth, i.e. the maximum distance for which the weight is not zero.The set of the potential bandwidths (distance values), used to build the model at each NUTS2 region, are the same for each country and are listed in Table E.3 (Appendix E) according to our previous tests. The optimal bandwidth for a given NUTS2 region is chosen among the set of potential bandwidths. The optimal bandwidths for two or more NUTS2 regions can be different. Table E.3 in Appendix E reports the minimum and the maximum values of the optimal bandwidths determined by the model for each country. These optimal bandwidths are used to identify the LUCAS point-based observations and the associated input variables to be included in the model and then to get the prior estimates of the model parameters. For a selected optimal bandwidth (optimal LUCAS data), we assign a non-informative prior estimates for all the possible land-use classes which are not found in that LUCAS data. For these land-use classes, we assigned zero to the means of a priori distributions of the model parameters and we used the highest value of the standard deviations found in this region as standard deviations.All the LUCAS data and the associated input variables from 2001 up to 2009 were used to get a priori distributions of the model parameters.During the second step of the Bayesian estimation, we used the input variables for 2009 and the land-use areas for 2010 (FSS data). Based on formulas in (4.8), each observation of land-use areas at a NUTS3 levelAn=([A1,n,…,Al,n,…,AL,n]T)is transformed to get:yn=[log(A1,nAL,n),…,log(Al,nAL,n),…,log(AL−1,nAL,n)]T. The associated input variables at NUTS3 level (Xn) are the average of the input variables at the HSU level (Xh).For Germany, we did the same but at NUTS2 level as the observations of land-use areas are available at a NUTS2 level.Notice that we did not use the direct land-use areas (An) but a transformation of these areas. We used 10−4 as zero ha to avoid the logarithm transformation of values that include zero. The Bayesian estimates of the model parameters were obtained by applying the formulas in (4.8).Given the Bayesian estimates of the model parameters and the input variables at a HSU level, we ran the model (equation (4.1)) to get the predictions of the land-use shares or areas within the HSUs.In this step, we used the direct land-use areas (An) and the predictions from the model (equation (4.1)). We constrained the predictions in each HSU according to the Proposition 4.1 using the observed Anof the NUTS3 region for all EU countries except Germany. For Germany, we used Anof the NUTS2 region.To get the predictions uncertainties, we have to run the model for different values of the model parameters choosing within the posterior distributions of model parameters (equation (4.7)).To better sample within the parameters space, we firstly selected the most influential model parameters using sensitivity analysis (Saltelli et al., 2008; Lamboni et al., 2008, 2009, 2011b) as we have about 900 parameters in a NUTS2 region. The total sensitivity index of a given parameter (βj,l, j = 1, …, d and l = 1, …,L − 1) for the linear model with multiple outputs (Yn=[Yn,1=xnTβl,…,Yn,L−1=xnTβL−1]T) in equation (4.3) is (Lamboni et al., 2008, 2009, 2011a):(5.14)ST·j,l=∑l=1L−1xn,j2Var(βj,l)∑l=1L−1Var(Yn,l),where xn,jis the input variable associated to parameter βj,lfor a category of land-use l;Var(βj,l)is the variance of βj,landVar(Yn,l)is the variance of the output Yn,l.Secondly, we sampled 50 values of he most influential parameters (about 5 %) within the posterior distributions of these parameters and we fixed the other parameters to their mean values in (4.7) (Lamboni et al., 2009, 2014b).Thirdly, we ran the model for each of the sample values and computed the confident interval of the predicted land-use areas within HSUs (Lamboni et al., 2014b).In this section, we discuss the predicted results of the land-use areas in order to give some evidences about the level of accuracy of the model predictions and to draw some perspectives for further improvement of the model. First, we show that our predictions match with the FSS data as we are going to use these data for the validations and for some comparisons; and second, we assess the quality of the results for France for which data on crop areas at the HSU level are available (Cantelaube and Carles, 2015), and third, we represent the spatial distribution of barley to illustrate the results. We also compare our results to those obtained from few years ago (Kempen et al., 2005; Leip et al., 2008) to discuss some benefits and disadvantages of both results.As expected, the predicted land-use areas are consistent with the FSS data. Appendix F shows the quantiles of the predicted areas versus observed areas (Q-Q plots) at NUTS2 (resp. NUTS3) level for 30 possible land-uses in Germany (resp. France).
