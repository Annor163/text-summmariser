Background and objectiveInjury of knee joint cartilage may result in pathological vibrations between the articular surfaces during extension and flexion motions. The aim of this paper is to analyze and quantify vibroarthrographic (VAG) signal irregularity associated with articular cartilage degeneration and injury in the patellofemoral joint.MethodsThe symbolic entropy (SyEn), approximate entropy (ApEn), fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), and the mean, standard deviation, and root-mean-squared (RMS) values of the envelope amplitude, were utilized to quantify the signal fluctuations associated with articular cartilage pathology of the patellofemoral joint. The quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), generalized logistic regression analysis (GLRA), and support vector machine (SVM) methods were used to perform signal pattern classifications.ResultsThe experimental results showed that the patients with cartilage pathology (CP) possess larger SyEn and ApEn, but smaller FuzzyEn, over the statistical significance level of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (p<0.01), than the healthy subjects (HS). The mean, standard deviation, and RMS values computed from the amplitude difference between the upper and lower signal envelopes are also consistently and significantly larger (p<0.01) for the group of CP patients than for the HS group. The SVM based on the entropy and envelope amplitude features can provide superior classification performance as compared with QDA and GLRA, with an overall accuracy of 0.8356, sensitivity of 0.9444, specificity of 0.8, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.6599, and an area of 0.9212 under the receiver operating characteristic curve.ConclusionsThe SyEn, ApEn, and FuzzyEn features can provide useful information about pathological VAG signal irregularity based on different entropy metrics. The statistical parameters of signal envelope amplitude can be used to characterize the temporal fluctuations related to the cartilage pathology.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The knee joints bear almost the entire weight of the human body in daily activities, and they are vulnerable to different types of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis [1]. Osteoarthritis could be the consequence of joint degeneration due to overloading activities with an aging phenomenon or physical injury in strenuous exercises [2]. Articular cartilage pathology is one of the most common degenerative disorders that may lead to the development of osteoarthritis in knees.In most circumstances, a healthy knee with well-lubricated articular cartilage surfaces and intact menisci can perform smooth flexion and extension motions [3]. However, various pathological conditions of the knee joint, including chondromalacia, ruptured ligaments, and meniscal tears, may cause friction and grinding vibrations when the joint is articulated during daily activities such as walking, squatting, and swinging movement of the leg. The acceleration and vibratory signals of the knee joint, which are also referred to as vibroarthrographic (VAG) signals [4], can be recorded by inertial accelerometers in vibration arthrometry examinations [5]. Shark et al. [6] pointed out that the knee acoustic emission biomarkers are useful for quantitative assessment of joint degeneration, because the pathological VAG signals of knee-joint disorders commonly manifest different types of waveform complexity and frequency variations.Recently, a number of published research works have advanced digital signal processing and pattern analysis technologies for VAG signal analysis. Rangayyan et al. [7] designed the autoregressive model to parameterize the stochastic process and the nonstationary nature of VAG signal segments. Krishnan et al. [8] and Kim et al. [9] computed optimized time-frequency distributions of VAG signals, and extracted the energy, energy spread, frequency, and frequency spread parameters to characterize the time-frequency variability of pathological signals. Rangayyan and Wu [10–12] proposed several temporal VAG signal features, such as form factor, variance of mean-squared (VMS) values, and signal turns count, along with a number of statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis, Shannon information entropy, and Kullback–Leibler distance based on nonparametric Parzen-window probability density functions of VAG signals. Tanaka and Hoshiyama [13,14] compared the VAG signals of patients with high stages of osteoarthritis and those of age-matched healthy control subjects during standing-up and sitting-down movements, and reported that the powers of root-mean-squared (RMS) values are significantly greater in the frequency bands of 50–99Hz and 100–149Hz for symptomatic osteoarthritis knee joints. Rangayyan et al. [15] used the 1/f fractal model to compute the fractal dimension parameters of power spectral density from different segments of VAG signals. Baczkowicz et al. [16,17] studied age-dependent patellofemoral joint impairment by analyzing the VMS, entropy, difference between mean of four maximum and mean of four minimum values (R4), and the spectral power sums in two frequency bands of 50–250Hz (P1) and 250–450Hz (P2). Yang et al. [18] applied the detrended fluctuation analysis algorithm to derive the fractal scaling index parameter for quantification of intrinsic correlated signal fluctuations. The experimental results of Yang et al. [18] also showed that the pathological VAG signals of knee-joint disorders are commonly associated with significantly larger averaged envelope amplitude than the signals of healthy knees.So far, plenty of previous works on screening of abnormal VAG signals associated with knee-joint disorders have been reported in the literature [19–25], there still calls for more computational methods for better quantification of knee-joint pathology. The aim of our present work only focuses on the analysis and quantification of VAG signal irregularity associated with articular cartilage degeneration and injury in the patellofemoral joint. We computed the symbolic entropy (SyEn), approximate entropy (ApEn), and fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) parameters to quantify the intrinsic irregularity in pathological VAG signals, and also measured three distinct envelope amplitude (EA) features to characterize the waveform variations and fluctuations in the time scale. Based on the entropy and envelope features, signal patterns can be effectively distinguished by using nonlinear classifiers.We recruited 73 subjects to participate in the VAG signal acquisition experiments. The healthy subject (HS) group is composed of 55 control adults (28 males and 27 females) with normal knee-joint conditions, as confirmed by routine physical examinations and medical history records. The patient group consists of 18 subjects (9 males and 9 females) with cartilage pathology (CP) in their patellofemoral joints, the pathological conditions of which were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging examinations. The symptoms of the patients with cartilage disorders mainly contain chondromalacia patellae (CMP), softening of articular cartilage, and patellofemoral arthritis. Eleven CMP patients are with Grade I (3 cases, 2 males and 1 female), Grade II (3 cases, 3 females), Grade III (2 cases, 1 male and 1 female), and Grade IV (3 cases, 2 males and 1 female). There are 2 patients (1 male and 1 female) with articular cartilage softening, and 5 patients (3 males and 2 females) with patellofemoral arthritis. Patients suffering from other knee-joint disorders, such as meniscal tears and cruciate ligament injury, were excluded in the data acquisition experiments, because we just concentrated on the VAG signal irregularity as a result of the vibrations associated with articular cartilage disorders. All participants were able to voluntarily perform knee extension and flexion motions. The CP patients who cannot perform the knee extension motion from 90° to 0° or flexion motion from 0° to 90° as required by the experimental protocol were excluded in the present work. The age of the HS group (mean: 35.1 years; standard deviation, SD: 8.5 years) was comparable with that of the CP group (mean: 34.6 years; SD: 12.1 years). The subjects provided their informed and written consent documents as approved by the Ethics Committee of Xiamen University.In the VAG signal acquisition experiments, the subjects sat on a rigid chair with both legs freely suspended in air, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Two triaxial accelerometer sensors (Model: xyzPlux, dimensions: 9mm×21mm×4mm, weight: 1.9g, PLUX Wireless Biosignals S.A., Lisbon, Portugal) were attached using two-sided adhesive tape on the proximal and middle positions of the patella, respectively. All subjects followed the experimental protocol to perform the knee motions of 90–0° extension and 0–90° flexion in the duration of 4s (see Fig. 1). The raw VAG time series were recorded by the accelerometer (named as Sensor-I) at the middle-patella position, and the signals collected by the other accelerometer (named as Sensor-II) at the proximal-patella position were used to cancel the motion artifacts during knee motions. The signals were amplified by using a lightweight portable signal acquisition hub (Model: bioPLUX, dimensions: 82mm×54mm×15mm, weight: 46g, PLUX Wireless Biosignals S.A., Lisbon, Portugal). The signal data were acquired at the sampling rate of 1 kHz and wirelessly transferred to a computer with the Bluetooth v4.0 module, and digitized with a resolution of 12bits per sample using the OpenSignals software platform (PLUX Wireless Biosignals S.A., Lisbon, Portugal). The digital values of each signal were converted into the amplitude unit of gravity force (1g=9.81m/s2).In order to obtain high-quality VAG signals, we performed the necessary signal preprocessing procedures to remove the artifacts in the raw data. Motion artifacts in the VAG time series recorded from Sensor-I were canceled with the trend reference adaptively estimated from the signal recorded by Sensor-II. Baseline wander was eliminated in each VAG signal by using a cascade moving average filter [26]. Reduction of random noise was achieved with the combination of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition and detrended fluctuation analysis methods [27].We computed three entropy parameters, i.e., the SyEn, ApEn, and FuzzyEn, and three envelope parameters, i.e., the mean, SD, and RMS values of envelope amplitude, as the distinct features to characterize the irregular complexity of pathological VAG signals.The SyEn parameter represents the coarse graining of signal dynamics in a physiological process. Fig. 2shows the signal symbolization procedures of quantization, word sequence segmentation, and entropy computation based on the probability density of words.A temporal signal {x(n)}, 1≤n≤N, is required to be transformed into a number of symbol sequences {sq(n)}, with a predefined amplitude threshold δ. The quantization parameter q determines the number of quantization levels for the conversion from the given signal to a symbol sequence. In the present work, the quantization parameter was set to be q=2 such that the VAG signals can be symbolized as(1)sq(n)=0,|x(n)−x¯|<δ,1,|x(n)−x¯|≥δ,wherex¯is the mean of the VAG signal.Typically, a word is defined to contain a sequential set of M signal symbols assMq(n)={sq(n),sq(n+1),…,sq(n+M−1)}. With the word length M, the total number of possible words that can appear in the symbol sequence is W=qM. The probability of occurrence of each word is estimated throughout the entire symbol sequence{sMq(n)}such that the probability density functions can be established. Then, the Shannon entropy can be calculated as(2)Hs(q,M)=−∑b=1WPb(sMq)log2[Pb(sMq)],wherePb(sMq)is the probability of occurrence of a specified word.Eguia et al. [28] reported that the empirical probability estimates ofPb(sMq)may be biased due to systematic errors. Therefore, they proposed a correction to Shannon entropy by an additional bias term as [28](3)Hc(q,M)=Hs(q,M)+WR−12Wloge2,where WR is the total number of words that actually appear in the symbol sequence{sMq(n)}. In this case, when the word probability follows a uniform distribution, the maximum value of the corrected Shannon entropy can be derived as(4)Hcmax(q,M)=log2W+W−12Wloge2.In order to ensure that the entropy values computed from two words with the same threshold and quantization parameters but different word length L are also comparable, Aziz and Arif [29] suggested that the corrected Shannon entropy should be normalized to produce the SyEn as(5)SyEn(q,M)=Hc(q,M)Hcmax(q,M)=Hs(q,M)+(WR−1)/(2Wloge2)log2W+(W−1)/(2Wloge2).In the present study, we set the word length parameter to be M=4 such that the total number of possible words is W=24=16. The optimal threshold parameter was determined as δ=0.2g, which was selected according to the smallest p value of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (level of significant difference in statistics: p<0.01, implemented with IBM SPSS® Statistics, Version 20).The ApEn parameter is a statistical measure proposed by Pincus [30], with the purpose of parameterizing the irregular dynamics in biomedical signals. Given an N-length signal, {x(n)}, the ApEn(i, t, N) model involves a positive integeri∈ℤ+as the window length for similarity comparison, and a positive real valuet∈R+as the tolerance threshold for similarity matching acceptance [31]. Let us define a vector sequence u1(n), u2(n), …, u(N−i+1)(n), where each vector ui(n)=[x(n), x(n+1), …, x(n+i−1)] consists of i consecutive samples in the VAG signal. Then, we may calculate the maximum distance d[ui(j), ui(k)], 1≤j, k≤N−i+1, between the elements from the vectors of ui(j) and ui(k) [32], as(6)d[ui(j),ui(k)]=maxl=1,2,…,ix(j+l−1)−x(k+l−1).LetCji(t)denote the probability of k satisfying the condition that the distance d[ui(j), ui(k)] is smaller than t, as(7)Cji(t)=numberofksatisfyingd[ui(j),ui(k)]<tN−i+1,which indicates the frequency of similarity between the vector ui(k) and a given template ui(j) within a tolerance threshold t. Define the function φi(t) as the average of the natural logarithm values ofCji(t)[33]:(8)φi(t)=∑j=1N−i+1logeCji(t)N−i+1.For a signal of a finite length, the corresponding approximate entropy, ApEn(i, t, N), can be computed as [31](9)ApEn(i,t,N)=φi(t)−φi+1(t)=∑j=1N−i+1logeCji(t)N−i+1−∑j=1N−ilogeCji+1(r)N−i.In general, a larger ApEn value indicates a relatively higher degree of irregularity or complexity in the signal.In the present work, the ApEn model was used to parameterize the temporal regularity of VAG signals. The optimal combination of the ApEn parameters i=4 and t=0.2g was obtained based on the results of the Wilcoxon rank-sum hypothesis test with the smallest p value (statistical significance level: p<0.01). The signal length N=4000 was identical for each VAG signal.The FuzzyEn is a useful parameter that measures the self-similarity in a given signal {x(n)} with a predefined fuzzy membership function [34,35]. Let us define a vector sequence,yi(n)=[x(n),x(n+1),…,x(n+i−1)]−x¯i(n), wherex¯i(n)=(1/i)∑l=0i−1x(n+l)is the baseline within l signal samples such that each vector yi(n) is free of local trend. The distance between yi(j) and yi(k) is measured with the maximum absolute differencedj,ki=d[yi(j),yi(k)]express as(10)dj,ki=d[yi(j),yi(k)]=maxl=0,…,i−1|[x(j+l)−x¯i(j)]−[x(k+l)−x¯i(k)]|Then, similarity degree is computed using an exponential formulaμ(dj,ki,m,r)as the fuzzy membership function of the maximum distance, i.e.,(11)Dj,ki(m,r)=μ(dj,ki,m,r)=exp−(dj,ki)mr.We may define a function ϕi(m, r) to average all similarity measuresDj,ki(m,r)of a sequence of vectors yi(j) as(12)ϕi(m,r)=1N−i∑j=1N−i1N−i−1∑k=1,k≠jN−iDj,ki(m,r),(13)ϕi+1(m,r)=1N−i∑j=1N−i1N−i−1∑k=1,k≠jN−iDj,ki+1(m,r)For a signal {x(n)} with the finite length N, the FuzzyEn is computed as(14)FuzzyEn(i,m,r,N)=logeϕi(m,r)−logeϕi+1(m,r)We computed the FuzzyEn model with an exponential function as the fuzzy membership measure to represent the temporal complexity of VAG signals. The FuzzyEn embedding dimension was i=4, and the exponential function parameters were set to be m=2 and r=0.1×SD, where SD is the standard deviation of the VAG signal to be analyzed.Signal envelopes can be used to outline the temporal oscillations with large amplitude changes due to the vibrations occurring when areas of degenerated cartilage contact on the articular surfaces of a pathological knee joint [18]. In order to obtain the upper and lower envelopes in each VAG signal, we divided the signal into sequential non-overlapping segments, with an equal length of 20 samples for each. The local upper extreme (the highest peak) and the local lower extreme (the lowest trough) were then detected in each signal segment. Based on the local extremes detected, the samples between the sequential local extremes were estimated using the piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation method from one segment to another, for the upper and lower envelopes, respectively.The EA feature is defined as the temporal difference between the upper and lower envelopes [18]. In the present study, the mean and SD values of EA were computed over the entire VAG signal for each subject. The RMS value of EA was also computed for each VAG signal as a measure of averaged signal power magnitude over a sample. As the statistical parameters that characterize the signal fluctuations associated with knee cartilage pathological conditions, the mean, SD, and RMS values of EA were used in the following pattern classification tasks, and denoted as EA-Mean, EA-SD, and EA-RMS, respectively.Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) does not require the prior assumption that two subject groups have identical covariance matrices. The QDA method is the general form of Bayesian classification with a quadratic discriminant function that contains the second-order term as(15)Jc(y)=−12loge∑c−12(y−μc)T∑c−1(y−μc)+logeπc,where ∑crepresents the covariance matrix of each subject group (c∈{HS, CP}), μcis the group center (the mean vector of multivariate features), and πcdenotes the prior probability of each group (55/73 = 0.7534 and 18/73 = 0.2466 for the HS and CP subject groups, respectively). The signal pattern is categorized into the group c which maximizes the quadratic discriminant function, i.e., argmaxJc(y). The QDA method allows flexibility for unequal covariance matrices of different classes, so it can fit imbalanced data better than linear discriminant analysis in practical applications. However, the QDA demands more computing resources to estimate the parameters in quadratic discrimination for each class.Generalized logistic regression analysis (GLRA) is a type of generalized linear modeling method that incorporates a multivariate linear model and a random variable to describe the systematic and random effects, respectively [36]. Because the VAG signal patterns belong to the groups of HS (with negative class label: −1) and CP (with positive class label: +1) subjects, a random variable with the Bernoulli distribution was chosen to compute the probabilities of the binomial groups. For the GLRA method, we used the logit link function, in the form of the natural logarithm of an odds ratio, to interpret the binomial relationship between the multivariate features and the estimated class probabilities p and 1−p, i.e.,(16)logep1−p=yTβ=β0+y1β1+⋯+yfβf,where the vectorβ=[β0, β1, …, βf]Tdenotes the regression model coefficients, and y=[1, y1, …, yf]Tis the GLRA input vector. In the present work, the input vector contains unity and the six features of SyEn, ApEn, FuzzyEn, EA-Mean, EA-SD, and EA-RMS. We applied the iterative weighted least-squares procedure [37] to compute the maximum likelihood estimates of the GLRA coefficients. The optimal GLRA regression coefficients wereβ*=[22.55, 30.73, 648.06, −108.41, −331.32, −464.82, 482.1]T, which is expected to help the GLRA achieve the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.We employed the support vector machine (SVM) to perform nonlinear classification of VAG signal patterns. The SVM is an artificial neural network paradigm that is established with the Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension theory to avoid the curse of dimensionality problem [38]. The SVM searches for a number of training data patterns as informative support vectors to construct a maximal margin hyperplane between different classes. For nonlinearly separable data, the SVM projects its inputs onto a high-dimensional space using nonlinear kernel functions, and then adjusts the mapped patterns to be linearly separable with several slack variables.The optimization of the SVM network is equivalent to a quadratic programming problem in relation to the objective function of maximum margin and the modified equality constraints with slack variables. Then, the optimal solutions of SVM parameters can be obtained by solving the dual quadratic programming problem with Lagrange multipliers under the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition [39].The features sent to the SVM inputs were the SyEn, ApEn, FuzzyEn, EA-Mean, EA-SD, and EA-RMS, the same as for the GLRA method. The nonlinear mapping of input features to the high-dimensional space was performed with the Gaussian kernel function as κ(y, yf)=exp(−∥y−yf∥2/σ2). We searched the spread parameter σ from 1 to 100 in our experiments, and selected the optimal value of σ=5 that could assist the SVM to achieve the largest value of area under the ROC curve.In order to test the generalization ability of the aforementioned classification methods, we applied the leave-one-out cross-validation approach for classification performance evaluation. In each cross-validation step, one signal pattern is excluded from the classifier training process and then distinguished separately. Such steps proceed until all signal patterns have been categorized one by one.The ROC curves were generated for the pattern classifiers, and the areas under the curve (AUC) were estimated to represent the diagnostic performance. The optimal cutoff point in the ROC curve for the binary classification decision of each classifier was determined according to the maximum value of Youden's index [40], J, i.e.,(17)maxJ=Sensitivity+Specificity−1.The confusion matrix was calculated for each classification method, with the ratios of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN). The classification results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy were derived from the confusion matrix.In addition, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) [41] was calculated as a classification quality indicator for performance evaluation:(18)MCC=TP×TN−FP×FNP(1−P)S(1−S),(19)P=(TP+FP)/(TP+FP+TN+FN),(20)S=(TP+FN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN).The MCC parameter has the major advantage of involving all the true and false positives and negatives in the correlation coefficient form to provide the evaluation of binary classification outcomes [41]. Typically, a zero MCC value implies that a binary classification is equivalent to random guess. A positive value of MCC indicates proper classification, and perfect classification is achieved when MCC is equal to +1. On the other hand, a negative MCC value represents a poor classification worse than random guess (MCC = −1 denotes a total disagreement between the predicted and actual groups).
