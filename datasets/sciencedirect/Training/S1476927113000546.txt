@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this manuscript, we present a computational model to approximate the solutions of a partial differential equation which describes the growth dynamics of microbial films. The numerical technique reported in this work is an explicit, nonlinear finite-difference methodology which is computationally implemented using Newton's method. Our scheme is compared numerically against an implicit, linear finite-difference discretization of the same partial differential equation, whose computer coding requires an implementation of the stabilized bi-conjugate gradient method. Our numerical results evince that the nonlinear approach results in a more efficient approximation to the solutions of the biofilm model considered, and demands less computer memory. Moreover, the positivity of initial profiles is preserved in the practice by the nonlinear scheme proposed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the last decade, there has been an increasing interest on the investigation of the growth dynamics of microbial biofilms, both to understand comprehensively the physical and the mathematical principles that govern biofilm growth, and to elucidate possible, relevant biomedical and biotechnological applications. Undoubtedly, biological films entail both an economic and a biological importance. Indeed, nowadays biofilms are considered a common cause of persistent infections; for instance, the Chinese National Institute of Health has estimated that at least 65% of all bacterial infections in humans are related to certain types of biological colonies (Chen et al., 2012). In addition, several nosocomial infections are presumed to be the result of the presence of pathogenic films in a wide range of medical devices, like catheters and probes used in different hospital services. It is worthwhile to recall that microbial colonies in general are highly organized structures integrated by communities which are surrounded by a protective extracellular matrix. This important feature makes them resistant to both antibiotic treatment and host defense systems.On the other hand, microbial films can grow in many different natural and no-natural environments, and may be considered benign or detrimental depending upon its place of growth. Biological films may be conformed by a single or by multiple species with different metabolic mechanisms which, in many cases, function as cooperative consortia. Here, it is important to mention that these cooperative consortia have encountered useful practical applications in the treatment of polluted water (Cao et al., 2012; Castillo et al., 2011; Ellwood et al., 2011; Jiao et al., 2011), in the development of microbial fuel cells to produce electricity (Jain et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2008, 2010; Yang et al., 2011), in the design of biosensors (Checa et al., 2012; Velusamy et al., 2010), among other applications of practical relevance. However, there are also scenarios in which the formation of biological films results in the deterioration of surfaces due to the microbial-influenced corrosion (Upadhyayula and Gadhamshetty, 2010; Little et al., 2008). Despite the many efforts to simulate and understand the complex nature of microbial aggregates, there still exists the need to explore deeper into the many variables that accompany this mechanism. For instance, the influence of self-generated attractants on Escherichia coli clustering has been studied in Kim et al. (2007). In that report, a discrete model was used to investigate the role of parameters such as chemotaxis sensitivity, geometry and initial conditions, in order to describe the joint dynamics of bacteria and attractants.From a more mathematical point of view, the models which describe the growth dynamics of biological film are mainly provided in the form of systems of partial differential equations with nonlinear diffusion and reaction terms (Efendiev et al., 2002). Some of these mathematical models take into account the most important features of biological films observed in the practice, like(a)the presence of a sharp front of biomass at the fluid/solid transition,the existence of a threshold of biomass density,the fact that the biomass spreading is significant only when the biomass is close to the threshold,the application of reaction kinetics mechanisms in the production of biomass,the compatibility of the biomass spreading mechanism with hydrodynamics and with nutrient transfer/consumption models,In view of such mathematical limitations, several computational approaches have been taken to simulate the growth dynamics of microbial colonies. For instance, some related techniques are based on stochastic computational modeling (McCollum et al., 2006). For deterministic models, the finite-difference approach has been proposed in works like Eberl et al. (2001), and some differential-discrete cellular automata have been employed with success in the growth of gel beads (Picioreanu et al., 1998, 1999). The finite-element and the finite-volume methodologies have proved fruitful, too, like in Duddu et al. (2008), Böl et al. (2008), Smith et al. (2007) or Gallo and Manzini (2003), Picioreanu et al. (2000), Szego et al. (1993), respectively.In the present work, we employ a finite-difference approach to approximate solutions of a nonlinear partial differential equation in the investigation of biological films. More concretely, our investigation is partly motivated by the results presented in Eberl et al. (2001), which reports on a successful finite-difference discretization of a nonlinear equation from mathematical ecology, which is capable of preserving the positivity of the approximations among other relevant mathematical characteristics of the solutions. The discretization introduced in that work is an implicit, linear approach whose implementation is provided in terms of a sparse matrix with number of rows equal to the discrete grid size. The preservation of the properties of positivity and boundedness is achieved using the theory of M-matrices, which are non-singular, real matrices for which the entries of their inverses are all positive numbers (Fujimoto and Ranade, 2004). The method works at the expense of large computational memory and lengthy simulation times. In the present work, however, we provide an explicit, nonlinear finite-difference technique to approximate the solutions of the same model investigated in Eberl et al. (2001) but, as the numerical simulations show, our approach is computationally faster and absorbs less computational resources.The present manuscript is divided as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the mathematical model of interest in this work. We present therein some relevant results on the existence and uniqueness of positive and bounded solutions of the biofilm equation under investigation. In Section 3, we introduce the finite-difference discretization of our model. The method is an explicit, nonlinear technique whose computational realization requires a convenient implementation of Newton's method for solving nonlinear equations. Section 4 presents some simulations that evince the fact that the method is capable of preserving the property of positivity in the practice. Finally, we close this manuscript with some discussions and some concluding remarks.Let Ω be a closed and connected subset ofℝ2orℝ3, and letu:Ω×ℝ+→ℝbe a function. Throughout this work, we suppose that α, β and γ are positive real numbers, such that α>1, β>1 and γ≪1. In this manuscript, we consider the partial differential equation with nonlinear diffusion factor(1)∂u∂t(x,t)=∇·D(u(x,t))∇u(x,t)+G(x,t)u(x,t),where(x,t)∈Ω×ℝ+, and ∇ denotes the gradient operator in the spatial domain. Here, the reaction functionG:Ω×ℝ+→ℝis continuous, and the diffusion factorD:[0,1)→ℝis provided by the expression(2)D(u)=δuα(1−u)β.Evidently, the variable x represents spatial position, while t denotes time.Eq. (1) is a simplified version of the growth model investigated in Eberl et al. (2001). Indeed, let s0 and u0 be real functions defined on Ω, and consider the spatially two- or three-dimensional equation(3)∂s∂t(x,t)=d1∇2s(x,t)−K1s(x,t)u(x,t)K4+s(x,t),∂u∂t(x,t)=d2∇·D(u(x,t)∇u(x,t))−K2u+K3s(x,t)u(x,t)K4+s(x,t),for every(x,t)∈Ω×ℝ+. Appropriate initial-boundary conditions are required, namely,(4)s(x,t)=1,u(x,t)=0,∀x∈∂Ω,∀t≥0,s(x,0)=s0(x),u(x,0)=u0(x),∀x∈Ω.In this model, s physically represents the substrate concentration and u denotes the biomass density. The non-negative constants d1, d2, K1, K2, K3 and K4 stand for the substrate diffusion coefficient, the biomass diffusion coefficient, the maximum specific consumption rate, the biomass decay rate, the maximum specific growth rate, and the monod half saturation constant.The following theorem guarantees the existence and the uniqueness of positive and bounded solutions of (3) subject to the initial-boundary constraints (4). In the statement, F is the real function defined on [0, 1) through the expression(5)F(u)=∫0uvβ(1−v)αdv.The proof follows from Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 of Efendiev et al. (2002).Theorem 1Let s0and u0satisfy the conditions1.s0∈L∞(Ω)∩H1(Ω), and 0≤s0(x)≤1 for everyx∈Ω,u0∈L∞(Ω), andF(u0)∈H01(Ω), andu0(x)≥0 for everyx∈Ω, and‖u0‖L∞(Ω)<1.s,u∈L∞(Ω×ℝ+)∩C(L2(Ω),[0,∞)),s,F(u)∈L∞(H1(Ω),ℝ+)∩C(L2(Ω),[0,∞)), and0≤s(x, t), u(x, t)≤1 for every(x,t)∈Ω×ℝ+, and‖u‖L∞(Ω×ℝ+)<1.In our simulations, we will restrict to problems in which d1, K1 and K2 are all equal to zero. In such cases, the function s is clearly a constant, and system (3) reduces to the single equation (1) which, under the conditions provided by Theorem 1, has solutions which are bounded within [0, 1) almost everywhere.It is convenient to rewrite (1) in an alternative form. To that end, let us represent the coordinate spatial variables by xiwith i=1, 2, 3, in the three-dimensional scenario. Then, our model may be presented alternatively as(6)∂u∂t(x,t)=D′(u(x,t))∑i=13∂u(x,t)∂xi2+D(u(x,t))∑i=13∂2u∂xi2(x,t)+G(x,t)u(x,t),for every(x,t)∈Ω×ℝ+, where(7)D′(u)=δuα−1(α+(β−α)u)(1−u)β+1,for u∈[0, 1). Evidently, D′(u) is nonnegative for every u. This presentation of our mathematical model will be used for discretization purposes in the following section. For numerical purposes, we will impose homogeneous Neumann data at the boundary of Ω, and we will consider nonnegative initial profiles which are bounded from above by 1.We describe our method in the three-dimensional case, the description in lower dimensions is similar. Let Ω=[a, b]×[c, d]×[e, f] be a nonempty box inℝ3, and letM,N,P∈ℤ+. Take uniform partitions {xm:0≤m≤M}, {yn:0≤n≤N} and {zp:0≤p≤P} of [a, b], [c, d] and [e, f], respectively, with respective partition norms Δx=(b−a)/M, Δy=(d−c)/N and Δz=(f−e)/P. Temporally, suppose that Δt is a positive number, and let{tk}k=0∞be a uniform partition of the interval [0, ∞). Define the sets(8)Γ={(m,n,p,k):0≤m≤M,0≤n≤N,0≤p≤P,0≤k<∞},and(9)Γ′={(m,n,p,k):0<m<M,0<n<N,0<p<P,0≤k<∞}.We use the notationum,n,pkto represent the numerical approximation of the exact value of u at the point (xm, yn, zp, tk), for every (m, n, p, k)∈Γ. For convenience, we employ the linear operators,(10)δx(1)um,n,pk=um+1,n,pk−um−1,n,pk2Δx,(11)δy(1)um,n,pk=um,n+1,pk−um,n−1,pk2Δy,(12)δz(1)um,n,pk=um,n,p+1k−um,n,p−1k2Δz,(13)δt(1)um,n,pk=um,n,pk+1−um,n,pk−12Δt,which are, respectively, second-order approximations to the partial derivative of u with respect x, y, z and t, at the point (xm, yn, zp, tk), for every (m, n, p, k)∈Γ′. Additionally, we define(14)δtum,n,pk=um,n,pk+1−um,n,pkΔt,which is a first-order approximation of the partial derivative of u with respect to t at both (xm, yn, zp, tk) and (xm, yn, zp, tk+1). Moreover, let(15)δx(2)um,n,pk=um+1,n,pk−2um,n,pk+um−1,n,pk(Δx)2,(16)δy(2)um,n,pk=um,n+1,pk−2um,n,pk+um,n−1,pk(Δy)2,(17)δz(2)um,n,pk=um,n,p+1k−2um,n,pk+um,n,p−1k(Δz)2,which are respectively second-order estimations of the second-order partial derivative of u with respect to x, y and z, at (xm, yn, zp, tk), for every (m, n, p, k)∈Γ′. Finally, for every (m, n, p, k)∈Γ′, we introduce the operators(18)δu(1)Dm,n,pk=D(um,n,pk+1)−D(um,n,pk−1)um,n,pk+1−um,n,pk−1,(19)δuDm,n,pk=D(um,n,pk+1)−D(um,n,pk)um,n,pk+1−um,n,pk,(20)σu(1)Dm,n,pk=D(um,n,pk+1)+D(um,n,pk−1)2,(21)σuDm,n,pk=D(um,n,pk+1)+D(um,n,pk)2.With this notation, we propose the following nonstandard approximation to estimate the exact value of the solution u at (xm, yn, zp, tk+1), using the known approximations at time tk, for k≥1:(22)δt(1)um,n,pk−δu(1)Dm,n,pk∑w=x,y,zδw(1)um,n,pk2−σu(1)Dm,n,pk∑w=x,y,zδw(2)um,n,pk−Gm,n,pk+1um,n,pk=0.For k=0, we employ the discrete rule(23)δtum,n,p0=δuDm,n,p0∑w=x,y,zδw(1)um,n,p02+σuDm,n,p0∑w=x,y,zδw(2)um,n,p0+Gm,n,p1um,n,p0.The proposed method is evidently explicit, though nonlinear as its continuous counterpart. Its computational implementation requires the use of Newton's method for solving nonlinear equations. In order to avoid any computational indetermination and additional propagation of errors caused by divisions by relatively small numbers, we multiply Eq. (22) by the term(um,n,pk+1−um,n,pk−1)(1−um,n,pk+1)β+1, and Eq. (23) by(um,n,p1−um,n,p0)(1−um,n,p1)β+1.In the present section, we test the performance of the method in the modeling of the growth dynamics of biofilms. In particular, we would like to verify the capability of the method to preserve the positivity of solutions. Throughout, we will consider the mathematical model (1) with nonlinear reaction factor given by (2), where α=β=2 and δ=0.0001. For convenience, we explore the two-dimensional scenario in which Ω=[0, 1]×[0, 1]; computationally, we set Δx=Δy=0.02 and Δt=0.01, and we impose homogeneous Neumann conditions on the boundary of Ω. In the implementation of Newton's method, we fix a tolerance of 1×10−6, and a maximum number of iterations equal to 20.Our first example shows the capability of (22) to preserve the positivity of the approximate solutions when biomass is created. In all our simulations, the initial approximation to the solution in Newton's method at the (k+1)th iteration and the point (xm, yn, zp) is given by the numberum,n,pk−κ(um,n,pk−um,n,pk−1), for a suitable value of κ.Example 2Assume that G(x, t)=0.17, for every(x,t)∈Ω×ℝ+, and let κ=0.5. Consider the initial condition(24)u0(x)=∑l=1LCle−rl‖x−xl‖2,∀x∈Ω,where L=5; C1=0.025, C2=0.03, C3=0.035, C4=0.02, C5=0.025; r1=25, r2=50, r3=125, r4=100, r5=50; x1=(0.25, 0.3), x2=(0.5, 0.25), x3=(0.7, 0.65), x4=(0.4, 0.8), and x5=(0.5, 0.55). Fig. 1presents the checkerboard plots of the approximate solution using (22), at six different times, namely, t=5, 10, 15, 20. The quantitative results, as well as the qualitative ones, reflect the fact that the method preserves the positivity and the boundedness of the solutions. The merging of colonies is fully observed around the time t=20, and the numerical results exhibit stability in this case, even when different colonies begin to coalesce. □The following example establishes computationally the capacity of (22) to preserve the positivity of solutions when biomass is destroyed.Example 3Let G(x, t)=−0.17, for every(x,t)∈Ω×ℝ+, and let κ=0.5. Consider the initial condition (24) with parameters L=6, C1=0.5, C2=0.65, C3=0.55, C4=0.6, C5=0.4, C6=0.45; r1=100, r2=50, r3=30, r4=80, r5=90, r6=100; x1=(0.25, 0.3), x2=(0.5, 0.25), x3=(0.7, 0.65), x4=(0.4, 0.8), x5=(0.5, 0.55), x6=(0.8, 0.3). The corresponding solutions are decreasing in time in view that the rate of change of mass creation is negative, and the approximate solutions, depicted in Fig. 2as three-dimensional plots, reflect that behavior. It is worthwhile to observe that the solutions remain nonnegative at all time, even though the rate of change of biomass destruction is a negative constant at all times. This fact establishes the capability of the method to preserve the nonnegative character of meaningful solutions of (1). □In our last example, we consider a function G which asymptotically converges to 0, typical of a biofilm system which runs out of resources.Example 4In this example, we use the same initial profile considered in Example 2, and let κ=1. For our present example, we employ the reaction factor(25)G(x,t)=0.1625(1−tanh(t−5))2,defined for everyx∈Ω×ℝ+. Under these circumstances, Fig. 3presents the approximate solution of this problem at four different times, namely, t=0, 5, 10 and 20. The results show that the numerical solutions remain approximately constant after t=5. This is in agreement with the fact that the reaction factor G asymptotically converges to 0 after that instant of time. Fig. 4(a) presents the three-dimensional plot of the solution at time t=10 using our nonlinear method, while Fig. 4(b) presents the corresponding results obtained using the linear finite-difference method presented in Eberl et al. (2001). The results are qualitatively similar, as showed by the graphs. However, even when the computational parameters are the same, the method (22) demanded an average time of 11.2548s (computed from a total of 20 performances of the method), while the method presented in Eberl et al. (2001) took an average of 71.1033s in identical circumstances. □

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this work, we introduced a method to approximate solutions of a nonlinear, parabolic partial differential equation studied in the formation of microbial colonies. The proposed technique follows a nonstandard finite-difference methodology which results in an explicit nonlinear scheme. The computational coding requires of an implementation of Newton's method for approximating the roots of nonlinear algebraic equations. In this manuscript, we provided some computer simulations of the growth of biofilms. The numerical results evince that the computational model is capable of preserving the positivity and the boundedness of the approximations, which are highly desirable, physical characteristics that are present in some solutions of the mathematical model.The method was tested against a previously reported linear discretization of the model under investigation. The linear model is represented in vector form through the multiplication of a matrix which, under suitable and flexible circumstances, is an M-matrix, a fact that guarantees the preservation of the positivity and the boundedness of the approximations. The simulations obtained with the nonlinear scheme are in agreement with the results obtained through the linear discretization. However, as the simulations show, the nonlinear approach is capable of approximating solutions at lower computational cost in terms of both time and memory. Moreover, while the linear method is pragmatically obsolete in the two- and the three-dimensional scenarios, the nonlinear method is more practical. This is due to the fact that the matrix represented the linear system is a matrix in which most of the entries are equal to zero. These matrices appear in many types of problems (Korenblat et al., 2012; Smith and Stein, 2009), and their computational implementation often results in the use of a considerable amount of computer memory.
