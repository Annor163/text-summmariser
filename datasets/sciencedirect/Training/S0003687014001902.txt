@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study explored how usability was dealt with in four product development organizations active in different sectors: high-end automotive, professional printers and copiers, office coffee makers and fast moving consumer goods. The primary differentiators of the selected cases were whether they were targeting businesses or consumers and the degree of product complexity. Interviews with 19 product development practitioners were conducted, focussing on three topics: 1) the product development process and the integration of user involvement, 2) multidisciplinary teamwork, and 3) organizational attitude towards usability. Based on the interviews, context descriptions of the companies were created and barriers and enablers for usability were identified. To verify the findings and to discuss remaining issues a feedback workshop was held in which the primary contact from each company participated. The results indicate that differences in product–market combination lead to differences in organizational attitude towards usability. The prioritization of usability in an organization seems to be influenced by the degree of product complexity (complex products are more prone to suffer from usability issues) and whether developers think that usability is a purchase consideration for their clients. The product–market combination a company targets also affects the methods for user-centred design that a company can apply and that are relevant. What methods for user-centred design are used also seems to be influenced by the attitude towards usability: if usability is considered more important, methods that require more resources can be applied.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the past years the field of user-centred design has matured and a wealth of methodologies and methods for user-centred design (UCD) have been developed (e.g., Nielsen, 1992; Kanis, 1998; ISO, 1999; Fulton Suri and Marsh, 2000; Kwahk and Han, 2002; Martin and Hanington, 2012; Sanders and Stappers, 2012).However, despite all this knowledge and design methodology, products and services with poor usability are still entering the market (Jokela, 2004; Den Ouden et al., 2006; Pogue, 2006; Steger et al., 2007: p.825). A striking example is a new nationwide public transport RFID card that was introduced in the Netherlands in 2009. The system design and its implementation caused numerous usability problems, causing a public outcry about the poor usability of the system, and resistance against the introduction of the system.And the aforementioned example is not unique, by far. Online banking, car dashboards, medical devices. Some of these products and services are usable, quite a few are not. So in those cases, something must have gone wrong during development. Perhaps the methodologies and methods for user-centred design do not actually work in the way their authors claim they do? Can it be that the methods are not known in industry? Or may be the methods are not applied in practice because they don't take into account the context in which product development teams have to work?In any case, human-centred design practice turns out to be very different from UCD principles and theory (Norman, 1996; Wixon, 2003; Steen, 2008). To be effective ergonomists need to not just be very capable at solving ergonomic challenges, but also need to engage in the organisational and strategic aspects of product development (Hendrick, 2008; Dul and Neumann, 2009; Theberge and Neumann, 2010).Multiple authors stress that in academia there is not enough insight into the practical concerns of UCD and ergonomics practitioners, and that practice should be studied to understand the barriers and enablers for successful integration of UCD and ergonomics in product development (Grudin, 1991: p.435–436; Wixon, 2003; Gulliksen et al., 2006; Caple, 2010). In the field of ergonomics numerous case studies have been performed on the integration of workplace ergonomics in product development (e.g., Broberg, 1997; Neumann et al., 2009), but as of yet the integration of product ergonomics in product development has received less attention.The goal of this study is to contribute to the understanding of how usability is dealt with in product development practice. It has a descriptive as well as a normative component (cf. Moenaert et al., 2010): to obtain insight into how product development groups in large-scale multinationals deal with usability in the current practice of product development. The second – normative – aim of the study is to assess what factors in product development influence the usability of products either positively or negatively.Below a review of literature on three subjects is provided: 1) the concept of usability and its relation to ergonomics is discussed, 2) key methods for creating usable products and 3) existing studies of usability in product development practice.Since 2000 the International Ergonomics Associate defines ergonomics as follows (IEA, 2014):“Ergonomics is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of the interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the profession that applies theoretical principles, data and methods to design in order to optimize human well being and overall system performance.”Within ergonomics there are domains of specialisation, focussing on the different aspects of the fit between people and products/systems, namely physical ergonomics, cognitive ergonomics and organizational ergonomics.Ergonomics as a discipline and profession are about developing products and systems that fit well with people's needs and capabilities. The goal and definition of ergonomics seem to be comparable to User- or Human-Centred Design (HCD/UCD) (ISO, 2010), which is described by Vreedenburg et al. (2002a) as follows:“In user-centred design solutions that fit the user should be taken as a starting point and product quality should be measured from a user point of view, taking into account needs, wishes, characteristics and abilities of the projected user group.”Usability is a, related but complementary, concept that defines the quality of the interaction between people and systems. If ergonomics and human-centred design are the means to create products that fit people, usability is how we measure the fit.The concept of usability originated from the field of human–computer interaction where it was applied to ‘visual display terminals’ (Shackel, 1984). Many perspectives on and definitions of usability have been developed over the years (Hertzum, 2010), but the ISO 9241-11 Standard (ISO, 1998, p.2) contains what is considered the most widely accepted definition of usability (Jordan, 1998; Jokela et al., 2003):“Usability is the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.”Though the construct of usability emerged from the field of Human–Computer Interaction, it does not solely apply to cognitive and sensorial usage issues. The concept of usability helps to define and operationalize the quality of the interaction and experience, and can be applied to physical or digital products alike. In addition, the definition of the satisfaction component of usability includes ‘freedom from discomfort’, which also includes physical interactions.The ISO-definition of usability contains two user performance measurements (effectiveness and efficiency) and one user experience measurement (user satisfaction). This aligns with the definition of ergonomics by the IEA in which the goals of the profession are described as optimizing human well-being and system performance.Over time a large number of theories and methods have been developed that provide product developers with guidance on user involvement - collecting information about users and their environments (Lauesen, 1997) - in the different phases of product development (Nielsen and Mack, 1994; Kanis, 1998; Stanton and Young, 1998; Bevan, 2003). Two of the most prominent methodologies for creating usable products are Usability Engineering (Nielsen, 1992) and User-Centred Design (UCD) (ISO, 1999; Vredenburg et al., 2002a). Guiding principles in both approaches are taking the user into account in all phases of product development, testing early and often, and performing iterative design cycles.Though there is a considerable number of reports on the practice of ergonomics or usability in product development (e.g., Wiklund, 1994; Jordan et al., 1996; Lauesen, 1997; Väänänen-Vainio-Mattila and Ruuska, 2000; Bouwmeester and Stompff, 2006; Lee and Pan, 2007; Hendrick, 2008), a large part of this consists of descriptions of usability departments and development projects by usability specialists or designers employed by the company being described, and mostly studies are not anonymized. These are factors that may have lead to somewhat less critical descriptions in most insider accounts of human/user-centred design practice (Lindholm et al., 2003: p.vii; Steen, 2008: p.56). Finally, these accounts often do not report methods for data collection and interpretation, and thus it is hard to make an assessment of their trustworthiness (Graneheim and Lundman, 2004; Shenton, 2004).There are also studies of usability in product development practice conducted by (external) researchers. In these cases data collection methods are usually questionnaires (Rauch and Wilson, 1995; Vredenburg et al., 2002b; Venturi and Troost, 2004; Ji and Yun, 2006), interviews (Bekker, 1995; Borgholm and Madsen, 1999; Boivie et al., 2003, 2006; Bruno and Dick, 2007), or a combination of both (Rosenbaum et al., 2000; Gulliksen et al., 2006; Neumann et al., 2009). Informants are mostly usability specialists and interaction designers, and the focus is usually not so much on the product development process and team as a whole, but on usability-related activities and usability departments. This despite the fact that several authors conclude that to achieve a high level of usability many disciplines must be involved (Rauch and Wilson, 1995; Gulliksen et al., 2006) and a multidisciplinary approach is one of the principles of user-centred design (ISO, 1999; Vredenburg et al., 2002a).A returning topic of interest in the studies of usability in practice is what methods for user-centred design are applied, why, and when (Bekker, 1995; Clegg et al., 1997; Helander, 1999; Rosenbaum et al., 2000; Vredenburg et al., 2002b; Boivie et al., 2003, 2006; Gulliksen et al., 2006; Ji and Yun, 2006; Bruno and Dick, 2007). And to what extent does the development process allow for user involvement and an iterative approach throughout the process (Clegg et al., 1997; Boivie et al., 2003, 2006; Gulliksen et al., 2006; Ji and Yun, 2006; Bruno and Dick, 2007; Neumann et al., 2009).Apart from these methodological issues, the studies reviewed point out factors related to team composition (when are usability specialists involved?) and development team collaboration (Clegg et al., 1997; Vredenburg et al., 2002b; Boivie et al., 2003; Venturi and Troost, 2004; Gulliksen et al., 2006; Neumann et al., 2009). Finally, the attitude towards usability within an organization is reported to be an important factor to influence whether a company can effectively conduct user-centred design (Bekker, 1995; Rauch and Wilson, 1995; Rosenbaum et al., 2000; Venturi and Troost, 2004; Boivie et al., 2006). Finally, for product development teams to function effectively, the development of shared understanding is critical (Kleinsmann and Valkenburg, 2008), especially when dealing with usability, which practitioners consider an ungraspable, fuzzy concept (Clegg et al., 1997; Gulliksen et al., 2006).
