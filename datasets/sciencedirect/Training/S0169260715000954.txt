@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Background and objectiveSeveral abnormal brain regions are known to be linked to depression, including amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) etc. The aim of this study is to apply EEG (electroencephalogram) data analysis to investigate, with respect to mild depression, whether there exists dysregulation in these brain regions.MethodsEEG sources were assessed from 9 healthy and 9 mildly depressed subjects who were classified according to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) criteria. t-Test was used to calculate the eye movement data and standardized low resolution tomography (sLORETA) was used to correlate EEG activity.ResultsA comparison of eye movement data between the healthy and mild depressed subjects exhibited that mildly depressed subjects spent more time viewing negative emotional faces. Comparison of the EEG from the two groups indicated higher theta activity in BA6 (Brodmann area) and higher alpha activity in BA38.ConclusionsEEG source location results suggested that temporal pole activity to be dysregulated, and eye-movement data analysis exhibited mild depressed subjects paid much more attention to negative face expressions, which is also in accordance with the results of EEG source location.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A World Mental Health Survey conducted in 17 countries found that on average about 1 in 20 people reported having an episode of depression sometime in their life [1], and it is estimated that depression will constitute the second largest burden of disease by the year 2020 [2]. A large amount of brain imaging research has been focused on the neural correlates of depression using experiments that monitor emotions [3–5]. The emotion-based studies found that some brain regions, such as amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), tends to generate abnormal activities in depression [6].The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have high spatial resolution, but suffer from relatively low temporal resolution. On the other hand, EEG (electroencephalogram) has higher temporal resolution, is inexpensive, and simple to use. EEG is therefore commonly used as an input to techniques that investigate brain activity. Meanwhile, research [7] proposed new method to help solve the inverse source imaging technologies. Another example is sLORETA which uses source EEG to compute images of neuronal activity. These images are then used to accurately identify the 3D distribution of the neuronal activity [8]. Other examples include work by Farahbod et al. that demonstrated a more pronounced lateralization effect in normal healthy controls than those of MDD (major depressive disorder) subjects when changing from a resting (eyes-closed) condition to viewing faces without emotional valence [9]. Ricardo-Garcell et al. reported that both hemispheres could be affected by MDD, but abnormal EEG sources can be found more frequently in the right side, with the maximal abnormal inverse solution at the alpha and theta bands in frontal and parietal cortices [10]. Other researches have also proved differences between mild depressed subjects and healthy controls in delta, theta, alpha and beta bands with EEG source location techniques [10–14].To our knowledge, current research has focused on the severely depressed, with mild depression receiving considerably less attention. Taking into account the previous research on major depression disorders (MDD), we suppose that, like MDD, mild depression subjects would also have a bias towards negative face expressions, but with the typical brain activity less pronounced. Hence, the aim of this study is to test this hypothesis by observing the abnormal brain regions of mildly depressed subjects during the viewing facial expression pictures.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In summary, our results suggest, depressed individuals may exhibit a bias toward negative stimuli, especially concerning face processing. From the source location result of sLORETA, the higher activity in BA6 of theta band indicates that mild depressed subjects paid much more attention to negative face expressions, and that the temporal pole has a dysregulation.In our future work, different levels of depression and emotion dysregulation will be related to structural and functional abnormalities of the brain regions. The doubt over sample size will also be removed by increasing the sample size of the depressed group. It is hoped that we may then generalize these findings to help the treatment of depression.The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.
