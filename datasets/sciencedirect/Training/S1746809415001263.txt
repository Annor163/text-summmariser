@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The multifocal visual evoked potential (mfVEP) test measures the potentials obtained by simultaneous stimulation of multiple areas of the visual field. The principal mfVEP signal characteristics analysed are intensity and latency. A new parameter named Percentage of Energy (PoE) based on energy distribution along the recording is defined to evaluate (mfVEP) response intensity. mfVEP signals from controls and subjects classified according to the risk of developed Multiple Scleroris (MS) are used: 24 control, 15 Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS), 28 Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) and 28 MS diagnosed. Eyes from CIS and MS groups have been classified in neuritis optic eyes (NO) and no affected by neuritis optics eyes (nON). mfVEP signals intensity are analysed using the classic signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and the PoE parameter. Index on discrimination between controls and different groups of diagnosed patients based on area under the curve are calculated using SNR and PoE. Lastly reproducibility test of SNR and PoE are analysed.The mean values of coefficient of variability (Cv) for all the subjects are CVSRN=0.34 and CVPOE=0.17 (p<0.05). Significance difference between diagnosed groups is found in eight cases if SNR is used to quantify intensity of mfVEP signals. However, if PoE parameter is used, significance difference is founded in 10 cases. The mean area under the curve between control and diagnosed patients is increased from AUCSNR=0.79 to AUCPOE=0.83 (p<0.05). Better concordance in the test–retest measurements is obtained by using the PoE parameter.In conclusion, the PoE parameter presents advantages over the SNR parameter when characterizing mfVEP signal amplitude.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Objective assessment of the visual pathway is usually carried out by recording and analysing neurophysiological signals. The most common technique is to perform the visual-evoked-potential (VEP) test, which measures the potentials obtained by stimulating the complete visual field using the flash or checkerboard visual stimuli. This technique produces an overall response, but it does not provide specific topographical information about the retina and visual cortex [1].The advantage of the multifocal visual-evoked-potential (mfVEP) test is that it allows practitioners to analyse the topographical features of different segments of the visual field represented in the primary visual cortex [2]. Improvements in various aspects of this technique (visual stimulation [3,4], electrode number and position [5,6], signal analysis and classification [7–9], etc.) have enhanced its clinical utility in diagnosis of diseases such as glaucoma, optic neuritis (ON), multiple sclerosis (MS) and other pathologies that affect the visual pathway.One of the acknowledged issues with mfVEP signals is their low amplitude (in the order of nV), which may even be essentially zero in some locations in control subjects due to local folding of the cortex [10]. Signal amplitude decreases in the presence of body fat, while muscle tension and alpha waves provide significant sources of interference [11]. For these reasons, it is common to find inter-subject and intra-subject differences in recordings, which restricts clinical use of mfVEP signals [12].One of the methods widely used when studying mfVEP signals is to define a signal window (SW) and a noise window (NW). The signal window is defined as the time interval in which the evoked response (mixed with noise) is present, while in the noise window no physiological response to visual stimulus is considered to exist. However, there is no consensus on where to set the boundaries of these two windows. Examples of windows boundaries used are: SW=45–150ms and NW=325–430ms [10]; SW=0–200ms and NW=300–500ms [13]; SW=50–150ms and NW=230–330ms [14]; and SW=37–260ms and NW=667–890ms [12].MfVEP signal amplitude may be useful for detecting neural degeneration in the visual pathway [15]. Some authors evaluate the mfVEP recordings’ response or intensity by measuring the maximal peak-to-trough amplitude in a predetermined interval: 60–180ms [16,17], 70–200ms [18], etc. In [19], the authors observe a reduction of the largest peak–trough difference within the 70–210ms interval in eyes with optic neuritis.Widely accepted way of quantifying mfVEP signals’ amplitude is to calculate the root mean square (RMS) of the traces taken over a particular time window [20]. The fact that the RMS value does not depend on waveform is an advantage when working with weak responses, but also means that a signal containing a high level of noise may generate RMS values similar to the RMS values of the desired signal.Another possibility is to use the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in each of the sectors of the visual field [4,21]. Here, the SNR values are converted into a z-score relative to a normal distribution derived from 100 control subjects [22,23]. The monocular response amplitude, defined as SNR, is used to analyse mfVEP signals in multiple sclerosis patients [24]. The type of analysis could be use to evaluate the advantages of using an mfVEP-signal prediction method on various points on the skull [25]; to compare various multifocal visual stimulation methods [4]; or to evaluate the effects of eccentricity on contrast response characteristics [21].The purpose of this study is to examine the advantages of using a new mfVEP signal amplitude or intensity measurement parameter—the percentage of energy (PoE). This parameter is obtained by calculating the percentage of energy in the signal window in relation to the trace's total energy. It is a relative measurement of the signal's characteristics, which means that in many cases it will be immune to noise (if the interference affects the signal and noise windows similarly, as has been stated in previous works [10]. In contrast, this parameter does not provide information about the wave's temporal characteristics.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper proposes a new parameter with which to quantify mfVEP signal intensity in patients with a relative risk of developing multiple sclerosis. It defines the PoE parameter as the percentage of energy, in relation to the complete trace, included in a selected time interval (signal window).The percentage of energy measurement is a natural approach to characterize bioelectrical signals. Previous works [36–38] have also implemented percentage or energy analysis in the frequency domain, a measurement termed relative wavelet energy (RWE). As the goal of this work was to quantify the energy in the recordings, PoE in the time domain was sufficient and was used because it is simpler and faster to determine than RWE.This paper's main conclusion is that the PoE parameter offers advantages over the SNR parameter when characterizing mfVEP signals. SNR and PoE values are not directly comparable (Table 2), but CV statistical significance different values demonstrated that PoE variability is less than SNR variability.Using SNR or PoE it is easy to check that diagnosed patients present an important reduction of amplitude according to the developed sclerosis multiple due to axonal degeneration. This finding is in line with previous studies where it was stated [39,40].Our results indicated that the PoE parameter obtains a better discrimination between eyes of different disease (Tables 3 and 4). Using the PoE parameter, there was significant difference in 10 cases, however only 8 cases present significant difference using SNR parameter. Significant difference was reported previously between Control and MS ON eyes [24,41] and between Control and MS no ON eyes [24]. As in previous works [42] no significant difference was found between MS-on y MS-nON due to it could be stated that MS-nON are subclinically affected.To the best of our knowledge, just one work [33] had compared results from patients with different risk of developing MS. In this study, the authors include two different CIS categories (CIS-Low Risk and CIS High Risk, defined in [46] and do not include RIS patients. Our results with PoE were improved compared to those of the previous study because we found a significant difference between RIS and control, but in the equivalent comparison in that study (Control versus CIS LR), a significant difference was not found.To study the capacity to distinguish between diagnosed groups using amplitude parameters AUC values have been used. PoE values improves SNR values (AUCPoE=0.83 vs. AUCSNR=0.79) and present significant differences. Previous studies obtains AUC values between Control vs. MS_On of AUC=0.91 [24] and AUC=0.86 [43] (using cluster criterion for amplitude).Inter-session variability could be an issue in longitudinal evaluation of disease progression and/or response to treatment [44]. Although both parameters (SNR and PoE) obtain highly reproducibility values, our findings indicate that the correlation coefficient is greater (rPoE>rSNR), that test–retest concordance is slightly higher, and that the confidence interval is narrower (95%) when using the percentage of energy: CCCPoE=0.9502(CI 95%: 0.8272–0.9863), CCCSNR=0.9449 (CI 95%: 0.7845–0.9868). According to McBride criterion [45], the CCC improves from moderate to substantial. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that using PoE improved inter-session agreement when healthy subjects were tested on different days.However, our study has some limitations. On the one hand, the number of subjects used in the experiments was low. For example, when studying CCC it is desirable to perform the assessment on at least 25 samples [45].Nevertheless, we believe that if these results are validated in a later study conducted on a higher number of patients, adoption of the PoE parameter could increase clinical use of mfVEP in diagnosing and monitoring visual pathway pathologies in patients with demyelinating and ischaemic diseases.The authors claim no conflicts of interest.
