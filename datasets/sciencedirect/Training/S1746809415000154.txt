@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aim of this study is to analyze different sources of noise in ECG recordings from stress tests in order to obtain reliable parameters and measurements for the analysis of T-wave and QRS-complex alternans (TWA & QRSA). Simple methods for eliminating common sources of noise like power-line interference, baseline drift and electromyographic noise were used. The pre-processing phase considered the detection of steep slope/spike, low amplitude signal, and flat line or missing lead artefacts. The detection of TWA and QRSA was based on Principal Component Analysis indices and wave amplitudes considering all the leads.A particular database of 106 ECG records during stress testing was considered. The signal quality analysis performed in this study has permitted to obtain reliable and noise-tolerant measurements of TWA and QRSA indices. The different diagnostic groups were used for the evaluation of the clinical significance of the alternans. Men have significantly higher values of QRSA than women. Smokers have significantly higher TWA values as compared with non-smokers. Significant negative correlation was obtained between age and both TWA and QRSA. Correlations between TWA and QRSA and the double product of arterial hypertension and the maximal heart rate during the stress test were statistically significant, positive and relatively strong.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Microvolt T-wave and QRS-complex alternans (TWA & QRSA) are an electrophysiological phenomenon associated with the change in the shape of the QRS or T-wave, which appears in alternation on an every other beat basis, and which are not apparent to the naked eye. Microvolt TWA has the ability to identify patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death [16,19]. In studies on animals [30] and humans [27], TWA is strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiac electrical instability and re-entrant ventricular tachyarrhythmia.QRSA is a phenomenon seen in different clinical situations â€“ mainly supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias [25,26]. However, there is no agreement in the clinical significance of QRSA. There are conflicting evidences of the connection with the risk of sudden cardiac death in selected patients [12,26]. A recent study has shown that QRSA is increased in patients with positive stress ECG test and in patients with angiographically significant coronary artery disease (AS_CAD) [6].Originally, it was proposed that the electrophysiological basis for TWA is alternating conduction pathways on a beat by beat basis arising from spatial dispersion of refractoriness [31]. However, this alternating conduction hypothesis predicts that TWA would be associated with equal or greater QRSA, which is inconsistent with clinical observations. A compelling body of evidence nowadays suggests that TWA emanates from beat-to-beat alternation of membrane repolarization (i.e. action potential duration) at the level of the cardiac myocyte [11].TWA is a heart rate-dependent measure of repolarization [18] and is not generally present at rest even in patients at risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Therefore exercise stress, pharmacologic stress, or atrial pacing must be utilized in order to elevate the heart rate. The exercise stress test is performed by a veloergometer or a treadmill, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded during the test may contain different sources of noise. The body of the patient, the ECG cables and electrodes are moving, and along with the noise that accompanies the resting ECG as: mains interference, baseline wander (drift), and electromyographic noise; the stress ECG may contain: missing or saturated lead, abnormal low amplitude signal, steep-slope noise, etc. Practically without a reasonable removal or suppression of the noise and signal quality analysis of the ECGs, the TWA and QRSA detection would not be reliable.The main aim of the study is to analyze different sources of noise in ECG signals recorded in difficult conditions of acquisition, such as stress test, in order to obtain reliable parameters and measurements for the analysis of T-wave and QRS-complex alternans. The pre-processing phase considers the filtering of power-line interference, baseline drift and electromyographic noise, as well as the detection of steep slope/spike, low amplitude signal, and flat line/missing lead artefacts. Then, a description of the particular method developed for the detection and quantification of T wave and QRS alternans based on Principal Component Analysis and the combined-lead amplitude follows. Evaluation of the clinical significance of the alternans in different diagnostic groups is performed, and the results are analyzed and discussed.
