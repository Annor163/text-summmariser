@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Based on clonal selection mechanism in immune system, a dynamic local search based immune automatic clustering algorithm (DLSIAC) is proposed to automatically evolve the number of clusters as well as a proper partition of datasets. The real based antibody encoding consists of the activation thresholds and the clustering centers. Then based on the special structures of chromosomes, a particular dynamic local search scheme is proposed to exploit the neighborhood of each antibody as much as possible so to realize automatic variation of the antibody length during evolution. The dynamic local search scheme includes four basic operations, namely, the external cluster swapping, the internal cluster swapping, the cluster addition and the cluster decrease. Moreover, a neighborhood structure based clonal mutation is adopted to further improve the performance of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been extensively compared with five state-of-the-art automatic clustering techniques over a suit of datasets. Experimental results indicate that the DLSIAC is superior to other five clustering algorithms on the optimum number of clusters found and the clustering accuracy. In addition, DLSIAC is applied to a real problem, namely image segmentation, with a good performance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Data clustering is the process of dividing n data points into k subgroups in d dimensional feature space. Data points are similar in the same group and dissimilar in different groups. In past few decades, clustering algorithms are used in many applications, such as machine learning [1], compression [2], image segmentation [3,4], data mining [5,6], pattern recognition [7,8], etc. Most of the clustering algorithms can broadly be classified into hierarchical and partitional clustering. In the hierarchical clustering algorithms [9], the output is “a tree showing a sequence of clustering with each clustering being a partition of the dataset” [10]. The partitional clustering algorithms [11] attempt to partition the dataset directly into a specified number of clusters by optimizing certain criteria and thus they can be regarded as optimization problems. This paper will focus on the partitional techniques.The partitional clustering algorithms can be performed in two different ways: crisp and fuzzy. In crisp clustering, the clusters are disjoint and non-overlapping in nature. Any pattern may belong to one and only one class in this case. In fuzzy clustering, a pattern may belong to all the classes with a certain fuzzy membership grade [12]. Fuzzy C-means (FCM) [13] is a well-known clustering technique and it uses the principles of fuzzy sets to evolve a partition U(X). The fuzzy encoding-decoding scheme [14] is used to deal with the relationships between the number of clusters versus the reconstruction properties and the resulting reconstruction error. Assuming that fuzzy sets (relations) are the result of fuzzy clustering and of the FCM, it is obvious that the schemes of encoding and decoding relates to the way in which fuzzy clustering is completed. Hence, we can compare the performance of fuzzy clustering using a reconstruction criterion proposed in [14]. However, most of the partitional clustering approaches like FCM are based on a given objective function and assume that the number of clusters is known a priori. Further, these approaches apply the alternating optimization techniques to obtain the final clustering results so that iterative nature makes them sensitive to initialization and susceptible to local optima. Moreover, the actual number of clusters is unavailable in many applications, and the optimal number of clusters cannot be easily and intuitively estimated beforehand. Therefore, how to find the optimal number of clusters of datasets is always a challenging task.In this paper, a novel immune-inspired approach called dynamic local search based immune automatic clustering (DLSIAC) is proposed for the automatic fuzzy clustering. Two techniques are used to improve performance of the proposed DLSIAC. Firstly, to find the correct number of clusters at a fast speed, a dynamic local search strategy, which performs on the clustering centers is employed. According to the special structure of chromosomes, four kinds of local search operators including the external cluster swapping, the internal cluster swapping, the cluster additional and the cluster decrease are used with the same probability to search for the number of clusters automatically. Moreover, a modified clonal mutation scheme is introduced to improve the clustering accuracy and convergence rate further, in which two mutation strategies are selected adaptively to generate new antibodies. The proposed algorithm is extensively compared with five state-of-the-art automatic clustering algorithms including the real-coded variable string length genetic algorithm based fuzzy clustering technique (FVGA) [15], the dynamic clustering approach based on particle swarm optimization (DCPSO) [16], the automatic clustering by using improved differential evolution algorithm (ACDE) [17], the automatic fuzzy clustering using modified differential evolution (MODEAFC) [18] and a two-stage genetic algorithm for automatic clustering (TGCA) [19] in terms of the clustering accuracy, the optimal number of clusters, the reconstruction error [14], Minkowski Score (MS) [20], etc. In addition, DLSIAC is applied to image segmentation with a good performance.The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 represents related works. The proposed algorithm is described in details in Section 3. Section 4 and Section 5 present and discuss the experimental results of clustering over thirty datasets and an application in the image segmentation. Finally, we outline the conclusions of this paper and briefly discuss future work in Section 6.
