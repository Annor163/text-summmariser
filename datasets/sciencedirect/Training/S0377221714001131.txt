@&#ABSTRACT@&#
New theoretical foundations for analyzing the newsboy problem under incomplete information about the probability distribution of random demand are presented. Firstly, we reveal that the distribution-free newsboy problem under the worst-case and best-case demand scenarios actually reduces to the standard newsboy problem with demand distributions that bound the allowable distributions in the sense of increasing concave order. Secondly, we provide a theoretical tool for seeking the best-case and worst-case order quantities when merely the support and the first k moments of the demand are known. Using this tool we derive closed form formulas for such quantities in the case of known support, mean and variance, i.e. k=2. Consequently, we generalize all results presented so far in literature for the worst-case and best-case scenarios, and present some new ones. Extensions of our findings to the cases of the known mode of a unimodal demand distribution, the known median, and to other stochastic inventory problems are indicated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since the pioneer works of Arrow, Harris, and Marshak (1951) and Morse and Kimball (1951), the classic single-period, single-item inventory problem with random demand, commonly referred to as the newsboy or newsvendor problem, has attracted a great deal of attention and played a central role at the conceptual foundations of stochastic inventory theory; Porteus (2002, chap. 1). Typically, it is formulated as follows. Each day the proverbial newsboy has to decide how many newspapers to stock before observing demand. He purchases them from a publisher at a unit cost c, and sells them at a price p to customers whose uncertain demand is described by a random variable X. Any unsold items are recycled with a unit salvage value s; it is assumed that p>c>s. The newsboy problem is to find the order (purchase) quantity that maximizes the expected profit, and this quantity is known to be the smallest q such thatF(q)⩾p-cp-s, where F is the cumulative distribution function of X. Numerous extensions of the newsboy problem were reviewed in Khouja (1999) and Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, and Seref (2011). Note here that we adopt a classic approach by assuming that the decision-maker is risk-neutral. The models in which he/she is risk-averse, risk-seeking, or uses a maximum entropy approach can be found in Wang, Webster, and Suresh (2009), Du Andersson, Jörnsten, Nonås, Sandal, and Ubøe (2012), Wu, Zhu, and Teunter (2013), and Wu et al. (2013).Scarf (1958) was the first who addressed the distribution-free newsboy problem. He assumed that merely the mean μ=E(X) and the variance σ2=Var(X) are known, and derived a closed form formula for the order quantity that maximizes the minimum expected profit over all demand distributions with given μ and σ2. For this reason, this worst-case order quantity is also referred to as being found under the maximin criterion. Gallego and Moon (1993) disseminated the rather unnoticed result of Scarf, modified it by restricting the demand distribution to non-negative values, provided a simpler proof with economic interpretations, and showed some applications to other stochastic inventory problems. Alfares and Elmorra (2005) extended the modified Scarf formula to the case of shortage penalty.Gallego, Ryan, and Simchi-Levy (2001) assumed that X is a discrete random variable taking a finite number of given values. When selected moments and percentiles of X are known, they showed that the worst-case order quantity can be found by solving a linear program. They also demonstrated that if the demand distribution is characterized by μ and σ2 then the maximin policy mostly performs quite well, relative to a policy based on the normally distributed demand. Similar results concerning the performance of the modified Scarf formula were earlier reported by Gallego and Moon (1993). Perakis and Roels (2008) and Andersson et al. (2013) observed, however, that in some situations the maximin policy may lead to an expected profit much lower than the optimal one.The order quantity found under the worst-case demand scenario is pessimistic (conservative). A less pessimistic policy based on minimizing the expected maximum regret was proposed as an alternative; see e.g. Yue, Chen, and Wang (2006), Perakis and Roels (2008). Yue et al. (2006) found the corresponding closed form formula for the minimax regret order quantity under the Scarf assumption that μ and σ are known without imposing the non-negativity constraint on the demand distribution. Perakis and Roels (2008) extended their result by adding this obvious constraint, and also solved some cases involving the known median and mode, the symmetricity and unimodality of the demand distribution. Another alternative to the maximin policy was proposed in Andersson et al. (2013). Assuming only the knowledge of μ and σ, the authors demonstrated empirically that finding the most likely distribution in the sense of the maximum entropy leads on average to better results.To the best of our knowledge, the maximax criterion, which maximizes the expected profit under the best-case demand scenario, has been much less examined. Only trivial cases, resulting from Jensen’s inequality, of the best-case order quantities have been mentioned in Gallego and Moon (1993) and Yue et al. (2006). This observation also refers to other distribution-free stochastic inventory problems discussed in literature; see e.g. Godfrey and Powell (2001), Wu, Li, and Tsai (2002), Lin and Chu (2006), Ho (2009), and Kwon and Cheong (2014).In this paper we present new theoretical foundations for analyzing the distribution-free newsboy problem under the best-case and worst-case scenarios. Firstly, by using a simple expression for the expected profit, we reveal that this problem actually reduces to the standard newsboy problem with demand distributions that bound the allowable distributions in the sense of increasing concave order. Secondly, we provide a theoretical tool for seeking the best-case and worst-case order quantities when merely the support and the first k moments of the demand are known. Using this tool we derive closed form formulas for such quantities in the case of known support [a,b], mean μ, and variance σ2, i.e. k=2. Consequently, we generalize all results presented so far in literature for the worst-case and best-case scenarios, and present some new ones. Theoretical tools are also provided for examining the problem when the median, or the mode of the unimodal distribution are additionally available.The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we formulate the problem under study and show its main theoretical result. Section 3 includes a theoretical tool for seeking the sharp lower and upper bounds on the expected met demand needed for deriving the worst-case and the best-case order quantities. Using this tool we find, in particular, closed form formulas for such bounds in the case of known support, mean, and variance. The resulting worst-case and best-case order quantities are presented in Section 4. Section 5 illustrates our findings by the use of a numerical example taken from literature. In Section 6 we present some extensions of our results, while final remarks are made in Section 7.In the classic newsboy problem, no cost is assumed if the order quantity does not meet the demand. Although this cost might be difficult to define in practice, we adopt a more general model considered by Alfares and Elmorra (2005) and Perakis and Roels (2008), in which a known unit lost sales (shortage) cost of ℓ is assumed. Therefore, if q is an order quantity and X denotes the random demand, min(X,q) represents the demand that is met, X−min(X,q) the demand that is unmet, and q−min(X,q) is the salvage amount. Thus, min(X,q) units will be sold at a price p, q−min(X,q) units at s, and the ordering and lost sales costs will be cq and ℓ[X−min(X,q)], respectively. Consequently, the expected profit is expressed byπ(q)=pE[min(X,q)]+sE[q-min(X,q)]-cq-ℓ{μ-E[min(X,q)]}=(p+ℓ-s)∫-∞∞min(x,q)dF(x)-(c-s)q-ℓμ,where μ=E[X] and F is the cumulative distribution function of X, for short called later the distribution, that is, F(x)=P(X⩽x).Since for every distribution F (defined as a right-continuous function) with a finite meand+dq∫-∞∞min(x,q)dF(x)=d+dqq-∫-∞qF(x)dx=1-F(q),the first right derivative of π(q) isd+dq[π(q)]=(p+ℓ-c)-(p+ℓ-s)F(q), and the optimal order quantity q∗ can be defined as the smallest q such that F(q)⩾r, wherer=p+ℓ-cp+ℓ-s. In particular, if X is a continuous random variable, q∗=F−1(r). Note here that the inclusion of the expected lost sales cost ℓ{μ−E[min(X,q)]} can make the maximum expected profit π(q∗) negative. Assuming then q∗=0 does not help because π (0)=−ℓμ for a non-negative X.We would like to emphasize here that the expected profit π(q) has been mostly presented by using more complex (but equivalent) expressions. For example, in Alfares and Elmorra (2005) and Perakis and Roels (2008) this profit is shown asπ(q)=pE[min(X,q)]+sE[max(q-X,0)]]-ℓE[max(X-q,0)]-cq.Suppose only a partial information about the distribution F of X is available in the sense thatF∈F, whereFis a certain family of distributions with a finite mean. For every q, let L(q) and U(q) be lower and upper bounds on the expected met demand E[min(X,q)], that is,L(q)⩽minF∈F∫-∞∞min(x,q)dF(x)⩽maxF∈F∫-∞∞min(x,q)dF(x)⩽U(q).The bounds L(q) and U(q) are sharp, if there exist distributionsF̲q,F‾q∈Fsuch thatL(q)=∫-∞∞min(x,q)dF̲q(x)=minF∈F∫-∞∞min(x,q)dF(x),U(q)=∫-∞∞min(x,q)dF‾q(x)=maxF∈F∫-∞∞min(x,q)dF(x).The sharp bounds L(q) and U(q) lead to the following sharp lower and upper bounds on the expected profit π(q):π̲(q)=(p+ℓ-s)L(q)-(c-s)q-ℓμ,π¯(q)=(p+ℓ-s)U(q)-(c-s)q-ℓμ.Whenπ(q) andπ¯(q)are maximized over q, one defines the worst-case and best-case order quantities denoted byq∗ andq¯∗, respectively. Consequently, for any distributionF∈F, the corresponding optimal order quantity q∗ satisfiesπ̲(q̲∗)⩽π(q∗)⩽π¯(q¯∗). It does not mean, however, thatq̲∗⩽q∗⩽q¯∗, and one can get, for example,q¯∗<q̲∗<q∗.Recall that F is said to be smaller than G in the sense of increasing concave order, written F≼icvG, if for every non-decreasing and concave function φ(x),∫-∞∞φ(x)dF(x)⩽∫-∞∞φ(x)dG(x)provided that these integrals are finite; see e.g. Müller and Stoyan (2002, chap. 1) and Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007, chap. 4). Furthermore, if F and G have finite means then F≼icvG if, and only if,∫-∞∞min(x,q)dF(x)⩽∫-∞∞min(x,q)dG(x)for all q.LetFbe a certain family of distributions with the same finite mean. A distributionF̲(F‾)is called the infimum (supremum) ofFwith respect to ≼icvifF̲(F‾)is the greatest (smallest) distribution with respect to ≼icvsuch thatF≼icvF (F≼icvF‾) for allF∈F; see e.g. Müller and Stoyan (2002, chap. 1). AlthoughFandF‾bound the familyFin the sense of ≼icv, in general they do not have to belong toF, and hence they are called the infimum and the supremum rather than the minimum and the maximum. Note also thatFdoes have its infimum and supremum because the set of all distributions with the same finite mean, endowed with the partial order ≼icv, is a complete lattice; see Theorem 1.10.3 in Müller and Stoyan (2002, chap. 1).The following general theorem is a main theoretical result of this paper.Theorem 1Let the distribution of demand X belong to a certain familyFof distributions with a finite mean, for which there exist the sharp lower and upper bounds, L(q) and U(q), on E[min(X,q)]. Then the worst-case (best-case) order quantityq̲∗(q¯∗)can be defined as the smallest q such thatF(q)⩾r (F‾(q)⩾r), whereF̲(q)=1-d+L(q)dqF‾(q)=1-d+U(q)dqis the infimum (supremum) ofF, andr=p+ℓ-cp+ℓ-s.The proof is given in Appendix.The theorem states that the distribution-free newsboy problem under the maximin (maximax) criterion reduces to the standard newsboy problem with the demand distribution being the infimumF(the supremumF‾). Moreover, to determineFandF‾, and consequently the order quantitiesq∗ andq¯∗, it suffices to identify sharp lower and upper bounds, L(q) and U(q), on the expected met demand E[min(X,q)]. Theoretical tools for seeking such bounds are presented in Sections 3 and 5.The quantitiesq∗ andq¯∗can be regarded as extreme. To define a less extreme solution, one can follow the Hurwicz criterion and for a given coefficient of optimism α (0⩽α⩽1) define the order quantity qHthat maximizes the weighted expected profit:πH(q)=(1-α)π̲(q)+απ¯(q)=(p+ℓ-s)[(1-α)L(q)+αU(q)]-(c-s)q-ℓμ.Theorem 1 can be then reformulated to state that qHis the smallest q such that FH(q)⩾r, whereFH=(1-α)F̲+αF‾. Obviously, qHreduces toq∗ when α=0, and toq¯∗when α=1.In the previous section we showed that to find the order quantities under the maximin and maximax criteria it suffices to identify sharp lower and upper bounds, L(q) and U(q), on the expected met demand E[min(X,q)]. When only the support and the first k moments of X are assumed to be known, such bounds can be sought by using very general Theorem 2.1 in the monograph of Karlin and Studden (1966, chap. XII). To avoid the use of quite advanced mathematics, below we present a restricted to the function min(x,q) simpler version of this theorem that is sufficient for achieving the purpose of this paper. It can be regarded as a theoretical tool for seeking L(q) and U(q). The term “non-boundary conditions” should be made clear from Corollaries 1 and 2 that follow the theorem. Recall that for any random variable X its zero moment is 1, that is, μ0=E[X0]=1.Theorem 2Let X be a random variable on the interval [a,b] with known moments μi=E[Xi] (i=0,1,2,…,k) that satisfy the non-boundary conditions. Then for every q∈[a,b], the sharp lower and upper bounds, L(q) and U(q), on E[min(X,q)] can be defined as follows:L(q)=maxci∑i=0kμicisubject to∑i=0kcixi⩽min(x,q)forx∈[a,b];U(q)=minci∑i=0kμicisubject to∑i=0kcixi⩾min(x,q)forx∈[a,b].Thus, to find L(q) (U(q)) there is a need for identifying the coefficients c0,c1,…,ckof the polynomial P(x)=c0+c1x+⋯+ckxkthat maximize (minimize) c0+μ1c1+⋯+μkckunder the condition P(x)⩽(⩾)min(x,q) for every x∈[a,b]. Obviously, L(q)=U(q)=q for q⩽a, and L(q)=U(q)=μ1 for q⩾b.Let δxdenote the one-point (degenerate) distribution with mass in x. The following result, where the first moment is merely known (k=1), is attributed to folklore; it is presented here to make the paper more complete.Corollary 1Let the distribution of X belong to the familyFof distributions on [a,b] with mean μ that satisfies a<μ<b. Then for q∈[a,b], the sharp lower and upper bounds on E[min(X,q)] areL(q)=(b-μ)a+(μ-a)qb-aand U(q)=min(μ,q). Consequently, the minimum and maximum ofFareF̲=b-μb-aδa+μ-ab-aδbandF‾=δμ.Note here that the trivial upper bound U(q)=min(μ,q) is also justified by Jensen’s inequality. The two-point minimum distributionFhas mean μ and variance (μ−a) (b−μ). Therefore, for any distribution F on [a,b] with mean μ, its variance σ2 must satisfy σ2⩽(μ−a) (b−μ); see e.g. Bhatia and Davis (2000). This explains the non-boundary conditions stated in the following.Corollary 2Let the distribution of X belong to the familyFof distributions on [a,b] with mean μ and variance σ2that satisfy a<μ<b and 0<σ2<(μ−a) (b−μ). Then the sharp lower and upper bounds on E[min(X,q)] are:L(q)=q-(q-a)σ2(μ-a)2+σ2forq∈a,μ-(μ-a)2-σ22(μ-a),q+μ-(q-μ)2+σ22forq∈μ-(μ-a)2-σ22(μ-a),μ+(b-μ)2-σ22(b-μ),μ-(b-q)σ2(b-μ)2+σ2forq∈μ+(b-μ)2-σ22(b-μ),b;U(q)=qforq∈[a,μ-σ2b-μ],(μ-a)q+(b-μ)μ-σ2b-aforq∈μ-σ2b-μ,μ+σ2μ-a,μforq∈μ+σ2μ-a,b.Consequently, the infimum and supremum ofFare:F̲(q)=σ2(μ-a)2+σ2forq∈a,μ-(μ-a)2-σ22(μ-a),12+q-μ2(q-μ)2+σ2forq∈μ-(μ-a)2-σ22(μ-a),μ+(b-μ)2-σ22(b-μ),(b-μ)2(b-μ)2+σ2forq∈μ+(b-μ)2-σ22(b-μ),b,andF‾=b-μb-aδμ-σ2b-μ+μ-ab-aδμ+σ2μ-a.The proof is given in Appendix.The additional knowledge of σ2 assumed in Corollary 2 makes the bounds L(q) and U(q) tighter than those in Corollary 1. For the case [a,b]=[0,1], an equivalent result can be found in Kamburowski (1989) within the context of PERT; we want to note here that distribution F″ reported there (similarly asFpresented above) is not a five-point distribution as it is stated on page 58 in the monograph of Müller and Stoyan (2002, chap. 1). Clearly, the infimumFhas a continuous part onμ-(μ-a)2-σ22(μ-a),μ+(b-μ)2-σ22(b-μ), and it has discontinuitiesσ2(μ-a)2+σ2andσ2(b-μ)2+σ2at a and b, respectively. It is also interesting to observe that bothFandF‾have mean μ, but their variances satisfy:∫ab(q-μ)2dF̲(q)=σ2+σ22ln(μ-a)(b-μ)σ2>σ2>σ4(μ-a)(b-μ)=∫ab(q-μ)2dF‾(q).Thus, althoughFandF‾bound the familyFin the sense of increasing concave order, they do not belong to this family.It is interesting to consider the case when the support [a,b] is unknown. Since the demand cannot be negative, by letting a=0 and b→∞ in Corollary 2, one obtains the next result. Note here that for the support (−∞,∞), the infimumF̲(q)=12+q-μ2(q-μ)2+σ2listed below is given in Theorem 1.10.7 in Müller and Stoyan (2002, chap. 1).Corollary 3Let the distribution of X belong to the familyFof distributions on [0,∞) with mean μ and variance σ2>0. Then the sharp lower and upper bounds on E[min(X,q)] are:L(q)=qμ2μ2+σ2forq∈0,μ2+σ22μ,q+μ-(q-μ)2+σ22forq⩾μ2+σ22μ,and U(q)=min(μ,q). Consequently, the infimum and supremum ofFare:F̲(q)=σ2μ2+σ2forq∈0,μ2+σ22μ,12+q-μ2(q-μ)2+σ2forq⩾μ2+σ22μ,andF‾=δμ.As we demonstrated in this section, Theorem 2 appears to be useful in identifying sharp bounds on E[min(X,q)] when the support [a,b], mean μ, and variance σ2 of X are known. We examined then some quadratic functions, that is, polynomials of order k=2. When higher moments of X are also known, the problem becomes much more complex. For example, if the third moment E[X3] is additionally available, there is a need for solving parametric cubic equations, in which q is a parameter.The distributionsFandF‾presented in Corollaries 1–3 allow us to determine closed form formulas for the corresponding worst-case and best-case order quantitiesq∗ andq¯∗. Clearly, using Theorem 1,q∗ (q¯∗) can be defined as the smallest q such thatF(q)⩾r(F‾(q)⩾r), wherer=p+ℓ-cp+ℓ-s. The corresponding sharp bounds on the maximum expected profits areπ(q∗)=(p+ℓ−s)L(q∗)−(c−s)q∗−ℓμ andπ¯(q¯∗)=(p+ℓ-s)U(q¯∗)-(c-s)q¯∗-ℓμ.The order quantityq¯∗presented below is trivial. To the best of our knowledge, the quantityq∗ has never been examined. These quantities follow from Corollary 1.Corollary 4Let demand X have a distribution on [a,b] with mean μ that satisfies a<μ<b. Thenq¯∗=μwithπ¯(q¯∗)=(p-c)μ;q̲∗=aifr⩽b-μb-a,bifr>b-μb-a,and the two corresponding lower boundsπ(q∗) are (p+ℓ−c)a−ℓμ and (p−s)μ−(c−s)b, respectively.The next result follows from Corollary 2.Corollary 5Let demand X have a distribution on [a,b] with mean μ and variance σ2that satisfy a<μ<b and 0<σ2<(μ−a) (b−μ). Thenq̲∗=aifr⩽σ2(μ-a)2+σ2,μ+(p+ℓ+s-2c)σ2(p+ℓ-c)(c-s)ifσ2(μ-a)2+σ2<r⩽(b-μ)2(b-μ)2+σ2,bifr>(b-μ)2(b-μ)2+σ2,and the three corresponding lower boundsπ(q∗) are (p+ℓ−c)a−ℓμ,(p-c)μ-σ(p+ℓ-c)(c-s), and (p−s)μ−(c−s)b, respectively;q¯∗=μ-σ2b-μifr⩽b-μb-a,μ+σ2μ-aifr>b-μb-a,and the two corresponding upper boundsπ¯(q¯∗)are(p-c)μ-(p+ℓ-c)σ2b-μand(p-c)μ-(c-s)σ2μ-a, respectively.The order quantityq̲∗=μ+(p+ℓ+s-2c)σ2(p+ℓ-c)(c-s)was presented in Alfares and Elmorra (2005); it is an extension of the famous formula of Scarf (1958) for the case ℓ=0, and the support (−∞,∞). This quantity has been derived fromq∗=F−1(r), whereF̲(q)=12+q-μ2(q-μ)2+σ2is the second part in the definition of the infimum in Corollary 2.We normally expect demand to be at least a non-negative random variable. However, Alfares and Elmorra (2005) proposed thenq∗=0 wheneverπ̲μ+(p+ℓ+s-2c)σ2(p+ℓ-c)(c-s)⩽0, which is equivalent to(p-c)2(p-c)2+(p+ℓ-c)(c-s)⩽σ2μ2+σ2. The proper condition forq∗=0 isπ̲μ+(p+ℓ+s-2c)σ2(p+ℓ-c)(c-s)⩽π̲(0)=-ℓμbeing equivalent tor⩽σ2μ2+σ2. Clearly, the following result follows from Corollary 3. It can be also verified by letting a=0 and b→∞ in Corollary 5.Corollary 6Let demand X have a non-negative distribution with mean μ and variance σ2>0. Thenq¯∗=μwithπ¯(q¯∗)=(p-c)μ;q̲∗=0ifr⩽σ2μ2+σ2,μ+(p+ℓ+s-2c)σ2(p+ℓ-c)(c-s)otherwise,and the two corresponding lower boundsπ(q∗) are −ℓμ and(p-c)μ-σ(p+ℓ-c)(c-s), respectively.The extended worst-case order quantity of Scarf,q̲∗=μ+(p+ℓ+s-2c)σ2(p+ℓ-c)(c-s), appears in both Corollaries 5 and 6. One can presume that it is mostly valid whenever the ratior=p+ℓ-cp+ℓ-sis moderate, and only in extreme cases it must be replaced by either a or b (see Corollary 5), and by 0 (see Corollary 6). This will be illustrated in the next section.We reconsider the example from Silver and Peterson (1985), Gallego and Moon (1993), and Alfares and Elmorra (2005) by letting μ=900,σ=122, p=$50.30, c=$35.10, s=$25.00, and ℓ=$14.00. This yieldsr=p+ℓ-cp+ℓ-s=0.743. To specify the support [a,b] of X, which maintains the feasibility of μ=900 and σ=122 and allows the comparison ofq∗ andq¯∗with optimal order quantities q∗, we consider some simple cases.Case 1.Let the distribution F of X be uniform on [a,b] with mean μ=900 and standard deviation σ=122. Then μ=(a+b)/2 andσ=(b-a)/12implya=μ-3σ=688.69,b=μ+3σ=1111.31, andE[min(X,q)]=q-(q-a)22(b-a)for q∈[a,b]. The optimal order quantity is then q∗=F−1(r)=a+r(b−a)=1002.70, which yields the maximum expected profit π(q∗)=(p+ℓ−s)E[min(X,q∗)]−(c−s)q∗−ℓμ=$12094.26.When only the information about μ, σ, and [a,b] is available, we apply Corollary 5 to find the worst-case and the best-case order quantitiesq̲∗=μ+(p+ℓ+s-2c)σ2(p+ℓ-c)(c-s)=967.84andq¯∗=μ+σ2μ-a=970.44. The corresponding sharp lower and upper bounds on the maximum expected profit areπ̲(q̲∗)=(p-c)μ-σ(p+ℓ-c)(c-s)=$11584.87, andπ¯(q¯∗)=(p-c)μ-(c-s)σ2μ-a=$12968.59. Thus, the maximum relative percentage error in estimating the optimal expected profit isMRPE=π¯(q¯∗)-π̲(q̲∗)π̲(q̲∗)×100%=11.94%. Assuming the uniformly distributed demand X, the relative percentage error induced byq∗ isRPE(q̲∗)=π(q̲∗)-π(q∗)π(q∗)×100%=-0.47%, and the corresponding error forq¯∗isRPE(q¯∗)=-0.40%.If the distribution of X is triangular on [a,b] with mode m, thenμ=a+m+b3andσ2=a2+m2+b2-am-mb-ab18. We consider the following three subcases: m=μ, m=a, and m=b.Case 2.1.For the symmetric triangular distribution F on [a,b], we havea=μ-6σ=601.16,b=μ+6σ=1198.84,E[min(X,q)]=q-(q-a)33(μ-a)(b-a)for a⩽q⩽μ, andE[min(X,q)]=μ-(b-q)33(b-μ)(b-a)for μ⩽q⩽b. Also,q∗=F-1(r)=b-(b-μ)(b-a)(1-r)=984.59, which yields π(q∗)=$12104.34.For the triangular distribution F on [a,b] with m=a, we havea=μ-2σ=727.47,b=μ+22σ=1245.07, andE[min(X,q)]=μ-(b-q)33(b-a)2for q∈[a,b]. Thenq∗=F-1(r)=b-(b-a)1-r=982.67and π(q∗)=$11961.63.For the triangular distribution F on [a,b] with m=b, we havea=μ-22σ=554.93,b=μ+2σ=1072.53, andE[min(X,q)]=q-(q-a)33(b-a)2for q∈[a,b]. Thenq∗=F-1(r)=a+(b-a)r=1001.09, which yields π (q∗)=$12289.27.Suppose a random variable Y is normally distributed with μY=900 and σY=122. Then demand X defined as the conditional random variable X=Y∣0⩽Y<∞ has the truncated normal distribution on [0,∞). However, since μY−7σY>0, one can safely state that this truncated distribution F has μ≈900 and σ≈122. The optimal order quantity is q∗=F−1(0.743)=979.62, which yields the maximum expected profit π(q∗)=$12133.85.The remaining relevant results are presented in Table 1.Theorem 2 presented in Section 3 can be regarded as a theoretical tool for analyzing the problem when the distribution of demand X is characterized by its support and the first k moments. One can extend this tool by assuming that some additional information about this distribution is also available. As in the case of Theorem 2, the next two results can be deduced from Theorem 2.1 in Karlin and Studden (1966, chap. XII); their proofs are omitted.Theorem 3Let X have a distribution on [a,b] with known median m and moments μi=E[Xi] (i=0,1,2,…,k) that satisfy the non-boundary conditions. For every q∈[a,b], the sharp lower and upper bounds, L(q) and U(q), on E[min(X,q)] can be defined as follows:L(q)=maxd,cid/2+∑i=0kμicisubject tod1{x⩽m}+∑i=0kcixi⩽min(x,q)forx∈[a,b],U(q)=mind,cid/2+∑i=0kμicisubject tod1{x⩽m}+∑i=0kcixi⩾min(x,q)forx∈[a,b],where1{x⩽m}=1 for x⩽m, and1{x⩽m}=0 for x>m.One can also consider the class of unimodal distributions of X. Recall that a distribution F is said to be unimodal with mode M if it can be represented asF(x)=∫-∞yf(y)dyfor x<M, andF(x)=F(M+)-F(M-)+∫-∞xf(y)dyfor x⩾M, where the function f(x) is non-decreasing for x<M and non-increasing for x⩾M. Thus, the unimodal distribution F is allowed to have a discontinuity at M, and if F is continuous at M, that is F(M+)=F(M−)=F(M), then f(x) is the density function.A slightly different version of the following result was proven in Kamburowski (1989).Theorem 4Let X have a unimodal distribution on [a,b] with known mode M and moments μi=E[Xi] (i=0,1,2,…,k) that satisfy the non-boundary conditions. For every q∈[a,b], the sharp lower and upper bounds, L(q) and U(q), on E[min(X,q)] can be defined as follows:L(q)=maxci∑i=0kνicisubject to∑i=0kcixi⩽φ(x,q)forx∈[a,b].U(q)=minci∑i=0kνicisubject to∑i=0kcixi⩾φ(x,q)forx∈[a,b],where ν0=1, νi=(i+1)μi−iMμi−1for i=1,2,…,k, andφ(x,q)=q-(q-x)22(M-x)for x<q and q⩽M, φ(x,q)=q for x⩾q and q⩽M, φ(x,q)=μ1for x⩽q and q>M, andφ(x,q)=μ1-(x-q)22(x-M)for x>q and q>M.Theorem 3 can be easily extended to encompass the cases when some other percentiles are known. One can also combineTheorems 3 and 4 when the information about the median (or other percentiles) of the unimodal demand distribution is available.For the case of the known mean and variance of non-negative demand X and no shortage cost, Gallego and Moon (1993) showed three extensions of the distribution-free newsboy problem. They were further generalized by Alfares and Elmorra (2005) by assuming that the unit shortage cost is positive. These extensions include the fixed charge single-item problem, the random yield problem, and the resource-constrained multi-period problem. For all of them, one can apply the results presented in this paper. To illustrate, we consider the first of the listed extensions.Suppose fixed ordering cost A is charged for each order quantity q>0. If I⩾0 is the initial inventory, then Q=I+q units will be available before observing demand, min(X,Q) units will be sold at p, Q−min(X,Q) units at s, and the lost sales and the total ordering costs will be ℓ[X−min(X,Q)] and [c(Q−I)+A]1{Q>I}, respectively. Consequently, the expected profit is expressed byπ(Q)=pE[min(X,Q)]+sE[Q-min(X,Q)]-ℓ{μ-E[min(X,Q)]}-[c(Q-I)+A]1{Q>I}=(p+ℓ-s)E[min(X,Q)]+sQ-ℓμ-[c(Q-I)+A]1{Q>I}.When Q>I is assumed, the optimal Q∗ is the smallest Q such thatF(Q)⩾r=p+ℓ-cp+ℓ-s.Therefore, if Q∗>I and π(Q∗)>π(I), the order q∗=Q∗−I should be placed.When the information about distribution F is incomplete, one can seek sharp lower and upper bounds, L(Q) and U(Q), on E[min(X,Q)] to derive the corresponding sharp lower and upper bounds,π(Q) andπ¯(Q), on the expected profit π(Q). To identify the worst-case and best-case order quantitiesQ∗ andQ‾∗, it suffices to employ the extremal distributionsFandF‾with respect to the increasing concave order ≼icvdefined asF̲(Q)=1-d+L(Q)dQandF‾(Q)=1-d+U(Q)dQ.We presented new theoretical foundations for analyzing the newsboy problem under incomplete information about the probability distribution of random demand. Our main theoretical result stated in Section 2 shows the reduction of the distribution-free newsboy problem under the worst-case and best-case demand scenarios to the standard newsboy problem. We revealed this reduction by finding the relationship between the distribution-free newsboy problem and the notion of the increasing concave order.We observed that instead of using the maximin and maximax criteria, one can employ the Hurwicz criterion for a given coefficient of optimism α. Our future research will involve advanced experimental studies to identify the coefficient of optimism α for which this criterion produces a nearly optimal order quantity for different arbitrarily assumed demand distributions. We believe that α depends on the ratio r as well as on the skew of these distributions. The results with such optimal α’s could be then compared with those obtained by the use of the maximum entropy approach proposed in Andersson et al. (2013).In Section 3 we presented, in particular, the sharp bounds on the expected met demand E[min(X,q)] in the case of the known support [a,b], mean μ, and variance σ2. When the skewnessγ=E[X-μ]3σ3is additionally available, one can seek the analogous bounds under the non-boundary conditions: a<μ<b, 0<σ2<(μ−a)(b−μ), andσμ-a-μ-aσ<γ<b-μσ-σb-μ. Such bounds, however, require solutions of parametric cubic equations, and our future research will concentrate on finding such solutions. The future research might also examine the use of heuristic algorithms for the case k>3.The numerical example discussed in Section 5 illustrates how the scope of available information about the demand distribution affects the quality of the results. Of course, extensive simulation experiments are needed to evaluate the average and maximum errors induced by the use of the maximin and maximax criteria. Such experiments should also examine the impact of the support [a,b] on the results’ quality because it is well-known that this support might be difficult to estimate in practice.In Section 6 we presented two theorems that allow for examining the cases of the known mode of the unimodal demand distribution, and of the known median. It would be interesting to empirically examine what information is more valuable in addition to the given support and mean; about the variance, the mode or the median.Theorems 2–4 presented in this paper provide theoretical tools for solving the distribution-free newsboy problems under the worst-case and best-case demand scenarios. These theorems refer to some straight-forward cases covered by general Theorem 2.1 proven in the rather forgotten now excellent monograph of Karlin and Studden (1966, chap. XII). In recent literature one can find some theoretical results claimed as new ones that can be actually deduced from this powerful theorem.
