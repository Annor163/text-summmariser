@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Pairwise comparison is a key component in multi-criteria decision making. The probability of rank reversal is a useful measure for evaluating the impact of uncertainty on the final outcome. In the context of this paper the type of uncertainty considered is related to the fact that experts have different opinions or that they may perform inconsistent pairwise comparisons. We provide a theoretical model for estimating the probability of the consequent rank reversal using the multivariate normal cumulative distribution function. The model is applied to two alternative weight extraction methods frequently used in the literature: the geometric mean and the eigenvalue method. We introduce a reasonable framework for incorporating uncertainty in the decision making process and calculate the mean value and cross-correlation of the average weights which are required in the application of the model. The theoretical results are compared against numerical simulations and a very good agreement is observed. We further show how our model can be extended in applications of a full multi-criteria decision making analysis, such as the analytic hierarchy process. We also discuss how the theoretical model can be used in practice where the statistical properties of the uncertainty-induced perturbations are unknown and the only information provided by the pairwise comparison matrices of a small group of experts. The methodology presented here can be used to extend the pairwise comparison framework in order to provide some information on the credibility of its outcome.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Decision making is the process of choosing a specific course of action among several alternatives and is encountered in many areas of human activity (Altuzarra, Moreno-Jimenez, & Salvador, 2007). In situations where complex decisions need to be taken involving high stakes, it is desirable to base these decisions on the combined opinions of several experts in the field rather than simply rely on the skills and intuition of an individual decision maker. In the context of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) (Triantaphyllou, 2000; Yager, 2004) the first step is to identify a set of criteria on which the decision should be based and then decide on their importance. The pairwise comparison (PWC) method provides a convenient and reliable means to rank both the criteria involved in the decision making process and the alternative courses of action (Saaty, 2008a). In the context of PWC, instead of letting the experts rank the various criteria or alternatives directly, they compare these criteria in combinations of two. This can reduce the influence of subjective point-of-views associated with eliciting the weights directly.PWC plays a key role in structured decision making systems and especially in MCDM methods, such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the analytic network process (ANP) (Saaty, 2008b). In this context, PWC has been extensively used on numerous application areas (Chan et al., 2006; Gerdsri & Kocaoglu, 2007; Huang, Chub, & Chiang, 2008; Lee & Kozar, 2006; Liberatore & Nydick, 2008; Zahedi, 1986). PWC has also been applied on a stand-alone basis or on the context of a different decision making framework (Abildtrup et al., 2006; Dede, Varoutas, Kamalakis, Fuentetaja, & Javaudin, 2010; Doumpos & Zopounidis, 2004; Fan & Liu, 2010; Kok & Lootsma, 1985; Traulsen, Pacheco, & Nowak, 2007). Several contributions have attempted to highlight many methodological aspects of the method (Barzilai, 1997; Boenderb, Graan, & Lootsma, 1989; Choo & Wedley, 2004; Deng, 1999; Kwiesielewicz & Van Uden, 2004; Mamat & Daniel, 2007; Marimin, Umano, Hatono, & Tamura, 2002; Mikhailov, 2004).One important aspect of PWC is that the final outcome is undermined by uncertainty, which originates from the fact that the experts may produce inconsistent pairwise judgments or that their point-of-views can differ. Uncertainty modeling by itself is of paramount importance and has been the subject of many studies (András, 2007; Aull-Hyde, Erdogan, & Duke, 2006; Carmone, Karab, & Zanakis, 1997; Hahn, 2003; Harker, 1987; Hongyi & Kocaoglu, 2008; Klir & Folger, 1988; Saaty & Vargas, 1987; Stam & Silva, 1997; Shunsuke, Obata, & Daigo, 1998; Wang & Dong, 2009; Wang, Dong, & Yan, 2012; Wang, Yeung, & Tsang, 2001; Yager, 2002; Yuan & Shaw, 1995). The probability of rank reversal PRR(Saaty, 2003; Saaty & Vargas, 1984) is often a useful measure for evaluating the impact of uncertainty. We may define the probability of rank reversal theoretically, by considering the weights W1 ,…, WNwhere N is the number of alternatives, calculated by PWC in the case of an infinite group of experts (M→+∞). In practice, since the group size M is finite (M<+∞), the calculated weights wiwill in general turn out different than Wiand hence the ranking may also be different thus introducing an uncertainty in the final outcome. This uncertainty may originate in the difference of opinion among the experts which may bias the result compared to a large (asymptotically infinite) group of experts. The experts may also complete the pairwise comparison in an inconsistent manner (Saaty, 2003). The probability of rank reversal can be formally defined as (Dede, Kamalakis, & Sphicopoulos, 2015):(1)PRR=P{RankingofwiisdifferentthanthatofWi}In our previous work (Dede et al., 2015), we have investigated the convergence properties of the probability of rank reversal in PWC with respect to the size M of the group of experts. The results dictated that there is not much to be gained by increasing the number of experts beyond 15, even if the uncertainty level is large. Moreover, we examined the problem of how the probability of rank reversal can be estimated numerically using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Although this is a valid approach, it is often preferable to have a theoretical model for estimating the probability of rank reversal. A theoretical model is often much more straightforward to implement and requires much less computational time than MC simulations. It can also form a solid basis for understanding and extending the PWC application framework. In this paper we discuss how the probability of rank reversal PRRcan be estimated theoretically. We show that instead of using MC simulations, the PRRcan be estimated through the multivariate normal cumulative distribution function (MVNCDF). This approach is formulated for two alternative weight estimation methods: the eigenvalue (EV) (Saaty & Vargas, 1987) and the geometric mean (GM) method (Crawford, 1987). We show that the MVNCDF yields accurate results compared to MC simulations regardless of the number of criteria and the weight estimation method used. This approach seems to be useful for any potential decision maker willing to investigate the accuracy of the results in real decision problems in practice. We also show how the approach can be extended in the application of a full MCDM analysis, such as the AHP.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we briefly summarize the PWC method and discuss how one can incorporate uncertainty in the pairwise comparison matrices. In addition, we discuss the statistical nature of the uncertainty-induced weight perturbations in PWCs and calculate the mean values and the correlation matrices of the average weights required in the MVNCDF estimations. We also elaborate how the PRRcan be calculated using the MVNCDF and how the results can be applied in AHP. In Section 3, we validate our theoretical model against MC simulations. Section 4 provides some insight on how the model can be applied in a practical situation where the uncertainty parameters are unknown and can only be inferred by the pairwise comparison matrix elements of a limited number of experts. Some concluding remarks and future outlook are presented in Section 5.The judgment of the mth expert concerning any two criteria is stored in a square pairwise comparison matrix P(m) and each matrix element Pij(m) reflects the relative importance of criterion Cicompared to Cj. In order to complete the pairwise comparison matrices, two alternative methods widely used in the literature can be considered. In the first approach (referred to hereafter as method “A”), each expert is required to grade the relative importance between any two criteria Ciand Cjby assigning values between 0 and 100 (Gerdsri & Kocaoglu, 2007). Assuming that i<j, the mth expert assigns a value between 0 and 100 in the element Aij(m) of a matrix A(m) comparing the importance of criterion Cito criterion Cj. For example, if an expert assigns Aij(m)=60, then this implies that the weight of Ciis 60 percent compared to the total weight of both criteria, while that of Cjis 40 percent. Using the upper triangular elements of A(m), the elements of the pairwise comparison matrix are calculated setting Pij(m)=Aij(m)/(100−Aij(m)) for the upper diagonal elements (i<j), Pij(m)=1/Pij(m) for the lower diagonal elements (i>j) while Pii(m) are set equal to 1. According to the alternative approach (referred to hereafter as method “B”), proposed bySaaty (2008b), the nine-level scale shown in Table 1is used to carry out the comparisons. Again, one needs to complete only the upper triangular elements (i<j), since Pij(m)=1/Pji(m) and Pii(m)=1. This type of pairwise matrix completion will be referred as method “B” in the following analysis. In both cases, each experts is expected to carry out a total of N(N-1)/2 comparisons.After the experts have completed the pairwise matrices, one can calculate the weight wk(m) of criterion Ckaccording to the mth expert. For the extraction of the weights from a PWC matrix, several methods have been proposed. Two of the most popular ones are the EV and the GM methods. In the EV method the eigenvalues of P(m) are calculated and the eigenvector x1(m)=[x1k(m)] associated with the largest eigenvalue λmax(m) is determined (Saaty, 2003). The weight wk(m) are obtained normalizing the sum of the elements of x1(m) to unity,(2)wk(m)=x1k(m)[∑l=1Nx1l(m)]−1The PWC matrix is said to be perfectly consistent if all its elements are of the form Pij(m)=qi(m)/qj(m), where qi(m) are positive real numbers. If one assumes that all qi(m) are normalized so that Σiqi(m)=1 then it follows that wk(m)=qk(m). In practice however, the PWC matrices P(m) will generally be inconsistent since the experts perform their comparisons without having to conform to any such restrictions. The average weight wkfor each criterion Ckis calculated by averaging out the weights wk(m) calculated by all experts, i.e.:(3)wk=1M∑m=1Mwk(m)Alternatively, according to the GM method, the weight wk(m) is estimated based on the geometric mean of the PWC elements as follows:(4)wk(m)=(∏p=1NPkp(m))1NThe average weight wkfor each criterion Ckis calculated by estimating the geometric mean for the weights wk(m) calculated by all experts (Saaty, 1990; Saaty, 2008a) i.e.:(5)wk=(∏m=1Mwk(m))1MIn the absence of uncertainty, i.e. if all experts had identical opinion and carried out perfectly consistent comparisons, then in the case of method “A” one would obtain the ideal weights Wifor the alternatives and the pairwise matrices would be given by Pij(m)=Wi/Wjfor every value of m, 1≤m≤M. We may therefore think that the elements Pij=Wi/Wjare the elements of an ideal pairwise comparison matrix P obtained by every expert when no uncertainty is present. For method “B”, we assume that each element of the ideal pairwise comparison matrix Pijis determined by the value of Table 1 closest to Wi/Wj.In practice we expect that each expert will complete a different pairwise comparison matrix and hence the weights wkand quite possibly their ranking may turn out different than that obtained by Wi. We understand that the distribution of the ideal weights Wiwill have an important bearing on PRR, since the probability of rank reversal should increase when the differences between the Wi’s are small and hence the effect of uncertainty-induced perturbations will be more pronounced. Without any loss of generality, we can choose the ordering of Ci, so that Wi−1 ≥ Wifor 1≤i≤N implying that the criteria are labeled in such a way that criterion Ci−1 has greater or equal importance compared to criterion Ci. We define L as the ratio between the maximum and the minimum weight L=max{Wi}/min{Wi}. This ratio is a measure of the non-uniformity of the ideal weights and in the presence of uncertainty, we expect that PRRwill increase as L approaches to unity. Assuming for simplicity that the weights Wilie on a straight line it is easy to show that:(6)Wi=2N(L+1)(L+(i−1)(1−L)(N−1))Eq. (6) is derived by assuming that the weights lie on a straight line and that they have unity sum,∑iWi=1. Alternatively, the original weights could also be determined by a nonlinear distribution such as the beta distribution Bi=Nwia−1(1−i)b−1 where the normalization factor Nwis chosen so that the sum of Biis again equal to 1. Fig. 1illustrates some of the possible linear and nonlinear distributions for the original weights Wi. For the beta-distributed weights we assume that the ideal weight distribution Wiare obtained from Bi, sorting them in descending order, so that Wi−1≥Wi.We now discuss how uncertainties can be introduced in method “A”. Since experts do not all share the same point of view, we can define individual initial weights Wi(m) for the mth expert as:(7)Wi(m)=Wi(1+Δwi(m))where Δwi(m) can be considered independently identically distributed (IID), zero mean random perturbations. Since each participant completes his pairwise comparison without necessarily having to produce a consistent matrix we also add another random perturbation Δwij(m) describing the deviation of the matrix elements from their perfectly consistent form Wi(m)/Wj(m). For i<j, we assume that the elements of the matrix P(m)=[Pij(m)] are determined by:(8)Pij(m)=Wi(m)Wj(m)(1+Δwij(m))According to (8), the elements of the pairwise comparison matrix P(m) are obtained by perturbing the ideal pairwise comparison matrix P=[Pij] by ΔP(m), i.e. P(m)=P+ΔP(m) where the elements of ΔP(m)=[ΔPij(m)] are determined by:(9)ΔPij(m)=Wi(m)Wj(m)(1+Δwij(m))−WiWjThe addition of perturbations in the pairwise comparison matrices is a common way of incorporating uncertainty (Escobar & Moreno-Jiménez, 2007; Genz & Bretz, 2002; Paulson & Zahir, 1995; Zarghami, Szidarovszky, & Ardakanian, 2008). Note that (7) does not guarantee that the sum of the weights ∑iWi(m) is equal to 1 but according to Eq. (9), the elements Pij(m) do not depend on the normalization of the Wi(m). For i>j, we simply set Pij(m)=1/Pji(m) in accordance to Section 2.1. In (8), Δwij(m) are perturbations describing the relative deviation of the elements of matrix P(m) from their ideal perfectly consistent form and in the absence of any inconsistencies (Δwij(m)=0) the weights calculated by (2) or (4) are simply wi(m)=Wi(m). The perturbations Δwij(m) can also be assumed IID with zero mean value. Their distribution can be assumed uniform inside [−s/2,s/2] and [−sw/2,sw/2] respectively with variances σ2=〈(Δwij(m))2〉=s2/12 and σw2=〈(Δwi(m))2〉=sw2/12. We will refer to s and swas the perturbation strength for Δwij(m) for Δwi(m), respectively. For method “B” we simply assume that the elements of the matrix Pij(m) are determined by the elements of the scale in Table 1 which are closest to the right hand side of (8). We will discuss the impact of the actual perturbation statistics in Section 2.4.At this point, it is useful to summarize the assumptions introduced in our model. Regarding the original weights Wi, these are chosen to lie on a straight line, mainly for reasons of simplicity. The results presented in the next sections hold regardless of the distribution of Wi. Regarding the uncertainty-induced perturbations, these are assumed random, naturally reflecting the way in which the experts carry out their PWCs, incorporating their subjective point-of-views and inconsistency errors in their judgments. Several authors in the literature use a similar approach (Hahn, 2003; Hahn, 2006; Hauser & Tadikamalla, 1996; Mikhailov, 2004; Paulson & Zahir, 1995; Saaty & Vargas, 1987; Zarghami et al., 2008). The perturbations are taken zero mean because otherwise, the weights calculated in the limit of a very large group of experts (M→∞), would not converge to the weights Wi. This is shown in Section 2.3. The perturbations Δwij(m) are considered identically distributed and this holds for Δwi(m) as well. One could postulate a more general model, where the statistics may vary from expert to expert. However the application of the central limit theorem discussed in Section 2.4, indicates that the weight statistics wkare not altered and the MVNCDF still applies with suitable modifications of the covariance matrices given in Section 2.5.The statistical independence of the perturbations across the pairwise comparison matrices of the experts (i.e. for different m) is a consequence of how they complete their comparisons, typically independent of one another, without knowledge of each other's point-of-view. This implies that when summing up the weights wk(m) with respect to m in (3) in the eigenvalue method for instance, these should be considered independent. As we will discuss in Section 2.4, their mean value wktherefore converges to a normal distribution as a consequence of the central limit theorem (Rice, 1995). We will also show in Section 2.4, that in the eigenvalue method, the weights wk(m) are a linear combination of the pairwise comparison matrix element perturbations. Therefore, if we postulate that the perturbations of the elements within the same pairwise comparison matrix of an expert (i.e. the same m) are independent themselves, the distribution of each individual wk(m) will converge to a normal distribution. Whether the independence between the elements of the same pairwise matrix always holds is a much more involved subject and even if some level of dependence exists, it is rather difficult to choose an appropriate model for this correlation. We have therefore decided to ignore these correlations, since the assumption of normal statistics for the outcomes wkin the eigenvalue method is reasonable anyway on account of the statistical independence of wk(m) for different experts, as explained in detail in Section 2.4. Similar arguments hold for the logarithmic weights estimated by the GM method as discussed further below.We now briefly summarize the MC method for the estimation of PRRadapted from (Dede et al., 2015), which will prove useful in validating our theoretical model. The activity diagram for the numerical estimation of PRRis shown in Fig. 2. Initially, given the value of L we estimate the ideal weights Wiusing (6). We then perform a number of MC iterations and in each iteration we calculate the weights Wi(m) for a group of M experts using (7), randomly selecting Δwi(m). We then generate the perturbations Δwij(m) and the corresponding pairwise comparison matrices P(m) according to (8). Once the elements of P(m) are evaluated, we apply the procedure described in Section 2.1 to evaluate the weights wi(m) and then average wi(m) over m, using (3) for the case of EV or (5) for the GM method, to estimate the average weights wi, checking whether a rank reversal has occurred. Repeating this over many MC iterations (≥104), we can calculate the PRR.In Section 2, we discussed two alternative methods for completing the elements of the PWC matrix. Fig. 3(a) and (b) depicts the probability of rank reversal for both approaches, in the case of EV and GM method, respectively, where N=4 and L=2. We use the procedure outlined in Fig. 2, varying the number of experts M from 4 to 40. For each PRRvalue we used NMC=105 iterations. Three perturbations strengths are considered, namely s=sw=0.4, s=sw=1 and s=sw=1.4 corresponding to a maximum allowable deviation of ±20 percent, ±50 percent and ±70 percent. Inspection of the results reveals that PRRis practically the same for both completion methods, regardless of whether EV or GM method is used. This implies that the outcome of PWC is undermined at the same manner regardless of the completion method, which should not come as a great surprise since the elements of the pairwise comparison matrices in method “B” are quantized versions of the elements of method “A”. In light of the similarity of the results obtained by the two methods in the following we need only carry out the analysis for method “A”.We should pay attention to some of the assumptions made above in previous sections. Regarding the mean value of Δwi(m) it is natural to assume that 〈Δwi(m)〉=0, otherwise a large group of experts would produce different weights than Wi. The reason for choosing 〈Δwij(m)〉=0 is similar: If all experts share the same opinion, i.e. Wi(m)=Withen the weights produced by a large group of experts should be equal to Wi. To verify this, Figs. 4(a) and 5(a) show the weights obtained by the PWCs, for the case of EV and GM method respectively, for M=103 in the case where s=2, N=6, L=2 and where 〈Δwij(m)〉=0. As shown in the figures, the weights wicalculated by 103 experts are almost identical to Wi. We therefore deduce that when 〈Δwij(m)〉=0, the weights wido converge to their ideal values Wiwhen either the EV or the GM methods is used for the extraction of the weights. In the same context, Figs. 4(b) and 5(b) show the corresponding weights for the EV and GM method respectively in the case where 〈Δwij(m)〉 is nonzero and instead equal to 0.4. It is interesting to see that there is a noticeable difference between wiand Wiin this case and in fact wicorrespond to a larger value of L, i.e. a positive 〈Δwij(m)〉 has the effect of making the weights more distinct. This can be understood from (8). Comparing the average value of μij=〈Pij(m)〉 in the case where 〈Δwij(m)〉=0 and μ΄ij=〈Pij(m)〉 in the case where 〈Δwij(m)〉=μ>0, we easily see from (8) thatμij′=μij(1+μ)>μijimplying that the experts tend to produce more biased comparisons, which will further distinguish the values of the weights. We therefore conclude that the perturbations should be taken zero mean because otherwise, the weights calculated in the limit of a very large group of experts (M→∞) would not converge to the weights calculated by the ideal matrix P.In this section we theoretically investigate the statistical nature of the weight perturbations, under the uncertainty model proposed in the previous section. Considering the EV method, we start from the first order variation Δx1(m) of the principal eigenvector x1(m) induced by a matrix perturbation ΔP(m) (Saaty & Ozdemir, 2003):(10)Δx1(m)=x1(m)−x1=∑j=2N(υjTΔP(m)x1(λ1−λj)υjTxj)xjwhere υiand xiare the left and right eigenvectors of P while λiare the corresponding eigenvalues and λ1 the maximum (principal) eigenvalue. Expanding the matrix products of (10) in terms of the individual matrix and vector elements, it is revealed that, to first order, the elements of the principal perturbation vector Δx1(m)=[Δx1p(m)] are a linear combination of the elements of the perturbation matrix ΔPij(m). This fact has an important bearing on the statistics of the perturbed weights: if one assumes that a large number of the perturbations ΔPij(m) are uncorrelated, then taking into account the central limit theorem (Rice, 1995), Δx1k(m) and consequently x1k(m) will asymptotically follow a Gaussian distribution as their number tends to infinity. Since the weights wk(m) are normalized versions of x1k(m) we therefore expect that they will also asymptotically follow a Gaussian distribution and this would also hold for the average weights estimated by (3). This can be deduced by considering the change δwk(m) in the weights wk(m). In (2), we write x1k(m)=x1k+Δx1k(m) obtaining,(11)wk(m)=Wk+δwk(m)=x1k+Δx1k(m)∑l=1Nx1l+∑l=1NΔx1l(m)The right hand side of (11) is a fraction of the form (a+Δa)/(β+Δβ) where a=x1k, Δa=Δx1k(m), β=∑lx1land Δβ=∑lΔx1l(m) while the unperturbed fraction (Δa=Δβ=0) is the original weight Wk, i.e. a/β=Wk. As long as the perturbations are small, we have Δa<<a and Δβ<<β and therefore the right hand side of (11) can be written as:(12)a+Δaβ+Δβ=aβ(1+Δa/a1+Δβ/β)≅aβ(1+Δaa)(1−Δββ)=aβ(1+Δaa−Δββ−ΔaΔβaβ)≅aβ(1+Δaa−Δββ)where in the first approximate equation, we used Taylor's expansion to first order, (1+Δβ/β)−1≅1−Δβ/β. The second approximation in (12) is based on the fact that the term (Δa/a)(Δβ/β) is of second order and can therefore be ignored compared to 1+(Δa/a−Δβ/β) which contains up to first order terms. Substituting the values of a and β in (12) we obtain:(13)δwk(m)=wk(m)−Wk=x1k+Δx1k(m)∑j=1Nx1j+∑j=1NΔx1j(m)−Wk≅Wk{Δx1k(m)x1k−1β∑j=1NΔx1j(m)}The average weight perturbations are:(14)δwk=wk−Wk=1M∑m=1Mδwk(m)=WkM∑m=1M{Δx1k(m)x1k−1β∑j=1NΔx1j(m)}The above equation suggests that since Δx1p(m) is a linear combination of ΔPij(m), the perturbations δwkwill also be asymptotically Gaussian. As a consequence, the statistics of the uncertainty perturbations ΔPij(m) will asymptotically influence the variance of the Gaussian-like distributed weights wk(m) and not the actual statistical behavior (e.g. the shape of the PDF).The Gaussian-like behavior is to be expected in the case of the GM method is used. In this case however, it applies to the logarithmic weights zk=ln(wk) instead of the linear weights wk. Indeed, by substituting (4) in (5) and taking the logarithm, we obtain:(15)zk=lnwk=1NM∑m=1M∑p=1NlnPkp(m)=1NM∑m=1M∑p=1N{Wk(m)Wp(m)(1+Δwkp(m))}Eq. (15) states that the logarithmic weights zkare the sum of NM random variables most of which are independent, and hence zkwill also asymptotically be a Gaussian random variable. Although the above conclusions are derived in the limiting case where NM→∞ we can numerically show that the shape of the PDF for wkand zkin the case of the EV and GM methods is approximately Gaussian for finite values of N and M as well. The results are shown in Figs. 6and 7for a typical weight assuming N=4 or N=6 and M=15, NMC=105, L=2, sw=0 and s=1.5 for the EV and GM methods respectively. Also shown is the Gaussian fit. We clearly see in Fig. 6, that in the case of the EV, the PDF of the average weight wkis indeed very well described by a Gaussian distribution and this is also the case for zkin Fig. 7. Similar results are obtained for the rest of the weights as well as for other values of N, M and s. The fact that the PDF of the weights or the logarithmic weights are nearly Gaussian is consistent with the central limit theorem discussed above and illustrates that the precise statistics of the perturbations will mainly influence the two parameters determining the normal distribution, i.e. its mean value and standard deviation. This is an interesting conclusion, implying that as long as the judgments among different experts are sufficiently uncorrelated, then the underlying uncertainty model plays a minor role in the statistical behavior of the weights, other than determining the aforementioned parameters of their PDF.As described in Section 2.2, the ideal weights Wkare chosen so that Wk−1≥Wkfor 2≤k≤N. In the event of no rank reversal, one would therefore have wk−1≥wk. In the case of the EV method, the average perturbations of the weights are determined as δwk=wk−Wkand in the absence of any rank reversal we will have W1+δw1≥W2+δw2≥…≥WN+δwN. The probability of no rank reversal Pnis therefore Pn=P(δw1−δw2>W2−W1,...,δwN−1−δwN>WN−WN−1) while the probability of rank reversal is simply PRR=1−Pn.Since yk=δwk−δwk−1 will follow a Gaussian-like distribution (Section 2.4), PRRcan be approximated by the MVNCDF, once the covariance matrix and the mean values of ykare determined (Genz & Bretz, 2002). It is easy to see that 〈yk〉=〈δwk〉−〈δwk−1〉 and the covariance matrix is:(16)Cκμ=〈yκyμ〉−〈yκ〉〈yμ〉=cκμ−cκ,μ−1−cκ−1,μ+cκ−1,μ−1−〈yκ〉〈yμ〉where cij=〈δwiδwj〉.

(16)–(21) can be used to determine the mean values and the covariance matrix of the weight perturbations that can be used to calculate the MVNCDF which as previously discussed provides an estimate for PRR.In a similar way we can estimate the PRRthrough the MVNCDF in the case where the GM method is used for the estimation of the weights from the PWC matrices. Taking into account the uncertainty model, analyzed in the Section 2.2, the average weights wkcan be expressed as follows:(22)wk=Wk(∏m=1M∏j=1Nδkj(m)Wj)1MNwhere(23)δkp=1+Δwk(m)1+Δwp(m)(1+Δwkp(m))We define the perturbations δzkof the logarithmic weights as δzk=lnwk−lnWkand also define their successive differences vk=δzk−δzk−1 which follow a Gaussian distribution (Section 2.4). The PRRcan be approximated from the MVNCDF once the covariance matrix and the mean values of νkare determined. Taking into account that 〈vk〉=〈δzk〉−〈δzk−1〉 the covariance matrix is:(24)Rκλ=〈vκvλ〉−〈vκ〉〈vλ〉=rκλ−rκ,μ−1−rκ−1,μ+rκ−1,μ−1where rij=〈δziδzj〉−〈δzi〉〈δzj〉 is the correlation matrix.

(22)–(30) determine the covariance matrix and hence the MVNCDF can be used to provide an estimate for the PRRin the case of GM method as well. The above equations hold regardless of the initial weight distribution Wi.In the previous section we have proposed a model for the estimation of PRRfrom pairwise comparisons using the MVNCDF. It would be interesting to apply this methodology for the evaluation of the PRRof the final ranking of the alternatives in a full MCDA method involving several PWCs matrices to estimate the weights. We sketch this in the case of the AHP as one example in this section, but similar analysis could be applied for other MCDA techniques as well.We assume that the hierarchy includes N criteria and V alternatives. In order to rate the alternatives, one must first evaluate the weights of the criteria, denoted by wk, where k is an integer between 1≤k≤N. The alternatives should also be pairwise compared according to each criterion and for each alternative one obtains the relative scores sikunder criterion Ck. Assuming that wkand sikare calculated using GM method, the final ranking priorities tiof the alternative i (1≤i≤V) can be evaluated by multiplying the relative scores sikby the weight wkof the corresponding criterion and using either the geometric mean as follows (Ramanathan & Ganesh, 1994):(31)ti=(∏k=1Nwksik)1NWe will now show how the formulas of GM in Section 2.5, can be used for the estimation of PRRfor the final priorities of the alternatives ti. We define the perturbations δtiof the logarithmic priorities as δti=lnti−lnTiand using (31) we obtain:(32)δti=1N∑k=1N(lnwk+lnsik)−lnTiwhere lnTiare the priorities obtained when M→∞. Assuming that wkand sikare statistically independent, it is easy to see that 〈δti〉 is given by:(33)〈δti〉=1N∑k=1N{〈δzk〉+〈δsik〉}where similar to Section 2.5, we have defined δzk=lnwk−lnWkand δsik=lnsik−lnSikas the logarithmic perturbations of the weights and the relative scores with respect to their original values Wkand Sikobtained when M→∞. The average values 〈δzk〉 and 〈δsik〉 can be obtained through (25) by replacing the statistical variances s and swwith their corresponding values for the criteria or the relative scores respectively. In a similar manner, the covariance matrix Yij=〈δtiδtj〉−〈δti〉〈δtj〉 is calculated using (32),(34)Yij=〈δtiδtj〉−〈δti〉〈δtj〉=1N2∑kl{Rkl+δijDklij}where Rkl=〈δzkδzl〉−〈δzk〉〈δzl〉 and Dklij=〈δsikδsjl〉−〈δsik〉〈δsjl〉 are the covariance matrices of δzkand δsikwhile can be calculated using the framework presented in Section 2.5 and specifically (24) and (26), while δijis 1 if i=j and zero otherwise. Since the mean values and the covariance matrix of δtican be estimated, we may apply the MVNCDF to obtain the probability of rank reversal for the final outcomes of the AHP.Alternatively, if we use the EV method for the estimation of the weights and relative scores, then the final rankings tican be calculated as (Ramanathan & Ganesh, 1994):(35)ti=1N∑k=1NwksikIn this case, we define δti=ti−Tiand using (35) we now obtain:(36)〈δti〉=∑k=1N〈δwk〉〈δσik〉+〈δwk〉Sik+〈δσik〉Wk(37)Xij=〈δtiδtj〉−〈δti〉〈δtj〉=∑k=1N∑l=1N{CklHklij−WkWlSikSjl}where Cklis the covariance matrix of δwk, estimated in previous section and Ηklijis the corresponding covariance matrix of δσik=sik−Sik. The mean values in (36) can be obtained using (17) by replacing the statistical variances s and swwith their corresponding values for the criteria or the relative scores respectively. The same is true for the covariance Ckland Ηklijwhich can be obtained through (16), (18) and (19).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we consider the implications of uncertainty related to the fact that experts have different opinions or that they may perform inconsistent pairwise comparisons. Towards this end, we have discussed a theoretical method for calculating the probability of the consequent rank reversal, which quantifies the uncertainty of the outcome of pair wise comparisons. The method is based on the MVNCDF of the successive average weight differences. This was carried out both for the eigenvalue and the geometric mean methods of estimating the weights. Our approach relies on reasonable assumptions regarding the perturbations of the PWC matrices, taking into account both the difference of opinions among the experts and the inconsistency in the completion of the pairwise comparison matrices. Based on these, we theoretically calculated the mean value and cross-correlation matrices of these differences that are needed in order to correctly use the MVNCDF. The applicability of the MVNCDF can also be derived under more general assumptions, as discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.4. The value of the theoretical method is two-fold: first, it simplifies the estimation procedure, since we no longer need to rely on tedious and time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations used in numerical estimations of the probability of rank reversal. Second, much like any theoretical model, it can constitute a good starting point for further developing and extending the PWC framework. We also show how our results can be applied in determining the credibility of the final outcomes in two variants of the AHP method. We have compared the results obtained through the MVNCDF, with those obtained through numerical simulations and a good agreement is observed. The results obtained by either method also show a slight advantage of the geometric mean method over the eigenvalue method in terms of the probability of rank reversal. Finally, we discuss a procedure for estimating the probability of rank reversal in practice, where the statistical parameters are unknown. We show how that these parameters can be estimated just from the pairwise comparison matrices of the experts and that the error in the probability of rank reversal is reasonable. The methodology presented in the paper can be used to extend the pairwise comparison framework in order to provide some information on the credibility of the final outcomes of the decision making process. The proposed method could be applied from any decision maker willing to estimate the PRRand investigate the accuracy of the results and hence the stability of a right decision in real decision making problems in practice. Besides, nowadays an effective decision seems to be of paramount importance, especially in a demanding business environment.
