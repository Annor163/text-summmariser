@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Surface development is used in many manufacturing planning operations, e.g., for garments, ships and automobiles. However, most freeform surfaces used in design are not developable, and therefore the developed patterns are not isometric to the original design surface. In some domains, the CAD model is created by interpolating two given space curves. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain a G2 quasi-developable Bezier surface interpolating two arbitrary space curves. The given curves are first split into a number of piecewise Bezier curves and elemental Bezier patches each of which passes through four splitting points are constructed. All neighboring elemental patches are G2 connected and they are assembled optimally in terms of the degree of developability (the integral Gaussian curvature). Experiments show that the final composite Bezier surface is superior to a lofted one which is defined regardless of the final surface developability.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Surface developability is highly demanded for manufacturing considerations in industrial applications like garment design  [1], sheet-metal forming  [2–4] and windshield design  [5], in which products are often made from planar patterns by welding, pumping or sewing. In these industries, designers often sketch out two space curves, and hope to interpolate them with a developable or nearly developable surface. In practice, the designer uses a loft or skinning method to build a NURBS surface passing through the given curves, and then analyzes the resultant surface to see whether it can be flattened into one or several planar patterns within the allowable distortion. If not, the curves will be repeatedly modified until the desired developability of the loft surface can be obtained. Lofting or skinning is only a general interpolating method which disregards the developability geometric constraint; they suffer from among others one particular problem: the curves may have been modified too much to meet the developability constraint that their final shapes no longer represent the designer’s original intent. Furthermore, if curves themselves are complicated, using the above method to model a developable surface will often become impossible.In this paper, we propose a novel method to construct aG2composite of four-sided Bezier patches to interpolate two arbitrary space curves. These patches are optimally assembled together in terms of developability. The algorithm is inspired by the work of  [6]. The work of  [6] uses planar triangles to interpolate two polylines and an optimal triangulation can be obtained from the given polylines. Our work extends it to polynomial surfaces, and each pair of the neighboring patches will beG2connected, while in  [6] planar triangles are onlyG0connected (see Fig. 1).G2continuity is sometimes necessary for the purpose of both aesthetic and functional requirement in engineering. For example, in CAM design,G2can avoid creating abrupt changes on a surface; in sheet metal applications such as a ship hull and the wing and body of an aircraft,G2can prevent flow separation and turbulence. In parametric developable surface design, due to high complexity, most works deal with onlyG1continuity, while our objective is to design aG2composite Bezier surface to interpolate two given space curves.In our work, as the tile elements are Bezier patches instead of planar triangles, we do not require the distance between the two given curves to be much shorter than the lengths of the given curves  [6]. In addition, theG2continuity rather thanG0in  [7,6,8] andG1in  [9] bring along pleasing visual results preferred in many industrial applications. Our entire problem can be decomposed into two-sub ones: (1) how to construct aG2Bezier patch with only the local information of its four corner points, as in the construction process the exact parametric form of its neighboring elemental patch is yet to be decided; and (2) how to modify the algorithm in  [6] (which uses flat triangles only) to accord to a four-sided Bezier patch assembly.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section  2 reviews the related works. Section  3 defines the problem, with the problem formulation and a general description of our proposed algorithm. Sections  4 and 5 provide details of our methodology, while Section  6 shows the experimental results with discussions. Section  7 concludes the paper.
