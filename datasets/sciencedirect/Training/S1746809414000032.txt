@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A simple, real time, differential operator based spike detection algorithm has been described, which can efficiently detect seizure spikes in noisy ECoG signals. Simultaneous spikes and inverted spikes have been detected across all focal ECoG channels during preictal, ictal and postictal periods. Out of 79 seizures recorded from 21 patients, about 80% showed more occurrence of simultaneous spikes and inverted spikes across focal channels after the seizure offset than during the seizure in 0–40Hz range, where the duration studied after the offset is equal to the duration of the seizure. This is an important finding because this goes contrary to the prevailing wisdom that epileptic seizure is a hyper-synchronous phenomenon.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Epileptic seizures are marked by spikes and sharp waves in the electrophysiological signals both on the scalp (Latka et al. [1]; Godoy et al. [2]) and in depth recordings (Godoy et al. [2]). Also epileptic seizures are characterized by hyper-synchronous neuronal activities (Fisher et al. [3]). Single cell studies of human focal seizures in and around the focal region have revealed a complex pattern of synchronous activity in the neurons. In the beginning of the seizure neurons fire heterogeneously. The firing becomes more and more homogeneous as the seizure progresses toward the termination (Truccolo et al. [4]). In other words, single cell recordings show more and more simultaneous or correlated spiking activities toward the end of seizure than in the beginning.Automatic spike detection in electrophysiological signals is an active area of research (Latka et al. [1]; Pan and Tompkin [5]; Obeid and Wolf [6]; Quiroga et al. [7]; Shahid et al. [8]). It has been shown in Majumdar [9] that first and second order differential operators can augment the epileptic spikes relative to the background electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals. Seizure focal ECoG is a convenient signal for analyzing spiking behavior of the epileptic focus. Where multi-channel focal ECoG signal is available, studies on how synchronously or asynchronously spikes occur in those channels before, during and after seizure can offer us an insight into the seizure (termination) dynamics at neuronal ensemble level consisting of several thousand cells (Buzsaki et al. [10]).Efficacy of differential operators in accentuating epileptic spikes in the ECoG signals was demonstrated in Majumdar [9] and Majumdar and Vardhan [11]. For a focal ECoG signal x(t), the seizure spikes gets enhanced at x′(t) with respect to the background (Majumdar [9]; Majumdar and Vardhan [11]), where x′(t) is the first order difference with respect to t. This particular property of differentiation of the seizure EEG has been observed in White et al. [12]. The same is also true for x″(t) (Majumdar [9]). Both x′(t) and x″(t) have been combined to devise a robust method to detect epileptic spikes and inverted spikes in focal ECoG signals, which works with high accuracy even in presence of a good amount of noise. With this novel method simultaneous occurrence of spikes and inverted spikes across all the focal channels has been measured during and after the offset of seizures. Duration after the offset has been taken equal to the duration of the seizure. Out of 79 seizures (there have to be adequate data after the offset, for which 8 other seizures could not be tested) of 21 patients, 82.28% have shown more simultaneous spikes occurred across all 3 focal channels after the offset than during the seizure and 77.22% have shown occurrence of more simultaneous inverted spikes. This happened even for patients whose seizure foci were significantly apart.
