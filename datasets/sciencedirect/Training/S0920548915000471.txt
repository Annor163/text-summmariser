@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We present the deficiencies of traditional identity-based authorization models in structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks where users' Public Key Certificates (PKCs) represent two roles, authentication and authorization, and the access to the network resources is controlled by Access Control Lists (ACLs). With these deficiencies in mind, we propose a complete new framework for authorization in structured P2P networks based on Attribute Certificates (ACs) and a fully distributed certificate revocation system. We argue that the proposed framework yields a more flexible and secure authorization scheme for structured P2P networks while improving the efficiency of the assignment of privileges.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Early Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems were intended for file-sharing purposes which determine the guidelines adopted by access control solutions deployed in such networks. Their open-nature and the free availability of shared resources motivated researchers to focus more on restricting the number of malicious nodes in the network than implementing an authentication and authorization mechanism per se. However, in recent years several P2P applications (audio and video conferencing, multi-party games, content distribution, etc.) have emerged which require a more fine-grained access control.Several alternative schemes have been proposed in the literature to try to solve the access control problem for this type of applications for decentralized architectures and the lack of centralized online infrastructures. Structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems use: Internet Protocol (IP) based [1] access control, web of trust [2], shared secret [3], decentralized certification [4] or offline certification [3,5]. Regardless of the specific model used, one property is common to all of them: Public Key Certificates (PKCs) (either self-signed or by a Trusted Third Party (TTP)) are used for the authentication of users. However, these PKCs represent two roles: user's authentication (who the user is) and user's authorization (privileges of the user in the network: usernames allowing the user to join the network and to have a location in the ID space to store its resources, nodeIDs establishing its location in the network and the resources it is responsible for, storage quota limiting the amount of data it can store in the network, etc.). Also, PKCs are complemented by using Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control the access to the network resources.However, the fact that PKCs are used for both authentication and authorization of users is not a good idea [6]. Including the identity and the privileges of a user (username, nodeID, services contracted, etc.) into the same certificate requires that both the identity and any privileges should have the same lifetime and should be issued by the same authority. In addition, every time a new privilege is added, removed or changed the certificate should be revoked and a new one should be created. This authorization approach is inefficient and does not consider scenarios where the identity of the users and their privileges are provided by different entities.In the same way, ACLs perform well in operating systems or client–server architectures but not in structured P2P networks. In order to be usable, ACL's content has to be made public (to let the reader verify that the resource it is accessing has been created by an authorized user) revealing all the users' privileges over a resource and, therefore, affecting the privacy of users. Moreover, the fact that all the resource's replicas should be contacted in order to modify the resource's ACL for granting a new user privileges over it, makes this approach inefficient.Finally, despite the fact that most P2P applications use short-lived PKCs, the different nature of the privileges that can be assigned in a P2P system and the existence of applications with special security requirements, would make revocation of privileges desirable in some cases. Unfortunately, existing alternatives based on centralized servers (such as the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) servers [7]) or trusted intermediary authorities (such as the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders [8,9]), that should be contacted each time a certificate has to be checked, are not an option for P2P systems.One specific example of protocol using the before commented techniques (PKC+ACL), and therefore suffering from all the commented drawbacks, is the IETF P2P standard REsource Location and Discovery (RELOAD) protocol [3] and its usage for shared resources [10]. RELOAD is the only existing standard for P2P networks and, although it was initially designed with P2PSIP in mind, it can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements, such as Scribe or P2PCast [11].Considering the above limitations of the existing authorization approaches (including the only existing standard RELOAD) for structured P2P networks, in this paper we present an new authentication framework for structured P2P networks based on the recently published Internet Attribute Certificate Profile for Authorization [6] that we adapt and extend to make it suitable for structured P2P networks.The main contributions of this paper are:1.We present an analysis of the deficiencies of traditional identity-based authorization models in structured P2P networks showing their lack of flexibility, efficiency and privacy in the assignment of privileges.We propose and present a general framework for authorization in structured P2P networks that not only solves the identified deficiencies but homogenizes the access control under a unique authorization schema. Our framework is intended for structured P2P networks where user resources are distributed over the network, but it could be used with any P2P system that uses PKC as source of authentication.We present of a distributed revocation system that can be established within the structured P2P network and does not require the intervention of any external server or trusted intermediate authority.We evaluate (both theoretically and with simulations) of our framework by applying it to the RELOAD protocol and by comparing it against the RELOAD's original identity-based authorization model concluding that the proposed approach's separation between authentication and authorization supports a more flexible and secure authorization scheme while simultaneously improving the efficiency of the assignment of privileges.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce structured P2P networks, Attribute Certificates and present an overview of existing access control mechanisms for structured P2P networks along with their drawbacks which are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents our proposed framework for authorization in structured P2P networks. In Section 5 we evaluate the proposed approach by applying it to RELOAD and comparing it with the RELOAD's identity-based model. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions of the research conducted in this paper.
