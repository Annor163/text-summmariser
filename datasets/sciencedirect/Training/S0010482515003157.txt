@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundOne of the current methods for measuring intraocular pressure is the air-puff method. A tonometer which uses this method is the Corvis device. With the ultra-high-speed (UHS) Scheimpflug camera, it is also possible to observe corneal deformation during measurement. The use of modern image analysis and processing methods allows for analysis of higher harmonics of corneal deflection above 100Hz.Method493 eyes of healthy subjects and 279 eyes of patients with keratoconus were used in the measurements. For each eye, 140 corneal deformation images were recorded during intraocular pressure measurement. Each image was recorded every 230µs and had a resolution of 200×576 pixels. A new, original algorithm for image analysis and processing has been proposed. It enables to separate the eyeball reaction as well as low-frequency and high-frequency corneal deformations from the eye response to an air puff. Furthermore, a method for classification of healthy subjects and patients with keratoconus based on decision trees has been proposed.ResultsThe obtained results confirm the possibility to distinguish between patients with keratoconus and healthy subjects. The features used in this classification are directly related to corneal vibrations. They are only available in the proposed software and provide specificity of 98%, sensitivity-85%, and accuracy-92%. This confirms the usefulness of the proposed method in this type of classification that uses corneal vibrations during intraocular pressure measurement with the Corvis tonometer.DiscussionWith the new proposed algorithm for image analysis and processing allowing for the separation of individual features from a corneal deformation image, it is possible to: automatically measure corneal vibrations in a few characteristic points of the cornea, obtain fully repeatable measurement of vibrations for the same registered sequence of images and measure vibration parameters for large inter-individual variability in patients.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Keratoconus is one of the diseases of the cornea characterized by changes in its structure [1,2]. These changes usually lead to thinning and excessive bulging of the cornea [3]. As a result, there occurs a change in the corneal curvature [4,5]. The cornea takes a conical shape, which in turn causes visual difficulties [6]. Keratoconus is the most common corneal dystrophy. It has no ethnic restrictions and is not directly related to the degree of progress of civilisation [7,8]. The disease is relatively unknown, has indeterminate etiology and its course is difficult to predict. Due to corneal thinning, it also has an impact on changes in the biomechanical properties of the cornea. It should be visible in a special way in the sequence of corneal deformation images during intraocular pressure measurement using the air-puff method, e.g. when performing measurement with the Corvis tonometer [9–11]. The methods of image analysis and processing enable to determine the position of inner and outer contours of the cornea when measuring its deformation [12]. It is also possible to separate from the eye response to an air puff: the eyeball reaction, low-frequency (≤100Hz) and high-frequency (>100Hz) corneal reactions [13–18]. The eyeball reaction is dependent on the response of musculi bulbi oculi [15]. The left eye reacts differently in comparison with the right one [16,17]. These reactions are so characteristic that on their basis it is possible to say with almost 100% certainty which eye (left or right) is being examined [18,19]. Extremely low-frequency corneal deformations are primarily three characteristic moments: the time of the first applanation (temporary flattening of the cornea), the maximum corneal deformation, the time of the second applanation [20]. High-frequency corneal reactions (>100Hz), hereinafter referred to as vibrations, and their relationship with diseases of the cornea are currently being addressed by ophthalmologists [1,2]. The connection between vibrations of the cornea (its parameters) with keratoconus and an attempt to classify healthy subjects and patients are presented below.493 eyes of healthy subjects and 279 eyes of patients with keratoconus were used in the measurements. For each eye, I=140 corneal deformation images were recorded during intraocular pressure measurement. Each image was recorded every 230 µs and had a resolution M×N=200×576 pixels, which gave the pixel size of 16.5×15.7µm. Healthy subjects gave informed consent for examinations and in the case of children the consent was obtained from their legal guardians. The examinations of ill patients were from routine medical examinations carried out at the Instituto de Olhos Renato Ambrósio, Rio de Janeiro. All tests were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Healthy subjects and patients ranged in age from 16 to 89 years, 58% of them were women. They had no history of any other type of condition and, above all, any other eye diseases. Diagnosis of keratoconus was made based on placido disk-based axial topography, elevation-derived anterior corneal curvature maps, [21] and according to the criteria used in the collaborative longitudinal evaluation of Keratoconus study [22]. Keratoconus cases with a history of corneal surgery or with extensive corneal scarring were excluded from the study.
