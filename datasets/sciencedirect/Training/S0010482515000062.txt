@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), while still at the stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is important for the development of new treatments. However, brain degeneration in MCI evolves with time and differs from patient to patient, making early diagnosis a very challenging task. Despite these difficulties, many machine learning techniques have already been used for the diagnosis of MCI and for predicting MCI to AD conversion, but the MCI group used in previous works is usually very heterogeneous containing subjects at different stages. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the disease stage impacts on the ability of machine learning methodologies to predict conversion. After identifying the converters and estimating the time of conversion (TC) (using neuropsychological test scores), we devised 5 subgroups of MCI converters (MCI-C) based on their temporal distance to the conversion instant (0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months before conversion). Next, we used the FDG-PET images of these subgroups and trained classifiers to distinguish between the MCI-C at different stages and stable non-converters (MCI-NC). Our results show that MCI to AD conversion can be predicted as early as 24 months prior to conversion and that the discriminative power of the machine learning methods decreases with the increasing temporal distance to the TC, as expected. These findings were consistent for all the tested classifiers. Our results also show that this decrease arises from a reduction in the information contained in the regions used for classification and by a decrease in the stability of the automatic selection procedure.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Alzheimer׳s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of faculties that leads to severe dementia and eventually death [1,2]. No cure has been found yet and thus, the development of therapies that can delay the advance of symptoms has attracted great attention. However, such treatments have the greatest impact when the diagnosis is provided at an early stage.Before the onset of AD, individuals may experience cognitive changes beyond what is expected for their age and education, but that do not interfere significantly with their daily activities. This condition is typically known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI subjects, particularly the amnestic subtype, are at risk of converting to AD, but they can also evolve into a different form of dementia, remain stable or even regress to a normal aging process [3].In order to improve diagnosis and to understand the evolution of AD, a variety of biomarkers have been investigated including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) molecular biomarkers and neuroimaging biomarkers where special attention has been given to two modalities: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). In an attempt to predict and understand the behavior of distinct biomarkers across AD progression, some models have been developed, such as the one proposed by Jack et al. [4]. This model, termed Biomarkers Cascade Model (BMC), considers that biomarker abnormalities and clinical symptoms occur in a sequential way over time. Generally, BMC states that the first stages of AD are characterized by abnormalities in CSF biomarkers, followed by abnormalities in FDG-PET biomarkers as a result of the neuronal dysfunction. Later, with the onset of neuronal degeneration, the MRI abnormalities are recorded and finally, in the later phase of AD, the clinical symptoms are observed. Abnormalities in the FDG-PET biomarkers are expected to be detectable as early as 24 months before AD onset. Additionally, distinct brain areas also display distinct behaviors across the disease evolution [4].Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied to these types of biomarkers, with support vector machine (SVM) being the preferred classifier mainly because of its superiority in terms of generalization ability when it comes to high dimensional problems. SVMs were used, for instance, in [5,6] to classify MR images and in [7–9] to classify FDG-PET images, and also for multimodal classification, i.e. to combine information from different biomarkers. For example, in [10] it was applied to MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and in [11,12] to MRI, CSF and also FDG-PET. Although SVM is the most commonly applied classifier, others have also been successfully used: AdaBoost was applied to PET images in [13], linear discriminant analysis was used with MRI in [14] and random forests also with PET in [12].The number of features initially available is extremely high, and thus a dimensionality reduction step is usually applied to the neuroimaging data before being used for classification. This step not only speeds up the diagnostic system, but can also enhance its diagnostic performance. Techniques that have been investigated for this purpose include (but are not restricted to): principal component analysis (PCA) [15], nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) [9], filter methods based on t-test [11], Pearson correlation [7] or mutual information [7,8] and also wrapper methods such as recursive feature elimination [10,5].In most of the previous studies, the MCI group is very heterogeneous containing subjects at different stages of the disease. In fact, few works have investigated how the disease stage influences the ability of machine learning methodologies to perform diagnosis. Adaszewski et al. [16] used the amount of gray-matter computed from MR images to assess the diagnostic accuracy of an SVM classifier at different moments in time before conversion into AD. This study showed a clear upward trend in the generalization of the diagnostic system as the MCI patients approached the moment of conversion. Eskildsen et al. [17], on the other hand, performed a similar analysis but using the cortical thickness computed from anatomical MR images as features. In this case, the brain was partitioned into several regions of interest (ROI) and only the average thickness in each region was used for diagnosis.In this paper, we will also investigate how the disease stage influences the ability of machine learning methodologies to perform diagnosis but we will focus on FDG-PET images to distinguish MCI subjects that will convert to AD from those that will remain stable. The reason for using FDG-PET in this work relates to the fact that AD like patterns are present in FDG-PET at an earlier stage of the disease when compared with structural neuroimaging [4,18]. By splitting the longitudinal images of the MCI converters based on their temporal distance to the conversion event, we aim to analyze AD progression at different stages, not only in terms of classification performance but also in terms of the classification patterns and of the system stability as measured by the influence of the classification parameters on performance.
