@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The objective of this study was to investigate differences in intima-media thickness (IMT) and diameter (D) measurements of the common carotid artery (CCA) in ultrasound imaging in normal subjects and renal failure disease (RFD) patients. Manual measurements by two experts and automated segmentation measurements (based on snakes and active contour models (ACM)) were carried out on 73 normal subjects, and 80 RFD patients. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at p<0.05. Results demonstrated that the mean IMT and D measurements were significantly higher for the RFD group versus the normal group. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the manual and automated measurements. The ACM segmentation was slightly more accurate than segmentation based on snakes. Further work is needed to validate these findings on a larger group of subjects.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The build-up on the artery walls known as atherosclerosis leads to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and results to heart attack and/or stroke. Atherosclerosis is widely-accepted as the main cause of morbidity and mortality to patients who undergo hemodialysis (HD) with end-stage renal failure disease (RFD) [1–3]. The distance between the lumen-intima and the media-adventitia is known as the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA). It can be determined by measuring the thickness of the innermost two layers of the arterial wall using non-invasive B-mode ultrasound imaging [2]. The IMT is well-accepted as a validated surrogate marker either for the study of atherosclerosis disease or for the study of endothelial dependent function [2].It was shown that RFD patients undergoing HD, compared to the age- and gender-matched normal controls exhibit increased carotid IMT values [3], impaired endothelium dependent, but unimpaired endothelium independent dilatation [4], and a higher risk of coronary artery disease [5]. Moreover, it was documented in [6,7], that the vascular walls of RFD patients are affected by traditional risk factors for increased atherosclerosis, such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. In all of the above studies, the intima-media complex (IMC) was segmented manually by experts. This is a time consuming process [8–11] and automated segmentation is highly desirable, especially when the image database is large [9–11]. Automated segmentation measurements may also reduce the intra- and inter-observer variability [8–11].IMT can be measured through segmentation of the IMC, which corresponds to the intima- and media-layers (see alsoFig. 1) of the arterial CCA wall. A number of techniques for the automated segmentation of the IMC from ultrasound images of the CCA have been proposed in the literature [8]. Recently, in [9,10] we presented a semi-automated IMC segmentation method based on normalization, despeckle filtering and snake-based segmentation which was also used in [9–13]. The system proposed in [10] is an extension of the system in [9] so that the intima- and media-layers of the CCA could also be segmented. A fully automated IMC segmentation algorithm for ultrasound images, based on active contours [14] and active contours without edges [15] (ACM) was presented in [11].A number of studies which investigated the effect of increased IMT in the CCA and its relation to the progression of RFD in HD patients have been performed in the literature. In these studies the segmentations were performed manually by experts. More specifically, in [16], CCA and brachial IMT were evaluated in diabetic and non-diabetic RFD patients undergoing HD. In [5], a correlation between the IMT and age in RFD patients was found, while in [17], kidney dysfunction was associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with mild or moderate chronic RFD. Increased IMT values in chronic RFD patients were also reported in [18], while in [19] it was found that HD pediatric patients had reduced endothelial function with a development of carotid arteriopathy. In [20] it was shown that CCA IMT reflects the risk for ischemic heart disease in HD patients.The objective of this study was to investigate differences in IMT and D measurements of the CCA in ultrasound imaging in normal subjects and RFD patients. Manual measurements by two experts and automated segmentation measurements (based on snakes and ACM) were carried out on 73 normal subjects, and 80 RFD patients. Although the two systems were previously described in [9–13], in this work we expand our methodology to include the measurements of the CCA diameter, D. Furthermore, we have evaluated the system using a new image database not previously available and we report the findings. Our study showed that the IMT and D measurements are larger in RFD patients than in normal individuals. We found significant statistical differences of the IMT and D measurements between the two groups (normal and RFD) but no significant statistical differences between the automated and the manual segmentation measurements. Both segmentation systems had similar performance while the ACM segmentation system produced measurements which were slightly closer to manual delineations made by the experts. The findings of this study may be helpful in understanding the development of RFD and its correlation with atherosclerosis in HD patients.A total of 80 B-mode longitudinal ultrasound images of the CCA from RFD patients, displaying the vascular wall as a regular pattern (see Fig. 1a) that correlates with anatomical layers were recorded (task carried out by co-authors T. Lazarou and M. Pantziaris). The RFD patients, 36 women and 44 men, had a mean±SD age of 63.07±6.82 years (5 patients had CVD symptoms). Additionally, 73 ultrasound B-mode images from healthy individuals, (24 women and 49 men), were acquired, at a mean±SD age of 61.78±11.45 years. The images were acquired using the ATL HDI-5000 ultrasound scanner (Advanced Technology Laboratories, Seattle, USA) [21] with a resolution of 576×768 pixels with 256 gray levels. The spatial gray resolution used for the image acquisitions was 17 pixels per mm (i.e. the resolution is 60µm). The ATL HDI-5000 ultrasound scanner was further equipped with a 256-element fine pitch high-resolution 50-mm linear array, a multi-element ultrasound scan head with an extended operating frequency range of 5–12MHz and it offers real spatial compound imaging. For the recordings, a linear probe (L74) at a recording frequency of 7MHz was used. Assuming a sound velocity propagation of 1550m/s and 1 cycle per pulse, we thus have an effective spatial pulse width of 0.22mm with an axial system resolution of 0.11mm [21]. We use bicubic spline interpolation to resize all images to a standard pixel density of 16.66pixels/mm (with a resulting pixel width of 0.06mm) [22]. A written informed consent from each subject was obtained according to the regulations of the local ethics committee.In order to reduce variability introduced by different gain settings, different operators and different equipment, and improve ultrasound tissue comparability, the ultrasound images were brightness adjusted based on the method described in [22] and [9–13] (see also Fig. 1). Algebraic (linear) scaling of the images were manually performed by linearly adjusting the image so that the range of the median gray level values of the blood was 0–5, and the adventitia (artery wall) was 180–190 [22]. The scale of the gray level of the images ranged from 0 to 255. Thus the brightness of all pixels in the image was readjusted according to the linear scale defined by selecting the two reference regions. Fig. 1a and b presents manual IMC and D segmentations (see also Section 2.3) performed by both experts respectively. Fig. 1c and d illustrates the automated IMC and D segmentations based on snakes [23] and ACM [11]. The segmentations were performed after image normalization and speckle reduction filtering (see also Section 2.4). It is noted that a key point to maintaining a high reproducibility was to ensure that the ultrasound beam was at right angles to the adventitia, which it was visible adjacent to the plaque.A neurovascular expert (co-author M. Pantziaris) and a vascular expert (co-author T. Lazarou) with more than 30 years of clinical experience, manually delineated the IMC and the carotid diameter, D[9–10], on 80 RFD longitudinal ultrasound images of the CCA after image normalization (see Section 2.2) and speckle reduction filtering (see Section 2.4). The first expert also manually delineated the IMC and D on 73 ultrasound images of the CCA acquired from normal subjects. The IMT was measured by selecting 20–30 consecutive points for the intima and the adventitia layers at the far wall of the CCA, while the diameter was measured by selecting 20–30 consecutive points at the near and far walls of the CCA. The manual delineations were made using a system implemented in MATLAB® (Math Works, Natick, MA) by our group. The measurements were performed between 1 and 2cm proximal to the bifurcation of the CCA on the far wall [22], over a distance of 1.5cm starting at a point 0.5cm and ending at a point 2.0cm proximal to the carotid bifurcation. The bifurcation of the CCA was used as a guide, and all measurements were made from that region. The IMT and the diameter, D, were then calculated as the average of all the measurements. The measuring points and delineations were saved to be compared with the two segmentation methods. All sets of manual segmentation measurements were performed by the experts in a blind manner, both with respect to identifying the subject and to delineating the image by using the mouse.The filter DsFlsmv (despeckle filter linear scaling mean variance-DsFlsmv), introduced in [23], and evaluated in [9–13], was applied to image for speckle reduction, prior to the IMC and D segmentations. Filters of this type utilize first order statistics such as the variance and the mean of a pixel neighborhood and may be described with a multiplicative noise model [12,13,23]. Hence, algorithms in this class may generally be described by the following equation:(1)fi,j=g¯+ki,j(gi,j−g¯)wherefi,jis the estimated noise-free pixel value,gi,jis the noisy pixel value in the moving window,g¯is the local mean value of anN1×N2region surrounding and including pixelgi,j,ki,jis a weighting factor, withk∈[0,1], and i, j are the pixel coordinates. The factorki,jis a function of the local statistics in a moving window and is defined [12,13,23] as(2)ki,j=(1−g¯2σ2)(σ2+σn2).The values,σ2andσn2, represent the variance in the moving window and the variance of the noise in the whole video frame respectively. The noise variance may be calculated for the logarithmically compressed image by computing the average noise variance over a number of windows with dimensions considerable larger than the filtering window [12,13,23]. The moving window size for the despeckle filter DsFlsmv was 5×5 and the number of iterations applied to each image was two.Before running the automated segmentation algorithms, IMC and D initialization procedures [9,10,23] were carried out for positioning the initial snake contours as close as possible to the area of interest. The snake initialization procedure is described as follows:1)Load the B-mode image (see Fig. 1a), perform image normalization (see Section 2.2) and despeckle filtering (see Section 2.4). A normalized despeckled image of the CCA is shown in Fig. 1a and b.Binarize the image in order to extract edges more easily.Erode the binary image (from point 2) above by applying an erode morphological operation that eliminates smaller not connected binary image areas.Perform edge detection on the binary eroded image and extract the contour matrix of the image. Extract the contour matrix of the above area by locating points and their coordinates (contours) for the near and far walls of the CCA and construct two interpolating B-splines (adventitia for the near wall and adventitia for the far wall of the CCA). Sample the interpolating B-splines in 30 equal segments, in order to define 30 snake points on each contour.Map the detected near wall and far wall adventitia contour points from point 4) above, on the image to form the initial snake contours for the near and far wall adventitia borders.Displace the initial contour estimated in 4) for the far wall adventitia, upwards for up to 17 pixels (1.02mm) to form the initial snake contour for the intima layer. This displacement is based on the observation that the IMT lies between 0.6 and 1.4mm (0.6mm<IMT<1.4mm), with a mean IMT of 1.0mm [25]. Taking into account that the spatial resolution (distance between 2 pixels) is 0.06mm, then the IMT is lying within the range of 10<IMT<24 pixels, with a mean of 17 pixels. Therefore the displacement of the contour, in order to estimate the intima should be in average 17 pixels.Deform the initial contours by the snake and the ACM (see Section 2.6) to accurately locate the adventitia and intima borders for the far wall and the intima border for the near wall [9,10], as well as measure the CCA diameter [23], and save them.Save and display the detected contours (i.e. far wall adventitia and intima and near wall intima) on the B-mode image (see Fig. 1c and d).The IMC and the D, of the CCA, were automatically segmented after image normalization and despeckle filtering (see Sections 2.2 and 2.4), using two different automated systems developed in MATLAB® by our group and evaluated on 100 ultrasound images as reported in [9–11] respectively. For the first automated system the segmentations were based on the Williams and Shah [26] snake segmentation method, which was used to deform the snake and segment the IMC and the near wall borders in each image. The snake contour,v(s), adapts itself by a dynamic process that minimizes an energy function (Esnake(v,s)) defined as [26](3)Esnake(v(s))=Eint(ν(s))+Eimage(v(s))+Eexternal(v(s))=∫s(αsEcont(v(s))+βsEcurv(v(s))+γsEimage(v(s))+Eexternal(v(s)))ds.whereEint(v(s)),Eimage(v(s)),Eexternal(v(s)),Econt(v(s)), andEcurv(v(s))are the internal, image, external, continuity, and curvature energies of the snake, andαs,βsandγsthe strength, tension and stiffness parameters respectively. For the Williams & Shah method, the strength, tension and stiffness parameters were equal toαs=0.6,βs=0.4, andγs=2respectively [9–12].The second automated system utilizes active contours [14], and active contours without edges [15]. Active contours without edges [15] are used to identify an initial intima-media boundary in each ultrasound image of the CCA and segment the image into lumen and carotid wall. The image is separated into regions based on pixel intensities and uses the following energy functional:(4)F(c1,c2,C)=μ.Length(C)+ν.Area(inside(C))+λ1∫inside(C)|u0(x,y)−c1|2dxdy+λ2∫otside(C)|u0(x,y)−c2|2dxdy.where µ≥0, ν≥0, λ1, λ2>0, are fixed parameters. The segmentation problem becomes the minimization of (4) where all the details about the model and the selection of the parameters are given in [11].The extracted final snake and ACM contours (see Fig. 1c and d), correspond to the adventitia and intima borders of the IMC at the far wall and the intima border at the near wall of the CCA as well as the diameter of the CCA. The distance is computed between the two boundaries (at the far wall), at all points along the arterial wall segment of interest moving perpendicularly between pixel pairs, and then averaged to obtain the mean IMT (IMTmean). Also the maximum (IMTmax, Dmax), minimum (IMTmin, Dmin), and median (IMTmedian, Dmedian) IMT and D values, were calculated. The 80 ultrasound images acquired from the RFD patients as well as the 73 images acquired from normal subjects were automatically segmented using both segmentation techniques proposed in this study.The Wilcoxon rank-sum test [27,28] was used in order to identify if a significant difference (S) or not (NS) exists between the extracted IMC and D segmentation measurements. This was done for each set of measurements (normal subjects versus the RFD subjects) for independent samples of same sizes, for the manual and automated segmentation measurements, with a confidence level of 95%. For significant differences, we require p<0.05. For independent samples of different sizes, the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test [28] was used for detecting significant differences between male and female subjects.Furthermore, box plots for the IMT between the different groups, were plotted. Bland–Altman plots [27], with 95% confidence intervals, were also used to further evaluate the IMT and D segmentation measurements between the normal subjects and the RFD patients. Also, Spearman׳s correlation coefficient, ρ, between the normal and the RFD, IMT and D segmentation measurements, which reflects the extent of a linear relationship between two data sets, was investigated. We furthermore, use regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the IMT and age for the normal and RFD subjects.
