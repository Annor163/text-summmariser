@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The linguistic term set is an applicable and flexible technique in qualitative decision making (QDM). To further develop the linguistic term set, this paper proposes a generalized asymmetric linguistic term set (GALTS) based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics, which belongs to an asymmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set, and can be used to address the QDM problems involving risk appetites of the decision maker (DM). Then, a value-at-risk fitting (VARF) approach is designed for obtaining the risk appetite parameters of the GALTS and six desirable properties of the GALTS are analyzed, i.e., asymmetry, non-uniformity, generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility. Based on the above approaches and the generalized asymmetric linguistic preference relations (GALPRs), a QDM process involving risk appetites of the DM is designed. Because the GALPRs consist of subjective information provided by the DM, the process is not perfectly consistent and is usually difficult to change or repeat. Thus, a transitivity improvement approach is investigated, and the corresponding calculation steps are provided. Finally, an example dealing with the problem of investment decision making is provided, and the results fully demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods for QDM involving risk appetites.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Qualitative decision making (QDM) is an important decision field and can be substituted for quantitative decision making (DM) when data and quantitative information are unavailable. Meanwhile, our daily life is repeated with qualitative information, which could be considered a database of information as it closely resembles human subjective cognition. Therefore, many related QDM theories and methods have been proposed and applied (Brugha, 1998; Sabbadin, Fargier, & Lang, 1998; Ngwenyama & Bryson, 1999; Türkşen, 2002; Paul et al., 2002; Lee & Hurst, 2007; Willow, 2007; Montibeller & Belton, 2009; Wu, Zhang, Wu, & Olson, 2010; Ramey, 2013; Liao, Xu, Zeng, & Merigó, 2015; Cabrerizo, 2015).The complexity of objectives, the fuzziness of human thought, and the uncertainty associated with the qualitative information have led to the proposal of a specific technique allowing computing with words (CWW) by Zadeh (1975, 1996) and its subsequent application to the area of QDM (Rubin, 1998; Herrera & Martinez, 2000; Ying, 2002; Herrera, Alonso, Chiclana, & Herrera-Viedma, 2009; Zadeh, 2012; Yager, 2014; Massanet et al., 2014). Different from general QDM methods, the CWW method processes words and expressions that form the basis of natural or artificial languages and provides a methodology for narrowing the gap between the human brain mechanisms and the machine processes to address imprecision. Thus, the main element of the CWW method is the linguistic variable, which is defined by Zadeh (1975) as a “variable whose values are not numbers but words or sentences in a natural or artificial language.” Therefore, although these linguistic variables are less specific than numerical ones, they more closely capture the notion of human thoughts. For example, the decision makers (DMs) may prefer and consider the linguistic terms such as “good”, “fair”, and “poor” straightforward to evaluate the “comfort” of a house, instead of using numerical values. Generally, the linguistic values of a linguistic variable are collected in the form of a finite term set, referred to as a linguistic term set. As the main component and key technology of the QDM based on the CWW method, the linguistic term sets have been successfully applied in many fields (Wang, Chang, & Wang, 2009; Cabrerizo, Herrera-Viedma, & Pedrycz, 2013; Estrella, Rodriguez, Espinilla, & Martinez, 2014; Wang, Wang, Chen, Zhang, & Chen, 2014a; Pérez-Asurmendi & Chiclana, 2014; Dong & Herrera-Viedma, 2015; Merigó et al., 2015). Furthermore, various linguistic term sets have been proposed, such as the asymmetric and non-uniformly distributed linguistic term set (Torra, 1996; Herrera & Herrera-Viedma, 2000), the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic term set (Herrera & Martínez, 2000; Dong, Xu, & Yu, 2009), the virtual linguistic term set (Xu, 2004a), the uncertain linguistic term set (Xu, 2004b), the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set (Xu, 2004c), the proportional 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic term set (Wang & Hao, 2006), the unbalanced linguistic term set (Herrera-Viedma & López-Herrera, 2007; Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Martinez, 2008), the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (Rodriguez, Martinez, & Herrera, 2012), the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (Wang, Wu, Wang, Zhang, & Chen, 2014b), and the extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (Wang, 2015).Actually, these linguistic term sets can be classified into four basic types, according to their representation forms and linguistic values, including the symmetric and uniform linguistic term set, the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set, the symmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set, and the asymmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set. The first two of these term sets are simple and easy to use; however, in reality, the linguistic variables of linguistic term sets are neither uniformly nor symmetrically distributed (Wang & Hao, 2006; Herrera et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2008, 2009; 2013, 2015). Herrera et al. (2008) addressed this problem by introducing the unbalanced linguistic term set and developed a methodology to process the unbalanced linguistic information. Dong et al. (2009), Dong, Hong, Xu, & Yu, 2011 proposed the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach to select the individual numerical scales and the prioritization methods in Analytic Hierarchy Process. This approach focuses on the numerical scale and the prioritization method, but not on the linguistic term sets. Note that Dong's approach can capture the asymmetry, variability, and non-uniformity by using different individual numerical scales; however, its linguistic term set is the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic term set. Thus, the above approaches do not fully capture some desired properties of the linguistic term sets provided by the DMs, such as generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility. Here, the generalized property refers to the ability of a linguistic term set to depict the above four basic linguistic term sets; the variability indicates that the considered linguistic term set should be variable for different DMs; the range consistency requires the linguistic values of a linguistic term set to be in a constant domain; and the diminishing-utility property reflects the usual law of diminishing marginal utility in economics. Therefore, this paper focuses on the construction of a generalized asymmetric linguistic term set (GALTS) capable of capturing the above-listed six desirable properties, i.e., asymmetry, non-uniformity, generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility. Based on these properties, the proposed decision making method is shown to be more suitable for application to the QDM process involving risk appetites than other QDM methods, and this also demonstrates the applicability of this new method by practitioners in real decision making problems.As mentioned above, the main purpose of this paper is to construct a generalized and asymmetric linguistic term set and to apply it to the QDM involving risk appetites. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: the four basic linguistic term sets and their representations for CWW are analyzed in Section 2. Section 3 proposes the GALTS based on a developed asymmetric semantic form, and then its six desirable properties are demonstrated. Furthermore, the QDM process involving risk appetites based on the generalized asymmetric linguistic preference relations (GALPRs) is constructed and a transitivity improvement approach is designed in Section 4. Then, in Section 5, a numerical example concerning the investment decision making is provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Finally, the conclusions are provided in Section 6.A linguistic term set is defined by a syntactic form and a semantic form, and is distributed on a predefined ordered scale (Yuen, 2012; Rodriguez & Martinez, 2013). Here, the syntactic form is a linguistic descriptor of the verbal words or sentences and can either be selected by an approach based on context-free grammar or an ordered structure (Herrera & Herrera-Viedma, 2000). The semantic form is a mathematical representation and is described by membership functions such as the trapezoidal membership function (Delgado, Vila, & Voxman, 1998) and the triangular membership function (Xu, 2008). In the following text, the four aforementioned basic linguistic term sets are analyzed and compared from the perspective of syntax and semantics.Formally, a general linguistic term set S (known as the symmetric and uniform linguistic term set) with syntax and semantics can be represented as:(1)S={sα|α=0,1,…,τ}whereτ+1is a positive integer and denotes the granularity of the linguistic term set S, and sαsatisfies the following conditions:(1)The set is ordered: si≥ sjiff i ≥ j;The negation operator is defined:neg(sα)=sτ−α.For Eq.(1), Bordogna, Fedrizzi, and Pasi (1997) pointed out thatτ+1should be neither too large nor too small. Ifτ+1is an odd number, then S is usually used to represent a symmetrically distributed term set, based on which Xu (2004b) defined the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set as:(2)S¯={s¯α|α=−t,…,−1,0,1,…,t}where2t+1denotes the granularity ofS¯, the middle linguistic labels¯0represents an assessment of “indifference” or “fair”,s¯−tands¯tare the lower and upper bounds of linguistic labels, where t is a positive integer. The quantitys¯tsatisfies the following conditions:(1)The set is ordered:s¯i≥s¯jiff i ≥ j;The negation operator is redefined as:neg(s¯α)=s¯−αandneg(s¯0)=s¯0.Ift=4, then the subscript-symmetric linguistic term setS¯can be represented as:S¯={s¯−4=extremelypoor,s¯−3=verypoor,s¯−2=poor,s¯−1=slightlypoor,s¯0=fair,s¯1=slightlygood,s¯2=good,s¯3=verygood,s¯4=extremelygood}It is easily found that both the general linguistic term set and the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set are symmetrically and uniformly distributed. Xu (2004b) pointed out that, among these two linguistic term sets, the latter is more logical than the former. Liao, Xu, and Zeng (2014) subsequently provided the semantics of the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set.Next, based on the unbalanced linguistic term set (Herrera-Viedma & López-Herrera, 2007), Xu (2009) provided a simplified unbalanced linguistic term set denoted as follows:(3)S(t)={sα(t)|α=1−t,23(2−t),24(3−t),...,0,...24(t−3),23(t−2),t−1}where t is a positive integer, the middle linguistic labels0(t)represents an assessment of “indifference” or “fair”, ands1−tandst−1are the lower and upper bounds of linguistic labels.sα(t)satisfies the following conditions:(1)The set is ordered:si(t)≥sj(t)iff i ≥ j;The negation operator is redefined as:neg(sα(t))=s−α(t)andneg(s0(t))=s0(t).Ift=5, then a set S(5) of nine unbalanced linguistic terms can be represented as:S(5)={s−4(5)=extremelypoor,s−2(5)=verypoor,s−1(5)=poor,s−2/5(5)=slightlypoor,s−0(5)=fair,s2/5(5)=slightlygood,s1(5)=good,s2(5)=verygood,s4(5)=extremelygood}It can be found that the unbalanced linguistic term set is a symmetrically and non-uniformly distributed linguistic term set.Furthermore, an asymmetrically and non-uniformly distributed linguistic term set was proposed by Torra (1996) and Herrera and Herrera-Viedma (2000). Because the particular sub-domain may be more informative than the remaining sub-domains, this linguistic term set assumes that the density of terms in a sub-domain is greater than that in the other sub-domains of the reference domain. It is noteworthy that, in this situation, the negation function may not involve one-to-one mapping and should be designed according to the semantics of terms in the reference domain. However, the specific form of the asymmetrically and non-uniformly distributed linguistic term set is not provided.Thus, four basic linguistic term sets, which include the general linguistic term set, the subscript- symmetric linguistic term set, the symmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set, and the asymmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set, have been presented. Figs. 1–4demonstrate their differences and properties:Based on Figs. 1–4, the following conclusions are derived: (1) both the general linguistic term set and the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set belong to the category of symmetrical and uniform linguistic term sets, which are two simple linguistic term sets; (2) the unbalanced linguistic term set belongs to the category of symmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term sets; (3) the asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term set is a more generalized linguistic term set; however, its syntax and semantics are still not defined rigorously, which prevents it from being effectively applied to CWW. For this reason, a new asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term set, namely the generalized asymmetric linguistic term set (GALTS), is developed in the next section.As mentioned above, the basic element of a linguistic term set is the semantics. Therefore, in the following, the asymmetric sigmoid semantics is designed first, based on which the GALTS is proposed. Then, the risk appetites and six desirable properties of the GALTS are presented and calculated for theoretically demonstrating the advantages of the GALTS.The semantic form of the linguistic term set is a mathematical representation and is described by a membership function such as the trapezoidal membership function (Delgado et al., 1998) or the triangular membership function (Xu, 2008). Therefore, in what follows, an extended sigmoid function is developed, forming the basis for the definition of an asymmetric semantic form and the development of the GALTS.Definition 1IfRis the set of real numbers, t is a real number, θ1 ≥ 0, and θ2 ≥ 0, then the extended sigmoid function g(t) can be defined as:(4)g(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2t)−1×1{t|t<0}It can be found that the extended sigmoid function g(t) ∈ [0, 1] is asymmetric when θ1 ≠ θ2. Then, an asymmetric semantic form can be defined as follows:Definition 2Let the extended sigmoid function be the mathematical representation of a semantic form, in which case it is defined as the asymmetric sigmoid semantics.Moreover, based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics and the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set (Xu, 2004b), the following asymmetry and non-uniformity GALTS is constructed:Definition 3Let{s−τ,s−τ+1,...,s0,...,sτ−1,sτ}be a finite and subscript-symmetric discrete linguistic term set, andg(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2t)−1×1{t|t<0}be the representation of the asymmetric sigmoid semantics. Then, a GALTS USis defined as:(5)Uτ={<st,ut>|t=−τ,...,0,...,τ;ut=g(t)}In addition, the GALTS satisfies the following conditions:(1)The set is ordered ui≥ uj, iff i ≥ j.u0 represents the assessment of “indifference”, andu0=0.5.For example, lett=4, a GALTSU4of nine linguistic terms can be represented as:U4={<extremelypoor,(1+e4θ2)−1>,<verypoor,(1+e3θ2)−1>,<poor,(1+e2θ2)−1>,<slightlypoor,(1+eθ2)−1>,<fair,0.5>,<slightlygood,(1+e−θ1)−1>,<good,(1+e−2θ1)−1>,<verygood,(1+e−3θ1)−1>,<extremelygood,(1+e−4θ1)−1>}If θ1 ≠ θ2, then it can be found that the GALTSU4is an asymmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set. Of course, if the DM accepts that her/his risk appetites for “good” and “poor” are equal, thenθ1=θ2and the GALTSU4is a symmetric and non-uniform linguistic term set. Thus, the proposed GALTS is a generalized linguistic term set. The above phenomena and properties are illustrated and proven in figures and mathematical equations in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.Definition 3 shows that there are two risk appetite parameters (“good” and “poor”) in the GALTS, namely θ1 and θ2, where θ1 is defined as the profitable risk appetite parameter and θ2 is defined as the loss-causing risk appetite parameter. Additionally,g(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1>0.5andg(t)=(1+e−θ2t)−1<0.5for the “good” linguistic terms and the “poor” linguistic terms, respectively, i.e.,{u1,...,uτ−1,uτ}and{u−τ,...,u−2,u−1}. Then, the GALTS can capture the DM preferences and risk appetites by the asymmetric sigmoid semantics. However, the question becomes deciding how to obtain suitable and accepted risk appetite parameters for the DM. This problem is addressed by designing the following value-at-risk fitting (VARF) approach for calculating θ1 and θ2. This approach is defined as follows:LetUτ={<st,ut>|t=−τ,...,0,...,τ;ut=g(t)}be a GALTS,g(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2t)−1×1{t|t<0}be its semantic form, and let the DM-accepted linguistic term values beV={v(to),v(tp),…,v(tq)}, where, θ1 ≥ 0, θ2 ≥ 0,INdenotes the indicative function, ando,p,…,q∈[−τ,τ]. Then, the VARF approach to calculate the risk appetite parameters includes the following two steps:Step 1. Choose a distance function and construct the optimal constraint as:(6)min{de(θ1,θ2,V)}=min{(|g(tn)−v(tn)|2+|g(tm)−v(tm)|2+⋯+|g(tp)−v(tp)|2)1/2}Step 2. Solve the above nonlinear programming problem and obtain two optimal risk appetite parameters.The Euclidean distance is found to be the basis of Eq. (6), and can also be replaced by the normalized Euclidean distance, the Hamming distance, or the normalized Hamming distance, and the calculation processes are consistent. Next, the following three examples are provided to demonstrate the VARF approach.Example 1Suppose that a GALTS is represented byU3={<st,ut>|t=−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3;ut=g(t)}, its asymmetric sigmoid semantic form isg(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2t)−1×1{t|t<0}, and the DM provides the accepted linguistic term valuesV={v(t−2)=0.1,v(t1)=0.7,v(t2)=0.8}, where the corresponding linguistic terms are {s−2= poor, s1= slightly good, s2=good}. Based on the VARF approach, the risk appetite parametersθ¯1andθ¯2can be calculated, and the asymmetric sigmoid semantic form can be obtained. The calculation processes are as follows:Step 1. Choose the Euclidean distance function and construct the optimal constraint as:(7)min{de(θ1,θ2,V)}=min{(|g(t−2)−v(t−2)|2+|g(t1)−v(t1)|2+|g(t2)−v(t2)|2)1/2}=min{(|(1+e2θ2)−1−0.1|2+|(1+e−θ1)−1−0.7|2+|(1+e−2θ1)−1−0.8|2)1/2}Step 2. Solve this nonlinear programming problem and obtain the two optimal risk appetite parametersθ¯1=0.7447andθ¯2=1.0986.Furthermore, the above seven linguistic terms can be represented by {s−3=very poor,s−2=poor,s−1=slightly poor, s0=fair, s1=slightly good, s2=good, s3= very good}, the corresponding GALTS is denoted asU3={<st,ut>|t=−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3;ut=g(t)}, and its asymmetric sigmoid semantic form isg(t)=(1+e−0.7447t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−1.0986t)−1×1{t|t<0}. Then,g(t−3)=0.0357,g(t−2)=0.1000,g(t−1)=0.2500,g(t0)=0.5,g(t1)=0.6780,g(t2)=0.8160, andg(t3)=0.9033, which are shown in Fig. 5.Based on Example 1 and Fig. 5, the following conclusions can be derived:•By comparing Fig. 5 with Fig. 4, we find that the GALTS belongs to the asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term set, exhibiting the asymmetry and non-uniformity.The GALTS can present the DM risk appetites by using the two risk appetite parameters,θ¯1andθ¯2. In this example, the DM provides his/her accepted linguistic term values, which form the basis for obtaining the specific semantics and the GALTS.The above GALTS also shows that this DM is a risk seeker because the larger values are assigned to profitable risks than lose-causing risks.Example 2Based on Example 1, if the accepted linguistic term values of the DM are symmetric around s0 andV={v(t−2)=0.2,v(t−1)=0.3,v(t1)=0.7,v(t2)=0.8}, based on the VARF approach, the following calculation is provided to obtain the DM risk appetite parameters and the asymmetric sigmoid semantics.Step 1. Choose the Euclidean distance function and construct the optimal constraint as:(8)min{de(θ1,θ2,V)}=min{(|g(t−2)−v(t−2)|2+|g(t−1)−v(t−1)|2+|g(t1)−v(t1)|2+|g(t2)−v(t2)|2)1/2}=min{(|(1+e2θ2)−1−0.2|2+|(1+eθ2)−1−0.3|2+|(1+e−θ1)−1−0.7|2+|(1+e−2θ1)−1−0.8|2)1/2}Step 2. Solve the above nonlinear programming problem and obtain two optimal risk appetite parametersθ¯1=θ¯2=0.7447.Thus,g(t)=(1+e−0.7447t). Then,g(t−3)=0.0967,g(t−2)=0.1840,g(t−1)=0.3220,g(t0)=0.5,g(t1)=0.6780,g(t2)=0.8160, andg(t3)=0.9033. Fig. 6shows the distribution of the GALTS of seven linguistic terms whenθ¯1=θ¯2=0.7447. This demonstrates that the GALTS can effectively fit the symmetrical and non-uniform linguistic terms.Example 3Suppose that a GALTS is represented byU3={<st,ut>|t=−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3;ut=g(t)}, its semantic form isg(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2t)−1×1{t|t<0}, and the DM agrees that the symmetric and uniform linguistic term setV={v(t−3)=0.2,v(t−2)=0.3,v(t−1)=0.4,v(t0)=0.5,v(t1)=0.6,v(t2)=0.7,v(t3)=0.8}contains his/her accepted linguistic term values, where the corresponding linguistic terms are {s−3=very poor,s−2=poor,s−1=slightly poor, s0=fair, s1=slightly good, s2=good, s3= very good}. Based on the VARF approach, the risk appetite parametersθ¯1andθ¯2can be calculated, and the asymmetric sigmoid semantics can be obtained as follows:Step 1. Choose the Euclidean distance function and construct the optimal constraint as:(9)min{de(θ1,θ2,V)}=min{(|(1+e3θ2)−1−0.2|2+|(1+e2θ2)−1−0.3|2+|(1+eθ2)−1−0.4|2+|(1+e−θ1)−1−0.6|2+|(1+e−2θ1)−1−0.7|2+|(1+e−3θ1)−1−0.8|2)1/2}Step 2. Solve this nonlinear programming problem and obtain the two optimal risk appetite parametersθ¯1=θ¯2=0.4413.Thus,g(t)=(1+e−0.4413t)−1. Then,g(t−3)=0.2102,g(t−2)=0.2927,g(t−1)=0.3914,g(t0)=0.5,g(t1)=0.6086,g(t2)=0.7073, andg(t3)=0.7898. Fig. 7shows the distribution of the GALTS of several linguistic terms whenθ¯1=θ¯2=0.4413. This indicates that the above GALTS fits the symmetrical and uniform linguistic term set effectively.Fig. 8shows the fitting results of Examples 1, 2, and 3. The fit errors for these three examples are below 10%, which demonstrates that the VARF approach can be used to effectively fit the linguistic term values provided by a DM, including the asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic terms, the symmetrical and non-uniform linguistic terms, and the symmetrical and uniform linguistic terms. Therefore, the GALTS based on the proposed asymmetric sigmoid semantics is a generalized linguistic term set.As a new and generalized linguistic term set, the GALTS has some desirable properties such as asymmetry, non-uniformity, generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility. The first three properties, including asymmetry, non-uniformity, and generality, are illustrated in Examples 1 to 3. The remaining three properties are presented and proven as follows:Property 4(Variability). LetUτi={<sti,uti>|t=−τ,...,0,...,τ;uti=gi(t)}(i=1,2)be two GALTSs, andgi(t)=(1+e−θ1it)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2it)−1×1{t|t<0}be their asymmetric sigmoid semantic form, whereθ1i≥0,θ2i≥0, andINdenotes the indicative function. Then, the two GALTSs are different whenθ11≠θ12orθ21≠θ22.ProofThis property is obvious. ■Property 4 shows that the GALTS varies for different DMs according to their risk appetites even though the syntactic form and the linguistic variables are invariable. Obviously, this setting is more reasonable than the linguistic term sets with unchanged syntactic and semantic forms.Property 5(Range consistency). LetUτ={<st,ut>|t=−τ,...,0,...,τ;ut=g(t)}be a GALTS andg(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2t)−1×1{t|t<0}be its asymmetric sigmoid semantic form, whereθ1≥0,θ2≥0, andINdenotes the indicative function. Then,ut=g(t)∈[0,1].ProofForg(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2t)−1×1{t|t<0},t=−τ,...,0,...,τ, and τ is a positive integer, then(1)when t ≥ 0,g(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1,min{g(t)}=0.5, andmax{g(t)}=1. Thus,ut=g(t)∈[0.5,1]when t ≥ 0;when t ≤ 0,g(t)=(1+e−θ2t)−1,min{g(t)}=0, andmax{g(t)}=0.5. Thus,ut=g(t)∈[0,0.5]when t ≤ 0.Therefore,ut=g(t)∈[0,1], which completes the proof of this property. ■Then, this GALTS has range consistency, i.e., the range of the linguistic values is constant, which is a useful property. It is more convenient to aggregate the linguistic values with different granularities.Property 6(Diminishing utility property). LetUτ={<st,ut>|t=−τ,...,0,...,τ;ut=g(t)}be a GALTS,U¯τ={u1,...,uτ−1,uτ}andU^τ={u−τ,...,u−2,u−1}be its “good” linguistic terms and “poor” linguistic terms, respectively, andg(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2t)−1×1{t|t<0}be its semantic form, whereθ1≥0,θ2≥0, andINdenotes the indicative function. Then(1)Ifn,m∈U¯τ, n > m, σ > 0,(m+σ),(n+σ)∈U¯τ,Δun=un+σ−un, andΔum=um+σ−um, then Δun< Δum;Ifp,q∈U^τ, |p| > |q|, σ < 0,(p+σ),(q+σ)∈U^τ,Δup=up+σ−up, andΔuq=uq+σ−uq, then Δup< Δuq.ProofAsut=g(t)andg(t)=(1+e−θ1t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−θ2t)−1×1{t|t<0}, then(1) Ifn,m∈U¯τ, n > m, σ > 0,(m+σ),(n+σ)∈U¯τ, thenun+σ=g(n+σ)=(1+e−θ1(n+σ))−1,un=g(n)=(1+e−θ1n)−1um+σ=g(m+σ)=(1+e−θ1(m+σ))−1,um=g(m)=(1+e−θ1m)−1andΔun=un+σ−un=(1+e−θ1n)−(1+e−θ1(n+σ))(1+e−θ1(n+σ))(1+e−θ1n)=1−e−θ1σ(eθ1n+e−θ1σ)(1+eθ1n)Δum=um+σ−um=(1+e−θ1m)−(1+e−θ1(m+σ))(1+e−θ1(m+σ))(1+e−θ1m)=1−e−θ1σ(eθ1m+e−θ1σ)(1+eθ1m)For θ1 ≥ 0, σ > 0, n > m, andn,m∈U¯τ, thene−θ1σ∈[0,1]andeθ1n≥eθ1m. Therefore, Δun< Δum.Similar to the above proof, (2) can be easily obtained, and thus, the proof is completed. ■As a behavior rule, the law of diminishing marginal utility applies in our daily life. Therefore, this rule is suitable to be applied to the linguistic values of a linguistic term set in the QDM process. It is noted that only the unbalanced linguistic term set and the proposed GALTS exhibit this property.With regard to the six properties, the asymmetric sigmoid semantics and the GALTS are suitable for depicting the linguistic terms and for obtaining the qualitative evaluation information.A common and feasible approach to apply the linguistic terms to the QDM process is to construct the preference relations of the corresponding linguistic terms (Herrera-Viedma, Martinez, Mata, & Chiclana, 2005; Xu, 2005; Alonso, Cabrerizo, Chiclana, Herrera, & Herrera-Viedma, 2009; Tan, Wu, & Ma, 2011; Xu, Ma, Tao, & Wang, 2014; Haghighi et al., 2014; Sun & Ma, 2015; Yan & Ma, 2015). Therefore, in this section, the generalized asymmetric linguistic preference relations (GALPRs) are constructed by combining the preference relations and the GALTS, and then apply it into the corresponding QDM process involving the risk appetites of the DM. For this, the GALPRs are first proposed and analyzed as follows:To construct the GALPRs, two preference matrices, namely a generalized asymmetric linguistic preference term (GALPT) matrix and a generalized asymmetric linguistic preference value (GALPV) matrix, are defined as follows:Definition 4LetX=(x1,x2,…,xn)be a set of objectives, andUτ={<st,ut>|t=−τ,...,0,...,τ;ut=g(t)}be a GALTS, then a GALPT matrix is defined asS=[st(i,j)]n×n, where st(i, j) ∈ {st}(t(i,j)=−τ,...,0,...,τ)is a GALPT indicating the preference relation of the alternative xiover xj, with the following conditions:(1)t(i,j)+t(j,i)=0for st(i, j) and st(j, i);t(i,i)=0for st(i, i).Definition 5LetX=(x1,x2,…,xn)be a set of objectives,Uτ={<st,ut>|t=−τ,...,0,...,τ;ut=g(t)}be a GALTS, andS=[st(i,j)]n×nbe a GALPT matrix, then a GALPV matrix is defined asU=[ut(i,j)]n×n(i,j=1,2,…,n), whereut(i,j)=g(t(i,j))is a GALPV for the GALPT st(i, j) based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics.Because the GALPRs are based on subjective information provided by the DM, these relations may not be perfectly consistent, and the lack of consistency may lead to an unreasonable result. Meanwhile, the original generalized asymmetric linguistic preference information provided by the DM is usually difficult to change or to provide again. Thus, to enable the GALPRs to be used for the QDM, in the following, a transitivity improvement approach is provided:From Definitions 4 and 5, it is found that the GALPV matrixU=[ut(i,j)]n×nis the transformation of the GALPT matrixS=[st(i,j)]n×nbased on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics. Therefore, the object of transitivity judgment and improvement isS=[st(i,j)]n×n, and the following additive transitivity should be satisfied:Theorem 1LetS=[st(i,j)]n×nbe the GALPT matrix, wheret(i,j)∈{−τ,...,0,...,τ}represents the subscript of st(i, j), st(i, j)is a GALPT indicating the preference relation of the alternative xi over xj, andi,j=1,2,…,n, thenS=[st(i,j)]n×nsatisfies the additive transitivity if(10)t(i,k)+t(k,j)=t(i,j)ProofBecauset(i,j)∈[−τ,(−τ+1),...,0,...,(τ−1),τ], ifdi,j=(t(i,j)+τ)/2τ, then di, j∈ [0, 1],di,i=0.5and(11)dj,i=t(j,i)+τ2τ=−t(i,j)+τ2τ=1−di,j∈[0,1]Therefore, the corresponding matrixD=[di,j]n×nis a fuzzy preference relation matrix, and its additive transitivity can be generalized to accommodate the preference relation matrixD=[di,j]n×nin terms of(di,k−0.5)+(dk,j−0.5)=(di,j−0.5), for alli,j,k=1,2,…,n.Thus, the subscript-GALPT matrixT=[t(i,j)]n×nsatisfies the additive transitivity with the conditiont(i,k)2τ+t(k,j)2τ=t(i,j)2τ, namelyt(i,k)+t(k,j)=t(i,j). Furthermore, the corresponding GALPT matrixS=[st(i,j)]n×nsatisfies the additive transitivity ift(i,k)+t(k,j)=t(i,j), and the proof is completed.■Because of the original GALPT information provided by the DM is usually difficult to change or to provide again, the following approach is designed to improve the transitivity of the original GALPT information:LetS=[st(i,j)]n×n(i,j=1,2,…,n)be the GALPT matrix andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)be the priority vector of S, wheret(i,j)∈{−τ,(−τ+1),...,0,...,(τ−1),τ}represents the subscript of st(i, j), wi∈ [0, 1], and∑i=1nwi=1, if(12)t(i,j)=2τα(wi−wj),i,j=1,2,…,n,α∈[0,0.5]thent(i,i)=0,t(i,k)+t(k,j)=t(i,j)for anyi,k,j=1,2,…,n. Thus,S=[st(i,j)]n×nis an additive consistent GALPT matrix, and Eq. (10) holds. As a result, the deviation elements are introduced as:(13)fij=t(i,j)−2τα(wi−wj),i,j=1,2,…,nA reasonable priority vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)could be determined so as to minimize F(w), i.e.,(14)F(w)=∑i=1n∑j=1n(fij)2=∑i=1n∑j=1n[t(i,j)−2τα(wi−wj)]2Thus, the optimal priority vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)can be obtained by the following Lagrange function:(15)L(w,ζ)=F(w)+ζ(∑i=1nwi−1)=∑i=1n∑j=1n[t(i,j)−2τα(wi−wj)]2+ζ(∑i=1nwi−1)where ζ is the Lagrange multiplier.Differentiating L(w, ζ) with respect towk(k=1,2,…,n)and ζ, and setting these partial derivatives to zero, then(16)2τ∑i=1n[t(i,k)−t(k,i)−4τα(wi−wk)]+ζ=0Therefore, the following set of equations can be obtained:(17){2τ∑i=1n[t(i,1)−t(1,i)−4τα(wi−w1)]+ζ=02τ∑i=1n[t(i,2)−t(2,i)−4τα(wi−w2)]+ζ=0⋯⋯⋯2τ∑i=1n[t(i,n)−t(1,n)−4τα(wi−wn)]+ζ=0∑i=1nwi−1=0Thus,n+1parameters andn+1equations exist in the above set of equations; hence, the optimal priority vectorw*=(w1*,w2*,…,wn*)is available. Based on this optimal priority vector, the transitivity improvement approach can be further designed as follows:Step (1). Sett*(i,j)=2τα(wi*−wj*), wherei,j=1,2,…,n;Step (2). Construct a virtual GALPT matrixS*=[st*(i,j)]n×n;Step (3). Calculate the corresponding GALPV matrixU*=[ut*(i,j)]n×nbased on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics.It can be found thatS*=[st*(i,j)]n×nandU*=[ut*(i,j)]n×nsatisfy the additive transitivity. They are similar to the above GALPT and GALPV matrices and can be used to substitute forS=[st(i,j)]n×nandU=[ut(i,j)]n×n, which means that they can be used in the QDM process involving risk appetites.To apply the proposed theories and approaches, such as the GALTS, VARF, asymmetric sigmoid semantics, GALPT and GALPV matrices, and transitivity improvement, the following QDM process based on the GALTS with regard to the risk appetites of the DM is established:LetX={x1,x2,…,xn}be a set of n alternatives, andY={y1,y2,…,ym}be a set of m criteria. The DM uses the GALTS to express his/her preference for each pair of objects (xi, xj), based on the criterion yc, and to obtain the GALPT matrixSc=[st(i,j)c]n×n(i,j=1,…,n;c=1,…,m). The DM provides his/her accepted linguistic term valuesV={v(to),v(tp),…,v(tq)}(o,p,…,q∈[−τ,τ])to present his/her individual risk appetites. Then, the optimal alternative which satisfies the DM risk appetites is obtained by applying the following QDM process:Step 1. Use the VARF approach to calculate the DM profitable and lose-causing risk appetite parameters θ1 and θ2, respectively, and obtain the asymmetric sigmoid semantic form g(t).Step 2. Use the transitivity improvement approach to calculate and obtain the virtual GALPT matricesS*c=[st*(i,j)c]n×n(i,j=1,2,…,n;c=1,2,…,m).Step 3. TransformS*c=[st*(i,j)c]n×n(i,j=1,2,…,n;c=1,2,…,m)to the corresponding GALPV matricesU*c=[ut*(i,j)c]n×n(i,j=1,2,…,n;c=1,2,…,m)based on g(t).Step 4. Aggregate all individual GALPV matricesU*c=[ut*(i,j)c]n×n(i,j=1,…,n;c=1,…,m)into the collective GALPV matrixU*=[ut*(i,j)]n×n.Step 5. Aggregate all GALTS preference valuesut*(i,j)(i,j=1,2,…,n)in the ith line ofU*=[ut*(i,j)]n×n, and obtain the overall GALTS preference valuesut*(i)(i=1,2,…,n).Step 6. Rank the alternativesxi(i=1,2,...,n)according tout*(i)(i=1,2,…,n), and then derive the optimal one.Step 7. End.To further illustrate the application of the above-mentioned approaches, an investment decision making example is introduced and analyzed as follows:Example 4An investor desires to place an idle fund on the New Tertiary Board as a long-term risk investment with the aim of obtaining high returns. The New Tertiary Board (i.e., the National Equities Exchange and Quotations) was rebuilt in 2012 as a new stock exchange market in China and as the Growth Enterprises Market board expanded, with the aim of activating the multiple-level capital market and services for small and medium-sized enterprises. Thus, it is obviously characterized by a high-risk and high-return market. This particular investor considers six newly listed companies xi(i=1,2,…,6)on the New Tertiary Board to be very promising. These represent the following six potential businesses: a multinational law company x1, a civilian drone company x2, a new materials company x3, an e-commerce company x4, an immigration consultant industry x5, and an off-shore gas recovery company x6. Furthermore, the investor prefers using three criteria to compare and select the companies, i.e., technical feasibility y1, profitability y2, and team capability y3. However, as the six companies are newly listed, reliable financial data and quantified material about these companies and criteria are limited. Thus, the QDM method based on linguistic preference relations is suitable. Moreover, the QDM method based on the GALTS with risk appetites proposed in this paper could be more reasonable than other methods for this type of investment decision making. Thus, this QDM process presented in Section 4.2 is applied in this example.The investor first provides the information regarding her/his linguistic preferences on xiand xj(i,j=1,2,…,6), as represented by the GALPTst(i,j)c(i,j=1,2,…,6;i≤j;c=1,2,3), which indicates the preferences of the investor over each pair of listed companies (xi, xj) according to the criterion yc. The corresponding GALPT matricesSc=(st(i,j)c)6×6(i,j=1,2,…,6;c=1,2,3)are shown in Table 1. Here, the investor applies a set of nine linguistic terms, i.e., S={s−4=extremely poor (EP),s−3=very poor (VP),s−2=poor (P),s−1=slightly poor (SP), s0=fair (F), s1=slightly good (SG), s2=good (G), s3=very good (VG), s4=extremely good (EG)} to compare the six alternative pairs.To obtain the optimal alternatives, the following steps are carried out:Step 1. If the investor provides the accepted linguistic term values asV={v(t−2)=0.1,v(t1)=0.7,v(t2)=0.8}, which indicates that this investor is a risk seeker, then the following asymmetric sigmoid semantic form g1(t) is obtained by using the VARF approach, and the specific calculations refer to those in Example 1:(18)g1(t)=(1+e−0.7447t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−1.0986t)−1×1{t|t<0}Step 2. Use the transitivity improvement approach to calculate and obtain the following virtual GALPT matricesS*1=[st*(i,j)1]6×6,S*2=[st*(i,j)2]6×6andS*3=[st*(i,j)3]6×6.Step 3. Based ong1(t)=(1+e−0.7447t)−1×1{t|t≥0}+(1+e−1.0986t)−1×1{t|t<0},S*1=[st*(i,j)1]6×6,S*2=[st*(i,j)2]6×6andS*3=[st*(i,j)3]6×6can be transformed into the following GALPV matricesU*1=[ut*(i,j)1]6×6,U*2=[ut*(i,j)2]6×6, andU*3=[ut*(i,j)3]6×6.S*1=[s0.00001,s3.16681,s3.83361,s2.33361,s1.16681,s2.50041s−3.16681,s0.00001,s0.66681,s−0.83321,s−2.00001,s−0.66641s−3.83361,s−0.66681,s0.00001,s−1.50001,s−2.66681,s−1.33321s−2.33361,s0.83321,s1.50001,s0.00001,s−1.16681,s0.16681s−1.16681,s2.00001,s2.66681,s1.16681,s0.00001,s1.33361s−2.50041,s0.66641,s1.33321,s−0.16681,s−1.33361,s0.00001],U*1=[0.5000,0.9136,0.9456,0.8504,0.7045,0.86550.0299,0.5000,0.6217,0.2859,0.1000,0.32470.0146,0.3246,0.5000,0.1614,0.0507,0.18780.0715,0.6503,0.7534,0.5000,0.2172,0.53100.2172,0.8160,0.8793,0.7045,0.5000,0.72970.0603,0.6216,0.7296,0.4543,0.1877,0.5000]S*2=[s0.00002,s−4.00002,s−3.00002,s−1.66682,s−0.66682,s−0.66682s4.00002,s0.00002,s1.00002,s2.33322,s3.33322,s3.33322s3.00002,s−1.00002,s0.00002,s1.33322,s2.33322,s2.33322s1.66682,s−2.33322,s−1.33322,s0.00002,s1.00002,s1.00002s0.66682,s−3.33322,s−2.33322,s−1.00002,s0.00002,s0.00002s0.66682,s−3.33322,s2.33322,s−1.00002,s0.00002,s0.00002],U*2=[0.5000,0.0122,0.0357,0.1381,0.3246,0.32460.9516,0.5000,0.6780,0.8504,0.9229,0.92290.9033,0.2500,0.5000,0.7296,0.8504,0.85040.7758,0.0715,0.1878,0.5000,0.6780,0.67800.6217,0.0250,0.0715,0.2500,0.5000,0.50000.6217,0.0250,0.0715,0.2500,0.5000,0.5000]S*3=[s0.00003,s2.16653,s−0.41683,s−0.58363,s1.50003,s−1.66683s−2.16653,s0.00003,s−2.58333,s−2.75013,s−0.66653,s−3.83333s0.41683,s2.58333,s0.00003,s−0.16683,s1.91683,s−1.2503s0.58363,s2.75013,s0.16683,s0.00003,s2.08363,s−1.08323s−1.50003,s0.66653,s−1.91683,s−2.08363,s0.00003,s−3.16683s1.66683,s3.83333,s1.2503,s1.08323,s3.16683,s0.00003],U*3=[0.5000,0.8339,0.3875,0.3450,0.7534,0.13810.0847,0.5000,0.0553,0.0465,0.3247,0.01460.5770,0.8726,0.5000,0.4543,0.8065,0.20210.6070,0.8857,0.5310,0.5000,0.8252,0.23330.1614,0.6216,0.1085,0.0920,0.5000,0.02990.7758,0.9456,0.7173,0.6914,0.9136,0.5000]Step 4.

However, if the investor is risk neutral and considers the symmetric and uniform linguistic term set to be suitable, namely,V={v(t−3)=0.2,v(t−2)=0.3,v(t−1)=0.4,v(t0)=0.5,v(t1)=0.6,v(t2)=0.7,v(t3)=0.8}, then the following steps are provided to derive the optimal alternative.Step 1○.

Therefore, to further analyze the different results for the DMs with different risk appetites and demonstrate the necessity of introducing the GALTS, the following calculations and comparisons are given:Firstly, based on the asymmetric linguistic semantics and the GALPVs, the DMs can be classified according to nine risk profiles, including the strong risk seeker (SRS), the strong income-risk seeker (SIS), the general risk seeker (GRS), the general income-risk seeker (GIS), the risk neutral (RN), the general cost-risk averter (GCA), the general risk averter (GRA), the strong cost-risk averter (SCA), and the strong risk averter (SRA). These nine types of DMs and their corresponding asymmetric linguistic semantics are illustrated in Figs. 9–17according to the first five columns of Table 2. Note that the risk appetite parameters of these DMs are set based on the distribution of the extended sigmoid function. Secondly, by using the same calculations as in Example 4, the optimal alternatives can be obtained for the DMs with different risk appetites, and the results are listed in Table 2.From Example 4, Figs. 9–17, and Table 2, the following conclusions are derived:(1)The results are inconsistent for the DMs with different risk appetites. For SRS, SIS, GIS, GCA, GRA, SCA, and SRA, the optimal alternative is x4. However, for GRS and RN, the optimal alternative is x1. Actually, for GRS, GIS, RN, and GCA, the alternatives x1 and x4 are approximate, because their differences are less than 0.025; thus, both of these alternatives can be taken as their optimal alternatives. Therefore, the DM appetite for risk critically affects the process of decision making in terms of risk, and the proposed GALTS is a suitable approach for the QDM process involving risk appetites of the DM.The GALTS based on the asymmetric sigmoid semantics can effectively depict a variety of DMs with different risk appetites, which is illustrated in Figs. 9–17. These figures indicate that the linguistic values of a risk seeker are larger than those of a risk neutral DM, but the reverse is true for a risk averter. Moreover, the risk seekers and the risk averters can be classified according to their risk appetite parameters. Thus, if the VARF approach proposed above is unavailable, then the DM can provide his/her subjective risk preferences and obtain the corresponding risk appetite parameters based on Figs. 9–17 and Table 2.By comparing the virtual GALPT matricesS*c=[st*(i,j)c]6×6(i,j=1,2,3,4,5,6;c=1,2,3)with the original linguistic terms in Table 1, it is clear that some linguistic terms are changed by the transitivity improvement approach. This means that the accepted linguistic terms provided by the DMs are changed to ensure consistency. Therefore, if the original linguistic information provided by the DMs remains unchanged and is only provided once, the transitivity improvement is requisite and effective; otherwise, it is suggested that the original linguistic information should be obtained again from the DMs until the consistency is satisfied.The six desirable properties of the GALTS are fully demonstrated in Figs 9-17 and Table 2. Meanwhile, the GALTS is capable of providing the optimal alternative according to the risk appetites of different DMs.Based on the above calculations, the GALTS is more rational than the other linguistic term sets, and is more suitable for describing the QDM process involving risk appetites than other similar approaches, including Dong's approach. This study also demonstrates three advantages of the proposed approach, namely, capturing the six desirable properties, accounting for the DM risk appetites, and the suitability for the QDM process involving risk appetites.The QDM approach based on the linguistic term set is an intuitional and applicable method and has been used in many fields. Because of this, various linguistic term sets have been proposed to develop this QDM approach, such as the general linguistic term set, the subscript-symmetric linguistic term set, the unbalanced linguistic term set, and the asymmetrically and non-uniform linguistic term set. To further develop the linguistic term set, in this paper, the GALTS has been proposed which is a generalized linguistic term set and a specific asymmetrical and non-uniform linguistic term set. Then, six desirable properties of the GALTS, i.e., asymmetry, non-uniformity, generality, variability, range consistency, and diminishing-utility, are proved. An obvious advantage of the proposed GALTS is its accounting for the DM's risk appetites. Thus, the QDM process based on the GALTSs is more suitable for application to the qualitative risk-preference decision making than other QDM approaches. This leads us to propose the asymmetric sigmoid semantics based on the extended sigmoid function followed by designing the VARF method to obtain the risk appetite parameters of the DM.However, the linguistic term preference information provided by the DM is usually inconsistent. This problem has been addressed by proposing the transitivity improvement approach, which can be used to improve the consistency of the GALPT preference relations provided by the DM, and thus, the partial linguistic terms provided by the DMs could be changed to ensure consistency. Therefore, if the original linguistic information remains unchanged and is only provided once, then the transitivity improvement is requisite; otherwise, it is suggested that the original linguistic information will be re-obtained from the DMs until the consistency is satisfied.Next, the modeling process for the QDM involving the risk appetites based on the proposed GALTSs has been provided, after which it has been applied to an investment decision making example to further demonstrate its feasibility. This result demonstrates that the proposed method of decision making can be suitably applied to model the QDM process involving risk appetites of the DMs.Admittedly, the proposed QDM process involving risk appetites is curbed by certain limitations; i.e., the values of the risk appetite parameters θ1 and θ2 of the GALTS are uncertain. Even though the VARF approach is designed for obtaining these parameters in this paper, the solutions depend on the accepted linguistic term values provided by DMs and are difficult to verify. Thus, in future work, it would be interesting to determine whether a better algorithm exists for obtaining the risk appetite parameters in the GALTS and the corresponding QDM process.
