@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this study, gene expression programming (GEP) is employed as a new method for estimating the side weir discharge coefficient. The accuracy of existing equations in evaluating the side weir discharge coefficient is first examined. Afterward, taking into consideration the dimensionless parameters that affect the estimation of this parameter and sensitivity analysis, five different models are presented. Coefficient determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute relative error (MARE), scatter index (SI) and BIAS are used for measuring the models’ performance. Two sets of experimental data are applied to evaluate the models. According to the results obtained indicate that the model with Froude number (F1), dimensionless weir length (b/B), ratio of weir length to depth of upstream flow (b/y1), and ratio of weir height to its length (p/y1) parameters of R2=0.947, MARE=0.05, RMSE=0.037, BIAS=0.01 and SI=0.067, performed the best. Accordingly, this new equation proposed through GEP can be utilized for estimating the discharge coefficient in rectangular sharp-crested side weirs.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Side weirs are used for regulating the extra flow within urban wastewater collection networks, drainage-irrigation systems, flood protection and environmental preservation projects. A side weir is commonly installed on the side of a main channel. The flow passing over a side weir is considered a spatially varied flow with decreasing discharge. Numerous analytical, theoretical and experimental research works have been conducted by different researchers on the hydraulic behavior of channels with side weirs. De Marchi [1] solved the equations governing the spatially varied flow in a rectangular channel with a side weir and presented an equation for calculating discharge per unit side weir length.Researchers including Subramanya and Awasthy [2], Yu-Tech [3], Nandesamoorthy and Thomson [4], El-Khashab [5], Ranga Raju et al. [6], Hager [7], Cheong [8], Singh et al. [9], Swamee et al. [10], Jalili and Borghei [11], and Ghodsian [12] have worked in this area. In an experimentally study, Borghei et al. [13] formulated an equation to calculate the discharge coefficient of the flow passing over a rectangular side weir. Their discharge coefficient equation was presented as a function of the side weir's upstream Froude number. The flow passing through a side weir within a rectangular channel was studied experimentally by Ghodsian [14], who calculated the preliminary discharge coefficient for a supercritical flow regime in the main channel along a side weir. Yüksel [15] examined the effect of the specific energy variation on a lateral weir in a rectangular conduit. Khorchani and Blanpain [16], Ramamurthy et al. [17], Huagao et al. [18], Venutelli [19], Vatankhah and Bijankhan [20], Emiroglu et al. [21,22] and Castro-Orgaz and Hager [23] formulated different equations for calculating the side weir discharge coefficient. They obtained the side weir discharge coefficient as a function of the ratio of the head above the weir to the side weir's sill height and Froude number. Bagheri et al. [24] conducted an empirical study on the features of flow passing over a rectangular sharp-crested side weir on the side of a rectangular channel. They analyzed the laboratory results using the artificial neural network and found that the side weir's upstream Froude number is the most effective parameter affecting the discharge coefficient of a rectangular sharp-crested side weir. Emiroglu et al. [25] determined the discharge characteristics of a trapezoidal labyrinth side weir with one and two cycles in subcritical flow regime.Soft computing, a powerful tool in modeling and solving complex nonlinear problems in different fields such as hydraulic engineering [26,27], river engineering [28], and sediment transport [29,30], has come to the attention of a number of researchers in recent years. By using neural networks and neuro-fuzzy technique, Kisi [31] estimated daily suspended sediment load. For flood prediction, Feng and Lu [32] used an artificial neural network model. Emiroglu et al. [21] estimated the discharge coefficient and flow capacity of triangular labyrinth side weirs located on a rectangular channel using the adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). They also presented an equation for calculating the discharge coefficient in this type of side weir. Bateni et al. [33] predicted aquifer hydraulic parameters using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) methods. By employing different neural network techniques such as Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) and Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBNN), Bilhan et al. [34] predicted the discharge coefficient and flow capacity in a rectangular sharp-crested side weir located on the side of a straight channel. Emiroglu et al. [35] used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to estimate the discharge coefficient of a triangular labyrinth side weir on the side of a rectangular channel under subcritical flow regime. Kisi et al. [36] estimated the features of the flow passing from the side weir of a triangular labyrinth using Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBNN) and Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN) algorithms and GEP. Dursun et al. [37] obtained an equation for calculating the discharge coefficient in semi-elliptical side weirs located on a rectangular channel in subcritical flow condition using ANFIS modeling.Recently, the GEP method has been applied to recognize the manner of nonlinear systems such as multisite land-use allocation [38], sediment transport in sewer pipe systems [39], fatigue modeling of composite materials [40], stage-discharge curve [41], fault diagnosis of centrifugal pumps [42], real parameter optimization [43] and the prediction of faulty modules [44].In the present study, the discharge coefficient of a rectangular side weir is simulated using the GEP method. Modeling was done using two different datasets. Five different equations were presented with various input combinations in order to find the most appropriate combination for modeling rectangular sharp-crested side weirs located on the side of a straight rectangular channel in subcritical flow condition. Finally, the most appropriate GEP equation was compared with the equations reported in earlier studies.The GEP method, an extension of genetic programing (GP), is an evolutionary artificial intelligence technique introduced by Ferreira [45]. GEP evolves computer programs with different shapes and lengths encoded in linear chromosomes with fixed size. Subsequently, the chromosomes’ information is decoded into expression Trees – a process called translation. The encoding process is very straightforward, whereby the ET reads the chromosomes from left to right and from top to bottom. An example of chromosome translation to ET is presented in Fig. 1. Each gene starts in the first position. However, the termination point is not always the last gene position and Open Reading Frames (ORF) are used. ORFs were explained in detail by Ferreira [45].ETs are complex computer programs that are commonly evolved for the purpose of solving a particular problem, and they are selected based on their being fit to resolve the problem. Varied genetic alterations discover the characteristics of the existing population and as a result it is fitted to the particular problem that was meant to be solved. This means there is a suitable solution to solve the intended problem provided there is sufficient time and accurate particulars [46,47].According to Fig. 2, the GEP procedure comprises some major steps. At the beginning, chromosomes from the initial population are generated randomly. Then the chromosomes are expressed and according to the considered fitness function, the cost of each chromosome is evaluated. The chromosomes are then selected keeping in view their cost to be produced again or to be modified. Providing new individuals through a similar process including genome expression, conformation of the environmental selection, and reproduction with modification comprises the next step. The mentioned process is repeated until the considered number of generations or acceptable model error is reached [48].The chromosomes in each generation are optimized by genetic operators. The genetic operators applied in the GEP method are mutation, inversion, Insertion Sequence (IS) transposition, crossover, and gene transposition. Mutation can occur anywhere in the chromosome. In the chromosome's head, each character could be replaced by functions or terminals. However, in the chromosome's tail the terminals are only allowed to be replaced with other terminals. Despite the mutation, inversion is only done in the chromosome's head. In the inversion process, a sequence is selected randomly and inverted. The insertion sequence (IS) transposition chooses a random sequence from a chromosome and copies it to any position of the chromosome's head despite the start position. In crossover, the parent chromosomes are combined with each other and two new children are produced. In gene transposition, an entire gene performs as a transposon and transposes itself to the chromosome's start position. After that, in order to prevent chromosome length change, the transposon gene is deleted from the original position. Modeling a GEP for each special problem requires five steps as presented in Section 5 in detail.The data sets presented by Emiroglu et al. [22] and Bagheri et al. [24] were used in this study. Emiroglu et al. [22] conducted their experiments in the hydraulics laboratory at Firat University, Elazig, Turkey. In the experiment they used a 12m long rectangular channel with width, depth and slope of 0.5m, 0.5m and 0.01 respectively. The main channel consisted of a smooth, horizontal, well-painted steel bed and glass lateral walls. A sluice gate was placed at the end of the main channel to control the depth of flow. A discharge collection channel was installed parallel to the main channel and had 0.7m depth and 0.5m width. The collection channel was made for the purpose of providing a circular free-surface condition in a circular shape to facilitate a free overflow condition. A Mitutoyo digital point gauge with ±0.01mm sensitivity was installed 0.4m away from the weir. The side weir was made of steel plates and the crests were completely sharp, aerated and installed at the same level as the side of the main channel. The water was controlled by a pipe and a sluice gate. In Emiroglu et al.’s [24] research, a discharge amount between 0.01 and 0.150m3/s was measured with an electromagnetic flow meter (±0.01L/s sensitivity). Additionally, the discharge results from the electromagnetic flow meter were calibrated using a V-notched weir located at the beginning of the system. The discharge passing through the side weir was also calibrated using a standard rectangular weir installed downstream of the discharge collection channel.Bagheri et al. [24] conducted experiments on rectangular sharp-crested weirs with different heights and widths within a horizontal rectangular channel 8m long, 0.4m wide, and 0.6m deep. All experiments were carried out under subcritical flow condition. The free surface profiles were measured along the side weir's sill and along the channel's central axis using a point meter installed on a mobile carriage with ±0.5mm accuracy. The upstream discharge (Q1) was measured with a ±0.5% accuracy electromagnetic flow meter. The depth of flow and downstream discharge were controlled by a sluice gate that had been previously calibrated; the maximum amount of weir calibration error was approximately ±5%. The flow diverted from the weirs was calculated based on the difference between the upstream and downstream discharge. The data range employed in this study is presented in Table 1.
