@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We study the 3D reconstruction of an isometric surface from point correspondences between a template and a single input image. The template shows the surface flat and fronto-parallel. We propose three new methods. The first two use a convex relaxation of isometry to inextensibility. They are formulated as Second Order Cone Programs (SOCP). The first proposed method is point-wise (it reconstructs only the input point correspondences) while the second proposed method uses a smooth and continuous surface model, based on Free-Form Deformations (FFD). The third proposed method uses the ‘true’ nonconvex isometric constraint and the same continuous surface model. It is formulated with Nonlinear Least-Squares and can thus be solved with the efficient Levenberg–Marquardt minimization method. The proposed approaches may be combined in a single pipeline whereby one of the convex approximations is used to initialize the nonconvex method. Our contributions solve two important limitations of current state of the art: our convex methods are the first ones to handle noise in both the template and image points, and our nonconvex method is the first one to use ‘true’ isometric constraints. Our experimental results on simulated and real data show that our convex point-wise method and our nonconvex method outperform respectively current initialization and refinement methods in 3D reconstructed surface accuracy.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Monocular 3D surface reconstruction of deformable objects is a challenging problem which has gained interest over the past decade. Without additional priors, this is an ill-posed problem since there is an infinite number of deformable 3D surfaces with exactly the same projection. In this paper, we study monocular 3D reconstruction of deformable but isometric surfaces from a single input image and under two common assumptions [21,26,17]. First, we assume that point correspondences are available between the input image and a template image; the latter shows the surface flat and fronto-parallel. Second, we assume that the camera follows the pin-hole model with known intrinsic parameters [13]. This type of reconstruction algorithms may be used for thin-shell objects which may be physically flattened and which smoothly deform without stretching. Examples of such objects and deformations are a sheet of paper being gently bent, a flag waving in the wind and a piece of cloth on a moving body. However, non-physically flattening objects such as faces, even if they deform quasi-isometrically, cannot be handled by this type of algorithms.Different types of constraints have been proposed to disambiguate the problem of monocular 3D reconstruction of deformable surfaces. These constraints can be divided into two main categories: statistical constraints and physical constraints. Constraints coming from both categories may of course be combined [1,7]. Statistical constraints include the very popular low-rank shape model applicable to template-free 3D reconstruction and leading to nonrigid factorization [4,1,3,7,15,27,28]. This constraint has been used in the template-based case by a priori learning a typical shape basis [10,22,24,21]. Physical constraints include temporal and spatial 3D surface priors [12,19] and isometric deformations [23,26,21,17].Methods for monocular 3D reconstruction of deformable surfaces can be categorized by type of constraints but also by type of 3D surface model. The point-wise surface model uses a sparse set of 3D points, each of which generally associated to a known point correspondence [17]. The mesh-based surface model uses a set of connected, typically triangular facets [23,21]. The continuous surface model uses a smooth surface embedding which maps the template space to 3D [17,1].The isometric deformation constraint is widely applicable and stable for 3D reconstruction. For instance, it approximates well the deformation of materials such as paper and fabric [17,21,23,26]. An isometric deformation preserves geodesic distances on the 3D surface across time. However, computing geodesics is a hard problem; it is consequently even harder to constrain their length in a 3D reconstruction algorithm. Two main ways have been proposed to implement the isometry constraint. The first way is the inextensibility relaxation that leads to convex inequality constraints on the 3D points’ coordinates. It upper bounds the Euclidean distance by the template geodesic distance for pairs of 3D points [23,21,26,17]. The second way is the Euclidean approximation that leads to quartic constraints on the 3D points’ coordinates. It preserves the Euclidean distance instead of the geodesic distance for pairs of closely spaced 3D points [25].This paper proposes three new methods to improve template-based 3D reconstruction with the isometric deformation constraint. It extends our conference paper [6].First, the current literature misses a convex algorithm solving the inextensibility relaxation and handling noise in both the template and the input image. We show that the maximum depth heuristic [17] with the inextensibility relaxation can be cast as an SOCP [2]. While previous work use iterative local optimization and model noise in the template image only [17] or in the input image only [23,21,26], our formulation models noise in both images. Our first implementation of this formulation uses a point-wise surface model; our second implementation uses a continuous surface model. In the latter case, we propose using an FFD with a compact B-spline kernel as opposed to the dense TPS kernel [17,1].Second, the current literature misses a formulation of the isometric deformation constraint adapted to nonconvex optimization. We show that using a continuous surface model allows one to gracefully formulate the isometric deformation constraint as a Nonlinear Least-Squares cost function on the unknown continuous surface model.We report extensive experimental results on simulated and real data. They show that our point-wise convex inextensibility method outperforms current initialization methods in terms of 3D reconstruction accuracy, but that directly including the continuous surface model degrades accuracy. Our nonconvex isometric method gives the most accurate results of all compared methods by a substantial margin. We give a careful analysis of these results and draw general conclusions.We review related work in Section 2. We present our embedding-based continuous surface modeling in Section 3. We give our convex methods using inextensibility in Section 4 and our nonconvex method in Section 5.
