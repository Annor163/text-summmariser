Allergic Rhinitis is a symptomatic disorder of the nose due to allergen exposure.A clinical decision support system (CDSS) for diagnosis of Rhinitis is proposed.Skin test results of 872 patients were obtained from an allergy testing centre.The clinical relevance of the CDSS was validated and compared with existing methods.In expert׳s absence, the system assists junior clinicians in decision making.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Backgrounds and objectivesAllergic Rhinitis is a universal common disease, especially in populated cities and urban areas. Diagnosis and treatment of Allergic Rhinitis will improve the quality of life of allergic patients. Though skin tests remain the gold standard test for diagnosis of allergic disorders, clinical experts are required for accurate interpretation of test outcomes. This work presents a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to assist junior clinicians in the diagnosis of Allergic Rhinitis.MethodsIntradermal Skin tests were performed on patients who had plausible allergic symptoms. Based on patient׳s history, 40 clinically relevant allergens were tested. 872 patients who had allergic symptoms were considered for this study. The rule based classification approach and the clinical test results were used to develop and validate the CDSS. Clinical relevance of the CDSS was compared with the Score for Allergic Rhinitis (SFAR). Tests were conducted for junior clinicians to assess their diagnostic capability in the absence of an expert.ResultsThe class based Association rule generation approach provides a concise set of rules that is further validated by clinical experts. The interpretations of the experts are considered as the gold standard. The CDSS diagnoses the presence or absence of rhinitis with an accuracy of 88.31%. The allergy specialist and the junior clinicians prefer the rule based approach for its comprehendible knowledge model.ConclusionThe Clinical Decision Support Systems with rule based classification approach assists junior doctors and clinicians in the diagnosis of Allergic Rhinitis to make reliable decisions based on the reports of intradermal skin tests.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Allergic diseases are the consequences of symptoms that occur due to an interaction between the environment and an individual׳s immune system, resulting in the discharge of histamine and other pro-inflammatory mediators. Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is a symptomatic disorder of the nose, induced after allergen exposure by an immunoglobulin E-mediated inflammation of the membranes lining the nose. It is characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, itching of nose and postnasal drainage [1]. Patients with Allergic Rhinitis may have nasal symptoms that affect their quality of life and their day-to-day activities [2]. A survey conducted in India by Kumar et al. reported that Allergic Rhinitis was prevalent in 26.1% of school children. When considered with the socio-economic status, 27.1% of the lower class people, 33.3% of the middle class people, and 28.6% of upper class people living in urban areas were observed to have respiratory allergic diseases [3]. The characteristic symptoms of rhinitis were observed in 75% of children and 80% of asthmatic adults in India [4]. About 63.7% individuals affected with Allergic Rhinitis coexist with sinusitis. AR adds up to nearly 55% of all allergies present in India [5]. Furthermore there is very little research work conducted in the study of allergies and Allergic Rhinitis when compared to other areas in the medical domain. Literature and research, regarding the clinical features and symptoms of the patients with Allergic Rhinitis in India, is not exhaustive. Allergic diseases have not received the attention it deserves by both patients as well as clinicians [6].Allergic diseases certainly require a unique gold standard test for detection and diagnosis. Works in literature use different tests for reporting an allergic disease. Gold standard tests that use only history findings of patients and physical examination are less sensitive and specific than those that incorporate specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing. The gold standard using a composite of the history, examination, food habits and specific IgE testing is the most commonly used method, but the methods of combining results has variations. Hence an appropriate method of assessment is necessary to assist clinicians in decision-making.There are three gold standard tests which are used to diagnose Allergic Rhinitis, namely, Clinical criteria test, Composite test and Challenge test [7]. Clinical criteria gold standard test depends on the correlation between the patient׳s symptoms with clinical criteria set by expert opinion. Composite gold standard test use a combination of skin prick tests (SPT), in-vitro tests and nasal provocation tests. In challenge gold standard tests, the nasal passages are exposed directly to an allergen in increasing concentrations.Diagnosis of Rhinitis requires a careful history analysis, well-targeted testing for allergic sensitization and physical examination. A prior knowledge about the aerobiology of the region in which the patient lives and patterns of allergen exposure is essential. Skin testing of a specific IgE is not easily accessible and cannot be interpreted precisely by primary care physicians in underserved areas [8]. Quality control measures and proper performance of skin testing are very important to produce correct results. Timely identification of allergens is vital as it may reduce the manifestation of symptoms. Allergens may vary depending on the age, potential allergen exposures, food habits and area of the country. Prick/puncture technique (percutaneous) or intradermal (intracutaneous) technique can be used for skin tests. Intradermal testing is more sensitive than prick/puncture testing [9]. To properly understand and interpret skin tests for specific IgE, it is essential to know which aeroallergens are present locally, are clinically important and have allergenic cross-reactivity with botanically related species [10]. Another limitation of SPT is that definitions of positive results of skin tests may vary from one physician to another. There are chances for inconsistent diagnosis. For example, many skin test studies compare the diameters of the wheals generated by allergens with the diameter of the wheal generated by the histamine control solution to classify test results as positive. Relatively unbiased test performance characteristics may enable junior clinicians to come out with confident decisions and suggestions. [7].Though several methods exist for diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases, a complete resolution of symptoms cannot be obtained. Computer-based predictive models are rarely used in diagnosis of allergic diseases [11]. Due to lack of independent unbiased allergy testing methods, this work proposes a computer-aided approach to assist clinicians in diagnosis and decision-making process. The development in computing and technology, has led to the use of Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) in medical centres and hospitals for efficient and reliable diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore CDSS are used for Dental education [12], Ventilator treatment [13], Cancer Diagnosis [14], Cancer Treatment [15], Diagnosis of heart diseases [16] and Heart Failure [17], Diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders [18] Respiratory pattern analysis [19] and many more. The CDSS in this work uses a rule based knowledge mining approach, for detection of Allergic Rhinitis from the results of the Intradermal Skin Tests.The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the works in literature related to this work. Section 3 presents the framework of the Clinical Decision Support System along with the needed background definitions and notations. Section 4 provides information about the materials, dataset and the methods used in the experiment. Section 5 discusses the results followed by the conclusion and scope for future work.
