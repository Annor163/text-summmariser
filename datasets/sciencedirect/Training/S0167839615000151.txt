@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Reparameterization, i.e. change of coordinates, is a key concept underlying bothGkconstructions of curves and surfaces and isogeometric analysis  of physical properties.Gkcontinuity characterizes constructions ofCksurfaces such that any two abutting pieces have their derivatives match up to order k after reparameterization (see e.g. Gregory and Hahn, 1987; Boehm, 1988; Peters, 2002). Isogeometric elements are higher-order isoparametric elements of classical engineering analysis (Irons and Zienkiewic, 1968): linear combinations of isogeometric elements serve to approximately compute the solution of a differential equation over bounded, often geometrically non-trivial, regions. The term isogeometric was coined in Hughes et al. (2005) to highlight the case when the region is traced out by (shape) functions drawn from the same space as the problem unknowns (analysis functions, a.k.a. displacement functions). The space is typically spanned by tensor-product splines defined on rectangular domains (de Boor, 2002).Until (Nguyen et al., 2014), the isogeometric approach has not been investigated near points where more or fewer than four tensor-product elements meet smoothly. (Such points are called irregular, extraordinary or star points.) Earlier work, for example (Wang et al., 2012), has the isogeometric elements join onlyC0along rays emanating from irregular points. Since the smooth joining of surface pieces at irregular points is governed byGkrelations, it is natural to apply the concept of geometric continuity to constructing everywhere differentiable isogeometric elements. This paper shows that when both the region's parameterization and the analysis functions are drawn from the same space ofGkcontinuous maps then the resulting isogeometric elements areCk. This observation formed the background for the second author's presentations in early 2014 Peters (2014), with the publication (Nguyen et al., 2014) illustrating the approach. Already (Kiendl et al., 2009) hinted at the use of geometric continuity by suggesting to uniformly stretch one of the domains of two abutting tensor-product functions. Such stretching represents a very special case ofG1continuity, that is called parametric continuity to emphasize that the union of both domains can be embedded in the plane by an affine change of variables. However, uniform stretching does not provide the change of variables necessary to address the general challenge presented by irregular points.The goal of the present paper is to formally prove the statement of the title and to thereby provide a theoretical framework forGk-basedCk-elements. Such elements can readily be constructed from the rich literature on geometric surface constructions or be based on new constructions in that field. For example, the construction in Scott et al. (2013) (see also Westgaard and Nowacki, 2001; Peters, 1995) could be used to build an isogeometric element rather than to just serve as a surface definition in the context of the boundary element method (there, linear combinations of trivariate Green's functions are to be determined, a setup quite different from the one discussed in the present paper).To keep the paper focused, we do not discuss the interesting and practically relevant issue of polynomial reproduction near irregular points, a property known under the name of ‘flexibility’ in the geometric design literature. It is only recently thatG2surface constructions that reproduce all quadratic modes at the extraordinary point have been derived (see e.g. Karčiauskas and Peters, 2015).The paper also does not comment on the related but different approach of using subdivision surfaces for isogeometric analysis (see e.g. Cirak et al., 2002) and it does not comment on methods that approximately enforce angle constraints through penalty functions, such as bending strips (Kiendl et al., 2010).Most recently, the technical report (Kapl et al., 2014), posted after submission of this paper, follows up on the theory and computations in Peters (2014), Nguyen et al. (2014) by exploring the space ofG1functions.This section reviews the concepts underlying our main observation: jets on a manifold, geometric continuity and the definition of isogeometric elements.Jets. Jets of order k are a precise way of capturing “all information of order ≤k at a point.” The k-jet of anRd-valuedCkmap defined on an open neighborhood of a points∈Rmis an equivalence class defined as follows. Fix an integerk≥1. Givenm,d≥1and a points∈Rm, consider the set of pairs(1)Fs,d:={(f,N)|Nis anRm−open neighborhood ofsandf:N→RdisCk}.For each m-tuplei:=(i1,…,im), where theijare non-negative integers, define|i|:=∑ijand let∂idenote the|i|th-order partial-differentiation operator(∂∂x1)i1…(∂∂xm)im. The relation∼skonFs,ddefined by(2)(f1,N1)∼sk(f2,N2)if∂if1(s)=∂if2(s)for alliwith|i|≤k,is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence class of f under∼skis the k-jet of f at s, denotedjskf. We writeJs,dkfor the set of k-jets ofRd-valued maps at s. Note that if(f1,N1)∼sk(f2,N2)then, taking|i|=0in (2), we havef1(s)=f2(s).IfU⊂Rm,V⊂Rℓare open, we can consider composableCkmapsf:U→V,g:V→Rd. Using the chain rule it is easily seen thatif(f1,U1)∼sk(f2,U2)and(g1,V1)∼f(s)k(g2,V2),then(g1∘f1,U1)∼sk(g2∘f2,U2),wheref(s):=f1(s)=f2(s)and ∘ denotes composition. This implies that there is a well-defined composition map∘:Jf(s),dk×Js,ℓk→Js,dksatisfying(3)jsk(g∘f)=(jf(s)kg)∘(jskf).In particular, this applies to the case in whichℓ=mand g is aCklocal diffeomorphism. This implies that jets and jet composition are well-defined whenRm,Rℓ,Rdare replaced byCkmanifolds. That is, k-jets of maps from oneCkmanifold to another are well-defined, and the composition law (3) holds in this larger context.Appendix A shows that the definition of jets also carries over, essentially unchanged, to half-spaces. Jets on half-spaces are used in the definition of geometric continuity below.Geometric continuity. Geometric continuity refers to matching geometric invariants. However, for practical constructions, the following parameterization-based definition of matching derivatives after a change of coordinates is widely accepted and equivalent in most relevant cases (Peters, 2002, Sect. 3). We formulate geometric continuity in m variables as follows.Fixk≥1. Fori=1,2, let□i⊂Rmbe an m-dimensional polytope, for example a unit cube, and letEibe an(m−1)-dimensional facet of□i, with interiorint(Ei)=E∘i. (Here and below, when we refer to the interiorP∘of a j-dimensional polytope P, we mean the interior of P as a j-dimensional object.) Suppose that we are given open setsN1,N2⊂RmcontainingE∘1,E∘2respectively, and aCkdiffeomorphism(4)ρ:N1→N2such that (cf. Fig. 1)ρ(E∘1)=E∘2,ρ(N1∩□∘1)=N2∖□2,ρ(N1∖□1)=N2∩□∘2.Observe that the second line of (4) can equivalently be written as(5)ρ(E∘1)=E∘2,ρ(N1∩□1)=N2∖□∘2,ρ(N1∖□∘1)=N2∩□2.Fori=1,2letxi:□i⊂Rm→RdbeCkmaps for which(6)x2(ρ(s))=x1(s)for alls∈E∘1;thus the images of thexijoin along a common interfaceE:=x2(E2)=x1(E1). We say thatx1joinsx2Gkwith reparameterization ρ along E if for everys∈E∘1we have(7)jskx1=jsk(x2∘ρ).Whenm=2,d=3, andxiare tensor-product splines then each□iis a rectangle and E is a boundary curve shared by the surface piecesx1(□1)andx2(□2)(see Fig. 1). Such pairwiseGkconstructions are used to assemble surfaces where three or more than four tensor-product splines are to be joined smoothly to enclose a point; placing the rectangular domains directly, without reparameterization, intoR2to form a joint domain yields an embedding only if exactly four rectangles meet.The mapsxiwith properties (6) and (7) will be used to provide a manifold domain. More generally, if functionsui:□i→RNsatisfyjsk(u1)=jsk(u2∘ρ)for alls∈E∘1, we say thatu1joinsu2Gkwith reparameterization ρ.Isogeometric elements. In the isoparametric approach to solving partial differential equations, mapsxi,i=1,2,…,n, parameterize a region or manifold X called the physical domain. The mapsxiare typically splines that map intoRd, i.e. withd=2ord=3component functions. The physical domain is tessellated into piecesxi(□i),(8)X:=∪i=1nxi(□i)⊂Rd,xi:□i⊂Rm→Rd.In the following we assume that eachxiis injective on its domain; hencexi−1is a well-defined map from the image ofxito□i.Whenm=2, i.e. in two variables, the□imay be, for example, unit squares. Ifm=2andd=2then X is a region of the xy-plane. Ifm=2andd=3, X is a surface embedded inR3. Ifm=d=3then X is a (solid) region inR3.The goal of the isoparametric approach is to compute, for some N, analysis functionsui:□i→RNsuch thatui∘xi−1solves a partial differential equation onxi(□i). The compositionui∘xi−1is called (a piece11Iso-geometric degrees of freedom are typically associated with a union of piecesxi(□i)of the physical domain (8). (see e.g. Nguyen et al., 2014).of) an isogeometric element if the scalar component functions of bothuiandxiare drawn from the same function-space, typically a space of tensor-product spline functions on□i.In the following, we can confine our attention to two maps, i.e.i=1,2(n=2).We want to show thatGkconstructions yieldCkisogeometric elements. The proof is an adaptation of the definition of a smooth function on a manifold. First we identify aCkatlas on a domainX∘12defined by joiningx1andx2withGkcontinuity. With this atlas,X∘12becomes aCkmanifold as we will now explain in detail.Ckatlas fromGkcontinuity. Consider injective mapsx1,x2, ρ satisfying the assumptions of (4) and (7), and such that the imagesx1(□∘1),x2(□∘2)are disjoint. DefineE∘=x1(E∘1)(=x2(E∘2)by hypothesis). We exhibit aCk-manifold structure on the set(9)X∘12:=int(x1(□1)∪x2(□2)):=x1(□∘1)∪E∘∪x2(□∘2)as follows. WithNian open set containingE∘i,Vi:=□∘i∪Niis an extension of the interior of the domain□i. We extendx1|□∘1to a function(10)x˜1:V1→Rd,x˜1(s):={x1(s)ifs∈V1∩□1,x2(ρ(s))ifs∈V1∖□1=N1∖□1,and extendx2|□∘2to an analogous function(11)x˜2:V2→Rd,x˜2(s):={x2(s)ifs∈V2∩□2,x1(ρ−1(s))ifs∈V2∖□2=N2∖□2,(12)x˜2:V2→Rd,x˜2(s)={x2(s)ifs∈V2∩□∘2,x1(ρ−1(s))ifs∈V2∖□∘2=N2∖□∘2.(The equality between (11) and (12) follows from (6).) Because of the jet-equality (7), the extended mapsx˜iareCk. Regardingx˜ias a map fromVitox˜i(Vi), we writex˜i−1for the inverse of this map. Now observe that (12) and (5) imply that(13)x˜2−1(y)={x2−1(y)ify∈x2(V2∩□∘2),ρ(x1−1(y))ify∈x1(ρ−1(N2∖□∘2))=x1(N1∩□1).Ifs∈N1∖□1thenx˜1(s)∈x2(ρ(N1∖□1))=x2(N2∩□∘2)⊂x2(V2∩□∘2), implyingx˜2−1(x˜1(s))=x2−1(x2(ρ(s)))=ρ(s), while ifs∈N1∩□1thenx˜1(s)=x1(s)∈x1(N1∩□1), implyingx˜2−1(x˜1(s))=ρ(x1−1(x1(s)))=ρ(s). Hence(14)x˜2−1∘x˜1|N1=ρ,and similarlyx˜1−1∘x˜2|N2=ρ−1.Therefore{(V1,x˜1−1),(V2,x˜2−1)}is aCkatlas onX∘12as claimed.This observation generalizes and makes more precise a similar statement for surfaces in Peters (2002, Sect. 3.2).The main result. We are now ready to prove the main result.Theorem 1MatchedGkconstructions yieldCkisogeometric elementsFori=1,2, considerCkmapsui:□i→RNandxi:□i→Rdand assume that eachxiis injective and the imagesx1(□∘1),x2(□∘2)are disjoint. Assume thatx1joinsx2GkalongE:=x1(E1)=x2(E2)with reparameterization ρ (defined in(4)) and that the analysis functionsuimatch the setup in thatu1joinsu2Gkwith the same reparameterization ρ. Letu˜12:X∘12→RN(withX∘12defined in(9)) be the piecewise isogeometric element defined by(15)u˜12(y):={u1∘x1−1(y)ify∈x1(□∘1),u2∘x2−1(y)ify∈x2(□∘2∪E∘2).Then•u˜12isCkandu˜12is the unique functionX∘12→RNthat restricts toui∘xi−1onxi(□∘i∪E∘i)fori=1,2.ProofTheGk-join condition on theuiensures that(16)u2(ρ(s))=u1(s)for alls∈E∘1,which together with theGk-join condition on thexiimplies thatu1∘x1−1(y)=u2∘x2−1(y)for ally∈E∘:=x1(E∘1)=x2(E∘2).Henceu˜12agrees withu1∘x1−1onx1(E∘1)as well as onx1(□∘1). Thereforeu˜12agrees withui∘xi−1onxi(□∘i∪E∘i)for bothi=1andi=2. Uniqueness of a functionX∘12→RNthat restricts toui∘xi−1onxi(□∘i∪E∘i)for both i is clear, since any such function satisfies the defining equation (15) foru˜12.For both i,ui∘xi−1isCkonxi(□∘i)andu˜12|xi(□∘i)=ui∘xi−1|xi(□∘i). Therefore, to show thatu˜12isCk, it suffices to verify thatu˜12isCkat each point ofE∘. Hence it suffices to check thatjyk(u2∘x2−1)=jyk(u1∘x1−1)at every pointy∈E∘.Definex˜1,x˜2as in (10) and (11). The assumed injectivity of thexiand disjointness of the imagesx1(□∘1),x2(□∘2)imply that (14) holds; in particular, thatx˜2−1|x˜1(N1)=ρ∘x˜1−1|x˜1(N1). Applying the composition law (3) toCkmaps betweenCkmanifolds-with-boundary and omitting the notation indicating restriction tox˜1(N1), for ally∈E∘(a subset ofx˜1(N1)), we havejyk(u2∘x2−1)=jyk(u2∘x˜2−1)=jyk(u2∘ρ∘x˜1−1)=(jx˜1−1(y)k(u2∘ρ))∘jyk(x˜1−1)=(jx˜1−1(y)ku1)∘jyk(x˜1−1)=jyk(u1∘x˜1−1)=jyk(u1∘x1−1).The first and last equalities above are true by the definition of jets at boundaries of half-spaces; see Appendix A.  □We can extend theCkstructure to the outer boundaries of the domains□iby strengthening the disjointness assumption tox1(□1)∩x2(□2)=E. Indeed, if Z is any metric space and the functionsuiare continuous, then (16) is a necessary and sufficient condition for existence and uniqueness of a continuous functionu˜from the larger domainx1(□1)∪x2(□2)to Z whose restriction to E coincides with bothu1∘x1−1|V1andu2∘x2−1|V2(whereViare the sets defined prior to (10)). Also, it is not hard to adapt the proof to the case where E is the image of just a piece of the boundary of eachEi.
