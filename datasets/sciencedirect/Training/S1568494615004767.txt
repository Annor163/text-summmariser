@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a novel robust observer-based adaptive controller is presented using a proposed simplified type-2 fuzzy neural network (ST2FNN) and a new three dimensional type-2 membership function is presented. Proposed controller can be applied to the control of high-order nonlinear systems and adaptation of the consequent parameters and stability analysis are carried out using Lyapunov theorem. Moreover, a new adaptive compensator is presented to eliminate the effect of the external disturbance, unknown nonlinear functions approximation errors and sate estimation errors. In the proposed scheme, using the Lyapunov and Barbalat's theorem it is shown that the system is stable and the tracking error of the system converges to zero asymptotically. The proposed method is simulated on a flexible joint robot, two-link robot manipulator and inverted double pendulums system. Simulation results confirm that in contrast to other robust techniques, our proposed method is simple, give better performance in the presence of noise, external disturbance and uncertainties, and has less computational cost.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Over the past decade, adaptive control of uncertain nonlinear systems has attracted growing interest. To cope with uncertainties many adaptive fuzzy control methods have been presented based on approximation capability of fuzzy neural networks [1–16]. Adaptive fuzzy control methods include direct and indirect schemes. The direct one uses a fuzzy system to estimate an unknown ideal controller and in the indirect one, fuzzy systems are employed to estimate unknown nonlinear functions. One of the most limitations of indirect scheme is the effects of external disturbances, function approximation and state estimation errors. To solve this problem some techniques are presented in literatures. In Refs. [1,2] upper bound of optimal approximation error (AE) has been estimated and in Refs. [3–6] a variable structure term has been added to the control signal where bounds of unknown functions must be known that is difficult in practice. In Ref. [7] based on the bounds of fuzzy approximation parameters and back-stepping technique the robustness of the adaptive fuzzy controller to external disturbance has been improved. In Refs. [8,9] sliding-mode approach has been proposed in which the bounds of unknown functions must be known. Instead of estimation of the unknown functions directly, a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system has been employed to approximate a so-called virtual linearized system in Ref. [10], which include external disturbance. In Ref. [2] by obtaining the upper bound of optimal AE the stability of the closed loop system has been studied.Recently H∞ techniques [11,12] have also been used to deal with robust stabilization in fuzzy control problems. In Refs. [13–15] based on small gain theorem a way of eliminating for external disturbance effect has been described. A common drawback of aforementioned works [11–15] is that many parameters need to be tuned. Furthermore the sufficient stabilization condition for the existence of a positive definite matrix, is difficult to achieve. Furthermore some controller based on intelligent computing have been presented. For instance in [16] PSO-GA optimization method has been used to minimize the steady state error of a plant's response. In Ref. [17], a controller by using generalized type-2 fuzzy system has been proposed to control of a mobile robot. In Ref. [18] a type-2 fuzzy system has been employed to calculate the feedback gain such that the steady-state error be reduced. The results has been compared with conventional PID controller.Another main problem in the design of controller, based on approximation property of fuzzy systems, is the problem of “curse of dimensionality” and “explosion of complexity”. With the rise of the input variables of a fuzzy system, the number of rules increases exponentially. To handle this problem, the hierarchical fuzzy systems in Ref. [19] has been introduced in which the number of rules is linearly depending to the number of input variables. In this paper a new simplified type-2 fuzzy neural network by using 3-dimensional membership functions is presented to overcome the problem of exponential growth of the number of fuzzy rules. Dynamic surface control has been developed in Refs. [20–22] to cope with this problem in the back-stepping approach procedure.Type-2 fuzzy system can model uncertainties better than type-1 [23] and the development of type-2 fuzzy systems is important in the performance improvement [24]. In the past few years interval type-2 fuzzy system has been widely studied [25–29]. Adaptive dynamic surface control has been studied in Ref. [29]. In this paper the uncertainties have been modeled by T2FNNs and closed-loop stability has been investigated based on Lyaponuv theorem. Adaptive type-2 fuzzy PI control has been proposed in Ref. [30] for class of uncertain nonlinear time delay systems. Backstepping control by using type-2 fuzzy systems has been designed in Ref. [31] and has been applied on flexible air-breathing hypersonic vehicle. In Ref. [32] an adaptive type-2 fuzzy control has been presented, in which a H∞ compensator has been added to attenuate the effect of fuzzy approximation error. A review on the applications of type-2 fuzzy systems in pattern recognition and intelligent control has been presented in Refs. [33,34]. To design optimal type-2 fuzzy systems several techniques have been presented for tuning free parameters. For instance recursive orthogonal least-squares algorithm has been proposed in Ref. [35] to design type-2 fuzzy controller for prediction of the transfer bar surface temperature in an industrial hot strip mill facility. Multi-objective genetic optimization of type-2 fuzzy controllers has been investigated in Ref. [36]. Steepest-descent method, which is referred to as recursive back-propagation mechanism, has been proposed in Ref. [37] to adjust the parameters of proposed type-2 fuzzy system. A review on the techniques used in the optimization of type-2 fuzzy controllers has been considered in Ref. [38].Type-2 fuzzy systems have more computational cost in the type-reduction part and to solve this problem and reduce the computational burden, some simplified typ-2 fuzzy systems have been proposed. For instance in Refs. [39,40], the q coefficient has been used to adjust the proportion of the upper and lower bounds in the type-reduction part instead of Karnik-Mendel (KM) iterative procedure. In Ref. [41] original KM algorithm has been improved to increase its speed. Some alternative type-reduction algorithms [42–44] have been presented which are faster than KM algorithm. The direct defuzzification for type-2 fuzzy systems has been proposed in Ref. [45] and has been compared with type-reduction. In Ref. [46] genetic algorithm has been proposed for type-reduction. A useful review on type-reduction of type-2 fuzzy sets has been presented in Ref. [47].As mentioned above, in the design of adaptive fuzzy controllers, we have some challenges such as great computational cost, the effects of approximation error, external disturbances and the effect of state estimation errors on the stability of closed-loop system. In this paper a novel robust observer-based indirect adaptive type-2 fuzzy controller is presented for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems, in which a new adaptive compensator is designed to eliminate of the approximation error, external disturbance effect and state estimation errors. Furthermore simplified type-2 FNN with less computational cost in type-reduction part is proposed. By using proposed 3-dimensional type-2 membership functions, the problem of the “curse of dimensionality” is solved and the proposed controller can be applied to high order systems. Most contribution of this paper are as follows:•To cope with the problem of the curse of dimensionality, new type-2 3-dimensional membership function is presented.To decrease the computational cost in the type-reduction part, improved and simplified type-2 fuzzy neural network is presented.It's assumed that the all states of the system are unmeasurable, and a robust observer is designed.The effect of external disturbance and approximation errors and state estimation errors are eliminated using the new proposed adaptive compensator.The stability and zero convergence of the tracking errors is investigated using Lyapunov and Barbalat's theorems.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: problem formulation and preliminaries are given in Section 2. State observer scheme is presented in Section 3 and proposed simplified T2FNN is illustrated in Section 4. Stability analysis and derivation of adaption laws are presented in Section 5. Simulation studies to demonstrate the performances of the proposed method are provided in Sections 6 and 7 gives the conclusions of the advocated design methodology.The following class of single input single output (SISO) nonlinear systems is considered:(1)x˙1=x2x˙2=x3⋮x˙n=f(x_)+g(x_)u+dy=x1wherex_=x1,x2,…,xnT=x1,x˙1,…,x1(n−1)Tis a state vector and xi, i=2, …, n are assumed to be unmeasurable, vector functions f(.) and g(.) are unknown but bounded, u∈R is the control signal, y∈R is the output of the system and d is the bounded unknown external disturbance. The reference signal and tracking error vectors are defined as follows:(2)y_r=yr,y˙r,…,yr(n−1)Te_=x_−y_r=e,e˙,…,e(n−1)Teˆ_=xˆ_−y_r=eˆ,eˆ˙,…,eˆ(n−1)Twherexˆ_andeˆ_are the estimate ofx_ande_. The Eq. (1), can be rewritten in the state space form(3)xˆ_=Ax_+Bf(x_)+g(x_)u+d,y=CTx_in which,(4)A=0100⋯000010⋯00⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯0000⋯010000⋯00,B=00⋮01,C=10⋮00Assumption 1we assume0<g(x_)<∞, so (3) is controllable in certain controllability region Uc⊂Rn, [48,49]. If the system functionsf(x_)andg(x_)are known and the disturbance d(t)=0, based on the well-known feedback linearization theory, the ideal controller u* can be chosen as follows:(5)u*=g−1(x_)[−f(x_)+yr(n)−KcTe_]whereKc=kc1,kc2,…,kcnT∈Rnare chosen such that polynomial sn+kcnsn−1+⋯+kc1 be Hurwitz stable [50]. Since the state vectorx_is not available to measure and the functionsf(x_)andg(x_)are unknown, the ideal controller (5) cannot be implementable. To cope these problems following steps are considered in this paper:•The unknown nonlinear functions are estimated using a proposed adaptive ST2FNN.A state observer is designed.A new compensator is designed to eliminate the effect of the external disturbance and the approximation error.Based on the previously mentioned problems and to solve them, (5) is rewritten as follows:(6)u=gˆ(xˆ_)+ɛsigngˆ(xˆ_)−1[−fˆ(xˆ_)+yr(n)−KcTeˆ_+us]wherexˆ_,gˆ(xˆ_),fˆ(xˆ_)andeˆ_are the estimations ofx_,g(x_),f(x_)ande_respectively. The ɛ is a small positive constant and using the termɛsigngˆ(xˆ_)in (6), solve the singularity problem of u and thesigngˆ(xˆ_)is a typical signum defined as follows:(7)signgˆ(xˆ_)=1gˆ(xˆ_)≥00gˆ(xˆ_)<0The usis the adaptive term which has been considered to eliminate the effect of the approximation error and external disturbance and it can guarantee the robustness of the controller. The block diagram of the proposed scheme is shown in Fig. 1.By adding and subtractinggˆ(xˆ_)+ɛsigngˆ(xˆ_)u, (3) becomes(8)x˙_=Ax_+Bf(x_)+g(x_)−gˆ(xˆ_)−ɛsigngˆ(xˆ_)u+gˆ(xˆ_)+ɛsigngˆ(xˆ_)u+dy=CTx_Applying (6)–(8) gives(9)e˙_=Ae_−BKcTeˆ_+B{f(x_)−fˆ(xˆ_)+[g(x_)−gˆ(xˆ_)−ɛsign(gˆ(xˆ_))]u+us+d},e1=CTe_where e1=yr−y=yr−x1. From (9), an observer to estimate the vectore_is obtained as follows [48,51]:(10)e˙_=Ae_−BKcTeˆ_+B{f(x_)−fˆ(xˆ_)+[g(x_)−gˆ(xˆ_)−ɛsign(gˆ(xˆ_))]u+us+d}e1=CTe_where,Ko=kon,kon−1,…,ko1T∈Rnis the observer gain vector that is chosen such that the characteristic polynomial A−KoCTis Hurwitz. Subtracting (10) from (9) gives the dynamics of the observation error as follows:(11)e˜˙_=(A−KoCT)e˜_+B{f(x_)−fˆ(xˆ_)+[g(x_)−gˆ(xˆ_)−ɛsign(gˆ(xˆ_))]u+us+d},e˜1=CTe˜_In this part an interval type-2 FNN is employed where the new proposed 3-dimensional gaussian Membership Functions (MF) with mean m and standard deviationσ∈σ¯,σ_is used which is shown in Fig. 2. The T2FNN structure is shown in Fig. 3.The output of the proposed ST2FNN is computed as follows:Membership layer: In this layer the firing degree of upper and lower MF is obtained as below:(12)μ¯kj(xp,xq)=exp−12(xp−mkj)2+(xq−mkj)2(σ¯kj)2μ_kj(xp,xq)=exp−12(xp−mkj)2+(xq−mkj)2(σ_kj)2in whichμ¯kjandμ_kjare the upper and lower firing degrees of j-th MF for the k-th input set that is contain inputs p and q. Themkjis the center of j-th MF for the k-th input set and,σ¯kjandσ_kjare the upper and lower widths of j-th MF for k-th input set. It must be noted that in the T2FNN flowchart as given in Fig. 3, we consider N membership functions for each input set.Rule layer: each node in this layer represent a fuzzy rule which compute the upper and lower firing degrees [52]:(13)Z¯j=∏k=1nμ¯kpkZ_j=∏k=1nμ_kpkin whichZ¯jandZ_jare the upper and lower firing degrees of j-th rule respectively.μ¯kpkandμ_kpkare the upper and lower firing degree of pk-th MF for the k-th input set respectively and N is the number of inputs set.Type-reduction layer: Based on the center of sets type reduction yrand yldefines as follows:(14)yr=∑j=1RZ_jwrj+∑j=R+1MZ¯jwrj∑j=1RZ_j+∑j=R+1MZ¯j,yl=∑j=1LZ¯jwlj+∑j=L+1MZ_jwlj∑j=1LZ¯j+∑j=L+1MZ_jin which R and L are obtained from KM iterative algorithm [52].wrjandwljare the consequent parameters in the j-th upper and lower rules respectively.Z¯jandZ_jare the upper and lower firing degree of j-th rule respectively and m is the number of rules. To increase the controller speed and reduce computational cost, motivated by Ref. [39], we propose following type-reduction in which qrand qlare the adaptive parameters:(15)yr=qr∑j=1MZ_jwrj+(1−qr)∑j=1MZ¯jwrjqr∑j=1MZ_j+(1−qr)∑j=1MZ¯j,yl=ql∑j=1MZ¯jwlj+(1−ql)∑j=1MZ_jwljql∑j=1MZ¯j+(1−ql)∑j=1MZ_jIf the number of MFs for each input set be N, then m will be M=N2 in which N is the number of input set. In the conventional center of sets type reduction, in each sample time, KM iterative algorithm must be repeated that impose great computational cost. In our proposed method only two parameters qrand qlmust be updated. We obtain adaptation laws for these parameters as follows (see Eqs. (22), (23) and (31):(16)q˙r=12γfe˜_TPoB∑j=1MZ¯j∑j=1MZ_jwrj−∑j=1MZ¯jwrj−∑j=1MZ¯jwrj∑j=1MZ_j−∑j=1MZ¯j∑j=1MZ_j−∑j=1MZ¯jqr+∑j=1MZ¯j2q˙l=12γfe˜_TPoB∑j=1MZ_j∑j=1MZ¯jwlj−∑j=1MZ_jwlj−∑j=1MZ_jwlj∑j=1MZ¯j−∑j=1MZ_j∑j=1MZ¯j−∑j=1MZ_jql+∑j=1MZ_j2Output layer: The defuzzified crisp output defined as the average of yrand yl:(17)y=yr+yl2The unknown nonlinear functionsf(x_)andg(x_)in (5) are estimated using the proposed ST2FNN respectively. Optimal tunable parameters offˆ(xˆ_)andgˆ(xˆ_)are defined as follows:(18)θf*=argmin[supx∈Ux|fˆ(xˆ_|θf*)−f(x_)]θg*=argmin[supx∈Ux|gˆ(xˆ_|θg*)−g(x_)|]wherefˆ(xˆ_)andgˆ(xˆ_)are the estimation off(x_)andg(x_), and Uxis the range of x. According to the Taylor expansion series:(19)fˆ*(xˆ_|θf*)−fˆ(xˆ_|θf)=θf*−θfTδfˆ(xˆ_|θf)δθf+oθf*−θf2gˆ*(xˆ_θg*)−gˆ(xˆ_θg)=θg*−θgTδgˆ(xˆ_|θg)δθg+oθg*−θg2in whichoθf*−θf2andoθg*−θg2are the higher-order terms. Then(20)fˆ(xˆ_|θf)=θfTζf(xˆ_)gˆ(xˆ_|θg)=θgTζg(xˆ_)whereζf(xˆ_)=Δδfˆ(xˆ_|θf)δθfTandζg(xˆ_)=Δδgˆ(xˆ_|θg)δθgT. The θfand θgare trainable parameters that are consist ofwr,wl, qrand ql. It must be noted that the center and width of membership functions are not trained (are fixed), but are chosen to cover all range of its input.

We design controller step by step as follows:1.The feedback and observer gains Kcand Koare chosen such that all roots of the polynomial s4+kc4s3+kc3s2+kc2s+kc1 and s4+ko1s3+ko2s2+ko3s+ko4 are in −10 and −20 respectively.By considering Qcand Qoin (29), as what are coming below, after solving (29), the positive definite matrix Pcand Poare:(51)Qc=Qo=10−31000010000100001Pc=1.38810.65490.095500.65490.32970.05420.00030.09550.05420.01200.000100.00030.00010Po=313.5117−0.0005−0.50470.0005−0.00050.5047−0.0005−0.0040−0.5047−0.00050.0040−0.00050.0005−0.0040−0.00050.0001Given that y=z1=x1 andyr(s)=10s+101s, solve (10) to obtainzˆ=zˆ1zˆ2zˆ3zˆ4T.A proposed ST2FNNfˆ(zˆ), is used to estimate f(z) in (50). We consider three MF as shown in Fig. 2 for input sets(zˆ1,zˆ2)and(zˆ3,zˆ4)with centers[−101], upper widths 0.8 and lower widths 0.4.We chose adaptation ratesγE¯ˆf=0.5,γd¯ˆ=0.5,γθf=0.1The compensator control signal is obtained as (6) in which,(52)us=−tanhe˜_TPoBE¯ˆf+d¯ˆ+e˜_TPcKoe˜1e˜_TPoB+0.001Simulation results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, where Fig. 4 gives the tracking response and tracking error. Fig. 5 depicts the control signal. It can be seen that tracking error converged to small neighborhood around zero, expeditiously. Simulation results confirm that our proposed controller can guarantee the stability and robustness of the closed loop system.Example 2In this example, the proposed controller is applied to a two-link robot manipulator as shown in Fig. 6.The dynamic equation of the system is as follows [54]:(53)H11H12H21H22q¨1q¨2+−hq˙2−hq˙2+q˙2hq˙10q˙1q˙2=τ1τ2with(54)H11=α1+2α3cosq2+2α4sinq2aH12=H21=α2+α3cosq2+α4sinq2H22=α2h=α3sinq2−α4cosq2α1=I1+m1lc12+Ie+melce2+mel12α2=Ie+melce2α3=mel1lcecosδeα4=mel1lcesinδeThe state space model of the system can be written as follows:(55)x˙11=x12x˙12=f1(x11,x12,x21,x22,u2)+g1(x11,x12,x21,x22)u1x˙21=x22x˙22=f2(x11,x12,x21,x22,u1)+g2(x11,x12,x21,x22)u2y1=x12,y2=x22where(56)x11=q1,x12=q˙1,x21=q2,x22=q˙2,u1=τ1,u2=τ2f1f2=H11H12H21H22−1−hx22−hx22+x12hx120x12x22g1=H22H22H11−H12H21,g2=H11H22H11−H12H21Simulation parameters are m1=1, l1=1, me=2, δe=30°, I1=0.12, lc1=0.5, Ie=0.25, lce=0.6 Reference signal is considered to be yr=sin(t). According to the design procedure, f1, f2, g1 and g2 in (55), are estimated using the proposed ST2FNNfˆ1,fˆ2,gˆ1andgˆ2. Note that functionsfˆ1andfˆ2have five inputs. We consider three proposed MF for input setsxˆ11,xˆ12andxˆ21,xˆ22as shown in Fig. 2, with centers[−101], upper widths 0.8 and lower widths 0.4, and three Gaussian MFs as shown in Fig. 7, for inputs u1 and u2. The controllers u1 and u2 are designed as illustrated in example 1. The controller parameters are chosen as follows:(57)Qc=1001,Pc=3.34620.0030.0030.0193,Kc=16926TQo=1001,Po=10.0062−0.5−0.50.0313,Ko=801600TγE¯ˆf=0.1,γd¯ˆ=0.1,γθf=10,γθg=10,γw¯ˆg=0.1,ɛ=0.001Tracking performance and tracking errors are shown in Fig. 13, and the control signal is given in Fig. 14. The state estimation results are depicted in Figs. 11 and 15. It can be seen from Figs. 8–10that the closed loop system is asymptotically stable and confirm that the proposed controller performs very well.Example 3In this example two inverted pendulums that are connected by a moving spring and mounted on two carts are considered [7] which its configuration is shown in Fig. 12.State space representation of the system can be written as follows [7]:(58)x˙11=x12x˙12=f1(x11,x12,x21,x22)+g1u1x˙21=x22x˙22=f2(x11,x12,x21,x22)+g2u2y1=x12,y2=x22with(59)f1(x11,x12,x21,x22)=gclx11−mMx122sin(x11)+ka(t)−clcml2−a(t)x11+a(t)x21−x1+x2f2(x11,x12,x21,x22)=gclx21−mMx222sin(x21)+ka(t)−clcml2−a(t)x21+a(t)x11+x1−x2g1=g2=1cml2a(t)=sin(wt),x1=sin(w1t),x2=sin(w2t)+LSimulation parameters areM=m=10,l=1,c=0.5,w=5,w1=2,w1=3,L=2.Reference signal is considered to be yr=0. According to the design procedure, it is assumed that f1(x11, x12, x21, x22) and f2(x11, x12, x21, x22) in (58), are unknown and are estimated using the proposed ST2FNN. The initial membership functions for input setsxˆ11,xˆ12andxˆ21,xˆ22are considered similar to the previous examples with centers[−101], upper widths 0.8 and lower width 0.4. The controller parameters are chosen as follows:(60)Qc=1001,Pc=25.01000.0025,Kc=10,000200TQo=1001,Po=137.5−0.5−0.50.0023,Ko=1100302,500TγE¯ˆf1=0.05,γE¯ˆf2=0.05,γθf1=5,γθf2=5,ɛ=0.001Tracking performance is shown in Fig. 13. Control signals are given in Fig. 14and state estimation results are depicted in Figs. 15 and 16. From Figs. 12–14, it can be seen that the performance of the proposed controller is satisfactory.Robust method based on back-stepping technique in [7] is applied to the control of the inverted double pendulums system of example 3. It is valuable to note that the tunable parameters in our proposed method are less than that of [7] and the tracking errors is significantly less.Remark 3For comparison, the results with using type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems are given in Table 1, where ui, i=1, 2 are the control signals, ei=yi−r i=1, 2 are the tracking errors andeij=xij−xˆij,i,j=1,2are the state estimation errors, T is final time and ts=0.001 is the sample time. As it can be seen the performance by using type-2 fuzzy sets is better than type-1 counterpart. Furthermore the number MFs to achieve good performance in the case of type-2 is less than type-1. As mentioned before, a higher level of uncertainty can be modelled by type-2 fuzzy sets.
