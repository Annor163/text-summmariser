@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behaviors of the loss reservings computed by individual data method and its aggregate data versions by Chain-Ladder (CL) and Bornhuetter–Ferguson (BF) algorithms. It is shown that all deviations of the three reservings from the individual loss reserve (the projection of the outstanding liability on the individual data) converge weakly to a zero-mean normal distribution at thenrate. The analytical forms of the asymptotic variances are derived and compared by both analytical and numerical examples. The results show that the individual method has the smallest asymptotic variance, followed by the BF algorithm, and the CL algorithm has the largest asymptotic variance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Predicting future losses (outstanding liabilities) and thus the reserves required to cover them, referred to as loss reserving, is a crucial and indispensable task of risk management in the insurance and financial industries. It has been increasingly recognized that loss reservings based directly on individual data (raw data, or micro-level data, see, e.g. Antonio and Plat, 2014) are generally more accurate than those computed from aggregate data (macro-level data), at the cost of higher operation/management expenditure on data collection, storage and computations. This is because the former makes better use of the information included in the data, whereas the latter generally aggregates data without a clear purpose in risk management and rational justification in statistical theory. In other words, the use of aggregate data allows a substantial reduction in operation loadings, but sacrifices the accuracy of loss reserving. To date, however, it is unclear how much accuracy has been sacrificed in loss reserving using the aggregate data versus the more informative individual data. On the other hand, the main reason for aggregating data in old days was the lack of facilities and the high costs to storing, transporting and retrieving information from the raw data, which is no longer a big issue with the fast development of modern technology. As noted ten years ago by England and Verrall (2002) and Taylor and Campbell (2002), lots of useful information about the claims data remains unused if data are aggregated. There has been a limited literature on the efforts to provide evidence for the advantage of loss reservings using individual data. The examples include:•Antonio and Plat (2014), Pigeon, Antonio, and Denuit (2013; 2014) conducted empirical studies based on a set of common real-life micro-level data from a European insurance company, with parameterized versions (so that the maximum likelihood procedure can be applied to estimate the unknown parameters) of Norberg’s Position Dependent Marked Poisson Process model (in continuous time, cf. Norberg, 1993; 1999). It was shown that the micro-level approaches provided closer prediction of the future liabilities for a subset of the data that have been settled so that the liabilities are in fact observed at the assumed reserve evaluating date (referred to as out-of-sample prediction).Huang, Qiu, and Wu (2015), under a special micro-level data set with only once payment for every claim at its settlement, proved the almost sure convergence of their loss reserving at a rate of order o(n) theoretically. They further showed that the individual loss reserve (the projection of the outstanding liability on the individual data) outperforms the aggregate loss reserve (the projection of the outstanding liability on the aggregate data) in mean squared deviation from the individual loss reserves, and the individual loss reserving outperforms (with smaller bias and variance than) such traditional aggregate loss reservings as the Chain Ladder (CL) and Bornhuetter–Ferguson (BF) methods via Monte Carlo simulations.For an outstanding liability L, a broadly used criterion to compare different loss reserving procedures is the (conditional) mean squared error of prediction (abbreviated as MSEP in the literature)(1.1)MSEPL|Data=E[(L^−L)2|Data]=Var(L|Data)+(L^−E[L|Data])2,whereL^is aData-measurable predictor/estimate (or simply referred to as a loss reserve) of L. In Antonio and Plat (2014)and Pigeon et al. (2013, 2014),MSEPL|Datawas computed by empirical data where the future liabilities were known from the data. Theoretically, it was estimated by the data (in micro- or macro-level) using for example the bootstrap method. Examples that have been discussed are MSEP of the CL method (Mack, 1993), Benktander model (Mack, 2000), the BF method under generalized linear models (Alai, Merz, & Wüthrich, 2009; 2010) and MSEP of loss reservings under Log-normal/Log-normal model, the exponential dispersion model and other stochastic models (see, e.g., Wüthrich & Merz, 2008). Note that, as a function of the observed data that is free of the reserving procedures, the termVar(L|Data)in (1.1) contributes only a constant to MSEP and thus can be ignored in measuring the deviation of the reservingL^from the outstanding liability L, so that one can just address the term(L^−E[L|Data])2,for comparing different reserving methods. For simplicity, we refer to(L^−E[L|Data])2as the mean squared error (MSE) below. It is obvious that the estimated conditional MSE/MSEP is also a random variable and thus, when more than one loss reserving method are in hand, does not give a clear picture of which one would be better.Generally, a feasible way is to use unconditionalE[(L^−E[L|Data])2]to comprehensively measure the deviation of the loss reserving from the outstanding liability/loss reserve, as what have done in Huang et al. (2015) by means of Monte Carlo simulations. As argued by Huang et al. (2015), in the situations where micro-level data (denoted byD) are available, one should measure the deviation(L^−E[L|D])2,rather than(L^−E[L|AD])2based on aggregated data, whereADindicates some aggregated data (macro-level data) produced from the micro-level data.The other way that can give perfect characteristics of a loss reservingL^is to compare the distribution ofL^−E[L|D]. Because it is usually impossible to obtain the exact distribution of the deviation in fixed sample size, a usual alternative is to study its asymptotic distribution. This paper is dedicated to derive the asymptotic distributions of loss reservings and compare different reserving procedures. More specifically, we investigate the asymptotic behaviors of the loss reservings based on individual data and their CL and BF versions based on the deduced aggregated data proposed in Huang et al. (2015). The key contributions of this paper are highlighted as follows:(a)We derive the asymptotically normal distributions ofL^−E[L|D]for individual and aggregate loss reservingsL^. While the aggregate procedures have been used for decades, this paper appears the first to derive the asymptotic distributions ofL^−E[L|D]under both individual and aggregate methods.Based on the asymptotic distributions, we compare the accuracy of the three loss reservings in terms of their asymptotic variances. While they are all weakly convergent at a rate of ordern,the numerical examples show that the asymptotic variance is smallest with individual loss reserving and largest with the CL loss reserving, while the BF reserving takes an intermediate place that is closer to the CL method.These findings indicate the preference order of the loss reservings: Individual loss reserving is more accurate than its BF version, and the BF procedure is more accurate than its CL version.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, after introducing the notations for observations and parameters concerned, data structure, model assumptions and estimates of the unknown parameters proposed in Huang et al. (2015) for later reference, we review the three loss reserving methods: individual data method, CL method and BF method. In Section 3, we give asymptotic distributions of the deviations of the three reservings from the individual loss reserveE[L|D]and then make some analytical and numerical comparisons on their asymptotic variances. The technically complicated proofs of the asymptotic distributions are relegated in Section 4 so as to smooth the flow of the text. The final section concludes the paper.This section first reviews the data structure, distribution assumptions, and the parameter estimation developed in Huang et al. (2015). Some notations are also introduced in this section.Following Huang et al. (2015), all claims are organized in accident yearsi=0,1,…,Iand loss reserving is evaluated at the end of the latest accident year. The data are structured with the following items:(a)In every accident year i, there are nipolicies so thatn:=∑i=0Iniis the total number of policies exposed to allI+1accident years, where “ ≔ ” reads “defined as”.For the kth policy of accident year i, referred to as policy (i, k), denote byeik∈[0,1]its exposure, Mikthe number of its claims, and (i, k, l) its lth claim event,l=1,2,…,Mikso that, the quantitiesei:=∑k=1nieikandNi:=∑k=1niMikare respectively the total exposure and number of claims occurring in accident year i. Also denotee(r)=∑i=0I−rei,r=0,1,…,J1.For each claim event (i, k, l), there exists a maximum reporting delay J1 and a maximum settlement delay J2 satisfyingI=J=J1+J2,where J indicates the maximum development year, and a claim is only paid once at the end of its claim settlement year. Denote by Riklits reporting delay, Tiklsettlement delay and Yiklclaim amount.Next presented are the technical assumptions regarding the joint distribution of the data.Assumption 2.1(a)The claims data{Mik;{Rikl,Tikl,Yikl}l=1∞}are mutually independent over policies (i, k) fork=1,2,…,niandi=0,1,…,I.For every policy (i, k),•the claims number Mik ∼ Poisson(λeik), independent of the sequence of random triplets{(Rikl,Tikl,Yikl),l=1,2,…},where λ is the unknown intensity of claims numbers from a risk with unit exposure, andthe triplets(Rikl,Tikl,Yikl),l=1,2…,are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) as a representative (R, T, Y), whose joint distribution is determined by the unknown parameterspr=Pr(R=r),qrt=Pr(T=t|R=r)and(μrtνrt)=E[(YY2)|R=r,T=t],r=0,1,…,J1,t=0,1,…,J2.Writeλr=λpr,μr′=(μr0,μr1,…,μrJ2),qr′=(qr0,qr1,…,qrJ2)andcrt=qrt∑l=tJ2qrl=Pr(T=t|R=r,T≥t),t=0,1,…,J2,r=0,1,…,J1.The limits ni/n → κi∈ (0, 1)andn(ei/n−e˘i)→0hold for everyi=0,…,Ias the total number of individuals n → ∞. Accordingly, denotee˘(r)=∑i=0I−re˘i,r=0,1,…,J1.For any vector x, use diag(x) to indicate the diagonal matrix generated by the components of x, so that if we have two column vectorsx1∈Rpandx2∈Rq,thendiag(x1,x2)=(diag(x1)00diag(x2))∈R(p+q)×(p+q).A similar but slightly different notation isbdiag(x1,x2)=(x100x2)∈R2×(p+q).We also present the following lemma for convenience of reference subsequently. The proof is straightforward and thus omitted.Lemma 2.1LetY=∑i=1NYibe compound Poisson with N ∼ Poisson(λ) and{Yi,i=1,2,…}a sequence of i.i.d vectors. For any partition{Aj,j=1,…,m}of the range of Yi,Tj:=∑i=1NYiIAj(Yi)=L∑k=1NjYjk,j=1,…,mare mutually independent and also compound Poisson withNj∼Poisson(λPr{Y1∈Aj})andYjk=LY1given Y1 ∈ Aj, where “=L” denotes equality in law (distribution).For anyr∈{0,1,…,J1},t∈{0,1,…,J2}andi∈{0,1,…,I},introduce the notationNirt=∑k=1ni∑l=1MikI{Rikl=r,Tikl=t}andYi:rt=∑k=1ni∑l=1MiktYiklI{Rikl=r,Tikl=t}. Under the model formulation, Lemma 2.1simply states thatC={(NirtYi:rt):r=0,1,…,J1,t=0,1,…,J2,i=0,1,…,I−r−t}is a block vector of independent compound Poisson components. Introduce next the statisticsRr=∑i=0I−r∑t=0J2Nirt,Yrt=∑i=0I−r−tYi:rt,Srt=∑i=0I−r−tNirt,Grt=∑i=0I−r−t∑l=tJ2Nirl.Estimators of the unknown parameters(λr,μr′,qr′)′,r=0,1,…,J1,are respectively given by(2.1)λ^r=Rre(r),μ^rt=YrtSrt,q^rt=c^rt∏s=0t−1(1−c^rs)andc^rt=SrtGrt.With the data structured in Section 2, the (incremental) payment in the jth development year of accident year i, the total outstanding liabilities in accident year i and for the whole portfolio are given respectively by(2.2)Xij=∑k=1ni∑l=1MikYiklI{Rikl+Tikl=j},Li=∑j=I−i+1JXijandL=∑i=1ILi.For every policy (i, k), the observations Riklare right truncated byI−iand the settlement delays Tiklare right censored byI−i−Riklfor those (i, k, l) withRikl≤I−i. The claim amounts Yiklare observed only on{Rikl+Tikl≤I−i}. Thus, the set of observations from a policy (i, k) isDik=⋃l=1Mik{(Rikl,Tikl∧(I−i−Rikl),I{Tikl≤I−i−Rikl}):Rikl≤I−i;Yikl:Rikl+Tikl≤I−i}and the dataset for the whole portfolio isD=⋃i=0I⋃k=1niDik.For the details of deriving the mathematical expressions below in the remainder of this section, please refer to Huang et al. (2015).Under mean squared error, the optimal predictor LIof L given the individual dataD,called the individual reserve, is(2.3)LI:=E[L|D]=∑r=0J1[(e(0)−e(r))λrμ˚r0+∑t=1J2NI−r−t+1,rRBNSμ˚rt],whereμ˚rt=∑s=tJ2qrsμrs∑l=tJ2qrlandNirRBNS=∑t=I−i−r+1J2Nirt.The individual loss reserving is thus obtained by replacing the unknown parameters in (2.3) with their estimates in (2.1), namely,L^I=E^[L|D]=∑r=0J1[(e(0)−e(r))λ^rμ˚^r0+∑t=1J2NI−r−t+1,rRBNSμ˚^rt],where with the convention of∏s=abxs=1for arbitrary xsif a > b,μ˚^rt=∑s=tJ2q^rsμ^rs∑s=tJ2q^rs=∑s=tJ2c^rsμ^rs∏l=0s−1(1−c^rl)∏l=0t−1(1−c^rl)=∑s=tJ2c^rsμ^rs∏l=ts−1(1−c^rl).Contrary to individual loss reserving, the available information for aggregate loss reserving (e.g., CL or BF method) is not the data setDbutAD={Xij:0≤j≤I−i,0≤i≤I},where Xijare given in (2.2). WriteCij=∑l=0jXilfor the accumulated payment of claims in accident year i up to development year j. Denote bysj=λE[YI{R+T≤j}]andvj=λE[Y2I{R+T≤j}],j=0,1,…,J,respectively the first two moments of the total payment up to development year j for the general representative (R, T, Y), which can be expressed assj=∑r=0j∧J1∑t=0(j−r)∧J2λrqrtμrtandvj=∑r=0j∧J1∑t=0(j−r)∧J2λrqrtυrt.Then,(1)it can be readily examined thatfj:=E[Ci,j+1]/E[Cij]=sj+1/sj,j=0,1,…,J−1,are independent of the accident yearsi=0,1,…,I;by Lemma 2.1, all Xijs are mutually independent withE[Xij]=φiγj,i,j=0,1,…,I,whereφi=eisJ,γ0=s0/sJandγj=(sj−sj−1)/sJ(j=1,…,I)satisfying∑j=0Jγj=1; andsimilarly, for every i,Var(Xi0)=eiv0andVar(Xij)=ei(vj−vj−1),j=1,2,…,I.Therefore, the aggregate loss reserve can be expressed asLA=E[L|AD]=E[Ci,I−i](∏j=I−iJ−1fj−1)=∑i=1Iφi(1−∏j=I−iJ−1fj−1).Accordingly, the CL loss reserving is(2.4)L^CL=∑i=1ICi,I−i(∏j=I−iJ−1f^j−1),wheref^j=1+∑i=0I−j−1Xi,j+1∑l=0j∑i=0I−j−1Xiland the BF reserving is(2.5)L^BF=∑i=1IeiC0e0(1−∏j=I−iJ−1f^j−1).Therefore, if sJis estimated bys^J=C0/e0,then the parameterφi=eisJ(the ultimate loss for accident year i) is estimated byφ^i=(ei/e0)Ci.This section consists of two parts. The first presents the asymptotic distributions of the individual loss reserving and the two aggregate loss reservings in three theorems. Roughly speaking, these theorems state that, asymptotically, the average loss reservings converge to the individual loss reserve atO(n)rate. It is however not easy to see a clear picture on which of the three loss reservings has the least asymptotic variance (or mean squared error). The second part then discusses the performance of the three loss reservings in terms of asymptotic variances, or equivalently, the mean squared errors between loss reservings and the individual loss reserve LI.The theorems below present the asymptotic distributions ofL^I,L^CLandL^BF,respectively. The proofs of these theorems are detailed in Section 4.Theorem 3.11/n(L^I−LI)→LN(0,σI2)as n → ∞, where(3.1)σI2=∑r=0J1λr{μ˚r02(e˘(0)−e˘(r))2e˘(r)+∑t=0J2qrt(e˘(0)−e˘(r+t))2e˘(r+t)×[(vrt−μrt2)+(1−crt)(μrt−μ˚r,t+1)2]}withμ˚r,J2+1=0.1/n(L^CL−LI)→LN(0,σCL2)as n → ∞, where(3.2)σCL2=∑i=0I∑j=0I−ie˘iɛij2(vj−vj−1)+∑r=0J1λr∑t=1J2qrtμ˚rt2crte˘I−r−t+1,and, forj=0,1,…,I−i,i=0,1,…,I,(3.3)ɛij=sJ−sI−isI−i+sJ(e˘(0)−e˘(j)sje˘(j)+∑l=jJ−i−1e˘(0)−e˘(l+1)e˘(l+1)sl−sl+1slsl+1),where∑i=ab(·)i=0if a > b.1/n(L^BF−LI)→LN(0,σBF2)as n → ∞, where(3.4)σBF2=∑i=0I∑j=0I−ie˘iχij2(vj−vj−1)+∑r=0J1λr∑t=1J2qrtμ˚rt2e˘I−r−t+1crtwithχ0j=∑l=1Ie˘l(sJ−sI−l)e˘0sJ+∑k=jJ−1sk−sk+1e˘(k+1)sk+1sk∑l=0ke˘I−lsl+1e˘(j)sj∑l=0j−1e˘I−lsl,j=0,1,…,I,andχij=∑k=jJ−i−1sk−sk+1e˘(k+1)sk+1sk∑l=0ke˘I−lsl+1e˘(j)sj∑l=0j−1e˘I−lsl,j=0,1,…,I−i,i>0.Though the forms of the asymptotic variances for individual, CL and BF reservings were derived, they are mathematically intricate and difficult to compare analytically in general. This section provides comparisons in two different ways: Section 3.2.1 presents certain comparisons of the asymptotic variances analytically under some specific settings, and in Section 3.2.2, we study how the three asymptotic variances vary over the changes of single parameters when the others are kept fixed so as to reveal the behaviors of the three loss reservings.Case I:J1=0,J2=1. By Theorem 3.1, the asymptotic variance forL^Iis(3.5)σI2=λq1e˘12e˘0(v1−u12).Using the weak convergencen(1n(X00X01X10)−(λe˘0q0u0λe˘0q1u1λe˘1q0u0))⟶LN(0,(λe˘0q0v0λe˘0q1v1λe˘1q0v0))and the expression for the CL reservingL^CL=f(X00,X01,X10)=X10X01/X00with∂f∂x1|x1=λe˘0q0u0,x2=λe˘0q1u1,x3=λe˘1q0u0=−λe˘1q0u0λe˘0q1u1(λe˘0q0u0)2=−e˘1q1u1e˘0q0u0,∂f∂x2|x1=λe˘0q0u0,x2=λe˘0q1u1,x3=λe˘1q0u0=λe˘1q0u01λe˘0q0u0=e˘1e˘0,∂f∂x3|x1=λe˘0q0u0,x2=λe˘0q1u1,x3=λe˘1q0u0=λe˘0q1u1λe˘0q0u0=q1u1q0u0,we obtain the asymptotic variance of the CL reserve asσCL.12=(−e˘1q1u1e˘0q0u0e˘1e˘0q1u1q0u0)×(λe˘0q0v0λe˘0q1v1λe˘1q0v0)(−e˘1q1u1/e˘0q0u0e˘1/e˘0q1u1/q0u0)=λe˘12q12u12e˘0q0u02v0+λq1v1e˘12e˘0+λe˘1q12u12q0u02v0=λq1e˘12e˘0(q1u12v0q0u02(1+e˘0e˘1)+v1).BecauseσIA2=λe˘1q1u12,the asymptotic variance for the CL reserving is(3.6)σCL2=σCL.12+σIA2=λq1e˘12e˘0(q1u12v0q0u02(1+e˘0e˘1)+v1+e˘0e˘1u12).For the BF reserving, we haveL^BF=(X00+X01)e1e0(1−X00X00+X01)=e1e0(X00+X01)X01X00+X01=e1e0X01.Consequently, noting thatσBF.12=(e˘12/e˘02)λe˘0q1v1=λq1(e˘12/e˘0v1),the asymptotic variance for the BF reserving is(3.7)σBF2=σBF.1+σIA2=λq1e˘12e˘0(v1+e˘0e˘1u12).CompareσI2in (3.5),σCL2in (3.6) andσBF2in (3.7), we can see a clear order relationship among the asymptotic variances of the three reservings:(3.8)σI2<σBF2<σCL2and the differences can be significant.Case II: A RBNS case:Consider the setting:J1=0,e˘i=e˘,qrt=q=1/(I+1),μrt=μ,vrt=vforr=0,t=0,1,…,I. HereJ1=0means a truly RBNS claims reserving. Now the asymptotic variance forL^IisσI2=λqe˘(v−u2)∑i=0Ii2I−i+1=λqe˘(v−u2)(I+1)2×[∑i=1I1i−3I2(I+1)].To compute the asymptotic variances of aggregate reservings, note thatsj=λqu(j+1)andvj=λqv(j+1),j=0,1,…,I,henceσIA2=∑r=0J1λr∑t=1J2qrtμ˚rt2crte˘I−r−t+1=e˘qμ˚2∑t=1I(I−t+1)=I(I+1)2e˘qμ2.Moreover, the terms εijin (3.3) areɛij=iI−i+1+λqμ(I+1)(j(I−j+1)(j+1)λqμ−∑k=jI−i−1k+1I−k1(k+1)(k+2)λqμ)=iI−i+1+(I+1)(j(I−j+1)(j+1)−∑k=jI−i−11(I−k)(k+2))and the terms χijin Theorem 3.3 reduce toχij=∑l=1IlI+1I{i=0}−∑k=jJ−i−1∑l=0k(l+1)(I−k)(k+1)(k+2)+∑l=1jl(I−j+1)(j+1)={I2+j2(I−j+1)−∑k=jI−i−112(I−k),ifi=0,j2(I−j+1)−∑k=jI−i−112(I−k),ifi>0.The asymptotic variancesσCL2andσBF2in this situation are thusσCL2=λe˘qv∑i=0I∑j=0I−iɛij2+I(I+1)2e˘qμ2andσBF2=λe˘qv∑i=0I∑j=0I−iχij2+I(I+1)2e˘qμ2,respectively. We list in Table 1below the expressions ofσI2,σCL2andσBF2(divided byλqe˘) as functions ofvand u, which shows that the orderσI2<σCL2<σBF2holds forI=2,3,…,10.We now compare the asymptotic variances by numerical computations for a few specified parameter values under the base setting:•λ=1,I=7,J1=3andJ2=4.Take the base values of the parameters for reporting delay, settlement delay and claim severity respectively asp0=(0.350.300.200.15)andQ0=(0.200.200.200.200.200.330.270.170.130.100.300.250.200.150.100.260.220.200.180.14).The base conditional means and coefficients of deviation of the claim severity are respectivelyU=(1.21.41.82.22.42.12.42.72.93.22.52.93.33.63.92.83.13.43.74.0)andCV0=(0.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.90.9).The asymptotic variances of the loss reserving are then computed in the following three groups of varying values of p, Q, U and CV:(a)First we retainQ=Q0,U=U0andCV=CV0as above and letp=(0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25)′+(−3d,−d,d,3d)′with d varying from -0.07 to 0.07. The curves of the corresponding asymptotic variances in d are drawn in Fig. 1(a), in which the vertical axe indicates the values of the asymptotic variancesσI2,σCL2andσBF2(respectively given by (3.1), (3.2) and (3.4)).Next, we keepp=p0,U=U0andCV=CV0as above and take each row of Q equal to(0.20−2d,0.20−d,0.20,0.20+d,0.20+2d),where d varied from−0.05to 0.05. The values of the asymptotic variances in d are presented in Fig. 1(b).Finally, we keepp=p0,Q=Q0andU=U0as above and letCV=d×CV0,where d takes values from 0.1 to 10. The values of the asymptotic variances in d are curved in Fig. 1(c).Fig. 1 clearly shows that, in all computed situations, the individual reservings have the smallest asymptotic variances, BF the intermediate and CL the biggest asymptotic variances.This section provides the details of the proofs of the three theorems in Section 3 on the asymptotic distributions of the loss reservings. Before the formal proofs, some necessary lemmas are prepared in Section 4.1. The proofs are separately presented in Sections 4.2–4.4.We first provide Lemma 4.1 on the asymptotic distributions of the normalized compound-Poisson distributed random vectors, whose proof is straightforward and thus omitted. Lemma 4.2 proves the asymptotic normality of the parameter estimators, which is needed in the proof of Theorem 3.1. The asymptotic distributions of the two aggregate reservings depend largely on the asymptotics of the aggregate payments Xijs, which are stated in Lemma 4.3 for reference.Lemma 4.1LetDn=(Dn1′,Dn2′,…,Dnm′)′be a block m-vector of independent compound-Poisson components Dnj withE[Dnj]=λnjμjandVar(Dnj)=λnjVj,j=1,2,…,m. If λn1→ ∞, λnj/λn1 → kj,j=2,…,m,andlimn→∞Var(AnDn)=Vfor a sequence of matrices An→ 0 as n → ∞, thenAn(Dn−E[Dn])→LN(0,V),where→Ldenotes convergence in distribution.The set of estimates{λ^r,μ^rt,c^rt:r=0,1,…,J1,t=0,1,…,J2}are asymptotically independent with limiting distributionsn(λ^r−λr)→LN(0,λr/e˘(r)),n(μ^rt−μrt)→LN(0,(υrt−μrt2)/λre˘(r+t)qrt)andn(c^rt−crt)→LN(0,crt2(1−crt)/λre˘(r+t)qrt).DenoteVrt=(Yrt,Srt,Grt)′. ThenE[Vrt]=e(r+t)γrtandVar(Vrt)=e(r+t)Γrt,whereγrt:=λrqrt(μrt11/crt)andΓrt:=λrqrt(υrtμrtμrtμrt11μrt11/crt).Since(Rr,Vr0′,Vr1′,…,VrJ2′)′is an affine transform ofCndefined in (2.1), by a simple computation of its covariance matrix, Lemma 4.1 implies that1n{(RrVr0⋮VrJ2)−(λre(r)e(r)γr0⋮e(r+J2)γrJ2)}→LN(0,Σr)whereΣr=(λre˘(r)e˘(r)γr0′…e˘(r+J2)γr,J2′e˘(r)γr0e˘(r)Γr0⋮⋱e˘(r+J2)γrJ2e˘(r+J2)ΓrJ2)with the blanks indicating zero blocks.Letf(x)=(x1/x2,x2/x3)′,wherex=(x1,x2,x3)′,such that(μ^rtc^rt)=f(Vrt/n),(μrtcrt)=f(e˘(r+t)γrt)and∂f(x)∂x′|x=e˘(r+t)γrt=1λre˘(r+t)qrt(ωrt′ϖrt′),r=0,1,…,J1,t=0,1,…,J2,withωrt=(1,−μrt,0)′andϖrt=(0,crt,−crt2)′.In view of the limitlimn→∞n−1e(r+t)γrt=e˘(r+t)γrt,the uniform delta method implies thatn(θ^r−θr)=n{(λ^rμ^rc^r)−(λrμrcr)}→LN(0,Σθ,r),where•Σθ,r=(1/e˘(r)Pθ1Pθ2)Σr(1/e˘(r)Pθ1Pθ2)′=(λr/e˘(r)000Σμ,r000Σc,r),Pθ1=1λrbdiag(ωr0′e˘(r)qr0,ωr1′e˘(r+1)qr1,…,ωrJ2′e˘(r+J2)qr,J2),Pθ2=1λrbdiag(ϖr0e˘(r)qr0′,ϖr1′e˘(r+1)qr1,…,ϖrJ2′e˘(r+J2)qr,J2),Σris the asymptotic covariance matrix in (4.1),Σμ,r=1λrdiag(υr0−μr02e˘(r+0)qr0,υr1−μr12e˘(r+1)qr0,…,υrJ2−μr,J22e˘(r+J2)qr,J2),andΣc,r=1λrdiag(cr02(1−cr0)e˘(r+0)qr0,cr12(1−cr1)e˘(r+1)qr1,…,crJ22(1−cr,J2)e˘(r+J2)qr,J2).Consequently, the proof is completed by referring to the independence among the random vectors(Rr,Vr0′,Vr1′,…,VrJ2′),r=0,1,…,J1.□Finally, letXi=(Xi0,Xi1,…,Xi,I−i)′,i=0,1,…,I,andX=(X0′,X1′,…,XI′)′,so that the mean and covariance matrix of X are given respectively byE[X]=(e0s0′Γ0′,e1s1′Γ1′,…,eIsI′ΓI′)′andVar(X)=diag(e0v0′Γ0′,e1v1′Γ1′,…,eIvI′ΓI′),wheresi=(s0,s1,…,sI−i)′,vi=(v0,v1,…,vI−i)′and the(I−i+1)×(I−i+1)matrix Γihas 1s on the diagonal,−1s on the subdiagonal and 0s elsewhere. A straightforward application of Lemma 4.1yields the following lemma.Lemma 4.3For the aggregate observationsX,1n(X−E[X])→LN(0,Σ˘X),whereΣ˘X=diag((e˘0v0′Γ0′,e˘1v1′Γ1′,…,e˘IvI′ΓI′)′).ProofNote the decomposition(4.1)1n(L^I−E[L|D])=∑r=0J11n{(e(0)−e(r))(λ^rμ˚^r0−λrμ˚rt)+∑t=1J2NI−i−r+1,rRBNS(μ˚^rt−μ˚rt)}=∑r=0J1{(e(0)−e(r))nμ˚^r0n(λ^r−λr)+Er′nn(μ˚^r−μ˚r)},whereEr=(λr(e(0)−e(r)),NI−r,rRBNS,NI−r−1,rRBNS,…,NJ1−r+1,rRBNS)′,μ˚r=(μ˚r0,μ˚r1,…,μ˚rJ2)′andμ˚^r=(μ˚^r0,μ˚^r1,…,μ˚^rJ2)′. By Lemma 4.2,(e(0)−e(r))nμ˚^r0n(λ^r−λr)→LN(0,(e˘(0)−e˘(r))2e˘(r)λrμ˚r02).Due to∑l=tJ2qrl=qrt/crt,it follows from Kolmogorov’s strong law of large numbers that(4.2)Ern⟶a.s.E˘r=λr(e˘(0)−e˘(r),e˘I−rqr1cr1,e˘I−r−1qr2cr2,…,e˘J1−r+1qr,J2cr,J2)′.For the asymptotic distribution of the second term in the most right hand side of (4.1), define a vector-valued functionf(x1,x2)=[(f0,f1,…,fJ2)(x1,x2)]′,wherexi=(xi0,xi1,…,xiJ2)′fori=1,2andft(x1,x2)=∑s=tJ2x1sx2s∏l=ts−1(1−x2l),t=0,1,…,J2,such thatft(μ^r′,c^r′)=μ˚^rt,ft(μr′,cr′)=μ˚rt. Then by the convergence of Er/nin (4.2), applications of Slutsky Theorem and delta method lead toEr′nn(μ˚^r−μ˚r)→LN(0,E˘r′Σμ˚,rE˘r),whereΣμ˚,r=(F1,F2)(Σμ,rΣc,r)(F1F2)withF1=∂ft(x1,x2)∂x1′|x1=μr,x2=crandF2=∂ft(x1,x2)∂x2′|x1=μr,x2=crTo computeΣμ˚,r,note that∂ft(x1,x2)∂x1l|x1=μr,x2=cr={qrlcrtqrt,ifl≥t0,otherwiseand∂ft(x1,x2)∂x2l|x1=μr,x2=cr={qrlcrtcrlqrt(μrl−μ˚r,l+1),ifl≥t,t<J20otherwise,or, in matrix symbols,F1=diag(cr0qr0,cr1qr1,…,cr,J2qrJ2)Γdiag(qr0,qr1,…,qr,J2),F2=F1·diag(μr0−μ˚r1cr0,μr1−μ˚r2cr1,…,μr,J2−1−μ˚r,J2cr,J2−1,0),where Γ is a(J2+1)×(J2+1)matrix with 0s at the entries below the diagonal line and 1s elsewhere. By some algebraic computations we obtainE˘r′Σμ˚,rE˘r=∑t=0J2qrt(e˘(0)−e˘(r+t))2e˘(r+t)×[(vrt−μrt2)+(1−crt)(μrt−μ˚r,t+1)2].Then the proof is completed by the asymptotic independence of the estimates in Lemma 4.2.□ProofBecause the CL reservingL^CLdepends only on the settled claims and the individual loss reserveE[L|D]is a function of numbers of RBNS (the reported but not settled) claims,L^CLis statistically independent ofE[L|D]by Lemma 2.1. Note the decomposition(4.3)1n(L^CL−E[L|D])=n(1nL^CL−μ˘L)−n(1nE[L|D]−μ˘L),whereμ˘L=∑i=1Ie˘i(sJ−sI−i)is the limit ofn−1E[L]. Apparently,the proof can be completed by the following two assertions.Assertion 1n(1nL^CL−μ˘L)→LN(0,σCL.12)withσCL.12=∑i=0I∑j=0I−ie˘iɛij2(vj−vj−1),where εijs are defined in(3.3).To prove this assertion, writeC=(C0,I,C1,I−1,…,CI,0)′,1i=(1,1,…,1)′∈RI−i+1,andx=(x0′,x1′,…,xI′)′withxi=(xi0,xi1,…,xi,I−i)′,i=0,1,…,I. Define a vector-valued functionh(x)=[(h10,h11,…,h1I,h20,h21,…,h2,J−1)(x)]′byh1i(x)=1i′xi=∑l=0I−ixil,i=0,1,…,Iandh2j(x)=1+∑k=0I−j−1xk,j+1∑l=0i∑k=0I−j−1xkl,j=0,1,…,J−1such thath(X/n)=(C′/n,f^′)′,wheref^=(f^0,f^1,…,f^J−1)′withf^jgiven by (2.4). As the convergence of eiimpliesn−1E[X]→μ˘X=(e˘0s0′Γ0′,e˘1s1′Γ1′,…,e˘IsI′ΓI′)′,we haveh(μ˘X)=(μ˘C′,f′)′,whereμ˘C=(e˘0sJ,e˘1sJ−1,…,e˘Is0)is equal to the limit ofn−1E[C]andf=(f0,f1,…,fJ−1)′withfj=sj+1/sj,j=0,1,…,J−1. Furthermore, because∂h1i(x)∂xkl|x=μ˘X={1,ifk=i,0≤l≤I−i0,otherwiseand∂h2j(x)∂xkl|x=μ˘X={sj−sj+1e˘(j+1)sj2,if0≤k≤I−j−1,0≤l≤j1e˘(j+1)sj,if0≤k≤I−j−1,l=j+10,otherwisethe uniform delta method leads to(4.4)n{(n−1Cf^)−(μ˘Cf)}→LN(0,ΣC,f),whereΣC,f=(M1′,M2′)′Σ˘X(M1′,M2′),M1=bdiag(10′,11′,…,1I′)andM2=(M20,M21,…,M2I)withM2i=(M2i00i×(I−i))andM2i0=(a0b0a1a1b1⋮⋮⋱⋱yaI−i−1aI−i−1…aI−i−1bI−i−1)∈RI×(I−i+1),aj=(sj−sj+1)/(e˘(j+1)sj2)andbj=1/e˘(j+1)sj.In matrix form, we can expressn(1nL^CL−μ˘L)=11′n{1n(C1,I−1(∏j=I−1J−1f^j−1)C2,I−2(∏j=I−2J−1f^j−1)⋮CI,I−I(∏j=0J−1f^j−1))−(e˘1(sJ−sJ−1)e˘2(sJ−sJ−2)⋮e˘I(sJ−s0))}.Forx=(x0,x1,…,xI)′andy=(y0,y1,…,yJ−1)′,define a vector-valued functiong(x,y)=[(g1,g2,…,gI)(x,y)]′withgi(x,y)=xi(∏j=I−iJ−1yj−1),i=1,2,…,I,so thatgi(1nC′,f^′)=1nCi,I−i(∏j=I−iJ−1f^j−1)andgi(μ˘C′,f′)=e˘i(sJ−sI−i),i=1,2,…,I.It then follows from the delta method thatn(1nL^CL−μ˘L)→LN(0,σCL.12)withσCL.12=11′(G1,G2)ΣC,f(G1′G2′)11,where ΣC, fis the asymptotic variance given by (4.4),G1=∂g(x,y)∂x′|x=μ˘C,y=fandG2=∂g(x,y)∂y′|x=μ˘C,y=f.Because∂gi(x,y)∂xl|x=μ˘C,y=f=(sJsI−i−1)I{l=i}and∂gi(x,y)∂yl|x=μ˘C,y=f=e˘isJslsl+1I{l≥I−i},it follows that, in matrix form,G1=sJ(0I×1,diag(1sI−1−1,1sI−2−1,…,1s0−1))andG2=sIdiag(e˘1,e˘2,…,e˘I)Δdiag(s0s1,s1s2,…,sI−1sI),where Δ is the I × I matrix with all elements above the anti-diagonal equal to zero and 1s elsewhere. Defineɛ=11′(G1,G2)(M1M2)=(ɛ0,ɛ2,…,ɛI)withɛi=(ɛi0,ɛi1,…,ɛi,I−i)∈RI−i+1fori=0,1,…,I. ThenσCL.12=11′(G1,G2)(M1M2)Σ˘X(M1′,M2′)(G1′G2′)11=ɛΣ˘Xɛ′and thus Assertion 1 is proved.Assertion 2n(1nE[L|D]−μ˘L)→LN(0,σIA2)withσIA2=∑r=0J1λr∑t=1J2qrtμ˚rt2crte˘I−r−t+1.Recall thatNirRBNS∼Poisson(λrei∑t=I−i−r+1J2qrt)and in accordance with (2.3), an alternative expression of E[L] isE[L]=E[E[L|D]]=∑r=0J1((e(0)−e(r))λrμ˚r0+∑t=1J2λreI−r−t+1μ˚rt∑s=tJ2qrs).Consequently, an equivalent transformation forμ˘Lcan be obtained byμ˘L=limn→∞1nE[L]=∑r=0J1((e˘(0)−e˘(r))λrμ˚r0+∑t=1J2λre˘I−r−t+1μ˚rt∑s=tJ2qrs).Then it follows that(4.5)n(1nE[L|D]−μ˘L)=∑r=0J1λrμ˚r0n[1n(e(0)−e(r))−(e˘(0)−e˘(r))]+∑r=0J1∑t=1J2μ˚rtn[1nNI−r−t+1,rRBNS−λre˘I−r−t+1∑s=tJ2qrs].The first term on the right hand side of (4.5) converges to zero by Assumption 2.1 (c). For the second term, sinceNI−r−t+1,rRBNSis Poisson distributed with meanλreI−r−t+1∑s=tJ2qrs,Lemma 4.1 implies thatn[1nNI−r−t+1,rRBNS−λre˘I−r−t+1∑s=tJ2qrs]→LN(0,λre˘I−r−t+1∑s=tJ2qrs).Assertion 2 is therefore proved by noting that∑s=tJ2qrs=qrt/crtand the independence amongNI−r−t+1,rRBNSs. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.2.□ProofWith a similar decomposition as in (4.3), we have(4.6)1n(L^BF−E[L|D])=n(1nL^BF−μ˘L)+n(1nE[L|D]−μ˘L).BecauseL^BFdefined by (2.5) also depends only on the settled claims, the two terms on the right hand side of (4.6) are independent. Hence by Assertion 2 in the proof of Theorem 3.2, it suffices to proven(1nL^BF−μ˘L)→LN(0,∑i=0I∑j=0I−ie˘iχij2(vj−vj−1)).In a matrix form, the quantityn(n−1L^BF−∑i=1Ie˘i(sJ−sJ−i))can be rewritten as(4.7)ς′n{ϱ−ϱ˘}+ϱn{1nC0,I(1−∏j=I−1J−1f^j−11−∏j=I−2J−1f^j−1⋮1−∏j=0J−1f^j−1)−(e˘0(sJ−sJ−1)e˘0(sJ−sJ−2)⋮e˘0(sJ−s0))},whereϱ=e0−1(e1,…,eI)′,ϱ˘=e˘0−1(e˘1,…,e˘I)′andς=e˘0(sJ−sI−1,sJ−sI−2,…,sJ−s0)′. The first term in (4.7)converges to zero by Assumption 2.1 (c).Define a function of variatesx=(x0,x1,…,xI)′andy=(y0,y1,…,yJ−1)′byh(x,y)=[(h1,h2,…,hI)(x,y)]′withhi(x,y)=x0(1−∏j=I−iJ−11yj),i=1,2,…,I,such thathi(1nC,f^)=1nC0,I(1−∏j=I−iJ−1f^j−1)andhi(μ˘C,f)=e˘0(sJ−sI−i).Then by the delta method,n(1nL^BF−μ˘L)→LN(0,[ϱ˘(H1,H2)]ΣC,f[ϱ˘(H1,H2)]′),where ΣC, fis the asymptotic covariance–variance matrix given by (4.4),H1=∂h(x,y)∂x′|x=μ˘C,y=fandH2=∂h(x,y)∂y′|x=μ˘C,y=f.Because∂hi(x,y)∂xk|x=μ˘C,y=f={sJ−sI−isJ,ifk=0,0,otherwise,and∂hi(x,y)∂yk|x=μ˘C,y=f={e˘0sI−isksk+1,ifI−i≤k≤J−1,0,otherwise,it follows thatH1=1sJ((sJ−sI−1,sJ−sI−2,…,sJ−s0)′,0I×I)andH2=e˘0diag(sI−1,sI−2,…,s0)Δdiag(s0s1,s1s2,…,sJ−1sJ).Defineχ=ϱ˘(H1,H2)(M1M2)=ϱ˘H1M1+ϱ˘H2M2=(χ0,χ1,…,χI),whereχ0=1e˘0sJ∑i=1Ie˘i(sJ−sI−i)10′+ϱ˘H2M20and for i > 0,χi=1e˘0sJ∑i=1Ie˘i(sJ−sI−i)01×(I−i+1)+ϱ˘H2M2i=ϱ˘H2M2i.For a fixed i,ϱ˘H2M2i=(s0s1∑i=00e˘I−isi,s1s2∑i=01e˘I−isi,…,sJ−1sJ∑i=0I−1e˘I−isi)M2i=(∑k=0J−i−1akϰk,∑k=1J−i−1akϰk,…,∑k=J−iJ−i−1akϰk)+(0,b0ϰ0,…,bJ−i−1ϰJ−i−1),whereϰk=(sk/sk+1)∑i=0ke˘I−isi.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper has so far studied the weak convergence of individual, CL and BF loss reservings deduced from the same individual data model discussed in Huang et al. (2015). As in Huang et al. (2015), we considered the case that a claim is paid only once at settlement, which enables us to demonstrate a clear picture on how much advantage one can gain from using individual data compared to the corresponding aggregate data in classical run-off triangle techniques.While the assumption of one-payment is sensible in many real insurance practices, such as motor vehicle insurance, property insurance and mortgage insurance, and the findings can find their direct applications, it is here mainly for a theoretically simplicity so that we can derive some mathematically tractable results. This simplification is generally necessary for theoretical research, at least for exploring unknown laws at a first-step, as done by quite a few researchers, see, for example, Martínez-Miranda, Nielsen, and Verrall (2012; 2013). One of the challenging future research topics would be to investigate models allowing multiple payments to each claim, which may arise in, for example, health insurance and income protection insurance.
