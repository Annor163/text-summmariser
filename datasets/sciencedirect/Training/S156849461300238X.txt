@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is increasingly applied to healthcare and medical research and applications. However, knowledge representation of pairwise reciprocal matrix is still dubious. This research discusses the related drawbacks, and recommends pairwise opposite matrix as the ideal alternative. Pairwise opposite matrix is the key foundation of Primitive Cognitive Network Process (P-CNP), which revises the AHP approach with practical changes. A medical decision treatment evaluation using AHP is revised by P-CNP with a step-by-step tutorial. Comparisons with AHP have been discussed. The proposed method could be a promising decision tool to replace AHP to share information among patients or/and doctors, and to evaluate therapies, medical treatments, health care technologies, medical resources, and healthcare policies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) [1–3] and Analytic Network Process (ANP) [4] are ones of the popular decision making tools. [5–7] comprehensively reviewed and classified numerous AHP/ANP's applications in various domains. Regarding the AHP applications to medical and health care, [5] reviewed fifty articles from 1981 to 2006, and classified them in seven categories: diagnosis, patient participation, therapy/treatment, organ transplantation, project and technology evaluation and selection, human resource planning, and health care evaluation and policy.AHP applications to health care and medical research are still growing. [8,9] demonstrated the tutorial review to promote applications of AHP in medical and healthcare decision making. [10] combined AHP and goal programming in strategic enterprise resource planning (ERP) in a health-care system. Many medical studies used plenty of questionnaires of AHP design to conduct empirical research to prioritize criteria. For example, [11,12] evaluated colorectal cancer. [13] prioritized a hierarchy of 12 user needs for computed tomography (CT) scanner. [14] elicited patient preferences for health technology assessment (HTA). [15] examined healthcare professionals’ assessments of risk factors. [16] prioritized multiple outcome measures of antidepressant drug treatment. [17] assessed the expanded national immunization programs (ENIPs) and evaluated two alternative health care policies in Korea. [18] conducted a case comparison of the fuzzy logic and AHP methods in the development of medical diagnosis system involving basic symptoms elicitation and analysis. [19] compared the performance of AHP and Conjoint Analysis (CA) in eliciting patient preferences for treatment alternatives for stroke rehabilitation. [20] determined the most appropriate method for construction of a sequential decision tree in the management of rectal cancer, using various patient-specific criteria and treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.[21] reviewed methodological developments of AHP in views of problem modeling, pairwise comparisons, judgment scales, derivation methods, consistency indices, incomplete matrix, synthesis of the weights, sensitivity analysis and group decisions. Some debates of the AHP can be found in [22–30].The core notion of AHP is the paired comparison using paired ratio scale and used in a pairwise reciprocal matrix. [31–33] indicated that the basic numerical definition of paired ratio scaleaij=wi/wjfor paired comparison inappropriately represents the perception and cognition of paired difference and potentially producing misapplications, and suggested the paired interval (or differential) scale,bij=vi−vj, which replaces paired ratio scale, as the basis for Primitive Cognitive Network Process (P-CNP), which is to distinguish from AHP. Table 1presents different terminologies to distinguish the Analytic Hierarchy/Network Process from proposed Cognitive Network Process, in order to avoid confusion of two methods. The Cognitive Hierarchy Process (or Primitive CNP) is the basic model of the CNP, whilst the Analytic Hierarchy Process is the basic model of the ANP.The word “cognitive” implies that CNP uses the paired interval scale in a native way to represent our perception of paired difference as the expert judgment using paired ratio scale in AHP is questionable. For instance, we can more easily determine the answer or have less chance of errors for the difference of two than the ratio of two. The word “cognitive” could refer to cognitive sciences domain for the paired comparisons, as human cognitions of paired comparisons on the basis of measurement scale, number system and arithmetic operations are open to discuss.The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the flaws of paired ratio scale and the advantages of paired interval scale. Section 3 illustrates the concept of the Primitive Cognitive Network Process. Section 4 presents an application to Dogbite Treatment Decision using P-CNP. Section 5 discusses the comparisons with AHP, and the conclusion is in Section 6.The knowledge representation of pairwise comparison consists of two parts: syntactic form and semantic form. The syntactic form is a sentence using linguistic words for paired comparison. The semantic form is the mathematical expression or numerical representation for the syntactic form of the paired comparison. The semantic form for the syntactic form in AHP is open for discussion.Definition of AHP's ratio scale is typically different from the ratio scale widely applied and defined in [34], as AHP's ratio scale does not have zero point. In order not to confuse with the conventional concept of ratio scale, the term “paired ratio scale” refers to the scale development using in the measurement of paired comparison of AHP, whilst paired interval/differential scale is used for CNP.An example of the differences of paired comparisons in paired ratio scale and paired interval scale can be referred to in Fig. 1. The weights of two persons, e.g. Peter and Jason, are compared. If Peter is 60kg and Jason is 61kg, we can say that Jason is slightly heavier than Peter by our observation. However, if Saaty's ratio scale is applied, this is another story. The statement that Jason is slightly heavier than Peter will be interpreted as the statement that Jason is 2 times as heavy as Peter (viz. Jason is 1 time heavier than Peter). It is ridiculous to distort the fact to the exaggerated expression. If Peter is 60kg and Jason is 70kg by our perception, Jason is much taller than Peter. For numerical representation of Saaty's ratio scale, Jason is 5 times or 7 times as heavy as Peter.There are various misleading examples. If Peter is 1.4m, Jason will be 2.8m if Jason is slightly higher than Peter (Jason is 1.5m in fact). Providing that Peter is 15 years old, Jason will be 30 years old if Jason is slightly older than Peter (Jason is 16 in fact). Providing that Peter's IQ is 120, Jason's will be 240 if Jason is slightly more intelligent than Peter (Jason's IQ is 123 in fact). [35] indicated the flaws of paired ratio scales for time and temperature due to absence of the absolute zeros.Whilst most applications use the paired ratio scale schema, 1, 2, …, 9, which appears to be the standard of the applications of the AHP, Saaty [3] mentioned that “When the elements being compared are closer together than indicated by the scale, one can use the scale 1.1, 1.2, …, 1.9. If still fine, one can use the appropriate percentage refinement”. However, such scale 1.1, 1.2, …, 1.9 is much difficult (or impossible unless all entries of the matrix are 1) to get a perfectly consistent matrix, and induces much higher chance for higher inconsistency, due to the transitive property (aik·akj=aij). For example, if a12·a23=1.1·1.2=1.32, no scale point 1.32 (but only 1.3) is for a13.It appears that Saaty's ratio scale does not represent the reality of the cognition of paired difference, and usually produces exaggerated results beyond our common sense. The paired interval scale is more appropriate in above cases. For example, in the case of Peter and Jason who are 60kg and 61kg respectively, the statement “Jason is 1kg heavier than Peter” matches with the statement “Jason is slightly heavier than Peter.”The perception of interval (or difference) of two objects is much more straightforward and native than the perception of the ratio of both. Operations of addition and subtraction are easier than the operations of multiplication and division, which are based on repeated additions and subtractions. In primary school, we learn addition and subtraction prior to multiplication and division. If we do not know addition and subtraction, it is impossible to understand multiplication and division. Usually if we do not memorize the simple multiplication table, we usually do not know how to perform multiplication and division quickly. Due to the invention of the calculator, many adults may use the calculator instead of the multiplication table in memory. Usually we do not call the multiplication table, linking with linguistic labels, for making comparison. Thus, addition and subtraction are straightforward and native for the comparison of two objects.It may be suggested that transformation fromaij=wi/wjtolnaij=lnwi−lnwj, which looks equivalent tobij=vi−vj. Such claim that the paired interval scale can be formed from paired ratio scale is misleading for two reasons. For one reason, the concepts of paired ratio scale and paired interval scale are completely different. Whenaij=wi/wjis taken by a logarithm function, the scale aij=1, 2, …, 9 is distorted by the logarithm function as well, i.e. lnaij=ln1, …, ln9, which is definitely not equivalent to bij=0, …, 8. For example, “Object A is 8 units more than Object B” does not means “Object A is 2980 (ln−1(8)=e8) times as many as Object B.” Such suggestion completely dissociates mathematical form from the human cognition.For another reason, the result is recovered after anti-logarithm operation. For example, if Peter is 1.4m (known), and Jason is 1.5m (unknown), then Jason is slightly taller than Peter by our observation. Regarding the transformation form, the semantic form means that “the logarithm value of the height of Jason is 0.6899 (ln1.4−ln1.5) more than Peter”. With judgment using the logarithm proposal, Jason iswi=ln−1(lnaij+lnwj)=ln−1(ln2+ln1.4)=2.9m. This ridiculous result has no difference from the pure ratio one, but much more complicated to be understood and to be computed. Thus logarithm of paired ratio scale does not lead to paired interval scale. Section 5 discusses this issue further after Sections 4 and 5 introduce the related computational concepts.The Cognitive Network Process is the cognitive architecture which comprises five cognitive decision processes: the Problem Cognition Process (PCP), Cognitive Assessment Process (CAP), Cognitive Prioritization Process (CPP), Multiple Information Fusion Processes (MIP), and Decisional Volition Process (DVP).Problem Cognition Process is to formulate the Decision Problem as the measurable Structural Assessment Network (SAN) (Fig. 2), which comprises four units: an objective O, which is one sentence statement expressing the desired goal of the decision maker; a criteria structure (or structural criteria) C with a set of alternatives T=[T1, …, Ti, …, Tm] using a measurement scale schema(ℵ,X¯). The questionnaire is developed according to the design of SAN.Regarding measurement scale schema, let ℵ be the space of linguistic labels of the paired interval scales such as {Equally, Slightly, …, Absolutely} and the opposite of the set. The numerical representationX¯of paired interval scales for differential comparison is in the following form:(1)X¯=αi=iκτ|∀i∈{−τ,…,−1,0,1,…,τ},κ>0κ (read kappa) is the normal utility, which is the mean of the individual utility values of the comparison objects, and κ>0; by default setting,Max(X¯)=κ, especially if the mean of the individual utility values of the comparison objects or the scale sense is unknown. κ indicates how people perceive the difference value of paired objects in different scenarios. 2τ+1 is the number of the intervals in the scale schema. τ+1 usually uses 7±2 scale items in a rating process. An example of(ℵ,X¯)is the default setting is shown in Table 2. Advantage of such definition associated with normalization function is discussed in step 3. The definition for rating scale could be disassociated from κ, especially when detailed information is provided.In the Cognitive Assessment Process, the survey is conducted. A list of the Pairwise Opposite Matrices (POMs) is formed according to assessment result of the questionnaire yielded by the decision makers (or raters). The Accordance Index checks the validity of each POM.The Pairwise Opposite Matrix (POM) is used to interpret the individual utilities of the candidates. Let an ideal utility set beV={v1,…,vn}, and the comparison score bebij≅vi−vj. The ideal pairwise opposite matrix isB˜=[vi−vj]. A subjective judgmental pairwise opposite matrix using paired interval scales is B=[bij].B˜is determined by B as follows:(2)B˜=[b˜ij]=0v1−v2…v1−vnv2−v10…v2−vn⋮⋮⋱⋮vn−v1vn−v2⋯0≅0b12…b1nb210…b2n⋮⋮⋱⋮bn1bn2⋯0=[bij]=BWhen i=j,bij=vi−vj=0. [bij] is given by an expert, andbij∈X¯. The expert only fills an upper triangular matrix of the following form:(3)B+=biji<j0otherwise,orwrittenexplicitly,B+=0b12…b1n00…b2n⋮⋮⋱⋮00⋯0The lower triangular matrix is given by the opposite of an upper triangular matrix such that bij=−bji, and has the below form:(4)B−=biji>j0otherwise,orwrittenexplicitly,B−=00…0b210…0⋮⋮⋱⋮bn1bn2⋯0[bij] is achieved by B=B++B−. A complete POM needs n(n−1)/2 ratings. B is validated by the Accordance Index (AI) of the following form:(5)AI=1n2∑i=1n∑j=1ndij,wheredij=Mean1κ(Bi+BjT−bij)2where AI≥0, and κ is the normal utility, Biis the row vector of B,BjTis the row vector of BTor column vector of B. If AI=0, then B is perfectly accordant, i.e.B˜≡B; if 0<AI≤0.1, then B is satisfactory. If AI>0.1, then B is unsatisfactory.A remark is that there was a careless typo for the presentation of AI form in [31–33] which wasAI=(1/n2)∑i=1n∑j=1ndij. Form (5) computes the average of root mean square errors. The square root in [31–33] should not be needed again. However, the AI results of examples in [31–33] corresponds to form (5), as the computational algorithm has been implemented in the computer program. Form (5) can explicitly be written in below format.(6)AI=1n2∑i=1n∑j=1n1n∑p=1n(bip+bpj−bij)κ2During computation steps, the above form is not convenient to have clear view shown in Table 5for any discordant location.In the Cognitive Prioritization Process, each pairwise opposite matrix B is prioritized to the priority vector W, i.e. ψ:B→V, where ψ is cognitive prioritization operator. Two methods are chosen in [31–33]: Primitive Least Squares (PLS) (or Row Average plus the normal Utility (RAU)) and Least Penalty Squares (LPS), specified as follows.The vector of individual utilities can be derived by the Primitive Least Squares optimization model of B which is of the following form:(7)PLS(B+,κ)=MinΔ¯=∑i=1n∑j=i+1n(bij−vi+vj)2s.t.∑i=1nvi=nκ,wheren=|{vi}|, and κ is the normal utility.The closed form solution can be solved manually and is the Row Average plus the normal Utility (RAU), given by:(8)RAU(B,κ)=vi:vi=1n∑j=1nbij+κ,∀i∈{1,…,n}If∃vi∈Vis less than 0, κ can be increased such thatvi≥0,∀vi∈V, or the Least Penalty Squares (LPS) operator is applied as an alternative, as follows:LPS(B+,κ)=MinΔ⌢=∑i=1n∑j=i+1nβij⋅(bij−vi+vj)2(9)βij=β1,vi>vj&bij>0orvi<vj&bij<0β2,vi=vj&bij≠0orvi≠vj&bij=0β3,otherwise,1=β1≤β2≤β3s.t.∑i=1nvi=nκ,vi≥0,i=1,2,…,n,n=vi, and κ is the normal utility.For the most decision problems, summation of the prioritiesW={w1,…,wn}is equal to one, i.e.∑i=1nwi=1. W is said to be a normalized priority vector (or a priority vector in short). In order to use the proposed methods, the individual utility vector is rescaled (or normalized) as a normalized priority vector by the rescale function or the normalization function of the below form.(10)W=wi:wi=νinκ,∀i∈{1,…,n},which∑i∈{1,…,n}νi=nκW is the special case of V such that nκ=1.The advantage of normalization is that the normalized priority vectors and final normalized aggregation results in latter stage are the same whatever positive κ is chosen once κ is associated with the paired interval scale in the format of Table 2. The disadvantage is that more compared objects produce less priority values, as all objects share the only one unit, and ultimately the differences among objects are very small. AHP also has such disadvantage.Let V′ be a vector of criteria weights derived by a POM, and {V} be a matrix of corresponding priorities derived by a list of POMs. Information Fusion Process is the function to aggregate a priority pair (V′, {V}) to a result set Y by an aggregation operator, i.e. AO:(V′, {V})→Y, such that the number of V′ is the same as the number of the vectors of {V}. Multiple Information Fusion Process is the process to aggregate a list of hierarchical priority pairs {Y} to a vector of the objective priorities (or global priorities) T according to the Structural Access Network by an aggregation operator, i.e. AO:{Y}→T. Due to the popularity, simplicity, and efficiency, the weighted arithmetic mean is chosen as default AO.(11)wam(V′,V)=∑i=1nv′iviWhilst the evaluation involves a group of raters, aggregation of each rater is also performed in this stage. Aggregation of each individual priority vector of each rater is the recommended method.The Decisional Volition Process is the process to decide the final decision t∗∈T=[T1, …, Tm] with respect to the aggregation results by a volition function VL:T→t∗. The best alternative conventionally is determined by the highest score T∗=Max(T), and its position γ is returned by the argument of the maximum function arg max.(12)t∗=VL(T)=Tγ,whereγ=argmaxi∈{1,2,…,m}({T1,T2,…,Ti,…,Tm})The above form is used for the selection problem for one alternative. If more alternatives are needed, sorting algorithms are used to find a list the best candidates. The aggregation results or mere prioritization results could be used as ones of parameters for some specific functions.According to the literature review in Section 1, many studies applying AHP to the medical and health care research and applications. Most studies used pairwise reciprocal matrices of AHP as quantitative research to measure the weights of criteria, but a few studies presented the data of pairwise reciprocal matrices. The early study [8] illustrated a tutorial applying AHP to a clinical decision making problem regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics in the treatment of a patient who has a dogbite wound. As [8] was the early introduction of AHP to medical decision and the expert judgment data were presented, this paper adopts the Dogbite Treatment Decision problem from [8] as background, revises it by using P-CNP, and presents the proposed approach step by step from laymen perspective.The measurable Structural Assessment Network (SAN) is reproduced from [8] and presented in Fig. 3. The objective is to choose the best treatment for uncomplicated dogbite wound. Three factors are used for the treatment selection: to minimize wound infections, to minimize side effects, and to minimize treatment cost. Three treatment alternatives are proposed: Dicloxacillin Prophylaxis, Penicillin Prophylaxis, and no Prophylaxis. The rating scale schema in Table 2 is applied, and κ is set to be 8. The formats of survey questions with judgment data are presented in the next step.A clinical expert fills the survey shown in Figs. 4–7. For tutorial purpose, Figs. 4–7 demonstrate different formats of the question designs. In real practice, a unified format is recommended in order to simplify raters’ cognitions for the questions. The rating scores are converted from the pairwise reciprocal matrices presented in Table A1 of appendix adopted from [8]. The numerical conversion among two rating scale schema is presented in Table 3. Although the linguistic labels proposed in this research are different from [8], understanding of the magnitudes of ordinal scales should have no difference, but the meanings of the numerical systems for rater's cognition of paired difference are completely different.Once the survey is completed by the expert, POMs are formed and presented in Table 4. For example, the survey of Fig. 4 corresponds to the upper triangular matrix of B0 in Table 4, and the lower triangular matrix in B0 is given by the opposite of the upper triangular matrix such that bij=−bji. Similarly, Figs. 5–7 correspond to the upper triangular matrices of B1, B2, and B3 in Table 4.Accordance Index (AI) is used to check validity of a POM. In Table 4, B0, B1 and B2 are perfectly accordant. B3 is not perfectly accordant, but within the acceptable range. The demonstration to compute AI of B3 using form (5) is presented in Table 5. In the column ofBi+BjT−bij, if AI of a POM is perfectly accordant, all elements in the vectors of this column are equal to zero. Thus B3 is chosen as demonstration in Table 5. The number of non-zero elements means the number of contractions or discordance in the matrices. dijcomputes the root mean square error caused by a single entry bijof POM, and AI computes the average error of all entries. Although diiis always equal to zero, diiis regarded as an element in population and included for the average error calculation.As AI values of all POMs are acceptable, RAU can be used next. The prioritization results of all POMs are shown in Table 7. Table 6shows the steps to compute the priority set from B0 using RAU of forms (8) and (10). The final result is the normalization of the row average plus κ. The sum of the row average values, viz.(1/n)∑j=1nbij,i=1,…,n, is zero-sum value, as the sum of all elements of POM is equal to zero, which the related proof can be referred to in [31,33]. Usually negative prioritization results are not used until the case is specified. The row arithmetic mean (or row average) of the POM could be regarded as a distribution method. κ is the normal utility that is the average value for each object. Such value can be called as priority, weight, utility, importance and so on. Object of more weight has more positive values getting from the object of less weight. The total value of all objects is nκ. Once κ is associated with the paired interval scale in the format of Table 2, whatever positive κ yields the same normalized prioritization result set {wi}. If κ is disassociated with the paired interval scale, normalized prioritization result depends on the values of both κ and rating scales schema.Once the prioritization results are derived, aggregation is performed, and leads to rank results. Table 7 summarizes the details. Regarding the computational details, the objective priority of T1 is 0.42×0.31+0.33×0.22+0.25×0.40=0.30. The objective priorities of T2 and T3, which are computed in similar way, are 0.33 and 0.37. The closeness of preference results among three alternatives implies that the difficulty in making treatment decision, and thus the decision tool is needed. Although the aggregated preference value of “no Prophylaxis” (T3) is marginally higher than the others, T3 is the best choice for the patient who has a dogbite wound.The results from AHP are presented in Table 8. P-CNP recommends “no Prophylaxis” (T3) (Table 7) with a slightly higher preference value (viz. 0.37) than the other treatments (viz. 0.30 and 0.33), but AHP suggests Penicillin Prophylaxis (T2) treatment with distinct preference value (viz. 0.5) over the other alternatives (viz. 0.2 and 0.3).The aggregation values among three alternative treatments by P-CNP are much closer than AHP (Tables 7 and 8) due to the critical reason that the paired ratio scales usually exaggerate the human perception of the paired difference in times, and result in much wider variance. Section 2 has discussed such exaggerated issues induced by paired ratio scale. That is the lowest one has much lower value whilst the highest one has much higher value (see Fig. 1). Thus the paired ratio scale of AHP to represent the perception of difference of two objects is dubious.Whilst the objective priorities among three alternatives by P-CNP are much closer than AHP, P-CNP reflects the decision problem is difficult to make recommendation, but AHP reflects the decision problem is trivial. If the expert thinks C1 is very important (0.64) and T2 has distinct value (0.73) over the others with respect to this factor, T2 can be chosen without any complex decision process. In fact, if the candidate is obviously very strong, selection process using any decision tool is redundant and just wastes time, as the expert can make decision immediately. The necessary selection process in SAN should be needed when it is difficult to make decision due to uncertainty, insufficient information and knowledge, or/and similar strengths among alternatives. In this case, the distinct priority values of AHP unlikely reflect the fact that the decision is difficult to make to select the best one from three alternatives, but reflect that using decision tool may be redundant.Both pairwise reciprocal matrix (PRM) and pairwise opposite matrix (POM) use the same syntactic form, but different semantic forms, which lead to different Consistency/Accordance issues. Section 2 uses various examples to demonstrate flaws for using paired ratio scale as sematic representation. It could often be the case that the expert produces practical consistent/accordant rating; however, due to AHP's sematic misrepresentation, AHP tells the users the rating is inconsistent, and may require the decision maker to rate again. In the application of [8], A0 and A1 (Table A1 of appendix) were mistakenly interpreted as inconsistent evaluations, whilst their semantic forms (B0 and B1) are perfectly accordant in views of P-CNP.Section 2 has discussed logarithm of paired ratio scale is not paired interval scale. To extend, logarithm of pairwise reciprocal matrix are definitely not pairwise opposite matrix, regarding the original rating sense and artificial prioritization results. The claim is thataij=wi/wjis transformed tolnaij=lnwi−lnwj, which looks equivalent tobij=vi−vjsuch that bij=lnaij,vi=lnwi, andvj=lnwj; or aij=ebij,wi=evi,wj=evj; A=(aij)=exp(B)=(ebij). Such claim, however, completely make no sense. For example, according to such claim, B0 (in Table 4) could be converted as the below form.exp(B0)=e0e2e4e−2e0e2e−4e−2e0=17.3954.600.1417.390.020.141=A′0The above PRM can typically be solved by eigenvector method. To easily understand the claim, it can be solved by Normalization of Geometric Means of Rows (NGMR) as below.(13)w′i=∏j=1naij1/n,i=1,2,…,n(14)wi=w′i∑i=1nw′i,i=1,2,…,nHowever, the solution for the new PRM, exp(B0) orA′0is (0.87, 0.12, 0.02), which is completely different from (0.42, 0.33, 0.25) derived from POM, B0, in Table 6. To take a close look of the conversion,(15)w′i=∏j=1naij1/n=∏j=1nebij1/n=e(1/n)∑j=1nbij=exp1n∑j=1nbij,i=1,2,…,nThe solution difference is mainly due to the reason that anti-logarithm operation or exponential function (viz. exp(.)) is used for the average of paired interval scores in a row.For the another reason of the difference, the normal utility κ is not included inexp((1/n)∑j=1nbij), but has no impact to the normalized prioritization result after form (14) is taken. Conversely, as demonstrated in Table 6, κ is needed for the RAU prioritization as the paired interval scale is associated with κ in this research (the benefit has been discussed earlier).In addition, the rating scores in the survey interface and according to the PRMA′0are completely different from the original ones shown in Fig. 4. Especially, the entry of 54.6 of the PRMA′0is completely non-sense as there is no such rating option in the survey interface. POM and PRM, therefore, are two completely identical systems.Finally, whilst there are a number of problems for AHP, why does AHP appear to be corrected? All potential alternatives are screened in advance to meet the basic requirements before they are included in the AHP tree for the further evaluation and selection processes. In other words, the unsatisfied or unrelated alternatives/factors are directly excluded for consideration in early stage. Although the best one may not be selected, at least the suitable one is selected to fulfill the tasks. No further valid measurement could be made to reflect the AHP decision.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Whilst there are increasing medical and healthcare research and applications using AHP, in addition to the other applications domains, this research discusses the defects of AHP, and proposed the better alternative, P-CNP. The AHP's Pairwise Reciprocal Matrix (PRM) for paired comparisons appears to be inappropriate or is open to discuss. PRM is based on paired ratio scales. It is questionable that the cognitive comparison of two objects can be represented by their ratio since human subjective judgment is unlikely to use multiplication or division for the difference. This research proposes a Pairwise Opposite Matrix (POM) where the cognitive comparison between two objects is represented by the native paired difference between both objects, rather than paired ratio. The perception of the linguistic terms should be paired interval scale rather than paired ratio scale with better matching our natural language. Development of P-CNP is based on the POM.Dogbite Treatment Decision using AHP [8] is revised by P-CNP with a step-by-step tutorial demonstration. Shortcomings of AHP and the gap bridge are presented. The proposed method should be the promising alternative of AHP to medical and healthcare research and applications such as therapies, medical treatments, health care technologies, medical resources, and healthcare policies.As the fuzzy number can be used in both paired ratio scale and paired interval scale, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) [36–40] and Fuzzy Cognitive Network Process (F-CNP) [41] are formed respectively. One of the future study directions is to apply the F-CNP to medical and healthcare research and applications, with comparing the F-AHP.
