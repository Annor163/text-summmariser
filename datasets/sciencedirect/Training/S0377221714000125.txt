There is no overestimate in Cook and Zhu (2007) and Toloo (2009) models.The obtained efficiency by Cook and Zhu (2007) and Toloo (2009) is always equal to a CCR result.We illustrate that there is a scale of data such that Toloo’s model is always feasible.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Cook and Zhu (2007) introduced an innovative method to deal with flexible measures. Toloo (2009) found a computational problem in their approach and tackled this issue. Amirteimoori and Emrouznejad (2012) claimed that both Cook and Zhu (2007) and Toloo (2009) models overestimate the efficiency. In this response, we prove that their claim is incorrect and there is no overestimate in these approaches.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Suppose there are n decision making units (DMUs), DMUj j=1,…,n, with m inputs xj=(x1j,…,xmj), s outputs yj=(y1j,…,ysj) and L flexible measures wj=(w1j,…,wLj). Cook and Zhu (2007) proposed the following classifier model to determine the status of flexible measures:(1)maxe¯o=∑r=1sμryro+∑l=1Lδlωlos.t.∑i=1mυixio+∑l=1Lγlωlo-∑l=1Lδlωlo=1∑r=1sμryrj+2∑l=1Lδlωlj-∑i=1mυixij-∑l=1Lγlωlj⩽0j=1,2,…,n0⩽δl⩽Mdlδl⩽γl⩽δl+M(1-dl)dl∈{0,1},δl,γl⩾0∀lμr,υi⩾0∀r,iwhere M is a large positive number. Toloo (2009) indicated that classifier model (1) might misestimate the efficiency score with an unsuitable value of M and, to tackle this issue, utilized units invariance property and suggested the following model that does not need such a large positive number:(2)max∑r=1sμryro+∑l=1Lδlωlos.t.∑i=1mυixio+∑l=1Lγlωlo-∑l=1Lδlωlo=1∑r=1sμryrj+2∑l=1Lδlωlj-∑i=1mυixij-∑l=1Lγlωlj⩽0j=1,2,…,n0⩽δl⩽dlδl⩽γl⩽δl+(1-dl)dl∈{0,1},0⩽δl,γl⩽1∀l0⩽μr,υi⩽1∀r,iToloo (2009) stated and proved that there exists a scale of data such that two classifier models (1) and (2) are equivalent.Amirteimoori and Emrouznejad (2012) used a numerical example where all data is less than 1, to show that in many real cases model (2) is infeasible. Table 1displays the data with single input (x), single output (y) and single flexible measure (z).In addition, they claimed that (1) and (2) are very optimistic models and always overestimate the efficiency. Amirteimoori and Emrouznejad (2012) also claimed thate¯o∗⩾e⌣o∗ande¯o∗⩾e⌢o∗, wheree⌣o∗ande⌢o∗are the optimal objective value of the following models (3) and (4), respectively:(3)maxe⌣o=∑r=1sμryros.t.∑i=1mυixio+∑l=1Lγlωlo=1∑r=1sμryrj-∑i=1mυixij-∑l=1Lγlωlj⩽0j=1,2,…,nμr,υi,γl⩾0∀r,i,l(4)maxe⌢o=∑r=1sμryro+∑l=1Lδlωlos.t.∑i=1mυixio=1∑r=1sμryrj+∑l=1Lδlωlj-∑i=1mυixij⩽0j=1,2,…,nμr,υi,δl⩾0∀r,i,lModel (3) is a CCR model assuming all flexible measures as inputs and model (4) is a CCR model assuming all flexible measures as outputs. With these assumptions, Amirteimoori and Emrouznejad (2012) concluded that there is an overestimate which can be considered as a drawback from Cook and Zhu (2007) and Toloo (2009) models. More importantly, they also claimed that both models produce very high efficiencies, always greater than those of the CCR results when a flexible measure is considered as an input or those of the CCR results when it is included as an output.Nevertheless the obtained results in Table 1 is correct, Toloo (2009) did not claim that model (2) is always feasible for all data types. He proved that there is a scale of data that model (2) is equivalent to model (1) which is always feasible. As it is stated and proved in subcase B1 of Lemma 2 (see Toloo, 2009), we can use the following change of variable to obtain a suitable scale of data:x¯ij=xijminj{xij>0}=xij0.031y¯rj=yrjminj{yij>0}=yrj0.002318w¯lj=wljminj{wlj>0}=wlj0.0022803Table 1 exhibits the required scale of data, the efficiency score when w is considered as input (model 3), the efficiency score when w is considered as output (model 4), and the efficiency score of feasible model (2).As can be seen form Table 2we havee¯o∗=max{e⌣o∗,e⌢o∗}and there is no overestimate in this numerical example. In addition, DMU3 is efficient if we consider w as input which shows some computational errors are made in Amirteimoori and Emrouznejad (2012).In general, there are 2Lvarious combinations for L flexible measures. Letek∗(k=1,2,…,2L)be the obtained CCR-efficiency for each combination. Amirteimoori and Emrouznejad (2012) considered 2 out of 2Lvarious status for L flexible measures, i.e. models (3) and (4), and concluded that there is an overestimate in models (1) and (2), but we are going to consider all possible combinations to prove that there is no overestimate in these models. Unlike Amirteimoori and Emrouznejad’s claim, we prove that the obtained efficiency by Cook and Zhu (2007) and Toloo (2009) is always equal to a CCR result.Theorem 1e¯o∗=max{ek∗:k=1,2,…,2L}.Let(μr∗,υi∗,δl∗,γl∗,dl∗)be the optimal solution of model (1) andI={l:dl∗=0}. Consider the following model:(5)maxe=∑r=1suryro+∑l∉Iu¯lωlos.t.∑i=1mvixio+∑l∈Iv¯lωlo=1∑r=1suryrj+∑l∉Iu¯lωlj-∑i=1mνixij-∑l∈Iv¯lωlj⩽0j=1,2,…,nur,u¯l,νi,v¯l⩾0∀r,i,lLet(ur∗,vi∗,u¯l∗,v¯l∗)be the optimal solution of model (5). As inspection makes clear, we have∀r,ur∗=μr∗,∀i,vi∗=υi∗,∀l∉I,u¯l∗=δl∗and∀l∈I,v¯l∗=γl∗which implye¯o∗=e∗. Note that (5) is the CCR model when we consider∀l∈I,ωlas input and also∀l∉I,ωlas output. Hence, we have proved thate¯o∗∈{e1∗,e2∗,…,e2L∗}and what is left is to show thate¯o∗={e1∗,e2∗,…,e2L∗}. Letep∗=max{e1∗,e2∗,…,e2L∗}and contrary to our claim,e¯o∗<ep∗. There is no loos of generality in assuming that the following CCR model obtainsep∗:(6)maxep=∑r=1suryro+∑l∈OUTu¯lωlos.t.∑i=1mvixio+∑l∈INv¯lωlo=1∑r=1suryrj+∑l∈OUTu¯lωlj-∑i=1mνixij-∑l∈INv¯lωlj⩽0j=1,2,…,nur,u¯l,νi,v¯l⩾0∀r,i,lApparently,(μ¯r∗,υ¯i∗,δ¯l∗,γ¯l∗,d¯l∗)is a feasible solution of model (1) where∀r,μ¯r∗=ur∗,∀i,υ¯i∗=vi∗,δ¯l∗=u¯l∗ifl∈OUT0otherwise,γ¯l∗=v¯l∗ifl∈IN0otherwise,d¯l∗=1ifl∈OUT0otherwiseThe objective value of this feasible solution,ep∗, is larger than the optimal objective function,e¯o∗, which is a contradiction.□Theorem 1 proves that the proposed models in Cook and Zhu (2007) and Toloo (2009) correctly determine the status of flexible measures with no overestimate when we consider all possible combinations. The theorem also ensures that there is always an obtained CCR result by applying Cook and Zhu (2007) and Toloo (2009) models.
