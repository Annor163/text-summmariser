Mitigating effect of Avicenna marina on indomethacin induced gastric ulcer in male albino rats

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The ulcerogenic effect of indomethacin on gastric wall was studied.Pre-administration with Avicenna marina protects the gastric wall against indomethacin effect.The anti-ulcer effect of Avicenna marina may be attributed to the presence of polyphenols.The effect of Avicenna marina on inflammatory markers and prostaglandin was studied.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aqueous extract of Avicenna marina (AM) has been suggested to be useful in the treatment of various diseases. In this study, the protective effect of oral administration of Avicenna marina extract against oxidative gastric mucosal injury induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), indomethacin in rats was investigated. The aqueous extract of Avicenna marina was given by oral gavages (125 mg /kg) three times at 12 h intervals before administering indomethacin (20 mg/kg). The level of prostaglandin (PGE2) and pH gradient were markedly decreased following indomethacin treatment, with increase in acid volume. In addition, tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly increased 6 h after oral administration of indomethacin in rats gastric mucosa indicating acute inflammatory injury. Pretreatment with AM abolished indomethacin induced elevation of TNF-α, TGF-β1 and MAD levels. In indomethacin-treated rats, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities as well as reduced glutathione (GSH) content were significantly diminished in gastric mucosa. However, pre-administration with AM maintains the level of these parameters near to the control value. Thus, these results indicate the effective anti-peroxidative and preventive actions of AM against indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal damage.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Harmful effects of toxic factors such as alcohol, bile salts, and hydrochloric acids are prevented by biological structures within the stomach. This high resistance to injuries relies on a number of physiological responses evoked by the mucosal lining against potentially harmful luminal agents, as well as the ability of rapidly repairing the mucosal damage after it occurs [1]. On the other hand, these protective mechanisms might be overcome by injurious factors and a gastric mucosal lesion may develop. Most of the deleterious effects on gastric mucosa are caused by nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are considered one of the largely used pharmaceutical agents worldwide [2]. NSAIDs produce both helpful and antagonistic impacts fundamentally by hindering cyclooxygenase (COX) and subsequently diminishing the production of thromboxanes and prostaglandins, which are the mediators that signal inflammation and pain as well as mediating the physiological functions [3].Indomethacin, which is a part of the NSAIDs family, activates polymorphonuclear granules and induce gastrointestinal damage in both animals and humans [4,5]. These kinds of pathologies are usually primarily due to damage of the mucosal cell membranes. Previously, reports have shown that the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is not the only mechanism responsible for gastric damage induced by indomethacin [6]. Also, indomethacin might act like a pro-oxidant catalytic and also initiate LPO by producing ROS, thereby interfering with the endogenous antioxidant systems of any mucosal cells [7].Avicenna marina is a mangrove plant known as gray mangrove tree belonging to the family of Avicenniaceae[8,9]. Phytochemical screening of Avicenna marina aqueous leaf extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, carbohydrates, glycosides, tannins, triterpenoids, and steroids [10,11]. It has been found to possess major therapeutic activity such as antibacterial, anti-helminthic [12], antimicrobial [13], antiviral [14], antihuman immunodeficiency virus, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activity [15]. Mangrove extracts can be a possible source of mosquito larvicides. Mangrove plants are also reported for their antioxidant, anti-dyslipidemia, antidiarrheal, anti-filarial, anti-ulcer effect, cardiotonic properties, and antidiabetic effects [16]. Mangrove leaf extracts are nontoxic to humans and are environmentally friendly as they are less pollutant [17]. This study focused on the antiulcer activity of Avicenna marina aqueous leaf extract against indomethacin induced gastric ulceration. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that reported the antiulcer effect of AM leaves extract.Healthy male Albino Wister rats of about 175 ± 5 g were used throughout the study. The animals were acclimated to laboratory conditions of 20–22 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle for two weeks before experimentation. All rats were fed with a standard pellet diet and water ad libitum. Care and use of animals were conducted under supervision of the animal Care Committee of Mansoura University, Egypt.Avicenna marina leaves were collected from (Makadi village, Hurghada region, Egypt) in August 2014. After drying the leaves, they were pulverized into fine powder using sterilized mortar and pestle. 200 g of crushed material was taken into 500 ml of ethanol, kept on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm for 24 h. After shaking, it was filtered through layers of muslin cloth, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 min (Sigma, Laborzentifugen 2K15). Resultant extracts were evaporated and concentrated to dryness using the rotary evaporator at 45 °C. The powder was dissolved in sterilized water and stored at 4 °C [18].
