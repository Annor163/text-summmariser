@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Adipose tissue regulates insulin sensitivity via the circulating adipocytokines, leptin, resistin and adiponectin. Hypoadiponectinemia contributes to the development of obesity and related disorders such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of Brazilian propolis on adiponectin levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the mechanism of signaling pathway was explored as well. T2DM was induced in male Wistar rats using high fat diet and low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 35 mg/kg, i.p.). Propolis was administered by oral tubes. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) levels in sub abdominal adipose tissue, serum levels of adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and insulin were detected by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in sub abdominal adipose tissue, fasting plasma glucose, plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol levels were measured by colorimetric method. Results showed that Brazilian propolis ameliorated hypoadiponectinemia in T2DM rats and relieved high glucose-induced adiponectin decrease. The signaling pathway analysis indicated that PPARγ regulation was involved. In conclusion, Brazilian propolis could have beneficial effect in T2DM by increasing tissue PPARγ levels, restoring serum adiponectin levels, enhancing insulin sensitivity and subsequently, attenuating elevated glucose level.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
It is undeniable to say that there are more than 194 million people with diabetes worldwide [1,2]. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by high blood glucose levels and is associated with devastating and life-threatening complications that affect various body organs, such as blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves [3,4]. Among different types of diabetes mellitus, Type 2 account for 90% of diagnosed patients. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by both fat accumulation and impairment in insulin action, insulin production, or both; a condition called insulin resistance. Insulin resistance leads to the development of hyperglycemia. Such harmful hyperglycemia produced tissue damaging glucotoxicity, which is the major cause of diabetic complications [5]. In addition, abnormal metabolism of accumulated fat in adipose tissues can cause lipotoxicity, which can further exacerbate diabetic complications [6].The management of T2DM entails lifestyle modification and/or pharmaceutical treatment such as insulin, biguanides, sulfonylureas, and alpha glucosidase inhibitors. However, these anti-diabetic medications are far from being satisfactory because of limited efficacy and many undesirable side effects [7]. As a consequence, T2DM is still an incurable disease with poor quality of life, high morbidity and mortality. Thereby, the social and economic burdens of this disease pose an urgent need for development of novel therapeutic strategies for treatment with satisfactory efficacy and no adverse effects [8].Adipose tissue secretes many proteins and hormones such as adipocytokines, resistin, leptin, and adiponectin to control insulin sensitivity [9]. Adiponectin is a protein hormone secreted into the blood stream in average 0.01% of total plasma proteins. The important role of adiponectin comes from modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin sensitive tissue [10,11]. Accumulating evidence showed that hypoadiponectinemia played a key role in the pathogenesis of obesity and related diseases [12,13]. Furthermore, adiponectin administration to obese or diabetic mice can reduce body weight and blood glucose levels while enhancing insulin sensitivity [14,15]. Based on these data, adiponectin was conceived to be a novel therapy target for obesity and insulin resistance [16].Various factors are involved in regulation of adiponectin expression. These factors include, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-γ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α, Kruppel-like factor 7 (KLF7), and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Among these factors, PPARγ is recognized as the master regulator of gene transcription and plasma concentrations of adiponectin [9]. PPARγ binds directly to a functional PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) in adiponectin promoter, leading to enhancement of adiponectin gene transcription [17]. Indeed, adiponectin was believed to be a marker for activity of PPARγ [18].Propolis (Brazilian) is a sticky resinous mixture that honey bees collect from tree buds, sap flows, or other botanical sources. Its color varies depending on its botanical source, the most common being dark brown [19]. The chemical compositions of propolis are mainly flavonoids, aromatic acids and esters, aldehydes and ketones, fatty acids and esters, terpenes, steroids, amino acids, polysaccharides, hydrocarbon, alcohol, hydroxybenzene and other compounds [20]. Brazilian propolis composed mainly of phenolic compounds artepillin C. Besides, it was reported to contain 3-prenyl-4-hydroxycinnamic, p-coumaric, caffeic acid, and caffeoylquinic acids, cinnamic acids and the flavonoids pinobanksin and kaempferol [21]. Brazilian propolis has been reported to possess various biological activities including antioxidant, anti-microbial, liver protective, immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects [22]. In addition, it was reported to have hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects. Further, propolis was also demonstrated to control metabolic disorders in diabetic rats and to accelerate the tissue regeneration and repair of damaged pancreatic cell [23].A recent study demonstrated that Brazilian propolis restored obesity-induced down regulation of adiponectin expression. In view of this recent claim, we investigated the effect of Brazilian propolis on adiponectin levels in T2DM induced experimentally in rats [24]. The signaling pathway mechanism was explored along with the regulatory roles of PPARγ.Experimental design and animal handling were according to the guidelines of the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, for Animal Use.Male Sprague Dawley rats (160–180 mg) were housed in a certified animal care at a constant temperature (22 °C) under a 12-hour light–dark cycle, and were provided with standard rat food and water.
