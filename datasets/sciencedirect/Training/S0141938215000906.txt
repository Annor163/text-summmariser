@&#ABSTRACT@&#
GdVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ with tetragonal phase has been successfully synthesized by employing efficient irradiations. The assembly of composites with fine grains based on acoustic energy and microwave radiation requires low temperature (90°C) and short reaction time (60min). All the compounds exhibited red emissions and they can be sensitized through the doped Bi3+ ions. The dependence of pH changes and doping concentration on the fluorescence features has been discussed. The photoluminescence measurements show that the optical properties achieved the best results at pH=9 for GdVO4:Eu3+(5mol%), Bi3+(1mol%) or pH=7 for GdVO4:Eu3+.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Over the past few years, the lanthanide containing phosphors have attracted much attention on account of their unique luminescent properties which were derived from unique intra-4f transitions [1]. It has been found Ln3+ ions have very special characteristics of sharp optical emissions. They cover a wide spectrographic range and have long-lived lifetimes, which facilitate several applications including displays, phosphors, laser crystal and so on [2]. Among them, lanthanide doped vanadate has been extensively studied owing to the excellent luminescence efficiency, stable physical and chemical properties and the abundant luminous colors [3–5]. Especially gadolinium vanadate has been paid much attention based on better laser performance, higher thermal conductivity, a larger emission or adsorption cross-sections [6,7]. It is also known that the half-filled shell ground state of the gadolinium leads to the phosphors with lowest excited levels and relatively high energy [6,7]. The encapsulated Eu3+ ions with the parity forbidden characteristics usually exhibits strong red line emissions [7,8], The resultant composite has high color purity and can be used for the fabrication of red phosphors [9,10].Recently, numerous methods have been used to achieve these materials, such as solid state reaction, thermal evaporation, hydrothermal, sol–gel and low-temperature synthesis. The supersonic microwave co-assistance (SMC) method appears as a new preparation technology for solid state material, which is considered to be promising in industrial application due to simple synthetic process, less energy loss, and fast efficiency. In our work, the Eu3+, Bi3+ co-doped GdVO4 phosphors were synthesized using the supersonic microwave co-assistance (SMC) method. The dependence of pH variation and doped Bi3+ on the photoluminescence properties has been explored.Gd2O3, Eu2O3 and Bi2O3 powders were dissolved in nitric acid, to prepare Gd(NO3)3, Bi(NO3)3, Eu(NO3)3 powders. NH4VO3 was used as a starting material. GdVO4:Bi3+, Eu3+ were synthesized by the supersonic microwave co-assistance (SMC) method. For the synthesis of GdVO4:Bi3+, Eu3+. Microwave power was set as 200W and reaction temperature was remained to be 90°C, Supersonic power was 200W with the reverse duty cycle 2s. All the operation time was fixed as 60min. The derived samples were cooled down to room temperature in air. Centrifugation was used to collect the precipitates. After washing twice with distilled water and absolute alcohol, the as-derived sample was dried at 70°C.Other samples GdVO4:Eu3+(0.05) and GdVO4:Bi3+(0.05), Eu3+(0.05) phosphors were prepared at pH=3, 7, 9 because the acidification of an aqueous system plays an important role in the formation of complex phosphors. Then the concentration of Bi3+ was controlled at 1–9mol% to explore the influence of Bi3+ concentration for forming phosphors, and pH was controlled at 9.The formation of gadolinium vanadate powder was confirmed by XRD patterns and the measurement was investigated on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.1541nm) in the range of 2θ=10–80°. The morphological information and characteristics of the samples were studied by a JSM-6360LV scanning electron microscope (SEM). Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Hitachi-2500 FL Spectrophotometer. Absolute quantum yields were detected at room temperature through an integrating sphere within an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrometer.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have successfully synthesized GdVO4:Eu3+, Bi3+ red phosphors via a supersonic microwave co-assistance (SMC) method at 90°C within 60min. The synthetic conditions including the pH values and the concentration of Bi3+ were investigated in detail. The results demonstrated that the phosphor gains the optimal photoluminescence at a condition of pH=9 and 1% Bi3+ co-doping. We considered that this mild and convenient SMC method would provide an alternative and efficient pathway for the preparation of novel vanadates.
