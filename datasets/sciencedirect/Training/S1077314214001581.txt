@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We present an approach for determining the temporal consistency of Particle Filters in video tracking based on model validation of their uncertainty over sliding windows. The filter uncertainty is related to the consistency of the dispersion of the filter hypotheses in the state space. We learn an uncertainty model via a mixture of Gamma distributions whose optimum number is selected by modified information-based criteria. The time-accumulated model is estimated as the sequential convolution of the uncertainty model. Model validation is performed by verifying whether the output of the filter belongs to the convolution model through its approximated cumulative density function. Experimental results and comparisons show that the proposed approach improves both precision and recall of competitive approaches such as Gaussian-based online model extraction, bank of Kalman filters and empirical thresholding. We combine the proposed approach with a state-of-the-art online performance estimator for video tracking and show that it improves accuracy compared to the same estimator with manually tuned thresholds while reducing the overall computational cost.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Sequential Monte Carlo methods, also known as Particle Filters, have demonstrated their success for parameter estimation in nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems in many areas such as video tracking [1], navigation [2], econometrics [3] and signal processing [4]. When the observed data hold the modeling assumptions, the estimated errors converge to zero [5] (i.e. with zero mean and small covariance). However, several sources of error exist that affect the filter performance and lead to inconsistency, where the estimated errors have non-zero mean or high covariance [6]. Filter consistency is commonly analyzed to detect estimation errors over time [7].Determining the temporal consistency of Particle Filters can be cast as a change detection problem [8]: consistency measures are generated and then analyzed for deciding between one of two cases, namely consistent or inconsistent operation. Examples of such approaches include the χ2 validation [6], the cumulative sum (CUSUM) [9] and the expected model likelihood [10]. However, their performance is limited due to drawbacks related to high-dimensional state spaces [6], prior change magnitude assumptions [9] or empirical thresholding [10]. Domain-related knowledge can be exploited to improve change detection performance. For example, in video tracking, Particle Filter consistency is measured as spatial uncertainty [11], time-reversibility [12] or combining both approaches [13]. However, current approaches are tuned to particular data either in the consistency measurement or in the change detection process due to the need of using empirical thresholding approach [12,13].In order to enable the application of Particle Filter validation to unseen data, in this paper we propose an approach to estimate its temporal consistency without relying on empirical thresholding and we present a robust model for temporal filter uncertainty. We measure filter consistency as its uncertainty (dispersion of its hypotheses in the state space) and validate an uncertainty model over sliding windows, allowing to increase the robustness of the consistency estimation, unlike existing approaches based on single-point analysis [14,12,13]. Such uncertainty model is approximated by sequential convolutions of mixtures of Gamma distributions whose number of mixture components is selected via modified information-based criteria. By applying hypothesis testing over filter uncertainty models, the parameters required for detecting inconsistency are automatically determined, unlike empirical-based approaches [15,12,13,16]. The proposed approach is included in a framework for online performance evaluation of video tracking [13]. The results show that the proposed approach improves related work over two heterogeneous datasets containing challenges in both change detection and video tracking.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 states the addressed problem and Section 3 discusses the related work. Section 4 presents the proposed approach whereas Section 5 describes the filter consistency modeling. Section 6 introduces its use for video tracking evaluation. Section 7 presents and discusses the experimental results. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.LetXt={(xt(n),πt(n))}n=1,…,Nbe the output of N weighted particles generated by a Particle Filter at time t, where eachxt(n)defines a hypothetical estimation weighted byπt(n). Each particle should have a low (high) weight when it is far from (close to) the ideal state. Each particle is recursively obtained with a prediction,g(.)[17]:(1)xt(n)=gxt-1(n),κt,and an update stepz(.):(2)πt(n)∝zxt(n),ρt,whereκtt=1,…andρtt=1,…are independent and identically distributed random processes. From these steps two distributions are derived, namely the prior and posterior distribution. The prior distribution predicts the states (particles) relying on previous data only; whereas the posterior distribution is estimated by considering the prior given all observations up to the current observation time.The problem we address is the online determination of the consistency of the filter (i.e. its reliability) by observing the posterior distribution. A consistent behavior means thatXtprovides an accurate state estimation. Let C and I be the labels for consistency and inconsistency, respectively. The goal of online inconsistency detection is to assign a labelltas follows:(3)Xt→φ(·)lt∈{C,I},whereφ(·)is the labeling approach. Such approach should be accurate, offer low latency and operate without manual parameter tuning. Fig. 1shows an example of a Particle-Filter-based tracker where the filter becomes inconsistent as most of the hypotheses are apart from each other and have small weights. The labeling approach shall automatically identify this inconsistent behavior of the filter.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We presented an online estimation of Particle Filter consistency that uses a sliding-window-based hypothesis testing approach and models filter uncertainty as convolutions of mixtures of Gamma distributions. Compared to manual thresholding, the proposed approach increased the precision and maintained the recall values. We applied the proposed approach to online evaluation of video tracking, without the need of ground truth data. Experiments show that the proposed approach generalizes better than the corresponding threshold-based solution. Results also indicate that filter inconsistency does not last long in video tracking, which requires to use short window lengths. The high precision values of the proposed approach allow us to reduce the overall computational time as a smaller number of detections are generated. Finally, the results over recent video trackers demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed approach.Although our approach was demonstrated on Particle Filter, it can be applied to other multi-hypothesis filters that allow the measurement of the spread of its hypotheses (i.e, representing its posterior target estimation as set of samples and associated weights). As future work, we will explore its application to deterministic filters through appropriate adaptations [15,36], model validation based on multiple detectors and the selection of the optimum window length for a particular Particle Filter setting.
