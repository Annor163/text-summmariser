@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A generalized shell heat transfer element is formulated in isoparametric coordinates to simulate the 3D thermal of non-uniformly heated shells with curved geometries. The element uses a combination of finite element and control volume methods to discretize the domain of the element into 2D layers that are coupled by a finite difference calculation. As demonstrated in previous work, the finite element-control volume formulation allows the thermal response to be evaluated with minimal computational expense and the temperature field is calculated in a manner that is compatible with distributed plasticity elements for structural analysis. Although the formulation uses a mixture of finite element and finite difference equations, the element equations are in a form that can readily be implemented in a commercial finite element code. The nine-node quadratic element considered here is implemented in Abaqus as a user-defined element. One-, two-, and three-dimensional verification cases are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the element. Comparisons between the shell heat transfer element and traditional continuum heat transfer elements illustrate that the shell element converges rapidly and results in significant savings in computational expense.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Macro finite elements (e.g., frame elements, shell elements, and component models) are widely used in computational mechanics to efficiently simulate structural response under various types of loading conditions. Macro elements utilize simplifying assumptions about the underlying physics to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the model. For example, the Euler–Bernoulli hypothesis that plane sections remain plane during bending allows the behavior of a beam to be modeled by a line element with translational and rotational degrees of freedom at the element׳s ends. Due to the considerable reduction in degrees of freedom (i.e., in comparison to continuum models), macro elements allow the response of complex, large-scale structural systems to be studied in ways that would not be possible with continuum models due to excessive computational expense.Despite the widespread use of macro elements in structural mechanics, limited research has sought to formulate macro finite elements for other field problems. Semi-analytical methods have been applied to efficiently calculate heat transfer in solids but these techniques lack generality. Surana and others [1–5] proposed a hierarchical p-version formulation to simulate the heat transfer in laminated shells. In the p-version formulation, the temperature field is interpolated from nodal values in the three coordinate directions. Continuity conditions are imposed at the interlaminar boundaries, allowing the temperature through the thickness of the shell to be approximated by a piecewise function. The lowest degree of polynomial that can be represented in the p-version formulation is linear, which requires a minimum of two nodes for each layer.Jeffers [6] proposed an alternative formulation for a layered plate heat transfer element that was based on a combination of finite element and control volume approaches. As shown inFig. 1, the layer temperature varied in plane according to the 2D shape functions, while the layers were treated as lumped masses in the transverse direction. To satisfy the principle of energy conservation, heat transfer in the transverse direction was simulated via a finite difference calculation. Verification exercises demonstrated that the element exhibited excellent accuracy with minimal computational expense, making the element an attractive alternative to 3D continuum elements.The finite element-control volume approach for heat transfer analysis [6–8] has an added benefit of providing compatibility between the heat transfer model and distributed plasticity elements that are used in structural mechanics. The compatibility arises from the fact that there is a one-to-one mapping between the temperature degrees of freedom in the heat transfer element and the integration points in the structural element (i.e., for the calculation of thermal stresses/strains and the application of temperature-dependent constitutive relationships). The seamless transfer of data from the thermal analysis to the structural analysis prevents excessive calculations that would otherwise be needed to interpolate and/or discard temperature data.In the present paper, the formulation by Jeffers [6] is extended to allow for shells of curved geometries, as illustrated inFig. 2. The finite element-control volume approach is maintained in the present formulation. However, the element geometry is expressed in natural coordinates ξ, η, and ζ rather than in Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z. Thus, a geometric transformation is introduced in the formulation to transform the element from ξηζ coordinates to xyz coordinates. The generalized formulation is presented in Section 2, and a verification study is performed in Section 3.The generalized shell heat transfer element (shown in Fig. 2) is discretized into n layers. It is assumed that the thickness of the shell is relatively small in comparison to the other dimensions (e.g., that its mechanical behavior can be described by shell bending theory). Because the thickness is small in comparison to the other dimensions, the temperature gradients produced by non-uniform heating on the surface of the shell are more pronounced over the thickness of the element than in other directions. Therefore, an optimal solution to the 3D heat transfer equations requires a large number of degrees of freedom over the thickness and fewer degrees of freedom to describe the in-plane behavior.In the present formulation, the mixed finite element-control volume method proposed in [6–8] is used. The temperatures for each layer in the ξ–η plane are interpolated from the nodal temperature using 2D shape functions, while the layer temperatures in the ζ-direction are modeled as lumped masses. Governing equations in global xyz coordinates are transformed to the natural ξηζ coordinates based on a geometric relationship between the global and natural coordinates.The degrees of freedom for the element consist of the layer temperatures at each node. For an element with n layers, the element has n temperature degrees of freedom at each node. If the element has m nodes, the element has a total ofnmtemperature degrees of freedom. Temperatures in the ξ–η plane may be interpolated as linear or quadratic. The present formulation considers a base geometry that is quadrilateral. However, the formulation can be extended to triangular elements.The element׳s geometry is defined in terms of the nodal coordinates (xj, yj, zj) at the mid-surface of the shell, the thickness tj, and the thickness-direction vectornjfor each node j. Shown inFig. 3, the thickness-direction vectornjis dependent on the direction cosines lj, mj, and njof the line that is normal to the mid-surface, i.e., [9](1)nj=tj{ljmjnj}If points 1 and 2 along the normal vector have coordinates (x1j,y1j, z1j) and (x2j,y2j, z2j), respectively, the direction cosines are calculated by(2){ljmjnj}=1tj{x1j−x2jy1j−y2jz1j−z2j}Note that the midsurface coordinates are the average of the coordinates of points 1 and 2 at the top and bottom surfaces of the plate, i.e.,(3)xj=(x1j−x2j)/2yj=(y1j−y2j)/2zj=(z1j−z2j)/2Because the element geometry is described in this manner, the shape functions Njare dependent on ξ and η only (i.e., the shape functions are independent of ζ). Thus, the coordinates of an arbitrary point on the element׳s domain are given by(4){xyz}=∑j=1mNj{xjyjzj}+∑j=1mNjζtj2{ljmjnj},where j=node number, m=total number of nodes for the element, (xj,yj, zj)=coordinates for node j, Nj=2D shape function in natural coordinates ξ and η, ζ=natural coordinate ranging from −1 to +1 describing the position through the thickness (see Fig. 3), tj=the thickness of the element at node j, and lj, mj, nj=direction cosines associated with the thickness-direction vector [9].The Jacobian matrix is used in the transformation between global xyz coordinates and natural ξηζ coordinates in the element formulation. The Jacobian matrix J for the element is(5)J=[x,ξy,ξz,ξx,ηy,ηz,ηx,ζy,ζz,ζ],where the shorthand notationx,ξis used to denote differentiation of x with respect to ξ, i.e.,x,ξ=dx/dξ. Differentiating Eq. (4) results in the following terms in the Jacobian matrix:(6)x,ξ=∑j=1mNj,ξ(xj+ζtj2lj)x,η=∑j=1mNj,η(xj+ζtj2lj)x,ζ=∑j=1mNjtj2ljy,ξ=∑j=1mNj,ξ(yj+ζtj2mj)y,η=∑j=1mNj,η(yj+ζtj2mj)y,ζ=∑j=1mNjtj2mjz,ξ=∑j=1mNj,ξ(zj+ζtj2nj)z,η=∑j=1mNj,η(zj+ζtj2nj)z,ζ=∑j=1mNjtj2njThe governing equation for heat transfer analysis in the element is derived by enforcing conservation of energy. For a differential element in 3D space, conduction heat transfer is given by(7)ρC∂T∂t=∂∂x(k∂T∂x)+∂∂y(k∂T∂y)+∂∂z(k∂T∂z)+Q,where ρ is mass density, C is specific heat, k is conductivity, T is temperature, t is time, and Q is internal heat generation per unit volume [10]. The weak form of the governing equation, which is needed for the finite element and control volume methods, is obtained by integrating Eq. (7) over the domain. Rather than integrating Eq. (7) over the entire element׳s domain, the element is discretized in layers with Videnoting the volume of layer i. Therefore, the weak form of the governing equation for layer i is(8)∫Vi[ρC∂T∂t−∂∂x(k∂T∂x)−∂∂y(k∂T∂y)−∂∂z(k∂T∂z)−Q]dVi=0Because the thickness of layer i is small, the temperature T is assumed to only vary in the ξ–η plane. Therefore, the temperature is constant in the normal direction (or the ζ direction in natural coordinates). The temperature T (x, y, z, t) in Eq. (8) is replaced by the layer temperature Ti, which is dependent only on ξ, η, and t. To satisfy the energy balance, additional terms are added to the governing equation to account for heat transfer from the adjacent layers. The xyz coordinate space is maintained for the time-being. The governing equation becomes(9)∫Vi[ρC∂Ti∂t−∂∂x(k∂Ti∂x)−∂∂y(k∂Ti∂y)−∂∂z(k∂Ti∂z)−Q]dVi+∫Ai−(k∂T∂n)|i−dAi−−∫Ai+(k∂T∂n)|i+dAi+=0The first integral in Eq. (9) results from substituting the layer temperature Tiinto Eq. (8) while the remaining terms account for the heat flux that enters the bottom and top surfaces of layer i by conduction from the adjacent layers. Symbols i− and i+ represent the boundaries between layers (i.e., at i–1/2 and i+1/2, respectively). Note that conduction heat transfer occurs normal to the element׳s mid-surface. Therefore, temperature gradients are expressed in terms of the normal direction n and the energy flow is integrated over the interface between layers. Areas Ai− and Ai+ are used to denote the surface area of the interfaces at grid points i−1/2 and i+1/2, respectively.Because the layer temperatures are lumped in the normal direction n, the heat transfer by conduction from the adjacent layers can be approximated as a finite difference, i.e.,(10)(k∂T∂n)|i−=ki−(Ti−Ti−1di−di−1),(k∂T∂n)|i+=ki+(Ti+1−Tidi+1−di)whereki−andki+are effective thermal conductivities at the layer interfaces, which are calculated by averaging the thermal resistances of adjacent layers [11], and diis a coordinate in xyz space that corresponds to the normal direction represented by ζ in the dimensionless ξηζ space. Coordinate diis the location at which the layer temperature is lumped in the normal direction. For interior layers, dicoincides with the mid-surface of the layer. For exterior layers, dicoincides with the surface of the element to provide greater accuracy in modeling the thermal boundary conditions at the element׳s surface [11]. Eq. (10) is expressed in xyz space, although it will eventually be transformed into ξηζ space.Note that Eq. (10) only applies to interior layers for which heat is transferred by conduction from an adjacent layer. For exterior layers, the appropriate boundary conditions must be applied. If a temperature Tsis prescribed on the surface of the element, then(11)Ti=Tsand the flux is unknown. If a fluxqb″is prescribed at the surface of the element, then(12)(k∂T∂n)|i±=qb″If a convective boundary condition exists at the surface of the element, then(13)(k∂T∂n)|i±=h(T∞−Ti),where h is heat transfer coefficient andT∞is fluid temperature. If a radiation boundary condition exists at the surface of the element, then the radiation term can be expressed in the following linearized form [10]:(14)(k∂T∂n)|i±=hr(Tsur−Ti),where hris an effective heat transfer coefficient due to radiation and Tsuris the temperature of the surroundings. The effective heat transfer coefficient is given as(15)hr=εσ(Ti+Tsur)(Ti2+Tsur2),where ε is emissivity of the surface, and σ is Stefan–Boltzmann constant.The layer temperatures Tiare obtained from the nodal temperatures using the interpolation functions N, i.e.,(16)Ti=NTiAs described in Section 2.1, the element shape functions N are 2D shape functions that are dependent on ξ and η only. Because the governing equation (i.e., Eq. (9)) is in global xyz coordinates, the finite element method is applied in xyz coordinate space and a geometric transformation is then performed to transform the resulting equation to natural ξηζ coordinates.The Galerkin finite element method is applied to Eq. (9) by premultiplying all terms by the transpose of the shape function matrix N. The diffusion terms are expanded using integration by parts, and the resulting boundary term is converted from a volume integral to a surface integral using Gauss׳s theorem [11]. The resulting equation is(17)∫Vi(NTρC∂Ti∂t+N,xTk∂Ti∂x+N,yTk∂Ti∂y+N,zTk∂Ti∂z−NTQ)dVi−∫S(NTk∂Ti∂n)n¯dS+∫Ai−NT(k∂T∂n)|i−dAi−−∫Ai+NT(k∂T∂n)|i+dAi+=0where[N,x]=∂[N]/∂x,[N,y]=∂[N]/∂y,n¯=unit vector, which is normal to the bounding surface S. Note that the surface S is the remaining part of the layer׳s surface that lies along the edge of the element and was not explicitly accounted for in Eq. (9), as illustrated inFig. 4. The termk∂Ti/∂nis the flux that acts normal to the surface S. Thus, for a prescribed fluxq″s, convective condition, or radiation condition, the boundary flux is respectively given by(18)k∂Ti∂n=qs″,k∂Ti∂n=h(T∞−Ti),k∂Ti∂n=hr(Tsur−Ti)The finite difference approximations in Eq. (10) are substituted into Eq. (17) for typical interior layers, while the appropriate boundary conditions from Eqs. (11)–(14) are applied to the exterior layers. All three boundary conditions in Eq. (18) are substituted into Eq. (17), although it is acknowledged that all types of boundary conditions may not be present at the same time. The layer temperature Tifrom Eq. (16) is also substituted into Eq. (17). For a typical interior layer, Eq. (17) becomes(19)∫Vi(NTρCNṪi+N,xTkN,xTi+N,yTkN,yTi+N,zTkN,zTi−NTQ)dVi+∫Ai−NT(k∂T∂n)|i−dAi−−∫Ai+NT(k∂T∂n)|i+dAi+−∫SNT(qs″+hT∞+hrTsur)dS+∫SNT(h+hr)NTidS=0Because the shape functions are expressed in ξ and η, and numerical integration is more readily carried out in natural coordinates, Eq. (19) is transformed from global xyz coordinates to natural ξηζ coordinates. The transformation for most terms in Eq. (19) is straightforward and does not require discussion. However, the diffusion terms in Eq. (19), which involve derivatives of shape functions with regards to x, y, and z, requires attention.Derivatives of the shape function at node j with respect to ξ, η, and ζ are related to the derivatives of the shape function with respect to x, y, and z by the Jacobian J, i.e.,(20)∂Nj∂ξ=∂Nj∂x∂x∂ξ+∂Nj∂y∂y∂ξ+∂Nj∂z∂z∂ξ∂Nj∂η=∂Nj∂x∂x∂η+∂Nj∂ydy∂η+∂Nj∂z∂z∂η∂Nj∂ζ=∂Nj∂x∂x∂ζ+∂Nj∂y∂y∂ζ+∂Nj∂z∂z∂ζor in matrix form(21){Nj,ξNj,ηNj,ζ}=J{Nj,xNj,yNj,z}The derivatives of the shape function with respect to x, y, and z are obtained by multiplying both sides of Eq. (21) by the inverse of the Jacobian(22){Nj,xNj,yNj,z}=J−1{Nj,ξNj,ηNj,ζ}=Γ{Nj,ξNj,ηNj,ζ},where Γ=J−1. All shape functions are independent of ζ, and so Nj,ζ=0. Therefore, the derivatives of the shape function with respect to x, y, and z are given by(23)Nj,x=Γ11Nj,ξ+Γ12Nj,ηNj,y=Γ21Nj,ξ+Γ22Nj,ηNj,z=Γ31Nj,ξ+Γ32Nj,ηEq. (23) is used for calculating derivatives of the shape functions with respect to x, y, and z in Eq. (19) so that all terms in the governing equation are functions of ξ, η, and ζ.In addition, the terms at the boundaries i- and i+ are expressed in natural coordinates as(24)k∂T∂n=k∂T∂ζdζdn,where dζ/dn=2/tiand ti=layer thickness. Therefore, the following expressions are substituted into Eq. (19) in place of Eq. (10):(25)(k∂T∂n)|i−=ki−(Ti−Ti−1ζi−ζi−1)2ti,(k∂T∂n)|i+=ki+(Ti+1−Tiζi+1−ζi)2tiLastly, the limits of integration are transformed from xyz space to ξηζ space. The governing equation becomes(26)∫−11∫−11∫ζ−ζ+(NTρCNṪi+N,xTkN,xTi+N,yTkN,yTi+N,zTkN,zTi−NTQ)Jdζdξdη+∫−11∫−11(NTki−ζi−ζi−12tiN)(Ti−Ti−1)Ji−dξdη−∫−11∫−11(NTki+ζi+1−ζi2tiN)(Ti+1−Ti)Ji+dξdη−∫SNT(qs″+hT∞+hrTsur)dS+∫SNT(h+hr)NTidS=0,where ζ− and ζ+=the natural coordinates corresponding to the bottom and top surfaces of layer i, J=the determinant of the Jacobian matrix in Eq. (5), Ji−=the determinant of the Jacobian evaluated at the bottom surface of the layer (i.e., at ζ=ζ−), and Ji+=the determinant of the Jacobian evaluated at the top surface of the layer (i.e., at ζ=ζ+). For the remainder of the paper, it is assumed that the layer thickness tiis constant, for which the integral from ζ− to ζ+ simplifies to layer thickness tiand the Jacobian J is evaluated only at the depth ζ where the temperature is calculated (i.e., J is no longer a function of ζ).After some manipulation, Eq. (26) can be written in the following simplified form:(27)ciṪi+kiTi−(ki−Ti−1+ki+Ti+1)=ri,where(28)ci=∫−11∫−11NTρCtiNJdξdη(29)ki=∫−11∫−11N,xTktiN,xJdξdη+∫−11∫−11N,yTktiN,yJdξdη+∫−11∫−11N,zTktiN,zJdξdη+ki−+ki++hi(30)ki−=∫−11∫−11(NTki−ζi−ζi−12tiN)Ji−dξdη(31)ki+=∫−11∫−11(NTki−ζi+1−ζi2tiN)Ji+dξdη(32)hi=∫SNT(h+hr)NdS(33)ri=rQ+rq+rh(34)rQ=∫−11∫−11NTQtiJdξdη(35)rq=∫SNTqs″dS(36)rh=∫SNT(hT∞+hrTsur)dSIn Eqs. (27)–(36), ciis the heat capacity matrix for layer i; kiis the conductivity matrix for layer i; ki− and ki+ are the adjacent layer conductivity matrices for layer i; hiis the convection heat transfer matrix for layer i, which also includes the linearized radiation term; riis the vector of thermal loads for layer i, which includes internal heat generation rQ, prescribed flux rq, and convection and radiation boundary conditions rh.For exterior layers, Eq. (27) is modified to include the appropriate boundary conditions specified in Eqs. (12)–(14). For a prescribed flux, the following term is added to ri:(37)rqb=∫−11∫−11NTqb″JdξdηFor a convection boundary condition, the following terms are added to kiand ri, respectively:(38)hb=∫−11∫−11NThNJdξdη,rhb=∫−11∫−11NThT∞JdξdηFor a radiation boundary condition, the following terms are added to kiand ri, respectively:(39)hrb=∫−11∫−11NThrNJdξdη,rhrb=∫−11∫−11NThrTsurJdξdηThe governing equations for the element are obtained by assembling the equations for each layer i, which are given in Eqs. (27)-(39), into the element׳s system of equations, as described by Jeffers [6].The nine-node quadratic heat transfer element was implemented in Abaqus [12] as a user-defined element to verify the element formulation. The verification involved the heating of a pipe that has an inner radius riof 10cm, an outer radius roof 15cm, and a length L of 50cm, as shown inFig. 5. Note that the pipe had a relatively large thickness to simulate an extreme case of geometry that more closely resembles a continuum rather than a shell. The verification problems involved 1D axisymmetric heating (Fig. 6a), 2D axisymmetric heating (Fig. 6b), 2D symmetric heating (Fig. 6c), and 3D heating (Fig. 6d). In all cases, the pipe had an initial temperature of 0°C and was heated instantaneously by the prescribed flux given in Fig. 6. Convection boundary conditions were applied on the inner surface and portions of the outer surface of the pipe to simulate extreme cases of non-uniform heating. The edges of the pipe were treated as insulated. The pipe was assumed to be made of steel with density ρ=7850kg/m3, conductivity k=54W/m2K, and specific heat C=465J/kgK.The problem was modeled using shell elements with an increasingly fine mesh until the solution was found to converge. The mesh configuration for the shell model was defined by the number of elements in the tangential and longitudinal directions of the pipe. A model with a mesh configuration of 8×4 can be seen inFig. 7a, in which eight elements were specified around the pipe and four elements were specified along length of the pipe. The number of layers was another a mesh parameter considered in the verification study. Comparisons were made between the shell model and a high-fidelity continuum model using linear heat transfer elements in Abaqus. The mesh for the 3D case is shown in Fig. 7b. The shell and continuum models both used fixed incrementation with a time step of 10s. Results from the verification study are given as follows.The first verification case explored the accuracy of the shell model in capturing 1D heat transfer over the depth for an axisymmetric geometry, as illustrated in Fig. 6a. Four elements were prescribed in the tangential direction, two elements were prescribed along the length, and the number of layers was increased from three to nine. The temperature through the thickness of the shell is shown inFig. 8 at various times. It can be seen that even a coarse mesh of three layers yielded excellent accuracy in comparison to the converged continuum model. The L2- (i.e., vector-) norm error was calculated through the thickness to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the control volume method. The errors shown inTable 1 illustrate that the accuracy of the solution improves with increasing numbers of layers. With five or more layers, the error is less than 1.5%, demonstrating that the control volume approximation is sufficiently accurate for the curved shell. Note that the error increases slightly (i.e., by a few hundredths of a percent) as the number of layers increases, for example, from seven to nine. It could not be discerned whether the error stemmed from the shell model or the continuum model, but the error was deemed small enough to not be a concern. For the remaining analyses in Sections 3.2–3.4, seven layers were specified over the thickness of the shell.The second verification case explored the accuracy of the shell model in capturing 2D heat transfer for an axisymmetric geometry, as illustrated in Fig. 6b. The number of elements along the length was increased systematically from two to eight. The number of elements in the tangential direction was correspondingly increased from four to sixteen to maintain regular element geometries.The mid-depth temperature along the length of pipe is plotted inFig. 9 at various times. It can be seen that the temperature distribution resembled a step function that gradually smoothed out over time. Nodal temperatures are plotted in Fig. 9 for two, four, and eight shell elements along the length. Temperatures between the nodal values were calculated using the quadratic interpolation functions that were specified in the element formulation. It can be seen that the temperatures calculated by the shell model generally agreed well with the converged continuum model. The errors were greatest for the coarse meshes at the earlier times, when the shape of the temperature profile more closely resembled the step function. However, accuracy improved as time progressed and the temperature profile smoothed out. The L2-norm error was calculated over the length of the pipe at the selected times and shown inTable 2. It can be seen that the model consistently converges to the high-resolution continuum model, with errors less than 2.5% for the mesh involving four elements along the length.The third verification case explored the accuracy of the shell model in capturing 2D heat transfer across the section, as illustrated in Fig. 6c. The number of elements in the tangential direction was systematically increased from four to sixteen. The number of elements along the length was correspondingly increased from two to eight to maintain regular element geometries.The mid-depth temperature at various times is plotted inFig. 10 for a tangential path s from the bottom of the pipe to the top of the pipe, as illustrated in Fig. 6c. The temperature rose steeply along the path at earlier times. However, the temperature profile smoothed out as time progressed, as was the case in the 2D axisymmetric example. Nodal temperatures are plotted in Fig. 10 for four, eight, and sixteen shell elements in the tangential direction. Temperatures between the nodes were calculated using the quadratic interpolation functions that were specified in the element formulation. It can be seen that the temperatures calculated by the shell model generally agreed well with the converged continuum model, with errors greatest at earlier times. The L2-norm error was calculated over the tangential path at the selected times and shown inTable 3. It can be seen that the model consistently converges to the high-resolution continuum model, with errors less than 2.5% for the mesh involving eight elements in the tangential direction.The final verification case explored the accuracy of the shell model in simulating 3D heat transfer, as illustrated in Fig. 6d. Four meshes were considered in the shell model: 4×2, 8×4, and 16×8. Once the temperatures were calculated, the pipe geometry was cut through the thickness (A–A inFig. 11a) and along the length (B–B in Fig. 11a) and unfolded (Fig. 11b) so that the temperature field could be depicted as 2D contour plot. The temperature field over the mid-surface of the plate is shown inFig. 12 for the various meshes. It can be seen that the solution converged as the mesh was refined. The L2-norm error between the shell model and the continuum model was calculated for the entire mid-surface of the pipe, which can be seen inTable 4. The shell model consistently converged to the solution obtained from the continuum model, and errors were less than 3% for the relatively coarse 8×4 mesh. To illustrate the locations that had the highest error, the temperature difference between the shell model and the continuum model is shown as a contour plot inFig. 13 for the various meshes. It can be seen that the error was greatest in the model with the 4×2 mesh and stemmed from the assumption of quadratic temperature field throughout the layer. The error rapidly declined with the 8×4 mesh and was negligible for 16×8 mesh.To understand the cost savings that can be realized with the use of the shell heat transfer element, the model sizes and simulation times were compared for the shell and continuum models. As illustrated inTable 5, the shell model with the 8×4 mesh required 7.5s to run on a single 2.60GHz processor, whereas the continuum model required 197s (3.3min) of simulation time. The cost savings is due in part to the significant reduction in degrees of freedom that can be achieved with the shell model. Thus, for a fraction of the computational expense, a solution with acceptable accuracy (i.e., within 3%) can be achieved using a relatively coarse mesh of shell heat transfer elements.A combination of control volume and finite element methods was used to formulate a novel shell heat transfer element that can efficiently model the 3D thermal response of non-uniformly heated structures. The element was formulated in isoparametric coordinates to allow the element to have arbitrary geometry in three-dimensional space. A series of 1D, 2D, and 3D verification problems was considered to examine the convergence to a solution obtained using traditional continuum finite elements. The shell element exhibited excellent accuracy with a small number of layers and elements, which led to a significant reduction in number of temperature degrees of freedom in the model and considerable savings in computational expense. The savings in computational cost will be amplified as the element is used to model larger and more complex types of structures.
