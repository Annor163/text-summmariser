@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, some multi-item inventory models for deteriorating items are developed in a random planning horizon under inflation and time value money with space and budget constraints. The proposed models allow stock dependent consumption rate and partially backlogged shortages. Here the time horizon is a random variable with exponential distribution. The inventory parameters other than planning horizon are deterministic in one model and in the other, the deterioration and net value of the money are fuzzy, available budget and space are fuzzy and random fuzzy respectively. Fuzzy and random fuzzy constraints have been defuzzified using possibility and possibility–probability chance constraint techniques. The fuzzy objective function also has been defuzzified using possibility chance constraint against a goal. Both deterministic optimization problems are formulated for maximization of profit and solved using genetic algorithm (GA) and fuzzy simulation based genetic algorithm (FAGA). The models are illustrated with some numerical data. Results for different achievement levels are obtained and sensitivity analysis on expected profit function is also presented.Scope and purposeThe traditional inventory model considers the ideal case in which depletion of inventory is caused by a constant demand rate. However for more sale, inventory should be maintained at a higher level. Of course, this would result in higher holding or procurement cost, etc. Also, in many real situations, during a shortage period, the longer the waiting time is, the smaller the backlogging rate would be. For instance, for fashionable commodities and high-tech products with short product life cycle, the willingness for a customer to wait for backlogging diminishes with the length of the waiting time. Most of the classical inventory models did not take into account the effects of inflation and time value of money. But at present, the economic situation of most of the countries has been much deteriorated due to large scale inflation and consequent sharp decline in the purchasing power of money. So, it has not been possible to ignore the effects of inflation and time value of money any further. The purpose of this article is to maximize the expected profit of two inventory control systems in the random planning horizon.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the past few decades, many researchers have studied inventory models with constant demand or dynamic demand (cf. Maity and Maiti [1]), Taleizadeh et al. [2–5], Maity [6], and others). More over, in a competitive market, attractive display of units in the showroom is an important factor. Levin et al. [7] noted that at times, the presence of inventory has a motivational effect on the people around it. It is a common belief that large piles of goods displayed in a super market will lead the customers to buy more”. Thus many business people use the attractive display of units in the showroom to influence the customers. Maiti and Maiti [8] Roy et al. [9,27], Maity [10] and others have developed inventory models with stock dependent demand.In most of the earlier inventory models, life time of an item is assumed to be infinite while it is in storage. But, in reality, many physical goods deteriorate due to dryness, spoilage, vaporization, etc., and are damaged due to hoarding longer than their normal storage period. The deterioration also depends on preserving facilities and environmental conditions in warehouses/storage. So, due to deterioration effect, a certain fraction of the items either damaged or decayed and are not in perfect condition to satisfy the future demand of customers for good items. Deterioration for such items is continuous and constant or time-dependent and/or dependent on the on-hand inventory. A number of research papers have already been published on the above type of items by Maiti et al. [1], Roy et al. [11] and others.Moreover, the effects of inflation and time value of money are vital in practical situation, especially in the developing countries with large scale inflation. Therefore, the effect of inflation and time value of money can not be ignored in real situations. To relax the assumption of no inflationary effects on costs, Buzacott [13] and Misra [15] simultaneously developed an EOQ model with a constant inflation rate for all associated costs. Bierman and Thomas [16] then proposed an EOQ model under inflation that also incorporated the discount rate. Misra [17] then extended the EOQ model with different inflation rates for various associated costs. Recently, Chern et al. [18] proposed partial backlogging inventory lot-size models for deteriorating items with fluctuating demand under inflation. Maity and Maiti [14] developed a multi-objective optimal inventory control problem for deteriorating multi-items under fuzzy inflation and discounting. Yang et al. [34] proposed an inventory model under inflation for deteriorating items with stock-dependent consumption rate and partial backlogging shortages.Normally production inventory models are developed in infinite planning horizon because it is assumed that the production-inventory process including the various inventory parameters, demand, etc. remain unchanged over the future infinite time. In reality, it is not so due to several reasons such as variation in inventory costs, changes in product specifications and designs, technological changes due to environmental conditions, availably of product, etc. Moreover, for seasonal products like fruits, vegetables, warm garments, etc. business period is finite. Das et al. [20] and others supported this idea. Rather, for seasonal products, the planning horizon is not fixed, it varies over the years and may be considered as a random variable with some probability distribution. Recently, Taleizadeh et al. [28–32] developed and solved some inventory models in fuzzy, random, fuzzy-random, and fuzzy-rough environments using soft computing and others techniques. Table 1represents the summary of related literature for multi-item partial backlogging inventory models.Use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) in complex decision making problems is well established (Michalewicz [25], Jana et al. [36]. A simple GA starts with a set of potential solutions (called initial population) of the decision making problem under consideration. Individual solutions are called chromosome. Crossover and mutation operations are performed among the potential solutions with some probability pcand pm, respectively, to get a new set of solutions and it continues until terminating conditions are encountered. Behavior and performance of a GA is directly affected by the interaction between the parameters, i.e., selection process of chromosomes for mating pool, pc, pm, etc. Poor parameter settings usually leads to several problems such as premature convergence. Extensive research work has been made to improve the performance of GA for single/multi-objective continuous/ discrete optimization problems during last two decades. Michalewicz [25] proposed a genetic algorithm named Contractive Mapping Genetic Algorithm (CMGA) where movement from old population to new population takes place only when average fitness of new population is better than the old one and proved the asymptotic convergence of the algorithm by Banach fixed point theorem. Bessaou and Siarry [12] proposed a GA where initially more than one population of solutions are generated. Genetic operations are done on every population a finite number of times to find a promising zone of optimum solution. Finally a population of solutions is generated in this zone and genetic operations are done on this population a finite number of times to get a final solution. Last and Eyal [23] developed a GA with varying population size, where chromosomes are classified into young, middle-age and old according to their age and lifetime. Genotype diversity, Phenotype diversity of the final population are obtained to measure the performance of the GA. Pezzellaa et al. [26] developed a GA for the Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem, which integrates different strategies for generating the initial population, selecting the individuals for reproduction and reproducing new individuals. Recently many papers have been developed in GA (cf. Narmatha and Devaraj [22], Jana et al. [35]).In spite of the above mentioned developments, following lacunas still exist in the formulation and solution of inventory models of seasonal products.•In the literature, there are very few inventory models [20,28–32] under random planning horizon. Till now, none has formulated multi-item inventory models allowing shortages under random planning horizon. This vacuum has been removed by this investigation.In a real-life inventory system, limitations on available budget and storing space are very often faced by the retailers. These resources are sometimes fuzzy or random fuzzy. None has considered an inventory model with fuzzy and random fuzzy constraints.Till now, none has developed inventory models with random planning horizon taking, imprecise effect due to inflation and discounting, stock-dependent demand with uncertain resource constraint into account. Present investigation considers the above mentioned factors.Here random-fuzzy constraint has been successively introduced for the first time in a inventory model and transformed to a corresponding deterministic one using possibility-probability chance constraint techniques.In this research paper two EOQ models of an multi-items are developed in a random planning horizon, i.e., business periods are assumed as random in nature and it follows an exponential distribution with known mean. Unit production cost decreases in each production cycle due to learning effects of the workers on production. Similarly setup cost in each cycle is partly constant and partly decreases in each cycle due to learning effects of the employees. Here the models are built up with deteriorating items, stock dependent consumption rate and partially backlogged shortages under inflation and time value money with space and budget constraints. Available budget and total space are considered as fuzzy and random fuzzy respectively. Fuzzy and random fuzzy constraints have been defuzzyfied using possibility and possibility-probability chance constraints techniques. Model is formulated to maximize the expected profit from the whole planning horizon. Following Last and Eyal [23], a GA with varying population size is implemented where chromosomes are classified into young, middle-age and old according to their age and lifetime. In this GA crossover probability is a function of parent's age-type (young, middle-aged, old, etc.) and is obtained using a fuzzy rule base and fuzzy possibility theory [21]. It is an improved GA where a subset of better children is included with the parent population for next generation and size of this subset is a percentage of the size of its parent set. This GA is used to make optimal decision for above inventory model. Performance of the proposed GA for solving the model is compared with basic GA. The model is illustrated with some numerical data. Sensitivity analysis on expected profit function is also presented.Definition 1Possibility space [33]. Let Θ be a nonempty set, and P(Θ) be the power set of Θ. For each A∈P(Θ), there is a nonnegative number Pos{A}, called its possibility, such that Pos{Φ}=0, Pos{Θ}=1; andPos{∪kAk}=supkPos{Ak}for any arbitrary collection Akin P(Θ).The triplet (Θ, P(Θ), Pos) is called a possibility space, and the function Pos is referred to as a possibility measure. Then, a random fuzzy variable is firstly defined by Liu [33] as a function from a possibility space to a collection of random variables.Definition 2Random fuzzy variable [33]. A random fuzzy variable is defined as a function from the possibility space (Θ, P(Θ), Pos) to the set of random variables. An example of random fuzzy variables are given by Liu [33] as follows:Example 1Liu [33]. Assume that η1, η2, …, ηmare random variables and u1, u2, …, umare real numbers in [0, 1] such that u1⋁u2⋁…⋁um=1. Thenξ¯˜is a random fuzzy variable expressed as(1)ξ¯˜=η¯1with possibilityu1,η¯2with possibilityu2,⋯η¯mwith possibilityum.It should be noted here thatξ¯˜(i)=η¯i,i=1,…,mare regarded as functions from a possibility space (Θ, P(Θ), Pos) to a collection of random variables Γ if we define Θ={1, 2, …, m}, Pos{i}=ui, i=1, 2, …, m andΓ={η¯1,η¯2,…,η¯m}.Definition 3Membership function of a random fuzzy variable [23]. Letξ¯˜be a random fuzzy variable on the possibility space (Θ, P(Θ), Pos). Then its membership function is derived from the possibility measure Pos by(2)μ(η¯)=Pos{ϑ∈Θ|ξ¯˜(ϑ)=η¯},η¯∈ΓDefinition 4Random fuzzy variable [38]. Let Γ be a collection of random variables. Then, a random fuzzy variableC¯˜is defined by its membership function.(3)μC¯˜:Γ→[0,1]Example 2Assume thatη¯1,η¯2,…,η¯mare random variables and u1, u2, …, umare real numbers in [0, 1] such that max{u1, u2, …, um}=1. Thenη¯˜is a random fuzzy variable and its membership function is expressed as(4)ξ¯˜(Γ¯)=u1ifγ¯=η¯1,u2ifγ¯=η¯2,…umifγ¯=η¯m.Theorem 1Katagiri et al.[38], Pramanik et al.[37]:PosProb{A¯˜x≤B¯˜}≥Θˆicst≥hˆicst,i=1,…,rare equivalently transformed into the conditions∑j=1nmijc−L*(hˆiobj)αijaxj+Φ−1(Θˆicst)xtVlcx+(σia)2≤mib+L*(hˆicst)βijbThe following assumptions and notations are used for ith (i=1, 2, …, M) item.The mathematical model of the inventory replenishment problem is based on the following assumptions:(i)Demand rate is assumed to be dependent on the existing stocklevel.The time horizon (a random variable) is random.The time horizon completely accommodates first Nicycles and end during (Ni+1)th cycle.Lead time is negligible.Replenishment rate is infinite but replenishment size is finite.Shortages are allowed. Unsatisfied demand is partially backlogged. The fraction of shortages back-ordered is a differentiable and decreasing function of time t, denoted by δi(t), where t is the waiting time up to the next replenishment, and 0≤δi(t)≤1 with δi(0)=1. Note that if δi(t)=1(or 0)for all t, then shortages are completely backlogged(or lost).For deteriorating items, a constant fraction of the on- hand inventory deteriorates per unit of time and there is no repair or replacement of the deteriorated inventory during the planning period.For convenience, the following notations are used throughout the entire paper.For ith item,(i)qi(t)= On hand inventory in a cycle at time t,(j−1)Ti≤t≤jTi(j=1, …, Ni).D(qi)= The demand rate, whereD(qi)=αi+βiqi,αi,βi≥0,q(t)≥0αi,αi≥0,qi(t)≤0Ni= number of fully accommodated cycles to be made during the prescribed time horizon.Ti= duration of a complete cycle.Qij=total ordered quantity in jth cycle.pi=selling price per unitC3ij=C3i+C3i′e−γijis setup cost in jth (j=1, 2, …, N) cycle,γi>0;C3i>0;C3i′>0.

Here, it is assumed that the planning horizon H is a random variable and follows exponential distribution with probability density function (p.d.f) asf(h)=λe−λh,h≥00,otherwiseHere λ(>0) is the parameter of the distribution.M= Total number of items.BC= Available total budget cost.S==Available total space.si==Space for unit ith item.Note: The notation   denotes fuzzy variable and¯˜denotes random fuzzy variable.In the development of the models, we assume that there are Nifull cycles during the random time horizon H. The jth replenishment is made at time (j−1)Ti. The quantity received at (j−1)Tiis used partly to meet the accumulated backorders in the previous cycle. The inventory at (j−1)Tigradually reduces to zero at(j−1)Ti+Ti′(cf. Fig. 1). For the last cycle some amount may be left after the end of planning horizon. This amount is sold at a reduced price in a lot.The differential equation describing the inventory level qi(t) in the interval(j−1)Ti≤t≤(j−1)Ti+Ti′(1≤j≤Ni)is given by(5)dqi(t)dt=−(αi+βiqi(t))−Θiqi(t),(j−1)Ti≤t≤(j−1)Ti+Ti′,where αi, βi, Θi>0 and0<T′i<Ti., Subject to the end conditions that, qi(t)=0 att=(j−1)Ti+T′i.The solution of the differential Eq. (5) is given by,(6)qi(t)=αiβi+Θi(e(βi+Θi)((j−1)Ti+T′i−t)−1),(j−1)Ti≤t≤(j−1)Ti+T′iDuring the time interval[(j−1)Ti+T′i,jTi], the demand rate Di(qi)=αiand backlogged rate σi(jTi−t)=e−σi(jTi−t). Hence the amount of backorder Bi(t) is governed by the following differential equation:(7)dBi(t)dt=αie−σi(jTi−t),(j−1)Ti+T′i≤t≤jTisubject to the conditions that, Bi(t)=0 att=(j−1)Ti+T′iThe solution of the differential Eq.

So we take Θ, R as fuzzy number, i.e. asΘ˜andR˜. Then, due to this assumption, our objective function E(TP) becomes E(TP˜). Since optimization of a fuzzy objective is not well defined, so instead of E(TP˜) one can optimize its equivalent optimistic or pessimistic return of the objective function. Also considers¯˜i,S¯˜as random fuzzy in nature. When decision maker likes to optimize the optimistic equivalent of E(TP˜), then the problem reduces to the determination of T,Ti′so as to(37)MaximizeZsubject toPos{E(TP˜)≥Z}≥μ1PosProb∑i=1Ms¯˜iQi≤S¯˜≥η1≥μ2Pos∑i=1Mpi(Qi+Bi)≤BC˜≥μ3Following Liu and Iwamura [24] and Theorem-1, expression in (37) can be defuzzified and re-written as:(38)MaximizeZsubjecttoZ−E(TP1)E(TP2)−E(TP1)≥μ1∑i=1Mmis¯˜i−L*(μ2)αijs¯˜iQi+Φ−1(η2)∑i=1M(σis¯˜i)2Qi2≤miS¯˜+L*(μ2)βiS¯˜∑i=1Mpi(Qi+Bi)−BC1BC2−BC1≤1−μ3[c.f. Das et al. [19], Katagiri et al.

Let this value be Z0 and set Z=Z0 (For simplicity one can take Z0=0). Then p0 is randomly generated in α1−cut set ofR˜and let Z0= value of E{TP˜)} for R=R0 and if Z<Z0 replace Z with Z0. This step is repeated a finite number of times and final value is taken as value of Z. This phenomenon is used to develop the algorithm.1.Set Z=Z0.Generate R0 uniformly from the α1 cut set of fuzzy numberR˜.Set Z0= value of E{(TP)} for R=R0.If Z<Z0 then set Z=Z0.Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4, N times, where N is a sufficiently large positive integer.Return Z.End algorithm.Algorithm 2Algorithm to determine Z, for Model-2.Now roughly find a point R from fuzzy numberR˜, which approximately minimizes E{(TP)}. Let this value be Z0 (For simplicity one can take Z0=0 also) and ɛ be a positive number. Set Z=Z0−ɛ and ifpos{E{(TP˜)<Z}≤1−α2then increase Z with ɛ. Again checkpos{E{(TP˜)<Z}≤1−α2and it continues untilpos{E{(TP˜)<Z}>1−α2. At this stage decrease value of ɛ and again try to improve Z. When ɛ becomes sufficiently small then we stop and final value of Z is taken as value of Z. Using this criterion, required algorithm is developed as below. In the algorithm the variable F0 is used to store initial assumed value of Z and F is used to store value of Z in each iteration.1.Set Z=Z0−ɛ, F=Z0−ɛ, F0=Z0−ɛ, tol=0.0001.Generate p0 uniformly from the 1−α2 cut set of fuzzy numberp˜.Set Z0= value of E{f(x, y, p) for p=p0.If Z0<Z.then go to step 11.End IfRepeat step-2 to step-6 N times.Set F=Z.Set Z=Z+ɛ.Go to step-2.If(Z=F) // In this case optimum value of Z<Z0−ɛSet Z=F0−ɛ, F=F−ɛ, F0=F0−ɛ.Go to step-2End IfIf (ɛ<tol)go to step-21End Ifɛ=ɛ/NZ=F+ɛGo to step-2.Output F.Therefore for feasible value of the variables, we determine Z using the above algorithms and to optimize Z we use GA. Since fuzzy simulation algorithm is used to determine Z in the algorithm this GA is named as fuzzy simulation based genetic algorithm (FSGA).In natural genesis, we know that chromosomes are the main carriers of the hereditary information from parents to offsprings and that genes, which present hereditary factors, are lined up in chromosomes. At the time of reproduction, crossover and mutation take place among the chromosomes of parents. In this way, hereditary factors of parents are mixed up and carried over to their offsprings. Darwinian principle states that only the fittest animals can survive in nature. So a pair of fittest parents normally reproduces better offspring.The above mentioned phenomenon is followed to create a genetic algorithm for an optimization problem. Here potential solution of the problem is analogous with the chromosomes and chromosome of better offspring with the better solution of the problem. Crossover and mutation occur among a set of potential solutions and obtained a new set of solutions and it continues until terminating conditions are encountered. Michalewicz [25] proposed a genetic algorithm named the Contractive Mapping Genetic Algorithm (CMGA) and proved the asymptotic convergence of the algorithm by the Banach fixed-point theorem. In CMGA, movement from an old population to a new population takes place only when the average fitness of a new population is better than the old one. This algorithm is modified with the help of a fuzzy simulation process to solve the model in some cases. The algorithm is named FSGA and this presented below. In the algorithm, pc, pmare probabilities of the crossover and the probability of mutation, respectively, T is the iteration counter, and P(T) is the population of potential solutions for iteration T. The initialize (P(T)) function initializes the population P(T) at the time of initialization. The evaluate (P(T)) function evaluates the fitness of each member of P(T) and at this stage an objective function value due to each solution is evaluated via the fuzzy simulation process (using Algorithm 1).1.  T ⟵ 0.2.  Initialize pc, pm.3.  Initialize (P(T)) and let N be its size.4.  Evaluate (P(T)).5.  While (Not termination condition)6.     Select N solutions from P(T) for mating pool using roulette-wheel selectionprocess (one solution may be selected more than once). Let this set be P1(T).7.    Select solutions from P1(T) for crossover depending on pc.8.    Perform crossover on selected solutions to obtain population P1(T).9.    Select solutions from P1(T) for mutation depending on pm.10.    Perform mutation on selected solutions to obtain new population P(T+1).11.    Evaluate (P(T+1)).12.    If average fitness of P(T+1)> average fitness of P(T) then13.       T ⟵ T+1.14.     End If.15.  End While.16.  Output:Best solution of P(T).17.  End algorithm.(a) Representation: A ′n dimensional real vector’ X=(x1, x2, …, xn) is used to represent a solution, where x1, x2, …, xnrepresent n decision variables of the problem.(b) Initialization:N such solutions X1, X2, X3, …, XNare randomly generated by random number generator such that each Xisatisfies the constraints of the problem. Constraints of the problem are satisfied using Algorithm 1. This solution set is taken as initial population P(1). Also set pc=0.3, pm=0.2, T=1.(c) Fitness value: Value of the objective function due to the solution X, is taken as fitness of X. Let it be f(X). Objective function is evaluated via fuzzy simulation process (using Algorithm 1 or Algorithm 2).(d) Selection process for mating pool: The following steps are followed for this purpose-(i)Find total fitness of the populationF=∑i=1Nf(Xi).Calculate the probability of selection piof each solution Xiby the formula pi=(f(Xi)/F).Calculate the cumulative probability qifor each solution Xiby the formulaqi=∑j=1ipj.Generate a random number ‘r’ from the range [0, 1].If r<q1 then select X1 otherwise select Xi(2≤i≤N) where qi−1≤r≤qi.Repeat step (iv) and (v) N times to select N solutions from old population. Clearly one solution may be selected more than once.Selected solution set is denoted by P1(T) in the proposed FSGA algorithm.(c) Crossover:(i)Selection for crossover: For each solution of P(T) generate a random number r from the range [0, 1]. If r<pcthen the solution is taken for crossover, where pcis the probability of crossover.Crossover process: Crossover taken place on the selected solutions. For each pair of coupled solutions Y1, Y2 a random number c is generated from the range [0, 1] and their offsprings Y11 and Y21 are obtained by the formula: Y11=cY1+(1−c)Y2, Y21=cY2+(1−c)Y1.(d) Mutation:(i)Selection for mutation: For each solution of P(T) generate a random number r from the range [0, 1]. If r<pmthen the solution is taken for mutation, where pmis the probability of mutation.Mutation process: To mutate a solution X=(x1, x2, …, xn) select a random integer r in the range [1, n]. Then replace xrby randomly generated value within the boundary of rth component of X.(e) Reinsertion operation:The reinsertion operation creates a very small number of solutions in the new generation. Reinsertion selects one of the solutions randomly using the selection process from the last generation and moves that to the new generation with no change. Using FSGA with suitable generating tools guarantees feasible area coverage but not optimality. Therefore in this study after producing the last generation, each individual in the last generation is studied to see if there is any local optimal in their neighborhoods. To do this, all the neighbor solutions to each individual are searched and evaluated successfully.A Winter-garment Merchant at Haldia, West Bengal, India, sells warm garments along with other normal garments. The duration of winter season in West Bengal varies every year and hence the business periods of the merchant differs each year. For the last twenty years, data regarding the durations of winter season were collected and the corresponding frequencies are presented in Table 2.With the help of these data and using least square approximation method, we constructI=min(∑i=17yi−λie−λihi)2and compute (∂I/∂λ)=0, to get mean of exponential distribution λ1=0.1001, λ2=0.1507. Identifying only two items – ladies and gents shwals, the corresponding input data are: M=2, p1=90, p2=110 C31 = 45, C32 = 55,C31′=40,C32′=45,C1h=10,C2h=15,C1p=2.5,C2p=3,C1b=4,C2b=5, γ1=0.05, Θ1=0.1, Θ2=0.2, σ1=0.06, σ2=0.08, R=0.25,k=0.05, α1=45, α2=50, β1=0.5, β2=0.75.To solve the stochastic model (Model-1), genetic algorithm (GA) (§6) is used and fuzzy-stochastic model (Model-2) is solved by FSGA (§6). First all the parameters of genetic algorithm should be defined. The corresponding parameters in GA and FSGA are POPSIZE=50, PCROS=0.2, PMUTE=0.2 and MAXGEN=50. A real-number presentation is used here. In this representation, each chromosome X is a string of m (here, m=2) number of genes, these represent decision variables. For each chromosome X, every gene, which represents the independent variables (here, T, T′), are randomly generated between their boundaries until it is feasible. In this problem, arithmetic crossover and random mutation are applied to generate new offspring's. Using the above mentioned GA and assuming Model-1 for the Merchants business, the maximum optimistic returns have been presented in Table 4.For the Model-2, we assume the resultant inflationary effect and deterioration rate are considered as a triangular fuzzy number i.e.R˜=r˜−k˜=(0.15,0.2,0.25)andΘ˜i=(0.08,0.1,0.12)for α1=50, α2=55, β1=0.75, β2=0.80, μ1=μ2=μ3=0.5 and all other data remain same as in stochastic Model-1 and the remaining data are in Table 3. The maximum optimistic returns are presented in Table 4.We have performed the different sensitivity analysis for the models Model-1 and Model-2 with respect to different inventory parameters such as demand, inflation, possibility parameters and mean of exponential distribution. The optimal values of T along with maximum expected total profit from the Eqs. (34)–(36) have been calculated for different values of αiand βiand results are displayed in Table 5.It is observed that as αiand βiincreases, expected profit increases due to the increase of demand. More-over for increasing values of αiand βi, both length of business periods and expected profit increase. All these observations agree with reality. A sensitivity analysis is performed for Model-1 with respect to different resultant inflationary effect (R) for deterministic inflation and results are presented in Table 6.It is observed that as R increases, profit decreases which agrees with reality.A sensitivity analysis is performed for the maximum expected total profit with respect to the different values of parameter λifor stochastic model and presented in Table 7.It is observed that as λidecreases profit increases. This happens because as λidecreases, expected time horizon increases which increases the total expected profit.Optimum results for Model-2 with different optimistic levels are evaluated and are presented in Table 8.From Table 8, it is revealed that, as the possibility level increases, total expected profit increases. This is as per our expected.In this paper, realistic stock dependent multi-item inventory models with shortages and partial backlogging have been formulated with fuzzy deterioration, inflation rate and set-up cost and learning effect in random planning horizon. Until now, no multi-item inventory model has been formulated with such considerations, i.e., multi-item, stock dependent demand, shortages with partial backlogging, effect of inflation, learning effect, deterioration, random planning horizon, etc in both random and random fuzzy environments. The proposed model is optimized via soft computing methods, GA and FAGA. The present concept can be extended to inventory optimal control problems for multi-product manufacturing system, etc, may be the areas of future research.
