@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Robust Generalised Cross-Validation was proposed recently as a method for determining near optimal regularisation parameters in inverse problems. It was introduced to overcome a problem with the regular Generalised Cross-Validation method in which the function that is minimised to obtain the regularisation parameter often has a broad, flat minimum, resulting in a poor estimate for the parameter. The robust method defines a new function to be minimised which has a narrower minimum, but at the expense of introducing a new parameter called the robustness parameter.In this study, the Robust Generalised Cross-Validation method is applied to the inverse problem of electrocardiology. It is demonstrated that, for realistic situations, the robustness parameter can be set to zero. With this choice of robustness parameter, it is shown that the robust method is able to obtain estimates of the regularisation parameter in the inverse problem of electrocardiology that are comparable to, or better than, many of the standard methods that are applied to this inverse problem.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The inverse problem of electrocardiology is an important and vital element in understanding the relationship between heart surface and body surface electric potential distributions. It essentially answers the question: if the body surface electrical potential distribution is known, what heart surface potential distribution gave rise to this observed body surface distribution? However, there are other formulations of the inverse problem of electrocardiology, particularly in terms of current dipoles. For a full review of methods for solving that particular inverse problem consult the excellent reference [1].To solve the inverse problem of electrocardiology as described above, one first needs to solve the forward problem of electrocardiology. That is, one needs to solve the partial differential equation for the electric potential in the torso, Φ, which is governed by(1)∇·σ∇ϕ=0,subject to the Dirichlet boundary condition on the heart surface,(2)ϕ=h(x,y,z)onΓh,and the Neumann boundary condition on the body surface,(3)(σ∇ϕ)·n=0onΓb,where Γhand Γbare the heart and body surfaces, respectively,h(x,y,z)represents some electric potential distribution on the heart surface, Γh, σ is the conductivity tensor within the torso andnis the outward pointing surface normal. The first condition assumes that there is a known potential distribution on the heart surface and the second says that the torso surface is insulated. Equation (1) is based on a quasi-static assumption [2], implying that the electric field in the torso responds instantaneously to the boundary conditions with the consequence that each time point can be considered independently.The governing Eq. (1) can be solved via a variety of numerical methods, including the finite difference method, the finite element method, the finite volume method and the boundary element method [3]. In each method, the forward problem can be reduced to the matrix–vector equation(4)Ax=bwherexrepresents the vector of heart surface potentials on the mesh points representing an approximation to the heart surface,bis a vector of body surface potentials and the forward transfer matrix [4]Ais dependent on the numerical method chosen to solve the forward problem.The inverse problem of electrocardiology uses Eq. (4) to findx, given a measured set of potentials on the body surfaceb(these are usually measured at a set of positions defined by a mapping system). Since the forward transfer matrixAgenerally has a large condition number, and is often not square, and there is measurement noise in the vectorb, the inverse problem is ill-posed in the sense of Hadamard [1]. Hence, in order to solve Eq. (4), Tikhonov regularisation [5], which seeks to find(5)minx{∥Ax−b∥22+λ2∥Lx∥22}is often used. HereLis a matrix that controls the smoothing of the potentials on the heart surface. It can be an appropriately sized identity matrix (zero order Tikhonov regularisation), an approximation to the gradient of the potential on the heart surface (first order Tikhonov regularisation) or an approximation to the Laplacian of the potential on the heart surface (second order Tikhonov regularisation). Also, λ is called the regularisation parameter. The solution to the minimisation problem (5) is then given by(6)x=(ATA+λ2LTL)−1ATb.The difficulty with findingxis that the parameter λ is unknown. It is meant to represent some balance between the size of the residuals in the forward problem (the first term in Eq. (5) and the size of some form of smoothing of the solution (the second term in Eq. (5)). Over many years, a number of methods have been devised to find “optimal” values for λ for the inverse problem of electrocardiology. These include, but are not limited to, the L-curve method [7], the CRESO method [6], the zero-crossing method [9] and the Generalised Cross-Validation method [8]. Many other methods for determining λ have also been proposed and a review of these methods in a more general context can be found in [10].There are also many other techniques for obtaining approximate solutions to the inverse problem of electrocardiology. The methods described above all utilise Tikhonov regularisation in some form, but generally ignore temporal variation. More general methods that include temporal variation have been developed [11–14], but these techniques still require some form of optimal regularisation parameter determination [15].Other approaches to solve the inverse problem of electrocardiology that do not rely on the ideas of regularisation include: treating the boundary conditions as a Cauchy boundary value problem [16]; using genetic algorithms [17–19]; using partial differential equation constrained optimisation [20,21]; using Twomey regularisation for wave-front based ECG imaging [22], and using Bayesian estimation [23].To motivate the Robust Generalised Cross-Validation (RGCV) method, it is instructive to consider the motivation behind the Generalised Cross-Validation (GCV) method itself. The original GCV method [8] can be interpreted as a weighted sum of squares of the prediction errors of the inversion procedure, leaving out each data point in turn. Analysis of this idea gives rise to the GCV function and will be discussed shortly. On the other hand, the RGCV method [24] uses a mean of the influence of leaving out each data point in turn. These means are then averaged to arrive at the RGCV function (also to be discussed shortly).The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: in the next section, the above methods for finding the regularisation parameter will be discussed briefly and analysed in terms of the singular values of the matrixA. It also describes the simulation protocols to be followed in this study. Section 3 will present results and comparisons between the different methods of choosing a regularisation parameter and Section 4 will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the RGCV method.
