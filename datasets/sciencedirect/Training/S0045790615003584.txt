@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Underwater transmission of acoustic signals is affected by several factors such as low propagation speed, signal attenuation, and multipath propagation. Moreover, strong multipath propagation develops because of the many reflections that occur between the surface and bottom boundaries and results in inter-symbol interference; this also badly affects the transmission process by limiting the data rate of communication. There are numerous applications for underwater acoustic information transmission, including the detection and tracking of submarines, tactical surveillance, disaster prevention, tsunami warning systems, and pollution monitoring [1]. The transmission of information underwater with the use of electromagnetic radiation has been found to be energy-inefficient in comparison to transmission using an acoustic carrier. When transmitted through an acoustic carrier, signals can suffer from distortion because of the presence of noise from natural sources such as rain, wind, and seismic activity or from other sources such as ships. For instance, Alkydiz et al. discussed the issues that underwater acoustic signal transmission must deal (with including distortion) for ocean environment monitoring systems [2]. A linear relationship between wind speed and noise spectra was reported in [1] along with the existence of a correlation between the noise level and wind speed. Karasalo I used the COMLAB software tool to develop a time domain model of turbo coded underwater communication; their results show that turbo coded systems achieve excellent bit error rates (BERs) even with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) [3]. However, considering the numerous receivers used in single carrier turbo coded systems, the observed results are very similar to the predicted communication performance [4]. Moreover, methods to minimize multipath propagation influences were discussed in [4], which suggested the use of a multi-carrier modulation technique; the inter-symbol interference effects in underwater acoustic transmission can be removed by assuming that the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol is longer than the multipath spread.The use of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems for underwater acoustic transmission can attain better spectral efficiency and higher data rates without additional bandwidth. The space–time block code (STBC) encoder and Vertical Bell Laboratories layered space–time (VBLAST) architecture are two methods through which the MIMO system can be explored. Each method has its own benefits and advantages. Higher capacity using spatially encoded bit streams is provided by the STBC architecture, which supports spatial diversity. In contrast, spatial multiplexing is achieved by the VBLAST architecture, which helps transmit varying bit streams from each of the various antennas, improving the data rate. Considering both spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing, a double space–time transmit diversity (DSTTD) type MIMO profile has been studied and discussed by various researchers [5]. The performance of DSTTD interleave division multiple access has been explained in detail in [6] which found that this system with the Block-Nulling detection method and iterative decoding algorithm achieves better BERs with lower SNRs. The authors in [7–9] demonstrated that turbo code with an iterative decoding algorithm also results in improved BERs with lower SNRs. In [10–12], it has been shown that multi-carrier transmission using the OFDM technique converts frequency-selective channels into flat fading channels and provides better BERs in multi-path environments with rich scattering.In this contribution, we use an OFDM to mitigate the effects of multi-path propagation in acoustic channels and DSTTD to enhance the data rate. We evaluate the BER performance of the proposed DSTTD-OFDM system by employing a Block-Nulling detection algorithm at the receiver and a maximum Log-MAP decoding algorithm to alleviate the effects of acoustic interferences and ambient noise.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the system configuration. Section 3 presents and discusses the performance results. Finally, our conclusions are drawn in Section 4.Fig. 1depicts the shallow water channel model for underwater communication with rich multi-path scattering. Fig. 2presents the transmitter and receiver structure of the coded DSTTD-OFDM system. We presume that the transmitter is equipped with Nttransmit antennas and each receiver is equipped with Nrreceiving antennas.The acoustic signals are first converted into a digital bit stream using an A/D converter. Let the acoustic data bit stream corresponding to the kth transmitter be uk. It is modulated by BPSK modulation and encoded by a turbo code. We implement a parallel concatenated convolutional encoder where the second encoder is preceded by a random interleaver. The output of both encoders is punctured to obtain a halved code rate.Let the channel encoder output be expressed as sk, where(1)sk=[sk1,sk2,…,skm]T,k=1,2,…,Kand m represents the number of bits in the serial bit stream. The serial bit streams are then interleaved to combat burst error. Further, letckbe the frequency domain transmitter-specific orthogonal spreading sequence corresponding to the kthtransmitter, where(2)ck=1N[ck0,ck1,…,ck(N−1)]THere, N represents the spreading length. The frequency domain spreading matrix Nm × m can then be expressed asCkwhere(3)Ck=diag{ck,ck,ck,…,ck}=Im⊗ck,k=1,2,…,Kand whereNm=N·m. The spread sequence can now be expressed as vectorx=Ckskof length Nm × 1. The bit streams are encoded by the DSTTD block. These bit streams output by the DSSTD encoder are multi-carrier modulated with the aid of Nb × Nb multi-carrier modulation matrixFgiven by(4)F=diag{exp(j2πf1t),exp(j2πf2t),…,exp(j2πfNbt}where Nb represents the block size of the bit streams from each antenna. Finally, cyclic prefixes are added to alleviate the effects of inter-carrier interference and then transmitted from the antennas.In this study, we calculate the BER performance of our DSTTD assisted MIMO multi-carrier system for underwater communication in multi-path channel environments based on the shallow water channel model [13]. Further, we consider an L tap delay [13,14] spread, as defined in Table 1. The fading co-efficient connecting the v-th transmit antenna and w-th receive antenna is given by(5)hwv(t)=∑l=1Lhwvl∂(t−τl)wherehwvlis a Gaussian complex random process with zero mean and variance ψ(τl).At the receiver, the cyclic prefixes are removed and multi-carrier demodulation is carried out using a fast Fourier transform block. We assume that the perfect channel state information is available at the receiver.AssumingNt=4, the Nr× 2 component matrix received after two symbol durations can now be expressed in compact form as(6)Rk=Hkx+ηwhere x is the Nt× 2 component vector, given by(7)[x1−x2*x2x1*x3−x4*x4x3*]Further,Hkis the Nr× Ntcomponent matrix, expressed as(8)[h11h12h13h14h21h22h23h24h31h32h33h34h41h42h43h44]ηis Nr× 2 component ambient noise vector, given by(9)[η1−η2*η2η1*η3−η4*η4η3*]and Rkis the Nt× 2 component vector and is given by(10)[r11r12r21r22r31r32r41r42]We considered the noise component to be the sum of shipping, turbulence, sea state, and thermal noise [15]. Shipping Noise is expressed as(11)NLShip=40+20(s−0.5)+26log(f)−60log(f+0.03)where s represents shipping factor. Further, turbulence, sea state, thermal noise are respectively expressed as(12)NLTurb=17−30log(f)(13)NLState=50+7.5w1/2+20log(f)−40log(f+0..4)(14)NLThermal=−15+20log(f)Hence, the total noise power density is(15)γ=NLShip+NLTurb+NLState+NLThermalIn order to apply the Block-Nulling detection algorithm, the received matrices are re-arranged [5] and expressed as(16)(Re)k=(He)kx¯+ηkwhere(17)(Re)k=[r11r12*r21r22*r31r32*r41r42*](18)(He)k=[h11h12h13h14h12*−h11*h14*−h13*h21h22h23h24h22*−h21*h24*−h23*h31h32h33h33h32*−h31*h34*−h33*h41h42h41h44h42*−h41*h44*−h43*](19)x¯=[x1x2x3x4]and(20)ηk=[η11η12*η21η22*η31η32*η41η42*]In order to simplify (12), we pre-multiply the equation by(He)kH. The resultant matrix can now be written as(21)(R¯)k=H¯kx¯+η¯kwhere(22)(R¯)k=(He)kH×(Re)k=[r1r2r3r4](23)H¯k=(He)kH×(He)k=[φ10αβ0φ1−β*α*α*−βφ20β*α0φ2]where α, β, φ1, and φ2represent the channel gain and are expressed as(24)α=∑z=14((hz1*×hz3)+(hz2×hz4*))(25)β=∑z=14((hz1*×hz4)−(hz2×hz3*))(26)ϕ1=∑z=14(|hz1|2+|hz2|2)(27)ϕ2=∑z=14(|hz3|2+|hz4|2)and(28)(η¯)k=(He)kH×(ηk)=[η1η2η3η4]Assuming the signal strengths of x1 and x2 are superior to those of x3 and x4, x1 and x2 are first detected [5] using the maximum-likelihood algorithm based on(29)x^i=argmin|φ¯i−(φ¯i×xi)|2xi∈{1,−1}where(30)φ¯i=φ1−(|α2|+|β2|φ2)Thus, the first STBC block unit is estimated. The second STBC decoding is then accomplished by detecting symbols x3 and x4 using the following expression [5](31)[x^3x^4]=[r3r4]−[α*−ββ*α][x^1x^2]Suppose the strength of the signals of x3 and x4 are found to be superior to those of x1 andx2. The STBC block comprising signals x3 and x4 are then detected initially using the maximum-likelihood detection algorithm based on the following expression(32)x^i=argmin|φ¯i−(φ¯i×xi)|2xi∈{1,−1}where(33)φ¯i=φ2−(|α2|+|β2|φ1)Subsequently, the second STBC block detects signals x1 and x2 using the simple expression followed by(34)[x^1x^2]=[r1r2]−[α*β−β*α][x^3x^4]The detected acoustic information is despread by a transmitter-specific despreading sequence and is de-interleaved. The de-interleaved bit streams are then decoded by the Log-Map decoding algorithm [16]. Finally, the estimated bit streams are converted into acoustic signals using a D/A converter.
