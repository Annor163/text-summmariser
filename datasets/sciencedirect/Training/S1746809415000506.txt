A permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity measure for EEG analysis

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
A complexity measure for EEG signal analysis is proposed which combines permutation and Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC).Robustness of PLZC was tested using a neural mass model, and PLZC was more robust to noise than four classical Lempel-Ziv complexity measures.Application to real EEG data showed that PLZC could better distinguish different anesthesia states and detect epileptic seizures.

ObjectiveIn this study we develop a new complexity measure of time series by combining ordinal patterns and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) for quantifying the dynamical changes of EEG.MethodsA neural mass model (NMM) was used to simulate EEG data and test the performance of the permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC) in tracking the dynamical changes of signals against different white noise levels. Then, the PLZC was applied to real EEG data to investigate whether it was able to detect the different states of anesthesia and epileptic seizures. The Z-score model, two-way ANOVA and t-test were used to estimate the significance of the results.ResultsPLZC could successfully track the dynamical changes of EEG series generated by the NMM. Compared with the other four classical LZC based methods, the PLZC was most robust against white noise. In real data analysis, PLZC was effective in differentiating the different anesthesia states and sensitive in detecting epileptic seizures.ConclusionsPLZC is simple, robust and effective for quantifying the dynamical changes of EEG.SignificanceWe suggest that PLZC is a potential nonlinear method for characterizing the changes in EEG signal.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Detection of dynamical changes of nonlinear time series is an important issue in physical, medical, engineering and biology sciences [1]. In mental and neurological disorders, structural changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) frequently indicate an underlying pathological process. Accurately capturing the transitions from a normal to an abnormal state can be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of underlying disease. For example, a reliable dynamical measurement based on EEG in anesthesia can give an important reference guide in assessing the anesthesia state of patients [2–4].During the last decades, a number of methods have been proposed to detect dynamical changes of physiological systems, such as the permutation entropy [5], the Lyapunov exponent [6], the Hurst exponent [7], the correlation dimension [8] and the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) [9,10]. Particularly, LZC proposed by Lempel and Ziv [10] and its derivatives have found numerous applications in characterizing the randomness of biological signals, especially in EEG analysis [11–14]. LZC evaluates the randomness of finite data-series by measuring the number of distinct sub-strings and their rate of occurrence along a given sequence. Generally LZC is easily affected by artefacts and should not be used in distinguishing deterministic chaos from noise [15–17]. Hence, traditional LZC algorithm should be improved.Recently, an ordinal time series analysis method was proposed by Bandt and Pompe [18] termed permutation entropy. The permutation entropy measures the irregularity of non-stationary time series. It considers the order relations between the values but not the values themselves. It has shown several advantages, such as simplicity, robustness and low complexity in computation [18,19]. Facilitated by these advantages, permutation entropy [5,18,20,21] and its derivatives such as permutation conditional mutual information [22] and permutation transfer entropy [23] have been successfully used in understanding chaotic systems especially in physiological systems. These motivate us to explore whether a permutation-based LZC method, namely the permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC) could better detect the dynamical changes in nonlinear time series like EEG.In this study, the PLZC algorithm was derived; then the performance of the PLZC was tested using EEG data generated by a neural mass model. Through application on real anesthesia and epilepsy EEG data, we found that the PLZC was more capable of extracting the dynamic characteristics in EEG signals. Several statistical methods, like the Z-score model, two-way ANOVA test and t-test, were used to verify the significance of the results.
