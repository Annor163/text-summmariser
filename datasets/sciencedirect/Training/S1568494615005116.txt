@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this study, an exact analytical inversion procedure is presented for interval type-2 Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy logic systems (IT2 TSK FLSs) with closed form inference methods. In this inversion procedure, the inversion variable is needed to be defined by piecewise linear interval type-2 fuzzy sets (PWL IT2 FSs). This provides a way to define an IT2 TSK FLS in a form that is composed of several fuzzy subsystems with respect to the inversion variable. In the proposed procedure, the output definitions of fuzzy subsystems are derived in a unique parametric form in terms of the inversion variable by using parameters of linear definition of membership functions. By rearranging this definition with respect to the inversion variable; either a linear, quadratic or cubic equation is obtained depending on the types of the inference method and rule consequents of the IT2 TSK FLS. Since explicit analytical solutions are available for these types of equations, the exact inverse solution(s) of each fuzzy subsystem can easily be calculated. The inverse solution set of overall IT2 TSK FLS is obtained by composing the inverse solutions of all fuzzy subsystems. The exactness and feasibility of the proposed inversion procedure has been illustrated through simulation examples.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The inversion approach provides a simple and effective way to design a controller especially for nonlinear systems in model based engineering applications [1–4]. Especially in an internal model control strategy, the inverse of a system model can directly be used as a main controller. However, there are two major drawbacks about this issue. First, it is not an easy task to find a feasible mathematical model defining nonlinearities and uncertainties of a system properly. Second, even though the mathematical model of a system is derived, it may not be invertible, it may be too complex to be handled or the inversion of a model may not be suitable to be used in control strategies since it is not physically realizable.Fuzzy logic concept which is introduced by Zadeh [5] is an easy and effective alternative to overcome above mentioned drawbacks in model based engineering applications. First, fuzzy logic systems (FLS) are universal approximators and they have an ability to approximate any nonlinear function with an arbitrary degree of accuracy [6–10]. Additionally, FLSs (especially type-2 FLSs) are capable of modelling and handling uncertainties in real systems. Second, there are various methods proposed for the inversion of FLSs (under particular limitations) in literature. Therefore, it is easy to obtain the inversion of a fuzzy model. Due to these important properties, the inversion of a fuzzy model is used effectively in model based engineering applications [11–16], especially in fuzzy internal model control structures [17–21].The concept of type-2 fuzzy sets is an extension of the concept of conventional type-1 fuzzy sets [22]. Type-2 fuzzy sets provide better performance for the modelling and handling uncertainties than their type-1 counterparts [23–26]. Because, type-2 fuzzy sets have additional design degrees of freedom depending on their secondary membership functions. When all secondary membership degrees of a fuzzy set are defined as equal to 1, this special type-2 fuzzy set is called as an interval type-2 fuzzy set. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets provide computational facilities and therefore, they are widely used in type-2 fuzzy logic system applications [27–32]. The type reduction process is the most time consuming task in interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems (IT2 FLSs) since it is performed by using iterative algorithms [33–37] (except for some special cases [38–42]). In order to remove the computational burden of the type reduction process, several closed form approximate inference methods were proposed for IT2 FLSs in literature [43–46]. Closed form inference methods provide effective performances in IT2 FLS applications [47–50] and they are more suitable for real-time implementations due to their computational facilities. Moreover, they provide a way to perform theoretical analyses for IT2 FLSs [51].Several inversion methods are proposed for FLSs in literature. A great majority of these methods are proposed for the inversion of type-1 fuzzy logic systems (T1 FLSs). These methods can be divided into two groups as approximate inversion methods and exact inversion methods [52]. In approximate inversion methods, the inversion problem is considered as an optimization or identification problem in general. In optimization based inversion methods, inverse solutions which minimize the error between the system and desired output are searched by using iterative optimization procedures [18,53–55]. On the other hand, in identification based inversion methods, the inverse fuzzy model is directly identified by using the reverse input–output data set of the system [11,56,57]. The main advantage of the approximate inversion methods is that they are not dependent on the fuzzy model structure since they only use the input output data of the fuzzy model. However, the sufficient convergence is difficult to be guaranteed for any nonlinear system in the approximate inversion methods.The exactness of the inverse solutions improves the stability and robustness performance of the application. Additionally, exact inversion methods are more suitable for real-time control applications since the solutions are obtained in an analytical way without the need of any iteration. Moreover, they may provide a way for the theoretical analysis of the designed systems. Several exact inversion methods are proposed for T1 FLSs in literature. The methods proposed in [12,58–61] use rule by rule inversion approach. These methods are applicable only for the type-1 fuzzy model having strong triangular input partitions, singleton consequents and a monotonic rule base. In [62], an exact analytical inversion method is proposed for decomposable type-1 Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy logic systems (T1 TSK FLSs) with singleton consequents. In [63], an exact analytical inversion of decomposable T1 TSK FLSs with singleton and linear consequents are proposed by using matrix multiplication form representation. Finally, in [52,64,65], an exact analytical method is proposed for more freely designed T1 TSK FLSs with singleton and linear consequents. In this way, the strong triangular partitioning which is the major limitation of the above mentioned exact inversion methods is removed. In this method, it is only needed that the inversion variable must be represented by piecewise linear membership functions in a fuzzy model.Although IT2 FLSs are more capable of modelling nonlinear systems with uncertainty than their type-1 counterparts, there are limited studies for the inversion of IT2 FLSs in literature. In [19,20] it is shown that inverse interval type-2 TSK fuzzy model controllers provide better performance compared to inverse type-1 TSK fuzzy model controllers in control of an experimental pH neutralization process. In [19], an approximate inversion of interval type-2 TSK fuzzy logic systems (IT2 TSK FLSs) is proposed. This method is based on instantaneous local linearization of TSK FLSs at a certain operating point. The proposed method in [20] is an optimization based approximate inversion method. Again here, since the inversion problem is considered as an optimization problem, there is no limitation on an interval type-2 fuzzy model such as types of antecedent and consequent membership functions and type reduction methods. However, again here, the sufficient convergence is not guaranteed. On the other hand, in [66], the exact inversion method is proposed for decomposable IT2 TSK FLSs which use Karnik–Mendel iterative procedure (KMIP) for the type reduction process. Since this method is the extended version of the method given in [62], it has the same limitations on the fuzzy model such as possessing strong input partitions and singleton type consequents. Moreover, the inversion procedure is also iterative since it includes the inversion of KMIP. Therefore, it has potentially high computation time depending on the iteration number.In this study, an exact analytical inversion of IT2 TSK FLSs with closed form inference methods is presented. Here, Nie–Tan (NT) [44] and Begian–Melek–Mendel (BMM) [45] closed form inference methods are considered due to their popularity and effectiveness. However, similar exact inversion procedures can easily be derived for IT2 TSK FLSs with other closed form inference methods after simple mathematical manipulations. In the proposed procedure, the inversion variable is needed to be defined by piecewise linear interval type-2 fuzzy sets (PWL IT2 FSs). In this way, the universe of discourse of the inversion variable can be divided into specific regions where only one linear piece of the upper and lower membership functions is fired for each PWL IT2 FS at most. This provides a way to decompose the IT2 TSK FLS into several fuzzy subsystems with respect to the inversion variable. In the proposed procedure, by using the linear definition of membership functions, the output definitions of fuzzy subsystems can be derived in a unique parametric form in terms of the inversion variable. This parametric definition provides a way to obtain either a linear, quadratic or cubic equation with respect to the inversion variable depending on the types of the inference method and rule consequents. There exist explicit analytical solutions for these types of equations. Therefore, the exact inverse solution(s) of each fuzzy subsystem can easily be obtained only by using the corresponding parameter values of each fuzzy subsystem. Then, composing the inverse solutions of all fuzzy subsystems, the inverse solution set of overall IT2 TSK FLS is obtained. Simulation examples are given in order to demonstrate the exactness and feasibility of the proposed inversion procedure.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, IT2 TSK FLSs with closed form inference methods are briefly explained. In Section 3, the proposed exact inversion procedure is introduced for IT2 TSK FLSs with NT and BMM inference methods, respectively. In Section 4, simulation examples are given in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed inversion procedure. Finally, conclusions are outlined in Section 5.An IT2 TSK FLS with n input variables, xk∈Xk, and one output variable, y∈Y, is described by fuzzy IF–THEN rules as follows [23,24](1)Ri=IFx1isA˜1iandx2isA˜2iand⋯andxnisA˜niTHENyi(x)=ϕi(x1,…,xn),i=1,...,M.where Ridenotes the ith fuzzy rule, M is the number of rules,A˜ki(k=1,...,n)represents the interval type-2 fuzzy set of input variable xkin rule i, yiis the output of the ith rule and ϕi(x1, …, xn) is the crisp function.Mostly, singletons and linear functions are used for the definition of rule consequents. The order of the rule consequent function ϕi(x1, …, xn) determines the order of the IT2 TSK FLS. An IT2 TSK FLS is named as zero order IT2 TSK FLS when singletons are defined for the rule consequents, that is yi(x)=ϕi(x1, …, xn)=ci. On the other hand, an IT2 TSK FLS is named as first order IT2 TSK FLS when the rule consequents are defined by linear functions asyi(x)=ϕi(x1,…,xn)=c0i+c1i⋅x1+c2i⋅x2+⋯+cni⋅xnwherec0i,…,cniare the coefficients of ith rule consequent function.The firing interval of the ith rule is defined as follows(2)fi=[f_i(x),f¯i(x)]where the lower and upper firing strengths are(3)f_i(x)=μ_A˜1i(x1)×⋯×μ_A˜ni(xn)(4)f¯i(x)=μ¯A˜1i(x1)×⋯×μ¯A˜ni(xn)Here,μ_A˜kiandμ¯A˜kiare the lower and upper membership functions of the kth (k=1, …, n) fuzzy set in rule i, respectively, and × represents the product t-norm operator. The state vectorxis defined as follows(5)x=[x1,x2,…,xn−1,xn]TThere are various types of closed form inference methods for IT2 TSK FLSs in literature. In this study, NT [44] and BMM [45] closed form inference methods are considered due to their popularity and effectiveness. The output of an IT2 TSK FLS with NT closed form inference method (IT2 TSK FLSNT) is given as [44](6)YNT=∑i=1M(f_i(x)+f¯i(x))yi(x)∑i=1M(f_i(x)+f¯i(x))The output of an IT2 TSK FLS with BMM closed form inference method (IT2 TSK FLSBMM) is given as follows [45](7)YBMM=m∑i=1Mf_i(x)yi(x)∑i=1Mf_i(x)+n∑i=1Mf¯i(x)yi(x)∑i=1Mf¯i(x)Here, m and n are adjustable parameters that weight the sharing of the lower and upper firing levels of each fired rule.In this section, the exact analytical inversion procedure of IT2 TSK FLSs with NT and BMM inference methods are presented for singleton and linear consequents cases separately.Consider an IT2 TSK FLSNT with singleton consequents of which output definition is given in (6). Without loss of generality, let us assume that the input xnis chosen as the inversion variable and it is defined by m PWL IT2 FSs as shown in Fig. 1. Any type of interval type-2 fuzzy sets can be used arbitrarily for the definition of the other input variables.The definition of the inversion variable by PWL IT2 FSs provides a way to divide the universe of discourse of the inversion variable into p specific regions with respect to vertices of the lower and upper membership functions of PWL IT2 FSs as shown in Fig. 1[52]. In this case, for any given xn, only one linear piece of each lower and upper membership functions can be fired at most in each region Pj(j=1, …, p). Therefore, the IT2 TSK FLSNT can be decomposed into p number of fuzzy subsystems with respect to the inversion variable. Since all lower and upper membership functions are piecewise linear in each region, the outputs of all fuzzy subsystems can be represented by a unique parametric definition. In this way, the output of any fuzzy subsystem can easily be calculated by substituting parameters of corresponding linear pieces of membership functions into this parametric definition. Thus, the inversion problem of the IT2 TSK FLSNT can be solved in a simpler manner by calculating inverse solutions for each fuzzy subsystem separately.In any region, the lower and upper membership degrees of xnis defined as follows(8)μ¯A˜ni(xn)=α¯A˜nijxn+β¯A˜niji=1,…,M,j=1,…,p(9)μ_A˜ni(xn)=α_A˜nijxn+β_A˜niji=1,…,M,j=1,…,pwhereα_A˜nij,β_A˜nijandα¯A˜nij,β¯A˜nijare parameters of corresponding linear pieces ofA˜niin the ith rule and the jth region. Then, the lower and upper rule firing strengths given in (3) and (4) can be represented as follows(10)f_i(x)=f_Xi(X)(α_A˜nijxn+β_A˜nij)(11)f¯i(x)=f¯Xi(X)(α¯A˜nijxn+β¯A˜nij)Here,f_Xi(X)andf¯Xi(X)are the product of the lower and upper membership degrees of input variables except xn, respectively(12)f_Xi(X)=μ_A˜1i(x1)×⋯×μ_A˜n−1i(xn−1)(13)f¯Xi(X)=μ¯A˜1i(x1)×⋯×μ¯A˜n−1i(xn−1)Therefore, considering (6), the output of jth subsystem of the IT2 TSK FLSNT can be expressed as follows(14)YNTj=∑i=1M(f_Xi(X)(α_A˜nijxn+β_A˜nij)+f¯Xi(X)(α¯A˜nijxn+β¯A˜nij))yi(x)∑i=1M(f_Xi(X)(α_A˜nijxn+β_A˜nij)+f¯Xi(X)(α¯A˜nijxn+β¯A˜nij))After certain rearrangements, the output definition of jth fuzzy subsystem can be rewritten as(15)YNTj=xn∑i=1Mfαiyi(x)+∑i=1Mfβiyi(x)xn∑i=1Mfαi+∑i=1Mfβiwhere(16)fαi=f_Xi(X)α_A˜nij+f¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij(17)fβi=f_Xi(X)β_A˜nij+f¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nijSince rule consequents are defined by singletons, that is yi(x)=ϕi(x1, …, xn)=ci, (15) turns to(18)YNTj=xn∑i=1Mfαici+∑i=1Mfβicixn∑i=1Mfαi+∑i=1MfβiThen, the inverse solution of (18) is easily obtained as follows(19)xnj=YNTj∑i=1Mfβi−∑i=1Mfβici∑i=1Mfαici−YNTj∑i=1MfαiAs it is seen from (19), if it is known that which fuzzy subsystem gives the desired output YNT, the inverse solution of the IT2 TSK FLSNT can easily be calculated by substituting correspondingα_A˜nij,β_A˜nijandα¯A˜nij,β¯A˜nijvalues into (19). However, since this is not possible and also more than one fuzzy subsystem giving the same desired YNTmay exist, all fuzzy subsystems must be evaluated separately to obtain possible inverse solutions. The calculated inverse solutionxnjofYNTjmust fall into jth region in order to be a valid inverse solution. After evaluating all fuzzy subsystems, the solution set S of overall IT2 TSK FLSNT is constituted by composing all valid inverse solutions. There can be unique, multiple, infinity and/or no solution(s) in the solution set [17,52,62,63]. The type of the valid solution depends on the values of the nominator and denominator of (19). If only the denominator is calculated as equal to zero, there exists no solution for inversion procedure, that is xn=n(.)/0→S={∅}. On the other hand, if both of the numerator and denominator are calculated as equal to zero, there exists infinite number of solutions which means that all values of xnin the corresponding region of the evaluated fuzzy subsystem provide inverse solution, that is xn=0/0→S=[Pj].In the case that there exist multiple and/or infinity solutions in the solution set S of overall IT2 TSK FLSNT, a selection operation is performed to choose the appropriate solution for practical implementations. Various selection criteria and their effects on inversion performance are given in [17].Consider an IT2 TSK FLSNT with linear consequents. The linear rule consequents can be rewritten as follows(20)yi(x)=Ci(X)+cni⋅xnwhere(21)Ci(X)=c0i+c1i⋅x1+c2i⋅x2+⋯+cn−1i⋅xn−1Then, by substituting (20) into (15), the output of jth fuzzy subsystem of the IT2 TSK FLSNT with linear consequents is defined as follows(22)YNTj=xn∑i=1Mfαi(Ci(X)+cni⋅xn)+∑i=1Mfβi(Ci(X)+cni⋅xn)xn∑i=1Mfαi+∑i=1Mfβiand after certain rearrangements, (22) is expressed as(23)YNTj=xn2∑i=1Mfαicni+xn∑i=1M(fαiCi(X)+fβicni)+∑i=1MfβiCi(X)xn∑i=1Mfαi+∑i=1MfβiBy using (23), the following quadratic equation in terms of xnis obtained(24)axn2+bxn+c=0where(25)a=∑i=1Mfαicni(26)b=∑i=1M(fαiCi(X)+fβicni)−YNTj∑i=1Mfαi(27)c=∑i=1MfβiCi(X)−YNTj∑i=1MfβiThen, the solutions of (24) are easily obtained by using the following formula(28)xnj=−b±b2−4ac2aAs it is seen from (28), in linear consequents case, there will be a pair of possible solutions for inversion procedure of each fuzzy subsystem. However, the calculated inverse solutionxnjofYNTjmust be real numberxnj∈X⊂ℜ(that is, b2−4ac≥0) in addition to falling into jth region in order to be valid. Therefore, the solution set of the IT2 TSK FLSNT with linear consequents consists of the solutions of fuzzy subsystems which satisfy these two conditions.It is important to note that if a=0, (24) is not a quadratic equation anymore and it turns to a linear equation as(29)bxn+c=0In this case, the inverse solution of the jth fuzzy subsystem is defined as follows(30)xnj=−cbAs it is seen from (30), in the case of a=0, the inverse solution definition of fuzzy subsystems of the IT2 TSK FLSNT with linear consequents is in the same form of the inverse solution definition of fuzzy subsystems of the IT2 TSK FLSNT with singleton consequents defined by (19). Therefore, the types of the obtained solutions depend on the same conditions derived for the IT2 TSK FLSNT with singleton consequents.Consider an IT2 TSK FLSBMM with singleton consequents, yi(x)=ϕi(x1, …, xn)=ci, defined in (7). By substituting (10) and (11) into (7), the output of jth fuzzy subsystem of the IT2 TSK FLSBMM with singleton consequents can be defined as follows(31)YBMMj=m∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)(α_A˜nijxn+β_A˜nij)ci∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)(α_A˜nijxn+β_A˜nij)+n∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)(α¯A˜nijxn+β¯A˜nij)ci∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)(α¯A˜nijxn+β¯A˜nij)After certain rearrangements, it is obtained that(32)YBMMj=m(k1xn2+k2xn+k3)+n(k4xn2+k5xn+k6)k7xn2+k8xn+k9where(33)k1=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nijci∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij(34)k2=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nijci∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nij+∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nijci∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij(35)k3=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nijci∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nij(36)k4=∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nijci∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nij(37)k5=∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nijci∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nij+∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nijci∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nij(38)k6=∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nijci∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nij(39)k7=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nij∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij(40)k8=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nij∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nij+∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nij∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij(41)k9=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nij∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nijIf Eq. (32) is rewritten, the following quadratic equation is obtained(42)axn2+bxn+c=0where(43)a=mk1+nk4−YBMMjk7(44)b=mk2+nk5−YBMMjk8(45)c=mk3+nk6−YBMMjk9Then the solutions of this quadratic equation are calculated as follows(46)xnj=−b±b2−4ac2aHere, the calculated inverse solutionxnjmust be real numberxnj∈X⊂ℜ(that is, b2−4ac≥0) and also fall into jth region in order to be valid.As it seen from (42), the obtained equation is in a quadratic form as in (24). Therefore, the types of the obtained solutions depend on the same conditions derived for the IT2 TSK FLSNT with linear consequents.Consider an IT2 TSK FLSBMM with linear consequents. By substituting (10), (11) and (20) into (7), the output of jth fuzzy subsystem of the IT2 TSK FLSBMM with linear consequents is defined as follows(47)YBMMj=m∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)(α_A˜nijxn+β_A˜nij)(Ci(X)+cni⋅xn)∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)(α_A˜nijxn+β_A˜nij)+n∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)(α¯A˜nijxn+β¯A˜nij)(Ci(X)+cni⋅xn)∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)(α¯A˜nijxn+β¯A˜nij)Then, after certain rearrangements, the following definition is obtained(48)YBMMj=m(k1xn3+k2xn2+k3xn+k4)+n(k5xn3+k6xn2+k7xn+k8)k9xn2+k10xn+k11where(49)k1=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nijcni∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij(50)k2=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nijcni∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nij+∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nijCi(X)+∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nijcni∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij(51)k3=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nijCi(X)+∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nijcni∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nij+∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nijCi(X)∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij(52)k4=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nijCi(X)∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nij(53)k5=∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nijcni∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nij(54)k6=∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nijcni∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nij+∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nijCi(X)+∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nijcni∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nij(55)k7=∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nijCi(X)+∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nijcni∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nij+∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nij∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nijCi(X)(56)k8=∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nijCi(X)∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nij(57)k9=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nij∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij(58)k10=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)α_A˜nij∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nij+∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)α¯A˜nij∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nij(59)k11=∑i=1Mf_Xi(X)β_A˜nij∑i=1Mf¯Xi(X)β¯A˜nijBy using (48), the following cubic equation is derived(60)xn3+axn2+bxn+c=0where(61)a=mk2+nk6−YBMMjk9mk1+nk5(62)b=mk3+nk7−YBMMjk10mk1+nk5(63)c=mk4+nk8−YBMMjk11mk1+nk5In the case that mk1+nk5≠0, the real number solutions of (60),xnj∈X⊂ℜ, are obtained as follows [42,67,68](64)xnj=−2psinh13sinh−1qpp−1−a3,p>0−2qq−pcosh13cosh−1−qp−p−1−a3,p<0andp3+q2>02−pcos13cos−1qp−p−1−n2π3−a3,n=0,1,2,otherwiseHere, p=(3b−a2)/9 and q=(2a3−9ab+27c)/54. Since (64) gives only the real valued solutions, in order to be valid solution, it is only needed that the calculated solutionxnjmust fall into jth region.On the other hand, if mk1+nk5=0, (60) turns to a quadratic equation as follows(65)axn2+bxn+c=0In this case, the coefficients of (65) become as follows(66)a=mk2+nk6−YBMMjk9(67)b=mk3+nk7−YBMMjk10(68)c=mk4+nk8−YBMMjk11Then, the solutions are obtained as follows(69)xnj=−b±b2−4ac2aHere, as in the case of (42), (65) is in a quadratic form as (24). Therefore, the types of the obtained solutions again depend on the same conditions derived for the IT2 TSK FLSNT with linear consequents.In this section, illustrative examples are given for the exact inversion of IT2 TSK FLSs with NT and BMM closed form inference methods. In the examples, inversion results are presented for singleton and linear consequent cases separately. In order to provide ease of the graphical illustration and understanding, a two-input-single-output fuzzy system structure is considered. Additionally, without loss of generality, the same antecedent interval type-2 membership functions are used for all IT2 TSK FLSs. The membership functions of the input variables x1 and x2 are shown in Fig. 2.Here, the membership functions of the input variable x1 are chosen arbitrarily as shown in Fig. 2a in order to illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed inversion procedure. On the other hand, the inversion variable x2 is defined by piecewise linear interval type-2 membership functions as shown in Fig. 2b. Depending on the vertices of the lower and upper membership functions, nine specific regions are defined on the universe of discourse of the inversion variable x2 as shown in Fig. 2b with dashed lines. Therefore, all IT2 TSK FLSs consist of nine fuzzy subsystems with respect to the inversion variable x2. The parameters related with the linear pieces of the lower and upper membership functions of PWL IT2 FSs,α_A˜2vj,β_A˜2vjandα¯A˜2vj,β¯A˜2vj(v=1, 2, 3), are given in Table 1for each region Pj(j=1, …, 9).The same rule tables are used for the IT2 TSK FLSNT and IT2 TSK FLSBMM. These rule tables for singleton and linear consequent cases are given in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The corresponding input–output mappings of the IT2 TSK FLSNT and IT2 TSK FLSBMM are shown in Fig. 3. In BMM inference method, the weighting parameters are chosen as m=0.6 and n=0.4.In order to show the exactness and feasibility of the proposed inversion procedure, the validation structure shown in Fig. 4[17,52,62,63,66] is used. In all examples, the input variable x1 and the desired output trajectory ydare chosen as a uniform random number and a summation of two sinusoidal functions, respectively. The minimal energy (minimal distance) selection criterion [17] is preferred for the determination of appropriate x2 solution from the solution set. This selection criterion ensures signal continuity by preventing abrupt switching.Let us consider a two-input-single-output IT2 TSK FLSNT with singleton consequents. The range of the input variable x1 is [1, 2] and the desired output trajectory ydis yd(k)=0.25sin(2πk/20)+0.5sin(2πk/50)+0.75 as shown in Fig. 5a and c, respectively. The resultant x2 solutions obtained by using proposed exact inversion procedure are illustrated in Fig. 5b. The corresponding system output y and the desired trajectory ydare compared in Fig. 5c. The exactness of the proposed inversion procedure is clearly seen from Fig. 5c where the error signal exactly equals to zero.In order to illustrate an example solution set graphically, in Fig. 7a, the output of IT2 TSK FLSNT with singleton consequents is illustrated with respect to the inversion variable x2 when x1=1.7. As it is clearly seen from Fig. 7a, the output of IT2 TSK FLSNT is composed of the outputs of all fuzzy subsystems. For example, onlyYNT2andYNT8fuzzy subsystems can provide solutions for the desired output yd=0.5. Therefore, for yd=0.5, the solution set consists of two solutions as S=[−0.68833, 0.62208] which are obtained from the inversion of these two fuzzy subsystem.Consider the IT2 TSK FLSNT with linear consequents. The range of the input variable x1 is [−1, 0] as shown in Fig. 6a. The desired output trajectory of the system is chosen as yd(k)=0.2sin(2πk/20)+0.4sinsin(2πk/50)+1.25, and it is shown in Fig. 6c. When the proposed inversion procedure is applied, the obtained x2 signal is shown in Fig. 6b. The comparison of the corresponding system output and the desired trajectory are shown in Fig. 6c. As it is seen from Fig. 6c, the system output follows the desired trajectory precisely.The graphical representation of an example solution set is given in Fig. 7b for x1=−0.6 and yd=1.5. As it is seen from Fig. 7b, in this case, onlyYNT3,YNT5andYNT7fuzzy subsystems can provide solutions for inversion procedure, and the solution set is obtained as S=[−0.57688, −0.07219, 0.41014].Consider the IT2 TSK FLSBMM with singleton consequents. Here, the range of the input variable x1 is chosen as [−1, 0] as shown in Fig. 8a. The desired output trajectory is chosen as yd(k)=0.25sin(2πk/20)+0.5sin(2πk/50)+1.6. The obtained x2 solutions by using the proposed inversion procedure are shown in Fig. 8b. The trajectory tracking performance of the IT2 TSK FLSBMM with singleton consequents is illustrated in Fig. 8c. As it is seen from Fig. 8c, the system output follows the desired trajectory with zero error.An example solution set is illustrated graphically in Fig. 10a for x1=−0.4 and yd=1. As it is seen from Fig. 10a, onlyYBMM3andYBMM7fuzzy subsystems can provide inverse solutions as −0.51192 and 0.36571, respectively.Consider the IT2 TSK FLSBMM with linear consequents. The range of the input variable x1 is chosen as [0, 1] as shown in Fig. 9a. The desired output trajectory is chosen as yd(k)=0.2sin(2πk/20)+0.4sin(2πk/50)+1.25. The obtained x2 solutions calculated with respect to ydand x1 signals are shown in Fig. 9b. The comparison of the desired trajectory and the fuzzy system output is given in Fig. 9c. As it is seen from Fig. 9c, the error signal equals to zero and the system output follows the desired trajectory exactly.The graphical illustration of an example solution set is given in Fig. 10b for x1=0.5 and yd=2.5. As it is seen from Fig. 10b, in this case, the solution set contains the solutions which are obtained from the inversion ofYBMM2,YBMM5andYBMM8fuzzy subsystems as S=[−0.73755, −0.06622, 0.71724].
