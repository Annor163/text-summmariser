Trends in celiac disease research

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Celiac disease is present in 1% of the population worldwide.Currently there is no cure for celiac disease.To determine celiac disease research focus, a MEDLINE search paradigm was developed.By detecting associations with celiac disease, research trends can be discovered.Certain areas of research are hot topics while others are less researched.Trends in research tend to follow the evolving symptomology of the disease.

BackgroundTo improve diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease (CD), research efforts are being made in many different areas. However, the focus, trend, and direction of such efforts require clarity, so that future efforts and directions can be appropriately planned.MethodIn this study, MEDLINE was used to search for trends in CD research. The keyword ‘celiac disease’ and its variants were searched in tandem with keywords commonly associated with CD. This search was done for each year from 1960 to 2013. Year of first instance of the associated keyword, linear regression coefficient, and trend in terms of the slope of the regression line were tabulated. For perspective, the same keywords were searched in tandem with ‘inflammatory bowel disease’ (IBD).ResultsCD appeared in the medical literature prior to 1960, and IBD first appeared in 1964. However, IBD overtook CD in terms of the number of research papers published per year, beginning in 1988. Keywords with strong positive trends (r2>0.7) in association with CD were: ‘diagnosis’, ‘gluten’, ‘serology’, ‘autoimmune’, ‘treatment’, ‘gluten-free diet’, ‘endoscopy’, ‘villous atrophy’, ‘wasting’, ‘inflammation’, and ‘microbiome’. The keyword ‘malabsorption’ had the sole strong negative trend in association with CD. Keywords with strong positive trends (r2>0.7) in association with IBD also had strong positive association with CD: ‘autoimmune’, ‘treatment, ‘inflammation’, and ‘microbiome’.ConclusionsThe MEDLINE search approach is helpful to show first instance, association, and trend of keywords that are affiliated with CD in published biomedical research, and to compare CD research trends with those of other diseases.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The diagnosis and management of celiac disease (CD) is a subject of intense study, with recent guidelines appearing in the medical literature [1]. The research in CD is diverse, involving pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and therapy. Characterization of CD is potentially extensive, as clinically the manifestations are diverse [2]. The quantitation of CD research data is desirable, including the potential for validation of a clinical prediction score [3]. However, it is difficult to assess severity of disease status because there is no severity index [4]. Population-based studies are useful in determining the risk of disease complications [5,6]. Clinical aspects of CD in areas of the world where it has not received great attention previously, including the Asia–Pacific region, is increasing [7]. In previous work, it has been shown that CD studies are increasingly common in the medical research literature [8]. The sharpest increase was found to have occurred since 1995. In terms of the global research effort for CD, countries including Italy, USA, and UK have the greatest volume of published studies [8]. Generally, the CD studies published in the medical research literature are of high quality and complexity [9]. Although CD research is gaining attention, research directions tend to be unfocused. Hence, it would be helpful to characterize trends in ongoing CD research so that areas of foci can be identified for future research.To improve diagnosis and treatment of CD, research efforts are being made in many different areas. However, it is not entirely clear where efforts are being made and therefore, what further efforts and directions are needed for future work. In this study, we sought to determine the trends in CD research in terms of the prevalence of readily identifiable keywords in the CD literature. As a comparison, we determined the association of these same keywords with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), since IBD is similar to CD in its clinical complexity and management difficulties.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The MEDLINE search technique was shown to be helpful to determine the relationship between keywords typically identified with CD in the medical literature. A technique that was developed to quantify first instance, association, and trends of keywords with CD in literature studies was successful for characterization of the relationships. From the graphs in Figs. 2–7, and the linear regression parameters of Table 3, it is evident that strong associations and strong trends exist in the affiliation of CD with certain keywords, and there are even a few strong trends and associations of some of these same keywords with IBD. By using this method of querying research topics in CD, one can see the differences in the clinical presentation of CD versus that of a malabsorption syndrome. One can also observe the trends in diagnostic methods and pathogenesis. The research also shows similarities between CD and IBD. Although there is approximately three times the volume of research in IBD compared to CD, the differences are quite prominent. There is more research on ‘treatment’ of IBD (Fig. 3), reflecting a major issue. Currently the gluten-free diet is the only therapy available for CD. However there is an interest among patients with CD for a drug therapy [29], and there are several drugs being developed [30]. One should see an increase in published research as a result. A surprising similarity was seen in the level of published research for keyword ‘malignancy’ in terms of similar significant trend (Table 3) for both CD and IBD. In clinical practice however, IBD patients, but not CD patients, are frequently screened for malignancy [31].None of the authors have conflicts of interest.
