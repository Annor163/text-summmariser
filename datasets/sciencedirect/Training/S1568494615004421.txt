@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aim of this paper is to develop a simulated annealing-based permutation method for multiple criteria decision analysis within the environment of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The outranking methodology constitutes one of the most fruitful approaches in multiple criteria decision making and has been applied in numerous real-world problems. The permutation method is a classical outranking model, which generalizes Jacquet–Lagreze's permutation method and is based on a pairwise criterion comparison of the alternatives. Because modeling of the uncertainty in the decision-making process becomes increasingly important, an extension to the interval type-2 fuzzy environment is a useful generalization of the permutation method and is appropriate for handling uncertain and imprecise information in practical decision-making situations. This paper produces a signed-distance-based comparison among the comprehensive rankings of alternatives for concordance and discordance analyses. An integrated nonlinear programming model is constructed for estimation of the criterion weights and the optimal ranking order of the alternatives under incomplete preference information. To enhance the implementation efficiency, a simulated annealing-based permutation method and its meta-heuristic algorithm are developed to produce a polynomial time solution for the total completion time problem. Furthermore, computational experiments with notably large amounts of simulation data are conducted to test the solution approach and validate the correctness of the approximate solution compared with the optimal all-permutation-based result.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problems address the ranking of alternatives and the selection of the best alternative among a finite set of alternatives based on a finite set of criteria with incomplete information [1,2]. The outranking methodology constitutes one of the most fruitful approaches in MCDA and has been applied in many real-life problems [3]. Specifically, the outranking model arranges a set of preference rankings that best satisfy a given concordance measure [4]. In particular, the permutation method from Paelinck's qualitative multiple criteria analysis [5,6] is a classical outranking model in MCDA. This method, which generalizes Jacquet–Lagreze's permutation method, is a metric procedure and is based on an evaluation of all possible rankings (permutations) of the alternatives under consideration [3]. Uncertain and imprecise assessment of information often occurs in practical decision-making situations [7,8]. Thus, modeling of uncertainty in subjective judgments and evaluation processes becomes increasingly important in handling MCDA problems [9,10]. Accordingly, an extension to the fuzzy environment is a natural generalization of the permutation-based outranking methodology. For example, Chen et al. [11] developed an intuitionistic fuzzy permutation method for addressing MCDA problems. Chen and Wang [12] proposed an interval-valued fuzzy permutation method and conducted an experimental analysis using cardinal and ordinal evaluations.Nevertheless, available information is sometimes not sufficient for the exact definition of a degree of membership for certain elements [7]. It is not reasonable to use an accurate membership function for a factor that is uncertain [13–15]. Therefore, type-1 fuzzy sets (T1 FSs) cannot fully address all of the uncertainty present in real-world problems [16]. The concept of type-2 fuzzy sets (T2 FSs) is an extension of T1 FSs [17,18]. T2 FSs are superior to T1 FSs because T2 FSs can model second-order uncertainties [19,20]. Unfortunately, the computational complexity of using T2 FSs is very high, which makes it very difficult to employ them in practical applications [21,22] (Zhang, 2013). Due to the high computational complexity of using T2 FSs, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FSs) have become the most widely used T2 FSs [23–28]. This paper attempts to focus on the permutation-based outranking methodology within the decision environment of IT2 FSs.In addition to considering the context of IT2 FSs, Chen et al. [29] developed an extended qualitative flexible multiple criteria method (QUALIFLEX) for handling medical decision-making problems. Wang et al. [30] introduced a likelihood-based QUALIFLEX method for addressing MCDA problems. Both the extended QUALIFLEX method and the likelihood-based QUALIFLEX method belong to the permutation-based outranking methodology based on IT2 FSs. Although the feasibility and effectiveness of the above-mentioned methods in the MCDA field have been thoroughly investigated and demonstrated, the main drawback of these methods is low computation efficiency in cases of numerous alternatives.In fact, the existing permutation-based outranking methods have an evident limitation because the solution for all of the possible permutations is an NP-hard problem. The permutation methods need to list all of the possible permutations of the alternatives. If the number of alternatives is not very large, for example, seven and ten alternatives, it would need to list 5040 and 3,628,800 permutations, respectively. It seems that a simple problem would be a complicated problem when the permutation methods are used. Furthermore, this paper has conducted a pilot study to investigate the average CPU time for generating all possible permutations of the alternatives. For each number of alternatives, ten trials were implemented using the MATLAB run on an x64-based PC with an Intel Core i7-4500U (1.8GHz) CPU, 8 G RAM, and an operating system Windows 7. The average CPU times for producing all permutations are 0.000953, 0.003609, 0.018750, 0.109375, 0.76875, 6.16875, 55.5, 556.23 (i.e., 9.27min), and 6100 (i.e., 1.69h)s for cases with three to eleven alternatives, respectively. Obviously, the average CPU times in the cases of ten and eleven alternatives are significantly high. In general, the number of permutations increases rapidly with an increasing number of alternatives. It directly follows that the computational complexity of the existing permutation-based outranking methods is evidently high in the case of many alternatives. Therefore, current methods will encounter great difficulties in a large-size decision-making problem. Moreover, this problem will be more serious within the IT2 FS environment because of sophisticated operations based on type-2 fuzzy logic. For the above reasons, this paper intends to develop a new permutation-based method in the context of IT2 FSs to overcome the difficulty of huge computations and to capture imprecise and uncertain information.Simulated annealing (SA) has been widely applied in NP-hard problems [31]. The SA is a meta-heuristic optimization method used to solve complex problems with large solution spaces and produces results close to the global optimum value in a short period of time [32]. This algorithm is well suited to solving large-scale and difficult optimization problems [33,34]. The concept of SA is inspired by nature and is derived from statistical mechanics [32]. The SA method emulates the solid annealing process, which first heats a solid to its melting point and subsequently slowly cools the material [35]. Specifically, the SA method is based on an analogy with thermodynamics and the manner in which liquids freeze and crystallize; moreover, the freezing process is guided by a cooling schedule that controls the decay of the system temperature [34]. The SA method has the advantage in that it avoids becoming trapped in local optima [36]. Thus, the SA method has become one of the most popular meta-heuristic methods and has been applied widely to solve many combinatorial optimization problems [35–37]. SA provides a suitable approach to solving the optimization problem in a wide range of applications [38,39] and is a stochastic optimization technique that converges on the global optimal solution. Therefore, this paper attempts to develop an SA-based permutation method to improve the computation efficiency and acquire a polynomial time solution.The purpose of this paper is to construct a new outranking approach, i.e., an SA-based permutation method, for solving MCDA problems under incomplete preference information within the environment of IT2 FSs. In the context of interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (IT2 TrFNs), this paper proposes the main structure of the permutation-based outranking method for addressing the problems caused by greater imprecision or uncertainty in MCDA. Instead of relying on a complicated computational process to handle IT2 TrFN data, this paper develops a simple and effective comparative method based on the concept of signed distances to differentiate the sets of concordance and discordance. The proposed method offers a flexible approach capable of tackling decision-making problems featuring conflicting information with respect to criterion importance under the incomplete preference structure. Furthermore, this paper provides an SA-based permutation algorithm for the solution approach to enhance the implementation efficiency of the proposed method, especially in case of many alternatives, and determines a polynomial time solution for the total completion time problem.This paper makes several significant contributions to the existing literature on the permutation-based outranking methodology in the MCDA field. First, we establish the fundamental structure of the SA-based permutation method based on IT2 TrFNs to address second-order uncertainties in decision reality. Second, compared to other existing permutation methods, the proposed method provides a flexible approach capable of manipulating incompletely known or even conflicting information about criterion importance in practice. Third, the proposed method uses a hybrid approach that integrates SA into the permutation-based outranking methodology to adapt to the MCDA problems within the interval type-2 fuzzy environment. Fourth, the difficulty of implementing computations for MCDA problems with numerous alternatives can be significantly overcome with the help of the proposed SA-based permutation algorithm. Fifth, the applicable scope of the problem size can be evidently expanded because the SA-based permutation algorithm can improve the computation efficiency and acquire a polynomial time solution. In contrast, the existing permutation methods can only be applied to MCDA problems with a limited number of alternatives. Finally, the computational experiments and the comparative analysis validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for applications. Thus, the proposed SA-based permutation method not only improves the established methods but also enriches the development of various permutation-based outranking methods, especially within the decision environment of IT2 FSs.This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the basic concepts of T2 FSs, IT2 FSs, and IT2 TrFNs. Section 3 formulates an MCDA problem in the IT2 TrFN framework and develops the SA-based permutation method under incomplete preference information. Section 4 conducts a comparative analysis via computational experiments to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. This section also consists of comparisons with other relevant methods and discusses the advantages of the proposed method. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions.Several of the relevant definitions and operations of T2 FSs, IT2 FSs, and IT2 TrFNs are briefly reviewed in this section. The membership grade of a T1 FS is a real number in the interval [0,1], whereas the membership grade of a T2 FS is a T1 FS with a support bounded by the interval [0,1] [18]. The membership functions of T1 FSs are two-dimensional and completely crisp, whereas the membership functions of T2 FSs are three-dimensional and fuzzy. The new third dimension of T2 FSs provides an additional degree of freedom and enables T2 FSs to directly model uncertainties [40–43]. Furthermore, the amount of uncertainty in MCDA problems can be reduced by using T2 FSs because they have the capability to tackle the problem of uncertain and imprecise information [44].Let X be a crisp set. A mapping A: X→[0,1][0,1] is called a T2 FS defined on the universe of discourse X; it is represented by [45–47]:(1)A=x,μA(x)x∈X,μA(x)=u,fx(u)u∈Jx⊆[0,1],fx(u)∈[0,1],where x is called a primary variable, and μA(x) denotes the fuzzy membership value of x in A. Note that μA(x) is also known as a secondary membership function or a secondary set. Jx⊆[0, 1] denotes the domain of fx(u) and represents the primary membership values of x∈X. Moreover, fx(u) denotes the secondary membership (grade), where u indicates the primary membership (grade) of x.IT2 FSs have a greater capacity to address linguistic uncertainties by modeling the vagueness and unreliability of information [13,14,48,49]. The computations associated with IT2 FSs are manageable [29,50], which enriches the development of various MCDA methods within the decision environment of IT2 FSs [21,27,51–56]). Next, we introduce some basic concepts of IT2 FSs.Let A be a T2 FS on X. When fx(u)=1 for all u∈Jx, A is known as an IT2 FS on X and can be represented by [45,47]:(2)A=(x,μA(x))x∈X,μA(x)=u,1μAL(x)≤u≤μAU(x),[μAL(x),μAU(x)]⊆[0,1],where μA(x) is referred to as an interval membership value.Let A be an IT2 FS on X. A can be fully characterized by its footprint of uncertainty (FOU), which is defined as the union of all primary memberships as follows [40,45,47]:(3)FOU(A)=∪x∈X[μAL(x),μAU(x)].FOU(A) is a bounded region that represents the uncertainty associated with the membership grades of A.A lower membership function (LMF) and an upper membership function (UMF) are two type-1 membership functions that are bounds for the FOU(A) of an IT2 FS A. Let two T1 FSs AL: X→[0,1] and AU: X→[0,1] be the lower and upper fuzzy sets, respectively, with respect to A. The LMFμAL(x)and the UMFμAU(x)are associated with the lower bound FOUL(A) and the upper bound FOUU(A), respectively, of FOU(A). They are defined as follows [22,45,57,58]:(4)AL=FOUL(A)=(x,μAL(x))x∈X,(5)AU=FOUU(A)=(x,μAU(x))x∈X,where0≤μAL(x)≤μAU(x)≤1for all x∈X.Let A be an IT2 FS on X. LetAL(=(a1L,a2L,a3L,a4L;hAL))andAU(=(a1U,a2U,a3U,a4U;hAU))be the lower and upper trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, respectively, with respect to A, wherea1L≤a2L≤a3L≤a4L,a1U≤a2U≤a3U≤a4U,0≤hAL≤hAU≤1,a1U≤a1L,a4L≤a4U, and AL⊆AU(if and only if ∀x∈X,μAL(x)≤μAU(x)). Let ζ∈{L, U}. The membership function of x in Aζfor each ζ is expressed as follows [30,59]:(6)μAζ(x)=hAζ(x−a1ζ)a2ζ−a1ζifa1ζ≤x≤a2ζ,hAζifa2ζ≤x≤a3ζ,hAζ(a4ζ−x)a4ζ−a3ζifa3ζ≤x≤a4ζ,0otherwise.The LMFμAL(x)and the UMFμAU(x)are lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the FOU(A) of A. Then, A is an IT2 TrFN on X (see Fig. 1for a geometrical interpretation) and is represented by:(7)A=[AL,AU]=[(a1L,a2L,a3L,a4L;hAL),(a1U,a2U,a3U,a4U;hAU)].This section first formulates an MCDA problem based on IT2 TrFNs in which the information on the criterion weights is incompletely known and the criterion values take the form of IT2 TrFNs. Applying a signed-distance-based approach, this section determines the sets of concordance and discordance for each possible ranking of the alternatives. This section develops the SA-based permutation method based on IT2 TrFNs under incomplete preference information used to solve the optimal criterion weights and the priority orders of the alternatives.Consider an MCDA problem based on IT2 TrFNs under incomplete preference information. Define Z={z1, z2, …, zm} as the set of decision alternatives, where m is the number of alternatives. Define C={c1, c2, …, cn} as the set of evaluative criteria, where n is the number of criteria. The set C can be generally divided into two sets, CI and CII, where CI denotes a collection of benefit criteria (i.e., larger values of cjindicate a greater preference), CII denotes a collection of cost criteria (i.e., smaller values of cjindicate a greater preference), and where CI∩CII=∅ and CI∪CII=C. Let wjbe the weight of a criterion cj∈C, which satisfies the normalization conditions. Let Γ0 denote a set of all weight vectors, and(8)Γ0=(w1,w2,…,wn)wj≥0(j=1,2,…,n),∑j=1nwj=1.Incomplete preference information is realistic in many practical decision-making problems [60]. The incomplete information about criterion weights can be generally constructed using the following basic ranking forms [61–65].(i)A weak ranking:(9)Γ1=(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0wj1≥wj2forallj1∈ϒ1andj2∈Λ1,A strict ranking:(10)Γ2=(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0wj1−wj2≥δj1j2forallj1∈ϒ2andj2∈Λ2,A ranking of differences (or strength of preference):(11)Γ3=(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0wj1−wj2≥wj2−wj3forallj1∈ϒ3,j2∈Λ3,andj3∈Ω3,An interval bound:(12)Γ4=(w1,w2,…,wn)∈Γ0δ′j1+εj1≥wj1≥δ′j1forallj1∈ϒ4,A ratio bound (or a ranking with multiples):Let Γ denote a set of the incompletely known information about the criterion weights provided by the decision maker. Because the preference information regarding the criterion importance may consist of several sets of the five basic ranking forms, Γ consists of the above five sets Γ1, Γ2,…, and Γ5. That is,(14)Γ=Γ1∪Γ2∪Γ3∪Γ4∪Γ5.Let us consider an example. Assume that C={c1, c2, c3} and the incomplete information about criterion weights provided by the decision maker is indicated as follows:w2≥w1,w2−w3≥0.2,w2−w1≥w1−w3,0.1≤w1≤0.3, and0.1≤w1≤0.3. Applying (9)-(13), it follows thatΓ1={w2≥w1},Γ2={w2−w3≥0.2}(δ23=0.2),Γ3={w2−w1≥w1−w3},Γ4={0.1≤w1≤0.3}(δ′1=0.1and ɛ1=0.2), andΓ5={w3≥0.6⋅w1}(δ″31=0.6). According to (14), the set Γ is obtained as follows:Γ={w2≥w1,w2−w3≥0.2,w2−w1≥w1−w3,0.1≤w1≤0.3,w3≥0.6⋅w1}.Decision makers often use linguistic variables to evaluate the ratings of alternatives with respect to various criteria [28,66]. These linguistic values can be represented with IT2 TrFNs in the IT2 FS context [26,27,29,60]. Let a non-negative IT2 TrFN Aijdenote the evaluative rating of an alternative zi∈Z with respect to a criterion cj∈C. Aijis represented as follows:(15)Aij=[AijL,AijU]=(a1ijL,a2ijL,a3ijL,a4ijL;hAijL),(a1ijU,a2ijU,a3ijU,a4ijU;hAijU),where0≤a1ijL≤a2ijL≤a3ijL≤a4ijL,0≤a1ijU≤a2ijU≤a3ijU≤a4ijU,a1ijU≤a1ijL,a4ijL≤a4ijU,0≤hAijL≤hAijU≤1, andAijL⊆AijU.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In the context of an IT2 TrFN framework, this paper proposed an SA-based permutation method for solving MCDA problems under incomplete preference information. This paper conducted an analysis of computational experiments to validate the correctness of the approximate solution compared with the optimal all-permutation-based result. As shown in the experimental results, the proposed SA-based permutation algorithm can indeed determine a satisfactory solution for the MCDA problems with large values of m in a short period of time. In addition to SA, selected heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches (e.g., tabu search, genetic algorithms, evolution programming, evolution strategies, genetic programming, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, etc.) can be employed to implement the proposed method. For example, Diabat [74] developed a hybrid genetic/SA algorithm to address the nonlinear problem. Future research can focus on the hybrid algorithm for solving the integrated nonlinear programming model for all m! permutations.More noteworthy is how to improve the performance of each criterion and dimension. In the current paper, the purpose of the proposed SA-based permutation method is to manage MCDA problems involving multiple criteria evaluations and ranking/selection of alternatives, not improving the alternatives. The proposed method can distinguish a relatively good solution from the existing alternatives in numerous practical MCDA problems. Consider consumer decision making as an example. Many consumers can scarcely improve the performance or correct the features of the existing alternatives in a specific product or service category due to lack of expertise, technical skills, or bargaining power with the vendor/manufacturer. Thus, the proposed method can still make a practical contribution to such MCDA problems within an uncertain and imprecise environment.However, the emphasis in the MCDA field has gradually shifted from ranking and selection of alternatives to performance improvement. Thus, future studies can discuss the applicability of extending the SA-based permutation method to investigate how to improve the alternatives. Additionally, Zavadskas and Turskis [9] and Liou and Tzeng [10] reviewed numerous MCDA methods and presented several novel concepts and trends in the MCDA field. These studies also afford perspectives on valuable future research. Thus, it is anticipated that the proposed method can be further improved in the future by incorporating these new concepts, including the use of aspiration levels, non-additive/super-additive models, and a systematic approach to problem solving [10].
