@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We present an algorithm for graph based saliency computation that utilizes the underlying dense subgraphs in finding visually salient regions in an image. To compute the salient regions, the model first obtains a saliency map using random walks on a Markov chain. Next, k-dense subgraphs are detected to further enhance the salient regions in the image. Dense subgraphs convey more information about local graph structure than simple centrality measures. To generate the Markov chain, intensity and color features of an image in addition to region compactness is used. For evaluating the proposed model, we do extensive experiments on benchmark image data sets. The proposed method performs comparable to well-known algorithms in salient region detection.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The saliency value of a pixel in an image is an indicator of its distinctiveness from its neighbors and thus its ability to attract attention. Visual attention has been successfully applied to many computer vision applications, e.g. adaptive image compression based on region-of-interest [34], object recognition [35–37], and scene classification [38]. Nevertheless, salient region and object detection still remains a challenging task.The goal of this work is to extract the salient regions in an image by combining superpixel segmentation and a graph theoretic saliency computation. Dense subgraph structures are exploited to obtain an enhanced saliency map. First, we segment the image into regions or superpixels using the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) superpixel segmentation method [18]. Then we obtain a saliency map using the graph based Markov chain random walk model proposed earlier [1], considering intensity, color and compactness as features. Using this saliency map, we create another sparser graph, on which k-dense subgraph is computed. We get a refined saliency map by this technique. The use of dense subgraph on a graph constructed from segmented image regions helps to filter out the densely salient image regions from saliency maps.A number of graph based saliency algorithms are known in literature that improvise on the dissimilarity measure to model the inter-nodal transition probability [1], provide better random walk procedures like random walk with restart [17], or use combinations of different functions of transition probabilities e.g., site rate entropy function [13] to build their saliency model. However, most graph-based methods produce a blurred saliency map. It would be useful to postprocess the map to filter out the most salient portions. Our model also being a graph based method, uses dense subgraph computation to filter out salient regions after random walk is employed. The suppression of non-salient regions combined with salient region shape retention, yields saliency maps more closely resembling ground truth data as compared to the existing methods used for comparison. This has been achieved by considering a more informative local graph structure, namely, dense subgraphs, than simple centrality measures in obtaining the map.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys some previously proposed saliency detection algorithms. Section 3 describes the proposed saliency detection procedures. Section 4 is devoted to experimental results and evaluation. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance when compared to well-known models, on standard image data sets and also preserves the overall shapes and details of salient regions quite reliably. Finally in Section 5, we conclude this paper with future research issues.
