Zhu et al. (2012) proposed dual hesitant fuzzy set as an extension of hesitant fuzzy sets which encompass fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, and fuzzy multisets as a special case. Dual hesitant fuzzy sets consist of two parts, that is, the membership and nonmembership degrees, which are represented by two sets of possible values. Therefore, in accordance with the practical demand these sets are more flexible, and provides much more information about the situation. In this paper, the axiom definition of a similarity measure between dual hesitant fuzzy sets is introduced. A new similarity measure considering membership and nonmembership degrees of dual hesitant fuzzy sets has been presented and also it is shown that the corresponding distance measures can be obtained from the proposed similarity measures. To check the effectiveness, the proposed similarity measure is applied in a bidirectional approximate reasoning systems. Mathematical formulation of dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions is presented. Two algorithms based on the proposed similarity measure, are developed to finds the optimal solution of dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated by numerical examples.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In 1952, Votaw and Orden [28] first proposed the assignment problems. It marked the beginning of the development of the classical assignment problem. Assignment problems are widely applied in manufacturing and service systems. Assignment is a special type of linear programming problem where the objective is to assign n number of jobs to n number of persons at a minimum cost (time). In classical assignment problems all the parameters are taken as crisp or precise, but in real life situations the parameters of the assignment problems are often imprecise rather than a fixed real number. The time/cost taken by a machine/person may vary due to various reasons eg., the job performance of a worker may correlate to the time taken to finish the task. Every worker needs a minimum time to perform an assigned task. Therefore, the time parameter behaves as an imprecise number for the decision maker. To deal with these type of situations Zadeh [35] in 1965, proposed the theory of fuzzy sets. Fuzzy set theory proved to be a useful tool to handel the uncertainty in real life problems.In recent years, fuzzy assignment and fuzzy transportation problems have received much attention. For instance, Lin and Wen [19] concentrate on the assignment problem where costs are not deterministic numbers but imprecise ones. The elements of the cost matrix of the assignment problem are subnormal fuzzy intervals with increasing linear membership functions, whereas the membership function of the total cost is a fuzzy interval with decreasing linear membership function. By the max–min criterion suggested by Bellman and Zadeh, the fuzzy assignment problem can be treated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and also they showed that this problem can usually be simplified into either a linear fractional programming problem or a bottleneck assignment problem. Huang and Zhang [8] proposed a mathematical model for the fuzzy assignment problem with restriction of qualification. The transforming model as certain assignment problem with restriction of qualification is set methods for judging the existence of solution for this problem is given by transforming the beneficial matrix into the decision matrix; furthermore, they transform the beneficial matrix into solution matrix when the problem has a solution and then the assignment problem with restriction of qualification is transformed into the traditional assignment problem. Jana and Roy [11] presented a new intuitionistic fuzzy optimization approach to solve the a multi-objective linear programming problem under uncertainty. The idea was based on extension of fuzzy optimization. They considered a multi-objective linear programming with equality and inequality constraints with intuitionistic fuzzy goals. Their fuzzy non-linear membership and non-membership function have been taken for the degree of rejection of objectives and constraints together with the degree of satisfaction. Then it converts the said problem into a conventional linear programming problem. Kumar and Gupta [13] chose some fuzzy assignment problems and fuzzy travelling salesman problems which cannot be solved by using the fore-mentioned method. Two methods were proposed for solving fuzzy assignment problems and fuzzy travelling salesman problems. Kaur and Kumar [12] proposed a new algorithm for solving fuzzy transportation problems using generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.Furthermore, Li et al. [16] investigated that numerous papers based on various search methods across a wide variety of applications have appeared in the literature over recent years. Most of these methods apply the following same approach to address the problems at hand: at each iteration of the search, they first apply their search methods to generate new solutions, then they calculate the objective values (or costs) by taking some constraints into account, and finally they use some strategies to determine the acceptance or rejection of these solutions based upon the calculated objective values. However, they pointed out that calculating the exact objective value of every resulting solution is not a must, particularly for highly constrained problems where such a calculation is costly and the feasible regions are small and disconnected. Moreover, in many combinatorial problems there are poor-cost solutions where possibly just one component is misplaced and all others work well. Although these poor-cost solutions can be the intermediate states towards the search of a high quality solution, any cost-oriented criteria for solution acceptance would deem them as inferior and consequently probably suggest a rejection. To address the above issues, they proposed a pattern recognition-based framework with the target of designing more intelligent and more flexible search systems for two real world cases of the assignment problem, i.e. the hospital personnel scheduling and educational timetabling. Mukherjee and Basu [23] set a mathematical models of the assignment problem with restriction on person cost depending on efficiency/qualification and restriction on job cost where both the costs are considered as intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Restriction of qualification is in the form of the maximum intuitionistic fuzzy cost which can be offered to a person depending on his/her efficiency/qualification. Also, Mukherjee and Basu believe that restrictions on the intuitionistic fuzzy cost which can be spent for doing a particular job makes the problem of intuitionistic fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions more realistic than the problems found in the literature so far. A heuristic method was constructed for showing the existence of the solution so that both the constraints are satisfied. Lin [18] constructed an algorithm to solve the fractional assignment problem based on parametric approaches. The algorithm performs optimization once and overcomes degeneracy and also the main features of the algorithm are an effective initial heuristic approach, a simple labelling procedure and an implicit primal-dual schema. Mehlawat and Kumar [22] studied a multi-objective multi-choice assignment problem considering cost and time objectives subject to some realistic constraints including multi-job assignment. They assume that the decision-maker provides multiple aspiration levels regarding both cost and time objectives using discrete choices as well as interval values. To obtain efficient allocation plans, they use multi-choice goal programming methodology to solve the assignment problem.On the other hand, the measure of similarity between two fuzzy concepts, as an important content in fuzzy mathematics, has gained attention from researcher for their wide applications in some areas such as pattern recognition, machine learning, decision making, real and market prediction, etc. In literature very large number of distance and similarity measures for fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy set have been proposed, for example Chen and Tan [4] proposed two similarity measures for measuring the degree of similarity between vague sets. De et al. [5] defined some operations on intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Szmidt and Kacprzyk [25] introduced the Hamming distance between intuitionistic fuzzy sets and proposed a similarity measure between intuitionistic fuzzy sets based on the distance. Dengfeng and Chuntian [6] also proposed similarity measures of intuitionistic fuzzy sets and applied these similarity measures to pattern recognition. Liang and Shi [17] proposed several similarity measures to differentiate different intuitionistic fuzzy sets and discussed the relationships between these measures. Mitchell [21] interpreted intuitionistic fuzzy sets as ensembles of ordered fuzzy sets from a statistical viewpoint to modify Dengfeng and Chuntian measures [6]. Hung and Yang [9] proposed another method to calculate the distance between intuitionistic fuzzy sets based on the Hausdorff distance and used it to propose several similarity measures between intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Liu [20] proposed some similarity measures between intuitionistic fuzzy sets and applied these measure methods in pattern recognition. Hung and Yang [10] proposed similarity measures by inducing Lpmetric. Xu [30] pointed out the the drawbacks of existing methods on measures of similarity between vague sets and proposed a new method on measures of similarity between vague sets. Lee [14] proposed a novel score function by taking into account the expectation of the hesitancy degree of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets and identified the best alternative in muticriteria decision-making problems by proposing a multicriteria fuzzy decision making method which deals with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Xu [32] introduced some relations and operations of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and define some types of matrices, including interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy matrix, interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy similarity matrix and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy equivalence matrix and also proposed a method, based on distance measure, for group decision making with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy matrices. Guha and Chakraborty [7] introduced a distance measure for intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and studied the metric properties of the proposed measure. Singh [24] proposed a similarity measure for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets by studying some properties of similarity measure and applied in pattern recognition and in bidirectional approximate reasoning systems.In 2012, Zhu et al. [36] proposed a dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFSs) as a extension of HFSs which encompass fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, and fuzzy multisets [34] as special cases, and investigated the basic operations and properties of DHFSs. Also, they gave the application of DHFSs in group forecasting. DHFSs consist of two parts, one is the membership hesitancy function and another is the nonmembership hesitancy function. The existing sets, including fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy set, HFSs, and fuzzy multi sets, can be regarded as special cases of DHFSs. The membership degrees and nonmembership degrees of DHFSs are represented by two sets of possible values. Therefore, it has the desirable characteristics and advantages of its own and appears to be a more flexible method to be valued in multifold ways according to the practical demands, taking into account much more information given by decision makers. However, the existing measures cannot be used to deal with distance and similarity measure between DHFSs. Due to the fact that membership hesitancy and nonmembership hesitancy are very common in decision making, therefore in order to find the optimal solutions of dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions, it is necessary to develop similarity measure for DHFSs. In this paper, a new similarity measure for DHFSs based on the membership degree and nonmembership degree has been proposed. Also, it is verified that the proposed measure satisfy the axiom definition of a similarity measure between DHFSs. Effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure has been tested in bidirectional approximate reasoning systems. Mathematical formulation of dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions has been introduced. Two algorithms, based on the proposed similarity measure, are developed to finds the optimal solution of dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section ‘Preliminaries’ discusses basic definitions of HFSs, DHFSs, ranking of DHFSs and some the existing distance and similarity measures for HFSs. Section ‘Similarity measure for dual hesitant fuzzy sets’ proposes new similarity measures based membership degree and nonmembership degree and, the relationship between distance and similarity measure is analyzed. In Section ‘Dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions’, mathematical formulation of dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions is presented and also a procedure to find the optimal solution of dual hesitant fuzzy assignment problem with restrictions is developed. In Section ‘Illustrative example’, a numerical example is taken to illustrate the proposed method. Finally, we conclude this paper in “Conclusions” section.In this section, we review the basic definitions of HFSs, DHFs and some existing distance measures for DHFSs.Torra and Narukawa [27] and Torra [26] firstly proposed the concept of a hesitant fuzzy set, which is defined as follows:Definition 1[26] Let X be a fixed set, a HFS on X is in terms of a function that when applied to X returns a subset of [0,1], which can be represented as the following mathematical symbol:A={〈x,hA(x)〉|x∈X},where hA(x) is a set of values in [0,1], denoting the possible membership degrees of the elements x∈X to the set M. For convince, hA(x) is called a hesitant fuzzy element denoted by h [33].Definition 2[26,27] Given a hesitant fuzzy element h, its lower and upper bounds are defined as h−(x)=min h(x) and h+(x)=max h(x), respectively.[26,27] Given a hesitant fuzzy element h, Aenv(h) is called the envelope of h which is represented by (h−, 1−h+), with the lower bound h− and upper bound h+.From this definition, we can obtain the relation between a hesitant fuzzy set and an intuitionistic fuzzy set, i.e., Aenv(h) is defined as {〈x, μ(x), ν(x)〉}, with μ and ν defined by μ(x)=h−(x), ν(x)=1−h+(x), x∈X.Definition 4[36] Let X be the fixed set, then dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) D on X is defined as:D={x,h(x),g(x)}in which h(x) and g(x) are two sets of some vales in [0,1], denoting the possible membership degrees and nonmembership degrees of the element x∈X to the set D, respectively, with the conditions:(1)0≤hD,gD≤1,0≤hDσ+gDσ≤1wherehD∈h(x),gD∈g(x),hDσ∈h+(x)=∪hD∈h(x)max{hD},andgDσ∈g+(x)=∪gD∈g(x)max{gD}for all x∈X. For convenience, the pair d(x)={h(x), g(x)} is called a dual hesitant fuzzy element (DHFE) denoted by d={h, g}, with the conditions: 0≤hD, gD≤1, 0≤hDσ+gDσ≤1 andhD∈h(x),gD∈g(x),hDσ∈h+(x)=∪hD∈h(x)max{hD},gDσ∈g+(x)=∪gD∈g(x)max{gD}From Definition 4, we can see that it consists of two parts, that is, the membership hesitancy function and the nonmembership hesitancy function, supporting a more exemplary and flexible access to assign values for each element in the domain, and can handle two kinds of hesitancy in this situation. The existing sets, including fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, and fuzzy multisets, can be regarded as special cases of DHFSs [36].Given a DHFE d, then some special DHFEs are defined as follows [36]:(1)Complete uncertainty: d={{0}, {1}};Complete certainty: d={{1}, {0}};Complete ill-known (all is possible): d = [0, 1];Nonsensical element: d=∅(h=∅, g=∅).Let d={hd, gd} be a DHFSs. Zhu et al. [36] introduced a score function sd, and accuracy function pd, of an DHFSs, which is represented as follows:(2)sd=1#h∑hd∈hhd−1#g∑gd∈ggdand(3)pd=1#h∑hd∈hhd+1#g∑gd∈ggdwhere #h and #g be the number of elements in h and g, respectively.Let d1 and d2 be any two DHFSs. Based on the score function s and the accuracy function p, Zhu et al. [36] defined the following order relation:(i)ifsd1>sd2, then d1 is superior to d2, denoted by d1≻d2;ifsd1<sd2, then d2 is superior to d1, denoted by d1≺d2;ifsd1=sd2, then(a) ifpd1=pd2, then d1 is equivalent to d2, denoted by d1∼d2;(b) ifpd1>pd2, then d1 is superior than to d2, denoted by d1≻d2.(c) ifpd1<pd2, then d2 is superior than to d1, denoted by d1≺d2.Xu and Xia [33] introduced the following axioms for distance and similarity measure between HFSs.Definition 5[33] Let M and N be two HFSs on X={x1, x2, ..., xn}, then the distance measure between M and N is defined as d(M, N), which satisfies the following properties:(1)0≤d(M, N)≤1;d(M, N)=0 if and only if M=N;d(M, N)=d(N, M).Definition 6[33] Let M and N be two HFSs on X={x1, x2, ..., xn}, then the similarity measure between M and N is defined as S(M, N), which satisfies the following properties:(i)0≤S(M, N)≤1;S(M, N)=1 if and only if M=N;S(M, N)=S(N, M).By analyzing Definitions 5 and 6, it is noted that S(M, N)=1−d(M, N), accordingly, Xu and Xia [33] mainly discussed the distance measures for HFSs.Also, they pointed out that in most cases, l(hM(xi))≠l(hN(xi)), and for convenience, letlxi=max{l(hM(xi)),l(hN(xi))}for each xi∈X. To operate correctly, we should extend the shorter one until both of them have the same length when we compare them. To extend the shorter one, the best way is to add the same value several times in it. In fact, we can extend the shorter one by adding any value in it. The selection of this value mainly depends on the decision makers’ risk preferences. Optimists anticipate desirable outcomes and may add the maximum value, while pessimists expect unfavorable outcomes and may add the minimum value. For example, let hM(xi)={0.1, 0.2, 0.3}, hN(xi)={0.4, 0.5}, and l(hM(xi))>l(hN(xi)). To operate correctly, we should extend hN(xi) to hN(xi)={0.4, 0.4, 0.5} until it has the same length of hM(xi), the optimist may extend hN(xi) as hN(xi)={0.4, 0.5, 0.5} and the pessimist may extend it as hN(xi)={0.4, 0.4, 0.5}. Although the results may be different if we extend the shorter one by adding different values, this is reasonable because the decision makers’ risk preferences can directly influence the final decision.Based on the well known Hamming distance and Euclidean distance, Xu and Xia [33] proposed the following distance measures:(1) Hesitant normalized Hamming distance:dhnh(M,N)=1n∑i=1n1lxi∑j=1lxi|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|(2) Hesitant normalized Euclidean distance:dhne(M,N)=1n∑i=1n(1lxi∑j=1lxi|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|)21/2(3) Generalized hesitant normalized distance:dghn(M,N)=1n∑i=1n(1lxi∑j=1lxi|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|)λ1/λ,λ>0wherehMσ(j)(xi)andhNσ(j)(xi)are the largest values in hM(xi) and hN(xi), respectively.On applying the Hausdroff metric to the distance measure the following distance measures were proposed:(4) Generalized hesitant normalized Hausdroff distancedghnh(M,N)=1n∑i=1nmaxj|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|λ1/λ(5) Specially, if λ=1 the hesitant normalized Hamming-Hausdorff distance obtained as:dhnhh(M,N)=1n∑i=1nmaxj|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|(6) If If λ=2, a hesitant normalized Euclidean-Hausdorff distance obtained as:dhneh(M,N)=1n∑i=1nmaxj|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|21/2Combining the above equations, Xu and Xia [33] proposed a hybrid hesitant normalized Hamming distance, a hybrid hesitant normalized Euclidean distance and a generalized hybrid hesitant normalized distance:(7)dhhne(M,N)=12n∑i=1n1lxi∑j=1lxi|hMσ(j)((xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|+maxj|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|(8)dghne(M,N)=12n∑i=1n1lxi∑j=1lxi|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|2+maxj|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|21/2(9)dhhnh(M,N)=12n∑i=1n1lxi∑j=1lxi|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|λ+maxj|hMσ(j)(xi)−hNσ(j)(xi)|21/λ
