@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Ant-tree is a clustering algorithm inspired by biological ants. This paper defines a variant of such algorithm to perform colour quantization. Some of the features of the basic Ant-tree have been adapted to obtain a quicker algorithm and to perform the main steps of colour quantization on a big input set. The centroid of every cluster defines a colour of the palette and once the complete colour palette is established, the algorithm represents each pixel of the original image by the colour associated to its cluster.Computational results show that the error obtained for the quantized images is smaller than the error generated by some other well-known quantization methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Let us consider an image with n pixels, organised in a rows and b columns. In the RGB colour space, each pixel, pijwith i∈[1, a], j∈[1, b], is defined by three values for the primary colours red, green and blue, pij=(Rij, Gij, Bij), with Rij, Gijand Bijtaking integer values from 0 to 255.Colour quantization attempts to reduce the number of colours of an image by two basic operations: the definition of a colour palette and the association of a colour of the new palette to every point of the original image. The colour palette includes a set of representative colours smaller than the original image, selected in a way that the quantized image differs as little as possible from the original image.Colour quantization is useful for tasks such as displaying images on devices with a limited number of colours, or also reducing the size of images to store or transmit them.The techniques proposed for colour quantization can be classified into splitting algorithms and clustering-based algorithms.Splitting algorithms divide the colour space of the original image into disjointed regions. An iterative process is applied until the desired number of colours is obtained; then, the colours of the palette are defined by the representative colour of each region. Methods of this type are Median-cut [1], Variance-based algorithm [2], Octree [3], Binary splitting [4], and Wu's methods [5,6].Clustering-based algorithms define clusters or groups of pixels in such a way that pixels into the same group are more similar among them than with pixels belonging to other groups. The colour that represents each group defines a colour into the palette. There are several clustering algorithms adapted to colour quantization, like k-means [7,8], competitive learning [9–11], fuzzy c-means [12], neural networks [13,14], or artificial ants [15].The Ant-tree (AT) is a clustering algorithm based on the self-assembly behaviour of real ants [16,54], which has been applied to several clustering problems [17]. This paper proposes to adapt this algorithm for colour quantization, so as the two basic steps of colour quantization are performed: palette definition and quantized image generation. This task requires taking into account the size of the input data, to prevent the algorithm being very time-consuming.The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description of the basic methods in colour quantization and it also includes a description of ant-based clustering methods, Section 3 summarizes the operating of the Ant-tree algorithm, Section 4 describes the variant of the algorithm proposed for colour quantization and finally, computational results are reported in Section 5, while Section 6 presents the conclusions.
