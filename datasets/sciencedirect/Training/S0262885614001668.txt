@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The increasing demand for security leads to a growing need for surveillance in many environments [1]. This includes installations of vast closed circuit TV (CCTV) systems; at the time of writing, London Underground has more than 12,000, and a typical casino in Las Vegas has more than 2000 surveillance cameras. Since visual sensors generate large amount of data, scalability becomes important, which gives rise to solutions based on distributed architectures — distributed camera networks. Computer-vision-based methods in camera networks are useful for different tasks, such as object detection and tracking, recognition of problematic or unlawful behavior, and re-identification of objects of interest. In this paper, we focus on the problem of re-identification [2–6], which is the process of finding correspondences between images of an object, acquired at different moments in possibly different camera views.Visual sensor networks (VSNs) may provide relatively large amount of computing and storage resources, but these are typically, both spatially and topologically distant, and the computational capability of an individual node may be low to reduce per-node cost or preserve energy [7]. Consequently, random access to a distant resource may be prohibitively expensive in terms of required network bandwidth, especially in wireless multi-hop networks. While this may be trivially alleviated by replicating all data and processing across all nodes, this defeats the purpose of a distributed architecture and does not solve the polynomially-increasing communication burden. In a truly distributed system, both re-identification and learning are expensive operations; the input data appears randomly at multiple nodes, thus requiring constant exchange with all other nodes, which may or may not have relevant information about object's identity.We present a holistic approach towards object re-identification in distributed camera networks, which specifically addresses the issues of distributed environments. Specifically, we claim the following contributions:•Formalization of object re-identification problem in a distributed environment.Treatment of re-identification as an open-world problem, with novelty detection and forgetting.A set of performance measures that specifically address issues in open-world distributed surveillance.Reproducible experiments on a many-camera surveillance dataset (“Dana36”, [8]), 8-camera SAIVT-SoftBio dataset [9] and publicly available experimental source code.11The full source code can be downloaded from: http://vision.fe.uni-lj.si/research/reid/.The code reproduces all results and graphs from this paper. Researchers are encouraged to use it for rapid evaluation of their descriptors or datasets, evaluation of parameter influence and learning and forgetting strategies.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After the overview of related work in Section 2, we explain the concept of re-identification in large, distributed camera networks in Section 3. The core of the proposed re-identification mechanism and the experimental methods we used are presented in Section 4, followed by experiments and results in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.
