@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A skeleton provides a synthetic and thin representation of three dimensional objects, and is useful for shape description and recognition. In this paper, a novel 3D skeleton algorithm is proposed based on neutrosophic cost function. Firstly, the distance transform is used to a 3D volume, and the distance matrix is obtained for each voxel in the volume. The ridge points are identified based on their distance transform values and are used as the candidates for the skeleton. Then, a novel cost function, namely neutrosophic cost function (NCF) is proposed based on neutrosophic set, and is utilized to define the cost between each ridge points. Finally, a shortest path finding algorithm is used to identify the optimum path in the 3D volume with least cost, in which the costs of paths are calculated using the new defined NCF. The optimum path is treated as the skeleton of the 3D volume. A variety of experiments have been conducted on different 3D volume. The experimental results demonstrate the better performance of the proposed method. It can identify the skeleton for different volumes with high accuracy. In addition, the proposed method is robust to the noise on the volume. This advantage will lead it to wide application in the skeleton detection applications in the real world.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A skeleton is defined as the locus of the centers of maximally inscribed balls [1]. It can serve as a representation of the shape, and it contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the shape. Skeletons have been used in several applications in computer vision, image analysis, and digital image processing, including optical character recognition, fingerprint recognition, visual inspection, pattern recognition, binary image compression, and protein folding [2].In a three dimensional (3D) volume, a skeleton generally consists of both curves and surfaces. It provides a synthetic and thin representation of objects. The 3D skeleton algorithm can be applied into computer vision, 3D object feature extraction, object recognition and tracking, shape recognition and retrieval, 3D surface reconstruction, automatic medical navigation and visualization, and geometric modeling [3,4]. Especially, it plays an important role in computer assisted navigation and surgery.A 3D skeleton is a collection of points, lines, and surfaces [4,5]. A skeleton is closely related to the centerline. A skeleton is a one-dimensional object (a set of curves embedded in 3D) which captures a 3D object's main symmetry axes, but does not contain detailed information about the object boundary. Skeletons provide a compact, efficient, and simple description for tubular structures such as blood vessels [6], neurons, or elongated organs such as the human colon [7,8].A number of skeleton algorithms have been proposed for the 3D voxel volume, and most of them can be categorized into three classes [4]: topological thinning, distance transform based, and polygon based methods. We focus here on voxel based volume in this paper. Therefore, we only discuss the first two classes.The topological thinning methods extract the skeleton [9,10] through iteratively removing its simple points from the boundary of a voxel set, which does not alter the object topology [4]. The skeleton is extracted using the distance field [11] or a refined geodesic field [12] in the 3D volume. Thinning method produces a connected and one-voxel thick structure [9,13]. However, it might lead to many undesired small branches [4].The distance based methods compute the volume's distance transform value and define the skeleton as a set of the local maxima on the distance transform values. This definition produces surface skeletons, not a one dimensional centerline. The skeletons are usually disconnected, not guaranteed to be one voxel thick, and sensitive to boundary noise [4]. Zhou et al. [14] connect the directly extracted local maxima by local maximum paths. However, this method is still sensitive to the noise. Moreover, the local maximum extraction might produce surface skeletons and not centerlines.Several distance transform based methods were proposed to trade speed for precision such as Chamfer-based [15], level-set based [16], and true Euclidean [17]. Zhou et al. used a second distance field to encode the distance to a given seed voxel set [8]. All voxels with the same second distance field value and the one having maximal distance transform value are added to the centerline. Bitter et al. [18] computed the gradient on the distance transform and found voxels on and close to the centerline by analyzing the gradient's local variations, followed by the reconnection of these structures. The final centerline is computed by applying various cost-based path tracing methods on the connected set of extracted voxels. However, this algorithm does not handle objects with branches or holes. It is also not very clear how sensitive the algorithm is to the distance transform gradient value.In the existing methods, some of them are time-consuming and sensitive to noise, and skeletons obtained by them are not single voxel. In this paper, to overcome the above disadvantages, we propose a 3D skeleton algorithm based on neutrosophic set. The skeleton is single voxel curve and immune to noise. At first, a distance map is obtained using a 3D distance transform, and a ridge point set is defined in the distance map. Then a cost function of each ridge point is defined based on the true and indeterminacy value in neutrosphic set. Finally, the skeleton is found as the lowest cost path between different ridge points.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed method, Section 3 discusses the experimental results and comparisons, and the conclusions are drawn in Section 4.
