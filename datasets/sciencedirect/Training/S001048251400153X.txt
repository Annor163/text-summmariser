@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundThe action potential duration (APD) and the conduction velocity (CV) restitution have been reported to be important in the maintenance and conversion of ventricular fibrillation (VF), whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. Multiple-wavelet and/or mother-rotor have been regarded as the main VF mechanisms, and APD restitution (APDR) and CV restitution (CVR) properties are involved in the mutual conversion or transition between VF and ventricular tachycardia (VT).Methods and resultsThe effects of APDR (both its slope and heterogeneity) and CVR on VF organization and conversion were examined using a “rule-based” whole-heart model. The results showed that different organizations of simulated VF were manifestations of different restitution configurations. Multiple-wavelet and mother-rotor VF mechanisms could recur in models with steep and heterogeneous APDR, respectively. Suppressing the excitability either decreased or increased the VF complexity under the steep or shallow APDR, respectively. The multiple-wavelet VF changed into a VT in response to a flattening of the APDR, and the VT degenerated into a mother-rotor VF due to the APDR heterogeneity.ConclusionsOur results suggest that the mechanisms of VF are tightly related to cardiac restitution properties. From a viewpoint of the “rule-based” whole-heart model, our work supports the hypothesis that the synergy between APDR and CVR contributes to transitions between multiple-wavelet and mother-rotor mechanisms in the VF.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major clinical and public health problem in many countries. SCD claims over 300,000 lives annually in the United States alone [1]. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is notorious as one of the most common causes of SCD [2], but knowledge about VF׳s underlying mechanisms remains incomplete [3]. It is generally considered that there are two major but contradictory hypotheses on the mechanisms of VF [3–4]: the multiple-wavelet [5] and mother-rotor [6] hypotheses. In addition, the mechanism(s) responsible for the degeneration from reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) to VF, conventionally believed to be due to a different mechanism, is not fully understood, either [7].Weiss et al. [8] in 1999 hypothesized that both the action potential duration (APD) restitution and the conduction velocity (CV) restitution characteristics may be related to the wavelength oscillation that led to wave break, a phenomenon that may convert VT to VF. Clinical studies have either demonstrated [9] or implied [10] that the APD restitution (APDR) is also tightly related to the risk of VF induction. Based on Weiss et al.׳s hypothesis, Wu et al. [11] further postulated that both APDR and CV restitution (CVR) were important in VF maintenance, and tested this supposition in experiments using rabbit hearts infused with methoxyverapamil (D600). They found that there were two distinct types of VF during the perfusion of D600 with increasing concentrations: starting from Type 1 VF, then to VT, and finally to Type 2 VF. The Type 1 VF is associated with a steep APDR and a flat CVR, comparable with multiple-wavelet VF. The VT was associated with a flat APDR and a flat CVR. The Type 2 VF was associated with a flat APDR and a steep CVR with a broader CV span, comparable with a mother-rotor VF. Each restitution configuration was associated with a perfusion of D600 at a given concentration. Wu et al. also simulated the transitions from Type 1 VF to VT, to Type 2 VF in a three-dimensional cardiac tissue slab [12].Since the shape of the real heart is not a slab, the hypothesis tested by simulations in a cardiac tissue slab [12], that the space-time dependent APDR and CVR can significantly influence VF organization and conversion, needs further validation using whole-heart model with a realistic heart shape, because anatomical features can significantly influence wave instability [13]. If both APDR and CVR are indeed important determinants of VF behavior, the manifestations of VF induced in models with some APDR and CVR could reflect these restitution properties. Moreover, the multiple-wavelet VF and the mother-rotor VF and VT would be simulated in models with the corresponding restitution configurations. Furthermore, the transitions from multiple-wavelet VF to VT, to mother-rotor VF from restitution alterations could also be simulated.Several studies based on whole-heart models investigated the relationship between cardiac restitutions and VF organization. Xie et al. [13] investigated the influence of the APDR slope on VF patterns in a canine ventricular model (by varying the parameter that controls the Ca2+ current amplitude, Gsi), but didn׳t investigate the effect of the CVR on VF. ten Tusscher et al. [14] tested several factors, including excitability and APDR that determine the number of rotors during VF. Nevertheless, the effects of these factors were only studied individually without investigating the combined action of APDR and CVR in influencing the VF organization. Keldermann et al. [15] have successfully reproduced both multiple-wavelet and mother-rotor VF in a detailed human ventricular model. However, they only investigated the effects of APDR heterogeneity and VF-induction sites on the VF dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, few simulation studies based on a human whole-heart model have been implemented so far to verify the deduction that multiple-wavelet VF, VT, and mother-rotor VF are probably just the different appearances of corresponding APDR and CVR properties, and their mutual conversions are due to changes in restitution. The purpose of this study was to check the role of APDR and CVR in exploring the mechanism of VF [8].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, different types of VF in models with different APDR and CVR setups were simulated using the Wei–Harumi model. Our simulation results suggest that the mechanism of VF has a tight relationship with the cardiac restitution properties. It is likely that the conventional mechanisms of VF can all be explained by the restitution mechanism. In addition, our work supports the hypothesis that the synergy between the APDR (its slope and heterogeneity) and CVR contributes to transitions between multiple-wavelet and mother-rotor mechanisms in the VF. We believe that the results from our simulation study based on a whole-heart model may be significant in understanding the mechanisms of VF, and complement “reaction–diffusion” model-based and experimental studies.None declared.
