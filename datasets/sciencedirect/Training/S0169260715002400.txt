@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Automated fracture detection is an essential part of a computer-aided tele-medicine system. In this paper, we have proposed a unified technique for the detection and evaluation of orthopaedic fractures in long-bone digital X-ray image. We have also developed a software tool that can be conveniently used by paramedics or specialist doctors. The proposed tool first segments the bone region of an input digital X-ray image from its surrounding flesh region and then generates the bone-contour using an adaptive thresholding approach. Next, it performs unsupervised correction of bone-contour discontinuities that might have been generated because of segmentation errors, and finally detects the presence of fracture in the bone. Moreover, the method can also localize the line-of-break for easy visualization of the fracture, identify its orientation, and assess the extent of damage in the bone. Several concepts from digital geometry such as relaxed straightness and concavity index are utilized to correct contour imperfections, and to detect fracture locations and type. Experiments on a database of several long-bone digital X-ray images show satisfactory results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Automated X-ray analysis is an integral part of telemedicine that is widely used in the rural areas where there is an acute shortage of medical practitioners. An analysis of an orthopaedic X-ray image can help the paramedical staff in remote areas to identify the severity of the condition and take proper action in a timely fashion. X-ray analysis can be done in two different phases: (i) segmentation of bone region from the surrounding flesh component followed by the extraction of bone-contour, and (ii) identification of the presence of fracture in the bone X-ray, if any.Long-bone fracture is a very common ailment among senior citizens. They often suffer from bone injury because of osteoporosis, stress, or accidental fall. Automated fracture detection can assist doctors and paramedical staff to analyze the severity of the situation and to choose a proper course of action on urgent basis. Moreover, several computer-based training (CBT) programs in medical science focus on specialized fields like orthopaedics [22]. Also, simulators based on virtual reality [8,9,29] are now becoming increasingly popular among the medical residents and interns for the purpose of self-tutoring. A tool for automated fracture detection will be very useful in orthopaedic diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients as well.The nature of bone fracture in different types of bone in human body widely differs from each other. Thus, designing a generalized algorithm for fracture identification in all types of bone is impracticable. In this paper, we have focused on the identification of fractures in a long-bone and proposed a new tool based on digital geometry [1,4]. The segmentation of a bone region of a digital X-ray image from its flesh part and generation of exact bone-contour play a crucial role in fracture detection. The proposed tool integrates an entropy-based segmentation method [3] with an adaptive thresholding-based contour tracing [2] to generate the bone-contour of an X-ray image. The algorithm traverses the bone-contour and rectifies the false discontinuities using certain new geometric techniques. This corrected bone-contour is then used for the detection of fracture locations using the concept of concavity index of a digital curve, and relaxed digital straight line segment (RDSS). When run on a large number of test cases, our tool is observed to have identified various types of fractures, successfully, in long-bone X-ray images.
