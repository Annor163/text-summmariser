@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Anaglyph video (i.e., 3D video) is a recent trend in movies and multimedia; the method has also been recently developed for conversion of such videos from traditional 2D screens or by rendering stereoscopic media into 3D video. There have also been many studies regarding movie playing and other types of entertainment that uses olfactory displays or smell generators. These devices are capable of generating a considerable number of different odors with different intensities yet still have some limitations and are not ready for commercial use. In this study, a complete solution is presented for a user to experience olfactory sensations with a displayed video on a PC with auditory and 3D visual effects using a novel olfactory display device based on a micro-porous piezoelectric film that is capable of digitally producing fine particles of scent material with precision, quantity and speed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many studies have investigated olfactory displays but have focused on building the display itself and the associated implications and challenges that might arise; others have introduced a novel approaches of smell generation and delivery using a piezoelectric transducer film with a fine mesh to generate a droplet that can be controlled digitally, providing a discrete (i.e., digital) amount of smell. This allowed the smell to travel from the container holding the smell to the nose of the user in a minimum time on the order of a second or less.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In conclusion, after implementing the proposed olfactory display, it was clear that using piezoelectric micro-porous film produce good response times and intensity control of the amount and state of the ejected scent material; these three factors are particularly important in olfactory displays, satisfying the claims described in Section 2. Additionally, the low voltage system resulted in a device that does not require external power; an internal Li-ion battery was used as a backup for the system, which is required in rare cases of the proposed olfactory display operation.The scent bitmap in the proposed design provided a robust system for embedding data and was shown to be relatively immune to disturbances and data corruption. The qualification strip was found to be somewhat mandatory because a successful qualification threshold depended on such additional information; otherwise, the extracted data were quantified successfully but could not be mapped accurately due to the absence of guiding data from the qualification stripe.In addition, the embedding process provided a high capacity, immunity and efficiency in the embedding technique and was able to hold much more data than was required for the proposed system; this allows for possible future expansion of the technique for additional scent elements.Utilizing the blue channel of the anaglyph video was shown to provide an effective data embedding method to avoid affecting the anaglyph video because the impurities of blue colors are difficult to perceive when using HVS.In the implementation, a large common chamber that all scent elements share is important for mixing scented material before ejection to be sensed by the human olfactory system as a mixture rather than a number of varying odors in time. The system implementation provided a low level of total noise that was less than 55dB, which is hardly noticeable by HAS sitting within 0.5m from the olfactory display; this is an important feature when implementing peripheral devices.Additionally, the obtained results of NC and PSNR values showed a reasonable tradeoff between imperceptibility and robustness, showing that the proposed technique describes an effective data embedding scheme for merging anaglyph 3D videos with scent information for the proposed olfactory display.
