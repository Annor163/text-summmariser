@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, mathematical models of biofilteration of mixtures of hydrophilic (methanol) and hydrophobic (α-pinene) volatile organic compounds (VOC's) biofilters were discussed. The model proposed here is based on the mass transfer in air–biofilm interface and chemical oxidation in the air stream phase. An approximate analytical expression of concentration profiles of methanol and α-pinene in air stream and biofilm phase have been derived using the Adomian decomposition method (ADM) for all possible values of parameters. Furthermore, in this work, the numerical simulation of the problem is also reported using the Matlab program to investigate the dynamics of the system. Graphical results are presented and discussed quantitatively to illustrate the solution. Good agreement between the analytical and numerical data is noted.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Different cleaning technologies of gaseous effluents have been developed. Among these technologies, biological methods are increasingly applied for the treatment of air polluted by a wide variety of pollutants. Biofilteration is certainly the most commonly used biological gas treatment technology. Biofilteration involves naturally occurring microorganisms immobilized in the form of biofilm on a porous medium such as peat, soil, compost, synthetic substances or their combination.The medium provides to the microorganisms a hospitable environment in terms of oxygen, temperature, moisture, nutrients and pH. As the polluted airstream passes through the filter-bed, pollutants are transferred from the vapor phase to the biofilm developing on the packing particles [1,2].Recently Li et al. [3] as well as other research groups [4–10] have investigated emissions of VOCs into the atmosphere. Currently, biological control processes have become an established technology for air pollution control. Biological control processes have many advantages over traditional methods such as lower operating fees and less secondary pollution, which is rather true for the removal of readily biodegradable VOCs at low concentrations, so these processes are investigated largely and widely. Bioreactors for VOC removal can be classified as biofilters, bio scrubbers, biotrickling filters, or rotating drum biofilters, and choice of reactors should be based on many factors including the characteristics of the target VOCs [11–15].In order to control the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC) like methanol, α-pinene, etc. from industries, biofilters are being used nowadays instead of chemical complex absorption method [16–20]. Biofilters offer two major advantages to an energy-starved country like India. A mathematical model is describing the dynamic physical and biological processes occurring in a packed trickle-bed air biofilters to analyze the relationship between biofilter performance and biomass accumulation in the reactor [4].For the treatment of mixed VOCs [21–23], the presence of methanol and α-pinene in the air stream significantly influenced the removal of pollutants. The removal capacity for methanol and α-pinene per unit volume of the bed decreased linearly with increasing loading rates of methanol and α-pinene. The presence of this easily biodegradable compound suppressed the growth of the methanol and α-pinene degrading microbial community, thereby decreasing methanol and α-pinene removal capacity of the biofilters. Some researchers have studied the biofitration of pure methanol [24–26] and pure α-pinene [27,28].Recently, few researchers have studied the biofitration of mixtures of pure methanol and pure α-pinene. Also a few researchers have tried to examine the treatment of mixtures of hydrophobic and hydrophilic VOCs and to understand the interactions between these compounds despite the fact that this situation exists in larger amount of air emissions. Mohseni and Allen [16] developed a mathematical model for methanol and α-pinene removal in VOC's biofilteration. Lim et al. [29] developed the steady state solution of biofilter model only for the limiting cases (first order and zero order kinetics). Also Lim et al. [30,31] obtained the non-steady solution of biofilter model using numerical methods. Recently some authors [32,33] solved the non-linear problems using fractional reduced differential transform method (FRDTM). To the best of our knowledge, to date, a rigorous analytical expression of concentrations of substrate in the biofilm phase and air phase has been reported. The purpose of this communication is to derive approximate analytical expressions for the concentrations in both the phases using the Adomian decomposition method [34–40].The mathematical model relating the biofiltration of blends of hydrophilic and hydrophobic VOCs is based on the biophysical model proposed by Mohseni and Allen [16]. It includes two main processes of diffusion of the compounds methanol and α-pinene through the biofilm and their degradation in the biofilm. Fig. 1illustrates a schematic diagram of a single particle, in the biofilter, covered with a uniform layer of biofilm in which the simultaneous biodegradation of methanol and α-pinene takes place. The experimental setup for the biofilteration of this organic compound is given in Fig. 2.The removal of methanol and α-pinene in the biofilm at steady state is described by the following system of non-linear differential equations (Mohseni and Allen [16]):(1)Demd2Smdx2=XYmμmax(m)SmKm+Sm(2)Depd2Spdx2=αXYpμmax(p)SpKp+Spwhere Smand Sprepresent the concentration of methanol and α-pinene respectively.μmax​,K,Y,Deandxare maximum specific growth rate, half saturation constant, yield coefficient, effective diffusion coefficient and the distance respectively. Subscripts m and p represent methanol and α-pinene respectively. The dry cell density in the biofilm X represents the overall population of microorganisms that consist of methanol and α-pinene degraders. The coefficient for the effect of methanol on α-pinene biodegradation is defined as follows:(3)α=1/(1+(Cm/Ki))2where Kiand Cmare the inhibition constant and the concentration of methanol in the air phase respectively. The boundary conditions are(4)Sm=Cmmm=SimandSP=CPmP=SiPatx=0(5)dSmdx=dSPdx=0atx=δThe concentrations of methanol and α-pinene in the air, along the biofilter column, are described by(6)UgdCmdh=AsDem[dSmdx]x=0(7)UgdCpdh=AsDep[dSmpdx]x=0where Cm and Cprepresent the concentration of methanol and α- pinene in the air phase.Ug​,As​,Dem​,Depandhare the superficial gas velocity, biofilm surface area, effective diffusivity of methanol, effective diffusivity of α-pinene and position along the height of the biofilters respectively. The corresponding initial conditions are(8)Cm=CmiandCp=Cpiath=0where the subscript i represents the concentration of the VOCs at the biofilters inlet.The non-linear differential Eqs. (1) and (2) are made dimensionless by defining the following dimensionless parameters:(9)β=SimKm,φ1=Xμmax(m)Ymδ2DemKm,Sm​*=SmSim(10)β1=SipKp,φ1=Xμmax(p)Ypδ2DepKp,Sp​*=SpSipUsing the above dimensionless variables, Eqs.

(11) and (12) can be expressed as(13)Sm​*=1,Sp​*=1atX*=0(14)dSm​*dX*=dSp​*dX*=0atX*=1The differential Eqs. (6) and (7) are made dimensionless by defining the following parameters:(15)A=HAsDemSimUgδCmi,A1=HAsDepSipUgδCpi,h*=hH,Cm*=CmCmi,Cp*=CpCpmiUsing Eq. (15), Eqs. (6) and (7) can be expressed in the dimensionless form as follows:(16)dCm*dh*=−A(dSm*dX*)X*=0(17)dCmp*dh*=−αA1(dSp*dX*)X*=0The corresponding initial conditions for the above Eqs. (16) and (17) can be expressed as(18)Cm*=CmCmiandCp*=CmpCpiath*=0In recent years, many authors have applied the ADM [35–40] to various problems and demonstrated the efficiency of the ADM for handling non-linear and solving various chemistry and engineering problems. Using ADM (refer to Appendix A), we can obtain the concentration of methanol and α-pinene in the biofilm phase (see Appendix B) as follows:(19)Sm*(X*)=Sm(x)Sim=1+Xμmax(m)δ2YmDem(Km+Sim)(x22δ2−xδ)=1+φ(1+β)(X*22−X*)(20)Sp*(X*)=Sp(x)Sip=1+Xμmax(p)αδ2YpDep(Kp+Sip)(x22δ2−xδ)=1+αφ1(1+β1)(X*22−X*)Also solving Eqs. (6–7) and (16–17) using the analytical method, we can obtain the concentration of methanol and α-pinene in the air phase.(21)Cm*(h*)=Cm(h)Cmi=1−AsXμmax(m)δYmUgKm(1+(Sim/Km))h=1−Aφ(1+β)h*(22)Cp*(h*)=Cp(h)Cpi=1−αAsXμmax(p)δYpUgKp(1+(Sip/Kp))h=1−αA1φ1(1+β1)h*Now we consider the limiting case where the substrate concentrations of methanol and α-pinene in biofilm phase are relatively low.

To show the efficiency of the present method, our analytical results are compared with numerical results graphically. The analytical solution of the concentrations of methanol and α-pinene in air phase and biofilm phase are compared with simulation results in Figs. 3–6. Upon comparison, it gives a satisfactory agreement for all values of the dimensionless parametersSm​*​,Sp​*​,Cm*andCp*. The detailed Matlab program for numerical simulation is provided in Appendices C and D.
