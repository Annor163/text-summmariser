Voice data mining for laryngeal pathology assessment

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We examined pathological changes in the speech signal of vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/.Various methods of voice signal analysis were examined to detect voice pathologies.Selected features have the influence on detection accuracies of pathological voice.100% voice pathology detection is achievable using Random Forest algorithm.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of different methods of speech signal analysis in the detection of voice pathologies. Firstly, an initial vector was created consisting of 28 parameters extracted from time, frequency and cepstral domain describing the human voice signal based on the analysis of sustained vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/ all at high, low and normal pitch. Afterwards we used a linear feature extraction technique (principal component analysis), which enabled a reduction in the number of parameters and choose the most effective acoustic features describing the speech signal. We have also performed non-linear data transformation which was calculated using kernel principal components. The results of the presented methods for normal and pathological cases will be revealed and discussed in this paper. The initial and extracted feature vectors were classified using the k-means clustering and the random forest classifier. We found that reasonably good classification accuracies could be achieved by selecting appropriate features. We obtained accuracies of up to 100% for classification of healthy versus pathology voice using random forest classification for female and male recordings. These results may assist in the feature development of automated detection systems for diagnosis of patients with symptoms of pathological voice.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Voice and speech play an important and influential role in many professions requiring irreproachable pronunciation. It is also the easiest means of interpersonal communication. It is said that 87.5% of inhabitants in urban areas require vocal communication for their daily work [1]. Speech disorders may lead to unintelligible communication and misunderstandings. A patient׳s voice is an important source of information which is obtained non-invasively and is used for monitoring the status of the larynx. Acoustic analysis provides a physical description of the waveforms generated and emitted by the voice organ and correlates well with the phoniatric state for proper and pathological voice emission. Further audio signal processing fosters the development of increasing measurable characteristics of human voices and allows highly accurate, objective evaluation of voice and speech disorders. The patient׳s voice quality can be assessed using sustained vowel phonations and/or conversional speech. Sustained vowels are particularly useful because they circumvent linguistic artifacts and are considered sufficient for many voice assessment applications [2].For the purpose of this paper we created a vector containing 28 parameters describing 900 female and 510 male voice recordings of sustained vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/. Half of those patients constituted a group with pathological voice symptoms and half represented healthy patients. With the use of principal component analysis we extracted the most informative principal components from the initial 28 feature vector having 90% variance. Using initial and extracted feature vectors we used the k-means clustering and random forest classification and validated this with 10-fold cross-validation. The general view on all the steps taken in this research is shown in Fig. 1. In this paper, we focus on developing an efficient method for automatic voice pathology detection. We used 3 vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/ from Saarbruecken Voice Database in our experiments and extracted a set of features that were used to automatically detect the voice impairments. We implemented several classification techniques including a RF classifier which performed best and yielded 100% accuracy for /a/ characterized by kernel principal component analysis. There is no significant difference between the pathology detection accuracies of analyzed vowels using RF classifier. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we introduce the background in Section 1 and related work in Section 2, then we go into the description of the voice database taken into the examination (Section 3), how the feature set describing the signal was constituted (Section 4), afterwards we present the classification methods (Section 5). The experiments are described in Section 6, while the discussion and conclusion of the gathered results can be found in Section 7.
