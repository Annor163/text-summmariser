@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper reports on qualitative insights generated from 46 semi-structured interviews with adults ranging in age from 18 to 70. It focuses on an online social behaviour, ‘fraping’, which involves the unauthorised alteration of content on a person’s social networking site (SNS) profile by a third party. Our exploratory research elucidates what constitutes a frape, who is involved in it, and what the social norms surrounding the activity are. We provide insights into how frape contributes to online sociality and the co-construction of online identity, and identify opportunities for further work in understanding the interplay between online social identities, social groups and social norms.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we consider fraping, an activity that involves the unauthorised alteration of information on an individual’s (the victim’s) online social network site (SNS) profile by a third party (the “frapist”). This alteration of information happens in an offline context, when the victim leaves their phone or computer unlocked and the frapist uses the device to make changes to the victim’s profile without their knowledge. It can be understood as a performative social activity within a technologically mediated society, involving the presentation of selected facets of an individual’s identity for a chosen audience.Our analysis of fraping emerged out of an exploratory, qualitative program of research, Charting the Digital Lifespan, which examined how participants live out their lives in online contexts. Data from interviews with participants ranging in age from eighteen to seventy gave us insights into what fraping is, who is involved in it, the implicit social norms that govern fraping, and the sanctions that are applied when these norms are violated. We situate these findings in the context of existing research in social identity, online representations of self and social norms.The paper therefore contributes a definition of fraping that is grounded in our qualitative data, plus insights into social norms and the role that fraping plays in online sociality and the co-construction of online identity.
