@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, financial performance of Taiwan container shipping companies are evaluated by fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM). In the evaluating problem, we first apply grey relation analysis to partition financial ratios into several clusters and find representative indices from the clusters. Then the representative indices are considered as evaluation criteria on financial performance assessment of Taiwan container shipping companies, and an FMCDM method called fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) is utilized to evaluate financial performance. By fuzzy TOPSIS, financial performances of container shipping companies are ranked, and thus a container shipping company can realize its finance competitive strength and weakness between container shipping companies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Financial performance is critical in shipping companies, especially for container shipping ones, because they need large capitals to operation. In Taiwan, the main container shipping companies are respectively Evergreen, Yang-Ming and Wan-Hai. The three container shipping companies have to own some containerships and additional equipments for cargo transportation, whereas the machines and tools take them giant capitals. Based on the idea, a container shipping company should evaluate the financial performance which directly influences the survival of the company. To evaluate financial performance of container shipping companies, evaluation criteria are grasped from financial ratios [34]. The financial ratios are usually from balance sheet, income statement and cash flow. However, some of financial ratios are similar on identified patterns. To avoid evaluating similar financial ratios repeatedly, financial ratios will be partitioned into several clusters, and a representative index is selected from a cluster to be as an evaluation criterion [7–11,13,17,19,20,28,31]. Then an proper method will be applied to evaluate the financial performance of container shipping companies.In Taiwan, there are three major container shipping companies for stock market. Data is little and distribution is unknown on finance for the three companies, so the classical clustering methods are not adequate. To match scarce data and unknown distribution, we utilize grey relation analysis [6] to cluster financial ratios and then find representative indices to be evaluation criteria. The financial performance evaluation problem with some criteria belongs to multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) ones [15,18]. Additionally, financial performances of container shipping companies are evaluated in recent five periods. These ratios in the five periods are aggregated into fuzzy numbers for reserving messages, and thus the evaluation problem will be a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) one [1–3,14,16,21–27,29,30,32,33]. A FMCDM method called fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) [35] is used to evaluate the financial performance of Taiwan container shipping companies. By fuzzy TOPSIS, the evaluation problem of financial performance of Taiwan container shipping companies is easily solved.For the sake of clarity, representative indices found by grey relation analysis are presented in Section 2. Notions of fuzzy sets and fuzzy numbers are displayed in Section 3. The FMCDM method is presented in Section 4. Finally, an empirical example of three container shipping companies in Taiwan is illustrated in Section 5.In accounting aspect, financial ratios are usually classified into some categories [11,34] because accounting experts suppose that financial ratios within a cluster are partially similar. Likewise, the financial ratios of container shipping companies are originally divided into following categories shown in Table 1.In addition to fixed assets to stockholder's equity ratio, debt to total assets ratio and accounts payable turnover belong to cost criteria, the other ratios are benefit criteria for above table.Based on entries of Table 1, we apply grey relation analysis to partition financial ratios into several clusters and then find representative indices being criteria form clusters to evaluate financial performances of container shipping companies. Grey relation analysis is from grey system theory introduced by Deng [6]. Greyness fundamental definition is the information being incomplete or unknown, and thus an element from an incomplete message is considered as grey elements. Grey relation analysis is a method to measure relation between grey elements, and definitions of clustering financial ratios are stated below.Assume that m companies financial performances with t periods are evaluated based on s financial ratios. Letxi={xi(k)|k=1,2,…,mt}∈Xdenote sequences of financial ratio i constructed on m companies in t periods fori=1,2,…,s. X is a set composed of all financial ratios. For being consistent and monotonically increasing [36–38], financial ratios are normalized in two different situations.As xi(k) belongs to benefit items,(1)yi(k)=xi(k)∑q=1mt[xi(q)]2;otherwise xi(k) belongs cost items,(2)yi(k)=1/xi(k)∑q=1mt[1/xi(q)]2,where yi(k) is normalized value of financial ratio i on item k,k=1,2,…,mt;i=1,2,…,s.Letyi={yi(k)|k=1,2,…,mt}∈Ydenote sequences of normalized financial ratio i on m companies with t periods, wherei=1,2,…,s. Y being a factor set of grey relation is a set consisting of all normalized financial ratios. Let y0∈Y represent referential sequence, and yi∈Y represent comparative sequence. y0 (k) and yi(k) indicate the financial ratio values of y0 and yion item k respectively. Then average relation value r(y0, yi) [6,11] of a set{r(y0(k),yi(k))|k=1,2,…,m}is a real number and defined by grey relation in the following. Let(3)r(y0,yi)=1mt∑k=1mtr(y0(k),yi(k))=r0i,wherer(y0(k),yi(k))=minyi(≠y0)∈Ymink|y0(k)−yi(k)|+ζmaxyi(≠y0)∈Ymaxk|y0(k)−yi(k)||y0(k)−yi(k)|+ζmaxyi(≠y0)∈Ymaxk|y0(k)−yi(k)|and ζ∈[0,1] is a distinguished coefficient.By grey relation analysis, we obtain a grey relation matrix R=(rij), wherei=1,2,…,s,j=1,2,…,s. Definition of clustering financial ratios through entries of the grey relation matrix is displayed below.Definition 2.1If rij≥r and rji≥r then Yiand Yjare within a cluster, where r is a threshold value of clustering.rij≥r, rji≥r, rik≥r, rki≥r, but rjk<r or rkj<r. In case min{rij,rji}≥min{rik,rki}, Yiand Yjare clustered into a cluster.After partitioning financial ratios into several clusters through above definitions, finding of representative indices from clusters is presented in following definitions.Definition 2.3As Yiand Yjbelong to a cluster, representative index of the cluster is found according to the maximum value of rijand rji. If rij≥rji, representative index of the cluster is financial ratio i.As Yi, Yjand Ykare within a cluster, representative index of the cluster is found according to the maximum value of rij+rik, rji+rjkand rki+rkj. In case rij+rikis the maximum value, the representative index of the cluster is financial ratio i.Sometimes, there are four or more financial ratios in a cluster. Thus Definition 2.5 is proposed for this situation.Definition 2.5T is a set composed of four or more financial ratios, and Yibelongs to a cluster T. Representative index of the cluster is financial ratio i if∑j(≠i)∈Trij>∑j(≠k)∈Trkj, for all k∈T, and k≠i.In this section, we review some basic notions of fuzzy sets and fuzzy numbers [39–41] expressed in the following:Definition 3.1Let U be a universe set. A fuzzy set A of U is defined by a membership functionμA(x)→[0,1], whereμA(x),∀x∈U, indicates the degree of x in A.A fuzzy set A of universe set U is normal iffsupx∈UμA(x)=1.A fuzzy set A of universe set U is convex iffμA(λx+(1−λ)y)≥(μA(x)∧μA(y)),∀x,y∈U,∀λ∈[0,1], where ∧ denotes the minimum operator.A fuzzy set A is a fuzzy number iff A is normal and convex of U.A triangular fuzzy number A shown in Fig. 1is a fuzzy number with piecewise linear membership function μAdefined byLet A=(a1, a2, a3) and B=(b1, b2, b3) be two triangular fuzzy numbers. A distance measure function [3] of A and B is defined as:Let≻̲̲be a binary relation [35,36] on triangular fuzzy numbers, and A=(a1, a2, a3) and B=(b1, b2, b3) be two triangular fuzzy numbers.A≻̲̲Biff a1≥b1, a2≥b2, a3≥b3.≻̲̲is a partial ordering relation on triangular fuzzy numbers.A and B are two triangular fuzzy numbers, where A=(a1, a2, a3) and B=(b1, b2, b3). Addition ⊕ of A and B based on extension principle [39–41] is defined as:If A=(a1, a2, a3), multiplication ⊗ of A and a real number r through extension principle [39–41] is defined as:Let MIN and MAX be two operators for a set of triangular fuzzy numbers{X1,X2,…,Xn}, whereXj=(x1j,x2j,x3j)forj=1,2,…,n. DefineXt≻̲̲MIN1≤j≤n{Xj}andMAX1≤j≤n{Xj}≻̲̲Xtfort=1,2,…,n.Based on above operators MAX and MIN, we extend technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) [15] into fuzzy TOPSIS for evaluation of financial performance in the following.Fuzzy TOPSIS [27,28,35,36] is generalization of TOPSIS on fuzzy environment. TOPSIS proposed by Hwang and Yoon [15] in 1981 was a well-known MCDM method. The underlying logic of TOPSIS is to define ideal and anti-ideal solutions. Ideal solution is a solution that maximizes benefit criteria and minimizes cost criteria. On the other hand, anti-ideal solution is a solution that maximizes cost criteria and minimizes benefit criteria. An optimal alternative is the one which is closest to ideal solution and farthest to anti-ideal solution. In short, ideal solution consists of all best values attainable of criteria, whereas anti-ideal solution is composed of all worst values attainable of criteria.Generally, performance ratings and criteria weights are crisp values in MCDM. For FMCDM [4], ratings and weights are fuzzy numbers on uncertain environment. To solve FMCDM problems by TOPSIS, ratings and weights through defuzzification might be transferred into crisp values or TOPSIS was extended into fuzzy TOPSIS. Defuzzification often lost some messages, and thus TOPSIS should be generalized under fuzzy environment into fuzzy TOPSIS [35]. In fuzzy TOPSTS, most of the steps of TOPSIS can be easily generalized to fuzzy environment except max and min operations in finding ideal and anti-ideal solutions. Through fuzzy TOPSIS [35], we utilize two operators MAX and MIN which are fuzzy generalization of max and min. To evaluate financial performance of container shipping companies, evaluation ratings are presented by a giving period values and criteria weights are expressed through linguistic terms. The two are converted into fuzzy numbers. To describe FMCDM clearly, we display the procedure below.First, we formulate comparative evaluation of financial performance as a FMCDM problem. The FMCDM problem involves a set of m container shipping companies, which are evaluated on n representative indices to be evaluation criteria and related weights. The problem is modeled as:(10)C1C2…CnG=[Gij]m×n=A1A2⋮AmG11G12⋯G1nG21G22⋯G2n⋮⋮⋯⋮Gm1Gm2⋯Gmnand(11)W=[W1,W2,…,Wn],whereA1,A2,…,Amare m container shipping companies,C1,C2,…,Cnare n evaluation criteria, Gijis financial performance rating of company Aiagainst evaluation criteria Cj, and Wjis weight of Cj.In the evaluating process, weights represent important degrees of criteria displayed by linguistic terms [5,12] through finance experts on subjective assessments. The linguistic weights are very low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H) and very high (VH). Above linguistic terms are converted into triangular fuzzy numbers, and fuzzy terms can be limited in a given interval [0,1]. Thus these fuzzy numbers expressing weights will not be normalized as done in TOPSIS. Additionally, financial performance ratings are easily derived as representative indices are determined. The deriving formula of financial performance ratings is presented below. Let bij(e) indicate normalized value of representative index (i.e. criteria) j for alternative i on period e and Gijbe financial performance rating for alternative i on criteria j, wherei=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n;e=1,2,…,t.Define(12)Gij=(g1ij,g2ij,g3ij),whereg1ij=min1≤e≤t{bij(e)},g2ij=1t∑e=1tbij(e)andg3ij=max1≤e≤t{bij(e)}.Then,[Gi1,Gi2,…,Gin]denotes performance matrix of alternative Aion all criteria, wherei=1,2,…,m.By MIN and MAX operations, anti-ideal solution A− and ideal solution A+ of the m alternatives are obtained. Let(13)A−=[G1−,G2−,…,Gn−]and(14)A+=[G1+,G2+,…,Gn+],whereGj−=MIN1≤i≤m{Gij}=(g1j−,g2j−,g3j−)andGj+=MAX1≤i≤m{Gij}=(g1j+,g2j+,g3j+)forj=1,2,…,n.By Lemma 3.2,Gj+≻̲̲Gij≻̲̲Gj−, wherei=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n.Assumedij−anddij+to be distance values from GijtoGj−andGj+,where(15)dij−=d(Gij,Gj−)=13[(g1ij−g1j−)2+(g2ij−g2j−)2+(g3ij−g3j−)2]and(16)dij+=d(Gij,Gj+)=13[(g1ij−g1j+)2+(g2ij−g2j+)2+(g3ij−g3j+)2]fori=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n.Let Wjkindicate linguistic weight evaluated by expert Ekon criterion Cj, and then converted into fuzzy number(w1jk,w2jk,w3jk), wherej=1,2,…,n;k=1,2,…,p. Assume that Wjis weight of criterion Cj. We define(17)Wj=(w1j,w2j,w3j)=1p⊗(Wj1⊕Wj2⊕Wj3⊕⋯⊕Wjp),wherew1j=∑k=1pw1jkp,w2j=∑k=1pw2jkp,w3j=∑k=1pw3jkpandj=1,2,…,n.LetDi−andDi+express weighted distance values from alternative Aito anti-ideal solution A– and ideal solution A+. Define(18)Di−=W1⊗di1−⊕W2⊗di2−⊕⋯⊕Wn⊗din−and(19)Di+=W1⊗di1+⊕W2⊗di2+⊕⋯⊕Wn⊗din+,wherei=1,2,…,m.Above distance values from alternative Aito anti-ideal and ideal solutions can be aggregated into distance vector[Di−,Di+], wherei=1,2,…,m.Let(20)ND−=MIN1≤i≤m{Di−},(21)ND+=MAX1≤i≤m{Di−},(22)PD−=MIN1≤i≤m{Di+}and(23)PD+=MAX1≤i≤m{Di+}.We define that anti-ideal solution and ideal solution of[Di−,Di+]are respectively[ND−,PD+]and[ND+,PD−]fori=1,2,…,m. LetAi−andAi+denote distance values from[Di−,Di+]to[ND−,PD+]and[ND+,PD−]. Thus(24)Ai−=d(Di−,ND−)+d(Di+,PD+)and(25)Ai+=d(Di−,ND+)+d(Di+,PD−),fori=1,2,…,m.Finally, closeness coefficientAi*of alternative Aiis defined as:(26)Ai*=Ai−Ai−+Ai+,fori=1,2,…,m.Obviously,0≤Ai*≤1,wherei=1,2,…,m. AsAi*=1, alternative Aiis ideal solution. Oppositely,Ai*=0denotes that Aiis anti-ideal solution. An alternative Aiis closer to ideal solution and farther from anti-ideal solution asAi*approaches to 1. Therefore, we rank alternatives according to alternatives closeness coefficients and then the best alternative is determined.Through above procedure of FMCDM, we realize that fuzzy TOPSIS is generalization of TOPSIS on fuzzy environment. Practically, fuzzy TOPSIS can be applied in certain environment as well. For instance,(27)Gij=(g1ij,g2ij,g3ij)=(gij,gij,gij)=gij,(28)Gj−=(g1j−,g2j−,g3j−)=(gj−,gj−,gj−)=gj−,(29)Gj+=(g1j+,g2j+,g3j+)=(gj+,gj+,gj+)=gj+,and(30)Wj=(w1j,w2j,w3j)=(wj,wj,wj)=wj,wherei=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n.By Eqs. (15), (16), (27), (28) and (29),(31)dij−=d(Gij,Gj−)=13[(gij−gj−)2+(gij−gj−)2+(gij−gj−)2]=|gij−gj−|.and(32)dij+=d(Gij,Gj+)=13[(gij−gj+)2+(gij−gj+)2+(gij−gj+)2]=|gij−gj+|.Through Eqs. (18), (19), (30), (31) and (32),(33)Di−=W1⊗di1−⊗W2⊗di2−⊕⋯⊕Wn⊗din−=∑j=1nwj⋅|gij−gj−|=∑j=1n|wjgij−wjgj−|and(34)Di+=W1⊗di1+⊕W2⊗di2+⊕⋯⊕Wn⊗din+=∑j=1nwj⋅|gij−gj+|=∑j=1n|wjgij−wjgj+|wherei=1,2,…,m.Above distance equations are as the same as TOPSIS operation in certain environment.Obviously, fuzzy TOPSIS is a wider application than TOPSIS because the former is used in certain and uncertain environments. This is strength of fuzzy TOPSIS versus TOPSIS.To present evaluation work of financial performance, we illustrate an empirical example concerning three Taiwan container shipping companies in five given periods. Through data coming from [37,38], financial ratios of the five periods for three companies A1, A2 and A3 are shown in Table 2.By Eqs. (1) and (2), financial ratios in Table 2 are normalized. After normalizing entries of Table 2, grey relation matrices with ζ=0.5 in four various categories are constructed. The matrices indicated as R1, R2, R3, R4 are derived by Eq. (3) as descriptions of [37,38]. ThusR1=10.6330.8310.5920.6130.6420.65010.7230.4550.5480.6320.8500.78610.6930.7210.7340.6140.4590.58110.6700.6120.5860.5020.5830.61910.7060.6420.6150.6500.5910.7281,R2=10.9890.5370.6860.8250.98510.5340.6840.8160.5530.55310.6470.5040.7460.7670.75210.7720.8350.8300.4910.6751,R3=10.5800.7330.7400.7380.59410.4800.6680.6570.8170.63610.7570.7690.6700.5740.54410.8130.6570.5540.5720.8101,andR4=10.7460.7670.7520.7720.79410.7110.6890.7160.7510.66810.8880.7070.8040.6890.95910.7150.7570.6370.6520.6281.By grey relation analysis, we partition companies financial ratios into some clusters based on four categories versus a threshold value r=0.75, and a classification result is shown in Table 3. Then the representative indices are found in this table as evaluation criteria to evaluate financial performance of Taiwan container shipping companies.Based on entries of Table 3, important degrees of the fifteen criteria are assessed by four financial experts E1, E2, E3, E4 with linguistic terms VL, L, M, H, VH, and shown in Table 4.The linguistic term set {VL, L, M, H, VH} are employed to present five states of weights converted into triangular fuzzy numbers, where VL=(0,0,0.3), L=(0,0.3,0.5), M=(0.3,0.5,0.7), H=(0.5,0.7,1) and VH=(0.7,1,1). Thus criteria weights through Eq. (17) are derived as:W1=(0.6,0.85,1),W2=(0.5,0.725,0.925),W3=(0.5,0.725,0.925),W4=(0.4,0.625,0.775),W5=(0.4,0.6,0.85),W6=(0.5,0.725,0.925),W7=(0.4,0.6,0.85),W8=(0.4,0.6,0.85),W9=(0.275,0.5,0.725),W10=(0.4,0.6,0.85),W11=(0.5,0.7,1),W12=(0.4,0.6,0.85),W13=(0.5,0.725,0.925),W14=(0.6,0.85,1)andW15=(0.6,0.85,1).Since a representative index for a container shipping company has related values in five periods, the five values of representative index are converted into a triangular fuzzy number. The converting method is presented below. Let bij(e) indicate normalized value of index j for container shipping company i in period e, where i=1, 2, 3, j=1, 2, …, 15 and e=1, 2, …, 5. Through Eq. (10), a representative index of company i on criterion j is presented by triangular fuzzy number (g1ij, g2ij, g3ij), whereg1ij=min1≤e≤5{bij(e)},g2ij=15∑e=15bij(e)andg3ij=max1≤e≤5{bij(e)}.Based on computation of Eq. (10) and normalizing entries of Table 2, fuzzy numbers of normalized representative indices are shown in Table 5.According to entries of Table 5, anti-ideal and ideal solutions of three container shipping companies on fifteen criteria are shown in Table 6.Then, distance values from three companies to anti-ideal/ideal solution on fifteen criteria are derived below. Table 7listsd(Gij,Gj−)andd(Gij,Gj+)from GijtoGj−andGj+for i=1, 2, 3;j=1,2,…,15.Through entries of Table 7 matched with related weights, weighted distance values are shown as:D1−=(0.4125,0.5909,0.7325),D2−=(1.5854,2.3397,3.0756),D3−=(1.2955,1.9115,2.4995),D1+=(1.8234,2.6907,3.5336),D2+=(0.6054,0.8770,1.1103)andD3+=(0.9256,1.3485,1.7359).ThusND−=(0.4125,0.5909,0.7325),ND+=(1.5854,2.3397,3.0756),PD−=(0.6054,0.8770,1.1103)andPD+=(1.8234,2.6907,3.5336).ThenAi−andAi+(i=1, 2, 3) are be calculated as follows:A1−=d(D1−,ND−)+d(D1+,PD+)=0+0=0,A2−=d(D2−,ND−)+d(D2+,PD+)=1.8188+1.8838=3.7026,A3−=d(D3−,ND−)+d(D3+,PD+)=1.3718+1.3951=2.7669,A1+=d(D1−,ND+)+d(D1+,PD−)=1.8188+1.8838=3.7026,A2+=d(D2−,ND+)+d(D2+,PD−)=0+0=0andA3+=d(D3−,ND+)+d(D3+,PD−)=0.4469+0.4886=0.9355.Finally, closeness coefficients representing performances of the three container shipping companies areA1*=00+3.7026=0,A2*=3.70263.7026+0=1andA3*=2.76692.7669+0.9355=0.7473.Thus ranking order of the three companies according to closeness coefficients is A2(1)>A3(0.7473)>A1(0), and the best company is A2.Further, fuzzy TOPSIS is used to calculate total performances of the three container shipping companies, and find the best company. Moreover, the method can compute preference values of various categories as well. Based on above, financial ratios are classified into four categories (i.e. financial structure, solvency, turnover and profitability) shown as Table 2. Preference values of the four categories are derived according to entries of Table 6 along various criteria, and ranking orders are respectively presented below. For the three companies, preference order in financial structure category is A3(1)>A2(0.6991)>A1(0), preference order in solvency category is A2(1)>A3(0.2803)>A1(0), preference order in turnover category is A2(1)>A3(0.8327)>A1(0), and preference order in profitability category is A2(1)>A1(0.5743)>A3(0). Figures inside parentheses refer to relative closeness coefficients as stated as total performance situation. The greater the figure is, the higher the preference is. In the four categories, closeness coefficient values of A2 are greater than others for solvency, turnover and profitability categories, expect financial structure category. Through total performance and four categories, the best financial performance company is A2. In fact, financial performances of companies can be evaluated on various perspectives including all representative indices and partial categories.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we utilize grey relation analysis to find representative indices and apply fuzzy TOPSIS to evaluate financial performance of container shipping companies. Additionally, an empirical example concerning financial performance evaluation of three container shipping companies in Taiwan is illustrated. Through the illustrated example, it is obvious that financial performance of the three container shipping companies is simply and easily evaluated. Practically, the number of major container shipping companies in Taiwan is three, but fuzzy TOPSIS solve evaluation problems with lots of feasible alternatives as well. Besides, comparing a container shipping company with others can identify its financial strength and weakness. It is useful for that the company realizes finance location between container shipping companies, and improves finance competitive in the future. Further, the FMCDM method can evaluate feasible alternatives of many fields on various perspectives as description of Section 5, so it is not merely utilized in finance aspect.
