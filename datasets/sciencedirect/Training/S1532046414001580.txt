@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Pharmacovigilance involves continually monitoring drug safety after drugs are put to market. To aid this process; algorithms for the identification of strongly correlated drug/adverse drug reaction (ADR) pairs from data sources such as adverse event reporting systems or Electronic Health Records have been developed. These methods are generally statistical in nature, and do not draw upon the large volumes of knowledge embedded in the biomedical literature. In this paper, we investigate the ability of scalable Literature Based Discovery (LBD) methods to identify side effects of pharmaceutical agents. The advantage of LBD methods is that they can provide evidence from the literature to support the plausibility of a drug/ADR association, thereby assisting human review to validate the signal, which is an essential component of pharmacovigilance. To do so, we draw upon vast repositories of knowledge that has been extracted from the biomedical literature by two Natural Language Processing tools, MetaMap and SemRep. We evaluate two LBD methods that scale comfortably to the volume of knowledge available in these repositories. Specifically, we evaluate Reflective Random Indexing (RRI), a model based on concept-level co-occurrence, and Predication-based Semantic Indexing (PSI), a model that encodes the nature of the relationship between concepts to support reasoning analogically about drug-effect relationships. An evaluation set was constructed from the Side Effect Resource 2 (SIDER2), which contains known drug/ADR relations, and models were evaluated for their ability to “rediscover” these relations. In this paper, we demonstrate that both RRI and PSI can recover known drug-adverse event associations. However, PSI performed better overall, and has the additional advantage of being able to recover the literature underlying the reasoning pathways it used to make its predictions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an “appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction, resulting from an intervention related to the use of a medical product” [1]. ADRs were reported to be between the fourth and sixth leading cause of death in the United States in 1994 [2], accounting for 3–7% of medical hospital admissions [3,4] and a substantial number of health care visits [5]. They have a considerable negative impact on health and the healthcare system, despite the fact that extensive pre-marketing clinical trials are designed to test drug safety and efficacy. For example Phase III clinical trials have been estimated to cost 86.3 million U.S. dollars and last 30.5months on average [6]. Nonetheless, rare ADRs may not be detected due to the limited duration and sample size of such trials, and others may occur on account of idiosyncratic characteristics of individuals excluded from the evaluated sample. The continued monitoring for ADRs after drugs are released into the market, called pharmacovigilance (PV), is therefore an important tool to monitor and improve drug safety.Over the last decade, drug safety data obtained from spontaneous reporting systems (SRSs) have been analyzed using quantitative data mining procedures to retrieve strongly associated drug/ADR pairs [7–9]. These highlighted associations are subsequently reviewed and scrutinized by domain experts. Unfortunately, research suggests data collected by SRS are limited by long time latency, incorrect or incomplete clinical information, underreporting and reporting bias [10,11]. Consequently, clinicians and researchers have also utilized existing healthcare data sources such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to attempt to identify previously unreported ADRs [12–15]. However, these data are inherently noisy as drugs and potential side effects may co-occur in the EHR for many reasons. In addition, the EHR often contains free-text data, and the accuracy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools is not perfect. New methods are required to selectively identify potentially hazardous drug/ADR associations. Consequently, the development of computational approaches to more accurately detect potential side effects is currently an active area of research [16–20]. These approaches have predominantly focused on improving signal detection using statistical methods, machine learning (ML) or some combination thereof.In this paper, we develop an approach that is conceptually different than, and complementary to, such efforts. Methods of literature-based discovery (LBD) are used to detect potential drug/ADR associations and to retrieve literature that supports their plausibility. The paper proceeds as follows. First we discuss the significance and challenges of pharmacovigilance, and how LBD methods might address these. We then provide relevant background on recent developments in LBD; and introduce the NLP tools that were used to extract knowledge from the literature for our experiments. We then discuss these experiments, in which we attempt to identify known ADRs using knowledge from the biomedical literature, and discuss their implications for pharmacovigilance practice.
