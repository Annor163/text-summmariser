@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A mixed finite element model has been derived for the acoustic analysis of perforated dissipative silencers including several effects simultaneously: (1) High temperature and thermal gradients in the central duct and the outer absorbent material; (2) a perforated passage carrying non-uniform axial mean flow. For such a combination, the properties of sound propagation media and flow are inhomogeneous and vary with position. The material of the outer chamber can be modelled by its complex equivalent acoustic properties, which completely determine the propagation of sound waves in the air contained in the absorbent medium. Temperature gradients introduce variations in these properties that can be evaluated through a heterogeneous temperature-dependent resistivity in combination with material models obtained at room temperature. A pressure-based wave equation for stationary medium is then used with the equivalent density and speed of sound of the absorbent material varying as functions of the spatial coordinates. Regarding the central air passage, a wave equation in terms of acoustic velocity potential can be used to model the non-uniform moving medium since the presence of temperature variations introduce not only heterogeneous acoustic properties of the air but also a gradient in the mean flow velocity. The acoustic connection between the central passage and the outer chamber is given by the acoustic impedance of the perforated duct. This impedance depends on the heterogeneous properties of the absorbent material and the non-uniform mean flow, leading to a spatial variation of the acoustic coupling and also to additional convective terms in the governing equations. The results presented show the influence of temperature, thermal gradients and mean flow on the transmission loss of automotive silencers. It has been found that high temperature and thermal-induced heterogeneity can have a significant influence on the acoustic attenuation of an automotive silencer and so should be included in theoretical models. In some particular configurations it may be relatively accurate to approximate the temperature field by using a uniform profile with an average value, specially for low resistivity materials. It has been shown, however, that this is not always possible and attenuation overestimation is likely to be predicted, mainly for high radial thermal gradients and high material flow resistivities, if the temperature distribution is not taken into account.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The presence of high temperature and heterogeneous properties in dissipative silencers modifies their acoustic attenuation performance. These spatial variations can arise, for example, from uneven filling processes [1–4], non-uniform mean flow fields [5] and thermal gradients [6,7]. In the latter case, the difficulties associated with experimental measurements at high temperatures make it necessary to find computational approaches useful to evaluate the acoustic behaviour of the silencer.Several theoretical models were developed to incorporate the influence of high temperature and thermal variations in ducts. Dong and Liu [8] presented a finite element approach for rectangular ducts including flow and temperature gradient. Prasad and Crocker [9] considered a wave equation with uniform mean flow in terms of velocity potential and obtained analytically the four-pole parameters for a straight pipe in the presence of a linear temperature gradient. Munjal and Prasad [10] noted that a temperature gradient would introduce a corresponding variation in the mean density and a gradient in the mean flow velocity and Mach number, and incorporated this influence in a plane wave propagation model for a uniform pipe. Sujith [11] presented a formulation for uniform ducts with arbitrarily large temperature gradients in the absence of flow, while Dokumaci [12] and Karthik et al. [13] extended the one-dimensional approach to include the presence of mean flow.Significant temperature variations can be found along the exhaust system of internal combustion engines [14–18]. Concerning the acoustic performance of silencers, it is straightforward to account for the effects of uniform high temperature fields if only reactive elements are present [19], since attenuation curves at different temperatures overlap when a normalized frequency f/c is considered, c being the speed of sound at working temperature T[20]. Therefore, a single computation at a known temperature allows the calculation of the acoustic attenuation performance for a wide temperature range. The previous comments cannot be applied, in general, to dissipative silencers, since the acoustic properties of the absorbent material cannot be scaled in the same way [6,7]. This indicates that the approach considered for reactive configurations cannot be used to describe sound propagation in the presence of a dissipative medium. In this case, a specific calculation is required for each temperature.For reactive configurations, a number of works can be found where the influence of temperature and the associated gradients has been modelled and analysed. Kim et al. [21] presented a multidimensional analytical approach for the acoustic modelling of expansion chambers with mean flow and a temperature gradient. A segmentation technique was applied dividing the silencer into segments with constant temperature and mean flow, and matching the acoustic fields through the corresponding continuity conditions. The approach was extended by Kim and Choi [22] to circular reversing chambers with temperature variations and a stationary medium. Wang et al. [23] combined the segmentation procedure and the boundary element method (BEM) to compute the transmission loss of expansion chambers with uniform mean flow and a linear temperature gradient. Siano [24] presented some three-dimensional BEM results for perforated silencers with different uniform temperatures. It is worth noting that, for a continuously varying temperature field, a suitable version of the wave equation is required to account for the heterogeneous properties of the propagation medium [25,26]. For reactive configurations, this wave equation provides a model for computing the sound attenuation, once the coordinate-dependent density and speed of sound have been evaluated from the ideal gas law [7,27].Few articles in the literature consider the effect of temperature on the performance of dissipative silencers. In principle, the equivalent bulk acoustic properties of fibres can be estimated by including the effect of temperature on the material resistivity [20]. This approach was experimentally validated by Christie [28], who predicted with reasonable agreement the characteristic impedance and propagation constant of mineral wool fibrous material at different temperatures from the combination of the flow resistivity measurements at those temperatures and a modified version of Delany and Bazley’s formulae [29,30]. Williams et al. [31] have recently provided further experimental validation at high temperatures for additional fibrous materials such as basalt wool and E glass. From an acoustical point of view, a suitable material model can be obtained by using the results obtained at room conditions while updating the material resistivity to the actual working temperature. Concerning dissipative silencers, Ref. [6] presented a mode matching–based multidimensional analytical approach to assess thermal effects on the acoustic performance of circular dissipative reversing chamber silencers. A significant temperature influence was found on the sound attenuation characteristics. To account for the temperature-induced heterogeneity within the absorbent material, a segmentation procedure was considered with a number of dissipative regions with different but axially uniform temperature. The regression formulas (similar to Delany and Bazley expressions) for texturized fibre glass at room conditions [32] were extended to high temperature applications by including the thermal influence on the material resistivity while keeping the rest of coefficients and exponents constant. The same procedure was applied in Ref. [7], where a numerical approach based on the finite element method (FEM) was presented to analyze the effect of a continuously varying temperature field on the transmission loss of perforated dissipative silencers. A suitable version of the wave equation was required to account for heterogeneous density and speed of sound [3,4,25,26]. In the previous approaches [6,7,31], the effect of the temperature on the acoustic properties of the absorbent material were accounted for by modifying the steady air-flow resistivity in the initial model of the material obtained at room temperature.More general problems involving the simultaneous consideration of variable temperature and mean flow effects for perforated dissipative silencers containing an absorbent material require further research. The objective of the present work is to model and analyse the sound propagation in dissipative configurations including: (1) A central perforated passage carrying a non-uniform mean flow, and (2) high temperature and thermal variations in the central duct and the outer chamber. A mixed finite element approach is developed in the current investigation that couples a convective wave equation for inhomogeneous moving medium (in terms of an acoustic velocity potential) associated with the central duct and a pressure-based wave equation for heterogeneous stationary medium corresponding to the dissipative region. The influence of a number of parameters on the acoustic attenuation performance is investigated, including the effect of temperature, axial and radial thermal gradients and mean flow Mach number.Fig. 1 shows the sketch of a dissipative silencer, which consists of a perforated central duct (subdomain Ωa) carrying a mean flow and an outer chamber (subdomain Ωm) with absorbent material. The corresponding boundary surfaces are denoted by Γaand Γm, respectively, the inlet and outlet sections are represented by Γiand Γo, and the perforated surface is Γp. The temperature field is assumed one-dimensional in the central passage, reaching its maximum value at the inlet while decreasing gradually along the flow path [14,16,17,18,21,23]. A more general multidimensional function T(x,y,z)=T(x) is considered in the chamber [17]. Temperature variations in the silencer lead to heterogeneous properties in the propagation media as well as spatial dependence of the acoustic impedanceZ˜pcorresponding to the perforated duct. Sound propagation in Ωa(air) is characterized by the axially-varying acoustic properties ρa(x) and ca(x) (density and speed of sound, respectively). The corresponding multidimensional equivalent acoustic values ρm(x) and cm(x) are used in the dissipative region Ωm. Further details on these temperature-induced heterogeneities will be provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.It is worth noting that the variation of the mean density in the central duct due to the temperature gradient introduces a corresponding variation in the mean flow velocity and Mach number [10]. As can be seen in the figure, these axial variations of the mean flow velocity Umfinduced by the thermal gradient are also considered.In a continuously varying temperature field, a suitable version of the wave equation is required to account for the heterogeneous properties of the air. For uniform mean flow and a constant density ρaand speed of sound ca, a simple and concise convective wave equation can be used in terms of the acoustic perturbation to the pressure field [33]. An equation of comparable simplicity cannot be used, however, when the medium is moving and the corresponding velocity field varies with position [25]. In this latter case, a pressure-based wave equation includes spatial derivatives of the acoustic velocity, and therefore several dependent variables are involved. The problem can be overcome if an acoustic velocity potential-based wave equation is considered, as shown in the work of Pierce [25], where a generalization of the fundamental acoustic wave equation is derived. For the central passage depicted in Fig. 1, sound propagation is then governed by(1)∇(ρa∇Φa)−ρaDt(1ca2DtΦa)=0where an inhomogeneous fluid (air) with ambient properties and flow that vary with position are considered. In Eq. (1), Фais the acoustic velocity potential so that(2)Ua={UaVaWa}T=∇Φaand Dtis the total time derivative given by [25,33](3)Dt=∂∂t+UmfT∇withUmf={UmfVmfWmf}T. The relation between the acoustic pressure and the potential is given by [25](4)Pa=−ρaDtΦaSimilarly to earlier studies [33–35], the mean flow is assumed unidirectional, with Umf≠0, Vmf=Wmf=0, and transversely uniform over the duct cross-section. Therefore, no dependence exists on the (y, z) coordinates. As indicated previously, mean flow inhomogeneity is considered, however, along the axial direction, due to the presence of a temperature gradient in the perforated central passage, thus leading to Umf=Umf(x). Therefore, the total time derivative can be written as(5)Dt=∂∂t+Umf∂∂x=jω+Umf∂∂xwhere a harmonic time dependence of the acoustic velocity potential is assumed, ω being the angular frequency and j the imaginary unit.After applying the previous definition, Eq. (1) yields(6)∇(ρa∇Φa)−ρaUmf2ca2∂2Φa∂x2−2ρajωUmfca2∂Φa∂x−ρaUmf2∂(1/ca2)∂x∂Φa∂x−ρaUmfca2∂Umf∂x∂Φa∂x−ρajωUmf∂(1/ca2)∂xΦa+ρaω2ca2Φa=0The weighted residual statement (with weighting function Ψ) and the divergence theorem [36] are applied to Eq. (6). Further manipulation yields(7)−∫Ωaρa∇TΨM∇ΦadΩ+∫ΩaΨ(Umf2ca2∂ρa∂x+ρaUmfca2∂Umf∂x−2ρajωUmfca2)∂Φa∂xdΩ+∫ΩaΨ(−ρajωUmf∂(1/ca2)∂x+ρaω2ca2)ΦadΩ+∫ΓaρaΨnTM∇ΦadΓ=0where it is worth noting that ρa, caand Umfare variable functions. In Eq. (7), n is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary Γ and M is given by(8)M=[1−Umf2ca200010001]After comparison of Eqs. (6) and (7), it is found that the product of the spatial derivatives of both the speed of sound and the acoustic velocity potential cancels during the mathematical procedure. In addition, since the ambient values satisfy the relation ρaUmfS=constant[10] and the cross-section S of the central passage is uniform, the following expression can be obtained(9)Umf∂ρa∂x+ρa∂Umf∂x=0Therefore, the first two terms of the second integral in Eq. (7) also vanish and therefore the equation can be written as(10)−∫Ωaρa∇TΨM∇ΦadΩ+∫ΩaΨ(−2ρajωUmfca2)∂Φa∂xdΩ+∫ΩaΨ(−ρajωUmf∂(1/ca2)∂x+ρaω2ca2)ΦadΩ+∫ΓaρaΨnTM∇ΦadΓ=0The finite element discretization and interpolation (with shape functions N) are used in combination with the Galerkin approach [36], leading to(11)∑e=1Nae(∫Ωaeρa(∇N)TM∇NdΩ+jω∫Ωae2ρaUmfca2NT∂N∂xdΩ+jω∫ΩaeρaUmf∂(1/ca2)∂xNTNdΩ−ω2∫Ωaeρaca2NTNdΩ)Φ˜ae=∑e=1Nae∫ΓaeρaNTnTM∇ΦadΓwhere signs have been change for convenience.Φ˜aecontains the unknown nodal potentials andNaerepresents the number of elements of subdomain Ωa(air). Eq. (11) can be written in compact form as(12)(Ka+jω(Ca1+Ca2)−ω2Ma)Φ˜a=Fawhere the following nomenclature has been introduced(13)Ka=∑e=1Nae∫Ωaeρa(∇N)TM∇NdΩ(14)Ma=∑e=1Nae∫Ωaeρaca2NTNdΩ(15)Ca1=∑e=1Nae∫Ωae2ρaUmfca2NT∂N∂xdΩ(16)Ca2=∑e=1Nae∫ΩaeρaUmf∂(1/ca2)∂xNTNdΩ(17)Fa=∑e=1Nae∫ΓaeρaNTnTM∇ΦadΓ=∑e=1Nae(∫Γae∩ΓbcρaNT(1−Umf2ca2)∂Φa∂ndΓ+∫Γae∩ΓpρaNT∂Φa∂ndΓ)Γbc=Γi∪Γobeing the surface where inlet/outlet boundary conditions are applied (see Fig. 1 for details).It is worth noting that some differences arise in the formulation compared to Ref. [4] due to the spatial variation of the air properties. For a given temperature distribution, mass conservation is considered to compute the axial variation of Umf[10,12] for a prescribed inlet mean flow Mach number Mi. The density and speed of sound ρaand cacan be easily evaluated at each integration point assuming the ideal gas law, as shown in the work of Dokumaci [12], where the local dependence of caand ρaon the mean flow velocity is not taken into account since the flow velocities under consideration are relatively low. The spatial derivative of cain Eq. (16) can be also calculated analytically and/or numerically, depending on the complexity of the temperature field. As can be inferred from the definition ofCa2, the influence of this latter matrix on the silencer transmission loss is small when compared to the contributions from the rest of finite element matrices (this is also supported by additional calculations carried out by the authors with a number of parameters and temperature gradients).In the absence of mean flow, the wave propagation in the heterogeneous absorbent material is governed by [3,4,25,26,37](18)∇(1ρm∇Pm)+ω2ρmcm2Pm=0where a pressure formulation is considered to retain similarity with earlier studies [3,4]. In Eq. (18), Pmis the acoustic pressure and ρmand cmare the equivalent density and speed of sound [29,30]. This version of the wave equation for non-uniform properties is consistent with the literature [3,4,25,26,37] and differs from the potential model of the central passage described in the previous section. For this mixed potential/pressure-based finite element approach, the coupling equations (between Ωaand Ωm) associated with the perforated duct present some differences compared to the usual finite element formulation. Further details will be given in Section 2.4.The finite element approach is applied to Eq. (18) with the resulting algebraic system being(19)∑e=1Nme(∫Ωme1ρm(∇N)T∇NdΩ−ω2∫Ωme1ρmcm2NTNdΩ)P˜me=∑e=1Nme∫Γme1ρmNT∂Pm∂ndΓwhereP˜mecontains the unknown nodal pressures andNmerepresents the number of elements of subdomain Ωm(absorbent material). In compact form Eq. (19) becomes(20)(Km−ω2Mm)P˜m=Fmwith the notation(21)Km=∑e=1Nme∫Ωme1ρm(∇N)T∇NdΩ(22)Mm=∑e=1Nme∫Ωme1ρmcm2NTNdΩ(23)Fm=∑e=1Nme∫Γme∩Γp1ρmNT∂Pm∂ndΓDetails for the computation of the equivalent density and speed of sound ρmand cmcan be found in Section 3. As in the case of the central passage, a temperature distribution will be assumed in the absorbent material.The inlet and outlet sections Γiand Γoadmit several boundary conditions in order to assess the acoustic attenuation performance of the silencer [33,38]. Velocity potential, acoustic velocity/pressure and impedance conditions can be applied. In practice, the former are directly introduced in the finite element equations, while Neumann and Robin conditions [36] are implemented taking into account the relations (2) and (4), repeated here for convenience,(24)Ua=∇Φa(25)Ua=∂Φa∂x(26)Pa=−ρaDtΦa=−ρa(∂Φa∂t+Umf∂Φa∂x)=−ρa(jωΦa+UmfUa)The normal derivative of the potential along Γbcin the load vector Faof Eq. (17) can be replaced by(27)∂Φa∂n=U˜aAcousticvelocitycondition(28)∂Φa∂n=−P˜aρaUmf−jωΦaUmfAcousticpressurecondition(29)∂Φa∂n=−ρajωΦaZ+aρaUmfAnechoictermination(planewave)where the tilde inP˜aandU˜adenotes a prescribed value and Za=ρaca.The coupling between the central duct and the chamber is carried out by means of the acoustic impedance corresponding to the perforated surface. This impedance is defined as the ratio of the pressure difference to the normal acoustic velocity Un[33](30)Z˜p=Pa−PmUnand depends, among others, on frequency, hole diameter, thickness, porosity, properties of the absorbent material and mean flow [39–41] (see details in Section 3.2.). Eq. (30) includes both the acoustic pressure in the absorbent material Pm, which is the field variable explicitly contained in the wave Eq. (18), and the acoustic pressure in the air Pa, related to the velocity potential Φaof the convective wave Eq. (1) through the expression (26).Several modelling possibilities can be considered regarding the acoustic phenomena close to perforated screen and the appropriate radial continuity conditions through the perforations [33,34,42–44]. Continuity of acoustic radial displacement/velocity are commonly found in the literature, and it has been experimentally demonstrated that a realistic condition is between displacement and velocity [43]. In view of the good correlation between prediction and experiment observed by Elnady et al. [44] using continuity of velocity and the numerical advantages of its implementation, this condition will be retained here for all the silencer transmission loss calculations. Therefore, the integral over Γpin the right side of the load vector Fa(see Eq. (17) for details) can be written in the form(31)Fa=∑e=1Nae∫Γae∩ΓpρaNT∂Φa∂ndΓ=∑e=1Nae∫Γae∩ΓpρaNTPa−PmZ˜pdΓ=∑e=1Nae∫Γae∩ΓpρaNT(−ρajωΦa−ρaUmf∂Φa/∂xZ˜p−PmZ˜p)dΓIn compact form, Eq.

The application of acoustic velocity does not produce any additional mathematical issue, as can be inferred from Eqs. (17) and (27). Acoustic pressure and/or anechoic termination can be also implemented by considering Eq. (28) and (29). In this case, additional matrices have to be computed and incorporated in the damping matrix of Eq. (41).Absorbent materials can be modelled as equivalent fluids [30] by using complex and frequency dependent values of speed of sound cmand density ρm(or, equivalently, the characteristic impedance Zmand wavenumber km). Empirical models such as the one proposed by Delany and Bazley [29] for rigid fibrous materials are commonly used to calculate cmand ρmin terms of the steady airflow resistivity R. Once the resistivity is known, the equivalent acoustic properties can be expressed in terms of a number of coefficients ai, i=1, 2, …, 8, derived from a curve fitting process following laboratory measurements, and the dimensionless frequency parameter ξ=ρaf/R, where ρais the air density and f the frequency [30]. In the context of the current investigation, an extension is considered with R=R(x); the frequency parameter is now a function of the coordinates (x) so that the notation ξ(x) is used. Therefore, the equivalent characteristic impedance Zmand wavenumber kmof the absorbent material are also a function of the spatial coordinates and can be calculated as [3,4,7](42)Zm(x)=Za(x)(1+a5ξ(x)a6−ja7ξ(x)a8)(43)km(x)=ka(x)(1+a3ξ(x)a4−ja1ξ(x)a2)Za=ρacabeing the characteristic impedance of the air and ka=ω/ca the associated wavenumber. Note that the coefficients and exponents ai, i=1, …, 8, are considered constant, as in earlier works related to dissipative silencers [6,7]. Thus, the apparent difficulty associated with their possible temperature dependence has been dismissed. This is consistent with the high temperature results presented by Christie [28] and the recent experimental measurements carried out by Williams et al. [31], which have shown the validity of this hypothesis to provide an accurate prediction of the absorbent material properties.Eqs. (42) and (43) are now used to evaluate the properties of the absorbent material for a given temperature distribution. A possible algorithm could be the following [6,7]. First, the properties of the air (ρa, ca, Zaand ka) can be evaluated at each integration point assuming the ideal gas law. The local resistivity can be calculated from data at a reference temperature T0 by means of the expression [20](44)R(T(x))=R(T0)μ(T(x))μ(T0)where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the air (whose reference value can be approximated by μ(T0)=1.84×10−5Pa·s for T0=25°C). For a continuously varying temperature field T(x), the viscosity μ(T(x)) can be computed by means of the Sutherland’s equation [45](45)μ(T(x))=1.458×10−6(273.15+T(x))1.5273.15+T(x)+Swhere the Sutherland constant S is a characteristic of the gas (for air, a value of 110.4K can be considered).As the temperature increases, however, the combination of Eqs. (44) and (45) leads to an overestimation of the material resistivity in comparison with Christie’s power law [28,31](46)R(T(x))=R(T0)(T(x)+273.15T0+273.15)0.6For example, an approximate deviation of 10% has been found at 500°C. Williams et al. [31] have recently provided further experimental validation to the use of Eq. (46). These authors have shown that the data measured at different temperatures collapse well onto Delany and Bazley curves if Eq. (46) is used for relating temperature and resistivity, and therefore the 0.6 power law will be used hereafter.From Eqs. (42) and (43), the equivalent density and speed of sound are readily calculated as cm=ω/kmand ρm=Zm/cm. These values are introduced in the finite element integrals (21)–(23) to obtain the final system of Eq. (41). E glass and basalt wool studied by Kirby and Cummings [46] are considered in this work, the relevant information being detailed inTable 1. The values R(T0)=30716 rayl/m (E glass with filling density ρb=120kg/m3) and R(T0)=13813 rayl/m (basalt wool with ρb=120kg/m3) are assumed. The information for a third absorbent material is also detailed in Table 1, corresponding to texturized fibre glass [32] with R(T0)=4896 rayl/m for a filling density ρb=100kg/m3.Some issues arise when a perforated duct, separating the central airway with mean flow and the absorbent material, is considered. First, how to evaluate the impact of the flow on the acoustic impedance of the perforations, and second, how to include the influence of the absorbent material. Both issues have been dealt with in the literature and a comprehensive review lies beyond the scope of this work. A number of references can be found regarding the acoustic behaviour of perforated ducts with grazing mean flow [20,33,39,41,47,48]. Good correlation with experimental results has been found in earlier studies [34] considering the model of Lee and Ih [47], which will be used in the current investigation.According to Fig. 1, the central perforated passage is parallel to the x-axis, so that x is the only relevant coordinate when computing the acoustic impedance of the surface. Following the aforementioned work [47], the dimensionless impedance of a perforated screen with grazing mean flow is expressed here as(47)ζp(x)=Zp(x)ρa(x)ca(x)=α(x)+jβ(x)where the explicit dependence on x has been included for clarity. Note that the tilde has been intentionally omitted from the impedance Zp(x) in comparison with Eq. (30) to indicate that the effect of the absorbent material is not included on the acoustic behaviour of the perforations. The real and imaginary part of ζp(x) are given respectively by(48)α(x)=α0(1+α1|f−fcrit(x)|)(1+α2M(x))(1+α3dh)(1+α4t)σ(49)β(x)=β0(1+β1dh)(1+β2t)(1+β3M(x))(1+β4f)σIn Eqs. (48) and (49), M(x) is the local mean flow Mach number, dhthe hole diameter, tpthe thickness, σ the porosity and f the frequency. In such a manner, the previous expressions are based on the assumption that the model of Lee and Ih [47] can be extended to situations where the mean flow Mach number varies with position. The critical value fcrit(x) can be evaluated using the expression(50)fcrit(x)=φ1(1+φ2M(x))(1+φ3dh)Lee and Ih [47] derived the coefficients from a curve fitting procedure to experimental data. The corresponding values are given inTable 2.Eqs. (47)–(50), however, do not include the effect of the absorbent material on the acoustic impedance of the perforated duct. This influence has received attention in several works [39–41]. In Ref. [39], the effect of a fibrous material on the impedance of the perforated surface was measured and the authors suggested adding a correction to the impedance obtained in the absence of material. The correction is based on replacing the density of air with the equivalent density ρm. Lee et al. [40] also concluded that this procedure captures the effect of the absorbent material on the perforated duct. As shown in Ref. [34], good agreement between experimental and numerical silencer transmission loss is achieved considering an expression of the form(51)Z˜p(x)=ρa(x)ca(x)(ζp(x)+j0.425ka(x)dh(ρm(x)/ρa(x)−1)F(σ)σ)where the coordinate dependence has been included here to properly model the presence of heterogeneities in the material properties as well as in the mean flow Mach number. Note that the term ζp(x) is given by Eq. (47), and therefore the expression (51) considers simultaneously the influence of the mean flow and the absorbent material on the acoustic impedance of the perforated duct. To conclude, F(σ) is related to the acoustic interaction between perforations and the following expression is considered [34,42,49](52)F(σ)=1−1.055σ+0.17(σ)3+0.035(σ)5The temperature distribution in the silencer is strongly related to a number of parameters, such as the geometrical configuration, thermal conductivities and convection heat transfer coefficients determining surface heat flux from the metallic housing to the surrounding air. In addition, convection coefficients depend on numerous fluid properties, flow conditions, vehicle speed and also the geometries of the surfaces involved [50]. Engine load and speed are relevant parameters as well, and significant temperature modifications can be found by running the engine at idle condition or accelerating to a certain speed. In Ref. [16], a method is developed for estimating the temperature profiles of the exhaust gases from the surface temperatures of the exhaust piping. Concerning the silencer, the corresponding axial temperature gradient ΔTax=Ti−To(Tiand Tobeing the inlet and outlet temperatures, respectively) associated with different vehicle models is shown to vary over a wide interval. Engines running at idle and free accelerated conditions are considered. In this latter case, the particular ranges presented in Ref. [16] at a speed of 2000rpm are 40–200°C for ΔTax, 240–725°C for Ti, and 200–650°C for To. Reference [18] shows the axial temperature gradient along an exhaust system of a single-cylinder four-stroke engine. A reactive silencer is presented whose temperature variation is ΔTax=200°C approximately, with Ti=510°C and To=315°C. Transversal temperature variations ΔTradcan be also significant in exhaust silencers, and thermal gradients higher than 100°C can be found in the literature [17], resulting in complex profiles of the relevant acoustic properties.The temperature and thermal gradients considered hereafter are based on values reported in the literature, although in some cases these have been exaggerated for a better illustration of their acoustic influence. Since the main purpose of the current investigation is to assess the impact of the thermal variations on the silencer performance, the temperature distributions used in the numerical computations are relatively simple and can be expressed analytically in terms of polynomial functions.Fig. 2 shows a sketch of the axisymmetric perforated dissipative silencer considered in the computations. As can be seen in the figure, the inlet and outlet sections are assumed to be at temperatures Tiand To, respectively. For the assessment of the thermal effects on the silencer performance, a linear temperature variationTduct(x)=b0+b1x[6,7,9–13] can be assumed between the values Tiand Tofor the central passage carrying the axially-varying mean flow M(x) [10,12,13]. At the outer chamber with absorbent material, the temperature varies according to the expression(53)Tchamber(x,r)=c0+c1x+c2r+c3xr+c4r2+c5xr2combining a linear variation along the axial direction and a quadratic law in the radial coordinate, defined from the values Tri, i=1, 2, …, 6. Note that this quadratic function is used to interpolate the approximate logarithmic temperature distribution through a cylindrical domain [50]. To evaluate the acoustic impedanceZ˜p(x)of the perforated surface at a given position, the average of Tduct(x) and Tchamber(x,r=R1) could be used. The temperature difference between both sides of the perforated surface [17] is expressed as ΔTp(x)=Tduct(x)−Tchamber(x,r=R1). For simplicity, in all the computations hereafter the value ΔTp=0 is assumed, that is, Ti=Tr1 and To=Tr4.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A finite element model has been derived for the acoustic analysis of perforated dissipative silencers with high temperature and thermal gradients in the presence of mean flow. The spatial variations of the temperature field have been shown to generate heterogeneities in the mean flow as well as in the properties of the sound propagation media (air and absorbent material). For the central passage, an acoustic velocity potential-based wave equation has been considered, valid for non-uniform mean flow and inhomogeneous fluid (air) with properties that vary with position. Concerning the outer chamber, the absorbent material has been modelled by its complex equivalent acoustic properties. The temperature-induced variations of these properties have been evaluated through a heterogeneous temperature-dependent resistivity in combination with absorbent material models obtained at room temperature. A pressure-based wave equation valid for variable properties and stationary medium has been then used with the equivalent density and speed of sound varying as functions of the spatial coordinates. The acoustic connection between the central passage and the outer chamber has been carried out by means of the acoustic impedance of the perforated duct. The dependence of this impedance on the heterogeneous properties of the absorbent material and the non-uniform mean flow has led to a spatial variation of the acoustic coupling and also to additional convective terms in the governing equations.Several computational predictions have been obtained considering different temperature fields and mean flow Mach numbers in combination with a number of absorbent materials. A detailed analysis of the silencer performance has shown that, for an accurate prediction, it is necessary to include the temperature effects when modelling the acoustic behaviour. For high material flow resistivity, increasing mean temperature have been shown to deliver a general reduction in the sound attenuation. Similar conclusions have been found for axial and radial thermal gradients, although axial temperature variations have exhibited a reduced impact. Therefore, a suitable representation of the thermal effects is required to avoid an overestimation of the silencer performance. For less resistive materials, an increase in temperature and/or thermal gradient has led to a slight drop in the silencer performance in the low to mid frequency range but the opposite trend has been found at higher frequencies, the transition point shifting to higher frequencies as the temperature gradient and/or mean flow rise. In general, for some silencer configurations it may be relatively accurate to approximate the temperature field by using a uniform profile considering an average value. It has been shown, however, that this is not always possible, the model implemented here being primarily intended for use with bulk materials having medium to high airflow resistivities. In this latter case, attenuation overestimation is likely to be predicted if the temperature distribution is not taken into account, justifying the current numerical implementation. Finally, the influence of the mean flow on the transmission loss is consistent with earlier results obtained at room temperature, with higher Mach numbers leading to a drop in the silencer performance.
