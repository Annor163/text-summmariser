@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we deal with fusion functions, i.e., mappings from [0, 1]ninto [0, 1]. As a generalization of the standard monotonicity and recently introduced weak monotonicity, we introduce and study the directional monotonicity of fusion functions. For distinguished fusion functions the sets of all directions in which they are increasing are determined. Moreover, in the paper the directional monotonicity of piecewise linear fusion functions is completely characterized. These results cover, among others, weighted arithmetic means, OWA operators, the Choquet, Sugeno and Shilkret integrals.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Aggregation of data into one representative value is an indispensable tool of majority of scientific domains which deal with quantitative information. The common framework for inputs and outputs of aggregation functions is usually the unit interval [0, 1] though other intervals can also be considered (Beliakov, Pradera, and Calvo, 2007; Grabisch, Marichal, Mesiar, and Pap, 2009). One of the mandatory properties of aggregation functions is their monotonicity (i.e., increasing monotonicity in each variable). However, there are several other fusion techniques, which are frequently applied in real data processing, and do not satisfy the monotonicity constraints of aggregation functions, e.g., implications, which are characterized by a hybrid monotonicity (Baczynski and Jayaram, 2008; Klement, Mesiar, and Pap, 2000), or the mode function (Beliakov et al., 2007; Wilkin and Beliakov, 2015) (note that in the case of more modal values, the smallest one can be considered to get a well-defined function on the entire domain [0, 1]n). Although both mentioned functions are not increasing in each variable, they have some kind of monotonicity. Several other fusion functions applied, e.g., in image processing, fuzzy systems, multicriteria decision support, etc., have some types of monotonicity on distinguished subsets of their domains. We recall a few of them only, namely, restricted equivalence functions and their complements, i.e., restricted dissimilarity functions (Bustince, Barrenechea, and Pagola, 2006; Paternain et al., 2011), bientropic functions (Bustince, Barrenechea, and Pagola, 2007; Bustince, Jurio, Pradera, Mesiar, and Beliakov, 2013) and ignorance functions (Bustince et al., 2010). Fusion functions which play the role of logic operators in fuzzy set theory were discussed in Pedrycz (2009).The monotonicity of smooth (aggregation) functions is related to the sign of their first-order partial derivatives. A function F of n variables which has the first-order partial derivatives with respect to all variables is increasing (not in the strict sense) if and only if all these derivatives are non-negative. However, in several applications, e.g., in physics or economy, directional derivatives linked to a vectorr→,which determines the considered direction, are used. Therefore, directional derivatives (and related gradients) have deeply been studied and the results on this topic can be found in any textbook of the advanced calculus. On the other hand, directional monotonicity was studied rarely, and moreover, in rather special situations only, see, e.g., Iwasa (1998). The lack of a general theory of directional monotonicity, together with the recent attempt of Wilkin and Beliakov to introduce the monotonicity of functions in the direction given by the vectorr→=(1,…,1),see Wilkin and Beliakov (2015), inspired us to start a deeper study of directional monotonicity. The aim of this paper is to generalize the theory of aggregation functions (Beliakov et al., 2007; Grabisch et al., 2009), which are usually introduced as increasing functions defined on [0, 1]nthat satisfy the boundary conditions A(0, …, 0) = 0 and A(1, …, 1) = 1. Note that the unit interval can be replaced by any interval [a, b]⊆[ − ∞, ∞] and the boundary conditions by conditions A(a, …, a) = a, A(b, …, b) = b. We introduce the notion of fusion function, i.e., an arbitrary function assigning to any n inputs x1, …, xn∈ [a, b] an output value in the same interval. Note that for any bounded interval [a, b], the linear function φ: [a, b] → [0, 1] given byφ(x)=x−ab−acan be viewed as a genuine automorphism between fusion functions G: [a, b]n→ [a, b] and F: [0, 1]n→ [0, 1], G(x1, …, xn) = φ−1(F(φ(x1), …, φ(xn)). Due to this fact, in this paper we will only deal with the unit interval [0, 1], both for inputs and outputs of fusion functions.The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, fusion functions on the interval [0, 1] and their directional monotonicity are introduced and exemplified. Section 3 is devoted to the study of some properties ofr→-monotone fusion functions. In Section 4 we discuss the setD↑(F)of all directions in which a given fusion function F is directionally increasing. Finally, in Section 5 we provide some concluding remarks.Denote by I the unit interval [0, 1]. Then In= {x = (x1, …, xn)∣xi∈ I, i = 1, …, n}.Definition 1Letn∈N,n ≥ 2. A (an n-ary) fusion function is an arbitrary function F: In→ I.In this paper, we will investigate the monotonicity (increasingness/decreasingness) of fusion functions in various directions. We will call it simply directional monotonicity. Directions will be determined by real vectorsr→=(r1,…,rn)≠0→.Definition 2Letr→be a real n-dimensional vector,r→≠0→. A fusion function F: In→ I isr→-increasing (r→-decreasing) if for all points x ∈ Inand all c > 0 such thatx+cr→∈In,it holds that(1)F(x+cr→)≥F(x)(F(x+cr→)≤F(x)).(i)Clearly, for any α > 0 the increasing/decreasing monotonicity of a fusion function F in the directionαr→is equivalent to the same property in the directionr→.If a fusion function F: In→ I has continuous first-order partial derivatives with respect to all variables (which ensures the differentiability of F) then it has the directional derivative in the direction of anyr→≠0→at each point x ∈ Inadmitting a positive constant c > 0 such thatx+cr→∈In(such a point will be called an admissible point). Consequently, F isr→-increasing (r→-decreasing) if and only if its directional derivative in the direction ofr→is non-negative (non-positive) at each admissible point x ∈ In. Note that given a fusion function F: In→ I, a vectorr→≠0→and an admissible point x ∈ In, the directional derivative of F in the direction ofr→at x is here defined as the limitlimc→0F(x+cr→)−F(x)c|r→|(if the limit exists).From now on, the set of all real n-dimensional vectorsr→≠0→will be denoted by Vn.Example 1The Łukasiewicz implication IL: I2 → I, IL(x, y) = min {1, 1 − x + y}, is (1, 1)-increasing. Indeed, for all points (x, y) ∈ I2 and all c > 0, such that (x, y) + c(1, 1) = (x + c, y + c) ∈ I2, we haveIL(x+c,y+c)=min{1,1−x−c+y+c}=min{1,1−x+y}=IL(x,y).Note that ILis also a (1, 1)-decreasing fusion function. However, e.g., the Reichenbach implication IR: I2 → I, IR(x, y) = 1 − x + xy, is neither (1, 1)-increasing nor (1, 1)-decreasing. If we considerr→=(1,1)and take, for example, x = (0.1, 0.2) and c = 0.2, thenx+cr→=(0.3,0.4),and we have IR(0.3, 0.4) = 0.82 and IR(0.1, 0.2) = 0.92, i.e., IRis not (1, 1)-increasing. If we consider x = (0.4, 0.5) and c = 0.2, thenx+cr→=(0.6,0.7)and because IR(0.6, 0.7) = 0.82 > IR(0.4, 0.5) = 0.8, IRis not (1, 1)-decreasing.Consider the function F: I2 → I, F(x, y) = x − (max {0, x − y})2, i.e., F(x, y) = x if x ≤ y, and F(x, y) = x − (x − y)2 if x > y. F is a continuous fusion function, but not an aggregation function (its monotonicity in the first coordinate fails). F is, e.g., (1, 1)-increasing, (0, 1)-increasing, but it is neither (1, 0)-increasing nor (1, 0)-decreasing.For showing that F is (1, 1)-increasing, it is enough to notice that for all points (x, y) ∈ I2 and all c > 0, such that (x, y) + c(1, 1) = (x + c, y + c) ∈ I2, it holds that F(x + c, y + c) = F(x, y) + c > F(x, y).To see that F is (0, 1)-increasing, notice that for all (x, y) ∈ ]0, 1[2, its partial derivative∂F∂yis∂F∂y(x,y)=0for x ≤ y and∂F∂y(x,y)=2(x−y)for x > y, i.e., it is always non-negative.However, F is notr→=(1,0)-increasing, because if we take, e.g., the point x = (0.7, 0.2) and c = 0.2, we obtainF(x+cr→)=F(0.9,0.2)=0.41,but F(x) = F(0.7, 0.2) = 0.45. Similarly, for y = (0.4, 0.3) and c = 0.2 we obtainF(y+cr→)=F(0.6,0.3)=0.51>F(0.4,0.3)=0.31,i.e., F is not (1, 0)-decreasing.The weighted Lehmer mean Lλ: I2 → I,Lλ(x,y)=λx2+(1−λ)y2λx+(1−λ)y(with convention00=0), where λ ∈ ]0, 1[, is (1 − λ, λ)-increasing.Let (x, y) ∈ I2 and c > 0 such that (x + c(1 − λ), y + cλ) ∈ I2. The inequality Lλ(x + c(1 − λ), y + cλ) ≥ Lλ(x, y), i.e.,λ(x+c(1−λ))2+(1−λ)(y+cλ)2λ(x+c(1−λ))+(1−λ)(y+cλ)≥λx2+(1−λ)y2λx+(1−λ)yis equivalent toλ(1−λ)c(λc(x−y)+(c+2x)y)≥0,and next toλc(x−y)+(c+2x)y≥0,andthustoy(2x+c(1−λ))+cλx≥0.The last inequality always holds because y, 2x + c(1 − λ) and cλx are non-negative numbers.□It is easy to see that the function F: I2 → I,F(x,y)={0ifx=y=1/21/2if{x,y}∩{0,1}≠∅1otherwise,is notr→-monotone in any directionr→.In the next example, which comes from a real decision problem, the notion of directional monotonicity is relevant.Example 5Let us consider the following situation. A person is detected to be ill with diabetes. There are four possible medicaments for him, m1, m2, m3 and m4. Each of these medicaments is evaluated according to the following criteria:C1:Diffusion velocity in the body.Effective reduction of the amount of sugar in blood.Risk of heart attack.Increasing of arterial tension.Risk of liver complications.Clearly, the first two criteria can be considered to be positive, since the more some medicament satisfies them, the more desirable that medicament is. In the same way, the other three criteria can be considered to be negative, since, the more they are fulfilled by a given medicament, the less advisable that medicament is.To decide the specific treatment for a given patient, doctors build a decision matrix in which entries are values in the interval [0, 1].(C1C2C3C4C5m10.80.60.50.30.4m20.30.50.40.70.1m30.20.40.10.70.7m40.80.90.10.20.9)In particular, the (i, j)-entry in this matrix measures up to what extent the criterion Cjis fulfilled by the medicament mi.To decide from this matrix, doctors consider the functionF(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5)=(w1x1+w2x2+w3x3+w4x4+w5x5)+12where the weighting vectorw→∈[−1,1]5is such that1.w1, w2 ∈ [0, 1], w1 + w2 = 1;w3, w4, w5 ∈ [ − 1, 0]; w3 + w4 + w5 = −1.The weighting vectorw→depends on the characteristics of each particular patient. For instance, if a patient has a medical history which includes previous heart attacks, the value of w3 will be near to − 1. This translates into a mathematical language the fact that the first two criteria are positive, so a fulfillment as high as possible is intended for them, whereas the three last criteria are negative, a fulfillment as small as possible is intended in this case. Moreover, if positive criteria dominate over the negative ones, the final outcome will be between 0.5 and 1, whereas if the negative ones dominate, the final result will be between 0 and 0.5. Note that in this setting, F is a function which is monotone increasing in the directions defined by the vectorw→,see below.In this specific example, if we aggregate the values in each of the rows using the operator F and the weighting vectorw→=(0.7,0.3,−0.3,−0.5,−0.2),we get•Row 1: 0.680Row 2: 0.435Row 3: 0.370Row 4: 0.760So, in this case the preferable medicament is m4.Note that F is a fusion function, which isr→-increasing in the direction of any vectorr→=(r1,…,r5)such that∑i=15wiri=0.7r1+0.3r2−0.3r3−0.5r4−0.2r5≥0.In particular, F is (1, …, 1)-increasing (in fact (1, …, 1)-constant) but F is not an aggregation function.In multicriteria decision support theory, an important role is played by utility functions. Normed utility functions coincide with aggregation functions, and their monotonicity expresses the Pareto principle. In the case when some of the criteria are positive and some of them negative (see Example 5, where the criteria C1, C2 are positive and the criteria C3, C4, C5 are negative), to apply an aggregation function it is first necessary to rescale negative criteria into positive ones. This step can be avoided when fusion functions which arer→-increasing in the direction of anyr→with non-negative coordinates for positive criteria and non-positive coordinates for negative criteria are considered. So, for example, the fusion function F: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] that is given by F(x, y) = 1 − xy isr→-increasing for anyr→=(r1,r2)∈V2with r1 ≤ 0 andr→2≤0. Hence, this fusion function can be considered as a utility function when we deal with two negative criteria.We end this section by making clear the relation between aggregation functions and fusion functions. For each i ∈ {1, …, n}, lete→i=(ϵ1,…,ϵn),with εi= 1 and εj= 0 for each j ≠ i. A fusion function F: In→ I is increasing if and only if for each i = 1, …, n, each partial function Fiof one variable xiis increasing. Note that for a fixed (a1, …, an) ∈ In, Fi: I → I is given by Fi(xi) = F(a1, …, ai − 1, xi, ai + 1, …, an). This means that the increasing monotonicity of a fusion function F is equivalent to thee→i-increasing monotonicity of F for all i. So, aggregation functions A: In→ I are fusion functions, which aree→i-increasing for each i = 1, …, n, and satisfy the boundary conditions A(0, …, 0) = 0 and A(1, …, 1) = 1, compare, e.g., Beliakov et al. (2007); Grabisch et al. (2009).Similarly, implications I: I2 → I aree→1-decreasing ande→2-increasing fusion functions, which satisfy the boundary conditions I(0, 0) = I(1, 1) = 1 and I(1, 0) = 0.In this section we will study several important properties ofr→-monotone fusion functions.Proposition 1A fusion function F: In→ I isr→-decreasing if and only if F is(−r→)-increasing.Let F ber→-decreasing. Let x ∈ In, c > 0 such thatx+c(−r→)∈In. Putx+c(−r→)=y. ThenF(x+c(−r→))=F(y)≥F(y+cr→)=F(x),i.e., F is(−r→)-increasing. And similarly vice versa.□By the previous proposition it is enough to formulate the claims for directionally increasing fusion functions only.Now, we will investigate whether a fusion function F isu→-increasing whenever it isr→- ands→-increasing andu→=ar→+bs→with a, b > 0. Note, for example, that each aggregation function A: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] isr→=(0,1)- ands→=(1,0)-increasing, and alsou→-increasing for each vectoru→=ar→+bs→=(a,b)with a, b > 0. But if we consider the weakest aggregation function A*, given byA*(x,y)={1ifx=y=10otherwise,it is easy to see that A* isr→-increasing for allr→=(r1,r2)∈V2except the vectors with r1 ≤ 0 and r2 ≤ 0, i.e., vectors in the third quadrant of the plane. By definition, this function isr→=(−1,0.5)-increasing ands→=(1,−2)-increasing, but it is notu→-increasing foru→=r→+0.5s→=(−0.5,−0.5). Indeed, taking the point x = (1, 1), for any pointx+cu→in the unit square, we obtain the valueA*(x+cu→)=0which is less than A*(x) = 1.Theorem 1Letr→ands→be vectors in Vn, such that for a given a, b ≥ 0, a + b > 0, it holds that for each point x in Inand c > 0 such thatx+cu→is in In, whereu→=ar→+bs→,the pointsx+car→orx+cbs→are also in In. Then, if a fusion function F: In→ I is bothr→- ands→-increasing then it is alsou→-increasing.It is enough to mention that for each x ∈ In, c > 0 such thatx+cu→∈Inand alsox+car→∈In,it holdsF(x+cu→)=F(x+car→+cbs→)≥F(x+car→)≥F(x),where the first inequality follows from thes→-increasing monotonicity of F and the second from ther→-increasing monotonicity of F. The same result is obtained if the conditionx+cbs→∈Inis ensured.□Letr→=(r1,…,rn)ands→=(s1,…,sn)be vectors in Vnthat satisfy the conditiondr→,s→:=card{i∈{1,…,n}∣risi≥0}≥n−1and let a fusion function F: In→ I ber→-increasing ands→-increasing. Then F isu→-increasing for eachu→=ar→+bs→with a, b ≥ 0, a + b > 0.The result is obvious if a · b = 0, so we can only consider that a, b > 0.Suppose that x ∈ Inand c > 0 such thatx+cu→∈In.Ifdr→,s→=n,then for each i ∈ {1, …, n}, both numbers xi+ cariand xi+ cbsiare contained in the interval determined by the endpoints xiand xi+ cari+ cbsi= xi+ cui, and hence, they are in I. Thus, the pointsx+car→andx+cbs→are in In, and the result already follows from Theorem 1.Now, suppose thatdr→,s→=n−1and let rjsj< 0. As in the first case, for all i ≠ j, xi+ cariand xi+ cbsiare in I. Consider, e.g., rj> 0 (and thus sj< 0) and uj> 0. Asx+cu→∈Infor some c > 0, necessarily xj+ cuj≤ 1, and hence xj< 1. Clearly,cuj=carj+cbsjandxj+cuj≤1.Letarjuj=p+α,andbsjuj=t+β,where p, t ∈ {0, 1, …} and α, β ∈ [0, 1[. Then p > t. Moreover,xj+ujarjcarj=xj+cuj,xj+ujarjcarj+uj−bsjcbsj=xj,and thusx+ujarjcar→,x+ujarjcar→+uj−bsjcbs→,…,x+tujarjcar→+(t−1)uj−bsjcbs→,x+tujarjcar→+tuj−bsjcbs→,x+(t+1)ujarjcar→+tuj−bsjcbs→,x+(t+1)ujarjcar→+cbs→,x+car→+cbs→∈In.Now, the result follows from Theorem 1. Similar arguments can be used in all cases when uj≠ 0.On the other hand, if uj= 0, i.e., arj+ bsj= 0, again considering rj> 0, first suppose that xj< 1. Now, we can use similar arguments as above, only consideringcarj1−xj=−cbsj1−xjinstead ofarjujand−bsjuj(note that now p = t and α = β).If xj= 1, we only change the roles ofr→ands→and consider carj= −cbsj= t + β. If t = 0, it is enough to deal withx+cbs→,x+cbs→+car→∈In.If t > 0, it is enough to observe that thenx+−1cbsjcbs→,x+−1cbsjcbs→+1carjcar→,…,x+t−1cbsjcbs→+(t−1)1carjcar→,x+t−1cbsjcbs→+t1carjcar→,x+(t+β)−1cbsjcbs→+t1carjcar→,x+(t+β)−1cbsjcbs→+(t+β)1carjcar→∈In.□It can be difficult to check the constraints given in Theorem 1, therefore simple sufficient conditions, which are stated in the following theorem, can be very useful, see also Remark 1 (ii).Theorem 2Let a fusion function F: In→ I have continuous first-order partial derivatives with respect to each variable. If F isr→-increasing ands→- increasing for some directionsr→ands→in Vn, then F is alsou→increasing for eachu→=ar→+bs→,where a ≥ 0, b ≥ 0, a + b > 0.The next results concern the preservation ofr→-monotonicity. For the transformed fusion functions φ(F) we have the following simple result.Proposition 2Let F: In→ I be anr→-increasing fusion function. If φ: I → I is an increasing (decreasing) function then G = φ○F is anr→-increasing (decreasing) fusion function.The function G = φ○F is a fusion function. Let x ∈ In, c > 0 such thatx+cr→∈In. AsF(x+cr→)≥F(x),if φ is an increasing function, we obtainG(x+cr→)=φ(F(x+cr→))≥φ(F(x))=G(x).The opposite inequality is obtained for a decreasing φ.□The next proposition gives a sufficient condition for ther→-decreasing monotonicity of the composition of fusion functions.Proposition 3Let F1, …, Fk: In→ I ber→-increasing fusion functions and let F: Ik→ I be an increasing function. Then the function G = F(F1, …, Fk) is anr→-increasing fusion function.The composed function G is a fusion function. Let x ∈ In, c > 0 such thatx+cr→∈In. Due to ther→-increasing monotonicity of all Fiand increasing monotonicity of F it holds thatG(x+cr→)=F(F1(x+cr→),…,Fk(x+cr→))≥F(F1(x),…,Fk(x))=G(x).□Note that in the previous proposition, ther→-increasing monotonicity of F is not sufficient for ther→-increasing monotonicity of G. For example, consider the functions F, F1, F2: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1], given by F1(x, y) = x − (max {0, x − y})2, see Example 2, F2(x, y) = IL(x, y) (Example 1), andF(x,y)=x2+y2x+y,i.e., the Lehmer mean for λ = 1/2, see Example 3. We have already shown that all these functions are (1, 1)-increasing. Put G = F(F1, F2). AsG(x,x)=x2+1x+1,it holds G(0, 0) = 1, G(1/2, 1/2) = 5/6, and G(1, 1) = 1, which shows that G is not (1, 1)-increasing.The next result concerns the directional monotonicity of transformed increasing fusion functions.Proposition 4Let F: In→ I be an increasing fusion function and fi: [0, 1] → [0, 1], i = 1, …, n, be monotone functions. If a function G: In→ I is defined byG(x1,…,xn)=F(f1(x1),…,fn(xn)),then G isr→-increasing for each vectorr→=(r1,…,rn)with the property:∀ i ∈ {1, …, n},  ri≥ 0 if fiis increasing and ri≤ 0 if fiis decreasing.If fiis increasing and ri≥ 0, then for any c > 0 such that all considered points are in I, it holds that xi+ cri≥ xiand fi(xi+ cri) ≥ f(xi). Similarly, if fiis decreasing and ri≤ 0, then xi+ cri≤ xiand fi(xi+ cri) ≥ f(xi). The result already follows from the increasing monotonicity of the fusion function F.□Proposition 4 only gives a sufficient condition forr→-increasing monotonicity of G. The function G can also ber→-increasing for some other vectorsr→,as is shown in the following example.Example 6Consider the implications IS: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] of the form IS(x, y) = S(n(x), y), where S is a t-conorm and n a negation (see Klement et al., 2000). By the previous proposition, the functions ISare certainlyr→-increasing for allr→=(r1,r2)∈V2with r1 ≤ 0 and r2 ≥ 0, i.e., for vectorsr→lying in the second quadrant of the plane. But as we have seen earlier, the Łukasiewicz implication IL, which can be defined in this manner for the Łukasiewicz t-conorm SL(x, y) = min {1, x + y} and the standard negation ns(x) = 1 − x, is also (1, 1)-increasing and ( − 1, −1)-increasing. The set of all vectorsr→with respect to which ILisr→-increasing, is given in Example 8(ii).By Theorem 1, each aggregation function A: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] isr→-increasing at least for allr→=(r1,r2)∈V2with r1 ≥ 0 and r2 ≥ 0, i.e., for vectors lying in the first quadrant of the plane. But, as we have already seen, the weakest aggregation function A* isr→-increasing for allr→=(r1,r2)with the exception of the vectors with r1 ≤ 0 and r2 ≤ 0.Similarly, the next result can easily be proved. We omit the proof.Proposition 5Let F: In→ I be anr→-increasing fusion function and let functions g, fi∈ {idI, 1 − idI}, i = 1, …, n. If a function H: In→ I is defined byH(x1,…,xn)=g(F(f1(x1),…,fn(xn))),then H iss→-increasing wheres→=(−1)g(0)((−1)f1(0)r1,…,(−1)fn(0)rn).In the framework of aggregation functions, the standard dual function to an aggregation function A is defined by Ad(x1, …, xn) = 1 − A(1 − x1, …, 1 − xn). Define a dual to a fusion function F in the same manner, i.e., Fd(x) = 1 − F(1 − x). Then we have the following property which is a consequence of Proposition 5.Corollary 2If a fusion function F: In→ I isr→-increasing then its dual Fdis alsor→-increasing.Functions F and Fdarer→-increasing with respect to the same set of vectors.The claim follows from Corollary 2 and the property (Fd)d= F.□Note that for any fusion function F: In→ I, the functionF+Fd2:In→Iis a self-dual function, which isr→-increasing whenever F isr→-increasing. This is a consequence of Corollary 2 and Proposition 3. On the other hand, the anti-self-dual function which is given byF−Fd2need not be in general a fusion function. For example, for the function F: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1], F(x, y) = xy, we haveF−Fd2(x,y)=xy−x+y2,and the value of this function at the point (0.5, 0.5) equals − 0.25∉[0, 1].Finally, let us introduce the notion ofr→-constant functions, and have a look at some properties of such functions.Definition 3A function F: In→ I which isr→-increasing and also(−r→)-increasing will be called anr→-constant fusion function.For example, as mentioned earlier, the Łukasiewicz implication is (1, 1)-increasing and also ( − 1, −1)-increasing, so it is (1, 1)-constant. Similarly, the Łukasiewicz t-norm TL: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1], given by TL(x, y) = max {0, x + y − 1}, is clearly (1, −1)-increasing, and also ( − 1, 1)-increasing, i.e., TLis a (1, −1)-constant fusion function. Forr→-constant functions we have the following property.Proposition 6A fusion function F: In→ I isr→-constant if and only if F(x) = F(y) for all x, y ∈ Insuch thatx=y+kr→for somek∈R.⇒: Let F ber→-constant and let x, y ∈ Inbe such thatx=y+kr→for somek∈R.If k > 0, usingr→-increasing monotonicity of F, we obtainF(x)=F(y+kr→)≥F(y),and using(−r→)-increasing monotonicity of F, we obtainF(y)=F(x+k(−r→))≥F(x).Thus F(x) = F(y). For k < 0 the proof can be done similarly.⇐: Let x ∈ In, c > 0 such thatx+c(−r→)∈In. Putx+c(−r→)=y. By the assumption F(y) = F(x), thusF(x+c(−r→))=F(x),i.e., F is(−r→)-increasing. In the same way one can prove ther→-increasing monotonicity of F.□It is evident that a fusion function F isr→-constant if and only if itsr→-directional derivative at each admissible point equals zero.Note that for an arbitrary vectorr→=(r1,…,rn)∈Vn,and for allv→=(v1,…,vn)∈Vnsuch that∑i=1nviri=0(i.e., the scalar productv→.r→=0), the functionFv→:In→Iwhich is given by(2)Fv→(x)=∑i=1nvixi−∑i=1nmin{0,vi}∑i=1n|vi|is anr→-constant fusion function. Moreover,Fv→is a linear function with a full range [0, 1], i.e.,Fv→is surjective. Further, ifv→.r→=0then also(−v→).r→=0,and(3)F−v→(x)=∑i=1n−vixi−∑i=1nmin{0,−vi}∑i=1n|vi|=∑i=1nmax{0,vi}−∑i=1nvixi∑i=1n|vi|=1−Fv→(x).For n = 2, we have the following complete characterization ofr→-constant fusion functions.Proposition 7Letr→=(r1,r2)∈V2. Then F: I2 → I is anr→-constant fusion function if and only if there is a function f: [0, 1] → [0, 1] such that(4)F(x,y)=f(F(r2,−r1)(x,y))=f(r2x−r1y+max{0,r1}−min{0,r2}|r1|+|r2|).The sufficiency is obvious. To see the necessity, recall that by Proposition 6, ther→-constant property of F means that F(x1, y1) = F(x2, y2) whenever (x1, y1) = (x2 + kr1, y2 + kr2) for somek∈R. This equality holds if and only ifr2x1−r1y1+max{0,r1}−min{0,r2}|r1|+|r2|=r2x2−r1y2+max{0,r1}−min{0,r2}|r1|+|r2|.Moreover, for each (x, y) ∈ I2, the numberr2x−r1y+max{0,r1}−min{0,r2}|r1|+|r2|is in I, and for each t ∈ I, there is a point (x(t), y(t)) ∈ I2 such thatt=r2x(t)−r1y(t)+max{0,r1}−min{0,r2}|r1|+|r2|.Now, it is enough to consider the function f given byf(t)=F(x(t),y(t)).□Considerr→=(1,−1). Forv→=(1,1),F(1,1)(x,y)=x+y2,i.e., F(1, 1) is the standard arithmetic mean. Each (1, −1)-constant fusion function F: I2 → I can be expressed in the formF(x,y)=f(x+y2). Especially, for the Łukasiewicz t-norm TLwe have f(t) = max {0, 2t − 1}, and for the Łukasiewicz t-conorm SL, f(t) = min {2x, 1}.For a fusion function F: In→ I, letD↑(F)be a set of all real vectorsr→=(r1,…,rn)∈Vnfor which F isr→-increasing.We first show some simple examples.Example 8(i)Consider the Łukasiewicz t-norm TL: I2 → I. For x = (x, y),r→=(r1,r2)we haveTL(x+cr→)=max(0,x+y−1+c(r1+r2)). For each x ∈ I2, c > 0 such thatx+cr→∈I2it holds thatTL(x+cr→)≥TL(x)if and only if r1 + r2 ≥ 0. ThusD↑(TL)={r→=(r1,r2)∣r2≥−r1}.So,D↑(TL)is a superset of the minimal set of vectorsD*↑={r→=(r1,r2)∣r1≥0,r2≥0}with respect to which each aggregation function isr→-increasing. Moreover, the same set of directions corresponds to the Łukasiewicz t-conorm SL, i.e.,D↑(SL)=D↑(TL),becauseSL=TDd,see Corollary 3.As we have mentioned earlier,D↑(IL)⫆{r→=(r1,r2)∣r1≤0,r2≥0}. In fact,D↑(IL)={r→=(r1,r2)∣r2≥r1}. This follows either directly from the definition ofr→-increasingness of ILor, e.g., from the fact that IL(x, y) = 1 − TL(x, 1 − y), see Proposition 5 and item (i) of this example.Overlap functions GO: I2 → I, which were introduced in Bustince, Fernandez, Mesiar, Montero, and Orduna (2010) and applied in many other papers, are characterized by symmetry, monotonicity, continuity and boundary conditions GO(x, y) = 0 if and only if xy = 0 and GO(x, y) = 1 if and only if xy = 1. Clearly, each overlap function GOis an aggregation function for whichD↑(GO)=D*↑. Obviously, their dual functionsGG=GOd,which are called grouping functions (Bustince, Pagola, Mesiar, Hüllermeier, and Herrera, 2012), are characterized by the same set of directions,D↑(GG)=D↑(GO).As we have seen in Example 4, there are fusion functions F with empty set of directions of increasingness,D↑(F)=∅. We have the next sufficient condition for such fusion functions.Proposition 8Let F: In→ I be a fusion function with a strict local extreme at point x0 ∈ ]0, 1[n. ThenD↑(F)=∅.It is enough to mention that F has a strict local minimum (maximum) at x0 ∈ ]0, 1[nif and only if there is an ε > 0 such that F(x) > F(x0) (F(x) < F(x0)) for all x ∈ ]0, 1[nsuch that the Euclidean norm 0 < ‖x − x0‖ < ε.□On the other hand, for aggregation functions we have the next result.Proposition 9Let A: In→ I be an aggregation function with annihilator a ∈ [0, 1[ such that for each x ∈ ]a, 1], A(x, …, x) > a. ThenD↑(A)is minimal, i.e.,D↑(A)={r→∈Vn∣r1≥0,…,rn≥0}=Vn+.It is enough to observe that for eachr→∈Vn∖Vn+there is an x ∈ ]a, 1] and c > 0 such thatA((x,…,x)+cr→)≤a<A(x,…,x).□From Example 3, it follows that the Lehmer mean L1/2 is (1, 1)-increasing (i.e., weakly monotone in terminology used by Wilkin and Beliakov, 2015), see also Wilkin, Beliakov, and Calvo (2014). We can also prove a stronger result. The notation L1/2 will be shorten to L.Proposition 10Let L: I2 → I be the Lehmer mean given byL(x,y)=x2+y2x+y.The only vectors with respect to which the function L isr→-increasing are vectorsr→=α(1,1)with α > 0.We have to show that L is notr→-increasing forr→=(r1,r2)≠α(1,1)with α > 0. We divide the proof into 5 steps.(i)Fix a ∈ ]0, 1[ and consider y = a + (1 − a)x. ThenL(x,y)=x2+(a+(1−a)x)2x+a+(1−a)x:=fa(x).It is easy to check that fa(0) = a, fa(1) = 1, and hence facannot be decreasing. The derivative from the rightfa′(0+)=−(1−a)2a<0,i.e., fais not increasing. Thus L cannot ber→-increasing for vectorsr→=k(1,1−a),withk∈R∖{0}.Similarly as in the case (i), considering x = a + (1 − a)y, we can prove that L cannot ber→-increasing forr→=k(1−a,1),withk∈R∖{0}.Fix a ∈ [0, 1] and consider y = 1 − (1 − a)x. ThenL(x,y)=x2+(1+(1−a)x)21+ax:=ha(x).Clearly, ha(0) = 1 andha(1)=1+a21+a.Moreover, the derivative from the left,ha′(1−)=2+3a−3a2(1+a)2>0,i.e., hais neither increasing nor decreasing. Consequently, L cannot ber→-increasing forr→=k(1,−(1−a)),withk∈R∖{0}.Similarly as in the case (iii), considering x = 1 − (1 − a)y, we can show that L cannot ber→-increasing forr→=k(−(1−a),1),withk∈R∖{0}.It only remains to check the vectorsr→=k(−1,−1)with k > 0. The fact that the Lehmer mean is idempotent, i.e., L(x, x) = x for each x, excludes the possibility that L isr→-increasing for this type of vectors.Summarizing, we getD↑(L)={α(1,1)∣α>0}.□It can be shown that in general for the weighted Lehmer mean Lλ, λ ∈ ]0, 1[, see Example 3, it holds thatD↑(Lλ)={α(1−λ,λ)∣α>0}.Now, consider a continuous fusion function F: In→ I obtained by a patchwork technique, i.e., suppose that Inis splitted into k connected subsets E1, …, Ekwith positive volumes covering In, i.e.,⋃j=1kEj=In,and that there exist functionsBj:In→R,j = 1, …, k, such thatF|Ej=Bj|Ej. Then clearly F isr→-increasing whenever each Bjisr→-increasing. Note that the notion of directional monotonicity, which was given in Definition 2, can be extended to functions with any domain E with positive volume and any real range.In several applications, linear/piecewise linear fusion functions are considered. Recall that a continuous fusion function F is piecewise linear if and only if it can be obtained by the described patchwork technique with linear functions Bj, j = 1, …, k.For continuous piecewise linear functions we have the following characterization of directional increasing monotonicity.Lemma 1If F: In→ I is a continuous piecewise linear fusion function determined by linear functions B1, …, Bk, thenD↑(F)=⋂j=1kD↑(Bj).The next result shows that in the case of linear fusion functions, their directional monotonicity can be reduced to the directional monotonicity on a proper subset of the domain In.Lemma 2The next claims are equivalent:(i)A linear function F: In→ I isr→-increasing.For a fixed connected set E⊆Inwith positive volume, F|Eisr→-increasing.The following proposition clarifies theD↑sets of linear fusion functions.Proposition 11Let a fusion function F: In→ I be linear, i.e.,F(x)=b+∑i=1naixi. ThenD↑(F)={(r1,…,rn)∈Vn∣∑i=1nairi≥0}and F isr→-constant if and only if∑i=1nairi=0.It is enough to observe that for all possible pointsF(x+cr→)=F(x)+c∑i=1nairi.□Clearly,D↑(F)=Vnif and only if a1 = … = an= 0, i.e., if F is a constant function.Remark 5From the geometrical point of view, the setD↑(F),which has been described in Proposition 11, can be seen as a half-space whose boundary is the hyperplane determined by the origin (0, …, 0) and the normal vectora→=(a1,…,an).Letw→=(w1,…,wn)be a weighting vector, i.e., for each i ∈ {1, …, n}, wi≥ 0 and∑i=1nwi=1. LetWw→:In→Ibe a weighted arithmetic mean,Ww→(x1,…,xn)=∑i=1nwixi. ThenD↑(Ww→)={(r1,…,rn)∈Vn∣∑i=1nwiri≥0}.The continuous piecewise linear fusion function F: I2 → I, F(x, y) = min {x, y, 1 − x, 1 − y}, was applied in several works, e.g., in Klement, Mesiar, and Pap (2005). F can be viewed as a fusion function obtained by a patchwork technique related to the projections P1, P2 and functions 1 − P1 and 1 − P2. ThusD↑(F)=D↑(P1)∩D↑(P2)∩D↑(1−P1)∩D↑(1−P2)=∅. This means that there is no directionr→in which F isr→-monotone. Note that this result also follows from Proposition 8. Indeed, at the point x0 = (1/2, 1/2) the function F attains its strict global maximum.Note that OWA operators (Yager, 1988) and the Choquet integrals (Choquet, 1953; Grabisch, 1995) are special piecewise linear fusion functions. The Choquet integrals and their applications are the topic of several studies, e.g. Angilella, Greco, and Matarazzo (2010); Marichal (2007). Among many applications of OWA operators we only recall (Llamazares, 2004) and the recent monograph (Yager, Kacprzyk, and Beliakov, 2011). We first recall the definitions of an OWA operator and the Choquet integral. In what follows, [n] = {1, …, n} and 2[n] denotes the set of all subsets of [n].An OWA operatorAw→:In→Icorresponding to a weighting vectorw→=(w1,…,wn)is defined by(5)Aw→(x)=∑i=1nwixσ(i),where σ: [n] → [n] is any permutation such that xσ(1) ≤ xσ(2) ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ xσ(n).Having a capacity μ: 2[n] → I, i.e., a set function with properties–μ(∅) = 0, μ([n]) = 1,for all E1, E2⊆[n], E1⊆E2⇒μ(E1) ≤ μ(E2),the Choquet integral corresponding to the capacity μ is defined by(6)Chμ(x)=∑i=1nxσ(i)(μ({σ(i),…,σ(n)})−μ({σ(i+1),…,σ(n)}))with convention {σ(n + 1), σ(n)} = ∅. Denotingwσ,iμ=μ({σ(i),…,σ(n)})−μ({σ(i+1),…,σ(n)}),we obtainChμ(x)=∑i=1nwσ,iμxσ(i).Note that a capacity μ is called symmetric whenever μ(E1) = μ(E2) for all E1, E2⊆[n] with the same cardinality. For symmetric measures the valueswσ,iμ,do not depend on the permutation σ, and then the Choquet integral is an OWA operator,Chμ=Aw→μ.From Proposition 11 and Lemma 1 one can deduce the following consequences for OWA operators and the Choquet integrals.Corollary 5LetAw→:In→Ibe an OWA operator that corresponds to a weighting vectorw→(defined by (5)). Then(7)D↑(Aw→)=⋂σ∈ΩD↑(Wσ(w→))=⋂σ∈Ω{r→=(r1,…,rn)∈Vn∣∑i=1nwσ(i)ri≥0},where Ω is the set of all permutations σ: [n] → [n] andσ(w→)=(wσ(1),…,wσ(n)).Note that (7) can also be written asD↑(Aw→)={r→=(r1,…,rn)∈Vn∣∀σ∈Ω:∑i=1nwσ(i)ri≥0}.Corollary 6Let Chμbe the Choquet integral that corresponds to a capacity μ. Then(8)D↑(Chμ)=⋂σ∈ΩD↑(Wσ(μ))=⋂σ∈Ω{r→=(r1,…,rn)∈Vn∣∑i=1nwσ,iμri≥0}.Again, (8) can be written asD↑(Chμ)={r→=(r1,…,rn)∈Vn∣∀σ∈Ω:∑i=1nwσ,iμri≥0}.Example 10Consider the OWA operator A: I2 → I,A(x,y)=13min{x,y}+23max{x,y}. ThenD↑(A)=D↑(W(1/3,2/3))∩D↑(W(2/3,1/3))={(r1,r2)∈V2∣r1+2r2≥0,2r1+r2≥0},see Fig. 1.Consider the capacity μ: 2[2] → I, μ({1}) = 0.3, μ({2}) = 0.4 and the Choquet integral with respect to μ, i.e.,Chμ(x,y)={0.3x+0.7yifx≥y,0.6x+0.4yifx≤y.ThenD↑(Chμ)={(r1,r2)∈V2∣0.3r1+0.7r2≥0,0.6r1+0.4r2≥0},see Fig. 2.Let us note that the Sugeno integral (Sugeno, 1974), Shilkret integral (Shilkret, 1971), hierarchical Choquet integral (Fujimoto, Sugeno, and Murofushi, 1995; Mesiar and Vivona, 1999), twofold integral (Torra and Narukawa, 2004) are also continuous piecewise linear functions, which allows to determine the set of all directions in which they are increasing. Consider, for example, the Sugeno integral. According to Couceiro and Marichal (2010), for any capacity μ this integral is either constant or it coincides with some argument xion each domain of linearity. Therefore, it isr→-increasing for anyr→∈Vn,r→=(r1.…,rn),where ri≥ 0 if xicoincides with this Sugeno integral on some non-trivial domain, otherwiseri∈R.By Lemma 1 and Proposition 11, it is not difficult to check that for each continuous piecewise linear fusion function F: In→ I,D↑(F)is a special cone in Vn. For n = 2 we also have the opposite claim. Before stating the result we recall the notion of a cone.For any subset ∅ ≠ H⊆Vn, letK={∑h→∈Hahh→∈Vn∣ah≥0,{h→∈H∣ah>0}iscountable,0<∑h→∈Hah<∞}.Then K is called a cone in Vn.Proposition 12For any cone K⊆V2 there is a continuous piecewise linear function F: I2 → I such thatK=D↑(F).If K = V2, it is enough to consider any constant fusion function. Each cone K ≠ V2 is generated by two unit vectorsr→=(cosφ,sinφ)ands→=(cosη,sinη),where φ, η are angles satisfying φ ≤ η and η − φ ≤ π. To each cone K we can assign a piecewise linear function F such thatD↑(F)=K,where coefficients of linear functions are determined by means of Proposition 11 and relations (2) and (3). Namely, let F = min {F( − sin φ, cos φ), F(sin η, −cos η)}, where functions F( − sin φ, cos φ) and F(sin η, −cos η) are determined by (2) and (3). Due to Proposition 11,D↑(F(−sinφ,cosφ))={r→∈V2∣r2cosφ≥r1sinφ},andD↑(F(sinη,−cosη))={r→∈V2∣r1sinη≥r2cosη}.Consider any unit vectorr→fromD↑(F)=D↑(F(−sinφ,cosφ))∩D↑(F(sinη,−cosη)),r→=(cosτ,sinτ).Then necessarilysinτcosφ−cosτsinφ=sin(τ−φ)≥0,andcosτsinη−sinτcosη=sin(η−τ)≥0.Hence, 0 ≤ τ − φ ≤ π and 0 ≤ η − τ ≤ π, which means that φ ≤ τ ≤ π + φ and η − π ≤ τ ≤ η. Now, it is enough to observe that for each vectorr→∈K,it holds that it is a|r→|-multiple of a unit vector characterized by an angle τ ∈ [φ, η]. Note that if η − φ = π, F = F( − sin φ, cos φ). Finally, note that Fd= max {F( − sin φ, cos φ), F(sin η, −cos η)},D↑(Fd)=K.□(i)Consider, e.g.,η=π3andφ=π6. ThenF(−sinφ,cosφ)(x,y)=F(−12,32)(x,y)=−x+3y+11+3,andF(sinη,−cosη)(x,y)=F(32,−12)(x,y)=3x−y+11+3,and finally,F(x,y)=11+3(1−max{x,y}+3min{x,y}).It holds thatD↑(F)={(r1,r2)∈V2∣−r1+3r2≥0∧3r1−r2≥0}.Similarly, forη=3π4andφ=π4we getF(−sinφ,cosφ)(x,y)=F(−12,12)(x,y)=−x+y+12,andF(sinη,−cosη)(x,y)=F(12,12)(x,y)=x+y2,and finally,F(x,y)=12(y+min{x,1−x}).Based on Proposition 12, we have:–forη=π2,φ = 0, i.e., in the first quadrant, F(x, y) = min {x, y};for η = π,φ=π2,i.e., in the second quadrant, F(x, y) = min {1 − x, y};forη=32π,φ = π, i.e., in the third quadrant, F(x, y) = min {1 − x, 1 − y} = 1 − max {x, y};for η = 2π,φ=32π,i.e., in the fourth quadrant, F(x, y) = min {x, 1 − y}.
