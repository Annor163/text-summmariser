Social exchange in online social networks. The reciprocity phenomenon on Facebook

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Our research is focused on reciprocity, which is crucial for social exchanges.The online social network platform of our choice was Facebook, which is one of the most successful online social sites.In our study we found strong empirical evidence that an increase in the number of reciprocity messages the actor broadcasts in online social networks increases the reciprocity reactions from his or her audience.This finding allowed for positive verification of the social exchange theory in online communities.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Social exchange theory proposes that social behavior is the result of an exchange process. The purpose of this exchange is to maximize benefits and minimize costs. Online social networks seem to be an ideal platform for social exchange because they provide an opportunity to keep social relations with a relatively low cost compared to offline relations. This theory was verified positively many times for offline social interactions, and we decided to examine whether this theory may be also applied to online social networks. Our research is focused on reciprocity, which is crucial for social exchanges because humans keep score, assign meaning to exchanges, and change their subsequent interactions based on a reciprocity balance. The online social network platform of our choice was Facebook, which is one of the most successful online social sites allowing users to interact with their friends and acquaintances. In our study we found strong empirical evidence that an increase in the number of reciprocity messages the actor broadcasts in online social networks increases the reciprocity reactions from his or her audience. This finding allowed for positive verification of the social exchange theory in online communities. Hence, it can be stated that our work contributes to theories of exchange patterns in online social networks.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The focus of this paper is on dyadic exchange in online social networks, based on the social exchange theory. One of the core concepts of network exchange theories [29,33] is the primacy of reciprocation. According to this theory, reciprocity is a behavioral response to perceived kindness and unkindness, where kindness comprises both distributional fairness as well as fairness intentions. There is a large body of evidence which indicates that reciprocity is a powerful determinant of human behavior. Experiments and questionnaire studies performed by psychologists and economists, as well as an impressive literature in sociology, ethnology and anthropology, emphasize the omnipresence of reciprocal behavior (see, e.g., [19,27]). In our study, we apply the core concepts of organizational network research [29] to investigate interaction dynamics of long-duration online social networks. Kilduff et al. define a core of key idea that we adopt in this research: the primacy of relationships. We theorize and empirically measure the communication patterns of online social networks using Facebook as a platform for our research.This paper is organized as follows: in the subsequent section we present related works. Section 3 introduces theory description and research hypothesis. Section 4 contains the experimental part, including research settings and the description of variables. Section 5 discusses the regression models and final results. Section 6 concludes and discusses our experimental findings, ending with a short overview of the potential applications.
