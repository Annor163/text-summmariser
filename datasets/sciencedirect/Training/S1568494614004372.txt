@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Network reconfiguration is the process of changing the topology of distribution systems by altering the open/closed status of switches. Because there are many candidate-switching combinations in the distribution system, network reconfiguration is a complicated combinatorial, non-differentiable constrained optimization problem. In addition, the radiality constraint typically increases the intricacy of the problem. In this paper, to avoid create infeasible configuration, a new codification is proposed. The proposed codification is computationally efficient and guarantees to generate only feasible radial topologies all times. Also, in this paper, a modified heuristic approach for optimal reconfiguration in radial distribution systems is presented. Additionally, in order to economize voltage profile improvement, a number of new formulas have been represented.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Distribution networks, which are designed in closed loop and operated in open loop, include a lot of switches on feeder lines. Network reconfiguration is an important functional part of Distribution Management System (DMS), and it also is a main optimization means of distribution automation systems. Under the normal operating conditions, network structure can be reconfigured by changing the open/close status of those sectionalize switches and tie lines to get the objective of reducing power losses, balancing load, improving the voltage profiles and economic efficiency of the distribution electrical networks.In the recent years, with regard to combinatorial nature of the non-liner and discrete network reconfiguration problem and large number of integer and continuous variables, researchers have been encouraged to explore heuristic techniques as they can be easily implemented [1–7].Civanlar [8] developed a branch exchange method. In this method, loss reduction is achieved by exchange operation corresponds to the selection of a pair of switches, one for opening and the other for closing so that the resulting network has lower line losses while remaining connected and radial. The major drawbacks of this method are: (1) The final network reconfiguration is dependent on the initial state of the network switches, (2) Optimum solution is not guaranteed, (3) Selection of each switches exchange operation becomes very time consuming. Guedes et al. [9] proposed a new reconfiguration heuristic in order to reduce the total power losses and the maximum current of electrical radial networks. It is based on the branch-and-bound strategy, which is an implicit enumeration method that uses a tree structure and bounds to organize the searching process. Moshtagh and Ghasemi [10] proposed a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) based approach for distribution system reconfiguration. In contrast to the conventional GA based methods, NSGA-II does not require weighting factors required for conversion of multi-objective function into an equivalent single objective function. Fu-Yuan Hsu [11] proposed non-dominated sorting evolutionary programming in order to solve the multi-objective problems in distribution systems reconfiguration. Gupta et al. [12] presents an efficient method for the multi-objective reconfiguration of radial distribution systems in fuzzy framework using adaptive genetic algorithm.To solve the reconfiguration problem of large-sized or real distribution systems, many researchers have proposed different codification for meta-heuristic techniques to maintain the radiality constraint.In [13], Romero et al., in order to generate radial configuration, proposed a method based on concept called path-to-node. This method consists of identifying paths linking between each bus and substation which is an exhaustive approach. In [14], Delbem et al. using concepts of graph theory, developed an integral proposal to deal with the problem of generating radial topologies efficiently. However in this approach, only the mutation operator was used and the recombination operator was discarded as it usually generates infeasible individuals. In [15], Mendoza et al. used loop vectors to ensure the generation of feasible individuals throughout the genetic evolution. This drastically reduces the search space. However, it will produce infeasible individuals especially while solving the reconfiguration problem of large-sized real distribution network and this method fails to search the isolation of principal interior nodes of the distribution networks and therefore requires mesh checks which is a time consuming approach. Morton and Mareels [16] proposed brute force solution to list and evaluate all feasible radial configurations for a distribution network. The optimal solution was guaranteed, but the method cannot be used for a real distribution network because the number of feasible radial configurations increases exponentially with the increase in the number of distribution feeders. In [17], Abdelaziz et al. presented an algorithm in order to distinguish between feasible and infeasible individuals with the help of bus incidence matrix ‘A’. They suggested that the value of the ‘determinant of A’ is either 0 or ±1 for unfeasible and feasible radial topologies, respectively. If the individual is infeasible the correction algorithm is very exhaustive as it replaces each switch subsequently with all the switches of the network. This algorithm looks very handy but for medium and large-sized distribution networks CPU time will increase directly. In [18], Enacheanu et al. in order to find spanning trees, combined the Kruskal algorithm with the matroid theory. The algorithm generates a chain of spanning trees using branch exchange mechanism.The proposed methods in [14,15] usually generate infeasible topologies. The proposed codification in [16,17] are very time consuming and cannot be used for a real distribution network. However, the proposed codification in this paper guarantees to generate feasible configuration all the time with less computational effort. In addition, the implementation of the proposed codification is simple, quick and precise.The proposed heuristic approach in [19], at each step, calculates the objective function of all possible structure which can be generated from the current feasible structure. Its leads to run so many unnecessary power flows. So, this method is very time consuming especially in case of medium and large scale distribution systems. Additionally, this method often cannot find the global optimum solution. These aforementioned shortcomings can be overcome by changing the manner of selecting the candidate switches for switching which it is accomplished in this paper. In this work, the proposed method in [19] is modified so that the time-consuming to solve network reconfiguration problem in medium and large scale distribution system is obviously reduced. Furthermore, this modified method always reaches to global optimum solution which cannot be handled by method proposed in Ref. [19].The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) present a new codification for distribution network reconfiguration, (ii) present a modified heuristic approach to solve the distribution network reconfiguration problem, (iii) present a number of new formulas to economize voltage profile improvement obtained from distribution network reconfiguration which is always neglected in all previous studies. The proposed method is applied to balanced and unbalanced distribution systems. The results, obtained using the proposed method, are compared with results obtained using other techniques to examine the performance of the proposed method.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the problem formulation. Sections 3 and 4 provide an overview of proposed codification and algorithm, respectively, and describes how these can be applied for the network reconfiguration problem. Section 5 presents simulations results and Section 6 outlines conclusions.The mathematical model of the reconfiguration optimization problem has the following general form:(1)optim{f}Subject to:(2)Vmin≤Vi≤Vmax(3)Ii≤Iimax(4)ψn=0Eq. (1) corresponds to the objective function to be optimized. Eqs. (2) and (3) consider voltage constraints for each node of network and current limit for each branch of network, respectively. Eq. (4) deals with the radial topology constraint (if network is radial, soψ=0, otherwiseψ=1).This paper focuses on losses cost, switching operation cost and cost benefit from voltage profile improvement issues involved with reconfiguration of distribution networks. So, the optimum solution is such configuration which has the minimum losses and switching operation cost and also has the maximum cost benefit from voltage profile improvement. In order to consider these three objectives simultaneously, they must be combined to form a single objective function as described in Eq. (5).Hence, the objective functionfthat should be optimized is:(5)minLC+SWC−CIVQuantitative and qualitative properties of the aforementioned criteria are as follows:The power losses can be identified by several components, of which the most important is given by the technical losses and two of the components can be identified in this category: power losses and energy losses [20]. The active power losses flowing on the line l is:(6)Ploss,l=3RlIl2when Ploss,l, produced in the time interval T, is active power losses through the electrical line l, the energy losses is given by:(7)Wloss,l=Ploss,l×TSo LC for line l is obtained by:(8)LCl=cplPloss,l+cwlWloss,lThen the total losses cost LC for all network branches is:(9)LC=∑lLClOne of the most important issues in distribution network reconfiguration is the number of the switching. The efficient life cycle of the switches is directly depend on the number of their switching and less switching can be caused to extend the life of the switches. To achieve this purpose, which is reducing the number of switchings, one of the simplest procedures is to involve the objective functions with the cost of switching. The result of applying this procedure in the optimization problem under study will be a massive reduction in the number of switchings, which consequently reduces not only operation costs but also maintenance costs.Improving voltage profiles has a lot of advantages: for example it increases power consumption of consumers and the total value of the network. The increase in power consumption of consumers depends on load type of consumers. In general, there are three different types of loads: constant impedance, constant power and constant current. Each type has a certain behavior toward changes in their voltage magnitude. The active power consumption for a three-phase load i is given by:(10)Pi=3Vi,phIi,phcos∅iBelow, it is shown how active power of each load type will be changed due to changes in their voltage amplitude.In the case of a constant impedance load, three-phase active power consumption of lth load at voltage amplitudeV1isP1=3V1I1cosΦ1and at voltageV2=V1+ΔVisP2=3V2I2cos∅2, so:(11)z=VI=constant,I1=V1z,I2=V1+ΔVz⇒I2−I1I1=ΔVV1(12)zisconstant⇒cosϕ2=cosϕ1(13)⇒ΔP=P2−P1=3V2I2−V1I1cosϕ1=3V1+ΔVI2−V1I1cosϕ1=3V1I2−I1+ΔVI2cosϕ1=32ΔVI1+ΔV2V1cosϕ1≈32ΔVI1cosϕ1=2ΔVP1V1cosϕ1cosϕ1=2ΔVV1P1For constant power loads, active power consumption of loads, before and after the change in the voltage amplitude, remain constant; so:(14)ΔP=P2−P1=0For a constant current load, before and after change in the voltage amplitude, the current remains constant; therefore,(15)I2=I1⟶ΔVisverysmallsocosϕ2≈cosϕ1ΔP=P2−P1≈3V2−V1I1cosϕ1=3ΔVI1cosϕ1=ΔVV1P1Where, ΔV is the amount of the voltage improvement. Thus, the cost benefit, due to voltage profile improvement, (CIV) is obtained by:(16)CIV=∑i=1nβγicpPiTDue to operation costs of power systems, a lower rate of increased power consumption of consumers is the cost benefit. So, in Eq. (16), β is used to address this benefit rate γ is coefficient of variation in power consumption of each load type which is2(ΔV/V1)for constant impedance loads, 0 for constant power loads andΔV/V1for constant current loads.cpdis the cost of power.The radial configuration, in which the distribution network operates, should not posses any closed path with all loads energized. Such radial configurations are called trees of the distribution network graph (DNG). Any tree of a DNG with N nodes is composed of (N−1) tree branches. The set of links constitutes co-tree and it is the complement of the tree. The number of links of a DNG is unique and is given by:(17)S=E−N−1Exploring the solution of distribution network reconfiguration problem using some meta-heuristic technique, the initial population may be obtained through the random selection of s number of candidate switches out of all E number of switches of the distribution network. Most of the time, it generates infeasible individuals, particularly in the case of medium or large-sized distribution networks. This certainly leads to increased computational burden to create initial population. In distribution network reconfiguration problem, one of the most important conditions at first is to generate the new configuration which meets both radial and all node energized criteria.In the proposed codification, to avoid create infeasible individuals, some graph theory-based rules have been framed. Before framing these rules, the following terms must be defined:Consider a network with n nodes and m branches and K substation in which:A is matrix of the ordern×1that the elementai1of the matrix A is equal to the number of branches which directly are connected to the ith node (the tie lines are ignored), B is matrix of the ordern×n. The elementbijof the matrix B can be 1 or 0 as defined below:(18)bij=1ifi=jornodiandjbeconnectedtogetherdirectly0otherwiseC is matrix of ordern×n. The elementcijof the matrix C can be 1 or 0 as defined below:(19)cij=1for;j=1,2,…,n;ifnodeiissubstatipon.0forj=1,2,…,n;otherwise(20)Dismatrixofordern×nwhereDi,j=Ci,j×Bni,jIt is assumed that the summation of all elements of matrix A for initial condition (with no loop in network and all nodes energized) and after any changes in switches states of the network are equal to a1 and a2, respectively. Now, for new arrangement of switches, the network remains radial topology and with no any node islanded, as long as all of the following rules are respected:(1)Rule 1: non of A matrix elements must equal to zero.Rule 2: a1=a2.Rule 3: the column summation of D matrix must not have any zero elements.These rules guarantee to prevent producing individuals with infeasible radial topologies. Thus, are necessary to dictate meta-heuristic techniques throughout the evolution processes without involving boring mesh checks.Now, the distribution system in Fig. 1is used to illustrate how the proposed codification works. For initial condition of Fig. 1(1) the A, B, C matrixes anda1are:A=33121331113121′B=1100010000100011110000000000011000000000000101100000000000011000000000100001110000000000011011000000000101000000000000101000000000001001000010000000001110000000000011000000000000101100000000000011C=1111111111111100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a1=26Case 1: In case 1, which is shown in Fig. 1(2), the test system has a loop and this structure does not meet criteria for distribution network operation. According to proposed codification, the rule 2 is not satisfied, because a2=28 and it is not equal to a1. As a result, case 1 has been rejected.Case 2: In Fig. 1(3), case 2 indicates a test system which contains a loop and three islanded nodes. Now let us compute column summation of D matrix for network configuration in case 2.485065036017781559222192161483385232587250271522000439290930546582310487989951As it can be seen, there are three zeros in column summation of D matrix at column 7, 9 and 10. It means that nodes 7, 9 and 10 are islanded. According to proposed codification, rule 3 is not met, as a result this structure can be rejected.With regard to aforementioned cases (cases 1 and 2), this codification can easily recognize the jurisdiction of a structure. This codification is also very easy to be coded in a programming environment. In this paper, this codification is used to determine merit of the new structures established for distribution network reconfiguration.Baran and Wu [19] presented a heuristic algorithm based on the branch exchange. To assist in the search, two approximated load flows for radial networks with different degrees of accuracy are used (simple Dist flow method and back and forward update of Dist. flow method). The algorithm starts with a feasible structure and then creates new ones successively by implementing one branch exchange at a time. At each iteration, the branch exchange is implemented among all the possible structure that can be generated from the current feasible structure by branch exchanges and is chosen the one that improves the objective function the most without any constraint violations. The method is very time consuming due to the complicated combinations in large scale system and converges to a local optimum solution.In this paper, the method presented in [19] has been modified so that it considers only feasible individuals, avoids running power flow in meshed configurations and goes toward which will be caused to improve objective function.First of all, before explaining proposed method for reconfiguration, the terms node-power (np) and tie-line loop (tie-loop) should be explained.In distribution network, based on radial configuration, each node is connected to substation through a specified set of branches. This set of branches is unique for each node. It is assumed that the unique set of branches which connect node i to corresponding substation is Hi.According to Eq. (6), the termRlIl2indicates the power losses through line l which can be rewritten asRl((Pl,k2+Ql,k2)/Vi2)and in the network, Viis close to 1(pu). So, by accepting a little error it can be considered thatRl(Pl,k2+Ql,k2)≈Rl((Pl,k2+Ql,k2)/Vi2). Hence, np(i) is introduced by:(21)np(i)=∑k∈HiRkPl,k2+Ql,k2Therefore, the np(i) indicate the summation of power losses through lines which connect node i to corresponding substation. We found that such node which has the maximum np also has the minimum node voltage and such tie line which has maximum voltage difference between its nodes is in the first priority for switching. In this regards, using node-power difference (Δnptie) to find the tie line with maximum voltage difference between its nodes is more efficient, because evaluating node voltage needs power flow calculation but node-power is calculated without any power flow calculation. Therefore, it helps method to reach final solution in less time.Tie-line loop (tie-loop) for each tie line in the network is a set of lines which, if the tie-line is closed, forms a loop.For example, see Fig. 1(1), the node-power of node 3 is:np(3)=∑k∈H3Rk(Pl,k2+Ql,k2)where H3={s1, s2} and the tie-loop vector related to tie line “s15” is: tie-loop (s15)=[s5, s7, s15, s11, s10].The overall representation of the proposed methodology for reconfiguration of distribution network in this paper is presented by a flow chart which depicted in Fig. 2.To apply the proposed algorithm in the distribution network reconfiguration, the following steps should be repeated:Step 1: Define the input data: In this step, the input data including the network configuration, lines and loads data, the tie lines (tie-lines vector), tie-loop for each tie line, number of tie lines (Ntie), discarded tie-lines vector (DTV=∅Ntie×1) and put k=0 (“k” is a counter).Step 2: Evaluating of objective function (f1): in this step the value of the objective function is evaluated using results of the power flow based on the existing tie lines (tie-lines).Step 3: ComputingΔnp: The node-power difference([Δnptie],fortie=1,2,…,Ntie)across all of the open tie lines (tie-lines) are computed.Step 4: If k=Ntie, then finish the algorithm and print the value of objective function (f1) and the tie lines vector (tie-lines), otherwise go to step 5.Step 5: The node-power difference(Δnptie)across such open tie lines which belong to DTV are ignored.Step 6: Switching operation: such open tie line which has the maximum node-power difference in vectorΔnptieis detected and considered first. Also one ends of nodes of this tie line is detected that has the highest np. The status of switches of both sides of this node must be changed. The detected tie line is changed in to closed and its neighbor line in corresponding tie-loop will change to open and create the new arrangement of tie lines (tie-lines-new).Step 7: Constrains checking: in this step, the constraints related to nodes voltage, branches current and radiality constraint of network are checked. If any constraint is violated, then k=k+1 and such tie line which is selected to switching operation (in step 6), add to DTV vector and return to step 4, otherwise go to step 8.Step 8: Evaluating of objective function (f2): in this step the new value of the objective function (f2) is evaluated using results of the power flow based on the new status of tie lines (tie-lines-new). If f2≤f1, then go to step 9, otherwise k=k+1 and such tie line which is selected to switching operation (in step 6), add to DTV vector and return to step 4.Step 9: In this step, the switching operation is accepted (tie-lines←tie-lines-new), all members of DTV vector are cleared (DTV=∅Ntie×1), k=0, f1=f2 and go to step 3.In step 7, the state electrical quantities assigned to the nodes (voltages) and branches (currents) are obtained through a load flow calculation, by applying the improved BW/FW sweep method [21] which has formulated for single phase balanced and three-phase unbalanced radially operated networks and in order to check the radiality constraint, the proposed codification is employed. The flow chart of the proposed method is presented in Fig. 3.The proposed method is programmed in MATLAB on a PC Pentium IV, 2.8-GHz computer with 512 MB of RAM.In order to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of proposed method, it is tested on a 33-bus distribution system [19], a 69-bus distribution system [22], a 86-bus radial distribution system [23], a 119-bus distribution system [24] and a 33-bus unbalanced distribution system [25]. In order to show the dependence of proposed method to initial configuration of the network, the modified 33-bus distribution system (I) [26] is considered. In this case, the initial configuration of the 33-bus distribution network [19] has been changed by closing tie-lines 33 and 37 and opening the sectionalize branch 3 and 6. Additionally, in order to show the robustness of the proposed algorithm to the changes of the quantities of loads, the modified 33-bus distribution network (II) [26] is considered. In this case the loads at node 9 (60kW and 20kVAR) and the loads at node 13 (120kW and 80kVAR) were both changed to 420kW and 200kVAR. The initial configuration, system rated voltage, real power loss and minimum node voltage of these test distribution systems are summarized in Table 1.By performing the initial load flow in the 33-bus, 69-bus, 86-bus, 119-bus, modified 33-bus (I), Modified 33-bus (I) and 33-bus unbalanced distribution test systems, it is observed that the total real power losses of these systems is 202.68, 224.93, 531.99, 1301.9, 197.22, 299.94 and 207.82kW, respectively, and the maximum voltage drop of these systems is 8.7%, 9.1%, 5.2%, 12.17%, 7.88%, 12.86% and 10%, respectively. Considering these values of power losses and the fact that the maximum voltage drop is not within the permitted limit, the desirable systems require reconfiguration. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is applied to reduce power losses and improve the voltage profiles of these test systems.Tables 2 and 3present comparison of the optimal results obtained for these aforementioned test distribution systems using proposed method with other heuristic and meta-heuristic techniques available in the literature.It can be observed from results of 33, 69, 86 and 119-bus systems (Table 2) that the proposed method is the best in the solution as well as the CPU time. In the most of meta-heuristic algorithms, creation of infeasible individuals leads to increased computational time, while in this paper, the proposed codification avoids to creation of infeasible solutions. Thus, the computation time of the proposed method is less than the other methods. This clearly shows the computation efficiency of the proposed method for small, medium and large-scale distribution systems.From Table 3 it can be seen that the optimal configuration for modified 33-bus (I) is obtained by opening the switches 7, 14, 9, 32 and 37, which causes a power loss of 136.57kW and for modified 33-bus (II) is obtained by opening the switches 9, 14, 32, 28 and 33, which causes a power loss of 198.11kW and for 33-bus unbalanced distribution system is obtained by opening the switches 7, 9, 14, 37 and 32, which causes a power loss of 142.71kW.For the modified 33-bus (I) in comparison with Refs. [39–41] same results are obtained, but in comparison with Ref. [26], the proposed algorithm has reached to better results. For the modified 33-bus (II), the results obtained by proposed algorithm are better that the results obtained by the other methods which presented in Refs. [26,39–41]. Also, the results obtained by proposed method for the 33-bus unbalanced system are better than results obtained in Ref. [25]. It should be noted that, in whole above mentioned cases, The CPU time taken by the proposed method is less than other methods.Table 3 clearly shows that the proposed algorithm does not depend on the initial switching configuration and even for a bad initial configuration which has high losses, reaches to optimal configuration.In order to test the proposed method, based on economic discussion, it is applied on the modified 119-bus radial distribution system. Each consumer represented by a combination of constant impedance, constant power and constant current load which share of each load type is 40%, 40% and 20%, respectively. The study period T is 24h in which three different load levels that is light load, normal load and heavy load are 8, 10, and 6h a day, respectively. The active and reactive powers of the consumption nodes for light, normal and heavy load levels are 80%, 100% and 120% of active and reactive powers of the consumption nodes of 119-bus radial distribution system loads in Ref. [24], respectively.To evaluate the cost of the losses and the cost of benefits from voltage profiles improvement, the values are:Cpl=10 €/kW, Cwl=0.6 €/kWh, Cp=8 €/kWh, β=0.6 and a switching cost for each pair of switching operations is € 9.00.Table 4shows the results obtained using the proposed method. It can be depicted from Table 4 that after reconfiguration based on LC criterion minimization, the losses cost reduction is 31.97%, CIV is € 35483.7 and minimum node voltage is 0.9173pu. The losses cost reduction, CIV and minimum node voltage of network after reconfiguration based on LC+SWC−CIV criterion minimization are 33.35%, € 39160.9 and 0.9175pu, respectively. These results show that considering cost benefit from voltage profile improvement (CIV) leads to better solution in all losses cost reduction, voltage profile improvement and cost benefit from voltage profile improvement items.Moreover, computational runtime is reduced when the CIV criterion is considered in reconfiguration process.From Table 4 it can be seen that considering the cost benefit from voltage profiles improvement in reconfiguration process can be important as losses cost reduction and considering both LC and CIV criteria simultaneously leads to better solution.
