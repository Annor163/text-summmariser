@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The research on financial portfolio optimization has been originally developed by Markowitz (1952). It has been further extended in many directions, among them the portfolio insurance theory introduced by Leland and Rubinstein (1976) for the “Option Based Portfolio Insurance” (OBPI) and Perold (1986) for the “Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance” method (CPPI). The recent financial crisis has dramatically emphasized the interest of such portfolio strategies. This paper examines the CPPI method when the multiple is allowed to vary over time. To control the risk of such portfolio management, a quantile approach is introduced together with expected shortfall criteria. In this framework, we provide explicit upper bounds on the multiple as function of past asset returns and volatilities. These values can be statistically estimated from financial data, using for example ARCH type models. We show how the multiple can be chosen in order to satisfy the guarantee condition, at a given level of probability and for various financial market conditions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Portfolio selection theory has been originally introduced by Markowitz (1952) and further developed in many directions (see e.g. Merton (1971, 1990), for the continuous-time setting). Various decision criteria such as the expected utility theory can be considered to determine the optimal portfolios (see e.g. Campbell & Viceira, 2002; Prigent, 2007; Yu, Pang, Troutt, & Hou, 2009). The impact of portfolio rebalancing methods has been also investigated (see e.g. Detemple, Garcia, & Rindishbacher, 2003; Wang & Forsyth, 2011; Yu & Lee, 2011). However, investors often search for additional guarantees (portfolio insurance), in particular when financial markets drop. The financial management industry extensively uses portfolio insurance methods for various financial instruments: equities, bonds, structured credit products, hedge funds, etc.Portfolio insurance has two main objectives: first, to allow investors to recover at maturity at least a given percentage of their initial investments (usually 100%); second, to benefit from potential financial market rises. Thus, it allows investors to limit downside risk in bearish financial markets, second to get significant portfolio returns in bullish markets. Such portfolio management is dramatically relevant during financial crises. The two main portfolio insurance methods are: the Option Based Portfolio Insurance (OBPI), introduced by Leland and Rubinstein (1976); the Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) considered by Perold (1986) for fixed-income instruments and Black and Jones (1987) for equity instruments (see also Perold & Sharpe, 1988). As regards OBPI method, the portfolio is invested in a risky benchmark asset covered by a put option written on it. The strike of the option is equal to a fixed proportion of the initially invested amount (which corresponds to the capital insured at maturity).The CPPI method is based on a dynamic portfolio allocation along the whole management period. The investor determines a floor which is defined as the lowest acceptable portfolio value. Then, she invests an amount (“the exposure”) in the risky asset, which corresponds to a given proportion (called “the multiple”) of the excess of the portfolio value over the floor (this difference is usually called “the cushion”). The remaining funds are usually invested in cash (treasury-bills for example). Both the management parameters (floor and multiple) depend on the investor’s risk tolerance. The CPPI strategy implies that the exposure is about zero if the cushion value is near zero. In continuous-time, this property prevents portfolio value from falling below the floor, except if a very sharp drop in the market occurs before the investor can modify her portfolio allocation. Some of the properties of portfolio insurance have been previously studied by Black and Rouhani (1989) and Black and Perold (1992) when the risky asset follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and by Bertrand and Prigent (2003) when the volatility is stochastic. Comparisons between standard portfolio insurance methods are illustrated by Bookstaber and Langsam (2000), Cesari and Cremonini (2003) and Bertrand and Prigent (2005, 2011). The main conclusion is that it is not so easy to rank these strategies, except by their sensitivity Vega to the volatility of the risky asset. However, the CPPI method is the best strategy when the market drops or increases by a significant amount.1Note also that, using various stochastic dominance (SD) criteria up to third order and assuming that the risky underlying asset follows a GBM, Zagst and Kraus (2011) provide very specific parameter conditions implying the second- and third-order SD of the CPPI strategy.1The main issue of the CPPI strategy is to choose the crucial parameter which determines the portfolio risk exposure, known as the multiple (denoted by m). Note that financial institutions directly bear the risk of the insured portfolios they sell: at maturity, if the portfolio value is smaller than the guaranteed floor (“the gap risk”), they must compensate the corresponding loss with their own capitals. Thus, one crucial question for the financial institution that promotes such funds is: what exposure to the risky asset or, equivalently, what level of the multiple m to accept? On the one hand, since the portfolio expected return is increasing with respect to the multiple m, customers want the multiple as high as possible. On the other hand, due to market imperfections,2For example, portfolio managers cannot actually rebalance portfolios in continuous time.2portfolio managers must control the gap risk by setting the multiple m smaller than an upper bound. If a maximal daily historical drop (e.g.-20%) is anticipated during the time period, the portfolio manager choosesm⩽5.3See Proposition 1 for details about determination of this upper bound.3It implies low expected portfolio returns. If the risky asset drop is assumed to be less significant (e.g.-10%), the upper bound can be chosen higher (e.g.m⩽10). If the portfolio manager wants to use higher multiple values, she can base the strategy on quantile hedging. In that case, the multiple can be chosen as high as possible but so that the portfolio value will always be above the floor at a given probability level (typically 99%).The answer to this latter issue has important practical implications. However, the usual assumption in the literature is that the multiple is constant through time. It implies that: it has to be determined initially; it is unconditional, meaning that, whatever the market and portfolio value fluctuations, the risk exposure is always equal to the same proportion of the cushion. Thus, such portfolio strategy does not take sufficiently account of the possibility that the risky asset drops, which challenges the concept of dynamic portfolio insurance. In a discrete-time setting, the extreme value approach has been applied to the standard CPPI method with constant multiple by Bertrand and Prigent (2002) to control the gap risk. Balder, Brandl, and Mahayni (2009) have analyzed CPPI effectiveness using quantile conditions when the risky asset follows a GBM that is discretized at deterministic times. Cont and Tankov (2009) have examined CPPI strategies for exponential Lévy processes. But all these unconditional methods reduce the risk exposure to a constant risky asset exposure, which cannot be dynamically adjusted.In this paper, we introduce another CPPI method, directly linked to a risk management approach and based on a conditional multiple. In this setting, we determine upper bounds on the conditional time-varying multiple, using both quantile (“Value-at-Risk”) and expected shortfall criteria to control gap risks. Such downside risk measures have been introduced in the late nineties and further analyzed (see e.g. Pedersen & Satchell, 1998; Artzner, Delbaen, Eber, & Heath, 1999; Szegö, 2002). They are related to economical capital allocation as recommended by Basel II for banking laws and regulations (see Goovaerts, Kaas, & Dhaene, 2002). They have also been also intensively used in portfolio management (see Rockafellar & Uryasev, 2002). Unlike Hamidi, Jurczenko, and Maillet (2009) and Hamidi, Maillet, and Prigent (2009) who use conditional autoregressive Value-at-Risk to estimate gap risks, we consider a quite general parametric model based on Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroscedastic (ARCH) type return modelling. In this framework, we succeed in identifying exactly the various upper bounds. Our results prove that a conditional multiple can be determined as functions of state variables. These latter ones are usually the past stock logreturns and volatilities.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic properties of the CPPI model. Section 3 introduces the modified CPPI method with a conditional multiple, based on various quantile and expected shortfall conditions. In particular, upper bounds on the multiple are provided and analyzed. Section 4 illustrates numerically the previous theoretical results and provides a detailed description of the portfolio return distributions. Some of the proofs are gathered in Appendix.Basically, two assets are involved: the riskless asset, B, with deterministic rates (usually Treasury bills or other liquid money market instruments) and the risky one, S (usually a market index, equity index for instance). Changes in asset prices are supposed to occur at discrete times(tk)1⩽k⩽nalong a whole management period[0,T].The riskless asset evolves according to deterministic rates4Note that, since the rebalancing frequencies(tk-tk-1)are usually small, the standard levels ofrtkhave no significant impact on the numerical values of the upper bounds provided in what follows. Additionally, if the interest rate is stochastic, it is mainly its mean that determines the floor: For instance, consider a guaranteed percentage equal to 100% and a time horizon equal to 8years. Then, if the mean of the interest rate is equal to 2% (resp. 3%), the initial floor value is equal to about 15% (resp. 21%) of the initial portfolio value (see details below in Section 2.2).4denoted byrtkfor the time periods[tk-1,tk](it means thatBtk=Btk-1(1+rtk)). The variations of the stock price S between two timestk-1andtkare defined by:ΔStk=Stk-Stk-1.Since we search an upper bound on the multiple m, we have to focus on the left hand side of the probability distribution ofΔStkStk-1. Thus, we introduce the following notation:Xtk=-ΔStkStk-1=Stk-1-StkStk-1,whereXtkdenotes the opposite of the relative jump of the risky asset at timetk. In fact, when we want to determine an upper bound on the multiple m, we have only to consider positive values of X.Denote byMT, the maximum of the finite sequence(Xtk)1⩽k⩽n. We have:(1)MT=Max(Xt1,…,Xtn).Usually, the individual, having initially invested an amountV0, wants to recover a fixed percentage p ofV0at a given maturity T. To provide a terminal portfolio valueVThigher than the insured amountpV0, the portfolio manager keeps the portfolio valueVtkabove the floorFtk=Ftk-1e-rtk(tk-tk-1)at any timetkduring the management period0,Tand withF0=p·V0·e-∑rtk(tk-tk-1)(for fixed interest ratesrtk=r, we get:F0=p·V0·e-rT). For this purpose, she determines:•The deterministic floorFtkwhich must be lower than the portfolio valueVtkat any timetk. Note that the floor evolves as the riskless asset (same deterministic ratesrtk).The amountetk(also called the exposure) invested in the risky asset, which is a fixed proportion m of the cushionCtkthat is the excess of the portfolio value over the floor.The constant m, called the multiple, which is a nonnegative constant. Taking account of both search for performance (m must be sufficiently high) and risk control (m must be not too high), usual values of constant multiple lie between 3 and 10.5See Prigent (2001) for an explanation of the lower bound and Proposition 1 for the upper bound.5For example, settingV0=100,F0=85, andm=4means that the amount initially invested on the risky asset is equal toe0=4×(100-85)=60.The remaining fund(Vtk-etk)is invested in the riskless asset with a deterministic ratertkfor the period[tk-1,tk]. SinceCtk=Vtk-Ftk, this insurance method consists in keepingCtkpositive at any timetkduring the management period.Both the floor and the multiple are functions of the investor’s risk tolerance. The higher the multiple m, the higher the amount invested on the risky asset. Therefore, the higher the multiple, the more the investor will benefit from increases in stock prices. Thus, a speculative investor would choose high values for m. Nevertheless, the higher the multiple, the faster the portfolio will approach the floor when there is a sustained decrease in stock prices. As the cushion approaches zero, exposure approaches zero, too. In continuous-time, when there is no jump in asset dynamics, this keeps portfolio value from falling below the floor. Nevertheless, during financial crises, a very sharp drop in the market may occur before the manager has a chance to trade. This implies that m must not be too high (for example, if a fall of 10% occurs, m must not be greater than 10 in order to keep the cushion positive).From previous assumptions about portfolio strategies, we deduce that the portfolio value is solution of(2)Vtk=Vtk-1-etk-1Xtk+(Vtk-1-etk-1)rtk.Note thatVtk-Vtk-1=[Ctk-Ctk-1]+[Ftk-Ftk-1]. Therefore, since the floor has the same dynamics as the riskless asset, we deduce the cushion dynamics6We do not take account of transaction costs in order to simplify the exposition of the main results. However, usual proportional transaction costs on liquid assets such as equity indices are rather small (e.g. equal to 0.1%). As shown for instance in Mkaouar and Prigent (2010), proportional transaction costs smaller or equal to 0.1% have relatively weak impact on portfolio returns, especially for weekly or monthly rebalancing time (even for a shorter time period corresponding to two days). Furthermore, the main objective of the paper is to compare CPPI with and without conditional multiples, for which transaction costs are quite similar.6:(3)Ctk=Ctk-1[1-mXtk+(1-m)rtk].Since, for all datestk, the cushion must be positive, we finally get the condition: for allk⩽n,-mXtk+(1-m)rtk⩾-1.In fact, sincertkis relatively small, the previous inequality yields to the following relation that gives an upper bound on the multiple:Proposition 1The guarantee is satisfied at any time of the management period with a probability equal to 1 if and only if∀k⩽n,Xtk⩽1morequivalentlyMT=Max(Xtk)k⩽n⩽1m.If the right end point d of the common distribution F of the variablesXtkis positive, we deduce that the insurance is perfect along any period[0,T]if and only if m is smaller than1d. For example, if the maximal drop is equal to 20%, thend=0.2. Thus m must be less than 5.The previous condition, which is rather strong, can be modified if a quantile hedging approach is adopted, like for the Value-at-Risk (see Föllmer & Leukert (1999) for application of this notion in financial modelling). For example, the new condition is to guarantee that the portfolio value will be always above the floor at a given probability level1-∊. This gives the following relation for a period[0,T]:P[Ctk⩾0,∀tk∈[0,T]]⩾1-∊,or, equivalently, ifMTdenotes the maximum of theXtkfor timestkin[0,T]:(4)P∀tk∈[0,T],Xtk⩽1m=PMT⩽1m⩾1-∊.Note that, since m is nonnegative, the conditionXtk⩽1mis equivalent to[XtkI{0⩽Xtk}]⩽1m. It means that this condition is stringent only when the risky return drops.Then we can detail the quantile hedging condition. For this, introduce the functionFMT-1defined as the inverse of the distribution functionFMTwhich is assumed to be strictly increasing. Then, we get (see Prigent, 2001):Proposition 2For smallrtk, we have (approximately) the following condition:(5)m⩽1FMT-1((1-∊)).Additionally, if the sequence(Xk)kis i.i.d. with common cdf F, then we have:(6)m⩽1F-1(1-∊)1T.This condition gives an upper limit on the multiple m which is obviously higher than the standard limit1d.The simplicity and flexibility of the CPPI method allows the introduction of several extensions:•First, we can introduce a stochastic floor, in particular to keep past profits from rises in the stock market. For example, Estep and Kritzman (1988) have introduced the Time Invariant Portfolio Protection (TIPP). This method is based on the following guarantee condition:(7)Vtk⩾g×maxFtk,supl⩽kVtl,where g is an exogenous parameter which lies between 0 and 1. In this case, the investor does not want to lose more than a given percentage of the maximum of her past portfolio values. This strategy is of CPPI type but with a stochastic floor, given byg×maxFtk,supl⩽kVtl.Second, the multiple can be no longer fixed but determined from market and portfolio dynamics:For instance, Prigent (2001)7As shown in Prigent (2001, 2007), any portfolio insurance method can be associated to a dynamic multiple, which is simply equal to the ratio “exposure/cushion” (for the standard CPPI method, this ratio is constant). However, it is important to rely on the choice of a class of dynamic multiples to specific decision criteria. For the GBM case, using expected utility criterion and specific assumptions, Leland (1980) and Brennan and Solanki (1981) show that the optimal portfolio value is equal to the sum of the floor and a call written on the risky asset. Thus, as shown in Bertrand and Prigent (2005), we get a variable multiple equal to the ratio of the risky asset value times the Delta of the call upon the call value (see also Lee, Chiang, & Hsu, 2008, for other similar approach). Here, we determine the conditional multiple first by using risk measures to control gap risk and second by assuming no longer independent returns.7introduces a more general exposure functione(t,C)defined on[0,T]×R+, positive and continuous.This new exposure e has the following form:(8)etk=e(tk,Ctk).Then, conditions one(tk,Ctk)must be imposed such that the cushion always is positive.(1)If the cushion is nil, then the exposure must be equal to 0:e(tk,0)=0.If the relative sizes of jumpsΔSShave a lower bound d (negative), then, for any(tk,Ctk), we must have:e(tk,Ctk)⩽-1dCtk.In what follows, we examine the problem of the determination of a conditional multiple, using a quantile condition. To illustrate our approach, we assume that the risky asset logreturn follows an ARCH type model.We allow now the CPPI multiple to vary at timestk. Therefore, we consider a sequence of multiple values(mtk)k. The multiple is assumed to be constant (equal tomtk-1) on the time period[tk-1,tk[. Our purpose is to provide explicit conditions on the sequence of multiples(mtk)kto control the gap risk. This later one can induce failure at the level of CPPI strategy: indeed, after a sharp drop in the risky asset price S, the portfolio value can break through the floor so that the cushion becomes negative. This risk can be controlled by adjusting the multiple value by means of a quantile criterion corresponding to a Value-at-Risk approach. Most of previous studies introduce a standard geometric Brownian motion to model the risky asset dynamics. Although this process is widely used in financial theory, it does not take account of potential jumps nor any temporal dependence of financial returns. Portfolio rebalancing is also assumed to be in continuous-time, which is not exactly the usual practice. To overcome these drawbacks, it is possible to use discrete-time processes such as the huge family of ARCH models that particularly take the dependence between returns into account.To control the gap risk of the CPPI portfolio for any time period[tk-1,tk[, we introduce a sequence of positive thresholds(Ltk-1)kfor potential downside cushion values. The idea is to control various probabilities that the cushions become smaller than the thresholds. Since the CPPI strategy implies that the cushion must be nonnegative at any timetk-1, then the thresholdsLtk-1must also be positive. In any case, conditionCtk>Ltk-1implies the usual guarantee constraintCtk>0.Remark 3Choice of the thresholdsThe value of the thresholdLtk-1at timetk-1can depend on the risk tolerance of the investor or be imposed by specific guarantee constraints. For example, we can set:(1)Ltk-1=0. It corresponds to the standard insurance constraint:Ctk>0, which means that the portfolio value must be above the floor.Ltk-1=Lconstant. We can choose for example a constant value for L as a given proportion of the initial cushionL=qCt0.8In practice, CPPI strategies are defined for an average period of 5years. Then, if we choose this threshold L at the beginning of the period, it may be too restrictive or obsolete thereafter.8Ltk-1=qCtk-1, where q is a fixed proportion of the cushion values. In that case, we search to getCtk>qCtk-1. Therefore, the threshold is adjusted to the value of the cushion at any timetk-1. Settingq>1orq<1depends of risk tolerance.A first global quantile condition is defined by:(9)P[∀tk,Ctk>Ltk-1]⩾1-∊.This condition can be deduced from other mild assumptions:1.Assumption (A1):∀k,P[Ctk>Ltk-1|Ct1>Lt0,…,Ctk-1>Ltk-2]⩾(1-∊)1/T.Assumption (A2):∀k,PFtk-1[Ctk>Ltk-1]⩾(1-∊)1/T.Assumption (A3):∀k,PGtk-1[Ctk>Ltk-1]⩾(1-∊)1/T,whereFtk-1denotes theσ-algebra generated by the random variablesXt1,…,XtkandGtk-1is theσ-algebra generated byFtk-1and the random event{Ctk-1>0}.9Note thatGtk-1is theσ-algebra corresponding to the traceσ-algebra ofFtk-1(also called the inducedσ-algebra) on the subsetCtk-1>0(see Schilling, 2005). Additionally, since hereCtk-1>0belongs toFtk-1,Gtk-1is equal to the family of all subsets ofFtk-1contained inCtk-1>0.9Recall thatGtk-1is defined as the smallestσ-algebra that contains all intersections of any subset ofFtk-1with the event{Ctk-1>0}.Proposition 4Each of these three assumptions impliesProperty 9(see Proof inAppendix A).In what follows, we focus on Condition(A3):PGtk-1[Ctk>Ltk-1]⩾(1-∊)1/T. Since we consider small time periods (for example, daily rebalancing), we can assume to simplify thatrtk=0when searching for bounds on the multiple. Recall that the cushion value is determined from the following relation:(10)Ctk=Ctk-1×(1-mtk-1×Xtk).The guarantee condition at any timetkis:Ctk>Ltk-1.Case 1:(Ctk-1>0)Ctk>Ltk-1⇔1-mtk-1×Xtk>Ltk-1Ctk-1.(Ctk-1<0).Note that, in this latter case, we must stop the investment on the risky asset according to regulation of such financial products.10Such rule is introduced to prevent financial institutions which manage CPPI products to take too much risk.10Therefore, for all the remaining time periods, the whole portfolio value is invested on the riskless asset. Thus, at any timetk-1, the value of the multiplemtk-1must be chosen such that, at timetk, the cushion value satisfiesCtk>Ltk-1according to some risk control criterion. Consequently,mtk-1can be searched as the following function:(11)mtk-1=gtk-1×ICtk-1>0+htk-1×ICtk-1⩽0,where bothgtk-1andhtk-1are random variables which areFtk-1-measurable. Since we must stop the investment on the risky asset as soon as the cushion is null, we must sethtk-1=0.In what follows, we search for explicit forms of the random variablesgtk-1. We assume that the risky asset logreturn Y follows a AR-GARCH model. As it is well-known (see e.g. Gourieroux, 1997), this kind of dynamic is quite suitable for describing asset fluctuations in a discrete-time setting. The ARCH models, introduced by Engle (1982), are specific non-linear time series models. They can describe quite exhaustive sets of the underlying dynamics. They have been largely applied on macroeconomics and statistical theory.The GARCH model is defined as follows. The logreturn Y is defined by:Ytk=lnStkStk-1⇔Stk-Stk-1Stk-1=exp(Ytk)-1.Consider the system of auto regressive equations:(12)Ytk=α0+∑i=1pαi×Ytk-i+σtk×εtk,Λ(σtk)=c0+∑j=1qcj(εtk-j)+d1Λ(σtk-1),whereσtkdenotes the volatility, the sequence(εtk)kis i.i.d. with common pdffε>0having supportRandΛ,c0andd1are constant, andcj(·)are deterministic functions.11Note that, forΛ(x)=cj(x)=x2, we recover the standard AR(p)-GARCH(q,1).11The functionΛ:R+→Ris assumed to be strictly increasing. Note that the volatilityσtkis known at timetk-1. It means that the sequence(σtk)kis predictable.The information delivered by the observation of risk asset returns until timetk-1is generated by the random vector(εt1,…,εtk-1).We have:(13)Ftk-1=σ-algebra(εt1,…,εtk-1).Thus, the random variablesgtk-1are deterministic functions of(εt1,…,εtk-1). Therefore, we have to search for multiplesmtk-1which have the following form:mtk-1=g(tk-1,Yt1,…,Ytk-1,σt1,…,σtk)×ICtk-1>0.Remark 5Note also that the random variablesYtk-1are deterministic functions of random vectors(εt1,…,εtk-1). But, for a better financial interpretation of the multiple, we explicitly introduce functions of vectors(Yt1,…,Ytk-1)themselves. Indeed, we examine how the conditional multiple depends on both the volatility levels and on the past logreturns according to given criteria based on specific risk measures. These two kinds of variables are hereIn order to determine the conditional multiple, three cases have to be distinguished:•The cushion at timetk-1satisfies:Ctk-1>Ltk-1(>0).The cushion at timetk-1satisfies:0<Ctk-1<Ltk-1.The cushion at timetk-1is non-positive:Ctk-1<0(in that case, we do no longer invest on the risky asset until the maturity).Denote:(14)Ztk-1=α0+∑i=1Pαi×Ytk-i+σtk×F-1(α),where F denotes the common cdf ofεtkand withα=1-(1-∊)1T.12If we assume as usual that the pdf of the random variablesεis strictly positive, then the cdf F is invertible. Otherwise, we can consider the generalized inverse for monotone functions.12Note thatF-1(α)is a particular value of the random variableεk, since it is its quantile at the levelα. Therefore, for small values ofα(e.g.α=1%),F-1(α)is negative since the valueF-1(α)of the innovationεtkcorresponds to a significant drop of the risky asset (see the Gaussian example). It implies that the logreturn valueZtk-1is a decreasing function with respect to the volatilityσtk.We get the following result (see proof in Appendix B).Proposition 6The quantile condition (A3) at timetk-1can be satisfied according to the following conditions:– Case 1:Ctk-1>Ltk-1:– (1-1)If, at timetk-1, the exposure is smaller than the spread between the cushion and the threshold (i.e.mtk-1Ctk-1<Ctk-1-Ltk-1), thenPGtk-1[Ctk>Ltk-1]=1.It means that if the cushion at timetk-1is relatively high, and if the investor chooses a multiple that is not too high, then her portfolio is always guaranteed against market fluctuations.If, at timetk-1, the exposure is higher than the spread between the cushion and the threshold (i.e.mtk-1Ctk-1>Ctk-1-Ltk-1),13Note that this condition is satisfied as soon asLtk-1>0. Indeed, it implies thatLtk-1Ctk-1-1⩾-1and, sincemtk-1>1, we getmtk-1Ctk-1>Ctk-1-Ltk-1.13then:– (1-2-i)IfZtk-1<0, the conditional multiple must satisfy:(15)mtk-1⩽Ltk-1Ctk-1-1exp[Ztk-1]-1.IfZtk-1>0, there is no constraint formtk-1(recall that we takemtk-1>0).If the investor wants to use a higher multiple then this one must be smaller than a given upper bound if logreturn valueZtk-1is negative (condition 1-2-i: “bear market”). If the marker is rather bullish (condition 1-2-ii), then the multiple is not bounded.(0<)Ctk-1<Ltk-1: then– (2-i)IfZtk-1<0, there is no solution formtk-1. In that case, we stop the investment on the risky asset.IfZtk-1>0, the conditional multiple must satisfy:(16)mtk-1>Ltk-1Ctk-1-1exp[Ztk-1]-1.Here, since the cushion value at timetk-1is relatively small, the multiple must be sufficiently high in order to get a cushion higher than the threshold at timetk.If the investor chooses thresholdsLtk-1proportional toCtk-1(i.e.Ltk-1=qCtk-1) withq<1then case 2 cannot happen.ForLtk-1=0, the quantile condition (A3) at timetk-1is characterized by:- If condition (1-1)-1mtk-1+1<0is met, thenPGtk-1[Ctk>Ltk-1]=1. But this condition means that the multiple is smaller than 1, which is not appropriate if the investor wants to benefit from market rises.14As proved by Perold (1986) for the GBM case, the CPPI portfolio valueVTCPPIat maturity is given by:VTCPPI=pV0+ηTSTm,whereηTis a constant depending on financial and management parameters but not on risky asset valuesST. Therefore, if the multiple m is smaller than1,VTCPPIis a concave function ofST. Consequently, this strategy cannot benefit from significant market rises (for high values ofST, it performs less than the standard buy-and-hold strategy which is just a linear function ofST). As emphasized by Leland and Rubinstein (1976), an insurance portfolio profileVTmust be a convex function ofST. Here, it is equivalent to conditionm>1.14(i)If condition (1-2)-1mtk-1+1>0is met, then:IfZtk-1<0(condition 1-2-i), the multiple must be upper bounded:(17)mtk-1⩽11-exp[Ztk-1].IfZtk-1>0(condition 1-2-ii), then there is no constraint onmtk-1.The previous result shows that, if at time tk−1, the auto regressive termα0+∑i=1Pαi×Ytk-iis sufficiently high (good past performances of the risky asset) and the conditional volatilityσtkis sufficiently small (relatively small volatility risk for the period[tk-1;tk]), then the logreturnYtkhas a high probability to be positive. Thus there is no constraint on the multiple at timetk-1.15Note thatF-1(1-(1-∊)1/T)is a particular value of the random variable∊k(since it is the quantile at the level(1-(1-∊)1/T)).15When the cushion is positive at timetk-1, the choice of the multiple is very flexible. Thus, within the quantile condition at timetk-1, we can add some other conditions on the multiple to benefit better from market conditions. When the cushion is negative (which happens with a small probability), the quantile condition generally cannot be satisfied, except for small values of(1-∊). But, in this case, this is not a true insurance condition. Therefore, a possible strategy is to adopt the previous condition when the cushion is positive and to invest the whole portfolio value on the riskless asset, as soon as the cushion is negative.In what follows, we consider several expected shortfalls (ES) criteria under the dependence logreturn condition. Note that Balder et al. (2009) examine expected shortfall criterion but they only consider the case with i.i.d. Gaussian logreturns and fixed multiple m (see also Cont & Tankov (2009), for i.i.d. Lévy logreturns and also fixed multiple m). The quantile measure (VaR criterion) is the maximum loss not exceeded with a given probability defined at the confidence levelα. A major drawback of the quantile approach is that it does not provide any information about the severity of losses exceeding the quantile value. Therefore, the expected shortfall (also called “Conditional Value-at-Risk”) can be an alternative which better takes account of the average loss beyond the quantile value.Three possible criteria based on ES condition can be considered depending on the information level (recall thatGtk-1is theσ-algebra generated byFtk-1and the random event{Ctk-1>0}):– Criterion B1:minmtk-1E[Ltk-1-Ctk|Ftk-1∩Ctk-1>0];minmtk-1E[Ltk-1-Ctk|Ftk-1∩Ctk<Ltk-1];minmtk-1E[Ltk-1-Ctk|Gtk-1∩Ctk<Ltk-1].However, the first two criteria are not exactly appropriated:–Criterion B1 leads to solve the following minimization problem:minmtk-1E[Ltk-1-Ctk|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1].We have:(18)E[Ltk-1-Ctk|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1]=E[Ltk-1-Ctk-1(1+mtk-1[eYtk-1])|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1],=Ltk-1-Ctk-1(1+mtk-1E[eYtk-1|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1])Then:IfE[eYtk-1|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1]>0, then there is no solution (this is an ill-posed problem since its solution corresponds to −∞). It corresponds to the search for the maximal conditional expectation of the cushion.IfE[eYtk-1|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1]<0, thenmtk-1=0, which is a degenerate solution.Criterion B2 does not take account of the constraint on the portfolio strategy if the cushion becomes negative (i.e.mtk-1=0ifCtk-1⩽0).Therefore, we use only the criterion B3 that we detail and analyze in what follows.Recall that the risk control of a financial position X by means of expected shortfall criterion is based on two steps:–First, we have to determine the Value-at-RiskVaRX(α)at a given probability levelα. We have:P[X⩽-VaRX(α)]=α,α∈]0,1[.Note thatVaRX(α)is equal to the opposite of the quantileqX(α)of X at the levelα.Second, we calculate the expected shortfall defined by:ESX(α)=E[qX(α)-X|X⩽qX(α)],α∈]0,1[.We apply a similar approach for the study of criterion B3 in a dynamic framework:First, we determine the values ofmtk-1which correspond to the quantile condition as defined in Assumption A3. For the given probability levelα(which is equal to1-(1-∊)1Tin assumption A3), we consider the setMtk-1(α,Ltk-1)ofmtk-1values such that:(19)P[Ctk⩽Ltk-1|Ftk-1∩Ctk-1>0]⩽α,α∈]0,1[.Note that the setMtk-1(α,Ltk-1)is determined according to Proposition 6.Then, the control of the expected shortfall is defined on the previous set from criterion B3:(20)minmtk-1∈Mtk-1(α,Ltk-1)Ltk-1-E[Ctk|Ftk-1∩Ctk-1>0∩Ctk⩽Ltk-1].Examine now the termLtk-1-E[Ctk|Ftk-1∩Ctk-1>0∩Ctk⩽Ltk-1]. Recall that we considerLtk-1⩾0. Since we have:Ctk=Ctk-1[1+mtk-1(exp(Ytk)-1)].Then we deduce:(21)E[Ltk-1-Ctk|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1∩Ctk<Ltk-1]=E[(Ltk-1-Ctk)ICtk<Ltk-1|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1]P[Ctk<Ltk-1|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1],whereIA, is the indicator function associated to the event A defined here by “Ctkis smaller thanLtk-1.”DenoteΦL(mtk-1)the function given by:(22)ΦL(mtk-1)=E[(Ltk-1-Ctk)ICtk<Ltk-1|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1]P[Ctk<Ltk-1|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1].SinceCtk=Ctk-1[1+mtk-1(exp(Ytk)-1)]andCtk-1>0, then we have the equivalence:Ctk<Ltk-1⇔[1+mtk-1(exp(Ytk)-1)]<Ltk-1Ctk-1.Recall that:Ytk=atk-1+btk-1×εtk,whereatk-1andbtk-1are defined by(23)atk-1=α0+∑i=1Pαi×Ytk-i,btk-1=σtk>0.Therefore, the condition[1+mtk-1(exp(Ytk)-1)]<Ltk-1is equivalent to:16Note that conditionLtk-1Ctk-1-1mtk-1+1>0is satisfied sinceLtk-1⩾0andmtk-1>1. Recall that ifCtk-1⩽0, the investment on the risky asset must be equal to 0 from timetk-1.16(24)εtk<lnLtk-1Ctk-1-1mtk-1+1-atk-1btk-1.DenotelL(mtk-1)=lnLtk-1Ctk-1-1mtk-1+1-atk-1btk-1. Then, we deduce:Proposition 11The expected shortfall condition corresponds to the conditional expectationE[Ltk-1-Ctk|Ftk-1∩Ctk-1>0∩Ctk<Ltk-1]which is equal to(25)Ltk-1-Ctk-1∫-∞lL(mtk-1)[1+mtk-1(exp(atk-1+btk-1x)-1)]×fε(x)dx∫-∞lL(mtk-1)fε(x)dx.Suppose for example thatεti+1is Gaussian. Denote byN(·)the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the standard Gaussian distribution.The expected shortfall condition for the Gaussian case corresponds to the conditional expectation: (SeeAppendix C)We have:l0(mtk-1)=ln1-1mtk-1-atk-1btk-1,l0(mtk-1)-btk-1=ln1-1mtk-1-atk-1-btk-12btk-1,wherel0(mtk-1)does not depend on the cushion valueCtk-1at timetk-1.Therefore, we get:Φ0(mtk-1)=-Ctk-11-mtk-11-expbtk-12+2atk-12N(l0(mtk-1)-btk-1)N(l0(mtk-1)).In Fig. 1, we calculate the value of the expected shortfall functionΦLfor several thresholds L and volatilitiesσ, forV0=100andC0=10. We chooseatk-1=-0.0035andbtk-1(=σtk=σ)=0.01(from some observed data on the S&P 500). The expected shortfall value can reach a (interior) minimum between the lower and upper bounds. The multiple value at which the minimum is reached decreases when the volatility increases. It means that the fund manager must reduce the risk exposure when the usual volatility risk rises. On the contrary, the multiple value increases when the level floor increases. An interpretation of this feature is that, if the protection due to the floor is more efficient, then we can expose more the remaining fund invested on the risky asset. If we chooseLtk-1<Ctk-1(L=0.9in Fig. 1), the minimization of the expected shortfallΦ0(mtk-1)gives always a value of the multiple equal to the lower bound. On the contrary, forLtk-1>Ctk-1, the fund manager must increase the risk exposure in order to expand the probability thatLtk-1<Ctk.In all cases, the conditional volatility and the floor level play a crucial role to determine the conditional multiple that minimizes the expected shortfall function at each time during the management period. Note that this function provides an explicit relation between the risk aversion of the investor when she chooses the floor level, the estimation of financial market parameters through the conditional volatility and finally the management parameter, namely the conditional multiplemtk-1.To summarize, for a fixed probability levelα, we have to solve successively:First step: determination of the solutions corresponding to the quantile condition (VaR of the cushion).P[Ctk⩽Ltk-1|Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1]⩽α,withCtk=Ctk-1[1+mtk-1(exp(Ytk)-1)],Ytk=atk-1+btk-1×εtk.From Section 3.2.2, we have:Consider a given levelLtk-1. The conditionCtk⩽Ltk-1is equivalent to:εtk⩽lnLtk-1Ctk-1-1mtk-1+1-atk-1btk-1︸qα(ε).Then, the conditionP[Ctk⩽Ltk-1Ctk-1>0∩Ftk-1]⩽α,determines the multiple variablemtk-1for each level ofαand fixedLtk-1(see Section 2, criterion A3):–IfCtk-1>Ltk-1andexp(atk-1+btk-1×qα(ε))-1<0(i.e.Ztk-1<0):mtk-1⩽Ltk-1Ctk-1-1exp(atk-1+btk-1×qα(ε))-1.IfCtk-1>Ltk-1andexp(atk-1+btk-1×qα(ε))-1>0(i.e.Ztk-1>0), no constraint onmtk-1.IfCtk-1<Ltk-1andexp(atk-1+btk-1×qα(ε))-1<0(i.e.Ztk-1<0), no solution.WhenLtk-1=0, we get:mtk-1⩽11-exp(atk-1+btk-1×qα(ε)).If (0<)Ctk-1<Ltk-1andexp(atk-1+btk-1×qα(ε))-1>0:mtk-1⩾Ltk-1Ctk-1-1exp(atk-1+btk-1×qα(ε))-1.Denotem̃tk-1(α,Ltk-1)=Ltk-1Ctk-1-1exp(atk-1+btk-1×qα(ε))-1andMtk-1(α,Ltk-1)the set of conditional multiplesmtk-1satisfying the four previous conditions.Second Step: minimization of the expected shortfall.ES∼α[Ctk]=Min{mtk-1∈Mtk-1(α,Ltk-1)}(Ltk-1-E[Ctk|Ftk-1∩Ctk-1>0∩Ctk⩽Ltk-1]).The expected shortfall is minimized for values of the conditional multiplemtk-1which lie between the two bounds of the multiple variablemtk-1and satisfy the VaR condition.We illustrate numerically the values of the CPPI portfolios for both constant and conditional multiples in two main cases: when the risky logreturns of S are independent and when the risky logreturns of S are dependent according to an EGARCH model.For the i.i.d. case, we can determine the value of the multiple according to independence assumption on logreturn process.For example, suppose thatStfollows a geometric Brownian motion, which is the most commonly used financial model. We have:St=S0×expμ-12σ2t+σ×tWt,where, in particular,Wthas a standard Gaussian distributionN(0,1). Recall that we denote by N its cdf.In that case, the randomZtk-1defined in Relation (14) is constant:Ztk-1=μ-12×σ2Δt+σΔt×N-1(1-(1-∊)1/T).Proposition 13Since the fixed multiple m is positive, then the probability that there exists a datetksuch that the cushionCtkis negative is given by:1-P[∀tk,Ctk>0]=1-1-Fln1-1mT,withF(x)=Nx-μ-12×σ2ΔtσΔt.For the simulation, we consider a standard CPPI strategy based on various market timing rebalancing. The time horizon is set to 5years. We illustrate in particular the correspondence between the level of the probability(1-∊)to get the guarantee, the multiple m and the standard deviationσ. For the numerical base case, we fix the value of the instantaneous rate of returnμ=5%and consider a volatility equal to 20%. Table 1provides the probability that the guarantee does not hold during the management period, according to rebalancing frequency, management parameter (here, the multiple m) and financial parametersμandσ.The rebalancing frequency obviously plays an important role to determine the probability of not having the guarantee. The higher this frequency, the smaller the probability of not having the guarantee. When the volatility or/and the mean logreturn or/and the constant multiple increase, the probability of not having the guarantee increases too.In what follows, we provide an empirical illustration of several CPPI strategies based on the S&P 500 dynamics. Therefore, in a first step, we detail the statistical analysis of S&P 500 data, based on GARCH type models. Many previous studies have emphasized the importance of the asymmetric model GARCH to estimate the conditional volatility. The asymmetric GARCH implies that negative shocks induce greater volatility than positive shocks. Poon and Granger (2003) compare several studies that concern the GARCH models. They conclude that in general the asymmetric volatility performs better than usual GARCH. Heynen, Kemna, and Vorst (1994) argue that exponential GARCH gives the best description of asset prices according to the Akaike information criterion. Chen and Kuan (2002) test several models to determine the conditional volatility and accept only the EGARCH for several index prices. Engel and Ng (1993) show that the model EGARCH can capture most of the asymmetry of the time series but the model presents high conditional variance. Awartani and Corradi (2005) study the daily data of the S&P 500 composite index. They prove that the asymmetric model GARCH gives the best estimation since it can capture the leverage effect. Due to the previous empirical results, we choose the EGARCH (1,1) model to illustrate the theoretical results of Section 3. We use parameter values such as in Nelson (1990) to simulate and estimate the conditional volatility. Thus, we have:(27)Ytk=α0+α1Ytk-1+σtkεtk,whereεtkare i.i.d. variables with standard Gaussian distribution andσtis the conditional volatility defined by:(28)lnσtk2=c0+g(εtk-1)+d1lnσtk-12,withg(εtk-1)=ξ×εtk-1+γ(|εtk-1|-E|εtk-1|).We consider S&P 500 historical weekly logreturns on the period 01/1970–10/2012. We have 2276 observations. We determine the parameters of the EGARCH (1,1) model from the pseudo maximum likelihood method using MATLAB. Then, we put these parameters into the EGARCH (1,1) model to produce simulations. This method allows getting simulations very close to the true behavior of the S&P 500 historical weekly logreturns on the period 01/1970–10/2012. We have 2276 observations. The sample is split into two periods: the first one (until 10/2008) is used to estimate the parameters; the rest of the sample is used to test the model. Next figure presents the empirical distribution function of the S&P 500 weekly logreturns together with the innovations (processεtk), the conditional standard deviationσtkand the returns. We observe that empirical and simulated distributions are very close (see Fig. 2)Table 2presents the descriptive statistics of the S&P 500 weekly logreturns on the period 01/1970–10/2012.The S&P 500 yields present an excess kurtosis compared to the Gaussian distribution(7.5662>3). This feature illustrates the fat tails of the probability distribution that shows a significant probability of extreme returns. Note also that the skewness is negative(-0.3183). Therefore, the S&P 500 logreturn does not follow a Gaussian distribution. We observe that we have a maximum drop equal to-18.20%, during the financial crisis.To determine the variable multiple, we must estimate the parameters ofZtk-1. For this purpose, we use the pseudo maximum Log-likelihood method to fit as best as possible the S&P 500 data. It is shown that in this case the estimators converge (for more details on this method, see Gouriéroux & Monfort, 1989). This method is based on the normality assumption of conditional distribution:(Ytk-α0)α1Ytk-1Ftk-1∼N(0;σtk).The pseudo Log likelihood function with heteroscedastic errors is defined by:l(θ)=∑i=1nlogf(Yti;θ),whereθdenotes the vector of parameters to be estimated.We obtain the conditional log-likelihood function:logl(θ)=-Tlogσˆtk(θ)-T2log2π-12∑k=1TYtk-mtk(θ)2σ2^tk(θ).The method of pseudo maximum likelihood estimatesθˆby finding the value of this parameters that maximizel(θ). We use algorithms of optimization.17We use MATLAB R2008a with numerical procedures to determine the parameters that minimize the function-l(θ).17We use the EGARCH (1,1) model to estimate the conditional volatility. In Section (4-2) we have developed the choice criteria of this model. We find:logσtk2=c0-0.4188+d10.9458logσtk-12+γ0.2129[|εtk-1|-E{|εtk-1|}]+ξ-0.1266εtk-1,whereE{|εtk-1|}=2πfor the Gaussian law.Then the conditional quantileZtk-1is given by:(29)Ztk-1=α00.0013+α1-0.0485×Ytk-1+σtk×N-1(1-(1-∊)1/T).All terms are statistically significant, in particular the leverage parameterξwhich is negative. This emphasizes the importance of asymmetrical effect.In what follows, we illustrate how the conditional multiple varies according to fluctuations of the conditional volatility. We chooseLtk-1=qCtk-1withq=0.8.All the values ofZtk-1are negative. Thus, we can set the value of the conditional multiple equal to the upper bound given in Relation(15) from the quantile condition.First, Fig. 3(A) shows the path ofZtk-1and those of the conditional volatilityσtk. From Relation (14) (see also expression ofZtk-1in (29)), we deduce thatZtk-1is a decreasing function with respect to the conditional volatilityσtksinceN-1(α)<0(withα=1-(1-∊)1/T). It implies in particular that, in periods of high volatility, the value ofZtk-1is adjusted downward.Second, Fig. 3(B) shows the path ofmtk-1and those of the conditional volatilityσtk. SinceLtk-1<Ctk-1, the upper bound of the multiple given in (15) is an increasing function ofZtk-1. Therefore, it is decreasing function with respect to the conditional volatility. The set of values lies between 1 and 6.We are interested in finding a variable multiple. As shown in Section 3, we determine the values ofexp[Ztk-1]-1according to the EGARCH (1,1) model.According to Proposition 6 and Corollary 8, the upper bound on the multiple is given byLtk-1Ctk-1-1exp[Ztk-1]-1forLtk-1⩾0. Since the purpose of the portfolio insurance is to benefit from market rises once the guarantee is satisfied, we set the variable multiple equal to the upper bound:mtk-1=11-exp[Ztk-1],forLtk-1=0,LCtk-1-1exp[Ztk-1]-1,forLtk-1>0.ForLtk-1=0andα=1%, we find that the variable multiple values belong to the interval[30,60]. Applying these values lead to too many risky positions: even with small negative returns, the floor is almost certainly burst (form=50, it happens as soon as the return is equal to-2%).If we setLtk-1>0where the value ofLtk-1is a given percentage of the initial cushionCt0or a proportion of the current cushionCtk-1, we obtain variable multiple values lying between 2 and 10.To illustrate this strategy, we compare its results to the standard CPPI strategy with constant multiplem=3andm=6. We chooseLtk-1=0.6Ctk-1orLtk-1=0.8Ctk-1.We generate 10,000 paths of the risky asset for a five years horizon. They correspond to the weekly logreturns from the model EGARCH (1,1).We setVt0=100at the beginning of the period and consider two guaranteed percentagesFT=Vt0andFT=0.95Vt0at the end of the period. We also set the yearly interest rate r equal to 0.02 and an investment horizon equal toT=5years. Thus, the initial cushion valueCt0=Vt0-e-rTFTis equal to 9.51 forFT=Vt0and to 14.04 forFT=0.95Vt0.We obtain the empirical cdf of the portfolio values at maturity (five years) (see Fig. 4):We do not observe a first order stochastic dominance between the empirical cdf forFT=100andFT=95. The empirical cdf corresponding to the model with variable multiple and thresholdLtk-1=0.8Ctk-1provides a better result than the CPPI strategy withm=6andLtk-1=0.6Ctk-1in the interval[100,120]of values of the simulated S&P 500. It gets better performance than the CPPI strategy withm=3in the interval[120,200].Under our parametric model, we determine a variable multiple according to another criterion, namely the expected shortfall criterion, the information available at timetk-1generated by the market values and the latest value of the cushionCtk-1. In next section, we show how to apply the model of the variable multiple according to this new criterion.For criterion B3, we determine a multiple variable that we callmtk-1∗in two steps.The first step of this criterion consists in determining values of the variable multiplemtk-1according to quantile condition18See Section 2, criterion A3.18and assumptions aboutCtk-1andLtk-1, as in Proposition 6. Note that hereZtk-1is equal toatk-1+btk-1×qα(ε).For the second step, we determine a value ofmtk-1∗that minimizes the following expression of the expected loss:ES∼α[Ctk]=Min{mtk-1∈Mtk-1(α,Ltk-1)}(Ltk-1-E[Ctk|Ftk-1∩Ctk-1>0∩Ctk⩽Ltk-1]).The lower bound is fixedm̲=2to benefit sufficiently from market rises19As shown in Fig. 1,ES∼α[Ctk]can be increasing and the minimum equal to 1 (left figure). In that case, conditionm̲=2is necessary to avoid a degenerate case. IfES∼α[Ctk]is decreasing then increasing (see right figure), the constraintm⩾m̲=2is not saturated.19and the upper bound is the conditional value determined from the VaR condition. The thresholdLtk-1is the same for the multiple determined from the VaR condition as for the expected shortfall condition. Then necessarily0⩽Ltk-1⩽Ctk-1.The minimization of theES∼α[Ctk]always provides values of multiple equal to the lower bound.Case 1:L=0.We have to examine the values ofΦL(mtk-1)as defined in expression (26). It is defined by:Φ0(mtk-1)=-Ctk-11-mtk-11-expbtk-12+2atk-12N(l0(mtk-1)-btk-1)N(l0(mtk-1)).Our goal is to determine the multiple value m that minimizes this function, allowing to reduce the gap risk. The minimization of the expected shortfall criterion provides multiple values which belong to the interval[1.5,4.5]. These values can be applied in practice.Fig. 5(A) shows the empirical distribution functions of the payoff of the variable multiples model forLtk-1=0and for standard multiple values:m=3andm=6. Fig. 5(B) illustrates these empirical distribution functions forLtk-1>Ctk-1(Ltk-1=1.05Ctk-1andLtk-1=1.1Ctk-1). From definition (29), we haveatk-1=α0+α1×Ytk-1withα0=0.0013andα1=-0.0485andbtk-1=σtkwhereYtk-1,σtkandZtk-1are random variables respectively defined in (27)–(29).The fixing of a thresholdLtk-1=0is too restrictive for the model under expected shortfall condition. Certainly, we can have a better guarantee than with standard multiple form=3andm=6, but this guarantee has a cost. It does not take full advantage of market increases.Case 2:0<Ltk-1<Ctk-1.Choosing a fixed or variable threshold L between 0 and the last cushion value allows us to determine a variable multiple that minimizes the functionΦL(mtk-1)on a fixed interval. Numerical illustrations of this model show that the minimization of the expected shortfall gives a value of multiple always equal to the lower bound of our interval.Case 3:Ltk-1>Ctk-1.This strategy is seen as a particular strategy of the CPPI method. Indeed, by fixing a thresholdLtk-1at each timetk-1that is higher than the last cushion valueCtk-1, we can determine the value of the conditional multiple. This last one allows us to reach the particular thresholdLtk-1while minimizing the potential loss for a level probabilityα. In Section 3.3, we introduce and analyze the expected shortfall as risk measure at every rebalancing moment to determine a function of potential loss that is dependent on the multiple value. Then, when choosingLtk-1>Ctk-1, this strategy can be considered as a special case of speculative strategy, although the first goal of the CPPI method is to guarantee the portfolio for a fixed floor level. To observe the values of the conditional multiple forLtk-1>Ctk-1, we choose the following values forLtk-1:Ltk-1=1.05Ctk-1andLtk-1=1.1Ctk-1. The conditional multiplemtk-1is the value that minimizes the expected shortfall functionΦL(mtk-1)on a fixed interval2,20.20The value 2 is the lower boundmto avoid degeneracy of the CPPI strategy. The value 20 is just an upper bound to define a finite subset on which we want to optimize. In practice, m is generally smaller than 10.20This minimization allows us to get values which can be used in practice and depend on market volatility, on the last cushion value and on the probability level that we set. Fig. 5(B) shows the empirical distribution functions of the standard CPPI strategy and of the CPPI strategy with conditional multiple under expected shortfall condition. We note that, if we increase the proportion of the threshold fromLtk-1=1.05Ctk-1toLtk-1=1.1Ctk-1, we increase the probability of capturing more market performance, while having a riskier exposure.We apply our model for the two very volatile periods from 11/2006 to 11/2011 and from 10/2008 to 10/2012. We adopt a weekly rebalancing. We compare the result to the standard CPPI model form=3andm=6. During these periods, the market goes through several phases and particularly towards the end of 2008 where we note the stock market crash related to the subprime crisis and the debt crisis during 2011. We suppose that the log-returns of the S&P 500 follows an EGARCH (1,1) model. The selection criteria of this model are outlined in Section 4.3.In Fig. 6, the dynamic portfolio values forFT=V0and forFT=0.95V0are displayed as function of the current time. The wealth initial valueV0is still equal to 100. The annual riskless rate r is equal to 2%.21Since r is small, the curve of the floort→ertis almost flat.21Fig. 6(A) and (B) shows that the CPPI model withm=6provides higher gains than other models when the market is bullish, but, with the financial crash of October 2008, the portfolio is fully monetized for the two floor valuesFT=V0andFT=0.95V0, although this value of multiple is not considered as a very high value. On the other hand, withm=3, we were unable to capture large market performances. With the two models of the conditional multiple under VaR condition with a variable thresholdLtk-1=0.85Ctk-1and, under expected shortfall as risk measure, withLtk-1=1.1Ctk-1, we get higher performances than with standard multiplem=3. The multiple, determined with expected shortfall condition, takes values in interval[1.5,4.5], while the multiple determined with quantile condition takes values in interval[1.5,6]. This allows the explanation that portfolio CPPI with VaR condition reaches a higher level than portfolio with expected shortfall condition.Fig. 6(C) and (D), illustrate what has happened during the second period from 10/2008 to 10/2012. At the beginning of the period with the financial crash of October 2008, the CPPI portfolio withm=6has experienced a very significant loss and has finished the period fully monetized for the two floor valuesFT=V0andFT=0.95V0. With multiple equal tom=3, like the first period, this portfolio was unable to capture large market performance.As illustrated for these two periods, the performance results are robust with the two models of the conditional multiple under VaR condition with a variable thresholdLtk-1=0.85Ctk-1. Additionally, under the measure risk expected shortfall withLtk-1=1.1Ctk-1, we can have higher performances than with standard multiplem=3.Then, during the subprime crisis which have generated high volatilities on the market, these two models have reduced the exposure to the risky asset (here the S&P 500) by decreasing the multiple values. The portfolio values have remained above the floor whereas the standard CPPI portfolio withm=6has been fully monetized, due to higher risk exposure. Therefore, conditional models (VaR and Expected Shortfall) have been better adapted to market conditions. At the beginning of the period, they have reduced their exposure to the risky asset S&P 500 to hedge against the bear market better. Then, for the second period, both conditional multiples have risen to benefit from market growth better.
