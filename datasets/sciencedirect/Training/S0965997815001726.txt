@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An innovative procedure for characterizing thermo-mechanical behavior of superalloy using the Eigenfunction Virtual Fields Method (EVFM) was proposed. First, the principle of EVFM for thermo-mechanical constants identification was developed based on the principal components analysis. Then, the strain fields were extracted from finite element (FE) simulation of a superalloy plate with a circular hole under uniaxial tension and uniform temperature increment. In addition, the virtual fields were constructed using the eigenvectors of augmented strain matrix. Finally, the thermo-mechanical constants were inversed from the strain fields, and the effect of mesh size and noise on the inversion results was analyzed. The results show that the thermo-mechanical constants of superalloy inversed from EVFM using these eigenvectors as virtual fields are in excellent agreement with the true values.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Superalloy materials are widely used in aviation and aerospace fields as engine materials due to its excellent high temperature thermo-mechanical behavior [1,2]. However, how to characterize the thermo-mechanical constants of superalloy materials correctly, accurately and simply is an important and difficult problem. Virtual Fields Method (VFM), which was proposed by Grédiac and Pierron [3,4], provides an effective tool for high temperature parameter identification of materials. VFM brings the advantage of full-field and non-contact of optical measurement into play.VFM has been commonly applied in many areas since it was proposed. Among these applications, the elastic stiffness identification is one of the most interested fields. Grédiac et al. applied VFM to the identification of hyperelastic parameters [5], elasto-plastic constitutive parameters [6], bending rigidities of anisotropic plates [7]. Pierron et al. extended the virtual fields method to elasto-plastic material identification with cyclic loads and kinematic hardening [8] and identification of elasto-visco-plastic parameters [9]. Rahmani et al. used VFM to mechanical properties identification of 3D particulate composites [10] and proposed a Regularized Virtual Fields Method (RVFM) to characterize mechanical properties of composite materials [11]. Xie et al. applied VFM to elastic stiffness identification of composite materials [12] and 3D printing material [13]. Ma et al. [14] used VFM to inverse and decouple thermo-mechanical deformation of anisotropic materials under high-temperature environments. Furthermore, Gao and Shang [15] proposed a Deformation-Pattern-based Digital Image Correlation (DPDIC) method to measure directly residual stresses by digital image correlation using hole drilling. The deformation pattern that was governed by the residual stresses was used to affine transform the image captured after the object was deformed. Liu and Gao [16] extended DPDIC to measure coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of film, and the results of CTEs from DPDIC and conventional DIC methods were compared with the actual CTE, showing an improved accuracy.Recently, Subramanian et al. [17] proposed an Eigenfunction Virtual Fields Method (EVFM), which systematically identifies virtual fields by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) of the strain field measured from experiments. The virtual strain components to be used in VFM are then chosen to be the eigenfunctions. In addition to being a physically meaningful set of virtual fields, such a choice exploits the orthogonality of the computed eigenfunctions while simultaneously eliminating computation of a large number of coefficients that define the virtual fields in prior approaches. They applied EVFM to homogeneous linear elastic property evaluation [17], computation of elastic constants of functionally graded materials [18] and identification of orthotropic elastic constants [19,20].In the present work, the EVFM was extended to thermo-mechanical parameters identification of superalloy materials under high temperature environment. The principle of EVFM for thermo-mechanical parameters identification was presented firstly. Then, a finite element simulation was carried out on a superalloy plate with a circular hole under uniaxial tension and uniform temperature increment. The eigenfunctions calculated from the strain fields were selected as virtual fields to inverse thermo-mechanical parameters. Finally, the effect of mesh size and noise on the inversion results was analyzed.EVFM is based on the eigenfunctions of strain field, and the strain field usually calculated from full-field optical method, such as digital image correlation, on a grid of m×n points. Two augmented matrices Erand Ecof sizes 3m×n and m×3n respectively are constructed from the strain component grids as follows [17]:(1)Er=[E1E2E3];Ec=[E1E2E3]where E1, E2 and E3 are the strain components on the grid points. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is performed on the Erand Ec, and the eigenfunctions are obtained by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The decompositions are(2)E(3m×n)r=L(3m×3m)rS(3m×n)r(Rr)(n×n)T(3)E(m×3n)c=L(m×m)cS(m×3n)c(Rc)(3n×3n)Twhere the columns of Lrand Lccontain the left eigenvectors of Erand Ec; Srand Scare diagonal matrices that contain the singular values of Erand Ec; the columns of Rrand Rccontain the right eigenvectors of Erand Ec, respectively. A significant advantage of this decomposition is that each group of eigenvectors is a complete orthonormal basis; therefore, the right eigenvectors are orthonormal basis for the row space of each augmented matrix, as well as the left eigenvectors are orthonormal basis for the column space [17].It is proved that full-field strain data are highly redundant and only a small number (p) eigenvectors are dominant. Thus, it is adequate to reconstruct the strain matrices in terms of the p-dimensional subspace of the row and column spaces spanned by these p dominant left and right eigenvectors. IfE¯1ris the reconstructed matrix of strain values E1 using the p right eigenvectors of Er, then(4)E¯1r=A¯1r(R¯r)T=E1R¯r(R¯r)TwhereR¯ris the n×p matrix whose columns contain the p right dominant eigenvectors of Er; andA¯1r=E1R¯ris an m×p matrix, which contains the rows of E1 along the columns ofR¯r. It is evident that the kth row(E¯1r)(k,−)ofE¯1rcan be obtained as(5)(E¯1r)(k,−)=(A¯1r)(k,−)(R¯r)TIn the same way,E¯1cis the reconstructed matrix of E1 from the p dominant left eigenvectors of Ec, which is given by(6)E¯1c=L¯c(A¯1c)T=L¯c(L¯c)TE1whereL¯cis the m×p matrix whose columns contain the p left eigenvectors of Ec; andA¯1c=(E1)TL¯cis an p×n matrix, which contains the columns of E1 along the columns ofL¯c. The other two strain component matrices are reconstructed similarly.As shown in Fig. 1, a solid with constant thickness of any shape subjected to in-plane thermo-mechanical loading. Here, V is the volume occupied by the solid of interest, and S is the exterior surface of the solid. Suand Sfare the displacement boundary and the loading boundary of the external surface area, respectively. ui(i = 1,2) is the displacement over the displacement boundary. Ti(i = 1,2) is the force per unit area over the loading boundary. Thus, the governing equation of virtual work can be expressed as [3,14](7)∫Vσiɛi*dV=∫sfTiui*dSwhereui*(i=1,2) is any kinematically admissible virtual displacement field;ɛi*(i=1,2,12) is the virtual strain; σi(i=1,2,12) is the stress.Under the thermo-mechanical loading conditions, the stress-strain relations of isotropic superalloy materials can be expressed as follows:(8)(σ1σ2σ12)=[Q1Q20Q2Q1000Q12](ɛ1−αΔTɛ2−αΔTɛ12)whereQ1=E1−μ2,Q2=μQ1=Eμ1−μ2,Q12=Q1−Q22=G=E2(1+μ)are the coefficients of the stiffness matrix. α is the thermal expansion coefficients of the isotropic superalloy materials. ɛi(i=1,2,12) is the true strain field. ΔT(1, 2) is the temperature increment in the coordinate (1,2). Then, Eq. (7) can be expressed as(9)h∫Sɛ1*[Q1(ɛ1−αΔT)+Q2(ɛ2−αΔT)]dS+h∫Sɛ2*[Q2(ɛ1−αΔT)+Q1(ɛ2−αΔT)]dS+h∫Sɛ12*[Q12ɛ12]dS=∫Sf(T1u1*+T2u2*)dSwhere h is the thickness of the solid.Eq. (9) can be simplified as(10)Eh1−μ2∫Sɛ1*[(ɛ1+μɛ2)−(1+μ)αΔT]dS+Eh1−μ2∫Sɛ2*[(μɛ1+ɛ2)−(1+μ)αΔT]dS+Eh2(1+μ)∫Sɛ12*ɛ12dS=∫Sf(T1u1*+T2u2*)dSSince the primary objective of this paper is to demonstrate the accuracy of EVFM for thermo-mechanical properties, strain fields from a FE solution to the plane-stress deformation of a plate made of superalloy materials with a hole, subjected to remote tension and uniform temperature increment (ΔT=100 °C) were generated. The material parameters used in this study are listed in Table 1(GH4169 superalloy) and the geometry and boundary conditions for this problem are shown in Fig. 2and Table 2. A converged mesh of 4244 quadratic plane stress elements and 4390 nodes were used in this study. Each of the strain components ɛ1, ɛ2, ɛ12 obtained at the centroids of the elements in the region of interest (ROI) form a 20×100 matrix and these were used in the EVFM computations described below. The variation of displacements and strains in the region of interest are shown in Figs. 3and 4.As explained in Grama and Subramanian [21], Principal Component Analysis was performed to identify the p dominant eigenfunctions of Ec; in this case, p=6 dominant eigenfunctions were identified from the knee in the plot of the singular values (SV) of Ecand the first 6 are shown in the Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Next, virtual fields were constructed from these dominant eigenfunctions; here, left eigenfunctions (of the length m) were used as virtual strain fields.Before the actual virtual fields are described, the following piece-wise continuous versions of the discrete eigenvectors obtained in the previous section are defined [19]:(11)fn(X1;r)=∑k=1nNk(X1)rk;Nk(X1)={1,if(X1)k−ΔX12<X1<(X1)k+ΔX120,otherwisewhereΔX1=L1n, (X1)kis the X1 value at the kth grid location and rkis the kth component of the right eigenvector r. A similar function fm(withΔX2=L2m) is defined for a left eigenvector l as(12)fm(X2;l)=∑k=1mNk(X2)lk;Nk(X2)={1,if(X2)k−ΔX22<X2<(X2)k+ΔX220,otherwiseNote that due to orthonormality of the eigenvectors, the following results for the inner products between ith and jth hold:(13)∫0L1fn(X1;ir)fn(X1;jr)dX1=δijΔX1;∫0L2fm(X2;il)fm(X2;jl)dX1=δijΔX2whereδijis the Kronecker delta.A set of p virtual fields may be constructed using the p dominant left eigenvectors of Ec:(14)(i=1,p):iɛ1*=0;iɛ2*=fm(X2,ilc);iɛ12*=0Hereilcis the ith dominant left eigenvector of Ec. Virtual displacement fields compatible with these virtual strain fields may be obtained straightforwardly for anyX2|(X2)j−ΔX22<X2<(X2)j+ΔX22as(15)(i=1,p):iu1*=0;iu2*=∫0X2ɛ2*(s)ds=[∑k=1j−1ilkc]ΔX2+iljc(X2−(X2)j)whereilkcis the kth component of the ith left eigenvector of Ec.For the problem at hand the boundary S consists of four surfaces EF, FG, GH, HE on which the true traction and virtual displacement fields are as follows:(16)ST:{EF:tj=0;iu1*=0;iu2*≠0FG:tj≠0;iu1*=0;iu2*=[∑k=1milkc]ΔX2GH:tj=0;iu1*=0;iu2*≠0(17)Su:HE:tj≠0;iu1*=0;iu2*=0Thus, Eq. (10) yields(18)Eh1−μ2∫Sɛ2*[(μɛ1+ɛ2)−(1+μ)αΔT]dS=∫SFGT2iu2*dSNow, the internal virtual work integral on the left hand side can be evaluated along vertical strips as(19)(i=1,p):I=Eh1−μ2∑k=1n∫Skiɛ2*[(μɛ1+ɛ2)−(1+μ)αΔT]dSwhere Skis the area of a slice of widthΔX1=L1nand length L2 centered around X1=(X1)k. The integral over the kth slice is now considered.(20)Ik=EhΔX11−μ2∫0L2fm(X2,ilc)[(μɛ1+ɛ2)−(1+μ)αΔT]X1=(X1)kdX2Along each horizontal strip, X1=(X1)k=constant and ε1and ε2 can be expressed as linear combinations of the piecewise-continuous p dominant right eigenvectors:(21)ɛ1((X1)k,X2)=∑l=1p(A¯1c)(l,k)fm(X2,ilc)(22)ɛ2((X1)k,X2)=∑l=1p(A¯2c)(l,k)fm(X2,ilc)Then, Ikbecomes(23)Ik=EhΔX11−μ2∫0L2fm(X2,ilc)[μ∑l=1p(A¯1c)(l,k)fm(X2,ilc)+∑l=1p(A¯2c)(l,k)fm(X2,ilc)−(1+μ)αΔT]X1=(X1)kdX2=EhΔX1ΔX21−μ2[μ(A¯1c)(i,k)+(A¯2c)(i,k)−(1+μ)αΔT∑k=1milkc]To evaluate the right-hand side of Eq. (18), it is noted that although the true distribution of tractions over Suare not known, their net resultant along the 2-direction is known to be P. Since the virtual displacements are uniform over this segment, it can be obtained(24)∫SFGT2iu2*dS=P∑t=1miltcand the principle of virtual work can be written as the system of linear equations(25)(i=1,p):EhΔX1ΔX21−μ2∑k=1n[μ(A¯1c)(i,k)+(A¯2c)(i,k)]−(1+μ)αΔT∑k=1milkc=P∑t=1miltcIn the present case, p=6; thus, there are 6 equations for the three unknown variables E, μ and α.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The EVFM has been formulated and applied to the problem of estimation of thermo-mechanical properties of superalloy materials from full-field strain data. Some important conclusions are as follows:(1)The EVFM has been successfully applied to the computation of thermo-mechanical properties of superalloy materials using three virtual fields based on eigenfunctions of the strain field, which has potential applications in thermo-mechanical parameter measurements and full-field deformation analysis under high-temperature environment.The computed material properties are in excellent agreement with the true values. The effect of mesh size on the inversion results was analyzed, and the results show that this influence is less than 10% in the simulation.The effect of noise has been studied by adding Gaussian white noise to the synthetic strain data. It is shown that the material parameters are less sensitive to noise when computed by the present method. This is mainly because experimental noise usually corresponds to lower order eigenvectors, eigenvector orthonormality automatically reduces the effect of noise on the virtual work equations, and therefore, on the computed material parameters.
