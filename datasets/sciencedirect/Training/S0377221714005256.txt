@&#ABSTRACT@&#
One index satisfies the duality axiom if one agent, who is uniformly more risk-averse than another, accepts a gamble, the latter accepts any less risky gamble under the index. Aumann and Serrano (2008) show that only one index defined for so-called gambles satisfies the duality and positive homogeneity axioms. We call it a duality index. This paper extends the definition of duality index to all outcomes including all gambles, and considers a portfolio selection problem in a complete market, in which the agent’s target is to minimize the index of the utility of the relative investment outcome. By linking this problem to a series of Merton’s optimum consumption-like problems, the optimal solution is explicitly derived. It is shown that if the prior benchmark level is too high (which can be verified), then the investment risk will be beyond any agent’s risk tolerance. If the benchmark level is reasonable, then the optimal solution will be the same as that of one of the Merton’s series problems, but with a particular value of absolute risk aversion, which is given by an explicit algebraic equation as a part of the optimal solution. According to our result, it is riskier to achieve the same surplus profit in a stable market than in a less-stable market, which is consistent with the common financial intuition.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Diamond and Stiglitz (1974) point out that whether or not a person takes a gamble depends on two distinct considerations:(i) The attributes of the gamble and, in particular, how risky it is; and(ii) The attributes of the person and, in particular, how averse he or she is to risk.In terms of the first issue, the concept of the risk measure has been used to explain how risky a gamble is. Many well-studied risk measures are described in the literature, such as the superhedging price, value at risk, tail value at risk, and expected shortfall as well as general coherent risk measures. These measures emphasize certain aspects of risk. However, few of them directly reflect the risk-averse person’s attitude; that is, the perspective that “risk is what risk-averters hate” (Machina & Rothschild, 2008). The entropic risk measure, which depends on such a risk aversion through the exponential utility function, is one of the few to have attempted to capture this feature. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the existing measures, Aumann and Serrano (2008) have developed one risk measure which emphasizes such a risk-averters’ attitude. This preserves many properties of the coherent risk measure such as first-order monotonicity, convexity and positive homogeneity. Unlike the coherent risk measure, however, it is also second-order monotonic, which is consistent with the emphasis on the risk-averters’ attitude. Unfortunately, Aumann and Serrano (2008) only define the measure for a certain type of discrete random variables called gambles. It is acknowledged that most outcomes in financial applications are of continuous or mixed type, so their measure cannot be applied to many of theses outcomes. To incorporate general outcomes such as price of stocks, options and general contingent claims, this paper generalizes the definition of the measure to cover all random variables. The measure, like the original, will satisfy an essential axiom, namely the duality axiom. This axiom states that if one agent, who is uniformly more risk-averse than another agent, accepts a gamble, the latter will accept any less-risky gamble under the measure. It clearly demonstrates the solid connection between the measure and the attitude of the risk-averter. We therefore label it as the duality risk measure or duality index. The axiomatic characterization of the measure will be considered in detail in the following section.In terms of the second consideration, utility functions have been used to describe the risk-aversion of an agent. The most widely used utility functions are concave, which represents that the agent is globally risk-averse. Kahneman and Tversky (1979, 1992) consider S-shaped utility functions1S-shaped utility function is convex on the negative return and concave on the positive return.1to reflect the risk-seeking attitude of the agent in a loss situation and the risk-averse attitude in a gain situation. Meanwhile, they also introduce a reference point to separate gain and loss situations. Though many other utility functions are considered in the literature, only the globally risk-averse (which includes risk-neutral) agent as well as a reference point will be discussed in this paper. The reference point reflects the agent’s relative financial situation.To incorporate both considerations, namely how risky an outcome is and how risk-averse the agent is, we introduce a portfolio selection problem. This problem aims to find out a portfolio that minimizes the duality risk measure of the utility of the relative investment outcome, that is the difference between the investment outcome and the benchmark level. The risk measure addresses the first consideration and the utility function the second. Since the duality risk measure is highly nonlinear, we adopt a novel idea to deal with the portfolio selection problem, by firstly linking the problem to a series of Merton’s optimum consumption-like problems, and then solving them using the well-known Lagrange method. It turns out that the original problem is equivalent to one of the series problems but with a particular choice of absolute risk aversion, which is given by an explicit algebraic equation as a part of the explicit optimal solution. Thus the explicit solution of the original problem is derived and the problem is completely solved. A critical threshold is also derived, so that once the surplus level (that is, the difference between the benchmark level and initial endowment) is beyond a threshold, the investment risk will exceed the agent’s risk tolerance. In particular, if the agent is risk-neutral, that is to say with a linear utility function, then the investment risk will grow linearly with respect to (w.r.t.) the surplus level. The investment risk is also positively related to the entropy of the pricing kernel of the market. The result verifies the common financial intuition that it is much harder and riskier to achieve the same surplus profit in a stable market than in a less-stable market.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the duality risk measure for all outcomes, studies its properties and axiomatic characterization, and then shows that it is the unique nontrivial index satisfying two axioms. Section 3 presents a portfolio selection problem under a complete market setting. The problem is to find a possible outcome to minimize the duality risk measure of the utility of the relative investment outcome. Section 4 is devoted to solving this portfolio selection problem. We first study how well posed the problem is, that is, whether its value is finite. Then we link it to a series of Merton’s optimum consumption-like problems via a bridge problem. The series is then treated using the standard Lagrange method. Finally, the optimal solution and value of the original problem are derived. Analytical and numerical examples are also presented in Section 4 to illustrate the main result of this paper. We conclude the paper in Section 5.In order to define the duality risk measure, we need to review some of the concepts used in Aumann and Serrano (2008).A gamble is a random variable whose mean is positive and that takes finitely many values, some of which are negative.Say that an agent with utility function u accepts a gamble g at wealth w2Throughout this paper, wealth is constant.2ifE[u(w+g)]>u(w), whereEstands for “expectation”; that is to say, the agent prefers taking that gamble to refusing it at wealth w.3By this definition, no agent accepts 0, which is inconsistent with financial intuition that no loss is an acceptable situation. In Aumann and Serrano (2008), it is not an issue because 0 is not regarded as a gamble. However, we will regard 0 as an outcome in this paper, so we assume that all agents accept 0 throughout this paper. It would not make any essential difference if 0 was assumed to be accepted by nobody.3Throughout this paper, we only consider the risk-averse (which includes risk-neutral) agent; that is to say, u is concave.Say that one agent is uniformly more risk-averse than another, if whenever the former accepts a gamble at some wealth, the latter accepts that gamble at any wealth, but not vice versa.A risk measure or index is a (positive) real-valued function on gambles. A gamble is less risky than another under an index if its index value is strictly less than that of the latter.Now we will introduce two important axioms related to indices.Duality axiom: If one agent, who is uniformly more risk-averse than another, accepts a gamble, then the latter agent will accept any less-risky gamble under the index.Positive homogeneity axiom: If a gamble is scaled by some positive scalar, then the index value is also scaled by the same scalar.Aumann and Serrano (2008) show that, up to a positive multiple, there is a unique index satisfying the above two axioms. The duality axiom is more central than the other because together with the weak conditions of continuity and monotonicity it already implies that the index is unique up to the ordinal equivalent. Thus, we call the unique index satisfying both the duality and positive homogeneity axioms the Aumann–Serrano duality risk measure or Aumann–Serrano duality index, or simply the duality risk measure or duality index. Some important properties of the duality index are listed as follows.Sub-additive: The duality index of the sum of two gambles is no more than the sum of the indices of each gamble.Law-invariant: The duality indices of two identically distributed gambles are the same.Convex: If a gamble is a linear combination of two gambles, then its duality index is no more than the same combination of the indices of each gamble.Monotonic: The duality index decreases monotonically w.r.t. the first- and second-order (stochastic) dominance.4Say that one gamble first-order dominates another one, if its value is always no less than the latter. Say that one gamble second-order dominates another one, if the latter can be obtained by replacing some of the former’s value with an outcome whose mean is that value. Say that one gamble stochastically dominates another one if there is a gamble distributed like the former that dominates the latter. A gamble g second-order stochastic dominates another gamble h if and only ifE[f(g)]⩽E[f(h)]for all decreasing and convex utility functions f.4It is noted that the convexity property is not stated explicitly by Aumann and Serrano (2008), however, this property will play a very important role in our analysis. It accords with the widely accepted financial wisdom that diversified investment reduces risk.Now, let us define the duality index for general outcomes.This paper is going to investigate a portfolio selection problem under the duality index. Portfolio selection means finding the best possible outcome in a certain set under a certain meaning, in the current setting, that is related to the duality index. Every outcome with a mean (which may not be finite) will be considered. The definition of the duality index in Aumann and Serrano (2008) cannot be employed, because the outcomes considered there only take finitely many values, and the index is not well-defined for many of which need to be addressed here. The details will be stated after Example 2.1 below. Therefore, it is necessary to extend the definition of duality index to cover general outcomes.Throughout this paper, the term market refers to a given probability space(Ω,F,P), and outcomes refer to random variables with well-defined finite or infinity mean values in the market. Denote the set of all outcomes asL={X:Xis a real-valuedF-measurable random variable,E[X-]<+∞orE[X+]<+∞},whereX-=max{-X,0}andX+=max{X,0}stand for the loss part and gain part of an outcome X, respectively, andEstands for the mathematical expectation on the given probability space(Ω,F,P).Define the set of outcomes with finite moment generating functions on loss as(1)M={X∈L:E[eεX-]<+∞for some scalarε>0}.It is clear that every moment of lossX-is finite whenX∈Mand every lower bounded outcome belongs toM. In particular, all the gambles considered in Aumann and Serrano (2008) belong toM.We first present several useful results.5Most of proofs in this paper are given in the Appendix.5Lemma 2.1Fix a scalarε>0. ThenE[e-εX]<+∞if and only ifE[eεX-]<+∞.IfE[e-εX]<+∞for some scalarε>0, thenE[e-αX]<+∞whenever0⩽α⩽ε.The setMcan be expressed as(2)M={X∈L:E[e-εX]<+∞for some scalarε>0}and(3)M={X∈L:there isε>0such thatE[e-αX]<+∞whenever0⩽α⩽ε}.Moreover,Mis a convex set.Each outcome is classified into one of the following categories:A={X∈M:E[X+]>E[X-]>0},B={X∈L:E[X-]=0},C={X∈L:E[X-]⩾E[X+],E[X-]>0},D={X∈L:X∉A∪B∪C}.Note that the setA∪B={X∈M:E[X]>0}∪{0}is convex. This simplifies our analysis.Before formally defining the duality index, we need a very important lemma, Basic Lemma, which will be used frequently in the following analysis.Lemma 2.4Basic LemmaLetαˆ=sup{α⩾0:E[e-αX]⩽1}for eachX∈L. Then the mappingα↦E[e-αX]is continuous on[0,αˆ]andE[e-αˆX]⩽1. IfP(X≠0)>0, thenE[e-αX]<1whenever0<α<αˆ, andE[e-αX]>1wheneverα>αˆ. Moreover,0<αˆ<+∞wheneverX∈A,αˆ=+∞wheneverX∈B, andαˆ=0wheneverX∈C∪D.It is very important to notice thatE[e-αˆX]<1may happen in Basic Lemma.6In fact,E[e-αˆX]may take any value between 0 and 1.6Example 2.1Let X be a discrete outcome with distributionP(X=-n)=n-2e-3n-3for each positive integer n,P(X=3)=1-∑n=1∞n-2e-3n-3. ThenX∈A,αˆ=3, andE[e-αX]<1whenever0<α⩽3andE[e-αX]=+∞wheneverα>3.It is not hard to prove thatE[e-αˆX]=1holds in Basic Lemma if and only if there isε>0such that1⩽E[e-εX]<+∞(for example,X∈Ais lower bounded). This allows Aumann and Serrano (2008) to define the duality index as the unique positive root ofE[e-X/R]=1.7When X is a gamble defined in Aumann and Serrano (2008), the equationE[e-X/R]=1admits a unique positive root.7However, as noted above,E[e-X/R]=1may not admit a positive solution, so we have to change the definition of the duality index.Now, we define thedualityindexfor every outcome inL.Definition 2.1Duality index ofX∈Lis defined asαˆ-1, whereαˆ=sup{α⩾0:E[e-αX]⩽1}.8Here0-1stands for+∞. If the definition of duality index is replaced byαˆ′-1, whereαˆ′=sup{α⩾0:E[e-αX]<1}. Then no agent would accept 0 since its duality index would be+∞. This would be consistent with the definition of acceptable in Aumann and Serrano (2008). We think, however, it would contradict the financial intuition that no loss is always an acceptable situation, so we do not adopt this definition.8This definition coincides with the original duality index presented for every outcome discussed in Aumann and Serrano (2008). Denote byR(X)the duality index of X.Let us look at the duality index for outcome in the different categories.•IfX∈A, then0<R(X)<+∞. The risk is moderate. Whether this outcome is accepted by an agent depends on his/her risk tolerance.IfX∈B, thenαˆ=+∞andR(X)=0. There is no risk at all. It is consistent with financial intuition. Any agent will accept this outcome because there is no potential loss.IfX∈C, thenαˆ=0andR(X)=+∞. The risk is intolerable. It is also in conformity financial intuition because no risk-averse agent will accept this outcome.IfX∈D, thenαˆ=0andR(X)=+∞. This risk is also intolerable. BecauseD⊆{X∈L:E[eεX-]=+∞for everyε>0}, the loss is too large.Therefore, it can be concluded thatR(X)is finite if and only if X belongs toA∪B.Several essential properties of the duality index are listed as follows.Proposition 2.5The duality index has the following properties.1.The duality index is subadditive:R(X+Y)⩽R(X)+R(Y)for anyX,Y.The duality index is positive homogeneous:R(kX)=kR(X)for any scalark>0and X.The duality index is convex.The duality index is nonnegative and law-invariant.The duality index is monotonically decreasing w.r.t. the first- and second-order (stochastic) dominance.In this section, we show that the duality index satisfies the duality and positive homogeneity axioms, which is unique.We need a technical result as follows. It shows that the duality index is continuous under the meaning given below.Lemma 2.6Letu(·)be an increasing function andX∈Lsatisfyu(w+X)∈Lat some wealth w. LetXn=min{max{X,-n},n}. Thenlimn→+∞R(Xn)=R(X)andlimn→+∞E[u(w+Xn)]=E[u(w+X)].The duality index defined inDefinition 2.1is the unique, nontrivial, nonnegative real-valued index onLthat satisfies both the duality and positive homogeneity axioms.9Say that a nonnegative real-valued index is nontrivial, the index of an outcome is zero if and only if the outcome is accepted by all risk-averse agents. In fact, the latter means the outcome is nonnegative.9Having introduced the duality index and studied its properties. We will consider a portfolio selection problem under the duality index in this section.An agent in the market is going to find an outcome X to(4)minXR(u(X-ℓ))s.t.E[ρX]=x,X∈L1,where the utility functionu:R↦Rof the agent is concave, strictly increasing, and differentiable withu(0)=0; the random variableρ>0is the market price of risk or pricing kernel with mean value 1; the constantℓis the benchmark or reference point of the agent,10For simplicity, we consider deterministic benchmark only. There is difficulty to generalize to random case.10which is typically larger than the initial endowment x; and the set of possible outcomes is defined asL1={X∈L:E[∣X∣]<+∞}.We assume thatE[ρln(ρ)]<+∞andE[ln(ρ)]>-∞.11In the Black–Scholes, or Merton models,ρis lognormal distributed. In this case, this assumption holds true.11Note thatE[ρln(ρ)]>E[ρ]ln(E[ρ])=0andE[ln(ρ)]<ln(E[ρ])=0by the Jensen’s inequality.12Throughout this paper, we assumeρis not a constant if not elsewhere specified.12The constraintE[ρX]=xis often called the budget constraint and limits the choice of a particular hedging strategy as attainable or replicable given an initial endowment x. In this paper, we assume the market is complete, that is to say, any outcomeX∈L1can be replicated. However, we do not study here how to replicate an outcome. Interested readers can consult Pardoux and Peng (1990) for an analysis of related topics.It may be observed that people tend to think of possible outcomes relative to a benchmark or reference point rather than the absolute outcomes themselves. This phenomenon is called the framing effect. So we consider the relative outcomeX-ℓinstead of the absolute outcome X in the target. It turns out that the benchmark plays an essential role in the problem.A risk-averse agent tends to derive less utility from consuming additional units of the same product. This phenomenon is called the law of diminishing marginal utility and is reflected by the concavity of the utility function in the target. If the agent is risk-neutral, then the utility function is just the identical function, and we will discuss it as an example later.LetY=X-ℓ. Then we can rewrite problem (4) as(5)infYR(u(Y))s.t.E[ρY]=-y,Y∈L1,wherey=ℓ-xis called the surplus level. We investigate this problem instead of problem (4). The optimal value of problem (5) is defined asV(y). It is clear thatV(y)=0whenevery⩽0becauseY=-y⩾0is a feasible solution andR(u(Y))=0. In this case, the agent’s benchmark is too low, so he/she can achieve it without any risk at all.From now on, we focus on the casey>0.Let us first study the well-posedness issue (whether or not the value is finite) of problem (5).Proposition 4.1The value of problem(5)is finite if and only if the set(6)Sy={Y∈L1:E[ρY]=-y,u(Y)∈A}is not empty. Moreover, if the value of problem(5)is finite, then the optimal solution, if it exists, must belong toSy.“⇒”: The value is finite, so there isY∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-y,u(Y)∈A∪B. Ifu(Y)∈B, thenY⩾0a.s.,E[ρY]⩾0>-y, a contradiction. This also confirms that the setSyis not empty and the optimal solution, if it exists, must belong toSy.“⇐”: This is evident.□Now we study the setSy. The conditionu(Y)∈Ais not so easy to justify, so we want to find a more easily justified replacement. Let us consider the following set(7)Sˆy={Y∈L1:E[ρY]=-y,E[u(Y)]>0}.The setSˆyis not so hard to analyze. It is related to the classic Merton’s optimum consumption model (Merton, 1971).Lemma 4.2Define(8)yˆ=sup{y:thereisY∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-yandE[u(Y)]>0}.Then the setSˆyis not empty if and only ify<yˆ.It is clear thatyˆ⩾0because whenevery<0,Y=-y∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-yandE[u(Y)]>0. The value ofyˆis not so hard to derive in general cases. Let us look at two most important and widely used cases.Example 4.1Ifu(·)is linear, thenyˆ=+∞.13Here we assume thatessinfρ=0. For example,ρis lognormal distributed. In general case,yˆ=1/essinfρ.13Ifu(·)is strictly concave, thenyˆ=-limλ→λˆ+Eρ(u′)-1λρ, where(9)λˆ=supλ>0:Eu(u′)-1λρ>0.The setSyis not empty if and only ify<yˆ.Putting all of the results obtained thus far together, we can solve the well-posedness issue of problem (5) completely.Theorem 4.4The value of problem(5)is finite if and only ify<yˆ, whereyˆis given by(8). Moreover, wheny<yˆ, the optimal solution of problem(5), if it exists, must belong toSy, whereSyis given by(6).Ify⩾yˆoryˆ=0, then the value of problem (5) and that of the original problem (4) are both infinity. That is to say, if the benchmark levelℓcompared to the initial endowment x is too aggressive, then the investment risk will be beyond any agent’s tolerance. By contrast, in the classic mean–variance model, some agents may enter the market regardless of the benchmark level because the investment risk will still be lower than his/her tolerance.In the following part, we look for the optimal solution of problem (5). From now on, we assume0<y<yˆ.The main difficulty in solving problem (5) is due to the nonlinearity of the duality index. To overcome this, we introduce a series of problems and study their relationships. Eventually, we link problem (5) to a solvable classic portfolio selection problem, and then deduce its optimal solution and optimal value. It will be seen that Basic Lemma plays a key role in this approach.Before introducing a new series of problems, we firstly need to analyze the value function of problem (5).Lemma 4.5The value functionV(·)of problem(5)is finite, increasing and convex on[0,yˆ).By the convexity of the value function, we obtain thatCorollary 4.6The value functionV(·)is continuous on[0,yˆ).14In fact,V(·)is convex on(-∞,yˆ), soV(·)is continuous on(-∞,yˆ). In particular,V(0)=0.14From the above result, it can be seen that if the benchmark levelℓis very close to the initial endowment x, then the risk can be arbitrarily small. In other words, if an agent is not greedy, then he/she can set a benchmark level which brings the investment risk within his/her level of tolerance (no matter how small it is, provided it is not zero). That is to say, he/she will enter the market. By contrast, in the classic mean–variance model without a risk-free asset, there is a so-called system risk which is positive. If the system risk is beyond the agent’s risk tolerance, then no matter how small the benchmark level is, he/she will not enter the market.It is clear that the duality index in the target of problem (5) is not easy to deal with. To avoid this, we introduce a bridge problem(10)sup(α,Y)αs.t.E[e-αu(Y)]⩽1,E[ρY]=-y,Y∈L1.Our novel approach is based on the following result which suggests the relationships between the above problem and problem (5).Proposition 4.7Fixy∈(0,yˆ). A pair(α∗,Y∗)is an optimal solution to problem(10)if and only ifY∗is an optimal solution to problem(5)and0<α∗=1/R(u(Y∗))<+∞.The above result links problem (5) to problem (10). We now only need to consider the latter. Problem (10) is significantly simpler than problem (5) since the duality index has been removed. However, there are still two variables that need to be optimized in problem (10), and it may not be easy to find the optimal solution directly because the feasible set may not be convex and the standard Lagrange method cannot be applied directly. Our second novel idea is therefore to introduce a new series of single-variable optimization problems which are easier to solve but still closely linked with the bridge problem (10) and therefore also with problem (5).Fixy∈(0,yˆ). Define a series of single-variable optimization problems parameterized byα>0.(11)Pα:infYE[e-αu(Y)]s.t.E[ρY]=-y,Y∈L1.This is a Merton’s optimum consumption-like problem, in which the value of absolute risk aversionαis given as a priori.Denote the value of the above problem asVP(α)which is clearly nonnegative and finite, sinceY=-yis a feasible solution of it with a finite value. For the convenience of notation,VP(0)is naturally defined as 1.Before studying problemPα, we need some preparations. For everyα>0, the mappingx↦e-αu(x)is strictly convex and decreasing onR, so its derivativex↦-αu′(x)e-αu(x)is a one to one increasing mapping fromRto(-∞,0). LetIα(·)denote the inverse of the mappingx↦-αu′(x)e-αu(x). ThenIα(·)is a one to one increasing mapping from(-∞,0)toR.Assumption 4.1For eachα>0,ρIαλρ∈L1andIαλρ∈L1, wheneverλ∈(-∞,0).15This assumption may be replaced by a weaker one.15The behaviors ofE[ρIαλρ]andE[Iαλρ]are very complicated. We refer interested readers to Jin, Xu, and Zhou (2008) for a complete study of a similar problem.Example 4.3Ifu(x)=x. ThenIα(x)=-α-1ln(-α-1x). Assumption 4.1 is satisfied.Now we turn to solve problemPα. The complete solution is given below.Proposition 4.8Fixy∈(0,yˆ). For eachα>0, problemPαadmits a unique solution(12)Yα=Iαλρ,whereλ∈(-∞,0)is the root ofE[ρIαλρ]=-y.Moreover, the optimal value of problemPαis given byVP(α)=E[e-αu(Yα)].Although problemPαis completely solved in the above proposition, its relationship to problem (10) needs to be ascertained.To answer this question, we need to study the properties ofVP(·). The first one is the continuity property ofVP(·)which will be proved through its convexity.Lemma 4.9Fixy∈(0,yˆ). The value functionVP(·)is convex on[0,∞).The functionVP(·)is nonnegative, finite and continuous on(0,∞).The next result is dedicated to showing that the value functionVP(·)is strictly less than 1 near 0.Lemma 4.11Fixy∈(0,yˆ). There isαˆ>0such thatVP(α)<1whenever0<α<αˆ.From the above lemma,VP(0+)⩽1=VP(0). It is natural to ask whetherVP(·)is continuous at 0. The answer is not true in general. This is very different from the answer to the value functionV(·)of problem (5). See the example in the following section.We have the following important byproduct.Corollary 4.12The equationVP(α)=1admits at most one positive solution.The following result shows that the value functionVP(·)can be arbitrary large.Lemma 4.13For eachα>0,VP(α)⩾eαu′(0)y-E[ρln(ρ)].SinceVP(α)is less than 1 whenαis close to zero and bigger than 1 whenα>yu′(0)E[ρln(ρ)], so by the concavity, we conclude that.Corollary 4.14The equationVP(α)=1admits a unique positive solution.Now we are ready to reveal the relationship between problemPαand problem (10).Proposition 4.15Fixy∈(0,yˆ). SupposeVP(α∗)=1for someα∗>0. LetY∗be the optimal solution to problemPα∗. Then the pair(α∗,Y∗)is an optimal solution to problem(10).SinceVP(α∗)=1,(α∗,Y∗)is a feasible solution of problem (10). Suppose it is not optimal. Then there is a pair(α,Y)satisfyingE[e-αu(Y)]⩽1,E[ρY]=-y,Y∈L1, andα>α∗>0. This Y is a feasible solution of problemPα, soVP(α)⩽E[e-αu(Y)]⩽1. On the other hand, by the convexity ofVP(·),1=VP(α∗)⩽α-α∗αVP(0+)+α∗αVP(α)⩽α-α∗α+α∗αVP(α),1⩽VP(α).SoVP(α)=1. ThatVP(α)=VP(α∗)=1contradicts the claim of Corollary 4.12.□Putting all of the results obtained thus far together, we obtain the complete solution of problem (5).Theorem 4.16Fixy∈(0,yˆ). ThenVP(α)=E[e-αu(Yα)]=1admits a unique positive solutionα∗>0, whereYαis given by(12). Moreover,(α∗,Yα∗)is an optimal solution to problem(10), andYα∗is an optimal solution to problem(5)with the optimal value1/α∗, and0<α∗⩽E[ρln(ρ)]yu′(0).The optimal value of problem (5) is lower bounded byyu′(0)E[ρln(ρ)], which is increasing in y. According to Lemma 4.5, the bigger the surplus level, the higher the investment risk; the growth rate by the above result is also at leastu′(0)E[ρln(ρ)]. If the surplus level is too large, or to be more precise, is larger thanyˆ, then no risk-averse agent will enter the market.In this section, we present two important examples to illustrate the main result of this paper.Example 4.4Risk-neutral agent. In this case,u(x)=xandyˆ=+∞.16Here we assume thatessinfρ=0.16ThenIα(x)=-1αln(-xα). The optimal solution to problemPαisIα(λρ)=-y+1α(E[ρln(ρ)]-ln(ρ))and optimal value isVP(α)=E[e-αu(Iα(λρ))]=eαy-E[ρln(ρ)]. FromVP(α∗)=1, we obtainα∗=E[ρln(ρ)]/y>0. The optimal solution to problem (5) is-ln(ρ)yE[ρln(ρ)]and the optimal value of problem (5) isV(y)=1/α∗=yE[ρln(ρ)], which is continuous on[0,∞). However, the value functionVP(·)is not continuous at 0 sinceVP(0+)=e-E[ρln(ρ)]<1=VP(0). In this case, the investment risk is proportional to the surplus level.Risk-averse agent. Letu(x)=1-e-βx,β>0andln(ρ)be normally distributed with meanμand varianceσ2. Then we deduceμ=-12σ2fromE[ρ]=1. It is not hard to deriveyˆ=σ22β. In this case,Iα(·)is the unique function satisfyingαe-βIα(x)-βIα(x)=α+ln(-x)-ln(α)-ln(β). LetW(·)be the Lambert function, which is the unique function satisfyingW(x)eW(x)=xon[0,+∞). ThenIα(x)=1β(W(-xβeα)-ln(-xβeα)+ln(α)). The following picture shows the relationship between the risk and surplus level.Whereσ2=β=1. From the picture, it can be seen that the risk will go to infinity as the surplus level y goes toyˆ=σ22β=0.5, and to 0 as y to 0.The more risk-averse (i.e., the bigger theβ) the agent, the less (i.e., the smaller theyˆ) his/her risk tolerance.In this paper, a nontrivial, nonnegative, real-valued index for general outcomes is defined. It is a generalization of the index introduced by Aumann and Serrano (2008). It retains many properties of the original index including sub-additivity, law-invariance, convexity and monotonicity as well as continuity. It is also the unique nontrivial index that satisfies both the duality and positive homogeneity axioms.A portfolio selection problem is then considered in a complete market setting. The problem is completely solved by linking it to a series of Merton’s optimum consumption-like problems via a bridge problem. The problem is equivalent to one of the series, which is revealed by an explicit algebraic equation.In an incomplete market setting, the problem will be much harder to tackle and a new method needs to be adopted. Optimal stopping problem under the duality index is also interesting. These problems will be addressed in the forthcoming papers.By the monotonic convergence theorem, we havelimα→αˆ-E[eαX-1{X<0}]=E[eαˆX-1{X<0}],and by the dominated convergence theorem, we havelimα→αˆ-E[e-αX+1{X⩾0}]=E[e-αˆX+1{X⩾0}].Adding them up, noticing the definition ofαˆ, we obtain(13)1⩾liminfα→αˆ-E[e-αX]=E[e-αˆX].IfP(X≠0)>0, setf(α)=E[e-αX]. Thenf(·)on[0,αˆ]is a strictly convex function satisfyingf(0)=1,f(αˆ)⩽1. Therefore,f(α)<αˆ-ααˆf(0)+ααˆf(αˆ)⩽1, whenever0<α<αˆ. Since every convex function is continuous in the interior of its domain, we obtain thatf(·)is continuous on(0,αˆ). By (13), we see thatf(·)is continuous atαˆtoo. By the definition ofαˆ, we have thatE[e-αX]>1wheneverα>αˆ.IfX∈A, thenαˆ>0by the definition ofM. We also have thatαˆ<+∞. OtherwiseE[e-αˆX]⩾E[e+∞1{X<0}]=+∞.IfX∈B, thenαˆ=+∞by the definition.Supposeαˆ>0for someX∈C. Then by the convexity off(·), we have, for everyα>0,f(α)-f(0)α-0⩾f′(0+)=-E[X]⩾0, which contradictsf(α)=E[e-αX]<1whenever0<α<αˆ. We conclude thatαˆ=0for everyX∈C.IfX∈D, thenE[X-]=+∞. SoX∉Msince all the moments ofX-are finite whenX∈M. Therefore,E[e-αX]=+∞for allα>0andαˆ=0by the definition.Thatf(·)is continuous at 0 wheneverαˆ>0can be proved by the same idea as proving (13).The proof is very similar to that in Aumann and Serrano (2008). However, our definition of the duality index is different from the original one. So we give the proof here.1.If one of X and Y belongsC∪D, thenR(X)+R(Y)=+∞⩾R(X+Y)(which is defined as+∞wheneverX+Y∉L). If one of X and Y belongs toB, say Y. ThenX+Y⩾Xalmost surely (a.s.). By the monotonic property which will be proved below, we haveR(X+Y)⩽R(X)=R(X)+R(Y). Now suppose both X and Y belong toA. Letα1=sup{α⩾0:E[e-αX]⩽1}andα2=sup{α⩾0:E[e-αY]⩽1}. Then0<α1,α2<+∞. Setk=α2α1+α2∈(0,1). Thenα1α2α1+α2(X+Y)=kα1X+(1-k)α2Y. By the convexity of the exponential function, we haveE[e-α1α2α1+α2(X+Y)]=E[e-kα1X-(1-k)α2Y]⩽kE[e-α1X]+(1-k)E[e-α2Y]⩽1. By the definition of the duality index,R(X+Y)⩽α1+α2α1α2=α1-1+α2-1=R(X)+R(Y).This follows immediately from the definition.This follows from the above two properties.This is evident.Because the duality index is law-invariant, it is sufficient to prove the second-order case. Suppose Y second-order stochastic dominates X. Then for eachα>0, the mappingx↦e-αxis decreasing and convex, soE[e-αY]⩽E[e-αX]. Therefore,sup{α⩾0:E[e-αX]⩽1}⩽sup{α⩾0:E[e-αY]⩽1}. By the definition of the duality index, we haveR(X)⩾R(Y).For eachα⩾0, by the monotonic convergence theorem, we havelimn→+∞E[eαXn-1{X⩽0}]=E[eαX-1{X⩽0}]andlimn→+∞E[e-αXn+1{X>0}]=E[e-αX+1{X>0}]. Adding them up, we obtain thatlimn→+∞E[e-αXn]=E[e-αX]. This confirms thatlimn→+∞R(Xn)=R(X).Similarly, by the monotonic convergence theorem, we havelimn→+∞E[u(w+Xn+)1{X>0}]=E[u(w+X)1{X>0}]andlimn→+∞E[u(w-Xn-)1{X⩽0}]=E[u(w+X)1{X⩽0}]. Adding them up, we obtain thatlimn→+∞E[u(w+Xn)]=E[u(w+X)].Since the duality index defined in Definition 2.1 coincides with that in Aumann and Serrano (2008) for all bounded outcomes, it also satisfies the duality axiom for all bounded outcomes.Assume that the utility functions of two agents A and B areuA(·)anduB(·), respectively, and the agent A is uniformly more risk-averse than agent B. Suppose that the agent A accepts an outcomeX∈Lat some wealthw0, i.e., eitherX=0a.s. orE[uA(w0+X)]>uA(w0). We need to prove that the agent B accepts any outcomeY∈LsatisfyingR(Y)<R(X)at any wealth w, that is to say, eitherY=0a.s. orE[uB(w+Y)]>uB(w).SinceR(Y)<R(X)⩽+∞,Y∈A∪B. IfY=0, then it is accepted. IfY∈B-{0}, thenY⩾0a.s.,E[uB(w+Y)]>uB(w)and it is accepted too.Now fixY∈Aandw∈R. DefineYε=Y-ε1{Y>0}, for everyε>0. Then for eachα>0such thatE[e-αY]<1, we havelimε→0+E[e-αYε]=E[e-αY]<1. So we conclude thatlimε→0+R(Yε)⩽R(Y)<R(X). Let us fix anε>0such thatR(Yε)<R(X).LetXn=min{max{X,-n},n}andYn=min{max{Yε,-n},n}. Then by Lemma 2.6,limn→+∞R(Yn)=R(Yε)<R(X)=limn→+∞R(Xn). SoR(Yn)<R(Xn)for every large n. On the other hand, by Lemma 2.6,limn→+∞E[uA(w0+Xn)]=E[uA(w0+X)]>u(w0), so the agent A acceptsXnat wealthw0for every large n. BothXnandYnare bounded, so the agent B acceptsYnat any wealth w, that isE[uB(w+Yn)]>uB(w)for every large n. Applying Lemma 2.6 again,E[uB(w+Yε)]=limn→+∞E[uB(w+Yn)]⩾uB(w). SinceY∈A,P(Y>0)>0,E[uB(w+Y)]>E[uB(w+Y-ε1{Y>0})]=E[uB(w+Yε)]⩾uB(w). That is to say, the agent B accepts Y at wealth w. Now we proved that the duality index satisfies the duality axiom.It is evident that the duality index satisfies the positive homogeneity axiom.The uniqueness of the index can be proved by a similar limit argument. We leave the proof to interested readers.SupposeSˆyis not empty, then there isY∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-yandE[u(Y)]>0. Then for anyy′<y, we haveY+y-y′∈L1,E[ρ(Y+y-y′)]=-y′, andE[u(Y+y-y′)]⩾E[u(Y)]>0. This indicates that the setSˆy′is not empty. By the definition ofyˆ, we conclude that the setSˆyis not empty whenevery<yˆ.It is evident that the setSˆyis empty whenevery>yˆby the definition ofyˆ.We only need to prove thatSˆyˆis empty wheneveryˆ<+∞. Suppose not, then there isY∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-yˆandE[u(Y)]>0. LetYε=Y-ε1{Y>0}. By the monotonic convergence theorem,limε→0+E[u(Yε)1{Y>0}]=E[u(Y)1{Y>0}]⩾0. It is evident thatE[u(Yε)1{Y⩽0}]=E[u(Y)1{Y⩽0}]>-∞sinceE[u(Y)]>0. Adding them up, we obtainlimε→0+E[u(Yε)]=E[u(Y)]>0. Thus, there isε>0such thatE[u(Yε)]>0. Setδ=εE[ρ1{Y>0}]⩾0. Ifδ=0, thenY⩽0a.s. andE[u(Y)]⩽0, a contradiction. Soδ>0. SinceE[ρYε]=E[ρY]-εE[ρ1{Y>0}]=-yˆ-δ<-yˆ, we have thatYε∈Sˆyˆ+δwhich contradicts the definition ofyˆ. The proof is complete.Supposey<yˆ. Letε>0such thaty+ε<yˆ. Then by Lemma 4.2,Sˆy+εis not empty, so there isY∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-(y+ε)andE[u(Y)]>0. LetYn=max{Y,-n}. SinceY⩽Yn⩽Y+, by the monotonic convergence theorem,limn→+∞E[ρYn]=E[ρY]=-(y+ε)<-yandlimn→+∞E[u(Yn)]=E[u(Y)]>0. Therefore, we haveE[ρYn]<-yandE[u(Yn)]>0for large n. Letδ>0satisfyE[ρ(Yn+δ)]=-y. It is very easy to verify thatYn+δbelongs to the setSy. So the setSyis not empty.For everyy⩾yˆ, by Lemma 4.2,Sˆyis empty. Because the setSyis a subset ofSˆy, so it is empty as well.Lety1<y2<yˆ. For any two outcomesY1,Y2∈L1satisfyingE[ρY1]=-y1,E[ρY2]=-y2and any constantk∈(0,1), by the concavity ofu(·),u(kY1+(1-k)Y2)⩾ku(Y1)+(1-k)u(Y2).Because the duality index is monotonically decreasing w.r.t. the first-order dominance and convex,R(u(kY1+(1-k)Y2))⩽R(ku(Y1)+(1-k)u(Y2))⩽kR(u(Y1))+(1-k)R(u(Y2)),which implies thatV(ky1+(1-k)y2)⩽kV(y1)+(1-k)V(y2).The monotonically increasing ofV(·)is due to the fact that the duality index is monotonically decreasing w.r.t. the first-order dominance. ThatV(·)is finite on[0,yˆ)is due to Theorem 4.4.“⇒”: We first prove that0<α∗<+∞, then by the definition of the duality index,α∗=1/R(u(Y∗))follows immediately. Sincey∈(0,yˆ), the setSyis not empty, so there isY∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-yandu(Y)∈A. Then0<R(u(Y))<+∞. Since(1/R(u(Y)),Y)is a feasible solution of problem (10),α∗⩾1/R(u(Y))>0. On the other hand, ifα∗=+∞, then1⩾E[e-α∗u(Y∗)]⩾+∞∗P(Y∗<0), soP(Y∗<0)=0,E[ρY∗]⩾0>-y, a contradiction.Next we prove thatY∗is an optimal solution to problem (5). Otherwise, there isY∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-yandR(u(Y))<R(u(Y∗)). Thenu(Y)∈A∪B. Sinceu(Y)∈Bimplies thatY⩾0a.s. andE[ρY]⩾0>-y, we conclude thatu(Y)∈Aand so0<R(u(Y))<+∞. Then the pair(1/R(u(Y)),Y)is a feasible solution of problem (10) and1/R(u(Y))>1/R(u(Y∗))=α∗, which contradicts the optimality of(α∗,Y∗)to problem (10).“⇐”: SupposeY∗is an optimal solution to problem (5). Sincey∈(0,yˆ), the optimal valueR(u(Y∗))<+∞. SinceR(u(Y∗))=0leads toY∗⩾0a.s. andE[ρY∗]⩾0>-y, a contradiction, we conclude that0<R(u(Y∗))<+∞. Then(1/R(u(Y∗)),Y∗)is a feasible solution to problem (10). Suppose it is not optimal. Then there is a pair(α,Y)satisfyingY∈L1,E[e-αu(Y)]⩽1,E[ρY]=-yandα>1/R(u(Y∗))>0. Then Y is a feasible solution of problem (5), butR(u(Y))⩽1/α<R(u(Y∗)), which contradicts the optimality ofY∗to problem (5).By the monotonic convergence theorem, the mappingλ↦E[ρIαλρ]is continuous and increasing on(-∞,0)andlimλ→-∞EρIαλρ=Elimλ→-∞ρIαλρ=-∞,limλ→0-EρIαλρ=Elimλ→0-ρIαλρ=+∞,soE[ρIαλρ]=-yadmits a negative solution.The optimality of (12) can be shown by the standard Lagrange method. We leave the proof to interested readers.Letα>α′⩾0be two scalars, and Y,Y′be the corresponding feasible solutions of problemPαandPα′, respectively. Then for anyk∈(0,1), by the convexity, monotonicity of exponential function, and the concavity ofu(·),kEe-αu(Y)+(1-k)Ee-α′u(Y′)=Eke-αu(Y)+(1-k)e-α′u(Y′)⩾Ee-kαu(Y)-(1-k)α′u(Y′)=Ee-(kα+(1-k)α′)(βu(Y)+(1-β)u(Y′))⩾Ee-(kα+(1-k)α′)(u(βY+(1-β)Y′))⩾VP(kα+(1-k)α′),whereβ=kαkα+(1-k)α′∈(0,1]. The convexity ofVP(·)on[0,∞)is established.By Proposition 4.1,Syis not empty, so there isY∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-y, andu(Y)∈A. By Basic Lemma, there isαˆ>0such thatVP(α)⩽E[e-αu(Y)]<1whenever0<α<αˆ.Suppose thatVP(α′)=VP(α″)=1for someα″>α′>0. By Lemma 4.11, there is0<α<α′such thatVP(α)<1. By the convexity ofVP(·), we deduce that1=VP(α′)⩽α″-α′α″-αVP(α)+α′-αα″-αVP(α″)<1.This confirms our claim.We first consider the following probleminfYE[e-αu′(0)Y]s.t.E[ρY]=-y.The standard Lagrange method gives the optimal solutionY∗=-y+1αu′(0)(E[ρln(ρ)]-ln(ρ)), and optimal valueE[e-αu′(0)Y∗]=eαu′(0)y-E[ρln(ρ)].Becauseu(·)is concave andu(0)=0, we have thatu(x)⩽u′(0)xfor allx∈R. Therefore, for eachα>0andY∈L1satisfyingE[ρY]=-y, we haveE[e-αu(Y)]⩾E[e-αu′(0)Y]⩾E[e-αu′(0)Y∗]=eαu′(0)y-E[ρln(ρ)].The claim follows immediately.
