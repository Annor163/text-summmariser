@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundGene name recognition and normalization is, together with detection of other named entities, a crucial step in biomedical text mining and the underlying basis for development of more advanced techniques like extraction of complex events. While the current state of the art solutions achieve highly promising results on average, performance can drop significantly for specific genes with highly ambiguous synonyms. Depending on the topic of interest, this can cause the need for extensive manual curation of such text mining results. Our goal was to enhance this curation step based on tools widely used in pharmaceutical industry utilizing the text processing and classification capabilities of the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) along with publicly available sources.ResultsF-score achieved on gene specific test corpora for highly ambiguous genes could be improved from values close to zero, due to very low precision, to values >0.9 for several cases. Interestingly the presented approach even resulted in an increased F-score for genes showing already good results in initial gene name normalization. For most test cases, we could significantly improve precision, while retaining a high recall.ConclusionsWe could show that KNIME can be used to assist in manual curation of text mining results containing high numbers of false positive hits. Our results also indicate that it could be beneficial for future development in the field of gene name normalization to create gene specific training corpora based on incorrectly identified genes common to current state of the art algorithms.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We could show that KNIME and its recently added text processing capabilities can be used to drastically reduce the number of false positive hits for gene name normalization after possible hits had been narrowed down to a smaller set of genes. The presented workflow should be particularly helpful for usually problematic gene names causing many false positive hits due to ambiguous acronyms. Even if the secondary classification step fails, the initial processing step comprising acronym expansion and dictionary matching, can help to reduce the size of the remaining dataset that has to be curated manually. Thus, this approach can be a time saver in manual curation tasks or might even reveal interesting information that might have been ignored otherwise due to being obfuscated in a huge number of false positive hits, as shown for the example SAH. This study also demonstrates that it could be helpful for the further development of algorithms for gene name normalization to use current state of the art approaches in order to identify common errors and setup solutions to specifically deal with these issues. Our automated curation approach could also be helpful in the easier creation of such novel training data sets.Matthias Zwick is an employee of Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.
