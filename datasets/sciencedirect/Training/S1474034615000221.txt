@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Design concept evaluation at the early stage of product design has been widely recognized as one of the most critical phases in new product development as it determines the direction of the downstream design activities. However, the information at this stage is mainly subjective and imprecise which only depends on experts’ judgments. How to handle the vagueness and subjectivity in design concept evaluation becomes a critical issue. This paper presents a systematic evaluation method by integrating rough number based analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and rough number based compromise ranking method (also known as VIKOR) to evaluate design concepts under subjective environment. In this study, rough number is introduced to aggregate individual judgments and preferences and deal with the vagueness in decision-making. A novel AHP based on rough number is presented to determine the weight of each evaluation criterion. Then an improved rough number based VIKOR is proposed to evaluate the design concept alternatives. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to measure the impact of the decision makers’ risk to the final evaluation results. Finally, a practical example is put forward to validate the performance of the proposed method. The result shows that the proposed decision-making method can effectively enhance the objectivity in design concept evaluation under subjective environment.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
New product development (NPD) has been considered as one of the corporate key functions and a critical factor to maintain competitiveness in a fast-growing global market under highly competitive environment [19,23]. The rapid advances in technology, fast changing customer needs, combined with increasing market competition force the companies to develop new product with shorter time, lower cost and higher quality [34]. However, it is a process involving uncertainty and risk. To resolve the stochastic problem and ensure the success of the product development, people should take into account these factors and constraints as early as possible and make accurate decisions. A bad selection of final design concept for a particular product may not only increase the development cost, but also cause additional modification or even endanger the success of the overall NPD. It is reported that up to 70–80% of the whole product development cost is determined at early design stage [29]. In addition, the deficiencies at this stage can hardly be compensated in the subsequent design process. Due to its important role on the consequent design activities, the final design concept evaluation in the early product development is perhaps the most crucial stage among NPD.Generally, design concept evaluation is a complex multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem which concerns many factors ranging from customer needs to constraints and resources of the enterprise [47,14]. At the same time, it is also a group decision-making; many experts are invited to implement the final performance evaluation. The data and information in the decision-making process are usually subjective and imprecise, which can only rely on experts’ subjective judgments. It ranges from individual judgments to methods that aggregate and rank these alternatives [38]. How to effectively and objectively aggregate individual judgments to evaluate the design concepts under such subjective environment at the early stage of NPD becomes a critical issue and a hot topic among researchers.This paper aims to propose a systematic approach to manipulate the vagueness and subjectivity to enhance the objectivity in design concept evaluation by combining with rough number, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and compromise ranking method (also known as VIKOR). Rough number is introduced to aggregate individual judgments and priorities and handle the vagueness in decision-making process. Then a rough number based AHP (rough AHP) is developed to calculate criteria weights and a rough number based VIKOR (rough VIKOR) is presented to evaluate design concept alternatives.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the brief review and background. The rough number based approach is proposed in Section 3. Section 4 presents a case study. Section 5 draws the conclusion.Due to its important and fundamental role in NPD, design concept evaluation is an attractive topic among researchers in decision-making. Various decision-making methods have conducted to select the best alternatives among design concepts. Calantone et al. [9] discussed the usefulness of the AHP in knowledge acquisition and management, and used it as a decision support tool to assist managers in new product ideas screening. To address the variety of interactions and dependencies in conceptual design alternative evaluation, Ayağ and Özdemir [5] presented an analytic network process (ANP) based methodology to select the best concept to satisfy the expectations of both company and customers. Meanwhile, many integrated methods were developed. Ayağ [4] integrated AHP and simulation analysis in design concept selection in a NPD environment. AHP was adopted to evaluate concept design alternatives while simulation analysis was used to carry out further economic analysis, and finally the best design concept alternatives were determined by a final benefit/cost analysis. Lin et al. [27] proposed an integrated AHP and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) to assist the process of customer-driven product design. AHP was applied to determine the weights of customer needs and design characteristics while TOPSIS was adopted to execute competitive benchmarking in design alternative evaluation. Takai and Ishii [40] integrated target costing and perception-based concept evaluation approach for complex and large-scale systems. The method decomposed the QFD (Quality Function Deployment) matrices simultaneously for structure and their requirements, and evaluated concepts with regard to target requirements and cost. Besharati et al. [8] presented a generalized purchase model that accounts for market demand, designers’ preferences and uncertainty associated with design attribute levels. Based on the customer-based utility metric, a decision support system was developed for product design selection.However, most of the information in design concept evaluation comes from experts’ subjective judgments, which are imprecise, vague or even inconsistent. The simple crisp pair-wise comparison with conventional decision-making approach is unable to capture the true perception of the decision maker effectively and precisely. In order to manipulate the vagueness and uncertainty in decision-making, some researchers introduced fuzzy logic into decision-making algorithm and developed various fuzzy sets based decision-making methods. Ayağ [3] integrated fuzzy AHP and simulation technique to assist concept selection. A fuzzy AHP was employed to reduce candidate concepts while simulation analysis was introduced to evaluate the rest ones. Finally, a further preference ratio analysis was conducted to determine the final design alternative. To compensate the deficiency of conventional AHP in addressing the variety of interactions and dependencies in decision-making, Ayağ and Özdemir [6] extended the pair-wise comparison in ANP with fuzzy sets and presented a fuzzy ANP model to evaluate conceptual design alternatives. Vanegas and Labib [42] suggested a novel approach to handle fuzzy sets and calculate desirability levels through a new fuzzy-weighted average in engineering design evaluation. Vanegas and Labib [43] presented a survey of several fuzzy methods in engineering design evaluation. They posed two metrics for determining performance levels and suggested a new fuzzy goal and a novel method of measuring design candidates by computing an aggregate fuzzy set. Wang [44] developed an improved design concept evaluation model by combining with fuzzy sets and Pugh’s concept selection approach, which can not only evaluate the candidate concepts but also aid designers for further promoting the concepts under evaluation. Kahraman et al. [23] proposed an integrated method with two phases to promote the quality of new product alternatives selection by combining with fuzzy sets, TOPSIS and heuristic multi-attribute utility approach. Malekly et al. [28] stated an integrated optimization-based approach for conceptual bridge design evaluation by combining QFD and TOPSIS under fuzzy environment. To strengthen the effectiveness of design alternative evaluation in complex product development, Zhang and Chu [50] attempted to integrate QFD, group decision-making and fuzzy sets, and developed a new model.The intention of the fuzzy valued evaluation technique is to transform crisp numbers into fuzzy ones with the aid of membership function to deal with the vagueness in decision-making. However, the selection of membership function in fuzzy sets is mainly depending on subjective judgment. In addition, the boundary of fuzzy set is difficult to determine accurately.Consider the deficiency of fuzzy sets in dealing with the vagueness in decision-making, some researchers introduced interval arithmetic and developed many hybrid methods. To optimize the decision-making process of NPD assessment under complex multi-attribute environment, Chin et al. [12] developed a novel evidential reasoning interval based method, which can effectively address uncertain and incomplete data, and information in various types. Guo et al. [16] further enhanced the evidential reasoning under both fuzzy and interval environment. Akay et al. [2] extended fuzzy information axiom with interval type-2 fuzzy sets and developed a novel concept selection approach known as interval-type-2 fuzzy information axiom. Sayadi et al. [37] integrated VIKOR with interval numbers for decision-making while Vahdani et al. [41] further introduced interval-valued fuzzy sets in VIKOR. Furthermore, Kuo and Liang [24] presented a new integrated interval-valued fuzzy sets and VIKOR. Park et al. [32] extended VIKOR with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information for group decision-making. Chen and Tsao [11] combined with interval-valued fuzzy sets and TOPSIS while Park et al. [33] further extended TOPSIS with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets.Likewise, the basic idea of interval based decision-making algorithm is to use interval number to represent decision information, many approaches may also integrate with fuzzy sets. However, the interval boundary is also difficult to determine and involving subjectivity.Furthermore, as a famous method in dealing with uncertain information system, rough set and its variant models are also applied in decision-making. Xie et al. [45] combined with variable precision rough set and AHP for group decision-making. The integrated model was mainly used to calculate the weights of attributes. Guo and Zhang [15] integrated VIKOR and rough set theory in supplier selection. Rough set was employed to calculate relative importance and VIKOR was adopted to rank candidate suppliers. Aydogan [7] presented a hybrid rough-AHP and TOPSIS methods for Turkish aviation firms’ performance measurement under fuzzy environment. Rough set was adopted to reduce evaluation bias in pair-wise comparison process of AHP in criteria weighting. Li et al. [26] proposed an integrated model by combining with Kano’s model, rough set and AHP to rank customer requirements’ importance. Rough set was used to identify customer requirements and simplify the decision system. Besides, rough set was also used in the rule mining in decision-making. Chang and Hung [10] and Zou et al. [51] introduced rough set in supplier selection by using them in rule mining. Li et al. [25] posed a grey-based rough decision-making method. Rough set was adopted in the knowledge discovery and data mining. In a word, the rough set in rough set based methods was mainly used in criteria weighting or rules mining to eliminate bias. The entire decision-making process was separated and only part of them was taken into consideration. Therefore, much vagueness in the whole process was ignored.In addition, many other methods were introduced in decision-making and many new models were developed. Akay and Kulak [1] integrated information axiom, fuzzy sets and grey theory, and developed a grey-fuzzy information axiom to evaluate product concepts. Zhai et al. [47] combined with rough set and grey relation analysis and developed a rough-grey analysis model to optimize the design concept evaluation. Geng et al. [14] proposed a novel design concept evaluation method by integrating vague sets with TOPSIS. Huang et al. [17] presented a computational intelligence method to assist conceptual design. Fuzzy neural network was employed to implement concept evaluation. Moreover, several design selection methods were put forth by Huang et al. [18] to execute conceptual design evaluation under different conditions based on computational intelligence methods, such as physical programming, genetic algorithm, neural network and fuzzy logic. Song et al. [39] developed a novel rough group AHP and rough group TOPSIS to evaluate design concept under subjective environment. Jenab et al. [21] posed a multi-layer graph model to conduct conflict resolution among experts’ opinions and developed a fuzzy graph-based model to evaluate design concepts.In summary, the traditional fuzzy and interval based approaches cannot tackle the subjectivity in decision-making effectively. Most of the methods need to introduce much auxiliary information, such as predetermination of the membership function and the interval boundary, which are subjective as well. The rough set based algorithm can only address part of them, such as criteria weighting. Much of them were ignored. To resolve the dilemma, rough number is introduced to manipulate the subjectivity and vagueness in decision-making. It only relies on the data only, without any auxiliary numbers. Thus it can avoid the subjectivity at the most extent and measure the vagueness in various group decision-making areas. Not only can it be used in the determination of criteria weights, but also can it be adopted in the alternative ranking.Due to the subjectivity and group characteristics of the design concept evaluation, how to aggregate individual judgments and priorities from group experts and manage the subjectivity among them become urgent tasks. In this paper, rough number is introduced to handle these problems. Inspired by rough set theory, rough number is first proposed by Zhai et al. [46] with the purpose of handling subjective judgments of customers and determining the boundary intervals. A rough number usually contains lower limit, upper limit and the rough boundary interval, which only depends on the original data. Thus it does not require any auxiliary information and can better capture the experts’ real perception and improve the objectivity of the decision-making.Suppose U is the universe which contains all the objects, Y is an arbitrary object ofU,Ris a set of t classes (G1,G2,…,Gt) that cover all the objects inU,R={G1,G2,…,Gt}. If these classes are ordered asG1<G2<⋯<Gt, then∀Y∈U,Gq∈R,1⩽q⩽t, the lower approximation (Apr̲(Gq)), upper approximation (Apr‾(Gq)) and boundary region (Bnd(Gq)) of classGqare defined as:(1)Apr̲(Gq)=⋃{Y∈U/R(Y)⩽Gq}(2)Apr‾(Gq)=⋃{Y∈U/R(Y)⩾Gq}(3)Bnd(Gq)=⋃{Y∈U/R(Y)≠Gq}={Y∈U/R(Y)>Gq}⋃{Y∈U/R(Y)<Gq}ThenGqcan be represented by a rough number (RN(Gq)), which is determined by its corresponding lower limit (Lim̲(Gq)) and upper limit (Lim‾(Gq)), where(4)Lim̲(Gq)=1ML∑R(Y)|Y∈Apr̲(Gq)(5)Lim‾(Gq)=1MU∑R(Y)|Y∈Apr‾(Gq)(6)RN(Gq)=⌈Lim̲(Gq),Lim‾(Gq)⌋whereML,MUare the number of objects that contained inApr̲(Gq)andApr‾(Gq), respectively.Obviously, the lower limit and upper limit denote the mean value of elements included in its corresponding lower approximation and upper approximation, respectively. Their difference is defined as rough boundary interval (IRBnd(Gq)):(7)IRBnd(Gq)=Lim‾(Gq)-Lim̲(Gq)The rough boundary interval denotes the vagueness ofGq, where a larger one means more vague while a smaller one denotes a better precise. Then the subjective information can be denoted by rough number.Take a data setU={3,5,7,3,7}for example, it has three classes andR={G1,G2,G3}={3,5,7}. TakeG2to explain the definition of the rough number, according to Eqs. (1)–(3):Apr̲(5)=⋃{Y∈U/R(Y)≤5}={3,5,3}Apr‾(5)=⋃{Y∈U/R(Y)⩾5}={5,7,7}Bnd(5)=⋃{Y∈U/R(Y)≠5}={3,7,3,7}Therefore, the corresponding rough number ofG2is calculated by Eqs. (4)–(6):Lim̲(5)=1ML∑R(Y)|Y∈Apr̲(5)=13(3+5+3)=3.67Lim‾(5)=1MU∑R(Y)|Y∈Apr‾(5)=13(5+7+7)=6.33RN(5)=⌈Lim̲(5),Lim‾(5)⌋=⌈3.67,6.33⌋The rough boundary interval ofG2is defined as:IRBnd(5)=Lim‾(5)-Lim̲(5)=2.66Finally, the element ‘5’ in U is represented by a rough numberRN(5)=⌈3.67,6.33⌋. Similarly, other elements in U are determined in the same way.Because of the similarity with interval number, the arithmetic rules of interval number can also be used in rough number [48]. SupposeRN(α)=⌈Lim̲(α),Lim‾(α)⌋andRN(β)=⌈Lim̲(β),Lim‾(β)⌋are two rough numbers,μis a nonzero constant, then:(8)RN(α)×μ=⌈Lim̲(α),Lim‾(α)⌋×μ=⌈μ×Lim̲(α),μ×Lim‾(α)⌋(9)RN(α)+RN(β)=⌈Lim̲(α),Lim‾(α)⌋+⌈Lim̲(β),Lim‾(β)⌋=⌈Lim̲(α)+Lim̲(β),Lim‾(α)+Lim‾(β)⌋(10)RN(α)×RN(β)=⌈Lim̲(α),Lim‾(α)⌋×⌈Lim̲(β),Lim‾(β)⌋=⌈Lim̲(α)×Lim̲(α),Lim‾(α)×Lim‾(β)⌋VIKOR (Serbian name: VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje), also known as compromise ranking method, is an effective tool in MCDM. It is developed from theLp-metric in compromise programming:(11)Lp,i=∑j=1mwjfj∗-fijfj∗-fj-p1/p1⩽p⩽∞;i=1,2,…,nwhereLp,iis considered as an aggregating function;fijis the evaluation value of criterion j for alternativei;fj∗,fj-are the best and worst value of criterion j, respectively;wjis the weight of criterionj;mis the number of criteria; n is the number of alternatives; p denotes the weight of the maximal deviation from the ideal solution.In VIKOR,L1,i(expressed asSi) andL∞,i(expressed asRi) are used to formulate ranking measure. The final compromise solution is the one with a maximum group utility (minSi) of the majority, and a minimum of individual regret (minRi) of the opponent. It is a feasible solution which is the closest to the ideal [34].VIKOR is particularly powerful under such environment where the decision maker is unable, or does not know how to express his preference at the early stage of product development [30]. Furthermore, it has been combined with other methods including fuzzy sets, interval numbers and outranking methods to enhance its performance [41,31,24,49]. Due to its unique superiority, VIKOR has been widely used in various decision-making areas, such as material selection, robot selection and supplier selection [20,22,13,36].Among various decision-making techniques, AHP is widely used in the determination of relative importance while VIKOR is a powerful alternative evaluation method. The rough number is a good choice to manipulate the subjectivity and aggregate individual judgments and priorities under group decision-making environment. Thus these three methods can be combined to integrate the merit of AHP in hierarchy evaluation, the superiority of rough number in manipulating vagueness and the virtue of VIKOR in modeling MCDM to improve the objectivity of decision-making in design concept evaluation.
