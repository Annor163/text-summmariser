@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that can attack and kill bacteria. Thus, phages have become important potential resources of the development of anti-bacterial drugs [1].In the infection, bacteriophage initially attaches tightly to the bacterial surface via a specific receptor [2]. Subsequently, the genetic material of the phage is injected into the bacterial cell [3]. According to the type of phage, one of two life cycles (the lysis or lysogeny) will occur after infection [4, 5]. In the lytic cycle, the phage will produce daughter phage nucleic acids and proteins by using the bacteria׳s genetic mechanism. The phage proteins produced within the bacterial cell will make the cell wall to lyse, further releasing the offspring phages to infect other bacteria. During the lysogenic cycle, the phage DNA is integrated with the bacterial chromosome to create the prophage. The prophage will replicate along with the reproduction of bacterial host. The host cell is not destroyed. Thus, the offspring bacterial cells also contain the prophage which has capability to produce new phages. However, some adverse conditions such as UV or mutagenic chemicals can trigger the termination of the lysogenic state by changing the concentration of phage proteins [6]. The infected system will switch from lysogeny to lysis. Thus, the phage proteins located in host cell play a key role in destroying host cell membrane and killing bacteria [7].In fact, the phage proteins in host cell (abbreviated as phage host proteins or PH proteins) are mainly distributed in two subcellular locations of host. The first location is host cell membrane, in which the phage proteins are hydrolases or lyases and in charge of destroying host cell membrane [8,9]. The second location is host cell cytoplasm, in which the phage proteins are used to regulate the transcription of phage genes [10], assemble protease and procapsid [11], and mediate ssDNA packaging into virion [12].Accurate identification of the PH proteins and their host subcellular locations are of great importance for the exploration of the mechanism of host cell lysis and the development of potential antibacterial drugs. However, due to the limited experimental resource and expensive cost, it is not realistic to investigate all phage proteins. Computational methods pave a new way to study various biological problems. In fact, bioinformatics approaches are quite powerful and efficient in dealing with phage protein problems. Seguritan and Alves initially developed a computational method to classify viral structural proteins [13]. Since phage virion proteins have important functions, some methods have been proposed to identify them by using residue sequence information [14,15]. A free web-server PVPred has been constructed for phage virion proteins prediction [14]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no computational system was developed for the prediction of PH proteins or their host subcellular locations.This paper aims to develop a novel sequence-based method to identify PH proteins and their host subcellular locations.According to a recent review [16] and previous results [17–25], in order to establish a useful statistical predictor for identifying PH proteins and their host subcellular locations, we constructed an objective and strict benchmark dataset to train and test the proposed model, proposed g-gap dipeptide composition which could truly reflect the intrinsic correlation between two amino acids to formulate the protein samples, developed the analysis of various (ANOVA) based technique to perform feature selection and adopted the support vector machine (SVM) to perform the prediction. The anticipated accuracy was evaluated by using jackknife cross-validation. In addition, for the convenience of most experimental scientists, an online web server called PHPred was constructed based on the proposed method.To develop a sequence-based predictor for PH proteins, it is necessary to firstly construct a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the predictor. In this study, all data were collected from the Universal Protein Resource (Uniprot) [26]. To construct a high quality dataset, we firstly selected the phage proteins whose subcellular localizations had been experimentally confirmed. Secondly, the phage proteins which are the fragments of other phage proteins were dislodged because their information is incomplete. Thirdly, we excluded the proteins whose sequences contain nonstandard letters, such as ‘B’, ‘U’, ‘X’ or ‘Z’ because their meanings are ambiguous. Finally, the redundancy of the dataset was reduced by excluding those proteins with the sequence identity of less than 30% to any other protein in the dataset by using the CD-HIT software [27]. As a result, a total of 278 phage proteins with subcellular annotation were obtained and formulated by(1)S=SPH∪Snon−PHwhere theSPHcontains 144 phage proteins located in host cell (PH proteins) and theSnon−PHcontains 134 phage proteins which are not located in host cell (non-PH proteins). The PH proteins can be further classified into two types: the phage proteins located in host cell membrane (PHM proteins) and the phage proteins located in host cell cytoplasm (PHC proteins) and expressed as:(2)SPH=SPHM∪SPHCwhere theSPHMcontains 68 PHM proteins and theSPHCcontains 76 PHC proteins. The detailed sequences can be freely downloaded from the website (〈http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/PHP/data〉).After obtaining a standard dataset, we can formulate protein sequence samples with a mathematics descriptor. According to the most straightforward formulation method, a protein P can be expressed with the amino acid sequence as follows:(3)P=R1R2R3R4…RLwhere R1, R2 and RL, respectively denote the 1st, 2nd and L-th residues of the protein P. However, due to the length difference among protein sequences, it can only be used in some similarity searching programs such as BLAST and FASTA.For most of machine learning methods, it is required that the samples are all denoted by the vector with the same dimension. Amino acid composition (AAC) including 20-D features is the first strategy to formulate protein samples [28]. However, the residue-order information of sequence is lost. To overcome this disadvantage, dipeptide composition was used because it could reflect the correlation between two adjoining residues [29,30]. However, the long-range correlation information was still not considered in dipeptide. The pseudo amino acid composition was proposed to improve the formulation of protein samples [31–33]. It not only included the AAC information, but also contained the correlation of physicochemical properties between two residues. However, the direct correlation between two residues with the interval of g-gap residues was omitted. In fact, it is possible that two amino acids are adjacent in three-dimensional space, but far from each other in primary sequences. For example, in alpha helix, two non-adjoining residues are connected by hydrogen bonds. Thus, to incorporate the correlation of more residues as possible, the g-gap dipeptide composition was proposed in this work to formulate PH protein samples. Then a protein P can be expressed as(4)P=[f1g,f2g,⋯,fεg,⋯,f400g]Twhere thefεgis the frequency of the ε-th (ε=1, 2, …, 400) g-gap dipeptide and calculated by(5)fεg=nεg∑ε=1400nεg=nεgL−g−1wherenεgis the occurrence number of the ε-th g-gap dipeptide. L denotes the length of the protein P.SVM was used as the classification algorithm in this work because of its powerful performance in the field of bioinformatics [18,21,29,34–38]. The software (LibSVM) (〈https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/〉) was selected to implement SVM. The radial basis kernel function (RBF) was selected as the kernel function. A grid search method was applied in the selection of the regularization parameter C and kernel parameter γ through jackknife cross-validation. The search spaces for C and γ are, respectively [215, 2−5] and [2−5, 2−15] with the steps of 2−1 and 2.
