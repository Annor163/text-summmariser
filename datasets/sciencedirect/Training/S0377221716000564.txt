@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we generalize a formula for the discrete Choquet integral by replacing the standard product by a suitable fusion function. For the introduced fusion functions based discrete Choquet-like integrals we discuss and prove several properties and also show that our generalization leads to several new interesting functionals. We provide a complete characterization of the introduced functionals as aggregation functions. Forn=2,several new aggregation functions are obtained, and if symmetric capacities are considered, our approach yields new generalizations of OWA operators. If n > 2, the introduced functionals are aggregation functions only if they are Choquet integrals with respect to some distorted capacity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The Choquet integral (Choquet, 1953) is a distinguished tool in several domains of decision making , e.g., in economics, psychology, social sciences, etc. It merges the information contained in a capacity, which expresses the weights of the considered sets (of criteria, for example), and in observed quantity values (in a score vector, for example) into a single representative value. The Choquet integral was generalized in several directions. Not considering generalizations of the domains of capacities and integrated functions (e.g., from reals to intervals; Bustince, Galar, Bedregal, Kolesárová, & Mesiar, 2013), we can recall the Choquet-like integrals (Mesiar, 1995), concave integrals (Lehrer, 2009), universal integrals (Klement, Mesiar, & Pap, 2010) or copula-based integrals (Klement, Mesiar, Spizzichino, & Stupňanová, 2014). All these generalizations are monotone functionals. However, in the case of integrating with respect to capacities, these generalizations need not be aggregation functions or translation invariant, and therefore they violate some of the genuine properties of the Choquet integral.The aim of our paper is to introduce a generalization of the Choquet integral without this imperfection. Generalizing a formula for the discrete Choquet integral based on a comonotone representation of the considered integrand, we introduce a class of fusion functions based discrete Choquet-like integrals, all of them being translation invariant.The following notions will be needed throughout the paper.Definition 1Fixn∈N,n ≥ 2. We say that a real functionF:[0,1]n→Ris:(i)a fusion function if its range RanF⊆[0, 1];fixed at zero ifF(0)=F(0,…,0)=0;normed if it is fixed at zero andF(1)=F(1,…,1)=1;a weakly monotone pre-aggregation function if it is a normed fusion function andF(x1,…,xn)≤F(x1+c,…,xn+c)for each(x1,…,xn)∈[0,1]nand c ∈ [0, 1] such that(x1+c,…,xn+c)∈[0,1]n;an aggregation function if it is a normed fusion function which is monotone increasing in each variable;a semicopula ifn=2and F is a binary aggregation function with neutral elemente=1,i.e.,F(x,1)=F(1,x)=xfor each x ∈ [0, 1];a quasi-copula if it is a 1-Lipschitz semicopula, i.e., a semicopula satisfying the property|F(x1,y1)−F(x2,y2)|≤|x1−x2|+|y1−y2|for all x1, x2, y1, y2 ∈ [0, 1].Formally, fusion functions can be seen as operations on the unit interval [0, 1], i.e., ([0, 1], F) is a grupoid. However, we prefer the terminology “fusion functions” because these operations generalize several kinds of particular functions known from information fusion, including monotone measure and integral theory (Klement et al., 2010), multicriteria decision support (Beliakov, Pradera, & Calvo, 2007; Grabisch, Marichal, Mesiar, & Pap, 2009) or fuzzy logics (Baczynski & Jayaram, 2008; Klement, Mesiar, & Pap, 2000), such as aggregation functions, t-norms, t-conorms, semicopulas, implication functions, and also overlap functions (Bedregal, Dimuro, Bustince, & Barrenechea, 2013; Bustince, Fernandez, Mesiar, Montero, & Orduna, 2010), grouping functions (Bustince, Pagola, Mesiar, Hüllermeier, & Herrera, 2012), etc. Recall that aggregation functions A: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1], deeply studied, e.g., in Beliakov et al. (2007) and Grabisch et al. (2009), are characterized by monotonicity and the boundary conditionsA(0,0)=0andA(1,1)=1. However, several classical means (such as, e.g., the Lehmer mean (Beliakov, Bustince, & Calvo, 2016; Wilkin & Beliakov, 2015) given byL(x,y)=x2+y2x+yfor (x, y) ≠ (0, 0), andL(0,0)=0) are not aggregation functions because though they satisfy boundary conditions, their monotonicity is violated. Nevertheless, they satisfy a weaker form of monotonicity that is linked to the same increase of both arguments. This weaker type of monotonicity, which is called a weak monotonicity (Wilkin & Beliakov, 2015), is often considered, e.g., in image processing. Note that the weak monotonicity is monotonicity in the direction given by the vectorr→=(1,1),see Bustince, Fernandez, Kolesárová, and Mesiar (2015). For more details we recommend (Beliakov et al., 2007; Bustince et al., 2015; Calvo, Kolesárová, Komorníková, & Mesiar, 2002; Durante & Sempi, 2005; Genest, Molina, Rodríguez-Lallena, & Sempi, 1999; Grabisch et al., 2009; Lucca et al., 2016; Wilkin & Beliakov, 2015).The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we recall the (discrete) Choquet integral and some of its properties. In Section 3, we introduce a functionalCmF,which is based on a capacity m and a binary fusion function F, and then, we study its properties including idempotency, translation invariance, positive homogeneity, etc. In Section 4, we fixn=2and investigate in detail the classA2of all fusion functions F such thatCmFis a binary aggregation function for each capacity m. Similarly, Section 5 is devoted to the classAn,n > 2, of all fusion functions F such thatCmFdefined on [0, 1]nis an n-ary aggregation function for any capacity m. Finally, some concluding remarks are provided.The Choquet integral can be defined on an arbitrary monotone measure space(X,S,m),where X is a non-empty set,Sa σ-algebra of its subsets andm:S→[0,∞]a monotone measure, i.e., a monotone set function with the propertym(∅)=0.Definition 2Let(X,S,m)be a monotone measure space. For anyS-measurable function f: X → [0, ∞], the Choquet integral Chm(f) is given by(1)Chm(f)=∫0∞m({x∈X∣f(x)≥t})dt,where the expression on the right-hand side of (1) is the (improper) Riemann integral.We summarize several genuine properties of the Choquet integral:1.For any monotone measure m, Chm( · ) is:•fixed at zero, i.e.,Chm(0)=0,where 0 is the zero function on X;monotone, i.e., Chm(f) ≤ Chm(g) whenever f ≤ g;positively homogeneous, i.e., for each c > 0 it holds thatChm(cf)=cChm(f);comonotone additive, i.e.,Chm(f+g)=Chm(f)+Chm(g)for all comonotone functions f and g. Recall that f and g are comonotone if they are measurable with respect to the same chain, i.e., if{{f≥t}∣t∈[0,∞]}∪{{g≥t}∣t∈[0,∞]}is a chain.The integral gives back the considered measure, i.e.,Chm(1E)=m(E)for eachE∈S,where 1Eis the indicator of the set E,1E(x)=1if x ∈ E, otherwise1E(x)=0.For any normed monotone measure m, i.e., monotone measure with the propertym(X)=1,Chm( · ) is:•idempotent, i.e.,Chm(c1X)=cfor each c ∈ [0, ∞[;translation invariant, i.e., for any c > 0,Chm(f+c)=Chm(f)+c;a mean, i.e.,inff≤Chm(f)≤supf.In this paper, we will only consider finite spaces X (e.g., sets of criteria). Hence, without loss of generality, we will deal with the spaceX=N={1,…,n},for some natural numbern∈N,n ≥ 2, and with the σ-algebraS=2N. Moreover, we will only consider normed monotone measures and call them capacities (Grabisch et al., 2009). The set of all capacities m: 2N→ [0, 1] will be denoted byMn. The considered functions will have their range in [0, 1] (score in single criteria, for example), and they will be denoted by x, x ∈ [0, 1]n, which reflects the fact that each 2N-measurable function on N with range in [0, 1] can be viewed as an n-dimensional vector from [0, 1]n. Though the next result, which is often called the “discrete Choquet integral”, can be derived directly from the formula (1), it also follows from the above mentioned properties of the Choquet integral.Proposition 1Let m: 2N→ [0, 1] be a capacity. Then for anyx ∈ [0, 1]nit holds that(2)Chm(x)=∑i=1n(x(i)−x(i−1))m(E(i)),where ( · ): N → N is a permutation such thatx(1)≤…≤x(n),E(i)={(i),…,(n)}, i ∈ N, and by convention,x(0)=0.It can be shown thatx=∑i=1n(x(i)−x(i−1))1E(i). Due to the comonotone additivity of the Choquet integral, by induction we getChm(x)=∑i=1nChm((x(i)−x(i−1))1E(i)).Now, the result follows from positive homogeneity and giving back measure property, which ensure thatChm(c1E)=cm(E)for each c ∈ [0, 1] and E⊆N.□Note that though the permutation ( · ) considered in (2) need not be unique, the output of (2) does not depend on the chosen permutation. For more details on the discrete Choquet integral (2) we recommend Grabisch (1995) and Chapter 5 of the monograph Grabisch et al. (2009).Evaluation formula (2) for the discrete Choquet integral merges the incrementsx(i)−x(i−1)and the capacity values m(E(i)) by means of the standard product of reals. Both merged inputs as well as their output are values from the unit interval [0, 1]. This fact has inspired us to substitute the product by a binary fusion function F: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] (see Bustince et al., 2015) and define a generalizationCmFof the Choquet integral based on F, namely,CmF:[0,1]n→[0,n],(3)CmF(x)=∑i=1nF(x(i)−x(i−1),m(E(i))).The first step in the proposed approach was done and some examples were given in our recent paper (Lucca et al., 2016). Note that the definition of a binary fusion function requires F to be a [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] function only. As already mentioned in the previous section, the permutation ( · ): N → N with the propertyx(1)≤…≤x(n),which is considered in formulas (2) and (3), need not be unique. Thus formula (3) defines a functionalCmFcorrectly only if its evaluation does not depend on the considered permutation. Obviously, if there are no ties between the input valuesx1,…,xn,then the permutation ( · ) is unique. Now, suppose that there are some ties, for example, letx1=x2<x3<⋯<xn. Then, there are two appropriate permutations, ( · )1 and ( · )2, where(i)1=ifor each i ∈ N, and(1)2=2,(2)2=1and(i)2=ifor i > 2. Then∑i=1nF(x(i)1−x(i−1)1,m(E(i)1))=∑i=1nF(x(i)2−x(i−1)2,m(E(i)2))if and only ifF(0,m({2,3,…,n}))=F(0,m({1,3,…,n})).For any y ∈ [0, 1], there is a capacity my: 2N→ [0, 1] withmy({2,3,…,n})=0andmy({1,3,…,n})=y,and hence, necessarily(4)F(0,0)=F(0,y).As a basic property of the proposed generalizationCmFwe will requireCmFto be fixed at zero.CmFis fixed at zero if and only if0=CmF(0,…,0)=∑i=1nF(0,m(E(i))),i.e., for any n ≥ 2,m∈Mn,and ∅ ≠ E⊆N it holds that(5)F(0,m(E))=0.Combining (4) and (5), we can see thatCmFis well defined and fixed at zero for each capacity m only if(6)F(0,y)=0foreachy∈[0,1].It is not difficult to see that (6) is also a sufficient condition forCmFto be well defined and fixed at zero.Definition 3Let F: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] be a fusion function satisfying (6). Then the functionalCmF:[0,1]n→[0,n],given by (3), is called a fusion function based discrete Choquet-like integral (F-based discrete Choquet-like integral for short).In what follows, the set of all fusion functions F: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] satisfying (6) will be denoted byF0.Example 1(i)Consider c ∈ [0, 1] and define the function Fc: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] byFc(x,y)={0ifx=0,cotherwise.ThenFc∈F0,and for any n ≥ 2 and capacitym∈Mnit holds thatCmFc(x)=c·card({x1,…,xn}∖{0}).For example,CmFc(0)=0,CmFc(1)=candCmFc(1n,2n,…,nn)=nc. Clearly,CmFcis not monotone whenever c > 0.ConsiderF∈F0given byF(x,y)=xy2. Then, for any n ≥ 2 andm∈Mn,we haveCmF=Chm2,i.e.,CmFis the discrete Choquet integral with respect to the capacity m2.The properties of a fusion function based discrete Choquet-like integral are related to the properties of the considered fusion functionF∈F0and, in some cases, also to the properties of the considered capacity m. Before discussing some of them, we list several simple properties ofCmF.Proposition 2LetF∈F0. Then for any fixed n ≥ 2 and anym∈Mnit holds that(i)For each fixed x ∈ [0, 1],CmF(x,…,x)=xif and only ifF(x,1)=x. In particular,CmF(0)=0andCmF(1)=1if and only ifF(1,1)=1.CmFgives back the considered capacity m if and only ifF(1,y)=yfor each y ∈ [0, 1].For anyG∈F0,F ≤ G, it holds thatCmF≤CmG.CmF(x)∈[0,1]for allx ∈ [0, 1]nif and only ifF(u1,1)+∑i=2nF(ui,vi)≤1for anyu1,…,un,v1,…,vn∈[0,1]such that∑i=1nui≤1.In general, the range of functionalsCmFis a subset of [0, n], i.e.,RanCmF⊆[0,n]. By Proposition 2,RanCmF⊆[0,1],i.e.,CmFis a fusion function if and only if the condition (iv) of this proposition is satisfied.Corollary 1LetF∈F0. Then for any fixed n ≥ 2 and anym∈Mn,CmFis a normed fusion function if and only if the condition (iv) in Proposition2is valid andF(1,1)=1. In particular, if F is a semicopula, thenCmFis a normed fusion function which gives back the considered capacity m.The following claim is an easy consequence of Proposition 2, item (i).Corollary 2LetF∈F0and n ≥ 2. Then, for anym∈Mn,the F-based discrete Choquet-like integralCmFis idempotent if and only ifF(x,1)=xfor each x ∈ [0, 1].Consider c ∈ [0, 1] andF∈F0given byF(x,y)={0ifx=0,xify=1,cotherwise.Then, for any capacitym∈Mnsuch thatm(E)=1if and only ifE=N,it holds thatCmF(x)=x(1)+c·card({x(2),…,x(n)}∖{x(1)}).Observe thatCmFis translation invariant andsup{CmF(x)∣x∈[0,1]n}=1+(n−1)c.LetF∈F0and n ≥ 2. Then the corresponding F-based discrete Choquet-like integralCmFsatisfies the property(7)CmF(x)≥min1≤i≤nxi=x(1)for allm∈Mnandx ∈ [0, 1]nif and only if F(x, 1) ≥ x for all x ∈ [0, 1].Recall thatCmF(x)=F(x(1),1)+∑i=2nF(x(i)−x(i−1),m(E(i))).Now, the sufficiency is immediate, and for proving the necessity it is enough to consider an inputx=(x,…,x).□LetF∈F0and n ≥ 2. Then the corresponding F-based discrete Choquet-like integralCmFsatisfies the property(8)CmF(x)≤max1≤i≤nxi=x(n)for allm∈Mnandx ∈ [0, 1]nif and only if F(x, y) ≤ x for all x, y ∈ [0, 1].The sufficiency was already shown in Lucca et al. (2016). Indeed, for anym∈Mnand x ∈ [0, 1]n, it holds thatCmF(x)=∑i=1nF(x(i)−x(i−1),m(E(i)))≤∑i=1n(x(i)−x(i−1))=x(n)=max1≤i≤nxi.To see the necessity, suppose that F(x, y) > x for some x, y ∈ [0, 1]. Clearly, asF∈F0,x > 0. Consider a capacitym∈Mnsuch thatm(E)=yfor any singleton E ⊂ N. ThenCmF(0,…,0,x)=∑i=1n−1F(0,m(E(i)))+F(x,y)>x=x(n),which proves our result.□It is important to stress that ifF∈F0satisfies F(x, y) ≤ x for all x, y ∈ [0, 1], then it also satisfies condition (iv) in Proposition 2 and hence the corresponding functionCmFis a fusion function. In general, the reversed implication does not hold, see Example 3. However, if forF∈F0it holds thatF(x,1)=xfor all x ∈ [0, 1], then both considered conditions are equivalent.Example 3For any d ∈ ] 0.5, 1[ define a function Fd: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] byFd(x,y)=1[d,1](x).ThenFd∈F0satisfies the condition (iv) in Proposition 2, butFd((d+1)/2,y)=1>(d+1)/2. For any n ≥ 2 and anym∈Mnit holds thatCmFd(x)={1ifmax{x(1),x(2)−x(1),…,x(n)−x(n−1)}≥d,0otherwise.Note thatCmFdis a symmetric weakly monotone pre-aggregation function, but neither a mean nor an aggregation function. Ifn=2,for anym∈M2it holds thatCmFd(x,y)={1ifmax{min{x,y},|x−y|}≥d,0otherwise,see Fig. 1.We can immediately formulate a corollary characterizing F-based discrete Choquet-like integrals which are means.Corollary 3LetF∈F0and n ≥ 2. For anym∈Mn,CmFis a mean, i.e.,Min≤CmF≤Max,if and only if for all x, y ∈ [0, 1] it holds thatF(x,y)≤x≤F(x,1).Here Min denotes the aggregation function defined byMin(x1,…,xn)=min{x1,…,xn},and Max is given analogously (Beliakov et al., 2007; Calvo et al., 2002; Grabisch et al., 2009).Observe that if the property F(x, y) ≤ x ≤ F(x, 1) is valid for all x, y ∈ [0, 1], thenF(x,1)=x,which ensures the idempotency ofCmF,see Corollary 2. This observation reflects the well-known fact that each mean is idempotent.The following proposition characterizes translation invariant F-based discrete Choquet-like integrals. Let us recall that the translation invariance of a function F: [0, 1]n→ [0, ∞[ means thatF(x1+c,x2+c,…,xn+c)=F(x1,…,xn)+cfor any c ∈ ]0, 1] and(x1,…,xn)∈[0,1]nsuch that also(x1+c,…,xn+c)∈[0,1]n. Note that for each capacitym∈Mn,the Choquet integral Chm: [0, 1]n→ [0, 1] is translation invariant.Proposition 5LetF∈F0and n ≥ 2. For anym∈Mn,CmFis translation invariant if and only ifF(x,1)=xfor all x ∈ [0, 1].It is clear that for any admissible x ∈ [0, 1]nand c ∈ ]0, 1], if a permutation ( · ) satisfies the propertyx(1)≤…≤x(n),then it also holds thatx(1)+c≤⋯≤x(n)+c. Consequently,CmF(x1+c,…,xn+c)=F(x(1)+c,1)+∑i=2nF(x(i)−x(i−1),m(E(i)))=F(x(1)+c,1)−F(x(1),1)+CmF(x1,…,xn).Thus, the translation invariance ofCmFis equivalent to the validity of the equality(9)F(x(1)+c,1)=c+F(x(1),1).Now, the sufficiency is trivial. To show the necessity, it is enough to consider the inputx=0. Then (9) givesF(c,1)=c+F(0,1)for each c ∈] 0, 1]. AsF∈F0,F(0,1)=0,henceF(c,1)=cfor each c ∈] 0, 1], and so forF∈F0we can conclude thatF(x,1)=xfor each x ∈ [0, 1].□Comparing Corollary 2 and Proposition 5, we can see that in the framework of F-based discrete Choquet-like integrals, idempotency and translation invariance are equivalent.We now turn our attention to the positive homogeneity of functionalsCmF. Recall thatCmFis positively homogeneous ifCmF(cx)=cCmF(x)for any c > 0, and x, cx ∈ [0, 1]n.Proposition 6LetF∈F0and n ≥ 2. For anym∈Mn,the functionalCmFis positively homogeneous if and only if F is positively homogeneous in the first variable, i.e.,F(cx,y)=cF(x,y)for any c > 0, x, cx and y ∈ [0, 1].Due to the positive homogeneity of F in the first variable,F(x,y)=xF(1,y)for all x, y ∈ [0, 1]. Next, for any admissible x ∈ [0, 1]nand c > 0, if for a permutation ( · ) we have x(1) ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ x(n), then it also holds that cx(1) ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ cx(n). Consequently,CmF(cx)=∑i=1nF(c(x(i)−x(i−1)),m(E(i))).Now, the sufficiency is obvious.The necessity can be shown by considering the inputx=(0,…,0,1). On the one hand, the positive homogeneity ofCmFensures for any c ∈] 0, 1],CmF(0,…,0,c)=cCmF(0,…,0,1),on the other hand, we haveCmF(0,…,0,c)=F(c,m({n}))andCmF(0,…,0,1)=F(1,m({n})).Comparing the previous equations, we obtainF(c,m({n}))=cF(1,m({n})).Now, it is enough to consider a capacitym∈Mnsuch thatm({n})=y,and the necessary condition follows.□Note that the constraint imposed on F in Proposition 6 is equivalent to the evaluationF(x,y)=xf(y),where f: [0, 1] → [0, 1] is given byf(y)=F(1,y).Next, let us denote byF*the class of all binary fusion functionsF∈F0satisfying the constraints of Corollary 2 and Propositions 3–5, i.e.,F*={F∈F0∣F(x,1)=xandF(x,y)≤xforallx,y∈[0,1]}.ThenF*is a convex class, and if the standard partial ordering of binary functions is considered, it is a lattice with the top element F* and the bottom element F*, which are given by(10)F*(x,y)=xandF*(x,y)={xify=1,0otherwise.In particular, any semicopula F belongs to the classF*.It is not difficult to check that for any capacitym∈Mn,CmF*(x)=x(n),i.e.,CmF*=Max=Chm*is the Choquet integral with respect to the strongest capacity m* which is defined bym*(E)={0ifE=∅,1otherwise.Formally, for anym∈Mn,m*(E)=f*(m(E))for each E ∈ 2N, E ≠ ∅, where f*: [0, 1] → [0, 1] is a constant function given byf*(x)=1.On the other hand,CmF*(x)=x(i),where (i) satisfies the requirement thatm(E(i))=1butm(E(i+1))<1(with conventionE(n+1)=∅). This F-based discrete Choquet-like integral can also be represented as a discrete Choquet integral, namely,CmF*=Chf*(m),where the function f*: [0, 1] → [0, 1] is given byf*(x)={1ifx=1,0otherwise.It is also worth noting that for any λ ∈ [0, 1] and allF1,F2∈F*,it holds thatCmλF1+(1−λ)F2=λCmF1+(1−λ)CmF2.Recall that one of the basic properties of the Choquet integral is its comonotone additivity. For fusion functions based discrete Choquet-like integrals we have the next result.Proposition 7LetF∈F0. IfF(x+y,z)=F(x,z)+F(y,z),for all x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] withx+y≤1,then, for anym∈Mn,CmFis comonotone additive, that is, for each comonotone vectorsx, x′ ∈ [0, 1]nwithx+x′∈[0,1]n,CmF(x+x′)=CmF(x)+CmF(x′).CmF(x+x′)=∑i=1nF((x+x′)(i)−(x+x′)(i−1),m(E(i)))=∑i=1nF((x(i)+x(i)′)−(x(i−1)+x(i−1)′),m(E(i)))=∑i=1n(F(x(i)−x(i−1),m(E(i)))+F(x(i)′−x(i−1)′,m(E(i))))=CmF(x)+CmF(x′).□Note that the additivity ofCmFin the first component means thatF(x,y)=xf(y)for some function f: [0, 1] → [0, 1]. The fusion function F is then also positively homogeneous, which ensures the next result (compare with Proposition 6).Corollary 4LetF∈F0. IfF(x+y,z)=F(x,z)+F(y,z),for all x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] withx+y≤1,then, for anym∈Mn,CmFis a comonotone linear functional, that is, for each comonotone vectorsx, x′ ∈ [0, 1]n, and α, β ∈ [0, 1], withαx+βx′∈[0,1]n,CmF(αx+βx′)=αCmF(x)+βCmF(x′).Considerm∈Mn,c ∈] 0, 1] andFc,Fl∈F0,defined byFc(x,y)=cxyandFl(x,y)=x. ThenCmFcandCmFlare positively homogeneous and comonotone additive, that is, they are comonotone linear. Note thatCmFc(x)=Chm(cx)andCmFl(x)=x(n)=max1≤i≤nxi.At the end of this section, we turn to investigating the duality of functionsCmF. LetDdenote the class of all binary fusion functions fromF*satisfying for all x ∈ [0, 1] the conditionF(x,0)=0.Observe first that for eachF∈D,the flipped functionF˜:[0,1]2→R,given byF˜(x,y)=x−F(x,1−y)belongs toDand(F˜)˜=F.Now, fixF∈D. By Corollary 3, it is clear thatCmFis a normed fusion function. It is natural to ask what the relationship between the dual normed fusion function(CmF)d:[0,1]n→[0,1]and the original normed fusion functionCmFis, if the dual is given by(11)(CmF)d(x)=1−CmF(1−x).Let x ∈ [0, 1]n. Consider a permutation ( · ) such that x(1) ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ x(n). Putxd=1−x. Thenx(n)d=1−x(n)≤⋯≤1−x(1)=x(1)dand thus, with the conventionx(n+1)d=0,we get(CmF)d(x)=1−∑i=1nF(x(n−i+1)d−x(n−i+2)d,m({(n−i+1),…(1)}))=1−F(1−x(n),1)−∑i=2nF(x(n−i+2)−x(n−i+1),1−md({(n−i+2),…,(n)}))=∑i=1n(x(i)−x(i−1)−F(x(i)−x(i−1),1−md({(i),…,(n)})))=CmdF˜(x),where the dual capacity md: 2N→ [0, 1] is given bymd(E)=1−m(N∖E). An illustrative example follows.Example 5Considern=2,F∈Dand a capacitym∈M2determined by values a, b ∈ [0, 1]. For x < y it holds thatCmdF˜(x,y)=F˜(x,1)+F˜(y−x,1−a)=x+y−x−F(y−x,a)=y−F(y−x,a)and(CmF)d(x,y)=1−CmF(1−x,1−y)=1−(F(1−y,1)+F(y−x,a))=y−F(y−x,a).IfF∈Dis flipping invariant, i.e.,F˜=F,then(CmF)d=CmdF. In particular, for the standard product Π,Π(x,y)=xy,which belongs toDand moreover,Π˜=Π,we obtain a well-known duality result for the Choquet integral(Chm)d=(CmΠ)d=CmdΠ=Chmd.Finally, observe that the greatest element D* ofDis given byD*(x,y)={xify>0,0ify=0,while the smallest element D* is equal to F*, see (10). Thus,CmD*(x)=max{x(i)∣m(E(i))>0},CmD*(x)=max{x(i)∣m(E(i))=1}.Moreover,(D*)˜=D*and(CmD*)d=CmdD*.In this section we fixn=2. Then any capacitym∈M2is completely determined by values a, b ∈ [0, 1], wherea=m({1})andb=m({2}). For anyF∈F0andm∈M2it holds that(12)CmF(x,y)={F(x,1)+F(y−x,b)ifx≤y,F(y,1)+F(x−y,a)otherwise.Recall thatCmF(0,0)=0andCmF(1,1)=1wheneverF(1,1)=1.Proposition 8LetF∈F0. The binary F-based discrete Choquet-like integralCmFis a weakly monotone pre-aggregation function for anym∈M2if and only if:(i)F(x1, 1) ≤ F(x2, 1) whenever x1 ≤ x2,F(1,1)=1,F(u,1)+F(v,z)≤1for any u, v, z ∈ [0, 1] satisfyingu+v≤1.The sufficiency is obvious. To prove the necessity, first observe thatCmF(1,1)=1forcesF(1,1)=1. Moreover, asCmF(x,y)∈[0,1],considering in (12)a=b=z,we obtainF(min{x,y},1)+F(|x−y|,z)≤1.Now, for any u, v ∈ [0, 1],u+v≤1,it is enough to putx=uandy=u+v,which results inF(u,1)+F(v,z)≤1,compare also (iv) in Proposition 2.Finally, asCmF(x+c,y+c)=F(min{x,y}+c,1)−F(min{x,y},1)+CmF(x,y),the weak monotonicity ofCmFimpliesF(min{x,y}+c,1)≥F(min{x,y},1),i.e., F(x1, 1) ≤ F(x2, 1) whenever x1 ≤ x2, which completes the proof.□Observe that the standard product Π, belongs to the classF*,and that for eachm∈M2,CmΠ=Chmis an idempotent aggregation function. Let us denote byA2the class of all binary fusion functionsF∈F0such that for eachm∈M2,CmFis a binary aggregation function. The class of all fusion functionsF∈A2for which the F-based discrete Choquet-like integralCmFis, for eachm∈M2,idempotent, i.e., a translation invariant mean, will be denoted byA2I.The following theorem provides a characterization of allF∈A2.Theorem 1LetF∈F0. ThenF∈A2if and only ifF(x,1)=xfor all x ∈ [0, 1] and the function F( ·, y): [0, 1] → [0, 1] is increasing and 1-Lipschitz for each y ∈ [0, 1], i.e.,0≤F(x2,y)−F(x1,y)≤x2−x1whenever 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1.LetF∈F0,m∈M2,m({1})=a,m({2})=b. Then the formula forCmFis given by (12). To prove the sufficiency of conditions, consider first thatx=y. ThenCmF(x,x)=xand for allϵ∈[0,1−x]we haveCmF(x+ϵ,x)=x+F(ϵ,a)≥CmF(x,x)andCmF(x,x+ϵ)=x+F(ϵ,b)≥CmF(x,x).If x < y, then from (12) and the monotonicity of F( ·, b), for eachϵ∈[0,1−y]we obtainCmF(x,y)=F(x,1)+F(y−x,b)≤F(x,1)+F(y+ϵ−x,b)=CmF(x,y+ϵ).Next, due to the 1-Lipschitz property of F( ·, b), for eachϵ∈[0,y−x]we haveCmF(x,y)=F(x,1)+F(y−x,b)=x+F(y−x,b)≤x+ϵ+F(y−x−ϵ,b)=CmF(x+ϵ,y).Summarizing, we have shown the increasing monotonicity ofCmFif x ≤ y. For x > y the property can be shown in a similar way. AsCmF(0,0)=0andCmF(1,1)=1,CmFis an aggregation function.To prove the necessity, consider firstm=m*,i.e.,a=b=1. ThenCm*F(x,y)=F(min{x,y},1)+F(|y−x|,1).Suppose thatCm*Fis an aggregation function and putF(x,1)=f(x). For any x1, x2 with 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1 it holds thatCm*F(x1,x1)=f(x1)+f(0)andCm*F(x2,x2)=f(x2)+f(0),and from the increasing monotonicity ofCmF,we get f(x1) ≤ f(x2). Hence, f is an increasing function and sinceF∈F0,f(0)=0. Moreover,Cm*F(1,1)=1ensuresF(1,1)=f(1)=1. Now, suppose that 0 ≤ x ≤ y. ThenCm*F(0,y)≤Cm*F(x,y)is equivalent tof(y)≤f(x)+f(y−x),i.e., f is a subadditive function. Next, for anyk∈N,i∈{0,1,…,,k−1},it holds thatCm*F(ik,i+1k)=f(ik)+f(1k)≤Cm*F(i+1k,i+1k)=f(i+1k).Because of the subadditivity of f, the last inequality turns into the equality,f(i+1k)=f(ik)+f(1k).Proceeding by induction, we obtain1=f(1)=f(kk)=kf(1k)andf(ik)=if(1k).Thus, for any rational p ∈ [0, 1],f(p)=p,and due to the monotonicity of f,f(x)=x,i.e.,F(x,1)=xfor all x ∈ [0, 1].Finally, consider a capacityma∈M2,a ∈ [0, 1[, such thatma({1})=ma({2})=a. Then, for any x, y ∈ [0, 1] with x < y andϵ∈[0,y−x],we haveCmaF(x,y)=x+F(y−x,a)≤CmaF(x+ϵ,y)=x+ϵ+F(y−x−ϵ,a).Denotingu=y−x−ϵ,we obtainF(u+ϵ,a)−F(u,a)≤ϵ,which proves the 1-Lipschitz property of F(·, a).□Note that the conditionF(x,1)=xfor all x ∈ [0, 1] given in Theorem 1 can be weaken intoF(1,1)=1. Because of the 1-Lipschitz property of F( ·, 1), asF(0,1)=0,it holds that F(x, 1) ≤ x, andF(1,1)−F(x,1)=1−F(x,1)≤1−xgives F(x, 1) ≥ x. ThusF(x,1)=x.The following result shows that ifCmFis an aggregation function for anym∈M2thenCmFis idempotent and translation invariant. This fact is an easy consequence of Theorem 1, Corollary 2 and Proposition 5.Corollary 5It holds thatA2=A2I.Before giving an example, we recall that each quasi-copula Q, see Section 1, satisfies the constraints of Theorem 1, henceQ∈A2.Example 6(i)Consider the greatest quasi-copula Min,Min(x,y)=min{x,y}and a capacitym∈M2,withm({1})=a,m({2})=b. ThenCmMin(x,y)={min{y,x+b}ifx≤y,min{x,y+a}otherwise=max{min{y,x+b},min{x,y+a}},see Figs. 2and 3.Consider the smallest quasi-copula W,W(x,y)=max{0,x+y−1},andm∈M2,determined by a, b ∈ [0, 1] as in (i). ThenCmW(x,y)={max{x,y+b−1}ifx≤y,max{y,x+a−1}otherwise=min{max{x,y+b−1},max{y,x+a−1}},see Figs. 4and 5.Consider the function F: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] given byF(x,y)={xify=1,xy2otherwiseNote thatF∈A2but it is not a quasi-copula. For anym∈M2determined by a, b ∈ [0, 1[ as above, it holds thatCmF(x,y)={(1−b2)x+b2yifx≤y,a2x+(1−a2)yotherwise=Chm˜(x,y),i.e.,CmFis the Choquet integral with respect to a capacitym˜∈M2such thatm˜({1})=a2andm˜({2})=b2.In the previous section, we have characterized the classA2of all binary fusion functionsF∈F0with the property that the F-based discrete Choquet-like integralCmFdefined on [0, 1]2 is a binary aggregation for anym∈M2.In this section, we will characterize, for any n > 2, the classAnof all binary fusion functionsF∈F0for whichCmFdefined on [0, 1]nis an n-ary aggregation function for anym∈Mn.Theorem 2LetF∈F0. For any n > 2,F∈Anif and only ifF∈G,whereGis the set of allF∈F0which are given byF(x,y)=xf(y),for some increasing function f: [0, 1] → [0, 1] satisfyingf(1)=1.The sufficiency is obvious. To prove the necessity, observe first that ifCmFis an n-ary aggregation function then the function H: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] given byH(x,y)=CmF(x,y,max{x,y},…,max{x,y})is a binary aggregation function andH=CμF,whereμ∈M2is determined byμ({1})=a=m({1,3,…,n})andμ({2})=b=m({2,3,…,n}). Therefore,An⊆A2,and thus, by Theorem 1,F(x,1)=x,F(0,y)=0and F( ·, y) is an increasing and 1-Lipschitz function for all x, y ∈ [0, 1].Next, considern=3and appropriate capacitiesm∈M3. First, letm(E)=a∈[0,1]whenever card(E) ∈ {1, 2} and suppose that x < y < z. LetCmF:[0,1]3→[0,1]given byCmF(x,y,z)=x+F(y−x,a)+F(z−y,a)be an aggregation function. ThenCmF(x,z,z)≥CmF(x,y,z),or equivalently,F(z−x,a)+F(0,a)=F(z−x,a)≥F(y−x,a)+F(z−y,a).Similarly, fromCmF(x,x+z−y,z)≥CmF(x,x,z)we obtainF(z−x,a)≤F(y−x,a)+F(z−y,a).Summarizing, we haveF(z−x,a)=F(y−x,a)+F(z−y,a).Due to the arbitrariness of x < y < z, it is not difficult to check that then, for any t, s ≥ 0 such thatt+s≤1,it holds thatF(t+s,a)=F(t,a)+F(s,a).The obtained equation is Cauchy’s equation, see Aczél (1966), which has the unique solutionF(x,a)=xF(1,a).PuttingF(1,a)=f(a),we getF(x,y)=xf(y)andf(1)=F(1,1)=1.Now, consider a capacitym∈M3such thatm(E)=aifcard(E)=2,m(E)=bif E is a singleton, and a > b. Then for any x < y < z andϵ=z−y2it holds thatCmF(x,y,z)=x+(y−x)f(a)+(z−y)f(b)≤CmF(x,y+ϵ,z)=x+(y+ϵ−x)f(a)+(z−y−ϵ)f(b).After a short computation we can deduce that f(a) ≥ f(b), which proves the increasing monotonicity of f.Summarizing, we have just proved thatA3=G. To prove thatAn=Galso holds for n > 3, it is enough to observe that for eachF∈F0andm∈Mn,ifCmFis an n-ary aggregation function, then the function H: [0, 1]3 → [0, 1] given byH(x,y,z)=CmF(x,y,z,max{x,y,z},…,max{x,y,z})is a ternary aggregation function andH=CμF,whereμ∈M3satisfies, for any ∅ ≠ E ⊂ {1, 2, 3},μ(E)=m(E∪{4,…,n}). This completes the proof.□In the case of Theorem 2, ifF∈An,thenCmF=Chf(m),where Chf(m) is the Choquet integral with respect to the capacityf(m)∈Mngiven byf(m)(E)={0ifE=∅,f(m(E))otherwise.Indeed, ifF∈An=G,thenF(x,y)=xf(y),andCmF(x)=∑i=1nF(x(i)−x(i−1),m(E(i)))=∑i=1n(x(i)−x(i−1))f(m(E(i)))=Chf(m)(x).Summarizing, we have proved that for any n > 2, an F-based discrete Choquet-like integralCmFis an n-ary aggregation function for anym∈Mnif and only if it is the Choquet integral with respect to the capacity m distorted by a function f generating F, i.e.,CmF=Chf(m).Finally, let us note that the functions f* and f* (introduced in Section 3) are the extremal elements of the classGfof all functions f: [0, 1] → [0, 1] generating functionsF∈G. Moreover, the function F considered in Example 6(iii), belongs toGand is generated by the function f given byf(y)={1ify=1,y/2otherwise.In this paper, we have proposed and discussed fusion functions based discrete Choquet-like integrals generalizing the discrete Choquet integral. We have shown that in the framework of n-ary aggregation functions, for any fixed n > 2 our F-based discrete Choquet-like integral is in fact a Choquet integral, but the underlying capacity m must be appropriately modified. Note that forn=2,our approach generates a new kind of binary aggregation functions. Interesting cases are also those which lead to F-based discrete Choquet-like integrals that are weakly monotone pre-aggregation functions. Considering a symmetric capacitym∈Mn(i.e., such that m(E) depends on the cardinality card(E) only) results in a symmetric F-based discrete Choquet-like integral which can be viewed as a new generalization of OWA operators (Yager, 1988). Recall that in the binary case, an OWA operator OWA: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] is given byOWA(x,y)=(1−a)min{x,y}+amax{x,y}=min{x,y}+a|x−y|for some a ∈ [0, 1], while an F-based symmetric discrete Choquet-like integral is given byCmF(x,y)=min{x,y}+F(|x−y|,a).Our approach can also be used for the generalization of the discrete symmetric Choquet integral (discrete Šipoš integral; Šipoš, 1979), as well as the discrete asymmetric Choquet integral (Denneberg, 1994). Observe that then one should deal with generalization of the formCmF(x+)−CmF(x−)in the case of the symmetric Choquet integral, and withCmF(x+)−CmdF(x−)in the case of the asymmetric Choquet integral, where mdis the capacity dual to m,x∈[−1,1]n,x+=(max{x1,0},…,max{xn,0})∈[0,1]nandx−=(max{−x1,0},…,max{−xn,0})∈[0,1]n.In the future, we intend to study an F-based generalization of the Choquet integral acting on an arbitrary measurable space. The basic idea is the approximation of the integrand f by a simple function fn, and subsequent processing of this simple function fnin the form of a discrete F-based Choquet-like integral.Finally, let us note that our theoretical proposal was motivated by practical problems in image processing. Moreover, we expect applications of F-based Choquet-like integrals in several domains of multicriteria decision support, especially in domains where the Pareto principle need not be completely satisfied.
