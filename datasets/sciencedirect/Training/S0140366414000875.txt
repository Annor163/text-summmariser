Traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are constrained by limited battery energy that powers the sensor nodes, which impedes the large-scale deployment of WSNs. Wireless power transfer technology provides a promising way to solve this problem. With such novel technology, recent works propose to use a single mobile charger (MC) traveling through the network fields to replenish energy to every sensor node so that none of the nodes will run out of energy. These algorithms work well in small-scale networks. In large-scale networks, these algorithms, however, do not work efficiently, especially when the amount of energy the MC can provide is limited. To address this issue, multiple MCs can be used. In this paper, we investigate the minimum MCs problem (MinMCP) for two-dimensional (2D) wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), i.e., how to find the minimum number of energy-constrained MCs and design their recharging routes in a 2D WRSN such that each sensor node in the network maintains continuous work, assuming that the energy consumption rate for all sensor nodes are identical. By reduction from the Distance Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), we prove that MinMCP is NP-hard. Then we propose approximation algorithms for this problem. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely used for structural health monitoring, scientific exploration, environmental monitoring, target tracking, etc. As sensor nodes in traditional WSNs are powered by batteries, the limited battery energy is considered as a major deployment barrier for large-scale WSNs. To elongate the lifetime of WSNs, many approaches have been proposed to harvest ambient energy from their surroundings such as solar energy [2], vibration energy [3], and wind energy [4]. However, due to the time-varying nature of renewable energy resources, the success of these methods remains very limited in practice.The recent breakthroughs in wireless power transfer technology [5], which allow energy to be transferred from one storage device to another via wireless with reasonable efficiency, has provided a promising way to solve this problem. Since wireless recharging can guarantee the continuous power supply and is insensitive to the neighboring environment, it has found many applications including RFIDs [6], sensors [7], cell phones [8], laptops [9], vehicles [10], smart grids [11] and civil structures monitoring [12]. With the novel technology, recent studies [12–18,1] propose to employ a mobile charger (MC) to replenish energy to sensor nodes in wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) [19–21] so that none of them in the network will run out of energy. Typically, the MC periodically traverses every node in the network and stays near every node for a short period to recharge it. Research results demonstrate that this approach works well for small-scale networks. For large-scale wireless sensor networks, a single mobile charger may not be enough. This is because the MC may not carry sufficient energy to recharge every node in a large-scale network on a single tour. Therefore, the MC needs to return to the base station after recharging a part of the network. As a result, single MC recharging algorithms become invalid and continuous working of sensor nodes can no longer be guaranteed.To recharge a large-scale sensor network, it is necessary to use multiple energy constrained mobile chargers. In this work, we investigate the minimum mobile charger problem for wireless sensor networks. That is, how to find the minimum number of energy-constrained MCs as well as their routes to recharge a given WRSN such that each sensor node in the WRSN can work continuously. In our problem settings, the energy consumption rate for all sensor nodes are identical, which is a practical assumption for many applications as will be elaborated. This problem is highly challenging as we should jointly consider the energy constraints of MCs and the time-sensitive charging requirements of sensor nodes when determining the routes of MCs. We prove the NP-hardness of this problem and propose efficient approximation algorithms to solve it. Zhang et al. [22] also employed multiple energy-constrained MCs. However, their work focuses on only one-dimensional (1D) sensor networks, and their goal is to maximize the ratio of the amount of payload energy to the overhead energy. Our solution is designed for two-dimensional (2D) sensor networks, and concentrates on an entirely different problem compared with [22].The contributions of this work are as follows.•We are the first to consider the minimum mobile chargers problem (MinMCP) in general 2D WRSNs, i.e., how to find the minimum number of energy-constrained MCs and their recharging routes given a 2D WRSN, so as to keep the network running forever.We prove that MinMCP is NP-hard, and propose approximation algorithms to address MinMCP. Particularly, we first consider the relaxed version of MinMCP, which is named MinMCP-R, and propose an approximation algorithm to address it. Furthermore, we present approximation algorithms to MinMCP based on the results obtained for MinMCP-R.We conduct extensive simulations to verify our analytical findings. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our schemes.
