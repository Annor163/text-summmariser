@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Using a ray tracing technique, we investigate the dependence of the moiré effect on the crossing angles between touch screen panels (TSPs) and display panels, the metal grid structures (spacing and width), and metal grid shapes (non-uniform and random grids). Of those design parameters, adjusting the crossing angle (∼45°), reducing the grid width (∼1μm), and employing a random grid in the shape of irregular hexagon are found to suppress the moiré phenomenon to a great extent. We also provide the simulation scheme that can capture the moiré patterns observed experimentally and useful design guidelines for metal grids.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The moiré phenomenon is induced by an interaction between the overlaid repetitive structures such as screens, mesh grids, or gratings [1]. It can be used for the measurement of noncontact profile, object movement, etc. [1,2]. In the field of printings and visible displays, however, it is a troublesome issue and thus should be avoided. For 3D displays, it occurs due mainly to the interference between grid structures of optical components and pixels [3–6]. Such a moiré effect was shown to be suppressed by placing grids at a certain crossing angle [6]. In the field of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, the moiré phenomenon appears due to the fact that condensed lights from optical films are spatially aliased by the micro grid structures of RGB openings (sub-pixels), which is known as a pixel moiré phenomenon [7]. It can be reduced by optimizing the prism pitch of a brightness enhancement film (BEF) [7]. Lately, as a replacement of indium-tin-oxide (ITO), metals such as chrome (Cr), silver (Ag), or copper (Cu) exhibiting higher electrical conductivity and electromigration resistance have been used in not only rigid but also flexible touch screen panels (TSPs). In addition, a printing technology instead of a standard photolithography process is demanded to reduce the fabrication cost. To ensure the optical transmittance (>85%) of TSPs, those metals must be patterned with the width of less than 5μm. In the case where the metal grid width is large, the moiré effect is inevitably generated owing to the interference between the metal grids of TSPs and the black matrix (BM) in display panels. To eliminate or at least minimize the moiré effect, a design of metal grids is of great importance. When metal lines are drawn on a computer screen with spacing similar to the pixel size in order to design metal grids, an aliasing also arises from the raster lacking the resolution to display the lines individually. As such, an optical design scheme is required to design and optimize metal grids. In fact, moiré interferometry is a well established technique and computer modeling of periodic grid layers is straightforward using Fourier transform [8]. For a system with random metal grids included, however, it is not applicable. In this case, 3D numerical simulations using ray tracing technique [9] are suitable for the systematic analysis of moiré phenomenon. Such a ray tracing technique can generate moiré fringes by tracing the path of light through grids. Although ray tracing entails a lot of computational efforts for the simulation of TSPs with random grids, it is capable of producing a very high degree of visual realism.The main purpose of this work is to provide the simulation scheme and useful guidelines for the design of moiré-less metal grids for TSP applications using a ray tracing tool [9]. The ray tracing simulation provides noise-like ray distribution, making it difficult to measure the period of moiré patterns. To resolve it, we have employed a smoothing technique by adjacent averaging. Due to the different human eye sensitivity, it is difficult to quantify the moiré effect from the image data. By way of simulation, however, it is feasible by calculating the number of rays detected on the receiver. Such information is not readily available in open literature. For a quantitative analysis of the moiré effect, therefore, we have also provided the way of quantifying it using the standard deviation (S/D) and contrast ratio (C/R) computed from the detected ray distribution. The next purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of random metal grids on the moiré phenomenon with the validated numerical simulation process. Furthermore, we have also investigated the dependence of the moiré effect on various design parameters such as the crossing angle between TSPs and display panels, the metal grid structures (spacing and width), and non-uniform metal grids.
