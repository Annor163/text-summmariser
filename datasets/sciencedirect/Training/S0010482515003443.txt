Development of a novel computerised version of the Month Backwards Test: A comparison of performance in hospitalised elderly patients and final year medical students

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We examined performance on verbal and computerised versions of the months backward test in medical students and elderly medical inpatients.Performance on the two versions of the months backward test was similar but with slower completion times and more errors on the computerised version.The computerised version of the months backward test had higher correlation with the MoCA, especially the visuospatial domain.The computerised version of months backward test can provide rapid and reliable testing of cognitive function in clinical populations.

Background and aimsThe Months Backwards Test (MBT) is a commonly used bedside test of cognitive function, but there is uncertainty as to optimal testing procedures. We examined performance among hospitalised elderly patients and cognitively intact young persons with verbal and computerised versions of the test.Participants and methodsFifty acute elderly medical inpatients and fifty final year medical students completed verbal (MBTv) and computerised (MBTc) versions of the MBT and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Completion time and errors were compared.ResultsThirty four participants scored <26 on the MoCA indicating significant cognitive impairment. The mean MoCA scores in the elderly medical group (23.6±3.4; range 13–28) were significantly lower than for the medical students (29.2±0.6; range 28–30: p<0.01). For the verbal months backwards test (MBTv), there were significantly more errors and longer completion times in the elderly medical patients (25.1±20.9 vs. 10.5±4.5; p<0.05). Completion times were 2–3 times longer for the MBTc compared to the MBTv (patients: 63.5±43.9 vs. students 20.3±4.4; p<0.05). There was high correlation between the two versions of the MBT (r=0.84) and also between the MBTc and the MoCA (r=0.85). The MBTc had higher correlation with visuospatial function (MBTc r=0.70, MBTv r=0.57). An MBTc cut-off time of 30s for distinguishing performance (pass/fail) had excellent sensitivity (100%) with modest specificity (44%) for cognitive impairment in elderly medical patients.ConclusionThe computerised MBT allows accurate and efficient testing of attention and general cognition in clinical populations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Automatic word sequences such as days of the week, months of the year and letters of the alphabet are universal to vocabulary [1]. These sequences are established through rehearsal and repetition during childhood [2]. Forward recall is ordinarily easier to perform and thought to test “automatic speech” in conditions with dysphasia or dyslexia [3–5]. Conversely, backward recitation draws upon a wider range of functions including the ability to focus and sustain attention, working memory as well as visuospatial imagery [2,6]. Neuro imaging studies indicate activation of more complex neural networks for backwards versus forwards recall of automatic word sequences [1,7–12] which are especially susceptible to the effects of aging and more likely to be impaired in the early stages of cognitive decline [1,2].The Months Backwards Test (MBT), also known as the months reversed or months of the year in reverse order test is a brief word sequence production test used to assess cognition [6]. The MBT has been documented as a test of attention [13–15], concentration [16], declarative and working memory [1], non-automatic speech [2], executive function [17], cognitive flexibility [18] mental control [1] and processing speed [19]. The test requires the participant to recite the months of the year in reverse order, starting with December and working backwards until they reach January or cannot continue [2]. The test is often undertaken at the bedside or in everyday patient consultations but can also be conducted over the phone [6]. Typically, cognitively intact participants are able to complete the test within 20s [6].Performance on the MBT is considered in terms of the ability to complete the test accurately without error and the time taken to reach completion [6]. MBT duration is extremely variable but highly correlated with accuracy [1,2,19,20]. Ostberg and coworkers found that it generally takes twice as long to recite the months backwards than the months forward [1]. MBT performance is impacted upon by educational attainment and age, with peak performance in the 30–60 year age group and thereafter an exponential relationship exists between MBT completion time and increasing age [2,6,19,21].The MBT is generally a simple test to perform and complete without error, so much so that poor performance or failure to complete the test is highly suggestive of impairment [6]. The MBT has excellent coverage with, for example, the majority of memory clinic attendees able to complete an assessment with the MBT [1]. Other work indicates that 89% of high school athletes and 92% of university athletes could complete the test without error׳ [19,22]. The test has been applied as a screening tool for delirium to determine the risk of delirium developing in hospitalised patients [23,24], in the assessment of mild cognitive impairment and dementia, in the evaluation of cognition in those with Parkinson׳s disease and to judge concussion severity in sports [1,12,21,25,26]. However, a recent review [6] highlighted considerable inconsistencies in the administration and interpretation of the MBT in clinical testing and concluded that computer-assisted technology could provide presentation platforms that minimise such effects. As such, we developed a computerised version of the test presented on a touch-sensitive tablet device that focuses upon visual presentation but with the same general rules for performance (i.e. identifying the months of the year in reverse order).This study examines how this novel computerised version compares with the standard verbal version of the MBT as well as with other tests of cognition in two contrasting groups – hospitalised elderly medical inpatients and cognitively intact young persons.
