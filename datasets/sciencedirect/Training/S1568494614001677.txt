@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Site selection is an important issue in municipal solid waste (MSW) management. Selection of the appropriate solid waste site is an extensive evaluation process that requires consideration of multiple alternative solutions and evaluation criteria. In reality, it is easier for decision makers to express their judgments on the alternatives by using linguistic terms, and there usually exists uncertain and incomplete assessment information. Moreover, decision makers may have different risk attitudes in the siting process because of their different backgrounds and personalities. Therefore, an attitudinal-based interval 2-tuple linguistic VIKOR (ITL-VIKOR) method is proposed in this paper to select the best disposal site for MSW. The feasibility and practicability of the proposed method are further demonstrated through an example of refuse-derived fuel (RDF) combustion plant location. Results show that the new approach is more suitable and effective to handle the MSW site selection problems by considering the decision maker's attitudinal character and incorporating the uncertain and incomplete assessment information.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Municipal solid waste (MSW) is the stream of solid waste generated by households, commercial establishments, industries and institutions, which consists of everyday items such as product packaging, grass clippings, furniture, clothing, bottles, food scraps, newspapers, appliances, paint and batteries [1]. The management of MSW is increasingly becoming a challenging task for the municipal authorities due to increasing waste quantities, changing waste composition, decreasing land availability for waste disposal sites and increasing awareness about the environmental risk associated with the waste management facilities [2]. The MSW management system can be thought to be a cycle with many closely related stages, which begins with the production of goods and continues with generation, storage, sweeping, collection and final disposal of waste [3]. Poor waste management systems coupled with hot climatic conditions result in increasing environmental problems with significant local as well as global dimensions [4]. Therefore, effective MSW management methods are desired to be developed, by which decision makers and waste management planners can deal with the increase in complexity, uncertainty, multi-objectivity, and subjectivity associated with the MSW management problem. In this paper, we focus on the final stage of the life cycle of MSW, i.e., the waste disposal.MSW disposal sites have been the focus of special attention because they are a significant source of soil, water and air contamination. Selection of the appropriate solid waste facilities constitutes one of the primary issues of municipal solid waste disposal. Optimized siting decisions have gained considerable importance in order to ensure minimum damage to the various environmental sub-components as well as reduce the stigma associated with the residents living in its vicinity, thereby enhancing the overall sustainability associated with the MSW life cycle [4]. In the past decades, a number of mathematical analysis methods were proposed for supporting solid waste site selection problems. For example, Şener et al. [5] combined analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information system (GIS) to determine the landfill site for the Lake Beyşehir catchment area (Konya, Turkey). Sumathi et al. [4] used multi-criteria decision analysis and GIS for optimized siting of municipal solid waste landfill. Wang et al. [6] proposed the use of GIS based on AHP to select sites suitable for disposal of solid wastes. Other methods of integrating GIS with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for waste disposal site selection include [7–13]. In [14], the analytic network process (ANP) was applied to select the best location for the construction of a MSW plant in the metropolitan area of Valencia (Spain). On the other hand, some fuzzy methods have been developed to deal with the vagueness and ambiguity in the site selection process. For instance, Ekmekçioğlu et al. [15] presented an approach based on the use of fuzzy AHP-based fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) methodology for the selection of appropriate disposal method and site for municipal solid waste. Önüt and Soner [16] proposed a combined AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methodology for locating and selecting candidate areas in the transshipment site selection process of the solid wastes. Chang et al. [17] suggested an integrated approach of GIS and fuzzy AHP to construct a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for the selection of landfill sites. Akbari et al. [18] also integrated GIS and fuzzy AHP to solve the landfill site selection problem and to develop a ranking of the potential landfill areas based on a variety of criteria. In Ref. [19], a fuzzy MCDM approach was applied to solve the landfill selection problem in Regina of Saskatchewan Canada. The techniques that were used for the analysis of solid waste management systems include simple weighted addition (SWA) method, weighted product (WP) method, TOPSIS, cooperative game theory, and ELECTRE.The above literature review demonstrates that the majority of researchers concentrated on site selection methods applying linguistic value by using fuzzy logic to handle the uncertainty in real situations. They usually deal with linguistic terms by using the extension principle [20] and the symbolic method [21]. As a result, an approximation process must be developed to express the results in the initial expression domain, since the computation results usually do not exactly match any of the initial linguistic terms. This produces a loss of information and hence a lack of precision in the final results [22–24]. In addition, decision makers are often unsure of their preferences during the site selection process because of time pressure, lack of experience and data. It is easier for a decision maker to describe a value for an alternative by using linguistic terms [16]. They often demonstrate different evaluations or opinions and produce different types of assessment information for a certain alternative concerning a given criterion, some of which may be precise or imprecise, certain or uncertain, and complete or incomplete. These different types of information are very hard to incorporate into the site selection by using the traditional models and fuzzy logic based methods. Whereas, the interval 2-tuple linguistic representation model [25–27] overcomes the above limitations. The advantages of this approach are that decision makers can express their preferences by the use of linguistic term sets with different granularity of uncertainty and their judgments can be expressed with an interval 2-tuple from the predefined linguistic term set. Therefore, the approach based on the interval 2-tuple linguistic variables is more flexible and precise to deal with linguistic terms in solving site selection problems in MSW management.In other way, the evaluation of a new waste disposal site is a difficult and complicated process and it requires taking into consideration many parameters (or criteria) such as distance to residential area, distance from the main roads, investment costs, climate, availability of solid waste, land slope, and so on [16]. In order to select the best disposal location of the solid wastes to be collected it is necessary to make balance among these tangible and intangible factors some of which may conflict and compete. Moreover, there may be several decision makers take part in the evaluation of alternatives together during the selection and the placement of waste disposal facilities. For these reasons, waste facility selection can be viewed as a group MCDM (GMCDM) problem and GMCDM methods have been found to be a useful approach to solve this kind of problem. The VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija i KOmpromisno Resenje) method, a very useful technique for GMCDM, was first developed by Opricovic [28] to solve a discrete decision problem with noncommensurable and conflicting criteria. This method focuses on ranking and selecting from a set of alternatives, and determines compromise solutions for a problem with conflicting criteria, which can help the decision makers to reach a final decision [29,30]. The compromise solution is a feasible solution, which is the closest to the ideal, and a compromise means an agreement established by mutual concessions. The main advantages of the VIKOR method are that it introduces the multi-criteria ranking index based on the particular measure of “closeness” to the ideal solution [31], and the obtained compromise solution provides a maximum group utility for the “majority” and a minimum individual regret for the “opponent” [29]. Due to its characteristics and capabilities, the VIKOR method has been widely studied and applied in group decision making problems in recent years [32–40].The background introduced above shows that it may be inappropriate to use fuzzy methods for evaluation and selection of waste disposal sites because of the loss of information in the linguistic information processing. Moreover, decision makers tend to use different linguistic term sets to express their judgments on the subjective criteria, and there usually exist uncertain and incomplete assessments. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present a new GMCDM method with interval 2-tuple linguistic information to solve the site selection problem under uncertain and incomplete information environment. The method is an extended VIKOR for group decision making with interval 2-tuple linguistic variables. It can overcome both the drawbacks of the crisp and fuzzy site section methods. Additionally, the risk attitudes of decision makers are taken into account in the assessments of alternatives to reflect different levels of optimism. In order to do so, the rest of the paper is set out as follows. In Section 2, some basic concepts of 2-tuple and interval 2-tuple linguistic variables are briefly reviewed. In Section 3, an extended VIKOR for group decision making is developed to solve the group multi-criteria site selection problem with interval 2-tuple linguistic information. A numerical example is provided in Section 4 to illustrate the developed methodology and the conclusions are drawn in Section 5.The 2-tuple linguistic representation model was firstly presented in [22] based on the concept of symbolic translation. It is used to represent the linguistic information by means of a linguistic 2-tuple,(s,α), where s is a linguistic term from the predefined linguistic term set S andαis a numerical value representing the symbolic translation. In other words, a 2-tuple linguistic variable can be denoted as(si,αi),si∈S, where sirepresents the central value of the ith linguistic term andαiindicates the distance to the central value of the ith linguistic term.In the 2-tuple linguistic approach proposed by Herrera and Martínez [22], the range ofβis between 0 and g, which is relevant to the granularity of the linguistic term sets. Here,βis the result of an aggregation of the indices of a set of labels assessed in a linguistic term set S. For overcoming the restriction, Chen and Tai [41] proposed a generalized 2-tuple linguistic model and translation functions.Definition 1LetS={s0,s1,…,sg}be a linguistic term set andβ∈[0,1]a value representing the result of a symbolic aggregation operation. Then the generalized translation functionΔused to obtain the 2-tuple linguistic variable equivalent toβcan be defined as follows [41,42]:(1)Δ:[0,1]→S×−12g,12g(2)Δ(β)=(si,α),withsi,i=round(β⋅g)α=β−ig,α∈−12g,12gwhereround(⋅)is the usual rounding operation, sihas the closest index label toβandαis the value of the symbolic translation. The interval ofαis determined by the number of linguistic terms in S.SupposeS={s0,s1,…,s6}be a linguistic term set, then g=6 andα∈[−0.083,0.083). If the result of a symbolic aggregation operation β=0.56, then the representation of this counting of information by means of a 2-tuple will beΔ(0.56)=(s3,0.06). Fig. 1shows the graphical representation of the transformation.LetS={s0,s1,…,sg}be a linguistic term set and(si,α)be a 2-tuple. There exists a functionΔ−1, which is able to convert a 2-tuple linguistic variable into its equivalent numerical valueβ∈[0,1]. The reverse functionΔ−1is defined as follows [41,42]:(3)Δ−1:S×−12g,12g→[0,1],(4)Δ−1(si,α)=ig+α=β.In addition, the conversion of a linguistic term into a linguistic 2-tuple consists of adding a value 0 as symbolic translation [22]:(5)si∈S⇒(si,0).The comparison of linguistic information represented by 2-tuples is carried out according to an ordinary lexicographic order.Let(si,α1)and(sj,α2)be two 2-tuples, then [22]:(1)If i<j then(si,α1)is smaller than(sj,α2);If i=j then(a)if α1=α2 then(si,α1)is equal to(sj,α2);if α1<α2 then(si,α1)is smaller than(sj,α2);if α1>α2 then(si,α1)is bigger than(sj,α2).In the process of 2-tuple linguistic operation, both functionsΔandΔ−1are used to ensure the operation of 2-tuple linguistic variables can be a 2-tuple without any information loss.LetX={(r1,α1),(r2,α2),…,(rn,αn)}be a set of 2-tuples andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe their associated weights, withwi∈[0,1],i=1,2,…,n,∑j=1nwi=1. The 2-tuple weighted average (TWA) is defined as [22]:(6)TWA(X)=Δ1n∑i=1nwiΔ−1(ri,αi)=Δ1n∑i=1nwiβi.LetX={(r1,α1),(r2,α2),…,(rn,αn)}be a set of 2-tuples andw=((w1,αw1),(w2,αw2),…,(wn,αwn))Tbe their associated 2-tuple weights. The 2-tuple linguistic weighted average (TLWA) is defined as [43]:(7)TLWA(X)=Δ∑i=1nΔ−1(wi,αwi)⋅Δ−1(ri,αi)∑i=1nΔ−1(wi,αwi)=Δ∑i=1nβwi⋅βi∑i=1nβwi.Based on the definitions of [41], Zhang [25] put forward an interval 2-tuple linguistic representation model, as a generalization of the 2-tuple linguistic variable.Definition 6LetS={s0,s1,…,sg}be a linguistic term set. An interval 2-tuple linguistic variable is composed of two 2-tuples, denoted by[(si,α1),(sj,α2)], wherei≤jandα1≤α2,si(sj)andα1(α2)represent the linguistic label of the predefined linguistic term set S and the symbolic translation, respectively. The interval 2-tuple that expresses the equivalent information to an interval value[β1,β2](β1,β2∈[0,1],β1≤β2)is derived by the following function [25,26]:(8)Δ[β1,β2]=[(si,α1),(sj,α2)]withsi,i=round(β1⋅g)sj,j=round(β2⋅g)α1=β1−ig,α1∈−12g,12gα2=β2−jg,α2∈−12g,12g.On the contrary, there is always a functionΔ−1such that an interval 2-tuple can be converted into an interval value[β1,β2](β1,β2∈[0,1],β1≤β2)as follows:(9)Δ−1[(si,α1),(sj,α2)]=ig+α1,jg+α2=[β1,β2].Specially, ifsi=sjandα1=α2, then the interval 2-tuple linguistic variable reduces to a 2-tuple linguistic variable.The decision maker's attitudinal character in decision making problems with information represented via interval 2-tuples is implemented on the basis of the score and accuracy functions defined as follows.For an interval 2-tuplea˜=[(si,α1),(sj,α2)], its score functionS(a˜)and accuracy functionH(a˜)are expressed by the following formulas [25,26]:(10)S(a˜)=i+j2g+α1+α22=β1+β22(11)H(a˜)=j−ig+(α2−α1)=β2−β1where g+1 is the cardinality of S. It is easy to prove that0≤S(a˜)≤1and0≤H(a˜)≤1. Then, the procedure for incorporating a risk attitude of each decision maker to the corresponding interval 2-tuples for the decision making is listed as follows.LetS={s0,s1,…,sg}be a linguistic term set anda˜=[(si,α1),(sj,α2)]is an interval 2-tuple. Then the interval 2-tuple linguistic variable can be transferred into a 2-tuple linguistic variable as follows:(12)aˆ=Δ(S(a˜)+ε⋅H(a˜))whereε∈[−0.5,0.5]is a number value representing the risk attitude of decision maker. If the decision maker is risk averse, then the range of risk factor will be−0.5≤ε<0; if the decision maker is risk neutral, then the risk factorε=0. While the decision maker is risk seeking, then the range of risk factor will be0<ε≤0.5.Establishing an applicable MSW site evaluation mechanism is obviously very important for municipalities even as the foregoing. However, in practical situations, most of the selection criteria are intangible and it is difficult to provide precise values for the criteria and to make evaluations which exactly convey the feeling and recognition of objects for decision makers. Thus, decision makers usually tend to use linguistic terms to express their opinions and to evaluate the alternatives’ suitability for various subjective criteria and the weights of the criteria. Moreover, decision makers often have different risk attitudes like optimistic or pessimistic from one to another and produce different types of assessment information because of their different expertise and backgrounds. Interval 2-tuple linguistic variables are appropriate for decision makers or experts to evaluate the performance of candidate sites in suchlike predicaments. Therefore, an attitudinal-based interval 2-tuple linguistic VIKOR (ITL-VIKOR) model is proposed in this paper for the selection appropriate disposal location for municipal solid waste. The advantage of the proposed method is that it has capability of representing vague, uncertain and incomplete qualitative data and presenting all possible results with different uncertainty degrees, i.e., using the linguistic term sets with different granularity of uncertainty. The flowchart of the proposed model for siting MSW plant locations is depicted in Fig. 2.Suppose that a site selection problem has l decision makersDMk(k=1,2,…,l), m alternativesAi(i=1,2,…,m), and n evaluation criteriaCj(j=1,2,…,n). Each decision maker DMkis given a weightλk>0(k=1,2,…,l)satisfying∑k=1lλk=1to reflect his/her relative importance in the group decision making process. The risk factorεk(k=1,2,…,l)represents the risk attitude of the decision maker DMk, and|εk|≤0.5. LetDk=(dijk)m×nbe the linguistic decision matrix of the kth decision maker, whererijkis the linguistic information provided by DMkon the assessment of Aiwith respect to Cj. Letwk=(w1k,w2k,…,wnk)Tbe the linguistic weight vector given by the kth decision maker, wherewjkis the linguistic variable assigned to Cjby DMk. In addition, decision makers may use different linguistic term sets to express their assessments. According to distinct situations this paper defines four different types of linguistic term sets (Table 1) for decision makers to select appropriate linguistic variables so as to analyze.Based upon above assumptions or notations, the procedure for the extended VIKOR method can be defined as the following steps:Step 1: Convert the linguistic decision matrixDk=(dijk)m×ninto interval 2-tuple linguistic decision matrixR˜k=(r˜ijk)m×n=([(eijk,0),(tijk,0)])m×n, whereeijk,tijk∈S,S={si|i=0,1,2,…,g}andeijk≤tijk.Suppose that DMkprovides his assessments in a set of five linguistic terms and the linguistic term set S is denoted as:S={s0=Verypoor,s1=Poor,s2=Medium,s3=Good,s4=Verygood}.The linguistic information provided in the decision matrixDkcan be converted into its corresponding interval 2-tuple linguistic assessments according to the following ways:•A certain grade such as Poor, which can be written as[(s1,0),(s1,0)].An interval such as Poor-Medium, which means that the assessment of an alternative with respect to the criterion under consideration is between Poor and Medium. This can be written as[(s1,0),(s2,0)].No judgment, which means the decision maker is not willing to or cannot provide an assessment for an alternative with respect to the criterion under consideration. In other words, the assessment by this decision maker could be anywhere between Very poor and Very good and can be expressed as[(s0,0),(s4,0)].Step 2: Convert the interval 2-tuple linguistic decision matrixR˜k=(r˜ijk)m×n=([(eijk,0),(tijk,0)])m×ninto 2-tuple linguistic decision matrixRˆk=(rˆijk)m×n=[(rijk,αijk)]m×nby incorporating the risk attitudes of decision makers, where(13)(rijk,αijk)=Δ(S(r˜ijk)+εk⋅H(r˜ijk))i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n;k=1,2,…,l.Step 3: Convert the linguistic weight vectorwk=(w1k,w2k,…,wnk)Tinto 2-tuple linguistic weight vectorwˆk=((w1k,0),(w2k,0),…,(wnk,0))Tby Eq. (5), wherewjk∈S,S={si|i=0,1,2,…,g}.Step 4: Aggregate the decision makers’ opinions to construct a collective 2-tuple linguistic decision matrixRˆ=(rˆij)m×n=[(rij,αij)]m×n, where(14)(rij,αij)=Δ∑k=1lλkΔ−1(rijk,αijk),i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n.Step 5: Aggregate the criteria weights provided by decision makers to determine the aggregated 2-tuple linguistic weight vectorwˆ=((w1,αw1),(w2,αw2),…,(wn,αwn))T, where(15)(wj,αwj)=Δ∑k=1lλkΔ−1(wjk,0),j=1,2,…,n.Step 6: Determine the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the negative ideal solution (NIS) as:(16)r+=[(r1+,α1+),(r2+,α2+),…,(rn+,αn+)],(17)r−=[(r1−,α1−),(r2−,α2−),…,(rn−,αn−)],where(18)(rj+,αj+)=maxi{(rijk,αijk)},forbenefit criteriamini{(rijk,αijk)},forcost criteria,j=1,2,…,n,(19)(rj−,αj−)=mini{(rijk,αijk)},forbenefit criteriamaxi{(rijk,αijk)},forcost criteria,j=1,2,…,n.Step 7: Compute the 2-tuples(Si,αi)and(Ri,αi), i=1, 2,…,m, using the following equations, respectively:(20)(Si,αi)=Δ∑j=1nΔ−1(wj,αwj)⋅(Δ−1(rj+,αj+)−Δ−1(rijk,αijk))∑j=1nΔ−1(wj,αwj)⋅(Δ−1(rj+,αj+)−Δ−1(rj−,αj−)),(21)(Ri,αi)=ΔmaxjΔ−1(wj,αwj)⋅(Δ−1(rj+,αj+)−Δ−1(rijk,αijk))∑j=1nΔ−1(wj,αwj)⋅(Δ−1(rj+,αj+)−Δ−1(rj−,αj−)).Step 8: Compute the 2-tuples(Qi,αi), i=1, 2,…,m, using the following equation:(22)(Qi,αi)=ΔvΔ−1(Si,αi)−Δ−1(S*,α*)Δ−1(S−,α−)−Δ−1(S*,α*)+(1−v)Δ−1(Ri,αi)−Δ−1(R*,α*)Δ−1(R−,α−)−Δ−1(R*,α*),where(S*,α*)=mini(Si,αi),(S−,α−)=maxi(Si,αi),(R*,α*)=mini(Ri,αi),(R−,α−)=maxi(Ri,αi)and v is introduced as a weight for the strategy of maximum group utility, whereas 1−v is the weight of the individual regret. The value of v is set to 0.5 in this study.Step 9: Rank the alternatives by sorting the 2-tuples(Si,αi),(Ri,αi)and(Qi,αi)in ascending order. The results are three ranking lists.Step 10: Propose the alternative (A(1)) as a compromise solution, which is the best ranked by the measuremini(Qi,αi)if the following two conditions are satisfied:C1: Acceptable advantage:Δ−1(Q(A(2)),α(A(2)))−Δ−1(Q(A(1)),α(A(1)))≥1/(m−1),whereA(2)is the alternative with second position in the ranking list by(Qi,αi).C2: Acceptable stability in decision making: The alternative A(1) must also be the best ranked by(Si,αi)or/and(Ri,αi). This compromise solution is stable within a decision making process, which could be: “voting by majority rule” (when v>0.5 is needed), or “by consensus”v≈0.5, or “with veto” (v<0.5).If one of the conditions is not satisfied, then a set of compromise solutions is proposed, which consists of:•Alternatives A(1) and A(2) if only the condition C2 is not satisfied orAlternatives A(1), A(2), …, A(M) if the condition C1 is not satisfied; A(M) is determined by the relationΔ−1(Q(A(M)),α(A(M)))−Δ−1(Q(A(1)),α(A(1)))<1/(m−1)for maximum M.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Selection of the suitable site for solid waste disposal is a critical activity for establishing an efficient solid waste management system and is a complicated decision making problem for local governments, because it requires consideration of multiple alternative solutions and several tangible and intangible criteria. During the site selection process, it is often difficult to provide exact and crisp values for the selection parameters and to make evaluations due to the uncertainty of information and the vagueness of human recognition. Moreover, the selection of the appropriate waste disposal site is a group decision behavior. Decision makers often have different risk attitudes like optimistic or pessimistic from one to another and produce different types of assessment information because of their different expertise and backgrounds, some of which may be precise or imprecise, certain or uncertain, and complete or incomplete. In this paper, we focused on the siting problem in MSW management under uncertain and incomplete information environment. And an attitudinal-based ITL-VIKOR method for group decision making was developed to solve the MSW site selection problem. The applicability and benefits of the proposed approach were illustrated using an empirical example regarding sitting the RDF combustion plant in Istanbul. The results demonstrated that the proposed method for group decision making with interval 2-tuple linguistic information can effectively deal with the MSW disposal site selection problem under uncertain and incomplete information environment.
