@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In conjunction with the advance in computer technology, virtual screening of small molecules has been started to use in drug discovery. Since there are thousands of compounds in early-phase of drug discovery, a fast classification method, which can distinguish between active and inactive molecules, can be used for screening large compound collections. In this study, we used Support Vector Machines (SVM) for this type of classification task. SVM is a powerful classification tool that is becoming increasingly popular in various machine-learning applications. The data sets consist of 631 compounds for training set and 216 compounds for a separate test set. In data pre-processing step, the Pearson's correlation coefficient used as a filter to eliminate redundant features. After application of the correlation filter, a single SVM has been applied to this reduced data set. Moreover, we have investigated the performance of SVM with different feature selection strategies, including SVM–Recursive Feature Elimination, Wrapper Method and Subset Selection. All feature selection methods generally represent better performance than a single SVM while Subset Selection outperforms other feature selection methods. We have tested SVM as a classification tool in a real-life drug discovery problem and our results revealed that it could be a useful method for classification task in early-phase of drug discovery.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Traditionally, drug discovery process starts with the identification of the disease-associated protein [1] and then this process is followed by testing of the disease protein against thousands of known and new compounds to find lead compounds that can interact with the target protein and show the potential effectiveness against disease. These lead compounds can serve as candidates for the drug to be further analyzed in pre-clinical studies. Since thousands of compounds screened from compound libraries in this step, virtual screening (VS) can be used to search libraries in order to identify structures, which are most likely to bind to a target protein [2,3]. Since VS is a computational filter, which reduces the size of a chemical library to be screened experimentally, it can reduce time and effort in finding lead compounds and thereby saves money. Early-phase VS often employs to eliminate potentially unwanted molecules (i.e. inactive or toxic) from a compound library [4]. Therefore, machine-learning (ML) methods can be used for VS by analyzing the structural features of molecules of known activity or inactivity [5].The main issue in early-phase of drug discovery process is the evaluation of drug compounds. Hereby, drug compounds have been studied from different perspectives [6] including prediction of oral bioavailability [7–10], drug-like [11–18] and lead-like [19] compounds, number [20] and topology of rings [21], molecular frameworks [22,23] and fragments [14,24–28]. Over a decade, various ML methods have been applied to biology, chemistry and drug discovery [29]. Supervised ML methods such as linear discriminant analysis [30] and decision trees [31] were used to predict structural properties of compounds. Furthermore, logistic regression [6], Bayesian networks [11] or artificial neural networks [12] have been used to distinguish between drugs and nondrugs. In addition to the activity studies, principal component analysis, Bayesian networks, neural networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used in various chemogenomic studies [6].SVM is one of the most widely used ML methods. Recently, it is used in a variety of drug discovery applications. There are some studies tried to design new kernel functions for SVM to combine compound structures with other data [32–38] and transfer similarity calculations into a combined feature space [39–43]. In addition to kernel design studies, SVM was used to predict compounds with single-target activity [4,40,44–58] and multi-target activity [59–63], and different compounds properties [64–76]. Furthermore, SVM methodology was used to predict drug-likeness score for targets [77], target–ligand interactions [78] and protein–ligand binding affinities [79–81]. More detailed information can be found in Heikamp and Bajorath [29].In the present study, we applied SVM to a real-life drug discovery problem, particularly, the comparison of active against inactive molecules for screening large compound libraries. We built our SVM models with incorporation of various feature selection methods, including SVM/Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM/RFE), Wrapper Method (WM) and Subset Selection (SS). Additionally, to check for external validity of the study, we compared our results with literature in the field.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
As stated in previous studies [4,58], in early-phase of drug discovery, it is very important to eliminate potentially undesirable compounds, such as inactive or toxic molecules. Since there are thousands of compounds in small-molecule libraries, the filtering method should be both fast and effective. After a fast filtering method, virtual screening methods, such as docking, can be used as a next step in drug discovery process. In this study, we used four SVM models for a real life drug–nondrug classification problem. As our study revealed that data pre-process and feature selection are important steps in machine learning process since they increase the performance of the classifiers. Moreover, the results appear to show a better AUC value than one case of logistic regression [6]. Based on our findings, we can clearly state that machine learning classification methods, such as SVM, can be used as a filter in early-phase of drug discovery. The main limitation of this study was the relatively small sample size. The second limitation of the study may be related to the training set which was quite balanced. However, in practice, the number of nondrug-like molecules is significantly larger than that of drug-like molecules. This fact should be considered in the future works and further studies with larger data set are needed to validate our findings.
