@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Doppler rate estimation on coherent sinusoidal pulse train, which can be applied in the passive emitter location systems, is investigated in this paper. When the pulse repetition interval (PRI) is constant, a DFT-based Doppler rate estimation algorithm is proposed and its performance is briefly analyzed. In the case of non-constant PRI, a least-squares-fitting based Doppler rate estimator (LSFE) is proposed. The mean square error is computed in closed form and the threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed. The Cramer–Rao lower bound on Doppler rate estimation is derived whereafter, and is compared to the mean square error of the LSFE. Monte Carlo simulations show that when operating above the threshold SNR, the proposed approach achieves the CRLB. The threshold SNRs in the simulations are basically coincident with the theoretical values.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The problem of locating an emitter from passive measurements is encountered in a variety of radar and sonar applications. The location can be performed either by a single sensor [1,2] or in an array of spatially distributed sensors [3–8]. The single sensor solution has the following advantages: (1) there is no need to synchronize and transfer data between sensors; (2) its system configuration is simple; (3) it is easy to implement in real applications. However, due to relatively few measured information, it is more difficult to design corresponding algorithms for positioning, tracking and parameter estimation. Array with multi-sensor methods can be divided into two types: uniform linear array (ULA) and non-uniform linear array (NULA). For ULA, the restrictive condition that the element distancedshould be smaller than one half of the wavelength of the signalλlimits the size of the array. Consequently, antenna gain is limited and mutual couplings between the antenna elements significantly affect the performance. For NULA, whendis larger thanλ/2, the measured results may be ambiguous and extra ambiguity resolution operation should be performed. Multi-sensor solutions and single sensor solutions have their own merits and drawbacks. The applications where the size of the passive location system is limited can be of major interest in single sensor solution.There are several methods of position estimating. The standard method is based on bearing measurements at different points along the sensor trajectory, which is called the bearing method (BM) [9–13]. Another method is based on Doppler shift of the emitter frequency due to relative motion between the emitter and the observer. This method is called the frequency method (FM) [10,14]. If the motion locus is known, the position of a stationary emitter can be estimated from several frequency estimation values taken at different points in the sensor trajectory. The third method, which combines the BM and FM, is called the combined method (CM) [1,2] in the sequel. A research group of National University of Defense Technology of China investigates the single observer passive location algorithms and technologies in recent 20 years. Based on the conventional bearing method, they add new observed quantities, such as angle-of-arrival (AOA) rate and Doppler rate, and propose a novel method [15,16], which outperforms conventional methods in location and tracking accuracy and speed of convergence. With the continuous measured bearing and frequency parameters, the geolocalization is computed using conventional two-step methods (also known as decentralized methods) or one-step methods (also known as centralized methods). In this paper, we mainly focus on Doppler rate estimation used for geolocalization, detailed post-processing after parameter estimation can be found in [1,15] and other cross-citations of these two papers.FM and CM methods all need to measure frequency. The accuracy of frequency estimation must be sufficiently high because the Doppler frequency and Doppler rate are usually small. Since the transmitted radar waves are generally pulsed waveform and the scales of pulse duration are commonly microsecond (μs), the estimated accuracy from single pulse can hardly fulfill the requirements of the passive emitter location systems. As we know, accumulation of multiple pulses can improve the performance of frequency estimation. Multi-pulse frequency estimation algorithms can be divided into two types: non-coherent [17] and coherent [18–21]. The non-coherent algorithm consists of averaging the frequency estimates of individual pulses. Its accuracy is inversely proportional toNp, whereNpdenotes the observation time, or the number of pulses in this case. The non-coherent algorithm requires a long observation time before the emitter can be accurately located. When the number of pulses received by receiver is not so much or the emitter only transmits several pulses in one frequency point, the accuracy will be insufficient. This causes problems in practical application.In order to estimate range, radial velocity, and acceleration of a target accurately, coherent technologies are widely used in modern radar systems. Coherent pulses are portions of a continuous wave and so the phases from pulse to pulse are in phase with the original wave. Parameters estimation on returned coherent pulse train has been investigated in previous works. For example, joint estimation of delay, Doppler, and Doppler rate [18], measurement of range, radial velocity, and acceleration [19,20], frequency estimation from short pulses of sinusoid signals [21], etc.Since the carrier frequency and initial phase are prior parameters in radar, coherent accumulation can easily be implemented. In passive emitter location, however, these two parameters are unknown commonly. In order to use the coherent information in passive location, some extra processes should be taken. The Doppler rate-of-change (also called Doppler rate) of the signal received from remote emitter can be used for emitter location [15,16]. To this end very accurate frequency estimates are necessary.Frequency estimation from short coherent pulses of a sinusoidal signal was investigated in [22]. The Cramer–Rao lower bound on differential Doppler frequency estimate was derived in [23], where the threshold SNR was also analyzed. Doppler shifted estimation can then be obtained from the difference of the adjacent Doppler estimations, which belongs to a kind of indirection method. In fact, the Doppler shifted frequency can be extracted directly. Since there is no prior knowledge, the frequency of each pulse should be estimated first, and a coherent accumulation can be performed subsequently. The accumulation results of successive pulse contain the information of Doppler rate, which can be extracted by parameters estimation methods, e.g., maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) [24], discrete polynomial-phase transform (DPT) [25,26], least mean square (LMS) [27], and others [28,29]. When the PRI is constant, MLE, DPT, and Kay estimator [28] can be used. However when the PRI is varying (e.g., stagger, jitter, sliding, etc), least-squares-fitting (LSF) will be a good choice.In this paper, we investigate the Doppler rate estimation algorithm on coherent sinusoidal pulse train. First, we need to detect the pulses and measure the leading edge and trailing edge of each pulse. The methods proposed in [30,31] can estimate the leading and trailing edges under low SNR condition and can be used in our algorithm. When the PRI is constant, a Doppler rate estimation algorithm based on DPT is proposed, and the performance is briefly analyzed. In the case of non-constant PRI, a LSF based Doppler rate estimator is investigated. Then we derive the Cramer–Rao lower bound on Doppler rate estimation. Thereafter the mean square error of LSFE is computed in closed form and compared to the CRLB. The threshold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is also analyzed. In Section 4, we extend our algorithm to other forms of coherent pulse train. The coherent LFM (linear frequency modulated) pulse train is taken as an example. Finally Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the LSF estimator against the CRLB for various signal-to-noise ratios. A typical non-rectangular pulse shape, i.e., Gaussian pulse, is used in simulations to demonstrate the performances for non-rectangular cases.Consider a stationary emitter with coordinates (0, 0) and a sensor is moving relative to the emitter (Fig. 1). In this case, the delay that signals propagate from the emitter to the sensor is a function of time(1)τ(t)=s(t)/cwherecis the speed of wave propagation in free space.In very short time,s(t)can be approximated by a binomial [18](2)s(t)≈cτ0+v0t+α0t2/2wherecτ0,v0,α0are the range, radial velocity, and acceleration of the sensor, respectively, at timet=0. The typical value ofv0is from 0m/s to 7.9km/s and the typical value ofα0is from 0m/s2 to 500m/s2. Then the noise-free received signal can be modeled as(3)r(t)=∑pg(t−Tp)Apexp{j[2πfc[t−τ(t)]+θc]}wherepis the index of pulse;fcandθcdenote the radio frequency and initial phase respectively;ApandTpare the amplitude and starting time of the pth pulse;g(t)is the envelope of the baseband transmitted pulse with(1/TOT)∫0TOTg2(t)dt=1, whereTOTis the total pulse “on-time”, i.e., the pulse width. Assume thatg(t)is real, time-limited on the interval[0,TOT]and symmetric with respect toTOT/2. The duty cycleηis defined asη=TOT/(Tp−Tp−1).Substituting (1) into (3), the signal model becomes(4)r(t)=∑pg(t−Tp)Apexp{j(2πfRFt−παt2+θ)}wherefRF=fc−fc(v0/c),α=fc(α0/c)denotes Doppler rate, andθ=−2πfcτ0+θc.Consider the frequency measurement device to be a digital receiver of bandwidthWthat recordsNppulses from the emitter to be located. The local frequency of the receiver isfLF. Suppose that the receiver samples at or above the Nyquist rate,2W, and that the noise power within the receiver׳s bandwidth isσ2. Then the pulse train of discrete signal model appears as(5)r(n)=∑pg(nΔ−kpΔ)Apexp{j[2πfInΔ−παn2Δ2+θ]}+wp(n)whereΔ,fI(fI=fRF−fLF) andkpdenote the sample interval, intermediate frequency and first sample number of the pth pulse respectively.wp(n)is an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In passive emitter location scenarios, there is no a priori knowledge of the received signals, therefore, the receiver should detect the intercepted pulses and measure the leading edge and trailing edge of each pulse. In our derivations we assume that all pulses are detected and the leading and trailing edges are estimated without error. The performance will degrade when these two assumptions are not meet, which can be observed from the simulation results in Section 7.The signal of the pth pulse can be written as(6)rp(n)=g(nΔ−kpΔ)Apexp{j[2πfInΔ−παn2Δ2+θ′]}+wp(n)rp(n)can be viewed as a noise contaminated chirp (also called LFM) signal. Its initial frequency and frequency slope arefIandαrespectively. As the bandwidth ofrp(n)is usually very small compared tofIdue to Doppler effect, sinusoid frequency estimation methods can be used to estimatefI. By averaging the frequency estimates of all pulses, we getf¯=(1/Np)∑p=0Np−1f^I. Multiplied withexp{−j2πf¯nΔ}, the carrier can be removed fromrp(n)and the baseband signal can be written as(7)rBp(n′)=g(n′Δ)Apexp{j[2πfe(n′+kp)Δ−πα(n′+kp)2Δ2+θ]}+w′p(n′+kp)=g(n′Δ)Apexp{j(2πfekpΔ−παkp2Δ2+θ)}exp{j[2π(fe−αkpΔ)n′Δ−παn′2Δ2]}+w′p(n′+kp)wherefe=fI−f¯,n′=n−kp(n′=1,…,Ns)andNsdenotes the sample number of each pulse). Next we will show that in most cases, the termπαn′2Δ2is very small compared to2π(fe−αkpΔ)n′Δ. Letn′=NsandNsΔdenotes the pulse width and its value for pulse radar is usually from milliseconds to microseconds. For a typical scenario,NsΔ=10μs, the duty cycleη=10%, the pulse numberNp=10,α=500m/s2,Δ=0.1μs. ThuskpΔ=NpNsΔ/η=1ms. When SNR=0dB, the CRLB [40] of frequency estimation for a 10μs sinusoid pulse is 3898.48Hz, i.e.,RMSE(f′p)≥3898.48Hz. Then the frequency errorfesatisfies thatfe=RMSE(f′p)/Np≥1232.81Hz. Now we evaluate the terms2π(fe−αkpΔ)NsΔandπαNs2Δ2and find that(2π(fe−αkpΔ)NsΔ≈0.0774)âª¢(παNs2Δ2≈1.57e−7). Thus (7) can be simplified to(8)rBp(n′)≈Apexp{j(2πfekpΔ−παkp2Δ2+θ)}g(n′Δ)exp{j[2π(fe−αkpΔ)n′Δ]}+w′p(n′+kp)Taking the discrete Fourier transform of (8) yields(9)Sp=ApG[f−(fe−αkpΔ)]|f=0exp{j(2πfekpΔ−παkp2Δ2+θ)}+wp=ApG[−(fe−αkpΔ)]exp{j(2πfekpΔ−παkp2Δ2+θ)}+wpwhereG(f)is the spectrum ofg(t). The mean and variance ofwpare 0 andNsσ2respectively. Sincefe−αkpΔis close to 0, the spectral line atf=0is selected. Noting thatG[−(fe−αkpΔ)]can be expressed as|G[−(fe−αkpΔ)]|exp(2πfgkpΔ+φ), (9) can be rewritten as(10)Sp=A′pexp{j(2πf′kpΔ−παkp2Δ2+θ′)}+wpwheref′=fe+fg,θ′=θ+φ,A′p=Ap|G[−(fe−αkpΔ)]|.When the pulse repetition intervalTrΔ(Tris the number of samples within one PRI) is constant,kp=pTr, (10) will be(11)Sp=A′pexp{j(2πf′pTrΔ−παp2Tr2Δ2+θ′)}+wp.Spcan be viewed as a chirp signal and its amplitude, initial frequency, and frequency slope areA′p,f′, andαrespectively. Doppler rate can be obtained by estimating the chirp slope. Many parameter estimation methods for chirp signals have been proposed in previous works, e.g., Newton iteration algorithm [24], DPT [25,26], etc. Since the computation load of DPT is low and its variance is only about 7% higher than the CRLB at high SNRs [25], Doppler rate in (11) can be calculated by DPT. In [25], it is showed that the optimal delay for estimating frequency slope with DPT isτ=N/2for all SNR≥0.1831dB, whereNis the sample number of the chirp signal. Herein,N=NpTrΔ. In this case, the variance ofα^by DPT can be derived as (see Appendix)(12)Var(α^)≈(1+12NsSNR)96π2Δ4Tr4Np4SNRintwhereSNRint=NpNsSNRis the integrated SNR (SNR=A02/σ2is the SNR of the input signal, andA0is the amplitude of the signal). In the case of constant PRI, the estimate of Doppler rate is straightforward. In this paper, we mainly discuss the problem of Doppler rate estimation when the PRI is varying.When the PRI is not a constant, DPT or Newton iteration cannot be used to estimate Doppler rate directly. As can be observed from Eq. (10), the phase of noise-freeSpis a parabola, so the least-squares-fitting or linear regression can be utilized to extract three coefficients of the parabola. Steven A Tretter studied the frequency estimation of a noisy sinusoid by linear regression [27], he pointed out that whenSNRâª¢1, say, 8dB, Eq. (10) can be approximated by(13)Sp≈A′pexp{j(2πf′kpΔ−παkp2Δ2+θ′+εp)}.Sincef¯is the average of frequency estimates fromNppulses, its accuracy is comparatively high, therefore,feis relatively small. On the other hand,αis usually small too, then(fe−αkpΔ)Δ≈0(according to the typical values in Section 2,(fe−αkpΔ)Δ=1.18e−5≈0). Notice that|G(0)|is the pulse energy of the baseband pulse and related toNs. For example,|G(0)|for rectangular and raised cosine pulse shapes is equal toNs. For these cases,A′p=Ap|G[−(fe−αkpΔ)]|≈Ap|G(0)|=NsAp. Thus the SNR of (10) is approximately given bySNRp≈Ns2Ap2/Nsσ2=NsAp2/σ2, which impliesNstimes gain after accumulation. When the input SNR is not too low, say,SNR=10log(Ap2/σ2)≥0dB, the approximate condition can be met.Doppler rate can be obtained from the phase of (13)(14)ϕp=2πf′kpΔ−παkp2Δ2+θ′+εp.Unfortunately, the phase extracted from (13) is ‘wrapped’ modulo2π. If the principal value ofarg[Sp]obtained by using an inverse tangent can be unwrapped, the parameterαcan be estimated using linear regression techniques. Many phase-unwrapping (PU) algorithms have been proposed in the literature [32–38]. Among them, phase unwrapping for chirp signal is mainly discussed in [37,38]. In this paper, we use the PU algorithm proposed in [38]. After phase unwrapping, least-squares-fitting can be applied to estimate the Doppler rate fromϕp.Letc0=θ′,c1=2πf′Δ,c2=−παΔ2, then (14) can be rewritten as(15)ϕp=c0+c1kp+c2kp2+εp.LetQ=(ϕ1,…,ϕNp)T,R=(a,b,c)T,ε=(ε1,…,εNp)T, andP=[1k0k021k1k12………1kNp−1kNp−12], where in superscript denotes transpose operation, then (15) can be rewritten as(16)ε=Q−PR.Now we can get the estimate ofRby applying the least-squares-fitting to (16)[39](17)R^=(PTP)−1PTQ.Substitution ofPandQin (17) and expansion yield the estimate ofc2as(18)c^2=NpK1−K0∑p=0Np−1ϕpNpK2−K02wherek¯=(1/Np)∑p=0Np−1kp,K0=∑p=0Np−1(kp−k¯2),K1=∑p=0Np−1(kp−k¯)2ϕp,K2=∑p=0Np−1(kp−k¯)4. Consequently the estimate of Doppler rate can easily be obtained as(19)α^=−c^2πΔ2.Since least-squares-fitting is performed on unwrapped phase, it is necessary to discuss some key problems about phase unwrapping. When the PRI is constant, the unwrapped phase of (11) is(20)ϕp=2πf′˜pTrΔ−παp2Tr2Δ2+θ′+εpwheref′˜=mod[f′,TrΔ](hereinmoddenotes the modulo operation). When the error off′is somewhat large,f′TrΔmay be larger than 1. Due to the periodicity of trigonometric function is2π, the phase obtained by unwrapping operation will be as (20). Althoughf′˜may be not equal to the true valuef′,αcan still be accurately extracted. For example, when the SNR is 0dB and the sample interval is 10ns, the CRLB for frequency estimation of a sinusoid with 100 samples is 38.985kHz [40]. If the number of pulses in the pulse train is 60 (Np=60), the accuracy is aboutf′≈38.985/60kHz≈5kHzafter non-coherent accumulation. When the PRI is equal to 1ms,f′TrΔ≈5. It is clear that phase ambiguity has occurred. However, since we only concern the parameterα, as long as the second term inϕpsatisfiesπαp2Tr2Δ2<2π,αcan be extracted without ambiguity, which can be verified from the simulation in Section 7.When the PRI is constant, the error off′in (11) has almost no effect onα^. However, it is different for non-constant PRI. The true noise-free phase of (9) is2πf′kpΔ−παkp2Δ2+θ′, and the phase difference of adjacent pulses is2πf′(kp−kp−1)Δ−πα(kp2−kp−12)Δ2.kp−kp−1is changing due to non-constant PRI, then whenp≠q,2πf′(kp−kp−1)Δand2πf′(kq−kq−1)Δmay be in different cycles andαcannot be estimated correctly so thatf′should be known here. For a staggered PRI, the Chinese Remainder Theorem can be utilized to solve phase ambiguity and obtain the true value off′. However, stagger ratio used in radar may be large, say, 31/32/33 [42, 43], in this case the range of resolving phase ambiguity is very small. For other cases of PRI diversity (e.g., jitter, sliding), the Chinese Remainder Theorem will be inapplicable. We give a more general method for the estimation off′herein with respect to PRI diversity. Calculating the phase difference of two adjacentSpof (9), say,S1andS2, we get(21)atan(S2)−atan(S1)=2πf′˜(k2−k1)Δ−πα(k22−k12)Δ2+ε2−ε1≈2πf′˜(k2−k1)Δ+ε2−ε1wheref′˜=mod[f′,(k2−k1)Δ]. The approximation is due to the relation−πα(k22−k12)Δ2≈0. Then(22)f′˜^=Arg(S2)−Arg(S1)2π(k2−k1)ΔwhereArgdenotes the principal value of argument.f′will be(23)f′=f′˜^+l(k2−k1)Δ,l∈Zandlcan be determined by(24)maxl{∑p=0Np−1Spexp{−j2π[f′˜^+l(k2−k1)Δ]kpΔ}}.Expression (24) is a kind of searching method, similar to maximum likelihood searching for sinusoid frequency estimation. AlthoughSpis a chirp signal, its bandwidth (BW) is usually small (whereBW=αTO⪯¡l/(k2−k1)ΔandTOis the total observation time.), say, several Hertz, therefore,lcan be determined by (24) effectively. Sincelis an integer and the main error scope can be determined, the search scope needed will not to be very large. If the maximum likelihood-based frequency estimators are used, the frequency estimation variance of each pulse will be [40](25)Var{f^}=3σ22π2Ap2Δ2Ns(Ns2−1).The accuracy of non-coherent accumulation onNppulses will be [23](26)Var{f¯}=3σ22π2Ap2Δ2NpNs(Ns2−1).According to the ‘3σ’ rule,223σrule: for an observationxfrom a normally distributed random variable,μis the mean of the distribution, andσis its standard deviation. ThenPr(μ−3σ≤x≤μ−3σ)≈0.9973, which means 99.73% of the values lie within three standard deviations of the mean.the frequency estimation error lies in the region of values from the true frequency of more than three timesVar{f¯}. Thus the search scope oflcan be determined by(27)−9σ22π2Ap2Δ2NpNs(Ns2−1)<f′˜^+l(k2−k1)Δ<9σ22π2Ap2Δ2NpNs(Ns2−1)that is(28)floor[−9σ22π2Ap2NpNs(Ns2−1)Δ−f˜^′(k2−k1)Δ]≤l≤ceil[−9σ22π2Ap2NpNs(Ns2−1)Δ−f˜^′(k2−k1)Δ]wherefloor[]denotes the round operation which rounds a number to the nearest integer less than or equal to it, andceil[]denotes the round operation which rounds a number to the nearest integer greater than or equal to it.Once theLwhich maximizes (24) is found, the estimate off′is given by(29)f′^=f′˜^+L(k2−k1)ΔMultiplied by the complex coefficientexp{−j2πf′^kpΔ}, (9) is converted to(30)S′p≈A′exp{j(2πf″kpΔ−παkp2Δ2+θ′)}+w′pwheref″=f′−f′^. Nowα^can be obtained by phase unwrapping and least-squares-fitting.Since the noise termwp(n)is an additive Gauss white noise, the probability density function (pdf) ofr(n)can be written as(31)f(z;α)=F⋅exp{−1σ2∑p=0Np−1∑n=kp+1kp+Ns|r(n)−g(nΔ−τp)Apeiϕ|2}=F⋅exp{−1σ2∑p=0Np−1∑n′=1Ns[|r(n′Δ+kp)|2−g⁎(n′Δ)Ap×r(n′+kp)e−iΦ−g(n′Δ)Apr⁎(n′+kp)eiΦ+g(n′Δ)g⁎(n′Δ)AP2]}whereFis a constant which is immaterial in further development;Φ=2πfI(n′+kp)Δ−πα(n′+kp)2Δ2+θ; the pulse timeτp=kpΔandn′=n−kp.

Consequently the magnitude of180(AE−C2)iskp4, while forF1the magnitude isNskp3. Generally,Ns⪯¡kp, therefore,F1can be ignored. In the same way, the magnitude of2160(ACE+2BCD−EB2−AD2−C3)iskp6andNs2kp4forF2, thusF2can be ignored too. The CRLB offIcan then be approximated as(60)CRLB(fI)≈σ2(AE−C2)8π2Δ2Ns(ACE+2BCD−EB2−AD2−C3)and the CRLBs ofθandαcan be approximated respectively as(61)CRLB(θ)≈σ2[(CE−D2)+(Ns+1)(BE−CD)]2Ns(ACE+2BCD−EB2−AD2−C3)(62)CRLB(α)≈σ2(AC−B2)4π2Δ4Ns(ACE+2BCD−EB2−AD2−C3)When the amplitude and PRI are constant, the CRLBs of the estimated parameters are reduced to(63)CRLB(fI)=3[Tr4(Np2−1)(2Np−1)(8Np−11)+30Tr3(Np+1)(Np−1)2(Ns+1)+F4]2π2Δ2SNRint[Tr2(Np2−1)+Ns2−1][Tr4(Np2−1)(Np2−4)+F5](64)CRLB(θ)=3[Tr6(Np−2)(Np+1)(3Np2−3Np+2)(Np2−1)+F6]2SNRint[Tr2(Np2−1)+Ns2−1][Tr4(Np2−1)(Np2−4)+F5](65)CRLB(α)=90π2Δ4SNRint[Tr4(Np2−1)(Np2−4)+F5]where(66)F4=5Tr2(7Ns2Np2−6Ns2Np+6Np2Ns−Ns2−Np2−5)+30Tr(Ns−1)(Ns+1)2(Np−1)+16Ns4+30Ns3−5Ns2−30Ns−11(67)F5=5Tr2(Np2−1)(Ns2−1)+Ns4−5Ns2+4(68)F6=6Tr5(Np−2)(2Np−1)(Np+1)(Np−1)2(Ns+1)+Tr4(28Ns2Np4−60Ns2Np3+42NsNp4+14Ns4−15Np4−90NsNp3+15Ns2Np2+30NpNs2−13Ns2+90NsNp−29)+30Tr3(Ns+1)2(Np−1)2(NpNs+1)Tr2(Ns+1)(Np−1)×(28NsNp3+32Ns2Np−14Ns3−17NsNp−16Ns2+31Ns−13Np+29)−Tr(Ns+2)(2Ns+1)×(Ns−1)(Ns+1)2(Np−1)+3Ns6+12Ns5+14Ns4−13Ns2−12Ns−4Since the number of samples of each pulse is large, for example, for a MTI radar, with the pulse width 0.5μs,Nsis 50 when the sampling rate is 100MHz, and the number of pulses used for coherent accumulation is usually larger than 10, the ratio of the first part and the second part ofF4will meet(35Tr2Np2Ns2/30TrNpNs3)=(35TrNp/30Ns)âª¢1(whereTr/Nsis the reciprocal of duty cycle and usually larger than 10). The ratio of the first part and the third part ofF4will meet(35Tr2Np2Ns2/16Ns4)=(35Tr2Np2/16Ns2)âª¢1in the same way. In addition, the scope of the pulse repetition frequency (PRF, which is the reciprocal of PRI) is usually from several hundreds of Hertz to several hundreds of thousands Hertz, with the corresponding PRI from several tens of microseconds to several milliseconds. In such a time interval, the number of samplesTris sufficiently large, thus the ratio of the first item of (63) andF4is approximately equal to(16Tr4Np4+30Tr3NsNp3)/35Tr2Np2Ns2=(16Tr2Np2+30TrNsNp)/35Ns2âª¢1andF4can be ignored. Analyzed in the same way,F5of the denominator of (63)–(65) can also be ignored.CRLB(fI)is simplified to(69)CRLB(fI)≈3[(2Np−1)(8Np−11)+30(Np−1)(Ns+1)/Tr]2π2Δ2SNRintTr2(Np2−1)(Np2−4)when(30(Np−1)(Ns+1))/((2Np−1)(8Np−11)Tr)⪯¡1, (69) can be further simplified to be(70)CRLB(fI)≈3(2Np−1)(8Np−11)2π2Δ2SNRintTr2(Np2−1)(Np2−4)≈24(Np−1)2π2Δ2SNRintTr2(Np2−1)(Np2−4)≈24π2Δ2SNRintTr2Np2.Similarly,CRLB(θ)andCRLB(α)can be approximated as(71)CRLB(θ)≈3(Np−2)(Np+1)(3Np2−3Np+2)2SNRint(Np2−1)(Np2−4)≈9(Np2−1)(Np2−4)2SNRint(Np2−1)2(Np2−4)≈92SNRint(72)CRLB(α)≈90π2Δ4SNRintTr4(Np2−1)(Np2−4)≈90π2Δ4SNRintTr4Np4=90π2SNRintTO4whereTO=NpTrΔis the total observation time. From (72) we can deduce that the CRLB of Doppler rate estimate is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the total observation timeTOand inversely proportional to accumulation SNR, namelySNRint. ExpandingSNRintasNpNsSNR, we can observe thatCRLB(α)is inversely proportional to the input SNR, pulse width, and fifth power of the number of pulses. In a word, the most important factor isTO. Observing the CRLB of LFM frequency slope [25](73)CRLB(γ)=90π2Ns5Δ4SNRwhereγis the frequency slope of LFM, we can see that substitutingNsandSNRin (73) withNpandNsSNRrespectively yields (72).The mean ofα^is(74)E[α^]=−Np∑p=0Np−1(kp−k¯)2E[ϕp]−K0∑p=0Np−1E[ϕp]πΔ2(NpK2-K02)whereE[ϕp]=c0+c1kp+c2kp2, andE[]denotes expectation.

Next, we analyze threshold SNR of the LSFE. First, the frequency of each pulse is estimated by DFT-based (discrete Fourier transform) algorithms. Experience shows that, in DFT-based estimation, the most important factor affecting the goodness of the estimate is the output signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). The OSNR is defined as the ratio of the signal energy at the pointω=ω0(ω0is the maximum point of the DFT) to the noise energy at this point. The numerical results in [40] show that the threshold OSNR is about 13–14dB. Therefore, when the sample number of a sinusoid isNs, the following relation should be met:(77)10log10NsA02/σ2≥14.Then the SNR should meet(78)SNR≥101.4Ns.On the other hand, in order to apply the Tretter approximation [27] in (13), the SNR should be higher than 8dB, namely(79)SNRp≈10log10NsAp2/σ2≥8dBwhich means the input SNR should meet(80)SNR≥100.8Ns.Take the maximum of (78) and (80) yields the threshold SNR as(81)SNRTh=max{101.4Ns,100.8Ns}=101.4Ns≈25NsFrom (81), we can conclude that the threshold SNR is only dependent on the pulse width but independent of other parameters, such as the duty cycle, pulse number, and observation time. Since there isNstimes gain after coherent accumulation, the SNR needed for Tretter approximation is lower than the threshold OSNR for DFT-based algorithms, which implies that once the frequency of each pulse can be extracted accurately, the LSFE will work well.In this paper, we mainly focus on Doppler rate estimation on coherent sinusoidal pulse train, which has no phase/frequency modulation. In fact, the proposed method can be extended to radar signals with phase and/or frequency modulation. In this section, we extend our algorithm to coherent LFM pulse train, which is a typical frequency modulated coherent pulse train widely used in modern radar systems.Next, we directly give the Doppler rate estimation algorithm for coherent LFM pulse train without further derivation:1.Estimate the TOAτ^pand pulse widthT^pof each pulse.According to the property of a LFM signal, its autocorrelation functionR(τ)is a sinusoid and its frequency equals toγτ, whereγis the sweep rate of the LFM. The LFM pulses can be deinterleaved or recognized from the intercepted pulses.Estimate the frequencyf^pand frequency sweep rateγ^pusing the DPT estimator proposed in [25]. The means of frequency and frequency sweep rate can be obtained respectively, i.e.,f¯=∑p=1Pf^pandγ¯=∑p=1Pγ^p.Generate the local reference signal:sRef(t)=exp[j(2πf¯t+πγ¯t2)]The received signal is processed by quasi-matched filtering:The output of the quasi-matched filter can be written asSp=A′pexp{j[2πfτ^p−πατ^p2+θ]}+wpNotice thatSphere is similar to (10). Subsequently, our proposed Doppler rate estimation algorithm can be applied.Simulations are conducted to characterize the performance of Doppler rate estimator. One thousand Monte Carlo trials per SNR are used to compute a root-mean-square error of the Doppler rate estimates. The parameters of the transmission pulse train are assumed to be radio frequency (RF)=10GHzand pulse width (PW, also called pulse duration time)=1μs. The radial accelerationα0is3m/s2, i.e., the Doppler rate isα=fcα0/c=100Hz/s. The receiver converts the frequency to intermediate frequency (IF) with a frequency down-converter. In the simulations the IFfIis set to50MHz. The sampling rate is 100MHz, i.e., the sample intervalΔis 10ns.In the case of low PRF, three different pulse trains are used. Their PRIs are {1, 32/31, 33/31} ms, {1, 6/5, 27/25, 31/25} ms, and {1, 62/51, 53/51, 61/51, 58/51} ms, i.e., the stagger ratios areτ1:τ2:τ3= 31:32:33,τ1:τ2:τ3:τ4= 25:30:27:31, andτ1:τ2:τ3:τ4:τ5= 51:62:53:61:58, respectively. The stagger ratios are taken from [42] where they have been discussed in detail. The total pulse number for each train is 60, which means the period number of each pulse train is 20, 15, 12, i.e., the observation time are (31+32+33)/31⁎20ms≈61.94ms, (25+30+27+31)/25⁎15ms≈67.8ms, and (51+62+53+61+58)/51⁎12ms≈67.06ms, respectively. It is assumed that the TOA and PW of each pulse are known and the pulse shape is rectangular. The RMSEs and CRLBs are shown inFigs. 2–4.In the case of medium PRF, two different pulse trains are simulated. The PRIs are {96, 94, 92, 72, 70, 68, 57, 55, 53}μs and {50, 52, 54, 57, 60, 63, 67, 71}μs, respectively. The stagger ratios here are taken from [43] where the performance of radars using such stagger ratios has been investigated in detail. The total pulse numbers used in simulation are 450 and 480, which means the period numbers are 50 and 60, i.e., theobservationtimeis (96+94+92+72+70+68+57+55+53)⁎50μs=32.85msand (50+52+54+57+60+63+67+71)⁎60μs=28.44ms, respectively. It is assumed that the TOA and PW of each pulse are known and the pulse shape is rectangular. The RMSEs and CRLBs are shown inFigs. 5 and 6.The performance curves with the triangle sign in Figs. 2–6 are the results of constant amplitude cases. While the circle sign is corresponding to random amplitude cases and the varying slope is 1dB.The sample number of each pulse is 100 with the pulse width of 1μs and sampling rate 100MHz. From (81) we can get the threshold SNRSNRTh≈−6dB. As can be seen from simulation results, in the cases of constant amplitude, the threshold SNR is−6dBwhen the PRI is {96, 94, 92, 72, 70, 68, 57, 55, 53}μs, which is consistent with the theoretical value. The threshold SNRs for the other experiments are−5dB, close to−6dB. When the SNRs are higher than the threshold SNR, the accuracy are all close to CRLB. When the amplitude is fluctuating randomly, the threshold SNRs and accuracy in Fig. 2–4 are almost the same as the constant amplitude cases. For the latter two cases, however, the threshold SNRs increases for about 2dB and 1dB respectively.Although the number of pulses and samples used in the case of medium PRF is much more than that of low PRF, the accuracy of the medium PRF is slightly lower, compared to the low PRF cases. This is because the accuracy of parameter estimation for coherent pulse train is primarily determined by the total observation time, not the number of pulses and samples, which can be observed from the variance of the estimate (i.e., (75) and (76)) and the CRLB (i.e., (62) and (72)).Simulations are performed for cases where the TOA is unknown or the pulse shape is non-rectangular. InFig. 7, we compare the simulated results with the cases of known TOA and rectangular pulse shape. The Gaussian pulse is chosen as the non-rectangular pulse. As observed from the results, the threshold SNRs in TOA unknown cases are higher than that in TOA known case. The threshold SNR for Gaussian pulse is higher than that for rectangular pulse. When the SNR is higher than the threshold SNR, the accuracy for rectangular pulse with unknown TOA is closed to that of the case with known TOA. In the case of Gaussian pulse, the accuracy is about 2–3dB poorer than that of rectangular pulse.The performance of Doppler rate estimation for coherent LFM pulse train is shown inFig. 8. The bandwidth of the LFM pulses is 1MHz and other parameters are kept the same as the sinusoidal case. The impact of TOA and pulse shape on the performance for LFM is similar to the sinusoid case. The threshold SNRs for LFM are higher than those for sinusoid since one more parameter, i.e., the sweep rate of LFM, needs to be estimated. Notice that in Fig. 8, the CRLB for coherent sinusoidal pulse train is used. When there is no a priori knowledge of TOA and pulse shape, the CRLB for coherent LFM pulse train maybe closed to, but different from that for sinusoidal case. From the derivation of CRLB and performance analysis, we can see that when there is no phase/frequency modulation, the CRLB for Doppler rate is independent from the form ofg(t). But for LFM and other waveforms, this conclusion is no longer valid.
