@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Most of the existing results mainly concentrate on the convergence analysis and stability analysis of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the presence of ω∈[0, 1]. However, few existing works discuss the convergence and the stability of time-varying stochastic PSO swarm system from the perspective of the consensus. This paper firstly proposes an improved consensus protocol on the basis of the velocity and position equations of the canonical PSO algorithm, and transforms the dynamical PSO system into one new linear discrete-time system including random variables. Finally several important theorems concerning the mean square consensus are provided according to the existing important results of nonnegative random matrices, stability theory of large-scale system, etc. Furthermore, the boundary of consensus region is given to better select the parameters in PSO algorithm. Finally, numerical simulation results chiefly discuss the convergence analysis of each particle and demonstrate the effectiveness of the above-mentioned theorems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based metaheuristic approach method, originally developed by Kennedy and Eberhart [1,2], which imitates the social behavior of birds flocking and fish. The PSO algorithm has been widely and successfully applied in the fields of multi-objective optimization [3,4], dynamic and uncertain environment [5–7], IP network [8], etc.In recent years, there are a number of the theoretical works on the parameters selection, the stability and convergence analysis of PSO algorithm. And Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is essentially a random second-order linear system. The stability and convergence conditions of particle swarm system with the random parameters are analyzed and some important results are concluded by the dynamic stability theory. Clerc and Kennedy [9] mainly discuss the stability and convergence of PSO algorithm in the case of the constant transfer matrix, together with the constriction factor method and the corresponding parameter selection. F. Van Den Bergh and Engelbrecht [10] mainly study attractor position, particle trajectory of a single particle and the range of the inertia weight, acceleration coefficients under the conditions of different parameters. Trelea [11] analyzes and studies the convergence of PSO algorithm in detail from the dynamic system theory, and the analyses provide qualitative guidelines for the general algorithm parameters selection. Additionally, the author concludes the convergence condition and the convergence speed of the constant PSO algorithm. Kadirkamanathan [12] regard the particle swarm system as a nonlinear feedback system and discusses the stability and convergence conditions of the particle swarm system with random variables. Poli [13] and Luis [14] calculate the expectation value of the second-order position, the standard deviation of the particle swarm system and the parameters distributions under different parameters. Pan [15–17] takes PSO as a dynamic time-varying system and analyzes its sufficient stability conditions without Lipschitz conditions, and the inertia factor domain is expanded to (−1, 1). Jiang and Jin [18,19] mainly investigate the stochastic convergence of PSO system from the perspective of stochastic process. It is defined that the state sequences of a particle and swarm according to the mathematical model of PSO algorithm, and Markov properties of PSO algorithm are analyzed in [20].However, few existing works discuss the convergence and the stability of time-varying stochastic PSO system from the perspective of consensus problems. In recent years, consensus problems have also received increasing attentions from several communities of evolutionary computation, computer science, control and so on. In the fields of biological evolution, consensus problems are especially reflected in self-organizing aggregation of biological systems, such as flocks of birds [21], schools of fish [22], mammals [23]. Likewise, PSO system can reach consensus by its information-sharing mechanism. However, the existing researches on consensus problems of PSO algorithm mainly focus on the design of the consensus protocols. There are few studies on consensus problems of the standard PSO algorithm itself. In conclusion, it is of significance to study the stochastic PSO system in terms of consensus.The exiting works on the consensus have been focused on the stability and convergence analysis of consensus problems in multi-agent systems with fixed or changed topology, continuous or discrete time, low or high order, etc. Generally, one of the hot topics is the design of consensus protocol, which describes the interactions rules between multiple state variables and the approach of agents achieving consensus via the information transmission. Jadbabaie provides the linear model on the basis of Vicsek's nearest neighbor rule in [24], then he analyzes the effect of the graph connectivity on the consensus and proves that the rule can cause all agents to move in the same direction, however, there exists no a common quadratic Lyapunov function in this model. Olfati-Saber et al. [25] address consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies under two consensus protocols. A common Lyapunov function is proposed for convergence analysis. Li et al. [26] put forward a distributed consensus protocol for a discrete time-varying single-integral multi-agent system. Under fixed topology and communication noise, the authors in [26] further prove the mean square consensus by applying Lyapunov function. Particularly, it is not necessary that the balanced network topology for the construction of the Lyapunov function. Z. Li et al. [27] adopt an observer-type consensus protocol in terms of the relative outputs of neighboring agents and concern the consensus problem of a linear network system, whose communication topology contains a directed spanning tree. In addition, the notion of consensus region is introduced as the basis for protocol design in [27].It is well-known that swarm network systems are of high-order and uncertainties in the real world, so the consensus problem of high-order and stochastic system is one of challenging research problems, which has important theoretical and realistic significance. By using Schur orthogonal transformation, Gao et al. [28] convert the consensus problem of a high-order dynamic system into stability problems of a switching subsystem with special structure. And then some sufficient consensus conditions are established under a neighbor-based feedback protocol and a common Lyapunov function. Meng et al. [29] propose an iterative control protocol to solve the consensus problem of a high-order discrete dynamic multi-agent system with strong connected graph. It shows that the system could achieve consensus at any desired state. Xi et al. [30] study the consensus problems and achieve the sufficient consensus conditions of high-order linear time-invariant swarm systems with time-varying delays, where consensus problems are converted into simultaneous stabilization problems of multiple time-delayed subsystems with low dimensions by the state projection onto the two subspaces. Yu et al. [31] convert the high-order system matrix to the Metzler matrix with zero row sum by model transformation under certain conditions. It is proved that the system could achieve consensus asymptotically if the union of directed graph across finite switching intervals has a spanning tree in dynamic switching topology. Li and Zhang [32] consider average-consensus problem of discrete time-varying stochastic networks in uncertain communication environments. By using probability limit theory and algebraic graph theory, consensus conditions for this protocol are obtained under fixed and time-varying topology structures. The result of [32] shows that each individual state converges to a common random variable, whose expectation is right the average of the initial states of the whole system.Considering the convergence analysis on PSO algorithm by consensus theory, the main contributions of this paper are highlighted as follows.•Under the conditions of −1≤ω≤0 and0≤ϕi(k)≤1/η(1+ω), a class of PSO mathematical model is defined as the Negative PSO Model. The difference between the canonical PSO model and the Negative PSO Model is the range of inertia weight ω andϕi(k). This paper mainly analyzes the consensus problem of PSO system with negative inertia weight.On the basis of the Negative PSO Model, a stochastic PSO swarm system is constructed to prove the mean square consensus of PSO algorithm. Especially, by large-scale system stability theory and the weighted sum Lyapunov function, the consensus problem of PSO swarm system is converted into the stability problems of m subsystems. More importantly, the mean and variance of the common stochastic variable ξ* is quantized without the typical double stochastic requirement for the system matrix.The performance of consensus of PSO algorithm is studied by discussing the impact of system parameters on consensus problem and conducting simulation experiments. In particular, the boundary of convergence region is given.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section2, the consensus protocol and consensus problem of a special PSO mathematic model are introduced, and the dynamic stochastic PSO system with m particles is established. Furthermore, the PSO swarm network system is analyzed by constructing a corresponding Lyapunov function for the large-scale system in Section3. In the next section, the mean square consensus is proved and the convergence results are deduced for the above mentioned swarm network system. Moreover, the boundary of consensus region is given, and the impacts of system parameters on consensus are discussed by simulation studies in Section4, and the concluding remarks are given in Section6.Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is a biologically inspired algorithm motivated by a social analogy. Individuals, referred to as particles, keep a reference to two state information to guide the particles flight in each iteration. One is the personal best in which it has been so far, and stands for the influence of its own experience and knowledge; another is the swarm best in which all particles have been so far, and reflects the social–psychological tendency of individuals to emulate the success of other individuals.At any time k+1, the update equation for the ith particle in the canonical PSO algorithm is defined as follows:(1)vi(k+1)=ω·vik+ϕi1(k)·(pi(k)−xi(k))+ϕi2(k)·(pl(k)−xi(k))xi(k+1)=xi(k)+vi(k+1)which satisfies|vi(k)|≤Vmax, where i=1, 2, …, m. m is the number of particles; ω is the inertia factor;xi(k)is the current position vector of the ith particle;vi(k)is the corresponding velocity vector;pi(k)is the personal best position of the particle;pl(k)is the swarm best position among all particles;ϕi1(k)=c1·ri1(k),ϕi2(k)=c2·ri2(k)are random numbers with a specified distribution.Generally, there are some recommended parameter settings for the canonical PSO algorithm. Normally,ri1(k),ri2(k)are uniform random numbers in the range [0, 1]; c1 and c2 are acceleration factors to decide the magnitude, and the values of 1.494 are respectively suggested by Clerc and Kennedy [9]; the value of inertia factor is set between 0 and 1 in general, Clerc [9] recommends the value for 0.729, Pan extends the value range of inertia factor ω to (−1, 1) in [33].Compared with above canonical PSO model, the negative inertia weight should be considered by the special PSO model studied in the paper. In view of this obvious feature, the special PSO model with negative inertia weight is named the Negative PSO Model.Definition 1Any PSO models, whose ω andϕi(k)satisfy the following constraints, are defined as the Negative PSO Model(2)−1≤ω≤00≤ηϕi(k)≤(1+ω)η>0whereϕi(k)=ϕi1(k)+ϕi2(k)andPi(k)=(ϕi1(k)pi(k)+ϕi2(k)pl(k))/(ϕi1(k)+ϕi2(k)), η is a constant.Firstly, on the basis of the velocity update formula of the canonical PSO algorithm, this paper improvesvi(k+1)as the consensus protocol U(3)U=ω·vik+ηϕi1(k)·(pi(k)−xi(k))+ηϕi2(k)·(pl(k)−xi(k)).Furthermore, the Negative PSO Model can also be expressed as(4)U=ω·vik+ηϕi1(k)·(pi(k)−xi(k))+ηϕi2(k)·(pl(k)−xi(k))xi(k+1)=xi(k)+UAs a result of (2) and (4),(5)xi(k+1)=(1+ω−ηϕi(k))·xi(k)−ω·xi(k−1)+ηϕi(k)·Pi(k).when η=1,vi(k+1)is the same with the canonical PSO algorithm, and the diagram of relationship between ω andϕi(k)is shown in Fig. 1. Compared with the existing researches about convergence of canonical PSO algorithm, consensus theories are only analyzed in Area C (ω∈[−1, 0],ϕi(k)<1+ω) in the case of η=1. In subsequent analyses, consensus problems under η≠1 is also be considered.As above mentioned, particle changes its own states according to certain strategy on the basis of the received neighbor information. Assuming one particle as one node and providing a weight for an edge between connected nodes, whenever the weight is non-zero, thus a weighted connected graph is obtained. It encodes all information transfer between particles and defines the interaction network. In short, the weighted connected graph reflects the PSO network topology structure. The properties of the graph are closely related to the ability of PSO swarm to achieve consensus. Kennedy [34,35] has already analyzed the topology of social networks on information transmission among particles. Universal interconnection, ring structure and Von Neumann architecture are typical neighbor graph that are widely utilized in the existing neighborhood topology structures.Universal interconnection network graph (see Fig. 2) is also known as the star social structure, in which each particle directly connects with all other particles. In another word, all particles share the common information from the swarm best particle and they are attracted to the same position. From the viewpoint of graph theory, this is a strongly connected structure, which is also adopted as the social network graph in the consensus study of this paper.Assumption 1Sequenceηϕi(k)is non-increasing, required to satisfy the following conventional persistent condition,∑k=0∞ηϕi(k)=∞.RemarkBy (2), −1≤ω≤0,0≤ηϕi(k)≤(1+ω), then0≤ηϕi(k)≤1is guaranteed. Furthermore, each elementηϕi(k)of the sequenceηϕi(k)satisfies0≤ηϕi(k)≤1for all k. Combining with the precondition thatηϕi(k)is non-increasing,∑k=0∞ϕi(k)=∞is obtained as a persistent condition.Based on the Negative PSO Model in (5), the vector[xi(k),xi(k−1),Pi(k)]Tis selected as the state vector of the ith particle at time k. Then, the linear discrete dynamic system model of the ith particle can be transformed into(6)xi(k+1)xi(k)Pi(k)=1+ω−ηϕi(k)−ωηϕi(k)100001xi(k)xi(k−1)Pi(k).The system (6) can be rewritten as a first-order discrete system(7)ξi(k+1)=Ai(k)ξi(k)whereξi(k+1)=xi(k)xi(k−1)Pi(k),ξi(k)=xi(k)xi(k−1)Pi(k),Ai(k)=1+ω−ηϕi(k)−ωηϕi(k)100001is the system matrix including stochastic parameters ω,ϕi(k)and η. Due to the time-varying acceleration factorϕi(k), the system is also a time-varying stochastic dynamic system.Furthermore, assumingξi(k+1)=xi(k)xi(k−1)Pi(k)=ξil(k)ξi2(k)ξi3(k),the Eq. (7) can be transformed into(8)ξ1(k+1)⋮ξi(k+1)⋮ξm(k+1)=A1(k)⋯0⋯0⋮⋯⋮⋯⋮0⋯Ai(k)⋯0⋮⋯⋮⋯⋮0⋯0⋯Am(k)ξ1(k)⋮ξi(k)⋮ξm(k).The mathematical model (8) can be rewritten as(9)ξ(k+1)=A(k)ξ(k)whereA1(k)⋯0⋯0⋮⋯⋮⋯⋮0⋯Ai(k)⋯0⋮⋯⋮⋯⋮0⋯0⋯Am(k)is a matrix of 3m×3m.Definition 2For a matrix A, A=[aij]∈RN×N. A is said to be nonnegative if its ijth element aij≥0 for all i and j. A is said to be linear stochastic if it is nonnegative and satisfies Ae=e, where e=(1, 1, …, 1)T.RemarkOn the basis of (2), it is obtained that(10)0≤1+ω−ηϕi(k)≤1−1≤ω≤00≤ηϕi(k)≤1Then, for the PSO swarm network system, every element of A(k) is non-negative and it satisfies A(k)·e=A(k). By Definition (2), A(k) is a linear stochastic matrix.In order to analyze the convergence of stochastic PSO system, the PSO mean square consensus definition is introduced as follows.Definition 3PSO mean square consensusThe stochastic PSO system is said to reach mean square consensus ifE[ξil(k)2]<∞, k≥0, i∈m, l=1, 2, 3, and there exists a common stochastic variable ξ* such thatlimk→∞E(|ξil(k)−ξ*|2)=0.Lemma 1[36]A[aij] is a stochastic matrix, if A has a eigenvalue λ=1 whose algebraic multiplicity is 1, the rest of eigenvalues satisfy |λ|<1. A is said to be a SIA matrix, that is to say, wherevsatisfiesATv=v,eTv=1, e=[1, 1, …, 1]T.Theorem 1The PSO swarm network system satisfies limn→∞[A(k)]n=1/m·e·πT, in which(11)πTA(k)=πT∑i=1m∑l=13πil=mwhere π=[πi1, πi2, …, πm3]Tis the solution of(11); i=1, 2, …, m; m represents the number of particles; l=1, 2, 3; l represents a state of particles in the corresponding number.Proof(1) The stochastic system model of the ith particle in PSO is ξi(k+1)=Ai(k)ξi(k), whereAi(k)=1+ω−ηϕi(k)−ωηϕi(k)100001is a linear stochastic matrix.Calculating the eigenvalues of Ai(k) according to the formula |λI−Ai(k)|=0, thenAll eigenvalues areλ1=1λ2=1+ω−ηϕi(k)−(1+ω−ηϕi(k))2−4ω2λ3=1+ω−ηϕ+(1+ω−ηϕi(k))2−4ω2Due to0≤1+ω−ηϕi(k)≤1and −1≤ω≤0,(1+ω−ηϕi(k))2≥4ωis always fulfilled, that means λ2, λ3 are real numbers and λ2>λ3. It holds that0<λ2=(1+ω−ηϕi(k)−(1+ω−ηϕi(k))2−4ω)/2<1under the condition of0≤ϕi(k)≤1. This implies that the eigenvalue λ2 satisfies |λ2|<1, and it can be deduced that |λ3|<1. In other words, λ1=1 is the eigenvalue of Ai(k) whose algebraic multiplicity is 1. By Lemma (1), Ai(k) is a SIA matrix and πi=[πi1, πi2, πi3]T, where πisatisfies(12)πiTAi(k)=πiTπi1+πi2+πi3=1(2) Ai(k) of other particles in swarm also meet Eq. (12), furthermore, the PSO swarm system satisfiesπTA(k)=π1Tπ2T⋯πmTA1(k)0⋯00A2(k)⋯000⋯000⋯Am(k)=π1TA1(k)π2TA2(k)⋯πmTAm(k)=π1Tπ2T⋯πmT.∑i=1m∑l=13πil=π11+π12++π13+⋯+πml+πm2++πm3.In conclusion, limn→∞[A(k)]n=1/m·e·πT, πTsatisfies (11).   □Lemma 2[37]Let S1, S2, …, Skbe a finite set of SIA matrices with the property that for each sequence Si1, Si2, …, Sijof positive length, the matrix product SijSij−1⋯Si1is SIA. Then, for each infinite sequence Si1, Si2, …, there exists a column vector y such thatlimj→∞SijSij−1,…,Si1=e·yT.Definition 4For a linear discrete time-varying system, the transmission matrix is defined as Φ(k, s), andΦ(k,s)=A(k)·A(k−1)⋯A(s)=∏t=skA(t). Then, the solution of a zero-input discrete system ξ(k+1)=A(k)ξ(k) is ξ(k)=Φ(k, s)ξ(s).Theorem 2The PSO swarm network system satisfieslimk→∞Φ(k,s)=limk→∞∏t=skA(t)=1/m·e·πT.ProofFrom Definition 4,limk→∞Φ(k,s)=limk→∞A(k)·A(k−1)⋯A(s)=limk→∞∏t=skA(t). Clearly, according to Theorem 1, it is true that limk→∞Φ(k, s)=1/m·e·πT.   □Theorem 3For all particles states of PSO swarm network system, the expected state weighted average summation invariance is preserved at each time.ProofDenoteξ(k+1)¯=πTξ(k+1),ξ(k)¯=πTξ(k). By (11), πTA(k)=πT, E[πTξ(k+1)]=E[πTA(k)ξ(k)]=E[πTξ(k)].That means the expected weighted average invariance is preserved at each time.(13)E[ξ(k+1)¯]=E[ξ(k)¯].□The expected weighted average invariance is preserved at each time, in view of Theorems 2 and 3, the existence of a suitable common Lyapunov function for the PSO swarm system is guaranteed.Lemma 3Stability theory of large-scale systemLarge-scale system is broken down into several isolated subsystems by utilizing decomposition technique, and subsystems synthesize large-scale system in certain associating form. Stability of large-scale system depends on the stability of each subsystem and relates to the connection between each subsystem. There are two approaches to analyze the stability of large-scale system, Lyapunov function method and the input–output method. The weighted sum of Lyapunov function method is a special separable system stability method in Lyapunov function. By analyzing the stability of each isolated subsystem and designing a Lyapunov function of each subsystem respectively, then a weighted summation of Lyapunov function of the synthetic system is defined as follows(14)V(x)=d1V1(x1)+d2V2(x2)+⋯+dmVm(xm).where the weighted factors d1, d2, …, dmare all constants, which respectively represent the influence degree of isolated subsystems on the stability of a large-scale system.For a single particle dynamic system, a positive definite matrixP=(I−πi·eT)D(I−e·πiT)is chosen, where the matrix D=diag{πi1, πi2, πi3}. Quadratic Lyapunov function of the subsystem isV[ξ(k)]=ξiT(k)Pξi(k)=ξiT(k)(I−πi·eπi)D(I−e·πiT)ξi(k).It is obtained by usingeT·D=πiT, D·e=πi,πiT·e=1that(15)V[ξ(k)]=ξiT(k)(D−πi·πiT)ξi(k)=∑l=13πil[ξil(k)−πiTξi(k)]2.This function V[ξi(k)] is a weighted distance Lyapunov function. It is not required that the double stochastic matrix Ai(k) for the existence of Lyapunov function (15). It is initially constructed in [26,38] to reach convergence of stochastic networks. In order to obtain the bound of V[ξi(k)], the proof to quantify the decrease of function V[ξi(k)] is fine-tuned as(16)V[ξi(k+1)]≤(1−σηϕi(k)πmin(m−1)2)V[ξi(k)]where σ>0, it shows that topology is the strongly connected graph, πmin=minπil.(17)V[ξi(k+1)]≤(1−σηϕi(k)πmin(m−1)2)V[ξi(k)]≤∏s=0k1−σηϕ(s)πmin(m−1)2V[ξi(0)]≤e−πmin∑s=0kηϕ(s)(m−1)2V[ξi(0)].Then, according to the assumption∑k=0∞ηϕi(k)=∞, there holdslimk=0∞e−(πmin∑s=0kηϕ(s))/(m−1)2=0.(18)limk→∞V[ξi(k+1)]=0.Therefore, the states of single particle dynamic system approach to their initial states and the system is stable. Similarly, there holds limk→∞V[ξi(k+1)]=0 (i=1, 2, …, m) according to (18). Each particle dynamic system is a subsystem of the PSO swarm network system, and swarm network system contains m subsystems. By utilizing the weighted sum of Lyapunov function method, the Lyapunov function of the PSO swarm network system is obtained that(19)V[ξ(k+1)]=V[ξ1(k+1)]+V[ξ2(k+1)]+⋯+V[ξm(k+1)].Supposing that the influence degree of each subsystem on the large-scale system stability is the same, the weighted factors d1, d2, …, dmare selected to 1.By (18), it is enough to show that(20)limk→∞V[ξ(k+1)]=0.Theorem 4For all particles in PSO system, all states of particles can converge to a common stochastic variable ξ*, andE[ξ*]=∑i=1m∑l=13πilE[ξil(0)], Var[ξ*] is bounded.ProofFor a stochastic variable, it is usually described by its numerical characteristics (mean and variance) and so on.(1) Firstly, this paper proves the existence of a common stochastic variable ξ* of PSO swarm system, and it has limited expectation.By Theorem (2),limk→∞Φ(k,s)=limk→∞∏t=skA(t)=1/m·e·πT, then(21)limk→∞E[ξ(k+1)]=limk→∞E[A(k)ξ(k)]=limk→∞A(k)E[ξ(k)]=limk→∞Φ(k,0)E[ξ(0)]=1m(∑i=1m∑l=13πilE[ξil(0)]·e).Along with Theorem 3,E[ξ(k+1)¯]=E[ξ(k)¯], the expected weighted average invariance is preserved at each time. Then,(22)limk→∞E[ξ(k+1)¯]=limk→∞E[ξ(k)¯]=1m∑i=1m∑l=13πilE[ξil(0)]=E[limk→∞ξil(k+1)].Meanwhile, according to the Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem [39], it follows that(23)E(limk→∞ξil(k+1))=limk→∞E(ξil(k+1)).According to the preceding derivation and Theorem 2, it shows that there exists a stochastic variable ξ* such that(24)limk→∞ξ(k+1)¯=ξ*E[ξ*]=1m∑i=1m∑l=13πilE[ξil(0)].(2) Variance describes the average value of static maximum mean square error between the state of each particle and the system initial states. Thus, it is proved that the variance of ξ* is bounded in the following.Choosing a variable z(k+1), letz(k+1)=ξ(k+1)¯−β, where β is an arbitrary constant. Then,(25)E[z2(k+1)]=E[(ξ(k+1)¯−β)2]=E[(πTA(k)ξ(k)−β)2]=E[(πTξ(k)−β)2]=E[z2(k)].Let β=E(ξ*), it follows that(26)Var[ξ*]=E[(ξ*−E(ξ*))]=E[(ξ*−β)2]≤E[z2(k+1)]=E[z2(k)]=E[z2(0)]=E[(ξ(0)¯−E(ξ*))2]=1m·E∑i=1m∑l=13πil(ξil(0)−E(ξil(0)))2≤maxi∈ΩVar[ξil(0)]wheremaxi∈ΩVar[ξil(0)]denotes the maximal variance of the initial statesξil(0). Thus, the bound of variance of ξ* is got and it is bounded.   □Corollary 1The swarm network system is said to realize the stochastic gradual consensus if the state of each particle in the PSO swarm system satisfieslimk→∞∥ξi(k)−ξj(k)∥=0.By Theorem 4, when k tends to infinity, the ith particle and the jth particle of PSO system respectively satisfylimk→∞ξil(k+1)=ξ*,limk→∞ξjl(k+1)=ξ*.It is obvious thatlimk→∞ξi(k)−ξj(k)=0, the swarm network system realizes the stochastic gradual consensus.Definition 5Steady-state disagreement error refers to the error between the current state of the moment and a consistent state for particles in the swarms system.By Theorem 4, πTξ(k) denotes the consistent state of each particle, then the steady-state disagreement error of system is defined as follows(27)e(k)=ξ(k)−e·πTξ(k).Definition 6[40]For a given vector X or matrix A, its D−norm induced by the positive definite matrix D is defined as(28)∥X∥D=XTDXor∥A∥D=ATDA.Denote D=diag{πi1, πi2, πi3}, by Definitions 5 and 6, the steady-state disagreement error of a single particle is∥ei(k)∥D=ei(k)TDei(k).Furthermore,ei(k)D2=ei(k)TDei(k)=[ξi(k)−e·πiTξi(k)]TD[ξi(k)−e·πiTξi(k)]=ξiT(k)(I−πi·eT)D(I−e·πiT)ξi(k)=V[ξi(k+1)].As a result, the Lyapunov function is also known as consensus error or deviation of the energy function.Lemma 4[41]Suppose u(k), a(k), b(k) andv(k)are nonnegative stochastic variables for all k≥0,E[v(k+1)|v(k)]2≤(1+a(k))v(k)−u(k)+b(k), where∑i=0∞u(k)<∞,∑i=0∞b(k)<∞, andE[v(k+1)|v(k)]denotes the conditional expectation. Then there holdslimk→∞v(k)=v*,v*≥0is a stochastic variable with a finite expectation value.By steady-state disagreement error, it shows that(29)ei(k+1)=(I−e·πiT)ξi(k+1)=Ai(k)ei(k).By the fact that(I−e·πiT)Ai(k)=Ai(k)(I−e·πiT),(30)V[ξi(k+1)]=∥Ai(k)ei(k)∥D2=eiT(k)AiT(k)DAi(k)ei(k).(31)E[V(ξi(k+1))|V(ξi(k))]=eiT(k)AiT(k)DAi(k)ei(k)≤(1−σηϕi(k)πmin(m−1)2)V[ξi(k)]=V[ξi(k)]−σηϕi(k)πmin(m−1)2V[ξi(k)].Let a(k)=0, b(k)=0,u(k)=((σηϕi(k)πmin)/(m−1)2)V[ξi(k)],v(k)=V[ξi(k)], then all the conditions of Lemma3are satisfied. By Lemma3, the following result holds(32)limk→∞v(k)=limk→∞V[ξi(k)]=v*≥0.Furthermore,(19) and (32)imply that(33)limk→∞V[ξ(k)]≥0.Then, combining with(20) and (33), it is finally obtain that(34)limk→∞V[ξ(k)]=0.Theorem 5The PSO swarm network system is said to reach mean square consensus ifE[∥ξil(k)∥2]<∞, in which k≥0, i∈m, l=1, 2, 3 and the common stochastic variable ξ*such thatlimk→∞E[|ξil(k)−ξ*|2]=0.Proof(1) Because of limk→∞V[ξ(k)]=0 andlimk→∞ξ(k+1)¯=ξ*, it follows thatlimk→∞(∥ξ(k)−ξ*·e∥2)=0.And the fact that∥ξil(k)−ξ*∥2≤∥ξ(k)−ξ*·e∥2holds, it is obvious that the particle state meetslimk→∞E(|ξil(k)−ξ*|2)=0.(2) A(k) is a stochastic matrix, each element of A(k) is between 0 and 1, ∥A(k)∥≤1.E[∥ξ(k+1)∥2]=E[∥A(k)ξ(k)∥2]≤E[∥ξ(k)∥2]≤E[∥ξ(0)∥2].Therefore, it implies that E[∥ξ(k)∥2]<∞. In other words,E[∥ξ(il)(k)∥2]<∞.From what has been discussed above, each particle in PSO dynamic swarm system can converge to a common stochastic variable ξ*, and it satisfies the conditions thatlimk→∞E[|ξil(k)−ξ*|2]=0andE[∥ξ(il)(k)∥2]<∞, the mathematical expectation of ξ* is the weighted average of initial states of the agents, and its variance is bounded. The PSO swarm network system is proved to reach mean square consensus.   □Under the conditions of −1<ω<0 and η=1, the consensus protocol U is equivalent tovi(k+1)of canonical PSO algorithm. In this case,0<ϕi(k)<1+ω, all states of particles could achieve consensus by Theorem 5. The consensus area (Area 1) is shown in Fig. 3.However, compared with the canonical PSO algorithm, the variation range ofϕi(k)is relatively small, and the consensus area is so small that the range of algorithm parameter is limited. Therefore, an improved protocol U is proposed andU=ω·vik+ηϕi1(k)·(pi(k)−xi(k))+ηϕi2(k)·(pl(k)−xi(k)). Under the improved protocol U, it is true that −1<ω<0, η>0,0<ϕi(k)<1/η(1+ω). The edge of consensus area is denoted in Theorem 6 according to the value range of η.Theorem 6−1<ω<0, under the protocol U, the consensus area is divided as(35)0<η<0.25Notcompleteconsensusη=0.25Thresholdofconsensusareaη>0.25CompleteconsensusProofUnder the canonical PSO algorithm,0≤ϕi1(k)≤2and0≤ϕi2(k)≤2, then0≤ϕi(k)=ϕi1(k)+ϕi2(k)≤4, which is also one of the convergence conditions of the time invariant PSO system. The protocol U is proposed on the basis of the velocity updating equation, and the constraint condition that0<ϕi(k)<1η(1+ω)is required for the stability of the stochastic PSO system.Let 1/η(1+ω)≤4, then0≤ϕi(k)≤4can be satisfied. It is required that η≥0.25(1+ω), in other words, η is not less than maximum value of 0.25(1+ω).Due to −1<ω<0, then 0<1+ω<1, 0<0.25(1+ω)<0.25, the maximum value of 0.25(1+ω) is 0.25. As a consequence, η≥0.25 and it is an important condition that PSO algorithm can converge under the improved protocol. But even more importantly,ϕi(k)=4(1+ω)is a consensus region boundary line in the presence of η=0.25.As shown in Fig. 3, if 0<η<0.25,0<ϕi(k)<1η(1+ω), then the area (Area 1+ Area 2) of0<ϕi(k)<4(1+ω)denotes complete consensus area, the area (Area 3) of4(1+ω)<ϕi(k)<1/η(1+ω)denotes inconsistency area; if η>0.25, the area (Area 1 + Area 2) of0≤ϕi(k)<4(1+ω)is completely consensus area.   □In order to verify the effectiveness of the consensus theory of PSO system, this paper chooses interconnection network graph as topology structure of PSO network, and the simulation experiments are carried out by test function Rosenbrock1. The number of all particles and the maximum epoch are set to 4 and 1000, respectively. In addition, the dimension of Rosenbrock1 is set to 20.Numerical results of the consensus on PSO algorithm are greatly dependent on the inertia weight ω, acceleration factorϕi(k), etc. In order to deeply investigate the relationship among them, sensitivity analyses of different parameter values are mainly introduced to investigate the relationships between the consensus and each factor. Additionally, the mean square consensus expresses the distance from the current state value to the final state value of particle, so the performance of mean square consensus (MSC) is defined as the value of|ξil(k)−ξ*|2to better explain Theorem 5. In the experiments, the influence of the state changes of a particle is described in the MSC simulation figures.The inertia weight ω satisfies −1≤ω≤0, when ω is equal to zero and ω is equal to −0.5, simulation results are as shown in Figs. 4–23.ResultsThe states of all particles change over time and the convergence velocity figures of particles are shown in Figs. 6, 9, 12 and 15. In the early iterations, all states of particles rapidly approach to the convergence state due to the parallel search ability and rapid search rate of PSO algorithm; in the later iterations, PSO algorithm search ability becomes weak and the convergence speed slows, all states of particles converge until the stagnation of the search. Compared with the consensus states of PSO algorithm under different values of ω, the analysis results are as follows:(1)When the inertia weight ω reduces, the range of the acceleration factorϕi(k)reduces due to negative ω. Exploitation ability of particles is relatively poor, the PSO algorithm needs several epochs to converge.When the inertia weight ω increases, the global search ability is relatively powerful, and then the particles of the PSO algorithm needs less epochs to converge into a common value, the consensus convergence speed improves.According to the Theorem 6, the consensus area is divided into three parts on the basis of the parameter η. The simulation experiments are conducted under three types of η.Under the condition of η>0.25, η is selected as 1 and0<ϕi(k)<1+ω. Simulation experiments are conducted when c1 and c2 is equal to 0.5(1+ω). Simulation results of particles states includingxi(k)andPi(k)are shown in Figs. 4–6and Figs. 7–9, respectively. In the end, the value of|ξil(k)−ξ*|2close to zero, all states of particles converge and the PSO system achieve consensus.Under the condition of η=0.25,0<ϕi(k)<4(1+ω), other parameters are chosen as: ω=0, c1=c2=2; ω=−0.5, c1=c2=1 and ω=−0.5, c1=c2=1.5. When ω is equal to zero, c1 and c2 are equal to 2, simulation results are shown in Figs. 10–12; when ω is equal to −0.5, c1 and c2 is equal to 1, simulation results are shown in Figs. 13–15. For all states of particles,limk→∞E[|ξil(k)−ξ*|2]=0holds and states of all particles could achieve consensus. In addition, when ω is equal to −0.5, c1 and c2 are, respectively, selected to 1.5,ϕi(k)is not in the scope of [0, 4(1+ω)]. Simulation result is shown in Fig. 16and all states of particles finally diverge.Under the condition of 0<η<0.25,0<ϕi(k)<1/η(1+ω). When η is equal to 0.1, simulation experiments are conducted and simulation results are shown in Figs. 17–19.ResultsCompared with theses figures of the consensus states of PSO algorithm under different values of η, the consensus results of the PSO system are discussed as follows:In the case of η=0.1, η∈(0, 0.25). The condition that PSO system can keep convergence is that0<ϕi(k)<1/η(1+ω). Under c1=c2=1,ϕi(k)=2, it can guarantee0<ϕi(k)<4(1+ω). It can be seen from Fig. 17 that all states converge and the results verify the Theorem 5, finally the system realize the mean square consensus. Under c1=c2=1.5 and c1=c2=2,4(1+ω)<ϕi(k)<1/η(1+ω), the results of Figs. 18 and 19 show that all states diverge in the late iterations and the system cannot realize the mean square consensus. And more importantly, the corresponding simulation examples are given to illustrate the validity of the Theorem 6.Under 0<η<0.25 and0<ϕi(k)<4(1+ω), the area (Area 1+ Area 2) denotes complete consensus area, the area (Area 3) of4(1+ω)<ϕi(k)<1/η(1+ω)denotes inconsistent state area.In the case of η=0.25,0<ϕi(k)<4(1+ω), states of all particles could achieve consensus. However, states of all particles diverge on account ofϕi(k)not in the scope of [0, 4(1+ω)].When η is equal to 1, then η>0.25,0≤ϕi(k)<1+ω, it can be seen from Figs. 4–8 that all states of the particles includingxi(k)andPi(k)finally converge and realize the mean square consensus. It is indicated that the area including Area 1 and Area 2 corresponding to0≤ϕi(k)<4(1+ω)is completely consensus area.The experiment results indicate thatϕi(k)=4(1+ω)is the consensus region boundary line in the presence of η=0.25. In conclusion, Theorem 6 provides the basis for parameters selection including η,ϕi(k), ω that can ensure the PSO system achieve consensus.   □All parameters including η,ϕi(k)and ω effect mutually to achieve consensus state. When the parameters values of η and ω are certain, then the range of parameterϕi(k)is determined and0<ϕi(k)<1/η(1+ω). The simulation experiments mentioned above are carried out under the case ofc1=c2=0.5ϕi(k), of which c1 represents cognition component of PSO algorithm and c2 represents social component of PSO algorithm. In other words, 0<c1=c2<1/2η(1+ω) can realize consensus under certain parameters selections of η and ω. Cognition component and social component serve the same impact on the PSO system consensus.By initializing the same states of all particles, two groups of experiments are conducted under c1=1.8, c2=0.2 and c1=0.2, c2=1.8. As depicted in Figs. 20–23, we can come to the conclusion that when c1 and c2 take different values, limk→∞MSC=0 and all states satisfylimk→∞E[|ξil(k)−ξ*|2]=0. All states of particles finally converge and realize the mean square consensus. In fact, the sum of c1 and c2 satisfies the condition of 0<c1+c2<4(1+ω), the PSO system could keep convergent and finally achieve the consensus under the common influence of two parameters c1 and c2. Due to different values of c1 and c2, cognition component and social component of the PSO algorithm only make a different contribution to the system consensus.
