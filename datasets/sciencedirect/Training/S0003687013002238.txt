@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Nowadays, many automobile manufacturers are interested in applying the touch gestures that are used in smart phones to operate their in-vehicle information systems (IVISs). In this study, an experiment was performed to verify the applicability of touch gestures in the operation of IVISs from the viewpoints of both driving safety and usability. In the experiment, two devices were used: one was the Apple iPad, with which various touch gestures such as flicking, panning, and pinching were enabled; the other was the SK EnNavi, which only allowed tapping touch gestures. The participants performed the touch operations using the two devices under visually occluded situations, which is a well-known technique for estimating load of visual attention while driving.In scrolling through a list, the flicking gestures required more time than the tapping gestures. Interestingly, both the flicking and simple tapping gestures required slightly higher visual attention. In moving a map, the average time taken per operation and the visual attention load required for the panning gestures did not differ from those of the simple tapping gestures that are used in existing car navigation systems. In zooming in/out of a map, the average time taken per pinching gesture was similar to that of the tapping gesture but required higher visual attention. Moreover, pinching gestures at a display angle of 75° required that the participants severely bend their wrists. Because the display angles of many car navigation systems tends to be more than 75°, pinching gestures can cause severe fatigue on users' wrists. Furthermore, contrary to participants' evaluation of other gestures, several participants answered that the pinching gesture was not necessary when operating IVISs.It was found that the panning gesture is the only touch gesture that can be used without negative consequences when operating IVISs while driving. The flicking gesture is likely to be used if the screen moving speed is slower or if the car is in heavy traffic. However, the pinching gesture is not an appropriate method of operating IVISs while driving in the various scenarios examined in this study.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In-vehicle information systems (IVISs) in automobiles are becoming more and more complex due to their increasing levels of functionality, which are related to multimedia services. IVISs include various functions such as navigation, music or video players, and TV, as well as standard radio or air conditioning controllers. However, multitasking such as manipulating IVISs while driving can cause interference between the primary driving tasks and the secondary IVIS operating tasks. For example, performing a search for music (Mitsopoulos-Rubens et al., 2011; Young et al., 2012) or navigation (Choi et al., 2013) while driving increased the amount of time that drivers spent with their eyes off the roadway and decreased their ability to maintain constant lane position. These types of interference might be heightened when the two tasks require the use of the same driving modalities (Brookhuis et al., 1991; Tsimhoni et al., 2004), i.e. the visual, auditory, cognitive, and physical dimensions. Thus, operating an IVIS while driving can divide drivers' attention, thereby degrading their performance in terms of both driving the car and manipulating the IVIS (Alm and Nilsson, 1995; Horrey et al., 2006; Janelle et al., 1999; Salvucci, 2001) and inducing accidents (Stutts et al., 2001). Therefore, many automobile design guidelines have recommended that manipulating several disruptive IVIS functions (e.g. scrolling through a map or searching for an address) while driving should be prohibited (CEC, 2007; Green, 1999; JAMA, 2004).Traditionally, touch screens or physical controllers such as hard buttons or knobs (e.g. BMW iDrive) have been used to operate IVISs. Recently, a touchpad located in the steering wheel has been used to improve the usability of IVISs (Kim et al., 2009). Also, many studies have focused on non-touch or touchless gestures based on vision techniques. Manipulating IVISs with non-touch gestures may cause less interruption to primary driving tasks, thereby lessening the task load and allowing the task completion time to decrease significantly (Karam and Shraefel, 2005; Karam et al., 2009; Pirhonen et al., 2002).In comparison with hard buttons or touch pads, touch screens are being applied in IVISs because they allow direct manipulation of devices. Moreover, operating with finger gestures enables interaction between users and interfaces to be more intuitive and efficient. However, touch screens may be cumbersome because of the lack of touch and kinesthetic cues, which are highly important in the safe control of cars (Burnett and Porter, 2001; Burnett and Irune, 2009). Lacking such characteristics, the operation performance on unsealed roads or conditions of high vibration will become impaired (Salmon et al., 2011). Particularly, touch gestures on touch screens have limitations because there are difficulties in providing visual cues and tactile feedback for the gestures on the screen (Stößel and Blessing, 2010). Bjørneseth et al. (2012) showed that traditional touch-screen button and menu interaction was quicker and less erroneous than multi-touch gestures in a safety critical maritime domain. Bach et al. (2008) demonstrated that controlling IVISs using touch buttons was more rapid and efficient than manipulating such systems with hard buttons or touch gestures. On the contrary, the study insisted that touch gestures demanded less visual attention from users. Alpern and Minardo (2003) showed that handling IVISs using simple touchless gestures, rather than working with the hard buttons, could allow drivers to focus more on their driving activities. Due to this benefit of the decreased demand on visual attention, many automobile manufacturers are beginning to apply touch or touchless gestures in the manipulation of their IVISs. In particular, touch gestures such as flicking, panning, and pinching are likely to be used widely in IVISs because such gestures are already widely used in smart phones and tablet PCs. Rydström et al. (2012) showed that a touch screen interface based on simple tapping operations was better for alphanumeric input tasks, but was worse for continuous adjustments and list scrolling. Touch gestures such as flicking and panning might make worse tasks better. However, the effects on safe driving of operating IVISs using these touch gestures remain unknown.In order to verify whether these touch gestures are appropriate for operating IVISs while driving, the following three aspects should be considered. First, each glance duration for a touch gesture should not require more than 1.5 s, so that drivers are not visually distracted from their driving task. Time is required to visually pay attention to IVISs during the performance of touch gestures, but not to cognitive or manual processing. Drivers tend to restrict their eyes-off-the-road-time to 1.5 s (Rockwell, 1988); the possibility of car accidents increases as this time increases over 2.0 s (Klauer et al., 2006; Zwahlen et al., 1988). ISO15005 also recommends that the time that drivers' eyes dwell on the IVIS should be less than 1.5 s (glance duration = transition time + dwell time; ISO15007-1, 2002). In particular, operating IVISs using touch gestures should not require drivers to pay continuous visual attention to the device (ISO15005, 2002). Therefore, an evaluation of the visual attention demanded by a device is essential in order to reveal the safety of using touch gestures while driving. There is a “15-Second Rule” that is a simple heuristic for evaluating attention load on a task (Green, 1999). This heuristic indicates that tasks that can be completed within 15 s in a stationary car may be safe without an increased risk of car accidents while driving.Furthermore, the visual occlusion technique is being widely applied for the evaluation of the visual demands in the automobile industry (Young et al., 2003; Stevens et al., 2004; Gelau and Krems, 2004; Foley, 2008). While driving, drivers' eyes primarily focus on the road and sometimes on the IVIS. While drivers keep their eyes on the road, they cannot watch the IVIS. Using the occlusion technique, this typical scenario can be simulated by occluding the participants' eyes so that they cannot continuously watch the device. The use of this technique is much simpler and easier than the development of a driving simulator (Young et al., 2003); furthermore, in order to compare the results of the current study with the experimental results from other studies, the occlusion technique is required because it enables comparisons of standardized experimental methods (Pettitt, 2008). Several studies have demonstrated that the visual occlusion technique is valuable in evaluating drivers' visual attention load because this technique resulted in loads similar to those found in real driving environments (Baumann et al., 2004; Gelau et al., 2009). Due to these benefits, the technique is occasionally used in the automobile industry in order to determine what functions should be allowed or prohibited while driving. When using the technique, Horberry et al. (2008) recommended that only younger/middle-aged participants (broadly 17–66 years old) should be used in the occlusion measurement in order to minimize inter-subject variability. Brook-Carter et al. (2009) suggested that the proper sample size was 14 in spite of the size's dependency on the variability of the occluded task; within-participant basis was more consistent than between-participants basis.Second, the touch gestures themselves should be intuitive so that drivers can imagine and recall them easily. For example, users can easily associate the ‘sweep up/down’ finger gestures with scrolling operations; in the same manner, they can also associate ‘sweep left/right’ gestures with the back or forward operations of touch browsers (Ecker et al., 2009). However, unlike the case of touch buttons, providing affordable and intuitive cues for touch gestures on a display is often not achievable because such gestures are not static but dynamic. For example, the zooming function in maps, in which users apply a pinching gesture, is not easily adopted without cues for the gestures; however, the visualization of certain cues on the map can become unnecessary and distracting after users learn the gestures. However, gestures such as flicking, panning, and pinching may be intuitively used in IVISs because such gestures are used widely in smart phones; thus, users already know these gestures without cues.Third, the hand or finger positions required to make the gestures should be comfortable. Generally, for smart phones or tablets, the users' wrists are not likely to be stressed because the angle between their wrist and the display surface is almost parallel. However, the angle of an IVIS display on a dashboard in automobiles is usually between 30° and 75°, thereby forcing the users' wrists to bend more when using touch gestures; users thus can become uncomfortable.The purpose of this study is to verify the safety and usability of operating IVISs using touch gestures while driving. For this purpose, an experiment was performed in which the three gestures commonly used in smart phones, i.e. flicking, panning, and pinching, were compared with simple tapping operations in standard IVISs. The participants performed tasks like scrolling through a list, moving a map, and zooming in/out of a map with two devices that could be operated only by touch gestures or common touch buttons. Then, the usability and safety of the flicking, panning, and pinching gestures were evaluated in terms of the abovementioned three aspects of visual attention, intuitiveness, and operational usability. In order to measure the visual attention load required for each gesture while driving, the visual occlusion technique was employed in the experiment. Initial gestures performed by the participants and their wrist motions were analyzed to evaluate the intuitiveness and usability of each touch gesture.
