@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper introduces the Weighted Uncapacitated Planned Maintenance Problem (WUPMP). Based on guaranteed maximum service intervals, the WUPMP pursues the finding of a maintenance schedule that minimizes the resulting total fixed and variable costs. One finding is that significant polyhedral attributes of its solution space are derived. Among them, quasi-integrality that allows for applying an integral simplex algorithm is proven. Moreover, we prove strongNP-hardness and propose an exact solution procedure that is polynomial if the number of considered maintenance activities or the number of periods is constant. Since at least one restriction applies to most real-world applications, the algorithm provides practical decision support. Furthermore, the complexity status of various polynomial special cases of the WUPMP is resolved.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Maintenance comprises all technical, administrative and managerial activities, which are carried out during the life cycle of a system in order to retain it in or restore it to a state in which it functions as originally intended (Comité Européen de Normalisation, 2001). Various studies show a positive effect of maintenance on the profit, the productivity, the quality, the overall equipment effectiveness, the service level as well as the efficient use of the system and of the personnel. These effects are mainly ascribed to significant improvements of the system reliability measured in a reduction of downtimes, failures, and maintenance costs (Ahmad & Kamaruddin, 2012). Maintenance strategies can be classified into two categories: corrective maintenance that is carried out after failure and preventive maintenance that performs activities prior to failure either according to prescribed criteria (condition based maintenance) or at predetermined intervals (planned maintenance). This study solely focuses on planned maintenance. By scheduling necessary maintenance activities in predetermined intervals, it pursues the minimization of the number of unexpected failures that may lead to costly production faults or stoppages. However, since maintenance activities block and consume resources, efficient schedules have to be determined. For this purpose, this paper introduces the Weighted Uncapacitated Planned Maintenance Problem (WUPMP) that pursues the finding of a maintenance schedule with minimal costs. A predefined finite planning horizon that comprises a predetermined number of periods is considered. In doing so, the WUPMP assumes the knowledge of a suitable set of different maintenance activities that have to be executed in individual intervals (denoted as coverages in what follows) that are measured in periods. If for each maintenance activity at least a single execution is scheduled during the coverage, the plan guarantees a maximal reliability and, therefore, is denoted as feasible. Note that the given coverages are assumed to be valid throughout the entire planning horizon. Therefore, technical obsolescence is handled by an iterative application of the model with modified parameter values. Depending on the considered application, maintenance activities may be defined for processes of lubrication, calibration, cleaning, repair, overhaul, replacement, or inspection of a specific facility.The WUPMP measures the resulting resource consumption of each scheduled maintenance activity by variable and fixed cost rates that may differ from period to period due to varying resource availabilities. While variable costs result from the respective maintenance activities that are executed, fixed costs of a period occur if at least a single maintenance activity is scheduled. For instance, variable costs comprise the consumption of all personnel and material resources that are caused by the execution of a specific maintenance activity. In contrast to this, typical examples of fixed costs are all resource consumptions caused by administrative activities that are necessary if at least one maintenance activity is scheduled.Potential applications of the WUPMP are, for instance, processes that have to guarantee a high degree of accuracy while downtimes or faults are extremely costly. Since the derivation of reliable data is one of the major problems in practice (Ahmad & Kamaruddin, 2012; Pintelon & Gelders, 1992), the applicability of stochastic approaches to such applications is strongly limited (Scarf, 1997). Reasons may be lacking knowledge or data, secrecy of some suppliers, or unexplored incompatibility problems between modules and the condition of the production system. In contrast to this, by referring to empirically estimated lower bounds on the coverages, expert knowledge, or given guarantees of suppliers, the requirements of the WUPMP can be fulfilled much more easily by a pragmatic derivation of deterministic service intervals. The aforementioned characteristics can be found, for instance, in the automotive industry. Due to the adoption of JiT policies and mass customization, production processes in the automotive supply chains have to fulfill high service level agreements for a large variety of product variants (Boysen, Emde, Hoeck, & Kauderer, 2015). A second area where the WUPMP is applicable can be found in the aircraft industry (Knotts, 1999). Production processes of aircrafts as well as flight schedules have to comply with various security restrictions that require inspection intervals to be fulfilled and critical components to be replaced. Moreover, while evaluating two exact solution approaches by a numerical study, Section 4 sketches a potential application of the WUPMP for oil platform maintenance.Aspects and attributes of the WUPMP are discussed in the literature. For instance, time-based maintenance policies (e.g. age-based replacement and block replacement) are presented in Barlow, Proschan, and Hunter (1965, pp. 84–118). Wagner, Giglio, and Glaser (1964) consider a deterministic preventive maintenance problem that schedules maintenance activities within a planning horizon. Each maintenance activity consumes manpower and is allowed to be scheduled in a predetermined set of periods while its processing time is measured in periods. The authors propose different objective functions. In the repair cost method of Drinkwater and Hastings (1967), preventive maintenance is applied to a fleet of vehicles. It is assumed that each vehicle has cumulative maintenance costs that consist of repair and of replacement. Through the decision of repair or replacement the approach minimizes the average cost per vehicle. Anily, Glass, and Hassin (1998) consider a deterministic periodic maintenance problem where the maintenance plan comprises a repeating sequence of minimal length while at most one machine can be maintained per period. Operation costs are assumed to increase linearly in the number of periods between two maintenance activities while maintenance costs are negligible. Grigoriev, van de Klundert, and Spieksma (2006) augment this periodic maintenance problem by considering maintenance fixed costs while pursuing the minimization of the sum of operation and maintenance costs. The deterministic maintenance scheduling problem proposed by Lee (1996) simultaneously considers machine scheduling and maintenance such that on every machine either a maintenance activity is performed or a job is processed. It is assumed that one maintenance interval per machine is fixed and known in advance. A job can either be preempted upon maintenance or not (resumable and non-resumable job processing). An analysis of the complexity of different problem variants that provides numerous optimal solution approaches for various alternative objective functions is given. An extension of this scheduling problem is provided by Chen (2008). In this approach two subsequent maintenance activities have to be scheduled within a predetermined interval. More recently, Bock, Briskorn, and Horbach (2012) integrate maintenance activities into single machine scheduling.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the mathematical model of the WUPMP. The polyhedral results of the WUPMP are derived in the following Section 3. Based on these findings, Section 4 analyzes the complexity status of various problem variants. Moreover, the applicability of two optimal algorithms is evaluated in a numerical study.This section provides a mathematical definition of the WUPMP with the following parameters:N: number of considered maintenance activities (index i).T: number of periods in the considered planning horizon (index t).πi: coverage of a maintenance activity i, i.e., πigives the maximum distance (measured in periods) between two consecutive executions of maintenance activity i. By assuming 2 ≤ πi≤ T ∀i, we prevent trivially solvable cases without maintenance or with at least one maintenance activity per period. All activities are numbered according to non-decreasing coverages, i.e.,πi≤πi+1∀i. All activities are assumed to be executed in the periodst=0andt=T+1.ci, t: variable costs of scheduling maintenance activity i in period t.ft: fixed costs of scheduling at least one maintenance activity in period t.A solution of the WUPMP is determined by the following variables:yt: binary variable indicating one or several maintenance activities in period t.xi, t: binary variable indicating an execution of maintenance activity i in period t.Based on these parameters and variables, we define the WUPMP as follows:(1)min∑t=1Tft·yt+∑i=1N∑t=1Tci,t·xi,tsubjectto∑τ=tt+πi−1xi,τ≥1∀i=1,…,N;t=1,…,T−πi+1(2)xi,t≤yt∀i=1,…,N;t=1,…,T(3)xi,t∈{0,1}∀i=1,…,N;t=1,…,T(4)yt∈{0,1}∀t=1,…,TA maintenance plan (x, y) with minimal total (fixed and variable) costs is sought. The period covering constraints (1) ensure that a maintenance activity i is scheduled at least once every πiperiods. Due to constraint (2), a scheduled maintenance activity (xi,t=1) requires a corresponding maintenance slot in period t (yt=1). We introduce the following simple upper bound constraints(5)0≤xi,t,yt≤1∀i=1,…,N;t=1,…,T(6)0≤xi,t≤1∀i=1,…,N;t=1,…,T.Table 1illustrates the cascading coefficient matrix of (1) with its stairway structure. Fig. 1and Remark 2.1 show how to transform (1) for maintenance activity i into a path finding problem.Remark 2.1The ith Restriction of (1) can be interpreted as a directed path from node 0 to nodeT+1in the weighted, directed graph Gi(V, Ei) with the node setV={0,…,T+1}and the arc setEi={(t,τ)∈V×V|τ=t+1,…,t+πi}. The nodes represent the periods1,…,Twith the additional distinguished nodes 0 andT+1. If the generated path uses an arc (t, τ) ∈ Ei, a maintenance activity i is scheduled in both periods t and τ. The weight of an arc (t, τ) ∈ Eiis independent of its starting node t and equals ci, τift+πi≤Tand, otherwise, 0.The WUPMP is closely related to two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, namely the Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (UFLP) and the Uncapacitated Network Design Problem (UNDP) that can be briefly described as follows: in the UFLP, the task is to find a feasible assignment of customers to facilities, which satisfy customer demands, at minimal total costs. Note that fixed costs per facility arise at most once and variable costs are paid for the assignment itself. The task in the UNDP is to find a feasible flow for a set of commodities at minimal total costs within a given weighted, directed graph. For each commodity, a unit demand has to be sent along a path from a source node to a sink node and flow costs are caused by every unit that is sent along an arc in the graph. Fixed costs per arc are caused at most once if the flow is non-zero. Polynomial reductions from VERTEX COVER for the UFLP and STEINER TREE IN GRAPHS for the UNDP prove strongNP-hardness (Cornuejols, Nemhauser, & Wolsey, 1990; Holmberg & Hellstrand, 1998).The WUPMP is a generalization of the UFLP, but a special case of the UNDP. More precisely, the UFLP polytope is included in the WUPMP polytope if we setπi=T∀i. The following Remark 2.2 sketches how to transform the WUPMP into a special case of the UNDP. The resulting problem has a polytope that is included in the UNDP polytope. Hence, the WUPMP is solvable by any algorithm that solves the UNDP (e.g. Holmberg & Hellstrand, 1998).Remark 2.2Reformulate (1) as proposed in Remark 2.1 for each maintenance activity i. Split each nodet∈{1,…,T}that represents a real period into two new nodes t′ and t′′ such that the ingoing (outgoing) arcs of t are the ingoing (outgoing) arcs of t′ (t′′). Insert a new arc (t′, t′′) with zero transportation cost, but with fixed costs ft. All other arcs have zero fixed costs and the variable transportation costs are equal to ci, t(i.e., the variable costs are unchanged compared to the original graph before the splitting of the node).In this section polyhedral attributes of the WUPMP that allow for conclusions concerning the resulting computational complexity are derived. In particular, we prove the results:•The polytope{xi,t∣∑τ=tt+πi−1xi,τ≥ai,t∀tand0≤xi,t≤bi,t∀t}of the generalized constraint (1) for a maintenance activity i comprises only integer extreme points (see Theorem 3.5).The WUPMP has the single-assignment property (see Lemma 3.8).The polytope of the presented WUPMP formulation is quasi-integral (see Theorem 3.13).In what follows, we briefly introduce some basic results of polyhedral theory that are needed later.Valid inequalities and faces: An inequality π · x ≤ π0 is a valid inequality of a polytope S if it is fulfilled by all elements x ∈ S. If the faceF={x∣x∈S∧π·x=π0}of S is non-empty, we say that the hyperplane{x∣π·x=π0}with the valid inequality π · x ≤ π0 supports S. If it holds thatF={x}for some x ∈ S the element x is denoted as a vertex or an extreme point of S. An integral face F contains only integral vertices (Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988, pp. 88–93; 536–537).Quasi-integrality: Let S be a polytope and let SI⊆S be the set of integer points in this polytope. A polytope S is denoted as quasi-integral if every edge of the convex hull of SIis also an edge of S (Yemelichev, Kovalev, and Kravtsov, 1984, pp. 189–191). This property allows for the development of effective integral simplex algorithms (e.g. Zaghrouti, Soumis, & El Hallaoui, 2014).Lemma 3.1Assume SI belongs to the set of vertices of a polytope S. Then, if for every pair of two integer points x1, x2of S there exists an integral face containing x1and x2, then S is quasi-integral.Polyhedral-integrality: We briefly describe two criteria that prove that all extreme points of a polyhedron are integer. A matrix A is denoted as totally unimodular (TU) if and only if every square submatrix of A has a determinant of−1,0 or 1. This can be verified by the following sufficient criterion (Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988, pp. 540–544).Lemma 3.2Let A be a{−1,0,1}matrix with at most two non-zero elements in each column (row). Then A is TU if and only if there exists a partition of the rows (columns) into two subsets A1and A2such that if a column (row) has two non-zero elements these are either in different subsets if they have the same sign or in the same subset if they have different signs.The polyhedron{x∈Rn|b′≤A·x≤b∧d′≤x≤d},with b′,b∈Zm; d′,d∈Znis integral, if A is TU and the polyhedron is non-empty.A system of linear inequalities A · x ≤ b is totally dual integral (TDI), if for allc∈Znwithmax{cT·x|A·x≤b∧x∈Rn}being finite, the optimal solution μ of the corresponding dual problemmin{bT·μ|AT·μ=c∧μ∈R+m}is integer (Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988, pp. 536–537).Lemma 3.4The polytope{x∈Rn|A·x≤b}is integral, if A · x ≤ b is TDI andb∈Zm.In what follows, we derive the polyhedral findings of this paper. The following Theorem 3.5 provides us with a significant attribute of the polyhedral structure of the generalized constraint (1) for a given maintenance activity i. Therefore, the LP relaxation of the WUPMP withN=1and the corresponding dual problem withci,t∈N0∀thave integral polytopes. The latter results from Corollary 3.7.Theorem 3.5Conv(S)=Pholds for the ith system of linear inequalities(7)∑τ=tt+πi−1xi,τ≥ai,t∀t=1,…,T−πi+1(8)0≤xi,t≤bi,t∀t=1,…,TwithS={x∣(7)(8)}∩N0T,P={x∣(7)(8)},ai,t∈Z∀t,andbi,t∈N0∀t.‘⇒’:Conv(S)⊆Pis trivial since P is convex.‘⇐’: In order to showConv(S)⊇P,we assume that there exists a feasible solutionx¯∈Pwith at least one fractional component0<x¯i,t<1. Clearly, ifx¯i,tdoes not exist we havex¯∈Conv(S). We prove that there exists a convex combination of K integer solutions that yieldsx¯. It follows thatx¯cannot be an extreme point and therefore,x¯∈Conv(S).Let K be the least common denominator from all non-zeros inx¯i,1,…,x¯i,Tthat are represented as fractions, which is computable in polynomial time with Euclid’s algorithm (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, 2001, pp. 856–862) with Wolfart (2011, pp. 3–4). A least common denominator always exists because (7) and (8) are rational linear inequalities (Schrijver, 1998, pp. 31–32). We denoteα=1Kas a quant.We construct K integer solutions xkwithxk∈N0Tfor allk=1,…,Kaccording to the following procedure (see also Example 3.6): Letxtk=0∀t=1,…,T;k=1,…,K. Setk=1,t=0andd=0. In every iteration, repeat the following steps: While d > 0, setxtk=xtk+1,d=d−αand setk=k+1if k < K (otherwise,k=1). Ifd=0,go to the next periodt=t+1and setd=x¯i,t. Commence the next iteration until it holds that t > T.Since the assignment of Q quants in the periodst1,t1+1,…,t2withQ∈Nover the K solutions is circular and K is a denominator of all non-zeros inx¯i,1,…,x¯i,T,⌊Q/K⌋≤∑τ=t1t2xτk≤⌈Q/K⌉holds for all i. If at leastQ=q·Kquants are assigned in the periodst1,t1+1,…,t2,we know that:(9)∑τ=t1t2xτk≥q∀k=1,…,K.Clearly, if at mostQ=q·Kquants are assigned in the periodst1,t1+1,…,t2,we conclude that:(10)∑τ=t1t2xτk≤q∀k=1,…,K.‘(7)’:⌊∑τ=tt+πi−1x¯i,τ⌋≥ai,tholds becausex¯is feasible andai,t∈N0. Hence, at least⌊∑τ=tt+πi−1x¯i,τ⌋·Kquants are assigned in the periodst,t+1,…,t+πi−1. Because of (9) witht1=tandt2=t+πi−1,it follows that∑τ=tt+πi−1xτk≥⌊∑τ=tt+πi−1x¯i,τ⌋≥ai,t∀t;k.‘(8)’:⌈x¯i,t⌉≤bi,tholds becausex¯is feasible andbi,t∈N0. Hence, at most⌈x¯i,t⌉·Kquants are assigned per period t. By applying (10) witht1=t2,it follows thatxtk≤⌈x¯i,t⌉≤bi,t∀t;k.Consequently, we obtain K feasible integer solutionsxk∈Conv(S)∀k. Moreover, it holds that(11)x¯=∑k=1Kα·xkis a strict convex combination since α > 0 andK·α=1. Hence,x¯∈Conv(S)holds.□LetT=10,πi=5,ai,t=1∀tandbi,t=1∀tfor activity i. Hence, (7) and (8) coincide with (1) and (6). Table 2shows the generation of K integer solutions xkfrom a given fractional solutionx¯. It followsK=4andα=0.25. The convex combination (11) yieldsx¯.The corresponding dual of the problem defined in Theorem 3.5 has an integral polyhedron as well.Corollary 3.7Conv(S)=Pholds for the ith system of linear inequalities of(12)max∑t=1T−πi+1ai,t·υi,t−∑t=1Tbi,t·αi,tsubjectto(13)∑τ=max{1,t−πi+1}min{t,T−πi+1}υi,τ−αi,t≤ci,t∀t=1,…,T(14)υi,t,αi,t≥0∀t=1,…,TwithS={(υ,α)∣(13)}∩N02·T,P={(υ,α)∣(13)(14)},ai,t,ci,t∈Z∀t,andbi,t∈N0∀tare finite.The polytope is bounded and non-empty. Hence, for all values of the integers ai, tand bi, t, the optimal objective function value of (12) is finite and the corresponding dual problemmin∑t=1Tci,t·xi,tsubjectto(7),(8)andxi,t≥0∀t=1,…,Thas an optimal integer solution. This results from Theorem 3.5. It remains true if slack variables are added to the dual problem. Hence, the system of inequalities (13) and (14) is TDI. Since it holds thatci,t∈Z∀t,the polyhedron is integral by Lemma 3.4.□In what follows, we show that the WUPMP has the so-called single-assignment property as also known from the UFLP and the UNDP (Holmberg & Hellstrand, 1998; Krarup & Pruzan, 1983). Its main consequence is as follows: if y is binary, then x is implicitly binary as well.Lemma 3.8The single-assignment propertyConv(S)=Conv(T)withS={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(3)(4)}andT={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(4)(6)}holds.‘ ⇒’:Conv(S)⊆Conv(T)obviously holds.‘⇐’: ConsiderConv(S)⊇Conv(T). Let(x,y)∈Conv(T)be a feasible solution. Since y ∈ {0, 1}Tis given, the right-hand side of (2) is not zero anymore, but y. By applying Theorem 3.5 withai,t=1∀i;tandbi,t=yt∀i;t,we conclude thatConv(U)=PwithU={x∣(1)(3)}andP={x∣(1)(6)}holds. Hence, it follows(x,y)∈Conv(S).□Preliminary computational tests show that many optimal solutions(x¯,y¯)of the LP relaxation of the WUPMP, which are extreme points, have integer components. The single-assignment property of Lemma 3.8 allows us to focus on the determination of the variablesy¯.Observation 3.9 is of particular importance since the polytope {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)} has fractional extreme points. Example 3.10 illustrates such an instance. Due to the later polyhedral findings of Lemmas 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5, we neither can reduce N, T nor change π without losing the fractional extreme points. Hence, the instance has minimal dimensions.Example 3.10LetN=2,T=3,π=(2,3)T,f=(12,1,12)T,andc=(1211212112). The fractional optimal solutionx=(12121212012)andyt=12∀tas well as the integer solutionx=(101100)andy=(1,0,1)are extreme points of {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)} with an objective function value 2.5.The following Remark 3.11 allows for an explanation of the aforementioned Observation 3.9. Note that an analogous observation is made for the UFLP as well as for the UNDP (Holmberg & Hellstrand, 1998; Krarup & Pruzan, 1983).Remark 3.11All vertices ofConv(S)withS={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(3)(4)}are integer solutions and vertices ofP={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(5)}because P is contained in the {0, 1}-hypercube of (3) and (4).Quasi-integrality is a property, which is tighter than Remark 3.11. In what follows, we prove quasi-integrality of the polytope {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)} that is also known for the polytopes of the UFLP and the UNDP (Yemelichev et al., 1984, pp. 192–193); (Hellstrand, Larsson, & Migdalas, 1992). For this purpose, we transform the WUPMP into an extended UFLP. In this reformulation, the Restriction (1) is disaggregated such that there are altogetherJ=N·Tperiods, namely T periodsIi={(i−1)·T+1,…,i·T}for each maintenance activityi∈{1,…,N}. Furthermore, each period j ∈ Iiof a maintenance activity has to be covered by a real periodt∈{0,1,…,T}. Specifically, we have to decide for each of the T periods of the set Iiwhether the considered real period t is used for maintenance or whether this period is covered by a maintenance activity that is conducted in an earlier period. This decision is indicated by the binary variable zj, t(1 ≤ j ≤ J; 0 ≤ t ≤ T) that is equal to one if and only if the period(j−1modT)+1of the maintenance activity i is covered by an execution in the real period t. Otherwise, zj, tis set to zero. In order to generate feasible schedules, the coverage πiof activity i determines the resulting assignment costs hj, t. The assignment costs hj, treflect the stairway structure of Restriction (1). Specifically, it holds thathj,t=0if the period(j−1modT)+1in the planning horizon of activityi=⌈jT⌉is covered by the real period t, i.e., if j ∈ Iiandt∈{j−(i−1)·T−πi+1,…,j−(i−1)·T}. Otherwise, the assignment is infeasible and we definehj,t=∞. All other parameters and variables are identical to the WUPMP. Therefore, we obtain the following reformulated optimization problem:(15)min∑t=1Tft·yt+∑i=1N∑t=1Tci,t·xi,t+∑j=1J∑t=0Thj,t·zj,tsubjectto(16)∑t=0Tzj,t=1∀j=1,…,J(17)zj,t≤xi,t∧xi,t≤yt∀i=1,…,N;j∈Ii;t=1,…,T(18)0≤xi,t,yt,zj,t≤1∀i=1,…,N;j=1,…,J;t=0,…,T(19)xi,t,yt,zj,t∈{0,1}∀i=1,…,N;j=1,…,J;t=0,…,TAnalogously to the original problem, the objective function (15) pursues the minimization of the total costs. In a feasible solution of the reformulated model each planning period of a maintenance activity has to be covered by exactly one real period due to Restriction (16). This is done at zero cost only if the time distance of the chosen real period is not above the coverage of the respective activity. The connection between the newly introduced z-variables and the x-variables is provided by Restrictions (16) and (17) covering Restriction (2). The LP relaxation is defined by Restriction (18). The variable domains (19) are integral. It is obvious that a feasible solution (x, y) of the reformulated problem with a finite objective function value corresponds to a feasible solution of the WUPMP and vice versa (see Example 3.12). Specifically, it holds that:•To every integer (fractional) point in {(x, y, z)∣(16)–(18)} there exists one integer (one fractional) point in {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)}.To every integer (fractional) point in {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)} exists one integer (one fractional) point in {(x, y)∣(16)–(18)} and at least one integer (at least one fractional) point in {(x, y, z)∣(16)–(18)}.LetN=1,T=5andπ1=3. Table 3shows the assignment costs and a feasible solution to the reformulated WUPMP (16)–(19). If an entry (j, t) is given in italic, we havezj,t=1(otherwise, it holds thatzj,t=0). Hence, we obtainx1,3=x1,5=1withy3=y5=1from Fig. 1.The polytope {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)} is quasi-integral.First, we prove quasi-integrality forP={(x,y,z)∣(16)--(18)}. For this purpose, we apply Lemma 3.1. Subsequently, we show quasi-integrality for the WUPMP. Since a similar property presented in Remark 3.11 applies to P and the convex hull, we have to show that any two integral verticess1=(x1,y1,z1)ands2=(x2,y2,z2)with s1, s2 ∈ P belong to an integral face. For this purpose, we defined=N·T+T+J·(T+1)and introduce three disjoint index sets:L0={l∈Nd∣sl1=0∧sl2=0}∧L1={l∈N0d|sl1=1∧sl2=1}∧LF={l∈N0d|sl1≠sl2}.The hyperplanes{s∣s=(x,y,z)∧sl=0∀l∈L0}and{s∣s=(x,y,z)∧sl=1∀l∈L1}obviously support the polytope P and a face of this polytope isF={s∈P|sl=0∀l∈L0∧sl=1∀l∈L1}.In what follows, we prove the integrality of F by the attribute of total unimodularity. Let A be the coefficient matrix of (16)–(18) without slack variables that contains only the columns from LF. Hence, compared to the coefficient matrix of the original problem (16)–(18), all columns that correspond to variables withsl1=sl2are removed. Clearly, all entries of A are either 0, 1, or −1. We consider Restriction (16) and ask for the number of non-zero entries in the corresponding J rows of matrix A. Since s1 and s2 are feasible integer solutions, for both solutions we have a pair of indicest1,t2∈{0,1,…,T}withzj,t11=zj,t22=1. If it holds thatt1=t2,we concludezj,t1=zj,t2for allt∈{0,1,…,T}. Therefore, the corresponding row is a zero row since the columns that belong to the equal variables do not belong to A. If, however, it holds thatt1≠t2there are exactly two unequal variables withzj,t11=1−zj,t12=1andzj,t22=1−zj,t21=1. Consequently, we obtain two “+1”-entries in the corresponding row of matrix A. The first part of Restriction (17) has the formzj,t−xi,t≤0in A and possesses two non-zero elements only if it holds thatzj,t1=1−zj,t2andxi,t1=1−xi,t2for the considered indext∈{0,1,…,T}. Then, we have one “+1”-entry and one “–1”-entry. Moreover, one of the following three other cases may apply: If it holds thatzj,t1=zj,t2andxi,t1=1−xi,t2,then one “–1”-entry is obtained. If it holds thatzj,t1=1−zj,t2andxi,t1=xi,t2we obtain one “+1”-entry. Finally, if it holds thatzj,t1=zj,t2andxi,t1=xi,t2,we have a zero row. The same arguments hold for the second part of Restriction (17) that has the formxi,t−yt≤0in A. Restriction (18) has either zero rows or rows with one “+1”-entry.Altogether, we state that A has at most two non-zeros in each row. Assign all columns l ∈ LFwithsl1=1,sl2=0to A1 and all columns withsl1=0,sl2=1to A2. All other columns do not belong to A since the variables of the two integer solutions are identical. Due to this assignment, the two “+1”-values that may occur in rows resulting from Restriction (16) are assigned to different sets of columns. This results from the fact that each “+1”-value results from another of the two solutions. Moreover, the “+1” and “–1” that may simultaneously occur in a row of Restriction (17) either result completely from the integer solution s1 or from the integer solution s2. Therefore, they are assigned to the same set of columns. Thus, the matrix A is TU (Lemma 3.2), F is an integral face (Lemma 3.3) and we obtain that P is quasi-integral (Lemma 3.1).Finally, we consider the WUPMP. Since Remark 3.11 holds, we construct a face F′ as presented for P for two integral vertices ofP′={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(5)}. Assume that F′ is not an integral face because there exists a vertexs′=(x¯,y¯)with s′ ∈ F′ that has at least one fractional component0<x¯i,t<1or0<y¯t<1. Since the vertices are feasible and objective function values are finite, there exists a corresponding fractional vertexs=(x,y,z)in F. This contradicts that F is an integral face. Thus, F′ is an integral face and P′ is quasi-integral (Lemma 3.1).□As summarized in Table 4, this section analyzes the complexity of different variants of the WUPMP.While for different special cases polynomial exact solution approaches are developed, the general case is stronglyNP-hard. This results from the following lemma.Lemma 4.1The WUPMP is stronglyNP-hard even if it holds thatπi=T∀iandft=f1∀t.We prove the strongNP-hardness by a polynomial reduction from SET COVER, i.e., by showing SET COVER ≤pWUPMPπi=T∧ft=f1. SET COVER is known to be stronglyNP-complete and is briefly defined as follows (Garey and Johnson, 1979, p. 222): an instance ISCof SET COVER comprises S elements, P setsC1,…,CPwithCt⊆{1,…,S}∀t∈{1,…,P},and a positive integer K with K ≤ P. ISCis solvable if and only if there exists an index set A withA⊆{1,…,P}and |A| ≤ K such that⋃t∈ACt={1,…,S}.We generate the following instance IWUPMPof the WUPMP with the parameter settingN=S,T=P,πi=T∀i,ft=1∀t. Moreover, we defineci,t=0if i ∈ Ctapplies (otherwise,ci,t=K+1) ∀i; t. The instance IWUPMPis denoted as solvable if there exists a feasible maintenance schedule with total costs smaller or equal to K. This transformation is done in polynomial time.We prove the equivalence of both problem instances, i.e., ISCsolvable ⇔ IWUPMPsolvable.‘⇒’: We assume that ISCis solvable. Therefore, there exists a set A with |A| ≤ K and⋃t∈ACt={1,…,S}. Then, a feasible solution of IWUPMPcan be defined as follows: letyt=1if t ∈ A (otherwise, 0) ∀t andxi,t=1if i ∈ Ct(otherwise, 0) ∀i; t. This maintenance schedule has total costs |A| ≤ K since variable costs are zero and |A| periods are chosen. Every activityi∈{1,…,S}is contained in at least one set Ctwith t ∈ A. Consequently, due toπi=T=Pthe schedule fulfills Restriction (1). A set Ctwith t ∈ A either contains the ith element or not, which satisfies (2). Thus, (x, y) is feasible to IWUPMPwith an objective value smaller or equal to K.‘⇐’: We assume that IWUPMPis solvable. Hence, there exists a feasible solution (x, y) to IWUPMPwith total costs smaller or equal to K. We construct a corresponding feasible solution to ISCby definingA={t=1,…,T|yt=1}. Then, it holds that|A|=∑t=1Tyt≤Ksince, by assumption, the total fixed costs of the maintenance schedule are upper bounded by K. We show that this solution is feasible for ISC. For this purpose, we assume that there exists an element i withi∉⋃t∈ACt. Since (x, y) is feasible for IWUPMP, due to (1), there exists a periodt∈{1,…,T}where it holds thatxi,t=1andyt=1. Consequently, we have t ∈ A andi∉⋃t∈ACtimplies ci, t> K. This contradicts that (x, y) causes costs not larger than K. Therefore, i does not exist and we conclude that A provides a feasible solution of ISC.□However, Lemma 4.1 does not rule out the existence of polynomial special cases of the WUPMP.Lemma 4.2IfN=1,the WUPMP is polynomially solvable in time O(T · log T) and it holds thatConv(S)=PwithS={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(3)(4)}andP={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(5)}.Due toN=1,Restriction (1) deals with a single maintenance activity and we seti=1. Therefore, by making use of Remark 2.1, we transform the simplified WUPMP into a Shortest Path Problem in the graph G(V, E1). An arc (t, τ) ∈ E1 obtains the weightwt,τ=fτ+c1,τ. Since G(V, E1) is cycle-free, we apply a slightly modified version of the well-known reaching algorithm proposed by Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin (1993, pp. 107–108) in order to find the shortest path from the initial node 0 to a node t ∈ V witht+π1>T. Our implementation uses a min-heap (Cormen et al., 2001, pp. 127–135) as a main data structure that temporarily stores for each period index t at most one entry with minimal length SP(t) (i.e., with minimal costs). The algorithm starts with the initial entry(0,SP(0)=0),while in each step the entry t with a minimal SP(t)-value is selected. If it holds thatt+π1>Ta shortest path in the graph is found. If it holds thatt+π1≤T,all indices of still unvisited periods τ ∈ V witht<τ≤t+π1are inserted into the heap with a cost valueSP(τ)=SP(t)+wt,τ=SP(t)+fτ+c1,τ. Note that, due to the fact that the length of each arc is independent of its starting node, each index of a period is inserted into the heap only once. Therefore, a later reduction of its length is not possible. Hence, the algorithm works in at most O(T) iterations while all necessary upheap operations can be performed in time O(log T). Thus, the WUPMP withN=1is solvable in time O(T · log T).‘⇒’:Conv(S)⊆Pis trivial since P is convex.‘⇐’: In order to proveConv(S)⊇P,we assume that there exists a vertex(x¯,y¯)∈Pwith at least one fractional component. Due toN=1,ytbecomes redundant and we obtainy¯t∈{0,1}for each vertex(x¯,y¯)∈PwithN=1. However, assuming0<x¯1,t<1would lead to a contradiction to the proposition of Theorem 3.5 witha1,t=1∀tandb1,t=1∀t. Therefore, the vertex(x¯,y¯)∈Pis integral. Consequently, each feasible solution in P can be defined as a convex combination of vertices ofConv(S). Hence, we obtainConv(S)⊇P.□The WUPMP is optimally solvable in timeO(min{N·TN+1·2N,N·T·logT·2T}). IfN=k∈O(1)or if T ∈ O(1), the WUPMP is polynomially solvable in timeO(Tk+1)or in time O(N), respectively. Furthermore, there exists an optimal integral vertex in {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)}.In order to solve the WUPMP to optimality, we introduce two alternative algorithms.The first algorithm is a Dynamic Programming approach (DP). Its computation transforms the WUPMP into a Shortest Path Problem. This path has to be found in a weighted, directed graph G(V, E) that possesses the following set of nodes V: Each node is an encoding of a partial solution(t,α1,…,αN),with 1 ≤ αi≤ πiwithi∈{1,…,N}andt∈{1,…,T}. Each entry αidefines the remaining coverage of activity i measured in periods at time period t. Specifically, for activity iαi=πi+τ−tdetermines at time t (and t is counted) the number of periods that are covered by a preceding maintenance activity in a period τ. For each node of the graph the functionF(t,α1,…,αN)provides the minimal total maintenance cost for attaining this constellation. Moreover, we additionally introduce an initial source node(0,α1init=π1,…,αNinit=πN)with zero costsF(0,α1init,…,αNinit)=0and a final sink node(T+1,α1final=0,…,αNfinal=0). Since it holds that πi≤ T ∀i, there are at most TNnodes per layert∈{1,…,T}. Hence, we asymptotically bound the number of nodes in the graph |V| from above byO(T·TN)=O(TN+1). To each node (or partial solution)(t,α1,…,αN)in a layert∈{0,…,T−1},we define a set of successorsSsucc(t,α1,…,αN)that represent valid succeeding solutions in the subsequent layert+1. Specifically, it holds thatSsucc(t,α1,…,αN)={(t+1,β1,…,βN)∣0≤t≤T−1∧βi∈{πi,αi−1}∀i∧βi≥1∀i}. Feasibility according to (1) is ensured by the restrictions βi≥ 1 ∀i because every period1,…,t+1is covered. An execution of the maintenance activity i has been conducted in periodt+1if it holds thatβi=πifor the resulting partial solution(t+1,β1,…,βN). Therefore, we define a corresponding maintenance vectorM(t+1,β)=(m1t+1(β),…,mNt+1(β)),with the binary componentsmit+1(β)=1ifβi=πiand, otherwise, 0 for all i. The weight of this arc is determined by the resulting total maintenance cost in periodt+1. It amounts toC(t+1,β)=maxi=1,…,Nmit+1(β)·ft+1+∑i=1Nmit+1(β)·ci,t+1. Moreover, each node(T,α1,…,αN)in the layer T defines a complete solution and is connected by an arc with zero weight to the final sink node. Aside from the initial source node and the final sink node, the resulting graph has T layers with at most TNnodes each. In this graph, each node in a layert∈{0,…,T−1}has at most(kN)successors in layert+1with k maintenance activities that are conducted in periodt+1. Therefore, the number of successors for the layers0,…,T−1is upper bounded by∑k=0N(kN)=2N. Hence, the number of arcs |E| in the graph G(V, E) is asymptotically bounded from above byO(|V|·2N)=O(TN+1·2N). The complete graph can be generated in timeO(TN+1·2N·N). In order to reduce the size of the graph, the following dominance criterion is applied. A partial solution(t,α1,…,αN)with costs Ctotal(t, α) that is visited during the searching process is deleted if there is a different partial solution(t,β1,…,βN)fulfilling∀i∈{1,…,N}:αi≤βiand Ctotal(t, α) ≥ Ctotal(t, β). A shortest path from the initial source node to the final sink node provides an optimal maintenance schedule and is calculated in timeO(|V|+|E|). Note that this holds because the graph G(V, E) is cycle-free (Ahuja et al., 1993, pp. 107–108). Based on the shortest path, a corresponding optimal integer solution (x, y) is obtained in time O(N · T). Thus, the WUPMP is solved in timeO(TN+1·2N·N)+O(|V|+|E|)+O(N·T)=O(TN+1·N·2N).The second algorithm is denoted as an Iterative Shortest Path procedure (ISP). In order to find an optimal schedule, it iteratively enumerates all feasible y-vectors. After fixing these periods by a currently considered y-vector, N independent subproblems arise that can be solved to optimality in time O(T · log T) to yield values for x. This is done by applying the shortest path procedure introduced in Lemma 4.2. Hence, integer values of x are obtained in time O(N · T · log T). The number of feasible binary vectors y is asymptotically bounded by O(2T). Due to the maintenance restrictions, binary vectors withπmin=min{πi∣1≤i≤N}=π1or more consecutive zeros are discarded. The running time of ISP is asymptotically upper bounded by O(N · T · log T · 2T).By alternatively applying one of both algorithms, the WUPMP is solvable in timeO(min{N·TN+1·2N,N·T·logT·2T}). Thus, if it holds thatN=k∈O(1)or if T ∈ O(1) applies, we obtain a polynomial running time ofO(Tk+1)or of O(N). Furthermore, Remark 3.11 applies to (x, y).□In order to evaluate the practicability, both algorithms that are proposed in Lemma 4.3 were programmed in C++ and applied to numerous instances. These instances were randomly generated according to a basic setting that was derived from a specific practical application of the WUPMP. In this application, a maintenance schedule for an oil platform has to be generated for the next T weeks. For this purpose, various maintenance activities have to be performed in predetermined time intervals (the coverages π) in order to guarantee safety and quality restrictions. Depending on the scheduled maintenance activities, different teams of engineers are flown to the platform. The flight costs depend on the week the flight is actually booked, but they are independent of the transported teams. Hence, they are considered fixed costs. In contrast to this, the variable costs may differ considerably with the needed resources and their availability at a requested period.All computational tests were conducted on an Intel Core i7-4790K CPU (4.00 gigahertz) that is equipped with 32 gigabytes working memory. All in all, we applied both algorithms to 180 randomly generated instances that are clustered in 18 problem groups. Hence, each group comprised 10 instances that have a predetermined number of planning periods T and number of maintenance activities N. By drawing π-values uniformly between 0.1 · T and 0.3 · T each maintenance activity has to be performed five times in the average, while a significant difference between the generated π-values ensures a considerable complexity. Fixed costs are randomly chosen out of the uniform interval [200, 50] and the variable costs are randomly drawn out of the interval [40, 10]. Therefore, maintenance activities with different cost structure characteristics are obtained due to a high variability of the resulting ratios of variable and fixed costs.The measured results that are depicted in Table 5underscore the derived asymptotic running times of the algorithms proposed by Lemma 4.3. However, while, as expected, the number of considered periods T significantly increases the running time of the ISP-approach, an increase of the number of maintenance activities N may slightly reduce its complexity. Both effects can be ascribed to the fact that the number of enumerated y-vectors clearly dominates the running time of the procedure. While this number increases exponentially with T, a larger number of maintenance activities N tends to reduce the minimum of coverages πmin , which in turn may substantially decrease the number of feasible y-vectors. Note that this reduction (that is not considered in the running time function) may slightly dominate the linearly increasing effort of solving a larger number of shortest path problems.In contrast to this, the complexity of the DP-algorithm increases with larger values of both parameters. However, as defined by the running time function, the exponential impact of N significantly dominates. Therefore, instances with more than 10 maintenance activities cannot be solved by the DP-approach to optimality in reasonable time. In these cases, the DP-approach is outperformed by the ISP-procedure. The exponential complexity of the DP-approach can be also observed by analyzing the listed number of generated nodes that is significantly reduced by applying the proposed dominance rule.In what follows, we consider further special cases that are polynomial.Lemma 4.4IfN=2andπi=T∀i,thenConv(S)=PwithS={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(3)(4)}andP={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(5)}holds.Let A be the coefficient matrix of (1) and (2) as shown in Table 6on the left. Clearly, A is a{−1,0,1}matrix with at most two non-zero elements in each column. We assign the rows to the two sets A1 and A2 as indicated by an asterisk. We conclude that the matrix A is TU (Lemma 3.2) and that the polytope is integral (Lemma 3.3).□It is worth mentioning that, although the result of Lemma 4.4 allows the application of a variant of Tardos’ algorithm (Vavasis & Ye, 1996) in order to solve the WUPMP withN=2to optimality, a reduced worst case running time of O(T3) is attained by the approach proposed in Lemma 4.3. A comparable polyhedral constellation arises in the following Lemma:Lemma 4.5Ifπi=2∀i,the WUPMP is polynomially solvable in time O(N3.5 · T3.5 · L) with L as the input length of N and T in bits. Furthermore,Conv(S)=PwithS={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(3)(4)}andP={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(5)}holds.Table 6 on the right shows the coefficient matrix of (1) and (2) for maintenance activity i. In order to show the polyhedral result, our proof is analogous to Lemma 4.4. The number of variables of the LP relaxation is asymptotically bounded from above by O(N · T). Thus, the LP relaxation is solvable in time O(N3.5 · T3.5 · L) by a variant of Tardos’ algorithm (Vavasis & Ye, 1996).□Ifft=0∀t,the WUPMP is polynomially solvable in time O(N · T · log T) and there exists an optimal integral vertex in {(x, y)∣(1)(2)(5)}.Sinceft=0∀tholds, Restriction (2) is neglected because it is redundant. Consequently, we obtain N independent subproblems and each subproblem is solved to optimality in time O(T · log T) (Lemma 4.2). Hence, x is generated in total time O(N · T · log T). The y-values are defined byyt=maxi=1,…,Nxi,t∀tin time O(N · T). All in all, an optimal integer solution (x, y) is computed in timeO(N·T·logT)+O(N·T)=O(N·T·logT). Furthermore, Remark 3.11 applies to (x, y).□Ifci,t=0∀i;t,the WUPMP is polynomially solvable in timeO(N·T+T·logT)and there exists an optimal integral vertex inP={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(5)}. By introducing(20)xi,t=yt∀i=1,…,N;t=1,…,T,it holds thatConv(S)=TwithS={(x,y)∣(1)(3)(4)(20)}andT={(x,y)∣(1)(5)(20)}. Consequently, all vertices ofConv(S)are vertices of P.Since it holds thatci,t=0∀i;t,the x-variables are no longer relevant. Hence, there exists an optimal solution of the WUPMP that fulfills the new Restriction (20). Since the fixed costs are relevant only, we solve the WUPMP for activityi=1withN=1in time O(T · log T) (Lemma 4.2) and obtain values for y. Considering Restriction (20), setxi,t=yt∀i;tand obtain a feasible solution in time O(N · T). The optimality of the solution results from the fact that the total costs are identical with the costs of the optimal solution to the WUPMP withN=1that provide a lower bound value. Consequently, an optimal integer solution (x, y) is obtained in total timeO(T·logT)+O(N·T)=O(N·T+T·logT). Remark 3.11 applies to (x, y).Since Restriction (20) allows the substitution of x-variables by y-variables in Restriction (1),Conv(S)=Tfollows directly from Theorem 3.5 withai,t=1∀tandbi,t=1∀t. Moreover, we know that(x,y)∈Conv(S)implies(x,y)∈Conv(U)withU={(x,y)∣(1)(2)(3)(4)}. Thus, a vertex ofConv(S)is a vertex ofConv(U). Hence, due to Remark 3.11, (x, y) is a vertex of P.□The polynomial time complexities without fixed costs (ft=0∀t) and without variable costs (ci,t=0∀i;t) are also derived by Theorem 3.5 and, therefore, from a polyhedral point of view.
