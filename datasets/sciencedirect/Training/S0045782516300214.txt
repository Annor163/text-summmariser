@&#ABSTRACT@&#
While the interest in higher-order models in physics and mechanics grows, their numerical simulation still poses a challenge, especially for arbitrary shaped three-dimensional domains. This contribution presents the mathematical framework as well as the application to different problems in the field of material science, fracture mechanics and diffusion problems. All models under consideration require at leastC1continuity, which prevents the application of standard finite element analysis and local mesh refinements.Introducing isogeometric analysis (IGA) for the discretization in a finite element framework enables us to deal with these requirements. Moreover, a general hierarchical refinement scheme based on a subdivision projection is presented here for one, two and three dimensional simulations. This technique allows to enhance the approximation space using finer splines on each level but preserves the partition of unity as well as the continuity properties of the original discretization.Using this mathematical framework, the improved convergence of a Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model, a mesh-adapted thermal diffusion simulation and computations of a priori unknown crack propagation in different fracture modes underline the versatility of the presented hierarchical refinement scheme.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Phase-field models have gained raising attention for numerical simulations of a broad range of physical phenomena throughout the past years. In combination with finite element based solution strategies they enable a fascinating variety of multi-field and multi-physics simulations, cf.  [1–5] and many others. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the presented mathematical framework an in-depth investigation of a series of higher-order problems is presented.We start with a Kuramoto–Sivashinsky system, cf.  [6,7,3]. The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model has been derived for the simulation of different thermodynamical systems far away from equilibrium state, e.g., fluctuations in fluid films and instabilities in laminar flame fronts, see, Paniconi and Elder  [3], among many others. This transient fourth-order evolution equation accounts for the physics of arising chaotic instabilities in the spatial as well as the temporal domain and allows us to investigate the consistency as well as the convergence of local refinement schemes in one and two dimensions. The numerical solution of the fourth-order operator is traditionally realized using finite difference schemes. In the context of FEA for irreducible systems, globalC1continuity is required, see Gomez and Paris  [6] for the application of NURBS basis functions.To demonstrate the capabilities in three dimensions we study a higher-order phase-field approach to brittle fracture within a fully non-linear framework along with a structure-preserving time integration, cf.  [8,9]. Classical brittle fracture mechanics of Griffith and Irwin  [10,11] states that material fails locally upon the attainment of a specific fracture energy. Based on this theory phase-field methods provide a modern tool to numerically predict a priori unknown crack paths. This specific methodology relies on a variationally consistent formulation of an augmented multi-field energy functional, taking the fracture energy within an additional field equation into account. The approach has proven to be accurate and robust in two and three dimensions, see Miehe et al.  [12] among many others.Here, we propose a novel framework for general non-linear hyperelastic material models combined with a fourth-order phase-field model along with the hierarchical refinement scheme presented above. The approach for finite elasticity relies on a multiplicative decomposition of the local deformation field into a compressive and a tensile part, as proposed in Hesch and Weinberg  [13], i.e., we assume that local stress induces fracturing only for tension, once a certain critical energy has been reached. The applied fourth-order model for the phase-field has been proposed in Borden et al.  [8] to improve accuracy and convergence using the superior regularity of a higher-order phase-field.Eventually, a two and three dimensional model of temperature controlled diffusion in a polymer blend is investigated, cf.  [14]. In consequence of different chemical potentials of both substances diffusion will be triggered and the blend starts to decompose into two different phases. Here the order parameter of the phase field marks the mass concentrationcin the domain, with0≤c≤1. In analogy to the previously presented phase-field model of brittle fracture, the interface between coexisting phases is a transition region of small but finite length where the order parameter changes rapidly but smoothly.For the numerical calculations, we aim at a consistent discretization of the underlying partial differential equations in contrast to mixed approaches, which are computational inefficient due to the arising large number of unknowns. Here, we apply an isogeometric analysis (IGA) approach, which employs Non-Uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS) as finite element basis functions. NURBS basis functions allow to predefine the basis functions’ continuity within their construction, see Cottrell et al.  [15] for a comprehensive review. The underlying splines have local support but are not restricted to a single finite element; in the multivariate case they have a tensor product structure. These specific properties, however, turn into a major drawback for the construction of local refinement procedures which are necessary for large-scale, three-dimensional systems with locally sharp gradients or other local areas of interest.To solve these mesh-subdivision problems T-splines have been introduced in the IGA to break the tensor product structure of the spline base, see Bazilevs et al.  [16]. Because additional knots are inserted into the structure, the arising T-junctions can be considered as the IGA version of hanging nodes of standard FEA. As shown in Scott et al.  [17] such refinement algorithms improve the quality of approximation but become very complex in three-dimensional domains. Additionally, restriction on the polynomial degree, on the linear dependence of T-spline blending functions and on the locality of the refinement are known.An alternative to the element-based mesh-subdivision procedures provides the hierarchical superposition of shape functions. Such refinement methods are long known from high-order FEA, see, e.g. the work of Szabò and Babuška  [18], and for B-splines they have already been introduced by Forsey and Bartels  [19]. Recently, such refinements have been applied within the framework of IGA, see, e.g. Vuong et al.  [20], Evans et al.  [21] and Scott et al.  [22]. The basic idea behind a hierarchical refinement is simple: B-spline and NURBS basis functions are replaced on the refined level by a linear combination of scaled and copied versions of themselves, i.e. the refinement concept relies on a subdivision of the underlying NURBS functions. This procedure maintains the global properties in terms of smoothness and continuity of the unrefined mesh at the cost of a non-trivial implementation. Extensions to the multivariate case are possible. Although the general concept of hierarchical refinement is straightforward, in detail the realizations within the FEA differ. For the application to arbitrary shaped domains, we present a novel extension of the refinement scheme in order to preserve the partition of unity property in case of repeated knots.The outline of the paper is as follows: In Section  2, we recall the concept of isogeometric analysis and introduce the hierarchical refinement procedure in detail. In Section  3 the temporal discretization is outlined in a general way. Applications to demonstrate the capabilities of the refinement scheme are presented in Section  4. In particular, the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model is presented in Section  4.1, Section  4.2 addresses the higher-order phase-field model of fracture mechanics, and in Section  4.3 the thermophoresis is analyzed. A short summary in Section  5 concludes the paper.We start this section with a brief review on spline based finite element methodologies. Assuming the existence of a specific weak form defined in a domainBˆ, Galerkin type methods based on shape functions with global support have already been applied to simple geometries more then half a century ago. Subdividing the domainBˆinto a finite set of non-overlapping elementse∈E, such that(1)Bˆ≈Bˆh=⋃e∈EBˆe,as proposed by Courant  [23] and later on by Turner et al.  [24] allows for the use of shape functions with local support in each elementeand thus, for a simple approximative representation of complex geometries. Such finite element approximations found numerous applications in various disciplines, although it comes at the cost of reduced continuity across the element boundaries. About a decade ago T. Hughes  [25–27] introduced non-uniform rational B-splines as finite element basis functions with the aim to gain control on continuity requirements in design and to maintain the geometrical exact representation of complex engineering structures. He coined the term Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) which we will continue to use for all NURBS based finite element methods.A multivariate B-spline basis of degreep=[p1,…,pd]and dimensiond∈{1,2,3}is defined by the dyadic productΘ=Θ1⊗⋯⊗Θdof univariate knot vectors, built by a sequence of knotsΘl=[ξ1l≤ξ2l≤⋯≤ξn+pl+1l],l∈{1,…,d}. In the absence of repeated knots, the partition[ξi11,ξi1+11]×⋯×[ξidd,ξid+1d]form an element of the mesh in the parametric domain.11We define the number of repetitions inΘat nodeias multiplicitymi.A single multivariate B-splineBAis then defined by(2)BA=Bpi(ξ)=Bpi(ξ1,…,ξd)=∏l=1dNil,pl(ξl),with multi-indexi=[i1,…,id]andsupp(BA)=[ξi11,ξi1+p1+11]×⋯×[ξidd,ξid+pd+1d]. It provides the necessary support for the required continuity. The recursive definition of a univariate B-spline is given as follows(3)Nil,pl=ξ−ξillξil+pll−ξillNil,pl−1(ξ)+ξil+pl+1l−ξξil+pl+1l−ξil+1lNil+1,pl−1(ξ),starting with(4)Nil,0(ξ)={1ifξill≤ξ<ξil+1l0otherwise .The collection of B-splinesBA,A∈[1,…,n]is defined onΘand the corresponding spline space, defined asS(Θ)=span(BA). Moreover, the extension to the NURBS space is given by(5)RA=Rpi(ξ)=∏l=1dNil,pl(ξl)wi∑iˆ∏l=1dNiˆl,pl(ξl)wiˆ,along with the corresponding NURBS weightswi.The fundamental properties of a basis used for finite element analysis (FEA) are well known to be:•Linear independence,∑AcARA(ξ)≡0⇔cA=0.Partition of unity,∑ARA(ξ)=1.Local support of B-splines and of NURBSSmoothness is related to knot multiplicitymiNonnegativity, i.e.RA(ξ)≥0.Standard refinement strategies subdivide on the existing mesh which is in contradiction to the tensor product structure of B-splines. In contrast, hierarchical refinement schemes superpose additional degrees of freedom on the original basis function. A B-spline basis function defined on the hierarchical levelkcan be replaced by a linear combination of splines on the next levelk+1via(6)Bk,A=Bpk,i(ξ)=∑j=0p+1∏l=1d2−pl(pl+1jl)Nil,pl(2ξl−jlhl−ξill),wherehlrefers to the coarse level element length in the parameter space and1=[1,…,1]∈Rd. This procedure subdivides a B-spline in(p1+2)⋅…⋅(pd+2)scaled and contracted copies of itself, see Figs. 1 and 2for graphical representations in 1D and 2D. As shown, the parametric domain itself is subdivided into half steps to provide sufficient positions for the splines on the next levelk+1. Obviously, this refines the mesh locally with respect to the support of the B-spline at levelk. To rewrite this approach in a more convenient way, we introduce a subdivision matrixSproviding the scaling information in (6) and obtain(7)Bpk,i(ξ)=∑j=0p+1Si,jBpk+1,2i−1+j(ξ).Once the subdivision matrix for a single B-spline is constructed, assembly operations analogous to standard FE assembly operations can be conducted to obtain a global, rectangular banded and sparse subdivision matrix. The multi-indicesiandj, which denote the position in the parametric domain, i.e., within the tensor product structure, along with the local support of the B-spline provides sufficient information for the assembly. Following the extension for NURBS outlined in (5), we obtain(8)Rk,A=Rpk,i(ξ)=∑j=0p+1Si,jBpk+1,2i−1+j(ξ)w2i−1+j∑iˆ∑j=0p+1Siˆ,jBpk+1,2iˆ−1+j(ξ)w2iˆ−1+jfor a refined NURBS basis. Note that (6) is only valid for uniform knot vectors and has to be modified for non-uniform knot vectors as often used in (8), see Sabin  [28].The situation renders more complex in the present of repeated knots,mi>1. Although written in a most common way, we consider here only repeated knots at the boundary of a domain. Using the recursive definition (3) and the fact that ford=p=1,m1=mn+p+1=2and an arbitrary levelk≥0the relations(9)N1,1k(ξ)=N1,1k+1(ξ)+12N2,1k+1(ξ),∀ξ∈R,(10)N1,nk(ξ)=12Nn−1,1k+1(ξ)+Nn,1k+1(ξ),∀ξ∈R,hold, we obtain modified subdivision matrices for the basis functions which are affected by multiplicities as follows. LetΘ=[ξ1,ξ2,…,ξn+p+1]be a knot vector with1<m1,mn+p+1≤p+1andS̃l,S̃rtwopby2pmatrices where the entries ofS̃lare recursively defined by the rule(11)S̃1,1l=1,S̃1,2l=12,S̃i,il=12S̃i−1,i−1l,and(12)S̃i,jl=j−12(i−1)S̃i−1,j−1l+2i−j+12iS̃i,j−1l,fori+1≤j≤min(2i−1,p). In the case of2i−1≤p, we setS̃i,jl=12iS̃i,j−1lforj=2iandS̃i,jl=0otherwise. In contrary, if2i−1>p, we define(13)S̃i,jl=i(j−1)(i−1)(2i+p+1−j)S̃i−1,j−1l+2i−j+12i−j+p+1S̃i,j−1l−i(j−p−1)(i−1)(2i+p+1−j)S̃i−1,jl,forp+1≤j≤2(i−1), whereas we setS̃i,jl=2ip+2S̃i−1,j−1l+2p+2S̃i,j−1lforj=2i−1,S̃i,jl=1p+1S̃i,j−1lforj=2iandS̃i,jl=0otherwise. Furthermore, we define(14)S̃r≔[S̃p,2plS̃p,2p−1l…S̃p,1lS̃p−1,2plS̃p−1,2p−1l…S̃p−1,1l⋮⋮⋮S̃1,2plS̃1,2p−1l…S̃1,1l].Introducing the notation(15)S̃[k:r,s:t]ν≔[S̃k,sν…S̃k,tν⋮⋮S̃r,sν…S̃r,tν],k≤r,s≤t,ν∈{l,r},we obtain modified subdivision matrices(16)Sl=S̃[p+2−m1:p,p+2−m1:2p]l,Sr=S̃[1:m2−1,1:p+m2−1]r,for the basis functionsN1,pk,…,Nm1−1,pkandNn−m2+2,pk,…,Nn,pkon the left and the right boundary, respectively. Due to the local support the multiplicitiesmihave no impact on the remaining basis functions, i.e. the associated scaling factors must not be modified. The extension to the multivariate case follows in a straightforward manner by taking the tensor product structure of the basis functions into account.In order to perform a finite element analysis with local refinement, the previously introduced properties have to be satisfied for the refined basis as well. By applying the proposed subdivision procedure (see also Bornemann and Cirak  [29]) together with the spline selection rule presented by Kraft  [30], the refined basis is linearly independent and forms a partition of unity. Furthermore, since any finite linear combination ofCmcontinuous functions remainsCmcontinuous, the hierarchical local refinement can be applied to any system with higher continuity requirements. The remaining properties, the local support as well as the nonnegativity of the functions are preserved.The parametric domain as defined in the knot vectorΘcorrelates to the domainBˆ, independent of the existence of local refinements. The shape functionsRAcan be associated with a net of control pointsqA∈Rd, such that a geometrical mapF:Bˆ0→B0can be defined to link the parameter and the physical space(17)φh≔F(ξ)=RA(ξ)qA=Rpi(ξ)qi,cf. da Veiga et al.  [31]. Moreover,Fis a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism. The physical domain is the image of the parametric domain throughFwhich share the same regularity properties, see Brivadis et al.  [32].Accounting for local refinements in the physical space, the control meshes as well as associated primal variables (e.g. the actual position for solid mechanical problems, the velocity for fluid mechanical problems, the concentration for diffusion problems and phase-field parameters for the corresponding phase-field problems) need also to be refined. For an arbitrary fieldu(ξ)defined on levelkfollows(18)u(ξ)=Bkuk=(SBk+1)uk=Bk+1⋅(STuk),where we use a matrix representation of the subdivision matrix and the corresponding vector representation of the splines and the control points, cf. Bornemann and Cirak  [29] for details of such an implementation. Moreover, the control points associated with a subdivided spline have to be replaced by the newly calculated controls viauk+1=STuk. For coarsening, a least square fitting based on the rectangular subdivision matrix can be applied, see Jiang and Dolbow  [33].Note that the application of NURBS instead of B-spline basis functions in (18) necessitates the projection of the givend-dimensional NURBS geometry into a(d+1)-dimensional B-spline space. Afterwards, we refine the corresponding control net, given byq̃i=[q1,iwi,…,qd,iwi,wi]by calculating the control mesh of levelk+1viaq̃ik+1=STq̃ik. In a third step, we have to project the refined control net back to thed-dimensional NURBS space. Formally, this procedure is analogous to standard knot insertion techniques for NURBS.In Fig. 3, a one-dimensional example in physical spaceB=[0,1]with different local refinements up to the third level is displayed. The red line represents the sum of all shape functions, demonstrating that the partition of unity property is satisfied. The green line with markers at the bottom represents the element distribution in the physical space. Note that the evaluation of the shape functions at each Gauss point has to be implemented carefully. To do so, we calculate the absolute position of each Gauss point in the parametric domain beginning with the finest level.The semi-discrete system can be viewed as a set of ordinary differential equations, i.e. as a mathematical representation of a process that changes with time. Moreover, we assume that all states of the process in time can be determined uniquely and that the process is smooth and differentiable (in contrast to, e.g., contact mechanics). A state of the process at timet=0may be described by a pointu0hin the discrete phase spaceP, and its evolution in the time intervalI=[0,T]⊂RbyF(t,u0h), which describes the phase flow of the system, see Marsden and Ratiu  [34]. Finally, a smooth phase curveφh=F(t,u0h)has a tangent vector, the phase velocityφ̇h=v(φh), where a superposed dot denotes the partial differentiation with respect to time andv(X,t)≡dφh(X,t)dt=ddt|t=0Ft(u0h).The semi-discrete system under consideration can be represented at a specific timet∈Iin terms of a residual vector(19)R(u̇h,uh,t)=0.For a given time stepΔt=tn+1−tnin a discrete time intervalIh, we can reformulate the residual vector of the full discrete system such that(20)un+1h−unh=ΔtXH(unh,un+1h),whereXH:P×P→Rdis a smooth map. The approximate solution can be formulated as(21)XH(unh,un+1h)≈XH(un+θh).The first order backward Euler method is recovered from (21) byθ=1, the second order mid-point rule byθ=0.5. Further implicit time integration schemes like the trapezoidal rule, or the Newmarkα-method may be applied to the phase curve, depending on the specific structure of the problem.To reduce the computational cost an adaptive time step strategy can be applied. A standard rule for selecting the actual step size for the numerical integration of the initial-value ordinary differential equations is given as follows (cf. Gustafsson  [35])(22)Δtn+1=(αen+1)1pΔtn,whereen+1denotes a measure for the expected error and the parameterpis related to the order of the employed integration method. A suitable measure for the expected error is given by the formula(23)en+1=‖un−un−1‖‖un‖,with the coefficient vectorunof degrees of freedom for the considered field at timetn. With this choice ofen+1the difference betweenunandun−1determines the next step size. Moreover, the user-specified parameterαcontrols the sensitivity on differences betweenunandun−1for the step size selection.A continuous symmetry of a Hamiltonian system is equipped with an additional structure, which manifests itself in the form of conservation laws, see Gonzalez  [36] for a comprehensive review. Structure preserving integrators maintain the structure in the full discrete setting, see Hairer  [37], i.e., they preserve the Hamiltonian along with a certain class of other first integrals arising from the symmetries. To be specific, we consider algorithms of the form(24)G(unh,un+1h)=0,whereG(unh,un+1h)=un+1h−unh−ΔtXH(unh,un+1h).Assuming thatf(uh)is a first integral for (19), the orthogonality condition(25)Df(uh)⋅XH(uh)≡dfdt=0,has to be satisfied. We define the discrete derivative for the approximate solution in (20) as a mappingDf:P×P→Rdwith directionality condition(26)ΔtDf(unh,un+1h)⋅XH(unh,un+1h)=f(un+1h)−f(unh),which emanates from the fundamental theorem of calculus applied to (25), and with the consistency condition(27)Df(unh,un+1h)=Df(un+1/2h)+O(‖un+1h−unh‖2).This specific construction is of interest for systems with multiple symmetries. Here, we will apply the concept of a discrete derivative to the phase-field model for brittle fracture in Section  4.2, demonstrating the general superiority of this concept for mechanical multi-field systems.In this section different physical problems are presented which require for approximation at leastC1continuity. For the first system, a transient Kuramoto–Sivashinsky model, we provide an analytical solution in the one-dimensional case and compare the solution with simulation results obtained with different local refinements. The two-dimensional case will demonstrate the consistency of the chosen approach with local refinements. The second system presented in detail addresses a higher-order phase-field approach to brittle fracture in the fully non-linear regime. In such an application the use of a non-linear finite element method is mandatory due to the arising large deformations and motions. A dynamical benchmark example is presented subsequently. At last, two- and three-dimensional simulations of thermal diffusion in binary polymer blends are addressed. Again, local refinements are applied here to improve accuracy and convergence of the solution.Governing equations. Assume a Lipschitz bounded domainB⊂Rdin the time intervalI. Then the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky problem is stated as(28)u̇+νΔ2(u)+Δ(u)+αu−‖∇(u)‖2=0,with boundary and initial conditions, given as follows(29)∇u⋅n=0,∇(u+Δu)⋅n=0,and(30)u(x,0)=u0(x).Note, that (29) is often replaced by periodic boundary conditions. The constitutive parametersνandαare used to model diffusion induced chaos and dissipative structures in reaction–diffusion systems. Next we introduce the functional space of admissible test functions(31)Vu={δu∈H2(B)|∇δu=0on∂B×I}.The weak form of the problem reads(32)∫Bδuu̇dv+∫BνΔ(δu)Δ(u)dv−∫B∇(δu)⋅∇(u)dv+∫Bδu(αu−‖∇(u)‖2)dv=0,for allδu∈Vu, whereas the corresponding fully discrete system takes the form(33)δuA[∫BRARBdvuB,n+1−uB,nΔt+∫BνΔRAΔRBdvuB,n+θ−∫B∇RA⋅∇RBdvuB,n+θ+∫BRA(αRBuB,n+θ−‖∇RBuB,n+θ‖2)dv]=0.In a first step, a slightly simplified one-dimensional model presented in detail in Anders et al.  [7] is analyzed. Let the domainB=[L0,L]⊂Rbe defined in the time intervalI. The corresponding weak form reads(34)∫Bδuu̇dv+∫B∂2δu∂x2∂2u∂x2dv−∫B∂δu∂x∂u∂xdv−12∫B∂δu∂xu2dv=0,for allδu∈Vu. The analytical solution forB=[−30,30]is given by(35)u(x,t)=c+15191119(−9tanh(k(x−ct−x0))+11tanh3(k(x−ct−x0))),with parametersc=0.1,k=121119andx0=−10, see Fig. 4. The boundary conditionsu(−30,t)=g1(t)andu(30,t)=g2(t)and the initial conditionu(x,0)=u0(x), whereg1,g2andu0can be calculated from (35) along with the one-dimensional Kuramoto–Sivashinsky problem (34).In order to illustrate the capabilities of the hierarchical refinement concept we evaluate the deviation of the numerical solution related to the reference solution. To be specific, numerical results using a constant time steps sizeΔt=0.005are compared with analytical results at timet=2. To ensure consistency of the higher order approach, we apply first a uniform globalh-refinement scheme. Then, we refine the region passed by the shock wave within the time intervalI=[0,2]level-by-level up to the fourth level, see Fig. 5for details. The obtained results are plotted in Fig. 6; the displayed error is measured in theL2-norm‖u−uh‖2. For the globalh-refinement (see right hand side), the expected second order convergence is obtained. For the hierarchical refinement strategy, we achieved higher rates of convergence, see the left hand side of Fig. 6. The corresponding condition numbers of the stiffness matrix for both refinements are presented in Table 1.Next, we present the numerical results of the two-dimensional version of the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky problem (28) onB=[0,100]2. Following the investigations in Gomez and Paris  [6] we apply periodic boundary conditions and a uniform random perturbation between[−0.05,0.05]of the homogeneous fieldu=0as initial condition, shown on the left hand side of Fig. 7. Furthermore, we set the first constitutive parameterν=1, whereas the settings of the second parameter areα=0.225,α=0.210andα=0.195, respectively, to obtain the three basic states found by Paniconi and Elder  [3]. Here the hexagonal state (α=0.225) yields a spatially ordered stationary solution, the breathing hexagonal state (α=0.210) is characterized by a periodic oscillation of hexagonal cells and for the disordered state (α=0.195) the solution shows a chaotic behavior. The original mesh consists of 128×128 elements. A refined area of 20×20 elements for level 1 is located at the center of the domain to demonstrate the validity of the refinement technique for multivariate problems of higher order, see right hand side of Fig. 7. Finally, we show the numerical solution for the three basic states of the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky problem in Fig. 8for each case to four discrete points in time.RemarkWe observe forα=0.225that the time until the system achieved a perfect stationary solution is in general larger compared to the usage of a uniform 128×128 elements mesh. In a series of numerical test we observed that using a finer background mesh yields for both, the refined as well as the unrefined case, nearly identical results.Governing equations. The bounded domainB0⊂Rdwithd∈{1,2,3}, denotes the reference configuration, related to the current configuration via the deformation mappingφ(X,t):B0×I→Rdand the material configuration vectorX∈B0. Moreover the phase-field is introduced ass(X,t):B0×I→R. The phase-fields∈[0,1]represents a continuous field with unbroken states=0whereas the fully broken state is denoted bys=1.We assume the existence of a Helmholtz energy functionalΨ:B0×I→R,Ψ≔Ψ(Ci,s), whereCi=(Fi)TFidenotes the right Cauchy–Green tensor andFi:B0×I→Rd×dthe deformation gradient. The superscriptedidenotes the fracture insensitive part of the deformation gradient, defined as(36)Fi=∑a=1d(λa+)(1−s)λa−na⊗Na.Here,λa,a∈{1,…,d}represents the principal stretches, decomposed via(37)λa±≔〈λa−1〉±+1=[(λa−1)±|λa−1|]/2+1,see  [12,13,9] for details. Furthermore in Eq. (36) use has been made of the eigenvectorsna,Na, associated to the current and reference configuration, respectively. Accordingly, the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor is given by(38)S=2∂Ψ(Ci,s)∂C=∑a=1d1λa∂Ψ∂λai∂λai∂λaNa⊗Na,usingλai=(λa+)(1−s)λa−,a∈{1,…,d}for the ease of exposition. The weak form of the balance of linear momentum now reads in the reference configuration(39)∫B0δφ⋅ρ0v̇dV+∫B0S:(F)T∇X(δφ)dV=∫B0δφ⋅B̄dV+∫∂B0σδφ⋅T̄dA,∀δφ∈Vδφ,where we use the functional space of admissible test functionsδφ(40)Vδφ={δφ∈H1(B0)|δφ=0on∂B0φ}.The terms on the right hand side in (39) represent the external contributions and the natural and essential boundary conditions are given by(41)φ=φ̄on∂B0φ×Iand(FS)N=T̄on∂B0σ×I,along with initial conditions(42)φ(X,0)=X0andv(X,0)=v0inB0.Next, we introduce the phase-field model. In particular, we rewrite and extend the Helmholtz energy functional as follows(43)Ψaug=Ψ(Ci,s)+gcΓl(s).Therein, the last term can be interpreted as the crack energy of the fracture field, wheregcdenotes the critical energy release rate. The regularized crack surface topology of the phase-field approach is defined as follows(44)Γl(s)=∫B0γl(s)dV=∫B014l[s2+2l2∇(s)⋅∇(s)+l4Δ2(s)]dVwhereldenotes the intrinsic crack width. The corresponding weak form of the phase-field reads(45)∫B0δs(gc2ls+∂Ψ(Ci,s)∂s)+gcl∇(δs)⋅∇(s)+gcl32Δ(δs)Δ(s)dV=0,∀δs∈Vδs,where the functional spaces of admissible solution and test functions of the phase-field(46)Vs={s∈H2(B0)|s=s̄onΓ(t)}andVδs={δs∈H2(B0)|δs=0onΓ(t)},are introduced. Here,Γ(t)⊂Rn−1represents a sharp crack surface topology insideB0. The remaining boundary conditions are given by∇s⋅n=0on∂B0,Δs=0on∂B0and∇(l4Δs−2ls)=0on∂B0. Moreover, the initial conditions(X,0)=s0onB0completes the set of equations for the initial boundary value problem.Discretization. In contrast to the displacement field, the higher order phase-field approach requiresC1continuity. In order to avoid complex mesh transfers we employ a conform discretization of both fields and develop the weak form based on the formulation in Eqs. (39) and (45)(47)δqA⋅[MABvB,n+1−vB,nΔt+∫B0∇RA⋅Sn,n+1i,h∇RBdVqB,n+1/2]=δqA⋅[Fn+1/2A,ext],(48)δsA[∫B0gc2lRARBsB,n+1/2+gcl∇RA⋅∇RBsB,n+1/2+gcl32ΔRAΔRBsB,n+1/2dV]=−δsA∫B0(∂Ψ∂sA)n+1/2dV.The consistent mass matrix is denoted byMAB, whereasFn+12A,extrepresents the nodal external load vector. The algorithmic version of the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor for the construction of a structure preserving temporal discretization scheme is defined as follows(49)Sn,n+1i,h=2∂Ψn+1/2∂Ch+2Ψn+1−Ψn+gc(γn+1−γn)−∂Ψn+1/2∂Ch:ΔChΔCh:ΔChΔCh,where(50)Ψn+1/2=Ψ(Cn+1/2i,h,sn+1/2h),ΔCh=Cn+1h−Cnh.The proposed scheme (47)–(48) preserves algorithmically both momentum maps as well as total energy of the whole system, see Hesch and Weinberg  [13] for a detailed proof.Static problem. For the numerical investigations, a three dimensional plate of dimensions1×0.2×1with a horizontal notch as depicted in Fig. 9is considered. All values given in this section refer to the units N, mm, s and combinations thereof. Taking the classical fracture modes I, II and III into account, the three dimensional plate is investigated within an opening, an in-plane shear and an out-of-plane shear displacement driven setting. The constitutive behavior is governed by a hyperelastic compressible Neo-Hookean model with associated strain energy function(51)Ψ(Ci)=μ2(∑a=1d(λai)2−n)+λ2(ln(J))2−μln(J),J=∏a=1dλaiand the Lamé parameters are assumed to take the valuesλ=121.154e3andμ=80.769e3. The critical energy release rate is chosen asgc=2.7.The initial meshes are shown in Fig. 10for all applied loads and displacements. The boundary conditions are depicted in Fig. 9. The plate consists of 20×4×20 elements on level 0 and is decomposed using a consistent higher order domain decomposition method, such that a horizontal notch is introduced to the model. Additionally, the finite element mesh is locally refined to capture the different crack path according to the specific fracture mode:(I)Three local refinement levels are used for the pure tension test, see Fig. 10, left. In total 46,288 elements with overall 305,856 degrees of freedom and minimal element size ofhmin=0.0063are employed. The length-scale parameter is chosen asl=0.0025. Moreover, the displacement increment is set toΔu=5e−5.Two local refinement levels are used for the in-plane shear test, see Fig. 10, middle. In total 21,396 elements with overall 112,192 degrees of freedom and minimal element size ofhmin=0.0125are employed. The length-scale parameter is chosen asl=0.005and the displacement increment is set toΔu=1e-3.Two local refinement levels are used for the out-of-plane shear test, see Fig. 10, right. In total 21,480 with overall 113,632 degrees of freedom and minimal element size ofhmin=0.0125are employed. The length-scale parameter is chosen asl=0.005and the displacement increment is set toΔuy=1e−4.Transient problem. The dynamic fracture test deals with a transient problem consisting of a L-shaped block of size2.4×1.2×3.4, see Fig. 14, left. Again, a Neo-Hookean material model is considered and material constants are given as follows: Young’s modulusE=1000, a Poisson’s ratio of 0.45 and a mass density ofρ=0.01.For the phase-field a critical energy release rate ofgc=2.7with a length-scale parameter ofl=0.03are chosen. The body is subjected to a temporal pressure follower loadp(t)=pmaxsin(πt0.1),t∈[0,0.1]with peak loadpmax=10as depicted in Fig. 14. Afterwards, the body moves freely in space for the considered timet∈[0.1,0.5]. As before, the body is locally refined (see Fig. 15) and 3700 elements and 30,664 degrees of freedom (displacement and phase-field) are employed in total.The motion of the body is illustrated in Fig. 15. Due to the application of the proposed structure preserving scheme, both, the components of the discrete angular momentum as well as the total energy of the system, are preserved algorithmically, see Fig. 16.Governing equations. The mixture’s constitutive equation is deduced from the variation of a Ginzburg–Landau free energy functional(52)E(c,T)=kbTsysv∫BΨcon(c,T)+Ψsur(∇c)dV,(53)μ=δcE=kbTsysv(∂cΨcon(c,T)−λΔc),whereΨconis the configurational energy density andΨsur=λ2‖∇c‖2represents the interface energy. The parameterλ=κl2is related to the surface energy densityκand lengthlof the transition regions between each phase;T,kbandvdenote temperature, Boltzmann constant and the corresponding unit volume;Tsysis the system’s average temperature.The polymer blend considered here consists of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyethylmethylsiloxane (PEMS). We choose the concentration of PDMSc=cPDMSas order parameter and note that in the two-component mixturecPEMS=1−cPDMSholds. The configurational energy densityΨconis formulated according to Flory–Huggins thermodynamics of mixing,(54)Ψcon(c,T)=gAc+gB(1−c)+cNAln(c)+1−cNBln(1−c)+χ(T)c(1−c),whereNA,NBrepresent the degrees of polymerization of speciesAandBwhereas the termsgAc,gB(1−c)qualify the free energy of the individual components. The interaction parameterχdepends on the temperature and is usually set as(55)χ(T)=a+bT−1,whereaandbare fitting parameters obtained from experiments.The evolution of the field’s concentration and temperature in a representative domainBwithin timet̃is described by the extended Cahn–Hilliard equation coupled with the heat diffusion equation.(56)∂c∂t=∇⋅(M∇μ+DTc(1−c)∇T),inB×(0,t̃)(57)cpρ∂T∂t=∇⋅(k∇T)+αI,inB×(0,t̃).Initial concentration and temperature are given by(58)c(x,0)=c0(x),T(x,0)=T0(x),inB,along with the boundary conditions(59)(M∇μ+DTc(1−c)∇T)⋅n=0,on∂B×(0,t̃),∇c⋅n=0,on∂B×(0,t̃),T=T̃,on∂Be×(0,t̃),∇T⋅n=0,on∂Bn×(0,t̃),with properties∂B=∂Be∪∂Bnand∂Be∩∂Bn=0̸. For a detailed and thermodynamical consistent derivation of this model we refer to Anders and Weinberg  [14]. The Onsager tensorMis assumed to be isotropic and constant, i.e.M=MIwithM∈R;DTdenotes the thermal diffusion coefficient. The specific heat capacitycpand thermal conductivitykare assumed to have the form(60)cp(c,T)=cPPDMS(T)+(1−c)PPEMS(T),k(c,T)=cQPDMS(T)+(1−c)QPEMS(T),wherePPDMS,PPEMS,QPDMSandQPEMSare polynomial functions of degree 3 which fit the specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the two species forT∈[50K,340K]andT∈[230K,410K], respectively. Since the mass densities of PDMS (0.969g/cm3) and PEMS (0.977g/cm3) are very similar we set for convenienceρ=0.973g/cm3. Additional parameters are summarized in Table 2.In our numerical simulation phase separation induced by laser light absorption is studied. We apply two different kind of laser intensities, a wavy temperature field and a focused laser spot,(61)I(x)=I0cos(qx1),(62)I(x)=I0(x)∑i,j=1∞aijsin(iπx1lx1)sin(jπx2lx2).Discretization. Introducing the function spaces of admissible test functions(63)Vc={δc∈H2(B)∣∇δc=0on∂B×(0,t̃)},VT={δT∈H1(B)∣δT=0on∂Be×(0,t̃)},the weak forms of the boundary-value problems (56) and (57) are given by(64)ρ∫Bcp∂T∂tδTdV+∫Bk∇T⋅∇δTdV−α∫BIδTdV=0,∫B∂c∂tδcdV+M∫B∇∂cΨcon⋅∇δcdV+DT∫Bc(1−c)∇T⋅∇δcdV+λM∫BΔcΔδcdV=0,for allδc∈Vc,δT∈VT. The corresponding fully discretized system using a conform NURBS basis for the approximate functional spacesVcandVT, reads(65)ρΔt∫Bcp,n+1/2(Tn+1−Tn)RAdV+∫Bkn+1/2∇Tn+1/2⋅∇RAdV−α∫BIRAdV=0,1Δt∫B(cn+1−cn)RAdV+M∫B(∂c2Ψn+1/2con∇cn+1/2+∂c∂T∇Tn+1/2)⋅∇RAdV+DT∫Bcn+1/2(1−cn+1/2)∇Tn+1/2⋅∇RAdV+λM∫BΔcn+1/2ΔRAdV=0,for allA∈{1,…,n}.Temperature waves. The first numerical results are obtained within the regime of a spatially periodic forcing induced by the laser intensity function (61) on the domainB=[0μm,3μm]2, c.f. Fig. 18. Please note that throughout all illustrations of our numerical results the reddish areas denote the PDMS-rich A-phase and the blue domains represent the PEMS-rich B-phase. In the case under consideration the concentration varies between 0.433 (dark blue) and 0.61 (dark red). For our simulation we use an Onsager coefficient ofM=1.815⋅10−18m5/(J s), a thermal diffusivity ofDT=−2⋅10−13m2/(s K), an average temperature ofTsys=310.5Kand an initial temperature ofT0(x)=210.5K. Since PDMS is a thermophilic polymer its thermal diffusion coefficient has a negative sign. The corresponding unit volume isv=4π(σA/2)3/3whereas the laser intensity and the optical absorption coefficient are given byI0=3.75⋅107W m2andα=500m−1, respectively. We make use of the hierarchical refinement technique in the regions where the temperature gradient is assumed to be maximal, see Fig. 17for details, and set∂Bn=∂B. Starting from a nearly homogeneous one-phase configuration (c0(x)=0.55) the early stages of microstructural evolution are driven by spinodal decomposition of phases. Only gradually the periodic forcing asserts itself against the suppression of phase decomposition. Over time the temperature gradient increasingly coins the microstructure. A periodic stripe pattern evolves and destroys the typical coarsening known from standard Cahn–Hilliard systems.Focused laser spot. In the second example we simulate a focused laser spot pointing at the middle of the upper surface of an aged cuboidB=[0μm,1.5μm]2×[0μm,0.75μm], see Fig. 20. The diameter of the spot amounts to 1/5 of the surface width. In order to integrate this kind of local heating in our model we use the laser intensity function (62) withlx1=lx2=1.5μmand(66)I0(x)={3.2⋅1011W m−2,x∈M0W m−2,x∉M,where the setM⊂B∩∂Bis defined by(67)M≔{x|(x1−34μm)2+(x2−34μm)2≤320μm,2940μm≤x3≤34μm}.The remaining parameters are the same as in the prior example. Since we want to investigate domains where the thickness is small compared to length and width we apply periodic boundary conditions on the left/right and front/rear surfaces. The lower surface is assumed as∂BewithT̃(x)=T0whereas the upper boundary is set as∂Bn. Moreover, we refine the region of the upper boundary as shown on the right hand side of Fig. 19. At the beginning of our simulation we set the laser intensity (66) for nearly 2.5 s to zero to obtain an aged cuboid without the effect of thermal diffusion. A typical coarsening scenario can be seen in the picture 1–3 of Fig. 20. Afterwards, the middle of the upper surface is heated by the laser spot. As seen in the subsequent pictures of Fig. 20, an enrichment of PDMS in the heated region takes place whereas the microstructural evolution in the remaining region is driven by spinodal decomposition of phases. To be more precise the concentration here varies between 0.42 and 0.755.RemarkDuring our computational studies we observed that the temperature field remains nearly constant. This derives from the fact that the mass diffusion time is 103 times slower than the time scale for thermal diffusion. Therefore the temperature can be seen as quasi-constant in the considered periods of time.
