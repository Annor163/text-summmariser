@&#ABSTRACT@&#
For a given set of nodes in the plane the min-power centre is a point such that the cost of the star centred at this point and spanning all nodes is minimised. The cost of the star is defined as the sum of the costs of its nodes, where the cost of a node is an increasing function of the length of its longest incident edge. The min-power centre problem provides a model for optimally locating a cluster-head amongst a set of radio transmitters, however, the problem can also be formulated within a bicriteria location model involving the 1-centre and a generalised Fermat-Weber point, making it suitable for a variety of facility location problems. We use farthest point Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations to provide a complete geometric description of the min-power centre of a finite set of nodes in the Euclidean plane when cost is a quadratic function. This leads to a new linear-time algorithm for its construction when the convex hull of the nodes is given. We also provide an upper bound for the performance of the centroid as an approximation to the quadratic min-power centre. Finally, we briefly describe the relationship between solutions under quadratic cost and solutions under more general cost functions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
One of the most important problems in the optimal design of wireless ad hoc radio networks is that of power minimisation. This is true during the physical design phase and when designing efficient routing protocols (Montemanni, Leggieri, & Triki, 2008; Yuan & Haugland, 2012; Zhu, Huang, Chen, & Wang, 2012). The most appropriate fundamental model in both cases is the power efficient range assignment problem, where a communication range riis assigned to each transmitter xisuch the resultant network is connected and that total power∑riαis minimised (see Althaus et al., 2006). The exponent α is called the path loss exponent and most commonly takes a value between 2 and 4, with α=2 corresponding to transmission in free-space. In this paper we study a type of power efficient range assignment problem which allows for the introduction of a single additional transmitter in the plane. We show that this formulation is related to a continuous version of the cent-dian problem (Colebrook & Sicilia, 2007) from location analysis, and present a geometric method (based on farthest point Voronoi diagrams) of constructing the optimal solution when α=2.The classical range assignment problem, which does not include the option of introducing new transmitters, is a type of disk covering problem, where the centres of the disks are given nodes, the radii (ri) of the disks are transmission ranges, and the directed graph induced by the disks must satisfy a given connectivity constraint (for instance strong connectivity, biconnectivity, etc.) whilst minimising∑riα; see Fig. 1(a), where the graph drawn is not necessarily optimal. Observe that graphs that result from some assignment of ranges are similar to unit-disk graphs, except that the disks do not all have the same radius in our case. For any α>1 the range assignment problem is NP-hard, even in the case when only 1-connectivity is required of the resultant network (Fuchs, 2008).The idea of extending the classical range assignment problem by allowing the introduction of additional transmitters is justified because, during the design or maintenance of ad hoc radio networks, it is often pertinent to introduce relays or cluster-heads for the processing of aggregated data and for the improved routing efficiency that takes place in such hierarchical structures (see Dhanaraj & Murthy, 2007; Paul & Matin, 2011; Shi, Jia, & Hai tao, 2009). Solving the range assignment problem whilst allowing for the introduction of a bounded number of additional nodes anywhere in the plane constitutes a very general and highly applicable geometric network problem, which has only been solved in certain restricted settings (see for instance Brazil, Ras, & Thomas, 2012; Brazil, Ras, & Thomas, 2010). Since the optimal locations of the cluster-heads must be found, as well as the optimal assignment of ranges on the complete set of nodes, this so called geometric range assignment problem is at least as difficult as the classical range assignment problem. Note that this problem is a type of continuous location problem, since the cluster-heads are free to be located anywhere in the plane.This paper considers the problem of optimally locating a single cluster-head amongst a given set of transmitters, where each transmitter can send and receive data directly to and from the cluster-head. Not only is this an interesting and applicable model in it own right, but it is also a necessary first step in understanding the local structure of optimal networks with multiple cluster-heads. The graph induced by the assignment of ranges, in this case, contains an undirected star with the cluster head as its centre and the complete set of transmitters as its leaves; see for instance Fig. 1(b), where the white node represents a cluster-head.In more formal terms we denote the given finite set of transmitters byX⊂R2and the cluster-head bys∈R2. The power of any x∈X is Px=∥s−x∥αand the power of s is Ps=max{∥s−x∥α:x∈X}, where ∥·∥ is the Euclidean norm. The total power of the system is denoted byP(s)=Ps+∑x∈XPx, and a min-power centre of X is a point s∗ which minimises P(s). The min-power problem, which is the problem we address in this paper, seeks to locate a min-power centre of a given set X in the plane. Minimising only Psis clearly equivalent to the 1-centre problem, i.e., the problem of finding the centre of a minimum spanning circle for X. Minimising only∑Pxis a generalised Fermat-Weber problem (Brimberg & Love, 1999), which becomes the classical Fermat-Weber problem when α=1 and the problem of constructing the centroid when α=2.A concept in facility location that is related to the min-power problem is the computation of the centre-median (or cent-dian) of a finite set of points (Colebrook & Sicilia, 2007); although, strictly speaking, the cent-dian is only defined for α=1. The cent-dian problem requires one to find the Pareto-optimal solutions to the vector functionΦ(s)=(Ps,∑Px), which is equivalent to finding the optimal value ofλPs+(1-λ)∑Pxfor every λ∈ [0,1] (see Duin & Volgenant, 2012; Fernandez, Nickel, Puerto, & Rodríguez-Chía, 2001). The min-power problem may be viewed as a type of cent-dian problem, since it results by setting λ=1/2 and by allowing other values of α besides α=1. The cent-dian problem (with α=1) has been considered in the rectilinear plane (McGinnis & White, 1978), and for α=2 in the Euclidean plane (Ohsawa, 1999). Besides optimally locating a cluster-head amongst given transmitters, the cent-dian also has another application in wireless ad hoc networks, namely, finding a so called core node (Dvir & Segal, 2010). Bicriteria models such as the cent-dian have been described as seeking a balance between the antagonistic objectives of efficiency (i.e., the minisum component) and equity (i.e., the minimax component).There are numerical methods, for instance the sub-gradient method, that optimally locate a min-power centre to within any finite precision. However, structural results for the min-power centre problem, of the type described in this paper, are necessary for optimally constructing more complex geometric range assignment networks (which is the overarching goal of our research). This fact is particularly manifest in the design of algorithmic pruning modules, where one develops strategies based on properties of locally optimal structures for eliminating suboptimal network topologies from the exponential set of possible topologies. The ultimate benefits of good pruning modules has been demonstrated a number of times for problems similar to the geometric range assignment problem (Brazil et al., 2012; Brazil et al., 2010; Warme, Winter, & Zachariasen, 2000).In this paper we mostly focus on the quadratic case, α=2, and develop a complete geometric description of the solution in terms of farthest point Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations. In terms of cluster-head placement the α=2 assumption means that radio transmission takes place in free space, that is, in an ideal medium with zero resistance. Path loss exponents close to 2 frequently occur in real-world wireless radio network scenarios. This is true for transmission in mediums of low resistance, and in mediums of higher resistance when there is a degree of beam forming (constructive interference) (Karl & Willig, 2007). The quadratic case also applies to certain classical facility location problems, including the location of emergency facilities such as hospitals and fire stations (Fernandez et al., 2001; Ohsawa, 1999; Puerto, Rodríguez-Chía, & Tamir, 2010). Furthermore, as demonstrated in the final section, it is anticipated that theoretical developments in the α=2 case will lead to solutions and approximations for other α>1.Single-facility location problems under very general norms and convex cost functions have been studied by Durier (1995) and by Durier and Michelot (1985, 1994). Some of these formulations include the min-power problem as a special case, however, a constructive method of producing the min-power centre does not directly follow from their work. The principle contribution of the research presented by Durier and Michelot in these papers involves a description of the set of solutions to generalised Fermat-Weber problems, which is a feasible and interesting endeavour when the objective cost function is not strictly convex (as is the case with the min-power problem). Nickel, Puerto, and Rodríguez-Chía (2003) generalise this approach even further by allowing each given point (facility) to be replaced by a set of points, where an optimal centre is required to “serve” at least one point from each given set. A stochastic version of generalised single-facility location problems has also been studied (see Puerto & Rodríguez-Chía (2011)).In Section 2 we provide definitions and set up a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker formulation of the min-power centre problem and its dual for any α>1. When α=2 the geometric construction of the min-power centre becomes tractable, allowing us to provide a characterisation of the solution in terms of the farthest point Voronoi diagram on X, and its dual, the farthest point Delaunay triangulation. This characterisation is described in Section 3, where we also present a new linear-time algorithm for the construction of the optimal quadratic min-power centre. For α=2, Section 4 explores the significance of the centroid and the 1-centre of a set of points for the min-power centre problem, and provides a characterisation of point sets for which the min-power centre and the 1-centre coincide. Section 4 also provides a bound for the performance of the centroid as an approximation to the min-power centre. The final section briefly explores the general α>1 case.Let X={xi:i∈J} be a given finite set of points in the Euclidean plane with index-set J, and let α>1 be a given real number. For any points∈R2let G=G(s,X) be the undirected star with centre s and leaf-set X. The power of G with respect to s is denoted byP(s)=Pα(s,X)=∑i∈J‖s-xi‖α+maxi∈J{‖s-xi‖α},where ∥·∥ is the Euclidean norm. The first terms of P(s) can be thought of as representing the total power required by the existing transmitters for communicating with the cluster-head, while the second term can be thought of as the power required by the cluster-head for communicating with the transmitters.Definition: The Euclidean min-power centre problem on X is the problem of finding a pointsα∗∈argminsP(s). We refer tos∗=sα∗as a min-power centre of X.Lemma 1For any X the function P(s) is strictly convex, and therefore s∗is unique.This follows since ∥s−xi∥αis strictly convex when α>1, and the sum (or maximum) of strictly convex functions is strictly convex. □Although P(s) is not smooth, it can be expressed as the maximum of a set of smooth functions: for any j∈J letFj(s)=Fjα(s,X)=‖s-xj‖α+∑i∈J‖s-xi‖α. Then P(s)=maxj∈J{Fj(s)}. Since α>1, the gradient∇(‖s-xi‖α)=α(s-xi)‖s-xi‖α-2:s≠xi,0:s=xi,is continuous. Therefore Fjis continuously differentiable and convex, since it is the sum of such functions.Next we describe a useful non-linear programming formulation of the problem of finding s∗. Consider the following non-linear optimisation program.Problem P1minimise(s,v)∈R2×RvsubjecttoFj(s)-v⩽0,∀j∈J.Clearly Problem P1 is smooth and convex. It is easy to see that (s,v) is optimal for this problem if and only if s=s∗ and v=P(s∗).Lemma 2Problem P1 satisfies the Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification for any point(s,v)∈R2×R.Note that〈∇(Fj(s)-v),((0,0),1)〉=〈(∇Fj(s),-1),((0,0),1)〉<0for all j such that P(s)=Fj(s).□By the previous lemma and the resulting KKT conditions it follows that the point(s∗,v∗)∈R2×Ris optimal for Problem P1 if and only if there exist multipliersλj∗⩾0,j∈Jsuch that∇v+∑j∈Jλj∗(∇Fj(s∗),-1)=0andλj∗(Fj(s∗)-v∗)=0for all j∈J. Observe thatλj∗(Fj(s∗)-v∗)=0⇔λj∗(Fj(s∗)-P(s∗))=0⇔λj∗(‖s∗-xj‖α-maxi∈J{‖s∗-xi‖α})=0⇔λj∗(‖s∗-xj‖-maxi∈J{‖s∗-xi‖})=0Therefore we can state equivalent KKT conditions as follows: s∗ is the min-power centre of X if and only if there existsλj∗⩾0such that(1)∑j∈Jλj∗∇Fj(s∗)=0,(2)∑j∈Jλj∗=1,(3)λj∗(‖s∗-xj‖-maxi∈J{‖s∗-xi‖})=0,∀j∈J.Let n=∣J∣ and let λ=(λ1,…,λn). The dual of Problem P1 can be written asProblem D1maximiseλ∈Rnmins∈R2∑j∈J(1+λj)‖s-xj‖αsubjecttoλ⩾0,∑j∈Jλj=1.Finally, we can convert the dual problem to a more familiar form as follows. For every j∈J letτj=λj+1n+1. Therefore1n+1⩽τjand∑j∈Jτj=1. Lets(τ)=argmins∈R2∑j∈Jτj‖s-xj‖α(observe that s(τ) is unique). Clearly then∑j∈Jτj∇(‖s(τ)-xj‖α)=0, which is equivalent to∑j∈Jτj(s(τ)-xj)‖s(τ)-xj‖α-2=0. Therefore an equivalent formulation of Problem D1 is:Problem D1′(4)maximiseτ∈Rn(n+1)∑j∈Jτj‖s-xj‖α(5)subjectto1n+1⩽τj,(6)∑j∈Jτj=1,(7)∑j∈Jτj(s-xj)‖s-xj‖α-2=0.If τ∗ is optimal for Problem D1′ then s∗=s(τ∗) is optimal for Problem P1 and λ∗=(n+1)τ∗−1 gives the multipliers satisfying Eqs. (1)–(3). This final formulation is recognisable in that it is almost identical to the dual of the problemminimises∈R2maxj∈J‖s-xj‖α,which is the well-known minimum spanning circle problem (see Elzinga, Hearn, & Randolph, 1976 for a derivation). The only two differences in these duals are Inequality (5), which will be replaced by τj⩾0 for the minimum spanning circle problem, and the extra coefficient n+1 of the objective function. In general, the restriction on domain specified by Inequality (5) leads to a non-trivial variation on the minimum spanning circle problem, however, as shown in the next section, for α=2 there exists an interesting and useful geometric relationship between the minimum spanning circle problem and the min-power centre problem.In order to study the geometry of the case where α=2 we first rewrite the KKT conditions in terms of the 2-centroids of X.Definition: Recall that the centroid (or centre of mass) of X, which we denote as M, is defined byM=1n∑j∈Jxj. We define the set of 2-centroids of X to be the setM={Mj:j∈J}where eachMj=1n+1xj+∑i∈Jxi.Observe thatMis the image of an affine transformation on X. A consequence of this observation is the following lemma. Let conv (·) denote the convex hull of a set of points. By two planar polygonal regions being similar we mean that they have corresponding sides, all of which are in proportion.Lemma 3The regionconv(M)is similar to conv (X), and M is the centroid ofM. For any j the point Mjdivides the line segment Mxjinto a ratio of 1:n (seeFig. 2, where the Mjare grey-filled circles).For any X′⊆conv (X) we denote the image of X′ under the above affine transformation by ψ(X′), which is a subset ofconv(M). We also similarly employ ψ−1 for the inverse transformation.In the quadratic case (where α=2) we now write∇Fj(s)=2(n+1)s-2xj-2∑i∈Jxi=2(n+1)(s-Mj).This equation implies that for any j we haveMj=argmins{‖xj-s‖2+∑i∈J‖xi-s‖2}. In the case α=2, Conditions (1)–(3) for Problem P1 reduce to(8)s∗=∑j∈Jλj∗Mj,(9)∑j∈Jλj∗=1,(10)λj∗(‖s∗-xj‖-maxi∈J{‖s∗-xi‖})=0,∀j∈J.By Condition (8) we have:Lemma 4s∗∈conv(M).Conditions (8)–(10) can be interpreted by means of a dual pair of planar geometric graphs. Firstly letV=V(X)be the farthest point Voronoi diagram on X. This is a partition ofR2into maximal regions {V(xj):j∈J} such that s∈V(xj) if and only xjis a farthest node from s. It is well-known that V(x) is non-empty if and only if x is an extreme point (i.e., a “corner”) of conv (X). As is common practice, we will (without confusion) treatVboth as a graph specified by the boundary edges, or as a partition of the plane. It is well known thatVis a tree.LetD=D(X)be a farthest point Delaunay triangulation of X, which is defined as a triangulation of X such that the circumcircle of any triangle contains all points of X. The farthest point Delaunay triangulation is the dual graph ofV(Eppstein, 1992). IfVcontains a vertex of degree more than 3 thenDis not unique; in this case we letDbe any farthest point Delaunay triangulation on X. Fig. 3illustrates an example of both these graphs.A b-face ofVorDis a maximal region of dimension b, where 0⩽b⩽2. Therefore a 0-face is a vertex, a 1-face is an edge, and a 2-face is a region ofVorD. The dual relationship betweenDandVdefines a natural mapping from each b-face ofDto a (2−b)-face ofV. In Fig. 3 the 0-face x ofDmaps to the 2-face V(x) ofV, and the 2-face D ofDmaps to the 0-face VDofV. Observe that dual 1-faces are always perpendicular to each other. If the maximum degree ofVis at most 3 then the mapping between faces is a bijection. In the case of vertices of degree more than 3 we still get a bijection if we consider every such vertex as consisting of a number of degree 3 vertices connected by zero-length edges, where the topology is uniquely determined by the choice ofD. The unique pairs in the bijection will be referred to as dual faces. For any b-face D ofDwe denote by VDits dual face. Formally the bijection is defined as D↔VDif and only ifVD=⋂j∈JDV(xj)where JDis the index set of the extreme points of D.Observe in Fig. 3 that there exists a Delaunay triangle D1 that strictly contains its dual face inV, depicted by the unlabelled empty circle. As will become clear below, this dual relationship is unique and, in fact, the unlabelled empty circle is the centre of the minimum spanning circle (called the 1-centre) of X. We will show that something similar holds for the min-power centre problem.Before proving the main theorem, we note that it is often the case when solving minimax non-linear programs that a complete solution can be arrived at by considering the various combinations of functions which are potentially active at the optimal solution. Hence we introduce the following lemma which allows us to restrict the number of combinations.Lemma 5There exists a set of multipliers {λj:j∈J} satisfying KKT Conditions(8)–(10)and containing at most 3 non-zero elements.Suppose thats∗=∑j∈Jλj∗Mjand thatJ0={j:λj∗>0,j∈J}contains at least 4 elements. Therefores∗=∑j∈J0λj∗Mjands∗∈conv(M0), whereM0={Mj:j∈J0}. For any j∈J0, since Fj(s∗)=P(s∗) it follows that xjlies on a vertex ofVand is an extreme point of conv (X). Therefore, by Lemma 3, Mjis an extreme point ofconv(M)for all j∈J0. By Carathéodory’s theorem any point in the convex hull ofM0can be expressed as a convex combination of at most three extreme points. Lets∗=∑j∈J∗ujMjfor some J∗⊂J0 containing at most three elements, where uj>0 and∑j∈J∗uj=1. Let λj=0 for all j∈J⧹J∗ and let λj=ujfor j∈J∗. Then {λj:j∈J} and s∗ satisfy the KKT conditions.□From now on it is assumed that the KKT set associated with s∗ is{λj∗:j∈J}=Λ∪{λj∗:j∈J⧹J∗}, whereλj∗>0if and only if j∈J∗, andΛ=λj∗:j∈J∗is of minimal cardinality. From the above proof it follows that there may be more than one choice for this minimal set of multipliers. For consistency we assume that the multipliers are chosen so that there exists a Delaunay faceD∈Dsuch that {xj:j∈J∗} is the set of extreme points of D.Let ri (·) denote the relative interior of a closed region (b-face).Theorem 6A point s is the optimal min-power centre for X if and only if s∈ri (ψ(D)) and s∈VDfor some face D ofD.Suppose that s=s∗ is optimal and let R be the face (node, edge, or triangle) defined by R=conv ({Mj:j∈J∗}). By complementary slackness we have ∥s∗−xj∥=maxi∈J{∥s∗−xi∥} for every j∈J∗. Therefore the disk centred at s∗ and containing the points {xj:j∈J∗} on its boundary covers all points of X. By the definition of farthest point Delaunay triangulations, ψ−1(R)=conv ({xj:j∈J∗}) is a face ofD. Since J∗ has minimal cardinality and s∗ is a convex combination of the extreme points of R we must have s∗∈ri (R). Finally, note thats∗∈⋂j∈J∗V(xj), which implies that s∗ is also an element of the dual face of ψ−1(R). Letting D=ψ−1(R) proves necessity.To prove sufficiency we assume that s∈ri (ψ(D)) and s∈VDfor some face D ofD. Let JD={j:Mjis an extreme point of ψ(D)} and let {uj:j∈JD} be a set of positive weights such that∑uj=1ands=∑ujMj. Let {λj:j∈J} be a set of multipliers such that λi=uifor all i∈JD, and all other λi=0. We only need to show still that complementary slackness holds with respect to s, λ. Let xkbe any point of X. Since VDis the dual of D we haves∈⋂j∈JDV(xj). Therefore if k∈JDthen ∥s−xk∥−max{∥s−xi∥:i∈J}=0. Therefore λj(∥s−xj∥−max{∥s−xi∥:i∈J})=0 for all j∈J, which implies that s is optimal.□Fig. 4illustrates the three different cases that arise based on the number of active functions at s∗. When ∣Λ∣=1 then s∗∈ri (V(xj)) for some j. Therefore we can find s∗ by simply solving ∇ Fj(s)=0. Also, by Ohsawa (1999) the point s∗ must lie on the line joining M to the node of X farthest from M, say xr. The next lemma now follows immediately from these observations.Lemma 7If s∗∈ri (V(xj)) for some j∈J, then s∗=Mr.The convention of using xrto represent the node of X farthest from M will hold throughout the rest of this paper. Using Theorem 6 it is possible to design a fast geometric algorithm for finding s∗.AlgorithmInput: the set of coordinates XOutput: the point s∗– ConstructV– ConstructMr. Perform point location forMrinV(xr)– IfMr∈V(xr) thens∗=Mrand exit– For every edgee=V(xi)∩V(xj) do–ConstructMiMj–IfMiMj∩e≠∅ thens∗=MiMj∩eand exit– For every vertexv=V(xi)∩V(xj)∩V(xk) do–Construct ▵MiMjMk–Perform point location forvin ▵MiMjMk–Ifv∈▵MiMjMkthen s∗=v and exitConstructing the farthest point Voronoi diagram can be done in O(n logn) time from scratch or in O(n) time if the convex hull of X is given. From any face VDofVthe face ψ(D) can be constructed in constant time. The point location for Mrin V(xr) requires O(logn) time, but the point location for any v in a ▵MiMjMkrequires only constant time. Since the structural complexity ofVis O(n), analysing every face ofVuntil Theorem 6 is confirmed also takes O(n) time. The total complexity of the algorithm is therefore O(n) when the convex hull of X is given.Ohsawa’s algorithm (Ohsawa, 1999) for finding the efficient solutions to the vector minimisation problem v-min Φ(s), where Φ(s)= (max{∥s−xj∥},F(s)), can also find s∗. There is no theoretical gain in the runtime of our algorithm over the algorithm of Ohsawa, but with modifications our algorithm should perform better in practice. We provide an intuitive reason for this as follows. As is well-known, for any set of n points X the expected number of points that are extreme points of conv (X) is O(logn). Therefore the expected complexity of the farthest point Voronoi diagram does not increase very quickly as n increases. Now both M and s∗ are inconv(M), butconv(M)becomes smaller the more we increase n (note thatMis contained in a disk of radius1n+1‖M-xr‖). Therefore we suggest that if we modify our algorithm so that it begins by checking edges and vertices ofVclose to M, that the expected number of steps before s∗ is found will be small for large n. In contrast, for a fixed polygon representing a convex hull, and a fixed point in the polygon representing a centroid, the cardinality of a set X with this convex hull and centroid will not affect the practical runtime of Ohsawa’s algorithm. Of course, Ohsawa’s algorithm could also be modified to begin with points close to M, but his paper presents no theoretical justification for doing this.It is clear from the results so far that the centroid M plays a central role in the min-power centre problem when α=2. In particular, it is intuitive that M is always relatively close to the min-power centre, s∗, since both lie inconv(M). This fact leads to a theorem at the end of this section which places an upper bound on the performance ratio of approximating the min-power centre by the centroid. The fact that M is a “special” point in the min-power centre problem was also observed in Ohsawa (1999), where it is shown that any Pareto optimal solution to the vector minimisation problem v-min Φ(s) lies on a simple path connecting M and the 1-centre of X (recall that Φ(s)=(Ps,F(s)), where Ps=max{∥s−x∥2:x∈X} andF(s)=∑x∈X‖s-x‖2). Interestingly, this path is piecewise linear, consisting of one segment joining M to a point on an edge ofV, and with the remainder of the path lying on the edges ofV. Since the min-power centre is Pareto optimal for v-min Φ(s) it follows that s∗ is also on this path. This brings us to a second question: what role does the 1-centre play in the min-power centre problem? We will address this question next before returning to the discussion on M.Denote the 1-centre of X by C and letM∗={Mj:j∈J∗}, where, as before, J∗ is minimal. Therefores∗∈ri(conv(M∗)). The next lemma is given without proof as it follows from an argument similar to the proof of Theorem 6.Lemma 8A point s is the 1-centre of X if and only if s∈ri (D) and s∈VDfor some face D ofD.IfM∈conv(M∗)then s∗=C.Clearly ∣J∗∣>1, since if ∣J∗∣=1 then s∗=Mr, but Mrand M are always distinct. LetX∗=ψ-1(M∗). SinceM∈conv(M∗)we have, by Lemma 3, the fact thatconv(M∗)does not intersect the exterior of conv (X∗). Therefore, sinces∗∈ri(conv(M∗))it follows that s∗∈ri ( conv (X∗)). By letting D=conv (X∗) it follows from Lemma 8 that s∗=C as required.□The converse of this result does not appear to hold, but, once again by the result of Ohsawa (1999) which says that s∗ lies on a path connecting M and C, it follows that M is the min-power centre of X if and only if M and C coincide.Our final result on the role of C in the min-power centre problem relates to point sets X that are more or less evenly distributed (with respect to distance) about their centroid. The proof utilises the formulation of Problem D1′, which, as mentioned before, is almost exactly the dual of the minimum spanning circle problem except that the domain of the τjis further restricted by Inequality (5). Note that when α=2 we can write Eq. (7) ass=∑τjxjsince∑τj=1. Therefore, for α=2 we have:Problem D2 (dual of the minimum spanning circle problem)(11)maximiseτ∈Rn∑j∈Jτj‖s(τ)-xj‖2subjectto0⩽τj,(12)∑j∈Jτj=1,(13)s(τ)=∑j∈Jτjxj.Consider an optimal solution τ∗ to Problem D2. Therefore s(τ∗)=C. Ifτj∗⩾1n+1for all j∈J then τ∗ must also be optimal for Problem D1′. By complementary slackness the fact thatτj∗⩾1n+1>0implies that ∥C−xj∥−maxi∈J∥C−xi∥=0. Hence all points of X are concyclic about C. To see what the domain restrictionτj∗⩾1n+1means geometrically we first need a lemma.Lemma 10If there exists affine weightsτj⩾1n+1such thats=∑τjxjthens∈conv(M).Ifτj⩾1n+1for all j∈J thens=∑1n+1xj+∑ujxjwhere uj⩾0 and∑uj=1n+1. Lety=∑ujxj∑uj=(n+1)∑ujxj; note that y∈conv (X). Hences=nn+1M+1n+1y, which implies that‖s-M‖=1n+1‖M-y‖⩽1n+1‖M-y′‖, where y′ is on the boundary of conv (X) and M,y,y′ are collinear. The result now follows from Lemma 3.□The converse of this lemma is not true in general, however, by similar reasoning we have:Lemma 11Ifs∈conv(M)and s is equidistant from all nodes of X then there exists affine weightsτj⩾1n+1such thats=∑τjxj.Therefore we have the following final result on C, which follows directly from the above discussion and lemma.Proposition 12Suppose that C is equidistant from all points of X. Then C is the min-power centre of X if and only ifC∈conv(M).In some sense it seems we cannot say anything about the location of s∗ without involving M. In fact, let Q be a polygon with at most n extreme points. For any point set X with convex hull Q, if there is no restriction on the location of M then there is no restriction on the location of s∗ (except, of course, that s∗ must lie in Q). We make this notion clear in the next proposition before closing the section with a proof that the centroid is a good approximation for the min-power centre.Proposition 13For any point w∈ri (conv (X)), where w is on a vertex or edge ofV, there exists a set of points X′ such that the extreme points of conv (X) and conv (X′) coincide and such that the min-power centre of X′ is w.We demonstrate the case when w is in the interior of an edge e ofV; the other case is similar. Let X′ initially consist of the extreme points of conv (X) only. We introduce points to the interior of conv (X′) to get the final X′, which means thatV(X)=V(X′)throughout. Suppose that e is a portion of V(xa)∩V(xb) for some a,b. Then w is the min-power centre of X′ if and only if w also lies on the segment MaMb– therefore suppose that this is not the case. Letu=12(Ma+Mb)and let y∈ri (conv (X)) be a point on the line intersecting u and w such that w is between y and u; see Fig. 5. Let ε=∥y−w∥>0.We introduce m>0 new nodes at the point y and, for j=a, b, letMj′=1n+m+1xj+my+∑i∈Jxi. ClearlyMj′is the centre of mass of Mjand y (weighted n+1 and m respectively), and thereforeMj′divides the segment yMainto the ratio‖Ma-Ma′‖:‖Ma′-y‖=m:n+1; in fact, the segments xbxa, MbMaandMb′Ma′are all parallel. In order for w to be optimal for the resultant X′ the segmentMa′Mb′must intersect w, which is equivalent to requiring thatε=1m(n+1)‖w-u‖. The integer m can therefore be selected to be large enough so that the point y resulting from the subsequent value of ε will be in the convex hull of X.□In the case when w from the previous proposition lies in the interior of a region ofV, a similar process will produce an optimal point arbitrarily close to w. It is also relatively straightforward to extend the proposition to the case where no two nodes may coincide, and to the case where all nodes of X′ are required to lie on the boundary of the convex hull of X. Any other interesting general restrictions on the location of s∗ that do not involve M would therefore probably be for sets of nodes in convex position (i.e., where every node is an extreme point). We leave this as an open question.The centroid is very easy to calculate – it can be done in constant time given the locations of the xj. Theorem 15 shows that M is an appropriate point for approximating s∗, especially in applications with large n. For any set of points X letρ(X)=P(M)P(s∗).To place an upper bound on ρ we first need a lemma. Recall once again that xris the farthest node from M.Lemma 14∥Mr−xr∥⩽∥s∗−xr∥.‖xr-M‖⩽‖s∗-xr‖+‖s∗-M‖(bythetriangleinequality)⩽‖s∗-xr‖+‖Mr-M‖(Mristhefarthestpointofconv(M)fromM).Therefore‖s∗-xr‖⩾‖xr-M‖-‖Mr-M‖=‖Mr-xr‖.□Let k be the number of farthest elements of X from s∗. Thenρ(X)⩽1k+1n+1n2+kk+1.Recall that for any point y we denote by F(y) the sumF(y)=∑j∈J‖y-xi‖2. Let xp∈X be a farthest node from s∗. By the triangle inequality ∥M−xr∥⩽∥s∗−M∥+∥s∗−xr∥⩽∥s∗−M∥+∥s∗−xp∥.Therefore‖M-xr‖‖s∗-xp‖⩽‖s∗-M‖‖s∗-xp‖+1⩽‖Mr-M‖‖s∗-xr‖+1(sinces∗∈M)⩽‖Mr-M‖‖Mr-xr‖+1(byLemma14)=1n+1=n+1n(byLemma 3).We now haveP(M)P(s∗)⩽‖M-xr‖2+F(s∗)‖s∗-xp‖2+F(s∗)(sinceMminimisesF)=‖M-xr‖2-‖s∗-xp‖2‖s∗-xp‖2+F(s∗)+1⩽‖M-xr‖2-‖s∗-xp‖2(k+1)‖s∗-xp‖2+1(sinceklongestedgesareequal)=‖M-xr‖2(k+1)‖s∗-xp‖2+kk+1⩽1k+1n+1n2+kk+1.□Since k⩾1 we conclude thatρ(X)⩽12n+1n2+12for any X. The above approximation clearly improves as n increases.The situation when α≠2 is complicated by the fact that the level curves of the Fjare no longer circular. In particular, this implies that there are no easily constructed and useful fixed points directly analogous to the Mj. Even though the farthest point Voronoi diagram still plays a crucial role for general α, there is no simple dual structure analogous to the Delaunay triangulation. We may considerargmins∑‖s-xj‖α(the generalised Fermat-Weber point) as an analogue for M, however, a compass and straight-edge construction of this point is almost certainly impossible since even the classical Fermat-Weber point is, in general, not constructible in this way when n>4 (see Bajaj, 1988).This section will show, however, that not all insights gained for the α=2 case are lost when α≠2. In fact, there are several important uses for the mathematical machinery developed in the preceding sections. Firstly, as discussed in the introduction, path loss exponents close to α=2 often occur in real radio network scenarios. It seems evident that s∗ (and even M) will serve as a good approximation points for min-power centres based on α close to 2.Also, some of the results from the previous section, especially those involving the 1-centre C, are directly applicable for any α>1. The conceptual framework that we present for proving these results consists of transforming the set X into a new set X(s) such that the general α>1min-power centre problem on X is transformed into the quadratic min-power centre problem on X(s). Preliminary research indicates that this framework will also be useful for the development of bounds on the performance of s∗ or the centroid as approximation points for general α.We first state some notation and a lemma. Recall, from Section 2, that the power of the star G centred at s with leaf-set X and for a given α is denoted Pα(s,X), and thatPα(s,X)=maxj∈J{Fjα(s,X)}. We also similarly generalise the definition of F(s) to Fα(s,X). The point minimising Pα(s,X) is now denoted bysα∗. Next we describe the construction of the set X(s). Essentially, each vector xi−s is transformed into a vector xi(s)−s such that ∥xi−s∥α−1=∥xi(s)−s∥. The convex hull of the resultant set of nodes will therefore contain the convex hull of X when α⩾2, with the inverse of this property holding when α<2. In formal terms, for any point s let xi(s)=s+∥s−xi∥α−2(xi−s) and let X(s)={xj(s):j∈J}. Let M(s) be the centre of mass of X(s), and let Mj(s) be the jth 2-centroid of X(s). Some of these concepts are illustrated in Fig. 6for the set X(s) with s=C and α<2.Lemma 16Let s′ be any point. Then s=s′ minimises P2(s,X(s′)) if and only ifs′=sα∗.Suppose thats′=sα∗. Sincesα∗is optimal for Pαthe following KKT conditions are satisfied: there exist multipliersτj∗such that (A):1n+1⩽τj∗for all j; (B):∑τj∗=1; (C):∑τj∗sα∗-xj‖sα∗-xj‖α-2=0; and (D):τj∗‖sα∗-xj‖-maxi‖sα∗-xi‖=0for all j. Note that (C) can be written as∑τj∗sα∗-xjsα∗=0. Therefore conditions (A)-(C) are the first three KKT conditions forsα∗being optimal for P2 onXsα∗. We only need to still show complementary slackness. Note that‖sα∗-xjsα∗‖=‖sα∗-xj‖α-1, so that ifτj∗>0then‖sα∗-xj‖=maxi‖sα∗-xi‖, which implies that‖sα∗-xjsα∗‖=maxi‖sα∗-xisα∗‖. Therefore complementary slackness also holds for P2 atsα∗. The other direction follows similarly.□The next proposition is a direct generalisation of Proposition 12 and follows from the previous lemma. An example is illustrated in Fig. 6.Proposition 17Suppose that C is equidistant from all points of X. Thensα∗=Cif and only if C∈conv ({Mj(C)}).Suppose thatsα∗=C. Then, sincesα∗minimisesP2(s,Xsα∗), we must haveC=sα∗∈convMjsα∗=conv({Mj(C)})by KKT Condition (8). Next suppose that C∈conv ({Mj(C)}). Note that C is also the 1-centre of X(C) since all points are equidistant from C. Therefore C minimises P2(s,X(C)) by Proposition 12, and therefore minimises Pα(s,X) by Lemma 16.□This proposition can be strengthened, as shown the following result.Proposition 18Ifs2∗is equidistant from all point of X thensα∗=s2∗.Observe thatXs2∗is a uniform scaling of X from the points2∗. Sinces2∗minimises P2(s,X) it also minimisesP2s,Xs2∗. Therefore, by Lemma 16,s2∗=sα∗.□As a final observation note that as α tends to infinity the longest edge incident tosα∗dominates Fα(s,X). Therefore, since C minimises max{∥s−xj∥α}, and Pα(s,X)=max{∥s−xj∥α}+Fα(s,X), we have the following result.Observation 19limα→∞sα∗=C.
