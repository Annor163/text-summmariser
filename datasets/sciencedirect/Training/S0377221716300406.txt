@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Preventive maintenance over the warranty period has a crucial effect on the warranty servicing cost. Numerous papers on the optimal maintenance strategies for warranted items have focused on the case of items from homogeneous populations. However, most of real life populations are heterogeneous. In this paper, we assume that an item is randomly selected from a mixed population composed of two stochastically ordered subpopulations and that the subpopulation, from which the item is chosen, is unknown. As the operational history of an item contains the information on the chosen subpopulation, we utilize this information to develop and justify a new information-based warranty policy. For illustration of the proposed model, we provide and discuss relevant numerical examples.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The warranty is an important contract between a manufacturer and a buyer and requires the manufacturer to have the responsibility to repair or replace all failures occurring during a pre-specified period. Accordingly, a proper warranty strategy is fundamental for manufacturer to reduce the warranty servicing costs. Blischke and Murthy (1992) presented the concept and theoretical models for basic warranty. Of particular interest are the early papers of Biedenweg (1981), Nguyen and Murthy (1986) and Murthy and Nguyen (1988), where the optimal strategy is proposed by using the technique of dividing the warranty period into distinct intervals according to replacement and repair actions. For instance, in Biedenweg (1981), the failed items are replaced (by the manufacturer) by the new ones from the time of purchase until a prescribed time, and any further failures occurring during the remainder of the warranty period are rectified by a repair action. More comprehensive and extensive discussion on the optimal replace-repair strategy under warranty can be found, e.g., in Jack and Van der Duyn Schouten (2000), Zuo, Liu, and Murthy (2000) and Jack and Murthy (2001) to name a few.One possible way of reducing the warranty servicing costs is to incorporate effective preventive maintenance (PM) actions into the warranty policy. For deteriorating and repairable items, PM actions are performed at a planned time(s) to make the item ‘younger’ while it is still in the operating state. From the manufacturer's perspective, although the PM actions impose additional costs, the item's improvement due to the PM actions could reduce the warranty servicing costs over the warranty period. The warranty models with PM have been intensively studied in the literature (see, e.g., Sahin & Polatoglu, 1996; Monga & Zuo,1998; Yeh & Lo, 2001; Jack & Murthy, 2002; Kim, Djamaludin, & Murthy, 2004; Chien, 2008; Chang & Chien, 2012; Yeh, Kurniati, & Chang, 2015; Chien & Zhang, 2015; Liu, Wu, & Xie, 2015; Huang et al., 2015; Wang, Liu, & Liu, 2015).Throughout this paper, we will deal with the warranty policy with PM from the manufacturer's perspective. Our goal is to define optimal maintenance strategies under warranty which minimize the warranty servicing costs. To the best of our knowledge, most of research on the warranty with PM modeling was performed under the assumption that a population of items is homogeneous with respect to reliability characteristics, i.e., that their lifetimes can be described by the same probability distribution. However, the real life populations are usually heterogeneous. Therefore, it is quite a challenge to incorporate heterogeneity into the framework of warranty modeling. Note that the concept of heterogeneity has been a central issue in many disciplines such as biology, ecology, demography, survival analysis and reliability modeling (see, e.g., Dushoff & Levin, 1995; Kendall, Gordon, Fujiwara, & Nogeire, 2011; Keyfitz & Casewell, 2005; Vaupel & Yashin, 1985; Badía, Berrade, & Campos, 2003; Cha & Finkelstein, 2011; Finkelstein & Cha, 2013).In this paper, we propose a new warranty policy for items from a heterogeneous population. The item is randomly selected from a mixed population which consists of two stochastically ordered subpopulations and it is assumed that the subpopulation from which the item is selected is unknown. Here, by the ‘two stochastically ordered subpopulations’, we mean that the lifetime of items from one subpopulation is larger (or smaller) than that of the other subpopulation in a suitable stochastic sense. Operation history of an operating repairable item (e.g., its sequential failure times) obviously depends on the subpopulation from which it has been chosen. This operational history of the repairable items plays an important role in providing important information about reliability characteristics of items, which in turn helps us to establish a more effective maintenance strategy under warranty. While there exists literature which utilizes the historical data to estimate the degradation of the product and make warranty-related decisions (see, e.g., Fang & Huang, 2010; Guida, Pulcini, & Vainello, 2009; Majeske, 2007; Silver & Fiechter, 1995), in this paper, we use a different type of information. We apply different maintenance actions during warranty to the items depending on the classification of an item as belonging to a weak or strong. This classification is performed using the operational history data. We suggest and discuss the corresponding information-based warranty policy and show that it is more cost-effective than the conventional one that does not use operational information.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the population structure is described and the information-based warranty policy is suggested. Under the proposed warranty policy, the general expression for the warranty servicing cost function is also derived and the two-stage optimization procedure is briefly discussed. In Section 3, a generalization of the proposed warranty policy is considered. In Section 4, several numerical examples are provided for illustration. Furthermore, the extension of the proposed information-based warranty policy to the case of multiple PMs is discussed in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6, the concluding remarks are given.In this section, we will provide a ‘general formulation’ for the information-based warranty policy. Suppose that a population of items is a mixture of two stochastically ordered subpopulations. The subpopulation of items with (stochastically) shorter lifetimes will be, just for convenience, called the ‘weak subpopulation’, whereas that of items with relatively longer lifetimes will be called the ‘strong subpopulation’. Denote the lifetime of an item from the weak subpopulation by TWand its absolutely continuous Cdf, pdf and the failure rate function by F1(t), f1(t) and λ1(t), respectively. Similarly, the lifetime, the Cdf, pdf and the failure rate function of an item from the strong subpopulation are denoted by TS, F2(t), f2(t) and λ2(t), accordingly. Mathematical definitions of weak and strong subpopulations will be given after introducing the notation. The initial(t=0)composition of our mixed population is as follows: the proportion of the weak items is π, whereas the proportion of the strong items is1−π, which means that the corresponding frailty variable Z (Finkelstein & Cha, 2013) in this case has a discrete probability distribution:(1)π(z)={π,z=1,1−π,z=2,wherez=iindicates the ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ subpopulations,i=1,2, respectively. For convenience, in the following, we will let π1 ≡ π andπ2≡1−π. The mixture (population) survival function denoted byF¯m(t)is(2)F¯m(t)=π1F¯1(t)+π2F¯2(t),whereF¯i(t)=1−Fi(t),i=1,2. Then the mixture (the observed or the population) failure rate isλm(t)=π1f1(t)+π2f2(t)π1F¯1(t)+π2F¯2(t)=π1(t)λ1(t)+π2(t)λ2(t),where the corresponding time-dependent probabilities areπ1(t)=π1F¯1(t)π1F¯1(t)+π2F¯2(t),π2(t)=π2F¯2(t)π1F¯1(t)+π2F¯2(t).Assume further that the subpopulations are ordered (and thus, the weak and strong subpopulations are now mathematically defined) in the sense of the failure rate ordering (see, e.g., Shaked & Shanthikumar, 2007).(3)λ1(t)>λ2(t),t>0.Furthermore, for deteriorating items, it is reasonable to assume that the failure rates corresponding to each subpopulation are strictly increasing. Then, in principle, the cost-effectiveness of the PM during the warranty period could be justified.It should be noted that, in practice, most often, populations of manufactured items are composed of two ordered subpopulations: the subpopulation with normal lifetimes (Main (Strong) Distribution) and the subpopulations with relatively shorter lifetimes (Weak Distribution). Items belonging to the ‘weak distribution’ can be produced along with the items of the ‘main distribution’ due to, for example, defective resources and components, human errors, unstable production environment caused by uncontrolled significant quality factors, etc. (See, Jensen & Petersen, 1982; Kececioglu & Sun, 2003).Our approach generalizes the conventional warranty policy developed for items from homogeneous populations (see, e.g., Biedenweg,1981) that does not consider the operational history to the case of heterogeneous populations taking into account the corresponding operational history of items. The latter is a major challenge of this paper.Our setting is as follows: A new item is randomly chosen from the mixed population described above and it is assumed that the subpopulation from which the item is selected is unknown. We also assume that under the non-renewing warranty with the warranty period W, the item is minimally repaired at all failures and preventively maintained at a fixed time T < W without any cost to the buyers in [0, W]. Thus we consider here a free repair/replacement, one-dimensional warranty policy. Under these assumptions, we will derive the corresponding expected warranty servicing cost.Let cmbe the cost of minimal repair and cPMbe the cost of the PM. To motivate the information-based warranty policy to be discussed inSection 2.2 and also for further comparison, we will now briefly discuss two conventional warranty policies which do not take into account operational history of items:Option 1: no preventive maintenance during the warranty period [0, W).Option 2: preventive maintenance at time T during [0, W).Let us define first the expected warranty servicing costs during the warranty period [0, W). These quantities are obviously given for Option 1 and Option 2 as(4)C0≡cmE[N(W)]and(5)C1(T)≡cmE[N(T)]+cPM+cmE[NPM(W−T)],respectively, where, N(t) is the number of minimal repairs of a new item in (0, t] andNPM(W−T)is the number of minimal repairs of an item in (T, W] after performing the PM. Specifically, in our heterogeneous setting, if the selected item is from the weak subpopulation, then it follows from the properties of minimal repair (see, e.g., Finkelstein, 2008) that the conditional expectation of the number of minimal repairs isE[N(t)|Z=1]=∫0tλ1(u)du, whereas, if it is from the strong subpopulation, thenE[N(t)|Z=2]=∫0tλ2(u)du. Therefore, for Option 1 and Option 2, the corresponding warranty costs in (4) and (5) should be specified, respectively, as(6)C0=cm[π1∫0Wλ1(u)du+π2∫0Wλ2(u)du]and(7)C1(T)≡π1cm[∫0Tλ1(u)du+∫0W−Tλ1PM(u)du]+π2cm[∫0Tλ2(u)du+∫0W−Tλ2PM(u)du]+cPM,whereλiPM(t),i=1,2are the failure rates after time t from the moment of the PM action.We should emphasize here that the minimal repair to be applied in this case is the ‘minimal repair at the subpopulation level’ associated with λi(t) and not with λm(t). Accordingly, if it was an item from the strong (weak) subpopulation before the failure, then after minimal repair, it also remains strong (weak). This kind of minimal repair can be considered as the ‘information-based minimal repair’ (See Aven & Jensen, 1999, 2000; Finkelstein, 1992; Cha & Finkelstein, 2011; Finkelstein & Cha, 2013). In the real world, this type of information-based minimal repair is more realistic (see, e.g., Boland & El-Neweihi, 1998) and, therefore, hereafter we will assume it for the items from the mixed population.In the previous subsection, we have considered conventional warranty policies incorporating PM actions. However, as operational (reliability) characteristics of items from different subpopulations are different, the preventive maintenance strategy under warranty should be also different depending on the subpopulation from which the item in operation has been selected. For instance, assume that our item is from the weak population. Then using standard methods and under relevant assumptions (Biedenweg, 1981; Nguyen & Murthy, 1986; Murthy & Nguyen, 1988) the optimal (cost-wise) PM time can be obtained. However, when reliability characteristics of an item selected from a strong subpopulation are sufficiently high and the PM is costly, it would be cost-efficient not to apply PM for strong items during the warranty period. Thus, a new approach should be developed in order to obtain the optimal PM for an item that is picked out at random from the mixed population. Under this perspective, we attempt to consider and utilize the operational history of the repairable item for establishing a more adequate PM policy under warranty.Let H[0, t] be the operational history in [0, t] (i.e., {N(s), 0 ≤ s ≤ t}) and h[0, t] be the realization of the corresponding history, where N(s) is the number of failures by time s. Observe that H[0, t] can be completely defined in terms of N(t) and the sequential arrival failure points 0 ≤ S1 ≤ S2 ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ SN(t) ≤ t in [0, t], where Siis the ith failure time in [0, t], i.e., H[0, t] ≡ (N(t), S1, S2, ..., SN(t)). We are now ready to define the information-based warranty policy.• Information-based warranty policyA new item is randomly chosen from the mixed population consisting of two subpopulations and is operated under the warranty. During the warranty period [0, W], the item is minimally repaired on each failure. Observing the failures (history) during [0, T], and using the corresponding likelihoods, the item is classified as, e.g., being ‘strong’ (Z=2) at time T as follows.For a fixed 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1, define a set of histories(8)Hγ≡{h[0,T]|P(Z=2|H[0,T]=h[0,T])≥γ}.Thus, the set Hγcontains all realizations, for which the corresponding conditional probability that the selected item is strong is larger than the threshold γ.LetH[0,T]′be the history in [0, T] of the operating and minimally repaired (on failures) item andh[0,T]′be the corresponding realization. Then, givenH[0,T]′=h[0,T]′, the PM policy under warranty can now be defined as follows(a)Ifh[0,T]′∈Hγ, the item operates further and any failure in the interval [T, W] is always minimally repaired.Otherwise, at the time T the item is preventively maintained and any subsequent failures in interval [T, W] are minimally repaired.Thus, the described PM policy under warranty means that: if the likelihood that the item was selected from the ‘strong subpopulation’ is larger than the threshold level γ, then the PM action is not performed at time T and the item operates during the remainder of the warranty period [T, W]. On the other hand, if this likelihood is smaller than γ then the PM action is carried out at time T and the item operates during the remainder of the warranty period [T, W]. Thus, the intention of this policy is that the PM is not performed for the item from the strong population. The decision process for the information-based warranty policy is illustrated in Fig. 1.Remark 1(i) The information-based warranty policy described above can be equivalently represented in the following form:For a fixed 0 ≤ η ≤ 1, whereη≡1−γ, define a set of historiesUη≡{h[0,T]|P(Z=1|H[0,T]=h[0,T])≥η}.Then, givenH[0,T]′=h[0,T]′, the following PM policy under warranty is applied :(a)Ifh[0,T]′∈Uη, at the time T the item is preventively maintained and any subsequent failures in interval [T, W] are minimally repaired.Otherwise, the item is further operated and any failure in the interval [T, W] is always minimally repaired.(ii) The case whenγ=0in our proposed warranty policy corresponds to Option 1 where all failures experienced by the item during the warranty period are only minimally repaired without the PM action, whereas, the case whenγ=1agrees with Option 2 where all the items preventively maintained at time T within the warranty period. Thus (4) and (5) could be regarded as special cases of the information-based warranty policy.The information-based warranty policy defined above is completely characterized by a set of two parameters (γ, T). We will now derive the corresponding expected warranty cost function denoted by C(γ, T) and consider obtaining the optimal set of parameters which minimizes the warranty cost function under the information-based warranty policy. It is important to note that along with the obvious goal to optimize T, which is a main parameter for optimization of our model, in the process of doing so, we are also optimizing the classification threshold γ. This in some way reflects the history of failures and survival of a component. For a convenient description, we need to define some additional notation here. Note that the elements in Hγare vectors (with different dimensions) having the format (n, s1, s2, ..., sn). Then Hγcan be formally expressed asHγ=⋃n=0∞Hn, where Hnis the set of elements (n, s1, s2, ..., sn) satisfying (n, s1, s2, ..., sn) ∈ Hγ‘when the first component in the vector is fixed as n’. Define alsoHnCas the set of elements (n, s1, s2, ..., sn) satisfying (n, s1, s2, ..., sn)∉Hγ‘when the first component in the vector is fixed as n’. In addition, we defineHγC≡⋃n=0∞HnC, which is the set of all histories that corresponds to the execution of the PM at the age T. Furthermore, for n ≥ 1,Hn−andHnC−are defined by(9)Hn−={(s1,s2,...,sn)|(n,s1,s2,...,sn)∈Hn},and(10)HnC−={(s1,s2,...,sn)|(n,s1,s2,...,sn)∈HnC},respectively. Thus, the setsHn−andHnC−in (9) and (10) contain elements of HnandHnCbut dropping the first component n in (n, s1, s2, ..., sn), respectively.In the following, we characterize the set Hnand, using this characterization, provide the corresponding expected warranty cost to be optimized later. Although the relevant formulas seem to be cumbersome, they have a clear probabilistic meaning and will be significantly simplified in the specific and practically important case to follow.First, we will characterize the set Hn. Note that the joint distribution of events in the historyh[0,T]=(n,s1,s2,...,sn)for subpopulation i (givenZ=i) (which, in fact, is the corresponding likelihood of occurrences of events in the nonhomogeneous Poisson process with rate λi(t) at time instants s1 < s2 < ... < sn) is, obviously,λi(s1)exp{−∫0s1λi(u)du}·λi(s2)exp{−∫s1s2λi(u)du}×⋯×λi(sn)exp{−∫sn−1snλi(u)du}·exp{−∫snTλi(u)du}=∏j=1nλi(sj)·exp{−∫0Tλi(u)du},where∏j=1n(·)≡1, forn=0,i=1,2. Then, taking into account the structure of our mixed population (1)–(2), the conditional probability of the event(Z=2|H[0,T]=h[0,T])is given byP(Z=2|H[0,T]=h[0,T])=π2∏j=1nλ2(sj)·exp{−∫0Tλ2(u)du}π1∏j=1nλ1(sj)·exp{−∫0Tλ1(u)du}+π2∏j=1nλ2(sj)·exp{−∫0Tλ2(u)du},Therefore, the inequalityP(Z=2|H[0,T]=h[0,T])≥γcan be equivalently expressed as∏j=1nλ1(sj)λ2(sj)·exp{−∫0T(λ1(u)−λ2(u))du}≤π2π11−γγ,which now characterizes the set Hn, n ≥ 1. In a similar way, forn=0, taking into account the convention∏j=10(·)≡1, we haveexp{−∫0T(λ1(u)−λ2(u))du}≤π2π11−γγ.Now we derive the expected warranty cost function. Recalling definitions of Hγ(and HγC) in (8), respectively, define the relevant set of joint probabilities for further derivations as(11)α1(γ,T)≡P(Z=1,H[0,T]′∈HγC),α2(γ,T)≡P(Z=2,H[0,T]′∈HγC),(12)β1(γ,T)≡P(Z=1,H[0,T]′∈Hγ),β2(γ,T)≡P(Z=2,H[0,T]′∈Hγ),where α1(γ, T) (α2(γ, T)) is the probability that the item is from the weak (strong) subpopulation and that the PM will be performed at T, and β1(γ, T) (β2(γ, T)) is the probability that the item is from the weak (strong) subpopulation and that the PM will not be performed at T, respectively. Consider the following conditional probabilityP(H′[0,T]∈HγC|Z=i)=∑n=0∞P(H′[0,T]∈HγC,N(T)′=n|Z=i)=exp{−∫0Tλi(u)du}·I(exp{−∫0T(λ1(u)−λ2(u))du}>π2π11−γγ)+∑n=1∞∫⋯∫(s1,s2,...,sn)∈HnC−∏j=1nλi(sj)·exp{−∫0Tλi(u)du}ds1ds2⋯dsn,i=1,2,where N(T)′ agrees with the first component in the historyH[0,T]′of the item in the operation and I( · ) is the corresponding indicator. That is,I(C)=1if the condition C is satisfied; otherwiseI(C)=0. Note that the first term corresponds toP(H[0,T]′∈HγC,N(T)′=0|Z=i),which is the conditional joint probability that there were no failures in (0, t] and that this event belongs to HγC, givenZ=i. The second term corresponds to the sum of the conditional joint probabilities that there weren=1,2,...failures in (0, t] and that this event belongs to HγC, givenZ=i,n=1,2,....Therefore, asP(Z=i)=πiin our mixture model, αi(γ, T) in (11) is given byαi(γ,T)=πi[exp{−∫0Tλi(u)du}·I(exp{−∫0T(λ1(u)−λ2(u))du}>π2π11−γγ)+∑n=1∞∫⋯∫(s1,s2,...,sn)∈HnC−∏j=1nλi(sj)·exp{−∫0Tλi(u)du}ds1ds2⋯dsn],fori=1,2,and in a similar way βi(γ, T) in (12) is obtained asβi(γ,T)=πi[exp{−∫0Tλi(u)du}·I(exp{−∫0T(λ1(u)−λ2(u))du}≤π2π11−γγ)+∑n=1∞∫⋯∫(s1,s2,...,sn)∈Hn−∏j=1nλi(sj)·exp{−∫0Tλi(u)du}ds1ds2⋯dsn],fori=1,2.Note that the decision at time T results in the following four mutually exclusive cases:Case 1:{Z=1,H[0,T]′∈HγC}, Case 2:{Z=2,H[0,T]′∈HγC},Case 3:{Z=1,H[0,T]′∈Hγ}, Case 4:{Z=2,H[0,T]′∈Hγ},which obviously correspond to:∑i=12(αi(γ,T)+βi(γ,T))=1.The expected cost functions that correspond to each of the above cases are given as follows:Case 1:cm[Λ1(T)+Λ1PM(W−T)]+cPM, Case 2:cm[Λ2(T)+Λ2PM(W−T)]+cPM,Case 3: cmΛ1(W), Case 4: cmΛ2(W),whereΛi(t)≡∫0tλi(u)du,i=1,2,ΛiPM(t)≡∫0tλiPM(u)du,i=1,2.Therefore, accordingly, we have the following expected warranty cost functionC(γ,T)=∑i=12αi(γ,T){cm[Λi(T)+ΛiPM(W−T)]+cPM}+∑i=12βi(γ,T){cmΛi(W)}.Thus, we have the following proposition.Proposition 1(i)The set Hnis characterized as follows:For the fixed n ≥ 1, the set Hnconsists of elements (n, s1, s2, ..., sn) satisfying the condition∏j=1nλ1(sj)λ2(sj)·exp{−∫0T(λ1(u)−λ2(u))du}≤π2π11−γγ.whenn=0, the corresponding element (n=0) belongs to H0 if it satisfies the following conditionexp{−∫0T(λ1(u)−λ2(u))du}≤π2π11−γγ,and H0 is an empty set, otherwise.(ii)The expected warranty servicing cost function in [0, W] is given by(13)C(γ,T)=∑i=12αi(γ,T){cm[Λi(T)+ΛiPM(W−T)]+cPM}+∑i=12βi(γ,T){cmΛi(W)}Until now, we have discussed the information-based warranty for repairable items under a general setting with condition (3) defining strong and weak subpopulations. Therefore, our Proposition 1 is rather general. In view of possible applications, let us consider a specific but practically very important model describing these subpopulations. Suppose that the subpopulation's failure rates are proportional:(14)λ1(t)=φλ2(t),t≥0,where φ > 1, which is generally called the ‘proportional hazards model’ (Finkelstein, 2008) or the ‘relative risk model’ (Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 2002). This model can be meaningfully applied in practice for subpopulations (see, e.g., Leemis, 1995; Ebeling, 1997). For example, the use of bad (or defective) material in manufacturing items may double its failure rate compared with that of the normal (baseline) subpopulation.Under the assumption (14), Proposition 1 can be significantly simplified as follows in Proposition 2. As process of minimal repairs for the strong (weak) items follows the NHPP with the corresponding rate, Proposition 2 easily follows from Proposition 1 in a straightforward way.Proposition 2Suppose thatλ1(t)=φλ2(t),t≥0, where φ > 1.(i)Then the set Hγis characterized as the following set of nonnegative integersN={n:n≤1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γγ)+(φ−1)∫0Tλ2(u)du)}.Letn(γ,T)≡⌊1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γγ)+(φ−1)∫0Tλ2(u)du)⌋,Then the expected warranty cost function C(γ, T) is given by (13), where ifN=φthenαi(γ,T)=πi,i=1,2,andβi(γ,T)=0,i=1,2;otherwiseαi(γ,T)=πi(1−∑n=0n(γ,T)(Λi(T))nn!exp{−Λi(T)}),i=1,2andβi(γ,T)=πi∑n=0n(γ,T)(Λi(T))nn!exp{−Λi(T)},i=1,2.We will now formulate the problem of finding the optimal information-based warranty policy (γ*, T*) under a general setting, i.e.,C(γ*,T*)=min0≤γ≤1,0<T<WC(γ,T).As mentioned before, the warranty costs in the cases whenγ=0andγ=1agree with those in (4) and (5), respectively. Therefore, we have(15)C(γ*,T*)=min0≤γ≤1,0<T<WC(γ,T)≤C(1,T1*)=C(T1*)=minT>0C1(T),and(16)C(γ*,T*)=min0≤γ≤1,0<T<WC(γ,T)≤C0.From inequalities in (15) and (16), it can be concluded that the information based warranty policy is better than the ordinary warranty policies. In general, it is not surprising, as we utilize additional information on the history of failures and survival.Optimization can be performed by the two-stage procedure. At the first stage, fixing γ ∈ [0, 1], we find optimal T*(γ) ∈ [0, W) that satisfiesC(γ,T*(γ))=min0≤T(γ)<WC(γ,T(γ)).At the second stage, we determine γ* such thatC(γ*,T*(γ*))=minγ∈[0,1]C(γ,T*(γ)).In the numerical examples in Section 4, these two stages will be executed by using the grid search method. As was mentioned before, T is the main controllable parameter, whereas the classification threshold γ is an additional ‘tuning’ parameter reflecting the history of failures and survival. But first, we want to present a practically important generalization of the approach developed in the current section.In the previous section, we have (implicitly) assumed that reliability characteristics of ‘strong’ items are sufficiently high whereas the PM is quite costly and thus the PM for these items is not cost-effective. However, it is not always the case in practice. Therefore, in this section, we consider the generalized warranty policy (under the proportional hazards model defined in (14)) that accounts for the possibility of PM during the warranty period for strong items as well. Thus, we now assume that the items classified as weak are preventively maintained at V1 ∈ [0, W) and those classified as strong are preventively maintained at V2 ∈ [0, W). First, we consider the case when V1 ≤ V2 (the other case can also be considered symmetrically).• Generalized information-based warranty policy (imperfect PM)For a fixed 0 < γ < 1, define a set of historiesHγ≡{h[0,V1]|P(Z=2|H[0,V1]=h[0,V1])≥γ}.(a)Ifh[0,V1]′∉Hγ, at the time V1 the item is preventively maintained and any subsequent failures in interval [V1, W] are minimally repaired.Ifh[0,V1]′∈Hγ, the item operates further and at the time V2 the item is preventively maintained and any subsequent failures in interval [V2, W] are minimally repaired.Note that the cases whenγ=0orγ=1correspond to the special case in (7) and we exclude these cases in this section. Assume that the failure rate function after the PM action is given byλ1iPM(t)=λi(θV1+t),0<θ<1,i=1,2,λ2iPM(t)=λi(θV2+t),0<θ<1,i=1,2.This imperfect PM model is based on the concept of virtual age Model 1 introduced by Kijima (1989) (see also Finkelstein (2008)). Parameter θ < 1 defines the decrease in virtual age after the PM. In this case, the expected warranty cost as the function of (γ, V1, V2) is given byC(γ,V1,V2)=∑i=12αi(γ,V1){cm[Λi(V1)+Λ1iPM(W−V1)]+cPM}+∑i=12βi(γ,V1){cm[Λi(V2)+Λ2iPM(W−V2)]+cPM},whereΛ1iPM(t)≡∫0tλi(θV1+u)du,i=1,2,Λ2iPM(t)≡∫0tλi(θV2+u)du,i=1,2. We will now consider obtaining the optimal(γ*,V1*,V2*)which minimizes C(γ, V1, V2).Proposition 3Suppose that λi(t) is IFR and λi″(t) ≥ 0, for all t ≥ 0,i=1,2. Let U* be the unique value minimizingcm[Λ1(T)+∫0W−Tλ1(θT+u)du].The proof of Proposition 3 is given in Appendix 1. The case when V1 ≥ V2 can be symmetrically considered and the same result can be proved.Remark 2(i) Proposition 3 implies that we do not have to consider the Generalized Information-Based Warranty Policy (Imperfect PM) because the minimum cost is the same as that in the special case in (7) (Option 2). This is an important result that cannot be foreseen beforehand.(ii) The proof of Proposition 3 also implies that the optimal T* minimizing C1(T) in (7) is the unique value U* minimizingcm[Λ1(T)+∫0W−Tλ1(θT+u)du],for any π1 and π2.• Generalized information-based warranty policy (perfect PM)Let us consider now the generalized warranty policy when PM at V1 and V2 is perfect. The expected warranty cost in this case isC(γ,V1,V2)=∑i=12αi(γ,V1){cm[Λi(V1)+∑j=12πjΛj(W−V1)]+cPM}+∑i=12βi(γ,V1){cm[Λi(V2)+∑j=12πjΛj(W−V2)]+cPM}.The optimal(γ*,V1*,V2*), which minimizes C(γ, V1, V2) has now different properties than those for the case of imperfect PM. It turns out that the optimal(γ*,V1*,V2*)withV1*≠V2*, can exist now, as will be illustrated in Example 3 in the next section.In this section, several numerical examples which illustrate the application of the proposed warranty policy will be given. For the sake of comparison, we assume in all examples that the failure rate functions are given by the following Weibull failure rates:λ1(t)=4t2(weak subpopulation) andλ2(t)=t2(strong subpopulation), t ≥ 0, unless otherwise specified. Then this setting corresponds to the model given in (14) withφ=4.Example 1 (Perfect PM)Consider the case when the perfect PM (i.e. the item is replaced by a new one which is selected from the heterogeneous population) is carried out under the proposed warranty policy. In this case,λiPM(t)=∑j=12πjλj(t),i=1,2in Proposition 1 and then the corresponding expected warranty servicing cost function can be written asC(γ,T)=∑i=12αi(γ,T){cm[Λi(T)+∑i=12πiΛi(W−T)]+cPM}+∑i=12βi(γ,T){cmΛi(W)},For solving the corresponding optimization problem by obtaining the optimal parameter set (γ*, T*), we employ the two-stage procedure of the previous section. At the first stage, we discretize the region (0, 1) with equal step 0.1 (note thatγ=0andγ=1corresponds to C0 and C1(T), and they will be considered separately), and then, fixingγ=0.1,0.2,...,0.9, we find optimal T*(γ) that satisfiesC(γ,T*(γ))=minT(γ)∈{0.1,0.2,...,5}C(γ,T(γ)).At this stage, for each value ofγ=0.1,0.2,...,0.9, the optimal T*(γ) was obtained. At the second stage, we determine γ* such thatC(γ*,T*(γ*))=minγ∈{0.1,0.2,...,0.9}C(γ,T*(γ)).Following the above grid search method, we were able to obtain the optimal parameter set (γ*, T*). Furthermore, the results were verified by using the ‘optim’ procedure in R. As we know, C0 in (6) and the optimal T1* and C1(T1*) in (7) can be obtained by fixingγ=0andγ=1, respectively. We have performed calculations for different values of π1 and π2 and the corresponding numerical results are provided in Table 1. For instance, whenπ1=0.2,π2=0.8, the optimal γ* and T* are given by 0.8–0.9 and 2.3 and the corresponding warranty cost C(γ*, T*) is given by 4.9449. As can be seen from Table 1, when the probability that the item is selected from the weak population (i.e., π1) increases, the warranty cost also increases, which is natural. Furthermore, as can be expected, it is shown that C(γ*, T*) is smaller than both C1(T1*) obtained via the conventional optimization using (7) and C0 in (6) for each π1 and π2. This indicates that the information-based warranty policy is more cost-effective than the conventional policies (6) and (7). Note that C1(T) is given byC1(T)≡π1cm[∫0Tλ1(t)dt+∫0W−T∑j=12πjλj(t)dt]+π2cm[∫0Tλ2(t)dt+∫0W−T∑j=12πjλj(t)dt]+cPM=π1cm[∫0Tλ1(t)dt+∫0W−Tλ1(t)dt]+π2cm[∫0Tλ2(t)dt+∫0W−Tλ2(t)dt]+cPM,and, when λi(t) is strictly increasing, both∫0Tλi(t)dt+∫0W−Tλi(t)dt,i=1,2,are minimized whenT=W/2, for any values of π1 and π2. Thus, we haveT1*=2.5for any values of π1 and π2.However, when the replacement cost is too large, the proposed information-based warranty policy (with perfect PM) may not be effective as illustrated in the following. In this case, the less expensive ‘imperfect PM’ can be considered as an alternative (see Example 2).Letcm=0.1,cPM=15andW=5. For illustration of the above statement, we set the cost of PM to be much larger than that considered previously. In order to find (γ*, T*), we utilize the same two-stage procedure. Then, for instance, whenπ1=0.2,π2=0.8, the optimal γ* is given by 0 which indicates that the there is no need to perform the replacement action even for weak items under the warranty policy. This means that, in this case, the warranty model in Option 1 is better than the proposed information-based warranty policy.The next example illustrates the case of imperfect PM.Example 2 (Imperfect PM)Assume that the failure rate function after the PM action is given byλiPM(t)=λi(θT+t),0<θ<1,i=1,2. As our results in Proposition 2 are not limited to the specific type of PM, the expected warranty servicing cost can be computed using αi(γ, T) and βi(γ, T),i=1,2,given in Proposition 2. Letcm=0.1,cPM=3,θ=0.5, andW=5, whereas the failure rates for the weak and strong items are the same as in Example 1.In order to obtain optimal (γ*, T*), we follow the two stage procedure similar to that in Example 1. Accordingly, the results corresponding to different values of π1 and π2 are provided in Table 2. For instance, whenπ1=0.2,π2=0.8, the optimal γ* and T* are given by 0.8 ≤ γ* ≤ 0.9 andT*=2.8and the corresponding warranty cost C(γ*, T*) is given by 5.6955. As can be seen in Table 2, the proportion of week population in the population increases (i.e., π1 increases), the warranty cost increases. Furthermore, it is obvious that C(γ*, T*) is smaller than both C1(T1*) in (7) and C0 in (6) for each π1 and π2, which indicates that the information-based imperfect warranty policy is more cost-effective. Note that, due to Remark 2-(ii), T1* is the same for different values of π1 and π2. Furthermore, the minimum cost of the Generalized Information-Based Warranty Policy (Imperfect PM) in Section 3 is the same as C1(T1*) for each case (see Proposition 3 and Remark 2 in Section 3).Note that the age reduction factor θ that reflects the improvement in the item's reliability after the PM can at some instances be considered as a decision variable. In this case, clearly, the cost of PM, denoted by cPM(θ), increases as θ decreases. Furthermore, asθ=0andθ=1correspond to the perfect and minimal repairs, respectively, it would be reasonable for cPM(θ) to satisfycPM(0)=crandcPM(1)=cm, where cris the cost for a replacement. Taking these considerations into account, assume that cPM(θ) is specified ascPM(θ)=cr+θρ(cm−cr), where ρ > 0. As(cm−cr)<0, cPM(θ) is decreasing in θ. Furthermore, cPM(θ) is increasing in ρ > 0 because(cm−cr)<0. The expected warranty cost as a function of (θ, γ, T) is given byC(θ,γ,T)=∑i=12αi(γ,T){cm[Λi(T)+ΛiPM(W−T)]+cPM(θ)}+∑i=12βi(γ,T){cmΛi(W)},whereλiPM(t)=λi(θT+t),0<θ<1,i=1,2. Consider the case whenπ1=0.2,π2=0.8,cm=0.1andcr=10. Under this setting the optimal warranty policy (θ*, γ*, T*) has been obtained for different values of ρ > 0 (see Table 3).It can be observed that as the cost of PM becomes large (i.e., as ρ increases), less items are preventively maintained (γ*is decreasing) and θ* increases to reduce the expected warranty cost, which is intuitively clear.Example 3 (Generalized information-based warranty policy (perfect PM))For the setting of Example 1, whenπ1=0.2,π2=0.8, let us apply now the Generalized Information-Based Warranty Policy with perfect PM. In this case, the optimal(γ*,V1*,V2*)which minimizes C(γ, V1, V2) has been obtained as follows: 0.8 ≤ γ* ≤ 0.9,V1*=2.1,V2*=2.8withC(γ*,V1*,V2*)=6.5635. Therefore, we can see that this policy is better than Options 1 and 2, but worse than the information-based warranty policy considered in Example 1. Thus, in this case, there is no need for the perfect PM for the items classified as strong.The failure rate of the strong items above was specified asλ2(t)=t2. What happens if it is larger and the difference with the failure rate of the strong items is smaller than in Example 1? Consider the following setting:λ1(t)=5t2andλ2(t)=2.5t2, t ≥ 0. The other parameters are the same as those in Example 1. In this case, our procedure gives the following results:C0=12.500for Option 1;T1*=2.5withC1(T1*)=8.1250for Option 2; andγ*=1.0,T*=2.5withC(γ*,T*)=8.1250for the information-based warranty policy considered in Example 1. On the other hand, for the Generalized Information-Based Warranty Policy with perfect PM we have:γ*=0.7,V1*=2.3,V2*=2.6andC(γ*,V1*,V2*)=8.0916. Therefore, in this case, the Generalized Information-Based Warranty Policy with perfect PM is the most cost-effective policy. From the above illustration, we can see that if the failure rate of the strong subpopulation is sufficiently small and the difference between the failure rates of the strong and weak subpopulations is large, there is no need to apply the Generalized Information-Based Warranty Policy with the perfect PM. In this case, the PM should be performed only for weak items and the Information-Based Warranty Policy considered in Section 2 should be applied. However, when the failure rate of the strong subpopulation is relatively large and the difference between the failure rates of the strong and weak subpopulations is not so large, the Generalized Information-Based Warranty Policy with the perfect PM is more cost effective because, in this case, the expected warranty cost can be further reduced not only by replacing weak items but also by replacing strong ones.In practice, most often, PM performed once during warranty period because the length of warranty period is relatively short compared with the whole lifetime (see, e.g., Chien, 2008; Yeh, Chen, & Lin, 2007; Yeh et al., 2015). However, at some instances, PM could be performed more than once. In this section, we consider the case when PM (imperfect and perfect) is performed twice at T1 and T2 in [0, W), where 0 < T1 < T2 < W. Our main focus here is to outline the corresponding methodology that can be used in applications in the future research. We will see that even the case of two PM actions (N=2) is more complex than that considered in the previous sections. In principle, the developed methodology could be generalized to the case of N > 2 PMs, however, although probabilistically this generalization is rather straightforward, it will need specific computational tools to be implemented in practice.The case of imperfect PMIn this section, we will consider the case of Imperfect PM and that of Perfect PM is deferred to Appendix 2.• Information-based warranty policyA new item is randomly chosen from the mixed population consisting of two subpopulations and is operated under the warranty. During the warranty period [0, W], the item is minimally repaired on each failure.(i)PM atT1Observing the failures (history) during [0, T1], and using the corresponding likelihoods, the item is classified as, e.g., being ‘strong’ (Z=2) as follows at T1. For a fixed 0 ≤ γ1 ≤ 1, define a set of historiesHγ1≡{h[0,T1]|P(Z=2|H[0,T1]=h[0,T1])≥γ1}.LetH[0,T1]′be the history in [0, T1] of the operating and minimally repaired (on failures) item andh[0,T1]′be the corresponding realization. Then, givenH[0,T1]′=h[0,T1]′, the PM policy under warranty can now be defined as follows(a)Ifh[0,T1]′∈Hγ1, the item operates further until T2 and any failure in the interval [T1, T2] is always minimally repaired.Otherwise, at the time T1 the item is preventively maintained and any subsequent failures in interval [T1, T2] are minimally repaired.(ii)PM atT2Observing the failures (history) during [T1, T2] and combining the previous history during [0, T1], and using the corresponding likelihoods, the item is classified as, e.g., being ‘strong’ (Z=2) as follows at T2. For a fixed 0 ≤ γ2 ≤ 1, define a set of historiesHγ2≡{h[0,T2]|P(Z=2|H[0,T2]=h[0,T2])≥γ2}.LetH[0,T2]′be the history in [0, T2] of the operating and minimally repaired (on failures) item andh[0,T2]′be the corresponding realization. Then, givenH[0,T2]′=h[0,T2]′, the PM policy under warranty can now be defined as follows(a)Ifh[0,T2]′∈Hγ2, the item operates further until W and any failure in the interval [T2, W) is always minimally repaired.Otherwise, at the time T2 the item is preventively maintained and any subsequent failures in interval [T2, W) are minimally repaired.We will now derive the expected warranty cost C(γ1, T1; γ2, T2) under the proportional hazards model (14). First, let us consider the imperfect PM which follows the Kjima's virtual age Model 1, as previously. As before, the inequalityP(Z=2|H[0,T1]=h[0,T1])≥γ1can be equivalently expressed as∏j=1n1λ1(s1j)λ2(s1j)·exp{−∫0T1(λ1(u)−λ2(u))du}≤π2π11−γ1γ1,where, n1 is the realization of N(T1) and s1j,j=1,2,...,n1, are the realizations of the corresponding sequential failure times. Then, under the proportional hazards model (14), as before,Hγ1is characterized as the following set of nonnegative integersN1={n1:n1≤1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γ1γ1)+(φ−1)∫0T1λ2(u)du)}.On the other hand, the inequalityP(Z=2|H[0,T2]=h[0,T2])≥γ2can be expressed differently depending on whether the PM was performed at T1 for the item in operation or not.[Case (a): PM was performed atT1]ThenP(Z=2|H[0,T2]=h[0,T2])=(π2∏j=1n1λ2(s1j)·exp{−∫0T1λ2(u)du}×∏j=1n2λ2(θT1+(s2j−T1))·exp{−∫θT1θT1+(T2−T1)λ2(u)du})×(π1∏j=1n1λ1(s1j)·exp{−∫0T1λ1(u)du}×∏j=1n2λ1(θT1+(s2j−T1))·exp{−∫θT1θT1+(T2−T1)λ1(u)du}+π2∏j=1n1λ2(s1j)·exp{−∫0T1λ2(u)du}×∏j=1n2λ2(θT1+(s2j−T1))·exp{−∫θT1θT1+(T2−T1)λ2(u)du})−1,where n2 is the realization ofN(T2)−N(T1)and s2j,j=1,2,...,n2, are the realizations of the corresponding sequential failure points in the interval [T1, T2]. Then, under the proportional hazards model in (14),P(Z=2|H[0,T2]=h[0,T2])≥γ2is equivalent ton1+n2≤1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γ2γ2)+(φ−1)[∫0T1λ2(u)du+∫θT1θT1+(T2−T1)λ2(u)du]).Thus, the decision on whether to perform PM or not is made based onn1+n2and, thus, the setHγ2is characterized as the following set of nonnegative integersN2={n1+n2:n1+n2≤1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γ2γ2)+(φ−1)[∫0T1λ2(u)du+∫θT1θT1+(T2−T1)λ2(u)du])}.[Case (b): PM was not performed atT1]ThenP(Z=2|H[0,T2]=h[0,T2])=(π2∏j=1n1λ2(s1j)·exp{−∫0T1λ2(u)du}×∏j=1n2λ2(s2j)·exp{−∫T1T2λ2(u)du})×(π1∏j=1n1λ1(s1j)·exp{−∫0T1λ1(u)du}×∏j=1n2λ1(s2j))·exp{−∫T1T2λ1(u)du}+π2∏j=1n1λ2(s1j)·exp{−∫0T1λ2(u)du}×∏j=1n2λ2(s2j)·exp{−∫T1T2λ2(u)du})−1.Under the proportional hazards model (14),P(Z=2|H[0,T2]=h[0,T2])≥γ2is equivalent ton1+n2≤1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γ2γ2)+(φ−1)∫0T2λ2(u)du).Thus, at T2, the decision on whether to perform PM or not is made based onn1+n2and, accordingly, the setHγ2is characterized as the following set of nonnegative integersN2={n1+n2:n1+n2≤1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γ2γ2)+(φ−1)∫0T2λ2(u)du)}.Definen1(γ1,T1)≡⌊1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γ1γ1)+(φ−1)∫0T1λ2(u)du)⌋,n21(γ2,T1,T2)≡⌊1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γ2γ2)+(φ−1)[∫0T1λ2(u)du+∫θT1θT1+(T2−T1)λ2(u)du])⌋,n22(γ2,T2)≡⌊1lnφ(ln(π2π11−γ2γ2)+(φ−1)∫0T2λ2(u)du)⌋.We are now ready to derive the expected warranty cost C(γ1, T1; γ2, T2). Observe that we have the following eight different scenarios:Case 1:{Z=1,H[0,T1]′∈Hγ1C,H[0,T2]′∈Hγ2C},Case 2:{Z=2,H[0,T1]′∈Hγ1C,H[0,T2]′∈Hγ2C},Case 3:{Z=1,H[0,T1]′∈Hγ1C,H[0,T2]′∈Hγ2},Case 4:{Z=2,H[0,T1]′∈Hγ1C,H[0,T2]′∈Hγ2},Case 5:{Z=1,H[0,T1]′∈Hγ1,H[0,T2]′∈Hγ2C},Case 6:{Z=2,H[0,T1]′∈Hγ1,H[0,T2]′∈Hγ2C},Case 7:{Z=1,H[0,T1]′∈Hγ1,H[0,T2]′∈Hγ2},Case 8:{Z=2,H[0,T1]′∈Hγ1,H[0,T2]′∈Hγ2}.The expected cost functions that correspond to each of the above cases are given as follows:Case 1:c(1)≡cm[∫0T1λ1(u)du+∫0T2−T1λ1(θT1+u)du+∫0W−T2λ1(θT2+u)du]+2cPM,Case 2:c(2)≡cm[∫0T1λ2(u)du+∫0T2−T1λ2(θT1+u)du+∫0W−T2λ2(θT2+u)du]+2cPM,Case 3:c(3)≡cm[∫0T1λ1(u)du+∫0T2−T1λ1(θT1+u)du+∫0W−T2λ1(θT1+(T2−T1)+u)du]+cPM,Case 4:c(4)≡cm[∫0T1λ2(u)du+∫0T2−T1λ2(θT1+u)du+∫0W−T2λ2(θT1+(T2−T1)+u)du]+cPM,Case 5:c(5)≡cm[∫0T1λ1(u)du+∫0T2−T1λ1(T1+u)du+∫0W−T2λ1(T1+θ(T2−T1)+u)du]+cPM,Case 6:c(6)≡cm[∫0T1λ2(u)du+∫0T2−T1λ2(T1+u)du+∫0W−T2λ2(T1+θ(T2−T1)+u)du]+cPM,Case 7:c(7)≡cm[∫0T1λ1(u)du+∫0T2−T1λ1(T1+u)du+∫0W−T2λ1(T2+u)du],Case 8:c(8)≡cm[∫0T1λ2(u)du+∫0T2−T1λ2(T1+u)du+∫0W−T2λ2(T2+u)du].Furthermore, the corresponding probabilities for the eight cases are given byp(1)≡P(Z=1,H′[0,T1]∈Hγ1C,H′[0,T2]∈Hγ2C)=π1P(N1[0,T1]>n1(γ1,T1),N1[0,T1]+N1[T1,T2]C>n21(γ2,T1,T2)),p(2)≡P(Z=2,H′[0,T1]∈Hγ1C,H′[0,T2]∈Hγ2C)=π2P(N2[0,T1]>n1(γ1,T1),N2[0,T1]+N2[T1,T2]C>n21(γ2,T1,T2)),p(3)≡P(Z=1,H′[0,T1]∈Hγ1C,H′[0,T2]∈Hγ2)=π1P(N1[0,T1]>n1(γ1,T1),N1[0,T1]+N1[T1,T2]C≤n21(γ2,T1,T2)),p(4)≡P(Z=2,H′[0,T1]∈Hγ1C,H′[0,T2]∈Hγ2)=π2P(N2[0,T1]>n1(γ1,T1),N2[0,T1]+N2[T1,T2]C≤n21(γ2,T1,T2)),p(5)≡P(Z=1,H′[0,T1]∈Hγ1,H′[0,T2]∈Hγ2C)=π1P(N1[0,T1]≤n1(γ1,T1),N1[0,T1]+N1[T1,T2]>n22(γ2,T2)),p(6)≡P(Z=2,H′[0,T1]∈Hγ1,H′[0,T2]∈Hγ2C)=π2P(N2[0,T1]≤n1(γ1,T1),N2[0,T1]+N2[T1,T2]>n22(γ2,T2)),p(7)≡P(Z=1,H′[0,T1]∈Hγ1,H′[0,T2]∈Hγ2)=π1P(N1[0,T1]≤n1(γ1,T1),N1[0,T1]+N1[T1,T2]≤n22(γ2,T2)),p(8)≡P(Z=2,H′[0,T1]∈Hγ1,H′[0,T2]∈Hγ2)=π2P(N2[0,T1]≤n1(γ1,T1),N2[0,T1]+N2[T1,T2]≤n22(γ2,T2)),whereN1[0,T1],N2[0,T1],N1[T1,T2]C,N2[T1,T2]C,N1[T1,T2],N2[T1,T2], are independent Poisson random variables with the corresponding means∫0T1λ1(u)du,∫0T1λ2(u)du,∫0T2−T1λ1(θT1+u)du,∫0T2−T1λ2(θT1+u)du,∫0T2−T1λ1(T1+u)du,∫0T2−T1λ2(T1+u)du, respectively. Therefore, the expected warranty cost C(γ1, T1; γ2, T2) is given by(17)C(γ1,T1;γ2,T2)=∑i=18p(i)c(i).Our goal in this section was to describe the corresponding methodology of obtaining the expected warranty cost given by (17). Similar to Sections 3 and 4, the optimal warranty policy can be obtained using the ‘multistage procedure’. However, computational aspects of this approach and the corresponding procedures are out of the scope of this paper and will be considered elsewhere.The case of Perfect PM is deferred to Appendix 2.Preventive maintenance over the warranty period has an impact on the warranty servicing cost. From the manufacturer's perspective, it is worthy of carrying out this type of maintenance only if the reduction in the warranty cost exceeds the cost of preventive maintenance. Such optimal preventive maintenance over the warranty period has been thoroughly discussed and applied to the items from homogeneous populations. The goal of this paper is to perform a meaningful generalization to the case when the items are from heterogeneous populations and the PM is imperfect. As far as we know, heterogeneity was not considered in the literature with respect to warranty problems.In this paper, we assume that the item is selected from a heterogeneous population which consists of two stochastically ordered subpopulations and propose the information-based warranty policy which utilizes the operational history of the item in the field operation. It has been shown that the conventional warranty policies (Options 1 and 2) are special cases of our information-based warranty policy whenγ=0orγ=1. Thus, the proposed information-based warranty policy is more cost-effective than the conventional warranty policies. Illustrative examples have been provided and optimal warranty policy has been discussed in detail. Furthermore, it was shown that the proposed warranty policy contains the ordinary warranty polices as special cases and outperforms them.From the mathematical point of view, the proposed warranty policy utilizes the information included in the observed random point processes. This approach has not been yet discussed in the literature. We apply it in this paper only to the PM policy under warranty. However, as the proposed methodology is very general, it can be also applied to other types of maintenance policies.
