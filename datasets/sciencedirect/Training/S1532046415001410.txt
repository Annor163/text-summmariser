@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper describes the use of an agile text mining platform (Linguamatics’ Interactive Information Extraction Platform, I2E) to extract document-level cardiac risk factors in patient records as defined in the i2b2/UTHealth 2014 challenge. The approach uses a data-driven rule-based methodology with the addition of a simple supervised classifier. We demonstrate that agile text mining allows for rapid optimization of extraction strategies, while post-processing can leverage annotation guidelines, corpus statistics and logic inferred from the gold standard data. We also show how data imbalance in a training set affects performance. Evaluation of this approach on the test data gave an F-Score of 91.7%, one percent behind the top performing system.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The i2b2/UTHealth 2014 Cardiac Risk Factors Challenge [1,2] requires document-level annotations for cardiac risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure and smoking status, along with the timing of each factor relative to the document creation date.Top-performing approaches to past i2b2 challenges have often been dominated by machine learning systems or complex hybrid approaches, although rule-based systems have had some popularity depending on the nature of the task. Despite the dominance of machine learning approaches in competitions, they are still used sparingly at healthcare institutions such as Mayo Clinic [3] and Regenstrief Institute [4]. Systems trained using supervised machine-learning algorithms are often very sensitive to the distribution of data, and a model trained on clinical notes from an institution may perform poorly on those from another. For example, researchers recently reported this phenomenon for part of speech tagging [5]. Such poor performances will then be cascaded to higher-level tasks, such as this task of identifying cardiac risk factors from text. Besides the inherent challenges pertaining to the peculiar sublanguage, the difficulty in applying machine learning to clinical NLP may be attributed to the difficulty in developing a corpus annotation standard across institutions and use cases, preparing large annotated corpora conforming to a standard, and limitation of data sharing in the domain.In this work we aim to demonstrate that a competitive system is achievable by a process of interactive data-driven rule building with only marginal help from statistical methods. Data-driven rule-based text mining or “Agile Text Mining” in the form of Linguamatics’ Interactive Information Extraction Platform (I2E) has been widely used in Life Sciences for some years to extract structured data (such as protein–protein interactions relationships) [6,7] and has been more recently used in Healthcare to add structure to unstructured narratives e.g. for cohort selection or risk prediction [8].We define agile text mining as the interactive development of semantic and lexico-syntactic rules (queries) [7]. Interactive query development allows users to generalize or specialize queries and compare the results returned, in a similar fashion to refining a keyword search. This makes it suitable for one-off extraction tasks as well as common extraction tasks, such as gene-disease relationships or cancer staging. Building these rules in a data-driven manner, as we show in this paper, allows precision and recall to be balanced, while reducing the domain expertise required.The i2b2/UTHealth 2014 training set contains 790 annotated documents relating to 178 patients. See Stubbs and Uzuner [1] for a detailed summary of the risk factors and the annotation methodology. For each annotation there are two dimensions that need to be considered. The first is the type of cardiac risk factor and whether it meets certain contextual specifications. For example, a patient’s LDL level is high only if the value stated is over 100 and diabetes should only be annotated if the mention is positive rather than “the patient is not diabetic” or “he is at risk of diabetes”. The second dimension is a time attribute that describes the relationship between when the document was written and the factor being annotated, categorized into “before”, “during” and “after” the document creation time. Sometimes the risk factors occur at one point in time, for example, “the patient’s previous blood pressure was 150/90” or “patient had a myocardial infarction 10years ago”, which exhibit the “before” time attribute, and sometimes they are continuing or apply to more than one time, for example, “she continues to take metformin” or “patient is still obese”, which exhibit the “during” and “after” relations. The test set contains 514 documents from 118 patients.
