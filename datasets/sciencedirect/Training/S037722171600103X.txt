We analyze the licensing of a cost-reducing innovation in a Cournot duopoly.We focus on two-part tariff policies for both drastic and non-drastic innovations.A drastic innovation is licensed (not licensed) if cost is super-additive (sub-additive).A non drastic innovation is licensed if technology’s average gain exceeds marginal gain.Royalties are positive; fees could be zero.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We consider a Cournot duopoly under general demand and cost functions, where an incumbent patentee has a cost reducing technology that it can license to its rival by using combinations of royalties and upfront fees (two-part tariffs). We show that for drastic technologies: (a) licensing occurs and both firms stay active if the cost function is superadditive and (b) licensing does not occur and the patentee monopolizes the market if the cost function is additive or subadditive. For non drastic technologies, licensing takes place provided the average efficiency gain from the cost reducing technology is higher than the marginal gain computed at the licensee’s reservation output. Optimal licensing policies have both royalties and fees for significantly superior technologies if the cost function is superadditive. By contrast, for additive and certain subadditive cost functions, optimal licensing policies have only royalties and no fees.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A patent grants an innovator monopoly rights over an innovation for a given period of time. It seeks to provide incentives to innovate as well as to diffuse innovations. Licensing is a standard way of diffusion of innovations. Initiated by Arrow (1962), the study of different aspects of patent licensing has constituted an important area of modern industrial economics. Comparing a monopoly with a perfectly competitive industry, Arrow argued that perfect competition provides a higher incentive to innovate. Licensing in oligopolies was first studied by Kamien and Tauman (1984); 1986) and Katz and Shapiro (1985); 1986). Since then, the literature has been extended to address issues such as informational asymmetries (Choi, 2001; Gallini & Wright, 1990), product differentiation (Faulí-Oller & Sandonís, 2002; Muto, 1993), incumbent innovators (Kamien & Tauman, 2002; Marjit, 1990; Sen & Tauman, 2007; Wang, 1998) and intertemporal aspects (Avagyan, Esteban-Bravo, & Vidal-Sanz, 2014; Jensen, 1992; Saracho, 2004).In spite of its richness, the existing literature has been restrictive in regard to one important aspect of production: returns to scale. The vast majority of the papers in the literature assume that firms operate under linear cost functions.11Sen and Stamatopoulos (2009) is an exception. This paper analyzes licensing in a Cournot duopoly with an outside patentee, quadratic cost functions and linear demand.The current paper seeks to expand the literature by studying licensing between rival firms operating under general cost functions. Our motivation is based on theoretical and also on empirical grounds. On the one hand, we are interested in seeing how the general properties of cost functions (e.g., subadditivity, superadditivity) affect licensing policies, in particular the diffusion of new technologies and the optimal combination of fees and royalties. On the other hand, empirical data shows that licensing policies vary from industry to industry. Given that modern industries differ also in the degree of returns to scale in production, our second goal is to bring forward the latter as an empirical factor that potentially interacts with actual licensing policies.22More on this important issue appears in Section 3.3.We carry out our analysis in a Cournot duopoly with a general demand function. Initially both competing firms produce under the same cost function. One of the firms obtains a patent on a technological innovation that changes this cost function. The patentee firm can either use the new technology exclusively or license it to its rival. The licensing policies available to the patentee consist of all combinations of linear royalties and upfront fees (two-part tariffs). The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows:1.A drastic technology33A cost-reducing technological innovation is drastic (Arrow, 1962) if it is significant enough to create a monopoly if only one firm has the new technology; otherwise, it is non drastic.is licensed and both firms are active in the market if the cost function resulting from the new technology is superadditive. If the cost function is additive or subadditive, then a drastic technology is not licensed and the patentee becomes a monopolist.A non drastic technology is licensed if at the licensee’s reservation output (i.e. its equilibrium output without a license), the average efficiency gain from the technology is (weakly) higher than the marginal gain.44At any output the average efficiency gain from the technology is the difference between the pre and post innovation average costs, while the marginal gain is the difference between the corresponding marginal costs.Whenever licensing occurs, it is always optimal to set positive royalties. Furthermore if the technology is significantly superior, upfront fees are also positive for superadditive cost functions. For additive cost functions, licensing involves only royalties and no fees and the same conclusion holds for subadditive functions under certain additional assumptions.To see the basic intuition behind these findings, consider first a drastic technology. Under subadditivity (increasing returns to scale), the maximum profit attainable in the industry is the monopoly profit. As the patentee can become a monopolist by exclusively using a drastic technology, it has no incentive to license such a technology to its rival. Under superadditivity (decreasing returns), the monopoly profit might no longer be the maximum attainable profit. In this case higher cost efficiency, and consequently higher industry profit, is achieved when both firms are active. As a result, licensing occurs and the market is not monopolized.In the case of a non drastic technology, there is a specific rate of royalty that induces a market equilibrium which replicates the equilibrium under no licensing (i.e., market prices are the same under the two regimes). Under this royalty, the market profit of the patentee is the same as its profit under no licensing. Adding the royalty revenues tilts the scale in favor of licensing. The assumption that the average efficiency gain from the new technology is higher than the marginal gain guarantees that the licensee accepts this policy.Optimal royalties are determined by two factors. First, the patentee intends to create a relatively inefficient rival and second, it has to consider how the rival’s efficiency affects its own marginal cost. Under increasing returns to scale, these two factors work in the same direction. A less efficient rival implies larger output and lower marginal cost for the patentee. Hence, the patentee has incentives to restrict the rival’s output under increasing returns, which is achieved by setting higher royalties. Under decreasing returns, the two factors do not work in the same direction, as creating a less efficient rival results in larger output and higher marginal cost for the patentee. For this reason the patentee is inclined to set lower royalties (and higher fees) under decreasing returns.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. The results are derived in Section 3. The last section concludes.Consider a Cournot duopoly with firms 1 and 2. Fori=1,2,let qi≥ 0 be the quantity produced by firm i andQ=q1+q2be the industry output. Letp(Q):R+→R+be the price function or the inverse demand function. We assumeA1 There exists Q0 > 0 such that (i)p(Q)=0for Q ≥ Q0 and (ii) for Q ∈ [0, Q0), p(Q) is positive and twice continuously differentiable with p′(Q) < 0, that is, p(Q) is decreasing for Q ∈ [0, Q0).A2p′(Q)+qp′′(Q)<0for all Q ∈ [0, Q0) and q ∈ [0, Q].The set of all feasible technologies isS=[0,ɛ¯].The total cost of producing q units under technology ε ∈ S is given bycɛ(q):R+→R+.A higher ε corresponds to a better technology and has a lower cost of production. Specifically we assumeA3 For every ε ∈ S: (i)cɛ(0)=0,(ii) cε(q) is twice continuously differentiable55Atq=0,we consider the right derivative for both functions p and cε.withcɛ′(q)>0for q > 0, that is, cε(q) is increasing in q, and (iii)p(0)>cɛ′(0).A4 For any q > 0, both the total cost cε(q) and the marginal costcɛ′(q)are decreasing and differentiable in ε.A5 For every ε ∈ S:p′(Q)−cɛ′′(q)<0for all Q ∈ [0, Q0) and q ∈ [0, Q].Initially both firms produce under the least efficient technology 0 ∈ S and have cost c0(q). Firm 1 has a patent for a superior technologyɛ∈(0,ɛ¯]that results in cost function cε(q). Firm 1 produces with the new technology. It may also license this technology to its rival firm 2. The set of licensing policies we consider is the set of all combinations of royalties and upfront fees (two-part tariffs) of the form (r, α) where r ≥ 0 is a unit royalty and α ≥ 0 is an upfront fee.A1–A5 are standard assumptions which guarantee uniqueness and stability of Cournot equilibrium (see, e.g., Gaudet & Salant, 1991; Kamien, Oren, & Tauman, 1992; Vives, 2001) under any licensing configuration.In this paper we consider three classes of cost functions: superadditive, subadditive and additive. Superadditivity represents production technologies characterized by decreasing returns to scale in production whereas subadditivity represents increasing returns. Additivity corresponds to constant returns.Definition 1For ε ∈ S, the cost function cε is superadditive ifcɛ(q+q˜)>cɛ(q)+cɛ(q˜)for allq,q˜>0and it is subadditive ifcɛ(q+q˜)<cɛ(q)+cɛ(q˜)for allq,q˜>0.Ifc(q):R+→R+is a convex (concave) function withc(0)=0,then it is superadditive (subadditive) but the converse is not true. Consider the function c(q) defined on q ≥ 0 asc(q)=qexp(−1/q2)for q > 0 andc(0)=0.This function is superadditive, but not convex.66For more such counter-examples, see Bourin and Hiai (2015), who explore a large class of superadditive functions. For the early literature on superadditive functions, see, e.g., Bruckner (1962); 1964), Beckenbach (1964).For ε ∈ S, the cost function cε is additive if it satisfies Cauchy’s basic equationcɛ(q+q˜)=cɛ(q)+cɛ(q˜)for allq,q˜≥0.If an additive function cε is continuous at a point, then ∃ kε such that(1)cɛ(q)=kɛqforallq≥0For the proof, see Theorem 1, p. 34 of Aczél (1966). By (1) and A3 it follows that if a technology ε has additive cost function, thencɛ′(q)=kɛ>0.An additive cost function thus results in constant marginal cost of production. If the initial technology 0 and the new technology ε both have additive cost functions, then the magnitude of the cost reduction from the new technology for every unit of production isk0−kɛ>0.This case has been extensively studied in the literature of patent licensing (see, e.g., Sen & Tauman, 2007; Wang, 1998).The following lemma provides a useful characterization of three different classes of cost functions in terms of marginal costs.Letc(q):R+→R+be a twice continuously differentiable cost function withc(0)=0.For any q > 0, c′(q) ≥ c′(0) if c is superadditive, c′(q) ≤ c′(0) if c is subadditive andc′(q)=c′(0)if c is additive.See the Appendix.□The strategic interaction between the two firms is modeled as an extensive-form game G that has three stages. In the first stage, firm 1 decides whether to license the new technology ε to firm 2 or not. If firm 1 decides to license, it offers firm 2 a licensing policy (r, α). In the second stage, firm 2 decides whether to accept or reject any licensing policy offered. Finally, in the third stage the two firms simultaneously choose quantities q1, q2 in the Cournot duopoly.If firm 2 has a license of technology ε under a policy (r, α), it pays firm 1 the upfront fee α and in addition pays royalty r for every unit it produces. If firm 2 does not have a license, it produces with technology 0. Let λ be the indicator variable withλ=1if firm 2 has a license andλ=0if it does not. The payoff functions of firms 1, 2 (these are functions of (r, α), λ, q1, q2) in the game G are(2)Πɛ1=p(Q)q1−cɛ(q1)+λ(rq2+α),Πɛ2=p(Q)q2−λ[cɛ(q2)+rq2+α]−(1−λ)c0(q2)We determine Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) outcome of G. Working backwards, we begin with the Cournot stage of this game and then move to the initial stages.Consider the third stage of G where firms compete in quantities. Fori=1,2,let πibe the duopoly profit of firm i in the Counrot stage. From (2), we have(3)π1=p(Q)q1−cɛ(q1),π2=p(Q)q2−λ[cɛ(q2)+rq2+α]−(1−λ)c0(q2)To find SPNE of G, for every r ≥ 0 and λ ∈ {0, 1}, we need to determine Nash equilibrium (NE) of the corresponding Cournot duopoly where firms 1, 2 choose q1, q2 to obtain profits given by77Since α is a lump-sum transfer paid upfront, it has no effect on the outcomes of the Cournot duopoly. As firm 1’s choice of q1 does not affect its royalty revenue λrq2, this revenue can be left out from the profit of firm 1 at the Cournot stage. However, for firm 2, its choice of q2 does affect its royalty payments λrq2, so these payments are part of its cost function in the Cournot duopoly.(3). As the cost functions of both firms satisfy A3–A5, existence and uniqueness of NE of the Cournot duopoly is guaranteed under both cases of licensing and no licensing. The notion of drastic technology (Arrow, 1962) will be useful for our analysis.Definition 3The new technology is drastic if it is significant enough to create a monopoly when only one firm uses it; otherwise, it is non drastic.To characterize drastic technologies, consider the monopoly problem. For any ε ∈ S, letϕɛ(q):=p(q)q−cɛ(q)denote the profit function of a monopolist who faces inverse demand p(Q) and produces under cost cε(Q). By A1–A5, ϕε(q) is concave in q and the monopoly problem maxq ≥ 0ϕε(q) has a unique solution. Denote this solution byqɛm(the monopoly output). Letpɛm=p(qɛm)be the monopoly price andπɛm=ϕɛ(qɛm)be the monopoly profit. A1–A5 also ensure thatqɛmis increasing (and hencepɛmis decreasing) in ε.Lemma 2 describes the key features of Cournot equilibrium under the two cases of licensing and no licensing.For all ε ∈ S, r ≥ 0 and λ ∈ {0, 1}, the Cournot duopoly has a unique NE. Fori=1,2,letq^ɛi,π^ɛidenote NE (Cournot) output, profit of firm i when firm 2 does not have a license and letQ^ɛ=q^ɛ1+q^ɛ2.Letqɛi(r),πɛi(r),Qɛ(r)be the corresponding expressions when firm 2 has a license with royalty r.(i)Suppose firm 2 does not have a license. Ifpɛm>c0′(0),thenq^ɛ1,q^ɛ2are both positive and ifpɛm≤c0′(0),thenq^ɛ1=qɛm,q^ɛ2=0.Consequently a technology ε ∈ S is drastic ifpɛm≤c0′(0)and it is non drastic otherwise. Moreover,q^ɛ1,π^ɛ1,Q^ɛare increasing in ε and for non drastic technologiesq^ɛ2,π^ɛ2are decreasing in ε.Suppose firm 2 has a license with royalty r ≥ 0. There existsr¯ɛ≡pɛm−cɛ′(0)>0such that ifr<r¯ɛ,thenqɛ1(r),qɛ2(r)are both positive and ifr≥r¯ɛ,thenqɛ1(r)=qɛm,qɛ2(r)=0.Moreover,qɛ1(r),πɛ1(r)are increasing andqɛ2(r),πɛ2(r),Qɛ(r)are decreasing in r forr≤r¯ɛ.For any non drastic technology ε, there are royaltiesr^ɛ,rɛ*∈(0,r¯ɛ)such thatπɛ2(r)⪌π^ɛ2⇔r⪋r^ɛandqɛ2(r)⪌q^ɛ2⇔r⪋rɛ*.Moreoverqɛ1(rɛ*)=q^ɛ1andQɛ(rɛ*)=Q^ɛ.See the Appendix.□Lemma 2 characterizes Cournot equilibrium and delivers the standard comparative statics results. When there is no licensing, expectedly the quantity of firm 1 increases in the quality of the new technology ε. Our assumptions guarantee that standard effects will then follow: A2 implies that best-replies are negatively sloped, hence quantity of firm 2 falls in ε. A5 implies that the net effect of ε on industry output is positive.When there is licensing with royalty r, expectedlyqɛ2(r)(whenever positive) falls in r. Then A2 implies thatqɛ1(r)increases in r and A5 implies that the net effect of r on industry output Qε(r) is negative. The last part of the lemma identifies two specific thresholds of royalties: one that equates firm 2’s Cournot profits with and without a license and the other one that equates its Cournot outputs. These thresholds will be useful to determine licensing policies that are acceptable to firm 2.Sincep0m>c0′(0),it follows by Lemma 2 that the initial technology 0 is non drastic. Note thatpɛmis continuous and decreasing in ε. Henceforth we assume that ∃ɛD∈(0,ɛ¯)such thatpɛm>c0′(0)if ε ∈ [0, εD) andpɛm≤c0′(0)ifɛ∈[ɛD,ɛ¯].This ensures that sets of non drastic and drastic technologies are both non empty. Any technology ε < εDis non drastic and ε ≥ εDis drastic.Given the analysis of the previous section, we next move to the initial stages of G. If firm 2 accepts a licensing policy (r, α), the payoffΠɛ1(r,α)of firm 1 is the sum of its duopoly profit and licensing revenue. For firm 2, note from (3) that royalty payments are already included as part of cost in its duopoly profit. So firm 2’s payoffΠɛ2(r,α)is its duopoly profit net of upfront fee. Using the equilibrium values of profits and quantities from Lemma 2, we haveΠɛ1(r,α)=πɛ1(r)+rqɛ2(r)+α,Πɛ2(r,α)=πɛ2(r)−αBy Lemma 2, if firm 2 rejects the licensing policy, it obtainsπ^ɛ2.Hence for any r, it is optimal for firm 1 to set the fee α equal toαɛ(r):=πɛ2(r)−π^ɛ2making firm 2 just indifferent between accepting and rejecting the licensing offer.88If royalty r is such thatπɛ2(r)<π^ɛ2,then even with zero fee firm 2’s payoff with a license is lower than its payoff without a license. As upfront fees are non-negative, such a royalty will not be accepted by firm 2. By Lemma 2(iii), it follows that any licensing policy with royaltyr>r^ɛis not acceptable to firm 2.Therefore, if firm 1 decides to offer a license, its problem reduces to choose r ≥ 0 to maximize(4)Πɛ1(r)=πɛ1(r)+rqɛ2(r)+πɛ2(r)−π^ɛ2=p(Qɛ(r))Qɛ(r)−cɛ(qɛ1(r))−cɛ(qɛ2(r))−π^ɛ2On the other hand, if firm 1 does not offer a license, it obtainsπ^ɛ1.We are now in a position to determine optimal licensing policies for firm 1.The following general result shows that royalties must be positive whenever licensing occurs.Proposition 1If firm 1 offers a license to firm 2, it is always optimal to set a positive royalty.See the Appendix.□Proposition 1 holds under A1–A5 without any further assumptions. However, setting a positive royalty may not necessarily be optimal for a patentee firm when it competes in an oligopoly of size n ≥ 3. In the duopoly model firm 2’s reservation payoffπ^ɛ2(i.e., its payoff when it does not have a license) is independent of the rate of royalty r. But in an oligopoly of general size, if a specific firm is without a license, some other firms might have a license; so the reservation payoff of a non-licensee does depend on r. This may lead to a conclusion different from Proposition 1 (see, e.g., Sen & Stamatopoulos, 2009).Further characterization of optimal licensing policies depends on whether the new technology is drastic or non drastic.Consider a drastic technology ε. For this case, if firm 2 does not have a license it exits the market and firm 1 becomes a monopolist, i.e.,π^ɛ2=0andπ^ɛ1=πɛm. Proposition 2 shows that firm 1’s decision to license or not depends crucially on the nature of new technology. It should be also noted that these results do not require any additional assumption on the initial technology 0 apart from A3–A5.Proposition 2Consider a drastic technology ε, i.e.,ɛ∈[ɛD,ɛ¯].The following hold.(I)Regardless of whether there is licensing or not, firm 2 obtains zero net payoff.If cε(q) is subadditive or additive, licensing does not occur. Firm 1 becomes a monopolist and obtainsπɛm.If cε(q) is superadditive andcɛ′(qɛm)>cɛ′(0),then licensing occurs.99Superaddivity andcɛ(0)=0already implycɛ′(q)≥cɛ′(0)for all q > 0 (see Lemma 1). The inequality in the proposition requires the marginal cost at the monopoly outputqɛmto be different from that at 0.Any optimal licensing policy has positive royalty and upfront fee. Both firms are active and firm 1 obtains more thanπɛm.Firm 2’s net payoff under any optimal licensing policy is its payoff without a license:π^ɛ2.Sinceπ^ɛ2=0for a drastic technology ε, (I) follows.For (II) and (III), note that by not offering a license, firm 1 obtains the monopoly profitπɛm.By Lemma 2(ii), offering a license with royaltyr≥r¯ɛfor a drastic technology ε results in the same outcome as not offering a license. So it is sufficient to consider licensing policies withr∈[0,r¯ɛ).In that case both firms produce positive outputs.(II) Let cε(q) be subadditive or additive. Takingπ^ɛ2=0in (4), forr∈[0,r¯ɛ),we have(5)Πɛ1(r)=p(Qɛ(r))Qɛ(r)−cɛ(qɛ1(r))−cɛ(qɛ2(r))≤p(Qɛ(r))Qɛ(r)−cɛ(Q(r))<πɛmwhere the first inequality is strict if cε(q) subadditive and holds with equality if cε(q) is additive. The second inequality is due to the fact that the monopolist’s profit is maximized atqɛmandQɛ(r)<qɛmforr∈[0,r¯ɛ)(Lemma 2(ii)).(III) Let cε(q) be superadditive andcɛ′(qɛm)>cɛ′(0).ThenΠɛ1(r)is decreasing atr=r¯ɛ(see Lemma A3 of the Appendix). Together with Proposition 1, this implies that it is optimal for firm 1 to license and any optimal policy must haver∈(0,r¯ɛ)and upfront feeπɛ2(r)−π^ɛ2=πɛ2(r)>0.AsΠɛ1(r)=πɛmforr≥r¯ɛ,under any optimal policy firm 1 obtains more thanπɛm.□Under additivity or subadditivity of the new technology (constant or increasing returns to scale), the maximum achievable payoff is the monopoly profitπɛm.Since firm 1 can obtain the monopoly profit by using a drastic technology exclusively, licensing does not occur. Under superadditivity (decreasing returns), the monopoly profit is no longer the upper bound of industry profit, as production of output by a single firm creates cost inefficiencies. For this case firm 1 has an incentive to keep firm 2 active in the market. The presence of two active firms increases efficiency and results in higher surplus than the monopoly profit, which firm 1 extracts via a fee.We note that the result that a firm might sell a drastic technology to its rival has been obtained in a different context by Faulí-Oller and Sandonís (2002) who analyzed licensing in a differentiated goods duopoly under constant returns to scale. In that framework, a patentee transfers a drastic technology to its rival as it does not want to close the rival’s profitable market. Proposition 2 brings forward an alternative motive of licensing of a drastic technology, namely, cost efficiency under decreasing returns.To characterize optimal licensing policies for a non drastic technology ε, letF(q):=c0(q)−cɛ(q).Note by A4 that F(q), F′(q) are both positive for any q > 0. F(q) represents the total gain in efficiency for q units obtained from the superior technology ε. Accordingly, F(q)/q stands for the average gain and F′(q) the marginal gain. For q > 0, define(6)H(q):=F′(q)F(q)/qThe functionH(q)is the ratio of average and marginal gains in efficiency obtained from using the superior technology ε.Recall the two threshold levels of royaltiesrɛ*,r^ɛfrom Lemma 2(iii). Atr=rɛ*,the Cournot outputs of firms coincide with their no-licensing levels and atr=r^ɛ,the Cournot profit of firm 2 equals its profit without a license. For a licensing policy with royalty r, the maximum upfront fee isαɛ(r)=πɛ2(r)−π^ɛ2.A policy (r, αε(r)) is acceptable to firm 2 if and only ifr∈[0,r^ɛ].Lemma 3 utilizes the functionH(q)together withrɛ*,r^ɛto determine values of royalties that make a licensing agreement beneficial for both firms.Lemma 3The following hold for a non drastic technology ε.(i)Πɛ1(rɛ*)>π^ɛ1,i.e., for firm 1, licensing under policy(rɛ*,α(rɛ*))yields a higher payoff than the no licensing.SupposeH(q^ɛ2)≤1.Thenrɛ*≤r^ɛand consequently there exist licensing policies acceptable to firm 2 in which firm 1 obtains a higher payoff than no licensing.See the Appendix.□Atr=rɛ*,the Cournot profit of firm 1 is the same as its profit under no licensing, but it obtains additional licensing revenue, yielding a surplus for firm 1. Whether firm 2 also obtains a surplus there depends on the inequalityH(q^ɛ2)≤1,which says that the marginal efficiency gain obtained from the new technology is lower than the average gain when both are computed at firm 2’s Cournot output without a license. As licensing withr=rɛ*results in same Cournot outputs and price as no licensing, firm 2’s Cournot profit is higher under licensing if and only if its total cost is lower under licensing, i.e.,πɛ2(rɛ*)≥π^ɛ2⇔cɛ(q^ɛ2)+rɛ*q^ɛ2≤c0(q^ɛ2)⇔rɛ*≤F(q^ɛ2)/q^ɛ2Sincerɛ*=F′(q^ɛ2)(see the proof of Lemma 3 in the Appendix), it follows thatπ2(rɛ*)≥π^ɛ2⇔H(q^ɛ2)≤1.In particular this inequality impliesrɛ*≤F(q^ɛ2)/q^ɛ2,meaning that the unit royalty does not exceed the average gain in efficiency from the superior technology. This ensures that licensing under royaltyrɛ*leaves a surplus to firm 2.Using the conditionH(q^ɛ2)≤1,we can characterize optimal licensing policies for additive and superadditive cases.Proposition 3Consider a non drastic technology ε, i.e., ε ∈ (0, εD). IfH(q^ɛ2)≤1,then licensing occurs. The optimal licensing policies have the following properties.(I)If cε(q) is additive, then the unique optimal licensing policy for firm 1 has royaltyr=r^ɛand zero upfront fee, i.e., it is a pure royalty policy.IfcɛD(q)is superadditive andcɛD′(qɛDm)>cɛD′(0),then ∃0<ɛ^<ɛDsuch that for allɛ∈(ɛ^,ɛD),any optimal licensing policy for firm 1 has both positive royalty as well as positive upfront fee.See the Appendix.□Note from (1) that if cε(q) is additive, thencɛ(q)=kɛq.If the initial technology 0 also has an additive cost function, thenc0(q)=k0q.In that case for any q > 0, we haveF′(q)=F(q)/q=k0−kɛandH(q)=1.Therefore the conditionH(q^ɛ2)≤1holds for the standard case studied in the literature where both new and initial technologies have constant returns. The conclusion of part (I) is the same as the result of Sen and Tauman (2007) for a Cournot duopoly with an incumbent patentee.Observe that εDis the threshold that separates non drastic and drastic technologies. Part (II) of the proposition shows that if technology εDhas a superadditive cost function, then for all sufficiently significant non drastic technologies (i.e., technologies ε that are close enough to εD) any optimal policy has both royalty and upfront fee.When cε(q) is subadditive, the conditionH(q^ɛ2)≤1alone is not enough to characterize optimal licensing policies.1010As shown in the proof of Proposition 3, for technologies ε that are close enough to εD, in the superadditive case firm 1’s payoff is decreasing atr=r^ɛ(the maximum acceptable royalty for firm 2). This implies that any optimal policy has royaltyr<r^ɛand the upfront fee is positive. Applying similar reasoning for the subadditive case will show that firm 1’s payoff is increasing atr=r^ɛ.But this does not conclusively say whether it is optimal to setr=r^ɛ(and zero fee) orr<r^ɛ(and positive fee).More structure on the cost function is needed.DefinitionLet x0 > 0. A functionf:R+→R+is interval-wise decreasing at x0 if f(x) > f(x0) for x < x0 and f(x) < f(x0) for x > x0.Note that interval-wise decreasing property at x0 implies f(x) < f(y) if x < x0 < y, but it does not specify any order between f(x), f(y) when x, y are both lower (or both higher) than x0. We shall use this concept to impose further structure on a cost function. Note from Lemma 2 that when there is licensing with zero royalty, both firms produce the same Cournot output. Denote this output by qε(0) and note thatqɛ2(r)<qɛ(0)<qɛ1(r)for any r > 0. Proposition 4 shows that optimal licensing policies can be completely characterized if the marginal cost functioncɛ′(q)is interval-wise decreasing at1111Note that if cε(q) is concave, thencɛ′(q)is decreasing for all q ≥ 0 and in particular it is interval-wise decreasing at any q > 0. Thus, interval-wise decreasing property of the marginal cost at a certain point is a weaker requirement than concavity of the cost function.qε(0). Before stating the proposition, it will be useful to see the implications of interval-wise decreasing property of the marginal cost function.The following hold ifcɛ′(q)is interval-wise decreasing at qε(0).(i)cε(q) cannot be additive or superadditive.For anyr∈(0,r¯ɛ),cɛ(qɛ1(r)+qɛ2(r))<cɛ(qɛ1(r))+cɛ(qɛ2(r)).(i) Sincecɛ′(q)is interval-wise decreasing at qε(0) > 0, we havecɛ′(0)>cɛ′(qɛ(0)).Then by Lemma 1 it follows that cε(q) cannot be additive or superadditive.(ii) We drop subscript ε for brevity. Recall from Lemma 2(ii) that forr∈(0,r¯),0 < q2(r) < q(0) < q1(r). Since c′(q) is interval-wise decreasing at q(0), we havec′(x)>c′(q(0))forx<q2(r)andc′(x)<c′(q(0))forx>q1(r)Hencec(q1(r)+q2(r))−[c(q1(r))+c(q2(r))]=∫q1(r)q1(r)+q2(r)c′(x)dx−∫0q2(r)c′(x)dx,which is lower than∫q1(r)q1(r)+q2(r)c′(q(0))dx−∫0q2(r)c′(q(0))dx=0.This completes the proof.□Lemma 4 shows that ifcɛ′(q)is interval-wise decreasing at qε(0), then cε(q) is outside the set of superadditive and additive functions and the “subaddivity inequality”cɛ(q+q˜)<cɛ(q)+cɛ(q˜)holds for all pairs(q,q˜)that arise as Cournot equilibrium under any licensing policy.Proposition 4Consider a non drastic technology ε. SupposeH(q^ɛ2)≤1andcɛ′(q)is interval-wise decreasing at qε(0). Then the unique optimal licensing policy for firm 1 has royaltyr=r^ɛand zero upfront fee, i.e., it is a pure royalty policy.See the Appendix.□In particular, if cε(q) is subadditive and satisfies the conditions of Proposition 4, then pure royalty emerges as the unique optimal licensing policy. Putting together the results of Propositions 3 and 4, the general conclusion is that for non drastic technologies a patentee licenses to its rival by setting the maximum possible royalty and zero upfront fee for constant or increasing returns (subject to some additional structure on the cost function). By contrast, for decreasing returns, royalties are set lower and there are positive fees.The result that royalties tend to be higher under increasing returns seems to be consistent with some real life observations on royalty rates in various industries. A recent survey by Held and Parker (2011) computed the average royalty rates in some major industries in USA and Canada for the period 2008–2011. The higher average royalty rates were found in sectors such as aerospace (commercial and military), transportation and information technology and equipment, i.e., sectors usually associated with increasing returns to scale. Of course, one needs to look at industry-specific data for a better understanding of the observed licensing policies. Still, some sort of association between returns to scale and optimal licensing policies seems to be in place.This paper has analyzed optimal licensing policies of a cost-reducing innovation in a market with general cost functions. In a Cournot duopoly with one of the firms as a patentee, we have derived a fairly complete characterization of licensing policies under a general setting. We have shown that if licensing occurs, then royalties must be positive (Proposition 1), licensing of drastic technologies depends on whether the cost function generated by the new technology is superadditive or subadditive (Proposition 2), licensing of non drastic technologies depends on the relation between the marginal and average efficiency gains obtained from the superior technology (Proposition 3), for significantly superior technologies, superadditivity ensures that fees are positive (Proposition 3) and subadditivity or additivity results in maximum possible royalty and zero fees (Propositions 3 and 4).In conclusion, we suggest some extensions. The analysis of licensing in a market with n ≥ 3 firms operating under general cost functions is the most natural direction for future work. Another interesting direction is to consider markets where firms compete in prices under non-constant returns. This case is interesting not only for licensing but also from a market equilibrium viewpoint: it is known that a multiplicity of price equilibria emerges when two firms operate in homogeneous goods markets under decreasing returns (Dastidar, 1995). The introduction of licensing changes the objective function of the incumbent patentee in the price stage of the game fromp1d1(p1,p2)−cɛ(d1(p1,p2))top1d1(p1,p2)−cɛ(d1(p1,p2))+rd2(p1,p2),where di(p1, p2) denotes the demand function of firm i and pidenotes the price set by firm i. It will be interesting to see how this modification of the objective function affects the set of price equilibria.
