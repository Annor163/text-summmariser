@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The objective of this paper is divided into two folds. Firstly, a new generalized improved score function has been presented in the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) environment by incorporating the idea of weighted average of the degree of hesitation between their membership functions. Secondly, an IVIFSs based method for solving the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem has been presented with completely unknown attribute weights. A ranking of the different attributes is based on the proposed generalized improved score functions and the sensitivity analysis on the ranking of the system has been done based on the decision-making parameters. An illustrative examples have been studied to show that the proposed function is more reasonable in the decision-making process than other existing functions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is one of the process for finding the optimal alternative from all the feasible alternatives according to some criteria or attributes. Traditionally, it has been generally assumed that all the information which access the alternative in terms of criteria and their corresponding weights are expressed in the form of crisp numbers. But it has been widely recognized that most of the decisions in the real-life situations are taken in the environment where the goals and constraints are generally imprecise or vague in nature and hence cannot estimate his preference with an exact numerical value. This is due to the fact that most of the information given by the decision-makers should be under time pressure and lack of knowledge or data. Moreover, it may be that the decision makers have limited information processing capacities. Therefore, the analysis conducted under such circumstances are not ideal and hence does not tell the exact information to the system analyst. To cope with such situation, fuzzy set theory [1] has been widely used for handling the uncertainties and vagueness of the data. After their successful application of the fuzzy set theory, researchers are engaged in their extensions and out of that intuitionistic fuzzy set theory [2] is one of the most permissible extensions of the fuzzy set theory and has been widely used in MCDM. The concept of IFSs is an alternative approach to define the fuzzy set in terms of their degree of membership and nonmembership such that their sum is less than or equal to one. Atanassov and Gargov [3] found that IFSs need the decision maker to give the exact values of the membership degree, the non-membership degree and the hesitancy degree. This is still difficult in some situations. For handling this issue, it is convenient to express the decision makers information/preferences in the form of interval values rather than point values and hence called interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) that are characterized by an interval membership function, an interval non-membership function and an interval hesitancy function. Such a generalization further facilitates representing inherent imprecision and uncertainty of the decision makers.Wang and Wang [4] presented a method for multi-attribute decision making under the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment, where all the information is characterized by interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and the information about the weights of the attributes are incomplete. Ye [5] presented a method for multicriteria fuzzy decision making based on an accuracy function under the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Nayagam et al. [6] presented a method for multicriteria decision making based on ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Wang et al. [7] presented multi-attribute decision making models and methods under the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Xiao and Wei [8] presented a method to deal with the supplier selection problem in supply chain management with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information. Liu and Xie [9] presented the weighted score function and the weighted accuracy function of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets for multicriteria fuzzy decision making. Luo et al. [10] presented a method for multicriteria fuzzy decision making based on the weighted correlation coefficient of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Wei [11] developed an intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric operator-based approach to solve multi-attribute group decision making problems. Bai [12] proposed an improved score function for the effective ranking order of the interval-valued IFSs and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method based on the score function to solve MADM in which information about the criterion weights is known. Zhang et al. [13] proposed an entropy based decision making method to solve MADM problems with completely unknown attribute weights. Mitchell [14] and Nayagam et al. [15] studied ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Xu [16] and Xu and Chen [17] proposed score function and accuracy function to rank interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Ye [18] proposed an improved algorithm for score functions by taking into account the effect of an unknown degree (hesitancy degree) of vague sets and a multi criteria decision-making method based on the score function of vague sets. Xu [19] developed some aggregation operators for IVIFSs, such as the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric aggregation (IIFWGA) operator and the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic aggregation (IIFWAA) operator, and gave an application of the IIFWGA and IIFWAA operators to multi criteria decision-making problems by using the score function and accuracy function of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Wang et al. [20] developed a method for comparing two IVIFNs by introducing two new functions: the membership uncertainty index and the hesitation uncertainty index. Chen et al. [21] proposed a new method for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values to overcome the drawback of Ye [5] accuracy function. Chen [22] gave a comparative analysis of score functions for multi criteria decision-making in intuitionistic fuzzy settings. Xu and Wang [23,24] developed an aggregation operators to solve the multiple attribute decision making problems under Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Garg et al. [25] proposed entropy based multi-criteria decision making method under the fuzzy environment and by unknown attribute weights. Garg [26] developed some new intuitionistic fuzzy multiplicative interactive weighted geometric (IFMIWG), intuitionistic fuzzy multiplicative interactive ordered weighted geometric (IFMIOWG) and intuitionistic fuzzy multiplicative interactive hybrid weighted geometric (IFMIHWG) operators to solve the multiple criteria decision making problems. Wu and Chiclana [27] presented a risk attitudinal ranking method for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on novel score and accuracy expected functions.As the ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers plays a main role in real life problems involving intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making, intuitionistic fuzzy clustering. However, in some cases the existing proposed technique for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers using a score or accuracy functions do not give sufficient information about the alternatives. Therefore, there is a need of such improved score function which will handle the shortcomings of the above score functions and give the decision maker regarding the sufficient information about the alternatives. Moreover, from the survey, it has been observed that the final ranking order of alternatives highly depends on the attribute weights and hence the proper assessment of the attribute weights play a dominant role in the decision-making process. Based on the information acquisition, the attribute weights in multi-criteria decision making is classified as subjective as well as objective. The former ones are determined by preference information on the attributes as given by the decision-maker while the latter one are determined by the decision-making matrix. The Shannon entropy method is one of the most famous approach for determining the objective attribute weights, which express the relative intensities of attribute importance to signify the average intrinsic information transmitted to the decision maker. Thus, it is an important task for finding the proper attribute weights which will help the decision maker for obtaining the efficient decision under a reasonable time.Therefore, the objective of this paper is divided into two folds. Firstly, generalized improved score function has been proposed by taking into account the unknown degree (hesitancy degree) of IVIFSs. Secondly, based on these generalized score functions, decision making method has been proposed for solving the MCDM problems. In order to see the relative importance of criteria, weights to each criteria have been given by using the intuitionistic fuzzy entropy measure and a generalized interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy averaging operator (GIVIFWA) emphasizing the individual influence is used to aggregate all individual decision makers’ opinion for rating candidates. The proposed score function has been applied to compare the IVIFSs and the grade of alternatives. The rest of the manuscript has been described as follows. Section 2 presented the brief overview of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets and the existing score and accuracy function. The shortcoming of the existing and the proposed generalized improved score function is described in Section 3. Section 4 presented the MCDM approach in an IVIFSs environment for choosing the best alternative among the feasible alternatives. Finally the approach has been illustrated through a case studies given in Section 5. The concrete conclusion about the manuscript is described in Section 6.Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) is one of the widely used and successful extension of the concept of fuzzy set [1]. In order to model the hesitation and uncertainty about the degree of membership, Atanassov in 1986 [2] add an extra degree, called as degree of non-membership, to the notion of the fuzzy set. In fuzzy set, the hesitation degree or degree of non-membership of an element of the universe is simply defined as one minus the degree of membership functions and therefore it is fixed. But in real-life or many situations, there is a degree of hesitation between the membership functions and hence they are independent.An intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS)A˜in a finite universe of discourse X={x1, x2, …, xn} is given by [2]A˜={〈x,μA(x),νA(x)〉|x∈X}where μA(x) and νA(x) are the membership and non-membership functions ofA˜. The numbers μA(x) and νA(x) describes respectively the degree of belonging and rejection of x∈X inA˜. For convenience, an IFN α is expressed as 〈μ, ν〉, whereμ∈[0,1],ν∈[0,1]andμ+ν∈[0,1]As for the IFNs, Xu [19] defined the operations for three IFNs α=〈μ, ν〉, α1=〈μ1, ν1〉 and α2=〈μ2, ν2〉, λ>0, as follows:•α1⊕α2=〈1−(1−μ1)(1−μ2), ν1ν2〉.α1⊗α2=〈μ1μ2, 1−(1−ν1)(1−ν2)〉.λα=〈1−(1−μ)λ, νλ〉.αλ=〈μλ, 1−(1−ν)λ〉.Based on the definition of IFWA operator, Zhao et al. [28] introduced the generalized IFWA denoted by GIFWA operator and is defined as follows.GIFWA(α1,α2,…,αn)=ω1α1λ⊕ω2α2λ⊕⋯⊕ωnαnλ1/λ=1−∏j=1n1−μjλωj1/λ,1−1−∏j=1n1−1−νjλωj1/λwhere λ>0 is a real number. From this operator, it has been seen that IFWA operator is a special case of GIFWA operator. As these operations are widely used by the researchers for aggregating the different preferences but they have several drawbacks. For instance, consider the four IFNs α1=〈0.72, 0.00〉, α2=〈0.63, 0.36〉, α3=〈0.31, 0.62〉 and α4=〈0.71, 0.22〉 and ω=(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1) be standardized weight vector of the four IFNs. Thus these IFNs are aggregated by using GIFWA operator for different values of λ as•When λ=1, GIFWA(α1, α2, α3, α4)=〈0.5618, 0〉.When λ=2, GIFWA(α1, α2, α3, α4)=〈0.5790, 0〉.When λ=10, GIFWA(α1, α2, α3, α4)=〈0.6517, 0〉.α1⊕α2=〈1−(1−μ1)(1−μ2), (1−μ1)(1−μ2)−(1−(μ1+ν1))(1−(μ2+ν2))〉.α1⊗α2=〈(1−ν1)(1−ν2)−(1−(μ1+ν1))(1−(μ2+ν2)), 1−(1−ν1)(1−ν2)〉.λα=〈1−(1−μ)λ, (1−μ)λ−(1−μ−ν)λ〉.αλ=〈(1−ν)λ−(1−μ−ν)λ, 1−(1−ν)λ〉.Based on these operations, Yu [29] defined the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy interactive weighted average (GIFIWA) operator for aggregating the families of IFNs(α1, α2, …, αn) asGIFIWA(α1,α2,…,αn)=ω1α1λ⊕ω2α2λ⊕⋯⊕ωnαnλ1/λ=1−∏i=1n1−(1−νi)λ+(1−(μi+νi))λwi+∏i=1n(1−(μi−νi))λwj1/λ−∏i=1n(1−(μi+νi)wi),1−1−∏i=1n(1−(1−νi)λ+(1−(μi+νi))λ)wi+〈∏i=1n(1−(μi+νi))λwi1/λHere, the parameter λ plays a significant role during the information aggregation process. When λ=1 then GIFIWA operator is reduced to GIFWA operator. Now, GIFIWA operator has been applied to the above four IFNs then for different values of λ, the aggregator values are•When λ=1, GIFWA(α1, α2, α3, α4)=〈0.5618, 0.3867〉.When λ=2, GIFWA(α1, α2, α3, α4)=〈0.6982, 0.2502〉.When λ=10, GIFWA(α1, α2, α3, α4)=〈0.9405, 0.0080〉.Thus, the aggregated results based on GIFIWA operators seems to be reasonable.Let D[0, 1] be the set of all closed subintervals of the interval [0,1] and let non-empty X be a given set. An IVIFSA˜in X is defined as [3]A˜={(x,μA(x),νA(x))|x∈X}where μA:X→D[0, 1], νA:X→D[0, 1] with the condition that 0≤sup(μA(x))+sup(νA(x))≤1 for any x∈X. For each x∈X, μA(x) and νA(x) are closed intervals and their lower and upper boundaries are denoted byμAL(x),μAU(x),νAL(x)andνAU(x). Therefore, another equivalent way to express IVIFSA˜isA˜=x,μAL(x),μAU(x),νAL(x),νAU(x)|x∈XwhereμAU(x)+νAU(x)≤1,0≤μAL(x)≤μAU(x)≤1,0≤νAL(x)≤νAU(x)≤1Similar to IFSs, for each element x∈X, its hesitation interval relative toA˜is given asπA(x)=πAL(x),πAU(x)=1−μAU(x)−νAU(x),1−μAL(x)−νAL(x)Especially, for every x∈X, ifμA(x)=μAL(x)=μAU(x),νA(x)=νAL(x)=νAU(x)then, IVIFSA˜reduces to an ordinary IFS.For an IVIFSA˜and a given x, the pair (μA(x), νA(x)) is called an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number (IVIFN). For convenience, the pair (μA(x), νA(x)) is often denoted by ([a, b], [c, d]), where [a, b]∈D[0, 1], [c, d]∈D[0, 1], and b+d≤1.Consider a family of IVIFNs(α1, α2, …, αn), ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn) is the standardized weight vector, then generalized interval value intuitionistic fuzzy interactive weighted averaging (GIVIFIWA) operator is defined as follows.(1)GIVIFIWA(α1,α2,…,αn)=ω1α1λ⊕ω2α2λ⊕⋯⊕ωnαnλ1/λ;λ>0=〈[A,B],[C,D]〉whereA=(1−∏j=1n(1−(1−cij)λ+(1−(aij+cij))λ)wj+∏j=1n(1−(aij+cij))λwj)1/λ−∏j=1n(1−(aij+cij)wj)B=(1−∏j=1n(1−(1−dij)λ+(1−(bij+dij)λ)wj+∏j=1n(1−(bij+dij))λwj)1/λ−∏j=1n(1−(bij+dij)wj)C=1−(1−∏j=1n(1−(1−cij)λ+(1−(aij+cij))λ)wj+∏j=1n(1−(aij+cij))λwj)1/λD=1−(1−∏j=1n(1−(1−dij)λ+(1−(bij+dij))λ)wj+∏j=1n(1−(bij+dij))λwj)1/λIn order to compare two or more IVIFSs, some metric methods has been discussed by the various authors in terms of score and accuracy functions for IVIFS A=<[a, b], [c, d]> which are given as follows.(i)Score function [16]S(A)=a+b−c−d2,S(A)∈[−1,1]Accuracy function [16]H(A)=a+b+c+d2,H(A)∈[0,1]Novel accuracy function [5]M(A)=a−(1−a−c)+b−(1−b−d)2,M(A)∈[−1,1]Another accuracy function [6]L(A)=a+b−d(1−b)−c(1−a)2,L(A)∈[−1,1]Improved score function [12]I(A)=a+a(1−a−c)+b+b(1−b−d)2,I(A)∈[0,1]A numerical example has been given to show that these existing score functions is not a consistent to find the best alternative.Example 2.1Consider the two IFSs represented in the form of interval-valued as A1=<[0.2, 0.8], [0.1, 0.2]> and A2=<[0.3, 0.7], [0.0, 0.3]>. In order to find the best alternative out of these two alternatives A1 and A2, ranking of these numbers has been done by using the existing score as well as accuracy function as given by the various researchers [5,6,16]. For instance, the score values computed by using score function [16] are given as S(A1)=S(A2)=0.35 and hence accuracy function are computed as H(A1)=H(A2)=0.65. On the other hand, by using novel accuracy function as proposed by Ye [5], the computed accuracy functions corresponding to A1 and A2 are M(A1)=M(A2)=0.15. Thus, it has been concluded that the existing score as well as accuracy function are invalid to rank the alternatives and hence none of them can find the best alternative among these two.As it has been observed from the above example that the existing score and accuracy functions as proposed by various researchers are invalid to rank the alternatives and hence unable to discriminate between the pairs of IVIFNs in terms of ranking. Thus, their is a need to pay more attention on this issue and to find the accurate score function for finding the best alternative among the feasible alternative. For handling this, a new generalized improved score (GIS) function has been proposed here by taking into the account of the degree of hesitation between the membership and non-membership functions of the IVIFSs.Definition 3.1Let A=<[a, b], [c, d]> be an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number, a generalized improved score function (GIS) of an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy value, based on unknown degree is defined as(2)GIS(A)=a+b2+k1a(1−a−c)+k2b(1−b−d),GIS(A)∈[0,1]where k1+k2=1, k1, k2≥0 represents the attitudinal characters of the GIS function, as it gives the weighted average of the hesitation degree between the membership and non-membership functions.Example 3.1In order to show the superiority for finding the best alternative among the given alternative by using a proposed score function, an illustrative example as given in Example 2.1 has been considered here. For this, the score value corresponding to A1 and A2 are computed for different pairs of the attitudinal parameters (k1, k2) ranging from 0 to 1 and their results are summarized in Table 1. From their corresponding results, it has been observed that with the increase of the parameter k1, the score function corresponding to IVIFS A1 and A2 are also increases and its gives the proper ranking between them for each pair of (k1, k2). Thus, based on the results it has been computed that A2≻A1. Therefore, it will be more reliable and preferable than the other existing score and accuracy functions where they are unable to discriminate between the pairs of IVIFNs.Definition 3.2Let ([a1, b1], [c1, d1]), ([a2, b2], [c2, d2]) be two interval valued numbers over [0,1]. A relation “≤” in D[0, 1] is defined as: ([a1, b1], [c1, d1])≤([a2, b2], [c2, d2]) iff a1≤a2, b1≤b2, c1≥c2 and d1≥d2.The following theorem gives the proof that the proposed score function gives a unique score function corresponding to each IVIFN.Theorem 3.1Let α1=([a1, b1], [c1, d1]) and α2=([a2, b2], [c2, d2]) be two IVIFNs with generalized improved score function GIS(α1) and GIS(α2), respectively. If α1≠α2then GIS(α1)≠GIS(α2).ProofAssume that α1=([a1, b1], [c1, d1]) and α2=([a2, b2], [c2, d2]) be two interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers such that α1≠α2. W.l.o.g, assume that α1<α2 i.e., a1<a2, b1<b2, c1>c2 and d1>d2 be such that S(α1)=S(α2) i.e., a1+b1−c1−d1=a2+b2−c2−d2. Now, a generalized improved score function for an arbitrary IVIFN α=([a, b], [c, d]) can be rewritten as follows.GIS(α)=a+b2+k1a(1−a−c)+k2b(1−b−d)=1+2k12a+1+2k22b−(k1a2+k2b2)−(k1ac+k2bd)=1+2k12(a+b)+(k2−k1)b−(a2+b2)k1−(k2−k1)b2−k1(ac+bd)−(k2−k1)bd=1+2k12(a+b)−(a+b)2k1+2abk1−k1(a+b)(c+d)−ad−bc+(k2−k1)b(1−b−d)=(a+b)1+2k12−k1(c+d)−k1(a+b)2+k1[a(b+d)+b(c+d)]+(k2−k1)b(1−b−d)Therefore,(3)GIS(α1)−GIS(α2)=(a1+b1)12+k11−c1−d1−(a2+b2)12+k11−c2−d2︸1st term+k1−(a1+b1)2+(a2+b2)2︸2nd term+k1a1(b1+d1)−a2(b2+d2)︸3rd term+k1b1(a1+c1)−b2(a2+c2)︸4th term+(k2−k1)b1(1−b1−d1)−b2(1−b2−d2)︸5th termAs a1<a2, b1<b2, ⇒a1+b1<a2+b2 and 1−c1−d1>0. Therefore,1st term<(a2+b2)12+k1(1−c1−d1)−(a2+b2)12+k1(1−c2−d2)<(a2+b2)(c2+d2−c1−d1)k12nd term=k1(a2+b2+a1+b1)(a2+b2−a1−b1)=k1(a2+b2+a1+b1)(c2+d2−c1−d1)|∵a1+b1−c1−d1=a2+b2−c2−d23rd term<a2(b1+d1−b2−d2)k14th term<b2(a1+c1−a2−c2)k15th term<b2(b2+d2−b1−d1)(k2−k1)Hence, Eq. (3) becomes,GIS(α1)−GIS(α2)<(a2+b2)(c2+d2−c1−d1)k1+k1(a2+b2+a1+b1)(c2+d2−c1−d1)+a2(b1+d1−b2−d2)k1+b2(a1+c1−a2−c2)k1+(k2−k1)(b2+d2−b1−d1)<k1a2(c2−c1)+b2(d2−d1)+a2(b1−b2)+b2(a1−a2)+(k2−k1)(b2−b1+d2−d1)<k1a2(c2−c1)+b2(d2−d1)+a2(b1−b2)+b2(a1−a2)+(k2−k1)(1−d2−b1+d2−d1)<k1a2(c2−c1)+b2(d2−d1)+a2(b1−b2)+b2(a1−a2)+(1−2k1)(1−b1−d1)As a1<a2, b1<b2, c1>c2, d1>d2 and k1, k2≥0, so k1[a2(c2−c1)+b2(d2−d1)+a2(b1−b2)+b2(a1−a2)]<0 and 1−b1−d1≤1. Therefore,GIS(α1)−GIS(α2)<1−2k1=<0ifk1≥1/2>0ifk1<1/2Therefore, if α1<α2 then GIS(α1)≠GIS(α2). Similarly the results hold for α1>α2. Hence, if α1≠α2 then GIS(α1)≠GIS(α2) while equality holds if and only if α1=α2 i.e., a1=a2, b1=b2, c1=c2 and d1=d2. This complete the proof. □The proposed score function for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers has the following properties:(i)Property 1: For any interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy subset A=<[a, b], [c, d]>, the generalized score function GIS(A)∈[0, 1].Property 2: (zero property:) If the IVIFN A=<[0, 0], [1, 1]> then GIS(A)=0.Property 3: (one property:) If the IVIFN A=<[1, 1], [0, 0]> then GIS(A)=1.Property 4: For a fuzzy subset A=<a, 1−a>, the generalized score function is GIS(A)=a.In this section, we propose a method for solving the multi-criteria decision making problems of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values with unknown attribute weights based on generalized improved score function defined in Eq. (2). Let A={A1, A2, …, Am} be a set of m alternatives and G={G1, G2, …, Gn} be set of n criteria and the information about attribute weights is completely unknown. The procedure for computing the MCDM is summarized in the following steps.Step 1:Construction of IVIF decision-making matrix: Suppose that Dm×n(xij)=([aij, bij], [cij, dij]) be the intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix, where [aij, bij] indicates the degree that the alternative Aisatisfies the attribute Gjgiven by the decision maker, [cij, dij] indicates the degree that the alternative Aidoes not satisfy the attribute Gjgiven by the decision maker, [aij, bij]⊂[0, 1], [cij, dij]⊂[0, 1], bij+dij≤1, i=1, 2, …, m;j=1, 2, …, n. Therefore, an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix is expressed as(4)Dm×n(xij)=([a11,b11],[c11,d11])([a12,b12],[c12,d12])⋯([a1n,b1n],[c1n,d1n])([a21,b21],[c21,d21])([a22,b22],[c22,d22])⋯([a2n,b2n],[c2n,d2n])⋮⋮⋱⋮([am1,bm1],[cm1,dm1])([am2,bm2],[cm2,dm2])⋯([amn,bmn],[cmn,dmn])Normalize the fuzzy decision matrix: Normalize each attribute value αij=([aij, bij], [cij, dij]) in the matrix D into a corresponding element in the matrixR=(rij)m×nwhere rij=Dij/max{D1j, D2j, …, Dmj} for i=1, 2, …, m and j=1, 2, …, n.Determination of the entropy matrix: Based on the proposed generalized improved score function given in Eq. (2), we convert the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixR=(rij)m×ninto the following score matrixE(eij)=(GIS(rij))m×n. Therefore, the IVIFS score matrix E of Aion Gjcan be written as under(5)E(eij)=GIS(r11)GIS(r12)…GIS(r1n)GIS(r21)GIS(r22)…GIS(r2n)⋮⋮⋱⋮GIS(rm1)GIS(rm2)…GIS(rmn)Determination of attribute weight: Since it has been noticeable that the final ranking order of alternatives highly depends on the attribute weights and hence the proper assessment of the attribute weights play a dominant role in the decision-making process. Based on the information acquisition, the attribute weights in the multiple-criteria decision making is classified as subjective as well as objective. The former ones are determined by preference information on the attributes as given by the decision-maker while the latter one are determined by the decision-making matrix. The Shannon entropy method is one of the most famous approach for determining the objective attribute weights, which express the relative intensities of attribute importance to signify the average intrinsic information transmitted to the decision maker. Thus, based on the entropy matrix, E(eij) defined in Eq. (5) the degree of divergence (dj) of the average intrinsic information provided by the correspondence, performance ratings on criteria Gjcan be defined as dj=1−κjwhereκj=∑i=1mE(eij),j=1,2,…,n. Here, the value of djrepresents the inherent contrast intensity of criterion Cj, and hence based on it, the attributes weightwj(j=1,2,…,n)corresponding to Gjcriteria is given as:(6)wj=dj∑j=1ndj=1−κj∑j=1n(1−κj)=1−κjn−∑j=1nκjConstruction of weighted intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix: After the construction of intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix and determining the weights of each attribute, the weighted intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix, expressed by ϑi=([ai, bi], [ci, di]) for Ai, (i=1, 2, …, m), is constructed using the generalized interval valued Intuitionistic fuzzy interactive weighted averaging (GIVIFIWA) operator, as defined in Eq. (1), as followϑi=GIVIFIWA(ϑi1,ϑi2,…,ϑin)=<[Ai,Bi],[Ci,Di]>whereAi=(1−∏j=1n(1−(1−cij)λ+(1−(aij+cij))λ)wj+∏j=1n(1−(aij+cij))λwj)1/λ−∏j=1n(1−(aij+cij)wj)Bi=(1−∏j=1n(1−(1−dij)λ+(1−(bij+dij)λ)wj+∏j=1n(1−(bij+dij))λwj)1/λ−∏j=1n(1−(bij+dij)wj)Ci=1−(1−∏j=1n(1−(1−cij)λ+(1−(aij+cij))λ)wj+∏j=1n(1−(aij+cij))λwj)1/λDi=1−(1−∏j=1n(1−(1−dij)λ+(1−(bij+dij))λ)wj+∏j=1n(1−(bij+dij))λwj)1/λThe parameter λ plays a regulatory role during the information aggregation process. Here we use the GIVIFIWA operator to aggregate all the individual decision matrices into the collective decision matrix by taking different values of λ: λ→0, λ=0.4, 0.8, 1, 2, 7, 10, 15, 25, 50.Compute score values: Calculate the scores of the overall collective intuitionistic fuzzy preference value ϑi, i=1, 2, …, m by using the score function given in Eq. (2), i.e.,GIS(ϑi)=Ai+Bi2+k1Ai(1−Ai−Ci)+k2Bi(1−Bi−Di)for different pairs of (k1, k2).Ranking the alternative: Finally, rank all the alternatives Ai(i=1, 2, …, m) and select the most desirable alternative accordance with descending order of their score function.In this section, two examples for multi-criteria fuzzy decision making problems of alternatives are used as a demonstration of the applications and the effectiveness of the proposed decision making method.The first example for decision-making problem has been taken from [5,12]. The aim of this problem is to make a decision for a panel who wants to invest the money in the four possible alternatives namely as car, food, company and arm company denoted by A1, A2, A3 and A4, respectively. The panel takes the decision according to the three criteria given by C1 is risk analysis; C2 is the growth analysis and C3 is the environmental impact analysis. These four possible alternative Ai(i=1, 2, 3, 4) are to be evaluated using the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information by the decision-maker under the above three criteria, as listed in the following decision matrix D4×3(xij).(7)D4×3(xij)=([0.4,0.5],[0.3,0.4])([0.4,0.6],[0.2,0.4])([0.1,0.3],[0.5,0.6])([0.6,0.7],[0.2,0.3])([0.6,0.7],[0.2,0.3])([0.4,0.7],[0.1,0.2])([0.3,0.6],[0.3,0.4])([0.5,0.6],[0.3,0.4])([0.5,0.6],[0.1,0.3])([0.7,0.8],[0.1,0.2])([0.6,0.7],[0.1,0.3])([0.3,0.4],[0.1,0.2])By using these decision matrix, the following generalized improved score matrix has been obtained by using Eq. (2) for the pair(k1,k2)=12,12as(8)E4×3(xij)=0.53500.58000.23500.71000.71000.68500.51000.60000.68000.82000.74000.5200Based on these constructed score matrix, the attribute weight vector corresponding to each attribute is obtained by using Eq. (6) as(9)ω1=0.3642;ω2=0.3769;ω3=0.2590By using these attribute weights, weighted intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix for Aiis constructed by using generalized interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy interactive weighted averaging operator asϑ1=〈[0.3336,0.4985],[0.3062,0.5015]〉;ϑ2=〈[0.5557,0.7000],[0.1907,0.3000]〉ϑ3=〈[0.4348,0.6000],[0.2571,0.4000]〉;ϑ4=〈[0.5836,0.6903],[0.1067,0.3097]〉Now, ranking of these different attributed are done by using the score function given in Eq. (2) for the weighted intuitionistic decision matrix ϑias(10)GIS(ϑ1)=0.4761;GIS(ϑ2)=0.6983;GIS(ϑ3)=0.5844;GIS(ϑ4)=0.7273Therefore, the ranking order of the four alternatives is A4≻A2≻A3≻A1 i.e., arms company ≻ food company ≻ computer company ≻ car company, and found that A4 (i.e., arms company) is the most desirable one while A1 (car company) is the least one. As the attribute weights are the most important parameter for the decision maker for accessing the best alternative. So, in order to compare the proposed results with the existing techniques [5,12,13,19], the corresponding approaches has been implemented here for the considered data with the attribute weights (ω1, ω2, ω3)=(0.3642, 0.3769, 0.2590). For instance, the score value obtained by using Ye [5] approach corresponding to each alternative is S(A1)=0.2011, S(A2)=0.4743, S(A3)=0.3333, S(A4)=0.4404 while these values by utilizing Bai [12] approach is S(A1)=0.4952, S(A2)=0.7050, S(A3)=0.5795, S(A4)=0.7152. Similarly, the score values 0.0469, 0.4092, 0.2189, 0.4704 are computed corresponding to Ai, (i=1, 2, 3, 4) alternative by using Xu [19] and Zhang et al. [13] approaches, respectively. Therefore, it has been concluded that the proposed results coincides with the ones shown in [5,12,13,19] i.e., A4 (i.e., arms company) is the most desirable one to be invest, and hence the proposed decision making method can be suitably utilized to solve the IVIF multiple and decision making problem with completely unknown attribute weights.On the other hand, the effects of different values of k1 and k2 on the ranking of the system has been analyzed and their corresponding score function along with their ranking order are summarized in Table 2. From this table it has been concluded that with the increase of k1 from 0 to 1 (or simultaneously decreasing the value of k2 from 1 to 0) the relative score of the attributes are increases but the overall ranking of the alternatives remain unaltered. Thus based on these different parameter values, system analysis or decision maker may possess the power to alter the ranks of the alternatives. Also, for analyzing the effect of the parameter λ on the most desirable alternatives of the given attributes, an experiment has been conducted by taking families of the parameter λ's, (λ→0, λ=0.4, 0.8, 1, 2, 10, 15, 25, 50) corresponding to the different values of (k1, k2). The corresponding improved score functions along with their ranking are derived for each alternative in each case and are listed in Table 3. From this table, it has been observed that for a parameter λ, the larger the parametric values, the larger is the degree of membership and smaller is the degree of non-membership. The same trend has also reflect in their score functions i.e., the score functions are gradually increases with an increase of λ. As far as the ranks of the alternatives are concerned, ranks are consistent when λ→0, λ=0.4, …, and indicates that A4 is the best choice and A1 is the relatively worse option. Dissimilarly, when λ=50, the best alternative becomes A2 instead of A4. Therefore, this analysis will helps the decision makers to alter their ranks with their preferences towards the alternatives.Consider the five alternatives Ai, i=1, 2, …, 5 which is to be evaluated by the decision maker according to the six different criteria Cj, (j=1, 2, …, 6). The decision matrix D5×6(xij) information related to these alternative under the set of the given criteria has been constructed in the form of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and are summarized in Table 4.By using the input data and Eq. (2), we convert the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix D5×6(xij) into the following score function E5×6(xij) for a pair (k1,k2)=12,12asE5×6(xij)=0.32000.71000.55500.82000.23500.67500.71000.68000.71000.77500.38000.68500.53500.82000.60000.74000.53500.54000.71000.70000.82000.52000.68000.82000.57000.43000.74000.79000.71000.6250Based on these constructed score matrix, the attribute weight, from Eq. (6), corresponding to each criteria is obtained as (ω1, ω2, …, ω6)=(0.1404, 0.1781, 0.1846, 0.2013, 0.1172, 0.1785). Finally, GIVIFIWA operator has been applied for aggregating the decision maker preferences by taking λ=1 and obtained their corresponding aggregation function values corresponding to each alternative as ϑ1=<[0.4868, 0.6221], [0.2210, 0.3779]>, ϑ2=<[0.5222, 0.6575], [0.1886, 0.3425]>, ϑ3=<[0.5142, 0.6322], [0.1927, 0.3678]>, ϑ4=<[0.5692, 0.6921], [0.1246, 0.3079]> and ϑ5=<[0.5255, 0.6571], [0.1901, 0.3429]>. Thus, based on these, the ranking of their weighted intuitionistic decision matrix ϑiare done by using the proposed score function as GIS(ϑ1)=0.6256, GIS(ϑ2)=0.6654, GIS(ϑ3)=0.6486, GIS(ϑ4)=0.7178 and GIS(ϑ5)=0.6661. Therefore, ranking of the five alternatives are observed as A4≻A5≻A2≻A3≻A1. Hence, A4 alternative is the most desirable one while A1 is the least one. On the other hand, the problem has been solved by using the existing approaches [5,12,13,19] corresponding to the same weight vector and found the score values corresponding to respective alternative Ai(i=1, 2, …, 5) are 0.6012, 0.6808, 0.6421, 0.6912, 0.6412 by Bai [12] approach, 0.3855, 0.3948, 0.3862, 0.4357, 0.4409 by Ye [5], 0.2778, 0.3748, 0.3335, 0.4562, 0.3330 by Zhang et al. [13] and Xu [19] approaches. Therefore, the proposed results coincides with the ones shown in [5,12,13,19] and hence the proposed decision making method can be suitably utilized to solve the IVIF MCDM problem.However, the effect of the different pairs of (k1, k2) on selecting the best alternative among the given criteria are computed by taking λ=1 and the corresponding score values along with ranking for finding the best and worst alternatives are summarized in Table 5. From this table it has been concluded that score function values are increases for each attribute with increase of value k1 but the overall ranking order remain preserved corresponding to λ=1. However, the effect of the families of parameter λ's on the decision making process has been analyzed by taking different values of λ's, (λ→0, λ=0.4, 0.8, 1, 2, 10, 15, 25, 50) for different pairs of (k1, k2). The results corresponding to it has been summarized in Table 6along with their ranking at each value of λ and pair (k1, k2). From this analysis, it has been observed that the most desirable attribute is A4 and A1 is the least one.
