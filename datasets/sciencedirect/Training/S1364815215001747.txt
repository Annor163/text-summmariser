@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Effective conservation planning relies on the accurate identification of anthropogenic land cover. However, accessing localized information can be difficult or impossible in developing countries. Additionally, global medium-resolution land use land cover datasets may be insufficient for conservation planning purposes at the scale of a country or smaller. We thus introduce a new tool, GE Grids, to bridge this gap. This tool creates an interactive user-specified binary grid laid over Google Earth's high-resolution imagery. Using GE Grids, we manually identified anthropogenic land conversion across East Africa and compared this against available land cover datasets. Nearly 30% of East Africa is converted to anthropogenic land cover. The two highest-resolution comparative datasets have the greatest agreement with our own at the regional extent, despite having as low as 44% agreement at the country level. We achieved 83% consistency among users. GE Grids is intended to complement existing remote sensing datasets at local scales.Grids is a web application written in Javascript using the Google Earth application programming interface (API), which is freely available from Google. The program requires a web browser, the Google Earth plug-in and internet connectivity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Land use land cover (LULC) datasets describe how humans use land (land use) as well as the physical features that cover the earth's surface (land cover). These datasets aid in the identification of the location, intensity, and extent of human activities which is essential to conservation planning (Hansen et al., 2000). In LULC datasets, anthropogenic land cover is typically classified as either cropland or urban extent. However, identification of these land uses is challenging and varies greatly across datasets (Vancutsem et al., 2012; Potere and Schneider, 2007; Fritz et al., 2011). Traditional remote sensing classification approaches require grouping spectral signatures and subsequent accurate discrimination between groups i.e. land cover types (Pfeifer et al., 2012). However, emerging remote sensing techniques, such as object-based classification reduce this reliance on unique spectral properties by allowing probabilistic class descriptions (Blaschke, 2010). Classification may be relatively easy where vegetated landscapes are homogenous and extensive e.g. some croplands. However, in heterogeneous landscapes with small, patchy agricultural fields, discriminating cropland from natural land cover using classification algorithms can be difficult (Tchuenté et al., 2011; Vancutsem et al., 2012).Furthermore, while the financial burdens of obtaining satellite image data are decreasing, generating remote sensing classification products still require specialized, and often expensive, training and software (Stensgaard et al., 2009; Pettorelli et al., 2014). Access to these resources may present particular hurdles to research and conservation programs, particularly those in developing countries. Error in selecting, downloading, processing, and analyzing remote sensing datasets may additionally result in inappropriate recommendations and conclusions (Watson et al., 2015), particularly for ecological applications (Kerr and Ostrovsky, 2003). Inappropriate analyses may result in missed opportunities, or squandered resources (Wilson et al., 2005). There is thus a need for easily created, inexpensive, locally-accurate datasets that can confidently be used in conservation planning (Watson et al., 2015).One possible solution to problems associated with the cost and difficulty of conducting remote sensing classification analyses and the accuracy of LULC datasets is to use free, easy to access, high-resolution image data (pixel resolution of 10 m or better; moderate resolution data is between 10 and 250 m (Pfeifer et al., 2012)) like that available through Google Earth. Google Earth is a free, easy-to-use program owned by Google Inc. that allows access to sub-meter pixel resolution data for over a quarter of the world's landmass and three-quarters of the global population (Google, 2014).Google Earth's high-resolution data are useful as a platform for validating datasets (Fritz et al., 2011) used previously with urban extent (Schneider et al., 2009) and land cover (Defourny et al., 2008). While Google Earth has the potential for wider use in scientific literature, particularly in LULC analyses (Potere, 2008), one prominent challenge is that native analysis functions in Google Earth are minimal (Yu and Gong, 2012), limited to drawing points, lines, and polygons. We previously used the polygon drawing feature to identify anthropogenic land use conversion in West Africa (Riggio et al., 2013) and Mozambique (Jacobson et al., 2013). The results were a significant improvement over existing datasets and aided in determining potential habitat. Although the time-consuming nature of these analyses limited further application, the success of the method spurred the creation of a new tool, “GE Grids”, to speed land cover class identification. GE Grids is the first free, customizable creator of raster datasets for use with Google Earth. GE Grids creates a user-defined, interactive grid (raster) overlaid on Google Earth image data. This tool circumvents expensive, specialized programs and knowledge, and enables easy use of Google Earth's high-resolution data to create localized datasets. We use GE Grids to document anthropogenic land conversion in East Africa, a region of significant conservation importance (Ray et al., 2005; Myers et al., 2000; Jenkins et al., 2013) experiencing rapid human population growth (UN, 2013).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Habitat loss via anthropogenic land conversion is a primary driver in biodiversity loss (Pimm et al., 2014). Therefore, identification of human-impacted areas is a critical first step in conservation planning and planning for ecological resilience (Baguette et al., 2013). Yet, existing global land cover datasets poorly and variably identify croplands and urban areas (Fritz et al., 2011; Fritz et al., 2010; Vancutsem et al., 2012). Improvements in the identification of these important areas are necessary. GE Grids can aid conservation purposes by pinpointing anthropogenic land cover and providing complementary data for existing LULC layers.An important difference between traditional LULC mapping and GE Grids is that this tool only produces a binary output as opposed to assigning multiple land cover classes. But when identifying a particular land cover type is very important, such as anthropogenic land cover, GE Grids can be a valuable complement and validation to existing datasets. Traditional remote sensing techniques require specialized knowledge and potentially expensive data and software (although this is changing), (Stensgaard et al., 2009; Pettorelli et al., 2014). Comparatively, GE Grids is a free, simple, transparent process that can quickly confirm results from more complicated analyses.
