@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the homologous genes studied, the exons and introns alternated in the same order in mouse and human. We studied, in both species: corresponding short segments of introns, whole corresponding introns and complete homologous genes. We considered the total number of nucleotides and the number and orientation of the SINE inserts. Comparisons of mouse and human data series showed that at the level of individual relatively short segments of intronic sequences the stochastic variability prevails in the local structuring, but at higher levels of organization a deterministic component emerges, conserved in mouse and human during the divergent evolution, despite the ample re-editing of the intronic sequences and the fact that processes such as SINE spread had taken place in an independent way in the two species. Intron conservation is negatively correlated with the SINE occupancy, suggesting that virus inserts interfere with the conservation of the sequences inherited from the common ancestor.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
This paper deals with some aspects of the structure of the introns of mouse and human mitochondrial solute carrier and cytokine receptor genes. The focus is a comparative study of the length and structure of introns and especially the integration of SINE sequences. Other aspects, such as the intronic splicing signals, will not be considered herein.The origin of viruses, whether independent or dependent on the onset of cellular life, has been the subject of different speculative hypotheses and according to a recent model a primordial pool of primitive genetic elements may have been the common ancestor of both cellular and viral genes (Koonin et al., 2006). However, considering the replication cycles, the present-day cells and viruses may be assigned to two different “empires”, as cells uniformly rely on cell division after the replication of their dsDNA while viruses (and related selfish agents) make use of several different genetic mechanisms and can only replicate inside a host living cell, relying on the biological machineries of the latter. As a consequence, viruses and their host cellular organisms were bound to co-evolve in a continued “arms race” between cells evolving immunological mechanisms to oppose the viral invasion and the viruses evolving responses that could subvert the cellular defenses (Koonin and Wolf, 2012). For example, the genes of some present-day dsDNA viruses, such as Herpes-, Pox-, and Irido-viruses, harbor coding cytokine-like and cytokine receptor-like sequences which, according to the current view, have been hijacked from mammalian hosts and contribute to increase the viruses potential to escape the host’s immune surveillance (Haig, 2001; Alcami, 2003; Liston and McColl, 2003; Holst and Rosenkilde, 2003; Panaro et al., 2006, 2010; Sharp et al., 2007; Beisser et al., 2008; Ouyang et al., 2013).Unlike dsDNA viruses, the genome of retroviruses is comprised of single-stranded RNA; following the penetration of a retrovirus in a host cell, its RNA is reverse-transcribed into DNA which is often integrated (through integrase) as dsDNA into introns of the nuclear genes of the cell. When germline cells are affected, the viral inserts are thereafter transmitted to the offspring in a Mendelian manner; furthermore, at least some segments of the virus-derived DNA behave as transposable elements (jumping genes) and become inserted in further germline cell genes, forming a pool of stable “endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)”, remnants of ancient infections by exogenous retroviruses. The retroviral origin of such sequences is established on the basis of the structural similarities with the present-day exogenous retroviruses (Khodosevich et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2003; Subramanian et al., 2011). However, the viral inserts in the host genome are often incomplete and over the long ages since integration, a period possibly varying from 100 to 25 MYA (million years ago), have been riddled with mutations disrupting the basic constitutive elements of the retroviral genome, namely the two long terminal repeats (LTRs) and the gag, pol, and env genes (Medstrand et al., 1997; Khodosevich et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2003). Thus, most ERVs are thought to be biologically inactive (junk DNA, decayed relics, fossil viruses) (Khodosevich et al., 2002; Nelson et al., 2003). However, it has been hypothesized that some ERVs could perform useful regulatory functions in the transcription of the neighboring host genes, through enhancers, promoters, hormone responsive elements, and polyadenylation signals; indeed, some ERVs still contain fully coding env genes and these are transcribed in several healthy tissues, including the placenta (Khodosevich et al., 2002; Koonin and Wolf, 2012). Other observations confirm the potential biological activity of the ERVs, as their insertion at specific sites may disturb the expression of other genes located even 100Kbp apart. For example, the insertion of the Avian Leukosis virus at a specific intronic situation determines the recessive white mutation in chickens (Chang et al., 2006, 2007). Intronic integration of Murine leukemia virus or human immunodeficiency virus type-1 has also been reported to bring about dysregulation in the expression of the genes involved or of other neighboring genes (Mack et al., 2003; Tsukahara et al., 2006; Panaro et al., 2009). The therapeutic insertion of coding genes carried by retroviral vectors (gene therapy) may result in some cases in a severe dysregulation of other genes neighboring the insertion site (Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., 2003; Themis et al., 2003; Takakuwa et al., 2004; Kustikova et al., 2005; Nienhuis, 2006). Furthermore, due to their residual pathogenicity, or their potential to dysregulate the expression of neighboring genes, some human ERVs of the K superfamily have been implicated in certain cancers and autoimmune diseases and even schizophrenia (Andersson et al., 1998; Subramanian et al., 2011). Finally, it has been suspected that ERV might re-activate from time to time, thus explaining the long periods of clinical latency of certain viral infections (Ikeda et al., 2007). In short, whatever the biological activity of present-day ERVs, it is likely that during evolution a strong pressure was exerted by viruses on positively selecting cells with the most efficient immune systems and by cells on positively selecting those viruses which had evolved more efficient strategies to escape the immune surveillance (Van Blerkom, 2003; Fosterer and Prangishvili, 2009; Stern and Sorek, 2011; Koonin and Wolf, 2012; Ouyang et al., 2013).Most introns and UTRs of human and mouse genes harbor SINE (Short INterspersed Element) sequences, preeminently the human (and primate) SINE Alu and the murine (and rodents) B1, both originally derived from the 7SL RNA and transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Deininger and Batzer, 2002; Jurka et al., 2007; Kriegs et al., 2007). The human SINE Alu (more than 106 copies, i.e., about 10% of the genome) (Abdurashitov et al., 2008) is ∼300bp long and is fundamentally composed of two tandemly repeated 7SL-derived units joined by a short intermediate segment and followed by another terminal short sequence with a poly-A tail; the mouse SINE B1 (∼145bp long; about 7% of the genome) is composed of only one 7SL-derived unit followed by a terminal sequence similar to the SINE Alu terminal sequence (http//sines.eimb.ru/) (Tsirigos and Rigoutsos, 2009; Vassetzky and Kramerov, 2013). The general structure of mouse and human SINEs, including the positions of the CG dinucleotides, is shown in a diagram by Ichiyanagi (Ichiyanagi, 2013; Fig. 2).SINEs are unable to retropose autonomously (non-autonomous transposons) and are thought to borrow the enzymatic machinery required for their amplification (reverse transcriptase and endonuclease) from their “partner” autonomous retroposon LINE (Long INterspersed Element) L1 (Salem et al., 2005; Kramerov and Vassetzky, 2005; Ichiyanagi, 2013). Due to certain structural characteristics L1 has also been suggested to share a common origin with retroviruses (Krebs et al., 2014) and indeed, SINE Alu sequences often flank human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) of different classes, e.g., H HERV-H/env60 (AJ289710), XA34 (U29659), XA38 (U37066), and HERV-K (Y17832).Despite their simple structure SINEs are now thought to be, at least potentially, active in modulating, through their content of transcription factor binding sites, the expression of genes involved in some cellular functions, such as DNA repair, RNA splicing, and chromatin remodeling (Tsirigos and Rigoutsos, 2009; Polak and Domany, 2006; Häsler and Strub, 2006; Deininger, 2011; Ichiyanagi, 2013).Although similar in origin, SINE Alu and SINE B1 are believed to have been introduced independently in the ancestors of human and mouse after the divergence of primates and rodents, i.e., 100–65 MYA according to different estimates (Nei et al., 2001). Despite this, some general analyses have suggested that both viral inserts occur more frequently at corresponding groups of genes in mouse and human (Waterston et al., 2002; Polak and Domany, 2006; Tsirigos and Rigoutsos, 2009).In this paper, by studying in more detail the mouse/human correlations at different levels of structural organization, from segments of introns to whole introns and complete genes, we will endeavor to discriminate between the stochastic and the conserved deterministic components during the process of mouse and human speciation.
