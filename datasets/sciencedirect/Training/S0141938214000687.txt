@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Dysprosium doped di-strontium magnesium di-silicate namely Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was prepared by the solid state reaction method. The phase structure, surface morphology, particle size, elemental analysis was analyzed by using XRD, TEM, EDX and FTIR techniques. The EDX and FTIR spectra confirm the present elements in Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. The optical properties of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor was investigated utilizing thermoluminescence (TL), photoluminescence (PL), long lasting phosphorescence and mechanoluminescence (ML). Under the ultraviolet excitation, the emission spectra of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor are composed of a broad band and the characteristic emission of Dy3+ peaking at 470nm (blue), 575nm (yellow) and 678nm (red), originating from the transitions of 4F9/2→6H15/2, 4F9/2→6H13/2 and 4F9/2→6H11/2. CIE color coordinates of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ are suitable as white light emitting phosphor. Decay graph indicate that this phosphor also contains fast decay and slow decay process. The peak of ML intensity increases linearly with increasing impact velocity of the moving piston. The possible mechanism of this white light emitting long lasting phosphor is also investigated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the last few decades, as a new generation of phosphors, rare earth doped alkaline earth silicates and aluminates have been proposed and developed for various display and signing applications because of their application in traffic signs, emergency exit routes, decoration, and textile printing, among others. Compared with the conventional sulfide materials used earlier, silicates and aluminates long afterglow phosphors yield much better characteristics, such as a longer duration time of the phosphorescence, brighter luminosity, improved chemical stability along with relatively easier preparation and lower cost [1–3]. Colors of the newly developed long lasting phosphors cover from blue to red. However, no phosphors with white light long afterglow has been developed into a commercial application so far, while white light is the most suitable for illuminating light sources. In traditional phosphors industry, the white color phosphors can be obtained through the combination of the available phosphors with the three primary colors, red, green and blue [4–6]. Recently, a novel method of achieving white light long afterglow phosphors was conceived and reported by two groups from China. Lei et al. firstly reported the white light emitting long afterglow phosphors CdSiO3:Dy3+[7,8] and SrSiO3:Dy3+[9]. Then Liu et al. studied the white persistent luminescence of CaAl2O4:Dy3+[10] and Y2O2S:Tb3+[11]. In all these materials, the white light long afterglow emission is achieved via the combination of different color emissions from an identical luminescence centre, Dy3+ or Tb3+. For instance, the two main groups of emission lines of Dy3+ are in the wavelength range 470–500nm (blue) and 570–600nm (yellow), corresponding to the 4F9/2→6H15/2 and the 4F9/2→6H13/2 transitions respectively. The two color light emissions can produce white light through an appropriate combination in Dy3+ doped materials. Because the afterglow decay process is largely controlled by the properties of traps in the host, the different color emissions from the identical centre will have the same decay process, thus keeping the afterglow color unchanged.In the present paper, we report the synthesis of dysprosium doped di-strontium magnesium di-silicate (Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+) phosphor by high temperature solid state reaction method. This paper reports the structural characterization on the basis of XRD, TEM, EDX and FTIR analysis and studies of optical properties are also done on the basis of thermoluminescence (TL), photoluminescence (PL), long afterglow (decay) and mechanoluminescence (ML) properties.The dysprosium doped di-strontium magnesium di-silicate (Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+) phosphor was prepared by the high temperature solid state reaction method. The starting materials are strontium carbonate [SrCO3 (99.90%)], magnesium oxide [MgO (99.90%)], silicon di-oxide [SiO2 (99.99%)] and dysprosium oxide [Dy2O3 (99.99%)] all of analytical grade, were employed in this experiment. Boric acid [H3BO3 (99.90%)] was added as flux. Initially, the raw materials were weighed according to the nominal compositions of Sr2MgSi2O7:Dy3+ phosphor. Then the powders were mixed and milled thoroughly for 2h using the mortar and pestle. The grinded sample were placed in an alumina crucible and subsequently fired at 1050°C for 3h in air and at last the nominal compounds were obtained after the cooling down of the programmable furnace.The powder X-ray diffraction pattern has been obtained by Bruker D8 advanced X-ray powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and the data were collected over the 2θ range 10–80°. The phase structure of the sample was verified with the help of Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standard Data (JCPDS) file (JCPDS: 75-1736) and average crystallite size was calculated using the Debye Scherrer formula (D=kλ/βcosθ). The grain size of prepared phosphor was determined by TEM using TECHNAI G2. The samples required for TEM analysis were prepared by dispersing the sintered phosphor in methanol using an ultrasound bath technique. A drop of this dispersed suspension was put onto 200-mesh carbon coated copper grid and then dried into the air. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) was used for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the prepared phosphor. FTIR spectra were recorded with the help of IR Prestige-21 by SHIMADZU for investigating the finger print region (400–1400cm−1) as well as the functional group region (1400–4000cm−1) of sintered phosphor in middle infrared region (400–4000cm−1) by mixing the sample with potassium bromide (KBr). TL glow curves were recorded with the help of TLD reader 1009I by Nucleonix (Hyderabad, India Pvt. Ltd.). In the TL study, the mass of the sample was fixed (8mg), and every time takes the fresh sample for observation. The PL excitation and emission spectra were measured by a spectrofluorophotometer (SHIMADZU, RF-5301 PC) using the xenon lamp as excitation source. The decay curves were obtained using a Perkin Elmer fluorescent spectrometer with the proper excitation under a UV lamp (365nm). The ML measurement was observed by the home made lab system comprising of an RCA-931A photomultiplier tube (PMT). The ML glow curve can be plotted with the help of SM-340 application software installed in a computer attached with the storage oscilloscope. All measurements were carried out at the room temperature.
