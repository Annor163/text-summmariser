@&#ABSTRACT@&#
SettingThe infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis gives a delayed immune response, measured by the tuberculine skin test. We present a new technique for evaluation based on automatic detection and measurement of skin temperature due to infrared emission.Design34 subjects (46.8±16.9 years) (12/22, M/F) with suspected tuberculosis disease were examined with an IR thermal camera, 48h after tuberculin skin injection.ResultsIn 20 subjects, IR analysis was positive for tuberculine test. Mean temperature of injection area was higher, around 1°C, for the positive group (36.2±1.1°C positive group; 35.1±1.6°C negative group, p<0.02 T test for unpaired groups).ConclusionIR image analysis achieves similar estimation of tuberculin reaction as the visual evaluation, based on higher temperature due to increased heat radiation from the skin lesion.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
According to the World Health Organization, two billion people are infected with the tuberculosis (TB) bacilli [1], and it is estimated that every year eight million new cases appear. TB is a contagious disease not totally under control with great differences between rich and poor countries [2]. The diagnosis of TB is based on the interpretation of a skin immunologic reaction. The infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis gives a delayed immune response, measured by the tuberculin skin test (TST) [3]. This consists of the intradermal injection of tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) and measurement of the resulting reaction. The induration size, measured in millimeters, indicates if the test result is negative or positive. Palpation and pen methods have been typically applied to measure the PPD reaction, but the measurement depends on the subjective interpretation of the reaction area [4,5]. New technologies are currently being developed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the TB diagnosis [6].In this study, we present a new technique for the evaluation of the tuberculine reaction based on the automatic detection and measurement of infrared (IR) emission of inflammatory effects produced by tuberculine immune response. IR thermal imaging is a noninvasive technique for monitoring temperatures and is widely applied in medicine [7,8]. The IR radiation increases due to inflammatory processes, such as that in the tuberculine reaction. An increased IR radiation is most likely caused by elevated blood flow, metabolic activity, and inflammatory reactions [9]. Therefore IR thermal imaging can be used to measure the rise in temperature due to an inflammatory process, which causes the increase of the blood flow with vascular dilatation, blood proteins and cellular extravasations [10]. PPD inflammatory response is characterized by edema, leukocyte lymphocyte-mononuclear infiltration, and erythrocyte extravasation in the dermis and epidermis [11]. Our hypothesis in the present work was that intradermal inflammatory PPD reaction produced an increase in the temperature of the injected area, which can be measured by IR thermal imaging, and the features extracted from the resulting IR images after applying digital image processing techniques helped to improve the reliability in the TB diagnosis.
