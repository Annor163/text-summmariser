@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper treats an M/G/1 retrial queue with non-persistent customers, where the server is subject to failure due to the negative arrivals. After a completion of a service or a repair, the server searches for the customers in the orbit or remains idle. By using embedded Markov chain technique and the supplementary variable method, we present the necessary and sufficient condition for the system to be stable and the joint queue length distribution in steady state. The waiting process is also given. Some main reliability measures, such as the availability, failure frequency, and the reliability function of the server, are obtained. Finally, some numerical examples and cost optimization analysis are presented.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
During last two decades, retrial queues have been investigated extensively due to their applications in various fields, such as telephone switching systems and call centers and telecommunication networks with retransmission. The characteristic of retrial queueing systems is that customers who find all servers and waiting positions occupied may join an unpleasant pool (called retrial orbit) and retry for service after a period of time (called retrial time). About detailed overviews of the related literatures on retrial queues, readers are referred to the books of Falin and Templeton (1997) and Artalejo and Gómez-Corral (2008) and the survey papers of Artalejo (1999, 2010). Most of the literature on retrial queues assumes that after completion of each service the server will remain idle in the system until the arrival of the next primary or retrial customer. But in real life, we always want to minimize the idle time of the server and minimize the holding costs. So it is necessary to study the retrial queue with orbital search. That is, after completion of each service, the server may actively search the customer from the orbit. Then a service is followed by another service if a search is made, otherwise a service is followed by an idle period. So far seldom research work on retrial queue with orbital search has been done, readers are referred to Artalejo, Joshua, and Krishnamurthy (2002), Dudin, Krishnamoorthy, Joshua, and Tsarenkov (2004), Krishnamoorthy, Deepak, and Joshua (2005), Chakravarthy, Krishnamoorthy, and Joshua (2006), Wang (2006), Zhang and Wang (2012), Deepak, Dudin, Joshua, and Krishnamoorthy (2013) and references therein. In this paper we will introduce the orbital search policy into the M/G/1 retrial queue with negative customers and impatient customers.Recently, queues with negative customers (also called G-queues) have attracted considerable interests due to their extensive applications, such as computer, communication networks and manufacturing systems. Negative customers have been regarded as virus, inhibitor signals, operation mistakes, or system and server disaster in neural and computer communication network. Studies on G-queues can go back to Gelenbe (1989, 1991). Some typical killing strategies according to which a negative arrival removes positive customers from the system are as follows: (i) removal of customer from the head (RCH); (ii) simultaneously removal of all the customers (DST); and (iii) removal of customer from the end (RCE). About detailed studies on G-queues, the readers are referred to Artalejo (2000), Artalejo and Economou (2004), Atencia and Moreno (2004), Bocharov and Vishnevskii (2003), Do (2011), Wang, Liu, and Li (2008), Wang, Huang, and Dai (2011), and references therein.Non-persistent (or impatient) phenomenon of customers in queueing models often occurs. There are many situations where the customers may be impatient, such as impatient telephone switchboard customers and the hospital emergency rooms handling critical patients. Three terminologies are employed in queueing system to characterize customers’ impatient behaviors: (i) balking (customers decide not to join the line at all if he finds the server is unavailable upon arrival); (ii) reneging (customers leave the queue if they have waited too long for service); and (iii) jockeying (customers switch between queues if they think they will get served faster by so doing). Many retrial queues with impatient customers have attracted more attentions, for example, Artalejo and Lopez-Herrero (2000) considered an M/G/1 retrial queue with balking. Aguir, Karaesmen, Aksin, and Chauvet (2004) and Artalejo and Pla (2009) modelled a call center as the M/M/m retrial queue with exponential impatience times. Wang and Li (2008) presented an M/G/1 retrial queue with general retrial times, Bernoulli vacation, setup times and two-phase service, in which the customers are allowed to both balk and renege. Shin and Choo (2009) considered an M/M/s retrial queue with balking and reneging, in which the authors assumed that probabilities that the balking customers and reneging customers join orbit may depend on the number of customers in service facility. Wu, Brill, Hlynka, and Wang (2005) studied an M/G/1 retrial queue with general retrial times and unreliable server, in which customers may balk or renege sometimes and the server may break down because of the limitation of the server’s life time which is exponentially distributed. Krishnamoorthy et al. (2005) considered an M/G/1 retrial queue with non-persistent customers and orbital search. Recently, Wu, Wang, and Liu (2013) presented a discrete-time Geo/G/1 retrial queue with preferred customers and impatient customers. However, to the best of authors’ knowledge, there is no published literature on M/G/1 retrial queue combining negative customers, breakdown, impatience and orbital search.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the system description. Section 3 presents the stable condition of the system, steady-state analysis including the joint distribution of the orbit size and the server state at a random epoch and some system characteristics. In Section 4, we study the distribution of the waiting time in the orbit of any positive customer. Section 5 focuses on the reliability indexes of the system. In Section 6, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the features of our model. Section 7 presents the cost optimization analysis.In this section, we consider a single server retrial queue with orbital search and two types of independent arrivals, positive and negative. Assume that positive customers (primary customers) and negative customers arrive at the system according to two independent Poisson processes, with ratesλandδ, respectively. If an arriving positive customer finds the server idle, the customer obtains service immediately. Otherwise an arriving positive customer who finds the server unavailable (busy or under repair) will join the retrial orbit with probabilityβ(according to FCFS discipline) or leave the system with complementary probabilityβ¯(=1-β). The service times of positive customers follow an arbitrary distribution with distribution function (d.f.)B(x), probability density function (p.d.f.)b(x), finite first two momentsμ1,μ2.If an arriving negative customer finds the server being busy with a positive customer, it not only pushes out the customer being served from the system, but also breaks the server down. If the breakdown occurs, the server is sent for repair immediately. Repair times are assumed to be arbitrary distributed with d.f.G(x), p.d.f.g(x), finite first two momentsγ1,γ2. The server is as good as new after repair. The negative customer will vanish and has no effect on the system if the server is idle or is under repair upon its arrival. At the completion of a service or a repair, the server searches for the customer in the orbit (if any) with probability p or remains idle with complementary probabilityp¯(=1-p). The search time is assumed to be negligible.We assume that only the customer at the head of the retrial queue is allowed to attempt to reach the server. Then measured from the instant the server becomes idle, an external potential primary customer and a retrial customer compete to reach the server. The attempt time of the retrial customer (called retrial time) is generally distributed with d.f.R(x), p.d.f.r(x). This retrial policy is called general retrial and it was first considered by Gómez-Corral (1999). The retrial customer possibly give up his attempt when an external positive arrives first and with probability q will return to his position of the retrial queue or with complementary probabilityq¯(=1-q)leave the system.We assume that all the random variables defined above are independent.Throughout the rest of the paper, for a d.f.F(x), we defineF‾(x)=1-F(x)to be the tail ofF(x),F∼(s)=∫0∞e-sxdF(x)the Laplace–Stieltjes transform ofF(x)andF‾∗(s)=∫0∞e-sxF‾(x)dxto be the Laplace transform of functionF‾(x). Obviously, we can obtain thatF‾∗(s)=1-F∼(s)s.Define the functionsμ(x),ν(x),α(x)as the conditional completion rates for service, for repair and for retrial attempt respectively, i.e.,μ(x)=b(x)B‾(x),ν(x)=g(x)G‾(x),α(x)=r(x)R‾(x).In this section, we will investigate the stability condition of the system by using embedded Markov chain technique and derive some steady state distributions of the system by using supplementary variable method.LetSBbe the generalized service time interval of a positive customer from the epoch that he begins his service to the epoch when either he is served completely and thus departs the system or the possible repair (caused by the arrival of a negative customer) is completed, that is the server is ready for the next service, and letASBbe the number of customers that enter into the retrial queue duringSB. The probability generating function ofASBis denoted asA(z)≜∑k=0∞zkak=∑k=0∞zkP(ASB=k), and we defineS^B(s)=E[e-sSB]to be the Laplace transform ofSB. Denotea(k,t)dt=P(t<SB⩽t+dt,ASB=k),ã(z,s)=∑k=0∞zk∫0∞e-sta(k,t)dt.Then we havea(k,t)=e-βλtk!e-βλt(e-δtb(t)+δe-δtB‾(t)*g(t)),where∗denotes convolution. After some algebra calculations, we haveã(z,s)=B∼(s+δ+βλ(1-z))+δG∼(s+βλ(1-z))B‾∗(s+δ+βλ(1-z)).HenceS^B(s)=ã(1,s)=B∼(s+δ)+δG∼(s)B‾∗(s+δ),A(z)=ã(z,0)=B∼(δ+βλ(1-z))+δG∼(βλ(1-z))B‾∗(δ+βλ(1-z))=S^B(βλ(1-z)),A′(1)=dA(z)dzz=1=βλ(1+δν1)B‾∗(δ)≜ρ,A″(1)=d2A(z)dz2z=1=B‾∗(δ)(βλ)2(2ν1+2/δ+δν2)+2B∼′(δ)(βλ)2(1/δ+ν1).LetTk(T0=0)be the kth generalized service completion epoch at which the kthSBis completed,Nk=N(Tk)be the number of customers in the orbit at the timeTk, then the process{Nk,k⩾0}is a Markov chain with state spaceN, and we have the following theorem.Theorem 1The Markov chain{Nk,k⩾0}is ergodic if and only if the inequalityρ<1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))holds.From the assumptions of our model, the one-step transition probabilities are given as follows:P(Nk+1=n|Nk=m)=ak,m=0,n⩾0,[p+p¯(R∼(λ)+q¯R∼(λ))]a0,m>0,n=m-1,[p+p¯(R∼(λ)+q¯R∼(λ))]an-m+1+p¯q(1-A∼(λ))an-m,m>0,n>m-1,0,otherwise,whereak=∫0∞a(k,t)dt.Obviously, the Markov chain{Nk,k⩾0}is irreducible and aperiodic. And the mean driftxm=E[Nk+1-Nk|Nk=m]=ρ,m=0,ρ-(1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))),m>0.Then from Foster’s criterion (which states that an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain is ergodic if there exists a non-negative test functionf(m),m∈N, andε>0such that the mean driftxm=E[f(Nk+1)-f(Nk)|Nk=m]is finite for allm∈Nandxm⩽-ε, except perhaps a finite number of m. In our case, we consider the functionf(m)=m), we know that the inequalityρ<1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))is a sufficient condition for the system to be stable.The same inequality is also the necessary condition for ergodicity. Assume thatρ⩾1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ)), which implies thatxm⩾0for allm⩾0. Furthermore, according to the one-step transition probabilities, we know that the down driftDm=∑n<m(n-m)P(Nk+1=n|Nk=m)=0,m=0,-[p+p¯(R∼(λ)+(1-q)R∼(λ))]a0,m>0,which implies that the Markov chain{Nk,k⩾0}satisfies Kaplan’s condition namely if the sequence{Dm,m⩾0}is bounded below. Thus the Markov chain{Nk,k⩾0}is not ergodic, and then the necessity of the ergodicity is proven. □By the description of the model, we know that at time t, the state of the system can be described by the Markov processX(t)={N(t),J(t),ξ0(t),ξ1(t),ξ2(t)},(t⩾0), whereN(t)denotes the orbit size (i.e. the number of customers in the retrial orbit) at timet,J(t)represents the server state, defined as followsJ(t)=0,theserverisidleattimet,1,theserverisbusyattimet.2,theserverisunderrepairattimet.WhenJ(t)=0andN(t)>0,ξ0(t)is the elapsed retrial time; whenJ(t)=1,ξ1(t)is the elapsed service time; whenJ(t)=2,ξ2(t)is the elapsed repair time.Since the primary positive arrival stream is a Poisson process, from Burke’s theorem that the steady state probabilities of the Markov processX(t)={N(t),J(t),ξ0(t),ξ1(t),ξ2(t)}exist and are positive if and only if the embedded Markov chain{Nk,k⩾0}is ergodic. Therefore, the inequalityρ<1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))is a sufficient and necessary condition for the system to be stable. LetX={N,J,ξ0,ξ1,ξ2}be the stationary limit of the Markov processX(t)={N(t),J(t),ξ0(t),ξ1(t),ξ2(t)}.Define the following joint state probability and state probability densities:p0,0(t)=P(N(t)=0,J(t)=0),pk,0(t,x)dx=P(N(t)=k,J(t)=0,x<ξ0(t)⩽x+dx),k⩾1,pk,j(t,x)dx=P(N(t)=k,J(t)=j,x<ξj(t)⩽x+dx),k⩾0,j=1,2.If the system is stable, then we definep0,0=P(N=0,J=0)=limt→∞P(N(t)=0,J(t)=0),pk,0(x)dx=P(N=k,J=0,x<ξ0⩽x+dx)=limt→∞P(N(t)=k,J(t)=0,x<ξ0(t)⩽x+dx),k⩾1,pk,j(x)dx=P(N=k,J=j,x<ξj⩽x+dx)=limt→∞P(N(t)=k,J(t)=j,x<ξj(t)⩽x+dx),k⩾0,j=1,2.By the method of the supplementary variable, we easily obtain the system of equilibrium equations:(1)λp0,0=∫0∞p0,1(x)μ(x)dx+∫0∞p0,2(x)ν(x)dx,(2)ddxpk,0(x)=-(λ+α(x))pk,0(x),k⩾1,(3)ddxpk,1(x)=-(βλ+δ+μ(x))pk,1(x)+(1-δk,0)βλpk-1,1(x),k⩾0,(4)ddxpk,2(x)=-(βλ+ν(x))pk,2(x)+(1-δk,0)βλpk-1,2(x),k⩾0,whereδk,0is the Kronecker’s symbol. The boundary conditions are(5)pk,0(0)=p¯∫0∞pk,1(x)μ(x)dx+∫0∞pk,2(x)ν(x)dx,k⩾1,(6)pk,1(0)=δk,0λp0,0+(1-δk,0)λq∫0∞pk,0(x)dx+λq¯∫0∞pk+1,0(x)dx+∫0∞pk+1,0(x)α(x)dx+p∫0∞pk+1,1(x)μ(x)dx+p∫0∞pk+1,2(x)ν(x)dx,k⩾0,(7)pk,2(0)=δ∫0∞pk,1(x)dx,k⩾0,and the normalization condition isp0,0+∑k=1∞∫0∞pk,0(x)dx+∑k=0∞∫0∞(pk,1(x)+pk,2(x))dx=1.With the help of the generating functionsP0(x,z)=∑k=1∞zkpk,0(x), andPj(x,z)=∑k=0∞zkpk,j(x),j=1,2, from Eqs. (2)–(4), we have(8)P0(x,z)=P0(0,z)exp{-λx}R‾(x),(9)P1(x,z)=P1(0,z)exp{-(δ+βλ(1-z))x}B‾(x),(10)P2(x,z)=P2(0,z)exp{-βλ(1-z)x}G‾(x),and then by (1), (5)–(7), we can obtain(11)P0(0,z)=p¯P1(0,z)B∼(δ+βλ(1-z))+p¯P2(0,z)G∼(βλ(1-z))-p¯λp0,0,(12)zP1(0,z)=λ(z-p)p0,0+(1+q(z-1)(1-R∼(λ)))P0(0,z)+pP1(0,z)B∼(δ+βλ(1-z))+pP2(0,z)G∼(βλ(1-z)),(13)P2(0,z)=δP1(0,z)B‾∗(δ+βλ(1-z)).Combining (11)–(13), and lettingD(z)=(1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ)))(1-z)A(z)-z(1-A(z)), we arrive at(14)P0(0,z)=p¯λz(1-A(z))D(z)p0,0,(15)P1(0,z)=λ(1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ)))(1-z)D(z)p0,0,(16)P2(0,z)=δB‾∗(δ+βλ(1-z))λ1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))(1-z)D(z)p0,0.Applying the normalization condition, we obtainp0,0+∫0∞P0(x,1)dx+∫0∞(P1(x,1)+P2(x,1))dx=1,and by using (8)–(10) and (14)–(16), we can arrive at(17)p0,0=1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))-ρ[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]1+ρβ-ρ(p+p¯R∼(λ)).Now we summarize the above results in following theorem.Theorem 2Under the stationary conditionρ<1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ)), the generating functions of the stationary joint distribution of the orbit size and the server state are given by:p0,0=1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))-ρ[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]1+ρβ-ρ(p+p¯R∼(λ)),P0(x,z)=p¯λz(1-A(z))D(z)exp{-λx}R‾(x)p0,0,P1(x,z)=λ1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))(1-z)D(z)exp{-(δ+βλ(1-z))x}B‾(x)p0,0,P2(x,z)=δB‾∗(δ+βλ(1-z))λ1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))(1-z)D(z)exp{-βλ(1-z)x}G‾(x)p0,0.Next we focus on the marginal generating functions of the orbit size and the server states given in the following corollary.Corollary 1(1)The marginal generating function of the orbit size when the server is idle but the system is not empty isP0(z)=∫0∞P0(x,z)dx=p¯λz(1-A(z))D(z)R‾∗(λ)p0,0.The marginal generating function of the orbit size when the server is busy isP1(z)=∫0∞P1(x,z)dx=λ1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))(1-z)D(z)B‾∗(δ+βλ(1-z))p0,0.The marginal generating function of the orbit size when the server is under repair isP2(z)=∫0∞P2(x,z)dx=δB‾∗(δ+βλ(1-z))G‾∗(βλ(1-z))λ(1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ)))(1-z)D(z)p0,0.(1)The generating function of the orbit size,P(z), is given byP(z)=p0,0+P0(z)+P1(z)+P2(z)=N(z)D(z)p0,0β,whereN(z)=[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))][1-(β¯+βz)A(z)]-β(p+p¯R∼(λ))z(1-A(z)).The generating function of the system size,Φ(z), is given byΦ(z)=p0,0+P0(z)+zP1(z)+P2(z)=P(z)+(z-1)P1(z).From above results, we can get some performance measures of the system in steady state.Corollary 3(1)The probability that the server is idle but the system is not empty, denote byP0, is given byP0=P0(1)=p¯(1-R∼(λ))ρ[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]1+ρβ-ρ(p+p¯R∼(λ)).The probability that the server is busy, denote byP1, is given byP1=P1(1)=λ[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]B‾∗(δ)[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]1+ρβ-ρ(p+p¯R∼(λ)).The probability that the server is under repair, denote byP2, is given byP2=P2(1)=λ[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]B‾∗(δ)[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]1+ρβ-ρ(p+p¯R∼(λ))δν1.The mean orbit size,Lq, is given byLq=P′(1)=N″(1)2N′(1)-D″(1)2D′(1),whereD′(1)=ρ-[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))],D″(1)=2ρp¯q(1-R∼(λ))+A″(1);N′(1)=ρ(β-1+p¯(q-β)(1-R∼(λ)))-β[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))],N″(1)=-2ρβp¯q¯(1-R∼(λ))+(β-1+p¯(q-β)(1-R∼(λ)))A″(1).The mean system size,Ls, is given byLs=Φ′(1)=Lq+P1(1).In this section, we discuss the distribution of the randomWq, which denotes the waiting time in the orbit of any tagged arriving customer. LetW^q(s)be the Laplace transform ofWq, that is,W^q(s)=E[e-sWq], then we have the following result.Theorem 3If the system is stable, the Laplace transform ofWqis given byW^q(s)=1-β(P1+P2)+βλQ(s)1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))(1-S^B(s)Q(s))D(S^B(s)Q(s))(I(s)+II(s))p0,0,whereI(s)=B∼(s+δ)-B∼(δ+βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s))-s1-δG∼(s)s+δ+δG∼(s)δ+sB‾∗(δ+βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s))),II(s)=δB‾∗(δ+βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))G∼(s)-G∼(βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s))-s,Q(s)=p+p¯R∼(s+λ)+p¯q¯λR‾∗(s+λ)1-p¯qλS^B(s)R‾∗(s+λ).By conditioning on the system’s state when the tagged customer arrives, we have thatW^q(s)=p0,0+P0+(1-β)(P1+P2)+β∑k=0∞∫0∞pk,1(x)E[e-sWq|N=k,J=1,ξ1=x]dx+β∑k=0∞∫0∞pk,2(x)E[e-sWq|N=k,J=2,ξ2=x]dx=1-β(P1+P2)+β(ϕ1(s)+ϕ2(s)),where(18)ϕ1(s)=∑k=0∞∫0∞pk,1(x)E[e-sWq|N=k,J=1,ξ1=x]dx,(19)ϕ2(s)=∑k=0∞∫0∞pk,2(x)E[e-sWq|N=k,J=2,ξ2=x]dx.If k customers are already in the retrial orbit and the server is busy or under repair when the tagged customer arrives and decides to join the orbit, thenWqis equal toWr∗+Wq(k+1), whereWr∗denotes the residual generalized service time of the positive customer being served or the residual repair time of the server being repaired spends in the system from the instant the primary customer arrives, andWq(k+1)represents the total waiting time of the tagged customer in the retrial queue from the instant the positive customer being served leaves the system or the instant the server being repaired completes its repair. Then we obtain that(20)E[e-sWq|N=k,J=1,ξ1=x]=E[e-sWr∗|N=k,J=1,ξ1=x]E[e-sWq(k+1)],(21)E[e-sWq|N=k,J=2,ξ2=x]=E[e-sWr∗|N=k,J=2,ξ2=x]E[e-sWq(k+1)].Using the well-known formulasPy<ξ1r⩽y+dy|ξ1★>x=b(x+y)dyB‾(x),Py<ξ2r⩽y+dy|ξ2★>x=g(x+y)dyG‾(x),whereξ1★andξ2★denote the service time and repair time, respectively;ξ1randξ2rdenote, respectively, the residual service time and residual repair time, we have(22)E[e-sWr∗|N=k,J=1,ξ1=x]=∫0∞b(x+y)B‾(x)e-δye-sydy+∫0∞b(x+y)B‾(x)∫0yδe-δte-stG∼(s)dtdy=1B‾(x)∫x∞b(u)e-(s+δ)(u-x)du+G∼(s)B‾(x)δδ+s∫x∞b(u)(1-e-(s+δ)(u-x))du,(23)E[e-sWr∗|N=k,J=2,ξ2=x]=∫0∞g(x+y)G‾(x)e-sydy=1G‾(x)∫x∞g(u)e-s(u-x)du.By the assumptions of our model, we know that(24)E[e-sWq(k+1)]=S^B(s)E[e-sWq(1)]kE[e-sWq(1)],whereWq(1)is the waiting time in the retrial orbit of the customer at the head of the retrial orbit, from the instant the customer being served leaves the system or the instant the server being repaired completes its repair. Taking the orbital search policy into consideration, we arrive atQ(s)≜E[e-sWq(1)]=p+p¯∫0∞e-λte-str(t)dt+∫0∞r(t)∫0tλe-λxe-sx(q¯+qS^B(s)Q(s))dxdt=p+p¯R∼(s+λ)+p¯(q¯+qS^B(s)Q(s))λR‾∗(s+λ),which yieldsQ(s)=p+p¯R∼(s+λ)+p¯q¯λR‾∗(s+λ)1-p¯qλS^B(s)R‾∗(s+λ).Substituting the above into (24) leads to(25)E[e-sWq(k+1)]=(S^B(s))k(Q(s))k+1.Combining (18)–(23) and (25), with the help of (15) one can obtain that(26)ϕ1(s)=Q(s)∫0∞P1(x,S^B(s)Q(s))B‾(x)∫x∞b(u)e-(s+δ)(u-x)du+δG∼(s)δ+s∫x∞b(u)(1-e-(s+δ)(u-x))dudx=Q(s)P1(0,S^B(s)Q(s))∫0∞e-(δ+βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))x∫x∞b(u)e-(s+δ)(u-x)du+δG∼(s)δ+s∫x∞b(u)(1-e-(s+δ)(u-x))dudx=Q(s)P1(0,S^B(s)Q(s))B∼(s+δ)-B∼(δ+βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s))-s1-δG∼(s)s+δ+δG∼(s)δ+sB‾∗(δ+βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))=λQ(s)(1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ)))(1-S^B(s)Q(s))D(S^B(s)Q(s))B∼(s+δ)-B∼(δ+βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s))-s1-δG∼(s)s+δ+δG∼(s)δ+sB‾∗(δ+βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))p0,0.Similarly, we can obtain(27)ϕ2(s)=δλQ(s)(1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ)))(1-S^B(s)Q(s))D(S^B(s)Q(s))G∼(s)-G∼(βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s))-s×B‾∗(δ+βλ(1-S^B(s)Q(s)))p0,0,which completes the proof of Theorem 3.□From Theorem 3, we can getE[Wq]=-ddsW^q(s)s=0.In this section, based on the results obtained above, we present some important reliability indexes of the queueing model. It is should be noted that in the queueing literature, Wang, Cao, and Li (2001) studied repairable M/G/1 retrial queueing models from the viewpoint of reliability for the first time, both of the queueing indices and reliability characteristic are obtained. Wang (2006) investigated the reliability of the M/G/1 retrial queue with general retrial times and server breakdowns. Later on, Wang et al. (2008) considered the transient queueing and reliability analysis of an M/G/1 retrial queue subject to disasters and server failures. In this paper we develop the reliability analysis of our model along this line.LetA(t)be the pointwise availability of the server at time t, that is, the probability that the server is either in idle period or serving a customer. Suppose that the system is stable, and letA=limt→∞A(t)be the steady state availability of the server. Then by usingA=1-P2we can readily obtain the following result.Theorem 4The steady state availability of the server isA=1-λ[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]B‾∗(δ)[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]1+ρβ-ρ(p+p¯R∼(λ))δν1.The steady-state failure frequency of the server isWf=δλ[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]B‾∗(δ)[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]1+ρβ-ρ(p+p¯R∼(λ)).ByWf=δ∑k=0∞∫0∞pk,1(x)dx, we can easily getWf=δP1=δλ[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]B‾∗(δ)[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))]1+ρβ-ρ(p+p¯R∼(λ)). □Assuming that the system is empty at initial timet=0and the server is idle, i.e.,p0,0(0)=1. Letτbe the time to the first failure of the server, then the reliability function of the server isU(t)=P(τ>t). For the Laplace transform ofU(t)denoted byU∗(s)=∫0∞e-stU(t)dt,Res(s)>0, we have the following theorem.Theorem 6The Laplace transform ofU(t)is given byU∗(s)=1s+λ(1+U0(s))+U1(s)R‾∗(s+λ)+U2(s)B‾∗(s+δ),whereU0(s)=λς(s)F(s,ς(s))-λς(s),U1(s)=p¯((1+U0(s))(s+λ-λB∼(s+δ))-(s+λ))F(s,1)B∼(s+δ)-(s+λ),U2(s)=(F(s,1)-λ)(1+U0(s))-F(s,1)F(s,1)B∼(s+δ)-(s+λ)F(s,z)=p(s+λ)+p¯(λ(q¯+qz)+(s+λq(1-z))R∼(s+λ))),|z|≤1,ς(s)is the minimum absolute value root of the equationF(s,z)B∼(s+δ+βλ(1-z))-z(s+λ)=0in the unit circle andRes(s)>0.To findU(t), we consider a new queueing system where the failure states of the server are absorbing states. For the new system, using the same notations as in Section 3.2, we can get the following set of differential equations:ddt+λp0,0(t)=∫0∞p0,1(t,x)μ(x)dx,∂∂t+∂∂x+λ+α(x)pk,0(t,x)=0,k⩾1,∂∂t+∂∂x+βλ+δ+μ(x)pk,1(t,x)=(1-δk,0)βλpk-1,1(t,x),k⩾0,pk,0(t,0)=p¯∫0∞pk,1(t,x)μ(x)dx,k⩾1,pk,1(t,0)=δk,0λp0,0(t)+(1-δk,0)λq∫0∞pk,0(t,x)dx+λq¯∫0∞pk+1,0(t,x)dx+∫0∞pk+1,0(t,x)α(x)dx+p∫0∞pk+1,1(t,x)μ(x)dx,k⩾0,with the initial conditionp0,0(0)=1.Taking Laplace transforms of these equations leads to(28)(s+λ)p0,0∗(s)=1+∫0∞p0,1∗(s,x)μ(x)dx,(29)spk,0∗(s,x)+∂∂xpk,0∗(s,x)=-(λ+α(x))pk,0∗(s,x),k⩾1,(30)spk,1∗(s,x)+∂∂xpk,1∗(s,x)=-(βλ+δ+μ(x))pk,1∗(s,x)+(1-δk,0)βλpk-1,1∗(s,x),k⩾0,(31)pk,0∗(s,0)=p¯∫0∞pk,1∗(s,x)μ(x)dx,k⩾1,(32)pk,1∗(s,0)=δk,0λp0,0∗(s)+(1-δk,0)λq∫0∞pk,0∗(s,x)dx+λq¯∫0∞pk+1,0∗(s,x)dx+∫0∞pk+1,0∗(s,x)α(x)dx+p∫0∞pk+1,1∗(s,x)μ(x)dx,k⩾0.Define the generating functions of these Laplace transforms as followsP0∗(s,x,z)=∑k=1∞zkpk,0∗(s,x),P1∗(s,x,z)=∑k=0∞zkpk,j∗(s,x).It follows from (29) and (30), we have(33)P0∗(s,x,z)=P0∗(s,0,z)e-(s+λ)xR‾(x),(34)P1∗(s,x,z)=P1∗(s,0,z)e-(s+δ+βλ(1-z))xB‾(x).Further using (31) and (32), one can obtain that(35)P0∗(s,0,z)=p¯P1∗0(s,0,z)B∼(s+δ+βλ(1-z))-p¯(s+λ)p0,0∗(s)-1,(36)zP1∗(s,0,z)=λzp0,0∗(s)+λ(q¯+qz)P0∗(s,0,z)R‾∗(s+λ)+P0∗(s,0,z)R∼(s+λ)+pP1∗(s,0,z)B∼(s+δ+βλ(1-z))-(s+λ)p0,0∗(s)+1.DenoteF(s,z)=p(s+λ)+p¯(λ(q¯+qz)+(s+λq(1-z))R∼(s+λ))), it follows from (35) and (36), we have(37)P1∗(s,0,z)=(s+λ)(F(s,z)-λz)p0,0∗(s)-F(s,z)F(s,z)B∼(s+δ+βλ(1-z))-z(s+λ).By Rouché’s theorem, the denominator of (37) has exactly one zeroz=ς(s)inside the unit circle which is also the zero point for the numerator of (37). After algebra calculations, we obtainp0,0∗(s)=1s+λ1+λς(s)F(s,ς(s))-λς(s),substituting the above into (37), we have(38)P1∗(s,0,z)=(F(s,z)-λz)1+λς(s)F(s,ς(s))-λς(s)-F(s,z)F(s,z)B∼(s+δ+βλ(1-z))-z(s+λ).Then from (35), one has that(39)P0∗(s,0,z)=z1+λς(s)F(s,ς(s))-λς(s)(s+λ(1-B∼(s+δ+βλ(1-z))))-z(s+λ)F(s,z)B∼(s+δ+βλ(1-z))-z(s+λ).LettingUi+1(s)=limz→1Pi∗(s,0,z)=Pi∗(s,0,1),i=0,1,F∗(s)=F(s,1)=λ+s(p+p¯R∼(s+λ)), then we can calculate the Laplace transform ofU(t)as followsU∗(s)=∫0∞estU(t)dt=p0,0∗(s)+∫0∞P0∗(s,x,1)+P1∗(s,x,1)dx=p0,0∗(s)+P0∗(s,0,1)R‾∗(s+λ)+P0∗(s,0,1)B‾∗(s+δ)=1s+λ(1+U0(s))+U1(s)R‾∗(s+λ)+U2(s)B‾∗(s+δ),which completes the proof of Theorem 6. □From Theorem 6 we can obtain the mean time to first failure(MTFF)of the server given byMTFF=U∗(0).Based on the results obtained in previous sections, in this section we shall present some numerical examples by varying the values of parametersδ,β,pand q, which are chosen to satisfy the stationary condition, to illustrate the characteristics of the model considered in this paper.Example 1We assume that the service time, repair time and retrial time follow the exponential distributions with parametersμ,νand r, respectively. Here we takeμ=4,ν=6,r=3andλ=5. Numerical results are reported in Tables 1–4.We assume thatλ=5, the service time follows the phase type distributionPH(α,T)withα=(0.3,0.7),T=-3.5830.5530.365-6.865,the repair time follows exponential distribution with mean1/8, and retrial time follows the Erlang(2,6) distribution, i.e., Erlang of order 2 with mean1/3. Numerical results are shown in Figs. 1–4.From Table 1 and Fig. 1, we can see that because the negative arrival can not only remove the customer being served, but also cause the server to breakdown, then given the repair rate fixed, the probabilities that the server is idlep0,0+P0, under repairP2, and the failure frequencyWfincrease monotonously, the probabilityP1that the server is busy, the availability of the server A and the obit sizeLqall decrease monotonously, which agree with our expectations.In Table 2, the values ofβsuch that the stable condition0<β<1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))λ(1+δν1)B‾∗(δ)≈0.582397and in Fig. 2,0<β<1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))λ(1+δν1)B‾∗(δ)≈0.705796. Table 2 and Fig. 2 show that if the system is stable, asβ(the probability that the positive joins orbit at the arrival instant when they find the server is unavailable) increases,P1,P2,Wf,Lqtend to increase monotonously,p0,0+P0and A tend to decrease.From Fig. 3 we can observe that as the orbit search probability p increases, the probability that the server is busy increases monotonously and the orbit sizeLqdecreases monotonously, which are agree with our expectations. Because the busy probability increases and the negative arrival can make the server failure and repair, so the probability that the failure frequencyWfand the server is under repair increase monotonously as a function of p, which leads to A to decrease.In Table 4 and Fig. 4, we present the values of some performance measures when we vary the values of q such that the system is stable, that is, in Table 40⩽q<1-ρp¯(1-R∼(λ))≈0.630658and in Fig. 40⩽q<1-ρp¯(1-R∼(λ))≈0.888364. Table 4 and Fig. 4 show that as functions ofq,P1,P2,WfandLqall increase monotonously andp0,0+P0,Adecrease monotonously. However, the effect of q onLqis more obvious than on other performance measures.In order to carry out cost analysis we firstly need to develop a cycle of the system for the model under consideration. LetE1be the expected length of the period that starts at the epoch when an arriving positive customer finds that the system is empty and the server is idle and ends at the service completion epoch or the repair completion epoch at which the server becomes idle and the system is empty, and letE00be the expected length of the period that the server becomes idle and the orbit is empty. Then the expected length of a cycle C is given byE(C)=E00+E1. It is obvious thatE0,0=1λ. By applying the argument of an alternating renewal process, we havep0,0=E00E(C),which leads toE(C)=E00p0,0=[1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))](1+ρβ)-ρ(p+p¯R∼(λ))λ(1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))-ρ).Next we develop a steady state total expected cost function per unit time for the M/G/1-G retrial queue with orbital search and non-persistent customers, in which orbital search probability p is a decision variable. With the cost structure being considered, the objective is to determine the optimum value of p, so as to minimize the expected operating cost function per unit time.Define the following cost elements:Ch≡unittimecostofeverycustomerinthesystem;C0≡unittimecostforkeepingtheserveridle;C1≡unittimecostforkeepingtheserverbusy;C2≡unittimerepaircostforabrokenserver;CS≡setupcostpercycle.Based on the definitions of each cost element listed above, the total expected cost function per unit time is given by(40)TC(p)=ChLs+C0(p0,0+P0)+C1P1+C2P2+CS1E(C).The cost minimization problem can be illustrated mathematically asminpTC(p)subject to the stationary conditionρ<1-p¯q(1-R∼(λ))and0⩽p≤1. Because the total expected cost function per unit time is highly non-linear and complex, we cannot easily get the derivatives of it. Hence in the following two examples with assumptions thatCh=20,C0=30,C1=450,C2=550,CS=90andλ=5,δ=4.55,q=0.4,β=0.55, we develop approximations by Matlab program to find the optimum value of p, sayp∗.Example 1We assume that the service time, repair time and retrial time follow the exponential distributions with parametersμ=7,ν=25andr=5, respectively. Fig. 5(a) shows the curve of the cost function with the change of p for the M/M/1-G retrial queue.We assume that the service time follows the phase type distributionPH(α,T)withα=(0.3,0.7),T=-3.5830.5530.365-6.865,the repair time follows exponential distribution with mean1/8, and retrial time follows the Erlang(2,6) distribution, i.e., Erlang of order 2 with mean1/3. Fig. 5(b) shows the curve of the cost function with the change of p for this M/PH/1-G retrial queue.From Fig. 5, we can see that there is an optimal orbital search probability p to make the cost minimize. Implementing the computer software MATLAB by the parabolic method and the error is controlled byε=10-6, in Example 1 we find the solutionp∗=0.373668withTC(p∗)=341.2360, and in Example 2p∗=0.561173withTC(p∗)=358.1264.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we consider a repairable M/G/1 queue with negative customers and orbital search, allowing balking and reneging respectively for arriving and retrial positive customers. For this model, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the system to be stable. By using the supplementary variables method, we obtain the stationary queueing indexes and reliability measures of interest. We also present some numerical examples to study the effect of some key parameters on the characteristics of the model. Finally, a cost optimization problem is considered. This queueing system can model many practical problems that the servers are not always available for serving the customers. Such retrial queueing system can be used to model call centers, telecommunication networks, telephone switching system, etc. For further future research, one can consider batch arrival retrial queue with orbital search and second optional service under Bernoulli vacation, in which the orbital search time cannot be negligible.
