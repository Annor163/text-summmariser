@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper considers single-component repairable systems supporting different levels of workloads and subject to random repair times. The mission is successful if the system can perform a specified amount of work within the maximum allowed mission time. The system can work with different load levels, each corresponding to different productivity, time-to-failure distribution, and per time unit operation cost. A numerical algorithm is first suggested to evaluate mission success probability and conditional expected cost of a successful mission for the considered repairable system. The load optimization problem is then formulated and solved for finding the system load level that minimizes the expected mission cost subject to providing a desired level of the mission success probability. Examples with discrete and continuous load variation are provided to illustrate the proposed methodology. Effects of repair efficiency, repair time distribution, and maximum allowed time on the mission reliability and cost are also investigated through the examples.total amount of work in the missionmaximal possible number of repairs during the missionmaximum allowed mission timemission success probabilityconditional expected cost of successful missionconditional expected mission time given that the mission succeeds after j repairsevent when the jth failure happens at time Tjand the system spends time Xjin operation mode before the failurejoint distribution function of random values Tjand Xjprobability that jth failure happens in time interval v and the system spent in operation mode w intervals before the failurerandom repair time for systemminimal and maximal possible realizations of Dproductivity of system working with load level Lpdf of time-to-failure distribution of system working with load level Lcdf of time-to-failure distribution of system working with load level Lpdf of repair timecdf of repair timenumber of discrete intervals considered in the numerical algorithmduration of a discrete time interval: Δ = τ/mnumber of time intervals needed to complete the mission if no failures occurfloor operation that returns the maximal integer not exceeding xevent when the mission is completed after j repairsPr(Yj)scale, shape parameters of Weibull time-to-failure distribution for load level Lper time unit repair costper time unit operation cost under load level Lrepair efficiency coefficient

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Empirical studies have demonstrated that the workload applied to a system component can have a great impact on the component's failure behavior, productivity, as well as operation cost (Amari, Misra & Pham, 2008; Iyer & Rosetti, 1986; Kapur & Lamberson, 1977). Consequently, the success probability and cost of mission involving a specified amount of work to be accomplished by the system components are also dependent on the component load levels. Therefore, for systems supporting different levels of component workloads, the optimal loading problem arises where the expected mission cost is minimized subject to providing a certain level of system reliability. In this paper, we solve the optimal loading problem for repairable systems with a single component that can function at different loads or productivity levels and is subject to a random repair time every time it fails.A repairable system is a system that can be restored to some fully satisfactory performance through maintenance actions (e.g., part adjustment or replacement) after failing to function correctly (Ascher & Feingold, 1984; Lindqvist, 2006; Yang, Zhang, & Hong, 2013). Based on the degree to which the operating condition of a system is restored through the maintenance, three categories or levels of repair models can be identified: perfect repair, general/imperfect repair, and minimal repair (Lindqvist, 2006; Yañez, Joglar, & Modarres, 2002). A perfect repair restores a system to an “as good as new” condition; a minimal repair restores the system to an “as bad as old” condition, i.e., to the same state as it was immediately before its failure; a general repair can bring the system to any condition between the former two cases.Considerable research efforts have been dedicated to analyzing and optimizing single-component and multi-component repairable systems under those different repair models. The commonly used techniques for modeling the failure process or reliability of a repairable system include, for example, renewal processes (particularly homogeneous and non-homogeneous Poisson processes) (Saldanha, de Simone, & Frutuoso e Melo, 2001; Weckman, Shell, & Marvel, 2001), Markov chains (Bloch-Mercier, 2001, 2002; Marquez & Heguedas, 2002; Soro, Nourelfath, & Aït-Kadi, 2010), geometric processes (Castro & Pérez-Ocón, 2006; Jia & Wu, 2009; Lam, 1988; Zhang & Wang, 2007), and Bayesian methods (Percy, 2002; Rosqvist, 2000; Sheu, Yeh, Lin, & Juang, 2001). Different types of optimization problems have also been formulated and solved for repairable systems with different maintenance policies or behaviors. For example, the replacement policy optimization problems have been addressed for repairable systems subject to waiting repair times (Jia & Wu, 2009a), with repairman who can take multiple vacations (Jia & Wu, 2009b; Yuan & Xu, 2011), or under free-repair warranty (Yeh, Chen, & Lin, 2007). The optimal periodic and non-periodic inspection scheme problems have been solved for repairable systems subject to hidden failures or interactions between hard and soft failures (Golmakani & Moakedi, 2012a, 2012b, 2013; Taghipour & Banjevic, 2011, 2012, Taghipour, Banjevic, & Jardine, 2010). In (Yeh & Lo, 2001), a joint optimization problem has been solved for repairable systems to determine the optimal number and schedule of preventive maintenance actions as well as the corresponding maintenance degrees. In (Monga & Zuo, 1998), the optimal maintenance and warranty policy have been addressed for repairable systems considering all phases of the system life cycle, where the optimal burn-in period, optimal preventive maintenance intervals and optimal replacement times are determined.Despite the rich literature on modeling and optimization of repairable systems, to the best of our knowledge, none of those works have considered the optimal loading problem. As indicated at the beginning of this section, solutions to the optimal loading problem can facilitate planning of a mission operation with the minimum expected mission cost while satisfying a certain level of mission success probability. In this work we make the novel contributions by formulating and solving the component load optimization problem for single-component repairable systems, which support multiple different levels of workloads and have random failure and repair times. The proposed methodology is flexible and general to accommodate different levels of repair models (perfect, imperfect, and minimal) as well as arbitrary types of component time-to-failure and repair time distributions.The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the system model as well as the load-failure and load-productivity relationship models. The formulation of the load optimization problem is also given. Section 3 presents the evaluation of mission success probability and conditional expected cost of successful mission for single-component repairable systems subject to random repair times. Section 4 presents the numerical evaluation algorithm. Section 5 presents two illustrative examples. Impacts of repair efficiency, repair time distribution parameters, and the maximum allowed mission time on the mission success probability and conditional expected cost are investigated. Section 6 concludes the paper and gives directions of future work.The system should perform an amount of work W within a fixed mission time τ. It can work with different load levels. Each load level L corresponds to a different system productivity gLand time-to-failure distribution determined by the cumulative distribution function (cdf) FL(t). When the system fails, the repair/replacement procedure starts immediately. The repair time depends on external factors such as availability and efficiency of the repair manpower and equipment and is randomly distributed in the interval [dmin, dmax]. cdf Ψ(t) of the repair time distribution is known. We assume that if the system has operated time t0 before the repair, its time-to-failure distribution after the repair has cdf FL(zt0+t), where z is the repair efficiency coefficient that can vary from 0 (the system after repair is as good as new, which corresponds to the replacement by a brand new system or perfect repair) to 1 (the system is as bad as old, which corresponds to the minimal repair). The per time unit repair cost of the system cris fixed. The per time unit operation cost of the system co(L) depends on the load level L.There exist different models to represent the relationship between the load and the failure behavior of a system, such as the accelerated failure-time model (AFTM) (Levitin & Amari, 2009; Nelson, 1990; Pike, 1966) and proportional-hazard model (PHM) (Cox, 1972; Kumar & Klefsjo, 1994). For example, in the widely applied AFTM model the effect of the system load is multiplicative in time and the reliability and failure functions for a system with load L can be respectively expressed asRL(t)=R0(tϕ(L)),FL(t)=F0(tϕ(L)),where R0(.) and F0(.) are the baseline reliability and failure functions of the system. Two common forms of the load factor function φ(L) have been used:ϕ(L)=Lα(referred to as the power law) andϕ(L)=eLα(referred to as the exponential law) (Levitin & Amari, 2009). In this work we adopt the most general case where the failure function, i.e., cdf of the time-to-failure distribution FL(t) can be different for a different load level L.The performance or productivity of a system gLis also dependent on the applied load L. In general, gLis considered as a function that maps the load to the corresponding productivity. The function can take any form (Levitin & Amari, 2009). For example, gLcan be a linear function for a pipe carrying fluid in a laminar flow mode where the productivity, i.e., throughput of the pipe is proportional to the load (i.e., pressure) on the pipe. gLcan appear as a nonlinear function for a pipe carrying fluid in a turbulent flow mode where the pressure on the pipe and the volume of the flow exhibit non-linear relationship.We assume that for any load level L, the time W/gLneeded to complete the mission is less than the maximal allowed mission time τ. The productivity that does not meet this requirement cannot provide the mission success and should not be considered. Given the mission is completed, the maximal possible number of failures (repairs) during the mission is N =⌊(τ−W/gL)/dmin⌋ because the system must operate during time W/gLto fulfill the mission and, thus, the time remaining for the repairs is τ−W/gL.Based on the load-failure and load-productivity models reviewed above or experimental data, the corresponding values of system productivity gLas well as parameters of failure time distribution FL(t) can be obtained for a particular system load L. In this paper we assume they are given as input parameters. Further the productivity-dependent system operational cost (per time unit) co(L) is assumed to be given.Having the relationships of FL(t), gL, co(L) with L, one can find the mission success probability R(L) and the conditional expected mission cost given the mission succeeds C(L). The load optimization problem presumes finding the system load that minimizes the expected mission cost subject to providing a desired level R* of the mission success probability:(1)L=argminC(L)s.t.R(L)>R*.Let 〈Tj,Xj〉 be an event that the jth failure happens at time Tjfrom the mission beginning after spending time Xj≤Tjin the operation mode and time Tj−Xjin repair (see Fig. 1for illustration), and Qj(t,x) be the joint distribution function of the random values Tjand Xj. The event 〈Tj,Xj〉 corresponds to the initiation of a repair that takes random time D.For the first failure,(2)Q1(t,x)={fL(t)if(x=t),0≤t≤W/gL0otherwisebecause the system is switched off when the mission is completed after time W/gLof continuous operation i.e. T1 = X1 can vary from 0 to W/gL.For any j > 1 Xjcan vary from 0 (when the system fails j times immediately after the repair) to min (W/gL,τ − (j − 1)dmin) (when the system spends minimal time dmin in each of j − 1 repairs and fails immediately before the task completion or mission time expiration). For any realization of Xj, the time Tjcan vary from Xj+ (j − 1)dmin (when the system spends minimal time dmin in each of j − 1 repairs) to min(τ,Xj+ (j − 1)dmax) (when the system spends maximal time dmax in each of j − 1 repairs).The system can transit from event 〈Tj,Xj〉 to event 〈Tj+1,Xj+1〉 with Tj+1 ≥ Tj+dmin and Xj+1 ≥ Xj, where Xj= Xj+1 when it fails immediately after the j−1th repair. The transition 〈Tj,Xj〉→〈Tj+1,Xj+1〉 occurs when the system works time Xj+1 − Xjafter a repair that takes time D = (Tj+1 − Tj) − ( Xj+1 − Xj). As dmin ≤ D ≤ dmax, the condition(3)Tj+1+Xj−Xj+1−dmax≤Tj≤Tj+1+Xj−Xj+1−dminshould hold to make the transition possible.Having the functions Qj(t,x), ψ(t) and fL(t) one can recursively obtain the function Qj+1(t,x) for j = 1,…,N − 1 as(4)Qj+1(t,x)=∫0min(W/gL,τ−(j−1)dmin)∫max(x˜+(j−1)dmin,t+x˜−x−dmax)min(τ,x˜+(j−1)dmax,t+x˜−x−dmin)Qj(t˜,x˜)ψ(t−t˜−x+x˜)fL(zx˜+x−x˜)dt˜dx˜Qj+1(t,x)=0forx>min(W/gL,τ−jdmin),t<x+jdminort>x+jdmax.Consider, for example, the second failure (j = 2). Following (4) and (2), we getQ2(t,x)=ψ(t−x)∫0xfL(x˜)fL(zx˜+x−x˜)dx˜for x ≤ W/gL, t ≤ τ, x + dmin≤t ≤ x + dmax and Q2(t,x) = 0 otherwise. Indeed, before any event 〈T2,X2〉 with T2 = t, X2 = x only one repair with duration t − x happens (see Fig. 1). The probability that the repair takes time t − x is ψ(t − x). The first failure can happen at any time 0 ≤ X1 = T1 ≤ x. For any realization of the first failure timeX1=x˜the system operation time before the second failure isx−x˜. pdf of the times to the first and second failures are fL(x˜) and fL(zx˜+x−x˜) respectively.Let Yjbe the event that the system completes the mission task at time not exceeding τ given that exactly j failures happen during the mission. The entire mission success probability can be obtained as a sum of probabilities of mutually exclusive events Y0, Y1,…, YN.Without any failure (thus repair), the system needs time W/gLto complete the entire task. Thus(5)r0=Pr{Y0}=1−FL(W/gL).Given the event 〈Tj,Xj〉, the system can complete the remaining amount of work W−gLXjduring the time τ−Tj−D remaining after performing the repair, i.e. when(6)(W−gLXj)/gL=W/gL−Xj≤τ−Tj−Dif it does not fail during the time W/gL− Xj. It follows from inequality (6) that in the case of the mission success the repair time should not exceed τ - Tj− W/gL+ Xj.As D≥dmin, the greatest possible value of Tjwhen the task can be completed after the event 〈Tj,Xj〉 is τ+Xj−W/gL−dmin.Thus, having the distribution function Qj(t,x) and cdf Ψ(t) one can obtain rjfor j=1,…,N as(7)rj=∫0min(W/gL,τ−(j−1)dmin)∫x+(j−1)dminτ+x−W/gL−dminQj(t,x)(1−FL(zx+W/gL−x))Ψ(τ−t−W/gL+x)dtdx.The total mission success probability is(8)R=∑j=0Nrj.Assume that the mission is completed after failure event 〈Tj,Xj〉 i.e. the system undergoes the jth repair, which takes time D, and then succeeds to work without failures during the time W/gL−Xj, needed to complete the mission. In this case the total mission time is Tj+D+W/gL−Xj, the time spent in the operation is W/gLand the time spent in the repair mode during the entire mission is Tj+D−Xj. The expected mission repair time given j>0 failures happen during the mission is(9)θj=∫0min(W/gL,τ−(j−1)dmin)∫x+(j−1)dminτ+x−W/gL−dminQj(t,x)(1−FL(zx+W/gL−x))∫dminmin(dmax,τ−t−W/gL+x)ψ(y)(t−x+y)dydtdxThus, the conditional expected mission cost given the mission is completed can be obtained as(10)C=Rco(L)W/gL+cr∑j=1NθjR=co(L)W/gL+crR∑j=1Nθj.To obtain the mission success probability R and conditional expected cost C numerically, we divide the maximum allowable mission time τ into m equal intervals with duration Δ = τ/m such that for i = 0,…,m interval i begins at time iΔ and ends at time (i+1)Δ. The total number of time intervals needed to complete the mission if no failures occur is h = W/(gLΔ).Having cdf FL(t) for the cumulative time-to-failure of the system, one can obtain the probability that it operated k intervals before the repair and fail before operating i intervals after repair as FL*(k,i) = FL(Δ(kz+i)), and the probability that it operated k intervals before the repair and fails in the ith interval after the repair as fL*(k,i) = FL(Δ(kz+i+1)) −FL(Δ(kz+i)).The probability that the repair takes less than d intervals is Ψ*(d) = Ψ(Δd) and the probability that the repair takes d intervals can be obtained as ψ*(d) = Ψ*(d+1) −Ψ *(d). The minimal and maximal numbers of intervals that the repair can take are d*min = dmin/Δ and d*max = dmax/Δ respectivelyThe distribution function Qj(t,x) can be approximated by a discrete matrix qj(v,w) for v = 0,…,m − 1 and w = 0,…,h − 1 representing the probability that the jth failure occurs in time interval v and the system operated during w intervals before this failure.According to (2) q1(v,w) can be obtained using the following procedure:1For v = 0,…,m − 1:1.1For w = 0,…,h − 1: q1(v,w) = 0; q1(w,w) = f1*(0,v).Having qj-1(v,w) for j = 2,…,N, v = 0,…,m − 1 and w = 0,…,h − 1 one can obtain qj(v,w) using the following procedure based on (4).1Set qj(v,w) = 0 for v = 0,…,m − 1; w = 0,…,h − 1;For w = 0,…,m − 1:2.1For v = w + (j − 2)d*min,…,m − 1:2.1.1For d = d*min,…, d*max:2.1.1.1For i = 0,…, m − 1:2.1.1.1.1If(v + d + i < m) If(w + i < h)qj(v + d + i,w + i) = qj(v + d + i,w + i) + qj−1(v,w)ψ *(d)fL*(w,i);In the above pseudo-code d and i are the numbers of time intervals during which the system undergoes the (j − 1)th repair and operates after the repair, respectively, v is the index of time interval when the (j − 1)th failure happens and w is the number of intervals during which the system operated before the (j − 1)th failure.Having qj(v,w) for j = 1,…,N, v = 0,…,m − 1 and w = 0,…,h − 1 one can obtain rjand θjusing the following procedure based on (7) and (9).1Set rj= θ j= 0;For w = 0,…,h − 1:2.1f = h − w;For v = w + (j − 1)d*min,…,m − 1:2.2.1k = m − v − f;If(k ≥ d*min):2.2.2.1For d = d*min,…,min(k, d*max):2.2.2.1.1s = qj(v,w)(1 − FL*(w,f))ψ *(d);rj= rj+ s;θj= θj+ Δ(v − w + d)s;In the above pseudo-code f is the minimal number of intervals needed to complete the mission after the jth failure and k is the number of intervals remaining after the jth failure before the mission time expiration.Summarizing, the algorithm for evaluating the mission success probability and conditional expected cost of the system subjected to random repair times takes the following form.1Set qj(v,w) = 0 for j=1,…,N, v = 0,…,m − 1; w = 0,…,h − 1;SetR=1−FL(W/gL); θ = 0; q1(w,w) = f1*(0,w) for w = 0,…,h − 1;For j = 2,…,N + 1:3.1For w = 0,…,h − 1:3.1.1f = h − w;For v = w + (j − 2)d*min,…,m − 1:3.1.2.1For d = d*min,…, d*max:If (v + f + d < m)s = qj−1(v,w)(1 − FL*(w,f))ψ *(d); R = R + s; θ = θ + (v − w + d)s;For i = 0,…, m − 1:3.1.2.3.1If (v + d + i < m)If (w + i < h)qj(v + d + i,w + i) = qj(v + d + i,w + i)+qj−1(v,w)ψ*(d)fL*(w,i);C=co(L)W/gL+ΔcrθR.In this section two examples are analyzed to illustrate the proposed methodology. The impacts of the repair efficiency, repair time distribution parameters, as well as the maximum allowed mission time on the mission success probability and conditional expected cost are also investigated.Consider a mission with the amount of work W = 500 and maximum allowed time τ = 50. The mission should be performed by a system that can work with five different discrete load levels (L), characterized by the Weibull time-to-failure distribution with scale (ηL) and shape (βL) parameters presented in Table 1. The smaller value of L indicates a larger load on the system. With an increase in the load, the fatigue physics of the system can change causing more wear-out failures, which is indicated by β > 1 (ReliaSoft, 2002;Wilkins, 2002). At level L = 4 or 5 (corresponding to lower loads), β is equal to 1 implying that the system has a constant failure rate or is subject to mainly random failures.While different types of distributions have been used to model system time-to-failure and the numerical algorithm suggested in Section 4 has no limitation on the distribution types, the Weibull distribution is selected due to its broad application in the reliability area and its flexibility for modeling diverse failure rate behavior (Modarres, Kaminskiy, & Krivtsov, 2010; Weibull, 1951). The failure distribution parameters corresponding to the different loading conditions can be obtained using accelerated life testing analysis (Amari, Misra, & Pham, 2008; Nelson, 1990). Refer to (Levitin, Xing, Amari, & Dai, 2013) for a specific example of parameter estimation.Table 1 also presents the system operation cost (per time unit co(L)) and performance (or productivity gL) corresponding to each load level L. A smaller load (i.e., higher level L) implies a lower productivity of the system but a lower per time unit operation cost. The random repair time obeys a truncated normal distribution with dmin = 4, dmax = 10, μ = 6 (mean) and σ = 2 (standard deviation). The fixed per time unit repair cost is cr= 2.To investigate the impact of the number of considered intervals m on the accuracy of obtained results, values of R and C are obtained for the first load level (L = 1), repair efficiency coefficient z = 0.1 and different m ranging from 100 to 800. Fig. 2presents the values of R and C as functions of m.It can be seen that as the value of m increases, the estimates of R and C converge. For example, the difference between the results obtained for m = 100 and m = 800 is 2.9 percent for R and 0.3 percent for C. When comparing results obtained for m = 500 and m = 800, these differences lower to 0.24 percent and 0.025 percent respectively. Fig. 3presents the running time of the mission cost and success probability evaluation algorithm on Pentium 2 GHz PC as a function of m.The brute force approach is applied to solve the optimization problem (1) formulated in Section 2.3. Example solutions of the optimal system load levels for different allowed mission times τ and desired mission success probabilities R*are presented in Table 2.With an increase in the deadline τ, the mission success probability increases and the corresponding optimal conditional expected mission cost also increases. This result is also supported by Fig. 7. With more strict constraints on the desired mission success probability (i.e., larger values of R*), larger value of L (corresponding to smaller load and longer lifetime) tends to be optimal, implying greater mission success probability and more mission cost too.The suggested algorithm for mission success probability and conditional expected cost evaluation allows one to analyze the influence of the repair efficiency and repair time distribution parameters. Fig. 4presents R and C as functions of the repair efficiency coefficient z (the rest of parameters are unchanged).It can be seen that the mission success probability always decreases with the decrease of the repair efficiency (growth of z). C also decreases with growth of z because the less efficient repairs give less chance of mission success and, thus, the probability of successful mission scenarios that include repairs decreases, which reduces the conditional expected repair cost whereas the conditional expected operation cost does not depend on z. Observe that for L = 5 the value of z almost does not affect R and C because the system productivity is low, which allows not more than one repair to be performed and the probability of the mission success in the case of its failure/repair is very low.Fig. 5presents R and C as functions of the mean repair time μ (the rest of parameters are unchanged). The mission success probability always decreases with the increase in μ, whereas the conditional expected cost can behave non-monotonically.On one hand the increase in μ leads to the increase in mission cost, on the other hand the further increase of μ decreases the probability of mission success in the case of failures/repairs because the mission time is limited. When the system is heavily loaded and highly productive, the increase in mean repair time μ causes increase in the mission time, but the mission time still does not exceed τ. In this case the mission cost increases with μ. When the system has lower productivity, the increase in μ often leads to system inability to complete the mission in time. The mission can succeed only when less repairs are performed, which reduces the expected cost of the successful mission. Thus C(μ) becomes a decreasing function for low loads.Fig. 6presents R and C as functions of repair time variation index σ (the rest of parameters are unchanged).The system parameters can affect the behavior of functions R(σ) and C(σ). For example, for L = 5 the pure operation time needed to complete the mission is 45.5, which means that the repair time cannot exceed 4.5 in the case of the mission success. The mean time of any repair is 6, which means that when σ = 0, the mission can never be completed. The growth of σ increases the probability that repair time is less than 4.5 and, thus, increases the mission success probability. On the contrary, when L = 4 the pure operation time needed to complete the mission is 35.7, which means that the repair time cannot exceed 14.3 in the case of the mission success. When σ = 0, the mission can be completed after no more than two repairs (total repair time is 12). The decrease of the repair time from 6 to 4.8 (by 1.2) does not change the maximal possible number of repairs as (6−1.2) × 3 > 14.3, and the increase of the repair time by the same value makes the mission success possible only with one repair (6+1.2) × 2 > 14.3. Thus, the increase of the repair time variation reduces the mission success probability. The mixed effect of increased and decreased repair time on the maximal possible number of repairs and their probabilities can make the functions R(σ) and C(σ) non-monotonic.Fig. 7presents R and C as functions of the maximum allowed mission time τ. Both mission success probability and the conditional expected cost increase with τ as more time is allowed for repairs. For L = 5 the mission cannot succeed when τ<W/g5 = 45.45 because in this case the system cannot fulfill the entire mission even without failures.Consider an example in which the system load can vary continuously from 0.5 to 2. The system time-to-failure obeys the exponential distribution with load dependent failure rate λ = 0.333L1.3. The operation cost and performance also depend on the load according to the following functions: co = 0.8 + 1.2L1.4, g = 25L. The random repair time follows a truncated normal distribution with parameters dmin = 4, dmax = 10, μ = 6 and σ = 2. The per-time unit repair cost is cr= 2. The mission success probability and conditional expected cost as functions of system load for z = 0.1 and z = 0.5 are presented in Fig. 8. It can be seen that both success probability and conditional expected cost are non-monotonic functions of L. For z = 0.1 R(L) reaches its maximum R = 0.98 at load level L = 0.84 when C = 49.2. The minimal conditional expected mission cost C = 47.8 is achieved at load level L = 1.2 when R = 0.977.For z = 0.5 R(L) reaches its maximum R = 0.918 at load level L = 0.68 when C = 50.5. Indeed, when the repair becomes less effective (z increases) the maximum mission success probability is achieved for lower loads, corresponding to lower expected number of repairs. The minimal conditional expected mission cost C = 46.7 is achieved at load level L = 1.32 when R = 0.892. The minimal conditional expected mission cost given R≥0.9 is achieved when L = 1.1. This cost is C = 46.93.This paper models and analyzes the mission success probability and expected cost of single-component repairable systems supporting different load levels and subject to random repair times. As shown through the examples, the proposed numerical algorithm has no limitation on the type of component failure and repair time distributions. Based on the proposed evaluation algorithm, the optimal loading problem is then solved, which finds the component load level to minimize the expected mission cost while meeting a certain system success probability constraint. Relationships between the mission performance (success probability, cost) and parameters (repair efficiency, repair time distribution parameters, maximum allowed mission time) are studied. Empirical studies show that both the mission success probability and expected mission cost decrease with the decrease in the repair efficiency or maximum allowed mission time; the mission success probability always decreases with the increase in mean repair time whereas the effect of mean repair time on expected mission cost as well as the effect of repair time variation on both mission success probability and cost can be non-monotonic.One direction of our future work is to extend the proposed methodology for single-component repairable systems performing multiple-phased mission tasks, where component failure behavior, productivity and operation cost depend not only on the applied load level but also on the mission phase. We will also investigate the optimal component loading problem for multi-component repairable systems designed with different standby sparing techniques.An additional research direction is evaluation and analysis of such mission metrics as system availability during the mission, expected amount of uncompleted work in the case of mission failure, total expected cost of the mission (including the failure cases), expected mission completion time, expected number of repairs.
