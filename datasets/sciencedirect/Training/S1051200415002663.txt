According to random finite set (RFS) and information inequality, this paper derives an error bound for joint detection and estimation (JDE) of multiple unresolved target-groups in the presence of clutters and missed detections. The JDE here refers to determining the number of unresolved target-groups and estimating their states. In order to obtain the results of this paper, the states of the unresolved target-groups are modeled as a multi-Bernoulli RFS first. The point cluster model proposed by Mahler is used to describe the observation likelihood of each group. Then, the error metric between the true and estimated state sets of the groups is defined by the optimal sub-pattern assignment distance rather than the usual Euclidean distance. The maximum a posteriori detection and unbiased estimation criteria are used in deriving the bound. Finally, we discuss some special cases of the bound when the number of unresolved target-groups is known a priori or is at most one. Example 1 shows the variation of the bound with respect to the probability of detection and clutter density. Example 2 verifies the effectiveness of the bound by indicating the performance limitations of the cardinalized probability hypothesis density and cardinality balanced multi-target multi-Bernoulli filters for unresolved target-groups. Example 3 compares the bound of this paper with the (single-sensor) bound of [4] for the case of JDE of a single unresolved target-group. At present, this paper only addresses the static JDE problem of multiple unresolved target-groups. Our future work will study the recursive extension of the bound proposed in this paper to the filtering problems by considering the group state evolutions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
An unresolved target-group [1,2] (also called a ‘point target cluster’ in [3], pp. 432–433) is a cluster of two or more individual targets, which cannot be completely resolved due to finite sensor resolution, type of sensor and target-to-sensor geometry. In other words, by treating a cluster of indistinguishable point targets as an entire object (especially when the individual targets have a coordinated behavior according to high interdependency, it is more reasonable to treat them as an entire object), they are idealized as an unresolved target-group. In general, an unresolved target-group may generate multiple measurements at each scan. As shown in Fig. 1, although the number of detections generated by a group depends on the number of individual targets in the group, they are usually different due to the effect of sensor resolution, missed detection and clutter [4].It should be noted that the unresolved target-group is significantly different from the extended target ([3], pp. 427–430), although both of them may generate multiple measurements at a scan. The extended target arises because the resolution of a sensor is higher than the spatial extent of a target. In such a case, the sensor is able to receive more than one measurement from different corner reflectors (or measurement sources) of the target. The locations of these measurement sources depend on the shape of the target, target-dependent properties (i.e., the nature of the surface) and the target-to-sensor geometry [5]. A comparison between extended target and unresolved target-group is shown in Fig. 2[5].The problem of joint detection and estimation (JDE) arises from a host of applications in defense and surveillance [6], where the number of targets is unknown and the sensor may receive the measurements randomly generated from targets or clutters. There is no information about which are the measurements of interest or which are the clutters. The aim of JDE is to determine the number of the targets and estimate their states using prior information about the targets as well as a sequence of measurements in the presence of clutters, missed detections and association uncertainties. Before about 1997, the study of JDE problem is only restricted to point targets [7–9]. But in recent years, the JDE of multiple unresolved target-groups has attracted extensive attention and many approaches have been proposed [10–23] for it.Obviously, it is very necessary to find an error (lower) bound to assess the achievable performance of the JDE algorithms for unresolved target-groups. The existing performance evaluation methods based on the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) [24–26] are not applicable for such a JDE algorithm since CRLB only considers the estimation error but not the detection error. Within the random finite set (RFS) framework, Rezaeian and Vo [27] derived the JDE error bound for a point target in the presence of clutters and missed detections. We extended the bound to the case of an unresolved target-group in [4]. However, compared with the case of a single object, it is significantly different and much more difficult in determining the object number and defining the error metric for the case of multiple objects. As a result, there have been no conclusions on JDE error bound for multiple unresolved target-groups till now.By the use of the RFS and information inequality ([28], pp. 169–171, 186), this paper proposes an error bound for JDE of multiple unresolved target-groups when clutters and missed detections simultaneously exist. In order to obtain the results of this paper, we first model the states of multiple unresolved target-groups as a multi-Bernoulli RFS [29]. The point cluster model based on the concept of continuous individual target number is used to describe the observation likelihood function of the unresolved target-group as in ([3], pp. 437–440). Since the JDE error is the average distance between the true and estimated sets of group states, the usual Euclidean distance for random vectors cannot be applied here. To overcome this, the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) distance proposed in [30] for random sets is used to measure the JDE error. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection and unbiased estimation criteria are used in deriving the bound. Then the proposed bound is discussed in two special cases where the number of the unresolved target-groups is known a priori or is at most one. Especially in the second case, we show that under certain conditions, the bound of this paper coincides with the (single-sensor) bound in [4], which is proposed for JDE of a single unresolved target-group. Finally, three numerical examples are presented using simulated data. Example 1 shows the variation of the bound with respect to probability of detection and clutter density. Example 2 verifies the effectiveness of the bound by indicating the performance limitations of the unresolved target-group cardinalized probability hypothesis density (U-CPHD) [20] and unresolved target-group cardinality balanced multi-target multi-Bernoulli (U-CBMeMBer) [21] filters. Example 3 compares the bound of this paper with the (single-sensor) bound of [4] for the case of JDE of a single unresolved target-group.In the current set up of this paper, our attention is restricted to the static JDE problem of multiple unresolved target-groups. Our future work will study the recursive extension of the bound proposed in this paper to the filtering problems by considering the group state evolutions.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background and related work for deriving our results. Section 3 describes the JDE problem of multiple unresolved target-groups based on RFS. In Section 4, we present a JDE error bound for unresolved target-groups and discuss two special cases of the bound when the number of the groups is known or is at most one. We present three numerical examples in Section 5. Conclusions and future work are given in Section 6. Relevant mathematical proofs of these conclusions are attached in Appendices A and B.In order to derive the results of this paper, some necessary mathematical foundations are first presented in this section.For any real-valued functionη(Y)of a finite-set variable Y, its set integral is ([31], pp. 141–144)(1)∫η(Y)δY=∑n=0∞1n!∫Ynη(Yn)dy1⋯dyn=η(∅)+∑n=1∞1n!∫Ynη(Yn)dy1⋯dyn,where∫⋅δYdenotes the operator of a set integral,Yn={yi}i=1n⊆Yndenotes the n-points set (that is, the cardinality of the setYnis n),Yndenotes the space ofYn. In this paper, we noteY0=∅. The expectation ofη(Y)over densityf(Y)is(2)E[η]=∫η(Y)f(Y)δY.A multi-Bernoulli RFS Y is defined by a union of M independent Bernoulli RFSsY(i),Y=⋃i=1MY(i). The density of the multi-Bernoulli RFS Y is given by [29],(3)π(Y)=π(∅)∑1≤j1≠⋯≠j|Y|≤M∏i=1|Y|rji1−rjifji(yi),where|Y|denotes the cardinality of a set Y,ri∈[0,1]denotes the probability ofY(i)≠∅,fi(yi)denotes the density ofyi,(4)π(∅)=∏i=1M(1−ri).Thus, a multi-Bernoulli RFS Y is completely described by the multi-Bernoulli parameter setϒ={(ri,fi)}i=1M.Lete(Yn,Yˆnˆ)denote the error metric between the setYn={y1,…,yn}and its estimateYˆnˆ={yˆ1,…,yˆnˆ}. SinceYnandYˆnˆare random sets, the usual Euclidean distance error for random vectors cannot be applied here. To overcome this, the OSPA distance of orderp=2with cut-offc>0[30,32] is used to definee(Yn,Yˆnˆ),(5)e2(Yn,Yˆnˆ)={0,nˆ=n=0,minτ∈Πmax⁡(nˆ,n)⁡∑t=1min⁡(nˆ,n)min⁡(c2,‖yt−yˆτ(t)‖22)+c2|nˆ−n|max⁡(nˆ,n),e2(Yn,Yˆnˆ)={nˆ+n>0,whereΠndenotes the set of permutations of{1,2,…,n},max⁡(⋅)ormin⁡(⋅)denotes the maximization or minimization operation,‖⋅‖2denotes 2-norm.The OSPA metric is comprised of two components each separately accounting for ‘localization’ and ‘cardinality’ errors between two sets. The localization error arises from the estimates paired with the nearest truths, while the cardinality error arises from the unpaired estimates. Schuhmacher et al. [30] have proved that the OSPA distance withp∈[1,∞)andc>0is indeed a metric, so it can be used as a principled performance measure.Given a joint probability densityf(x,z)onX×Z, under regularity conditions and the existence of∂2log⁡f(x,z)/∂xi∂xj, the following inequality holds ([28], pp. 169–171, 186),(6)∫Z∫Xf(x,z)(xl−xˆl(z))2dxdz≥[J−1]l,l,wherexˆ(z)=[xˆ1(z),…,xˆL(z)]Tdenotes an unbiased estimate of the L dimensional vectorx=[x1,…,xL]Tusingz;xlandxˆl(z)are, respectively, the lth components ofxandxˆ(z),l=1,…,L;Jis theL×LFisher information matrix(7)[J]i,j=−Ef[∂2log⁡f(x,z)∂xi∂xj]=−∫Z∫Xf(x,z)∂2log⁡f(x,z)∂xi∂xjdxdz,i,j=1,2,…,L.where[J]i,jdenotes the element on the ith row and jth column of matrix J.Ifxis estimated byxˆ(z)=E[x|z], then (6) is satisfied with equality [24].The state of a single unresolved target-group is modeled by an augmented vector of form(8)x′=[a,x]T∈X′,where the L-dimensional vectorx=[x1,…,xL]T∈X⊂RLdenotes a conventional single-target state in the spaceX;adenotes the expected number of individual targets involved in the group (according to the concept of continuous individual target number proposed by Mahler ([3], pp. 437–440),a∈A⊂R+is a positive real number); theL+1-dimensional vectorx′models a cluster of a individual targets collocated at the single statex;X′denotes the state space of a single unresolved target-group,X′=A×X⊂R+×RL.LetX′(t)denote the state set of the tth unresolved target-group. The tth group either exists with probabilityrt∈[0,1]with its statex′satisfying the densityft(xt′), or does not exist with probability1−rt. Thus, it is suitable to modelX′(t)as a Bernoulli RFS with the density(9)π(X′(t))={1−rt,X′(t)=∅,rtft(xt′),X′(t)={xt′},wherertdenotes the probability ofX′(t)≠∅,ft(xt′)(defined onX′) denotes the density ofxt′.LetX′denote the state set of multiple unresolved target-groups. Naturally,X′can be described by a union of N independent state setX′(t)of a single unresolved target-group,(10)X′=⋃t=1NX′(t),where N denotes the maximum number of unresolved target-groups over a surveillance region.SinceX′(t)(t=1,…,N)constituting the union in (10) has been modeled as a Bernoulli RFS, it is reasonable to modelX′as a multi-Bernoulli RFS according to the definition in Section 2.2. Then, the density ofX′can be described by the parameter setϒ={(rt,ft)}t=1Nas(11)f(X′)=π(∅)∑1≤j1≠⋯≠j|X′|≤N∏t=1|X′|rjt1−rjtfjt(xt′),where|X′|denotes the cardinality of the setX′, and(12)π(∅)=∏t=1N(1−rt).In fact, the multi-Bernoulli state model has been extensively applied in the traditional multiple (point) targets tracking problem ([3], pp. 655–658, 29).Letz∈Zdenote a single measurement received by a sensor and Z the set of sensor measurements, whereZis the measurement space. The measurement originates either from unresolved target-group or from random clutter. For a given state setX′of unresolved target-groups,xt′∈X′(t=1,…,|X′|)is either detected with probabilitypD(xt′)and generates a measurement setΨt(xt′)≠∅with likelihoodg(Ψt(xt′)|xt′), or missed (Ψt(xt′)=∅) with probability1−pD(xt′). Hence, givenX′, Z is formed by the union(13)Z=Ψ1(x1′)∪⋯∪Ψ|X′|(x|X′|′)∪K,where K denotes the clutter RFS with densityfc(K),Ψ1(x1′),…,Ψ|X′|(x|X′|′),Kare assumed to be statistically independent.Letϑm(b,q)denote a generalized binomial distribution on integersm≥0.ϑm(b,q)is defined by its probability generating functionGb,q(l),(14)ϑm(b,q)=1m!⋅dmGb,qdlm(0),(15)Gb,q(l)=∏i=0∞(1−ς(b−i)q+ς(b−i)ql),whereς(b)is a sigmoidal function ([3], p. 437–440). By the use ofϑm(b,q), the likelihood functiong(Ψt(xt′)|xt′)of the tth unresolved target-group with statext′is defined by the point cluster model ([3], pp. 437–440) as(16)g(Ψt(xt′)|xt′)=|Ψt(xt′)|!⋅ϑ|Ψt(xt′)|(at,pD(xt′))∏z∈Ψt(xt′)ϕ(z|xt),t=1,…,|X′|,wherepD(xt′)denotes the probability that an observation will at least be collected by the sensor from the tth unresolved target-group with statext′(i.e., the probability ofΨt(xt′)≠∅),ϕ(z|xt)denotes the single-measurement single-target likelihood function.It should be noted that under the likelihood function (16), an unresolved target-group can generate multiple measurements, the number of which provides some information about how many individual targets are involved in the group (in fact, the information is implied in the generalized binomial distributionϑ|Ψt(xt′)|(at,pD(xt′))in (16)). Otherwise, it is impossible to estimate the number of the individuals in a group and obtain the relevant JDE error bound for the individual number.Within the RFS framework, JDE of multiple unresolved target-groups is to derive their estimated state setXˆ′(Z)={xˆ′1(Z),…,xˆ′|Xˆ′(Z)|(Z)}using the measurement set Z. This paper aims to derive a performance limit to joint detectors-estimators of unresolved target-groups, which is measured by the bound of the averaged error betweenX′andXˆ′(Z).Within the RFS framework, the mean squared error for JDE of multiple unresolved target-groups is defined by(17)σ2=E[e2(X′,Xˆ′(Z))]=∫∫f(X′,Z)e2(X′,Xˆ′(Z))δX′δZ=∫∫γ(Z|X′)f(X′)e2(X′,Xˆ′(Z))δX′δZ,wheree(X′,Xˆ′(Z))denotes the error metric betweenX′andXˆ′(Z), which is defined by the OSPA distance in (5),f(X′,Z)denotes the joint density of two RFSsX′and Z,γ(Z|X′)=f(Z|X′)denotes the total observation likelihood function.According to the fundamental convolution formula (11.252) in ([3], pp. 385), the likelihood functionγ(Z|X′)for the total measurement process modeled in (13) can be derived as(18)γ(Z|X′)=∑W0⊕W1⊕⋯⊕W|X′|=Zfc(W0)⋅ψ(W1|x1′)⋯ψ(W|X′||x|X′|′),where(19)ψ(Wt|xt′)={1−pD(xt′),Wt=∅,pD(xt′)g(Wt|xt′),Wt≠∅,t=1,…,|X′|,andWi⊆Z,i=0,1,…,|X′|, the operation ‘W0⊕W1⊕⋯⊕W|X′|=Z’ denotesW0∪W1∪⋯∪W|X′|=Z, andWi∩Wj=∅ifi≠j,i,j=0,1,…,|X′|. The summation in (18) is taken over all mutually disjoint subsetsW0,W1,…,W|X′|of Z such thatW0∪W1∪⋯∪W|X′|=Z.The derivation of the proposed JDE error bound in this paper is based on the following two criteria:1) MAP detection criterion: It is assumed that the MAP detection criterion is applied to estimate the number of unresolved target-groups. Given a measurement set Z, the cardinalitynˆof the estimated state setXˆ′(Z)is obtained as the maximum of the posterior probabilitiesP(|X′|=n|Z),n=0,1,…,N,(20)nˆ=arg⁡maxn⁡P(|X′|=n|Z).Explanation: In order to find a bound onσ2of (17), we need to find the best choice of the integral regionZ0,m,Z1,m,…,ZN,min (73) which minimizes (73). Nevertheless, it is very difficult to defineZ0,m,Z1,m,…,ZN,mfor the detector without using the MAP criterion because the minimum of (73) depends on the estimatorXˆ′(⋅). This reflects the extreme complexity to defineZ0,m,Z1,m,…,ZN,mfor the detector that minimizes (17) and its intricate interconnection with the estimator that may jointly achieve a lowerσ2of (17) than with the MAP detector. As a result, without the MAP detector restriction, it is nearly impossible to characterize the joint detector-estimator that minimizes (17) due to their extremely complex interrelation in determining the number of groups and estimating the states of existing groups.2) Unbiased estimation criterion: Assuming the state of an unresolved target-group isx˙′, then the estimatorxˆ′(⋅)is unbiased if(21)E⋅|x˙′,|Z|=m[xˆ′]=∫Zmxˆ′(Zm)f(Zm|x˙′)dz1⋯dzm=x˙′holds for anyx˙′and anym>0such thatP(|Z|=m|x˙′)>0, wheref(⋅|x˙′)is the density of observing atZmwhich is not mapped toxˆ′=∅givenx˙′. Eq. (21) means that the expected estimation over all possible m-points measurementZmwhich are not mapped toxˆ′=∅isx˙′. It is assumed that the estimate of the state of an unresolved target-group is unbiased in this paper.Explanation: In the proof of Theorem 1, we have to apply the information inequality of (6) to derive (86), where the unbiased estimation criterion is a necessary condition for the information inequality of (6) to hold ([28], pp. 169–171, 186). In other words, without the unbiased estimation criterion, the information inequality of (6) does not hold and thus (86) cannot be derived. This would make it impossible to obtain the proposed bound in this paper.Theorem 1The error for joint MAP detection and unbiased estimation of multiple unresolved target-groups with multi-Bernoulli state model in(10)and observation model in(13)is bounded by(22)σ2≥∑m=0∞∑n=0N∑nˆ=0,n+nˆ>0NΩn,mm!⋅n!⋅max⁡(n,nˆ)⋅(∑t=1min⁡(n,nˆ)min⁡(c2ωnˆ,n,m,∑l=1L+1[Jt,nˆ,n,m−1]l,l)+c2ωnˆ,n,m|n−nˆ|),where1) c is the cut-off of OSPA distance in(5),L+1is the dimension of unresolved target-group statex′, N is the maximum number of the groups over a surveillance region;2)Ωn,mis the normalization factor of the joint probability densityf(Xn′,Zm);(23)Ωn,m=∫Zm∫Xn′f(Xn′,Zm)dx1′⋯dxn′dz1⋯dzm,3)ωnˆ,n,mis the integration off(Xn′,Zm)over the regionXn′×Znˆ,m;(24)ωnˆ,n,m=∫Znˆ,m∫Xn′f(Xn′,Zm)dx1′⋯dxn′dz1⋯dzm,4)Jt,nˆ,n,mis the Fisher information matrix of the tth unresolved target-group under the assumption that the number of measurements, true and estimated groups are m, n andnˆ, respectively.Jt,nˆ,n,m,ωnˆ,n,mandΩn,min (22) are given by (assumingJt,nˆ,n,m=∞forX′=∅orX′ˆ=∅orZnˆ,m=∅,nˆ=0,1,…,N)(25)[Jt,nˆ,n,m]i,j=−1ωnˆ,n,m2∫Znˆ,m∫X′f(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)⋅∂2log⁡f(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)∂xi,t′∂xj,t′dxt′dz1⋯dzm,(26)ωnˆ,n,m=π(∅)Ωn,m∫Znˆ,m∑1≤j1≠⋯≠jn≤N∑W0⊕W1⊕⋯⊕Wn=Zmπ(∅)Ωn,m⋅Dj1,…,jn(W0,W1,…,Wn)dz1⋯dzm,(27)Ωn,m=π(∅)∑1≤j1≠⋯≠jn≤N∑W0⊕W1⊕⋯⊕Wn=Zm∫ZmΩn,m=π(∅)⋅Dj1,…,jn(W0,W1,…,Wn)dz1⋯dzm,where(28)Dj1,…,jn(W0,W1,…,Wn)=fc(W0)∏t=1nrjt1−rjtHjt(Wt),(29)Hjt(Wt)=∫X′fjt(xt′)ψ(Wt|xt′)dxt′,and1)ψ(Wt|xt′)is given by (19),π(∅)is given by (12),fc(⋅)is the density of clutter RFS,xi,t′andxj,t′are, respectively, the ith and jth components of theL+1dimensional state vectorxt′=[x1,t′,…,xL+1,t′]T,i,j=1,2,…,L+1;2)f(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)is the joint probability density of(xt′,Zm)conditioned on|X′|=n;3) The integral regionZnˆ,minJt,nˆ,n,mandωnˆ,n,mis the subspace ofZm, where the MAP detector assigns|Xˆ′(Zm)|=nˆ(nˆ=0,1,…,N)if m-points measurementZmhappens.Z0,m,Z1,m,...,ZN,mare mutually disjoint and coverZm.Znˆ,mandf(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)in (25) and (26) are given by(30)Znˆ,m={Zm∈Zm:arg⁡maxn⁡{βn(Zm)}=nˆ},(31)βn(Zm)=(∑1≤j1≠⋯≠jn≤N∏t=1nrjt1−rjt)⋅∑1≤j1≠⋯≠jn≤N∑W0⊕W1⊕⋯⊕Wn=ZmDj1,…,jn(W0,W1,…,Wn),(32)f(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)=π(∅)Ωn,m∑1≤j1≠⋯≠jn≤N∑W0⊕W1⊕⋯⊕Wn=Zm=π(∅)Ωn,m⋅Dj1,…,jn(W0,W1,…,Wn)Hjt(Wt)fjt(xt′)ψ(Wt|xt′),Eq.

For example, the calculations of[Jt,nˆ,n,m]i,j,ωnˆ,n,m,Ωn,mandHjt(Wt)would require multiple numerical integrations over the measurement and state spaces if the integrals involved in them have no closed forms; the summations included inf(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n),Ωn,m,ωnˆ,n,mandβn(Zm)are taken over all possiblen+1partitionsW0,W1,…,Wnof measurement setZm. These might make the calculation of the proposed bound numerically intractable.To tackle this, some approximation strategies have to be applied to reduce the computational cost of numerical integrations and summations over measurement partitions. The former can be achieved by using some highly efficient numerical integration methods, such as the Monte Carlo (MC) or quasi-MC integration techniques in method of moments solution of integral equation in [33,34]. The latter can be achieved by using some suboptimal partitioning methods, such as the distance or adaptive-resonance-theory (ART) partitioning methods in [35,36]. Both partitioning methods can effectively limit the number of considered measurement partitions in the summation operation. Even though the explicit number of partitions to achieve good accuracy in both methods depends on the specific measurements, the computational complexities of the summations over the considered measurement partitions in the worst case are approximatelyO(m4)(for the distance partitioning method) [35] andO(m2)(for the ART partitioning method) [36], respectively. Here m is the number of measurements. The subsequent simulations show that the calculation of the proposed bound becomes tractable if these approximation strategies are used, although it might still be somewhat computationally demanding.2) The clutter set K is not restricted to a Poisson RFS, although it is assumed to be a Poisson RFS in the subsequent simulations. In fact, as long as the clutter densityfc(K)is given, the proposed bound can be obtained by substituting it into (22).3) The proposed bound is currently obtained based on the point cluster observation model in ([3], pp. 437–440). So, it can only be applied in situations where the model makes sense. Nevertheless, the point cluster model is in fact just an approximate observation model for the unresolved target-group which is usually comprised of the closely spaced individual targets. Depending on the type of sensor, the fact that a group of targets are unresolvable does not necessarily imply that they are closely spaced. Therefore, the point cluster model is not always true for general unresolved target-group. Actually, as long as the observation likelihoodg(Ψt(xt′)|xt′)for some kind of object (for example, point target, unresolved target-group, extended target and so on) is given, the relevant JDE error bound can be obtained by substituting it into (22).4) Although the multi-Bernoulli state model in (10) is used to model the state setX′of multiple unresolved target-groups here, the results of this paper can actually be extended to the state setX′with other distributions from the proof of Theorem 1, as long as the relevant densityf(X′)is given.Next we discuss the bound of Theorem 1 in the special case in which the number of unresolved target-groups is known a priori. If the number of unresolved target-groups is known to be n (only estimation but not detection is left in this case), then(33)nˆ=n,Znˆ,m=Zm,ωnˆ,n,m=1.The cut-off c of OSPA distance no longer needs to be considered since there is no cardinality error in this case. As a result, Theorem 1 reduces to Corollary 1.Corollary 1The error for unbiased estimation of n unresolved target-groups with multi-Bernoulli state model in(10)and observation model in(13)is bounded by(34)σn2≥∑m=0∞Ωn,mm!⋅n!⋅n∑t=1n∑l=1L+1[Jt,n,m−1]l,l,whereJt,n,mis Fisher information matrix corresponding to the densityf(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n),(35)[Jt,n,m]i,j=−∫Zm∫X′f(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)⋅∂2log⁡f(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)∂xi,t′∂xj,t′dxt′dz1⋯dzm,as well asΩn,mandf(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)are given by(27)and(32).Then, we discuss the relationship between the bound in Theorem 1 and the bound for JDE of a single unresolved target-group using a single sensor proposed in [4]. First, we consider the following assumptions:Assumption 1The number of unresolved target-groups is at most one over a surveillance region. Thus, the group state setX′reduces to a Bernoulli RFS with probability densityThe observation likelihood function of the single unresolved target-group is the same as in (16). Nevertheless, the clutter set K is a Poisson RFS with density(37)fc(K)=e−λ∏z∈Kυ(z)=e−λ∏z∈Kλφ(z),whereυ(z)=λφ(z)denotes the clutter intensity, λ is the average clutter number,φ(z)is the density of clutter spatial distribution.Assumption 3The error metric e defined by (10) of [4] is the OSPA metric. Specifically, the false alarm errore0=e(X′=∅,Xˆ′={xˆ′})and missed detection errore1=e(X′={x′},Xˆ′=∅)in (10) of [4] obey(38)e1=e0=c≥‖x′−xˆ′‖2,∀x′,xˆ′∈X′,where c is the cut-off of OSPA distance. Note that c no longer needs to be considered in the case of|X′|=|Xˆ′|=1since there is no cardinality error in this case.Corollary 2Suppose thatAssumptions 1–3hold, the bound inTheorem 1will reduce to the bound for JDE of a single unresolved target-group using a single sensor in[4]:(39)σ¯2≥(1−r)c2eλ0−λ+r∑m=0∞Ω¯mm!(∑l=1L+1[J¯m−1]l,l+c2(1−ω¯m)),where(40)λ0=∫Z¯0,1υ(z)dz,(41)[J¯m]i,j=−1ω¯m2∫Z¯0,m∫X′f¯(x′,Zm)∂2log⁡f¯(x′,Zm)∂xi′∂xj′dx′dz1⋯dzm,(42)ω¯m=∫Z¯0,m∫X′f¯(x′,Zm)dx′dz1⋯dzm,(43)f¯(x′,Zm)=1Ω¯me−λυZmf(x′)(1−pD(x′)+pD(x′)∑W⊆Zm,W≠∅g(W|x′)υ−W),(44)Ω¯m=e−λλm∫X′f(x′)(1−pD(x′)+pD(x′)∑k=1mm!ϑk(a,pD(x′))(m−k)!λk)dx′,(45)Z¯0,m={Zm∈Zm:∫X′f(x′)(1−pD(x′)+pD(x′)⋅∑W⊆Z,W≠∅g(W|x′)υ−W)dx′≥1−rr},The proof of Corollary 2 can be found in Appendix B.In this example, multiple unresolved target-groups are observed by a sensor over a two-dimensional surveillance regionS=[−S/2,S/2]×[−S/2,S/2]. The state of a single unresolved target-group is denoted asx′=[a,x]T, where a is the expected number of individual targets involved in the group andx=[x,y]Tis the position vector in two dimensional Cartesian plane. The state setX′of the groups is modeled as a multi-Bernoulli RFS in (10) with the parameter set{(rt,ft(xt′))}t=1N, where(46)ft(xt′)=f(at)f(xt)=U(at;εt)N(xt;x0,t,Qt),t=1,…,N,andU(⋅;εt)denotes the density of uniform distribution over the regionεt=[τ1,t,τ2,t](τ2,t>τ1,t>0), i.e.,U(⋅;εt)=1/(τ2,t−τ1,t),N(⋅;x0,t,Qt)denotes the density of Gaussian distribution with meanx0,tand covariance matrixQt.The single-measurement single-target densityϕ(z|xt), included in the unresolved target-group likelihoodg(Ψt(xt′)|xt′)of (16), is(47)ϕ(z|xt)=N(z;h(xt),R),whereh(xt)is the observation function of statext, R is the covariance matrix of measurement noise.The detection probabilitypD(xt′)of the sensor is assumed to be independent of the statext′, i.e.,pD(xt′)=pD,t=1,…,N.The clutter set K is assumed to be a Poisson RFS with the density given by (37). In this example, we assume thatφ(z)=U(z;S), whereU(⋅;S)denotes the density of uniform distribution over the surveillance regionS, i.e.,U(⋅;S)=1/S2.Then, according to Theorem 1, we have(48)f(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)=π(∅)Ωn,m⋅∑1≤j1≠⋯≠jn≤N∑W0⊕W1⊕⋯⊕Wn=ZmDj1,…,jn(W0,W1,…,Wn)Hjt(Wt)(τ2,t−τ1,t)⋅N(xt;x0,t,Qt)ψ(Wt|xt′),(49)ψ(Wt|xt′)={1−pD,Wt=∅,pD|Wt|!ϑ|Wt|(at,pD)∏z∈WtN(z;h(xt),R),Wt≠∅,t=1,…,|X′|,(50)Ωn,m=π(∅)e−λ∑1≤j1≠⋯≠jn≤N∑W0⊕W1⊕⋯⊕Wn=Zmλ|W0|⋅∏t=1n(rjt1−rjt⋅|Wt|!τ2,t−τ1,t∫τ1,tτ2,tϑ|Wt|(at,pD)dat),(51)Dj1,…,jn(W0,W1,…,Wn)=e−λ(λS2)|W0|∏t=1nrjt1−rjtHjt(Wt),(52)Hjt(Wt)={1−pD,Wt=∅,pD|Wt|!τ2,t−τ1,t∫τ1,tτ2,tϑ|Wt|(at,pD)dat⋅∫SN(xt;x0,t,Qt)⋅∏z∈WtN(z;h(xt),R)dxt,Wt≠∅,and the formulas forπ(∅),[Jt,nˆ,n,m]i,j,ωnˆ,n,m,Znˆ,mandβn(Zm)are the same as in (12), (25), (26), (30) and (31).

Substituting the results into (53)–(55) and then (25), we can get∂2log⁡f(xt′,Zm‖X′|=n)/∂xi,t′∂xj,t′and[Jt,nˆ,n,m]i,j. The details are not presented here due to space limitation.Finally, the proposed error bound for JDE of multiple unresolved target-groups is obtained by substituting (48)–(55) into (22). Numerical integration method is needed to compute the values of[Jt,nˆ,n,m]i,jandωnˆ,n,msince the integrals involved in both of them have no closed forms. As explained in the first note after Theorem 1, the MC numerical integration technique in [33] and the ART partitioning method in [36] are used to mitigate the computational burden here.In this example, we assume that the parameter of the surveillance regionSisS=100, the maximum number of unresolved target-groups isN=8, the parameters of the multi-Bernoulli state setX′for the groups are:r1=r2=0.8,r3=r4=0.6,r5=r6=0.4,r7=r8=0.2,ε1=ε2=[2,4],ε3=ε4=[4,6],ε5=ε6=[6,8],ε7=ε8=[8,10],x0,1=[10,10]T,x0,2=[10,−10]T,x0,3=[−10,10]T,x0,4=[−10,−10]T,x0,5=[30,30]T,x0,6=[30,−30]T,x0,7=[−30,30]T,x0,8=[−30,−30]T,(56){Q1=Q2=[49101049],Q3=Q4=[36101036],Q5=Q6=[255525],Q7=Q8=[165516],the observation function and covariance matrix of the measurement noise are(57)h(xt)=[xt2+yt2arctan⁡ytxt],R=[25000.01].For the sake of clarity, we show the JDE error bounds of individual target numbers and position vectors of the unresolved target-groups, respectively. Letσa2andσp2denote the JDE errors of individual target numbers and position vectors of the groups. The corresponding cut-offs of OSPA distance areca2=60andcp2=500.The proposed bounds onσa2andσp2are shown as functions ofpDand λ in Fig. 3.Fig. 3 shows that givenpD, the proposed error bounds onσa2andσp2for JDE of multiple unresolved target-groups are non-linear functions of λ:1) ForpD=1, the bounds increase with λ. A reasonable explanation is that in the case ofpD=1, the possibility for missed groups is very small and thus the false group estimates and state estimate errors generated by the clutters have major contribution to the bounds. As a result, larger λ could result in bigger possibility for the error of false group estimates givenpD=1, which will increase the bounds.2) ForpD=0.6, the bounds increase with λ when λ is less than about 180 or larger than about 240, otherwise, decrease with λ. A reasonable explanation is that the increase of λ could generate two contrary effects whenpD<1, i.e., reducing the possibility for missed groups and increasing the possibility for false group estimates and state estimate errors. The former results in decrease of the bounds while the latter results in increase of the bounds. GivenpD=0.6, within the approximate range ofλ≤180orλ≥240, the bounds are dominated by the latter and thus increase with λ. Otherwise, the bounds are dominated by the former and thus decrease with λ.3) ForpD=0.2, the bounds first decrease with λ when λ is less than about 220, and then increase with λ when λ exceeds about 220. A reasonable explanation is that whenpDis relatively small, the possibility for missed groups is very large. When λ is less than about 220, larger λ could instead result in less possibility for the error of missed groups, which is helpful in decreasing the bounds. On the contrary, when λ is larger than about 220, the error of false group estimates generated by clutters exceeds the error of missed groups. This leads to the increase of the bounds with λ in this case.Moreover, it can be seen from Fig. 3 that for different λ, the bounds do not always decrease withpD. This is because of the two contrary effects generated by the increase ofpDwhenλ>0, i.e., reducing the possibility for missed groups and increasing the possibility for false group estimates. The former results in decrease of the bounds while the latter results in increase of the bounds. When λ is relatively small (i.e., λ is less than about 110 in this example), the bounds are dominated by the former and thus decrease withpD. When λ is relatively big (i.e., λ is more than about 210 in this example), the bounds are dominated by the latter and thus increase withpD.To verify the effectiveness of the proposed bound, we compare it with the JDE errors of the U-CPHD and U-CBMeMBer filters for the scenarios and parameters of Example 1.The U-CPHD and U-CBMeMBer filters have recently been proposed in [20, 21] for JDE of multiple unresolved target-groups from a sequence of observations in the presence of clutters, missed detections and association uncertainties. The joint determination of the number of groups and estimation of their states (that is, the estimated state set of the groups) can be obtained recursively via both filters. The particle implementation (for generic models) and the Gaussian mixture implementation (for linear Gaussian models) of the two filters are similar to [29,35–38]. The main difference between the two filters is that the U-CPHD filter recursively propagates the first-order moment and cardinality distribution of the posterior density of the groups. It operates on the state space of single group and thus, the clustering-based states extraction for multiple groups has to be involved in its particle implementation. The U-CBMeMBer filter recursively propagates the parameters of a multi-Bernoulli density that approximates the posterior density of the groups. The key advantage of the U-CBMeMBer filter is that its particle implementation does not require clustering to extract state estimates, which may be expensive and unreliable [29].The state evolution (or dynamic) model of the unresolved target-groups used in the two filters is usually described as(58)Xk′=[⋃xk−1′∈Xk−1′Θk|k−1(xk−1′)]∪Γk,where the subscriptk−1or k denotes time indices,Γkis the state set of new birth groups at time k,Θk|k−1(xk−1′)is the state set generated by the group with the statexk−1′at time k. The group with the statexk−1′at timek−1either continues to exist at time k with surviving probabilitypS,k(xk−1′)and moves to a new statexk′with probability densityfk|k−1(xk′|xk−1′), or dies with probability1−pS,k(xk−1′). Thus,Θk|k−1(xk−1′)is a Bernoulli RFS with density(59)fk(Θk|k−1(xk−1′))={1−pS,k(xk−1′),Θk|k−1(xk−1′)=∅,pS,k(xk−1′)fk|k−1(xk′|xk−1′),Θk|k−1(xk−1′)={xk′}.Since the current set up of the proposed bound is restricted to the static JDE problem, we first need to convert the two dynamic filtering algorithms to static methods. To achieve this, we change the state evolution model of the unresolved target-groups in (58) and (59) to(60){Θk|k−1(xk−1′)={xk−1′},pS,k(xk−1′)=1,Γk=∅,⇒Xk′=Xk−1′In addition, the observation model for the unresolved target-groups used in the two filters is the same as in (13). After this, the states and measurements of the unresolved target-groups are no longer time realted. As a result, the U-CPHD and U-CBMeMBer filters actually reduce to the static joint detectors-estimators for the unresolved target-groups, specialized to a fixed time instant.Fig. 4shows the comparison results between the proposed bound and the JDE errors of the U-CPHD and U-CBMeMBer filters. It should be noted that the JDE errors of the two filters are derived by the average of 500 MC runs of their OSPA distances betweenX′andXˆ′(Z).It can be seen from Fig. 4 that1) Although the JDE errors of the U-CPHD and U-CBMeMBer filters are a little higher than the proposed bound, all of them are always close versus λ andpD. The extra errors of the two filters are generated by the first-order moment approximation and multi-Bernoulli approximation for the posterior density of the unresolved target-groups, respectively. Fig. 4 also shows that the U-CBMeMBer filter outperforms the U-CPHD filter. An explanation for this is that the latter has to include a clustering process in its particle implementation for states extraction, which leads to more performance loss than the former.2) The bigger λ becomes, or the lowerpDbecomes, the bigger the gap between the errors of the two filters and the proposed bound. This is because the aforementioned approximation errors of the two filters increase as λ becomes bigger orpDbecomes smaller. However, the maximum relative errors of the U-CPHD and U-CBMeMBer filters, which appear in the case ofpD=0.2andλ=300, do not exceed 22% and 12% of the bound in any case, respectively. In fact, the total average relative errors of the two filters are about 11% and 7% of the bound for various λ andpD, respectively.Finally, the comparison results in Fig. 4 show that the proposed bound gives an effective indication of performance limitations for the two unresolved target-group JDE algorithms.Moreover, the computational requirement of the U-CPHD filter, U-CBMeMBer filter and the proposed bound shown in Fig. 4 is compared via the CPU processing time. Their average computational time over 500 MC runs for various λ andpDin a fairly optimal Matlab implementation on 2.5 GHz Intel Core™ 2 Quad Q8300 processor and 4 GB RAM are, respectively, 10.8 s, 6.1 s and 36.9 s. Obviously the proposed bound of this paper consumes much more time than the U-CPHD and U-CBMeMBer filters. However, it has been known that the aim of an error bound is to assess the achievable performance of the suboptimal filters [24]. In other words, different from a filter which gives the estimation of state or state-set, an error bound indicates the performance limitation of the filtering method. Therefore, the error bound in general does not need to be calculated in real time. Compared with a filter, the restriction for the computational requirement of an error bound can be relaxed appropriately.In order to compare the bound in Theorem 1 with the bound in Corollary 2, the number of unresolved target-groups over the surveillance region is restricted to be at most one here. The group state setX′becomes a Bernoulli RFS with the density in (36). In this example, we assume thatr=0.6,f(x′)=f(a)f(x)=U(a;ε)N(x;x0,Q), where(61)ε=[2,8],x0=[5,0]T,Q=[251010100].The other scenarios and parameters are the same as in Example 1.The comparison between the bound in Theorem 1 and the bound in Corollary 2 is shown as function ofpDand λ in Fig. 5.Fig. 5 shows that givenpDand λ, the bound in Theorem 1 is obviously larger than the bound in Corollary 2 for JDE of a single unresolved target-group. Moreover, in the cases ofpD<1, the latter has only one turning-pointλ¯⁎(pD)while the former has two turning-pointsλ1⁎(pD)andλ2⁎(pD)with the increase of λ. This is because the bound in Corollary 2 is obtained by knowing that the number of the unresolved target-groups is at most one but the bound in Theorem 1 is not. In other words, the cardinality error generated by false group estimates is at most one for the bound in Corollary 2 even if λ is very big, but the cardinality error generated by false group estimates may be far larger than one for the bound in Theorem 1 when λ is big. As a result, compared with the bound in Theorem 1, the bound in Corollary 2 has smaller possibility for false group estimates given the same λ. When λ exceedsλ¯⁎(pD), the increase of λ instead reduces the missed detection error for the bound in Corollary 2, which in turn leads to the decrease of the bound. The reasons for the variation of the bound in Theorem 1 are the same as those of Example 1. It should be noted that the plots of the bound in Theorem 1 here are slightly different from those of Example 1 because of the use of different number and existence probabilities for the unresolved target-groups.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Within the RFS framework, we derive a JDE error bound for multiple unresolved target-groups in the presence of clutters and missed detections by the use of information inequality. The proposed bound is based on the OSPA distance rather than the usual Euclidean distance. Then, we discuss the special cases of the bound when the number of unresolved target-groups is known a priori or is at most one. Three examples show the applicability of the proposed bound. Our future work will focus on the following four aspects:1) Studying the recursive extensions of the results to filtering problems by considering the state evolutions of multiple unresolved target-groups.2) Extending the results by introducing the object extension (or shape) as an additional random variable to characterize the state of unresolved target-group.3) Studying the sensor management strategies based on the results.4) Note that the computational complexity will be an important consideration to apply the proposed bounds to sensor management problems. Although some approximation strategies [34–36] have been used to mitigate the computational burden in this paper, it might still be computationally demanding for such an application. Therefore, we will further study faster and more efficient approximation techniques to reduce the computational cost of the proposed bounds.
