@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A spectral angle based feature extraction method, Spectral Clustering Independent Component Analysis (SC-ICA), is proposed in this work to improve the brain tissue classification from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). SC-ICA provides equal priority to global and local features; thereby it tries to resolve the inefficiency of conventional approaches in abnormal tissue extraction. First, input multispectral MRI is divided into different clusters by a spectral distance based clustering. Then, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is applied on the clustered data, in conjunction with Support Vector Machines (SVM) for brain tissue analysis. Normal and abnormal datasets, consisting of real and synthetic T1-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, were used to evaluate the performance of the new method. Comparative analysis with ICA based SVM and other conventional classifiers established the stability and efficiency of SC-ICA based classification, especially in reproduction of small abnormalities. Clinical abnormal case analysis demonstrated it through the highest Tanimoto Index/accuracy values, 0.75/98.8%, observed against ICA based SVM results, 0.17/96.1%, for reproduced lesions. Experimental results recommend the proposed method as a promising approach in clinical and pathological studies of brain diseases.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a multi sequence medical imaging technique with which stacks of images are acquired with different tissue contrasts. Each sequence, namely, T1-weighted, T2-weighted, Proton Density (PD), Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), etc., highlights specific properties of tissues and pathologies, but none of them can provide completely decisive and reliable information. Intensity profile of 1000 continuous samples from T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR images is plotted in Fig. 1. Variations in tissue properties for same sample in different sequences can be observed from the given plots. Simultaneous observation and quantitative analysis of diagnostic information across MRI slices is a tedious job for radiologists. Multispectral MRI analysis [1,2] can simplify the job considerably, by combining unlimited number of co-registered sequences in a single suite. However, information extraction from this complicated structure is a challenging job, where the researchers and radiologists are focusing for last few decades [1–3].Pattern recognition techniques are generally considered as the most effective methods for multi-spectral image analysis, where the classification methods are divided into unsupervised and supervised learning. Clarke et al. [3] presented a good review of relative merits of single versus multispectral image segmentation using supervised and unsupervised approaches. Unsupervised methods like Expectation Maximization (EM), k-means [2,3] and its fuzzy equivalent, the most widely used Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) [4] generally creates satisfactory results in MR image analysis [5,6]. But cluster is not a reliable method for accurate classification in pathological analysis [3]. The conventional supervised learning machines like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) [3,7], Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) [8], Support Vector Machines (SVM) [7,9], and data conditioning approaches [3] have been effectively used in multispectral MRI analysis [10,11]. However, application of these conventional classification methods alone in multispectral MRI analysis often failed to provide expected clinical accuracy [3,5].Recent researches on feature extraction using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [12,13] and its extensions [14,15] have contributed a lot in high performance brain tissue classification and medical diagnosis. ICA and its non-linear extension, kernel ICA [16], spectrally unmix the data into a set of statistically Independent Components (ICs) representing different brain tissues, Gray Matter (GM), White Matter (WM), Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF), etc. [13]. A thorough analysis of ICA based SVM (referred to as ICA+SVM) classification, and its performance in multispectral analysis with limited dimensionality is provided in [15,17]. As a global transform, ICA is good only at extracting the frequently occurred features and it fails to preserve the local characteristics [18]. Researchers have attempted to resolve these issues through extensions like local ICA [18,19], wavelet based ICA [20], spectral screening ICA [21], etc. However, the subset based approaches and approximations in these literatures find its difficulty in MRI analysis, where soft tissues and small abnormalities are to be extracted with high accuracy from a limited number of bands.A new spectral clustering algorithm based on Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) [22], Spectral Clustering Independent Component Analysis (SC-ICA), is proposed in this work to extend ICA for improved feature extraction from multispectral MRI. As a spectral angle based pre-processing technique, it can exploit intrinsic spectral characteristics of input signals and it is robust to input energy differences [22]. The main objective of this method is to retain less frequently occurred objects like small lesions, while dealing with massive amount of information in multispectral analysis. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm was done with SVM classification using synthetic and real, normal and abnormal, brain MRI images. Synthetic image analysis was performed on slices from T1-weighted, T2-weighted and PD sequences, whereas T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences were selected for clinical image analysis. Detailed comparison of the proposed method with ICA based SVM [17], and other existing supervised classification methods like SVM, PNN, ANN and Bagging confirmed the superiority of the new approach in brain tissue and small abnormality analysis.Synthetic MR images included in this work contains normal and abnormal (multiple sclerosis) data obtained from BrainWeb [23], the Simulated Brain Database at the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), McGill University. Axial T1-Weighted Images (T1WI), T2-Weighted Images (T2WI), and PD Images (PDI) formed the input multispectral suite. Slices from each sequence have parameter settings, 1-mm slice thickness and noise level, 0% and 1%.T1WI, T2WI and FLAIR images of 60 cases (40 normal and 20 abnormal), sampled by Siemens’ whole body 3T MR system (Siemens, AG Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany), were selected for clinical analysis with following settings: Axial spin echo T1WI with repetition time (TR)=1600ms, echo time (TE)=8.9ms, image dimension 320×320 pixels, and T2WI with TR/TE=4000ms/95ms, size 416×512 pixels. FLAIR images with image dimension 464×512 pixels, TR/TE/inversion time=6000ms/94ms/2026.5ms for abnormal cases and with TR/TE/inversion time=9000ms/94ms/2500ms for normal cases were also included in the analysis. Additional parameters were, slice gap 6.5mm and slice thickness 5mm.The proposed method is divided into two parts: (i) spectral distance based clustering of multispectral MRI data and (ii) modifying the centering and whitening [24] part of the ICA algorithm with statistical measures from clustered multispectral data. Proposed algorithm is outlined in Fig. 2. The grouped portion explains the details of proposed extensions to simple ICA process. Initially, input multispectral MRI cube is formed by placing registered T1WI, T2WI and PD/FLAIR image in 1st, 2nd and 3rd dimensions, respectively. Let ‘x’ be the L (here L=3) dimensional pixel vector, which is linearly mixed by a set of m statistically independent tissues or tumor information, s1, s2,…, sm, by means of a L×m mixing matrix ‘A’. Proposed SC-ICA algorithm extracts the unknown sources, s1, s2,…, sm, from the image cube, as described below.Pijin Fig. 2 represents (i, j)th pixel vector, also known as the spectral signature at pixel location (i, j). In this work, Pij=[x1x2x3]T, where x1, x2 and x3 are (i, j)th intensity values for T1WI, T2WI and PD/FLAIR images, respectively. First, cluster set, S, is initialized with the first pixel vector. The next step is the similarity checking between spectral signatures by SAM [22], in which spectral angle, φ, is calculated as(1)ϕ=cos−1x⋅y||x||||y||where x and y are the input signature and reference signature, respectively.For each input Pij, we considered the cluster mean as the reference signature to calculate φ. The pixel vectors are classified into appropriate groups by thresholding with some spectral angle threshold value, α. Centering of the data for each cluster is separately done, and covariance matrix CXis calculated. After that, common ICA procedures [24], as shown in Fig. 2, are followed to generate ICs representing different brain tissues. The entire procedure is summarized into two algorithms: spectral clustering algorithm and Spectral Clustering Independent Component Analysis (SC-ICA), as given below.Input: Multispectral MRI cube, X, with pixel vectors Pijand spectral angle threshold, α.Step1: Initialize unique cluster set S with a set containing first pixel vector in the image cube.Step2:loop1– for each Pijdo,beginloop2– for each unique cluster ckfrom SbeginCalculate reference spectral signature,cμk=average pixel vector for ckFind φij=Angle between Pijand cμk.if φij<α, add Pijto ck.

SVM classification using RBF kernel [7] is applied on selected features to analyze the reproduced tissues, both visually and quantitatively.
