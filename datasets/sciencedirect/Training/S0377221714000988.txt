@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we consider nonlinear integer optimization problems. Nonlinear integer programming has mainly been studied for special classes, such as convex and concave objective functions and polyhedral constraints. In this paper we follow an other approach which is not based on convexity or concavity. Studying geometric properties of the level sets and the feasible region, we identify cases in which an integer minimizer of a nonlinear program can be found by rounding (up or down) the coordinates of a solution to its continuous relaxation. We call this property rounding property. If it is satisfied, it enables us (for fixed dimension) to solve an integer programming problem in the same time complexity as its continuous relaxation. We also investigate the strong rounding property which allows rounding a solution to the continuous relaxation to the next integer solution and in turn yields that the integer version can be solved in the same time complexity as its continuous relaxation for arbitrary dimensions.It is well known that adding integrality constraints to continuous optimization problems increases their complexity in the majority of cases. A prominent example is linear programming, which can be solved in polynomial time by interior point methods, but becomes NP hard if integrality constraints are added. Integer linear programming has been widely studied and developed into a mature discipline. The theory developed in integer nonlinear programming is much less mature. According to Hemmecke, Köppe, Lee, and Weismantel (2010, chap. 15) who provide a recent overview, “integer nonlinear programming is still a very young field”.Integer nonlinear programming has been tackled by different communities. In the context of global optimization the main focus is to develop numerical procedures for solving nonlinear integer problems. Also techniques from integer linear programming are transferred to nonlinear integer programs. Results exist for integer concave minimization (equivalently integer convex maximization) which are based on the observation that a (quasi-)concave function attains its minimum (if it exists) at an extreme point of the feasible set. Hence an enumeration of all vertices of the convex hull of the integer points would solve the problem. More efficient structures based on total unimodularity for linear constraints allow polynomial procedures. Results for integer concave minimization can be found for example in De Loera, Hemmecke, Onn, and Weismantel (2008). The methods used for convex integer minimization are different; early approaches include the extension of branch and bound methods for linear integer programming (Gupta & Ravindran, 1985) which has been extended for example to convex quadratic integer programming (Buchheim, Caprara, & Lodi, 2012), or an extension of the cutting plane technique of Kelley (1960). More recently, outer approximation procedures have been suggested (Bonami et al., 2008). Research has also been done for special cases such as integer minimization of polynomial functions over polyhedral sets where an FPTAS is possible (De Loera, Hemmecke, Köppe, & Weismantel, 2006), of separable convex functions over polyhedral sets where proximity results are provided in Hochbaum and Shanthikumar (1990) or of strongly convex functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients over polytopes (Baes, Del Pia, Nesterov, Onn, & Weismantel, 2012). The idea of test sets for linear integer optimization problems (Graver, 1975) was transferred to some special cases of nonlinear integer optimization in Lee, Onn, and Weismantel (2008). Boolean nonlinear optimization has been considered for special types of problems, many of them motivated by discrete or network optimization as for example the quadratic assignment problem. An example for a recent approach can be found in Buchheim and Rinaldi (2007).The approach we suggest in this paper is based on the level sets of the objective function: given a functionf:Rn→Rthe (sub-)level set with respect to some levelz∈Ris defined asL⩽(z)≔{x∈Rn:f(x)⩽z}. Using level sets, the optimization problemmin{f(x):x∈F}for some functionf:Rn→Rand some setF⊆Rncan be reformulated asmin{z:L⩽(z)∩F≠∅,z∈R}, (wheremin{∅}≔∞), i.e., the goal is to identify the smallest level for which a feasible point exists. This approach is known as graphical approach in linear programming.In this paper we treat the integrality constraint for an optimization problemmin{f(x):x∈F,x∈Zn}in the same way, i.e., we identify the smallest valuez∈Rfor whichL⩽(z)∩F∩Zn≠∅. This approach provides structural insight into the properties of an optimal solution. In particular we investigate the rounding property, i.e., in which cases one can solve the integer version of a nonlinear optimization problem by rounding (up or down) the coordinates of a solution to its continuous relaxation. If the rounding property holds for a problem, a finite dominating set is given by the set of all integer points adjacent to an optimal solution of its continuous relaxation. Therefore our results can be seen as proximity results (similar to Hochbaum & Shanthikumar (1990)) as we identify cases where‖x∗-x¯‖∞⩽1for an integer solutionx∗and a solution to the relaxationx¯. It is known that convexity does not imply such a rounding property. However, we identify two different problem classes that satisfy the rounding property. These problems need not be convex and their objective functions not even continuous. Our analysis is done by investigating the geometric structure of the level sets.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section we introduce the rounding property. In Sections 3 and 4 we present two different geometric criteria which ensure the rounding property. Both lead to classes of nonlinear integer optimization problems which can be solved efficiently. The paper is ended by some conclusions and further research questions.We consider integer nonlinear optimization problems given by some objective functionf:Rn→Rand some feasible setF⊆Rn(IP)min{f(x):x∈F,x∈Zn}.The continuous relaxation of(IP)is given by(CP)min{f(x):x∈F}.Throughout the paper we assume that(IP)has an optimal solutionx∗and that an optimal solutionx¯to the continuous relaxation(CP)is known.We investigate in which cases rounding the continuous minimizerx¯yield an optimal solution to(IP). By rounding we mean to round each coordinate ofx¯up or down to the respective next integer, i.e., forx=(x1,…,xn)t∈Rnwe defineRound(x)≔y∈Zn:yi∈{⌊xi⌋,⌈xi⌉}∀ias the set of integer points with rounded coordinates. Forx∈Znwe haveRound(x)={x}and forx∈RnRound(x)contains at most2npoints. We also investigate when roundingx¯to its closest integer point yields an optimal solution for(IP). We therefore definexto be the closest integer point to x, i.e., the coordinatesxiare rounded to the closest integeryi=xifor alli=1,…,nusing any fixed rule, e.g. the round half up rule in order to break ties.Now we can introduce the following two rounding properties for nonlinear integer optimization problems given by some objective function f and a feasible set F.Definition 2.1We say that(f,F)has the rounding property if for any optimal solutionx¯to(CP)there exists an optimal solutionx∗to(IP), such thatx∗∈Round(x¯).If the rounding property holds, it guarantees that if(CP)is polynomially solvable then(IP)is also solvable in polynomial time for any fixed dimension, namely by first solving(CP)and then testing the at most2npoints inRound(x¯)∩F. This approach yields an efficient algorithm if the problem(CP)can be solved efficiently and the dimension n is rather small or if there are only a few points inRound(x¯)∩F.Note that the rounding property is trivially satisfied, but not at all helpful for the special case of Boolean optimization problems(BP)min{f(x):x∈F,x∈{0,1}n}forf:[0,1]n→R, since enumerating the at most2nfeasible 0/1 vectors is always an (inefficient) option to solve the problem.In order to tackle also problems of type(BP), and to be more efficient when solving problems of type(IP), we introduce the strong rounding property.Definition 2.2We say that(f,F)has the strong rounding property if for any optimal solutionx¯to(CP)there exists an optimal solutionx∗to(IP), such thatx∗=x¯.The strong rounding property guarantees that if(CP)is polynomially solvable then(IP)is also solvable in polynomial time not only for fixed dimension.Note that a function may have the (strong) rounding property without being continuous. However, continuity might be helpful in order to solve(CP). In the next two sections we derive two different classes of problems (specified by properties of f and F) satisfying the rounding property. To do so, the following reformulation of the (strong) rounding property is helpful.Lemma 2.1(i)(f,F)has the rounding property⇔for any optimal solutionx¯to(CP)and for allx∈Zn∩Fwe have thatL⩽(f(x))∩F∩Round(x¯)≠∅.(f,F)has the strong rounding property⇔for any optimal solutionx¯to(CP)and for allx∈Zn∩Fwe have thatx¯∈L⩽(f(x))∩F.(i)“⇒” Letx¯be an optimal solution to(CP). Since(f,F)has the rounding property there existsx∗∈Round(x¯)optimal to(IP). This means thatx∗∈Fandf(x)⩾f(x∗)for anyx∈Zn∩F, hencex∗∈L⩽(f(x))for allx∈Zn∩Fand thereforeL⩽(f(x))∩F∩Round(x¯)≠∅.“⇐” Letx¯be optimal for(CP). IfL⩽(f(x))∩F∩Round(x¯)≠∅for anyx∈Zn∩Fthere exists ay∈Round(x¯)∩Fsuch thatf(y)⩽f(x)for anyx∈Zn∩F. This means one of the points inRound(x¯)∩Fis optimal for(IP).“⇒” If(f,F)has the strong rounding property,x∗≔x¯is an optimal solution to(IP)and hence contained inL⩽(f(x))for allx∈Zn∩F.“⇐” Letx¯be optimal for(CP). Ifx¯∈L⩽(f(x))for anyx∈Zn∩Fwe obtain thatf(x¯)⩽f(x)for anyx∈Zn∩F, hencex¯is optimal for(IP).□To start with, we recall the definition of a star-shaped set: a setM⊆Rnis called star-shaped if a pointx0∈Mexists, such that for anyy∈Mthe line segmentλx0+(1-λ)y,λ∈[0,1], is contained in M. Boltyanski, Martini, and Soltan (1996) generalized this definition by introducing d-star-shaped sets for any normd:Rn→Ras follows: fora,b∈Rndenote by[a,b]d≔{x∈Rn:d(a,x)+d(x,b)=d(a,b)}the d-segment of a and b with respect to the norm d. Then a setM⊆Rnis called d-star-shaped if a pointx0∈Mexists, such that for anyy∈Mthe d-segment[x0,y]dis contained in M.One can easily see thatl2-star-shapedness is equivalent to star-shapedness as defined above. In the following we denotel1-star-shaped sets as cross-shaped. Furthermore we specify the required pointx0and call the set cross-shaped with respect tox0.Definition 3.1A setM⊆Rnis called cross-shaped w.r.t.x0if for anyy∈Mthel1-segment[x0,y]l1is contained in M.Note that[a,b]l1≔{p∈Rn:pi=λiai+(1-λi)bi,λi∈[0,1]∀i=1,…,n}=∏i=1n[min{ai,bi},max{ai,bi}],i.e.,[a,b]l1is the box given by a and b.Fig. 1shows some examples for cross-shaped sets. Note that cross-shaped sets need not be convex (see Fig. 1-left) and convex sets need not be cross-shaped (see Fig. 1-right). On the other hand cross-shaped sets are always star-shaped but star-shaped sets need not be cross-shaped (see Fig. 1-middle and right).There are some basic set operations that preserve cross-shapedness of sets: a set M that is cross-shaped w.r.t.x∈Mcan be scaled (λMis cross-shaped w.r.t.λx) and translated (M+ais cross-shaped w.r.t.x+a) without loosing its cross-shapedness. If several sets are cross-shaped with respect to the same pointx0also their intersection and union are cross-shaped w.r.t.x0.We are interested in cross-shaped sets because a problem given by(f,F)has the rounding property if the intersections of the level sets of f with F are cross-shaped with respect to any continuous minimizer:Theorem 3.1Let(f,F)be given. Assume that for any optimal solutionx¯to(CP)L⩽(z)∩Fis cross-shaped w.r.t.x¯for allz⩽min{f(x):x∈Round(x¯)∩F}. Then(f,F)has the rounding property.Choose any optimal solutionx¯to(CP). Letx∈Zn∩Fbe an arbitrary point. We want to show that there exists a pointy∈Round(x¯)∩Fwhich is at least as good as x, i.e.,f(y)⩽f(x).Letz̃=min{f(u):u∈Round(x¯)∩F}. Assumez̃>f(x). Then we have thatL⩽(f(x))∩Fis cross-shaped w.r.t.x¯, i.e.,[x¯,x]l1⊆L⩽(f(x))∩F.Defineyi≔x¯iifxi>x¯ix¯iifxi⩽x¯iwhich is inRound(x¯)and satisfiesl1(x¯,y)+l1(y,x)=l1(x¯,x), i.e.,y∈[x¯,x]l1⊆L⩽(f(x))∩F.Hence,y∈Round(x¯)∩Fandf(y)⩽f(x)- which meansz̃⩽f(y)⩽f(x)and is thus a contradiction.□Using the remarks after Definition 3.1 we can state which manipulations of functions whose level sets are cross-shaped conserve this property: iff:Rn→Rhas cross-shaped level sets so hasf(β(x-a))for everyβ∈R⧹{0}anda∈Rn. If several functionsfifulfill that their level sets are cross-shaped w.r.t. the same point so are the level sets of the maximum and the minimum of those functions since their level sets are the intersection or the union, respectively of the level sets of the given functions.Next we give two examples for classes of functions whose level sets are cross-shaped. Recall the definition given in Bauer, Stoer, and Witzgall (1961): a norm‖·‖:Rn→R0+is called monotonic if|xi|⩽|yi|for everyi=1,…,nimplies‖x‖⩽‖y‖.Lemma 3.1Let‖·‖be a monotonic norm anda∈Rn. Thenf(x)≔‖x-a‖,F≔Rnsatisfy the rounding property.The unique continuous minimizer is obviouslyx¯=a. Denote the unit ball of‖·‖byB≔{x∈Rn:‖x‖⩽1}. Lety∈Bandp∈[y,0]l1, i.e., for alli=1,…,nwe have|pi|=|λiyi|=λi|yi|⩽|yi|for someλi∈[0,1]and therefore‖p‖⩽‖y‖⩽1as the norm is monotonic. This means[y,0]l1∈Bfor everyy∈Band so B is cross-shaped with respect to 0 which implies thatL⩽,f(z)=a+zBis cross-shaped w.r.t a for all z.□Fig. 1 shows that convex level sets need not be cross-shaped and convex functions in general do not have the rounding property inRnifn⩾2. However, convexity of the level sets is sufficient to guarantee the rounding property in the casen=1. This turns out to be a special case of our next lemma which says that separability is a sufficient criterion for the cross-shapedness of the level sets of a convex function. Similar to Hemmecke et al. (2010, chap. 15), let us call a functionf:Rn→Rseparable quasiconvex if it can be written asf(x)=∑i=1nfi(xi)with quasiconvex functionsfi:R→Rfor alli=1,…,n.Lemma 3.2Letfi:R→Rbe quasiconvex functions,i=1,…,n. Then the following holds.•The level sets off(x)≔∑i=1nfi(xi), i.e., of a separable quasiconvex function f, are cross-shaped with respect to any optimal solutionx¯to(CP)min{f(x):x∈Rn}.The level sets ofg(x)≔maxi=1nfi(xi)are cross-shaped with respect to any optimal solutionx¯to(CP)min{g(x):x∈Rn}.Letx¯be an optimal solution for(CP). This means thatfi(x¯i)⩽fi(x)∀x∈Rand for alli=1,…,n.Letz⩾f(x¯). IfL⩽(z)={x¯}we are done. Therefore assume that there is another pointy∈L⩽(z). Then every pointp∈[x¯,y]l1can be described asp=(λ1x¯1+(1-λ1)y1,…,λnx¯n+(1-λn)yn)withλi∈[0,1]for alli=1,…,n. This yieldsf(p)=∑i=1nfi(λix¯i+(1-λi)yi)⩽∑i=1nmax{fi(x¯i),fi(yi)}=∑i=1nfi(yi)=f(y)⩽z.So we havep∈L⩽(z)and thus[x¯,y]l1⊆L⩽(z)for everyy∈L⩽(z). Summarizing,L⩽(z)is cross-shaped w.r.t.x¯for allz⩾f(x¯).For the second assertion we analogously obtain thatg(p)⩽maxi=1nfi(yi)=g(y)⩽z, i.e., also in this case the level sets are cross shaped w.r.tx¯for allz⩾g(x¯).□An easy consequence of this lemma is that axisparallel ellipsoid are cross-shaped with respect to its center. This means that ifD=diag(a)is diagonal matrix witha∈R+nthenf(x)≔xtDx+Ltx+coverF=Rnsatisfies the rounding property – this result is also given in Buchheim et al. (2012) and Buchheim, Hübner, and Schöbel (2013).Example 3.1We consider the problem(IP)min{f(x):l⩽x⩽u,x∈Zn}wheref:Rn→Ris a separable convex function andl⩽u,l,u∈Rn.Letx¯be any optimal solution to (CP). Then the level setsL⩽,f(z)and the feasible region F are cross-shaped w.r.t.x¯, and hence so is their intersection. Thus, Theorem 3.1 proves that problem(f,F)has the rounding property.The class of problems considered in Example 3.1 is a special case also considered by Hochbaum and Shanthikumar (1990). They consider the broader class of problems minimizing a separable convex functionf:Rn→Rover a bounded polyhedron{x∈Rn:Ax⩾b}and give the following proximity result: for each optimal solutionx¯to (CP), there exists an optimal solutionx∗for (IP) such that‖x¯-x∗‖∞⩽n·Δ, whereΔis the maximum of the absolute values of the determinants of the square submatrices of A. In Example 3.1 this would beΔ=1. This means the proximity result in Hochbaum and Shanthikumar (1990) would give us‖x¯-x∗‖∞⩽nwhereas the Rounding Property gives us the stronger bound‖x¯-x∗‖∞⩽1as we know that there is ax∗∈Round(x¯). Note that this stronger bound is due to the fact that we only consider box constraints. While in Hochbaum and Shanthikumar (1990) the results holds for more complicated constraints our result holds for more complicated objective functions than just separable convex ones.Remark 3.1Note that separable convex functions have cross-shaped level sets but the class of functions whose level sets are cross-shaped is much larger – just note that a monotonic norm need not be separable convex to give just one example.Note furthermore that in Theorem 3.1 we only requiredL⩽(z)to be cross-shaped ifz⩽z̃≔min{f(x):x∈Round(x¯)∩F}: we saw in the proof that we do not have to ask for cross-shapedness ifz>z̃. This is another reason why being separable quasiconvex is sufficient, but not necessary to guarantee the rounding property. In particular, in the casen=1the level sets of a functionf:R→Rare cross-shaped for allz⩾f(x¯)if and only if f is quasiconvex.As we already mentioned the rounding property is not at all helpful for Boolean problems(BP)and is also not efficient if n is too large. Unfortunately, cross-shapedness of the intersection of the level sets with the feasible set does usually not lead to the strong rounding property.Hence, we are interested in identifying cross-shaped sets that also guarantee the strong rounding property.Definition 3.2A setM⊆Rnis called coordinate axially symmetric w.r.t. x if for anyy∈Mand for alli∈{1,…,n}it holds that the reflections of y about the hyperplanes, i.e.,z(i)∈Rnwithzj(i)≔yjifj≠i2xj-yjifj=i∀i=1,…,nare in M, i.e., if M is axially symmetric with respect to all axes through x and parallel to the coordinate axes.Just as for cross-shapedness also the axially symmetry is conserved under the following set operations: a set M that is axially symmetric w.r.t.x∈Mcan be scaled (λMis axially symmetric w.r.t.λx) and translated (M+ais axially symmetric w.r.t.x+a) without loosing its cross-shapedness. If several setsMiare axially symmetric with respect to the same pointx0also their intersection and union are axially symmetric w.r.t.x0.In combination with cross-shapedness coordinate axially symmetry guarantees the strong rounding property.Theorem 3.2Let(f,F)be given. Assume that for any optimal solutionx¯to(CP)L⩽(z)∩Fis cross-shaped and coordinate axially symmetric w.r.t.x¯for allz⩽min{f(x):x∈Round(x¯)∩F}. Then(f,F)has the strong rounding property.From Theorem 3.1 we already know that f has the rounding property andRound(x¯)∩F≠∅. It remains to be shown thatx¯∈Fandf(x¯)⩽z̃≔min{f(x):x∈Round(x¯)∩F}.Letx̃∈argmin{f(x):x∈Round(x¯)∩F}. From the definition ofx¯we know that(1)|x̃i-x¯i|⩾|x¯i-x¯i|∀i⩽n.Definey∈Rnasyi≔x̃iifx¯i=x̃i2x¯i-x̃ielse.. Thus,y∈L⩽(z̃)∩Fand asL⩽(z̃)∩Fis cross-shaped w.r.t.x¯we know that[x¯,y]l1⊆L⩽(z̃)∩F. It remains to be shown thatx¯∈[x¯,y]l1, i.e.,x¯i∈[x¯i,yi]ifx¯i⩽yi[yi,x¯i]elsefor alli∈{1,…,n}.Ifx¯i=x̃iwe havex¯i=yiand we are done.Ifx¯i≠x̃iwe haveyi=2x¯i-x̃i.In the case thatx¯i<x¯iwe know thatx̃i<x¯ias bothx¯andx̃are inRound(x¯). Together with (1) this gives usx¯i-x¯i⩽x¯i-x̃i. Hence we haveyi=2x¯i-x̃i⩾x¯iand thusx¯i∈[x¯i,yi]. Analogously we can show that forx¯i<x¯iit holds thatx¯i∈[yi,x¯i].As[x¯,y]l1⊆L⩽(z̃)∩Fthis gives usx¯∈Fandf(x¯)⩽z̃.□A nice application of this result (which will be useful later) is shown next.Lemma 3.3Let‖·‖be a monotonic norm anda∈Rn. Thenf(x)≔‖x-a‖,F≔Rnsatisfy the strong rounding property.From Lemma 3.1 we know that the level sets of f are cross-shaped w.r.t. the continuous minimizer a. In Bauer et al. (1961) it is shown, that every monotonic norm is absolute, i.e.,‖x‖=‖|x|‖for everyx∈Rn. Therefore the level sets of f are also coordinate axially symmetric w.r.t. a. Hence, Theorem 3.2 ends the proof.□We denote bydp(x,M)the‖·‖p-norm distance between x and a setM⊆Rn, i.e.,dp(x,M)≔infy∈M‖x-y‖p, where a minimizer exists if the set M is closed.Corollary 3.1The problem of minimizing a p-norm over the integer lattice has the strong rounding property, i.e.,dp(a,Zn)=‖a-a‖pfor allp⩾1orp=∞.Corollary 3.1 also holds for the familyfp(x)=∑i=1n|xi|p1/pfor0<p<1, i.e., we have thatinfy∈Znfp(y-a)=fp(a-a).Example 3.2Considerf(x)≔min{q1(x),…,qk(x)}whereqi(x)=x⊤Diag(ai)xfori=1,…,kwithai∈R+n. Note that the level sets of each of theqiare axis-parallel ellipsoids as mentioned before. The level sets of f are therefore cross-shaped and coordinate axially symmetric w.r.t. 0.Now we consider the problem(IP)min{f(x-b):x∈F,x∈Zn}, where we assume that F is cross-shaped and coordinate axially symmetric w.r.t. b. It is obvious that b is the unique continuous minimizer. As mentioned before:L⩽,f(z)=⋃j=1,…,kL⩽,qk(z)is cross-shaped and coordinate axially symmetric w.r.t. b. Therefore also the intersection with F is coordinate axially symmetric and cross-shaped and thus the problem has the strong rounding property and an optimal solution is given byb, see the example in Fig. 2.If F is cross-shaped but not coordinate axially symmetric w.r.t. b we get that the problem has the rounding property and that an optimal solution to (IP) is inRound(b).It is important to remark that cross-shapedness is sufficient for the rounding property but not at all necessary. An example for a completely different geometric shape which also guarantees the rounding property is provided in the next section.We have seen in Corollary 3.1 that functions of the formf(x)=‖x-a‖pfor somea∈Rnand1⩽p(orp=∞) have the strong rounding property. This raises the question: is it possible to relax the requirement of being “round” (in any p-norm sense) but maintain at least the rounding property?To this end let us denote the ball about x with respect to the norm‖·‖pand radius r byBp(x,r)≔{y∈Rn:‖x-y‖p⩽r}.Definition 4.1Givenα⩾0andp⩾1(orp=∞), we call a setM⊆Rn(α,p)-quasiround w.r.t. a centerx0if there exist radiir∈RandR∈R0+such thatBp(x0,r)⊆M⊆Bp(x0,R)andR-r⩽α.Quasiround sets need not be connected and it depends on the given p whether a set is quasiround or not (for an illustration see Fig. 3).Example 4.1In Buchheim et al. (2013) it is shown, that the ellipsoidE(Q,x)≔{y∈Rn:(y-x)⊤Q(y-x)⩽1}forQ∈Rn,nsymmetric and positive definite andx∈Rnis(α,2)-quasiround if and only if1λmax-1λmin⩽αwhereλ1,…,λndenote the eigenvalues of Q andλmin=miniλiandλmax=maxiλi.Again we are mainly interested in identifying functions whose level sets are quasiround.Example 4.2As an example consider a function which is disturbed by some noise, for examplef(x)=‖x-a‖p+∊(x)where∊:Rn→[-∊1,∊2],x↦∊(x)is a (small) disturbance such that∊2+∊1⩽α. This means,Bp(a,z-∊2)⊆L⩽(z)⊆Bp(a,z+∊1)∀z∈Rand by definition it follows(z+∊1)-(z-∊2)=∊1+∊2⩽αfor allz∈R, i.e., f is(α,p)-quasiround.Consider for example the following two realizations of∊(x)disturbing the Euclidean norm inR2:•∊(x)=∊and∊∼U(-∊1,∊2), i.e.,∊is a typical noise added to the function.∊(x)depends continuously on the angle betweenx-aand a fixed axis which may be interpreted as a disturbance of the level set.Compare the examples given in Fig. 4.As mentioned before we want to show that quasiroundness (just as cross-shapedness in the previous section) guarantees the rounding property.Theorem 4.1Let(f,F)be given. Assume that for any optimal solutionx¯to(CP)and for any levelz⩽min{f(x):x∈Round(x¯)∩F}there existsp∈N∪{∞}such thatL⩽(z)∩Fis(αp,p)-quasiround with centerx¯and with(2)αp≔miny∈Rndpy,Zn⧹Round(y)-dpy,Zn.Then(f,F)has the rounding property.Note thatαp⩾0, hence(αp,p)-quasiroundness is well-defined.ProofChoose any optimal solutionx¯to(CP). We show that the equivalent condition (i) of Lemma 2.1 holds. Letx∈Zn∩Fbe an arbitrary (feasible) point andz̃∈min{f(u):u∈Round(x¯)∩F}. Assume thatz̃>f(x). Then we have(1)x∉Round(x¯)andthere arep∈IN∪{∞},r∈RandR∈R0+withBp(x¯,r)⊆L⩽(f(x))∩F⊆Bp(x¯,R)andR-r⩽αp.From Lemma 3.3 we know thatdp(x¯,Zn)=‖x¯-x¯‖p. By definition ofαpwe hence obtainαp⩽dp(x¯,Zn⧹Round(x¯))-dp(x¯,Zn)=dp(x¯,Zn⧹Round(x¯))-‖x¯-x¯‖p.Then‖x¯-x¯‖p⩽dp(x¯,Zn⧹Round(x¯))-αp⩽‖x¯-x‖p-αp⩽R-αp⩽r.Thereforex¯∈Bp(x¯,r)⊆L⩽(f(x))∩F(and henceRound(x¯)∩F≠∅) and thusf(x¯)⩽f(x)<z̃. But asx¯∈Round(x¯)and we just showedx¯∈F, we also havez̃⩽f(x¯). Together we obtainz̃⩽f(x¯)⩽f(x)<z̃, a contradiction.□It is important to observe here that we allow a different p for each level.Furthermore, we explain at this point why we restrict the absolute differenceR-rin the definition of quasiroundness and not the ratiorRas it is done for example in the definition of the asphericity of M (compare (Dvoretzky, 1963)). Actually both possibilities can be used to guarantee the rounding property, since we only have to make sure that as soon asR⩾minx∈Zn⧹Round(x¯)‖x-x¯‖pwe have thatr⩾minx∈Zn‖x-x¯‖p- compare again the proof of Theorem 4.1. Hence we would have to require(3)rR⩾minx∈Zn‖x-x¯‖pminx∈Zn⧹Round(x¯)‖x-x¯‖pinstead of(4)R-r⩽minx∈Zn⧹Round(x¯)‖x-x¯‖p-minx∈Zn‖x-x¯‖p.In Theorem 4.1 we are interested in the caseR⩽minx∈Zn⧹Round(x¯)‖x-x¯‖p, for which one can easily verify that (3) implies (4), hence the bound on r given by the restriction ofrRis stricter than the one given by the restriction ofR-rand we conclude that using the absolute difference gives a weaker condition for the rounding property than using the asphericity.The proof of Theorem 4.1 works because we have chosenαpthe way it “fits”. However without knowing the value ofαpit is not helpful. To use the theorem in practice it is therefore very important to determineαp. We start by analyzing the expression in (2) for a fixed point y and then computeαpby minimizing over all y.Lemma 4.1For a giveny∈Rnandp⩾1we haveαp(y)≔dp(y,Zn⧹Round(y))-dp(y,Zn)=(ai+1)p+∑j≠iajpp-∑j=1najppwhereaj≔yj-yjandai⩽ajfor allj=1,…,n.By Lemma 3.3 we havedp(y,Zn)=‖y-y‖p.Now we determinedp(y,Zn⧹Round(y)): defineaj≔yj-yjand leti∈argminj=1,…,naj. Thenz̃withz̃j≔⌈yi⌉+1ifj=iandyi=⌈yi⌉⌊yi⌋-1ifj=iandyi=⌊yi⌋⌈yj⌉ifj≠iandyj=⌈yj⌉⌊yj⌋ifj≠iandyj=⌊yj⌋fulfillsz̃∈argminz∈Zn⧹Round(y)‖z-y‖p.In order to prove this assertion some simple calculus shows thatz̃∈Zn⧹Round(y)and that‖z̃-y‖p⩽‖z-y‖pfor allz∈Zn⧹Round(y).This meansαp(y)=‖z̃-y‖p-‖y-y‖p=(ai+1)p+∑j≠iajpp-∑j=1najpp.□Forp⩾1we haveαp=(n-1)·0.5p+1p-(n-1)·0.5pp.Sinceαp≔minx∈Rnαp(x)we have to solve(Pp)min(1+ai)p+∑j≠iajpp-∑j=1najpps.t.0⩽ai⩽aj⩽0.5∀j=1,…,n.Forp=1we directly see that the optimal objective value of(P1)is 1 and thusα1=1.Forp>1we consider first the problemminb+xp-c+xp:l⩽t⩽u, withl⩾0andb>c⩾0. The objective function decreases withx⩾0asddxb+xp-c+xp=1p(b+x)1p-1-(c+x)1p-1⩽0(since1p-1<0) and hence the minimum is attained whenx=u. So, in our problem the optimal a statisfiesaj=0.5forj≠iand we are left withmin(1+ai)p+dp-aip+dp:0⩽ai⩽0.5whered=(n-1)·0.5p. This function ofaiis differentiable and its derivative is(1+ai)p+d1p-1(1+ai)p-1-(aip+d)1p-1aip-1which is obviously nonnegative whenai⩾0. So the minimum is attained forai=0, hence the result follows.□We remark that forp=2this theorem gives usα2=0.5(n+3-n-1). An example using this result is the following.Example 4.3The following family of functions is given in a recent paper by Baes et al. (2012): let f be strongly convex and differentiable, have Lipschitz-continuous gradient and fulfill the inequality∇f(y)⊤(x-y)+l2‖x-y‖22⩽f(x)-f(y)⩽∇f(y)⊤(x-y)+L2‖x-y‖22for allx,y∈Rnfor universal scalars0⩽l⩽Las in Baes et al. (2012) and assume thatx¯is the continuous minimizer of f. (The minimizer is unique as f is strongly convex.) Then we get∇f(x¯)=0and for ally≠x¯:l2‖x¯-y‖22⩽f(y)-f(x¯)⩽L2‖x¯-y‖22and thereforeB2x¯,2L(z-f(x¯))⊆L⩽,f(z)⊆B2x¯,2l(z-f(x¯)). This means, ifl,Lsatisfy1l-1L⩽α22(f(x̃)-f(x¯))the level sets of f are(α2,2)-quasiround for allz⩽f(x̃). Consequently, f has the rounding property and hence the discrete nonlinear optimization problemminx∈Znf(x)can be solved by finding its continuous minimizer and rounding it.We finally consider the case ofp=∞.Lemma 4.2An optimal solution for(P∞)isx=(x1,…,xn)withxi=xi+0.5for onei∈{1,…,n}andxj∈Zfor allj∈{1,…,n}⧹{i}. The optimal objective value isα∞=0.5.“⩾”: We have thatminx∈Rn{d∞(x,Zn⧹Round(x))-d∞(x,Zn)}⩾minx∈Rn{d∞(x,Zn⧹Round(x))}-maxx∈Rn{d∞(x,Zn)}.‖x-y‖∞<1impliesy∈Round(x), henceminx∈Rn{miny∈Zn⧹Round(x)‖y-x‖∞}⩾1.On the other handmaxx∈Rn{miny∈Zn‖y-x‖∞}⩽0.5sinceminy∈Zn‖y-x‖∞⩽‖x-x‖∞and|xi-xi|⩽0.5for all i and therefore‖x-x‖∞⩽0.5for allx∈Rn.Togetherα∞⩾1-0.5=0.5.“⩽”: Consider for examplex≔(0.5,1,…,1). Then we can computed∞(x,Zn⧹Round(x))-d∞(x,Zn)=0.5. Thus,α∞⩽0.5.□Another interesting question is to ask in which cases the strong rounding property holds. Do functions with quasiround level sets have the strong rounding property? The answer is no, as the example in Fig. 5shows. Note that these level sets are also axially symmetric w.r.t.x¯but nevertheless the function does not have the strong rounding property.In this paper we used geometric considerations in order to identify functions that have the rounding property, i.e., functions that guarantee that we can find an optimal solution for the integer problem by solving the continuous problem and then comparing only the integer points adjacent to the continuous minimizer. This has the advantage that the complexity of the integer problem is (more or less) given by the complexity of the continuous relaxation. One goal is to increase the class of functions having the rounding property. To this end, we investigate howαpin the definition of quasi-roundness depends on F and to use these properties to come up with a larger value forαp.Other functions with known level sets are also under investigation. Among others we analyze convex quadratic integer programming problems in Buchheim et al. (2013) and use our approach to improve the bounds given in Buchheim et al. (2012).The definition of the (strong) rounding property might sometimes be too restrictive because it has to hold for all optimal solutions. We might instead say that a functionf:Rn→Rhas the (strong) specific rounding property if there exists an optimal solutionx¯to(CP)such that there is an optimal solutionx∗to(IP)withx∗∈Round(x¯)orx∗=x¯respectively (see also (Hübner, 2010)).The advantage of this definition is that it is less restrictive then Definition 2.1 and so it is satisfied by a larger class of functions. If a function f has the rounding property then it certainly also has the specific rounding property. Moreover, both definitions are equivalent if(CP)has only one optimal solution. The disadvantage is that it is no longer sufficient to find an arbitrary continuous minimizer but we have to find the specific one that gives the function f the required property. This is ongoing research.Another interesting question is how to apply our results to mixed integer problems. This means we consider problems of the following type:(MIP)min{f(x,y):(x,y)∈S∩(Zn1×Rn2)}. Take for example (as in Example 3.1) a functionf:R2→Rwhose level sets are balls (for examplef(x)≔‖x-x¯‖2) with the additional constraintx1∈Z.We see thatx̃=(x¯1,x¯2)is an optimal solution to(MIP)min{‖x-x¯‖2:x∈Z×R}. This means that here we also get an optimal solution for(MIP)by rounding the solution for the continuous counterpart but with the difference that we round only the coordinates that are required to be integer.
