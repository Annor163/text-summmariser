Stochastic Model Predictive (STOMP) glycaemic control for the intensive care unit: Development and virtual trial validation

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Stochastic Model Predictive (STOMP) is a glycaemic control protocol that combines the probabilistic, stochastic forecasting methods of previous methods (STAR) with model predictive control, for ease of tuning.Clinically validated virtual trials were used to evaluate the relative performance of STOMP.Results showed STOMP was able to obtain results very similar to STAR with both protocols maintaining approximately 85% of time within 4.4–8.0mmol/L glycaemic band.STOMP was able to attain similar results to STAR while further increasing ease of controller tuning for different clinical requirements and reducing the number of BG measurements required by 35%.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Critically ill patients often experience stress-induced hyperglycaemia, which results in increased morbidity and mortality. Glycaemic control (GC) can be implemented in the intensive care unit (ICU) to safely manage hyperglycaemia. Two protocols SPRINT and STAR, have been implemented in the Christchurch ICU, and have been successful in treating hyperglycaemia while decreasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. This paper presents a new GC protocol that implements the probabilistic, stochastic forecasting methods of STAR, while formalizing the control methodology using model predictive control (MPC) theory to improve the ability to tune the dynamic response of the controller. This Stochastic Model Predictive (STOMP) controller predicts the response to a given insulin/nutrition intervention, and attributes weighted penalty values to several key performance metrics. The controller thus chooses an intervention at each hour that minimizes the sum of these penalties over a prediction window of 6h, which is twice as long as the 3-h window used in STAR. Clinically validated virtual trials were used to evaluate the relative performance of STOMP. Results showed STOMP was able to obtain results very similar to STAR with both protocols maintaining approximately 85% of time within 4.4–8.0mmol/L glycaemic band, and only 4–5 patients of the 149 patient STAR cohort having blood glucose (BG) <2.2mmol/L. STOMP was able to attain similar results to STAR while further increasing ease of controller tuning for different clinical requirements and reducing the number of BG measurements required by 35%.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Critically ill patients often experience stress-induced hyperglycaemia and high levels of insulin resistance [1–7]. The occurrence of hyperglycaemia, predominantly severe hyperglycaemia, is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality in this group of patients [1,3]. Glycaemic variability, and thus poor control, is also independently associated with an increase in mortality [8,9].It has been shown that effective glycaemic control (GC) can significantly reduce the number of negative outcomes associated with poor control by modulating nutrition and/or insulin administration [7,10,11]. Effective GC can also lead to a reduction in the rate and severity of organ failure [12] and the cost of care [13,14]. However, consistent, safe and effective GC remains elusive with several other studies achieving negative, or inconclusive outcomes [15–20]. In addition, there is little agreement on what constitutes desirable glycaemic performance [21–23], particularly with regard to how GC affects outcome.The model-derived SPRINT protocol has been successful at reducing organ failure and mortality [10,12] with a patient-specific approach, providing the tightest control across all patients of several large studies [24,25]. As a series of interactive charts, the SPRINT protocol allowed nutrition and insulin interventions to be tailored to current patient condition. However, as a paper-based protocol, SPRINT was relatively inflexible to different desired blood glucose targets and clinical uses, and required a relatively high nurse workload with 1–2 hourly blood glucose (BG) measurements.The Stochastic TARgeted (STAR) glycaemic control protocol was thus developed to address these issues [26,27]. STAR recommends an intervention based on a clinically specified maximum risk of mild hypoglycaemia (e.g. BG<4.4mmol/L), derived from stochastic model predictions of future insulin sensitivity [28,29]. With the ability to quantify the probability of hypoglycaemia, STAR allows aggressive yet safe control of blood glucose within a target band. STAR is flexible to different blood glucose targets [30,31] and nursing intervention frequency, and thus, addresses many of the areas for improvement with the SPRINT protocol. However, the intervention selection algorithm used by STAR is fixed and does not allow for dynamic tuning, which limits the capacity for the controller to be further optimized in real time.Model predictive control (MPC) is an alternative control approach that allows the dynamic response of the controller to be easily tuned through a series of clinically pre-defined cost functions. MPC utilizes a mathematical model of a system to forecast the response to a given input, and control interventions are chosen to produce optimal forecasted results. Commonly, optimization will involve specifying weighted (cost) functions to key input and output performance metrics, and choosing an intervention that minimizes the sum of these values. The benefit of such a system is that the cost functions can be easily optimized to produce robust and consistent control outcomes from an intuitively easily understood clinical specification. This type of controller was chosen due to the flexibility of cost functions in allowing the dynamic response of the controller to be easily tuned. MPC has also been used for glycaemic control with a different model [32–35].This article presents a Stochastic Model Predictive (STOMP) GC protocol that uses a low error, infrequently measured, BG signal to control the BG levels in adult ICU patients while providing greater flexibility than STAR. This research presents the protocol design and optimization for an adult ICU using clinically validated [36] virtual trials to amend safety and efficacy before clinical uptake.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
An MPC glycaemic control protocol was developed and optimized for an adult BG signal in the ICU using the virtual trial approach. The STOMP protocol was designed as a model-predictive evolution of STAR that permits controller response to be easily tuned to specific, clinically relevant performance metrics. It has the additional benefit of formalizing the heuristic control algorithm of STAR, and being a much more generalizable approach. The results indicate STOMP retains the performance and safety of STAR with approximately 85% time in the 4.4–8.0mmol/L glycaemic band and 0.06% time <2.2mmol/L, with 35% fewer BG measurements. This protocol is a promising start that enables the development a more easily customized GC alternatives within an existing, proven model-based GC framework.
