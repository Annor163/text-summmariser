@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This article describes in-depth research on machine learning methods for sentiment analysis of Czech social media. Whereas in English, Chinese, or Spanish this field has a long history and evaluation datasets for various domains are widely available, in the case of the Czech language no systematic research has yet been conducted. We tackle this issue and establish a common ground for further research by providing a large human-annotated Czech social media corpus. Furthermore, we evaluate state-of-the-art supervised machine learning methods for sentiment analysis. We explore different pre-processing techniques and employ various features and classifiers. We also experiment with five different feature selection algorithms and investigate the influence of named entity recognition and preprocessing on sentiment classification performance. Moreover, in addition to our newly created social media dataset, we also report results for other popular domains, such as movie and product reviews. We believe that this article will not only extend the current sentiment analysis research to another family of languages, but will also encourage competition, potentially leading to the production of high-end commercial solutions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Sentiment analysis has become a mainstream research field since the early 2000s. Its impact can be seen in many practical applications, ranging from analyzing product reviews (Stepanov & Riccardi, 2011) to predicting sales and stock markets using social media monitoring (Yu, Wu, Chang, & Chu, 2013). The users’ opinions are mostly extracted either on a certain polarity scale, or binary (positive, negative); various levels of granularity are also taken into account, e.g., document-level, sentence-level, or aspect-based sentiment (Hajmohammadi, Ibrahim, & Othman, 2012).Most of the research in automatic sentiment analysis of social media has been performed in English and Chinese, as shown by several recent surveys, i.e., (Liu & Zhang, 2012; Tsytsarau & Palpanas, 2012). In Czech, there have been very few attempts, although the importance of sentiment analysis of social media became apparent, for example, during the recent presidential elections.1http://www.mediaguru.cz/2013/01/analyza-facebook-rozhodne-o-volbe-prezidenta/ [in Czech].1Many Czech companies also discovered a huge potential in social media marketing and started launching campaigns, contests, and even customer support on Facebook—the dominant social network of the Czech online community with approximately 3.6 million users.2http://www.m-journal.cz/cs/jaky-je-skutecny-pocet-ceskych-uzivatelu-facebooku__s288x9161.html [in Czech].2One aspect still eludes many of them: automatic analysis of customer sentiment of products, services, or even a brand or a company name. In many cases, sentiment is still labeled manually, according to one of the leading Czech companies for social media monitoring.Automatic sentiment analysis in the Czech environment has not yet been thoroughly targeted by the research community. Therefore it is necessary to create a publicly available labeled dataset as well as to evaluate the current state of the art for two reasons. First, many NLP methods must deal with high flection and rich syntax when processing the Czech language. Dealing with these issues may lead to novel approaches to sentiment analysis as well. Second, freely accessible and well-documented datasets, as known from many shared NLP tasks, may stimulate competition, which usually leads to the production of cutting-edge solutions.3E.g., named entity recognition based on Conditional Random Fields emerged from CoNLL-2003 named entity recognition shared task.3This article focuses on document-level4Or post-level, as documents correspond to posts in social media.4sentiment analysis performed on three different Czech datasets using supervised machine learning. For the first dataset, we created a Facebook corpus consisting of 10,000 posts. The dataset was manually labeled by two annotators. The other two datasets come from online databases of movie and product reviews, whose sentiment labels were derived from the accompanying star ratings from users of the databases. We provide all these labeled datasets under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licence5http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/.5at http://liks.fav.zcu.cz/sentiment.The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the related work with a focus on Czech research and social media. Section 3 thoroughly describes the datasets and the annotation process. In Section 4, we list the employed features and describe our approach to classification. Section 5 contains the results and provides a thorough discussion. Finally, Section 5.3 explores the influence of feature selection methods.
