@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We present the mechanism of interaction of Wnt network module, which is responsible for periodic somitogenesis, with p53 regulatory network, which is one of the main regulators of various cellular functions, and switching of various oscillating states by investigating p53–Wnt model. The variation in Nutlin concentration in p53 regulating network drives the Wnt network module to different states, stabilized, damped and sustain oscillation states, and even to cycle arrest. Similarly, the change in Axin2 concentration in Wnt could able to modulate the p53 dynamics at these states. We then solve the set of coupled ordinary differential equations of the model using quasi steady state approximation. We, further, demonstrate the change of p53 and GSK3 interaction rate, due to hypothetical catalytic reaction or external stimuli, can able to regulate the dynamics of the two network modules, and even can control their dynamics to protect the system from cycle arrest (apoptosis).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
p53, one of the largest hub in cellular network (Collavin et al., 2010; Oren et al., 2002), is considered to be one of the most important key regulators of cellular metabolic pathways (Itahana et al., 2001; Vogelstein et al., 2000), regulates a number of cellular functions (Agarwal et al., 1998) and its dynamics control even the fate of the cell when stress is given to the cell (Purvis et al., 2012). Further, p53 suppression is observed in various types of cancer either due to mutations or by ambiguous expression of control systems like MDM2 (or HDM2 its human equivalent) (Lowe et al., 2004). p53 is negatively regulated by the MDM2 (Momand et al., 2000), and MDM2 functions as an E3 ligase which mediates the proteosomic degradation of p53 (Toledo and Wahl, 2006; Honda et al., 1997), facilitates the diffusion of p53 in the nucleus (Kobet et al., 2000), which in turn lowers the level of p53 within the cell (Oliner et al., 1992). In stressed cells, the p53 triggers the cell to cell cycle arrest forcing it to choose its fate, either to repair or apoptosis (Chen et al., 1996; Haupt et al., 1996; Arora et al., 2013).p53 dynamics is regulated by various signaling molecules as evident from various experimental and theoretical reports (Oren, 2003). One of the most important inhibitor of p53–MDM2 is nutlin (Shangary and Wang, 2009). It is a selective small molecule which directly binds to binding pocket of MDM2 (Momand et al., 1992), to activate p53 pathway (Momand et al., 1992; Vassilev et al., 2004), and inhibiting p53 binding to MDM2 (Logan et al., 2007). Nutlin−3a and 3b are the two most active enantiomorphs that are found to up-regulate the p53 in p53 dependent manner i.e. Nutlins (3a and 3b) allows to increase the response or activation of p53 pathways (Villalonga-Planells et al., 2011). Further, it is also demonstrated that Nutlin-3 induces anti-angiogenic activities in endothelial cells probably via three mechanisms; first by inhibiting endothelial cell migration; second by inducing cell cycle arrest; and third by increasing apoptotic tendency in endothelial cells (Binder, 2007). Further, it was also shown that Nutlin-3 treatment in these cells leads to accumulation of p53 (Lee et al., 2013), indicating the important impacts of Nutlin-3 which interferences the p53–MDM2 regulatory mechanism. As a consequence, it was shown that Nutlin-3 stabilizes the p53 dynamics and causes the activation of survival pathways (Lee et al., 2013).Somitogenesis in vertebrates is periodic formation of somites (vertabrae precursors) in the anterior presomitic mesoderm tissue (PSM) controlled by complex gene network known as segmentation clock (Aulehla and Pourquie, 2008), where, Notch, Wnt pathways (Gibb et al., 2009, 2010) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) are the main components (Goldbeter and Pourquie, 2008). Further, it has been shown that these three main pathways generate rhythms of specific oscillation relationships (Goldbeter and Pourquie, 2008), and cross-talk among them (Dequeant et al., 2006) as a basis of spatio-temporal self-organization of patterns during somitogenesis (Pourquie, 2003). This physiological oscillations is responsible for periodic spacing of somites, dynamic structures and regular segmented development in vertebrates (Pourquie, 2003). In some studies in normal (stress) and cancerous cells, it has been reported that p53 and Wnt modules are being coupled and cross-talk between them via different intermediate proteins or genes or signaling molecules (Peng et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2011; Cha et al., 2012). The studies also reported that p53 network suppresses the Wnt signaling cascade (Kim et al., 2011). The Wnt signaling plays a pivotal role in determination of cell fate, which may probably through p53 interaction (Kim et al., 2011; Cha et al., 2012), but still it is not clear yet. Further, several other works reported that the intercellular signaling of Wnt depends on the β-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3) (Tauriello and Maurice, 2010). Moreover, p53 can regulate the dynamics of Axin2 and GSK3 (Kim et al., 2013). Recently, it is also reported that the miR−34 family, which is directly transcribed by the p53, links p53 with Wnt signaling (Cha et al., 2012), in this process, and a set of GSK3-related Wnt genes, are directly targeted by p53 and miR−34. These observations clearly suggest the close connection between the p53 functionalities and Wnt in stress and cancer cells (Peng et al., 2014; Cha et al., 2012). However, the way how p53 interacts with Wnt during somitogenesis and its impact on somite organization/reorganization at molecular level is still an open question.GSK3, which is an important coupling molecule between p53 and Wnt pathways, is widely expressed in broad range of cellular processes and being a Ser/Thr kinase it is a multifunctional protein (Doble and Woodgett, 2003; Woodgett, 2001). It is active under resting condition and act as a core regulator in various disease pathways like cancer (Doble and Woodgett, 2003). Being a kinase, it confers selectivity and substrate specificity (Doble and Woodgett, 2003). It also largely acts as a phosphorylating and an important signaling agent for the degradation of large number of proteins, such as β-catenin in Wnt pathway (Aberle et al., 1997). Further, it is a central player in Wnt signaling pathway recruited with the Axin2 at the Frizzle receptor for the activation of Wnt signaling (Nakamura et al., 1998). In absence of Wnt signals GSK3 shows its activity in the protein destruction complex with Axin2, APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) and other partners mediating the destruction and phosphorylation of β-catenin (Taelman et al., 2010). GSK3 also mediates p53 dependent apoptosis signaling by suppressing p53-AKT pathway. The role GSK3 as a mediator of p53 and Wnt cross-talk is not fully understood. The impact of other Wnt regulators in Wnt pathway and how they regulate p53 dynamics, and vice versa, are needed to be investigated in order to understand how segmentation clock works.Previous model have not yet modeled the effect of synthetic molecule (like nutlin3a) on the coupling of p53 and Wnt oscillator together. They have only accessed the external stimulus using Dsh via Wnt as surface receptor. We have provided the external stress from Nutlin−3a. Our model also throws some light the control of p53 oscillator on intoxication created by the β-catenin inside cell during somatogenesis. Our model for the first time couples the effect of p53 on affiliated β-catenin degradation via Gsk3, β-catenin to decrease toxicity in the cells. Since wnt is the key player in the recruitment of many other down regulated proteins or molecules like Axin2 and GSK3 and not much is known about its regulation experimentally So, We have tried to figure out the interaction of two oscillators via GSK3. Since we want to focus on somatogenesis. Our model gives an understanding of the underlying process of somite formation and also the regulation of the two oscillator to get information on pattern recognition.We study the coupling of Wnt oscillator which is one of the three important clocks in somitogenesis in vertebrates and p53 regulatory network to understand how does these two oscillators regulates each other and process information during somite formation and pattern organization. Since p53 interferes various other cellular functions, it will be interesting to understand its regulating impacts on segmentation clock and vice versa. Presently we study these phenomena by modeling this p53–Wnt two oscillator model with updated interaction between them from various experimental reports and how do they regulate each other. We organize our work as follows. The detailed description of the model and techniques is provided in materials and methods section. It is followed by mathematical treatment of the model, the numerical simulation results and its discussion in the next section. We then draw come conclusions based on the results we obtained and discussion on it.The Wnt signaling pathway is authorized by β-catenin regulation via various intermediate interaction steps (Fig. 1) (Logan et al., 2007; Jensen et al., 2010). In this signal processing, Wnt promotes the synthesis of Dishevelled (Dsh) protein, and then inhibits GSK3 protein kinase (Goldbeter and Pourquie, 2008). GSK3, then interacts with Axin2 (with rate constant K1 and K2 for forward and backward reactions as in Fig. 1) in the presence of β-catenin to form transient complex which in turn phosphorylates β-catenin into β-catenin-P (with rate constant K6) (Goldbeter and Pourquie, 2008; Jensen et al., 2010). The β-catenin-P degraded quickly with rate constant K14, on the other hand it is dephosphorylated with rate constant K11 to form free β-catenin and then degraded with a rate constant K13 (Clevers, 2006). The free β-catenin is then transported to nucleus (β-catenin-n) with rate constant K4, on the other hand β-catenin-n is transported from nucleus to cytoplasm with another rate constant K5. Then β-catenin-n promotes the transcription of set of target genes including mAxin2 (mRNA of Axin2, specifically homolog Axin2 in PSM tissue) at the rate constant K15, with rate constant K16, and mAxin2 also degrades with a rate constant K18 (Huelsken and Behrens, 2002). On the other hand mAxin2 translates to Axin2 with a rate constant k22, Axin2 protein which also degrades with a rate constant K23. This mechanism of Axin2 is just like a negative feedback loop which drives the oscillations in the network components. Thus Axin2 is the essential target of the Wnt pathway because it inhibits the Wnt signals by degrading the β-catenin by forming a negative feedback loop (Wang et al., 2013).The Wnt pathway communicates with the p53 oscillator (Proctor and Gray, 2008; Alam et al., 2013; Devi et al., 2015) through GSK3 by formation of a binary complex p53–GSK3 with the free available p53 at the rate constant k39. Then this complex p53–GSK3 dissociates at the rate constant k40 to the free p53 and GSK3 proteins (Proctor and Gray, 2010). p53 and MDM2 regulate each other with feedback mechanism where formation and decay of various intermediate complexes are involved with different rate constant (Fig. 1) as described in Tables 1 and 2(Proctor and Gray, 2008). The freely synthesized Nutlin directly interacts with MDM2 with a rate constant k36 to form a complex Nut_MDM2, and then this complex dissociates to release back free Nutlin and MDM2. Then Nutlin indirectly interacts with p53 via MDM2 by affecting the feedback mechanism between p53 and MDM2. The Nutlin then degrades with rate constant k38. Thus the activated p53 can now go to the nucleus and initiate the transcription of a number of target genes including MDM2. MDM2 is essential in controlling the concentration of p53 through a positive feedback loop mechanism by making complex (Chickarmane et al., 2005; Lahav et al., 2004).The stress p53–Wnt regulating network our study is defined by N=13 molecular species (Table 1) corresponding to the reaction network description provided in Table 2. The state of the system at any instant of time t is given by the state vector,x→(t)=(x1,x2,…,xN)T, where, N=13 and t is the transpose of the vector. By considering feedback mechanism of in p53 and Wnt oscillators and coupling reaction channels of the two oscillators, we could able to reach the following coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE),(1)ddtx→(t)=F1F2⋮F13where, the functions in Eq. (1) {Fi(x1, x2, …, xN)}, i=1, 2, …, 13 are given by,(2)F1=k26k22x2−k23x1k24+x1−k1x1x6+k2k8−x6(3)F2=k26k15+k16x5k25k17k25+x5k25−k18x2k19+x2(4)F3=k26k3−k6k9k9+k7x3k10+x3k8−x6k8+k11x4k12+x4−k4x3+k5x5−k13x3(5)F4=k26k6k9k9+k7x3k10+x3k8−x6k8−k11x4k12+x4−k14x4(6)F5=k26k4x3−k5x5(7)F6=k26−k1x1x6+k2k8−k2x6−k39x7x6+k40x13(8)F7=k31−k33x7x8+k34x10−k39x7x6+k40x13(9)F8=k27x9−k30x8+k32x10−k33x7x8+k34x10−k36x11x8+k37x12(10)F9=k28x7−k29x9+k41x13(11)F10=−k32x10+k33x7x8−k34x10(12)F11=k35−k36x11x8+k37x12−k38x11(13)F12=k36x11x8−k37x12(14)F13=k39x7x6−k40x13The coupled ODEs (Eq. (1)) are very difficult to solve analytically. However, one can get approximate analytical solution of these equations by using quasi-steady state approximation (Murray, 2003; Schauer and Heinrich, 1983). In general, any biochemical reactions network involves two basic types of reaction, namely slow and fast reactions (Murray, 2003). Therefore, the N=13 variables in the system can be divided into sets of slow and fast variables respectively. Ifx→s(t)=(x1,x2,…,xl)Tandx→f(t)=(xl+1,xl+2,…,xN)Tare slow and fast variable vectors, thenx→(t)=(x→s,x→f)T. Then from Eq. (1) to (14)) along with Table 1, we have,(15)x→s(t)=x1x3x6x7x8x11;x→f(t)=x2x4x5x9x10x12x13Since the rate constant of complex formation is fast, and after this fast complex formation, the fast variables immediately retain steady state (equilibrium). Then using Henri–Michaelis–Menten–Briggs–Haldane approximation (Pedersen et al., 2007), one can take quite fair assumption that the ODEs of variables of complex molecular species reach steady state equilibrium quite fast compared with the time evolution of slow variables (Murray, 2003). Then one can straight forward put,dx→fdt≈0(Pedersen et al., 2007; Murray, 2003). Now, the number of coupled ODE (1) reduces to the following,(16)x→(t)dt=x→s(t)dt=ddtx1x3x6x7x8x11and thex→fbecome the following steady state values,(17)x→f→x2*x4*x5*x9*x10*x12*x13*→constantThe 13 ordinary differential equations are now reduced to six ordinary differential equations. This allows to simplify the complex mathematical model to get approximate solutions of the system numerically saving computational cost or analytically from the reduced system if possible.We used standard Runge–Kutta method (order 4) of numerical integration to simulate Eq. (1) to find the solution of the variables listed in Table 1 for the parameter values given in Table 2. We then analysed the constructed mathematical model to get possible approximate analytical solutions of the variables (slow variables) using quasi-steady state approximation.
