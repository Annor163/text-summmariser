@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Recently, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has been one of the more popular applications in Internet technology. For VoIP and other IP applications, issues surrounding Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) have received significant attention. SIP is a widely used signaling protocol and is capable of operating on Internet Telephony, typically using Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) digest authentication protocol. Authentication is becoming increasingly crucial because it accesses the server when a user asks to use SIP services. In this paper, we concentrate on the security flaws in the current SIP authentication procedure. We propose a secure ECC-based authentication mechanism to conquer many forms of attacks in previous schemes. By a sophisticated analysis of the security of the ECC-based protocol, we show that it is suitable for applications with higher security requirements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] is a signaling-based protocol which can establish, modify, and terminate multimedia user sessions at the application layer and can handle all of the signaling requirements of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). With regard to the widely used VoIP application, there have been numerous studies dealing with SIP issues, for instance, authentication problems. Typically, SIP uses the HTTP digest authentication protocol noted in RFC2617 [2] for identity authentication. Several studies have proven that HTTP digest authentication cannot resist off-line password guessing attacks or server spoofing attacks using the HTTP protocol [3–5]. In 2005, Yang [6] proposed a Diffie–Hellman key exchange [7] authentication protocol and Durlanik and Sogukpinar [8] proposed an Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key exchange authentication protocol to resolve these problems. Later, [9,10] found that Yang's protocol was vulnerable to the replay attack and [11] found that Durlanik and Sogukpinar's protocol was vulnerable to the stolen-verifier attack and Denning–Sacco attack. In 2006, Ring et al. [10] provided an Agreement Key (AK) protocol for SIP authentication which used identity-based cryptography (IBC) [12]. It calculated the user's SIP identity with a hash function as the public key. However, Ring et al.'s protocol has been found to be vulnerable to the impersonating attack [12–15], and the computation cost is heavy on bilinear pairing and identity-based signature calculation. To solve these problems, Wang and Zhang [16] proposed a new Secure Authentication and Key Agreement (SAKA) mechanism based on Certificate-Less Public Key Cryptography (CL-PKC) [17]. Wang and Zhang's protocol used the Bilinear Diffie–Hellman (BDH) method to encrypt/decrypt private keys and public keys generated by the Key Generating Center (KGC). Such a protocol can overcome the impersonating attack issue but it suffers from heavy computation cost. In 2009, Tsai [18] proposed a nonce-based authentication protocol for SIP. However, Lee [19] found that Tsai's protocol still suffered from password guessing attacks and insider attacks, so Tsai's protocol is not suitable for SIP.Since Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) provides a smaller key size than any other cryptosystem and has faster computations than half of the other public key systems at the same security levels [8,20–25], ECC is suitable to be used for higher security authentication. In 2009, Wu et al. [24] proposed a SIP authentication scheme based on ECC and proved that the scheme is secure. Yoon et al.'s [25] SIP authentication scheme is also based on ECC and showed that both schemes [8,24] are prone to offline dictionary attacks, Denning–Sacco attacks, and stolen-verifier attacks. In addition, Yoon et al.'s scheme suffers from off-line password guessing attacks [26]. Recently, smart cards have been widely adopted in remote authentication schemes [27–30]. Its features contain the portability, efficiency and the cryptographic capacity, and incur the lower cost. In 2000, Hwang and Li [27] proposed a smart card based remote user authentication and were required to keep in a system without a password table. Wang et al.'s scheme [29] provided two-variant hashing operations on remote user authentication scheme using smart card and showed that Yoon et al.'s scheme [28] is still vulnerable to the guessing attack, forgery attack and denial of service (DoS) attack. Chen et al. [30] propose an enhancement of Wang et al.'s scheme suffering from impersonation and parallel session attacks. Unfortunately, Chen et al.'s improved scheme is still insecure. To solve these problems, we propose a more secure SIP authentication scheme using ECC and smart cards to reduce computation load and avoid the diverse attacks.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related protocols. In Section 3, ECC is briefly reviewed, and a secure user authentication protocol for SIP is presented. The security and performance analyses are in Section 4. Finally, the conclusion is given in Section 5.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have analyzed Diffie–Hellman's concept authentication protocols for SIP. Since SIP needs more efficient methods to perform mutual authentication in an insecure network environment, for applications such as VoIP, we propose a more efficient secret authentication mechanism with ECC. The proposed protocol is more efficient than DH-based authentication and performs secured mutual authentication. To sum up, our proposed protocol inherits the merits of ECC-based mechanism, and enhances the SIP authentication with higher security than HTTP and hash-based protocols. The security of the proposed protocol in the SIP authentication scheme is strengthened.
