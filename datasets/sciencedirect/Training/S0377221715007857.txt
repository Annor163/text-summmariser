@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper studies the implications of upstream and/or downstream horizontal mergers on suppliers, retailers and consumers, in a bilateral oligopolistic system. We especially focus on market power and operational synergy benefits that such mergers engender. Starting with a benchmark pre-merger scenario in which firms compete on prices at each level, we find that the above two consequences individually almost have opposite effects on the merging and non-merging firms’ optimal decisions/profits after a merger. Furthermore, even though the effects of upstream and downstream mergers are different, the vertical supply chain partners will always try to reduce their losses if the market power effect dominates, but will take actions that improve their profits if the synergy effect is stronger. The above results are robust enough to hold even when taking into account intra-brand competition among retailers.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Mergers and acquisitions continue to show remarkable resilience in both deal values and volumes even after the financial crisis of 2008. Many of the largest transactions in this context occur between companies in the same industry (i.e., horizontal mergers). Examples include those between Kraft and Heinz (49 billion dollars) in the food industry, Staples and Office Depot (6 billion dollars) in the retail sector dealing with office supplies, Comcast Corp and Time Warner Cable Inc (70 billion dollars) in the cable-TV and high-speed broadband sector, Actavis and Allergan (66 billion dollars) in the pharmaceutical industry, and Halliburton and Baker Hughes (35 billion dollars) in the energy industry (Burrows, 2014). Note that some of the above mergers occur in the consumer-facing downstream part of the supply chain (e.g., Staples and Office Depot) and others take place in more upstream levels (e.g., Kraft and Heinz or Actavis and Allergan).While there might be a number of motivations behind mergers, the two most important ones are the expected post-merger market power and/or operational synergy benefits (Gale Encyclopedia of E-Commerce, 2002). From the perspective of merging firms, managers usually expect improvements in market share and productive efficiency, irrespective of the level at which the mergers happen (Fee & Thomas, 2004). For example, both Staples+Office Depot and Kraft+Heinz mergers touted the expected cost reduction through supply chain synergies (Martyn, 2015), while the merger between Greencore Group and Northern Foods improved their market power vis-a-vis downstream retailers (Flynn, 2010). Interestingly, non-merging firms – either competitors or partners – in the supply chain are also affected by a merger. Their strategic responses are then crucial to the success/failure of a merger. For example, after purchasing the consumer online service of CompuServe Corp., America Online Inc (AOL) boosted its subscriber base to over 10 million, which allowed it to lower prices to better compete with its upstart competitors (Gale Encyclopedia of E-Commerce, 2002), and there are speculations about how competing manufacturers (e.g., Kellog or Pepsico) and downstream retailers (e.g., Wal-Mart) would respond to Kraft+Heinz merger (DiChristopher, 2015). However, it is worthwhile to point out that, horizontal mergers do not always improve efficiency. For example, Quaker Oats (the producer of Gatorade) failed to realize post-merger synergy after acquiring Snapple in 1994. The merger actually resulted in a loss of 1.4 billion dollars in 27 months. Sears Holding suffered from a revenue loss of more than 10 percent in the four years after its merger with Kmart, while during the same time period, Wal-Mart’s sales rose almost 31 percent and Target’s more than 24 percent (Clifford, 2010).Motivated by the above examples, we aim to address the following questions in this paper:•How do non-merging chain partners and competitors respond to a horizontal merger?What are the effects of an upstream versus a downstream horizontal merger on all relevant firms’ (merging and non-merging) decisions and profits?Under what conditions, if any, does a merger have an adverse effect on supply chain partners and final consumers?To address the above issues, we use a bilateral oligopoly supply chain framework. In our model, it is not only the merging firms that will adjust their decisions after a horizontal merger, upstream or downstream non-merging supply chain partners/competitors will also respond strategically to the change in market structure. Therefore, the overall profitability impact of mergers on the firms or consumers is not straightforward. In alignment with our previous discussion, we study the two primary effects created by a horizontal merger: increased market power and operational synergy.As regards market power, in the context of supply chains, there are two kinds of such power that can accrue from mergers – buying power and selling power. Although researchers have extensively examined the effect of upstream horizontal mergers on selling power vis-à-vis customers, conflicting conclusions have been drawn (Bhattacharyya & Nain, 2011). Regarding the effect of downstream horizontal mergers on buying power, Fee and Thomas (2004) and Shahrur (2005) find empirical evidence that such mergers exert price pressure on upstream suppliers and adversely affect their performance. We complement these studies by showing that increased selling and/or buying power due to mergers (due to upstream and downstream merger, respectively) adversely affects the performance of dependent supply chain partner, but positively affects the firms in non-merging competing supply chain.Concerning operational synergy, merging firms could benefit from it and achieve cost efficiency in multiple ways, such as by reducing production, transaction or fixed costs through economies of scale or scope, learning from their partners’ management expertise, improving production techniques or increasing managerial efficiency (see Trautwein 1990, Farrell & Shapiro 1990, Kim & Singal 1993). In a bilateral supply chain system, we find that while the merging firms and their supply chain partners benefit from synergies and become more profitable after an upstream and/or a downstream merger, the firms in non-merging competing supply chains actually suffer a loss in profitability following the merger.The market power and operational synergy effects of mergers are not only (almost diametrically) opposite for the merging and non-merging supply chains, they are also so from the perspective of the consumers and social welfare. Specifically, when mergers provide market power they are harmful for both, but are desirable when mergers provide synergy benefits. Note that the seminal paper by Deneckere and Davidson (1985) state that in price-setting games, a merger allows merging firms to absorb a negative externality and elicits a spiral of responses from non-merging rival firms, and both these forces are beneficial to the merging firms. By taking into account the reactions of partners in the supply chain as well as the non-merging competitors, we are able to demonstrate that the effects are more nuanced and differs significantly depending on the particular benefit provided by a merger. The above behavior makes the overall effects of a merger somewhat ambiguous; it depends on which of the two effects dominate11Several empirical studies indeed supoort this. For example, Kim and Singal (1993) find empirical evidence from airline industry that mergers may lead to more efficient operations, but on the whole, increased market power dominates efficiency gains, making the consumers worse off.. Interestingly, we can show that non-merging firms always prefer an upstream merger, while consumers and the society prefer a downstream one.Although our above results are based on bilateral supply chains where the suppliers and buyers have exclusive vertical relations, we also explore the robustness of our results by relaxing this assumption in an extended model that incorporates intra-brand competition (i.e., a downstream firm can procure from multiple upstream ones). Although in this case the competition among downstream firms becomes more intense and results in lower prices for consumers, we find that the effects of post-merger market power and synergies are consistent with those in our base model, suggesting that our results are relatively robust.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper explores the effects of an upstream and a downstream horizontal merger on merging firms, non-merging competitors, vertical supply chain partners, final consumers and society as a whole, in a bilateral supply chain environment. We explore the theoretical underpinnings of merger-induced market power and operational synergies. Traditional economic theory suggests that a merger raises prices if it does not generate synergies, and considerable economies of scale are required for a merger to lower prices. Taking into consideration that upstream or downstream firms will react to a merger strategically, we show that the two forces have markedly different effects on every firm’s post-merger strategy.The contribution of our paper to the literature is threefold. First, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of a horizontal merger from an individual firm’s perspective, including the merging firms, a non-merging competitor, a merging firm’s upstream or downstream supply chain partner and a non-merging competitor’s supply chain partner. We show that for both an upstream and a downstream horizontal merger, the effects of market power benefit all firms in the merging industry. In the merging firms’ upstream or downstream industry, mergers reduce the profit for directly related supply chain partners but increase the profit for unrelated suppliers or retailers. This result suggests that knowing that the non-merging firms will benefit from reduced competition and higher profits, their supply chain partners will adjust their strategies accordingly to take advantage of the non-merging rival’s increased market demand. Then, we show that if a merger only generates synergy without greater market power, then both upstream and downstream related supply chain partners benefit from the merger, while non-merging firms and their supply chain partners all suffer a loss in market demand and profit. As a result, vertical partners adjust their pricing strategies to reduce their losses. These results imply that if a firm in the merging industry benefits from the merger, then its supply chain partner will try to take advantage of the benefits, and this reaction is harmful to the firm; conversely, if a firm in the merging industry suffers from the merger, then its supply chain partner will try to help reduce the loss for the whole supply chain. When both market power and synergy effects exist, firms will adjust their strategy depending on which effect is stronger.Second, we provide policy implications for antitrust authorities. Our results suggest that with the market power effect, an upstream merger is more detrimental to consumers and society as a whole than a downstream merger, while given the same degree of synergy, both an upstream and a downstream merger can be equally beneficial for consumers and society. When there is intra-brand competition among retailers with mixed supply chain, we find that upstream merger-induced market power lessens the negative effect on retailers and yields less detrimental effects on consumers and society, while the effect of post-merger synergy in a downstream merger is more beneficial. Therefore, antitrust authorities should take into account the effects of a horizontal merger, not only on the merging industry, but also on the upstream and downstream market before deciding whether to challenge a merger.Finally, this paper contributes to the operations management literature by analyzing the effects of horizontal mergers in vertically related industries. We provide equilibrium solutions and qualitative results for mergers in a bilateral supply chain system, and also compare the different effects of an upstream and a downstream merger from a welfare perspective. To derive the closed-form expression of post-merger outcomes, we assume deterministic demand and costs. Nonetheless, we conjecture that our results would remain valid if demand uncertainty or cost uncertainty is relatively small, because they are generally consistent with those in Banal-Estañol and Ottaviani (2006) and Zhou (2008). Clearly, there are opportunities to extend our analysis by considering a more general demand or cost functions. Some other future research directions could include heterogeneous production costs, the opportunity for entry and the effects of operational levers such as inventory, lot-size and capacity. Moreover, it would be interesting to analyze the effect of operational synergy in a vertical merger case.Proof ofProposition 1. Given the n retailers’ problems (3), we first solve the first order conditions (FOC)∂πRi(p)∂pi=0,fori=1,…,n,and findpi(w)=2+β−3β2+cr(2+5β+3β2)+wi(2+3β+β2)+(β+β2)∑j≠iwj2(2+3β).Then substitutepi(w)into di, and write suppliers profit as a function ofw,πSi(w)=(wi−cs)di(pi(w)).Solving the FOC for the suppliers’ problem gives the optimal wholesale pricewi*.wi*=2(1−cr+cs)+β(1−cr+3cs)−β2(3−3cr+cs)4(1+β−β2).Taking the derivative ofwi*with respect to β, we show that for any β ∈ (0, 1),∂wi*∂β=−(1−cr−cs)(1+2β+2β2)4(1+β−β2)2<0.Therefore, the optimal wholesale price is decreasing in β. Substituting the optimal wholesale price into the retail price and demand functions respectively, we can derive the optimal retail price and demand for each product. The profit for each supplier and retailer, consumer surplus, and social welfare can be easily obtained as well. Taking the derivative with respect to β yields:∂pi*∂β=−(1−cr−cs)(3+8β+4β2−2β3+β4)8(1+β−β2)2∂di*∂β=−(1−cr−cs)(1−10β2−14β3−3β4)8(1+2β)2(1+β−β2)2∂πSi*∂β=−(1−cr−cs)2(2+3β−β2)(1+3β+2β2+β3+3β4+β5+β6)32(1+2β)2(1+β−β2)3∂πRi*∂β=−(1−cr−cs)2(4+14β+11β2+7β3+38β4+41β5+5β6)32(1+2β)2(1+β−β2)3∂CS*∂β=3(1+β)(1−cr−cs)2(2+3β−β2)(1+7β+15β2+10β3+β5)64(1+2β)2(1+β−β2)3∂SW*∂β=−3(1−cr−cs)2(10+27β−21β2−84β3+17β4+95β5+19β6+2β7−β8)64(1+2β)2(1+β−β2)3For any feasible β, crand cs, it is easy to verify that∂pi*∂β<0,∂πSi*∂β<0,∂πRi*∂β<0,∂CS*∂β>0,and∂SW*∂β<0. As for∂di*∂β,sincelimβ→0∂di*∂β<0,andlimβ→1∂di*∂β>0,the equilibrium demanddi*is decreasing first then increasing in β.
