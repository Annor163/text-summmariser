@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study investigated the biomechanical response of porous cages and lumbar spine segments immediately after surgery and after bone fusion, in addition to the long-term effects of various posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) techniques, by using the finite element method. Lumbar L3-L4 models based on three PLIF techniques (a single cage at the center of the intervertebral space, a single cage half-anterior to the intervertebral space, and two cages bilateral to the intervertebral space) with and without bone ingrowth were used to determine the biomechanical response of porous cages and lumbar segments instrumented with porous titanium cages (cage porosity=50%, pore diameter=1mm). The results indicated that bone fusion enhanced the stability of the lumbar segments with porous cages without any posterior instrumentation and reduced the peak von Mises stress in the cortical bones and porous cages. Two cages placed bilateral to the intervertebral space achieved the highest structural stability in the lumbar segment and lowest von Mises stress in the cages under both bone fusion conditions. Under identical loading (2-Nm), the range of motion in the single cage at the center of the intervertebral space with bone fusion decreased by 11% (from 1.18° to 1.05°) during flexion and by 66.5% (from 4.46° to 1.5°) during extension in the single cage half-anterior to the intervertebral space with bone fusion compared with no-fusion models. Thus, two porous titanium cages with 50% porosity can achieve high stability of a lumbar segment with PLIF. If only one cage is available, placing the cage half-anterior to the intervertebral space is recommended for managing degenerated lumbar segments.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Among 357,000 individuals who underwent lumbar spinal surgery in the United States, 122,000 were performed to manage degenerative disk disease [1]. Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), a common surgical treatment strategy for managing degenerated disk disease from the posterior aspect of the lumbar spine, is used for inserting bone grafts, spacers, or interbody cages into a spinal segment to facilitate a biomechanical response leading to bone growth between two vertebral bodies and to enhance spinal stability [2–4]. Spinal interbody cages can restore the disk height and neuroforaminal space immediately after surgery and relieve pain and neuropathy symptoms. Conventional titanium cages combined with bone graft or bone morphogenetic protein can also achieve an adequate fusion rate; however, postoperative complications including stress shielding, migration, subsidence, mechanical failure of the cage, and osteoporosis can persist [5–11]. Cages composed of polyetheretherketone (PEEK), which has an elastic modulus closer to bone than to titanium, can reduce the stress-shielding effect and promote bone fusion [12,13]. Despite several reports indicating favorable outcomes from using PEEK cages to manage degenerative disease of the intervertebral disks [14–16], micromotion remains a problem because of poor osteointegration of the connective fibrous tissue between the PEEK cages and surrounding bones; this is unfavorable for achieving solid fusion and long-term stability [13,17,18].Porous cages have also been used for managing degenerative disk disease and restoring disk height, in addition to use in various artificial implants [19–25]. The major advantage of using porous materials is that they facilitate bone tissue ingrowth into the connected holes of the cage, thereby enhancing long-term stability [19,23]. Porous cages composed of titanium alloy (titanium-6 aluminum-4 vanadium [Ti-6Al-4V]) fabricated using additive manufacturing methods can achieve more favorable osteoblast adhesion and differentiation than PEEK cages [18,26–28]. Moreover, they are structurally similar to the connected and open porous framework of cancellous bone. Porous cages function as scaffolds and maintain space within the bone. Bone cells then migrate into the space and form new bone tissue; therefore, no additional bone graft is required [29]. Additive manufacturing methods including additive laser selective melting (ALSM) and electron beam melting can be adopted to produce porous cages composed of Ti–6Al–4V with various porosities and pore sizes [30,31]. The crucial advantage of additive manufacturing methods is that they enable open pore connectivity. Porous titanium cages fabricated through ALSM have achieved high osteointegration and stability in sheep spines [32]. However, no mechanical study of porous cages has been conducted on the human spine, particularly after bone ingrowth into the pores of the cages. Moreover, the geometry and loading mode of sheep spines differ from those of human spines. Although a cadaveric study reported immediate stability of the cages, the long-term effects were not demonstrated. Moreover, the internal mechanical conditions, including the stress and strain of the bone and cages, are difficult to measure and analyze through cadaveric tests because no available sensor is sufficiently small and flexible to fit inside the inner surface of the pores. By contrast, the long-term mechanical effect of filling the pores with bone tissue can be calculated using a computer-aided engineering technique named the finite element (FE) method. The FE method is a numerical tool for obtaining biomechanical responses among all structures, including those immediately after surgery and those after the pores had been filled with bone tissue. The numerical FE method involves solving partial differential equations of complex problems. The strength of the FE method is that it enables calculating the internal stress on both the bone and the implants and that of the coupling effect of the implanted device, complex-shaped bones, and inhomogeneous materials under loading [33–38]. Therefore, this study used computer simulations to investigate the immediate and long-term biomechanical responses of porous cages and lumbar segments instrumented with these cages through PLIF. The range of motion (ROM) of the lumbar segment with a porous cage and von Mises stress in the cages and bone were measured. Furthermore, various PILF surgical techniques using single- or double-porous lumbar cages with and without bone ingrowth (bone fusion) were compared.An FE model of the L3-L4 segment was developed to determine the immediate postsurgery and long-term effectiveness of bone ingrowth into the cage pores in degenerated lumbar segments, for which various PLIF surgical techniques were implemented to implant porous titanium interbody cages. The model was instrumented with one or two cages, and the volume of the pores was filled with bone tissue to simulate the long-term effect of bone ingrowth [39]. In addition, three more surgical techniques were involved: a single cage located at the center of the intervertebral space, a single cage located half-anterior to the intervertebral space, and two cages located bilateral to the intervertebral space.A three-dimensional FE model of the L3-L4 lumbar segments of a human spine was developed using computed tomography images of a healthy 27-year-old man with no spinal disease. His body weight and height were 178cm and 78kg, respectively. The images were captured in 1-mm increments in a neutral position and processed using Avizo Version 6 software (VSG, Bordeaux, France) to determine the bone contours. The contours of the cortical and cancellous bone were dissociated according to a threshold of gray values in each image. The three-dimensional volume was calculated on the basis of the dissociated contour lines and edited to smooth the complex bony surfaces and reduce the number of elements in the subsequent mesh process. Retrieval of the facet joints was difficult because only a few of their images were obtained; therefore, a 0.5-mm gap was created between the facet joint surfaces according to the literature [40]. The intervertebral disk was created by encircling the volume boundary between the endplates of adjacent segments, including the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosis [41].Porous cages were inserted into the intervertebral space to support the vertebral body and simulate the PLIF treatment of a lumbar spine with a degenerated disk. The porous cages used in this study were created using Solidworks 2012 software (Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks Corp., Waltham, MA, USA). The cage porosity was set at 50% according to the literature [39,42]. The cages were 22×9.9×10.5mm (Fig. 1) with interconnected 1-mm pores (all pores in the computer-aided design (CAD) model were uniform in size),whose diameter facilitated using additive manufacturing equipment (EOSINT M 280; EOS GmbH, Krailling/Munich, Germany) to fabricate samples for material property testing.Porosity can be expressed using the following equation:P=[(V0−V)/V0]×100%where P denotes the porosity, V0 the volume of the buck, and V the cellular volume. Higher values of P indicate more space for bone tissue growth but lower strength.First, the disk was removed, but the facet joint was retained. Next, the cages were placed at the midline between the upper (L3) and lower (L4) vertebral bodies. The height of the cage (10.5mm) was defined on the basis of the original disk height to enable the cage to support the vertebral body after its insertion. Three PLIF surgical techniques and one or two cages were used; furthermore, conforming to the findings of a previous study [26], various horizontal cage locations in the intervertebral space L4 were used in the single-cage condition (Fig. 2a–c). The long-term effectiveness of the bone fusion was modeled by filling the pores of the cage with bone tissue (Fig. 1b). In total, six models were employed in this study: a single cage located at the center of the intervertebral space, placed immediately after surgery, with (SCF) and without (SC) bone fusion; a single cage located half-anterior to the intervertebral space, placed immediately after surgery, with (SAF) and without (SA) bone fusion; and two cages located bilateral (left and right) to the intervertebral space, placed immediately after surgery, with (TCF) and without (TC) bone fusion. Thus, three surgical techniques and their effectiveness at two time points were evaluated.The solid model was imported into ANSYS Version 14 software (Swanson Analysis, Houston, PA, USA) for computation. The bones and disks were meshed with quadratic elements (element type: SOLID187). The spring elements adopted for modeling the spinal ligaments were set to tension alone. The ligaments were defined by connecting the corresponding nodes on the bones. Seven spinal ligaments were created in the model: an anterior longitudinal ligament, a posterior longitudinal ligament, intertransverse ligaments, capsular ligaments of the facet joints, a ligamentum flavum, an interspinous ligament, and a supraspinous ligament.The contact behaviors between the cages and cortical bones were set as frictional, with a frictional coefficient of 0.3 [43], in the model immediately after the surgery (no fusion), whereas the contact behaviors between the cages and cortical bones under the bone-fusion conditions were changed to bounding. The contact behaviors between the facet joints were defined as frictionless surface-to-surface contacts, and only normal forces could be conducted through them. The contact behaviors between the ligaments and bones were neglected.The bone volume growth into the pores of the porous cages and the adjacent material of the cage were merged using the command “form new part” in ANSYS Workbench; the nodes consisted of the interface between the bone and cage.All material properties were defined as linear elastic and homogeneous, the bone structure and disk were defined as isotropic, and the ligaments were set as tension only (Table 1), according to the literature [44–46]. The elastic modulus of the solid titanium in the porous cages was estimated from experimental test data (Fig. 3). The test samples were fabricated using the EOSINT M 280 operated with default settings. Variations in the manufacturing process were not employed in this study because they were previously investigated [30,31,47,48]. The dimensions of the test samples (height=10mm, gauge length=3mm, outer diameter=3mm) were confirmed using a caliper. The loading rate during the test was set to 1mm/min.Preliminary simulations were performed on the intact L3-L4 model for validation. Two types of loading—1-mm compression and 10-Nm moment of flexion on the sagittal plane—were applied on the superior surface of the model. The peak intradisk pressure, ROM in flexion, and structural stiffness were plotted and validated by comparing with previous results [49–56]. The results of previous finite element and experimental studies were compared with those of the present study to confirm the credibility of the model.In this study, the effectiveness was evaluated at two time points (immediately after surgery and after bone fusion). Three loading conditions, with a 400-N compressive preload, were used for evaluating the fusion effect and various surgical techniques: 2-N m loading immediately after surgery, 2-Nm loading after bone fusion, and 10-Nm loading after bone fusion. Four types of moments were applied at both time points: extension, flexion, side bending, and axial rotation (Fig. 2d–g). The loadings applied to the superior and inferior surfaces of the L3 and L4, respectively, were fixed to prevent planar displacement [57–60].Theoretically, von Mises stress is often used to determine whether a material will yield when undergoing a complex loading condition. In biomechanical studies, von Mises stress can be employed as an index for evaluating the impact of loading on the tissue. Therefore, the higher the von Mises stress value, the higher the risk that failure will occur.
