@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This article discusses the steady state analysis of theM/G/2queuing system with two heterogeneous servers under new queue disciplines when the classical First Come First Served ‘(FCFS)’ queue discipline is to be violated. Customers are served either by server-I according to an exponential service time distribution with mean rate μ or by server-II with a general service time distributionB(t). Sequel to some objections raised in the literature on the use of the classical FCFS queue discipline in heterogeneous service systems, two alternative queue disciplines (Serial and Parallel) are considered in this work with the objective that if the FCFS is violated then the violation is a minimum in the long run. Using the embedded method under the serial queue discipline and the supplementary variable technique under the parallel queue discipline, we present an exact analysis of the steady state number of customers in the system and most importantly, the actual waiting time expectation of customers in the system. Our work shows that one can obtain all stationary probabilities and other vital measures for this queue under certain simple but realistic assumptions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
We consider theM/G/2queuing system with an exponential server (server-I) and a general server (server-II). Customers arrive according to a Poisson process at a rate λ for service with much expectation of spending the least waiting time in the system. Server-I has a faster service rate compared with server-II. This information is not new to prospective customers. Thus, server-I is always busy when there is at least a customer in the system. The service times of customers1Which are independent of inter-arrival times.1are assumed to be a sequence of mutually independent and identically distributed random variables with finite moments. In addition, services are without preemption. For customers serviced by server-I, the service timeT1follows the exponential distribution with rate μ i.e.F1(t)=P(T1<t)=1-e-μtwith probability density function (PDF)f1(t)=dF1(t)dtand Laplace-Stiltjes Transform (LST)f1∗(s)=∫0∞e-stdF1(t)dt. Similarly, for customers serviced by server-II, their service time distributionB(t)=P[T2<t]is general with PDFb(t), a meanβ=E[T2]and a LSTb∗(s)given byb∗(s)=∫0∞e-stdB(t). We supposed thatμ2=1β,ρ=λμand the servers occupation rate (servers utilization)ρ1=λμ+μ2<1, so that all steady state results are tractable, see Boxma, Deng, and Zwart (2002).Generally, a number of literature sources on queuing systems raises some objections to the use of the classical First Come First Served (FCFS) queuing discipline in systems with heterogeneous structures (Krishnamoorthy, 1962; Alexander, Marcus, & Cristobal, 20142Implied in this work also.2). This stand can be justified. For instance, if clerks in a reservation counter provide service with varying speeds then customers might prefer to choose the fastest clerk for service. On the other hand, if one chooses the slowest clerk randomly then customers that entered the system after him may clear out earlier by obtaining service from a clerk with a faster working rate. Apparently in this case,the FCFS queue disciplineis violated due to heterogeneity in service speeds of the clerks. This and similar real life scenarios make the FCFS queue discipline unrealistic in queuing systems with embedded heterogeneity because of the high probability of violation therein. Hence, there is the need for designing alternative queue disciplines that can reduce the impact of the violation so that the resulting waiting times of customers are almost identical with that of the FCFS. Similarly in a business center, one may come across a scenario where both the salesman and the boss3Or even a salesman and a supervisor or a senior colleague.3(owner) are providing services together. If there is only one customer then he is serviced by the salesman provided that no any other one arrives during his service period. On the other hand, if at least an arrival occurs then the boss joins the salesman either serially (working jointly with the salesman to serve the initial customer) or in parallel (attending a different customer). As a schedule, if there are up to two customers in the center then the boss will join the salesman in service4Jointly but independently (one customer at a time) in the first model but independently paralleled in the second model.4so that customers do not get bored by excessive waiting and choose to renege or balk thereby making the business loose market. We refer to the first service approach as serial service as implied in the serial queue discipline below and the later as parallel service as in parallel queue discipline also below. Note that the class of serial queuing systems is not extensively studied in the literature in contrast to the parallel case systems (see Emrah, Ceyda, & Irem, 2013) even though, significant areas of application are found in reality. Our motivation stemmed from these numerous physical applications of the proposed models (both serial and parallel) in shops, malls, supermarkets, offices, banks and several other business outfits where heterogeneity of servers is embedded. An in-depth analysis therefore is an excellent tool for decision making relative to congestion management, better service provision, etc. For instance, a business mogul owning two shops each with two staff (servers) of varying work speed may wish to understand which of the two models above5Suppose that one of his shops adopts theM/(M+G)/2model under the serial queue discipline while the other shop adopts the parallel service order of theM/M,G/2with service schedule following a parallel queue discipline5minimizes waiting times better.6This is one of the many physical scenarios involving the applications of the two models under the designed serial and parallel queue disciplines.6Similarly, he may wish to understand whether an equilibrium point exists under which one model is to be preferred to the other or even when the two models are identical. These kind of questions are vital for performance evaluation and better management practice since heterogeneity is a natural embedding in reality and is the necessitating factor leading to server discrimination. For instance between a well experienced shop seller and an apprentice, a senior doctor and a junior doctor, a professor and a bachelor, etc. Basically, customers hate to wait for a longer time arising from the in-effectiveness of a slow server and in several instances may prefer to wait for the remaining service time of a customer being served by a fast server even when the slow server is idle. Over the years, a lot have been written on homogeneous service systems for instance, Hoksad (1978), Hoksad (1979), Senthamaraikannan and Sivasamy (1997), Tijms, Vaan Hoorn, and Federgruen (1981), etc. The reader is referred to these and many others to refresh. Similarly research works on heterogeneous service systems has grown tremendously in the last two decades; Kim, Ahn, and Righter (2011), Kumar, Madheswari, and Venkatakrishnan (2007), Krishnamoorthy (1962), Shenkar and Weinrib (1989), Singh (1968), etc. In the models described in these works, the heterogeneity structure is saddled on servers following relatively the same distributions. A model of the general service type is studied by Boxma et al. (2002) unfortunately, due to complex structuring, formations and assumptions, it could not estimate certain areas in the general case. Part of this complexity may be saddled on the assumption of the FCFS queue discipline adopted in such a heterogeneous structure.7For instance, the unknown functionQ1(x).7In this article, we have introduced two queue disciplines (serial and parallel) whose effects on the two models described below can all be computed numerically. Most importantly, the serial queue discipline is relatively close to that of Boxma et al. (2002) and the parallel queue discipline is that of Krishnamoorthy (1962). Thus, our work in this sense is a base for comparing the effects of these queue disciplines on the models for better use and adoption in real life business applications. The rest of the article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe the model together with the preliminary assumptions employed. Section 3 deals with the steady state analysis of theM/(M+G)/2queue with two heterogeneous servers operating under the serial queue discipline. Here, the Probability Generating Function (PGF) of the number of customers in the system, the LST of the waiting time distribution and their mean values have been obtained. Similarly, a numerical illustration is provided to support the results on mean waiting times. Section 4 provides an analysis via the supplementary variable technique and LST methods on theM/M,G/2queue where a necessary condition under which the steady state behavior of theM/(M+G)/2and that of theM/M,G/2are identical. In particular; when the mean queue length and the mean waiting time values are almost equal. Section 5 highlights the various special features of the proposed methodology and its future scope.A representation of theM/G/2queuing system under the serial queue discipline with servers is modeled as anM/(M+G)/2queue with a Poisson arrival process and a general service time process on the two servers in the system.8A realistic scenario for the serial model occurs for instance in a shop with two servers when a customer is being serviced by the first server. Upon arrival of another customer the second server joins the first server to service the first customer to hasten his service process there by reducing the waiting time of the second and subsequent customers. The other model i.e. the(M/M,G/2)comes into picture if the second server decides to serve the second customer independently.8Similarly, anM/G/2queuing system under the parallel queue discipline is modeled as theM/M,G/2queue with parallel servers.Two alternative queue disciplines (serial and parallel) are proposed in this work. We suppose that an arbitrary shop whose queuing features are that of theM/M/1type (here server-I) is experiencing an increase in demand resulting from the increasing needs of customers. As a remedy, it can be decided that an additional general server (server-II) be put in place to operate jointly9In a manner similar to that of a device functioning with two components.9with the existing server in series or be placed in parallel to the initial server. In each case, one can infer that, some degree of service improvements will be experienced generally.Lemma 2.1SupposeT1∼exp(μ)andT2∼B(t)denote the service times of customers in theM/(M+G)/2queuing system with the number of customersN(t)⩾2. LetT=min(T1,T2)andD(t)=P[T>t]with PDFfmin(t). Then the departure rater(t)of the serialized servers is given by(2.1)r(t)=fmin(t)D(t)=μ+B′(t)1-B(t)Given thatT1∼exp(μ)andT2∼B(t), letD1(t)=1-F1(t)andD2(t)=1-B(t)be the tail service time distributions forT1andT2respectively. Given thatD(t)=P[min(T1,T2)>t]=P[T>t]whereT1andT2are independent random variables then(2.2)D(t)=P[min(T1,T2)>t]=P[T1>t]+P[T2>t]=Σi=12Di(t)Consequently, the departure rater(t)of the complementary distribution functionD(t)with PDFfmin(t)is(2.3)r(t)=fmin(t)D(t)=f1(t)1-F1(t)+B′(t)1-B(t)=μ+B′(t)1-B(t)□The Serial Queue Discipline:Suppose that the decision reached above favors the installation of an additional general server (server-II) jointly in series with the exponential server (server-I) such that:1.If a customer arrives during the idle state of the system, his service is immediately initiated by server-I (since server-I is faster than server-II). This customer receives service at exponential rate μ if no other customer arrives during his ongoing service period; otherwise if at least one more customer arrives, then the initial customer is served jointly by both servers but independently according to the service time distributionFmin(t)defined in item 2(i) below.As long as the system sizeN(t)⩾2at any time t, then server-II joins server-I to serve a customer in service jointly in series, otherwise server-I is the only available server in the system.To conceptualize the above type of server interaction process between the two servers during an operational period of theM/(M+G)/2model proposed in this work, suppose that there exist a shop selling distinct products with two human servers and system sizeN(t)⩾2at anytime t, such that:i. The queuing system is busy if and only if at least one of the two servers is busy with service time distributionFmin(t)whereFmin(t)=P(T<t);T=min(T1,T2)with PDFfmin(t)and LSTfmin∗(s)given by the integralfmin∗(s)=∫0∞e-stdFmin(t)=f1∗(s)+b∗(s+μ)-f1∗(s)b∗(s+μ).ii.If the system has only one customer then that customer is served by server-I entirely at a constant rate μ without being interrupted until his service is completed.The Parallel Queue Discipline:For theM/M,G/2model proposed here, we adopt the parallel queue discipline of Krishnamoorthy (1962) subject to the condition10We provide an analysis form=1customer who might prefer to wait for server-I even when server-II is idle.10that the mean service rates of server-I and server-II are respectively μ andμ2.A customer arrives to find:1.Both servers free; he occupies server-I (assuming that server-I gives faster service on average).Server-I is engaged; he waits for service from server-I whether or not server-II is free. But if the number of customers waiting for service from server-I becomes m (a positive integer), he goes to server-II for service if that server is free; otherwise he waits as the(m+1)th customer in the queue. Note that the first m customers in the queue will be getting service from server-I and the(m+1)th customer in the queue will go to server-II if that server becomes free prior to the finishing of service of the customer in server-I. Otherwise he will move up as the mth customer in the queue. Hence may decide to take service from server-I.Both servers are engaged and a queue of length ’n greater than or equal to m is formed. He joins the queue as the(n+1)th customer. All customers after the mth customer in the queue take a decision only when they reach the(m+1)th position in the queue. The decision is taken according to the rule mentioned in 2 of server-I engaged above.The positive integer m is to be chosen such that it is one less than the greatest integer in the ratioμμ2. It is clear that for this choice of m the following happens: When there are m customers waiting for service from server-I, an incoming customer finds it profitable to go to server-II if that server is free since(m+2)μ-1<μ2-1. Similarly, when there are only(m-1)customers waiting for service from server-I, an incoming customer will find it profitable to join the queue for service from server-I, even if server-II is free since(m+1)μ-1<μ2-1. In caseμμ2-1is an integer thenm=μμ2-1-1so that joining the queue for service from server-I is not any more or any less profitable than going to server-II if the server is free. But there is no harm in assuming that even in this case the customer joins the queue for service from server-I when there are only(m-1)customers waiting for service. Thus, this queue discipline achieves the objective that the least amount of waiting time is spent in the system according to the conditions present upon its arrival (for this specific choice of m) and also, it reduces the violation of first-in first-out principle. Generally, results on methodologies for choosing m under any specific queue discipline is limited. However, the work of Efrosinin and Sztrik (2011) is worth mentioning here. Efrosinin and Sztrik (2011) have shown that, if m is chosen such thatm=(μ-λ+(μ-λ)2+4μ2λ)(2μ2), then an optimal value for the mean number of customers in the system under the parallel queue discipline will be attained.11In a two-server heterogeneous retrial queue with threshold policy.11Consider ‘the embedded time points’ generated at departure instants of customers just after a service is completed by either server-I or server-II. By analogy, a Markov chain can be discovered at these points. Let this chain represent the state of the systemNj=N(tj)left behind by thejth customer upon departure epochtj. Then the discrete time process{Nj}constitutes a Markov chain on the discrete state spaceS={0,1,2,…∞}. Letqjbe the stationary probability that j customers are left behind by a departing customer with a z-transformV(z)=∑j=0∞qjzjand letpjbe the steady state probability that there are j customers in the system at an arbitrary instant between successive embedded points with z-transformP(z)=∑j=0∞pjzj. Since the number of customers in the system changes at most by±1at a transition (arrival or departure) epoch, we can claim thatP(z)is the generating function of the system states at departure instants of customers.12In view of PASTA.12SupposeRj(t)=P[N(t)=j,j⩾2,t<ζ<t+Δt]such thatpj=∫0∞Rj(t)1-Fmin(t)dtandqj=∫0∞Rj(t)1-Fmin(t)dFmin(t)respectively, then application of the PASTA property of the system yields thatP(z)=V(z). Letαjdenote the probability that j customers arrive at departure instants of customers with PDFfmin(t)and letδjdenote the probability that j customers arrive at arbitrary instants when a service is in progress with PDFf1(t). Since arrivals follow a Poisson process at a steady rate λ, then forj=2,3,…∞, one can haveαj=∫0∞e-λt(λt)jfmin(t)j!dtandδj=∫0∞e-λt(λt)jf1(t)j!dt. Denote byA(z)andA1(z)the z-transforms of the probability distributions{αj}and{δj}respectively such thatA(z)=∑j=0∞αjzj=fmin∗(λ-λz)andA1(z)=∑j=0∞δjzj=f1∗(λ-λz). Now, focusing on the embedded points under equilibrium conditions, let the unit step conditional transition probability of the system going from state ‘i’ of the(k-1)thembedded point to state j of the kth embedded point beqij=P(Nk=j/Nk-1=i)fori,j∈S. Then the transition probabilities will form the unit step transition probability matrix Q=(qij) below:(3.1)Q=δ0δ1δ2δ3....δ0δ1δ2δ3....0α0α1α2α3...00α0α1α2α3..000α0α1α2α3.If we denote byqj=limn→∞qijnthe equilibrium state probabilities at departure instants whereqijnrepresents the n-step probability of moving from state i to j such thatQ=qijwithq=(q0,q1,q2,…)ande=(1,1,1,…)′, then a numerical evaluation ofqcan be done by solving the following matrix equations:(3.2)qQ=q,qe=1Now, multiplying thejth equation ofqQ=qin (3.2) byzjand summing all the left-hand sides and the right-hand sides fromj=0toj=∞, one obtains that(3.3)V(z)=q1z[Amin(z)-A1(z)]+q0[Amin(z)-A1(z)z]Amin(z)-zLetρ=λμ. Sinceq1=ρq0,Amin′(1)=-λfmin′∗(0)=λμ+μ2=ρ1<1,A1′(1)=-λf1′∗(0)=λμ=ρ. Atz=1, we derive from (3.3) that(3.4)q0=1-ρ11+(ρ-ρ1)(1+ρ)And the mean number of customersE(N)present in the system at a random point or at a departure epoch is(3.5)E(N)=ρ+ρ12(1-ρ1)+(ρ-ρ1)[ρ+ρ1(1+ρ)]1+(ρ-ρ1)(1+ρ)Similarly, the mean waiting timeW‾13Inclusive of the service time.13of customers in the system can be obtained using the well-known Little’s formulaλW‾=E(N).For a numerical illustration, suppose that λ varies from5to12as in Table 1below whileμ=8.0,μ2=7.5. The following numerical results corresponding toρ,ρ1,q0,E(N), andW‾are obtained14The range of the arrival rate is varied from low to high so that the results of this work cover all cases of the utilization parameter up to a value sufficiently close to unity.14:From Table 1, it can be seen that both the mean queue lengthE(N)and the mean waiting timeW‾steadily increases with increase in λ. Similarly, the stationaryq0values decrease with increase in λ as expected.We will now discuss the steady state analysis of theM/M,G/2queue under the parallel queuing discipline outlined in section two given thatm=1customer. The analysis is carried out using the past service time of the customer being served by server-II as a supplementary variable.Denote by N the steady state number of customers in the system and by ζ the steady state past service time15The supplementary variable.15of the current customer on server-II. Looking at the system at departure instants, then the bi-variate process{N,ζ}is a Markov process with state spaceS={0,1,2,…}×[0,∞). Suppose that P is a probability measure such that(4.1)R0=P[Bothserversareidle](4.2)R1,0=[Server-Iisbusy;server-IIisidle;N=1](4.3)R0,1(η)=P[Server-Iisidle,Server-IIisbusyN=1;η⩽ζ<η+dη](4.4)R1,1(η)=P[Bothserversarebusy;N=2,η⩽ζ<η+dη](4.5)R1,1,0=P[servers-Iisbusy,N=2,andserver-IIisidle]and that(4.6)R1,1,1(η)=P[Bothserversarebusy,N=3,andη⩽ζ<η+dη]Note: We assign η toRjonly when server-II is busy. Given that two or more customers are present in the system and that their past service time lies in(η,η+dη)then in steady state,Rj(η)→Rjas seen in (4.7)–(4.10) and (4.11) below.Now, ifRj=P[N=j]is the stationary probability that there are j-customers in the system. Then(4.7)R0=P[N=0]=R0,0(4.8)R1=P[N=1]=R1,0+R0,1(4.9)R2=P[N=2]=R1,1,0+R1,1(4.10)R3=P[N=3]=R1,1,1(4.11)Rj=P(N=j)Since ifj⩾2,wehavej=(1,1)or(1,1,0),j=(1,1,1),andj=4,j=5,…then forζ>0, we can write(4.12)Rj(η)=P[N=j,η⩽ζ⩽η+dη]Furthermore, let(4.13)Qj(η)=Rj(η)1-B(η),j⩾2.16Strictly, forj⩾2when server-II is busy only.16such that(4.14)Qj∗(s)=∫0∞e-sηRj(η)1-B(η)dη,Qj∼(η)=βRj∼(η)where(4.14a)Rj∼(η)=∫0∞Qj(η)dB(η)Here, the service time distribution is eitherF1(η)orB(η)throughout since each service period depends on the server providing service with departure ratesr1(η)=f1(η)D1(η)=μorr2(η)=b(η)D2(η)=B′(η)1-B(η).PGF of the Stationary Customer Distribution P(z)In this subsection, we explain a methodology for computing the sequence of probability functions{Rj}representing the steady state number of customers in the system leading to the generating functionP(z)=∑0∞Rjzjbut notP(z)itself.17The equivalent of P(z).17The standard argument discussed above shows that the sequence{Rj}satisfies a set of steady state equations given in Appendix A. Using (4.14) and (4.14a) in that sense, we can rewrite them as given below:(4.15)λR0=μR1,0+1βQ∼0,1(4.16)(λ+μ)R1,0=λR0+μR1,1,0+1βQ∼1,1(4.17)(λ+μ)R1,1,0=λR1,0+1βQ∼1,1,1(4.18)Q0,1′(η)=-λQ0,1(η)+μQ1,1(η)(4.19)Q0,1(0+)=0,j=1(4.20)Q1,1′(η)=-(λ+μ)Q1,1(η)+λQ0,1(η)+μQ1,1,1(η)(4.21)Q1,1(0+)=0,j=2(4.22)Q1,1,1′(η)=-(λ+μ)Q1,1,1(η)+λQ1,1(η)+μQ4(η)(4.23)Q1,1,1(0+)=λR1,1,0+1βQ∼4,j=3Forj⩾4, we have(4.24)Qj(η)=-[λ+μ]Qj(η)+λQj-1(η)+μQj+1(η)(4.25)Qj(0+)=1βQ∼j+1,j⩾4To solve (4.18)–(4.24) and (4.25), apply the Laplace operator on the mentioned differential equations coupled with the appropriate boundary conditions. Then one obtains that(4.26)sQ0,1∗(s)+λQ0,1∗(s)=μQ1,1∗(s)And forj⩾2, we have(4.27)sQ1,1∗(s)+(λ+μ)Q1,1∗(s)=λQ0,1∗(s)+μQ1,1,1∗(s)(4.28)sQ1,1,1∗(s)+(λ+μ)Q1,1,1∗(s)=λQ1,1∗(s)+μQ4∗(s)+λR1,1,0+1βQ∼4(4.29)sQ4∗(s)+(λ+μ)Q4∗(s)=λQ1,1,1∗(s)+μQ5∗(s)+1βQ∼5(4.30)sQj∗(s)+(λ+μ)Qj∗(s)=λQj-1∗(s)+μQj+1∗(s)+1βQ∼j+1j⩾5To solve (4.26)–(4.29) and (4.30), we take advantage of the following lemma.Lemma 4.1Given that the traffic conditionλ<μ+1βholds, then in a busy period(4.31)Qj∗(0)=Q∼j,j=2,3,….,Suppose that a busy period is in progress such that the timeTnbetween two successive departures from server-II is given asTn=tn-tn-1,n=1,2,3,4,…Then for any number of departuren⩾1during this busy period, the service period is a probabilistic replication of the initial periodt1. More so, if the queue length process at any time t during this period isN(t), we are assured thatN(t)would reach steady state starting att=0,N(0)⩾2in the long run. Consequently,N(t)is a regenerative process over t on state spaceS2=2,3,…andTn=tn-tn-1is an underlying renewal process attjeach time a departure occurs on server-II. Now, given thatλ<μ+1βholds, then upon service completion on server-II, the state probability is(4.32)Rj(t)=P[N(t)=j,j=2,3,…]and if the past service time is η at a time t, then the conditional probability that there are j customers in the system is(4.33)Rj(t,η)=P[N(t)=j|t=η,j=2,3,…]Let(4.34)Qj(t,η)=Rj(t,η)1-B(t,η)So that(4.35)Qj(t)(1-B(t))=Rj(t)=P[N(t)=j|t1>t]Then(4.36)∑j=2∞Qj(t)=P[t1>t]=1-B(t)and(4.37)Qj(t)=∫0∞P[N(t)=j|t1>t]=∫0∞P[N(t)=j,t1>t|t1=η]which can be simplified to(4.38)Qj(t)=∫η∞P[N(t)=j|t1=η]dB(η)Here, it is seen that(4.39)Rj(t)=∫0∞P[N(t)=j,t1=η]dB(η)Thus, by conditioning ont1, under steady state conditions, it can be shown that the following renewal equation is satisfied.(4.40)Rj(t)=Qj(t)+∫0tRj(t-x)dB(x)This renewal equation has a unique solution of the form(4.41)Rj(t)=Qj(t)+∫0tQj(t-x)dM(x)whereM(x)is the renewal function of a renewal process with inter-renewal time distribution B(t). Thus, the application of the key-renewal theorem yields that(4.42)limt→∞Rj(t)→1β∫0∞Q(x)dxThe integral in (4.42) is the probabilistic version ofQ∼jwhen the mean service time on server-II is β. Thus,(4.43)R∼jβ=Q∼j=Qj∗(0)Thus, the lemma holds. □The Stationary PGF P(z)If Lemma 4.1 is applied in (4.15)–(4.29) and (4.30) and then simplified ass→0, one can obtain a compact expression for each member of the sequence{Rj}subject to the condition thatλ⩽μ+1β.

Now, given thatλ=μ, then the lemma holds.Lemma 4.3The stationary distribution{Rj=P(N=j)}of the system size of theM/M,G/2queue exists if and only if(λ3>μ2a)holds wherea=λ2+λμ+μ2.SinceR4is proportional toλ3-μ2aand is positive definite (being a probability value), it is trivial that the stationary distribution{Rj=P(N=j)}of the system size of theM/M,G/2queue exist if(λ3>μ2a)holds. Conversely, suppose(λ3>μ2a)>0. ThenR4is positive definite and so it is proportional to(λ3-μ2a). □For a comparative study on the mean number of customersE[N]and the mean waiting timesW‾of the two models namely; theM/(M+G)/2and theM/M,G/2queues, we suppose that λ varies from15.11to15.81whileμ=8.4andμ2=7.5. Tables 2a and 2bbelow summarize the approximate values for ρ,ρ1leading toE(N)andW‾for the two models studied in this work.18The stability conditionλ<(μ+μ2)holds since(μ+μ2)=15.9>15.81=λmax.18Note that under equilibrium conditions, there is an insignificant difference between(i)E(N)M/M,G/2andE(N)M/(M+G)/2.(ii)W‾M/M,G/2andW‾M/(M+G)/2.Thus, one can conclude that though, some violations of the FCFS principle occurred because of heterogeneity of servers inM/G/2queues generally as pointed out by Krishnamoorthy (1962), the two alternative queue disciplines serial and parallel here minimize such violations in the long run. This is because the steady state characteristics19Both the mean queue length and the mean waiting time.19for theM/M,G/2queue under the parallel queue discipline and that of theM/(M+G)/2queue under the serial queue discipline differ insignificantly as observed in Tables 2a and 2b.Similarly, we infer from these results that, ifρ1is relatively far from one, then it is operationally better to allocate a customer to a server instead of joint service when another customer is present. As can be seen in the tables above, both the mean queue length and the mean waiting time in the latter under the parallel queue discipline is stationary smaller than that of the former. Hence, the parallel queue discipline is a better alternative when arrival rates is not approaching the combined server rates.Similarly, ifρ1→1, then it is operationally better to join service than allocating servers to distinct customers. This is evident from Tables 2a and 2b that whenρ1→1, the expected behavior of the serial model becomes better than that of the parallel model. The results obtained here can be applied in service systems where customer distribution are required for better practice. Most importantly is the new result of our work that under serial queue discipline applied on the two connected servers as in theM/(M+G)/2and parallel queue discipline applied as in theM/M,G/2, given thatλ<(μ+μ2)holds, then the behavior of theM/(M+G)/2and that of theM/M,G/2are identical if and only ifλ3>μ2(μ2+λμ+λ2)holds. This ensures that the associated Markov chain for the customer distribution is ergodic. There is a scope to studying the models discussed here via Markov-renewal theory. This will ensure an equality relationship between the arrival distribution and those specified in Lemma 4.1. Finally, we are grateful to all the sources of literature used and to those that encourage us to see the great work of Boxma et al. (2002) model in a different way.
