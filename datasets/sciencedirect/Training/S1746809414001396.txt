@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the causes of glaucoma which can lead to blindness if not detected and treated at an early stage. Glaucoma symptoms are not always obvious; hence patients seek treatment only when the condition progressed significantly. Early detection and treatment will decrease the chances of vision loss due to glaucoma. This paper proposes a novel automated glaucoma diagnosis method using various features extracted from Gabor transform applied on digital fundus images. In this work, we have used 510 images to classify into normal and glaucoma classes. Various features namely mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, energy, and Shannon, Rényi, and Kapoor entropies are extracted from the Gabor transform coefficients. These extracted features are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the features. Then these features are ranked using various ranking methods namely: Bhattacharyya space algorithm, t-test, Wilcoxon test, Receiver Operating Curve (ROC), and entropy. In this work, t-test ranking method yielded the highest performance with an average accuracy of 93.10%, sensitivity of 89.75% and specificity of 96.20% using 23 features with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Also, we have proposed a Glaucoma Risk Index (GRI) developed using principal components to classify the two classes using just one number.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Glaucoma damages the optic nerve of the eye because of the high intraocular pressure produced due to the imbalance in the production and drainage of the aqueous humor of the eye. The condition progresses with time, and will eventually lead to permanent blindness, if left untreated [1]. There is no cure for glaucoma, but medication can be used to prevent vision loss [2]. Normally, aqueous humor flows out of the eye via the trabecular meshwork. However, when this channel is blocked, the aqueous humor will build up. The rise in this fluid will cause the pressure to build up and results in the death of ganglion cells [3]. Since the ganglion cells are not regenerated, glaucoma patients slowly lose their vision. Study has shown that there will be more than 30% increase in glaucoma cases by 2020 [4]. Currently, it is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. The World Health Organization lists glaucoma as one of the major causes of visual impairment globally [5].Open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma are the two main types of glaucoma [6]. The open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma. Since it is painless and progress at a slower rate, patients might only notice the loss of vision after the condition progressed significantly. In contrast, the angle-closure glaucoma is painful and sudden, and vision is lost at a significant rate [7]. However, due to the noticeable symptoms, patients will seek treatment before permanent damage occurs.Glaucoma diagnosis in the early stage is very crucial in saving vision of the patient. Hence a routine screening of patients might help in detecting the disease in the early stage. Glaucoma is diagnosed by measuring IOP, visual fields and optic nerve head (ONH). Goldmann applanation tonometer can be used to measure IOP [8], Humphrey field analyzer can be used to analyze the visual fields [9] and fundus images to evaluate the cup to disk ratio of the ONH [10]. Measuring IOP and visual fields requires specialized instruments and hence is not suited for mass screening programs where large numbers of patients are required to be screened [11]. ONH appearance can be an ideal method to detect glaucoma which can be used in the mass screening. Ophthalmoscopy or stereo fundus photography of ONH can easily detect these changes and are widely used by ophthalmologists to document the disk, rim, cup areas and disk diameter [12].In recent years digital fundus photography has played a major role in screening the diabetic retinopathy patients [13–16]. The digital fundus photography is non-invasive, cheap and can be used to diagnose different eye abnormalities like glaucoma, diabetes retinopathy, maculopathy and age related macular degeneration. Hence they are ideal for mass screening of glaucoma [17]. This automated diagnosis can also reduce the inter-observer and intra-observer variability errors arising during the screening of the disease by clinicians. Various morphological features like disk, cup and rim areas, disk diameter and cup to disk (C/D) ratio can be easily extracted from the digital fundus image [18].While screening the glaucoma using ONH appearance, cup to disk ratio is used as an important parameter [19] in detecting the glaucoma. A cup size of a healthy person is very small as it contains more than 1.2 million fibers passing through it. When a person is affected by glaucoma, the ONH loses its optic nerve fibers resulting in the increase of cup size. This in turn increases the cup to disk ratio, indicating a glaucomatous change [20]. The cup to disk ratio in a healthy person is usually 0.3 [21]. As the C/D ratio increases, the severity of the glaucoma also increases. A mild glaucoma can have a C/D ratio of 0.4 [22]. A moderate glaucoma can have a C/D ratio of 0.5–0.7. A severe glaucoma can have a C/D ratio of above 0.7. The mild stage is characterized by normal visual field or very less vision loss (side or peripheral). In case of moderate glaucoma even though the C/D ratio is around 0.5–0.7, the central vision may not be affected. The severe stage is characterized by a severe loss of optic nerve fiber, the presence of focal notches (inferior or superior) [23] and optic nerve hemorrhages. The patient may lose the vision if this is uncontrolled. Typical normal, mild, moderate and severe glaucomatous fundus images are as shown in Fig. 1.In recent years computer aided diagnosis (CAD) is playing a major role in screening the glaucoma. The CAD system is simple, repetitive, not prone to inter or intra observer variability and fast in diagnosis [24]. Also CAD can screen many patients in a small time. There is a scarcity of ophthalmologists in many developing countries, where CAD can be very useful. The proposed decision support system for glaucoma can differentiate normal and glaucoma classes accurately. This does not depend on the segmentation of individual ONH features like cup, disk or abnormalities like focal notches, optic nerve hemorrhages where a small error in the segmentation may lead to wrong diagnosis [25]. This is a non-segmentation technique which depends on only on the extracted features, number of images and design of classifiers.In the literature to calculate the C/D ratio authors have segmented optic disk and cup. The optic disk detection are based on template matching [26], Fuzzy convergence [27], contour model based approaches [28], geometric parametric model [29], and Hough transform [30]. Joshi et al. [31] have used depth discontinuity model to detect the C/D ratio (CDR) with a mean CDR error of 0.09. Nayak et al. [32] have used morphological operations for the detection of C/D ratio. Xu et al. [33] have used sparsity based feature extraction technique and SVM classifier for the detection of C/D ratio. Edge detection and thresholding technique are used for the detection of C/D ratio [34]. They have reported a mean CDR error of 0.14.Fig. 2shows the block diagram of the proposed system which is divided into offline and online system. Image pre-processing is the first step in the offline mode where the entire sets of fundus images (normal and glaucoma) are pre-processed. Gabor transform is performed on the fundus images and a number of features such as moments, entropy and energy are extracted. To reduce the dimensionality of the extracted features principle component analysis is performed. Features are ranked using various ranking methods to select the minimum number of features to obtain the highest performance. The ground truth (given by the ophthalmologists) about the class to which the fundus image belongs as well as the extracted significant feature set are then fed to the classifier. The classifier performance is measured using a tenfold cross validation strategy. In the real time mode, the fundus images are pre-processed first and the significant features are extracted from them. The classifier classifies the fundus images into normal and glaucoma based on the extracted significant features.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the Data acquisition of fundus images, Gabor transform, feature extraction, PCA and feature ranking and selection. SVM and NB classifiers and Glaucoma Risk Index are discussed in Section 3. The results obtained from the proposed technique are presented in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the results obtained and the paper concludes in the Section 6.
