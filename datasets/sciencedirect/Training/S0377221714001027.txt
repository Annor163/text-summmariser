@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Stroke disease places a heavy burden on society, incurring long periods of time in hospital and community care, and associated costs. Also stroke is a highly complex disease with diverse outcomes and multiple strategies for therapy and care. Previously a modeling framework has been developed which clusters patients into classes with respect to their length of stay (LOS) in hospital. Phase-type models were then used to describe patient flows for each cluster. Also multiple outcomes, such as discharge to normal residence, nursing home, or death can be permitted. We here add costs to this model and obtain the Moment Generating Function for the total cost of a system consisting of multiple transient phase-type classes with multiple absorbing states. This system represents different classes of patients in different hospital and community services states. Based on stroke patients’ data from the Belfast City Hospital, various scenarios are explored with a focus on comparing the cost of thrombolysis treatment under different regimes. The overall modeling framework characterizes the behavior of stroke patient populations, with a focus on integrated system-wide costing and planning, encompassing hospital and community services. Within this general framework we have developed models which take account of patient heterogeneity and multiple care options. Such complex strategies depend crucially on developing a deep engagement with the health care professionals and underpinning the models with detailed patient-specific data.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Stroke disease, as the single biggest cause of disability in the United Kingdom (UK), is a huge drain on the public purse and, as such, is of particular concern to policy makers. The total societal cost of stroke in the UK has been estimated at nearly £9billion per year (Saka, McGuire, & Wolfe, 2009) of which 50% is accounted for by direct care costs, including hospitalization, outpatient and GP visits, drug costs and community or nursing home care. 27% of the cost is accounted for by informal care costs from family, friends or nonNHS professionals, and the remainder by indirect costs to the economy due to premature death or disablement. It is estimated that 25% of post stroke patients in the UK enter institutional care (Sackley & Pound, 2002). In addition, on-going care such as long-term nursing and community based care place substantial costs on health and social services (Sundberg, Bagust, & Terent, 2003). Our focus in this paper is on extending a previous Markov modeling framework (McClean, Barton, Garg, & Fullerton, 2011) that developed analytic models to describe lengths of stay (LOS) of stroke patients in various components of hospital, social and community care. The aim is to decrease patient delays, efficiently use resources and improve adherence to government targets. Our current work extends the framework to add costs thus facilitating economic evaluation to assess alternative clinical and care strategies.Economic evaluation of health care commonly uses cost models to compare health care strategies, and provide solutions which produce health care benefits for the patient and cost-efficient strategies for the health care provider. Such approaches are particularly important with regard to providing information that facilitates the efficient and fair allocation of scarce resources (Cooper, Abrams, Sutton, Turner, & Lambert, 2003).A number of modeling solutions have been utilized in such contexts, principally macro-economic models which are generally population or cohort based, typically regression, or micro-economic models which are individual based, such as Decision Trees or Markov models. Such models may be analytic (Gillespie et al., 2011) or employ discrete event simulation (DES) (Katsaliaki & Mustafee, 2011), although the former may be limited in terms of detail (McClean et al., 2011) while the latter may have high computational load (Hiligsmann et al., 2009). Cooper, Brailsford, and Davies (2007) have identified the choice of modeling technique to depend on “the acceptance of the modeling technique, model error, model appropriateness, dimensionality and ease and speed of model development”. In particular they argue that Markov models are well suited to simple chronic interventions. The use of Markov models for health care economic evaluation has also been advocated as a way of handling both costs and outcomes simultaneously in a simple and intuitive manner (Briggs & Sculpher, 1998).Although Markov models have been criticized in the past in terms of limited assumptions they can be readily extended in various ways to overcome such limitations. For example, the basic assumptions of the Markov model, such as the Markov property can be relaxed within an analytic framework such as a semi-Markov model (Papadopoulou, Tsaklides, Mcclean, & Garg, 2012). This approach is highly flexible and has the ability to provide a realistic representation of complexity and variability commonly found in heterogeneous health care systems.A key issue which must be addressed within a framework for modeling and costing patient pathways is the heterogeneity of patient pathways and LOS characteristics. Such heterogeneity arises from a number of sources e.g. method of admission, diagnosis, severity of illness, age, gender, treatment (Dimakou, Parkin, Devlin, & Appleby, 2009; Faddy & McClean, 2005; Garg, McClean, Barton, Meenan, & Fullerton, 2012; Harper, 2002; Marshall & McClean, 2004). A number of approaches have therefore been used to cluster LOS data and generate patient groups, some of these have been discussed in McClean et al. (2011). We here build on previous work and base this clustering on survival analysis, although there are a number of other approaches to identifying groups of patients that have similar pathways; costing then becomes specific to the particular pathway a patient is following.Our main objective is to extend a previous modeling framework, with particular applicability to stroke patient care, which associates costs with patient pathways, based on covariates such as age, gender, or diagnosis, using a phase-type distribution. We also encompass multiple outcomes, such as discharge to normal residence, nursing home, or death. We develop an analytic framework for economic modeling using routinely available data. The approach is illustrated using data for stroke patients originally admitted to the Belfast City Hospital (BCH).The analytical cost model for stroke planning is based on Markov phase-type models, where mathematical results are obtained for a basic scenario. Phase-type models are becoming increasingly popular for health care applications (Fackrell, 2009; Harper, Knight, & Marshall, 2012; Knight & Harper, 2012). This work is an extension of the model developed by McClean et al. (2011), and will extend it to include costs. Thus the analytic model can allow us to easily implement and quickly evaluate basic changes for different hospital settings.Coxian phase-type distributions have been previously shown to give a good fit to hospital LOS data,e.g., (Faddy & McClean, 2005; Marshall & McClean, 2004). They are (in our case, continuous time) Markov models that are intuitively appealing as we can think of the patient as progressing through various phases of hospital, social care and community care such as acute, treatment, rehabilitation and long stay (Fig. 1).From the technical point of view, the advantages of using the Coxian phase-type distribution to describe LOS in hospital are (i) their mathematical tractability; (ii) parsimonious parameterization – a general phase-type representation requires a large number of parameters, with associated difficulties in estimation; and (iii) any positively supported distribution can be approximated by a phase-type distribution with an appropriate number of parameters; however, the order of the representation may be large. McClean et al., 2011 developed a framework that classifies patient stays based on identifying homogeneous groups in terms of their LOS distributions; different admission probabilities therefore pertain to different classes. Classes are characterized using appropriate covariates, in this case: gender, age, diagnosis and outcome. Patients in the various classes follow separate pathways, with corresponding different admission probabilities for each class. Another feature of this framework is that, unlike previous work, it allows for a number of absorbing states – for example, these might be the patient’s normal residence, private nursing home or death. Such an approach allows community care to be modeled as well as hospital states thus describing the integrated system of stroke patient care, rather than sub-systems of the overall care process.In this paper we extend this methodology to the Moment Generating Function (MGF) for total cost of a whole integrated care system. In Subsection 2.1 we mathematically describe how Coxian phase-type models can be used to model LOS in hospital, before defining the MGF of LOS in hospital in Subsection 2.2. In the following subsections we will build on this result to define the MGF of hospital and community care, and the MGF ofa system with multiple transient classes and multiple absorbing states. The MGFs are defined in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4, but are proven in Appendices A, B and C.In general, we use Coxian phase type models to describe duration as a k state continuous time Markov model where the absorbing state Sk+1 represents the event death or discharge of the patient (Fig. 1). A patient can be admitted to the system only via the first state. Transitions are possible from any transient state Si(i=1,2,…,k−1) to the next state Si+1 with transition rate λi. Also transitions are possible from any state Sito the absorbing state Sk+1 with transition rate μi(Fig. 1).The infinitesimal transition matrix Q, which consists of the transition rates between the different states, is defined as:Q=-(λ1+μ1)λ10…00-(λ2+μ2)λ2…0...….000-(λk-1+μk-1)λk-10-μkand the absorption matrix, which consists of the transitions from the transient states to the absorbing states, is defined as q=(μ1,…,μk)′.The time spent in the hospital before death or discharge has the probability density functionf(t)=pexp(Qt)qwhere the row vector p={pi} is the initial probability distribution and, for the Coxian model, is defined as p=(1,…,0), and exp(A)=I+A+A2/2!+… for any matrix A.We also note that, by differentiating the series expansion (exp(Qt)), we obtain:ddt(exp(Qt))=(exp(Qt))Q.Also, −Q−1q=e, where e= (1,…,1)′ is a k×1 column vector.For a non-defective phase-type distribution, starting from any transient state (phase), absorption occurs with probability 1 (Latouche & Ramaswami, 1999, Theorem 2.4.2). The matrix P(t)={Pij(t)}=exp(Qt) is the matrix of transition probabilities from transient state Sito transient stateSjin(0,t], so it follows that for a non-defective phase-type model: limt→∞exp(Qt)=0.It is also the case that, for non-defective phase-type distributions, the matrix Q is non-singular (Latouche & Ramaswami, 1999, Theorem 2.4.3). It is a necessary and sufficient condition for a non-defective phase-type distribution that all possible paths starting from a transient state (phase) lead to the absorbing state (Latouche & Ramaswami, 1999, p. 43). This is always true for a Coxian phase-type model with λi+μi>0 for i=1,…,k (defining λk=0). Without loss of generality we therefore assume that our Coxian phase-type distribution is non-defective and hence also non-singular.The MGF of the total length of stay T in the transient states (hospital care) is given by:MT(θ)=-p(Q+θI)-1q.It follows that the first two non-central moments are given by:E[T]=-pQ-1eandE[T2]=2pQ-2e.The MGF of the phase-type distribution is a well known result and can be found in Neuts (1981). An equivalent result, for the MGF of LOS was previously presented in Fackrell (2009) and for costs in Marshall, Shaw, and McClean (2007). In this paper we formulate the expressions in terms of matrices, and below we define the MGF of total costs of LOS in hospital. In the following subsections this work will be extended to included multiple community care states and multiple transient classes, which represent different care pathways.We attach a cost bidt to a stay int,t+dtin phase Si. This allows us to obtain an expression for the MGF of total length of stay and total cost incurred in the transient states; in our case these transient states generally correspond to hospital states.The MGF of the total cost of stay C in the transient states is given by:MC(θ)=-p(Q+θB)-1q.where B is a diagonal matrix with the elementsbi.It follows that the first two non-central moments are given by:E[C]=-pQ-1BeandE[C2]=2p(Q-1B)2e.For a full proof of the MGF of costs in hospital care see Appendix A.We extend the usual phase-type model to a situation where there may be more than one absorbing state. A cost of diis added for entry into each absorbing state Siwhere i=n+1,…,n+m; in our case these generally represent community costs. We define the transition rate from transient state Sito absorbing state Sjas μijwhere:∑j=1mμij=μifori=1,…,k.We can now determine the moments of total cost where we include absorbing states as well as transient states. We define M as the absorption matrix which contains the absorption rates from the transient states to the absorbing states, and D is a diagonal matrix of costs of care in each of the absorbing states. Therefore,M=μ11μ12μ21μ22andD=d100d2.The MGF of total cost of stay C in the system, including costs in absorbing as well as transient states, is given by:M∼C(θ)=-p(Q+θB)-1Mexp(θD)eIt follows that the first two non-central moments are given by:E[C∼]=pQ-2BMe-pQ-1DMeandE[C∼2]=-pQ-1D2Me+2pQ-2BDMe-2pQ-1(Q-1B)2Me.For a full proof of the MGF of cost in hospital and community care see Appendix B.We now extend the model to the case where there are C transient classes, with kcphases (states) in class c, forc=1,…,C,k=∑c=1Ckcphases (states) in all and m absorbing states, Sk+1,…, Sk+mas in McClean et al. (2011). Transitions occur from stateSic(i=1,2,…,kc-1)to the stateSi+1cof class c with transition rateλicand transition is never possible between a transient state in any class and another transient state in a different class. Also transition is possible from any stateSicof class c to the absorbing state Sk+jwith transition rateμijc, for i=1,…, kc, j=1, …, m, c=1,…, C. The entry vector,p,is now a row vector, partitioned into C sub-vectors, where the cthsub-vector pchas first element the probability of entry πcinto phase 1 of the corresponding class and the remaining kc−1 elements are zeros, for c=1,…, C. So, we here generalize the Coxian model in two ways: (1) so that the transient states are a mixture of C Coxians and (2) to extend the number of absorbing states from 1 to m. This new phase-type distribution is also Coxian and, assuming the constituent phase-type distributions are non-defective, as before, the new phase-type distribution is also non-defective, since all possible paths starting from a transient state (phase) in class c lead to an absorbing state, either directly or via other transient states in class c.The transition matrix Q is now given by:Q=Q10..00Q2..0..........00..QCwhereQc=-λ1c+∑μ1jcλ1c..00-λ2c+∑μ2jc..0..........00..-∑μkcjc,,and p= (p1,…, pC) where pc=(πc,0,…,0) is a 1×kcrow vector and πcis the probability of entry into class c for c=1,…, C. As before limt→∞exp(Qt)=0 and Q is non-singular.We define Mcas a k×m matrix of transition rates from the transient states in class c to the multiple absorbing states:Mc=μ11c..μ1mc........μkc1c..μkcmc.M is therefore the absorbing matrix which contains all the sub-absorption matrices for each class and is defined as:M=M10..00M2..0..........00..MC.In addition, we extend our cost models to this situation wherebicis the unit cost for phase i of class c for i=1,…, kc, c=1,…, C. As before, there is also a cost difor entry into eachabsorbing state Siwhere i=n+1,…, n+m.Also, we defineB=B10..00B2..0..........00..BCwhere Bcis the cost matrix for class c,and ecas a 1×kcrow vector.Finally we introduce a cost κcof entry into class c where c=1,…, C.The MGF of the total cost for transient and absorbing states of the multiple transient class, multiple absorbing state model is given by:MC⌢(θ)=-∑c=1Cpceθκc(Qc+θBc)-1Mcexp(θDc)ecIt follows that the first two non-central moments are given by:E[C∼]=∑c=1CpcQc-1BcQc-1Mcec-pcQc-1McDcec-pcκcec=∑c=1Cpcκcec-pcQc-1Bce+pcDceandE[C∼2]=∑c=1Cpcκc2ec-2κcpcQc-1Bcecpc+2κcpcDcec+2pcQc-2Bc2ec-2pcQc-1BcDcec+pcDc2ecIn Appendix C we explain the MGF above in more detail. The general approach is illustrated in Section 3 using several simple examples. However, our main interest in this paper is in extending our framework for modeling patient pathways to provide a means of carrying out economic evaluation of patient treatment and care interventions. In Section 4 we apply our framework to stroke patient data, in particular to patients who are eligible for thrombolysis. Stroke patients enter the care system (initially to hospital); they then move through the hospital pathways until discharge to community care, private nursing home or death occurs. This allows us to better understand the effect of proposed interventions in terms of cost metrics. Also, using such models means that different scenarios can be explored, performance assessed and optimal strategies developed.Our aim is to apply the model to the overall care system, thus encompassing various treatments, different classes or patient pathways, various social and community options and their associated costs. However, in this Section we start by providing results for several simpler special cases of the general model. In Section 4, we will then describe the full framework in more detail and provide associated results.Example 1We initially consider a system with just one class which consists of two transient states S1 and S2 (Fig. 2) and no absorbing phase. This is described by Fackrell (2009) as a ‘drop out’ order two Coxian phase-type distribution. These states could represent acute hospital care (S1) and long-stay hospital care (S2).The MGF for the length of time a patient spends in the system isMT(θ)=-p(Q+θI)-1qwhere p is the admission vector so p=(1,0),Q is the transition matrix given by:Q=-(λ+μ1)λ0-μ2and the rate at which patients move to absorption from each state is q=(μ1,μ2)′.Therefore, the MGF isMT(θ)=μ1λ+μ1-θ+λμ2(λ+μ1-θ)(μ2-θ)The mean length of stay is then found by differentiating the MGF and setting the function equal to zero.MT′(θ)=p(Q+θI)-2qMT′(0)=E[T]=-pQ-1e==1λ+μ1+λ(λ+μ1)μ2The variance of the length of stay is then calculated using the formula σ2=E[T2]−[E[T]]2.MT″(θ)=-2p(Q+θI)-3qMT″(0)=E[T2]=2pQ-2e=2(λ+μ1)2+2λμ22(λ+μ1)+2λμ2(λ+μ1)2andσ2=E[T2]-(E[T])2=1(λ+μ1)2+2λμ22(λ+μ1)-λ2μ22(λ+μ1)2.We now add costs to each transient state; therefore, it costs b1 per unit time in transient state S1 and b2 in transient state S2. For this example B isB=b100b2.We can then calculate the mean cost using the MGF as:MC′(θ)=pQ-1B(I+θQ-1B)-2Q-1qE[C]=MC′(0)=-pQ-1Be=b1λ+μ1+b2μ2.λλ+μ1.The second non-central moment is calculated as:E[C2]=MC″(0)=2p(Q-1B)2e=2b12(λ+μ1)2+2λb1b2(λ+μ1)2μ2+2λb22μ22(λ+μ1)So,σ2=E[C2]-(E[C])2=2b12(λ+μ1)2+2λb1b2(λ+μ1)2μ2+2λb22μ22(λ+μ1)-2b1(λ+μ1)+b2λ(λ+μ1)μ22.We consider a system with two transient states S1 and S2 and two absorbing states S3 and S4 (Fig. 3). There is just one class. Typically the states could be acute hospital care (S1), long-stay hospital care (S2), discharge to the community (S3) and dead (S4).In this systemQ=-(λ+μ11+μ12)λ0-(μ21+μ22),M=μ11μ12μ21μ22and the cost matrix for the transient state and absorbing states areB=b100b2andD=d100d2respectively.The MGF for costing this system which includes community states isMC(θ)=-p(I+θQ-1B)-1Q-1Mexp(θD)eBy differentiating the MGF and setting θ equal to zero we are able to find the mean asMC′(0)=-pQ-1BQ-1Me-pQ-1MDeUsing the knowledge that Me=q (see Appendix A) we can rewrite the mean asMC′(0)=E[C]=-pQ-1Be-pQ-1MDe=b1(λ+μ1)+λb2(λ+μ1)μ2+μ1λ+μ1μ11μ1d1+μ12μ1d2+λλ+μ1μ21μ2d1+μ22μ2d2where μ1=μ11+μ12 and μ2=μ21+μ22.The E[C2] is then:E[C2]=MC″(0)=pQ-1D2Me-2pQ-1BDe+2pQ-2B2e=μ1(λ+μ1)μ11d12μ1+μ12d22μ1+2b1d1μ1+2b12(λ+μ1)μ1+λ(λ+μ1)μ21d12μ2+μ22d22μ2+2b2d2μ2+2b22(λ+μ1)μ2+2b22μ22.The variance is calculated using the equation σ2=E[C2]−(E[C])2So,σ2=λλ+μ12b22μ22+d12μ21μ2+d22μ22μ2+2b22μ2(λ+μ1)+2b2d2μ2-b1λ+μ1+λλ+μ1d1μ21μ2+d2μ22μ2+μ1λ+μ1d1μ11μ1+d2μ12μ1+λb2μ2(λ+μ1)2+μ1λ+μ1d1μ11μ1+d22μ12μ1+2b12μ1(λ+μ1)+b1b2μ1In Fig. 4the mean cost and two standard deviations above the mean cost are plotted against λ, the transition rate from state 1 to state 2. As we see, the costs have high variances which increase rapidly with increasing λ.We consider a system with two transient states S1 and S2 and two absorbing states S3 and S4, where the transient states are separate classes (Fig. 5).In this example,Λ=(π1,π2),Q=-μ100-μ2where μ1=μ11+μ12, μ2=μ21+μ22 andM=μ11μ12μ21μ22,where Λ is the admission vector and πiis the probability of admission to state Si. The μij’s are the discharge rates.The MGF for this example is given as:MC(θ)=∑i=12πieθκi(μi-θbi)-1μi1μi2ed1θ00ed2θ11=∑i=12πiμieθκi(μi-θbi)μi1ed1θμi+μi2ed2θμiTherefore, by differentiating the MGF with respect to θ, and setting θ equal to zero we are able to find the mean.E[C]=MC′(0)=∑i=12κiπi+πid1μi1μi+d2μi2μi+biπiμiWhen we differentiate the MGF and set it equal to zero we getE[C2]=MC″(0)=∑i=12πid12μi1μi+d22μi2μi+2bi2πiμi2+2biπiμid1μi1μi+d2μi2μi+κi2πi+2κibiπiμi+2πiκid1μi1μi+d2μi2μiFig. 6plots the mean average cost per patient against the proportion of patients, πiwho are admitted to state 1. This is a linear relationship as is apparent from the equation.Our stroke model was based on a 5-year retrospective data-set extracted from the Patient Administration System (PAS), and consisted of all patients admitted to the BCH between 1 January, 2003 and 31 December, 2007 with a diagnosis of stroke. The PAS is a computerized system that records patient activity relating to inpatients, outpatients, Accident and Emergency, and case note tracking. In the data collection period there were 33% (n=655) admitted who had been diagnosed with cerebral infarction, 7.8% (n=154) with cerebral hemorrhage, 21.4% (n=425) with transient ischemic attack, and 37.8% (n=751) with unspecified stroke. Stroke patient care in BCH is provided by a stroke unit where the patient undergoes a period of acute care followed by a period of rehabilitation, if required, prior to discharge. Such a unit is common practice in the UK and has been found to reduce mortality and dependency (Langhorne, 2007). Therefore, to build an integrated model for stroke patients we require a second source of data. The second data-set was a 5-year retrospective extract of patients known to us from the PAS data-set who were subsequently discharged from BCH to the South-East Belfast Community Stroke Scheme (rehabilitation). From this data-set we were able to link the records in order to establish the number of contact hours provided in the community by multidisciplinary professionals, typically physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists. This enables us to cost the whole patient pathway, including hospital, social and community components. As such, our framework allows us to develop a whole system model, rather than exploring sub-system components, typically the hospital or social sub-systems.Having previously developed a model for the LOS of a whole integrated patient pathway for stroke patients (McClean et al., 2011) we here explore a particular aspect, namely the evaluation of costs for patients who are eligible to receive thrombolysis. Thrombolysis is an effective treatment for ischemic stroke when administered in a timely fashion, generally regarded to be within 3hours of stroke onset. Although thrombolytic therapy has been licensed for use in the UK since 2003, until recently it was only administered to 3.8% of stroke patients (Royal College of Physicians National Sentinel Stroke Audit Report, 2008). However, stroke services in the UK have been going through a period of change in response to the 2007 revised national stroke strategy which has a strong focus on increasing the proportion of patients being given intravenous thrombolysis. In Northern Ireland (NI) the corresponding target is at least 50% thrombolysis treatment, in those clinically suitable. However, concerns have been raised that other aspects of the stroke service might suffer as a result (Sudlow & Wardlow, 2009). We therefore aim to use our framework to consider if it is beneficial to invest in the provision of thrombolysis in terms of cost. Unique to the UK, NI has an integrated health and social care board and is therefore an ideal platform for examining such issues. When we analyzed data for patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction in the PAS data-set (n=655). Within this group 64% (n=419) are included in the current study having met the NINDS (The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and stroke rt-PA Stroke Study Group (NINDS), 1995) criteria for age (⩽80years) and diagnosis and are thus considered to have been potentially eligible for thrombolysis.In this section we describe how the pathways for stroke patients have been determined. We assume Poisson admissions to the system, where admissions occur to a class. Here (using the terminology of a Markov model) a class represents the pathway of a group of patients with a similar profile. This Poisson assumption was tested using chi-squared and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests and shown to be reasonable for the BCH data (McClean et al., 2011). While we recognize that such an assumption is certainly not reasonable for all health care admission processes, we believe that it is a useful starting point for stroke patient data (McClean et al., 2011). The homogeneous Poisson model which assumes that inter-arrival times have an exponential distribution is the simplest assumption and has been made previously for such data. For example, Taylor, McClean, and Millard (1998) used a Poisson model for the inter-arrival times for weekly admissions of geriatric patients; and De Bruin, Van Rossum, Visser, and Koole (2007) for unscheduled emergency cardiac patient arrivals. However, more complex models for patient admissions have also been proposed. For example, Barnett, Kabolu, Sirio, and Rosenthal (2002) for intensive care admissions and daily variations in the Poisson rate, and Alexopoulos, Goldsman, Fontanesi, Kopald, and Wilson (2008) for patient arrivals at community clinics. Other possibilities have included a piecewise Poisson process for modeling long-term or cyclic trends (Harper, Taranto, Edwards, & Daily, 2000), structural time series analysis such as ARIMA used to incorporate seasonal and local linear trends (Au-Yeung, Harder, McCoy, & Knottenbelt, 2009) and Kuhl, Ivy, Steiger, Wilson, and Wagner (2009) illustrate how other distributions can be employed.In our case, the data is available on a daily basis and arrival rates are low with, on average, just over one patient being admitted per day. Admissions are usually unscheduled and stroke patients arrive one at a time, where the date of admission does not depend much on life-style parameters or on transit related issues. Also, patients tended to stay in hospital for longish periods (on average over four weeks). Previous goodness-of fit tests (McClean et al., 2011) indicate that the initial assumption of homogeneous Poisson arrivals is a reasonable starting point. Our immediate goal is to provide a tool that can provide high-level assistance for planning, as our aim is to provide an initial framework to support health and social services planning. Costs can then be associated with the arrival process, as appropriate.On the basis of survival analyses we create groups (or classes) of stroke patients (McClean et al., 2011), constructed to be homogeneous with respect to the survival distribution of LOS in hospital, and destination of discharge outcomes. These groups were stratified by age, gender and diagnosis, as discussed in McClean et al. (2011). Homogeneity with respect to LOS is achieved using Kaplan–Meier estimators for the respective survival curves and log-rank tests to test for equality. Thus by recursive partitioning and testing for homogeneity of classes an optimal grouping was identified. These groups are not necessarily all at the same level of detail, as the group composition is determined by the tests. However, to be eligible for thrombolytic therapy a patient must have a diagnosis of cerebral infarction, be 80years old or less, and be admitted into hospital within 3hours of stroke onset. Therefore, we found in this model that all the classes have the same level of detail. For example, two of the groups were CIYPNH (cerebral infarction, young, and discharged to private nursing home), and CIYD (cerebral infarction, young, discharged after death). In our model there were 6 classes of patients: 3 classes for patients who received thrombolysis if they were eligible for thrombolysis, and 3 classes for patients who do not receive thrombolysis even though they are eligible for thrombolysis. We have 6 absorbing states which represent the discharge destinations for each of the classes (usual residence, private nursing home and death for those who receive thrombolysis, and usual residence, private nursing home and death for those who do not receive thrombolysis). Usual residence has been further split into those who went to their usual residence and those who went to their usual residence but also require rehabilitation from the South-East Belfast Stroke scheme.The LOS distribution of each group was then modeled using a phase-type model, starting with one phase (exponential) and progressively increasing the number of phases until, using a penalized likelihood approach, an optimal number of phases was determined (Gillespie et al., 2011). For our proposed phase-type model, since our groups (classes) have already been homogenized using survival analysis, one or two phases were sufficient in each case. Differential costs are incurred in each phase and represent the cost of hospital care.For stroke patients, possible discharge destinations are home, rehabilitation, institutional care (PNH), and death. Probabilities of discharge to each of these destinations were estimated from the PAS data-set while for patients who were administered thrombolysis, transition probabilities were derived from the NINDS trial (The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and stroke rt-PA Stroke Study Group (NINDS), 1995).Costs in community and social care states are assumed to be fixed. However, this latter assumption can be easily extended using phase-type distributions to describe stay in such states, if sufficiently detailed data are available. We also assume an additional cost of treatment on entry to the transient hospital states; this may be zero if treatment is not administered.In this paper we want to evaluate the costs for patients who are eligible for thrombolysis. Although an exact value for the extra cost of thrombolytic treatment per patient is difficult to determine, Saka et al. (2009) suggest that a reasonable estimate is £750 per person which includes the cost of the drug at £450 and additional staff time required (Sandercock et al., 2004). The mean LOS in hospital is based on the BCH records, and for those patients who receive thrombolysis the LOS in acute care is estimated to be reduced by 2days or 15% (Saka et al., 2009). The cost of acute care was estimated as £164.80 per person per day and on-going care as £114.80 per person per day (Saka et al., 2009). For PNH care we attach a cost of £81.43 per person per day (Wahlgren et al., 2008) and patients who are discharged to PNHs have a mean length of stay of 11.9months. Finally we attach a cost of £38 per person per hour of client contact for community rehabilitation (Personal Social Services Research Unit, 2006). All the above costs are based on UK figures.The analytic model described in Section 2 will calculate the total expected cost per patient for each pathway (class) in the model and then sums together the cost of all the pathways. Therefore, if a patient is admitted to the first pathway (receives thrombolysis, receives hospital care and is discharge to usual residence with no rehabilitation) then the model sum three costs together. The first cost is the additional cost of thrombolysis treatment; the second cost is that of hospital care and the third is the community care cost. The cost of hospital care is calculated by multiplying the probability of entering each of phases by the mean duration in that phase by the unit cost per patient in the phase. The cost of community care is calculated by multiplying the probability of going to the community care state by the fixed cost of care in that state (Gillespie et al., 2011).Our primary focus in this model is to provide indicative results which suggest that when we take into account the savings from administering thrombolysis in terms of hospitalization, community support and nursing home costs, rather than being a drain on the budget, increasing the proportion of patients who are thrombolysed can actually save money.
