@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we address the issue of vendor managed inventory (VMI) by considering a two-echelon single vendor/multiple buyer supply chain network. We try to find the optimal sales quantity by maximizing profit, given as a nonlinear and non-convex objective function. For such complicated combinatorial optimization problems, exact algorithms and optimization commercial software such as LINGO are inefficient, especially on practical-size problems. In this paper we develop a hybrid genetic/simulated annealing algorithm to deal with this nonlinear problem. Our results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms previous methodologies and achieves more robust solutions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Vendor managed inventory (VMI) has been studied by many researchers because of its impact on the cost efficiency of supply chain networks. Under a VMI system, the vendor determines the timing and quantity of replenishment and has access to the retailer’s inventory and demand data (Darwish & Odah, 2010). A well-designed VMI system can decrease inventory levels and enhance supply chain integration, thereby reducing costs (Achabal, McIntyre, Smith, & Kalyanam, 2000; Angulo, Nachtmann, & Waller, 2004; Çetinkaya & Lee, 2000; Schenck & McInerney, 1998). These benefits have been realized by many successful retailers and suppliers, including Wal-Mart and Procter and Gamble (Yao, Evers, & Dresner, 2007). Due to the growing interest in enhancing supply chain integration, we consider the integrated VMI system model developed by Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007).In order to establish the optimal parameters of a VMI system, a complicated combinatorial optimization problem with a nonlinear non-convex objective function must be solved. Finding the optimal solution to such a problem may be infeasible using traditional algorithms, particularly for larger problem sizes, so robust new methodologies for solving such problems are required. Costa and Oliveira (2001) examined metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA), simulated annealing algorithms (SAA), and evolution strategies (ES), and concluded that these metaheuristic algorithms are well-suited to solving such problems.In this paper we consider two supply chain models that use VMI: a single vendor/single buyer model, and a single vendor/multiple buyer model. We try to find the sales quantity, sales price, and contract price between the vendor and the buyer for each model. A hybrid genetic/simulated annealing algorithm is developed to determine the optimal parameters for each VMI model, and our results are compared with those obtained by Nachiappan and Jawahar (2007) using a genetic algorithm on the same model and the same data.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a comprehensive literature review. The model is presented in Section 3, and the proposed hybrid algorithm is explained in Section 4. The results of a complete computational analysis are presented in Section 5, and a sensitivity analysis is provided in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 presents our conclusions and identifies future research directions.
