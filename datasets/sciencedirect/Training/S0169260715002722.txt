@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a tool for automatic assessment of skeletal bone age according to a modified version of the Tanner and Whitehouse (TW2) clinical method. The tool is able to provide an accurate bone age assessment in the range 0–6 years by processing epiphysial/metaphysial ROIs with image-processing techniques, and assigning TW2 stage to each ROI by means of hidden Markov models.The system was evaluated on a set of 360 X-rays (180 for males and 180 for females) achieving a high success rate in bone age evaluation (mean error rate of 0.41±0.33 years comparable to human error) as well as outperforming other effective methods. The paper also describes the graphical user interface of the tool, which is also released, thus to support and speed up clinicians’ practices when dealing with bone age assessment.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The advancements in computer science have always boosted a large number of scientific fields by both facilitating and hastening the execution of repetitive and/or complex tasks. Image processing methods, in particular, have been used in a variety of applications in diagnostic medicine since their mere conception [1,2] improving the diagnostic accuracy [3,4]. Projection radiography was the first non-invasive method to depict the internal structures of the human body and it is currently one of the most used imaging methods. During the last decades a notable increase of interest in determining accurately the bone age by processing X-Rays, has been observed. This interest arises from the fact that having an accurate and objective assessment of the age of an individual may result extremely useful in many applications ranging from detecting and evaluating hereditary, hormonal or developmental disorders [5,6] to creating indisputable evidence in legal cases where the real age of a person can determine his eligibility for criminal sanctions [7], legal rights [8], etc.In the clinical practices, two approaches have been used for skeletal bone age assessment: the Greulich and Pyle (GP) [9] and the Tanner and Whitehouse (TW) [10] methods. Both approaches have been tested from the scientific community and their validity is already confirmed [11–14].The GP method, which is the simplest and most intuitive one, relies on comparing a subject's X-Ray of the left wrist to a gold standard atlas categorized according to age and sex. The TW2 method uses a-priori knowledge and creates a detailed analysis of the features of twenty predetermined regions of interest (ROIs) located in the left hand's bones, including epiphysis/metaphysis ROI (EMROI), carpal ROI (CROI), radius, and ulna. Each ROI is evaluated by assigning to it a letter, which represents the developmental status, ranging from A, meaning that the bone is completely absent, to I, which represents a fully developed, mature bone. As a final step, by summing up all the ROI scores the effective bone age is calculated.The GP method is less complicated and generally faster than the TW2 method and as a consequence the most used in the clinical practices. However, TW2 offers better reproducibility and accuracy [15] and, because of its modular nature, is proner to automation [16].Although much research has been carried out, the problem of estimating accurately the bone age of an individual is far from being solved [17–19].In this paper we present a method and a tool aiming at determining skeletal bone age based on X-Rays of the left wrist according to a modified version of the TW2 method based on EMROIs only, combined with hidden Markov model-based classifiers for accurate bone development modeling. In the next section a review of the existing approaches is found, while Section 3 describes the proposed method and the GUI based on it. Section 4 reports the performance analysis on a dataset of 360 X-Rays and in the last section, conclusions and future work are given.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this work, we presented an automatic skeletal bone age assessment method (and a tool built on top of it) that implements the TW2 method for EMROI classification and employs Hidden Markov Models for modeling the different stages of development of the bones. The system was tested and compared against existing state-of-the-art methods and outperformed all of them achieving a correct detection rate of more than 95%, when single EMROIs are concerned. Although the system's performance is very good in terms of accuracy, there is much for improvement and in particular in the preprocessing step, where the DoG filter could be replaced by more sensitive and precise image segmentation methods, such as Markov Random Fields [38]. Moreover, the method, at the moment operates only in the range [0-6] years, and we are working on bone age assessment for subjects older than 6 years when most of the bones may be fused.The Skeletal Bone Age tool can be downloaded at http://perceive.dieei.unict.it/download.php.
