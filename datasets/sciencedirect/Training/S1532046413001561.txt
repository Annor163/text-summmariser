Pre-launch evaluation checklist for online health-promoting communities

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
A pre-launch evaluation checklist of online communities was developed.A delicate balance has to be meet between community autonomy and quality control.A comparison with the study context is needed before employing the checklist.Future studies addressing health outcome constructs evaluations are warranted.

BackgroundDespite the apparent potential of online health-promoting communities (OHPC), there is limited guidance available for developers on the basic design features that contribute to successful applications. The aim of this study was to develop a checklist for a pre-launch evaluation of OHPCs incorporating the perspectives of both the user and the health services communities.MethodsThe study was based on an action research design. Constructs previously applied to evaluate information system success were used as the basis for checklist development. The constructs were adapted for the OHPC context and formatively evaluated in a case study project. Evaluation data were collected from participatory observations and analyzed using qualitative methods.ResultsThe initial OHPC checklist included the constructs information quality, service quality, and subjective norms. The contextual adaptation of the information quality construct resulted in items for content area, trust, and format; the adaptation of the service quality construct in items for staff competence, prompt service and empathy; and the adaptation of the subject norms construct in items for social facilitation, interconnectivity and communication. The formative evaluation demonstrated the critical need to balance the autonomy of the online community with the professional control of health services quality expressed in the information and service quality constructs.ConclusionsA pre-launch OHPC evaluation checklist has been designed for use in practical development of health promotion web resources. Research on instruments for OHPC evaluations is warranted.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A checklist for pre-launch evaluation of OHPCs including the constructs: information quality, service quality and subjective norms has been developed. A formative evaluation demonstrated the critical need to balance the autonomy of the online community with the professional control of health services quality expressed in the information and service quality constructs. Future studies addressing health outcome constructs for use in OHPC evaluations are warranted.JE participated in the design of the study, performed the analysis and drafted the manuscript.
