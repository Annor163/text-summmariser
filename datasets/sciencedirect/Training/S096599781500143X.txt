@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The main goal of this paper was to develop an integrated simulation-design of experiments (DOE) model to optimize a petrol station queuing system and sales rate. Initially, the petrol station operating system was simulated using Witness 2014 simulation software©. Then, the responses of simulation were deployed as the input of DOE. Two-level full factorial experiments with center points were performed where the simulated model parameter studied were number of pump, number of cashier and inter arrival times (IATs). The response variables analyzed were queue length and sales rate. The obtained model from experimental design revealed that number of cashier and inter arrival time were significant in determining the queue length while all the factors and their interaction were significantly affecting the sales rate.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Service industries recognized that improving and optimizing their service level is extremely required to increase the efficiency in competitive markets [1]. Customer satisfaction has been announced as one of the most significant parameters of making competitive advantage in service industries [2–5]. Many people use petrol stations’ services in their daily life. Petrol companies can increase their profit through satisfying their customers. In this industry, competitive advantage can be translated into three perspectives of petrol quality and service speed as well as price. Since the quality and price are commonly comparable in majority of the markets, speed service and consequently queue length can be considered as the most influential factor on customer satisfaction and correspondingly the revenue [6].Simulation modeling, mathematical programming and statistics can be considered as useful tools for all managers, researchers and practitioners to analyze dynamic systems without interrupting their operations [7–9]. In addition, simulation modeling of real world cases and its integration with DOE models is a challenge for many practitioners, managers, and researchers [10–14].Since the DOE is an active statistical technique, its integration with simulation can be used to predict a model which can evaluate the effect of significant factors on queuing system. Proposing a simulation-DOE model for the aim of assessing petrol station queuing system and correspondingly sales rate can be beneficial because; (i) Making critical decisions is a serious challenge to top management in different service industries, (ii) Performance of service industry should be exactly assessed due to numerous restrictions in time, cost, labor and different sources of energy, and (iii) Using different tools to optimize processes deprived of interrupting the system operations and evaluate their influence before implementation [15–17].Although the application of simulation in service industries has been discussed by many authors [18–22], only a very few attempts have been made to integrate it with design of experiments. Based on our best of knowledge, there is no integration on evaluating the performance of petrol station queue system.This study contributes to integrate simulation modeling with DOE in order to analyze and optimize a petrol station performance. It introduces a new idea for using computer simulation and proposing different scenarios as the input of DOE. This approach provides a valuable contribution because it is impossible to stop the operating system or change the layout due to constraints of cost, time, labor and many other factors. The novelty of this study lies on integration of simulation and design of experiments in a petrol station which will lead to obtain a predictable model in order to optimize the best scenario for a petrol station considering two perspectives of queue length and sales rate.
