@&#ABSTRACT@&#
With the current expansion of data linkage research, the challenge is to find the balance between preserving the privacy of person-level data whilst making these data accessible for use to their full potential. We describe a privacy-protecting safe haven and secure remote access system, referred to as the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Gateway. The Gateway provides data users with a familiar Windows interface and their usual toolsets to access approved anonymously-linked datasets for research and evaluation. We outline the principles and operating model of the Gateway, the features provided to users within the secure environment, and how we are approaching the challenges of making data safely accessible to increasing numbers of research users. The Gateway represents a powerful analytical environment and has been designed to be scalable and adaptable to meet the needs of the rapidly growing data linkage community.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As many countries worldwide increasingly move towards electronically-held records across the range of public services, there is a growing potential for rich and novel studies through the record-level linkage of these administrative data. This is commonly referred to as data linkage, that is, merging two or more separate datasets containing information about the same individuals so that their topic areas can be studied together (e.g. hospital admissions and education). Indeed, many are of the view that we have a duty to re-use the wealth of data that are routinely collected as part of healthcare (and other public service) delivery to benefit patients and the public. However, there are competing challenges that have to be addressed, namely, how to ensure that individual privacy is protected whilst making the data as accessible as possible. Although some countries have linkable population-based health and social welfare registers [1], large-scale data linkage research is still a fairly novel area with relatively few long-established units, such as those in Australia [2], Canada [3,4], Scotland [5], England [6], as well as the Secure Anonymous Information Linkage System (SAIL) system in Wales [7]. However, it is an area that is developing rapidly with existing work being extended and new units being created. For example, the data linkage infrastructure is being extended across Australia [8], and four new Centres have been established in the UK: two in England, one in Scotland and one in Wales, creating the Farr Health Informatics Research Institute [9]. Among these is the Centre for the Improvement of Population Health through E-records Research (CIPHER) [10], based in Swansea (Wales), which is underpinned by the work of the SAIL system and aims to open up new opportunities to increase collaboration in data linkage research.
