@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Real-time classification of eye movements offers an effective mode for human–machine interaction, and many eye-based interfaces have been presented in the literature. However, such systems often require that sensors be attached around the eyes, which can be obtrusive and cause discomfort. Here, we used two electroencephalography sensors positioned over the temporal areas to perform real-time classification of eye-blink and five classes of eye movement direction. We applied a continuous wavelet transform for online detection then extracted some discriminable time-series features. Using linear classification, we obtained an average accuracy of 85.2% and sensitivity of 77.6% over all classes. The results showed that the proposed algorithm was efficient in the detection and classification of eye movements, providing high accuracy and low-latency for single trials. This work demonstrates the promise of portable eye-movement-based communication systems and the sensor positions, features extraction, and classification methods used.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Real-time eye movement classification is a technique whereby eye movements are measured to determine where a person is looking at any given time and the sequence in which their eyes shift from one location to another. In this way, eye movements can be used as control signals for human–machine interfaces, allowing for interaction with the environment. This offers a potentially useful interface for disabled individuals [1–12].A number of human–machine interfaces (HMIs) have been based on electrooculography (EOG) signals to detect and classify eye movements [13–20], because EOG is a simple and easy method to measure eye movement. However, EOG would be inappropriate for some applications, such as driving a car [21], which would reduce the field of vision. Other drawbacks include discomfort associated with electrodes positioned around the eyes and poor esthetics. Artifact from facial muscles can also affect quality of the EOG signals [22–26]. In light of these problems, electroencephalography (EEG) may offer advantages to EOG [26]. The biggest challenges would be reducing the number of sensors used and extracting appropriate features of eye movements from EOG in the EEG signal.EEG recording is also an alternative method to measure eye movements, since EEG signals include EOG artifacts [27,28]. It would be appropriate for use in applications such as car driving because the sensors do not reduce the field of vision. Another advantage is the inclusion of established positions for EEG sensors. Electrode positions F7 and F8 were shown in our previous work as suitable positions to distinguish between four cardinal eye directions [27]. However, in the previous work, the four cardinal directions of eye movements were offline classified and the electrodes F7 and F8 were attached using EEG cap.The objectives of this study were threefold. First, we presented a novel approach using eye movement signals recorded from EEG electrodes positioned for practical real-world use. Second, we proposed features to discriminate between different kinds of eye movements. Third, we developed a classification algorithm for automatic identification of six classes of eye movements from EEG signals for eye-movement-based communication systems and brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). Hereafter, we describe our recording method, experimental paradigm, and classification results. We then conclude with a discussion on future prospects for eye movement detection from EEG signals.
