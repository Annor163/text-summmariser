@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a solution is proposed to predict the finger joint angle using electromyography (EMG) towards application for partial-hand amputees with functional wrist. In the experimental paradigm, the subject was instructed to continuously move one finger (middle finger for able-bodied subjects and index finger for partial-hand amputees) up to the maximum angle of flexion and extension while the wrist was conducting seven different wrist motions. A switching regime, including one linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier and fourteen state-space models, was proposed to continuously decode finger joint angles. LDA classifier was used to recognize which static wrist motion that the subject was conducting and choose the corresponding two state-space models for decoding joint angles of the finger with two degrees of freedom (DOFs). The average classification error rate (CER) was 6.18%, demonstrating that these seven static wrist motions along with the continuous movement of the finger could be classified. To improve the classification performance, a preprocessing method, class-wise stationary subspace analysis (cwSSA), was firstly adopted to extract the stationary components from original EMG data. Consequently, the average CER was reduced by 1.82% (p<0.05). The state-space model was adopted to estimate the finger joint angle from EMG. The average estimation performance (index R2) of the two joint angles of the finger across seven static wrist motions achieved 0.843. This result shows that the finger's joint angles can be continuously estimated well while the wrist was conducting different static motions simultaneously. The average accuracy of seven static wrist motions with and without cwSSA and the average estimation performance of the two joint angles of the finger prove that the proposed switching regime is effective for continuous estimation of the finger joint angles under different static wrist motions from EMG.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Approximately 18,496 people undergo upper-limb amputations each year in the United States, only second to trauma, cancer or peripheral vascular disease [1]. More than 92% of these upper-limb amputees are partial-hand amputees who have amputation level that is distal to the wrist [1,2], while most of the commercial prostheses companies produce the whole-hand prostheses. Although partial-hand prostheses were widely described in historical research, it is not an amputation level on which researchers and clinicians have focused [3]. It is obvious that partial-hand amputees have been ignored for a long time in the fields of prostheses research and manufacturing.In recent years, two kinds of powered partial-hand prostheses with individually-functioning digits, i.e. ProDigits system (Touch Bionics Inc.) and Vincent finger system (Medical Technics), as shown in Fig. 1, were commercially-available [4]. The control strategies of both systems were still traditional proportional control or on-off switch using surface electromyography (EMG) signals [5,6]. Multi-sensory information, such as force sensitive resistor (FSR), was used in some cases, but those control methods were also very simple. The pattern recognition method has been applied in upper limb amputees for 20 years [7]. However, the acceptance of powered upper limb prostheses based on pattern recognition is still limited, even though the recognition accuracy could be >95% by using the state-of-art technology [8–10]. One main reason is that the pattern recognition based myoelectric control just realizes discrete motions of prosthesis, which is different from the natural and smooth human movements. Users may prefer continuous and intuitive control [11].It is one of the major challenges in myoelectric control to provide simultaneous and proportional control signals for powered hand prostheses with multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) [12]. Proportional control has been studied by many researchers for wrist movements. Non-negative matrix factorization algorithm was adopted to simultaneously estimate the wrist torque of three DOFs by Jiang et al. [13]. A mirrored bilateral training strategy was employed to estimate contra-lateral wrist torque using EMG from the ispi-lateral limb by Nielsen et al. [11]. Then, mirrored bilateral training strategy was adopted to simultaneously and proportionally estimate wrist kinematics in uni-lateral trans-radial amputees by Jiang et al. [14]. Meanwhile, continuous estimation of the finger joint angles from EMG signals was studied by several researchers. Artificial neural network (ANN) was widely used in continuous estimation of finger joint angles from EMG signals [15–17]. Hammerstein-Weiner Model was adopted to continuously decode the finger joint angles from EMG signals [18]. We also did some work on continuously decoding finger joint angles from EMG signals using state-space models [19]. However, all previous methods as mentioned above have not taken wrist movements into consideration, merely let the subject hold his/her wrist at neutral position in the experimental paradigm. Consequently, the estimation performances of continuous movements of the finger were relatively feasible, but inapplicable for partial-hand amputees for the reason that finger movements always exist along with wrist movements which would impair the estimation accuracy of finger joint angles. Thus, the impact of static wrist motions on continuous estimation model of finger joint angles was investigated in this study.A new experimental paradigm was proposed, requiring the subject to move his/her one finger (middle finger for able-bodied subjects and index finger for partial-hand amputees) up to the maximum angle of flexion and extension while his/her wrist was under seven different static motions (neutral position, flexion, extension, radial deviation, ulnar deviation, pronation and supination). A switching regime, including one linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier and fourteen state-space models, was proposed to continuously decode the finger joint angles for partial-hand amputees (Fig. 2). LDA classifier was used to classify which static wrist motion that the subject was conducting and choose the corresponding two state-space models for decoding two joint angles of the finger. One state-space model was adopted to estimate one finger joint angle from EMG. Stationary subspace analysis (SSA) was a method to factorize a high-dimensional multivariate time-series into its stationary and non-stationary components [20]. SSA has been widely used to find stationary brain sources in electroencephalograph (EEG) data to improve the pattern recognition accuracy [21,22]. Class-wise analysis has been used in pattern recognition from EMG signals [23]. In order to achieve higher accuracy of classification, class-wise SSA (cwSSA) was firstly adopted to extract stationary components from raw EMG data.
