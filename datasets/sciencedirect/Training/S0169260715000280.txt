@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Alternative splicing plays a key role in the regulation of the central dogma. Four major types of alternative splicing have been classified as intron retention, exon skipping, alternative 5 splice sites or alternative donor sites, and alternative 3 splice sites or alternative acceptor sites. A few algorithms have been developed to detect splice junctions from RNA-Seq reads. However, there are few tools targeting at the major alternative splicing types at the exon/intron level. This type of analysis may reveal subtle, yet important events of alternative splicing, and thus help gain deeper understanding of the mechanism of alternative splicing. This paper describes a user-friendly R package, extracting, annotating and analyzing alternative splicing types for sequence alignment files from RNA-Seq. SplicingTypesAnno can: (1) provide annotation for major alternative splicing at exon/intron level. By comparing the annotation from GTF/GFF file, it identifies the novel alternative splicing sites; (2) offer a convenient two-level analysis: genome-scale annotation for users with high performance computing environment, and gene-scale annotation for users with personal computers; (3) generate a user-friendly web report and additional BED files for IGV visualization. SplicingTypesAnno is a user-friendly R package for extracting, annotating and analyzing alternative splicing types at exon/intron level for sequence alignment files from RNA-Seq. It is publically available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/splicingtypes/files/ or http://genome.sdau.edu.cn/research/software/SplicingTypesAnno.html.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we present a new R package for annotating and quantifying alternative splicing events at exon/intron level in RNA-Seq data. It can be applied to diverse species with the GTF files. The main purpose of this software is to function as the post-processing tool after RNA-Seq alignment. The main advantages of this package are as follows: (1) it provides annotation for major alternative splicing at exon/intron level. By comparing with the annotation from GTF/GFF file, it identifies the novel alternative splicing sites. In particular, since this tool uses the ratio of two isoforms, the results are not biased toward most abundant transcripts. (2) It offers a convenient two-level analysis: genome-scale annotation and gene-scale annotation. Users can analyze alternative splicing events with rather low computing requirements. A simple laptop enables users to explore alternative splicing for multiple samples. On the other hand, this package is also designed to support parallel computing, which helps speed up analysis for multiple samples at global scale. (3) It generates a user-friendly web report and additional BED files for IGV visualization.There are some limitations of this work. The exon annotation is directly from the user input (GTF file). As a result, it does not recognize the exon structure in the novel genomic features. In addition, the software supports only exon-level annotation for alternative splicing. It does not address the isoform identification. Finally, instead of functioning as a statistical tool, it is an annotating tool for alternative splicing in RNA-Seq data. This package serves as a handy and convenient middleware between alignment software and end users.â€¢Project name: SplicingTypesAnno.Project home page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/splicingtypes/.Operating systems: platform independent.Programming language: R.other requirements: R 2.15.0.License: GNU GPL.Any restrictions to use by non-academics: license needed.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
