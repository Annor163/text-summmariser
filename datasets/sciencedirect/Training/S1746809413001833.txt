@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Intensive insulin therapy has previously shown reduced mortality with lowering blood glucose to between 4.4 and 6.1mmol/l. However presumably due to fear of hypoglycemia the current recommended glycemic target is 7.8–10mmol/l. This study evaluates the effect of modifications to the Glucosafe system on the glycemic outcomes of an in silico cohort and which modifications are necessary to lower mean blood glucose under 6.1mmol/l without hypoglycemic incidents. Based on data from 12 real patients from a previous clinical trial, 12 virtual patients were constructed, the groups were compared and results of the modifications evaluated. Results indicate that virtual patients are applicable in evaluating modifications to advice generation, and that it is possible to lower mean blood glucose below 6.1mmol/l, with no hypoglycemic incidents. In some patients increased insulin use did not achieve this and decreasing nutritional intake was necessary.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Hyperglycemia is common in patients hospitalized for critical illness, trauma or after surgery, and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality [1,2]. Intensive insulin therapy has been tested as a means to achieve glycemic control [3,4] and the Glucosafe system was developed to provide decision support for control of stress hyperglycemia in the intensive care unit (ICU). The Glucosafe system consists of two modules. The first module is a mathematical model of glucose metabolism [5], which can be used to simulate and predict future blood glucose (BG) concentrations. The second module of Glucosafe is used for generating advice [6].The advice generator provides advice in the form of suggestions for the next doses of insulin and nutrition to be administered to the patient. The advice generator evaluates the effect that different suggestions have on the predicted future BG using the metabolic model. The optimal advice is the advice that gives the most desirable outcome over the next four hours in terms of predicted BG, insulin dose and nutritional intake. To decide which amount of nutrition and insulin, as well as the predicted four-hour BG profile constitutes the “most desirable” outcome, the advice generator uses a set of penalty functions [6].The landmark study of Van den Berghe et al. [3] used intensive insulin therapy to target a BG range of 4.4–6.1mmol/l. A mean morning BG of 5.7mmol/l was achieved, but this also resulted in 5% of patients experiencing hypoglycemic incidents (BG<2.2mmol/l). The study showed an 42% reduction in mortality, but presumably due to the fear of hypoglycemia which have been shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality [7,8], higher BG targets (7.8–10mmol/l) have since been recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and by the American Diabetes Association [9].The Glucosafe system has twice previously been tested clinically for its ability to lower BG without inducing hypoglycemic incidents. In both studies Glucosafe targeted a BG of 5.5mmol/l. In the first study a mean BG of 7.0mmol/l (±1.1mmol/l) was achieved, significantly lower than in the 24hour pre- and post-intervention periods [10]. In the second study a mean BG of 7.0mmol/l (±1.19mmol/l), significantly lower than the control group, was achieved [11]. Despite these promising results, neither trial successfully achieved a mean BG for the respective cohorts in the 4.4–6.1mmol/l band and the authors suggested the penalty functions for advice generation be adjusted [10].The target BG of 5.5mmol/l was not achieved by Glucosafe, because the goal of a BG of 5.5mmol/l conflicts with the reluctance to give large doses of insulin and with the reluctance to underfeed the patients. The balance between BG, insulin and nutritional goals is expressed through the penalty functions (see Section 2) and a further reduction in BG could therefore be achieved by reducing the penalty associated with large insulin doses, reducing the penalty associated with underfeeding or both. Evidence supports that managing BG by permissive underfeeding [12] may be a clinically acceptable alternative or supplement to large insulin doses. As the study by Van den Berghe resulted in a greatly lowered mortality and as Glucosafe seems able to lower BG without hypoglycemic incidents, there is reason to reconsider clinical trials with low BG targets. Therefore there is a need to determine which penalty functions, if any, will allow Glucosafe to lower BG into the 4.4–6.1mmol/l band.In this study we will investigate if virtual patients [13], derived from real patient data, can be used to suggest modifications to the penalty functions used by the Glucosafe advice generator. We will run the Glucosafe system on virtual patients to determine the modifications of the penalty functions required to reduce the average BG for the virtual patients to within the band of 4.4–6.1mmol/l.Provided the model has good predictive accuracy, then this should also apply to real patients. As previous evaluations have shown that Glucosafe has good predictive accuracy, irrespective of the BG level and for different insulin and nutrition regimes. This indicates that the modifications determined from the virtual patients may be used as a reasonable starting point for a subsequent clinical trial.
