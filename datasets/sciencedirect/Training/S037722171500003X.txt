@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Based on the concept of sparse connection, three start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection are introduced which are called CSTF with sparse d1, TSCF with sparse d2 and CSCF with sparse d3 and d4. The traditional start-up demonstration tests such as CSTF, TSCF and CSCF are special cases of these new tests. Furthermore, the new tests exhibit obvious improvement in test efficiency. In this paper, by using the finite Markov chain imbedding approach, several probabilistic indexes are given for these new start-up demonstration tests based on the assumption that the tests are i.i.d. case. The analyses are also extended to independent and non-identical and Markov dependent cases. In addition, procedures are provided in order to determine the optimal parameters needed in a demonstration test for selecting the products to meet the reliability requirement. Three comparison analyses are finally presented in order to illustrate the high efficiency of these new start-up demonstration tests and the effectiveness of this method.AcronymCSconsecutive successesconsecutive successes total failurestotal successes consecutive failurestotal successes total failuresconsecutive successes consecutive failuresconsecutive successes distant failurestotal successes consecutive successes total failurestotal successes consecutive successes total failures consecutive failuresruns of consecutive successes total successes R2 runs of consecutive failures total failuresconsecutive successes with sparse d1 total failurestotal successes consecutive failures with sparse d2consecutive successes with sparse d3 consecutive failures with sparse d4the number of consecutive successes required for acceptancethe number of total successes required for acceptancethe number of consecutive failures required for rejectionthe number of total failures required for rejectionthe maximum number of failed start-ups between two successful start-ups or the maximum number of successful start-ups between two failed start-upsthe test length until termination of the testexpected value of Lprobability of success, failure at each trial (i.i.d.)the producers’ riskthe consumers’ risk

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Start-up demonstration tests are very important to spacecraft propulsion systems, emergency lighting systems, and other various engineering systems, because if these systems fail to start up, it will result in serious consequences such as large economic losses and casualties. Hence, a start-up demonstration test is very important as a method for selecting equipment with high start-up reliability during adoption process. By this method, a customer should judge whether the start-up reliability of the equipment meets the reliability requirement before purchasing it by observing the outcomes of a set of tests on the equipment.In a start-up demonstration test, the judging criterion of start-up reliability levels is related to the numbers of successes and failures in several trials which form the acceptance and rejection criteria. In general, the acceptance criterion can be divided into two criteria: consecutive successes and total successes. The rejection criterion can also be fallen into two categories: consecutive failures and total failures. Based on the combinations of different acceptance and rejection criteria, start-up demonstration tests can be divided into several categories such as CS, CSTF, TSCF, CSCF, TSTF, CSDF, TSCSTFCF, etc. The simplest and original start-up demonstration test is called CS (consecutive successes) which has been presented by Hahn and Gage (1983), and Viveros and Balakrishnan (1993). By adding a rejection criterion to CS models, Balakrishnan and Chan (2000) proposed a new start-up demonstration test called CSTF (consecutive successes total failures). In terms of the assumption that the start-ups are i.i.d. cases, they also derived the probability generating function of the length of the start-up demonstration test. After that, Smith and Griffith (2005, 2008) easily obtained the probabilities of acceptance and rejection, the probability mass function, distribution function, mean and variance of the test length by using the Markov chain approach which is also adapted to non i.i.d. cases. They also studied procedures to find the appropriate parameters of start-up demonstration tests and methods to estimate the start-up reliability of the equipment. Besides, they analyzed and compared the advantages of different tests in certain situations by introducing two new start-up demonstration tests: TSTF (total successes total failures) and CSCF (consecutive successes consecutive failures). By conditioning on the time of the first failure, Martin (2004) derived several results for demonstration tests of the start-up reliability of equipment. He also gave recursive formulas for computing the probability distribution of the number of start-ups and the probability of acceptance or rejection of the equipment in a specified number of trials. The auxiliary Markov chains were used by Martin (2008), who derived probabilistic results for five types of start-up demonstration tests, with start-ups that are Markovian of a general order. Antzoulakos, Koutras, and Rakitzis (2009) introduced the CSDF (consecutive successes distant failures) model and studied a new acceptance/rejection rule which is suitable to use in start-up demonstration tests. As extended models of CSTF, TSCSTF (total successes consecutive successes total failures) and R1-CS/TS/R2-CF/TF (R1 runs of consecutive successes, total successes, R2 runs of consecutive failures, total failures) were proposed by Gera (2010) and Zhao (2014) respectively. Gera (2011) also improved the CSTF test to TSCSTFCF test (total successes consecutive successes total failures consecutive failures) and then he generalized this model to include dependent tests according to the previous-sum dependent model (Gera, 2013). As a generalization of CSDF model, Gera (2013) introduced TSCSTFDF test which has significant reduction in the expected number of required tests together with improved second-order statistics (standard deviation). Zhao (2013) extended the application of start-up demonstration tests to the case of products with start-up delay, and he also presented the method for evaluating the indexes related to the test length by using the finite Markov chain imbedding approach. Yalcin and Eryilmaz (2012) studied the TSTF test under previous-sum dependent model and derived the main characteristics for the TSTF test in such condition.The naming of a start-up demonstration test model is very straightforward, for example, if kC consecutive successes are observed prior to a total of fT failures, then the equipment will be accepted; inversely, if fT total failures are observed prior to kC consecutive successes, it will be rejected (Smith & Griffith, 2005). We call this CSTF test. The start-up demonstration test will be terminated if the equipment is either accepted or rejected. The definitions of other start-up demonstration tests are similar to that of CSTF test only by replacing “consecutive” and “total” appropriately.In this paper, the previous start-up demonstration tests are further generalized by considering the concept of sparse connection, and three new start-up demonstration tests are proposed which are called CSTF with sparse d1, TSCF with sparse d2 and CSCF with sparse d3 and d4. In Section 2, the models of different start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection are presented. In Section 3, by using the finite Markov chain imbedding approach, it is possible to obtain the probability mass function, the distribution function, the mean of the test length, the acceptance and rejection probabilities of these three new models. Besides, the analyses are generalized to non i.i.d. cases. Procedures to find the optimal parameter values of start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection are proposed in Section 4. Section 5 presents two comparison analyses between new and traditional models with numerical examples showing that the new models are always more efficient than the traditional models. The summary and some concluding remarks are given in Section 6.Based on the CSTF, TSCF, CSCF and the concept of sparse connection proposed by Zhao, Cui, and Kuo (2007), we present three start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection: CSTF with sparse d1, TSCF with sparse d2 and CSCF with sparse d3 and d4. As to the start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection in this paper, we only consider the cases of that there are two states in each single trial, success and failure. The difference between these new start-up demonstration tests and ordinary start-up demonstration tests is the redefinition of “consecutive”. The concept of sparse connection is introduced as follows.Definition 1The start-up results are outputted in turn, forming a sequence of outcomes. If there are no successful start-ups between two adjacent successful start-ups and the number of failed start-ups between the two successful start-ups is dior less, then the two successful start-ups are called two consecutive successes with sparsedi. Likewise, if there are no failed start-ups between two adjacent failed start-ups and the number of successful start-ups between them is dior less, these are two consecutive failures with sparse di.For example, an outcome sequence of twenty trials is {SFFFSSSFSFSFFSFFFFSS}, based on Definition 1, consecutive successes or failures with different diare shown in Fig. 1.Definition 2In a start-up demonstration test, the equipment under test will be accepted if kC consecutive successes with sparse d1 are observed prior to a total of fT failures; it will be rejected, if fT total failures are observed prior to kC consecutive successes with sparse d1. We call this model CSTF with sparse d1.Analogously, there is also a start-up demonstration test called TSCF with sparse d2. The difference between TSCF with sparse d2 and CSTF with sparse d1 lies in sparse connection and the value of di. The former is consecutive failures with sparse d2 and the latter is consecutive successes with sparse d1. The acceptance and rejection criteria of TSCF with sparse d2 are similar to that of CSTF with sparse d1 only with interchanging the “successes” with “failures” properly.Definition 3In a start-up demonstration test, the test will be terminated either kC consecutive successes with sparse d3 are observed prior to fC consecutive failures with sparse d4, leading to acceptance of the equipment; or fC consecutive failures with sparse d4 are observed prior to kC consecutive successes with sparse d3, leading to rejection of the equipment. We call this model CSCF with sparse d3 and d4.In terms of definitions of start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection, it is not hard for us to find that there are certain relationships between the new start-up demonstration models and the ordinary start-up demonstration models. When the parameters of these new start-up models satisfy some rules, the new models will degenerate to original models. The relationships between different models are shown in Fig. 2.In Fig. 2, the conditions (1)–(9) are as follows: (1) d1 = 0, (2) d3 = 0 and d4 = 0, (3) d3 = 0, fc= 2 and d4 = r − 2, (4) d2 = 0 (5) d3 = d1 and d4 = kT, (6) d3 = fT and d4 = d2, (7) d1 = fT, (8) d3 = fT and d4 = kT, (9) d2 = kT.In conclusion, the ordinary start-up demonstration tests are special cases of start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection, that is to say, the new start-up demonstration tests are generalizations of the original models.In this section, the statistical properties will be examined by using a finite Markov chain imbedding approach (Bersimis, Koutras, & Maravelakis, 2014; Cui, Xu, & Zhao, 2010; Fu, 1986; Fu & Koutras, 1994; Zhao & Cui, 2009). First, the tests are assumed to be i.i.d. with constant probability of successful start-up p and q = 1 − p, then probability analyses based on the assumption of i.i.d. are extended to non i.i.d. situations.In order to analyze the CSTF with sparse d1 test, let's consider a Markov chain {Ym, m ≥ 0} defined on the state space:ΩCSTF−d1={(s,t,r):0≤s<kC,r≤t<fT,0≤r≤d1}∪{Ea}∪{Er},where r = 0, if s = 0. For a sequence of outcomes of the first m start ups, a Markov chain {Ym, m ≥ 0} can be defined as below:Ym=(Sm,d1,Tm,Rm),form≥0,whereSm,d1,Tm,Rmare random variables.Sm,d1represents the number of last consecutive successes with sparse d1. Tmrepresents the number of total failures. Rmrepresents the number of trailing failures after the first m trials ifSm,d1is not zero, otherwise, Rmis always noted as “0” ifSm,d1is zero (“0” is just a symbol in this situation). The initial state is Y0 = (0, 0, 0).Note that both Eaand Erare absorbing states. Eaindicates that after the first m trials, kC consecutive successes with sparse d1 occur before fT total failures and the start-up demonstration test is ended up with accepting the equipment. Er indicates that after the first m trials, fT total failures occur before kC consecutive successes with sparse d1 and the start-up demonstration test is ended up with rejecting the equipment.For CSTF with sparse d1, given 11 trials with an outcome sequence {FSFFFSSFSSF}, when d1 = 2, we have:{Y0=(0,0,0),Y1=(0,1,0),Y2=(1,1,0),Y3=(1,2,1),Y4=(1,3,2),Y5=(0,4,0),Y6=(1,4,0),Y7=(2,4,0),Y8=(2,5,1),Y9=(3,5,0),Y10=(4,5,0),Y11=(4,6,1)};when d1 = 3, we have:{Y0=(0,0,0),Y1=(0,1,0),Y2=(1,1,0),Y3=(1,2,1),Y4=(1,3,2),Y5=(1,4,3),Y6=(2,4,0),Y7=(3,4,0),Y8=(3,5,1),Y9=(4,5,0),Y10=(5,5,0),Y11=(5,6,1)}.Before constructing the one-step transition probability matrix Λm, the transition probabilities in Λmare given as follows:a)P(Ym= (s + 1, t, 0)|Ym − 1 = (s, t, r)) = p, if 0 ≤ s < kC − 1, r ≤ t < fT, 0 ≤ r ≤ d1;P(Ym= (s, t + 1, r + 1)|Ym − 1 = (s, t, r)) = q, if 0 < s < kC, r ≤ t < fT − 1, 0 ≤ r < d1;P(Ym= (0, t + 1, 0)|Ym − 1 = (s, t, r)) = q, if 0 < s < kC, r ≤ t < fT − 1, r = d1;P(Ym= (0, t + 1, 0)|Ym − 1 = (s, t, r)) = q, if s = 0, r ≤ t < fT − 1, r = 0;P(Ea|Ym − 1. = (s, t, r)) = p, if s = kC − 1, r ≤ t < fT, 0 ≤ r ≤ d1;P(Er|Ym − 1. = (s, t, r)) = q, if 0 ≤ s < kC, t = fT − 1, 0 ≤ r ≤ d1;P(Er|Er) = 1;P(Ea|Ea) = 1;All other transition probabilities are zero.According to the above rules, it is not hard for us to construct the one-step transition probability matrix Λmfor the Markov chain {Ym, m ≥ 0}. As an illustration, for CSTF with sparse d1 with d1 = 1, kC = 3, fT = 2, the state spaceΩCSTF−d1isΩCSTF−d1={(0,0,0),(0,1,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0),(2,0,0),(2,1,0),(1,1,1),(2,1,1)}∪{Ea}∪{Er},Hence, the transition probability matrix Λmof this imbedded Markov chain {Ym, m ≥ 0} is:Λ=(0,0,0)(0,1,0)(1,0,0)(1,1,0)(1,1,1)(2,0,0)(2,1,0)(2,1,1)EaEr[0qp0000000000p00000q0000qp0000000000p00q000000p00q0000000qp000000000pq00000000pq00000000100000000001]10×10Much similar to CSTF with sparse d1, the state spaceΩTSCF−d2of TSCF with sparse d2 can be constructed. Additionally, the transition rules of TSCF with sparse d2 are also analogous to that of CSTF with sparse d1 only with replacing “consecutive” and “total” appropriately, so we omit them here.As to CSCF with sparse d3 and d4, we define a Markov chain {Yl, l ≥ 0} on the state space as following:ΩCSCF−d3−d4={(s,t,u,v):v≤s<kC,u≤t<fC,0≤u≤d3,0≤v≤d4}∪{Ea}∪{Er},where u = 0 and v = 0, if s = 0 or t = 0; u = 0, if v ≥ 1; v = 0, if u ≥ 1. For a sequence of outcomes of the first l start-ups, a Markov chain {Yl, l ≥ 0} can be depicted as follows:Yl=(Sl,d3,Tl,d4,Ul,Vl),forl≥0,The random variableSl,d3represents the number of last consecutive successes with sparse d3.Tl,d4represents the number of last consecutive failures with sparse d4. Ulrepresents the number of trailing failures if Vlis “0” (“0” is just a symbol in this situation). Vlrepresents the number of trailing successes if Ulis “0” (“0” is just a symbol in this situation).Apparently, the initial state is Y0 = (0, 0, 0, 0). Eaand Erare absorbing states. For example, a sequence of outcomes {FSSSSFFSFS}, when d3 = 1, d4 = 2, we have:{Y0=(0,0,0,0),Y1=(0,1,0,0),Y2=(1,1,0,1),Y3=(2,1,0,2),Y4=(3,0,0,0),Y5=(4,0,0,0),Y6=(4,1,1,0),Y7=(0,2,0,0),Y8=(1,2,0,1),Y9=(1,3,1,0),Y10=(2,3,0,1)},when d3 = 2, d4 = 2, we have:{Y0=(0,0,0,0),Y1=(0,1,0,0),Y2=(1,1,0,1),Y3=(2,1,0,2),Y4=(3,0,0,0),Y5=(4,0,0,0),Y6=(4,1,1,0),Y7=(4,2,2,0),Y8=(5,2,0,1),Y9=(5,3,1,0),Y10=(6,3,0,1)}.Fig. 3 displays a flowchart to generate the one-step transition probability matrix and it does not include the transitions from two absorbing states to other states.With the above rules, the one-step transition probability matrix Λlcan be constructed easily. For example, the Markov chainYl=(Sl,d3,Tl,d4,Ul,Vl)with d3 = 1, d4 = 1, kC = 2, fC = 3 has the state space as follows:ΩCSCF−d3−d4={(0,0,0,0),(0,1,0,0),(0,2,0,0),(1,0,0,0),(1,1,1,0),(1,1,0,1),(1,2,1,0),(1,2,0,1)},And the transition probabilities of different states are shown in Fig. 4.Finite Markov chain imbedding approach is a very effective method to derive the probabilistic indexes of all kinds of start-up demonstration tests. Before we apply the Markov chain method, we should first partition the one-step transition probability matrix Λ into four blocks:Λ=[QNT×NTRNT×202×NTI2×2],T is the set of all transient states. |Ω| is the cardinality of the state space Ω and we can define NT = |Ω| − 2 to indicate the number of transient states. Hence,QNT×NTrepresents one-step transient matrix among transient states.RNT×2stands for one-step transient matrix from transient states to absorbing states and02×NTwhich is a zero matrix represents one-step transient matrix from absorbing states to transient states. I2 × 2 represents one-step transient matrix among absorbing states which is an identity matrix.Based on the above partitions, by employing the finite Markov chain imbedding approach, we can use the sub-matrixes ofΛto derive the acceptance and rejection probabilities and other indexes related to the test length. Eqs. (1)–(4) are applied to the original start-up demonstration tests as well as the start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection. For different tests, we just need to substitute the different sub-matrixes into the following equations.(1)P(rejection)=π0MRuR=1−P(acceptance),(2)P(L≤l)=π0∑i=0l−1QiR12,(3)P(L=l)=π0Ql−1R12,(4)E(L)=π0M1(|Ω|−2),Here,π0=(1,0,…,0)1×NT, M = (I − Q)−1, uR = (0, 1)T, Q0 = I, 1ais a column vector of ones with length a.Eq. (1) gives the probabilities of rejection and acceptance; Eq. (2) is the distribution function of test length L; Eq. (3) is the probability mass function of test length and Eq. (4) is the expected value of test length L. All the above equations were proved by Viveros and Balakrishnan (1993).In the previous sections, it is assumed that the successful and failed start-up probabilities are previously known. In this section, we will give the statistical inference of the probabilities of successful and failed start-ups by using the maximum likelihood methods. A total of n demonstration tests are performed on a bunch of identical units for the same parameter values. Once the acceptance or rejection criterion is satisfied, the set of tests will be terminated. For the ith test, let si, fidenote the number of successes and failures respectively. In this way, a set of (si, fi) vectors is obtained. The joint likelihood function L(p, q) is then derived. It is easy to see thatL(p,q)=psqfwheres=∑i=1nsi,f=∑i=1nfiThe maximum likelihood estimators of p, q are then derived via the log-likelihood function. Thus, it is required to solve the system of equations:∂lnL(p,q)∂p=0,∂lnL(p,q)∂q=0.After some algebraic manipulation, we getp^=ss+f,q^=fs+f.Refer to the method used by Gera (2013), the observed Fisher information is:I(p^)=s+fp^(1−p^),I(q^)=s+fq^(1−q^).And the interval estimate of p and q will be given byp^±zα/2I(p^),q^±zα/2I(q^).The analyses on start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection in the above sections are based on the assumption that the tests are i.i.d. In this section, the studies will be extended to non i.i.d. cases.When the start-up tests are independent and non-identically distributed, that is to say, the successful probability of the hth trial is ph, and the failed probability is qh= 1 − ph. The analyses based on this assumption are similar as the analyses for i.i.d. tests only with replacing the p with phand q with qhin both transition rules and the one-step transition probability matrix. For the illustration of CSTF with sparse d1 in Section 3.1, the one-step transition probability matrix should be written as follows for the case of independent and non-identically distributed units. Besides, for the case of independent and non-identically distributed units, the probability of the rejection and acceptance, the distribution function of test length L, probability mass function of test length L and the expected value of test length L are shown as Eqs. (1′)–(4′).Λh=(0,0,0)(0,1,0)(1,0,0)(1,1,0)(1,1,1)(2,0,0)(2,1,0)(2,1,1)EaEr[0qhph0000000000ph00000qh0000qhph0000000000ph00qh000000ph00qh0000000qhph000000000phqh00000000phqh00000000100000000001]10×10.(1′)P(rejection)=π0∏h=1nmaxΛhU(Er)=1−π0∏h=1nmaxΛhU(Ea)=1−P(acceptance),(2′)P(L≤l)=π0∏h=1lΛh(U(Ea)+U(Er)),(3′)P(L=l)=π0(∏h=1lΛh−∏h=1l−1Λh)(U(Ea)+U(Er)),(4′)E(L)=π0∑n=1nmaxn(∏h=1nΛh−∏h=1n−1Λh)(U(Ea)+U(Er)),where, U(Ea) and U(Er) are NT × 1 vectors, in which the elements corresponding to the absorbing states Eaand Erare 1s respectively and other elements are all 0s; U(Ea) + U(Er) = (0, 0, …, 0, 1, 1)T; nmax is the upper bound of the start-up demonstration test lengths and this upper bound can be obtained. For example, for a CSTF with sparse d1 (d1 = 1, kC = 3, fT = 5) and the upper bound of its test length is 11; that is to say, after 11 trials at most, the test must be terminated.When the start-up demonstration tests are higher-order (including first-order) Markov dependent, the analyses are different from that of i.i.d. cases. According to the analyses for the higher-order (including first-order) Markov dependent start-ups proposed by Zhao (2014), we can study the higher-order (including first-order) Markov dependent start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection as below.Using CSTF with sparse d1 as an example, m-order Markov dependent start-up tests mean that the outcome of the hth trial has something to do with the last m test results. In other words, the results of the (h − m)th, (h − m + 1)th, (h − m + 2)th, …, (h − 1)th tests have an effect on the hth trial. The Markov chain {Yh} is initialized at time m. A new element is introduced to the state space of CSTF with sparse d1, that is to say, (s, t, r) is changed to (sh, th, rh, yh) to illustrate the state of the first h tests, where yh= (yh − m + 1, yh − m + 2, …, yh) is a m-dimension vector which represents the combinations of all possible results of last m tests.To illustrate the initial probability under this situation, we introduce another m-dimension vector xm= (x1, x2, …, xm) to represent the first m test results; and xican take on only two values: 0 (successful start-up) and 1 (failed start-up), so there are 2mpossible results for Xm= (X1, X2, …, Xm). Besides, when h = 1, 2, …, m, the current state (sh, th, rh) is determined by (x1, x2, …, xm). If h = 1, we set s1 = 1 − x1, t1 = x1, r1 = 0; when h = 2, 3, …, m, we have:sh={sh−1+1,ifxh=0,0≤sh−1<kC−1,rh−1≤th−1<fT,0≤rh−1≤d1,sh−1,ifxh=1,0≤sh−1<kC,rh−1≤th−1<fT−1,0≤rh−1<d1,0,ifxh=1,0≤sh−1<kC,rh−1≤th−1<fT−1,rh−1=d1,kC,ifxh=0,sh−1=kC−1,rh−1≤th−1<fT,0≤rh−1≤d1orsh−1=kC,th={th−1+1,ifxh=1,0≤sh−1<kC,rh−1≤th−1<fT−1,0≤rh−1≤d1,th−1,ifxh=0,0≤sh−1<kC−1,rh−1≤th−1<fT,0≤rh−1≤d1,fT,ifxh=1,0≤sh−1<kC,th−1=fT−1,0≤rh−1≤d1orth−1=fT,rh={rh−1+1,ifxh=1,0≤sh−1<kC,rh−1≤th−1<fT−1,0≤rh−1<d1,0,ifxh=0,0≤sh−1<kC−1,≤th−1rh−1<fT,0≤rh−1≤d1orxh=1,0≤sh−1<kC,rh−1≤th−1<fT−1,rh−1=d1.For each xm= (x1, x2, …, xm), a probability of an initial transient state π0(sm, tm, rm, xm) can be obtained. Probabilities of initial absorbing states Eaand Ercan be calculated through summing over xm= (x1, x2, …, xm) with sh= kC or th= fT. Hence, the initial probabilityπ0 of the Markov chain {Yh} can be obtained.The transition rules for higher-order Markov dependent case should also be considered. A new m-dimension vector vi= (v1i, v2i, …, vmi) (1 ≤ i ≤ 2m) is introduced to denote one of the possible results of the last consecutive m tests and if yh − 1 = vi, it means that the results of the last m tests are just the ith possibility, and two equations are derived as follows:(5)P(yh=(v2,v3,…,vm,1)|yh−1=vi)=pi,(6)P(yh=(v2,v3,…,vm,0)|yh−1=vi)=qi.A detailed flow is shown in Fig. 5for determining the transition rules of CSTF with sparse d1 on the m-order Markov dependent assumption.Obviously, the test length L of each trial is determined by the values of kC, kT, fC, fT, diand the probability of success or failure. It is possible for us to choose the optimal parameters in order to shorten the test length. The optimal parameters should satisfy the following objective function and constraint conditions:(7)MinE(L)s.t.{P(accepted|p≥pa)≥1−α,(8)P(accepted|p≤pr)≤β.(9)It means thatwhen the probability of success p ≥ pa, we should accept the equipment with a higher probability. If p ≤ pr, we should accept the equipment with a lower probability. Here we call α the producer's risk and β the customer's risk. Otherwise, P(Accepted) is an increasing function in p, and P(Rejected) is a decreasing function in p, so (8) and (9) can be rewritten as (8’) and (9’) (Smith & Griffith, 2008):s.t.{P(accepted|p=pa)>1−α,(8′)P(accepted|p=pr)<β.(9′)Once the values of α and β are specified, there may be many combinations of parameters that satisfy (8′) and (9′). For each combination (kC, fT, d1), (kT, fC, d2) or (kC, fC, d3, d4), we can get an expected value of test length L, and we could choose the optimal set of parameters as the one that results in the shortest expected test length L. Processes of determining parameters for CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 are shown in Fig. 6.Procedures to select optimal parameters of CSTF with sparse d1 and TSCF with sparse d2 can be derived from procedures of CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 when the values of d3 and d4 satisfy the rules (5) and (6) provided in Section 2, so we omit them here.In this section, according to the above detailed processes, we wrote programs which implement the equations in Section 4 in order to illustrate that the CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 and CSTF with sparse d1 are more effective and efficient than CSCF and CSTF by comparing the expected test lengths and the values of standard deviation. The optimal parameters of each model can be achieved easily by applying these programs.Suppose an experimenter carries out a demonstration test to select the equipment which satisfies the acceptance criteria. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show the quantities related to the determination of a good CSCF and a good CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 start-up demonstration test for various choices of paand prgiven α = 0.10, β = 0.10, α = 0.05, β = 0.15and α = 0.15, β = 0.15 respectively.Compared to CSCF model, the expected test lengths of CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 are always smaller than that of CSCF. Also, a large reduction in the value of the standard deviation is always achieved, sometimes nearly a 50 percent reduction compared to the value using the CSCF procedure.For CSTF and CSTF with sparse d1, the quantities related to the determination of a good CSTF and a good CSTF with sparse d1 start-up demonstration test are indicated in Table 4.No matter what models the tests based on, the expected test length decreases with the increase of paand decrease of pr. From Table 4, the expected test lengths and the standard deviations of CSTF with sparse d1 are often smaller than that of CSTF test which shows that CSTF with sparse d1 is more efficient and effective than CSTF test.To illustrate the efficiency of these new models more clearly, we can computeP(LCSCF−d3−d4≤LCSCF)through the following formula:(10)P(X≤Y)=∑yP(X≤y)P(Y=y)=∑yFX(y)P(Y=y).where X and Y represent the lengths of these different start-up demonstration tests.For example, when p = pa= 0.99, pr= 0.90, α = 0.10, β = 0.10, and the optimal parameters values of CSCF, CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 can be obtained easily from Table 1. Based on this, we can get the probabilities as below:P(LCSCF−d3−d4≤LCSCF)=0.9976Obviously, the probability that the test length of CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 is less than that of CSCF and the probability is 0.9976 which is very high. That is to say, most of the time, the test length of CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 is lower than that of CSCF. In conclusion, CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 outweighs the CSCF model from this comparison.In addition, we also compare the test length distributions for CSCF with sparse d3 and d4, CSCF and TSTF model when p = pa= 0.95, pr= 0.75, α = 0.05, β = 0.15 and for CSCF with sparse d3 and d4, d3 = 0, d4 = 3, kC= 11, fC = 3; for CSCF test, kC = 12, fC = 2; for TSTF test, kT = 20, fT = 4.From Fig. 7, we can see thatP(LCSCF−d3−d4≤19)>P(LCSCF≤19)>P(LTSTF≤19), which means that the probability that CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 will be terminated with 19 or less test length is greater than that of CSCF and TSTF. That is to say, the probability that CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 will be terminated with a lower test length is always greater than that of other tests. It is manifest to see that start-up demonstration tests with sparse connection are good choices when the experimenters pursue a lower test length.Furthermore, we also compare the test lengths of new start-up demonstration tests with that of traditional ones. Table 5shows 18 cases and Table 6presents 4 cases which are different combinations of pa, pr, α and β. Based on Table 5, Fig. 8can be achieved to compare the test lengths of CSCF, TSTF and CSCF with sparse d3 and d4. Similarly, we can obtain Fig. 9 to give a comparison of CSTF, TSTF and CSTF with sparse d1 based on Table 6.From Fig. 8, it is clear that the test lengths of CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 are always less than that of CSCF and TSTF model in these 18 cases. In conclusion, CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 is more efficient and effective than CSCF and TSTF model.From Fig. 9, we can still see that the test lengths of CSTF with sparse d1 are often smaller than that of CSTF and TSTF models although the advantage of CSTF with sparse d1 is not as obvious as that of CSCF with sparse d3 and d4 when they compare with corresponding traditional models.
