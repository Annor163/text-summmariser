A protocol for reference corpus development has been designed.De-identification tools can be adapted to a new corpus with limited custom data.Better pre-annotations increase reference quality but require more revision time.Clinical document de-identification for French achieves state-of-the-art performance.

BackgroundTo facilitate research applying Natural Language Processing to clinical documents, tools and resources are needed for the automatic de-identification of Electronic Health Records.ObjectiveThis study investigates methods for developing a high-quality reference corpus for the de-identification of clinical documents in French.MethodsA corpus comprising a variety of clinical document types covering several medical specialties was pre-processed with two automatic de-identification systems from the MEDINA suite of tools: a rule-based system and a system using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The pre-annotated documents were revised by two human annotators trained to mark ten categories of Protected Health Information (PHI). The human annotators worked independently and were blind to the system that produced the pre-annotations they were revising.The best pre-annotation system was applied to another random selection of 100 documents.After revision by one annotator, this set was used to train a statistical de-identification system.ResultsTwo gold standard sets of 100 documents were created based on the consensus of two human revisions of the automatic pre-annotations.The annotation experiment showed that (i) automatic pre-annotation obtained with the rule-based system performed better (F=0.813) than the CRF system (F=0.519), (ii) the human annotators spent more time revising the pre-annotations obtained with the rule-based system (from 102 to 160minutes for 50 documents), compared to the CRF system (from 93 to 142minutes for 50 documents), (iii) the quality of human annotation is higher when pre-annotations are obtained with the rule-based system (F-measure ranging from 0.970 to 0.987), compared to the CRF system (F-measure ranging from 0.914 to 0.981).Finally, only 20 documents from the training set were needed for the statistical system to outperform the pre-annotation systems that were trained on corpora from a medical speciality and hospital different from those in the reference corpus developed herein.ConclusionWe find that better pre-annotations increase the quality of the reference corpus but require more revision time. A statistical de-identification method outperforms our rule-based system when as little as 20 custom training documents are available.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Medical knowledge is routinely advanced through clinical studies involving patient volunteers who provide informed consent to participate in a carefully designed study, planned before any medical information is collected or any health care procedure is performed. Medical knowledge can also be greatly advanced through retrospective studies exploiting the wealth of information contained in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This type of study also requires the patients involved to provide informed consent. However, because the study design is crafted after the patients have received the care described in the EHRs, it can be difficult to obtain consent from each patient (e.g., logistics issues arise for contacting the patients or their family).De-identification is the process of hiding or removing content that explicitly identifies persons involved in patient care, including patients themselves and health care providers [1]. The use of de-identified clinical data provides researchers with the means to carry out studies that can advance the state of medical knowledge while protecting patientsâ€™ privacy and confidentiality. Specifically, in the absence of informed consent, the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) contained in clinical data must be processed according to privacy rules and regulations.A significant body of research has addressed the issue of de-identification in the past decades, covering different types of data, such as text, images, biological samples and DNA sequences [2]. In this paper, we focus on the de-identification of clinical free-text, as a preliminary step to prepare clinical text for further Natural Language Processing (NLP) and analysis of clinical documents. In order to ensure the quality and robustness of NLP tools, real clinical data must be used for development and testing.An increasing number of efforts recently targeted the de-identification of clinical text in English [3]. Other efforts also addressed the de-identification of clinical documents in languages other than English such as French [4,5] and Swedish [6,7]. The lack of a freely available de-identification reference corpus similar to the i2b2 corpus available for English [8] has prevented any rigorous comparison between the two approaches developed for French.Our goal is to support research in Natural Language Processing for biomedical texts in French through the development of a de-identified corpus that can be distributed to the scientific community for research purposes [9].In this paper, we focus on three specific aims that address both fundamental research questions and practical considerations:1.De-identification research methods for clinical texts in French: what are the best methods for automatic text de-identification in French? What are the best methods for producing a reliable, high-quality reference corpus for de-identification? Specifically, we assess the usability of two automatic pre-annotation methods.De-identification resources: development of a de-identification reference corpus freely available to the scientific community.De-identification evaluation: assess the time and effort required to produce de-identified corpora and adapt existing de-identification tools to new, unseen data.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we presented several experiments on the de-identification of French clinical notes in order to design a protocol to build a reference corpus optimizing time, annotation quality and annotator experience. We worked sequentially with three sets of 100 documents randomly selected from a group of French hospital. The documents were partially de-identified for the most sensitive data (i.e., first name, last name and date of birth of patients).First, we used two distinct de-identification systems designed to process clinical notes in French from a cardiology ward: a rule-based system and a statistical system (that relies on the CRF formalism). Then, we compared two CRF models: an out-of-domain model, that has been built on data from another hospital in another medical domain, vs. an in-domain model, built on the result of the human annotation process we designed.During all experiments, two human annotators revised the result of automatic pre-annotation obtained either from the rule-based system or the machine-learning approach. We computed annotation time as well as inter- and intra-annotator agreement to assess the support provided by the pre-annotations.In this study, we found that the rule-based system provided better annotation quality compared to the CRF model, when both systems are trained on outside data. We also found that a CRF model built on in-domain data outperformed all other methods. We showed that human annotators worked faster with the pre-annotations obtained from a CRF approach, compared to a rule-based system, even if the CRF-based annotation quality was worse.This study contributes to research in de-identification by providing unique data on French. It also contributes to research in corpus annotation and reference corpus development by providing insight on how to use available pre-annotation methods to optimize annotation time, annotation quality and annotator experience.
