@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A method to construct arbitrary order continuous curves, which pass through a given set of data points, is introduced. The method can derive a new family of symmetric interpolating splines with various nice properties, such as partition of unity, interpolation property, local support and second order precision etc. Applying these new splines to construct curves and surfaces, one can adjust the shape of the constructed curve and surface locally by moving some interpolating points or by inserting new interpolating points. Constructing closed smooth curves and surfaces and smooth joining curves and surfaces also become very simple, in particular, for constructingCr(r⩾1)continuous closed surfaces by using the repeating technique. These operations mentioned do not require one to solve a system of equations. The resulting curves or surfaces are directly expressed by the basis spline functions. Furthermore, the method can also directly produce control points of the interpolating piecewise Bézier curves or tensor product Bézier surfaces by using matrix formulas. Some examples are given to support the conclusions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Polynomial curve interpolation is a theoretical cornerstone of CAGD. There have existed many methods such as Lagrange interpolation and Hermite interpolation etc. (Farin, 2002). However, polynomial interpolants may oscillate when the degree of the polynomial gets higher. The methods do not provide the opportunity for local shape control which is very important in CAGD. Maybe using low degree piecewise polynomials including cubic splines is a good compromise for most applications (Faux and Pratt, 1979). Catmull–Rom splines (Catmull and Rom, 1974), which are also piecewise polynomials, are defined to pass exactly through all the control points. The commonly used curves including Bézier curves and B-spline curves, with many nice properties, do not pass through all their control points. In order to find these curves interpolating a set of given points, one needs to solve a system of equations to inversely compute the control points.Nowadays, non-polynomial curve interpolation methods have been developed. After Catmull and Clark (1978), Doo and Sabin (1978) proposed approximating subdivision schemes, the methods have attracted many researchersʼ attention (Loop, 1987; Zorin et al., 1996 etc.). Various interpolatory subdivision schemes were developed by Dyn et al. (1987), Hassan et al. (2002), Beccari et al. (2013) etc. for curve design. Subdivision schemes are easy to use and have many nice properties, in particular, for constructing subdivision surfaces with arbitrary topology meshes. However, a limitation in connection with such interpolatory subdivision schemes lies in that their limit curves cannot be explicitly expressed by the known mathematical functions. It is also difficult to construct interpolatory subdivision curves and surfaces with high order continuity. The reason is that the basis function of the interpolatory subdivision scheme does not have the mathematical function expression, even if it exists.Many other subdivision methods (Labsik and Greiner, 2000; Li and Ma, 2007; Lin et al., 2008 and references therein) also do not have the basis functions with the mathematical expressions. It is difficult to determine whether a point lies on the subdivision surface. Therefor, a few researchers have proposed some evaluation algorithms (Stam, 1998; Schaefer and Warren, 2008). One can also find other interpolation methods based on meshless approaches using radial basis functions (Wang and Liu, 2002). Some researchers used rational Gaussian (R&G) functions for constructing curves and surfaces (Goshtasby, 2003, 1995) including approximate circles and spheres with high accuracy. Using these methods, one still needs to solve a system of linear equations in order to compute the control points. Recently, Zhang and Ma (2011) gave an interpolation method which can avoid to solve equations based on the following observation.Letϕ(t)denote the basis function of the 4-point interpolatory subdivision scheme or of the interpolatory 4-pointC2ternary subdivision scheme. Then for a given set of data points byPi∈Rd, for dimensiond⩾1, the subdivision interpolatory curve can be rewritten as(1)P(t)=∑−∞+∞Piϕ(t−i):=∑−∞+∞Piϕi(t).Based on the subdivision rules, we sum up the basisϕi(t)which satisfy the following properties.(1.1)Symmetry.ϕ(t)(=ϕ0(t))is an even function (see Fig. 1), so the graph is symmetric about the ordinate axis.Translation invariance. That is,ϕi(t)=ϕ(t−i).ϕ(t)is at leastC1continuous.Local support. There exists an integer T, outside the interval[−T,T], such that|ϕ(t)|=0.Partition of unity (POU). That is∑iϕ(t−i)=1.Reproducing the straight liney=t. That is∑iiϕ(t−i)=t.Properties (1.5) and (1.6) form the linear precision of the basis functions.Cardinal property. That isϕi(j)={1;i=j,0;i≠j.The functions satisfying the above properties are called “symmetric interpolation splines” in this paper. Most interpolation methods (see Farin et al., 2002; Cohen et al., 2001) including Shepard methods and radial basis function methods (Shepard, 1968; Wang and Liu, 2002) do not enjoy all the properties mentioned. The following basis functions (see Fig. 1) (Zhang and Ma, 2011)(2)ϕ(t,a)=sinc(t)e−at2:={sin(πt)πte−at2,t≠0;1,t=0,satisfy properties (1.1), (1.2) and (1.7), however, only hold under a small tolerance for other properties (1.3), (1.4), (1.5) and (1.6). Although the basis function in Eq. (2) can produce straight lines and higher precision circles, various interpolation curves and surfaces etc., it does not satisfy exactly the above properties. This disadvantage may confine the use of the basis function in some strict design.The main goal of this paper is to construct interpolation basis functions which satisfy properties (1.1)–(1.7) listed before. We first propose a novel method to construct an interpolation smooth curve passing through a given set of data points. Based on the method, a new family of spline functions with all properties mentioned above is derived. Furthermore, we find that the method of using new spline functions to construct curves or surfaces can be converted into directly inserting Bézier control points into every two adjacent original points for curves or every four adjacent original points for surfaces. the continuous order of the curves and surfaces constructed only depends on the chosen basis spline. It is a very difficult problem constructing a closed surface to pass through the given points withC2continuity (Peters and Reif, 2004). However, by using the basis function proposed in this paper, we can easily obtainCn(n⩾2)continuous closed surfaces by applying the repeating technique (see Section 4.1). In particular, it does not require one to solve a system of equations.The classical Hermite interpolation, which interpolates the given points and the given various derivatives at the points. This construction is one of the most common interpolating technique in computer graphics and computer aided design (Goldman, 2003; Faux and Pratt, 1979) etc. Here we give a new method also with the aid of Hermite polynomials. The key point lies in the choice of the derivatives at the interpolating points. The derivatives in this paper are taken from the intrinsic factor of the data points themselves. Suppose a given set of data pointsPiare evenly taken from a smooth curve, we wish to reconstruct it. It is a natural idea to estimate the derivative at the pointPiby the differencePi+1−PiorPi−Pi−1, and more rational estimate may be their average. This idea can be extended to higher order derivatives. Furthermore, it is also considered to use more neighboring points for further estimating the derivatives. Based on the above idea, the detailed procedure is as follows:(i) Define the various order derivatives. For convenience, we introduce the shifting (translation) operator E and identity operator I as follows:EPi=Pi+1andIPi=Pi, then let(3)ki(r)={(E−I)rPi−r2;ris even,12((E−I)rPi−r−12+(E−I)rPi−r+12);ris odd.It is easy to see thatki(r)is actually some differences about the interpolation points. For example,ki(r)={Pi+1−2Pi+Pi−1;r=2,12(Pi+1−Pi−1);r=1.It is also easy to observe that the expression ofki(r)is symmetric about the subscript ofPi.(ii) Further estimate derivatives. Letαj,rare some parameters will be chosen later. Then the r-th order derivativedi(r)at pointPiis defined as:(4)di(r)=∑j=−s(r)s(r)αj,rki+j(r),wheres(r)is a positive integer may be chosen varying with r, and free parametersαj,rshould satisfy constraints(5)∑j=−s(r)s(r)αj,r=1,αj,r=α−j,r.(iii) Using the control (interpolating) pointsPiand the various order derivatives given by Eq. (4), we can construct a unique Hermite piecewise polynomialsP(t)with degree not larger than2r+1. For simplicity, we giveP(t)over the intervalt∈[0,1]instead of the intervalt∈[i,i+1]with the following cardinal form:(6)Pi(t)=PiH02r+1(t)+di(1)H12r+1(t)+⋯+di(r)Hr2r+1(t)+di+1(r)Hr+12r+1(t)+di+1(r−1)Hr+22r+1(t)+⋯+Pi+1H2r+12r+1(t),whereHj2r+1(t)satisfyddtiHj(0)=δi,j,i=0,1,…,r;j=0,1,…,r,andddtiHj(1)=δi,2r+1−j,i=0,1,…,r;j=r+1,r+2,…,2r+1.Note:(a) Conditions (5) can assume that the constructed curve with symmetry about the pointPiif the set of pointsPiis symmetric aboutPi. This is a natural and rational requirement.(b) IfPiis a set of data with dimension larger than 1, thendi(r)can be viewed as a derivative vector. In the later, ifPiis a set of data with dimension one, we denote it byyi.The above method to construct curves has the following properties.(2.1) The constructed curveP(t)is an interpolatory curve which exactly passes through all the given points, and is symmetric about the pointPiif the set of pointsPiis symmetric about the pointPi.(2.2) The curveP(t)is at leastCrcontinuous. According to the construction procedure, Properties (1) and (2) are obvious.(2.3) Local shape adjustable. If we move one pointPi, the curve only changes its shape which lies betweenPi−TandPi+Tlocally. Where(7)T={maxr(r2+s(r)+1),ris even;maxr(r+12+s(r)+1),ris odd.It is easily observed from Eq. (4) that moving the pointPionly changesdi−T+1(j),…,di(j),…,di+T−1(j),j=1,2,…,r, so the conclusion is valid.We now introduce the symbol{Pi}={…,Pi−1,Pi,Pi+1,…}, which denotes a given set of points, and then define the addition of the two sets of{Pi1}={…,Pi−11,Pi1,Pi+11,…}and{Pi2}={…,Pi−12,Pi2,Pi+12,…}as{Pi1}+{Pi2}={…,Pi−11+Pi−12,Pi1+Pi2,Pi+11+Pi+12,…}.(2.4) Additivity. If we construct two curvesP1(t)andP2(t)by the method above from the two sets of data points{Pi1}and{Pi2}respectively, thenP1(t)+P2(t)is the curve passing through the set of data points{Pi1}+{Pi2}.ProofLetdi,1(r)anddi,2(r), which defined by Eq. (4), refer to the set of pointsPi1andPi2respectively.di(r)refer to the set of pointsPi1+Pi2. It is easy to see thatdi(r)=di,1(r)+di,2(r).Then the conclusion derives from Eq. (6).(2.5) IfP(t)is a curve passing through a set of{Pi}, thenc⋅P(t)is a curve passing through a set ofc⋅{Pi}, where c is a constant.Notice thatdi(r)is a linear combination of{Pi}, by Eq. (6), the conclusion is obvious.(2.6) Second order precision. If the set of data pointsPiis evenly taken from the straight liney=xor the parabolic liney=x2, then the curveP(t)reproduces the curve ifr⩾2in the method. Notingdi(1)=constantforPi=i, anddi(1)=2ianddi(2)=2forPi=i2. So the parabolic line can be reproduced exactly. The cubic curvey=x3can only be approximately reconstructed because its various order derivatives do not be estimated exactly. Fig. 2shows these results.Applying the formula of transforming Hermite polynomials to Bernstein basis (Chang, 1984)(8)Hk2r+1(t)=(2r+1−k)!(2r+1)!∑i=krBi2r+1(t)(ik),k=0,1,…,rand(9)Hk2r+1(t)=(−1)k+1k!(2r+1)!∑i=2r+1−krB2r+1−i2r+1(t)(i2r+1−k),k=r+1,r+2,…,2r+1,whereBin(t)=(ni)(1−t)n−itiare Bernstein basis functions. We can rewrite curve equation (6) as in the Bézier form. For later use, we only give two formulas in the matrix form according to Eqs. (8) and (9) forr=1andr=2, respectively:(10)(H03H13H23H33)=(11000130000−1300011)(B03B13B23B33)and(11)(H05H15H25H35H45H55)=(111000015250000012000000012000000−25−150000111)(B05B15B25B35B45B55).Let us now begin to construct new splines or new basis. Applying the above method to the set of data points{yi}withyi=1andyj=0for all j excepti=j, that is, let{yi}:=ei:={…,0,1,0,…}, we obtain degree2r+1piecewise polynomialsφi(t)with the parametersαj,l,l=0,1,…,r. By the procedure of the construction, it is easy to see that the translation functionφ(t−i)ofφ(t)(=φ0(t))is identical toφi(t). The polynomial curveφ(t)and its translation functions may be regarded as a new family of interpolation splines. They satisfy all the properties mentioned in Section 1. We restate two of these. First, Local support. Outside the interval[−T,T], we haveφ(t)=0, where T is defined by Eq. (7). The reason is that all piecewise polynomials ofφ(t)=0out the interval[−T,T]being zero since all interpolatory points and their various order derivatives are all zero. Second, Linear precision, furthermore, with second order precision for the splines withr⩾2. That is∑i=−T+1N+T−1ijφ(t−i)=tj,t∈[0,N−1],j=0,1,2.In addition, it is easy to see that every spline function in the family of splines and its translation functions form a basis which is linearly independent and non-degenerate.Noting that{Pi}=∑iPieiand additivity property (4) and property (5) of the method, we can write the interpolatory curve passing through a set of data pointsPi∈Rd,i=0,1,…,N−1, as follows:(12)P(t)=∑i=0N−1Piφ(t−i):=∑i=0N−1Piφi(t).In the practical application to construct a smooth interpolating curve, it is more efficient to use a piecewise polynomial basis function with lower degree, higher order continuity and smaller support. Letφj,k,T(t)denote the piecewise polynomials with degree j, continuous order k and half support T. In what follows, we will provide a family of spline basis according to the order of continuity, meanwhile, a few optimal splines are provided according to the above criterion.Applying the conversion formula (10) to Eq. (6), we can derive a family of cubic interpolation splines in Bézier form:(13)y(t)=yiB03(t−i)+(yi+13di(1))B13(t−i)+(yi+1−13di+1(1))B23(t−i)+yi+1B33(t−i),t∈[i,i+1].Now, lettingy0=1andyi=0for all i excepti=0ands(1)=1in Eq. (4) (note that ifs(1)is assigned another positive integer, we will obtain another family of splines), we obtaindi(1)anddi+1(1)through Eq. (4). Then we obtain a family of splines as follows:(14)φ3(t)={12a1(t+2)+a1(t+2)2+12a1(t+2)3;−3⩽t<−2,12a0(t+1)+(a0+12a1)(t+1)2+12(a1+a0)(t+1)3;−2⩽t<−1,1+(−3+12a0)t2+(12a0−2)t3;−1⩽t<0,1+(−3+12a0)t2+(−12a0+2)t3;0⩽t<1,−12a0(t−1)+(a0+12a1)(t−1)2−12(a1+a0)(t−1)3;1⩽t<2,12a1(t−2)+a1(t−2)2−12a1(t−2)3;2⩽t<3,0;otherwisewith two free parametersa0anda1, for convenience, where we have leta0=α0,1,a1=α1,1satisfying the constraints (5). Furthermore, leta0=1,a1=0in the above expression, then we obtain the well-known cubic Catmull–Rom spline (Catmull and Rom, 1974):(15)φ3,1,2(t)={2+4t+52t2+12t3;−2⩽t<−1,1−52t2−32t3;−1⩽t<0,1−52t2+32t3;0⩽t<1,2−4t+52t2−12t3;1⩽t<2,0;otherwise.This is a unique spline with degree 3,c1continuity and half support 2. Also, it is more convenient to obtain the above spline through Eq. (13) by the following formi⋯−2−1012⋯yi⋯00100⋯di(1)⋯0120−120⋯.Furthermore, leta1=−15,a0=75in Eq. (14), then we get a new spline:(16)φ3,1,3(t)={−95−2110t−45t2−110t3;−3⩽t<−2,135+5110t+3110t2+35t3;−2⩽t<−1,1−2310t2−1310t3;−1⩽t<0,1−2310t2+1310t3;0⩽t<1,135−5110t+3110t2−35t3;1⩽t<2,−95+2110t−45t2+110t3;2⩽t<3,0;otherwise,which also can be obtained through Eq. (13) and the following formi⋯−3−2−10123⋯yi⋯0001000⋯di(1)⋯0−1107100−7101100⋯.The graph of the spline are shown in Fig. 3. This spline function enjoys a merit. We can reconstruct a unit circle with higher precision. Its radius falls within the interval[0.9995,1.0000]when using eight even points on the unit circle. Comparison for using the Catmull–Rom spline to do so, the radius of the unit reconstructed is within the interval[0.9915,1.0000](Fig. 4upper left). The graphs of the reconstructing circle and the standard circle are both shown in Fig. 4 (upper right) for comparison. Some more exact circles and spheres were constructed by using rational Gaussian method (Goshtasby 1995, 2003) through very complicated computation.It needs to be pointed out that if we takes(1)=2or even larger indi(1)(see Eq. (4)), then the support of the corresponding spline will be getting larger. But the spline still remains theC1continuity. In the view of the application, we should take lesss(1), so doess(i)(i⩾2)in the other higher order splines.Applying the convention formula (11) to Eq. (6), we can derive a family of quintic Hermite interpolation polynomial in Bézier form:(17)y(t)=yiB05(t−i)+(yi+15di(1))B15(t−i)+(yi+25di(1)+120di(2))B25(t−i)+(yi+1−25di+1(1)+120di+1(2))B35(t−i)+(yi+1−15di+1(1))B45(t−i)+yi+1B55(t−i),t∈[i,i+1].Now, lettingy0=1andyi=0for all i excepti=0ands(1)=s(2)=1in Eq. (4) (note that ifs(1)ors(2)is assigned another positive integer, we will obtain another family of splines) we obtain a family of splines as follows:(18)φ5(t)={12α1(t+2)−12α2(t−2)2+(3α1−32α2)×(t+2)3−(4α1−32α2)(t+2)4−(32α1−12α2)(t+2)5;−3⩽t<−2,12β1(t+1)+(12β2−α2)(t+1)2−(3β1−32β2+72α2+2α1)(t+1)3+(−72α1−4β1+32β2−4α2)(t−1)4−(32α2−12β2+32α1+32β1)(t+1)5;−2⩽t<−1,1+(α2−β2)t2−(−10−4α2+72β2+2β1)t3+(−72β1+5α2−4β2+15)t4−(32β2−2α2+32β1−6)t5;−1⩽t<0,1+(α2−β2)t2+(−10−4α2+72β2+2β1)t3+(−72β1+5α2−4β2+15)t4+(32β2−2α2+32β1−6)t5;0⩽t<1,−12β1(t−1)+(12β2−α2)(t−1)2+(3β1−32β2+72α2+2α1)(t−1)3+(−72α1−4β1+32β2−4α2)(t−1)4+(32α2−12β2+32α1+32β1)(t−1)5;1⩽t<2,−12α1(t−2)+12α2(t−2)2+(3α1−32α2)×(t−2)3+(−4α1+32α2)(t−2)4+(−12α2+32α1)(t−2)5;2⩽t<3,0;otherwise,where we have letα1=a1,1,β1=a0,1,α2=a1,2,β2=a0,2. Furthermore, letα1=−15,β1=75andα2=−17,β2=97satisfy constraints (5), then we have(19)φ5,2,3(t)={1357+288970t+242170t2+19914t3+21070t4+835t5;−3⩽t<−2,−11335−113170t−190170t2−1025t3−24935t4−3335t5;−2⩽t<−1,1−107t2+14970t3+29770t4+5935t5;−1⩽t<0,1−107t2−14970t3+29770t4−5935t5;0⩽t<1,−11335+113170t−190170t2+1025t3−24935t4+3335t5;1⩽t<2,1357−288970t+242170t2−19914t3+21070t4−835t5;2⩽t<3,0;otherwise.Also, it can be obtained through Eq. (17) and the following form:i⋯−3−2−10123⋯yi⋯0001000⋯di(1)⋯0−1107100−7101100⋯di(2)⋯0−17117−207117−170⋯.This spline function enjoys a merit. We can reconstruct a unit circle with higher precision. Its radius falls within the interval[0.99995,1.00002]when using eight even points on the unit circle. The graph of the reconstructing circle and the standard circle are shown in Fig. 4 for comparison.From the construction procedure of the spline functions, it seems that at least2r+1degree piecewise polynomial splines can attainCrcontinuous. However, this is not right. We now give a unique piecewise polynomial spline of degree 4 withC2continuous and with half support 3, and later we will give a degree 6 spline withC3continuous and with half support 3.Let all the coefficients of the teamst5in Eq. (18) be zero, we obtain a system of equations:{32β2−2α2+32β1−6=0,32α2−12β2+32α1+32β1=0,−12α2+32α1=0and combining with constraints (5){2α1+β1=1,2α2+β2=1.The above two systems of equations have a set of unique solutions (parameter values):(20){α1=−16,β1=43,α2=−12,β2=2.Thus, we easily obtain the spline of degree 4 corresponding to the parameter values above:(21)φ4,2,3(t)={−92−274t−154t2−1112t3−112t4;−3⩽t<−2,72+9512t+254t2+2512t3+14t4;−2⩽t<−1,1−52t2−53t3−16t4;−1⩽t<0,1−52t2+53t3−16t4;0⩽t<1,72−9512t+254t2−2512t3+14t4;1⩽t<2,−92+274t−154t2+1112t3−112t4;2⩽t<3,0;otherwise.Letα1=0,α2=0,β1=1,β2=1in Eq. (18), then we obtain(22)φ5,2,2(t)={−4−18t−29t2−432t3−152t4−t5;−2⩽t<−1,1−t2+92t3+152t4+3t5;−1⩽t<0,1−t2−92t3+152t4−3t5;0⩽t<1,−4+18t−29t2+432t3−152t4+t5;1⩽t<2,0;otherwise,which is a unique spline with degree 5,C2continuity and half support 2.According to the previous discussion, we can obtain arbitrary order continuous splines. To save space, and also considering that the application for the splines with continuous order larger than 3 is rare, we only provide the following two splines:(23)φ6,3,3(t)={1354+1712t+141316t2+1914t3+34324t4+94t5+748t6;−3⩽t<−2,−94−956t−53916t2−39512t3−1338t4−174t5−716t6;−2⩽t<−1,1−178t2+73t4+32t5+724t6;−1⩽t<0,1−178t2+73t4−32t5+724t6;0⩽t<1,−94+956t−53916t2+39512t3−1338t4+174t5−716t6;1⩽t<2,1354−1712t+141316t2−1914t3+34324t4−94t5+748t6;2⩽t<3,0;otherwise,and(24)φ7,3,3(t)={−54−153t−3692t2−4914t3−1463t4−232t5−32t6−112t7;−3⩽t<−2,34+5333t+7912t2+19254t3+6872t4+2872t5+652t6+3712t7;−2⩽t<−1,1−t2−896t4−37t5−31t6−536t7;−1⩽t<0,1−t2−896t4+37t5−31t6+536t7;0⩽t<1,34−5333t+7912t2−19254t3+6872t4−2872t5+652t6−3712t7;1⩽t<2,−54+153t−3692t2+4914t3−1463t4+232t5−32t6+112t7;2⩽t<3,0;otherwise.By a similar computation as in Section 3.3, it is easy to see thatφ6,3,3(t)is unique, andφ7,3,3(t)is not unique. That is, the spline with degree 6, continuous order 3 and half support 3 is unique, and the splines with degreej⩾7, continuous orderk⩾3and half supportT⩾3is not unique.Suppose given N pointsPi∈Rd,i=0,1,…,N−1with endpointsP0andPN−1, we usually need a few auxiliary points at the two sides of the endpoints. The curve equation (12) can be written as(25)P(t)=∑i=−rN+r−1Piφ(t−i),t∈[0,N−1]wherePi,i=−r,…,−1andi=N,…,N+r−1are auxiliary points, r is a positive integer not larger than the order of the continuity. We usually taker=1, 2 or 3 in this paper. Notice that the parameter domain is stillt∈[0,N−1]. The auxiliary points can be used for adjusting the shape of the curve near the endpoints or for satisfying the forced conditions at the endpoints. The continuity of the curve constructed depends only on the chosen spline. We have reconstructed some free curves by using the splinesφ5,2,3(t)(Eq. (13)). Fig. 5shows some results. A designer can adjust the shape of the curve locally by moving a control (interpolatory) point or inserting constraint points (Fig. 5 (lower row)). Smoothly joining two curves is also very convenient. All operations mentioned do not make any extra computation. For detailed description of these procedures refer to our previous work (Zhang and Ma, 2011; Zhang, 2012).In order to make Eq. (25) denote a closed smooth curve with arbitrary order continuity, we just repeat a few given points (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). For example, suppose the basis spline isCrcontinuous with half support r, to that aim, except for the necessary conditionP0=PN−1we need to repeat the r given points at the two sides respectively. Taker=2as an example, namely, we have to letP−1=PN−2,P−2=PN−3andP1=PN,P2=PN+1as the forced conditions. In this case, the curve (25) isC2continuous at the meeting pointP0(PN−1)Since the first and second derivatives at the meeting pointP0(orPN−1) ared0(1)andd0(2), respectively, according to the forced conditions. For detailed example, we took 24 points from the contour line of an apple to reconstruct the curve. To guarantee that the curve hasC2continuity at the meeting point, we added two auxiliary points at the two sides of the meeting point, respectively. Fig. 6 (left) shows the result. The amplified Fig. 6 (right) shows the result at the meeting point(0.8,7.65). In addition, the basis functions can create segment straight lines, approximating cusps, and approximating arcs in a curve. Fig. 6 shows the results. The approximating accuracy of the cusps and the arc can be improved by adding and adjusting interpolatory points. Certainly, the exact cusp can be produced if we use two straight segment lines.For surface constructions, by using the following tensor-product basis function:Φ1,2(u,v)=φ1(u)⋅φ2(v),an interpolatory surface that passes through a finite number of gridded data pointsPi,j(xi,j,yi,j,zi,j)(i=0,1,…,m−1;j=0,1,…,n−1)can be written as:(26)P(u,v)=∑i=0m−1∑j=0n−1Pi,jΦ1,2(u−i,v−j)=(φ1(u−0),φ1(u−1),…,φ1(u−m+1))Am×n(φ2(u−0),φ2(u−1),…,φ2(u−m+1))TwhereAm×n=(Pi,j)m×nis a matrix containing the array of control points, and the two splinesφ1andφ2can be taken as the same or not. Similar to the case of the curve, a smooth surface with arbitrary order continuity can be constructed through repeating points. As per the method in the paper of Zhang (2012), we approximately reconstructed an appleʼs surface using 90 data points directly sampled on the appleʼs surface. The results are shown in Fig. 7. For comparison, we reconstructed an approximate unit sphere using the same basis functionφ5,2,3to replaceφ1(u)andφ2(v)in Eq. (26). The radius of the reconstructed sphere falls within the interval[0.99995,1.00007]. The average error of the radius is less than 0.00002. Compared with that of using the basis functions in Zhang and Ma (2011), the accuracy of using the current basis to reconstruct the circle and the sphere is greatly improved. The two closed surfaces mentioned areC2continuous since the basis function used isφ5,2,3which isC2continuous. If using aC3continuous basis for exampleφ6,3,3instead ofφ5,2,3, then one will obtainC3continuous closed surfaces.We have reconstructed the surface of the functionz=exp(cos(1−x2−y2))in the square domain[−1.2,1.2]×[−1.2,1.2]by using the spline functionφ4,2,3(Eq. (20)). For reconstructing the surface, we have taken the interpolating points as follows. Dividing each edge of the square domain[−1.6,1.6]×[−1.6,1.6]into 16 pieces evenly, we obtain 289 gridded points which produce 289 interpolating points. Some of them (120 points) outside the square domain[−1.2,1.2]×[−1.2,1.2]are the auxiliary points. Obviously, here the sampling pace is 0.2 units. The maximum error and the average error between the normal and the reconstructed surface are about7.2×10−3and1.7×10−3, respectively. Fig. 8shows the approximate result. If the sampling pace is decreased to 0.1, then the corresponding maximum error and the average error above are about4.9×10−4and1.0×10−4. If using the spline functionφ5,2,3(Eq. (19)) and taking the pace 0.2, then the corresponding maximum error and the average error above are about2.2×10−3and6.9×10−4, respectively. If the pace is decreasing to 0.1, then the corresponding maximum error and the average error above are about2.0×10−4and5.7×10−5, respectively. These error data show that the approximating result of using the splineφ5,2,3is better than that of using the splineφ4,2,3.The constructed curves by splines can be changed into the piecewise Bézier curves. For examples, if we choose the splineφ4,2,3(t), then a segment curve constructed can be written as:Pi(t)=∑j=−23Pi+jφ4,2,3(t−i−j),t∈[0,1].Inserting the parameter values (20) into Eq. (4) and then through Eq. (17), we can rewrite the conversion formula (Eq. (17)) as the following Bézier form (notice that we have changedyiandyi(t)in Eq. (17) intoPiandPi(t), respectively)(27)Pi(t)=∑j=05P¯i,jBj5(t)whereP¯i,0=Pi,P¯i,5=Pi+1and(28){P¯i,1=−160Pi+2+215Pi+1+Pi−215Pi−1+160Pi−2,P¯i,2=−7120Pi+2+512Pi+1+34Pi−760Pi−1+1120Pi−2,P¯i,3=1120Pi+3−760Pi+2+34Pi+1+512Pi−7120Pi−1,P¯i,4=160Pi+3−215Pi+2+Pi+1+215Pi−160Pi−1.It is not difficult to rewrite (27) as(29)Pi(t)=∑j=04Pi,jBj4(t)by degree reduction one, wherePi,0=Pi,Pi,4=Pi+1and(30){Pi,1=−148Pi+2+16Pi+1+Pi−16Pi−1+148Pi−2,Pi,2=−112Pi+2+712Pi+1+712Pi−112Pi−1,Pi,3=148Pi+3−16Pi+2+Pi+1+16Pi−148Pi−1,or write it as in the matrix form:(31)(Pi,0Pi,1Pi,2Pi,3Pi,4)=(001000148−16116−14800−112712712−11200−148161−16148000100)(Pi−2Pi−1PiPi+1Pi+2Pi+3).Thus, we obtain a very simple algorithm for constructingC2interpolating curve as follows:Given a set of points…,Pi−2,Pi−1,Pi,Pi+1,Pi+2,…,then directly insert 3 Bézier control points by using the linear formula (30) in every two adjacent pointsPiandPi+1:…,Pi−2,Pi−1(=Pi−1,0),Pi−1,1,Pi−1,2,Pi−1,3,(Pi−1,4=)Pi(=Pi,0),Pi,1,Pi,2,Pi,3,(Pi,4=)Pi+1,Pi+2,….Thus a piecewise Bézier curve withC2continuity in total is finished. Fig. 9(upper left) depicts this algorithm. Note that the difference with the interpolatory subdivision method, the current inserting pointsPi,1,Pi,2,Pi,3are not the interpolatory points, but are Bézier control points.Similarly, if we choose the splineφ5,2,2(t), then a segment curve can be written as:Pi(t)=∑j=−12Pi+jφ5,2,2(t−i−j),t∈[0,1]which can be changed into the following Bézier form through the converting formulaPi(t)=∑j=05Pi,jBj5(t)where the conversion matrix between control or interpolating points is:(32)(Pi,0Pi,1Pi,2Pi,3Pi,4Pi,5)=(0100−11011100−320910140014910−32001101−1100010)(Pi−1PiPi+1Pi+2).The algorithm can be simply expressed as follows:Given a set of points…,Pi−2,Pi−1,Pi,Pi+1,Pi+2,…,then directly insert 4 Bézier control points by using formula (32) in every two adjacent pointsPiandPi+1:…,Pi−2,Pi−1,Pi−1,1,Pi−1,2,Pi−1,3,Pi−1,4,Pi,Pi,1,Pi,2,Pi,3,Pi,4,Pi+1,Pi+2,….Fig. 9 (upper right) depicts this algorithm.ForC3continuity curve, we just list the convention matrix between the control points and inserting Bézier points for the splines (23) and (24), respectively, as follows:(33)(Pi,0Pi,1Pi,2Pi,3Pi,4Pi,5Pi,6)=(001000172−19119−172011720−5361031201136−2972000−34023402340−34000−297201136103120−536117200−172191−19172000100)(Pi−2Pi−1PiPi+1Pi+2Pi+3)and(34)(Pi,0Pi,1Pi,2Pi,3Pi,4Pi,5Pi,6Pi,7)=(0010000−1141114000−54220211600−1420−29210675921014200014205921067−29210−142000162021−5420001141−1140000100)(Pi−2Pi−1PiPi+1Pi+2Pi+3).Fig. 9 (lower left and right) depicts the algorithm respectively.For surface basis conversion, we give an example. Take the two basis (splines)φ1(u)andφ2(v)in Eq. (26) both areφ4,2,3, then we can express a piece of surface as (for simplicity, we have writtenφ4,2,3as φ in the following equation)P(u,v)=∑i=−23∑j=−23Pi,jφ(u−i)φ(v−j)=(φ(u−0),φ(u−1),…,φ(u−5))A6×6(φ(u−0),φ(u−1),…,φ(u−5))T,u∈[0,1],v∈[0,1],which can be converted into Bézier tensor-product form as:(35)P(u,v)=(B04(u),B14(u),B24(u),B34(u),B44(u))B5×5(B04(v),B14(v),B24(v),B34(v),B44(v))T,where matrixB5×5=QAQTand Q is defined by (31). Fig. 10depicts this algorithm.We have compared Akimaʼs interpolation method (Akima, 1970) and 4-pointsC2ternary subdivision method with the current method by using the splineφ5,2,3(see Eq. (19)). All methods use the same data points:x023568911121415y10101010101010.515506085which were taken from in Akimaʼs original paper. Fig. 11shows the results. We have also used some simple points for testing the smoothness of the curves. These results seem to indicate that the Akimaʼs curves are not sufficiently smooth or natural in most cases.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have presented a new method of constructing curves and surfaces passing through a given set of data points. It can derive a new family of symmetric splines with many nice properties. The method for constructing curves and surfaces can be converted into inserting Bézier control points into every two adjacent original points for curves or every four adjacent original points for surfaces though a uniform matrix formula. Hence the algorithm is very simple. The method not only avoids the traditional complexity of solving a system of equations to achieve an interpolatory curve or surface with desired continuity order, but also ensures that the local shapes are adjustable. It resists oscillations or the Runge phenomenon that is common to polynomial interpolation curves and surfaces, and also retains the various operation properties, such as connecting different smooth curves or surfaces easily, and constructing closed curves and surfaces conveniently. We believe that the method will be developed for use in various interpolating curve or surface construction, in particular, for very large data points duo to its simplicity.
