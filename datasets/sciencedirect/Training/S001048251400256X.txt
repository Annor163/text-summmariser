BackgroundNon-invasive tools to help identify patients likely to benefit from catheter ablation (CA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) would facilitate personalised treatment planning.AimTo investigate atrial waveform organisation through recurrence plot indices (RPI) and their ability to predict CA outcome.MethodsOne minute 12-lead ECG was recorded before CA from 62 patients with AF (32 paroxysmal AF; 45 men; age 57±10 years). Organisation of atrial waveforms from i) TQ intervals in V1 and ii) QRST suppressed continuous AF waveforms (CAFW), were quantified using RPI: percentage recurrence (PR), percentage determinism (PD), entropy of recurrence (ER). Ability to predict acute (terminating vs. non-terminating AF), 3-month and 6-month postoperative outcome (AF vs. AF free) were assessed.ResultsRPI either by TQ or CAFW analysis did not change significantly with acute outcome. Patients arrhythmia-free at 6-month follow-up had higher organisation in TQ intervals by PD (p<0.05) and ER (p<0.005) and both were significant predictors of 6-month outcome (PD (AUC=0.67, p<0.05) and ER (AUC=0.72, p<0.005)). For paroxysmal AF cases, all RPI predicted 3-month (AUC(ER)=0.78, p<0.05; AUC(PD)=0.79, p<0.05; AUC(PR)=0.80, p<0.01) and 6-month (AUC(ER)=0.81, p<0.005; AUC(PD)=0.75, p<0.05; AUC(PR)=0.71, p<0.05) outcome. CAFW-derived RPIs did not predict acute or postoperative outcomes.Higher values of any RPI from TQ (values greater than 25th percentile of preoperative distribution) were associated with decreased risk of AF relapse at follow-up (hazard ratio ≤0.52, all p<0.05).ConclusionsRecurring patterns from preprocedural 1-minute recordings of ECG TQ intervals were significant predictors of CA 6-month outcome.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
There is considerable interest in developing tools capable of identifying patients likely to benefit from catheter ablation (CA) of AF. Termination of AF during CA is associated with longer-term maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR) [1–3]. Pre-ablation factors, such as AF cycle length (AFCL), left atrial diameter or volume, and duration of AF have been shown to predict the likelihood of termination [2,4]. Motivated by the clinical interest in non-invasive predictors of outcome from CA and electrical cardioversion the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) has also been studied. The f-wave, namely the atrial electrical signal (mainly observable in the TQ interval) has drawn considerable attention. Its amplitude and cycle length in preprocedural baseline recordings have been associated with acute [5–7] and intermediate [5,7] ablation outcomes. Techniques in the frequency or joint time-frequency domain, based on the spectral analysis of the estimated f-wave have also been applied to predict AF relapse following electrical cardioversion [8–10].Recurrence quantification analysis, by Eckmann and colleagues [11] for the identification of dynamic patterns in time-series, has also been deployed in AF studies [12–15]. The method is based on a graphical representation, termed recurrence plot, of recurring patterns of sub-intervals of a given time-series. Indices can be calculated to quantify percentage, duration, and distribution of recurring patterns. The strength of this analysis is that it does not require modelling of the time-series, nor the removal of outliers [16].At present, a quantitative non-invasive assessment of f-wave temporal predictability based on recurring patterns in individual ECG signals (auto-recurrence) is lacking, and might make prediction of acute and longer-term outcome following AF-ablation possible. In a previous study [17] we have successfully explored the ability of recurrence plot indices (RPIs) to predict acute and 3-month ablation outcome from preprocedural recordings of invasive intracardiac electrograms of the coronary sinus and right atrial appendage.The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of RPIs from surface ECG recordings to predict acute and postoperative (3-month and 6-month) ablation outcome.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Quantitative evidence of recurring patterns of atrial wavefront (f-wave) in TQ intervals of ECG lead V1 was shown in preprocedural 1-minute recordings. PD and ER were significant individual predictors of 6-month CA outcome.Higher values of either PR, PD, or ER (based on a priori thresholds calculated from the preoperative distribution of the given index) were associated with decreased risk of AF relapse at 3- and 6- month follow-up. TQ-RPIs, in particular ER, could be used to identify patients more likely to benefit from CA.None declared.
