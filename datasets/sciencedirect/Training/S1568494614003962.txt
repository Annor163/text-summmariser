@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Different methods are proposed in the framework of multi attribute utility theory for multi criteria decision making. Among the proposed methods, weighted sum and weighted product models (WSM and WPM) are well known and widely accepted. To improve the accuracy of WSM and WPM, the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method was proposed which used an aggregation operator on WSM and WPM. In this paper, an extended version of WASPAS method is proposed which can be applied in uncertain decision making environment. In the proposed WASPAS-IVIF method, the uncertainty of decision maker(s) in stating their judgments and evaluations regard to criteria importance and/or alternatives performance on criteria are expressed by interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Two numerical examples of ranking derelict buildings’ redevelopment decisions and investment alternatives are presented. The results are then compared with the rankings provided by other methods such as TOPSIS-IVIF, COPRAS-IVIF and IFOWA. Combining the strengths of IVIFS in handling uncertainty with the enhanced accuracy of WASPAS makes the proposed method as a desirable method for multi criteria decision making in real world applications.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
To achieve effective decisions in management and economic, mathematical modeling and conventional (hard) or soft computing can be successfully applied. Usually real world problems are complex and it is impossible to achieve any optimal decision considering only a single criterion. Yu [1] considered that decision making problems often include four basic elements: (1) the set of substitutive alternatives, (2) the set of evaluation criteria, (3) the outcome (or decision) matrix in regard to the alternatives scored based on the evaluation criteria, and (4) the preference structure of decision making about criteria importance or weights. For that purpose a large number of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been developed that differ in the required quantity and quality of information, the methodology, the mathematical properties and the user-friendliness [2].Moreover, uncertainty is an accepted paradigm in many practical fields, among them in decision making that is considered in this paper. Uncertainty arises due to the lack of knowledge and information. Yovits [3] believed that uncertainty can occur due to the fact that information is always (1) partial or (2) approximate. The partial or approximate information in a decision making problem means that decision makers do not have enough and well defined data about different elements of a decision problem as explained by Yu [1], while soft computing is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation. The uncertainty seems an important and inevitable rule in decision making problems since decision makers often prefer to express their opinions in a decision making problem as linguistic variables, especially about outcome matrix and preference structure of criteria importance. Therefore, uncertainty in a decision making problem is often related to criteria weights and/or the attractiveness of each alternative with regard to any criterion.Accordingly, this challenge enhanced scholars to extend some frameworks to deal with uncertainty. These frameworks were classified into three classes [4]: (1) probability and statistics, (2) fuzzy sets, and (3) gray systems. Bellman and Zadeh [5] and Dubois [6] highlighted the role of fuzzy set in decision making. In a simple world, fuzzy sets theory is a tool to describe the subjective and linguistic judgments of decision makers in a quantitative manner.Fuzzy sets are a generalization of conventional sets where the belongingness of an element to a set is shown by a function which is called membership function or degree. The advantages of fuzzy sets in describing uncertainty caused its wide applications in decision making problems. In fact, linguistic variables which are used by decision makers can be easily transformed into equivalent fuzzy values and the problem is analyzed as a fuzzy decision making problem – a decision making problem with fuzzy criteria weights and fuzzy outcome matrix. About 10 years after fuzzy set theory emersion, Gratten-Guinness [7] pointed that the presentation of a linguistic expression in the form of fuzzy set is not enough. He believed that expression of a linguistic variable in the form of a fuzzy set and representing its uncertainty by a membership degree is not suitable and it is so hard for decision maker to determine a unique number as membership degree. In fact, when a determined membership degree is assigned to each element of the set, it is assumed that there is not any hesitancy for decision maker in his or her specification of preferences. However this hesitancy is natural. Considering this phenomena, Atanassov [8] introduced the notion of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) as a generalization of the Zadeh's fuzzy sets. In addition to membership degree of each element in ordinal fuzzy sets, IFS assigns a degree of non-membership to each element. The hesitancy of decision maker is considered in IFS as the difference between membership degree and non-membership degree of each element. Later, Atanassov and Gargov [9] extended the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFS). The IVIFS improved the flexibility of IFS by defining membership and non-membership degrees as some closed intervals. Here again, the decision maker's hesitancy is considered as a closed interval. This hesitancy phenomenon increases the ability of IFS and consequently IVIFS in illustrating the uncertainty of decision makers’ opinions.IFS and IVIFS have wide applications to analyze problems with uncertainty; among them one can refer to multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) as well as multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems. A methodology was developed for solving MADM problems with both ratings of alternatives on attributes and weights are expressed with IVIFS [10]. In this methodology, a weighted absolute distance between IF sets is defined using weights of IF sets. Based on the concept of the relative closeness coefficients, a pair of nonlinear fractional programming models are constructed and transformed into two simpler auxiliary linear programming models which have been used to calculate the relative closeness coefficient intervals of alternatives to the IVIF positive ideal solution. These coefficients are applied to rank the order of alternatives based on the concept of likelihood of interval numbers. Chen et al. [11] proposed the IVIF weighted average operator and a fuzzy ranking method for intuitionistic fuzzy values. They presented a multi attribute method based on the proposed IVIF weighted average operator and the introduced fuzzy ranking method. In many cases ordinal technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method has been modified or extended. In [12–15] TOPSIS method under IVIFS was developed. Verma et al. [12] applied weighted Euclidean distances between alternatives and ideal solutions and compared alternatives closeness degree to the positive ideal solution to rank them. Ye [13] extended and applied TOPSIS-IVIF method in a partner selection problem. He used Euclidean distance to measure the distance between two IVIF numbers and weighted arithmetic mean to aggregate the individual judgment and to achieve a group decision. Park et al. [14] developed TOPSIS method based on different distance measures between IVIF values and used relative closeness of each alternative to the IVIF positive ideal solution to rank them. A new interval-valued fuzzy modified TOPSIS (IVFM-TOPSIS) method where the performance rating values and weights of criteria are linguistic variables expressed as triangular interval-valued fuzzy numbers was proposed [15]. Park et al. [16] extended the VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje; in Serbian) for multiple attribute group decision making in IVIF environment. They used IVIF hybrid geometric operator for aggregating individual decision matrices. The positive and negative ideal solutions are then determined and different distances are used to measure of closeness of each alternative to IVIF positive ideal solution. The most desirable alternatives are determined finally based on particular measure values. Wang et al. [17] proposed an MADM approach in IVIF environment. They employed a series of optimization models to derive a linear program for determining attribute weights. These weights are used to synthesize individual IVIF assessments into an aggregated IVIF value for each alternative. The aggregated values of alternatives are ranked by the membership uncertainty index and the hesitation uncertainty index was introduced in this paper. Zhao et al. [18] developed a set of generalized aggregation operators, such as generalized interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted average operator, intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted average operator (IFOWA) and others, and applied these operators in multi attribute decision making problems. Yu et al. [19] defined some interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators such as interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy prioritized weighted average (IVIFPWA) and the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy prioritized weighted geometric (IVIFPWG) operators and applied these operators in multi criteria group decision making problems. Wang and Liu [20] proposed an approach to IVIF-MADM problems. They introduced some Einstein geometric operators on IVIFS and proposed an approach based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein hybrid weighted geometric operator, IVIFHWG, to MADM. Razavi Hajiagha et al. [21] applied generalized interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted average operator to deal with a group MADM problem under IVIF environment and extended the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) method with IVIF information.The aim of the current research is to propose a methodology combining the strengths of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets in handling uncertainty with the enhanced accuracy of multiple criteria decision making. Accordingly, an extension of newly developed weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) [22] is proposed. WASPAS enables to reach the highest accuracy of estimation applying suggested methodology for optimization of weighted aggregated function. It was successfully applied for ecological–economical assessment of multi-dwelling houses modernization [23], selecting an appropriate location [24]. A case study of ranking the facades for public and commercial buildings was presented and verification of robustness of the method performed [25]. Searching the increase of ranking accuracy in a critical situation, crisp WASPAS was applied for selecting the best occupational safety solution during construction works [26]. In the current research the method is extended with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and called WASPAS-IVIF. The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are generalized form of fuzzy sets considering a non-membership degree in addition to ordinal membership degree of fuzzy numbers and show these degrees in intervals. This form allows having a better imagination from the real ambiguity and uncertainty of environment. Combining the strengths of WASPAS and IVIFS makes the proposed method as an effective tool for multi criteria decision making.The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents developments of WASPAS briefly, as it is a newly proposed method. The following Section 3 overviews interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Methodology and algorithm of WASPAS-IVIF are presented in Section 4. Finally, two numerical examples of derelict buildings’ redevelopment and investment decisions are presented in Section 5 and the results of WASPAS-IVIF are then compared with the rankings provided by other methods such as TOPSIS-IVIF [13], COPRAS-IVIF [21] and IFOWA [18]. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6.The weighted sum model (WSM) is one of the best known and often applied multiple criteria decision making methods for evaluating a number of alternatives in terms of a number of decision criteria. In general, suppose that a given MCDM problem is defined on m alternatives and n decision criteria. Next suppose that wjdenotes the relative significance (weight) of the criterion and xijis the performance value of alternative i when it is evaluated in terms of criterion j. Then, the total relative importance of alternative i, denoted asQi(1), is defined as follows [27–29]:(1)Qi(1)=∑j=1nx¯ijwj,where linear normalization of initial criteria values is applied i.e.(2)x¯ij=xijmaxixij,If maxixijvalue is preferable or(3)x¯ij=minixijxij,If minixijvalue is preferable.According to the weighted product model (WPM) the total relative importance of alternative i, denoted asQi(2), is defined as follows [29–31]:(4)Qi2=∏j=1n(x¯ij)wj.Supposing the increase of ranking accuracy and, respectively, the effectiveness of decision making, a joint criterion of WSM and WPM for determining a total importance of alternatives, called the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method, was proposed [22]:(5)Qi=λ∑j=1nx¯ijwj+(1−λ)∏j=1n(x¯ij)wj,λ=0,...,1.It was proposed to measure the accuracy of WASPAS based on initial criteria accuracy and when λ=0,…,1 (when λ=0, WASPAS is transformed to WPM; and when λ=1, WASPAS is transformed to WSM). It was proved that accuracy when aggregating methods is larger comparing to accuracy of single ones [22].Methodology for optimization of weighted aggregated function was proposed, that enabled to reach the highest accuracy of estimation [22]. Assuming that errors of determining the initial criteria values are stochastic, the variance σ2 is a measure of dispersion in the distribution. Variances of estimates of alternatives in the joint method depend on variances of WSM and WPM as well as coefficient λ. Accordingly, the optimal values of coefficient λ should be calculated to assure the maximal accuracy of estimation. Optimal values of λ can be calculated finding minimum dispersion σ2(Qi) when searching extreme of the function. Extreme of the function can be found when derivative of Eq. (5) in regard to λ is equated to zero. Optimal λ should be calculated for every alternative and may vary depending on ratio of σ2(Qi(1))/σ2(Qi(2)) in every particular case [25,26].In the current case accuracy of initial criteria was not evaluated dealing with uncertainty in decision environment. For future modifications a simplified WASPAS method [23,24] is applied, giving equal contribution of WSM and WPM for a total evaluation:(6)Qi=0.5Qi(1)+0.5Qi(2)=0.5∑j=1nx¯ijwj+0.5∏j=1n(x¯ij)wj.Atanassov [8] introduced the notion of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Let X be a fixed set. An intuitionistic fuzzy set A in E is defined as an object of the following form:(7)A=x,μA(x),vA(x)x∈X,where the functions:(8)μA:X→0,1and(9)vA:X→0,1are the degrees of membership and non-membership of the element x∈E, and for every x∈E:(10)0≤μA(x)+vA(x)≤1.Atanassov and Gargov [9] generalized the IFS to interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. LetD0,1be the set of all closed subintervals of the interval0,1. Let X(≠Φ) be a given set. An IVIFS in X is an expression given byA˜=x,μA˜(x),vA˜(x)x∈X, whereμA˜:X→D0,1,vA˜:X→D0,1with the condition0≺supxμA˜(x)+supxvA˜(x)≤1.For each x∈X,μA˜(x)andvA˜(x)are closed intervals whose lower and upper end points are denoted by μAL(x), μAU(x),vAL(x)andvAU(x). The IVIFS A is denoted by(11)A=x,μAL(x),μAU(x),vAL(x),vAU(x)x∈X,where0≺μAU(x)+vAU(x)≤1,μALx,vALx≥0. For convenience, an IVIFS value is denoted byA˜=([a,b],[c,d])and called as an interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy number (IVIFN).LetA˜1=([a1,b1],[c1,d1])andA˜2=([a1,b1],[c1,d1])be two IVIFNs. Their operational laws are defined as follows [32]:(12)A˜1+A˜2=([a1+a2−a1a2,b1+b2−b1b2],[c1c2,d1d2]),(13)A˜1⋅A˜2=([a1a2,b1b2],[c1+c2−c1c2,d1+d2−d1d2]),(14)λA˜1=([1−(1−a1)λ,1−(1−b1)λ],[c1λ,d1λ]),λ>0,(15)A˜1λ=([a1λ,b1λ],[1−(1−c1)λ,1−(1−d1)λ]),λ>0.For division operator, the extension principle of IVIFS can be applied [33]. ForA˜1=([a1,b1],[c1,d1])andA˜2=([a2,b2],[c2,d2])as two IVIFNs, the division operator can be defined as follows:(16)A˜1A˜2=([min(a1,a2),min(b1,b2)],[max(c1,c2),max(d1,d2)]).For an IVIFNA˜=([a,b],[c,d])the score function is defined as(17)s(A˜)=12(a−c+b−d),wheres(A˜)∈−1,1and the accuracy function of A is defined as follows:(18)h(A˜)=12(a+c+b+d).The ordering relations between IVIFNs were extended [32]. LetA˜1andA˜2be two IVIFNs. Therefore,(1)Ifs(A˜1)≺s(A˜2), thenA˜1is smaller thanA˜2,A˜1≺A˜2.Ifs(A˜1)=s(A˜2), then(2-1)Ifh(A˜1)=h(A˜2), thenA˜1=A˜2.Ifh(A˜1)≺h(A˜2), thenA˜1is smaller thanA˜2,A˜1≺A˜2.In group decision making problems, often it is required to aggregate the individual decision makers’ judgments in a single matrix. In this case, the aggregation of IVIFNs can be used. LetA˜j=([aj,bj],[cj,dj]),j=1,2,…,nbe a collection of IVIFNs. The generalized interval intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averageGIIFWAw(A˜1,A˜2,…,A˜n)is defined as follows:(19)GIIFWAw(A1,A2,…,An)=(w1A˜1λ+w2A˜2λ+⋯+wnA˜nλ)1/λ,where λ≻0, andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tis the weight vector withwj≥0,j=1,2,…,n, and∑j=1nwj=1.It can be shown that GIIFWA is also an IVIFN and can be calculated as follows [18]:(20)GIIFWAw(A˜1,A˜2,…,A˜n)=1−∏j=1n(1−ajλ)wj1/λ,1−∏j=1n(1−bjλ)wj1/λ,1−1−∏j=1n(1−(1−cj)λ)wj1/λ,1−1−∏j=1n(1−(1−dj)λ)wj1/λ.If λ=1, then GIIFWA is turned into interval intuitionistic fuzzy weighted average (IIFWA). In an IIFWA operator, thewjcan be considered as the ith decision makers opinion importance in decision making process.In this section, the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment method with interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy data, called WASPAS-IVIF, is introduced. Suppose a decision making problem in which a set of m alternatives A1, A2, …, Amare evaluated based on n criteria C1, C2, …, Cn. The performance or rating of each alternative i in each criterion j is estimated based on IVIFNs. Also, there is a group of K decision makers who will participate in decision process. Consider the kth decision maker, which he/she determines his/her preferences or evaluations regard to alternatives against criteria according to the following matrix:(21)X˜k=x˜11kx˜12k…x˜1nkx˜21kx˜22k…x˜2nk⋮⋮⋮⋮x˜m1kx˜m2k…x˜mnk,wherex˜ijk=([μLijk,μUijk],[vLijk,vUijk])is the IVIFN of alternative i against criterion j.There are different ways to specify the values ofx˜ijk: (1) the DM can directly estate the preferences based on IVIF by determining a membership and a non-membership interval; (2) the DM can specify the preferences based on crisp, fuzzy or intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Then, the Bustince and Burillo theorem [26] can be applied to transform the specified values to an associated IVIF value; and (3) the following scale (Table 1) can be used to determine alternatives performance regard to criteria. These scales are developed by applying Bustince and Burillo [34] theorem on an intuitionistic fuzzy scale which previously extended and applied by Boran et al. [35].Another element which must be determined in initial step is developing a set of weights for evaluation criteria, theW˜k=(w˜1k,w˜2k,…,w˜nk)vector, wherew˜jk=([μLjk,μUjk],[vLjk,vUjk])is the kth expert's judgment on the importance of the jth criterion. These weights can be determined by different methods or DMs can specify their opinions regarding these weights based on the following scale (Table 2):The next step is to aggregate the individual decision makers’ matrices in an aggregated matrix and determine the aggregated weights of criteria. These steps can be done based on the IIFWA operator, Eq. (19). Now, suppose that the aggregated decision matrixX˜is constructed by applying the IIFWA operator on individual decision matrices (as was shown in Eq. (20)):(22)X˜=x˜11x˜12…x˜1nx˜21x˜22…x˜2n⋮⋮⋮⋮x˜m1x˜m2…x˜mn,wherex˜ij=([μLij,μUij],[vLij,vUij]).Also the aggregated weight vector of criteria isW˜=(w˜1,w˜2,…,w˜n), wherew˜j=([μLj,μUj],[vLj,vUj]).The first step in WASPAS-IVIF is to normalize theX˜matrix with a linear method. Let the criteria be classified to a subset of benefit criteria, B, and a subset of cost criteria, C. The linear normalization for any j∈B is defined as follows:(23)x¯˜ij=x˜ijmaxix˜ij,wheremaxix˜ijis determined as follows:(24)maxix˜ij=([maxiμLij,maxiμUij],[minivLij,minivUij]).And the linear normalization for any j∈C is defined as follows:(25)x¯˜ij=minix˜ijx˜ij,where(26)minix˜ij=([miniμLij,miniμUij],[maxivLij,maxivUij]).It can be easily shown that based on the definition of score function,x˜ij≤maxix˜ij,∀i,j:i=1,2,…,m,j∈Candmaxix˜ij≤x˜ij,∀i,j:i=1,2,…,m,j∈C. The division operations in Eq. (23) and Eq. (25) are performed based on the Eq. (16). The decision matrixX˜is transformed into the normalized matrixX¯˜:(27)X¯˜=x¯˜11x¯˜12…x¯˜1nx¯˜21x¯˜22…x¯˜2n⋮⋮⋮⋮x¯˜m1x¯˜m2…x¯˜mn.According to WASPAS methodology, the sum total relative importance of alternative i, denoted asQi1is defined as follow:(28)Q˜i1=∑j=1nx¯˜ij⋅w˜j.In Eq. (28), the multiplication ofx¯˜⋅w˜j,j=1,2,…,nis done based on Eq. (13), while the summation of obtained values are performed based on Eq. (12). It is notable thatQ˜i(1)is an IVIFN.On the other hand, the product total relative importance of alternative i, denoted asQ˜i2, is defined as follows:(29)Q˜i2=∏j=1n(x¯˜ij)w˜j.The Eq. (29) required to take an IVIFN,x¯˜ij, to the power of another IVIFN,w˜j. To perform the power operation, the extension principle can be used [33]. Letx˜ij=([μLij,μUij],[vLij,vUij])andw˜j=([μLj,μUj],[vLj,vUj])are two IVIFNs. Then, according to IVIFNs extension principle, the(x¯˜ij)w˜jcan be defined as follows:(30)(x¯˜ij)w˜j=([min(μLij,μLj),min(μUij,μUj)],[max(vLij,vLj),max(vUij,vUj)]).Then, the product operation in Eq. (29) is performed on the(x¯˜ij)w˜j,j=1,2,…,nvalues based on Eq. (15). Here again theQ˜i2is an IVIFN. Finally, the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method for ranking of alternatives is calculated as:(31)Q˜i=0.5Q˜i1+0.5Q˜i2.This value is calculated by applying Eq. (14) and then Eq. (12).In the last step, the score and accuracy functions are calculated forQ˜i,i=1,2,…,mand the final rankings of alternatives are determined based on the descending order ofQ˜i,i=1,2,…,m.Fig. 1illustrates the proposed group WASPAS-IVIF decision making algorithm.Two applications of the proposed method are presented. Numerical examples of ranking derelict buildings’ redevelopment decisions and investment alternatives applying WASPAS-IVIF are shown. The results are then compared with the rankings provided by other multiple criteria decision making methods such as TOPSIS-IVIF, COPRAS-IVIF and IFOWA.In the presented case study possibilities of rational revitalization of derelict and mismanaged buildings in Lithuania's rural areas is analyzed. These structures were built in Soviet period, mostly for farming and, partly, for rural infrastructure. Due to political and economic changes as well as restructuring of the agricultural sector, they have become derelict and are mismanaged at present.Three alternative decisions for regeneration of rural property are suggested and implicated in the future evaluation. The possible alternatives include reconstruction of rural buildings and adapting them to production (or commercial) activities, improving and using them for farming or dismantling and recycling the demolition waste materials.The data is grouped in three regions according to a concept of the country's spatial development, i.e. areas of active development, areas of regressing development and ‘buffer’ areas (a middle place according to the characteristic of activity, geographical and environmental situation and the peculiarities of the local population).Sustainable development approach is used for identifying rational redevelopment trends of abandoned rural buildings and a set of criteria is developed according to the principles of sustainability. Criteria involve impact of buildings on natural environment, the economic benefits and changes in the local population's quality of life.To determine the value and the utility degree of revitalization variants and to establish the priority order of their implementation based on a set of criteria, MCDM methods can be used effectively. Previous research works of MCDM application for selecting the most rational redevelopment alternative of derelict buildings have been presented in a number of publications of the Authors. TOPSIS, COPRAS and VIKOR methods with triangular fuzzy numbers for buildings’ redevelopment problems have been applied and comparative analysis of ranking results has been performed by Zavadskas and Antucheviciene [36–38].The presented example analyses what is the best revitalization variant in a particular location. Moreover, the calculations are performed according to two main strategic goals for the regional policy that are set in the Master Plan of the territory of the Republic of Lithuania, that provides for maintaining the existing economic potential of a region and harmonization of regional development.The alternatives include reconstruction of rural buildings and adapting them to production (or commercial) activities (alternative A1), improving and using them for farming (alternative A2) or dismantling and recycling the demolition waste materials (alternative A3).The following fifteen criteria have been taken into consideration, including:•the average soil fertility in the area x1 (points),quality of life of the local population x2 (points),population activity index x3 (%),GDP proportion with respect to the average GDP of the country x4 (%),material investment in the area x5 (LTL per resident),foreign investments in the area x6 (LTL×103 per resident),building redevelopment costs x7 (LTL×106),increase of the local population's income x8 (LTL×106 per year),increase of sales in the area x9 (%),increase of employment in the area x10 (%),state income from business and property taxes x11 (LTL×106 per year),business outlook x12,difficulties in changing the original purpose of a site x13,degree of contamination x14,attractiveness of the countryside (i.e. image, landscape, etc.) x15.The qualitative attributes x12, x13, x14 and x15 and their ratings are expressed by linguistic variables.The example of revitalization variants in areas of active development after implementation of the first strategy (maintenance of existing potential in a region) is presented. Initial data is presented in Table 3.The normalized decision matrix will be obtained by applying Eqs. (23) and (25) based on Eq. (16), as shown in Table 4.Finally, the WSM-IVIF(Q˜i1), WPM-IVIF (Q˜i2) and WASPAS-IVIF (Q˜i) are calculated for all of the alternatives. The results are shown in Table 5. Since the attributes’ weights are determined as crisp numbers in this example, these values are calculated by Eqs. (12) and (14).The rankings of alternatives in Table 5 are obtained by calculating the score functions of WASPAS-IVIF. It can be seen that the most preferred alternative is A1 and then the alternatives A2 and A3 are in the 2nd and 3rd places. Therefore, reconstruction of rural buildings and adapting them to production (or commercial) activities will be preferred to other alternatives.This problem also is solved applying TOPSIS-IVIF [13], IFOWA aggregation method [18], and COPRAS-IVIF [21]. The results are shown in Table 6.First of all, the Kendall's coefficient of concordance is 0.81 which indicates a great consensus over different ranking methods. Also, the ranking results are completely coinciding in the proposed WASPAS-IVIF method with IFOWA [18] and TOPSIS-IVIF [13] methods. These observations imply a great congruence among WASPAS-IVIF with other methods.Wang et al. [17] examined a decision problem including the evaluation of four potential investment alternativesA=A1,A2,A3,A4based on four attributes: risk (C1), growth (C2), socio-political issues (C3) and environment impacts (C4). The fund manager has provided each alternative on each attribute as an IVIFN. The provided decision matrix is as follows:x1x2x3x4X˜=A1A2A3A40.42,0.48,0.4,0.50.6,0.7,0.05,0.250.4,0.5,0.2,0.50.55,0.75,0.15,0.250.4,0.5,0.4,0.50.5,0.8,0.1,0.20.3,0.6,0.3,0.40.6,0.7,0.1,0.30.3,0.5,0.4,0.50.1,0.3,0.2,0.40.7,0.8,0.1,0.20.5,0.7,0.1,0.20.2,0.4,0.4,0.50.6,0.7,0.2,0.30.5,0.6,0.2,0.30.7,0.8,0.1,0.2This problem is solved applying some different methods, including the proposed WASPAS-IVIF and results of these methods are summarized in Table 7.Here, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient values (rs) are measured to illustrate the similarity between different ranking methods. Table 8shows the Spearman's rank correlation between five methods. The percentages specified in parenthesis in Table 8 show the matched ranks with Wang et al. [17] method as the percentages of matched alternatives.The relative performance of these methods with respect to the ranking of Wang et al. [17] is well visualized using the value of Z as below:(32)Z=rsm−1.Fig. 2plots the Z values for all the considered ranking methods.Based on the above criteria, the following conclusions can be made:-Considering the Spearman's coefficient, it is clear that except for COPRAS-IVIF method which completely matched with Wang et al. [17] method, the WASPAS-IVIF method has the highest similarity of 80% with the whole other methods.Based on the percentage of matched ranking with Wang et al. [17], the highest degree of congruence is observed with COPRAS-IVIF, and it is followed by WASPAS-IVIF that has the highest matched degree with Wang et al. [17] among the rest analyzed methods.The Z values (Fig. 2) represent that WASPAS-IVIF has the best performance after COPRAS-IVIF method.In addition to mentioned results, an important characteristic of WASPAS-IVIF is that it has the best performance in comparison with all other methods in this example that can be pointed as its main advantage.

Complexity and uncertainty of decisions is an accepted paradigm in real world problems.Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) can be successfully applied to rank complex alternative decisions and to achieve optimal solutions based on multiple, usually conflicting criteria.Weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method is preferred to the variety of available methods because of its abilities to increase the accuracy of ranking. However, usual crisp WASPAS is unable to handle with uncertainty and imprecision. Consequently, extended version of the method, i.e. WASPAS-IVIF is proposed for uncertain decision making environment. Interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) numbers are applied to express alternatives performance on criteria and evaluations regard to criteria importance. The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are preferred to traditional fuzzy sets because of the ability of considering a non-membership degree in addition to ordinal membership degree of fuzzy numbers and showing these degrees in intervals. This form allows having a better imagination from the real ambiguity and uncertainty of environment. Next, aggregation operator for individual decision makers’ judgments is applied, operational laws of IVIF numbers are used, the score and the accuracy functions are calculated and ordering relations between IVIF numbers are estimated.The application of extended method is illustrated by a case study of rational revitalization of derelict and mismanaged buildings according to principles of sustainable development. Also, an example taken from Wang et al. [17] is solved with some other methods, including the proposed WASPAS-IVIF, and their results are compared. These examples showed a good consistency between WASPAS-IVIF and other methods such as TOPSIS-IVIF, COPRAS-IVIF and IFOWA. Therefore, computational easiness, a clear and accepted logic of simultaneously considering weighted sum average and weighted product average, and consistency with other methods can be pointed as the main advantages of the proposed method. Combining the strengths of IVIFS in handling uncertainty with the enhanced accuracy of WASPAS makes the proposed method as a perfect tool for solving management decision or strategy selection problems.
