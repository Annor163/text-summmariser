@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The voting system of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (Legco) is sometimes unicameral and sometimes bicameral, depending on whether the bill is proposed by the Hong Kong government. Therefore, although without any representative within Legco, the Hong Kong government has certain degree of legislative power – as if there is a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government within the Legco. By introducing such a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government, we show that Legco is a three-dimensional voting system. We also calculate two power indices of the Hong Kong government through this virtual representative and consider the C-dimension and the W-dimension of Legco. Finally, some implications of this Legco model to the current constitutional reform in Hong Kong will be given.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The voting system used in the Hong Kong Legislative Council (Legco) is unique within the current, global range of electoral systems because it is sometimes unicameral and sometimes bicameral, depending on whether the bill is proposed by the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Because of this special feature, it would be interesting to study this voting system from the mathematical point of view. In this article, we shall construct a mathematical model of this voting system and conduct a detailed mathematical analysis of it. For example, we shall measure the complexity of the voting mechanism of Legco by computing its dimension.It was proposed in Taylor (1995) that different voting systems can be classified by their dimensions. We shall state the precise definition of the dimension of a voting system in the next section but it is easier to grasp the idea by considering some examples. The usual unicameral system in which the bills will be passed by a simple majority vote of the members is a one dimensional voting system. Bicameral legislatures require a concurrent majority to pass legislation are two dimensional voting systems. In 1995, Alan D. Taylor mentioned in Taylor (1995) that he did not know any real-world voting system of dimension 3 or higher and this point was reiterated in page 255 of the second edition of Taylor (1995). Such a real-world voting system of dimension 3 was first provided by Josep Freixas in 2004. He showed in Freixas (2004) that the dimension of the European Union Council under the Nice rules (since 2000) is 3. In this article, we shall show that the voting system of Legco (since 1998) is also of dimension 3. So we have two very different real voting systems of dimension 3.By 2014, Legco consists of two groups of legislators: one group comprising 35 members selected in the functional constituencies and the other group comprising the remaining 35 members elected by universal suffrage in the geographical constituencies. About half of the 35 functional constituencies seats go to business sectors, about one-third belongs to sectors for professionals and the rest are for representatives of social organizations or district councils. For a detailed analysis of the functional constituencies, see Loh and Civic Exchange (2006) and Ma (2009).Since the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, in order to strengthen the executive dominance over the legislature, the Basic Law (the constitutional document for the HKSAR) requires the passage of motions, bill or amendments to government bills introduced by legislators to pass by the concurrent majorities of two groups. On the other hand, motions, amendments to motions, bills and amendments to bill raised by the Hong Kong government only need a simple majority vote of the members present to pass.Therefore, Legco is sometimes unicameral and sometimes bicameral, depending on whether the bill is proposed by the Hong Kong government. This unique feature of Legco makes the computation of the dimension of it a non-trivial task. For example, given a coalition of 35 members from the geographical constituencies and 2 members from the functional constituencies, there is no way to tell if it is a winning coalition or a losing coalition (unless you know if the bill is proposed by the Hong Kong government). To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government, which will vote for a bill if it is proposed by the government but against a bill otherwise. To be more precise, the 35 members from geographical constituencies are numbered1,…,35, the 35 members from functional constituencies are numbered36,…,70, and the virtual member (the government) is numbered 71. Then, a coalition or subset S of the set[opencurl]1,2,…,70,71[closecurl]is a winning coalition if and only if(a)71∈Sand|S∩[opencurl]1,…,70[closecurl]|⩾36, or71∉S,|S∩[opencurl]1,…,35[closecurl]|>18and|S∩[opencurl]36,…,70[closecurl]|>18.With this mathematical model of Legco, the voting system of Legco becomes a simple game (see the definition in the next section) and it is now possible to compute the dimension of Legco which will turn out to be 3 (see Section 3).Although there is no representative of the government of HKSAR in Legco, this voting system has given the Hong Kong government a certain degree of legislative power. With the introduction of member 71, the virtual representative of the government, we can then calculate various power indices of the Hong Kong government within Legco and compare its power with that of any individual Legco member. This will be done in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we shall discuss some implications of our mathematical analysis of Legco to the current constitutional reform in Hong Kong.Definition 1A (monotonic) simple game or a voting system is a pair(N,v)whereN=[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]is the set of players andv:2N→[opencurl]0,1[closecurl]is the characteristic function defined on the power set2Nof N, which satisfiesv(ϕ)=0,v(N)=1andv(S)⩽v(T)wheneverS⊆T. A coalition of playersS⊆Nis winning ifv(S)=1and losing ifv(S)=0.A weighted majority game is a simple game which can be realized by a vector(w1,…,wn)together with a threshold q which makes the representation[q;w1,…,wn]in such a way that S is a winning coalition if and only if∑j∈Swj⩾q.A weighted m-majority game is a simple game which can be expressed by m realizations[qi;w1i,…,wni],1⩽i⩽m, in such a way that S is a winning coalition if and only if∑j∈Swji⩾qifor all1⩽i⩽m. So a weighted m-majority game can be considered as an intersection of m weighted majority games and we can also represent it by an amalgamated matrixq1;w11⋯wn1⋮⋮qm;w1m⋯wnm.Every weighted majority game is obviously a (monotonic) simple game. However, the converse is in general not true and we shall see in the next section that the voting system of Legco is not a weighted majority game. To show that certain voting system cannot be realized as a weighted majority game, it would be useful to know that any weighted majority game must be swap robust, namely, for any two winning coalitions S andS′in a weighted voting system, if we make a one-for-one exchange of players, then at least one of the two resulting coalitions must still be a winning coalition (see Taylor (1995)). Here one of the players in the swap must belong to S but notS′, and the other must belong toS′but not S.Even though not any simple game is a weighted majority game, it was proved in Taylor (1995) that every simple game can be realized as a weighted m-majority game. The smallest such possible m is called the dimension of the game.The computation of the dimension of a simple game has been proved to be a hard computational problem (see Deineko & Woeginger (2006)), thus our calculation is a complex task which will be done by combinatorial arguments for the particular voting system at hand. The dimension of other complex voting systems using combinatorial arguments were studied quite recently in Freixas and Puente (2008).However, even if two games are of the same dimension, they may not be equivalent. In the literature, different types of dimensions have been introduced (see Freixas & Marciniak (2009)). Before giving their definitions, we need to introduce two orderings related to the power of individual members in a game (see Carreras & Freixas (2008)).For anyi,j∈N, we say thati≤Djif for anyU⊂Nsuch thati,j∉U, we haveU∪[opencurl]j[closecurl]is a winning coalition wheneverU∪[opencurl]i[closecurl]is. A game is complete if≤Dis total. It is known that a game is complete if and only if it is swap robust.Ani∈Nis crucial in a winning coalition U ifU⧹[opencurl]i[closecurl]is no longer winning. We say thati≤djif the number of winning coalitions of size k containing i with i crucial is smaller than or equal to the number of those containing j with j crucial for all1⩽k⩽n. A game is weakly complete if≤dis total.Every simple game can be realized as an interaction of a finite number of complete games, the smallest possible number is called the C-dimension of the game. Likewise, every simple game can be realized as an interaction of a finite number of weakly complete games, the smallest possible number is called the W-dimension of the game. For a detailed analysis of various types of dimensions, we refer the readers to Freixas and Marciniak (2009).Every weighted game is complete and every complete game is weakly complete (see Carreras & Freixas (2008)). Hence,1.W-dimension (v)⩽C-dimension (v)⩽dimension (v) for all simple game v;if the simple game v is weighted, then dimension (v) is 1 and hence both W-dimension (v) and C-dimension (v) are equal to 1;if the simple game v is complete, then C-dimension (v) is equal to 1 and therefore W-dimension (v) is also equal to 1.Recall that the Legco members are divided into two groups: half of the members are returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections, and the other half by functional constituencies. On the writing of this article, there are 70 members in the current fifth term Legco (2012–2016). The composition of Legco beyond the third term is not specified in the Basic Law (the constitutional document for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region). However, article 68 of the Basic Law requires that“The method for forming the Legislative Council shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage.”While the Basic Law now no longer expressly dictates the formation of the fifth term Legco of HKSAR in the year 2012, in December 2007, the Standing Committee of National People’s Congress (SCNPC) decided that“The ratio of functional constituency members to geographical constituency members shall not be changed and the procedures for voting on bills and motions in the Legislative Council shall remain unchanged.”The details of the decisions of SCNPC in December 2007 can be found in http://www.legco.hk (the official website of Hong Kong Legislative Council).In view of the above constraints on the pace of constitutional reform in Hong Kong, it makes sense to assume that Legco has2nlegislative members, say represented by1,…,2n, with n an arbitrary positive integer. We further assume that among the2nLegco members, the first n members are returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections, while the remaining n members are returned by functional constituencies.We also assume that a bill will be passed if(a)the bill is proposed by the Hong Kong government and it is supported by a simple majority in Legco; orthe bill is proposed by a Legco member and it is supported by a simple majority in each of the two groups.Finally, we again introduce a virtual representative of the Hong Kong government (denoted by2n+1), which will vote for a bill if it is proposed by the government but against a bill otherwise. Now we can reformulate Legco as a simple game of size2n+1.Definition 2Legco of size2nis a (monotonic) simple game of2n+1players1,…,2n+1, such that S is a winning coalition if one of the following holds:2n+1∈SandS∩[opencurl]1,…,2n[closecurl]⩾n+12n+1∉Sand|S∩[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]|>n2and|S∩[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl]|>n2.Our first result is a comparison of powers among individuals.Proposition 1(a)j=Dkfor any1⩽j,k⩽norn+1⩽j,k⩽2n.1=dn+1but 1 andn+1are not D-comparable.When n is even,j<D2n+1for any1⩽j⩽2n.If n is odd andn>4, then j and2n+1are not d-comparable for any1⩽j⩽2n.(a) and (b) are trivial.For (c) and (d), we assumej=1. ConsiderU=[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl]. Obviously (P):U∪[opencurl]2n+1[closecurl]is winning butU∪[opencurl]1[closecurl]is not.(c) Suppose n is even. IfS∪[opencurl]1[closecurl]is winning for some coalitionS∌1, then|S∩[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]|⩾n2and|S∩[opencurl]n+1,…,2n-1[closecurl]|⩾n2+1.Thus|S|⩾n+1and henceS∪[opencurl]2n+1[closecurl]is a winning coalition. Therefore1≤D2n+1.Together with (P), we have1<D2n+1.(d) Suppose n is odd. We haveS=[opencurl]1,…,(n+1)/2[closecurl]∪[opencurl]n+1,…,(3n+1)/2[closecurl]which is a winning coalition of sizen+1with 1 crucial, but there is no winning coalition of sizen+1with2n+1crucial. On the other hand, from (P), clearly there are less winning coalitions of size2nwith 1 crucial then those with2n+1crucial. Therefore, we have 1 and2n+1are not d-comparable.□.Our first main result is the following.Theorem 1Legco of size2nis of dimension 1 ifn=1or 2, of dimension 2 ifn=3or 4, and of dimension 3 ifn⩾5.Forn=1or 2, Legco is of dimension 1 as one can check easily that Legco of size 2 is realized by[2;1,1,0]and Legco of size 4 is realized by[4;1,1,1,1,1].So we shall letn⩾3and we shall use⌊x⌋and⌈x⌉to denote the greatest integer less than or equal to x and the least integer greater than or equal to x respectively.Recall that Legco is of dimension 1 means that it is a weighted majority game (which must be swap robust). LetS=[opencurl]1,…,⌊n/2⌋,⌊n/2⌋+1,n+1,…,n+⌊n/2⌋,n+⌊n/2⌋+1[closecurl]andS′=[opencurl]1,…,⌊n/2⌋,⌊n/2⌋+2,n+1,…,n+⌊n/2⌋,n+⌊n/2⌋+2[closecurl]. Then both of them are winning coalitions of Legco. Now if we swap⌊n/2⌋+1in S withn+⌊n/2⌋+2inS′, then we get the following two coalitions[opencurl]1,…,⌊n/2⌋,n+1,…,n+⌊n/2⌋,n+⌊n/2⌋+1,⌊n/2⌋+2[closecurl]and[opencurl]1,…,⌊n/2⌋,⌊n/2⌋+1,⌊n/2⌋+2,n+1,…,n+⌊n/2⌋[closecurl].Since both of them are losing coalitions, Legco is not swap robust. Hence, forn⩾3, Legco of size2ncannot be of C-dimension 1 and of dimension 1 as it is not swap robust.Forn=3or 4, Legco is of dimension 2 as one can check easily that Legco of size 6 can be realized by10;2,2,2,3,3,3,110;3,3,3,2,2,2,1and Legco of size 8 can be realized by15;2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,415;3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,4.From now on, we will assume thatn⩾5. We first show that Legco of size2ncan be realized as a 3-weighted majority game.LetA=n+1;1⋯1︷n1⋯1︷n0n+12;1⋯10⋯0n2n+12;0⋯01⋯1n2.We will show that the winning coalitions of the game realized by A are exactly the winning coalitions of Legco. Hence A realizes Legco and the dimension of Legco is less than or equal to 3.Note thatS⊂[opencurl]1,…,2n+1[closecurl]is a winning coalition of the 3-weighted majority game defined by the amalgamated matrix A if and only if(i)S∩[opencurl]1,…,2n[closecurl]⩾n+1; and|S∩[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]|+n2|S∩[opencurl]2n+1[closecurl]|⩾n+12; and|S∩[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl]|+n2|S∩[opencurl]2n+1[closecurl]|⩾n+12.It is clear that2n+1∈Sandi,ii,iiihold⇔2n+1∈Sand i holds. Also,2n+1∉Sandi,ii,iiihold⇔2n+1∉Sandi,iihold. Therefore S is a winning coalition of the game induced by the amalgamated matrix A if and only if S is a winning coalition of Legco and we are done.Finally, it remains to show that the dimension of Legco cannot be 2.SupposeB=q1;e11⋯en1f11⋯fn1g1q2;e12⋯en2f12⋯fn2g2realizes Legco. Let W be a winning coalition of the game induced by B. IfW=E∪F, whereE⊆[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]andF⊆[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl], then for any permutationσon[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]and permutationτon[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl],σ(E)∪τ(F)is also a winning coalition as any ordinary member of Legco has the same voting power. Therefore,∑k∈Eeσ(k)i+∑j∈Ffτ(j)-ni⩾qi, fori=1,2.Start with an equality∑k∈Eeki+∑j∈Ffji⩾qifor a fixed i, by considering suitable permutation pairsσandτ, we can obtainnC|E|×nC|F|similar inequalities. Summing all these inequalities and we notice that for each k and l, there aren-1C|E|-1×nC|F|ekiandnC|E|×n-1C|F|-1fliin the resulting inequality. Divide the whole inequality bynC|E|×nC|F|, we have|E|ei+|F|fi⩾qi, whereei=1n(e1i+⋯+eni)andfi=1n(f1i+·+fni),i=1,2. Similarly, if the winning coalition W is of the formW=E∪F∪[opencurl]2n+1[closecurl], whereE⊆[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]andF⊆[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl], then we have|E|ei+|F|fi+gi⩾qi,i=1,2. Therefore, if we consider another amalgamated matrixB′=q1;e1⋯e1f1⋯f1g1q2;e2⋯e2f2⋯f2g2, then any winning coalition of B must be a winning coalition ofB′. By using a similar argument, we can also show that any losing coalition of B must be a losing coalition ofB′. Hence, the games induced by B andB′will have exactly the same set of the winning coalitions. Therefore without loss of generality, for B, we can assume thate1i=⋯=eni=eiandf1i=⋯=fni=fi,i=1,2. Sinceekiandfkiare non-negative and B realizes Legco, we must haveei>0andfi>0.Note that[opencurl]1,…,⌊n/2⌋+1,n+1,…,n+⌊n/2⌋+1[closecurl]is a winning coalition of Legco and hence(⌊n/2⌋+1)ei+(⌊n/2⌋+1)fi⩾qi,i=1,2.On the other hand,[opencurl]1,…,n,n+1,…,n+⌊n/2⌋[closecurl]is not a winning coalition of Legco and hence eitherne1+⌊n/2⌋f1<q1orne2+⌊n/2⌋f2<q2. If it is the former case, thenne1+⌊n/2⌋f1<q1⩽(⌊n/2⌋+1)e1+(⌊n/2⌋+1)f1and thus(⌈n/2⌉-1)e1<f1. Similarly if it is the latter case, then(⌈n/2⌉-1)e2<f2.By symmetry, we also have(⌈n/2⌉-1)f1<e1or(⌈n/2⌉-1)f2<e2. Note that if(⌈n/2⌉-1)e1<f1and(⌈n/2⌉-1)f1<e1, then we have(⌈n/2⌉-1)2<1which is impossible forn⩾3. Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume that(⌈n/2⌉-1)e1<f1and(⌈n/2⌉-1)f2<e2.Now[opencurl]1,…,⌈n/2⌉+1,n+1,…,n+⌊n/2⌋,2n+1[closecurl](which hasn+1ordinary Legco members) is a winning coalition of Legco, thus(⌈n/2⌉+1)e1+(⌊n/2⌋)f1+g1⩾q1. It follows from(⌈n/2⌉-1)e1<f1that2e1+(⌊n/2⌋+1)f1+g1⩾q1.Clearly,[opencurl]1,n+1,…,2n,2n+1[closecurl]is also a winning coalition of Legco, thuse2+nf2+g2⩾q2. It follows from(⌈n/2⌉-1)f2<e2that2e2+(⌊n/2⌋+1)f2+g2⩾q2.Since the setS=[opencurl]1,2,n+1,…,n+⌊n/2⌋+1,2n+1[closecurl]has⌊n/2⌋+3ordinary Legco members and⌊n/2⌋+3<n+1forn⩾5,Sis a losing coalition of Legco. On the other hand, we have2e1+(⌊n/2⌋+1)f1+g1⩾q1and2e2+(⌊n/2⌋+1)f2+g2⩾q2and hence S is a winning coalition of the 2-majority game induced by B. This is a contradiction and therefore B cannot realize Legco and we are done.□By Theorems 1 and 2.1 of Freixas (2004), both Lego and European Union Council under the Nice rules (since 2000) are of dimension 3. However, they are very different voting systems. For example, the voting system of the European Union Council has a huge number of voters and the system itself is sophistically described with a great number of different equi-desirability classes, while the Legco voting system has just three types of voters. On the other hand, the European voting system is a complete (or swap robust) simple game while the Legco voting system is not by Proposition 1. Moreover, it was pointed out by the referee of this paper that the voting system of the European Union Council has dimension 3 but C-dimension 1 (which implies that it also has W-dimension 1) and suggested to find out the C-dimension and the W-dimension of Legco.Theorem 21.When n is even andn>4, Legco of size2nis of W-dimension 1 and C-dimension 2.When n is odd andn>4, Legco of size2nis of W-dimension 2 and C-dimension 3.1.Whenn=2kis even, the voting system is weakly complete by Proposition 1. It is not swap robust and therefore must be of C-dimension greater than 1. Note that it is the intersection of the two compete systems below:System 1:(a)2n+1∈SandS∩[opencurl]1,…,2n[closecurl]⩾2k+12n+1∉SandS∩[opencurl]1,…,2n[closecurl]⩾2k+2and|S∩[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]|⩾k+1.System 2:(a)2n+1∈SandS∩[opencurl]1,…,2n[closecurl]⩾2k+12n+1∉SandS∩[opencurl]1,…,2n[closecurl]⩾2k+2and|S∩[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl]|⩾k+1.Therefore it is of C-dimension 2.Whenn=2k+1is odd, the voting system is not weakly complete as 1 and2n+1are not d-comparable. However, it is the intersection of two weakly completed systems realized by the matrices below:n+1;1⋯1︷n1⋯1︷n0,n+12;1⋯10⋯0n2n+12;0⋯01⋯1n2.Therefore it is of W-dimension 2.It remains to show that the system cannot be of C-dimension 2. Suppose on the contrary, it is the intersection of two complete systemsS1andS2.Consider two winning coalitions of our system:[opencurl]1,…,k+1,n+1,…,n+k+1[closecurl]and[opencurl]1,…,k,k+2,n+1,…,n+k,n+k+2[closecurl]. Exchangek+1andn+k+2, we have losing coalitionsL1=[opencurl]1,…,k,n+1,…,n+k+2[closecurl]andL2=[opencurl]1,…,k+2,n+1,…,n+k[closecurl]. SinceS1andS2are swap robust, we can assume thatL1is a winning coalition ofS1but not ofS2, andL2is a winning coalition ofS2but not ofS1.Consider another two winning coalitions:[opencurl]1,…,k+1,n+1,…,n+k+1[closecurl]and[opencurl]1,…,k-1,k+1,k+2,n+1,…,n+k,n+k+2[closecurl]. Exchange k andn+k+2, we have losing coalitionsL3=[opencurl]1,…,k-1,k+1,n+1,…,n+k+2[closecurl]andL2. SinceL2is a winning coalition ofS2, we haveL3is a winning coalition ofS1.Consider yet another two winning coalitions:[opencurl]1,…,k+1,n+1,…,n+k+1[closecurl]and[opencurl]1,…,k,k+2,n+1,…,n+k,n+k+3[closecurl]. Exchangek+1andn+k+2, we have losing coalitionsL4=[opencurl]1,…,k,n+1,…,n+k+1,n+k+3[closecurl]andL2. Once again,L4is a winning coalition ofS1.Consequently if|L∩[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]|⩾kand|L∩[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl]|⩾k+2, then L is a winning coalition ofS1; if|L∩[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]|⩾k+2and|L∩[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl]|⩾k, then L is a winning coalition ofS2.Consider[opencurl]1,…,k,k+2,k+3,n+1,…,n+k,2n+1[closecurl]and[opencurl]1,…,k+1,n+1,…,n+k+1[closecurl]. Exchange2n+1andk+1. We get losing coalitionsL5=[opencurl]1,…,k+3,n+1,…,n+k[closecurl]andL6=[opencurl]1,…,k,n+1,…,n+k+1,2n+1[closecurl].L5is a winning coalition ofS2and soL6is a winning coalition ofS1.Consider[opencurl]1,…,k-1,n+1,…,n+k+2,2n+1[closecurl]and[opencurl]1,…,k+1,n+1,…,n+k+1[closecurl]. Exchange2n+1andk+1. We get losing coalitionsL7=[opencurl]1,…,k-1,k+1,n+1,…,n+k+2[closecurl]andL6. Both are winning coalitions ofS1and so none are winning coalitions ofS2, contradicting thatS2is swap robust.Thus our system cannot be of C-dimension 2 and therefore has C-dimension 3.□In this section, we will try to quantify the power of the Hong Kong government within Legco. Indeed, we are more interested in the ratio of the power of the Hong Kong government to the power of an elected member of Legco. We will consider the two most common power indices, namely, the Shapley–Shubik Index (see Shapley & Shubik (1954)) and the Bahzhaf Index (see Banzhaf (1965)).These two power indices are ordinally equivalent, and therefore rank players equally, for weakly complete games and also for larger classes of cooperative games like semi-coherent and coherent games (see Freixas (2010)). However, when these two power indices are compared, in the class of weakly complete games, with other well-known power indices, then the equivalent ranking provided by Shapley–Shubik and Banzhaf indices do not necessarily coincide with the rankings of some others well-known power indices such as the Johnston index (see Freixas, Marciniak, & Pons (2012)).For a memberk∈[opencurl]1,…,2n+1[closecurl], we defineb(k)to be the number of winning coalitions S such thatk∈SandS⧹[opencurl]k[closecurl]is losing. Then the Banzhaf Index of k is defined asBI(k)=b(k)b(1)+⋯+b(2n+1).For each1⩽j⩽2n, we have2n-1nsuch winning coalitions that contain2n+1and∑r=⌊n/2⌋+1nn-1⌊n/2⌋nrsuch winning coalitions that do not contain2n+1. Henceb(j)=opencurl]2n-1n+n-1(n-1)/22n-1nisodd,2n-1n+n-1n/22n-1-12nn/2niseven.Fork=2n+1, we haveb(2n+1)=∑r=n+12n2nr-∑r=⌊n/2⌋+1n∑s=⌊n/2⌋+1nnrns=opencurl]22n-1-122nn-(2n-1)2nisodd22n-1-122nn-2n-1-12nn/22niseven=opencurl]22n-2-122nnnisodd22n-2-122nn+2n-1nn/2-14nn/22niseven.SinceBI(j)=BI(1)for all j (1⩽j⩽2n), we shall only consider the ratio ofBI(2n+1)toBI(1)which is equal tob(2n+1)b(1).As seen in both Fig. 1, the ratio of the power of2n+1to that of any j (1⩽j⩽2n) increases in general as n increases, but the ratio when n is odd is well below when n is even. Heuristically, it is likely due to the fact that the power of2n+1is cardinally greater than that of k (i.e.2n+1≥Dk) when n is even, but this is not the case when n is odd, as shown in Proposition 1. To prove this observation for the Banzhaf Indice in Fig. 1 mathematically, we apply the Stirling’s approximation for the binomial coefficients:nk≈nk-12kek2πk. When n is odd and large, we then haveBI(2n+1)BI(1)=b(2n+1)b(1)≈π/2n(2-1)-2(2-1).While for n is even and large, we haveBI(2n+1)BI(1)=b(2n+1)b(1)≈π/2n(2-1)+2-1.Thus,BI(2n+1)BI(1)=O(n)and the gap between the two curves in Fig. 1 is about2-1+2(2-1)=1.Letπ=1⋯nπ1⋯πnbe a permutation on[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl], then there exists a unique j such that[opencurl]π1,…,πj-1[closecurl]is not a winning coalition but[opencurl]π1,…,πj[closecurl]is a winning coalition, and we writevπ=πj.For anyk∈[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl], the Shapley–Shubik Index of a member k is defined asSSI(k)=1n!|[opencurl]π:vπ=k[closecurl]|.Note that∑j=1nSSI(j)=1.Now consider the invisible representative2n+1in Legco and the permutationπ=1⋯kk+1k+2⋯2n+1π1⋯πk2n+1πk+1⋯π2n.Letr=|[opencurl]π1,…,πk[closecurl]∩[opencurl]1,…,n[closecurl]|ands=k-r=|[opencurl]π1,…,πk[closecurl]∩[opencurl]n+1,…,2n[closecurl]|.Thenvπ=2n+1if and only ifr+s=k⩾n+1but one of s and r is less than⌊n/2⌋+1, i.e., either.(i)1⩽r⩽⌊n/2⌋andn+1-r⩽s⩽n; or1⩽s⩽⌊n/2⌋andn+1-s⩽r⩽n.Note that they are two disjoint cases and have the same number of permutations. ThereforeSSI(2n+1)=2×1(2n+1)!∑r=1⌊n/2⌋∑s=n+1-rnnrns(r+s)!(2n-r-s)!=22n+1∑r=1⌊n/2⌋∑s=n+1-rnr+sr2n-r-sn-r2nn-1.We do not find any further simplifications of the last expression but numerical data leads us to make the followingConjecture 1SSI(2n+1)∼λn-1/2for some positive constantλwhen n tends to infinity (which is equivalent to saying that the double sum inSSI(2n+1)above is approximatelyλ4n).SSI(2n+1)/SSI(1)=O(n).Note that sinceSSI(j)=SSI(1)(asj=D1) for all1⩽j⩽2nand∑j=12nSSI(j)+SSI(2n+1)=1, the ratio ofSSI(2n+1)toSSI(1)equals to2nSSI(2n+1)1-SSI(2n+1). Conjecture 1 will then implySSI(2n+1)SSI(1)∼2λnand hence Conjecture 2.If Conjecture 2 is true, then we have bothSSI(2n+1)SSI(1)andBI(2n+1)BI(1)are of same order of growthO(n). Moreover, comparing Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, it seems that bothSSI(2n+1)SSI(1)andBI(2n+1)BI(1)share the same asymptotic gap behavior. Unfortunately, we cannot find an explanation of this gap behavior for the Shapley–Shubik Index.Finally, as one can see from Fig. 2, for the current Legco (n=35), the power of the Hong Kong government is almost three times that of any member in Legco asSSI(71)=0.0395andSSI(k)=0.0137fork⩽70.
