@&#ABSTRACT@&#
As a pivotal domain within envelope protein, fusion peptide (FP) plays a crucial role in pathogenicity and therapeutic intervention. Taken into account the limited FP annotations in NCBI database and absence of FP prediction software, it is urgent and desirable to develop a bioinformatics tool to predict new putative FPs (np-FPs) in retroviruses. In this work, a sequence-based FP model was proposed by combining Hidden Markov Method with similarity comparison. The classification accuracies are 91.97% and 92.31% corresponding to 10-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation. After scanning sequences without FP annotations, this model discovered 53,946 np-FPs. The statistical results on FPs or np-FPs reveal that FP is a conserved and hydrophobic domain. The FP software programmed for windows environment is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/fptool/files/?source=navbar.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Retroviruses are enveloped RNA-containing viruses including human endogenous retrovirus (HERV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) (Coffin, 1992; Rosenberg, 2010). These viruses require membrane fusion to enter host cell cytoplasm for reverse transcription (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2004). The fusion process is controlled and executed by viral envelope glycoprotein (env) (White et al., 2008a). Env is composed of a surface and trans-membrane (TM) subunits respectively mediating receptor binding and virus-cell fusion (Barnard et al., 2006). Locating at the N-terminal of TM subunit, fusion peptide (FP) represents an absolute requirement for the fusogenic function of retroviruses (Apellániz et al., 2014). Upon fusion activation, FP must insert itself obliquely into target cell membrane to disorganize locally the structure of lipid bilayer (Epand, 2003). The interaction of FP with target cell causes a formation of an intermediate pre-hairpin structure which bridges and fuses the viral and host membranes together (Apellániz et al., 2014). In contrast with targeting later steps in the retrovirus life cycle, such as reverse transcription, integration and maturation of virions, targeting membrane fusion to block retrovirus into host cells has significant advantages for therapeutic intervention (Wolf-Georg et al., 2010). For example, it contributes to reducing the risk of undesired side effects, preventing the establishment or maintenance of latent viral reservoirs and so on (Wolf-Georg et al., 2010). Consequently, the dependence of retrovirus on FP during infection process and the advantages of fusion inhibitor make FP an available and promising drug target (Wolf-Georg et al., 2010; Münch et al., 2007). However, classical database search tools are inefficient to retrieve FPs in env sequences (Table 1) and annotated FPs in online database are not sufficient for a better understanding of FP. Thus, it is of great importance to propose a computational model to predict new putative FPs (np-FPs). This proposed FP model is helpful to accelerate identification of FPs in retroviruses by reducing the sequence dataset for biochemical experiment corroboration.The main content of this thesis is arranged as follows. In Section 2, four procedures taken into account for the sequence-based FP model (Chou, 2011) will be sufficiently clarified. They are dataset construction, protein sample representation, FP prediction algorithm and proper evaluation methods. Then assessment results of FP model, FP software, predicted np-FPs and statistic hydrophobic properties about FP will be described in detail in Section 3. Eventually, validity of FP model, FP motif and evolutionary relationship about FP will be discussed in Section 4.
