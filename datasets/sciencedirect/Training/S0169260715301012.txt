Background and objectivesComputer aided analysis of mammograms has been employed by radiologists as a vital tool to increase the precision in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The efficiency of such an analysis is dependent on the employed mammogram enhancement approach; as its major role is to yield a visually improved image for radiologists.MethodsNon-linear Polynomial Filtering (NPF) framework has been explored previously as a robust approach for contrast improvement of mammographic images. This paper presents the extension of NPF framework for sharpening and edge enhancement of mammogram lesions. Proposed NPF serves to provide enhancement of edges and sharpness of the lesion region (region-of-interest) in mammograms, in a manner to minimize the dependencies on pre-selected thresholds. In the present work, Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) model has been employed for the purpose of improvement in visualization of mammograms based on Human Visual System (HVS) characteristics.ResultsThe proposed NPF filtering framework yields mammograms with significant improvement in contrast, edges as well as sharpness of the lesion region. The performance of the proposed approach has been validated using state-of-art objective evaluation measures (of mammogram enhancement) like Contrast Improvement Index (CII), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ASNR) and Combined Enhancement Measure (CEM); as well as subjective evaluation by radiologists’ opinions.ConclusionsThe proposed NPF provides a robust solution to perform noise controlled contrast as well as edge enhancement using a single filtering model. This leads to a better visualization of the fine lesion details predictive of their severity. The applicability of single filtering methodology for carrying out denoising, contrast and edge enhancement improves the worth of the overall framework.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, as lesions exist in a range of sizes rather than a single threshold value. Literature in the past has demonstrated that identification of lesion region during the first diagnosis bears a vital significance during the prognosis of breast cancer. Screening modalities would be successful if detection occurs prior to the development of micro-metastases [1,2]. Mammography has been the gold standard for breast cancer screening whereas ultrasound, MRI and nuclear medicines are being used as supplementary modalities. Although, mammography is the population screening modality, analysis of mammographic images is costly, time consuming as well as a challenging affair [3–5]. Magnification of the Region-of-Interest (ROI) at times not only blurs the lesion margins but leads to relative enhancement of the background tissues, which makes the overall analysis more complicated. Computer algorithms for pre-processing mammograms are therefore widely employed to enhance contrast and suppress noise in the background in order to improve the lesion region in mammographic images [6,7]. The accuracy in decisions related to the stages of malignancy can be critically evaluated only with the proper visualization of lesion margins. Hence, edge enhancement of the ROI during Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) of mammograms could serve as a vital alternative to accurately locate the features associated with morphology. CAD schemes aid the radiologists in detecting mammographic anomalies which are of subtle nature with greater degree of precisions; posing reduction in numerous unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions [8].Bilinear realizations of Volterra series expansions are found suitable for filtering systems with Poisson noise inputs [9,10]. Quadratic filters are sub-class of bilinear Volterra filters whose output is linearly dependent upon filter coefficients. Zhou et al. [11] used Alpha-Weighted Quadratic Filter (AWQF) for enhancement of mammograms. AWQF has been extended for edge detection by inclusion of negative powers in the quadratic filter model. This has been done to suppress the homogeneous (uniform) regions of the image while yielding an enhancement of the edge portions [12]. Wavelet based Multiresolution approaches [3] decomposes the mammographic images into sub-bands; these approaches are performance limited owing to their dependency on pre-selected thresholds [13–15]. Another category of non-linear approaches for edge enhancement of mammograms are General Adaptive Neighbourhood Image Processing (GANIP) [16], morphological filtering [17–20] and Unsharp Masking (UM) [21,22]. Different variants of UM were proposed by employing non-linear operators providing satisfactory enhancement results. But, it added to the complexity of the overall enhancement approach along with presence of some overshoots [23–25]. Recently, there are many techniques which employed hybrid combinations of the above discussed enhancement approaches (for mammograms) as in work of Anand et al. [26], Rezaee and Haddadnia [27], Lu et al. [28], Septiana et al. [29], Srivastava et al. [30] and Xinfeng and Shumin [31]. Owing to hybridization, the techniques pose severe computational loads without any note-worthy improvement in terms of edge enhancement. The performance of these techniques is severely degraded for mammograms with dense tissues.The aim of the present work is to extend the applicability of NPF for enhancement of edges and sharpness of the lesion region (ROI) in mammograms in a manner to minimize the dependencies on pre-selected thresholds. Further, the usability of single filtering methodology for carrying out denoising, contrast and edge enhancement improves the versatility of the overall approach. It has been demonstrated during simulations that the outcomes of the objective evaluation of mammograms (enhanced using the proposed NPF) are in due coherence with that of analysis by radiologists.
