@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a new image segmentation method based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and outlier rejection combined with level set is proposed. A traditional approach to the segmentation of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images is the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The membership function of this conventional algorithm is sensitive to the outlier and does not integrate the spatial information in the image. The algorithm is very sensitive to noise and in-homogeneities in the image, moreover, it depends on cluster centers initialization. To improve the outlier rejection and to reduce the noise sensitivity of conventional FCM clustering algorithm, a novel extended FCM algorithm for image segmentation is presented. In general, in the FCM algorithm the initial cluster centers are chosen randomly, with the help of PSO algorithm the clusters centers are chosen optimally. Our algorithm takes also into consideration the spatial neighborhood information. These a priori are used in the cost function to be optimized. For MR images, the resulting fuzzy clustering is used to set the initial level set contour. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used for the diagnosis of various diseases [1,2]. Several classification techniques are used for brain MR image segmentation among the most well known: thresholding [3] and edge detection [4]. Noise affects the performance of these techniques and thus, leads to incorrect boundaries detection and under or over-segmentation. These image segmentation methods have led to region growing algorithms by considering the homogeneity and connectivity criteria [5]. Region growing algorithms can robustly identify only well-defined regions. Knowing that the above-mentioned techniques are generally used for relatively simple structures, clustering methods are applied for complex data. In clustering, we use homogeneity criteria for grouping data. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm [6,7] is the typical clustering method used in image segmentation.Many modifications of the FCM algorithm have been proposed such as kernel possibilistic c-means (KPCM) [8], intuitionistic FCM [9]. To alleviate the effects of noise, we can cite noisy clustering (NC) [10], FCM with spatial constraints [11], FCM_S1 [12], robust FCM (RFCM) [7] and outlier rejection FCM (ORFCM) [13]. Many researchers proposed to use metaheuristics for optimizing the FCM parameters by means of genetic algorithm [14], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [15]. All these algorithms suffer from the cluster centers initialization problem. Bad initialization can lead to a locally optimum solution. To overcome this problem, Zhang et al. [16] proposed to use PSO algorithm to initialize the cluster centers.The proposed improved algorithm (IKPCM), inspired by the KPCM clustering algorithm, takes into account many sides (initialization step, distance metric, spatial information and outlier rejection) unlike the existing methods. In the existing literature, the improvement of FCM algorithm applied to image segmentation concerns generally only one side, which is often not enough to yield satisfactory results. Therefore, in our method, we integrate, in a single algorithm, several improvements that we deem to be relevant. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives better segmentation results. For medical images, the clusters boundaries found by the use of IKPCM are used as initial contours for the level set.This paper is organized as follows; Section 2 is a background concept of the FCM and its limitations. The implementation of the proposed algorithm is described in Section 3. In Section 4, we present the performance of the proposed algorithm using synthetic images, simulated and real MR brain images. Finally, a conclusion and future works are given in Section 5.
