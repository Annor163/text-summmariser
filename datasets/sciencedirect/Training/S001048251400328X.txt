Graphical abstractMuscle fibre contractions is induced by action potentials which are generated at the innervation zone (IZ), propagate along the muscle fibres and extinguish at the tendon endings. Surface EMG reflects this bioelectrical activity of the muscle fibres. This paper proposes an innovative method which fits 2D high density surface EMG to a model describing production and flow, estimating the generation/extinction and propagation of action potentials. Two representative examples of applications are shown in Fig. 1. The method is real time, opening new possible applications: it investigates automatically muscle anatomy and activity, supporting the study of dynamic contractions, the control of prosthesis or the development of a biofeedback; moreover, it can support the automatic selection the optimal locations of the electrodes (far from IZ and tendons) from which EMG indexes can be reliably estimated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Surface electromyogram (EMG) is the potential recorded over the skin surface resulting from the generation, propagation and extinction of action potentials at the neuromuscular junction, along the muscle fibres and at the tendon endings, respectively. High density surface EMG has been proposed to investigate the muscle activity on a wide spatial area with a good selectivity [1] and is finding many applications, e.g. in clinics [2–4], basic physiology [5], ergonomics [6] and sport science [7].Surface EMG recorded using two dimensional (2D) grids of electrodes may be considered as a set of images, which contain information about generation, propagation and extinction of the action potentials [1]. When neglecting generation and extinction, the propagation of action potentials can be described as a flow. Optical flow algorithms have been introduced to estimate the motion of objects in video-clips from a fixed camera or the relative motion of the observer with respect to the scene. Different applications were proposed, e.g. in machine vision [8], in precipitation forecasting [9,10], in the investigation of moving images within the scenes from a television signal [11], in robotics (to incorporate image processing techniques to the control of navigation, for object detection and tracking, image dominant plane extraction, movement detection and visual odometry [12,13]) and in the control of micro air vehicles [14]. Classical methods can estimate the optical flow from a couple of subsequent images [15–17]. Some multi-frame techniques were also introduced, in order to enhance robustness to noise and to improve the discriminating capabilities of the algorithm [18,19]. A classical technique [15] was applied also to surface EMG [20], to investigate the propagation of the action potentials. The flow was estimated using an iterative algorithm, introducing different pairs of EMG maps in each iteration, spanning about 1s of acquisition. The estimated flow was used to investigate the position of the innervation zone (IZ), even though generation is implicated there.A model describing also generation and extinction, in addition to propagation, was introduced in [21] to study the dynamics of rainy clouds from radar images. A multi-frame technique was applied (also because of the additional unknowns to be estimated). The method was tested on synthetic signals, showing its feasibility for the accurate estimation of the direction and velocity of the motion of clouds and their generation or depletion. Such a method was adapted here to surface EMG from 2D electrode grids, with the aim of extracting information on muscle anatomy and action potential propagation. Care was devoted to the reduction of the computational cost, in order to extract the information in real time.The automatic investigation of the anatomy of the muscle fibres under the electrodes is useful per se, but also in order to counteract for possible variations of the fibre orientation or IZ and tendon shift under the electrodes (especially in dynamic conditions). Indeed, the algorithm could be used as a pre-processing step to properly select the channels for applying other methods for information extraction (e.g., for amplitude or spectral content estimation [22]). Moreover, as the method is real time, it could be embedded into a biofeedback.Estimating EMG generation/extinction and flow is challenging for many reasons. The sampling in space is not so dense as in the case of radar or movie images and the recorded information is reduced by the blurring induced by the volume conductor [23]. Moreover, many physiological or technical sources of noise can be present, including tissue inhomogeneity [24,25], non-parallel muscle fibres [26], fibres going deep in the muscle [27], variations in the thickness of the tissues or other possible sources of inhomogeneity or anisotropy [28,29] or detection problems [30]. Moreover, even the generation and extinction of action potentials do not reflect in a simple appearing or disappearing of a waveform in the recorded EMG, but they involve important shape variations of the potential, which depend on the location of the active fibre [28,29].In this paper, the method for optical flow and source estimation is presented and tested on simulations of surface EMG from finite length fibres. The parameters of the model (velocity flow and source term) were estimated from EMG maps simulated as recorded from different electrode grids and using a different sampling rate. Examples of applications to muscles with non-parallel fibres are also shown. Potentialities of the method in providing information about the direction of the muscle fibres, the location of generation and extinction sites (IZ and tendon endings) and the velocity of propagation of the action potentials are shown. New potential real time applications are also discussed.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper proposes and tests in simulation an innovative method to process high density surface EMG to estimate the generation, extinction and propagation of muscle fibre action potentials. This information could be of great interest to investigate the muscle anatomy, to characterize the muscle activity and to select automatically the channels from which to extract reliable EMG indexes. The proposed algorithm is real time, opening new important potential applications, as in the study of dynamic contractions (where optimal channels for information extraction could be identified as the muscle moves under the skin), in the control of a prosthesis (the information on fibre direction and IZ location could be useful to identify a desired movement) or in the design of a rehabilitation programme based on a biofeedback (indicating to the subject how the muscle is moving under the skin).The author has no conflict of interest concerning the publication of this work.
