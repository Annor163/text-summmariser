BackgroundDesign patterns, in the context of software development and ontologies, provide generalized approaches and guidance to solving commonly occurring problems, or addressing common situations typically informed by intuition, heuristics and experience. While the biomedical literature contains broad coverage of specific phenotype algorithm implementations, no work to date has attempted to generalize common approaches into design patterns, which may then be distributed to the informatics community to efficiently develop more accurate phenotype algorithms.MethodsUsing phenotyping algorithms stored in the Phenotype KnowledgeBase (PheKB), we conducted an independent iterative review to identify recurrent elements within the algorithm definitions. We extracted and generalized recurrent elements in these algorithms into candidate patterns. The authors then assessed the candidate patterns for validity by group consensus, and annotated them with attributes.ResultsA total of 24 electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) phenotypes available in PheKB as of 1/25/2013 were downloaded and reviewed. From these, a total of 21 phenotyping patterns were identified, which are available as an online data supplement.ConclusionsRepeatable patterns within phenotyping algorithms exist, and when codified and cataloged may help to educate both experienced and novice algorithm developers. The dissemination and application of these patterns has the potential to decrease the time to develop algorithms, while improving portability and accuracy.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Electronic health records (EHRs) have been shown to be a valuable source of information for biomedical research, including the definition and identification of clinical phenotypes [1–5]. The increasing use of EHRs [6,7] has resulted in large quantities of data available for secondary purposes such as research. In order to better handle this growing source of data, we need to improve methods and approaches to phenotype more efficiently.The electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network has been a leader in the development of phenotype algorithms based on EHR data. In addition to the work done through eMERGE for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [8–15], there are additional examples of electronic algorithms to mine EHRs for identifying diseases for biomedical research and clinical care [16–20] disease surveillance [21], pharmacovigilance [22], as well as for decision support [23]. These studies have provided some guidance on dealing with the challenges of using EHR and claims data [2,20,24–26]. This guidance has often been in the context of a single algorithm, although more recent work has begun to address the broader challenges of using EHR data for phenotyping [1,27]. Additionally, research is being conducted to identify how electronic phenotype algorithms may be represented and made more portable across disparate EHRs [28,29], which has the potential to automate approaches to handle the complexities and nuances of EHR data.A major goal of the current phase of eMERGE is to improve the ease and speed of developing new phenotype definitions. No known work to date, however, has attempted to broadly classify challenges and solutions to using EHR data for the development of electronic phenotype algorithms, or demonstrated an approach to widely disseminate the findings. This knowledge could potentially reduce the time to develop phenotype algorithms, improve portability to other sites and even accuracy by describing experiences developing other algorithms. The primary goal of this paper is to apply lessons from prior work in software design patterns to the problem of defining and disseminating EHR-based phenotype algorithms.In software engineering, the use of design patterns are frequently used to generate solutions to common problems or scenarios [30]. These patterns are free from any technical implementation details, such as programming language or database platform. Design patterns are not applicable only in the domain of software development. They have roots in architecture [31], and have recently been applied to the development of ontologies [32,33] and health information technology (HIT) solutions [34,35]. Even though design patterns are used in multiple domains, they share similar constructs that form a basis of overall pattern languages [36]. Generally, design patterns provide: (1) a description of a scenario or problem that exists and that the pattern may address; (2) a template for a solution; and, (3) considerations for when to apply the pattern, or what its implications may be [30,31,36]. Design patterns are not intended to capture every possible pattern that may occur in the target domain; rather, they represent best practices and common approaches to solving a problem. In practice, they may be derived from intuition, heuristics and experience.In order to more widely disseminate solutions to common problems and scenarios found in the development of electronic phenotype algorithms, we propose the creation of “EHR-driven phenotype extraction design patterns”—logical patterns recurring frequently in phenotyping algorithms that are EHR and technology agnostic. This paper presents an initial catalog of such patterns from experiences within the eMERGE network.
