High-speed video analysis for kink formation in a bond wire looping

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
An experimental study on bond wire looping by using high-speed video analysis was presented.The video data shows that capillary velocity, trajectory position and the position of kinks.The toolâ€™s transverse move in its zigzag motion phase is a necessary step to create kinks.Capillary nozzle applies small and localized moment to the segment of fresh wire to create a new kink.The residual curvature of kinks would be major target for wire looping design.
