@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the present study, a new soft computing framework is developed for solving nanofluidic problems based on fluid flow and heat transfer of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) along a flat plate with Navier slip boundary with the help of artificial neural networks (ANNs), Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Interior-Point Algorithm (IPA), and hybridized approach GA-IPA. Original PDEs associated with the problem are transformed into system of nonlinear ODEs using similarity transformation. Mathematical model of transformed system is constructed by exploiting the strength of universal function approximation ability of ANNs and an unsupervised error function is formulated for the system in a least mean square sense. Learning of the design variable of the networks is carried out with GAs supported with IPA for rapid local convergence. The design scheme is applied to solve number of variants by taking water, engine oil, and kerosene oil as a base fluids mixed with different concentrations of MWCNTs. The reliability and effectiveness of the design scheme is measured with the help of results of statistical analysis based on sufficient large number of independent runs of the algorithms rather than single successful run. The comparative studies of the proposed solution are made with standard numerical results in order to establish the correctness of the given scheme.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Heat transfer fluids (HTFs) having appropriate thermal conductivity properties are considered to be fundamental in microelectronics cooling, chemical production, refrigerator and air-conditioning, transportation, and many other applications [1–3]. Increase in the thermal conductivity of these fluids is desired to improve heat transfer rate that is achieved usually with the additions of nanoparticles. Fluid flow and heat transfer problems involving nanoparticles have been investigated by many researchers due to their significant impact on industrial applications, including extrusion of plastic, paper production, metal spinning, wire drawing, glass blowing, hot rolling, manufacture of rubber sheet, polymer engineering, cooling of metallic sheets, and crystal growing [3–8].In the class of nanofluids, the use of cylindrical multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is more often due to their unique characteristic. The discovery of MWCNTs is associated with Japanese physicist S. Iijima during 1990s, in his work related to the insoluble soot of arc-burned graphite rods [9]. Since then, these carbon nanotubes (CNTs) gained utmost attention as a valuable nanomaterial with extensive applications [10,11]. CNT is given such a specific name due to their tube type shape and formulation with carbon. The MWCNTs are specific type of CNTs that are based on collection of numerous cylinders, which are separated by 0.35nm [12]. These nanoparticles have wide range of characteristics, such as smooth structure plane on nanoscale, light weight, extraordinary strength to resist a temperature upto 2000°C, and are considered to be one of the strongest and stiffest material discovered due to their properties of high tensile strength and elastic modulus [13–15]. Thermal and electrical conductivity properties of MWCNTs are based on reinforced composites [16,17], which are exceptional and that enable their facile and nondestructive characterization. MWCNTs arise in many studies such as enhancement of electrochemically solid-phase microextraction based on molecularly imprinted MWCNTs composite coating [18], use the roots of kiwi fruit samples for development of molecularly imprinted polymers based on MWCNTs [19], formulation of chitosan and cellulose nanocrystals using layer-by-layer assembled films of MWCNTs [20], hybrid nonoparticles consist of gold, and MWCNTs are used for amplified electrochemical detection of protein kinase activity [21], reliable extinction coefficient of aqueous nanofluids based on MWCNTs [22] and MWCNTs composite electrode used in rechargeable batteries [23], etc. Due to their utmost importance of MWCNTs in many fields, research community attracted to develop analytical and numerical solvers for solving fluid mechanics problems involving these nanoparticles mixed with different type base fluids [24–26]. However, beside the well-established strength of stochastic numerical solver, these artificial intelligence procedures have not been exploited for solving nanofluid dynamics problems involving MWCNTs.The stochastic numerical solvers based on feed-forward artificial neural networks (FF-ANNs) optimized with evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms, which have been applied immensely to solve a variety of linear/nonlinear initial value problems (IVPs) and boundary value problems (BVPs) of differential equations [27,28]. For example, these solvers are used for BVPs of pantograph functional differential equation [29], nonlinear singular systems associated with Emden–Flower equations [30], solving single variable nonlinear algebraic, and transcendental equations [31], strong nonlinear problem of first Painlevé transcendent [32–35], plasma physics problem associated with Toresch's BVPs [35,36], computational fluid mechanics problems models with nonlinear Jeffery–Hamel flow equation in the presence of high magnetic field [37,38], nonlinear Riccati system represented with fractional differential equations (FDEs) [39,40], and homogeneous and nonhomogeneous IVPs of Bagley–Torvik FDEs [41]. Recently, BVPs of thin film flow of third grade fluid [42], fuel ignition model of combustion theory given by nonlinear one-dimensional Bratu's BVPs [43,44], and transformed problems of two-dimensional nonlinear Bratu's equations are other illustrative potential application of these schemes [45–47]. The capability of ANNs are also applied extensively in nanotechnology problems of computational fluid dynamics, such as determination of viscosity in water-TiO2 nanofluid [49], prediction of heat transfer due to presence of copper—water nanofluid [50], prediction of unsteady mixed convection over circular cylinder in the presence of nanofluid [51], analysis of laminar mixed convection in an inclined square lid-driven cavity with a nanofluid [52], and prediction of thermal gradient in an air channel with presence of electrostatic field [53]. Additionally a good source of reference for ANNs applications to nanotechnology can be seen in book [54]. In all these applications soft computing techniques utilized supervised neural network optimized with local search methodologies for solving governing mathematical models for nanofluidic problems involving nanoparticles based on copper, aluminum gold, silver, etc but not a single study is available in which MWCNTs based nanofluidic problems solved by ANNs. MWCNTs based nanofluidic problems look a promising area to be explored with soft computing approaches. These are motivation factor for authors to investigate in stochastic techniques and design an alternate, accurate, and reliable computing platform for fluid mechanics problems containing MWCNTs.In this article, partial differential equations (PDEs) representing fluid flow and heat transfer problem in case of flat plate with Navier slip boundary conditions involving MWCNTs are transformed into system that consists of two nonlinear ODEs of order upto three and these transformed equations are solved by using FF-ANNs, GAs, and IPAs. The FF-ANNs models of differential equations are used to construct the fitness function and learning of weights of these networks is carried out with GAs, as a global search operator, hybrid with IPA for viable local convergence. The proposed scheme is tested on number of scenarios for nanofluid dynamics by taking different base fluids and concentrations of multi-walled CNTs. The comparative study of the proposed solution is made with the result of fully explicit Runge–Kutta state of art numerical solvers in MATHEMATICA software package.Considering a two-dimensional flow over a flat plate with heat transfer involving nanofluids that consist of water, kerosene oil (KO), or engine oil (EO) as a base fluid mixed with different concentrations of MWCNTs. Fluid flow is considered to be laminar, steady, and incompressible so that it has constant density. Additionally, uniform heat flux is assumed on a plate surface. Boundary layer problem for these scenarios can be written with governing mathematical relations base on PDEs as: [55](1)∂u∂x=−∂v∂yu∂u∂x+v∂v∂y=vnf∂2u∂y2u∂T∂x+v∂T∂y=αnf∂2T∂y2Here, u and v are representing the velocity profile of the fluid along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, T represents temperature, vnfis the effective kinematic viscosity, while αnfis the thermal diffusivity. The general characteristic of nanofluids may be given in terms of the properties of the base fluid, and solid volume fraction of MWCNTs, and given as follows:(2)ρnf=(1−ϕ)ρf+ϕρMWCNT,μnf=μf(1−ϕ)−2.5(ρcp)nf=ϕ(ρcp)MWCNT+(1−ϕ)(ρcp)fvnf=μnfρnf,αnf=knf(ρcp)nfHere, knfstands for the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid, (ρcp)nf, and ϕ are representing the heat capacity and solid volume fraction of fluid with nanoparticles, respectively. Considering the hydrodynamic and thermal properties the boundary conditions are written as:(3)v=0,u=γ∂u/∂y,−k∂T/∂y=qw,aty=0u→U∞,T→T∞,asy→∞,here γ represents the slip parameter and free steam velocity is given by U∞.Using the following similarity transform for (1) to (3) as:(4)ψ=vfRexfη,η=yxRex,θη=T−T∞qwx/kfRexHere, in term of free stream velocity and the kinematic viscosity of the base fluid, the expressionRex=U∞x/vfis the relation of Reynolds number, while the stream function Ψ is given asu=∂ψ/∂yandv=−∂ψ/∂x. Using the similarity variables (4), PDEs given in (1) reduce to the following nonlinear systems based on two ODEs while the detail derivation can be seen in [55].(5)f‴+12(1−ϕ)2.5(1−ϕ+ϕρMWCNT/ρf)ff″=0(6)θ''+12prkfknf1−ϕ+ϕρcpMWCNT/ρcpffθ'−f'θ=0(7)Withboundaryconditionf(0)=0,f'(0)=β(1−ϕ)−2.5,θ−(0)=−kknf−1ff'→1,θ→0,asη→∞The proposed design scheme consists of two parts; the unsupervised ANNs mathematical modeling for the system of differential equations given in (5) to (7) and optimization procedure adopted for finding the desired weights of these networks.Neural networks mathematical modelingThe mathematical modeling of the nonlinear system of equations is constructed in two phases; first the development of ANNs architecture for the solutions and their respective derivatives, while in second phase formulation of the merit/fitness/objective function for the system by using these ANNs in an unsupervised manner is presented.The differential equation ANN models for the solutions and respectively nth derivatives are given below in terms of input, hidden, and output layers as a continuous mapping.yˆ(η)=∑j=1mφjg(wjη+bj),yˆ(n)(η)=∑j=1mφjg(n)(wjη+bj),where,W=ϕ,w,b=φ1,φ2,..,φm,w1,w2,…,wm,b1,b2,…,bmare the unknown weight vectors, m is number of neurons, g(x) is the activation functions and it is given as:g(x)=11+e−x,Log−Sigmoide−x2,RadialBaseex,ExponentialUsing above relation mathematical model of ODEs in (5) and (6) are derived with the strength of approximation theory based on feed-forward ANN, in the form of following continuous mapping for the solutions {f(η), θ(η)} and their derivatives are given by:(8)fˆ(η)=∑j=1mφ1,jg(w1,jη+b1,j),θˆ(η)=∑j=1mφ2,jg(w2,jη+b2,j)f′ˆ(η)=∑j=1mφ1,jg′(w1,jη+b1,j),θˆ′(η)=∑j=1mφ2,jg′w2,jη+b2,jfˆ″η=∑j=1mφ1,jg″w1,jη+bi,θˆ″(η)=∑j=1mφ2,jg″w2,jη+b2,j⋮⋮fˆnη=∑j=1Mφ1,jg(n)w1,jη+bi,θˆ(n)(η)=∑j=1Mφ2,jg(n)w2,jη+b2,jThe set of ANNs given in (8) using log-sigmoid function g(x)=1/(1+e-x) are given in updated form for the solution f(η) and its derivatives as:(9)fˆ(η)=∑j=1mφ1,jw1,j1/1+e−w1,jη+b1,j,fˆ′η=∑j=1mφ1,jw1−je−w1,jη+β1,j/1+e−w1,jη+b1,j2,fˆ″η=∑j=1mφ1−jw1−j22e−2w1,jη+b1,j1+e−w1,jη+b1,j3−e−w1,jη+b1,j1+e−w1,jη+b1,j2⋮Similarly, updated networks for θ(η) and its derivatives are given by:(10)θˆ(η)=∑j=1mφ2,jw2,j1/1+e−w2,jη+b2,j,θ′ˆη=∑j=1mφ2,jw2−je−w2,jη+b2,j/1+e−w2,jη+b2,j2,θ″ˆη=∑j=1mφ2−jw2−j22e−2w2,jη+b2,j1+e−w2,jη+b2,j3−e−w2,jη+b2,j1+e−w2,jη+b2,j2⋮The appropriate combinations of ANNs given in a set of Eqs. (9) and (10) are used to develop the mathematical model for system of Eqs. (5–7) as shown in Fig. 1in terms of input, output and hidden layers.In order to solve the system of Eqs. (5–7) an unsupervised error or fitness function is formulated based on sum of three mean square errors as:(11)e=e1+e2+e3where e1 and e2 are error functions associated with two ODEs of the nonlinear system and are given as:(12)e1=1N∑m=1Nf‴ˆm+0.51−φ2.51−φ+φρMWCNT/ρffˆmf″ˆm2,e2=1N∑m=1Nθ″ˆm+0.5kfknfpr1−φ+φρcpMWCNT/ρcpffˆmθ′ˆm−f′ˆmθˆm2,whereN=1/h,fˆm=fˆηm,θˆm=θˆηm,andηm=mh.Similarly, e3 is the error function associated with initial and boundary conditions of ODEs system and is formulated as:e3=15fˆ02+fˆ′0−β1−φ−2.52+θ′ˆ0+kf/knf2+fˆ′N−12+θˆN2.The solution of systems of Eqs. (5–7) can be found with availability of appropriate weights for ANN models such that fitness function e approaches zero, i.e., e→0, then approximate solutions approaches the desired solution of the systems, i.e.,fˆ(η),θˆ(η)→f(η),θ(η).Procedure for obtaining the appropriate parameters of fitness function e (11) is presented here based on hybrid evolutionary computing approach based on genetic algorithms supported with interior-point algorithms (GA-IPA).Genetic algorithms (GAs) is considered to be most viable method in the class of evolutionary computation technique (ECT). GAs are developed on the basis of mathematical model of natural evolution processes. Holland was pioneer to introduce GAs in his research studies to mimic a simple picture of natural selection [56]. GAs is incorporated to find the candidate solutions of the optimization problems by explorations and exploitations of whole search space and widely used in diverse fields of engineering and sciences. The standard working process of GAs is carried out mainly with three operators, i.e., selection, crossover, and mutation. GAs is a well-established, competent and reliable global search technique for finding the solution linear and nonlinear systems arises in many fields. Few recent applications of GAs includes optimization of rear end in a simplified car model [57], design of automatic dynamic penalization method for constraint handling [58] design of Phosphor distribution optimizations to decrease the junction temperature in while pc-LEDs [59], and optimization of a blade stiffened composite panel [60], etc.The performance of the GAs in term of efficient tuning of adaptive parameter is slow down considerably as number of iterations increase and usually to overcome this aspect of the algorithm hybridization with rapid local search technique is incorporated. A variety of local search method has been developed by the research community including active-set, sequential quadratic programming, interior-point, Nelder–Mead, Levenberg–Marquart algorithms, etc. All these schemes have their own intrinsic worth, strength, applicability, and limitation in different applications, but in this study interior-point algorithm (IPA) is used as a viable method for hybridization with GAs due to its extensive used in recent articles like optimum zero-forcing beamforming [61], optimum energy consumption in high voltage alternating current (HVAC) systems [62], optimization of frictionless contact mechanics problems [63], and large-scale simulation of granular material [64], etc.The hybrid approach GA-IPA is used for training of design parameter of the ANNs. For both GA and IPAs built-in software packages available in MATLAB optimization toolbox are incorporated with setting of the parameters as listed in Tables 1 and 2. The optimization procedure is sensitive to the parameter and small change in the values may results into premature convergence of the algorithm. The values of the parameters are set with care, after a lot of numerical experimentations, experience, and knowledge of the problem. The overall procedure of the design scheme is given in Fig. 2to solve the problem while the necessary details of the procedural steps are given below:Step 1:Program and tool initialization of GAs:chromosomes or individuals are created with randomly generated bounded real values and set of these individuals are used to generate initial population. The number of elements or genes in each chromosome is equal to the number of unknown weights in unsupervised ANNs of the problem. Mathematically, the chromosome is represented as:W=φ1,w1,b1,φ2,w2,b2=φ1,1,φ1,2,..,φ1,m,w1,1,w1,2,...,w1,m,b1,1,b1,2,...,b1,m,φ2,1,φ2,2,...,φ2,m,w2,1,w2,2,...,w2,m,b2,1,b2,2,...,b2,mwhere m is a number to represent the neurons in the ANNs. The necessary settings of program parameters GAs are listed in Table 1. Initialization the settings for GA program and tool using built-in function ‘gaoptimset’ in MATLAB optimization toolbox and these parameters are listed in Table 1.Step 2:Calculate Fitness:determine the value of the fitness in case of each chromosome of the population using Eq. (11) and consequently Eqs. (12–13).Step 3:Termination: terminate the iterative process of updating of weights if any of the following predefined criterion achieved.•The values of fitness achieved, i.e., ‘FitnessLimit’ ≤ 10−12.Total number of cycles completed, i.e., ‘generation’=150Any value for function tolerance (TolFun), constraints tolerance (TolCon), TolFun, maximum function evaluation (MaxFunEvals), number of generation over, which cumulative change in fitness value is less than Tolfun, i.e., (StallGenLimit), is achieved as listed in Table 1.If termination criteria satisfy, then go to step 6 otherwise continue.Step 4:Ranking:Rank each individual of the population based on value of fitness e using Eq. (11).Step 5:Reproduction:reproduce the next generation population with the help of genetic operators based on crossover, selection and mutation function by invoking the respective routine as listed in Table 1. Elitism operation is also in reproduction mechanism.Go to step 2.Step 6:Storage-1:store the value of parameters of global best individual, its fitness, number of generations taken, maximum number of function evaluations, and time taken for this run of GA.Step 7:Hybridization:an efficient local search based on interior-point algorithm (IPA) is used for refinement of the results by invoking MATLAB built in routine for constraints optimization problems, i.e., ‘fmincon’. The procedural steps of IPA are given below:a)Program and Tool Initialization IPA: initial weights of IPA are the global best individual of GAs. Bounds, declarations and initialized the tool function ‘optimset’ with settings as listed in Table 2.Calculate Fitness: calculate the value of fitness e using Eq. (11).Termination Criteria: terminate the iterative process of updating adaptive parameter of ANNs, if any of the following predefine criteria fulfilled•Number of iterations completed.Value for TolFun, MaxFunEvals, X-tolerance (TolX), and TolCon is achieved as listed in Table 2.If termination criteria satisfy, then go to step 8.Updating of weights: step increment in IPA procedure is made and go to step 8(b).Step 8:Storage-2: store the values for the weight vectors, fitness, generations, maximum number of function evaluation, and execution time taken for this run of GA-IPA.Step 9:Statistical Analysis: repeat the procedure form step 1 to step 8 for sufficient large number of independent runs of hybrid scheme GA-IPA for training of weights for the ANNs in order to draw effective and reliable inference about the accuracy and convergence.The results of numerical simulations with proposed design method are presented for three problems of fluid flow and heat transfer of MWCNTs along a flat plate with and without Navier slip conditions, i.e., for β=0, 1 and 2. The variants of each problem are evaluated by taking different base fluids, i.e., water, kerosene oil (KO) and engine oil (EO), containing various concentrations of MWCNTs. For low Reynolds number the viscous forces are dominants, which results in consistent accuracy and stability for each case of all three problems while for high Reynolds number the viscous forcing are diminishing and flow become turbulent for, which generally no stability as well as accuracy is guarantee by the algorithm.The comparative studies of proposed results with reference numerical solution based on fully explicit Runge–Kutta (RK) method are also given in term of numerical and graphical illustrations in number of tables and figures. Simulations and results are given only for the proposed design method based on ANN optimized with GA-IPA, while the results with other soft computing techniques such as simulated annealing (SA), pattern search (PS), GAs hybrid with SA (GA-SA), GA hybrid with PS (GA-PS), SA hybrid with IPA (SA-IPA), and PS hybrid with IPA (PS-IPA) are generally found inferior from GA-IPA [35,36]. Therefore, for concise representation of experimental results, ANNs are optimized with the help of GA-IPA only in this study.In this study, three cases are taken for system of ODEs given in Eqs. (5–7) based on different base fluids involving six concentrations of MWCNT i.e., Case 1: water as base fluid with ϕ=0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16, and 0.2 for β=0 [48], Case 2: KO as base fluid with ϕ=0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16, and 0.2 for β=0 [48], Case 3: EO as base fluid with ϕ=0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16, and 0.2 for β=0 [48]. The derived equation by taking ϕ=0.08 for all three cases along with boundary condition are written, respectively, as:(13)f‴+0.4232ff″=0,θ″+0.0014fθ′−f′θ=0f(0)=0,f′(0)=0,θ′(0)=−0.00048,f′(1)=1,θ(1)=0,(14)f‴+0.4347ff″=0,θ″+0.0013fθ′−f′θ=0f(0)=0,f′(0)=0,θ′(0)=−0.00013,f′(1)=1,θ(1)=0,(15)f‴+0.4287ff″=0,θ″+0.3957fθ′−f′θ=0f(0)=0,f′(0)=0,θ′(0)=−0.000125,f′(1)=1,θ(1)=0,Similarly, the systems of ODEs are derived for each variant of all three cases. The exact solution is not known for these nonlinear systems, therefore, the numerical solution is calculated with the help of built-in routines of MATHEMATICA based on RK method for each case and these results are used for reference to compare the performance of proposed solutions.The design methodology is applied as per procedure and parameter settings listed in Tables 1 and 2 of last section. The inputs of the training set are taken between η ϵ [0,1] with a step of 0.1 i.e., K=10, therefore, the fitness functions e are formulated in case of MWCNT concentration of ϕ=0.08, for water, KO, and EO base fluids, respectively, as:(16)eH2O+ϕ=110∑m=110f‴ˆm+0.4232fˆmf″ˆm+110∑m=110θ″ˆm+0.0014fˆmθ′ˆm−f′ˆmθˆm+15fˆ0+f′ˆ0+θ′ˆ0+(f′ˆ10−1)+θˆ10(17)eKO+ϕ=110∑m=110f‴ˆm+0.4347fˆmf″ˆm+110∑m=110θ″ˆm+0.0013fˆmθ′ˆm−f′ˆmθˆm+15fˆ0+f′ˆ0+θ′ˆ0+(f′ˆ10−1)+θˆ10(18)eEO+ϕ=110∑m=110f‴ˆm+0.4287fˆmf″ˆm+110∑m=110θ″ˆm+0.3957fˆmθ′ˆm−f′ˆmθˆm+15fˆ0+f′ˆ0+θ′ˆ0+(f′ˆ10−1)+θˆ10Intention here is to find the appropriate weights for neural networks such that fitness functions as given in Eqs. (16–18) approach zero then the approximate solutions approach the desired solution of the systems. The training of weights vector for the neural networks is performed with the help of hybrid computing approach GA-IPA using the program and tools settings as listed in Tables 1 and 2. One set of trained weights vector forfˆ(η)andθˆ(η)for each variation of case 1 of the study is shown graphically in Fig. 3.Similarly, these weights are obtained of two other cases of the problem. These weights are used in first equation of set (9) to determine the proposed solution.

The reference numerical solutions with RK method are also plotted in Fig. 4 for the same inputs. The proposed results are overlapping the reference solutions. In order to determine the level of accuracy achieved by the proposed scheme, the values of absolute error (AE) for all six variations of each case of the problem are shown in Fig. 5. The small values of AEs are found in each variation of case study or β=0. The velocity profile for the flow in case of positionfˆ(η)and velocityfˆ′(η)in three dimensional graphical illustrations is shown in Fig. 6for each case of base fluids water, KO, and EO.

values of AE for all six variations of MWCNTs mixed with three types of base fluids are plotted in Fig. 8and it is seen that very small values of AEs are obtained for each scenario of this case study as well.Concrete inferences on the performance of the algorithm in term of reliability and effectiveness are drawn on the basis of results of statistical analysis based on sufficient large number of independent run rather than single successful runs of the algorithm. The inferences on the basis of values of fitness achieved, mean absolute error (MAE), Global MAE (GMAE), mean execution time (MET), mean generations (MGen), mean of maximum number of function evaluations (MMNFE), and their standard deviation (SD) are presented for the proposed scheme in this section.The accuracy of design methodology is measured on the basis of values of statistical operators, i.e., mean, SD, and minimum (MIN) values of AE form reference numerical solutions for both velocity profilefrefηand temperature distributionθrefηfor all three variants of nonlinear system given in (5–7). Results are determined using neural networks optimized with GA-IPA on hundred independent runs for ϕ=0, 0.08, and 0.2 in case of H2O, KO, and EO base fluids for all three case studies, i.e., β=0, 1, and 2, The results are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4for|frefη−fˆη|and|θrefη−θˆη|, respectively. No noticeable difference is observed in the MIN values for velocity profile and temperature distributions by change of MWCNT concentrations for each base fluids, however, the best results are obtained in case of base fluid H2O, while the results of base fluid KO have better from EO. The same trend is follows for the mean values as well. With change in the value of Navier slip parameters, i.e., β=0, 1, and 2, the slight decreased in accuracy is observed for each case of all three problems; however, this effect is more evident in case of EO used as a base fluid.The accuracy and convergence of the proposed technique is further examined based on the values of fitness e and MAE for hundred independent runs for the optimization on ANNs with GA-IPA and results are plotted in Fig. 9for fitness, while the values of MAEs are given in Figs. 10 and 11for velocity profilefˆ(η)and temperature distributionθˆη, respectively. The results are shown in the plots on semi-log scale in order to observe the small variations. It is seen for the graphically illustrations that with better achievement of fitness, the corresponding values of MAE are also better, i.e., greater will be the accuracy of the algorithm. It is inferred that the values of velocity profilefˆ(η)and temperature distributionθˆηare consistently overlapping the reference numerical solution in each variant of all three case studies, however, the most accurate results are obtained in case of all three MWCNT concentrations ϕ=0, 0.08, and 0.2 mixed with water than the rest of scenarios. Moreover, relatively better accuracy is achieved in case of KO used as a base fluid than that of EO. Additionally, reduced level of accuracy upto two decimal place is observed for all variations of MWCNT mix with EO for relatively bigger value of slip parameters, i.e., β=2, while the cases for water and KO, six to seven decimal places of precision is achieved for β=2 as well.The reliability of the proposed scheme is determined on the basis of percentage convergent runs of the algorithm on predefined criteria of fitness ɛ and MAE values. Results of convergence performance in case of hundred independent executions for the design scheme are listed in Tables 5 and 6based on fitness and MAE values for bothfˆ(η)andθˆ(η), respectively. It is seen that based on criteria, i.e., fitness ɛ≤10−06, average convergence rate for proposed scheme GA-IPA are around 100% in case of slip parameter β=0 and 1 for all different concentration of MWCNT mixed either with water or KO, while in case of EO base fluid convergence rate is around 20% on the same measures. Similarly, based on same criteria in case of β=2 convergence rate decreased slightly around 90% for water and KO and around 10% for EO cases. Additionally, on the basis of criteria, MAE≤10−05, the average convergence rate for the cases involving water and KO are around 100% for β=0 and 1 in term of velocity profilefˆ(η)and temperature distributionθˆ(η), while for EO case of β=0 and 1, the convergence rate is around 20% forfˆ(η)and reduced further forθˆ(η). Moreover, generally the best performance is observed in cases of water and KO base fluids and worst performance is observed in the cases involving EO base fluid, however, still on the criteria of MAE≤10−03, around 100% convergent rate is observed even for cases in which EO used as a base fluid.The comparative studies carry further based on two other performance operators, i.e., GMAE and mean fitness (MFit), defined as:(34)GMAE−1=1R∑r=1R1N∑η=0N−1|fref(η)−fˆr(η)|,GMAE−2=1R∑r=1R1N∑η=0N−1|θref(η)−θˆr(η)|,MFit=1R∑r=1RerHere, N is a total inputs grid points, R is the total number of independent runs,fˆr(η)θˆr(η), erare the approximate velocity profile, temperature distribution, and fitness achieved for rth independent run of the algorithm. In the simulations, inputs η ϵ [0,1] are taken with a step size of 0.1, i.e., N=11 and 100 independent runs i.e., R=100. The values of GMAE-1, GMAE-2, and MFit along with SD are calculated for all the three case studies and results are presented in Table 7. It is seen that small values of global performance operators are generally obtained for each scenario of nanofluid flow, which established the consistent accurate and convergent performance of the algorithm.The computational complexity of the given schemes is determined based on MET, i.e., average time taken for adaptation of optimal weights of ANNs by GA-IPA algorithm, MGen, average number of iteration taken by GA-IPA algorithm, and MMNFE, average number of function call during the process of optimizations. The results of complexity parameter based on 100 independent runs of proposed scheme are also listed in Table 7 along the value of SD. It is seen that on average the values of MET is around 20sec,MGen is about 1340, and MMNFE lies in close vicinity of 150,000 for solving any one case of the problem. The all the numerical experimentations are conducted on HP Note Book model 6730b, with Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo CPU P8000@2.40GHz processor, 2.00 GB RAM, and running with MATLAB version 2012a.
