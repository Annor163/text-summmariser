@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Consider a firm, called the buyer, that satisfies its demand over two periods by assigning both demands to a supplier via a second-price procurement auction; call this the Standard auction. In the hope of lowering its purchase cost, the firm is considering an alternative procedure in which it will also allow bids on each period individually, where there can be either one or two winners covering the two demands; call this the Multiple Winner auction. Choosing the Multiple Winner auction over the Standard auction can in fact result in a higher cost to the buyer. We provide a bound on how much greater the buyer’s cost can be in the Multiple Winner auction and show that this bound is tight. We then sharpen this bound for two scenarios that can arise when the buyer announces his demands close to the beginning of the demand horizon. Under a monotonicity condition, we achieve a further sharpening of the bound in one of the scenarios. Finally, this monotonicity condition allows us to generalize this bound to the T-period case in which bids are allowed on any subset of period demands.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Consider a firm, called the buyer, having demand over two periods for a product upstream in the supply chain. The buyer assigns both period demands to a supplier via a second-price procurement (reverse) auction, i.e., a Vickrey auction (Vickrey, 1961). The winner will be the supplier who submits the lowest bid, and he will be paid by the buyer not his bid but the second-lowest bid. We will refer to this as the Standard auction. Under normal conditions, the suppliers will be given sufficient advance notice by the buyer such that, in formulating their bids, the suppliers can each assume that they will have full use of their respective production capacity.In the hope of lowering its purchase cost, the buyer is considering allowing bids on each period demand individually in addition to the package of the two demands. Period demand is considered to be an indivisible item. In this auction, called the Multiple Winner auction, clearly there can be two winners covering the demands rather than just one. Here, the buyer assigns orders to his suppliers via the generalization of the Vickrey auction to heterogeneous goods, the VCG mechanism (Ausubel & Milgrom, 2006, chap. 1). Under the VCG mechanism, each supplier reports to the buyer his costs of supplying each possible subset of the buyer’s desired collection of items. The buyer then combines all information from all of the bidders to determine the optimal allocation, i.e., the one in which the buyer’s costs are minimized, which will impute who the winning bidders will be, where each winning bidder will be paid not his bid but the incremental surplus that he brings to the auction.However, as is well-known, the VCG mechanism suffers from a weakness called revenue deficiency (Ausubel & Milgrom, 2006, chap. 1; Conitzer & Sandholm, 2006; Rothkopf, 2007). Ausubel and Milgrom (2006, chap. 1) provide a simple hypothetical example, originally presented in Ausubel and Milgrom (2002), involving a forward auction of two items to three bidders. Bidder 1 only desires the package of two items and it is willing to payα>0, whereas bidders 2 and 3 are both willing to pay the same price for any of the two single items. The VCG mechanism assigns the items to bidders 2 and 3 who both pay zero. Ausubel and Milgrom point out that if the two items were instead auctioned as an indivisible set, then there would be three bidders each willing to payαfor the set. The winner would be any of them and would be payingα, yielding a higher revenue than in the VCG mechanism.The revenue deficiency phenomenon can arise in a procurement environment as well, as illustrated by the following example. A buyer needs to satisfy demand over two periods, where the demands in the two periods are identical. There are four possible suppliers, where none has significant holding costs. Suppliers 1 and 2 both have sufficient capacity in period 1 to satisfy the sum of the demands in periods 1 and 2, and both have sufficient capacity in period 2 to satisfy demand in period 2; both suppliers face a setup cost off>0in each period. Suppliers 3 and 4, due to previous commitments, each have already sunk their setup costs in both periods, but only have remaining capacity in period 1, where this capacity is sufficient to satisfy one period of demand but not both. Thus, only suppliers 1 and 2 can participate in the Standard auction; one will be chosen the winner and be paid f. All four suppliers can participate in the Multiple Winner auction, suppliers 3 and 4 will be chosen as winners, and both will be paid f. Thus, the buyer will be facing an additional payment of f in the Multiple Winner over the Standard auction.This example shows that there are cases in which the buyer will be worse off by choosing the Multiple Winner auction, i.e., the buyer needs to pay more to satisfy his demand. In this example, inventory holding costs did not come into play, nor did unit production costs. The goal of this paper is to begin a rigorous investigation of the revenue deficiency phenomenon in a procurement environment that takes account of all the relevant costs. There is scarce analytic work on revenue deficiency. In the context of a procurement auction, revenue deficiency is cost excess, and in the sequel we will primarily use the latter term.Our contribution in this paper is to provide a bound on how much worse off the buyer can be with the Multiple Winner auction, i.e., how large the cost excess can be. (Of course, the cost excess can be negative.) Specifically, we first provide an upper bound on the amount by which the cost to the buyer in the Multiple Winner auction can exceed his cost in the Standard auction. Next, we show that this bound is tight. Then we sharpen this bound for two scenarios that can arise when the buyer announces his demands close to the beginning of his demand horizon, and thus the suppliers have already made some commitments with other buyers. In the first scenario, each supplier is already committed to producing in both periods but may have some spare production capacity in one or both periods; in the second scenario, each supplier has available capacity in only one period. We achieve a further sharpening of the bound in the second scenario when a mild monotonicity condition is satisfied. Finally, this monotonicity condition allows us to generalize the bound to the T-period case in which bids are allowed on any subset of periods.The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the literature on procurement auctions. In Section 3, we formally introduce the two procurement auctions that we will be considering in the paper. In Section 4, we compare the buyer’s purchase cost resulting from running a Multiple Winner auction versus running a Standard auction, and then consider the two scenarios described above. In Section 5 we introduce the monotonicity condition and the additional results that can be achieved when the condition holds. In Section 6 we present our conclusions. All proofs appear in the Appendices.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have considered the case of a firm, called the buyer, who satisfies his demand over two periods, by either auctioning his demand profile to the least costly supplier (the “Standard auction”) via the Vickrey auction, or to the least costly set of suppliers, including the possibility of package bids (the “Multiple Winner auction”), via the VCG auction. The Multiple Winner auction can in fact result in a higher cost to the buyer than the Standard auction. We provide a bound on how much the cost to the auctioneer of the Multiple Winner auction can exceed the cost of the Standard auction. Further, we show via a class of problem instances that this bound is sharp. Some of the results of the paper will hold under more general cost functions, although the analysis becomes complex.The bound described above is the greater of two quantities. The first quantity is the maximum possible supplier setup cost. The second quantity is the maximum cost incurred by any supplier in holding the second period demand over from the first period, minus the minimum possible setup cost, where this difference is multiplied by the first period demand over the sum of the demands or by1/2, whichever is larger. This bound is based on information the buyer is likely to know to a reasonable degree. Of course, the buyer knows his own demands. Further, he is likely to understand the technology of his suppliers to the extent that he would be able to estimate their setup costs. The supplier holding costs can be estimated by the buyer’s own holding cost which, by a standard supply chain assumption, will dominate the suppliers’ holding costs.Our further results are derived for two scenarios that can arise when the buyer announces his demands close to the beginning of his demand horizon, and thus the suppliers may have already made commitments with other buyers. In the first scenario, the setup costs are supplier-independent. We find that we can improve the earlier bound. In the second scenario, each supplier has capacity available only in a single period. We find that we can improve the earlier bound in this scenario as well. If, in addition, a mild monotonicity assumption holds, we can further improve the bound, and show that this bound holds not only in the 2-period case, but in fact holds in the general T-period case. For each of these improvements, we show that the bound is sharp.One may ask what factors drive the results. We saw in the introduction an example with four suppliers, where two suppliers have essentially unlimited capacity in both periods, while the other two suppliers have capacity only in period 1. In this example, the two capacity-constrained suppliers have already sunk their setup costs in both periods—and can therefore be assumed to be zero—and their remaining capacity is only sufficient to satisfy one period demand for each of them. We found here that the revenue deficiency equals the setup cost. However, even if the setup costs do not play a role, e.g., they are sunk, revenue deficiency may still occur. In Section 4, we considered the case of two suppliers, where the first supplier has essentially unlimited capacity in the first period and no remaining capacity in the second period, while the second supplier has remaining capacity in each period that is sufficient to satisfy one period of demand. In this example, the unit production cost of the second supplier exceeds the unit production cost of the first supplier by half of the unit inventory holding cost. This scenario results in a revenue deficiency equal to half the cost of holding the second period demand over from the first period.Finally, Ausubel and Milgrom, 2006, chap. 1 point out that, since truthful reporting is a dominant strategy under the VCG mechanism, the suppliers have no incentive to spend resources learning about competitor values’ or strategies’. Our results bring in a new dimension from the point of view of the buyer. Specifically, the buyer would have a clear incentive to spend resources learning about the production capacities of his suppliers, as well as whether they engage in resource pooling. Chod et al., 2006 describe how, when making capacity, inventory, and production decisions, firms are typically uncertain about future market conditions, and that the opportunity cost associated with the quantity decisions made under uncertainty can often be mitigated by various resource pooling strategies, i.e., arrangements in which independent firms trade or subcontract capacity. Chod et al., 2006 point out that this practice is widespread in the telecommunications, pharmaceutical, and electronics manufacturing industries. The significance of this in our context is that, with resource pooling the suppliers could be considered in some circumstances to be virtually uncapacitated. Thus, a buyer sourcing via procurement auctions would have a clear incentive to spend resources learning to what extent this practice is common among his suppliers.The proofs of the results of the paper are given at the end of the appendix. In the following we establish an upper bound on the cost excess when eitherworw-is not a winner of the Multiple Winner auction. This cost excess bound is shown for a general T. Before we show this result, we require several technical results. The following lemma is a trivial observation about a scenario for which the cost excess clearly must be nonpositive.Lemma A.1In the T-period case, if the Multiple Winner auction has only one winner, thenJM⩽J.If the Multiple Winner auction has only one winner, then clearly this should be the winner of the Standard auction, i.e.,W={w1}={w}. Now the costs excess is clearly nonpositive. Indeed:JM-J=CS⧹{w}M-CS⧹{w}⩽0.□In the following we analyze the case in which the Multiple Winner auction has at least two winners. In the following we introduce some notation that will be used throughout this appendix. LetT′⊆Tbe a subset of period demands. Sincewis the winner of the Standard auction, it has enough capacity to produceT′. LetCw(T′)denote the total cost towinCwincurred when delivering the demands inT′. Notice thatCw(T′)may include costs incurred in periods outsideT′. Even further,Cw(T′)may include setup costs shared with period demands outsideT′. Similarly, we can defineCw-(T′). Finally, letTidenote the set of demands won by supplieri∈Win the Multiple Winner auction, whereCS,iMdenotes the cost to i of supplying its allocationTi.In the following, we give a useful expression of the cost excessJM-J.Lemma A.2In the T-period case, the expression ofJM-Jis equal toJM-J=∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)]-Cw-.From Eqs. (2) and (1), we have that:JM-J=CSM+∑i∈W(CS⧹{i}M-CSM)-Cw-=∑i∈WCS,iM+∑i∈W(CS⧹{i}M-CSM)-Cw-=∑i∈W[CS,iM+(CS⧹{i}M-CSM)]-Cw-=∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)]-Cw-.□The following lemma gives an upper bound on the costsCS⧹{i}M,i∈W, when eitherworw-∉W.Lemma A.3In the T-period case, the following cost relationships hold:Cw-(Ti)+(CSM-CS,iM)⩾CS⧹{i}Mi∈W,w-∉W,Cw(Ti)+(CSM-CS,iM)⩾CS⧹{i}Mi∈W,w∉W.We will establish these inequalities by finding an allocation of the period demands in the Multiple Winner auction in the absence of supplieri∈W, based on the optimal allocation of the period demands in the Multiple Winner auction.Let us first assume thati∈Wwithw-∉W. This means thati≠w-. The right hand side of the inequality corresponding to this case is by definition the lowest cost of supplying all the demands in the Multiple Winner auction when supplier i is not present. In the absence of i, all the demands allocated to him,Ti, can be assigned tow-. Sincew-∉W,Tican be produced using any production plan, as long as it does not violate the capacity constraints faced byw-. We will assume that the production timing of the period demands inTiwill be the same as the one used byw-when being responsible for all period demands. Therefore the costs incurred byw-will be by definitionCw-(Ti). Demand in the remaining periods is supplied under the optimal allocationCSM, at a cost ofCSM-CS,iM, and the desired inequality follows.The proof is similar fori∈Wwithw∉W. We just need to assign the demands inTitow.□The following lemma bounds the cost excess when eitherworw-is not a winner in the Multiple Winner auction.Lemma A.4In the T-period case, if eitherworw-is not a winner in the Multiple Winner auctionJM-J⩽(W-1)maxi∈Sfi.Supposew-∉W, i.e.Tw-=ø. By Lemma A.2, the cost excess can be written as:JM-J=∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)]-Cw-=∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)+(-Cw-(Ti)+Cw-(Ti))]-Cw-=∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)-Cw-(Ti)]+∑i∈WCw-(Ti)-Cw-,byLemmaA.3⩽0+∑i∈WCw-(Ti)-Cw-.Thus, it is enough to show that∑i∈WCw-(Ti)-Cw-is bounded by(W-1)maxi∈Sfi. Notice that{Ti}i∈Wis a partition of the time horizonT. Second, and for allt∈T, the timing of production of period demandDtin both∑i∈WCw-(Ti)andCw-is the same, by definition ofCw-(Ti). Therefore, the total variable production and holding costs in both∑i∈WCw-(Ti)andCw-are the same. With respect to the setup costs, it is clear that∑i∈WCw-(Ti)incurs at least the same number of setup costs asCw-. However, we may need to incur an extra setup cost to start production in each subsetTi, such thatD1∉Ti. Because there areW-1of these subsets,∑i∈WCw-(Ti)-Cw-⩽(W-1)fw-, and the desired bound follows.A similar bound can be derived ifw∉W. In this case, the cost excess can be bounded by(5)JM-J=∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)]-Cw-=∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)]-Cw+Cw-Cw-⩽∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)]-Cw=∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)+(-Cw(Ti)+Cw(Ti))]-Cw=∑i∈W[CS⧹{i}M-(CSM-CS,iM)-Cw(Ti)]+∑i∈WCw(Ti)-Cw.Now the proof follows in a similar fashion as above.□The bound follows when the Multiple Winner auction has exactly one winner, see Lemma A.1, or when eitherworw-is not a winner in the Multiple Winner auction, see Lemma A.4. Therefore, in the rest of the proof we will assume thatW={w,w-}, withw≠w-. In this case, the cost excess can be bounded by:JM-J=CS⧹{w}M+CS⧹{w-}M-CSM-Cw-⩽C{w-}M+C{w}M-CSM-Cw-=Cw-+Cw-CSM-Cw-=Cw-CSM,where this last term corresponds to the cost excess when the set of suppliers taking part in the bidding process is equal to{w,w-}. Therefore, in the following we will assume thatS={w,w-}.It remains to prove that(6)Cw-CSM⩽maxmaxi∈Sfi,maxD1D1+D2,12(maxi∈Shi)D2-mini∈Sfi.We will prove (6) by distinguishing cases defined by the capacity faced bywandw-and the production timing of both demands inCwandCw-. In particular, we will distinguish the following three possibilities for each of the two suppliers, leaving in total nine cases to be analyzed: (i) capacity is only available in period 1 and therefore both demands are produced in period 1, (ii) capacity in period 1 is not enough to produce both demands and therefore each demand is produced in its own period, and (iii) there is enough capacity in each period and both demands are produced in period 1. We may observe that there is one remaining possibility, i.e., there is enough capacity in each period and each demand is produced in its own period. In this case, if this supplier is allocated demandD2, this demand will be produced in period 2 as this is feasible and at least as cheap as producing it in period 1. This means that the capacity in period 1 will never be used to produceD2. Thus, it will be enough to consider possibility (ii).Before we analyze each case, we derive a lower bound on the difference in unit production costs,pw-pw-, based on the inequalityCw-⩾Cw. This lower bound will be used when bounding the cost excess. We have that:(7)Cw-⩾Cwfw-+pw-(D1+D2)+Πw-⩾fw+pw(D1+D2)+Πwfw--fw+Πw--Πw⩾(pw-pw-)(D1+D2)1D1+D2[fw--fw+Πw--Πw]⩾pw-pw-whereΠs∈{fs,hsD2}ands=w,w-.1.Bothwandw-each have capacity only in period 1.This means that inCw,Cw-andCSM,D2will be produced in period 1, and all three solutions incur inventory holding costs when deliveringD2. Moreover, inCSM,D1will be allocated to the supplier with the cheapest unit production costs, i.e.,argmin{pw,pw-}, whileD2will be allocated to the supplier with the cheapest unit production costs plus unit inventory holding costs, i.e.,argmin{pw+hw,pw-+hw-}. Since the Multiple Winner auction has two winners, these two suppliers should be different, i.e.,argmin{pw,pw-}≠argmin{pw+hw,pw-+hw-}.This means that either(8)pw⩽pw-⩽pw-+hw-⩽pw+hwor(9)pw-⩽pw⩽pw+hw⩽pw-+hw-,where in both cases at least one inequality should be strict. We will analyze these two cases separately.(a)Suppose that (8) holds, where at least one of these inequalities is strict. This means that inCSM,D1is assigned towandD2is assigned tow-.The cost excess now can be bounded using (7) whereΠs=hsD2:Cw-CSM=(pwD2+hwD2)-(fw-+pw-D2+hw-D2)=(pw-pw-)D2+hwD2-hw-D2-fw-⩽D2D1+D2[fw--fw+hw-D2-hwD2]+hwD2-hw-D2-fw-=(1-D2D1+D2)[(hw-hw-)D2-fw-]-D2D1+D2fw⩽D1D1+D2[hwD2-fw-].Suppose that (9) holds, where at least one of these inequalities is strict. This means that inCSM,D1is assigned tow-andD2is assigned tow.The cost excess now can be again bounded using (7):Cw-CSM=pwD1-(fw-+pw-D1)=(pw-pw-)D1-fw-⩽D1D1+D2[fw--fw-(hw-hw-)D2]-fw-=D1D1+D2[(hw--hw)D2-fw]+(D1D1+D2-1)fw-⩽D1D1+D2[hw-D2-fw].Thus, in both cases (6) follows.Bothwandw-have capacity in both periods but the capacity in period 1 is not enough to produce both demands.This means that inCw,Cw-andCSM,D2will be produced in period 2 and therefore no inventory holding costs are incurred. In order to prove the result, we will distinguish two cases for the unit production costs.Suppose thatpw⩽pw-. Because inCwboth demands are allocated towwhile inCSMone will be allocated instead tow-, in terms of total production costsCwis as cheap asCSM. Thus, when bounding the cost excessCw-CSMwe focus on the setup costs, andCw-CSM⩽2fw-(fw+fw-)=fw-fw-.Ifpw>pw-, by noting that the cost excess is bounded byCw--CSM, we have thatCw-CSM⩽Cw--CSM⩽2fw--(fw+fw-)=fw--fw.Thus, in both cases the cost excess is bounded bymaxi∈Sfiand (6) follows.Bothwandw-have enough capacity in both periods and produce both demands in period 1.This means that inCSM,D2will be produced in period 2. Thus,CSMis as in Case 2. With respect toCwandCw-, both suppliers produce both demands in period 1, but there is an alternative solution, at least as expensive, in which each demand is produced in its own period as in Case 2. Now it is easy to see that the cost excess bound derived in Case 2 applies here too.Supplierwhas only capacity in period 1, whilew-has capacity in both periods but the capacity in period 1 is not enough to produce both demands.We will distinguish two cases depending on the supplier in charge of demandD2inCSM.(a)IfD2is allocated towinCSM,D2will be produced in period 1 sincewhas only capacity in period 1. This means that bothCwandCSMincur inventory holding costs.The cost excess can be bounded using (7) whereΠw=hwD2andΠw-=fw-:Cw-CSM=pwD1-(fw-+pw-D1)=(pw-pw-)D1-fw-⩽D1D1+D2[2fw--fw-hwD2]-fw-⩽2D1D1+D2fw--fw-=D1-D2D1+D2fw-⩽fw-,and (6) follows.IfD2is assigned tow-inCSM,D2will be produced in period 2, and neitherCw-orCSMincur inventory holding costs. Ifpw⩾pw-, as in Case 2, the cost excess is bounded byCw-CSM⩽fw--fwand inequality (6) follows.Now, suppose thatpw->pw.i.IfD2>D1, from inequalityCw-⩾Cwwe have that(10)Cw-⩾Cw2fw-+pw-(D1+D2)⩾fw+pw(D1+D2)+hwD22(fw--fw)+(pw--pw)(D1+D2)⩾-fw+hwD22(fw--fw)+2(pw--pw)D2⩾-fw+hwD2SinceD2>D1:(fw--fw)+(pw--pw)D2⩾12(-fw+hwD2)(fw--fw)+12(fw-hwD2)⩾(pw-pw-)D2.The cost excess now can be bounded using (10)Cw-CSM=(pwD2+hwD2)-(fw-+pw-D2)=(pw-pw-)D2+hwD2-fw-⩽(fw--fw)+12(fw-hwD2)+hwD2-fw-=12(hwD2-fw),and (6) follows.Otherwise,D2⩽D1. Using (7):(11)Cw-CSM=(pw-pw-)D2+hwD2-fw-⩽1D1+D2{2fw--fw-hwD2}D2+hwD2-fw-=(1-D2D1+D2)hwD2-D2D1+D2{fw-2fw-}-fw-=D1D1+D2hwD2-1D1+D2{D2fw+(D1-D2)fw-}=D1D1+D2hwD2-D2D1fw+1-D2D1fw-=D1D1+D2hwD2-fw-+D2D1(fw-fw-)(12)=D1D1+D2hwD2-fw+1-D2D1(fw--fw).Iffw-⩽fw, thenD2D1(fw-fw-)⩾0. Using inequality (11), the cost excess is bounded byD1D1+D2hwD2-fw-and (6) follows. Alternatively, iffw->fw, sinceD2⩽D1,(1-D2D1)(fw--fw)⩾0. Using inequality (12), (6) follows.Supplierwhas only capacity in period 1, whilew-has enough capacity in both periods and produces both demands in period 1.The cost excess bound (6) will be derived using the analysis in Case 4. First, observe that once the demands are allocated to both suppliers, the value ofCSMwill be the same as in Case 4, sincew-has got enough capacity in period 2 to produceD2. Second, notice that in the proof of Case 4,Cw-is always used as an upper bound ofCw. Therefore, (6) follows here too by noticing thatCw-can be bounded from above by2fw-+pw-(D1+D2), the value ofCw-in Case 4.Supplierwhas capacity in both periods but the capacity in period 1 is not enough to produce both demands, whilew-has only capacity in period 1.It is easy to see that this case is the mirror one to Case 4. We will again distinguish two cases depending on the supplier in charge of demandD2inCSM. For ease of presentation, we will exchange the order of the assignments, analyzing first the case in whichD2is allocated tow-inCSM.(a)IfD2is allocated tow-inCSM,D2will be produced in period 1. The cost excess can be bounded using (7) whereΠw=fwandΠw-=hw-D2. Thus,Cw-CSM=(pw-pw-)D2+fw-fw--hw-D2⩽D2D1+D2(fw--2fw+hw-D2)+fw-fw--hw-D2=1-2D2D1+D2fw+D2D1+D2-1(fw-+hw-D2)⩽D1-D2D1+D2fw⩽fwand (6) follows.IfD2is assigned towinCSM,D2will be produced in period 2.Ifpw-⩾pw, the cost excess is bounded byCw-CSM⩽fw-fw-.Now, suppose thatpw>pw-.i.IfD2>D1, we have that(13)Cw-⩾Cwfw-+pw-(D1+D2)+hw-D2⩾2fw+pw(D1+D2)fw-+hw-D2⩾2fw+(pw-pw-)(D1+D2)SinceD2>D1:fw-+hw-D2⩾2(fw+(pw-pw-)D1)-fw+12(fw-+hw-D2)⩾(pw-pw-)D1.The cost excess now can be bounded using (13)Cw-CSM=(fw+pwD1)-(fw-+pw-D1)=(fw-fw-)+(pw-pw-)D1⩽(fw-fw-)-fw+12(fw-+hw-D2)=-fw-+12(fw-+hw-D2)=12(hw-D2-fw-),and (6) follows.Otherwise,D2⩽D1.Inequality (7) will be used to bound the cost excess(14)Cw-CSM=(pw-pw-)D1+(fw-fw-)⩽D1D1+D2(fw--2fw+hw-D2)+(fw-fw-)=D1D1+D2hw-D2+fw--2fw+D1+D2D1(fw-fw-)=D1D1+D2hw-D2+fw--2fw+1+D2D1(fw-fw-)=D1D1+D2hw-D2-fw+D2D1(fw-fw-)(15)=D1D1+D2hw-D2-fw-+D2D1-1(fw-fw-).Iffw⩽fw-, thenD2D1(fw-fw-)⩽0. Using inequality (14), (6) follows. Alternatively, iffw-<fw, using thatD2⩽D1,(D2D1-1)(fw-fw-)⩽0. Using inequality (15), (6) follows.Supplierwhas capacity in both periods but the capacity in period 1 is not enough to produce both demands, whilew-has enough capacity in both periods and produces both demands in period 1.InCwandCSM,D2will be produced in period 2 and therefore no inventory holding costs are incurred as in Case 2. With respect toCw-, there is an alternative solution, at least as expensive, in which each demand is produced in its own period as in Case 2. Now it is easy to see that the cost excess bound derived in Case 2 applies here too.Supplierwhas enough capacity in both periods and produces both demands in period 1, whilew-has only capacity in period 1.The proof of this case flows as in Case 6.Supplierwhas enough capacity in both periods and produces both demands in period 1, whilew-has capacity in both periods but the capacity in period 1 is not enough to produce both demands.The argument here is similar as in Case 7.□Consider the following class of problem instances, where the buyer requires demands(D,D). The number of suppliers is equal to four, i.e.S=4, where each supplier faces a unit production cost p and a unit holding cost h. The supplier setup costs and the capacities are given by:(16)fi=0fori=1,2ffori=3,4bit=Dfori=1,2,t=i2Dfori=3,4,t=10otherwise,where parametersf,p, and h are all positive.Let us first look at the case of the Standard auction. Suppliers 3 and 4 have identical cost and capacity structures, and are the only suppliers who have sufficient capacity to individually produce the demands. Therefore, in the Standard auction the winner is either supplier 3 or 4. Without loss of generality, we assume that it is supplier 3 with:CS=C3=f+p(D+D)+hD=f+2pD+hD[w=3].In the Multiple Winner auction, it is easy to see that the optimal allocation consists of assigningDtto supplier t in period t, fort=1,2. The cost of this allocation is:CSM=(0+pD)+(0+pD)=2pD[w1=1,w2=2].In the Standard auction, in the absence of supplier 3, supplier 4 delivers the demands with the same costs, i.e.,J=CS⧹{3}=C4=f+2pD+hD. The cost excess is equal toJM-J=CS⧹{1}M+CS⧹{2}M-CSM-CS⧹{3}=CS⧹{1}M+CS⧹{2}M-CSM-C4=CSM+(CS⧹{1}M-CSM)+(CS⧹{2}M-CSM)-C4in the absence of supplier 1, the best option is to reassignD1to supplier 3 at an extra cost of f=CSM+f+(CS⧹{2}M-CSM)-C4in the absence of supplier 2, we must reassignD2to supplier 3 at an extra cost off+hD=CSM+f+f+hD-C4=(2pD)+(2f+hD)-(f+2pD+hD)=f,and the desired result follows.□Consider the following class of problem instances, where the buyer requires demands(D1,D2), whereD1⩾D2, and thusmaxD1D1+D2,12=D1D1+D2ifD1>D212ifD1=D2.The number of suppliers is equal to two, i.e.,S=2. Both suppliers face setup costs equal to zero and unit holding costs equal to h. The supplier unit production costs and capacities are given by:pi=pfori=1p+hD2D1+D2fori=2bit=D1+D2fori=1,t=1Dtfori=2,t=1,20otherwise,where parameters p and h are both positive.Let us first look at the Standard auction. Because of the capacity structure supplier 1 has to produce both demands in period 1, incurring a total cost equal toC1=0+(p1)D1+(p1+h1)D2=p(D1+D2)+hD2,while supplier 2 must produce each demand in its own period, incurring a total cost equal toC2=(0+p2D1)+(0+p2D2)=(p+hD2D1+D2)(D1+D2).It is easy to see thatC1=C2and, without loss of generality, we assume that the winner of this auction is supplier 1, i.e.:CS=C1[w=1].In the Multiple Winner auction, and because the setup costs are equal to zero, each demand will be allocated to the supplier with the lowest total unit cost. Therefore:CSM=minp,p+hD2D1+D2D1+minp+h,p+hD2D1+D2D2=pD1+(p+hD2D1+D2)D2=p(D1+D2)+hD2D1+D2D2.Since there are only two suppliers and the winner of the Standard auction is supplier 1, the cost excess is given byC1-CSM:JM-J=C1-CSM=(p(D1+D2)+hD2)-p(D1+D2)+hD2D1+D2D2=h1-D2D1+D2D2=hD1D1+D2D2.Now the desired result follows whenh=H.□We need to show that if the setup costs are supplier-independent the new bound for the cost excess is equal to(17)maxf,D1D1+D2HD2-f.As in the proof of Theorem 4.1, it remains to show that the bound is valid whenW={w,w-}. The analysis of this case was approached in the proof of Theorem 4.1 by distinguishing nine cases depending on the capacity faced bywandw-and the timing of the production of both demands inCwandCw-. In the following, we focus on the cases in which the bound obtained in the proof of Theorem 4.1 was equal to12HD2-f>D1D1+D2HD2-f, i.e., Case 4(b), Case 6(b) and Case 8(b).We will analyze one of these cases and the rest can be handled in a similar way. Consider Case 4(b) withpw-⩽pw, then (17) follows. Now consider Case 4(b) withpw->pw. There, we distinguished two subcases depending on whetherD2>D1. If the setup costs are supplier-independent, the bound derived for subcaseD2⩽D1is valid for theD2>D1subcase too. Indeed, we know thatCw-CSM=(pw-pw-)D2+hwD2-fw-⩽D2D1+D2{2fw--fw-hwD2}+hwD2-fw-=D2D1+D2{f-hwD2}D2+hwD2-f=D1D1+D2{hwD2-f}⩽D1D1+D2{HD2-f},and (17) follows.Finally, the tightness of the bound (17) is a straightforward corollary from Propositions 4.5 and 4.6. We simply need to notice that, in the class of problem instances used in both propositions, the setup costs are stationary.□This proposition can be proved in a similar fashion to Proposition 4.8. We need to show that if capacity is only available in one period the new bound for the cost excess is equal to(18)maxmaxi∈Sfi,D1D1+D2HD2-mini∈Sfi.Again, it remains to show that the bound is valid whenW={w,w-}. Since capacity is only available in one period,wandw-will enjoy their capacity in period 1. This corresponds to Case 1 in the proof of Theorem 4.1. From that analysis, the result follows trivially.To derive the tightness of the bound (18), we will use the class of problem instances introduced in Proposition 4.6, but where supplier 2 has the same capacity pattern as supplier 1. This means that this class of problem instances satisfies the capacity in only one period condition. Additionally, we impose that the unit inventory holding cost of supplier 2 is equal to zero.Let us first look at the Standard auction. Now both suppliers have to produce both demands in period 1, incurring a total cost equal toC1=0+(p1)D1+(p1+h1)D2=p(D1+D2)+hD2C2=0+(p2)D1+(p2+h2)D2=p+hD2D1+D2(D1+D2)=p(D1+D2)+hD2.Again,C1=C2and, without loss of generality, the winner of this auction is supplier 1.In the Multiple Winner auction, and because the setup costs are equal to zero, each demand will be allocated to the supplier with the lowest total unit cost. Therefore:CSM=minp,p+hD2D1+D2D1+minp+h,p+hD2D1+D2D2=pD1+p+hD2D1+D2D2.The rest of the proof flows as in Proposition 4.8, and the desired result follows.□From Lemma A.4, it remains to show that ifwandw-are both winners of the Multiple Winner auction, there is an alternative allocation where both period demands are assigned to the same supplier. Suppose thatwandw-∈W. Lets∈argmin{pw,pw-}. In the remaining of the proof, we will show that there exists an alternative allocation in the Multiple Winner auction such that the period demands inTs′are assigned to supplier s, wheres′∈{w,w-}⧹{s}. Thus, in this alternative allocation eitherworw-∉W, and the desired result follows.Using the monotonicity condition, we have thats∈argmin{pw+(t-1)hw,pw-+(t-1)hw-}, for allt=2,…,T. This means that, in terms of total unit costs associated with each period demand, supplier s is at least as attractive ass′. Together with the fact that capacity is only available in period 1 for both s ands′, this means thatCs′(Ts′)-fs′⩾Cs(Ts′)-fs. Now we haveCSM=∑i∈WCS,iM=∑i∈W,i≠s,s′CS,iM+CS,sM+CS,s′MSincecapacityisonlyavailableinperiod1:=∑i∈W,i≠s,s′CS,iM+Cs(Ts)+Cs′(Ts′)=∑i∈W,i≠s,s′CS,iM+fs+(Cs(Ts)-fs)+fs′+(Cs′(Ts′)-fs′)⩾∑i∈W,i≠s,s′CS,iM+fs+(Cs(Ts)-fs)+fs′+(Cs(Ts′)-fs)⩾∑i∈W,i≠s,s′CS,iM+Cs(Ts)+Cs(Ts′)-fs=∑i∈W,i≠s,s′CS,iM+Cs(Ts∪Ts′),and thusCSM=∑i∈W,i≠s,s′CS,iM+Cs(Ts∪Ts′), and thus we have found an alternative allocation in whichs′is not a winner of the Multiple Winner auction.□Consider the following class of problem instances, where the buyer requires demand vectorD∈RT, such thatD1>D2>…>DT-1>DT>1. The number of suppliers exceeds the number of periods by two, i.e.,S=T+2, where each supplier faces a setup cost f and a unit holding cost h in each period. The supplier unit production costs and capacities are given by:(19)pi=p+(T-i)ffori⩽Tp+Tffori=T+1,T+2bit=Dtfori⩽T,t=i∑τ=1TDτfori=T+1,T+2,t=10otherwise,where parametersf,p, and h are all positive.Now we will determine the structure of the optimal allocation in the Standard auction and in the Multiple Winner auction. First have a look at the case of the Standard auction. SuppliersT+1andT+2have identical cost and capacity structures, and are the only suppliers who have sufficient capacity to individually produce the demand vector. Therefore, in the Standard auction the winner is either supplierT+1orT+2. Without loss of generality, we assume that it is supplierT+1with:(20)CS=f+∑t=1T[p+Tf+(t-1)h]Dt[w=T+1].In the Multiple Winner auction, it can be shown by contradiction that the optimal allocation consists of assigningDtto supplier t in period t, for eacht∈T(see the Appendices) with(21)CSM=∑t=1Tf+[p+(T-t)f]Dt,=Tf+∑t=1T[p+(T-t)f]Dt,andW=T={1,…,T}.Now we will determine the structure of the optimal allocation in the Multiple Winner auction after the elimination of suppliert∈W. It can be shown by contradiction that each demandDτ, withτ≠t, will be assigned to supplierτin periodτ, while the demandDtwill be allocated without loss of generality to supplierT+1in period 1 (see the Appendices). This means that in determiningCS⧹{t}Mall demands, except forDt, are allocated in the same manner as in determiningCSM. Therefore,(22)CS⧹{t}M-CSM=f+[p+Tf]Dt+(t-1)hDt-f+[p+(T-t)f]Dt=[tf+(t-1)h]Dtforeacht∈W.In the Standard auction, in the absence of supplierT+1, supplierT+2delivers the demands with the same costs, i.e.,J=CS⧹{T+1}=CT+2=f+∑t=1T[p+Tf+(t-1)h]Dt. The cost excess is equal toJM-J=CSM+∑i∈W(CS⧹{i}M-CSM)-CS⧹{T+1}=CSM+∑i∈W(CS⧹{i}M-CSM)-CT+2=CSM+∑t=1T(CS⧹{t}M-CSM)-CT+2,andfrom(21)and(22):=(Tf+∑t=1T[p+(T-t)f]Dt)+∑t=1T[tf+(t-1)h]Dt-CT+2=Tf+∑t=1T[p+Tf+(t-1)h]Dt-CT+2=(T-1)f=(min{S,T}-1)f,and the desired result follows.□Here we will discuss in detail the structure of the optimal allocation in the Multiple Winner auction and in the Multiple Winner auction after the elimination of suppliert∈W.Before we analyze these allocations, recall that suppliersT+1andT+2have identical cost and capacity structures. When required, without loss of generality we will choose supplierT+1. Also notice that, for this class of problem instances, the setup and the unit inventory holding costs are the same for all suppliers; therefore when comparing two (supplier, period) combinations we only need to discuss the unit production costs. We have that: (a) the only supplier that can produce demandDtin period t is supplier t, for allt∈{2,…,T}, and (b) supplier 1 is the one having the cheapest unit production costs in period 1. From observations (a) and (b), we can derive that (c) supplier t is the cheapest option when producingDtin period t, for allt∈{1,…,T}.We will start withCSM. In this paragraph, we will show that in the optimal allocation for the Multiple Winner auction, every demand will be produced in the period in which it is demanded. From this and observation (c) the desired result follows, i.e., the optimal allocation in the Multiple Winner auction consists of assigningDtto supplier t in period t, for eacht∈{1,…,T}. Now suppose that, in the optimal allocation of the Multiple Winner auction, there exists at least one demand that is produced in advance. Lettˆbe the largest element in{1,…,T}such thatDtˆis produced in advance. This means that any demandDt, witht>tˆ, will be produced in the period in which it is demanded. SinceDtˆis produced in advance and the demands in the future are produced in the respective periods in which they are demanded, we know that suppliertˆdoes not produce in periodtˆ. In the following, we will show that by allocating demandDtˆto suppliertˆin periodtˆ, we obtain a feasible allocation which is cheaper than the current one, and this will yield a contradiction. First, it is easy to see that this is a feasible allocation, since suppliertˆdoes not produce during periodtˆ. Second, we will show that this yields a cheaper allocation. Because demandDtˆis produced some time before periodtˆ, the unit production cost paid for this demand will be at leastp+(T-(tˆ-1))f. Therefore the variable production costs incurred will be at least[p+(T-(tˆ-1))f]Dtˆ. SinceDtˆ>1, we have that this cost is greater thanf+[p+(T-tˆ)f]Dtˆ, i.e., the total cost of producingDtˆby suppliertˆin periodtˆ(including setup costs), a contradiction.We will now discussCS⧹{t}M,t∈{1,…,T}. Since suppliersT+1andT+2are identical, we will discard supplierT+2from the rest of the proof. Using a similar argument as forCSM, we have that demandDτwill be produced in time by supplierτ, for allτ>t. In the following, we will show that demandDtwill be produced in period 1 by supplierT+1. Using a similar argument as forτ>t, this will imply that, for allτ<t, demandDτwill also be produced in time by supplierτ, and the desired result will follow. Now consider the allocation of demandDt. Suppose thatDtis not assigned to supplierT+1, then it will be produced by suppliert̃in periodt̃witht̃∈{1,…,t-1}, while, and using a similar argument as in the case ofCSM, the demands indexed by{t̃+1,…,t-1}will be produced in the period in which they are demanded. Because of capacity constraints of suppliert̃, demandDt̃will need to be produced in advance. Eventually, there will be a single demand in the future that will need to be produced in period 1, by supplier 1 because of observation (b). Again, due to capacity constraints,D1will need to be assigned to supplierT+1. However, the unit production cost of supplier 1 is cheaper than that of supplierT+1. Therefore, by exchanging the assignments of suppliers 1 andT+1, we obtain a feasible allocation that is cheaper than the current one, a contradiction.□
