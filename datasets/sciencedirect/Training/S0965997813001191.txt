@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents an efficient and stable as-rigid-as-possible mesh deformation algorithm for planar shape deformation and hexahedral mesh generation. The deformation algorithm aims to preserve two local geometric properties: scale-invariant intrinsic variables and elastic deformation energy, which are together represented in a quadric energy function. To preserve these properties, the position of each vertex is further adjusted by iteratively minimizing this quadric energy function to meet the position constraint of the controlling points. Experimental results show that the deformation algorithm is efficient, and can obtain physically plausible results, which have the same topology structure with the original mesh. Such a mesh deformation method is useful to project the source surface mesh onto the target surfaces in hexahedral mesh generation based on sweep method, and application results show that the proposed method is feasible to mesh projection not only between similar surface contours but also dissimilar surface contours.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Mesh has gradually become the mainstream representation of geometric models, and deformation technique for planar mesh model has received a lot of attentions in recent years. Planar mesh deformation is widely used in many application fields, such as computer aided design, mesh generation, shape modeling, computer animation and other applications. A good mesh deformation algorithm aims to produce naturally deforming results, which are homeomorphic to the original planar mesh, and the final positions of the controlling points should be precise. Furthermore, in the field of solid mesh generation, hexahedral mesh generation has always been concerned, since hexahedral mesh offers several numerical advantages over tetrahedral mesh due to its tensor product nature. Surveys show that more than 60% volumes are meshed by sweep method, which shows that sweep method has been the workhorse algorithm in hexahedral mesh applications [1]. Given a swept volume, it is necessary to project the source surface mesh onto the target surfaces, and therefore the most challenging issue to be dealt with by any sweep method is the interpolation between the source mesh contours and the target surface contours.In this paper, we focus on planar mesh deformation, a critical step towards generation of hexahedral mesh based on sweep method, and propose a new as-rigid-as-possible planar mesh deformation algorithm. The deformation algorithm aims to preserve two local properties: scale-invariant intrinsic variables and elastic deformation energy, which are together represented in a quadric energy function. We iteratively minimize the linear quadric energy function to adjust the position of each vertex to obtain a physically plausible deforming result, which can meet the position constraints of the controlling points. We also introduce a scheme to project the source surface mesh onto the target surfaces in sweep based hexahedral mesh generation via the proposed deformation algorithm, and numerical experiments show that a homeomorphous deformed mesh can be obtained and used to achieve the projection between surfaces with dissimilar contours.
