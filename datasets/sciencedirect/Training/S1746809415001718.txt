@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We propose a system for automatic Berg Balance Scale assessment (ABBSAS).The system employs inertial sensors distributed over a patient's body.A specified feature vector is determined for each of fourteen BBS items.Sixty-four elderly patients’ BBS examinations constitute the reference database.The ABBSAS is evaluated in details using introduced assessment metrics.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents the automatic system for computer-aided balance assessment reflecting the Berg Balance Scale. The system employs inertial sensors for the data acquisition purposes. A set of features is extracted from multiple signal representations during the examination. A multilevel Fisher's linear discriminant is used to select most suitable features for each of the BBS tasks. The feature space dimensionality reduction and the multilayer perceptron classifier training both involve expert scoring on the observed examinations. The system is verified using data acquired during the BBS scoring of 64 elderly patients. Both assessment modes: the entire examination as well as separate BBS items, are evaluated and discussed using introduced assessment metrics.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Clinical decision making in case of balance assessment is a challenging problem. Numerous factors might induce balance disorders or increase susceptibility to falls. Balance problems are often associated with diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, neurological and musculoskeletal diseases [1,2]). The importance of this issue is enhanced by aging of contemporary societies. Thus, the clinical balance assessment has been deeply studied in the past decades [3]. The balance and gait analysis in terms of searching for certain measures or patterns, their diversity related to various impairments and disorders is often very profitable for clinical assessment and diagnosis purposes [4,5]. The gait speed or motion dimensions in triaxial coordinate system [6], time-frequency representations of acceleration or angular velocity data [4], acceleration derivatives [7] provide substantial numerical information for the assessment of various motion or postural issues.All these issues are supported by the ambient assisted living (AAL) systems designed for the elderly telecare [8]. Such systems employ multiple data types, acquisition equipment and procedures for direct monitoring or computer-aided diagnosis and therapy planning [9] including video/audio maintenance, emergency call procedures, movement detectors, radiowave or ultrasound beacons, wearable devices with various sensors, etc. [8,10]. Apart from the immediate intervention applications, the AAL might offer more comprehensive functionalities in terms of long-term health state trends monitoring or a patient-specific model definition [11]. Such a perspective is clearly broader than a single, precise analysis and might be constructed by gathering available knowledge for the decision making process.There are several functional examinations dedicated to the balance assessment [12]. The general idea is to select certain activities (changing positions, gait, standing or sitting, etc.) able to reflect balance abilities of the subject. The examinations differ in simplicity, time and equipment requirements, specific subject of assessment interest. The Tinetti Balance and Gait Examination [13] combines 24 balance and gait tasks for reliable fall prediction. The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) [14] evaluates different daily activities using a 16-item questionnaire. The Physiological Profile Approach (PPA) [15] involves a multiple tests, verifying vision, cutaneous sensation on the feet, leg muscle force, reaction time, and postural sway in stance. The Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) [16] consists of 36 items organized into 6 thematic issues, aggregating information from multiple sources, including examinations mentioned here, yet it takes ca. 30 min. Fast results are yielded by quick tests (e.g. “timed up and go” – TUG [17], functional reach [18]), yet yield the assessment might not be treated as comprehensive as in previously mentioned cases.In our study the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) [19,20] has been found a reasonable examination, balancing the time, resources, and reliability factors. It consists of 14 different tasks, each rated in a 5-level scale (0 – 4): (1) sitting to standing, (2) standing unsupported, (3) sitting unsupported, (4) standing to sitting, (5) transfers, (6) standing with eyes closed, (7) standing with feet together, (8) reaching forward with outstretched arm, (9) retrieving an object from the floor, (10) turning to look behind, (11) turning 360°, (12) placing alternate foot on stool, (13) standing with one foot in front, (14) standing on one foot. The precise assessment specification and guidelines might be found in [19]. Based on the total score, the subject is assigned to one of three balance groups: wheelchair bound (0 – 20), walking with assistance (21 – 40), independent (40 – 56). The BBS is commonly used for balance assessment mainly due to its simplicity, universality, high (over 95 %) indicators of inter-rater reliability and specificity [12]. On the other hand, its fall prediction sensitivity has been questioned recently [21]. Also the possible uncertainty between two close scores remains an issue to be considered (an 8-point change is required to discover a significant condition change) [22]. An automated, more objective data analysis may improve the fall prediction sensitivity.Our goal in this study is to design and evaluate an automatic balance assessment using BBS specification. To the best of our knowledge, there are no research reports on this issue. The computer-aided diagnosis assessment tool employs the AAL architecture based on triaxial inertial sensors [11,23]. Such a tool might be useful in remote telecare of the elderly in home environment, providing consistent numerical groundwork for balance monitoring. Preliminary research on this matter have been performed using 7 selected BBS activities and a group of 52 elderly patients [24] with the investigation on sensor location influence on assessment efficiency [25]. In this paper we propose the Automatic Berg Balance Scale Assessment System (ABBSAS) and involve the entire BBS examinations of 64 elderly patients into the training and testing procedures. The system uses a set of features extracted from signals. The evaluation and discussion employ several assessment reliability metrics.The paper is organized as follows. The materials and ABBSAS is presented in Section 2 with all structure and methodology details. The experimental results are described in Section 3 and discussed in Section 4. The paper is concluded in Section 5.
