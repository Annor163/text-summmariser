@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Merging sustainable development with the business, and taking goals into account from its three dimensions (i.e., economic, environmental and social) which are derived from customer and stakeholder requirements have been a potential source of competitive differentiation for firms. Academic and corporate interest in sustainable supply chain (SSC) management has also risen considerably in recent years. This paper examines the components and elements of SSC management and how they serve as a foundation for an evaluation framework. By using quality function deployment (QFD) as a product/system planning and improvement tool, an effective SSC structure can be obtained. QFD uses a matrix called the “House of Quality” (HoQ), and constructing the HoQ is a critical step in the application of QFD as it translates customer requirements into engineering characteristics. However, participants of HoQ construction sessions tend to provide information about their individual judgments in multiple formats such as numerically or linguistically depending on their different knowledge, experience, culture and circumstance. Furthermore, they can generate incomplete preferences which are challenging to assess in a consistent way. Therefore, the objective of this study is to apply an extended QFD methodology in SSC by introducing a new group decision making (GDM) approach that takes multiple preference formats and incomplete information into account and fusions different formats of expressions into one uniform group decision by means of the fuzzy set theory. To assess the validity of the proposed approach, a case study conducted at HAVI Logistics-Turkey is also presented in the paper.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Quality function deployment (QFD) is a technique to translate customer needs into practical measures. This approach enables the firms to become proactive to quality problems rather than taking a reactive position by acting on customer complaints. QFD is comprised of major group decision making (GDM) processes. In practice, determining the weights of customer requirements (CRs) is a GDM process. This is mainly because of the risk of relying on a single decision maker's (DM) limitations of experiences, preferences or biases about the issues involved. Multiple DMs, thus GDM, are often preferred rather than a single DM to avoid bias and minimize the partiality in the decision process [7,10,22].However, it is more difficult to assess the performance of this process with accurate quantitative evaluation due to its uncertain nature. In a GDM process, DMs generally give their own judgments in many different ways, numerically or linguistically, depending on their background. Several authors proposed GDM in QFD, which takes multi-format preferences into account [7,8,75]. Yet, there can be situations of a DM not having perfect and complete knowledge about the problem to be solved, or a DM not being able to efficiently express any kind of preference degree between two or more of the available options. Moreover, due to constraints as time pressure, lack of motivation, etc., DMs may develop preferences in which some of the elements cannot be provided. By involving the use of incomplete preference relations in GDM, such constraints for evaluations can be handled effectively and the evaluation would be stronger and healthier. Eventually, the GDM process in QFD needs to derive a single group preference from a number of incomplete or specific individual preference styles. Although QFD studies which address multiple formatted preferences exist, none of those handles incomplete information besides.As QFD is a customer-driven tool, it is important to consider that in the current business environment, customer demands are diversified and supply chain management (SCM) now coming under increased scrutiny from customers and governments regarding their compliance with environmental and social responsibility [55]. To obtain more sustainable solutions, organization properties must meet both customer and sustainable SC requirements. Thus, this paper also proposes a sustainable QFD structure to clearly understand the CRs and determine characteristics to meet these expectations for a sustainable SCM.Under such circumstances, an analytical tool is offered for perceiving and prioritizing the quantitative and qualitative, sometimes vague and imprecise or even incomplete preference of the customer in QFD. The objective of this study is to apply an extended QFD methodology to sustainable SC by introducing a GDM approach that takes multiple preference formats [7,8,22,68,75] and incomplete information [3,24,25,67,69,70] into account, and fuses different expressions into one uniform group decision by means of fuzzy set theory [62]. In addition, to assess the validity of the proposed approach and QFD structure, an application at a supply chain company, HAVI Logistics-Turkey, is presented in the paper. As the study of multiple and incomplete preferences is not widespread in the literature, there exists no references that combines both of these topics with QFD or any other methods, nor any other that applies those in sustainable SCM field.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 firstly provides brief information and presents the essence of the integrated approach, then explains the computational procedure step by step. Then Section 3 gives a literature survey about application area (sustainable SCM) and proposed QFD model. Application in HAVI Logistics Turkey is then given in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the study and gives future directions.Much has been published about QFD since the concept was initiated in the mid-1960s [4,5,20,33,40]. It is mainly a tool to help organizations seek out both spoken and unspoken needs, translate these into actions and designs, and focus various business functions toward achieving this common goal, empowering organizations to exceed normal expectations and provide a level of unanticipated excitement that generates value. One of the products and also heart of QFD is a “House of Quality” (HOQ) matrix, which enables a quick visual comparison of “what customers want” versus “how suppliers can give it to them”. The basic format of the HOQ consists of six different major parts which are explained in Fig. 1. Detailed description of the HOQ steps applied in this study is given in Section 2.2.As a typical HOQ process, DMs always give preference information on decision matrices to construct the HOQ. However, the DMs’ judgments vary in form and depth. Since the DMs may have diverse cultural and educational background and value systems, their preference would be expressed in many different ways. Determining consensus group decisions is not an easy task under such complex circumstances. Thus, previous papers proposed studies in which the DMs are asked to express their preferences on a variety of criteria using different preference formats [71,75]. Multiple preference formats are also used in QFD applications [7,8,14,17,76]. Büyüközkan and Feyzioglu [7] extended the QFD methodology by introducing a GDM approach that takes into account multiple preference formats and fusing different expressions such as preference orderings, utility analysis, optimal subset method, linguistic preference relations and fuzzy pairwise comparisons. Zhang and Chu [76] proposed a study in which the DMs can give their judgments according to two formats: fuzzy pairwise comparisons and linguistic preference relations.In these processes of decision making, complete linguistic preference relations are required from DMs for the evaluation of criteria and alternatives. Sometimes, however, it is difficult to obtain such a preference relation. Since each expert may have his/her own experience, there can be situations of an expert not having a perfect and complete knowledge about the problem to be solved. There may be cases in which an expert would not be able to efficiently express any kind of preference degree between two or more of the available options. This may be due to an expert not having a precise or sufficient level of knowledge of part of the problem or because the expert is unable to determine the degree to which some options are better than others [24]. Since the QFD approach involves multiple DMs and a group decision process, these kinds of problems can occur in the evaluation process of CRs. Thereby beside complete judgments, incomplete judgments are also introduced for linguistic preference relations. With the use of incomplete preference relations, such constraints for evaluations could be handled effectively and the evaluation would be stronger and healthier. It is inherent that every DM in the evaluation group may not have complete information; thus, it is necessary to involve incomplete preferences in the evaluation processes. The literature on the applications using incomplete information is somewhat limited [3,16,24,25,67,69,70]. Recently, Chiclana et al. [12] introduced a study as the comparison of similar methods for estimating missing pairwise preference values ([24] and [16]) based on additive consistency. Wang et al. [65] evaluated the incomplete linguistic preference relations on the performance of web shops. Another study is proposed by Wang and Chen [64] namely, incomplete fuzzy linguistic preference relations under uncertain environments, and they considered a practice for selection of a global supplier. Porcel and Herrera-Viedma [50] suggested a study that deals with incomplete information in a fuzzy linguistic recommender system to disseminate information in university digital libraries. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no study in the literature that neither combines those with QFD, nor any applications in the sustainable SCM field. Fig. 2depicts the integrated approach for QFD.The computational procedure is as follows.Step 1 – “Whats – identifying the CRs”: “Whats” can also be called the voice of customers. In this step CRs must be identified and placed on the left side of the house. These requirements can be identified with the aid of questionnaires to customers, literature surveys, or expert views.Step 2 – “Prioritizing CRs”: In this step, a comparison of the subjected CRs is used to determine their relative importance degrees. These importance degrees of CRs will aid in the design analysis step. However, the information gained from DMs may not be adequate to accurately assign the importance degrees. This paper overcomes this obstacle through fuzzy GDM.Step 2.1 – “Harmonizing dissimilar individual assessments”: The DMs are assumed to give their importance value according to the following formats:(1)They can give an ordered vector (o(1), …, o(N)) where o(i) is the importance ranking (the more important is 1 whereas the least important is N) of CR i. This importance ordering can be transformed into a relative importance relation such that(1)xij=9ui−ujforall1≤i≠j≤Nwhere ui=(N−o(i))/(N−1).They can give an importance degree vector (u1, …, uN) where ui∈[0,1], i=1, …, N. The importance degree uiwill be more significant if it is close to 1. This vector can be transformed into relative importance relation such that(2)xij=uiujforall1≤i≠j≤N.They can give a linguistic importance vector (s1, …, sN) where si, i=1, …, N can be one of “Not Important (NI), Some Important (SI), Moderately Important (MI), Important (I) and Very Important (VI)”. Given a fuzzy triangular number can be noted as (ai,bi,ci) where biis the most encountered value, one possible set of membership functions for these linguistic terms can be NI=(0.00, 0.00, 0.25), SI=(0.00, 0.25, 0.50), MI=(0.25, 0.50, 0.75), I=(0.50, 0.75, 1.00) and VI=(0.75, 1.00, 1.00). Then, the linguistic term vector can be transformed into a relative importance relation such that(3)xij=9bi−bjforall1≤i≠j≤N.They can express that some CRs are more important than others without identifying the degree explicitly. In this case,(4)xij=9andxji=19ifiis more imporant thanjand xij=1 if nothing mentioned.They can prefer to select only a subset of CRs (R′) and argue that they are important for them. For this case, the CRs in the set R′ are equivalent to each other and dominate those in R/R′. The CRs in R/R′ are also equivalent to each other. The preference relation can be defined as(5)xij=9,i∈R′,j∈R/R′1/9,i∈R/R′,j∈R′1,otherwiseforall1≤i≠j≤NThey can prefer to select only a subset of CRsR¯and give the importance of those requirements linguistically. Using the same notation given in (3), the relative importance relation can be defined as(6)xij=9bi−bj,i,j∈R9bi−0.5,i∈R¯,j∈R/R¯1,i,j∈R/R¯forall1≤i≠j≤N.They can give a pair wise comparison matrix where each element represents the relative importance of one CR compared to another. This can be achieved by using the ratio scale originally proposed by Saaty [51]: pij=1 if CR i and j are equally important, while xij=9 if CR i is absolutely much more important than j. Intermediate importance values range from 2 to 8. The matrix is multiplicatively reciprocal, in other words xij=a and xji=1/a for all a∈{1, …, 9}.They can give an incomplete pair wise comparison matrix where some elements can be missing. Firstly, it is required to design a comparison scale to measure the importance degrees of the CRs. Initially, fuzzy linguistic assessment variablesp˜ij=pijl,pijm,piju(Table 1) are used to indicate the relative strength of each pair of elements instead of crisp values pij. Herep˜ijindicates the importance among the compared criteria (importance of i over j) wherepijlandpijuare the lower and upper bounds ofp˜ij, respectively, andpijmis median value where i=j=1, 2, …, n.Once the DMs construct and evaluate the incomplete pairwise comparison matrices of interdependent components, defuzzify evaluated preferences using Eq. (7).(7)Fp˜ij=12∫01infx∈ℜp˜ij+supx∈ℜp˜ijdαThen, missing values in a DM's incomplete preference relation can be computed. Given a reciprocal preference relation, Eqs. (8)–(10) can be used to calculate an estimated value of a preference degree pij(i≠j) using other preference degrees [25]:(1)From pij=piy+pyj−0.5, we obtain the estimate(8)cpijy1=piy+pyj−0.5From pyj=pyi+pij−0.5, we obtain the estimate(9)cpijy2=pyj−pyi+0.5From piy=pij+pjy−0.5, we obtain the estimate(10)cpijy3=piy−pjy+0.5When working with the incomplete preference relation, the following sets can be used to estimate its consistency level:(11)Hij1={y≠i,j|(i,y),(y,j)∈EV}(12)Hij2={y≠i,j|(y,i),(y,j)∈EV}(13)Hij3={y≠i,j|(i,y),(j,y)∈EV}where EV is the set of pairs of alternatives for which the expert provides preference values, andHij1,Hij2,Hij3are the sets of intermediate alternative ay(y≠i, j) that can be used to estimate the preference value pij(i≠j) using Eq. (11)–(13), respectively. The consistency level CLij, associated with a preference value pij(i≠j)∈EV,(14)CLij=1−αij⋅1−εpij+αij⋅CPi+CPj2,αij∈[0,1]is defined as a linear combination of the average of the completeness values associated to the two alternatives involved in that preference degree CPiand CPj,(15)CPi=#EV2(n−1)where #EV is the number of known preference values. Its associated error ɛpijcan be calculated as in Eq. (16)(16)εpij=23⋅εpij1+εpij2+εpij3κwhere(17)εpijh=∑y∈Hijhcpijyh−pij#Hijh,if#Hijh≠0;h∈1,2,30,otherwiseand(18)κ=3,if#Hij1≠0∧#Hij2≠0∧#Hij3≠02,if#Hija=0∧#Hijb≠0∧#Hijc≠01,otherwise.;a,b,c∈1,2,3with αij, a parameter to control the influence of completeness in the evaluation of the consistency levels.(19)αij=1−#EVi+#EVj−#EVi∩EVj4(n−1)−2CLijshould not be less than 0.5 to be able to say that pijis consistent. If pijis not consistent and ɛpij≠0, then preferences should be revised by DM. If pijis not consistent and ɛpij≠0, then known preferences should be increased. Detailed information about incomplete fuzzy preference relations and their mathematical formulations are available in [25].Step 2.2 – “Aggregation of the evaluations”: This process reflects the opinions of the majority of the DMs. Firstly, multiplicative preference matrices acquired from DMs’ evaluations are transformed into fuzzy preferences. Consider a set of alternatives, A={a1, …, an}, associated with a reciprocal multiplicative preference X=(xij) for xij∈[1/9,9]. Then, the corresponding reciprocal fuzzy preference relation, P=(pij) with pij∈[0,1] associated with X is given as pij=g(xij)=1/2(1+log9xij) [77]. Then, letpij1,…,pijKbe the set of values to be aggregated for any i, j∈R and K DMs. Then, the ordered weighted geometric (OWG) operator is defined as:(20)ΦGpij1,pij2,…,pijK=∏k=1Kp¯ijkwkwhere,W=(wk,…,wK)is an exponential weighting vector, such thatwk∈[0,1]and∑wk=1, and eachp¯ijkis the kth largest valued element in the setpij1,…,pijK[22,23,75]. The OWG operator reflects the fuzzy majority if we calculate its weighting vector W by means of a fuzzy linguistic quantifier [72,73]. Traditionally, the majority is defined over a threshold of the number of individuals. In this study, we make use of the fuzzy majority which is a soft majority concept expressed by a fuzzy linguistic quantifier. Proportional quantifiers, such as most, at least half, may be represented by fuzzy subsets of the unit interval, [0,1]. Then, for any r∈[0,1], Q(r) indicates the degree to which the proportion r is compatible with the meaning of the quantifier it represents. For a non-decreasing relative quantifier, Q, the weights are obtained as(21)wk=QkK−Qk−1K,k=1,…,Kwhere Q(t) is defined as [34](22)Q(t)=0,ift<s(t−s)/(v−s),ifs≤t≤v1,ift≥v.Note thats,t,v∈[0,1]and Q(t) indicates the degree to which the proportion y is compatible with the meaning of the quantifier it represents. Some examples for the relative quantifiers are “most” (0.3,0.8), “at least a half” (0,0.5) and “as many as possible” (0.5,1). When the fuzzy quantifier Q is used for calculating the weights of the OWG operatorΦWG, it is represented byΦQG. Therefore, the collective multiplicative relative importance relation is obtained as follows;(23)pij=ΦQGpij1,pij2,…,pijK,1≤i≠j≤n.Step 2.3 – “Obtaining priorities from the judgment matrix”: After the group opinion is collected in the matrix P, it must be exploited to determine the importance weights of the criteria. Note that in P, the element ij reflects the relative importance of criterion i compared to criterion j. Next, calculate the quantifier guided importance degree (QGID) of each criterion, which quantifies the importance of one criterion compared to others in a fuzzy majority sense. By using the OWG operator again, we have(24)QGIDi=ΦQGpij:j=1,…,n.for all i=1, …, n. Finally, the obtained QGIDivalues should be normalized, i.e.,(25)QGIDi=QGIDi∑iQGIDito have the importance degrees in percentage for the group. These steps need to be pursued at all nodes of the evaluation model. The importance degree of each hierarchy leaf node requirement is calculated by multiplying its importance value with the importance values of its up level requirements. Finally, we calculate the weighted sum of CR's group importance values given group importance weights to obtain the aggregate CR importance.Step 3 – “Hows – Developing/defining the DRs”: The first step of the DR part is transforming CRs to technical attributes. DRs are specified on the basis of the company's operational or managerial resource allocation plans in order to satisfy the customers. In defining the DRs, the most important point is finding direct solutions to defined CRs.Step 4 – “Relation matrix”: Here, a relationship matrix is constructed between CRs and DRs. Each of the DRs is correlated individually to each of the CRs by considering to what extent a requirement contributes to meeting customer needs for the attribute. Depending upon the impact of the DRs in meeting CRs for the attribute, values “Empty=no relationship”, “1=possible relationship”, “3=moderate relationship”, and “9=strong relationship” is assigned.Step 5 – “Prioritizing DRs”: The importance of each technical/design requirement is computed using the relationship matrix and the relative importance of each CR. The accuracy of the results in this step relies heavily on the quality of the relationship matrix. This computation process intertwines CRs with DRs. That is, the resulting value determines the relative weight of each DRs as compared to CRs. The importance of each DR is calculated as the sum of each CR importance value multiplied by the quantified relationship between the same CR and the current DR.“Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” This definition was established in 1987 at the World Commission on Environment and Development [66]. It is a rich area for academic research that is still in its infancy and has the potential to affect future government policy, current production operations, and identify new business models. While the first consideration of sustainability can be traced back to practices of many ancient cultures, more recent attention toward sustainability and the environment can be found in the literature [1,2,28,29,31,40,60,63,71]. Different authors and researchers have defined sustainability from similar and different perspectives, driving forces and purposes. However, all sustainability structures have commonly three main pillars, namely economical, environmental and social. Discussions of sustainability are also driven by the basic notion that an SC's performance should be measured not just by profits, but also by the impact of the chain on ecological and social systems [19,32,35,57]. Increasing effort has been directed to the environmental focus through attention to environmental life cycle impacts. Table 2presents overview of some study focuses in the literature associated with “sustainability” and “SC” (Table 2).Recently there has been increasing emphasis on the necessity for introducing environmental or sustainable requirements into design and development of products/systems. Industries and designers have therefore found themselves faced with the necessity to adopt new tools and reference parameters for production and design. The question of how to infuse these criteria into product/system design and how to compare sustainable requirements with traditional design requirements is gaining vital importance and it can effectively be solved by QFD approach [62]. In particular by using the multiple criteria matrices of QFD, an ‘environmental compromise’ can be reached. Some researchers have been working on incorporating environmental aspects into QFD [8,37,40,42,52,63]. Typically the sustainability literature only takes into account a single product. The procedure proposed in this work, allows the definition of guidelines for the whole SC. This is useful in order to provide “Engineering Design Characteristics” information about the sustainable SC design for DMs.According to literature survey based on sustainability related studies, the characteristics of effective sustainability indicators are determined as follows.Drivers for a sustainable SC (CRs):•Economical requirements [9,21,39,56,58,61,63]: The requirements of the firm arising from advanced environmental management practice can include: cost reduction, asset use/utilization, quality improvement, and enhanced customer service. There is no doubt that these factors that ensure cost reduction and continuing financial benefit are fundamental goals of SCM.Environmental requirements [39,41,60,61]: The major four economical requirements dimensions are waste reduction, emission reduction, energy efficiency and natural resource conservation. These are the environmental based expectations of companies and their stakeholders to form a sustainable SC. The environmental practices depend on wider aspects to be integrated in order to achieve firm's goal of waste elimination and lower environmental impact. Hence, firms must integrate environmental aspects to ensure corporate survival and toward sustainable development.Social requirements [2,6,9,19,44,63]: Social requirements comprise four main dimensions such as reduced impact on community, health and safety, strengthened relationships and laws and regulations. In response to governmental regulations, and increasing public awareness and customer pressure, for the effect of industrial production on the environment; organizations are now taking major initiatives on to transform their SC processes.Key practices for a sustainable SC (DRs):•Price strategy[19,21,43]: As a customary criterion, price strategy is again an important practice as in traditional SC. The objective is to ensure a minimum price of the product to increase the customer satisfaction and profitability.SC optimization[31,45,49]: Optimization of SC logistics network design; warehouse layout and workflow; transportation loads and routes are common incentives for a sustainable SC. In sustainable SCs the strategic optimization of the SC design and product design must be intrinsically linked.Inventory management[45,49,53]: Inventory effectiveness and supply steadiness are important as excess inventory and low inventory turnover can result from poor management of reorder points, order quantities, storage locations, or data.Forecast accuracy[45,49,53]: Increasing the accuracy of supply and demand forecasts can reduce waste and inventory along the SC, increase SC visibility and responsiveness and enhance customer service.Lifecycle management[45,49,53]: The necessity of considering the total product life-cycle in order to evaluate a product's sustainability is well recognized [31].Supplier management[26,53,60]: Duty for supplier qualification, supplier selection and developing, supplier integration in sustainability, supporting suppliers with environmental and social problems are some key practices for supplier management.Flexible and cleaner technology[39,41,60,61]: Cleaner technologies extract and use natural resources more efficiently, generate products with fewer harmful components, minimize pollutant releases to air, water and soil during manufacturing and product use, and design durable goods that can be reused or recycled [47].Delivery performance[39,53,61]: The ability to follow the predefined delivery schedule is always an important criterion for the selection. Capability of on time delivery and on time response to request is traditionally important factors for a qualified sustainable SC.Usage of effective systems and tools[45,49,60]: Using effective software, accounting systems, management tools, decision support tools play important role in sustainable SC design to use capacity more efficiently.Environmental management system[39,41,56,77]: This factor should include environmental policies, implementation and certifications [15]. One of the most widely utilized standards is the environmental management system standard ISO 14001, which was introduced in 1996 and updated in 2004.Green innovation[6,46,59]: Research and development (R&D) activities, R&D strategy that explicitly accounts for eco-efficiency of products and technologies.Environmental product design[60,62,77]: A good product design have to avoid the need for using hazardous or restricted materials during the manufacturing process and have to minimize waste during the manufacturing process [30].Environmental activity capability[31,41,60]: It is characterized by the capability to perform activities such as reduce, remanufacture, recover, reuse, and recycle.Efficient handling and storage[45,49,53,60]: Where the use of non-hazardous alternatives is not an option, safe handling and storage of hazardous materials is essential to prevent worker health and safety issues, operational downtime, environmental contamination from spills or leaks, higher insurance premiums, and higher environmental permitting costs.Eco-friendly transportation[6,56]: Eco-friendly transportation includes shifting to modes or equipment that use less fossil fuel, using reusable or recyclable shipping materials and transporting hazardous materials safely.Reverse logistics[45,49,53,60,77]: It is the process of moving goods back through the system with the purpose of finding another use for the products or for proper disposal. Green and back packaging[52,53,60,77]: Green and back packaging to facilitate safe, efficient, and cost-effective recovery and disassembly for reuse of recycling can reduce materials usage.Collaboration with partners[27,41,53,61]: Developing and maintaining a supply relationship can be achieved through either collaboration or compliance.Employee practices[6,41,60,61]: Employee practices such as certification programs for employees, labor education, effective precautions for accidents, etc. are also important for a sustainable SC design and it is in relationship with vital factors such as laws and regulation, health and safety, improved quality.Outsourcing[45,49]: Third parties can generate economies of scale that individual manufacturers or retailers often cannot. Managed well, such partnerships can result in cost reduction, increased efficiency and significant improvement in customer satisfaction.Stakeholders’ rights[41,45,77]: A successful sustainable SCM should include protecting stakeholder's rights (i.e., suppliers, employees, customers, etc.) as duties of ethics, loyalty and care. It's mainly related to corporate governance aspect.Monitoring and maintenance[61,77]: Nowadays, corporations need to implement control and monitoring activities to ensure that their suppliers, partners act in environmentally-sensitive manner. This is usually part of a due diligence and risk minimization strategy [39].The selected company for application of the SQFD is HAVI Logistics Turkey. HAVI Logistics has been following the goals associated with sustainable development. Being a company with global reach, they are well aware of the impact that their businesses can have on the environments in which we all work and live. The company considers environment and sustainability issues in the framework of social responsibility.HAVI Logistics is “The Global Lead Logistics Provider” for food and non-food logistics. They handle all services throughout the SC and create genuine added value for their customers through their logistics solutions. With their end to end solution philosophy, their integrated supply and transparency HAVI Logistics frees their customers from all SC related logistics responsibilities. More than 6000 employees work today for HAVI Logistics worldwide. Besides many brands, company commonly serves McDonald's.The principle of sustainability – the equilibrium between and the integration of economic, ecological and social goals and thus the acceptance of social responsibility – is not new terrain for the HAVI Logistics. Naturally, it is not sufficient simply to recognize the consequences of such a responsibility. In contrast, putting the principle of sustainability into practice is a basic part of their business thinking. The company has exercised such diligence for over 25 years.To illustrate the proposed approach, a meeting is arranged with the firm. Project team (DM group) especially formed for this application includes two local process engineers and manager director of HAVI Logistics Turkey.Step 1 – Identifying CRs: CRs can be considered as company requirements. Either customers/stakeholders or companies have common requirements from a sustainable SC. The generic SQFD structure constructed based on literature survey in Section 3.3, is discussed with respect to company targets. Project team considered the proposed SQFD structure adequate. No revisions are done for CRs.Step 2 – Priority analysis:Step 2.1 – Harmonizing dissimilar individual assessments: For illustrative purposes, evaluations of the group for the purpose of measuring the importance degrees among first level CRs are given:DM1 provides an ordered importance vector {1, 2, 2}.DM2 gives an importance degree vector {0.4, 0.3, 0.3}.DM3 provides the following incomplete comparison matrix.EconomicalEnvironmentalSocialEconomical–FGFGEnvironmentalx–xSocialxx–By using formats 1, 2 and 8, the preference relation matrices are computed.Format 1: The importance ordering of DM1 can be transformed into a relative importance relation as shown in Table 3.As an instance, p12 is computed as: x12=9u1−u2=9̶0.5=3, where u1=(3−1)/2=1 and u2=(3−2)/2=0.5.Format 2: The importance degree vector of DM2 can be transformed into a relative importance relation as shown in Table 4.As an instance, p12 is computed as: p12=ui/uj=0.4/0.3=1.33.Format 8: The incomplete preference matrix of DM3 can be transformed into a relative importance relation as follows.Missing values are completed using Eq. (7). Table 5shows the defuzzified incomplete preferences of the group. Eqs. (8)–(10) are used to estimate the missing values shown in Table 6.For instance, defuzzified incomplete evaluation of DM1 is calculated as:F(p˜12)=F(p˜13)=12∫01(0.5+0.9)dα12×1.4α∫01=0.70Iteration 1.

After these elements have been estimated, we haveH211=∅ascp2131=p23+p31−0.5=unknownH212=∅ascp2132=p31−p32+0.5=unknownH213={1}ascp2133=p23−p13+0.5=0.50−0.70+0.50=0.30,thereby=0.30.H311=∅ascp3121=p32+p21−0.5=0.50+0.30−0.50=0.30H312={1}ascp3122=p21+p23−0.5=0.30−0.50+0.50=0.30H313=∅ascp3123=p32−p12+0.5=0.5−0.7+0.5=0.10,therebycp32=0.30.Lastly, consistency is checked after missing values are treated. The corresponding consistency level matrix is shown in Table 7.As an instance for p12, the consistency level, calculated using Eqs. (11)–(19), is as follows.EV1={(1,2),(1,3)};EV2={(1,2)};EV3={(1,3)}.CP1=24,CP2=14,CP3=14.α12=1−2+1−143−1−2=0.67p12is given by DM and is not estimated, ɛp12=0.CL12=1−0.67⋅1−0+0.67⋅2/4+1/42=0.58.Step 2.2 – “Aggregation of the evaluations”: After first two multiplicative preference matrices are transformed into fuzzy preference matrices, evaluations can be aggregated. For instance considering the evaluation matrix of DM1 in Table 4,p12=gx12=1/2(1+log9(3.00))=0.75. Taking into account all matrices obtained from project group, using of Eqs. (21) and (22), the OWG operator with fuzzy linguistic quantifier ‘at least half – (0,0.5)’ is obtained with weighting vector (0.667, 0.333, 0.000). Then, these weighting vectors are used to compute the group importance relation matrix as shown in Table 8using Eqs. (20) and (23).w1=Q13−Q0=(1/3)−00.5−0−0=0.667w2=Q23−Q13=1−0.667=0.333w3=Q1−Q23=1−1=0.000As an exemplary for calculation,ΦQGp121,p122,p123=∏k=13p¯12kwk=0.750.666×0.570.334×0.700.000=0.73.Step 2.3 - “Obtaining priorities from the judgment matrix”: Eq. (24) is used to compute group aggregated importance values with weighting vector (0.000, 0.333, 0.667) corresponding to the fuzzy linguistic quantifier ‘as many as possible – (0.5,1)’.w1=Q13−Q0=0−0=0.000w2=Q23−Q13=(2/3−0.5)(1−0.5)−0.000=0.333w3=Q1−Q23=1−0.333=0.666While the quantifier at least half enables us to aggregate highest scores by ignoring lowest values, the quantifier as many as possible us to aggregate lowest scores by ignoring highest values. Then, the obtained importance values are normalized using Eq. (25), and the collaborative importance values are calculated as (0.40, 0.30, 0.30). The procedure is as follows.QGID1=ΦQGp11,p12,p13=QGID1=0.730.000×0.730.333×0.500.667=0.567QGID2=ΦQGp21,p22,p23=QGID2=0.500.000×0.500.333×0.380.667=0.419QGID3=ΦQGp31,p32,p33=QGID3=0.500.000×0.500.333×0.380.667=0.419.QGIDi=QGIDi/∑iQGIDiQGID1=0.567/(0.567+0.419+0.419)=0.40QGID2=0.419/(0.567+0.419+0.419)=0.30QGID3=0.419/(0.567+0.419+0.419)=0.30.Using the same reasoning, second level factors are evaluated and priorities are determined as in Table 9. Multiplying first level values with each of the secondary importance values produces the global importance vectors.Step 3 – “Defining DRs”: DRs are listed as in the generic SQFD model constructed based on literature survey in Section 3.3. No revisions are done for DRs.Step 4 – “Relation matrix”: The project team constructed a matrix and assigned relationship s between CRs and DRs. The accuracy of the results relies heavily on the quality of the relationship matrix. Thereby, project team discussed the relations in depth and reached a consensus decision. Relation matrix can be seen from the final SQFD matrix in Table 10.Step 5 – “Prioritizing DRs”: The importance of each DRs is computed with respect to the relationship matrix and the relative importance of each CR. As an instance for this computation process, importance weight of “price strategy DR” is calculated as (3×0.088)+(9×0.036)=0.588 which corresponds to 0.008 percentile. Step 5 can be seen again from the final HOQ matrix in Table 10.According to the application at HAVI Logistics Turkey, the results show that top 5 key practices for the company to design a sustainable SC structure are:Employee practices with 11.34%.Environmental management system with 7.35%.Efficient handling and storage 7.30%.Monitoring and maintenance 7.00%, andSC optimization 6.54%.
