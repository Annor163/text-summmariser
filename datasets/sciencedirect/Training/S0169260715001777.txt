@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common type of abnormal heartbeat. Without early diagnosis and proper treatment, PVC may result in serious harms. Diagnosis of PVC is of great importance in goal-directed treatment and preoperation prognosis. This paper proposes a novel diagnostic method for PVC based on Lyapunov exponents of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. The methodology consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and classification integrated into the system. PVC beats can be classified and differentiated from other types of abnormal heartbeats by analyzing Lyapunov exponents and training a learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network. Our algorithm can obtain a good diagnostic result with little features by using single lead ECG data. The sensitivity, positive predictability, and the overall accuracy of the automatic diagnosis of PVC is 90.26%, 92.31%, and 98.90%, respectively. The effectiveness of the new method is validated through extensive tests using data from MIT-BIH database. The experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient and robust.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) can be observed in both normal people and patients with coronary heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, and hypertensive heart disease. PVC has caused extensive concern as a common, frequent arrhythmia. Frequent PVC is often associated with complications like syncope, angina, cardiomyopathy and heart failure [1]. The prevalence of PVCs varies greatly, with estimates of less than 3% to more than 60% in asymptomatic individuals [2]. Diagnosis of PVCs plays an important role in the early warning of cardiovascular diseases, which can help patients get timely and active treatment. Because of the randomness and uncertainty in the occurrence of PVC, the diagnosis of PVC needs observation of dynamic ECG during a long period, which may overload physicians with large amount of ECG data. To reduce the workload on physicians and to improve the efficiency of PVC diagnosis, computerized automatic identification techniques [3–5] have been developed for many years.Martis et al. used Gaussian mixture model to classify ECG signals [6], and later they used higher order spectra for cardiac decision making [7]. In [8], Hickey et al. proposed to discern PVC and premature atrial contraction (PAC) beats using morphological indices such as the width, amplitude, and the area of the QRS complexes. However, one major concern of the proposed method is that its effect can be easily affected by noise. An automated diagnostic system is proposed in [9] using type-2 fuzzy clustering neural network. This system effectively combined type-2 fuzzy c-means clustering (T2FCM) algorithm with neural network. ECG signals can be classified by the cluster centers that may converge to a more desirable location. The system performs well on the classification of fuzzy boundary data. In [10], an arrhythmia classification scheme is developed which uses principal component analysis (PCA) with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for feature reduction, and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier to differentiate eight types of ECG beats. In [11], discrete wavelet transforms is proposed to classify ECG signals, where linear discriminant analysis and a multi-layer perceptron are used as classifiers. The neural network is trained by the back-propagation and a genetic algorithm. The results indicate that wavelet optimization may improve the classification capability of a neural network. In [12], a new supervised noise-artifact-robust heart arrhythmia fusion classification method is introduced. This method consists of structurally diverse classifiers with a new QRS complex geometrical feature extraction technique.An interesting development is the application of the chaos theory in the processing of biomedical signals, particularly ECG analysis. As human heart is a complex system, the heartbeat signal naturally exhibits some chaotic characteristics [13,16]. It is noteworthy that methods for the study and classification of nonlinear system through the analysis of one observable are increasingly used in ECG analysis [15]. In [16], 14 features (time domain, frequency domain, nonlinear and chaotic features) are carefully selected and used to train MLP neural networks in order to classify 7 arrhythmias. In [17], the nonlinear dynamics tools are used to differentiate four types of ECG beats. The research demonstrates that the Lyapunov exponents are important features for representing the ECG signals, and the recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on these features is able to achieve high classification accuracies.In general, existing methods need to extract multiple features from the ECG signal to deal with the influence of noise. In this paper, we present a novel method for PVC diagnosis with few features based on Lyapunov exponents of the ECG signal. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement. It can also achieve more accurate and robust results in PVC diagnosis as shown in our experimental study.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes details of the proposed method. Experimental results and discussion are described in Section 3. Conclusions and future work are described in Section 4.
