@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents an improved wave-based bilateral teleoperation scheme for rehabilitation therapies assisted by robot manipulators. The main feature of this bilateral teleoperator is that both robot manipulators, master and slave, are controlled by impedance. Thus, a pair of motion-based adaptive impedance controllers are integrated into a wave-based configuration, in order to guarantee a stable human–robot interaction and to compensate the position drift, characteristic of the available schemes of bilateral teleoperation. Moreover, the teleoperator stability, in the presence of time delays in the communication channel, is guaranteed because the wave-variable approach is included to encode the force and velocity signals. It should be noted that the proposed structure enables the implementation of several teleoperator schemes, from passive therapies, without the intervention of a human operator on the master side, to fully active therapies where both manipulators interact with humans in a stable manner. The suitable performance of the proposed teleoperator is verified through some results obtained from the simulation of the passive and active-constrained modes, by considering typical tasks in motor-therapy rehabilitation, where an improved behavior is observed when compared to implementations of the classical wave-based approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The world population over 65 years is increasing rapidly, approximately 70 percent by 2050 and up to 200 percent in industrialized countries, according to studies carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. It should be noted that people in this group are highly prone to a stroke. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries are the main causes of disability. CVA patients represent the largest group; e.g. in the United States, 750000 individuals are affected every year [2]. This is why there exists a growing need to care for all these patients and provide the appropriate rehabilitation therapy, in order to enable them to recover their motor skills.The recovery process of neurological patients is often long and tedious, which is why it is very important to design suitable strategies for motivating and influencing their behavior during therapy sessions. Recent results show that a strong engagement and attention during the learning of new motor skills, or the re-learning of forgotten skills, is crucial for inducing cerebral plasticity after neurological impairment [3]. During motor rehabilitation therapy, a specific set of tasks are performed repetitively, i.e. the patient should perform repetitive exercises of physiological motion patterns with the affected limbs, as frequently and intensely as possible [2]. Classical physiotherapy has shown practical limitations in such tasks, mainly due to extreme exhaustion of therapists during training sessions when guided manually. Therefore, the repetitive nature of the therapy process has led to the use of specialized robotic systems as one of the most promising approaches for improving limb rehabilitation after stroke.A wealth of robotic devices for rehabilitation have been developed to assist stroke survivors during treatment of motor recovery [4–11]. One of the earliest and pioneer robots for upper limb rehabilitation is MIT-MANUS, which consists of a two-degree-of-freedom system for the movement of shoulder and elbow. It can guide or perturb the upper-limb motion during pre-defined tasks. This assistive device has been tested in several clinical studies, the results have validated that it has no adverse effects and enables improved motor recovery processes [4,12–14]. A key challenge is to develop robotic therapy systems that are affordable and usable in different environments such as rehabilitation centers and home, due to the increasing demand for rehabilitation services [15].The vast majority of rehabilitation centers and therapists tend to be located in central areas. Therefore, a lot of disabled people living in sparsely populated districts often lack appropriate rehabilitation programs [16]. A possible reduction in attention and duration of therapy would have a negative impact on the patient's condition and his/her recovery process; in fact, the evaluation and treatment must occur as soon as possible, or else the same duration of therapy may produce limited results. Such problems often occur in patients who live in remote rural areas or deprived urban areas, where generally there are no clinics in the vicinity of the patient's home [17]. Under these circumstances, a telerehabilitation system that allows the patient to participate in a rehabilitation program in a remote location becomes a very useful technological tool. Specifically, the robotic-assisted telerehabilitation allows for interactive and innovative therapy tasks that can be implemented from site to site, getting significant benefits for stroke survivors with upper- and lower-limb impairments [15]. Additionally, training at home through telerehabilitation has the potential of saving time and money for both the patient and the provider; moreover, the same therapist can supervise several patients who exercise simultaneously through a multiplexed setting [18].A teleoperator or teleoperation system consists of a pair of robot manipulators connected in such a way that a human operator, handling the master-manipulator, operates in a remote environment via the slave-manipulator [19]. It is well known that adding force feedback in teleoperators avoids high contact forces, which can achieve low energy consumption, less number of errors and complete tasks in a shorter time [20]. Therefore, force feedback improves the operator's ability to perform complex tasks; in this case, the system is referred to as bilateral teleoperator. The desired goal for the slave robot is to follow the master's behavior in terms of force, position and velocity; and under ideal conditions, this goal is easy to accomplish. An important consideration in the development of remote physical therapies with transparent haptic feeling is that the stability and transparency of the teleoperation system will be harmed by the inherent time delay involved in communications between the therapist (master) and the patient (slave) located in a local clinic or home. This time delay, in the transmission channel between the local and remote environments, can cause instability [21]. Control and stability of bilateral teleoperators with time delay have been tackled by several researchers: a control law based on passivity and scattering theory, that guarantee the stability of a bilateral teleoperator, was proposed in [22]; whereas the wave-variable concept, which is a method based on passivity theory, was presented in [23]. This wave transformation has been implemented in teleoperated systems and satisfactory results have been obtained [24,25]. Recently, an extension of the wave-variable approach, using contraction theory, is proposed in order to study the stability of interacting nonlinear systems in group cooperation [26]. On the other hand, a modification of the wave-variable method with better force tracking and improving the phase delay induced by the latency in the communication network, is presented in [27].Internet-based teleoperation is becoming very attractive since it allows the increasing of the number of potential applications and an economic installation. However, one of its main drawbacks is the variable time delays in data transmission. Several wave-based approaches have been proposed in order to preserve the stability. In particular, by ensuring the passivity via conservative energy filters [24] or time varying gains [28,29], and handling packet looses and blackouts [30,31]. Recently, an experimental comparison study was presented [32], where the approach proposed by [24] achieved the best performance. However, in all the control schemes evaluated during the study, an increment of tracking and force errors were observed in the presence of variable and large time delays. In this paper, in order to guarantee a stable human–robot interaction, and to improve the force tracking while compensating for the position drift, a motion-based impedance controller is integrated into a wave-based bilateral teleoperator.Several kinds of telerehabilitation systems have been proposed, e.g. for improved motion tracking [1], for remote therapy with force feedback [20], for remote evaluation and diagnosis [33,34,16], using wave variables in the presence of time delay [35], collaborative telerehabilitation [36], virtual reality integrated systems [17,37,18], and for assistive therapy considering the therapist as an active element [38]. Recently, in order to decrease the influence of external forces, a novel scaling method in bilateral control was proposed in [39], enabling the operator to feel the environmental force more appropriately. Also, in order to improve the haptic sensing in a rehabilitation robot, a robust bilateral control scheme with a Kalman-Filter based state observer was presented [40]. In addition, innovative tools for stability analysis in haptic teleoperation systems have been successfully tested [41,42] and currently represent very attractive methods for use in robotic rehabilitation. Now, in order to create a versatile framework for implementing passive and active exercises in remote rehabilitation therapy, this paper aims to integrate adaptive impedance controllers on both sides of a wave-base bilateral teleoperator; and thus, this scheme addresses three major problems: the presence of time delays in communication by using wave variables, errors in path tracking with an adaptive motion-based controller, and human–robot interaction and force tracking with impedance control. Computer simulation tests corroborate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.The following mathematical background and concepts represent the theoretical basis on which the stability analysis of the proposed scheme is supported.The joint-space dynamics of a n-link constrained rigid robot manipulator, interacting with the environment in an m-dimensional task space, can be written as(1)M(qR)q¨R+C(qR,q˙R)q˙R+g(qR)+Fq˙R=τ−JT(qR)fewhereqR,q˙Randq¨R∈ℝnrepresent the joint position, velocity and acceleration vectors, respectively;M(qR)∈ℝn×nis the symmetric positive definite inertia matrix,C(qR,q˙R)∈ℝn×nis the Coriolis and centripetal acceleration matrix,g(qR)∈ℝnis the vector of gravitational torques,Fq˙Ris the vector of viscous friction, withF∈ℝn×nbeing a positive definite constant diagonal matrix whose entries satisfy fi>0, i=1, …, n, and represent the viscous friction coefficients, whereasfe∈ℝmdenotes the vector of contact forces andJ(qR) is the manipulator Jacobian matrix [43].Some well-known properties characterizing the terms of such a dynamical model are recalled here (see for instance [44]).Property 1M(qR) is a symmetric, positive definite bounded matrix, i.e. μmI≤M(qR)≤μMI,∀qR∈ℝn, for some constants 0<μm≤μM. Then for any position vectorqR, there exists a symmetric, positive definite matrixM−1(qR) that represents the inverse ofM(qR).Property 2For allqR,q˙R,q¨R∈ℝnit holds that(2)M(qR)q¨R+C(qR,q˙R)q˙R+g(qR)+Fq˙R=Yd(qR,q˙R,q¨R)θdwhereYd(qR,q˙R,q¨R)∈ℝn×pis a regression matrix and the vectorθd=[θd1,θd2,…,θdp]T∈ℝpdepends only on the dynamic parameters of the manipulator. Moreover, ifqR,q˙R,q¨R∈L∞nthenYd(qR,q˙R,q¨R)∈L∞n×p.Note thatJ(qR) has to be a full-rank matrix for all position vectorsqRin order to have a singularity-free workspace for the robot manipulator. Thus, the following assumption turns out to be crucial for the subsequent derivations.Assumption 1rank{J(qR)}=nThe human arm can be modeled by a nonlinear second-order differential equation, under the consideration of a system of rigid bodies with two degrees of freedom in the horizontal plane (Fig. 1a) as [45,46](3)M(qH)q¨H+c(q˙H,qH)=τin(q˙H,qH,uH)+τextwhereqH,q˙Handq¨Hare the vectors of position, velocity and acceleration, respectively;τinrepresents the torques generated by the muscles,uHis the motor command of central nervous system;τextare external torques; andM(qH) andc(q˙H,qH)denote the inertia matrix and the vector of Coriolis and centripetal forces, respectively, given by(4)M(qH)=θH1+2θH2cos(qH2)θH3+θH2cos(qH2)θH3+θH2cos(qH2)θH3,c(q˙H,qH)=−θH2[q˙H22+2q˙H1q˙H2]sin(qH2)θH2q˙H12sin(qH2)withqH1andqH2representing the shoulder and elbow positions, respectively (qH=[qH1qH2]T);θH1=mH1lHc12+mH2(lH12+lHc22)+IH1+IH2,θH2=mH2lH1lHc2andθH3=mH2lHc22+IH2, wheremH1ymH2denote the arm and forearm mass,lHc1andlHc2represent the distance from every joint to the center of mass,IH1andIH2are the inertia moments, andlH1is the arm length.On the other hand, the viscosity and stiffness properties of the muscle can be represented as(5)−∂τin∂q˙H≡D=DssDseDesDee,−∂τin∂qH≡R=RssRseResReewhere the subscripts ss and ee denote the effects of monoarticular muscles of shoulder and elbow, respectively; whereas se and es are the effects of biarticular muscles.Wave variablesuandvare used in place of the more conventional power variables such as velocityx˙and forcef. Niemeyer and Slotine [23] defined right moving waves to be positive and left moving waves to be negative. Therefore, the equations that govern the transmission process are(6)us(t)=um(t−Tr)(7)vm(t)=vs(t−Tl)where Trrepresents the time delay from the master to the slave and Tlrepresents the other time delay in the backward direction, subscript m corresponds to the master manipulator while s corresponds to the slave-manipulator. The wave transformations are given by(8)um(t)=bx˙m(t)+fm(t)2b(9)vs(t)=bx˙s(t)−fs(t)2bwhere the characteristic wave impedance b is a positive constant or a symmetric positive definite matrix and assumes the role of a tuning parameter, trading off speed of motion against level of forces. As presented in [25], the wave-variable approach is stable as the wave energy is temporarily stored while the waves are in transit, making the communication passive.The impedance-control approach used in this paper corresponds to a generalization of motion control in task-space, by choosing a desired trajectoryxd. It attempts to maintain the following dynamic relationship,(10)xd−xR=F(s)fewherexR∈ℝmrepresents the position of the robot's end-effector in the task space, s denotes the differential operator and(11)F(s)=[s2Md+sBd+Kd]−1represents the operator related to a second-order multi-dimensional filter withKd,Bd,Md∈ℝm×mbeing diagonal, positive definite matrices of stiffness, damping and inertia, respectively, i.e.Kd=diag[kd1, …, kdm],Bd=diag[bd1, …, bdm] andMd=diag[md1, …, mdm] with kdi>0, bdi>0 and mdi>0 ∀i=1, …, m, such that (see Ref. [47])(12)bdi≥4kdimdiThenF(s)is a stable, second-order linear filter.The impedance errorξ˜∈ℝmcan be defined as [48]:(13)ξ˜=x˜−xfewherex˜=xd−xRrepresents the unconstrained tracking error andxfe=F(s)feis the adjustment vector obtained from the filtered external contact forces.Formally, the aim of our impedance-control approach consists of selectingτin such a way that:(14)limt→∞ξ˜(t)=0(15)limt→∞ξ˜˙(t)=0.Note that in the absence of contact, i.e. iffe≡0, the objective of impedance control is equivalent to the objective of motion control in task-space. Therefore, this approach to impedance control can be seen as a motion-control approach allowing a tolerance to error in the tracking of the desired trajectory, in the presence of interaction forces.The adaptive impedance control structure (Fig. 1b) used in this paper is based on the concept of inverse dynamics [49], where the robot torques are selected as(16)τ=Mˆ0(qR)J−1(qR)[a−J˙(qR)q˙R]+Cˆ(qR,q˙R)q˙R+gˆ(qR)+Fˆq˙R+JT(qR)fe+δMwhereMˆ0(qR)is a symmetric, definite positive matrix that represents the initial estimate ofM(qR) withθˆd0being the initial estimate ofθd;Cˆ(qR,q˙R),gˆ(qR)andFˆrepresent the estimates ofC(qR,q˙R),g(qR) andF, respectively, withθˆdbeing the current estimated value ofθd, and coming from the following auxiliary dynamics(17)θˆ˙d=ΓdΦdT(qR,q˙R,q¨R)Md(ξ˜+ξ˜˙)whereΦd(qR,q˙R,q¨R)=J(qR)Mˆ0−1(qR)Yd(qR,q˙R,q¨R), andΓd∈ℝp×pis a diagonal, positive definite matrix of tuning parameters.

(1), (16), (18) and (20), the following dynamical system is obtained(21)(M−Mˆ)q¨R+(C−Cˆ)q˙R+(g−gˆ)+(F−Fˆ)q˙R=Mˆ0J−1[x¨d−x¨fe+Md−1(KPξ˜+KDξ˜˙)−J˙q˙R]−Mˆ0q¨RYdθ˜d=Mˆ0J−1[x¨d−x¨fe+Md−1(KPξ˜+KDξ˜˙)−J˙q˙R−Jq¨R]Φdθ˜d=ξ˜¨+Md−1(KPξ˜+KDξ˜˙)whereθ˜d=θd−θˆd. Then, the closed-loop dynamics take the following form(22a)ξ˜¨=Φdθ˜d−Md−1(KPξ˜+KDξ˜˙)(22b)θ˜˙d=−ΓdΦdTMd(ξ˜+ξ˜˙)Note that, from Eqs. (22) under stationary conditions, i.e. by consideringξ˜¨=ξ˜˙=0andθ˜˙d=0, we have thatΦdθ˜d=Md−1KPξ˜ΦdTMdξ˜=0and by combining these conditionsξ˜TMdΦdθ˜d=ξ˜TMdMd−1KPξ˜⇒θ˜dTΦdTMdξ˜=ξ˜TKPξ˜⇒ξ˜TKPξ˜=0Then, by considering Assumption 1,ξ˜=0is an equilibrium condition, while for the estimation errorθ˜dturns out to be defined by the solutions of the equationΦdθ˜d=0, and consequentlyθ˜d∈ker(Φd).Now, in order to carry out the stability analysis, the following scalar function is defined(23)V(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)=12ɛTXɛ+θ˜dTΓd−1θ˜d+ξ˜TKPξ˜whereɛ=[ξ˜Tξ˜˙T]TandX=KDMdMdMdObserve that by using Schur complement [50]X>0⇔Md>0andKD−MdMd−1Md>0and the positivity ofXis equivalent to the positivity ofMdandKD−Md. SinceMdandKDare diagonal, positive definite matrices such that inequality (19) is satisfied, thenX>0. From the quadratic form of the remaining terms,V(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)is concluded to be positive definite. Additionally, notice thatɛTXɛ→∞ as∥ξ˜∥→∞,ɛTXɛ→∞ as∥ξ˜˙∥→∞,θ˜dTΓd−1θ˜d→∞as∥θ˜d∥→∞andξ˜TKPξ˜→∞as∥ξ˜∥→∞, which prove thatV(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)is radially unbounded [51].Thereafter, the derivative ofV(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)along the system trajectories is given by(24)V˙(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)=ξ˜TKDξ˜˙+ξ˜TMdξ˜¨+ξ˜˙TMdξ˜˙+ξ˜˙TMdξ˜¨+θ˜dTΓd−1θ˜˙d+ξ˜TKPξ˜˙=ξ˜TKDξ˜˙+(ξ˜+ξ˜˙)TMd[Φdθ˜d−Md−1(KPξ˜+KDξ˜˙)]+ξ˜˙TMdξ˜˙−θ˜dTΦdTMd(ξ˜+ξ˜˙)+ξ˜TKPξ˜˙=−ξ˜TKPξ˜−ξ˜˙T(KD−Md)ξ˜˙whereξ˜¨andθ˜˙dhave been replaced by the expressions (22a) and (22b) from the closed-loop dynamics. Therefore, under Assumption 1 and the inequality (19),V˙(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)≤0∀(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)∈ℝm×ℝm×ℝp, withV˙(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)=0⇔(ξ˜,ξ˜˙)=(0,0).Now, the second derivative ofV(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)along the system trajectories is given by(25)V¨(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)=−2ξ˜TKPξ˜˙−2ξ˜˙T(KD−Md)ξ˜¨=−2ξ˜TKPξ˜˙−2ξ˜˙T(KD−Md)[Φdθ˜d−Md−1(KPξ˜+KDξ˜˙)]Assume thatxd,x˙d,x¨d,fe∈L∞m. Then, from Eq. (24)V˙(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)≤0⇒ξ˜,ξ˜˙∈L2m∩L∞mandθ˜d∈L∞p. Further, from Eq. (13) we have thatξ˜,ξ˜˙∈L∞m⇒x˜,xfe,x˜˙,x˙fe∈L∞mandxR,x˙R∈L∞m. Also, from the corresponding kinematic relationships we have thatxR,x˙R∈L∞m⇒qR,q˙R∈L∞nand under Assumption 1,J(qR) is a bounded nonsingular matrix. SinceMˆ0−1is bounded according to Property 1 and from the previous results and Property 2,Φdis a bounded matrix. Therefore, with bounded gain matricesKP,KDandMd,V¨(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)∈L∞and according to Barbalat's Lemma [52],ξ˜→0andξ˜˙→0as t→∞, which completes the proof.Traditionally, the bilateral teleoperators include classical proportional-derivative (PD) or proportional-integral (PI) controllers, which are suitable for unconstrained robot regulation. However, they present many limitations for interaction tasks because the contact forces are not properly regulated. In order to improve the performance in bilateral teleoperation for human–robot interaction and compensate the position drift, the impedance-control algorithm (16) is integrated in a wave-based teleoperator. The system also includes the wave-variable transformation in order to guarantee the stability in the communications in the presence of time delay.In this bilateral teleoperation scheme, the master and slave behaviors are regulated by using the impedance controller. A path-planner can be used to determine the master desired motion (xmd,x˙md) and the human-operator forcefhcan modify it at any time, thus the impedance controller (16) regulate the trajectoryxmand velocityx˙mto be followed by the master-manipulator. Then, the position and velocity are encoded using the wave transformation and sent to the slave-manipulator using the communication channel. On the other side, the desired positionxsdand velocityx˙sdfor the slave-manipulator are obtained from the wave transformation. The desired position and velocity are processed by the impedance controller (16) in order to generate a suitable slave's motion, even when the slave-manipulator interacts with the environment and contact forcesfeare generated (in typical wave-based bilateral teleoperators, the force feedback is generated by the controller; when the slave robot interacts with its environment, the tracking errorx˜is increased and the contact force can be perceived from the master's side thanks to the corresponding increment of the feedback force generated by the controller. In this case, an impedance controller is used into a wave-based configuration, and because the impedance controller regulates the robot–environment interaction, the impedance errorξ˜tends to zero and does not have a significant increase to generate the required change on the force feedback). The impedance-controller force is given by(26)fc=KPξ˜+KDξ˜˙.This force is used both with the purpose of regulating the contact forces as well as obtaining a compliant slave's behavior. However,fccannot be used as feedback force because the operator could not perceive the interaction. Therefore, in order to obtain the feedback force and for the operator to perceive the contact forces, we consider only the tracking errors, i.e.fe≡0, then(27)fs=KPx˜+KDx˜˙.Becausex˜≠0andx˜˙≠0when the contact occurs, the operator can perceive the interaction. Also, this force is encoded using wave variables and on the master's side the forcefmis generated in order to provide the remote information needed to improve the task performance.The stability of the bilateral teleoperator is guaranteed since:1.The human operator (therapist) and the user (patient) can be modeled as passive systems.The forces generated by the operator and the user are assumed bounded.The communication channel is passive according to the wave transformation.The human–robot interaction is stable by using the impedance controller (16).Both robots, master and slave, are controlled by the adaptive scheme (16) and the passivity in both cases is guaranteed if(28)V˙(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)≤−αV(ξ˜,ξ˜˙,θ˜d)for any α>0 [43]. Then,(29)−ξ˜TKPξ˜−ξ˜˙T(KD−Md)ξ˜˙≤−α2ɛTXɛ+θ˜dTΓd−1θ˜d+ξ˜TKPξ˜and after some algebraic procedures(30)(1−α)ξ˜TKPξ˜−α2θ˜dTΓd−1θ˜d+ɛT−α2KD−α2Md−α2MdKD−1+α2Mdɛ≥0From the first two terms of (30) it is obtained that(31)(1−α)ξ˜TKPξ˜≥α2θ˜dTΓd−1θ˜d1−αα≥θ˜dTΓd−1θ˜d2ξ˜TKPξ˜>0⇒α≥1and from the remaining term(32)α2−KDKD+1+α2KDMd−α2MdMd≥0α2Md−KD≥0αKD−1Md≥2Iα≥2ρ(KD−1Md)>0whereρ(KD−1Md)is the spectral radius ofKD−1Md, which has a positive value lower than one considering the condition (19). Therefore, the passivity of the robots controlled by impedance is guaranteed.The master and slave robots, both passive systems controlled by impedance, interact with each other through the communication channel. In bilateral teleoperation, the input power Pinis given by(33)Pin=x˙Tfwherex˙represents the input vector andfis the output vector of the communication system. In order to verify passivity, the overall power input Pinentering the communications(34)Pin=x˙mTfm−x˙sTfsis considered. Substituting the wave transformation equations, the power input is computed as:(35)Pin=12umTum−12vmTvm−12usTus+12vsTvs.In order to compute the stored energy, Eq. (35) is integrated assuming zero initial conditions(36)Estore(t)=12∫t−TrtumTumdτ+∫t−TltvsTvsdτ≥0.This means that the communications in wave domain is not only passive, but also lossless for any time delays Trand Tl. In essence the communication channel becomes, temporarily, an energy-storage element.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, an improved approach to bilateral teleoperation for interaction tasks was presented, which uses an adaptive impedance controller to regulate and enhance the interaction between the robot manipulators and humans (therapists and stroke survivors). Additionally, wave transformation is included into the scheme in order to avoid the instability caused by inherent time delays to the communication channel.The performance of the proposed bilateral teleoperator was tested on two types of motor therapy tasks in passive and active-constrained modalities. The obtained results enabled us to demonstrate the ability of the proposed scheme to improve the system performance on interaction tasks, as compared to the previous proposed schemes.
