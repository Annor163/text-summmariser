BackgroundElectronic medical records (EMR) provide an ideal opportunity for the detection, diagnosis, and management of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The objective of this project was to use informatics to identify potential SSc patients in the VHA that were on prednisone, in order to inform an outreach project to prevent scleroderma renal crisis (SRC).MethodsThe electronic medical data for this study came from Veterans Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI). For natural language processing (NLP) analysis, a set of retrieval criteria was developed for documents expected to have a high correlation to SSc. The two annotators reviewed the ratings to assemble a single adjudicated set of ratings, from which a support vector machine (SVM) based document classifier was trained. Any patient having at least one document positively classified for SSc was considered positive for SSc and the use of prednisone≥10mg in the clinical document was reviewed to determine whether it was an active medication on the prescription list.ResultsIn the VHA, there were 4272 patients that have a diagnosis of SSc determined by the presence of an ICD-9 code. From these patients, 1118 patients (21%) had the use of prednisone≥10mg. Of these patients, 26 had a concurrent diagnosis of hypertension, thus these patients should not be on prednisone. By the use of natural language processing (NLP) an additional 16,522 patients were identified as possible SSc, highlighting that cases of SSc in the VHA may exist that are unidentified by ICD-9. A 10-fold cross validation of the classifier resulted in a precision (positive predictive value) of 0.814, recall (sensitivity) of 0.973, and f-measure of 0.873.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that current clinical practice in the VHA includes the potentially dangerous use of prednisone for veterans with SSc. This present study also suggests there may be many undetected cases of SSc and NLP can successfully identify these patients.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a rare, complex autoimmune disease in which a poor prognosis is most closely related to organ fibrosis and/or hypertensive crisis. Hypertension is the key factor in the development of sudden kidney failure in SSc, which is called scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) [1]. SRC is characterized by malignant hypertension and oliguric/anuric acute renal failure, and occurs in 2% to 5% of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) [2]. If SRC occurs there is a 5-year survival rate of 65%, thus this condition is important to identify and prevent in SSc patients.Several retrospective studies have found that a significant, but perhaps not widely recognized risk factor for SRC is recent use of prednisone [2,3]. The use of prednisone for any indication in SSc remains controversial, but should only be used at the lowest possible dose (ideally<10mg) and reserved for myositis, arthritis, interstitial lung disease, and inflammatory skin disease [4]. SSc patients should be educated to monitor their blood pressure and to take the new onset of hypertension seriously [5]. It is critical to detect SRC in its earliest stages because prompt treatment with the BP-lowering class of drugs called angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) can help to prevent progression to serious kidney failure [6].Unfortunately, over half of cases of SRC have a delay in diagnosis, require dialysis and long-term mortality remains significant [7]. Use of prednisone in a SSc patient and/or a delay in diagnosis of SRC unfortunately can result in high morbidity and mortality due to unnecessary delays in the referral process [8].Electronic medical records (EMR) provide an ideal opportunity for the detection, diagnosis, and management of SSc patients within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The VHA has one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the United States with 8.6 million total enrollees in 2012. The VA Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) office funded the Veterans Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), which began operations in June 2008. VINCI is collaboration between the Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) and the Office of Research and Development (OR&D). VINCI was created to serve the data and Information Technology (IT) needs of the VA research community. The VINCI database is an excellent example of big data, a massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is so large that it׳s difficult to process using traditional database and software techniques. At the time of this study, VINCI provides access to structured and unstructured electronic medical data on 17,543,172 unique patients. VINCI and Consortium for Healthcare Informatics Research (CHIR) have shown that the EMR can be effectively utilized in a de-identified manner for patient safety and quality measurement [9].The objective of this project was to use informatics to identify SSc patients in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) that were prescribed prednisone in order to inform an outreach project to prevent SRC. The investigators had two goals with this informatics project: (1) to identify current SSc patients that may be inappropriate therapy, and (2) to identify if there are potential SSc patients that are not identified by ICD-9 code in order to better understand the potential impact of an outreach project.
