@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
It is an integrated production inventory model of a manufacturer and multiple markets which have different selling seasons.Raw-materials supplier offers a credit period to the manufacturer which may be crisp and fuzzy.The fuzziness of the credit period is analyzed in two different ways such as – triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.Raw-materials for production and finished item are both considered as deteriorating and nondeteriorating cases.Manufacturer allows a conditional part-payment to the markets and his selling price is assumed as an increasing function of production run time.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The presence of multiple markets create profitable opportunities to the supply chain system. In this regard, this paper consists of the joint relationship between a manufacturer and multiple markets in which manufacturer offers part-payment to the markets due to their collection of finished products during the production run time. Here it is also considered that manufacturer is facilitated with credit period by raw material supplier where credit period has been presented as an interactive fuzzy fashion. In this paper, two types of deterioration have been assumed such as one for finished products and the other for raw materials. A solution algorithm is presented to get fuzzy optimal profit for the proposed integrated production inventory system optimizing production run time. A numerical example is used to illustrate the proposed model. Finally, sensitivity analysis has been carried out with respect to the major parameters to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In real business world, sometimes a manufacturer, supplier and markets/retailer would like to make a long-term cooperative relationship as an integrated system to get a tensionless stable sources of supply and demand of items as well as reliability to gain optimum profit from each other. Globally, the industrial environment gradually becomes more and more competitive and much effort has been made towards the efficiency and effectiveness. So in this connection, the supply chain management plays an important role in the present situation. Pan and Yang [24] worked on integrated inventory system with controllable lead time. Chang et al. [2] addressed the optimal pricing and ordering policy for an integrated inventory model when trade credit is linked to order quantity. Then Chen and Kang [3] developed their integrated inventory model with permissible delay in payments. Ho et al. [13] enriched their integrated inventory model with price-and-credit-linked demand under two-level trade credit. There are many research works on integrated technique such as Goyal [10], Jaber and Osman [15], Huang [14] and Taleizadeh et al. [30].In the inventory literature, there are many research works without consideration of production process. But sometimes, consideration of production process becomes necessary to describe a manufacturer's or supply chain model. Yang and Wee [36] developed an integrated production inventory model for deteriorating items. Law and Wee [18] enriched an integrated production-inventory model for ameliorating and deteriorating items taking account of time discounting. Ouyang et al. [22] took an optimal strategy for an integrated system with variable production rate and trade credit financing. Then Das et al. [8] improves a production policy for a deteriorating item under permissible delay in payments with stock-dependent demand rate. Soni and Patel [25] developed an integrated inventory system with variable production under partial trade credit. In an EPQ model, an optimal lot-sizing policy with production cost effects has been described by Teng et al. [33].A manufacturer produces an item and it is sold at different markets. Again sometimes, it is seen that the markets have different selling seasons. So, manufacturer/supplier should have to adopt appropriate management policies/strategies in the business with the different markets. In a production inventory model with deteriorating items, He et al. [12] also considered multiple-market demands. Krichen et al. [17] described a single supplier and multiple cooperative retailers inventory model under permissible delay in payments. Then Pal et al. [23] researched on multi-echelon supply chain model in multiple markets with supply disruption.In the business world, it is seen that a manufacturer produces the items which deteriorates as the time goes on. For example, some of the deteriorating items are - volatile liquids, medicine, fruit juice, cold-drinks etc. Ghare and Schrader [9] first derived an economic order quantity (EOQ) model by assuming exponential decay with constant demand. Next, Covert and Philip [6] extended Ghare and Schrader's constant deterioration rate to a two-parameter Weibull distribution. An EOQ model of deteriorating items was developed by Chu et al. [4]. Mishra and Mishra [21] worked on fuzzified deterioration under cobweb phenomenon and permissible delay in payments. After that, Taleizadeh et al. [28] enriched their inventory model for a deteriorating item with back-ordering and temporary price discount. A lot size model for deteriorating item with expiration dates under two-level trade credit financing was produced by Wu et al. [34].Now-a-days in most of business, offering of a credit period to settle the account takes an important role. In the literature reviews, it is seen that raw materials supplier offers to manufacturer, manufacturer offers to wholesaler, wholesaler offers to retailers, manufacturer offers to markets a delay period which is crisp in nature to settle the account to entice the other. Goyal [11] derived a single item inventory model under the conditions of permissible delay in payments. Abad et al. [1] developed a seller–buyer model under permissible delay in payments by game theory to determine the optimal unit price with trade credit period, considering that the demand rate is a function of the retail price. Teng et al. [32] developed the optimal pricing and lot-sizing model under permissible delay in payments by considering the difference between selling price and purchase cost when demand rate is a function of the selling price. In supply chain system, Chung et al. [5] developed a simplified algorithm with two part trade credit. Liang and Zhou [19] described a two-warehouse inventory model for deteriorating items under conditionally permissible delay in payment. An EPQ-based inventory model for exponentially deteriorating items under retailer partial trade credit policy in supply chain was described by Mahata [20]. Su [26] worked on integrated inventory system with defective items allowing shortages under trade credit. Then Das et al. [7] woked on integrated supply chain model for a deteriorating item with procurement cost dependent credit period.Real business world is full of uncertainties in non-stochastic sense, which leads to estimation of different inventory parameters as fuzzy numbers. Introduction to fuzzy set theory and basic ideas of fuzziness are described by Zimmermann [37]. Ko et al. [16] made a review on soft computing application in supply chain management system. Yan et al. [35] developed their integrated production distribution model with deteriorating item. Taleizadeh et al. [29] described a joint-replenishment inventory control problem using uncertain programming. For solving a fuzzy single-period problem, Taleizadeh et al. [27] developed meta-heuristic algorithms. Then Taleizadeh et al. [31] worked on fuzzy rough EOQ model considering quantity discount and repayment. From Table 1, it is seen that till now no researcher has worked on the integrated EPQ model for deteriorating item with fuzzy credit period in multiple sessional markets.In this paper, a manufacturer receives the deteriorating raw materials from a supplier who offers a credit period (which is fuzzy in nature) to settle his/her account. We have also considered the fuzziness of the credit period in different ways. The manufacturer produces the item which deteriorates over time and supplies to the markets which have different selling seasons. The markets receive the required item as a lot at the beginning of its business. Those markets start their businesses before the production ends, they get an opportunity of part payment at the beginning and the remaining amount should be paid at the end of their own business. Here, the manufacturer and the markets maximize their profits as an integrated form to get rid of tension in the business.The organization in this paper is in the following way: Section 2 describes the formulation of the production inventory model with deteriorating item. In Section 3, formulations for non-deteriorating item are derived. Model with fuzzy credit period are developed in Section 4 and in Section 5 numerical examples, sensitivity analysis and some managerial insights have been performed. Finally in Section 6, a conclusion is made.In this paper, it has been considered that a manufacturer produces a single item using raw materials which are purchased from a raw material supplier and the finished products are sold to different markets which have different constant customers’ demands and different sessions of the business. Here, the raw material supplier offers a credit period to the manufacturer, which may be fuzzy in nature. Every market collects all its required quantity of item as per its demand at the starting time of its business period. Here manufacturer also gives an opportunity of initial part-payment to those markets who receive the items during the production run time and the remaining amount will be paid to the manufacturer after the completion of their business, otherwise full payment will be made at the initial time of their business. The manufacturer earns interest by the collected sales revenue from the markets.To illustrate the proposed model, the following notations have been used.(i)C1: manufacturer's ordering cost per order.C2: manufacturer's setup cost.C3: all markets’ set-up cost.hr: raw material's holding cost rate.hp: finished product's holding cost rate.f: unit usage of raw materials per finished product.p: manufacturer's production rate.di: customers’ demand rate for i-th market.Qi: quantity received by i-th market from the manufacturer.Ti: starting time of the business of i-th market.θr: constant deterioration rate of raw materials.θ: constant deterioration rate of finished products.T: time where production is stopped.M: credit period offered by the raw material supplier to the manufacturer.Tie: time at which the selling season ends for i-th market.cr: manufacturer's raw material's purchase cost per unit.cp: unit purchase cost by markets.s: unit selling price of markets.n: number of markets where the item is sold.Id: rate of interest earned per year.Ic: rate of interest payable per year.MTP: total markets profitWTP: total manufacturer's profitITP: total profit for the integrated systemfor deteriorating item.MTP2: total markets profitWTP2: total manufacturer's profitITP2: total profit for the integrated systemfor non-deteriorating item.The following assumptions have been used to generate this model.1.A single manufacturer and multiple markets have been assumed for a flow of single product.Production rate (p) and production run time (T) both are deterministic variables.Time horizon is finite.Shortages are not allowed.Deterioration rates of raw materials (θr) and finished products (θ) are deterministic and constant.In practical business world, sometimes it is seen that the credit period offered by the supplier has a little disturbance i.e., it changes due to various factors according to his/her business policy. So in nature, it is vague and imprecise. For this reason here, it has been considered that raw material supplier offers a fuzzy credit period to the manufacturer. Now in fuzzy set theory [37], there are some standard fuzzy numbers such as triangular, trapezoidal, Gaussian etc among which the triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers have been considered for illustration.Since the maintenance cost for production is increased with the increase of production run time, hence in this paper it has been considered that the manufacturer's selling price (cp) of a finished product to the markets to be an increasing function of production run time (T) which is defined by cp=aeαT, where a>0 and α≥0.The manufacturer offers an opportunity of initial part-payment to those markets who receive the item before the end of production run and the remaining part should be paid at the end of their individual business session. But the markets who receive their required item after the production run time (T), do’nt get this opportunity. Every market receives all items at the starting time of their business period to fulfil their fixed customers’ demand.The manufacturer receives all of the required quantity of raw materials instantaneously from the raw material supplier for a production run when he/she is going to start his/her production (Fig. 1). Then as the time goes on, the inventory of raw materials depletes gradually due to production and deterioration and vanishes at time T. The raw material's inventory Ir(t) at time t is given by the differential equation(1)dIr(t)dt+θrIr(t)=−fpwhen0≤t≤Twith the boundary condition(2)Ir(T)=0Using the boundary condition (2), the solution of the Eq. (1) is obtained as(3)Ir(t)=fpθr[eθr(T−t)−1]The quantity of raw materials received by the manufacturer is(4)Qr=Ir(0)=fpθr[eθrT−1]Raw material's holding cost ishr.∫0TIr(t)dt=hr.fpθr∫0T{eθr(T−t)−1}dt=fphrθr2[eθrT−θrT−1]The manufacturer pays the full payment to the raw material supplier at the end of the credit period M. For this purpose, the manufacturer takes a loan to cover the payment due to the remaining quantity in the period M to T at the rate of interest Ic. So, interest payable by the manufacturer iscrIc.∫MTIr(t)dt=crIc.∫MTfpθr[eθr(T−t)−1]dt=crfpIcθr2[eθr(T−M)−1−θr(T−M)]Manufacturer's sales revenue=cp.∑i=1nQiManufacturer's raw material's purchase cost=cr.Qr=cr.fpθr(eθrT−1)The manufacturer starts production of the deteriorating item at time t=0 and then the inventory level increases over time. After time T1, the first market receives all of his required quantity Q1 instantaneously, then at time T2 the second market receives his required quantity Q2 instantaneously and so on. At time T, the production is stopped, then inventory level decreases due to deterioration of the item and the remaining markets’ instantaneous quantity replenishment and the inventory is vanished for receiving the quantity Qnby the last market. Let the manufacturer's inventory level in the interval [Ti−1, Ti] (i=1, 2, ..., n) be Ii(t) and Im−(t), Im+(t) be the inventory levels in time intervals [Tm−1, T], [T, Tm] respectively. Then the differential equations of the finished products' inventory levels at time t in [0,Tn] are as follows (Fig. 2):(5)dI1(t)dt+θI1(t)=p,0≤t≤T1with boundary condition I1(0)=0(6)dIk(t)dt+θIk(t)=p,Tk−1≤t≤Tk[k=2,3,...,(m−1)]with boundary conditions Ik(Tk−1)=Ik−1(Tk−1)−Qk−1(7)dIm−(t)dt+θIm−(t)=p,Tm−1≤t≤Twith boundary condition Im−(Tm−1)=Im−1(Tm−1)−Qm−1(8)dIm+(t)dt+θIm+(t)=0,T≤t≤TmdIj(t)dt+θIj(t)=0,Tj−1≤t≤Tj(j=m+1,m+2,…,n)with boundary conditions Im+(Tm) = Jm+1(Tm) + Qm, Ij(Tj−1)=Ij−1(Tj−1)−Qj−1 (j=m+1, m+2, ..., n) and In(Tn)=QnSolving these equations we get,(9)Ik(t)=pθ(1−e−θt)−∑i=0k−1Qieθ(Ti−t);whereTk−1≤t≤Tk(1≤k≤m−1)(10)Ij(t)=∑i=jNQieθ(Ti−t);whereTj−1≤t≤Tj(j=m+1,m+2,...,n)(11)Im−(t)=pθ(1−e−θt)−∑i=1m−1Qieθ(Ti−t);(12)Im+(t)=∑i=mnQieθ(Ti−t);(13)Nowat,t=T,Im−(t)=Im+(t)which givesT=1θlog{1+θp∑i=1nQieθTi}which is the relation between the two variables T and p.Manufacturer's finished products holding cost HP is given byHP=hp[∑k=1m−1Ik+Im−+Im++∑j=m+1nIj]where,Ik=∫Tk−1TkIk(t)dt=pθ{(Tk−Tk−1)+1θ(e−θTk−e−θTk−1)}+1θ(e−Tk−e−Tk−1).∑i=0k−1QieθTiIj=∫Tj−1TjIj(t)dt=−1θ(e−θTj−e−θTj−1).∑i=jNQieθTiIm−=∫Tm−1TIm−(t)dt=pθ{(T−Tm−1)+1θ(e−θT−e−θTm−1)}+1θ(e−θT−e−Tm−1).∑i=1m−1QieθTiIm+=∫TTmIj(t)dt=−1θ(e−θT−e−θTm).∑i=mnQieθTiTherefore,HP=hp[pTθ+pθ2(e−θT−1)+1θ∑k=2m−1(e−θTk−e−θTk−1).∑i=1k−1QieθTi+1θ(e−θT−e−θTm−1).∑i=1m−1QieθTi+1θ(e−θT−e−θTm).∑i=mnQieθTi−1θ∑j=mn(e−θT−e−θTm).∑i=jnQieθTi]Manufacturer's interest earned is∑Ti≤T,i=1nIdQicpr(Tn−Ti)+∑Ti≤T,i=1nQicp(1−r)Id(Tn−Tie)+∑Ti>T,i=1nQicpId(Tn−Ti)The manufacturer's profit function:The manufacturer's total profit WTP is given byWTP(p, T)= sales revenue − raw material's purchase cost − raw material's holding cost − finished products holding cost − interest payable + interest earned − ordering cost − set-up cost(14)=cp.∑i=1nQi−cr.fpθr(eθrT−1)−fphrθr2[eθrT−θrT−1]−crfpIcθr2[eθr(T−M)−1−θr(T−M)]−hp[pTθ+pθ2(e−θT−e−θT1)+1θ∑k=2m−1(e−θTk−e−θTk−1).∑i=1k−1QieθTi+1θ(e−θT−e−θTm−1).∑i=1m−1QieθTi+1θ(e−θT−e−θTm).∑i=mnQieθTi−1θ∑j=mn(e−θT−e−θTm).∑i=jnQieθTi]+∑Ti≤T,i=1nIdQicpr(Tn−Ti)+∑Ti≤T,i=1nQicp(1−r)Id(Tn−Tie)+∑Ti>T,i=1nQicpId(Tn−Ti)−C1−C2The i-th market receives his/her total required quantity of deteriorative item from the manufacturer at the beginning of its selling season to fulfil the customers’ demand rate di. Those markets start their business on or before the production run time T, pay r portion of the price amount payable initially and the remaining (1−r) portion pay at the end of his/her business period. But those markets arrive after the production run time T, pay the total amount at their business starting time. They pay the initial amount by getting loan from a bank at the rate of interest of Icper year. Every market earns interest at the rate of Idby depositing sales revenue continuously. The inventory level Ji(t) for the i-th market is governed by the following differential equation (Fig. 3):(15)dJi(t)dt=−θ.Ji(t)−di(i=1,2,....,n)with boundary condition J(Tie)=0Solving we get,(16)Ji(t)=diθ[eθ(Tie−t)−1]The ith market receives the quantity(17)Qi=Ji(0)=diθ[eθTie−1]Holding cost (MHC) for all markets is given byMHC=∑i=1nhm∫TiTieJi(t)dt=∑i=1nhmdiθ2[eθ(Tie−Ti)−θ(Tie−Ti)−1]All markets’ total sales revenue (MPS) is given byMPS=∑i=1nsdi(Tie−Ti)All markets’ total purchase cost (MPC) is given byMPC=∑i=1ncp.QiAll markets’ total interest earned (MIE) is obtained asMIE=∑i=1ncpdiId∫TiTie(Tie−t)dt=∑i=1nsdiId.12(Tie−Ti)2All markets’ total interest payable (MIP) is expressed asMIP=∑i=1,Ti≤TnQirsId(Tie−Ti)+∑i=1,Ti≥TnQicpIc(Tie−Ti)Therefore, all markets’ total profit (MTP) is given byMTP(p,T) = MPS − MPC − MHC − MIP + MIE − set-up cost(18)=∑i=1nsdi(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1ncpQi−∑i=1nhmdiθ2[eθ(Tie−Ti)−θ(Tie−Ti)−1]−C3−∑i=1,Ti≤TnrQicpIc(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1,Ti≥TnQicpIc(Tie−Ti)+∑i=1nsdiId.12(Tie−Ti)2So, the total profit (ITP) for the integrated system is written as(19)ITP(p,T)=WTP(p,T)+MTP(p,T)=−cr.fpθr(eθrT−1)−fphrθr2[eθrT−θrT−1]−crfpIcθr2[eθr(T−M)−1−θr(T−M)]−hp[pTθ+pθ2(e−θT−e−θT1)+1θ∑k=2m−1(e−θTk−e−θTk−1).∑i=1k−1QieθTi+1θ(e−θT−e−θTm−1).∑i=1m−1QieθTi+1θ(e−θT−e−θTm).∑i=mnQieθTi−1θ∑j=mn(e−θT−e−θTm).∑i=jnQieθTi]+∑Ti≤T,i=1nIdQicpr(Tn−Ti)+∑Ti≤T,i=1nQicp(1−r)Id(Tn−Tie)+∑Ti>T,i=1nQicpId(Tn−Ti)−C1−C2−C3+∑i=1nsdi(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1nhmdiθ2[eθ(Tie−Ti)−θ(Tie−Ti)−1]−∑i=1,Ti≤TnQircpIc(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1,Ti≥TnQicpIc(Tie−Ti)+∑i=1nsdiId.12(Tie−Ti)2Now, our objective is to find out optimal values of T, p and ITP such that the integrated total profit function ITP(p, T) be maximum.Lemma 1: Manufacturer's production rate (p) must satisfy the conditionp≥Max[θ∑i=1kQieθ(Ti−Tk)1−e−θTk]whenTk≤TProof:(20)Ik(t)=pθ1−e−θTk−∑i=1nQi⋅eθ(Ti−Tk)Now,whenTk≤T,Ik(Tk)≥Qki.e,pθ1−e−θTk−∑i=1nQi⋅eθ(Ti−Tk)≥Qki.e,p≥θ∑i=1kQi⋅eθ(Ti−Tk)1−e−θTkThere are also some raw materials and items which deteriorate after a long time beyond of company's consideration or do’nt deteriorate over time. So in this section, we consider the model for the case of non-deteriorating item i.e, when θ=0 and θr=0 (Fig. 4).To formulate the model in this case, the calculations are as follows:Total produced quantity ispT=∑i=1nQii.e,T=1p∑i=1nQiRaw material's holding cost isfphr.T22Interest payable by manufacturer isfpcrIc.(T−M)22Quantity of raw material's received by manufacturer isQr=fpTManufacturer's purchase cost iscrQr=fpcr.TManufacturer's finished products holding cost (HP) is given byHP=pT22−∑k=2m−1(Tk−Tk−1).∑i=1k−1Qi−(T−Tm−1).∑i=1m−1Qi−(T−Tm).∑i=mnQi+∑j=m+1n(Tj−Tj−1).∑i=jnQiHolding cost for all of the markets is∑i=1nhmdi2.(Tie−Ti)2The i-th market's received quantity Qiis given byQi=di(Tie−Ti)Therefore, the manufacturer's total profit (WTP2) is given by(21)WTP2(p,T)=Cp∑i=1nQi−crpT−fpcrIc.(T−M)22−fphr.T22−hp[pT22−∑k=2m−1(Tk−Tk−1).∑i=1k−1Qi−(T−Tm−1)∑i=1m−1Qi−(T−Tm)∑i=mnQi+∑j=m+1n(Tj−Tj−1)∑i=jnQi]+∑Ti≤T,i=1nIdQicpr(Tn−Ti)+∑Ti≤T,i=1nQicp(1−r)Id(Tn−Tie)+∑Ti>T,i=1nQicpId(Tn−Ti)−C1−C2All markets’ total profit (MTP2) is obtained as (Fig. 5)(22)MTP2(p,T)=∑i=1nsdi(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1ncpQi−∑i=1nhmdi2.(Tie−Ti)2−∑i=1,Ti≤TnQircpIc(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1,Ti≥TnQicpIc(Tie−Ti)+∑i=1nsdiId.12(Tie−Ti)2−C3Therefore, the total profit (ITP2(p, T)) for the integrated system is given by(23)ITP2(p,T)=WTP2(p,T)+MTP2(p,T)=Cp∑i=1nQi−crpT−fpcrIc.(T−M)22−fphr.T22−hp[pT22−∑k=2m−1(Tk−Tk−1).∑i=1k−1Qi−(T−Tm−1)∑i=1m−1Qi−(T−Tm)∑i=mnQi+∑j=m+1n(Tj−Tj−1)∑i=jnQi]+∑Ti≤T,i=1nIdQicpr(Tn−Ti)+∑Ti≤T,i=1nQicp(1−r)Id(Tn−Tie)+∑Ti>T,i=1nQicpId(Tn−Ti)−C1−C2−C3+∑i=1nsdi(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1ncpQi−∑i=1nhmdi2.(Tie−Ti)2−∑i=1,Ti≤TnQircpIc(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1,Ti≥TnQicpIc(Tie−Ti)+∑i=1nsdiId.12(Tie−Ti)2Then maximizing ITP2(p, T), the optimum values of the required variables and objective function will be obtained for this case.DEFINITION 1 [Fuzzy set]: If X is a collection of objects denoted generically by x, then a fuzzy setA˜in X is a set of ordered pairs:A˜={(x,μA˜(x))|x∈X}μA˜(x)is called the membership function or grade of membership of x inA˜which maps X to the membership space M. (When M contains only the two points 0 and 1,A˜is called non-fuzzy andμA˜(x)is identical to the characteristic function of a non-fuzzy set.) The range of the membership function is a subset of the non-negative real numbers whose supremum is finite.Example:A˜=“real numbers considerably larger than 8”A˜={(x,μA˜(x))|x∈X}whereμA˜(x)=0;whenx≤8(1+(x−8)−2)−1;whenx>8DEFINITION 2 [Fuzzy Function]: Let X and Y be the universes andP˜(Y)be the set of all fuzzy sets in Y (power set),f˜: X →P˜(Y)is a mapping. Thenf˜is a fuzzy function iffμf˜(x)(y)=μR˜(x,y), ∀(x,y)∈ X× YwhereμR˜(x,y)is the membership function of the fuzzy relation.Example: Let X be the set of all workers of a plant,f˜the daily output and y the number of processed work pieces. A fuzzy function could then bef˜(x)=y.DEFINITION 3 [Fuzzy extension principle]: Let X be a cartesian product of universes X=X1, X2, ....., XrandA1˜,A2˜,.....Ar˜be fuzzy sets in X1, X2, ....., Xrrespectively. Assume that f is a mapping from X to a universe Y, y=f(x1, x2, ..., xr). Then the extension principle allows us to define a fuzzy setB˜in Y byB˜=(y,μB˜(y)):y=f(x1,x2,....,xr),(x1,....,xr)∈X,whereμB˜(y)=x∈f−1(y)supμA˜(x)iff−1(y)≠∅0otherwiseExample: LetA˜={(−1,0.5),(0,0.8),(1,1),(2,0.4)}and f(x)=x2. Then by applying the extension principle, we get thatB˜=f(A˜)={(0,0.8),(1,1),(4,0.4)}DEFINITION 4 [Fuzzy number]: A fuzzy numberM˜is a convex normalized fuzzy setM˜of the real lineRsuch that(i) It exists exactly onex0∈RwithμM˜(x0)=1(x0 is called the mean value ofM˜).(ii)μM˜(x)is piece wise continuous.Example: The following fuzzy set is fuzzy number:approximately 5={(3, .2), (4, .6), (5, 1), (6, .7), (7, .1)}But {(3, .8), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, .7)} is not a fuzzy number because μ(4) and μ(5) =1.According to assumption-6 in section §2.1.2, in this paper it is considered that the raw material supplier gives an opportunity to the manufacturer by offering a fuzzy credit period(M˜). Here, the credit periodM˜is represented in two different forms such as triangular fuzzy number and trapezoidal fuzzy number. So due to fuzzy credit period(M˜), the optimum value of integrated profit function ITP(p, T) in Eq. (19) will be different for various values of M with some degree of belongingness. Therefore in such situation, the profit function will be fuzzy in nature and is denoted byITP(p,T)(M˜), where(24)ITP(p,T)(M˜)=−cr.fpθr(eθrT−1)−fphrθr2[eθrT−θrT−1]−crfpIcθr2[eθr(T−M˜)−1−θr(T−M˜)]−hp[pTθ+pθ2(e−θT−e−θT1)+1θ∑k=2m−1(e−θTk−e−θTk−1).∑i=1k−1QieθTi+1θ(e−θT−e−θTm−1).∑i=1m−1QieθTi+1θ(e−θT−e−θTm).∑i=mnQieθTi−1θ∑j=mn(e−θT−e−θTm).∑i=jnQieθTi]+∑Ti≤T,i=1nIdQicpr(Tn−Ti)+∑Ti≤T,i=1nQicp(1−r)Id(Tn−Tie)+∑Ti>T,i=1nQicpId(Tn−Ti)−C1−C2−C3+∑i=1nsdi(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1nhmdiθ2[eθ(Tie−Ti)−θ(Tie−Ti)−1]−∑i=1,Ti≤TnQircpIc(Tie−Ti)−∑i=1,Ti≥TnQicpIc(Tie−Ti)+∑i=1nsdiId.12(Tie−Ti)2Let us consider the credit periodM˜as the triangular fuzzy number such asM˜= (M0−Δ1, M0, M0+Δ2), where 0<Δ1<M0 and 0<Δ2; Δ1, Δ2 are determined by the decision makers.

Here, the manufacturer's raw-materials holding cost rate is $4 and the supplier offers a crisp credit period to the manufacturer to settle the account. Then using 1.2 units of raw-materials, the manufacturer produces a finished item which also deteriorates at the rate of 0.15. The company sells the finished item to three different markets which have different selling seasons such as [0.09, 0.20], [0.20, 0.32] and [0.40, 0.60] in year with their annual demand rates being 15,000, 14,000 and 16,000 units respectively. The company's purchase cost of raw-materials is $8 per unit and selling price parameters are a=14, α=0.3 [according to assumption 7]. The holding cost rates for company's raw-materials and finished products are $4 and $5 respectively. Also here, the ordering cost and set-up cost of the manufacturer as well as all markets’ set-up cost are $2000, $3000 and $2000 respectively. The rates of selling price and holding cost for each market are $20 and $7 respectively. The manufacturer earns the interest at the rate of $0.08 on deposited revenue. At the same time, the company also pays an amount to the supplier at the rate of $0.12. Now, the company is interested to find out a table showing the optimal profits individually and jointly with the markets along with optimal production rate, optimal production run time and the manufacturer's selling price for different values of α and M.Solution: Since the objective functions of the proposed models are highly non-linear, hence these can not be optimized analytically. So, the standard LINGO software has been used to get the optimal solution of such type of models utilizing the above parameters. It is a powerful general non-linear solver which includes a number of ways to find optimal solution for non-linear model. It is based upon a Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) algorithm. However to get a good feasible solution quickly, it also incorporates successive linear programming. This non-linear solver takes advantage of sparsity for improve speeds and more efficient memory usage. The obtained results have been shown in Table 2.Example 2: The problem in Example 1 for non-deteriorating item when α=0.3.Solution: The results obtained by LINGO is shown in Table 3.Example 3: The problem in Example 1 when supplier's offered trade credit period is a triangular fuzzy number with M0=0.16 and the raw-materials and finished item are both deteriorating for α=0.3.Solution: The solutions are followed by the steps below.Step 1: for Δ1=0.10 and Δ2=0.20 get M*=0.1333 from Eq. (25).Step 2: in Eq. (19), putting M=M0−Δ1=0.06, M=M0=0.16 and M=M0+Δ2=0.18, find y1(p, T), y2(p, T) and y3(p, T) respectively.Step 3: find the expressionCI(p,T)=13[y1(p,T)+y2(p,T)+y3(p,T)]Step 4: maximizing CI(p, T) using LINGO get T=0.18, p=37714 and for these values of T and p get ITP=45175, MTP=26495 and WTP=18680.Step 5: repeat all the previous steps to find the results for other values of Δ1 and Δ2.The obtained results are shown in Table 4.Example 4: The problem is same as in Example 1 for deteriorating item when the supplier's offered credit period is a trapezoidal fuzzy number.Solution: The obtained results are shown in Table 5.Example 5: The same problem in Example 1 when supplier's offered trade credit period is a triangular fuzzy number with M0=0.16 and the raw-materials and finished item are both non-deteriorating for α=0.3.Solution: The obtained results are shown in Table 6.Example 6: The problem is same as Example 1 when supplier's offered trade credit period is a trapezoidal fuzzy number with M0=0.16 and the raw-materials and finished item are both non-deteriorating for α=0.3.Solution: The obtained results are shown in Table 7.Effects on the fuzzy model with deteriorating item for change of the values of the parameters di, θ and θrhave been shown in Table 8.Now from Table 8, it is observed that p, MTP, WTP and CI increase with the increase of di. When θ increases, the values of MTP and CI decrease but WTP at first decreases and then increases. In this case the pattern of p can not be predicted. Again when θrincreases, WTP and CI decrease but MTP and p increase.In the fuzzy integrated model, two optimum production run times have been obtained using TFN and TPFN. Now question is that does there exist any significance difference between these two values ? If exists, then how much? To get this answer, it can be tested that the null hypothesis H0:T¯TFN(mean of values of T for TFN) =T¯TPFN(mean of values of T for TPFN) against the alternative hypothesis H1:T¯TFN≠T¯TPFNon the basis of the results presented in Tables 4 and 5. This hypothesis can be tested using t-distribution.The test statistic ist=T¯TFN−T¯TPFNs.(1/n1)+(1/n2)which follows t-distribution with (n1+n2−2) degrees of freedom, wheres2=n1s2TFN+n2s2TPFNn1+n2−2Here n1=5, n2=5,T¯TFN=0.26068,T¯TPFN=0.2482,sTFN2=0.00428,sTPFN2=0.00278.Therefore, degrees of freedom =8 and value of t=0.7204.Since the calculated value of t < the tabulated value of t0.05, we accept the null hypothesis H0 with 95% confidence limit and conclude that there is no significant difference between the mean production run time (T) for TFN and TPFN.Based on the results obtained in Tables 2–7 and from Fig. 8, the following managerial insights are obtained.(1) From Table 2, it is seen that with the increase of M, the optimal values of T, cp, WTP and ITP increase but p and MTP decrease when α is fixed. Again considering M fixed, the optimal values of T, MTP and ITP decrease but cp, p and WTP increase with the increase of α. It implies that for the crisp model with deteriorating item, if the supplier's offered credit period be longer then production run time, markets’ unit purchase cost, manufacturer's profit and integrated profit will be more but markets’ total profit’ll be lesser. Again for fixed credit period, when the purchase cost parameter α be more, then production run time, markets’ profit and integrated profit is less but markets’ unit purchase cost, production rate and manufacturer's profit is more.(2) From Table 3, it is seen that for the crisp model with non-deteriorating item, the optimal values of all variables and objective functions have same characteristics as the case under deteriorating item.(3) From Fig. 8, it is observed that for a fixed value of credit period (M), the integrated total profit (ITP) initially increases with the increase of production run time (T). Then after getting its maximum value, it decreases. So, the integrated profit is a concave function.(4) Tables 4–7 reveal that as imprecise nature (i.e., difference Δ*) increases, the centroid value (i.e, M*) of fuzzy credit period increases and the rate of change of the centroid value (i.e, CI) of fuzzy integrated profit with respect to total profit (ITP) increases. It is also concluded that, the trade credit period (M*) and the production rate (p) are inversely proportional to each other whereas the production period T is directly proportional to M*.(5) From Table 8, it is concluded that when the markets’ demands increase then production run time, manufacturer's profit and integrated profit increase. More deterioration of finished products implies less markets’ profit but manufacturer's profit fluctuates. Again, more raw-materials’ deterioration implies more markets’ profit and production run time but less manufacturer's profit.(6) From the comparison test between the optimum production run times due to TFN and TPFN in Section 5.1.1, it is inferred that there is no significant difference between optimum production run times due to triangular fuzzy credit period and trapezoidal fuzzy credit period.
