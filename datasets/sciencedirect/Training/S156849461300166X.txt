In this study, a novel approach via the composite of fuzzy controllers and dithers is presented. According to this approach, we can synthesize a set of fuzzy controllers and find appropriate dithers to stabilize nonlinear multiple time-delay (NMTD) interconnected systems. A robustness design of model-based fuzzy control is first proposed to overcome the effect of modeling errors between the NMTD interconnected subsystems and Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy models. In terms of Lyapunov's direct method, a delay-dependent stability criterion is then derived to guarantee the asymptotic stability of NMTD interconnected systems. Based on this criterion and the decentralized control scheme, a set of model-based fuzzy controllers is synthesized via the technique of parallel distributed compensation (PDC) to stabilize the NMTD interconnected system. When the designed fuzzy controllers cannot stabilize the NMTD interconnected systems, a batch of high-frequency signals (commonly referred to as dithers) is simultaneously introduced to stabilize it. If the frequencies of dithers are high enough, the outputs of the dithered interconnected system and those of its corresponding mathematical model–the relaxed interconnected system can be made as close as desired. This makes it possible to obtain a rigorous prediction of the stability of the dithered interconnected system based on the one of the relaxed interconnected system. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility of our approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since high performance requirements of present-day complex industrial processes place increasing demands on stability and stabilization, the orthodox of driving a complex system has become unattractive while the stability problem of interconnected systems has received considerable attention. In the meanwhile, a number of interconnected systems (also called large-scale systems or composite systems) founded in the real world are composed of a set of small interconnected subsystems, such as electric power systems, nuclear reactors, aerospace systems, economic systems, chemical and petroleum industries, and different types of societal systems. In practice, due to the information transmission between subsystems, time delays naturally exist in interconnected systems. The existence of a time delay is frequently the cause of poor performance and instability [1,2]. Consequently, the problem of stability analysis in time-delay systems remains a major topic in this field. Numerous reports on this subject have been published (see [3–5] and the references therein). Moreover, time delays often appear in various engineering systems [6], such as the structure control of tall buildings, hydraulics, or electronic networks, etc. Notably, the introduction of a time-delay factor tends to complicate the analysis. Hence, convenient methods to check stability have long been sought after. The stability criteria of time-delay systems so far have been approached from two main directions according to the dependence on the size of delay. One method is to contrive stability conditions that do not include information on the delay, while the other method takes time delay into account. The former case is often referred to as delay-independent criteria and generally gives good algebraic conditions. However, the abandonment of information on the size of the time delay necessarily causes conservativeness of the criteria, especially when the delay is comparatively small. Hence, delay-dependent criteria are derived to deal with the stability problem in this study.Fuzzy control has attracted a great deal of attention from both the academic and industrial communities over the past decade, and there have been many successful applications. For example, Wang et al. [7] presented a new measurement system that comprises a model-based fuzzy logic controller, an arterial tonometer and a micro syringe device for the noninvasive monitoring of the continuous blood pressure wave form in the radial artery. A good tracking performance control scheme, a hybrid fuzzy neural-network control for nonlinear motor-toggle servomechanism, was given in Wai [8]; Hwang et al. [9] developed the trajectory tracking of a car-like mobile robot using network-based fuzzy decentralized sliding-mode control; a hybrid fuzzy-PI speed controller for permanent magnet synchronous motor was proposed in Sant and Rajagopal [10]; and Spatti et al. [11] introduced a fuzzy control strategy for voltage regulation in electric power distribution systems: this real-time controller would act on power transformers equipped with under-load tap changers.Despite the successes, many basic problems remain to be solved. Stability analysis and systematic design are certainly among the most important issues for fuzzy control systems. Lately, there have been significant research efforts devoted to these issues (see [12–14] and the references therein). Moreover, the existence of modeling errors may be a source of instability for control designs based on the assumption that the fuzzy model exactly matches the nonlinear plant [15]. Kiriakidis [15], Chen et al. [16] and Cao et al. [17,18] recently proposed novel approaches to overcome the influence of modeling errors in the field of model-based fuzzy control for nonlinear systems.If the fuzzy controllers cannot stabilize the nonlinear multiple time-delay (NMTD) interconnected system, a batch of dithers (as the auxiliaries of the fuzzy controllers) is simultaneously introduced to stabilize it instead of redesigning the fuzzy controllers. The application of dither, a high frequency signal, is an effective and convenient alternative among the approaches to stabilize nonlinear systems. It has been long known that the injection of dither into a nonlinear system may improve its performance (see [19–28] and the references therein). Better performance is viewed as less distortion in the system output, augmented stability, and quenching of limit cycles and jump phenomena [23]. A rigorous analysis of stability in a general nonlinear system with a dither control was given in Steinberg and Kadushin [19]. Later, Zames and Shneydor [20,21] considered a specific configuration of a nonlinear system and provided a lower bond for the dither repetition frequency. Subsequently, Mossaheb [22] pointed out that a dither of sufficiently high frequency may result in the output of the relaxed system and that of the dithered system as close as desired. This makes it possible to obtain a rigorous prediction of the stability of the dithered system based on the one of its corresponding relaxed system, provided that the dither has a high enough frequency. Moreover, there have also been some successful applications of dithers in recent years. Feeny and Moon [25] applied dither to quench the chaos inherent in a stick-slip oscillator and showed that the discontinuity for the low-frequency behavior could be effectively removed. Iannelli et al. [27,28] further indicated that the use of dithers could narrow the discontinuous nonlinearities of feedback systems.According to the aforementioned, a novel approach via the composite of fuzzy controllers and dithers is proposed in this study. Based on this approach and the decentralized control scheme, we can synthesize a set of model-based fuzzy controllers through the technique of parallel distributed compensation (PDC) and find appropriate dithers to stabilize the NMTD interconnected system. A robustness design of model-based fuzzy control is first proposed to overcome the effect of modeling errors between the NMTD interconnected subsystems and T–S fuzzy models. In terms of Lyapunov's direct method, a delay-dependent stability criterion is then derived to guarantee the asymptotic stability of NMTD interconnected systems. Subsequently, the stability conditions of this criterion are reformulated into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). On the basis of the LMI, a robustness design of fuzzy control is proposed to stabilize the NMTD interconnected system.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The system description is presented and the T–S fuzzy model and PDC scheme are briefly introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, a robustness design of fuzzy control and a delay-dependent stability criterion are proposed to overcome the effects of modeling errors. In order to stabilize the NMTD interconnected system, a novel approach via the combination of fuzzy controllers and dithers is provided in Section 4. The design algorithm is presented in Section 5. In Section 6, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by a numerical simulation. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 7.Consider a nonlinear multiple time-delay (NMTD) large-scale system N composed of J interconnected subsystems Nj, j=1, 2, ⋯, J. The jth subsystem Njis described as follows:(2.1)x˙j(t)=fj(xj(t),uj(t))+∑k=1Gjgkj(xj(t−τkj))+∑n=1n≠jJbnj(xn(t)),where fj(·) and gkj(·) are the nonlinear vector-valued functions, xj(t) denotes the state vector, τkj(time delay) k=1, 2, ⋯, Gjare positive real numbers, uj(t) is the input vector and bnj(·) is the nonlinear interconnection between the nth and jth subsystems.In the following, a T–S fuzzy model with multiple time delays is first constructed for each interconnected subsystem. In this type of fuzzy model, each fuzzy implication is expressed by a linear system model, which allows us to use linear feedback control as in the case of feedback stabilization.In a little more than two decades ago, a fuzzy dynamical model was developed primarily from the pioneering work of Takagi and Sugeno [29] to represent the local linear input/output relations of nonlinear systems. This dynamical model is described by IF-THEN rules and it will be employed here to handle the control design problem of the NMTD interconnected system N. The ith rule of the T–S fuzzy model for the interconnected subsystem Njis proposed as the following form:Rule i: IF x1j(t) is Mi1jand … andxδjj(t)isMiδjjTHEN(2.2)x˙j(t)=Aijxj(t)+∑k=1GjA¯ikjxj(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆinjxn(t)+Bijuj(t)wherexjT(t)=[x1j(t),x2j(t),⋯,xδjj(t)],ujT(t)=[u1j(t),u2j(t),⋯,umjj(t)], i=1, 2, ⋯, rjand rjis the number of IF-THEN rules; Aij,A¯ikj,Aˆinjand Bijare constant matrices with appropriate dimension; Mipj(p=1, 2, ⋯, δj) are the fuzzy sets, andx1j(t)∼xδjj(t)are the premise variables. The final state of this fuzzy dynamic model is inferred as follows:(2.3)x˙j(t)=∑i=1rjwij(t)Aijxj(t)+∑k=1GjA¯ikjxj(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆinjxn(t)+Bijuj(t)∑i=1rjwij(t)=∑i=1rjhij(t)Aijxj(t)+∑k=1GjA¯ikjxj(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆinjxn(t)+Bijuj(t)with(2.4)wi⁡j(t)≡∏p=1δjMi⁡p⁡j(xp⁡j(t)),hij(t)≡wij(t)∑i=1rjwij(t)in which Mipj(xpj(t)) is the grade of membership of xpj(t) in Mipjand∑i=1rjhij(t)=1for all t.In the next subsection, the control design is carried out based on the fuzzy model via the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme.According to the decentralized control scheme, a set of model-based fuzzy controllers is synthesized via the technique of parallel distributed compensation (PDC) to stabilize the nonlinear multiple time-delay interconnected system N. The concept of PDC scheme is that each control rule is distributively designed for the corresponding rule of a T–S fuzzy model. The fuzzy controller shares the same fuzzy sets with the fuzzy model in the premise parts [12]. Since each rule of the fuzzy model is described by a linear state equation, a linear control theory can be used to design the consequent parts of a fuzzy controller. Moreover, we need to prove the global asymptotic stability of the PDC design. The resulting overall fuzzy controller, which is nonlinear in general, is achieved through fuzzy blending of each individual linear controller.Hence, the jth model-based fuzzy controller is in the following form (Fig. 1):Rule l: IF x1j(t) is Ml1jand … andxδjj(t)isMlδjjTHEN(2.5)uj(t)=−Kljxj(t),where l=1, 2,…, rj. The final output of the fuzzy controller is(2.6)uj(t)=−∑l=1rjwlj(t)Kljxj(t)∑l=1rjwlj(t)=−∑l=1rjhlj(t)Kljxj(t).In this section, the stability of the nonlinear multiple time-delay (NMTD) interconnected system N is examined under the influence of modeling errors.Substituting Eq. (2.6) into Eq. (2.1) and Eq. (2.3) yields the jth closed-loop subsystemN¯jas follows:(3.1)x˙j(t)=∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)(Aij−BijKlj)xj(t)+∑k=1GjA¯ikjxj(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆinjxn(t)+fj¯(xj(t))+∑k=1Gjgkj(xj(t−τkj))+∑n=1n≠jJbnj(xn(t))−∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)(Aij−BijKlj)xj(t)+∑k=1GjA¯ikjxj(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆinjxn(t)=∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)(Aij−BijKlj)xj(t)+∑k=1GjA¯ikjxj(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆinjxn(t)+ΔΦj(t).wherefj¯(xj(t))≡fj(xj(t),uj(t))withuj(t)=−∑i=1rjhij(t)Kijxj(t),ΔΦj(t)≡ej(t)+∑k=1Gje¯j(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJeˆnj(t)with(3.2)ej(t)≡fj¯(xj(t))−∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)(Aij−BijKlj)xj(t)(3.3)e¯j(t−τkj)≡gkj(xj(t−τkj))−∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)A¯ikjxj(t−τkj)=gkj(xj(t−τkj))−∑i=1rjhij(t)A¯ikjxj(t−τkj),(3.4)eˆnj(t)≡bnj(xn(t))−∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)Aˆinjxn(t)=bnj(xn(t))−∑i=1rjhij(t)Aˆinjxn(t),and ΔΦj(t) denotes the modeling error between the jth closed-loop nonlinear subsystem (3.1) and the jth closed-loop fuzzy model [Eqs. (2.3) and (2.6)].Suppose that there exist the bounding matrix ΔHiljsuch that(3.5)ΔΦj(t)≤∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)ΔHiljxj(t)for the trajectory xj(t) and the bounding matrix ΔHiljcan be described as follows:(3.6)ΔHilj=εiljHjwhere Hjis the specified structured bounding matrix andεilj≤1, for i, l=1, 2, ⋯, rj; j=1, 2, ⋯, J. Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) show that:(3.7)ΔΦjT(t)ΔΦj(t)≤∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)Hjxj(t)εilj∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)εiljHjxj(t)≤[Hjxj(t)]T[Hjxj(t)].Namely, the modeling error ΔΦj(t) is bounded by the specified structured bounding matrix Hj.Remark 3.1[16]: The following simple example describes the procedures for determining ɛiljand Hj. Assuming that the possible bounds for all elements in ΔHiljare(3.8)ΔHilj=Δhilj11Δhilj12Δhilj21Δhilj22where−γjrs≤Δhiljrs≤γjrsfor someγiljrs, r, s=1, 2 and i, l=1, 2, ⋯, rj; j=1, 2, ⋯, J.A possible description for the bounding matrix ΔHiljis:(3.9)ΔHilj=εilj1100εilj22γj11γj12γj21γj22=εiljHjwhere−1≤εiljrr≤1for r=1, 2. Note that ɛiljcan be chosen by other forms as long asεilj≤1. Then, the validity of Eq. (3.5) is checked in the simulation. If it is not satisfied, we can expand the bounds for all elements in ΔHiljand repeat the design procedures until Eq. (3.5) holds.In the following, a delay-dependent stability criterion is derived to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop NMTD large-scale systemN¯which consists of J closed-loop interconnected subsystems, as described in Eq. (3.1). Before examining the asymptotic stability ofN¯, a useful concept is given below.Lemma 1For the real matrices X and Y with appropriate dimension [30]:XTY+YTX≤ςXTX+ς−1YTYwhere ζ is a positive constant.The closed-loop nonlinear multiple time-delay interconnected systemN¯is asymptotically stable, if there exist two symmetric positive definite matrices Pjand ϑkjand positive constants νj, ψj, and κj(j=1, 2, ⋯, J), such that the following inequalities hold:(3.10a)Δilj≡∑k=1GjτkjQilkj+ϖj+θj<0fori,l=1,2,⋯,rj;j=1,2,⋯,J,(3.10b)∇ikj≡(νj−1GjA¯ikjTPj2A¯ikj−ϑkj)<0fori=1,2,⋯,rj;k=1,2,⋯,Gj;j=1,2,⋯,Jwhere(3.11)Qilkj≡(Aij−BijKlj)TPj+Pj(Aij−BijKlj)+ψjτkjHjTHj,(3.12)ϖj≡νjGj∑k=1Gjτkj2I+κjJ∑k=1Gjτkj2I+Gjψj−1Pj2+∑k=1Gjϑkj,(3.13)θj≡∑n=1n≠jJκn−1Gnmaxi(λM(AˆijnTPn2Aˆijn))I.Moreover,λM(AˆijnTPn2Aˆijn)denotes the maximum eigenvalue of the matrixAˆijnTPn2Aˆijn.Proof: See Appendix A.Remark 3.2.1: Since the matrices ϖjand θjare positive definite, the matrix Qilkjmust be chosen to be negative definite to meet the stability condition shown in Eq. (3.10a). Hence, based on Eq. (3.11), it shows that a larger delay τkjwill make Theorem 1 more difficult to satisfy.Remark 3.2.2: Based on Eq. (3.7), the modeling error ΔΦj(t) is assumed to be bounded by the specified structured bounding matrix Hjand then a larger modeling error results in a larger Hj. According to the same corollary discussed in Remark 3.2.1, a larger modeling error will cause Theorem 1 to be more difficult to satisfy.Remark 3.2.3: Eq. (3.10a) can be reformulated into a linear matrix inequality (LMI) via the following procedure.By introducing new variablesWj=Pj−1and Ylj=KljWj, Eq. (3.10a) can be rewritten as follows:(3.14)∑k=1GjτkjWjAijT−(BijYlj)T+AijWj−BijYlj+ψjτk⁡jWjHjTHjWj+WjνjGj∑k=1Gjτk⁡j2IWj+WjκjJ∑k=1Gjτk⁡j2IWj+Gjψj−1I+Wj∑k=1Gjϑk⁡jWj+Wj∑n=1n≠jJκn−1Gnmaxi(λM(Aˆi⁡j⁡nTPn2Aˆi⁡j⁡n))IWj<0for i, l=1, 2, ⋯, rj; j=1, 2, ⋯, J. Based on Schur's complement [31], it is easy to find that the matrix inequalities in Eq. (3.14) are equivalent to the following LMI:(3.15)ΓHjWj(HjWj)T−(∑k=1Gjτkj2ψj)−1I<0,for i, l=1, 2, ⋯, rj; j=1, 2, ⋯, J where(3.16)Γ=∑k=1Gjτk⁡jWjAijT−(BijYlj)T+AijWj−BijYlj+WjνjGj∑k=1Gjτk⁡j2IWj+WjκjJ∑k=1Gjτk⁡j2IWj+Gjψj−1I+Wj∑k=1Gjϑk⁡jWj+Wj∑n=1n≠jJκn−1Gnmaxi(λM(Aˆi⁡j⁡nTPn2Aˆi⁡j⁡n))IWjMoreover, Eq. (3.10b) is a linear matrix inequality (LMI) and it can be rewritten as follows:(3.17)−WjϑkjWjWjTA¯⁡i⁡k⁡jTPjTPjA¯ikjWj−νjGjI<0for i=1, 2, ⋯, rj; k=1, 2, ⋯, Gj; j=1, 2, ⋯, J.Therefore, Theorem 1 can be transformed into an LMI problem and efficient interior-point algorithms are now available in Matlab LMI Solver to solve this problem.Remark 3.2.4[32]: To verify the feasibility of solving the inequalities in Eqs. (3.15) and (3.17) using LMI Solver (Matlab), the interior-point optimization techniques are utilized to compute feasible solutions. Such techniques require that the systems of LMI is constrained to be strictly feasible, that is, the feasible set has a nonempty interior. For feasibility problems, the LMI Solver by feasp11feasp is the syntax used to test feasibility of a system of LMIs in MATLAB.is shown as follows:Find x such that the LMI22In this study, Eq. (3.18) can be represented as Eq. (3.15) or Eq. (3.17).(3.18)L(x)<0asMinimize t subject to(3.19)L(x)<t×I.From the above, the LMI constraint is always strictly feasible in x, t and the original LMI Eq. (3.18) is feasible if and only if the global minimum tmin33The global minimum tmin is the scalar value returned as the output argument by feasp.of Eq. (3.19) satisfies tmin<0. In other words, if tmin<0 will satisfy Eqs. (3.15) and (3.17) then the stability conditions Eqs. (3.10a) and (3.10b) in Theorem 1 can be met.Based on Theorem 1, a set of fuzzy controllers can be synthesized to asymptotically stabilize the NMTD interconnected system N. If the designed T–S fuzzy controllers cannot stabilize N, a batch of dithers (as the auxiliaries of the fuzzy controllers) is simultaneously introduced to stabilize it.A high frequency signal, commonly referred to as dither d(t), with a finite number η of switching, is injected into the jth subsystem of the nonlinear multiple time-delay (NMTD) interconnected system N. Thus, the jth dithered subsystem Njdis described as:(4.1)x˙jd(t)=fj(xjd(t),uj(t),d(t))+∑k=1Gjgkj(xjd(t−τkj),d(t))+∑n=1n≠jJbn⁡j(xn(t),d(t)).The algorithm for constructing the dither is given as follows [19]. The time interval [0,T] is divided into an arbitrary number η of equal subintervals. The beginning of the first interval, the end of the first interval, the end of the second interval, and the end of the ηth interval are denoted as t0, t1, t2,, and tη, respectively. After dividing every interval [tq, tq+1] for q=0, 1, 2,…, η−1 into ℓ subintervals, the length of the mth subinterval is αm(tq)[tq+1−tq] for m=1, 2, ⋯, ℓ and the controlV˙(t)=∑j=1JV˙j(t)=∑j=1J∑k=1Gj[τkj(x˙jT(t)Pjxj(t)+xjT(t)Pjx˙j(t))]+∑j=1J∑k=1Gj[xjT(t)ϑkjxj(t)−xjT(t−τk⁡j)ϑk⁡jxj(t−τk⁡j)]=∑j=1J∑k=1Gjτkj∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)((Aij−BijKlj)xj(t)+∑d=1GjA¯odjxj(t−τdj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆinjxn(t))+ΔΦj(t)TPjxj(t)+xjT(t)Pj∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)((Aij−BijKlj)xj(t)+∑d=1GjA¯idjxj(t−τdj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆinjxn(t)+ΔΦj(t)+∑j=1J∑k=1Gj[xjT(t)ϑkjxj(t)−xjT(t−τkj)ϑkjxj(t−τkj)]is applied at the mth subinterval. Hence, the repetition frequency, shape, and amplitude of the dither can be determined by regulating the parameters η, αm(tq) and βm(tq). Fig. 2provides an example of constructing a dither to illustrate the proposed algorithm.Remark 4.1.1: According to the above algorithm, the parameters αm(tq) and βm(tq) are constant if the dither is set as a periodic signal. To reduce the computational burden, the dither is hence chosen to be periodic signal and then αm(tq) and βm(tq) are changed to αmand βm, respectively.Moreover, the corresponding relaxed subsystem NjRof the jth dithered subsystem Eq. (4.1) is defined as [19]:(4.2)x˙jR(t)=∑m=1ℓαmfj(xjR(t),uj(t),βm)+∑k=1Gjgkj(xjR(t−τkj),βm)+∑n=1n≠jJbn⁡j(xnR(t),βm)where αmis a non-negative constant that satisfies the following conditions:0≤αm≤1,∑m=1ℓαm=1, for m=1, 2, ⋯, ℓ.Remark 4.1.2: The significance of dither's frequency lies in its effect on the deviation of the relaxed subsystem (4.2) from the dithered subsystem (4.1) and the deviation can be reduced as the dither's frequency increases.Remark 4.1.3: The curve xjR(t) that satisfies Eq. (4.2) is the uniform limit of curves xjd(t) satisfying (4.1). In other words, as the frequency of dither goes toward infinity, the trajectory xjd(t) described by the jth dithered subsystem Njdwill approach that of the jth relaxed subsystem NjRby applying the averaging method to the high-frequency dithered term. Hence, NjRmay be viewed as a mathematical model of Njdwith a dither of high enough frequency.Remark 4.1.4: In general, a set of periodic symmetrical square-wave dithers with uncertain amplitude ξ is intrors’ parameters to be determined. Thus, we have α1=α2=0.5 and β1=−β2=ξ and then the amplitude of dither ξ is found to stabilize the NMTD interconnected system N.In this subsection, the jth relaxed subsystem NjRis approximated by a T–S fuzzy model. The procedures of constructing the T–S fuzzy model for NjRare similar to those in Section 2, and are omitted here. The final output of the jth closed-loop relaxed subsystemN¯jRcan be described as follows:(4.3)x˙jR(t)=∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)(Ai⁡jR−Bi⁡jRKl⁡j)xjR(t)+∑k=1GjA¯ikjRxjR(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆi⁡n⁡jRxnR(t)+fj¯(xjR(t))+∑m=1ℓ∑k=1Gjαmgkj(xjR(t−τkj),βm)+∑m=1ℓ∑n=1n≠jJαmbnj(xn⁡R(t),βm)−∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhi⁡j(t)hl⁡j(t)(Ai⁡jR−Bi⁡jRKl⁡j)xjR(t)+∑k=1GjA¯ikjRxjR(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆi⁡n⁡jRxnR(t)=∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhi⁡j(t)hlj(t)(Ai⁡j⁡R−Bi⁡jRKlj)xjR(t)+∑k=1GjA¯ikjRxjR(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJAˆi⁡n⁡jRxnR(t)+ΔΦjR(t).wherefj¯(xjR(t))≡∑m=1ℓαmfj(xjR(t),uj(t),βm)withuj(t)=−∑i=1rjhij(t)KijxjR(t),ΔΦjR(t)≡ejR(t)+∑k=1Gje¯jR(t−τkj)+∑n=1n≠jJeˆn⁡jR(t)with(4.4)ejR(t)≡fj¯(xjR(t))−∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhi⁡j(t)hl⁡j(t)(Ai⁡jR−B⁡i⁡jRKl⁡j)xjR(t),(4.5)e¯jR(t−τkj)≡∑m=1ℓαmgkj(xjR(t−τkj),βm)−∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)A¯ikjRxjR(t−τkj)=∑m=1ℓαmgkj(xjR(t−τkj),βm)−∑i=1rjhi⁡j(t)A¯ikjRxjR(t−τkj),(4.6)eˆn⁡jR(t)≡∑m=1ℓαmbn⁡j(xnR(t),βm)−∑i=1rj∑l=1rjhij(t)hlj(t)AˆinjRxnR(t)=∑m=1ℓαmbnj(xnR(t),βm)−∑i=1rjhij(t)AˆinjRxnR(t).Hereafter, we are concerned with the stability of the closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯Rinstead of discussing that of the closed-loop dithered interconnected systemN¯d. Hence, the stability criterion ofN¯Ris presented as follows.Theorem 2:The closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯Ris asymptotically stable if there exist two symmetric positive definite matrices PjRand ϑkjRand positive constants νjR, ψjRand κjR(j=1, 2, ⋯, J) such that the following inequalities hold:44The representation of HjRis the same as that of the structured bounding matrix Hjin Eq.

This proof is lengthy, so it is not added here.Remark 4.3.1: By the same procedures as those in Remark 3.2.3, Eqs. (4.7a) and (4.7b) can be rewritten as the following LMIs:(4.11a)ΓRHjRWjR(HjRWjR)T−(∑k=1Gjτkj2ψjR)−1I<0(4.11b)−WjRϑk⁡jRWjRWjRTA¯i⁡k⁡jRTPjRTPjRA¯i⁡k⁡jRWjR−νjRGjI<0,for i, l=1, 2, ⋯, rj; j=1, 2, ⋯, J and m=1, 2, ⋯, ℓwhereΓR=∑k=1Gjτk⁡jWjRA⁡⁡ijRT−(BijR⁡YljR)T+AijRWj⁡R−BijR⁡YljR+WjRνjRGj∑k=1Gjτk⁡j2IWjR+WjRκjRJ∑k=1Gjτk⁡j2IWjR+GjψjR−1⁡I+WjR∑k=1Gjϑ⁡k⁡j⁡RWjR+WjR∑n=1n≠jJκ⁡nR−1Gnmaxi(λM(Aˆi⁡j⁡nRTPnR2Aˆi⁡j⁡nR))IWjR.Remark 4.3.2: Similarly, following Remark 3.2.4, it is possible to solve the inequalities Eqs. (4.11a) and (4.11b) via the LMI Solver. If tmin<0 will allow Eqs. (4.11a) and (4.11b) to be satisfied and then the stability conditions Eqs. (4.7a) and (4.7b) in Theorem 2 can be met.Prior to discussing the stability of the closed-loop dithered interconnected systemN¯d, the stability properties in finite time intervals are defined according to Weiss and Infante [33] as follows.Definition 4.3.1: A system is stable with respect to the set{ℏ1,ℏ2,−τmax,T,x}, ℏ1≤ℏ2, if for any trajectory x(t) satisfies the conditionsx(0)<ℏ1, implyx(t)<ℏ2for t∈[−τmax, T], in which τmax is the maximal value of τikj's.Definition 4.3.2: A system is contractively stable with respect to the set{ℏ1,ℏ2,ℏ3,−τmax,T,x}, ℏ3<ℏ1<ℏ2, if any trajectory x(t) satisfies the conditionsx(0)<ℏ1. This implies: stability with respect to{ℏ1,ℏ2,−τmax,T,x}, (b) there exists t1∈(0, T] such thatx(t)<ℏ2for all t∈[t1, T].The closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯Rmay be stabilized by regulating the parameters αmand βm. IfN¯Ris stable and the number η of switching in d(t) is large enough, then the closed-loop dithered interconnected systemN¯dis approximated byN¯Rand the approximation improves as η increases. Hence, the trajectories ofN¯dandN¯Rcan be made as close as desired. This makes it possible to obtain a rigorous prediction of the stability ofN¯dbased on the one ofN¯R, provided that η is sufficiently large.Hence, we can deduce the following important theorems.Theorem 3The state vector xd(t)55xd(t)≡[x1d(t)x2d(t)…xJd(t)]Tand xR(t)≡[x1R(t)x2R(t)…xJR(t)]T.of the closed-loop dithered interconnected systemN¯dis stable with respect to{ℏ1,ℏ2,−τmax,T,x}if the closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯Ris stable in the sense of Lyapunov, provided that η is sufficiently large.Proof: The algorithm for constructing a dither d(t) given in subsection 4.1 provides a means by which the solutions xd(t) of the closed-loop dithered interconnected systemN¯dand xR(t) of the closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯Rsatisfy:limη→∞xd(t)−xR(t)=0Thus, for a certain η, we have:(4.12)xd(t)−xR(t)<ρ1.If the closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯Ris stable in the sense of Lyapunov, i.e. for each ρ, it is possible to find a Ψ such thatxR(0)<Ψ, and we have:xR(t)<ρfor t>−τmax.Thus, from Eq. (4.12):xd(t)=xd(t)−xR(t)+xR(t)≤xd(t)−xR(t)+xR(t)<ρ1+ρBy taking ℏ1=Ψ, ℏ2=ρ+ρ1 stability with respect to{ℏ1,ℏ2,−τmax,T,x}is proven.Theorem 4The state vector xd(t) of the closed-loop dithered interconnected systemN¯dis contractively stable with respect to{ℏ1,ℏ2,ℏ3,−τmax,T,x}, if the closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯Ris asymptotically stable, provided that η is sufficiently large.Proof: Let the closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯Rbe asymptotically stable. One may select a T large enough so that for a time t1∈(0, T], we have in addition to the stability properties proven in Theorem 3,xR(t)<ρ2for t∈[t1, T], where ρ2 is arbitrarily small. Choosing ℏ1=Ψ, ℏ2=ρ+ρ1 and ℏ3=ρ1+ρ2, it follows that the closed-loop dithered interconnected systemN¯dis contractively stable with respect to{ℏ1,ℏ2,ℏ3,−τmax,T,x}.The complete design procedure can be summarized in the following algorithm.Problem: Given a nonlinear multiple time-delay (NMTD) large-scale system N composed of J interconnected subsystems Nj, j=1, 2,⋯, J, the problem is centered on how to synthesize a set of fuzzy controllers and find appropriate dithers to stabilize N?We can solve this problem according to the following steps.Step 1:Construct the T–S fuzzy model for each interconnected subsystem of N.According to the decentralized control scheme and the technique of parallel distributed compensation (PDC), a set of fuzzy controllers is synthesized to stabilize N. Subsequently, adjust the feedback gains Kljand verify the stability conditions of the closed-loop interconnected systemN¯by means of Theorem 1, Remarks 3.2.3 and 3.2.4.If the stability conditions of Theorem 1 cannot be satisfied by adjusting the feedback gains Klj, a batch of periodic symmetrical square-wave dithers is injected into the NMTD interconnected system N.Establish the relaxed interconnected system NR.Reconstruct the T–S fuzzy model for each interconnected subsystem of NR.According to Theorems 2–4, we can regulate the dithers’ parameters (αm, βm) to stabilize the closed-loop dithered interconnected systemN¯d.The following example illustrates the effectiveness of the algorithm above.Example: The purpose of this example is to synthesize a set of T–S fuzzy controllers such that the following NMTD large-scale system N composed of three interconnected subsystems, which are described as follows, can be asymptotically stabilized.Subsystem 1:(6.1)x˙11(t)=−4.5x11(t)+0.2x112(t)−2x21(t)+0.1x112(t−0.12)+0.2x21(t−0.15)−0.2x122(t)−0.1x22(t)−0.7x132(t)−0.3x23(t)x˙21(t)=−2.5x11(t)−5.5x21(t)+0.1x21(t−0.12)+0.8x11(t−0.15)Subsystem 2:(6.2)x˙12(t)=−5x12(t)+0.2x122(t)−1.5x22(t)+0.1x122(t−0.13)+0.2x22(t−0.16)−0.2x132(t)−0.1x23(t)−0.7x112(t)−0.3x21(t)x˙22(t)=−3x12(t)−5x22(t)+0.1x22(t−0.13)+0.8x12(t−0.16)Subsystem 3:(6.3)x˙13(t)=−5.5x13(t)+0.2x132(t)−2.5x23(t)+0.1x132(t−0.14)+0.2x23(t−0.17)−0.2x112(t)−0.1x21(t)−0.7x122(t)−0.3x22(t)x˙23(t)=−3.5x13(t)−4.5x23(t)+0.1x23(t−0.14)+0.8x13(t−0.17)Solution: We can solve the above problem according to the following steps.Step 1: Construct the T–S fuzzy model for each interconnected subsystem of N. To minimize the design effort and complexity, we try to use as few rules as possible. Hence, the subsystems (6.1–6.3) are approximated with the following fuzzy models:The fuzzy model of Subsystem 1:Rule 1: IF x11(t) is M111THENx˙1(t)=A11x1(t)+∑k=12A¯1k1x1(t−τk1)+∑n=23Aˆ1n1xn(t)+B11u1(t),Rule 2: IF x11(t) is M211THENx˙1(t)=A21x1(t)+∑k=12A¯2k1x1(t−τk1)+∑n=23Aˆ2n1xn(t)+B21u1(t),wherex1T(t)=[x11(t)x21(t)], τ11=0.12(s), τ21=0.15(s),(6.4)A11=−4.5−2−2.5−5.5,A21=−4.74−2−2.5−5.5,A¯111=−2.85*10−6000.1,A¯121=00.20.80,A¯211=−0.1149000.1,A¯221=00.20.80,Aˆ121=1.615*10−6−0.100,Aˆ131=3.56*10−5−0.300,Aˆ221=0.34−0.100,Aˆ231=1.12−0.300,B11=11,B21=11and the membership functions for Rule 1 and Rule 2 are:M111(x11(t))=x11(t)+4.74−4.5+4.74,M211(x11(t))=1−M111(x11(t)),The fuzzy model of Subsystem 2:Rule 1: IF x12(t) is M112THENx˙2(t)=A12x2(t)+∑k=12A¯1k2x2(t−τk2)+∑n=1n≠23Aˆ1n2xn(t)+B⁡12u⁡2(t),,Rule 2: IF x12(t) is M212THENx˙2(t)=A22x2(t)+∑k=12A¯2k2x2(t−τk2)+∑n=1n≠23Aˆ2n2xn(t)+B⁡22⁡u⁡2(t),wherex2T(t)=[x12(t)x22(t)], τ12=0.13(sec), τ22=0.16(sec),(6.5)A12=−5−1.5−3−5,A22=−5.34−1.5−3−5,A¯112=−1.162*10−6000.1,A¯122=00.20.80,A¯212=−0.1514000.1,A¯222=00.20.80,Aˆ112=1.444*10−5−0.300,Aˆ132=−0.2−0.100,Aˆ212=0.84−0.300,Aˆ232=0.32−0.100,B12=11,B22=11and the membership functions for Rule 1 and Rule 2 are: M112(x12(t))=(x12(t)+5.34)/(−5+5.34), M212(x12(t))=1−M112(x12(t)),The fuzzy model of Subsystem 3:Rule 1: IF x13(t) is M113THENx˙3(t)=A13x3(t)+∑k=12A¯1k3x(t−τk3)3+∑n=12Aˆ1n3xn(t)+B13u3(t),Rule 2: IF x13(t) is M213THENx˙3(t)=A23x3(t)+∑k=12A¯2k3x3(t−τk3)+∑n=12Aˆ2n3xn(t)+B23u3(t),wherex3T(t)=[x13(t)x23(t)], τ13=0.14(sec), τ23=0.17(sec),(6.6)A13=−5.3−2.5−3.5−4.5,A23=−5.82−2.5−3.5−4.5,A¯113=−7.335*10−6000.1,A¯123=00.20.80,A¯213=4.0864*10-6000.01,Aˆ213=0.24−0.100,A¯223=00.20.80,Aˆ113=4.126*10−6−0.100,Aˆ123=5.652*10−6−0.300,Aˆ223=1.19−0.300,B13=11,B23=11and the membership functions for Rule 1 and Rule 2 are:M113(x13(t))=x13(t)+5.82−5.3+5.82,M213(x13(t))=1−M113(x13(t)).Step 2: In order to stabilize the nonlinear multiple time-delay (NMTD) interconnected system N shown in (6.1–6.3), three model-based fuzzy controllers designed via the concept of PDC scheme are synthesized as follows.Fuzzy controller of Subsystem 1:Rule 1: IF x11(t) is M111 Rule 2: IF x11(t) is M211THEN u1(t)=−K11x1(t), THEN(6.7a)u1(t)=−K21x1(t).According to Eq. (2.6), we have the fuzzy controller of Subsystem 1:(6.7b)u1(t)=−∑l=12wl1(t)Kl1x1(t)∑l=12wl1(t)=−∑l=12hl1(t)Kl1x1(t).Fuzzy controller of Subsystem 2:Rule 1: IF x12(t) is M112 Rule 2: IF x12(t) is M212THEN u2(t)=−K12x2(t), THEN(6.8a)u2(t)=−K22⁡x2(t).According to Eq.

(3.10a) must be negative definite to meet the stability conditions of Theorem 1. First, based on Eqs. (6.4)–(6.10), Eqs. (3.15) and (3.17), we can obtain the following common solutions Wjand Yijvia the Matlab LMI optimization toolbox with ν1=1, ν2=10, 000, ν3=1, ψ1=50, ψ2=100, ψ3=0.1, κ1=200, κ2=10, κ3=4000.W1=7.7611−10.761−10.76149.5437,W2=108×0.4864−1.9459−1.94597.7842,W3=43.9001−66.5937−66.5937302.1865,Y11=104×1.69761.6976,Y21=104×1.69771.6977,Y12=103×2.50292.5028,Y22=657.4299657.4299,Y13=104×1.48631.4863,Y23=104×1.48651.4865.Then, the feedback gainsKlj=YljWj−1are(6.11)K11=103×3.80981.1701,K21=103×3.80991.1702,K12=123.607430.8993,K22=32.4688.1163,K13=620.6727185.9657,K23=620.7483185.9886and the best value tmin of LMI Solver (Matlab) is 6.1237. According to Remark 3.2.4, the designed fuzzy controllers cannot stabilize the interconnected system N.Step 3: Based on Remark 4.1.4, a set of periodic symmetrical square-wave dithers with sufficiently high frequencies is injected into the NMTD interconnected system N. Then, the dithered interconnected system Ndcan be written as follows:Subsystem 1:(6.12)N1dx˙11(t)=−4.5x11(t)+0.2d(t)+x11(t)2−2x21(t)+0.1d(t)+x11(t−0.12)2+0.2x21(t−0.15)−0.2d(t)+x12(t)2−0.1x22(t)−0.7d(t)+x13(t)2−0.3x23(t)+u1(t)x˙21(t)=−2.5x11(t)−5.5x21(t)+0.1x21(t−0.12)+0.8x11(t−0.15)+u1(t)Subsystem 2:(6.13)N2dx˙12(t)=−5x12(t)+0.2d(t)+x12(t)2−1.5x22(t)+0.1d(t)+x12(t−0.13)2+0.2x22(t−0.16)−0.2d(t)+x13(t)2−0.1x23(t)−0.7d(t)+x11(t)2−0.3x21(t)+u2(t)x˙22(t)=−3x12(t)−5x22(t)+0.1x22(t−0.13)+0.8x12(t−0.16)+u2(t)Subsystem 3:(6.14)N3dx˙13(t)=−5.5x13(t)+0.2d(t)+x13(t)2−2.5x23(t)+0.1d(t)+x13(t−0.14)2+0.2x23(t−0.17)−0.2d(t)+x11(t)2−0.1x21(t)−0.7d(t)+x12(t)2−0.3x22(t)+u3(t)x˙23(t)=−3.5x13(t)−4.5x23(t)+0.1x23(t−0.14)+0.8x13(t−0.17)+u3(t)Step 4: According to Eq.

The procedures for constructing the fuzzy model ofN¯Rare similar to those in Step 1 and the feedback gains Kljare chosen to be the same as those in Eq. (6.11).Step 6: In accordance with Remark 3.1, the specified structured bounding matrices HjRand ɛiljRare set as10000100and1001. To satisfy the stability conditions of Theorem 2, all the matrices of ΔiljR(αm, βm) and ∇ikjR(αm, βm) depending on the dither's amplitude ξ must be negative definite. Hence, following Remark 4.3.2, this study focuses on how to regulate the dither's amplitude ξ such that the best value tmin of LMI Solver (Matlab) is negative. Fig. 3shows the best value tmin with respect to the dither's amplitude ξ.From Fig. 3, we can see that the inequalities in (4.7a) and (4.7b) are satisfied (i.e., the closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯Ris asymptotically stable) if the dither's amplitude ξ is within the range (0.159, 0.3) Furthermore, the illustration in Fig. 4.1–4.3shows that the assumption ofΔΦjR(t)≤∑i=12∑l=12hij(t)hlj(t)ΔHiljRxjR(t)for j=1, 2, 3 is satisfied with ξ=0.2 and initial conditions: x11(0)=−1.2, x21(0)=1.2, x12(0)=−1.7, x22(0)=1.85, x13(0)=−1.6 and x23(0)=1.5.According to Theorem 4, the closed-loop dithered interconnected systemN¯dis contractively stable as long as the number η of switching is large enough. The time responses of x11(t), x21(t), x12(t), x22(t), x13(t) and x23(t) forN¯d(ξ=0.2, ω=1000rad/s (blue line) and ω=2 rad/s (green line)) and the closed-loop relaxed interconnected systemN¯R(red line) are shown in Fig. 5a–f. Clearly, the trajectories ofN¯dcan be approximated by those ofN¯Rand the approximation improves as the dither's frequency increases. In other words, the fuzzy controllers (6.7)–(6.9) and (6.11) can stabilize the interconnected system, Eqs. (6.1)–(6.3), if the amplitude of dither ξ is within the range (0.159, 0.3) as dither's frequency is high enough.

A robustness design of fuzzy control via the model-based approach is proposed in this study to overcome the influence of modeling error. First, a T–S fuzzy model is constructed for each interconnected subsystem. Next, the control design is carried out based on the T–S fuzzy model via the technique of parallel distributed compensation (PDC). A delay-dependent stability criterion is derived from Lyapunov's direct method to ensure the asymptotic stability of the nonlinear multiple time-delay (NMTD) interconnected system. Subsequently, the stability conditions of this criterion are reformulated into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). According to the LMIs and the decentralized control scheme, a set of model-based fuzzy controllers is synthesized to stabilize the NMTD interconnected system. If the designed fuzzy controllers cannot stabilize the NMTD interconnected system, a batch of dithers (as the auxiliaries of the fuzzy controllers) is injected into it. Conclusively, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy controllers can stabilize the NMTD interconnected system by regulating the dithers’ parameters.Let the Lyapunov function forN¯be defined as(A1)V(t)=∑j=1JVj(t)=∑j=1J∑k=1GjτkjxjT(t)Pjxj(t)+∑k=1Gj∫0τkjxjT(t−π)ϑkjxj(t−π)dπ,where the weighting matricesPj=PjT>0andϑkj=ϑk⁡jT>0.We then evaluate the time derivative of V(t) on the trajectories of Eq.
