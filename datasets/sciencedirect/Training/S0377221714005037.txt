@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Consider a general coherent system with independent or dependent components, and assume that the components are randomly chosen from two different stocks, with the components of the first stock having better reliability than the others. Then here we provide sufficient conditions on the component’s lifetimes and on the random numbers of components chosen from the two stocks in order to improve the reliability of the whole system according to different stochastic orders. We also discuss several examples in which such conditions are satisfied and an application to the study of the optimal random allocation of components in series and parallel systems. As a novelty, our study includes the case of coherent systems with dependent components by using basic mathematical tools (and copula theory).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Coherent systems are basic concepts in reliability theory (see, e.g., Barlow & Proschan (1981) and Kuo & Zhu (2012) for a detailed introduction to coherent systems, related properties and applications). Series systems, parallel systems and k-out-of-n systems are particular cases of coherent systems. In the theory of coherent systems, it is important to study the performance of a system composed by different kinds of units, and to define the optimal allocation of these units in the system. Some results on this topic are given in da Costa Bueno (2005), da Costa Bueno and do Carmo (2007), Li and Ding (2010), Brito, Zequeira, and Valdés (2011), Misra, Dhariyal, and Gupta (2009), Navarro and Rychlik (2010), Zhang (2010), Eryilmaz (2012), Kuo and Zhu (2012), Zhao, Chan, Li, and Ng (2013), Zhao, Chan, and Ng (2012), Belzunce, Martínez-Puertas, and Ruiz (2013), Levitin, Xing, and Dai (2014), and Hazra and Nanda (2014). In this context, a translation of the Parrondo’s paradox was proposed in Di Crescenzo (2007). Parrondo’s paradox shows that, in game theory, sometimes a random strategy might be a better option than any deterministic strategy. Analogously, Di Crescenzo (2007) proves that in a series system with independent non-identically distributed components, the random choice of these components is a better option than to use components with different distributions in the system. Indeed, Di Crescenzo (2007) proved that, in some situations, a random choice is the best option when we have to choose between two kinds of units having different behaviors. This result was extended to other system structures and to the case of dependent components in Navarro and Spizzichino (2010). More recently, the analysis of series and parallel systems formed by components having independent lifetimes and randomly chosen from two different stocks has been performed in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011). In that paper, they assume that the components can be chosen from two stocks, where the items of a batch are better than those of the other one in the usual stochastic order. Under these assumptions, they obtain conditions on the random numbers of components chosen from the two stocks such that the reliability of system’s lifetime improves. Similar results were obtained recently in Hazra and Nanda (2014) for other stochastic orders and for series and parallel systems with independent components.In this paper we extend the results given in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011) and Hazra and Nanda (2014) for series and parallel systems with independent components to general coherent systems with arbitrary structures and with possibly dependent components. We also show that these results can be used to study the optimal random allocation in a coherent system of components chosen from two different stocks.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recall useful notions and definitions, such as the definitions of the stochastic orders used to compare the performances of systems, and the notion of copula, which is used to formally describe the dependence between the component lifetimes. We also describe the model of coherent systems with a random number of components chosen from different stocks. Section 3 contains the main results, which are centered on conditions to improve these systems in the stochastic, hazard rate, reversed hazard rate and likelihood ratio orders. In Section 4 we study ordering properties for systems in which the units are chosen randomly by means of Bernoulli trials. Several examples are provided in Section 5 to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular, certain general results are obtained for series systems when the dependence between the components is modeled by an Archimedean copula. An application to the study of the optimal random allocation of components in series and parallel systems is given in Section 6. Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Section 7.Hereafter some conventions and notations used throughout the paper are given. The notation=ststands for equality in distribution. We write “increasing” instead of “non-decreasing” and “decreasing” instead of “non-increasing”. Also, we will denote byDig(x1,…,xm)the partial derivative with respect toxiof the function g, i.e.,Dig(x1,…,xm)=∂∂xig(x1,…,xm)whenever it exists. Moreover, we shall use the usual notation(a,b)for the open interval of real numbers(a,b)={x∈R:a<x<b}. Analogously,[a,b]represents the closed interval.Firstly, we briefly recall the definitions of the stochastic orders that will be used throughout the paper to compare random lifetimes or the random numbers of components chosen from the two stocks. For further details, basic properties and applications of these orders, we refer the reader to Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), or to Barlow and Proschan (1981) where, in particular, a list of applications in reliability theory is described.Let X and Y be two absolutely continuous random variables having common support[0,∞), distribution functions F and G, and reliability (or survival) functionsF‾=1-FandG‾=1-G, respectively. Let f and g be their probability density functions,λX=f/F‾andλY=g/G‾be their hazard functions andλ̃X=f/Fandλ̃Y=g/Gbe their reversed hazard functions, respectively. We say that X is smaller than Y–in the usual stochastic order (denoted byX≤stY) ifF‾(t)⩽G‾(t)for allt∈[0,∞),in the hazard rate order (denoted byX≤hrY) ifλX(t)⩾λY(t)for allt∈[0,∞), i.e., if the ratioF‾(t)/G‾(t)is decreasing in[0,∞),in the reversed hazard rate order (denoted byX≤rhrY) ifλ̃X(t)⩽λ̃Y(t)for allt∈[0,∞), i.e., if the ratioF(t)/G(t)is decreasing in[0,∞),in the likelihood ratio order (denoted byX≤lrY) if the ratiof(t)/g(t)is decreasing in[0,∞),in the convex order (denoted byX≤cxY) ifE(ψ(X))⩽E(ψ(Y))for all convex functionsψfor which both expectations exist,in the increasing convex order (denoted byX≤icxY) ifE(ψ(X))⩽E(ψ(Y))for all increasing convex functionsψfor which both expectations exist,in the increasing concave order (denoted byX≤icvY) ifE(ψ(X))⩽E(ψ(Y))for all increasing concave functionsψfor which both expectations exist.In particular here we just point out that–X≤hrYif, and only if,[X-t∣X>t]≤st[Y-t∣Y>t]for allt∈[0,∞),X≤rhrYif, and only if,[t-X∣X⩽t]≥st[t-Y∣Y⩽t]for allt∈[0,∞),X≤lrYif, and only if,[X∣a⩽X⩽b]≤st[Y∣a⩽X⩽b]for alla⩽b.Hence, the hazard rate order and the reversed hazard rate order are often employed to compare residual lifetimes and inactivity times of systems, respectively, and the likelihood ratio order can be used to compare both residual lifetimes and inactivity times, while this is not the case for the weaker usual stochastic order. Moreover, the following relationships are well known:X≤lrY⇒X≤hrY⇓⇓X≤rhrY⇒X≤stY⇒X≤icx,icvY.Dealing with vectors of possibly dependent lifetimes, a common tool to describe the dependence is by means of its copula. Given a vectorX=(X1,…,Xm)of lifetimes, having joint distribution F and marginal distributionsF1,…,Fm, the functionC:[0,1]m→R+is said to be the copula ofXifF(x1,…,xm)=C(F1(x1),…,Fm(xm)),forall(x1,…,xm)∈Rm.If the marginal distributionsFi, fori=1,…,m, are continuous, then the copula C is unique and it is defined asC(u1,…,um)=FF1-1(u1),…,Fm-1(um)=P(F1(X1)⩽u1,…,Fm(Xm)⩽um)foru1,…,um∈(0,1). Copulas entirely describe the dependence between the components of a random vector; for example, concordance indexes like the Spearman’sρor Kendall’sτof a vectorXcan be defined by means of its copula (see Nelsen (2006) for a monograph on copulas and their properties).In reliability, often the survival copula S instead of the copula C is considered. LetXhave joint reliability functionF‾and marginal reliability functionsF‾1,…,F‾m; then the functionS:[0,1]m→R+is said to be the survival copula ofXifF‾(x1,…,xm)=S(F‾1(x1),…,F‾m(xm)),forall(x1,…,xm)∈Rm.Among copulas (or survival copulas), particularly interesting is the class of Archimedean copulas. A copula is said to be Archimedean if it can be written as(2.1)C(u1,…,um)=W‾∑i=1mW‾-1(ui)forallui∈[0,1]for a suitable decreasing and m-monotone functionW‾:[0,∞)→[0,1]such thatW‾(0)=1and with inverse functionW‾-1. The functionW‾is usually called the generator of the Archimedean copula C. As pointed out in Nelsen (2006), many standard distributions (such as the ones in Gumbel, Frank, Clayton and Ali–Mikhail–Haq families) are special cases of this class. We also refer the reader to Müller and Scarsini (2005) or McNeil and Nes̆lehová (2009), and references therein, for details, properties and recent applications of Archimedean copulas. All the Archimedean copulas are exchangeable, that is,C(u1,…,um)=C(uσ(1),…,uσ(m))for any permutationσ.The model considered in this paper is described here. We consider a coherent system formed by m components, whose (possibly dependent) random lifetimes are denoted byX1,…,Xk,Yk+1,…,Ym. These lifetimes come from two distinct classesCX={X1,…,Xk}andCY={Yk+1,…,Ym}, having sizes k andm-k, respectively. Given two preassigned random lifetimes X and Y, we assume that the lifetimes belonging toCXare identically distributed to X and those inCYare identically distributed to Y. Denote byF‾X(t)=P(X>t)andF‾Y(t)=P(Y>t)their respective reliability functions.From Barlow and Proschan (1981), we know that the system lifetime can be written as a functionϕ:Rm→R(which only depends on the structure of the system) of the component lifetimes. Thus we denote byT0=ϕ(Y1,…,Ym)andTm=ϕ(X1,…,Xm)the system lifetimes obtained from identically distributed (i.d.) components from classesCYandCX, respectively. In a similar way, we denote byTk=ϕ(X1,…,Xk,Yk+1,…,Ym)the system lifetime with k i.d. components fromCXandm-ki.d. components fromCY, fork=1,2,…,m-1. Note that, without loss of generality, we are assuming that the first k components are inCXand the last ones are inCY(in other cases, we just need to change the functionϕ).We assume that the joint reliability function of the component lifetimes can be written as(2.2)P(X1>t1,…,Xk>tk,Yk+1>tk+1,…,Ym>tm)=SF‾X(t1),…,F‾X(tk),F‾Y(tk+1),…,F‾Y(tm)fort1,…,tm⩾0and fork=0,1,…,m, where S is a fixed survival copula of dimension m, that is, we assume that the copula does not depend on k. Hence, due to Eq. (2.2), the possible dependence among the components is expressed by the survival copula solely. In other words, the dependence is due to the system (by effect of the common environment, of the position of the components, etc.), and not by the number k of components which came fromCX. The independence case can be included in this general model by choosing the product copulaS(u1,…,um)=u1…um.The reliability function of the system can then be written as(2.3)F‾Tk(t)=HF‾X(t),…,F‾X(t)︸k-times,F‾Y(t),…,F‾Y(t)︸(m-k)-times,t>0,whereH:[0,1]m→[0,1]is called domination function (see, e.g. Navarro & Spizzichino (2010) or Navarro, del Aguila, Sordo, & Suarez-Llorens (2013), Navarro, del Aguila, Sordo, & Suarez-Llorens (in press)). The domination function H is increasing in[0,1]mand satisfiesH(0,…,0)=0andH(1,…,1)=1. However, in general, H is not necessarily a copula. Moreover, it only depends on the functionϕ(the structure of the system) and on the survival copula S (the dependence model). As example,(i)for the series systems we haveH(u)=S(u)for anyu=(u1,…,um)∈[0,1]m;for a 2-out-of-3 system (i.e., a system with three components which works if at least two components work), the domination function isIf the system components are independent, then H only depends on the system structure. For example, in a 2-out-of-3 system with independent components we haveH(u1,u2,u3)=u1u2+u1u3+u2u3-2u1u2u3.We note that ifX⩾stY, as H is increasing, then(2.4)Tk≤stTk+1fork=0,1,…,m-1.This expresses the intuitive result by which the system with more ‘good’ components is always more reliable. Hereafter we aim to generalize this result to the case when the size of the two classesCXandCYis random. To this purpose we remark that if k is chosen randomly according to a discrete random variable K with support included in{0,1,…,m}, then the system reliability function is(2.5)F‾TK(t)=∑k=0mHF‾X(t),…,F‾X(t)︸k-times,F‾Y(t),…,F‾Y(t)︸(m-k)-timesP(K=k).Similarly, one can consider the cumulative distribution functions instead of the reliability (survival) functions, i.e., expressing the possible dependence in the component’s vector by their joint distribution function which can be written asP(X1⩽t1,…,Xk⩽tk,Yk+1⩽tk+1,…,Ym⩽tm)=C(FX(t1),…,FX(tk),FY(tk+1),…,FY(tm))fork=0,1,…,m, where C is a fixed copula of dimension m. We recall again that the copula is always the same, independently on k. Thus, the cumulative distribution function of the system with lifetimeTkcan be written asFTk(t)=H∼FX(t),…,FX(t)︸k-times,FY(t),…,FY(t)︸(m-k)-times,whereH∼only depends onϕand on C. For instance, for a parallel system, we haveH∼=C. We remark that the functionH∼is increasing in[0,1]mand satisfiesH∼(0,…,0)=0andH∼(1,…,1)=1. However,H∼is not necessarily a copula.If k is chosen randomly according to a discrete random variable K with support included in{0,1,…,m}, then, similarly to (2.5), we have(2.6)FTK(t)=∑k=0mH∼FX(t),…,FX(t)︸k-times,FY(t),…,FY(t)︸(m-k)-timesP(K=k).For what it concerns conditions on the system and on the random numbers of components chosen from the two stocks such that stochastic comparisons between the lifetimes of the corresponding systems are satisfied, a first result immediately follows from Theorem 1.A.6 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007). Hereafter we denote byTKithe lifetime of the system obtained when the size k of the classCXis chosen randomly according to the random variableKiwith support included in{0,1,…,m}, fori=1,2.Proposition 3.1LetX⩾stY; if k is chosen randomly according to two different random variablesK1andK2with supports included in{0,1,…,m}, and ifK1≤stK2, thenTK1≤stTK2.Theorem 1 in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011) proves that conditionK1≤stK2in the preceding proposition can be replaced by the weaker conditionK1≤icxK2when the system is a series system with independent components. Analogously, Theorem 2 in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011) proves that conditionK1≤stK2in the preceding proposition can be replaced by the weaker conditionK1≤icvK2when the system is a parallel system with independent components. In order to extend these properties to other coherent systems and other dependence models, we need the following lemma. First we introduce the following notation(3.1)zj=zj(u,v)=u,…,u︸j-times,v,…,v︸(m-j)-timesforj=0,…,m.Lemma 3.1Ifφ(k)=H(zk)is convex (concave) in{0,…,m}for allu,v∈(0,1)andψ:R→Ris an increasing function, thenη(k)=E(ψ(Tk))is convex (concave) in{0,…,m}.To prove thatη(k)is convex (concave), let us verify thatη(k+1)-η(k)⩾η(k)-η(k-1)(⩽)fork=1,…,m-1. This is equivalent toη(k+1)+η(k-1)⩾2η(k)(⩽)fork=1,…,m-1. From (2.3), the reliability function ofTkis given byF‾Tk(t)=H(zk)whenu=F‾X(t)andv=F‾Y(t). Let us define the random variable Z asTk+1with probability1/2and asTk-1with probability1/2. Then the reliability function of Z isF‾Z(t)=12F‾Tk-1(t)+12F‾Tk+1(t)=12H(zk-1)+12H(zk+1).Hence, asφ(k)=H(zk)is convex (concave), we haveH(zk+1)-H(zk)⩾H(zk)-H(zk-1)(⩽).Therefore,F‾Z(t)⩾F‾Tk(t)(⩽) for all t, i.e.Z⩾stTk(≤st). Beingψincreasing, it follows12E(ψ(Tk-1))+12E(ψ(Tk+1))=E(ψ(Z))⩾E(ψ(Tk))(⩽).Thenη(k)is convex (concave).□Now we can obtain the following result.Proposition 3.2If k is chosen randomly according to two different random variablesK1andK2with supports included in{0,1,…,m}andφ(k)=H(zk)is convex (concave) in{0,1,…,m}for allu,v∈(0,1), then:(i)K1≤cxK2impliesTK1≤stTK2(⩾st).X≥stYandK1≤icxK2(≤icv) implyTK1≤stTK2.(i)Ifφ(k)=H(zk)is convex, then, from Lemma 3.1,η(k)=E(ψ(Tk))is convex for any increasing functionψ. Therefore, from the definition of the convex order,K1≤cxK2implies(3.2)E(ψ(TK1))=E(η(K1))⩽E(η(K2))=E(ψ(TK1))for any increasing functionψ, that is,TK1≤stTK2. Ifφ(k)is concave, then-φ(k)is convex and with a similar reasoning we obtainTK1⩾stTK2.Ifφ(k)=H(zk)is convex (concave), then, from Lemma 3.1,η(k)=E(ψ(Tk))is convex (concave) for any increasing functionψ. Moreover, asX≥stY, from (2.4), we have thatη(k)is increasing. Therefore, from the definition of the increasing convex (concave) order,K1≤icxK2(≤icv) implies relation (3.2) for any increasing functionψ, that is,TK1≤stTK2.Note that in (i) we do not need the conditionX⩾stY. So, the property holds even ifX≤stYor if X and Y are not ordered. IfX⩾stY, then in (ii), we need the convexity (concavity) ofφ(k)=H(zk)just foru⩾v. In the case of a series system with independent components, we haveφ(k)=H(zk)=ukvm-k,which is a convex function for allu,v∈(0,1). Thus, from (ii), we obtain Theorem 1 in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011). Analogously, from (i), we obtain thatK1≤cxK2impliesTK1≤stTK2even without the conditionX⩾stY. In the case of an arbitrary series system, the function H is equal to the survival copula S of the joint distribution of the component lifetimes. Henceφ(k)is convex if and only ifφ(k+1)-φ(k)⩽φ(k)-φ(k-1)holds, that is, if and only ifS(zk+1)-2S(zk)+S(zk-1)⩾0holds. If S is exchangeable andu⩽v, then the left-hand-side of the preceding expression is equal toP(U1⩽u,…,Uk-1⩽u,u<Uk⩽v,u<Uk+1⩽v,Uk+2⩽v,…,Um⩽v),where(U1,…,Um)is a random vector with distribution function equal to the survival copula S. Analogously, if S is exchangeable andu⩾v, then it is equal toP(U1⩽u,…,Uk-1⩽u,v<Uk⩽u,v<Uk+1⩽u,Uk+2⩽v,…,Um⩽v).Hence, in any case, if S is exchangeable, thenφ(k)is convex for any series system (with this dependence model). Thus, from (ii) in the preceding proposition, we obtain that Theorem 1 in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011) can be applied to series systems with dependent components having an arbitrary exchangeable survival copula S. Analogously, from (i), we obtain thatK1≤cxK2impliesTK1≤stTK2even without the conditionX⩾stY. In the case of a parallel system with independent components, we haveφ(k)=H(zk)=1-(1-u)k(1-v)m-kwhich is a concave function for allu,v∈(0,1). Thus, from (ii) we obtain Theorem 2 in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011). Analogously, from (i), we obtain thatK1≤cxK2impliesTK1⩾stTK2even without the conditionX⩾stY. The same happens for parallel systems with dependent components having an exchangeable survival (or distribution) copula.Next our aim is to obtain similar results for the stronger hazard rate, reverse hazard rate and likelihood ratio orders. The next one deals with the hazard rate order.Proposition 3.3LetX⩾hrY, with X and Y absolutely continuous. If for a fixedk∈{0,1,…,m-1}it holds that(3.3)uiDiH(u1,…,um)H(u1,…,um)isdecreasinginuk+1,for alli=1,2,…,mand for allu1,…,um∈(0,1), then(3.4)Tk≤hrTk+1,whereTi=ϕ(X1,…,Xi,Yi+1,…,Ym),i=k,k+1.From (2.3) we have that the reliability function of the system with lifetimeTkcan be expressed as(3.5)F‾Tk(t)=H(zk(t)),t>0,where(3.6)zk(t)=F‾X(t),…,F‾X(t)︸k-times,F‾Y(t),…,F‾Y(t)︸(m-k)-times.Then its density function isfTk(t)=fX(t)∑i=1kDiH(zk(t))+fY(t)∑i=k+1mDiH(zk(t)),wherefX(t)=-F‾X′(t)andfY(t)=-F‾Y′(t). Hence, its hazard rate can be written asλTk(t)=λX(t)∑i=1kF‾X(t)DiH(zk(t))H(zk(t))+λY(t)∑i=k+1mF‾Y(t)DiH(zk(t))H(zk(t)),whereλX(t)=fX(t)/F‾X(t)andλY(t)=fY(t)/F‾Y(t)are the component hazard rate functions. The hazard rateλTk+1(t)ofTk+1has a similar representation. Therefore,λTk(t)-λTk+1(t)=λX(t)∑i=1kF‾X(t)DiH(zk(t))H(zk(t))-DiH(zk+1(t))H(zk+1(t))+λY(t)F‾Y(t)Dk+1H(zk(t))H(zk(t))-λX(t)F‾X(t)Dk+1H(zk+1(t))H(zk+1(t))+λY(t)∑i=k+2mF‾Y(t)DiH(zk(t))H(zk(t))-DiH(zk+1(t))H(zk+1(t)).Now noting thatX⩾hrYimpliesF‾X(t)⩾F‾Y(t)for all t, and recalling (3.3) and (3.6), we haveF‾Y(t)Dk+1H(zk(t))H(zk(t))⩾F‾X(t)Dk+1H(zk+1(t))H(zk+1(t))andDiH(zk(t))H(zk(t))⩾DiH(zk+1(t))H(zk+1(t))for alli=1,2,…,m,i≠k+1. Then, sinceλY(t)⩾λX(t)by assumption, and H is increasing, we haveλY(t)F‾Y(t)Dk+1H(zk(t))H(zk(t))⩾λX(t)F‾X(t)Dk+1H(zk+1(t))H(zk+1(t)).HenceλTk(t)-λTk+1(t)⩾0for allt⩾0, that is, (3.4) holds.□In the following proposition we obtain a result similar to that given in Proposition 3.1 for the hazard rate order.Proposition 3.4LetX⩾hrY, with X and Y absolutely continuous. If k is chosen randomly according to two different random variablesK1andK2with supports included in{0,1,…,m},K1≤hrK2and the condition(3.7)uiDiH(u1,…,um)H(u1,…,um)isdecreasinginuj,holds for alli,j=1,2,…,mand for allu1,…,um∈(0,1), thenTK1≤hrTK2.The proof is obtained from (2.5), Proposition 3.3 and Theorem 1.B.14 in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007). In Example 5.1 we provide a simple sufficient condition for (3.7) in the special case of series systems and Archimedean copulas. In particular, for series systems with independent components we haveH(u1,…,um)=u1…umanduiDiH(u1,…,um)H(u1,…,um)=1.Hence (3.7) holds for alli,j=1,2,…,mand for allu1,…,um∈(0,1)and thus we obtain Theorem 2 in Hazra and Nanda (2014).Let us now perform suitable comparisons involving the reversed hazard rate order. We proceed similarly as above, but working with the cumulative distribution functions instead of working with the reliability functions. The proof of the following statement is similar to that of Proposition 3.3 and thus it is omitted.Proposition 3.5LetX⩾rhrY, with X and Y absolutely continuous. If for a fixedk∈{0,1,…,m-1}it holds that(3.8)uiDiH∼(u1,…,um)H∼(u1,…,um)isdecreasinginuk+1for alli=1,2,…,mand for allu1,…,um∈(0,1), then(3.9)Tk≤rhrTk+1,whereTi=ϕ(X1,…,Xi,Yi+1,…,Ym),i=k,k+1.The analogous result when k is random can be stated as follows.Proposition 3.6LetX⩾rhrY, with X and Y absolutely continuous. Assume that k is chosen randomly according to two different random variablesK1andK2with supports included in{0,1,…,m}. IfK1≤rhrK2and the condition(3.10)uiDiH∼(u1,…,um)H∼(u1,…,um)isdecreasinginuj,holds for alli,j=1,2,…,mand for allu1,…,um∈(0,1), thenTK1≤rhrTK2.The proof is obtained from Eq. (2.6), Proposition 3.5, assumptionK1≤rhrK2and Theorem 1.B.52 in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007).In particular, for parallel systems with independent components, we haveH∼(u1,…,um)=u1…umanduiDiH∼(u1,…,um)H∼(u1,…,um)=1.Hence (3.10) holds for alli,j=1,2,…,mand for allu1,…,um∈(0,1)and thus we obtain Theorem 3.2 in Hazra and Nanda (2014).We pinpoint that the system comparisons given in Propositions 3.3 and 3.4 can be obtained also under different assumptions. This is shown below, where hazard rate orderings are established under new conditions which do not involve partial derivatives.Proposition 3.7For a fixedk∈{0,1,…,m-1}, let us consider the function(3.11)gk(u,v)≔H(zk)H(zk+1),wherezjis defined by(3.1)forj=k,k+1and foru,v∈(0,1). Let us assume thatgkcan be expressed as(3.12)gk(u,v)=ψk(u,v/u)forallu,v∈(0,1),whereψk:(0,1)2→(0,∞)is increasing in each of its arguments. Then, ifX⩾hrY, we haveTk≤hrTk+1,whereTj=ϕ(X1,…,Xj,Yj+1,…,Ym),j=k,k+1.Letφk:(0,∞)→(0,1)2be defined asφk(t)=(F‾X(t),F‾Y(t)/F‾X(t)). Recall that the reliability functionsF‾X(t)andF‾Y(t)are decreasing. Moreover, the assumptionX⩾hrYimplies thatF‾Y(t)/F‾X(t)is decreasing for allt⩾0, and thatX⩾stY, i.e.F‾Y(t)/F‾X(t)⩽1for allt⩾0. Thus, the functionφk(t)is decreasing in t. Hence, sinceψkis increasing in each of its arguments, the compositionψk∘φkis decreasing in t, i.e., the function in (3.11) is decreasing int⩾0. Due to (3.5) and (3.6) this monotonicity is equivalent toTk≤hrTk+1.□Let us obtain now a similar comparison result when the size k of the first classCXis random.Proposition 3.8LetK1andK2be random variables with supports included in{0,1,…,m}and such thatK1≤hrK2. If for allk∈{0,1,…,m-1}the functions(3.11)can be expressed as in(3.12), whereψk:(0,1)2→(0,∞)is increasing in each of its arguments, and ifX⩾hrY, thenTK1≤hrTK2.The proof of Proposition 3.8 is immediately obtained from Eq. (2.5), Proposition 3.7 and Theorem 1.B.14 in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007). Hereafter we come to similar comparison results involving the reversed hazard rate order.Proposition 3.9For a fixedk∈{0,1,…,m-1}, we consider the function(3.13)hk(u,v)≔H∼(zk)H∼(zk+1),wherezjis defined by(3.1)forj=k,k+1and foru,v∈(0,1). Let us assume thathkcan be expressed as(3.14)hk(u,v)=ζk(v,u/v)forallu,v∈(0,1),whereζk:(0,1)2→(0,∞)is decreasing in each of its arguments. Then, ifX⩾rhrY, we haveTk≤rhrTk+1,whereTj=ϕ(X1,…,Xj,Yj+1,…,Ym),j=k,k+1.LetK1andK2be random variables with supports included in{0,1,…,m}and such thatK1≤rhrK2. If for allk∈{0,1,…,m-1}the functions(3.13)can be expressed as in(3.14), whereζk:(0,1)2→(0,∞)is increasing in each of its arguments, and ifX⩾rhrYthenTK1≤rhrTK2.The proofs of Propositions 3.9 and 3.10 are similar to those of Propositions 3.7 and 3.8, and thus they are omitted. Let us now consider the case of comparisons based on the likelihood ratio order.Proposition 3.11For a fixedk∈{0,1,…,m-1}, we consider the function(3.15)ρk(u,v,w)≔∑i=1kDiH(zk)+w∑i=k+1mDiH(zk)∑i=1k+1DiH(zk+1)+w∑i=k+2mDiH(zk+1),wherezjis defined by(3.1)forj=k,k+1and whereu,v∈(0,1)andw∈(0,∞). Let us assume thatρkcan be expressed as(3.16)ρk(u,v,w)=ξk(u,v/u,w)forallu,v∈(0,1)andallw∈(0,∞),whereξk:(0,1)2×(0,∞)→(0,∞)is increasing in each of its arguments. Then, ifX⩾lrY, we haveTk≤lrTk+1,whereTj=ϕ(X1,…,Xj,Yj+1,…,Ym),j=k,k+1.As the reliability function ofTkis given in (2.3), then its probability density function isfTk(t)=fX(t)∑i=1kDiH(zk(t))+fY(t)∑i=k+1mDiH(zk(t)),t⩾0,wherezk(t)is defined in (3.6). Hence, due to (3.15), the orderingTk≤lrTk+1is equivalent to the condition that the function(3.17)fTk(t)fTk+1(t)=∑i=1kDiH(zk(t))+[fY(t)/fX(t)]∑i=k+1mDiH(zk(t))∑i=1k+1DiH(zk+1(t))+[fY(t)/fX(t)]∑i=k+2mDiH(zk+1(t))is decreasing in t. Consider now a functionφk:(0,∞)→(0,1)2×(0,∞)defined asφk(t)=(F‾X(t),F‾Y(t)/F‾X(t),fY(t)/fX(t)). Recall that the reliability functionsF‾X(t)andF‾Y(t)are decreasing in t. Furthermore,X⩾lrYmeans thatfY(t)/fX(t)is decreasing in t. In addition,X⩾lrYimpliesX⩾hrYand henceF‾Y(t)/F‾X(t)is decreasing in t. Moreover,X⩾lrYimpliesX⩾stYand henceF‾Y(t)/F‾X(t)⩽1. Thusφk(t)is decreasing int⩾0. Therefore, due to (3.16) and sinceξkis increasing in each of its arguments by assumption, then the function in (3.17), which can be written as the compositionξk∘φk(t), is decreasing in t and thusTk≤lrTk+1holds. □The following result is analogous to Proposition 3.8.Proposition 3.12LetK1andK2be random variables with supports included in{0,1,…,m}and such thatK1≤lrK2. If for allk∈{0,1,…,m-1}the functions(3.15)can be expressed as in(3.16), whereξk:(0,1)2×(0,∞)→(0,∞)is increasing in each of its arguments, and ifX⩾lrY, with X and Y absolutely continuous, thenTK1≤lrTK2.The proof of Proposition 3.12 can be obtained from Proposition 3.11 and Theorem 1.C.17 in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007).Various examples related to the above results are discussed in Section 5.For the coherent systems with two classes of components introduced in Section 2, hereafter we investigate the case when the m components are chosen at each position via independent Bernoulli trials with possibly varying probabilities. Thus we consider the two coherent systems with lifetimes(4.1)Tp=ϕ(Zp1,…,Zpm)andTq=ϕ(Zq1,…,Zqm),wherep=(p1,…,pm)andq=(q1,…,qm)forpi,qi∈[0,1]. Here we assume that(Zp1,…,Zpm)and(Zq1,…,Zqm)have the same copula. Given the reliability functionsF‾X(t)andF‾Y(t), we also assume that the outcome of the ith trial establishes whether the ith system component follows the distribution of X or Y. Hence, the marginal reliability functions ofZpiandZqiare given respectively by the following mixtures:(4.2)P(Zpi>t)=piF‾X(t)+(1-pi)F‾Y(t),P(Zqi>t)=qiF‾X(t)+(1-qi)F‾Y(t),fort∈Rand fori=1,2,…,m. Let us assumeX⩾stY. Of course, ifpi⩾qifori=1,2,…,m, then the systems with lifetimes (4.1) satisfyTp⩾stTq(since H is increasing). It should be noted that we are dealing with two systems whose structures are identical whereas their components are possibly different, as their nature depends on the outcome of the Bernoulli trials. Hence, since(Zp1,…,Zpm)and(Zq1,…,Zqm)have the same copula, the two systems have the same domination function H. We also recall that the copula of the system does not depend on the inserted components, but it relies on the common environment.In order to state a more general result for the usual stochastic order, we first need to recall the following two well-known majorization orders (see, e.g., Marshall, Olkin, & Arnold (2011, p. 12)). Letx,y∈Rmbe real vectors, and letx(1)⩽…⩽x(m)andy(1)⩽…⩽y(m)be the ordered values obtained fromxandy, respectively; then(i)xis said to be weakly submajorized byy, denoted asx≤wy, if∑i=jmx(i)⩽∑i=jmy(i)forj=1,2,…,m;xis said to be weakly supermajorized byy, denoted asx⩽wy, if∑i=1jx(i)⩾∑i=1jy(i)forj=1,2,…,m.Note that these two orders are equivalent whenever(4.3)∑i=1mxi=∑i=1myi.So,xis said to be majorized byy, denoted asx⪯y, if conditions (4.3) andx≤wyhold.We will also need the concept of Schur-convexity (Schur-concavity) defined as follows. A functionH:Rm→Ris Schur-convex (Schur-concave) inDifH(x)⩽H(y)(⩾)forallx⪯y,withx,y∈D⊂Rm.Now we can state the following preliminary result.Proposition 4.1Let us consider two coherent systems with the same structure and respective lifetimesϕ(X1,…,Xm)andϕ(Y1,…,Ym), where(X1,…,Xm)and(Y1,…,Ym)have the same copula and have marginal reliability functionsF‾i(t)andG‾i(t), respectively, fori=1,2,…,m. If the common domination function H is Schur-convex (Schur-concave) in(0,1)mand(4.4)F‾1(t),…,F‾m(t)≤wG‾1(t),…,G‾m(t)(⩽w)for all t, thenTX≤stTY(⩾st).The proof can be obtained from Theorem A.8 in Marshall et al. (2011, p. 87).Durante and Sempi (2003) (see also Nelsen (2006, p. 134)), proved that every Archimedean copula is Schur-concave. So the preceding proposition can be applied to series systems with dependent components having Archimedean survival copulas since, in this case,H=S.As a consequence of the preceding proposition, we have the following result for coherent systems with components chosen randomly via Bernoulli trials. Again we remark that the systems have the same structure and the components have the same dependence structure (copula), independently on the outcomes of the Bernoulli trials.Proposition 4.2LetTpandTqbe defined as in(4.1). Assume that(Zp1,…,Zpm)and(Zq1,…,Zqm)have the same copula, and thatZpiandZqihave the reliability functions given in(4.2). Let the common domination function H be Schur-convex (Schur-concave) on(0,1)m. IfX⩾stYand(4.5)p≤wq(⩽w),thenTp≤stTq(⩾st).The reliability functions ofZpiandZqiare given in (4.2), fori=1,2,…,m. As assumptionX⩾stYimpliesF‾X(t)⩾F‾Y(t)for all t, then we haveF‾(i)(t)=p(i)F‾X(t)+(1-p(i))F‾Y(t),G‾(i)(t)=q(i)F‾X(t)+(1-q(i))F‾Y(t)for all t, whereF‾(1)(t)⩽…⩽F‾(m)(t)andG‾(1)(t)⩽…⩽G‾(m)(t)are the ordered reliability functions obtained from the reliability functions of(Zp1,…,Zpm)and(Zq1,…,Zqm), respectively, and wherep(1)⩽…⩽p(m)andq(1)⩽…⩽q(m)are the ordered values of(p1,…,pm)and(q1,…,qm), respectively. Hence∑i=jmF‾(i)(t)=∑i=jmp(i)F‾X(t)+∑i=jm(1-p(i))F‾Y(t)and∑i=jmG‾(i)(t)=∑i=jmq(i)F‾X(t)+∑i=jm(1-q(i))F‾Y(t)for all t and forj=1,2,…,m. Therefore, from assumption (4.5), we have∑i=jmF‾(i)(t)⩽∑i=jmG‾(i)(t)forj=1,2,…,m, that is, (4.4) holds. Then, if H is Schur-convex, the stated result is obtained from Proposition 4.1. The proof is similar when H is Schur-concave andp⩽wqholds.□Let us now provide a similar result for the hazard rate order. We first need the following lemma (see, e.g., Proposition 2.3 in Navarro & Rubio (2012)).Lemma 4.1Let X and Y be two random variables with respective reliability functionsF‾XandF‾Yand such thatX⩾hrY. IfZphas reliability functionpF‾X(t)+(1-p)F‾Y(t), with0⩽p⩽1, thenZp1⩾hrZp2for all1⩾p1⩾p2⩾0.Now we can prove the following result.Proposition 4.3LetTpandTqbe defined as in(4.1), where(Zp1,…,Zpm)and(Zq1,…,Zqm)have the same copula, and whereZpiandZqihave reliability functions given in(4.2). LetX⩾hrY, with X and Y absolutely continuous. If(4.6)uiDiH(u1,…,um)H(u1,…,um)isdecreasinginu1,…,umfor all(u1,…,um)∈(0,1)mand for alli=1,2,…,mand(4.7)pi⩽qifor alli=1,2,…,m, thenTp≤hrTq.Let us consider the reliability function of the system with lifetimeTp=ϕ(Zp1,…,Zpm), given byF‾p(t)=H(F‾1(t),…,F‾m(t)),whereF‾i(t)=piF‾X(t)+(1-pi)F‾Y(t),with0⩽pi⩽1,i=1,2,…,m. Its density function isfp(t)=∑i=1mfi(t)DiH(F‾1(t),…,F‾m(t)),wherefi(t)=-F‾i′(t). Hence its hazard rate can be written asλp(t)=∑i=1mλi(t)F‾i(t)DiH(F‾1(t),…,F‾m(t))H(F‾1(t),…,F‾m(t)),whereλi(t)=fi(t)/F‾i(t)is the hazard rate function ofF‾i(t). Analogously, the hazard rate ofTq=ϕ(Zq1,…,Zqm)can be written asλq(t)=∑i=1mηi(t)G‾i(t)DiH(G‾1(t),…,G‾m(t))H(G‾1(t),…,G‾m(t)),whereG‾i(t)=qiF‾X(t)+(1-qi)F‾Y(t),ηi(t)=-G‾i′(t)/G‾i(t)and0⩽qi⩽1,i=1,2,…,m. Now, by using Lemma 4.1 andpi⩽qi, we haveλi(t)⩾ηi(t)andF‾i(t)⩽G‾i(t)for alli=1,2,…,m. Therefore, using that H is increasing and (4.6) is decreasing, we haveλp(t)=∑i=1mλi(t)F‾i(t)DiH(F‾1(t),…,F‾m(t))H(F‾1(t),…,F‾m(t))⩾∑i=1mηi(t)F‾i(t)DiH(F‾1(t),…,F‾m(t))H(F‾1(t),…,F‾m(t))⩾∑i=1mηi(t)G‾i(t)DiH(G‾1(t),…,G‾m(t))H(G‾1(t),…,G‾m(t))=λq(t)for allt⩾0, this giving the proof.□We pinpoint that even though the condition (4.6) used above is quite strong, some cases in which it is satisfied will be shown in Example 5.1.Remark 4.1If H is exchangeable (i.e.H(u1,…,um)=H(uσ(1),…,uσ(m))for every permutationσ), then a simpler proof of Proposition 4.3 can be given. Indeed, letNpandNqbe the number of components of kind X chosen according top=(p1,…,pm)andq=(q1,…,qm), respectively. Hence, such variables can be expressed as sums of independent random variables, i.e.Np=∑i=1mUi,Nq=∑i=1mVi,whereUiandViare Bernoulli random variables with parameterspiandqi,i=1,2,…,m. Assuming thatpi⩽qi, then we haveUi≤hrVi, fori=1,2,…,m. Thus Theorem 1.B.4 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007) yieldsNp≥hrNq, since the Bernoulli variables are IFR. By the symmetry of H, the distribution of the system only depends on the number of components fromCXand not on where are located in the system. Therefore we can put all the components of classCXat the beginning of the system, and considerTi=ϕ(X1,…,Xi,Yi+1,…,Ym), so thatTp=stTNpandTq=stTNq. IfX⩾hrYand if (4.6) holds, then Proposition 3.4 and conditionNp≤hrNqgive the assertionTp≤hrTq. Actually, in this case, the condition (4.7), can be replaced by the weaker conditionp(i)⩽q(i)fori=1,2,…,m.In the following proposition the systems are compared in the reversed hazard rate order. The proof can be given by using arguments similar to that used in the above results.Proposition 4.4LetTpandTqbe defined as in(4.1), where(Zp1,…,Zpm)and(Zq1,…,Zqm)have the same copula, and whereZpiandZqihave reliability functions given in(4.2). LetX⩾rhrY, with X and Y absolutely continuous. If(4.8)uiDiH∼(u1,…,um)H∼(u1,…,um),isdecreasinginu1,…,um,for all(u1,…,um)∈(0,1)mand for alli=1,2,…,mandpi⩽qifor alli=1,2,…,m, thenTp≤rhrTq.In this section some theoretical examples are included to illustrate the application of the results given in the foregoing. These examples show that the different conditions stated in the preceding sections might hold, or not, depending on the system structure and on the dependence between the components. Therefore, in some cases, to increase the number of good components does not necessarily lead to an improvement of the system performance (under different comparison criteria).The first example shows that in the case that the dependence among components is described by Archimedean survival copulas, then the condition (3.7), which can be restated in terms of the generator of the copula, is not always satisfied even considering simple series systems. Moreover this example also illustrated the fact that whenever the components have a negative dependence based on an Archimedean structure, then such dependence plays in favor of condition (3.7). The example also shows that the conditions in Propositions 3.4 and 3.8 might hold for a series system with dependent components.Example 5.1Let us consider a series system with two dependent components having an Archimedean survival copula (2.1) given by(5.1)S(u,v)=W‾W‾-1(u)+W‾-1(v),whereW‾:[0,∞)→[0,1]is a strictly convex reliability function, and whereW‾-1is the inverse ofW‾. Observe that, sinceH=S, then(5.2)uD1H(u,v)H(u,v)=uwW‾-1(u)·wW‾-1(u)+W‾-1(v)W‾W‾-1(u)+W‾-1(v),where w is the probability density function corresponding toW‾. Letb=W‾-1(v)anda=W‾-1(u), i.e.u=W‾(a). Then we can rewrite the ratio above asW‾(a)w(a)·w(a+b)W‾(a+b)≡λW(a+b)λW(a),whereλW=w/W‾is the hazard rate function corresponding to reliability functionW‾. Now, observe that the function (5.2) is decreasing both in u and v if and only ifλW(a+b)/λW(a)is increasing both in a and b. This last condition is satisfied ifλWis increasing and logconvex. Thus, condition (3.7) holds if the hazard rate functionλWcorresponding to the generator of the copula is increasing and logconvex. It is interesting to observe that the increasing hazard rate property of the generator corresponds to a copula with negative dependence (see, for instance, Averous & Dortet-Bernadet (2004)). So that negative dependence plays in favor of this ordering result. For related results, see also Chapter 11 in Jaworski et al. (2010).For instance, consider the series system with two dependent components having the Gumbel–Barnett Archimedean survival copula given by(5.3)S(u,v)=H(u,v)=uvexp(-θlnulnv),u,v∈(0,1),θ∈(0,1],which is obtained from the generatorW‾(u)=exp{(1-eu)/θ}(see copula n. 9 of Table 4.1 in Nelsen (2006, p. 116)). Therefore, in this case, we have(5.4)uD1H(u,v)H(u,v)=1-θlnv,vD2H(u,v)H(u,v)=1-θlnu.Such functions are decreasing both in u and v in(0,1)2and so condition (3.7) holds fori,j=1,2. Notice thatλW(u)=(1/θ)euis increasing and logconvex and so (3.7) holds. Hence, from Proposition 3.3, we haveT0≤hrT1≤hrT2and thus Proposition 3.4 can be applied to this system. Moreover, from (5.3), we haveH(v,v)H(u,v)=vuexp-θlnvulnuvu,H(u,v)H(u,u)=vuexp-θln(u)lnvu.So the functions in (3.11) can be expressed as in (3.12) whenk=0,1, withψ0(x,z)=zexp{-θln(z)ln(xz)},ψ1(x,z)=zexp{-θln(x)ln(z)}.Both such functions are increasing in each of their arguments on(0,1)2, for allθ∈(0,1], and thus the condition in Proposition 3.8 holds. ♢The second example proves that the sufficient condition (3.7) in Proposition 3.4 is not a necessary condition.Example 5.2Consider the series system with component lifetimes having the Clayton Archimedean copulaS(u,v)=u-θ+v-θ-1-1/θ(θ>0),which is obtained from (5.1) by takingW‾(u)=(1+θu)-1/θ(see copula n. 1 of Table 4.1 in Nelsen (2006, p. 116)). The corresponding hazard rate isλW(u)=(1+θu)-1, which is decreasing foru>0. In this case, the condition (3.7) holds if and only ifu-θu-θ+v-θ-1isdecreasinginu,vfor allu,v∈(0,1). However, this function is strictly decreasing inu∈(0,1)and is strictly increasing inv∈(0,1)for allθ>0. Hence the condition (3.7) does not hold. Then, the series system with lifetimes(5.5)T0=min(Y1,Y2),T1=min(X1,Y2),T2=min(X1,X2),having dependent components with a Clayton survival copula and lifetimesX1=stX2andY1=stY2satisfyingX1⩾hrY1are not necessarily hr-ordered. However, when the component lifetimes have exponential distributions with means 2 (in classCX) and 1 (in classCY), respectively, it holdsT0≤hrT1≤hrT2, as shown in Fig. 1, where the hazard rate functions of the system lifetimes in (5.5) are plotted fort∈(0,10). ♢In the next example we consider a parallel system with two independent components in which the condition in Proposition 3.4 does not hold, whereas that in Proposition 3.8 is fulfilled.Example 5.3Let us consider a parallel system with two independent components. Since the domination function isH(u,v)=u+v-uv,we haveuD1H(u,v)H(u,v)=1-vH(u,v)=1-11+(-1+1/v)u,which is increasing on u and decreasing on v in(0,1)2. Then, condition (3.7) does not hold for this system. However, from (5.3), we haveH(v,v)H(u,v)=2-u(v/u)1+(1-u)(v/u)vu,H(u,v)H(u,u)=1+(1-u)(v/u)2-u,and thus, the functions given in (3.11) can be expressed as in (3.12) whenk=0,1, withψ0(x,z)=2-xz1-x+1/z,ψ1(x,z)=1+(1-x)z2-x.Both such functions are increasing in each of their arguments on(0,1)2, and thus the condition in Proposition 3.8 is fulfilled. The hazard rate functions of lifetimes(5.6)T0=max(Y1,Y2),T1=max(X1,Y2),T2=max(X1,X2)can be seen in Fig. 2in the case of components with exponential distribution having means 2 and 1 (in classCXandCY, respectively). Analogously, it can be seen that condition (3.8) holds and hence Proposition 3.6 can be applied to this system, this leading to an analogous result involving the reversed hazard rate order. ♢Next we give a paradoxical example. It confirms that the system lifetimesTk,k=0,1,…,m, are not necessarily hr-ordered (even in the case of independent components). Hence, if a component is improved in the hr sense, then the system performance is not necessarily improved (in the hr-order). This means that a used system with aget>0having k good components might be better (more reliable) than a used system with age t havingk+1good components.Example 5.4Let us consider the system lifetimeT=max(Z1,min(Z2,Z3))with three independent components having lifetimesZ1,Z2,Z3(see Fig. 3), and domination functionH(u1,u2,u3)=u1+u2u3-u1u2u3.Fork=0,1,2,3, we assume that the lifetimes of the first k components belong to classCX, whereas those of the last3-kcomponents belong to classCY, with exponential reliability functionsF‾X(t)=exp(-t),t⩾0, andF‾Y(t)=exp(-2t),t⩾0, respectively. We recall thatTkdenotes the system lifetime when the size ofCXis k, fork=0,1,2,3. The hazard rate functions ofTk, for all k, are plotted in Fig. 4. We have thatT0≤hrTkfork=1,2,3, butT1,T2,T3are not hr-ordered. Hence, improving the components does not improve such systems in the hr order. For instance, the hazard rate of the system with the best components (T3) is better than the system with one of the worse components (T2) fort∈(0,1.1676). However, this ordering is reversed fort∈(1.1676,∞). As a consequence, we have[T3-t|T3>t]≤st[T2-t|T2>t]fort∈(1.1676,∞).Hence, whent∈(0,1.1676)the residual lifetime of the system at age t fork=3is stochastically larger than the same fork=2, whereas whent∈(1.1676,∞)such relation is reversed. This is intuitively in contrast with the orderingT3⩾stT2, which holds due to Proposition 3.1. Finally, note thatT1,T2andT3are asymptotically equivalent, in the sense that all their hazard rates tend to 1 whent→∞, whereas the hazard rate ofT0tends to 2 whent→∞. ♢Next we show an example involving a system different from a series or a parallel system, and in which the conditions stated in (3.3) hold only for some choices of k.Example 5.5Let us consider the system lifetimeT=min(Z1,max(Z2,Z3))with three independent components having lifetimesZ1,Z2,Z3(see Fig. 5). Then, the domination function isH(u1,u2,u3)=u1u2+u1u3-u1u2u3.A straightforward calculation givesuiDiH(u1,u2,u3)H(u1,u2,u3)=1,i=1ui-u2u3u2+u3-u2u3,i=2,3,which are decreasing functions inu1. Hence, condition (3.3) holds fork=0. So, from Proposition 3.3, we haveT0≤hrT1, whereT0=ϕ(Y1,Y2,Y3)andT1=ϕ(X1,Y2,Y3), under the assumptions that variablesXjandYjhave reliability functionsF‾X(t)andF‾Y(t), respectively, and satisfyX⩾hrY. However, it is easy to see that condition (3.3) does not hold fork=1,2. ♢In the next example we show that the conditions stated in Propositions 3.11 and 3.12 for the preservation of the lr order hold for series systems with independent components. It could be stated as a corollary of that propositions.Example 5.6Let us consider a series system with m independent components, so that the domination function isH(u1,…,um)=u1…um.Hence, from (3.15), we haveρk(u,v,w)=kuk-1vm-k+(m-k)wukvm-k-1(k+1)ukvm-k-1+(m-k-1)wuk+1vm-k-2=k(v/u)2+(m-k)w(v/u)(k+1)(v/u)+(m-k-1)w.This function can be expressed as in (3.16), withξk(x,z,w)=kz2+(m-k)wz(k+1)z+(m-k-1)w.Leta=kz2,b=(m-k)w,c=(k+1)zandd=(m-k-1). A straightforward calculation shows that the functionα1(w)=a+bwc+dwis increasing in w ifbc-ad⩾0. Therefore,ξkis increasing in w on(0,∞)for any fixedx,z∈(0,1), beingbc-ad=[(m-k)(k+1)-k(m-k-1)]z2=mz2⩾0.Analogously, it is easy to see that the functionα2(z)=az2+bzcz+dis increasing forz⩾0ifa,b,c,d⩾0, thusξkis increasing inz∈(0,1)for anyx∈(0,1)andw∈(0,∞). Moreover,ξkis clearly increasing in x. Therefore, Proposition 3.11 yields the following ordering for the system lifetimes:Tk≤lrTk+1, fork=0,…,m-1. Moreover, Proposition 3.12 can be applied to this system. ♢In the next example we show that the conditions for the preservation of the lr order might also hold for series systems with two dependent components.Example 5.7Let us consider a series system with 2 dependent components having the Gumbel–Barnett Archimedean survival copula, already studied in Example 5.1. Making use of Eqs. (5.3) and (5.4), from (3.15) whenk=0, we have thatρ0(t)can be expressed as in (3.16), withξ0(x,z,w)=2wz-2wzθlnz1-θlnxw+z-zθlnz1-θlnxexp[-θlnzln(xz)].A direct calculation immediately shows thatξ0(x,z,w)is increasing in w on(0,1)for all(x,z)∈(0,1)2. Moreover, since-(θlnz)/(1-θlnx)is increasing in x and the functionα1(s)=(a+bs)/(c+ds)is increasing in s ifbc-ad⩾0, then, lettinga=b=1,c=w+z,d=z,bc-ad=w⩾0ands=-(θlnz)/(1-θlnx), we have thatξ0(x,z,w)=2wzα1(s)exp[-θlnxln(xz)]is increasing in x on(0,1)for allz∈(0,1)and allw∈(0,∞).Analogously, we haveξ0(x,z,w)=2wα3(z),whereα3(z)=z-azlnzw+z-azlnzexp[-θln(xz)lnz],witha=θ/(1-θlnx)⩾0. Using arguments as above, it can shown thatξ0is increasing in z on(0,1)for any fixedx∈(0,1)andw∈(0,∞).Then, from Proposition 3.11, we getT0=min(Y1,Y2)≤lrT1=min(X1,Y2)wheneverX⩾lrYand the components have a Gumbel–Barnett survival copula.Similarly, whenk=1, (3.16) holds forξ1(x,z,w)=xz(1-θln(xz))exp[-θlnxln(xz)]+wx(1-θlnx)exp[-θlnxln(xz)]2x(1-θlnx)exp[-θlnxln(xz)],that is,ξ1(x,z,w)=w+z-zθlnz1-θlnxexp[-θlnxlnz].Therefore,ξ1is increasing in x and w on(0,1)×(0,∞)for anyz∈(0,1). Moreover,ξ1(x,z,w)=12w+z-azlnzexp(blnz)=wzb+zb+1-azb+1lnz,witha=θ1-θlnx⩾0, andb=-θlnx⩾0. Then∂∂zξ1(x,z,w)=bwzb-1+(b+1)zb-azb-a(b+1)zblnz⩾0forz∈(0,1)since(b+1)-a=(1-θlnx)-θ1-θlnx=(1-θlnx)2-θ1-θlnx⩾0for allθ∈(0,1]. Henceξ1(x,z,w)is increasing in z on(0,1)for any x and w in(0,1)×(0,∞).Then, from Proposition 3.11, we obtain thatT1=min(X1,Y2)≤lrT2=min(X1,X2)wheneverX⩾lrYand the components have a Gumbel–Barnett survival copula. Hence, also Proposition 3.12 can be applied, i.e., givenK1andK2with support{0,1,2}and such thatK1≤lrK2, ifX⩾lrYthenTK1≤lrTK2. ♢The last example describes an application of Proposition 4.1. Other applications are given in the following section.Example 5.8Let us consider two series systems, each one formed by 3 dependent components having lifetimes whose dependence is described by a Clayton Archimedean survival copula (see, e.g., Nelsen (2006, p. 152)). Thus the domination function isH(u,v,w)=u-θ+v-θ+w-θ-2-1/θ,withθ>0. LetF‾iandG‾i,i=1,2,3, denote the marginal reliability functions of the lifetimes of the components of the first and the second system, respectively. As stated in Section 4, H is Schur-concave since it is Archimedean, and Proposition 4.1 can be applied, proving that if(5.7)(F‾1(t),F‾2(t),F‾3(t))⩾w(G‾1(t),G‾2(t),G‾3(t))thenT1≤stT2.For example, if the components in the two series systems have exponential distributions with means 1, 2, 3 and 4/3, 4/3, 3, respectively. Then(e-t,e-t/2,e-t/3)⩾w(e-3t/4,e-3t/4,e-t/3)forallt⩾0,beinge-t/3⩾e-t/3,e-t/2+e-t/3⩾e-3t/4+e-t/3,ande-t+e-t/2+e-t/3⩾e-3t/4+e-3t/4+e-t/3for allt⩾0. Note that the last inequality is equivalent toe-t+e-t/2-2e-3t/4⩾0, which holds becausee-t+e-t/2-2e-3t/4=(e-t/2-e-t/4)2⩾0for all t. Thus, from Proposition 4.1, we haveH(e-t,e-t/2,e-t/3)⩽H(e-3t/4,e-3t/4,e-t/3)for allt⩾0, i.e., the lifetimes of the two systems are comparable in the usual stochastic order. It is interesting to observe that, in particular, lettingF‾1,F‾2,F‾3be any triplet of reliability functions, then(F‾1(t),F‾2(t),F‾3(t))⩾w(G‾(t),G‾(t),G‾(t)),forallt⩾0,whereG‾(t)=(F‾1(t)+F‾2(t)+F‾3(t))/3, and the lifetime of the first system will be smaller, in the usual stochastic order, than the lifetime of the second one. Thus, in this series system and with this common dependence (copula), the homogeneity between components improves the reliability of the system. Hence it is better to choose them randomly at each position in the system. It should be pointed out that the same statement also follows from Theorem 5.4 in Navarro and Spizzichino (2010). ♢In practice, there are several situations in which we have to use different kinds of units to build coherent systems. In such situations, we have to develop optimal procedures for the allocation of the units in the system to get the best coherent system. For example, if we have two kinds of components (in a similar number) to build series systems with two independent components then, surprisingly, a random choice of these components leads to a series system which is always better than the series system obtained by choosing one component from each kind. This is known as the Parrondo’s paradox in the reliability theory, see Di Crescenzo (2007). Similar results were obtained in Di Crescenzo and Pellerey (2011) for series and parallel systems with independent components and in Navarro and Spizzichino (2010) for arbitrary coherent systems with possibly dependent components.The theoretical results obtained in this paper can be used to go further and analyze the optimal allocation of the components in a system when we only have two kinds of components and some are better than the other. Of course, the best systems are always those which include only the best components. However, we shall assume that this option is not possible, maybe simply because we do not know which are the best components, and that we want to use both kinds of components, with a fixed general proportion.In these situations, as we have already mentioned before, random strategies may leed to the best systems. In this paper, two procedures for the selection of the components have been studied. In Section 3, we considered a random choice of the number k of good components in the systems through a discrete random variable K with support included in the set{0,1,…,m}. In Section 4, we considered coherent systems obtained by choosing the component at position i in the system by using a Bernoulli trial with probabilitypi∈[0,1], that is, by using a good component with probabilitypiand a bad component with probability1-pi, fori=1,…,m. In both procedures, we considered both the cases of systems with independent or with dependent components (with a given copula for the dependency model).In this general framework, which is the best strategy? Could the performance be improved by using random strategies? Will the best strategy depend on the system structure and/or on the dependence model between the components? To answer these questions, let us consider first the simple case of a series system with two independent components and let us assume that we have a 50% of good units and a 50% of bad units (the reasoning is similar with other proportions). Then, by using the notation introduced in Section 4, we can consider the series systems with lifetimesT(p1,p2), wherepi∈[0,1]is the probability of a good component at position i, fori=1,2. Here, to maintain the fifty-fifty proportion of good and bad units in the overall, we assumep1+p2=1. If we do not include this assumption, the best option is obviously to takep1=p2=1(i.e. to use only good units). Note thatT(1,0)=stT1represents the lifetime of the series system with a good component and a bad component. Analogously,T(0.5,0.5)represents the lifetime of the series system with components chosen at random in each position (i.e. the system considered in the Parrondo’s paradox). For this system, we haveH(u,v)=uvwhich is a Schur-concave function in(0,1)2. Then, from Proposition 4.2, we have that if(6.1)(p1,p2)⩽w(q1,q2),thenT(p1,p2)⩾stT(q1,q2). Hence, if we assumep1+p2=q1+q2=1, then (6.1) holds if, and only if,min(p1,p2)⩾min(q1,q2).Therefore, the best option isp1=p2=1/2and the worst options areq1=1andq2=0, orq1=0andq2=1(Parrondo’s paradox).If the components are dependent, then we have seen that H is equal to the survival copula S. From Proposition 4.2,p1=p2=1/2is also the best option for series systems of components with dependence determined by a Schur-concave survival copula S, as it is, for example, in the case of Archimedean copulas. However, this is not always the case (see Navarro & Spizzichino, 2010, Example 6.2).Analogously, if we consider a parallel system with two independent components, then the best options arep1=1andp2=0, orp1=0andp2=1, whereas the worst option isq1=q2=1/2. From Proposition 4.2, the same happens if the components in the parallel system are dependent with a Schur-concave distribution copula C. Therefore, in general, the optimal choice will depend on both the system structure and the dependency model.Now let us try to improve the system performance by using the random procedure studied in Section 3. We start again with the simple case of a series system with two independent components. In this procedure the number of good components in the system is determined by a random discrete variable K over the set{0,1,2}. By using the notation introduced in Section 3, the associated system lifetime is represented byTK. Again we shall assume that there are 50% of good and bad units, that is,E(K)=1(the reasoning is similar with other values). Note that the system with a good component and a bad component can now be represented asTK1=stT(1,0)=stT1withP(K1=1)=1. Analogously, the best option with the random procedure studied in Section 4, i.e.T(0.5,0.5), can now be represented asT(0.5,0.5)=stTK2withP(K2=0)=P(K2=2)=1/4andP(K2=1)=1/2. Other reasonable options might beTK3withP(K3=i)=1/3fori=0,1,2orTK4withP(K4=0)=P(K4=2)=1/2. Note thatE(Ki)=1fori=1,2,3,4. Which one is the best option? IsTK2also the best option in this procedure? The answers to these questions can be obtained from Proposition 3.2,(i), and Remark 3.1. A straightforward calculation shows thatK1≤cxK2≤cxK3≤cxK4.Hence, asφ(k)is convex (see Remark 3.1), we haveTK1≤stTK2≤stTK3≤stTK4,that is,K4is the best option. Actually,K4is the best option (the most convex) wheneverE(K)=1. Note again that here we do not need the conditionX≥stY, that is, it is the best option also ifX≤stYor if they are not ordered (for all reliability functionsF‾XandF‾Y). The same happens if the series system has two dependent components with an exchangeable survival copula (see Remark 3.1) but, in this case,T(0.5,0.5)andTK2are not necessarily equal in law. The plots of the respective reliability functions in the case of independent exponential components with means 5 or 1 can be seen in Fig. 6. Of course, the best option (top) corresponds toTK4. The same will happen if the components are not ordered or if they are dependent with an exchangeable survival copula. Note that such conclusion is not surprising because this is what we usually do in the real life. For example, if a remote control has two batteries in series and we have two good batteries and two bad (or different) batteries, we usually put together the good batteries and the bad batteries (we do not mix them).The conclusion is just the opposite when we consider a parallel system with two independent components (or with two dependent components having an exchangeable copula). In this case the best option isTK1, that is, to put a good component jointly with a bad component (put together different components). Thus, for example, if a plane has two engines and it can fly with just one of them, then, if we have two planes, two good engines and two engines not so good as the previous ones, the best option is, of course, put a good and a ‘not so good’ engine in each plane. The same conclusion holds if we just do not know which are the good engines or if the engines lifetimes are dependent with a symmetric dependence model (an exchangeable copula), which is a reasonable assumption in practice. The results included in this paper can be used to analyze other system structures and other dependency models. Moreover, there are also practical situations in which the random numbersKiare comparable in the likelihood ratio order (thus also in the hazard and the reverse hazard orders), as those illustrated in Section 4 in Hazra and Nanda (2014). In these cases all the statements in previous sections dealing with comparisons of systems in the lr, hr and rhr orders can be applied.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Surprisingly some coherent systems are not ordered (in different stochastic senses) when a unit is replaced by a better unit. Also, some systems might be improved if the components are chosen randomly. In this paper we have developed some procedures to compare coherent systems with two kinds of units having a fixed number or a random number of the best units. We also consider the case of systems in which the units are chosen randomly at each position by using independent Bernoulli trials. We consider various assumptions which include different system structures and different dependency between the components (including the independent case) but always assuming that the system structure and dependency model are the same (i.e. only the components are changed). Our results are distribution-free since they hold for any kind of components having stochastically ordered lifetimes (in different senses). The given examples show that the our findings can be applied to several situations. Specific results are obtained for series systems with dependent components having a common Archimedean copula. A practical application on the optimal allocation of components in a system structure is also given to illustrate the theoretical results.
