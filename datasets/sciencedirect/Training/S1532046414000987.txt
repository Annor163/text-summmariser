Improving search over Electronic Health Records using UMLS-based query expansion through random walks

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We built a novel architecture for information retrieval of patient records.Our main module applies Personalised PageRank to a large graph of medical concepts.We evaluated the method over two medical test collections, with competitive results.The technique provides expansion terms that are not directly linked in the graph.Some medical queries benefit greatly from non-taxonomic expansion concepts.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
ObjectiveMost of the information in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is represented in free textual form. Practitioners searching EHRs need to phrase their queries carefully, as the record might use synonyms or other related words. In this paper we show that an automatic query expansion method based on the Unified Medicine Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus improves the results of a robust baseline when searching EHRs.Materials and methodsThe method uses a graph representation of the lexical units, concepts and relations in the UMLS Metathesaurus. It is based on random walks over the graph, which start on the query terms. Random walks are a well-studied discipline in both Web and Knowledge Base datasets.ResultsOur experiments over the TREC Medical Record track show improvements in both the 2011 and 2012 datasets over a strong baseline.DiscussionOur analysis shows that the success of our method is due to the automatic expansion of the query with extra terms, even when they are not directly related in the UMLS Metathesaurus. The terms added in the expansion go beyond simple synonyms, and also add other kinds of topically related terms.ConclusionsExpansion of queries using related terms in the UMLS Metathesaurus beyond synonymy is an effective way to overcome the gap between query and document vocabularies when searching for patient cohorts.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The automatic processing of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers exciting possibilities for applications such as phenotyping and biosurveillance. One of the main obstacles to exploit EHRs arises from the fact that large portions of information are encoded as free text. Thus, techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) are necessary, and this has stimulated a wealth of research in this area. Previous research has studied different problems in this domain, such as acronym and abbreviation resolution in clinical discourse [20], finding cancer staging information in text [14], or mapping references in text into a medical ontology [1]. Recently, the project Khresmoi1http://www.khresmoi.eu/overview/.1has created a large consortium of European Research Centers joining forces to improve medical analysis information and retrieval.However, the datasets used in most of these projects have not been shared with the research community, often due to ethical clearance issues, and this has made the comparison of different methodologies difficult. Some recent initiatives have tried to address the lack of shared EHR testbeds, creating NLP and IR challenges where different systems participate. The most active has been the i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) initiative, funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH).2https://www.i2b2.org/index.html.2This center has organised several challenges since 2006, involving the following NLP tasks: de-identification of reports; classification of smoking status; recognition of obesity and co-morbidities; extraction of medication information; extraction of concepts, assertions and relations; co-reference identification; and temporal relations in EHR.The study of IR over EHR information sources has been even less explored than other NLP-related tasks, due to the need of larger collections and the complexity involved in building evaluation datasets, which include the selection of appropriate queries, the need of relevance judgements, etc. The main contribution to this line of research came with the 2011 and 2012 Medical Records tracks at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC).3http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec20/t20.proceedings.html and http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec21/t21.proceedings-tracks.html#medical.3For the first time, search for cohorts of patients for relevant medical queries was attempted at a large scale (more than 100,000 medical records). The queries were built by targeting a list of research areas that the U.S. Institute of Medicine considered priorities for comparative effectiveness research.4http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2009/ComparativeEffectivenessResearchPriorities.aspx.4The relevance assessment was done by groups of clinicians after pooling documents for each query. The queries included different pathologies and treatments, as well as demographic constraints. These challenges allowed the comparison of different systems over a shared dataset. They attracted the interest of 29 research groups in 2011 and 24 groups in 2012.In this paper we present in detail a random walk approach for IR over EHR, which performs automatic query expansion based on the concepts and relations in the knowledge bases included in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The query expansion method relies on an algorithm based on random walks, known as Personalised PageRank, which is run over a graph representation of the UMLS. The intuition behind our approach is the following: if we initialise the probability distribution of the UMLS graph with the terms identified in the query, the random walk will help identify relevant terms, which can be used to expand the query for improved retrieval. Our approach is flexible with regard to the type of relationship, and a variety of related terms are found with this method. For instance, for the query “Patients with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG)”, terms such as “eye” and “ocular” are selected by the system for expansion, leading to improved retrieval performance.This article is partially based on the results obtained in our participation in the TREC Medical Track in 2012, as reported in the TREC working notes [15]. Our participation combined several well-known query expansion techniques with a method based on random walks. In this article we provide a better framing of our proposed algorithm, as well as additional analysis, which allows to separate the contribution of our expansion algorithm from the contributions of the other techniques.The PageRank graph-based random walk algorithm was first introduced by Page et al. [17] as a way to better represent the topology of the WWW in order to improve search. Since then, it has been used for a variety of problems, including the prediction of gene markers for cancer [24]. Personalised PageRank [9] was developed in order to represent the importance of a particular query when initialising the probability distribution, and it has been successfully used in NLP tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) [5,4,6,21] and word similarity [19,2,3]. It has been applied both to a general purpose lexical knowledge-bases such as WordNet [2,3,5,4] and also to the UMLS [6,21]. In addition, recent results show that it is useful to improve ad hoc IR with WordNet [16]. In this work, we introduce a method to apply Personalised PageRank over the UMLS to the EHR retrieval tasks of TREC 2011 and 2012. We first present a baseline system, which achieved strong results in the competition in both years, and then show that our query expansion technique yields improvements over the baseline on both datasets.
