This study develops the hybrid models of dynamic multidimensional efficiency classification. By integrating data envelopment analysis (DEA), naïve Bayesian networks (NBN) and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN), this work proposes a five-step design for efficiency classification: (1) performance evaluation with DEA model, (2) efficiency discretization, (3) intra-period classification by NBN, (4) inter-period classification by DBN, (5) testing and validation. Due to the Markovian property of the dynamic models, the inter-period dependency is assumed invariant over time. In data-driven parameter learning, the fuzzy parameters for incorporating the variation in dynamic dependencies are introduced. We conduct an empirical case study of higher education in Taiwan to demonstrate the usability of this design.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Every organization has its peculiar missions that usually comprise various dimensions and evolve over time. From the standpoint of evaluation, an organization needs to be observed from compound perspectives and over a period of time. Non-profit organizations, in contrast with profit business, emphasize specific missions which supersede profitability. For example, research institutions aim at research and development (R&D) activities and achievements. On the other hand, the financial function plays a key role in their survival, therefore operational as well as financial performance must be considered in research institutions. Moreover, endogenous as well as exogenous factors related to organizations are constantly changing, and thus, how to diagnose the inefficiency or predict the trends in dynamic environments becomes inevitable.This study develops the hybrid models of dynamic multidimensional efficiency classification. By integrating data envelopment analysis (DEA), naïve Bayesian networks (NBN) and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN), this work proposes a five-step design for efficiency classification including (1) performance evaluation with DEA model, (2) efficiency discretization, (3) intra-period classification by NBN, (4) inter-period classification by DBN, (5) testing and validation. In training the dynamic models with the Markovian property, a temporal dependency is assumed invariant over time. However, in data-driven parameter learning, it is difficult to identify the stationary temporal relationships in DBN. So, fuzzy parameters for incorporating the variations in dynamic dependencies are introduced. To demonstrate the usability of this design, we have conducted an empirical case study of higher education in Taiwan.In the remainder of this article, we review the essential background in Section 2. In Section 3, the methods and research procedures are addressed. In Section 4, we conduct a case study of higher education in Taiwan. Finally, the concluding remarks are given in Section 5.In this section we briefly review the background of data envelopment analysis, Bayesian networks, and fuzzy sets and theory.Data envelopment analysis (DEA) [1,2] is a celebrated efficiency evaluation technique, among which the BCC model (denominated from the inventors, Banker, Charnes and Cooper) [1], has been widely used. The BCC model assesses the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) by extending the constant-returns-to-scale CCR model (denominated from the inventors, Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes) [2] to variable returns to scale. Consider n DMUs (j=1,…,n) under assessment. Each DMU consumes m inputs (i=1,…,m) and produces s outputs (r=1,…,s), denoted by X1j, X2j, …, Xmjand Y1j, Y2j, …, Ysjrespectively. The efficiency of DMUkcan be computed by the BCC model as follows:BCC ratio model(1)MaxEk=∑r=1surYrk−u0∑i=1mviXiksubject to(s.t.)∑r=1surYrj−u0∑i=1mviXij≤1,j=1,2,…,nur,vi≥εr=1,2,…,s;i=1,2,…,m;u0unrestricted in signIn the BCC ratio model, the objective function Ekis maximized for every DMUkindividually. In the model, Xikand Yrkare the ith input and rth output of DMUk; ur, viare the weights of the outputs and inputs, respectively; ɛ is a small positive value which ensures all weights are non-negative. When the intercept of the production function u0>0 occurs, the efficiency frontier presents decreasing returns to scale; if u0<0, it manifests increasing returns to scale; while if u0=0, the models turn out to be constant-returns-to-scale CCR models. For computational convenience, the ratio model is normally transformed into a linear programming (LP) model by assuming∑i=1mviXik=1[2]. Notably, the solution space of the DEA LP model is smaller than that of the ratio model due to the constraint∑i=1mviXik=1. Thus, the LP model only finds the local optimum for the ratio model which comprises fractional terms [3].Bayesian networks (BN) [4–7] may be described by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which the nodes represent the variables, the arcs represent the directed causal influences between the linked variables, and the influences may be described by conditional probabilities. They are widely used knowledge representation and reasoning models for various domains under uncertainty. Because an expert system requires both predictive and diagnostic information, two types of reasoning are common in Bayesian networks, deduction and abduction. Deduction, or prediction, is a logical process from a hypothesis to deduce evidence where probabilistic relationships are involved. Abduction, or diagnosis, is a logical process that hypothetically explains experimental observations [7]. The naïve Bayesian network (NBN) model was named by Titterington et al. [8] for its simplicity. In a NBN model, the variable of interest has to be a root without a parent node.If a Bayesian network does not involve any temporal factors, it is a static network. Static Bayesian networks can be extended into dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) by introducing relevant temporal dependencies between representations of the static network at different times [9–12]. Two types of dependencies can be distinguished in a dynamic network: contemporaneous dependencies and non-contemporaneous dependencies [9]. Contemporaneous dependencies refer to arcs between nodes that represent variables within the same time period. Non-contemporaneous dependencies refer to arcs between nodes that represent variables at different times.Most previous studies on Bayesian networks use probability distributions associated with the random variables (nodes) as the numerical models. Before modeling the Bayesian network, we identify the sources of uncertainty that may exist in reasoning systems. The sources of uncertainty can be classified as (a) stochastic properties of the system, which manifest with random behaviors of the variables; (b) incomplete knowledge, accompanied with personal or subjective judgments; (c) semantic vagueness in system features, such as high manufacturing capability, good stock control performance, fair customer satisfaction, and so on. Taking different sources of uncertainty into account, probabilistic approach may be computationally intractable in the context of uncertainties (b) and (c). For example, it is difficult to describe the causal links by pure probability theory when semantic vagueness is involved. Also in a highly uncertain system with incomplete knowledge, it will be hard to estimate the probability parameters and subjective knowledge may be unavoidable. Freeling [13] claimed that fuzzy probability can be developed as an extension of probability theory, which is more promising than possibility and probability theory as the uncertainty measure. By fuzzy probabilities, the numerical models for Bayesian networks can be extended and more adaptive to various reasoning context. This study intends to incorporate the concept of possibility [14–16] and construct fuzzy parameters in Bayesian networks.Reviewing the graphical decision model with a possibility approach, Yamada [17] addresses uncertain reasoning with multiple causes and conditional possibilities on a causal network model, which focuses on the causal effect in two layered networks. Rodríguez-Muñiz et al. [18] explore the statistical rules for modeling fuzzy random variables and utilities in influence diagrams mainly based on the value-preserving transformations. Later, López-Díaz and Rodríguez-Muñiz [19] analyze how to evaluate influence diagrams with multiple value nodes in terms of fuzzy random variables by dynamic programming. These works emphasize utility evaluation and ignore diagnostic reasoning.Additionally, studies on fuzzy probabilities and parameters as an alternative approach in fuzzy logic framework are developed. Zadeh [20,21] constructs the generalized theory of uncertainty (GTU) and include fuzzy probability as one building block of the fuzzy logic. Li and Kao [22] use fuzzy parameters to formulate the soft constraints in learning average causal effects from imperfect experiments. Later the multiple-objective nonlinear programming models are developed to solve constrained diagnostic reasoning and decision problems [23,24]. Shipley and Johnson [25] propose a fuzzy sets-based selection of employees in order to meet the projects’ goals for the preferred cognitive style. They design an algorithm based on belief in the fuzzy probability of a cognitive style fitting a defined goal. Abdelaziz and Masri [26] introduce a multistage stochastic program with triangular fuzzy probability distributions. In their study, the α-cut method is used as the de-fuzzification technique for the mini-max approach in decomposing the stochastic program. Later in Section 3, we will learn the fuzzy parameters for the dynamic Bayesian Networks in the inter-period classification.This section presents the approaches for efficiency estimation and classification. In the proposed framework, the factors and efficiency outcomes from DEA are integrated with the hybrid models in learning the patterns of DMUs’ performance. The research procedure and the integrated models of this study are depicted as Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.Assume that n DMUs are evaluated from two perspectives, Efficiency 1(Ek1t)and Efficiency 2(Ek2t)for DMU k (k=1,…,n), at time t (t=1,…,p). In Fig. 2, the models are composed of the intra-period classification NBNs and inter-period classification DBNs. The DBNs indicate the temporal dependency between two types of efficiencies in adjacent periods, while the NBNs express the interrelation between the efficiency score and the associated input/output factors in one period. The research procedure is described as follows.Step 1: Efficiency scoring by DEABased on the BCC model in (1), this study first evaluates various efficiencies of all DMUs. Concerning efficiency a, every DMU consumes mainputs (i=1,…,ma) and produces saoutputs (r=1,…,sa), respectively. The efficiencyEkatof DMUk, a=1, 2, t=1,…,p, k=1,…,n, can be computed as in (2).(2)MaxEkat=∑r=1sauratYrkat−u0at∑i=1maviatXikats.t.∑i=1maviatXikat=1∑r=1sauratYrjat−u0at∑i=1maviatXijat≤1,j=1,2,…,na=1,2;t=1,2,…,purat,viat≥εr=1,2,…,sa;i=1,2,…,mau0atunrestricted in signIn the above model, the objective functionEkatis maximized for every DMUkat time t, individually. In the model, Xikaand Yrkaare the ith input and rth output for measuring efficiency a of DMUk;urat,viatare the weights of the outputs and inputs for measuring efficiency a at time t, respectively; ɛ is a small positive value which ensures that all weights are non-negative;u0atdenotes the intercept of production function.Step 2: Efficiency discretization by tier extractionIn the previous step, the model (2) determines one efficient group(Ekat=1)and the other sub-efficient group(Ekat<1)of DMUs. This study uses the tier extraction [27] to iteratively assign DMUs to the efficiency frontiers they belong to. The algorithm is described as follows.S1:Set i=1. Set SC={all DMUs}S2:Compute the efficiency scores of DMUs in SC.S3:Store the efficient DMUs with score 1 in Tier(i). Remove the efficient DMUs from SC.S4:Determine if the extraction process continues. If yes set i=i+1, go to S2;else set tMax=i, go to S5.S5:For i=1 to tMaxOutput DMUs in Tier(i).End.The procedure is demonstrated in Fig. 3. Each DMU will belong to a corresponding tier thereafter.Step 3: Intra-period classification by NBNFor the efficiency measure, we aim to construct the knowledge base of the static relationship between the input/output factors and the efficiency in one single period. As with the NBNs in Fig. 2, the prior distributions to be learned areP(Xik1t|Ek1t),P(Yrk1t|Ek1t),P(Xik2t|Ek2t)andP(Yrk2t|Ek2t),for any a=1, 2, t=1,…,p, k=1,…,n, i=1,…,ma, and r=1,…,sa. This study uses the expectation–maximization technique for finding maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) to estimate the parameters [7].Step 4: Inter-period classification by DBNFollowing Step 2, all DMUs are assigned to their corresponding tier from two perspectives. Now we intend to examine the possible dependencies between various efficiencies in adjacent periods. For DMUkassessed withEk1tandEk2t,where k=1, …, n; t=1, …, p, the inter-period modelsP(Ek1t|Ek11,…,Ek2t−1,Ek21,…,Ek2t)andP(Ek2t|Ek21,…,Ek2t−1)need to be learned.In Fig. 2, the Markovian property and invariant inter-period relationships are assumed. That is,P(Ek1t|Ek11,…,Ek2t−1,Ek21,…,Ek2t)=P(Ek1t|Ek1t−1,Ek2t)andP(Ek2t|Ek21,…,Ek2t−1)=P(Ek2t|Ek2t−1),wheret=2,…,p.So the prior and conditional distributions to be learned for the DBNs areP(Ek21),P(Ek11|Ek21),P(Ek2t|Ek2t−1),P(Ek1t|Ek1t−1,Ek2t),wheret=2,…,p.In the data-driven parameter learning process, how to estimate the stationary parameters learned from different time frames is difficult. This study introduces the fuzzy parameters and membership functions to unify the parameters obtained from p−1 periods.First from the data set, the conditional probabilitiesP(Ek2t|Ek2t−1)andP(Ek1t|Ek1t−1,Ek2t)for t=2, …, p are learned. Because the conditional probabilities in different periods are diverse, the techniques of fuzzy statistics are used to construct the fuzzy parameters for unifying the prior information obtained from p−1 periods. In this design, the fuzzy parameterp˜i,is a fuzzy number expressed with a triangular membership functionπ(pi)=(pi_,pi*,pi¯)where(3)π(pi)=(pi_,pi*,pi¯)=pi−p_ipi*−p_i,p_i≤pi≤pi*1,pi=pi*p¯i−pip¯i−pi*,pi*≤pi≤p¯i0,elsewhere.The possibility distribution in (3) is depicted in Fig. 4.As we take the α-cut, there will be two intersection points in[pi_,pi*]and[pi*,pi¯], which we name lvalue and rvalue for the α-cut, respectively.Step 5: Testing and validationIntra-period classification by NBN: This study adopts the k-fold cross-validation analysis. In k-fold cross-validation, the initial data is randomly partitioned into k mutually exclusive subsets or folds D1,D2,…,Dk, each of approximately equal size. Training and testing is performed k times. In iteration i, partition Diis reserved as the test set, and the remaining partitions are used to train the model [28]. The benefit of this method is that all samples are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once.Inter-period classification by DBN: In validating the DBN, this study designs the revised stochastic simulation algorithm for computing posterior probabilities with fuzzy parameters as follows.Revised stochastic simulationfori=1 tosimulation_nodo:R1.Choose the current node Ecurfrom UnknownNodeList. If Ecur=EOF (end of file), then Ecur=the first node in UnknownNodeList and proceed to next iteration.R2.Set α-cut for the distribution π(pi) of every fuzzy parameterp˜i.Take the intersection points, lvalue in[pi_,pi*]and rvalue in[pi*,pi¯]from the α-cut set of π(pi), respectively.R3.ComputeP(Ecur=1|WEcur)P(Ecur=0|WEcur),where Wcuris the conditions of all neighboring nodes (Markov blanket) of Ecurwithout Ecuritself. Assign Ecurthe random number generator favoring 1 by the ratioP(Ecur=1|WEcur)P(Ecur=0|WEcur).R4.If Ecur=1, then count(Ecur)=count(Ecur)+1.R5.Assign Ecurthe next node in UnknownNodeList.End./* of for */Compute BEL(*) the ratio of the target value of every node * in UnknownNodeList. Then check BEL(*) with test data to validate the accuracy of classification.This section addresses the empirical case investigation of higher education in Taiwan. The universities in Taiwan play multiple roles concerning education as well as being research institutions. Due to the recessional birth rate and the retrenchment of government subsidy, higher education in Taiwan faces the toughest financial challenges ever. To survive, they need to maintain R&D and financial competitiveness as well. We sample 45 universities in Taiwan, including 23 national and 22 private universities. The financial and R&D data of every institution has been collected during the period 2007–2010. The R&D and financial factors are listed as follows.Inputs: (a) the number of grants approved, (b) the amount of grants approved, (c) the number of faculty, (d) the number of Ph.D. students, and (e) the number of master students;Outputs: (a) the number of publications in SCI, (b) the number of publications in SSCI, (c) the number of patents-inventions granted, and (d) the number of patents-new granted.Inputs: (a) operating costs/expenses, and (b) other expenses;Outputs: (a) operating revenue, and (b) other revenue.The descriptive statistics are given in Table 1. The procedure of the case study is described as follows.Step 1: Efficiency scoring by DEAWe first evaluate the efficiencies for every university in every year by (2). In accordance with Fig. 2,Ek1tandEk2tdenote the R&D and financial efficiencies for DMUkin period t, respectively.Step 2: Efficiency discretization by tier extractionUsing the tier extraction technique, we convert the efficiency scores into their corresponding efficiency tiers as mentioned in Section 3. The distributions of efficiency scores are summarized in Table 2.Step 3: Intra-period classification by NBNIn this step, we aim to estimate the dependency between the input/output factors and the efficiencies from R&D as well as financial perspectives. Based on Fig. 2, the prior and conditional distributions of the NBNs,P(Xik1t|Ek1t),P(Yrk1t|Ek1t),P(Xik2t|Ek2t)andP(Yrk2t|Ek2t)are learned.Step 4: Inter-period classification by DBNTo examine the temporal dependency between R&D and financial performances, the parameters of the DBN,P(Ek21),P(Ek11|Ek21),P(Ek1t|Ek1t−1,Ek2t),P(Ek2t|Ek2t−1)for t=2,…,p are learned as described in Section 3. Some of these probabilities are triangular fuzzy numbers. Take the binary case for example, the parameters are learned as follow.Non-fuzzy parametersP(Ek21=1)=0.25,P(Ek11=1|Ek21=1)=0.2,P(Ek11=1|Ek21=0)=0.464,Fuzzy parametersP(Ek2t=1|Ek2t−1=1)=(0.5,0.59,0.714),P(Ek2t=1|Ek2t−1=0)=(0.069,0.124,0.161),P(Ek1t=1|Ek1t−1=1,Ek2t=1)=(0.6,0.622,0.667),P(Ek1t=1|Ek1t−1=1,Ek2t=0)=(0.167,0.357,0.571),P(Ek1t=1|Ek1t−1=0,Ek2t=1)=(0.667,0.703,0.727),P(Ek1t=1|Ek1t−1=0,Ek2t=0)=(0.045,0.122,0.261),Step 5: Testing and validationIntra-period classification by NBN: This study randomly and evenly divides the data into four subsets (all subsets with 11 samples but one subset with 12 samples) and adopts the cross-validation analysis as in Tables 3 and 4.In the R&D classification, the accuracy rate diminishes as the number of states increases. In the binary case, the rates lie between 70% and 75% except for fold 3. When the children states change to four-valued, the average accuracy rates are approximately 64%. The expected accuracy drops dramatically to under 40% while all nodes are four-valued.In terms of finance classification, the expected accuracy rate of the binary case is 75.8%. However, the expected accuracy rises to around 84% as the children states change to four-valued ones. This violates the rule of thumb that prediction for summary obtains higher accuracy than that for details. Observing the finance data in Table 2, the proportion of tier 1 is relatively low (approximately 20%) compared to that of R&D data. That means, in the binary case, the finance data is markedly unbalanced, which possibly causes lower classification accuracy than for four-valued cases. Thereafter, the accuracy drops to roughly 40% when all nodes are four-valued. In summary, finance classification obtains higher accuracy compared to R&D classification.Inter-period classification by DBN: Two types of scenarios, diagnosis and prediction are tested.Case 1 (diagnosis)Suppose thatEk14=1(efficient in R&D) andEk24=2(sub-efficient in finance) at t=4 and simulate backwards for 3 periods(Ek11,Ek12,Ek13,Ek21,Ek22,Ek23)in testing. Using the revised stochastic simulation (step 5, Section 3), this study obtains the posterior beliefs with binary states as is shown in Table 5and Figs. 5–7.From Figs. 5–7, using the α-values, the belief distributions reveal triangular patterns, except for Fig. 5(a). Even for Fig. 5(a), it is possible to approximate potential belief functions by appropriate data fitting techniques. With the observationsEk14=1(efficient in R&D) andEk24=2(sub-efficient in finance), the posterior beliefs show that both R&D and financial inefficiency at t=1 were possibly sub-efficient or nearly sub-efficient. Then the belief of efficient R&D function increases and the belief in efficient finance decreases. Financial inefficiency is likely the main reason for the symptoms and some adjusting strategies are needed to improve the situation.Case 2 (prediction):AssumeEk14=2(sub-efficient in R&D) andEk21=1(efficient in finance) at t=1 and reason forward for the future outcomes(Ek12,Ek13,Ek14,Ek22,Ek23,Ek24). Using the revised stochastic simulation (step 5, Section 3), this study obtains the beliefs with binary states as Table 6and Figs. 8–10.From Figs. 8–10, using the α-values, we find that all belief distributions reveal approximately triangular patterns, so it is sensible to construct the triangular membership functions by the corresponding α-values.With the observationsEk11=2(sub-efficient in R&D) andEk21=1(efficient in finance), with a lack of a good R&D function, even the financial performance is currently competent and it is possible that both departments evolve to be inefficient in subsequent periods. So the decision makers need to take proactive actions to prevent unsatisfactory outcomes. For example, the decision maker may combine the intra-period classification and trace the input and output factors to rectify the weak R&D performance.The accuracy rates for different α-values are summarized in Table 7and Figs. 11 and 12. The accuracy rates range between 71% and 78% and between 72% and 84% for diagnosis and prediction, respectively. As α-values increase, the accuracies tend to decrease. So the decision maker will face the trade-off between the cost and confidence of fuzzy information. In short, the accuracy is referable and meaningful from the perspective of management.This study develops the dynamic multidimensional models in efficiency classification by integrating DEA and hybrid Bayesian networks. DEA is widely used in efficiency evaluation because of its capability of handling multiple inputs and outputs, nonparametric properties that do not rely on any assumption of particular distribution, inputs and outputs may have different units, and so on. We conduct intra-period classification using naïve Bayesian networks and inter-period classification using dynamic Bayesian networks. To unify the parameters estimated from different periods, this study introduces the fuzzy parameters for dynamic Bayesian networks and develops the revised stochastic simulation algorithm for reasoning. The case study concerning the R&D and financial efficiencies of the universities in Taiwan is implemented. The posterior results show some interesting patterns that may be useful in decision support and problem diagnosis. The proposed methods provide referable information in dynamic multidimensional settings without neglecting the static dependencies regarding efficiencies.This work comprises the strengths of Bayesian networks, which include being coherent and mathematically sound in handling uncertainty, being robust and adaptive in modeling with data, being intuitive and possessing a compact representation of dependence and independence relations, etc. Various empirical studies of naïve Bayesian classifier in comparison with decision tree and neural network classifiers have found it competitive in some domains [28]. DBN extend the strengths and adapt BN in time-dependent environments. In the areas of education and institutional research, Bayesian networks have been widely used as the knowledge base, for example, the ranking evaluation of institutions by a set of performance indicators [29]. However, comparable works combing DEA, NBN, DBN are rare in related domains. We expect that the proposed framework may be applied to potential domains for efficiency estimation and classification.
