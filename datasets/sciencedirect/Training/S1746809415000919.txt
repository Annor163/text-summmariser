@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The goal of this study was to develop a hybrid mental speller that can effectively prevent unexpected typing errors in the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based mental speller by simultaneously using the information of eye-gaze direction detected by a low-cost webcam without calibration. In the implemented hybrid mental speller, a character corresponding to the strongest SSVEP response was typed only when the position of the selected character coincided with the horizontal eye-gaze direction (‘left’, ‘no direction’, or ‘right’) detected by the webcam-based eye tracker. When the character detected by the SSVEP-based mental speller was located in the direction opposite the eye-gaze direction, the character was not typed at all (a beep sound was generated instead), and thus the users of the speller did not need to correct the mistyped character using a ‘BACKSPACE’ key. To verify the feasibility and usefulness of the developed hybrid mental spelling system, we conducted online experiments with ten healthy participants, each of whom was asked to type 15 English words consisting of a total of 68 characters. As a result, 16.6 typing errors could be prevented on average, demonstrating that the proposed hybrid strategy could effectively enhance the performance of the SSVEP-based mental spelling system.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many individuals suffering from serious neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury have difficulty in communicating with other people or controlling their external environment. Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) are non-muscular communication and interaction technologies that allow these disabled individuals to communicate with the outside world using their brain signals [1]. To date, a variety of neural signals have been used with the aim of implementing practical BCI applications, such as electroencephalography (EEG) [1–13], magnetoencephalography (MEG) [14,15], electrocorticography [16,17], near-infrared spectroscopy [18–20], functional magnetic resonance imaging [21,22], and transcranial Doppler ultrasound [23,24]. In particular, the number of EEG-based BCI applications has increased markedly during the past five years [5].One of the most representative EEG-based BCI applications is the BCI speller, which allows paralyzed users to spell out words by simply gazing at the target characters [25–31]. So far, most mental spelling systems have been developed based on the visual P300, which is an event-related potential (ERP) component induced by irregular, infrequent, and task-relevant visual stimuli [27–30]. N200, a negative ERP component evoked by motion-onset visual stimuli [32,33], and modulation of EEG rhythmic activity due to motor imagery [34] have also been used for implementing mental spelling systems. Since these ERPs have proved to have relatively lower intra- and inter-subject variability compared to the classical motor imagery-based BCI paradigms, ERP-based spellers do not generally require long training time [27–30,32,33]. Recently, some BCI studies have reported the successful implementation of mental spelling systems based on steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), which is a periodic EEG response elicited by a visual stimulus flickering or reversing at a specific frequency [25,31]. The SSVEP-based BCI systems have received increasing attention because they provide a high information transfer rate, require relatively few electrodes, and generally do not require any training, as compared to the requirements of other BCI systems [1,35]. In the SSVEP-based mental spelling systems, the users are supposed to gaze at one of several visual stimuli with different flickering frequencies in order to generate a target command, and the systems can select the target by detecting the changes in EEG spectral power recorded around the visual cortex. SSVEP-based BCI systems have been implemented with different design types such as a moving cursor type [31] and a multi-step decision-tree type [25], both of which needed a series of multiple commands to be generated to spell a character.Recently, our group implemented an SSVEP-based mental spelling system adopting a QWERTY style keyboard layout with 30 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) flickering at different frequencies with a 0.1-Hz inter-frequency span [26]. Because the number of visual stimuli was identical to that of the target characters, users could spell a target character directly in a single trial. Our previous system showed high performance (letters per minute=9.39) in online experiments. However, characters that were located in the direction opposite the users’ gaze were frequently mistyped, because thirty stimulation frequencies were assigned to each key in such a way that each frequency was allocated sequentially as far from those assigned to its neighboring LEDs as possible in order to minimize the false positives caused by peripheral vision. In the cases of the mistyping, the users needed to spend additional time to correct the typing error using a ‘BACKSPACE’ key.The goal of the present study was to enhance the performance of the mental spelling system by preventing predictable typing errors (typos) in advance. To this end, we combined the previous mental speller with a low-cost webcam-based eye tracker that can accurately estimate horizontal eye-gaze directions (‘left’ or ‘right’) without any pre-calibration processes. In order to confirm the feasibility of our hybrid mental spelling system, online experiments were conducted with 10 participants. The basic concept of the proposed error prevention method is similar to that of the error-related potential (ErrP)-based error detection method [36–41]; however, unlike the ErrP-based method, the proposed hybrid mental speller detects typing errors before visualizing the mistyped characters, which will be discussed further in Section 4.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, we introduced a hybrid mental spelling system which prevents additional typing of ‘BACKSPACE’ to correct typos. In order to detect typos, simultaneously utilizes both EEG signals recorded from the occipital area and the horizontal eye-gaze direction information extracted from a low-cost webcam-based eye tracker. In our online experiments conducted with 10 healthy participants, at least 16.6 typos could be prevented, from the results, verifying that the proposed strategy could effectively enhance the performance of the SSVEP-based mental spelling system.
