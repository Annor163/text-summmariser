@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A contrast enhancement of medical images using Type II fuzzy set theory is suggested. Fuzzy set theory considers uncertainty in the form of membership function but to have better information on uncertainty on the membership function, Type II fuzzy set is considered. Type II fuzzy set considers fuzziness in the membership function. Hamacher T co norm is used as an aggregation operator to form a new membership function using the upper and lower membership function of Type II fuzzy set. The image with the new membership function is an enhanced image. As medical images contain lot of uncertainties, Type II fuzzy set may be a good tool for medical image analysis. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results are compared with fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy, and existing Type II fuzzy methods. Experiments on several images show that the proposed Type II fuzzy method performs better than the existing methods. To show the advantage of the proposed enhancement method, detection or extraction of abnormal lesions or blood vessels has been carried out on enhanced images of all the methods. It is observed that the segmented results on the proposed enhanced images are better.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Medical images play a significant role in modern diagnosis. Imaging information always affects the result of diagnosis. When image is captured there is some information loss and this information loss decreases the contrast of the image. Medical images are poorly illuminated; many important structures are not visible properly. So, uncertainties are present in the image which is in the form of imprecise gray levels, vagueness in homogeneity of image segments or vague contrast between object and background and thus it becomes difficult to segment or detect the boundaries of the abnormal structures/lesions or blood vessels present in the image thereby leads to inaccurate diagnosis. So, it is required to increase the contrast of the image. The object of contrast enhancement is to transform an image to another form that is more suitable for further processing. There are many image enhancement methods and the most common method is histogram equalization [22], which is a non-fuzzy method. In this method, the resulting image has a uniform distribution of intensity but it may cause washed out effect after equalization. Many modified techniques are suggested on histogram based contrast enhancement to overcome the limitation and these includes bi histogram equalization [7], histogram specification [1]. These techniques process crisp histograms of images for enhancement. The crisp method has limitation that it does not account the imprecision of gray values. Because of this limitation, dynamic fuzzy histogram equalization with brightness preserving is proposed by Sheet et al. [21] to overcome uncertainty in low contrast images.But as medical images contain uncertainties, fuzzy methods are useful. To deal with such kind of images, many authors suggested mathematical tools that deal with uncertainties. Zadeh [27] introduced the notion of fuzzy set that considers the uncertainty in the form of membership function. It can able to handle the inexactness of gray values. The most common operator is INT operator [14], which is applied globally to modify the membership and increase the contrast of the image. This approach transforms the higher membership values to much higher values or lower membership values to much lower values in a nonlinear manner. But this method solely depends on membership function and is continuously applied on the image till required contrast is obtained. The limitation is improved using NINT operator suggested by Handmandlu [13] that uses Gaussian type fuzzification function. It contains a single fuzzifier and NINT operator. The fuzzifier is obtained by maximizing fuzzy contrast. Histogram hyperbolization proposed by Tizhoosh [23] is also an approach to image enhancement. Hassanein and Badr [12] suggested few fuzzy methods in image enhancement. Cheng [9] proposed an adaptive local fuzzy contrast enhancement technique on mammogram images. The images are fuzzified based on maximum entropy principle and the local contrast is measured and enhanced using local and global information. Kuppannan [16] proposed an intuitionistic fuzzy enhancement on text documents where they extended the fuzzy contrast intensification operator in intuitionistic fuzzy domain. Hasikin [15] proposed a fuzzy method to enhance low contrast images where they used S membership functions and the parameters in the membership function are computed using index of fuzziness and entropy and tested on human face images.There is also some work on contrast enhancement using intuitionistic fuzzy set introduced by Atannasov [2] that considers two uncertainties – membership and non membership degree. It takes into account the hesitation while defining the membership function in fuzzy set. Due to the hesitation degree, the non membership function in intuitionistic fuzzy set is not the complement of the membership degree as in fuzzy set rather less than or equal to the complement of the membership degree. Intuitionistic fuzzy enhancement was suggested by Vlachos and Sergiadis [24] where they used different types of intuitionistic fuzzy entropies to enhance the contrast of the images.Zadeh [28] suggested that fuzziness is also present in the membership function of ordinary (Type I) fuzzy set and thus he introduced Type II fuzzy set, where the membership function is characterized as fuzzy and thus the membership function lies in an interval range. It represents the uncertainty in a better way. There is very little work on Type II fuzzy based image enhancement. Ensafi and Tizoosh [11] suggested Type II fuzzy enhancement where they created a new membership function using the two levels of membership function. Mohanalin [19] proposed an enhancement and detection method to find the microcalcification in mammograms using Tsallias entropy and Type II fuzzy set. They initially enhanced the image and then thresholded to detect the micro calcification present in the image.This paper presents a novel approach to enhance medical images using Type II Fuzzy set to increase the contrast of the medical images. Hamacher T co norm is used as an aggregation operator to form a new membership function using upper and lower membership function of Type II fuzzy set. To show the efficacy of the proposed method, the proposed method is compared with non fuzzy, fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy, and existing Type II fuzzy methods and the results using the proposed method are found to be better. Also, to show the advantage of the proposed image enhancement scheme, enhanced images are segmented to detect or extract abnormal lesions or blood vessels. Segmented images on the proposed enhancement method are observed to be better as compared to the segmented images using other existing enhancement algorithms.A preliminary part of the proposed image enhancement work is published by Chaira [6].The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 relates to the preliminaries of Type II fuzzy set. Section 3 outlines the Fuzzy T co norms. Section 4 discusses the proposed method. Section 5 exhibits and discusses the results. Section 6 tells about the advantage of image enhancement in medical images and finally the conclusion is drawn in Section 7.Type II fuzzy set is useful in situation where the membership values are such that it is difficult to agree with accurate membership values. This is due to the fact that some uncertainty is present in location or shape or other parameters. Type II fuzzy set accounts this uncertainty by considering another degree of freedom for better representation of uncertainty where the membership functions are themselves fuzzy [17,18]. Type II fuzzy set is obtained by blurring Type I fuzzy set. So, if the membership function of Type I fuzzy set is blurred, Type II fuzzy set is obtained. So, one can define Type I fuzzy set and assign upper and lower membership degrees to each element to construct a footprint of uncertainty (FOU). Fuzzy sets of type II are the fuzzy sets for which the membership function does not have a single value for every element but an interval. A type-2 fuzzy is be written as:ATypeII={x,μ⌢A(x)|x∈X}whereμ⌢A(x)type-2 membership function.When the FOU is uniform, it represents an interval Type II fuzzy set and this can be described in terms of lower and upper membership function. These are written as:(1)μupper=[μ(x)]αμlower=[μ(x)]1/αwhere α∈(0, 1]. So, a more practical form of representing Type II fuzzy set is written as:ATypeII={x,μU(x),μL(x)|x∈X}and μL(x)<μ(x)<μU(x), μ∈[0, 1].A fuzzy set is an extension of an ordinary set theory and the operators in ordinary set theory can be extended to operators that are capable of realization of the same union, intersection, and complement logical operators in a multi-valued logic. In fuzzy set theory, these operators are called T norms (T) and T conorms (T*). Till today, there are many T norms and T conorms given by Yager [26], Hamacher, Dombi [10], Weber [25] and so on. These operators are classified as a class of (i) conditional operators that contain min or max term or (ii) algebraic operator that are purely algebraic that do not contain min or max [20]. In this work, algebraic operators are used as these operators do not contain min or max term and reveal the actual value. Conditional class operator do not lead to a realization of T conorm though they are computationally simple as these operators contain min-max terms. There are many fuzzy T norms and co norms that contains max, min operator (conditional class) and few of them are mentioned below.(i)YagerT norm=Yp(x,y)=1−min([(1−x)p+(1−y)p](1/p),1)with decreasing generator fp(x)=(1−x)pwith f−1(y)=1−y1/p, p>0T co norm=Yp*(x,y)=min([xp+yp](1/p),1)with increasing generator gp(x)=xpandgp−1(y)=y1/pSome existing algebraic operators are given below.Hamacher suggested an algebraic T norm and T conorm that does not contain min or max operatorsHγ(x,y)=x.yγ+(1−γ).(x+y−x.y), γ>0 is a T norm with decreasing generator as:fγ(x)=1γlnγ+(1−γ).xxandfγ−1(y)=γ.e−γ.y1−(1−γ).e−γ.y(2)andHγ*(x,y)=x+y−x.y−(1−γ)xy1−(1−γ).xyis a T conorm with increasing generatorgγ(x)=1γlnγ+(1−γ).(1−x)1−xandgγ−1(y)=1−e−γ.y1−(1−γ).e−γ.yDombi also proposed T norm and T conorm that are algebraic(3)D(x,y)=11+1x−1λ+1y−1λ1/λD*(x,y)=11+1x−1−λ+1y−1−λ−1/λInitially the image (say A) of size M×M is initially fuzzified using the formula:(4)μ'(gij)=g−gmingmax−gminwhere g is the gray level of the image ranges from 0 to L-1. gmax and gmin are the maximum and minimum values of the gray levels of the image.The upper and lower ranges of Type II fuzzy membership function are calculated using Eq. (1) with α=0.8. The decision is to be made about the value of α. Fuzzy linguistic hedges 0<α≤1 is used to generate lower and the upper membership functions from a type-1 fuzzy membership function. In most applications, the parameter α is usually determined heuristically to satisfy the requirement 0<α≤1 which has been verified experimentally. In this experiment, the contrast enhanced image results with α=0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 are shown. It is observed that as α value increases, the enhanced images are also looking better. But with α<0.6, the enhanced images are not so clear. With α=0.2 and 0.3, the enhanced image are so bright that the clot is hardly visible. With α=0.6 and 0.7, the results are improving and with α=0.8, the enhanced image is much clearer and the dense blood clot is also darker than the background. So the acceptable limit of α is α>0.6. This has been verified in Fig. 1. With α=0.8, the enhanced image has a better contrast.The reason is that when α values are small, the lower level membership values are very small. As for example say for μ=0.3,(i)α=0.2,μlower=0.3^(1/0.2)=0.0024and μupper=0.3^(0.2)=0.785.α=0.5,μlower=0.3^(1/0.5)=0.09and μupper=0.3^(0.5)=0.547.α=0.6,μlower=0.3^(1/0.6)=0.134and μupper=0.3^(0.6)=0.485.α=0.7,μlower=0.3^(1/0.7)=0.179and μupper=0.3^(0.7)=0.430.With μ<0.3, the membership values of the lower level will be much less.Thus, with higher α values (e.g. α>0.6), membership values are feasible and so the enhanced images are also better.Next, a membership function is computed that considers both the upper and lower membership functions using the Hamacher T conorm. There is also Dombi operator as mentioned above, but Dombi's T conorm does not give better result as verified in Fig. 2. The enhanced images are so bright that the structures are hardly visible. Hamacher T conorm is used to find the two membership levels. Using Hamacher T conorm in Eq. (2) we have:(5)μenh(gij)=μupper+μlower+(λ−2)μupper.μlower1−(1−λ)μupper.μlowerμupper(gij) andμlower(gij)are the upper and lower membership functions of the Type II fuzzy set respectively which are computed using Eq. (1):(6)μlower(gij)=μ'(gij)1/αμupperr(gij)=μ'(gij)αandλ=img_avgwhere img_avg is the average of the image. With this value, the results are observed to be better.The image with new membership function is the Type II fuzzy image. As membership function in Type I fuzzy set is considered fuzzy, Type II fuzzy image is visually much clearer and brighter than the original image. The Type II fuzzy image so formed is an enhanced image. Enhancement has also been carried out by dividing the images into several windows. But, very slight change is observed. This is shown in Fig. 3and Table 1. So, in this paper, the entire image is considered.
