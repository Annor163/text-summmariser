@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Deriving accurate interval weights from interval fuzzy preference relations is key to successfully solving decision making problems. Xu and Chen (2008) proposed a number of linear programming models to derive interval weights, but the definitions for the additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relation and the linear programming model still need to be improved. In this paper, a numerical example is given to show how these definitions and models can be improved to increase accuracy. A new additive consistency definition for interval fuzzy preference relations is proposed and novel linear programming models are established to demonstrate the generation of interval weights from an interval fuzzy preference relation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was proposed by Saaty (1980), it has been widely studied and applied to decision making problems. However, because of the complexity of real life decision making problems, it is often difficult for decision maker to estimate exact preferences, so normally these are expressed using interval numbers, which is known as a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). In decision making, both the interval fuzzy preference relation (IFPR) and the interval reciprocal preference relation (IRPR) are useful when expressing a decision maker’s uncertain preference. However, when determining these relations, interval consistency and an accurate generation of the interval weights are important. Xu and Chen (2008) first defined the IFPR’s additive and multiplicative consistency and established several models to derive the interval weights. The purpose of this note is to highlight the inaccuracies in Definitions 3 and 4, (M-1) and (M-2) using an example, and to present modified Definitions and Models. The definitions and models in Xu and Chen (2008) are briefly discussed.Throughout Xu and Chen (2008),X={x1,x2,…,xn}used as the set of criteria,R=(rij)n×nis the fuzzy preference relation (FPR), whererijrepresents a crisp preference degree for criterionxioverxjprovided by experts.R∼=(r̃ij)n×nis the IFPR, wherer̃ij=[rij-,rij+](i,j∈I)indicates that criterionxiis betweenrij-andrij+times as important as criterionxj.W=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tis a positive normalized weight vector, wherewireflects the degree of importance ofxiand allwisatisfy(1)wi⩾0(i=1,2,…,n),∑i=1nwi=1.Definition 1Orlovski (1978)A fuzzy preference relation on a finite set X withn⩾1elements is represented by a complementary matrixR=(rij)n×nwithA fuzzy preference relationR=(rij)n×nis called an additive consistent FPR, if the following additive transitivity is satisfiedLetR∼=(r̃ij)n×nbeing an IFPR. If there exists a positive normalized weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)T, such thatFrom the definition for the IFPR, Definition 3 is equivalent to Definition 4.Definition 4See Xu and Chen (2008), Definition 4LetR∼=(r̃ij)n×nbeing an IFPR, wherer̃ij=[rij-,rij+](i,j∈I). If there exists a positive normalized weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)T, such thatBased on Definition 4, (M-1) and (M-2) (See Xu & Chen (2008), (M-1) and (M-2)) are established to derive the lower and upper bounds of the interval weight.wk-=minwks.t.0.5(wi-wj+1)⩾rij-,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.0.5(wi-wj+1)⩽rij+,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.∑i∈Iwi=1,wi⩾0,i=1,2,…,n.(M-1)wk+=maxwks.t.0.5(wi-wj+1)⩾rij-,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.0.5(wi-wj+1)⩽rij+,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.∑i∈Iwi=1,wi⩾0,i=1,2,…,n.(M-2)Definitions 3 and 4 define the additive consistency of an IFPR, and (M-1) and (M-2) can assist in generating the lower and upper bounds of the weights. However, some additive consistent IFPRs may not satisfy the conditions for Definitions 3 and 4. At the same time, the feasible region in (M-1) and (M-2) for the additive consistent IFPR may be empty. In the following section, a numerical example is illustrated to demonstrate this situation.Example 1Consider a fuzzy preference relationIt satisfies thatr12=0.7=0.5-0.3+0.5=r11-r21+0.5,r12=0.7=0.7-0.5+0.5=r12-r22+0.5,r12=0.7=0.9-0.7+0.5=r13-r23+0.5,r13=0.9=0.5-0.1+0.5=r11-r31+0.5,r13=0.9=0.7-0.3+0.5=r12-r32+0.5,r13=0.9=0.9-0.5+0.5=r13-r33+0.5,r23=0.7=0.3-0.1+0.5=r21-r31+0.5,r23=0.7=0.5-0.3+0.5=r22-r32+0.5,r23=0.7=0.7-0.5+0.5=r23-r33+0.5, according to Definition 2, R is an additive consistent FPR.Furthermore,R=(rij)3×3=R∼=(r̃ij)3×3=[0.5,0.5][0.7,0.7][0.9,0.9][0.3,0.3][0.5,0.5][0.7,0.7][0.1,0.1][0.3,0.3][0.5,0.5]is a special additive consistent IFPR, whererij-=rij+=rij,∀i,j=1,2,3.According to Definition 3, ifR∼is an additive consistent IFPR, there exists a positive normalized weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)T, such thatrij-⩽0.5(wi-wj+1)⩽rij+(i,j=1,2,3). In this way,0.5(w1-w1+1)=0.5,0.5(w1-w2+1)=0.70.5(w1-w3+1)=0.9,0.5(w2-w1+1)=0.30.5(w2-w2+1)=0.5,0.5(w2-w3+1)=0.70.5(w3-w1+1)=0.1,0.5(w3-w2+1)=0.30.5(w3-w3+1)=0.5,w1+w2+w3=1⇔0.5(w1-w2+1)=0.70.5(w1-w3+1)=0.9w1+w2+w3=1⇔w1=1115w2=13w3=-115It can be seen that the solutionW=1115,13,-115Tdoes not satisfy Eq. (1). In other words, there is not a positive normalized weight vectorW=(w1,w2,w3)T, such that∀i,j=1,2,3:rij-⩽0.5(wi-wj+1)⩽rij+, so according to Definition 3,R∼is not an additive consistent IFPR.When solving (M-1) and (M-2), no feasible solution can be found, this indicates thatR∼is not an additive consistent IFPR.However, according to Definition 2,R∼=Ris an additive consistent FPR. This indicates that, the Definition 3 is able to take an additive consistent IFPR as the additive inconsistent IFPR. In this case, the concept of the additive consistent IFPR needs to be improved. In the next part, an improved definition for the additive consistent IFPR is proposed.In this section, an improved concept for the additive consistent IFPR is proposed and several models based on this new additive consistency definition are established to derive the interval weights.Definition 5LetR∼=(r̃ij)n×nbe an IFPR, wherer̃ij=[rij-,rij+](i,j∈I). If there exists a positive normalized weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tand a positive parameter c, such thatAccording to the definition for the IFPR, Definition 5 is equivalent to Definition 6:Definition 6LetR∼=(r̃ij)n×nbe an IFPR, wherer̃ij=[rij-,rij+](i,j∈I). If there exists a positive normalized weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tand a positive parameter c, such thatFor an additive consistent IFPRR∼=(r̃ij)n×n,c⩾(n-1)/2is a sufficient condition for∀i=1,2,…,n:wi⩾0, where∀i,j=1,2,…,n:rij-⩽c(wi-wj)+0.5⩽rij+and∑i=1nwi=1.ForR∼=(r̃ij)n×nto be an additive consistent IFPR, there exists a positive normalized weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tand a positive parameter c, such that∀i,j=1,2,…,n:rij-⩽c(wi-wj)+0.5⩽rij+. Then∀i=1,2,…,n:∑j=1n(rij--0.5)⩽∑j=1nc(wi-wj)⩽∑j=1n(rij+-0.5). Further∀i=1,2,…,n:1c∑j=1n(rij--0.5)⩽nwi-∑j=1nwj⩽1c∑j=1n(rij+-0.5).For∑i=1nwi=1,∀i=1,2,…,n:1c∑j=1n(rij--0.5)⩽nwi-1⩽1c∑j=1n(rij+-0.5).So,∀i=1,2,…,n:1n+1nc∑j=1n(rij--0.5)⩽wi⩽1n+1nc∑j=1n(rij+-0.5).For(n-1)/2⩾∑j=1n|rij--0.5|, thenc⩾∑j=1n|rij--0.5|. So,-1n⩽1cn∑j=1n(rij--0.5)⩽1n. Therefore,∀i=1,2,…,n:wi⩾1n+1nc∑j=1n(rij--0.5)⩾0.□Usually,(n-1)/2can be taken as the value for parameter c.Definition 7LetR∼=(r̃ij)n×nbe an IFPR, wherer̃ij=[rij-,rij+](i,j=1,2,…,n). If there exists a positive normalized weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)T, such thatFrom Definition 7, several models can be established to derive the priority weights.(1)IfR∼=(r̃ij)n×nis an additive consistent IFPR, two linear programming models can then be established to derive the priority weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)T.wk-=minwks.t.0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5⩾rij-,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5⩽rij+,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.∑i∈Iwi=1,wi⩾0,i=1,2,…,n.(M-3)wk+=maxwks.t.0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5⩾rij-,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5⩽rij+,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.∑i∈Iwi=1,wi⩾0,i=1,2,…,n.(M-4)For eachk∈I, solving(M-3)and(M-4), the range[wk-,wk+]of each weightwkcan be determined.According to the IFPR in Example 1, work out(M-3)and(M-4)and the ranges for each weight can be obtained, which are shown in Table 1.For the additive consistent IFPR in Example 1, no feasible solution can be found by solving (M-1) and (M-2). However, the interval weights can be successfully determined by solving (M-3) and (M-4).IfR∼=(r̃ij)n×nis not an additive consistent IFPR, then a linear goal programming model is established to adjust the IFPR elements.R∼=(r̃ij)n×nis an additive consistent IFPR if and only ifJ1∗=0.(1)IfR∼=(r̃ij)n×nis an additive consistent IFPR, thenJ1∗=0.R∼=(r̃ij)n×nis an additive consistent IFPR, according to Definition 7 as there exists a positive normalized weight vectorW=(w1,w2,…,wn)T, such that∀i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n:rij-⩽0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5⩽rij+. For the first and second constraints in(M-5),dij-=dij+=0can satisfy the constraints. Then,J1∗=0.IfJ1∗=0, thenR∼=(r̃ij)n×nis an additive consistent IFPR.IfJ1∗=0, thendij-=dij+=0(i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n). The first and second constraints change to0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5⩾rij-,0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5⩽rij+,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n. With the constraintwi⩾0(i∈I),∑i∈Iwi=1, according to Definition 7,R∼=(r̃ij)n×nis an additive consistent IFPR.□The adjusted deviationdij-,dij+(i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n)can be determined by solving(M-5). With the adjusted deviation, the following linear programming models can be established to derive the interval weights.wk-=minwks.t.0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5+dij-⩾rij-,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5-dij+⩽rij+,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.∑i∈Iwi=1,wi⩾0,i=1,2,…,n.(M-6)wk+=maxwks.t.0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5+dij-⩾rij-,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.0.5(n-1)(wi-wj)+0.5-dij+⩽rij+,i=1,2,…,n-1;j=i+1,…,n.∑i∈Iwi=1,wi⩾0,i=1,2,…,n.(M-7)For eachk∈I, solving(M-6,7), the range for eachwkcan be determined.
