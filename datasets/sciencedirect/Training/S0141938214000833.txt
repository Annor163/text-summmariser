Stimulus duration thresholds for reading numerical time information: Effects of visual size and number of time units

Perceptual thresholds for reading numerical time vary with visual size and length.Larger numbers of time units require exponentially more reading time.Range of optimal visual sizes decreases with the number of time units to be read.

We examined the effects of the visual size and the number of digits on reading numerical time information in young adults. Using an adaptive staircase procedure, minimal stimulus presentation duration (MSPD) for 80%-correct responses was determined for visual sizes ranging from 0.1° to 15°, when reading 1 (“mm”), 2 (“hh:mm”) or 3 (“hh:mm:ss”) 2-digit units of time information. All three time types revealed U-shaped relations between MSPD and visual size, with the characteristics of the relation depending on the number of time units. Time type had two different effects. First, longer time types gave rise to longer MSPDs, as more elements needed to be encoded into working memory. Second, longer time types gave rise to smaller ranges of optimal visual character size, decreasing from 0.2–2° for the 1-unit time type to 0.3–0.5° for the 3-unit time type. The lower boundary of the optimal range of visual size may be understood as resulting from acuity limitations. The shift in the upper boundary of the optimal range of visual size is suggested to reflect the change in size of the visual span associated with larger visual character sizes.

A consequence of the increasing presence in daily life of electronic accessories with visual displays is that we are more and more confronted with numerical information. While numbers may of course be represented in word form by verbal numerals (e.g., “seven” or “twenty-four”), representation in digit form by Arabic numerals (e.g., “7” or “24”) allows a much more efficient use of presentation space. Numerical time information, for instance, is typically presented by two-digit groups of Arabic numerals, separated by colons.Although digit-form numerical information is extensively used in displays, number legibility has not received the same amount of experimental attention as text legibility. As a result, visual ergonomics has either implicitly assimilated numbers to letters (or words) or has simply ignored them. Interestingly in this regard, the European standard of requirements for electronic visual displays [15] defines minimal, maximal, and preferable visual sizes for text characters, but not for number characters. Yet, important neuroanatomical and functional differences have been demonstrated between number reading and text reading [3,4,10,11,12,25,33,40,43,47].Low-level visual processes underlying the identification of individual digits may be expected to be similar to those underlying the identification of individual letters, but multi-digit numbers cannot be assimilated with multi-letter words: The latter are characterized by recognizable global patterns that allow individual characters to be ignored (cf., [5,39,44,46,49]) while the former are not. Moreover, while numbers can be formed by any combination of digits, certain combinations of letters form words while others do not. Using an established psychophysical method, in the present contribution we examined the effects of the visual size and the number of digits on reading numerically represented time information.Under normal contrast and luminance conditions, the speed of text reading is maximal when the letter characters subtend visual angles between 0.3° and 2° [7,22]. Below 0.3° of visual angle text reading speed decreases (also see [16,24] for electronic devices), most likely due to limitations in visual acuity. Beyond 2° of visual angle text reading speed also decreases, indicating that the use of larger characters is not necessarily beneficial [22]; also see [50]. This latter effect has been attributed to decreasing letter acuity in peripheral vision, crowding between adjacent characters, and decreasing accuracy of position signals in peripheral vision [18]. These mechanisms can give rise to an increase in the number of fixations, separated by the saccadic eye movements that characterize text reading [41,46]. Because the effect of character size in text reading is thus mainly explained by low-level visual processing characteristics, one may expect similar effects of character size in number reading. Our working hypothesis was thus that number reading would reveal an optimal size interval that lies in the same range (0.3–2° of visual angle) as that identified for text reading.Word length is known to influence reading speed [19], with longer words evoking longer fixation durations [14,27], presumably due to the increase in the quantity and complexity of information that needs to be processed [38]. Longer numbers (i.e., numbers with more digits) also require a longer processing time [11,32], which is known as the magnitude effect [3]. Yet, processing of Arabic numbers is quite different from processing verbal material [3,26,40,43] and therefore the reasons underlying the word-length effect cannot be directly transposed to the magnitude effect. Moreover, rather than giving rise to longer numbers, increasing the precision of numerical time information typically leads to series-extensions of two-digit numbers, representing for instance hours (hh), minutes (mm), and seconds (ss). While it remains unclear whether two-digit numbers are processed separately or as an ensemble [3,25,28,35], reading numerical time involves processing of a series of two-digit numbers. Based on the effects of the number of units to be processed on processing duration (e.g., [45]), an increase in the number of two-digit numbers is expected to lead to an increase in the required reading time.In the present study we determined the minimal visual presentation duration required to accurately read numerical time information. Using a psychophysical staircasing procedure [17], we explored the effects of character size and number of two-digit information units.
