@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper develops primal and dual versions of the dynamic Luenberger productivity growth measures that are based on the dynamic directional distance function and intertemporal cost minimization, respectively. The empirical application focuses on panel data of Dutch dairy farms over the period 1995–2005. Primal dynamic Luenberger productivity growth averages 1.5 percent annually in the period under investigation, with technical change being the main driver of annual change. Dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth is −0.1 percent in the same period. Improvements in technical inefficiency and technical change are partly counteracted by deteriorations of allocative inefficiency, with large dairy farms presenting a slightly higher productivity growth than small dairy farms.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The characterization and measurement of economic performance in both theory and practice continues to claim considerable attention in the literature. The major attention of economic performance centers on the measurement of efficiency and productivity growth. The economics literature on efficiency has produced a wide range of productivity growth measures (see Balk, 2008 for a comprehensive treatment).The setting of the decision environment plays a crucial role in the modeling framework and the characterization of results. The static models of production are based on the firm's ability to adjust instantaneously and ignore the potential dynamic linkages of production decisions. The business policy relevance to distinguishing between the contributions of variable and capital factors to inefficiency or productivity growth is clear. For example, when variable factor use is not meeting its potential, remedies can include better monitoring of resource use; when asset use is not meeting potential, remedies can include training programs to enhance performance or even a review of the organization of assets in the production process to take advantage of asset utilization. The weakness underlying the static theory of production in explaining how some inputs are gradually adjusted has led to the development of the dynamic models of production where current production decisions constrain or enhance future production possibilities.Allowing for the presence of dynamic adjustment leads productivity growth measurement to include a scale and technical change effects (as in the static theory) in addition to capital stock adjustment and the impact of the changing shadow values on long-run equilibrium capital stocks and investment (Luh &#38; Stefanou, 1991). This decomposition can be further elaborated to account for efficiency change (Rungsuriyawiboon &#38; Stefanou, 2008).The characterization of dynamic efficiency can also build on the adjustment cost framework that implicitly measures inefficiency as a temporal concept as it accounts for the sluggish adjustment of some factors. In a nonparametric setting, Silva and Stefanou (2007) develop a myriad of efficiency measures associated with the dynamic generalization of the dual-based revealed preference approach to production analysis found in Silva and Stefanou (2003). In a parametric setting, Rungsuriyawiboon and Stefanou (2007) present and estimate the dynamic shadow price approach to dynamic cost minimization.An intriguing prospect is to incorporate the properties of the dynamic production technology presented in Silva and Stefanou (2003) into the directional distance function framework, which can exploit the Luenberger productivity growth measurement. The directional distance function offers the powerful advantage of focusing on changes in input and output bundles, inefficiency and the technology. Such a productivity measure based on the directional distance function has its origins in Chambers, Chung, and Färe (1996) who defined a Luenberger indicator of productivity growth in the static context. A growing literature employing this approach has emerged more recently (see Balk, 2008; Boussemart, Briec, Kerstens, &#38; Poutineau, 2003; Briec &#38; Kerstens, 2004; Chambers &#38; Pope, 1996; Chambers et al., 1996; Färe &#38; Grosskopf, 2005; Färe &#38; Primont, 2003). The dual approach to measuring Luenberger productivity growth in the static context has been elaborated by e.g. Färe, Grosskopf, and Margaritis (2008), but has hardly been applied in the literature.This paper develops primal and dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth indicators that are based on the dynamic directional distance function and the intertemporal cost function, respectively. The adverbs ‘primal’ and ‘dual’ refer to the models that are underlying the computation of the productivity indicators, i.e. the intertemporal cost function used for computing the dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth indicator is dual to the primal distance function that underlies the computation of the primal dynamic Luenberger productivity growth indicator. The primal Luenberger productivity growth indicator is decomposed to identify the contributions of efficiency growth and technical change, while the dual Luenberger productivity growth indicator offers a further decomposition to identify the impact of quasi-fixed factor disequilibrium and allocative efficiency change. An illustration of these measures is applied to a panel of Dutch dairy farms over 1995–2005.The next section develops the primal and dual measures of dynamic productivity growth and its decomposition. This is followed by the empirical application to the panel of Dutch dairy farms which uses the results of a previously estimated dynamic directional distance function found in Serra, Oude Lansink, and Stefanou (2011) to generate the primal and dual measures of productivity growth and their respective decompositions. The final section offers concluding comments.The primal Luenberger indicator of dynamic productivity growth is defined through a dynamic directional distance function. Letyt∈ℜ++Mrepresent a vector of outputs at time t,xt∈ℜ+Ndenote a vector of variable inputs,Kt∈ℜ++Fthe capital stock vector,It∈ℜ+Fthe vector of gross investments andLt∈ℜ++Ca vector of fixed inputs for which no investments are allowed. The production input requirement set can be represented as Vt(yt: Kt, Lt) = {(xt, It): (xt, It) can produce ytgiven Kt, Lt}. The input requirement set is defined by Silva and Stefanou (2003) and assumed to have the following properties: Vt(yt: Kt, Lt) is a closed and nonempty set, has a lower bound, is positive monotonic in xt, negative monotonic in It, is a strictly convex set, output levels increase with the stock of capital and quasi-fixed inputs and are freely disposable.The input-oriented dynamic directional distance functionD→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)can be defined as follows:(1)D→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)=max{β∈ℜ:(xt−βgx,It+βgI)∈Vt(yt:Kt,Lt)},gx∈ℜ++N,gI∈ℜ++F,(gx,gI)≠(0N,0F)if (xt− βgx, It+ βgI) ∈ Vt(yt: Kt, Lt) for some β,D→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)=−∞, otherwise. The distance function is a measure of the maximal translation of (xt, It) in the direction defined by the vector (gx, gI), that keeps the translated input combination interior to the set Vt(yt: Kt, Lt). Since βgxis subtracted from xtand βgIis added to It, the directional distance function is defined by simultaneously contracting variable inputs and expanding gross investments. As shown by Silva, Oude Lansink, and Stefanou (2009),D→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)≥0fully characterizes the input requirement set Vt(yt: Kt, Lt), being thus an alternative primal representation of the adjustment cost production technology.Extending the Luenberger indicator of productivity growth defined by Chambers et al. (1996) to the dynamic setting by using the dynamic directional distance function (assuming Variable Returns to Scale) leads to:(2)LP(·)=12{[D→t+1i(yt,Kt,Ltxt,It;gx,gI)−D→t+1i(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1xt+1,It+1;gx,gI)]+[D→ti(yt,Kt,Ltxt,It;gx,gI)−D→ti(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1xt+1,It+1;gx,gI)]}This indicator provides the arithmetic average of productivity change measured by the technology at time t + 1 [the first two terms in Eq. (2)] and the productivity change measured by the technology at time t [the last two terms in Eq. (2)].The Luenberger indicator of dynamic productivity growth is illustrated graphically in Fig. 1(for ease of exposition, it is assumed that output is the same in both periods; the capital stock K differs across periods). The quantities of inputs and investments at time t and time t + 1 are denoted as (xt, It) and (xt + 1, It + 1), respectively. The dynamic directional distance function measures the distance to the isoquants at time t and time t + 1, which is denoted asD→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI). The Luenberger indicator of dynamic productivity growth can be decomposed into the contributions of technical inefficiency change (ΔTEI) and technical change (ΔT):(3)LP(·)=ΔT+ΔTEIThe decomposition of productivity growth is obtained from Eq. (2) by adding and subtracting the term[D→t+1i(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,xt+1,It+1;gx,gI)−D→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)]. Technical change is computed as the arithmetic average of the difference between the technology (represented by the frontier) at time t and time t + 1, evaluated using quantities at time t [first two terms in Eq. (4)] and time t + 1 [last two terms in Eq. (4)]:(4)ΔT=12{[D→t+1i(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)−D→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)]+[D→t+1i(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,xt+1,It+1;gx,gI)−D→ti(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,xt+1,It+1;gx,gI)]}Technical change can be seen in Fig. 1 as the average distance between the two isoquants. This involves evaluating the isoquants using quantities at time t,D→t+1i(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)−D→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI), and quantities at time t + 1,D→t+1i(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,xt+1,It+1;gx,gI)−D→ti(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,xt+1,It+1;gx,gI). Dynamic technical inefficiency change is the difference between the value of the dynamic directional distance function at time t and time t + 1:(5)ΔTEI=D→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)−D→t+1i(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,xt+1,It+1;gx,gI)Technical inefficiency change is easily seen from Fig. 1 as the difference between the distance functions evaluated using quantities and technologies in period t and period t + 1.It is assumed that firms are intertemporally cost minimizing and thus they take their decisions in accordance with the following optimization problem:(6)Wt(yt,Kt,Lt,wt,ct)=minx,I∫t∞e−rt[wt′xt+ct′Kt]dts.t.K˙t=It−δKtD→i(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)≥0wherewt∈ℜ++Nis a variable input price vector,ct∈ℜ++Fis a vector of capital rental prices,δis a diagonal matrix containing depreciation rates and r is the discount rate. Within this framework, Ktis a vector of initial capital stocks at a certain point in time. Capital is acquired through gross investment, Itwhich depreciates at a fixed proportional rate,δ. Under our dynamic cost minimization framework, we assume that firms choose investment so as to minimize the present value of the sum of future production costs over an infinite time horizon.The Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation corresponding to the optimization program can be expressed as:(7)rWt(yt,Kt,Lt,wt,ct)=minx,I{wt′xt+ct′Kt+WKt(yt,Kt,Lt,wt,ct)′(It−δKt)+λD→ti(yt,Kt,Lt,xt,It;gx,gI)}where WKt(yt, Kt, Lt, wt, ct) is the firm-specific, shadow value of capital and the Lagrangian multiplier, λ, can be shown to be the cost indicatorλ=WKt(yt,Kt,Lt,wt,ct)′gI−wt′gx(Silva et al., 2009). The dynamic dual form of the Luenberger dynamic productivity growth indicator is formulated in terms of the differences between observed costs and minimum costs as follows,(8)LD(·)=12[(wt′xt+ct′Kt+WKt+1,t(It−δKt))−rWt+1(yt,Kt,Lt,wt,ct)wtgx−WKt+1,tgI+(wt′xt+ct′Kt+WKt(It−δKt))−rWt(yt,Kt,Lt,wt,ct)wtgx−WKtgI]−12[(wt+1′xt+1+ct+1′Kt+1+WKt+1(It+1−δKt+1))−rWt+1(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,wt+1,ct+1)wt+1gx−WKt+1gI+(wt+1′xt+1+ct+1′Kt+1+WKt,t+1(It+1−δKt+1))−rWt(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,wt+1,ct+1)wt+1gx−WKt,t+1gI]This indicator computes the arithmetic mean of two components. The first component consists of two ratios in which the second ratio measures the difference between observed shadow cost of production at time t SCt= wtxt+ ctKt+ WKt(It− Kt), and the minimum shadow cost measured by the optimal value function at time t using the prices in time t [i.e., rWt(yt, Kt, Lt, wt, ct)]. The first ratio measures the difference between the observed and minimum shadow costs using prices and quantities at time t and the frontier in t + 1. The differences between the observed and minimum shadow costs in the first and second ratios are scaled by the shadow value of the direction vector, implying that the ratios are unit free. Note that the shadow price of capital, WKt + 1, t, in the first ratio is measured from the cost frontier at time t + 1 and prices and quantities at time t; i.e., WKt + 1, t= WKt + 1(yt, Kt, Lt, wt, ct). The third and fourth ratios are similar to the first two ratios and measure the difference between observed and minimum shadow costs using prices and quantities at time t + 1. The shadow price of capital (WKt, t + 1) in the fourth ratio is measured from the cost frontier at time t and prices and quantities at time t + 1 (i.e. WKt, t + 1 = WKt(yt + 1, Kt + 1, Lt + 1, wt + 1, ct + 1)). Note that LD(·) is only defined in case the denominator in Eq. (8) is non-zero. This condition is satisfied if at least one of the directional vectors gxand gIare non-zero.As in the primal case, the dual dynamic Luenberger productivity indicator can be decomposed to identify the contributions of technical change (ΔTD) and technical efficiency change (ΔTEI). But now that this measure embodies an optimization objective (intertemporal cost minimization), we can additionally address the contribution of allocative inefficiency change (ΔAEI) and the change in the shadow value of capital (ΔSV):(9)LD(·)=ΔTD+ΔTEI+ΔAEI+ΔSVWhile the first three components of the right-hand-side of Eq. (9) have direct analogs to the static case, the component ΔSV requires some elaboration. Once we allow for disequilibirum in quasi-fixed factor use, it is clear from Eq. (7) that the notion of an internally generated shadow price of capital plays the role of a price component for the net investement infusions. In particular, changes in the captial stock lead to shifts in the shadow price of capital, which must be addressed in the productivity growth indicator.Technical change is computed as the arithmetic mean of the normalized distance between the optimal value frontiers, evaluated at prices and quantities in period t and period t + 1, respectively, as(10)ΔTD(·)=12[(rWt(yt,Kt,Lt,wt,ct))wtgx−WKtgI−rWt+1(yt,Kt,Lt,wt,ct)wtgx−WKt+1,tgI]+12[rWt(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,wt+1,ct+1)wt+1gx−WKt,t+1gI−rWt+1(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,wt+1,ct+1)wt+1gx−WKt+1gI]The overall inefficiency change is given by:(11)ΔLOEI(·)=[(wt′xt+ct′Kt+WKt(It−δKt))−rWt(yt,Kt,Lt,wt,ct)wtgx−WKtgI−(wt+1′xt+1+ct+1′Kt+1+WKt+1(It+1−δKt+1))−rWt+1(yt+1,Kt+1,Lt+1,wt+1,ct+1)wt+1gx−WKt+1gI]Allocative inefficiency change can be identified as the difference between overall inefficiency change Eq. (11) and the primal estimate of technical inefficiency change in Eq. (5):(12)ΔAEI=ΔLOEI−ΔTEIThe component to indicate a change over time is the shadow value of capital, WK. The change in the capital stock is driving changes in WK. In the case of the dual form of the dynamic Luenberger productivity indicator, the last component is the change in shadow cost of production, SCt, which is driven by the change in the shadow value of capital, which yields(13)ΔSV(·)=12[(wt′xt+ct′Kt+WKt+1,t(It−δKt))wtgx−WKt+1,tgI−(wt′xt+ct′Kt+WKt(It−δKt))wtgx−WKtgI]+12[(wt+1′xt+1+ct+1′Kt+1+WKt+1(It+1−δKt+1))wt+1gx−WKt+1gI−(wt+1′xt+1+ct+1′Kt+1+WKt,t+1(It+1−δKt+1))wt+1gx−WKt,t+1gI]Our empirical application focuses on a sample of specialized dairy farms in the Netherlands. Farm-level data are obtained from the European Commission's Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and cover the period 1995–2005. To ensure that milk output is the mainfarm output, we select those farms whose milk sales represent at least 80 percent of total farm income. The dataset is an unbalanced panel that contains 2614 observations on 639 farms that, on average, stay in the sample during 4 years.We distinguish one output, two variable inputs, two quasi-fixed inputs and two fixed inputs to keep the vector of estimated parameters to a manageable size. Output, y, is defined as a farm's total output and includes milk, livestock and livestock products, crops and crop products and other output. The two variable inputs are variable costs other than feed, x1, and feed expenses, x2. Variable x1 is an aggregate input that includes veterinary expenses, energy, contract work, crop-specific costs and other variable input costs. Breeding livestock is considered as a quasi-fixed input, K1. Machinery and buildings, also defined as quasi-fixed inputs, are aggregated into K2. Variables y, x1, x2, K1 and K2 are measured at constant 1995 prices. Total utilized agricultural area, L1, measured in hectares, and total labor input, L2 measured in annual working units (AWU), are assumed to be fixed inputs. Labor was assumed to be a fixed input because approximately 95 percent of the labor input was coming from the farm family in the sample period.Since output and input prices are unavailable from FADN, country-level price indices are taken from Eurostat's New Cronos Dataset. Netputs measured in monetary values are defined as implicit quantity indices by computing the ratio of value to its corresponding Tornqvist price index. Depreciation rates considered for buildings, machinery and breeding livestock are 3 percent, 10 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The interest rate (r) is defined as the average, over the period 1995–2005, of the annual interest rate for 10 years’ maturity government bonds (Eurostat) and is equal to 4.97 percent. Following Epstein and Denny (1983), Pietola and Myers (2000) and others, we assume that the current price of a quasi-fixed input can be derived as the discounted sum of the future rents on the depreciated asset. Based on this assumption, the rental cost price of capital is measured as ci= (r + δi)zi, where ziis the quasi-fixed asset price (defined as a Tornqvist price index).Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis. With quantity and price indexes used to construct the data, milk production accounts for 90 percent of the value of production, and variable expenses (of which 40 percent are feed expenses) are 43 percent relative to the value of production. The observed long-run cost represents almost 70 percent of total value of output. While breeding livestock gross investments are substantial, I1, net investments,K˙1, represent only 0.25 percent of K1, which is due to the milk quota system regulating EU's dairy sector and limiting this sector's growth. It should be noted though that the dairy quota system in the Netherlands allows farms to continue to grow by buying or leasing additional quota. Although the milk quota limits the possibilities for growth of the dairy herd, it does not prevent modernization of dairy holdings that, on average, have net investments in machinery and buildings of almost 7 percent per year.The estimation of the dynamic directional distance function and dynamic cost function can be done parametrically as in this study or nonparametrically. The nonparametric approach more easily allows for a further decomposition of productivity into the contributions of scale and congestion (see Epure, Kerstens, &#38; Prior, 2011). In addition, the nonparametric approach allows for firm-specific measurements of technical change, while the parametric approach requires assuming equal technical change across the farms in the sample or groups of farms within the sample as in latent class models. However, the nonparametric approach can be subject to computational issues when there is not wide variation in the benchmark technology which is largely determined by those firms identifying the boundary; i.e., V(y(t)|K(t).) such thatD→(yi,Ki,xi,Ii;gx,gI)≥0. With the computational problem being conditioned on input–output bundles and the data set for the dynamic factors exhibiting limited variation over this period, the dual based method can lead to limited variation in the shadow values.The empirical application builds on the parametric estimation of the dynamic directional distance function presented in Serra et al. (2011), using the Dutch dairy farming data set described above. Quantification of the dynamic directional distance and optimal value functions was achieved by econometric estimation. Following Chambers (2002) and Färe, Grosskopf, Noh, and Weber (2005), the quadratic function was used as a parametric specification for the directional distance function. Dynamic cost inefficiency is obtained by estimating a quadratic specification of the optimal value function. The empirical model and the results of the estimation are presented in Appendix A and are more elaborately discussed in Serra et al. (2011). The study yielded a dynamic directional distance function that is increasing in variable, quasi-fixed and fixed inputs and decreasing in output and investment demand, and a dynamic cost frontier that is increasing in prices of variable and quasi-fixed inputs and decreases with capital stock.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper develops primal and dual measures of dynamic Luenberger productivity growth that are based on the dynamic directional distance function and intertemporal cost minimization, respectively. The empirical illustration focuses on a panel of Dutch dairy farms over the period 1995–2005.Average primal dynamic Luenberger productivity growth is 1.5 percent in the period under investigation, with technical inefficiency change being the main driver of change. Productivity growth of large farms is higher (1.8 percent) than of small farms (1.1 percent). Dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth is −0.1 percent in the same period. Productivity growth of large dairy farms and small dairy farms are almost equal (−0.1 percent). In the period under investigation, improvements in technical inefficiency are partly counteracted by deteriorations of allocative inefficiency. Particularly, large farms have a negative (−1 percent ) contribution of allocative inefficiency change to productivity growth, suggesting that finding an optimal allocation of inputs in the long-run is more problematic for large rather than small dairy farms.This study has demonstrated the value of the dynamic Luenberger productivity indicators in that it allows for identifying the components of productivity growth. The dual dynamic Luenberger productivity growth indicator allows for a richer decomposition than the primal indicator as it also identifies contributions from allocative inefficiency change and change in the shadow value of capital.While this study focuses on the dynamic microeconomic decision making implications for efficiency and productivity, there are several interesting policy-related issues that can be gleaned from the empirical analysis. Technical change is a principal contributor to productivity growth followed by technical efficiency change. With technological innovations in this sector being driven externally, publicly supported R&#38;D activities and policies that can facilitate private sector R&#38;D being translated into marketed innovations are potential productivity-promoting actions. Knowledge translating and outreach activities to farmers can certainly promote efficiency improvements. Further, recognizing that large farms can benefit from allocative efficiency gains, targeted knowledge in translating and outreach activities tailored to their scope of activities can be fruitful.The quantification of the dynamic directional distance function was achieved by econometric estimation. The quadratic function was used as a parametric specification for the directional distance function as it offers the advantage that it can be easily restricted to satisfy the translation property. The quadratic specification is a flexible functional form that is twice differentiable in all its arguments. Setting gxi= 1, i = 1, …, N, gIj= 1, j = 1, …, F, M = 1 (i.e., we assume a single-output firm) and including a time trend (t), the distance function for the firm h can be expressed as follows, where time indicators have been ignored for simplicity:(A.1)D→hi(y,K,L,x,I,t;1,1)=a0+ayy+∑n=1CaLnLn+∑j=1FaIjIj+∑i=1Naxixi+∑j=1FaKjKj+12ayyy2+12∑n=1C∑n′=1CaLnLn′LnLn′+12∑j=1F∑j′=1FaIjIj′IjIj′+12∑i=1N∑i′=1Naxixi′xixi′+12∑j=1F∑j′=1FaKjKj′KjKj′+∑n=1CayLnyLn+∑j=1FayIjyIj+∑i=1Nayxiyxi+∑j=1FayKjyKj+∑n=1C∑j=1FaLnIjLnIj+∑n=1C∑i=1NaLnxiLnxi+∑n=1C∑j=1FaLnkjLnKj+∑j=1F∑i=1NaIjxiIjxi+∑j=1F∑j′=1FaIjKj′IjKj′+∑j=1F∑i=1NaKjxiKjxi+attParameter restrictions that need to be imposed for the translation property to hold are:∑j=1FaIj−∑i=1Naxi=−1;∑j=1F∑j′=1FaIjKj′−∑j=1F∑i=1NaKjxi=0;∑j=1FayIj−∑i=1Nayxi=0;−∑i′=1Naxixi′+∑j=1FaIjxi=0,i=1,…,N;∑j′=1FaIjIj′−∑i=1NaIjxi=0,j=1,…,F;and∑n=1C∑j=1FaLnIj−∑n=1C∑i=1NaLnxi=0.Symmetry restrictions are also imposed: aLnLn' = aLn'Ln, aIjIj' = aIj'Ij, axixi' = axi'xi, and aKjKj' = aKj'Kj.Following Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) and Färe et al. (2005), the dynamic quadratic directional input distance function can be estimated using stochastic estimation techniques. The stochastic specification of the distance takes the following form:(A.2)0=D→hi(y,K,L,x,I,t;1,1)+ɛhwhere ɛh= vh− uh,vh∼N(0,σv2)is white noise anduh∼N+(0,σu2). In order to estimate Eq. (A.2), the translation property is used:(A.3)−αh=D→hi(y,K,L,x−αh,I+αh,t;1,1)+ɛhFunctionD→hi(y,K,L,x−αh,I+αh,t;1,1)corresponds to the quadratic form in Eq. (A.1), with αhadded to gross investments and subtracted from variable input quantities. By choosing αhspecific for each firm, variation on the left hand side of Eq. (A.3) is obtained. Following Färe et al. (2005), αhis set equal to I1, which is the normalizing input in determining technical efficiency.33This variable represents gross investment in breeding livestock. Parameter estimates changed very little with the choice of αh however.Dynamic cost inefficiency is obtained by estimating the following cost frontier model, (including a time trend):(A.4)Ch=rW(y,K,L,w2w1,cw1,t)−Wk(y,K,L,w2w1,cw1,t)′K˙−Wt(y,K,L,w2w1,cw1,t)+ξhwhere Ch= (w′x + c′K)/w1 is the observed long-run cost normalized by the variable input pricew1,W(y,K,L,w2w1,cw1,t)is the optimum cost where all input prices have been normalized with respect tow1,Wk(y,K,L,w2w1,cw1,t)andWt(y,K,L,w2w1,cw1,t)are its first derivatives with respect to K and t respectively. The composite error component is specified as ξh= γh+ δh, whereγh∼N(0,σγ2), andδh∼N+(0,σδ2). By normalizing all input prices with respect to w1, W( · ) is specified as:(A.5)W(y,K,L,w2w1,cw1,t)=b0+byy+bw2w2w1+∑j=1Fbcjcjw1+∑j=1FbkjKj+∑n=1CbLnLn+12byyy2+12bw2w2(w2w1)2+12∑j=1F∑j′=1Fbcjcj′cjw1cj′w1+12∑j=1F∑j′=1Fbkjkj′KjKj′+12∑n=1C∑n′=1CbLnLn′LnLn′+byw2yw2w1+∑j=1Fbycjycjw1+∑j=1FbykjyKj+∑n=1CbyLnyLn+∑j=1Fbw2cjw2w1cjw1+∑j=1Fbw2kjw2w1Kj+∑n=1Cbw2Lnw2w1Ln+∑j=1F∑j′=1Fbkjcj′Kjcj′w1+∑j=1F∑n=1CbcjLncjw1Ln+∑j=1F∑n=1CbkjLnKjLn+bttwith the symmetry restrictions bcjcj' = bcj'cj, bkjkj' = bkj'kj, bLnLn' = bLn'Ln, and bkjcj' = bkj'cjimposed.Results of the estimation of the directional distance function and the cost function are presented in Tables A.1and A.2.
