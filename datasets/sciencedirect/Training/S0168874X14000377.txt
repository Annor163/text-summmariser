@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To analyze thin bending plates, a triangular and a quadrilateral element are presented in this paper. These suggested elements are formulated based on the hybrid-Trefftz method. The triangular element is named as THT-15, and it has 6 nodes and 18 degrees of freedom. The quadrilateral element is composed of 8 nodes and 24 degrees of freedom, and it is denoted as QHT-23. Two independent fields are introduced: one within the element and the other on the edges of the element. The internal field satisfies the governing equation of the thin plates. The boundary field is related to the nodal degrees of freedom by shape functions. For better capability, the shape functions of a 3 node Euler–Bernoulli beam are used for each edge of the element. The order of these functions for the deflection, rotation and torsion fields is equal to five, four and two, respectively. By depicting these fields in general coordinates, x–y, shape functions for the elements׳ edges are obtained. Several numerical tests are performed to assess the robustness of the suggested elements. The findings demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed elements in analyzing the thin bending plates.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Thin plate bending is widely utilized in the fields of aerospace, mechanics and civil engineering. These kinds of plates are formulated based on Kirchhoff׳s theory. In this theory, the shear deformation of the element is not considered [1]. The finite element method has been extensively used to analyze thin bending plates. Consequently, various elements have been presented. Some of these elements are formulated by employing Ritz׳s strategy. In this approach, the element׳s degree of freedom and the field function׳s order are enlarged to increase the efficiency of the finite element scheme [2–8]. It is worth emphasizing that the accuracy of this method is not high. In general, continuity does not exist in inter-elements when the aforementioned tactic is deployed. Hybrid functionals are used to formulate some other types of finite elements. In these techniques, the number of master fields is more than one.By introducing independent fields in the interfaces, a hybrid functional can be established. This functional is utilized to create finite elements with high efficiency. Several independent fields are deployed by the hybrid functional. It is worth emphasizing that this functional employs independent boundary displacement fields. Fortunately, the continuity condition is not required to be established in the element׳s boundaries [9]. Pian formulated the first hybrid element for plane stress problems [10]. Prior to using this method in analyzing bending plates, it was employed in solving plane problems. By employing the hybrid functional, extensive research has been performed in the area of solving the bending plates, so far [11–13].The ability of the hybrid formulation in constructing efficient elements resulted in development of hybrid Trefftz (HT) methods. It should be added that independent displacement fields are applied in this technique. To solve various problems in solid mechanics, both Ritz and hybrid-Trefftz techniques can be used. In contrast to Ritz׳s algorithm, the problems׳ governing differential equations are set up by a field function when the hybrid-Trefftz approach is employed. In other words, both homogenous and particular solutions of the governing equations are deployed to formulate the finite element. By using independent boundary displacement field and variational principles, weak forms of the compatibility between elements are obtained in the hybrid-Trefftz method. Note that integration on the boundary of the elements is permissible in this approach. The mentioned characteristic is considered as the main advantage of this technique. Clearly, integration on the boundary is much easier than integration on the surface. In addition, polygon elements can be produced when integration on the boundary is possible. To express the superiority of this approach over the conventional ones, some of its advantages are mentioned below [14]:(1)Continuity exists in the hybrid tactic, and it is not necessary to set up continuity as an additional condition.Without employing a new complex formulation, it is possible to define numerous degrees of freedom on the boundary of the element.The element has high accuracy because of appropriate polynomials, which satisfy the governing equation.The Hybrid-Trefftz formulation was first employed to assess the distorted meshes of the thin plates by Jirousek and Leon in 1970s [15]. This technique soon attracted the attention of other researchers due to its high accuracy and efficiency. The aforementioned approach has been deployed successfully to solve planar problems, thin plates, thick plates, shells and three-dimensional problems [16]. For analysis of thin bending plates, various triangular and quadrilateral elements have been formulated by Jirousek [15–18]. In the aforesaid elements, the p-version tactic has been used. By defining virtual nodes in the middle of the element׳s sides, a boundary displacement field was obtained for the formulation. This procedure was slightly complicated. Rezaiee-Pajand et al. proposed efficient triangular and quadrilateral elements for analysis of the thin plates. In the study, they utilized the interpolation functions of the Euler–Bernoulli Beam with two nodes [19]. In addition, Rezaiee-Pajand and Karkon employed interpolation functions of Timoshenko׳s beam for boundary fields to solve Reissner–Mindlin plates [20]. To analyze these plates, Petrolito presented a quadrilateral element composed of four nodes and a triangular element with three nodes. He used quadratic boundary displacement and linear boundary rotation field [21,22]. Note that higher-order elements, such as quadrilateral elements with eight nodes and triangular elements with six nodes, have high accuracy in coarse meshes. Due to this characteristic, they have received considerable attention. However, these elements have not been employed in the hybrid-Trefftz methods. It should be added that these elements are extensively deployed in other approaches [23–26].In this paper, by employing the hybrid-Trefftz functional, higher-order triangular and quadrilateral elements are presented to analyze the thin bending plates; these elements are composed of six and eight nodes, respectively. The homogenous and particular solutions of the governing equations are deployed to establish the inner displacement field of the elements. It is worth emphasizing that the inner displacement fields are the same in all the elements, which are used for analysis of the thin bending plates. Moreover, boundary interpolation functions relate nodal degrees of freedom to the independent boundary displacement field. In this formulation, the shape functions, of a 3 node Euler–Bernoulli beam, are utilized. The orders of the shape functions for the deflection, rotation and torsion fields are equal to five, four and two, respectively. By depicting the aforesaid fields in general coordinates, x–y, the shape functions of the presented elements׳ edges are obtained. Finally, several numerical tests are performed to investigate the robustness of these elements. The findings prove that the suggested elements are able to calculate the stresses and strains with high level of accuracy. Furthermore, it will be clearly demonstrated that the authors׳ elements are insensitive to mesh distortion.The Hybrid-Trefftz functional with independent inner displacement field (u) and boundary displacement field (u˜) has the following appearance [27]:(1)Π(u,u˜)=∫ΩWudΩ−∫ΩbiuidΩ−∫ΓTT¯iu˜idΓt−∫ΓTi(ui−u˜i)dΓin whichWu,bi,TiandT¯idenote strain energy density function, body force, tractions, and prescribed traction along boundaryΓT, respectively. The inner displacement field (u) which is utilized in this equation should satisfy the governing equation. Moreover,u˜provides compatibility and continuity between elements in the weak form. The inner displacement and tractions can be stated as follows:(2){u}={up}+∑j=1m{ϕj}cj={up}+[Φ]{c}(3){T}={Tp}+[Θ]{c}It should be added that this equality is the sum of a homogenous and a non-homogenous part. In this relation,{up}and[Φ]{c}are particular and homogenous solutions, respectively, of the governing equation. The traction resulting from{up}is demonstrated by{Tp}, and[Θ]{c}denotes the tractions obtained from the homogenous solution of the differential equation. Furthermore, the boundary displacement field is related to the displacement interpolation functions as follows:(4){u˜}=[N˜]{d˜}In this equality, the nodal displacements and boundary interpolation fields are shown by{d˜}and[N˜], respectively. To obtain a stiffness matrix and nodal displacements of the element, the functional (1) should be stationary with respect to the independent fields. For this purpose, the internal strain energy can be written as follows:(5)U=∫ΩWudΩ=12∫ΩσijuεijudΩBy inserting this equality in functional (1), and using integration by parts, the first variation of this functional with respect to internal displacement can be obtained as follows:(6)δΠ(u,u˜)|δu=−∫Ω(σij,j+bi)δuidΩ+∫ΓTiδuidΓ−∫ΓδTi(ui−u˜i)dΓ−∫ΓTiδuidΓIn the hybrid-Trefftz formulation, the internal displacement is selected such that it satisfies the governing equation. Therefore, the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (6) is equal to zero. As a result, the previous relationship will change to the next shape:(7)δΠ(u,u˜)|δu=−∫ΓδTi(ui−u˜i)dΓ=0Furthermore, the first variation of functional (1), with respect to boundary displacement, will have the following form:(8)δΠ(u,u˜)|δu˜=∫ΓTiδu˜idΓ−∫ΓTT¯iδu˜idΓ=0Inserting Eqs. (2)–(4) into Eqs. (7) and (8) leads to the succeeding relations:(9)δ{c}T[{h}+[H]{c}−[G]{d}]=0(10)δ{d}T[{g}+[G]T{c}]=0By deploying relationship (9),{c}can be computed as follows:(11){c}=[H]−1[G]{d}−[H]−1{h}The parameters employed in the Eqs. (9)–(11) are defined in the following form:(12){h}=∫Γ[Θ]T{up}dΓ(13){g}=∫Γ[N˜]T{Tp}dΓ−∫ΓT[N˜]T{T¯}dΓ(14)[H]=∫Γ[Θ]T[ϕ]dΓ(15)[G]=∫Γ[Θ]T[N˜]dΓIt should be noted that matrix[H]is symmetric and nonsingular. The symmetry of matrix[H]follows from virtual work considerations, including Betti׳s reciprocity principle [14]. In the absence of distributed load, using the divergence theorem in Eq. (5), the internal strain energy can be evaluated as follows [18]:(16)U=12∫Γ{T}T{u}dΓ=12∫Γ{u}T{T}dΓBy inserting Eqs. (2) and (3) in the last relation, the internal strain energy will change to the succeeding form:(17)U=12{c}T∫Γ[Θ]T[Φ]dΓ{c}=12{c}T∫Γ[Φ]T[Θ]dΓ{c}=12{c}T[H]{c}=12{c}T[H]T{c}As a consequence,[H]is a symmetric matrix. The details of this proof are given in Appendix B. Substituting Eq. (11) into Eq. (10) results in the following relation:(18){g}−[G]T[H]−1{h}+[G]T[H]−1[G]{d}=0Finally, the stiffness matrix and the nodal forces׳ vector can be computed as the following forms:(19)[K]=[G]T[H]−1[G](20){f}=[G]T[H]−1{h}−{g}These equations can be applied in plane stress problems, bending plates and shells. In this paper, they are employed for analyzing thin bending plates.The governing equation of the thin bending plates has the succeeding shape [28]:(21)∇4w=P(x,y)D(22)∇4w=∂4w∂x4+2∂4w∂x2∂y2+∂4w∂y4(23)D=Et312(1−ν2)where the load applied to the plate and its stiffness are shown byP(x,y)and D, respectively. Since this differential equation is non-homogenous, its solution includes two parts, namely particular and homogenous solutions. These two parts have the subsequent appearance:(24)w=wp+wc=wp+∑j=1mwjcj=wp+[W]{c}(25)∇4wj=0(26)∇4wp=P(x,y)DBy solving∇4wc=0in polar coordinates, the homogenous solution can be computed as follows [29]:(27)wc=∑n=0∞[anrncosnθ+bnrnsinnθ+cnrn+1cos(n−1)θ+dnrn+1sin(n−1)θ](28)wc=∑n=0∞{Re[(an+r2bn)zn]+Im[(cn+r2dn)zn]}The homogenous solutions ((27) and (28)) are valid for any general thin plate, having a wide-range of geometry. In other words, the solution of this equation is independent of domain shape. By utilizingr2=x2+y2andz=x+iy, the functionwjis found in the succeeding forms:(29){w4k=r2Re(zk)w4k+1=r2Im(zk)w4k+2=Re(zk+2)w4k+3=Im(zk+2)k=0,1,2,…A particular solution of the governing equation, without dependence on support conditions, is easily calculated for known loads. For the uniformly distributed loadp0, a particular solution of Eq. (21) is obtained in the below shape [18]:(30)wp=p0r464DFor concentrated load P, the particular solution has the following shape:(31)wp=P16Dπrp2ln(rp2)(32)rp2=(x−xp)2+(y−yp)2In these equalities,(xp,yp)denote the position of the point at which the concentrated load is applied [18].In the particular and homogeneous solutions, there is no advantage over x and y; therefore, the element will be rotational invariant. The minimum of the terms selected from the homogenous solution is dependent on the element׳s number of degrees of freedom. The number of necessary terms (and not sufficient) to preclude numerical instability and deficiency the rank of the stiffness matrix is acquired by employing the following relation [16,18]:(33)m≥NDOF−rIn this equalityNDOFand r denote the number of the element׳s degrees of freedom and rigid body motions, respectively. It should be mentioned that using modes of the rigid body motion produces spurious strain energy in the element. Consequently, these modes should be omitted. The number of modes of rigid body motions in the plate is three, namely a transitive mode and two rotational modes in the direction of x-axis and y-axis. As a result, Eq. (33) can be rewritten for the plates as given below:(34)m≥NDOF−3In general, the minimum number of homogenous solutions, which satisfies the condition of Eq. (34), provides a high level of accuracy for the element [19,20,27]. Therefore, the proposed elements THT-15 with 15 functions and QHT-23 with 23 Trefftz functions are the most accurate elements.Based on the particular and homogenous solutions of differential Eq. (21), the inner displacement field can be stated as having the following shape:(35){u}={wθxθy}={w∂w/∂y−∂w/∂x}={wp∂wp/∂y−∂wp/∂x}+[Φ]{c}According toFig. 1, the tractions{T}can be expressed in terms of shear and bending moment around x- and y-axes as the next form:(36){T}={Sn−Mnx−Mny}={nxQx+nyQy−nxMx−nyMxy−nyMy−nxMxy}={Tp}+[Θ]{c}(37){nx=cosαny=sinαIn thin plates, shear forces and bending moments can be written in terms of deflection functions as follows:(38){Mx=−D(∂2w∂x2+ν∂2w∂y2)My=−D(∂2w∂y2+ν∂2w∂x2)Mxy=−D(1−ν)(∂2w∂x∂y)(39){Qx=−D∂∂x(∇2w)Qy=−D∂∂y(∇2w)The element׳s stiffness matrix and nodal forces can be easily obtained by inserting these relations in Eqs. (19) and (20).The independent boundary displacement is related to the nodal values by interpolation functions. For this purpose, the interpolation functions of the three node Euler–Bernoulli beam which is shown in Fig. (2-1) will be utilized for the boundary of the elements. Then, the aforesaid element׳s interpolation functions are obtained. At first, the beam demonstrated in Fig. (2-2) is deployed. Each node of this element has three degrees of freedom (w,θn,θs). The orders of displacement field w and rotation fieldθnare equal to five and four, respectively. In addition, the torsion fieldθsis a quadratic function. To achieve the interpolation functions of the element׳s sides, firstly, the displacement, rotation and torsion fields should be calculated. Then, the obtained functions should be depicted in general coordinates. The relationship between the displacement field and the rotation field of the beam, shown in Fig. (2-2), is as follows:(40)θ˜n=∂w˜∂s⋅∂s∂Γ=2l⋅∂w˜∂sIn this equality, s denotes the dimensionless coordinate of the length. As a result, the aforesaid fields can be written as the following shape:(41){w˜θ˜n}=[N1N7N2N8N3N9N4N5N6N10N11N12]{wiθniwjθnjwkθnk}(42)N1=14[s2(3s+4)(s−1)2]N2=lij8[s2(s+1)(s−1)2]N3=14[−s2(3s−4)(s+1)2]N4=lij8[s2(s−1)(s+1)2]N5=(s2−1)2N6=l8lij[s(s2−1)2]N7=12lij[s(15s−8)(s2−1)]N8=14[s(s−1)(5s2+s−2)]N9=12lij[−s(15s+8)(s2−1)]N10=14[−s(s+1)(−5s2+s+2)]N11=8lij[s(s2−1)]N12=[5s4−6s2+1]Moreover, the quadratic rotation field (θs) has the succeeding appearance:(43){θ˜s}=[N¯1N¯2N¯3]{θsiθsjθsk}(44)N¯1=12s(s−1)N¯2=12s(s+1)N¯3=(1+s)(1−s)By using the subsequent equation, x and y parameters can be expressed in terms of central coordinate s as given below:(45){xji=xj−xiyji=yj−yix=xi+(s+1)xji/2y=yi+(s+1)yji/2Based onFig. 2, the subsequent results can be achieved:(46){cosα=yji/lijsinα=−xji/lijDepicting the nodal rotations in x–y space leads to the following result:(47){θnm=θxmcosα+θymsinαθsm=θymcosα−θxmsinαm=i,j,kAt this stageθ˜xandθ˜yfields can be written as given below:(48){θ˜x=θ˜ncosα−θ˜ssinαθ˜y=θ˜nsinα+θ˜scosαBy employing the displacement fields (47) and (48) and utilizing Eqs. (41) and (43), the boundary displacement field of the proposed element can be obtained as the following shape:(49){u˜}=[N˜]{d˜}(50){u˜}={w˜θ˜xθ˜y}T(51){d˜}={w˜iθ˜xiθ˜yiw˜jθ˜xjθ˜yjw˜kθ˜xkθ˜yk}T(52)[N˜]=[N11N12N13N14N15N16N17N18N19N21N22N23N24N25N26N27N28N29N31N32N33N34N35N36N37N38N39]All entries of the interpolation functions׳ matrices are presented in Appendix A.In this section, various benchmark problems are presented to investigate the efficiency convergence rate and robustness of the suggested elements. In all these test problems, Poison׳s ratio is assumed to be equal to 0.3. For a comprehensive comparative study, some famous elements from other researchers’ studies are used, which are presented below:Triangular elements:(1)The Discrete Kirchhoff Triangular element (DKT) [30,31].The triangular element of Mindlin׳s discrete plate (DKTM) [32].The triangular element according to Mindlin׳s theory (RDKTM) [33].The triangular element according to Reissner–Mindlin׳s theory (ARS-T9) [34].The triangular 3-node element with 9 Dofs (T3BL) [35].The Hybrid-Trefftz triangular element (T32-7) [27].The triangular element with shear deformable effect (TRI-DRM) [36].Quadrilateral elements:(1)The quadrilateral element of Kirchhoff׳s discrete plate (DKQ) [37,38].The quadrilateral element of Mindlin׳s discrete plate (DKMQ) [39].The quadrilateral element with reduced integration (Q4BL) [40].The Bathe and Dvorkin quadrilateral element (MITC4) [41].The quadrilateral element for Reissner–Mindlin׳s plates (ARS-Q12) [42].The rectangular generalized conforming element with 12 Dofs (RGC-12) [43].The nonconforming quadrilateral element of thin plate with 12 Dofs (ACM) [43,44].The quadrilateral 4-node element (AC-MQ4) [45].The Hybrid-Trefftz quadrilateral element (Q32-11) [27].The quadrilateral element proposed by Auricchio et al. (Q4-LIM) [46].A low order quadrilateral element and enhanced strains (PILTNER) [47].The bending patch test is performed in order to assess the ability of proposed elements to produce the exact constant stresses and curvatures. The geometry of the patch elements is shown inFig. 3. Furthermore, the coordinates of internal nodes are listed inTable 1. The Young׳s modulus ofE=106, Poisson׳s ratio ofν=0.3and thickness oft=1are assumed for the plate. The results of these tests will be presented in the two succeeding sections.The concentrated loads and mesh geometry of this test are shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, boundary conditions of this test are w=0 at nodes 1, 2, and 4. The exact moments, Mx, Myand Mxy, are found equal to a unit everywhere on the plate. The proposed elements, THT-15 and QHT-23, give the exact solutions in this patch test.The mesh from Fig. 3 is used for the constant curvature case, as well. The test is performed by enforcing transverse displacement and rotations on the boundary of the patch as follows:w=10−3(x2+xy+y2),θx=10−3(x+2y),θy=−10−3(2x+y)According to these quantities, the corresponding exact stresses everywhere on the plate should be equal to the following amounts:Mx=My=238.095,Mxy=64.103,Qx=Qy=0In this test, the elements THT-15 and QHT-23 give the exact solutions. Based on numerical experiences, it can be concluded that the presented elements simply pass patch tests.In this section, a square plate is analyzed under two load cases: a uniform distributed load and a concentrated load applied to the center of the plate. The findings including the central deflection and moments of the plates are listed in the following tables.Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate the central deflection and moment, respectively, of the simply supported square plate. The obtained results of the analysis of the square plate with clamped supports are shown inTables 4 and 5. In addition, the square plate is analyzed under concentrated load with simple and clamped supports. Then, the central deflections are listed inTables 6 and 7. The proposed element׳s convergence plot versus the degrees of freedom is presented to prove that these elements are more efficient than other ones (Figs. 4–8). These plots demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of the authors׳ elements, in comparison to other researchers׳ elements.In order to assess the sensitivity of the proposed elements to mesh distortion, two numerical tests are performed. Firstly, a square plate with simple supports is analyzed under a uniform distributed load. Then, the central deflection and moment of a square plate with clamped supports are obtained. In this case, the plate is subjected to a distributed load. To carry out these tests, the distorted mesh shown inFig. 9 is employed for a quarter of the plate. The amount of the mesh׳s distortion parameter is denoted by α. It is worth emphasizing that the selection ofα=0.25leads to regular meshing. Note that other values of this parameter result in distortion. The normalized values of the central deflection and moment of the plate, which is simply supported, are listed inTable 8. In addition,Table 9 demonstrates the normalized values of the central deflection and moment of the plate with clamped supports. According to the findings, it is obvious that these elements are insensitive to distortion. It should be mentioned that the results have high level of accuracy even in the case where poor meshing (α=0.01) is deployed.As is shown inFig. 10, a square plate under doubly sinusoidal load with an intensity ofq=q0sin(πx/a)sin(πb/b)is analyzed. For this load case, the particular solution of the Eq. (21) is as follows:(53)wp=q0π4D((1/a2)+(1/b2))sin(πxa)sin(πyb)It should be mentioned that the analytical solution for a simply supported square plate under this load case is identical to the particular solution [28]. The central deflection and moment of the square plate (b=a), for simple and clamped supports, are given inTables 10 and 11, respectively. The meshes have been used for a whole plate. These tables reveal that the proposed elements have high accuracy and a rapid rate of convergence to the exact solutions. It should be added that for the clamped support case, the analytical solution is not available.A square plate under partially sinusoidal load with an intensity ofq=q0sin(πx/a), which is shown inFig. 11, is studied in this test. By using Levy׳s method, the particular solution of the Eq. (21) for this load case is obtained as follows:(54)wp=q0a4π4Dsin(πxa)To perform this test, a square plate with three different boundary conditions is analyzed and central deflection and moments are obtained. The meshes have been used for the whole plate. The results for simple and clamped supports are shown inTables 12 and 13, respectively. Furthermore, the results of the square plate with two opposite edges simply supported and the other two edges clamped (AD and BC are simply, AB and CD are clamped) are listed inTable 14. The exact solution for this case of the boundary condition is available as [48](55)w=q0a4π4D(1+sinhα1α1+coshα1sinhα1πyasinhπya−α1coshα1+sinhα1α1+coshα1sinhα1coshπya)sinπxaα1=π2These numerical results show that the presented elements are very accurate even for coarse meshes.In this section, an annular plate that is clamped on the outer boundary and is subjected to a uniform load is considered. Due to its symmetry, only a quarter of this plate is analyzed.Fig. 12 shows this plate and its mesh (N=2). Because of the curvature, some errors appear. In this problem, due to the curved geometry and shape of this plate, the geometric error is significant. In general, high-order elements over-constrain the problem on the interpolated clamped boundary more than lower order elements [21]. The maximum displacements and moments of this plate are listed inTable 15. The findings demonstrate the great efficiency of the proposed elements in analyzing this plate. Also, it can be proved that the triangular element, shown by THT-15, is more accurate in comparison to the quadrilateral one, named QHT-23.Razzaque’s skew plate is shown inFig. 13. The sides of this plate are simple on two opposite edges and free on the other two edges. By utilizing the finite difference method, Razzaque has analyzed this plate under a uniform distribute load q=1. Note that he employed a 16×16 mesh. The central deflection and the moment are as given below [49]:(56)w0=0.007945qa4/DMy0=0.09589qa2/DThis structure has been analyzed with different meshes. The obtained results are shown inTables 16 and 17. In addition, in order to make a comparison, the results of other researchers׳ elements are listed in these tables. Based on these tables, it can be deduced that the suggested elements are much more accurate than other elements.Fig. 14 shows error percentages for deflection at the center of Razzaque׳s plate for different elements. It is evident that the suggested elements have high accuracy in solving this severe problem.The analysis of Morley׳s skew plate is considered to be of the most difficult problems [50]. This structure is a simply supported rhombic plate with a skew angle of α=30°. Due to the existence of the acute angle, the deflection of the plate varies rapidly. On the other hand, the rate of convergence to the exact solution is slow. This plate is illustrated inFig. 15.It should be added that the Poisson׳s ratio of this plate is 0.3 and a distribute load q is applied to this plate. In order to impose conditions related to the supports, a soft support and a hard one are deployed. The edges which are parallel to the x-axis have a hard simple support. In other words, deflection and rotation with respect to y-axis are assumed to be zero. Only deflection is prevented in the other edges. The authors׳ elements are utilized to analyze this plate. Besides, the results obtained by other researchers are provided.Table 18 includes the central deflection of the plate obtained using various meshes. Moreover, the maximum and minimum values of the central moment are tabulated inTables 19 and 20, respectively. The results demonstrate the high accuracy of the suggested elements.At this stage, the strain energy of the Morley plate is calculated using the proposed elements. The obtained results are compared with other researchers׳ results. Babuska and Scapolla have solved this problem as a 3D elastic structure. Their responses are considered as referenced values (E=7.304066×10−5p2a6/D) [51]. The normalized strain energy of the Morley plate is listed inTable 21. Based on this table, it is obvious that the presented elements have high accuracy even when coarse meshes are applied.Fig. 16 shows the skew cantilever plate. The analyses of this plate are performed for uniformly distributed loading and for three skew angles, namely β=20°, 40° and 60°. The importance of this study is due to torsion in the plate, as none of the elements proposed by other researchers converge into an analytical solution [52]. The results are demonstrated inTables 22–24. The findings prove that the proposed elements are more accurate than those proposed by other researchers.
