@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In past, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) models desired to find an optimal alternative from numerous feasible alternatives under fuzzy environment. However, researches seldom focused on determination of criteria weights, although they were also important components for FMCDM. In fact, criteria weights can be computed through extending quality function deployment (QFD) under fuzzy environment, i.e. fuzzy quality function deployment (FQFD). By FQFD, customer demanded qualities expressing the opinions of customers and service development capabilities presenting the opinions of experts can be integrated into criteria weights for FMCDM. However, deriving criteria weights in FQFD may be complex and different to multiply two fuzzy numbers in real world. To resolve the tie, we will combine FQFD with relative preference relation on FMCDM problems. With the relative preference relation on fuzzy numbers, it is not necessary multiplying two fuzzy numbers to derive criteria weights in FQFD. Alternatively, adjusted criteria weights will substitute for original criteria weights through relative preference relation. Obviously, adjusted criteria weights are clearly determined and then utilized in FMCDM models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Decision-making is an important issue for business to find an optimal alternative from numerous feasible alternatives. Commonly, decision-making problems with several evaluation criteria belong to multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, such as [2,4,6,7,11,22,27,31,39,40,52,62], and so on. A MCDM problem is shown in following matrix format.(1)and(2)W=W1,W2,…,Wn,where A1, A2, …, Amare feasible alternatives, C1, C2, …, Cnare evaluation criteria, Gijis the rating of Aion Cj, and Wjis the weight of Cj. In MCDM problems, some of them among which evaluation ratings and criteria weights are assessed on imprecision, subjectivity or vagueness belong to fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) problems, such as [12,25,26,28,30,34,46,51,53–55,63,66], and so on. Further, the evaluation ratings and criteria weights are often expressed by linguistic terms [18,24] and converted into fuzzy numbers [68,69]. Based on the concepts, the evaluation ratings may be described by linguistic terms including very poor (VP), poor (P), medium poor (MP), fair (F), medium good (MG), good (G) and very good (VG), and the criteria weights are presented by linguistic terms including very low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H) and very high (VH) in FMCDM problems.In above FMCDM problems, both evaluation criteria and criteria weights are determined by experts (or managers). However, customers’ opinions are often ignored, although some of FMCDM problems concern customer demanded quality aspect such as service performance evaluation, customer relationship management, etc. In fact, fuzzy quality function deployment (FQFD) [8,33,41] can be applied to integrate opinions of experts and customers for identifying evaluation criteria with weights. Further, customer opinions express customer demanded qualities (i.e. quality of FQFD), and expert opinions present service development capabilities (i.e. function of FQFD). Priorities of customer demanded qualities are assessed from customers and expressed by an important level matrix. Then relationships between customer demanded qualities and service development capabilities are derived from experts and presented by a relation matrix. Based on the important level matrix and relation matrix, importance of criteria weights is reasonably identified by quality function deployment (QFD) [5,8,33,41,43,44,48] under certain environment. On the other hand, entries of the important level matrix and relation matrix in FQFD are fuzzy numbers. Thus FQFD may be complex and difficult for combining the important level matrix with relation matrix. For example, we describe Liang's FQFD [41] below.To calculate FQFD, Liang multiplied two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers representing a weighted relationship rating for a customer demanded quality on a service development capability, and the two fuzzy numbers which had been multiplied by extension principle [68,69] will near to a trapezoidal fuzzy number. Then Liang along varied service development capabilities averaged these fuzzy numbers, the averaged fuzzy numbers representing criteria weights of variety service development capabilities were transformed into ranking values through left and right integral values, and a set of criteria weights were ranked according to corresponding ranking values. Obviously, the fuzzy ranking operation of criteria weights is a hard work, such as [1,9,16,17,23,32,37,38,45,47,50,64,67]. To avoid above ties of fuzzy operation, we desire to apply a relative preference relation between fuzzy numbers for FQFD. Further, important levels of customer demanded qualities presenting fuzzy numbers will be substituted for relative preference degrees of the fuzzy numbers over average. Additionally, the relative preference degrees expressing crisp values are combined with fuzzy relationship values for customer demanded qualities on service development capabilities to be fuzzy numbers displaying adjusted criteria weights. The fuzzy adjusted criteria weights over related average are derived to be relative preference degrees by relative preference relation, and adjusted criteria weights are ranked based on their relative preference degrees.For the sake of clarity, related concepts of mathematical theory are presented in Section 2. A relative preference relation on fuzzy numbers is expressed in Section 3. In Section 4, FQFD based on the relation preference relation is proposed to compute adjusted criteria weights of FMCDM problems. Numerical examples constructed on FQFD through the relation preference relation and comparing the FQFD with others are illustrated in Section 5. Finally, conclusions concerning the approach's strengths are expressed in Section 6.In this section, notions of fuzzy sets and fuzzy numbers [68,69] are expressed as follows:Definition 2.1Let U be a universe set. A fuzzy set A of U is defined by a membership function μA(x)→[0, 1], where μA(x), ∀x∈U, denotes the degree of x in A.The α−cut of fuzzy set A is a crisp set(3)Aα={xμA(x)≥α}The support of fuzzy set A is a crisp set(4)Supp(A)={xμA(x)>0}A fuzzy subset A of U is normal iff(5)supx∈UμA(x)=1.A fuzzy subset A of U is convex iff(6)μA(λx+(1−λ)y)≥(μA(x)∧μA(y)),A fuzzy subset A of U is a fuzzy number iff A is both normal and convex.A triangular fuzzy number A in Fig. 1is a fuzzy number with piecewise linear membership function μAdefined byA trapezoidal fuzzy number A in Fig. 2is a fuzzy number with membership function μAdefined byLet ∘ be an operation on real numbers, such as +, −, ∗, ∧and∨, etc. Let A and B be two fuzzy numbers. By extension principle, an extended operation ∘ on fuzzy numbers is defined asA fuzzy preference relation R is a fuzzy subset of ℜ×ℜ with membership function μR(A, B) representing preference degree of fuzzy numbers A over B in [35,36].R is reciprocal iff μR(A, B)=1−μR(B, A) for all fuzzy numbers A and B.R is transitive iff μR(A, B)≥(1/2) and μR(B, C)≥(1/2)⇒μR(A, C)≥(1/2) for all fuzzy numbers A, B and C.R is a fuzzy total ordering relation iff R is both reciprocal and transitive.Based on above definitions, we can express a relative preference relation on fuzzy numbers.To present relative preference relation on fuzzy numbers, related definitions are defined below [68,69].Definition 3.1Let A and B are two fuzzy numbers, where A is in an interval [al, ar] and B is in an interval [bl, br]. A fuzzy preference relation P revised from [35,36,65] is a fuzzy subset of ℜ×ℜ with membership function μP(A, B) representing preference degree of A over B. DefineLet S={X1, X2, …, Xn} denote a set composed of n fuzzy numbers. A fuzzy number Xi=[xil, xir] belongs to the set S, where i=1, 2, …, n. AssumeX¯derived by extension principle is average of the n fuzzy numbers in S. Through Definition 3.1, a relative preference relation P* extended from P with membership functionμP*(Xi,X¯)represents relative preference degree of XioverX¯in S. We defineThe above two definitions can be adopted in general fuzzy numbers. For numerous fields, linguistic terms [18,24] are often converted into triangular fuzzy numbers or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers because the two types of fuzzy numbers are popular in applications. Further, the advantage of triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers with linear membership functions is easily computed, but the disadvantage of them is due to linear membership functions which are difficultly generalized into non-linear membership functions [3,19,20,49,56–61]. Fortunately, important levels of customer demanded qualities and relationships between customer demanded qualities and service development capabilities are assessed by linguistic terms in this paper, and linguistic terms can be converted into triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers as described above. Thus we present rest definitions based on triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.Definition 3.3A and B are two triangular fuzzy numbers if A=(al, ah, au) and B=(bl, bh, bu). Addition ⊕ of the two triangular fuzzy numbers based on extension principle is defined as(12)A⊕B=(al,ah,au)⊕(bl,bh,bu)=(al+bl,ah+bh,au+bu).A and B are two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in case A=(al, ah, ag, au) and B=(bl, bh, bg, bu). Addition ⊕ of the two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers by extension principle is defined as(13)A⊕B=(al,ah,ag,au)⊕(bl,bh,bg,bu)=(al+bl,ah+bh,ag+bg,au+bu).If A=(al, ah, au), multiplication ⊗ of the triangular fuzzy number and real number t through extension principle is defined as(14)t⊗A=t⊗(al,ah,au)=(tal,tah,tau)In case A=(al, ah, ag, au), multiplication ⊗ of the trapezoidal fuzzy number and real number t based on extension principle is defined as(15)t⊗A=t⊗(al,ah,ag,au)=(tal,tah,tag,tau).A and B are two triangular fuzzy numbers if A=(al, ah, au) and B=(bl, bh, bu). A fuzzy preference relation P revised from [35,36,65] is a fuzzy subset of ℜ×ℜ with membership function μP(A, B) representing preference degree of A over B. Define(16)μP(A,B)=12(al−bu)+2(ah−bh)+(au−bl)2T+1,In case A=(al, ah, ag, au) and B=(bl, bh, bg, bu), A and B are two trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The fuzzy preference relation P is a fuzzy subset of ℜ×ℜ with membership function μP(A, B) representing preference degree of A over B. Define(17)μP(A,B)=12(al−bu)+(ah−bg)+(ag−bh)+(au−bl)2T+1,Let S={X1, X2, …, Xn} be a set composed of n triangular fuzzy numbers if Xj=(xjl, xjh, xju)∈S, where j=1, 2, …, n. Through extension principle,X¯=1n⊗(X1⊕X2⊕⋯⊕Xn)=(x¯l,x¯h,x¯u)is assumed to be average of X1, X2, …, Xn. Then a relative preference relation P*, improved from the fuzzy preference relation P of Definition 3.5, with membership functionμP*(Xj,X¯)representing relative preference degree of XjoverX¯in S, where j=1, 2, …, n. We define(18)μP*(Xj,X¯)=12(xjl−x¯u)+2(xjh−x¯h)+(xju−x¯l)2TS+1,Let S={X1, X2, …, Xn} indicate a set consisting of n trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in case Xj=(xjl, xjh, xjg, xju)∈S, where j=1, 2, …, n. By extension principle,X¯=(1/2)⊗(X1⊕X2⊕⋯⊕Xn)=(x¯l,x¯h,x¯g,x¯u)is assumed to be average of X1, X2, …, Xn. Then the relative preference relation P*, improved from the fuzzy preference relation P of Definition 3.6, with membership functionμP*(Xj,X¯)representing relative preference degree of XjoverX¯in S, where j=1, 2, …, n. DefineBesides, S={X1, X2, …, Xn} may be a set composed of triangular fuzzy numbers and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In this situation, triangular fuzzy numbers will be transferred into trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. For instance, (xjl, xjh, xju) presenting a triangular fuzzy number is converted to be (xjl, xjh, xjh, xju). Then S is taken a set consisting of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers into consideration.Lemma 3.1The relative preference relation P* is a total ordering relation [21,35,36,65] on fuzzy numbers.It is obvious that0<μP*(Xj,X¯)<1, where j=1, 2, …, n. Further,μP*(Xj,X¯)<(1/2)expresses thatX¯is preferred to Xj,μP*(Xj,X¯)>(1/2)presents that Xjis preferred toX¯, andμP*(Xj,X¯)=(1/2)displays that Xjis equivalent toX¯. Undoubtedly, X1, X2, …, Xnin S can be ranked according toμP*(Xj,X¯), for j=1, 2, …, n.In this section, FQFD based on relative preference relation is derived to identify adjusted criteria weights of a FMCDM model. To demonstrate the identification clearly, computation steps are expressed in the following.Suppose that D1, D2, …, Dtare customer demanded qualities aggregated by s customers and WD1, WD2, …, WDtare fuzzy important levels of D1, D2, …, Dtin a FMCDM model. Additionally, WDkqis a fuzzy important level of customer demanded quality Dkassessed by qth customer, where k=1, 2, …, t;q=1, 2, …, s. Thus(20)WDk=1s⊗(WDk1⊕WDk2⊕⋯⊕WDks),k=1,2,…,t.Then WD is defined by Eq. (21) to be a fuzzy important level matrix consisting of customer demanded qualities importance, i.e.(21)WD=[WDk]1×t=[WD1,WD2,…,WDt].Let C1, C2, …, Cnbe evaluation criteria representing service development capabilities measured by experts E1, E2, …, Efand W1, W2, …, Wnbe fuzzy weights of C1, C2, …, Cnin the FMCDM model. Moreover, Rkjrepresents fuzzy relationship strength rating for customer demanded quality Dkon service development capability Cj, and Rkjvassessed by expert Evis fuzzy relationship strength rating for customer demanded quality Dkon service development capability Cj, for k=1, 2, …, t; j=1, 2, …, n;v=1,2,…,f. Therefore,(22)Rkj=1f⊗(Rkj1⊕Rkj2⊕⋯⊕Rkjf),k=1,2,…,t;j=1,2,…,n.Then R is assumed to be a relation matrix composed of fuzzy relationship strength ratings for customer demanded qualities on service development capabilities, i.e.(23)In addition, W is a weight matrix consisting of criteria weights W1, W2, …, Wn. Define(24)W=[W1,W2,…,Wn]=1t⊗WD1,WD2,…,WDtR11R12…R1nR21R22…R2n⋮⋮…⋮Rt1Rt2…Rtn,where(25)Wj=1t⊗[WD1,WD2,…,WDt]R1jR2j⋮Rtj=1t⊗(WD1⊗R1j⊕WD2⊗R2j⊕⋯⊕WDt⊗Rtj),forj=1,2,…,nThrough above operations, it is obvious that multiplying two fuzzy numbers and then aggregating multiplied values are essential in general FQFD. However, the computation is a hard work because membership function of multiplying two fuzzy numbers is complex. For instance,WDk=(wdkl,wdkh,wdku)and Rkj=(rkjl, rkjh, rkju) are assumed to be two triangular fuzzy numbers, k=1, 2, …, t; j=1, 2, …, n. By extension principle,(26)WDk⊗Rkj=(Pkj,Qkj,Zkj;Fkj,Tkj;Ukj,Vkj),k=1,2,…,t;j=1,2,…,n.Further, WDk⊗Rkjis a fuzzy number [13–15,42] with membership function defined by Eq. (27) as(27)μWDk⊗Rkj(x)={−Fkj+[Fkj2−4(Pkj−x)Tkj]1/2}2TkjifPkj≤x≤Qkj1ifx=Qkj{Ukj−[Ukj2−4(Zkj−x)Vkj]1/2}2VkjifQkj≤x≤Zkj0otherwise,wherePkj=wdklrkjl,Qkj=wdkhrkjh,Zkj=wdkurkju,Fkj=wdkl(rkjh−rkjl)+rkjl(wdkh−wdkl),Tkj=(wdkh−wdkl)(rkjh−rkjl),Ukj=wdku(rkju−rkjh)+rkju(wdku−wdkh), andVkj=(wdku−wdkh)(rkju−rkjh).Undoubtedly, multiplication of WDkand Rkjis not a triangular fuzzy number. In fact, WDk⊗Rkjapproaches a triangular fuzzy number. The fuzzy numbers aggregation and comparison are too hard to compute. To resolve the computation ties, fuzzy important levels of customer demanded qualities will be substituted for relative preference degrees of the fuzzy important levels over average. First, we assume(28)WD¯=1t⊗(WD1⊕WD2⊕⋯⊕WDt)=(wd¯l,wd¯h,wd¯u)to be average of WD1, WD2, …, WDt. Then the relative preference relation P* with membership functionμP*(WDk,WD¯)representing relative preference degree of WDkoverWD¯is derived by Eq. (29), where k=1, 2, …, t. Define(29)μP*(WDk,WD¯)=12(wdkl−wd¯u)+2(wdkh−wd¯h)+(wdku−wd¯l)2TW+1,whereTW=(twl+−twu−)+2(twh+−twh−)+(twu+−twl−)2iftwl+≥twu−,(twl+−twu−)+2(twh+−twh−)+(twu+−twl−)2+2(twu−−twl+)iftwl+<twu−,twl+=maxk{wdkl},twh+=maxk{wdkh},twu+=maxk{wdku},twl−=mink{wdkl},twh−=mink{wdkh},twu−=mink{wdku}and k=1, 2, …, t.Let W′ be an adjusted weight matrix consisting of adjusted criteria weights W1', W2', …, Wn' based on relative preference degrees of the fuzzy important levels over average. Define(30)W′=W′1,W′2,…,W′n=1t⊗μP*(WD1,WD¯),μP*(WD2,WD¯),...,μP*(WDt,WD¯)R11R12⋯R1nR21R22⋯R2n⋮⋮⋯⋮Rt1Rt2⋯Rtn,where(31)W′j=1t⊗μP*(WD1,WD¯),μP*(WD2,WD¯),…,μP*(WDt,WD¯)R1jR2j⋮Rtj=1t⊗(μP*(WD1,WD¯)⊗R1j⊕μP*(WD2,WD¯)⊗R2j⊕⋯⊕μP*(WDt,WD¯)⊗Rtj),j=1,2,...,nSinceμP*(WDk,WD¯)is a crisp value and Rkjis a triangular fuzzy number, Wj' is a triangular fuzzy number, where k=1, 2, …, t. LetWj'=(wjl',wjh',wju'), for j=1, 2, …, n. Assume(32)W¯′=1n⊗(W′1⊕W′2⊕⋯⊕W′n)=(w¯′l,w¯′h,w¯′u)to be average ofW′1,W′2,…,W′n. Then the relative preference relation P* with membership functionμP*(Wj',W¯')representing relative preference degree ofW′joverW¯′is obtained by Eq. (33), where j=1, 2, …, n. Define(33)μP*(W′j,W¯′)=12(w′jl−w¯′u+2(w′jh−w¯′h)+(w′ju−w¯′u)2TW′+1,whereTW′=(tw'l+−tw'u−)+2(tw'h+−tw'h−)+(tw'u+−tw'l−)2iftw′l+≥tw'u−,(tw'l+−tw'u−)+2(tw'h+−tw'h−)+(tw'u+−tw'l−)2+2(tw'u−−tw'l+)iftw′l+<tw′u−,tw'l+=maxj{wjl'},tw'h+=maxj{wjh'},tw'u+=maxj{wjh'},tw'l−=minj{wjl'},tw'h−=minj{wjh'},tw'u−=minj{wju'}and j=1, 2, …, n.Obviously,W′1,W′2,…,W′nsubstitute for W1, W2, …, Wn, and priorities of criteria C1, C2, …, Cnare sorted byμP*(W′1,W¯′),μP*(W′2,W¯′),…,μP*(W′n,W¯′). By FQFD based relative preference relation, priorities of criteria are quickly and simply derived. In addition, adjusted criteria weights are identified through FQFD and the relative preference relation. Likewise, the computation of adjusted criteria weights for customer demanded qualities and service development capabilities being presented by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is as similar as above, so it is omitted.Based on above, we aggregate all computation concerning adjusted criteria weights and show the deriving procedure in Fig. 3.Assume that a bank desires to evaluate a given credit card for potential customers. Based on the idea, the bank has to derive evaluation criteria and criteria weights before evaluating the credit card. In the evaluation problem, convenience (D1), repayment (D2) and safeness (D3) are customer demanded qualities collected from potential customers through factor analysis [29] and WD1, WD2, WD3 assessed by 30 representative customers are fuzzy importance levels of D1, D2, D3 in the FMCDM model. The 30 customers through linguistic terms set {very low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H), very high (VH)} measure importance levels of D1, D2, D3. These linguistic evaluation terms and corresponding fuzzy numbers are expressed in Table 1. Then linguistic assessment result and fuzzy importance levels of customer demanded qualities obtained based on entries of Table 1 are shown in Table 2.Through entries of Table 2, average of fuzzy importance levels of customer demanded qualities is derived by Eq. (28), i.e.WD¯=(0.47,0.71,0.88). Then relative preference degrees of fuzzy importance levels of customer demanded qualities over average computed by Eq. (29) are presented in Table 3, and priorities of three customer demanded qualities ranked by the relative preference degrees are also expressed in Table 3.Additionally, fame (C1), function (C2), credit (C3), promotion (C4), fees (C5) and image (C6) are service development capabilities employed by experts and W1, W2, …, W6 derived by the experts are fuzzy weights of C1, C2, …, C6 in the FMCDM model. To obtain related fuzzy weights W1, W2, …, W6, linguistic relationship assessments for three customer demanded qualities including convenience, repayment and safeness on six service development capabilities concerning fame, function, credit, promotion, fees and image are respectively presented in Tables 4–6. The three tables are assessed by 10 experts through linguistic terms set {very low (VL), low (L), medium (M), high (H), very high (VH)} as well. Then fuzzy relationship strength ratings for three customer demanded qualities on six service development capabilities, which are also transferred based on entries of Table 1, are respectively presented in Tables 4–6.Through entries of Tables 4–6, a fuzzy relation matrix for three customer demanded qualities on six service development capabilities is presented in Table 7. Then an adjusted weight matrix composed of six adjusted weights based on entries of Tables 3 and 7 is derived by Eq. (30) in Table 8.According to entries of Table 8, average of six adjusted weights is computed by Eq. (32), i.e.W¯'=(0.484,0.768,1.035). Then relative preference degrees of adjusted weights of service development capabilities over average derived by Eq. (33) are expressed in Table 9, and priorities of service development capabilities sorted by the relative preference degrees are shown in Table 9 as well.To demonstrate proposed FQFD feasibility and rationality, we compare the FQFD with Liang's FQFD in his example [41]. In Liang's FQFD, importance levels of customer quality needs (i.e. customer demanded qualities) and average are presented in Table 10.By Eq. (29), relative preference degrees of important levels of customer quality needs over average are calculated in Table 11, and priorities of customer quality needs is also presented in the table. Obviously, the ordering is the same as Liang's ranking result.In addition, Liang's fuzzy relation matrix for customer quality needs on service management requirements (i.e. service development capabilities) is presented in Table 12. Then adjusted weight matrix based on entries of Tables 11 and 12 derived by Eq. (30) is expressed in Table 13.Based on entries of Table 13, we obtain average of adjusted weights of service management requirements to be (0.536, 0.836, 1.053, 1.310) by Eq. (32). Then relative preference degrees of adjusted weights of service management requirements over average and priorities of service management requirements computed by Eq. (33) are expressed in Table 14.Undoubtedly, the sorting result is as similar as Liang's ranking result. Although weight orderings of on-line analysis processing and create the culture of CRM in the two computations are different. This is due to two fuzzy weight ratings concerning on-line analysis processing and create the culture of CRM are similar. For instance, adjusted weights of on-line analysis processing and create the culture of CRM are respectively (0.588, 0.888, 1.058, 1.320) and (0.542, 0.842, 1.071, 1.351) by proposed FQFD, and weight ratings of on-line analysis processing and create the culture of CRM presented by (0.20, 0.42, 0.50, 0.76; 2.29, 0.04; 5.50, 0.03) and (0.19, 0.40, 0.51, 0.78; 2.21, 0.04; 5.18, 0.03) near to trapezoidal fuzzy numbers in Liang's FQFD. Additionally, we compare (0.20, 0.42, 0.50, 0.76; 2.29, 0.04; 5.50, 0.03) with (0.19, 0.40, 0.51, 0.78; 2.21, 0.04; 5.18, 0.03) through Chen's method called graded mean integration representation [10]. The method is defined below. Let G=(P, Q, Y, Z;F, T;U, V) present the fuzzy number approaching a trapezoidal fuzzy number. Then utility representation value by Chen's graded mean integration representation is defined as Ut(G)=(1/6)(P+2Q+2Y+Z). Through Chen's graded mean integration representation, utility representation value of (0.20, 0.42, 0.50, 0.76; 2.29, 0.04; 5.50, 0.03) is (1/6)(0.20+2×0.42+2×0.50+0.76)=0.467, and utility representation value of (0.19, 0.40, 0.51, 0.78; 2.21, 0.04; 5.18, 0.03) is (1/6)(0.19+2×0.40+2×0.51+0.78)=0.465. Obviously, the two utility representation values of weight ratings computed by Chen's graded mean integration representation method are very approximate, and the former is higher than the later. The sorting situation is the same as ours. In fact, the ordering difference is from fuzzy numbers specification, so it may be ignored.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we associate FQFD with relative preference relation to identify adjusted criteria weights in a FMCDM model. Through relative preference relation, priorities of customer demanded qualities represented by relative preference degrees of customer demanded qualities over related average are quickly derived. Additionally, the relative preference degrees of customer demanded qualities over related average are utilized to combine customer demanded qualities with service development capabilities in fuzzy relation matrix between the two for obtaining adjusted criteria weights. By the adjusted criteria weights, we can avoid multiplying triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, aggregating multiplied fuzzy numbers, and ranking them. Further, the sorting situation computed by relative preference relation is similar to ranking result calculated by multiplying fuzzy numbers. Besides, time complexity on fuzzy operation is O(n) to derive adjusted criteria weights by relative preference relation P*. Since P* with membership function represents relative preference degrees of n fuzzy numbers over average, adjusted criteria weights are easily calculated according to the relative preference relation. On the other hand, time complexity on fuzzy operation will be O(n2) when n fuzzy numbers are fuzzy pair-wise computed (i.e. fuzzy operation number beingC2n=(n(n−1))/2). In fact, the main differences of general fuzzy pair-wise computations and P* are range composed of fuzzy numbers, and comparison basis. Undoubtedly, P* has strength which fuzzy pair-wise fuzzy pair-wise computations have, but no weakness of fuzzy pair-wise computations. Obviously, applying relative preference relation in FQFD for criteria weighting is useful because the computation is easy and fuzzy numbers multiplied will be unnecessary.
