The effect of Finite Word Length (FWL) is considered to show the implementation difficulties of controller in digital processors. Simulation results demonstrated that CMA-ES based fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controller is suitable for real time implementation with good robust stability and performance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Modern industries have been demanded a robust controller for the need of safe and reliable closed loop system [1]. A robust controller delivers a stable closed loop system even under uncertain environment while satisfying the performance specifications (i.e., Risetime, Settling Time, ITAE, etc.). In 1960s, Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller was successfully used in the industries, but it was not able to give guaranteed robustness [2]. Hereafter, in 1980s, H∞ controller synthesis was very popular for designing robust controller for both Single Input Single Output (SISO) and Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) systems [3]. But, this iterative method loses some important system dynamics due to pole zero cancellation [4]. In order to overcome the pole zero cancellation, H∞ loop shaping method was proposed for designing robust controller [5–9]. In this method, two pre and post compensators (i.e., weights) are used to represent performance specifications and measurement noise respectively. The controller is designed based on the stability and performance information in the weights. However, this method gives higher order controller which makes difficult in controller implementation in digital processors. Also, this method does not support re-tuning in the designed controller in case of plant model changes [10]. To overcome these drawbacks, fixed structure controller has been preferred for industrial applications [11].Many research works have been proposed for designing fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controllers. Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach was extensively applied in fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controllers [12–14]. However, these LMI approaches require clear understanding of robust control theory and Semi Definite Programming (SDP). Due to this, it may not be easy for most engineers to employ these LMI approaches [15]. Also, LMI solver gives only local optimal solution for non-convex, disconnected parameter space fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controller design problem [16]. To overcome the limitations of LMI approaches, evolutionary computing (EC) techniques are very popular in solving the non-convex, non-smooth, multi-modal and badly scaled problems [17]. Many, EC techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) [18,19], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [20,21] and Heuristic Kalman Algorithm (HKA) [16], Hybrid PSO [22] are used for designing the fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controller.The methods discussed above focus on the maximization of stability margin as an objective and the performance specifications are represented in the pre-tuned weights. However, tuning of the weights is not an easy task [23]. It is tuned based on performance specifications as well stability conditions. But, the performance and stability are conflicting with each other. Due to this, a time consuming trial and error method is required for tuning the weights.This paper proposes a new problem formulation by incorporating a performance requirement as a constraint in the fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controller design problem. From the proposed formulation, the weights can be tuned only based on stability conditions and the desired performance can be obtained using the constraint. Also, in this disconnected surface problem, the performance requirement constraint helps to find the better stability margin than the existing work of [16,18].Co-variance Matrix Adaptation-Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) [24–27] is used to validate the proposed problem. Recently, in EC literature, it is reported that CMA-ES has better efficiency in solving different kind of engineering problems due to its self learning behavior as compared to other ECs [28–34]. The CMA-ES based fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controller is compared with the traditional H∞ loop shaping controller, non-smooth optimization and HKA based fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controllers. The statistical performance of the algorithms such as CMA-ES, non-smooth optimization algorithm and HKA are compared in terms of giving consistent solutions. The implementation difficulties of higher order controllers are also discussed.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses H∞ loop shaping robust controller design. Section 3 describes the Co-variance Matrix Evolutionary Strategy. Section 4 describes the steps for designing CMA-ES based fixed structure H∞ loop shaping Controller. Section 5 discusses the simulation results. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 6.Robust control is concerned to design a stabilizing controller that achieves desired feedback performance in terms of stability and accuracy against plant uncertainty, parameter variations and external disturbances.A standard robust controller synthesis and analysis are done in the unified Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) framework as shown in Fig. 1.Large number of robust control design methods have been developed over the past decades including Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller [35], H∞ optimization method [3], H2/H∞ Mixed Sensitivity [36], μ-Synthesis [37], etc., Among these robust controller design methods, H∞ loop shaping method [5] has the advantages as follows: (i) no restriction on the number of right-half plane poles (ii) no pole-zero cancellations occur between the nominal model and controller (iii) no problem dependent weight selection. Also, this method has the systematic procedure to handle the stability margin constraints for MIMO systems. Moreover, H∞ loop shaping controller has been successfully implemented in many industries [7–9]. This interesting and efficient method is illustrated in the following section.H∞ loop shaping method was developed by McFarlane and Glover. Loop shaping concept is used to shape singular values of the nominal plant so as to give the desired open loop properties at low and high frequencies. The desired responsiveness and noise suppression properties are described by weighing the plant transfer function in the frequency domain [23]. The design of H∞ loop shaping controller has the following steps.1.Shaping the singular values of the nominal system using selected weights.Designing the stabilizing controller which satisfies robust stabilization condition.H∞ loop shaping method inherits the properties of conventional loop shaping and incorporates it in H∞ synthesis [23].(a)Weight selectionUsing a pre compensator W1, and post compensator W2, the nominal system G is modified to give a desired loop shaped system, Gs=W2GW1. Let the shaped plant is represented by the state space of the form as shown in Eq. (1),(1)Gs(s)=ABCDMaximum achievable stability margin (ɛmax) is determined by using Eq. (2) suggested by Glover and McFarlane [5].(2)εmax=(1+λmax(ZX))−12where, λmax is the maximum Eigen value of ZX. Z and X are the unique positive definite solutions of algebraic Ricatti equation [5,23]. The weights are adjusted based on ɛmax as in Eq. (2). If margin is too small, ɛmax≪0.25, i.e. the specified loop shape is incompatible, then weights are readjusted until ɛmax>0.25 is met [23].After the desired loop shape is achieved, the shaped plant is represented by left (or right) co-prime factors of the plant with no poles in the closed right-half complex plane, such that.(b)The shaped plant (Gs) is represented in Eq. (3)Let matrices(M˜s,N˜s)∈H∞+where,H∞+denotes there is no pole in closed right half complex plane.(3)Gs=W2GW1=M˜s−1N˜sMsis square and det(Ms)≠0(4)M˜sM˜s*+N˜sN˜s*=Ithere exist(V˜s,Us)∈˜H∞+such that(5)M˜sV˜s+N˜sU˜s=IFig. 2shows the shaped plant in terms of Normalized Co-prime Factorization and described in Eq. (6).(6)Gs=(Ns+ΔNs)(Ms+ΔMs)−1where,ΔNsandΔMsare stable and unknown, representing the uncertainty and satisfyingΔNs,ΔMs∞<ε. By using small gain theorem, the robust stabilizing controller which satisfies if and only if(7)K∞(I−GsK∞)−1M˜s−1(I−GsK∞)−1M˜s−1∞≤ε−1The stabilizing controller can be synthesized by maximizing the stability margin (ɛ) as in Eq. (8)(8)IK∞(I−GsK∞)−1M˜s−1<1ε=:γwhere, K∞is the stabilizing controller, Gsis the shaped plant,M˜s−1is the normalized left co-prime factor of the plant Gsand stability margin is denoted as ɛ.Then a sub-optimal central controller is synthesized [5] from the set of all stabilizing controllers, that achieves ɛ<ɛmax is given in Eq. (9)(9)K∞=A+BF+γ2(LT)−1ZCT(C+DF)γ2(LT)−1ZCTBTX−DTwhere,F=−S(DTC+BTX)L=(1−γ2)I+XZThe controller K∞is synthesized to ensure the robust stability of the closed-loop system. If the stability margin (ɛ), ɛ>0.25 then the controller design is usually successful. In this case, at least 25% of uncertainty is allowed i.e. the shape of open loop singular values will not change under uncertainty [23]. The final controller K is of the form(10)K=W1K∞W2The realized controller structure from H∞loop shaping method has higher order which will increase the implementation difficulties due to hardware limitations in the real world. Additionally, model reduction methods are used to reduce the controller order which also increases the mathematical complexity of the controller design problem. Thus, a fixed structure controller with good robust stability and performance is preferred for the practical implementation point of view [12–14,18–22].By introducing the pre-fixed controller structure in the traditional H∞loop shaping framework, it is possible to design a fixed structure H∞loop shaping controller to overcome the complexity of higher order H∞loop shaping controllers [5,12–14]. This fixed structure controller retains all the benefits of traditional H∞loop shaping controller design [12]. Let the fixed structure of the controller is denoted as Kfixed(s, x), where, x∈Rnis the solution vector which contains the controller parameters, n is the number of controller parameters. By fixing the final controller K as Kfixed(s, x), then Eq. (10) becomes as follows:(11)Kfixed(s,x)=W1K∞W2(12)K∞=W1−1Kfixed(s,x)W2−1The strategy of fixed structure controller in Eq. (12) is substituted in Eq. (8) and the stability margin (ɛ) for the fixed structure controller is evaluated as given in Eq. (13).(13)f(x)=ε=IW1−1Kfixed(s,x)W2−1(I−GsW1−1Kfixed(s,x)W2−2)−1Ms−1∞−1The maximization of the function f(x) is taken as an objective for the design of fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controller. This method allows specifying the performance requirement as a constraint with the objective. For performance requirement, Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) is used as a constraint. Then, the design of fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controller is formulated as an optimization problem as follows:(14)maxf(x)s.tg1(x)=∫te(t)dt<PDxli≤xi≤xui;i=1,…,nwhere, PDis the required ITAE performance, xliand xuiare the lower and upper bounds of the search space S≔{x∈Rn|xli≤xi≤xui};i=1, …, n. The CMA-ES finds the design parameters by maximizing the objective function while satisfying the performance constraint as in Eq. (14).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, fixed structure H∞ loop shaping robust controller is designed for Pneumatic servo system, separating tower process and super maneuverable F18 fighter aircraft system using CMA-ES. ITAE performance constraint is incorporated in the fixed structure H∞ loop shaping robust controller design problem. Simulation results clearly show that addition of performance requirement constraint helps CMA-ES to find the optimal controller with better stability margin by reducing the feasible search space. Also, it reduces the difficulty of weight selection in the fixed structure H∞ loop shaping controller design. Statistical results show that CMA-ES gives better stability margin and consistency than GA, HKA and non-smooth optimization algorithms. Moreover, CMA-ES designed controllers have good robustness despite 20% perturbations in the plant. In addition, the effect of Finite Word Length reveals that the CMA-ES based fixed structure controller has less difficulty than higher order controller in digital processor implementation. Hence, CMA-ES designed fixed structure controller is suitable for real time implementation with simple structure and has good robust stability.
