@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper examines the application of binary integration to X-band maritime surveillance radar, with a view to enhancing detection performance. The clutter is assumed to follow a Pareto distribution, since this model has been validated for high resolution X-band maritime clutter returns. The binary integration process is based upon an order statistic detection scheme, which has the constant false alarm rate property with respect to the Pareto shape parameter. An optimisation procedure is outlined, which results in ideal choices for the binary integration factor and the order statistic index. Performance of the resultant detection process is analysed, with homogeneous and heterogeneous simulated clutter, whose parameters are matched to those obtained from real clutter data sets. A direct application to real data is also included.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Binary integration is a suboptimal incoherent detection process, which has a simple receiver implementation, while potentially improving detection performance [1]. The technique was introduced in [2], and then further refined to include optimal choices for integration parameters [3]. The process of binary integration involves examining a series of univariate detection processes, and integration of the detection results by declaring a target present if at least a predetermined minimum number of hits is exceeded. If the univariate detection processes have the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property, with respect to clutter parameters, then the binary integrated detection process will also preserve this property. The development and applications of binary integration to target detection in various clutter environments can be found in [4–10].In this work, binary integration is applied with order statistic (OS) CFAR detectors, designed to operate in Pareto distributed clutter [11]. The motivation for analysing OS-CFAR is that it has the potential to manage interference very well. The Pareto clutter model is used because it has been validated for high resolution X-band maritime surveillance radar clutter returns, independent of the grazing angle [12,13]. Additionally, the Pareto model is a member of the class of the amplitude (or intensity) models associated with compound Gaussian processes and hence it fits the currently accepted clutter model characteristics [14,15].A new technique for CFAR development based upon the Pareto clutter assumption can be found in [16], with extensions reported in [17] and [18]. The approach used is to transform CFAR processes designed for Gaussian intensity clutter, to operate in Pareto distributed clutter. As a consequence of this, the Gaussian probability of false alarm (Pfa) and threshold multiplier relationship is preserved. The new detectors depend explicitly on the Pareto scale parameter. However, there are new algorithms that allow efficient estimation of it in practice [19]. Hence it will be assumed throughout this work that this parameter is completely known.This paper will establish how one can optimise the choice of OS-CFAR and the binary integration parameter, so as to maximise detection performance in X-band high resolution radar clutter. By accounting for an expected number of interfering targets, an optimal choice for the OS-CFAR index is outlined. Additionally, by applying methods as in [20], the optimal number of pulses to integrate can be determined. This is done with respect to Swerling target models in Pareto distributed clutter. However, some rules of thumb can be established, relative to the clutter's polarisation, on the best choice for binary integration parameters in general.Throughout this work Pareto clutter parameters, for simulated data, have been based upon estimates taken from real data sets. This is Defence Science and Technology Organisation's (DSTO) Ingara data, which is a series of X-band high resolution medium to high grazing angle maritime surveillance pure clutter returns. The Ingara radar has been discussed in a number of publications [21,22]. The data obtained, and modelled by a Pareto distribution in intensity, has been discussed extensively in [13,23,24]. The radar is fully polarimetric, and operated in a circular spotlight mode, obtaining clutter measurements in the full 360° of azimuth angles. Included in the numerical analysis is an application to target detection when a synthetic target is embedded within the real data sets. This will give an indication of the relative merits of binary integration with OS-CFAR.The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the mathematical preliminaries, while Section 3 discusses optimisation of detection process parameters. Section 4 illustrates the performance of binary integration in homogeneous Pareto distributed clutter. The effect of interfering targets in the CFAR range profile is then examined in Section 5. False alarm regulation is considered in Section 6, where the effect of clutter power changes on the design Pfa is analysed. Finally, Section 7 examines the binary integration process applied to high resolution X-band maritime surveillance radar clutter returns collected by DSTO. Due to the absence of a target in the data, synthetic Swerling target models are inserted. This allows the construction of detection performance curves, giving an indication of real detector performance.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A binary integration detection process, coupled with an OS-CFAR detector, was introduced and optimal selection of detection parameters were discussed. This integration scheme was then shown to work well with Swerling targets in homogeneous clutter. When interference was included in the clutter range profile, there was an inevitable detection loss, which was managed by appropriate selection of the OS index. It was also demonstrated that during clutter transitions, the design Pfa could be better regulated in the case of horizontally polarised clutter. With vertical polarisation, there was an unacceptable deviation from the design Pfa. These results suggest that it is more appropriate to perform detection in the horizontally polarised case, to preserve the CFAR property.In view of this, an application where a Swerling target was embedded directly into the Ingara data, was considered, for horizontal polarisation. Despite the breakdown in design principles, the binary integration process showed very good performance in the real data. Finally, it was shown that binary integration based upon a Pareto clutter model assumption worked better than that based upon a Weibull model, for the Ingara data. This is attributed to the way in which the CFAR scheme is designed for the Pareto clutter model assumption.By the definition of the Gamma function,(28)Γ(N+τ+1)=(N+τ)(N+τ−1)…(N+τ−(k−1))Γ(N+τ−(k−1)),which when applied to (4), together with a logarithmic transformation, results in(29)−log⁡(N+τ)−log⁡(N+τ−1)−⋯−log⁡(N+τ−(k−1))=log⁡((N−k)!N!)+log⁡(Pfa).Viewing the threshold multiplier as a function of the Pfa, one can differentiate (29) to obtain(30)dτdPfa=−Pfa−1[1N+τ+⋯+1N+τ−(k−1)]<0,which demonstrates that τ is a decreasing function of the Pfa, as required.To begin, consider the case whereS=1. Then for binary integration to introduce gains, we requireθ1<θ2and1−(1−θ1)M>θ2. For convenience defineϕ1:=1−θ1andϕ2:=1−θ2. Consequently, one requiresϕ2<ϕ1andϕ2>ϕ1M. Observe that over the interval[0,1], the functiong(ϕ)=ϕMis convex forM>1. Hence, these conditions can always be met, and so binary integration will always provide detection performance improvements whenS=1. This condition parallels the example considered previously, whereθ1=θ2.Note that ifM=1the conditions above can never be met. To investigate this further, it is clear that whenS=M,(31)P(Bin(M,θ1)=M)=θ1M<θ2M<θ2implying (15) can never hold, and thus binary integration will never yield improvements in detection performance. This result also parallels that for the case whereθ1=θ2.For the scenario where2≤S≤M−1, the analysis becomes more involved. However, the key to it is related to the convexity property mentioned in theS=1case. One requiresθ1<θ2and(32)∑j=SM(Mj)θ1j(1−θ1)M−j>θ2.Applying the definitions ofϕ1andϕ2as used previously, then it is immediate that (32) is equivalent to(33)∑j=0S−1(Mj)(1−ϕ1)jϕ1M−j<ϕ2,with the requirement thatϕ1>ϕ2. Hence define a function h on the unit interval by(34)h(θ):=∑j=0S−1(Mj)(1−θ)jθM−j.Binary integration will provide an improvement in performance if the function h is convex in subsets of the unit interval. Hence an analysis of its derivatives is required. Firstly, observe thath(0)=0andh(1)=1. By an application of differentiation, one can establish that(35)h′(θ)=(M−M2)θM−1+(M2−M)θM−2+∑j=2S−1(Mj)[−j(1−θ)j−1θM−j+(M−j)(1−θ)jθM−j−1].Observe that the derivative (35) is zero atθ=1, implying a stationary point.By a second application of differentiation to (35), one can arrive at the second derivative(36)h″(θ)=12(M−1)2M(M−2)θM−2+M(M−1)(M−2)θM−3+M(M−1)∑j=3S−1(Mj)(1−θ)j−2θM−j∑j=2S−1(Mj)(1−θ)j−2θM−j−2(M−j)(M−j−1−2(M−j)θ).Since the function h is twice differentiable, it follows that it will be convex providedh″(θ)>0. Inspection of (36) shows that this will occur provided(M−j)(M−j−1−2(M−j)θ)>0. Sincej<Mwe requireM−j−1−2(M−j)θ)>0. Consequently it follows that(37)θ<1−1M−j<1−1M−1,for allj>1, establishing an upper bound on the convexity limit point. Hence, the function h is convex provided the condition (37) holds.This can now be applied to establish when binary integration can provide detection performance gains. Recalling that we requireϕ2<ϕ1andϕ2>h(ϕ1), this will occur in the region of convexity of h, and so when0<ϕ1<1−1M−1. Relating this back to the originalθ1, it requiresθ1<1M−1.Suppose for a fixed OS parameter k,τkis the corresponding threshold multiplier, so is given by inversion of (4). Letτk+1be the threshold multiplier for the(k+1)thOS-CFAR, and hence is given by inversion of(38)Pfa=N!(N−k−1)!Γ(N−k+τk+1)Γ(N+τk+1+1).Then based upon (4),τkis the solution to(39)Γ(N+τk+1)Γ(N+τk−k)=(N−k+τk)N!(N−k)!Pfa−1>N!(N−k−1)!Pfa−1,due to the fact thatτk>0. Hence the threshold multiplierτkis the solution to (4) that also satisfies the inequality in (39). Next, consider the threshold multiplierτk+1. The ratio of Gamma functions in (4) and (39) can be written as a function of x as(40)Γ(N+x+1)Γ(N+x−k)=(N+x)(N+x−1)(N+x−2)…(N+x−k):=γk(x),and so is a polynomial of degreek+1. Since the threshold multiplier is nonnegative, it follows thatγkis increasing on[0,∞). Since, for fixed k,τk+1is the solution toγk(τk+1)=N!(N−k−1)!Pfa−1, andτkis the root of (4) which occurs whenγk(τk)>N!(N−k−1)!Pfa−1, it follows from simple geometry thatτk+1<τk, implying the threshold multiplier is decreasing with k, as required.
