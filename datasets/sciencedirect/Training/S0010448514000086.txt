Obtaining a spiral path for machining STL surfaces using non-deterministic techniques and spherical tool

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Machining STL surfaces, without a volume inside, is useful and it can be optimized.To optimize this process we use the piece contour, defining 2D spiral paths.With non-deterministic techniques, the third coordinate of the tool-path is obtained.This method was simulated and applied to a workpiece, with positive results.Its precision was tested using confocal microscopy and coordinate-measuring machine.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Preparation of tool-paths for sculptured surfaces is still being an interesting research aspect, since obtaining the interval between consecutive milling passes attending to the surface curvature  [1], which can be defined in several ways, such as segmenting using polygons  [2], being triangles the most commonly used. This is how differential geometry is replaced by analytic geometry of line and plane.Deciding the optimal path for milling is still a problem in which research keeps being useful  [3]. Previous researchers have dealt with the more convenient cutting direction for sculptured parts  [4], paying attention to the surface roughness and required milling time. Nevertheless, among all the possible milling strategies (zigzag,z-level, parallel plan, iso-planar, etc.), spiral paths seem to be the most commonly used ones  [5]. The reason for this is, basically, that this kind of paths leaves no machining marks on the surface.The definition of milling tool-paths for finishing free form surfaces can be also decided according to several curve models, e.g.B-splines. This curve model can be applied in fields like the shoe manufacturing, for example usingB-splines to compensate radiuses in the machining of shoe lasts  [6], or to make the shoe sole attending to 3D CAD profile curves, scaling for different sizes  [7]. Therefore, linear interpolation trajectories (G01) should not be forgotten, as they keep providing good results, combined with smoothing features included in numeric control devices  [8] and a correct subdivision of the curves used to define the tool-path. Although it is possible to generate a 2D spiral trajectory with biarcs and splines  [9], in this case G01 has been applied because it fits properly to 3D tool-paths and smoothing functions in numeric control devices, thus obtaining continuous trajectories.Productivity can also be enhanced when continuous arcs are applied to define the tool-path as described in the previous research [10], being necessary to define parallel sections to interpolate those arcs, while in 3D it is necessary to indicate the interpolation plane, making this method slower.For studying the error in the milling results with a spherical tool tip  [11], as a result of roughness and dimensional tolerance, the surface representation must be taken into account. This representation can be considered using NURBS  [12] or STL  [13]. In this research article, STL surfaces were applied.After deciding the surface representation, the milling strategy is chosen according to quality and time parameters. For example, Lu et al.  [14] obtained spiral tool-paths from conventional trajectories, although they applied a process of incremental sheet forming (ISF) instead of milling. Other researchers  [15] have optimized tool-paths, using response surface method for single point ISF. Similarly, spiral tool-paths for machining sculptured surfaces have also been obtained by conformal map approach  [16].Considering a maximumΔzis equivalent to use thezcoordinate as a fuzzy parameter  [17]. In this paper,Δzis treated as a variable to reduce processing times.To calculate any coordinate (x,yorz) of the tool-path position in the space, geometric-analytical methods are usually applied, using fuzzy techniques only for the analysis of cutting parameters related to the part finishing, such as roughness  [18]. Furthermore, Lo  [19] studied the effect of feed rate, cutting speed and depth as roughness causes. Non-deterministic techniques have also been successfully applied to change cutting conditions  [20] during the machining process or, on the contrary, to adapt this process to its specific conditions, predicting its final features  [21]. In a similar way, these techniques have been combined with the Taguchi method and genetic algorithms  [22].The presented method makes possible to develop spiral trajectories, where coordinatesxandyare obtained from the part boundary. This part’s surface is given in STL format, making possible to export and import from virtually any commercial 3D CAD. To obtain the third coordinate,z, an approximation based on non-deterministic techniques is used with a margin of tolerance.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
With the algorithms presented it is possible to mill STL surfaces, Figs. 22 and 23, providing that they comply with certain conditions, thereby obtaining regular profiles and with a quality of finish very close to that required.The dimensional results (Fig. 24) are within the programmed margin of error for this piece (0.05 mm), providing enough quality for manufacturing different custom-made objects, such as the cycle saddle shown in this example or different types of ergonomic components, among other applications.The measurement path was obtained from the points used in the milling process of the workpiece, but increasing their separation, i.e., decreasing the number of points (Fig. 25). The points were collected in a spreadsheet and, after that, exported to CAD to compare them with the nominal surface. In order to evaluate the results, the surface was cut into longitudinal and transversal sections.The spherical cavities were used to position the horizontal plane of reference and to orientate the coordinate axes, as shown in Fig. 25. A longitudinal nominal profile is represented in Fig. 26, which also includes its measured profile, obtained by a linear interpolation of the measurement spiral points. The deviation in the measured points has always been smaller than the chosen tolerance value of 0.05 mm.As shown in Table 2, the presented algorithm generates tool-paths with a length that makes possible to improve the machining time compared with commercial CAM packages.Finally, the surface roughness was measured using confocal microscopy, obtaining the results shown in Fig. 27. These results displayed a maximum roughness below the programmed value, 20 μm in this case, in both the wide and the narrow areas of the piece.
