@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Set Covering Problem (SCP) isNP-hard. We propose a new Row Weighting Local Search (RWLS) algorithm for solving the unicost variant of the SCP, i.e., USCPs where the costs of all sets are identical. RWLS is a heuristic algorithm that has three major components united in its local search framework: (1) a weighting scheme, which updates the weights of uncovered elements to prevent convergence to local optima, (2) tabu strategies to avoid possible cycles during the search, and (3) a timestamp method to break ties when prioritizing sets. RWLS has been evaluated on a large number of problem instances from the OR-Library and compared with other approaches. It is able to find all the best known solutions (BKS) and improve 14 of them, although requiring a higher computational effort on several instances. RWLS is especially effective on the combinatorial OR-Library instances and can improve the best known solution to the hardest instance CYC11 considerably. RWLS is conceptually simple and has no instance-dependent parameters, which makes it a practical and easy-to-use USCP solver.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The Set Covering Problem (SCP) is a combinatorial optimization problem with many applications, ranging from crew scheduling in railways to job assignment in manufacturing and service location (Bautista & Pereira, 2006; Caprara, Fischetti, Toth, Vigo, & Guida, 1997). It can be described as follows: given a set of elements X, a setS={s|s⊆X}and⋃s∈Ss=X,where each subset in S is associated with a cost, and the goal is to find a set F ⊆ S whose union is X (which contains all elements from X) at the minimal total cost. If all subsets in S have identical cost, the problem is referred to as the unicost set covering problem (USCP). Although being a special case of SCP, the unicost version is generally considered to be even harder to solve (Yelbay, Birbil, & Bülbül, 2015) and is the subject of this paper.Formally, an SCP instance is usually defined as an m × n zero-one matrixA={aij}m×nwhereaij=1means column (set) j can cover row (element) i. The objective is to find a set of columns at the minimal cost to cover all rows. If the problem is a USCP, the objective is equivalent to finding the smallest set of columns that cover all rows. A candidate solution C can then be represented as a subset ofN={1,…,n}. Such a solution is feasible if and only if∑j∈Caij≥1,∀i∈M={1,…,m}.In this paper, we propose a stochastic Row Weighting Local Search (RWLS) algorithm for solving USCPs. RWLS uses two search operators to perturb the candidate solution and combines three major existing strategies into its local search procedure:(1)a weighting scheme, which updates the weights of the uncovered rows in order to escape from local optima,different tabu strategies, which prevent possible cycles during the search, anda timestamp method to break ties, which makes the sets that are not moved into or out of the candidate solution for a long time are more likely to be selected.In our experimental studies, RWLS has improved 14 best known solutions in the literature for 87 USCP benchmark instances from the OR-Library (Beasley, 1990b) and shown excellent performance. It is especially effective on the problems where the number of rows (elements) is much larger than the number of columns (sets). However, RWLS is also effective in other cases, for example, for the seven railway crew scheduling instances, with up to millions of columns and thousands of rows. Combining a problem size reduction technique from solving Lagrangian Relaxation, although RWLS obtains inferior results to a sophisticated algorithm (Yagiura, Kishida, & Ibaraki, 2006) from the literature for this set of railway crew scheduling instances, it still outperforms CPLEX12.511CPLEX is an optimization software package from IBM: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.5.1/maps/ic-homepage.html.consistently and succeeds in finding good solutions to all seven instances while CPLEX12.5 failed on four larger instances. Overall, RWLS is simple, efficient, and only needs a single parameter to indicate the stopping criterion.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first discuss related work in Section 2 and then give a detailed description of RWLS in Section 3. The experimental studies are presented in Section 4 and compared with several approaches from the related work. Conclusions and future work are finally given in Section 5.
