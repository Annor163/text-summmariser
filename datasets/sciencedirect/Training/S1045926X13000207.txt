@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We are investigating information analysis as a kind of problem solving in which teams are presented with a collection of facts regarding people, places and events, and then identify underlying connections, patterns, and plans in order to draw specific conclusions. The teams spontaneously created a variety of artifacts to hold and organize problem information, and practices to simplify and regularize their collaborative interactions around these artifacts. In this paper, we analyze the artifacts and practices as a potential source of insight into how this problem solving activity could be supported by an interactive system design.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
When people work in complex environments, they support their own intellectual activity by designing artifacts to hold and organize problem domain information and practices to simplify and regularize interactions. For example, people create descriptive names for their personal files and, in managing file systems, they develop file naming schemas to guide and facilitate the generation of new filenames, and to enhance subsequent retrieval and recognition interactions with files and filenames [5]. This is a simple example of distributed cognition: People creatively shape and leverage the external world to be a more effective resource for their own subsequent activity [22].Spontaneous ad hoc designs are of course not necessarily optimal designs, or even good designs. Non-designers often inappropriately reuse existing designs [21]. Command languages that users designed to operate robots were used effectively by those users, but the user-designed command languages often incorporated linguistic properties known to evoke command language performance problems for people generally [5].We are investigating information analysis as a kind of problem solving in which teams are presented with a wide array of information regarding people, places and events, and must try to identify underlying connections, patterns, and plans. This is a difficult area to work in because practitioners are often specifically inaccessible to the public because of the security classification of the problem content they address. In a field study of information analysts in the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA, but at that time called the National Imagery and Mapping Agency) only a few participants could be identified, each was only able to devote a couple hours to the study, and all had to be interviewed by proxy, since our team did not have appropriate security clearance to talk to them [27].We created a reference task[35] involving 222 facts pertaining to a set of campus crimes involving stolen laptop computers. We observed teams of three students working to identify suspects, to develop theories of the crimes, and to predict the next likely crime in the series. In addition to problem information, we provided the teams with standard office supplies. Most teams used these physical materials to create ad hoc information artifacts in the course of working on the problem.In this paper, we describe the artifacts that were spontaneously created, and then consider these ad hoc designs as expressions of tool requirements for this problem solving activity. We use this analysis of the artifacts and practices of the student teams to guide a requirements analysis for the design of an interactive system to support the information analysis task. This is analogous to our earlier investigation of emergency management planning [6,28], which we subsequently used to design and evaluate interactive system support for that activity [18].
