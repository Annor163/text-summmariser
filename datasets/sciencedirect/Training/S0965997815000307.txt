@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This article discusses the applicability of the three-parameter Kozeny–Carman generalized equation to trigger immiscible viscous fingers and describe it in fractal heterogeneous porous media, during numerical simulations of waterflood operations in oil reservoirs. For that purpose, for the first time this equation was incorporated into a model that describes immiscible flows of incompressible two-phase fluids in porous media. Results were generated from intensive simulations, and viscous fingers were visualized graphically for three different well patterns, typical of oil fields: Line-Drive, Five-Spot and Inverted Five-Spot. Such results suggest that this generalization of the Kozeny–Carman equation can be used in numerical simulations of oil recovery processes susceptible to hydrodynamic instability phenomena.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
During a secondary petroleum recovery process, conducted under water injection, the formation of immiscible viscous fingering in the oil reservoir is the product of an interfacial instability phenomenon that occurs in porous media, when the oil (the high-viscosity fluid) is displaced by the water (the low-viscosity fluid). In the presence of this instability phenomenon, part of the invading water advances through the porous medium at velocities much higher than those of the average front, bypassing the oil and rapidly approaching the production wells [3]. Thus, the appearance of such immiscible viscous fingers can cause considerable problems for the oil industry, due to poor recovery of hydrocarbons during a waterflood process.Hence, appropriate phenomenological models, stability analyses of immiscible flows and numerical simulators able to capture the formation of immiscible viscous fingers are very useful tools, not only to predict the viscous fingering but also to assist in the proposal of a possible stabilization process of this phenomenon of hydrodynamic nature, which has (over the past several decades) attracted the attention of many researchers [5,6,8,10,13,17,19,20,22,23].Studies that discuss the formation of viscous fingers during surfactant injection in heavy oil reservoirs, in the presence and absence of polymers, can be found in the recent works by Yadali Jamaloei et al. [28–32].In an oil reservoir, when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one, immiscible viscous fingers are triggered primarily by natural geologic heterogeneities, such as the heterogeneities of the real permeability field. In numerical simulation, there are two basic approaches to trigger viscous fingers: (a) small perturbations of the front at timet=0, commonly used in the simulation of flows in homogeneous media, and (b) the effective use of a mathematical model to describe (even in an approximate way) the heterogeneity of the porous material [10]. In the second case, the communities working with reservoir simulations often use synthetic permeability fields, generated randomly from a log-normal distribution with a specified variance [12,18].Recently, Henderson and co-authors proposed the so-called three-parameter Kozeny–Carman generalized (TPKCG) equation [15], which was used in the modeling of heterogeneous permeability fields. More specifically, the TPKCG equation was developed to allow the use of a Kozeny–Carman type model to a broad class of porous media with fractal nature, generalizing various models previously reported in the literature, which commonly are employed to describe specific porous media, including oil reservoirs with fractal heterogeneities.The objective of this work is to verify the ability of the TPKCG equation to trigger immiscible viscous fingers and describe it in a fractal porous medium during numerical simulations of waterflood operations, with adverse mobility ratios. For this, we consider a two-dimensional rectangular porous medium having a random porosity field, with porosity values uniformly distributed in a given interval. Then, the absolute permeability of the porous material is modeled as a function of the porosity, using the TPKCG equation. This approach yields a heterogeneous permeability field, whose fractal nature is described by this mathematical model equipped with three fixed parameters. Assuming this rectangular heterogeneous porous medium as the oil reservoir, in order to observe the effects of well locations on the geometric structure of the viscous fingering, we present results of flows of two immiscible incompressible fluids (water and oil) using three flooding patterns [11], Line-Drive, Five-Spot and Inverted Five-Spot.Fingering phenomena also can be observed in miscible flows in porous media [9,14,16,25–27]. However, as noted by King et al. [20] the instability of an immiscible flow it is more difficult to model numerically than a miscible flood. In fact, as emphasized by these authors, in an immiscible fingering the so-called Buckley–Leverett mixing zone leads to enhanced stability compared to the corresponding miscible flood. Accordingly, the choice of the present immiscible process incorporates an additional challenge to the use of the TPKCG equation.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the characterization of the porous medium via the TPKCG equation. Section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the mathematical model for immiscible incompressible fluid flows in porous media. In Section 4, we summarize the numerical methods. In Section 5, we report the results. The conclusions are given in Section 6.The characterization of porous materials using a Kozeny–Carman type equation necessarily considers the existence of a functional relationship of the form [3](1)k=fϕ,where ϕ, the porosity of the material, is the fraction of the bulk volume of the porous medium occupied by voids, and k, the permeability of the material, is the property that determines the ease with which a fluid may be made to flow through the porous medium. In Eq. (1), f summarizes the model used, which generally is a nonlinear function of ϕ, such thatfϕ=0ifϕ=0.The TPKCG equation models fractal structures, which are characterized by the existence of fundamental properties between the specific surface(Mb)and the portion of the bulk volume occupied by solid matrix1-ϕ, and between the tortuosity(τ)and the porosityϕ, whereMbis defined as the interstitial surface area of the pores per unit of bulk volume of a representative sample of the material, and τ is the ratio of flow-path length to sample-path length. Its formulation assumes that [15]:(1)The reciprocal of the specific surface admits the fractal scale law(2)1Mb=C1/Mb1-ϕ-D1/Mb,whereC1/MbandD1/Mbare, respectively, the fractal coefficient and the fractal exponent of1/Mb.The tortuosity is described by the fractal scale law(3)τ=Cτϕ-Dτ,whereCτandDτare the fractal coefficient and fractal exponent of τ, respectively.The porous medium can be modeled as a bundle of n capillary tubes non-necessarily of circular cross-sections, where the flow in this bundle of hydraulic tubes is described by an extension of Hagen–Poiseuille law [3](4)q=nfvRh4μΔPLh.In Eq. (4)q is the fluid flow rate in volume per unit time, μ is the viscosity of the fluid,ΔPis the applied pressure difference across the length of the tubes,RhandLhdenote the hydraulic radius and length of the mean hydraulic tube, andfvis a shape factor of volume of the tubes.The hydraulic radius obeys the relation(5)Rh=ϕMb.As stated by Henderson et al. [15], such conditions lead to the TPKCG equation, which can be written in the following short form below(6)k=ξ2ϕζ+31-ϕ2η.In Eq. (6), the three fractal parametersξ,ζand η depend on the fractal coefficients and fractal exponents described in Eqs. (2) and (3), and on the ratiofs/fv, wherefsis a shape factor of area of the tubes. The parameters ζ and η are dimensionless quantities, while the parameter ξ has length dimension.By fitting the model in Eq. (6) to experimental data available in the literature, Henderson et al. [15] were able to prove the potential of the TPKCG equation to describe the permeability–porosity relationships of many natural and industrial materials, including sandstones.In order to study the formation of viscous fingering, here we consider a two-dimensional heterogeneous porous medium of fractal nature generated from the TPKCG equation, where the three parameters are given byξ2=4darcy(4.053μm2),ζ=1.5andη=0.002, and the porosity is determined randomly from an uniform distribution on the interval[0.2,0.4]. As shown in Fig. 1, this choice results in a heterogeneous porous medium where the permeability varies roughly between 0.0028 and 0.0648 darcy (0.002837 and 0.065659μm2).In this section, we present the mathematical model used to describe the immiscible flow of an invading fluid (water) plus a resident fluid (oil), which flow together as incompressible two-phase fluids in a porous medium, where the water is considered the wetting phase, while the oil is the nonwetting phase. This flow is described by the mass conservation equations for the wetting phase and for the two-phase fluid, and by Darcy’s law for the phase velocities.In what follows, S denotes the saturation of the wetting phase (the portion of pore volume filled with water), and P is the pressure of the nonwetting phase (oil). The constantsμwandμnare the viscosities of the phases, where “w” and “n” indicate the wetting and non-wetting phases, respectively. The phase mobility functions,λwandλn, are defined by(7)λw=krwμw,(8)λn=krnμn,wherekrw=krw(S)andkrn=krn(S)are the relative permeabilities of the respective phases, which vary with S.Disregarding gravity effects, the model equations can be summarized in the following forms [7],(9)∇·u=q,(10)u=-kλ∇P-λw∇Pc,(11)ϕ∂S∂t+∇·uw=Sq,(12)uw=fwu+kfwλnPc′∇S.Eq. (9) is the law of conservation of mass for the incompressible two-phase fluid, where u denotes the called total velocity and q is the source (or sink) term. In Eq. (10),λ=λw+λnis total mobility, and(13)PcS=P-Pw,is the capillary pressure (a function ofS), wherePwdenotes the pressure of the wetting phase. Eq. (11) describes the conservation of mass of the wetting phase, where t is the time, anduwis the velocity of this phase. In Eq. (12),fw=λw/λis the fractional flow of wetting phase, which can be written as(14)fwS=MkrwSkrnS+MkrwS,whereM=μn/μwis the called mobility ratio.LetΩ⊂R2be the two-dimensional spatial domain representing the (supposedly horizontal) porous medium shown in Fig. 1, whose boundary is denoted by∂Ω. The boundary conditions are those that describe the absence of flows in the borders of Ω:(15)u·ν=0,at∂Ω,for allt⩾0,(16)uw·ν=0,at∂Ω,for allt⩾0,where ν is the unit vector normal to∂Ω. The initial condition has the form:(17)S=S0,for all point ofΩ,att=0.Considering a two-dimensional total velocity field of the typeu=uxi+uyj(whereiandjare the unit vectors in x-direction and y-direction, respectively), and replacing Eq. (12) in Eq. (11), we obtain the so-called saturation equation(18)ϕ∂S∂t=-∂fwux∂x-∂fwuy∂y-∂∂xDS∂S∂x-∂∂yDS∂S∂y+Sq,where(19)DS=kfwλnPc′.Eq. (18) is a partial differential equation of the type convection–diffusion, whereD(S)denotes a diffusion coefficient due to capillary pressure.The rectangular domainΩwill be denoted byΩ=0,Lx×[0,Ly], whereLxandLyare the lengths of the sides of this rectangular region in x-direction and y-direction, respectively. For the spatial discretization, we use a uniform block-centered grid. Given two integersnxandny, this grid will be described byΩ^=xi,yj∈R2;i=1,…,nxandj=1,…,ny, withxi=i-1/2Δxandyj=j-1/2Δy, such thatΔx=Lx/nxandΔy=Ly/ny. Each pointxi,yj∈Ω^represents a node of the block-centered grid, where the values of the unknown functions of the problem in question are effectively calculated. Givenxi+1/2=xi+Δx/2,yj-1/2=yj-Δy/2, etc., the setΩ^ij=xi-1/2,xi+1/2×yj-1/2,yj+1/2denotes a block ofΩ^, whose node is the pointxi,yj. Thus, we havenx×nydiscretization blocks.The temporal domain is represented by a closed intervalt0,tf, wheretfis the final time andt0(=0)is the initial time. Given an integernt, this interval will be partitioned in the form0=t0<t1<⋯<tn<⋯<tnt=tf, providing a temporal grid, where a time step is denoted byΔtn+1=tn+1-tn, for alln=0,…,nt-1. Following the traditional notation,fi,jndenotes the value of a function fat the nodexi,yj∈Ω^, at the level of timetn.We use a time-marching approach based on an improved IMPES (implicit pressure and explicit saturation) time stepping strategy [7]. Thus, we discretize Eq. (18) in the following form(20)dSi,jn+1dt=-1ϕi,jGi,jn,where(21)Gi,jn=fwi+1/2,jnuxi+1/2,jn-fwi-1/2,jnuxi-1/2,jnΔx+fwi,j+1/2nuyi,j+1/2n-fwi,j-1/2nuyi,j-1/2nΔy+1ΔxDi+1/2,jnSi+1,jn-Si,jnΔx-Di-1/2,jnSi,jn-Si-1,jnΔx+1ΔyDi,j+1/2nSi,j+1n-Si,jnΔy-Di,j-1/2nSi,jn-Si,j-1nΔy-Si,jnQi,jnΔxΔy.Here, to avoid non-physical oscillations and excessive artificial numerical dispersions, in Eq. (21) the fractional flow of wetting phase(fw), on each edge of a block of the block-centered grid, is approximated using a flux limiting scheme taken in the upstream direction [4]. On the other hand, the diffusive terms are approximated by arithmetic averages, for example,Di+1/2,jn=(Di+1,jn+Di,jn)/2.The velocities are approximated using centered finite differences. For example,(22)uxi+1/2,jn=-kλi+1/2,jnPi+1,jn-Pi,jnΔx+kλwi+1/2,jnPci+1,jn-Pci,jnΔx,wherekλi+1/2,jnandkλwi+1/2,jnare calculated by harmonic average, i. e.,(23)kλi+1/2,jn=2kλi,jnkλi+1,jnkλi,jn+kλi+1,jn.Note thatQi,jn, at the last term on the right side of Eq. (21), has dimension of area per unit time. This term, that represents the flow rate of fluid injected into (or produced from) the two-dimensional porous medium, is associated withqi,jnby the following relation:(24)Qi,jn=qi,jnΔxΔy.According to the improved IMPES method [7], the saturation equation (Eq. (20)) is solved at each time step given by(25)Δtn+1=ΔSmaxMax1⩽i⩽nx1⩽j⩽ny1ϕi,jGi,jn;for alln=0,…,nt-1,whereΔSmax>0is a sufficiently small number chosen to ensure the numerical stability of the used explicit scheme. In present work, Eq. (20) is solved using the fourth order Runge–Kutta method [2].The spatial derivatives in Eq. (9) are approximated by centered finite differences. Thus, we obtain the discretized form of the so-called pressure equation:(26)uxi+1/2,jn-uxi-1/2,jnΔx+uyi,j+1/2n-uyi,j-1/2nΔy-Qi,jnΔxΔy=0,where the velocities are approximated as shown in Eq. (22). GivenSi,jn, fori=1,…,nxandj=1,…,ny, Eq. (26) is the scheme used to calculate the pressure values at grid nodes. Following the original IMPES method [1], this pressure equation is implicitly resolved at each time level.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Many porous materials (where the permeability is presented as a function of porosity) can be characterized by the Kozeny–Carman equation. In order to overcome some limitations of this classical equation, recently the present authors developed the TPKCG (three-parameter Kozeny–Carman generalized) equation. The TPKCG equation is a new permeability–porosity relationship that has proved to be appropriate to allow the use of a Kozeny–Carman type model to a broad class of porous media with fractal nature, including oil reservoirs.Viscous fingers are interfacial instability phenomena that occur in porous media, when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one. Customarily, such a phenomenon takes place in oil reservoirs during waterflood operations, causing considerable damage to the oil industry. Thus, in the last several decades, employing different approaches several researchers have studied the occurrence and/or stabilization of viscous fingering. Among the approaches commonly used are the direct simulations, which are carried out using numerical solutions of the partial differential equations that describe the evolution of viscous flows in porous media, along with the characterization of the porous material from a possible geostatistical model for the permeability field, which is essential to trigger viscous fingers in simulations of flows in heterogeneous porous media.In this study the TPKCG equation was used to trigger immiscible viscous fingers and describe it in a fractal porous medium during simulations of waterflood operations. Thus, for the first time, the TPKCG equation was incorporated into a model that describes immiscible flows of incompressible two-phase fluids in porous media, formed by nonlinear differential equations. Then, this difficult problem was successfully solved using accurate numerical methods based on an improved implicit pressure and explicit saturation (IMPES) strategy.Numerical results were generated from intensive simulations, and viscous fingers were visualized graphically for three different well patterns: Line-Drive, Five-Spot and Inverted Five-Spot.Our results, which constituted the major challenges of this work, show that the TPKCG equation is a mathematical model able to describe viscous fingering in simulation of immiscible flows of incompressible fluids in heterogeneous porous media.These results motivate us to indicate the TPKCG equation as a theoretical tool to be used in numerical simulations of oil recovery processes, including those susceptible to hydrodynamic instability phenomena.
