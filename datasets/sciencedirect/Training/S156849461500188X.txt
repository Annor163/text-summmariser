@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
A dynamic strategy for screening of ASD is proposed based on patterns of information flow between 8 brain regions.The EEG data is collected from 12 healthy and 6 autistic children in the age of 7 to10 years old.The subjects are then classified as autistic or healthy based on the connectivity features.The connectivity features are also compared with other established methods.The promising recognition rates of ≥93% were achieved in this study.This study shows that patterns of functional and effective connectivity in ASD subjects are different from healthy subjects.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this study, a dynamic screening strategy is proposed to discriminate subjects with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) from healthy controls. The ASD is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder that disrupts normal patterns of connectivity between the brain regions. Therefore, the potential use of such abnormality for autism screening is investigated. The connectivity patterns are estimated from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from 8 brain regions under various mental states. The EEG data of 12 healthy controls and 6 autistic children (age matched in 7–10) were collected during eyes-open and eyes-close resting states as well as when subjects were exposed to affective faces (happy, sad and calm). Subsequently, the subjects were classified as autistic or healthy groups based on their brain connectivity patterns using pattern recognition techniques. Performance of the proposed system in each mental state is separately evaluated. The results present higher recognition rates using functional connectivity features when compared against other existing feature extraction methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Autism spectrum disorder is defined as a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with deficits in executive function, language, social interaction and lack of interests and repetitive behaviour [1]. Although symptoms of autism vary across different categories but all individuals have difficulties in social interaction such as the use of eye contact and responding to emotional cues. Some basic deficits such as lack of attention and failure to orient the names, often appear within the 1st year of life [2] while other malfunctions such as deficits in social interaction, imitation, responding to the others’ emotional cues, and face recognition are often manifested later on, within age 2 to 3 [3–8]. Many of the social deficits in autism occur due to the inability to perceive and process information from faces [9]. These deficits are not typically diagnosed until about the age 3 [10]. Although, the neural structure for face processing is normally specialized at very early stage of life [9,11,12]. Considering these facts, early signs of abnormal brain development (structure and functions responsible for face processing) can potentially be used for the purpose of autism screening.Numerous approaches are used to investigate the brain structure and function including Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magneto-encephalography (MEG), Electroencephalography (EEG) and Position Emission Topography (PET) [13–20]. Although the spatial resolutions of PET and fMRI are better compared to the EEG and MEG however EEG and MEG are both superior in terms of temporal resolution. In addition, EEG is a portable device, is easy to integrate with other devices and the operational cost of running EEG is much cheaper than other devices. Therefore, EEG is used in this study to screen changes in patterns in the functional connectivity of autistic children. Recent studies have indicated that autistic patients mostly have thinner calcium channels in their neural systems [21]. This fact can reduce functional connections within the local neural architectures and changes the global patterns as well [17,22,23]. Such alterations of the brain functional and structural connectome in ASD subjects have been indicated in neuroimaging studies [20,24–28]. In general, it is suggested that ASDs show reduced long-distance connectivity [26] and enhanced local connectivity [24,29]. Despite growing evidence of functional connectivity dysfunction in ASD, few studies have applied these findings for screening purpose [27]. Screening can be performed in different mental states [18,30]; however, it is still largely unknown that alterations of FCs in which mental state produce more discriminative features between ASDs and HCs. In this study, changes in patterns of functional connectivity in autistic children are investigated in various mental states. Investigation is performed based on EEG data gathered from 8 brain regions while subjects are exposed to different emotional faces as well as during eyes-closed and eyes-open resting states. The pattern recognition techniques are then applied to categorise the subjects based on their functional connectivity patterns. Functional connectivity is estimated using several techniques including Magnitude Squared Coherence Estimation (MSCE) [31], Directed transfer function (DTF) [32], Partial Direct Coherence (PDC) [33] and Phase Slope Index (PSI) [34]. Subsequently, these features are applied to classify the subjects as autistic or healthy groups. The supervised types of learning mechanism used are K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) [35], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [36], Naive Bayesian (NB) [37] and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) [38] classifiers. Consequently, the performance of the classifiers in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity are compared. The connectivity based features are also compared against other existing feature extraction methods. Similar procedure is also applied to both resting (eyes-close and eyes-open) and emotional (calm, happy, and sad) states.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related studies. Section 3 describes the experimental design. Section 4 presents the methodology employed in the proposed EEG-based system. Section 5 presents experimental results and Section 6 concludes the paper.During the face processing task, ASD subjects focus more on others’ people mouths instead of getting the information from mouth and eyes [39]. This atypical strategy for scanning of subject face leads to loss of vital information of the subject facial emotion [40]. Several investigators have proposed that ASD subjects have abnormal connectivity in the brain regions, particularly related to amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus, fusiform face area and orbitofrontal cortex [41]. Such abnormalities have been investigated in numerous research efforts using fMRI, PET, DTI and EEG [13–16]. Studies have also reported that faces evoke a distinct pattern of electrical activity in the brain which can be precisely traced by EEG signals. Studies have shown that abnormal face processing strategies can be revealed by EEG signatures such as Event Related Potential (ERP) markers including N170, P300, N400, EEG power and coherence patterns [42–44]. Such studies have indicated that the neural system for face processing is disrupted by age 3 in autistic children and persists into adulthood. The face processing system can be disrupted either in the encoding (perception) or in the representation (expression) stages. In autistic children, perception of emotional faces is impaired, hence, the speed of processing a stimulus is decreased [40]. This may be due to changes in the brain's functional and effective structure which has been shown using EEG studies [45]. Increase in the theta band coherence between the left frontal and temporal regions and decrease in the lower alpha band coherence between frontal region and other parts of the brain have been reported in ASD. It has also been indicated that phase lock duration is significantly longer in the upper alpha band (10–12Hz) and shorter in the lower alpha band (8–10Hz) in ASD subjects [46]. It should be noted that alpha band phase lock contributes to the generation of ERPs [47] and this correlates with the IQ level [48].Based on previous studies, functional connectivity features can potentially be a strong indicator for use in screening autistic subjects. In this study, the experimental protocol and methodology for the extraction of these features and screening procedure using these features are explained as follows in next sections.
