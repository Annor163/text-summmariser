@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Analyzing the acceleration photoplethysmogram (APG) is becoming increasingly important for diagnosis. However, processing an APG signal is challenging, especially if the goal is to detect its small components (c, d, and e waves). Accurate detection of c, d, and e waves is an important first step for any clinical analysis of APG signals. In this paper, a novel algorithm that can detect c, d, and e waves simultaneously in APG signals of healthy subjects that have low amplitude waves, contain fast rhythm heart beats, and suffer from non-stationary effects was developed. The performance of the proposed method was tested on 27 records collected during rest, resulting in 97.39% sensitivity and 99.82% positive predictivity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The pulse wave analysis provides more precise information concerning blood pressure changes than systolic and diastolic pressures only [1]. It is a valuable method to assess aortic stiffness and elasticity [2–4], and to evaluate the vascular effects of aging, hypertension, and atherosclerosis [5–8]. Photoplethysmography (pulse oximeter) is the most common device used to measure pulse waves, which illuminates the skin and measures changes in light absorption. The measured signal has been referred to as photoplethysmogram (PTG/PPG) and digital volume pulse (DVP); however, the acronym PPG will be used exclusively within this study, according to the recommendations in [9]. Fingertip PPG mainly reflects the pulsatile volume changes in the finger arterioles, as shown in Fig. 1.For more accurate recognition of the inflection points and easier interpretation of the pulse wave, the second derivative of the original plethysmogram wave was introduced [10]. The acronym of the second derivative PPG is SDPPG or APG; however, the acronym APG will be used exclusively in this study, according to the recommendations in [9].As shown in Fig. 1, the waveform of the APG consists of four systolic waves (a, b, c, and d waves) and one diastolic wave (e wave) [11]. The height of each wave was measured from the baseline, with the values above the baseline being positive and those under it negative. The relative heights of these waves (b/a, c/a, d/a, and e/a ratios), particularly the c/a ratio has been related to arterial stiffness and aging [7,12] and essential hypertension [13]. All these ratios were used in calculating the ‘ageing index’ (b−c−d−e)/a[7]. Recently, the detection of a waves in APG signals has been used to calculate heart rate [14–16] and heart rate variability indexes [17,18]. Moreover, Homma et al. [19] categorized the APG into seven types depending on the waveforms. The clinical description of these categories has been demonstrated in Fig. 2.Although the clinical significance of APG measurement has been well investigated, there is still a lack of studies focusing on the automatic detection of c, d and e waves in APG signals. However, there was an attempt by Matsuyama [20] to determine which of the nine QRS algorithms of Friesen's ECG algorithms [21] suits the detection of a waves in APG signals. However, up to the present, there has been no attempt to detect c, d, and e waves in APG signals; therefore, this investigation aimed to develop an algorithm to detect c, d, and e waves in APG signals. To test the robustness of the developed algorithm, noisy PPG signals (measured after exercise) were used.The PPG data were collected as a minor part of a joint project between Charles Darwin University (Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia), the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), and the Department of Defence and was initiated by the Department of Defence [20]. The main aim of the project was to assess the effect of varying degrees of airconditioning exposure in hot environments [20]. The project has been granted human research ethic clearance from Charles Darwin University [20]. Only de-identified numerical data, representing PPG signals as vectors, are stored on the database. The database is available upon request at Charles Darwin University: http://www.cdu.edu.au/ehse.There are currently no standard PPG databases with annotated c, d and e waves available to evaluate the developed algorithms. One annotated PPG database is available at Charles Darwin University. The data were collected during rest (before exercise) and after 1h of exercise (walking) on a treadmill in the climate control chamber at Northern Territory Institution of Sport (Darwin, Australia). The speed of treadmill was set to 5km/h with a 1% increment corresponding to the effort required to walk with 8kg of webbing. The exercise was considered to be of moderate intensity, and the background of the entire project can be found in [20].PPGs of 27 healthy volunteers (males) with a mean±SD age of 27±6.9 were measured using a photoplethysmography device (Salus APG, Japan), with the sensor located at the cuticle of the second digit of the left hand, in which all subjects were included. Measurements were taken while the subject was at rest on a chair. PPG data were collected at a sampling rate of 200Hz and the duration of each recording was 20s. For signal conditioning and wave detection, MATLAB 2010b (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was used.The PPG signals collected after 1h of exercise were used for training as they includes different shapes of PPG waveforms and noise. Moreover, they contained fast rhythm PPG signals, with a total of 885 heart beats, which had an impact on the detection accuracy.PPG signals measured during rest (before exercise), with a total of 584 heart beats, were used for testing as they contain different morphologies of the c, d, and e waves. They also include different types of noises, such as power-line interferences (50Hz and its harmonics, see Fig. 3(a)), low amplitude signals (see Fig. 3(b)), as well as low-frequency baseline fluctuations (see Fig. 3(c–e)) and irregular heart beats (see Fig. 3(e)).
