@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
A model described lispro PK during closed loop insulin delivery in T2D.The linear two-compartment model fitted well the data.Time-to-peak of lispro and its metabolic clearance rate (MCR) were estimated.Relationships between PK and metabolic/demographic data were examined.Negative correlation found between lispro MCR and fasting insulin/C-peptide.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Insulin pharmacokinetics is not well understood during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We analyzed data collected in 11 subjects with T2D [6 male, 9 white European and two of Indian ethnicity; age 59.7(12.1) years, BMI 30.1(3.9)kg/m2, fasting C-peptide 1002.2(365.8)pmol/l, fasting plasma glucose 9.6(2.2)mmol/l, diabetes duration 8.0(6.2) years and HbA1c 8.3(0.8)%; mean(SD)] who underwent a 24-h study investigating closed-loop insulin delivery at the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Cambridge, UK. Subcutaneous delivery of insulin lispro was modulated every 15min according to a model predictive control algorithm. Two complementary insulin assays facilitated discrimination between exogenous (lispro) and endogenous plasma insulin concentrations measured every 15–60min. Lispro pharmacokinetics was represented by a linear two-compartment model whilst parameters were estimated using a Bayesian approach applying a closed-form model solution. The time-to-peak of lispro absorption (tmax) was 109.6 (75.5–120.5)min [median (interquartile range)] and the metabolic clearance rate (MCRI) 1.26 (0.87–1.56)×10−2l/kg/min. MCRIwas negatively correlated with fasting C-peptide (rs=−0.84; P=.001) and with fasting plasma insulin concentration (rs=−0.79; P=.004). In conclusion, compartmental modelling adequately represents lispro kinetics during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in T2D. Fasting plasma C-peptide or fasting insulin may be predictive of lispro metabolic clearance rate in T2D but further investigations are warranted.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Closed-loop insulin delivery, also known as ‘the artificial pancreas’ combines a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, a control algorithm, and an insulin pump, and has the potential to transform diabetes care [1,2]. The control algorithm receives, in real-time, sensor glucose concentration and computes the amount of insulin to be delivered by the insulin pump. Clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of closed-loop delivery in adults [3], adolescents [4] and pregnant women [5] with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A recent study evaluated closed-loop system in 12 subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) [6] in preparation for testing in non-critically ill inpatients with insulin treated T2D [7].Computer-based simulations have the capability to accelerate cost-effective development of the artificial pancreas. In an in silico testing environment, alternative study protocols can be tested against competing glucose control algorithms prior to clinical evaluations [8]. A number of in silico environments have been proposed in T1D [9,10] but T2D virtual populations are not documented and would be helpful.A glucoregulatory model normally comprises a sub-model of insulin kinetics describing absorption of subcutaneously administered insulin. A number of insulin kinetics models have been proposed mostly applying compartmental modelling [11–15]. However, none of the models was identified using clinical data collected during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in T2D.In the present work, we used compartmental modelling to describe absorption of insulin lispro in subjects with T2D who underwent investigations of closed-loop insulin delivery over 24h [16]. Model parameters were estimated using Bayesian inference [17] by fitting the statistical model to the plasma insulin concentration. We derived a closed-form solution of the compartmental model and integrated it into the statistical model which markedly accelerated the parameter estimation process. We assessed correlations between lispro pharmacokinetics and subjects’ demographic data to identify factors predictive of lispro absorption and clearance.
