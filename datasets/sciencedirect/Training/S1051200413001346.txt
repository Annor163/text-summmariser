@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper focuses on some critical issues in a recently reported approach [V. Singh, Improved LMI-based criterion for global asymptotic stability of 2-D state-space digital filters described by Roesser model using twoʼs complement overflow arithmetic, Digital Signal Process. 22 (2012) 471–475] for the global asymptotic stability of two-dimensional (2-D) fixed-point state-space digital filters described by the Roesser model employing twoʼs complement overflow arithmetic. In particular, it is highlighted that the situation where Singhʼs approach can be applied to ensure the global asymptotic stability of digital filters in the presence of twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities is not conceivable.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the past few decades, a vast amount of research was devoted to the study of the system theoretic problems of two-dimensional (2-D) discrete dynamical systems. Such a study has predominantly been motivated by a wide variety of applications of 2-D discrete systems in many areas such as digital data filtering, image data processing and transmission, seismographic data processing, gas filtration, water stream heating, thermal processes in chemical reactors, 2-D digital control systems, river pollution modeling, grid based wireless sensor networks, modeling of partial differential equations, etc. [1–6].In the implementation of stable and linear recursive digital filters using finite wordlength fixed-point processors, nonlinear effects are introduced owing to the overflow and quantization [7–9]. These nonlinear effects may result in the instability of the designed filter. Therefore, a major concern is to find the conditions under which the filter would be globally asymptotically stable. Many publications relating to the issue of stability of digital filters have appeared (see, for instance, [7–25] and the references cited therein). The common types of overflow nonlinearities are saturation, zeroing, triangular and twoʼs complement [9,24]. The twoʼs complement arithmetic adder is known to be the cheapest among all overflow arithmetic adders employed in practice. The effect of twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities on the stability of one-dimensional (1-D) digital filters has been investigated in [8,11–17]. The stability properties of 2-D digital filters have been studied in the presence of twoʼs complement overflow [18–22], various combinations of quantization and overflow [23], generalized overflow [24], and quantization [25].This paper is directly inspired by a recent paper [22]. In [22], Singh has reported a criterion for the global asymptotic stability of zero-input 2-D digital filters described by the Roesser model [26] implemented with twoʼs complement arithmetic for the addition operation. Splitting the twoʼs complement nonlinearity sector [−1,1] into two smaller sectors [0,1] and [−1,0] together with making use of a certain ‘assumption’ is a key step in the approach of [22]. The approach in [22] appears to be quite distinct from other approaches [8,11–21,24].The purpose of this paper is to highlight that, for the systems implemented with twoʼs complement overflow adders, the ‘assumption’ made in [22] is a major restriction in disguise and it is hard to conceive any situation where Singhʼs approach [22] can be applied to ensure the global asymptotic stability of digital filters in the presence of twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities. It will be demonstrated that all the examples considered in [22] fail to validate this ‘assumption’ and, consequently, the approach [22] is incapable of detecting the global asymptotic stability. Further, the implication of Singhʼs approach [22] is discussed in the context of 1-D digital filters with twoʼs complement overflow arithmetic.Consider the state-space quarter-plane nonlinear 2-D system described by the Roesser model [26]:(1a)x11(k,l)==f(y(k,l))=,(1b)y(k,l)====Ax(k,l),(1c)fh(yh(k,l))=[f1h(y1h(k,l))f2h(y2h(k,l))⋯fmh(ymh(k,l))]T,(1d)fv(yv(k,l))=[f1v(y1v(k,l))f2v(y2v(k,l))⋯fnv(ynv(k,l))]T,(1e)k⩾0,l⩾0,wherek∈Z+,l∈Z+, andZ+denotes the set of nonnegative integers. The two space coordinates k and l are horizontal coordinate and vertical coordinate, respectively. The state vectorsxh(k,l)∈Rmandxv(k,l)∈Rnconvey information horizontally and vertically, respectively. The matricesA11∈Rm×m,A12∈Rm×n,A21∈Rn×m,A22∈Rn×nare the coefficient matrices, and the superscript T denotes the transpose. The overflow nonlinearitiesfih(yih(k,l)),i=1,2,…,mandfiv(yiv(k,l)),i=1,2,…,nare characterized by(2a)fih(yih(k,l))=yih(k,l),if|yih(k,l)|⩽1|fih(yih(k,l))|⩽1,if|yih(k,l)|>1},i=1,2,…,m,(2b)fiv(yiv(k,l))=yiv(k,l),if|yiv(k,l)|⩽1|fiv(yiv(k,l))|⩽1,if|yiv(k,l)|>1},i=1,2,…,n.We observe that twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities belong to (2). As in [22] (see [8,13–17,21,24] also), we assume that the effects of quantization are negligible. Such an assumption is based on a common approximation (i.e., ‘decoupling approximation’ [8,9]) where the effects of quantization and overflow are treated as mutually independent or decoupled. This ‘decoupling approximation’ can be justified if the signals are represented by a sufficiently large number of bits [8,9]. It is understood that system (1) has a finite set of initial conditions, i.e., there exist two positive integers K and L such that [18–21,23,24](3)xv(k,0)=0,k⩾K;xh(0,l)=0,l⩾L,where 0 denotes the null vector or null matrix of appropriate dimension. In this context, it may be pointed out that the initial conditions used in [22] are wrongly defined asxv(k,l)=0,k⩾K;xh(k,l)=0,l⩾L. Following [22], it can be verified that the initial conditions are required to be chosen as (3) in order to arrive at [22, Theorem 1].Eqs. (1)–(3) represent a class of 2-D discrete dynamical systems implemented in finite wordlength fixed-point processors using twoʼs complement signal representation. Examples of such systems are common in engineering and include 2-D digital filters with twoʼs complement overflow arithmetic, 2-D nonlinear digital control systems, models of various physical phenomena (e.g., compartmental systems, single carriageway traffic flow [25], etc.), various dynamical processes represented by the Darboux equation [3] and so on. An example of the system represented by (1)–(3) can be found in wireless sensor networks [5], where each node typically employs 16-bit fixed-point microprocessors for data processing. Thus, the nonlinearities due to finite wordlength are inherently present in such systems.Note that the nonlinear function while satisfying (2) belongs to the sector [−1,1]. Next, consider the sector given by [0,1], i.e.,(4a)fih(0)=0,0⩽fih(yih(k,l))yih(k,l)⩽yih2(k,l),i=1,2,…,m,(4b)fiv(0)=0,0⩽fiv(yiv(k,l))yiv(k,l)⩽yiv2(k,l),i=1,2,…,n,and the sector given by [−1, 0], i.e.,(5a)fih(0)=0,−yih2(k,l)⩽fih(yih(k,l))yih(k,l)⩽0,i=1,2,…,m,(5b)fiv(0)=0,−yiv2(k,l)⩽fiv(yiv(k,l))yiv(k,l)⩽0,i=1,2,…,n.Recently, Singh [22] has studied the problem of global asymptotic stability of the 2-D system (1)–(3). In analyzing the stability of the equilibriumxe=0of the 2-D system (1)–(3), [22] makes use of the following assumption.Assumption 1(See Singh [22].) All nonlinearities (2) in the system (1) at a time either belong to (4) or to (5), but not to both (4) and (5).It may be mentioned that, in the case of 1-D systems, a temporal variable (time) plays a central role. Ref. [22] deals with a class of nonlinear 2-D discrete systems in which time does not have a role. Indeed, the independent variables of interest are spatial variables. Therefore, in the context of 2-D discrete systems, Assumption 1 may be modified as follows.Assumption 2For any set of initial conditions satisfying (3), all nonlinearities (2) in the system (1) along the linek+l=peither belong to (4) or to (5) (but not to both (4) and (5)) for any nonnegative integer p.Now, the main result of [22] may be stated as follows.Theorem 1(See Singh[22].) UnderAssumption 2, the equilibriumxe=0of the system(1)–(3)is globally asymptotically stable if there exist positive definite symmetric matricesPh∈Rm×m,Pv∈Rn×nand a positive definite diagonal matrix D such that(6)[P−ATD−DA2D−P]>0,whereP=Ph⊕Pv=[Ph00Pv]and ‘>’ signifies that the matrix is positive definite.Remark 1Observe that, in the approach of [22], condition (6) alone cannot ensure the global asymptotic stability of (1)–(3). If the system fails to confirm Assumption 2, the global asymptotic stability of the system cannot be established via the approach in [22]. In view of the characteristics of the twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities, it is not natural to expect that Assumption 2 is valid automatically for all kinds of systems given by (1)–(3). The state trajectories of the 2-D system (1)–(3) depend on the state matrix A for a given set of initial conditions. Thus, the validity of Assumption 2 is also dependent on the system parameters and initial conditions.Define(7)si=∑j=1m+n|aij|,i=1,2,…,(m+n),whereA=[aij]. Due to the overflow bound, the state variables in the system (1) and (2) satisfy(8)|xi(k,l)|⩽1,i=1,2,…,(m+n),where[xh(k,l)xv(k,l)]T=x(k,l)=[xi(k,l)]. Using (1b), (7) and (8), one obtains(9)|yi(k,l)|⩽si,i=1,2,…,(m+n),where[yh(k,l)yv(k,l)]T=y(k,l)=[yi(k,l)]. It is known [24] that the equilibriumxe=0of the system (1)–(3) is globally asymptotically stable if‖A‖∞<1, i.e.,(10)si<1,i=1,2,…,(m+n).Of course, it follows from (2) and (9) that all nonlinearities effectively act only in the linear region if (10) holds true. Consequently, under the condition (10), the system (1)–(3) reduces to an overflow-free linear system.In the following, we will focus on some critical issues associated with Assumption 2 in Theorem 1. LetJbe a subset of{1,2,…,(m+n)}. The complement set with regard to{1,2,…,(m+n)}is denoted byJcsuch thatJ∪Jc={1,2,…,(m+n)}. Now, consider the following cases where (10) is violated and overflow occurs within the system (1)–(3).Case 1Let the elements of the matrixAsatisfy(11a)si⩽1,i∈J,(11b)si>1,i∈Jc.From (11a), (9) and (2), it follows that(12)fi(yi(k,l))=yi(k,l),i∈J,where[fh(yh(k,l))fv(yv(k,l))]T=f(y(k,l))=[fi(yi(k,l))]. It is clear from (12) that the nonlinearitiesfi(yi(k,l)),i∈Joperate in the linear region overk+l⩾1wherek⩾0,l⩾0. Consequently, the nonlinearitiesfi(yi(k,l)),i∈Jbelong to (4). Now, to validate Assumption 2, the remaining nonlinearitiesfi(yi(k,l)),i∈Jcneed to satisfy (4). In other words, Assumption 2 holds true for this case if and only if all the nonlinearities are confined to the sector [0,1] for allk+l⩾1. On the other hand, the nonlinearities given by (2) cannot be characterized merely using the sector [0,1]. This implies that the present case falls outside the application scope of Theorem 1.Case 2Let the elements of the matrixAsatisfy(13)si>1,i=1,2,…,(m+n).In this case, depending on the initial conditions, all the nonlinearities may enter into the nonlinear region. Clearly, Assumption 2 is invalid in the situations wherefi(yi(k,l)),i∈Joperate in the sector [0,1] whilefi(yi(k,l)),i∈Jcare in the sector [−1, 0]. Moreover, Assumption 2 demands that, along the progression of states of the system (1)–(3) overk+l⩾1, if operating sector of any nonlinearity alters from sector [0,1] to [−1,0] (or, from sector [−1,0] to [0,1]) then operating sectors of all other nonlinearities must alter simultaneously. This demand is hardly fulfilled for any arbitrary set of initial conditions (3).Summarizing the above, if overflow occurs, it is hard to conceive any situation where the approach in [22] can be applied to ensure the global asymptotic stability of the system (1)–(3).According to El-Agizi and Fahmy [18] (see [19] also), the equilibriumxe=0of the system (1)–(3) is globally asymptotically stable if there exists a positive definite diagonal matrixDsuch that(14)D−ATDA>0.Ref. [22] presents several examples (see [22, Examples 1–3]) of 2-D systems which fail to satisfy (14). However, as shown in [22], these examples satisfy (6). Therefore, it is stated in [22] that, under Assumption 2, the systems considered in such examples are globally asymptotically stable. It may be pointed out that [22] does not investigate whether Assumption 2 is valid for [22, Examples 1–3]. In this section, it is demonstrated that Assumption 2 fails for these examples. By trajectory trace, it is shown that the 2-D systems considered in [22, Examples 1–3] are actually not globally asymptotically stable. Further, an example that satisfies El-Agizi and Fahmyʼs criterion [18] while violates Singhʼs criterion [22] is provided.The following system was considered in [22, Example 1]:(15a)x1h(k+1,l)=f1h(y1h(k,l))=f1h(0.5x2h(k,l)+0.01x1v(k,l)),(15b)x2h(k+1,l)=f2h(y2h(k,l))=f2h(−0.5x1h(k,l)+0.8x2h(k,l)),(15c)x1v(k,l+1)=f1v(y1v(k,l))=f1v(0.01x1h(k,l)+0.01x1v(k,l)).It may be noted that the system (15) is an example of Case 1 discussed in Section 3. In this example, in accordance with (8), we have(16a)|xih(k,l)|⩽1,i=1,2,(16b)|x1v(k,l)|⩽1.It follows, from (15a) and (16), that(17)|y1h(k,l)|=|0.5x2h(k,l)+0.01x1v(k,l)|<1,which together with (2) lead to(18)f1h(y1h(k,l))=y1h(k,l).Similarly, using (15c), (16) and (2), we obtain(19)f1v(y1v(k,l))=y1v(k,l).Since the sector [0,1] includes (18) and (19),f2h(y2h(k,l))needs to be confined to the sector [0,1] in order to satisfy Assumption 2. In other words, Assumption 2 holds true if and only if all the nonlinearities are confined to the sector [0,1]. If overflow occurs in the system (15), the value of|y2h(k,l)|=|−0.5x1h(k,l)+0.8x2h(k,l)|exceeds unity and it is not possible to characterizef2h(y2h(k,l))merely using the sector [0,1]. Thus, the present example fails to satisfy Assumption 2 which, in turn, implies the failure of Theorem 1.Using the same reasoning as above, it is easy to conclude that Theorem 1 is not applicable as a global asymptotic stability test for [22, Examples 2 and 3] also.To discuss further, let us examine the behavior of the state trajectories of [22, Example 1]. Assuming(20a)x1h(0,l)=x2h(0,l)=0,l⩾50,(20b)x1h(0,l)=2041,0⩽l<50,(20c)x2h(0,l)=−4041,0⩽l<50,(20d)x1v(k,0)=0,k⩾0,along the trajectories of the system (15), we obtain(21)[x1h(0,0)x2h(0,0)x1v(0,0)]=[2041−40410]→[x1h(1,0)x2h(1,0)x1v(1,0)]=[−204140410]→[x1h(2,0)x2h(2,0)x1v(2,0)]=[2041−40410]=[x1h(0,0)x2h(0,0)x1v(0,0)].From (21), it is clear that the system (15) exhibits limit cycles. Fig. 1depicts the trajectories of the three state variables for system (15) starting from the initial conditions given by (20). The equilibriumxe=0of the 2-D system (15) is said to be globally asymptotically stable if it is stable (in the sense of Lyapunov) and every solution of (15) tends to the origin ask+l→∞, i.e.,(22)limk→∞and/orl→∞x(k,l)=limk+l→∞x(k,l)=0,for system (15) for any set of initial conditions satisfying (3)[18,19,24]. The unstable behavior of (15) is clearly visible in Fig. 1. By computer simulation, the existence of limit cycles has been observed for other examples (i.e., [22, Examples 2 and 3]) also. Consequently, the 2-D systems considered in [22, Examples 1–3] are, in fact, not globally asymptotically stable. From this result, one can undoubtedly infer that Assumption 2 cannot be valid for [22, Examples 1–3].Next, to illustrate the conservatism of Singhʼs criterion [22] relative to El-Agizi and Fahmyʼs criterion [18], consider an example of a 2-D digital filter represented by (1)–(3) with(23)A==,m=2,n=1.Following the steps similar to (16)–(19), it is easy to show that this example fails to satisfy Assumption 2 and, therefore, falls outside the application scope of Theorem 1. On the other hand, using the Matlab LMI toolbox [27,28], one may obtain a number of choices of the unknown matrixDto satisfy (14) for this example. The following is one of them:(24)D=[1.28790001.36330001.2682].Therefore, according to El-Agizi and Fahmyʼs criterion [18], the digital filter described by (1)–(3) and (23) is globally asymptotically stable.Consider a nonlinear 1-D digital filter described by(25a)x(r+1)=f(y(r))=[f1(y1(r))f2(y2(r))…fn(yn(r))]T,(25b)y(r)=[y1(r)y2(r)…yn(r)]T=Ax(r),wherex(r)is an n-vector state andAis ann×ncoefficient matrix. The nonlinearities characterized by(26)fi(yi(r))=yi(r),if|yi(r)|⩽1|fi(yi(r))|⩽1,if|yi(r)|>1},i=1,2,…,n,are under consideration. Observe that twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities belong to (26). Now, we make the following assumption.Assumption 3All nonlinearities (26) in the system (25) at a time either confined to the sector [0,1] or to the sector [−1,0], but not in both.As a special case of Theorem 1, we have the following result.Theorem 2UnderAssumption 3, the zero solution of the system(25),(26)is globally asymptotically stable if there exist a positive definite symmetric matrixP∈Rn×nand a positive definite diagonal matrix D such that(27)[P−ATD−DA2D−P]>0.To illustrate the implication of Theorem 2, consider the following example of a second-order direct form digital filter implemented with twoʼs complement overflow adder:(28a)x1(r+1)=f1(x2(r)),(28b)x2(r+1)=f2(−0.5x1(r)+0.95x2(r)),wheref1(.)andf2(.)are twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearities. The analysis of limit cycles in such class of digital filters has been carried out in [12]. Starting with the initial conditionsx1(0)=0.8163andx2(0)=−0.8163, along the trajectories of (28), we obtain(29)[x1(0)x2(0)]=[0.8163−0.8163]→[x1(1)x2(1)]=[−0.81630.8163]→[x1(2)x2(2)]=[0.8163−0.8163]=[x1(0)x2(0)].Thus, the filter under consideration exhibits a limit cycle with period two, which implies that (28) is not globally asymptotically stable. On the other hand, using the Matlab LMI toolbox [27,28], it turns out that (27) is feasible for the following values of unknown parameters:(30)P=[1.7345−1.2528−1.25283.2581],D=[1.7301002.9180].Now, let us investigate whether Assumption 3 is valid for the present example. In view of (28) and (26), we have(31)|x1(r)|⩽1,|x2(r)|⩽1.From (31), it follows that the nonlinearityf1(.)in (28a) will always operate in the linear region of the twoʼs complement overflow nonlinearity, i.e.,f1(.)is always confined to the sector [0,1]. Therefore, Assumption 3 demands thatf2(.)must always be confined to the sector [0,1]. On the other hand, an examination of the progression of states given by (29) reveals that this demand is not fulfilled in this example. In other words, Assumption 3 is violated in this example, and hence, Theorem 2 cannot be applied to detect the global asymptotic stability.Finally, to illustrate the conservatism of Theorem 2 relative to an earlier criterion due to Mills, Mullis, and Roberts [11], consider a second-order digital filter described by (25) and (26) with(32)A=[a11a12a21a22]=[00.05−0.20.9].Using similar arguments as above, it can be verified that Assumption 3 fails in this example. According to [11], the zero solution of a second-order digital filter described by (25) and (26) is globally asymptotically stable ifAis 1-D stable and(33)|a11−a22|<1−det(A),wheredet(A)stands for the determinant ofA. Note that the state matrixAgiven by (32) is 1-D stable and satisfies (33). Therefore, [11] ensures the global asymptotic stability of the present system.
