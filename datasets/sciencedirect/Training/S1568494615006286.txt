Not all products are marketed at the same time. Using traditional approaches for identifying the sale associations between earlier-marketed products and later-marketed product is difficult.We propose a new algorithm for identifying association rules of specific later-marketed products by precisely calculating the support values of association rules, which consist of earlier-marketed products and later-marketed product.A new measure (TransRate) was designed to prevent generating useless itemsets.We applied three data sets to evaluate the performance of the proposed SLMCM algorithm.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Not all products are marketed at the same time. If item (x) is marketed much earlier than item (z) is, then item (x) is associated with higher support compared with itemset (xz). In this situation, itemset (xz) cannot satisfy the minimum support; the association rule, x⇒z, possesses low confidence. To create better marketing strategies, managers must understand the sale associations between (x) and (z) and use (x) to promote (z) to increase the sales of (z). However, using traditional approaches for identifying the sale associations between earlier-marketed items and later-marketed item is difficult. In this study, we propose a new algorithm for determining the association rules by precisely calculating the support values of association rules. The association rules, which consist of an atomic consequent and its antecedents, consider the first time the consequent and its antecedents occurring in transactions. Furthermore, a new measure, TransRate, was designed to prevent generating useless itemsets. Experimental results from survey data indicated that the proposed approach can facilitate identifying rules of interest and valuable associations among later-marketed products.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Association rule mining leads to the discovery of associations and correlations between items in large transaction data sets. The determined associations and correlations facilitate business decision-making processes. Association rule mining is a valuable data mining approach that can uncover consumer purchasing behaviors from transaction databases [1]. Agrawal et al. [2] first introduced the problem of association rule mining and defined it as finding all the rules from transaction data that satisfy the minimum support and minimum confidence constraints. The two thresholds, minimum support and minimum confidence, are used to evaluate frequent itemsets and association rules, respectively.Not all products can be marketed at the same time, and products marketed at a later period may be associated with relatively low support and confidence [3]. Hence, determining the association rule for later-marketed products whose support or confidence is lower than the minimum support and confidence thresholds is impossible. Therefore, we argue that each item's marketed time should be considered when using association rule mining algorithms. Then the association rules can precisely present the associations within the itemsets. When focusing on later-marketed items, we should precisely calculate the support of the specific later-marketed consequent's antecedents, which were marketed early. This issue is illustrated in the following example.Assume we have three products named x, y, and z (Fig. 1). Each product's marketed time is distinct. From Fig. 1, the following information can be derived:(1)count(xyz)=20 is the count of transactions in which products xyz occur since June,count(xy)=10+10=20 is the count of transactions in which products xy occur since June,count(xy)=10+10+10+10=40 is the count of transactions in which product xy occur since April,count(x)=40 is the count of transactions in which product x occurs since April, andcount(x)=50 is the count of transactions in which product x occurs since March.Product y is not yet sold in the market in March. Consumers bought product x without product y before April. Furthermore, products x and y were bought together after April. According to the preceding explanations, we know that:(1)conf(x⇒y)=40/50=80% since March,conf(x⇒y)=40/40=100% since April,conf(xy⇒z)=20/40=50% since April, andconf(xy⇒z)=20/20=100% since June.The rule [conf(xy⇒z)=20/20=100% since June] seems more precise because product z is not marketed before June. We seek to precisely understand the association between the antecedent (xy) and the later-marketed consequent (z). If we want to uncover the association between the antecedent (xy) and the later-marketed consequent (z), we should consider the first time that both the antecedent and the later-marketed consequent product occur in the transactions. This is the beginning time from which to calculate the supports of products xyz and xy when generating association rule xy⇒z. This study aimed to identify the association rules of interest by precisely calculating the support values of association rules, which consist of an atomic consequent (later-marketed item) and its antecedents (earlier-marketed items), by considering the first time the atomic consequent and its antecedents occur in the transactions. Moreover, by focusing on the rules with the atomic item in the consequent, we can precisely realize the association of the atomic consequent and its antecedents; that is, which antecedents can be used to promote the atomic consequent when designing marketing strategy.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. The theoretical framework is presented in Section 3. The proposed algorithm and an example are illustrated in Section 4. Section 5 presents the demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which was conducted using survey data. Conclusions and future work are presented in Section 6.
