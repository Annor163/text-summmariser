@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The main aim of this paper is to present a consistency model for interval multiplicative preference relation (IMPR). To measure the consistency level for IMPR, a referenced consistent IMPR of a given IMPR is defined, which has the minimum logarithmic distance from the given IMPR. Based on the referenced consistent IMPR, the consistency level of an IMPR can be measured and an IMPR with unacceptable consistency can be adjusted by a proposed algorithm such that the revised IMPR is of acceptable consistency. A consistency model for group decision making (GDM) problems with IMPRs is proposed to obtain the collective IMPR with highest consistency level. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed approaches in decision making.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A group decision making (GDM) can be interpreted as obtaining a common solution from a panel of experts or decision makers over a finite set of alternatives. In the GDM process, the decision makers may provide opinions over a set of alternatives by means of various preference relations [2,4,5,7,10,11,13–18,25,27,32,34,35,41,42,44,49,52]. The multiplicative preference relation, originally introduced by Saaty [28], is the most widely used preference relation taking the form of a reciprocal judgment matrix. For constructing such judgment matrix, the decision maker should give a ratio of the preference intensity of one alternative over another when comparing each pair of alternatives. Due to uncertainty and vague, time pressure or lack of expertise knowledge, decision makers sometimes may have difficulty in expressing the ratios as crisp numbers. Alternatively, decision makers think they can better or fully provide their opinion by means of interval values instead of crisp numbers. In such cases, IMPR is one useful tool to express decision makers’ preferences.Many researchers paid their attention to decision making problems with IMPRs. For example, Liu et al. [22] introduced an incomplete IMPR and gave the definitions of consistent and acceptable incomplete ones. In addition, they proposed a goal programming model to complement the acceptable incomplete one. Xu and Liu [43] presented a consensus model for group decision making with IMPRs by using the relative projections of individual preference relations on the collective one. Xu and Cai [46] gave a combined weighting method to derive the weights of decision makers and established linear programming models to derive the weight intervals of alternatives. Wang et al. [38] proposed the compatibility of IMPRs in GDM and applied it to determine the weights of experts. Wang and Elhag [36] proposed a goal programming method to obtain interval weights from an interval comparison matrix, which are assumed to be normalized and can be derived from a goal programming model at a time. Zhang et al. [51] proposed a method to derive the interval priority weights for interval pairwise comparison matrix by extracting consistent matrices with linear or nonlinear programming models. Liu et al. [24] gave a transformation formula between interval fuzzy and multiplicative preference relations and presented an algorithm for obtaining the priority weights from consistent or inconsistent interval fuzzy preference relations. Lan et al. [21] proposed a method to derive interval weights by transforming a multiplicative consistent interval fuzzy preference relation into an additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relation. Xu and Chen [50] established some simple and practical linear programming models for deriving the priority weights from various interval fuzzy preference relations. Genc et al. [9] introduced the concept of interval multiplicative transitivity of an interval fuzzy preference relation and put forward a simple formula to derive the priority vector for consistent interval fuzzy preference relation based on the interval multiplicative transitivity.In the preference relations based decision making problems, the measure of consistency level is of high importance. The lack of acceptable consistency can lead to a misleading solution. Most of the literature about IMPR focuses on how to obtain the weights or interval weights (priority vector) for ranking alternatives. Compared with other preference relations, the theories on how to measure and improve the consistency level of IMPR is relatively scarce. For example, Liu [23] defined the acceptably consistent interval reciprocal comparison matrix and proposed a convex combination method to obtain interval weights from an acceptably consistent interval reciprocal comparison matrix. Wang et al. [37] proposed a two-stage logarithmic goal programming method to generate weights from interval comparison matrices, which can be either consistent or inconsistent. By contrast, the consistency condition in Liu [23] is a little too stronger, where an IMPR is said to be of consistency or acceptable consistency only if both of its two corresponding multiplicative preference relations are of consistency or acceptable consistency and there is no complementary effect on consistency between these two corresponding multiplicative preference relations. On the contrary, the consistency condition in the model of Wang et al. [37] is a little too weaker. An IMPR with larger width elements is more inclined to consistent than an IMPR with smaller width elements and it is inconvenient to define a consistent level for an IMPR in the model of Wang et al. [37].To facilitate experts the expression of consistent preferences in the decision processes, Herrera-Viedma et al. [12] presented a characterization of the consistency property defined by the additive or multiplicative transitivity property of the fuzzy preference relations, by which a method is designed to construct consistent multiplicative preference relations from a set of n−1 preference values. In this paper, applying this method, we define and derive a referenced consistent IMPR for a given IMPR, by which the consistency level of the IMPR can be measured and a straightforward approach to improve the consistency of the IMPR can also be easily derived. To do this, the rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief introduction to the basic notions is provided. Section 3 proposed a new method to measure the consistency level of IMPR. In Section 4, a consistency model for GDM problems with IMPR is proposed. Section 5 makes a comparison between different consistency models of IMPR. Section 6 gives the conclusions.Let X=(x1, x2,…, xn) be a finite set of alternatives and I={1, 2, …, n} be the set of index. Saaty [28] proposed the multiplicative preference relation to describe an expert's preference, which was defined as following:Definition 1[28]. A multiplicative preference relation R on a set of alternatives X is represented by a reciprocal matrixR=(rij)n×nwith(1)rij>0,rijrji=1,rii=1,∀i,j∈Iwhere rijexpresses the ratio of the preference intensity of alternative xito that of xj. Especially, rij<1 indicates that xjis preferred to xi; rij=1 indicates indifference between xiand xj; rij>1 indicates that xiis preferred to xj.Since Saaty's 1–9 scale [28] is the most widely used tool to deal with such a situation, unless stated otherwise, in what follows, we apply the 1–9 ratio scale to express the preference values. That is, rij=1/9 indicates that xjis absolutely preferred to xiand rij=9 indicates that xiis absolutely preferred to xj.Definition 2[31]. A multiplicative preference relationR=(rij)n×nis consistent, if the following transitivity is satisfied[31]. An IMPRR˜on a set of alternatives X is represented by a reciprocal matrixIn addition, Liu [23] gave the following definition of consistency for an IMPR, which this paper applies to define a consistent IMPR.Definition 4[23]. LetR˜=(r˜ij)n×nbe an IMPR.R˜is said to be consistent if the multiplicative preference relationsR−=(Rij−)n×nandR+=(Rij+)n×nare both consistent, whereIf the multiplicative preference relationsR−=(Rij−)n×nandR+=(Rij+)n×nare all of acceptable consistency, thenR˜=(r˜ij)n×nis acceptably consistent. Otherwise,R˜=(r˜ij)n×nis said to be unacceptably consistent [23].In the model of Liu [23], the consistency level of an IMPRR˜is determined by those of the corresponding multiplicative preference relations R− and R+, and there is no complementary effect between them. For example,R˜is said to be acceptably consistent on the condition that R− and R+ are all of acceptable consistency. Different with Liu [23], in what follows, we apply the logarithmic least squares method [20,30,32] to construct a referenced consistent IMPRR˜*, by which the consistency level of an IMPRR˜is measured and the complementary effect between corresponding multiplicative preference relations R− and R+ is permitted.Definition 5LetA˜=(a˜ij)n×n=([aij−,aij+])n×nandB˜=(b˜ij)n×n=([bij−,bij+])n×nbe two IMPRs with 1–9 scale. The logarithmic distance betweenA˜andB˜is defined as follows:We can easily derive the following properties of the logarithmic distance between IMPRs.Theorem 1The logarithmic distanced(A˜,B˜)has the following properties.d(A˜,B˜)=d(B˜,A˜);1≥d(A˜,B˜)≥0, whered(A˜,B˜)=0if and only ifA˜=B˜, i.e.,aij−=bij−andaij+=bij+, ∀i, j∈I, andd(A˜,B˜)=1if and only ifaij−=aij+=9andbij−=bij+=1/9or vise versa;d(A˜,B˜)=14n(n−1)ln29∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1n[(lnAij−−lnBij−)2+(lnAij+−lnBij+)2],Aij−,Aij+,Bij−, andBij+are defined by Eq. (3).The proof of Theorem 1 is straightforward and omitted.LetR˜andR˜′be an IMPR and a consistent IMPR, respectively.d(R˜,R˜′)expresses the logarithmic distance betweenR˜andR˜′. Without doubt, the value ofd(R˜,R˜′)may vary with the change ofR˜′. Then, for a given IMPRR˜, by a suitable method, we can derive a consistent IMPRR˜*which has the minimum logarithmic distance fromR˜. And the consistency level ofR˜can be defined based on the logarithmic distance betweenR˜andR˜*. Obviously, the smaller the value ofd(R˜,R˜*), the more consistent IMPRR˜. Ifmind(R˜,R˜′)=d(R˜,R˜*)=0, thenR˜=R˜*, i.e., the IMPRR˜is also consistent.Definition 6LetR˜=(r˜ij)n×nbe IMPR andR˜′=(r˜′ij)n×nbe any consistent IMPR. Then, the consistency level ofR˜is defined as follows:(5)CL(R˜)=1−mind(R˜,R˜′)And an IMPRR˜=(r˜ij)n×nis said to be consistent if and only ifCL(R˜)=1, i.e.,mind(R˜,R˜′)=0. Given a consistency threshold value α∈[0, 1], ifCL(R˜)≥αis satisfied, thenR˜=(r˜ij)n×nis called an IMPR with acceptable consistency.For the sake of argument, we denoteR˜′with minimumd(R˜,R˜′)asR˜*and call it the referenced consistent IMPR. To further determineR˜*, we give the following Theorem 2.Theorem 2LetR˜=(r˜ij)n×nbe IMPR. The referenced consistent IMPRR˜*=(r˜ij*)n×n=([rij*−,rij*+])n×nis derived as followsAccording to Definition 6, we have the following objective function:Obviously, to obtain the solution of (8), we only need to solve the following function:(9)min∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1n(lnRij−−lnR′ij−)2+(lnRij+−lnR′ij+)2Some authors [1,6,12,45] showed if there exists at least a set of n−1 non-leading diagonal known elements in an incomplete multiplicative preference relation, then each unknown element in it can be obtained by its adjoining known elements. Based on this, we can construct the referenced consistent IMPRR˜*ifRi(i+1)*−andRi(i+1)*+(i=1,2,…,n−1)are firstly determined, by which other elements inR˜*can be subsequently obtained by the method of Herrera-Viedma et al. [12]:Rij*−=Ri(i+1)*−R(i+1)(i+2)*−,…,R(j−1)j*−,j>i+1Rij*+=Ri(i+1)*+R(i+1)(i+2)*+,…,R(j−1)j*+,j>i+1.(9) can be rewritten as follows:min∑i=1n−1[(lnRi(i+1)−−lnR′i(i+1)−)2+(lnRi(i+1)+−lnR′i(i+1)+)2]+∑i=1n−1∑j=i+2n[(lnRij−−lnR′ij−)2+(lnRij+−lnR′ij+)2]To derive the referenced consistent IMPRR˜*, we can construct the following model (M-1):(M-1)min∑i=1n−1[(lnRi(i+1)−−lnR′i(i+1)−)2+(lnRi(i+1)+−lnR′i(i+1)+)2]+∑i=1n−1∑j=i+2n[(lnRij−−lnR′ij−)2+(lnRij+−lnR′ij+)2]s.t.R′ij−=R′i(i+1)−R′(i+1)(i+2)−...R′(j−1)j−,j>i+1R′ij+=R′i(i+1)+R′(i+1)(i+2)+...R′(j−1)j+,j>i+1R′ij−>0,R′ij+>0,∀i,j∈ITo solve this model, we can construct the Lagrange function:(10)L(R′,c)=∑i=1n−1[(lnRi(i+1)−−lnR′i(i+1)−)2+(lnRi(i+1)+−lnR′i(i+1)+)2]+∑i=1n−1∑j=i+2n[(lnRij−−lnR′ij−)2+(lnRij+−lnR′ij+)2]−∑i=1n−1∑j=i+2ncij−lnR′ij−−∑l=ij−1lnR′l(l+1)−−∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1ncij+lnR′ij+−∑l=ij−1lnR′l(l+1)+wherecij−andcij+are the Lagrange multipliers.By differentiating (10) with respect toR′i(i+1)−andR′ij−(i=1, 2,…,n−1, j>i+1), and setting these partial derivatives equal to zero, we derive the following set of equations:∂L(R′,c)∂R′i(i+1)−=−2(lnRi(i+1)−−lnR′i(i+1)−)R′i(i+1)−+∑l=1i−1cl(i+1)−+∑l=1i∑j=i+2nclj−R′i(i+1)−=0,∂L(R′,c)∂R′ij−=−2lnRij−−lnR′ij−R′ij−−cij−R′ij−=0,j>i+1.That is,2(lnRi(i+1)−−lnR′i(i+1)−)=∑l=1i−1cl(i+1)−+∑l=1i∑j=i+2nclj−and−2(lnRij−−lnR′ij−)=cij−.As a result, we havelnRi(i+1)−−lnR′i(i+1)−=∑l=1i−1lnR′l(i+1)−−lnRl(i+1)−+∑l=1i∑j=i+2nlnR′lj−−lnRlj−,i.e.,∑l=1i∑m=i+1nlnR′lm−=∑l=1i∑m=i+1nlnRlm−.Letsi=∑l=1i∑m=i+1nlnR′lm−=∑l=1i∑m=i+1nlnRlm−, then we haves1+(s1−s2)=∑m=2nlnR′1m−+∑m=2nlnR′1m−−∑l=12∑m=3nlnR′lm−=∑m=2nlnR′1m−+lnR′12−−∑m=3nlnR′2m−=∑m=2nlnR′1m−+lnR′12−+∑m=3nlnR′m2−=∑m=1nlnR′1m−+∑m=1nlnR′m2−=∑m=1nlnR′1m−+lnR′m2−Similarly, we haves1+(s1−s2)=∑m=1n(lnR1m−+lnRm2−).SinceR′−=(R′ij−)n×nis consistent, we haves1+(s1−s2)=∑m=1nlnR′1m−+lnR′m2−=∑m=1nlnR′1m−R′m2−=nlnR′12−.Consequently, we obtainlnR′12−=1n∑m=1nlnR1m−+lnRm2−,i.e.,(11)R′12−=∏m=1nR1m−Rm2−1/n.Similarly, we can also obtain(12)R′12+=∏m=1nR1m+Rm2+1/n.For 2≤i≤n−2, we have(si−si+1)−(si−1−si)=∑l=1i∑m=i+1nlnR′lm−−∑l=1i+1∑m=i+2nlnR′lm−−∑l=1i−1∑m=inlnR′lm−−∑l=1i∑m=i+1nlnR′lm−=∑l=1nlnR′l(i+1)−−∑l=1nlnR′li−=∑l=1nlnR′l(i+1)−+∑l=1nlnR′il−=∑l=1nlnR′il−R′l(i+1)−=nlnR′i(i+1)−.Similarly, we can also obtain(si−si+1)−(si−1−si)=∑l=1nln(Ril−Rl(i+1)−),which meansnlnR′i(i+1)−=∑l=1nlnRil−Rl(i+1)−,i.e.,(13)R′i(i+1)−=∏l=1nRil−Rl(i+1)−1/n,2≤i≤n−2.Similarly, we can also obtain(14)R′i(i+1)+=∏l=1nRil+Rl(i+1)+1/n,2≤i≤n−2.In addition, for i=n−1, we havesn−1−(sn−2−sn−1)=∑l=1n−1lnR′ln−−∑l=1n−2∑m=n−1nlnR′lm−−∑l=1n−1lnR′ln−=∑l=1n−1lnR′ln−−∑l=1n−2lnR′l(n−1)−−lnR′(n−1)n−=∑l=1n−1lnR′ln−−∑l=1n−2lnR′l(n−1)−+lnR′n(n−1)−=∑l=1nlnR′ln−−∑l=1nlnR′l(n−1)−=∑l=1nlnR′(n−1)l−R′ln−=nlnR′(n−1)n−,which meansnlnR′(n−1)n−=∑l=1nlnR(n−1)l−Rln−,i.e.,(15)R′(n−1)n−=∏l=1nR(n−1)l−Rln−1/n.Similarly, we can also obtain(16)R′(n−1)n+=∏l=1nR(n−1)l+Rln+1/n.Taking (11)–(16) together, we obtain(17)R′i(i+1)−=∏l=1nRil−Rl(i+1)−1/n,i=1,2,…,n−1(18)R′i(i+1)+=∏l=1nRil+Rl(i+1)+1/n,i=1,2,…,n−1SinceR′−=(R′ij−)n×nis consistent, we have(19)R′ij−=R′i(i+1)−R′(i+1)(i+2)−,…,R′(j−1)j−,j>i+1(20)R′ij+=R′i(i+1)+R′(i+1)(i+2)+,…,R′(j−1)j+,j>i+1Then, by (17)–(20), we can also obtainR′ij−=∏l=1nRil−Rlj−1/n,j>i+1R′ij+=∏l=1nRil+Rlj+1/n,j>i+1.To sum up, for any j>i, we have(21)Rij*−=R′ij−=∏l=1nRil−Rlj−1/n(22)Rij*+=R′ij+=∏l=1nRil+Rlj+1/nwhich is the optimal solution of model (M-1).SinceR˜′=(r˜′ij)n×nis consistent, thenR′−=(R′ij−)n×nandR′+=(R′ij+)n×nare both consistent, whereR′ij−=r′ij+,i<j1,i=jr′ij−,i>jandR′ij+=r′ij−,i<j1,i=jr′ij+,i>j.Consequently, (21) and (22) can be rewritten as (6) and (7), respectively.This completes the proof of Theorem 2.□Theorem 2 indicates that we can construct a consistent IMPR from a set of n−1 interval preference values based on the multiplicative consistency, similar with the method proposed by Herrera-Viedma et al. [12] to facilitate experts the expression of consistent preferences in the decision processes. In addition, for incomplete IMPRs, we can apply the iterative procedure proposed by Alonso et al. [1] to estimate missing values, where three estimates of the preference degree of alternative are provided to create the left and right IMPRs.If the IMPRR˜is not of acceptable consistency, the preference values inR˜are often expected to be adjusted in order to improve the consistency. Motivated by Xu and Wei [48], and Dong et al. [8], we introduce an algorithm to improve the consistency ofR˜.Algorithm 1LetR˜=(r˜ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×nbe an IMPR, α be the consistency threshold value and k be the number of iterative times.Step 1: LetR˜(0)=(r˜ij(0))n×n=([rij(0)−,rij(0)+])n×n=R˜, and k=0.Step 2: Derive the referenced consistent IMPRR˜(k)*ofR˜(k)and calculate the consistency level ofR˜(k), i.e.,CL(R˜(k))=1−d(R˜(k),R˜(k)*).Step 2: IfCL(R˜(k))≥α, then go to Step 5; otherwise, continue with the next step.Step 3: ReturnR˜(k)to the decision maker to reconsider giving an adjusted IMPRR˜(k+1), where the adjusted values should satisfy,rij(k+1)−∈(min(rij(k)−,rij(k)*−),max(rij(k)−,rij(k)*−))andrij(k+1)+∈(min(rij(k)+,rij(k)*+),max(rij(k)+,rij(k)*+)).Step 4: Let k=k+1 and return to step 2.Step 5: Output k,R˜(k)andCL(R˜(k)).R˜(k)is the adjusted IMPR with acceptable consistency.In what follows, we prove that the above Algorithm is convergent.Theorem 3LetR˜=(r˜ij)n×nbe an IMPR and α be the consistency threshold value. Let{R˜(k)}be the matrix sequence generated in Algorithm 1. Then, for any k, we haveCL(R˜(k+1))>CL(R˜(k)), andlimk→∞(CL(R˜(k)))≥α.Sincerij(k+1)−∈(min(rij(k)−,rij(k)*−),max(rij(k)−,rij(k)*−))andrij(k+1)+∈(min(rij(k)+,rij(k)*+),max(rij(k)+,rij(k)*+)), we have, for any i and j,(lnrij(k+1)−−lnrij(k)*−)2+(lnrij(k+1)+−lnrij(k)*+)2<(lnrij(k)−−lnrij(k)*−)2+(lnrij(k)+−lnrij(k)*+)2.By Eq. (4), we haved(R˜(k),R˜(k)*)>d(R˜(k+1),R˜(k)*)≥d(R˜(k+1),R˜(k+1)*), i.e.,CL(R˜(k+1))>CL(R˜(k)).And sinceCL(R˜(k))≤1, the sequence{CL(R˜(k))}is monotone increasing and has upper limit.Thus, we havelimk→∞(CL(R˜(k)))=sup{CL(R˜(k))}.Suppose thatlimk→∞(CL(R˜(k)))<α. Then, according to Algorithm 1, the consistency level of the adjusted IMPR satisfiesCL(R˜(k+1))>CL(R˜(k))for k→∞, which meansCL(R˜(k+1))>sup{CL(R˜(k))}for k→∞. Such result is contradicted withlimk→∞(CL(R˜(k)))=sup{CL(R˜(k))}.As a result, we havelimk→∞(CL(R˜(k)))≥α.This completes the proof of Theorem 3. □Example 1Assume that we have four alternatives to compare and obtain the following IMPRR˜.By Theorem 2, we can derive the referenced consistent IMPRR˜*ofR˜as follows.R˜*=[1,1][1.8612,2.1779][3.8337,4.6058][1.6818,8.9721][0.4591,0.5373][1,1][2.0598,2.1147][0.9036,4.1195][0.2171,0.2608][0.4729,0.4855][1,1][0.4387,1.9480][0.1115,0.5946][0.2427,1.1067][0.5133,2.2795][1,1].Then, based on Definition 6, we haved(R˜,R˜*)=0.1772andCL(R˜)=0.8228.Suppose the consistency threshold value α=0.85, then the consistency level ofR˜is unacceptable. SoR˜is returned to the decision maker to reconsider giving an adjusted IMPRR˜(1).R˜(1)=[1,1][1,3][3,5][3,7][1/3,1][1,1][2,3][1/3,3][1/5,1/3][1/3,1/2][1,1][1/2,2][1/7,1/3][1/3,3][1/2,2][1,1].Then, we obtain the following referenced consistent IMPRR˜*(1).R˜(1)*=[1,1][1.9168,2.4323][3.2237,5.2974][1.4565,8.1491][0.4111,0.5217][1,1][1.6818,2.1779][0.7598,3.3504][0.1888,0.3102][0.4591,0.5946][1,1][0.4518,1.5383][0.1227,0.6866][0.2985,1.3161][0.6501,2.2134][1,1].Then, based on Definition 6, we haved(R˜(1),R˜(1)*)=0.1288andCL(R˜)=0.8712>α, which means the adjusted IMPRR˜(1)is acceptably consistent.In what follows, we consider a group decision making problem with IMPR. Let d=(d1, d2, …, dt) be the set of decision makers, whose weight vector is ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωt), with ωk∈[0, 1] and∑k=1tωk=1. Suppose each decision makers dkprovides his/her preference values by IMPRR˜k=(r˜ijk)n×n. Thus, the collective IMPRR˜=(r˜ij)n×ncan be obtained by the following weighted geometric average operator:(23)r˜ij=∏k=1trijk−ωk,∏k=1trijk+ωk.Liu [23] proved that the collective IMPRR˜=(r˜ij)n×nis consistent ifR˜k=(r˜ijk)n×n(k=1, 2,…,t) are all consistent IMPRs. In this section, we introduce some other properties on the consistency ofR˜=(r˜ij)n×n.Theorem 4The referenced consistent collective IMPRR˜*is the weighted geometric average of the corresponding referenced consistent individual IMPRsR˜k*(k=1, 2,…,t), that is,According to Eqs. (3) and (23), we derive the collective IMPRR˜=(r˜ij)n×nThen, for any i<j, based on Eqs.

Apart from the consistency levels of individual IMPRs, the weights of decision makers also have impact onCL(R˜).Suppose that weights of decision makers are incompletely known. H denotes the set of known weight information, which is normally constructed by the following linear constraints [19,26,47]: (1) A weak ranking: ωi≥ωj, i≠j, (2) A strict ranking: ωi−ωj≥σij, 1≥σij>0, (3) A ranking with multiples:ωi≥σijwj,0≤σij≤1, i≠j, (4) An interval form: σi≤ωi≤σi+θi, 0≤σi≤σi+θi≤1, (5) A ranking of differences: ωi−ωj≥ωk−ωl, i≠j≠k≠l. Then, we construct the following optimization model (M-2) to determine the weight vector of decision makers, in order to obtain the collective IMPRR˜with highestCL(R˜).(M-2)min∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1n∑k=1tωklnRijk−−1n∑l=1nlnRilk−+lnRljk−2+∑k=1tωklnRijk+−1n∑l=1nlnRilk++lnRljk+2s.t.∑k=1tωk=10≤ωk≤1ω∈HBased on above analysis, an algorithm to generate a solution for GDM problem with IMPRs is described below:Algorithm 2Step 1: Each decision makers dkprovides his/her preference values by IMPRR˜k=(r˜ijk)n×n.Step 2: Utilize Theorem 2 and Eq. (5) to calculate the consistency level of each individual IMPRR˜k.Step 3: For eachR˜k, ifCL(R˜k)<α, then apply Algorithm 1 to derive the corresponding adjusted IMPRR˜kAwith acceptable consistency.Step 4: If the weights of the decision makers are known, utilize Eq. (23) to aggregate the individual IMPR, and then get the collective IMPRR˜; on the contrary, if the weights of the decision makers are incompletely known, then build and solve the MOD 3 to derive the weight vector of decision makers, and obtain the collective IMPRR˜by Eq. (23).Step 5: Utilize the following geometric average operator(28)r˜i=∏j=1nrij−1/n,∏j=1nrij+1/nto get an interval weight vector ofR˜.Step 6: Apply the possibility degree formula given in Liu [23] to derive a possibility degree matrix and obtain the ranking order for all the alternatives.Assume the consistency threshold value α=0.85 and there are three decision makers, who are responsible for the evaluation of the alternatives Ai(i=1, 2, 3,4).Step 1: They compare four alternatives with respect to certain criterion and derive the following IMPRsR˜k(k=1, 2, 3).R˜1=[1,1][1,3][3,5][4,6][1/3,1][1,1][3,4][1/3,3][1/5,1/3][1/4,1/3][1,1][1/2,4][1/6,1/4][1/3,3][1/4,2][1,1]R˜2=[1,1][2,4][4,6][4,8][1/4,1/2][1,1][4,7][1/5,1][1/6,1/4][1/7,1/4][1,1][1,3][1/8,1/4][1,5][1/3,1][1,1]R˜3=[1,1][1,2][2,5][3,8][1/2,1][1,1][2,3][3,5][1/5,1/2][1/3,1/2][1,1][1,2][1/8,1/3][1/5,1/3][1/2,1][1,1]Step 2: By Theorem 2 and Definition 6, we haveCL(R˜1)=0.8712,CL(R˜2)=0.7562andCL(R˜3)=0.9673. That is,R˜1andR˜3are acceptably consistent, whileR˜2is not acceptably consistent.Step 3: By applying Algorithm 1, we derive the following adjusted IMPRR˜2(1)and its corresponding referenced consistent IMPRR˜2(1)*:R˜2(1)=[1,1][2,3][5,7][2,8][1/3,1/2][1,1][1,2][1,3][1/7,1/5][1/2,1][1,1][1/2,1][1/8,1/2][1/3,1][1,2][1,1]R˜2(1)*=[1,1][2.5149,3.0274][3.7606,6.9640][2.1147,7.9686][0.3303,0.3976][1,1][1.4953,2.3003][0.8409,2.6321][0.1436,0.2659][0.4347,0.6688][1,1][0.5623,1.1442][0.1255,0.4729][0.3799,1.18920][0.8740,1.8786][1,1],from which we haved(R˜2(1),R˜2(1)*)=0.0584andCL(R˜2(1))=0.9416.Consequently,R˜1,R˜2(1)andR˜3are all acceptably consistent.Step 4: Suppose the weights of the decision makers are incompletely known as follows:H={0.1≤ω1≤0.3,0.2≤ω2≤0.4,0.4≤ω3≤0.6,2ω2≤ω3}.Based onR˜1,R˜2(1)andR˜3, we build the following optimization model:min0.3629ω12+0.0749ω22+0.0233ω32s.t.∑k=13ωk=10≤ωk≤1ω∈HSolving the above optimization model, we have ω1=0.1, ω2=0.3, and ω3=0.6.By Eq. (23), we obtain the collective IMPRR˜:R˜=[1,1][1.2311,2.3522][2.7417,5.5311][2.7339,7.7731][0.4251,0.8123][1,1][1.6917,2.7339][1.7321,4.0760][0.1808,0.3647][0.3658,0.5911][1,1][0.7579,1.7411][0.1286,0.3658][0.2453,0.5773][0.5743,1.3194][1,1].Step 5: By Eq. (28), we get the interval weight vector ofR˜as follows:r˜1=[1.7429,3.1712],r˜2=[1.0564,1.7345],r˜3=[0.4732,0.7827],r˜4=[0.3669,0.7265].Step 6: We can easily obtain the ranking order: A1≻A2≻A3≻A4.Apart from the consistency models proposed by Liu [23] and this paper, Wang et al. [37] gave the following definition of consistency:Given an IMPRR˜=(r˜ij)n×n=([rij−,rij+])n×n, if the following feasible region is nonempty:(29)Sw=w=(w1,w2,…,wn)rij−≤(wi/wj)≤rij+,∑i=1nwi=1,wi>0thenR˜is said to be a consistent IMPR; otherwise,R˜is said to be inconsistent.According to Liu [23],R˜is said to be consistent if the multiplicative preference relationsR−=(Rij−)n×nandR+=(Rij+)n×nare both consistent. In fact, the condition thatR˜should satisfy as a consistent IMPR in Liu [23] is much stricter than that of Wang et al. [37]. In what follows, we propose Theorem 6 to present the relationship between the above two consistency definitions.Theorem 6If multiplicative preference relationR−=(Rij−)n×norR+=(Rij+)n×nis consistent, then the feasible region Swis nonempty.Letλmax−and(λ1−,λ2−,…,λn−)be the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector ofR−=(Rij−)n×n, respectively.According to Satty [28], ifR−=(Rij−)n×nis consistent, then we haveλmax−=nandRij−=λi−/λj−. By normalizing the eigenvector, we have the weight vectorw−=(w1−,w2−,…,wn−), wherewi−=λi−/(∑j=1nλj−)and∑j=1nwj−=1.Thus, by Eq. (3), we haveRij−=rij+=wi−/wj−≥rij−for i<j andRij−=rij−=wi−/wj−≤rij+for i>j, which means the weight vectorw−=(w1−,w2−,…,wn−)satisfies the requirements in Eq. (29).Similarly, we can also prove that the feasible region Swis nonempty ifR+=(Rij+)n×nis consistent.This completes the proof of Theorem 6.□Moreover, the consistency definition of Liu [23] is closely related to the typical consistency test technique proposed by Saaty [28,29], by which the consistency of IMPR can be checked. In the definition of Liu [23],R˜is said to be acceptably consistent only if R− and R+ are both of acceptable consistency. For example, let the threshold value of consistency ratio (CR) be 0.1. If CR(R−)=0 and CR(R+)=0.11, thenR˜is unacceptable consistency. Although R− is consistent,R˜is unacceptably consistent only because the value of CR(R+) is a little higher than 0.1. There is no complementary effect between R− and R+, this may be not agree with the real situation. In this paper, we construct a referenced consistent IMPRR˜*, by which the consistency level of an IMPRR˜is measured and the complementary effect between corresponding multiplicative preference relations R− and R+ is permitted.This paper mainly focuses on the consistency model for IMPR. Similar models on other forms of non-crisp preference relations are also proposed. For example, Alonso et al. [3] proposed a complete procedure to estimate missing values in incomplete two-tuple fuzzy linguistic preference relations based on the additive consistency property. Wu and Chiclana [39] investigated the multiplicative consistency property of interval fuzzy reciprocal preference relation and defined the consistency indexes for three different levels. Wu and Chiclana [40] developed a consistency based procedure to estimate missing values in intuitionistic reciprocal preference relations using an indirect chain of alternatives and quantified the consistency index of preferences provided by experts. These preference relations abovementioned are widely used representation formats to express decision makers’ uncertain preference information and decision makers can select the desired formats according to their own habits and preferences. The consistency model proposed by this paper is constructed based on Saaty's multiplicative consistency [31] while the consistency models introduced by Wu and Chiclana [39,40] are constructed based on the multiplicative transitivity property proposed by Tanino [33], which is regarded as the most appropriate property for modeling cardinal consistency of reciprocal preference relations [5]. If the Saaty's 1–9 scale [28] is taken in our consistency model for IMPR, we may obtain an IMPR with entries not in the interval [1/9, 9]. In such cases, the transformation function proposed by Herrera-Viedma et al. [12] is proposed to construct another IMPR which preserves reciprocity and consistency.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Since consistency measure plays an important role in preference relation based decision making, this paper introduce a consistency model for IMPR. By logarithmic least squares method, a referenced consistent IMPR of a given IMPR is constructed, which has the minimum logarithmic distance from the given IMPR. By the referenced consistent IMPR constructed, the consistency level of the given IMPR can not only be easily measured but also be adjusted straightforward if its consistency is unacceptable. In addition, the definition of an acceptably consistent IMPR given in this paper has obvious difference with other similar definitions. That is, the corresponding two multiplicative preference relations of an IMPR are not independent and the complementary effect between them is permitted. Furthermore, a consistency model for GDM problems with IMPR is proposed to obtain the collective IMPR with highest consistency level. As last, it is worth mentioning that if an IMPR reduced to a multiplicative preference relation, i.e., all the intervals in the reciprocal judgment matrix become exact numbers, the theories and methods proposed are also suitable for use.
