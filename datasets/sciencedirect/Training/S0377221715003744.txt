@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Used products collected for value recovery are characterized by higher uncertainty regarding their quality condition compared to raw materials used in forward supply chains. Because of the need for timely information regarding their quality, a common business practice is to establish procedures for the classification of used products (returns), which is not always error-free. The existence of a multitude of sites where used products can be collected, further increases the complexity of reverse supply chain design and management. In this paper we formulate the objective function for a reverse supply chain with multiple collection sites and the possibility of returns sorting, assuming general distributions of demand and returns quality in a single-period context. We derive conditions for the determination of the optimal acquisition and remanufacturing lot-sizing decisions under alternative locations of the unreliable classification/sorting operation. We provide closed-form expressions for the selection of the optimal sorting location in the special case of identical collection sites and guidelines for tackling the decision-making problem in the general case. Furthermore, we examine analytically the effect of the cost and accuracy of the classification procedure on the profitability of the alternative supply chain configurations. Our analysis, which is accompanied by a brief numerical investigation, offers insights regarding the impact of yield variability, number of collection sites, and location and characteristics of the returns classification operation both on the acquisition decisions and on the profitability of the reverse supply chain.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Despite existing similarities, the differences between conventional (forward) and reverse supply chains (RSC) are numerous and generate a number of new research needs in the area of supply chain management. For example, contrary to typical forward supply chains where the number of suppliers for a specific raw material or component is usually small, collection of returns in RSC usually requires an extensive network of collection points. Product complexity is also higher in RSC, since returns consist of final products instead of simpler subassemblies or raw materials. Product quality is another complicating factor in RSC management because quality uncertainty is much higher in used products than in new ones.Timely quality assessment is important in RSC because it can prevent waste of resources on practically useless items. In the RSC literature, there is a plethora of contributions on the assessment of the value of information on returns quality considering a diversity of industrial applications, such as Bosch (Guide, Souza, Van Wassenhove, & Blackburn, 2006), CertiCell (Galbreth & Blackburn, 2010a), automotive industry “similar to GreenLeaf LLC” (Bakal & Akcali, 2006), Hewlett-Packard (HP; Guide, Muyldermans, & Van Wassenhove, 2005) and Pitney-Bows (Ferguson, Guide, Koca, & Souza, 2009). As a result of the well-established value of quality information, the development of fast procedures for the classification of returned products according to their remaining value is a common business practice. However, since sometimes it is important to adopt sorting procedures characterized by low operational cost, firms often have to compromise classification accuracy.Considering a large number of collection locations and modeling independently the quality characteristics of products at different locations is dictated for a number of reasons. First of all, for achieving adequate returns flow an extensive collection network is necessary. As most remanufacturing firms acknowledge, each of their supply sources have stable distributions of returns quality (see for example Jayaraman, 2006). However, depending on the extent of the collection network, supply sources may differ in used products quality, because of differences in end-users characteristics as for example income, social status, motivation for returning used products, differences in the certain characteristics of the location of usage (e.g. temperature, humidity, fuel quality, electricity network stability, etc.), and differences in product life-cycle duration. Moreover, different collection locations may be considered as representations of different product models or products that were initially manufactured by different original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which are remanufactured in a single facility to satisfy demand in a unified market. Of course, there exist RSC with similar used products characteristics at all, some or none of the available collection sites (CS).Although the issues of multiple suppliers, random yield and the value of quality information through classification/sorting are not new in the supply chain literature, they have not been examined yet in an integrated manner. Our aim and contribution is to provide an integrated treatment of all these distinctive features of RSC in a general setting and to study their impact on operational decisions and on the profitability of RSC. More specifically, we study acquisition and remanufacturing decisions in RSC consisting of multiple collection sites with uncertain quality of returned used products. This uncertainty can be resolved to a certain extent by a sorting procedure, which in turn is subject to classification errors. We also consider the optimal choice of sorting location/timing among alternative possibilities including the no sorting option.In addition to providing a comprehensive analysis of all these issues simultaneously for the first time, the contribution of the present paper includes a detailed analysis of the impact of the operational characteristics and accuracy of the sorting procedure on the determination of the optimal supply chain configuration and acquisition quantities, in conjunction with returns quality. Currently, there is a diversity of technological solutions and approaches for establishing returns classifications procedures; complete disassembly, specialized testing, usage-data recording, monitoring with RFID-tags and visual inspection are among the alternative classification methods employed in practice for used products quality evaluation. A more detail discussion on related issues can also be found in Van Wassenhove and Zikopoulos (2011). According to Fleischmann, Galbreth, and Tagaras (2010), there is a need for studies which compare different grading options in terms of timing, location and method used. Moreover, Fleischmann et al. (2010) point out that the lack of studies with such features in the RSC literature is remarkable, given that returns grading is among the key processes that distinguish closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) from conventional supply chains. In order to contribute toward this direction, in the current paper the sorting operation is modeled in a general way that allows the investigation and comparison of various classification options with differences in accuracy and cost.Section 2 presents a review of the related literature and further clarifies the positioning and contribution of this paper. Section 3 explains in detail the problem setting and the basic assumptions of the model. In Section 4, the mathematical formulation is developed and the optimality conditions are examined. Section 5 compares three alternative supply chain structures differing with respect to existence and location of sorting operations that can classify used products in two classes according to their remanufacturability potential. Section 6 concentrates on the special case of identical collection sites deriving properties of the optimal acquisition policy and simple expressions for the selection of the best network configuration. Section 7 studies analytically the impact of different degrees of sorting accuracy and respective costs on the need for sorting and the optimal location of the sorting operation, if needed. Section 8 contains a numerical study that provides additional insights regarding the impact of returns quality, the number of available collection sites and the supply chain structure on acquisition and remanufacturing quantities and total system profitability. Finally, Section 9 summarizes the main results and concludes the paper. Appendix A contains the formulation of the expected profit function for RSC with sorting. All proofs are included in Appendix B.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The present paper examines simultaneously the issues of multiple collection sites, uncertain quality and inaccurate classification of returns in reverse supply chains. It sheds light on the close relationship between classification characteristics (cost and accuracy) and the optimal structure and profitability of the supply chain. The three alternative network configurations examined, differ in the degree in which they proactively classify returned units, in order to apply the proper action (dispose of or remanufacture). At the one extreme, we have the system with sorting at CS which evaluates quality before investing any effort on returns. At the other end, the system without sorting does not exploit sorting technology to obtain timely quality information. Our analytical findings provide insights and a number of directions, useful for the management of recovery operations with a diversity of characteristics.The presence of a procedure that identifies accurately the remanufacturability of returned products enables the decomposition of the acquisition and remanufacturing lot-sizing into two independent problems. In actual reverse supply chains, this decomposition point is the disassembly procedure, which according to the related literature can be considered as the point of accurate quality assessment of returned units. The optimal remanufacturing quantity depends only on the characteristics of the reverse supply chain upstream of returns disassembly, i.e., the part of the supply chain close to customers (shown as remanufacturing stage 3 in Fig. 2). On the other hand, the optimal decisions related with the reverse supply chain downstream of disassembly ensure the availability of adequate quantity of used units to be remanufactured at the right cost.Regarding the establishment of procedures to acquire early information on returns quality, our analysis proves that its advisability increases when the expected yield of the collected quantity is lower, since classification facilitates efficient handling of the non-remanufacturable units. Actually, we prove that when the different returns streams available (i.e. CS) are identical in terms of quality and cost, the optimal system configuration depends on the quality of returns only through its expected value. On the other hand, in the case of non-identical CS the shape of quality distribution can also impact the related decisions. Furthermore, we specify relatively simple ratios, r(01), r(02), r(12), which are critical for the determination of the need for sorting in the RSC and its optimal location. We also provide a detailed analysis of the impact and interactions of the related cost parameters. Our results indicate the importance of information on the qualitative characteristics of the available or possible supply sources. If a preliminary analysis indicates similarity of the supply sources, the relevant tactical and operational decisions can be based exclusively on the yield expectation. Otherwise, a more detailed examination of quality distributions is necessary.Another interesting finding is that the optimization of the sorting location increases the optimal acquisition quantity, resulting in advanced exploitation of the collected quantity.One of the most distinctive characteristics of the present research is that the defining elements of timely sorting procedures are studied in depth. We provide a detailed mapping of the impact of sorting accuracy on the optimal sorting location, taking into account the interactions with the related cost parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate the large impact of the accuracy and cost of the sorting operation, as well as, the strictness of the classification criteria on both the optimal system configuration and the overall profitability. Our analysis indicates that the advisability of the three alternative systems demonstrates different sensitivity to the two error types. Based on these findings, it is necessary to stress the need for explicit consideration of sorting accuracy during the decision making process. Unfortunately, there is a lack of published studies on the performance of the existing quality assessment technology with regard to their cost, accuracy and magnitude of each type of misclassification errors. In addition, more detailed analyses regarding the suitability of the sorting criteria and their correlation with products remanufacturabilty are necessary.Our research also provides some interesting findings regarding the extent of the collection network and the exploitation of additional supply sources. We provide a condition to calculate a bound, beyond which a certain CS cannot be considered as a profitable supply source. On the other hand, we prove that the addition of new CS can be beneficial for an RSC because it can result in reduced variability (uncertainty) of the returns quality, even if the expected yield is worse compared to the existing suppliers base. Since the economic benefits from the activation of additional CS are related to uncertainty reduction, these benefits reduce as the number of CS increases. In an extreme scenario in which yield variability vanishes, multi-sourcing is not advantageous. Moreover, since RSC characterized by low returns yield have lower profit margins, exploitation of the availability of multiple supply sources is more crucial in these cases.Among the issues that are closely related to the current work, but for a diversity of reasons are not studied here, are limited supply of used products, multi-period planning and availability of multiple quality grades of remanufacturing units. Inclusion of some or all of these features in our model constitutes interesting extensions for future research.The inclusion of a sorting operation either at stage 1 or at stage 2 modifies (3) as follows.•Sorting at stage 1:(A.1)E[TP(1)(sr,s1,…,sN)]=(v+cb+cd1)×(∫0srxf(x)dx−∫q1=0min(sr(1−α)s1,1)∫q2=0min(sr−S′1(1−α)s2,1)…∫qk=0min(sr−S′k−1(1−α)sk,1)…×∫qN=0min(sr−S′N−1(1−α)sN,1)AN(sr,S′N,q1,…,qN)dqN…dq1)−∑i=1N(cs+δ)si−∑i=1N(cr1(i)+cr2+cd)×{(1−α)E(qi)+β[1−E(qi)]}si−cbE(x).Sorting at stage 2:(A.2)E[TP(2)(sr,s1,…,sN)]=(v+cb+cd1)×(∫0srxf(x)dx−∫q1=0min(sr(1−α)s1,1)∫q2=0min(sr−S′1(1−α)s2,1)…∫qk=0min(sr−S′k−1(1−α)sk,1)…×∫qN=0min(sr−S′N−1(1−α)sN,1)AN(sr,S′N,q1,…,qN)dqN…dq1)−∑i=1N(cr1(i)+cs+cd)si−cr2∑i=1N{(1−α)E(qi)+β[1−E(qi)]}si−cbE(x),where(A.3)Sk′=(1−α)∑i=1ksiqi,1<k≤N.Note that the area of multiple integration in (A.1) and (A.2) differs from the one in (3) in that the upper integration limits are defined by the number of correctly classified remanufacturable units,(1−α)si, instead of the number of units procured by each CS, si,Setting:Λ(α,sr,s1,…,sN)=(v+cb+cd1)×(∫0srxf(x)dx−∫q1=0min(sr(1−α)s1,1)∫q2=0min(sr−S′1(1−α)s2,1)…∫qk=0min(sr−S′k−1(1−α)sk,1)…×∫qN=0min(sr−S′N−1(1−α)sN,1)AN(sr,S′N,q1,…,qN)dqN…dq1)−cbE(x),Ψ(0)(sr,s1,…,sN)=∑i=1N(cr1(i)+cr2+cd)siΨ(1)(sr,s1,…,sN)=∑i=1N(cs+δ)si+∑i=1N(cr1(i)+cr2+cd){(1−α)E(qi)+β[1−E(qi)]}si,andΨ(2)(sr,s1,…,sN)=∑i=1N(cr1(i)+cs+cd)si+cr2∑i=1N{(1−α)E(qi)+β[1−E(qi)]}si,the expected profit functions for the three alternative system configurations can be written, respectively, as follows:•no sorting:(A.4)E[TP(0)(sr,s1,…,sN)]=Λ(0,sr,s1,…,sN)−Ψ(0)(sr,s1,…,sN),sorting at stage 1 (CS):(A.5)E[TP(1)(sr,s1,…,sN)]=Λ(α,sr,s1,…,sN)−Ψ(1)(sr,s1,…,sN),sorting at stage 2 (R):(A.6)E[TP(2)(sr,s1,…,sN)]=Λ(α,sr,s1,…,sN)−Ψ(2)(sr,s1,…,sN),In order tooptimize the acquisition quantities and to compare the profitability of the three alternative RSC configurations it is necessary to study the first and second order derivatives of the objective functions in (A.4)–(A.6). Differentiating the objective function with respect to si(i = 1,… N) under the three alternative system configurations results in the expressions (A.7)–(A.9).(A.7)∂E[TP(0)(sr,s1,…,sN)]/∂si=λi(0,sr,s1,…,sN)−ψi(0),(A.8)∂E[TP(1)(sr,s1,…,sN)]/∂si=λi(α,sr,s1,…,sN)−ψi(1),(A.9)∂E[TP(2)(sr,s1,…,sN)]/∂si=λi(α,sr,s1,…,sN)−ψi(2),whereλi(α,sr,s1,…,sN)=(v+cb+cd1)∫q1=0min(sr(1−α)s1,1)∫q2=0min(sr−S′1(1−α)s2,1)…∫qN=0min(sr−S′N−1(1−α)sN,1)×(1−α)qi[F(sr)−F(S′N)]g1(q1)…gN(qN)dqN…dq1,ψi(0)=∂Ψ(0)(sr,s1,…,sN)/∂si=(cr2+cd+cr1(i)),ψi(1)=∂Ψ(1)(sr,s1,…,sN)/∂si=(cs+δ)+ψi(0){(1−α)E(qi)+β[1−E(qi)]},andψi(2)=∂Ψ(2)(sr,s1,…,sN)/∂si=(cr1(i)+cs+cd)+ccr2{(1−α)E(qi)+β[1−E(qi)]},for i = 1, … , N.Taking the derivatives of (A.7)–(A.9) with respect to sk, k = 1, … , N, yields the second-order mixed (k ≠ i) and partial (k = i) derivatives, for j = 0, 1, 2:(A.10)∂2E[TP(j)(sr,s1,…,sN)]/∂si∂sk=−(v+cb+cd1)∫q1=0min(sr(1−α)s1,1)∫q2=0min(sr−S′1(1−α)s2,1)…∫qN=0min(sr−S′N−1(1−α)sN,1)×(1−α)2qiqkf(S′N)g1(q1)…gN(qN)dqN…dq1<0.Note that the second order derivatives (A.10) are identical for the three alternative system configurations, setting α = 0 for the system configuration without sorting. To simplify notation we drop the index j from TP(j) when the derivations apply to all three systems.Proof of Lemma 1Generally, the support of qi, i = 1, … , N, is in [0, 1] and therefore the support of sNqNis in [0, sN] while the support of SN-1 is in [0,∑i=1N−1si]. Depending on the relationships between sN, SN-1 and sr, the line sr= sNqN+ SN-1 can be in one of five alternative positions on the (SN−1,sNqN) plane, as shown in Fig. B.1. For example, consider Case (II) withSr>∑i=1N−1siand sr< sN: SN-1 can take any value in its support without violating the constraintSN−1<Sr, while the sNqNvalues are constrained by the linesr−SN−1=sNqN. Thus, qNtakes values in the interval [0,(sr−SN−1)/sN]. Likewise we can derive the integration area of SN-1 and qNfor each of the five possible relationships among∑i=1N−1si, sN,∑i=1N−1si+SNand sr, corresponding to cases (I)–(V), as shown in Fig. B.1.For each of these cases the area of integration 0 ≤ SN= sNqN+ SN-1 ≤ sris depicted as shaded area in Fig. B.1 and is described in detail in Table B.1. Note that the case where all available units are used to satisfy demand, is equivalent to setting sr→ ∞; then only case (V) would exist implying a much simpler objective function. In a similar fashion the integration areas of Si-1 and qi,i=N−1,…,1, are derived, given that S0 = 0.Since the use of five different expressions for the computation of the domain of integration is not convenient, we prefer to consolidate all five different forms shown in Table Α.1 in a single expression, i.e.,0≤qk≤min(sr−Sk−1sk,1). Hence, ΩΝ is expressed by the integration limits in the right-hand-side of the expression in Lemma 1.Proof of Lemma 2Without loss of generality, we assume that N ≥ k > i ≥ 1, and define ui, hk(q1) and hi(q1) as follows:ui=min(sr−S′i−1(1−α)si,1),i=1,…,NandS0′=0,hi(q1)≡∫q2=0u2…∫qk=0uk∫qk+1=0uk+1…∫qi=0ui∫qi+1=0ui+1…∫qN=0uNqi2ℏdqN…dq2,By applying the Cauchy–Bunyakovsky–Swartz inequality (CBS) on hk, hiyields:(B.1)∫q1=0u1[hi(q1)]2dq1·∫q1=0u1[hk(q1)]2dq1>(∫q1=0u1hi(q1)·hk(q1)dq1)2.The left-hand-side of (B.1) is equal to∂2E[TP(sr,s1,…,sN)]∂si2∂2E[TP(sr,s1,…,sN)]∂sk2,while applying CBS on the right-hand-side of (B.1) yields:(∫q1=0u1hi(q1)·hk(q1)dq1)2={∫q1=0u1(∫q2=0u2…∫qi=0ui∫qi+1=0ui+1…∫qk=0uk∫qk+1=0uk+1…∫qN=0uNqi2ℏdqN…dq2·∫q2=0u2…∫qi=0ui∫qi+1=0ui+1…∫qk=0uk∫qk+1=0uk+1…∫qN=0uNqk2ℏdqN…dq2)dq1}2>{∫q1=0u1[(∫q2=0u2∫q3=0u3…∫qi=0ui∫qi+1=0ui+1…∫qk=0uk∫qk+1=0uk+1…∫qN=0uNqi2ℏdqN…dq3·∫q3=0u3…∫qi=0ui∫qi+1=0ui+1…∫qk=0uk∫qk+1=0uk+1…∫qN=0uNqk2ℏdqN…dq3dq2)2]1/2dq1}2={∫q1=0u1∫q2=0u2(∫q3=0u3…∫qi=0ui∫qi+1=0ui+1…∫qk=0uk∫qk+1=0uk+1…∫qN=0uNqi2ℏdqN…dq3·∫qi=0ui∫qi+1=0ui+1…∫qk=0uk∫qk+1=0uk+1…∫qN=0uNqk2ℏdqN…dq3)dq2dq1}2.After repeated application of the CBS, we obtain(∫q1=0u1hi(q1)·hk(q1)dq1)2>{∫q1=0u1∫q2=0u2…∫qi=0uiqi…∫qk=0ukqk×(∫qk+1=0uk+1…∫qN=0uNℏdqN…dqk+1·∫qk+1=0uk+1…∫qN=0uNℏdqN…dqk+1dqk)…dqi…dq2dq1}2=(∫q1=0u1∫q2=0u2…∫qN=0uNqiqkℏdqN…dq1)2={∂2E[TP(s1,…,sN)]∂sk∂si}2.Therefore, it has been proven that∂2E[TP(sr,s1,…,sN)]∂sk2∂2E[TP(sr,s1,…,sN)]∂si2>{∂2E[TP(s1,…,sN)]∂sk∂si}2.Proof of Lemma 3Assume that for a RSC with (N−1) CS the optimal policy is to procure s1, s2, … , sN-1 units from CS1, CS2, … , CSN-1, respectively. Given that the first-order conditions are satisfied at this point, we have(B.2)∂E[TP(j)(sr,s1,…,sN−1)]/∂si=0,foreveryi=1,2,…,N−1.If CSNis added to the supplier base and the acquisition of sNunits is decided, then because of (A.10)(B.3)∂2E[TP(j)(sr,s1,…,sN−1,sN)]/∂si∂sN<0.Moreover, by (10)–(12) it is easy to show that(B.4)∂E[TP(j)(sr,s1,…,sN−1)]/∂si=∂E[TP(j)(sr,s1,…,sN−1,sN=0)]/∂siSince by (B.3)∂E[TP(j)(sr,s1,…,sN−1,sN)]/∂siis decreasing in sN, combining (B.2)–(B.4) proves that∂E[TP(j)(sr,s1,…,sN−1,sN>0)]/∂si<∂E[TP(j)(sr,s1,…,sN−1,sN=0)]/∂si=0,foreveryi=1,2,…,N−1.Thus, in order to satisfy the first order conditions for sN> 0 it is necessary to decrease at least one of s1, s2, … , sN-1 values.Proof of Proposition 1If for the system with sorting at stage 1 the acquisition quantities from the available CS are set equal to si(1) ≥ 0, i = 1, 2, … , N, while the acquisition quantities for the system without sorting are set equal tosi(0)=(1−α)si(1), i = 1, 2, … , N, by (A.4) and (A.5) the difference in the expected profit of the two systems equals:E[TP(0)(sr,(1−α)s1(1),…,(1−α)sN(1))]−E[TP(1)(sr,s1(1),…,sN(1))]=∑i=0Nsi(1){cs+δ−[cr2+cd+cr1(i)][1−E(qi)]·[1−(α+β)]}.Therefore, ifcs+δ−[cr2+cd+cr1(i)][1−E(qi)]·[1−(α+β)]has the same sign for all i = 1, … , N, then the most profitable system between systems 0 and 1 does not depend on the exact values of the acquisition quantities and can be determined based on the sign of the expression ri(01) - E(qi) for any value of i. That is, in such a case one of the two system configurations will be more profitable compared to the other for every possible set of acquisition quantities which satisfysi(0)=(1−α)si(1).Similarly, it can be proved thatE[TP(0)(sr,(1−α)s1(2),…,(1−α)sN(2))]−E[TP(2)(sr,s1(2),…,sN(2))]=∑i=1Nsi(2){cs+α(cd+cr1(i))−cr2[1−E(qi)]·[1−(α+β)]}.andE[TP(1)(sr,s1(1),…,sN(1))]−E[TP(2)(sr,s1(1),…,sN(1))]=∑i=1Nsi(1)[(cd+cr1(i))·{(1−β)−E(qi)·[1−(α+β)]}−δ].Therefore, the optimal network configuration can be determined by the conditions of Proposition 1.Proof of Proposition 2The proof is presented in two parts; in Part 1 we prove that for an RSC with N identical CS only policies with equal acquisition quantities from all available CS can be optimal. Then, in Part 2 we prove that the Hessian matrix of the expected profit function for N identical CS and equal acquisition quantities is negative definite. Therefore, the problem with N identical CS has a single global maximum for equal acquisition quantities.Part 1:For an RSC with N = 2 identical CS we know that at the optimal solution the acquisition quantities from CS1 and CS2 are equal: s1 = s2 (Zikopoulos & Tagaras, 2007). Consider now N = 3. For any given value of s1, by Lemma 2 and because of symmetry the acquisition quantities from CS2 and CS3 must be equal at the optimum: s2 = s3. Similarly, for any given s2, at the optimum we must have s1 = s3. Hence, the optimal solution for N = 3 must have s1 = s2 = s3. By extending the same argument to N > 3 we arrive at the conclusion that the optimal solution is characterized by equal acquisition quantities from all available CS:s1=s2=s3=⋯=sN.Part 2:For equal acquisition quantities from the N available identical CS, we define y and z as follows:y=∂2E[TP(sr,s1,…,sN)]∂si2,fori=1,…,Nandz=∂2E[TP(sr,s1,…,sN)]∂si∂sk,fori,k=1,…,N,i≠k.Then, the determinant of the Hessian matrix can be expressed as:|HN|=|yzz……zzzzyz……zzzzzy……zzz…………………………………………zzz……yzzzzz……zyzzzz……zzy|Subtracting column (1) from columns (2) to (N - 1), and consequently subtracting column (N) from column (1), yields:|HN|=|y−zz−yz−y……z−yz−yz0y−z0……00z00y−z……00z…………………………………………000……y−z0z000……0y−zzz−y00……00y|Adding rows (2) to (N - 1) to row (1) and adding row (1) to row (N) in the resulting matrix, the following upper triangular matrix is derived:|HN|=|y−z00……00(N−1)z0y−z0……00z00y−z……00z…………………………………………000……y−z0z000……0y−zz000……00y+(N−1)z|The value of the determinant of a triangular matrix is simply the product of the entries on the diagonal. Therefore, if we denote by |Hn| all leading principal minors of order n, for 1 ≤ n ≤ N, of the Hessian matrix of the expected profit function for equal acquisition quantities from the N ≥ 2 identical CS, we have|Hn|=(y−z)n,for1≤n≤N−1,and|HN|=(y−z)N−1[y+(N−1)z].Recall that by Lemma 2, y2 > z2 and that because of (A.10) y < 0 and z < 0. Hence,y−z<0,andy+(N−1)z<0.Therefore, (-1)n|Hn| > 0 for every n, 1 ≤ n ≤ N. Consequently, the Hessian matrix of the expected profit function for equal acquisition quantities is negative definite and the proof is completed.Proof of Lemma 4(a)Setting the acquisition quantity from each CS for the system with sorting at stage 1 equal to s(1) and for system without sorting equal tos(0)=(1−α)s(1), by (A.4) and (A.5), it can be shown that the difference in the expected profit for the two alternative systems simplifies to(B.5)E[TP(0)(sr,(1−α)s(1),…,(1−α)s(1))]−E[TP(1)(sr,s(1),…,s(1))]=N·s(1){cs+δ−ψ(0)[1−E(q)]·[1−(α+β)]},becauseΛ(0,sr,s(0),…,s(0))=Λ(α,sr,s(1),…,s(1)).Consequently, if (7) holds, then (B.5) proves that for any value of the acquisition quantity of the system with sorting at stage 1, s(1), including the optimal one, the expected profit will be lower than the expected profit of the system without sorting with acquisition quantity equal tos(0)=(1−α)s(1). In the opposite case, i.e., when (7) does not hold, the system with sorting at stage 1 will have higher expected profit.If the common acquisition quantity from all available CS for the system with sorting at stage 2 is equal to s(2), whereas the common acquisition quantity for the system without sorting is equal tos(0)=(1−α)s(2), by (A.4) and (A.6) after some manipulation we getE[TP(0)(sr,(1−α)s(2),…,(1−α)s(2))]−E[TP(2)(sr,s(2),…,s(2))]=N·s(2){cs+α(cd+cr1)−cr2[1−E(q)]·[1−(α+β)]}Therefore, E(TP(0)) > E(TP(2)) if and only if (8) holds.We compare the expected profit functions (A.5) and (A.6) for the systems with sorting at stages 1 and 2, respectively, for equal acquisition quantities,s(1)=s(2). SinceE[TP(1)(sr,s(1),…,s(1))]−E[TP(2)(sr,s(2),…,s(2))]=N·s(1)[(cd+cr1)·{(1−β)−E(q)·[1−(α+β)]}−δ],it is proven that the relative profitability of the two alternative network configurations depends on (9).The proof follows directly from the definitions of r(01), r(02),r(12) and Lemma 4.Here, we prove only case (a); the proofs for cases (b) and (c) are similar.Lets(j)*be the optimal (common) acquisition quantity from each available CS for system configuration j (j = 0, 1, 2). Using (A.4) and (A.5) it is easy to show that:(B.6)E[TP(0)(sr,(1−α)s(1)*,…,(1−α)s(1)*)]−E[TP(1)(sr,s(1)*,…,s(1)*)]=s(1)*{cs+δ−ψ(0)[1−E(q)]·[1−(α+β)]},and(B.7)E[TP(0)(sr,s(0)*,…,s(0)*)]−E[TP(1)(sr,s(0)*1−α,…,s(0)*1−α)]=s(0)*1−α{cs+δ−ψ(0)[1−E(q)]·[1−(α+β)]}Subtracting (B.6) from (B.7) yields:{E[TP(0)(sr,s(0)*,…,s(0)*)]−E[TP(1)(sr,s(0)*1−α,…,s(0)*1−α)]}−{E[TP(0)(sr,(1−α)s(1)*,…,(1−α)s(1)*)]−E[TP(1)(sr,s(1)*,…,s(1)*)]}=[s(0)*1−α−s(1)*]{cs+δ−ψ(0)[1−E(q)]·[1−(α+β)]}and by rearranging terms(B.8){E[TP(0)(sr,s(0)*,…,s(0)*)]−E[TP(0)(sr,(1−α)s(1)*,…,(1−α)s(1)*)]}+{E[TP(1)(sr,s(1)*,…,s(1)*)]−E[TP(1)(sr,s(0)*1−α,…,s(0)*1−α)]}=[s(0)*−(1−α)s(1)*]cs+δ−ψ(0)[1−E(q)]·[1−(α+β)](1−α)Sinces(0)*ands(1)*are the optimal acquisition quantities for systems 0 and 1 respectively, the left-hand-side term of (B.8) is always positive. Therefore,s(0)*−(1−α)s(1)*>0if and only ifcs+δ−ψ(0)[1−E(q)]·[1−(α+β)]>0, which completes the proof.
