@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study assessed the combined effect of physical and psychosocial/organisational and/or environmental factors on the presence of musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) and its consequences (reduced activities and absenteeism due to MSS) in a random sample of 3003 workers in New Zealand. By telephone interview, participants reported their current workplace exposures and MSS (neck/shoulder, arm/elbow, wrist and low back) and its consequences. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Combined exposure to physical and psychosocial/organisational and/or environmental factors increased the odds of MSS in the neck/shoulder (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.79–5.52), arms/elbow regions (OR 4.14, 95% CI 2.21–7.76) and low back (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.28–2.37) and its consequences, i.e. reduced activities due to neck/shoulder symptoms (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.28–13.00), absenteeism due to neck/shoulder symptoms (OR 5.19, 95% CI 2.24–12.01) and absenteeism due to low back symptoms (OR 4.37, 95% CI 2.92–6.53). In contrast, favourable psychosocial/organisational work conditions reduced the odds of wrist symptoms due to poor physical work conditions (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.44–3.34). We conclude that to reduce MSS and its consequences, employers need to adopt a multifaceted approach: concentrate on improving physical conditions as well as the psychosocial/organisational and environmental aspects of the working environment.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) are common among general and working populations. They are most prevalent in the low back, followed by the neck or shoulder (Holmström and Engholm, 2003; Lei et al., 2005; Palliser et al., 2005; Scuffham et al., 2010; Widanarko et al., 2011; Wijnhoven et al., 2006), or upper extremities (Choobineh et al., 2007; Leroux et al., 2005).Physical work factors have a major role in the development of MSS, such as awkward posture (Ariëns et al., 2000; Bernard, 1997; Heneweer et al., 2011; Lotters et al., 2003; NRC & IOM, 2001), repetitive movements (Bernard, 1997; Devereux et al., 2004), manual material handling (Bernard, 1997; Lotters et al., 2003; NRC & IOM, 2001) and vibration (Bernard, 1997; Lotters et al., 2003; NRC & IOM, 2001). However, during the last two decades, a number of studies and systematic reviews have shown that psychosocial risk factors also play a role in the development of MSS. These include high job strain (Ijzelenberg et al., 2004), high psychological demands (Ariëns et al., 2001; Hooftman et al., 2009; Ijzelenberg et al., 2004), low decision latitude (Bernard, 1997; Bongers et al., 1993), low social support (Ariëns et al., 2001; Bernard, 1997; Bongers et al., 1993; Hoogendoorn et al., 2000), job dissatisfaction (Bernard, 1997; Hoogendoorn et al., 2000; Linton, 2001; Lotters et al., 2003), effort-reward imbalance (Rugulies and Krause, 2008) and high work stress (Linton, 2000, 2001). As a result, some recent studies (Andersen et al., 2003; Engholm and Holmström, 2005; Hooftman et al., 2009; Jensen et al., 2012; Krause et al., 2010; Widanarko et al., 2012a) have included both physical and psychosocial factors as candidate exposure variables in multivariate models developed to estimate risk factors for MSS.Theoretical models by Davis and Heaney (2000), Karsh (2006) and Widanarko et al. (2013) indicate that both physical and psychosocial factors may independently influence MSS and that both factors may interact. While this is a biologically plausible hypothesis, few studies have quantified the combined effect of these factors on MSS risk (Huang et al., 2003; Lapointe et al., 2009; Linton, 2005; Waters et al., 2007, 2011). To date, most studies have shown that the risk of MSS due to combination of physical and psychosocial factors is greater than the risk of MSS when a single factor is present (Devereux et al., 2004, 1999, 2002; Huang et al., 2003; Lapointe et al., 2009; Östergren et al., 2005; Vandergrift et al., 2012; Wahlstrom et al., 2004; Waters et al., 2007, 2011; Widanarko, 2013). For example, Huang et al. (2003) found that the combination of high biomechanical pressure and time pressure significantly increased the risk of low back symptoms (LBS) (odds ratio (OR) 2.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39–4.91) and upper extremities symptoms (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.49–5.66), whereas the risk of LBS or upper extremities symptoms due to exposed to single exposure (either biomechanical pressure or time pressure) was between 0.46 and 1.05. Similarly, Devereux et al. (2004), in a 15-month cohort study of the general working population in the UK showed that those exposed to both high physical and psychosocial risk factors had the highest risk of LBS (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.30–6.18), neck symptoms (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.33–3.61), elbow/forearms symptoms (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.02–3.46), and wrist symptoms (WS) (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.76–5.61) compared with those exposed to a single exposure.Whilst MSS per se may seriously impact the health and productivity of employees and employers, its consequences (reduced activities and absenteeism) reflect the real/practical impact of the problem. The 12-month period prevalence of reduced activities due to MSS has been estimated to be anywhere between 4% and 42% (Chen et al., 2005; Scuffham et al., 2010; Widanarko et al., 2012b). It is around 1–36% for absenteeism due to MSS (Alexopoulos et al., 2008; Bovenzi and Betta, 1994; Bovenzi et al., 2002; Cunningham et al., 2006; Ghaffari et al., 2006; Ijzelenberg et al., 2004; Matsudaira et al., 2011; Scuffham et al., 2010; Widanarko et al., 2012b). To the best of the authors' knowledge, very few studies (Fernandes et al., 2009; Lapointe et al., 2009; Thorbjörnsson et al., 2000) have examined the combined effect of risk factors at work for MSS consequences. The few studies that have attempted to do so have specifically examined the combined effect on MSS consequences and found that the combination of poor posture and job strain significantly increased the risk of reduced activities due to LBS (OR 5.51, 95% CI 2.33–13.03) and reduced activities due to neck/shoulder symptoms (NSS) (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.58–7.22) among females (Lapointe et al., 2009). Thorbjörnsson et al. (2000) examined the combined effect of physical and psychosocial risk factors on absenteeism due to LBS and reported that exposure to both increased the risk of absenteeism due to LBS. Although environmental factors may play a role in the occurrence of MSS and absenteeism due to MSS (Harkness et al., 2003; Piedrahita et al., 2004; Widanarko et al., 2012b), none of the studies cited above included environmental factors in their analyses.With this background, the objective of this study was to quantify the combined effect of physical and psychosocial/organisational and/or environmental factors for MSS and its consequences (reduced activities and absenteeism due to MSS) for the body regions: neck/shoulder; arm/elbow; wrist; low back.
