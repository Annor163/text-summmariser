@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Issues related to space–time adaptivity for a class of nonlinear and time-dependent problems are discussed. The dG(k)-methods are adopted for the time integration, and the a posteriori error control is based on the appropriate dual problem in space–time. One key ingredient is to decouple the error generation in space and time with a hierarchical decomposition of the discrete space of dual solutions. The main idea put forward in the paper is to increase the computational efficiency of the adaptive scheme by avoiding recursive adaptations of the whole time-mesh; rather, the space-mesh and the time-step defining each finite space–time slab are defined in a truly sequential fashion.The proposed adaptive strategy is applied to the coupled consolidation problem in geomechanics involving large deformations. Its performance is investigated with the aid of a numerical example in 2D.1.Computezh|Sn(k)based onzh(tn−1−)that was computed for the previous time slabSn−1. Then, solve for the enhanced dual solutionz̃∗|Sn(k)from the decoupled dual problemAn∗(zh(k);δz∗,z̃∗(k))=Ln∗(zh(k);δz∗,z̃H∗(tn+)),whereby it is noted thatz̃∗(tn+)has been replaced by the background dual solutionz̃H∗(tn+)as the load (or data) for the current space–time slab.Compute the error contributionsEn,SOL(k),E(s)n,FEM(k), etc.Check the stopping criterion in (68): IfEn(k)≤TOLΔtn(k)Tthen exit and take a new time step.Refine the space-mesh, the time interval or both: Ifα−E(t)n,FEM(k)≤E(s)n,FEM(k)≤α+E(t)n,FEM(k)then refine in space and time uniformly.Else ifα+E(t)n,FEM(k)≤E(s)n,FEM(k)then refine in space:Mh,n(k)→Mh,n(k+1),In(k)=In(k+1)Else ifE(s)n,FEM(k)≤α−E(t)n,FEM(k)then refine in time:In(k)→In(k+1),Mh,n(k)=Mh,n(k+1)

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
One of the classical coupled field problems in continuum mechanics is the time-dependent deformation of a porous medium, when the pores are (partly) filled with a fluid, cf. de Boer  [1]. In soil mechanics, this is denoted the consolidation problem (pertinent to fine-grained soils like clay) in the case of quasistatic loading, i.e. when acceleration of both the solid skeleton and the pore fluid can be ignored. A wealth of literature has been devoted to the finite element solution of the coupled poroelasticity problem and its generalization to include materially nonlinear and rate-dependent effects; cf. Booker and coworkers [2–4], Runesson [5]. However, as it appears from the literature, very little attention has been paid to global error estimation and adaptive finite element techniques, in particular the appropriate space–time adaptive strategies. Limited attempts are those of Aubry et al.  [6] and Hicks  [7], who considered pure space-adaptivity, and those of Runesson et al. [8] and Larsson et al.  [9], who considered pure time-adaptivity.The general space–time adaptive procedure is far more challenging, cf., e.g., Eriksson et al.  [10,11], Rannacher  [12], Díez and Calderón [13], Ladevèze et al.  [14] and Hoffman  [15]. In particular when there is a strong transport phenomena, such as in structural dynamics, cf. Verdugo et al.  [16], the optimal spatial mesh varies dramatically with time. Hence, there is a great need for arbitrary space–time adaptivity. Such a general scheme requires recursive adaptations of the whole space–time-mesh. In addition, existing error estimators for global error control in space–time require extensive data storage in terms of saving the complete time–history of the entire solution, cf. Chamoin and Ladevèze  [17], Parés et al.  [18,19] and Waeytens et al.  [20]. Attempts of circumventing the need for such a complete recursive strategy normally involves global error control in space while restricting to local error control in time, cf. Aubry et al.  [6].In this paper, we present a strategy for obtaining global error control in quantities of interest via time-sequential space–time adaptivity, whereby the need for recursive computations and excessive data storage is avoided. In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to identify the error generation in space and time separately. This can be accomplished via a hierarchical decomposition of the discrete (finite element based) dual space. Indeed, this is a novel feature that is pursued in the present paper.The paper is outlined as follows: To begin with, a quite broad class of time-dependent and nonlinear coupled problems is discussed in an abstract variational setting in space–time, whereby the framework is sufficiently general to allow for discontinuous discretization in time. Hence, the framework accommodates the dG(k)-methods. Next, the formally exact a posteriori error representation formula is presented for the space–time format, which is based on the solution of an appropriate dual problem. With such a formulation it is possible to choose any goal-oriented error measure in space–time, which is of engineering interest, cf. Prudhomme and Oden [21], Larsson et al.  [22], Stein et al.  [23]. The resulting error formula is manipulated (approximated) to allow for the identification of pure space error and pure time error, respectively. In particular, we discuss a sequential-adaptive strategy that involves adaptive change of the current space–time slab only in order to avoid full recursive adaptivity of the whole time–history.Next, we apply the general strategy to the nonlinear consolidation problem in poromechanics. We then choose to control the error in displacement and pore pressure at a given spatial point after given time has elapsed or during a certain interval of time. The numerical results thoroughly demonstrate the good performance of the proposed sequential-adaptive algorithm. In particular, it is shown that the precision (in terms of effectivity index) can be quite acceptable for the considered problem; however, it is also noted that the optimal time-mesh is very sensitive to the particular choice of the goal function in space–time.We shall establish the variational format in the space–time domainS=defΩ×I, for given spatial domainΩand time domainI=(0,T), for a quite broad class of problems involving a first order time-derivative. In particular, the coupled problem of consolidation of geomaterials falls within this class. Another interesting application is the problem of dynamics, rewritten in first-order form, i.e. through a Hamiltonian description. It is of considerable interest to note from the outset that, due to the forward transport of information in time, it is always possible to consider a set of finite time intervals, whereby the solution at the end of any such interval will act as the initial data for the next one. To this end, we introduce a partition0=t0<t1<⋯<tN=Tof the considered time domainI=(0,T)into time-intervalsIn=(tn−1,tn)of lengthΔtn=tn−tn−1.11The abbreviated notationΔt=Δtnwill be used henceforth for the current time step associated withIn.Hence, we define space–time slabsSn=defΩ×Insuch that the space–time domain can be given asS=defΩ×I=S1∪S2⋯∪Sn.Next, we introduce the spaceC(S′)defined on a space–time slabS′=defΩ×I′for a time-intervalI′⊆I. The spaceC(S′)is spanned by all functions for which (i) the weak form of the problem at hand is well-defined onS′, and (ii) the Dirichlet-type boundary conditions on the (spatial) boundary ofΩare fulfilled. In conjunction with the solution spaceC, we introduce the test-spaceC0(S′)that consists of functions that fulfill the same regularity requirements onS′as the functions in the solution space, but where the functions are homogeneous on the Dirichlet part of the boundary ofΩ. We thus obtain the relationz+δz∈C(S′)for any two functionsz∈C(S′)andδz∈C0(S′).As a further preliminary, we also introduce the time-dependent spatial variational formsa(z;δz)(t′)=a(z|t=t′;δz|t=t′),(z,δz)(t′)=(z|t=t′,δz|t=t′)andl(δz)(t′)=l(δz|t=t′)onΩfor functionsz∈C(S′)andδz∈C0(S′)defined onS′=Ω×I′withI′∋t′.22In the following, we shall omit the time variable following the spatial forms while keeping in mind thata(•;•),(•;•)andl(•)are actually functions in time in the case the arguments are space–time functions.The forma(z;δz)is semi-linear (non-linear inzbut linear inδz) and corresponds to the spatial weak form of the problem,(z,δz)is the bi-linear scalar product inL2(Ω), andl(δz)is a linear functional that represents data to the problem. Such data are load/source in the interior ofΩand natural boundary conditions on the Neumann boundary part ofΩ. Moreover, we introduce the (generally non-linear) differential operatorΦ[z]in space that corresponds to a conservation quantity, i.e., the space–time PDE describes the evolution ofΦ[z]. We thus study a problem of which the spatial weak form, which is often utilized in conventional semi-discrete formulations, reads as follows:(1)(dtΦ,δz)+a(z;δz)=l(δz)t∈[0,T],wheredtdenotes the time derivative. The initial condition is given asΦ[z]=Φ0whent=t0=0.Employing the time-dependent variational forms in space introduced above, we establish the full variational forms in space–time as follows:(2)A(z;δz)=def∑n=1N∫In[(dtΦ[z],δz)+a(z;δz)]dt+(Φ[z(t0+)],δz(t0+))+∑n=2N(〚Φ[z]〛(tn−1),δz(tn−1+))(3)L(δz)=def∑n=1N∫Inl(δz)dt+(Φ[z0],δz(t0+)),wherez0represents the given initial value onzthat is satisfied only in weak form in general, and where〚Φ〛(t)=defΦ(t+)−Φ(t−)denotes the jump ofΦat timet. From the construction of these forms, it is clear that we consider the situation when bothzandδzmay be time-discontinuous. Hence, we introduce the spaces of time-discontinuous functions(4)D={z:z|Sn∈nD=defC(Sn),n=1,2,…,N},(5)D0={z:z|Sn∈nD0=defC0(Sn),n=1,2,…,N}.Here, we recall thatC(Sn)denotes the space of functions onSnthat have sufficient regularity inside the slab, and that satisfy essential boundary conditions on the Dirichlet part of the boundary ofΩ. The functions inC0(Sn)possess the same regularity properties; however, they are homogeneous on the Dirichlet part of the boundary ofΩ. From the construction ofDandD0in (4) and (5), respectively, we thus conclude thatz+δz∈Dfor any two functionsz∈Dandδz∈D0.We are now in the position to formulate the variational problem in space–time as follows: Findz∈Dsuch that(6)A(z;δz)=L(δz)∀δz∈D0,which is completely equivalent to Eq. (1) due to the choice of infinite-dimensional trial and test spaces in time.For later use, we introduce the residual of any givenz̄∈Das(7)R(z̄;δz)=L(δz)−A(z̄;δz),and it follows from (6) thatR(z;δz)=0. Moreover, we define the tangent form ofA, denotedA′, as the Gâteaux derivative(8)A′(z;δz,δz∗)=defddϵA(z+ϵδz∗;δz)|ϵ=0=∑n=1N∫In[(dtΦ′[z;δz∗],δz)+a′(z;δz,δz∗)]dt+(Φ′[z(t0+);δz∗(t0+)],δz(t0+))+∑n=2N(〚Φ′[z;δz∗]〛(tn−1),δz(tn−1+)).In (8), we introduced the derivatives(9)a′(z;δz,δz∗)=defddϵa(z+ϵδz∗;δz)|ϵ=0,(10)Φ′[z;δz∗]=defddϵΦ[z+ϵδz∗]|ϵ=0.Now, because of the forward transport of information in time mentioned above, it is sufficient to consider the “incremental form” of (6) applied to the space–time slabsSnin sequence as follows: Findz|Sn∈nDsuch that(11)A1(z;δz)=L1(δz)∀δz∈1D0,(12)An(z;δz)=Ln(z(tn−1−);δz)∀δz∈nD0,n>1wherez(tn−1−)is known from the previous increment. In ((11), (12)), we introduced the incremental forms(13)An(z;δz)=def∫In[(dtΦ[z],δz)+a(z;δz)]dt+(Φ[z(tn−1+)],δz(tn−1+)),(14)L1(δz)=def∫I1l(δz)dt+(Φ0,δz(t0+)),(15)Ln(z(tn−1−);δz)=def∫Inl(δz)dt+(Φ[z(tn−1−)],δz(tn−1+)),n>1.RemarkFollowing the literature, e.g. Eriksson et al.  [11], we may identify a fictitious “initial value”z(t0−)from the identity(16)(Φ[z(t0−)],δz(t0+))=(Φ0,δz(t0+)),whereby ((12), (15)) hold also forn=1. Henceforth, we tacitly use this identity independent on whetherz(t0−)actually exists or not; hence, the relation (12) is valid also forn=1.□We may construct the residual pertinent to eachSnas(17)Rn(z̄;δz)=Ln(z̄(tn−1−);δz)−An(z̄;δz)for any functionz̄∈D. In view of ((11), (12)), the exact solution,z, satisfies(18)Rn(z;δz)=0∀δz∈nD0for each incrementn=1,…,N. Clearly, the solution that satisfies all the incremental problems ((11), (12)) also solves the global problem (6), since we have the important identity(19)∑n=1NRn(z;δz)=R(z;δz)for any functionsz∈Dandδz∈D0.For later use, we now define the tangent form ofAn, denotedAn′, as the Gâteaux derivative(20)An′(z;δz,δz∗)=defddϵAn(z+ϵδz∗;δz)|ϵ=0=(Φ′[z(tn−1+);δz∗(tn−1+)],δz(tn−1+))+∫In[(dtΦ′[z;δz∗],δz)+a′(z;δz,δz∗)]dtwhere we recall the spatial Gâteaux derivatives defined in (9) and (10).RemarkNote that the introduction of time-discontinuities so far is not an approximation. Comparing with the more straightforward presentation, i.e. in Eriksson et al.  [10], the sum of time-intervals in the global problem (6) should rather be viewed as a set of sequential (exact) variational problems of standard character.□We introduce finite element approximations in both space and time. For the time-discretization we shall adopt the class of dG(k)-methods,k≥0, withk=0as the basic choice. The temporal mesh-function is common for all spatial points and given by the partitioningI=⋃n=1NInas defined in the previous subsection, whereas the spatial meshhn(X),X∈Ω, is associated with the triangulation ofΩthat is unique to eachIn,n=1,…,N. As a result, the space–time mesh is piecewise prismatic on eachSn.33This is a result of adopting a dG-method; the situation becomes slightly different when a cG-method is adopted.With these preliminaries we may now formulate the finite element problem. Since we adopt discontinuous Galerkin (dG), we utilize the weak format based on discontinuous solution and test spaces, cf. Section  2.1.2. In standard fashion, we thus seek the finite element solutionzh∈Dh⊂Dsuch that(21)A(zh;δzh)=L(δzh)∀δzh∈Dh0⊂D0,where we recall the weak form (6). Introducing the finite element spaces related to the triangulationhn(X)asnVhandnVh0for the trial and test-spaces, respectively, we define the FE-spaces for a dG(k)-method in time as follows:(22)nDh=nVh×Pk(In),nDh0=nVh0×Pk(In),wherePk(In)denotes polynomials of orderkin time on the intervalIn.We note that the residual of the FE-solutionzh∈Dhis given from (7) as(23)R(zh;δz)=L(δz)−A(zh;δz)=A(z;δz)−A(zh;δz)for arbitraryδz∈D0, where (6) was used to give the last equality. Finally, the (non-linear) Galerkin orthogonality(24)R(zh;δzh)=0∀δzh∈Dh0follows from (21).In practice, we consider the “incremental form” (18) on space–time slabsSn, in sequence forn=1,2,…,N, as follows: Findzh|Sn∈nVh×Pk(In)such that(25)An(zh;δzh)=Ln(zh(tn−1−);δzh)∀δzh∈nVh0×Pk(In),wherez(tn−1−)is known from the previous increment. The incremental formsAnandLnwere given in (13) and (15).In general, (25) is non-linear and we have to adopt an iterative solution strategy. Here, we propose Newton iterations as the basic method, which requires the Gâteaux derivative ofAn, as defined in (20), and the residual of (25), as defined in (17),(26)Rn(z̄;δz)=defLn(z̄(tn−1−);δz)−An(z̄;δz).For the time intervalIn, we thus iterate forl=1,2,…,(27)zh(l+1)|Sn=zh(l)|Sn+dzh,until (25) is satisfied within a given tolerance. In each Newton-step, we solve for the updatedzh∈Vh0×Pk(In)such that(28)An′(zh(l);δzh,dzh)=Rn(zh(l);δzh)∀δzh∈nVh0×Pk(In).In particular, we shall employ the simple dG(0)-method of piecewise constant functions in time, i.e.zh(X,t)=nzh(X)fort∈In. In practice this means to solve for the spatial solutionsnzh∈nVhfor each time-stepIn.44The only way thatnVhdiffers for different values ofnis that the Dirichlet boundary conditions may change with time. In fact, even the extension of the Dirichlet part of the boundary may be time-dependent.The FE-problem, now purely spatial, thus reads: Forn=1,…,N, findnzh∈nVhsuch that55For brevity the notationδzhis used for functions innVh0×Pk(In)as well as for functions innVh0. This is the case in (29).(29)Rn(nzh;δzh)=Δt[〈l(δzh)〉n−a(nzh;δzh)]−(Φ[nzh]−Φ[n−1zh],δzh)=0∀δzh∈nVh0or(30)(Φ[nzh],δzh)+Δta(nzh;δzh)=(Φ[n−1zh],δzh)+Δt〈l(δzh)〉n∀δzh∈nVh0,where〈l〉ndenotes the mean value oflonIn, i.e.(31)〈l〉n=def1Δt∫Inldt,andn−1zh∈n−1Vhis known from the previous time-step.66In analogy with the Remark above, we make the tacit interpretation(Φ[0zh],δzh)=(Φ0,δzh)∀δzh∈1Vh0, whereby (29) is valid also forn=1.The Gâteaux-derivativeAn′, used in the Newton-iterations, becomes(32)An′(zh;δzh,δzh∗)=(Φ′[nzh;δzh∗],δzh)+Δta′(nzh;δzh,δzh∗).The Newton-step, given by (28), can thus be rephrased more explicitly as(33)(Φ′[nzh(l);dzh],δzh)+Δta′(nzh(l);δzh,dzh)=Rn(zh(l);δzn)∀δzh∈nVh0.We wish to control the error of the FE-solutionzh∈Dhin terms of a scalar goal functionQ(z)of engineering interest, and we define the error as(34)E(z,zh)=defQ(z)−Q(zh).It is noted thatQ(z)does not need to be a norm, nor does it need to be a linear functional ofz.Withz̄(s)=defzh+s(z−zh),e=z−zh, we define the secant formsASandQSas follows:(35)A(z;δz)−A(zh;δz)=∫01ddsA(z̄(s);δz)ds=∫01A′(z̄(s);δz,e)ds=defAS(z,zh;δz,e),(36)Q(z)−Q(zh)=∫01ddsQ(z̄(s))ds=∫01Q′(z̄(s);e)ds=defQS(z,zh;e).In (36), we introduced the tangent formQ′(z;δz∗)as the Gâteaux-derivative ofQin complete analogy withA′in (8).Next, we introduce the appropriate dual solutionz∗∈D0, which solves the (generally nonlinear) dual problem(37)AS(•;z∗,δz∗)=QS(•;δz∗),∀δz∗∈D0.We then obtain, by definition, the error representation(38)E(•)=(36)QS(•;e)=(37)AS(•;z∗,e)=(35), (23)R(zh;z∗).In practice, it is necessary to introduce approximations (from linearization) at the computation ofASandQSin (37), which introduces a linearization error. The most straightforward approximation is to replace the secant with the tangent at the known solutionzh, i.e.(39)AS(z,zh;z∗,δz∗)≈AS(zh,zh;z∗,δz∗)=A′(zh;z∗,δz∗),(40)QS(z,zh;δz∗)≈QS(zh,zh;δz∗)=Q′(zh;δz∗).Henceforth, this approximation is used if nothing else is stated. Moreover, it is necessary to computez∗by suitable space–time discretization; see further below.As to the explicit structure of the dual problem (37), it is illuminating to elaborate on the expression forA′in (8). Upon integrating by parts in time on eachInand then rearranging terms, we obtain(41)A′(z;δz,δz∗)=∑n=1N{∫In[−(Φ′[z;δz∗],dtδz)+a′(z;δz,δz∗)]dt−(Φ′[z(tn−);δz∗(tn−)],〚δz〛(tn))}+(Φ′[z(tN−);δz∗(tN−)],δz(tN+))=defA∗(z;δz∗,δz).Upon introducing the form associated with eachIn(42)An∗(z;δz∗,δz)=∫In[−(Φ′[z;δz∗],dtδz)+a′(z;δz,δz∗)]dt+(Φ′[z(tn−);δz∗(tn−)],δz(tn−))we may expressA∗as(43)A∗(z;δz∗,δz)=∑n=1N[An∗(z;δz∗,δz)−(Φ′[z(tn−);δz∗(tn−)],δz(tn+))]+(Φ′[z(tN−);δz∗(tN−)],δz(tN+)).Moreover, we decompose the goal-functionalQinto(44)Q(z)=∑n=1NQn(z)+Q̄(z(T)),whereQnare space–time functionals on the open time-intervalsIn, andQ̄is a space-functional to be evaluated att=T. Hence, we obtain the forms associated with the dual loading as follows:(45)LN∗(z;δz∗)=Q̄′(z(tN−);δz∗(tN−))+QN′(z;δz∗)(46)Ln∗(z;δz∗,z∗(tn+))=(Φ′[z(tn−);δz∗(tn−)],z∗(tn+))+Qn′(z;δz∗),n<N.It is noted that (37) represents a time-dependent problem running backwards in time fromt=tN. Hence, we may consider the “incremental form” of (37) applied to the space–time slabsSnin sequence forn=N,N−1,…,1as follows: Findz∗|Sn∈C0(Sn)such that(47)AN∗(zh;δz∗,z∗)=LN∗(zh;δz∗),∀δz∗∈C0(SN),(48)An∗(zh;δz∗,z∗)=Ln∗(zh;δz∗,z∗(tn+)),∀δz∗∈C0(Sn),n<N,wherez∗(tn+)is known from the previous increment.RemarkLike in the case of the initial value for the primal problem, we may identify a fictitious “initial value”z∗(tN+)from the identity(49)(Φ′[z(tN−);δz∗(tN−)],z∗(tN+))=Q̄′(z(tN−);δz∗(tN−)),∀δz∗∈C0(SN)whereby (46) holds also forn=N. Henceforth, we tacitly use this identity independent on whetherz∗(tN+)actually exists or not; hence, the relation (48) is valid also forn=N.Let us consider a few important examples of goal functionalsQ̄where it is possible to directly identifyz∗(tN−):1.Q̄(z(T))=(Φ[z(T)],ψ), whereψ=ψ(X)is an extraction function onΩ0, then(50)Q̄′(z(tN−);δz∗(tN−))=(Φ′[z(tN−);δz∗(tN−)],ψ),∀δz∗∈C0(SN)and from (49) we conclude that the “initial condition” isz∗(tN+)=ψ.Q̄(z(T))=‖Φ[z(T)]‖, where‖•‖represents theL2norm onΩ0, then(51)Q̄′(z(tN−);δz∗(tN−))=1‖Φ[z(tN−)]‖(Φ′[z(tN−);δz∗(tN−)],Φ[z(tN−)]),∀δz∗∈C0(SN)and from (49) we conclude that the “initial condition” isz∗(tN+)=Φ[z(tN−)]/‖Φ[z(tN−)]‖, which depends on the primal solutionz.□Finally in this subsection, we give the more explicit expression for the error representation, given generally in (38), in the particular case that the dG(0)-method has been used for computing the FE-solutionzh. In this case we obtain from (26)(52)R(zh;z∗)=∑n=1NRn(zh;z∗),with(53)Rn(zh;z∗)=Δt[〈l(z∗)〉n−a(nzh;〈z∗〉n)]−(Φ[nzh]−Φ[n−1zh],z∗(tn−1+)).When a dG(k)-method is used for the time-integration of the dual problem (48) on incremental form, the FE-problem becomes: Findzh∗|Sn∈nVh0×Pk(In)such that, in sequence forn=N,N−1,…,1,(54)An∗(zh;δzh∗,zh∗)=Ln∗(zh;δzh∗,zh∗(tn+)),∀δzh∗∈nVh0×Pk(In).It is noted that this problem is linear inzh∗(due to the introduced linearizations).In the particular case that dG(0) is employed, we may rephrase (54) as a purely spatial problem for each time stepIn(as for the primal problem): Forn=N,N−1,…,1, findnzh∗∈nVh0such that(55)(Φ′[nzh,δzh∗],nzh∗)+Δta′(nzh;nzh∗,δzh∗)=(Φ′[nzh,δzh∗],n+1zh∗),∀δzh∗∈nVh0wheren+1zh∗is known from the previous time-step.77We make the tacit interpretation(Φ′[Nzh,δzh∗],N+1zh∗)=QT′(Nzh,δzh∗)∀δzh∗∈NVh0, whereby (55) is valid also forn=N.In this section, the novel strategy for sequential adaptive computations will be presented. A few important computational issues will be discussed subsequently. They can be categorized as:•Computation of an approximate dual solutionz∗. The main strategy is to introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the dual solution space, leading to additive decomposition of the dual solution into parts that represent space and time error, respectively. Note: An additive decomposition of the dual solution gives an additive decomposition of the computed error.Efficient strategy for adaptation of the space–time mesh on space–time slabsSnwithout the need for recursive adaptations of the whole time-mesh. The goal is to fully adaptively define the space-mesh and the time-step of eachSnin a truly sequential fashion fori=1,2,…,N, whereby it is noted that the number of time intervals,N, is a result of the adaptive procedure.RemarkIt is straightforward to incorporate the solution error, in addition to the usual FE-discretization error. The FE-error is the difference between the exact solutionzand the exact solution of the variationally consistent problem obtained from discretization, denotedzh. The solution error is, in principle, the difference betweenzhand the actual computational result, denotedzhSOLhenceforth. This error may have different sources (known or unknown). An example of such sources is incomplete iterations in a Newton iteration algorithm.□In order to be specific, although with minor loss of generality, we shall henceforth consider 2D-problems only. Moreover, we shall assume that the FE-spacenVhcontains standard piecewise linear approximation on triangular spatial meshes (as the simplest possible choice),88Here, we assume the approximation to be numerically stable, i.e., we assume that the Babushka–Brezzi inf-sup condition is satisfied if relevant.while the dG(0)-method is used in time.’As to the practical computation of the dual solutionz∗∈D0, we note that two principally different sources of error arise: (1) The dual problem (37) is linearized such that the secant formsAS(z,zh;z∗,δz∗)andQS(z,zh;δz∗), which depend on the exact (unknown) solutionz, are replaced by the tangent formsA′(zh;z∗,δz∗)andQ′(zh;δz∗)evaluated at the FE-solutionzh. (2) The exact solutionz∗∈D0is approximated with some suitablez̃∗∈D̃0, which is considered as an enhancement of the ordinary FE-solutionzh∗∈Dh0. Clearly,zh∗is completely ineffective as a direct approximation ofz∗, since it will not give any contribution to the error in view of the Galerkin orthogonality.We now consider an approximationz̃∗∈D̃0. In order to decompose the error estimate into spatial and temporal parts, we will consider the influence of the dual approximation on the residual.One possible strategy is to introduce a hierarchical enhancement upon introducing the decomposition(56)D̃0={z|Sn∈nD̃0}withnD̃0=nṼh0×P̃0(In)=Dh0⊕ΔD(s)h0⊕ΔD(t)h0⊕ΔD(st)h0such thatz̃∗can be decomposed additively as(57)z̃∗=z̃h∗+Δz(s)h∗+Δz(t)h∗+Δz(st)h∗withz̃h∗∈Dh0,Δz(s)h∗∈ΔD(s)h0,Δz(t)h∗∈ΔD(t)h0andΔz(st)h∗∈ΔD(st)h0. Hence, we have decomposedz̃∗into contributions from the regular FE-spaceDh0, a purely spatial enhancementΔz(s)h∗, a purely temporal enhancementΔz(t)h∗and a mixed spatial/temporal enhancementΔz(st)h∗.RemarkThe linear partz̃h∗∈Dh0is not identical to the regular FE-solutionzh∗∈Dh0, although bothz̃h∗andzh∗belong to the same spaceDh0(piecewise linear in space andP0(In)in time). However, they both qualify in the Galerkin orthogonality.□We may now obtain the approximate error representation as(58)R(zh;z̃∗)︸≃EFEM=R(zh;Δz(s)h∗+12Δz(st)h∗)︸≡E(s)FEM+R(zh;Δz(t)h∗+12Δz(st)h∗)︸≡E(t)FEMwhere we used the Galerkin orthogonality to drop the contribution fromz̃h∗, sinceR(zh;z̃h∗)=0.RemarkNote that we here tacitly choose to split the (higher order) mixed term and divide it between the spatial and temporal error contributions.□As to the enhancement in space, we simply choosenṼhas piecewise quadratics on each triangular element. The straightforward enhancement in time would be to setP̃0(In)=P1(In), corresponding to dG(1). However, in order to reduce the computational effort, we rather opt for a suitable smoothing procedure based on the dG(0)-solution and leading to piecewise linear variation in eachIn, while capturing possible discontinuities at each time nodetn. The space–time decomposition is shown schematically in Fig. 1for a single space–time element.We shall now describe a procedure for computing the components of the dual solution, given in (57), on each space–time slabSn.Firstly, we compute the enhanced solution in space by solving on the enhanced spatial discretization for dG(0) in time. Based on an end condition at timetn+, we thus computez̃∗,−∈Ṽh0such that(59)(Φ′[nzh,δz∗],z̃∗,−)+Δta′(nzh;z̃∗,−,δz∗)=(Φ′[nzh,δz∗],z̃∗(tn+)),∀δz∗∈Ṽh0whereṼh0is the space described by higher order elements (piecewise quadratics) thanVh0. Eq. (59) is thus the spatially enhanced version of Eq. (55).Using nodal interpolation onto the linear shape functions, defined byΠh, we compute the contributions as(60)z̃h∗=Πhz̃∗,−,Δz(s)h∗=(1−Πh)z̃∗,−.Secondly, we follow along the lines of Larsson et al.  [24] and compute the Discontinuous Smoothed dG(0) approximation as follows: A short backwards time-step approximationz̃∗,+∈Ṽh0is computed from(61)(Φ′[nzh,δz∗],z̃∗,+)+(1−β)Δta′(nzh;z̃∗,+,δz∗)=(Φ′[nzh,δz∗],z̃∗(tn+)),∀δz∗∈Ṽh0where, typically, we chooseβ=0.99. This step is to capture the discontinuity of the exact dual solution, cf. Fig. 2.Using linear interpolation in time, we finally identify the components(62)Δz(t)∗=t−tn−1βΔtΠh[z̃∗,+−z̃∗,−],Δz(st)∗=t−tn−1βΔt(1−Πh)[z̃∗,+−z̃∗,−].It is straightforward to account for the solution error that arises due to the fact that the computed solutionzhSOL≠zhin practice. It is then realized that, sincezhis never computed, it is necessary to replace the (approximate) dual problem (48) with the (even more approximate) problem(63)An∗(zhSOL;δz∗,z∗)=Ln∗(zhSOL;δz∗,z∗(tn+)),∀δz∗∈nD0,where, for the sake of simplicity,z∗denotes the exact solution to the approximate dual problem (63). Note that, althoughzhSOL∈Dh0, it does not necessarily satisfy the Galerkin orthogonality, i.e. in general we have(64)R(zhSOL;δzh)≠0for any givenδzh∈nD0. While it is still possible to make the hierarchical decomposition ofz̃∗, described above, the error representation now becomes(65)E(z,zhSOL)≃R(zhSOL;z̃∗),with(66)R(zhSOL;z̃∗)︸≃E=R(zhSOL;z̃h∗)︸≃ESOL+R(zhSOL;Δz(s)h∗+12Δz(st)h∗)︸≡E(s)FEM+R(zhSOL;Δz(t)h∗+12Δz(st)h∗)︸≡E(t)FEM.RemarkAs discussed above, it is possible to compute the hierarchical contributions approximately upon assuming thatz̃h∗≃zh∗. In such a case, we have(67)ESOL≃R(zhSOL;zh∗),whereas the different contributions toEFEMare still given formally as in (66).□A strategy for controlling independentlyE(s)FEMandE(t)FEM, as part of an adaptive procedure, is outlined in the next subsection.Our aim is to device an adaptive strategy in space–time that is computationally efficient. It is then highly desirable to avoid concurrent space–time remeshing ofS=Ω×I. We rather opt for an algorithm that allows for sequential adaptive space–time remeshing of eachSn=Ω×In, whereby the space-meshMh,nspaceandInare determined concurrently. In other words, eachSnis adaptively remeshed only once. Although this seems like a modest requirement, it is not trivial due to the fact that error transport fromSndepends on all other space–time slabsSn+1,Sn+2,…up to the last point in time for which we wish to control the error.As the first ingredient in the proposed strategy, we allow for99Note that this is merely a choice for distributing the error, and thus designing the discretization in space and time.the rate of error accumulation (including generation and transport) to be uniform in time, i.e. the stopping criterion is given, for any consideredSn, as follows:(68)En=defEn,SOL+En,FEM≤TOLΔtnTsubjected to the constraint condition(69)α−E(t)n,FEM≤E(s)n,FEM≤α+E(t)n,FEMwhereα+≥α−>0are “sufficiently close”. Clearly,α−=α+=0.5would correspond to equilibrated space–time error on eachSn.The second (and key) ingredient in the adaptive algorithm is that the dual solution computed on the initial space–time mesh plays a key role throughout the adaptive procedure, which is outlined as follows:1.For given initial (say uniform) space–time meshMH=defMh(0), compute the FE-solutionzH.Based onzH, compute the background dual FE-solutionzH∗onMHusing the basic FE-method, and carry out continuous smoothing in time to obtain the time-enhanced solutionz̃H∗. This dual solution is now stored.Forn=1,2,…, establish the space-meshMh,nspaceand the current time intervalInadaptively. This is done, for each adaptive iteration(k)according to the Box I, cf. also Fig. 3. After convergence of the adaptive procedure, then the set{Mh,n}n=1Nand the set{In}n=1Nhave been determined.RemarkIt should be noted that, due to the dG-formulation in time, initial conditions for the primal solution, as well as end-conditions for the dual solution, are naturally given by theL2-projection if the spatial mesh varies from one slab to another.□We consider the problem of consolidation of a poroelastic body (soil), whose mechanical state is determined by the displacement fieldu(X,t)and intrinsic pore pressure fieldp(X,t)forX∈Ω0andt∈I. Finite deformations are considered such thatΩ0represents the initial configuration att=t0=0. The boundaryΓ0ofΩ0is divided into Dirichlet and Neumann parts in two different ways;Γ0=Γ0,D(1)∪Γ0,N(1)=Γ0,D(2)∪Γ0,N(2). Firstly, the displacements are prescribed onΓ0,D(1), whereas surface tractions are prescribed onΓ0,N(1). Secondly, the (excess) pore pressure is prescribed onΓ0,D(2), whereas the drainage velocity is prescribed onΓ0,N(2). It is assumed that no volume loads act in the interior ofΩ0(for simplicity).The strong form of the consolidation problem can now be formulated in terms of the two balance equations1010Henceforth, we introduce the notation∇←for the differential operator acting in the left direction, e.g.P⋅∇←=∑j=13∂Pij∂XjEiin Cartesian coordinates with basis{Ej}i=13.:(70)−P⋅∇←X=0inΩ0×I,(71)dt(Jnρf)+∇X⋅(ρfW)=0inΩ0×I,whereby (70) represents the total quasistatic equilibrium (without acceleration) of the porous body, whereas (71) represents mass-conservation of the fluid occupying the pores of the porous body.In (70) we introduced the total 1st Piola–Kirchhoff stress,P, which can be split additionally into the solid (or effective) stress,Ps, and the fluid stress,Pf, measured per unit volume of the bulk (mixture). Moreover, the fluid stress is expressed in terms of the intrinsic pressure in the fluid,Pf=−pJnF−T, whereJ=det(F)withF=defI+u⊗∇←X=I+Hwith the displacement gradient defined asH=defu⊗∇←X, and wherenis the porosity.1111This is in accordance with the classical mixture theory. The difference to the Porous Media Theory (PMT), advocated by de Boer   [1], is the expression for the fluid stress, which isPf=−pJF−Tin the PMT.In (71), we introduced (in addition) the intrinsic density of the fluid,ρf, and the Piola–Darcy-seepage velocityW.Assuming intrinsic incompressibility of the solid particles, i.e.ρs=ρ0s=constant, it is possible to conclude from mass-conservation of the solid phase that(72)n=n(J)=1−J−1(1−n0)⇒Jn(J)=J−(1−n0)wheren0is the initial value of the porosity corresponding toJ0=1. This is an exact result under the given assumptions.RemarkA further simplification is obtained in the case it is assumed that the fluid is intrinsically incompressible as well, i.e.ρf=ρ0f=constant; then it is possible to cancelρffrom (71), which is rewritten as(73)dtJ+∇X⋅W=0inΩ0×Iwhere we made use of the relationdt(Jn(J))=dt(J−(1−n0))=dtJfrom (72).□What remains is to establish constitutive relations forPs(F)andW(F,G), whereG=def∇Xpplays the role of “seepage resistance”. In this prototype model we adopt the Neo-Hookean model for the solid skeleton and (a simplified version of) Darcy’s law for the seepage:(74)Ps(F)=2GJ−23[F−13I1(F)F−T]+KJ(J−1)F−T,(75)W(F,G)=−K⋅G,K=k[J−(1−n0)]C−1.withI1=tr(F⋅FT). We also assume intrinsic incompressibility of the solid particles (while the pore fluid can be compressible).The fluid stress is given as(76)Pf(F,p)=−p[J−(1−n0)]F−Tand the constitutive law for the pore fluid is chosen as(77)ϱf(p)=ϱ0f(1+pKf).We thus introduce the elastic constantsGandKfor the solid phase, the elastic constantKfand the permeability constantk. As to the dependency on the independent fieldsuandp, we note thatJ=J[u]is a nonlinear differential operator inu.In summary, we have(78)−Ps(F[u])⋅∇←X−Pf(F[u],p)⋅∇←X=0inΩ0×I,(79)dtΦ[u,p]+∇X⋅(ϱf(p)W(F[u],G[p]))=0inΩ0×I,where we introduced the “conservation” property (conservation of total fluid mass)(80)Φ[u,p]=def[J[u]−(1−n0)]ϱf(p).The boundary conditions are given as(81)u=uponΓ0,D(1)×I,(82)t=defP⋅N=tponΓ0,N(1)×I,(83)p=pponΓ0,D(2)×I,(84)q=defW⋅N=qponΓ0,N(2)×I,whereas the initial condition is chosen as(85)Φ[u0,p0]=n0ϱ0f=defϱˆ0f.For convenience, and without loss of generality, we may setu0(X)=defu(X,t0−)=0andp0(X)=defp(X,t0−)=0.Using the generic format in Section  2, we may establish the spatially weak form, given in (1), as follows(86)a(u)(u,p;δu)=l(u)(δu),(87)(dtΦ[u,p],δp)+a(p)(u,p;δp)=l(p)(δp),where we introduced the forms(88)a(u)(u,p;δu)=∫Ω0(δu⊗∇←X):P(F,p)dΩ0=∫Ω0(δu⊗∇←X):[Ps(F)+Pf(F,p)]dΩ0,(89)a(p)(u,p;δp)=∫Ω0(∇Xδp)⋅ϱf(p)W(F,G)dΩ0,(90)l(u)(δu)=∫Γ0,N(1)δu⋅tpdΓ0,(91)l(p)(δp)=−∫Γ0,N(2)δpqpdΓ0withF=F[u]andG=G[p].The formsAn(z;δz)andLn(z(tn−1−);δz), given generically in (13) and (15), respectively, can thus be expanded as(92)An(z;δz)=∫In[(dtΦ[z],δp)+a(u)(z;δu)+a(p)(z;δp)]dt+(Φ[z(tn−1+)],δp(tn−1+)),(93)Ln(z(tn−1−);δz)=∫In[l(u)(δu)+l(p)(δp)]dt+(Φ[z(tn−1−)],δp(tn−1+)),where we used the abbreviationz=(u,p). We may also derive the tangent formAn′(z;δz,δz∗)in the expanded form(94)An′(z;δz,δz∗)=(Φu′[z(tn−1+);δu∗(tn−1+)],δp(tn−1+))+(Φp′[z(tn−1+);δp∗(tn−1+)],δp(tn−1+))+∫In[(dt(Φu′[z;δu∗]),δp)+(dt(Φp′[z;δp∗]),δp)+(a(u))u′(z;δu,δu∗)+(a(u))p′(z;δu,δp∗)+(a(p))u′(z;δp,δu∗)+(a(p))p′(z;δp,δp∗)]dt,where we introduced the forms(95)(Φu′[z;δu∗],δp)=∫Ω0δpϱf(p)JF−T:(δu∗⊗∇←X)dΩ0,(96)(Φp′[z;δp∗],δp)=∫Ω0δp[J−(1−n0)]dϱf(p)dpδp∗dΩ0,(97)(a(u))u′(z;δu,δu∗)=∫Ω0(δu⊗∇←X):[Las(F)+Laf(F,p)]:(δu∗⊗∇←X)dΩ0,(98)(a(u))p′(z;δu,δp∗)=−∫Ω0(δu⊗∇←X):[J−(1−n0)]F−Tδp∗dΩ0,(99)(a(p))u′(z;δp,δu∗)=−∫Ω0(∇Xδp)⋅ϱf(p)Ya(F,G):(δu∗⊗∇←X)dΩ0,(100)(a(p))p′(z;δp,δp∗)=−∫Ω0(∇Xδp)⋅W(F,G)dϱf(p)dpδp∗dΩ0+∫Ω0(∇Xδp)⋅ϱf(p)Ka(F)⋅(∇Xδp∗)dΩ0,where the assumption on an incompressible solid skeleton in (72) and the relation for the fluid stress in (76) were used. The algorithmic 4th order stiffness tensorsLasandLaf, the 3rd order tensorYaand the 2nd order permeability tensorKaare given via the relations(101)(Ps)u′[•;δu]=(Ps)F′:δF=Las:(δu⊗∇←X),(102)(Pf)u′[•;δu]=(Pf)F′:δF=Laf:(δu⊗∇←X),(103)Wu′[•;δu]=WF′:δF=Ya:(δu⊗∇←X),(104)Wp′[•;δp]=WG′⋅δG=−Ka⋅(∇Xδp).For the specific choice of constitutive relations given in (74) and (75), i.e. the Neo-Hookean hyperelastic law for the solid skeleton and Darcy’s permeability law for the fluid seepage, we obtain(105)Las=GJ−23[I⊗¯I+F⊗¯F−1+29I1(F)F−T⊗F−T−23(F⊗F−T+F−T⊗F)]+KJ(2J−1)F−T⊗F−T−Ps⊗¯F−1,(106)Laf=−p{JF−T⊗F−T−[J−(1−n0)]F−T⊗¯F−1},(107)Ya=−kG⋅{JC−1⊗F−T−[J−(1−n0)][C−1⊗¯F−1+F−1⊗¯C−1]},(108)Ka=K=k[J−(1−n0)]C−1.Finally, for the chosen constitutive model of the fluid compressibility (77), we obtain the constant derivative(109)dϱf(p)dp=ϱ0fKf.Upon employing the dG(0)-method, we introduce the finite element spacesnVh=nUh×nPhassociated with the time intervalIn. The FE-problem thus reads: Forn=1,2,…,N, findnzh=(nuh,nph)∈nVhsuch that(110)Rn(u)(nzh;δuh)=Δt[〈l(u)(δuh)〉n−a(u)(nzh;δuh)]=0,∀δuh∈nUh0,(111)Rn(p)(nzh;δph)=Δt[〈l(p)(δph)〉n−a(p)(nzh;δph)]−(Φ[nzh]−Φ[n−1zh],δph)=0,∀δph∈nPh0,or(112)Δta(u)(nzh;δuh)=Δt〈l(u)(δuh)〉n,∀δuh∈nUh0,(113)(Φ[nzh],δph)+Δta(p)(nzh;δph)=(Φ[n−1zh],δph)+Δt〈l(p)(δph)〉n,∀δph∈nPh0.A Newton step then becomes: Finddzh=(duh,dph)∈nVh0such that(114)Δt(a(u))u′(nzh(l);δuh,duh)+Δt(a(u))p′(nzh(l);δuh,dph)=Rn(u)(nzh(l);δuh),∀δuh∈nUh0,(115)(Φu′[nzh(l);duh],δph)+(Φp′[nzh(l);dph],δph)+Δt(a(p))u′(nzh(l);δph,duh)+Δt(a(p))p′(nzh(l);δph,dph)=Rn(p)(nzh(l);δph),∀δph∈nPh0.We shall assume that the dG(0)-method is used to compute the primary solutionzh=(uh,ph)and that the appropriate dual solutionz∗=(u∗,p∗)has been found, wherebyu∗(X,t)is the dual displacement andp∗(X,t)is the dual excess pore pressure. We may then use the error representation in (48) and (49) directly to obtain(116)Rn(zh;z∗)=Δt[〈l(u)(u∗)〉n+〈l(p)(p∗)〉n−a(u)(nzh;〈u∗〉)−a(p)(nzh;〈p∗〉)]−(Φ[nzh]−Φ[n−1zh],p∗(tn−1+)).As to the explicit solution of the dual solution, it is given by (48), wherebyAn∗andLn∗can be expanded as(117)An∗(z;δz∗,z∗)=∫In[−(Φu′[z;δu∗],dtp∗)+(Φp′[z;δp∗],dtp∗)+(a(u))u′(z;u∗,δu∗)+(a(u))p′(z;u∗,δp∗)+(a(p))u′(z;p∗,δu∗)+(a(p))p′(z;p∗,δp∗)]dt+(Φu′[z(tn−);δu∗(tn−)],p∗(tn−))+(Φp′[z(tn−);δp∗(tn−)],p∗(tn−)),(118)LN∗(z;δz∗)=Q̄u′(z(tN−);δu∗(tN−))+Q̄p′(z(tN−);δp∗(tN−))+Qu,N′(z;δu∗)+Qp,N′(z;δp∗)(119)Ln∗(z;δz∗,z∗(tn+))=(Φu′[z(tn−);δu∗(tn−)],p∗(tn+))+(Φp′[z(tn−);δp∗(tn−)],p∗(tn+))+Qu,n′(z;δu∗)+Qp,n′(z;δp∗),n<NWe shall illustrate the sequential-adaptive strategy by computing the response of a partially saturated “sponge”,1212The notion of a sponge is adopted to illustrate the poro-mechanics behavior in large deformation elasticity. Note that for applications to, e.g., geo-mechanics problems, the modeling of the solid skeleton would preferably be that of elasto–(visco-)plasticity.adopting the poro-hyper-elastic formulation described in the previous section. We normalize the problem with respect to the shear stiffnessG, the permeability constantkand the lengtha. Doing so, we define the dimensionless variables representing the prescribed vertical load (traction) traction,T̄p, the elastic bulk modulus,K̄, the fluid compressibility,K̄f, the spatial position,X̄, and the time,t̄, as follows:(120)T̄p=def1GTp,(121)K̄=def1GK,K̄f=def1GKf,(122)X̄=def1aX,t̄=def2kGa2t.The dimensionless material data used in the computations areK̄=3/2, corresponding to Poisson’s ratioν=0for the linear response, andK̄f=103, corresponding to a nearly incompressible fluid.Fig. 4shows a 2D domain of size5a×5athat is studied under time-dependent loading in terms of a constant vertical traction distributed on the upper surface over the spatial length2a. The left and lower boundaries are subjected to symmetry boundary conditions, while the top and right boundaries are free. In particular, the point of interestP1atX1(located on the left boundary at a depth of0.5abelow the surface) is indicated in the Figure. The non-dimensional loading is applied in terms of a ramp-function in time(123)T̄P(t)={t̄t̄rT̄Pamp0<t̄<t̄rT̄Pampt̄r<t̄,wheret̄ris the duration of the ramp andT̄pampis the non-dimensional amplitude. Subsequently, we chooset̄r=0.01throughout.We shall now study the accuracy of the pressure at pointP1and timet̄=0.1. To this end, we conduct a simulation up until the time of interest, i.e. the non-dimensional end time isT̄=0.1, and we choose the goal quantity(124)Q(u,p)[=Q̄(u(T̄),p(T̄))]=p(X̄1,T̄).Following the arguments presented in, e.g., Larsson and Runesson [25], we choose to regularize this measure in space and time by introducing the slightly modified goal quantity(125)Q(u,p)=∫Ω×Iψ(X̄,t̄)p(X̄,t̄)dΩ×dt̄∫Ω×Iψ(X̄,t̄)dΩ×dt̄.The weight (or mollifier) function can be multiplicatively decomposed into spatial and temporal weights as follows:(126)ψ(X̄,t̄)=defψΩ(X̄)ψI(t̄),ψΩ={1‖X̄−X1̄‖≤rΩ0‖X̄−X1̄‖>rΩ,ψI={1t̄>T̄−rI0t̄<T̄−rI,where the radii of influence1313The radiirΩandrIrepresent the area in space and time, respectively, over which the pressure is evaluated in the mean sense.are chosen asrΩ=0.1andrI=0.001.RemarkThe construction ofQis chosen such that, when using the same quadrature for the two integrals, a constant is evaluated exactly, independent of the quadrature.□Fig. 5shows the convergence of the predicted error with increasing number of space–time degrees of freedom,NDOF, for uniform refinement in space and time. The corresponding effectivity of the error estimation is shown in Fig. 6in terms of the effectivity index,(127)η=defEpredictedEtrue,whereEpredicted=R(zhSOL;z̃∗)as presented in Eq. (66), and the true errorEtruecan be computed using an overkill solution for(u,p). Here, the dual solution is computed on the same mesh (using a hierarchically refined discretization) as that of the primal problem for each analysis. The results are shown for (nearly) linear response (withT̄pamp=0.001) as well as for strongly non-linear response (withT̄pamp=0.5).Next, we study the performance of the suggested time-sequential adaptive strategy. To this end, we consider the nonlinear case, defined byT̄pamp=0.5, and choose to study the long-time effect of consolidation in the problem by running the simulation for a longer time by settingT̄=1.0. We shall now consider two different goal functions, defined byi=1andi=2, as follows:(128)Qi(u,p)=∫Ω×Iψi(X̄,t̄)p(X̄,t̄)dΩ×dt̄∫Ω×Iψ(X̄,t̄)dΩ×dt̄,i=1,2where the weights are defined by(129)ψi(X̄,t̄)=defψΩ(X̄)ψI,i(t̄),ψΩ={1‖X̄−X̄1‖≤rΩ0‖X̄−X̄1‖>rΩ,ψI,i={1t̄>T̄−rI,i0t̄<T̄−rI,i,i=1,2.The spatial averaging radius isrΩ=0.1(like in the previous example), whereas the two different measures are distinguished byrI,1=0.001andrI,2=0.5, respectively, in the temporal domain. Hence, the difference lies in the temporal averaging, i.e.,Q1represents the pressure at the end timet̄=T̄=1.0in a regularized sense, while theQ2represents the mean pressure during the second half of the time interval. We compare the convergence of the predicted error for the time-sequential adaptive strategy to that of a uniform space–time refinement forQ1andQ2in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. In these examples, the background dual solution is that computed on the initial mesh.RemarkNDOFis the total number of degrees of freedom in space–time. The rate of convergence depends strongly on the “ratio” for refining in space versus time.□Next, we shall study the resulting space–time meshes for the adaptive strategy, aiming at equi-balanced error contributions from the spatial and temporal discretization and a total relative error that does not exceed the toleranceTOL=0.5%. The initial mesh is composed of 5 equal time steps andNDOFspace=138spatial degrees of freedom on each time-slab. In Figs. 9 and 10, the resulting time-mesh function, defined as the time-step lengthΔt̄as a function of time, is shown for the quantitiesQ1andQ2, respectively. Figs. 11 and 12show the resulting space-mesh function, defined asNDOFspaceversus time. Finally, Figs. 13 and 14show a series of snapshots of the spatial mesh att̄=0.1,0.5and 1.0 for the two different goal quantities.In this paper we have proposed a novel sequential-adaptive space–time finite element method for the coupled consolidation problem. This strategy is particularly suitable for linear goal functionals (such as the mean value of the pore pressure over a chosen finite time interval), in which case the dual loading is independent of the primal solution (and its approximation). In such cases it offers considerable advantages over the full-fledged concurrent adaptive strategy. Clearly, the present problem of poro-elasticity is too simple to provide an “acid test” for the significance of computing the dual solution accurately away from the end-time. The reason is that this problem has “parabolic character”, so that errors are strongly damped, cf. also below.As to future developments, the accuracy of the error prediction with respect to the choice of the background (initial) space–time mesh should be investigated. Our purpose is also to increase the physical realism by including material nonlinearities in the model, e.g. in terms of plasticity and viscoplasticity. Since it is sufficient to solve a suitably linearized dual problem, it is believed that the present approach will demonstrate its competitiveness when nonlinearities are incorporated. Moreover, dynamics (inertia terms) will be included, which are significant for road and railway mechanics problems subjected to traffic loading. For such problems it becomes obvious that it is necessary to solve the dual problem globally in time in an accurate fashion in order to appropriately account for the transport of error in space–time.We introduce the basis functionsnNi(X)innVh, such thatnzh=∑i=1MnnNi(nZ¯)i, withnZ¯=[nZ1,…,nZMn]Tas the vector ofMnunknowns in time stepn. In matrix notation, we may now rewrite (33) as that of findingdzh=∑i=1MnnNi(dZ¯)ifrom(A.1)nK¯(l)dZ¯=nr¯(l)withnK¯=defnB¯+ΔtnnA¯where the introduced matrices are defined as(A.2)(n+1,nB¯)ij=(Φ′[nzh,nNj],n+1Ni)=(n+1Ni,Φ′[nzh,nNj]),B¯=defn,nB¯(A.3)(nA¯)ij=a′(nzh;nNi,nNj)(A.4)(nr¯)i=R(nzh;nNi)=Δt(〈l(nNi)〉n−a(nzh;nNi))−(Φ[nzh]−Φ[n−1zh],nNi).Note that the generic coefficient matrix, introduced asK¯=defB¯+ΔtA¯, is generally non-symmetrical, in particular because of the non-symmetry that is normally embedded inB¯.Upon insertingnzh∗=∑i=1MnnNi(nZ¯∗)i∈nVh0into (55), we obtain(B.1)(nK¯)TnZ¯∗=(n+1,nB¯)Tn+1Z¯∗+nQ¯,n<Nwhere the matricesn+1,nB¯andnA¯where defined in (A.2) and (A.3), whereas(B.2)(nQ¯)i=Qn′(nzh;nNi).The adjoint character of (B.1) to the primary problem in (A.1) becomes apparent.RemarkIn the first step,n=N, we computeNZ¯∗from the equation(B.3)NK¯TNZ¯∗=NQ¯with(NQ¯)i=Q̄′(Nzh;NNi)+QN′(Nzh;NNi).As pointed out above, the “initial value”N+1Z¯∗may not even exist. However, if it does exist it can be computed from the relation(B.4)(N+1,NB¯)TN+1Z¯∗=NQ¯̄,with(NQ¯̄)i=Q̄′(Nzh;NNi).□We now introduce the basis functionsnNi(u)(X)innUhandnNi(p)(X)innPhsuch that(C.1)nuh=∑i=1Mn(u)nNi(u)(nU¯)i,nph=∑i=1Mn(p)nNi(p)(nP¯)i,are matrix representations, wherebynU¯andnP¯are column vectors ofMn(u)andMn(p)unknowns, respectively, in the time intervalIn. In matrix notation, we may now rewrite the system (114) and (115) as that of computingduh=∑i=1Mn(u)nNi(u)(dU¯)ianddph=∑i=1Mn(p)nNi(p)(dP¯)ifrom(C.2)[ΔtnS¯ΔtnC¯1nC¯3+ΔtnC¯2nM¯+ΔtnK¯][dU¯dP¯]=[nr¯(u)nr¯(p)],where the introduced matrices are defined via the component identities(C.3)(nS¯)ij=(a(u))u′(nzh;nNi(u),nNj(u))(C.4)(nC¯1)ij=(a(u))p′(nzh;nNi(u),nNj(p))(C.5)(nC¯2)ij=(a(p))u′(nzh;nNi(p),nNj(u))(C.6)(nK¯)ij=(a(p))p′(nzh;nNi(p),nNj(p))(C.7)(nC¯3)ij=(Φu′[nzh;nNj(u)],nNi(p))(C.8)(nM¯)ij=(Φp′[nzh;nNj(p)],nNi(p))(C.9)(nr¯(u))i=R(u)(nzh;nNi(u))(C.10)(nr¯(p))i=R(p)(nzh;nNi(p)).RemarkIn the special case of fluid incompressibility,ϱf=ϱ0f=constant, thenKf=∞and(Φp′[z;δp∗],δp)=0, i.e.M¯=0¯. Since all integrals involvingKfvanish, this means thatK¯becomes symmetrical (with the present choice of seepage model).The FE-solution ofz∗, denoted byzh∗, is obtained directly from the generic formulation in Section  2.4. For example, in the case the dG(0)-method is used, we may directly identify from (B.1), with(D.1)nuh∗=∑i=1Mn(u)nNi(u)(nU¯∗)i,nph=∑i=1Mn(p)nNi(p)(nP¯∗)i,that(nU¯∗,nP¯∗)must satisfy the system(D.2)[Δt(nS¯)T(nC¯3)T+Δt(nC¯2)TΔt(nC¯1)T(nM¯)T+Δt(nK¯)T][nU¯∗nP¯∗]=[(n+1,nC¯3)Tn+1P¯∗+ΔtnQ¯(u)(n+1,nM¯)Tn+1P¯∗+ΔtnQ¯(p)],wherenQ¯(u)andnQ¯pare column vectors defined by the identities(D.3)(nQ¯(u))i=Qu,n′(nzh;nNi(u)),(D.4)(nQ¯(p))i=Qp,n′(nzh;nNi(p)).In the first step,n=N, we obtain the problem(D.5)[Δt(NS¯)T(NC¯3)T+Δt(NC¯2)TΔt(NC¯1)T(NM¯)T+Δt(NK¯)T][NU¯∗NP¯∗]=[ΔtNQ¯(u)ΔtNQ¯(p)],where(D.6)(NQ¯(u))i=Q̄u′(Nzh;NNi(u))+Qu,N′(Nzh;NNi(u)),(D.7)(NQ¯(p))i=Q̄p′(Nzh;NNi(p))+Qp,N′(Nzh;NNi(p)).
