@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a new fuzzy peer assessment methodology that considers vagueness and imprecision of words used throughout the evaluation process in a cooperative learning environment is proposed. Instead of numerals, words are used in the evaluation process, in order to provide greater flexibility. The proposed methodology is a synthesis of perceptual computing (Per-C) and a fuzzy ranking algorithm. Per-C is adopted because it allows uncertainties of words to be considered in the evaluation process. Meanwhile, the fuzzy ranking algorithm is deployed to obtain appropriate performance indices that reflect a student's contribution in a group, and subsequently rank the student accordingly. A case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is described. Implications of the results are analyzed and discussed. The outcomes clearly demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy peer assessment methodology can be deployed as an effective evaluation tool for cooperative learning of students.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Cooperative learning is an educational approach or strategy in which students work in small groups to help each other to learn academic content [1]. The importance of cooperative learning in engineering disciplines has been explained and highlighted in [2–4]. Cooperative learning plays an important role to improve students’ soft skills, e.g., communication and teamwork, which is the essence in engineering studies [2]. While cooperative learning offers remarkable benefits (e.g., improving collaborative and critical thinking skills) to students at the tertiary level (i.e., the third stage of learning after graduating from the secondary school) [1], it is yet to be widely adopted owing to a number of practical challenges [5]. A search in the literature reveals that the assessment of an individual student in a group is not an easy task, since a group mark is often not a clear and fair reflection of each individual's effort [5–7]. Besides that, it is difficult for an instructor to closely monitor each student's efforts in a group; therefore it is not suitable for the instructor to assess each student's contribution [8,9]. To tackle these challenges, peer assessment has been introduced to evaluate each student's contribution in a group work [5–13]. Several successful case studies in peer assessment have been reported, e.g., in civil engineering [5], biological sciences [10], primary mathematics education [11], and computer studies [13]. In addition, substantial evidence to show that peer assessment can lead to improvements in quality and effectiveness learning is available [14].Generally, there are two types of peer assessment [10]: (i) involving students in a class to assess other students’ work; (ii) involving students to assess the contribution/performance of other students within the same group. These two types of peer assessment can be further classified into two; i.e., formative or summative assessment [15,16]. The goals of formative assessment are to monitor students’ learning capabilities, gather their ongoing feedbacks, and improve their learning experience [15,16]. On the other hand, summative assessment evaluates students’ learning capabilities at the end of an instructional unit [15,16]. Typically, an instructor needs to decide whether to use the formative or summative form of peer assessment [14]. This paper focuses on summative assessment, which focuses on the outcome of a learning process [9]. The procedure for summative assessment is further detailed in Section 2.4.Traditionally, the Likert scale (a numerical grading scale) is used in a way equivalent to psychological measurement [6,7,10,12]. As an example, a numerical grading scale (e.g., 1 to 5) can be used for assessment of group members [6,7,12], whereby “1” indicates “didn’t contribute”, “2” indicates “willing but not successful”, “3” indicates “average”, “4” indicates “above average”, and “5” indicates “outstanding” [6,7,12]. Even though the use of numerals in peer assessment is popular, it suffers from problems associated with psychological measurement in terms of the meaning pertaining to the numerals used (see [17] for a study on the theoretical relationship between measurement and marking). It would be more natural to define assessment grades using subjective and vague linguistic terms [17]. Furthermore, the conventional method aggregates individual scores to produce a total score. In some situations (as illustrated in Section 4.3), it is difficult to distinguish the ranking order of students using the same numeral score.Fuzzy set theory has been used in education assessment [9,18–23]. It is useful to deal with linguistic grades such as “didn’t contribute”, “willing but not successful”, and “average” in a grading system, which involve a substantial amount of fuzziness and vagueness [18]. It is worth mentioning that fuzzy set theory is an efficient and effective method to represent uncertainties [18,19]. Comparing with methods based on numerical grading scores [6,7,12], fuzzy set theory offers an alternative to linguistic evaluation in which “fuzzy” words, instead of numerals, are used during the assessment procedure [9,18–23]. Besides that, “computing with words”, as coined by Zadeh, is also a methodology related to fuzzy set theory, whereby the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language [24,25].Motivated by the success of fuzzy set theory in education assessment [9,18–23], this paper aims to propose a fuzzy peer assessment methodology that evaluates each student's contribution in a group work. The proposed methodology is a synthesis of perceptual computing (Per-C) [25–29] and a fuzzy ranking algorithm that uses fuzzy preference relations [30]. The rationale for the proposed methodology hinges on a number of imperatives. Firstly, the available information is too imprecise to be justified with numerals, which is more suitable to be represented using words [25]. In this paper, Per-C is adopted owing to its effectiveness in handling inherent uncertainties in words [25]. Specifically, Per-C is able to handle subjectivity, vagueness, imprecision, and uncertainty while achieving tractability and robustness in modelling human decision-making behaviours [25–29]. Comparing with type-1 fuzzy models [9,18–23], Per-C adopts interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) in tackling a decision making problem [25–29]. IT2FS has more flexibility in preserving and processing uncertainties than type-1 fuzzy set [25]. Indeed, Per-C has been successfully implemented to undertake a number of fuzzy multiple criteria hierarchical decision making problems [25–29]. In [25–29], Per-C focuses on ranking the sequence of outcomes, mapping the outcomes into words and/or classifying the outcomes into different categories. Nevertheless, the use of Per-C in peer assessment is still new. In this paper, the relative importance of the outcomes, i.e., the contribution of each student with respect to those from other students, is examined in detail, which is yet to be investigated in the literature, e.g. [25–29]. In this aspect, our preliminary work [30], as discussed in Section 2.3, is further extended to serve this purpose. Then, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed methodology are evaluated with a case study in an engineering course (i.e., Multiprocessors Architecture) at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. The results from the conventional and proposed methodologies are analyzed and discussed. In essence, this paper contributes to a new fuzzy peer assessment methodology in which human linguistic words are adopted in the entire assessment process. Besides that, the proposed methodology provides an insight pertaining to each individual's contribution; therefore providing personalized assessment in a cooperative learning environment.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the background of fuzzy sets, perceptual computing, fuzzy ranking algorithms and peer assessment in problem-based learning is presented. In Section 3, a new technique for fuzzy peer assessment is explained in detail. In Section 4, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed fuzzy peer assessment methodology. Concluding remarks and suggestions for future research are presented in Section 5.A number of notations and definitions related to type-1 fuzzy sets (T1FSs) and interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) are presented in Section 2.1. A review on perceptual computing is presented in Section 2.2. Our preliminary work related to a fuzzy ranking algorithm is reviewed in Section 2.3. Finally, an overview on peer assessment in problem-based learning is presented in Section 2.4.Consider a set of trapezoidal T1FSs, i.e., Aiwhere i=1,2,…,m, in the universe of discourse, U. A trapezoidal T1FS Aiis parameterized as Ai=(ai1,ai2,ai3,ai4,;Hi), as illustrated in Fig. 1.Definition 1[30,31]: A fuzzy membership function, μAi, of Ai, as shown in Fig. 1, is defined as follows:[30,32,33]: An IT2FSA˜iis denoted asA˜i=A˜i,A_i, andA˜iis parameterized in Eq. (4). The upper and lower membership functions ofA˜i(i.e.,μA¯iandμA_irespectively) are represented by type-1 membership functions.[32]: The fuzzy addition operation between two IT2FSs is defined as follows:[32]: The fuzzy multiplication operation between an IT2FS and crisp value k is defined as follows:The general structure of Per-C is depicted in Fig. 2. It consists of three components [25–29], i.e., an encoder, a computing-with-words (CWW) engine, and a decoder. Linguistic grades or words from humans are converted into IT2FSs through the encoder. The CWW engine aggregates the outputs from the encoder. The decoder maps the outputs of the CWW engine into a recommendation, which can be in the form of a word, rank, or class. However, the decoder ranks the outputs independently without considering their relative importance with respect to the recommendation. Nevertheless, it is imperative to rank each student's contribution and derive a set of performance indices that reflects the student's relative contribution in fuzzy peer assessment (i.e., peer assessment scores (PA)). While many fuzzy ranking algorithms are available in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, only a few solutions (e.g., [30] and [32]) are focused on the relative importance of two or more IT2FSs. The details are presented in Section 2.3.As discussed earlier, our focus is on investigating the relative importance of two or more IT2FSs. As such, the methods in [30] and [32] are considered. Specifically, our preliminary work [30], which is an extension of that in [32], forms the foundation of the proposed method. In [30], we studied the rationality, i.e., the fulfilment of the six reasonable ordering properties as stated in [25,34], and presented a number of improvements as compared with those in [32]. Assume that a set of IT2FSs,A˜i, where i=1,2,…,m. To better clarify the explanation, a simulated example with two IT2FSs (i.e.,A˜1= ((5.03,7.03,8.25,9.38;1),(6.03,7.75,7.93,8.82;0.75)) andA˜2= ((4.03,6.03,7.07,8.93;1),(5.03,6.57,6.60,8.00;0.75)), as illustrated in Fig. 3, is considered. The fuzzy ranking algorithm in [30] is summarized in five steps, as follows.Step 1Discretize the support ofA¯iandA_iofA˜iinto N points, i.e.,xA¯i,kandxA_i,k, k=1, 2, 3,…, N, and obtainμA¯i(xA¯i,k)andμA_i(xA_i,k), respectively.As an example, the discretized points ofA¯iare expressed in a sequence ofxA¯i,1,xA¯i,2,…,xA¯i,N, whereXA¯i,1andXA¯i,Nare the left and right-end points ofA¯i, respectively. The discretized points in the horizontal component ofA¯iandA_i, i.e.,xA¯i,kandxA_i,kare computed using Eqs. (7) and (8), respectively. On the other hand, the discretized points in the vertical component ofA¯iandA_i, i.e.,μA¯i(xA¯i)andμA_i(xA_i)are computed using Eq. (1). The discretized points ofA¯iare expressed in Eqs. (9) and (11) as well asA_iare expressed in Eqs. (10) and (12), as follows.(7)xA¯i,k=xA¯i,1+(k−1)xA¯i,N−xA¯i,1N−1.(8)xA_i,k=xA_i,1+(k−1)xA_i,N−xA_i,1N−1.(9)xA¯i=xA¯1,1⋯xA¯1,N⋮⋱⋮xA¯m,1⋯xA¯m,N.(10)xA_i=xA_1,1⋯xA_1,N⋮⋱⋮xA_m,1⋯xA_m,N.(11)μA¯i(xA¯i)=μA¯1(xA¯1,1)⋯μA¯1(xA¯1,N)⋮⋱⋮μA¯m(xA¯m,1)⋯μA¯m(xA¯m,N).(12)μA_i(xA_i)=μA_1(xA_1,1)⋯μA_1(xA_1,N)⋮⋱⋮μA_m(xA_m,1)⋯μA_m(xA_m,N).With the example in Fig. 3, the left- and right- end points ofA¯1(i.e., 5.03 and 9.38) andA¯2(i.e., 4.03 and 8.93) are discretized into N=1000 using Eq. (7). The left- and right- end points ofA_1andA_2are computed using Eq. (8). The discretized points forA¯1andA¯2as well asA_1andA_2are represented as matrices, i.e., Eqs. (9) and (11) as well as Eqs. (10) and (12), respectively.Step 2ComputeP(A¯i≥A¯j)andP(A_i≥A_j)using Eqs. (13) and (14), respectively. Note thatP(A¯i≥A¯j)andP(A_i≥A_j)are the ratios of the distance between two FSs of favourable outcomes to the total distance pertaining to two FSs of the entire possible outcomes.where,EjiU_=maxk=1,2…,N(xA_j,k)−mink=1,2…,N(xA_i,k)+1N∑k=1N(max(xA_j,k−xA_i,k,0)+max(μA_j(xA_j,k)−μA_i(xA_i,k),0))EjiL_=(xA_i,N−xA_i,1)+(xA_j,N−xA_j,1)+1N∑k=1N(xA_j,k−xA_i,k+μA_j(xA_j,k)−μA¯i(xA¯i,k))i,j=1,2,3,…,mStep 3Generate the fuzzy preference matrices as in Eqs. (15) and (16).Based on the aforementioned example, the fuzzy preference matrices forA¯1andA¯2(i.e.,P¯) and forA_1andA_2(i.e., P) are computed using Eq. (13) and Eq. (14) in Step 2, respectively. The simulation outcomes from Step 2 are compiled and written in Eqs. (15) and (16), as follows.P¯=0.50000.60980.39020.5000,P_=0.50000.70360.29640.5000Step 4Compute the ranking indices ofA¯iandA_iusing Eqs. (17) and (18), respectively.Again, based on the same example, using Eq. (17), the ranking indices forA¯1andA¯2are 0.5549 and 0.4451, respectively. Using Eq. (18), the ranking indices forA_1andA_2are 0.6018 and 0.3982, respectively.Step 5The ranking index ofA˜iis computed using Eq. (19).A higher ranking index ofA˜iindicates a higher ranking ofA˜i. With the same example, using Eq. (19), the ranking indices ofA˜1andA˜2are 0.5784 and 0.4216, respectively. Therefore,A˜1has a higher ranking thanA˜2.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, a new fuzzy peer assessment methodology is proposed. The proposed methodology is the synthesis of Per-C and a fuzzy ranking algorithm that uses fuzzy preference relations. Per-C is able to provide assessment pertaining to students’ contributions in term of recommendations in words. Meanwhile, the fuzzy ranking algorithm is able to provide indices that reflect students’ contributions in a group, and subsequently rank them accordingly. These indices are employed to derive students’ IWF scores. The group marks given by the instructor are then assigned to the students in the respective group based on their associated IWF scores. A real case study on an engineering course (i.e., Multiprocessors Architecture) has been conducted. The results from the conventional and proposed methodologies are compared, analyzed, and discussed in detail. The outcomes positively demonstrate that the proposed methodology is a potential solution to undertake fuzzy peer assessment tasks, which involve vagueness and uncertainty, in cooperative learning environments. In short, the proposed approach has shown to be a useful potential solution to several shortcomings related to the use of numerals in peer assessment, e.g., the meaning of numerals, the difficulty to distinguish the ranking order of students, and the difficulty in interpreting peer assessment outcomes.In this paper, a small population of students is used as a case study to demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach in peer assessment. As future works, the reliability of the proposed approach will be evaluated via a comprehensive study with larger size of population. Besides, consensus in group decision making [35,36] will be incorporated into the proposed methodology. The benefits include extending the proposed methodology from summative assessment to a hybrid framework of summative and formative assessments. Besides that, the proposed methodology will be deployed in other application domains such as risk assessment [37] and energy research [38].
