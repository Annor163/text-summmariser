@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study measures the performance of participating nations at the Olympics, considering the quest for medals as a two-stage Olympic process. The first stage is characterized as athlete preparation (AP) and the second stage as athlete competition (AC). We extend the relational model from the constant returns to scale framework to the variable returns to scale version. The efficiency of each participating nation in the entire two-stage Olympic process is calculated as a product of the efficiencies of both stages, and a heuristic search is applied to the extended relational model. The efficiency of each stage can be obtained and directions for improving the performance of participating nations in the two-stage Olympic process can be identified. An empirical study of the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games reveals that the efficiency of the AP stage is higher than that of the AC stage for the majority of participants. In addition, a plot of the relationship between these three efficiencies shows that the efficiency of the entire two-stage Olympic process is more significantly related to that of the AC stage than that of the AP stage.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The Olympic Games is one of the most popular and most important sporting and cultural events in the world. All participating nations strive to obtain many medals to enhance their international prestige and presence on the world stage. A nation's success at the Olympics can be judged by various measures including number of gold medals, total number of medals, and either of these scaled by some demographic such as population. The Olympic Committee has never published an official ranking of participating nations (Lins, Gomes, Soares de Mello, & Soares de Mello, 2003). Consequently, many researchers have analyzed the performance of participating nations in the Olympics.Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been widely used to evaluate the relative efficiencies of participating nations in the Olympics. DEA is a popular non-parametric technique for measuring the relative efficiencies of peer decision-making units (DMUs). This technique is popular in efficiency evaluation because it makes no assumptions on the production function and imposes no subjective weights on multiple inputs and outputs.Prior studies on DEA-based Olympics achievements evaluation can be classified into two categories. The first category is based on a constant input model in which the input for each nation is assumed to be a constant (Hai, 2007; Soares de Mello, Gomes, Meza, & Neto, 2008, 2009). These studies have goals similar to multicriteria-based researches (Saaty, 2008; Sitarz, 2012, 2013). The second category is based on classical DEA models in which inputs vary with nations and correspond to some social economic variables. For example, Lozano, Villa, Guerrero, and Cortés (2002) considered two inputs (GNP and population) and three outputs (total numbers of gold, silver, and bronze medals) to measure the performance of participating nations in five Summer Olympic Games (1984–2000). Lins et al. (2003) considered the limited number of medals to be won and proposed a zero-sum game DEA model to analyze the performance of participating nations. Churilov and Flitman (2006) linked self-organizing maps to a DEA model to rank participating nations. To increase the validity of evaluation results, both Lozano et al. (2002) and Lins et al. (2003) applied the same set of assurance region (AR) constraints to all nations. Li, Liang, Chen, and Morita (2008) assumed that different nations impose different AR constraints and applied context-dependent AR DEA to measuring the performance of participating nations. Zhang, Li, Meng, and Liu (2009) discussed underlying preferences in DEA and proposed DEA models with lexicographic preference to measure performance. Wu, Liang, and Yang (2009b) used a cross-efficiency DEA model to effectively rank participating nations and incorporated cluster analysis to effectively set frontier targets for inefficient DMUs. Considering competition among participating nations, Wu, Liang, and Chen (2009a) modified the game cross-efficiency model of Liang, Wu, Cook, and Zhu (2008b) to assess the performance of participating nations in the Summer Olympics. Because numbers of medals are always integers, Wu, Zhou, and Liang (2010) employed an integer-valued DEA model to measure the performance of each participating nation in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Soares de Mello, Angulo-Meza, and Lacerda (2012) proposed a non-radial DEA model to evaluate all participating nations in the 2008 Olympics, in which the input ``population of each nation'' is regarded as a nondiscretionary variable. Benicio, Bergiante, and Soares de Mello (2013) considered one input (the number of athletes) and three outputs (numbers of gold, silver, and bronze medals won) to measure the performance of nations in the 2010 Winter Olympics via an input-oriented, non-convex DEA model.All of these studies treated each participating nation in the Olympics as a black box. That is, these studies ignore internal processes. When the internal processes of the DMU are considered, the efficiency score of the DMU can be assessed accurately and insights into the performance of the DMU can be obtained (Färe & Grosskopf, 2000). The two-stage DEA, which is the most common network DEA, opens the black box and has been applied to many areas, such as army recruitment (Charnes et al., 1986), education (Lovell, Walters, & Wood, 1994), banking (Seiford & Zhu, 1999), physician care (Chilingerian & Sherman, 2004), information technology (Chen & Zhu, 2004; Wang, Gopal, & Zionts, 1997), mutual funds (Premachandra, Zhu, Watson, & Galagedera, 2012), insurance companies (Chen, Cook, Li, & Zhu, 2009; Kao & Hwang, 2008), and baseball (Sexton & Lewis, 2003). However, the two-stage DEA has not been used previously in research on the Olympic Games.In this study, we employ the two-stage DEA to measure the performance of participating nations for three reasons. First, the two-stage DEA can reveal the hidden inefficiencies of participating nations in the Olympics as compared to conventional DEA models (Moreno & Lozano, 2014). Therefore, few nations may have perfectly efficient performance in the entire two-stage Olympic process. Second, based on the two-stage DEA, we can obtain the efficiency for each stage and identify inefficient stages for each nation. Third, exploring the black box of participating nations in the Olympics can provide decision-making guidance to improve their performance.The two-stage Olympic process considered in this study is shown in Fig. 1. The first stage is characterized as the stage of athlete preparation (AP) which includes the cultivation, training and selection of participating athletes. The second stage is described as the stage of athlete competition (AC). In the AP stage, each nation uses two inputs (population and GDP per capita) to generate the one output (the number of participating athletes). Here, participating athletes are defined as the ones selected to participate in the Olympics. Regarding the choice of inputs in the AP stage, our model assumes that the greater the population a nation has, the more participating athletes can compete in the Olympics (Lins et al., 2003). It is better, however, to also consider the conditions for athletes' training and improvement of their capacities. There is no doubt that a wealthy nation can satisfy these conditions more easily. Our model assumes GDP per capita captures the most important element of the economic power of each participating nation. Thus, GDP per capita and population are two inputs of the AP stage. The output (the number of participating athletes) of the AP stage is referred to as the intermediate measure that links both stages as shown in Fig. 1. In the AC stage, the number of participating athletes is used as the input to produce three final outputs (the numbers of gold, silver, and bronze medals). The numbers of gold, silver, and bronze medals are selected as final outputs since Olympic achievement is measured with respect to medals won. Soares de Mello et al. (2012) and Benicio et al. (2013) used inputs and outputs similar to the AC stage of this paper.This study extends the relational model (Kao & Hwang, 2008) or the centralized model (Liang, Cook, & Zhu, 2008a11In fact, the two models are equivalent. For details, see Cook, Liang, and Zhu (2010).) to measure performance of the two-stage Olympic process and individual stages for each nation. This study assumes output orientation, because it makes no sense to cut down the population and GDP per capita for inefficient nations as would be done if we used input orientation for Olympic evaluation. Also, this study assumes variable returns to scale (VRS), because population, GDP per capita, and the number of participating athletes of all nations vary greatly. As the relational model is extended under the VRS framework, a product of free variables appears in the model. Thus, the extended relational model cannot be transformed into a linear programming problem. But we can apply a heuristic search (Li, Chen, Liang, & Xie, 2012) to calculating the global optimal solution for the extended relational model.The rest of this study is as follows. In Section 2, several models are developed to measure the efficiencies of each nation and its two individual stages. In Section 3, the proposed models are applied to the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games and obtained results are discussed. In the last section, concluding remarks are given.Suppose there are n participating nations and each participating nation is denoted as a DMU. Each DMUj( j = 1, 2, …n) uses two inputs Xij(i = 1, 2) to produce the intermediate measure Zdj(d = 1) in the AP stage. Then, the intermediate measure is treated as an input to generate the final outputs Yrj(r = 1, 2, 3) in the AC stage.When treating the DMU as a black-box, inputs of the DMU are GDP per capita and population, and outputs are the numbers of gold, silver, and bronze medals that DMUjwins. Thus the black-box efficiency of the participating nation DMU0 under evaluation can be obtained by applying BCC model (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984) as follows:(1)Minθ0=∑i=12viXi0+u0∑r=13urYr0s.t.∑i=12viXij+u0∑r=13urYrj≥1,∀ju1−u2≥ξu2−u3≥ξu1−2u2+u3≥ξvi,ur≥0,∀i,r,u0,free.where viand urare unknown non-negative weights attached to inputs and outputs, respectively. The three assurance regions (AR) u1 − u2 ≥ ξ, u2 − u3 ≥ ξ and u1 − 2u2 + u3 ≥ ξ indicate the relative importance among gold, silver, and bronze medals. For example, u1 − u2 ≥ ξ means that a gold medal is more important than a silver one, u2 − u3 ≥ ξ expresses the idea that a silver medal is more important than a bronze, and u1 − 2u2 + u3 ≥ ξ indicates that the difference in importance between a gold medal and a silver medal should be greater than the difference between a silver medal and a bronze medal (Soares de Mello, Angulo-Meza, & Da Silva, 2009). The non-Archimedean infinitesimal ξ is imposed to avoid the special condition that the three medals are equally valued (Soares de Mello et al., 2009). Denote the optimal objective function value of model (1) asθ0BCC*, which is the reciprocal of the black-box efficiency for DMU0. Thus, the black-box efficiency of DMU0 ise0BCC*=1/θ0BCC*.This study measures the performance of participating nations in a two-stage process. In prior two-stage DEA methods, two common methods are used for aggregating individual stages of a two-stage process: weight additive manner and multiplicative manner. The weight additive manner describes the efficiency of the entire two-stage process as a weighted average of efficiencies of individual stages. The weight attached to each stage reflects the relative importance of each stage. The multiplicative manner describes the efficiency of the entire two-stage process as a product of efficiencies of the two individual stages. In this study, we adopt the multiplicative manner because with this manner, if either of the individual stages has an efficiency score of zero, then the efficiency score of the entire two-stage process would be zero. That is, if a participating nation gains no medals in the AC stage, which means that the efficiency score of the AC stage is zero, then its Olympics achievement is zero regardless of its AP stage efficiency. If a nation does not participate in Olympics, then its AP stage efficiency would be zero and this case is not included in this study. Therefore, we combine the two stages in a multiplicative approach, namelyej=ej1*ej2. Moreover, output orientation is assumed in this paper, so we haveθj=θj1*θj2sinceej=1θj=ej1*ej2=1θj1*1θj2.We extend the output-oriented relational model of Kao and Hwang (2008) from the constant returns to scale (CRS) framework to the VRS version as follows:(2)Minθ0=θ01×θ02=∑i=12viXi0+u01η11Z10×η12Z10+u02∑r=13urYr0s.t.∑i=12viXij+u01η11Z1j≥1,∀jη12Z1j+u02∑r=13urYrj≥1,∀ju1−u2≥ξu2−u3≥ξu1−2u2+u3≥ξvi,η11,η12,ur≥0.∀i,ru01,u02,free.In model (2), the objective function expresses the efficiency of the entire two-stage Olympic process as a product of the two individual stages’ efficiencies. The first two sets of constraints ensure the efficiency scores of the two stages do not exceed one and the last three constraints are ARs for output weights. Also,η11andη12are unknown weights attached to the intermediate measure for the AP stage and the AC stage, respectively.Similar to Kao and Hwang (2008) and Liang et al. (2008a), this study assumes that the same weights are attached to the intermediate measure both for the AP and AC stages, i.e.η11=η12. For instance, the manufacturer and retailer jointly determine the price in their contract to achieve maximum profit (Huang & Li, 2001). Therefore, we also assume that the ‘‘worth’’ or value of the intermediate variable is the same regardless of whether they are being viewed as inputs or outputs (Li et al., 2012). Another reason is that this assumption can represent the series relationship between the two stages (Chen et al., 2009). If we solve the two-stage DEA without this assumption, then our method is identical to independently employing the BCC model for each stage. As pointed out in a number of studies (Chen & Zhu, 2004; Liang et al., 2008a), applying two separate DEA analyses to the two individual stages cannot represent the conflict between the two stages. In fact, when the AP stage is inefficient, its efficiency can be improved by expanding the intermediate measure Zdj, but such an action will deteriorate the AC stage efficiency since Zdjis the input of that stage. Hence, this paper assumesη11=η12=η1and model (2) can then be converted into the following model:(3)Minθ0=θ01×θ02=∑i=12viXi0+u01η1Z10×η1Z10+u02∑r=13urYr0s.t.∑i=12viXij+u01η1Z1j≥1,∀jη1Z1j+u02∑r=13urYrj≥1,∀ju1−u2≥ξu2−u3≥ξu1−2u2+u3≥ξvi,η1,ur≥0.∀i,ru01,u02,free.It is hard to transform model (3) into a linear model because it is a fractional programming problem and involves the product of free variables. To facilitate the linearization of this model, the heuristic search procedure of Li et al. (2012) is applied.Consequently, we consider the following model:(4)Minθ01=∑i=12viXi0+u01η1Z10s.t.∑i=12viXij+u01η1Z1j≥1,∀jη1Z1j+u02∑r=13urYrj≥1,∀ju1−u2≥ξu2−u3≥ξu1−2u2+u3≥ξu01=u02=0vi,η1,ur≥0,∀i,r.Model (4) measures the CCR efficiency of the AP stage sinceu01=u02=0. Denote the optimal objective function value of model (4) asθ01CCR*, then we haveθ01≤θ01CCR*since the feasible region of the model to measureθ01CCR*is smaller than that of the model to measureθ01and the objective function is to seek the minimum value. Thus, the reciprocal of the AP stage efficiency would be determined in an interval ofθ01∈[1,θ01CCR*].Model (4) is a fractional programming problem but it can be converted into a linear model via the Charnes–Cooper (C-C) transformation (Charnes & Cooper, 1962). Then model (4) is equivalent to the following linear programming model.(5)Minθ01=∑i=12wiXi0s.t.∑i=12wiXij−π1Z1j≥0,∀jπ1Z1j−∑r=13μrYrj≥0,∀jπ1Z10=1μ1−μ2≥ξμ2−μ3≥ξμ1−2μ2+μ3≥ξwi,π1,μr≥0,∀i,r.Sinceθ01∈[1,θ01CCR*],θ01can be considered as a variable in measuring the overall efficiency score of the two-stage Olympic process. Therefore, model (3) can be rewritten as:(6)Minθ0=θ01×θ02=θ01×η1Z10+u02∑r=13urYr0s.t.∑i=12viXij+u01η1Z1j≥1,∀jη1Z1j+u02∑r=13urYrj≥1,∀j∑i=12viXi0+u01η1Z10=θ01θ01∈[1,θ01CCR*]u1−u2≥ξu2−u3≥ξu1−2u2+u3≥ξvi,η1,ur≥0,∀i,ru01,u02,free.Model (6) can be converted into model (7) through the C-C transformation:(7)Minθ0=θ01×(π1Z10+μ02)s.t.∑i=12wiXij+μ01−π1Z1j≥0,∀jπ1Z1j+μ02−∑r=13μrYrj≥0,∀j∑i=12wiXi0+μ01−θ01×π1Z10=0∑r=13μrYr0=1θ01∈[1,θ01CCR*]μ1−μ2≥ξμ2−μ3≥ξμ1−2μ2+μ3≥ξwi,π1,μr≥0,∀i,rμ01,μ02,free.In order to calculate the optimal solution of model (7), we setθ01=θ01CCR*−k*ɛ. Here ɛ is a step size for the heuristic search procedure, and k = 0, 1, 2, ⋅⋅⋅, [kmax ] + 1 where [kmax ] is the maximum integer of(θ01CCR*−1)/ɛ. In solving model (7), we increase k from the initial value 0 to [kmax ] + 1. Thus for each k, a givenθ01(k)is obtained and then model (7) can be solved by linear programming. Denote the optimal objective function value of model (7) corresponding to each k asθ0v1(k)and the corresponding efficiency of the entire two-stage Olympic process ase0v1(k). Then, the global optimal solution of model (7) can be obtained asθ0v1*=Minkθ0v1(k). Thus, the corresponding global optimal efficiency score of the entire two-stage Olympic process ise0v1*=1/θ0v1*when the reciprocal of the AP stage efficiencyθ01is considered as a variable.When the two-stage Olympic process obtains its maximum efficiency ase0v1*, the maximum efficiency score of the AP stage ise01¯=1/θ01(k*)=1/(θ01CCR*−k*×ɛ), wherek*=Max{k|θ0v1*=θ0v1(k)}. As a result, the corresponding minimum efficiency score for the AC stage ise02̲=e0v1*/e01¯and we havee0v1*=e01̲×e02¯.Similarly, we can obtain the best possible CCR efficiency of the AC stage via the following model (8):(8)Minθ02=π1Z10s.t.∑i=12wiXij−π1Z1j≥0,∀jπ1Z1j−∑r=13μrYrj≥0,∀j∑r=13μrYro=1μ1−μ2≥ξμ2−μ3≥ξμ1−2μ2+μ3≥ξwi,π1,μr≥0,∀i,r.Denote the optimal objective function of model (8) asθ02CCR*. Then the reciprocal of the AC stage efficiency can be determined in an interval of[1,θ02CCR*], namelyθ02∈[1,θ02CCR*]. Thus model (3) can be rewritten as follows:(9)Minθ0=θ01×θ02=∑i=12viXi0+u01η1Z10×θ02s.t.∑i=12viXij+u01η1Z1j≥1,∀jη1Z1j+u02∑r=13urYrj≥1,∀jη1Z10+u02∑r=13urYro=θ02θ02∈[1,θ02CCR*]u1−u2≥ξu2−u3≥ξu1−2u2+u3≥ξvi,η1,ur≥0,∀i,ru01,u02,free.Sinceθ02is considered as a variable within the interval of[1,θ0max2], we can convert model (9) into a linear programming model as follows via the C-C transformation.(10)Minθ0=(∑i=12wiXi0+μ01)×θ02s.t.∑i=12wiXij+μ01−π1Z1j≥0,∀jπ1Z1j+μ02−∑r=13μrYrj≥0,∀jπ1Z10+μ02−θ02×∑r=13μrYr0=0π1Z10=1θ02∈[1,θ02CCR*]μ1−μ2≥ξμ2−μ3≥ξμ1−2μ2+μ3≥ξwi,π1,μr≥0,∀i,rμ01,μ02,free.Letθ02=θ02CCR*−tɛ, t = 0, 1, 2, …[tmax ] + 1, where [tmax ] is the maximum integer of(θ02CCR*−1)/ɛ. For each t, we can obtain a givenθ02(t), and then model (10) can be solved by linear programming. Denote the optimal objective function value of model (10) corresponding to each t asθ0v2(t)and the corresponding efficiency of the entire two-stage Olympic process ase0v2(t). Then, the global optimal solution of model (10) can be obtained asθ0v2*=Mintθ0v2(t). Therefore, the corresponding global optimal efficiency score of the entire two-stage Olympic process ise0v2*=1/θ0v2*when treating the reciprocal of the AC stage efficiency as a variable.The maximum efficiency score of the AC stage ise02¯=1/θ02(t*)=1/(θ02CCR*−t*ɛ), wheret*=Max{t|θ0v2*=θ0v2(t)}. Then the corresponding minimum efficiency score of the AP stage ise01̲=e0v2*/e02¯and we havee0v2*=e01̲×e02¯.To summarize, in the heuristic search procedure, when we consider the reciprocal of the AP stage efficiency as a variable, its maximum efficiency scoree01¯and the minimum efficiency score of the AC stagee02̲can be obtained. Similarly, if we treat the reciprocal of the AC stage efficiency as a variable, and then the maximum efficiency score of this stagee02¯and the minimum efficiency score of the AP stagee01̲can also be obtained.Theorem 1For each DMU,e0v1*=e0v2*, wheree0v1*ande0v2*are optimal efficiency scores of the two-stage Olympic process when the reciprocal of the AP stage efficiencyθ01and the reciprocal of the AC stage efficiencyθ02are considered as variables.See Appendix A.From Theorem 1, we havee0v1*=e0v2*and we definee0*as the unique efficiency score for the two-stage Olympic process. Thuse0v1*=e0v2*=e0*. Note that ife01̲=e01¯, thene02¯=e02̲becausee0v1*=e01¯×e02̲=e0*ande0v2*=e01̲×e02¯=e0*. In addition, ife01̲=e01¯ore02¯=e02̲, the efficiency decomposition for the two stages would be uniquely determined. Definee01*ande02*as the unique efficiency scores for the AP stage and the AC stage, respectively. □

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The performance evaluation of participating nations in the Olympics Games is a classical two-stage process. However, no previous study has used the two-stage DEA to measure the performance of participating nations in the Olympics. The current study evaluates such performance in a two-stage process. The individual stages are characterized as the AP (athlete preparation, including athlete cultivation, training, and selection) and AC (athlete competition) stages. Variable return to scale and output orientation are assumed. The weights of output multipliers are restricted to ensure the validity of the results. That is, a gold medal is more important than a silver medal and the latter is more important than a bronze medal, and the difference in importance between a gold medal and a silver medal should be greater than the difference between a silver medal and a bronze medal. A heuristic search is used to estimate the efficiency score of the entire two-stage Olympic process because of nonlinearity in the extended relational model. By applying the proposed models to the real data set of 85 participants in the 2012 London Summer Olympics, their efficiency scores for the entire two-stage Olympic process and the two stages can be obtained. The efficiency of the AP stage is usually higher than that of the AC stage. Moreover, the correlation between efficiencies of the entire two-stage Olympic process and the AC stage is more significant than that between the entire process and the AP stage.In this paper, the output multipliers of all participating nations have the same weight restrictions. However, different nations may value gold, silver, and bronze medals differently. Thus, how to impose different weight restrictions on output multipliers for different nations in the two-stage DEA model is a possible direction of future studies.
