@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Proposed here is an evaluation of multiple muscle loads and a procedure for determining optimum solutions to ergonomic design problems. The simultaneous muscle load evaluation is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and optimum solutions are obtained for each participant. In addition, one optimum solution for all participants, which is defined as the compromise solution, is also obtained. Moreover, the proposed method provides both objective and subjective information to support the decision making of designers. The proposed method was applied to the problem of designing the handrail position for the sit-to-stand movement. The height and distance of the handrails were the design variables, and surface electromyograms of four muscles were measured. The optimization results suggest that the proposed evaluation represents the impressions of participants more completely than an independent use of muscle loads. In addition, the compromise solution is determined, and the benefits of the proposed method are examined.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since the marketplaces of many products have reached maturity, decisions taken by consumers while they are purchasing products are affected by key factors such as product usability and design novelty in addition to rudimentary factors such as functionality, performance, and economy. Therefore, it is increasingly important for manufacturers to design products that provide comfort and satisfaction to consumers in addition to the rudimentary benefits (Jordan, 1998). Ergonomics or human factor methodologies are applied to product design in order to consider the satisfaction levels of consumers (Hägg, 2003). Bioinstrumentation measurements such as the electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electrocardiogram (ECG) are employed in ergonomic design to evaluate the usability of products quantitatively (Chaffin et al., 1999; Tsang and Vidulich, 2006). Among these, the surface EMG is frequently used for evaluating physical stress and fatigue because of the noninvasive nature and ease of its measurement (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1992). In general, surface EMGs of multiple muscles are measured when product usability and work fatigue are evaluated; however, often each surface EMG is evaluated independently.For example, Kothiyal and Kayis (2001) measured surface EMGs of the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, anterior deltoid, posterior deltoid, and middle deltoid when moving weights, so as to determine the effects of varying load magnitude and work rate on the muscular load in seated manual handling tasks performed with one hand. They concluded that each muscle load was dependent on the direction of movement and that it was difficult to identify the preferred movement direction for all muscles. Herring and Hallbeck (2007) measured the flexor digitorum profundus, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and posterior deltoid when pushing or pulling a shift lever, in order to determine the best location for the shift lever in a pushing and pulling task such as operating a manual transmission. From the results of measurements for pulling trials, a trade-off was found between the activity of the posterior deltoid and flexor digitorum profundus. These studies did not investigate a method for simultaneously evaluating multiple muscle loads.Eksioglu (2004) used the sum of multiple muscle loads as the indicator of comprehensive muscle load so as to determine the optimum grip span for a power grip exertion. However, it is possible that a particular muscle load dominates perceived total discomfort (hereafter referred to as the human satisfaction, or simply the satisfaction). In addition, the muscle load which dominates the satisfaction may be different for each consumer. Also, the weighted sum with different amplitude of weight may affect the satisfaction. Therefore, the sum of multiple muscle loads may not always represent human satisfaction with muscle loads; thus it might not be suitable in the comprehensive evaluation of muscle loads. Ben-Gal and Bukchin (2002) and Nussbaum et al. (2009) combined multiple objectives (i.e., economic measures and ergonomic measures) into one objective. However, in these studies, multiple objectives were combined arbitrarily. Objective functions have been applied to estimate muscle loads with biomechanical models because an excessive number of muscles exists in relation to the mechanical degrees of freedom at the joints (Alexander, 2003; Erdemir et al., 2007; Herzog, 1996; Prilutsky and Zatsiorsky, 2002). The two common criteria are minimization of the sum of squared muscle-force divided by maximum muscle-force (Pedotti et al., 1978) or minimization of the sum of cubed muscle-force divided by cross-sectional muscle-area (Crowninshield and Brand, 1981). These objective functions are defined for evaluating the strategy of a muscle activity, not for assessing the comfort of a human motion. Therefore, the objective functions already proposed for estimating muscle force are perhaps not appropriate for direct application to evaluating the burden that users feel.In previous studies (Chihara and Seo, 2011; Chihara et al., 2011), we proposed a simultaneous evaluation method for multiple muscle loads by applying the methodology of multi-objective optimization. Multiple muscle loads were defined as objective functions that should be minimized, and the simultaneous muscle load evaluation of each consumer was formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). That is, the MOOPs were formulated for each consumer. The each consumer's MOOP was solved and the optimum solution for each consumer was obtained. In general, optimum solutions for consumers do not correspond with each other; but we need to determine the only one design variable vector. We, therefore, introduced the concept of “regret” (Yu, 1973; Yu and Leitmann, 1974). The regret is defined as the difference from the optimum function value of the optimum solution. Hence, if design variable vector corresponds to the optimum solution, the regret equals to zero; and the more the distance from design variable vector to the optimum solution increases, the more the regret increases. Obviously the regrets of consumers do not always correspond to zero when the one design variable vector is determined for all consumers. Then, the design problem to determine one optimum solution for all consumers (hereafter referred to as the compromise solution) was formulated as the minimization of the maximum regret of consumers. The min–max problem indicates that the optimization of the problem makes objective function values for all consumers as close as possible to the objective function value of their each optimum solution.However, in previous studies, we considered only the muscle loads and did not confirm the degree of subjective satisfaction. That is, the relationship between the objective muscle loads and the subjective satisfaction levels was not clear. Thus, it is essential to develop the proposed method to evaluate the relationship between muscle loads and satisfaction levels. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to reveal the relationship between objective muscle load and subjective satisfaction levels. In this study, we derive an evaluation function of subjective satisfaction and evaluate the satisfaction levels of participants. The proposed method will provide designers both subjective and objective information for ergonomic design problem, and help the decision making of designers. Design of a handrail position for the sit-to-stand movement is undertaken as the case study and confirms the benefits of the proposed method.First, multiple objective indicators are measured while participants use a product or perform a task. Next, the response surfaces are predicted for objective indicators that are significantly changed by design variable changes. In addition, the consistency between objective indicators and subjective satisfaction levels is evaluated, and the response surface of satisfaction scores is predicted as the satisfaction level function. Then, the simultaneous evaluation of objective indicators for each participant is formulated as a MOOP, and the optimum design solution for each participant is obtained. Finally, a compromise solution for all participants is obtained by considering the regrets of participants. Moreover, the satisfaction level at the obtained compromise solution is also calculated to support the decision making of designers. The proposed method will be described in greater detail in the following subsections. In addition, the muscle load is taken as the example of the objective indicator in the following description, because muscle load (or, EMG) is used in the application.Design variables xi(i = 1, 2, …, nDES), which are unknown parameter to decide the design, are selected that possibly affect either the usability of an intended product or the work load of an intended task. It is noted that usability is defined as “the extent to which a product can be used by specific users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use” (ISO 9241-11, 1998). In other words, usability is the ease of use of a product; thus, physical effort is one of components that affect usability. Here, nDES represents the number of design variables. Then, multiple levels are set for each design variable. In addition, multiple muscles are selected that might contract while using the product or performing the task. The EMGs of the selected muscles are measured under all experimental conditions. Moreover, the subjective satisfaction scores for each condition are collected.Among the measured EMGs, those that exhibit significant changes in response to design variable changes are selected. Here, nEMG represents the number of selected EMGs. The response surfaces of the selected EMGs are approximated as follows:(1)Mˆj,k=fj,k(x)=fj,k(x1,x2,…,xnDES)(j=1,2,…,nEMG;k=1,2,…,nPAR)whereMˆj,kdenotes the approximate value of the j-th EMG of the k-th participant and nPAR denotes the number of participants. Moreover, fj,krepresents the response surface predicted by the radial basis function network (RBFN) (Orr, 1996). The RBFN performs well in terms of accuracy and robustness, irrespective of the degree of nonlinearity. Additionally, it is robust against experimental errors or noise (Jin et al., 2001). Thus, we consider the RBFN to be a dependable method for approximating the EMGs because the degree of nonlinearity in the EMGs is difficult to predict, and measured EMGs unavoidably contain experimental errors and noise. In this study, the parameters proposed for the RBFN by Kitayama and Yamazaki (2011) are adopted.The response surface of the subjective evaluation scores on the total muscle load is approximated as the satisfaction level function. However, it is possible that the subjective and objective evaluation conflict each other. That is, the trend of objective muscle load and that of subjective evaluation do not correspond with each other. There are two possibilities when the objective and subjective evaluation are in conflict. One is that the participants fail to properly assess their physical effort (i.e., muscle load in this paper); and the other case is that the participant's subjective evaluation is affected by unexpected physical effort. We can eliminate the participant if it is the former case; and also eliminate if the number of participants who have discrepancy is vanishingly low. However, we need to reselect the objective indicator (or EMGs) if most of participants are affected by unexpected physical effort. Therefore, the number of participants that have discrepancy between the objective and subjective evaluation may be regarded as the indicator for the adequacy of selected EMGs. Thus, the consistency of muscle loads and satisfaction scores are evaluated. First, the muscle loads dominance relation of experimental conditions is evaluated. Next, the consistency index described below is calculated on the basis of the muscle loads dominance relation and the subjective satisfaction scores. We assume that there is no discrepancy between the objective and subjective evaluation when the consistency index exceeds some critical value. When the number of participants who fail to properly assess their sensation is relatively low, they are eliminated. That is, the consistency index is calculated and participants who have discrepancy are eliminated, so as to enhance the reliability of measured data on the assumption that both the subjective and objective evaluations are correct when they correspond. The satisfaction level function is approximated for each selected participants.To judge the relationship of solutions in a MOOP, the concept of domination is used (Deb, 2001). The solution A is said to dominate the other solution B, if the solution A is no worse than solution B in all objectives and is strictly better than solution B in at least one objective. Let us consider a two-objective optimization problem with three different solutions shown in Fig. 1. Both objective functions need to be minimized. In Fig. 1, if solutions A and B are to be compared, it is found that solution A is better than solution B in both objective functions. Thus, solution A dominates solution B. In addition, if solutions A and C are to be compared, it is found that solution A is better than solution C in the first objective function; conversely, solution A is worse than solution C in the second objective function. Hence, solutions A and C do not dominate each other.In this study, the consistency between objective and subjective evaluation is determined with comparing the muscle loads dominance relation and the subjective satisfaction scores. Let us assume that the higher satisfaction score means better condition. Compared with solutions A and B in Fig. 1, there is no discrepancy between objective and subjective evaluation if the satisfaction score of solution A is larger than that of solution B. In addition, the objective and subjective evaluation conflict with each other if the satisfaction score of solution A is smaller than or equal to that of solution B. Compared with solutions A and C, it is difficult to determine the consistency whatever the order of the satisfaction scores of solutions A and C. This is because there is no dominance relation between solution A and C. The smaller the number of conditions that the muscle loads dominance relation and satisfaction scores conflict with each other, the objective and subjective evaluation are more consistent with each other. Therefore, the consistency index on k-th participant is defined as follows:(2)CIk=1−NkconfC2nEXPwhere CIkdenotes the consistency index for k-th participant, andNkconfis the number of discrepant conditions between the muscle loads dominance relation and the satisfaction scores. nEXP represent the number of experimental conditions; thusnEXPC2 is the total combination number of two conditions in nEXP conditions. CIkexists within the range from 0 to 1. CIkreaches 0 when the all combinations are in conflict, while CIkreaches 1 when no combinations are in conflict. We assume that there is negligible discrepancy between the objective and subjective evaluation when the consistency index exceeds some critical value. Then, the satisfaction level functions are approximated as follows:(3)Sˆk=vk(x1,x2,…,xnDES)whereSˆkdenotes the approximated value of the satisfaction level for k-th participant. vkrepresents response the surface of the satisfaction level function predicted by the RBFN. The critical value of consistency index should be determined in advance. However, there is no guideline to determine the critical value. Therefore, in this study, the critical value is determined by considering the relationship between the consistency index and the validity of the optimum solutions for participants.The simultaneous evaluation of muscle loads is formulated as a MOOP on the assumption that lower EMG values mean better comfort or usability for consumers. The simultaneous evaluation of muscle loads for the k-th participant is expressed in the following equations:(4){f1,k(x),f2,k(x),…,fnEMG,k(x)}→min(5)xiL≤xi≤xiU(I=1,2,…,nDES)(6)gl(x)≤0(l=1,2,…,nCON)where xiL and xiU represent the lower and upper bounds of the design variables, gk(x) is a constraint, and nCON denotes the number of constraints.In general, no single design variable vector exists that optimizes all objective functions simultaneously, so the objective functions are at least partly in conflict. Hence, the solution of the MOOP is a Pareto optimal set, which is a set of design variable vectors that cannot be improved upon for all objective functions simultaneously, that is, a Pareto optimal set consists of Pareto optimal solutions. In this paper, a satisficing trade-off method (STOM) (Nakayama and Sawaragi, 1984) is used to select a Pareto optimal solution that is suited to user satisfaction. Fig. 2shows a conceptual diagram of the STOM. Here, the point minimizing each of the objective functions is called the ideal point fI, and the objective function vector that is satisfactory or desirable to the decision maker is called the aspiration level fA. In addition, the ideal point can be provided by a decision maker. As shown in Fig. 2, the STOM obtains the Pareto optimal solution that is closest to the ideal point from the specified aspiration level. The Pareto optimal solution obtained by the STOM is hereafter referred to as the preferred solution. The aspiration level should be prescribed when solving the MOOP by means of the STOM. In this study, the objective function vector associated with the aspiration level is that of the optimum solution of the satisfaction level function of the participant. The preferred solution for the k-th participant is denoted byxi,k∗(i = 1, 2, …, nDES) and the preferred pointfj,k∗(j = 1, 2, …, nEMG) is defined as the objective function values of the preferred solution.If the preferred solutions for the participants correspond with each other, the preferred solutions may be taken as the compromise solution for all participants. Unfortunately, the preferred solutions for the participants usually do not entirely correspond with each other. In this study, the compromise solution determined for all participants is based on the concept of compromise (Yu, 1973; Yu and Leitmann, 1974). The regret defined in Section 1 is expressed asfj,k(x)−fj,k∗. Then, the design variable vector that minimizes the maximum regret among m participants is defined as the compromise solutionxc,mfor m participants. Here, the compromise solution is obtained by solving a min–max problem.The optimization problem for calculating the compromise solutionxc,mfor m participants is formulated as follows:(7)min[max1≤j≤nEMG1≤k≤m{fj,k(x)−fj,k∗}](8)xiL≤xi≤xiU(j=1,2,…,nDES)(9)gl(x)≤0(l=1,2,…,nCON)Eq. (7) is a problem that minimizes the maximum regret among the m participants. In other words, the min–max problem implies that the muscle loads of all participants are moved as close as possible to the preferred solution for each participant. It is difficult to solve Eq. (7) directly, so the following equivalent problem in terms of the auxiliary variable z is formulated in order to obtain the compromise solution:(10)z→min(11)fj,k(x)−fj,k∗≤z(j=1,2,…,nDES;k=1,2,…,nPAR)(12)xiL≤xi≤xiU(j=1,2,…,nDES)(13)gl(x)≤0(l=1,2,…,nCON)The maximum regret may decrease with the intended number of participants. Therefore, the relationship between the amplitude of the maximum regret and the number of divided subgroups of participants is presented to support the decision making of designers. The participants are divided into some groups by means of the cluster analysis (Miller and Miller, 2010) of their preferred solutions, and then the compromise solutions are obtained for each divided subgroup.The sit-to-stand (STS) movement is performed throughout the day at the rate of about 3 per hour (Dall and Kerr, 2010). Studies of the STS movement from a chair have been performed by many researchers (Alexander et al., 1991; Arborelius et al., 1992; Burdett et al., 1985; Janssen et al., 2002; Kerr et al., 1991; Rodosky et al., 1989; Schenkman et al., 1996; Su et al., 1998). Providing handrails is one recipe for making the STS movement easy. Several reports on the position of handrails for the STS movement can be found. These reports were mainly based on subjective evaluations by participants (Dekker et al., 2007) or the burden on the lower limbs only (Tanaka et al., 2009). However, the STS movement with handrails should ideally be evaluated on the basis of the comprehensive burden on both the upper and lower limbs. Therefore, the proposed method for simultaneous evaluation of muscle loads is applied to the STS movement, and we consider whether or not the proposed method can provide quantitative information on ergonomic design problems and support the decision making of designers.
