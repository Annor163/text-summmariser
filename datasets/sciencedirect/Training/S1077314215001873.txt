@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a novel method for separating reflection components in a single image based on the dichromatic reflection model. Our method is based on a modified version of sparse non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). It simultaneously performs the estimation of diffuse colors and the separation of reflection components through optimization. Our method does not use a spatial prior such as smoothness of colors on the object surface, which is in contrast with recent methods attempting to use such priors to improve separation accuracy. Experimental results show that as compared with these recent methods that use priors, our method is more accurate and robust. For example, it can better deal with difficult cases such as the case where a diffuse color is close to the illumination color.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
This paper considers the problem of separating reflection components (i.e., specular and diffuse reflections) in a single image. It is useful for several purposes. One is the use with photometric methods, such as shape-from-shading [1,2] and photometric stereo [3]. As these methods often assume the surfaces of objects to be perfectly diffuse, it is necessary to eliminate specular component before applying them to real objects having specular reflectance. The separation of reflection components is also useful for the visual recognition of materials of objects; the highlights extracted from images are used as features for the recognition.A large number of studies have been conducted to develop a method for accurately and robustly separating reflection components in a single image [4–13]. Most of them assume the dichromatic reflection model, which states that the light reflected on an object surface is given by a linear sum of a specular component and a diffuse component [4]. Specifically, the 3-vector ipcontaining the RGB values of a pixel p is given by(1)ip=αpis+βpid,where isis the color of the only illumination existing in the scene and idis the diffuse color (i.e., the color caused by diffuse reflection) of the object surface.If multiple pixels p share the same illumination color isand the same diffuse color id, then Eq. (1) gives constraints on the variables on the right hand side. This is the principle on which color-based methods for separating components in a single image rely. More specifically, they commonly consider the following setting:•The object surface consists of multiple regions with different diffuse colors, each of which consists of a number of pixels with a single color id.The illumination color isis known. The diffuse color idof each region and also which region each pixel belongs to are unknown. The coefficients αpand βpare different for each pixel p, both of which are also unknown.Early studies [7,8,14] attempt to solve the problem within this setting. More recent studies [9–13,15] attempt to utilize spatial information to improve separation accuracy. To do so, they incorporate spatial priors such as the smoothness of the diffuse colors and/or the specular reflections on the object surface.Our method separates reflection components based on sparse non-negative matrix factorization. It simultaneously performs the estimation of diffuse colors and the separation of reflection components through optimization. It is notable that our method does not use an additional prior or assumption as those used in the recent studies. In this respect, our study runs counter to the recent trend of research, which is also the argument we make in this paper. That is, the above setting with the dichromatic model (1) alone might be more sufficient than expected for accurate separation of reflection components. In fact, as shown in the experimental results, our method is more accurate and robust than the state-of-the-art that uses additional priors. As an additional prior is not necessary, our method is free from tuning a number of hyper parameters.
