@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this study, we have investigated the evidence of fetal heart rate asymmetry and how the fetal heart rate asymmetry changes before and after 35 weeks of gestation. Noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) signals from 45 pregnant women at the gestational age from16 to 41 weeks with normal single pregnancies were analysed. A nonlinear parameter called heart rate asymmetry (HRA) index that measures time asymmetry of RR interval time-series signal was used to understand the changes of HRA in early and late fetus groups. Results indicate that fetal HRA measured by Porta's Index (PI) consistently increases after 35 weeks gestation compared to foetus before 32 weeks of gestation. It might be due to significant changes of sympatho-vagal balance towards delivery with more sympathetic surge. On the other hand, Guzik's Index (GI) showed a mixed effect i.e., increases at lower lags and decreases at higher lags. Finally, fHRA could potentially help identify normal and the pathological autonomic nervous system development.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Evaluation of fetal status is important for reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality. Advancements of science and technology promises to elucidate information regarding developmental changes during antenatal period. Thus, fetal death remains a potentially preventable condition that has major personal, social and financial implications for both families and the broader community.Fetal well-being during pregnancy has been widely evaluated with fluctuations of fetal heart rate or fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) monitoring. This had started with introduction of cardiotocography (CTG—recording of fetal heart rate and force/pressure of contractions). However, initially it did not show any improvement over delivery outcomes [1] and became the main suspect for increased rate of cesarean sections [2]. After introducing the CTG interpretation guidelines in order to lower the number of neonates with asphyxia and cesarean sections [3,4], it remains the most prevalent method for fetal surveillance [5,6]. Besides poor standard of interpretation and high intra/inter observer variability [2], CTG delivers only the momentary heart rate with limited accuracy [7]. Therefore, CTG derived fetal heart rate time-series is not suitable for beat-to-beat analysis, which is clinically more significant than long-term measure [8,9]. Fetal magnetocardiogram (fMCG) overcomes these limitations of CTG and provides a non-invasive approach for monitoring fetal cardiac activity with sufficient precision [10,11]. However, fMCG requires magnetically shielded rooms (MSR), which limits the regular use of the device due to the high cost of MSR materials. Like fMCG, fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) is a non-invasive method for monitoring beat-beat fetal cardiac activity with sufficient precision. Although, extraction of fECG is difficult, we have reported blind source separation with reference signals (BSSR) technique for stable and reliable extraction of fECG [12–15]. Therefore, fECG is the simple and convenient method for non-invasive monitoring of fetal cardiac activity.The understanding of fetal neurological development in utero may lead to a better antenatal prediction of risk for adverse neurological outcomes, irrespective of intrapartum management. Since the fetal cardiac rhythm is controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the fHRV analysis is a simple way to understand the progressive development of ANS with gestational age (GA). At early GA, fetal heart rate is predominantly controlled by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and arterial chemoreceptors [16]. With GA parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) matures and fetal heart rate (fHR) reduces with increasing variability [17]. In the normal fetus, interplay between SNS and PNS (ANS activity) controls the fHR and results in a difference in the beat-to-beat intervals resulting in variability of fHR tracing. This control mechanism is exerted via the cerebral cortex, the medulla oblongata, the sympathetic ganglia and the vagus nerve. The completion of the 35 gestational week marks a developmental milestone because of its association with a dramatically decreasing risk for the neonate in the case of a preterm delivery. About 90% of babies born this week can survive and lungs are almost fully developed.Initial evaluation of fHRV was primarily based on the CTG assessment guidelines [3]. However, other methods derived from adult heart rate variability were used for fHRV analysis [18–21]. Since recent studies [22–25] have demonstrated that the recommendation standards for adult heart rate variability analysis [26] cannot be directly applied to fHRV studies, new linear and nonlinear parameters are started to be tested to analyze growth of fetus, classifying abnormal fHR and fetal status etc. [27–36]. Mostly used nonlinear methods are fractal dimension [18,19,27] and entropy based regularity measurements (approximate entropy and sample entropy) [20,28,29,31]. Recently we have used complex correlation measure (CCM), which measures the variability in the temporal structure of Poincaré, along with standard descriptors (SD1 and SD2) to investigate the changes in dynamics and variability of fHRV time-series with GA [37].Nonlinear methods of HRV analysis have become prominent, since they have improved predictive power for determination of sudden cardiac death risk and characterization of disease states associated with autonomic nervous system function [38]. Heart rate asymmetry (HRA) is a Poincaré plot based nonlinear parameter for assessing time irreversibility of heart rate or RR interval time-series signal. Asymmetry analysis can detect a more specific type of nonlinear dynamics [39] capable of producing temporal asymmetries of the heart rate and resulting in statistical properties that are different when the heart rate series are observed after time reversal. HRA is defined based on acceleration and deceleration of heart rate based on two consecutive heart rates or RR intervals [40,41]. In this definition, any point of Poincaré plot is classified as part of increasing or decreasing cloud with respect to line of identity (y=x). In our previous study, another definition was proposed for defining acceleration and deceleration clouds to quantify HRA based on two points of Poincaré plot [42]. Both definitions have been used with popular HRA indices namely Guzki's Index (GI), Porta's Index (PI) and Ehlers’ Index (EI). HRA analysis has been reported to analyse asymmetric properties of short and long-term HRV [40,42], altered parasympathetic nervous system activity [43], severity of apnea [44], blood pressure variability [45] and cardiovascular dynamics [46]. There is no study done to look at HRA in fetal heart rates.Therefore, the aim of this study was to check whether HRA is present in fetal heart rates and then how HRA changes over the gestational progression.Recording of the abdominal ECG signals from 78 pregnant women at the gestational age of 16–41 weeks with normal single pregnancies were collected from Tohoku University Hospital. To evaluate change of HRA with gestational age, we divided the fetuses into two groups G1 (∈ [20,32]) and G2 (∈ [35,41]). Since development of sympathetic nervous system completes by 35 weeks of gestation [15,47], which is also associated with a dramatically decreased risk for the neonate in the case of a preterm delivery, it was used to divide the fetuses into two groups. We kept a gap of 3 weeks of gestation age between two groups for reducing overlapping effect. Out of 28 fetuses 22 cases were after 35 weeks and 46 were before 32 weeks of gestational age. Summary demography of two groups are shown in Table 1.All recordings (each of 1min length) were sampled at 1000Hz with 16-bit resolution. The study protocol was approved by Tohoku University Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. fECG traces were extracted using a method that combines cancellation of the mother's ECG signal and the blind source separation with reference (BSSR) as described in our earlier study [15]. Intervals between successive R waves of the QRS complex (i.e., R–R intervals in seconds) were calculated using the algorithm developed by Pan and Tompkins [48]. Once RR intervals were calculated, the ectopic beat was selected automatically based on a predefined heart rate range. For any RR interval, if the instantaneous heart rate is lesser than 100beat/min or higher than 240beat/min then the interval was marked as ectopic and removed from the RR interval time-series. After artifact removal the average length of RR interval time-series for 68 recordings was 142beat.HRA is defined as the imbalanced distribution of points above and below the line of identity (Li) of the Poincaré plot (Fig. 1). Points above, below and on Lihave the property ΔRR>0, ΔRR<0 and ΔRR=0 respectively, where ΔRR=RRi+1−RRiand RRirepresents the ith RR interval.Guzik et al. have defined the index for measuring the asymmetry of the time series using a Poincaré plot [40]. GI is defined as the distance of the plotted points from the line of identity. Any point on the plot is given as Pi(RRi, RRi+1). The distance from line of identity is calculated as:(1)Di=RRi−RRi+122and GI is defined as:(2)GI=∑i=1C(Pi+)Di+2∑i=1N−1Di2×100wherePi+represents a point above the line of identity (RRi<RRi+1),Di+represents the corresponding distance ofPi+from the line of identity,C(Pi+)represents the total number of points above the line of identity and N is the total number of RR intervals.In contrast to the distance from the line of identity, PI is defined based on the distribution of points below and above the line of identity. PI is calculated as the percentage of the number of points below the line of identity with respect to the total number of points [41].(3)PI=C(Pi−)C(Pi+)+C(Pi−)×100wherePi−represents the point below the line of identity (RRi>RRi+1),C(Pi−)andC(Pi+)represent the total number of points below and above the line of identity, respectively.The following HRA indices were used to measure the asymmetry of the RR interval time-series:Poincaré plot is a time-delayed map of time-series signal, where the time delay termed as lag of the plot. Therefore, lag is an inherent property of Poincaré plot. The conventional method of quantifying HRA uses successive RR intervals with the implicit assumption that the current beat is influenced by the immediately preceding beat. However, the delay of such influence is affected by the variation of baroreflex sensitivity and therefore can be greater than one beat [49,50]. For example, the baroreflex sensitivity is reduced in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients [51], which augments the delay in the heart rate response. Therefore, a heartbeat influences not only the beat immediately following it, but also up to 6–10beat downstream [52] and several researchers confirmed that the lag is associated with disease processes [53,54]. Thus, successive RR interval duplets will likely underestimate the role of the autocovariance function of RR intervals i.e., the ability of heart beats to influence a train of succeeding beats. Moreover, the autocovariance function of RR intervals captures additional aspects of HRV (e.g. non-linearity) that are otherwise masked by the strong correlation between successive beats if lag 1 (n vs n+1beat) HRA is used. Therefore, we hypothesized that multi-lag HRA analysis will provide better understanding about the development of ANS in foetus with gestation.For multi-lag HRA analysis, we have introduced the lag (m) in Eqs. (2) and (3), used to calculate GI and PI from RR interval time series signal. In lag-m Poincaré plot the ith point on the plot is the dupletPim(RRi,RRi+m). Hence, in the multi-lag HRA analysis GI and PI indices were calculated using following equations:(4)GIm=∑i=1C(Pim+)(Dim+)2∑i=1N−1(Dim)2×100(5)PI=C(Pim−)C(Pim+)+C(Pim−)×100wherePim+andPim−represent the point above and below line of identity at lag m.C(Pim+)andC(Pim−)represent the number of points below and above line of identity at lag m.Dimrepresents the distance of pointPimfrom line of identity. In this study, we have used lag m=1 to 8 for analyzing HRA of fetal RR interval time-series signal.The non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test was performed to allow pair-wise testing for significant differences of HRA parameters between the two groups G1 and G2. Since, the number of subjects is small and their distribution is not normal, which was tested using Lilliefors test, a non-parametric test is more appropriate than parametric test.For each group, we estimated the dependence of the HRA indices on fetal maturation by calculating their correlation with GA. The Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient r was calculated to measure the strength of the association between HRA index and gestation age. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a nonparametric (distribution-free) rank statistic, which measures the monotone association that is used when the distribution of data makes Pearson's correlation coefficient undesirable or misleading. It assesses how well an arbitrary monotonic function can describe the relationship between two variables, without making any assumptions about the frequency distribution of the variables. Besides strength of the correlation it also provides significance of the correlation measured as p. In this study, p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
