@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This letter introduces an alternative approach to modeling the cardiovascular system with a short-term control mechanism published in Computers in Biology and Medicine, Vol. 47 (2014), pp. 104â€“112. We recommend using abstract components on a distinct physical level, separating the model into hydraulic components, subsystems of the cardiovascular system and individual subsystems of the control mechanism and scenario. We recommend utilizing an acausal modeling feature of Modelica language, which allows model variables to be expressed declaratively. Furthermore, the Modelica tool identifies which are the dependent and independent variables upon compilation. An example of our approach is introduced on several elementary components representing the hydraulic resistance to fluid flow and the elastic response of the vessel, among others.The introduced model implementation can be more reusable and understandable for the general scientific community.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Fernandez de Canete et al. [1] described a closed loop cardiovascular model and short-term and long-term mechanisms of arterial pressure control in the Modelica language and DYMOLA tool. The model is decomposed into several distinct components, which express computation of output volume, pressure and flow, based on elastance input, input flow and pressure. The basic blocks from standard Modelica libraries are composed together to model the whole hemodynamics with the control mechanism [1]. The process of computing of similar flowratevolume, pressure, elastance and resistance is repeated in multiple blocks of pulmonary circulation, systemic circulation and heart circulation [1].Redundant definition of similar relations and the mixing of more phenomenon in a single component were identified as antipatterns (bad practices) by Tiller [2], who recommends expressing single phenomenon as a general component model. This should be conducted by composing a subsystem model with instances of component models and utilizing the object-oriented features of the Modelica language.Additionally the model [1] defines the flow of the computation of output values from input values. It is identified as causal or signal-oriented modeling. Modelica allows the expression of models not only in the causal (signal) manner, but also in an acausal manner. The acausal modeling technique is based on the fact that model variables are expressed declaratively, and the Modelica tool identifies which are the dependent and independent variables upon compilation. We have shown that an acausal description captures the essence of the modeled reality much better, and the simulation models are much more legible and, thus, also less prone to mistakes [3]. With the greatest respect to the authors of the above-mentioned publication, we would like to introduce an alternative implementation of the original model with recommendations to reduce redundancy and utilize acausal and object-oriented modeling techniques. An example of our approach is shown with respect to an elastic vessel component with unstressed volume and external pressure.As a result of the acausal approach we believe that the alternative implementation method introduced can be more reusable by the scientific community for educational as well as for research purposes.Additionally, Modelica tools allow rich sets of numerical solving methods for further simulation and analysis, as well as export to third party tools used by computational physiologists.Supplementary materials contain a full source code of the alternative model implementation derived from the original publication in the Modelica language together with dependent libraries.
