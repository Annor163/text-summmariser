@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Even though they are weakly noticed, geometric part deviations accompany our everyday life. These geometric deviations affect the assemblability and functional compliance of products, since small part variations accumulate through large-scale assemblies and lead to malfunction as well as decreased product reliability and safety. However, the consideration of part deviations in the virtual modelling of mechanical assemblies is an ongoing challenge in computer-aided tolerancing research. This is because the resulting assembly configurations for variant parts are far more complicated than for nominal assemblies. In this contribution, two approaches for the relative positioning of point based models are highlighted and adapted to the assembly simulation of Skin Model Shapes, which are specific workpiece representatives considering geometric deviations. The first approach employs constrained registration techniques to determine the position of variant parts in an assembly considering multiple assembly steps simultaneously, whereas the second utilizes the difference surface to solve the positioning problem sequentially. The application of these approaches to computer-aided tolerancing is demonstrated, though their applicability reaches various fields of industrial geometry.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Geometric deviations are inevitably observed on every manufactured workpiece  [1] and affect the quality and function of mechanical products. In order to enable part interchangeability and manufacturing process independence in serial production though the presence of these deviations, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) has evolved as an important task in the design of physical artefacts  [2]. This task comprises i.a. the definition of nominal geometric part specifications as well as their allowable limits from a functional and manufacturing point of view with the aim to ensure assembly and functional requirements  [3,4].GD&T practice has led to the need for international standards, which are to offer a toolbox for the specification and non-ambiguous interpretation of tolerancing information throughout the product life-cycle  [5]. The lately revision of these standards (ISO17450-1:2011) offers a definition of a geometric specification as a condition on a characteristic, which is defined from geometric features   [6,7]. These features are created from the Skin Model, being a model of the physical interface between a part and its environment, by different operations, such as extraction or partition  [7,8]. The aim of this basic concept is to differentiate between the physical workpiece and its model in the abstract world  [8].However, the advent of solid modelling has led to the increased use of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), as well as computer-aided tolerancing (CAT) tools in digital product development, where the latter aim at supporting the GD&T activities mainly by simulating the effects of geometric part deviations on the product requirements without the need for physical prototypes  [8]. This requires the modelling and representation of geometric deviations and tolerances in such CAT tools, which is a key issue in computer-aided tolerancing research  [9,10]. Despite the vast research interest in this topic, most of the existing approaches, from 1D/2D tolerance stack-ups to assembly modelling approaches for variational geometry, imply severe assumptions, since they reduce geometric deviations to translational and rotational part feature defects, and therefore lack of form deviation considerations  [9–14]. This has tremendous effects on the digital feature, part, and assembly representation and leads to inadequate tolerancing decisions. Furthermore, most of these approaches are not conform to the standards for geometric product specification and verification (GPS)  [15], which endorses ambiguities and misinterpretations.In order to overcome these shortcomings of existing models for the computer-aided tolerance analysis, the concept of Skin Model Shapes has been developed, which are specific realizations of the Skin Model comprising geometric deviations brought in by manufacturing and assembly processes  [16,17]. In this regard, the concept of Skin Model Shapes is a finite model in contrast to the Skin Model, which requires an infinite description to allow the consideration of all different kinds of geometric deviations from a macro to a micro scale. Though the concept of Skin Model Shapes is not linked to a specific geometry representation scheme, a discrete geometry framework for the Skin Model Shape simulation has been developed, which employs discrete geometry representations, such as point clouds and surface meshes, and aims at generating these shapes in early as well as later design stages  [8,17–19]. These discrete geometry representations allow an integrated computer-aided GD&T process, since they are available throughout the product life-cycle from design, where they can be obtained from the CAD model by tessellation techniques, to manufacturing, inspection, and reverse engineering, where they are gathered from tactile or optical measurement systems  [20]. Furthermore, surface models comprising discrete geometry elements, such as triangles and points, enjoy increasing attention in the computer graphics and the CAD community  [21]. Fig. 1illustrates the Nominal Model, the Skin Model, and the different digital representations of physical artefacts for computer-aided tolerancing.The application of Skin Model Shapes to the computer-aided tolerance analysis requires models for simulating their relative positioning and assembly considering different kinds of geometric part deviations. In this context, the term “relative positioning” describes the positioning of a digital part representative relative to other part representatives in an assembly  [22]. The need for such models gives rise for this contribution, where the presented approaches have a strong geometric component and are therefore closely linked to the subject of Industrial Geometry   [23].
