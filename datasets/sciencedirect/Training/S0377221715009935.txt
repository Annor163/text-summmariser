@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The inventory routing problem (IRP) is a very challenging optimization task that couples two of the most important components of supply chain management, i.e., inventory control and transportation. Routes of vehicles are to be determined to repeatedly resupply multiple customers with constant demand rates from a single depot. We alter this basic IRP setting by two aspects: (i) only cyclic tours are allowed, i.e., each vehicle continuously tours its dedicated route, and (ii) all customers are located along a line. Both characteristics occur, for instance, in liner shipping (when feeder ships service inland ports along a stream) and in facility logistics (when tow trains deliver part bins to the stations of an assembly line). We formalize the resulting problem setting, identify NP-hard as well as polynomially solvable cases, and develop suited solution procedures.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Among the most basic trade-offs each supply chain faces is the one for the right delivery frequency when moving goods from stage to stage: Frequent deliveries allow lowering inventories, but come at the price of higher transportation costs and vice versa (e.g., Andersson, Hoff, Christiansen, Hasle, & Løkketangen, 2010). In this context, we treat the following special inventory routing problem (IRP):A set of customers each having an individual constant demand rate are to be supplied with a single commodity from a central depot. Customers may also send items back towards the depot, so that each customer also has a constant supply rate. These deliveries are executed by a homogeneous fleet of identical vehicles each having equal capacity and speed. Each vehicle is to be assigned a route, i.e., a sequence of customer visits, that is served according to a cyclic routing policy. A cyclic route means that a vehicle, once it has returned to the depot, is reloaded and instantaneously departs to repeat its identical route on and on. Vehicles are, thus, constantly in transit, so that transportation cost are less of an issue compared to the cost for the vehicle fleet that is applied to satisfy all customer demands in a timely manner. These costs are to be traded off against the inventory costs, which depend on how often each customer is visited. Another peculiarity we assume is that all customers are located along a line with the depot residing on one end. In this setting, we aim to determine cyclic routes, such that customer demands are satisfied without stock-outs and total costs are minimized.Note that our two alterations of the basic IRP allow us to identify both NP-hard as well as efficiently solvable problem versions, which is anything but self-evident for the “surprisingly complex” IRP (Bertazzi, Savelsbergh, & Speranza, 2008).Our special inventory routing problem has multiple potential applications, two of which are elaborated in greater detail in the following:11The pictures are published under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License. The author of map (a) is Huntster and picture (b) is from http://www.still.de/.Liner shipping with feeders: Inland shipping, which already makes up about 20 percent of all hinterland traffic in the European Union (with its share growing, (see Martinez de Oses & Castells, 2008)), is mostly managed by short-sea shipping companies in the form of liner shipping (Christiansen, Fagerholt, & Ronen, 2004). Thus, the feeder ships (vehicles) connecting smaller satellite ports (customers) to an international hub port (depot) are typically operated on fixed tours that are cyclically repeated, e.g., every week (see Christiansen, Fagerholt, Nygreen, & Ronen, 2013), similar to bus lines. The items that are transported are containers that are moved from the hub to the inland ports and vice versa. Once the cargo is in the care of a short-sea shipping company, these companies bear the responsibility for the inventory and will therefore endeavor to move the freight as quickly as possible. As “usually, ships are operated round the clock” (Andersson et al., 2010), the transportation costs need not explicitly be considered, but are rather driven by the fleet of feeders applied. Thus, we trade off the fleet size against the inventory costs of waiting containers. Another peculiarity of short-sea shipping is that satellite ports typically range along a coastline or stream, so that their geographic positions can be approximated by a line segment. A good example for this application is the container transport between Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port, and the plenty inland ports located along river Rhine as is depicted in Fig. 1(a).Part supply by tow trains: In the wake of the large product variety that is offered to today’s customers, many mass-producers, e.g., in the automotive industry, aim to supply their assembly lines with parts via frequent, small-lot deliveries. For this purpose, many of them install JIT-supermarkets, which are decentralized logistics areas directly on the shop-floor where parts are intermediately stored and sorted according to the needs of the assembly process. In such a supermarket (depot), parts are sorted into bins, loaded on tow trains (vehicles, see Fig. 1(b)), and delivered to the stations along the assembly line (customers). Here, part bins are put into racks and empty bins are collected and returned to the supermarket. This process is schematically depicted in Fig. 1(c); a more detailed description is provided in Battini, Boysen, and Emde (2013); Boysen, Emde, Hoeck, and Kauderer (2015). In line with the famous heijunka-principle of the Toyota production system, the major aim of many logistics managers is to have a steady and reliable part supply, so that the final assembly never runs out of parts. Thus, tow trains are typically operated along fixed routes that are cyclically frequented (see Emde & Boysen, 2012). This way, each station is visited in equidistant time intervals, which considerably facilitates part inventory control. The space in assembly stations is notoriously scarce, so that inventory stored next to the line is to be traded off against the delivery costs caused by the tow train fleet. Furthermore, assembly stations are typically located along a straight line, so that the two peculiarities of our special IRP are fulfilled in this application, as well.
