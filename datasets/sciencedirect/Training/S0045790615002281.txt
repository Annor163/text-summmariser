@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes an unambiguous correlation function applicable to generic sine-phased binary offset carrier (BOC) signal tracking. In the proposed scheme, first, we view the BOC sub-carrier pulse as a sum of multiple rectangular pulses. Then, we obtain partial correlation functions by correlating the multiple rectangular pulses with the received signal, and subsequently, construct two symmetric correlation functions by combining the partial correlation functions in a specialized way. Finally, we generate an unambiguous correlation function by combining the two symmetric correlation functions. The proposed correlation function has a sharper main-peak, and consequently, provides a better tracking performance than those of the conventional correlation functions in terms of the tracking error standard deviation (TESD).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) provide positioning and timing information for location-based services including navigation, tracking, and monitoring [1], and recently, new GNSSs such as European Galileo and the modernized global positioning system (GPS) have been developed to meet the demand for more precise location-based services [1,2]. The new GNSSs are designed to employ the BOC modulation providing a higher positioning accuracy than that of the phase shift keying (PSK) modulation used in the conventional GPS [3]. The BOC signal is generated by multiplying a pseudorandom noise (PRN) code with a sub-carrier of the sine-phased or cosine-phased square wave, then being denoted asBOCsin(kn,n)orBOCcos(kn,n), respectively: Here, k represents the ratio of the chip periodTcof the PRN code to the period of the sub-carrier, and n denotes the ratio ofTc-1to 1.023MHz [4,5].The main drawback of the BOC modulated signal is that its autocorrelation has side-peaks incurring an ambiguity in signal tracking, i.e., causing the tracking loop to lock on one of the side-peaks [6]. The GNSSs perform the positioning function based on the timing information, and thus, a timing offset due to a tracking error could result in a serious positioning error. To resolve the ambiguity problem, recently, several unambiguous correlation functions [6–11] have been proposed. Although they allow us an unambiguous signal tracking, all of them have some weak points: [6,9] are applicable only to theBOCsin(n,n)signal, [7,10] require auxiliary signals, increasing the hardware complexity, [8] cannot overcome the limit that the correlation function is widened as the value of k decreases, and [11] performs more poorly than even the ambiguous autocorrelation function in terms of the TESD performance.This paper proposes a novel unambiguous correlation function, which is applicable to the generic sine-phased BOC signal, i.e.,BOCsin(kn,n), does not require any auxiliary signal, and has a sharper main-peak (and consequently, a better tracking performance) than those of the conventional schemes. In the proposed scheme, we first model the BOC signal pulse as a sum of multiple rectangular pulses, and subsequently, correlate the multiple rectangular pulses with the received BOC signal, yielding partial correlations. Combining the partial correlations in a specialized way, then, we generate an unambiguous correlation function with a sharper main-peak than those of the conventional correlation functions.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe theBOCsin(n,n)signal model and its partial correlations. Section 3 proposes an unambiguous correlation function with a sharper main-peak than those of the conventional ones. In Section 4, tracking performances of the proposed and conventional unambiguous correlation functions are compared in terms of the standard deviation of tracking error. Finally, conclusion is drawn in Section 5.The baseband equivalent of theBOCsin(n,n)signal can be expressed as(1)b(t)=P∑i=-∞∞cipTc(t-iTc)d(t)csc(t),where P is the signal power,ci∈{-1,1}is the ith chip of a PRN code with a period ofT,Tcis the chip period of the PRN code,pα(t)is the unit rectangular pulse over[0,α),d(t)is the navigation data, andcsc(t)=∑m=01hmpTs(t-iTc-mTs)is the square wave sub-carrier withhm∈{-1,1}the sign of the mth sub-carrier pulse andTs=Tc/2the duration of a sub-carrier pulse. We view the sub-carrier pulse as a sum of2rrectangular pulses with a duration ofTp=Tc/(2r). Denoting the sign of the lth rectangular pulse asgl, we specify the set(gl,Tp)as((-1)2i+lr,12rn×1.023MHz), wherel=0,1,…,2r-1and⌊x⌋is the largest integer not larger than x. Then,b(t)can be re-written as∑l=02r-1bl(t)and can be depicted as shown in Fig. 1, wherebl(t)=P∑i=-∞∞ciglpTp(t-iTc-lTp)d(t), which is called the partial BOC signal.We assume that every chip of the PRN code is an independent random variable taking on +1 and −1 with equal probability and the code period T is sufficiently large compared with the chip periodTc. It is also assumed that the pilot channel, where no data modulation is present during the code tracking (i.e.,d(t)=1), is provided [12].Then, the normalized BOC autocorrelation can be expressed as(2)R(τ)=1PT∫0Tb(t)b(t+τ)dt=∑l=02r-11PT∫0Tb(t)bl(t+τ)dt=∑l=02r-112r∑m=02r-1glgmΛTp(τ+(l-m)Tp)=∑l=02r-1Cl(τ),where(3)ΛTp(τ)=1-|τ|Tp,|τ|⩽Tp,0,|τ|>Tpis a triangular function and(4)Cl(τ)=12r∑m=02r-1glgmΛTp(τ+(l-m)Tp)is called the lth partial correlation function and is depicted in Fig. 2.When there exist two symmetric correlation functionsRx(τ)andRy(τ)overlapping only around the main-peak, we can obtain an unambiguous correlation function with no side-peaks through the combination|Rx(τ)|+|Ry(τ)|-|Rx(τ)-Ry(τ)|based on the symmetry betweenRx(τ)andRy(τ). Moreover, we can obtain a sharper main-peak if the main-peaks ofRx(τ)andRy(τ)become narrower. These observations are the key motivation of the proposed scheme.To construct the symmetric correlation functions, we first combineC0(τ)withC1(τ),C2(τ),…,Cr-1(τ)as follows:(5)R1(τ)=∑i=1r-1C0(τ)★Ci(τ),wherex★y=|x|+|y|-|x-y|, and similarly, we combineC2r-1(τ)withCr(τ),Cr+1(τ),…,C2r-2(τ)as follows:(6)R2(τ)=∑i=r2r-2C2r-1(τ)★Ci(τ).From Fig. 2, we can see thatR1(τ)andR2(τ)are symmetric correlation functions that overlap only around the main-peak, and thus, we can obtain an unambiguous correlation function with no side-peaks as(7)R(τ)=R1(τ)★R2(τ)=∑i=1r-1C0(τ)★Ci(τ)★∑j=r2r-2C2r-1(τ)★Cj(τ),as shown in Fig. 2. From the figure, we can see that the proposed correlation function has a sharper main-peak than that of [8]. Specifically, whenr⩾2, the normalized height and half-width of the main-peak of the proposed correlation function are2(r-1)randTc2r, respectively, and they are the same as those of [8] whenr=1(i.e., [8] is a special case of the proposed scheme). The overall process for generating the proposed correlation function is depicted in Fig. 3, where we can see that the computational complexity of the proposed scheme highly depends on the value of r, i.e., the computational complexity is expected to increase as the value of r becomes larger. However, a larger value of r also provides a sharper main-peak (and consequently a better tracking performance) as seen in Fig. 2.Fig. 4shows the normalized correlation functions of the proposed and conventional schemes forBOCsin(n,n)whenr=1,2,3, and 4, where we can see that the proposed correlation function has a sharper main-peak than those of the conventional correlation functions whenr=3and 4.A delay lock loop (DLL) structure for the noncoherent BOC signal tracking is depicted in Fig. 5, whereΔandτrepresent the early-late spacing and phase difference between the received and locally generated BOC signals, respectively. As shown in the figure, the received signal is multiplied with the early and late versions of the local signal, and subsequently, the partial correlator and combiner perform the operations shown in Figs. 2 and 3, yielding the early and late versions of the proposed correlation function. Then, we obtain the discriminator output(8)D(τ)=R2τ+Δ2-R2τ-Δ2.The clock of the local signal generator is advanced or delayed by the numerically controlled oscillator, and finally, is locked whenτis 0. It should be noted that the improved performance of the proposed scheme comes from the fact that the discriminator output of the proposed correlation function has a much higher slope (i.e., a much higher discriminator gain) than that of the conventional correlation function as shown in Fig. 6.In this section, we extend the proposed scheme forBOCsin(kn,n)whenk>1. The baseband equivalent of theBOCsin(kn,n)signal can be expressed as(9)bk(t)=P∑i=-∞∞cipTc(t-iTc)d(t)csck(t),wherecsck(t)=∑m=02k-1hmkpTsk(t-iTc-mTsk)is the square wave sub-carrier withhmk∈{-1,1}andTsk=Tc/2k. Again, we view the sub-carrier pulse as a sum of2krectangular pulses with a duration ofTc/(2k), and thus,bk(t)can be re-written as∑l=02k-1blk(t)and can be depicted as shown in Fig. 7. Then, we obtain the partial correlations asClk(τ)=1PT∫0Tbk(t)blk(t)dt. By using (5)–(7), now, we construct the symmetric correlation functions as(10)R1k(τ)=∑i=1k-1C0k(τ)★Cik(τ)and(11)R2k(τ)=∑i=k2k-2C2k-1k(τ)★Cik(τ),and finally, we construct an unambiguous correlation function with no side-peaks as(12)Rexk(τ)=R1k(τ)★R2k(τ)forBOCsin(kn,n), which is depicted in Fig. 8.In this section, we compare the tracking performances of the proposed and conventional unambiguous correlation functions in terms of the TESD defined asσG2BLTIand the multipath error envelope (MEE), whereσis the simulated standard deviation of the discriminator output whenτ=0,G=dD(τ)dττ=0is the discriminator gain,BLis the loop bandwidth, andTIis the integration time [13]. It should be noted that the discriminator gain G can be re-written as(13)G=2TIPN0H2W4-2ΔW,whereP/N0is the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) withN0the noise power spectral density, and H and W are the height and width of a BOC correlation function, respectively. From (13), we can see that the discriminator gain becomes larger, as the value of H and W increases and decreases, respectively, when the value ofΔis small. This explains why the proposed correlation function can offer an improvement in tracking performance over the conventional correlation functions: The proposed correlation function is higher and narrower than the conventional correlation functions, and thus, has a larger discriminator gain than those of the conventional correlation functions, improving the tracking performance as we shall see in this section.For simulations, we assume the following parameters: Galileo E1-B PRN code with a period ofT=4ms,TI=T,Δ=Tc10andTc16,BL=1Hz,Tc-1=1.023MHz, and tunable parameters of [7,10,11] are optimized (i.e., the best performances of [7,10,11] are compared with other schemes including the proposed scheme).Fig. 9shows the discriminator gain G of the proposed and conventional correlation functions as a function of the CNR forBOCsin(n,n)whenΔ=Tc16. From the figure, it is observed that the discriminator gain of the proposed scheme is larger than those of the conventional schemes whenr=3and 4, and thus, we can anticipate that the proposed correlation function provides a better TESD performance than those of the conventional correlation functions.Fig. 10shows the TESD performance of the proposed and conventional schemes forBOCsin(n,n)as a function of the CNR, where the TESD of the BOC autocorrelation is also shown as a reference, and it should be noted that the scheme in [8] is a special case (i.e.,r=1) of the proposed scheme. From the figure, it is observed that the proposed scheme offers a better TESD performance than the conventional schemes whenr=3in the CNR range of 15–45dBHz of practical interest and the performance of the proposed scheme becomes better as the value of r increases. This is due to the fact that the main-peak becomes sharper as the value of r increases.Fig. 11shows the TESD performance of the proposed correlation function as a function of r forBOCsin(n,n)when CNR=20, 22.5, 25, 27.5, and 30dBHz, where the performance improvement is found to be saturated eventually forr⩾3. From the above observations and considering the complexity of the proposed scheme, we can conclude thatr=3is one of the reasonable choices for the proposed scheme.Fig. 12shows the MEE performances of the proposed and conventional schemes forBOCsin(n,n), where the amplitude ratio of the second path to the first path is set to 0.1 and 0.25. We obtain the MEE performance of the proposed scheme by averaging the MEE values whenr=2and 3, considering both the tracking performance and complexity. From the figure, we can see that the proposed correlation function offers a better MEE performance than [6–8,10], and the autocorrelation function for multipath delays less than0.5Tc.Fig. 13shows the TESD performance of the extended proposed scheme and conventional schemes forBOCsin(kn,n)as a function of the CNR whenk=2and 4. It should be noted that the schemes in [6,9] are not applicable toBOCsin(kn,n)signal whenk>1. From the figure, it is observed that the extended proposed scheme offers a better TESD performance than the conventional schemes in the CNR range of 15–45dBHz of practical interest. Fig. 14shows the MEE performances of the extended proposed scheme and conventional schemes forBOCsin(kn,n)whenk=2and 4, where the amplitude ratio of the second path to the first path is set to 0.1 and 0.25, and we can see that the proposed correlation function offers a similar MEE performance to those of the conventional correlation functions of [7,8,10], and the autocorrelation function.
