@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Permutation entropy is computationally efficient, robust to outliers, and effective to measure complexity of time series. We used this technique to quantify the complexity of continuous vital signs recorded from patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Using permutation entropy calculated from early vital signs (initial 10–20% of patient hospital stay time), we built classifiers to predict in-hospital mortality and mobility, measured by 3-month Extended Glasgow Outcome Score (GOSE). Sixty patients with severe TBI produced a skewed dataset that we evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The overall prediction accuracy achieved 91.67% for mortality, and 76.67% for 3-month GOSE in testing datasets, using the leave-one-out cross validation. We also applied Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis to compare classifiers built from different learning methods. Those results support the applicability of permutation entropy in analyzing the dynamic behavior of TBI vital signs for early prediction of mortality and long-term patient outcomes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of admission to emergency care and trauma-related death in the U.S. civilian population and is a major cause of death and disability in combat causalities [1,2]. In most modern intensive care units (ICUs), vital signs (VS), such as heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), among others, are collected in high-quality, automated, continuous electronic data streams, as sequential assessments of important physiological functions, providing basic evidence of patients’ status. Because VS are an early warning system of physiologic perturbation, they are usually recorded hourly in the ICU setting. However, in most modern ICUs, the massive quantities of high-quality data produced create both a challenge to store, analyze, and interpret and an opportunity to explore novel advanced analytic methods for predicting outcomes. Such predictive algorithms can support advanced instrumentation and decision-assist tools that have the potential to significantly improve clinical outcome for these very ill patients.To discover the intrinsic patterns that characterize continuous, multivariate, clinical time series, a variety of methods can be used, such as entropy, auto-correlation, autoregressive models, and structure models [3]. One strategy is to embed the time series into higher dimensional space and then compute various entropies for the elements of the embedded time series. Conventional entropies such as Shannon entropy, Rényi entropy and Tsallis entropy can be calculated given the distribution of elements of the embedded time series. The Rényi entropy of a time series has been used to detect spatially varying multivariate relationships [4] and to study brain injuries [5] and heart rate variability [6,7]. The Tsallis entropy of the elements of a time series has been used to monitor brain injuries after cardiac arrests [8], and to improve the accuracy of gene regulatory networks inference [9].Bandt and Pompe [10] introduced permutation entropy as a new measure of complexity of non-linear time series. Zanin et al. [11] provide an extensive review of various biomedical applications of permutation entropy. Permutation entropy has been used to predict the onset of epileptic episodes from EEG data by considering changes in the permutation entropy of the EEG time series over time [12,13]. Veisi et al. [14] find that permutation entropy can be used to effectively classify EEG signals into normal vs. epileptic with an accuracy of 85% even for highly noisy EEG. Physiologically, epileptic episodes/symptoms are manifested with deterministic behavior of the EEG signals, while healthy states are characterized by higher non-chaotic state variability [7]. Permutation entropy has also been used to study sleep using EEGs [15,16], to identify motifs in the EEG signals of patients given fast acting anesthetic drugs [17,18], and to identify temporal gene expression profiles [19]. Bian et al. [20] use permutation entropy to identify heart rate variability under different physiological conditions. Berg et al. [21] use ordinal patterns of beat-to-beat heart rate variability from an EKG signals of 40 patients who suffered from myocardial infraction, and try to classify them based on whether they survived for more than two years or not. They achieve a classification accuracy of 85%. Permutation entropy can also highlight forbidden patterns: state-space patterns/permutations appear very infrequently or not at all [22]. It can also be used to quantify non-linear interactions among time series by considering the relative entropy of the joint Takens embeddings of such time series versus the product of independent Takens embeddings [23].In this research effort, we use permutation entropy to derive features from continuous, multivariate, time series for outcome prediction of patients with severe TBI. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce the permutation entropy and the entropy map that we used for quantifying the characteristics of the dynamic system. We use different independence tests to assist in variable selection. In Section 3, we describe the dataset and experiment design. We apply the permutation entropy to predict mortality and 3-month Extended Glasgow Outcomes Scale (GOSE), and present experiment results, evaluated by accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We conduct preliminary interpretation of ordinal patterns derived from the VS. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss and summarize the results.
