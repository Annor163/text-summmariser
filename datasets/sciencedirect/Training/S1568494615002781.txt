@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aim of this paper is to develop a novel concept of uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft sets (ULFSSs), which applies the notion of uncertain fuzzy set to the soft theory. The relationships between two ULFSSs, including the inclusion relation, the equal relation and the complement relation, are studied based on the binary relations. We also introduce some basic set operations for ULFSSs, such as the ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ operations, the algebra operations. The properties of these operations are also discussed. As an application of this new fuzzy soft set, we propose a ULFSSs-based group decision making model, in which the weights of decision makers are obtained from a non-linear optimization model according to the ‘Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution’ (TOPSIS) method and the maximum entropy theory. Finally, an assessment of sound quality problem is investigated to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the approach mentioned in this paper.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Soft set theory, as a novel mathematical tool to handle vagueness and uncertainties, was introduced by Molodtsov [1] in 1999. Since the concept of soft set has been proposed, it was usually combined with other concepts, such as fuzzy set [2], interval-valued fuzzy set [3], intuitionistic fuzzy set [4] and type-2 fuzzy set [5]. The advantage of soft set is that it is free from the inadequacy of the parameterization tools, such as the probability theory, fuzzy sets and rough sets [1,4]. Recently, with these developments of soft set theory, kinds of applications have been studied, such as decision making [4–6,33–36], engineering [7], economics [8] and medical science [9], and so on. The meanings of kinds of soft sets are dealing with different practical issues based on vagueness and uncertainties.Noting that in many complicated cases, because of lack of professional knowledge or data, time pressure and the decision maker's (DM) limited expertise related to the issues, the decision makers can only give uncertain linguistic information [10–12], which is a direct extension of linguistic information proposed by Zadeh [13]. The linguistic information or uncertain linguistic information has been studied and applied to many fields, including information retrieval [14], risk analysis [15], especially in decision making [16–19].However, corresponding to the non-parametric mathematical tool, the situation that the approximate element of a soft set cannot be provided with objective evaluations has not been considered. The general framework of soft set is listed in Fig. 1.According to Fig. 1, up until now, types of soft sets have been developed, but the soft set theory can also be enriched and improved by combining other types of information. Correspondingly, the approximate elements can be applied to different real situations.In this paper, we will further extend a novel kind of soft set called uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set to deal with the situation, which combines the concepts of uncertain linguistic fuzzy set and the soft set. Therefore, together with the initial soft set [1], kinds of fuzzy soft sets [2–5,20] and rough soft set [39], we have generalized the soft set theories so that types of information can be utilized. Besides, from the angle of linguistic term set, the proposed uncertain linguistic fuzzy set also provides a novel computation model of linguistic term set, which is shown to be a useful tool in group decision making.To do this, the rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we briefly review some basic definitions and notations for further consideration. Section 3 introduces the concept of uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set (ULFSS) and studies the relationships between two ULFSSs based on binary relations. Besides, some set operations like ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ operations and algebra operations are also discussed in this section. We propose a new ULFSSs-based group decision making model in Section 4. An optimization model is developed to obtain the weighting vector of decision makers (DMs) based on ‘Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution’ (TOPSIS) approach and the maximum entropy theory. Finally, a case of assessment of sound quality problem is investigated in Section 5 to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach. Some conclusions and possible further works are shown in Section 6.Assume that U is a real and finite universal set and A is a subset of the parameter set EDefinition 2.1(see [1]). Let P(U) be the power set of U, a pair (F, A) is said to be a soft set over U, where F is a mapping given by F:A→P(U).It is worth noting that a soft set is not a set, but a parameterized family of subsets of U. For any e∈A, F(e) is considered as the set of e-approximate elements of (F, A).Definition 2.2(see [22]). A fuzzy set X over U is defined by a mapping μX, where(1)μX:U→[0,1],μXis said to be the membership function of X, the element μX(u) is the membership of u∈U. X can be also represented in the following:(2)X={(μX(u)/u):u∈U,μX(x)∈[0,1]}.The set of all fuzzy sets over U can be denoted by F(U).In Ref. [21], Maji et al. introduced the definition of fuzzy soft set by combining Definitions 2.1 and 2.2, which can be shown as follows:Definition 2.3(see [21]). Suppose thatP˜(U)is the fuzzy power set of U, a pair(F˜,A)is called a fuzzy soft set over U, whereF˜is a mapping given byF˜:A→P˜(U).According to Definition 2.3, the parameter sets are crisp in a fuzzy soft set, but the approximate functions are fuzzy subsets of U. Thus, the fuzzy soft set is more generalized than traditional soft set with crisp parameter sets and approximate functions. The following example will show the application of fuzzy soft set.Example 2.1The assessment of sound quality is of great importance for the judgment of sound, especially for musical works or sound equipments. Because of the blur of sound quality assessment, a multi-dimensional scaling method is usually applied to make an assessment according to the classification given by Linkwitz. lab. For instance, the clarity/articulation/speed, the spaciousness/openness, the instantaneous volume-range, the size of virtual sound image, the width/height of sound stage, etc.Assume thatU={v1,v2,…,v6}is a universal set and E={e1, e2, …, e5} is the factors that are considered by the classification given by Linkwitz. Lab. If A={e1, e3, e4, e5}⊆E andF˜A(e1)=0.6v1,0.3v2,0.9v3,0.5v4,0.8v5,0.3v6F˜A(e4)=0.3v1,0.9v2,0.6v3,0.9v4,0.3v5,0.8v6,F˜A(e5)=0.3v1,0.6v2,0.4v3,0.6v4,0.9v5,0.7v6.The tabular form of such fuzzy soft set is represented in Table 1.The linguistic approach is an approximate technique that represents qualitative contents by means of linguistic labels [13]. LetS={si, i=0, 1, …, g} be a set of linguistic labels, where sirepresents a possible value of a linguistic variable, g is an even number. The following characteristics are usually required:(1)The negation operator: Neg(si)=sg−i(g+1 is the cardinality);The order relation: si≥sjif i≥j;The maximization operator: max{si, sj}=siif si≥sj;The minimum operator: min{si, sj}=sjif si≥sj.When evaluating a book's efficiency to students, a set of nine linguistic labelsScan be listed as follows:S={s0=extremely poor (EP), s1=very poor (VP), s2=poor (P), s3=slightly poor (SP), s4=fair (F), s5=slightly good (SG), s6=good (G), s7=very good (VG), s8=extremely good (ED)}.Suppose thatS¯={sα|s0≤sα≤st,α∈[0,t]}is the extended continuous term set ofS, whose elements satisfy the characteristics mentioned above.Before introducing the concept of uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set, we first give the following definition of uncertain linguistic fuzzy set.Definition 2.4Let U be a real and finite universal set,S˜={s˜⊆[s0,sg]}is the set of all uncertain linguistic variables, where g is an even number. The following uncertain linguistic membership function(3)S˜(u):U→S˜.is called an uncertain linguistic fuzzy set defined on U.Note that the set of all uncertain linguistic fuzzy set over U can be denoted by ULFSs(U). The following concept of uncertain linguistic variable and corresponding operations are necessary for further consideration:Definition 2.5(see [10,23]). Lets˜=[sα,sβ]∈ULFSs(U), thens˜is said to be uncertain linguistic variable, wheresα,sβ∈S¯are the lower and upper limits ofs˜, respectively.Inspired by the operational laws of interval-valued fuzzy set, for anys˜=[sα,sβ],s˜1=[sα1,sβ1]ands˜2=[sα2,sβ2], the following operational laws of uncertain linguistic fuzzy set can be put forward.(1)(Inclusion relation)s˜1⊆s˜2if and only ifsα2≤sα1≤sβ1≤sβ2;(Complement)s˜C=[sg−β,sg−α];(Intersection)s˜1∩s˜2=[min{sα1,sα2},min{sβ1,sβ2}];(Union)s˜1∪s˜2=[max{sα1,sα2},max{sβ1,sβ2}].In order to solve the situation that the approximate functions are provided with subjective evaluations, we introduce the following notion of uncertain linguistic fuzzy set by combining the concepts of soft set and the uncertain linguistic fuzzy set.Definition 3.1LetP¯(U)be the set of all uncertain linguistic fuzzy subsets of U, a pair(F¯,A)is said to be an uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set (ULFSS) over U, whereF¯is a mapping defined by(4)F¯:A→P¯(U).An uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set is a mapping from parameters toP¯(U). For any e∈A,F¯(e)is a parameterized family of uncertain linguistic fuzzy subsets of U, i.e.,F¯(e)can be seen as the set of e-approximate elements of the uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set(F¯,A).The following concept is an equivalent definition of ULFSS:Definition 3.2Assume thatP¯(E)is the set of all uncertain linguistic fuzzy subsets of E, a pair(F¯¯,U)is also called an uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set (ULFSS), which is equivalent to the ULFSS over U.F¯¯is a mapping given by(5)F¯¯:U→P¯(E).From Definition 3.2, corresponding to ‘e-approximate element’ in(F¯,A), for any u∈U,F¯¯(u)represents the degree that u satisfies the parameters A⊆E, which can be called a u-approximate element.Different from the trapezoidal fuzzy soft set that captures the linguistic assessments [20], an uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set is the set of all uncertain linguistic fuzzy subsets of U.Example 3.1Following Examples 2.1 and 2.2, an evaluator provides his/her assessments of six voice samples with respect to the set of attributes A according to the extended continuous term setS¯={sα|s0≤sα≤s9,α∈[0,9]}.Then, an uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set can be provided,F¯A(e1)=[s7,s8]v1,[s5,s6]v2,[s5,s7]v3,[s4,s6]v4,[s7,s8]v5,[s6,s7]v6,F¯A(e3)=[s5,s6]v1,[s6,s7]v2,[s6,s8]v3,[s4,s6]v4,[s5,s7]v5,[s6,s8]v6,F¯A(e4)=[s4,s5]v1,[s7,s8]v2,[s6,s8]v3,[s6,s7]v4,[s5,s6]v5,[s6,s8]v6,F¯A(e5)=[s7,s8]v1,[s3,s5]v2,[s5,s6]v3,[s6,s8]v4,[s5,s6]v5,[s6,s7]v6,which is equivalent to the following:F¯¯U(v1)=[s7,s8]e1,[s5,s6]e3,[s4,s5]e4,[s7,s8]e5;F¯¯U(v2)=[s5,s6]e1,[s6,s7]e3,[s7,s8]e4,[s3,s5]e5;F¯¯U(v3)=[s5,s7]e1,[s6,s8]e3,[s6,s8]e4,[s5,s6]e5;F¯¯U(v4)=[s4,s6]e1,[s4,s6]e3,[s6,s7]e4,[s6,s8]e5;F¯¯U(v5)=[s7,s8]e1,[s5,s7]e3,[s5,s6]e4,[s5,s6]e5;F¯¯U(v6)=[s6,s7]e1,[s6,s8]e3,[s6,s8]e4,[s6,s7]e5.In the context, except in special cases, the definition of uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set is the concept defined in Definition 3.1.Motivated by the work of Babitha and Sunil [24] and Yang and Guo [25], we investigate the binary relation between two ULFSSs in this subsection.A binary relation is defined as follows:Definition 3.3(see [30]). A binary relation R defined on a set A is a collection of ordered pairs of elements ofA, such that R={xRy|(x, y)∈A×A}Some special binary relations R are:(P1) (Reflexive) xRx for all x∈A;(P2) (Irreflexive) For all x inAit holds that not xRx;(P3) (Symmetric) For any x, y∈A, if xRy, then yRx;(P4) (Antisymmetric) For any distinct x, y∈A, if xRy, then not yRx;(P5) (Asymmetric) For all x, y∈A, if xRy, then not yRx;(P6) (Transitive) For all x, y, z∈A, if xRy and yRz, then xRz.(P1) to (P6) are six possible properties of a binary relation, with these properties and Definition 3.3, hereinafter, we will develop some binary relations between two ULFSSs.Definition 3.4Suppose that A, B⊆E and(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)are ULFSSs over U, then(F¯,A)is called an uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft subset of(G¯,B)if and only if(1)A⊆B;For any e∈A,F¯(e)is an uncertain linguistic fuzzy subset ofG¯(e), i.e., for any u∈U,s˜F¯(e)(u)⊆s˜G¯(e)(u), which can be denoted by(F¯,A)⊂¯(G¯,B).In other words,(G¯,B)is said to be an uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft superset of(F¯,A), which can be denoted by(G¯,B)⊃¯(F¯,A).The relation⊂¯or⊃¯is a binary relation between two ULFSSs, which satisfies Reflexive, Antisymmetric, Transitive.According to Definition 3.4, the equivalence relation of uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft can be defined as follows:Definition 3.5Suppose that A, B⊆E and(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)are two ULFSSs over U, then(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)are called uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft equal if and only if(1)(F¯,A)is an uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft subset of(G¯,B);(G¯,B)is an uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft subset of(F¯,A).The relation ‘=’ is a binary relation between two ULFSSs, it satisfies the properties of Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive.The following concept of complement of uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set provides a relative angle to view the uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set.Definition 3.6Let A⊆E,(F¯,A)is an ULFSS. The complement of(F¯,A)is denoted by(F¯C,A), which is defined according to(6)F¯C:A→P¯(U),whereF¯C(e)=(F¯(e))C,∀e∈A.The complement relation is a binary relation between two ULFSSs, it has the properties of Irreflexive, Symmetric.Assume thatS˜={s˜⊆[s0,s10]},(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)are two given ULFSSs,U={v1,v2,…,v6}is the set of six voice samples, A={e1, e2}, B={ɛ1, ɛ2, ɛ3}, A⊆B andF¯(e1)=[s7,s9]v1,[s6,s8]v2,[s5,s6]v3,[s6,s8]v4,[s8,s9]v5,[s8,s10]v6;F¯(e2)=[s6,s7]v1,[s8,s10]v2,[s2,s4]v3,[s0,s1]v4,[s1,s3]v5,[s7,s8]v6;G¯(ε1)=[s8,s10]v1,[s6,s8]v2,[s7,s9]v3,[s6,s8]v4,[s8,s10]v5,[s8,s10]v6;G¯(ε2)=[s6,s7]v1,[s9,s10]v2,[s4,s5]v3,[s1,s3]v4,[s1,s3]v5,[s9,s10]v6;G¯(ε3)=[s3,s5]v1,[s8,s9]v2,[s5,s7]v3,[s7,s10]v4,[s9,s10]v5,[s2,s5]v6.It is easy to verify that(F¯,A)⊂¯(G¯,B).Besides, we can obtain the complement of(G¯,B)as follows:G¯C(ε1)=[s0,s2]v1,[s2,s4]v2,[s1,s3]v3,[s2,s4]v4,[s0,s2]v5,[s0,s2]v6G¯C(ε2)=[s3,s4]v1,[s0,s1]v2,[s5,s6]v3,[s7,s9]v4,[s7,s9]v5,[s0,s1]v6;G¯C(ε3)=[s5,s7]v1,[s1,s2]v2,[s3,s5]v3,[s0,s3]v4,[s0,s1]v5,[s5,s7]v6.The ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ operations are two basic set operations in soft set theory [4,6,20], correspondingly, we have the following ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ operations of uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft sets.Definition 3.7Let(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)be two ULFSSs over U, then the “AND” operation on(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)is defined by(7)(F¯,A)∧(G¯,B)=(H¯,A×B),whereH¯(ε,ς)=F¯(ε)∩G¯(ς),∀(ε,ς)∈A×B.Let(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)be two ULFSSs over U, then the “OR” operation on(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)is defined by(8)(F¯,A)∨(G¯,B)=(H¯,A×B),whereH¯(ε,ς)=F¯(ε)∪G¯(ς),∀(ε,ς)∈A×B.The ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ operations provide the approximate elements when considering the parameter in A×B.Example 3.3Following Example 3.2, we haveH¯(F¯(e1),G¯(ε1))=F¯(e1)∩G¯(ε1)=[s7,s9]v1,[s6,s8]v2,[s5,s6]v3,[s6,s8]v4,[s8,s9]v5,[s8,s10]v6;H¯(F¯(e1),G¯(ε1))=F¯(e1)∪G¯(ε1)=[s8,s10]v1,[s6,s8]v2,[s7,s9]v3,[s6,s8]v4,[s8,s10]v5,[s8,s10]v6The results of ‘AND’ operations on(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)are listed in Table 2.Similarly, the results of ‘OR’ operations on(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)are listed in Table 3.According to the concepts of ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ operations, the following properties of the two operations hold:Theorem 3.1Given that(F¯,A)and(G¯,B)are two ULFSSs, we have(1)((F¯,A)∧(G¯,B))C=(F¯,A)C∨(G¯,B)C;((F¯,A)∨(G¯,B))C=(F¯,A)C∧(G¯,B)C.(1) According to Definition 3.7, assume thatF¯(ε)={s˜F¯(ε)=[sα(u),sβ(u)]|u∈U}andG¯(ς)={s˜G¯(ς)=[sα′(u),sβ′(u)]|u∈U}for any (ɛ, ς)∈A×B, we have(9)((F¯,A)∧(G¯,B))C=(F¯(ε)∩G¯(ς))C=([min{sα(u),sα′(u)},min{sβ(u),sβ′(u)}])C=[sα″(u),sβ″(u)]C=[sg−α″(u),sg−β″(u)].wheresα″(u)=min{sα(u),sα′(u)},sβ″(u)=min{sβ(u),sβ′(u)}.It is easy to obtain thatsg−α″(u)=max{sg−α(u),sg−α′(u)},sg−β″(u)=max{sg−β(u),sg−β′(u)},and(10)(F¯,A)C∨(G¯,B)C=[sg−α(u),sg−β(u)]∨[sg−α′(u),sg−β′(u)]=[max{sg−α(u),sg−α′(u)},max{sg−β(u),sg−β′(u)}]=[sg−α″(u),sg−β″(u)]Thus, with Eqs. (7)–(10), we have((F¯,A)∧(G¯,B))C=(F¯,A)C∨(G¯,B)C.Similarly, we can get((F¯,A)∨(G¯,B))C=(F¯,A)C∧(G¯,B)C, which proves Theorem 3.1.Suppose that(F¯,A),(G¯,B)and(H¯,C)are three ULFSSs, then(1) (Associative law)((F¯,A)∧(G¯,B))∧(H¯,C)=(F¯,A)∧((G¯,B)∧(H¯,C))((F¯,A)∨(G¯,B))∨(H¯,C)=(F¯,A)∨((G¯,B)∨(H¯,C)).(2) (Distribution law)(F¯,A)∧((G¯,B)∨(H¯,C))=((F¯,A)∧(G¯,B))∨((F¯,A)∧(H¯,C));(F¯,A)∨((G¯,B)∧(H¯,C))=((F¯,A)∨(G¯,B))∧((F¯,A)∨(H¯,C)).We just verify the first conclusion of the two laws, respectively.(1) For any parameters ɛ∈A, ς∈B, ζ∈C,F¯(ε)={s˜F¯(ε)=[sα(u),sβ(u)]|u∈U},G¯(ς)={s˜G¯(ς)=[sα′(u),sβ′(u)]|u∈U}andH¯(ζ)={s˜H¯(ζ)=[sα″(u),sβ″(u)]|u∈U}, then((F¯,A)∧(G¯,B))∧(H¯,C)=[min{sα(u),sα′(u)},min{sβ(u),sβ′(u)}]∧(H¯,C)=[min{min{sα(u),sα′(u)},sα″(u)},min{min{sβ(u),sβ′(u)},sβ″(u)}]=[min{sα(u),sα′(u),sα″(u)},min{sβ(u),sβ′(u),sβ″(u)}]=[min{sα(u),min{sα′(u),sα″(u)}},min{sβ(u),min{sβ′(u),sβ″(u)}}]=(F¯,A)∧((G¯,B)∧(H¯,C)).Thus, the conclusion that((F¯,A)∧(G¯,B))∧(H¯,C)=(F¯,A)∧((G¯,B)∧(H¯,C))holds. Similarly, the result((F¯,A)∨(G¯,B))∨(H¯,C)=(F¯,A)∨((G¯,B)∨(H¯,C))also holds.(2)(F¯,A)∧((G¯,B)∨(H¯,C))=(F¯,A)∧[max{sα′(u),sα″(u)},max{sβ′(u),sβ″(u)}](11)=[min{sα(u),max{sα′(u),sα″(u)}},min{sβ(u),max{sβ′(u),sβ″(u)}}].It is easy to verify that for any real numbers a, b and c, the following conclusion holds:min{a,max{b,c}}=max{min{a,b},min{a,c}}.Thus, Eq. (11) can also be rewritten as follows:[max{min{sα(u),sα′(u)},min{sα(u),sα″(u)}},max{min{sα(u),sα′(u)},min{sα(u),sα″(u)}}]=((F¯,A)∧(G¯,B))∨((F¯,A)∧(H¯,C)).Thus, the conclusion that(F¯,A)∧((G¯,B)∨(H¯,C))=((F¯,A)∧(G¯,B))∨((F¯,A)∧(H¯,C))holds.Similarly, the result(F¯,A)∨((G¯,B)∧(H¯,C))=((F¯,A)∨(G¯,B))∧((F¯,A)∨(H¯,C))also holds.This proves Theorem 3.2.The algebra operations for some kinds of soft sets have been published, Neog et al. [26,27] have introduced the addition operation for fuzzy soft matrices. In many practical issues, such as the group decision making [5,10,12,17,19,23], one has to combine the decision information given by different decision makers. Therefore, it is necessary to study the algebra operations for ULFSSs. Lan et al. [28] developed a novel addition operation for uncertain linguistic information based on extended triangular conorms, which can be applied to define some operations for ULFSSs.Definition 3.9(see [28]). For any two uncertain linguistic valuess˜1=[sα1,sβ1]ands˜2=[sα2,sβ2], we have(12)s˜1⊕¯s˜2=[sα1,sβ1]⊕¯[sα2,sβ2]=[sf−1(f(α1)+f(α2)),sf−1(f(β1)+f(β2))],and(13)λ⊙¯s˜1=λ⊙¯[sα1,sβ1]=[sf−1(λf(α1)),sf−1(λf(β1))],where f:[0, t)→[0, +∞) is a strictly monotone increasing and continuous function satisfying f(0)=0, f(t)=+∞. The inverse function of f exists, which can be denoted by f−1.Assume that(F¯,A),(G¯,B)are two ULFSSs, λ>0 is a parameter, then some operations on(F¯,A),(G¯,B)are defined as follows:(1)(F¯,A)⊕¯(G¯,B)=(s˜F¯(ej)(ui)⊕¯s˜G¯(ej)(ui))ej∈E,ui∈U;λ⋅(F¯,A)=(λ⋅s˜F¯(ej)(ui))ej∈E,ui∈U.According to Definition 3.10, both of the results produced by the addition operation and the scalar multiplication operation are ULFSSs.Proposition 3.4Given that(F¯,A),(G¯,B)are two ULFSSs and λ, λ1, λ2>0, then(1)(F¯,A)⊕¯(G¯,B)=(G¯,B)⊕¯(F¯,A);λ⊙¯((F¯,A)⊕¯(G¯,B))=λ⊙¯(F¯,A)⊕¯λ⊙¯(G¯,B);(λ1+λ2)⊙¯(F¯,A)=λ1⊙¯(F¯,A)⊕¯λ2⊙¯(F¯,A).(1) It is easy to verify the result, thus it is omitted.(2) According to Definition 3.10,(F¯,A)⊕¯(G¯,B)=(s˜F¯(ej)(ui)⊕¯s˜G¯(ej)(ui))ej∈E,ui∈U.Assume thats˜F¯(ej)(ui)=[sαij,sβij]ands˜G¯(ej)(ui)=[sα′ij,sβ′ij], for fixed ej∈E and ui∈U, then with Definition 3.9 and Eq. (11), we have(14)s˜F¯(ej)(ui)⊕¯s˜G¯(ej)(ui)=[sf−1(f(αij)+f(α′ij)),sf−1(f(βij)+f(βij))].Then according to Eqs. (13) and (14),(15)λ⊙¯((F¯,A)⊕¯(G¯,B))=[sf−1(λf[f−1(f(αij)+f(α′ij))]),sf−1(λf[f−1(f(βij)+f(β′ij))])]=[sf−1(λ(f(αij)+f(α′ij))),sf−1(λ(f(βij)+f(β′ij)))],and(16)λ⊙¯(F¯,A)⊕¯λ⊙¯(G¯,B)=[sf−1(λf(αij)),sf−1(λf(βij))]⊕¯[sf−1(λf(α′ij)),sf−1(λf(β′ij))]=[sf−1(f[f−1(λf(αij))]+f[f−1(λf(α′ij))]),sf−1(f[f−1(λf(βij))]+f[f−1(λf(β′ij))])]=[sf−1(λf(αij)+λf(α′ij)),sf−1(λf(βij)+λf(β′ij))]=[sf−1(λ[f(αij)+f(α′ij)]),sf−1(λ[f(βij)+f(β′ij)])].Thus, according to Eqs. (15) and (16), the second equality holds.(3) The proof is similar to that of (2), thus it is omitted.This proves Proposition 3.4.Note that with different kinds of function f, the operations would also be different, for example, f(x)=x/t(t−x), x∈[0, t) in Ref. [28], etc.Proposition 3.5The operational laws mentioned above are also feasible to the case of unbalanced linguistic variables[31,32].Multiple attributes group decision making (MAGDM) issue is a practical process of selecting the best alternative(s) with respect to a number of attributes from a given set of all feasible alternatives. In this section, we consider a kind of MAGDM problem using the knowledge of ULFSSs.Let U={u1, u2, …, um} be a set of all feasible alternatives and E={e1, e2, …, en} be a collection of attributes considered by l decision makers D={d1, d2, …, dl}. Because of time pressure or the lack of knowledge, the decision makers cannot provide a crisp value to alternatives ui∈U with respect to the jth attribute ej∈E. In this model, we apply the form of soft set with uncertain linguistic information, where the evaluated value of all alternatives with respect to the jth attribute ej∈E given by the kth DM is denoted asF¯(k)(ej)=(s˜F¯(k)(ej)(ui))ui∈U. For the sake of obtaining the final evaluated values of all alternatives, one has to consider the weights of all DMs, which are used to measure the importance of the DMs in decision process. Given that the weighting vector is ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωl)T, which satisfies the condition that 0≤ωj≤1 and∑j=1lωj=1.For the reason that the weighting vector is not always known before making a decision, thus, we first propose an approach to determine the weights.Hereinafter, we use the equivalent definition of ULFSS defined in Definition 3.3. Suppose that for fixed u∈U,F¯¯(k)(ui)=(s˜F¯¯(k)(ui)(ej))ej∈Eis a u-approximate element, the uncertain linguistic values represent the attitude of the kth DM toward the alternatives. For convenience, given thatF¯¯(k)=(F¯¯(k)(ui))m×1=(s˜ij(k))m×n=[sαij(k),sβij(k)]m×n, k=1, 2, …, l is the uncertain linguistic fuzzy set given by the kth DM.Definition 4.1(F¯¯,U)is said to be the aggregated uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set by considering the weighting vector, the u-approximate elementF¯¯(ui)in(F¯¯,U)is defined according to(17)F¯¯(ui)=∑k=1lωk⊙¯F¯¯(k)(ui)=∑k=1lωk⊙¯(s˜F¯¯(k)(ui)(ej))ej∈E.To obtain an objective weighting vector ω, the following factors are considered:(Q1) From the role of alternatives, the aggregated result according to Eq. (17) should be closer with the maximum u-approximate element;(Q2) For measure more exactly, the aggregated result according to Eq. (17) should be far away from the minimum u-approximate element;(Q3) According to the maximum entropy theory, the entropy of the weight vector should attach the maximum.By considering the questions mentioned above, we can construct the following multi-objective optimization model:minz1(ω1,ω2,…,ωl)=dF¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u+),i=1,2,…,mmaxz2(ω1,ω2,…,ωl)=dF¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u−),i=1,2,…,m(MOD1)maxz3(ω1,ω2,…,ωl)=−∑k=1lωkln(ωk)s.t.∑k=1lωk=10≤ωk≤1,k=1,2,…,l.where d is a distance measure between two u-approximate elements,F¯¯(u+)andF¯¯(u−)are the positive ideal and negative ideal u-approximate element, respectively.LetF¯¯(u1)=s˜F¯¯(u1)(ej)ej∈EandF¯¯(u2)=s˜F¯¯(u2)(ej)ej∈Ebe two u-approximate elements, a feasible distance measure can be defined according to:(18)d(F¯¯(u1),F¯¯(u2))=1n∑j=1nd(s˜F¯¯(u1)(ej),s˜F¯¯(u2)(ej))=1n∑j=1n(|α1j−α2j|+|β1j−β2j|).(MOD 1) is a multiple non-linear optimization model, we can transform it into a single objective optimization model by adding a attitude parameter θ, where(MOD2)maxz(ω1,ω2,…,ωl)=θ⋅1n∑i=1md(F¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u−))d(F¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u+))+d(F¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u−))−1−θ⋅∑k=1lωkln(ωk)s.t.∑k=1lωk=10≤ωk≤1,k=1,2,…,l..From (MOD 2), for each alternative ui∈U, the objectives z1 and z2 are equipotent, we use the ratio to measure the two objectives for each alternative and the mean for all alternatives in U. The attitude parameter θ represents the attitude of DM toward different objectives.There exist other formats of cases of weighting vector, denoted by ω∈Φ, such as ωj≥ωk, ωj−ωk≥ai, ωj≥bjωk, cj≤ωj≤ωj+dj, ωj−ωk≥ωl−ωq(ai, bj, cj, djare real numbers).(MOD 2) is also a non-linear optimization model, which can be solved by some basic mathematical software, such as Matlab 2013a, Lingo 11.0.In sum, an approach for MAGDM on the basis of (MOD 2) with uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft information, using the extended TOPSIS approach, is given in the following steps:Step 1. Obtaining individual ULFSS provided by each DM.Each DM dkgives his/her evaluationF¯¯(k)(ui)on each alternative ui∈U toward all attributes, which is the approximate element of(F¯¯(k),U).Step 2. Determining the positive ideal and negative ideal u-approximate elementF¯¯(u+)andF¯¯(u−).According to the definition of uncertain linguistic fuzzy set defined in Definition 3.1, we fixF¯¯(u+)andF¯¯(u−)as follows:F¯¯(u+)={[sg,sg]/ej}ej∈EandF¯¯(u−)={[s0,s0]/ej}ej∈E.Step 3. Calculating the weighting vector of DMs using the non-linear optimization model (MOD 2) proposed above.Step 4. Computing the aggregated uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set(F¯¯,U)by considering the weighting vector, which is a collection of u-approximate elementF¯¯(ui)obtained by using Eq. (17).Step 5. Calculating the distance measures between each aggregated uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft u-approximate elementF¯¯(ui)and the fixed ideal u-approximate element given in Step 2, denoted byd(F¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u+))andd(F¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u−)).Step 6. Obtaining the relative closeness of each individual alternative according to(19)ci=d(F¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u−))d(F¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u−))+d(F¯¯(ui),F¯¯(u+)),i=1,2,…,m.Step 7. Ranking the alternatives based on the values of ci, i=1, 2, …, m.We always hope that the alternative's collective decision value should be more closer with the positive ideal approximate element and be further away from the negative approximate element, thus we can get the ordering of all alternatives according to the decreasing order of ci, i=1, 2, …, m.Step 8. Select the best alternative(s).Step 9. End.According to Eqs. (17) and (18) and (MOD2), the time complexity of the examined method is O(n3), wheren=maxn1,n2,n3, n1 is the number of alternatives, n2 is the number of attributes, n3 is the number of experts in the group decision making.The decision procedure can be shown in Fig. 2.As shown in Fig. 2, the decision information is given in the form of soft set, but not traditional discrete information. The decision process includes two phrases: the aggregation phrase and the exploitation phase using TOPSIS technology. In the aggregation phrase, the collective uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set is obtained by using the weighting vector of decision makers obtained according to (MOD2). While in the exploitation phase, the TOPSIS technique is utilized to all alternatives so that the final decision result can be gotten.According to Asih [41], the methods of using TOPSIS technique to handle MAGDM can be classified into internal aggregation and external aggregation. Actually, our developed decision algorithm is actually the external aggregation process, i.e., the TOPSIS technique is applied to the collective decision information that is aggregated from the individual decision information.In order to illustrate the application of the proposed decision procedure based on uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft sets, the following two cases are considered.In this subsection, we first consider a case study of selecting feasible candidate(s) adapted from Fan and Liu [29] and Chen [37] to illustrate the application of proposed decision procedure.Assume that a software company wants to hire a system analysis engineer. After preliminary screening, three alternatives v1, v2 and v3 are considered for further decision. Three experts d1, d2 and d3 are formed to finish the interview and to select the best choice(s). The following five attributes are considered by the experts for evaluation:(1)Emotional steadiness (A1);Oral communication skill (A2);Personality (A3);Past experience (A4);Self-confidence (A5).Given that the experts use multi-granularity linguistic term sets to express their evaluations, whered1:S1={s01,s11,s21,s31,s41};d2:S2={s02,s12,s22,s32,s42,s52,s62};d3:S3={s03,s13,s23,s33,s43,s53,s63,s73,s83};The preference information on three alternatives with respect to five attributes provided by three experts is listed in Tables 4–6.The solution process can be shown as follows:Step 1. Three individual ULFSSs provided by DMs are listed in the following:Since the linguistic term sets of the experts are multi-granularity, to eliminate the affection of granularities, the following transformation formula proposed by Herrera and Martínez [38] and Herrera et al. [31] can be applied:(20)TFt′t(sαn(t))=Δt′Δt−1(sαn(t))(n(t′)−1)n(t)−1,where t, t′∈{1, 2, 3} and n(t), n(t′) are corresponding granularities ofSt,St′, Δt:St→[0, n(t)] andΔt−1is the inverse function of Δt.By using Eq. (20), let t′=2, t∈{1, 3}, i.e., the semantics in S1 and S3 are transformed to corresponding semantics that in S2, then(F¯¯(1),U)=F¯¯(1)(v1)F¯¯(1)(v2)F¯¯(1)(v3)=[s3,s4.5]A1,[s4.5,s6]/A2,[s1.5,s4.5]/A3,[s4.5,s6]/A4,[s1.5,s4.5]/A5[s3,s6]/A1,[s3,s6]/A2,[s4.5,s6]/A3,[s3,s6]/A4,[s3,s6]/A5[s4.5,s6]/A1,[s3,s4.5]/A2,[s3,s6]/A3,[s3,s6]/A4,[s4.5,s6]/A5;(F¯¯(2),U)=F¯¯(1)(v1)F¯¯(1)(v2)F¯¯(1)(v3)=[s4,s6]/A1,[s3,s6]/A2,[s4,s6]/A3,[s3,s5]/A4,[s2,s5]/A5[s4,s6]/A1,[s3,s6]/A2,[s4,s6]/A3,[s4,s6]/A4,[s3,s5]/A5[s3,s5]/A1,[s3,s5]/A2,[s3,s5]/A3,[s5,s6]/A4,[s3,s5]/A5;(F¯¯(3),U)=F¯¯(1)(v1)F¯¯(1)(v2)F¯¯(1)(v3)=[s3.75,s5.25]/A1,[s2.25,s4.5]/A2,[s3.75,s6]/A3,[s3.75,s6]/A4,[s2.25,s3.75]/A5[s2.25,s5.25]/A1,[s3.75,s6]/A2,[s2.25,s5.25]/A3,[s4.5,s6]/A4,[s2.25,s4.5]/A5[s2.25,s5.25]/A1,[s3.75,s6]/A2,[s5.25,s6]/A3,[s3,s5.25]/A4,[s3.75,s6]A5.Step 2. Determining the positive ideal and negative ideal u-approximate elementF¯¯(u+)andF¯¯(u−).F¯¯(v+)=[s6,s6]A1,[s6,s6]A2,[s6,s6]A3,[s6,s6]A4,[s6,s6]A5;F¯¯(v+)=[s0,s0]A1,[s0,s0]A2,[s0,s0]A3,[s0,s0]A4,[s0,s0]A5.Step 3. Calculating the weighting vector of DMs using the non-linear optimization model (MOD 2).Assume that if f(x)=x/[6(6−x), x∈[0, 6), then we have(MOD3)maxz(ω1,ω2,ω3)=θ⋅z′(ω1,ω2,ω3)−(1−θ)⋅∑k=13ωkln(ωk)s.t.∑k=13ωk=10≤ωk≤1,k=1,2,3.wherez′=16∑i=16∑j=15f−1∑k=13ωkf(αij(k))+f−1∑k=13ωkf(βij(k))∑j=15f−1∑k=13ωkf(αij(k))+f−1∑k=13ωkf(βij(k))+∑j=17f−1∑k=13ωkf(αij(k))−6+f−1∑k=13ωkf(βij(k))−6.Solve the optimization model (MOD 3), the results areω1=0.3343,ω2=0.3340,ω3=0.3317.Step 4. Computing the aggregated uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set(F¯¯,U)by considering the weighting vector, thenF¯¯(v1)=(0.3343⊙¯F¯¯(1)(v1))⊕¯(0.3340⊙¯F¯¯(2)(v1))⊕¯(0.3317⊙¯F¯¯(3)(v1))=[s3.58,s5.25]A1,[s3.25,s5.5]A2,[s3.08,s5.5]A3,[s3.75,s5.67]A4,[s1.92,s4.42]A5.Similarly, we haveF¯¯(v2)=[s3.09,s5.75]A1,[s3.25,s6]A2,[s3.59,s5.75]A3,[s3.83,s6]A4,[s2.75,s5.17]A5;F¯¯(v3)=[s3.25,s5.42]A1,[s3.25,s5.16]A2,[s3.75,s5.67]A3,[s3.67,s5.75]A4,[s3.75,s5.67]A5.Step 5. Calculating the distance between each aggregated uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft u-approximate elementF¯¯(ui)and the fixed ideal u-approximate element given in Step 2, the results are listed as follows:d(F¯¯(v1),F¯¯(u+))=3.3164,d(F¯¯(v2),F¯¯(u+))=2.9651,d(F¯¯(v3),F¯¯(u+))=2.9338.andd(F¯¯(u1),F¯¯(u−))=8.3836,d(F¯¯(u2),F¯¯(u−))=9.0349,d(F¯¯(u3),F¯¯(u−))=9.0662.Step 6. Calculating the relative closeness of each individual alternative according to Eq. (19), thenc1=0.6986,c2=0.7529,c3=0.7555.Step 7. According to the calculated result in Step 6, we can deduce that the ranking of the alternatives should bev3≻v2≻v1.where the notation a≻b represents that a is ‘better’ than b.Step 8. Therefore, the alternative v3 is the best choice.Step 9. End.Noting that the result produced by our approach is different from Refs. [29,37], a possible reason of this phenomenon may be the affection of the weighting vector, i.e., we use a crisp weighting vector to measure the importance of experts, while in Refs. [29,37], a trapezoidal fuzzy weighting vector is utilized.In order to make a comparison, we apply the approach proposed by Fan and Liu [29] to the transformed decision information in our case.According to Eq. (3) in Ref. [29], corresponding trapezoidal fuzzy decision matrices of our transformed decision information are:F˜1=(.385,.462,.769,.846)(.615,.692,1,1)(.154,.231,.769,.846)(.615,.692,1,1)(.154,.231,.769,.846)(.385,.462,1,1)(.385,.462,1,1)(.615,.692,1,1)(.385,.462,1,1)(.385,.462,1,1)(.615,.692,1,1)(.385,.462,.769,.846)(.385,.462,1,1)(.385,.462,1,1)(.615,.692,1,1);F˜2=(.539,.615,1,1)(.385,.462,1,1)(.539,.615,1,1)(.385,.462,.846,.923)(.231,.308,.846,.923)(.539,.615,1,1)(.385,.462,1,1)(.539,.615,1,1)(.539,.615,1,1)(.385,.462,.846,.923)(.385,.462,.846,.923)(.385,.462,.846,.923)(.385,.462,.846,.923)(.692,.769,1,1)(.385,.462,.846,.923)F˜3=(.500,.577,.885,.962)(.269,.346,.769,.846)(.500,.577,1,1)(.500,.577,1,1)(.269,.346,.654,.731)(.269,.346,.885,.962)(.500,.577,1,1)(.269,.346,.885,.962)(.615,.692,1,1)(.269,.346,.769,.846)(.269,.346,.885,.962)(.500,.577,1,1)(.731,.808,1,1)(.385,.462,.885,.962)(.500,.577,1,1).Corresponding weighting vectors are given as follows [29]:W˜1=(.333,.444,1,1),(.556,.667,1,1),(.556,.667,1,1),(.556,.667,1,1),(.111,.222,.778,.889);W˜2=(.538,.615,1,1),(.692,.769,1,1),(.385,.462,.846,.923),(.692,.769,1,1),(.385,.462,.846,.923);W˜3=(.529,.558,.882,.941),(.647,.706,1,1),(.529,.558,.882,.941),(.647,.706,1,1),(.412,.471,.765,.824).Then, the weighted fuzzy matricesA˜t=(a˜tij)3×5,t=1,2,3, wherea˜tij=w˜tj⊗f˜tijandW˜t=(w˜tj)1×5,F˜t=(f˜tij)3×5, can be listed as follows:A˜1=(.128,.205,.769,.846)(.342,.462,1,1)(.086,.154,.769,.846)(.342,.362,1,1)(.017,.051,.599,.752)(.179,.273,1,1)(.214,.308,1,1)(.299,.411,1,1)(.214,.308,.846,.923)(.026,.068,.658,.821)(.167,.256,.885,.962)(.150,.231,.769,.846)(.278,.385,1,1)(.278,.385,1,1)(.030,.077,.509,.650);A˜2=(.207,.284,1,1)(.266,.355,1,1)(.237,.320,.846,.923)(.266,.355,1,1)(.148,.213,.846,.923)(.290,.379,1,1)(.266,.355,1,1)(.207,.284,.846,.923)(.373,.473,1,1)(.148,.213,.716,.852)(.145,.213,.885,.962)(.346,.444,1,1)(.104,.160,.748,.888)(.426,.532,1,1)(.103,.160,.651,.781);A˜3=(.326,.386,.882,.941)(.249,.326,.769,.846)(.204,.258,.882,.941)(.132,.192,1,1)(.254,.326,.765,.824)(.204,.258,.746,.869)(.249,.326,.846,.923)(.204,.258,.746,.869)(.237,.319,1,1)(.159,.217,.647,.761)(.142,.193,.780,.905)(.324,.407,1,1)(.387,.451,.882,.941)(.132,.192,.885,.962)(.206,.272,.765,.824).Finally, according to the following fuzzy positive-ideal solution (FPIS)A˜(+)and fuzzy negative-ideal solution (FPNS)A˜(−),A˜(+)=(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1)(1,1,1,1),A˜(−)=(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0)(0,0,0,0).The distance of each alternative from FPIS and FNIS is shown as follows:D1(+)=9.2263,D2(+)=8.1734,D3(+)=8.8380,D1(−)=22.8594,D2(−)=24.0938,D3(−)=22.6193.Thus, the closeness coefficient of each alternative can be calculated, i.e.,CC1=0.7124,CC2=0.7467,CC3=0.7190.Therefore, it can be obtained thatv2≻v3≻v1, i.e.,v2is the best selection, which is the same with the conclusion produced by Fan and Liu [29].Correspondingly, it can be seen that the result would be the same if the decision information listed in(F¯¯(t),U), t=1, 2, 3 are combined with the existed weighting vector and decision procedure, which also shows the validity of the proposed method.Table 7shows the influence of θ to the weighting vector in our approach.According to Table 7, the following basic conclusions can be obtained:(1)Corresponding to different values of the parameter θ, the weight vectors are also not the same. What's more, if we compute the entropy of these triples, one can see that the entropy is descending with the increasing of parameter θ, because the attitude of DM toward the objective of maximum entropy is weaker with the increasing of parameter θWhen θ≤0.9, the ranking of ω1, ω2 and ω3 are regular, i.e., ω1≥ω2≥ω3 however, when θ>0.9, the orders of three weights are irregular. Besides, the values of ω1 are more stable. This conclusion can be visualized in Fig. 3.The assessment of sound quality is of great importance for the judgment of sound, especially for musical works or sound equipments. Because of the blur of sound quality assessment, a multi-dimensional scaling method is usually applied to make an assessment according to the classification given by Linkwitz. lab, for instance, the clarity/articulation/speed, instantaneous volume-range, spaciousness/openness, size of virtual sound image, width and height of sound stage, etc. According to Alf and Björn [40], seven factors which could be used to evaluate the quality, such as clarity/cleanness (e1), fullness (e2), spaciousness/openness (e3), brightness (e4), softness (e5), absence of extraneous sounds (e6) and fidelity (e7). Corresponding to different factors, different linguistic term sets with the same granularities but discrepant meanings. For convenience, we summarize these linguistic term sets as follows:S={s0=min (Min), s1=very poor (VP), s3=rather poor (RP), s5=midway (Mid), s7=rather good (RG), s9=very good (VG), s10=max (Max)}.In practice, because of the fuzziness of human's thought, it would be simultaneous that the evaluated vocals are judged at the granularities pointed out. Thus, the uncertain linguistic information would be used to evaluate rather than crisp linguistic evaluations. As a result, the linguistic term setSis extend to the following continuous form:S¯={s˜⊆[s0,s10]}.In order to estimate the quality of given sound samples, denoted asV={v1,…,v6}, a final ranking of such 6 sound samples would be produced according to the following uncertain linguistic information provided by four evaluators D={d1, d2, d3, d4} (see Tables 8–11).In Section 6, we will apply the approach mentioned above to solve such kind of decision making issues.Similar to the decision process of selection of feasible candidate(s), the evaluation of sound samples can be summarized as follows:By using the concept of ULFSS, four individual ULFSSs provided by evaluators are listed in the following:(F¯¯(1),U)=F¯¯(1)(v1)F¯¯(1)(v2)F¯¯(1)(v3)F¯¯(1)(v4)F¯¯(1)(v5)F¯¯(1)(v6)=[s9,s10]/e1,[s7,s8]/e2,[s6,s7]/e3,[s9,s10]/e4,[s9,s10]/e5,[s8,s9]/e6,[s7,s9]/e7[s7,s8]/e1,[s8,s9]/e2,[s9,s10]/e3,[s5,s7]/e4,[s7,s9]/e5,[s6,s8]/e6,[s8,s10]/e7[s7,s9]/e1,[s8,s10]/e2,[s8,s10]/e3,[s7,s8]/e4,[s8,s9]/e5,[s9,s10]/e6,[s7,s9]/e7[s7,s8]/e1,[s6,s8]/e2,[s8,s9]/e3,[s8,s10]/e4,[s9,s10]/e5,[s7,s9]/e6,[s6,s8]/e7[s9,s10]/e1,[s7,s9]/e2,[s7,s8]/e3,[s7,s8]/e4,[s8,s9]/e5,[s8,s10]/e6,[s6,s9]/e7[s6,s7]/e1,[s8,s10]/e2,[s8,s10]/e3,[s8,s9]/e4,[s6,s9]/e5,[s7,s9]/e6,[s9,s10]/e7;(F¯¯(2),U)=F¯¯(2)(v1)F¯¯(2)(v2)F¯¯(2)(v3)F¯¯(2)(v4)F¯¯(2)(v5)F¯¯(2)(v6)=[s8,s9]/e1,[s6,s8]/e2,[s5,s7]/e3,[s8,s10]/e4,[s7,s8]/e5,[s8,s9]/e6,[s8,s10]/e7[s7,s9]/e1,[s9,s10]/e2,[s9,s10]/e3,[s6,s7]/e4,[s8,s9]/e5,[s7,s9]/e6,[s6,s9]/e7[s7,s8]/e1,[s8,s9]/e2,[s9,s10]/e3,[s8,s9]/e4,[s9,s10]/e5,[s8,s9]/e6,[s7,s8]/e7[s6,s8]/e1,[s7,s8]/e2,[s7,s8]/e3,[s9,s10]/e4,[s7,s9]/e5,[s9,s10]/e6,[s8,s9]/e7[s8,s10]/e1,[s8,s9]/e2,[s8,s9]/e3,[s8,s9]/e4,[s8,s10]/e5,[s8,s9]/e6,[s8,s10]/e7[s7,s9]/e1,[s7,s9]/e2,[s9,s10]/e3,[s7,s9]/e4,[s7,s8]/e5,[s6,s9]/e6,[s7,s9]/e7;(F¯¯(3),U)=F¯¯(3)(v1)F¯¯(3)(v2)F¯¯(3)(v3)F¯¯(3)(v4)F¯¯(3)(v5)F¯¯(3)(v6)=[s8,s9]/e1,[s6,s8]/e2,[s9,s10]/e3,[s8,s9]/e4,[s9,s10]/e5,[s7,s8]/e6,[s8,s9]/e7[s9,s10]/e1,[s7,s8]/e2,[s8,s9]/e3,[s6,s7]/e4,[s7,s9]/e5,[s9,s10]/e6,[s7,s8]/e7[s7,s8]/e1,[s8,s9]/e2,[s7,s8]/e3,[s9,s10]/e4,[s8,s9]/e5,[s6,s7]/e6,[s8,s10]/e7[s7,s8]/e1,[s9,s10]/e2,[s8,s10]/e3,[s8,s10]/e4,[s6,s8]/e5,[s8,s9]/e6,[s7,s8]/e7[s8,s9]/e1,[s8,s10]/e2,[s8,s9]/e3,[s7,s8]/e4,[s8,s9]/e5,[s9,s10]/e6,[s7,s9]/e7[s7,s9]/e1,[s8,s9]/e2,[s9,s10]/e3,[s8,s9]/e4,[s7,s8]/e5,[s7,s8]/e6,[s6,s9]/e7;(F¯¯(4),U)=F¯¯(4)(v1)F¯¯(4)(v2)F¯¯(4)(v3)F¯¯(4)(v4)F¯¯(4)(v5)F¯¯(4)(v6)=[s7,s9]/e1,[s7,s8]/e2,[s8,s9]/e3,[s7,s8]/e4,[s8,s9]/e5,[s7,s9]/e6,[s7,s9]/e7[s7,s8]/e1,[s7,s9]/e2,[s8,s10]/e3,[s8,s9]/e4,[s8,s9]/e5,[s9,s10]/e6,[s7,s8]/e7[s8,s9]/e1,[s9,s10]/e2,[s7,s9]/e3,[s9,s10]/e4,[s9,s10]/e5,[s8,s9]/e6,[s9,s10]/e7[s7,s8]/e1,[s8,s9]/e2,[s8,s9]/e3,[s8,s10]/e4,[s7,s8]/e5,[s6,s7]/e6,[s7,s8]/e7[s8,s10]/e1,[s8,s9]/e2,[s7,s9]/e3,[s6,s7]/e4,[s7,s9]/e5,[s9,s10]/e6,[s8,s9]/e7[s7,s8]/e1,[s7,s9]/e2,[s8,s9]/e3,[s8,s9]/e4,[s7,s8]/e5,[s7,s9]/e6,[s6,s9]/e7.The positive ideal and negative ideal u-approximate elementF¯¯(u+)andF¯¯(u−)corresponding to the new case are determined according toF¯¯(u+)=[s10,s10]e1,[s10,s10]e2,[s10,s10]e3,[s10,s10]e4,[s10,s10]e5,[s10,s10]e6,[s10,s10]e7;F¯¯(u−)=[s0,s0]e1,[s0,s0]e2,[s0,s0]e3,[s0,s0]e4,[s0,s0]e5,[s0,s0]e6,[s0,s0]e7.Let f(x)=x/10(10−x), x∈[0, 10), the weighting vector of evaluators can be obtained from the following optimization model:(MOD3)maxz(ω1,ω2,ω3,ω4)=θ⋅z′(ω1,ω2,ω3,ω4)−(1−θ)⋅∑k=14ωkln(ωk)s.t.∑k=14ωk=10≤ωk≤1,k=1,2,…,4.wherez′=16∑i=16∑j=17f−1∑k=14ωkf(αij(k))+f−1∑k=14ωkf(βij(k))∑j=17f−1∑k=14ωkf(αij(k))+f−1∑k=14ωkf(βij(k))+∑j=17f−1∑k=14ωkf(αij(k))−10+f−1∑k=14ωkf(βij(k))−10.Solve (MOD 3), the results areω1=0.2310,ω2=0.2369,ω3=0.2500,ω4=0.2821.Thus, the aggregated uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set(F¯¯,U)by considering the weighting vector can be listed as follows:F¯¯(v1)=[s7.79,s9]e1,[s6.34,s8]e2,[s7.94,s10]e3,[s7.79,s10]e4,[s8.17,s10]e5,[s7.57,s8.86]e6,[s7.79,s10]e7;F¯¯(v2)=[s8,s10]e1,[s8.11,s10]e2,[s8.64,s10]e3,[s6.76,s8.08]e4,[s7.62,s9]e5,[s8.50,s10]e6,[s7.16,s10]e7,;F¯¯(v3)=[s7,s8.38]e1,[s7.79,s10]e2,[s8.27,s10]e3,[s8.29,s10]e4,[s8.38,s10]e5,[s8.56,s10]e6,[s7,s8.38]e7,;F¯¯(v4)=[s6.81,s8]e1,[s8.11,s10]e2,[s7.83,s10]e3,[s8.38,s10]e4,[s7.86,s10]e5,[s8.04,s10]e6,[s7.17,s8.38]e7,;F¯¯(v5)=[s6.82,s8.58]e1,[s7.58,s10]e2,[s8.65,s10]e3,[s7.83,s9]e4,[s6.82,s8.38]e5,[s6.81,s8.56]e6,[s7.74,s10]e7;F¯¯(v6)=[s8.38,s10]e1,[s7.63,s10]e2,[s7.19,s8.87]e3,[s7.14,s8.25]e4,[s8.25,s10]e5,[s8.62,s10]e6,[s7.23,s10]e7,.By using Eqs. (18) and (19), the relative closeness degrees of all alternatives are obtained and shown as follows:c1=0.8518,c2=0.8776,c3=0.8718,c4=0.8613,c5=0.8362,c6=0.8683Therefore, the order of six alternatives can be ranked according tov2≻v3≻v6≻v4≻v1≻v5.where the notation a≻b represents that a is greater than b, i.e.,v2is the best choice. The affection of the parameter θ can also be similarly determined, which is omitted.In this paper, the uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set offers a novel mathematical way for handling group decision making with uncertain linguistic variables. Different from some existing works, the advantages of the proposed decision procedure can be summarized as follows:(1)Extending TOPSIS to GDM with uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft setsDifferent from existed MAGDM method based on TOPSIS under linguistic environment [42–46], the decision information in current algorithm is uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set. For the reason that the uncertain linguistic variable is an extension of linguistic variable, furthermore, by using the fuzzy linguistic approaches, it can be seen that the decision information here is more general.Simplifying the group decision processIn the traditional MAGDM problems, we should determine not only the weights of attributes, but also the weights of experts (see Fig. 4).As shown in Fig. 4, both of the weighting vectors of the decision maker and attribute are utilized. According to the individual decision information, there are two possible ways in the group decision process: (1) the decision procedure on the left hand side uses the weighting vector of decision makers firstly, and then applies the weighting vector of attributes to obtain the final decision information. (2) The decision procedure on the right hand side is just the opposite.In the proposed decision procedure, the requirement of the attributes’ weighting vector is unnecessary (see Fig. 2). We only need to obtain the weights of experts. Thus, the whole group decision process is simplified.Proposing the new decision procedure for GDM based on soft set theoryMoreover, compared with other soft set based group decision procedures, the developed uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set can be utilized to handle the situation that the evaluations are provided with subjective evaluated values of linguistic variable. Thus, the soft set method has now been extended to a more general situation. Besides, by introducing the algebra operations of soft sets, we have introduced an information aggregation approach for soft sets, which provides a new way to deal with soft sets based practical problems.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have investigated the concept of uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft set through combining the uncertain linguistic variables and soft set theory, i.e., the e-approximate element in a soft set was composed of uncertain linguistic fuzzy sets. Based on the binary relation, we studied the inclusion relation, the equal relation and the complement relation of ULFSSs. Two groups of operational laws for uncertain linguistic fuzzy soft sets have also been developed, which are said to be the set operations and algebra operations, the properties of such operations are also discussed. As an application of the new soft sets, we propose an algorithm for solving the ULFSSs based group decision making. To identify the weight vector of DMs, we put forward a non-linear optimization model on the basis of TOPSIS theory and the maximum entropy theory. Finally, a case of an assessment of candidates’ problem was shown to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach. The affection of the attitude parameter θ to the weight information is also studied in the case study.
