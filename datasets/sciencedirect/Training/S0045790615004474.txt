@&#MAIN-TITLE@&#
System design and mechatronics of an air supply station for air-powered scooters

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
An air supply station with mechanical and electrical systems was built.Two operation modes were designed for charging air bottles.An air-powered scooter was used to evaluate the design specifications and charging performance.Results confirm that the station produced high-pressure air for vehicles.Theoretical analysis and performance simulation will be conducted in the future.
