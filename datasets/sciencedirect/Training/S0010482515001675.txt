@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A spectrogram reflects the arrangement of nucleotides through the whole chromosome or genome. Our previous study suggested that the spectrogram of whole genome DNA sequences is a suitable tool for the determination of relationships among bacteria. Related bacteria have similar spectrograms, and similarity in spectrograms was measured using a color layout descriptor. Several parameters, such as the mapping of four bases into a spectrogram, the number of considered elements in the color layout descriptor, the color model of the image and the building tree method, can be changed. This study addresses the use of parameter selection to ensure the best classification results. The quality of the classification was measured by Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC). The proposed method with optimal parameters (called SpectCMP—Spectrogram CoMParison method) achieved an average MCC of 0.73 at the phylum level. The SpectCMP method was also tested at the order level; the average MCC in the classification of class Gammaproteobacteria was 0.76. The success of a classification with respect to the correct phyla was compared to three methods that are used in bacterial phylogeny: the CVTree method, OGTree method and moment vector method. The results show that the SpectCMP method can be used in bacterial classification at various taxonomic levels.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Identification of bacteria in medicine is essential for correct disease diagnosis, the treatment of infection and the trace-back of disease outbreaks that are associated with bacterial infections. Bacterial identification is used in the food industry for identification of a microbial contaminant that could be responsible for food spoilage, and it plays a key role in a wide variety of applications, including microbial forensics, bioterrorism threats and environmental studies [1,3]. It is generally agreed that the most useful way for scientists to organize organisms is to group them according to shared evolutionary history.Today, the universally accepted DNA sequence-based method for phylogeny reconstruction is a method that is based on a 16S rRNA gene comparison [4,5]. The 16S rRNA genes are found in all organisms, and they are highly conserved among different species. However, bacteria can have multiple copies of this gene, and this circumstance can make interpretation difficult when base pair changes exist among copies. Moreover, some bacterial taxa have identical 16S rRNA genes [6]. Therefore, alternative genes were used as phylogenetic markers [7]. If the single genes are used to construct the phylogeny, the single gene trees are often inconsistent to each other [8]. Multi-gene approaches to phylogenetic analysis are presented in [9,10].Phylogenetic information can be extracted from whole genome DNA sequences because single gene sequences do not contain sufficient information to construct an evolutionary history of organisms. If the entire genome is used instead of single genes, the data reflect the organism evolution and not the evolution of single genes. To compare single genes, sequence alignment is used. It does not make sense to align two complete genomes because every species has its own gene content and gene order in addition to different sizes of the genomes. In whole genome comparisons, identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion and deletion regions is used [11]. If the genomes share a set of common genes, those genomes can be compared by their gene content [8,12–14], gene order [15] or a combination of the gene order and gene content, e.g., the overlapping gene tree method (OGTree method) [16]. Previously mentioned methods are suitable for comparing closely related organisms. Two genomes can be compared by k-mer frequencies, e.g., the composition vector method (CVTree method) [17], feature frequency profile method [18] or return time distribution method [19]. A comparison of genomes by DNA graphical representation is presented in the moment vector method (MV method) [20] or frequency chaos game representation method [21].In our previous work [22], a new approach to whole genome comparison was introduced; this method is based on spectrogram comparisons. A spectrogram gives a combined view of the local periodicity throughout the nucleotide sequence, and it was introduced as a tool for the visualization of DNA sequences in [23]. In spectrograms, some patterns, which are often related to the sequence function or structure, are observed. A periodicity of 10bp reflects the DNA folding of bacteria [24]. A DNA sequence is often built from tandem repetitive regions (mostly in noncoding regions), which are clearly visible in a spectrogram as a series of horizontal lines. Therefore, the spectrogram was used as a tool for a tandem repetition search [25,26]. Furthermore, a spectrogram was used for the detection of protein-coding regions [27] because a strong periodicity at 3bp exists. A suggested method that compares whole genome spectrograms is an alignment-free method, which could be used for comparing organisms that could be distantly related and do not share a common set of genes.This work addresses parameter selection, which ensures the best possible results in bacterial classification. A method with an optimal parameter setting is called the Spectrogram CoMParison method (SpectCMP). The SpectCMP method was compared to three methods used in bacterial phylogeny: the CVTree method, OGTree method and MV method. Classification at the phylum and order level was studied.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Spectrograms revealed the properties of genomes, which can be used in interspecies studies. In our work, we optimized the method parameters for the determination of relationships of bacteria based on spectrogram comparisons. The quality of classification is affected most by the building tree method. The spectrum reducing method and color model type affected the results slightly. The optimal settings of the SpectCMP method are the following: the RGB model of the representative color image, division of the representative color image into 88 rows and columns, 1335 considered DCT coefficients in CLD, UPGMA as the building tree method, mapping guanine, cytosine and adenine to the red, green and blue layer, respectively, and mapping thymine to all three layers.The proposed SpectCMP method is an alignment-free method that is suitable for comparing closely related bacteria as well as for comparing distantly related bacteria that do not share a common set of genes. The method works with whole genome sequences; it does not require retrieving protein coding regions from the genome before data analysis. It was shown that the SpectCMP method is suitable for the classification of bacteria at different taxonomic levels as well.None
