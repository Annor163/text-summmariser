LetΔnbe a cell with a single interior vertex and n boundary verticesv1,…,vn. Say thatΔnhas the interpolation property if for everyz1,…,zn∈Rthere is a splines∈S21(Δn)such thats(vi)=zifor all i. We investigate under what conditions does a cell fail the interpolation property. The question is related to an open problem posed by Alfeld, Piper, and Schumaker in 1987 about characterization of unconfinable vertices.For hexagonal cells, we obtain a geometric criterion characterizing the failure of the interpolation property. As a corollary, we conclude that a hexagonal cell such that its six interior edges lie on three lines fails the interpolation property if and only if the cell is projectively equivalent to a regular hexagonal cell. Along the way, we obtain an explicit basis for the vector spaceS21(Δn)forn≥5.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Suppose that A is a finite set of points inR2. The condition that a polynomial of a fixed degree vanishes on A can be expressed as a system of linear equations in the coefficients of the polynomial. A classically studied problem asks under what conditions on A are these equations linearly independent. One example of a (classical) answer to that question appears in Fact 2.3. We consider a version of this problem, replacing polynomial functions with splines.Definition 0.1LetΔ6be a triangulation with one interior vertexv⁎and six boundary verticesv1,…,v6. We say thatΔ6has the interpolation property if for everyz1,…,z6∈Rthere iss∈S21(Δ6)such thats(vi)=zifori=1,…,6.We want to know when a cellΔ6has the interpolation property. This problem is related to the one posed by Alfeld, Piper, and Schumaker in Alfeld et al. (1987). They ask under what conditions do all the vertices of a cellΔn, including the interior vertex, fail to impose independent conditions onS21(Δn)(in the terminology of Alfeld et al. (1987), the interior vertex ofΔnis unconfinable). It is clear that ifΔnfails the interpolation property, then the interior vertex ofΔnis unconfinable; but we do not know whether the converse is true.It was shown in Alfeld et al. (1987) that if the interior vertex ofΔnis unconfinable, thenn≥6and n is even. Forn=6, Alfeld et al. (1987) show that ifΔ6is the triangulation of a regular (up to an affine transformation) hexagon such that its 6 interior edges lie on 3 lines, thenΔ6fails the interpolation property (and thus is unconfinable). But it was not clear, for instance, whether this is the only example of a hexagonal cell with an unconfinable interior vertex. The problem was mentioned again in Alfeld (2000).We show in Corollary 2.8 that ifΔ6is a triangulation such that all of its interior edges lie on three lines, thenΔ6fails the interpolation property if and only if the hexagon is regular up to a projective transformation. We obtain the corollary as a consequence of a more general characterization in Theorem 2.2. Both the corollary and the theorem allow us to describe new classes of hexagonal cells with an unconfinable interior vertex. It is worth noting that the characterization of the interpolation property we find has a distinct geometric flavor; this was also the case in the study of interpolation properties of linear splines (see Davydov et al., 2000, and references therein).A key tool in the analysis is a convenient explicit basis for the vector spaceS21(Δn),n≥5, obtained in Proposition 1.1. This is the content of Section 1. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the statements of the main results: Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.8. The proof of Theorem 2.2 is also in Section 2, modulo the proofs of two lemmas. We chose to separate the proofs of the two technical lemmas to Section 3 to make the structure of the main argument more transparent. Corollary 2.8 is proved in Section 4.LetΔnbe a cell with the interior vertexv⁎=(0,0). Given a counterclockwise sequential labeling{vi|1≤i≤n}of the boundary vertices ofΔn, we will denote, fori=1,…,n, byτithe edge containingv⁎andviand byσithe triangle with verticesv⁎,vi, andvi+1. We will use the convention that the index arithmetic is the arithmetic modulo n (so, for example,vn=v0,vn+1=v1, and so on).Letℓibe a linear form such that the lineℓi(x,y)=0contains the edgeτi. We will take the gradient ofℓito be the unit vector in the direction〈−yi,xi〉, where(xi,yi)are the coordinates ofvi. Letθi,j,1≤i<j≤ndenote the angle between the edgesτiandτj(or, equivalently, the angle between the gradients ofℓiandℓj).The symbold(vj,ℓi)will denote the (oriented) distance from the vertexvjto the lineℓi=0. Given the convention that the gradient ofℓiis a unit vector,d(vj,ℓi)is simply the valueℓi(vj); we use the notationd(vj,ℓi)to highlight that we are thinking of the quantity as the distance.The following proposition is the main result of this section.Proposition 1.1LetΔnbe a cell,n≥5. There is a sequential counterclockwise labeling of the boundary verticesvi,i=1,…,n, and a family{si|si∈S21(Δn),i=1,…,n−3}such that1.for eachi=1,…,n−3, the support ofsiis contained in the setσi∪σi+1∪σi+2andsi(vi+1)⋅si(vi+2)≠0;for eachi=1,…,n−3, we havesi(vi+1)si(vi+2)=d(vi+1,ℓi)⋅d(vi+1,ℓi+3)d(vi+2,ℓi)⋅d(vi+2,ℓi+3);the set of functionsB={1,x,y,x2,xy,y2,s1,…,sn−3}is a basis forS21(Δn).Definition 1.2A splinesithat satisfies (1) and (2) of Proposition 1.1 will be called a basic spline.The proof will consist of two parts: we first establish the existence of a single basic spline under a technical assumption about the angles between certain edges (Lemma 1.4). We then show in Lemma 1.5 that one can always label the boundary vertices so that the technical assumption is satisfied for sufficiently many edges.For Lemma 1.4, we will need the following identity.Fact 1.3Letai,bi∈Rfori∈{1,2,3}. Then|a12a22a32a1b1a2b2a3b3b12b22b32|=|a1a2b1b2|⋅|a2a3b2b3|⋅|a1a3b1b3|.The equality can be either verified directly, or obtained using Vandermonde determinant formula, so we omit the proof.Lemma 1.4Fixi∈{1,2,…,n−3}. Suppose that the anglesθi,i+2andθi+1,i+3are both acute. Then:(I)There is a non-zero vector(ki,0,…,ki,3), unique up to a constant multiple, such that for all(x,y)∈R2(1)∑j=03ki,jℓi+j2(x,y)=0.Namely,ki,j=(−1)j∏p<q∈{0,…,3}∖{j}sin⁡θi+p,i+q.Up to a constant multiple, there is a unique non-zero splinesi(x,y)∈S21(Δn)with the support contained inσi∪σi+1∪σi+2. The formula for this spline issi(x,y)={ki,0ℓi2(x,y),(x,y)∈σi,ki,0ℓi2(x,y)+ki,1ℓi+12(x,y),(x,y)∈σi+1,−ki,3ℓi+32(x,y),(x,y)∈σi+2,0,otherwise,whereki,jare the constants computed in (I).For any non-zero splines∈S21(Δn), ifsupp(s)⊂σi∪σi+1∪σi+2, then the valuess(vi+1)ands(vi+2)are both non-zero ands(vi+1)s(vi+2)=d(vi+1,ℓi)⋅d(vi+1,ℓi+3)d(vi+2,ℓi)⋅d(vi+2,ℓi+3).Proof(I) Forj=1,…,6, letℓj=ajx+bjy. Expanding the squares in equation (1) and collecting the terms with respect tox2, xy andy2, we obtain the following system of equations inki,j:[ai2ai+12ai+22ai+32aibiai+1bi+1ai+2bi+2ai+3bi+3bi2bi+12bi+22bi+32]︸A⋅[ki,0ki,1ki,2ki,3]=0.Let us examine the order 3 minorA1(removing the first column fromA). Fact 1.3 gives usA1=|ai+1ai+2bi+1bi+2|⋅|ai+2ai+3bi+2bi+3|⋅|ai+1ai+3bi+1bi+3.|Remembering that the vectors〈aj,bj〉are unit and that the angle between the vectors〈aj,bj〉and〈ak,bk〉is equal to the angleθj,kbetween the edgesτjandτk, we getA1=sin⁡(θi+1,i+2)⋅sin⁡(θi+2,i+3)⋅sin⁡(θi+1,i+3).The assumption about the angles implies, in particular, that all three sines are positive. Therefore,Ahas rank 3, and we have established the claim of uniqueness, up to a constant, of a non-zero solution.By linear algebra, the solution is given byki,j=(−1)jAj+1, and the formula in (I) follows after another application of Fact 1.3.(II) Suppose thatsi(x,y)∈S21(Δn)vanishes on all the triangles inΔn, except possibly onσi∪σi+1∪σi+2. Then the smoothness conditions acrossτiandτi+3demand thatsi(x,y)|σi=ki,0ℓi2(x,y)and thatsi(x,y)|σi=−ki,3ℓi+32(x,y)for some constantski,0andki,3. (The reason for the choice of the sign ofki,3will become clear momentarily.)The smoothness condition across the edgeτi+1impliessi(x,y)|σi+1=ki,0ℓi2(x,y)+ki,1ℓi+12(x,y)for some constantki,1. On the other hand, the smoothness condition acrossτi+2implies thatsi(x,y)|σi+1=−ki,3ℓi+32(x,y)−ki,2ℓi+22(x,y)for a constantki,2.Thus, the constantski,0,…,ki,3must satisfy equation (1), and the claims in (II) follow from what we established in (I).(III) Any non-zero spline s satisfying the assumptions must be a (non-zero) constant multiple of the splinesiconstructed in (II), so it suffices to establish the claim forsi.This will be a direct calculation. We remind the reader that the normal vectors toℓiare unit, so in particular,ℓi(vj)is the distanced(vj,ℓi)from the pointvjto the lineℓi(x,y)=0. By‖vj‖we denote the distance ofvjfromv⁎=(0,0). We havesi(vi+1)=(∏1≤p<q≤3sin⁡θi+p,i+q)ℓi2(vi+1)=(∏1≤p<q≤3sin⁡θi+p,i+q)‖vi+1‖2sin2⁡θi,i+1and similarlysi(vi+2)=(∏0≤p<q≤2sin⁡θi+p,i+q)‖vi+2‖2sin2⁡θi+2,i+3.It is clear that, by the assumption on the angles,sidoes not vanish atvi+1andvi+2.For the ratio of the values, after canceling terms and keeping in mind thatℓi+3(vi+1)andℓi+3(vi+2)have the same sign, we getsi(vi+1)si(vi+2)=‖vi+1‖2sin⁡θi,i+1sin⁡θi+1,i+3‖vi+2‖2sin⁡θi,i+2θi+2,i+3=d(vi+1,ℓi)⋅d(vi+1,ℓi+3)d(vi+2,ℓi)⋅d(vi+2,ℓi+3).□Now we show that it is possible to label the boundary vertices in such a way that, for alli∈{1,…,n−3}, the anglesθi,i+2andθi+1,i+3are both acute.Lemma 1.5LetΔnbe a cell,n≥5.(I)If{vi|i=1,…,n}is an arbitrary counterclockwise sequential labeling of boundary vertices, then there are at most two non-acute angles. Moreover, if there are two anglesθi,i+2andθj,j+2that are not acute, then i and j must be consecutive indices.There is a counterclockwise sequential labeling{vi|i=1,…,n}of the boundary vertices such that the anglesθi,i+2are acute for alli∈{1,…,n−2}.Proof(I) Let i be an index such thatθi,i+2≥π. Renumbering the edges if necessary, we may assume thati=n−1, i.e.,θn−1,1≥π. Then for alli∈{1,…,n−3}, the anglesθi,i+2are acute, because they are contained in the angle betweenτ1andτn−1(measured counterclockwise). This leaves us with two angles:θn,2andθn−2,n; at most one of these angles can be greater than or equal to π sinceθn,2+θ2,n−2+θn−2,n=2πandθ2,n−2>0(the latter is where the assumptionn≥5is used).(II) If all the anglesθi,i+2are acute, any sequential labeling will work. Ifθi,i+2≥πfor some i, then we use the labeling described in (I) as a starting point. With vertices labeled as described in (I), we already have thatθi,i+2<πfori=1,…,n−3. To finish the proof, we also need to ensure thatθn−2,n<π.Ifθn−2,n<π, then there is nothing to do. Otherwise,θn,2<π, and we can shift the indices by 1, so that vertex with the index n becomes the vertex with the index 1. After the shift, we have thatθi,i+2<πfor alli=1,…,n−2, as needed.  □We are now ready to prove the main result of this section.Proof of Proposition 1.1Label the boundary vertices ofΔnas described in Lemma 1.5(II). For that labeling, we have that the anglesθi,i+2andθi+1,i+3are both acute fori={1,…,n−3}. Using Lemma 1.4 for eachi=1,…,n−3, we get a family{si|i=1,…,n−3}satisfying the properties (1) and (2) of the Proposition.It remains to establish (3). Theorem 9.3 in Lai and Schumaker (2007) gives that the dimension ofS21(Δn)isn+3(note thatn≥5guarantees that the number of slopes of the interior edges at the interior vertex is at least 3). Thus, we only need to show the linear independence of the setB.Suppose thatq(x,y)+∑i=1n−3disi(x,y)=0for some quadratic polynomial q and constantsdi. Since allsi,i=1,…,n−3, vanish onσn, we have thatq=0. The rest follows by an inductive argument oni=1,…,n−3:0=∑i=1n−3disi(v2)=d1s1(v2), sod1=0;0=∑i=2n−3disi(v3)=d2s2(v3), sod2=0; and so on.  □Remark 1.6There are interesting connections between the basic splines described in this paper and the locally linearly independent basis splines studied in Davydov (1998) and Davydov and Schumaker (2000). Namely, the locally linearly independent bases for cells that appear in Davydov and Schumaker (2000, Section 4) satisfy the property in Proposition 1.1(1). By Lemma 1.4, the locally linearly independent basis splines supported on three triangles in Davydov and Schumaker (2000) are, up to a constant multiple, the splines described in Lemma 1.4(II).The paper Davydov (1998) presents locally linearly independent bases for the splines of degree at least 5. We are grateful to the referee for pointing out that, due to the isomorphism between the Bernstein–Bezier nets ofC1splines of degree at least 5 in the 2-disk around an interior vertex andC1quadratic splines on a cell, the description of the basis splines of types 1, 5, 6, and 8 in Davydov (1998) applies toC1quadratic splines on a cell as well.The requirement that the anglesθi,i+2,i=1,…,n−2, be acute is a little stronger than the usual assumption that the edgesτiandτi+2not lie on the same line. We chose to use the stronger property because it allows us to consider fewer cases later, for instance in the proof of Lemma 2.7 (and we can always find a labeling of the vertices with this property by Lemma 1.5).For the remainder of the paper, we focus on the hexagonal cellsΔ:=Δ6. Given verticesviandvjof Δ, we denote the line throughviandvjby(vivj). The symbolℓiwill continue to denote a linear form such thatℓi(x,y)=0is an equation of the line(v⁎vi); and, for1≤i≠j≤6, the symbolℓi,jwill denote a linear form that vanishes on(vivj). The symbolsd(vk,ℓi)andd(vk,ℓi,j)will denote the (oriented) distance from the vertexvkto the lineℓi=0andℓi,j=0, respectively.Given four pointsp1,…,p4on a line, some of which can be points at infinity, recall that the cross-ratio[p1,p2,p3,p4]is defined as follows. Fix a coordinate system on the line and find the coordinatexiof the pointpi. Then[p1,p2,p3,p4]:=(x3−x1)(x4−x2)(x4−x1)(x3−x2).We use the conventions of projective geometry when dealing with ∞. It is clear that the cross-ratio does not depend on the choice of the coordinate system. Below, we will think of the quantity(xi−xj)as the oriented distance from the pointpjto the pointpiand write the cross-ratio as|p1p3|⋅|p2p4||p1p4|⋅|p2p3|.We use the following condition, illustrated in Fig. 1, to characterize the failure of the interpolation property.Definition 2.1Let Δ be a hexagonal cell with boundary verticesv1,…,v6, sequentially labeled in the counterclockwise direction. Fix an indexi=1,…,6. Letpiandpi+3be the points of intersection of the line(vi+1vi+2)with the line containing the interior edgeτi, andτi+3, respectively. Letqi,i+3andqi−1,i−2be the points of intersection of(vi+1vi+2)with the lines(vivi+3)and(vi−1vi−2). (If any of the lines are parallel, then the point of intersection is taken to be the point at infinity.)We say that Δ satisfies the cross-ratio condition on(vi+1vi+2)if the following two cross ratios are equal:[vi+1,vi+2,pi+3,qi,i+3]=[vi+2,vi+1,pi,qi−1,i−2].Theorem 2.2The following are equivalent for a hexagonal cell Δ:1.Δ fails the interpolation property;The boundary vertices of Δ lie on a conic section; no four of the boundary vertices are collinear; and the cross-ratio conditions hold on(vi+1vi+2)fori=1,2,3.Here is the plan for the proof. First we establish that if Δ does not have the interpolation property, then the boundary vertices of Δ must lie on a conic (this follows from a classical result, for example, Fact 2.3 below); and no four points are collinear (Lemma 2.4). After that, we obtain the needed characterization of the failure of the interpolation property for hexagonal cells, the boundary vertices of which lie on a conic with no four boundary vertices collinear.Fact 2.3(See Proposition 1 ofEisenbud et al. (1996).) Let d be the degree of a plane curve and letV={v1,…,vn}⊂Pbe any collection ofn≤2d+2distinct points. The points of V fail to impose independent conditions on curves of degree d if and only if eitherd+2of the points of V are collinear orn=2d+2and V is contained in a conic.Thus, six points will fail to impose independent conditions on quadratic polynomials if and only if the six points lie on a conic (if any 4 points are collinear, then the set of 6 points will lie on a conic). If Δ fails the interpolation property, then, in particular, the boundary vertices do not impose independent conditions on quadratic polynomials; so the boundary vertices must lie on a conic. The next step is to establish that if the interpolation property fails forS21(Δ), then no four points can be collinear.Lemma 2.4If Δ does not have the interpolation property for its boundary vertices, then no four of the boundary points are collinear.The proof of the lemma is in Section 3. The lemma allows us to focus on the hexagonal cells such that the boundary vertices lie on a conic and no 4 vertices are collinear. Let us call such cells conic cells. The following proposition characterizes the failure of the interpolation property first in terms of linear algebra, and then the linear algebra condition is translated into the geometric characterization in terms of cross-ratios.Let(xi,yi),i=1,…,6, be the coordinates of the boundary verticesv1,…,v6; we assume that the boundary vertices are labeled so that the anglesθi,i+2between the corresponding interior edges are acute fori=1,…,4. LetB={1,x,y,x2,xy,y2,s1,s2,s3}be the basis forS21(Δ)provided by Proposition 1.1. Writing an interpolation problem{s(vi)=zi|i=1,…,6}with respect to that basis, we obtain a system of linear equations with the matrix(⁎⁎)M=[QS1S2S3],whereQ:=[1x1y1x12x1y1y121x2y2x22x2y2y22⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮1x6y6x62x6y6y62],Si:=[si(v1)si(v2)⋮si(v6)],i=1,2,3.It is clear that the cell Δ fails the interpolation property wheneverrank(M)<6. In the following proposition, we translate this condition into geometric terms.Proposition 2.5Let Δ be a conic cell and letBbe the basis forS21(Δ)constructed inProposition 1.1. Then the following are equivalent:1.Δ does not have the interpolation property;the rank of the matrixMin(⁎⁎)is 5;the values of each of the basic splinessi,i=1,2,3, at the boundary vertices can be interpolated by a quadratic polynomial;the cross-ratio conditions hold on(vi+1vi+2)fori=1,2,3.Proof(1)⇔(2). If Δ does not have the interpolation property, then the matrixMcannot have the full rank. On the other hand, the submatrixQhas rank 5 since Δ is a conic cell (indeed, by Fact 2.3, five of the six vertices do impose independent conditions on the quadratic polynomials). Thus,rank(M)=5. The converse is trivial.(2)⇔(3). We will use the following easy linear algebra observation:Fact 2.6Let A be ann×nmatrix with rankn−1and letb1,…,bkbe vectors inRn. Thenb1,…,bk∈Col(A)if and only if the matrix[Ab1⋯bk]has rankn−1.It follows thatrank(M)=5if and only if each of the vectorsS1,S2,S3is in the span of the column space ofQ. The latter means precisely that for each basic splinesithere is a quadratic polynomialqisuch thatsi(vj)=qi(vj)for allj=1,…,6.(3)⇔(4). This follows from Lemma 2.7, the proof of which is in Section 3.Lemma 2.7Let Δ be a conic cell with boundary verticesv1,…,v6. Then:(I)For eachi=1,2,3, there is a numberRisuch that for any quadratic polynomial q that vanishes on all the boundary vertices except forvi+1andvi+2, the ratioq(vi+1)/q(vi+2)is equal toRi.The values of the basic splinesion boundary vertices of Δ can be interpolated by a quadratic polynomial if and only ifsi(vi+1)/si(vi+2)=Ri.si(vi+1)/si(vi+2)=Riif and only if the cross-ratio condition holds on(vi+1vi+2).The needed equivalence(3)⇔(4)follows from statements (II) and (III) above, for eachi=1,2,3.  □Proving Theorem 2.2 now amounts to collecting what we have already proved.Proof of Theorem 2.2(1)⇒(2)If Δ fails the interpolation property, then Δ must be a conic cell by Fact 2.3 and Lemma 2.4 (i.e., the first two conditions in (2) hold). By Proposition 2.5, the three cross-ratios must be equal.(2)⇒(1)is immediate from(4)⇒(1)in Proposition 2.5.  □For a class of hexagonal cells, the geometric condition takes a particularly clear form. Call a hexagonal cell concordant if all six interior edges lie on three lines. For such cells, we have a particularly easy to state characterization of the interpolation property.Corollary 2.8Let Δ be a concordant hexagonal cell. Then the following are equivalent:1.Δ fails the interpolation property;fori=1,2,3the lines(vivi+3),(vi+1vi+2), and(vi−1,vi−2)are concurrent;there is a projective transformation moving Δ to a regular hexagonal cell.We give the proof of the corollary in Section 4. Using the corollary, it is easy to construct concordant hexagonal cells with an unconfinable interior vertex that are not affine-equivalent to a regular cell. One such example is the cell with boundary vertices(±6,−3),(±10,5),(0,15), and(0,−5); the interior vertex at the origin. The failure of the interpolation property can be confirmed using Alfeld's MDS software. The software can be found at www.math.utah.edu/~pa/MDS; we include a snapshot in the left panel of Fig. 2.We finish this section of the paper with the following comment.Remark 2.9We note that there are non-concordant hexagonal cells that fail the interpolation property (and so their interior vertices are unconfinable). Let us describe a family of such cells. The interior vertex is at the origin, and the boundary vertices are all on the unit circle. Letv1=(1,0)and chooseτ2so thatθ1,2=αfor someα∈(0,π/3]. The remaining edges are chosen so thatθi,i+2=2π/3for alli=1,…,4(see the right panel of Fig. 2).It is easy to check that each such cell will fail the interpolation property. Whenα=π/3, we get the regular hexagonal cell (which is, of course, concordant); but ifα<π/3, then the cells are not concordant.It would be interesting to obtain a complete description of all the hexagonal cells that do not have the interpolation property.Proof of Lemma 2.4Suppose at least four boundary vertices are collinear; we show that Δ does have the interpolation property. Since Δ is an interior cell, the boundary vertices are not all collinear. Thus we have two cases: exactly 4 points are collinear or 5 points are collinear. The arguments for the two cases use different ideas, both of which will be also used later.Case 1, four collinear vertices. Suppose that exactly four of the boundary vertices lie on a line L. In this case, the boundary vertices impose 5 independent conditions on the space of quadratic functions (we can select 5 boundary points no 4 of which are collinear and apply Fact 2.3). We are trying to establish that the vertices impose 6 independent conditions onS21(Δ); thus, it remains to find a spline whose values at the boundary vertices are not interpolated by any quadratic function.Letv1,…,v6be a counterclockwise sequential labeling of the boundary vertices; let i be an index such that1.exactly one of the verticesvi+1andvi+2is on L;the anglesθi,i+2andθi+1,i+3are both acute.Case 2, five collinear vertices. Suppose that 5 of the pointsv1,…,v6are collinear. This case is a little more difficult since the set of boundary vertices imposes only 4 independent conditions on the quadratic polynomials. Label the boundary vertices in such a way that the vertexv1is not on the line L containing five other vertices. The approach will be to construct directly the splinesfi∈S21(Δ),i=1,…,6, so that(fi(v1),…fi(v6))=eifor all i. The functionf1is easy: we can take it to be the (suitably normalized) linear form that defines L. We next constructf2andf6, and then the remainingfi's.Letq2be the product of linear forms that vanish on(v1v3)and(v1v6)normalized so thatq2(v2)=1. The valuesq2(v4)andq2(v5)are non-zero. Luckily, as we show below,(⁎)q2(v4)q2(v5)=s3(v4)s3(v5),wheres3is spline constructed in Lemma 1.4. Thenf2:=q2−q2(v4)s3(v4)s3is as needed.To establish (⁎), we use the geometric meaning of the values of bothq2ands3at the verticesv4andv5. Fors3, this is given by Lemma 1.4(III):s3(v4)s3(v5)=d(v4,ℓ3)d(v5,ℓ3)⋅d(v4,ℓ6)d(v5,ℓ6).Using similar triangles (see Fig. 3), the last expression can be rewritten as follows:d(v4,ℓ3)d(v5,ℓ3)⋅d(v4,ℓ6)d(v5,ℓ6)=|v4v3||v5v3|⋅|v4v6||v5v6|.Similarly,q2(v4)q2(v5)=d(v4,(v1v3))d(v5,(v1v3))⋅d(v4,(v1v6))d(v5,(v1v6))=|v4v3||v5v3|⋅|v4v6||v5v6|,and the latter is equal tos3(v4)/s3(v5), as claimed.The construction off6is analogous: takeq6to be the product of linear forms that vanish on(v1v2)and(v1v5)normalized so thatq6(v6)=1. Letf6:=q6−q6(v3)s2(v3)s2. An argument similar to the one above shows thatf6is as needed.It remains to construct{fj|j=3,4,5}. Forj∈{3,4,5}, letqjbe the product of linear forms that vanish on(v1vk)and(v1vl), wherek≠l∈{3,4,5}∖{j}, normalized so thatqj(vj)=1. Thenfj=qj−qj(v2)f2−qj(v6)f6is as required.  □Now we turn to the proof of Lemma 2.7.Proof of Lemma 2.7(I) We prove a more general statement. Suppose thatp1,…,p6are points on a conic C, listed in an arbitrary way, but such that no 4 points are collinear. Ifq1,q2are quadratic functions that vanish onp1,…,p4, but neither vanishes onp5, then alsoq1(p6)≠0,q2(p6)≠0,andq1(p5)q1(p6)=q2(p5)q2(p6).Indeed, by Fact 2.3, there is a unique conic containing the five pointsp1,…,p4,p6; namely, the conic C. Thusqi(p6)=0would have impliedqi(p5)=0fori=1,2. To establish the equality of the ratios, letq˜:=q1−(q1(p6)/q2(p6))q2. Sinceq˜vanishes onp1,…,p4,p6, we must haveq˜(v5)=0. Rewriting the last equality, we get the equality of the ratios claimed in (I).Before proceeding with the proof of the lemma, let us make the following observation.Remark 3.1Ifp1,…,p6are points on a conic, andq1,q2are quadratic polynomials that vanish on four of the six points, it certainly need not be the case thatq1is a constant multiple ofq2. For example, for the six points(±1,0),(0,±1), and(±1,±1), the functions xy,(x+y−1)(x+y+1), and(x−y−1)(x−y+1)all vanish on(±1,0)and(0,±1)and are not a constant multiple of each other. What we prove in (I), and what can be readily verified in the example, is that the ratio of values at the remaining two points must be the same.(II) We prove(⇐). Supposesi(vi+1)/si(vi+2)=Ri, whereRiis a constant such that for some (equivalently, any) quadratic polynomial q that vanishes on all the boundary vertices exceptvi+1andvi+2we haveRi=q(vi+1)/q(vi+2). But then the appropriate multiple of q interpolates the values ofsion all the boundary vertices. The converse is similarly easy.(III) The idea can be summarized as follows. We choose a specific quadratic functionqithat vanishes on all the boundary vertices except onvi+1andvi+2. The ratiossi(vi+1)/si(vi+2)andqi(vi+1)/qi(vi+2)can be interpreted as the ratios of (oriented) distances between certain points on the line containing the edgevi+1vi+2. Finally, the equality of these ratios of oriented distances can be rewritten as the equality of cross-ratios.Similarity of triangles argument (see the left panel in Fig. 4) givesd(vi+1,ℓi)d(vi+2,ℓi)=|vi+1pi||vi+2pi|andd(vi+1,ℓi+3)d(vi+2,ℓi+3)=|vi+1pi+3||vi+2pi+3|.Note that neitherpinorpi+3is between the pointsvi+1andvi+2on(vi+1vi+2); thus the oriented distances in the above formulas have the same sign. Finally, by Lemma 1.4(III),si(vi+1)si(vi+2)=d(vi+1,ℓi)⋅d(vi+1,ℓi+3)d(vi+2,ℓi)⋅d(vi+2,ℓi+3)=|vi+1pi‖vi+1pi+3||vi+2pi‖vi+2pi+3|.Letqi=ℓi,i+3⋅ℓi−1,i−2, whereℓj,kis a linear form defining the line throughvjandvk, normalized so thatℓj,k(p)gives the (oriented) distance from p to the line. Using similarity of triangles (right panel of Fig. 4), we get (keeping in mind that all the distances are oriented):d(vi+1,ℓi,i+3)d(vi+2,ℓi,i+3)=|vi+1qi,i+3||vi+2qi,i+3|andd(vi+1,ℓi−1,i−2)d(vi+2,ℓi−1,i−2)=|vi+1qi−1,i−2||vi+2qi−1,i−2|.The desired equality follows.We now rewrite the equalitysi(vi+1)/si(vi+2)=Rias the equality of cross-ratios, completing the argument. Indeed,si(vi+1)/si(vi+2)=Riholds if and only if|vi+1pi‖vi+1pi+3||vi+2pi‖vi+2pi+3|=|vi+1qi,i+3‖vi+1qi−1,i−2||vi+2qi,i+3‖vi+2qi−1,i−2|.Rearranging the terms, we get|vi+1pi+3‖vi+2qi,i+3||vi+1qi,i+3‖vi+2pi+3|=|vi+2pi‖vi+1qi−1,i−2||vi+1pi‖vi+2qi−1,i−2|It remains to note that the right-hand side is[vi+1,vi+2,pi+3,qi,i+3]and the left-hand side is the cross-ratio[vi+2,vi+1,pi,qi−1,i−2].  □Remark 3.2We note that the choice of the linear forms that vanish on the four points is not unique. The choice of the formsℓi,i+3andℓi−1,i−2(rather than, say,ℓi,i−2andℓi−1,i+3) is motivated by the calculations in the following section.We prove a proposition that gives more information; the equivalence(1)⇔(3)gives the Corollary. Throughout, we are working in the projective plane. Before stating the proposition, we give an example that will motivate one of the conditions equivalent to the failure of the interpolation property.Example 4.1The regular hexagonal cellΔˆis the cell with the interior vertexu⁎=[0:0:1]and the boundary verticesui=[cos⁡(π3i):sin⁡(π3i):1]fork=1,…,6. In the affine plane, the three lines(uiui+3),(ui+1ui+2), and(ui−1ui−2)are parallel for eachi=1,2,3. This is witnessed by the fact that, in the projective plane, the lines are concurrent with the common point of intersectionsi=[cos⁡(π3i):sin⁡(π3i):0]. As we show below, the property that the lines are concurrent characterizes the failure of the interpolation property in concordant cells.Proposition 4.2Let Δ be a concordant hexagonal cell. Then the following are equivalent:1.Δ fails the interpolation property;Δ is a conic cell and the lines(vivi+3),(vi+1vi+2), and(vi−1vi−2)are concurrent for eachi=1,2,3;there is a projective transformation that maps Δ to a regular hexagonal cell.ProofWe will prove(1)⇔(2)and(2)⇔(3).(1)⇔(2). By Theorem 2.2, a concordant hexagonal cell Δ fails the interpolation property if and only if Δ is a conic cell and the cross-ratio condition holds on(vi+1vi+2)fori=1,2,3. We show that, for concordant cells, the cross-ratio condition on(vi+1vi+2)is equivalent to the condition that the lines(vivi+3),(vi+1vi+2)and(vi−1vi−2)are concurrent.Indeed, in a concordant cell, the equationsℓi=0,ℓi+3=0andℓi,i+3=0define the same line. Thus, the intersection points of those lines with(vi+1vi+2)are the same:pi=pi+3=qi,i+3. So[vi+1,vi+2,pi+3,qi,i+3]=[vi+2,vi+1,pi,qi−1,i−2]holds if and only if[vi+1,vi+2,pi,pi]=[vi+2,vi+1,pi,qi−1,i−2]Since[vi+1,vi+2,pi,pi]=1, the last equality holds if and only ifpi=qi−1,i−2. The latter means that the line(vi−1vi−2)intersects(vi+1vi+2)at the same point as(vivi+3).(2)⇐(3)is clear because projective transformations preserve conic sections and concurrent lines remain concurrent. The vertices of the regular hexagon described in Example 4.1 are on the unit circle and each set of lines{(uiui+3),(ui+1ui+2),(ui−1ui−2)},i=1,2,3, is concurrent.(2)⇒(3)requires some work. The main idea is this: we show that a concordant cell satisfying (2) is completely determined by a certain set of four points, and these four points form a projective frame. It is well known that for any pair of projective frames there is a projective transformation taking one frame to another (and thus taking the given cell to a regular hexagonal cell).Lemma 4.3Let Δ be a cell satisfying (2). Fori=1,2,3, lettibe the common point of intersection of the lines(vivi+3),(vi+1vi+2), and(vi−1vi−2). All the vertices of Δ can be constructed, with straightedge, from the pointst1,t3,v5, andv⁎.ProofWe simply describe the construction; the reader may follow along using Fig. 5. Let the pointst1,t3,v5, andv⁎be given. Thenv6is the point of intersection of(t1v5)and(t3v⁎); andv4is the point of intersection of(t1v⁎)and(t3v5). The pointt2is the point of intersection of the lines(t1t3)and(v⁎v5)(here, we are using the assumption that the cell Δ is conic; it follows from Pascal's hexagon theorem that the pointst1,t2, andt3are collinear). The line(t2v6)intersects(t1v⁎)at the vertexv1, and(t2v4)intersects(t3v⁎)atv3. The final vertexv2is the intersection of(t1v3)and(t3v1).  □It is routine to check that for a cell Δ satisfying (2) the set of points{t1,t3,v5,v⁎}forms a projective frame (no three points in the set are collinear). Thus, there is a projective transformation sending{t1,t3,v5,v⁎}to the frame{s1,s3,u5,u⁎}for the regular hexagonal cell described in Example 4.1. It follows from the above Lemma that the projective transformation does map Δ to the regular cellΔˆ.  □
