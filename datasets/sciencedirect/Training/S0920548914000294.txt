How do we define the “general purpose”?

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Interoperability standard is a key to the global personal health services industry.Medical device regulation policy is behind the development of interoperability.We analyze the pros and cons of using intended purpose for regulation.We analyze the ‘over-regulation’ and ‘no-regulation’ scenarios.We conclude that a balanced regulation policy framework is immediately needed.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The intended purpose of a device is a key reference when regulators decide whether or not to regulate it as a medical device. However, when coming into consumer health domain, it is sometimes difficult to decide whether a device (or system) has a general purpose or not. The authors discussed the regulatory policy around health device connectivity, operating system and software market, and proposed to regulate them with enough granularity.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Developing and implementing a set of personal health device interoperability standards is a mandatory pre-requisite to cultivate a healthy global industry ecosystem. The outcomes of such standardization efforts are often used as technical components of software OS which are further embedded by eHealth or mHealth systems, thus subjecting them to medical device regulation. However, current regulation systems do not include OS and online software market into the scope of medical device regulation, which results in a regulatory gap between the evolvement of personal health technologies and the expected quality/safety of personal health device products. This issue needs to be solved as soon as possible to ensure a healthy development of personal health industry. The promising part is: several regulatory bodies have already begun to explore the regulatory gaps and to make plans on how to fix them. During March 19–21, 2013, USA Energy & Commerce Committee held three hearings to discuss the regulatory policy about applying ICT technologies in healthcare domain. The participants, who are the representatives of industry stakeholders, collectively require FDA to clarify the rules for mobile medical apps and to establish a balanced regulatory framework for mHealth services and applications that protects patient safety and privacy while facilitating continued progress in applying mobile innovation to advancing the nation's health and wellness. As a sequence of many similar ongoing discussions and consultations like this one, Section 618 of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) Workgroup called upon the Department of the Health and Human Services (HHS) through the FDA, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to develop “a proposed strategy and recommendations on an appropriate, risk-based regulatory framework pertaining to health information technology, including mobile medical applications” [13]. Although this is still an ongoing work, we have seen some initial consensus built based on an active collaboration and dialog in the FDASIA Workgroup. In September, 2013, ONC published the report from FDASIA [14] which contains the following recommendation — “FDA could use the current regulatory framework to clarify ambiguities.” And under that recommendation, the Workgroup specifically states that FDA should “expedite guidance on HIT software, mobile medical applications (MMA) and related matters”.So far, none of the above initiatives have specifically touched the issues discussed above, but they are along the same direction of what we are proposing here. As a group of SDO contributors, we do expect a positive outcome of these initiatives and we hope that they could also take the above issues into consideration in their future works.
