@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The widespread use of the Internet has significantly changed the behavior of homebuyers. Using online real estate agents, homebuyers can rapidly find some modern houses that meet their needs; however, most current online housing systems provide limit features. In particular, existing systems fail to consider homebuyers’ housing goals and risk attitudes. To increase effectiveness, online real estate agents should provide an efficient matching mechanism, personalized service and house ranking with the aim of increasing both buyers’ satisfaction and deal rate. An efficient online real estate agent should provide an easy way for homebuyers to find (rank) a suitable house (alternatives) with consideration of their different housing philosophies and risk attitudes. In order to comprehend these ambiguous housing goals and risk attitudes, it is also indispensable to determine a satisfaction level for each fuzzy goal and constraint.In this study, we propose fuzzy goal programming with an S-shaped utility function as a decision aid to help homebuyers in choosing their preferred house via the Internet in an easy way. With the use of a decision aid, homebuyers can specify their housing goals and constraints with different priority levels and thresholds as a matching mechanism for a fuzzy search, while the matching mechanism can be translated into a standard query language for a regular relational database. Moreover, a laboratory experiment is conducted on a real case to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed method provides better customer satisfaction than manual systems in housing selection service.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many buyers’ experiences of using search tools through the Internet to find an appropriate house may not reduce their search time (D’Urso, 2002; Leonard, Ken, & Randy, 2003). This is due to the difficulty of evaluating the multitude of factors, such as emotional priorities, financial situations and arbitrary preferences at the same time. For the sake of easy illustration, we consider the following example throughout this paper. A young couple, Alice and John, decides to buy a house with emphasized consideration of children’s education. Alice would like to buy a house near the best high school in the city. In order to gather as much housing information as possible within the shortest time, Alice turns to the Internet. By using “real estate” as a keyword, she receives more than one million related links from Google. However, these real estate websites can only screen out houses that exactly match specific constraints (e.g., city/state, price range and number of bedrooms) given by Alice. Alice is disappointed with the result because she cannot input appropriate criteria into the system to meet her needs, such as a house of “about” 250 square meters or “not too far” from her workplace. She scrutinizes the housing information listed on the Internet and eliminates the unqualified houses by herself. Since there are a huge number of alternatives, it is difficult for Alice to evaluate and rank them, and none of the online agents can provide a good ranking service.How can someone become a successful real estate agent? They should provide an efficient and flexible search tool for homebuyers with different ages, housing considerations and risk attitudes. Usually, risk tolerance increases with age when other variables are controlled (Wang & Hanna, 1997). Young buyers, who have less money, may engage in less risk by selecting an apartment. Middle-aged buyers are risk lovers, with more money and more experience. Thus, they may choose bigger houses. With decreasing income, elders who are usually risk averters will choose houses with less risk such as countryside houses.Most online real estate agents, such as Yahoo Real Estate (http://realestate.yahoo.com/) and Realtor.com (http://www.realtor.com/), provide a common search tool with basic constraints for homebuyers to list all houses which exactly match their requirements from the database. In this case, some potential houses with slight deviations from the constraints will be excluded by using the search tool. That is, a good match between buyer and potential house is difficult to reach because everyone has his/her own preferences. With multiple housing goals and different priorities for each individual, comparing similar houses is very complicated work for agents. For example, a homebuyer would like to buy a suburban house with consideration of convenient transportation, beautiful environment and at least two bedrooms. However, so far, there is no online real estate agent providing appropriate tools to apply the functions of multi-goal and multi-criteria searches with fuzzy preferences.We list some important concerns for online agents and homebuyers as follows:(1)There is a lot of fuzzy information on the Internet such as “great quiet neighborhood with excellent schools” or “close to world-class shopping, dining and entertainment at nearby Santana Row and Valley Fair Plaza”. Liu and Zhang (2009) present a fuzzy evaluation method for residential real estate electronic marketing based on network DEA which uses linguistic variables to evaluate the factors. However, thus far, online agents do not provide any appropriate search tool to aid buyers in describing their ambiguous criteria, such as “comfortable” environment and “nice” neighborhood for housing. Moreover, most of this information is considered as extra descriptions of houses and cannot be processed as a standard query search in a database system.Online real estate agents should provide a tool for homebuyers to prioritize housing constraints. Customers also need a flexible method to determine the relative weights between constraints and rank housing alternatives. To increase the probability of finding the most suitable house, real estate agents should provide a better matching mechanism by taking buyers’ preemptive priority preferences into account (Yuan, Lee, Kim, & Kim, 2013).Ford, Rutherford, and Yavas (2005) pointed out that online homebuyers have to evaluate more houses in order to ultimately find a better match. This leads to higher transactional costs. Personalized service is an essential factor in increasing the competitiveness of online real estate agents (Hamilton & Selen, 2004). However, tools of current agents do not provide the necessary personalization for housing evaluation and ranking. In reality, homebuyers need this service very much. Moreover, it is necessary to offer a user-friendly information search system so as to save busy customers’ time.Online real estate agents should provide a tool to match housing alternatives for buyers according to their housing philosophies and risk attitudes. With different risk attitudes, buyers choose different houses according to the future value of a house (Zhang and Yang, 2012). Based on historical prices and utility functions, homebuyers can predict the future value of the house. This is another important function of the tool.To the best of our knowledge, there is no single tool provided by current real estate agents to handle all the above-mentioned problems. Therefore, in this paper, we try to develop a decision support aid to quantify ambiguous search criteria and rank houses for buyers by considering the above factors. Such a system also allows customers to specify housing constraints with thresholds for standard fuzzy queries. All the constraints and fuzzy queries can then be translated into a series of precise queries for a regular relational database. Finally, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decision aid system, a laboratory experiment is conducted on a real case and detailed corresponding analysis is also provided.Bond, Seiler, Seiler, and Blake (2000) stated that the types of online property information provided by most online real estate agents include geographic region, asked price, neighborhood, structural features and a picture of the house. Real-time listings and virtual home tours make real estate websites rich in content and help homebuyers to be better informed throughout the search and purchase process (Kummerow & Lun, 2005). Internet real estate agents, e.g., Yahoo Real Estate, Realtor.com, and Century 21 Real Estate (http://www.century21.com/home.aspx), usually allow homebuyers to specify characteristics of their target house such as the city, location, price range, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. Then, homebuyers can receive a list of suggested houses based on their given constraints.Obviously, these characteristics are important considerations for homebuyers. Because the Internet can increase search intensity, its prescreening capability allows homebuyers to discover and visit more appropriate properties in a short period (Zumpano, Johnson, & Anderson, 2003). However, the current searching functions provided by online real estate agents seem too simple to meet buyers’ goals and preferences. In order to provide sufficient considerations for customers, this study collects important housing attributes from previous studies and interviews 10 house buyers and 10 senior real estate agents in Taiwan. Some duplicate or irrelevant attributes are eliminated and the selected list is depicted in Table 1.In order to elicit important housing attributes for buyers, this study also constructs an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 1980). AHP provides solutions for decision problems in multi-criteria environments (Forman & Gass, 2001). This study constructs an AHP hierarchy of housing selection as shown in Fig. 1. We invite twenty homebuyers to evaluate these housing attributes using an AHP questionnaire which is partially listed in Appendix A. Finally, the overall relative weights of attributes and sub-attributes are obtained, as shown in Table 2. As seen, price is the most important factor. The second important consideration is the lot size. In addition, distance to children’s schools and safety are also important sub-attributes for housing choices.In this paper, the Fuzzy Goal Programming (FGP) method with an S-shaped utility function is adopted to develop a decision support system to help homebuyers search for appropriate houses on the Internet in consideration of their housing risk attitudes and satisfaction levels.The parameters which define the size of the problem are listed as follows:xan n-vector with components x1, x2, …, xnBthe number of achieved fuzzy constraintsxihouse alternatives, i=1, …, nIndex sets:kthe kth goalsithe ith alternativejthe jth attributerthe rth priority level, r=1, 2, …, i−1Problem data:fk(x)the linear function of the kth goalgkthe aspiration level of the kth goallklower limits for the kth goalukupper limits for the kth goalAijthe jth attribute of the ith alternativeμAijutility function of the jth attribute and the ith alternativeμAij(x)the utility function of the decision maker’s satisfaction levelμattribute(AVj)the average satisfaction level for attribute jμat leastthe utility functions of meeting the buyer’s “at least” level constraintsμat mostthe utility functions of meeting the buyer’s “at most” level constraintsμabout Ythe utility functions of meeting the buyer’s “about” level constraintsCrthe binary variable for determining the preemptive priority of the r-th fuzzy constraintwksthe weights attached to the bounded positive deviations pksfor the sth break point in the kth goalpksthe bounded positive deviations from the target value bksfor the sth break point in the kth goalbksthe utility value of the break points in the kth goal’s utility functionSksthe slope of the deviation between bksλkthe additional continuous variable that represents the utility value in the kth goalek+positive deviations from the highest possible value of the utility function for the kth goalek-negative deviations from the highest possible value of the utility function for the kth goalαkthe positive weights attached to the sum of the deviations ofλk-1zkthe linear function of the kth goalμks(zk(x))a membership function of the kth goalβkthe positive weights obtained from AHP attached to each goalThe housing choice, which involves homebuyers’ heterogeneous preferences, is a typical multi-criteria and multi-objective decision-making problem. Buyers usually have different satisfaction levels for various housing criteria, such as the number of bedrooms, quality of environment and convenience of transportation. Furthermore, they often expect some conflicting housing goals, such as minimizing house price while maximizing lot size and location utility. In order to pursue aspirations-maximization, Charnes and Cooper (1961) proposed Goal Programming (GP) to model real world problems. GP is especially useful for multi-criteria and multi-objective decision problems. The mathematical formulation of GP is introduced as follows:(GP)(1)Minimize∑k=1m|fk(x)-gk|Subject tox∈F,(Fis a feasible set).where fk(x) is the function of the kth goal and gkis the aspiration level of the kth goal.In order to resolve the imprecise aspiration level of the Decision maker’s (DM’s) goals, Narasinhan (1980) utilized the fuzzy weights approach to describe linguistic priorities in the utility functions. The conventional form of FGP can be expressed as follows:(FGP)(2)fk(x)≳gk(orfk(x)≲gk)k=1,2,…nSubject tox∈F,(Fis a feasible set)where fk(x)≳(≲gk) indicates the kth fuzzy goal approximately greater or equal to (approximately less or equal to) the aspiration level gk; other variables are defined as in GP.Fuzzy goals and fuzzy constraints can be defined as fuzzy sets in the space of alternatives (Bellman & Zadeh, 1970). This study adopts the fuzzy logic to deal with the linguistic words in fuzzy constraints, such as the safety of the house should be good. For the sake of simplicity, the preference-based utility functions are expressed as follows:(3)μk(fk(x))=1,iffk(x)≥gk,(fk(x)-lk)gk-lk,iflk<fk(x)<gkforfk(x)≳gk,0,iffk(x)≤lk(4)μk(fk(x))=1,iffk(x)≤gk,(uk-fk(x))uk-gk,ifgk<fk(x)<ukforfk(x)≲gk,0,iffk(x)≥ukwhere lkand ukare, respectively, lower and upper limits for the kth goal; fk(x) and gkare defined as in GP.Online housing decision aids should not only consider the priority weight of each goal but also the homebuyers’ fuzzy preferences. However, it is usually not easy to describe housing goals and criteria precisely. Housing decisions are laced with subjective human values that are usually neither crisp nor deterministic. In 2005, Mohanty and Bhasker (2005) proposed a fuzzy approach for solving production classification problems on the Internet. A DM usually searches for the best satisfactory product that fulfills “most” of the attributes rather than all attributes. Therefore, they defined the linguistic quantifier “most” as a key element for vague aspiration as follows:(5)μmost(x)=1x≥0.8(x-0.3)/(0.5)0.3≤x≤0.80x≤0.Other solutions include the weighted additive model, provided by Tiwari, Dharmar, and Rao (1987), and the weighted max–min model, provided by Lin (2004). However, with a preemptive priority setting, unless a particular goal is achieved, other goals should not be considered. The inexperienced setting of weights in the formulation of GP can lead to incorrect results (Tamiz, Jones, & Romero, 1998).Buckles and Petry (1983) developed a fuzzy relational model to incorporate fuzzy information in a relational database. To extend database management systems functions for the expression of flexible queries, Bosc and Pivert (1995) introduced a SQLf language which is a fuzzy extension of standard query language (SQL). Shenoi and Melton (1999) extended Buckles and Petry’s model to incorporate with proximity relations for scalar domains. Yazici and Cibiceli (1999) utilized a multi-dimensional data structure, Multi Level Grid File, to access both crisp and fuzzy data from a fuzzy database. Ma and Yan (2007) presented generic fuzzy queries for a regular relationship database.In order to handle DM’s fuzzy preferences, Fan, Ma, and Zhang (2002) proposed a method to solve multiple attribute decision making problems by considering the fuzzy relations of alternatives. Rasmy, Lee, Abd EI-Wahed, Ragab, and EI-Sherbiny (2002) established a fuzzy expert system based on the DM’s linguistic preferences for multiple objective decision making problems. Cheng, Chan, and Lin (2006) derived a fuzzy inference system as a negotiation agent to search for a mutually acceptable contract in an e-market.Chang (2010) presented an approach to formulate an S-shaped utility function without adding extra binary variables. The utility function describes the risk attitudes of DMs, including risk aversion and risk seeking. With different risk attitudes in gain or loss situations, homebuyers can find ideal houses with consideration of their housing preferences. In order to comprehend ambiguous housing goals and risk attitudes from with conflicting preferences, it is indispensable to determine the satisfaction level for each fuzzy goal and constraint.There are several studies that integrated the AHP and GP (Badri, 2001; Ho, Chang, & Ku, 2013; Ramanathan & Ganesh, 1995; Schniederjans & Garvin, 1997). Ramanathan and Ganesh (1995) derived AHP weights for the qualitative criteria and employing them as coefficients of the decision variables in the objective functions of the GP model in solving energy resource allocation problem. Badri (2001) implemented the AHP weights for the quality control instruments on each alternative as constraints in GP to reflect the preferences for the different instruments. Ho et al. (2013) obtained weights from AHP and implement it upon each corresponding goal using multi-choice goal programming for the location selection problem.With prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), we can find the varying risk attitudes of DMs in different situations. DMs intend to avoid risk in choices involving sure gains and to seek risk in choices involving sure losses. Similarly, homebuyers exhibit more risk aversion in gain situations as a concave function. On the other hand, homebuyers prefer to be risk lovers in loss situations as a convex function. Therefore, in uncertain situations, each homebuyer should have his/her own S-shape utility function to represent at their risk attitudes.The combination of the above mentioned function may lead to a more effective approach with many advantages. Moreover, it can solve some or all of the shortcomings of each individual approach. Therefore, we integrate FGP with an S-shaped utility function as a decision aid to help with Internet housing choices as follows.This study formulates the buyer’s housing preference among alternatives with Eq. (6). There are K goals and each goal has with attributes Aij, (Aij, μAij). The average satisfaction level for attribute j is given as(6)μattribute(AVj)=1K∑i=1KμAij(x)and the utility function of DM μAij(x) is defined as in FGP.This study constructs the aspiration-maximization of the buyer’s housing goals in consideration of their risk attitudes (Eqs. (7)–(11)) which are represented by the S-shaped utility function (Chang, 2010), while the homebuyer’s preferences, such as price, expected lot size and so on, are represented by Eq. (12). There are two housing goals about future value of the house, the maximization of the expected gain and the minimization of the expected loss. With the slope increase/decrease, Eqs. (7)–(11) can formulate these two goals as a concave/convex function with homebuyers’ risk attitudes (risk averter/lover) in different situations. The approach described above leads to the following formulation:(7)Minimizeβk∗(wk1pk1+wk2pk2+wk3pk3+αk(ek++ek-))Subject toλk=[μks(bk2)-μks(bk1)]pk1bk2-bk1+[μks(bk3)-μks(bk2)]pk2bk3-bk2+[μks(bk4)-μks(bk3)]pk3bk4-bk3,(8)λk-ek++ek-=1,(9)zk(x)-pk1-pk2-pk3≤bk1,(10)wk1<wk2<wk3,(11)0≤pk1≤bk2-bk1,0≤pk2≤bk3-bk2,0≤pk3≤bk4-bk3,(12)μAij(x)≥μattribute(AVj)Cr,r=1,2,…m(13)∑r=1mCr≥B,x∈F(Fis a feasible set)where βkare positive weights obtained from AHP attached to each goal. With AHP method, the relative importance (the relative weights) between attributes will be translated as weights βkon each corresponding goal in the FGP. wksare the weights attached to positive deviations, pks(s=1, 2, 3). pksare the positive deviations from the target value bksfor the s th break point in the kth goal.λkis the additional continuous variable that represents the utility value of the S-shaped utility function in Eq. (7). zk(x) is the linear function of the kth goal. x is an n-vector with components x1, x2, …, xn. μks(zk(x)) is a membership function of the kth goal. Cr(r=1, 2, …, m) are binary variables for determining the preemptive priority of the rth fuzzy constraint. In the proposed model, a DM can choose different weights wkson each deviation to determine the priority of deviations pks. The risk attitudes of DMs can be described as risk averse (a concave utility function) and risk seeking (a convex utility function). In this study, we formulate these two housing risk attitudes in gain and loss situations as shown in Figs. 2–7.Figs. 2 and 4 present the concave utility function of a risk averter in gain and loss situations, respectively. As shown in Figs. 2 and 4, the slope decreases from |Sk1|, |Sk2| to |Sk3|. This means that with the increased risk of expected gain/loss zk(x), the average accumulated satisfaction level μks(zk(x)) of the DM decreases. The slope |Si1|>|Si2|>|Si3| indicates that the DM is a risk averter. Figs. 3 and 5 show a convex utility function of a risk lover in gain and loss situations, respectively. As seen in Figs. 3 and 5, the slope increases from |Sk1|, |Sk2| to |Sk3|. This means that with the increased risk of expected gain/loss zk(x), the average accumulated satisfaction level μks(zk(x)) of the DM increases. The slope |Sk1|<|Sk2|<|Sk3| shows that the DM is a risk lover.This study formulates homebuyers’ risk attitudes in gain situations with an S-shaped utility function as shown in Fig. 6. Where the average accumulated satisfaction level μks(zk(x)) is a convex function (risk lover) for 0⩽zk(x)⩽ɛkand is a concave function (risk averter) for zk(x)⩾ɛk. Similarly, the homebuyer’s two risk attitudes in loss situations are formulated with an S-shaped utility function as shown in Fig. 7, where the average accumulated satisfaction level μks(zk(x)) is a concave function (risk averter) for 0⩽zk(x)⩽ɛkand is a convex function (risk lover) for zk(x)⩾ɛk.Sometimes, a homebuyer cannot find a suitable house when too many constraints are requested. For instance, he/she may set many constraints such as distance to a market and distance to the nearest major hospital at the same time. He/she may find no house meeting these criteria due to excessive specificity. In contrast, if a preemptive priority is set for each constraint or the relationship between constraints is determined, the suitable house could be found more easily from their criteria, and the probability of finding a satisfactory house would increase. The preemptive priority structure can be stated as Cr⋙Cr+ meaning that the constraint in the rth evaluation criteria has higher priority than the (r+1)-th evaluation criteria. With Eqs. (12) and (13), a homebuyer can set a preemptive priority for each constraint to obtain the best available housing options. This modified FGP can determine the most appropriate constraints and recommend a suitable ranking list. In contract, for classic FGP methods, setting relationships among each constraint would be almost impossible.Let us consider a simple modified FGP example with preemptive priority to demonstrate the above-mentioned idea. A homebuyer, Alice, sets three constraints in Eqs. (14)–(16) as: (i) the safety should be good at least so and so, (ii) the pollution level should be low at least so and so, and (iii) the view should be good at least so and so, and specifies that only one of these needs should be achieved. The problem can be formulated as the following achievement function.(14)Minimizewk1pk1+wk2pk2+wk3pk3+αk(ek++ek-)Subject toμAij(x)≥μsafety(AVj)C1(15)μAij(x)≥μpollution(AVj)C2(16)μAij(x)≥μview(AVj)C3(17)C1+C2+C3=1where xi(i=1, …, 9) and Cr(r=1, 2, 3) are binary variablesBecauseCr(r=1,2,3)are binary variables, thus, Eq. (17) dictates that only one constraint is fulfilled in Eqs. (14)–(16). Accordingly, Alice can set different preemptive weights for her constraints according to her preferences.In order to implement the fuzzy concept, this study combines FGP and homebuyer’s fuzzy constraints with linguistic quantifiers, such as “at least”, “at most” or “about”. For example, we replace μattribute(AVj) with μatleast(q) in Eq. (18) to meet the homebuyer’s constraints with “at least” Other utility functions of the fuzzy constraints such as “at least Y”, “at most Y” and “about Y” are defined as in the model proposed by Ma and Yan (2007).(18)μatleast(q)=0,ifq≤a,(q-a)Y-a,ifa<q<Y,1,ifq≥Y(19)μatmost(q)=1,(b-q)b-Y,ifY<q<b0,(20)μaboutY(q)=11+q-Yβ2,where larger values of β correspond to a wide curve and a and b are, respectively, lower and upper limits for each fuzzy constraint.DMs can determine the housing constraints with different thresholds for fuzzy queries, and then these fuzzy queries are translated into precise SQL for a regular relational database as follows.(21)SELECT housing alternativeFROM housing tableWHERE Attribute at least/most WITH matching rate(fuzzy query)Fuzzy query Eq. (21) can be substituted by precise query Eq. (22) when implemented in the relational database.(22)WHEREA≥aANDA≤b(precise query)In short, the main contributions of the proposed method are as follows.1.Homebuyers can easily describe and quantify ambiguous housing preferences with fuzzy satisfaction levels. Moreover, online real estate agents can even convert this approach into a utility function.DMs can decide suitable weights for their risk attitudes in different situations. To express the risk attitudes in different situations, they assign different expected gains or losses on individual house alternatives. The proposed approach can transform these risk attitudes into weights for each target and present different housing ranks.DMs can set preemptive priorities for each constraint according to different situations and obtain different housing ranks which are closer to their preferences.The proposed approach can deal with fuzzy searches in related databases on the Internet for buyers. In order to meet their constraints with linguistic quantifiers, this model evaluates the houses by giving preferential weights according to these fuzzy satisfaction levels.The approach involves inputting the homebuyer’s preferences, goals and criteria, and developing a modified FGP model to obtain individual solutions for each objective function as in the following six steps: Step 1: Identify the homebuyer’s housing goals with suitable risk attitude and roughly determine his/her housing criteria. Step 2: Define the homebuyer’s satisfaction level for each housing goal and criterion. This process allows a homebuyer to develop their own utility function for the fuzzy goals and ambiguous criteria. Step 3: Search for possible alternatives in the database on the Internet using linguistic quantifiers such as “at least”, “at most” or “about.” Step 4: Establish the FGP model with an S-shaped utility function, and aggregate all the homebuyer’s fuzzy goals and criteria. Step 5: Solve the FGP model with an S-shaped utility function, which evaluates each alternative according to the homebuyers’ risk attitude and the scoring attribute set by the fuzzy preferences. Step 6: Rank the house alternatives based on obtained scores, with which the customer can finally choose the utility-maximizing house.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Creating an online search tool with a user-friendly interface for house searches is the key success factor for winning consumers’ trust and preference. Nevertheless, current online agents cannot provide powerful search tools to meet homebuyers’ possible conflicting goals and heterogeneous preferences. This study presents an integrated approach to support homebuyers in their online evaluation process. The proposed approach screens available houses according to homebuyers’ risk attitudes in loss or gain situations. In this way, the proposed approach maximizes the sum of satisfaction levels with given weighted goals. Available houses with some important advantages but slight deviations from the search specifications are not retrieved by current systems. This issue can be solved by the proposed decision aid system. Also, DMs can determine the appropriate constraints with different thresholds for fuzzy queries. In order to meet the buyer’s constraints with linguistic quantifiers, this method evaluates available houses by translating the DM’s queries into precise SQL queries.The proposed approach transforms homebuyers’ fuzzy satisfaction levels into a fixed form. Then the ranking results of houses can be created for homebuyers. Personalized ranking is provided by the proposed system. Homebuyers can adjust their fuzzy goals or set different preemptive priorities on each constraint with ease to derive the different ranking lists.
