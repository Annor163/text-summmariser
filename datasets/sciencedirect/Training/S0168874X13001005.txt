@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Based on the couple stress theory and the hybrid stress element method proposed by Pian, a refined 18-DOF triangular hybrid stress element is established. The15βAiry stress functions which satisfy the equilibrium equation in the domain of the element are chosen as the assumed stress interpolation functions, and boundary displacement interpolation functions are chosen as beam function. The characteristics of this element are possessing second-order accuracy and C0 and C1 continuity in the weak form, satisfying convergence condition for the enhanced patch test and does not exhibits extra zero energy modes. Moreover, a refined assumed stress element method is developed to improve the element accuracy. Numerical examples presented show that the proposed model indeed possesses higher accuracy and can pass the enhanced patch test, and can capture the scale effects of microstructure.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the material size scaling down to the order of micro-scales, numerous experiments conducted in the past decades demonstrated strong size effects. For example, Fleck et al. [1] discovered that the scaled shear strength increases by a factor of three as the wire diameter decreases from 170 to 12μm in torsion experiments on copper wires. Similar phenomena were observed in micro-indentation test [2] and micro-bend test [3]. These phenomena are commonly referred to as size or scale effects. The above observations indicate that the classical continuum mechanics may not be valid at the micro-scale, which leads to the theories for microstructures needed to be developed. The couple stress theory is one of the theories for microstructures.A series of research in the couple stress/strain gradient theories have been made. For example, Toupin [4], Koiter [5] and Mindlin [6] proposed couple stress theory; Fleck-Hutchinson [7] proposed couple stress theory containing one material’s characteristic length constants; Yang [8] proposed symmetrical couple stress containing one of the material characteristic length constants.The C1 continuity thin plate elements in the conventional finite element method, such as the 18-DOF and 21-DOF triangular thin plate element functions proposed by Argyris et al. [9] and Bell [10], can satisfy the continuity conditions of displacements and their first derivatives simultaneously. However, node parameters of the element are more than the first derivatives of the displacement, it is difficult in engineering application to satisfy the boundary conditions. In the application of engineering the C1 continuity plate elements using lower order node parameters, mostly based on weak continuity, are only required to satisfy the weak C1 continuity condition. Therefore, new subjects on finite element method in couple stress/strain gradient theory arise: C1 weak continuity element, which requires element function satisfying both weak C0 continuity with second-order accuracy and weak C1 continuity simultaneously. However, it is difficult to satisfy these requirements by the conventional finite element method.Zervos [11] analyzed the scale effect by using C1 continuity fourth-order accuracy 18-DOF triangular plate element function, where each node contains six displacement parameters with higher derivatives. Papanicolopulos and Zervos [12,13] established third-order accuracy 3D hexahedral element function with 64 parameters, where each node contains eight displacement parameters with higher order derivatives. The method can be applied directly to the couple stress/strain gradient theory to establish four-node plane elements, satisfying both C0 and C1 continuities. However, such elements are not suitable to apply in engineering because it is difficult to satisfy the boundary conditions due to higher order derivatives of node parameters. The C1 continuity elements with higher order derivatives of node parameters are rarely applied in engineering. Zervos’s articles are a few literatures on the C1 continuity element which can be searched up to now.New subject is how to establish C1 continuity element by using lower order node parameters. It is well known that the difficulty to establish the C1 continuity thin plate element in traditional continuum mechanics is solved by using weak C1 continuity conditions instead of C1 continuity. However, the weak C1 continuity condition of couple stress/strain gradient finite element requires to satisfy not only weak C1 continuity but also C0 continuity (or weak C0 continuity) with second-order accuracy. Recently Chen et al. proposed several refined nonconforming elements satisfying weak C1 continuity and weak C0 continuity with second-order accuracy, such as the weak C1 continuity 18-DOF plane couple stress triangular element [14], 18-DOF axisymmetric couple stress triangular element [15] and 24-DOF plane couple stress quadrilateral element [16] in which node parameters contain only displacements and their first derivatives. Patch test is widely used to check the convergence of nonconforming elements. Chen and Soh [17,18] proposed the C0–1 patch test(or enhanced patch test) for couple stress/strain gradient elasticity. The test displacement functions for the C0–1 patch test should be quadratic polynomials, i.e.u=a1+a2x+a3y+a4x2+ax5y+a6y2andv=b1+b2x+b3y+b4x2+bx5y+b6y2whereaiandbiare constants. The test functions should satisfy equilibrium equations without body force. Up to now, the elements proposed by Zervos and by Chen et al. are the only one that can pass the enhanced patch test.Based on a modified complementary energy principle, the assumed stress hybrid finite element proposed by Pian [19] can avoid the difficulty of forming the displacement field interpolation functions while using the displacement conforming element under the condition of the continuous field variables and their first-derivative.Several methods for deriving assumed stress fields [20] have been proposed. Pian and Sumihara [21] proposed a new quadrilateral hybrid stress element that is based on the Hellinger–Reissner principle. They defined the assumed stresses in the natural coordinate system. The stresses are in-turn initially defined in the form of complete uncoupled polynomials. Equilibrium conditions are then enforced on them through integral-type equations with geometric perturbation and subsequently degenerated to rational stress terms. Tong [22] proposed displacement hybrid finite element model, and Chen [23,24] proposed generalized hybrid element model and refined hybrid element model by using the H–W variational principle.Sze [25] used orthogonal lower- and higher-order stress modes to construct a hybrid stress element. His approach allows the partition of the element stiffness matrix into a lower- and a higher-order stiffness matrix. When the lower-order stiffness turns out to be identical to the sub-integrated element, the higher-order stiffness matrix plays the role of a stabilization matrix.For displacement element on the couple stress theory, it is hard to choose displacement function under the condition of satisfying both C0 and C1 continuities in the weak form. However, hybrid stress element for the couple stress theory only requires that the element stress interpolation functions satisfied the equilibrium equations and boundary displacement interpolation functions have high enough order.Displacement: {u,v,ux,uy,vx,vy}, whereu,vare displacements alongxandydirections,ux,uy,vx,vyare the first derivatives of the displacement variables.The geometric equations can be written as(1){εx=∂u∂xεy=∂v∂yγs=∂v∂x+∂u∂yχx=∂ω∂x=12(∂2u∂x∂y−∂2v∂x2)χy=∂ω∂y=12(∂2u∂y2−∂2v∂x∂y)whereω=12(∂u∂y−∂v∂x)Strain:{εx,εy,γs,χx,χy}.Stress:{σx,σy,τs,mx,my}.The equilibrium equations and the boundary conditions are derived from the strain energy. The strain energy can be expressed as(2)U=∫V((σxεx+σyεy+τsγs)+(mxχx+myχy))dVSubstituting Eq. (1) into Eq. (2), the strain energy is(3)∫V[σx∂u∂x+σy∂v∂y+τs(∂u∂y+∂v∂x)+mx∂ω∂x+my∂ω∂y]dxdy=∫S[(σxnx+τsny)u+(σyny+τsnx)v+(mxnx+myny)ω]ds−∫V[(∂σx∂x+∂τs∂y)u+(∂σy∂y+∂τs∂x)v+(∂mx∂x+∂my∂y)ω]dxdy=∫S[(σxnx+τsny)u+(σyny+τsnx)v+(mxnx+myny)ω]ds−∫V[(∂σx∂x+∂τs∂y)u+(∂σy∂y+∂τs∂x)v+(∂mx∂x+∂my∂y)12(∂u∂y−∂v∂x)]dxdy=∫S[(σxnx+τsny−12(∂mx∂x+∂my∂y)ny)u+(σyny+τsnx+12(∂mx∂x+∂my∂y)nx)v+(mxnx+myny)ω]ds−∫V[((∂σx∂x+∂τs∂y−12(∂2mx∂x∂y+∂2my∂2y))u+(∂σy∂y+∂τs∂x+12(∂2mx∂x2+∂2my∂x∂y))v]dxdyThe boundary forces are(4)T={TmxTmyTω}=[σxnx+τsny−12(∂mx∂x+∂my∂y)nyσyny+τsnx+12(∂mx∂x+∂my∂y)nxmxnx+myny]The equilibrium equations are (no body forces)(5){∂σx∂x+∂τs∂y−12(∂2mx∂x∂y+∂2my∂2y)=0∂σy∂y+∂τs∂x+12(∂2mx∂x2+∂2my∂x∂y)=0Constitutive equations:(6)σ=[σxσyτsmxmy]T=Dεwhere(7)D=[DaDc]andDa=[D1μD11−μμD11−μD1G],Dc=[4l2G4l2G]whereσx,σy,τsare normal and shear stresses in continuum mechanics,mx,myare bending momentums in micro-scale, and l is the material characteristic length constant in the micro-scale, andE,μare constants of elasticity, whileD1=E(1−μ)/((1+μ)(1−2μ)),G=E/(2(1+μ)).Substituting geometric Eq. (1) and stress–strain relation equation (6) into Eq. (5), the couple stress equilibrium equation in terms of displacements (no body forces) can be obtained(8){E(1+μ)(1−2μ)((1−μ)∂2u∂x2+(1−2μ)2∂2u∂y2+12∂2v∂x∂y)−l2G(∂4u∂x2∂y2−∂4v∂x3∂y+∂4u∂y4−∂4v∂x∂y3)=0E(1+μ)(1−2μ)((1−2μ)2∂2v∂x2+(1−μ)∂2v∂y2+12∂2u∂x∂y)+l2G(∂4u∂x3∂y−∂4v∂x4+∂4u∂x∂y3−∂4v∂x2∂y2)=0In C0–1 patch test, the test function should satisfy the equilibrium Eq. (8) in terms of displacements.The function of variational principle with relaxed continuity condition for nonconforming element can be written as(9)πe=∫Ω(12σaTDa−1σa+12σcTDc−1σc)dV−∫∂ΩTTu¯dswhereσaandσcare the conventional stress vector and couple stress vector,u¯=[u˜v˜ω˜]TandTare the vectors of the displacement and the prescribed force on the boundary respectively, andu˜,v˜are displacements,ω˜is the rotation on the boundary.For the formulation for hybrid stress element, the stressσ=[σx,σy,τs,mx,my]Tcan be assumed in terms of undetermined stress coefficients β as follows(10)σa=[σx,σy,τs]T=P1βaσc=[mx,my]T=P2βcwhere the terms of the matrixP1,P2are polynomial interpolation functions. The parameters of element inβ=[βaTβcT]Tare unlimited. The assumed stress fieldσaandσcshould satisfy the equilibrium Eq. (5).The boundary forceTcan be expressed as follows:(11)T=[TmxTmyTω]T=RσwhereRis the combination of direction cosine for the boundary normal.The internal strain energy can be express as(12)U=12∫Ω(σaTDa−1σa+σcTDc−1σc)dVorU=12βaTH1βa+12βcTH2βcwhere(13)H=H1+H2,H1=∫ΩeP1TDa−1P1dv,H2=∫ΩeP2TDc−1P2dvand,His the symmetric positive definite matrix.The prescribed displacementu¯on the boundary is written as(14)u¯=LqwhereLare interpolation functions,qare node displacements parameters.By using Eqs. (9) and (12), the total complementary energy is written as(15)πe=12βaTH1βa+12βcTH2βc−βaTGq−βcTGqwhere(16)G=∫∂Ω(RP)TLdsBy∂πe/∂βi=0(i=1...m), we can yield(17)[H1H2][βaβc]=Gqand(18)[βaβc]=[H1H2]−1GqSubstituting Eq. (18) into Eq. (12), one obtains(19)U=12qTGT[H1H2]−1GqBy comparison withU=(1/2)qTKq, one can conclude the element stiffness matrix(20)K=GT[H1H2]−1GSubstituting Eq. (18) into Eq. (10), the stress distribution can be expressed as follows:(21){σa=P1βa=P1H1−1Gq,σc=P2βc=P2H2−1Gq.Moreover, the necessary condition for the element avoiding the spurious zero energy modes is that the rank of the element stiffness matrix may satisfy(22)rank(K)=n−rwhere n is the total number of nodal displacements, andris the number of rigid-body modes in an element.From Eqs. (21) and (22), one can obtain m as the number of independentβ(23)m≥n−r,m=rank(H),rank(K)=rank(G),in whichH=[H1H2]is the full rank matrix.The ranks of matrixGandHare all depended on the number of the assumed stress coefficientsβ. Each extra term may increase the unwanted element rigidity on the contrary and overuse of stress modes will also cost more computational time because the calculation of element stiffness matrix requires inversion of the flexibility matrix whose rank is equal to the number of stress modes. Therefore, least-order stress modes are considered to be optimal with respect to efficiency.Based on the plane couple stress theory and hybrid stress element method, as shown inFig. 1, the formulation of 18-DOF couple stress hybrid stress element is proposed. Six degrees of freedom are used at each node in the element.The stressσof the 18-DOF triangular hybrid stress element for couple stress theory is assumed as follows:σ={σx,σy,τs,mx,my}T=Pβ(24)P=[P1P2]The couple stress part can be expressed by6βi.e.P2=[1xy1xy],and conventional stress partP1can be expressed by the Airy stress function with15β(Table 1).It should be noted that the stress distributionσshould satisfy the equilibrium Eq. (5) and Airy stress function satisfies the condition.The boundary forceTcan be expressed as(25)T=R[P1P2][βaβc]in which the matrixRcan be derived from the boundary forces (4) as follows:T={TxTyTω}=[σxnx+τsny−12(∂mx∂x+∂my∂y)nyσyny+τsnx+12(∂mx∂x+∂my∂y)nxmxnx+myny]=[nx0ny−ny∂2∂x−ny∂2∂y0nynxnx∂2∂xnx∂2∂y000nxny][σxσyτsmxmy]=Rσand(26)R=[R1R2]whereR1=[nx0ny0nynx000],R2=[−ny∂2∂x−ny∂2∂ynx∂2∂xnx∂2∂ynxny]The stress–strain relations(27)σ=DεwhereDis defined in Eq. (7).The prescribed displacements on the boundaryu¯is given as(28)u¯=[u˜v˜ω˜]T=Lqwhereu˜,v˜are displacement interpolations,ω˜is the rotation interpolation on the boundary andq=[q1Τq2Τq3Τ]T,(qi=[uiviui,xui,yvi,xvi,y]T,i=1,2,3).In order to make the element with second-order accuracy in its domain and C0/C1 weak continuous on the interface between the adjacent elements, cubic interpolation for interface displacements (producing quadratic rotation) is introduced.(i)Interpolations of the displacement componentsu˜andv˜of boundary displacement vectoru¯.Using the parameters at nodes 1 and 2, which areui,viandui,x,vi,x,ui,y,vi,y(i=1,2), the interpolations of the displacementsu˜andv˜on 1–2 boundary are given as beam functions(29)u˜=N1u1+Ns1u1,s+N2u2+Ns2u2,sv˜=N1v1+Ns1v1,s+N2v2+Ns2v2,swhere shape functionsN1,Ns1,N2,Ns2are(30){N1=L1+L1L2(L1−L2)Ns1=(L1L2+L1L2(L1−L2))⋅L/2N2=L2+L1L2(L2−L1)Ns2=(−L1L2+L1L2(L1−L2))⋅L/2whereLis the beam length, andL1=1−s/L,L2=s/L, in whichsis the coordinate along the 1–2 boundary.In Eq. (29), at nodes 1 and 2 the relationship between parametersui,s,vi,sandui,x,ui,y,vi,x,vi,y(i=1,2)can be expressed as(31)ui,s=−nyui,x+nxui,yvi,s=−nyvi,x+nxvi,ywherenx=y2−y1(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2,ny=x1−x2(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2are the direction cosines of the element boundary as shown in Fig. 1.Interpolations of rotation componentω˜of boundary displacement vectoru¯.To derive the interpolation of rotationω˜in Eq. (28), the interpolations ofu˜,n,u˜,son 1–2 boundary are given by(32)u˜,n=L1u1,n+L2u2,nu˜,s=−6L1L2/L⋅u1+L1(1−3L2)⋅u1,s+6L1L2/L⋅u2+L2(1−3L1)⋅u2,sBy using the relation,(33)[u,xu,y]=[nx−nynynx][u,nu,s],[u,nu,s]=[nxny−nynx][u,xu,y]and Eq. (33),u˜,ycan be obtained as follows:(34)u˜,y=[−6nxL1L2/L3nxnyL1L2L1−3nx2L1L26nxL1L2/L3nxnyL1L2L2−3nx2L1L2]qu1−2wherequ1−2=[u1u1,xu1,yu2u2,xu2,y]T.Following the similar procedure,v˜,xis obtained:(35)v˜,x=[6nyL1L2/LL1−3ny2L1L23nxnyL1L2−6nyL1L2/LL2−3ny2L1L23nxnyL1L2]qv1−2whereqv1−2=[v1v1,xv1,yv2v2,xv2,y]T.The rotationω˜on the boundary can be expressed as(36)ω˜=12(u˜,y−v˜,x)=12[−6nxL1L2/L−6nyL1L2/L3nxnyL1L2L1−3nx2L1L2−L1+3ny2L1L2−3nxnyL1L26nxL1L2/L6nyL1L2/L3nxnyL1L2L2−3nx2L1L2−L2+3ny2L1L2−3nxnyL1L2]q1−2The corresponding displacement parameters shown in Fig. 1 on the 1–2 boundary areq1−2=[u1v1u1,xu1,yv1,xv1,yu2v2u2,xu2,yv2,xv2,y]TBased on Eqs.(29) and (36), the matrixLon the 1–2 boundary can be expressed as follows:(37)[u˜v˜ω˜]T=L1−2q1−2Numerous efforts techniques have been proposed for developing finite element models, but most work has focused on improving assumed stressσas the matrixP. A new method for the formulation of hybrid elements with5βterms stresses was reported by Pian [21], which contains a minimum number of stress parameters. Orthogonal approach for hybrid element methods was developed by Chen and Sze et al. [25–28].In this paper, after confirmation of proper matrixP, refined technology is introduced by improving the displacement interpolationsu¯on the boundary. Refined method was proposed by Chen and Cheung [29,30] to improve nonconforming elements.Using the parameters at nodes 1 and 2, which areui,viandui,y,vi,x(i=1,2)an alternative expression of the rotation interpolations on the boundary can be given as(38)ω˜⁎=L1ω1+L2ω2=12(L1u1,y+L2u2,y−L1v1,x−L2v2,x)whereω1,ω2are the rotation at nodes 1 and 2.Eq. (38) with linear accuracy and Eq. (36) with quadratic accuracy are two kinds of rotation interpolations on the boundary. Both of them can satisfy the requirement to pass the C0–1 patch test. In order to improve the element’s accuracy, an alternative expression of the rotation for refined hybrid stress element can be written as(39)ω˜+α(ω˜−ω˜⁎)whereαis a constant to be determined empirically later.It should be stressed here thatαis not fundamental to the present formulation, since the results inTable 4 show that the refined elements can all pass the patch test, irrespective of whetherαis equal or unequal to zero. Indeedαis only used as a tool to improve the performance of the element.Based on Eqs. (29) and (39), the matrixLon the 1–2 boundary for refined hybrid stress element can be expressed as follows:(40)u¯=[u˜v˜ω˜+α(ω˜−ω˜⁎)]T=L1−2q1−2whereαis determined by using comparison of accuracy of numerical examples (in Section 5.3, Stress concentration at the boundary of a hole). In this paper, the refined technique only uses the refined rotation partω˜as Eq. (39). From the calculation results it is found that the best results are achieved whenα=−1. Then we suggest the valueα=−1when using the 18-DOF refined hybrid stress element.Then, along the boundary 1–2,Gcan be obtained(41)G12=∫∂Ω(1−2)(RP)TL1−2dsSimilarly, along the other boundaries, G23, G31 can also be obtained by cyclic permutation.Once solving the element nodal displacement vectorq, the element stresses can be given by Eq. (21)(42)σ=[σaσc]=[P1βaP2βc]=[P1H1−1GqP2H2−1Gq]The stress smooth techniques introduced by Zienkiewicz et al. [31,32] for displacement elements can be used to improve the accuracy of the hybrid stress element. In Eq. (40), the smooth stresses are chosen asσa=P1βa,βa=[β1⋯βN], and N =11 (the number of{βi}Table 2).Based on the enhanced patch test proposed by Chen and Soh [18,33], the test function can be assumed as follows:(43){u=a1+a2x+a3y+a4x2+ax5y+a6y2v=b1+b2x+b3y+b4x2+bx5y+b6y2whereai,bi(i=1…6)are constants to be determined.Substituting Eq. (43) into equilibrium Eq. (8), the test functions for couple stress element can be obtained as follows:(44){u=a1+a2x+a3y+a4x2−2[(1−2μ)b4+2(1−μ)b6]xy+a6y2v=b1+b2x+b3y+b4x2−2[2(1−μ)a4+(1−2μ)a6]xy+b6y2The rotation test functionsux,uy,vx,vyare first derivatives of Eq. (44)(45){ux=a2+2a4x−2[(1−2μ)b4+2(1−μ)b6]yuy=a3−2[(1−2μ)b4+2(1−μ)b6]x+2a6yvx=b2+2b4x−2[2(1−μ)a4+(1−2μ)a6]yvy=b3−2[2(1−μ)a4+(1−2μ)a6]x+2b6ywherea1,a2,a3,a4,a6,b1,b2,b3,b4,b6are arbitrary constants.This set of displacement components gives linear rotation and constant curvatures.In this test, the coefficientsaiandbiof the test functions in Eqs. (44) and (45) are listed in Table 3.The size of the domain is0.24×0.12, the material parameters arel=0.5,E=1000andμ=0.25.Fig. 2 shows the mesh used for the patch test. The displacements at the nodes on the boundaries are imposed according to Eq. (44) and Table 3.The numerical results of the patch test at node 1 are listed in Table 4. The results of the patch test demonstrate that both the refined hybrid stress element and standard hybrid stress element can pass the enhanced patch test.In this section, the beam model and meshes are shown inFig. 3(1) and (2) which are same as those in Stolken’s micro-bending test [34] and material constants of the beams: length of the beamL=250μm, depth of the beamh=12.5μm, the elastic modulusE=220GPa, Poisson’s ratioμ=0.31, the bending momentM=50Nμm. The analytical solution [35] is given as(46)v=−6M(1−μ2)Eh[h2+24(1−μ)l2](x2+μ1−μy2)Numerical analysis is done by triangular couple stress hybrid stress element. Keep the beam constant and change the material constantlto examine the scale effect.Numerical results of the deflection of the beam are given inFigs. 4 and 5, which show that the deflection of the beam in couple stress theory is smaller than that in the classical elasticity (l=0) as the material constantlincreases. The numerical results show that the strong size effects appear in the beam also show that triangular hybrid stress element for couple stress theory applied here has high accuracy.Stress concentration problems can be used to check the size effect and the accuracy of the element. An infinitely large elastic plate containing a circular hole of radiusrshown inFig. 6 is subjected to a uniformly distributed forcepin thexdirection. Different values of the Poisson ratio (μ=0.0andμ=0.5) and material characteristic lengthlare used in the analyses. To avoid denominator being zero in constitutive Eq. (7),μ=0.49999is used to substituteμ=0.5. Material constants are same as those in Ref. [36]: side length2L=32.4mm, the elastic modulusE=200GPa, tension application in two sidesp=1Pa. Owing to symmetry in geometry and boundary conditions, only a quarter of plate is meshed for the analysis.The analytical solution can be found in Ref. [37], in which the method of separation variables is applied to solve the stress concentration around the circular hole in a field of uniform tension with the couple stress theory.The parameterαin Eq. (39) for refined hybrid element is determined by comparison using numerical examples. Numerical examples show that the results of pure bending beam are less sensitive toαbut the results of stress concentration problem are sensitive toα. After analysis of numerical examples shown inFigs. 8 and 9, refined hybrid stress element has higher accuracy whenα=−1. It should be noted that the functions of the parametersu˜,y,v˜,xhave linear accuracy on the boundary whenα=−1, and the element is standard hybrid stress element whenα=0.Tables 5 and 6 andFigs. 10 and 11 show the convergence of the element performance with mesh refinement. As shown in Fig. 7, NC is the number of elements on the boundary of 1/4 hole( three meshes with NC=4, 6, 8). The performance of refined hybrid stress element is good enough as the mesh is refined to NC=8 with 256 elements and 153 nodes.The performance of the hybrid stress element is also compared with the following elements formulated by Shu et al. [36]:QU34L4, a 9-node quadrilateral element with 34-DOF and 4 Lagrange multipliers.QU54L16, a 9-node quadrilateral element with 54-DOF and 16 Lagrange multipliers.QU34L4+QU34L16, a 9-node quadrilateral element with 34-DOF and 16 Lagrange multipliers.TU24L4, a 6-node triangular element with 24-DOF and 4 Lagrange multipliers.Tables 7 and 8 show the stress concentration factors on the boundary of the circular hole obtained by various elements forμ=0.0andμ=0.5, respectively. The percentage errors in the numerical solutions are listed within parentheses. The stress concentration factor plots againstl/rare shown inFigs. 12 and 13 (in order to show the relationship more clearly, two typical elements QU34L4 and TU24L4 are selected and compared with refined hybrid stress element in the plots). In Ref. [36], all computations were carried out using a mesh of 720 quadrilaterals and 2983 nodes. Triangular elements were generated by sub-dividing a quadrilateral along a diagonal. However, the mesh employed in this study only consists of 256 elements and 153 nodes. A comparison of the results obtained by the refined hybrid stress element with those given in Ref. [36] reveals that the element proposed in this paper is more accurate than the element TU24L4. Indeed, the refined hybrid stress element attained a similar accuracy compared with elements QU34L4, QU54L16 and QU34L4 +QU34L16 with a mesh of less than one-tenth of nodes (256 elements and 153 nodes against 720 elements and 2983 nodes). The elements in Ref. [36] have 6 DOF for each corner node and 2 DOF for each mid-side node, and 2983 nodes were used in the numerical examples.In this section, a simple shear problem is solved herein. Due to its simplicity, this problem (or its variants) has recently been studied analytically or computationally as a benchmark problem [38]. Consider a block of widthw, lengthL, and heighthundergoing a simple shear deformation, as shown in Fig. 13. AssumeLandwthat are much larger thanhsuch that they both can be viewed as infinite. The prescribed displacementu˜0is induced by a shear force acting on the top boundaryy=h.Numerical results are shown inFigs. 13 and 14, where the classical elasticity solution [38] is also displayed for comparison. For illustration purpose, the material properties for the block are taken to beE=1.44GPa,μ=0.38,l=17.6μm. To see the influence of material microstructure (as represented byl), two other cases with different values ofl(i.e.,l=8.8μmandl=1.76μm) are also included in this parametric study. The geometric parameters used here areh=100μm,u˜0=1μm.It is seen fromFigs. 15 and 16 that the boundary layer (or sticking) effect can be captured by the present solution. Also, it can be observed that the influence of the microstructure (throughl) can be significant: the larger the value ofl, the larger the difference between the predictions by the present solution and by the classical elasticity solution. The numerical results quantitatively show that the influence of the length scale parameter can be significant.

This paper presents a hybrid stress element method, which is perfectly fit for establishing couple stress element. The method can satisfy the condition of enhanced patch test easily as long as the chosen functions can satisfy the equilibrium equations in the domain of the element, such as the15βAiry stress functions and the boundary displacement interpolation functions using the node parameters in this paper. Other methods reach the condition after much difficulty and jolting or cannot reach the condition. The formulae of hybrid stress element method are simple and practical.Refined method is used to improve the accuracy of the element just by changing the value ofα, and it really works. Moreover, stresses smooth technique is also a necessity and effective way to improve the stress accuracy.A refined 18-DOF triangular hybrid stress element is given out in the paper, and is used for numerical analysis on pure bending problem, stress concentration problem and simple shear problem. Our examples show that the element, with simple form formulae, high precision and stability of convergence, can pass the patch test and be used for multi-scale analysis.
