@&#ABSTRACT@&#
BackgroundOver two decades of research has been conducted using mobile devices for health related behaviors yet many of these studies lack rigor. There are few evaluation frameworks for assessing the usability of mHealth, which is critical as the use of this technology proliferates. As the development of interventions using mobile technology increase, future work in this domain necessitates the use of a rigorous usability evaluation framework.MethodsWe used two exemplars to assess the appropriateness of the Health IT Usability Evaluation Model (Health-ITUEM) for evaluating the usability of mHealth technology. In the first exemplar, we conducted 6 focus group sessions to explore adolescents’ use of mobile technology for meeting their health Information needs. In the second exemplar, we conducted 4 focus group sessions following an Ecological Momentary Assessment study in which 60 adolescents were given a smartphone with pre-installed health-related applications (apps).Data analysisWe coded the focus group data using the 9 concepts of the Health-ITUEM: Error prevention, Completeness, Memorability, Information needs, Flexibility/Customizability, Learnability, Performance speed, Competency, Other outcomes. To develop a finer granularity of analysis, the nine concepts were broken into positive, negative, and neutral codes. A total of 27 codes were created. Two raters (R1 and R2) initially coded all text and a third rater (R3) reconciled coding discordance between raters R1 and R2.ResultsA total of 133 codes were applied to Exemplar 1. In Exemplar 2 there were a total of 286 codes applied to 195 excerpts. Performance speed, Other outcomes, and Information needs were among the most frequently occurring codes.ConclusionOur two exemplars demonstrated the appropriateness and usefulness of the Health-ITUEM in evaluating mobile health technology. Further assessment of this framework with other study populations should consider whether Memorability and Error prevention are necessary to include when evaluating mHealth technology.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Mobile technology has become almost ubiquitous among millions of Americans. At the same time, mobile health (mHealth) technology applications (apps) have also increased in availability and popularity [1]. For example, 13,000 health-related iPhone apps were available for consumer use in 2012 [2]. mHealth interventions are increasingly important instruments in the toolkit of public health professionals and researchers [3–5]. For example, an increasing number of mobile disease management programs for chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease [6] are being developed. Additional examples of mobile health apps include interventions that help people quit smoking [7] or lose weight, or mental health apps to address depression, and/or anxieties [8]. Moreover, patient access to their health records via personal health records and patient portals make it increasingly appealing for patients to view their personal health information in real-time via mobile devices.Despite the growth and popularity of mHealth apps, more than 95% have not been tested [9]. For instance, a recent systematic review revealed that there are only 42 controlled trials of mobile technology interventions for all disease processes and the effects that were demonstrated are only modestly beneficial [10]. In another recent study, Whitlock and McLaughlin studied three apps for tracking blood glucose and found that each product may present a number of usability issues, including small text, poor color contrast and scrolling wheels, especially for older adults [11]. As a result, further research needs to be done to ensure that mobile health technologies are appropriately designed and targeted to the end-users’ needs before they are used as health interventions [12]. Prior to the trial of mHealth technologies for improving clinical outcomes, it is imperative that IT designers pay close attention to the usability of these technologies.Usability factors are a major obstacle to health information technology (IT) adoption. While health IT such as mHealth tools can offer potential benefits, they can also interrupt workflow, cause delays, and introduce errors [13–15]. Lack of attention to health IT evaluation may result in dissatisfied users, decreased effectiveness, and increases in error costs [16]. While the promise of mHealth is that we can leverage the power and ubiquity of mobile and cloud technologies to monitor and manage side effects and treatment outside the clinical setting, it is essential to be attentive to usability, keeping in mind its intended users, task and environment.Many health IT usability studies have been conducted to explore usability requirements, discover usability problems, and design solutions, but few of these studies have evaluated the usability of mobile technologies. Currently there are few evaluation frameworks for these technologies making rigorous evaluation a challenge. In this paper, we seek to demonstrate through the use of two data sources, the applicability of the Health-ITUEM usability evaluation framework – which addresses gaps in existing usability models – for evaluating mobile technologies [17].
