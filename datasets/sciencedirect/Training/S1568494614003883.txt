@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To overcome computerized intractability and imprecise estimation of the standard cardinalized probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter for multitarget tracking (MTT), an improved CPHD filtering algorithm is proposed in this paper. We apply Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to achieve the closed-form solution in the filtering process as well as to avoid missed detection. Afterwards we partition the particle set into surviving particles and newborn particles based on the particle labels. To eliminate the over-estimated target number, the weights of newborn particles are assigned to increase to surviving particles on average. Simulations are presented to compare the performance of the proposed filtering algorithm with that of the standard one. The results show that the proposed filtering algorithm can effectively achieve MTT with better performance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multitarget tracking (MTT) involves joint estimation of target number and target state from uncertain measurements. Usually the target number varies with time as targets appear or disappear, in addition, the measurement number generated by all targets and part of clutters also changes with time [1,2]. Therefore, how to accurately track multitarget under complicated circumstance has become a focus of academic research.In recent years, the scholars have been dedicated themselves to the field of the MTT with a great deal of achievements, many papers with respect to filtering algorithms were one after the other published in important journals. The representative work can be found in [3,4] by Mahler and Vo. In the literature, the random finite set (RFS) method has attracted substantial interest. Using the RFS approach to model collections of a finite and time-varying number of targets and measurements, as early as 2003, Mahler provided a rigorous Bayesian framework which brought about the development of a number of multitarget filters, where the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter has been receiving significant attention. This filter propagated the first order moment of the multitarget posterior, and the PHD recursion operates on the single-target state space and avoids the target-measurement association. However some fluctuations in target number-estimates maybe occur due to the Poisson's assumption for the cardinality distribution [5,6]. To further improve the filtering performance, the cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter emerges as the times require, which offers a nice cure by adding memory to the target number process. The CPHD filter introduces an artificial linkage among all targets’ survival probabilities, which seems to work effectively in most of applications that we have seen since 2006. In addition, the CPHD filter propagates the cardinality distribution to the PHD with the first and second order multitarget moments of the multitarget posterior, see for example [7,4,8], and the references therein. Thus the CPHD filter prefects the PHD filter with a hierarchically supervising hidden Markov model that describes the target number at each scan, that is, the cardinality of the RFS is not restricted to be the Poisson's distribution. On the other hand, the CPHD filter behavior is more heavily influenced by its underlying multitarget dynamic model. If actual target birth or death in particular scenario deviates from the corresponding model, it will tend to respond more sluggishly, the Monte Carlo sense. Consequently there are three main problems with the standard CPHD filtering algorithm: (i) it is difficult to obtain the closed-form solution because the propagation equations involve multiple integrals; (ii) some targets are easy to miss to a certain extent in view of the imperfection of sensors; (iii) the instantaneous estimate of the target number obtained from particle weights may be high due to the clutter interference.To solve the first two problems, some methods have been reported in some academic periodicals. First the important technique was proposed in [9] that the closed-form solution in the PHD filter can be achieved based on the bin-occupancy method. Subsequently a CPHD filter was presented in [10] to deal with the problem of lack of closed-form solution by utilizing the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method as the PHD function was propagated. Though both bin-occupancy and SMC methods represent the closed-form solution to the PHD propagation equation, the unstable target number cannot be yet overcome in the filtering process. As a result, the estimated target state is bound to fluctuate. To avoid the missed detection [11], depicted a new CPHD filter whose update of the total cardinality distribution was exact, and the local target number-estimates close to the missed detection were reduced. Lately in [12] an improved Gaussian mixtures (GM) implementation of CPHD filter was proposed to minimize the effect of estimation errors by dynamic weighting approach. Owing to the weight modification [11,12], the weight of the missed detection part of the PHD is assumed homogeneous, which does not affect the estimate of the cardinality distribution. Nevertheless both schemes are only restricted to the GM-CPHD filter and are not fit to the SMC-CPHD filter.According to current investigations, a few works have been reported to involve in the last question, and we have to face up to the fact of the over-estimated number of targets. To synthetically remedy difficulties of the standard CPHD filter above mentioned, we propose an improved SMC-CPHD filter. Different from the previous work, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: (i) the PHD function is approximated by labeled particles with their weights. In the SMC method, as the particle number increases, the PHD is close to the optimal Bayes estimation and then represents the closed-form solution. At the same time, the undetected targets can be effectively discovered; (ii) the over-estimated number of targets has been automatically revised based on the assignment of particle weights. If a measurement is within the validation gate of the predicted position from any track, it is considered as the target originated and assigned higher weights. On the contrary, if a measurement is not within the validation gate of any predicted position, it is seen as the newborn target or the false alarm assigned lower weights. Then the measurement excluded any target trajectory is removed after five cycles, which means false alarms are eliminated.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the principle of the standard CPHD filtering algorithm. In Section 3, the improved CPHD filtering algorithm is discussed in detail. In Section 4, two scenarios are presented with simulation results to compare the tracking performance. Finally we sum up the paper by providing the future work in the last section.Note that the model incorporates the target motion, birth and death. We utilize two RFS models for Nktarget statesXk=xk,1,⋯,xk,Nkand MkmeasurementsZk=zk,1,⋯,zk,Mkat scan k. To simplify presentation, we make two remarks in order: (i) without respect to the target spawning, target motions are independent; targets disappear from the scene; newborn targets appear in the scene independently of survival targets; (ii) the detection probability of sensors is set as a constant pDregardless of xk. Then the standard CPHD filter, consisting of initialization, prediction, update, and state estimation [6,8], operating on the RFS model in one cycle can be presented as follows:Initialization step: Assume s0(x0) is the initial probability density whose peak is corresponding to the target position, the initial PHD can be defined as(1)D0(x0)=n0s0(x0)where n0 is the estimated number of targets, in addition, the initial cardinality distribution on n0 is ρ0(n0).Prediction step: AssumepS,k|k−1xk−1is the probability density of a survival target with the previous state xk−1, and Bk(x) is the probability generation function (PGF) of newborn targets, the PGF of a discrete probability distribution is given by(2)Gk|k−1(x)=Bk(x)⋅Gk−1(1−s[pS,k|k−1(xk−1)]+x⋅s[pS,k|k−1(xk−1)])wheres[h]=∫h(x)⋅D(x)Ndx. Let ρB(n) be the cardinality distribution of newborn targets, the predicted cardinality distribution can be written as(3)ρk|k−1(n)=∑j=0nρB(n−j)j⋅Gk−1(1−s[pS,k|k−1(xk−1)])⋅s[pS,k|k−1(xk−1)]jOn the other hand, Dk−1(xk−1) is assumed the posterior PHD with xk−1, the predicted PHD equation can be written as(4)Dk|k−1(xk)=∫pS,k|k−1(xk−1)⋅fk|k−1(xk|xk−1)⋅Dk−1(xk−1)dxk−1+bk(xk)where fk|k−1(·|xk−1) is the single-target Markov transition density for xk−1, bk(xk) is the intensity of spontaneous newborn targets for xk. Then the predicted expected number of targets is given by(5)Nk|k−1=NS,k|k−1+NB,k|k−1=∫pS,k|k−1(xk−1)⋅Dk−1(xk−1)dxk−1+∫bk(xk)dxkwhere NS,k|k−1 and NB,k|k−1 are the expected number of survival and newborn targets respectively.Update step: Assume C(x) is the PGF of false alarms, the updated PGF of a discrete probability distribution is given by(6)Gk(x)=∑j=0mxj⋅Cm−j(0)⋅Gˆk|k−1j(x⋅(1−s[pD]))⋅σj(Zk)∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆk|k−1j(1−s[pD])⋅σj(Zk)where(⋅)jdenotes the jth derivative; σj(Zk) is the elementary symmetric function of Zk. Then the updated cardinality distribution can be written as(7)ρk(n)=∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅1(n−j)!⋅Gˆk|k−1jn−j(0)⋅s[1−pD]n−j⋅σj(Zk)∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆk|k−1j(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)Denote the likelihood of sensors byLzkand the Poisson false alarm process by c(zk), the updated PHD equation at scan k can be calculated as(8)Dk(xk)=(1−pD)⋅∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆk|k−1j+1(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆk|k−1j(1−s[pD])⋅σj(Zk)+pD⋅∑zk∈Zk∑j=0mLzk⋅Cm−j−1(0)⋅Gˆk|k−1j+1(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk−{zk})c(zk)⋅∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆk|k−1j(1−s[pD])⋅σj(Zk)⋅Dk|k−1(xk)Subsequently the updated expected number of targets is given by(9)Nk=NS,k+NB,k=∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆk|k−1j+1s1−pD⋅(s[1−pD])⋅Gˆk|k−11(1)+j⋅Gˆk|k−1j(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆk|k−1j(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)Estimation step: In this step, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator can be used to estimate the target number. The MAP estimator ignores minor modes and then locks onto the more stable major model, which can produce more accurate target number-estimates.(10)nˆk(xk)=argsupnρk(n)Finally we drawnˆkclusters to estimate target state by using k-mean clustering method. Note that the center of each cluster describes a local maximum of the intensity function and gives state-estimates of a target [13]. The dynamic states of all targets can be estimates by usingnˆklocal maximum peaks.Remark 1Let us discuss the standard CPHD filter process on both aspects: (i) the predicted PHD propagation given in (4) and the expected number of targets given in (5) are involved in multiple integrals operation. Two equations are inevitably lack of closed-form solution. As a result, the calculation in the prediction step is often intractable even for the linear Gaussian dynamics; (ii) the detection probability of sensors pDin the update step is often less than 1, which means the filter cannot detect all targets at each scan due to the detection imperfection. Thus the over-estimated number of newborn targets and false alarms maybe occur at a particular scan.The SMC method, devised to approximate probability density, can effectively deal with plenty of complex and intractable issues [14,15]. In this section, we sketch the basic elements of the SMC-CPHD filter to get the closed-form solution [16,17].Initialization step: At scan k=0, we extract J0 equally weighted particles{w0(i),x0(i)}i=1J0to approximate the initial PHD(11)D0(x0)=∑i=1J0x0(i)⋅δ(x0−x0(i))Prediction step: In this step, we propagate a new particle set{wk−1(i),xk−1(i)}i=1Jk−1to represent the posterior PHD and the predicted cardinality distribution in time(12)Dk−1(xk−1)=∑i=1Jk−1wk−1i⋅δ(xk−1−xk−1i)Let κ denote the required particle number per target, we have in hand Jk−1=κNk−1. Owing to the survival and newborn targets, the corresponding survival and newborn particles should be considered together. Therefore the predicted PHD at scan k can be given by an equally weighted particle setwk|k−1i,xk|k−1ii=1Jk|k−1, which is(13)Dk|k−1(xk−1)=∑i=1Jk|k−1wk|k−1iδ(xk−1−xk|k−1n,i)To achieve the number of predicted particles Jk|k−1, we consider the survival particle number JS,k|k−1 and the newborn particle number JB,k|k−1 respectively(14)Jk|k−1=JS,k|k−1+JB,k|k−1Furthermore the discrete probability distribution of survival targets is defined as(15)pS(i)=pS,k|k−1(xk|k−1i)∑i=1Jk−1pS,k|k−1(xk|k−1i)Let round (·) denote the integer approximation, we can extract JS=round(JS,k|k−1) particles from pS(i) to represent targets that survive into scan k. To model newborn targets, we also have the corresponding discrete probability distribution as follows:(16)pB(i)=bk(xk|k−1i)∑i=1Jk−1bk(xk|k−1i)Similarly JB=round(JB,k|k−1) particles from pB(i) are drawn to described targets that spontaneously appear at scan k. Then (15) can rewritten as(17)Jk|k−1≅JS+JBFurthermore the predicted expected target number isNk|k−1=Jk|k−1κ.Update step: AssumeLzk(⋅)is the sensor likelihood function given by the available measurement zk, the integralDk|k−1[pDLzk]in the updated equation can be written as(18)Dk|k−1[pDLzk]≅1Jk|k−1∑i=1Jk|k−1pD⋅Lzk(xk|k−1i)Considering the current measurement set Zk, we have the following formula based on Bayesian rule [6](19)1Jk|k−1∑i=1Jk|k−1θ(xk|k−1i)⋅LZk(xk|k−1i)=∑i=1Jk|k−1θ(xki)⋅wkiwhere θ(·) is the unitless function,LZk(xk|k−1i)is the particle representation of the sensor likelihood function given by Zk, which is(20)LZk(xk|k−1i)=(1−pD)⋅∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆj+1(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆj(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)+pD⋅∑zk∈ZkLzk(xk|k−1i)⋅∑j=0m−1Cm−j−1(0)⋅Gˆj+1(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk−{zk})c(zk)⋅∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆj(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)For simplicity, we mark two parameters as follows:(21)Λ0=∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆj+1(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆj(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)(22)Λk=∑j=0m−1Cm−j−1(0)⋅Gˆj+1(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk−{zk})c(zk)⋅∑j=0mCm−j(0)⋅Gˆj(s[1−pD])⋅σj(Zk)Substituting (20)–(22) into (19), we can obtain the updated particle weight under the condition ofxki=xk|k−1i(23)wki=(1−pD)Jk|k−1⋅Λ0+pDJk|k−1⋅∑zk∈ZkΛk⋅Lzk(xk|k−1i)Estimation step: By using the present particle set, the estimated number of targets can be rewritten as(24)Nk=round∑i=1JwkiNote that the resampling can avoid the particle degeneracy when a number of particle weights would become negligible after a great deal of iterations. Of course the resampling remains the particle number for each target particles unchanged with time. We resample a new set of particles with their weightsxk,wki/Nki=1Jkfrom the original setxk|k−1,wki/Nki=1Jk|k−1. Then we rescale the weights by Nktoxk,wkii=1Jkso that the sum of particle weights in the resampled set keeps same as before [6,15]. At this time, the particle representation of the PHD function can be written as(25)Dk(x)=∑i=1Jkwki⋅δ(x−xki)Finally Nklocal maximum PHD peaks present the state-estimates based on the k-means clustering method. Thus Nkclustersmk1,mk2,⋯,mkNkare seen as the multitarget state-estimatesXˆk=mk1,mk2,⋯,mkNk.Remark 2When a probable false alarm within a particular surveillance area is approximated to the measurement of one or more random newborn particles, there may be a false target that affects the tracking precision. Although this case has a certain chance, the SMC-CPHD filtering algorithm in the prediction step usually produces a large number of newborn particles to find new targets as soon as possible. As a regular, the number chance will bring out a great deal of errors [10,15,18]. Especially in the case of smaller variance of clutters, some false alarms may be preserved to a certain extent. As a result, all the newborn particles including false-alarm particles are regarded as true targets and then lead to the increased number of targets.Assume Xkand Fk|k−1 are the state vector and the state transition matrix, Γkand Wkare the state noise input matrix and the state noise vector, Zkand Hkare the measurement vector and the observation matrix, and Vkis the observation noise [19,20], we have the target state and measurement equations as follows:(26)Xk=Fk|k−1Xk−1+ΓkWk(27)Zk=HkXk+VkAccording to the SMC-CPHD filter, we rewrite (26) and (27) as(28)Xk=Fk|k−1001Xk−1i+Γk0Wk(29)Zk=Hk0Xk−1i+VkNote that each particle in the whole particle set has its own label i that indicates the corresponding target identity. In (28) and (29), the particle is evolved with its label, and the weight is predicted and updated according to the available measurement information. By retrieving i, the particle set can be divided into two parts, that is, the surviving particles (i=1, ⋯, JS) and the newborn particles (i=JS+1, ⋯, JS+JB). Consider the particle position follows the Gaussian distribution with the mean Zk, the predicted position for the current scan k can be obtained once we have the position at the previous scan k−1 [18]. Applying the position information, we can implement the assignment of particle weights in (23) as follows:First we setZk†be as the validation gate of the given track at scan k, if a available measurement zkis within the validation gate of the predicted position from any track (zk≤Zk†), we consider it more likely to be target originated and the corresponding particles are surviving, which should be chosen based on the prior about the target state. Then we assign them higher weights. On the other hand, if a measurement zkis not within the validation gate of any predicted position (zk>Zk†), we still generate a number of particles around it. The reason can be explained that the particles are more likely to have originated from newborn targets or false alarms. Therefore these particles should be assigned lower weights. At this time, (23) can be rewritten as(30)wki=(1−pD)Jk|k−1⋅Λ0+pDJk|k−1⋅∑zk∈ZkΛk⋅Lzkxk|k−1ii=1,⋯,JS∑zk≤Zk†Λk⋅Lzkxk|k−1i+∑zk>Zk†Λk⋅Lzkxk|k−1ii=JS+1,⋯,JS+JBNext we mark the multiplying factor μk(μk≤1) for newborn particles (zk>Zk†) in the term∑zk>Zk†Λk⋅Lzkxk|k−1i.(31)wki=(1−pD)Jk|k−1⋅Λ0+pDJk|k−1⋅∑zk∈ZkΛk⋅Lzkxk|k−1i+Δki=1,⋯,JSpDJk|k−1⋅∑zk≤Zk†Λk⋅Lzkxk|k−1i+∑zk>Zk†μk⋅Λk⋅Lzkxk|k−1ii=JS+1,⋯,JS+JBwhere Δkis the compensation component to all surviving particles on average because of the reduced particle weights. Due to the equivalent sum of all weights before and after the transformation, we can get the value of Δk.(32)∑i=1JS+JBwki=∑i=1JS(1−pD)Jk|k−1⋅Λ0+pDJk|k−1⋅∑zk∈ZkΛk⋅Lzkxk|k−1i+Δk+∑i=JS+1JS+JB(1−pD)Jk|k−1⋅Λ0+pDJk|k−1⋅∑zk≤Zk†Λk⋅Lzkxk|k−1i+∑zk>Zk†μk⋅Λk⋅Lzkxk|k−1iConsider the surviving particles, there is only one situation, that iszk≤Zk†.

As soon as the weights of newborn particles are reduced, we measure whether it satisfieszk>Zk†and excludes any target trajectory or not. Once the time is more than five cycles, we consider that the corresponding particle represents the false alarm, which should be removed [20]. Note that the number of particles and their weights are constantly updated. We use the most effective particles to achieve reliable target number.This section presents numerical studies for the proposed CPHD filtering scheme. To verify the tracking performance, we consider two-dimensional scenarios with unknown and time-varying number of targets observed in clutters within the surveillance region−500,500×−500,500m2. Our experimental environment was: Intel™ Core Duo 2.9GHz, 4GB DDR Memory, and MATLAB™ v7.8.The targets move with the constant velocity (CV) model and the constant turn (CT) model respectively for a period 50 scans, where the sampling period is set as T=1s. In the dynamic model given in (28) and (29), the target state is a vector of the planar position and velocityX=x,x˙,y,y˙T, where (·)T denotes a transpose of matrix, and other matrices are as follows:X0=−450120−120−1202652214−300160−70−701211−2911,Γk=T2/20T00T2/20T,Wk∼N0,0.32000.12,Hk=10000010, andVk∼N0,0.520.52.Given that the number of unknown targets varies with time, the probability of survival targets is set as 0.95. We have the intensity of the target birth(37)bkx=0.1Nx;mB1,PB+Nx;mB2,PB+Nx;mB3,PBwheremB1=−450,0,−300,0T,mB2=120,0,160,0T,mB3=−120,0,−70,0T,PB=diag5,1,5,1, and diag(·) denotes the diagonal matrix.The clutter is modeled as a Poisson RFS with the uniform density within the surveillance region, where the average number of clutters returns per unit hyper volume is 5. The sensor is located on the coordinate origin (0, 0) and its detection probability is 0.92. We suppose that the detection threshold of measurements is 0.8, the multiplying factor of newborn particles weight is set as 0.55. Furthermore the optimal sub pattern assignment (OSPA) miss distance is utilized to measure two scenarios.(38)dp(c)(X,Y)=1nminπ∈Πn∑k=1mdc(xk,yπk)p+cp(n−m)1pwhere c>0,dpc(X,Y)is the miss distance between two point subpatterns X and Y under the condition of m≤n in terms of the pth order average Wasserstein distance.For the CV model, we define the state transition matrix in (28) asFk|k−1=1T000100001T0001. Four target-trajectories in x and y coordinates versus time are plotted in Figs. 1 and 2. Their motion times aret1=1,27s,t2=5,32s,t3=12,37s, andt4=26,50srespectively. In Fig. 1, we can see that Target 3 in x coordinate is close to Target 1 at scan k=24, 25, 26, 27. As is shown in Fig. 2, in y coordinate, Target 3 is nearing Target 1 at scan k=18, 19; Target 4 makes a stealthy approach to Target 1 at scan k=26, 27. From Figs. 1 and 2, we can see that there is no any collision among all target tracks in any observation time within the surveillance region. Subsequently Fig. 3demonstrates the target tracks and measurements in the dense clutter area, where the solid line and the asterisk denote the true position and the measurement respectively. Fig. 4shows the target number-estimates, it can be seen that both filtering algorithms can track targets. Due to the clutter interference, the standard CPHD filtering algorithm has some drawbacks such as false alarms and missed detections. For comparison, the improved CPHD filtering algorithm effectively eliminates the clutter interference. Fig. 5shows the target number-estimates, where the solid line denotes the true number. We can see that the standard filtering algorithm has unstable number of targets. For example, the algorithm over-estimates one target at scan k=6, 16 because of the effect of close clutters. In addition, it misses one target at scan k=19, 31, 36 due to the imperfection of sensors. On the contrary, the estimated number of targets by using the improved filtering algorithm through the observation period coincides with the actual number. Finally Fig. 6plots the OSPA miss distance. It can be seen that the standard filtering algorithm has larger OSPA miss distance while false targets occur, where the maximum value can even reach 322.46m. Furthermore the total value of the OSPA miss distance of the standard filtering algorithm is twice more than that of the improved filtering algorithm.For the CT model, the state transition matrix is defined asFk|k−1=1sinωT/ω0−(1−cosωT)/ω0cosωT0−sinωT0(1−cosωT)/ω1sinωT/ω0sinωT0cosωT,where ω=5°/s, and other parameters are the same as in Scenario 1. For illustration purpose, Figs. 7–12successively provide the simulation results. First Figs. 7 and 8 demonstrate the target trajectories in x and y coordinates respectively. It can be seen that Target 3 makes an approach to Target 2 at scan k=25, 26 in x position; in y position, Target 3 keeps close to Target 1 at scan k=14, 15 and is nearing Target 4 at scan k=27, 28, 29, 30. According to the two-dimensional trajectories in the whole surveillance time, there is no any collision among four targets within the surveillance region yet. Next Figs. 9 and 10 show the measurements and the trajectory-estimates. Comparison two figures, we can see that the target position-estimates from the standard CPHD filtering algorithm become poor when the targets move close to the dense clutter areas. Fig. 11 demonstrates the target number-estimates at each scan. It is obvious that the number of false alarms is significantly increasing due to the clutter interference, where one over-estimated detection occurs at scan k=6, 27, and one missed detection happens at scan k=19, 36. Nevertheless the standard filtering algorithm generates an obvious bias in the target number-estimates. When some targets move close to the dense clutter areas, the bias of target number becomes more significant. The plot demonstrates that the deviations from the improved filtering algorithm are slightly smaller. Finally Fig. 12 demonstrates the OSPA miss distance. We can see that the standard filtering algorithm has larger distance and higher error peaks when the incorrect target number happens. And what is more, the maximum value of the OSPA miss distance 588.93m can be obtained at scan k=29. Further analysis has proved that notwithstanding the superficially correct number of targets given in Fig. 11, there is one potential alarm around Target 2 happened and one true target (Target 4) missed at this scan. Therefore we have to get the credible results combined the target number-estimates and the corresponding OSPA miss distance. For comparison, the improved filtering algorithm has only 40.94% OSPA miss distance of the former with actual number of targets.In addition, we perform 100 Monte Carlo runs to compare tracking performance under the same scenario. The performance comparison of the proposed filtering algorithm and the referred algorithm in [10] is given in Table 1. Note that the proposed filtering algorithm provides more accurate number-estimates as well as improves 134.94% OSPA miss distance of the referred algorithm. As illustrated in this table, we can also see that the extra running time of the proposed filtering algorithm is 0.4681s. The reason can be explained that it the accurate target number-estimates and small positional errors at the expense of reweighting particle weights. As we know, the particle index increases one dimension in the state equation that causes the extra computational complexity. Besides it will take some time to access target trajectories in the process of the assignment of particle weights. As a result, the running time of the proposed filtering algorithm is slightly long. However, considering the overall tracking performance, our algorithm is acceptable.
