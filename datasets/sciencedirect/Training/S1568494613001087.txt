@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Social tagging systems leverage social interoperability by facilitating the searching, sharing, and exchanging of tagging resources. A major drawback of existing social tagging systems is that social tags are used as keywords in keyword-based search. They focus on keywords and human interpretability rather than on computer interpretable semantic knowledge. Therefore, social tags are useful for information sharing and organizing, but they lack the computer-interpretability needed to facilitate a personalized social tag recommendation. An interesting issue is how to automatically generate a personalized social tag recommendation list to users when a resource is accessed by users. The novel solution proposed in this study is a hybrid approach based on semantic tag-based resource profile and user preference to provide personalized social tag recommendation. Experiments show that the Precision and Recall of the proposed hybrid approach effectively improves the accuracy of social tag recommendation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The main feature of social tagging systems is that the medium they provide for users to communicate implicitly by sharing social tags to describe Web resources. These social tags are built for a common taxonomy, also known as a folksonomy [1]. More and more content on the Internet is generated by folksonomies. The folksonomies have been used in various Web 2.0 applications, such as Delicious, Youtube, Flickr, and CiteULike. The concept of folksonomy has been applied in Web 2.0 to enhance the accessibility, retrievability, reusability, and interoperability of Web resources. Social tags are used as a popular way to allow users to provide metadata in the folksonomies. Some research works [2,3] attempt to provide personalized services based on folksonomy environment, such as tags recommendation [4–6], content or resources recommendation [7,8], user preference construction [9], and personalized search [10,11], etc. Unfortunately, these researches regard social tags as keywords to combine the statistical methodology or probabilistic model for above research issues. The main limitation of such approaches is that social tags focus on keyword and human interpretability rather than semantics and computer interpretability. The Semantic Web [12–16] provides a catalytic solution to this problem.This study focuses on the social tag recommendation problem in folksonomies. By combining conventional term frequency scheme and semantic technology, it automatically generates the Web resource profiles needed for personalized social tag recommendation. In this study, ontology technologies were integrated with tags to enhance semantic reasoning, and the original tags can be retained to cooperate with ontologies and rules. Restated, since the proposed approach does not change the original tags, metadata for existing tags are still usable. This study mainly aims to enhance the knowledge representation of the folksonomies for personalized social tag recommendation. It makes two main contributions. (1) This study combines conventional term frequency scheme and ontology technology to automatically generate semantic tag-based resource profile. (2) This study develops a hybrid approach based on semantic tag-based resource profile and user preference to provide personalized social tag recommendation.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents some related works. Section 3 describes the automatic construction of semantic tag-based resource profile algorithm. A hybrid approach for personalized social tag recommendation is presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents experimental results for evaluating proposed approaches. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 6.
