Discrimination between different degrees of coronary artery disease using time-domain features of the finger photoplethysmogram in response to reactive hyperemia

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
PPG combined with ECG in FMD test can discriminate between different degrees of CAD.PPG from both index fingers and angiograms were recorded from 48 patients.Subjects are regrouped as high-risk (2VD, 3VD) and low-risk (NC, Mild, SVD) groups.k-NN gives an accuracy of 81.5%, a sensitivity of 82.0% and a specificity of 80.9%.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Atherosclerosis is a major cause of coronary artery disease leading to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, coronary angiography is considered to be the most accurate technique to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD). However, this technique is an invasive and expensive procedure with risks of serious complications. Since the symptoms of CAD are not noticed until advanced stages of the disease, early and effective diagnosis of CAD is considered a pertinent measure.In this paper, a non-invasive optical signal, the finger photoplethysmogram (PPG) obtained before and after reactive hyperemia is investigated to discriminate between subjects with different CAD conditions. To this end, the PPG from both index fingers and standard 3-lead ECG of 48 patients (16 females, age 54.3±9.6 years and 32 males, age 59.9±10.6 years) scheduled for diagnostic angiography were recorded. The coronary condition of each subject was determined by three expert cardiologists (ground truth) based on these coronary angiograms. Of the 48 patients, 18 were diagnosed as having no disease (normal coronary – NC), 3 were diagnosed as having mild stenosis (MLD), 11 had single-vessel disease (SVD), 5 had two-vessel disease (2VD) and the remaining 11 were reported to have three-vessel disease (3VD). A vessel disease was determined when a significant (more than 50%) stenosis of the lumen cross-sectional area was observed. The 48 subjects were first grouped into two classes, namely high-risk: Class 1={2VD, 3VD} (N=16) and low-risk: Class 2={NC, Mild, SVD} (N=32). Using this approach, classification using a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier leads to an accuracy of 81.5%, a sensitivity of 82.0% and a specificity of 80.9%. Then all 48 subjects were regrouped slightly differently by moving the SVD subjects from the second (low-risk) to the first (high-risk) class. Therefore for the second approach high-risk: Class 1={SVD, 2VD, 3VD} (N=27), whereas low-risk: Class 2={NC, Mild} (N=21). This second approach resulted in an accuracy of 78.8%, a sensitivity of 79.3% and a specificity of 78.3%. We submit that this technique can be employed to implement an efficient triage system for scheduling coronary angiography, as it is able to identify non-invasively patients at greater risk of coronary stenosis.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Although far from being perfect, we propose that a direct application of our approach is the implementation of an efficient triage system for scheduling coronary angiography. With this respect, we believe that the proposed technique is able to non-invasively determine patients at a greater risk of CAD (sensitivity 82.0% and negative predictive value 90.0%), and as such can assist the medical care-takers in scheduling them for earlier coronary angiography. Another related aspect is the cost-efficiency obtained through the possibility of reducing the number of angiograms done on patients with a normal coronary (NC) outcome. In our set of randomly selected patients, an astounding 37.5% were found to have no artery stenosis (18 subjects from the 48 recruited). Given the associated costs, patient inconvenience and exposure risks associated with X-ray angiography, any reduction in the number of such procedures will help ease the financial burden on the healthcare system and at the same time decrease the hassle and waiting time for those patients truly needing it.Finally, due to the convenience of recording the PPG and the non-invasive nature of the FMD test, if established as a guideline this diagnostic method will be much safer and simpler to perform compared to invasive angiography. The proposed PPG-FMD technique does not require any onerous equipment or skilled-operator, resulting in an overall much more affordable implementation, especially in the context of developing countries
