@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Fetal maturation age assessment based on heart rate variability (HRV) is a predestinated tool in prenatal diagnosis. To date, almost linear maturation characteristic curves are used in univariate and multivariate models. Models using complex multivariate maturation characteristic curves are pending.To address this problem, we use Random Forest (RF) to assess fetal maturation age and compare RF with linear, multivariate age regression. We include previously developed HRV indices such as traditional time and frequency domain indices and complexity indices of multiple scales.We found that fetal maturation was best assessed by complexity indices of short scales and skewness in state-dependent datasets (quiet sleep, active sleep) as well as in state-independent recordings. Additionally, increasing fluctuation amplitude contributed to the model in the active sleep state. None of the traditional linear HRV parameters contributed to the RF models. Compared to linear, multivariate regression, the mean prediction of gestational age (GA) is more accurate with RF than in linear, multivariate regression (quiet state:R2=0,617vs.R2=0,461, active state:R2=0,521vs.R2=0,436, state independent:R2=0,583vs.R2=0,548).We conclude that classification and regression tree models such as RF methodology are appropriate for the evaluation of fetal maturation age. The decisive role of adjustments between different time scales of complexity may essentially extend previous analysis concepts mainly based on rhythms and univariate complexity indices. Those system characteristics may have implication for better understanding and accessibility of the maturating complex autonomic control and its disturbance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since heart rate patterns are one of the few signals obtainable from the fetus easily and non-invasively, they are predestinated for assessing the maturating fetal autonomic control and its disturbances [1–5]. The complex behavior of the maturating fetal autonomic nervous system (ANS) was recently described by means of corresponding heart rate variability (HRV) indices. However, the maturation itself is a complex and non-linear process. Interpretation of non-linear complexity characteristics is ambiguous and has been discussed with the formation of fetal behavioral states [6–8]. On the basis of changes in the power spectra, van Leeuwen et al. showed that maturation is characterized by non-linear characteristics [9] and different stages of fetal development were discussed in association with the increasing influence of the different branches of the ANS [3,10]. However, to date the complex maturation process was mainly approximated by linear characteristic curves in univariate regression models using linear and non-linear HRV indices [6,9–11]. The investigation of the performance of the best predicting HRV indices in a multivariate model using non-linear and complex maturation characteristic curves is pending. Hoyer et al. recently proposed a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS) for the assessment of fetal age, based on MLR models according to universal developmental characteristics [12,13]. However, parameter selection for MLR models in these investigations was based on a pre-selection of HRV indices. Since even the maturation characteristic curves are not known and they can be different for different HRV indices, a complex non-linear approach without pre-setting is required.With regard to that, classification and regression tree (CART) methodology such as Random Forest (RF) may provide potential advantages [14]. The non-linear and complex data structures of RF provide an ambitious technique for data mining, e.g. in geoinformatics [15,16] or computational biology [17–19]. A direct comparison between ordinary linear regression and RF was done by Nir et al., who investigated the performance of both models for the assessment of the nociception level under anesthesia [20]. They found that the advanced, non-linear approach performed better than linear regression. However, a general statement on the superiority of RF compared to other linear and non-linear models is limited due to the fact that the accuracy of predictions is biased by different methodological approaches and results heavily depend on the underlying problem [21]. With respect to clinical applications, researchers often try to obtain as much information as possible from the investigated process. Modeling such processes with common linear methods requires previous knowledge of interactions between variables and explicit modeling of non-linearities. RF as a non-linear, multivariate regression and classification methodology is able to overcome this problem, even when values are missing [14]. Additionally, the assessment of the parameter importance employed in RF provides a beneficial tool for the identification of important variables avoiding pre-selection of HRV parameters on the basis of single characteristic curves. Single applications of RF to heart rate time series in adults have been reported with satisfying results, e.g. in connection with sleep state classification [22], classification of cardiac rhythms [23], risk stratification for arrhythmic cardiac death [24], or the prediction of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events [25]. As far as is known to the authors, the only application of RF in the context of fetal development was published by Peterek et al. who classified pathological, suspect and normal fetal states based on cardiotocography (CTG) measurements [26]. However, due to its restricted temporal resolution, CTG is of limited appropriateness for the precise assessment of fast heart rate modulation [27]. According to the “developmental origins of adult disease (Barker) hypothesis” (also known as fetal programming) [28], the precise evaluation of the normal development is important with respect to the early identification of fetal developmental disorders since these have implications for health problems in later life which cannot completely be compensated for by later postnatal therapies [29].The objective of the present work is to evaluate the capability of a complex maturation model, using previously developed HRV indices obtained from high resolution fetal magnetocardiographic (fMCG) recordings and complex maturation functions to predict fetal gestational age (GA) for the assessment of normal fetal development. Further, we compare results of GA prediction from RF methodology with linear, multivariate age regression.
