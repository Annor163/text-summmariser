@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The payload packing problem of a satellite module (SM3P) belongs to a complex engineering layout and combinatorial optimization problem. SM3P can not be solved effectively by traditional exact methods. Evolutionary algorithms have shown some promise of tackling SM3P in previous work; however, the solution quality and computational efficiency are still challenges. Inspired by previous works (such as divide-and-conquer and no free lunch theorem), this study designs three-stage solution strategy in the light of the characteristics of SM3P and proposes a hybrid multi-mechanism optimization approach (HMMOA) integrating knowledge heuristic rules with two evolutionary algorithms such as ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in different stages. Firstly, the payloads to be placed are assigned to different bearing surfaces in the distribution stage. Then SM3P is decomposed into several subproblems solved by the heuristic ACO algorithm in the second stage, where a better feasible packing scheme obtained by the knowledge-based heuristic ACO is further improved by a heuristic adjustment strategy. At last, the solutions of different subproblems are combined to form a whole solution that is optimized by PSO in a way of rotation to minimize both errors of the mass center and inertia angle while other design objectives remain unchanged. The experimental results illustrate the capability of the proposed HMMOA in tackling the complex problem with better solution quality while less computational effort.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Three-dimensional (3D) layout design problems are commonly encountered in many fields such as automobile industry, mechanical engineering, and aerospace industry [1–3]. As one kind of classical and complex layout design problems, the payload packing problem of a satellite module (SM3P) is discussed in this paper. The problem concerns the placement of payloads such as equipment and instruments (short for components) on different bearing surfaces in the module so that a set of design objectives can be optimized while satisfying given spatial and performance constraints [2]. Payloads packing scheme directly affects the performance, service life, structure and maintenance of the whole system. A reasonable and harmonious packing design is essentially a common property of most successful satellites. The optimization of the packing scheme is one of the key techniques to improve the global performance of a satellite [4]. However, SM3P is a nonlinear and multi-modal optimization problem that is almost impossible to be fully solved by traditional optimization techniques due to its NP-hard computational and engineering complexity.SM3P belongs to a 3D packing problem with performance constraints on which the state-of-the-art research results were surveyed by Cagan et al. and Kicinger et al. [5,6] and can be discussed by Aladahalli et al. [7,8]. For SM3P, the existing solutions are classified into the following categories.(1)Heuristic algorithms. For example, Teng et al. [9] established the mathematical model and proposed the sensitivity analysis approach and several heuristic rules.Evolutionary algorithms. Grignon and Fadel [10] proposed a pareto genetic algorithm to make a more informed decision on a tradeoff issue among the various design objectives and solve the configuration problem of a satellite. Cagan et al. [11] proposed an efficient annealing-based simulation algorithm to solve layout problems of the car engine and heat pump, whose idea is also useful to calculate an approximate solution of the spacecraft payload packing problem. Jacquenot et al. [12] advanced a multi-target placement algorithm for the free-form component packing problem. The algorithm in Ref. [12] can also be used in solving the multi-objective constrained spacecraft payload packing problem due to their similarity.Human-computer interactive and cooperative evolutionary design. Tanner and Fennel [13] adopted the visual human-computer interactive technology and constraint-based reasoning method to study how to place the equipment into the racks of space station freedom module. Based on an evolutionary mechanism, Potter et al. [14] proposed a cooperative co-evolutionary framework, a dynamic optimization method, where multiple cooperating subpopulations are used to co-evolve the solution components. Braun et al. [15] presented a collaborative optimization approach for the packing design problem of a single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. Taking the ZS3-SAT satellite as an example, Kamran et al. [16] used the configuration design and human-computer interactive technology to deal with the component packing problem of a satellite. Qian et al. [17] proposed a human-computer interactive genetic algorithm. Liu and Teng [18] put forward a human-machine cooperative evolution algorithm based on several knowledge solutions. Wang et al. [4] devised a cooperative co-evolutionary scatter search approach. Huo and Teng [19] described a co-evolutionary method based on a three-stage strategy, which includes the distribution of components among subspaces, the detailed packing design within subspaces and the packing design of the whole scheme. Huo et al. [20] designed a human-computer co-operative co-evolutionary method to find a better solution. Teng et al. [2] proposed a dual-system variable-grain cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (DVGCCGA).Hybrid algorithms. Sun and Teng [21] gave a two-stage approach where the centripetal balancing strategy and quasi traveling salesman model-based ant colony optimization (ACO) are used in the coarse packing design and detailed packing design. Zhang et al. [22] devised a hybrid method through an organism combination of the quasi-principal component analysis, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (QPGP). Shi et al. [23] designed a modified artificial bee colony algorithm.Although more and more efforts have been made on SM3P, it seems a long way to achieve a satisfying and practical engineering solution using a general-purpose approach. The open issues for further study involve how to improve the computational precision, the efficiency and the success rate. These issues stem from the following characteristics: a high dimensional real solution space larger than 2×the number of components, the complex nonlinearity of the finess function including conflicting performance constraints and objective functions, and time-consuming calculation of the overlapping area in the finess function. These characteristics directly result in the premature convergence and low computational efficiency, even failures in the solution process, and particularly, the third one, it is a bottleneck which restricts further development of different approaches [2,4,9,17–23] in performance. Inspired by no free lunch theorem [24] and previous done work, this paper proposes a hybrid multi-mechanism optimization approach with the adjustment strategy (HMMOA). The basic strategy can be summarized as follows. (i) SM3P is decomposed into several subproblems in a way of bearing surfaces according to the divide-and-conquer idea. (ii) A heuristic ACO with an adjustment strategy is proposed to solve each subproblem to obtain better solution. (iii) The whole solution combined by the solutions of subproblems is further improved by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) search technology to minimize both errors of the mass center and inertia angle of the whole packing scheme. Four key issues of the considered HMMOA can be summarized as follows.(a)How to obtain the packing knowledge and its mathematical representation;How to construct the knowledge-based heuristic mechanism (ordering and positioning rules);How to construct the optimized mechanism of a heuristic ACO to eliminate the bottle-neck and define the related embedding degrees for implementing the local adjustment;How to optimize both errors of the mass center and inertia angles by PSO in a way of conciseness.The contributions of the proposed HMMOA different from approaches [2,4,9,17–23] can be stated as follows. (i) For the heuristic ACO of the considered HMMOA, it is not required to perform a time-consuming calculation of overlapping areas and the search space of the optimal packing scheme of each bearing surface is reduced by transformation from a real value space to an integer space; (ii) through the local adjustment, the marginal region of the packing scheme obtained by the heuristic ACO is further optimized to decease the moment of inertia and the enveloping radius; (iii) both the setoff amount of the mass center and inertia angles of the whole satellite module are further optimized to minimum values by the proposed PSO, while the moment of inertia and the envelope radius remain unchanged.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is the problem statement and its mathematical model. Then the component distribution among bearing surfaces is described in Section 3. And in Section 4, the payload packing optimization approach of the bearing surface is proposed. Then the optimization approach for the whole packing scheme is presented in Section 5. The performance test and analysis of the proposed HMMOA is in Section 6. Lastly, Section 7 is the summary of this paper.The payload packing problem of a simplified international commercial communication satellite module (INTELSAT-III) (shown in Fig. 1(a)) can be described as follows. The upper and lower surfaces (P1–P4) (see Fig. 1(b)) of two bearing plates attached on a standing column in the module are used to hold all components, which are simplified as ξ cylinders with the mass miand radius ri(i=1,2,…,ξ) and ζ cuboids with the mass mi, length ai, width biand height hi(i=ξ+1, ξ+2,…,ξ+ζ), respectively.In this study, cuboids and cylinders are regarded as rigid bodies with a uniform mass allocation. The objective of the design is to optimize the inertia performance and size of the whole module and is subjected to the following constraints. (i) Non-overlapping constraints, namely all the components should be contained within the satellite module, without any overlapping area among components and no clash between the module wall and each component. (ii) A static imbalance constraint, i.e., the offset of the mass center of the whole module should not exceed an allowable value, and be smaller as possible. (iii) Inertia angle constraints, namely all three inertia angles should be less than the allowable value, and as small as possible.To describe the mathematical model of SM3P, three coordinate systems are firstly defined.A reference coordinate system Oxyz is shown in Fig. 1(a), which is used to calculate the mass center of the satellite module and define the installation site of components. The coordinate origin O is set at the geometric center of the downward binding surfacel of the satellite module. The z axis is the longitudinal symmetric axis of the module, and the upward direction is positive when launching. The x axis is perpendicular to its longitudinal surface. The right hand rectangular coordinate system is composed of the y axis with x, z axes.A planet coordinate system O′x′y′z′is shown in Fig. 2, which is used to calculate the moment of inertia and product of the inertia of the satellite module. The coordinate origin O' is allocated on the mass center of the satellite module. The z′, x′ and y′ axes are parallel to three axes z, x and y, with the same direction, respectively.A local coordinate system O″x″y″z″ of each component is used to calculate the moment of inertia of the component in relation to the axis itself. The origin O″ is set at the mass center of the component. x″, y″ and z″ are geometric symmetry axes of the component, respectively. In general, z″ is parallel to the z axis, and x″ and y″ have angles with x and y axes, respectively (see Fig. 2).Let (xi,yi,zi) be the coordinate of the mass center of the i-th component (i=1,2,…, ξ+ζ) in the coordinate system oxyz, and (αi, βi, γi) indicates the orientation with respect to a global coordinate system, then the whole packing scheme (of a satellite module)X=∪i=1ξ+ζ(xi, yi, zi, αi, βi, γi) and the mathematical model can be described as follows: findingXwhich will minimize ||J(X)||1 to the minimum and satisfy Formulas (1)–(3). Here ||J(X)||1=Jx′+Jy′+Jz′ which are calculated by Formulas (4)–(6). Formula (1) denotes non-overlapping. Formula (2) represents that all offsets of the mass center coordinates are less than a predetermined value δmrespectively. Formula (3) indicates that all three inertia angles of directions x, y and z are smaller than a given value δθrespectively.(1)f1(X)=∑i=0ξ+ζ−1∑j=i+1ξ+ζΔVij≤0(2)||(f2(X), f3(X), f4(X))||∞≤δm(3)||(θx'(X), θy'(X), θz'(X))||∞≤δθΔVijrepresents the overlapping area between two components i and j. f2(X)=zm−ze, f3(X)=xm−xe, f4(X)=ym−ye, where (xm, ym, zm) and (xe, ye, ze) represent the actual and desired mass center coordinates respectively, and δmis their maximal error. θx′(X), θy′(X) and θz′(X) indicate angles between the principal axis of inertia of the module and reference axis x, y, z along each direction (see Formulas (7)–(9)), and δθis their maximal error.(4)Jx′(X)=∑i=0ξ(Jx″icos2αi+Jy″isin2αi)+∑i=0ξ+ζmi(yi2+zi2)−(ym2+zm2)∑i=0ξ+ζmi(5)Jy′(X)=∑i=0ξ(Jy″icos2αi+Jx″isin2αi)+∑i=0ξ+ζmi(xi2+zi2)−(xm2+zm2)∑i=0ξ+ζmi(6)Jz′(X)=∑i=0ξ+ζJz″i+∑i=0ξ+ζmi(xi2+yi2)−(xm2+ym2)∑i=0ξ+ζmiFormulas (4)–(6) denote the moment of inertia with respect to the three directions, respectively. Jx″i, Jy″i, Jz″iare the moment of inertia of component i(i=1,2,…,ξ+ζ) with respect to its own coordinate system x″,y″,z″; аi(i=ξ+1,ξ+2,…,ξ+ζ) is the placement angle of the cuboid i (its bottom rectangle).(7)θx′(X)=0.5arctan2Jx′y′(X)(Jx′(X)−Jy′(X))(8)θy′(X)=0.5arctan2Jx′z′(X)(Jz′(X)−Jx′(X))(9)θz′(X)=0.5arctan2Jy′z′(X)(Jz′(X)−Jy′(X))(Jx′y′,Jx′z′,Jy′z′) is the product of inertia of the whole module with respect to the planet coordinate system and is calculated by Formulas (10)–(12).(10)Jx′y′(X)=∑i=0ξ+ζ[mixiyi+Jx″i+mi(yi2+zi2)2sin2αi]−∑i=0ξ+ζ[jy″i+mi(xi2+zi2)2sin2αi]−xmym∑i=0ξ+ζmi(11)Jx′z′(X)=∑i=0ξ+ζmixizi−xmzm∑i=0ξ+ζmi(12)Jy′z′(X)=∑i=0ξ+ζmiyizi−ymzm∑i=0ξ+ζmiThe main task of the first stage is to assign all ξ+ζ components to four bearing surfaces P1–P4 shown in Fig. 1. Let Si(i=1,2,3,4) be the sum of areas of bottoms of components distributed on the surface Pi, and S be the maximal value of the allowable areas on four bearing surfaces. According to Ref. [19], the objective functions relative to the variable z are extracted from minimizing ||J(X)||1, and can be simplified as(13)minΓ1(ℜ)=∑i=0ξ+ζmizi2−zm2∑i=0ξ+ζmi+c1(14)s.tf2(ℜ)=|zm−ze|≤δzmandmax{S1,S2,S3,S4}≤σSwhere c1 is a constant, σ0=∑i=1ξ+ζsi/(4π(R2−Rc2)) and σ∈[σ0,σ0+0.2], R and Rcare shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), respectively. So, the task can be described as follows: Find a distributionℜ{ℜi,ℜi∈{1, 2, 3, 4}, i=1,2,…,ξ+ζ} so that it satisfies Formula (13) and (14). Here, Formula (14) ensures that the error between the calculated and expected centroids zmand zeof whole packing scheme should not exceed the allowable value δzmand components located on each bearing surface do not exceed the bearing surface capacity.Set Γ(ℜ)=Cmax−Γ1(ℜ) where Cmax is a big positive number to ensure that Γ(ℜ)>0. M1 denotes the population size. N1 denotes the maximum number of generations. Pcro and Pmut are the crossover and mutation probabilities, respectively. A quaternary-coded genetic algorithm for finding an optimal distribution for four bearing surfaces can be described as follows.Step1. Construct M1 distribution schemes of n components:ℜ1,ℜ2, …,ℜM1satisfying Formula (13) and take them as individuals of the genetic algorithm. Set j=1;Step2. Through two-point crossover, uniform mutation,ℜM1+1,ℜM1+2, …,ℜ2M1are obtained;Step3. For i=M1+1, M1+2,…,2M1, ifℜidoes meet the constraint and receptive rule in Formula (14), then calculate Γ(ℜi); otherwise, Γ(ℜi)=10−2;Step4. If j=N1 thenℜopt=ℜkwith max Γ(ℜi), go to Step5; otherwise, updateℜ1,ℜ2, …,ℜM1according to their linear ranking, j=j+1, go to Step2.Step5. Outputℜopt, and the algorithm ends.After payloads are allocated to four bearing surfaces, the solution quality of SM3P depends on those of four bearing surfaces. By omitting heights of components, the packing problem of the bearing surface Pi(i=1,2,3,4) can be transformed into the problem of packing ξpicircles and ζpirectangles in a circular container with the moment of inertia as less as possible. For approaches in Refs. [2,4,9,17–23], their solution qualities and computational efficiencies and success ratios are restricted due to the high dimensional real solution space, the complex nonlinearity of the finess function and bottleneck problem of calculating overlapping area. Stoyan and Yaskov [25] describe an effective approach for the circle and rectangle packing problem. But because of different container and constraints, it could not be used in solving the packing problem of the bearing surface. So, inspired by Sun and Teng and Wolpert and Macready [21,24], a heuristic ACO with local adjustment (LAHACO) is considered.According to Subsection 2.1, It can be known that the radius and mass of the circle corresponding to the cylinder i (i=1, 2, …, ξp) are riand mi, respectively. The length, width, mass, and placement angle of the rectangle corresponding to the cuboid i (i=ξp+1,ξp+2, …, ξp+ζp) are ai, bi, miand αi, respectively. LetY={(xi, yi) ∪(xj, yj, αj), i=1,2,…, ξp, j=ξp+1, ξp+2, …, ξp+ζp} and take xm=ym=zm=0. According to Formula (4)–(6),Jx′+Jy′+Jz′=2Σi=1ξp+ζpmi(xi2+yi2)+c2, where c2 is a constant. The payload packing problem of the bearing surface P is to find a feasible solutionY(i.e., without any overlapping area) to minimize ||J(Y)||1 (see Formula (15)).(15)∥J(Y)∥1=∑i=1ξp+ζpmi(xi2+yi2),ACO is an optimization approach simulating ant colony foraging in the real world [26–29]. The ant lays the pheromone on its foraging path and selects a path forward according to the strength of the pheromone. The shorter a path is, the more ants passing through the path, further the pheromone on short path is strengthened, and vice-versa. So, the ant colony can finally find food along the shortest path.The circle and rectangle packing problem can be taken as a multi-stage decision-making problem solved by ACO [21]. Each decision-making of the ant in Ref. [21] decides the moving direction of a component to generate a better packing scheme. For the packing problem in Subsection 4.1, the multi-stage decision-making of the ant generates a placing sequence of the items in the following process.LetIp={1,2,…, (ξp+ζp)}. Suppose that, the items t(1),t(2),…,t(i−1) have been packed in the first i−1 decision-making stages. SetWi=Ip−{t(1), t(2),…, t(i−1)}. Then, at the i-th stage, there exist ξp+ζpselections for the ant. The process of selecting the items j (1≤j≤ξp+ζp) through roulette-wheel and positioning it with the feasible positioning rule can be considered as that the ant in nature has searched for the edge denoted by (t(i−1)^j) (1≤j≤ξp+ζp). Let probt(i−1)j(j∈Wi) represent the probability of selecting the j-th item in the i-1th stage, then it is calculated by Formula (16) where bt(i−1)jis the pheromone on the edge (t(i−1)^j) and η1 is a positive integer. A path consists of ξp+ζp−1 edges and corresponds to a layout scheme.(16)probt(i−1),j=bt(i−1),jη1Σj∈Wt(i−1)bt(i−1),jη1,j∈W(t(i−1).Property 1: LetY1 be a 2D packing scheme of ξp+ζpitems (ξpcircles and ζprectangles).Y2 is the packing scheme obtained by interchanging positions of two items i and j inY1, where two integers i, j∈[1,ξp+ζp] and i≠j. If mi>mjand di>dj, then ||J(Y1)||1>||J(Y2)|| 1.According to Property 1, it should be tried to pack the items with a larger mass in the center region of the container for constructing a packing scheme with a smaller moment of inertia. For this reason, the mass miof the item i (i=1,2,…, ξp+ζp) is taken as the heuristic information, i.e., the probability factor of roulette wheel. So, probt(i−1)jis calculated by Formula (17) rather than Formula (16), where η2 is a positive integer (η1=1, η2=1).(17)probt(i−1),j=bt(i−1),jη1mjη2Σj∈Wibt(i−1),jη1mjη2,j∈Wi.Ant System (AS), Ant Colony System (ACS) and ANTS are three types of ACO and the convergence speed of ACS type is faster than those of AS and ANTS types [27]. Therefore, the considered ACO will be designed in the ACS type based on Maximum and Minimum Ant System (MMAS) [30]. Let the trajectory matrixT=[bij](ξp+ζp)×(ξp+ζp) andYopt be the current optimal packing scheme. After M2 ants have constructed packing schemesY1,Y2, …,YM2,Ybest with the minimum Jz′(Y) is computed. If Jz′(Ybest)<Jz′(Yopt),Yopt=Ybest. Then,Tis updated through Formula (18) and pheromones of edges on the optimal path are strengthened according to Formula (19). By several iterations, a final packing optimalYopt and its enveloping radius Ropt can be obtained.(18)bij=t×bij(0<t<1)(19)bij=1+BJz′(Yopt)×bijwhere B is a large constant. By program debugging, take B=106 for Experiment in Section 6. In addition, in order to avoid premature convergence of the algorithm, take bij=0.1/(ξp+ζp) when bij<0.1/(ξp+ζp) or bi,j=10/(ξp+ζp) when bij>10/(ξp+ζp).For solving a packing problem, especially a large-sized layout problem, the positioning rule plays an important role in improving computational performance. Regarding the heuristic positioning rule, most studies focus on packing circles in a circular or rectangular container [31–36] and packing rectangles in a circular container [37]. But the positioning rule of packing circles and rectangles in the circular container has not been found. Based on Refs. [31–37], the positioning rule will be proposed to construct the feasible packing scheme for the circle and rectangle packing problem.(I)Circle positioning ruleLetIc={1,2,…,ξp} andLcbe a list which stores all pairs of order numbers of circles. For a permutation {t(1),t(2),…,t(ξp)} ofIc, the circle-positioning rule can be described as follows.(i)Centers of the first two circles t(1) and t(2) are placed at (−rt(1), 0) and (rt(2), 0) respectively and a pair of numbers (t(1):t(2)) is stored intoLc.Circles t(3), t(4), …, t(ξp) are positioned in turn based onLc. For the circle t(i), after calculating all candidate positions through every pair of order numbers (u:v) inLcand Formula (20)-(22), the position with the minimum objective function value is found from all candidate positions. All pairs of order numbers generated newly are stored intoLc. For example, before circle 5 is positioned, all pairs of order numbers inLcare (1:2), (1:3), (2:3), (1:4) and (2:4). Four candidate positions of circle 5 shown in Fig. 3(b) are (1:3), (2:3), (1:4) and (2:4), respectively.Rectangle positioning rule [37]LetIr={1, 2, …, ζp} and (xj,yj) (j=1, 2, …, ζp) denote the center of the rectangle j. For a permutation {t(1),t(2),…,t(ζp)} ofIr, the rectangle positioning rule in Ref. [37] is described as follows. Firstly (xt(1),yt(1))=(0,0), αt(1)=0° and (t(1),xt(1),yt(1),αt(1)) is stored inLr. Then candidate centers and placement angles of the rectangle t(i) (i=2,3,…,ζp) are calculated in turn based on the following two steps. Step 1 is to take αt(i)=0° (or 90°) and make one of four vertices of the rectangular i coincide with that of the rectangle t(j) (j<i) having been packed (see Fig. 4). In step 2, the optimal position (xt(i),yt(i),αt(i)) of the rectangle t(i) is found from all candidate positions and is stored inLr.(III)Circle and rectangle positioning ruleAn advantage of two positioning rules in Subsection 4.3.3 (I) and (II) is that the overlapping area calculation can be avoided and the packing scheme constructed is relatively compact. But in terms of obtaining a high quality packing scheme, it is difficult to determine whether the circle and rectangle packing problem should be transformed into the circle packing problem by replacing each rectangle with its circumcircle (shown in Fig. 5(a)) or the rectangle packing problem by replacing each circle with its circumscribed rectangle (shown in Fig. 5(b)). Therefore, an effective positioning rule combining them is described as follows.For the packing order setIp={t(1),t(2),…,t(ξp+ζp)} of ξp+ζpitems, if the item with the number t(1) is circular, then (xt(1),yt(1))=(0,0); otherwise, (xt(1),yt(1), αt(1))=(0,0,0°). (xt(1),yt(1),rt(1) or ŕt(1)) and (t(1),xt(1),yt(1),αt(1)) are stored inLcandLr, respectively. Suppose that the items t(1),t(2),…,t(i−1) have been packed where ncitems are circular. With the positioning rule in Subsections 4.3.3 (I) for the nccircles and circumcircles of i-ncrectangles (shown in Fig. 6(a)) and one in Subsections 4.3.3 (II) for i-ncrectangles and circumscribed rectangles of nccircles (shown in Fig. 6(b)), candidate positions of the item t(i) are calculated, respectively, and the nearest one is taken as the packing position of the item i according to the principle “the least distance to the mass center”, and store the related information inLcandLr, respectively. So, until the item t(n) is positioned, a packing scheme have been constructed.Note: (i) The standing column of the satellite module is taken as a circle whose center is set at the origin. (ii) For each candidate position of item 6 shown in Fig. 6(b), if there exists a gap between it and adjacent items (such as item 5), its position will be adjusted to eliminate the gap (see Fig. 6(c)).LetYopt be the optimal packing scheme calculated by the heuristic ACO. In generally, in the periphery region ofYopt, there probably exist the items (items 2–4 in Fig. 7(a)) whose positions and directions can be further adjusted to obtainYpwith a smaller enveloping radius (see Fig. 7(b)). Inspired by the quasi-physical approaches [38,39], a local adjustment strategy will be presented in this Subsection.Definition 1Let dc(i,j) denote the embedding degree between two circles i and j whose centers and radii are (xi,yi,ri) and (xj,yj,rj), respectively, then d c(i,j)=max (0, ri+rj−dij), where dij=((xi−xj)2+(yi−yj)2)½.Let dc(o,i) denote the embedding degree between the circle i and the circular container whose centers and radii are (xi,yi,ri) and (0,0,R0), then dc(o,i)=max (0, ri+(xi2 +yi2)½−R0).Let drc(i,j) denote the embedding degree between the circle i and rectangle j, (xi,yi) and ribe the center and radius of the circle i, respectively. Suppose that A1 is the vertex of the rectangle j whose distance to the center (xi,yi) is the nearest. If there is a straight line l through A1 separating them (see Fig. 8(a) and (b)), then drc(i,j)=0; otherwise, drc(i,j)=ri−ŕdij. Here, dijis the distance from the circular center (xi,yi) to the straight line l, ŕ=1 when (xi,yi) is not in the rectangle j or ŕ=−1when (xi,yi) is in the rectangle j (see Fig. 8(c) and (d)).Let dr(i,j) denote the embedding degree between two rectangles i and j whose centers and placement angles are (xi,yi), αiand (xj,yj), αj, respectively. Suppose that B1 is the vertex of the rectangle i whose distance to the center (xi,yi) of the rectangle j is the nearest. If there is a straight line l through A1 separating them (see Fig. 9(a)), then dr(i,j)=0; otherwise, dr(i,j)=rj−ŕdij(see Fig. 9(b)). Here, dijis the distance of the center (xj,yj) to the straight line l, ŕ=1 when (xi,yi) is not in the rectangle j or ŕ=−1when (xi,yi) is in the rectangle j.The center and radius of the container are (0,0) and R0, respectively. The center, length, width and placed angle of the rectangle j are (xj,yj), aj, bjand αj, respectively. Let dr(o,i) denote the embedding degree between the container and rectangle j. Then dr(o,i)=max(0, dmax- R0), where dmaxis the maximal value of distances from four vertices of the rectangle j to the container center, respectively (see Fig. 10).Inspired by López and Beasley and Xu and Dong [36,37], the following Formula (23) is given to calculate the elastic potential energy of the layout schemeYpfor the circle and rectangle packing problem based on Definitions 1–5.(23)U(Yp)=∑i=1ξpdc(o,i)2+∑j=1ζpdr(o,j)2+∑i=1,i≠jξp∑j=1ξpdc(i,j)2+∑i=1ξp∑j=1ζpdrc(i,j)2+∑i=1,i≠jζp∑j=1ζpdr(i,j)2where dr(o,j) is related to the placed angle αjof the rectangle j.To obtainYpquickly, the fast gradient method is described as follows, where R0=0.8Ropt and R1=0.8R0 andYp(0)=Yopt andYp(k) by Formula (24). After 50 times of iteration, if U(Yp(k))=0, then R0=R1; otherwise, R1=0.5(R1+R0). Repeat the above process, until |R1−R0|≤ε1.(24)Ypk+1=Ypk+μ▽U(Xpk),xi=xi−μ∂U∂xi,yi=yi−μ∂U∂yi,αi=αi−μ∂U∂αiwhere μ=0.01,▽U(Yp(k))=(∂U/∂xi, ∂U/∂yi, ∂U/∂αi) is calculated by Formulas (a_1)–(a_6) in Appendix A.Let Ři(i=1,2, …, ξp) and Či(i=ξp+1, ξp+2, …, ξp+ζp) denote the circumscribing rectangle of the circle Ciand the circumcircle of rectangle Rj, respectively. Let N2 be the maximal iterative number and M2 be the number of ants, then the proposed LAHACO is illustrated by the following procedure, where an Ant_Pack program unit is used to construct a packing scheme by the single artificial ant.Suppose that a distribution P1–P4 of ξ+ζ components has been found according to Section 3 and the vector of z coordinates of their centers isZ={z1, z2, …, zξ+ζ}. LetYpi(i=1,2,3,4) be solutions of four bearing surfaces calculated by the proposed LAHACO, thenX=∪4i=1Ypi⊕Z, where⊕ denotes the vector addition. Because f1(X)=0, f2(X) and ||J(X)||1 get to their respective optimal values. So, for a current task, it is vital that on the premise of keeping them from changing, all f3(X)–f7(X) are optimized to get their respective minimal values. Let |Āi|=(fi32+fi42)1/2 (i=1,2,3,4) be the static imbalance ofYpi. Suppose that |Ā1|–|Ā4| are sorted from small to large (see Fig. 11(a)). If |Ā4|≤|Ā1|+|Ā2|+|Ā3|, both f3(X) and f4(X) can be reduced to 0 (see Fig. 11(b)) by rotating four bearing surfaces around z axis.PSO has better local optimization ability [34]. For making all the mass center error (f3(X), f4(X)) and three inertia angles θx′(X), θy′(X) and θx′(X) smaller as possible. The PSO-based method is used to solve above problem. (i) SetX1(0)=∪4i=1Ypi⊕ZandXi(0)=∪4j=1Ypj(φij)⊕Z(i=2,3,..,M3). Here,Ypj(φij) (j=1,2,3,4) is obtained by rotatingYpjthe angleφijround z axis counterclockwise. Setgi(0)=Xi(0) (i=1,2, …, M3),q(0)=Xbest(0) and t=1. (ii) If a termination criterion is satisfied, thenXopt=Xbest(t−1), otherwise,φi(t) andXi(t) (i=1,2,..,M3) are calculated by Formulas (25) and (26). (iii) f3(Xi(t)), f4(Xi(t)), θx'(Xi(t)), θy'(Xi(t)), θz'(Xi(t)) and F(Xi(t)) (i=1, 2, ., M3) are calculated by Formulas (2), (3) and (27), respectively; letgi(t) (i=1, 2,…, M3) be the best one ofXi(1),Xi(2), …,Xi(t) andq(t) be the best one ofXbest(1),Xbest(2), …,Xbest(t); set t=t+1. Repeat (ii)–(iii), until meeting the termination criterion or reaching the maximal number N3 of iterations.(25)ωi(t)P=λωi(t−1)P+cc1(gi(t−1)P−Xi(t−1)P)+cc2(qi(t−1)P−Xi(t−1)P)(26)Xi(t)P=Xi(t)P+ωi(t)P(27)F(Xi(t))=π1(|f3(Xi(t))|+|f4(Xi(t))|)+π2(|θx'(Xi(t))|+|θy'(Xi(t))|+|θz'(Xi(t))|)Here cc1, cc2 and λ are three positive numbers and 0<λ<1. By debugging program, take cc1=1.49445, cc2=1.49445, π1=1, π2=12, λ=0.618 in Section 6.Based on the discussion in Sections 3–5, the proposed HMMOA is described as follows.
