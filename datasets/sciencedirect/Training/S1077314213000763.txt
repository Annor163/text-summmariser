@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Precise segmentation and identification of thoracic vertebrae is important for many medical imaging applications though it remains challenging due to the vertebra’s complex shape and varied neighboring structures. In this paper, a new method based on learned bone-structure edge detectors and a coarse-to-fine deformable surface model is proposed to segment and identify vertebrae in 3D CT thoracic images. In the training stage, a discriminative classifier for object-specific edge detection is trained using steerable features and statistical shape models for 12 thoracic vertebrae are also learned. For the run-time testing, we design a new coarse-to-fine, two-stage segmentation strategy: subregions of a vertebra first deform together as a group; then vertebra mesh vertices in a smaller neighborhood move group-wise to progressively drive the deformable model towards edge response maps by optimizing a probability cost function. In this manner, the smoothness and topology of vertebrae shapes are guaranteed. This algorithm performs successfully with reliable mean point-to-surface errors 0.95±0.91mm on 40 volumes. Consequently a vertebra identification scheme is also proposed via mean surface mesh matching. We achieve a success rate of 73.1% using a single vertebra, and over 95% for 8 or more vertebra which is comparable or slightly better than state-of-the-art [5].

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A precise vertebra segmentation and identification method is in high demand due to its importance in many orthopaedic, neurological and oncological applications. In this paper, we focus on thoracic vertebra where accurate segmentation and identification can directly eliminate false findings on lung nodules in computer aided diagnosis (Lung CAD) system [14,25,6]. However, this task remains challenging due to the significant complexity of vertebrae, i.e., within-class shape variation and different neighboring structures. An illustration of our motivation is shown in Fig. 1.Several methods have been reported addressing segmentation and/or identification of vertebra under different modalities [24,17,4,13,15,5], e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Yao et al. [24] present a method to automatically extract and partition the spinal cord in CT images, and a surface-based registration approach for automatic lumbar vertebra identification is described in [4], where no identification was carried out in either work. A hierarchical 3D segmentation method of the lumbar spine in CT images with the definition of vertebral body coordinate systems is described in [13]. In [15], Peng et al. propose a vertebra detection and segmentation algorithm processing 2D slices of MRI images, instead of the 3D volume as a whole. Recently, Klinder et al. [5] propose a model-based solution for vertebra detection, segmentation and identification in CT images. They achieved very competitive identification rates of >70% for a single vertebra and 100% for 16 or more vertebrae. However, their identification algorithm is based on vertebrae active appearance model (i.e., an averaged intensity volume block) for spatial registration and matching which is very computationally expensive (20–30min).In this paper, we present a new automatic vertebra segmentation and identification method. Although this work mainly focuses on thoracic vertebra (for potential lung applications), our approach can be easily extended to cervical and lumbar vertebrae. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, we introduce a learning based bone structure edge detection algorithm, including efficient and effective gradient steerable features and robust training data sampling. Second, we propose a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine deformable surface based segmentation method based on the response maps from the learned edge detector, followed with an efficient vertebra identification method using mean shapes. Finally, promising results of both segmentation and identification are presented, compared with the state-of-the-art [5]. An earlier version of this paper appears in [11].
