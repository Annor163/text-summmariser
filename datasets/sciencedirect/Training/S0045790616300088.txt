@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the development of transistor technology, hundreds and even thousands of cores are going to be integrated in a single Chip Multi-processor (CMP) [2]. The efficiency of communication between cores depends on many factors, which has become a critical problem in the design of high-performance CMPs [3]. Traditional bus-based interconnection approaches cannot provide enough bandwidth, and thus is only suitable to deal with communication among a handful of cores. To overcome the drawback of bus interconnection, Network-on-Chips (NoCs) have been proposed as a promising solution to address the challenges of on-chip multi-core processor design [4,5]. In NoCs, each tile can be an implementation of processors, DSP blocks, memory blocks, and other embedded reconfiguration modules [7]. Then the regular tiles are connected into a network with a certain topology such as mesh, torus, etc. [6]. NoCs is a flexible and scalable interconnection architecture that can connect over hundred and even thousands of cores. The throughput and bandwidth of NoCs are far larger than traditional buses, e.g., Intel Teraflop 80-core and Tilera 64-core [9], have gained large bandwidth by using NoCs. Also NoC has the advantage of lower power consumption in comparison with bus-based interconnections [4,8].In CMPs different cores need to exchange data with each other frequently. Hence, the performance of a CMP heavily depends on the underlying packet routing scheme. Communications in NoCs can be classified into unicast (one-to-one) traffic or multicast (one-to-many) traffic [10]. The support of multicast communication in NoCs is particularly important for applications such as reduction, permutation, segmented scan, replication [12], barrier synchronization [11], clock synchronization, multithreading programs, and cache coherence protocols of distributed shared-memory architectures in CMPs [13]. Traditional multicast routing schemes simply use multiple unicasts to realize a multicast, which is not efficient since a multicast packet with N destinations needs N unicast packets. The lack of efficient multicast routing support has become a bottleneck for NoCs since multicast traffic has a significant impact on the performance of NoCs [14].In this paper, we proposed a new adaptive partition-based multicast routing algorithm without routing table for mesh-based NoCs based on the LADPM scheme proposed in [1]. Although LADPM is a novel and efficient approach to route multicast traffic, it lacks adaptation to traffic load. For each multicast packet, a router in LADPM provides only one output port and ignores buffer state and traffic condition of the downstream neighbor routers, which can lead to significant performance degradation under heavy traffic load. The basic principle of our scheme is to route each multicast packet to the corresponding port based on the relative position of each destination node. When there are more than one available routing paths without causing misrouting, the router makes routing decisions adaptively from these candidate ports based on the buffer state of the downstream routers. Simulation shows that, in an 8Ã—8 2D-mesh network under high injection rates, our scheme can reduce the end-to-end communication delay by 43% and 54% in comparison with LADPM when the number of destination nodes is set to 8 and 4, respectively.The initial idea of our routing algorithm was published in [15]. In this paper, most constraints on adaptive routing has been removed to achieve better adaptivity, and we further added new contributions that include (a) an efficient algorithm for routing multicast traffic using recursive partition; (b) a novel and easy method for minimizing the link usage of a multicast tree; and (c) a minimal adaptive routing algorithm that can balance multicast traffic load.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the related work and the background of multicast routing in NoCs. The proposed multicast routing algorithm is presented in detail in Section 3. The simulation results and the comparison with previous work are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.
