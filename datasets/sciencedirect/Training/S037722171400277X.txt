@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Subgroup additivity requires that a rule assigns the same expected ‘relative’ utility to each agent whether an agent’s expected relative utility is calculated from the problem involving all agents or from its sub-problems with a smaller number of agents. In this paper, we investigate its implications for the queueing problem. As a result, we present characterizations of five important rules: the minimal transfer rule, the maximal transfer rule, the pivotal rule, the reward based pivotal rule, and the symmetrically balanced VCG rule. In addition to some basic axioms and subgroup additivity, the characterization results can be obtained by additionally imposing either a strategic axiom or an equity axiom.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The queueing problem has the following set-up. There is a group of agents who must be served in a facility.1In this paper, we assume that there is no initial queue. For models with an initial queue, see, for example, Curiel, Pederzoli, and Tijs (1989), Borm, Fiestras-Janeiro, Hamers, Sanchez, and Voorneveld (2002), Hamers, Klijn, and van Velzen (2005), van Velzen (2006), Grundel, Çiftçi, Borm, and Hamers (2013).1The facility can serve only one agent at a time and agents incur waiting costs. We are interested in finding the order in which to serve agents and the (positive or negative) monetary transfers they should receive. We assume that the waiting cost is constant per unit of time, but that agents differ in their waiting costs. Furthermore, we assume that agents have quasi-linear preference and, in particular, the utility of an agent is the amount of his monetary transfer minus his waiting costs. The queueing problem (and its generalization with non-identical processing time called sequencing problems) has been analyzed extensively from a strategic perspective (Dolan, 1978; Suijs, 1996; Mitra, 2001; Mitra, 2002 and others) as well as from a normative perspective (Maniquet, 2003; Chun, 2006a; Chun, 2006b; Chun, 2011 and others).2A similar analysis can be done for scheduling problems in which agents have the same waiting costs, but the processing time for jobs can differ (see, for example, Cres & Moulin, 2001; Moulin, 2007).2The axiom ofs-subgroup additivity requires that a rule assigns the same expected relative utility to each agent whether an agent’s expected relative utility is calculated from the problem involving allnagents or from its sub-problems withsagents where the sub-problems are formed from the original set ofnagents. The relative utility of an agent from a rule (and given a group) is the utility of the agent in a given state relative to his identical expected utility (that is, utility that he expects to derive when all others’ preference coincides with his and he gets each of the queue position with equal probability). We investigate its implications for the queueing problem. As a result, we present characterizations of five important rules in the queueing problem: the minimal transfer rule (Maniquet, 2003), the maximal transfer rule (Chun, 2006a), the pivotal rule, the reward based pivotal rule (Mitra & Mutuswami, 2011), and the symmetrically balanced VCG rule (Suijs, 1996; Kayi & Ramaekers, 2010).3Here VCG rule is due to Vickrey (1961), Clarke (1971), and Groves (1973).3Our notion of subgroup additivity can be compared with converse consistency, which requires that if, whenever for some problem a feasible alternative has the property that for all proper subgroups of agents the solution chooses the restriction of the alternative to the subgroup for the associated reduced problem this subgroup faces, then the alternative should be the solution for the problem. The most common form of converse consistency is defined for 2 agent problems. Converse consistency is appealing from both practical and computational point of views as it tells us that to evaluate an outcome for some possibly large group, it is enough to do so at the two-agent level (Peleg, 1986; Thomson, 2004). We ask a related question: Is it possible to solve then-agent problem by solving sub-problems with 2 or 3 agents? Instead of introducing a reduced problem, we try to find an answer by solving sub-problems directly obtained from the original problem. Also, we note that subgroup additivity is an important issue in other contexts such as poverty measures and has been studied extensively under the name of decomposability (Foster, Greer, & Thorbecke, 1984).In this paper, first, we show that, given any set ofnagents, for eachs∈{2,…,n-2}, if a rule satisfiess-subgroup additivity, queue efficiency, Pareto indifference and equal treatment of equals, then it also satisfies(s+1)-subgroup additivity implying that 2-subgroup additivity is the strongest requirement among the class of rules satisfying queue efficiency, Pareto indifference and equal treatment of equals. Using 2-subgroup additivity, we provide characterizations of the minimal transfer rule, the maximal transfer rule, the pivotal rule and the reward based pivotal rule. By using 3-subgroup additivity, we provide characterizations of the symmetrically balanced VCG rule.Given the subgroup additivity axiom and some basic axioms like queue efficiency, equal treatment of equals, and Pareto indifference, we impose additionally two types of axioms to characterize these five rules. The first type of axioms are strategic where we weaken the notion of strategyproofness. Strategyproofness requires that truth-telling is a dominant strategy for all agents in all announced states. The second type of axioms are equity-based, where we strengthen the notion of egalitarian equivalence. Egalitarian equivalence requires that all agents are indifferent between his allocated bundle and a reference bundle (Pazner & Schmeidler, 1978). We adjust this notion of egalitarian equivalence by imposing a restriction on the reference bundle. What comes out of our analysis is that each strategic axiom in our characterization results can be replaced by an appropriate equity axiom for the four rules that are 2-additive. This type of substitutability between strategic and equity axioms also works for the symmetrically balanced VCG rule.The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide the preliminaries that include the structure of the queueing problem, the basic axioms, and the five rules important of our analysis. In Section 3 we present our main axiom of subgroup additivity, highlight its important properties, and show that all the five rules satisfy some version of this property. In Section 4 we provide our characterization result of the four 2-subgroup additive rules using strategic properties, and in Section 5 using equity properties. In Section 6 we characterize the symmetrically balanced VCG rule using 3-subgroup additivity along with either a strategic axiom or an equity axiom. In Section 7 we conclude our analysis.LetI≡{1,2,…}be an (infinite) universe of “potential” agents, and letNbe the family of non-empty subsets ofI. Each agenti∈Iis characterized by his unit waiting cost,θi>0. GivenN∈N, each agenti∈Nis assigned a positionσi∈{1,…,|N|}in a queue and a transferti∈R.4For any setA,|A|denotes the cardinality ofA.4If agenti∈Nis served in theσith position, his waiting cost is(σi-1)θi. Hence the agent who is served first incurs no waiting cost. Each agenti∈Nhas a quasi-linear preference so that his utility from the bundle(σi,ti)is given byui(σi,ti;θi)=ti-(σi-1)θiwhen his waiting cost isθi.A queueing problem is defined as a listθN≡(θi)i∈NwhereN∈Nis the set of agents andθNis the vector of unit waiting costs. LetQNbe the class of all problems forNandQ=∪N∈NQN.An allocation forθN∈Qis a pair(σ,t),where for eachi∈N,σidenotes agenti’s position in the queue andtithe monetary transfer to him. An allocation is feasible if no two agents are assigned the same position. Given any non-empty coalitionS⊆N, a queue for the set of agents inScan be represented by a permutation ofS, that is by a bijectionσ:{1,…,|S|}→S. The elements ofσ(·)are simply a reordering of the elements ofS. For each non-emptyS⊆N, letΠ(S)be the set of all permutations ofS. Thus, the set of feasible allocationsZ(θN)consists of all pairs(σ,t)∈Π(N)×R|N|.GivenθN∈QN,an allocation(σ,t)∈Z(θN)is queue-efficient if it minimizes the total waiting cost, that is, for all(σ′,t′)∈Z(θN),∑i∈N(σi-1)θi⩽∑i∈N(σi′-1)θi. The efficient queue of a problem does not depend on the transfers. Moreover, it is unique except for agents with equal waiting costs, who will be next to each other in the queue and can be permuted. The set of queue efficient allocations forθN∈QNis denoted byEFF(θN). Also, an allocation(σ,t)∈Z(θN)is budget balanced if∑i∈Nti=0. A rule is a mappingφ:Q→Z(θN)which associates with each problemθN∈QNa non-empty subsetφ(θN)of feasible allocations. The pairφi(θN)=(σi(θN),ti(θN))represents the position ofiin the queue and his transfer inθN. GivenθN∈QN,(σ,t)∈Z(θN),andi∈N,letPi(σ)be the set of agents preceding agenti, that isPi(σ)={j∈N|σj<σi}. Similarly letFi(σ)the set of agents following him, that isFi(σ)={j∈N|σj>σi}.We introduce basic axioms on the rules. Queue efficiency requires that the rule should choose an efficient allocation. Budget balance requires that the sum of all transfers should be equal to zero. Pareto efficiency requires that the rule should choose an allocation which is queue efficient and budget balanced. Pareto indifference requires that if an allocation is chosen by a rule, then all other feasible allocations which assign the same utilities to each agent should be chosen by the rule. Equal treatment of equals requires that two agents with the same waiting cost should end up with the same utilities. Finally, for any given positive integers, s-equal treatment of equals requires that equal treatment of equals holds for all s agent problems.Definition 2.1A ruleφis queue efficient (EFF) if for allN∈N,allθN∈QN,and all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),σ∈EFF(θN).A ruleφis budget balanced (BB) if for allN∈N,allθN∈QN, and all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),∑i∈Nti=0.A ruleφis Pareto efficient (PEFF) if for allN∈N,allθN∈QN,and all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),σ∈EFF(θN)and∑i∈Nti=0.A ruleφsatisfies Pareto indifference (PI) if for allN∈N, allθN∈QN,all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),and(σ′,t′)∈Z(θN),ifσ′∈EFF(θN)and for alli∈N,ui(σi′,ti′;θi)=ui(σi,ti;θi),then(σ′,t′)∈φ(θN).A ruleφsatisfies equal treatment of equals (ETE) if for allN∈N, allθN∈QN,and alli,j∈Nsuch thatθi=θj,if(σ,t)∈φ(θN),thenui(σi,ti;θi)=uj(σj,tj;θj).A weakening of ETE is to requires-ETE which requires the rule to satisfy equal treatment of equals for all problems with exactlysagents.Definition 2.6A ruleφsatisfiess-equal treatment of equals (s-ETE) if for allN∈Nwith|N|=s, allθN∈QN,and alli,j∈Nsuch thatθi=θj,if(σ,t)∈φ(θN),thenui(σi,ti;θi)=uj(σj,tj;θj).We characterize five rules that have been well studied in the queueing literature. The minimal transfer rule (Maniquet, 2003) selects an efficient queue and transfers to each agent a half of his unit waiting cost multiplied by the number of his predecessors minus a half of the sum of the unit waiting cost of his successors. The maximal transfer rule (Chun, 2006a) selects an efficient queue and transfers to each agent a half of the sum of the unit waiting cost of his predecessors minus a half of his unit waiting cost multiplied by the number of his successors. These two rules are obtained by applying the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953), one of the most widely discussed solution in cooperative games, to appropriately designed cooperative games of the queueing problem. For the minimal transfer rule, the worth of a coalition is defined to be the minimal waiting cost incurred by its members under the assumption that they are served before the non-coalitional members. For the maximal transfer rule, the members of the coalition are served after the non-coalitional members.Definition 2.7The minimal transfer ruleφMis such that for allN∈N, allθN∈QN,and all(σ,tM)∈φM(θN),σ∈EFF(θN)and for alli∈N,(2.1)tiM(θN)=(σi-1)θi2-∑s∈Fi(σ)θs2.The maximal transfer ruleφCis such that for allN∈N, allθN∈QN,and all(σ,tC)∈φC(θN),σ∈EFF(θN)and for alli∈N,(2.2)tiC(θN)=∑p∈Pi(σ)θp2-(|N|-σi)θi2.The next three rules satisfy strategyproofness, that is, truth telling is a dominant strategy for each agent and for each (announced) state. The first rule, which can be called the symmetrically balanced VCG rule, was first obtained in the context of sequencing by Suijs (1996) and later characterized, in the queueing context by Kayi and Ramaekers (2010).Definition 2.9The symmetrically balanced VCG ruleφGis such that for allN∈Nwith|N|⩾3,allθN∈QN,and all(σ,tG)∈φG(θN),σ∈EFF(θN)and for alli∈N,(2.3)tiG(θN)=∑p∈Pi(σ)σp-1|N|-2θp-∑s∈Fi(σ)|N|-σs|N|-2θs.The next two rules fail to satisfy PEFF but are nevertheless important primarily because these rules satisfy weak group strategyproof, that is these rules are immune to group deviation provided there is no further side payments across agents.Definition 2.10The pivotal ruleφpis such that for allN∈N,allθN∈QN,and all(σ,tp)∈φp(θN),σ∈EFF(θN)and for alli∈N,(2.4)tip(θN)=-∑s∈Fi(σ)θs.The reward-based pivotal ruleφris such that for allN∈N,allθN∈QN,and all(σ,tr)∈φr(θN),σ∈EFF(θN)and for alli∈N,(2.5)tir(θN)=∑p∈Pi(σ)θp.There is a class of mechanisms, calledk-pivotal mechanisms, that were characterized by Mitra and Mutuswami (2011) using EFF, ETE, pairwise strategyproofness and weak linearity. While weak linearity is a technical requirement, the axiom of pairwise strategyproofness states that, as long as there is no further side payments across agents, there does not exist any pair of agents that can benefit by deviating from truth-telling. Moreover, allk-pivotal mechanisms are weakly group strategyproof, which requires that any subgroup of agents can not be made strictly better off by deviating. The pivotal and the reward based pivotal rules belong to the class ofk-pivotal mechanisms. We leave out otherk-pivotal mechanisms simply because these mechanisms fail to satisfy the kind of subgroup additivity that we are introducing in this paper.From the discussion of this subsection it is clear that all five rulesφM,φC,φG,φpandφrhave either a normative justification or a strategic justification or both. In the next section we introduce subgroup additivity and we also study certain properties of subgroup additive rules by restricting our analysis to the class of all rules satisfying the three basic axioms of EFF, PI and ETE (ors-ETE). This class is not that restrictive in this context since all the five rules satisfy EFF, PI and ETE (and hences-ETE).Remark 2.12One advantage of having a ruleφsatisfying EFF, PI and ETE (ors-ETE) is that we can, without loss of generality, select any efficient allocation from the set of all feasible allocations in a given problem. In particular, suppose that for someθN∈QN,there existsi,j∈Nsuch thatθi=θj. Ifσ∈EFF(θN),then the queueσ′obtained by interchanging the queue positions of agentsiandj, ceteris paribus, also belongs toEFF(θN). By ETE (or appropriates-ETE) we get if(σ,t)∈φ(θN)thenui(σi,ti;θi)=uj(σj,tj;θj). Consider the transfert′obtained fromtby interchanging the transfers of agentsiandj, ceteris paribus. Givenθi=θj, by PI,(σ′,t′)∈φ(θN). Hence we haveui(σi,ti;θi)=ui(σj,tj;θi)anduj(σi,ti;θj)=uj(σj,tj;θj)implying that, given any problem, each agent receives identical utility at any efficient allocation of the problem.Given Remark 2.12, for simplicity of exposition of the next section, we use the following notation: For any given ruleφsatisfying the three basic axioms of EFF, PI and appropriates-ETE, anyN∈Nand anyθN∈QNwith(σ,t)∈φ(θN),ui(σi,ti;θi)≡Ui(θN)=Ui(θi,θN⧹{i}).In general, it is more difficult to solve a problem involving all agents than solving several problems with smaller numbers of agents and hence it is always helpful to look for rules that are subgroup additive. Before going to the formal definition we introduce some relevant definitions and concepts. For any non-empty setSof agents and anyk∈{1,…,|S|}, defineT(S;k)={S′⊆S||S′|=k}. ThusT(S;k)is the collection of all possible subsets ofSof sizekand hence|T(S;k)|=|S|k. Given anyi∈Nand any setS⊆N⧹{i}of agents with|S|=k, let the identical expected utility of an agentiwith waiting costθi>0beIEU(θi,k+1)=(k/2)θi. Thus, in a problem withk+1agents that includes agentiwith waiting costθi, if all other agents had the same waiting cost asithen the identical expected utility of agentiis the cost that he incurs if he gets each of thek+1queue positions with equal probability1/(k+1). Define the relative utility of agentiin stateθS∪{i}=(θi,θS)asU‾i(θi,θS)=Ui(θi,θS)/IEU(θi,|S∪{i}|). Therefore,U‾i(θi,θS)is the ratio of the actual utility and the identical expected utility. For anyN, anyi∈Nand anys∈{2,…,|N⧹{i}|},Ei(θN|s)=(1/|T(N⧹{i};s-1)|)∑S′∈T(N⧹{i};s-1)U‾i(θS′∪{i}). Therefore,Ei(θN|s)is the expected relative utility of agentifrom all possible allocations with subgroups of agents of sizes(which always includes agenti) where the probability of selection of each subgroup of sizes-1from the set ofN⧹{i}agents is equally likely. A ruleφiss-subgroup additive if for any givenN∈Nwith|N|>s, eachi∈N, eachθN∈QN,(3.1)Ei(θN||N|)=Ei(θN|s).Using the definition of relative utility we can simplify each term in condition (3.1) to obtain the following:(3.2)Ei(θN|s)=1|N|-1s-1∑S′∈T(N⧹{i};s-1)Ui(θi,θS′)-(s-1)(θi/2)=-1(θi/2)(|N|-1)|N|-2s-2∑S′∈T(N⧹{i};s-1)Ui(θi,θS′),and(3.3)Ei(θN||N|)=1|N|-1|N|-1Ui(θN)-(|N|-1)θi/2=-Ui(θN)(|N|-1)(θi/2).Equating conditions (3.3) and (3.2) and then simplifying it we obtain(3.4)Ui(θN)=1|N|-2s-2∑S′∈T(N⧹{i};s-1)Ui(θi,θS′).Using condition (3.4) we can re-write the definition ofs-subgroup additivity in the following way.Definition 3.1Given any positive integers, a ruleφiss-subgroup additive if for any givenN∈Nwith|N|>s,allθN∈QN,and alli∈N,(3.5)Ui(θN)=1|N|-2s-2∑S⊆N⧹{i},|S|=s-1Ui(θi,θS).One can make a comparison between subgroup additivity and converse consistency. Suppose that we want to assign utilities to each agent by solvings(<n)-agent problems instead of solving ann-agent problem. If a rule satisfiess-subgroup additivity, then each agentiwill end up with the same utility whether ann-agent problem is solved or whether we take an appropriately weighted sum of all the utilities assigned to thisi-th agent in alls-agent problems that includes him. As in the case of converse consistency, subgroup additivity provides a way of finding an allocation for then-agent problem by focussing on problems with a smaller number of agents. However, the difference between converse consistency and subgroup additivity comes from the difference in the initial situation and in the nature of aggregation. For converse consistency we start with then-agent problem and we look at the desirability of a feasible alternative simply by looking at the restriction ons-agent problem that results when all but thesesagents have left with their components. This is different from subgroup additivity where the starting point is thes-agent problems and the weighted additivity aspect takes us to then-agent problem.We first investigate the relation between subgroup additivity axioms with different sizes of subgroups.Proposition 3.3Letφbe a rule satisfying EFF, PI ands-ETE. If the ruleφsatisfiess-subgroup additivity withs∈{2,…,|N|-2},then it also satisfies(s+1)-subgroup additivity.If a ruleφsatisfies EFF, PI ands-ETE and is alsos-subgroup additive, then for any givenN∈Nwith|N|≡n>s, allθN∈QNand alli∈N,Ui(θN)=1n-2s-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1Ui(θi,θS). Ifs∈{2,…,n-2}we also haveUi(θN)=1n-2s-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1Ui(θi,θS)=1n-2s-1∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1n-ss-1Ui(θi,θS)=1n-2s-1∑S′⊂N⧹{i},|S′|=s∑j∈S′Ui(θi,θS′⧹{j})s-1=1n-2s-1∑S′⊂N⧹{i},|S′|=s∑j∈S′-σiθi,θS′⧹{j}-1θi+tiθi,θS′⧹{j}s-1=1n-2s-1∑S′⊂N⧹{i},|S′|=s-σiθi,θS′-1θi+∑j∈S′tiθi,θS′⧹{j}s-1=1n-2s-1∑S′⊂N⧹{i},|S′|=sUi(θi,θS′).Therefore we have(s+1)-subgroup additivity. The last step follows by defining the transferti(θi,θS′)≡(1/(s-1))∑j∈S′tiθi,θS′⧹{j}for eachS′⊂N⧹{i}with|S′|=s. Finally, the penultimate step follows by noting that for anyS′⊂N⧹{i}with|S′|=s,∑j∈S′σiθi,θS′⧹{j}-1θis-1=∑j∈Pi(σ(θi,θS′))σiθi,θS′-2θis-1+∑j∈Fi(σ(θi,θS′))σiθi,θS′-1θis-1=σiθi,θS′-1σiθi,θS′-2θis-1+s-σiθi,θS′+1σiθi,θS′-1θis-1=σiθi,θS′-1σiθi,θS′-2θis-1+(s-1)-σiθi,θS′-2σiθi,θS′-1θis-1=σiθi,θS′-1θi.□Proposition 3.3 ensures that if a ruleφsatisfies EFF, PI ands-ETE, then 2-subgroup additivity is the strongest, which implies 3-subgroup additivity, and so on. The next proposition shows that if a rule satisfies EFF, PI ands-ETE, then it iss-subgroup additive if and only if its transfer iss-subgroup additive.Proposition 3.4Letφbe a rule satisfying EFF, PI ands-ETE. The rule iss-subgroup additive if and only if the transfers ares-subgroup additive, that is for any givenN∈Nwith|N|>s, allθN∈QN,and alli∈N,(3.6)ti(θN)=1|N|-2s-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1ti(θi,θS).If a ruleφiss-subgroup additive then given anyN∈Nwith|N|≡n>s, allθN∈QNand alli∈N,Ui(θi,θN⧹{i})=1n-2s-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1Ui(θi,θS)⇔-σiθN-1θi+ti(θN)=-1n-2s-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1σiθi,θS-1θi+1n-2s-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1ti(θi,θS)⇔ti(θN)-1n-2s-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1ti(θi,θS)=σiθN-1θi-1n-2s-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1σiθi,θS-1θi.Given the last step, to show condition (3.6) we show that if the ruleφiss-subgroup additive and it also satisfies EFF, PI ands-ETE, then (A)(σi(θN)-1)θi=1n-2n-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1(σi(θi,θS)-1)θi. Ifσi(θN)=1,then by EFF, PI ands-ETE, we can find an allocation under the rule such thatPi(σ(θN))=Pi(σ(θi,θS))=∅for allS⊆N⧹{i}and we haveσi(θi,θS)=1for allS⊆N⧹{i}implying that condition (A) holds. If|PiσθN|=σi(θN)-1∈{1,…,n-1}, then1n-2s-2∑S⊂N⧹{i},|S|=s-1(σi(θi,θS)-1)θi=1n-2s-2∑r=max{0,s-1-(n-σi(θN))}σi(θN)-1rσi(θN)-1rn-σi(θN)s-1-rθi=(σi(θN)-1)n-2s-2∑r=max{0,s-1-(n-σi(θN))}+1σi(θN)-1σi(θN)-2r-1n-σi(θN)s-1-rθi=(σi(θN)-1)n-2s-2n-2s-2θi=(σi(θN)-1)θi.Thus (A) holds.□Proposition 3.4 will be helpful in deriving the next proposition.Proposition 3.5The rulesφM,φC,φpandφrare all 2-subgroup additive. The ruleφGis 3-subgroup additive.Observe that all the rulesφM,φC,φp,φr,andφGsatisfy EFF, PI, and ETE. Hence to verify subgroup additivity of these five rules all we need do is to check the restriction on transfer given in condition (3.6) of Proposition 3.4. In particular, to verify 2-subgroup additivity of a ruleφ,we need to check whether for anyN∈Nsuch that|N|>2, anyθN∈QNand anyi∈N,ti(θN)=∑j∈N⧹{i}ti(θi,θj). To prove 2-subgroup additivity ofφM,φC,φpandφr, we assume, without loss of generality, that ifp∈Pi(σ(θN)),thenp∈Pi(σ(θi,θp)),and ifs∈Fi(σ(θN)),thens∈Fi(σ(θi,θs))(see Remark 2.12). Similarly, to verify 3-subgroup additivity of a ruleφ,we need to check whether for any givenN∈Nwith|N|>3, allθN∈QN,and alli∈N,ti(θN)=(1/(|N|-2))∑{j,l}⊂N⧹{i}ti(θi,θ{j,l}). Again to prove 3-subgroup additivity ofφG, we assume, without loss of generality, that ifp∈Pi(σ(θN)),thenp∈Pi(σ(θi,θp,θl))for alll∈N⧹{p,i},and ifs∈Fi(σ(θN)),thens∈Fi(σ(θi,θs,θl))for alll∈N⧹{p,i}(see Remark 2.12).Consider first the minimum transfer ruleφM. Observe that forN={i,j}withi,j∈I,tiM(θi,θj)=-tjM(θj,θi)=-(θj/2)ifσi(θi,θj)=1. Therefore, for anyN∈Nsuch that|N|>2, anyθN∈QNand anyi∈N, it follows thattiM(θN)=(σi(θN)-1)θi2-∑s∈Fi(σ(θN))θs2=∑p∈Pi(σ(θN))tiM(θi,θp)+∑s∈Fi(σ(θN))tiM(θi,θs)=∑j∈N⧹{i}tiM(θi,θj).Hence from the last step we obtain 2-subgroup additivity forφM.For the maximum transfer ruleφCwithN={i,j}andi,j∈I, we havetiC(θi,θj)=-tjC(θj,θi)=-(θi/2)ifσi(θi,θj)=1. Therefore, for anyN∈Nsuch that|N|>2, anyθN∈QNand anyi∈N, one can verify thattiC(θN)=∑p∈Pi(σ(θN))θp2-(|N|-σi(θN))θi2=∑p∈Pi(σ(θN))tiC(θi,θp)+∑s∈Fi(σ(θN))tiC(θi,θs)=∑j∈N⧹{i}tiC(θi,θj).Hence from the last step we obtain 2-subgroup additivity forφC.For the pivotal ruleφpwithN={i,j}andi,j∈I, we havetip(θi,θj)=-θjifσi(θi,θj)=1andtip(θi,θj)=0ifσi(θi,θj)=2. Therefore, for anyN∈Nsuch that|N|>2, anyθN∈QNand anyi∈N, one can verify thattip(θN)=-∑s∈Fi(σ(θN))θs=∑p∈Pi(σ(θN))tip(θi,θp)+∑s∈Fi(σ(θN))tip(θi,θs)=∑j∈N⧹{i}tip(θi,θj). Hence we obtain 2-subgroup additivity forφp.For the reward based pivotal ruleφrwithN={i,j}andi,j∈I, we gettir(θi,θj)=0ifσi(θi,θj)=1andtir(θi,θj)=θjifσi(θi,θj)=2. Therefore, for anyN∈Nsuch that|N|>2, anyθN∈QNand anyi∈N, one can verify thattir(θN)=∑p∈Pi(σ(θN))θp=∑p∈Pi(σ(θN))tir(θi,θp)+∑s∈Fi(σ(θN))tir(θi,θs)=∑j∈N⧹{i}tir(θi,θj). Hence we obtain 2-subgroup additivity forφr.Finally to prove 3-subgroup additivity ofφGwe have to prove that for anyN∈N,|N|>3, anyθN∈QN,and anyi∈N,tiG(θN)=(1/(|N|-2))∑{j,l}⊂N⧹{i}tiG(θi,θ{j,l}). Consider anyN∈N,|N|>3, anyθN∈QN, anyi∈Nand anyS={i,j,l}⊂N. Using the transfer (2.3) ofφGwe have(3.7)tiGθi,θ{j,l}=min{θj,θl}if{j,l}⊆Piσ(θN),-max{θj,θl}if{j,l}⊆Fiσ(θN),0otherwise.Consider anyp∈Piσ(θN)and all{j,l}⊆N⧹{i}such thatp∈{j,l}andtiGθi,θ{j,l}=θp. Given (3.7), this can happen for those{j,l}such thatp∈{j,l}and the other agentp′in{j,l}is a predecessor ofp, that isp′∈Ppσ(θN). The total number of cases such thattiGθi,θ{j,l}=θpis equal to|Ppσ(θN)|1=σp(θN)-1. Similarly, consider anys∈Fiσ(θN)and all{j,l}⊆N⧹{i}such thats∈{j,l}andtiθi,θ{j,l}=-θs. Given (3.7), this can happen for those{j,l}such thats∈{j,l}and the other agents′in{j,l}is a successor ofs, that iss′∈Fsσ(θN). The total number of cases for whichtiGθi,θ{j,l}=-θsis|Fsσ(θN)|1=|N|-σs(θN). Combining all these observations it follows that given anyθN∈QN, for eachi∈N,∑{j,l}⊂N⧹{i}tiGθi,θ{j,l}|N|-2=∑p∈Pi(σ(θN))σp(θN)-1|N|-2θp-∑s∈Fi(σ(θN))|N|-σs(θN)|N|-2θs=tiG(θN).Hence we obtain 3-subgroup additivity forφG. □In this section we characterize the four 2-subgroup additive rules by using axioms that are all weaker versions of strategyproofness.Definition 4.1A ruleφis strategyproof (SP) if for allN∈N, allθN,θN′∈QNwith the property that for allj∈N⧹{i},θj′=θj,all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),and all(σ′,t′)∈φ(θN′),ui(σi,ti;θi)⩾ui(σi′,ti′;θi).We introduce a weakening of strategyproofness by requiring that it is applied separately to agents with extreme costs. Strategyproofness for the highest cost agent requires that an increase in the highest waiting cost should not affect the utility of the agent with the highest cost. Strategyproofness for the lowest cost agent requires that a decrease in the lowest waiting cost should not affect his utility.Definition 4.2A ruleφis strategyproof for the highest cost agent (H-SP) if for allN∈N, allθN,θN′∈QN,all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),all(σ′,t′)∈φ(θN′),and alli∈N,ifσi=1,θi′>θi,and for allj≠i,θj′=θj,thenui(σi,ti;θi)=ui(σi′,ti′;θi).A ruleφis strategyproof for the lowest cost agent (L-SP) if for allN∈N, allθN,θN′∈QN,all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),all(σ′,t′)∈φ(θN′),and alli∈N,ifσi=|N|,θi′<θi,and for allj≠i,θj′=θj,thenui(σi,ti;θi)=ui(σi′,ti′;θi).The minimal and the maximal transfer rules correspond to the Shapley values of appropriately defined coalitional games and these two rules satisfy 2-subgroup additivity and are not strategyproof. However, it is interesting to note that the minimal transfer rule does not give an agent with the highest waiting cost an incentive to misrepresent his true waiting cost and the maximal transfer rule does not give an agent with the lowest waiting cost an incentive to misrepresent his true waiting cost.Next we ask whether it is possible to find rules that satisfy both 2-subgroup additivity along with strategyproofness or something stronger like weak group strategyproofness? If we are willing to sacrifice the requirement of budget balance the answer is yes. The pivotal ruleφpand the reward-based pivotal ruleφrare such examples. Moreover, these two rules can be characterized by replacing budget balance with exactly one of the two following axioms.Definition 4.4A ruleφsatisfies last agent zero transfer (LAZT) if for allN∈N, allθN∈QN,all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),ti=0forσi=|N|.A ruleφsatisfies first agent zero transfer (FAZT) if for allN∈N, allθN∈QN,all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),ti=0forσi=1.(S1) The minimal transfer ruleφMis the only rule satisfying EFF, BB, PI, 2-ETE, H-SP and 2-subgroup additivity.(S2) The maximal transfer ruleφCis the only rule satisfying EFF, BB, PI, 2-ETE, L-SP and 2-subgroup additivity.(S3) The pivotal ruleφpis the only rule satisfying EFF, LAZT, PI, 2-ETE, H-SP and 2-subgroup additivity.(S4) The reward based pivotal ruleφris the only rule satisfying EFF, FAZT, PI, 2-ETE, L-SP and 2-subgroup additivity.Proof of (S1): It is easy to see thatφMsatisfies EFF, BB, PI, 2-ETE, H-SP and 2-subgroup additivity. To prove the converse statement, letφbe a rule satisfying the six axioms. We begin with a 2-agent problem. To simplify the notation, we assume without loss of generality thatN={1,2}andθN∈QNbe such thatθ1⩾θ2.LetθN′≡(θ2,θ2)and(σ′,t′)∈φ(θN′)such thatσ1′=1andσ2′=2.By BB and 2-ETE,t1′=-(1/2)θ2andt2′=(1/2)θ2. Suppose that the waiting cost of the first agent increases, so that the resulting problem becomesθN. Let(σ,t)∈φ(θN)and for alli∈N,σi=i. By H-SP,t1=-(1/2)θ2,and by BB,t2=(1/2)θ2,which shows that on the class of 2-agent problems,φcoincides with the minimal transfer rule. By 2-subgroup additivity, it follows thatφ=φM.Proof of (S2): It is easy to see thatφCsatisfies EFF, BB, PI, 2-ETE, L-SP and 2-subgroup additivity. To prove the converse statement, letφbe a rule satisfying the six axioms. We take a 2-agent problem and assumeN={1,2}. LetθN∈QNbe such thatθ1⩾θ2. LetθN′≡(θ1,θ1)and(σ′,t′)∈φ(θN′)such thatσ1′=1andσ2′=2.By BB and 2-ETE,t1′=-(1/2)θ1andt2′=(1/2)θ1. Suppose that the waiting cost of the last agent decreases, so that the resulting problem becomesθN. Let(σ,t)∈φ(θN).By EFF, PI and 2-ETE, we may assume that for alli∈N,σi=i. By L-SP,t2=-(1/2)θ1,and by BB,t2=(1/2)θ1,which shows that on the class of 2-agent problems,φcoincides with the maximal transfer rule. By 2-subgroup additivity, it follows thatφ=φC.Proof of (S3): It is obvious thatφpsatisfies EFF, LAZT, PI, 2-ETE, H-SP and 2-subgroup additivity. To prove the converse statement, letφbe a rule satisfying the six axioms. We begin with a 2-agent problem. We assume without loss of generality thatN={1,2}andθN∈QNbe such thatθ1⩾θ2.LetθN′≡(θ2,θ2)and(σ′,t′)∈φ(θN′)such thatσ1′=1andσ2′=2.By LAZT and 2-ETE,t1′=-θ2andt2′=0. Suppose that the waiting cost of the first agent increases, so that the resulting problem becomesθN. Let(σ,t)∈φ(θN)and for alli∈N,σi=i. By H-SP,t1=-θ2and by LAZT,t2=0which shows that on the class of 2-agent problems,φcoincides with the pivotal rule. By 2-subgroup additivity, it follows thatφ=φp.Proof of (S4): It is easy to verify thatφrsatisfies EFF, FAZT, PI, 2-ETE, L-SP and 2-subgroup additivity. To prove the converse statement, letφbe a rule satisfying the six axioms. We take a 2-agent problem and, without loss of generality, assume thatN={1,2}. LetθN∈QNbe such thatθ1⩾θ2.LetθN′≡(θ2,θ2)and(σ′,t′)∈φ(θN′)such thatσ1′=1andσ2′=2.By FAZT and 2-ETE,t1′=0andt2′=θ1. Suppose that the waiting cost of the last agent decreases, so that the resulting problem becomesθN. Let(σ,t)∈φ(θN)and for alli∈N,σi=i. By L-SP,t2=θ1and by FAZT,t1=0which shows that on the class of 2-agent problems,φcoincides with the reward based pivotal rule. By 2-subgroup additivity, it follows thatφ=φr.□A rule satisfies egalitarian equivalence if there is a reference bundle such that each agent is indifferent between his allocation and the reference bundle.Definition 5.1A ruleφsatisfies egalitarian equivalence (EE) if for allN∈N, allθN∈QN,and all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),there exists a queue positionσ0(θN)and a transfert0(θN)such that for alli∈N,ui(σi,ti;θi)=ui(σ0(θN),t0(θN);θi).As shown in Chun, Mitra, and Mutuswami (2013), there is a restricted family of rules satisfying queue efficiency, egalitarian equivalence and strategyproofness. Moreover, none of these rules satisfy 2 or 3-subgroup additivity. For the characterization results of this section, we limit our requirement of egalitarian equivalence only to 2 person problems and obtain characterizations ofφM,φC,φpandφr.Definition 5.2A ruleφsatisfies 2-egalitarian equivalence (2-EE) if for allN∈Nwith|N|=2, allθN∈QN,and all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),there exists a queue positionσ0(θN)and a transfert0(θN)such that for alli∈N,ui(σi,ti;θi)=ui(σ0(θN),t0(θN);θi).For our next result we use two stronger versions of egalitarian equivalence where, in the first version, the queue position in the reference bundle is fixed for all two agent problems and, in the second version, the queue position in the reference bundle is fixed for all two agent problems and it is also required that there exists at least one profile for the 2-agent problem for which the reference transfer is non-zero.Definition 5.3A ruleφsatisfies 2-egalitarian equivalence with fixed queue position (2-EEf) if for allN∈Nwith|N|=2, there exists a queue positionσ0∈{1,2}and a transfert0(θN)for eachθN∈QN,such that for all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),and alli∈N,ui(σi,ti;θi)=ui(σ0,t0(θN);θi).A ruleφsatisfies 2-strong egalitarian equivalence with fixed queue position (2-SEEf) if it satisfies 2-EEf and if for eachN∈Nwith|N|=2, there exists a profileθN∈QNsuch thatt0(θN)≠0.(E1) A ruleφsatisfies EFF, BB, PI, 2-EEf and 2-subgroup additivity if and only ifφ∈{φM,φC}.(E2) A ruleφsatisfies EFF, LAZT, PI, 2-SEEf and 2-subgroup additivity if and only ifφ=φp.(E3) A ruleφsatisfies EFF, FAZT, PI, 2-SEEf and 2-subgroup additivity if and only ifφ=φr.Proof of (E1): Letφbe a rule satisfying EFF, BB, PI, 2-subgroup additivity and 2-EEf (and hence 2-ETE). Consider a two agent problem such thatN={1,2}andθN=(θ1,θ2)withθ1⩾θ2. By EFF, PI and 2-ETE, assume that(σ,t)∈φ(θN)is such thatσi=i. By BB and 2-EEf, we can have only the following possibilities.(a1)σ0(θN)=1,t0(θN)=-θ22<0andt=tM.(a2)σ0(θN)=2,t0(θN)=θ12>0andt=tC.Proof of (E2): Letφbe a rule satisfying EFF, LAZT, PI, 2-subgroup additivity and 2-SEEf (and hence 2-ETE). Consider a two agent problem such thatN={1,2}andθN=(θ1,θ2)withθ1⩾θ2. By EFF, PI and 2-ETE, assume that(σ,t)∈φ(θN)is such thatσi=i. By LAZT and 2-SEEf, we can have only the following possibilities.(p1)σ0(θN)=1,t0(θN)=-θ2<0,t1=-θ2andt2=0. Therefore,t=tp.(p2)σ0(θN)=2,t0(θN)=0,t1=-θ1andt2=0.Observe that (p2) fails to satisfy 2-SEEf sinceσ0(θN)=1irrespective of the profile and hencet0(θN)=0for all profiles. Hence we are left with (p1) which satisfies 2-SEEf. Therefore, if a ruleφsatisfies EFF, LAZT, PI and 2-SEEf, then it coincides with the pivotal rule for the two agent problem, and by 2-subgroup additivity we conclude thatφ=φp. The converse is obvious.Proof of (E3): Letφbe a rule satisfying EFF, FAZT, PI, 2-subgroup additivity and 2-SEEf (and hence 2-ETE). Consider a two agent problem such thatN={1,2}andθN=(θ1,θ2)withθ1⩾θ2. By EFF, PI and 2-ETE, assume that(σ,t)∈φ(θN)is such thatσi=i. By FAZT and 2-SEEf, we can have only the following possibilities.(r1)σ0(θN)=1,t0(θN)=0,t1=0andt2=θ2.(r2)σ0(θN)=2,t0(θN)=θ1>0,t1=0andt2=θ1. Therefore,t=tr.Of the five important rules only the symmetrically balanced VCG ruleφGfails to satisfy 2-subgroup additivity since it is defined for all problems with more than two agents. However, as shown in Proposition 3.5,φGis 3-subgroup additive. In this section we provide two characterization results ofφG. The first characterization imposes a strategic axiom and the second an equity axiom.Definition 6.1A ruleφis strategyproof for extreme cost agents (E-SP) if it is both H-SP and L-SP.Our second characterization of the symmetric balanced VCG rule uses the following axiom which requires that for each 3-agent problem, there is an agent indifferent to all three bundles. It is an equity requirement saying that the allocation should not favor one agent at the expense of another from the perspective of at least one agent.Definition 6.2A ruleφsatisfies 3-positional equivalence (or 3-PEq) if for allN∈Nwith|N|=3, allθN∈QN,and all(σ,t)∈φ(θN),there exists a queue positionσ0∈{1,2,3}such that for allj∈N,ui(σj,tj;θi)=ui(σi,ti;θi)whereσi=σ0.(V1) The symmetrically balanced VCG ruleφGis the only rule satisfying EFF, BB, PI, 3-ETE, E-SP and 3-subgroup additivity.(V2)The symmetrically balanced VCG ruleφGis the only rule satisfying EFF, BB, PI, 3-ETE, 3-PEq and 3-subgroup additivity.Proof of (V1): It is obvious thatφGsatisfies EFF, BB, PI, 3-ETE, E-SP and 3-subgroup additivity. To prove the converse statement, letφbe a rule satisfying the six axioms. We assume without loss generality thatN={1,2,3}and we takeθN∈QNsuch thatθ1⩾θ2⩾θ3. LetθN1≡(θ2,θ2,θ2)and(σ1,t1)∈φ(θN1)whereσi1=ifor alli∈N. By BB and 3-ETE,t1=(t11=-θ2,t21=0,t31=θ2).Suppose that the waiting cost of the first agent increases from what it was inθN1, so that the resulting problem becomesθN2≡(θ1,θ2,θ2)∈QN.Let(σ2,t2)∈φ(θN2). Using EFF, PI and 3-ETE, we assume that for alli∈N,σi2=i. By H-SP,t12=-θ2. By BB and 3-ETE,t22=0andt32=θ2implying thatt2=t1.Next suppose that the waiting cost of the last agent decreases from what it was inθN1so that the resulting problem becomesθN3=(θ2,θ2,θ3)∈QN.Let(σ3,t3)∈φ(θN3).By EFF, PI and 3-ETE we assume that for alli∈N,σi3=i. By L-SP,t33=θ2. By BB and 3-ETE,t13=-θ2andt23=0implying thatt3=t1.Now, consider the initial stateθN=(θ1,θ2,θ3)∈QNsuch thatθ1⩾θ2⩾θ3. Let(σ,t)∈φ(θN). By EFF, PI and 3-ETE, we assume that for alli∈N,σi=i. If we consider a move fromθN2toθN, by L-SP,t3=θ2. Alternatively,θNcan be obtained by increasing the waiting cost of the first agent fromθN3. By H-SP,t1=-θ2. Finally givent1=-θ2=-t3, by BB,t2=0. Altogether, we havet=(t1=-θ2=-max{θ2,θ3},t2=0,t3=θ2=min{θ1,θ2})=tG. We have shown that on the class of 3-agent problems,φcoincides with the symmetrically balanced VCG rule. By 3-subgroup additivity, we conclude thatφ=φG.Proof of (V2): It is obvious thatφGsatisfies EFF, BB, PI, 3-ETE, 3-PEq and 3-subgroup additivity. To prove the converse statement, letφa rule satisfying the six axioms. Therefore, given EFF, PI and 3-ETE, we assume without loss generality that forN≡{1,2,3},θN∈QN,θ1⩾θ2⩾θ3and(σ,t)∈φ(θN),σis such that for alli∈N,σi=i. By 3-PEq, one of the three agents should be chosen to satisfy the indifference requirements. Together with BB, we obtain the following three possibilities:(b1)(σ0=1,t2=0,t1=-t3=-θ1).(b2)(σ0=2,t2=0,t1=-t3=-θ2). (Therefore,t=tG.)(b3)(σ0=3,t2=0,t1=-t3=-θ3).ForN={1,2,3}, consider firstθN′∈QNis such thatθ1′>θ2′=θ3′≡x. Consider an allocation(σ,t)∈φ(θN′)such thatσi=ifor alli∈N. If we select the transfer from condition (b1), thenu2(σ2,t2;x)=-x<-2x+θ1′=-x+(θ1′-x)=u3(σ3,t3;x)and we have a violation of 3-ETE. Therefore, condition (b1) is ruled out. Similarly, forN={1,2,3}, consider anotherθN″∈QNis such thatθ1″=θ2″≡y>θ3″. Consider an allocation(σ,t)∈φ(θN″)withσi=ifor alli∈N. If we select the transfer from condition (b3), thenu2(σ2,t2;y)=-y<-θ3″=u1(σ1,t1;y)and we have a violation of 3-ETE. Therefore, (b3) is also ruled out. On the other hand, it is easy to check that (b2) is compatible with 3-ETE. Therefore, on the class of 3-agent problems, if a ruleφsatisfies EFF, BB, PI, 3-ETE and 3-PEq, thenφcoincides with the symmetrically balanced VCG rule. By 3-subgroup additivity, we conclude thatφ=φG.□Comparing the two characterizations ofφGin Theorem 6.3 it is obvious that given EFF, BB, PI, 3-ETE and 3-subgroup additivity, the extreme cost strategyproofness axiom (E-SP) and the 3-positional equivalence axiom (3-PEq) are substitutes. Also, it is easy to show that in our Theorem 5.5 (E1), we can impose 2-positional equivalence instead of 2-EEf.In this paper we have introduced subgroup additivity as the core axiom along with queue efficiency, equal treatment of equals and Pareto indifference to characterize five important rules from the queueing literature. These five rules were obtained and characterized in the queueing context from different normative and/or strategic considerations. This paper shows that these rules have a common type of subgroup additivity. Given subgroup additivity of these rules, the characterizations become simpler since what matters now is the set of axioms only on 2 agent or 3 agent problems. What our analysis shows is that in such a scenario strategic axioms (like weaker versions of strategyproofness) and equity axioms (like stronger versions of egalitarian equivalence) can act as substitutes. It must be noted that if we try to identify allocation rules that satisfy EFF, SP and EE, then we do get a non-empty class of allocation rules (see Theorem 3.2 in Chun et al. (2013)). However, none of the five important allocation rules characterized in this paper is included in this non-empty class of allocation rules satisfying EFF, SP and EE. Therefore, for substitutability between strategic and equity axioms, sub-group additivity at the two and three player level plays a significant role.
