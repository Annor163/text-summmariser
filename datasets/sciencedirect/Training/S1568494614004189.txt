In this paper, the author proposes some new ideas for the E-spread information systems for an epidemic E, and takes covering approximation spaces as mathematical models of E-spread information systems. By characterizations for connectivity of covering approximation spaces, the author solves the problem: How can one know that an epidemic E spreads easily or not easily in a E-spread information system? Furthermore, the author gives an example to demonstrate the usefulness, which gives a further application of rough set theory in medical sciences of the above result by logical methods and mathematical methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Would an epidemic spread easily in some crowd? It is an topic gained wide attention in epidemiological studies. Let E denote an epidemic and u, u′ be two persons in some crowd. By clinical medical researches and practices, it is possible that E would spread easily between the person u and the person u′ if both u and u′ have the same disease feature α. Further, it is not easy for a healthy person to be infected by the epidemic E. Based on the above, the following E-spread information system is introduced for our discussion.Definition 1.1Let E be an epidemic, U be a crowd, A be a set of some disease features and G be a information granule. A four-tuple (E, U, A, G) is called a E-spread information system if the following conditions are satisfied.(1)For each person u in the crowd U, there is a disease feature α∈A such that u have the disease feature α.For each disease feature α∈A, there is a person u in the crowd U such that u have the disease feature α.For each person u in the crowd U and each disease feature α in A, the information granule G shows that whether u has the disease feature α.For each pair u, u′ of persons in the crowd U, the epidemic E spreads easily between u and u′ if there is a disease feature α∈A such that both u and u′ have the disease feature α.Further, we define “spread easily” for an epidemic E in a E-spread information system.Definition 1.2Let (E, U, A, G) be a E-spread information system. We call that the epidemic E spreads easily in (E, U, A, G) if whenever two persons u, u′∈U, there are some persons u1, u2, ⋯, un∈U such that E spreads easily between the person uiand the person ui+1 for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1, where u1=u and un=u′.Thus, the previous question can be given again in the following form.Question 1.3How to judge if an epidemic E spreads easily in a E-spread information system (E, U, A, G)?In discussion of the above question, it is necessary to analyze data collected from (E, U, A, G). In order to extract useful information hidden in data, many methods in addition to classical logic and classical mathematics have been proposed. Rough-set theory, which was proposed by Pawlak in [27], plays an important role in applications of these methods. Their usefulness has been demonstrated by many successful applications in pattern recognition and artificial intelligence (see [2,4,14–17,19,21,25,28–30,32,37,38,40,44,45,49], for example). In particular, rough-set theory is also applied in medical science widely (see [18,26,39], for example). Naturally, it is a significative work to investigate Question 1.3 by using rough-set theory. In the past years, with development of information sciences and computer science, applications of rough-set theory have been extended from Pawlak approximation spaces to covering approximation spaces (see [1,9–11,20,33,36,46,50–56], for example).Recall that formal concept analysis is a kind of important mathematical tool for conceptual data analysis and knowledge processing [8,41]. In formal concept analysis, the data for analysis are described by formal context (U, A, R), which consists of universe U, attributes set A and relation R⊆U×A. Based on the formal context, formal concept analysis has been applied to information retrieval, database management systems, software engineering and other aspects [3,6,12,13,42]. In addition, in rough set theory, the data for analysis are described by information system (U, A, F), which corresponds to the formal context in formal concept analysis and consists of universe U, attributes set A and relation F between U and A. So formal concept analysis and rough set theory are two kinds of complementary mathematical tools for data analysis and data processing [47,48].In this paper, with the help of formal contexts, we establish some relations between E-spread information systems and covering approximation spaces. By these relations, we take covering approximation spaces as mathematical models of E-spread information systems, and convert investigations from the spread of the epidemic E in E-spread information systems to connectivity for covering approximation spaces. Moreover, we characterizes connectivity of covering approximation spaces by definable subsets of covering approximation spaces. Then, we can obtain the spread of the epidemic E in E-spread information systems by a simple algorithm, which answers Question 1.3 and gives a further application of rough set theory in medical sciences by logical methods and mathematical methods.Definition 2.1[[8]]Let U be a finite set of objects, A be a finite set of attributes, and R be a binary relation on U×A (i.e., R⊆U×A).(1)The triple (U, A, R) is called a formal context.The formal context (U, A, R) is called to be regular if for each u∈U and each α∈A, uR≠Ø and Rα≠Ø, where uR={β∈A:(u, β)∈R} andRα={v∈U:(v,α)∈R}.Remark 2.2Let (U, A, R) be a formal context, u∈U and α∈A.(1)(u, α)∈R means that the object u possesses the attribute α.It is clear that (u, α)∈R⇔α∈uR⇔u∈Rα.E-spread information systems can be denoted by formal contexts. In fact, for a E-spread information system, put the crowd and the set of all disease features in the E-spread information system are the set U of objects and the set A of attributes in a formal context respectively. In addition, for a person u and a disease feature α in the E-spread information system, it is the sufficient and necessary condition such that the person u has the disease feature alpha that (u, α) belongs to the binary relation R on U×A. Then (U, A, R) is a formal context.Definition 2.3Let (E, U, A, G) be a E-spread information system and let (U, A, R) be a formal context obtained by the above. Then the formal context (U, A, R) is called to be generated by (E, U, A, G).Lemma 2.4If (U, A, R) is a formal context generated by a E-spread information system (E, U, A, G). Then (U, A, R) is regular.ProofLet (U, A, R) be a formal context generated by a E-spread information system (E, U, A, G). We only need to proved that uR≠Ø and Rα≠Ø for each person u∈U and each disease feature α∈A.(1)Let a person u∈U. By Definition 1.1(1), there is a disease feature α∈A such that u have the disease feature α, i.e., (u, α)∈R. By Remark 2.2(2), α∈uR. It follows that uR≠Ø.Let a disease feature α∈A. By Definition 1.1(2), there is a person u∈U such that u have the disease feature α, i.e., (u, α)∈R. By Remark 2.2(2), u∈Rα. It follows that Rα≠Ø.Definition 2.5Let (U, A, R) be a formal context.(1)For x, y∈U, x is called to be closely related to y if there is α∈A such that (x, α)∈R and (y, α)∈R.For x, y∈U, x is called to be related to y if there are u1, u2, ⋯, un∈U such that uiis closely related to ui+1 for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1, where u1=x and un=y.(U, A, R) is called objects related if x is related to y for each pair x, y∈U.Covering approximation spaces is an important generalization of topological spaces, which has the broader applications than topological spaces. And, there are some close relations between covering approximation spaces and formal contexts.Definition 2.6[[1]]Let U, the universe of discourse, be a finite set, andKbe a family of non-empty subsets of U.(1)Kis called a covering of U if U is the union of elements ofK.The pair(U,K)is called a covering approximation space ifKis a covering of U.Proposition 2.7(1)Let (U, A, R) be a regular formal context. PutK={Rα:α∈A}. Then(U,K)is a covering approximation space.Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space, whereK={Kα:α∈A}. Give a binary relation R on U×A: (u, α)∈R if and only if u∈Kα. Then (U, A, R) is a regular formal context.Proof(1)Since the formal context (U, A, R) is regular, Rα≠Ø for each α∈A. On the other hand, for each u∈U, uR≠Ø, i.e., there is α∈A such that α∈uR, hence u∈Rα from Remark 2.2(2). SoKis a cover of U consisting of non-empty subsets of U. It follows that(U,K)is a covering approximation space.It is clear that (U, A, R) is a formal context. For each α∈A, Kα≠Ø, so there is u∈U such that u∈Kα, i.e., (u, α)∈R, hence u∈Rα≠Ø from Remark 2.2(2). On the other hand, for each u∈U, there is α∈A such that u∈KαsinceKis a cover of U, hence (u, α)∈R, and so α∈uR≠Ø from Remark 2.2(2). Consequently, (U, A, R) is regular. □Definition 2.8(1)Let (U, A, R) be a regular formal context and let(U,K)be a covering approximation space obtained by Proposition 2.7(1). Then(U,K)is called to be induced by (U, A, R).Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space and let (U, A, R) be a regular formal context obtained by Proposition 2.7(2). Then (U, A, R) is called to be induced by(U,K).Proposition 2.9Let (U, A, R) be a regular formal context and(U,K)be a covering approximation space.(1)If (U, A, R) is induced by(U,K), then(U,K)is induced by (U, A, R).If(U,K)is induced by (U, A, R), then (U, A, R) is induced by(U,K).Proof(1)Let (U, A, R) be induced by(U,K), whereK={Kα:α∈A}. Then, for each u∈U and each α∈A, u∈Kαif and only if (u, α)∈R. Let(U,K′)be a covering approximation space induced by (U, A, R). ThenK′={Rα:α∈A}. We only need to prove thatK=K′. In fact, for each α∈A, u∈Rα if and only if (u, α)∈R from Remark 2.2(2), hence u∈Kαif and only if u∈Rα. This proves that Rα=Kα. It follows thatK=K′.Let(U,K)be induced by (U, A, R). ThenK={Rα:α∈A}. Let (U, A, R′) be a formal context induced by(U,K). We only need to prove that R=R′. In fact, for each u∈U and each α∈A, (u, α)∈R if and only if u∈Rα from Remark 2.2(2), and (u, α)∈R′ if and only if u∈Rα. So (u, α)∈R if and only if (u, α)∈R′. This shows that R=R′. □Now we give connectivity in covering approximation spaces, idea of which comes from topology [5].Definition 2.10Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space.(1)Let x, y∈U. x is called to be connected to y if there are K1, K2, ⋯,Kn∈Ksuch that x∈K1, y∈Knand Ki⋂Ki+1≠Ø for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1.(U,K)is called connected if x is connected to y for each pair x, y∈U.Lemma 2.11Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space. Then the relation for “connected” is an equivalent relation, i.e., the following hold for all x, y, z∈U.(1)x is connected to x.x is connected to y⇒y is connected to x.x is connected to y and y is connected to z⇒x is connected to z.ProofObviously, (1) and (2) hold. Let x be connected to y, and y be connected to z. Since x is connected to y, there areK1,K2,⋯,Kn∈Ksuch that x∈K1, y∈Knand Ki⋂Ki+1≠Ø for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1. Similarly, there areKn+1,Kn+2,⋯,Kn+m∈Ksuch that y∈Kn+1, z∈Kn+mand Kn+i⋂Kn+i+1≠Ø for each i=1, 2, ⋯, m−1. Consequently, there areK1,K2,⋯,Kn,Kn+1,Kn+2,⋯,Kn+m∈Ksuch that x∈K1, z∈Kn+mand Ki⋂Ki+1≠Ø for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n+m−1. This proves that x is connected to z. So (3) holds. □In this section, all formal contexts are assumed to be regular. At first, we establish some relations among the spread of E-spread information systems, objects relativity of formal contexts and connectivity of covering approximation spaces.Proposition 3.1Let (E, U, A, G) be a E-spread information system and (U, A, R) be a formal context generated by (E, U, A, G). Then the following are equivalent.(1)The epidemic E spreads easily in (E, U, A, G).(U, A, R) is objects related.Proof(1) ⇒ (2): Suppose that the epidemic E spreads easily in (E, U, A, G). Let u, u′∈U. Then there are persons u1, u2, ⋯, un∈U such that u1=u and un=u′, and for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1, E spreads easily between the person uiand the person ui+1 i.e., there is a disease feature αi∈A such that both uiand ui+1 have the disease feature αi, hence (ui, αi)∈R and (ui+1, αi)∈R. It follows that uiis closely related to ui+1 for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1. Consequently, u is related to u′. This proves that (U, A, R) is objects related.(2) ⇒ (1): Suppose that (U, A, R) is objects related. Let two persons u, u′∈U, then u is related u′. That is, there are some persons u1, u2, ⋯, un∈U such that u1=u and un=u′, and for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1, uiis closely related to ui+1. This show that for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1, there is a disease feature αi∈A such that (ui, αi)∈R and (ui+1, αi)∈R, hence both uiand ui+1 have the disease feature αi, it follows that E spreads easily between the person uiand the person ui+1. This proves that the epidemic E spreads easily in (E, U, A, G). □Proposition 3.2Let (U, A, R) be a formal context, and(U,K)be a covering approximation space induced by (U, A, R). Then the following are equivalent.(1)(U, A, R) is objects related.(U,K)is connected.Proof(1) ⇒ (2): Suppose that (U, A, R) is objects related. Let x, y∈U, then x is related to y, i.e., there are u1, u2, ⋯, un∈U and α1, α2, ⋯, αn−1∈A such that (ui, αi)∈R and (ui+1, αi)∈R for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1, where u1=x and un=y. That is, there are u1, u2, ⋯, un∈U andRα1,Rα2,⋯,Rαn−1∈Ksuch that ui, ui+1∈Rαifor each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1, where u1=x and un=y. So there areRα1,Rα2,⋯,Rαn−1∈Ksuch that x=u1∈Rα1 and y=un∈Rαn−1, and ui+1∈Rαi∩Rαi+1≠Ø for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−2. So x is connected to y. This proves that(U,K)is connected.(2) ⇒ (1): Suppose that(U,K)is connected. Let x, y∈U, then x is connected to y, i.e., there areKα1,Kα2,⋯,Kαn∈Ksuch thatx∈Kα1,y∈Kαn, andKαi⋂Kαi+1≠Øfor each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1. Put u1=x and un+1=y. Chooseui+1∈Kαi⋂Kαi+1for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1. Then, for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1,ui,ui+1∈Kαi, hence (ui, αi)∈R and (ui+1, αi)∈R from Proposition 2.9, i.e., uiis closely related to ui+1. So x is related to y. This proves that (U, A, R) is objects related. □By Propositions 3.1 and 3.2, we obtain the following theorem immediately.Theorem 3.3Let (E, U, A, G) be a E-spread information system, (U, A, R) be a formal context generated by (E, U, A, G), and(U,K)be a covering approximation space induced by (U, A, R). Then the following are equivalent.(1)The epidemic E spreads easily in (E, U, A, G).(U, A, R) is objects related.(U,K)is connected.Theorem 3.3 shows that our discussions can be converted from the spread of E-spread information systems into connectivity of covering approximation spaces, which makes it possible to solve Question 1.3 by using covering approximation operators to characterize the connectivity of covering approximation spaces. It is known that there are many covering approximation operators on covering approximation spaces (see [34], for example). However, our discussion will be around the following covering upper approximation operator and covering lower approximation operator, which are important and effective in issue for covering approximation spaces and were used frequently in discussions for covering approximation spaces (see [10,32,50,53,56], for example).Definition 3.4Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space. For each X⊂U, PutC¯(X)=⋃{K:K∈KandK⋂X≠Ø};C_(X)=⋃{K:K∈KandK⊆X}.(1)C¯:2U⟶2Uis called a covering upper approximation operator.C_:2U⟶2Uis called a covering lower approximation operator.C¯(X)is called a covering upper approximation of X.C_(X)is called a covering lower approximation of X.Remark 3.5(1)C¯andC_were called the second covering upper approximation operation and the covering lower approximation operation respectively by Wang and Zhu in [56], which were first studied by Pomykala in [32].In this section, a covering approximation space(U,K)is always supposed to be endowed covering approximation operatorsC_andC¯.In Pawlak's models, approximation operators can generate three concepts for definable subset: definable subset, inner definable subset and outer definable subset (see [31], for example). We generalize these concepts from Pawlak's models to covering approximation spaces.Definition 3.6Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space and X⊆U.(1)X is called a definable subset of(U,K)ifC¯(X)=C_(X).X is called an outer definable subset of(U,K)ifC¯(X)=X.X is called an inner definable subset of(U,K)ifC_(X)=X.It is well known that a topological space(X,T)is connected if and only if(X,T)has no non-empty both open and closed proper subset. Note that definable subsets of covering approximation spaces are similar to both open and closed subsets of topological spaces. It is natural to raise the following conjecture.Conjecture 3.7Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space. Then the following are equivalent(1)(U,K)is connected.(U,K)has no non-empty definable proper subset.We will give an affirmative answer for Conjecture 3.7.Lemma 3.8[[56]]Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space and X⊆U. ThenC_(X)⊆X⊆C¯(X).By Lemma 3.8, the following lemma is obtained immediately.Lemma 3.9Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space and X⊆U. Then X is a definable subset of(U,K)if and only if X is a both inner definable and outer definable subset of(U,K).Lemma 3.10Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space and X⊆U. Consider the following conditions.(1)X is a definable subset of(U,K).X is an outer definable subset of(U,K).X is an inner definable subset of(U,K).Then (1) ⇔ (2) ⇒ (3) ≱ (2).Proof(1) ⇒ (2): Let X be a definable subset of(U,K). By Lemma 3.9, X is an outer definable subset of(U,K).(2) ⇒ (3): Let X be an outer definable subset of(U;K), thenC¯(X)=X. Let x∈X thenx∈C¯(X), i.e., there isK∈Ksuch that x∈K and K⋂X≠Ø, and henceK⊂C¯(X)=X. It follows thatx∈K⊂C_(X). This proves thatX⊂C_(X). SinceC_(X)⊂Xfrom Lemma 3.8,X=C_(X). So X is an inner definable subset of(U,K).(2) ⇒ (1): Let X be an outer definable subset of(U;K). By the above (2) ⇒ (3), X is an inner definable subset of(U,K). By Lemma 3.9, X is a definable subset of(U,K).(3) ≱ (2): Consider a covering approximation space(U;K)and X⊂U, where U={a, b, c},C={{a,b},{b,c}}, X={a, b}. It is not difficult to check thatC_(X)=XandC3¯(X)=U≠X. So X is an inner definable subset of(U;K)and is not an outer definable subset of(U;K). □Lemma 3.11Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space and x∈U. Put X={y∈U:x is connected to y}. Then(U,K)is connected if X=U.ProofSuppose that X=U. Wheneveru,v∈U, then u is connected to x and x is connected tov. By Lemma 2.11(3), u is connected tov. This proves that(U,K)is connected. □Theorem 3.12Let(U,K)be a covering approximation space. Then the following are equivalent.(1)(U,K)is connected.(U,K)has no non-empty definable proper subset.Proof(1) ⇒ (2). Suppose that(U,K)is connected. Let X be a non-empty definable subset of(U,K). It suffices to prove that X is not a proper subset of U. By Lemma 3.8,C¯(X)=C_(X)=X. Choose x∈X, then for each y∈U, x is connected to y since(U,K)is connected, i.e., there areK1,K2,⋯,Kn∈Ksuch that x∈K1, y∈Knand Ki⋂Ki+1≠Ø for each i=1, 2, ⋯, n−1. Since x∈K1⋂X≠Ø,K1⊆C¯(X)=X. Furthermore, K2⋂X⊃K2⋂K1≠Ø, soK2⊆C¯(X)=X. In the same way, we can obtain thatKn⊆C¯(X)=X. Thus, y∈Kn⊆X. This proves that U=X. So X is not a proper subset of U.(2) ⇒ (1). Suppose that(U,K)has no non-empty definable proper subset. Let x∈U. Put X={y∈U:xisconnected to y}. Then x∈X≠Ø from Lemma 2.11(1). Whenevery∈C¯(X), there isK∈Ksuch that K⋂X≠Ø and y∈K. Pick z∈K⋂X. Then x and z are connected, and z and y are connected. So x is connected to y, i.e., y∈X. This proves thatC¯(X)⊆X. On the other hand,X⊆C¯(X)from Lemma 3.8, i.e., X is an outer definable subset of(U,K). By from Lemma 3.7(2), X is a definable subset of(U,K). It following that X=U. Consequently,(U,K)is connected from Lemma 3.9. □Theorem 3.12 characterizes connectivity of covering approximation spaces by definable subsets, which has certified Conjecture 3.7. This shows that we can solve Question 1.3 by covering approximation operators on covering approximation spaces, which can be done by an algorithm. Further, the following corollary is obtained immediately.Corollary 3.13Let (E, U, A, G) be a E-spread information system, (U, A, R) be a formal context generated by (E, U, A, G), and(U,K)be a covering approximation space induced by (U, A, R). Then the following are equivalent.(1)The epidemic E spreads easily in (E, U, A, G).(U,K)has no non-empty definable proper subset.In this section, we demonstrate an application for connectivity of covering approximation spaces on the spread of E-spread information systems. At first, we give some steps to obtain this application.Step 4.1Let (E, U, A, G) be a E-spread information system.(1)By Definition, we convert the E-spread information system (E, U, A, G) to a regular formal context (U, A, R), where (U, A, R) is generated by (E, U, A, G).By Proposition 2.7, we convert the regular formal context (U, A, R) to a covering approximation space(U,K), where(U,K)is induced by (U, A, R).By Definition, we endow covering approximation operatorsC¯andC_on the covering approximation space(U,K).By Definition, we give all outer definable subsets of(U,K)by a simple algorithm.By the above (4), Lemma and Corollary, it is known that whether the epidemic E spreads easily in the E-spread information system (E, U, A, G).Now we gives an analog example to show that our approach does work. This work is to assess that whether a epidemic spreads easily in a crowd.Example 4.2In Soochow University Kindergarten, there are three grade: the Junior Grade, the Middle Grade and the Top Grade. Our investigation is around Class 1 of the Top Grade for the bird-influenza P in the winter of 2012, which is stated as follows.In the winter of 2012, Suzhou has detected some confirmed cases of the bird-influenza P in humans. Most of these patients have history of possible poultry exposure. However, some cases show that the bird-influenza P may spread among humans under certain conditions. Note that we aim usefulness of connectivity of covering approximation spaces. So our investigation is discussed under ideal state. Based on such consideration and combining some results of clinical medicine, we conjecture that the bird-influenza P spreads easily between the person x and the person y if and only if x and y have the same disease feature cold, or cough, or coryza, or chronic pharyngitis, or chronic tonsillitis, or chronic bronchitis. For example, assume that x catches cold. If x is infected with the bird-influenza P virus, then y is infected with the bird-influenza P virus easily when y catches cold; and it is not easy for y to be infected with the bird-influenza P virus easily when y does not catch cold.The Class 1 of the Top Grade in Soochow University Kindergarten consists of thirty children. By medical examinations for children in this class, there is no child to be infected with the bird-influenza P. However, there are nine children u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9 in this class to be not healthy and to have the following disease features.(1)u1 has disease features cold and cough;u2 has disease features chronic pharyngitis and chronic tonsillitis;u3 has disease features cold and coryza;u4 has disease features cough and coryza;u5 has disease features chronic pharyngitis, chronic tonsillitis and chronic bronchitis;u6 has disease features chronic pharyngitis and chronic bronchitis;u7 has disease features chronic pharyngitis, chronic tonsillitis and chronic bronchitis;u8 has disease features cold and coryza;u9 has disease features cold and cough.In addition, other 21 children in this class are healthy and have very strong antibodies hence they are very strong in immunity to the bird-influenza P, so the bird-influenza P is not easy to spread among these twenty-one children. Thus, our investigation is discussed only among nine children u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9.Does the bird-influenza P spread easily among nine children u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9?(1)The E-spread information system (E, U, A, G) established by the above Part 1.(1.1)Let E be the bird-influenza P.Let U={u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9}, which is the set of nine children.Let A={a, b, c, d, e, f}, where a, b, c, d, e, f denotes six disease features cold, cough, coryza, chronic pharyngitis, chronic tonsillitis or chronic bronchitis, respectively.Let G is the information granule described in the above Part 1.The regular formal context (U, A, R) generated by (E, U, A, G). By Definition, the E-spread information system (E, U, A, G) generates a regular formal context (U, A, R), which is described in Table 1. Here, U={u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9}, A={a, b, c, d, e, f}, and the number, which lies in the cross of the row labeled by x (x=u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9) and the column labeled by t (t=a, b, c, d, e, f), is 1 or 0 by (x, t)∈R or (x, t)∉R.The covering approximation space(U,K)induced by (U, A, R).By Proposition 2.7, we convert the regular formal context (U, A, R) to a covering approximation space(U,K)as follows, where(U,K)is induced by (U, A, R) from Definition 2.8.(3.1)U={u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9}.K={Kα:α∈A}, where A={a, b, c, d, e, f}, Ka={u1, u3, u8, u9}, Kb={u1, u4, u9}, Kc={u3, u4, u8}, Kd={u2, u6, u7}, Ke={u2, u5, u7}, Kf={u5, u6, u7}.Outer definable subsets of the covering approximation space(U,K).By Definition, we use a simple algorithm to obtain all outer definable subsets of(U,K). They are Ø, U, {1, 3, 4, 8, 9} and {2, 5, 6, 7}.The spread of the epidemic E in (E, U, A, G).By Part 3(4) and Lemma,(U,K)has a non-empty definable proper subset, and so the epidemic E is not easy to spread in (E, U, A, G) from Corollary.The bird-influenza P is not easy to spread among nine children u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9.Remark 4.3There are some very useful and effective research methods for problems-solving to our question. For example, Hybrid Rough Set Theory (HRST), RST combine with DEMATEL-based flow graph, formal concept analysis, etc ([7,22,35,43]), which are worthy of consideration in coming work.Remark 4.4This study proposes the E-spread system to define the epidemic spread process. The E-spread system is analyzed by the formal context through the concept of covering approximation relationship, which can be extended from the classical RSA (Rough Sets Approach) or DRSA (Dominance-Based Rough Sets Approach) (see [23,24]).Remark 4.5Example 4.2 is a further application of rough set theory in medical sciences, which makes it possible to research epidemiological studies by logical methods and mathematical methods.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we introduce the E-spread information systems for an epidemic E. With the help of formal contexts, we take the covering approximation spaces as mathematical models of the E-spread information systems, and prove that the epidemic E spreads easily in a E-spread information system if and only if the relevant covering approximation space is connected. Further, we investigate the covering approximation spaces with covering approximation operatorsC¯andC_, and characterize connectivity of covering approximation spaces by their definable subsets. Then, it is obtained that an epidemic E spreads easily in a E-spread information system if and only if the relevant covering approximation space has no non-empty definable proper subset. Also, we give an example to demonstrate the usefulness of connectivity of covering approximation spaces on the spread of E-spread information systems, which gives a further application of rough set theory in medical sciences by logical methods and mathematical methods.
