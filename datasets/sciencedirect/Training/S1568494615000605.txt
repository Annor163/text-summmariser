This article describes a multiobjective spatial fuzzy clustering algorithm for image segmentation. To obtain satisfactory segmentation performance for noisy images, the proposed method introduces the non-local spatial information derived from the image into fitness functions which respectively consider the global fuzzy compactness and fuzzy separation among the clusters. After producing the set of non-dominated solutions, the final clustering solution is chosen by a cluster validity index utilizing the non-local spatial information.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Image segmentation is one of the most difficult tasks and challenging problems in image analysis since the segmentation result plays an important role in further image processing [1]. It aims to divide an image into several non-overlapping meaningful regions with homogeneous characteristics [2]. In the past few decades, many researchers have proposed various segmentation algorithms, such as thresholding techniques [3,4], clustering algorithms [5–8], region-based approaches [9] and combination of some presented approaches [10,11]. Generally, image segmentation is basically clustering of the pixels in the image according to some criteria. Therefore, as the popular unsupervised pattern classification technique that can partition a set of objects into k groups, clustering algorithms are easily applied to image segmentation and have been proved its efficiency.The idea of data clustering is very close to the way of human thinking, which is the similar samples or pixels in the image are put into one group. One easiest method is utilizing the distance between the observed data to perform clustering. The distance between the data points in the same cluster should be shorter, and the distance between the data points in different clusters should be larger. According to this thought, one can design a clustering objective function and optimize it to achieve the final clustering result. In this kind of clustering algorithms, k-means (KM) and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm are the most popular algorithms and have been applied to various areas. In KM, the optimal partition is obtained by minimizing the total distance within the clusters and every data point either belongs to a certain cluster or not. Relying on the basic idea of KM, FCM also designs an objective function to perform a fuzzy partitioning such that the given data point can belong to several groups with the degree of belongingness. However, when KM and FCM applied to image segmentation, they are both sensitive to noise, outliers and other imaging artifacts due to not considering any spatial information in the image.In order to overcome the sensitivity of FCM to noise in the image, many researchers introduced the spatial information derived from the neighborhood of the pixel in the image (this kind of spatial information can be called local spatial information) into the objective function of FCM [7,12–15]. Ahmed et al. [12] modified the objective function of FCM by incorporating a spatial neighborhood term and proposed FCM algorithm with spatial information (FCM_S). Subsequently, Chen and Zhang [7] presented two variants of FCM_S (FCM_S1 and FCM_S2) to reduce the computational complexity of FCM_S. Furthermore, in Ref. [7], Chen and Zhang utilized a kernel-induced distance to replace the Euclidean distance and presented the kernel versions of FCM_S1 and FCM_S2 (KFCM_S1 and KFCM_S2). To speed up the image segmentation process of FCM with spatial information, Szilagyi et al. [13] generated a linearly-weighted sum image and proposed an enhanced fuzzy c-means (EnFCM) clustering algorithm. This algorithm is performed on the gray level histogram of the generated sum image instead of the pixels. Similar to EnFCM, Cai et al. [15] defined a non-linearly-weighted sum image and proposed a fast generalized fuzzy c-means (FGFCM) clustering algorithm. These two weighted sum image in EnFCM and FGFCM are both computed by using the neighborhood of the pixel. When the image is heavily contaminated by noise, the adjacent pixels of a pixel may also contain abnormal features and the above fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms with local spatial information cannot obtain satisfying segmentation performance. Instead of using the adjacent pixels of the pixel to generate the spatial constraint term, Zhao et al. [16] introduced a non-local spatial information derived from a large image domain of the pixel to construct the spatial constraint term and proposed a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm with non-local spatial information (FCM_NLS). The non-local spatial information of a pixel is obtained by utilizing the pixels with a similar configuration of the given pixel. FCM_NLS can achieve better segmentation results than the existing fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms with local spatial information.It is well known that the clustering performance relies on the objective function or cluster criteria. Both the traditional FCM and FCM algorithms with spatial information only consider the total distance within the clusters and utilize the single objective function for data clustering. These methods tend to be very effective for spherical or well-separated clusters, but they may fail to detect more complicated cluster structures. Moreover, these methods are quite sensitive to the initialization and may get into the local optimum. In order to solve these problems, many researchers attempted to optimize several cluster validity measures and proposed many multiobjective clustering approaches [17–23]. Among these approaches, a multiobjective evolutionary clustering proposed by Handl and Knowles [17] is an important work. In this method, the deviation and connectivity are used as two objective functions to be simultaneously optimized and the number of clusters can be automatically evolved. However, the chromosome length in this work is equal to the number of data points to be clustered. To reduce the search space, a special mutation operator which maintains a list of nearest neighbors for each data point is used in this method. It should be mentioned that this method is only suitable for crisp clustering. Some works of multiobjective fuzzy clustering can be found in Refs. [18–23]. In these methods, center based encoding technique is used and several cluster validity measures are utilized as the objective functions to be optimized. The method in Ref. [18] optimizes two cluster validity measures, Jm[24] and Xie–Beni (XB) index [25]. However, these two validity measures are not completely independent to each other, especially that these two validity measures are similar when the fuzzy exponent is 2. Therefore they may not obtain good Pareto-optimal solutions. In [21], Mukhopadhyay et al. utilized three cluster validity measure namely XB, Jm and PBM [26] as the objective functions and adopted clustering ensemble to obtain the optimal solution from the final non-dominated solution set. In [18–22], the number of clusters is priorly specified. In contrast, the method in [23] uses a variable string length coded strategy to encode cluster centers, by which the number of clusters can be automatically evolved. Moreover, this method utilizes the global fuzzy compactness and fuzzy separation as objective functions and adopts a validity index I[27] to obtain a single solution from the final non-dominated solution set. This method has been successfully applied to MR brain image segmentation.When the existing multiobjective fuzzy clustering algorithms applied to image segmentation, the used cluster validity measures do not consider the spatial information derived from the image. Therefore, when the image is heavily contaminated by noise, these methods may not obtain satisfactory segmentation performance. To overcome the sensitivity to image noise and obtain effective segmentation results, a multiobjective spatial fuzzy clustering algorithm (MSFCA) for image segmentation is proposed. In this method, the non-local spatial information derived from the image is introduced into the fitness functions which respectively consider the global fuzzy compactness and fuzzy separation among the clusters. MSFCA uses Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) [28] as the underlying optimization strategy. After obtaining the final non-dominated solution set, the best solution is selected according to a cluster validity index with the non-local spatial information in MSFCA. Moreover, MSFCA adopts the real-coded variable string length technique to encode the cluster centers in the chromosomes. So this method can automatically evolve the number of clusters. In the experiments, KM, FCM, FGFCM, FCM_NLS and the multiobjective variable string length genetic fuzzy clustering (MOVGA) method [23] are chosen as comparative methods. The experimental results on a synthetic image and some Berkeley segmentation images contaminated by noise show that MSFCA behaves well in evolving the number of clusters and obtaining satisfactory segmentation performance.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms. Then multiobjective spatial fuzzy clustering algorithm (MSFCA) is proposed in Section 3. In Section 4, MSFCA is verified by segmentation experiments on synthetic and real images. Finally, some concluding remarks and discussions are given in Section 5.Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is a method which allows a data point to belong to two or more clusters. Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} denote an image with n pixels, where xirepresents the gray value of the ith pixel. The objective function of standard FCM algorithm is(1)J=∑k=1K∑i=1nukim||xi−vk||2where vk(1≤k≤K) denotes the center of the kth cluster and uki(1≤k≤K, 1≤i≤n) represents the membership degree function value of the ith pixel belonging to the kth cluster. Moreover, ukineeds to satisfy the following constraints(2)∑k=1Kuki=1,uki∈[0,1],0≤∑i=1nuki≤nIn Eq. (1), || || denotes the Euclidean norm and the parameter m (m>1) is a weighting exponent that determines the amount of fuzziness of the resulting partition. Through minimizing Eq. (1), the update equations of the membership degree function ukiand the cluster center vkare(3)uki=1∑l=1K(||xi−vk||2/||xi−vl||2)1/(m−1)(4)vk=∑i=1nukimxi∑i=1nukimIn order to overcome FCM's sensitivity to noise and artifacts in the image, several modified FCM algorithms utilize the spatial information derived from the neighborhood window around each pixel [7,12–15]. This kind of spatial information is called local spatial information. Up to now, the local spatial information has had a lot of expression forms. Mean spatial information and median spatial information are two common kinds of local information. The mean spatial information of the ith pixel can be defined as(5)δi=1|Si|∑p∈Sixpwhere Siis the set of neighboring pixels in a window centered at the ith pixel and |Si| is its cardinality. Similarly, the median spatial information of the ith pixel is expressed as(6)ςi=median{xp},p∈SiMost of the FCM algorithms with spatial information introduce the above local spatial information into the objective function of FCM. Although FCM algorithms with local spatial information can obtain satisfying segmentation performance on an image with low noise level, the local spatial information obtained from the adjacent pixels of a pixel is not the most efficient when the image is heavily contaminated by noise. Actually, there are many pixels possessing a similar neighborhood configuration in an image [29]. Utilizing the pixels with a similar neighborhood configuration to the given pixel to obtain the spatial information is more reasonable than only using the adjacent pixels of the given pixel. We call this kind of spatial information as non-local spatial information.For the ith pixel, its non-local spatial informationx¯iis computed by(7)x¯i=∑j∈WirwijxjIn this equation,Wirdenotes a r×r search window centered at the ith pixel. The non-local spatial information of ith pixel is computed by utilizing the pixels in this window. wij(j∈Wir) is the weight between the ith and jth pixels, and satisfy 0≤wij≤1 and∑j∈Wirwij=1. The weight wijis defined by(8)wij=1Ziexp(−||x(Ni)−x(Nj)||2,σ2/h2)where h is the filtering degree parameter and controls the decay of the weight function wij, andZi=∑j∈Wirexp(−||x(Ni)−x(Nj)||2,σ2/h2)is the normalizing constant. Significantly, this weight wijrelies on the similarity between the ith and jth pixels. This similarity is computed by a Gaussian weighted Euclidean distance||x(Ni)−x(Nj)||2,σ2, where σ(σ>0) denotes the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel [29]. x(Ni) is the gray level vectors within a s×s square neighborhood Nicentered at the ith pixel. It can be seen from Eq. (8) that the pixels with a similar gray level neighborhood to the ith pixel own larger weights.Fuzzy clustering algorithms with spatial information first utilize the spatial information for each pixel to define a spatial constraint term and then introduce this spatial constraint term into the objective function of FCM. The modified objective function can be expressed as(9)J=∑k=1K∑i=1nukim||xi−vk||2+β∑k=1c∑i=1nukim||x¯i−vk||2=∑k=1K∑i=1nukim(||xi−vk||2+β||x¯i−vk||2)wherex¯ican be the local spatial information or the non-local spatial information of the ith pixel. The second term in Eq. (9) is the spatial constraint term and the parameter β controls the penalty effect of the spatial constraint term. The minimization of Eq. (9) using Lagrange multiplier method yields the following membership degree function and cluster center update equations:(10)uki=1∑l=1K((||xi−vk||2+β||x¯i−vk||2)/(||xi−vl||2+β||x¯i−vl||2))1/(m−1)(11)vk=∑i=1nukim(xi+βx¯i)(1+β)∑i=1nukimIn MSFCA, each chromosome is made up of real numbers which represent the coordinates of the centers of the partitions. If a chromosome i encodes the centers of K clusters in d dimensional space, then its length liis taken to be d×K. For example, a chromosome i encoding four cluster centers in three dimensional space is represented in Fig. 1. Each cluster center is considered to be indivisible.Each chromosome i in the population encodes the centers of a number Kiof clusters, such that(12)Ki=(rand(⋅)mod(Kmax−1))+2where rand(·) returns a random integer between 0 and infinity, and Kmax is a maximum upper bound of the number of clusters. Therefore, the number of clusters Kiwill range from 2 to Kmax. In MSFCA, the Kicenters encoded in a chromosome of the initial population are randomly selected distinct points from the gray feature set derived from the image.In MSFCA, two fitness functions Csand S are optimized simultaneously. Csis the global fuzzy compactness with spatial information, and S is the fuzzy separation. Csis computed as follows(13)Cs=∑k=1K∑i=1nukim(||xi−vk||+β||x¯i−vk||)∑i=1nukiwherex¯iis the non-local spatial information of the ith pixel and β is the spatial constrained parameter. The centers v1, v2, …, vKencoded in a given chromosome are first extracted and the membership degree values uki, k=1, 2, ..., K, i=1, 2, ..., n are computed using Eq. (10). As is known,∑i=1nukim||xi−vk||is the variation of the kth cluster, so∑i=1nukim(||xi−vk||+β||x¯i−vk||)can be considered as a kind of spatial weighted variation of the kth cluster and denoted as σsk.∑i=1nukiis the fuzzy cardinality of the kth cluster and denoted as nk. Therefore, Csis the global fuzzy compactness with spatial information and can be expressed asCs=∑k=1Kσsk/nk.If the cluster center vpis assumed to be the center of the fuzzy set{vq1≤q≤K,q≠p}, the membership degree of vqto vpis defined as follows:(14)μpq=1∑l=1,l≠qK((||vq−vp||2)/(||vq−vl||)2)1/(m−1),p≠qThen the fuzzy separation S is computed as(15)S=∑p=1K∑q=1,p≠qKμpqm||vq−vp||2In MSFCA, crowded binary tournament selection method [28] is adopted to generate the mating pool of chromosomes. In this selection method, once the chromosomes are ranked based on non-dominated sorting and assigned with crowding distance, the selection is performed using a crowded comparison-operator [28].The cluster centers are considered to be indivisible, so the crossover points can only lie in between two cluster centers. The crossover operation is performed stochastically with the crossover probability pcand must ensure that offspring chromosomes encode at least two cluster centers. For this purpose, the crossover operator in Ref. [30] is adopted in MSFCA. Suppose parent chromosomes P1 and P2 encode K1 and K2 cluster centers, respectively. Let η1 be the crossover point in P1 and can be generated as(16)η1=rand(⋅)modK1where rand(·) is function retuning a random integer between 0 and infinity. Let η2 be the crossover point in P2 and it may vary in [LB(η2), UB(η2)], where LB(η2) and UB(η2) are the lower and upper bounds of the range of η2, respectively. LB(η2) and UB(η2) are defined as(17)LB(η2)=min[2,max[0,2−(K1−η1)]](18)UB(η2)=[K2−max[0,(2−η1)]]If UB(η2)≥LB(η2), η2 is generated randomly as an integer between LB(η2) and UB(η2). Otherwise, η2=0. It can be easily verified that if crossover points η1 and η2 are chosen according to the above rules, then the number of clusters in each of the offsprings will not fall below 2.However, the above crossover operator has a limitation. The number of clusters in some of the offsprings may exceed Kmax, which is the maximum upper bound of the number of clusters. If the number of clusters in an offspring chromosome O is larger than Kmax, then the cluster centers in O are clustered via KM with the cluster number randomly generated from 2 to Kmax.After performing crossover operation, the mutation operation is applied to chromosomes. Each cluster center encoded in a chromosome is mutated with the mutation probability pm. If the kth cluster center vkneed to be mutated, the value of the pth dimension of vk, that is vkp, will becomevkp±10ξ, where ξ is a random number in the range [0,1] with uniform distribution. The ‘+’ or ‘−’ sign occurs with equal probability.MSFCA adopts NSGA-II as the underlying multiobjective framework to obtain the clustering solutions. As is known, the elitism operation is the most characteristic part in NSGA-II. Through elitism operation, the non-dominated solutions among the parent and child populations are propagated to the next generation. Therefore, the good solutions found so far are retained.In the final generation of MSFCA, a set of non-dominated solutions are obtained. From the algorithmic point of view, all the solutions in the final generation are equally important, but sometimes the user may want only a single solution. In [23], a cluster validity index I[27] is adopted to solve this problem. I is defined as(19)I(K)=1K×E1EK×DKLwhere K is the number of clusters. EKand DKare defined as follows(20)EK=∑k=1K∑i=1nuki||xi−vk||(21)DK=maxp,q=1K||vp−vq||The index I is a composition of three factors: 1/K, E1/EKand DK. EKmeasures the fuzzy compactness of the data set and decreases as K increases. It is obvious that E1 is constant for a given data set. DKmeasures the maximum separation between any two clusters among all clusters and is upper bounded by the maximum separation between any two points in the data set. As K is increased, 1/K is decreased, E1/EKis increased and DKis increased. Thus these three factors are found to compete with and balance each other critically. Larger value of the index I implies more compact and well-separated clusters and indicates better solution [20,23].In order to select a solution from the non-dominated solution set for noisy image segmentation problem, the spatial information derived from the image should be introduced into the cluster validity index I to improve its robustness to noise. Here, the non-local spatial information derived from the image is introduced into the index I and a novel cluster validity index with spatial information (IS) is proposed to select the optimal solution from the final non-dominated solution set. IS is defined as follows(22)IS(K)=1K×ES1ESK×DSKwhere the computation of DSKis the same to DK, and ESKis defined as(23)ESK=∑k=1K∑i=1nuki[||xi−vk||+β||x¯i−vk||]where the membership function ukiis calculated using Eq. (10),x¯iis the non-local spatial information of the ith pixel and β is the spatial constrained parameter.Fig. 2shows the detail steps of MSFCA in the form of a flowchart.To verify the effectiveness of MSFCA, some synthetic and real images are used in the experiment and KM, FCM, FGFCM [15], FCM_NLS [16] and MOVGA [23] are adopted as the comparative methods. In these methods, MSFCA and MOVGA can automatically evolve the number of clusters. The other algorithms are performed under different number of clusters ranging from 2 to Kmax and the solution with the highest value of index I (Eq. (19)) is considered along with the corresponding number of clusters. In this paper, Kmax is set to 10 for all the experiments. In addition, the clustering accuracy (CA) [31] and the adjusted rand index (ARI) [32] are adopted to evaluate the algorithm performance.For all the methods except KM, the fuzziness index m is set to 2. For KM, FCM, FGFCM and FCM_NLS, the maximal iteration num T and the stopping threshold ɛ are set to 300 and 10−5, respectively. For FGFCM, the parameters λsand λgare respectively set to 3 and 6 according to the results and analysis presented in [15]. Moreover, we select the result of FGFCM under 3×3 neighbor window as the optimal one to compare with other methods. The search window size r×r, the patch size s×s and the filtering degree parameter h for the non-local spatial information had been discussed in detail in [16]. According to the experimental analysis in [16], the parameters r, s and h are set to 21, 7 and 30 for FCM_NLS and MSFCA. The spatial constrained parameter β controls the penalty effect of the spatial constraint term in the objective function and it had been tested on a set ranging from 0 to 8 in [7,33]. Experiments in [33] show that the segmentation results under β=6 are satisfactory. Here, the parameter β in FCM_NLS and MSFCA is set to 6. The max number of generation G and the population size P are set to 100 and 50 in [18], and they are set to 20 and 20 in [23], and they are set to 40 and 20 in [22]. By comprehensively considering these relative references and algorithm complexity, the max number of generation G and the population size P in MSFCA and MOVGA are set to 50 and 20,respectively. In [22], the crossover probability pc and the mutation probability pm are set to 0.9 and 0.1,respectively. Thus, MSFCA and MOVGA adopt the same value setting of the parameters pc and pm.A synthetic test image is presented in Fig. 3(100×100 pixels) and it includes seven clusters with the corresponding gray values taken as 0, 36, 73, 109, 146, 182 and 219. In this section, we use this image and its noise corrupted images with different levels of Gaussian white noise to investigate the achieved number of clusters and segmentation performance of MSFCA and comparative algorithms. To generate these corrupted images, Gaussian white noise of mean 0 and normalized variance 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.012 and 0.016 is added to this synthetic image, respectively.Fig. 4a represents the obtained number of clusters of these six methods on images with different noise level, and Fig. 4b and c respectively show the corresponding CA and ARI curves of these six methods on these corrupted images. Fig. 4a shows that MSFCA can correctly evolve the number of clusters under all the noise levels except the last noise level. MOVGA can obtain the correct number of clusters under the first four noise levels. Similarly, under these four noise levels, the cluster number of KM, FCM, FGFCM and FCM_NLS corresponding to the highest value of index I are correct. However, under the other four noise levels, MOVGA, KM, FGFCM and FCM_NLS cannot obtain the correct number of clusters. For FCM, although its obtained number of clusters under the noise level of mean 0 and variance 0.008 is correct, the corresponding CA and ARI values are unsatisfactory, which are shown in Fig. 4b and c. It can be found from Fig. 4b and c that MSFCA obtains the highest CA and ARI values under all the noise levels except the last noise level. Therefore, under most noise levels, MSFCA behaves well in evolving the correct number of clusters and obtaining satisfactory CA and ARI values.Fig. 5a shows the corrupted synthetic image with Gaussian white noise of mean 0 and normalized variance 0.012. It can be found from Fig. 4a that only MSFCA among all the methods can detect the actual number of clusters on this noise corrupted image. Here, we adopt this corrupted image to compare the segmentation performance of all the methods under the actual number of clusters. The corresponding segmentation results of these methods are presented in Fig. 5b–g. These results reveal that MSFCA is the best among all the methods even if the real number of clusters is given for the other methods.In this section, we examine the performance of MSFCA and comparative methods on three real images which are chosen from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset [34]. These three images are shown in Figs. 6a, 7a and 8a, and their benchmark images obtained by manual are presented in Figs. 6b, 7b and 8b. Gaussian white noise with different noise levels are artificially added into these three Berkeley images. Table 1presents the obtained cluster number, CA and ARI values of all the methods on these noise corrupted images. In this table, C_num is the number of clusters in benchmark image and K denotes the cluster number obtained by the algorithms. In order to more obviously illustrate the visual segmentation performance, we select the Image 238011 with Gaussian noise (0, 0.01), the Image 15088 with Gaussian noise (0, 0.02) and the Image 28075 with Gaussian noise (0, 0.01) (these noisy images respectively shown in Figs. 6c, 7c and 8c) to present the corresponding segmentation results of all the methods. The results on the Image 238011 are shown in Fig. 6d–i, the results on the Image 15088 are presented in Fig. 7d–i, and the results on the Image 28075 are shown in Fig. 8d–i. For the Images 238011 and 15088, Table 1 reveals that MSFCA produces higher CA and ARI values than those produced by the other methods and the number of clusters obtained by MSFCA is the same as the cluster number of the benchmark image. For Image 28075, Table 1 shows that the ARI values of MSFCA are the highest among all the methods, although the CA values of MSFCA are not always the highest. Furthermore, the cluster number generated by MSFCA on Image 28075 is the nearest to the cluster number of the benchmark image. As shown in Figs. 6d–i and 8d–i, MSFCA obtains more effective segmented information than the other methods. Fig. 7d–i shows that MSFCA and FCM_NLS obtain almost the same segmentation results and behave much better than the other methods. It is evident that MSFCA outperforms all the comparative methods in quantitative and visual results.A multiobjective spatial fuzzy clustering algorithm (MSFCA) for image segmentation is proposed in this article. In order to improve the performance of traditional multiobjective fuzzy clustering technique on noisy image segmentation, MSFCA introduces the non-local spatial information derived from the image into the fitness functions to be optimized. Moreover, the non-local spatial information is also introduced into a cluster validity index by which the optimal solution is selected from the final non-dominated solution set. The fitness functions and cluster validity index with non-local spatial information can overcome the influence of image noise to the clustering performance. Moreover, in order to automatically evolve the number of clusters, a variable string length encoding technique is utilized. The experimental results on the synthetic and real images show that MSFCA outperforms KM, FCM, FGFCM, FCM_NLS and MOVGA.It is known that the fitness function is one of the most important aspects for multiobjective fuzzy clustering algorithm. To overcome the influence of higher level image noise to algorithm performance, our future work includes incorporating some more effective image spatial information into the fitness functions to be optimized. It is obvious that the spatial constrained parameter β controls the effect of the spatial constraint term in fitness function. In this paper, the parameter β is set manually. How to adaptively determine β deserves further research. In addition, our future research also include utilizing the edge and region information derived from the image to construct fitness functions or adopting other more effective fuzzy cluster validity indexes as fitness functions.
