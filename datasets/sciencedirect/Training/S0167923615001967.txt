@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The prevalence of social media has greatly catalyzed the dissemination and proliferation of online memes (e.g., ideas, topics, melodies, and tags). However, this information abundance is exceeding the capability of online users to consume it. Ranking memes based on their popularities could promote online advertisement and content distribution. Despite such importance, few existing work can solve this problem well. They are either daunted by unpractical assumptions or incapability of characterizing dynamic information. As such, in this paper, we elaborate a model-free scheme to rank online memes in the context of social media. This scheme is capable to characterize the nonlinear interactions of online users, which mark the process of meme diffusion. Empirical studies on two large-scale, real-world datasets (one in English and one in Chinese) demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme. In addition, due to its fine-grained modeling of user dynamics, this ranking scheme can also be utilized to explain meme popularity through the lens of social influence.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Meme (pronounced “meem”) was first coined by Richard Dawkin in analogy with gene in genetics four decades ago [1]. It is defined as “unit of conceptual replication” that identifies idea, topic or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. Like the natural selection of genes that confer ‘differential reproductivity’, memes also compete for our scarce individual and collective attention [2]. During this process, some of them quickly die out of popularity while others persist for a long period of time. In recent years, the advent of various social media platforms has lowered the cost of information generation, boosting the potential reach of each meme among online users. This information abundance is exceeding human capacity to consume it [3–5]. Therefore, an effective ranking scheme is imperative to focus human limited attention on the most important memes. Appropriate solutions for this issue would provide direct implications in refining online advertisement and content distribution. In online advertising, new revenue models could be developed to charge advertisers for the amount of attention that a meme will receive. In media outlets, ranking information can be used to highlight the most popular memes in realtime. These condensed results are especially beneficial in emergent situations where information fragments emerge at random moments, such as social events [6,7], public health [8,9], and political campaigns [10–12]. In light of such importance, meme ranking has attracted considerable research interests in various disciplines [2,13,14].However, to the best of our knowledge, few existing studies provide an adequate solution for meme ranking task. Traditional bottom-up approaches attempt to construct various diffusion models in analogy to behavior replication [15–18], epidemic contagion [14,19–24], or competitive gaming [25,26]. Although these models can help to track the diffusion process and measure its fact on online users, their computational complexities are often comparatively high, sometimes even NP-hard [27]. Furthermore, oversimplifications made in these models, such as user homogeneity [2,16], static network structure [19], and finite interaction patterns [28,29], can lead to unrealistic or even misleading conclusions. Recently, several top-down approaches have been developed to characterize meme dynamics, which is critical in accessing the evolution and mutation of online memes [4]. These studies mainly focus on quantifying the topological centrality [30,31], content similarity [32], or user behaviors [13] based on large-scale datasets. This line of research has provided significant insights in understanding the trend of the web. Yet, lacking fine-grained modeling of user interactions in meme diffusion, they still cannot characterize meme dynamics well.To solve the above challenges, in this paper, we elaborate a model-free ranking scheme that characterizes meme dynamics with few assumptions. Different from previous work, our ranking scheme is designed based on information theory and could capture complex meme dynamics without modeling its exact diffusion process. In addition, while most existing studies are concerned with aggregate measures for meme ranking, the scheme presented here allows more fine-grained characterization on information diffusion among online users. This key property enables us not only to rank meme at the macro level, but also to inquiry key factors determining meme popularity at the micro level. For evaluation, we have used two different genres of datasets: one from a Chinese microblogging system and the other one from an American political blog forum. Experimental results on these two datasets validate the efficiency and robustness of the scheme compared with several benchmark approaches. By examining two key factors pertaining to meme spreaders, we also uncover several principles governing meme popularity. These findings may provide both academic and industrial implications in understanding other new types of memes such as innovation [15], rumor [19], and viral marketing [14,28].The remaining parts of the paper are structured as follows. Section 2 reviews existing studies most relevant to our task. In Section 3, the technical details for the proposed meme ranking scheme are represented. Section 4 gives the empirical results of our proposed scheme in comparison with several existing approaches. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper with a summary and a discussion about future research directions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we proposed a novel model-free scheme for meme ranking. Empirical studies on two large-scale real world datasets validate its efficiency and robustness. This scheme can provide us significant insights into understanding the meme popularity due to its fine-grained modeling of user dynamics. By analyzing two key factors regarding the user influence, we uncover two significant findings: (1) the meme popularity is achieved by a wide scale of users on its diffusion trace, while just a small amount of high influential users is insufficient; (2) more popular memes are prone to contain less zero-influence users.In our future work, we intend to investigate whether other types of dynamic information also contribute to meme ranking task, such as user passivity and adoption rate. As only user behaviors are considered in quantifying user dynamics, we wonder whether the patterns of user behaviors bear some relationship with meme ranking results. Further, we will investigate whether involving contextual information and the behavioral and cognitive factors of online users would predict the meme popularity more accurately.
