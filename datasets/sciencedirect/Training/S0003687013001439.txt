@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study investigated whether rural workers who have higher workplace satisfaction are less likely to report quad bike loss of control events (LCEs). Two independent samples of farmers completed a survey regarding LCEs and workplace satisfaction. In the first sample (n = 130) analysis revealed no relationship (p = 0.74) between workplace satisfaction and LCEs but lower rates of LCEs were reported by employees (IRR 0.52, 95%CI 0.31–0.86) compared to self-employed participants. In the second sample (n = 112), workplace satisfaction was weakly related to LCEs (IRR 1.04, 95%CI 1.00, to 1.09) with participants who found their job more psychologically demanding more likely to have had an LCE (IRR 1.14, 95%CI 1.05–1.23). Exploring the role of psychological demands on safety behaviour with respect to quad bike use, may help to address this important safety issue.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Quad bikes are used extensively on New Zealand (NZ) farms for stock work, transport, and towing farm implements (Milosavljevic et al., 2010; Moore, 2007) with an estimated 70 000 to 80 000 in current operation (Carman et al., 2010; Moore, 2007). Use of these vehicles, however, carries some risk of injury. Among NZ rural workers, quad bike incidents cause more than 850 injuries per year and claim an average of five lives (Department-of-Labour, 2010). The cost to the individual, their family, society and the economy as a whole is considerable. In 2009 NZ's nationalised no fault accident insurance scheme, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), outlaid more than NZ$7 million on medical, rehabilitation and workers compensation claims related to quad bike incidents (ACC, 2009).Despite workplace educational interventions from national agencies (Farmsafe, ACC and Department of Labour) the number of reported quad bike injuries and fatalities on NZ farms has not reduced. Recent research identified a considerable number of farm quad bike incidents in NZ are unreported (Milosavljevic et al., 2011) and the true working lifetime prevalence ratesare in excess of 60% (Carman et al., 2010; Milosavljevic et al., 2010). Risk factors associated with quad bike fatality and injury in NZ include vehicle design (Milosavljevic et al., 2010; Moore, 2007), environmental conditions (Basham et al., 2006; Milosavljevic et al., 2010) and personal factors (Milosavljevic et al., 2011; Shulruf and Balemi, 2010). Risk factors fall into two categories; non-modifiable factors such as farm terrain, weather conditions, the rider's height and weight, and modifiable factors such as speed and route. Quad bikes are inherently unstable with a narrow wheel base and a high centre of gravity. There are on-going debates between farmers and manufacturers as to the ideal vehicle design with no progress to date. Safe use of quad bikes on farms, therefore, continues to rely to a large extent on rider behaviour. Neal and Griffin (2004) conceptualised workplace safety performance behaviours as being determined by safety knowledge and the motivation to adopt such behaviours, both of which were derived, in part, by an individual's attributes (attitude, personality etc). Farmer's workplace safety attitudes and behaviours are often posited as a cause of quad bike incidents (Basham et al., 2006; Cryer et al., 2009; Lovelock et al., 2008; Palmer et al., 2009) Organisations responsible for NZ farm health and safety have also hypothesised that personality and social traits in this population make it difficult to change safety behaviours (Lovelock et al., 2008; Research NZ, 2007). Research suggests workplace satisfaction can be an antecedent to safety motivation and knowledge (Probst and Brubaker, 2001). If satisfaction is high, workers are more motivated to comply with safety measures, lowering accident and injury outcomes (Probst and Brubaker, 2001).Workplace satisfaction is the “overall affective orientation on the part of individuals work roles which they are presently occupying” (Kalleberg, 1977 p. 126). It is a complex construct that appears to be the composite of psychosocial aspects, specific job characteristics and an individual's personal factors that form a general like or dislike of the job (Cranny et al., 1992; Kalleberg, 1977; Locke, 1969; Warr, 2007). Global job satisfaction is related to occupational accidents and injury (Dembe et al., 2004; Harkness et al., 2004; Krause et al., 1998; Zontek et al., 2009). More specifically, a negative mood, high perceived physical demand, high perceived psychological demand and low co-worker support are associated with occupational accidents (Day et al., 2009; De Jonge et al., 2000; Harkness et al., 2004; Holmberg et al., 2004; Kaplan et al., 2009; Kirkcaldy et al., 1997; Krause et al., 1998; Lovelock et al., 2008; Rodgers and Adler, 2001; Swaen et al., 2004; Trimpop et al., 2000). It is psychometrically optimal to assess workplace satisfaction using multi-item questionnaires, which can be treated as a single factor or broken down to measure specific components of the job such as perceived physical or psychological demand, decision latitude, social support and task variety. There is limited existing knowledge of the role of workplace satisfaction in quad bike LCEs and broad models of occupational safety require further testing.The primary aim of this study was to use existing data, from two independent samples, to explore the relationship between workplace satisfaction and prevalence of prior quad bike loss of control events (LCEs). It was predicted that farm workers with lower workplace satisfaction would report more LCEs than those with higher workplace satisfaction scores. The secondary aim was to determine the model of best fit, in each study population, to describe this relationship adjusting for confounding variables.
