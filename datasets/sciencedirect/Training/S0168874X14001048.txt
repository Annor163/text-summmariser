@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a newly developed wavelet spectral finite element (WFSE) model to analyze wave propagation in anisotropic composite laminate with a transverse surface crack penetrating part-through the thickness. The WSFE formulation of the composite laminate, which is based on the first-order shear deformation theory, produces accurate and computationally efficient results for high frequency wave motion. Transverse crack is modeled in wavenumber–frequency domain by introducing bending flexibility of the plate along crack edge. Results for tone burst and impulse excitations show excellent agreement with conventional finite element analysis in Abaqus®. Problems with multiple cracks are modeled by assembling a number of spectral elements with cracks in frequency-wavenumber domain. Results show partial reflection of the excited wave due to crack at time instances consistent with crack locations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Composite structures are increasingly used in aerospace, automotive, and many other industries due to several advantages over traditional metals such as superior specific strength and stiffness, lower weight, corrosion resistance, and improved fatigue life [1]. One of the main concerns that restrict wider usage of composites is the damage mechanisms which are not well understood. Most common damage types are delamination between plies, fiber–matrix debonding, fiber breakage, and matrix cracking resulting from fatigue, manufacturing defects, foreign object impact, etc. Currently available non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods such as ultrasonic, radiography, and eddy-current are time consuming, expensive, and may need structural disassembly for inspection. In addition, these techniques are not suitable for damage detection during operational conditions such as aircraft or space structures in service. Therefore, a structural health monitoring (SHM) system capable of performing diagnostics online and efficiently is urgently needed. In recent years, Lamb wave based SHM techniques have been widely investigated for damage detection in composite structures [2–10].SHM is essentially an inverse problem where the measured data are used to predict the condition of the structure. Therefore, to be able to differentiate between damage and structural features, prior information is required about the structure in its undamaged state. This is typically in the form of a baseline data obtained from the “healthy state” to use as reference for comparison with the test case. Alternatively, a mathematical model, such as a conventional finite element (FE) simulation, may be used to predict the structural response for comparison purposes. However, small damages such as transverse cracks (resulting from fiber breakage in composite structures) need high frequency Lamb waves for detection. Lowe et al. [11] observed a sinusoidal variation of the reflection coefficient with the ratio of notch width to A0 mode wavelength and determined that the reflection coefficient is maximized for small notch depths when the ratio stands at 0.5. In another observation, the reflection coefficient is maximized for the notch depth to A0 mode wavelength ratio of 0.3–0.4. These observations suggest that the diagnostic signal wavelength should be comparable to damage size for SHM. Therefore, high frequency excitation signals are generally used in SHM to identify minute damages present in structures. However, for high frequency excitation FE mesh size should be sufficiently refined (usually at least 20 nodes per wavelength) in order to reach acceptable solution accuracy which leads to large system size and computational cost. Thus FE simulation becomes prohibitive for SHM, especially onboard diagnostics with limited resources. The spectral finite element method (SFEM) yields models that are many orders smaller than FE, making it highly suitable for wave propagation based SHM. The transverse crack model developed here would be useful for understanding interactions between Lamb waves and cracks, optimizing excitation (interrogation) signal for damage detection, and inference of damage type (based on damage–wave interaction features).The SFEM is essentially a finite element method formulated in the frequency domain, which uses the exact solution to the wave equations as its interpolating function. The frequency domain formulation of SFEM enables direct relationship between output and input through the system transfer function (or, frequency response function). In SFEM, nodal displacements are related to nodal tractions through frequency-wave number dependent stiffness matrix and mass distribution is captured exactly to derive the accurate elemental dynamic stiffness matrix. Consequently, in the absence of any discontinuities, one element is sufficient to model a plate structure of any length. Fast Fourier transform based spectral finite element (FSFE) method was popularized by Doyle [12], who formulated FSFE models for isotropic 1-D and 2-D waveguides including elementary rod, Euler Bernoulli beam, and thin plates. Gopalakrishnan et al. [13] extensively investigated FSFE models for beams and plates-with anisotropic and inhomogeneous material properties. The FSFE method is very efficient for wave motion analysis and it is suitable for solving inverse problems. However, the required assumption of periodicity in time approximation results in “wraparound” problem for smaller time window, which totally distorts the response. In addition, for 2-D problems, FSFE are essentially semi-infinite, that is, they are bounded only in one direction [12]. Thus, the effect of lateral boundaries cannot be captured and this can again be attributed to the global basis functions of the Fourier series approximation of the spatial dimension. The 2-D wavelet transform based spectral finite element (WSFE) method presented by Mitra and Gopalakrishnan [14–16] overcomes the “wraparound” problem and can accurately model 2-D plate structures of finite dimensions.Considerable work has been done for FE modeling of damages in composite plates [17,18]; however, only a few researchers have approached the problem using the spectral finite element method. Palacz et al. [19] presented a spectral element to analyze transverse crack in isotropic rod. Gopalakrishnan and associates have formulated FSFE models for (open and non-propagating) transverse cracks and delaminations in composite beams and plates [20,21]. Levy and Rice [22] have shown that the slope discontinuity at both sides of a crack due to the bending moments is proportional to the bending compliance of the crack and nominal bending stress. Using the expressions given in [22], Khadem and Rezaee [23] obtained slope discontinuity at both sides of the hypothetical boundary along the crack in terms of the characteristics of the crack. Krawczuk et al. [9] used these expressions to model a transverse crack using Fourier based spectral element for isotropic plates. In a similar approach, Chakraborty et al. [24] modeled wave propagation in a shear deformable composite laminate with transverse crack using Fourier based spectral finite element method. However, FSFE technique suffer from the ‘wraparound’ problem and cannot model finite structures, as noted earlier.This study develops WSFE model for a non-propagating and open transverse crack in shear deformable laminated composite plates. The developed model has the ability to simulate wave propagation in 2D finite structures with transverse cracks, without the ‘wraparound’ problem of the FSFE method. In this procedure, the plate with one crack is divided into two sub-elements, one on either side of the crack. The placement of crack is parallel to one of the major axes (X or Y). Following the concept of crack flexibility [22,23], a discontinuity is introduced at the crack interface on the angular displacements about the axis parallel to the crack. The crack flexibility depends on crack parameters: length, depth at the center, and shape of the crack. A continuity condition is imposed at crack interface for all other angular and linear displacements, as followed by other researchers [9,24]. Composite laminates with multiple cracks are modeled similarly and the WSFE results are validated with conventional FE analysis using Abaqus®.The rest of paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the WSFE modeling of shear deformable composite laminates is introduced briefly. Next, the transverse crack formulation using WSFE is presented. The accuracy and efficiency of the WSFE modeling of crack is demonstrated by comparisons with FSFE and FE simulations. Efficient simulation of multiple cracks using WSFE is discussed. Concluding remarks are given in Section 5.The 2-D WSFE presented by Gopalakrishnan and Mitra [16] overcomes the “wraparound” problem present in FSFE and can accurately model plate structures of finite dimensions. This is due to the use of compactly supported Daubechies scaling functions [25] as basis for approximation of the time and spatial dimensions. However, the WSFE plate formulation in [16] is based on the classical laminated plate theory (CLPT) [26]. The CLPT based formulations exclude transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia resulting in significant errors for wave motion analysis at high frequencies, especially for composite laminates which have relatively low transverse shear modulus [27,28]. Wave propagation in composite laminates based on the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) [26], which accounts for transverse shear and rotary inertia, yields accurate results comparable with 3-D elasticity solutions and experiments even at high frequencies [27,28]. For isotropic materials FSDT is known to be exceptionally accurate down to wavelengths comparable with the plate thickness h, whereas CLPT is of acceptable accuracy only for wavelengths greater than, say, 20h [29]. FSDT based 2-D WSFE model for pristine composite laminates developed by the present authors is reported in [30,31]. Here, extensive time and frequency domain results are presented to show the significance of FSDT based spectral element formulation. The key steps in 2D WSFE element formulation for shear deformable composite laminates are presented below and the reader is referred to [30] for further details.Consider a laminated composite plate of thickness h with the origin of the global coordinate system at the mid-plane of the plate and Z axis being normal to the mid-plane as shown inFig. 1(a). Fig. 1(b) shows the corresponding nodal representation with degrees of freedom (DOFs). Using FSDT, the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for wave propagation have five degrees of freedom:u,v,w,ϕ,and,ψ. The terms u(x, y, t) and v(x, y, t) are mid-plane (z=0) displacements along X and Y axes; w(x, y, t) is transverse displacement in Z direction, andψ(x,y,t)andϕ(x,y,t)are the rotational displacements about Y and X axes, respectively. The displacements w,ϕand ψ do not change along the thickness (Z direction). The quantities (Nxx, Nxy, Nyy) are in-plane force resultants, (Mxx, Mxy, Myy) are moment resultants, and (Qx, Qy) denote the transverse force resultants.There are five governing equations of motion for wave propagation as reported in the authors׳ previous work [30], but only one EOM is presented here for conciseness. The first EOM based on the FSDT displacement field is given by [26],(1)A11∂2u∂x2+2A16∂2u∂x∂y+A66∂2u∂y2+A16∂2v∂x2+(A12+A66)∂2v∂y∂x+A26∂2v∂y2+B11∂2ϕ∂x2+2B16∂2ϕ∂x∂y+B66∂2ϕ∂y2+B16∂2ψ∂x2+(B12+B66)∂2ψ∂y∂x+B26∂2ψ∂y2=I0∂2u∂t2+I1∂2ϕ∂t2where the stiffness constants Aij, Bij, Dijand the inertial coefficients I0, I1 and I2 are defined as(2)[Aij,Bij,Dij]=∑q=1Np∫zqzq+1Q¯ij[1,z,z2]dz,{I0,I1,I2}=∫−h/2h/2{1,z,z2}ρdzThe termQ¯ijis the stiffness of the qth lamina in laminate coordinate system, Npis the total number of laminae (plies), ρ is the mass density, and K is the shear correction factor. The associated natural boundary conditions are,(3)Nnn=nx2Nxx+ny2Nyy+2nxnyNxy,Nns=−nxnyNxx+nxnyNyy+(nx2−ny2)NxyQn=Qxnx+QynyMnn=nx2Mxx+ny2Myy+2nxnyMxy,Mns=−nxnyMxx+nxnyMyy+(nx2−ny2)Mxywhere n and s denote coordinates normal and tangential to the plate edge, respectively; and nxand nyare unit normal intoXandYdirections, respectively. The boundary conditions at edges parallel to Y axis can be derived by setting nxto 1 and nyto zero. ThenNnnandNnsbecome the specified normal and shear forces intoXandYdirections,MnnandMnsare the specified moments aboutYandXaxes, andQnis the applied shear force inZdirection. Force and moment resultants are expressed in terms of the stiffness constants Aij, Bij, Dijand displacements [26]. Without loss of generality in all essential aspects of the problem, a laminate composed of an arbitrary number of orthotropic layers such that the axes of material symmetry are parallel to the X–Y axes of the plate (hence A16=A26=A45=B16=B26=D16=D26=0) is considered for further analysis.The governing PDEs (Eq. (1)) and boundary conditions (Eq. (3)) have three variables (x, y, and t), and derivatives with respect to them, making it very complex to solve. Therefore, Daubechies compactly supported scaling functions [25] are used to approximate the time variable which reduces the set of equations to PDEs in x and y only. Compactly supported scaling functions have only a finite number of filter coefficients with non-zero values, which enables easy handling of finite geometries and imposition of boundary conditions. The use of Daubechies compactly supported wavelets to solve partial differential wave equations is explained in detail in [14].Let the time-space variable u(x, y, t) be discretized at n points in the time window (0, tf) andτ=0, 1, …, n−1 be the sampling points, thent=ΔtτwhereΔtis the time interval between two sampling points. The function u(x, y, t) can be approximated at an arbitrary scale as(4)u(x,y,t)=u(x,y,τ)=∑kuk(x,y)φ(τ−k),k∈Zwhereuk(x,y)are the approximation coefficients at a certain spatial dimension (x and y) andφ(τ)are scaling functions associated with Daubechies wavelets. The other translational and rotational displacements v(x, y, t), w(x, y, t),ϕ(x,y,t)and ψ(x, y, t) are transformed similarly. The next step is to substitute these approximations into Eq. (1). The approximated equation is then multiplied with translations of the scaling function (φ(τ−j),forj=0,1,…,n−1) and inner product is taken on both sides of the equation. The orthogonal property of Daubechies scaling function results in the cancelation of all the terms except when j=k and yields n simultaneous equations.(5)A11{∂2uj∂x2}+(A66+A12){∂2vj∂y∂x}+B11{∂2ϕj∂x2}+(B12+B66){∂2ψj∂y∂x}+A66{∂2uj∂y2}+B66{∂2ϕj∂y2}=I0[Γ1]2uj+I1[Γ1]2ϕjwhereΓ1is the first-order connection coefficient matrix obtained after using the wavelet extrapolation technique for non-periodic extension. Connection coefficients are the inner product between the scaling functions and its derivatives [32]. The wavelet extrapolation approach of Williams and Amaratunga [33] is used for the treatment of finite length data before computing the connection coefficients. This method uses polynomials to extrapolate the coefficients lying outside the finite domain and it is particularly suitable for approximation in time and the ease to impose initial values. This extrapolation technique addresses one of the serious problems with Fourier based SFE method, namely, the ‘wraparound’ problem caused by treating the boundaries as periodic extensions. By solving the ‘wraparound’ problem, WSFE method is able to handle short waveguides and smaller time windows efficiently. Next, the coupled PDEs are decoupled using eigenvalue analysis ofΓ1following the procedure in [14]. The final decoupled form of the reduced PDEs given in Eq. (5) can be written as(6)A11∂2u^j∂x2+(A66+A12)∂2v^j∂y∂x+B11∂2ϕ^j∂x2+(B12+B66)∂2ψ^j∂y∂x+A66∂2u^j∂y2+B66∂2ϕ^j∂y2=−I0γj2u^j−I1γj2ϕ^j,j=0,1,…,n−1whereu^jis given byu^j=Φ−1uj,Φis the eigenvector matrix ofΓ1andiγj(i=−1)are the corresponding eigenvalues. Following exactly similar steps, the other governing PDEs and the natural boundary conditions are transformed to PDEs in spatial dimensions (x and y) only. It should be mentioned here that the sampling rateΔtshould be less than a certain value to avoid spurious dispersion in the simulation using WSFE. In Mitra and Gopalakrishnan [15], a numerical study has been conducted from which the requiredΔtcan be determined depending on the order N of the Daubechies scaling function and frequency content of the load.The next step is to further reduce each of the transformed and decoupled PDEs given by Eq. (6) (and similarly for the other transformed governing equations and boundary conditions) to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using Daubechies scaling function approximation in one of the spatial (Y) dimension. Similar to time approximation, the time transformed variableu^jis discretized at m points in the spatial window (0, LY), where LYis the length in Y direction. Letζ=0, 1, …, m−1 be the sampling points, theny=ΔYζwhereΔYis the spatial interval between two sampling points.The functionu^jcan be approximated by scaling functionφ(ζ)at an arbitrary scale as(7)u^j(x,y)=u^j(x,ζ)=∑lu^lj(x)φ(ζ−l),l∈Zwhereu^ljare the approximation coefficients at a certain spatial dimension x. The other four displacementsv^j(x,y),w^j(x,y),ϕ^j(x,y),andψ^j(x,y)are similarly transformed. Following similar steps as the time approximation, substituting the above approximations in Eq. (6) and taking inner product on both sides with the translates of scaling functionsφ(ζ−i), where i=0, 1, …, m−1 and using their orthogonality property (which results in the cancelation of all the terms except when i=l), we get m simultaneous ODEs. Eq. (1), which is temporally reduced in Eq. (6), can be spatially reduced as(8)A11d2u^ijdx2+(A66+A12)1ΔY∑l=i−N+2l=i+N−2dv^ljdxΩi−l1+(B12+B66)1ΔY∑l=i−N+2l=i+N−2dψ^ljdxΩi−l1+B11d2ϕ^ijdx2+A661ΔY2∑l=i−N+2l=i+N−2u^ljΩi−l2+B661ΔY2∑l=i−N+2l=i+N−2ϕ^ljΩi−l2=−I0γj2u^ij−I1γj2ϕ^ijwhere N is the order of Daubechies wavelet andΩi−l1andΩi−l2are the connection coefficients for first- and second-order derivatives [32].It can be seen from the ODE given by Eq. (8) that similar to time approximation, even here certain coefficientsu^ijnear the vicinity of the boundaries (i=0 and i=m−1) lie outside the spatial window (0, LY) defined by i=0, 1,…, m−1. Here, after expressing the unknown coefficients lying outside the finite domain in terms of the inner coefficients considering periodic extension, the ODEs given by Eq. (8) can be written as a matrix equation:(9)A11{d2u^ijdx2}+(A66+A12)[Λ1]{dv^ijdx}+B11d2ϕ^ijdx2+(B12+B66)[Λ1]{dψ^ijdx}+A66[Λ1]2{u^ij}+B66[Λ1]2{ϕ^ij}=−I0γj2{u^ij}−I1γj2{ϕ^ij}whereΛ1is the first-order connection coefficient matrix obtained after periodic extension.The coupled ODEs given by Eq. (9) are decoupled using eigenvalue analysis similar to that done in temporal approximation. Let the eigenvalues beiβi(i=−1), then the decoupled ODEs corresponding to Eq. (9) are given by(10)A11d2u˜ijdx2−iβi(A66+A12)dv˜ijdx+B11d2ϕ˜ijdx2−iβi(B12+B66)dψ˜ijdx−βi2A66u˜ij−βi2B66ϕ˜ij=−I0γj2u˜ij−I1γj2ϕ˜ijwhereu˜ij(and similarly other transformed displacements) are given byu˜ij=Ψ−1u^ij;Ψis the eigenvector andiβiare the eigenvalues of connection coefficient matrixΛ1. Exactly the same procedure is followed to obtain decoupled form for the other EOMs as presented in [30]. The natural boundary conditions (Eq. (3)) are also transformed (temporal and spatial approximations) similarly. The final decoupled ODEs are used for 2D WSFE formulation.The 2D WSFE has five degrees of freedom per node,u^ij,v˜ij,w˜ij,ϕ˜ij,andψ˜ij, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The decoupled ODEs presented above are solved foru^ij,v˜ij,w˜ij,ϕ˜ij,ψ˜ijand the final displacements u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t), w(x, y, t),ϕ(x,y,t)andψ(x,y,t)are obtained using inverse wavelet transform twice for spatial Y dimension and time. For further steps, the subscripts j and i are dropped for simplified notations and all of the following equations are valid for j=0, 1,…, n−1 and i=0, 1,…, m−1 for each j. Let us consider the displacement vectord˜as follows,(11)d˜={u˜(x)v˜(x)w˜(x)ϕ˜(x)ψ˜(x)}Since the final set of equations (that is, Eq. (10) and the decoupled form of other EOMs) is ordinary equations with constant coefficients, we assume a solution ofd˜as(12)d˜=d˜0e−iκx,d˜0={u˜0(x)v˜0(x)w˜0(x)ϕ˜0(x)ψ˜0(x)}whereκstands for the wavenumber. Substituting Eq. (12) into the Eq. (10), the set of equations can be posed in Polynomial Eigenvalue Problem (PEP) form [13]. PEP uses the concept of the latent roots and right latent eigenvector of the system matrix (also called the wave matrix) for computing the wavenumber and the amplitude ratio matrix. The PEP of above Eq. (10) and other EOMs can be expressed as,(13){A2κ2+A1κ+A0}{d˜0}=0The matricesA2,A1,A0are given in the Appendix.The wavenumbersκare obtained as eigenvalues of the PEP given by Eq. (13). Similarly, the vectord˜0is the eigenvector (representing wave amplitudes) corresponding to each of the wavenumbers. The solution of Eq. (13) gives a 5×10 eigenvector matrix of the form(14)[R]=[{d0}1,{d0}2,…,{d0}10]and the solution,d˜can be written as(15){d˜}=[R][Θ]{a}where[Θ]is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal termsdiag[Θ]={e−k1x,e−k1(LX−x),e−k2x,e−k2(LX−x),e−k3x,e−k3(LX−x),e−k4x,e−k4(LX−x),e−k5x,e−k5(LX−x)}Here,{a}T={C1,C2,⋯,C10}are the unknown coefficients which can be determined as described in [30]. Finally, the transformed nodal forces{F˜e}and transformed nodal displacements{u˜e}are related by(16){F˜e}=[K˜e]{u˜e}where[K˜e]is the exact elemental dynamic stiffness matrix. The solution of Eq. (16) and the assembly of the elemental stiffness matrices to obtain the global stiffness matrix are similar to the FE method. One major difference is that the time integration in FE uses a suitable finite difference scheme; however, the SFEM performs dynamic stiffness generation, assembly, and solution through a double do-loop over frequency and horizontal wavenumber. Although this procedure is computationally expensive, the problem size in SFEM is very small which keeps overall low computational cost. Another major difference is that unlike FE method, SFEM deals with only one dynamic stiffness matrix and hence matrix operation and storage require minimum computations.Although the WSFE method is applicable to general laminates, this study considers symmetric laminates wherein bending-extension coupling does not exist. For symmetric laminates, the equations of motion decouple into two sets of equations governing in-plane and transverse motions. The present model considers transverse motion of such laminates. A schematic diagram of the plate element with a crack (penetrating part-through the thickness and non-propagating) is shown inFig. 2. The length of the element in theXdirection isLxand the plate has finite dimension ofLyin theYdirection. The crack is located at a distance ofL1from the left edge of the plate (origin of the coordinate system) and has a length of 2c in theYdirection.Two sets of nodal displacements{w1,ϕ1,φ1}and{w2,ϕ2,φ2}are assumed on the left and right hand side of a hypothetical boundary along the crack. In the wavenumber–frequency domain, these displacements are represented as{w˜1,ϕ˜1,φ˜1}and{w˜2,ϕ˜2,φ˜2}and expressed by(17){w˜1ϕ˜1ψ˜1}=[R]3X6[Θ1]6X6{C1}6X1,{w˜2ϕ˜2ψ˜2}=[R]3X6[Θ2]6X6{C2}6X1where[R]3×6is the amplitude ratio matrix, and(18)[Θ1]6×6=diag[e−ik1x,e−ik2x,e−ik3x,e−ik1(L1−x),e−ik2(L1−x),e−ik3(L1−x)][Θ2]6×6=diag[e−ik1(L1+x),e−ik2(L1+x),e−ik3(L1+x),e−ik1(L−(L1+x)),e−ik2(L−(L1+x)),e−ik3(L−(L1+x))]are square matrices containing exponential terms. A total of 12 unknown constants of{C1}and{C2}are to be determined using the boundary conditions. These constants can be expressed as a function of the nodal spectral displacements using the boundary conditions as follows,1.At the left edge of the element(x=0)(19)w˜1=q˜1,ϕ˜1=q˜2,ψ˜1=q˜3At the crack interface (x=L1for{w˜1,ϕ˜1,ψ˜1}andx=0for{w˜2,ϕ˜2,ψ˜2})w˜1=w˜2,ψ˜1=ψ˜2(Continuity of transverse displacement and slope about X-axis across the crack).ϕ˜1−ϕ˜2=θMxx(Discontinuity of slope about Y-axis across the crack).Mxx1=Mxx2,Mxy1=Mxy2(Continuity of bending moments).(20)Qx1=Qx2(Continuityofshearforce).At the right edge of the element (x=L−L1forw˜2).(21)w˜2=q˜4,ϕ˜2=q˜5,ψ˜2=q˜6The termsq˜1,...,q˜6are nodal spectral displacements at the two ends. The termθis the non-dimensional bending flexibility of the plate along the crack edge. (The method to calculateθis given in Section 3.1) The quantitiesMxx1,Mxy1andQx1are the bending moments and shear force expressed in displacement terms, andMxx2,Mxy2,Qx2are obtained similarly. These boundary conditions can be expressed in the matrix form as(22)[M]{C}=[M10M2M30M4]{C}={u100u2}whereu1={q˜1,q˜2,q˜3}T,u2={q˜4,q˜5,q˜6}T,M1,M4∈ℂ3X6,M2,M3∈ℂ6X6andC={C1,C2}TThe shear force and bending moments at the left and right boundaries of the plate can be written as,(23){Vx1(0)Mxx1(0)Myy1(0)Vx2(L)Mxx2(L)Myy2(L)}={Q˜1M˜xx1M˜yy1Q˜2M˜xx2M˜yy2}=[P100P2]{C},P1,P2∈C3X6Sub-matricesMi,i=1,...,4andP1,P2can be found in the Appendix. Combining Eqs. (22) and (23),(24){Q˜1,M˜xx1,M˜yy1,Q˜2,M˜xx2,M˜yy2}T=[K˜]{u1u2}whereK˜is the frequency dependent dynamic stiffness matrix of the spectral plate element with transverse (open and non-propagating) crack and is given by(25)[K˜]=[P100P2][N1N4],whereN=[N1N2N3N4]=[M]−1Here the stiffness matrixK˜is a square matrix with dimensions of 6×6. The sub matrices Pj(j=1, 2) and Ni(i=1, …, 4) have dimensions of 6×12 and 12×3 consecutively.The bending flexibility of the plate with a crack can be expressed in dimensionless form [9,22–24] as,(26)θ(y¯)=(6HLy)αbb0f(y¯)F(y¯);y¯=yLywhereHis the thickness of the plate,F(y¯)is a correction function andαbb0is the dimensionless bending compliance coefficient at the crack center given by(27)αbb0=(1H)∫0h0ξ(1.99−2.47ξ+12.97ξ2−23.117ξ3+24.80ξ4)2dh,ξ=hHfor the range,0<ξ<0.7.

The crack shape functionf(y¯)is defined as,(28)f(y¯)=e−(y¯−y¯0)2(e2/2c¯2);c¯=cLy,y¯0=y0Lywhereeis the base of natural logarithm. The correction factorF(y¯)is given as,(29)F(y¯)=2c/H+3(ν+3)(1−ν)αbb0[1−f(y¯)]2c/H+3(ν+3)(1−ν)αbb0Fig. 3 presents the variation ofθfor a few different values of crack parameters.Now, in order to obtain the slope discontinuity (θ(y¯)Mxxin Eq. (20)) one would require the knowledge of bending moment at the crack location which is not known a priori. Therefore an initial assumption is made that the bending moment of the cracked plate is not greatly disturbed from that of the undamaged plate at the crack location. Using this, a first approximation of the displacement and stress field for the cracked plate can be obtained. This new result can be used again to replace Mxx, and this iteration can be continued until the convergence is achieved [24]. In this work, no iteration is performed as the objective is to show the qualitative change induced in the displacement field due to the presence of a crack.
