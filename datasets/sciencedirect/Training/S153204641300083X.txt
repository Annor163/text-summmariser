Older adults and mobile phones for health: A review

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We review the use of mobile phones for health applied to older adults.The field emerging field contains many feasibility studies with smaller samples.A variety of clinical domains are appropriate for mobile phone interventions.Future work should address generalizability and establish a stronger evidence base.

ObjectiveTo report on the results of a review concerning the use of mobile phones for health with older adults.MethodsPubMed and CINAHL were searched for articles using “older adults” and “mobile phones” along with related terms and synonyms between 1965 and June 2012. Identified articles were filtered by the following inclusion criteria: original research project utilizing a mobile phone as an intervention, involve/target adults 60years of age or older, and have an aim emphasizing the mobile phone’s use in health.ResultsTwenty-one different articles were found and categorized into ten different clinical domains, including diabetes, activities of daily life, and dementia care, among others. The largest group of articles focused on diabetes care (4 articles), followed by COPD (3 articles), Alzheimer’s/dementia Care (3 articles) and osteoarthritis (3 articles). Areas of interest studied included feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. While there were many different clinical domains, the majority of studies were pilot studies that needed more work to establish a stronger base of evidence.ConclusionsCurrent work in using mobile phones for older adult use are spread across a variety of clinical domains. While this work is promising, current studies are generally smaller feasibility studies, and thus future work is needed to establish more generalizable, stronger base of evidence for effectiveness of these interventions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
New technologies and innovations have promised to make tasks faster, safer, and more efficient and effective. Technological innovations have already been used to bridge health disparities and meet unmet needs of populations [1]. While many previous systems were constructed with clinical professionals and healthcare administration in mind, there has recently been an increasing interest in applying these new technologies to consumer health, empowering patients to take control and play an active role in managing their health. Consumer health technology interventions have been used, for example, to help individuals monitor their own health [2], to provide information and social support [3,4] and for remote home monitoring [5].One example of a technology that can potentially support a consumer health focus includes mobile phones. Within the United States, an increasing number of people are subscribing to mobile telephony services, rising from 44.2% penetration in 2001 [6] to 83% penetration in 2011 [7] in American adults. The growth of mobile phones has led to a scenario where mobile phones are considered ubiquitous among the population. In fact, even older adults, who as a subpopulation may be viewed generally as technological laggards, have also been obtaining mobile phones at increased rates. As of 2012, 69% of older adults aged 65 or older owned a cell phone [8]. Consequently, older adults are more likely to own a mobile phone than a desktop (48%) or laptop computer (32%) [8]. This suggests that if system designers were to select a technology platform that would reach the majority of older adults, mobile phones would be ideal due to their high penetrance rate.Over the next 20years, the number of adults aged 65years or older in the United States is projected to grow briskly, rising from 40million in 2010 to 72 million in 2030 [9]. As an individual ages, there is an increased likelihood of having a multiple health problems or comorbidities [10], which leads to an increasing need for health and/or disease management interventions. While medications may be part of the intervention, they cannot help with other activities, such as lifestyle changes and health monitoring. For example, previous interventions include smart homes for health monitoring [11,12], videophones for telehealth applications [13], and sensors for fall detection and mobility [14,15]. These demographic trends, combined with the growth of mobile phone telephony among the older adult population, suggest that using the mobile phone as a platform for interventions in health may be a viable way forward.Given the rapid growth of mobile phones, and its potential as a platform for improving the health of older adults, along with the projected growth of population, it is important to examine current evidence of use of mobile phones by older adults for health purposes (including communication, education, and health monitoring), and understand gaps and challenges in order to inform the design of future systems given the ubiquity of mobile phones. The purpose of this literature review was to examine the current state of mobile phone use for health related interventions targeting older adults.
