@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Robotic systems have inherently nonlinear phenomena as joints undergo sliding and/or rotating. This in turn requires that the system running states be predicted correctly. This paper makes a full analysis of the robot states by applying observer-based adaptive wavelet neural network (OBAWNN) tracking control scheme to tackle these phenomena such as system uncertainties, multiple time-delayed state uncertainties, and external disturbances such that the closed loop system signals must obey uniform ultimate boundedness and achieve H∞ tracking performance. The recurrent adaptive wavelet neural network model is used to approximate the dynamics of the robotic system, while an observer-based adaptive control scheme is to stabilize the system. The advantage of employing adaptive wavelet neural dynamics is that we can utilize the neuron information by activation functions to on-line tune the hidden-to-output weights, and the adaptation parameters to estimate the robot parameters and the bounds of the gains of delay states directly using linear analytical results. It is shown that the stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by some sufficient conditions derived from Lyapunov criterion and Riccati-inequality. Finally, a numerical example of a three-links rolling cart is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The geometric and reconfigurable properties provide robots great flexibility in motion maneuverability. The robot systems may be adapted to many different applications and uncertain environments including undersea, medicine, construction, and defense [1–11]. Motion planning in robots is to maneuver the end-effector by joints along a prespecified trajectory. As joints’ angles change largely in robot systems with one or more bases (e.g., serial or parallel manipulators) or no fixed base (e.g., snake-like or rolling-like robots), the motions of robots with full range maneuver may include intentional and unintentional behaviors in sliding and/or rotating motions during the execution of practical tasks. Sliding and rotation may be utilized as a means of mobility, and, hence, the dynamic control of these motions becomes an important topic of study. In [3], the authors proposed the linearization theory and proportional feedback control technique for robotic system motion control. Furthermore, extensive literature on motion planning in robot systems has focused on kinematic systems in which the robot's motion can be described by a differential equation that is linear in the inputs. In general, the dynamic equations of motion can be formulated by several methods, e.g., the Newton and Euler laws, the principle of d’Alembert or Hamilton, and the Lagrange's equations of motion. Among these methods, the Newton–Euler approach produces a large of nonlinear equations, although these equations can be solved simultaneously for all the forces with holonomic constrains [1], and with poorly understood models and disturbances [2] for motion/force tracking control. Usually, an n-links robot system can be modeled with Lagrange's equations since the Lagrangian approach can eliminate the force of constrains at the outset [3]. However, the equations are too complicated for control design purpose.Recently, the neural-network-based control technique has been an alternative design method for various control systems to compensate the effects of unknown nonlinear uncertainties and external disturbances so that the system stability can be guaranteed as well as the convergence and robustness of the control system can be improved [4–7]. In addition, this technique can approximate nonlinear plant dynamics accurately through parallel and distributed learning processing [8] or by using the linear matrix inequality fuzzy Lyapunov method for nonlinear time-delay systems [9,10]. Wavelets have been combined with the neural network to create wavelet neural networks (WNNs) because the training algorithms for WNN typically converge using a smaller number of iterations than the conventional neural networks [12–16]. Unlike the sigmoid functions used in conventional neural networks, the wavelet function in the second layer of WNN consists of translation and dilation parameters to enrich the mapping relationship between inputs and outputs [12], using neural weighting-dependent approach to guarantee stability for time-delay neural systems [14], using delay independent criterion for multiple time-delay systems [15], or using modified wavelet neural network in function approximation to predict time-series pollution data [16].There has been considerable interest in exploring the applications of WNN to deal with nonlinearity and uncertainties of real-time servo control systems [17–26]. A number of WNN-based controllers have been proposed using artificial neural networks and wavelet decomposition with learning capability without any precise structure for controlling the mobile robots [26], using risk control decision models for natural disasters [27], or using GA-based adaptive neural network controllers for nonlinear systems [28]. Furthermore, output feedback control scheme with neural adaptive observer was proposed in [29,30], and the former also used the condition of linear dependence upon unknown parameters that has been removed by introducing UFAs such as fuzzy systems and neural networks in the observer structure. Their schemes require strictly positive real (SPR) conditions on the estimation error dynamics and Meyer–Kalman–Yakubovic (MKY) lemma. In general, the observation error dynamics does not satisfy the SPR condition. For this reason, a low-pass filter is needed such that the system can satisfy the SPR condition associated with the Lyapunov stability analysis. Nevertheless, the filtering of the basis vectors of UFAs will make the dynamic order of the observer very large.Besides the nonlinearities and uncertainties, robot systems often include unknown delayed states when link transmits energy or moment to the next due to inertia effect. Hence, the states with delayed uncertainties should be included in the dynamical system for stability analysis in the control system design (see, e.g., [32,36–40] and the references therein). However, they are all based on the assumption that the bounds of the delayed state uncertainties are exactly known. Due to the complexity of the structure on uncertainties, delayed uncertainty bounds may not be easily obtained. Zhang [12] had applied wavelet theory for nonlinear system identification, but their approach utilized a wavelet basis as a universal function approximator with a neural network to determine the resolution and the translation coefficients of the wavelet. By utilizing the universal approximation property along with the direct decomposition, multiresolution, and orthogonality properties associated with certain wavelets, we demonstrate that wavelets have certain properties sufficient for correct parameter estimation under passive learning schemes and develop a system approximation method for wavelet approximators.By avoiding complicated Lagrange's equations, we adopt an observer-based adaptive wavelet neural network (OBAWNN) tracking control scheme in this paper using a new simplify model using linear analytical results instead of estimating nonlinear system functions to approximate the robot system dynamics. It is assumed that the state delay times are known a priori, but the bounds of the gains of delay states are not known. Based on Lyapunov criterion and Riccati-inequality, some sufficient conditions based on the proposed control scheme are derived so that all states of the system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the effect of the external disturbance on the tracking error can be attenuated to any prescribed level and consequently an H∞ tracking control is achieved. Finally, a numerical example of a three-link rolling robot as compared to our previous work [13] is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the dynamics of robot manipulators. Section 3 presents the estimation using wavelet neural network. Section 4 presents the observer-based adaptive control design and analyzes the stability of the closed-loop system in the Lyapunov sense. The rolling robot with three links for rolling motion is simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in Section 5. Finally, conclusion is given in Section 6.Consider the dynamical equation of an n-link robotic manipulator subject to a lumped disturbance and delayed states described by the following nonlinear differential equation:(1)H(q)q¨(t)+C′(q,q˙)q˙(t)+g′(q)=τ(t)+∑j=1bψj′(t)q(t−hj)+d′(t)(2)q(t)=φ(t),t∈[−h,0]whereH(q) is the n×n symmetric positive definite inertial matrix,C′(q,q˙)q˙is the n×1 vector of coupled Coriolis and centripetal torques,g′(q) is the n×1 vector of gravitational torques,τis the n×1 vector of joint torques,q=[q1q2⋯qn]⊤ is the vector of the joint displacement, andq¨andq˙are the vectors of the joint acceleration and velocity terms, respectively. Further,φ(t) is a continuous vector-valued initial function,h=max{hj,j=1,2,…,b},ψj′(t),j=1,2,…,b, are nonlinear time-varying continuous functions which represent the gains of the delayed state uncertainties for the system since each link transmitting energy or moment to the following links will have delayed behavior due to inertia effect, and are assumed to be bounded. It is assumed that only joint vectorqis measurable andd′∈L2[0, T], ∀T∈[0, ∞). The followings are the properties of the robotic dynamics:(P1) The inertia matrixH(q) is symmetric positive-definite for everyq. BothH(q) andH(q)−1 are uniformly bounded.(P2) The matrixH˙(q)−2C′(q,q˙)is skew-symmetric for suitable representation ofC′(q,q˙).(P3)C′(q,q˙)is bounded inqand linear inq˙.From (P1), (P2), and (P3), the differential equation of the manipulator (1) can be written as(3)q¨(t)+C(q,q˙)q˙(t)+g(q)=B(q)τ(t)+∑j=1bΨj(t)q(t−hj)+d(t)whereC(q,q˙)=H(q)−1C′(q,q˙),g(q)=H(q)−1g′(q),Ψj=H(q)−1ψj′,B(q)=H(q)−1, andd(t)=H(q)−1d′(t). From property (P1) and boundness assumption ofψj′, it can be assumed thatΨjis bounded, i.e., ∥Ψj∥≤βj, ∀j, where βjis unknown but positive constant and ∥·∥ is the Euclidean norm of ·. To simplify the notation, the argument t is in many cases dropped out.Define the output tracking error as(4)e1=q−qrwhereqris the desired reference output. Letx=[x1⊤x2⊤]⊤=[q⊤q˙⊤]⊤,e=[e1⊤e2⊤]=[e1⊤e˙1⊤]⊤, andxr=[qr⊤q˙r⊤]⊤. Then, we havee=x−xrand the error dynamics can be given from (3) by:(5)e˙=A0e+B0(f(x)+B(q)τ−q¨r+∑j=1bΨj(t)q(t−hj)+d)wheref(x)=C(q,q˙)q˙(t)+g(q)and(6)A0=0(n)I(n)0(n)0(n),B0=0(n)I(n)for which 0(n) andI(n) denote the zero and identity matrices, respectively, with dimensions n×n. For convenience, we define(7)ϑk=βk2Hence, ϑkis obviously an unknown positive constant. Defineϑˆkas the estimate of the unknown bound ϑkand the error gain of the delayed state uncertainties asϑ˜k=ϑˆk−ϑk.The purpose of the paper is to synthesize an observer-based adaptive wavelet neural network tracking control scheme so that the system outputqcan asymptotically track a given desired outputqrin the sense of H∞ tracking performance within a prescribed value ρ in the presence of the unknown delayed state uncertainties and the external disturbances, and all signals in the overall system are UUB.From (3) and (5), the system functionsf(x) andB(q) will change accordingly as the end-effector moves to track the desired trajectory since they are functions of the actuated jointsqof the robotic system. In order to achieve trajcetory tracking efficiently, a four-layer wavelet neural network (WNN) shown in Fig. 1, which comprises an input layer, a mother wavelet layer, and an inference wavelet layer, and an output layer, is introduced to perform the nonlinear functions in the transform domain to achieve model reconstruction. Since WNN can be represented as the universal approximations from the viewpoint of human experts, they can uniformly approximate nonlinear continuous functions to arbitrary accuracy over a relatively wide range of operating conditions [35]. Furthermore, multidimensional wavelet functions can be generalized as a set of one-dimensional wavelet functions instead of really implementing the regular frame [12]. The inputs of the WNN are the states of the joints in mechanism and the output of the WNN is an estimated value of the unknown dynamic function. A family of wavelets is constructed by translations and dilations performed on a single fixed function called the mother wavelet. In this subsection, the superscript denotes the number of layer. As for the input layer, let(8)yi1=zi,i=1,2,…,N1where zi's are the inputs of the WNN for which N1 is the total number input nodes. For the mother wavelet layer, we adopt the first derivative of the Gaussian function as the mother wavelet function as follows:(9)yij2=ϕyi1−mijσij=−yi1−mijσijexp−12yi1−mijσij2for j=1, 2, …, N2, where mijand σijare the translation and dilation, respectively, in the ijth term of the ith inputyi1to the node of wavelet layer, and N2 is the total number of the wavelets with respect to the respective input node. Hence, the gradient ofyij2with respect to mijand σijcan be obtained as:(10)∂yij2∂mij=∂ϕ((yi1−mij)/σij)∂mij=−1yi1−mij+yi1−mijσij2yij2(11)∂yij2∂σij=∂ϕ((yi1−mij)/σij)∂σij=−1σij+(yi1−mij)2σij3yij2respectively, which lead to algebraic solutions. For the inference wavelet layer, we take the product of mono-dimensional wavelets with respect to the input node as follows:(12)yi3=∏j=1N2yij2As for the output layer, we compute the overall output as the summation of all input signals as follows:(13)y4=∑i=1N1ζiyi3=ζ⊤ωwhere y4 can be used to estimate the nonlinear dynamic functionsf(x) andB(q), the connecting weightζ=[ζ1ζ2⋯ζN1]⊤∈ℝN1×1is the tunable output action strength of the output associated with the waveletω=[y13y23⋯yN13]⊤∈ℝN1×1, andyi3represents the ith input to the node of output layer.As to estimate the n and n2 elements inf(x) andB(q), respectively, by using the wavelet neural network, we have N1=2n andzi=qi,zn+i=q˙i,i=1,2…,n, forf(x), and N1=n and zi=qi, i=1, 2…, n, forB(q). Letfˆ=[fˆ1fˆ2⋯fˆn]⊤andBˆ=[Bˆjℓ]be the estimates offandB, respectively,ζf=[ζf1⊤ζf2⊤⋯ζfn⊤]⊤∈ℝ(2n2)×1,ζB=[ζBiℓ]∈ℝ(n2)×nthe tunable output vectors, andΩf(x)=diag{ωf1⊤,⋯,ωfn⊤}∈ℝn×(2n2),ΩB(q)=diag{ωB⊤,⋯,ωB⊤}∈ℝn×(n2)the output vector of wavelet layers. Then, we have(14)fˆj(x)=ωfj⊤(x)ζfj,j=1,2…,n(15)Bˆjℓ(q)=ωBjℓ⊤(q)ζBjℓ,j,ℓ=1,2…,nHence,(16)fˆ(x)=Ωf(x)ζf(17)Bˆ(q)=ΩB(q)ζBFollowing the Stone–Wiestrass theorem and Kolmogorov theorems [34], iff˜=f(x)−fˆ(x,ζf)andB˜=B(q)−Bˆ(q,ζB)are the NN approximation errors, then for any arbitrary positive bounded constants ϵf, ϵB, there exist N1 inputs and N2 layers such that(18)∥f˜∥≤ϵf,∥B˜∥≤ϵBfor allx1,x2∈Xn⊂ℝn.Many wavelet functions have been reported in the literature [33] that have remarkable results in approximating nonlinear unknown functions. Which one is the most suitable basis in practical application depends on particular design specifications. The estimations given by (16) and (17) forfˆandBˆ, respectively, call for proper adjustments of the translationsmˆf=[mˆf1⊤mˆf2⊤⋯mˆf2n⊤]⊤∈ℝ(2n)×N2,mˆB=[mˆB1⊤mˆB2⊤⋯mˆBn⊤]⊤∈ℝn×N2and dilationsσˆf=[σˆf1⊤σˆf2⊤⋯σˆf2n⊤]⊤∈ℝ(2n)×N2,σˆB=[σˆB1⊤σˆB2⊤⋯σˆBn⊤]⊤∈ℝn×N2, wheremˆfi=[mˆfi1mˆfi2⋯mˆfiN2]⊤∈ℝN2×1,mˆBi=[mˆBi1mˆBi2⋯mˆBiN2]⊤∈ℝN2×1,σˆfi=[σˆfi1σˆfi2⋯σˆfiN2]⊤∈ℝN2×1, andσˆBi=[σˆBi1σˆBi2⋯σˆBiN2]⊤∈ℝN2×1. For a small translation and a large dilation, the convergence of WNN parameters can be guaranteed but the convergent speed is very slow. On the other hand, if the translation is too large and the dilation is too small, the parameter convergence may become more unstable. In order to train the WNN parameters efficiently, the optimal estimators for translation and dilation will be derived to achieve the fast convergence of output tracking error. In order to tune the translations and dilations to achieve favorable estimation of the system dynamic function, the Taylor expansion linearization technique is employed to transform the nonlinear functionsΩ˜fandΩ˜Binto partially linear forms. Then, we have(19)Ω˜f=Efm_˜f+Ofσ_˜f+Rf(20)Ω˜B=EBm_˜B+OBσ_˜B+RBwhereEf=diag{∂ωf⊤∂mf⋯∂ωf⊤∂mf}|mf=mˆf∈ℝn×(4n4N2),m_˜f=diag{m˜f⋯m˜f}∈ℝ(4n4N2)×(2n2),EB=diag{∂ωB⊤∂mB⋯∂ωB⊤∂mB}|mB=mˆB∈ℝn×(n4N2),m_˜B=diag{m˜B⋯m˜B}∈ℝ(n4N2)×(n2),Of=diag{∂ωf⊤∂σf⋯∂ωf⊤∂σf}|σf=σˆf∈ℝn×(4n4N2),σ_˜f=diag{σ˜f⋯σ˜f}∈ℝ(4n4N2)×(2n2),OB=diag{∂ωB⊤∂σB⋯∂ωB⊤∂σB}|σB=σˆB∈ℝn×(n4N2),σ_˜B=diag{σ˜B⋯σ˜B}∈ℝ(n4N2)×(n2), andRf,RBare matrices of higher order terms, for which(21)∂ωf⊤∂mf=∂ωf1∂mf⊤⋯∂ωf2n∂mf⊤(2nN2)×(2nN2)(22)∂ωf⊤∂σf=∂ωf1∂σf⊤⋯∂ωf2n∂σf⊤(2nN2)×(2nN2)(23)∂ωB⊤∂mB=∂ωB1∂mB⊤⋯∂ωBn∂mB⊤(nN2)×(nN2)(24)∂ωB⊤∂σB=∂ωB1∂σB⊤⋯∂ωBn∂σB⊤(nN2)×(nN2)are the Jacobian matrices that mapm˜f,σ˜fandm˜B,σ˜BtoΩ˜fandΩ˜B, respectively, by calculating (10) and (11), and their ℓth elements can be represented as(25)∂ωfℓ∂mf⊤=0(ℓ−1)×N2⊤∂yfℓ3∂mfℓ1⋯∂yfℓ3∂mℓN2⊤0(2n−ℓ)×N2⊤(26)∂ωfℓ∂σf⊤=0(ℓ−1)×N2⊤∂yfℓ3∂σfℓ1⋯∂yfℓ3∂σfℓN2⊤0(2n−ℓ)×N2⊤(27)∂ωfℓ∂mf⊤=0(ℓ−1)×N2⊤∂yfℓ3∂mfℓ1⋯∂yfℓ3∂mℓN2⊤0(2n−ℓ)×N2⊤(28)∂ωfℓ∂σf⊤=0(ℓ−1)×N2⊤∂yfℓ3∂σfℓ1⋯∂yfℓ3∂σfℓN2⊤0(2n−ℓ)×N2⊤respectively.Since the dynamics of the plant is highly nonlinear and the system states can not be cannot be directly available for feedback, a set of neural networks (i.e., a dynamic high-pass filter [30,31]) which will be defined later is employed to reconstruct the unavailable signals since they can offer the advantage of performance improvement through learning using parallel and distributed processing signalsewith realizable filters.Letxˆandeˆbe the state estimations ofxande, respectively, wherexˆ=[xˆ1⊤xˆ2⊤]⊤=[qˆ⊤qˆ˙⊤]⊤andeˆ=[eˆ1⊤eˆ2⊤]=[eˆ1⊤eˆ˙1⊤]⊤for whicheˆ1=xˆ1−qr. Then, the observer-based adaptive WNN (AWNN) tracking control law can be given by(29)τ=Bˆ−1(qˆ)(−fˆ(xˆ)−Keˆ−q¨r+τh+τs+τd)whereKis chosen such that the eigenvalues of the matrixA1≜A0−B0Kare all with negative real part, andτh,τs,τdare compensators described later for uncertainties, disturbances, and delay gain uncertainties, respectively. From (5) and (29), we have(30)e˙=A0e+B0(f(x)−fˆ(xˆ)+∑j=1bΨj(t)q(t−hj)−Keˆ+(B(q)−Bˆ(qˆ))τ+τh+τs+τd+d)For (30), we design the following observer to estimate the tracking error vector:(31)eˆ˙=A0eˆ−B0Keˆ+Ko(u−uˆ)uˆ=C0eˆwhereC0=[I(n) 0(n)] andKois chosen such that the eigenvalues of the matrixA2≜A0+KoC0 are all with negative real part. Then, by replacing the state estimates, we have from (16) and (17)(32)fˆ(xˆ)=fˆ(eˆ+xr)=Ωf(eˆ+xr)ζˆf=Ωˆfζˆf(33)Bˆ(qˆ)=Bˆ(eˆ1+qr)=ΩB(eˆ1+qr)ζˆB=ΩˆBζˆBAccording to the universal approximation theorem, there exist both optimal approximation parametersζf*andζB*such thatfˆ*(xˆ)andBˆ*(xˆ)can approximatef(x) andB(q), respectively, as close as possible. That is,(34)f(x)=fˆ*(eˆ+xr)+ϵf=Ωf(eˆ+xr)ζf*+ϵf(35)B(q)=Bˆ*(eˆ1+qr)+ϵB=ΩB(eˆ1+qr)ζB*+ϵBwhere(36)ζf*=argminζf∈Uf{supx∈Ux,eˆ+xr∈Ueˆ+xr∥fˆ(eˆ+xr)−f(x)∥}(37)ζB*=argminζB∈UB{supq∈Uq,eˆ1+qr∈Ueˆ1+qr∥Bˆ(eˆ1+qr)−B(q)∥}for whichUx,Uxˆ,Uf, and UBare suitable closed sets. Further, we define the estimated parameter errors asζ˜f≜ζf−ζf*andζ˜B≜ζB−ζB*.Let the observation error be defined ase˜≜e−eˆ. Then, we havee˜=x−xr−(xˆ−xr)=x−xˆ, and from (19), (20), (30), and (31))(38)e˜˙=(A0−KoC0)e˜+B0(f(x)−fˆ(eˆ+xr)+∑j=1bΨj(t)q(t−hj)+(B(q)−Bˆ(eˆ1+qr))τ+τh+τs+τd+d)=(A0−KoC0)e˜+B0(−Ωˆfζ˜f+Ω˜fζ˜f*+∑j=1bΨj(t)q(t−hj)+(−ΩˆBζ˜B+Ω˜Bζ˜B*+ϵB)τ+ϵf+d+τd+τh+τs)whereΩ˜f=Ωf−ΩˆfandΩ˜B=ΩB−ΩˆB.From (38), since ideal differentiators are physically unrealizable which leads to unavailable derivative signalsefor measurement, we could not obtain all the elements ofeas well ase˜. Hence, output estimation error is filtered by a stable filter and the filtered signal is used to update the neural parameters [17,41]. The filter denoted by L(s) is of the form(39)L(s)=λ2n(s+λ)2nwhere λ>0 is the constant to be determined.

The dynamic equation (40) is used for parameter estimation. It is assumed that the filtered signal is bounded and satisfies|βF|≤κβF, whereκβFis a given positive constant.

Therefore, whenever(65)∥e¯∥≥ρd⊤d+ϑb∑j=1bxr⊤(t−hj)xr(t−hj)λmin(Q˜)we haveV˙≤0. In light of Lyapunov stability theory of the retarded functional differential equation [43], since ρ is the design constant serving as an attenuation level, it can be concluded from (65) that for anyt≥t0,e¯,Ω˜f,Ω˜B, andϑ˜(t)are UUB in the presence of the delayed state uncertainties∑j=1bΨj(t)q(t−hj)and the external disturbanced[44].

In addition, when one decreases the parameter ρ sufficiently, then the upper bound on the steady-state errorse¯(t)can be made as small as possible. In addition, the system designer can tune the size of the residual set by adjusting properly the parameters ν which are used in (56).In this section, a rolling robot with three-links for rolling motion control represented schematically in Fig. 3is used for simulation. The rolling moment is a complex nonlinear function of the rolling angle, rolling rate, angle of attack and sideslip angle. It is assumed that the cart motion has a fixed forward velocityv1, the ith controllable heading angles qi, and a nonholonomic prohibiting slippage perpendicular to the central axis of the cart, and the ith link perpendicular signed distance to the desired trajectory Di(t) (Diis negative when the desired trajectory is to the right of the actual trajectory and vice versa). The nonlinear rolling cart equation of motion for a single-link cart has been developed by McIsaac and Ostrowski [3]. Similar to [3], we model the rolling cart as a planar, serial chain of three identical links connected by three rotational joints with mass m=0.1kg and inertia J=0.2kg·m2. The length of the three links is the same and is 0.1m, the desired trajectory is a straight lineqDi=20(m), and the rolling cart follows this line, and the boundary conditions for the rolling cart system are restrict to be −π/6≤qi≤π/6 and−π/9≤q˙i≤π/9(rad/s), i=1, 2, 3. The velocity ofv1is kept at 10 (m/s). The three-links rolling cart motion dynamics are given by(67)D˙i=visin(qi−qDi),q˙i=ci+gi(qi)τi+di′for i=1, 2, 3, wherev1=10,c1=0, and g1=5(1+0.1exp(−0.4D1−0.5q1)), andvi=vi−1cos(qi−qi−1)−(ℓi/2)q˙i−1sin(qi−qi−1),ci=(2/ℓi)vi−1sin(qi−1−qi)−q˙i−1cos(qi−1−qi), and gi=5(1+0.1exp(−0.4Di−0.5qi)), i=2, 3. Furthermore, τiis the control inputs, and diis the external disturbance and is assumed to satisfy di∈L2[0, T], ∀T∈[0, ∞), i=1, 2, 3. It is assumed that delays between links for control signal propagation are the same and are taken as h=0.5 (s). So, b=3. From (67), we have(68)D¨i=v˙isin(qi−qDi)+civicos(qi−qDi)+ψi(t)qi(t−h)+gi(qi)vicos(qi−qDi)τi+di′vicos(qi−qDi)=fi+ψi(t)qi(t−h)+Biτi+diwherefi=v˙isin(qi−qDi)+civicos(qi−qDi), Bi=gi(qi)vicos(qi−qDi),di=di′vicos(qi−qDi), and ψi(t)≤β, for whichdi′=2sin(t)and β is an unknown but positive constant.Define the output tracking error ase1=D−DD=[D1D2D3]3×1⊤−[DD1DD2DD3]3×1⊤, whereDDiis the desired ith link perpendicular signed output reference distance, and the tracking error vector as(69)e=[e1⊤e˙1⊤]⊤=[e1⊤e2⊤]⊤=x−xrwherex=[x1⊤x2⊤]6×1⊤=[D⊤D˙⊤]6×1⊤andxr=[DD⊤D˙D⊤]6×1⊤. Letf=[f1f2f3]⊤,B=diag{B1,B2,B3},τ=[τ1τ2τ3]⊤,ψ¯(t)=diag{ψ1(t)ψ2(t)ψ3(t)}, andd=[d1d2d3]⊤. Hence, we can have the following tracking error dynamic equation(70)e˙=A0e+B0(f+Bτ−q¨r+ψ¯(t)q(t−h)+d)where(71)A0=0(3)I(3)0(3)0(3),B0=0(3)I(3),C0=[I(3)0(3)]The filter L(s) is determined as L(s)=64/(s+2)6. How do we synthesize an observer-based adaptive wavelet neural network tracking control schemeτso that the system outputDcan asymptotically track a given desired outputDDin the sense of H∞ tracking performance within a prescribed value ρ in the presence of the unknown uncertain parameters, the unknown delayed state uncertainties, and the external disturbances, and all signals in the overall system are UUB ?According to the design algorithm, the observer-based neural adaptive control design to achieve H∞ tracking performance is given by the followings: First, selectΓ=1,κf=0.01,κB=0.01,κβF=2.5,γσf=0.1,γσB=0.1,γmf=0.1, andγmB=0.1. The initial conditions for system are chosen asq(0)=0 and parameter estimationsζˆf(0)=ζˆB(0)=ϑˆ(0)=m_ˆf(0)=m_ˆB(0)=σ_ˆf(0)=σ_ˆB(0)=0.1. The input of the wavelet neural network is the link perpendicular signed distance. Hence, we have n=3. The wavelet neural network used in the study can be characterized with the number of elements in layers N1=2×n=6 for estimationfand N1=n=3 forB, and the number of the Wavelets N2=5.Next, select the feedback gain and observer gain vectorsK1=[0.1 2],K2=K3=[0.01 1], andKo1=[10.5]⊤,Ko2=Ko3=[10.01]⊤, respectively. Hence,K=diag{K1,K2,K3}3×6andKo=diag{Ko1,Ko2,Ko3}6×3such that the magnitudes of the observer poles are larger than those of the controller poles and the characteristic matricesA0−B0KandA0−KoC0 have roots all with negative real parts.We choose the prescribed attenuation levels 0.3 and 0.1 for performance comparisons and the weighting matrices asQi=I(4n), ν=0.3, γh=0.1, the update rates γi=0.001, and the prescribed attenuation levels ρi=0.3, i=1, 2, 3, such that the Riccati-like Eq. (56) has a positive definite symmetric matrixP=diag{P1,P2,P3}, whereP1=0.60491.45120.20430.16521.45125.04790.69540.61490.20430.69540.27040.22670.16520.61490.22670.4614,P2=0.66591.94150.25070.19231.94158.76311.10370.92620.25071.10370.31930.27460.19230.92620.27460.4997P3=0.66591.94150.25070.19231.94158.76311.10370.92620.25071.10370.31930.27460.19230.92620.27460.4997andQi=I(4n), ν=0.3, γi=0.0009, and ρi=0.1, i=1, 2, 3, such thatP=diag{P1,P2,P3}, whereP1=0.24330.15430.22630.16310.15430.16640.15420.17070.22630.15420.22930.16400.16310.17070.16400.1821,P2=1.02704.81320.20130.17624.813234.57121.10321.04000.20131.10320.22180.19560.17621.04000.19560.4347P3=1.02704.81320.20130.17624.813234.57121.10321.04000.20131.10320.22180.19560.17621.04000.19560.4347In order to have a good approximation of threshold on initial parameter errors, we chooseνi=0.3,γfi=0.9,γgi=0.9,γBiℓ=0.9,i,ℓ=1,2,3. Then, calculate Mfand MBfrom (21)–(28) by way of (10) and (11).Finally, the observer-based indirect adaptive neural H∞ tracking control law (29) can be obtained from (48)–(50), whereτh=−10.001e¯⊤PB˜,τs=−4αsgn(B˜⊤Pe¯), andτd=−10.3ϑˆB˜⊤Pe¯, for whichα=0.3+0.5∥−fˆ(xˆ)−qr−Keˆ∥+0.05. Then compute the adaptive laws (43) and (44) to adjust the parameter vectorsωfiandωgi,i=1,2,3, and gain of delayed state uncertainties from (51).For performance comparisons, Figs. 4–23are simulation results for the prescribed attenuation levels 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. Figs. 13 and 23 show the responses of the control inputs for the prescribed attenuation levels 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. From the responses of distances and angles of the error dynamic and estimated error dynamic shown in Figs. 6–8 for the attenuation level 0.3, and Figs. 16–18 for the prescribed attenuation level 0.1, the H∞ tracking purpose for the latter case can be achieved effectively than the former case. In addition, the maximum steady state tracking errors of the first, second, and third links are 4.2%, 2.6%, and 2.1% for the prescribed attenuation level 0.3, respectively, and that of the first, second, and third links are 2.4%, 1.7%, and 1.5% for the prescribed attenuation level 0.1, respectively. However, as can be seen in (56) and compared Fig. 13 with Fig. 23, more larger control inputs are needed for smaller the prescribed attenuation level while maintaining satisfactory tracking responses. The responses of the learning gain of delayed state uncertainties are quite satisfactory (refer to Figs. 9 and 19). As compared Figs. 6–8 with Figs. 16–18, the time-varying disturbances are absorbed partly into the neural system and the estimates can be obtained more accurately. The responses of the estimates of the delayed state uncertainties for the uncertain plant converge and do not drift to infinity due to strong compensation of the estimation algorithms for the gains of the delayed state uncertainties. As compared with our previous work [13] with two-links rolling robot example, since there are 60 fuzzy IF-THEN rules with three links, the maximum steady state tracking errors of the first and second links are the same, but the third link is 2.42% and 1.65% for the prescribed attenuation level 0.3 and 0.1, respectively, which is larger than that of the proposed OBAWNN tracking control scheme, since more computational requirement for more fuzzy inference rules is required than that by using dynamic neural networks for complex coupled dynamics of the rolling robot with three-links for rolling motion control. In addition, the proposed control scheme derived from these estimates iteratively for achieving H∞ tracking purpose using smaller the prescribed attenuation level has the ability to stabilize the controlled plant and has better performance than that using larger the prescribed attenuation level. In other words, the use of the neural system with adaptation weights can indeed improve the performance of the closed-loop system using smaller the prescribed attenuation level (see Figs. 6–9 and 16–19 for both cases).The main reason of the result is that the only use of updating law for delayed state uncertainties cannot achieve an excellent tracking result as the system is subject to the controlled plant with plant uncertainties (since the plant dynamics are configuration dependent) and time-varying disturbances. This is one of the important motivation for the study. The results reveal that the proposed control scheme indeed improves the system performances including convergence of the estimations and tracking errors, the smoothness of the control inputs, and easy selection of the parameters of the estimations. It seems that the robustness of the proposed control scheme is excellent. In summary, the control input is bounded, and the estimations of the control scheme and the gain of the delayed state uncertainty will gradually approach a steady state in which the plant follows the reference input with faster rising time, little oscillations and tracking errors, and has a rather good dynamical performance. The performance indices are defined asIi=ei12+e˙i12,i=1,2,3, and they are shown for the proposed control scheme in Figs. 24–26, respectively, and that for the proposed control scheme without wavelets in Figs. 27–29, respectively. It is shown that the proposed control scheme can achieve favorable tracking performance, and the better tracking performance can be achieved as specified attenuation level is chosen smaller.Remark 5.1The above simulations indicate that the control scheme by properly selecting the the attenuation level and by using neural networks in this example for each state can guarantee that the tracking errore(t) converges to the neighborhood of zero if the disturbances and uncertainties exist. Using the proposed control scheme with dynamical adaptation capability for weights can significantly reduce the amount of the neurons with excellent robustness for achieving H∞ tracking performance.
