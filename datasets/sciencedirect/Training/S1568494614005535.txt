@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Preventing GSM subscribers to move to another operator is an important and crucial issue for the GSM operators. Churn management is of essential importance in detecting loyal and hopeless subscribers. Keeping current GSM number when changing the GSM operator also facilitates these subscribers to switch to another operator. Euclidean Indexing High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) method is a polynomial based modeling method which is used to predict the churner behavior of the GSM subscribers. An up-to-date data set consists of demographic information and call details records with the related churn behavior is used to model the churner detection problem. The proposed method uses 640 randomly selected training nodes for the modeling process while 316 nodes are used to examine the performance of the proposed method and to make comparisons with the data mining techniques.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the last decade, the telecommunication sector has shown substantial growth in Turkey and World Markets. GSM number moving process was approved by Turkish Telecommunications Authority at the end of 2008. Using this opportunity, the GSM subscriber can change his/her GSM Operator without loosing his/her current number. This occasion for the subscribers may turn out to be a threat or an opportunity for GSM operators. Loyal and hopeless subscribers were defined for identifying the customers who wish to change their service from one to another GSM operator [1]. Probably, hopeless subscribers will drive their way to another GSM operator without changing their GSM number. To prevent hopeless subscribers’ movement, campaign and churn management mechanisms have to be triggered. For this reason, sort of different data mining techniques have been facilitated to manage churner activities. Churner behaviors have been analyzed to obtain predictive models for campaign and churn management. Bayesian Belief Network is used to determine the casual relations between the factors that affect customer churn [2]. Later, alternative promotions were offered to the customers in order to retain them. Alternative profit centric approach was developed to assess the churn prediction models [3]. They found that small number of attributes are enough to accurately predict churners.C4.5 and SVM are implemented for customer churn prediction and these two methods have satisfactory results [4]. Random Forest and PSO based data balancing tools with some feature selection strategies are used in churn prediction [5]. To provide an effective churn management for telecom industries, a study uses fuzzy correlation analysis to extract the key factors of telecom churn management processes [6].As mentioned above, different data mining methods are utilized from different attributes of the call detail records. The feature selection operations show that churn behavior may be segmented with different subscriber characteristics. Also, customer engagement behavior can be enforced by promotions for eliminating the churner activities. An approach underlines that GSM operators have to reach their highly engaged subscribers to maximize benefits and minimize the churn rates [7]. From this viewpoint, highly engaged subscribers can be detected by churn prediction models based on subscribers’ behaviors by using call detail records.All these works emphasize the importance of churn prediction in the telecommunication industry to retain the customers and prevent operator changes by using data mining techniques. Besides churn prediction, the intelligent algorithm models are very important techniques for some other practical problems in the literature. Fuzzy analytical networks are used in brand image management [8]. Another approach based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is developed for the ambiguous fault evaluations of lithography process [9]. A neural-network (NN) based approach is developed for the purpose of stabilization and stability analysis of nonlinear systems [10]. Another model based on fuzzy systems is developed to efficiently control nonlinear multivariable systems [11,12]. A decoupled adaptive neural network controller is developed in another study to stabilize and control the nonlinear system [13]. Another study proposes a probabilistic model based on historical events to be used to assess flood risk in Taiwan [14]. The Kalman filter model is used to determine the occurrence of debris flows [15]. Two studies about forecasting fresh food sales are based on the usage of logistic regression, moving average and BPNN methods [16,17]. Some data mining techniques are used to calculate the credit risk [18].This study aims to model the churn behavior of the GSM subscribers by using the Euclidean Indexing HDMR method which is used for the first time to model a multivariate classification problem. This method is a divide-and-conquer method and is based on HDMR philosophy which was first proposed by I.M. Sobol [19]. The main philosophy of HDMR algorithms is to model a multivariate problem in terms of less variate problems by applying a data partitioning procedure to the given training data set and to produce a polynomial based rule for the prediction of the class value of the testing node under consideration. Partitioning the given multivariate data set into less variate data sets such as univariate or bivariate data sets and dealing with these data sets instead of a single multivariate data set make the modeling process easy to apply to the multivariate classification problems. The Indexing HDMR philosophy with these capabilities of HDMR can be used for multivariate data partitioning to construct an analytical model for the given interpolation problem [20] and for multivariate classification problems [21].In this study, a polynomial structure as the model of the problem will be obtained through Euclidean Indexing HDMR by using the churn behavior information with the call details of the GSM subscribers and this model will be used to predict the churn behavior of a GSM subscriber under consideration. The Indexing HDMR philosophy has three important steps in its algorithm and these steps, each of which is a subalgorithm for the method, have an important effect on the performance of the method. These subalgorithms are sorting training nodes, applying a similarity metric between the considered testing node and the training nodes and determining the most appropriate index node for the considered testing node. Euclidean Indexing HDMR method has completely different algorithms compared with the methods of the previous works [20,21] and this results in a novel method working successfully in predicting the GSM churners.Generalized HDMR method is an alternative method for multivariate data partitioning to obtain an analytical model [22]. However, the algorithm of that method needs to solve a system of linear equations which is strongly dependent on the structure of the given data. This means that sometimes no solutions appear for the given problem under consideration and this case is also true for the GSM churners detection problem. That is, one cannot obtain a model through Generalized HDMR to predict the churn behavior of a subscriber.The HDMR philosophy is also used in various research areas and many variations of HDMR were developed either for improving the quality of the method itself or for solving different scientific problems. There are some works about applying HDMR to different topics such as small scale geometries [23], multivariate analysis [24], rational approximation [25], weight optimization [26], random sampling of the input variables [27,28], complex bionetwork structures [29], probabilistic analysis [30], reliability [31] and sensitivity analysis [32,33], piece-wise function approximation [34], decision making [35], finite element modeling [36] and HDMR component formulation with independent and correlated variables [37].This study covers the way of how Euclidean Indexing HDMR method models the GSM churners detection problem and the results of success levels of both the proposed method given here and some other data mining techniques in modeling the problem under consideration.Call detail records (CDR) and demographic data are collected to model the GSM churners. Data has 15000 subscriber CDR from a Turkish GSM company. This data set has 21 attributes with an output that indicates the churn behavior of each subscriber. The names and the descriptions of these attributes are given in Table 1. This data set is an up-to-date information for churn management and has completely different subscribers when compared with the subscribers of the previous approach [1].The attributes are composed of both demographic information and call details of the subscribers. Since the number of attributes and the number of subscribers are huge, to reduce the computational complexity, some of the attributes should be filtered to obtain the most weighted attributes for the churn detection process. For this purpose, Information Gain ranking filter is performed in WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) [38]. The rank results of the first 5 attributes, which are selected to model the given GSM churners detection problem, are given in Table 2. These attributes are AvgLenCall2Month, AvgLenCall4–6Month, AvgLenCallMonth, Sublen and Expense. The modeling process will be executed through the attributes related to the average length of calls in last 2 months, 4−−6 months and a single month while the registration duration of the subscriber and the monthly expense of the subscriber are also included. The monthly expense information consists of all outgoing calls of each subscriber.Table 3gives a number of node examples that the data set about the GSM subscribers have. These nodes are obtained through the normalization of the attribute values. Hence, the domain of each attribute is now unit interval, [0, 1]. The churn behavior is given as 0 or 1 where 0 value represents the subscriber has no churn behavior while the value 1 indicates that the subscriber has a churn behavior.In addition, when 5 parameters over 21 are selected for the modeling process, the number of unique rows in the data set that represents all subscribers becomes 956. The 67% of these nodes, which is 640, are randomly selected as training nodes while 316 nodes are for the testing part.
