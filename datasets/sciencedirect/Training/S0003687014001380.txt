Interaction between physical and psychosocial work risk factors for low back symptoms and its consequences amongst Indonesian coal mining workers

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Interaction between physical and psychosocial exposures was present and significant for reduced activities due to LBS.Interactions between physical and psychosocial exposures were also present and for LBS and absenteeism, but not significant.Workers with physical and psychosocial exposures were most likely to report LBS and its consequences.High psychosocial exposure appears to play a role in reporting LBS and particularly of its consequences.Current smokers increased the odds of reduced activities and absenteeism due to LBS.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study assessed the interaction between physical and psychosocial factors for low back symptoms (LBS) and its consequences (reduced activities and absenteeism) in a developing country. A sample of 1294 Indonesian coal mining workers reported occupational exposures, LBS and its consequences using a self-administered questionnaire. Respondents were placed into one of four combination exposure groups: high physical and high psychosocial (HPhyHPsy); high physical and low psychosocial (HPhyLPsy); low physical and high psychosocial (LPhyHPsy), and; low physical and low psychosocial (LPhyLPsy). The attributable proportion due to interaction between physical and psychosocial factors was examined. Individuals in the HPhyHPsy group were most likely to report LBS (OR 5.42, 95% CI 3.30–8.89), reduced activities (OR 4.89, 95% CI 3.09–7.74), and absenteeism (OR 4.96, 95% CI 3.05–8.06). Interactions between physical and psychosocial factors were present for LBS, reduced activities, and absenteeism; although for LBS and absenteeism the interactions were not significant. Current smokers were more likely to report LBS consequences. Permanent employment and night shift work increased the odds of LBS and its consequences. We conclude that interventions aimed at reducing LBS and its consequences should address both physical and psychosocial factors, with a focus on smokers, permanent employment and night shift work.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Low back symptom (LBS) is an important health problem due to their serious worldwide economic and social impacts (National Research Council and Institute of Medicine (NRC & IOM), 2001). In a review using data collected between 1969 and 1998, the 12-month period prevalence of LBS from eight developed countries ranged between 22% and 65% (Walker, 2000). For the consequences of LBS, i.e. reduced activities and absenteeism, it ranges from 18% to 42% (Scuffham et al., 2010; Widanarko et al., 2012b) and from 9% to 14% (Ijzelenberg et al., 2004; Scuffham et al., 2010; Widanarko et al., 2012b), respectively. Since industrially developing countries (IDCs) may have a high proportion of workers engaged in heavy manual work, it might be expected that the prevalence of LBS and its consequences would be greater than for developed countries (Volinn, 1997). However, the prevalence of LBS in IDCs (32–75%) (Chen et al., 2005; Louw et al., 2007; Widanarko et al., 2013) and absenteeism (13%) (Widanarko et al., 2013) are similar to that in developed countries. The prevalence of reduced activities (10–16%) (Chen et al., 2005; Widanarko et al., 2013) in IDCs is lower than for developed countries, but it is hard to be confident that this difference is real because relatively few studies of LBS have been undertaken in IDCs (Volinn, 1997). In worldwide terms, the paucity of information about the magnitude of LBS and its consequences among IDCs is a concern, since more than 80% of the global workforce live and work in the industrially developing world (United Nations et al., 2011). Hence, any study that investigates the burden of LBS in an IDC is important as it will, at the very least, provide baseline data for future comparison.Risk factors for LBS and its consequences involve physical and psychosocial factors. Physical risk factors for LBS that have been identified in various occupational groups include awkward back posture (Hooftman et al., 2009; Ijzelenberg et al., 2004; Lotters et al., 2003), lifting (Aasa et al., 2005; Elders and Burdorf, 2001; Hooftman et al., 2009; Lotters et al., 2003) and whole body vibration (Linton, 1990; Lotters et al., 2003). Risk factors for reduced activity include awkward posture (Aasa et al., 2005) and lifting (Aasa et al., 2005; Widanarko et al., 2012b). For absenteeism, they include awkward posture (Hoogendoorn et al., 2002; Widanarko et al., 2012b), lifting (Hooftman et al., 2009; Hoogendoorn et al., 2002) and whole body vibration (Hartman et al., 2005).Psychosocial risk factors associated with LBS include high job strain (Ijzelenberg et al., 2004), high psychological demands (Aasa et al., 2005; Elders and Burdorf, 2001; Hooftman et al., 2009; Ijzelenberg et al., 2004), low decision latitude (Aasa et al., 2005; Ijzelenberg et al., 2004), low social support (Aasa et al., 2005; Hooftman et al., 2009), job dissatisfaction (Hooftman et al., 2009), high effort–reward imbalance (ERI) score (Rugulies and Krause, 2008) and high work stress (Widanarko et al., 2012a). Risk factors for reduced activities have been reported as high psychological demand (Aasa et al., 2005), low decision latitude (Aasa et al., 2005), low social support (Aasa et al., 2005) and high ERI score (Simon et al., 2008), whilst those for absenteeism include low job control (Hemingway et al., 1997), low social support (Hooftman et al., 2009; van den Heuvel et al., 2004) and job dissatisfaction (Hooftman et al., 2009; Hoogendoorn et al., 2002; van den Heuvel et al., 2004).The relative role of physical and psychosocial factors in the aetiology of LBS and its consequences is complex. Davis and Heaney (2000) and Karsh (2006) proposed a model of the relationship between physical and psychosocial factors and LBS. These models suggest that both physical and psychosocial factors may independently influence LBS. The physical and psychosocial factors may also interact, giving rise to a probability of LBS being greater than the sum of the magnitude of the individual effects. Knol and VanderWeele (2012) recommend using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion (AP) and synergy index (S) to assess interaction for additive and multiplicative models. In the additive model, which is considered by Rothman (2012) to better reflect biologic interaction than the multiplicative model, RERI quantifies the extent to which the effect of the two factors together exceeds the effect of each considered individually. In contrast, AP, which has been used in many prior studies (e.g. Devereux et al., 2004, 1999, 2002; Lapointe et al., 2009; Tornqvist et al., 2001; Wahlstrom et al., 2004) measures the proportion of the joint effect of both exposures together that is due to the interaction (i.e. RERI divided by the relative risk of doubly exposed group). Although the synergy index (i.e. the ratio between combined effect and the sum of the individual effects) can also be used to assess interaction, it, however, is difficult to interpret if one or both of the exposures is preventive (Knol et al., 2011). For these reasons, the present study uses AP in an additive model to quantify the interaction.To the best of our knowledge only eight studies have investigated the interaction between physical and psychosocial risk factors and LBS and its consequences (Devereux et al., 2004, 1999; Fernandes et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2003; Lapointe et al., 2009; Linton, 1990; Vandergrift et al., 2012; Waters et al., 2011). They have all shown that individuals exposed to both high physical and high psychosocial factors have the highest risk of LBS. Most of the studies that examined this interaction, as cited above, were conducted in developed countries and only one study (Fernandes et al., 2009) has examined this interaction in an IDC (Brazil).With this background, the objective of the present study was to examine the interaction between physical and psychosocial exposures for LBS and its consequences (reduced activities and absenteeism). Since only one study has examined the interaction in an IDC, the present study was conducted in a coal mining company in Indonesia.
