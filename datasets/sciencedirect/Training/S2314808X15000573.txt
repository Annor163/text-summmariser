@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a new kind of sets called Dα-open sets are introduced and studied in a topological spaces. The class of all Dα-open sets is strictly between the class of all α-open sets and g-open sets. Also, as applications we introduce and study Dα-continuous, Dα-open, and Dα-closed functions between topological spaces. Finally, some properties of Dα-closed and strongly Dα-closed graphs are investigated.Generalized open sets play a very important role in General Topology, and they are now the research topics of many topologies worldwide. Indeed a significant theme in General Topology and Real Analysis is the study of variously modified forms of continuity, separation axioms, etc. by utilizing generalized open sets. One of the most well-known notions and also inspiration source are the notion of α-open [1] sets introduced by Njåstad in 1965 and generalized closed (g-closed) subset of a topological space [2] introduced by Levine in 1970. Since then, many mathematicians turned their attention to the generalization of various concepts in General Topology by considering α-open sets [3–10] and generalized closed sets [11–13]. In 1982 Dunham [14] used the generalized closed sets to define a new closure operator, and thus a new topology τ*, on the space, and examined some of the properties of this new topology. Throughout the present paper(X,τ),(Y,σ)and (Z, ν) denote topological spaces (briefly X, Y and Z) and no separation axioms are assumed on the spaces unless explicitly stated. For a subset A of a space (X, τ), Cl(A) and Int(A) denote the closure and the interior of A, respectively. Since we require the following known definitions, notations, and some properties, we recall in this section.Definition 1.1Let (X, τ) be a topological space and A ⊆ X. Then(i)A is α-open [1] ifA⊆Int(Cl(Int(A))and α-closed [1] ifCl(Int(Cl(A))⊆A.A is generalized closed (briefly g-closed) [2] if Cl(A) ⊆ U whenever A ⊆ U and U is open in X.A is generalized open(briefly g-open) [2] if X\A is g-closed.The α-closure of a subset A of X[3] is the intersection of all α-closed sets containing A and is denoted by Clα(A). The α-interior of a subset A of X[3] is the union of all α-open sets contained in A and is denoted by Intα(A). The intersection of all g-closed sets containing A[14] is called the g-closure of A and denoted by Cl*(A), and the g-interior of A[15] is the union of all g-open sets contained in A and is denoted by Int*(A).We need the following notations:•αO(X) (resp. αC(X)) denotes the family of all α-open sets (resp. α-closed sets) in (X, τ).GO(X) (resp. GC(X)) denotes the family of all generalized open sets (resp. generalized closed sets) in (X, τ).αO(X,x)={U|x∈U∈αO(X,τ)},O(X,x)={U|x∈U∈τ}andαC(X,x)={U|x∈U∈αC(X,τ)}.A function f : X → Y is said to be:(i)α-continuous [16] (resp. g-continuous [17]) if the inverse image of each open set in Y is α-open (resp. g-open) in X.α-open [16] (resp. α-closed [16]) if the image of each open (resp. closed ) set in X is α-open (resp. α-closed) in Y.g-open [18] (resp. g-closed [18]) if the image of each open (resp. closed) set in X is g-open (resp. g-closed) in Y.Let f : X → Y be a function:(i)The subset{(x,f(x))|x∈X}of the product space X × Y is called the graph of f[19] and is usually denoted by G(f).a closed graph [19] if its graph G(f) is closed sets in the product space X × Y.a strongly closed graph [20] if for each point(x,y)∉G(f), there exist open sets U ⊂ X and V ⊂ Y containing x and y, respectively, such that(U×Cl(V))∩G(f)=ϕ.a strongly α-closed graph [21] if for each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existU∈αO(X,x)and V ∈ O(Y, y) such that(U×Cl(V))∩G(f)=ϕ.A topological space (X, τ) is said to be:(i)α-T1[9] (resp. g-T1[22]) if for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist α-open (resp. g-open) set U in X containing x but not y and an α-open (resp. g-open) set V in X containing y but not x.α-T2[8] (resp. g-T2[22]) if for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist α-open (resp. g-open) sets U and V in X containing x and y, respectively, such that U ∩ V = ϕ.Let A ⊆ X, then(i)X\Cl*(A)=Int*(X\A).X\Int*(A)=Cl*(X\A).A functionf:(X,τ)→(Y,σ)has a closed graph [19] if for each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there exist U ∈ O(X, x) and V ∈ O(Y, y) such that f(U) ∩ V = ϕ.The graph G(f) is strongly closed [23] if and only if for each point(x,y)∉G(f), there exist open sets U ⊂ X and V ⊂ Y containing x and y, respectively, such thatf(U)∩Cl(V)=ϕ.In this section we introduce Dα-closed sets and investigate some of their basic properties.Definition 2.1A subset A of a space X is called Dα-closed ifCl*(Int(Cl*(A)))⊆A.The collection of all Dα-closed sets in X is denoted by DαC(X).Lemma 2.2If there exists an g-closed set F such thatCl*(Int(F))⊆A⊆F, then A is Dα-closed.Since F is g-closed, Cl*(F)  = F. Therefore,Cl*(Int(Cl*(A)))⊆Cl*(Int(Cl*(F)))=Cl*(Int(F))⊆A. Hence A is Dα-closed.The converse of above lemma is not true as shown in the following example.Let (X, τ) be a topological space, where X = {a, b, c} andτ={ϕ,{a},{a,b},X}. ThenFX={ϕ,{c},{b,c},X},GC(X)={ϕ,{c},{a,c},{b,c},X},GO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},X},DαC(X)={ϕ,{b},{c},{a,c},{b,c},X},DαO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},{a,c},X}. Therefore{c}∈DαC(X)and{a,c}∈GC(X)butCl*(Int{a,c})={a,c}⊄{c}⊂{a,c}.Let (X, τ) be a topological space. Then(i)Every α-closed subset of (X, τ) is Dα-closed.Every g-closed subset of (X, τ) is Dα-closed.(i) Since closed set is g-closed,Cl*(A)⊆Cl(A)[14]. Now, suppose A is α-closed in X, thenCl(Int(Cl(A)))⊆A. Therefore,Cl*(Int(Cl*(A)))⊆Cl(Int(Cl(A)))⊆A. Hence A is Dα-closed in X.(ii) Suppose A is g-closed. Then Cl*(A) = A[14]. Therefore,Int(Cl*(A))⊆Cl*(A). ThenCl*(Int(Cl*(A)))⊆Cl*(Cl*(A))⊆Cl*(A)=A[14]. Hence A is Dα-closed.The converse of above theorem is not true as shown in the following example.(i)Dα-closed set need not be α-closed.(see Example 2.7 below)Dα-closed set need not be g-closed.(see Example 2.7 below)Let (X, τ) be a topological space, whereX={a,b,c}andτ={ϕ,{a,b},X}. ThenFX=αC(X)={ϕ,{c},X},αO(X)={ϕ,{a,b},X},GC(X)={ϕ,{c},{a,c},{b,c},X},GO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},X},DαC(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{c},{a,c},{b,c},X},DαO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},X}. Therefore{a}∈DαC(X), but{a}∉αC(X)and{a}∉GC(X).From the above discussions we have the following diagram in which the converses of implications need not be true.α-closed set→Dα-closed set←g-closed setTheorem 2.8Arbitrary intersection of Dα-closed sets is Dα-closed.Let {Fi: i ∈ Λ} be a collection of Dα-closed sets in X. ThenCl*(Int(Cl*(Fi)))⊆Fifor each i. Since ∩ Fi⊆ Fifor each i,Cl*(∩Fi)⊆Cl*(Fi)for each i. HenceCl*(∩Fi)⊆∩Cl*(Fi),i∈Λ. ThereforeCl*(Int(Cl*(∩Fi)))⊆Cl*(Int(∩Cl*(Fi)))⊆Cl*(∩Int(Cl*(Fi)))⊆∩Cl*(Int(Cl*(Fi)))⊆∩Fi. Hence ∩Fiis Dα-closed.The union of two Dα-closed sets need not to be Dα-closed as shown in Example 2.7, where both {a} and {b} are Dα-closed sets but{a}∪{b}={a,b}is not Dα-closed.If a subset A is Dα-closed and B is α-closed, then A ∩ B is Dα-closed.Follows from Theorem 2.5 (i) and Theorem 2.8.If a subset A is Dα-closed and F is g-closed, then A ∩ F is Dα-closed.Follows from Theorem 2.5 (ii) and Theorem 2.8.Let A be a subset of a space X. The Dα-closure of A, denoted byClαD(A), is the intersection of all Dα-closed sets in X containing A. That isClαD(A)=∩{F:A⊆FandF∈DαC(X)}.Let A be a subset of X. Then A is Dα-closed set in X if and only ifClαD(A)=A.Suppose A is Dα-closed set in X. By Definition 2.12,ClαD(A)=A. Conversely, supposeClαD(A)=A. By Theorem 2.8A is Dα-closed.Let A and B be subsets of X. Then the following results hold.(i)A⊆ClαD(A)⊆Clα(A),ClαD(A)⊆Cl*(A).ClαD(ϕ)=ϕandClαD(X)=X.If A ⊆ B, ThenClαD(A)⊆ClαD(B).ClαD(ClαD(A))=ClαD(A).ClαD(A)∪ClαD(B)⊆ClαD(A∪B).ClαD(A∩B)⊆ClαD(A)∩ClαD(B).(i) Follows From Theorem 2.5 (i) and (ii), respectively.(ii) and (iii) are obvious.(iv) If A ⊆ F, F ∈ DαC(X), then from (iii) and Theorem 2.13,ClαD(A)⊆ClαD(F)=F. AgainClαD(ClαD(A))⊆ClαD(F)=F. ThereforeClαD(ClαD(A))⊆∩{F:A⊆F,F∈DαC(X)}=ClαD(A).(v) and (vi) follows from (iii).The equality in the statements (v) of the above theorem need not be true as seen from Example 2.7, where A = {a}, B = {b}, andA∪B={a,b}. Then one can have that,ClαD(A)={a};ClαD(B)={b};ClαD(A∪B)=X;ClαD(A)∪ClαD(B)={a,b}. Further more the equality in the statements (iv) of the above theorem need not be true as shown in the following example.Let (X, τ) be a topological space, where X = {a, b, c} andτ={ϕ,{b},{c},{b,c},X}. ThenFX=GC(X)=DαC(X)={ϕ,{a},{a,b},{a,c},X},GO(X)={ϕ,{b},{c},{b,c},X}. Let A = {a}, B = {b}, and A ∩ B = ϕ. Then one can have that,ClαD(A)={a};ClαD(B)={a,b};ClαD(A∩B)=ϕ;ClαD(A)∩ClαD(B)={a}.In this section we introduce Dα-open sets and investigate some of their basic properties.Definition 3.1A subset A of a space X is called an Dα-open if X \ A is Dα-closed. Let DαO(X) denote the collection of all an Dα-open sets in X.Let A ⊆ X, then(i)X\Cl*(X\A)=Int*(A).X\Int*(X\A)=Cl*(A).Obvious.A subset A of a space X is Dα-open if and only ifA⊆Int*(Cl(Int*(A))).Let A be Dα-open set. Then X \ A is Dα-closed andCl*(Int(Cl*(X\A)))⊆X\A. By Lemma 3.2A⊆Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). Conversely, supposeA⊆Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). ThenX\Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))⊆X\A. Hence(Int*(Cl(Int*(X\A))))⊆X\A. This shows that X \ A is Dα-closed. Thus A is Dα-open.If there exists g-open set V such thatV⊆A⊆Int*(Cl(V)), then A is Dα-open.Since V is g-open, X \ V is g-closed andX\Int*(Cl(V))⊆X\A⊆X\V. Therefore From Lemma 3.2Cl*(Int(X\V))⊆X\A⊆X\V. From Lemma 2.2 we have X \ A is Dα-closed. Hence A is Dα-open.The converse of Lemma 3.4 need not to be true as seen from Example 2.4, where{a,b}∈DαO(X)and{b}∈GO(X)but{b}⊂{a,b}⊄{b}.Let (X, τ) be a topological space. Then(i)Every α-open subset of (X, τ) is Dα-open.Every g-open subset of (X, τ) is Dα-open.From Theorem 2.5, the proof is obvious.The converse of the above theorem is not true as seen from Example 2.7, where{b,c}∈DαO(X)but{b,c}∉αO(X)and{b,c}∉GO(X).From the above discussions we have the following diagram in which the converses of implications need not be true.α-open set→Dα-open set←g-open setTheorem 3.8Arbitrary union of Dα-open set is Dα-open.Follows from Theorem 2.8.The intersection of two Dα-open sets need not be Dα-open as seen from Example 2.7, where both {b, c} and {a, c} are Dα-open sets but{b,c}∩{a,c}={c}is not Dα-open.If a subset A is Dα-open and B is α-open, then A ∪ B is Dα-open.Follows from Theorem 3.6 (i) and Theorem 3.8.If a subset A is Dα-open and U is g-open, then A ∪ U is Dα-open.Follows from Theorem 3.6 (ii) and Theorem 3.8.Let A be a subset of a space X. The Dα-interior of A is denoted byIntαD(A), is the union of all an Dα-open sets in X contained in A. That isIntαD(A)=∪{U:U⊆A,U∈DαO(X)}.If A is a subset of X, then(i)X\ClαD(A)=IntαD(X\A).X\IntαD(A)=ClαD(X\A).Obvious.Let A be a subset of X. Then A is Dα-open if and only ifIntαD(A)=A.Follows from Theorem 2.13 and Lemma 3.13.Let A and B be subsets of X. Then the following results hold.(i)Intα(A)⊆IntαD(A)⊆A,Int*(A)⊆IntαD(A).IntαD(ϕ)=ϕandIntαD(X)=X.If A ⊆ B, thenIntαD(A)⊆IntαD(B).IntαD(IntαD(A))=IntαD(A).IntαD(A)∪IntαD(B)⊆IntαD(A∪B).IntαD(A∩B)⊆IntαD(A)∩IntαD(B).Obvious.The equality in the statements (v) of Theorem 3.15 need not be true as seen from Example 2.7, where A = {b, c}, B = {a, c}, and A ∪ B = X. Then one can have that,IntαD(A)={b,c};IntαD(B)={c};IntαD(A)∪IntαD(B)={b,c};IntαD(A∪B)=X. Furthermore the equality in the statements (iv) of the above theorem need not be true as seen from Example 2.7, where A = {b, c}, B = {a, c}, and A ∩ B = {c}. Then one can have that,IntαD(A)={b,c};IntαD(B)={a,c};IntαD(A∩B)=ϕ;IntαD(A)∩IntαD(B)={c}.Let x ∈ X. Thenx∈ClαD(A)if and only if U ∩ A ≠ ϕ for every Dα-open set U containing x.Letx∈ClαD(A)and there exists Dα-open set U containing x such that U ∩ A = ϕ. ThenA⊆X\Uand X\U is Dα-closed. ThereforeClαD(A)⊆ClαD(X\U)=X\U. This impliesx∉ClαD(A), which is a contradiction. Conversely, assume that U ∩ A ≠ ϕ for every Dα-open set U containing x andx∉ClαD(A). Then there exists Dα-closed subset F containing A such thatx∉F. Hence x ∈ X \ F and X \ F is Dα-open. Therefore A ⊆ F,(X\F)∩A=ϕThis is a contradiction to our assumption.Let A be any subset of (X, τ). Then(i)A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))is Dα-open;A∪Cl*(Int(Cl*(A)))is Dα-closed.(i)Int*(Cl(Int*(A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A))))))=Int*(Cl(Int*(A)∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))))=Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). This implies thatA∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))=A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A))))))⊆Int*(Cl(Int*(A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))))). ThereforeA∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))is Dα-open.From (i) we haveX\(A∪Cl*(Int(Cl*(A)))=(X\A)∩Int*(Cl(Int*(X\A)))is Dα-open that further impliesA∪Cl*(Int(Cl*(A)))is Dα-closed.If A is a subset of a topological space X,(i)IntαD(A)=A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A))).ClαD(A)=A∪Cl*(Int(Cl*(A))).(i)LetB=IntαD(A). Clearly B is Dα-open and B ⊆ A. Since B is Dα-open,B⊆Int*(Cl(Int*(B)))⊆Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). This proves thatB⊆A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). By Lemma 3.18,A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))is Dα-open. By the definition ofIntαD(A),A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A)))⊆B. Then it follows thatB=A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A))). ThereforeIntαD(A)=A∩Int*(Cl(Int*(A))).By Lemma 3.13 we haveClαD(A)=X\IntαD(X\A),=X\((X\A)∩Int*(Cl(Int*(X\A)))), using (i)=X\(X\A)∪(X\Int*(Cl(Int*(X\A)))=A∪Cl*(Int(Cl*(A))).In this section we introduce Dα-continuous functions and investigate some of their basic properties.Definition 4.1A function f : X → Y is called Dα-continuous if the inverse image of each open set in Y is Dα-open in X.(i)Every α-continuous function is Dα-continuous.Every g-continuous function is Dα-continuous.It is obvious from Theorem 3.6.(i)Dα-continuous function need not be α-continuous.(see Example 4.4 (i) below)Dα-continuous function need not be g-continuous.(see Example 4.4 (ii) below)(i) Let X = {a, b, c} associated with the topologyτ={ϕ,{a},X}and Y = {x, y, z} associated with the topologyσ={ϕ,{x,y},{z},Y}. Let f : X → Y be a function defined by f(a) = f(b) = x, f(c) = z. One can have thatFX={ϕ,{b,c},X},GC(X)={ϕ,{b},{c},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},X},GO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{c},{a,b},{a,c},X},αO(X)={ϕ,{a},{a,b},{a,c},X}, DαC(X) = DαO(X) =P(X). Since {z} is open in Y,f−1({z})={c}∈DαO(X), but{c}∉αO(X). Therefore f is Dα-continuous but not α-continuous.(ii) Let (X,τ) and (Y,σ) be the topological spaces in (i) and f : X → Y be a function defined by f(a) = x, f(b) = f(c) = z. Since {z} is open in Y,f−1({z})={b,c}∈DαO(X), but{b,c}∉GO(X). Therefore f is Dα-continuous but not g-continuous.From the above discussions we have the following diagram in which the converses of implications need not be true.α-continuity→Dα-continuity←g-continuityTheorem 4.5Let f : X → Y be a function. Then the following are equivalent:(i)f is Dα-continuous.For each x ∈ X and each open set V ⊂ Y containing f(x), there exists Dα-open set W ⊂ X containing x such that f(W) ⊂ V.The inverse image of each closed set in Y is Dα-closed in X.f(ClαD(A))⊆Cl(f(A))for every subset A of X.ClαD(f−1(B))⊆f−1(Cl(B))for every subset B of Y.f−1(Int(B))⊆IntαD(f−1(B))for every subset B of Y.(i)⇒(ii) Since V ⊂ Y containing f(x) is open, thenf−1(V)∈DαO(X). SetW=f−1(V)which contains x, therefore f(W) ⊂ V.(ii)⇒(i) Let V ⊂ Y be open, and letx∈f−1(V), then f(x) ∈ V and thus there existsWx∈DαO(X)such that x ∈ Wxand f(Wx) ⊂ V. Thenx∈Wx⊂f−1(V), and sof−1(V)=∪x∈f−1(V)Wxbut∪x∈f−1(V)Wx∈DαO(X)by Theorem 3.8. Hencef−1(V)∈DαO(X), and therefore f is Dα-continuous.(i)⇒(iii) Let F ⊂ Y be closed. Then Y\F is open andf−1(Y\F)∈DαO(X), i.e.X−f−1(F)∈DαO(X). Thenf−1(F)is Dα-closed of X.(iii)⇒(iv) LetA⊆Xand F be a closed set in Y containing f(A). Then by (iii),f−1(F)is Dα-closed set containing A. It follows thatClαD(A)⊆ClαD(f−1(F))=f−1(F)and hencef(ClαD(A))⊆F. Thereforef(ClαD(A))⊆Cl(f(A)).(iv)⇒(v) LetB⊆YandA=f−1(B). Then by assumption,f(ClαD(A))⊆Cl(f(A))⊆Cl(B). This implies thatClαD(A)⊆f−1(Cl(B)). HenceClαD(f−1(B))⊆f−1(Cl(B)).(v)⇒(vi) LetB⊆Y. By assumption,ClαD(f−1(Y\B))⊆f−1(Cl(Y\B)). This implies that,ClαD(X\f−1(B))⊆f−1(Y\Int(B))and henceX\IntαD(f−1(B))⊆X\f−1(Int(B)). By taking complement on both sides we getf−1(Int(B))⊆IntαD(f−1(B)).(vi)⇒(i) Let U be any open set in Y. Then Int(U) = U. By assumption,f−1(Int(U))⊆IntαD(f−1(U))and hencef−1(U)⊆IntαD(f−1(U)). Thenf−1(U)=IntαD(f−1(U)). Therefore by Theorem 3.14,f−1(U)is Dα-open in X. Thus f is Dα-continuous.Let f : X → Y be Dα-continuous and let g : Y → Z be continuous. Then gof : X → Z is Dα-continuous.Obvious.Composition of two Dα-continuous functions need not be Dα-continuous as seen from the following example.LetX={a,b,c}associated with the topologyτ={ϕ,{b},{a,b},X},Y={x,y,z}associated with the topologyσ={ϕ,{x},Y}andZ={p,q,r}associated with the topologyν={ϕ,{r},Z}andf:(X,τ)→(Y,σ)by f(a) = y, f(b) = x, f(c) = z. Defineg:(Y,σ)→(Z,ν)byg(x)=g(y)=p, g(z) = r. One can have thatFX={ϕ,{c},{a,c},X},GC(X)={ϕ,{c},{a,c},{b,c},X},GO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},X},DαC(X)={ϕ,{a},{c},{a,c},{b,c},X},DαO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},{b,c},X}, andFY={ϕ,{y,z},Y},GC(Y)={ϕ,{y},{z},{x,y},{x,z},{y,z},Y},GO(Y)={ϕ,{x},{y},{z},{x,y},{x,z},Y},DαC(Y)=DαO(Y)=P(X). Clearly, f and g are Dα-continuous. {r} is open in Z. But(gof)−1({r})=f−1(g−1({r}))=f−1({z})={c}, which is not Dα-open in X. Therefore gof is not Dα-continuous.In this section we introduce Dα-open functions and Dα-closed functions and investigate some of their basic properties.Definition 5.1A function f : X → Y is said to be Dα-open (resp. Dα-closed) if the image of each open (resp. closed) set in X is Dα-open (resp. Dα-closed) in Y.(i)Every α-open function is Dα-open.Every g-open function is Dα-open.It is obvious from Theorem 3.6.(i)Dα-open function need not be α-open.(see Example 5.4 below)Dα-open function set need not be g-open.(see Example 5.5 below)(i) Let X = {x,y,z} associated with the topologyτ={ϕ,{x},X}and Y = {a,b,c} associated with the topologyσ={ϕ,{a,b},{c},Y}. Letf:(X,τ)→(Y,σ)be a function defined by f(x) = a, f(y) = b and f(z) = c. One can have thatFY=αO(Y)={ϕ,{a,b},{c},Y}, GC(Y) = GO(Y) = DαC(Y) = DαO(Y) = P(X). Since {x} is open in X,f({x})={a}∈DαO(Y), but{a}∉αO(Y). Therefore f is Dα-open function but not α-open.(ii) Let X = {x,y,z} associated with the topologyτ={ϕ,{y},{x,y},X}and Y = {a, b, c} associated with the topologyσ={ϕ,{a},Y}. Letf:(X,τ)→(Y,σ)be a function defined by f(x)  = b, f(y)  = c and f(z)  = a. One can have thatFY={ϕ,{b,c},Y},GC(Y)={ϕ,{b},{c},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},Y},GO(Y)={ϕ,{a},{b},{c},{a,b},{a,c},Y},DαC(Y)=DαO(Y)=P(X). Since {x,y} is open in X,f({x,y})={b,c}∈DαO(Y), but{b,c}∉GO(Y). Therefore f is Dα-open function but not g-open.From the above discussions we have the following diagram in which the converses of implications need not be true.α-open function→Dα-open function←g-open functionTheorem 5.6Let f : X → Y be a function. The following statements are equivalent.(i)f is Dα-open.For each x ∈ X and each neighborhood U of x, there exists Dα-open set W ⊆ Y containing f(x) such that W ⊆ f(U).(i)⇒(ii) Let x ∈ X and U is a neighborhood of x, then there exists an open set V ⊆ X such that x ∈ V ⊆ U. Set W = f(V). Since f is Dα-open,f(V)=W∈DαO(Y)and sof(x)∈W⊆f(U).(ii)⇒(i) Obvious.Let f : X → Y be Dα-open (resp. Dα-closed) function and W ⊆ Y. If A ⊆ X is a closed (resp. open) set containingf−1(W), then there exists Dα-closed (resp. Dα-open) set H ⊆ Y containing W such thatf−1(H)⊆A.LetH=Y\f(X\A). Sincef−1(W)⊆A, we havef(X\A)⊆Y\W. Since f is Dα-open (resp. Dα-closed), then H is Dα-closed (resp. Dα-open) set andf−1(H)=X\f−1(f(X\A))⊂X\(X\A)=A.If f : X → Y is Dα-open, thenf−1(ClαD(B))⊆Cl(f−1(B))for each set B ⊂ Y.SinceCl(f−1(B))is closed in X containingf−1(B)for a set B ⊆ Y. By Theorem 5.7, there exists Dα-closed set H ⊆ Y, B ⊆ H such thatf−1(H)⊆Cl(f−1(B)). Thus,f−1(ClαD(B))⊆f−1(ClαD(H))⊆f−1(H)⊆Cl(f−1(B)).A function f : X → Y is Dα-open if and only iff(Int(A))⊆IntαD(f(A))for every subset A of X.Suppose f : X → Y is Dα-open function and A ⊆ X. Then Int(A) is open set in X andf(Int(A))is Dα-open set contained in f(A). Thereforef(Int(A))⊆IntαD(f(A)). Conversely, let bef(Int(A))⊆IntαD(f(A))for every subset A of X and U is open set in X. Then Int(U) = U,f(U)⊆IntαD(f(U)). Hencef(U)=IntαD(f(U)). By Theorem 3.14f(U) is Dα-open.For any bijective functionf:(X,τ)→(Y,σ)the following statements are equivalent.(i)f−1is Dα-continuous function.f is Dα-open function.f is Dα-closed function.(i)⇒(ii) Let U be an open set in X. Then X \ U is closed in X. Sincef−1is Dα-continuous,(f−1)−1(X\U)is Dα-closed in Y. That isf(X\U)=Y\f(U)is Dα-closed in Y. This implies f(U) is Dα-open in Y. Hence f is Dα-open function.(ii)⇒ (iii) Let F be a closed set in X. Then X \ F is open in X. Since f is Dα-open, f(X \ F) is Dα-open in Y. That isf(X\F)=Y\f(F)is Dα-open in Y. This implies f(F) is Dα-closed in Y. Hence f is Dα-closed function.(iii)⇒ (i) Let F be closed set in X. Since f is Dα-closed function, f(F) is Dα-closed in Y. That is(f−1)−1(F)is Dα-closed in Y. Hencef−1is Dα-continuous function.Composition of two Dα-open functions need not be Dα-open as seen from the following example.Let X = {x, y, z} associated with the topologyτ={ϕ,{x,y},{z},X}, Y = {p, q, r} associated with the topologyσ={ϕ,{p},Y}and Z = {a,b,c} associated with the topology,ν={ϕ,{b},{a,b},Z}. Definef:(X,τ)→(Y,σ)by f(x) = p, f(y) = q, f(z) = r andg:(Y,σ)→(Z,ν)by g(p) = b, g(q) = a, g(r) = c. One can have that;FY={ϕ,{q,r},Y},GC(Y)={ϕ,{q},{r},{p,q},{p,r},{q,r},Y},GO(Y)={ϕ,{p},{q},{r},{p,q},{p,r},Y},DαC(Y)=DαO(Y)=P(X)andFZ={ϕ,{c},{a,c},Z},GC(Z)={ϕ,{c},{a,c},{b,c},Z},GO(Z)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},Z},DαC(Z)={ϕ,{a},{c},{a,c},{b,c},Z},DαO(Z)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},{b,c},Z}. Clearly, f and g are Dα-open function. {z} is open in X. Butgof({z})=g(f({z}))=g({r})={c}which is not Dα-open in Z. Therefore gof is not Dα-open function.In this section we introduce Dα-closed graph and strongly Dα-closed and investigate some of their basic properties.Definition 6.1A function f : X → Y has Dα-closed graph if for each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈GO(Y,y)such that(U×Cl*(V))∩G(f)=ϕ.Evidently every closed graph is Dα-closed. That the converse is not true is seen from the following example.Let X = {a, b, c} associated with the topologyτ={ϕ,{a,b},X}and Y = {x, y, z} associated with the topologyσ={ϕ,{x},{x,y},Y}. Letf:(X,τ)→(Y,σ)be a function defined by f(a) = f(c) = x, f(b) = y. One can have thatFX={ϕ,{c},X},GC(X)={ϕ,{c},{a,c},{b,c},X},GO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},X},DαO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},X}andFY={ϕ,{z},{y,z},Y},GC(Y)={ϕ,{z},{x,z},{y,z},Y},GO(Y)={ϕ,{x},{y},{x,y},Y}. Since{a,c}∈DαO(X,c)and{y}∈GO(Y,y)but{a,c}∉O(X)and{y}∉O(Y). Therefore G(f) is Dα-closed but not closed.Letf:(X,τ)→(Y,σ)be a function and(i)f is Dα-closed graph;For each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈GO(Y,y)such thatf(U)∩Cl*(V)=ϕ.For each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈DαO(Y,y)such that(U×ClαD(V))∩G(f)=ϕ.For each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈DαO(Y,y)such thatf(U)∩ClαD(V)=ϕ. Then(1)(i)⇔ (ii)(i)⇒ (iii)(ii)⇒ (iv)(i)⇒ (iv)(i)⇒(ii) Suppose f is Dα-closed graph. Then for each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existsU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈GO(Y,y)such that(U×Cl*(V))∩G(f)=ϕ. This implies that for eachf(x)∈f(U)and y ∈ Cl*(V). Since y ≠ f(x),f(U)∩Cl*(V)=ϕ.(ii)⇒(i) Let(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f). Then there existsU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈GO(Y,y)such thatf(U)∩Cl=*(V)=ϕ. This implies that f(x) ≠ y for each x ∈ U and y ∈ Cl*(V). Therefore(U×Cl*(V))∩G(f)=ϕ.(i)⇒(iii) Suppose f is Dα-closed graph. Then for each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existsU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈GO(Y,y)such that(U×Cl*(V))∩G(f)=ϕ. Since g-open set is Dα-open,ClαD(V)⊆Cl*(V). Therefore(U×ClαD(V))∩G(f)=ϕ.(ii)⇒(iv) Let(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f). Then there existsU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈GO(Y,y)such thatf(U)∩Cl*(V)=ϕ. SinceClαD(V)⊆Cl*(V),f(U)∩ClαD(V)⊆f(U)∩Cl*(V)=ϕ.(i)⇒(iv) From (ii).A topological space (X,τ) is said to be Dα-T1 if for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist Dα-open U in X containing x but not y and an Dα-open V in X containing y but not x.(i)Every α-T1 space is Dα-T1.Every g-T1 space is Dα-T1.It is obvious from Theorem 3.6.The converse of the above theorem is not true as seen from Example 2.7.Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is g-T1.Lety1​,y2(y1≠y2)∈Y. The subjectivity of f gives the existence of an element xo∈ X such that f(xo) = y2. Now(xo​,y1)∈(X×Y)\G(f). The Dα-closeness of G(f) providesU1∈DαO(X,xo),V1∈GO(Y,y1)such thatf(U1)∩Cl*(V1)=ϕ. Nowxo∈U1⇒f(xo)=y2∈f(U1). This and the fact thatf(U1)∩Cl*(V1)=ϕguarantee thaty2∉V1. Again from the subjectivity of f gives a x1 ∈ X such that f(x1) = y1. Now(x1​,y2)∈(X×Y)\G(f)and the Dα-closedness of G(f) providesU2∈DαO(X,x1),V2∈GO(Y,y2)such thatf(U2)∩Cl*(V2)=ϕ. Nowx1∈U2⇒f(x1)=y1∈f(U2)so thaty1∉V2. Thus we obtain setsV1​,V2∈GO(Y)such that y1 ∈ V1 buty2∉V1while y2 ∈ V2 buty1∉V2. Hence Y is g-T1.Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is Dα-T1.Follows From Theorems 6.6 (i) and 6.8.Let f : X → Y be any injective with G(f) Dα-closed. Then X is Dα-T1.Letx1​,x2(x1≠x2)∈X. The injectivity of f impliesf(x1)≠f(x2)whence one obtains that(x1​,f(x2))∈(X×Y)\G(f). The Dα-closedness of G(f) providesU1∈DαO(X,x1),V1∈GO(Y,f(x2))such thatf(U1)∩Cl*(V1)=ϕ. Thereforef(x2)∉f(U1)and a fortiorix2∉U1. Again(x2​,f(x1))∈(X×Y)\G(f)and Dα-closedness of G(f) as before givesU2∈DαO(X,x2),V2∈GO(Y,f(x1))withf(U2)∩Cl*(V2)=ϕ, which guarantees thatf(x1)∉f(U2)and sox1∉U2. Therefore, we obtain sets U1 andU2∈DαO(X)such that x1 ∈ U1 butx2∉U1while x2 ∈ U2 butx1∉U2. Hence X is Dα-T1.Let f : X → Y be any bijection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then both X and Y are Dα-T1.It readily follows from Corollary 6.9 and Theorem 6.10.A topological space (X, τ) is said to be Dα-T2 if for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist Dα-open sets U and V in X containing x and y, respectively, such that U ∩ V = ϕ.(i)Every α-T2 space is Dα-T2.Every g-T2 space is Dα-T2.Obvious.The converse of the above theorem is not true as seen from Example 2.7.Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is g-T2.Lety1​,y2(y1≠y2)∈Y. The subjectivity of f gives a x1 ∈ X such that f(x1) = y1. Now(x1​,y2)∈(X×Y)\G(f). The Dα-closedness of G(f) providesU∈DαO(X,x1),V∈GO(Y,y2)such thatf(U)∩Cl*(V)=ϕ. Nowx1∈U⇒f(x1)=y1∈f(U). This and the fact thatf(U)∩Cl*(V)=ϕguarantee thaty1∉Cl*(V). This mean that there existsW∈GO(Y,y1)such that W ∩ V = ϕ. Hence Y is g-T2.Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is Dα-T2.Follows from Theorems 6.13 (ii) and 6.15.A function f : X → Y has a strongly Dα-closed graph if for each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existU∈DαO(X,x)and V ∈ O(Y, y) such that(U×Cl(V))∩G(f)=ϕ.A strongly Dα-closed graph is Dα-closed. That the converse is not true is seen from Example 6.3, where{y}∈GO(Y,y)but{y}∉O(Y). Therefore G(f) is Dα-closed but not strongly Dα-closed.Evidently every strongly α-closed graph (resp. strongly closed graph) is strongly Dα-closed graph. That the converse is not true is seen from the following example.Let X = {a, b, c} associated with the topologyτ={ϕ,{a,b},X}and Y = {x, y, z} associated with the topologyσ={ϕ,{x,y},{z},Y}. Letf:(X,τ)→(Y,σ)be a function defined by f(a) = f(c) = x, f(b) = y. One can have thatFX={ϕ,{c},X},GC(X)={ϕ,{c},{a,c},{b,c},X},GO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},X},αO(X)={ϕ,{a,b},X},DαO(X)={ϕ,{a},{b},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},X}. Since{a,c}∈DαO(X,c)and{z}∈O(Y,z)but{a,c}∉αO(X)(resp.{a,c}∉O(X)). Therefore G(f) is strongly Dα-closed but not strongly α-closed (resp. strongly closed).For a functionf:(X,τ)→(Y,σ), the following properties are equivalent:(i)f has strongly Dα-closed graph.For each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existU∈DαO(X,x)and V ∈ O(Y, y) such thatf(U)∩Cl(V)=ϕ.For each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈αO(Y,y)such that(U×Clα(V))∩G(f)=ϕ.For each(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f), there existU∈DαO(X,x)andV∈αO(Y,y)such thatf(U)∩Clα(V)=ϕ.Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.4.If f : X → Y is a function with a strongly Dα-closed graph, then for each x ∈ X,f(x)=∩{Clα(f(U)):U∈DαO(X,x)}.Suppose the theorem is false. Then there exists a y ≠ f(x) such thaty∈∩{Clα(f(U)):U∈DαO(X,x)}. This implies thaty∈Clα(f(U))for everyU∈DαO(X,x). So V ∩ f(U) ≠ ϕ for everyV∈αO(Y,y). This, in its turn, indicates thatClα(V)∩f(U)⊃V⊃f(U)≠ϕ, which contradicts the hypothesis that f is a function with Dα-closed graph. Hence the theorem holds.If f : X → Y is Dα-continuous function and Y is T2. Then G(f) is strongly Dα-closed.Let(x,y)∈(X×Y)\G(f). Since Y is T2, there exists a set V ∈ O(Y, y) such thatf(x)∉Cl(V). But Cl(V) is closed. NowY\Cl(V)∈O(Y,f(x)). By Theorem 4.5 there existsU∈DαO(X,x)such thatf(U)⊆Y\Cl(V). Consequently,f(U)∩Cl(V)=ϕand therefore G(f) is strongly Dα-closed.Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then Y is T1 and α-T1.Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.8 and T1-ness always guarantees α-T1-ness. Hence Y is α-T1.Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then Y is Dα-T1.Follows From Theorems 6.6 (i) and 6.24.Let f : X → Y be any injective with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then X is Dα-T1.Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.10.Let f : X → Y be any bijection with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then both X and Y are Dα-T1.It readily follows from Corollary 6.25 and Theorem 6.26.Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then Y is T2 and α-T2.Similar to the proof Theorem 6.15 and T2-ness always guarantees α-T2-ness. Hence Y is α-T2.Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then Y is Dα-T2.Follows From Theorems 6.13 (i) and 6.28.
