@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The avascular multiphase model for tumor growth, developed by the authors in previous works, is enhanced to include angiogenesis. The original model comprises the extracellular matrix (ECM) as porous solid phase and three fluid phases: living and necrotic tumor cells (TCs), host cells (HCs), and the interstitial fluid. In this paper we add transport of tumor angiogenic factor (TAF) and of endothelial cells. The density of the endothelial cells represents the newly created vessels in a smeared manner. Co-opted blood vessels can be added as line element with flow or can be taken into account as boundary condition. The model is hence of the continuum–discrete type. Two examples show the potential of the newly enhanced model. The first deals with growth of a 2D tumor spheroid in a square tissue domain. From a blood vessel, posed on one side of the domain, angiogenesis takes place through the migration of endothelial cells from the vessel to the tumor. The second one is the simulation of cutaneous melanoma growth with the diffusion of TAF from the living tumor cells and the consequent development of a new vessel network, represented by the endothelial cells density. The introduction of angiogenesis will allow for simulating the delivery of chemotherapeutic and nanoparticle-mediated agents to the vascular tumor, and for evaluation of the therapeutic effect.EquationEquationsThermodynamically Constrained Averaging TheoryCoefficient in the pressure–saturations relationshipNonlinear coefficient of the discretized capacity matrixRate of strain tensorEffective diffusion coefficient for the speciesidissolved in the phaselEndothelial cellsDiscretized source term associated to the primary variablevNonlinear coefficient of the discretized conduction matrixCompressibility of the phasei(i=s,t,handl)Intrinsic permeability tensor of the ECMRelative permeability of the phaseαVector of shape functions related to the primary variablevPressure in the phaseαPressure difference between fluid phasesiandjSaturation degree of the phaseαEffective stress tensor of the solid phasesTotal stress tensor of the solid phasesYield limit of the solid phase which defines the boundary of elastic domainTumor angiogenic factorsDisplacement vector of the solid phasesVelocity vector of the phaseαSolution vectorBiot’s coefficientGrowth coefficientNecrosis coefficientNutrient consumption coefficient related to growthNutrient consumption coefficient not related to growthPorosityVolume fraction of the phaseαViscosity parameter of the solid phaseDynamic viscosity of the phaseαDensity of the phaseαInterfacial tension between fluid phasesiandjAdhesion of the phaseαMass fraction of necrotic cells in the tumor cells phaseNutrient mass fraction in the interstitial fluidCritical nutrient mass fraction for growthReference nutrient mass fraction in the environmentTAF mass fraction in the interstitial fluidCritical TAF mass fractionEndothelial cells mass fraction in the interstitial fluidCritical endothelial cells mass fraction for the death of the endothelial cellsCoefficient for uptake of TAF by endothelial cellsDegradation rate coefficient for TAF demiseCoefficient for TAF and endothelial cells productionCoefficient for new oxygen brought by the new capillary networkInter-phase mass transferReaction term i.e. intra-phase mass transferCritical valueNutrientHost cell phaseInterstitial fluidSolidTumor cell phasePhase indicator withα=t,h,l, orsTAFEndothelial cellsOxygen

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Angiogensis is the formation of new vessels from the existing vasculature. It is of fundamental importance in many physiological processes such as normal tissue growth, embryonic development, wound healing, and pathological ones  [1]. When a malignant mass reaches a characteristic size of about 100 μm, corresponding to several thousands of tumor cells, new vessels are required to support its rapid growth. For larger sizes, the deep penetration of oxygen and other nutrients would be impaired leading to the formation of a necrotic core and the progressive regression of the malignant mass. Under conditions of hypoxia tumor cells secrete chemical stimuli, the tumor angiogenic factors (TAF), that diffuse into the surrounding tissue. The endothelial cells, lining vessels, are stimulated to migrate towards the tumor and form a new capillary network which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the tumor cells. As a consequence these can grow and multiply much faster  [2]. Further the cells of vascular tumors can escape through the newly created blood vessel network and invade other tissues and organs and seed secondary tumors (metastases). Angiogenesis is hence fundamental in the progression of the disease, to the point that several anticancer drugs are specifically designed to interfere with the biochemical stimuli regulating angiogenesis. Such angiogenic inhibitors may block the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway, and prune tumor vessels; while others such as flavonoids and microtubule binding molecules rapidly and selectively kill the tumor vasculature  [3]. A new approach on the other hand aims at vessel normalization to enhance the vascular function with the goal of improving delivery of chemotherapy and promoting a more oxygenized and immune-stimulating tumor environment  [3]. Therefore, accurate modeling of the vasculature compartment and its growth is crucial for predicting tumor development over time and response to therapeutic intervention.As shown in Lowengrub et al.  [4] mathematical models of tumor-induced angiogenesis started with the work of Balding and McElwain  [5]. With reference to continuum models of tumor growth angiogenesis has been introduced either through a pure continuum approach focusing on blood vessel density or by a continuum–discrete approach representing vessels as line segments, continuous curves, interconnected lattice patterns or collections of individual endothelial cells.Within the realm of the continuum approach, conservation laws are introduced to describe the dynamics of the vessel densities and angiogenic factors. These models do not provide usually morphological or blood flow information about the vasculature. More recent representative works are those of Breward et al.  [6], Hogea et al.  [7], Peterson et al.  [8], Addison Smith et al.  [9], Stamper et al.  [10] and Markert and Haeberle  [11]. Representative recent examples of the continuum–discrete approach are given by Zheng et al.  [12], Frieboes et al.  [13] and Bearer et al.  [14]; Lima et al.  [15] use a phase field approach to solve a hybrid ten-species model of tumor growth including angiogenesis. Milde et al.  [16] present a continuum–discrete approach to angiogenesis without a tumor growth model and Kojic et al.  [17] a continuum–discrete convective–diffusive transport model without angiogenesis and growth. A more extensive review and discussion of these models can be found in  [18–20].The continuum model presented in this work is an extension of the continuum avascular model of tumor growth [21,22], recently enhanced in  [23]. It is a multiphase flow model in a porous solid, the extracellular matrix (ECM); it comprises three fluid phases, tumor cells (TCs), which partition into living cells and necrotic cells, healthy cells (HCs) and interstitial fluid (IF). The IF transports chemical species such as nutrients, in our case oxygen. The new vascular model comprises these four phases and two new chemical species: the TAF and the endothelial cells that diffuse into the IF phase. Transport within extravascular space takes place by convection and diffusion; according to experimental in vitro and in vivo data  [13], tissue glycosaminoglycan content and drug molecular weight are important parameters which determine whether extravascular transport is governed by diffusion or convection  [17]. Differently from other models which are not coupled with IF, TAF and fibronectin are transported by the IF which permeates the whole region under consideration. Since there are much less endothelial cells than healthy and tumor cells the interaction between the two groups is neglected as far as the cell velocity is concerned (Zheng et al.  [12], Bussolino et al.  [24]). Existing vasculature can easily be introduced into the model by line elements with blood flow  [22].The paper is outlined as follows: after this introduction the growth model is briefly recalled in Section  2. The new vascular model is presented in Section  3; Section  4 deals with the implementation of the numerical solution of the governing equations and Section  5 shows two simulations of angiogenesis. The first is an example in 2D of a tumor release of TAF and the response of endothelial cells diffusing from the opposite side of the domain with respect to the tumor; the second one is the melanoma growth with diffusion of TAF and consequent migration of endothelial cells from an existing vessel towards the original tumor. The conclusions discuss possible future exploitation of angiogenic vessels for delivering chemotherapeutic agents and nanoparticle-mediated agents to the vascular tumor, and the possible control of their therapeutic effect.The avascular model for tumor growth reported in  [22,23] is here briefly summarized for sake of completeness. It is recalled that tumors are modeled at the macroscopic scale, being the domain of interest too large and the phase distributions too complex for modeling at the microscale. The TCAT approach  [25–27] is used to transform known microscale relations to mathematically and physically consistent macroscale relations. These macroscale relations are adequate for describing the tumor behavior while filtering out high frequency spatial variability. The governing equations of the model are closed by constitutive relations at the macroscale.The multiphase system is comprised of the following compartments: (i) tumor cells (TCs), which partition into living cells (LTC) and necrotic cells (NTC); (ii) healthy cells (HCs); (iii) extracellular matrix (ECM); and (iv) interstitial fluid (IF); see  [21,22]. The ECM is a porous solid, while all other phases are fluids. The tumor cells may become necrotic upon exposure to low nutrient concentrations or excessive mechanical pressure. The IF, transporting nutrients, is a mixture of water and biomolecules, such as nutrients, oxygen and waste products. In the following mass and momentum balance equations,αdenotes a generic phase,tthe tumor cells (TCs),hthe healthy cells (HCs),sthe solid phase (ECM), andlthe interstitial fluid (IF).The representative elementary volume of the multiphase system is depicted in the inset of Fig. 1which shows an outline of the different stages of the modeling process.A short overview of the mathematical model is given next; additional details are available in  [23]. We use both vectorial and indicial notation where convenient.The ECM is a deformable porous solid with porosityε. The volume fraction of the solid phase isεs=1−ε. The other phases, tumor cells (εt), healthy cells (εh) and interstitial fluid (εl), occupy the rest of the volume. The volume fractions for all phases add up to unity(1)εs+εh+εt+εl=1.The saturation degree of a fluid phaseαis:Sα=εα/ε. Using porosity,ε, and volume fraction,εα, (1) yields(2)Sh+St+Sl=1.As in the previous work  [22], the primary variables of the model are: differential pressuresphlandpth, IF pressurepl, nutrient mass fractionωnl¯, and displacementusof solid phase (ECM).The macroscopic mass and momentum balance equations of phases and species have been derived in  [21] and their transformation to take into account of the differential pressures as primary variables has been obtained in  [22]. The model has been enhanced in  [28] to include ECM deposition by the tumor cells through new mass exchange terms,MECMl→s, and lysis,Mlysist→l. The final form of the governing equations shown below are obtained from the general forms (see  [22,28]) by introducing some simplifications and closure relationships (e.g., a Fickian type equation for diffusion of species, a generalized Darcy’s equation for flow of the fluid phases, etc.).The mass balance equation of the ECM is(3)∂ε∂t=∇⋅vs¯+(1−ε)ρs∂ρs∂t−∇⋅(εvs¯)−MECMl→sρs.The mass balance equation of TCs reads(4)[εStKt+St(1−ε)Ks(St+pth∂St∂pth)+ε∂St∂pth]∂pth∂t+[εStKt+St(1−ε)Ks(1−Sl−phl∂Sl∂phl)]∂phl∂t+[εStKt+St(1−ε)Ks]∂pl∂t=∇⋅[kreltkμt⋅∇(pl+phl+pth)]−St(1:ds̄̄)−∇St⋅(εvs¯)+1ρt(Mgrowthl→t−Mlysist→l)+StMECMl→sρs.The mass balance equation of HCs is(5)[Sh(1−ε)Ks(St+pth∂St∂pth)−ε∂St∂pth]∂pth∂St+[εShKh+Sh(1−ε)Ks(1−Sl−phl∂Sl∂phl)−ε∂Sl∂phl]∂phl∂Sh+[εShKh+Sh(1−ε)Ks]∂pl∂t=∇⋅(krelhkμh⋅∇(pl+phl))−Sh(1:ds̄̄)−∇Sh⋅(εvs¯)+ShMECMl→sρs.The mass balance equation of IF reads(6)Sl(1−ε)Ks(pth∂St∂pth+St)∂pth∂t+[Sl(1−ε)Ks(1−phl∂Sl∂phl−Sl)+ε∂Sl∂phl]∂phl∂t+(Sl(1−ε)Ks+εSlKl)∂pl∂t=∇⋅[krellkμl⋅∇pl]−Sl(1:ds̄̄)−∇Sl⋅(εvs¯)−1ρl(Mgrowthl→t−Mlysist→l)−1ρlMECMl→swhereμαis the dynamic viscosity,krelαis relative permeability,ραis the density,pαis the pressure of theαphase (α=h,landt) andpαβis the differential pressure of phasesαβ. Also,ds̄̄is the Eulerian rate of strain tensor,kthe intrinsic permeability tensor of the ECM, andMgrowthl→tis an inter-phase exchange of mass between the phaseslandt, and represents the mass of IF consumed by tumor cell growth.Kiis the compressibility of phasei(withi=s,t,handl). For all other terms refer to the nomenclature.Summing Eqs. (4)–(6), using the constraint equations on volume fractions and saturation, Eqs. (1), (2) gives (see  [22])(7)[εStKt+1−εKs(St+pth∂St∂pth)]∂pth∂t+[εStKt+εShKh+1−εKs(1−Sl−phl∂Sl∂phl)]∂phl∂t+(εStKt+εShKh+εSlKl+1−εKs)∂pl∂t=∇⋅[kreltkμt⋅∇pth]+∇⋅[(kreltkμt+krelhkμh)⋅∇phl]+∇⋅[(kreltkμt+krelhkμh+krellkμl)⋅∇pl]−(1:ds̄̄)+ρl−ρtρtρl(Mgrowthl→t−Mlysist→l)+ρl−ρsρsρlMECMl→s.Eqs. (4), (5) and (7) which incorporate Eq. (3) are three of the governing equations of the model.After some transformation  [22] the mass balance equation for the necrotic tumor cells can be rewritten as:(8)∂ωNt¯∂t=1εStρt[εtrNt−(ωNt¯(Mgrowthl→t−Mlysist→l)−Mlysist→l)−(εStρtvt¯)⋅∇ωNt¯]whereωNt¯is the mass fraction of TCs,vt¯the velocity of the tumor cells, andεtrNtis the death rate of tumor cells, i.e. the rate of generation of necrotic cells. This reaction termεtrNtis an intra-phase exchange term (see  [23]);Mlysist→ltakes into account of mass exchange between the necrotic compartment of tumor cells and the IF phase.The mass balance equation of the nutrient reads(9)εSl∂ωnl∂t−∇⋅(εSlDeffnl∇ωnl)=1ρl(ωnl((Mgrowthl→t−Mlysist→l)+MECMl→s)−Mnl→t)−εSlvl¯∇ωnlwhereDeffnl¯is the effective diffusivity of the nutrient species in the extracellular space,ωnlthe mass fraction of nutrient speciesnandMnl→tis the mass of nutrient consumed by tumor cells via metabolism and growth. Eq. (9) is another governing equation of the model.The last governing equation of the parent model is the linear momentum balance of the solid phase expressed in rate form  [29] as(10)∇⋅(∂teffs̄̄∂t−ᾱ∂ps∂t1)=0where the interaction between the solid and the three fluid phases is accounted for through the effective stressteffs̄̄in the sense of porous media mechanics(11)teffs̄̄=ts̄̄+ᾱps1where1is the unit tensor,ts̄̄is the total stress tensor in the solid phase,ᾱis the Biot’s coefficientᾱ=1−K/Ks, withKthe compressibility of the empty ECM. In the modeled problem,K/Kstends to zero hence we can assume a Biot’s coefficient equal to 1. The solid pressurepsis given as in  [27](12)ps=Shph+Stpt+Slpl=pl+(1−Sl)phl+Stpthwhere the Bishop parameter of each fluid phase (solid surface fraction in contact with the phase) has been taken equal to its own degree of saturation. A large deformation regime is assumed for the elasto-visco-plastic ECM (solid phase)  [22,23].The constitutive relationships for the fluid phases have been extensively dealt with in  [23,30]. The constitutive equations for growth, necrosis, and nutrient consumption are given in  [21,23] and the relationships to take into account of the ECM deposition by tumor cells and lysis are illustrated in  [23].Tumor growth depends on oxygen/nutrient concentration. When the oxygen mass fraction is lower than a critical value the tumor living cells produce TAF (Tumor Angiogenic Factor) in response to hypoxia. TAF diffuses in the surrounding tissue. Diffusion of TAF creates a chemical gradient between the tumor and any existing vasculature. Endothelial cells, lining in blood vessels, respond to the TAF: first they degrade the parent venule basement membrane and then migrate through the disrupted membrane towards the tumor. The initial response of endothelial cells to the TAF is a chemotactic one. Small finger-like capillary sprouts are formed by accumulation of endothelial cells which are recruited from the parent vessel. The sprouts grow in length due to the migration and further recruitment of endothelial cells  [31].In our model TAF is a new chemical species that diffuses and is advected in the interstitial liquid phase. The mass balance equation of TAF is similar to that of a nutrient:(13)εSl∂ωTAF∂t−∇⋅(εSlDeffTAF∇ωTAF)=1ρl(ωTAFMl→t−MTAF→t)−εSlvl⋅∇ωTAF.The production of TAF depends on the tumor living cell mass fraction, on a coefficientcand on a function of oxygen concentration to take into account of hypoxia. The demise of TAF comes with the degradation at rateβTAFand with the uptake of TAF by endothelial cells  [31,32]. The sink termMTAF→tin Eq. (13) takes hence the following form:(14)MTAF→t=c⋅F(ωoxy)⋅(1−ωNt¯)εSt−νTAF⋅ωEC⋅ωTAF−βTAF⋅ωTAFwith the functionF(ωoxy)={12+12cos[π(ωoxyωcritoxy)]for0≤ωoxy≤ωcritoxy0forωoxy≥ωcritoxywhereωoxyis the mass fraction of oxygen,ωcritoxyis the value of oxygen concentration for hypoxia,νTAFis a coefficient for the uptake of TAF by endothelial cells,ωECis the endothelial cells mass fraction andωTAFis the TAF concentration.In response to the TAF, endothelial cells migrate from a blood vessel towards the tumor, creating a capillary network. We assume that the density of capillary vessels is proportional to the endothelial cells density as in  [31]. In our model the endothelial cells are simulated by a new chemical species that also diffuses in the interstitial liquid phase. The mass balance equation for endothelial cells is(15)εSl∂ωEC∂t−∇⋅(εSlDeffEC∇ωEC)+∇⋅(εSlDeffEC∇ωTAF)=1ρl(ωECMl→t−MEC→t)−εSlvl⋅∇ωEC.The sink termMEC→tin Eq. (15) is(16)MEC→t=c⋅P(ωEC)⋅ωEC−c⋅K(ωTAF)⋅ωECwith the functionP(ωEC)={12+12cos[π(ωECωcritEC)]for0≤ωEC≤ωcritEC0forωEC≥ωcritECand functionK(ωTAF)={12+12cos[π(1+ωTAFωcritTAF)]for0≤ωTAF≤ωcritTAF1forωTAF≥ωcritTAF.The first term in Eq. (16) takes into account of production of endothelial cells when their concentrationωECis lower than a critical valueωcritECand the second term represents the death of endothelial cells when the TAF concentration is low. The direction of endothelial cell flux is governed also by the gradient of TAF concentration as we can see in Eq. (15). The endothelial cells create a capillary network that brings oxygen to the tumor. Hence we add a new term in the mass balance equation of oxygen, Eq. (9), proportional to the endothelial cells concentration in the sink:ϕ⋅ωEC, whereϕis a coefficient.(17)Moxy→t=[γgrowthnl¯〈ωnl¯−ωcritnl¯ωenvnl¯−ωcritnl¯〉+H(pcritt−pt)+γ0nl¯sin(π2ωnl¯ωenvnl¯)](1−ωNt¯)εSt+ϕ⋅ωEC.The terms within the square brackets in Eq. (17) are given in  [21].Possible co-opted vasculature is modeled either as boundary condition or as line elements with flow and there is only mass exchange (blood) with the neovasculature which is a continuum. The enhanced equations have been introduced in the finite elements code CAST3M (http://www-cast3m.cea.fr) of the French Atomic Energy Commission where the avascular model is already implemented. This is explained next.The weak form of Eqs. (4), (5), (7), (9) and (10) is obtained by means of the standard Galerkin procedure and is then discretized in space by means of the finite element method  [32]. Integration in the time domain is carried out by the Finite Difference Method adopting a quasi-Crank–Nicolson scheme (θ-Wilson method withθ=0.52). Within each time step the equations are linearized by the Newton–Raphson method. For the FE discretization the primary variables are expressed in terms of their nodal values as(18)ωnl¯(t)≅Nnω̄nl¯(t)ωTAF¯(t)≅NTAFω̄TAF¯(t)ωEC¯(t)≅NECω̄EC¯(t)pth(t)≅Ntp̄th(t)phl(t)≅Nhp̄hl(t)pl(t)≅Nlp̄l(t)us(t)≅Nuūs(t)whereω̄nl¯(t),ω̄TAF¯(t),ω̄EC¯(t),p̄th(t),p̄ht(t),p̄l(t),ūs(t)are vectors of nodal values of the primary variables at time instantt, andNn,NTAF,NEC,Nt,Nh,Nl, andNuare vectors of shape functions related to these variables.For the numerical solution of the resulting system of equations, a staggered scheme is adopted with iterations within each time step to preserve the coupled nature of the system. The convergence properties of such staggered schemes have been investigated by Turska et al.  [33]. In particular, for the iteration convergence within each computational step a lower limit ofΔt/h2, a function of the material properties, has to be observed;Δtis the time step and h the element size. Such a limit has also been found by Murthy et al.  [34] for Poisson equations and by Rank et al.  [35] invoking the discrete maximum principle. The existence of this limit means that we cannot diminish the time step below a certain threshold without also decreasing the element size.Five computational units are used in the staggered scheme: the first is for the nutrient mass fractionω̄nl¯, the second for the TAF mass fractionω̄TAF¯, the third is for the endothelial cells mass fractionω̄EC¯, the fourth to computep̄th,p̄hlandp̄l, and the fifth is used to obtain the displacement vectorūs. Within each iteration the mass fraction of NTC,ωNt̄, is updated using Eq. (8).Taking into account the chosen staggered scheme, the final system of equations can be expressed in matrix form as follows, where some of the coupling terms have been placed in the source terms and are updated at each iteration to preserve the coupled nature of the problem(19)Cij(x)∂x∂t+Kij(x)x=fi(x)with(20)Cij=(Cnn0000000CTT0000000CEE0000000CttCthCtl0000ChtChhCtl0000CltClhCll0000000Cuu)Kij=(Knn0000000KTT0000000KEE0000000KttKthKtl0000KhtKhhKhl0000KltKlhKll00000000),fi=(fnfTfEftfhflfu)wherexT={ω̄nl¯,ω̄TAF¯,ω̄EC¯,p̄th,p̄hl,p̄l,ūs}. The nonlinear coefficient matricesCij(x),Kij(x)andfi(x)are given in the Appendix.The endothelial cells diffusion dependence on TAF concentration has been taken into account in the code by adding a coupling matrix for the endothelial cells and the TAF as a condition on the diffusion of the endothelial cells.The modular computational structure allows more than one chemical species to be taken into account, simply by adding a computational unit (equivalent to the first one used for the nutrient) for each of the additional chemical species considered.
