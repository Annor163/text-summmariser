@&#ABSTRACT@&#
For a current deregulated power system, a large amount of operating reserve is often required to maintain the reliability of the power system using traditional approaches. In this paper, we propose a two-stage robust optimization model to address the network constrained unit commitment problem under uncertainty. In our approach, uncertain problem parameters are assumed to be within a given uncertainty set. We study cases with and without transmission capacity and ramp-rate limits (The latter case was described in Zhang and Guan (2009), for which the analysis part is included in Section 3 in this paper). We also analyze solution schemes to solve each problem that include an exact solution approach and an efficient heuristic approach that provides tight lower and upper bounds for the general network constrained robust unit commitment problem. The final computational experiments on an IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of our approaches, as compared to the nominal model without considering the uncertainty.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
For a current deregulated power system, the demands on a power system are highly uncertain (e.g., see Mazer, 2007) due to weather, demand response program, and other conditions. This brings great challenges in grid management and generation scheduling to power system operators. To address this uncertainty, most electric power markets in US execute reliability unit commitment runs after the closure of the day-ahead market, and ensure enough generation capacity for the next operating day (e.g., see Whittle et al., 2006). Stochastic programming approaches have been shown efficient to solve unit commitment problems under uncertainty. For instance, a multistage stochastic programming formulation and Lagrangian solution techniques were developed early in Takriti and Birge (2000). This approach was further studied considering incorporating fuel constraints and electricity spot prices (Takriti et al., 2000). Other relevant Lagrangian decomposition literature includes (Carpentier et al., 1996; Dentcheva and Römisch, 1997; Gollmer et al., 2000). Recently, the stochastic programming approach for unit commitment was applied to solve hydro-electric unit commitment subject to uncertain demand (Philpott et al., 2000), to generate supply curves in electric power markets (Philpott and Schultz, 2006), to serve as a decision aid for scheduling and hedging in the wholesale electric power markets (Sen et al., 2006), to help a power generation company take part in an electricity spot market (Cerisola et al., 2009), to help provide self-commitment of one generating unit under the deregulated market (Valenzuela and Mazumdar, 2003), and to estimate the potential contribution of demand flexibility in replacing operating reserves (Papavasiliou and Oren, 2010). Other recent related unit commitment studies include developing a real options approach to address short-term generation asset valuation (Tseng and Barz, 2002), evaluating the value of rolling-horizon policies for risk-averse hydro-thermal planning (Guigues and Sagastizábal, 2012), deriving an optimal scheduling policy for a hydro thermal power generation system (Oliveira et al., 1993), studying efficient algorithms for combined heat and power systems under the deregulated electricity market (Rong and Lahdelma, 2007; Rong et al., 2008), and deriving a floating-point genetic algorithm to solve the unit commitment problem (Dang and Li, 2007).Besides the traditional two-stage and multi-stage stochastic programming approaches with the objective of minimizing the total expected cost, risk averse objectives, such as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) (Jabr, 2005), and chance constraints (Wang et al., 2012) are also introduced in power industry to control risk and ensure the feasibility. To solve the stochastic optimization problems, scenarios are usually generated based on the forecasted demand distributions. This usually leads to a large scale deterministic equivalent formulation and accordingly decomposition algorithms are developed to achieve tractable computation (Papavasiliou and Oren, 2010; Takriti and Birge, 2000). In this research, we emphasize risk rather than cost, because reliability has very high priority for system operators, which is also the reason to introduce reliability unit commitment runs. Thus, we propose a two-stage robust optimization approach (Ben-Tal and Nemirovski, 1998; El Ghaoui and Lebret, 1997; Bertsimas and Sim, 2003) to address uncertainty. Instead of providing a detailed description of the probability distributions, the uncertain parameters are assumed to be within a polyhedral uncertainty set (cf. Bertsimas and Sim, 2003; Bienstock and Özbay, 2008; Yao et al., 2009). Our proposed robust optimization approach can serve as a complement of the stochastic programming approaches, as well as the current reliability unit commitment run practice.In our approach, we provide unit commitment decisions in the first stage with the objective of minimizing the system-wide power generation costs including the unit commitment cost and dispatch cost under the worst-case scenarios. Our initial study on the two-stage robust unit commitment problem is described in Zhang and Guan (2009), for which the analysis part is included in Section 3 in this paper. Besides, for the single-stage robust optimization approach, the readers are referred to the initial studies on solving the contingency-constrained unit commitment with n–K security criterion described in Street et al. (2011) and on solving the optimal bidding strategy problem described in Baringo and Conejo (2011). Related two-stage robust optimization approaches include (Zhao and Zeng, 2012; Bertsimas et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2012). In Zhao and Zeng (2012), a two-stage robust optimization model with one-dimensional demand uncertainty set (along time horizon) is proposed to solve an aggregated model without considering transmission constraints. In Bertsimas et al. (2013), a two-stage robust optimization model also with one-dimensional demand uncertainty set (along different buses for a given time unit) is introduced, and a heuristic separation approach is studied to test a real instance. In Jiang et al. (2012), a special case of this work is studied, in which a different one-dimensional cardinality uncertainty set is provided and a heuristic approach is developed to solve the problem with the consideration of pumped storage hydro. Besides the initial study for the two-stage robust unit commitment problem, as compared to the related two-stage robust optimization approaches (i.e., Zhao and Zeng, 2012; Bertsimas et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2012), our additional contributions can be summarized as follows:•We introduce a two-dimensional uncertainty set to describe the uncertain problem parameters. That is, we allow the uncertainty correlations among different buses and among different time periods, as compared to the one-dimensional uncertainty sets studied in related works.We develop an exact and a bilinear heuristic separation approaches to solve the robust unit commitment problem. Our bilinear separation approach can generate tight lower and upper bounds for the optimal objective value, and is computationally efficient as demonstrated in the computational experiments on an IEEE 118-bus system.We analyze the insights of the problem by studying a simplified version of the problem. The properties of the objective value functions are analyzed. In addition, the separation problem is shown NP-hard, which indicates the problem is hard to solve in general. Meanwhile, our computational results show that this simplified model provides a very tight lower bound for the problem.We introduce a Benders’ decomposition framework that includes both feasibility and optimality cuts. The feasibility cuts in the Benders’ decomposition framework help address important feasibility issues for the real-time market. Our computational results indicate that the proposed approach will generate significant cost savings, under the worst-case scenarios, as compared to the traditional nominal model.The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the mathematical formulation for the general network constrained robust unit commitment problem. In addition, we show that the spinning reserve constraints are not necessary for the robust optimization model. Section 3 develops a solution approach and explores insights for a simplified version of the network constrained robust unit commitment problem. In Section 4, we explore the solution schemes to solve the general network constrained robust unit commitment problem. Section 5 reports the extensive computational results. Finally, Section 6 concludes our study.For a T-period network constrained unit commitment problem, we letE={1,2,…,M}andN={1,n,…,N}represent the sets of buses and generators, andArepresent the set of transmission lines linking two buses. For each busm∈E, we letNmbe the set of generators in this bus. Accordingly, for each generatori∈Nm, we letSimWimrepresent the start-up (shut-down) cost,GimHimrepresent the minimum-up (minimum-down) time,LimUimrepresent the minimum (maximum) output of electricity if the generator is on,VimBimrepresent the ramp-up (ramp-down) rate limit, andV‾imB‾imrepresent the start-up (shut-down) ramp rate limit. For each transmission line(i,j)∈A, we let Cijrepresent the capacity of the transmission line, andKijmrepresent the line flow distribution factor for the transmission line, due to the net injection at bus m,∀m∈E. To describe the uncertainty set, we letD‾mt,Dmtℓ, andDmturepresent the nominal demand, the lower and upper bounds of the demand at bus m in time period t. In addtion, we letDmtr≔Dmtu-Dmtℓ.For our two-stage network constrained robust unit commitment problem, in the first stage we provide the unit commitment decisionsyitm,uitm,vitmfor each generator that include: 1) if generator i at bus m is on or not in time period t (i.e.,yitm=1if yes;yitm=0o.w.), 2) if generator i at bus m is started up or not in time period t (i.e.,uitm=1if yes;uitm=0o.w.), and 3) if generator i at bus m is shut down or not in time period t (i.e.,vitm=1if yes;vitm=0o.w.). In the second stage, we let random parameter dmtrepresent the demand at bus m in time period t, and decision variablexitmrepresent the amount of electricity generated by generator i at bus m in time period t. In addition, we approximate the non-decreasing convex fuel costfitmxitm=citmxitm2+bitmxitm+aitmby a P-piece piecewise linear functionfitmxitm⩾αitmpyitm+βitmpxitm,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,1⩽p⩽P. Then the two-stage network constrained robust unit commitment problem can be described as follows:(1)zR=miny,u,v∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈NmSimuitm+Wimvitm+maxd∈Dmin(x,ϑ)∈X(y,d)∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈Nmϑitms.t.-yi(t-1)m+yitm-yikm⩽0,1⩽k-(t-1)⩽Gim,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈T(2)yi(t-1)m-yitm+yikm⩽1,1⩽k-(t-1)⩽Him,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈T(3)(NC-RUC)-yi(t-1)m+yitm-uitm⩽0,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈T(4)yi(t-1)m-yitm-vitm⩽0,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈T(5)∑m=1M∑i∈NmUimyitm⩾(1+R%)∑m=1MD‾mt,∀t∈Tyitm,uitm,vitm∈{0,1},∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈T,whereX(y,d)=(6)(x,ϑ):Limyitm⩽xitm⩽Uimyitm,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈T(7)xitm-xi(t-1)m⩽2-yi(t-1)m-yitmV‾im+(1+yi(t-1)m-yitm)Vim,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈T(8)xi(t-1)m-xitm⩽2-yi(t-1)m-yitmB‾im+1-yi(t-1)m+yitmBim,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈T(9)∑m=1M∑i∈Nmxitm=∑m=1Mdmt,∀t∈T(10)-Cij⩽∑m=1MKijm∑n∈Nmxntm-dmt⩽Cij,∀(i,j)∈A,∀t∈T(11)ϑitm⩾αitmpyitm+βitmpxitm,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀p∈P,∀t∈TandDis a given uncertainty set that defines the range for the demands to be flexible:(12)D=d:Dmtℓ⩽dmt⩽Dmtu,∀m∈E,∀t,∑m=1Mπmtdmt⩽π¯t,∀t,∑m=1M∑t=1Tπmtdmt⩽π¯0.In (12), πmtrepresents the weight for the demand in bus m at time t,π¯tis the given upper bound of the total weighted demand for time period t, andπ¯0is the given upper bound of the total weighted demand for the planning horizon. Without loss of generality, we assumeDmtℓ,Dmtu,πmt,π¯t, andπ¯0are integers. For this uncertainty set (12), the budgets are imposed on the total weighted demand among all buses at each time period (i.e.,∑m=1Mπmtdmt⩽π¯t,∀t) as well as on the total weighted demand over all time periods (i.e.,∑t=1T∑m=1Mπmtdmt⩽π¯0). Thus, this proposed uncertainty set is two-dimensional (including both temporal and spatial elements), which is more general as compared to the related works which are one-dimensional. Also, as compared to the related models imposing budget constraints on total absolute variations of demand from the nominal value, e.g.,∑m=1M|dmt-D‾mt|/(Dmtμ-Dmtℓ)⩽π¯t, in this paper, we bound the total weighted demand from above. The parametersDmtℓ,Dmtu,π¯t, andπ¯0can be easily obtained from historical data. For instance, we can setDmtℓandDmtuequal to the .05 and .95-quantiles of the demand forecast, respectively, and we can similarly obtain the values ofπ¯tandπ¯0. For example, if πmt=1 for each m and t, we can setπ¯tequal to the .90-quantile of the total demand forecast in time period t, andπ¯0equal to the .90-quantile of the total demand forecast in the whole planning horizon.Our objective is to minimize the total cost, including start-up, shut-down, and fuel costs, under the worst-case scenario. Constraints (1) describe the minimum-up time required for generator i once it is started up. Accordingly, constraints (2) describe the minimum-down time required for generator i once it is shut down. Constraints (3) and (4) indicate the start-up and shut-down operations for each generator i. Constraints (5) describe the spinning reserve requirement for the power system in each period t, where R% represents the spinning reserve percentage. Constraints (6) describe the upper and lower bounds of power output of generator i if it is on in period t. Constraints (7) and (8) describe the ramp-up/ramp-down and start-up/shut-down ramp rate limit restrictions. Note here that in this paper, ramping constraints combine ramp-rate limit restriction when a generator is on and first-hour (last-hour) generation amount restriction as described in Guan et al. (1992). Constraints (9) ensure the power system flow balance. Finally, we follow the work in Wang et al. (1995) to describe the transmission capacity limits in constraints (10), which is the lossless linearized DC approximation of AC power flow governed by Kirchhoff’s laws.Before discussing the solution approaches, we observe that spinning reserve constraints (5) are not necessary for the robust optimization formulation whenDis set properly. First, we call a solution (y,u,v) first-stage feasible to (NC-RUC) without constraints (5), if (y,u,v) satisfies constraints (1)–(4) and for anyd∈D, there exists at least one second-stage solution (x,ϑ) that satisfies constraints (6)–(11). Then, we haveProposition 1Any first-stage feasible solution (y,u,v) to (NC-RUC) without constraints(5)automatically satisfies spinning reserve constraints(5), when the uncertainty setDsatisfies the following conditions: (i)Dmtu⩾(1+R%)D‾mt,∀m,t, (ii)∑m=1Mπmt(1+R%)D‾mt⩽π¯t,∀t, and (iii)∑s=1s≠tT∑m=1MπmsDmsℓ+∑m=1Mπmt(1+R%)D‾mt⩽π¯0,∀t.Prove by contradiction. We assume the conclusion is not true. That is, there exists a first-stage feasible solution(yˆ,uˆ,vˆ)to (NC-RUC) without (5) and withDsatisfying the conditions, whileyˆdoes not satisfy constraints (5) for a particular period τ, i.e.,(13)∑m=1M∑i∈NmUimyˆiτm<(1+R%)∑m=1MD‾mτ.On the other hand, since(yˆ,uˆ,vˆ)is first-stage feasible, for eachd∈D, there should exist at least a second-stage solution(xˆ(d),ϑˆ(d))satisfying constraints (6)–(11). Corresponding to constraints (9) for time period τ, we have(14)∑m=1M∑i∈Nmxˆiτm(d)=∑m=1Mdmτ,∀d∈D.Now we pick adˆ∈Dsuch thatdˆmt=(1+R%)D‾mt,ift=τDmtℓ,o.w.,∀m∈E.Note here that the abovedˆsatisfies all inequalities in (12) in view of conditions (i), (ii) and (iii), which verifies thatdˆis inD. Following the definition ofdˆ, we have∑m=1Mdˆmτ=∑m=1M(1+R%)D‾mτ. Then, based on (14) and (6), we have∑m=1M(1+R%)D‾mτ=∑m=1M∑i∈Nmxˆiτm(dˆ)⩽∑m=1M∑i∈NmUimyˆiτm,which contradicts with (13). Therefore, the original conclusion holds. □.We first consider the case in which transmission capacity and ramp-rate limits are relaxed. This is the robust optimization version of the simplified unit commitment problem. It will help us (i) to understand the insights of the basic problem structure, and (ii) to obtain a lower bound for the general network constrained robust unit commitment problem. Also, as we will see in this section, the second-stage problem of this relaxation model is time-decomposable and so can be efficiently solved. In Section 5, we find that this relaxation can provide a very tight lower bound for the general robust unit commitment model.In this case, for notation brevity, we omit the index m in the formulation. To illustrate the main results, we assume the fuel cost is linear (e.g.,fit(xit)=αit+βitxit,∀i∈N). Note that our conclusion for the multiple-piece approximation case also holds. In addition, for analysis completeness, we introduce ztand wtto represent the generation curtailment and load shedding amount of electricity at time period t, and accordingly, let Ptand Rtrepresent the unit generation curtailment and load shedding cost. Without loss of generality, we assume(15)-Pt<0<β1t⩽β2t⩽…⩽βNt<Rt,∀t.The corresponding robust optimization model can be simplified as follows:(16)miny,u,v∑t=1T∑i∈N(Siuit+Wivit+αityit)+maxd∈Dmin(x,z,w)∈X(y,d)∑t=1T∑i∈Nβitxit+Rtwt+Ptzt(RUC)s.t.Constraints(1)–(4)withoutindexm,whereX(y,d)={(x,z,w):Liyit⩽xit⩽Uiyit,∑i∈Nxit+wt-zt=dt,xit,zt,wt⩾0,i∈N,∀t}(17)andD=d:∑t=1Tπtdt⩽π¯0,Dtℓ⩽dt⩽Dtu,∀twithDtℓandDturepresenting the lower and upper bounds for the demand in time period t, where parametersDtℓ,Dtu, πt, and π0 are integers.To solve (RUC), we first analyze the optimal value function gt(yt, dt) for the subproblem in the second stage once the first stage decision variable (y,u,v) is fixed. In this case, (RUC) is decomposed into T subproblems. Corresponding to each time period t, we have(18)gt(yt,dt)=min∑i∈Nβitxit+Rtwt+Ptzts.t.Liyit⩽xit⩽Uiyit,i∈N,(19)∑i∈Nxit+wt-zt=dt,xit,zt,wt⩾0,i∈N.In the optimal solution for the subproblem corresponding to each time period t, we havezt∗=(∑i∈NLiyit-dt)+andwt∗=(dt-∑i∈NUiyit)+, where x+=max{x,0}.Proposition 2The value function gt(yt,dt) is piecewise linear and convex in dt. In addition, it can be described in closed form as shown in(20), (21), and(22).From constraints (18) and (19), based on the cost relationship shown in (15), we can observe:•Ifdt⩽∑i=1NLiyit, then in the optimal solution, each generator generates at its lower bound and the generation curtailment amount is∑i=1NLiyit-dt. The total cost is(20)gt(yt,dt)=ϕt0(dt)=∑i=1NβitLiyit+Pt∑i=1NLiyit-dt=φt0(y)-Ptdt,whereφt0(y)=∑i=1NβitLiyit+Pt∑i=1NLiyit.Ifdt⩾∑i=1NUiyit, then in the optimal solution, each generator generates at its upper bound. The load shedding amount isdt-∑i=1NUiyit. The total cost is(21)gt(yt,dt)=ϕt(N+1)(dt)=∑i=1NβitUiyit+Rtdt-∑i=1NUiyit=φt(N+1)(y)+Rtdt,whereφt(N+1)(y)=∑i=1NβitUiyit-Rt∑i=1NUiyit.For the general case, assuming∑i=θNLiyit+∑i=1θ-1Uiyit⩽dt⩽∑i=θ+1NLiyit+∑i=1θUiyit, θ=1,…,N, the total cost is(22)gt(yt,dt)=ϕtθ(dt)=∑i=θ+1NβitLiyit+∑i=1θ-1βitUiyit+βθt(dt-∑i=θ+1NLiyit-∑i=1θ-1Uiyit)=φtθ(y)+βθtdt,whereφtθ(y)=∑i=θ+1NβitLiyit+∑i=1θ-1βitUiyit-βθt∑i=θ+1NLiyit-βθt∑i=1θ-1Uiyit.From (20), (21), and (22), we can observe that ϕtθ(dt), θ=0,…,N+1, is a linear function of dt. Based on (15) andϕtθ∑i=θ+1NLiyit+∑i=1θUiyit=ϕt(θ+1)∑i=θ+1NLiyit+∑i=1θUiyit=∑i=θ+1NβitLiyit+∑i=1θβitUiyit, we have that the value function gt(yt,dt) is piecewise linear and convex in dt. Therefore, the conclusion holds. □Since the value function gt(yt,dt) is piecewise linear and convex, the following corollary holds. □The value functiongt(yt,dt)=maxθt=0,…,N+1ϕtθt(dt), where θtrepresents the value of θ at time period t as shown in(20), (21), and(22).Based on the conclusion obtained in Proposition 2 and Corollary 1, RUC) can be reformulated asminy,u,v∑t=1T∑i=1N(αityit+Siuit+Wivit)+maxd∈D∑t=1Tgt(yt,dt)=∑t=1T∑i=1N(αityit+Siuit+Wivit)+maxd∈D∑t=1Tmaxθt=0,…,N+1ϕtθt(dt)s.t.Constraints(16)yit,uit,vit∈{0,1},i∈N,∀t.Now we can introduce a new continuous decision variable μ for the second stage as follows:(23)miny,u,v∑t=1T∑i=1N(αityit+Siuit+Wivit)+μs.t.μ⩾∑t=1Tmaxθt=0,…,N+1ϕtθt(dt)foralld∈D,Constraints(16)yit,uit,vit∈{0,1},i∈N,∀t,μ∈R.In the optimal solution, for a given (y,u,v), sinceϕtθt(dt)andϕt′θt′(dt′)are mutually independent, we have(24)μ=max{θt}t=1T∈{0,1,…,N+1}Tmax∑t=1Tϕtθt(dt):d∈D.Note here that for a given θt, the dual of (24) can be described as follows:minπ¯0ζ+∑t=1TDtuηt-Dtℓρt+∑t=1Tφtθt(y)(Dual)s.t.πtζ+ηt-ρt=ϑtθt,∀t,ζ,η,ρ⩾0,whereϑtθtis the coefficient of dtin functionϕtθt(dt). That is,ϑtθt=-Ptif θt=0,ϑtθt=Rtif θt=N+1, andϑtθt=βθttif 1⩽θt⩽N. We also notice thatφtθt(y)is a constant number here for the dual problem once t, θtand y are given.Therefore, the problem can be solved using the Benders’ decomposition algorithm (the framework is similar to the one described in Section 4). For instance, we do not need to consider constraints (23) in our initial first-stage master problem. When θtfor each t is given, we can add the dual constraints, which are linear, to the first-stage master problem. In the remaining part of this section, we analyze the following separation problem with the uncertainty set (17) given.Separation Problem (SP): Given a solution (y,u,v,μ), does there exist (θ1,…,θT) andd∈D, such thatμ<∑t=1Tϕtθt(dt)?Theorem 1The separation problem (SP) is NP-hard under the budget uncertainty setDas described in(17).We prove the claim by reducing a 0–1 knapsack problem to (SP). Given an instance of a 0–1 knapsack problem (e.g.,max{cx:ux⩽b,x∈{0,1}T,b∈Z+}), we construct a separation problem (SP) as follows:There are T time periods and 2T generators. At each time period t, only two generators 2t−1 and 2t are turned on. Assume that the minimum-up and minimum-down times for both generators are one time period. In addition, the maximum outputs of generators 2t−1 and 2t are ut−1 and 1(with minimum outputs to be zeros for both), and the corresponding unit production costs are 0 and ct, respectively. The budget uncertainty set isD=d:∑t=1Tdt⩽b,0⩽dt⩽ut,b∈Z+.From the above constructed separation problem (SP), we can observe that for each time period, we use generator 2t−1 to satisfy the demand if dt⩽ut−1, because the unit production cost is zero. If dt=ut, then we have to use generator 2t to produce one unit at the cost ct. Therefore, it can be observed that there exists an optimal (SP) solution d∗, such that for any t,dt∗is either 0 or ut. It is equivalent to the knapsack solution with the same objective value. Therefore, the separation problem with uncertainty setDis NP-hard. □Since the separation problem under the budget uncertainty set is closely related to the knapsack problem, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm to solve it. Given a first stage solution y, we will determine the extreme scenario d which gives the most violated constraint, or determine that the current solution is feasible. The algorithm is based on the following observation.Observation 1For any extreme scenariod∈D, there exists a time period t, such that for any t′≠t,dt′=Dt′ℓorDt′u.This observation is obtained by the convexity of function gt(yt, dt) and the extreme points of uncertainty setD. Moreover, we can derive the following lemma for the extreme scenario d.Lemma 1For any extreme scenariod∈Dwith respect to the first stage solution (y,μ), ifdt∈∑i=θNLiyit+∑i=1θ-1Uiyit,∑i=θ+1NLiyit+∑i=1θUiyitfor some θ, then d corresponds to the optimal solution of the following knapsack problemmaxztθ=∑j∈Jgjyj,Dju-gjyj,Djℓsjtθ(SPNtθ)s.t.∑j∈JπjDju-Djℓsjtθ⩽πˆ0,sjtθ∈{0,1},j∈J,where J={j:βθt/πt⩽Rj/πj,j≠t},πˆ0=π¯0-∑j≠tπjDjℓ-πt∑i=θNLiyit+∑i=1θ-1Uiyit, andsjtθis the indicator of dj(i.e.,sjtθ=0ifdj=Djℓ, andsjtθ=1ifdj=Dju).From the definition of J, if j∉J and j≠t, then we can observe thatdj=Djℓin the extreme scenario. If not, thendj=Djubased on Observation 1. Then, decreasing djby a small δ/πj>0 while increasing dtby δ/πtwill increase the second stage cost by δ (βθt/πt−Rj/πj), which contradicts with the claim that d is the extreme scenario. Thus, the optimal objective valueztθ∗for (SPNtθ) corresponds to the worst second-stage cost increment by picking periods j in whichdj=Dju. □Note here that the similar analysis can be applied for the cases in whichdt∈Dtℓ,∑i=1NLiyitanddt∈∑i=1NUiyit,Dtu. Thus, we only need to consider T(N+2) knapsack problems to solve (SP), because there are T(N+2) combinations of t and θ. The dynamic programming algorithm for the knapsack problem can be adopted directly to solve each (SPNtθ).Now we consider obtaining the extreme demand d after solving the T(N+2) knapsack problems. For each combination of t and θ, let the optimal solution of (SPNtθ) be (stθ)∗ with the corresponding optimal objective valueztθ∗, andλtθ=πˆ0-∑j∈JπjDju-Djℓsjtθ∗/πt.If λtθ⩽ (Uθ−Lθ)yθt, letzˆtθ=ztθ∗and (t,θ) be a candidate to generate the extreme demand d. Otherwise, letzˆtθ=0, which implies that in the extreme scenario, dtis not in the θth interval. Let(t∗,θ∗)=argmaxt∈T,θ=0,1,…,N,N+1{zˆtθ}.Then, based on (SPNtθ), we can observe ifμ⩾zt∗θ∗∗+∑t≠t∗gtyt,Dtℓ+gt∗yt∗,λt∗θ∗+∑i=θ∗NLiyit∗+∑i=1θ∗-1Uiyit∗, the solution is feasible. Otherwise, we can construct the extreme demand d as follows:dt∗=λt∗θ∗+∑i=θ∗NLiyit∗+∑i=1θ∗-1Uiyit∗;dt=Dtℓ+Dtu-Dtℓstt∗θ∗,t≠t∗.Based on the fact that the knapsack problem can be solved inO(Tπ¯0)time (Toth, 1980), we have thatProposition 3The separation problem (SP) can be solved in pseudo-polynomial timeO(T2π¯0N).In this section, we develop solution methods to solve the general two-stage network constrained robust unit commitment problem (NC-RUC). We develop solution approaches that can provide exact and near-optimal solutions, respectively. Given a first-stage decision variable y, let ω(y) represent the optimal value function for the second-stage problem of (NC-RUC). By dualizing the constraints inX(y,d), we have(25)ω(y)=maxγ,η,τ,ρ,d,ξ,ζ∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈NmLimyitmγitm+-Uimyitmγitm-+∑m=1Mdmtηt+∑m=1M∑i∈Nmfyitm,ξitm,ζitm+∑(i,j)∈A∑m=1MKijmdmtτij,t+-Kijmdmtτij,t--∑(i,j)∈ACijτij,t++τij,t-+∑m=1M∑i∈Nm∑p=1Pyitmαitmpρitmp(26)(SUB)s.t.γitm+-γitm-+ηt+ξi(t+1)m-ξi(t)m+ζitm-ζi(t+1)m-∑p=1Pβitmpρitmp+∑(i,j)∈AKijmτij,t+-Kijmτij,t-=0,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t(27)∑p=1Pρitmp=1∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t(28)Dmtℓ⩽dmt⩽Dmtu∀m∈E,∀t(29)∑m=1Mπmtdmt⩽π¯t,∀t(30)∑m=1M∑t=1Tπmtdmt⩽π¯0(31)γitm+,γitm-,τij,t+,τij,t-,ξitm,ζitm,ρitmp⩾0,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀p∈P,∀(i,j)∈A,∀t,wherefyitm,ξitm,ζitm=-ξitm2-yi(t-1)m-yitmV‾im-ξitm1+yi(t-1)m-yitmVim-ζitm2-yi(t-1)m-yitmB‾im-ζitm1-yi(t-1)m+yitmBim,and the decision variablesγitm±,ξitm,ζitm, ηt,τij,t±andρitmpare the dual variables for constraints (6)–(11). We observe that (SUB) is a bilinear program with products of (η,τ) and d in the objective function, and thus NP-hard under general data settings (e.g.,∑m=1MπmtDmtu>π¯t).In this section, we develop optimality and feasibility cuts and provide separation schemes embedded in a Benders’ decomposition framework to solve (NC-RUC). For the Benders’ decomposition framework, we can solve the following master program iteratively by adding new constraints to cut off infeasible or non-optimal solutions:(32)zM=miny,u,v∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈NmSimuitm+Wimvitm+ω(y)(Master)s.t.∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈Nmσitmsyitm⩽κs,s=1,…,S,(33)ω(y)-∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈Nmσˆitmryitm⩾κˆr,r=1,…,R,(1)–(4),yitm,uitm,vitm∈{0,1},∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t,where constraints (32) represent the selected feasibility cuts added to the master problem, while constraints (33) represent the optimality cuts.Optimality cuts: From (SUB), we observe that for a given first-stage decision variable y,(34)ω(y)⩾∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈NmLimyitmγitm+-Uimyitmγitm-+∑m=1Mdmtηt+∑m=1M∑i∈Nmfyitm,ξitm,ζitm+∑(i,j)∈A∑m=1MKijmdmtτij,t+-Kijmdmtτij,t--∑(i,j)∈ACijτij,t++τij,t-+∑m=1M∑i∈Nm∑p=1P(yitmαitmpρitmp)for any feasible (γ,η,τ,ξ,ζ,ρ,d). Thus, cut (34) is valid for (Master).Feasibility cuts: To check the feasibility of given y, we apply the Benders’ method as described in Nemhauser and Wolsey (1988) and formulate the following feasibility checking program (FEA) by adding slacks in the second-stage problem of (NC-RUC):ωf(y)=minp,q,r,s⩾0∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈Nmpitm++pitm-+qitm++qitm-+rt++rt-+∑(i,j)∈Asij,t++sij,t-s.t.Limyitm⩽xitm+pitm+,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈Tγitm+xitm-pitm-⩽Uimyitm,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈Tγitm-xitm-xi(t-1)m-qitm+⩽2-yi(t-1)m-yitmV‾im+1+yi(t-1)m-yitmVim,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈Tξitmxi(t-1)m-xitm-qitm-⩽2-yi(t-1)m-yitmB‾im+1-yi(t-1)m+yitmBim,∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀t∈Tζitm∑m=1M∑i∈Nmxitm+rt+-rt-=∑m=1Mdmt,∀t∈T(ηt)-Cij⩽∑m=1MKijm∑n∈Nmxntm-dmt+sij,t+,∀(i,j)∈A,∀t∈Tτij,t+∑n∈Nmxntm-dmt-sij,t-⩽Cij,∀(i,j)∈A,∀t∈Tτij,t-wherepitm±,qitm±,rt±,sij,t±represent the slacks, andγitm±,ξitm,ζitm, ηtandτij,t±are the dual variables associated with the corresponding constraints. It is clear that if ωf(y)=0, then y is feasible for the given d. Otherwise, if ωf(y)>0, we can take the dual of (FEA) and generate a feasibility cut in the following form∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈Nm(Limyitmγitm+-Uimyitmγitm-+f(yitm,ξitm,ζitm))+∑m=1Mdmtηt+∑(i,j)∈A∑m=1MKijmdmt-Cijτij,t+-∑m=1MKijmdmt+Cijτij,t-⩽0,whereγitm±,ξitm,ζitm, ηtandτij,t±are the elements in the dual optimal solution to (FEA) and dmtis given for solving (FEA). We can then add the cut to (Master) to cut off the infeasible y.Exact separation approach: To obtain an exact separation, we need to solve the subproblem (SUB) into optimality. In the following, we show how we can solve the bilinear subproblem by solving a mixed-integer linear program. First, we can observe that the optimal solution for (NC-RUC) satisfies the following condition.Proposition 4There exists an optimal solution (γ∗,η∗,τ∗,ξ∗,ζ∗,ρ∗,d∗) to (SUB) that satisfies the following condition: For each time period t,dmt∗=DmtuorDmtℓ, except at most one bus in whichdmt∗∈Dmtℓ,Dmtuto make the constraint∑m=1Mπmtdmt⩽π¯ttight, or to make the constraint∑m=1M∑t=1Tπmtdmt⩽π¯0tight.We note that (SUB) maximizes a bilinear function over a polyhedron, where the linear constraints of (γ,η,τ,ξ,ζ,ρ) and those of d are disjoint. Hence, there exists an optimal solution (γ∗,η∗,τ∗,ξ∗,ζ∗,ρ∗,d∗) to (SUB) such that d∗ is an extreme point of the polyhedron represented by the constraints of d, i.e.,D. If this is not the case, we can fix (γ∗,η∗,τ∗,ξ∗,ζ∗,ρ∗) and solve (SUB), which, after optimized, gives us an extreme point d∗ ofD. Besides, based on the problem structure, it is easy to check that d∗ is an extreme point ofDif and only if d∗ satisfies the condition in the above claim. □Based on Proposition 4, as an extreme point, the demand in each bus at each time period will make: (1) lower or upper bound constraint tight, or (2) inequalities (29) tight, or (3) inequality (30) tight. Then, we let binary decision variablezmtu=1representing thatdmt∗=Dmtu, binary decision variablezmtf=1ifdmt∗∈Dmtℓ,Dmtuand it makes the corresponding inequality (29) tight, and binary decision variablezmtg=1ifdmt∗∈Dmtℓ,Dmtuand it makes the corresponding inequality (30) tight. In addition, we let binary decision variable zt=1 if the corresponding inequality (29) is tight. We can observe the following constraints hold:(35)zmtu+zmtf+zmtg⩽1,∀m∈E,∀t,(36)∑m=1Mzmtf⩽1,∀t,∑m=1M∑t=1Tzmtg⩽1,(37)zt=∑m=1Mzmtf,∀t,zmtg+zt⩽1,∀m∈E,∀t,where (35) indicates that the demand in each bus at each time period will play at most one role, (36) indicates that, at each time period t, at most one bus in which the demand plays the role to make the corresponding inequality (29) tight, and at most one bus at a particular time period in which the demand plays the role to make (30) tight. To avoid duplicated calculation, (37) indicates that if the demand for a bus in time period t is used to make (30) tight, then no bus in time period t will be considered to make (29) tight. Then, we can observe the following proposition holds.Proposition 5The exact separation for (NC-RUC) exists by reformulating the bilinear subproblem shown in(25)as a mixed-integer linear program, and obtaining the optimal solution of the corresponding reformulation.The detailed proof and the reformulation process are described in Appendix A. □Heuristic separation approach: It is challenging to use the exact separation approach to solve large size instances, due to a large amount of integer decision variables. To solve large-scale problems, we propose a heuristic approach that can solve the problem quickly. We first write down the following two linear programs, generated by fixing γ, η, τ, ρ, ξ, ζ and d in (SUB), respectively.maxγ,η,τ,ρ,ξ,ζ∑t=1T∑m=1M∑i∈Nm(Limyitmγitm+-Uimyitmγitm-)+∑m=1Mdmtηt+∑(i,j)∈A∑m=1MKijmdmt-Cijτij,t+-∑m=1MKijmdmt+Cijτij,t-(SUB1)+∑m=1M∑i∈Nm∑p=1Pyitmαitmpρitmp+∑m=1M∑i∈Nmfyitm,ξitm,ζitms.t.(26)and(27),γitm+,γitm-,τij,t+,τij,t-,ξitm,ζitm,ρitmp⩾0∀m∈E,∀i∈Nm,∀p,∀(i,j)∈A,∀t;maxd∑t=1T∑m=1Mηt+∑(i,j)∈AKijmτij,t+-τij,t-dmt+∑m=1M∑i∈NmLimyitmγitm+-Uimyitmγitm-(SUB2)-∑(i,j)∈A(Cijτij,t-+Cijτij,t+)+∑m=1M∑i∈Nm∑p=1P(yitmαitmpρitmp)+∑m=1M∑i∈Nmf(yitm,ξitm,ζitm)s.t.(28)–(30).In our heuristic approach, we follow the alternating method described in Konno (1976). We fix one set of variables and optimize the other set. Then we alternate until the objective value converges. For instance, this bilinear heuristic to generate an optimality cut for a given feasible solution y and ω(y) to (Master) can be described as follows:Step 1:Pick an extreme point d ofD;Solve (SUB1), and store the optimal objective value ω1(y,d);Solve (SUB2), and store the optimal objective value ω2(y,γ,η,τ,ρ,ξ,ζ);If ω2(y,γ,η,τ,ρ,ξ,ζ)>ω1(y,d), go to Step 2, otherwise go to Step 5;If ω2(y,γ,η,τ,ρ,ξ,ζ)>ω(y), generate the corresponding optimality cut (34), and add the cut to (Master).The similar approach can be applied to get feasible cuts. This approach is experimentally shown to converge to optimality for a bilinear program with a small optimality gap (less than 0.05%) (Ahmed and Guan, 2005).In this subsection, we construct lower and upper bounds of the optimal objective value of (NC-RUC), i.e., zR. In the separation scheme, we track these bounds to estimate the solution quality. First, it is easy to observe that if we fix d to be any point inDand solve the corresponding deterministic model (denote the corresponding objective value as zUC), then zUC⩽zR, providing a lower bound for zR. Besides, our heuristic separation approach can provide a lower bound.Proposition 6The objective value obtained by our heuristic separation approach provides a lower bound for the optimal objective value of (NC-RUC).The conclusion immediately follows from the fact that heuristic separation approach cannot guarantee to obtain an optimal solution for the subproblem. □Second, we can obtain a statistical upper bound U by fixing the first-stage decision and conducting Monte Carlo simulation for the second-stage problem of (NC-RUC). Suppose that we have obtained a first-stage decisiony¯. To obtain U, we first fixy=y¯in (NC-RUC), and then generate random large size demands to evaluate the performance of the robust optimal solution and record the corresponding cost. Finally, we assign the largest cost to U.Proposition 7Given a feasible solution to (NC-RUC), the statistical upper bound U converges to an upper bound of zRalmost surely and exponentially fast.We let H(d) be the optimal objective value for (SUB1) corresponding to a givend∈Dandy¯be the given feasible first-stage solution to (NC-RUC). It can be observed from established duality theory that H(d) is a continuous (convex) function of d. Letd∗∈Drepresent the maximal point, i.e.,H(d∗)=maxd∈DH(d), and suppose that we are sampling from the regionDaccording to a continuous probability distribution P with a positive density function onD(e.g., P can be a truncated normal distribution onD).For any ∊>0, we define δ=P(H(d)>H(d∗)−∊). Since H(d) is continuous, the constant δ>0. Now suppose that we take a series of independent samples {dn:n⩾1}, and letH‾Nrepresent the largest objective value obtained from the first N samples, i.e.,H‾N=maxn=1,…,NH(dn). ThenP(H‾N>H(d∗)-∊)=1-P(H‾N⩽H(d∗)-∊)=1-P(maxn=1,…,NH(dn)⩽H(d∗)-∊)=1-Πn=1,…,NP(H(dn)⩽H(d∗)-∊)=1-(1-δ)N.Hence,H‾Nconverges exponentially fast to H(d∗) in terms of probability. Furthermore, since∑N=1∞P(|H‾N-H(d∗)|>∊)=∑N=1∞(1-δ)N<∞,the conclusion thatH‾Nconverges to H(d∗) almost surely follows from Borel-Cantelli theorem. Now suppose that we denotec(y¯)as the unit commitment cost associated with the first-stage problem of (NC-RUC), thenc(y¯)+H(d∗)⩾zRsincey¯is a feasible solution to (NC-RUC). In other words,c(y¯)+H(d∗)is an upper bound of the optimal objective value of (NC-RUC). Therefore, by assigningc(y¯)+H‾Nto U, we have proved that the statistical upper bound U converges to an upper bound of zR almost surely and exponentially fast. □We present numerical experiments of the proposed algorithms in Sections 3 and 4. First, we conduct both the exact and heuristic separation approaches to solve (NC-RUC) on a small power grid. We compare the two approaches in terms of optimality and computational time on varying parameter settings, whose results are reported and analyzed in Section 5.1. Second, we conduct both nominal and robust optimization approaches on a large power grid, namely an IEEE 118-bus system, and compare the nominal and robust optimal solutions in terms of the worst-case performance, whose results are reported and analyzed in Section 5.2. All the experiments were implemented using CPLEX 12.1, at Intel Quad Core 2.40GHz with 8GB memory.In this subsection, we report and analyze the computational results on a small power grid containing 16 buses, 10 generators and 20 transmission lines. This power grid is a sub-network of the IEEE 118-bus system, and we conduct both exact and heuristic separation approaches to solve (NC-RUC) on this power grid with a time horizon T=24h. In this experiment, we relax the ramp-rate limit constraints and the overall budget constraint in the uncertainty set definition. In this relaxation, we can decompose the second-stage problem of (NC-RUC) into several subprograms in which each corresponds to a specific time period, and therefore significantly increase the computational efficiency. For the uncertainty set definition, we letDmtℓ=0.9D‾mt,Dmtu=(1+UB%)D‾mt, πmt=1, andπ¯t=(1+Budget%)∑m=1MD‾mt. We allow UB% and Budget% to vary from 0% to 20% in this experiment. Note that when Budget%>UB%, the restriction of the total demand is actually relaxed, and thus the computational results are the same as the case Budget%=UB%. Besides, since the demand changes as time goes by within 24h, we assume that for each bus m its nominal demandD‾mtchanges in accordance with the trend shown in Fig. 1, which is given by the statistics from a US deregulated energy market. In addition, in the experiment, we use a four-piece piecewise linear approximation for the convex fuel cost function.The computational results on the small power grid are summarized in Table 1, where the Benders’ decomposition algorithm based on exact and heuristic approaches are compared in terms of optimal objective value and computational time. We observe that our bilinear approach converges to optimality with a small gap (less than 0.05% in all the settings) in a reasonable and much shorter time than the exact separation approach does. Theoretically, with the size of power grid increasing, the computational complexity of the exact separation approach grows exponentially. Hence, it can become computationally intractable for us to employ it in larger power grids. On the other hand, our bilinear separation approach is stable in computational complexity with a power grid of increasing size, and we can use the lower and upper bounds discussed in Section 4.3 to verify its solution quality. This observation motivates us to implement the heuristic separation approach on the IEEE 118-bus system discussed in Section 5.2.In this subsection, we report and analyze the computational results on the IEEE 118-bus system. This power grid is based on a U.S. midwest power grid, and contains 118 buses, 33 generators and 186 transmission lines. The data set describing this power system is available online at http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/. We follow the uncertainty set definition in Section 5.1, and additionally we define that the overall budget amountπ¯0=(1+Overall%)∑t=1T∑m=1MD‾mt, the ramp-up and ramp-down rate limits are 50% of the maximum electricity output of each generator i at each bus m, and the nominal demand follows the pattern illustrated in Fig. 1. Please note that this pattern is used only for numerical testing purposes, and system operators can adjust this pattern according to their circumstances (e.g., weather condition, season, type of day, etc.).The computational results on the IEEE 118-bus system are summarized in Tables 2,3. In this experiment, we have accomplished two groups of sensitivity analyses to see the impact of uncertainty set variation on the worst-case performance of robust and nominal optimal solutions. First, we adjust UB% and Budget% simultaneously (and fix Overall%=18%), and display the computational results in Table 2. Second, we adjust Overall% and Budget% simultaneously (and fix UB%=20%), and display the corresponding results in Table 3. For each combination, the robust optimal solution is obtained by applying the proposed bilinear approach, and the nominal optimal solution is obtained by solving the nominal model with R%=max{10%,min{UB%,Budget%}}, which makes R% in the nominal model at levels commensurate with the corresponding uncertainty sets in the robust model. In Tables 2,3, we provide the following lower and upper bounds:(1)Lower bound L1 is obtained by relaxing the transmission capacity and ramp-rate limits (i.e., solving RUC), in which case we can employ the algorithm presented in Section 3.Lower bound L2 is obtained by using our bilinear heuristic separation approach to solve (NC-RUC).Upper bound U is obtained by using Monte Carlo simulation discussed in Section 4.3. In the experiment, the random demand at each bus m in time period t is generated from a truncated normal distribution with meanDmtu+Dmtℓ/2and standard deviationDmtu-Dmtℓ/4in the intervalDmtℓ,Dmtu. Additionally, the size of samples is 200,000.Upper bound WC represents the worst-case value, obtained by solving (NC-RUC) with the first-stage decision fixed to be the optimal solution of the nominal problem. In other words, we first solve the deterministic model with demands chosen to be their nominal values, and then solve (NC-RUC) with its first-stage decision fixed at the nominal optimal solution. Thus, WC estimates how the nominal optimal solution performs under the worst-case scenario. In the experiments we found that the nominal optimal solutions are infeasible to (NC-RUC) for all the instances except those with UB%⩽5%. This observation indicates that it would be risky to make unit commitment decisions based only on the nominal demand information. To compare the performance between these solutions, we introduce a linear penalty cost function for any unsatisfied demands or transmission capacity/ramp-rate limit violations. The unit penalty cost ϱtis set 20% higher than the sum of the maximal unit fuel cost and the maximal start-up cost, i.e.,(38)ϱt=1.2×maxm=1,2,…,Mmaxi∈NmSim+maxm=1,2,…,Mmaxi∈NmβitmP,∀t∈T.Note here that this value is also used for Rtand Ptto calculate L1.Correspondingly, we calculate the following gaps based on the lower and upper bounds:(1)TC Gap=(L2−L1)/L1×100%. It estimates the difference between the objective value of the simplified unit commitment problem without considering the transmission capacity and ramp-rate limit constraints (i.e., the case studied in Section 3) and the one of the general network constrained robust unit commitment problem (NC-RUC) (i.e., the case studied in Section 4).Opt. Gap=(U−L2)/L2×100%. It estimates the optimality gap of our bilinear heuristic approach.WC Gap=(WC−U)/U×100%. It estimates the difference between the performance of the robust optimal solution and the nominal optimal solution, when the linear penalty cost function is introduced in calculating WC.From Table 2, we first observe that statistically our bilinear heuristic approach provides feasible solutions for all the instances with UB%∈[5,20]. We can observe from the table that the optimality gap of our bilinear heuristic approach is less than 0.2% for all the instances. Meanwhile, we can observe that the computational time for the algorithm is less than 300s for any instance. This result shows that our bilinear heuristic approach can provide a solution that is very close to the optimal solution, within a short time. Accordingly, it is sufficient to apply our bilinear heuristic approach to solve large size problems, in order to obtain near-optimal solutions.Then, from the WC Gap information, we can observe that when the demand fluctuation is very restrictive (e.g., UB%⩽5% and Budget%⩽5%), the WC Gap is small; and with UB% and Budget% increasing, the WC gap grows fast. Note that the nominal optimal solutions are infeasible for most of the instances, and we have introduced a linear penalty cost function, with the unit penalty cost ϱ defined in (38), to make up for any unsatisfied demand, transmission line overload, or ramp-rate limit violation. In this sense, the WC gaps measure the relative infeasibility of the nominal optimal solution in different scenarios. In view of that, we can claim that (1) the spinning reserve constraints deal well with demand fluctuation when it is restrictive and fail afterwards, and (2) the extent of infeasibility (and hence the corresponding making up costs) of the nominal optimal solution grows fast as demand fluctuation increases.Third, we can observe from Table 2 that the TC Gaps are smaller than 4% for all the instances. It indicates that we can utilize the solution approach for (RUC) described in Section 3 to provide a good approximation on the total cost for the general network constrained robust unit commitment problem.Finally, our computational results indicate that as the demand fluctuation increases, the corresponding objective value increases accordingly. For instance, the objective value increases by around 19.83% as the uncertainty set changes from UB%=5% and Budget%=2% (the corresponding objective value is $1,244,451) to UB%=20% and Budget%=20% (the corresponding objective value is $1,491,255).From Table 3, we first observe that our algorithm provides tight lower and upper bounds in a reasonable amount of time, with Opt. Gaps within 0.3% under all the settings.Second, we see that WC Gaps are considerable in all the instances, indicating that the nominal optimal solutions are highly infeasible.Third, by comparing the trends of WC values along rows and columns in Table 3, we can observe that both a growing Budget% and a growing Overall% play important roles in making the nominal optimal solution infeasible. From the definition of the polyhedral uncertainty set used in this experiment, we know that Budget% (orπ¯t) defines the demand budget within each single period to control demand fluctuation at different locations in a given time unit, while Overall% (orπ¯0) defines the overall budget throughout all the periods to control demand fluctuation among different time periods. If Budget% is very large, then Overall% plays a more important role (e.g., the WC values in the last row in Table 3); and if Overall% is very large, then Budget% plays a more important role (e.g., the WC values in the last column Table 3). Otherwise, both play important roles (e.g., the WC values in the other rows and columns). With the introduction of demand-responsive pricing schemes, the demand fluctuation boosts in power grids; and the robust methods are hence getting more and more meaningful and valuable.
