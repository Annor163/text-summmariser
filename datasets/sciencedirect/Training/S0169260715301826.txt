@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Background and objectiveIntegrative approaches for the study of biological systems have gained popularity in the realm of statistical genomics. For example, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has applied integrative clustering methodologies to various cancer types to determine molecular subtypes within a given cancer histology. In order to adequately compare integrative or “systems-biology”-type methods, realistic and related datasets are needed to assess the methods. This involves simulating multiple types of ‘omic data with realistic correlation between features of the same type (e.g., gene expression for genes in a pathway) and across data types (e.g., “gene silencing” involving DNA methylation and gene expression).MethodsWe present the software application tool InterSIM for simulating multiple interrelated data types with realistic intra- and inter-relationships based on the DNA methylation, mRNA gene expression, and protein expression from the TCGA ovarian cancer study.ResultsThe resulting simulated datasets can be used to assess and compare the operating characteristics of newly developed integrative bioinformatics methods to existing methods. Application of InterSIM is presented with an example of heatmaps of the simulated datasets.ConclusionsInterSIM allows researchers to evaluate and test new integrative methods with realistically simulated interrelated genomic datasets. The software tool InterSIM is implemented in R and is freely available from CRAN.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Identification of molecular subtypes of cancer using high throughput molecular data has been frequently accomplished through the use of clustering [1,2]. Clustering involves the grouping of objects across a disjoint set of classes such that objects within the same class are more similar to one another as compared to the objects in different classes. A large number of clustering methods are available that use a single data type; such as, hierarchical, k-means [3], and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [4]. In addition to these methods, a few integrative clustering methods have been proposed that utilizes information from multiple data types collected on the same set of samples including: iCluster[5], integrative NMF [6], and mixture model based integrative clustering [7]. A summary of the above mentioned methods can be found in Chalise et al. [8]. However, in order to adequately assess such integrative methods, realistic and interrelated datasets are needed. InterSIM bridges this gap by simulating complex interrelated realistic genomic datasets.Although clustering methods can be used to classify either genes or subjects, the proposed simulation tool focuses on clustering of subjects with the goal of identifying molecular subtypes of disease. In developing the simulation tool, we focused on generating three data types, DNA methylation, mRNA gene expression, and protein expression, on a set of samples with realistic correlation between and within data types. Here are a few examples of the types of relationships we included in the simulation of the data: CpG sites within the same CpG-island would have strong positive correlation, high methylation for a CpG-island upstream of a gene would result in lower mRNA expression or “gene silencing”, and higher mRNA gene expression is likely to result in higher downstream protein expression [9]. Such intra- and inter-feature relationships among the data types were based on real data collected on ovarian cancer tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
