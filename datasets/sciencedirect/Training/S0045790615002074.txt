@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Systematic Random code reconstruct the original message with zero extra coded symbols if the first k coded symbols are received intact.Reconstruct the original message with 99.9% success probability using extra ten overhead symbols.In channels of low erasure probability, systematic Random code outperforms Random code in term of lesser extra coded symbols and decoding steps to achieve complete decoding.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we propose a systematic rateless erasure code, namely systematic Random (SYSR) code based on Random code for short messages transmission. Given a message of k symbols, the sender will first send the message to the receiver as Part I coded symbols. The rest of coded symbols starting fromk+1th onwards are termed as Part II coded symbols and they are generated by adding the message symbols randomly (XOR operation). The receiver reconstructs the original message instantly if all the Part I coded symbols are received intact. Otherwise, the receiver reconstructs the original message from anyk+10coded symbols of Part I and II with high probability of complete decoding (PCD), i.e. 99.9% success probability. Though SYSR code inherits the high decoding complexity of Random code, i.e.O(k3), both analysis and simulation results show that SYSR code achieves better PCD and fewer decoding steps than Random code.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The rateless erasure code (also known as fountain code) is a class of erasure code, where the sender generates potentially infinite number of coded symbols from a message of k symbols. Upon receiving k1+∊coded symbols, the receiver reconstructs the original message with high probability of complete decoding (PCD), i.e. 99.9% success probability, where ∊ denotes the decoding inefficiency and∊⩾0.To improve the decoding performance, the systematic rateless erasure code uses the k symbols of the original message as the first part of the coded symbols and the rest are generated using a sequence of bit operations on the original message. Then, the receiver reconstructs the original message instantly if the first k coded symbols are received intact. In case of any lost symbols, the receiver will reconstruct the original message from the subsequent coded symbols.Significant research effort has been channelled to study rateless erasure codes in data networks, such as the Internet [1,2], vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) [3,4], and delay-tolerant network (DTN) [5]. However, majority of the traffic in the Internet are short messages of less than 10 packets [6] and the VANET’s messages are normally in a few hundred bytes [7]. The state-of-the-art rateless erasure codes (e.g. Luby Transform (LT) code [8] and Raptor code [9]) are inappropriate in the aforementioned networks due to their inefficiency in sending short messages. For example, the decoding inefficiency, ∊ is as high as 15% for the messages of thousands symbols [10] and it increases to about 30% whenk=100[11]. Likewise, many non-systematic rateless erasure codes have been proposed for short messages transmission (cf. Section 2). These coding schemes require non-negligible decoding complexity even if all the coded symbols are received intact.In this paper, we propose a systematic rateless erasure code, namely systematic Random code (SYSR code) that is built on top of random matrix (a matrix of randomly distributed binary values). Like typical systematic rateless erasure code, a message of k symbols will form part of the encoded symbols (termed as Part I coded symbols) and the rest of coded symbols fromk+1th onwards (termed as Part II coded symbols) are generated by adding the k message symbols randomly, i.e. multiplying the random matrix with the message. Therefore, SYSR code is able to reconstruct the original message instantly if the Part I coded symbols are received intact. Otherwise, the original message can still be reconstructed with high PCD from anyk+10coded symbols of Part I and II with high PCD.Unlike the rateless erasure codes that reviewed in Section 2, the high PCD of SYSR code is invariant to message length and applicable to short messages e.g.k=10symbols. Since random matrix is a widely used mathematical framework for coding theory, it is unsurprising that SYSR code looks similar to the network coding scheme in [12] at first glance. However, we point out that SYSR code is an erasure code that involves only sender and receiver whereas the network coding involves multiple network nodes cooperating in the encoding and decoding processes.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The state-of-the-art rateless erasure codes and the properties of Random matrix to achieve full rank are discussed in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. Then, we propose SYSR code that is built on top of random matrix in Section 4 and the decoding process will be explained with an example. The PCD and decoding algorithm of SYSR code is analysed in Section 5 and the corresponding numerical results are presented in Section 6 alongside result with Random code and Stepping-Random (SR) code. Finally, we draw the conclusion in Section 7.
