@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
This paper proposes a new approach for training support vector machines with a bone age determination system.The proposed approach is a combination of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs).The performance and accuracy of the proposed PSO–SVM algorithm are examined on a bone age data set.The results obtained by PSO–SVM show that PSO–SVM is more effective than the previous study based on conventional SVM.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The evaluation of bone development is a complex and time-consuming task for the physicians since it may cause intraobserver and interobserver differences. In this study, we present a new training algorithm for support vector machines in order to determine the bone age in young children from newborn to 6 years old. By the new algorithm, we aimed to assist the radiologists so as to eliminate the disadvantages of the methods used in bone age determination. To achieve this purpose, primarily feature extraction procedure was performed to the left hand wrist X-ray images by using image processing techniques and the features related with the carpal bones and distal epiphysis of radius bone were obtained. Then these features were used for the input arguments of the classifier. In the classification process, a new training algorithm for support vector machines was proposed by using particle swarm optimization. When training support vector machines, particle swarm optimization was used for generating a new training instance which will represent the whole training set of the related class by using the training set. Finally, these new instances were used as the support vectors and classification process was carried out by using these new instances. The performance of the proposed method was compared with the naive Bayes, k-nearest neighborhood, support vector machines and C4.5 algorithms. As a result, it was determined that the proposed method was found successful than the other methods for bone age determination with a classification performance of 74.87%.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
There are some references which describe the situations of chronological age of an individual like height, bone maturity and dental age. Among these, bone age measurement has a significant role because of its practicability and reliability in diagnosing hereditary diseases and growth disorder [1]. Bone age is determined by radiological examinations of the left hand wrist, and following this it is compared with chronological age. The conflict between these two values indicates an abnormality on development process of the skeleton [2].There are two main methods used for the determination of the bone age. The first of these methods is the Greulich–Pyle (GP) method which is an atlas matching method [3]. This method is based on the visual comparison of the X-ray of left hand wrist with the X-ray samples grouped in an atlas depending on their sex and age [4]. Second most used method determining the bone age is the Tanner–Whitehouse (TW2) based on detailed analysis of the bones of the left hand [5]. The TW2 method uses a detailed analysis of individual bones of interest leading to the determination of their membership to one of several stages. Scores are derived from each bone stage and summed to compute the assessment [6].The bone age determination process is a complex and time consuming task depending on the intraobserver and interobserver differences. So there is a need of a more accurate, objective, and reproducible technique for assessing skeletal maturity. In this context, in the literature, there are several studies on computer aided bone age determination using neural network based system [1], fuzzy based system [5,7,8], kNN based system [1], support vector regression based system [9]. Additionally, in 2013, Harmsen et al. [10] presented a method using support vector machine classification based on correlation prototypes. They extracted 14 epiphyseal regions from the radiographs, and for each region, retained image features using the image retrieval in medical application framework. For this purpose, they combined a support vector machine with cross correlation to a prototype image for each class. These prototypes were obtained through choosing one random hand per class. They used 1097 hand radiographs of age ranging between 0 and 19 years. The mean error in age prediction was 1.0 and 0.83 years for 5-NN and SVM, respectively. Accuracies of nominal and real valued SVM based on six prominent regions were 91.57% and 96.16%, respectively, for accepting about two year age range. In 2013, Güraksın et al. [11] presented a method based on support vector machine classification for bone age determination. In the mentioned study, the image processing procedure was primarily applied on the left hand-wrist X-ray images of children whose ages were between 0 and 6 from different ethnic groups, and totally nine features corresponding to the carpal bones and distal epiphysis of the radius bone with the some physiological attributes of the children were obtained. Then by using gain ratio, the best six features were used for the classification process. Later on, using the obtained features, bone age determination process was done by the help of the algorithms which were SVM, NB, kNN and C4.5, and the performances of the methods used for the determination process were compared to each other. As a result, the highest success rate was achieved by SVM with the classification performance of 72.82%. With the one year age range tolerance taken into consideration, the proposed bone age determination system was provided an accuracy with 96.41%.In the literature, PSO was generally used with SVM for feature selection and extraction [12–14], parameter optimization of SVM [15–19] and multi-class classification in SVM [20]. In this study, a new training algorithm for SVM was proposed by using PSO. Unlike the other studies in the literature, we generated a new training instance which represents the whole training set of the related class by using PSO. These new instances of the classes were generated from the training set of the related classes. By the help of PSO, the best acting instance was generated for the training of the classes. Thereby, only one instance was used to train the SVM for the related class. While the classification process is limited by the support vectors that are determined from the training samples in the traditional SVM, the proposed method created one sample for each class as support vector by using PSO algorithm in order to prevent this restriction. As a result, our proposed method showed that it is sufficient for bone age determination in young children between the ages of 0 and 6.
