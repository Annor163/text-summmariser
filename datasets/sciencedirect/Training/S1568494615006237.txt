@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The fixed charge problem is a special type of nonlinear programming problem which forms the basis of many industry problems wherein a charge is associated with performing an activity. In real world situations, the information provided by the decision maker regarding the coefficients of the objective functions may not be of a precise nature. This paper aims to describe a solution algorithm for solving such a fixed charge problem having multiple fractional objective functions which are all of a fuzzy nature. The enumerative technique developed not only finds the set of efficient solutions but also a corresponding fuzzy solution, enabling the decision maker to operate in the range obtained. A real life numerical example in the context of the ship routing problem is presented to illustrate the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The fixed charge problem is one of the interesting applications of the mixed integer programming problem having a practical use both in business and industry and was initialized by Hirsch and Dantzig in 1968 [13]. In this nonlinear programming problem, there is a cost associated with performing an activity at a nonzero level which does not depend on the level of the activity. The existence of these fixed charges associated with the activities in the objective function produce a nonlinear programming problem. The fixed charges may be expressed as a measure other than cost, such as the setup time of getting a machine into service. Up to now, it has been widely applied in many decision-making and optimization problems like the warehouse or plant location decisions, wherein there is a charge associated with opening the facility; in transportation problems where there are fixed charges for transporting goods between supply points and demand points.Only a few exact methods for solving it are present in literature. Based on the branch and bound method, Steinberg [20] provided an exact method for small problems. On the other hand, various approximate solution methods have been developed by Cooper [7], Murty [18], Cooper and Drebes [8], Walker [21] based on adjacent extreme point algorithms. In more recent times, the emphasis has shifted to the study of the fixed cost transportation problem which is mainly solved by ranking of the extreme points and the branch and bound method. This is because the problem reduces to that of minimising a concave function over a bounded convex set. The resulting optimum is taken at one or more of the extreme points of the feasible region; but for a non-degenerate problem with positive fixed costs, every extreme point of the feasible region is a local minimum. In [1], Adlakha and Kowalski use the Balinski approximation method introduced for the fixed charge transportation problem and apply the same for solving the fixed charge problem.A natural generalization of the linear objective function is a problem having a linear fractional (or hyperbolic) objective function, giving rise to the fractional programming problem which involves the optimization of one or several ratios of functions subject to some constraints [5,19]. Such objectives arise in economical models when the goal is to optimize profit per unit investment type functions. In some applications where the efficiency of a system is to be optimized, the efficiency may be characterized by a ratio of technical and/or economical terms which leads to a fractional program. In 1971, Almogy and Levin [2] introduced the fractional fixed charge problem which arises in numerous applications, where the measure of economic performance is the time rate of earnings or profit (equivalent to an interest rate on capital investment). They discussed its application to the ship routing problem by optimizing the profit per unit time over a given route. The criteria then for choosing a route is that the resulting profit per unit time exceeds the fixed cost per unit time at the port from where all routes originate and terminate. Recent applications of the fixed charge problem having the dual concept of fixed and variable cost have been seen in the network design flow problems [12] and the facility location problems [10]. Also, Arora [3] developed a systematic extreme point enumeration technique, which provides an exact solution to the fixed charge problem.In the fixed charge problem though, the parameters in the objective are supplied according to the decision makers’ requirements, who in most cases is unable to provide this precise information. In such a case, we formulate them as fuzzy numbers, in other words the objective function can be fuzzified and a leverage is provided to the decision maker to operate. To the authors’ knowledge, no work has yet been done in developing a solution procedure for solving a multiobjective fixed charge problem with linear fractional objective functions having fuzzy parameters. In this paper we intend to provide the required algorithm and a fuzzy solution for the same. Preliminary concepts of fuzzy numbers are studied in Section 2. The problem under discussion is formulated, and related concepts of Pareto efficiency are defined in Section 3. The algorithm developed in Section 4 is supported by a real life numerical example in the context of the ship routing problem in Section 5.In this section we review some fundamentals of fuzzy numbers and ranking functions which will be used through the remainder of this paper. We shall use the most common definition of a fuzzy number given by Dubois and Prade [9].Fuzzy number. A fuzzy numberA˜is a convex normalized fuzzy set of the real lineℝsuch that:(i)∃ uniquex0∈ℝsuch thatμA˜(x0)=1, andμA˜is piecewise continuous.Triangular fuzzy number. A fuzzy numberA˜is a triangular fuzzy number if its membership functionμA˜is of the formμA˜(x)=x−ab−a,a≤x≤bx−cb−c,b≤x≤c0,otherwisewhere a, b and c are real numbers. It is denoted byA˜=(a,b,c).Let us denote the set of fuzzy numbers byF(ℝ). The basic arithmetic operations between two triangular fuzzy numbers are given below [15].LetA˜=(a,b,c),B˜=(x,y,z)∈F(ℝ), then(i)Addition:(A˜⊕B˜)=(a+x,b+y,c+z).Scalar multiplication:(k⊗A˜)=(ka,kb,kc)ifk>0(kc,kb,ka)ifk<0Multiplication:(A˜⊗B˜)=(min{ax,az,cx,cz},by,max{ax,az,cx,cz})Division:(A˜øB˜)=(min{a/x,a/z,c/x,c/z},b/y,max{a/x,a/z,c/x,c/z}).Non-negativity:A˜is said to be a non-negative triangular fuzzy number iff a≥0.Since two fuzzy numbers cannot be compared due to the absence of any linear ordering in the setF(ℝ), a simple concept of ranking functions is employed for such a comparison. A ranking function is a mappingR:F(ℝ)→ℝwhich maps each fuzzy number into a point on the real line where a natural order exists. Baas and Kwakernaak [4] are among the pioneers in this area. Several methods of ranking fuzzy subsets have been proposed and comparisons of these methods have been reported in [6,11]. In this paper we consider the ranking of triangular fuzzy numbers using the concept of total integral value given by Liou and Wang [17]. The left integral value is used to reflect the pessimistic viewpoint and the right integral value is used to reflect the optimistic viewpoint of the decision maker. A convex combination of the left and right integral values through an index of optimism [16] is called the total integral value. Here for a given level of priority α∈[0, 1], the total integral value of the triangular fuzzy numberA˜=(a,b,c)is taken to be the ranking function defined asR(A˜)=12[αc+b+(1−α)a]We can thus define orders onF(ℝ)as follows. LetA˜,B˜∈F(ℝ). Then,A˜≽B˜if and only ifR(A˜)≥R(B˜),A˜≻B˜if and only ifR(A˜)>R(B˜),A˜≈B˜if and only ifR(A˜)=R(B˜).Many problems of economics and logistics involve the planning of a large number of interdependent activities in as economical a way as possible. There exists an important class of nonlinear programming problems of the form(FCP)MinimizeΦ(X)=∑j=1nαjxj+βjδ(xj)subject to∑j=1naijxj=bi,i=1,2,…,mxj≥0,j=1,2,…,nwhere αj, βj, j={1, 2, …, n} are constants, andδ(u)=0,ifu=01,ifu>0This problem with a nonlinear objective function and linear constraints is called the Fixed Charge Problem (FCP) and the constants βjare the fixed charges associated with the jth activity. These fixed charges are incurred if a new activity is engaged in at a positive level, which leads to a new charge to be borne by the firm.The fractional fixed charge problem (FFCP) discussed by Almogy and Levin [2] is described as follows(FFCP)MinimizeZ(X)=∑j=1ncjxj+∑j=1nFj∑j=1ndjxj+∑j=1nfj+γ(1)subject to∑j=1naijxj=bi,i∈I=1,2,…,m(2)xj≥0,j∈J=1,2,…,nwhere γ is a constant. It is assumed that∑j=1ndjxj+∑j=1nfj+γ>0over the solution set. The numbers Fjand fj, j∈J are the fixed charges associated with the decision variable xjand are formulated in the following manner. If the quantity of the variable xjis less than a value Ajsay, then the fixed charge iskj1units. When the quantity exceeds or is equal to Aj, an additional fixed chargekj2is incurred. Then,Fj=total fixed charge associated with the variablexj=δ1kj1+δ2kj2whereδ1=1,if0<xj<Aj0,otherwiseandδ2=1,ifxj≥Aj0,otherwiseNote here that Fjis a step function and in this example it has two steps. In [2] it is established that the optimal solution of the fractional fixed charge problem occurs at an extreme point of the feasible region defined by (1) and (2).The mathematical model of the problem under consideration which is the multiobjective fractional fixed charge problem (FMCP) with fuzzy coefficients is(FMCP)MinimizeZ˜(X)=(Z˜1(X),Z˜2(X),…,Z˜p(X))subject to∑j=1naijxj=bi,i∈I={1,2,…,m}xj≥0,j∈J={1,2,…,n}where p is the number of objectives andZ˜r(X)=∑j=1nc˜rjxj+∑j=1nF˜rj∑j=1nd˜rjxj+∑j=1nf˜rj+γ˜r,r∈R={1,2,…,p}andF˜rj,f˜rj, r∈R, j∈J are the fuzzy fixed charges associated with the variable xj. It is further assumed that the fuzzy denominator∑j=1ndr˜jxj+∑j=1nfr˜j+γ˜ris positive over the solution set for all r∈R. For formulation of the fixed charges, assume that bothFr˜jandfr˜jhave l number of steps so that(3)F˜rj=∑k=1lδrjkG˜rjk,r∈R,j∈J(4)f˜rj=∑k=1lηrjkg˜rjk,r∈R,j∈J(5)whereδrjk=1,ifArjk−1<xj<Arjk0,otherwise(6)andηrjk=1,ifBrjk−1<xj<Brjk0,otherwiseHereArj1,Arj2,…,Arjl,Brj1,Brj2,…,Brjlare constants, where0=Arj1<Arj2<⋯<Arjl,0=Brj1<Brj2<⋯<BrjlandG˜rjk,g˜rjkare the fixed costs provided by the decision maker.LetS={X∈ℝn:AX=b,X≥0}be the set of feasible solutions of (FMCP). Using the concept of Liou and Wang's ranking function defined earlier, we first formulate the crisp problem corresponding to (FMCP) and then introduce the Pareto optimality concepts for the (FMCP) by extending the ordinary Pareto optimality definition.(MFCP)MinimizeR(Z˜(X))=(R(Z˜1(X)),R(Z˜2(X)),…,R(Z˜p(X)))subject toX∈SwhereR(Z˜r(X))=∑j=1nR(c˜rj)xj+∑j=1nR(F˜rj)∑j=1nR(d˜rj)xj+∑j=1nR(f˜rj)+R(γ˜r),r∈RR-efficient solution. X*∈S is said to be an R-efficient solution of (FMCP) if and only if there does not exist another X∈S such thatZ˜r(X)≼Z˜r(X*)for allr∈RandZ˜k(X)≺Z˜k(X*)for at least onek∈{1,2,…,p}.Also, the corresponding nondominated criterion vector or objective function value is(Z˜1(X*),Z˜2(X*),…,Z˜p(X*)). The following theorem establishes a relation between the efficient solutions of the fuzzy (FMCP) and the crisp (MFCP).Theorem 1Let X*∈S. Then X*is an R-efficient solution of (FMCP) if and only if X*is an efficient solution of (MFCP).ProofX* is an R-efficient solution of (FMCP) if and only if there does not exist another X∈S such thatZ˜r(X)≼Z˜r(X*)for allr∈RandZ˜k(X)≺Z˜k(X*)for at least onek∈{1,2,…,p}.By the definition of orders inF(ℝ), the above relations can be expressed as: X* is an R-efficient solution of (FMCP) if and only if there does not exist another X∈S such thatR(Z˜r(X))≤R(Z˜r(X*))for allr∈RandR(Z˜k(X))<R(Z˜k(X*))for at least onek∈{1,2,…,p}.This is equivalent to saying that X* is an efficient solution of the crisp problem (MFCP) defined above.Thus, there is a direct relationship between the R-efficient solutions of (FMCP) and the efficient solutions of (MFCP). Consider the problem (MFCP) with any one of its objective functions, say Z1 subject to the constraints to formulate (MFCP-Z1). Since the optimal solution of a single objective fractional fixed charge problem lies at an extreme point of its feasible region [2], it is suggested from this that, in order to find various efficient solutions of (MFCP), we should move from one extreme point to another extreme point of S. The following theorem shows how an optimal solution of (MFCP-Z1) obtained by the modified entry criterion described in the next section may be justified to be an efficient solution of (MFCP).Theorem 2In a nondominated p-tuple (Z1, Z2, …, Zp), Z1is the minimum value of the first objective function; also (Z2, Z3, …, Zp) is a nondominated (p−1)-tuple corresponding to the value Z1of the first objective.ProofSuppose that in a nondominated p-tuple (Z1, Z2, …, Zp) corresponding to an efficient solution X, Z1 is not the minimum value of the first objective function. Then, there exists another solutionXˆyielding valueZ1ˆof Z1 such thatZ1ˆ<Z1andZrˆ=Zr,r∈R′={2,3,…,p}i.e. (Z1, Z2, …, Zp) is dominated by(Z1ˆ,Z2ˆ,…,Zpˆ), which contradicts that (Z1, Z2, …, Zp) is a nondominated p-tuple. Hence, Z1 must be the minimum value of the first objective function.Next, suppose (Z2, Z3, …, Zp) is dominated by(Z2′,Z3′,…,Zp′), then there exists a solution X′ yielding a valueZr′such thatZr′<Zr, r∈R′={2, 3, …, p} andZ1′=Z1. Thus(Z1′,Z2′,…,Zp′)dominates (Z1, Z2, …, Zp); contradicting that (Z1, Z2, …, Zp) is a nondominated p-tuple. Therefore, (Z2, Z3, …, Zp) is a nondominated (p−1)-tuple with Z1 as the first objective.In 1965, Kanti Swarup [14] extended the simplex technique for the linear programming problem to propose a method for the solution of the linear fractional programming problem by starting with a basic feasible solution and stating the conditions under which the current objective function value can be improved. The major difference between the algorithm for solving the fractional programming problem and that used for the fractional fixed charge problem is that the latter uses a modified entry criterion. This modification is described below.In the fractional programming problem [14], if the optimality criterion – Δrj≤0 ∀j – is not satisfied; then the variable that enters the basis is chosen according tomaxj∉B{Δrj|Δrj>0,r∈R,j∈J}, where B is the current basis and Δrjis defined asΔrj=lr(Lrj−drj)−ηr(zrj−crj).HereLrj=∑i=1mdBriuij,zrj=∑i=1mcBriuijandlr=∑i=1mcBriXBi,ηr=∑i=1mdBriXBi+γrwhere uj=B−1aj, for every column ajof A not in B; and XBis the initial basic feasible solution. In other words, starting with a basic feasible solution, if there is a vector ajnot in the basis having Δrj>0, then there exists another basic feasible solution at which the value of the objective function can be improved.In order to incorporate the fixed charges occurring in the crisp fractional fixed charge problem which arise corresponding to the positive decision variables, we modify the variable Δrjand define it as follows,Δrj′=lr′(Lrj−drj)−ηr′(zrj−crj)wherelr′=∑i=1mcBriXBi+∑j=1nFrj,ηr′=∑i=1mdBriXBi+∑j=1nfrj+γr, andcBri=R(cBri˜),dBri=R(dBri˜),Frj=R(Frj˜),frj=R(frj˜),γr=R(γ˜r).Thus the method of Kanti Swarup has been further extended here for solving the fractional fixed charge problem; where if the optimality criterion is not satisfied, then the condition to choose the variable that enters the basis is modified as described above.Note. The process is bound to terminate in a finite number of steps since there are only a finite number of extreme points corresponding to basic feasible solutions. Also, in the absence of degeneracy, no basis can be repeated because the objective function value is improved at every step and two bases will always yield the same objective function value, while at the same time the optimal solution occurs at a basic feasible solution. The process shall terminate only when all Δrj≤0 for the columns of A not in B.We now present the algorithm to further elucidate the solution procedure.Step 1   Consider the multiobjective fractional fixed charge problem with fuzzy coefficients (FMCP). We first convert this fuzzy problem into the equivalent crisp multiobjective fractional fixed charge problem (MFCP) and then consider this (MFCP) with any one of the objective functions, say Z1.Step 2   In (MFCP-Z1), choose F1j=0, f1j=0 ∀j∈J and solve it in order to obtain an optimal solution, say X1=[XB0]′. Calculate (L1j−d1j) and (z1j−c1j)∀j∉B. Find the fixed costs ∑jF1jand ∑jf1jusing (3) and (4).Step 3   ComputeΔ1j′=l1′(L1j−d1j)−η1′(z1j−c1j). IfΔ1j′≤0, then X1 is an optimal solution of (MFCP-Z1). Then go to Step 5. Otherwise, go to Step 4.Step 4   Findmaxj∉B{Δ1j′|Δ1j′>0}. Suppose it is maximum for j = s, then enter xsinto the basis. Find the new basic feasible solution and repeat Step 3.Step 5   This is the first efficient solution to (MFCP). The corresponding nondominated criterion vector is (Z1(X1), Z2(X1), …, Zp(X1)). To find the other efficient solutions, in the optimal table calculateΔrj′∀r∈R. If there existsΔrj′>0for some j∉B, r∈R, choose any one and enter that variable into the basis and find the new basic feasible solution.Step 6   In this manner, find the different basic feasible solutions with the corresponding p-tuples (Z1, Z2, …, Zp). If all the solutions are nondominated, then a set of efficient solutions of (MFCP) and consequently a set of R-efficient solutions of (FMCP) (by Theorem 1) is determined; else discard the dominated solutions and find the set of nondominated criterion vectors.Consider the following fuzzy multiobjective fractional fixed charge problem (FMCP) in the context of a ship routing problem [2]. In a network of n=3 ports, at every port cargo is available for shipping within the network. It is assumed that the availability of the cargo is independent of time. It is further assumed that all routes originate and terminate at a home port, and that cargoes are destined to ports which are visited in ascending order of their indices. The problem is in choosing a route and a loading plan for a fleet of ships (k=3 here) so that the loss per unit time is minimized. The expenses of the shipping company consist of fuzzy daily costs in the port and at sea (depending on the time spent loading and unloading the amounts of cargoes at the port and on the chosen route), and of the fuzzy fixed charges at the port. The time required to cover a given route consists of the loading and unloading time of the cargo carried and the route taken and, of the fixed times spent in port and at sea. The objective function is then a ratio of the total cost of shipping to the total time taken for that shipping. The constraints involved in this problem are those on cargo availability and on the cargo carrying capacity of the ship.(FMCP)MinimizeZ˜(X)=(Z˜1(X),Z˜2(X),Z˜3(X))subject to3x1+x2≥62x1+3x2≤10x1,x2≥0whereZ˜1(X)=c˜11x1+c˜12x2+F˜11+F˜12d˜11x1+d˜12x2+f˜11+f˜12+γ˜1,Z˜2(X)=c˜21x1+c˜22x2+F˜21+F˜22d˜21x1+d˜22x2+f˜21+f˜22+γ˜2,Z˜3(X)=c˜31x1+c˜32x2+F˜31+F˜32d˜31x1+d˜32x2+f˜31+f˜32+γ˜3,andc˜ij=(7,8,9)(1,5,11)(3,6,7)(4,8,15)(1,3,5)(1,4,9),d˜ij=(2,4,7)(5,6,7)(3,7,9)(7,9,13)(1,2,3)(1,3,9)γ˜1=(4,8,12),γ˜2=(0,1,2),γ˜3=(0,2,4).Let the fixed chargesF˜rjandf˜rjcorresponding to the variable xjhave three steps and let them be defined asF˜rj=∑k=13δrjkG˜rjk,r=1,2,3,j=1,2f˜rj=∑k=3lηrjkg˜rjk,r=1,2,3,j=1,2whereδrjk=1,ifxj>Arjk0,otherwiseandηrjk=1,ifxj>Brjk0,otherwiseandArj1=0,Arj2=1,Arj3=2;Brj1=0,Brj2=1,Brj3=2.

Also we assume that the level of priority α = 1/2, as chosen by the decision maker.(MFCP−Z1)MinimizeZ1(X)=8x1+5.5x24.25x1+6x2+8subject to3x1+x2≥62x1+3x2≤10x1,x2≥0Here x1=2, x2=0 is the optimal solution of (MFCP-Z1). Corresponding to this basic feasible solution, calculatel1′,η1′andΔ1j′. These are given by Table 1.SinceΔ12′>0, we obtain thatmaxj∉B{Δ1j′|Δ1j′>0}corresponds to j=2. Thus, x2 enters the basis and s2 departs, and the table obtained consequently is given by Table 2below.SinceΔ1j′≤0, ∀j, so the new solution x1=8/7, x2=18/7 is an optimal solution of (MFCP-Z1) and hence the first efficient solution of (MFCP) with criterion vector (0.886, 0.966, 0.803). Also, sinceΔ23′>0we note thatmaxj∉B{Δ2j′|Δ1j′>0}corresponds to j=3. Thus, s1 enters the basis and x2 departs, and we obtain a new solution x1=5, x2=0 corresponding to whichΔ2j′≤0, ∀j.So (5, 0) is the next efficient solution of (MFCP) with criterion vector (1.12, 0.81, 1.024), which is non-dominated. Proceeding like this, another efficient solution is given by x1=2, x2=0 with criterion vector (0.815, 1.104, 1.094). Since no new efficient solution can be obtained further, therefore the set of efficient solutions of (MFCP) and thus the set of R-efficient solutions of (FMCP) is {(8/7, 18/7), (5, 0), (2, 0)}, and the corresponding set of non-dominated criterion vectors is {(0.886, 0.966, 0.803), (1.12, 0.81, 1.024), (0.815, 1.104, 1.094)}.Graphically, it can be seen from Fig. 5.1that the first optimal solution (8/7, 18/7) obtained of (MFCP-Z1) is the extreme point C(8/7, 18/7) of the feasible region (shaded area) of the problem. This is also the first efficient solution of (MFCP). On introducing a new basic variable in the basis in the next iteration, the solution (5, 0) is obtained as the next efficient solution of (MFCP), corresponding to the extreme point B(5, 0) of the feasible region. The next efficient solution is obtained at the extreme point A(2, 0) of the feasible region. It is clear to see from the above that the algorithm moves along the extreme points of the feasible region of the problem to enumerate the set of efficient solutions of (MFCP), and consequently the set of R-efficient solutions of (FMCP).Hence by enumerating the extreme points of the linear fractional programming problem using simplex method with a modified entry criterion, the fuzzy multiobjective fractional fixed charge problem is solved and, a set of Pareto optimal solutions is obtained.
