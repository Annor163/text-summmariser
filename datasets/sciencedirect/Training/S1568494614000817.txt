@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Rating scales are the essential interfaces for many research areas such as in decision making and recommendation. Some issues concerning syntactic and sematic structures are still open to discuss. This research proposes a Compound Linguistic Scale (CLS), a two dimension rating scale, as a promising rating interface. The CLS is comprised of Compound Linguistic Variable (CLV) and Deductive Rating Strategy (DRS). CLV can ideally produce 21 to 73 ((7±2)((7±2)−1)+1) ordinal-in-ordinal rating items, which extends the classic rating scales usually on the basis of 7±2 principle, to better reflect the raters’ preferences whilst DRS is a double step rating approach for a rater to choose a compound linguistic term among two dimensional options on a dynamic rating interface. The numerical analyses show that the proposed CLS can address rating dilemma for a single rater and more accurately reflects consistency among various raters. CLS can be applied to surveys, questionnaires, psychometrics, recommender systems and decision analysis of various application domains.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Measurement consists of rules for assigning symbols to objects so as to (1) represent quantities of attributes numerically (scaling) or (2) define whether the objects fall into the same or into a different category with respect to a given attribute (classification) [31]. A rating scale is essential for measurement and receives many attentions from scholars as its applications including social and engineering sciences are vast.Rating is usually referred to choose the most appropriate item among a set of items according to rater's perception toward an attribute of object. The Likert scale [23] of five or seven points is widely used. Others, or quasi-Likert Scales, which can be regarded as minor variations of Likert scales, include numerical scale, graphic rating scale, visual analogue scale [42], and semantic differential scale [32].The fundamental issues regarding the appropriate number of the rating scale items, and rating accuracy are still open to discuss [34,12,9,41,21,19,20]. Miller (1956) [28] indicated that a rater could usually manage a set with (7±2) items. The qualitative scales such as ordinal or nominal are referred to as being ‘soft’ or ‘weak scales’ [29], as Likert-Style scales are ordinal. [9] found evidence suggesting that as scale granularity increases, recommendation accuracy increases, whilst [36] found that users work harder with more granular rating scales. In views of their findings, this study proposes the Hedge-Direction-Atom Linguistic Representation Algorithm (Algorithm 1) to form two dimensional scale items to strengthen the softness and weakness of the classical scales, and a Deductive Rating Strategy (Algorithm 3) is proposed to handle the rating process of the items.Research of sematic representation for linguistic terms is limited. [37] indicated that linearity of an ordinal scale is open to discuss. The classical research from [14] which compared with [35] investigated twenty modifying words like usually, often, sometimes, occasionally, seldom, rarely and commonly, and the findings conclude that such words do not mean the same thing to all people. [6] argued that the commonly used Likert categories are not necessarily evenly spaced along this level of agreement continuum, although researchers frequently assume that they are. There are many situations where observations cannot be described accurately as, for instance, when they depend on environmental conditions or on individual responses [38]. As lacking theoretical approaches develop a pattern for a collection of linguistic labels represented by number, this research proposes a Fuzzy Normal Distribution Algorithm (Algorithm 2) for this issue.As to the development of the fuzzy set theory, the fuzzy set was firstly introduced by Zadeh (1965). A number of notions extend the concept of this basic notion. Zadeh introduced the idea of type-2 fuzzy set (T2 FS) and computing with words paradigm [45–49]. T2 FS has also been investigated by recent studies (e.g. [26,27,10,1,33,24,50,51]). Atanassov [2] introduced Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set, and later Interval valued fuzzy set [3] have received many attentions by recent studies (e.g. [39,8,22,43,40,13,5,30]). Refs. [15–18,25,11] introduced 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model. The concept of compound linguistic terms computation, however, appears not to receive any attentions from the literature.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the concept of Compound Linguistic Variable and its syntactic rule. The semantic rules, i.e. “Computing with CLV”, are discussed in Section 3. That is how to map the linguistic form of CLV to the numerical form by Fuzzy Normal Distribution. Section 4 presents the Compound Linguistic Scale (CLS), which is formed by CLV and Deductive Rating Strategy (DRS). Section 5 demonstrates the numerical analyses of CLS, which include examining four parameters’ behaviors, and two comparisons for a single user rating and a group of user ratings by using a single dimension rating scale and CLS respectively. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6. This article is essentially derived and revised from the author's thesis [44], especially for reduction of notations’ complexity, and corrections of some presentations. Mathematical proofs are shown in Appendix I, whilst the axiomatic structures are shown in Appendix II.Developing an appropriate schema for the combination of linguistic terms is challenging. It seems a lack of literature to build a system of compound linguistic terms and to compute the mapping between linguistic terms and numbers. To address this, the concept of Compound Linguistic Variable (CLV) is introduced. The established popular concept of linguistic variable is reviewed as below.Definition 1(Linguistic Variable) [45]A linguistic variable is characterized by a quintuple (ℵ, T(ℵ), X, G, M) in which ℵ is the name of a linguistic variable; T(ℵ) (or simply T) denotes the term-set of ℵ, that is, the set of names of linguistic values of ℵ, with each value being a fuzzy variable denoted generally by α and ranging over a universe of discourse X which is associated with the base variable x; G is a syntactic rule (which usually has the form of a grammar) for generating the names, α, of values of ℵ; and M is a semantic rule for associating with each α meaning, M(α), which is a fuzzy subset of X.CLV extending the above concept is revised as below.A Compound Linguistic Variable is characterized by a quintuple (ℵ, Tℵ, Xℵ, Gℵ, Mℵ). ℵ is the name of the Compound Linguistic Variable. A syntactic rule G is the function to generate a term-matrix Tℵ, a matrix of linguistic terms of ℵ. A semantic rule Mℵ is the function to map the linguistic term domain Tℵ into real number domain Xℵ. Each term α in Tℵ, i.e. α∈Tℵ, is associated with a prototype element x, i.e. x∈X, generated by Mℵ.Definitions of notations in Definition 2 replace ones in Definition 1 in this article. To further illustrate CLV, term-matrix is described as follows.A term-matrix of a Compound Linguistic Variable ℵ, i.e. Tℵ, is syntactically mapped from (H, D, A) by a syntactic grammar function for ℵ, i.e. Gℵ, which is defined as follows(1)Gℵ:(H,D,A)↦Tℵ.↦ denotes “be linguistically mapped to”. H, D, and A are increasingly vectorized or ordered, and are defined in Definitions 4–7 as blow respectively.An atomic linguistic term a is the base linguistic element used to describe the statement, or to measure the objects in the initial sense. A vectorized atomic linguistic variable A is the vector of atomic linguistic terms, i.e. a∈A, and has the form:A=[aj]j=1n=[a1,⋯,an]such that a1≤⋯≤an(or denoted by≤j=1n(aj)). n is an odd number and n≥3. For example,A=[Poor, Weak, Fair, Good, Excellent] where Poor≤Weak≤Fair≤Good≤Excellent.A hedge linguistic term h is used to hedge or adjust the linguistic quantity in a. A vectorized hedge linguistic variable H is of the form:H=[hi]i=1ηsuch that≤i=1η(hi)and h∈H. For example, =[Little, Quite, Much] such that Little≤Quite≤Much.A directional term d is used to define a direction for linguistic quantity hedge h. A vectorised directional linguistic variable D usually consists of a vector of three ordinal directional terms, i.e.D=[di]i=13=[d−,dθ,d+]such that≤i=13(di)(or d−≤dθ≤d+). dθis a static direction. d+ modifies h as the positive linguistic quantity modifier whilst d− is the negative linguistic quantity modifier since h is the pure linguistic quantity in nature. For example, D=[Below, Absolutely, Above] such that Below≤Absolutely≤Above.h and d can form a directional hedge linguistic termh→defined as below.LetH→=[h→i]i=1msuch that≤i=1m(h→i). To extend its properties, then(2)h→−=h⊕d−,whereh→−∈H→−=[h→i]i=1η,η=|H→−|(3)h→θ=h⊕dθwhereh→θ=h→η+1(4)h→+=h⊕d+whereh→+∈H→+=[h→i]i=η+2mh→−is a negative hedge linguistic term,h→θis a static hedge linguistic term, andh→+is a positive hedge linguistic term. |·| returns the cardinal number of a set. ⊕ is a linguistic combination operator merging two linguistic terms (“+” is the addition between two numbers). A syntactic function forH→,GH→:(H,D)↦H→, is derived as below.(H→=GH→(H,D)). IfH=[hi]i=1ηand D=[d−, dθ, d+], then(6)H→=GH→(H,D)=[h→i]i=1m=[(hη⊕d−),…,(h1⊕d−),dθ,(h1⊕d+),…,(hη⊕d+)]For example,H→=[“MuchBelow”,“QuiteBelow”,“LittleBelow”,“Absolutely”,“LittleAbove”,“QuiteAbove”,“MuchAbove”]. Whenh→and a are structured as a new term, the definition of a compound linguistic term is given as below.A compound linguistic term α can be formed by a syntactic equation, and has the form:α=Gα(h,d,a)=(h⊕d)⊕a=Gα(h→,a)=h→⊕a,h∈H,d∈D,a∈A.To further illustrate,αij=d→i⊕aj,∀i∈{1,⋯,m}and∀j∈{1,⋯,n}αi=d→i⊕A=[d→i⊕aj]j=1n,∀i∈{1,⋯,m}αj=Vhd⊕vaj=[vhdi⊕vaj]i=1m,∀j∈{1,⋯,n}For example, α3=[“MuchBelowFair”, “QuiteBelowFair”, “LittleBelowFair”, “AbsolutelyFair”, “LittleAboveFair”, “QuiteAboveFair”, “MuchAboveFair”]. However, there are some unusual cases. If “Absolutely Excellent” is defined as the linguistic term of the maximal quantity, there is no need for “Much Above Excellent” in the semantic view. Thus exceptional cases ford→⊕aare defined as follows:Whenh→cannot modify a in the semantic view, such combination does not make sense and returns a null element ∅. Such conditions usually happen as below.(7)h⊕d−⊕a1=h→−⊕a1=∅,∀h→−∈H→−and∀h∈H(8)h⊕d+⊕an=h→+⊕an=∅,∀h→+∈H→+and∀h∈HThere are sufficient postulates to derive a piecewise formula to calculateGα(vhd,va)as below.A syntactic function of αijis of the below form:(9)Gαij(h→,a)=∅j=1&i∈1,⋯,(m+1)2h→i⊕ajj≠1,n&∀i∈{1,...,m}∅j=n&i∈(m+1)2,⋯,mTo extend Proposition 2, the below theorem is satisfied.A syntactic function of CLV denoted as Gℵ, takes H, D, and A as parameters to form an m×n term-matrix Tℵ as follows:Tℵ=Gℵ(H,D,A)=α1⋮αηαη+1αη+2⋮αmα1α2⋯αn−1αn∅h→1⊕a2⋯h→1⊕an−1h→1⊕a2⋮⋮⋱⋮⋮∅h→η⊕a2⋱h→η⊕an−1h→η⊕anh→η+1⊕a1h→η+1⊕a2⋱h→η+1⊕an−1h→η+1⊕anh→η+2⊕a1h→η+2⊕a2⋱h→η+2⊕an−1∅⋮⋮⋱⋮⋮h→m⊕a1h→m⊕a2⋯h→m⊕an−1∅,where(10)h→i∈[(hη⊕d−),⋯,(h1⊕d−),dθ,(h1⊕d+),⋯,(hη⊕d+)].Eq. (10) can be briefly represented by(11)Tℵ=Gℵ(H,D,A)=[h→i⊕aj]j=1ni=1m,where angle brackets denote as transposition. Theorem 1 leads to two corollaries.As |Tℵ|=m×n−2η and m=2η+1 wherem=|H→|and n=|A|, then |Tℵ|=m(n−1)+1.(12)i=η+1,…,m,j=11,…,m,j=2,…,n−11,…,η,j=nThe Hedge-Direction-Atom Linguistic Representation Algorithm (Algorithm 1) is the syntactic algorithm to generate the term-matrix Tℵ of CLV, i.e. Hedge-Direction-Atom Linguistic Representation Model (HAD-LRM).Algorithm 1Syntactic Algorithm For CLV(Hedge-Direction-Atom Linguistic Representation Algorithm: (Tℵ=Gℵ(H, D, A))Provided that three unsorted sets, {Excellent,Good,Fair,Weak,Poor}, {Below,Absolutely,Above}, and {Little,Quite,Much}. Find the Compound Linguistic Variable (CLV).Firstly, Vhand Vd, are vectorised in increasing order as [Below, Absolutely, Above] and [Little Quite Much] respectively, and Va=[Bad, Weak, Fair, Good, Excellent]. Secondly, byH→=GH→(H,D),H→=[h→1,⋯,h→7][“Muchbelow”,“QuiteBelow”,“LittleBelow”,“Absolutely”,“LittleAbove”,“QuiteAbove”,“MuchAbove”]. Thirdly, by Tℵ=Gℵ(H, D, A), the result is shown as belowTℵ=α1α2α3α4α5α6α7α1α2α3α4α5−MB-WMB-FMB-GMB-E−QB-WQB-FQB-GQB-E−LB-WLB-FLB-GLB-EA-BA-WA-FA-GA-ELA-BLA-WLA-FLA-G−QA-BQA-WQA-FQA-G−MA-BMA-WMA-FMA-G−Example 1 shows that three vectors of linguistic terms can produce a large scale of linguistic terms organized in a matrix form. These linguistic terms can be used for describing an attribute of an object in a more precise linguistic expression. When several linguistic terms are combined as a meaningful compound one, the matrix structure cannot be formed only by computing linguistic combination without human understanding. Thus the syntactic design needs verification from experts. Experts should firstly determine an attribute of a linguistic measurable object, then justify appropriate A to describe the attribute, and design the appropriate H and D to fine-tune A.The next question is how the semantic rule can be represented for the CLV. That is how to use a matrix of numerical values to represent a matrix of linguistic terms. The next section addresses this.The semantic rule, Mℵ:Tℵ→Xℵ, is to map a linguistic term matrix Tℵ to a numerical matrix Xℵ in crisp or fuzzy number. To implement Mℵ, this paper proposes Fuzzy Normal Distribution ((Tℵ, Xℵ, μ), (MFI, FI, P, μ−1)). (Tℵ, Xℵ, μ) is a ℵ-Design Procedure (ℵ-DP), and (MFI, FI, P, μ−1) is a Fuzzy Interval Distribution (FID).The ℵ-DP is to associate each atomic linguistic term ajwith a Normal Single Core Symmetric Convex (NSCSC) fuzzy set αjcharacterized by its membership functionμαj. aj, j=1,2,…,n, is a column vector in the linguistic term-matrix Tℵ, whilst αjis a column vector in the numerical matrix Xℵ. Once ajis represented by αjthrough ℵ-DP, αjis classified into[αij]i=1mby FID. In other words, αjis the numerical representation for aj, and is used to produce a collection of[αij]i=1m, since ajcan be modified byh→i(Proposition 2). FID is used to classify αjinto[αij]i=1msubject to Proposition 2.The Fuzzy Interval Distribution (MFI, FI, P, μ−1) is the function to map a collection of membership fuzzy intervals MFI(Tℵ) to a collection of fuzzy intervals FI(Tℵ) by a corresponding Position function P of the corresponding inversed membership function μ−1 of MFI(Tℵ) such that FI(Tℵ)=μ−1(P(MFI(Tℵ))). MFI and FI will be specified in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 in details. μ−1 is the inversed function of a membership function μ characterized by a NSCSC fuzzy set introduced as follows.A Normal Single Core Symmetric Convex (NSCSC) fuzzy set αjof whole shape (Fig. 1) is characterized by a 4-tuple(x,γαj,dαj,μαj), which satisfies the properties:1.Normality:supx∈X(μαj(x))=1, x∈X, and X is the universal of discourse;Convexity: μ(kxi+(1−k)xj)≥min{μ(xi), μ(xj)}, k∈[0, 1], xi, xj∈X;Single core:SC(αj)=(γαj,1)such that there exists only one element prototypeγαjsatisfyingμαj(γαj)=1.γαjis located in the left most point, middle point, or right most point (Fig. 1).Symmetric prototype interval in Whole Shape fuzzy set:[xl,xu]αj=[γαj−dαj,γαj+dαj], wheredαjis the symmetric distance, i.e.dαj=1/2(xu−xl);Symmetric membership distribution:μαj(γαj−x)=μαj(γαj+x),x∈[γαj−dαj,γαj+dαj];Regarding the shapes of the NSSCS fuzzy sets (Fig. 1), the Whole Shape (WS) of a SCS fuzzy set consists of a Left Half Portion (LHP) and a Right Half Portion (RHP) which are segmented by a singleton line. A singleton line exists in a prototype x in X such that its membership is equal to one. A Half Portion (HP) means either LHP or RHP, i.e. HP∈{LHP, RHP}.The shape of α1 is the LHP in the most left hand side in the universal of discourse X whilst αnis the RHP in the most right hand side in X. αj=2,⋯,n−1 is the whole shape distributed in X. Regarding the shape of the membership function, for a NSCSC fuzzy set, if the membership is linear based, a Triangular-based Membership Function is of the form:(13)μαj=TbMFαj=x+dαj−γαjdαjταj,x∈[γαj−dαj,γαj]1,x=γαj−x+dαj+γαjdαjταj,x∈[γαj,γαj+dαj],ταjistuninglevel.This follows the Triangular-based Inversed Membership FunctionTbMFαj−1for the base element (or prototype) xϕ, where ϕ='−', 'θ', '+', which represent x locating in LHP, singleton, and RHP respectively.(14)xϕ=μαjϕ−1(μαjϕ)=TbMFαj−1=γαj−dαj+dαj(μαjϕ)1/ταj,ϕ='−'γαj,ϕ='θ'γαj+dαj−dαj(μαjϕ)1/ταj,ϕ='+'Similarly, if the shape function is the Parabola-based Membership function, then(15)μαj=PbMFαj=−1dαj2x2+2γαjdαj2x+dαj2−γαj2dαj2ταj,x∈[αlj,αuj]The Parabola-based Membership Inversed FunctionPbMFαj−1for the base element xϕis of the form:(16)xϕ=μαjϕ−1(μαjϕ)=PbMFαj−1(μαjϕ)=γαj−dαj1−(μαjϕ)1/ταj,ϕ='−'γαj,ϕ='θ'γαj+dαj1−(μαjϕ)1/ταj,ϕ='+'In selection of the membership functions, three criteria should be satisfied [4]: available domain knowledge, simplicity of the membership function, and possible parametric optimization of the fuzzy sets (calibration of the membership function).Membership fuzziness distribution (MFD) is characterized by(〈H〉,D,α,μ,φ,dis,MCI,λ,Ξ,ϕ,vip,hrp,MFI). The membership space μ=[0,1] can be fuzzily classified by H. The membership utility measurement function φ(H) is the numerical measurement for Vh. The distance ofvhi∈Vh, i.e.dis(vhi), is characterized by the proportion of φ(hi) in ∑Hφ(hi). On the basis of a collection of dis(〈H〉), Membership Crisp Interval function MCI determines a collection of close intervals of elements in H. A Membership Fuzziness Factor λ, which is validated by a MFF validation function Ξ fuzzifies the MCI(〈H〉) into a collection of Membership Fuzziness Intervals, i.e. MFI(〈H〉). Hϕ='−','θ','+' is determined by D. MFI(〈H−〉) is determined by a Vertically Inversed Position function vip of MFI(〈H〉) whilst MFI(〈H+〉) is determined by a Horizontally Reversed Position function hrp of MFI(〈H〉). Finally, MFI(αj) is determined by MFI(Hϕ). For a better presentation of elements, HTorH, transposition of H, is preferred. Fig. 2graphically presents the MFD method.For MFI(H), if a fuzzy boundary needs to be determined, a crisp boundary can firstly be investigated and then is fuzzified to a fuzzy boundary by A Membership Fuzziness Factor λ. MFI is, thus, determined by (MCI, λ).Definition 10(MFI(〈H〉))The MFI of 〈H〉 is determined by the lower boundary (μL) and upper boundary (μU) of the membership, and has the form:(17)MFI(〈H〉)=MFI(h1)⋮MFI(hη)=μLμUμl1μu1⋮⋮μlημuη=μLμU〈μlj,μuj〉j=1η,where the vectorsμL=〈μli〉i=1η,μU=〈μui〉i=1η.To determineμljandμuj, the concept of Membership Crisp Interval MCI is introduced. MCI is determined by a membership distance function dis and a Membership Utility Measurement function φ.The membership distance function is of the form(18)dis(hi)=φ(hi)∑Hφ(hi),i∈{1,2,⋯,η}.The Membership Utility Measurement function of H is of the form φ(H)=[φ(h1), ⋯, φ(hη)].On the basis of Definitions 10 and 11, MCI(H) is calculated as follows.Proposition 3(MCI(H))Membership Crisp Interval function of hiproduces a membership crisp interval for hi, i.e.MCI(hi)=[μ′liμ′ui]. MCI(〈H〉) is of the two-column matrix as blow.(19)MCI(〈H〉)=MCI(〈hj〉η1)=μ′Lμ′U〈μ′lj,μ′uj〉j=1ηwhich is determined by(20)μ′Lμ′U〈μ′lj,μ′uj〉j=1η=μ′Lμ′U∑i=j+1ηdis(hi),∑i=jηdis(hi)j=1ηwhereμ′lη=0andμ′u1=1, i∈{1, 2, ⋯, η}.The next step is to define Membership Fuzziness Factors to fuzzify MCI to MFI.The Membership Fuzziness Factors ofμ′uiandμ′li, denoted byλμuiandλμlirespectively, are used to fuzzify MCI to MFI. They have the forms:(21)λμui=λμli=λ02,whereλμui,λμli∈[0,1](i.e.λ0∈[0,2])(22)μui=μ′ui=1,i=1μ′ui+λμuidis(hi),i=2,⋯,η(23)μli=μ′li−λμlidis(hi),i=1,⋯,η−1μ′li=0,i=ηλ is a general form of λ0,λμuiorλμli. (21) is the default definition forλμliandλμui. Ifλμuiorλμliis excessively large,μuiorμlimay be larger than 1 or less than 0. This situation follows Lemma 1 as the constraints.The MFF validation function Ξ for validatingλμliorλμui, has the below forms.(24)Ξ(λμui)=λμui,0≤μui≤1"error",μui>1orμli<0,∀i∈{2,⋯,η}(25)Ξ(λμli)=λμli,0≤μli≤1"error",μli>1orμli<0,∀i∈{1,⋯,η−1}If there is an “error”, λ has to be justified again.The membership space [0,1] is fuzzily divided into a collection of membership fuzzy intervals with respect to 〈H〉 by the Membership Fuzziness Interval function taking λ. The collection of Membership Fuzzy Intervals of 〈H〉, i.e. MFI(〈H〉) is presented by μLand μU. λ fuzzifies the MCI. MFI has the form:(26)MFI(〈H〉)=MFIh1⋮hη=μ′li−λμlidis(hi),1i=1〈μ′li−λμlidis(hi),μ′ui+λμlidis(hi)〉i=2η−1[0,μ'ui+λμlidis(hi)]i=η,whereλμliandλμuiare confined to (24) and (25) in Lemma 1 respectively.A fuzzy interval FI of αij, denoted by FI(αij), is in the portion[xli,xui]of the prototype space of αjin X that is(27)FI(αij)=αj[xli,xui]A variable name before an interval specifies where the fuzzy interval belongs to. The variable name may be omitted if the interval is indicated where it belongs to in advance. For listing the fuzzy intervals with the set of members, then(28)FI(〈αj〉)=FI(〈αij〉j=1m)=αj〈xli,xui〉i=1mSimilarly,FI(Tℵ)=FI([αj]j=1n),FI(αj)=FI(〈αij〉i=1m),FI(αj−)=FI(〈αij〉i=1η),FI(αj+)=FI(〈αij〉i=η+2m).The Fuzzy Interval Distribution (MFI, FI, P, μ−1) is the function to map a collection of membership fuzzy intervals MFI(Tℵ) to a collection of (prototype) fuzzy intervals FI(Tℵ) by the corresponding Position function P of the corresponding inversed membership function μ−1 of MFI(Tℵ), i.e. FI(Tℵ)=μ−1(P(MFI(Tℵ))). μ−1 is specified as different kinds in Theorem 2.P∈{vip,hrp}is described in Propositions 5 and 6. Fig. 2 graphically summarizes the method for designing MFI(〈H〉) where η=|H|=3. Fig. 3shows the mapping relationship from MFI(〈hi〉) to FI(αij). Considering a singleMFI(vhi), two fuzzy intervals are located in RHP and LHP respectively. P is introduced to choose the right interval. This issue leads to two relationships for discussion:(29)1.MFI(H)→MFI(H−),asH−isrelatedtoRHP.(30)2.MFI(H)→MFI(H+),asH+isrelatedtoLHP.To further define,μα−(x)∈[0,1]:x∈xRHP, where xRHPis the set of the prototypes of RHP. Similarly,μα+(x)∈[0,1]:x∈xLHP. For MFI(H)→MFI(H−),(μli−,μui−):(μli,μui)∈MFI(H−). For MFI(H)→MFI(H+),(μli+,μui+):(μli,μui)∈MFI(H+).

To have (31)–(33), Lemma 2 is derived as below.Lemma 2(Left and Right membership portion property)For RHP (ϕ='−'), iifxli≤xui, thenμli≤μui, orμli−≤μui−.

Theorem 2 returns a matrix of interval representation values of linguistic terms. The crisp representation values from the intervals are defined as follows.Regarding M(Tℵ):Tℵ→Xℵ, if Tℵ is represented by a matrix in crisp number denoted byX¯ℵ, thenX¯ℵ=MX¯(Tℵ)=mean(FI(Tℵ)). Similarly, for each entry inX¯ℵ,X¯αij=MX¯(αij)=mean(FI(αij)).MX¯(Tℵ)returns a matrix of crisp numbers. A fuzzy number is presented by a modal value and a pair of interval values. Thus on the basis of Theorem 2 and Definition 13, CLV represented by a matrix in fuzzy number is defined as below.ForMX⌢(Tℵ):Tℵ→X⌢ℵ, if Tℵ is represented by a matrix in fuzzy number,X⌢ℵ, thenX⌢ℵ=MX⌢(Tℵ)=[〈(xlij,xπij,xuij)〉i=1m]j=1n, where a pair of interval values[xlij,xuij]∈FI(Tℵ)is from Theorem 2, and usually the modal valuexπij∈mean(FI(Tℵ))is from Definition 13. For some specifications, as(xlij,xπij,xuij),i=η+1,j=1,…,nis of a singleton,(xlη+1,j,xπη+1,j,xuη+1,j)is defined as a non-singleton(xπη,j,xπη+1,j,xπη+2,j), j=2,…,n−1. Additionally,xπij=xlijif a fuzzy number is of LHP, whilstxπij=xuijif a fuzzy number is of RHP. Such specifications normally take places when the fuzzy numbers, e.g. αη+1,1 and αη+1,n, are in the most left and right hand sides of the prototype domain X respectively, i.e.xπη+1,1=xlη+1,1andxπη+1,n=xuη+1,n. Thus(xlη+1,1,xπη+1,1,xuη+1,1)=(xπη+1,1,xπη+1,1,xπη+2,1)and(xlη+1,n,xπη+1,n,xuη+1,n)=(xπη,n,xπη+1,n,xπη+1,n).The numerical results of M(Tℵ) can be either fuzzy or crisp. When a bar is over X, i.e.MX¯(Tℵ), the results are crisp. When an arc is over X, i.e.MX⌢(Tℵ), the results are fuzzy. Algorithm 2 concludes the concept of Fuzzy Normal Distribution.(Xℵ=M(Tℵ)=FND(λ0,φH,ταj,μαjϕ−1,γαj,dαj,XThis example is the continuation of Example 1, and illustrates Algorithm 2. Let X=[1, 5],γ→=[γα1,…,γα5]=[1,2,3,4,5],dαj=1,ταj=2, j=1,…,5,μαj−1=PbMF−1,φH=[1,2,3], λ0=0.5. The calculation steps are as follows.Steps 1–3 are given as above.Step 4: Asdis(Vh→)=[dis("little")dis("quite")dis("much")]=1/61/31/2and η=3, thenMCI(〈H〉)=MCIh1h2h3=μ′Lμ′U0.833310.50000.833300.5000As λ0=0.5, thenλμui=λμli=(λ0/2)=0.25. Thus MFI is of the form:MFI(〈H〉)=μLμU0.791710.41670.916700.6250Step 5:MFI(〈H+〉)=hrp(MFI(〈H〉))=μLμU10.79170.91670.41670.62500MFI(〈H−〉)=vip(MFI(〈H〉))=μLμU00.62500.41670.91670.79170Step 6:FI(〈α3〉) is taken as an example, thenFI(〈α3〉)=FIMFI(〈H+〉)MFI(〈dθ〉)MFI(〈H−〉)=22.54242.40462.79372.66803.00003.00003.00003.00003.3323.20633.59543.45764.0000.Finally,X¯α3=MX¯(α3)=mean(FI(〈α3〉))=2.272.602.843.003.163.403.73T.Step 7: Calculations for FI(〈α1〉)…FI(〈α5〉) are performed in a similar way. Table 1shows the final results for Tℵ in crisp number.Steps 8 and 9: Table 2shows the representation values are in fuzzy number if the modal values take the means of the intervals.In this example,γ→=1,2,3,4,5is assumed on the basis of the rank order in Likert scale which is widely used in the survey form. Fuzzy Normal Distribution can be used to produce a vector of representation numbers forγ→and then make further calculation by FND again. The next section discusses the rating strategy of a matrix of scale options, and finally the CLS is formed.Human can handle the ranking with limited alternatives. The highly cited study [28] indicated that an expert can manage a set with (7±2) terms. Bonissine and Decker (1985) [7] used 13 terms in their example. In 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model, a sound model of “computing with words” with a proposal of up to 15 terms was proposed (e.g. [17,16]), and the proposal of 49 labels in [11]. However, the term-set does not illustrate the linguistic label for each term, and it is unreasonable for the expert to rate using mathematical symbols only. This is open to discuss to use single rating step to manage the rating. In this study, it seems incredible that an expert can handle |(Tℵ7±1,7±2)|=[21, 73] (Corollary 1) linguistic terms although CLV can produce a large scale of compound linguistic terms. This incredibility can be solved by Deductive Rating Strategy as below.Definition 15(DRS)Deductive Rating Strategy is characterized by(H→j,A,Rs,℘). A is the vector of the first rating items with atomic descriptors〈aj〉j=1n, andH→jis the vector of the second rating items derived from the Second Rating Alternatives Transformation Function Rs ofvaj∈Va. Dynamic Rating Interface ℘ is the graphical user interface for the rater to perform rating activities.Proposition 8 shows how the second rating items are displayed.Proposition 8(H→j=Rs(aj))The Second Rating Alternatives Transformation Function (Rs) produces a vector of the second rating items, and has the below form.(39)H→j=Rs(aj)=〈h→i〉i=1η,ifj=1〈h→i〉i=1m,if1<j<n〈h→i〉i=η+2m,ifj=nTo conclude, Compound Linguistic Scale is defined as below.Definition 16(CLS)A Compound Linguistic Scale is characterized by a 2-tupleCLV,DRS, i.e.((ℵ,Tℵ,Xℵ,Gℵ,Mℵ),(H→j,A,Rs,℘)). CLV is defined in Definition 2 where the syntactic rule is implemented in Algorithm 1 and the sematic rule is implemented in Algorithm 2. A Deductive Rating Strategy (DRS) is defined in Definition 15 and implemented in Algorithm 3.There may be a possible suggestion to have more than two dimension spaces in the rating process. However, the question is whether they are necessary and practical. One concern is how to use linguistic terms to form such rich dimension spaces in a meaningful way. Another concern is how many times for a rater need to rate in a single survey. Classical approach is one time. It may be unclear to express the quantity in very limited linguistic terms and finally influence the accuracy of the research result. Thus the CLS suggests two times should be sufficient. However, if three times or more, raters are likely impatient to finish the survey, especially the survey of many questions. Thus two step rating process is the appropriate way to maintain the consistence and accuracy of the approximate rating results. Finally, Algorithm 3 concludes this section.Algorithm 3Deductive Rating Strategy(H→j,A,Rs,℘)This example is the continuation of previous two examples, and presents how to choose “little below good” using Algorithm 3 (see Fig. 4).Step 1: A rater reads a question in the survey form: how do you feel our customer service?Step 2:Fig. 4-1 shows the interface provides only five options (in A) for the rater. Then the rater initially chooses “Good” (i.e. a4), when he is thinking about the rating score is between “Fair” and “Good”, but more likely approaches to “Good”.Step 3: As soon as “Good” is selected, the dynamic rating interface displays 7 options (shown in Figs. 4 and 5), as the vector of the second linguistic termsH→4is generated by a Second Rating Alternatives Transformation Function Rs(a4).Step 4: As the rater thinks that the service rating approaches to “Good”, he chooses a “Little Below” to fine-tune his first option.Step 5: The compound linguistic term α3,4, “Little Below Good”, is made for the question.Instead of selecting one from|(Tℵ)7,5|=29, which is difficult to achieve, the rater just selects one from 5 (|Aa|) items, and then selects one from 4 (|H→1|∨|H→5|) or 7 (|H→2|∨|H→3|∨|H→4|) items only.In Algorithm 2, (λ0, φ(H),ταj,μαjϕ−1,γαj,dαj, Xℵ) is a set of input parameters to run for the representation values. In Examples 1 and 2,γαj,dαj, and Xℵ are defined for the testing scenario. Other parameters may need a scaling procedure to find the most suitable values. In order to support the scaling procedure, Cases 1–4 examine the influences of the four parameters (λ0, φ(H),ταj,μαjϕ−1) for the number representationX¯αij: j=3, i=1,…,7 respectively. In addition, Cases 5 and 6 investigate how CLS performs better than the classical rating scale. The default parameters use the specifications of Examples 1 and 2, except forτα1,…,5=1.Case 1Relationship of λ0 andX¯αijλ0 is defined in Definition 12. Its availability range is tested in this case. From Fig. 5, if λ0≤1 (orλμli=λμui≤0.5), the relationship of λ0 andX¯αijcan be described by the linear regression functionX¯αij=a¯αijλ0+b¯αijas R2 is approximate to one. Ifλμliorλμuiis excessively large, the overlap of the fuzzy interval is excessively large and “Error” is given according to Lemma 1, i.e. the upper boundary is not more than 1 and the lower boundary is not less than 0. The appropriate λ0 depends on various situations. From the above analysis, λ0∈[0, 1] is recommended. By default, λ0=0.5 is chosen.φ(H) is defined in Definition 11. Assume the setφ¯(H)={[1,2,3],[1,1,1],[3,2,1]}. Fig. 6presents the plots of αi,j=3, ∀i∈{1, …, 7}, versus the number representationX¯αijfor each measure values setφk∈φ¯(H), i.e.X¯φk. To conclude, ifφ1=[φ(hi):<i=1ηφ(hi)],φ2=[φ(hi):=i=1ηφ(hi)], andφ3=[φ(hi):>i=1ηφ(hi)], thenX¯φ3≥X¯φ1≥X¯φ2in αj+, and conversely,X¯φ3≤X¯φ1≤X¯φ2in αj−. This issue indicates that a horizontal tendency of the slope which means that the representation numbers of[αi,j=3]i=17are closer whilst the more vertical one means that the representation numbers are more dispersed.φHis defined in Eqs. (13)–(16). The numerical sensitivities are tested in this case. Two sets are assumed:τ¯αj=3={0.1,0.2,⋯,1}, which is used to smooth the shape, andτ¯′α3={1,2,⋯,10}, which is used to sharpen the shape, whereτα3k,τα3∈τ¯α3andτ′α3k,τα3∈τ¯′α3. Fig. 7shows the relationship betweenτ¯α3andX¯αi,j=3, which can be presented by the regression linesX¯αi,j=3=a¯αi,j=3ταj=3k+b¯αi,j=3, and i=1,…,7. Fig. 7 shows that the largerταjkleads to the larger convergence ofX¯αij, since the smallerταjk(e.g.ταjk=1=0.1) leads to the shape of the membership approximate to a rounded rectangular shape, and the largerταjk(e.g.ταj10=1) results in less smoothing in the parabola shape.The results of comparisons ofτ¯′α3andX¯αijare presented in Fig. 8. The largerτ′αjkis more likely to lead to convergence to a constant, which is an abnormal value. This abnormal situation is for the reason that the largerτ′αjkproduces greater sharpness of the shape which is finally approximate to a singleton line and never contains fuzzy overlap with adjacent fuzzy sets. In other words, the meaning of fuzziness loss ifτ′αjkis excessively large. The convergent abnormal values are concluded as:forταj→∞,X¯αi,j→γαj−0.5dαj,i=1X¯αη+1,j=γαj,i=2,⋯,m−1γαj+0.5dαj,i=m,j=1,i=1,…,η2,…,n−1,i=1,…,mn,i=η,…,m, In this scenario,X¯α1,3=2.5,X¯α2,3=X¯α3,3=X¯α4,3=X¯α5,3=X¯α6,3=3.0=3.5.These abnormal results are explained by each representation number not being the same. If some of them are the same, some linguistic terms are redundant. Each linguistic term, therefore, should contain a reasonable distance between two adjacent linguistic terms. In the above two analyses,0.5≤ταj≤4should be the reasonable distance by observation. By default,ταj=1.μαjϕ−1is defined in Eqs. (13)–(16). The numerical sensitivities by using differentταjand different membership shapes are tested. If the triangular membership function is applied, the result is different from case 3. As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the lines of[X¯αi,3]i=17also converge whenτ¯α3increases. The group of the lines of TbMF converges more rapidly than the group of PbMF. This can be explained by the sharpness of TbMF, which is larger than the one of PbMF giving the same value ofταj. It can be concluded that the different membership functions contribute to the different speeds of convergent patterns of the group of lines. The convergence speeds of the group of lines can be affected by the shape whether is concave or convex with different levels from the basic curves (e.g. triangular or parabola) after the different power indices τ’s are applied. By default, PbMF is used due to the relative stability.This case is to compare CLS and Likert-style scales (or single dimension scale). Assumption 1 is that two raters face a rating dilemma to choose one between “fair”, i.e. 3, and “good”, i.e. 4, in a Likert-style scale. Assumption 2 is that two raters have similar views. Due to this rating dilemma, one chooses “fair” and another one chooses “good”. Bias of this scale is induced and is measured by the standard deviationσ=1/2((3−3.5)2+(4−3.5)2)=0.5. If both rate “fair”, the result is underestimated, while it is overestimated if they both choose “good”, since the preference value should be located between 3 and 4 on the basis of the first assumption. As there is no extra option in the middle, CLS can help to address this problem with providing the extra option.The linguistic labels and their represented values of CLS are applied in Table 1 in Example 2. The rater has a rating dilemma in choosing either αjand αj+1, j=3, initially. If αjis chosen firstly, thenh→i, i=1, …,7, is chosen fromH→j=Rs(αj). If αj+1 is chosen first, thenh→iis chosen fromH→j+1. If one rater does the first case, and another one does the second case, the combination of αi,jand αi',j+1 is |αj|×|αj+1|=7×7=49, j=3. The bias of αi,jand αi',j+1 is measured by the standard deviation. Fig. 11exhibits the distribution of σ of all possible combinations ofX¯αi,jandX¯αi',j+1.σ<0.5 means that the raters have similar views. If the raters have similar views, there will be a rating tendency. For example, if one rater starts from αj=3, αi=5,…,7,j=3 are possible options, whilst αi=1,…,3,j=4 are possible options if another rater starts from αj=4. Thus, by observing the lines ofX¯α5,3,X¯α6,3, andX¯α7,3along with the X-axis fromX¯α1,4toX¯α3,4, there is σ<0.42 in Region A of Fig. 11. CLS could reduce the bias from the raters, and has better accuracy than the classical Likert-style scales, as the new rating interface has second rating chance.If the raters choose αi=4,j=3 and αi=4,j=4 respectively, their opinions are different, since the probability of this combination is quite small i.e. 1/49=0.0204. Although the bias is the same as those from Likert-style scales with αj=3 and αj=4, Likert-style scales cannot clearly reflect that raters’ different opinions, as the probability of this combination is high, i.e.αj=3×αj=4=1. In other words, Likert-style scales force raters to have biased opinions where there is the value in the middle due to no extra suitable choices for raters. Similarly, if the choices are αi=1,…,3,j=3 and αi=5,…,7,j=4 respectively, the raters have an obvious bias, as the tendency is opposite. This violates the assumption 1-the rating dilemma. CLS, therefore, can reflect the bias from raters due to this tendency measure.Case 6Group Rating ImprovementThe case shows the improvement for the group ratings by using CLS from Examples 1–3. Five raters (raters 1, 2, …, 5) evaluate scores for an object respectively. Let their reference scores be (3.3, 2.7, 2.8, 1.7, 3.8). Assume that the most appropriate scale items are assigned to the object. Thus, the linguistic terms of Likert-style Scales are approximate to (F, F, F, W, G) whilst CLS is approximate to (QA-F, MA-W, LB-F, MA-B, LB-G). The representation values, the notations, the conventional statistical results and the improvement are presented in Table 3. “Improvement” is calculated byPk=sk−s′k−s¯k−s′ksk−s′k×100%sk−s¯ksk×100%,k=1,…,8,k=9,10,11The results show that CLS can address the weakness of classical ordinal model. For individual rating improvement, the average improvement is 83.3% (Average (66.7%, 90%, 85%, 90%, 85%)). For statistical measurement improvements, values of the operators, sum, mean and standard deviation, improve 68.6%, 68.6%, and 86.3% respectively. For the error reduction, the difference of SD, average of obsolete errors, and root mean square errors reduce more than 80%.Some real world applications, especially in the research of business management and social sciences, may be related to thousands of raters for measuring a number of objects with a collection of criteria for each object. Some applications may be related to many criteria with a single rater, e.g. psychological tests. CLS can reduce the measurement errors and statistical errors due to its rich approximation capability of the rating scales.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Compound Linguistic Scale is comprised of Compound Linguistic Variable and Deductive Rating Strategy. The Compound Linguistic Variable contains a matrix of linguistic terms, which is mapped to a matrix of numerical values by Fuzzy Normal Distribution using a few scalable parameters. The Deductive Rating Strategy manages the rating process from CLV in a dynamic rating interface. Three algorithms are developed for CLS. Three examples exhibit the usability. Six cases are tested for the validity and applicability. CLS can improve the rating accuracy. CLS can be applied to the Cognitive Network Process ([44,52–55]). CLS can be used as a measurement instrument in various fields, such as survey, questionnaire, psychometrics, rater statistics, recommender systems, as well as multicriteria and multiexpert decision systems.
