@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Risk prices are calculated as the certainty equivalents of risky assets, using a recently developed non-expected utility (non-EU) approach to quantitative risk assessment. The present formalism for the pricing of risk is computationally simple, realistic in the sense of behavioural economics and straightforward to apply in operational research and risk and decision analyses.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The intrinsic price of a risky asset of random monetary value X is the certainty equivalent cpof the probability distribution p(X). The term “intrinsic” refers to risk quantification within a given accounting system rather than to risk prices extrinsically determined by the market for the asset. In the framework of utility theory, the certainty equivalent of a risk p is implicitly defined by the requirement(1)U(p)=U(cp),p∈P,where U is a real-valued utility functional defined on a space P of probability distributions and cp, cp∈ P, is the degenerate risk which gives the result X = cpwith certainty. In Eq. (1) and throughout this research note, we do not accordingly distinguish between real numbers x and degenerate probability distributions which give X = x with certainty. We also abbreviate p(X = x) as p(x), as is usual elsewhere.Procedures to specify certainty equivalents are useful in theoretical and applied risk research. They can help to rank-order risk preferences in simple and consistent ways, to determine intrinsic risk prices in finance and insurance applications and to provide experimental tests of theories of utility (Becker, DeGroot, & Marschak, 1964; Farquhar, 1984; Denuit, Dhaene, Goovaerts, Kaas, & Laeven, 2006). But within the theoretical frameworks of EU and non-EU theory, they rarely admit explicit solutions of Eq. (1) for cp(Denuit et al., 2006). Alternatively, to solve Eq. (1) for cpby numerical approximation, the utility and probability weighting functions on which representations of U are typically based must often be determined empirically (for a compilation of the extensive literature, see van de Kuilen & Wakker, 2011) or chosen ad hoc as parametric functions (Stott, 2006) and then fitted to the experimental data. The latter step demands, in addition, considerable methodological effort (for review, see Abdellaoui, Bleichrodt, & L'Haridon, 2008). As for general methodological foundations, recent experimental results and reference to the literature on risk-pricing behaviour, see Blavatskyy and Köhler (2009, 2011).In the following, Eq. (1) will be solved for cpwithin a recently developed axiomatic framework of status quo dependent risky choice involving a non-EU utility functional U. U accommodates systematic violations of EU theory of various kinds observed in risky choice experiments (Geiger, 2008, 2012). It will be shown that cppossesses an explicit representation solely involving the cumulative probabilities of gain and loss associated with p and a few exogenous parameters that are not related to p. This result will then be extended to utility preferences for multivariate risks. Applications to recent experimental results on risk pricing behaviour will also be indicated. The present formalism for the intrinsic pricing of risk may thus be of theoretical and practical use in wide areas of operational research and risk management.We consider a convex set P of simple probability distributions p defined on a compact real interval I. A person's attitude towards a given risk p is assumed to be governed, besides by p, by his or her neutral reference point x0, x0 ∈ I, status quo risk s, s ∈ P, and relative persistence ε of p in the presence of s, that is, overall probability ε of Tp> Ts, where Tpand Tsare the uncertain times to resolution of p and s. Accordingly, ε(Tp> Ts) generally varies with p for given status quo s.11The interpretation of ε as ε(Tp> Ts) is as in Geiger (2012), but differs from that in Geiger (2002, 2008), where ε is defined as the complementary probability ε(Tp≤ Ts) obtained by substituting ε → 1 – ε. Our formal results remain unaffected by this change in denotation, but the present specification of ε is appropriate in applications as it gives the correct limiting behaviour of the utility function in the boundary cases ε = 0 and ε = 1 (Geiger 2012).To avoid trivial cases, s is non-degenerate and involves at least some chance of gain s(x) > 0 for some x > x0, x ∈ I, and some risk of loss s(x´) > 0 for some x´ < x0, x´ ∈ I. In applications of the formalism, the parameters x0, ε and s will normally be measurable or can be estimated with some confidence by standard statistical methods (status quo risk) and multivariate survival, or hazard rate, analysis (probability ε(Tp> Ts)). Without loss of generality, x0 is normalised to x0 = 0. As an option of choice, to stay in one's status quo (i.e., choose s given s) amounts to selecting the degenerate risk 0 given s, that is, adding nothing to s with certainty. Hence, cs= 0. As for the axiomatic foundations and for more detailed explanations of the approach, see Geiger (2002, 2008).To state the basic equations of utility preference for which Eq. (1) is to be solved, the following variables must be defined (Fig. 1): λp= (1 – Fp(0))/(1 – p(0)) and 1 – λprespectively are the overall relative probabilities of gain and loss (Fpis the cumulative distribution of p) so that p = p+λp+ p–(1 – λp), where p+(x) = p(x)/λpand p–(x)  0 for x > 0, p–(x) = p(x)/(1 – λp) and p+(x)  0 for x < 0, and p+(0) = p–(0) = p(0) if 0 < λp< 1. If, on the other hand, λp= 1 or λp= 0, then p± = p, respectively. The expected gain (loss) isμp±=∑x∈Spxp±(x), where Spis the support of p andμp=μp+λp+μp−(1−λp). Finally, for every p ∈ P with 0 < λp< 1, there exists a uniquep0,p0=p+λp0+p−(1−λp0), so that p0 and s are “isoneutral” in preference (i. e.,cp0=cs=0), whereλp0is determined by(2)μs(μs+−μs−)λs(1−λs)=μp+λp0+μp−(1−λp0)(μp+−μp−)λp0(1−λp0)(Geiger, 2008, Sec. 5).The basic equations of the approach involve a probability-dependent utility function u(p, x) and the functionalU:P→Rso that(3)−u(p,μp+)u(p,μp−)=ɛ(1−λp)+(1−ɛ)(1−λp0)ɛλp+(1−ɛ)λp0,μp−<0(4)U(p)=(1−p(0))(u(p,μp−)(1−λp)+u(p,μp+)λp),(5)U(p)=U(q)⇔u(p,x)=u(q,x),p∈P,q∈P,x∈I(6)u(p,−x)=A(p)u(p,x),x≥0,A>0where A(p) is a parameter-dependent elementary algebraic function (parameters ε, s; see Geiger, 2008, pp. 131–132). In Eq. (5), ε(Tp> Ts) = ε(Tq> Ts) is tacitly assumed. U and u are unique up to positive affine transformations of the utility scale. They are normalised to u(p, 0) = 0, u(p, –1) = –1, U(0) = 0 and U(–1) = –1. It is important to note that in Eq. (4) the assessment of p in terms of cumulative gains and losses is a consequence of the general principles underlying the approach, notably the assumption of a neutral reference point and an axiom of status quo dependence of risk preferences. As for the empirical significance of the cumulative probabilities of success and failure in risky choice, see Fennema and Wakker (1997), Payne (2005) and Diecidue and van de Ven (2008).The dependence of u on x has been made explicit elsewhere. Here, it suffices to note that u(p, x) is everywhere smooth and strictly increasing in x so that cpexists for all p ∈ P (Geiger, 2002, 2008). For a > 0, let Xa= aX and pa(Xa= ax) = p(X = x) so thatpa(0)=p(0),λpa=λpandλp0,a=λp0by construction, where “λpa” and “λp0,a” are obvious notations. Then,(7)U(pa)=U(p),u(pa,x)=u(p,x),p∈P,x∈Iin agreement with the equivalence (5). Eqs. (7) imply that utility preferences are invariant to positive homogeneous linear transformations of the x-axis. Respectively denoting the certainty equivalents of p± and p0 bycp±andcp0, one altogether has(8)μp−=cp−<cp0=cs=0<cp+=μp+Note thatcp±=μp±does not necessarily mean risk neutrality of p± since, in the representation p = p+λp+ p–(1 – λp), p± are degenerate risks which respectively giveμp±with probabilities λp= 1 and λp= 0. For a degenerate risk x, one always has cx= μx= x even if the associated utility function is convex or concave, that is, non-neutral.Fig. 1 shows the indifference pattern in a probability triangle Δ, Δ ⊂ P, with the verticesp1=p1−,p2=0,p3=p3+. The indifference lines are straight and intersect in a point Z outside Δ on the extended isoneutral line connecting 0 and p0. Z is uniquely determined, besides by p, by the exogenous parameters ε and s. For every p, p∈Δ, with 0 < λp< 1, there exists a unique q, q∈Δ, so that q = q± and U(p) = U(q±) ifλp><λp0. In either case,(9)μp+μp−=μq+μq−Ifλp=λp0, then q = 0. Considering (8), one also has(10)cp=cq=cq±=μq±=(1−q(0))μp±(1−p(0))Lettinga=−1/μp−, replacingμp±byaμp±in Eq. (4) and considering Eqs. (7) gives(11)U(pa)=U(p)=(1−p(0))u(p,−μp+/μp−)(−1+λpu(p,−μp+/μp−)+λp)where u(p, –1) = –1 has been used. Assume q = q+so that λq= 1, and letλp>λp0. It follows(12)U(p)=U(q+)=(1−q(0))u(q,μq+)byEq.(4)=(1−q(0))u(qa,−μq+/μq−),a=−1/μq−byEqs.(7),(11)=(1−q(0))u(pa,−μp+/μp−)byEqs.(5),(9)=(1−q(0))u(p,−μp+/μp−)byEq.(7)=(1−p(0))u(p,−μp+/μp−)cp/μp+byEq.(10)Eqs. (12) and (11) successively givecpμp+=U(p)(1−p(0))u(p,−μp+/μp−)=−1+λpu(p,−μp+/μp−)+λpFinally, Eq. (3) can be used to eliminateu(p,−μp+/μp−). After rearranging terms,(13)cp=μp+(1−ɛ)(λp−λp0)ɛ(1−λp)+(1−ɛ)(1−λp0),λp≥λp0,is obtained. Now let q = q–, with λq= 0. Analogously to the derivation of Eq. (13), one gets(14)cp=−μp−U(p)=μp(1−ɛ)(λp0−λp)ɛλp+(1−ɛ)λp0λp0≥λp.Eqs. (13) and (14) can be rewritten conjointly as(15)cp=μpf(λp0,λp)where f gives the deviation of cpfrom µp,f(λp0,λp)=(1−ɛ)(λp−λp0)(λp+(1−λp)μp−/μp+)(ɛ(1−λp)+(1−ɛ)(1−λp0)),λp≥λp0,f(λp0,λp)=(1−ɛ)(λp0−λp)(λpμp+/μp−+1−λp)(ɛλp+(1−ɛ)λp0),λp0≥λp.The initial value of x0 must be added to the right-hand side of Eq. (15) if our previous normalisation x0 = 0 is finally to be cancelled.Eq. (15) is the intended result. The right-hand side of (15) does not explicitly depend on the utility function. Rather, cpcan be directly and easily computed from p and the exogenous parameters ε, x0 and s determiningλp0. One has f(λp0, 1) = f(λp0, 0) = 1 and f(λp0, λp0) = 0. The former two cases respectively correspond to pure chance p = p+ and pure risk p = p–, in which cp= μ;p. If p persists while s resolves first with certainty (ε = 1), one has cp=cp0= 0. Conversely, if ε = 0, cpis a linear function of λp(EU limit; see Eqs. (13) and (14)). For λp=λp0, cp=cp0= 0 obtains although μp0 may not vanish. In particular, decision makers are risk averse (prone) towards p0 ifμp0> 0 (μp0< 0), and similarly for the status quo s with μs> 0 (μs< 0). Generally, risk aversion (proneness) prevails if f(λp0, λp) < 1 (f(λp0, λp) > 1). The example of Fig. 2(a) shows cpas a function of μpfor a risk averse status quo, μs> cs= 0 and, consequently,μp0>cp0= 0. It demonstrates that there may be risks with positive μpfor which cpis negative. Conversely, if his status quo is unfavourable (µs< 0,μp0< 0), the decision maker may feel forced to “gamble for resurrection” and turn risk prone (cp> μp). He thus assigns a positive cpto p even though μpis negative (Fig. 2(b), hatched area). According to Eq. (15), cpsatisfies the “positive homogeneity” conditioncp0= acp, a > 0 (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) – in agreement with Eqs. (7).Fig. 3(a) shows the typical risk-seeking (risk-averse) attitude in experimental pricing tasks for lotteries with a low (high) probability of gain (Blavatskyy & Köhler, 2009). Individuals were asked to state selling prices for binary lotteries presented to them in the experiments. The statements were subject to limited ranges of admissible prices imposed on subjects via the experimental setup. Blavatskyy and Köhler (2009) offer an explanation for the observed variability in risk attitude. It is based on a constant relative risk aversion utility function combined with a model of random risk-pricing behaviour. Fig. 3(b) suggests that the experimental results may admit an alternative, much simpler explanation in terms of Eq. (15) once the elicited median selling prices of the test lotteries are interpreted as certainty equivalents. Blavatskyy and Köhler (2009) point out the conditions under which this interpretation would be correct, and discuss the relevant literature. The method they employed in the experiment may indeed elicit the true certainty equivalents even in non-EU applications. Comparison between Fig. 3(a) and (b) suggests that the utility model behind Eq. (15) can, in principle, fit the data with some reasonable accuracy. The approximation in Fig. 3(b) has been achieved by specifying the parameters x0,λp0and ε in an ad hoc fashion for demonstration purposes.Under moderately restrictive conditions of utility independence22Of two or more real random variables, one variable is said to be utility independent of the others if the risk of change in this variable (e. g., decreased health) is assessed, in utility terms, independently of the values at which the other variables (e. g., one's economic wealth or income) are currently held.of multivariate random variables, the non-EU model of Eqs. (3) and (4) can be extended to multi-dimensional, though not necessarily monetary, risk attributes (Geiger, 2012, App. B). Let P be a convex set of simple probability distributions defined on a compact intervalI,I⊂RN,N≥1. If p is the joint finite discrete probability distribution of a random vector (X1, …, XN) inI, a certainty equivalent of p always exists (Geiger, 2012, Theorem 2). It is a real vectorcp∈Iso that (X1, …, XN) =cpobtains with certainty and U(p) = U(cp). The problem, then, is how to define the intrinsic price of p, as measured by a single real number c, and which of the Xi´s should that be, that is, take on the value c with certainty.To solve this problem, observe thatcpis no longer uniquely determined if N ≥ 2. In fact,Ican always be chosen so that, for every i ≤ N, there exists a vectorcp(i)∈I,cp(i)=(0,…,γpi,0,…), so thatγpiis the ith component ofcp(i)andU(cp(i))=U(p). To see this, put hp= U(p), and let UXibe the single-attribute utility functional associated with Xi. Then there exists a simple univariate probability distribution qXi(xi) and a real numberγqiso thathp=UXi(γqi)=U(0,…,γqi,0,…)=UXi(qXi)(Geiger, 2012, proof of Theorem 2). Putγpi=γqiandcp(i)=(0,…γpi,0,…)to satisfyU(cp(i))=U(p). For each i,γpican accordingly be defined as the intrinsic price of p, as given in the “currency” Xi. It can be converted into the other “currencies” Xj, with the respective equivalent prices γpj,U(p)=U(0,…,γpi,…,0)=U(0,…,γpj,…,0),i≤N,j≤N.In practice, theγpi's are straightforward to determine. On the utility independence assumption of the approach, U(p) has been given a multilinear representation in terms of the single-attribute utility functions uXi(pXi, xi) associated with the Xi-marginals pXiof p (Geiger, 2012, App. B). This representation allows for calculating U(p) with the use of the single-attribute utility functions of Eq. (3). Consider the case U(p) ≥ 0 first. In Eq. (3), replace p bypxiaito obtainuxi(pxiai,aiμpXi−)=uxi(pxiai,−1)=−1, whereai=−1/μpXi−>0and “μpXi−” is an obvious notation. Further let λpXi= 1 so thatpXiai=aiμpXi+=aiγpi. Eq. (3) now givesuXi(aiγpi,aiγpi)as a function ofλpXi0. Note that in the expression “uXi(aiγpi,aiγpi)” the first component continues to be reserved for the probability function variable, or degenerate probability distributionaiγpifor that matter. By Eq. (4),(16)hp=U(p)=UXi(aiγpi)=(1−pXi(0))uXi(aiγpi,aiγpi),i≤NIf hp= U(p) = 0 in Eq. (16), one trivially hasγpi=0. For U(p) > 0 one has, in our slight abuse of notation for degenerate probability distributions,pxi=γpiandγpi>0and, hence, pXi(0) = 0. In either case Eq. (16) reduces tohp=uXi(aiγpi,aiγpi). Solving this equation forλpXi0with the use of Eq. (3) givesλpXi0as an elementary algebraic function of hp. SubstitutingλpXi0forλp0in Eq. (2), lettingμp−=aiμpXi−=−1andμp+=aiμpXi+=aiγpieventually gives a simple quadratic equation forγpi. A similar elementary calculation can be done if U(p) < 0 andγpi<0, using Eq. (6).
