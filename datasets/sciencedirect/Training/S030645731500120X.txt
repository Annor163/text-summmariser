A query term re-weighting approach using document similarity

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
A query term re-weighting method to reformulate textual queries is proposed.Our approach is a local query modification method.We use the information carried by the top documents in relation to each other.Query term re-weighting can applied to short queries too.Queries which use a general vocabulary set show the least improvement.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Pseudo-relevance feedback is the basis of a category of automatic query modification techniques. Pseudo-relevance feedback methods assume the initial retrieved set of documents to be relevant. Then they use these documents to extract more relevant terms for the query or just re-weigh the user's original query. In this paper, we propose a straightforward, yet effective use of pseudo-relevance feedback method in detecting more informative query terms and re-weighting them. The query-by-query analysis of our results indicates that our method is capable of identifying the most important keywords even in short queries. Our main idea is that some of the top documents may contain a closer context to the user's information need than the others. Therefore, re-examining the similarity of those top documents and weighting this set based on their context could help in identifying and re-weighting informative query terms. Our experimental results in standard English and Persian test collections show that our method improves retrieval performance, in terms of MAP criterion, up to 7% over traditional query term re-weighting methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The traditional computer-based IR is concentrated on techniques that improve the performance of retrieval systems. Examples of such techniques are probabilistic or language modeling (Craswell, Robertson, Zaragoza, & Taylor, 2005; Zaragoza, Craswell, Taylor, Saria, & Robertson, 2004), personalized search (Croft, Cronen-Townsend, & Lavrenko, 2001; Sieg, Mobasher, & Burke, 2007), query classification (Kang & Kim, 2003), and query modification (Lavrenko & Croft, 2001; Lee, Croft, & Allan, 2008). Query modification techniques are a group of models that try to improve the retrieval performance by improving the original user query. There are two main classes of query modification methods. The first class is called query expansion in which the system reformulates the user query (Lavrenko & Croft, 2001; Lee, Croft, & Allan, 2008) by adding extra terms and re-weighting the query terms. The second class however, concentrates only on re-weighting the query terms (Bendersky & Croft, 2008; Robertson & Jones, 1976).In this paper, we propose an approach to query modification through query term re-weighting. We use automatic feedback to retrieve the first set of relevant documents, and then we extract the information which is needed for assigning a meaningful weight to each query term. Our experimental results in English and Persian languages indicate that our method outperforms traditional query term re-weighting approaches.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the related studies. Section 3 presents our approach to query term re-weighting in detail. Section 4 reports our results, i.e., Section 4.1 explains our experimental setup, Sections 4.2 and 4.3 present our results in English and Persian data sets, and Section 4.4 discusses the method. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we proposed a straightforward approach to query term re-weighting. Our approach uses the initial query to first retrieve a set of documents; then it weights each document based on its closeness to the user's information need. These weights are used in the recalculation of query term weights. Our approach improves the retrieval performance, in terms of MAP criterion, by 7% over language modeling approach in three data sets. It also outperforms other query term re-weighting approaches such as WIG term weighting model. We believe more sophisticated weighting methods can help to achieve even further improvements. Therefore, in the future we try to look into various probabilistic frameworks to achieve better results.
