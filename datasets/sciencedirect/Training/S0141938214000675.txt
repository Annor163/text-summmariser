@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A series of Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 phosphors were synthesized by high temperature solid state reaction. Recorded XRD patterns proved that the titled compound in a single phase has been obtained. Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 could emit orange and white light, respectively. The optimal doping concentration of Sm3+ or Dy3+ was experimentally ascertained to be 6mol%. The critical distance of energy transfer for Sm3+ or Dy3+ doped sample is 1.540nm. In addition, there is no cross energy transfer between the Sm3+ and Dy3+ ions in the co-doped samples. The results indicated that the electric dipole–dipole interaction is predominant energy transfer mechanism for concentration quenching of Sm3+ or Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 phosphor. The charge transfer band was observed in the excitation spectra of Sm3+ or Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 phosphors. Present investigation indicated that Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 can be applied in solid state lighting and LaBWO6 is a promising host for display applications.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Luminescent materials have obtained extensively applications for a long period due to their ability to convert electromagnetic radiation (i.e., ultraviolet (UV) and infrared light) into visible light [1–2]. Especially, phosphors based on rare earth (RE) ions doped borates or tungstates have attracted continuing attention due to their interesting photoluminescence wavelengths extending from the UV to the infrared [3–7]. The practical potential of these materials is mostly associated with the structural characteristics of the boron- or tungstate-oxygen groups [5]. Molybdates and tungstates with scheelite structure are considered as good host lattices under near-UV or blue light excitation due to their MoO4 tetrahedron and WO4 unit [2]. Zheng et al. reported the emissions and photocatalytic selectivity of SrWO4:Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+) prepared by a supersonic microwave co-assistance method and discussed the energy migration occurs from WO42− to the doped rare earth ions [8]. Novel red-emitting Eu3+-activated La2−xGdx(MoO4)3−y(WO4)yphosphors with well-defined one-dimensional nanostructures were synthesized via a supersonic microwave co-assistance method for the first time at very low temperature by Huo et al. [9]. Eu3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+-doped boro-molybdates phosphors have been investigated by Zhang and Seo [2] and Zhang et al. [10]. Recently, LaBWO6 as a promising host for luminescence applications has been prepared by Pechini method and the luminescence properties of the Eu3+ doped LaBWO6 were reported by Huang et al. [5]. LaBWO6 of tungsten borate compounds was first discovered in 1979 by Palkina et al. [11]. Aleksandrov et al. found the crystallization of LaBWO6 when they studied WO3-B2O3-La2O3 glasses [12]. Based on the pseudo-ternary phase diagram of LaBWO6−(Li2WO4/LiF)−B2O3, the LaBWO6 crystals have been firstly grown by the flux method [13]. Currently, LaBWO6 as the host for rare earth doped luminescent materials was rarely reported in literature. To the best of our knowledge, the luminescence properties of Sm3+ and Dy3+ in LaBWO6 have not been reported till now. In this work Sm3+ and Dy3+ doped LaBWO6 were prepared by high temperature solid state reaction and their luminescence properties were investigated in detail. The present investigation results indicate that LaBWO6 is an excellent host for luminescence applications.The powder samples of La1−xSmxBWO6 and La1−xDyxBWO6 phosphors were prepared by the solid-state technique. The starting materials were La2O3 (99%), H3BO3 (99%), WO3 (99%), Sm2O3 (99.9%) and Dy2O3 (99.99%). The stoichiometric amounts of the starting materials were weighted accurately according to the following chemical reaction equations:(1)xSm2O3+(1-x)La2O3+2H3BO3+2WO3=2La(1-x)SmxBWO6+3H2O(2)xDy2O3+(1-x)La2O3+2H3BO3+2WO3=2La(1-x)DyxBWO6+3H2OIn order to investigate the luminescence mechanism, the Sm3+ and Dy3+ co-doped LaBWO6 phosphor was also prepared according to the following reaction equation:(3)xSm2O3+xDy2O3+(1-2x)La2O3+2H3BO3+2WO3=2La(1-2x)DyxSmxBWO6+3H2Owhere, x=0.06.Considering the evaporation of H3BO3 during the solid-state reaction, 10wt.% excess amount of H3BO3 was added to compensate the evaporating loss. All raw materials were mixed homogeneously in an agate mortar. The homogeneous mixture was put into a corundum crucible and sintered at 980°C in air for 10h. Then, the samples were cooled to room temperature in the furnace, and grounded again into powder.The structures of the phosphors were investigated by an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, Beijing MSAL-XD-2) with Cu Ka radiation (λ=0.15406nm) at 36kV tube voltage and 20mA tube current. The patterns in 2θ were from 10 to 70°. The excitation and emission spectra were measured by a Hitachi F-7000 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer at room temperature.
