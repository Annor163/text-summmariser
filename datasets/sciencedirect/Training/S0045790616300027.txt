@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we consider the performance of a cellular uplink (UL) multi-user feedback multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by joint transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) design and polarization-multiplexing (PM). PM is realized with the aid of dual and triply-polarized antennas. At the transmitter, we take advantage of only the individual user’s channel impulse responses (CIRs) obtained through feedback channels that endure noise, fading and delay to construct the preprocessing matrix, while at the receiver the post-processing matrix construction relies on the perfect CIRs of all the users. In multi-user UL-MIMO transmissions, multiple-access interference (MAI) and inter-antenna interference (IAI) can severely degrade the system’s performance. Our study shows that the joint Tx-Rx is capable of completely eliminating the IAI as well as the MAI when it employs perfect CIRs based preprocessing and post-processing. On the other hand, noise, fading and delay tainted quantized-CIRs based preprocessing results in noticeable performance degradation due to imperfect removal of IAI. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that, when the preprocessing is based on the quantized-CIRs obtained through ideal feedback channels, the resultant achievable symbol-error-rate and sum-capacity remain close to that obtained with the perfect CIRs based design.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems that use multiple antennas at the transmitters and receivers have been one of the most actively researched areas in the context of wireless communications. A plethora of work in MIMO wireless systems and the results have led to lots of intermediate applications. The two most important benefits of MIMO systems are as follows: First, a significant enhancement in both the system’s capacity in addition to spectral efficiency can be achieved, i.e., the capacity of a wireless link swells linearly with the minimum of the number of antennas at the transmit or receive side. Further, the data rate can be increased by delivering parallel data streams through spatial multiplexing without calling for additional frequency resources and total transmit power. Second, a significant reduction of the effects of fading can be attained by increased diversity. This is on the whole advantageous when the different channels fade independently [1,2]. To be specific, space-time coding can be employed to encode the data stream spatially across all the transmitting antennas. The resulting diversity gain can be exploited to improve the reliability of the wireless links.By and large, the performance of the MIMO systems either in spatial multiplexing or transmit diversity mode relies to a great extent on the overall MIMO channel attributes, which are in turn functions of transmit and receive antennas heights, spacing and scattering [3]. Usually, antenna spacing of the order of tens of wavelength and up to a wavelength is required at the base station (BS) and mobile station (MS), respectively, to attain substantial multiplexing or diversity gain [3]. Alas, this requirement increases the size as well as the cost of the BS. Moreover, the use of more number of antennas (usually in excess of four) at the MS is not practically feasible owing to size and energy constrictions. As a design choice and to get round the aforesaid limitations, dual or triply-polarized antennas can be exploited as they can lift the cost and space constrictions inflicted by unipolarized antennas. In a dual and triply-polarized antenna aided system, a single antenna that employs orthogonal polarizations [3,4] can replace two and three spatially separated unipolarized antennas, respectively. Further, dual or triply-polarized transmissions involve concurrent transmission of two or three independent signals with the aid of orthogonal polarizations. Nevertheless, in the context of a uplink (UL) system exploiting dual or triply-polarized antennas for conceiving polarization-multiplexing (PM) by creating orthogonally polarized transmissions, reflections, scattering and diffraction can cause the electromagnetic waves propagating through the environment to endure depolarization. Furthermore, imperfection in transmit and receive antennas and change in the polarization state of the transmitted signals due to channel anisotropy and polarization orthogonality loss can considerably degrade the performance of the system in terms of the achievable error-rate or capacity.In the open literature, performance of the dual or triply-polarized MIMO communication has been investigated for a single user scenario to achieve either spatial multiplexing or transmit diversity. The performance of such a system for a multi-user UL communication has received little attention. Furthermore, in a multi-user MIMO-UL transmission, inter-antenna interference (IAI) and multiple-access interference (MAI) can further degrade the system performance. The effects of IAI and MAI can be suppressed by calling upon the optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver [5]. But, it introduces excessive complexity in signal detection which precludes its use even at the BS, where higher complexity is tolerable. As a design choice, transmitter preprocessing (TP) and receiver side post-processing can be employed [6–8] to suppress the effects of IAI and MAI, respectively.The performance of the preprocessing techniques for systems aided by unipolarized antenna configuration have been widely addressed in the literature in the context of time division duplex (TDD) type wireless systems [2,6–10]. This is because in a TDD type system, the channel knowledge that is needed to formulate the preprocessing matrix at the BS for downlink (DL) communication can be obtained from the UL channels while the channel knowledge that is required to construct the preprocessing matrix at the MS for UL communication can be acquired from the DL channels due to the channel reciprocity exhibited by such systems. By contrast, in a frequency division duplex (FDD) type system, reciprocity cannot be employed, at least not in connection with the small-scale fading characteristics caused by the multipath propagation. This is because, in practice the frequency separation between the UL and DL channels is usually larger than the channel’s coherence bandwidth. Consequently, in FDD type wireless systems, the channel impulse responses (CIRs) needed to conceive the preprocessing matrix have to be estimated by the receiver and feedback the estimated CIRs via feedback channels to the transmitter. Therefore, investigating the performance of the preprocessing in wireless systems that employ FDD is more exacting in comparison to its TDD counterpart. Further, to the best of our knowledge, in the open literature, the performance of PM combined with preprocessing has not been explored for a FDD type multi-user UL wireless system with limited feedback constraints where IAI and MAI are the dominant channel impairments.Contributions: In this paper, the performance of an uncoded spatial multiplexing in a system employing dual and triply-polarized antennas is investigated. Specifically, the performance is investigated in terms of the achievable symbol-error-rate (SER) and sum-capacity with the aid of a joint Tx-Rx design for a UL multi-user feedback MIMO transmission employing dual and triply-polarized antennas. The joint Tx-Rx design involves the construction of preprocessing and post-processing. CIRs are paramount in the preprocessing construction. If the preprocessing is to perfectly eliminate the interference and yield optimum performance, perfect availability of the CIRs is required at the transmitter at the instant of transmission. However, in practice, CIRs can be imperfect owing to estimation errors, feedback errors and feedback delays. Preprocessing design that does not take into consideration the uncertainties in the CIRs will not reflect the actual performance in the presence of the aforementioned imperfections. Therefore, against this background, in this contribution, singular-value decomposition (SVD) based joint transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) design is investigated for a UL multi-user feedback MIMO system aided by PM in the presence of feedback errors and feedback delays. To precis, the contributions of our work are as follows.•First, we present the channel models for communication milieus that employ dual and triply-polarized antennas by taking into consideration the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD).Second, we demonstrate that, when SVD-based joint Tx-Rx design, i.e, preprocessing and post-processing are used assuming the CIRs of the individual user is perfectly available at the MS and all the users’ CIRs at the BS at the moment of transmission and reception, respectively, the effects of both the IAI and MUI can be efficiently suppressed in the UL transmission.Third, we investigate the achievable SER and sum-capacity, when the joint Tx-Rx is designed using the preprocessing constructed with the quantized-CIRs knowledge (Note: Here, it refers to quantized-CIR matrix constructed at the MSs with the aid of the codebook indices that correspond to the codewords of the quantized channel vectors stored at the BS, which are acquired via feedback channels. Note, furthermore, that, wherever we refer to quantized-CIRs knowledge being contaminated, it means the bits representing the integers that correspond to the vector-quantized (VQ) codebook indices which are utilized to construct the CIR matrix at the MSs are being contaminated, as we feedback only the bits corresponding to the integers of the codebook indices and not the actual VQ-CIRs. Consequently, when these codebook indices corrupted by noise, fading and delay, are utilized to construct the VQ-CIR matrix, it may diverge significantly from the VQ-CIR matrix for which the codebook indices were fed back. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate the impact of the codebook indices inaccuracy imposed by noise, fading and delay on the VQ-CIRs construction as well as the SER and sum-capacity performance of the considered system when aided by the preprocessing matrix based on these VQ-CIRs.) obtained with the aid of ideal feedback channels and the post-processing with the perfect CIRs. We also investigate the attainable SER and sum-capacity when the joint Tx-Rx design is based on the preprocessing devised with the aid of the quantized-CIRs knowledge contaminated by noise and fading and the post-processing based on perfect CIRs.Finally, we study the delay-limited performance of the considered system, i.e., the joint Tx-Rx design aided by the preprocessing based on the outdated CIRs knowledge to characterize the achievable SER.Organization of the paper: The rest of the paper is organized as follows; Section II describes the channel models and system model of a dual and triply-polarized UL transmission with TP. Section III describes the power allocation regime employed in our contribution, Section IV describes the vector quantization and Section V provides the performance results. Finally, in Section VI we draw the conclusion of our work.Let us assume that the channelHconnecting the transmit and receive antennas be modeled as a Ricean fading channel. In this context,Hcan be decomposed into a fixed matrix and a random matrix as(1)H=κκ+1H¨+1κ+1H˜where κ represents the Ricean κ-factor [3]. The random matrixH˜is composed of elements which are correlated zero mean unit variance complex Gaussian random variables.For a dual-polarized system the channel matrix is generally modeled in terms of the vertical and horizontal polarizations. Specifically, the entries ofHdenote the input-output relation from vertical to vertical, vertical to horizontal, horizontal to horizontal and horizontal to vertically polarized waves, i.e., the channel matrix for a single dual-polarized antenna both at the BS and MS can be modeled with the aid of Fig. 1as [4](2)H¯¯dp=[h˜vvh˜vhh˜hvh˜hh]For a dual-polarized antenna structure, the ability to separate the vertical and horizontal polarizations is given by the XPD factor which is directly related to the random component of the channel. XPD characterizes the amount of leakage from one polarization to another introduced by the channel [3]. Further, it is now well known that when the electromagnetic waves traverse through the medium, they may endure change in polarization due to reflections. Furthermore, experimental studies have shown that scattering can change the polarization states even if we employ antennas with good XPDs [4]. The XPD factor for the variable component of the channel can be defined as [3](3)XPDv=E{|h˜vv|2}E{|h˜hv|2},XPDh=E{|h˜hh|2}E{|h˜vh|2}Here, we assume a symmetric leakage as in [4]. Now, defining α, 0 < α ≤ 1, as the parameter that denotes a portion of the radiated power that couples from vertical to horizontal and from horizontal to vertical polarization, ideal discrimination between the vertical and horizontal polarization is possible when α → 0 and a leakage between polarizations occurs when 0 < α ≤ 1. Therefore, XPD and α can be related as(4)XPD=1−αα,0<α≤1The above expression is arrived at by using the following normalizations(5)E{|h˜vv|2}=E{|h˜hh|2}=1−αE{|h˜hv|2}=E{|h˜vh|2}=αSuppose, if we have two dual-polarized antennas at the transmitter and two MSs each equipped with one dual-polarized antenna, then with respect to the first dual-polarized antenna at the BS, the XPDs between the vertically polarized antenna and the horizontally polarized antennas at the receivers of both the MSs can be expressed as [4](6)XPD1h1v=E{|h˜1v1v|2}E{|h˜1h1v|2},XPD2h1v=E{|h˜1v1v|2}E{|h˜2h1v|2}respectively. Similarly, the XPDs between the horizontally polarized antenna and the vertically polarized antennas at the receivers of the two MSs can be expressed as(7)XPD1v1h=E{|h˜1h1h|2}E{|h˜1v1h|2},XPD2v1h=E{|h˜1h1h|2}E{|h˜2v1h|2}Next, the XPD for the fixed component matrix of the dual-polarized channel can be given as follows.(8)XPDf=1−αfαf,0<αf≤1The above XPDfis based on the following normalizations(9)|h¨vv|2=|h¨hh|2=1−αf(10)|h¨hv|2=|h¨vh|2=αfGenerally, when a multi-antenna signaling approach is exploited, the elements of spatially separated uni-polarized channel matrix will be correlated when the spacing between the antennas is too small and when the channels are not exhibiting rich scattering. Hence, to correlate the elements of the random matrix of (1), we adopt the following method as used in [2](11)H˜=Rrx1/2HiidRtx1/2whereRrxis the receive correlation matrix andRtxrepresents the transmit correlation matrix.Hiidis a matrix whose entries are assumed to be independent zero mean complex Gaussian random variables with unit variance.RrxandRtxare given by(12)Rrx=[1ρrx12...ρrx1Nb⋮ρrxNb1ρrxNb2...1]Rtx=[1ρtx12...ρtx1Nk⋮ρtxNk1ρtxNk2...1]where ρtxijis a complex correlation coefficient between ith and jth transmitting antennas while ρrxijis a complex correlation coefficient between ith and jth receiving antennas. Further, Nkand Nbdenote the number of antennas employed by each of the MSs and BS, respectively. Then with the aid of (2) and (12), it can be readily shown that the dual-polarized (2 × 2) MIMO channel can be expressed as(13)H¯dp=Ωdp⊙(Rrx1/2H¯¯dpRtx1/2)where(14)Ωdp=[1−ααα1−α]denotes the polarization leakage matrix. Further, ⊙ stands for Hadamard product. Now, without loss of generality, the MIMO channel matrix for an extension to arrays of several spatially separated dual-polarized antennas can be readily expressed as [4](15)H¯dp=1Nb/2×Nk/2⊗Ωdp⊙(Rrx1/2H¯¯dpNb×NkRtx1/2)Furthermore,H¯dpin (13) and (15) represents the MIMO channel matrix for dual-polarized communication with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) components under the assumptionκ=0in (1).In case if the BS and MSs use triply-polarized antennas then based on Fig. 2, the channel matrix can be expressed as(16)H¯¯tp=[h˜vvh˜vhh˜vzh˜hvh˜hhh˜hzh˜zvh˜zhh˜zz]Then, with the aid of (16), the XPDs for the triply-polarized antenna configurations take the following definition(17)XPDvh=E{|h˜vv|2}E{|h˜hv|2},XPDhv=E{|h˜hh|2}E{|h˜vh|2}XPDzv=E{|h˜zz|2}E{|h˜vz|2},XPDvz=E{|h˜vv|2}E{|h˜zv|2}XPDhz=E{|h˜hh|2}E{|h˜zh|2},XPDzh=E{|h˜zz|2}E{|h˜hz|2}Similar to the dual polarized case, here too we assume a symmetric leakage [4]. Hence, in this context, we define the following normalizations for the triply-polarized antennas(18)E{|h˜vv|2}=E{|h˜hh|2}=E{|h˜zz|2}=1−(α1+α2)(19)E{|h˜vh|2}=E{|h˜zv|2}=E{|h˜hz|2}=α1(20)E{|h˜hv|2}=E{|h˜vz|2}=E{|h˜zh|2}=α2The above-mentioned normalizations hold paramount importance for the triply-polarized antenna configurations, since the XPD can be represented with the aid of them as(21)XPD=1−(α1+α2)α1+α2,0<(α1+α2)≤1Next, the XPD for the fixed component matrix of the triply-polarized channel can be expressed as(22)XPDf=1−(α1f+α2f)α1f+α2f,0<(α1f+α2f)≤1with the following normalizations(23)|h¨vv|2=|h¨hh|2=|h¨zz|2=1−(α1f+α2f)(24)|h¨vh|2=|h¨zv|2=|h¨hz|2=α1f(25)|h¨hv|2=|h¨vz|2=|h¨zh|2=α2fNow, with the aid of (16), the triply-polarized (3 × 3) MIMO channel matrix can be expressed as(26)H¯tp=Ωtp⊙(Rrx1/2H¯¯tpRtx1/2)where(27)Ωtp=[1−βα1α2α21−βα1α1α21−β]denotes the polarization leakage matrix withβ=(α1+α2),0 ≤ β ≤ 1 defining the condition for symmetry. Further, in (26)RrxandRtxare the receive and transmit correlation matrices, respectively, which are based on (12). Akin to the dual-polarized antenna configurations, here also extension to the arrays of many spatially separated triply-polarized antennas can be easily generalized with the following expression [4],(28)H¯tp=1Nb/3×Nk/3⊗Ωtp⊙(Rrx1/2H¯¯tpNb×NkRtx1/2)Further, in (26) and (28),H¯tprepresents the MIMO channel matrix for triply-polarized communication with NLOS components. Note, furthermore, that, Nband Nkin (15) should invariably be in multiples of two, whereas, in (28) they should always be in multiples of three.In this section, let us consider an UL transmission with the BS capable of supporting K MSs that are randomly distributed in a single cell system. Fig. 3illustrates the scenario associated with a typical UL transmission. Here, each of the K MSs employs Nkdual-polarized transmit antennas and that the BS employs Nbdual-polarized receive antennas. The joint transmitter-receiver design implemented in the considered UL transmission is as follows; the preprocessing is conceived by exploiting only the individual user’s CIRs to purge the IAI, whereas the post-processing relies on all the users’ CIRs to deal with the removal of MAI.Let the preprocessing matrix be denoted byP¯k,k=1,2,...,Kand the post-processing matrix exploited at the BS receiver for MAI mitigation be given byG¯. Further, letd¯k=[d¯k1,d¯k2,...,d¯kNk]Tbe a 2Nk-length symbol vector that will be transmitted to the BS by the kth MS. This symbol vector will be preprocessed by the kth MS before transmission, yielding(29)x¯k=P¯kd¯kFurthermore, the (2Nb× 2Nk) component CIR matrix that connects the Nkdual-polarized transmit antennas of the kth user and the Nbdual-polarized receive antennas of the BS can be given by(30)H¯kdp=1Nb/2×Nk/2⊗Ωdp⊙(Rrx1/2H¯¯dpNb×NkRtx1/2)whereH¯¯kdp=[h˜1v1vh˜1v1h...h˜1vNkhh˜1h1vh˜1h1h...h˜1hNkhh˜2v1vh˜2v1h...h˜2vNkhh˜2h1vh˜2h1h...h˜2hNkh⋮h˜Nbv1vh˜Nbv1h...h˜NbvNkhh˜Nbh1vh˜Nbh1h...h˜NbhNkh],k=1,2,...,KNow, the 2Nb-length received vector at the BS can be given by(31)r¯=∑k=1KH¯kdpx¯k+n¯=∑k=1KH¯kdpP¯kd¯k+n¯wheren¯is a 2Nb-dimensional component noise vector with its entries assuming Gaussian distribution with mean zero and a covariance matrixE[n¯n¯H]=σ2I2Nb. Assuming, perfect CIRs knowledge at the kth MS, SVD onH¯kdpyields(32)H¯kdp=U¯kdp[Σ¯kdp,s1/20]V¯kdpH=[U¯kdp,sU¯kdp,n]︸U¯kdp[Σ¯kdp,s1/20]V¯kdpH=U¯kdp,sΣ¯kdp,s1/2V¯kdpHwhereU¯kdpandV¯kdpare (2Nb× 2Nb) and (2Nk× 2Nk) unitary matrices,Σ¯kdp,srepresents the (2Nk× 2Nk) diagonal matrix that comprises the eigenvalues ofH¯kdpH¯kdpH,U¯kdp,sis a (2Nb× 2Nk) component matrix comprising the eigenvectors that corresponds to the non-zero eigenvalues ofH¯kdpHH¯kdpandU¯kdp,nis a[2Nb×(2Nb−2Nk)]matrix that comprises the eigenvectors that corresponds to the zero eigenvalues ofH¯kdpHH¯kdp. In order to ensure that the signal space is non-empty and that for the post-processing matrix to perfectly cancel the multiple access interference, the necessary condition can be specified as follows.Lemma 1In order to ensure that the signal space is non-empty and that for the post-processing to perfectly eliminate the multiple access interference, the necessary condition is that the columns ofHkhave full rank, i.e.,rank(Hk)=Nk,which implies column-rank full and that we have Nb≥ KNk.Now, substituting (32) in (31), the received vector at the BS can be given by [9,10](33)r¯=∑k=1KU¯kdp,sΣ¯kdp,s1/2V¯kdpHP¯kd¯k+n¯LetP¯k=V¯kdpγ¯kdefines the preprocessing matrix of the kth user [9,10]. Here,γ¯kis a (2Nk× 2Nk) dimensional diagonal matrix that constitutes the power normalization coefficients employed for maintaining constant transmission power. ExploitingP¯kin (33) and based on the property thatV¯kdpHV¯kdp=I2Nk,the received vector of (33) can be simplified as(34)r¯=∑k=1KU¯kdp,sΣ¯kdp,s1/2γ¯kd¯k+n¯Explicitly, with the aid of the above expression, the UL received vector at the BS for K UL users can be readily given by(35)r¯=U¯dp,sΣ¯dp,s1/2γ¯d¯+n¯whereby definition,U¯dp,s=[U¯1dp,s,U¯2dp,s,...,U¯Kdp,s]Σ¯dp,s1/2=diag[Σ¯1dp,s1/2,Σ¯2dp,s1/2,...,Σ¯Kdp,s1/2](36)d¯=[d¯1T,d¯2T,...,d¯KT]TFrom (34) or (35), it may be noted that the preprocessing matrix completely eliminates the cross-polarized interference and IAI. This is because the columns ofU¯kdp,sof each of the UL users are orthogonal. However, the columns ofU¯dp,sthat correspond to different UL users are non-orthogonal, suggesting the presence of MAI. This MAI should be eliminated at the BS. In this context, the post-processing matrix that is required at the BS to perfectly eliminate the MAI can be devised as [9,10](37)G¯=(U¯dp,s)−1Let us defined¯^=G¯r¯,whered¯^denotes the estimated symbols of all the K UL users. Now, substituting (35) ind¯^,we arrive at(38)d¯^=G¯(U¯dp,sΣ¯dp,s1/2γ¯d¯+n¯)Upon substituting (37) in the above expression, the estimates of all the K UL users at the BS can be expressed as(39)d¯^=Σ¯dp,s1/2γ¯d¯+n^wheren^=G¯n¯. From the above expression, it can be observed that the post-processing matrix completely eliminates the MAI. Specifically, the kth user’s decision variables can be readily given by(40)d¯^k=Σ¯kdp,s1/2γ¯kd¯k+n^kSuppose, if the BS and the MSs are equipped with triply-polarized antennas then with the aid of (28) and (32), the preprocessing and post-processing matrices can be readily arrived at, similar to the dual-polarized UL communication discourse.In an UL communication, the transmission power of the kth user’s MS should remain constant, i.e., after preprocessing, the transmission power should not exceed the originally assigned power. Hence, to maintain a constant transmission power, the power allocation is realized under the following constraint [9–11](41)E[∥P¯kd¯k∥2]≤E[∥d¯k∥2]=2NkAssumingE[d¯kd¯kH]=I2Nk,we have(42)trace(P¯kP¯kH)≤2NkNow, in the context of the kth MS, the maximum achievable rate that is normalized by the number of transmit antennas corresponding to the kth MS can be given by [10–11](43)I¯^max(d¯^k,d¯k)=12Nk∑i=12Nklog2[1+Σ¯kiσ2γ¯ki2]In (43),γ¯ki,i=1,2,...,2Nk,k=1,2,...,Kcan be formulated with the aid of ‘water-filling’ principle, under the constraint of (42). Specifically,γ¯kiaccording to the water-filling principle is given by(44)γ¯ki2=(vk−σ2Σ¯ki)†,i=1,2,...,2NkIn (44),(·)†=max(·,0)gives the maximum of the argument. Further, vkis chosen such that(45)∑i=12Nkvkiγ¯ki2≤2NkThe capacity in (43) gives the maximum information rate only when ideal channel knowledge is employed at the kth MS to carry out the preprocessing. Further, the capacity in (43) is arrived at based on the assumption of uncorrelated noise samples at the BS. However, due to the post-processing operation, the noise samples get correlated. Consequently, the covariance matrix of noise can be expressed as [9,10](46)E[n^n^H]=σ2U¯dp,sU¯dp,sHHence, the maximum achievable rate normalized by 2Nkis given by(47)I¯^max(d¯^k,d¯k)=12Nklog2[I2Nk+Σ¯kdp,sγ¯k2Rk−1]whereRk=E[n^n^H]. Suppose, if the UL communication exploits triply-polarized antennas, then the normalized maximum achievable mutual information rate with respect to the kth MS can be given by(48)I¯^max(d¯^k,d¯k)=13Nk∑i=13Nklog2[1+Σ¯kiσ2γ¯ki2]where,γ¯ki2=(vk−σ2Σ¯ki)†,i=1,2,...,3Nk. Further, if the noise samples get correlated, then the maximum achievable rate normalized by 3Nkis given by(49)I¯^max(d¯^k,d¯k)=13Nklog2[I3Nk+Σ¯kdp,sγ¯k2Rk−1]Furthermore, the normalized maximum information rate in (47) and (49) can be achieved as long as the BS is capable of employing the knowledge ofRkto detect the kth user’s symbols.The computation complexity for the preprocessing matrix formulation in the context of the UL communication is tabulated in Table 1[12]. Furthermore, the detection complexity in detecting a user’s symbol in the context of the dual and triply-polarized UL communications isO{(2Nb)2} andO{(3Nb)2}, respectively.As mentioned earlier, the CIRs knowledge is crucial at the transmitter for formulating the preprocessing matrix. Since, we presuppose a UL multi-user feedback MIMO system, the BS receiver should estimate the CIRs of each of the UL users and communicate its knowledge to the MSs’ transmitters through feedback channels. Consequently, at the BS, we ideally estimate the CIRs by invoking pilot aided channel estimation method. The magnitudes and phases of the estimated CIRs are then vector-quantized (VQ) and the codebook indices are conveyed to the MSs for devising the preprocessing matrix. The channels that carry the channel knowledge from the BS to MSs are assumed to endure noise, fading and delay. In the subsequent discourse we describe the VQ process.Let{φ¯n}denote the source vector that has to be quantized. Here, the source vector{φ¯n}that comprises the amplitudes or phases of the UL-CIRs be modeled as a stationary and ergodic process with zero mean. Further, let us assume that{φ¯n}be real and continuous and be associated with an hyperspaceR¯Nof dimension N, i.e., we have{φ¯n}∈R¯N. In this context, the VQ encoder [13,14] performs the mapping operation to map{φ¯n}to a finite precision modelQ¯n∈Q¯M. Here,Q¯M={0,1,2,...,M−1}represents the M number of VQ centriods i.e.Q¯n=Φ(φ¯n). Consequently, the mapping function of the considered VQ encoder can be denoted asΦ:R¯N⟶Q¯M. Now, representing the CIRs hyperspace byR¯i=0M−1,it can be stated that each partition will have a VQ encoded centriod{cb¯i}i=0M−1so that we havecb¯i≅E(φ¯n|Q¯n=i)=E(φ¯n|φ¯n∈R¯i). Subsequently, each unquantized source will be connected to the ith cell or region by the VQ encoder asφ¯i∈R¯i⇒Q¯n=i. Here, i represents the index that corresponds to the VQ encoded centroid{cb¯i}i=0M−1. Therefore, in the VQ codebook there will be M VQ encoded centroids or codewords{cb¯i}i=0M−1.Next, let us generate a large number of ϑ data samplesZ¯=[φ¯1,φ¯2,...,φ¯ϑ]. Then, setj=1and randomly choose M values from the data setZ¯to form the initial codebook which can be given asCB¯j=[cb¯0j,cb¯1j,cb¯2j,...,cb¯M−1j]. In our work, we carry out the codebooks generation and updation by calling upon the classical Lloyd’s algorithm [14] detailed in Table 2. In the Table 2, d(., .) returns the Euclidean distance between the arguments.In our work we vector quantize the phases and amplitudes separately. This is because, amplitudes and phases are differently distributed [13], i.e., amplitudes are Rayleigh distributed whilst the phases are uniformly distributed. Therefore, in this contribution we vector quantize the phases and amplitudes by using two vectors. Now, letb¯ℓ(i),ℓ=0,1,2,...,N−1denote the bits representing the integer that corresponds to the index of the VQ codebooki∈Q¯M. The observation forb¯ℓ(i)at the MS’s receiver when it is transmitted from the BS through a feedback channel that experiences noise and fading can be given by(50)r¯ℓf(i)=h¯ℓfb¯ℓ(i)+n¯ℓf,ℓ=0,1,2,N−1whereh¯ℓfrepresents the feedback channel gain which is assumed to follow Rayleigh distribution andn¯ℓfdenotes the Gaussian distributed noise with zero mean and a variance σ2. Suppose, if the phase associated with a particular channel gain is available at the MS’s receiver, then using this phase informationr¯ℓf(i)in (50) can be written as(51)r¯ℓf(i)=|h¯ℓf|b¯ℓ(i)+n¯ℓf,ℓ=0,1,2,N−1Now, the CIRs knowledge of the MIMO channel received at each of the MSs is recovered by using minimum-mean-square-error detector. Then, based on the observations ofr¯ℓf,ℓ=0,1,2,N−1,{φ¯^n}of{φ¯n}forms the estimates of either the phases or amplitudes of the CIRs connecting the BS and MSs.In the above exposition, we assumed that the feedback channels experience zero feedback delay. However, in practice the feedback channels will endure delay and hence, the recovered CIRs would be outdated. Therefore, to characterize the outdated CIRs, the temporal variations of the channels can be modeled with the aid of first order Markov process [15](52)H¯(t)=ϱH¯(t−τ)+1−ϱ2ℵ¯(t)where, ϱ is the temporal correlation coefficient while τ denotes the delay that includes signal processing, feedback and other system delays. The innovation termℵ¯has independent complex Gaussian distributed entries with zero mean and unit variance i.e.,ℵ¯j,i∼CN(0,1). For notation convenience, let us drop the time index in (52). Therefore, we have(53)H¯=ϱHˇ¯+1−ϱ2ℵ¯whereHˇ¯denotes the outdated channel matrix as a result of the feedback delay andH¯represents true channel matrix. The correlation coefficient ϱ in the above expression can be related to the delay τ by adopting the Jakes’ model [16]. Hence, we haveϱ=J0(2πfdτ)where, J0(.) is the zeroth order Bessel function of the first kind whilst fdis the Doppler frequency shift. The temporal correlation is determined by the product fdτ which is referred to as normalized Doppler frequency.In this section, we provide a gamut of simulation results to characterize the achievable SER performance of a joint Tx-Rx design-assisted dual and triply-polarized UL multi-user feedback MIMO system when communicating over correlated fading channels. The modulation format considered in this work is 64 QAM. Further, we assume that the BS employs 10 dual or triply-polarized antennas and that each of the MSs use one dual or triply-polarized antenna. Furthermore, the fading coefficients connecting the BS and the MSs are derived with the aid of (1), (15) and (28) withκ=0in (1), which represents a typical Rayleigh channel that describes the worst case scenario. We also assumeK=8,10,α=0.2,α1=α2=0.1andρtx=ρrx=0.4[17] in our simulation. The codebook size considered in our simulations is 1024 that corresponds to a feedback budget of 10 bits.Fig. 4shows the SER versus SNR comparison of the considered dual-polarized UL-MIMO system with that of the system employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) based multi-user detector (MUD) [18], when communicating over the fading channels that are correlated. Here, the joint Tx-Rx design is based on the perfect CIRs assumption. From the results of Fig. 4, it is seen that the system aided by the joint Tx-Rx design results in better achievable SER. Further, it can be inferred that when the number of users increases, the performance slightly degrades. Although the performance degrades slightly, the considered joint Tx-Rx design outperforms the SIC-MUD(K=8)in terms of the attainable SER.In Figs. 5and 6, we demonstrate the SER as a function of SNR performance for the dual and triply polarized UL communications, respectively, by invoking the preprocessing matrixP¯k. Figs. 5 and 6 provide the comparison for perfect CIRs knowledge, ideal feedback of VQ-CIRs knowledge and noise and fading tainted VQ-CIRs knowledge based preprocessing matrix aided UL communication. From the figures, we may notice that when the VQ-CIRs knowledge contaminated by noise as well as fading are used to formulate the preprocessing matrix, performance degrades considerably. However, when the VQ-CIRs knowledge corrupted by noise alone is employed for the preprocessing matrix construction, the SER performance of the considered systems improves. Further, in both the above-mentioned cases, performance degradation is due to the imperfect removal of IAI by the preprocessing matrix. By contrast, when the VQ-CIRs knowledge acquired through ideal feedback channels is exploited for constructing the preprocessing matrix, the considered system’s SER performance degrades only marginally with respect to the perfect CIRs assumption.In Figs. 7and 8, we illustrate the attainable sum-capacity per channel use for the dual and triply polarized UL communications, respectively, in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated noise samples. The power allocation regime is based on (44) under the constraint of∑i=12Nkvkiγ¯ki2≤2Nkand∑i=13Nkvkiγ¯ki2≤3Nkfor dual and triply polarized UL communications, respectively. From the Figs. 7 and 8, we may infer that similar to the SER performance, the sum-capacity achieved in terms of the number of bits per channel use degrades noticeably in the context of noisy and fading feedback, whereas in the case of ideal feedback of VQ-CIRs knowledge the achievable sum-capacity remains almost close to that achieved with the perfect CIRs. Nevertheless, the sum-capacity degrades further when the noise samples are correlated as alluded to in (46) due to the post-processing operation. Moreover, the maximum attainable information rate of (47) and (49) can be attained, when the BS exploits the knowledge ofRkin the context of kth user’s symbol detection.In Fig. 9, we present the achievable SER of the system aided by TP devised with the VQ-CIRs knowledge acquired via ideal feedback channels and feedback channels that experience delay, i.e. outdated VQ-CIRs knowledge. The feedback delay considered in our simulation isfdτ=6×10−3[15]. As expected, outdated VQ-CIRs knowledge based preprocessing approach results in performance degradation in terms of the achievable SER compared to the TP based on VQ-CIRs knowledge acquired through ideal feedback channels. The performance deterioration is considerable in the high SNR regime as can be witnessed from the Fig. 9. However, from our study and simulation results, we may conclude that feedbacking the VQ-CIRs knowledge to the MSs for preprocessing matrix formulation can be deemed as an efficient approach to deal with the IAI, when the feedback channels experience zero delay while exhibiting robustness against fading and noise. Further, it can be observed from our results that the TP based system outperforms the SIC-MUD aided system in terms of the achievable SER.Fig. 10demonstrates the performance comparison of the TP approach considered in this treatise with the well-known precoding approaches such as dirty paper coding (DPC) and Tomlinson–Harashima precoding (THP)[19–22]. From the result, we may infer that the SVD-based TP outperforms DPC and THP precodings in terms of the attainable SER as can be seen from the Fig. 10.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we investigated the performance of a UL multi-user feedback MIMO system with the aid of a joint Tx-Rx design and polarization-multiplexing. Our study shows that the joint Tx-Rx design perfectly eliminates the IAI and MUI when the preprocessing and the post-processing are constructed with the perfect CIRs knowledge assumption. Further, our results show that, noise and fading tainted VQ-CIRs knowledge based preprocessing coupled with the perfect CIRs based post-processing results in noticeable performance degradation in terms of the achievable SER and sum-capacity. Besides, our simulation results reveal that further degradation results in the SER, when the outdated CIRs knowledge based preprocessing is employed. Albeit the performance degrades, it can be inferred from our results that, the considered joint Tx-Rx design constructed with the aid of the preprocessing based on the ideal feedback of the VQ-CIRs knowledge and the perfect CIRs based post-processing yields an SER and sum-capacity performance that closely match the performance obtained with the perfect CIRs knowledge assumption. Therefore, we may conclude that polarization-multiplexing coupled with the joint Tx-Rx based on VQ-CIRs knowledge feedback based preprocessing and perfect CIRs knowledge based post-processing can be deemed as an efficient approach for the UL multi-user feedback MIMO system to deal with the IAI and MAI, provided the feedback channels endure zero-delay while exhibiting robustness against noise and fading. Furthermore, our simulation results evince that the joint Tx-Rx design results in better SER performance than the popularly known precoding approaches and the SIC-MUD.
