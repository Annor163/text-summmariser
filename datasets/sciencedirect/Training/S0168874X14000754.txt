@&#ABSTRACT@&#
As storage data density in hard-disk drives (HDDs) increases, precision positioning of HDD heads becomes a more relevant issue to ensure enormous amounts of data to be properly written and read. Since the traditional single-stage voice coil motor cannot satisfy the positioning requirement of high-density tracks per inch HDDs, dual-stage servo systems have been proposed to overcome this matter, by using voice coil motors to coarsely move the HDD head while piezoelectric actuators provide fine and fast positioning. Thus, the aim of this work is to apply topology optimization to design HDD arms, by finding optimal placement of base-plate and piezoelectric material for high precision positioning HDD heads. Topology optimization is a structural optimization technique that combines the finite element method with optimization algorithms, and it uses a rational approximation of material properties to vary the material properties between “void” and “filled” portions. The design problem consists in generating optimized structures that provide maximized displacements, appropriate structural stiffness, and resonance phenomena avoidance. The requirements are achieved by applying formulations to maximize displacement, first resonance frequency, and structural stiffness. The implementation of the algorithm and results that confirm the feasibility of the approach in obtaining improved conceptual designs are presented.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the constant increase in data storage capacity of hard drives, providing proper focusing and track-seeking capabilities becomes major issues to be solved, in order to ensure continuous development of these devices. In Fig. 1(a) it is possible to see a schematic representation of a HDD arm and the focusing and track-seeking displacement directions needed for a proper positioning of the HDD head.Most of the investigation made in the field of HDD head positioning aims at optimizing the structural compliance in order to provide proper control of displacements. Traditional electromagnetic actuators are used to control both focusing and track-seeking positioning. The maximization of eigenfrequencies is also considered in order to avoid the resonance phenomena to appear within the working range of the HDD arm [1,2]. In addition, dynamic performance criterion has been directly optimized in [3]. Although the obtained resonance frequencies are smaller, authors claim that the optimized structures may outperform structures from previous works in terms of dynamic response. Most recently, as an alternative to manage the limitations in positioning found by using electromagnetic actuators, some approaches consider the use of piezoelectric laminated structures to improve the performance of HDD arms [4], see Fig. 1. Additionally, piezoelectric material can provide passive damping.Laminated piezoelectric have found increasing usage in Engineering, specially in the field of smart structures where they can be used both for sensing and actuation. Applications may include airplane wings deformation control [5], automotive frames, reflective antennae [6], deformable mirrors and many others.In most of works regarding laminated piezoelectric transducer design, parametric optimization algorithms are applied to determine optimized piezoelectric material distribution [7], within certain limitations once these approaches demand a previous knowledge of shape and number of patches to be placed. As a more generic and robust approach, once previous knowledge of the design is not required, topology optimization has been applied to the static design of laminated piezoelectric plate and shell actuators to maximize displacements at certain points of the domain by distributing material and choosing material polarization sign [8]. The problem of static shape control has also been developed to find an optimal material layout in a static problem that aims at mimicking a vibration mode by either distributing material considering constant voltage distribution [9] or by finding optimal voltage distribution over the domain [10].Recently, topology optimization has been applied to the design of HDD actuator arms. Sun et al. [11] have optimized the PZT transducer attached to the HDD arm to reduce structural vibration by means of piezoelectric shunt damping. Kim et al. [12] have optimized the HDD arm to reduce bending resonance-induced vibrations off-tracks.Recently, topology optimization has been applied to design a PZT transducer attached to a HDD actuator arm [11] (the piezoelectric transducer is modeled as a plate layer by using shell finite elements in the ANSYS software). The idea is to reduce structural vibration by means of piezoelectric shunt damping.In the present work, on the other hand, topology optimization is applied to design the whole HDD arm (including a laminated piezoelectric structure), for optimized positioning capabilities. In other words, the topology optimization algorithm distributes piezoelectric material over an elastic base layer, chooses its polarization, and optimizes the elastic base layer (which is not carried out in [11]). Thus, a non-intuitive conceptual design of a HDD arm with improved performance is obtained.The maximization of track-seeking displacements together with maximization of the first resonance frequency, which is meant to reduce structural vibration, is considered. However, it is known in topology optimization problems of piezoelectric actuators that the maximization of displacements tends to seek unpractical solutions that abuse the linear model and void material, resulting in structures that are discontinuous between the boundary condition and the actuation point, as it is demonstrated in Section 5. The maximization of the first resonance frequency itself does not solve this problem as there is no information of the actuation point in the modal analysis. Therefore, the maximization of the stiffness of the structure between the boundary conditions and the actuation point is also carried out, together with the previous mentioned functions. However, stiffness maximization counteracts displacement maximization, and thus, a proper multi-objective function must be formulated to balance these functions.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief description of the piezoelectric shell element, particularized to plate structures, is presented. In Section 3, the basic concept of topology optimization is presented. In Section 3.2, the design problem considered in this work is formulated. Section 4 discusses the numerical implementation. In Section 5, some examples are shown to demonstrate the proposed methodology, and, finally, in Section 6, some concluding remarks are inferred.In this work, the HDD structures are modeled using the finite element method (FEM). An appropriate element for this case is the 8-node multi-layer piezoelectric shell element [13,14]. However, as the HDD structures can be designed by plate structures, the FEM formulation presented here is simplified for plate elements. The full FEM formulation for the piezoelectric shell element can be checked in the literature [13,14].The piezoelectric constitutive equations describe the correlation between the mechanical and electrical fields [15]. Considering the plane stress state that develops in thin plates and shells, it is assumed thatσ33=0, and the transverse shear strain ε33 can be eliminated by condensation. Thus, piezoelectric constitutive equations can be written in matrix notation as(1)or(2){σD}=[CeeT−ϵ]{ε−E}where 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the cartesian axis x, y, and z, respectively. ksis the shear correction factor known from elastic plate and shell theory [16], and it is usually equal toks=5/6[17]. The coefficients with⁎appear because of the reduction of ε33:(3)C11⁎=C11−C132C33,C12⁎=C12−C132C33e31⁎=e31−C13e33C33,ϵ33⁎=ϵ33+e332C33The piezoelectric shell element kinematics are described using a first-order shear deformation theory based on the Reissner–Mindlin assumptions for moderately thick plates and considering a quadratic variation of the electric potential through the thickness direction [17,18,13]. Reinforcing that only plate structures are modeled in this work, the 8-node shell element used in this work can be represented by a flat structure, designed in thex−yplane, as it can be seen in Fig. 2, with global (x, y, z) and local (r, s, t) coordinate systems. Each node k=1…8 has 1 electrical and 5 mechanical (3 displacements and 2 rotations) degrees of freedom, as represented in Fig. 2. An additional electrical degree of freedom for each element is considered, which represents the voltage applied between the electrodes. Thus, the finite element totalizes 49 degrees of freedom.Within these assumptions, and considering constant thickness h, the global coordinates of any arbitrary point in the domain can be expressed by using the nodal coordinates and isoparametric formulation as(4){xyz}=∑k=18Nk(r,s){xkykzk+th2}and the displacement and electrical field in the element can be approximated by [17,18](5)u(r,s,t)={u(r,s,t)v(r,s,t)w(r,s,t)}=∑k=18Nk(r,s){uk+th2θykvk−th2θxkwk}(6)ϕ(r,s,t)=12(t+t2)Δϕe+(1−t2)∑k=14Nk(r,s)ϕmkThus, the strainsεand the electrical fieldEcan be written as(7)ε=[a000d0b0−e0ba0−de0cb−g0c0a0g]︸BuueE=−J−1[(1−t2)∂N∂r0(1−t2)∂N∂s0−2tN0.5+t]︸Bϕϕewhereueandϕeare vectors containing the nodal displacements and electric potentials of element e arranged as(8)ue={u1⋯u8v1⋯v8w1⋯w8θx1⋯θx8θy1⋯θy8}Tϕe={ϕm1⋯ϕm8Δϕe}TThe termsa,b,c,d,e,g,N, andJare defined in Appendix A.Using the method of weighted residuals [19], and assuming small deformations (linear theory), the equilibrium equation system that describes the static behavior of the FEM is written as(9)[KuuKuϕKuϕTKϕϕ]{UΦ}={FQ}orK˜U˜=F˜whereU,Φ,F, andQare the mechanical displacements, electric potentials, mechanical force, and electric charge global vectors, respectively.Kuu,Kuϕ, andKϕϕare the stiffness, piezoelectric, and dielectric, global matrices, respectively, which are adequately built using the respective element matrices, given by(10)Kuue=∫ΩeBuTCBudΩKuϕe=∫ΩeBuTeBϕdΩKϕϕe=∫ΩeBϕTϵBϕdΩThis work uses the layer-wise theory to model the multi-layer structure. This theory assumes that two adjacent layers are perfectly bonded, and the displacement field must be continuous at the interface between the two layers. Thus, the equilibrium equation system is modified to [13,18](11)[KuuKuϕBbTKuϕTKϕϕ0Bb00]{UΦL}={FQ0}orK^U^=F^whereLare the Lagrange multipliers andBbis the global coupling matrix which contains all constraint equations defined for each pair of nodes from adjacent layers.

It consists in defining an initial domain, which is discretized into finite elements, and, by applying optimization algorithms, material can be properly distributed over the design domain to accomplish with the design requirements. The final topology can be post-processed, verified and finally manufactured in order to validate the results achieved by the algorithm (it is highlighted that post-processing, verification and manufacturing are not carried out in this work).The main issue to be addressed in the topology optimization is how to change the material property from zero (void) to one (solid material). The discrete (0–1) problem depends on mesh discretization and it has multiple local minima, thus, it is ill-posed. To circumvent this problem, the optimization problem is relaxed by defining a continuous material model which allows the material to assume intermediate material properties. The formulation for intermediate materials (between 0 and 1) defines the level of problem relaxation.This work employs the PEMAP-P (Piezoelectric Material with Penalization and Polarization) material model [8] in the following way:(16)C=ρ1pcC0(17)CD=ρ11+pc(1−ρ1)C0(18)e=ρ1pe(2ρ2−1)pie0(19)ε=ρ1pεε0(20)md=ρ1pmmd0where:0<ρ1≤1and0≤ρ2≤1are the design variables of the optimization problem (whereρ1→0, andρ1=1means the absence and presence of material, respectively, whileρ2=0andρ2=1means negative and positive polarization, respectively) andC0,e0, andε0are the elasticity, piezoelectricity and permittivity tensors of the piezoelectric material. The effective propertyCD, which is given by the RAMP model [21], is employed to calculate the resonance frequency of the transducer, whileCis used in the remaining computations (note thatCD=Cforρ1=0, orρ1=1). This procedure is carried out because the design of structures with dynamic requirements by using topology optimization is susceptible to the appearance of intermediate values of ρ1 in the optimization results [22]. In fact, the proposed procedure has reduced intermediate values in the results. The last equation describes the mass relaxation (md0 is the mass density of the piezoelectric material). In the case of the elastic base layer, only Eqs. (16), (17) and (20) are employed. We use empirical values for the parameters pc, pe,pϵ, piand pm. For an elaborated criterion to choose these parameters values, see the work by Kim et al. [23].In this work, different optimization objectives are combined into a multi-objective function to accomplish with the proposed goals of the HDD arm design.The first objective function involves the maximization of the output displacement uoutAat a given direction along the tracking plane in order to improve the positioning precision of the HDD head. This displacement is generated by the application of an electric voltage between electrodes (equipotential surfaces on top of each piezoelectric layer). Thus, it is necessary to prescribe the electric potential degrees of freedom to calculate the displacements of the domain, as demonstrated in Section 4. Fig. 4shows a representation of the domain, containing the boundary condition, voltage application and output displacement for this objective function.The second objective function is the maximization of the first resonance frequency λ1, which is meant to avoid the appearance of resonance phenomena in the working range of the device. In this case, the same boundary conditions of Fig. 4 are used, and additionally, the electrodes are grounded. More reference on eigenvalue optimization problems can be found in [24–27].The third objective function is the minimization of the mean compliance of the structure, which is applied to avoid unpractical results, like void or disconnected structures, as mentioned previously. The minimization of the mean compliance is carried out in the same direction of the output displacement maximization (see Fig. 5).Considering that the load t31 is applied in only one node, the mean compliance function (L31) is equal to the displacement that this load generates, at the same point and the same direction. Thus,(21)L31=u31Awhere u31Ais obtained from the equilibrium equation:(22)K^U^31=F^31whereF^31contains only one non-zero value, which ist31=1.The proposed multi-objective function for the design of HDD arms can be given by(23)F=(1−w1){w2lnL31−(1−w2)lnuoutA}−w1lnλ1where w1 and w2 are weighting coefficients, which allow to control the contribution of each function. The natural logarithms are meant to scale the functions such that the scaled terms will all have comparable orders of magnitude.The actuators modeled in this work are driven by electric potential, which is theΔϕdegree of freedom. Thus, it is necessary to prescribe the electric potential in Eq. (9) in order to obtain the mechanical displacements and the remaining nodal electric potentials (ϕm). First, let us separate the electrical degrees of freedom in ϕ1 and ϕ2, which correspond to ϕmandΔϕ, respectively:(24)[KuuKuϕ1Kuϕ2BbTKuϕ1TKϕ1ϕ1Kϕ1ϕ20Kuϕ2TKϕ1ϕ2TKϕ2ϕ20Bb000]{UϕmΔϕλ}={FQϕ1Qϕ20}By prescribing the electric potential between the electrodes, and assuming there are no external forces or electrical charges applied (F=0andQ=0, Eq. (24) can be rewritten as(25)[KuuKuϕ1BbTKuϕ1TKϕ1ϕ10Bb00]{Uϕmλ}={Kuϕ2Kϕ1ϕ20}Δϕ(26)orK¯U¯=F¯The expressions for the output displacement uoutA, and the mean compliance function (L31) can be written, respectively, in matricial notation as(27)uout=F¯2TU¯1(28)L31=F^31TU^31whereF¯2is a dummy-vector, which selects uoutAout of the terms ofU¯1. In other words,F^2T=[0…010…0], where the position of the non-zero term corresponds to the position of uoutAinU¯1.An iterative algorithm solves the optimization problem. At each iteration, the objective function (see Eq. (23)) is differentiated with respect to the design variables, and a new approximation is then obtained by the GCMMA (Globally Convergent version of the Method of Moving Asymptotes) by Svanberg [28]. The optimization continues until the convergence criterion of the objective function is satisfied.Topology optimization is subjected to a number of common issues [20], such as checkerboard patterns and mesh-dependency. Most commonly, filtering techniques may be applied to manage those problems [20,29,30]. In this work, the heaviside projection function with β-continuation proposed by Guest et al. [31] is used. In this technique, the design variableρ1e, here called pseudo-density, is calculated by the following expression [31]:(29)ρ1e=1−exp(−βμe)+μeexp(−β)where the parameter β dictates the curvature of the heaviside step function. μeis a weighted average of the nodal design variables diin the neighborhood Neof element e within a specified radius rmin(see Fig. 6), given by [32](30)μe=∑i∈Nediwd(xi−x¯e)∑i∈Newd(xi−x¯e),andwd(xi−x¯e)={rmin−∥xi−x¯e∥rmin,ifi∈Ne;0otherwise.and∥xi−x¯e∥is the distance between the centroid of element e to the neighbor node i.Thus, the optimization problem can be written in its discrete form as(31)Minimize:︸ρ1(d),ρ2F(ρ1(d),ρ2)subjectto:K¯U¯1=F¯1K^U^31=F^31(−λj2M^+K^)Φj=0dmin,i≤di≤1,i=1…nn0≤ρ2,e≤1,e=1…npe∑e=1nveρ1,eVve∑e=1nveVve≤Θv∑e=1npeρ1,eVpe∑e=1npeVpe≤Θpwhere nnis the number of nodes in the entire domain, and nveand npeare the number of elements in the metallic and piezoelectric layers, respectively.dmin,i=10−6is the minimum allowed value for the design variable dito avoid numerical singularities.Because mean compliance minimization is carried out, volume constraints are enforced to avoid fully occupied design domains.Vveand Vpeare the volumes of the eth element for the metallic and piezoelectric layers, respectively. Θvand Θpare the maximum amounts of metallic and piezoelectric material, respectively.All implementations are performed using MATLAB environment. The FEM implementation uses sparse matrices.The gradients of the objective functions are needed so that the GCMMA optimization routine can update the design variables at each iteration.The gradient of Eq. (23) with respect to ρ is given by(32)∂F∂ρ=(1−w1){w2L31∂L31∂ρ−(1−w2)uout∂uoutA∂ρ}−w1λ1∂λ1∂ρwhere ρ might represent ρ1 or ρ2. The differentiation of an eigenvalue λjis computed through [33](33)∂λj∂ρ=ΦjT[∂K∂ρ−λj∂M∂ρ]ΦjΦjTMΦjThe differentiation of uoutAis calculated by(34)∂uoutA∂ρ=F¯2T∂U¯1∂ρThe sensitivity ofU¯1with respect to ρ can be obtained by differentiatingK¯U¯1=F¯1, which leads to(35)∂U¯1∂ρ=K¯−1[∂F¯1∂ρ−∂K¯∂ρU¯1]By substituting Eq. (35) into Eq. (34) we have(36)∂uoutA∂ρ=F¯2TK¯−1[∂F¯1∂ρ−∂K¯∂ρU¯1]However, to calculate a matrix inversion is computationally inefficient. Thus, we use the adjoint method, which substitutes the matrix inversion by linear equations system solution, which is more efficient. Hence, Eq. (37) can be rewritten as(37)∂uoutA∂ρ=U¯2T[∂F¯1∂ρ−∂K¯∂ρU¯1]whereU¯2is the adjoint vector obtained by solving the linear equations systemK¯U¯2=F¯2.Analogously, the sensitivity of L31 can be calculated by(38)∂L31∂ρ=−U^31T∂K^∂ρU^31The differentiation of the stiffness and mass matrices are calculated, essentially, by differentiating Eqs. (16) to (20), which gives(39)∂C∂ρ1=pcρ1pc−1C0(40)∂CD∂ρ1=1+pc[1+pc(1−ρ1)]2C0(41)∂e∂ρ1=peρ1pe−1(2ρ2−1)pie0(42)∂e∂ρ2=ρ1pe2pi(2ρ2−1)pi−1e0(43)∂ε∂ρ1=pερ1pε−1ε0(44)∂md∂ρ1=pmρ1pm−1md0Finally, because of the heaviside projection technique, we must use the chain rule to differentiate the objective functionFwith respect to di, which yields in:(45)∂F∂di=∂F∂ρ1∂ρ1∂diand∂ρ1/∂dis obtained by differentiating Eq. (29), and then, Eq. (30), which results in(46)∂ρ1∂di=[βexp(−βμe))+exp(−β)]∂μe∂di(47)∂μe∂di=wd(xi−x¯e)∑j∈Newd(xj−x¯e)In all examples, PZT is employed for the piezoelectric layers and its material properties are given in Table 1. The metallic layer considered in the examples is made of Aluminum, with Young׳s modulus E=71GPa, Poisson׳s ratioν=0.334, and mass densityρ=2700kg/m3.Three layers are employed, see Fig. 7. As it can be seen, only one side (Γ1) of the aluminum layer is clamped. The design domain regarding the aluminum layer has dimensions equal to 20×5mm. The design domains for the piezoelectric layers, on the other hand, are 9×5mm, and they do not reach the hard-disk drive head. The reason for avoiding piezoelectric material near this particular region is that it is desired to avoid electric current flow in the head, whose operation, based on electromagnetic effects, could then be jeopardized. Black and white finite elements at the top and bottom meshes regarding the piezoelectric layers (see Fig. 7) indicate that the polarization initial guesses are equal to one (positive) and zero (negative), respectively.The middle aluminum layer is 0.08mm thick and the top and bottom piezoelectric layers are 0.20mm thick. They are discretized in 160×40 and 72×40 finite elements, respectively. The projection radius is equal tormin=0.5mmand the heaviside parameter β is equal to zero (linear projection) in the beginning of the optimization process. The continuation method is applied where β is increased by unit every five iterations between iterations30≤it<80, and than, it is increased by 5 units, also every five iterations, between iterations80≤it<100. This approach is used to reduce the appearance of intermediate material in the final result. The PEMAP-P penalization parameters used in the examples presented are equal topc=pe=6andpϵ=pi=pm=1. These parameters (rmin, β, pc, pe,pϵ, pi, pm, w1, w2, Θv, and Θp) have great influence on the optimized result, such as the output displacement uoutA, resonance frequency and appearance of intermediate values. Several examples with different values of w1, w2, Θv, and Θpare presented.To enforce only in-plane displacements, two symmetry conditions are applied to the design variables. The first symmetry condition is the mirror symmetry where an imaginary mirror is positioned in the planey−zat the middle of the plate width (x=2.5mm), making the variables d and ρ1 to be reflected on both sides. In the case of the variable ρ2, the reflection must have opposite polarization, and thus,ρ2,left=1−ρ2,right. The second symmetry condition is the layer symmetry, where both piezoelectric layer must have same variables d and ρ1, and opposite polarization,ρ2,bottom=1−ρ2,top. Because of this second symmetry condition, only the top piezoelectric layer is displayed in the optimization result figures.In the first example, the weighting coefficients are equal tow1=0.3andw2=0.5, and the target amounts of metallic and piezoelectric materials Θvand Θpare equal to 0.4 and 0.3, respectively. This example is called here the quasi-static design, which considers the optimization of the output displacement and the maximization of the first resonance frequency (minimization of mean compliance is also considered). The material distribution (ρ1) optimization results of the top piezoelectric and middle aluminum layers are presented in Fig. 8a and c, respectively, remembering that top and bottom piezoelectric layers are equal. Black and white elements represent solid and void materials, respectively. Grayscaled elements represent intermediate material which can be further post-processed into solid or void elements, depending on a threshold value. However, post-processing is beyond the scope of this work. The polarization (ρ2) optimization result of the top piezoelectric layer if presented in Fig. 8b, remembering that the polarization of the bottom piezoelectric layer has opposite polarization sign than the top layer. The polarization optimization result of void elements has no physical meaning, and thus, they are not displayed. In this case, the output displacement is equal tououtA=0.92μmand the first resonance frequency is equal tof1=392Hz.Fig. 9presents the top view of the deformed shape of the optimized result of example 1 (actuated as demonstrated in Fig. 4), where red elements represent the aluminum material and blue and green elements represent the piezoelectric material with positive and negative polarizations, respectively, where positive polarization follows the positive direction of z axis (see Fig. 4).In the second example, only the parameter w1 is changed, and it is equal tow1=0, which means that a pure static design is performed. The optimization results figures are shown in Fig. 10.Fig. 11presents the top view of the deformed shape of the optimized result of example 2. The output displacement is equal tououtA=0.81μmand the first resonance frequency is equal tof1=228Hz.As expected, the first resonance frequency value of this example is lower than the value of example 1. However, the output displacement is also reduced, which means that the mean compliance function has predominant effect in the static design, even with the same value of w2 for the quasi-static design.In the third example, the weighting coefficients are equal to w1=0.3 andw2=0, which means that the mean compliance function is not used. The material distribution figure (Fig. 12) shows that this case does not generate a valid solution, thus, the polarization optimization result is not presented. As expected, without the mean compliance function, the structure has no connectivity between the boundary condition and point A. So, this example is discarded. The same problem is observed forw1=1(w2 is neglected), where only eigenfrequency maximization is considered. However, the reason is different here. The maximization of the first resonance frequency is obtained by concentrating material near the boundary condition and making the structure shorter. Also, the modal analysis does not have any information about point A, so this case is not considered to be presented.The last example presented here uses the same weighting coefficients than the first example (w1=0.3andw2=0.5), however, the target amounts of material are changed toΘv=Θp=0.5. The optimization results figures are shown in Fig. 13.Fig. 14presents the top view of the deformed shape of the optimized result of example 4. The output displacement is equal tououtA=0.94μmand the first resonance frequency is equal tof1=345Hz.In this case, the output displacement is the greatest because there is more piezoelectric material to actuate. However, this larger amount of piezoelectric and metallic material has decreased the resonance frequency.Therefore, Table 2summarizes the results presented in this paper.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The conceptual results in this paper show that by applying a topology optimization algorithm in the field of laminated piezoelectric HDD arms is a very promising approach to deal with the increasingly demanding requirements in computer storage area. Namely, a laminated structure with optimized positioning capabilities, increased resonance frequencies (and thus, reduced structural oscillation), and maximized stiffness has been obtained.The future work for this project includes the study and implementation of manufacturing constraints in the software; further investigation of the HDD design requirements in order to propose more refined designs; and also an experimental stage by manufacturing some transducers and performing their characterization to validate the results obtained with the software.
