@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Durable products are characterized by their modular structured design as well as their long life cycle. Each class of components involved in the multi-indenture structure of such products requires a different recovery process. Moreover, due to their long life cycle, the return flows are of various quality levels. In this article, we study a closed-loop supply chain in the context of durable products with generic modular structures. To this end, we propose a mixed-integer programming model based on a generic disassembly tree where the number of each sub-assembly depends on the quality status of the return stream. The model determines the location of various types of facilities in the reverse network while coordinating forward and reverse flows. We also consider the legislative target for the recovery of used products as a constraint in the problem formulation. We present a Benders decomposition-based solution algorithm together with several algorithmic enhancements for this problem. Computational results illustrate the superior performance of the solution method.Set of disassembly centersSet of bulk recycling centersSet of collection centersSet of disposal centersSet of secondary

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Landfilling of End-Of-Life (EOL) durable products that contain large quantities of precious and depletable raw materials is a major concern in terms of sustainability and environmental footprints. In recent decades, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in several countries, such as Germany and Japan, have been facing with legislations on the take-back of their EOL products. Meanwhile, they have started recognizing the product recovery as an opportunity for saving production costs through reusing the recovered parts in their forward flow in addition to having access to the secondary markets. Hence, the OEMs have been forced to extend the scope of traditional logistics to incorporate the return flows from customers to manufacturer. As pointed out by Guide and Van Wassenhove (2002), OEMs that have been most successful with their reverse supply chains are those that closely coordinate it with the forward supply chain, initiating the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). In a CLSC, the role of the reverse supply chain (RSC) is to collect used products from end-users, inspect and sort them as needed, ship them to various recovery facilities, and finally redistribute the recovered items into the forward supply chain or to the secondary markets.This study is motivated by the recovery of durable products, such as aircraft, automobile, and large household appliances that are distinguished by their multi-indenture structure as well as their long life cycle. Such products can be disassembled into several components namely modules, parts, and precious raw materials. As opposed to simple waste, e.g., paper, carpet, and sand, that can only be recycled, each of the aforementioned components in the disassembly tree of durable products can be recovered by a particular recovery process. In the context of durable products with long life cycle, it can be expected that the majority of the return stream is composed of poor quality returns with a small number of recoverable modules and parts (Krikke, Bloemhof-Ruwaard, & Van Wassenhove, 2003). In other words, only a small portion of the return flows might belong to the warranty or damaged items involving a large number of high quality modules and parts. Since the remanufacturing cost increases as the quality of returns decrease, OEMs expect larger revenue through the recovery of high quality returns and thus might be less motivated for the acquisition and recovery of lower quality ones. However, the legislation, e.g., in Europe and Japan, sets targets for the recovery of used products. Failure to meet this target would incur penalties to the OEM and it has a negative impact on the image of the company from customers’ point of view.The existing CLSC network design models in the literature cover only a few recovery options, such as product remanufacturing and material recycling. In an attempt to fill the gap in the current literature on the design of CLSC networks, this paper proposes a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model which formulates CLSC network design for the case of used durable products based on a generic disassembly tree. In addition to the location of collection, disassembly, and disposal facilities, the model will also decide on the location of a variety of recovery facilities such as remanufacturing, bulk recycling, and material recycling designated for each class of components of durable products.Moreover, the variable quality status of the return stream has been incorporated in the structure of the aforementioned disassembly tree. More specifically, we assume that the return stream fits into various quality levels; warranty or damaged returns are usually categorized as the high quality stream, while EOL items are assigned to the poor quality stream. To the best of our knowledge, the issue of non-homogeneous quality of the components in the disassembly tree of complex structured products which affects the right choice of the recovery option has never been addressed in the CLSC design literature. As another contribution, we have also considered the legislative target imposed to OEMs for the recovery of returns in order to address environmental concerns regarding the harmful effects of leaving used products in the environment.On account of the fact that the proposed MIP model is among the most large-scale CLSC network design models particularly due to various types of recovery facilities in the reverse network as well as the comprehensive generic disassembly tree, we have developed an efficient solution method based on Benders decomposition (Benders, 1962). Regarding that the previous studies in the context of CLSC and RSC design have addressed less complicated networks, their Benders decomposition algorithmic schemes are limited to the generation of multiple optimality cuts, cut strengthening, and introducing the trust region restriction to the master problem (Pishvaee, Razmi, & Torabi, 2014; Üster, Easwaran, Akçali, & Cetinkaya, 2007). We, however, deploy a variety of enhancements including: (1) Adding valid inequalities to the master problem to reduce the number of feasibility cuts; (2) Generating enhanced Pareto-optimal cuts to exclude a larger space of the master problem; and (3) Specializing the local branching search to the proposed CLSC design model to concurrently improve both lower and upper bounds during the execution of Benders decomposition. Local branching as a neighborhood search algorithm offers a general search strategy that might be adapted to the type of problem being solved. It should be emphasized that we have adapted the local branching scheme described in the seminal work of Fischetti and Lodi (2003) to the type of our problem of interest in the case of Benders decomposition to dramatically improve the convergence of the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine the enhanced Pareto-optimality cuts of Papadakos (2008) with the local branching within Benders decomposition algorithm.In summary, the main contribution of our study is twofold. Firstly, we formulate a CLSC network design problem based on a generic disassembly tree corresponding to durable products with non-homogeneous quality status. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the most generic CLSC strategic planning model in the sense that it involves all recovery options plausible in taking different sub-assemblies of a product while also considering legislative recovery target as an environmental goal. Secondly, we propose an exact solution algorithm based on Benders decomposition in conjunction with several computational enhancements such as improved Pareto-optimality cuts and local branching.The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In the next section, we provide the overview of the most relevant literature. In Section 3, we provide more details on the problem investigated in this paper and then present its formulation. Section 4 describes the solution methodology. Computational experiments are presented in Section 5. Conclusion and future areas of research are provided in Section 6.
