@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this investigation a coupling between a 3D solid-shell element for the analysis of multilayered composite shell structures and a specific response surface method is proposed. The first part of the paper is dedicated to the finite element formulation of a developed composite 8-node solid-shell element calledSCH8γ7, based only on translational degrees of freedom. The basis of the present finite element formulation is the standard 8-node brick element with tri-linear shape functions. A particular attention is given to alleviate shear, trapezoidal and thickness locking, without resorting to the classical plane-stress assumption. Assumed natural strain method and enhanced assumed strain method are used to improve the relative poor element behavior of a standard hexahedral displacement element. The anisotropic material behavior of layered shells is modeled using a fully three dimensional elastic orthotropic material law in each layer, including the thickness stress component. The second part of the paper will focus on an adaptive response surface method for the structural optimization problem. The response surfaces are built using moving least squares approximations and design of experiments by means of a specific method called Diffuse Approximation.Several numerical applications to composite multilayered shell structures are studied to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Good results of analysis and optimization using the developedSCH8γ7solid-shell element have been obtained in comparison with reference analytical solutions and with those obtained using the SC8R solid-shell finite element available inABAQUS©code.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the modeling of shell structures various problems may appear especially when shell finite elements are used in combination with solid elements. Therefore special connection elements are necessary to link shell elements with solids having different degrees of freedom. It turns obvious to develop general-purpose brick elements, which are able to deal with any type of structures (solid, shell, and/or their combination).3D-continuum elements are a variety of Finite Element (FE) models halfway between solid elements and thin shells. They have the same freedom configuration of solid elements but account for shell-like behavior in the thickness direction. They are very attractive for modeling shell-like regions of a 3D structure without the need of special elements to connect solid elements to shell nodes. 3D-continuum elements also called solid-shell elements have many benefits compared to the degenerated shell elements, mainly because of the simplicity of their kinematics, their ability in modeling complex structures generally composed of massive and thin-walled regions and also special rotations treatment in geometric nonlinear analysis may be avoided.The 3D-continuum FE concept has attracted many researchers since the late 1990s. Domissy et al. [15] and Sze et al. [37] are probably the first authors to investigate a solid-shell approach for the analysis of plates and shells. In 1998, Hauptmann and Schweizerhof [20] propose an extension to the original solid-shell theory called double-node models where the position of an arbitrary point in the element is assumed to depend either linearly or quadratically, on the thickness coordinate. In 1998, Cho et al. [12] proposed a solid-shell element model based on the assumed strain formulation for buckling and postbuckling analysis of shell structures.During the last decade, solid-shell FE models for thin shell structures have attracted considerable attention. Numerous models have been proposed in the literature and can be found in Sze and Yao [38], Vu-Quoc and Tan [40], Areias et al. [3], Harnau and Schweizerhof [19], Alves de Sousa et al. [2], Hannachi et al. [18], Quy and Matzenmiller [32], Nguyen et al. [29], Shiri et al. [35] and more recently the work of Schwarze and Reese [34], Moreira et al. [25]. Solid-shell element properties make them appropriate also for the modeling of laminated structures as can be seen in some representative references [3,21,25,33,40], to name just a few. In all of these works it has been shown that it is possible to use a solid-shell finite element models which possess no rotational degrees of freedom and obtain good results for the resolution of various structural problems. However, development of these elements is not straightforward, transverse shear, trapezoidal and thickness locking phenomena must be alleviated and therefore special treatments have to be included to suppress the numerical locking effects become crucial.Transverse shear locking is characterized by an overestimation of stiffness associated to transverse shear strain energy [2]. The most common methods that have been used to solve the shear locking effect are the Selective Reduced Integration (SRI) scheme [2] and also the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) which has been applied firstly on shells by Dvorkin and Bathe [17] and as can be seen in the works of [3,11,15,35] for a fully integrated solid-shell element.Trapezoidal locking is only found in structures where the directors of the element edges are not perpendicular to the mid-plane. One method to resolve this pathology is by using the ANS interpolation of the transverse strain in thickness direction as performed in [8,9,37,38], where it was proposed to avoid artificial thickness straining.Thickness locking, caused by Poisson's ratio coupling to the in-plane and transverse normal stress and normal strain responses [14,15] can be overcome by plane-stress assumption, or more generally by the Enhanced Assumed thickness Strain (EAS), where a 7th parameter is added [10,21] and suppressed by condensation technique. This locking pathology usually appears when a solid-shell element with only translational degrees of freedom is to be used in problems involving bending.The 7th parameter as proposed by Büchter and Ramm [10] is an extension of classical shear deformation theory. The interest of this model is especially useful when full three-dimensional constitutive law is used which allows solving problems involving large strains. In their work, Büchter and Ramm [10] describe the 7th parameter model along with a FE formulation and they introduce it on the element level by means of the hybrid-mixed formulation. In the present solid-shell model, the 7th parameter is resulting independently from the FE formulation, i.e. it can be understood as semi-discretization of the solid-shell element through the thickness. Based on this technique, the obtained 7th parameter model is considered simply as a two-dimensional continuous concept with 7 degrees of freedom per node of the reference surface. The 7th parameter is then eliminated using the static condensation procedure on the element level.Another alternative, has been proposed recently by Professor Brunet and his collaborators [4], concerning a solid-shell element with 9 nodes: 8 are located at the element vertices and the 9th is located at the centroid. The authors used classically a reduced integration with one in-plane quadrature point with an assumed shear-strain field to avoid locking phenomena. The centroid node is used as an extra parameter to enhance the displacement in the thickness direction and thus obtain a linear normal strain, allowing the use of full three-dimensional constitutive strain–stress behavior.During last few years, Response Surface Method (RSM) [24] has gained more and more importance in the optimization of general shell structures [30]. RSM has the advantage of replacing a complex response model by an approximate one based on results calculated at various points in the design space. The optimization is then performed at a lower cost over such response surfaces. Two important issues when applying RSM to a particular problem concern the Design of Experiments (DOE) and construction of accurate approximation functions [13,22] so that rapid convergence may be achieved.In the present work, we exploit the RSM based on Diffuse Approximation (DA) [7,26] and particularly the notion of pseudo-derivative to design a specific optimization technique, custom built for this regression model. This new method is an extension of pattern search in two aspects: (1) accommodation of arbitrary regular and irregular patterns; (2) design points eligible for inclusion in any pattern instance belong to a predefined set in the design where experiments are authorized.The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present the kinematics, the material law, and the variational equations of a 3D-shell formulation with convective coordinates with the associated FE description. A special technique, which is necessary for integration through the layers in the 3D-case, is also given. In Section 3 the optimization procedure dedicated for the design of material parameters is given, a special attention is set to the built of response surface model, we use to approximate the implicit objective function. In the fourth section we discuss the applicability of the proposed procedure which consists in coupling between RSM, DOE and solid-shell solution for the modeling of several standard benchmarks which have been given by NAFEMS [28]. The obtained results are compared with those obtain usingABAQUS©commercial software via its solid-shell element called SC8R. Finally some conclusions are drawn.To overcome the difficulties of rotational degrees of freedom (dof) in conventional shell elements, the shell kinematics of deformation is described using the position vectors of a pair of material points at the top and at the bottom of the shell mid-surface (Fig. 1).In this kinematic description, a straight transverse fiber before deformation remains straight after deformation. Such transverse fiber does not need necessarily to be normal to the shell mid-surface before deformation, as well as after deformation. With respect to nodal designation (Fig. 2), the coordinate vectorXand displacement vectoruof the element, are [5,6,16](1)X(ξ,η,ζ)=X0(ξ,η)+ζXn(ξ,η)=∑i=14Ni(ξ,η)1−ζ2Xi−+1+ζ2Xi+(2)u(ξ,η,ζ)=u0(ξ,η)+ζun(ξ,η)=∑i=14Ni(ξ,η)1−ζ2ui−+1+ζ2ui+where Niare the two-dimensional 4-node Lagrangian interpolation functions,Xi−,ui−andXi+,ui+are respectively, the coordinate and displacement vectors of the ith node on the bottom and top shell surfaces respectively (Fig. 1).Using Eq.

(2) and (3), the displacement gradient vector in the curvilinear coordinate system can be expressed as(12)du=Ldswith(13)L=FTLζanddu=Lζdξis the displacement gradient tensor in the parametric coordinate system. In order to calculate the strain tensor directly in the curvilinear coordinate system, we have to define a tensor which is given by [6,15,41](14)C=F−1Qwhere(15)C=aζ1·t1ζaζ1·t2ζaζ1·nζaζ2·t1ζaζ2·t2ζaζ2·nζ00aζ3·nζand(16)F−1=[aζ1;aζ2;aζ3]TThe covariant strain tensor can be calculated using(17)Ec=12(L+LT)where components ofEcare as follows:Eξξ=a1ζT·u,ξ,2Eξη=a1ζT·u,η+a2ζT·u,ξEηη=a2ζT·u,η,2Eξζ=a1ζT·u,ζ+a3ζT·u,ξEζζ=a3ζT·u,ζ,2Eηζ=a2ζT·u,ζ+a3ζT·u,ηTherefore, we obtain a simple relationship between the curvilinear and covariant strain tensors(18)E=CTEcCNow, by using the engineering notation, relation of Eq.

For that purpose, we express the components of the tangent elastic moduli tensor relative to the fiber reference axis{m1;m2;m3}of lamina [23](20)H=H1111H11120H111300H1122H22220H22230000H1212000H1133H22330H3333000000H1313000000H2323Each layer is constituted of an orthotropic elastic material directions{m1;m2;m3}(see Fig. 3). The non-zero coefficients of the behavior matrix are given by the following expressions:H1111=E1(1−ν23ν32)/K,H1122=E1(ν21+ν23)/KH2222=E2(1−ν13ν31)/K,H1113=E1(ν31+ν21ν32)/KH2223=E2(ν32+ν12ν31)/K,H3333=E3(1−ν12ν21)/Kfori,j=1,2,3andi≠jH1212=G12,H1313=G13H2323=G23,νijEj=νjiEiwithK=1−ν12ν21−ν13ν31−ν23ν32−ν12ν23ν31−ν13ν21ν32, E1, E2 and E3 are the elastic moduli in the principal material directions{m1;m2;m3},νijand Gijare respectively the Poisson's ratio and the shear modulus.Since matrix is associated with the principal material directions, we need to transform it from the lamina coordinate axes{m1;m2;m3}to the global cartesian coordinate axes{X;Y;Z}. Withθbeing the fiber orientation angle relative to the global cartesian system (Fig. 3), the relationship between the lamina coordinate system and the global Cartesian system is given by(21)m1=cosθX+sinθYm2=−sinθX+cosθYm3=ZThe final constitutive tensorH˜can be expressed in the convective coordinates as(22)H˜=RTHRwith(23)R=(r11)2(r12)2r11r12(r13)2r12r13r11r13(r21)2(r22)2r21r22(r23)2r22r23r22r232r11r212r12r22r11r22+r12r212r13r23r12r23+r22r13r11r23+r21r13(r31)2(r32)2r31r32(r33)2r32r33r31r332r21r312r22r32r21r32+r31r222r23r33r22r33+r32r23r21r33+r31r232r11r312r12r32r11r32+r31r122r13r33r12r33+r32r13r11r33+r31r13andrij=Qζjmi.The stresses can be evaluated in the curvilinear coordinate system (Fig. 4) as(24)S=H˜Zwhere the stress tensorS={SxxSyySxySzz′Sxz′Syz′}TThe principal of virtual work can be stated as(25)W(u,δu)=Wint−Wext=0∀δu≠0andu=0,u=u¯on Su.With Suis the shell contour where displacements are imposed.

In order to deal with the several locking phenomena separately, we need to split the expression of virtual internal work by separating the membrane/bending, thickness and transverse shear effects [6,15].(27)Wint=Wmb+Wtr+Wshwith(28)Wmb=∫VδEsTH˜1EsdVWtr=∫VδEzTH˜2EzdVWsh=∫VδGsTH˜3GsdVandEs={ExxEyy2Exy}T,Ez={ExxEyyEz′z′}T,Gs={2Exz′2Eyz′}T.H˜1,H˜2andH˜3are sub-matrices extracted from the global material matrixH˜according to the different strain components.In the context of modeling multilayered composite structures using solid-shell elements, there exist two possibilities regarding the numerical implementation:•Case of one element per layer: This is the easiest way for modeling the entire thickness of the structure using several elements (1 element per layer) as indicated in Fig. 5. In this case the numerical procedure of integration is straightforward and does not require any efforts in the implementation compared to the case of isotropic material modeling. The user has to provide the following basic properties:1.Declaration of n groups of different elements in the FE mesh, these groups correspond to the n different material layers constituting the laminate.Provide the physical characteristics of each layer.Case of several layers per element: This second technique consists in stacking the different material layers within the same element (see Fig. 5). Each FE is a stack of several layers, therefore stress calculation and numerical integration of the stiffness matrix is carried out using the “single-layer approach” identical to the one commonly used for the integration of plasticity, by using either one or several Lobatto integration points through the thickness for each layer.In the present investigation, this second method has been implemented because it is more general and more convenient since it requires only one element in the thickness of the structure (gain of CPU time in the case of industrial applications). On the other side the drawback the chosen element kinematic will not be able to capture delamination effects.In this case, the numerical implementation of the FE model requires some modifications of the stresses calculation and the integration of the stiffness matrix. For each element the user has to provide the following properties:1.Declaration of n groups of materials, these n groups correspond to the different layers constituting the multilayered structure.Provide the physical characteristics for each material.Provide for each layer i, the thickness hi(with∑i=1nhi=htotal thickness of the structure).For instance, the numerical implementation for the in-plane membrane/flexion effect is done in the following way:(29)Wmb=∫A∫z=−h/2z=+h/2δEsTSsdzdA=∑i=1nl∫Ai∫z=−hi/2z=+hi/2δEsTSsdzdAwhere nl is the number of layers, hirepresents the layer thickness and h is the total thickness of the structure.Eq. (29) implies that for each layer of material, all operators are reported to the mid-plane of every layer i then the numerical integration is performed using Lobatto integration scheme with N points through the thickness direction. In the present model, 2 Lobatto integration points are used in the thickness direction for each layer, since all applications involve only elastic material behavior, for the case of material nonlinearities, at least 5 integration points will be necessary to achieve a correct stress integration.A solid-shell element formulated using Eqs. (26)–(28) with standard integration based on 2×2×N Gauss schema will fail because of numerous locking phenomena.An effective method of resolving shear locking is the Assumed natural Strain method in which the natural transverse shear strains are sampled and then interpolated at some discrete element points. The transverse shear strains2Eξζand2Eηζare calculated according to the average surface plan (ζ=0), assuming that they vary linearly (Fig. 6), and are function ofγξandγηat the mid-side points:(30)2EξζANS=1−η2γξA1+1+η2γξA2(31)2EηζANS=1−ξ2γηB1+1+ξ2γηB2Similar to shear locking, trapezoidal locking occurs when lower order elements such as 8-node hexahedral elements are used to model curved shells so that their cross-sections assume the trapezoidal shape these excessive number of sampled thickness strains can be reduced by using a bilinear interpolation of the transverse normal strains sampled at the four corners of the element mid-surface (Fig. 7), namely(32)E˜zANS=∑i=1414(1+ξiξ)(1+ηiη)Eζ(ξi,ηi)Poisson's ratio coupling requires the thickness strain to be a linear function ofζ. Because our solid-shell element has only two layers, as consequence the thickness strain does not vary withζthus the element fail in reproducing the plane-stress condition. In order to obtain a linear distribution of the normal strain in thickness direction, we enhance the thickness strain field by adding an internal degree of freedom as(33)EzEAS=E˜zANS+αζeζwhereαis the 7th independent internal parameter. Eq. (33) is known as the Enhanced Assumed Strains (EAS), in which the enrichment variableαwill be eliminated by static condensation technique within the element level. By substituting Eqs. (30–31) and (33) into Eq. (28), the virtual internal work takes the final expression(34)Wint=∑i=1nl∫ξ∫η∫ζiζi+1(δEsTH˜1Es+δEzEASTH˜2EzEAS+δGsANSTH˜3GsANS)Jdζdηdξwhere nl is the number of element layers andζiis the transverse coordinate position of the ith layer along the thickness. After applying the FE discretization with the use of Eqs. (30), (31) and (33) into the previous equation, one can obtain(35)Wint=δunT(Kmb+KtrEAS+KshANS)un+δαkαα+δαkαuT·un+δunTkαuαThe expressions ofkαuandkαfor the composite multilayered element are given by(36)kαu=∑i=1nl∫ξ∫η∫ζiζi+1ζH˜233BzTeζJdζdξdη(37)kα=∑i=1nl∫ξ∫η∫ζiζi+1ζ2H˜233eζJdζdξdηFinally we carry out a static condensation, in order to eliminate the 7th unknown parameterαin the previous expression which leads toα=(−1/kα)kαuT·un. Then the final stiffness matrix takes the following expression:(38)K=Kmb+KtrEAS+KshANS−1kαkαu⊗kαuTThe resulting 8-node hexahedral solid-shell FE model with 24 degrees of freedom is calledSCH8γ7.The optimization problem can be stated as [30](39)Minimizef(x),x∈Rnsubject to a set of m+2n constraints:(40)gi(x)≤0,j=1,…,mLi≤xi≤Ui,i=1,…,nwhere f is the objective function (OF), xiare the design variables, gjis the jth constraint. The region of interest is defined by Liand Uiwhich are respectively the lower and upper bounds on the design variables. The RSM approach consists in solving a problem where the OF is replaced by its approximationf˜.This new problem may be written as(41)Minimizef˜(x),x∈RnSubjecttog˜i(x)≤0,j=1,…,mLi≤xi≤Ui,i=1,…,nThe approximation Eq. (41) is based on a set of numerical experiments with the function f. Generally, the approximate functions encountered in RSM rely on second-order models, over a given region of interest, with the constant regression coefficients fitted by means of least squares. The idea in this work is to apply minimization algorithm progression by building new response surfaces centered each successive solution (Fig. 8). During the progression of the process, the region of interest moves and new numerical experiments are performed at each iteration, which is known as the Moving Least Square (MLS) approximation.In the present investigation, we explore the application of DA regression for building the response surface during the iterative process. In the DA Method used in this work [26,27], the approximating functions are polynomials fitted to the nodal values of each local domain by a weighted least squares approximation. Belytschko et al. [7] developed an Element Free Galerkin (EFG) method which is an alternative implementation using Moving Least Square (MLS) approximation [24]. In this paper we adopt the moving least squares (MLS) interpolation. In the DAM the idea is to replace the OF f(x) computed using the FE method, for a local moving square fitting. The resulting functionf˜is more regular that the function of the FE method, since the discontinuous coefficients are placed, by continuous functions of weight, which gives a continuityCm(m≥1). The approximate function becomes smooth by using continuous weighting functions. Different weight functions have been proposed in the literature, they differ in both the shape of the domain of influence, and in functional form. The truncated Gaussian spherical weight function used in this work is given by (Fig. 9)(42)w(xi,x)=w(r)=exp(β2r2)−exp(β2)1−exp(β2)wherer=∥xi−x∥/di, with dibeing the radius of a spherical support. As we can observe in Fig. 9, the parameterβaffects the shape of the weight function. Generally, small values of the parameterβlead to a smooth and diffuse approximation but with the cost of a slow convergence process, and for larger values ofβthe optimization process converges more rapidly but increases the risk of divergence. Through the present investigation, it has been found by the authors, thatβ≥2(Fig. 9) is a good compromise since it insures a good convergence rate while maintaining a certain amount of diffusive character on the approximation.The approximation is local, which means that only the points closest to the current optimum are taken into account (Fig. 10). The approximation coefficients are continuous when panning and/or zooming of the region of interest is performed.Given the function values for a set of experimental pointsxidistributed according to a chosen Design of Experiment, the functionf˜can be defined in terms of basis functionspand some adjusting coefficientsaas(43)f˜(x)=pT(x)·a(x)A common choice for the basis functionspare linear and quadratic monomialsp(x)=1x1x2x3…xnx1x2x1x3…xixi+1…x122…xn22TThe size N of the vectorpdepends on the number of variables n and on the polynomial degree of the approximation, for instance if quadratic approximation is used, thenN=(n+1)(n+2)/2.

The weight functions play a crucial role by influencing the way that the coefficientsadepend on the location of the design pointx.The minimization ofJ(a)leads to the coefficientsaand consequently the function to the expression of the functionf˜. Thus, to obtain nonlinear parameters vectora, we use(45)∂J∂a=A(x)a−B(x)Z=0with(46)AN×N(x)=PTW(x)P(47)BN×M(x)=PTW(x)and(48)WM×M=w(x1)0w(x2)⋱0w(xM)(49)PM×N=pT(x1)⋮pT(xM)andZM×N=f(x1)⋮f(xM)Once the objective function is estimated, then an optimization algorithm can be used to minimize the resulting OF. In this work we have adopted an algorithm based on a Sequential Quadratic Programming technique [31] and a second algorithm based on the Simplex method. Both algorithms are robust enough and suitable to deal with constrained nonlinear optimization problems. But any Minimization algorithm may be used at this stage.We have to notice, that as the minimization procedure is an iterative process, therefore at least few iterations (generally less than 10) are often needed for the SQP algorithm in order to find the optimal solution of the metamodel obtained using the RSM based on DA.In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the solid-shell FE model defined previously, several benchmarks are carried out with the aim of studying its behavior regarding the locking phenomena, as well as the global rate of convergence.The problem considered is the analysis of a flat plate made from two layers oriented at ±45°, subjected to a uniform pressure loading. The example verifies simple laminated composite plate analysis. Our numerical results are compared with the analytical solution given in Spilker et al. [36] and a second verification is done by a comparison to the results obtained usingABAQUS©SC8R solid-shell FE model. In this benchmark, the cross-section is not balanced, so the response includes membrane-bending coupling.The structure is a two-layer, composite, orthotropic, square plate that is simply supported on its bottom edges. The layers are oriented at ±45° with respect to the plate edges. Fig. 11shows the plate dimensions and the loading pressure which is applied on the top surface of the plate. Each layer has the material properties given in Table 1.Table 2summarizes the results of deflection by comparing the normal displacement at the center of the plate and the in-plane displacement at (x=0,y=b/2) to the analytical solution and to those obtained usingABAQUS©by means of the SC8R solid-shell FE model. We can observe from Table 2; that the present model gave more precise results than those obtained with the solid-shell model ofABAQUS©with the same number of elements. For instance, with only 10 elements, we obtain a maximum deflection of 22.461mm which represents 3.4% of error when compared to the analytical solution 23.250mm, while the solution obtained using the SC8R solid-shell element ofABAQUS©is 28.543mm which presents and error of 22.7%.One-quarter of the laminated strip is modeled. The same problem is analyzed using different meshes of the developed 3D solid-shell FE model. Various options are used to model the laminated strip through the thickness. The models using the developedSCH8γ7solid-shell employ a single element in the thickness direction using a composite section based on 7 single-layers through the thickness.The structure is a 7-layer, composite, orthotropic, rectangular strip that is simply supported on its supports on A and B and subjected to a line load of 10N/mm at C onto the top surface (Fig. 12). The layers are oriented at 0°/90° consecutively with respect to the strip edges. Each layer has the material properties given by Table 3below.Our numerical results are compared with the reference solution given by NAFEMS [28] and a second verification is done using a comparison with the results obtained using the SC8R solid-shell element ofABAQUS©software.Table 4summarizes the results by comparing the normal displacement at the center of the strip (point E) to the reference solution and to those obtained usingABAQUS©by means of the SC8R solid-shell FE model. The displacement field obtained using the presentSCH8γ7element is of a very good accuracy. We can see from Table 4, that even with only 1 element per edge AE, the obtained deflection (−0.807mm) presents an error less than 23.9% compared to NAFEMS reference solution, while the obtained solution usingABAQUS©solid-shell element, gave an error of 67.5%. The error vanishes as the number of element increases (only through the edge, while keeping only 1 element in the thickness), for only 9 elements per edge AE we obtained a deflection (−1.059mm) with an error less than 0.1%.This example demonstrates the applicability of the present solid-shell formulation to analyze a composite structure with ply drop-offs; it consists on a composite multilayered plate (with 6 layers) with ply drop-offs (Fig. 13).In this example, each layer is made of unidirectional fiber-reinforced material [40], with the fiber directions aligned at+45/−45/+45/−45/+45/−45°with respect to the length direction. The structure, with length L=12m, width b=6m and thickness h=0.1m is clamped on its thicker side and the free thinner end is subjected to a transverse normal load distribution uniformly along the free edge equivalent to a concentrated force of F=600N. The location of the ply drop-offs are at x=4m and x=8m with the top two layers removed after each drop-off. The layer material properties are given in Table 5.Table 6shows the computed solution obtained using the developedSCH8γ7solid-shell model with 12×6 elements (12 along the length and 6 elements along the width). One can observe that the present model can predict accurately the global deflection even for a very thin structure (L/h=12/0.004=3000). Comparison of the maximal deflection obtained with the present model with the one obtained usingABAQUS©SC8R solid-shell element with the same mesh (Fig. 13), gave a small error of only 2.4%, which shows that the present model is free of shear locking.In this application a warped thick cylinder submitted to an internal pressure is studied [28]. The continuum shell model employs one single element with a composite section based on two single-layers through the thickness. The structure is composed of an inner isotropic cylinder E=210GPa,ν=0.3and an outer orthotropic circumferentially wound cylinder having the following material parameters, expressed in a cylindrical coordinate system: a circumferential modulusE11=130GPa, a longitudinal and a transverse moduliE22=E33=5GPa(as indicated in Fig. 14),ν12=ν13=0.25,ν23=0,G12=G13=10GPa, andG23=5GPa. The boundary conditions correspond to a displacementdz=0at z=0 and the cylinder is subjected to an internal pressure of 200MPa (Fig. 14).At first and prior to the optimization of the material parameters, the cylinder is modeled using the initial material data and a mesh of 40 elements through its circumference, 10 elements through the length and only 1 element in thickness direction. The circumferential stress at z=0 is measured for 2 radius values (R=23mm, R=27mm) and compared to the NAFEMS reference solution [28] and to the one obtained using theABAQUS©SC8R solid-shell FE model.For the inner flange we obtainS11=1534.8MPa, the SC8RABAQUS©gaveS11=1477MPa, while the reference solution was 1565MPa. For the outer flange we obtainS11=892.8MPa, theABAQUS©solution wasS11=900MPa, while the reference solution was 875MPa. These results confirm that our solid-shell model and the used mesh are good enough to carry out the optimization process.The optimization problem consists in finding optimal fiber orientation angleθof the outer orthotropic circumferentially wound layer and the Young's modulus E of the inner isotropic cylinder while keeping constant the cylinder expansion for z=0mm at a value ofuR=0.5mm. The objective function is based on the general Hill criterion [42].(50)J(θ,E)=J=∑e=1nelJewhere e is the element index, nel is the total number of elements on the whole structure, the element OF is given by(51)Je=F(S22−S33)2+G(S33−S11)2+H(S11−S22)2+2NS122+2LS232+2MS312The design variables (x1=θ,x2=E) are constrained between0°≤θ≤90°and60GPa≤E≤300GPa. Before performing the optimization procedure, a DOE based on composite design (Fig. 15a) built of 9 functions evaluations for the full cylinder, is carried out. In this case we used 3 groups of design points (4 two-level factorial design points, 4 axial points and a 1 center point). Then design variables are coded as (−1, +1) in order to facilitate the data treatment. The DOE plan with the OF values is given in Table 7.Fig. 16shows the global quadratic response surface model based on DA which has been calculated and given explicitly byJ˜(θ,E)=291900+4107.30θ+1842.52E−7520.69θE−10230.38θ2−261.44E2The response approximation function for the constraint (uR=0.5) on the radial displacement of the cylinder at z=0 is also carried out using (DA) and given explicitly by (see Fig. 17).u˜(θ,E)=0.49+0.026θ+0.071E+0.13θE−0.13θ2−0.098E2The minimization ofJ˜(θ,E)under constraintu˜(θ,E)=0.5(see Fig. 18) has been done using the SQP algorithm based on the work of Powell [31], the optimal solution was obtained in 5 iterations leading to the optimal solution in coded form (0.830, 0.961) which corresponds to(θ⁎,E⁎)=(82.34°,295.40GPa).Fig. 19shows the hoop stress distribution on the cylinder before and after optimization. We can observe just a few amount of stress reduction is obtained after optimization, this is due to the presence of the constraintu˜(θ,E)=0.5which cannot lead to the minimum of the unconstrained objective functionJ˜(θ,E).The structure is a thick composite multilayered shell (Fig. 20), composed by two layers having the same thickness. The lower layer is made of an aluminum alloy 6066-T651 (E=67GPa,ν=0.34) and the upper layer is an orthotropic lightweight based aramid fibers with strong characteristics (E11=130GPa,E22=E33=5GPa,ν12=ν13=0.25,ν23=0,G23=5GPaandG12=G13=10GPa).The structure is submitted to a transverse load in point A of 4.17N/mm, and clamped at its end BC. The structure was meshed using 1596 3D-shell elements corresponding to 3588 nodes (Fig. 20).Prior to performing the material optimization, a FE model validation is carried out using initial material parameters. A numerical comparison of our results to those obtained withABAQUS©software by means of the SC8R solid-shell model is performed. Fig. 21shows the deflection of the strip panel under the maximal load. Comparison of the deflection value obtained using the presentSCH8γ7solid-shell model gave 13.747mm which is in good agreement with 13.676mm obtained usingABAQUS©.The optimization problem consists in finding optimal fiber orientation angleθof the upper orthotropic lightweight based aramid layer and the Young's modulus E of the lower aluminum alloy layer, while the maximal deflection under load is maintained equal to 15mm. The objective function is based on the general Hill criterion [1] and defined by Eq. (51).The optimization problem is stated us(52)MinimizeJ(θ,E)=∑e=1nelJe,(θ,E)∈Rnwithu(θ,E)−15mm≥0,−22.5°≤θ≤+22.5°,60GPa≤E≤79GPa.The response surface model based on DA is built up using the same DOE based on central composite design using 9 experiments. Fig. 22shows the approximated RSM calculated which is given by the quadratic metamodelJ˜(θ,E)=939800+58864.99θ+29763.57E+11549.15θE+146500θ2+1431.34E2The response approximation for the constraint (u(x)−15=0) has been also carried out using DA by means of a quadratic metamodel, it is given explicitly byu˜(θ,E)=13.08+3θ−1.22E−0.17θE+4.58θ2+0.14E2The optimal solution obtained after un-normalizing the DV corresponds to(θ⁎,E⁎)=(3.40°,60.12GPa), the displacement obtained for the optimal structure is aboutu⁎=15.11mmwhich respects the imposed constraintu≥15(Fig. 23).In this application, a composite leaf spring for automobile suspension is studied. The structure shown in Fig. 24with a 10mm constant thickness is made of a composite orthotropic material whose mechanical characteristics are given in Table 8. The optimization problem here, consists in finding the best orientation of the material fibers which allows reducing the maximal stresses over the structure under ultimate loading conditions.The FE mesh using 1220 solid-shell elements and the boundary conditions and loading are shown in Fig. 24. The structure supports a concentrated force at its free end (applied on the bottom shell surface) of 500N, the other edge being clamped.Prior to the optimization process, the FE model has been validated using initial material parameters with an orientation angleθ=0°with reference to the global x-axis (Fig. 24). A first analysis is carried out usingABAQUS©software and its SC8R solid-shell element with the same mesh. Fig. 25shows the stress distribution on the top flange of the structure in the 1st principal direction. Comparison of maximal values of S11 obtained using the present solid-shell model gave 185.79MPa which is almost the same maximal value 185.41MPa obtained with the SC8R element ofABAQUS©.Unlike the stress S11, the distribution of the transverse stress S33 in the thickness direction, shows that a maximal value of 20MPa is reached, while theABAQUS©solution indicates zero stress as indicated in Fig. 26(This results from the fact that the SC8R solid-shell element ofABAQUS©is based on plane stress condition). Analysis of other stress components shows small values compared to the principal stress S11 values and a comparison withABAQUS©results shows good agreement. This first study confirms that the present model is valid and therefore the optimization process can be performed.In order to minimize the number of design variables, a 1-dimensional parameterization is used through the curvilinear abscissa s where 5 DVs are defined as indicated in Fig. 27. The points represented byθ1,θ2,…,θ5are the optimization poles of control, where the fibers orientation angleθiis defined. Inside each finite element, the fiber orientation angleθeis calculated using a linear interpolation between two successive poles where the element is located. For instance, if an element is located between two polesθiandθj, the material orientation angle inside the element is defined asθ(s)=s−sisj−siθi+sj−ssj−siθjHere again, the objective function is based on the Hill criterion [1] and defined by Eq. (51). Thus the optimization problem can be stated in terms of the DV vectorθ={θ1;θ2;θ3;θ4;θ5}as follows:(53)MinimizeJ(θ)=∑e=1nelJe,θ∈Rnwith−60°≤θi≤+60°,i=1,5In order to reduce the number of evaluations of the OF, a DOE based on the Box-Behnken algorithm is used with three levels coded between {−1, 0, +1} (Fig. 15b). The Box-Behnken DOE with 5 variables, allows a screening of only 46 experiments (or combination of variables) coded between −1 and 1. The quadratic response surface model based on DA is built up using the above mentioned DOE based on 46 experiments in the space of 5 coded DV. Fig. 28shows the approximated RSM calculated and given by the following quadratic metamodel:J˜(θ)=1874.04−1206.35θ1−2210.64θ2−1240.79θ3−331.03θ4−71.52θ5+2146.90θ1θ2+0.42θ1θ3+1.50θ1θ4+0.30θ1θ5+1281.27θ2θ3+4.25θ2θ4+1.14θ2θ5+444.04θ3θ4+2.08θ3θ5+64.00θ4θ5+1245.75θ12+2475.70θ22+1375.84θ32+269.35θ42−31.33θ52The minimization of the resulting metamodel was carried out with two different algorithms, namely the VF02AD algorithm using the SQP method [31] and a second optimizer based on the simplex algorithm. Different initial points were used to minimize the OF, and the best result obtained after minimization corresponds toθ⁎={15.77°;15.45°;17.33°;15.19°;0.00°}.After obtaining the optimal material fibers orientations, we carried out a last FE calculation using optimal solutionθ⁎found, by means of the developedSCH8γ7solid-shell model. Review of the principal results is given in Table 9, where maximal stresses in all principal directions are compared to values obtained using the initial material data withθ=0°. As we can observe, the optimal fibers orientation, allow a reduction of the maximal stress distribution in the structure, we found also that the obtained results if physically good since the orientation of the material fibers follows the general orientation of the structure geometry.
