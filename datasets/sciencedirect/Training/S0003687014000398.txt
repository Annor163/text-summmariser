Prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome among employees at a poultry processing plant

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
This cross-sectional evaluation offers detailed exposure measures of each participant.A multipart case definition that included nerve conduction testing was utilized.Increasing levels of hand activity and force were associated with increased CTS prevalence among participants.This evaluation demonstrates the need to reduce employee exposure to levels of hand activity and force.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) among poultry processing employees while taking into account non-occupational factors and assess any association between CTS prevalence and exposure groups.MethodsPerformed a cross-sectional survey to assess CTS (n = 318). A CTS case was defined as an employee with self-reported CTS symptoms, an abnormal hand symptom diagram, and an abnormal nerve conduction study (NCS). Log-binomial regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios.ResultsThree hundred and one participants had sufficient symptom information or NCS data to be classified. 126 (42%) of 301 participants had evidence of CTS. In the adjusted analysis, the highest exposure group had CTS prevalence that was significantly higher than that for the lower exposure group [PR: 1.61; 95% CI = (1.20, 2.17)].ConclusionsIncreasing levels of hand activity and force were associated with increased CTS prevalence among participants. Recommendations were provided to reduce exposure to these risk factors.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Across all U.S. industries, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) resulted in the highest number of lost workdays (25 or more days per case) in 2011 and continues to be a major cause of disability and cost to society (Bonfiglioli et al., 2013). Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most commonly reported peripheral nerve entrapment neuropathy (Herbert et al., 2000).On the basis of a review of several epidemiologic studies, there is evidence for positive associations between exposure to workplace factors such as repetition, force, and posture and CTS (NIOSH, 1997). Poultry work is highly repetitive and involves forceful movements and awkward postures, and puts employees at risk for CTS (Armstrong et al., 2008; Burt et al., 2011; Cartwright et al., 2012; Lipscomb et al., 2008). Previous work has found that certain medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease have been associated with CTS (Becker et al., 2002; Karpitskaya et al., 2002). Other individual risk factors for CTS include sex and age (Atcheson et al., 1998).In 2011, approximately 224,000 U.S. poultry employees slaughtered approximately nine billion birds for human consumption (BLS, 2012; USDA, 2008). In the 1960s, 85% of broiler chickens were sold as whole carcass. At that time, only 13% were sold as cut-up parts. By 1990, only 18% were sold as whole carcass and 56% were now sold as cut-up parts (USDA, 1998). Additionally, poultry meat processing has dramatically increased within rural areas of the southern U.S. in recent decades (McPhee and Lipscomb, 2009; Owens et al., 2010).As part of a 2012 health hazard evaluation (HHE) requested by plant management, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) investigators determined the prevalence of CTS among poultry processing employees. This workplace HHE was conducted by NIOSH investigators following the authorizing federal regulations found in 42 CFR 85. The HHE request was required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to obtain an evisceration line speed waiver approval as part of its Salmonella Initiative Program.The objective of our evaluation was to determine prevalence of CTS among poultry processing employees using an epidemiologic case definition while taking into account non-occupational factors and assess any association between CTS prevalence and exposure groups. A CTS case was defined as an employee with self-reported CTS symptoms, an abnormal hand symptom diagram, and an abnormal nerve conduction study (NCS).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Forty-two percent of participating poultry processing employees had evidence of CTS, and 41% of participants were working in jobs above the ACGIH TLV for hand activity and force. Also, increasing levels of hand activity and force were associated with increased CTS prevalence among participants. Despite repeated studies in this industry in the past 20 years finding high prevalence of CTS, poultry processing jobs continue to be hazardous. OSHA has had guidance for preventing MSDs in the poultry industry since early 2000 (OSHA, 2013). Likewise, the National Chicken Council and the Poultry and Egg Institute have long standing workplace recommendations regarding ergonomics and injury prevention (National Chicken Council, 2008; The Poultry & Egg Institute, 2013). We found that many of these recommendations were not being followed; that employees at this plant were exposed to hand activity and force levels above the recommended TLV, and those employees were not adequately followed up medically. We provided several recommendations to the plant to reduce employee exposure to levels of hand activity and force, including: (1) designing job tasks so that they are below the ACGIH TLV; (2) automating or semi-automating front half deboning and thigh deboning tasks; (3) employing a job rotation schedule in which employees rotate between jobs that use different muscle groups and that are below the AL of the ACGIH TLV; and (4) instituting a medical surveillance program for MSDs to monitor employee health and determine the effectiveness of exposure prevention and medical management strategies. The challenge to the industry is to design poultry processing work to reduce risk factors for MSDs and to closely follow existing guidelines for prevention, early recognition, and medical management of MSDs.
