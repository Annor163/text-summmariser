@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Computer users are often under stress when required to complete computer work within a required time. Work stress has repeatedly been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The present study examined the effects of time pressure workload during computer tasks on cardiac activity in 20 healthy subjects. Heart rate, time domain and frequency domain indices of heart rate variability (HRV) and Poincaré plot parameters were compared among five computer tasks and two rest periods. Faster heart rate and decreased standard deviation of R–R interval were noted in response to computer tasks under time pressure. The Poincaré plot parameters showed significant differences between different levels of time pressure workload during computer tasks, and between computer tasks and the rest periods. In contrast, no significant differences were identified for the frequency domain indices of HRV. The results suggest that the quantitative Poincaré plot analysis used in this study was able to reveal the intrinsic nonlinear nature of the autonomically regulated cardiac rhythm. Specifically, heightened vagal tone occurred during the relaxation computer tasks without time pressure. In contrast, the stressful computer tasks with added time pressure stimulated cardiac sympathetic activity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The use of computers is becoming an essential part of industrial, office and daily life. Computer work with clicking and moving a mouse generally involves a high demand of visual, motor and cognitive coordination. In many situations, the users are under stressful pressure to complete the computer work within a required time. The consequences of such mental stress include tension, irritability, inability to concentrate and a variety of physical symptoms usually reflected by a headache or an increased heart rate (HR). Porges described stress as an autonomic state that reflects a disruption of homeostasis due to depressed parasympathetic tone [1]. Workload-related stress often produces changes in behavioral (e.g., higher error rates) [2,3] and physiological (e.g., faster heartbeat) functions [4,5]. Thus, the degree of stress can be mirrored from behavior performance and can be quantified on a physiological level.HR and HR variability (HRV) allow the discrimination among levels of mental stress induced by workload [6–11]. Although HRV analysis has been a popular tool for assessing mental stress, the conventional spectral analysis in HRV has not yet reached a conclusion regarding the frequency components specific to the time pressure [7,9,10]. It still remains unclear how could HR change without an appropriate and assessable change in its autonomic modulation reflected on the spectral characteristics of HRV [7,9,10]. Heiden et al. [7] investigated the influences of time pressure and precision demands during computer-mouse work on muscle oxygenation and position sense in the upper extremity and found that HRV did not differ in the low and high frequency bands [7]. Garde et al. demonstrated that carrying out computer tasks under mental pressure did not result in any changes in the low and high frequency components in the normalized power spectra [10]. Similar results were reported by Wahlström and colleagues [9], where no significant difference in the ratio of low and high frequency components was noted between the control and stress conditions in the Stroop colour word test under time pressure and verbal provocation. Nevertheless, some studies have reported that the frequency components of HRV changed as a result of adding memory demands to a computer task [6,8,11,12].One possibility for such an inconsistency is the nonlinear properties of HRV [13–15]. Consequently, the linear spectral analysis may not be able to uncover subtle but important alterations and anomalies in HR time series. Searchable literatures have reported the advantages of nonlinear methods, such as detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), approximate entropy (ApEn) and Poincaré plot analysis, over the linear spectral analysis [16–19]. Nonlinear techniques are able to distinguish groups that have no differences in their spectra [17,19]. However, the physiological connection between the scaling factor of DFA or information entropy and the cardiac activities is indirect. Moreover, a larger data length was required for some nonlinear indices, such as DFA and ApEn [20]. Thus, an efficacious nonlinear measure is required for better physiological understanding of cardiac activities during lab experiments. As a simple yet powerful nonlinear measure, the quantifications of the Poincaré plot have recently been proposed to characterize the vagal modulation of R–R interval dynamics [18,19,21,22]. The Poincaré plot provides a useful visualisation of HRV by representing both short- and long-term variations in the R–R intervals, and its geometrical representations can reflect the cardiac behavior, e.g., a normal or reduced cardiac autonomic modulation [23]. Meanwhile, a physiological model for the Poincaré plot has been established and tested by Brennan and colleagues, in which the Poincaré plot is linked to the weighted combination of low and high frequency components in HRV [24].The aim of this study was to investigate the cardiac activities during computer work under time pressure. Additionally, we attempted to analyze the reason for the failure of spectral measures in discriminating the levels of computer work stress under different time pressures.
