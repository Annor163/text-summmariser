@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this note we study the regularity of generalized Hermite interpolation and compare it to that of classical Hermite interpolation.While every Hermite interpolation scheme is regular in one variable, the “classical Hermite interpolation schemes” in several variables are regular if and only if they are supported at one point. In this note we exhibit some regular generalized Hermite interpolation schemes supported at two points and study some limitation of existence of such schemes. The existence of such schemes provides a class of counterexamples to a conjecture of Jia and Sharma.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this note we will compare the regularity properties of generalized Hermite interpolation (as introduced in de Boor and Ron, 1991) to those of classical Hermite interpolation (cf. Lorentz and Lorentz, 1990; Lorentz, 2000). The classical Hermite interpolation schemes in several variables are regular if and only if they are supported at one point (cf. Lorentz, 2000). We show that this is still the case for generalized Hermite interpolation over the complex field and no longer the case over the real field. In particular, we study regular generalized Hermite interpolation schemes supported at two points. We also present some necessary conditions for the existence of such schemes. The constructed schemes provide a class of counterexamples to a conjecture made in Jia and Sharma (1991).Some notations and terminology: The symbolkwill stand for either the real fieldRor the complex fieldCandZ+will denote the set of non-negative integers. We letk[x]:=k[x1,…,xd]be the algebra of polynomials in d variables with coefficients ink. Thus everyp∈k[x]could be written as a finite sump(x)=∑αpˆ(α)xαwhereα:=(α1,…,αd)∈Z+d,xα:=x1α1⋯xdαdand the coefficientspˆ(α)∈k. For every p∈k[x]we usep¯to denote the complex conjugate of the polynomial p. Thus ifp(x)=∑pˆ(α)xαthenp¯(x)=∑pˆ‾(α)xαwherec¯is the complex conjugate of c. We useDjto denote the partial derivative with respect toxjand for every p∈k[x]the symbolp(D)denotes the differential operatorp(D1,…,Dd)=∑αpˆ(α)D1α1…Ddαdacting onk[x]. Finally, forz∈kdwe useδzto denote the point-evaluation functional:δz(p):=p(z)for allp∈k[x].A subspaceP⊂k[x]is called D-invariant ifDjp∈Pfor everyp∈Pandj=1,…,d. For anyF⊂k[x]we useD(F)to denote the least D-invariant subspace ofk[x]that contains F.A generalized Hermite interpolation is determined by a finite-dimensional D-invariant subspaceP⊂k[x], a finite set of D-invariant subspacesP1,…,PsofPsuch that(1.1)dim⁡P=∑i=1sdim⁡Piand a finite sequence of distinct pointsZ=(z1,…,zs)∈(kd)s. We consider the problem of interpolation from the spacePwith interpolation conditions given by the direct sum(1.2)A(Z,Pj,j=1,…,s):=∑j=1s{δzj∘p¯(D):p∈Pj},i.e., for any f∈k[x]we wish to findp∈Psuch thatλ(f)=λ(p)for allλ∈A(Z,Pj,j=1,…,k).In particular, ifdim⁡Pj=1for all j then (by D-invariance) eachPjis spanned by the constant function 1 and hence the Hermite interpolation problem becomes a Lagrange interpolation problem at the pointsZ. If, on the other hand,s=1this means that we are interpolating various derivatives of a function at one point; we will refer to such interpolation as (generalized) Taylor interpolation.We follow G. Lorentz (1989) (cf. also Jia and Sharma, 1991) and say that the interpolation schemeS:=S(P,P1,…,Ps)is regular if the interpolation problem fromPwith interpolation conditionsA(Z,Pj,j=1,…,s)is uniquely solvable for any sequence of pairwise distinct pointsZand any f∈k[x]. The interpolation scheme is almost regular if the interpolation problem is uniquely solvable for one (and therefore almost all) sequences of pointsZ=(z1,…,zs)in(kd)s. In the remaining case the interpolation scheme is singular.Condition (1.1) assures that the number of interpolation conditions is the same as the dimension of the spacePwhile the D-invariance ofPi-s is a necessary and sufficient condition for the setJ:={f∈k[x]:λ(f)=0for allλ∈A(Z,Pj,j=1,…,s)}to be a (zero-dimensional) ideal ink[x].In one variable this notion of Hermite interpolation coincides with the classical Hermite interpolation since the only finite-dimensional D-invariant subspaces ofk[x]are polynomials of fixed maximal degree and are always regular. The classical Hermite interpolation problem in several variables (when all subspaces in question are polynomials of fixed degree) had been a subject of intensive study in recent years in Approximation theory (cf. Lorentz and Lorentz, 1990; Lorentz, 1992, 2000) as well as in algebraic geometry (cf. Alexander and Hirschowitz, 1995; Harris, 2011). In this article we will compare and contrast some of the results on regularity of classical multivariate Hermite interpolation problems to those of generalized ones.One final note: choosing a basis(p1,…,pN)forPand a basisλ1[Z],…,λN[Z]forA(Z,Pj,j=1,…,s)consider the generalized Vandermonde determinant(1.3)ΔS(z1,…,zs):=det⁡(λj[Z](pk))j,k=1N.This is a polynomial ind×svariables:(z1,1,…,z1,d,…,zs,1,…,zs,d)∈Csd,wherezj=(zj,1,…,zj,d),j=1,…,s.The regularity of a schemeS(P,P1,…,Ps)is equivalent to the non-vanishing of this polynomial for all distinctz1,…,zs. The schemeSis singular if and only ifΔSis identically zero.It is a well-known fact that in one dimension the Hermite interpolation scheme is always regular while ford>1the classical Hermite interpolation scheme is regular if and only if it is a Taylor scheme, i.e.,Zconsists of one point. In this section we will show that this fact still holds for generalized Hermite interpolation in the complex setting (k=C) and fails in the real setting (k=R). The latter gives a counterexample to a conjecture of Jia and Sharma (cf. Jia and Sharma, 1991).We will need the following rudimentary facts from algebraic geometry: A subsetV⊂kNis called an affine variety if there exists a finite set of polynomialsf1,…,fsink[x1,…,xN]such thatV={x∈kN:f1(x)=⋯=fs(x)=0};the union of affine varieties is an affine variety (cf. Cox et al., 1997, p. 188, Theorem 15) and with every affine varietyVwe can associate the integerdim⁡V(cf. Cox et al., 1997, Chapter 9).Lemma 2.1Forj=1,…,sletzj=(zj,1,…,zj,d)∈Cd. Let(2.1)U:={(z1,1,…,z1,d,…,zs,1,…,zs,d)∈Csd:zj≠zmforj≠m}.Then(2.2)W:=Uc=Csd\Uis an affine variety inCsdand(2.3)dim⁡W:=sd−d.ProofFor everyj≠m,j,m=1,…,sconsider the linear subspace (hence an affine variety)Wj,m⊂Csddefined by the d linear equations:zj−zm=0; i.e.,Wj,m={(z1,1,…,z1,d,…,zs,1,…,zs,d)∈Csd:zj,i−zm,i=0,i=1,…,d}Thendim⁡Wj,m=sd−dforj≠m. Observe thatWis a finite union of these varieties:W=∪j,m=1sWj,m,henceWis an affine variety and (cf. Cox et al., 1997, p. 462, Corollary 9)dim⁡W=max⁡{dim⁡Wj,m,j,m=1,…,s}=sd−dwhich proves the lemma.  □Theorem 2.2Letk=Candd≥2. Then the schemeS(P,P1,…,Ps)is regular if and only if it is a Taylor scheme, i.e.,s=1.ProofSuppose thats>1. Then, by D-invariance ofPi-s, the scheme contains at least two point evaluations, say at the pointsz1andz2. Chooseλ1=δz1andλ2=δz1in (1.3) to be the point evaluations at these points. Ifz1=z2the determinant (1.3) contains two identical rows, hence vanishes, and the polynomialΔSis not a non-zero constant. Thus the dimension of the zero-setZ(ΔS)is an affine variety of dimension at leastsd−1. And, sinced>1, we have(2.4)dim⁡Z(ΔS)≥sd−1>sd−d=dim⁡(Uc)whereUis defined in (2.1). ThusΔSvanishes on some pointsZinUwhich shows thatSis not regular.  □Note that ford=1the inequality in (2.4) is an equality.Theorem 2.3Ifk=RandN>d+1then there exists a regular generalized Hermite schemeS(P,P1,P2)withdim⁡P=N.ProofFirst consider the case whenN=d(mod2)and define(2.5)P:=D(∑i=1dxi2ki)for some integerski≥1. ThenPis spanned by the set of polynomials(2.6){1,xini,∑i=1dxi2ki,i=1,…,d,ni=1,…,2ki−1},hencedim⁡P=2+2(∑i=1dki)−d>d+1.The assumptionN=d(mod2)shows that we can always findki-s such thatN=dim⁡P. Now choose(2.7)P1:=span{1,1ni!xini,i=1,…,d,ni=1,,2ki−1}andP2:=span{1}.This scheme interpolates all the derivatives1ni!Diniof a function at one pointz1and the value of the function at another pointz2. We want to show that for distinct pointsz1andz2the determinantΔS(z1,z2)≠0. SinceP1andP2are D-invariant, they are translation invariant. Hence, we can assume without loss of generality thatz1=0. Thus we need to show thatΔS(0,z)≠0ifz=(z1,…,zd)≠0. Evaluating the determinant (1.3) with the basis forPgiven by (2.6) and the basis for Λ by (2.7) we haveΔS(0,z)=det⁡[I(N−1)×(N−1)0u∑i=1dzi2ki]=∑i=1dzi2kiwhere u is an(N−1)×(N−1)row vectoru=(1,zini,∑i=1dzi2ki,i=1,…,d,ni=1,…,2ki−1).HenceΔS(0,z)=0if and only ifz=0To prove the result forN−1=d(mod2)it is sufficient to add the monomialx1x2to the bases ofPandP1. The rest of the proof remains the same.Finally, ifs=1, then the interpolation conditions are given by the same polynomials asPand, for a givenz∈Rd, it is easy to find a basis(p1,…pN)forPand the “dual basis”(p1⁎,…,pN⁎)forPsuch thatpj⁎(D)pk(z)=δj,kfor allj,k=1,…,N.  □The types of schemes constructed in the proof of the theorem are not the only ones. For instance, it is easy to check by direct computations (cf. Shekhtman, 2005) that the schemesS(P,P1,P2)withP=span{1,x,x2+y,x3+3xy2},P1=P2=span{1,x}andP=span{1,x,y,x2−y2},P1=span{1,x}andP1=span{1,y}are regular inR[x,y]. On the other hand it was proved in Jia and Sharma (1991) that ifPis spanned by monomials then Taylor schemes are the only regular Hermite schemes. Meierhuber's theorem (cf. Mairhuber, 1956) asserts that there are no regular Lagrange schemes in dimension 2 or greater with more then one point.Problem 2.4It would be interesting to find a complete description of regular generalized Hermite schemes inR[x].To that end it is easy to see that ifdim⁡P≤dthenPdoes not support a regular Hermite schemeS(P,P1,…,Ps)that is not Taylor. Indeed, ifs>1then the D-invariance ofP1andP2implies that both subspaces contain 1, hence the interpolation conditions have at least two point evaluations among them. Thus, if(1,p1,…,pd−1)is a basis forP, the determinant (1.3) contains at least two rows of the form(1,p1(z),…,pd−1(z))and sincep:=(p1,…,pd−1):Rd→Rd−1is continuous, it is not injective. Hence there exist distinctz1,z2such thatp(z1)=p(z2)andΔS(z1,…,zs)contains two identical rows, thus vanishes.Next we will extend this to the casedim⁡P≤d+1thus showing that the assumption on N in Theorem 2.3 is best possible. A soft topological argument ford=2can be found in Shekhtman (2005). Unfortunately, ford>2we could only come up with a clumsy computational proof:Lemma 2.5Suppose thatPis a D-invariant subspace ofR[x1,…,xd]withN:=dim⁡P≤d+1. Then there exists a linear change of variablesX1,…,Xdsuch that either(2.8)P⊂R[X1,…,Xd−1]or(2.9)P=Q⊕span{Xd}.withQ⊂R[X1,…,Xd−1].ProofLet t be a maximal number of linearly independent linear forms inP, denoted byX1,…,Xt. Ift=dthen, sincePis D-invariant, it contains 1 and sincePis at most(d+1)-dimensional, it follows thatP=span{1,X1,…,Xd}and the claim is obvious. OtherwiseP, being D-invariant, must contain a quadratic polynomial inX1,…,Xt. Since the derivatives of these polynomials must be linear, each of them must be of the formp(X1,…,Xt)+Xpwhere p is a quadratic polynomial andXpis linear form. Notice that each of these polynomials is of the type (2.8) or (2.9). Thus the cubic polynomials must be of the formq(X1,…,Xt)+l(X1,…,Xt)Xp+Xq,where q is a cubic polynomial and l is a linear polynomial. This means that for each new linear formXpwe need two polynomials, quadratic and cubic, to get it in a monomial of degree greater than 1. So, if there ared−tlinearly independent linear terms that complementspan{X1,…,Xt}and each is contained in some monomial of degree greater then 1 thendim⁡P≥1+t+2(d−t)=1+d+(d−t)henced=t.  □Theorem 2.6IfS(P,P1,…,Ps)is regular inR[x1,…,xd]andN:=dim⁡P≤d+1thenSis a Taylor scheme.ProofAssume thats>1and, by the previous lemma,P=Q⊕span{xd}whereQ⊂R[x1,…,xd−1]. Since no derivatives ofp∈Pcould contain the term withxdit follows that the determinantΔS(z1,…,zs)=φ(z˜1,…,z˜s)+∑j=1sφj(z˜1,…,z˜s)zj,dwherez˜jdenotes the orthogonal projection ofzj=(zj,1,…,zj,d)onto the firstd−1coordinates and φ andφjare polynomials inz˜1,…,z˜s.Now ifφj(z˜1,…,z˜s)≠0for some(z˜1,…,z˜s)and somej=1,…,sthen, by continuity ofφj, we can choose(z1,…,zs)so thatz˜1,…,z˜sare distinct and solve the linear equation inz1,d,…,zs,d:φ(z˜1,…,z˜s)+∑j=1sφj(z˜1,…,z˜s)zj,d=0hence obtaining distinctz1,…,zson which the determinantΔS(z1,…,zs)vanishes. Next assume thatφj(z˜1,…,z˜s)=0for all j and allz˜1,…,z˜s. ThenΔS(z1,…,zs)=φ(z˜1,…,z˜s)=0ifz1=z2=0. HenceΔS(z1,…,zs)=0ifz˜1=z˜2=0and it remains to choose distinct last coordinatesz1,d,…,zs,dto obtain distinctz1,…,zson which the determinantΔS(z1,…,zs)=0.  □Problem 2.7Is there a regular generalized Hermite interpolation scheme supported at three points?So far we failed to construct any such schemes.A few words about singular schemes. Recall that a schemeS(P,P1,…,Ps)is singular if the determinant (1.3) vanishes for all sequences of pointsZ. Hence the linear functionalsλ1[Z],…,λN[Z]that form a basis forA(Z,Pj,j=1,…,s)are linearly dependent overP, i.e., there exist coefficient(ai(Z),i=1,…,N)such that(3.1)∑i=1Nai(Z)λi[Z]=0overP. A standard example of a classical singular interpolation scheme is(P,P1,P2)wherePis the space of polynomials of degree at most two andP1=P2={1,x,y}. These kinds of schemes are rare and the classification of all such schemes is an active area of research in approximation theory (cf. Lorentz, 2000; Gevorgian et al., 1996) as well as in algebraic geometry (cf. Alexander and Hirschowitz, 1995; Harris, 2011). In terms of algebraic geometry, this work accumulated in the famous Harbourne–Hirschowitz conjecture (cf. Alexander and Hirschowitz, 1995). In contrast singular generalized schemes exist for all spacesP⊂k[x1,…,xd]of polynomials of degree at most N andd>1with a singular exception ofN=1,d=2. Indeed, the schemeS(P,P1,P2,…,Ps)withP1=P2={1,x1,,x1N}is always singular since the values of(Dx1Nf)(z)do not depend on z hence the corresponding determinantΔS(z1,…,zs)contains two identical rows and is identically zero. In particular it follows that ifPis the space of polynomials of degree at most N then it has singular scheme supported at s points for(3.2)2≤s≤dim⁡Pn+1,namelyP1=…=Ps={1,x1,…,x1N}. Of course these schemes are trivially singular since two of the functionals inA(Z,Pj,j=1,…,s), namelyδz1∘Dx1Nandδz2∘Dx1N, are identical overP, hence the functionals inA(Z,Pj,j=1,…,s)are linearly dependent. Moreover the coefficientsai(Z)in (3.1) do not depend onZ. In contrast for the scheme(P,P1,P2)wherePis the space of polynomials of degree at most two andP1=P2={1,x,y}the coefficientai,bisuch thata0δz1+a1(δz1∘Dx1)+a2(δz1∘Dx2)+b0δz2+b1(δz2∘Dx1)+b2(δz2∘Dx2)=0over the space of polynomials of degree at most 2 do depend onZ.There are two more types of singular generalized Hermite scheme in polynomials of degree 2 where the coefficients do depend onZ:1)P1={1,X,X2},P2={1,Y,Y2},P1={1,X,X2+Y},P2={1,X,X2−Y},Symbolic computations suggest that these schemes together with the classical one:P1=P2={1,X,Y}are the only singular interpolation schemes(P,P1,P2)on the spaceP⊂k[x,y]of polynomials of degree at most two supported at two points.Here is another example of a singular scheme(P,P1,P2):P=D(xy),P1=span{1,x},P2=span{1,y}.It is easy to check that forN=1,d=2no scheme is singular. It also matches with the fact that the dimension of polynomials of degree at most 1 in two variables is 3 and there is no integer s satisfying (3.2). By (3.2) singular schemes exist in spaces of linear polynomials in three or more variables.
