@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A new non-invasive method for delineation of lentigo maligna and lentigo maligna melanoma is demonstrated. The method is based on the analysis of the hyperspectral images taken in vivo before surgical excision of the lesions. For this, the characteristic features of the spectral signatures of diseased pixels and healthy pixels are extracted, which combine the intensities in a few selected wavebands with the coefficients of the wavelet frame transforms of the spectral curves. To reduce dimensionality and to reveal the internal structure of the datasets, the diffusion maps technique is applied. The averaged Nearest Neighbor and the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) classifiers are utilized as the decision units. To reduce false alarms by the CART classifier, the Aisles procedure is used.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we introduce a non-invasive method for delineation of lentigo maligna (LM) and lentigo maligna-melanoma (LMM). Lentigo maligna is an early form of melanoma in which the malignant cells are confined to the upper part of the skin, the epidermis; hence it is often reported as in situ melanoma. Lentigo maligna melanoma is diagnosed when malignant melanoma cells have invaded the dermis and deeper layers of skin [1]. Both LM and LMM occur as a brown-to-black patch on a sun-damaged skin, typically in the facial area. Clinically LM cannot be differentiated from invasive LMM. Diagnosis is verified by histopathological evaluation of the skin biopsy samples. The lesion borders can be hard to define by eye, due to subclinical extension. Histopathological analyses of the removed lesion reveal the size of the lesion. Often a re-excision is required [2]. There is a need for a noninvasive method for tumor margin delineation before and during the surgery.Eight lesions, 3 LMM and 5 LM, in 8 patients were included in the study. The study protocol followed the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tampere University Hospital District, Finland. The study was conducted in Päijät-Häme Central Hospital, Department of Dermatology and Allergology during 2012–2013.A hand-held hyperspectral imaging system was developed for the study. The hyperspectral sensor was produced by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland [3]. This hyperspectral imager uses a wavelength area between 500 and 885nm, which covers visible light and near infrared area.The presented method is based on processing hyperspectral images. The research follows a manifold learning approach and supervised machine learning process. The process includes data preprocessing, definitions of training set, algorithm selection, training and evaluation with test set [4].This article consists of five sections and two appendices. Section 2 provides a brief review of the related literature. In Section 3, we explain in details our hyperspectral imaging system and the data processing chain. Section 4 presents the results from our clinical trial. Finally, in Section 5, we present our conclusions and planned further development. Appendix A outlines the diffusion maps technique and embedding the new data into diffusion spaces by the Geometric Harmonics method. Outline of the CART algorithm is given in Appendix B.
