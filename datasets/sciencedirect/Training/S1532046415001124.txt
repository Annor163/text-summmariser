@&#ABSTRACT@&#
As healthcare shifts from the hospital to the home, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how patients interact with home medical devices, to inform the safe and patient-friendly design of these devices. Distributed Cognition (DCog) has been a useful theoretical framework for understanding situated interactions in the healthcare domain. However, it has not previously been applied to study interactions with home medical devices. In this study, DCog was applied to understand renal patients’ interactions with Home Hemodialysis Technology (HHT), as an example of a home medical device. Data was gathered through ethnographic observations and interviews with 19 renal patients and interviews with seven professionals. Data was analyzed through the principles summarized in the Distributed Cognition for Teamwork methodology. In this paper we focus on the analysis of system activities, information flows, social structures, physical layouts, and artefacts. By explicitly considering different ways in which cognitive processes are distributed, the DCog approach helped to understand patients’ interaction strategies, and pointed to design opportunities that could improve patients’ experiences of using HHT. The findings highlight the need to design HHT taking into consideration likely scenarios of use in the home and of the broader home context. A setting such as home hemodialysis has the characteristics of a complex and safety–critical socio-technical system, and a DCog approach effectively helps to understand how safety is achieved or compromised in such a system.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the anticipated rise in home healthcare, particularly for chronic conditions [20], there is a need to ensure that home medical devices are designed such that they can be easily and safely used by patients and carers. To inform the design of these devices, it is important to understand how patients and carers currently interact with medical devices in the home environment. Distributed Cognition (DCog) is a theoretical approach that has proven effective for understanding situated interactions in the healthcare domain, in which work is often collaborative, involving both people and technology. However, DCog has not previously been applied to study situated interactions with home medical devices. This study aimed to investigate the utility of DCog for informing the design of home medical devices, taking Home Hemodialysis Technology (HHT) as an example. Through a DCog approach, this study focused on understanding the contexts in which patients interact with HHT, the issues they face, especially those having safety implications, and the interaction strategies they adopt to cope with these issues. The results of the study are presented in terms of five models that describe the contexts in which patients interact with HHT. The next section summarizes the need to understand situated interactions with home medical devices, describes DCog, and gives a background of home hemodialysis.
