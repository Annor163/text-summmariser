@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We propose a novel symmetry-driven Bayesian framework to incorporate structural shape into conventional geometrical shape descriptor of an image indexing and retrieval. We use rotation and reflection symmetries for structural shape description. Symmetry detection on each shape image provides a qualitative and a quantitative categorization of the types and the degrees of symmetry level. The posterior shape similarity enhances the shape matching performance based on the symmetry structural discrimination. Experimental results show statistically significant improvement on retrieval accuracy over the state of the art methods on MPEG-7 data set.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Shape matching is a challenging topic in computer vision. Various shape representations and matching methods have been studied, such as geometrical [1–5]/topological [6–9] and hierarchical [2,10,11]/partial-shape [12–14] descriptors. However, most of previous works concentrate on describing either geometrical or topological shape computing a similarity between two shapes based on their shape descriptors. Our key observation is that a shape cannot be represented solely by either a geometrical or a structural characteristic. Human recognizes a shape not only by its local and global geometrical variations, but also by a high-level understanding of the shape structure like symmetry. Symmetry is a good feature describing global structure of shapes. We immediately can tell the shape difference between butterfly and flower by saying that a flower has rotational symmetry. Among the four primitive symmetry types (Rotation, Reflection, Glide-reflection and Translation) [15], rotation and reflection symmetries are frequently found from the binary image of 2D shape of single object. Fig. 1shows various shape examples from the MPEG7 shape dataset. We can figure out just by taking a look of the images that a shape from one category has its unique and discriminative characteristic in terms of symmetry and can be recognized without any further detailed geometrical shape investigation. Kurki and Saarinen [16] show by psychophysical techniques that rotational symmetry in shape attracts our attention more than other structure. Not only for rotation symmetry, regular structure of all other types of symmetry makes objects or shapes more perceptually salient than other part of an image [17]. Likewise symmetry plays an important role in discriminating structural shapes to each other in the presence of high intra class variance of geometrical shapes (Fig. 2).Despite the important role of symmetry in shape description and recognition, there have been less interests in using symmetry features to represent shape structure and find the correspondence of shapes. This is partly because there have been relatively few robust symmetry detection algorithms. Skeleton-based shape representation methods use the symmetry of local points but they do not capture the global symmetry shape structure [7,8]. Recently, several rotations and reflection symmetry detection algorithms have been proposed [18,15,19–23] and evaluated [24]. Park et al. [24] show a potential of symmetry features on how they can contribute to the popular computer vision problems like object recognition.In this research, we propose a new shape representation and matching framework by unifying structural shape features and conventional geometrical shapes. We employ but are not restricted to the rotation and reflection symmetries for structural shape representation. The contributions of our proposed algorithm includes; (1) the first symmetry shape representation for global structural shape description and (2) a novel framework of shape representation and matching unifying both structural and geometrical shape features of any previous method.
