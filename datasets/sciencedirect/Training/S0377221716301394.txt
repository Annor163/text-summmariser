@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We investigate TU-game solutions that are neutral to collusive agreements among players. A collusive agreement binds collusion members to act as a single player and is feasible when they are connected on a network. Collusion neutrality requires that no feasible collusive agreement can change the total payoff of collusion members. We show that on the domain of network games, there is a solution satisfying collusion neutrality, efficiency and null-player property if and only if the network is a tree. Considering a tree network, we show that affine combinations of hierarchical outcomes (Demange, 2004; van den Brink, 2012) are the only solutions satisfying the three axioms together with linearity. As corollaries, we establish characterizations of the average tree solution (equally weighted average of hierarchical outcomes); one established earlier in the literature and the others new.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Collusive agreements among players in a cooperative game may influence the structure of the game, and as a result, the total payoff of the collusion members may change. This possibility has been raised by Harsanyi (1977) through the joint-bargaining paradox in a bargaining framework; collusive agreements can weaken the bargaining position of the collusion members. The best known solution, the Shapley value, exhibits the same paradoxical feature (Haller, 1994). Different types of collusive agreements have been studied by Haller (1994), Malawski (2002), van den Brink (2009), van den Brink (2012), etc. Here we consider collusive agreements that bind collusion members to act like a single player in such a way that the collusion performs the same role in determining coalitional worths as in the original game if all its members are together; it contributes nothing and performs the role of the empty coalition if any member is missing. Our key axiom, collusion neutrality, requires that no “feasible” collusion can change its total payoff through this collusive agreement.11Malawski (2002) and van den Brink (2009), van den Brink (2012) consider only the collusions of two agents. The corresponding neutrality axiom in our paper is called as pairwise neutrality. Our collusion neutrality pertains to collusions of any number of agents. We consider both collusion neutrality and pairwise neutrality.The most studied solution that is neutral to collusive agreements is the Banzhaf value. Unfortunately, it is not efficient. The characterization of the Banzhaf value in Malawski (2002) implies that if all pairs of agents are feasible collusions, then there is no efficient and neutral solution that satisfies null-player property as well as some other standard axioms. van den Brink (2012) establishes a stronger non-existence result considering only the three axioms, efficiency, neutrality, and null-player property. However, for “tree-restricted games”, namely, games with a restricted coalition formation on a tree network, van den Brink (2012) shows that if only connected collusions on the tree network are feasible, there do exist solutions satisfying the three axioms.22van den Brink (2012) proves the existence with regard to pairwise neutrality. But as he mentions in his concluding remarks, his existence result also holds with our stronger axiom, collusion neutrality.There remain three crucial open questions in this line of research.In van den Brink (2012), both collusive agreements and coalition formation are subject to the same network constraint. Since collusive agreements require strong commitments of members in addition to forming the coalition itself, one may well argue that the constraint for collusive agreements could be stricter than the constraint for coalition formation. This leads to the first question. Will the existence result in van den Brink (2012) go through with different constraints for the collusive agreements and for coalition formation? Of particular interest in our investigation is the environment where only collusive agreements are subject to a network constraint and there is no constraint in coalition formation. Also related with the first question is whether van den Brink’s existence result also holds for non-tree networks. This is the second question. The third question is about the uniqueness. Are the solutions provided in van den Brink (2012) unique ones satisfying the three axioms? Our goal is to answer these three questions.To answer the first two questions, we consider both tree networks as considered by Demange (1994), Demange (2004), Herings, van der Laan, and Talman (2008), and van den Brink (2012), and non-tree networks. Given a connected (tree or non-tree) network, we assume that collusive agreements are feasible only for the collusions that are connected on the network. Considering a tree network, van den Brink (2012) makes the same assumption and investigates the domain of network games (games with restricted coalition formation on the tree network). In our investigation, we consider both the domain of network games and the entire domain of games. The latter domain allows for the possibility that only collusion formation is subject to the network constraint and there is no constraint on coalition formation of games. Our first result shows that on the entire domain of games, the existence of solutions satisfying collusion neutrality, efficiency and null-player property is guaranteed if and only if the network is a line. On the domain of network games, however, we show that there is a solution satisfying the three axioms if and only if the network is a tree. Thus, for general non-tree network games, the existence result for tree games does not hold. Nevertheless, when collusion neutrality is weakened to pairwise neutrality, we show by examples that even for non-tree networks, there may exist solutions for network games satisfying pairwise neutrality, efficiency and null-player property.These results, except for the result with pairwise neutrality, show that tree networks are the only type of networks where we can obtain the existence result. Thus, to establish a uniqueness result, we assume a tree network. Interpreting a rooted tree as a hierarchy, the hierarchical solution (Demange, 2004) allows each coalition of a player and all her successors to get its worth as its total payoff. All hierarchical solutions satisfy collusion neutrality and efficiency. They also satisfy null-player property on the domain of tree-restricted games (van den Brink, 2012). Our second result shows that on a tree network, affine combinations (linear combinations the sum of which coefficients equals 1) of these hierarchical solutions are the only solutions satisfying the three axioms and linearity on the domain of tree-restricted games. Linearity is the combination of homogeneity (of degree 1) and additivity and is used in other characterization results by Shapley (1953), Lehrer (1988),33Lehrer (1988) considers a slightly weaker axiom, additivity.Haller (1994), van den Brink (2009), Mishra and Talman (2010), etc. The same characterization result also holds on the domain of all games, when null-player property is replaced with a weaker axiom called very-null-player property.All our characterization results on a tree network continue to hold when collusion neutrality is replaced with the combination of a weaker axiom, pairwise neutrality (pertaining to collusions of two players) and pairwise external neutrality (pairwise collusive agreement should not influence the payoffs of other players).44It is similar to pairwise non-bossiness in Ju (2013) and non-bossiness with regard to preferences introduced by Satterthwaite and Sonnenschein (1981).As corollaries, we obtain characterizations of the average tree solution (the average of hierarchical solutions, i.e., the affine combination with equal weights) by van den Brink (2009) and Mishra and Talman (2010).55An alternative characterization is provided by Béal, Rémila, and Solal (2010).A cooperative game with transferable utility, briefly a game is defined by the set of playersN≡{1,2,…,n}and the characteristic functionv:2N→Rwithv(∅)=0,which associates with each non-empty coalition S ⊆ N the total payoff v(S) that the coalition can produce. Since the set of players N is fixed, we denote a game simply by its characteristic function v. For example, for all non-empty coalitions T ⊆ N, T-unanimity game uTis defined as follows: for all S ⊆ N, if T ⊆ S,uT(S)=1; otherwise,uT(S)=0.LetVbe the collection of all these games. A payoff vectorx≡(xi)i∈N∈RNis an n-dimensional vector, where xiis the payoff of player i ∈ N. A solutionf:V→RNassociates with each game v a payoff vectorf(v)∈RN. For all S ⊆ N, we sometimes denote the sum of payoffs for players in S by xS≡ ∑i ∈ Sxiand fS(v) ≡ ∑i ∈ Sfi(v).The following three axioms for solutions are standard in the cooperative game literature. The first axiom requires that the value of the grand coalition should be allocated to players without leftovers.Efficiency. For allv∈V,∑i∈Nfi(v)=v(N).A null player i ∈ N of game v is a player who has no contribution to others, that is, for all S ⊆ N\{i},v(S∪{i})=v(S). Let null(v) be the set of null players in v. The next axiom requires that null players should not be rewarded.Null-player property. For allv∈V,if i ∈ N is a null player in v, thenfi(v)=0.The next axiom is linearity considered in several closely related works by Lehrer (1988), Haller (1994), van den Brink (2009), and Mishra and Talman (2010) (also by Shapley, 1953).Linearity. For allv,w∈V,allc∈R,and all i ∈ N,fi(v)+fi(w)=fi(v+w)andfi(cv)=cfi(v).Players can make a collusive agreement that binds the collusion members to act as a single player in such a way that the collusion performs its role in the original game if all its members are together; otherwise, the collusion plays no role, acting like the empty set. Formally, the collusive agreement of T ⊆ N turns the game v into vTsuch that for all S ⊆ N, if T¬⊆S,vT(S)=v(S∖T); if T ⊆ S,vT(S)=v(S). We look for solutions that are “neutral” to such collusive agreements so that no collusion can increase or decrease its total payoff. The strongest formulation of such a neutrality axiom is without any restriction on the formation of a collusion.Strong collusion neutrality. For allv∈Vand all subsets T ⊆ N,∑i∈Tfi(vT)=∑i∈Tfi(v).Strong pairwise neutrality is defined as above focusing on two-player collusions.66Strong collusion neutrality and strong pairwise neutrality are often called in the literature as collusion neutrality and pairwise neutrality, respectively. We add “strong” to distinguish them from our main axioms that are weaker due to a restriction on the formation of collusions. Malawski (2002) calls strong pairwise neutrality as neutrality of distrust operators.Unfortunately, van den Brink (2012, Theorem 2.1) shows that there is no solution satisfying strong (pairwise) collusion neutrality together with efficiency and null-player property. Strong collusion neutrality presumes that any subset of players can make a collusive agreement. When this presumption does not hold, it is reasonable to relax the axiom and require the neutrality condition only for feasible collusions. We consider the environment where collusive agreements are restricted by a fixed network (a non-directed graph) defined by the set of nodes N and the set of edges L ⊆ {{i, j}: i, j ∈ N with i ≠ j}. Since the set of nodes is given by the set of players N, we simply denote a network by the set of edges L. For i, j ∈ N with i ≠ j, a path from i to j is a sequence of nodes(i1,…,ik)such thati1=i,ik=j,{i1, i2} ∈ L,…,{ik−1,ik}∈L,and all i2,…,ikare distinct. Then, we say that eachh∈{i1,…,ik}is in the path from i to j. A subset S of N is connected on L if it is a singleton, or if, for all i, j ∈ S with i ≠ j, there is a path from i to j,(i1,…,ik)such that{i1,…,ik}⊆S. LetC(L)be the set of connected subsets of N on L. We say network L is connected when the set of all nodes N is connected on L.Throughout the paper, we assume a connected network L,77All our results can be extended to disconnected networks in a fairly straightforward manner.which puts a constraint on the formation of collusive agreements. Given network L, only connected sets of players can make a collusive agreement.Accordingly, we relax strong collusion neutrality focusing on these connected subsets.Collusion neutrality (on L). For allv∈Vand all connected subsets T ⊆ N on L,∑i∈Tfi(vT)=∑i∈Tfi(v).Pairwise neutrality (on L) is defined focusing on two-player collusions, namely edges of L.Despite this weakening of the neutrality axiom, the impossibility result of van den Brink (2012, Theorem 2.1) continues to hold except for the case when L is a “line”, as we show later. However, a weakening of null-player property allows us to turn this impossibility into a possibility. We drop the requirement of giving the zero payoff to some null players who can play a role in “connecting two non-null players” so that they can make a collusive agreement on L. All other null players should receive the zero payoff. A player i ∈ N is a very null player if she is a null player and is not in any path from a non-null player to another non-null player. For example, on the network L in Fig. 1, when all players except for 5 and 6 are null players for game v, the only path from 5 to 6 includes two null players 3 and 4. Therefore neither 3 nor 4 is a very null player. All other null players are very null players too.Very-null-player property (onL). For allv∈V,if i ∈ N is a very null player in v, thenfi(v)=0.We often skip referring to L and call the two properties simply by collusion neutrality and very-null-player property. Nevertheless it should be noted that the two properties are defined using the underlying network constraint L.As assumed earlier, the network L puts a restriction on the formation of collusive agreements and our collusion neutrality is defined under this restriction as an axiom for solutions on the domainVof all games in the previous section. In this section, we consider an alternative domain where the network L puts a restriction also on the formation of coalition in games so that only connected coalitions can form (Myerson, 1977).Given a network L, disconnected coalition T cannot form and so v(T) cannot be realized and the worth of the disconnected coalition T should be revised to the sum of the payoffs for its maximal connected subsets, or components on L. Using this, the network restriction L turns the game v into the network game restricted by L, briefly, the L-restricted game (v, L) such that for all S ⊆ N, if S is connected on L, the worth of S in (v, L) equals v(S); if S is disconnected, the worth of S in (v, L) equals ∑T ∈ P(S)v(T), where P(S) is the set of components of S on L. The characteristic function of (v, L) is denoted by vL. Hence for all S ⊆ N,vL(S)=∑T∈P(S)v(T). LetV(L)≡{(v,L):v∈V} be the collection of L-restricted games.Some of our results are obtained for solutions onV(L). The axioms for solutions onVin the previous section are modified in a fairly straightforward manner to formulate the same axioms for solutions onV(L),simply replacingVwithV(L)and replacing v, vT, or w with (v, L), (vT, L), or (w, L), etc.88For instance, a solution onV(L)is linear if for all(v,L),(w,L)∈V(L),allc∈R,and all i ∈ N,fi(v,L)+fi(w,L)=fi(v+w,L)andfi(cv,L)=cfi(v,L).In particular, the axiom of null-player property for L-restricted games concerns the null players of L-restricted games (v, L) (as in van den Brink, 2012, p. 347, Section 3), which differ from the null players of v.Null-player property (onV(L)). For all(v,L)∈V(L),if i ∈ N is a null player in (v, L), thenfi(v,L)=0.The differences among null players of v, null players of (v, L) and very null players of v are discussed next.Remark 1Letv∈V. (i) Note that a null player in v is not necessarily a null player in network game (v, L) and that a null player in network game (v, L) is not necessarily a null player in v either. (ii) Nevertheless, all very null players in v are null players both in v and in (v, L) but not vice versa. Therefore, very-null-player property is strictly weaker than null-player property on both domains,VandV(L).(i) LetN={1,2,3}. Consider a line L ≡ {{1, 2}, {2, 3}}. Letv({1,3})=v({1,2,3})=1andv(1)=v(2)=v(3)=v({1,2})=v({2,3})=0.ThenvL({1,3})=0,and for all other coalitions S ≠ {1, 3},vL(S)=v(S),in particular,vL({1,2,3})=1. Thennull(v)={2}andnull(v,L)=∅. Now consider another game w that differs from v only at coalition {2, 3}. Letw({2,3})=1and for all other S ≠ {2, 3},w(S)=v(S). ThenwL({1,3})=0and for all other coalitions S ≠ {1, 3},wL(S)=w(S). Note thatnull(w)=∅andnull(w,L)={1}.(ii) To prove that all very null players in v are null players in (v, L), let i be a very null player in v. Let S ⊆ N\{i}. If there is no j ∈ S that is adjacent to i (that is, {i, j} ⊆ L}, thenvL(S∪{i})=vL(S)+vL({i})=vL(S)+v({i})=vL(S),where the last equation holds since i is a null player in v. Now suppose that there is j ∈ S that is adjacent to i. LetT1,…,TMbe the components of S, which contain these nodes adjacent to i. Since i is a very null player of v, either none of these M components has any non-null player of v or one and only one, say T1, of them has a non-null player. Let T ≡ T1 ∪ ⋅⋅⋅ ∪ TM. Then in either case, deleting all null players in T\T1 one by one,v(T)=v(T1)andv(T∪{i})=v(T1∪{i})=v(T1),where the second equation holds since i is a null player of v. Therefore we get(1)vL(T∪{i})=v(T∪{i})=v(T1),where the first equation holds since T ∪ {i} is connected. Likewise, we can also show(2)vL(T)=v(T1)+⋯+v(TM)=v(T1).Note thatvL(S∪{i})=vL(S∖T)+vL(T∪{i})andvL(S)=vL(S∖T)+vL(T). Then using (1) and (2), we getvL(S∪{i})=vL(S). Since this holds for all S ⊆ N\{i}, i is a null player of (v, L).Now we show by example that the converse does not hold, that is, there can be a null player both in v and in (v, L), who is not a very null player in v.99This example was provided by a referee.Let N ≡ {1, 2, 3} and consider a line L ≡ {{1, 2}, {1, 3}}. Let v be such thatv(1)=0,v(2)=v(3)=1,v({1,2})=v({1,3})=1,andv({2,3})=v({1,2,3})=2. Note that vL( · ) coincides with v( · ) and player 1 is a null player both in v and in (v, L). However, this player is not very null because the set of non-null players is {2, 3}, which becomes connected only when player 1 is added.□When L is a tree, there are numerous solutions onV(L)(or onV) satisfying null-player property (very-null-player property, respectively) as well as efficiency and collusion neutrality as shown by van den Brink (2012).1010See Theorem 3.1 in van den Brink (2012) and his concluding remarks.These solutions are defined in the next section.Network L is a tree, if for all i, j ∈ N with i ≠ j, there is a unique path from i to j. In this section, we assume that L is a tree. We say a path(i1,i2,…,ik)contains h ∈ N if h is one of the nodes constituting the path (i.e.,h∈{i1,i2,…,ik}). Fix a node i ∈ N and lets¯i(j)≡{h∈N:the path from i to h contains j} be the set of successors of player j from the origin i. Letsi(j)≡{h∈s¯i(j):{h,j}∈L}be the set of immediate successors of player j.DefinitionHierarchical solutionsGiven a tree L, for all agents i ∈ N, i-hierarchical solutionhi(·)=(hji(·))j∈Nassociates with eachv∈Vthe payoff vector such that for all j ∈ N,hji(v)=v(s¯i(j)∪{j})−∑k∈si(j)v(s¯i(k)∪{k}).Although we do not explicitly denote tree L in our notation of hierarchical solution, it should be noted that the hierarchical solutions are defined using the fixed tree network L. On the domain of network gamesV(L),hierarchical solutions and their convex combinations satisfy null-player property as well as efficiency and collusion neutrality (van den Brink, 2012). However, onV,these solutions may violate null-player property but they still satisfy very-null-player property.The following facts are useful.Fact 1For all S, T ⊆ N, if S ∩ T ≠ ∅, thenuTS=uS∪T.The proof is immediate from the definition.□Let L be a tree. GivenT ⊆ N, let Tcn⊆ N be the union of all paths connecting two nodes in T. Then Tcnis the minimal connected set containing T (that is, for all connected sets S ⊆ N containing T, Tcn⊆ S) and both the set of very null players in uTand the set of null players in (uT, L) equal N∖Tcn.Since L is a tree, any two nodes in T have one and only one path connecting one to the other and therefore, every connected subset S containing T should contain Tcn. That is , Tcnis the minimal connected set containing T. Then the characteristic function of (uT, L) coincides withuTcn. Therefore, the set of null players in (uT, L) equals the set of null players inuTcn,N\Tcn. Thus we only have to show that i is a very null player in uTif and only if i ∈ N\Tcn. The only-if part is evident. To prove the converse, suppose that i is not a very null player in uT. Then either i is not a null player or i should be in a path connecting a non-null player j ∈ T and another non-null player k ∈ T. In the former case, i ∈ T and so i ∈ Tcn. In the latter case, the path connecting the two non-null players j and k is unique (and so in Tcn) for L is a tree. Therefore, we also have i ∈ Tcn.□We first investigate when the three axioms, collusion neutrality (on L), efficiency, and null-player property, are compatible. We do this for the domain of network gamesV(L)as well as for the domain of all gamesV. van den Brink (2012) shows that when L is the complete networkL={{i,j}:i,j∈Nwith i ≠ j}, the three axioms are not compatible on the domain of all gamesV(van den Brink, 2012, Theorem 2.1, p. 345), whereas when L is a tree, they are compatible on the domain of tree gamesV(L)(van den Brink, 2012, Theorem 3.1, p. 347). We further investigate whether his existence result holds for non-tree networks and also for the domain of all gamesV.Theorem 1Assume that a network L is given and only connected collusions on the network can form.(i)There is a solution onV(L)satisfying collusion neutrality, efficiency, and null-player property if and only if L is a tree.There is a solution onVsatisfying collusion neutrality, efficiency, and null-player property if and only if L is a line.When L is a tree, there is a solution onVsatisfying pairwise neutrality, efficiency, and null-player property if and only if L is a line.Part(i). When L is a tree, hierarchical solutions satisfy the three axioms as shown by van den Brink (2012). To prove the converse, suppose that L has a cycle, that is, for some r ≥ 3, {{1, 2}, {2, 3},…,{r−1,r},{r, 1}} ⊆ L. LetT≡{1,2,…,r}and x ≡ f(uT, L). For eachk∈{1,2,…,r−1},consideru{k,k+1}and collusions T\{k} andT∖{k+1}. By Fact 1 and collusion neutrality,fk(u{k,k+1},L)+∑i∈T∖{k,k+1}fi(u{k,k+1},L)=xk+∑i∈T∖{k,k+1}xi;fk+1(u{k,k+1},L)+∑i∈T∖{k,k+1}fi(u{k,k+1},L)=xk+1+∑i∈T∖{k,k+1}xi.By null-player property, for allk=1,…,r−1,(3)fk(u{k,k+1},L)=xk+∑i∈T∖{k,k+1}xi;(4)fk+1(u{k,k+1},L)=xk+1+∑i∈T∖{k,k+1}xi.Likewise, consider u{r, 1} and collusions T\{r} and T\{1}. Then by Fact 1, collusion neutralityand null-player property,(5)fr(u{r,1},L)=xr+∑i∈T∖{r,1}xi;(6)f1(u{r,1},L)=x1+∑i∈T∖{r,1}xi.Taking the sum of (3)–(6) over allk=1,…,r−1,we obtain∑k=1r−1[fk(u{k,k+1},L)+fk+1(u{k,k+1},L)]+fr(u{r,1},L)+f1(u{r,1},L)=2(r−1)∑i∈Txi.Using null-player property and efficiency, this impliesr=2(r−1). Hencer=2,which contradicts the initial assumption r ≥ 3.Part (ii). If L is a line, then for any end node i, i-hierarchical solution hi( · ) satisfies the three axioms. To show this, assume L ≡ {{1, 2}, {2, 3},…,{n−1,n}}. Then 1 is an end node and for allv∈Vand all i ∈ N,hi1(v)=v({i,i+1,…,n})−v({i+1,…,n}),which equals 0 when i is a null player. Hence 1-hierarchical solution satisfies null-player property. Other axioms can be shown easily.To prove the converse, first note that by part (i), L must be a tree. Now suppose that L is not a line. Then there are four distinct nodes i, j, k, l ∈ N such that {{i, j}, {i, k}, {i, l}} ⊆ L. We prove the non-existence result for the case with {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}} ⊆ L. We show that given this tree, there is no solution f satisfying the three axioms. Let M ≡ {1, 2, 3, 4} andf(uM)=α. Then by null-player property, for all k ≥ 5,αk=0. Then, by collusion neutrality and Fact 1, f1(u{2, 3, 4})+f2(u{2,3,4})=f1(uM)+f2(uM),f1(u{2,3,4})+f3(u{2,3,4})=f1(uM)+f3(uM),andf1(u{2,3,4})+f4(u{2,3,4})=f1(uM)+f4(uM). Taking the sum of the three equations and using efficiency and null-player property, we get1=1+2f1(uM). Henceα1=0.By collusion neutrality and Fact 1,f1(u{1,3,4})+f2(u{1,3,4})=f1(uM)+f2(uM)=α1+α2. Sinceα1=0,f1(u{1,3,4})=α2. On the other hand, by Fact 1,(u{3,4}){1,3}=u{1,3,4}=(u{3,4}){1,4}. Thus, since 1 is a null player in u{3, 4},f1(u{3,4})+f3(u{3,4})=f3(u{3,4})=f1(u{1,3,4})+f3(u{1,3,4})andf1(u{3,4})+f4(u{3,4})=f4(u{3,4})=f1(u{1,3,4})+f4(u{1,3,4}). Taking the sum of the two equations and using efficiency and null-player property, we get1=1+f1(u{1,3,4}),that is,f1(u{1,3,4})=0. Sincef1(u{1,3,4})=α2,α2=0. Similarly,α3=0andα4=0. Therefore,α1=α2=α3=α4=0,which contradicts efficiency.Part (iii). Note that the proof of part (ii) in the case of a tree network is based on only pairwise collusions. Thus the same proof can be used to prove part (iii).□When|N|=3,part (i) holds replacing collusion neutrality with pairwise neutrality. This is clear from the fact that when|N|=3,all collusions used in the proof are pairwise. When |N| ≥ 4, collusion neutrality in part (i) cannot be replaced with pairwise neutrality. We provide, in Example 1, some solutions for non-tree-network games satisfying pairwise neutrality, efficiency and null-player property. van den Brink (2012) studies pairwise neutrality in two models. The first is when the domain isVand L is the complete network and the second is when the domain isV(L)and L is a tree. In the former case, he obtains an impossibility result (Theorem 2.1 of van den Brink, 2012), which is implied by part (iii),1111van den Brink (2012) considers the case of complete network. Then pairwise neutrality on the complete network implies pairwise neutrality on L. Part (iii) implies that when L is a tree and not a line, there is no solution onVsatisfying pairwise neutrality on L and the other two axioms, which implies that there is no solution onVsatisfying pairwise neutrality on the complete network and the other two axioms.and in the latter case a possibility result (Theorem 3.1 of van den Brink, 2012), which coincides with the “if part” of (i). But he does not consider non-tree networks. And his investigation of pairwise neutrality (on L) on the domain of tree games does not apply on the domainV(that is, network L restricts only collusive agreements but not coalition formation for games). Theorem 1 gives answers to the question of the existence for three other possibilities of network restriction.Consider a circular graphL={{1,2},{2,3},…,{n−1,n}, {1, n}} with n ≥ 4. Then there exist solutions onV(L)satisfying pairwise neutrality (on L), efficiency, and null-player property. Considern=5for simplicity. Define a linear solution f as follows. Letf(uN,L)=(1/5,1/5,…,1/5). For all i ∈ N, at unanimity game (uN\{i}, L), the two players in N∖{i}, adjacent to player i, receive 2/5 and the other two players in N\{i} receive 1/10. For instance,f(u{1,2,3,4},L)=(25,110,110,25,0),f(u{1,2,4,5},L)=(110,25,0,25,110),etc. For all pairs of adjacent players i, j ∈ N, at unanimity game (uN\{i, j}, L), the two players in N\{i, j} adjacent to i and j, receive 1/2 and the other player in N\{i, j} receives 0. For instance,f(u{1,2,3},L)=(12,0,12,0,0). For all pairs of adjacent players i, j ∈ N,fi(u{i,j},L)=fj(u{i,j},L)=1/2and all others receive 0. For all i ∈ N,fi(u{i},L)=1and for all j ≠ i,fj(u{i},L)=0. Thus, the payoff vectors for all unanimity games of connected coalitions are now defined.1212It is not necessary to consider disconnected coalitions because we are working onV(L).The payoff vectors for other games are defined using the payoff vectors for the above unanimity games and linearity. It is easy to check that this solution satisfies the three axioms.1313This solution violates pairwise external neutrality, to be defined later.For instance, to check pairwise neutrality, consider u{1, 2, 4, 5} and the collusion {2, 3}, which turns u{1, 2, 4, 5} tou{2,3}{1,2,4,5}=uN. The total payoff for players 2 and 3 equals 2/5 before and after the collusion. Now consider u{1, 2, 3} and the collusion {3, 4}, which turns u{1, 2, 3} tou{3,4}{1,2,3}=u{1,2,3,4}. The total payoff for players 3 and 4 equals 1/2 before and after the collusion.By Theorem 1 (part (i)), it is necessary to focus on tree networks to find solutions satisfying the three axioms. In what follows, we will focus on the case when L is a tree network and investigate (pairwise) collusion neutrality on L.Parts (ii) and (iii) of Theorem 1 say that when L is not a line, there is no solution satisfying the three stated axioms. It is clear from the proofs that this non-existence result relies crucially on the decisions over the set of games whose characteristic functions would be changed by the network restriction. When the domain is restricted toV(L),all affine combinations of the hierarchical solutions satisfy the three axioms; in particular, all convex combinations do as noted by van den Brink (2012). It is also crucial for the non-existence to require zero payoff to all null players, especially those null players who are not very null players. If null-player property is replaced with very-null-player property, again all affine combinations of the hierarchical solutions satisfy collusion neutrality as well as efficiency and very-null-player property.1414By Remark 1, all very null players in v are null players in (v, L), which should receive zero payoff in hierarchical solutions, as shown by van den Brink (2012).We next characterize solutions satisfying these three axioms together with linearity.For each coalition S ⊆ N, let LS≡ {{i, j} ∈ L: i, j ∈ S}. When L is a tree, LSis called a cone if both S and N∖S are connected.1515Cones are subtrees. But the complement set N\S of a subtree S may not be connected and so there are subtrees that are not cones. Béal et al. (2010) define cones as components obtained by deleting a link of the tree, which is equivalent to our definition.In this case, we also call S a cone with a slight abuse of notation. LetS≡{S⊆N:LSis a cone} be the set of all cones. We first show that when a solution f satisfies collusion neutrality and very-null-player property, the total payoff for each cone can be uniquely determined through the payoffs for the grand coalition unanimity game, f(uN).Lemma 1Assume that L is a tree. Letα=(α1,…,αn)≡f(uN). If a solution f onVsatisfies collusion neutrality and very-null-player property, then for all T ⊆ N and all cones S, the total payoff for S at unanimity game uT is determined byfS(uT)={αN,ifS∈P1;0,ifS∈P2;αS,ifS∈P3∪P4,whereP1≡{S∈S:Tcn⊆S},P2≡{S∈S:Tcn⊆N∖S},P3≡{S∈S:S∉P1∪P2and S ⊆ Tcn}, andP4≡{S∈S:S∉P1∪P2and S¬⊆Tcn}. The same result holds forV(L)replacing very-null-player property with null-player property.Consider S ∈ P1. Then for all i ∈ N\S, i ∉ Tcnand so i is a very null player in the game uT. Hence by very-null-player property,fi(uT)=0for all i ∈ N\S. HencefS(uT)=fN(uT). By collusion neutrality,fN(uT)=fN(uNT). Therefore, usinguNT=uN,fS(uT)=fN(uN)=αN.Consider S ∈ P2. Then for all i ∈ S, i ∉ Tcn, and so i is a very null player in uT. Hence by very-null-player property,fS(uT)=0.For S ∈ P3 ∪ P4, we divide the proof into three cases.Case 1: S ∈ P3 and T is connected.Since in this case, T⊋S,uN∖ST=uN. This yields, by connectedness of N\S and collusion neutrality,fN∖S(uT)=fN∖S(uN). Again by collusion neutrality,fN(uT)=fN(uNT)=fN(uN).Therefore,fS(uT)=fN(uT)−fN∖S(uT)=fN(uN)−fN∖S(uN)=αS.Case 2: S ∈ P4 and T is connected.When S is a singleton, P4 is empty. By T ∩ S ≠ ∅, it holds thatuST=uT∪S,which, by collusion neutrality, yieldsfS(uT)=fS(uT∪S). Since T ∩ (N∖S) ≠ ∅, we have S⊊T ∪ S, which impliesfS(uT∪S)=αSby Case 1. Then it follows thatfS(uT)=fS(uT∪S)=αS.Case 3: S ∈ P3 ∪ P4 and T is disconnected.Since T ∩ S ≠ ∅,uST=uT∪S,then by connectedness of S and collusion neutrality,fS(uT)=fS(uT∪S). Since Tcn∪ S ∈ P3 and Tcn∪ S is connected, then by Case 1,fS(uTcn∪S)=αS. Thus we have only to showfS(uT∪S)=fS(uTcn∪S),which leads tofS(uT)=fS(uT∪S)=fS(uTcn∪S)=αS.Since(T∪S)∪(Tcn∖S)=Tcn∪Sand(T∪S)∩(Tcn∖S)=T∩(N∖S)≠∅,thenuTcn∖ST∪S=uTcn∪S. By connectedness of Tcn∖S and collusion neutrality,(7)fTcn∖S(uT∪S)=fTcn∖S(uTcn∪S).Since[T∪S]cn=Tcn∪S,then by very-null-player property,fTcn∪S(uT∪S)=fN(uT∪S)andfTcn∪S(uTcn∪S)=fN(uTcn∪S). By collusion neutrality,fN(uT∪S)=fN(uNT∪S)=fN(uN)=αN. Likewise,fN(uTcn∪S)=αN. Therefore,fTcn∪S(uT∪S)=fTcn∪S(uTcn∪S)=αN. Therefore, using (7),fTcn∪S(uT∪S)=fTcn∖S(uT∪S)+fS(uT∪S)andfTcn∪S(uTcn∪S)=fTcn∖S(uTcn∪S)+fS(uTcn∪S),we obtainfS(uT∪S)=fS(uTcn∪S).□When the solution f in the lemma also satisfies linearity, we can obtain the same uniqueness result for all games as follows: for all gamesv∈Vand all cones S ⊆ N, we havefS(v)=fN∖S(uN)v(S)+fS(uN)[v(N)−v(N∖S)].1616The proof of this statement is available upon request.This implies that the total share for a cone is represented by a weighted sum of the worth of the cone coalition and the worth this cone contributes to the complement coalition.Together with efficiency and linearity, we can now establish our main characterization.Theorem 2Assume that L is a tree. A solution onVsatisfies collusion neutrality, efficiency, very-null-player property, and linearity if and only if it is an affine combination of hierarchical solutions.Fixα=(α1,…,αn)≡f(uN). Let T ⊆ N. As in Lemma 1, we partition the set of all cones into P1 ≡ {S: Tcn⊆ S}, P2 ≡ {S: Tcn⊆ N\S}, P3 ≡ {S: S ∉ P1 ∪ P2 and S ⊆ Tcn}, and P4 ≡ {S: S ∉ P1 ∪ P2 and S¬⊆Tcn}. Now we show that for all T ⊆ N, f(uT) is determined by the linear combination of hierarchical outcomes, ∑t ∈ Nαtht(uT).If i ∉ Tcn, thenfi(uT)=0by very-null-player property. We also havehit(uT)=0for all t ∈ N because all hierarchical solutions satisfy very-null-player property. This leads to∑t∈Nαthit(uT)=0. Hencefi(uT)=∑t∈Nαthit(uT).Suppose i ∈ Tcn. Let v(i) be the number of components of N∖{i} which intersect with Tcn, and w(i) be the number of components of N∖{i} which are disjoint with Tcn. Let J1, J2,…,Jv(i) be the components of N\{i} which intersect with Tcn, and K1, K2,…,Kw(i) be the components of N∖{i} which are disjoint with Tcn. Note that all these components are cone coalitions. By Lemma 1,fJ1(uT)=αJ1,…,fJv(i)(uT)=αJv(i)because all theseJ1,…,Jv(i)are contained in P3 ∪ P4 (not in P1 due to the fact that i ∈ Tcn). Also, by Lemma 1,fK1(uT)=⋯=fKw(i)(uT)=0because all theseK1,…,Kw(i)are contained in P2. Thus, it follows that(8)fi(uT)=fN(uT)−fJ1(uT)−⋯−fJv(i)(uT)−fK1(uT)−⋯−fKw(i)(uT)=αN−αJ1−⋯−αJv(i),where the second equality holds because by collusion neutrality,fN(uT)=fN(uNT)=fN(uN)=αN.Note that for unanimity games, a hierarchical solution gives the entire payoff only to one player who takes the highest position among non-very-null players in the directed tree. For t ∈ J1∪⋅⋅⋅∪Jv(i), we havehit(uT)=0either because the root player t gets the entire payoff 1 or because player i is subordinate to some player j ∈ Tcnwho lies along the path between i and t. For t ∈ K1∪⋅⋅⋅∪Kw(i), we havehit(uT)=1because player i takes the highest position among those in Tcn. Fort=i,we havehii(uT)=1. Therefore, we have∑t∈Nαthit(uT)=αK1+⋯+αKw(i)+αi. Since it holds thatαi=αN−αJ1−⋯−αJv(i)−αK1−⋯−αKw(i),we get∑t∈Nαthit(uT)=αN−αJ1−⋯−αJv(i). Therefore, by (8),fi(uT)=∑t∈Nαthit(uT).Finally, this conclusion for unanimity games can easily be extended to all gamesv∈V. Note that v can be represented by a linear combination of unanimity games:v=∑T⊆NλT(v)uT. Then, by linearity, it follows thatf(v)=∑T⊆NλT(v)f(uT)=∑T⊆NλT(v)∑i∈Nαihi(uT)=∑i∈Nαi∑T⊆NλT(v)hi(uT)=∑i∈Nαihi(v).The third equality holds because all hierarchical solutions also satisfy linearity.Note that by efficiency,αN=fN(uN)=uN(N)=1. Therefore, the linear combination is indeed an affine combination.□All four axioms in the theorem are independent. (i) Shapley value violates collusion neutrality and satisfies the other three. (ii) The equal division of v(N) violates very-null-player property and satisfies the other three. (iii) To show the independence of linearity from the other three axioms, consider the following rule. Let C > 0 be a constant. For allv∈V,if v(N) ≥ C, f(v) coincides with the hierarchical outcome with root 1; otherwise, f(v) coincides with the hierarchical outcome with root 2. This rule is obviously not linear. It satisfies collusion neutrality because any collusive agreement cannot change v(N) and hierarchical solutions are neutral. Since hierarchical solutions satisfy efficiency and null-player property and f always coincides with a hierarchical solution at each game, f satisfies these two axioms too. (iv) Dropping efficiency from Theorem 2 allows us to characterize a bigger family of solutions obtained by a linear combination of hierarchical solutions. This can be seen from the observation that in our proof of this theorem, efficiency is used at the last to prove that the sum of the weights α1,…,αnused for the linear combination equals 1. The rest of the proof goes through without efficiency.On the domain of tree-restricted games, all hierarchical solutions and their convex combinations satisfy null-player property as shown by van den Brink (2012). In fact, all affine combinations also satisfy it and the same characterization result holds for tree-restricted games.Corollary 1Assume that L is a tree. A solution onV(L)satisfies collusion neutrality, efficiency, null-player property, and linearity if and only if it is an affine combination of hierarchical solutions.The proof is the same as in the proof of Theorem 2, only replacing very null player with null player and very-null-player property with null-player property and using the second part (pertaining toV(L)) of Lemma 1.□The average tree solution (Herings et al., 2008) is a special example of using equal weights, namely,f(v)=1n∑i∈Nhi(v). Herings et al. (2008) provide an axiomatization of the average tree solution. Our main result gives an alternative axiomatization. We only need to add the following minimal equal treatment property.Uniform treatment of uniforms.1717Ju, Miyagawa, and Sakai (2007).f1(uN)=f2(uN)=⋯=fn(uN).It follows from Corollary 1 that:Corollary 2Assume that L is a tree. A solution onV(L)satisfies collusion neutrality, efficiency, null-player property, linearity, and uniform treatment of uniforms if and only if it is the average tree solution.The same corollary can be obtained from Theorem 2 for the domainV.We now derive alternative characterization results using pairwise neutrality. Our results in this section are obtained from the main results and equivalence between collusion neutrality and the combination of pairwise neutrality and the following axiom of pairwise external neutrality, which says that if two linked players cannot change their total payoff through their collusion, the payoffs of the other players should not be changed either.1818Ju (2013) considers a similar axiom, called “non-bossiness” in the framework of allocation problems.Pairwise external neutrality(onL). For all edges {i, j} ∈ L, iffi(v{i,j})+fj(v{i,j})=fi(v)+fj(v),then for all h ∈ N\{i, j},fh(v{i,j})=fh(v).1919A stronger property, strong pairwise external neutrality can be defined without the premisefi(v{i,j})+fj(v{i,j})=fi(v)+fj(v). Pairwise external neutrality and pairwise neutrality together imply strong pairwise external neutrality, and the converse also holds for efficient solutions. Thus these two axioms can be replaced with strong pairwise external neutrality in the main results of this section.Hierarchical solutions satisfy pairwise external neutrality. To see this, for any link i, j with i closer to the root than j, the total payoff of any other player h ≠ i, j depends only on the worth of the coalition of h and all successors of h and the worths of coalitions of each immediate successor of h and her successors. Since these coalitions either include both i and j or include none of i and j, then the coalitional worths are not affected by the collusion of i and j. Hence h’s payoff is not affected either.Lemma 2Pairwise neutrality, pairwise external neutrality, and linearity together imply collusion neutrality.Let f be a solution onVsatisfying pairwise neutrality, pairwise external neutrality, and linearity.First, we show that for all unanimity games uTand all connected S ⊆ N,(9)fS(uST)=fS(uT).Case 1.T∩S=∅or S ⊆ T. In this case,uST=uT(using Fact 1 when S ⊆ T) and so (9) holds trivially.Case 2. T ∩ S ≠ ∅ and S∖T ≠ ∅. Since S is connected, there is j1 ∈ S\T that is adjacent to a node h1 ∈ T ∩ S ≠ ∅. Let J1 ≡ {j1} and S1 ≡ [T ∩ S] ∪ J1. Next, if S ≠ S1, there is j2 ∈ S\S1 that is adjacent to a node h2 ∈ S1. Let J2 ≡ {j1, j2} and S2 ≡ [T ∩ S] ∪ J2. Continuing this way, elements in S\T can be ordered asj1,j2,…,jMfor some M such that for someh1,h2,…,hM∈S,we have: for allm=0,1,…,M,hm∈Sm−1and hmjm∈ L, whereJ0=∅and S0 ≡ T ∩ S.For allm=1,…,M,by pairwise neutrality,fhmjm(uT∪Jm−1)=fhmjm(uT∪Jm). Then by pairwise external neutrality,fk(uT∪Jm−1)=fk(uT∪Jm),for all k ∈ S\{hm, jm}. Hence, for allm=1,…,M,fS(uT∪Jm−1)=fS(uT∪Jm),which impliesfS(uT)=fS(uT∪J1)=⋯=fS(uT∪JM)=fS(uT∪S). Note that since T ∩ S ≠ ∅,fS(uT∪S)=fS(uST). Therefore we getfS(uST)=fS(uT).To show thatfS(v)=fS(vS)for allv∈Vand allS∈C(L),we use linearity and the fact that all games can be represented by a linear combination of unanimity games.□It follows from Lemma 2 and Theorem 2 that:Theorem 3Assume that L is a tree. The following are equivalent.(i)Solution f onVsatisfies pairwise neutrality, pairwise external neutrality, efficiency, very-null-player property, and linearity.Solution f onVsatisfies collusion neutrality, efficiency, very-null-player property, and linearity.Solution f onVis an affine combination of hierarchical solutions.By Lemma 2, (i) implies (ii). Theorem 2 shows the equivalence between (ii) and (iii). Finally, as we have explained earlier, all hierarchical solutions and their affine combinations satisfy the axioms in (i).□Pairwise external neutrality plays a crucial role here. The next example shows that part (i) without pairwise external neutrality does not imply part (ii) in the theorem.Example 2LetN={1,2,3,4}andL={{1,2},{2,3},{3,4}}. For all T ⊆ N, the unanimity game for T is denoted by uT. Define solution f on the set of some of these unanimity games as follows:f(uN)=(14,14,14,14)=f(u{1,4})=f(u{1,2,4})=f(u{1,3,4}),f(u{1,2,3})=f(u{2,3,4})=(0,12,12,0)=f(u{1,3})=f(u{2,4}),f(u{2,3})=(0,12,12,0),f(u{1,2})=(0,1,0,0),f(u{3,4})=(0,0,1,0).Note thatu{3,4}{1,2,3}=uN,u{2,3}{1,2}=u{1,2,3},andu{1,2}{2,3}=u{1,2,3}. For allv∈V,whenv=∑T⊆NλT(v)uTfor some(λT(v)∈R)T⊆N,f(v) ≡ ∑T⊆NλT(v)f(uT). Then it is easy to check that this solution satisfies pairwise neutrality, as well as efficiency, very-null-player property, and linearity. However, collusion of {2, 3, 4} at u{1, 3} reduces the total payoff fromf2(u{1,3})+f3(u{1,3})+f4(u{1,3})=1tof2(u{2,3,4}{1,3})+f3(u{2,3,4}{1,3})+f4(u{2,3,4}{1,3})=f2(uN)+f3(uN)+f4(uN)=3/4. Hence the solution violates collusion neutrality. Since collusive agreement between 1 and 2 can affect the payoffs for 3 and 4 without affecting the total payoff of 1 and 2 (see the payoffs for u{2, 4} and the payoffs for u{1, 2, 4}; the total payoff of 1 and 2 are 1/2 in both games but the payoffs for 3 and 4 are different in the two games), f violates pairwise external neutrality.Assume that L is a tree. The following are equivalent.(i)Solution f onV(L)satisfies pairwise neutrality, pairwise external neutrality, efficiency, null-player property, and linearity.Solution f onV(L)satisfies collusion neutrality, efficiency, null-player property, and linearity.Solution f onV(L)is an affine combination of hierarchical solutions.On the domain of tree-restricted games, Mishra and Talman (2010) introduce the following axiom as the key axiom characterizing the average tree solution.Independence in unanimity games, briefly IUG. For all T ⊆ N and all j ∈ N∖T, if T and T ∪ {j} are connected, then for all i ∈ T with {i, j} ∉ L,fi(uT)=fi(uT∪{j}).In the next lemma, we show that IUG together with the other axioms in Theorem 2 imply pairwise neutrality and pairwise external neutrality. Thus, by Lemma 2, IUG also implies collusion neutrality.Lemma 3Let f be a solution onV(L)satisfying efficiency, null-player property, and linearity. Then, if f satisfies IUG, then it satisfies pairwise neutrality and pairwise external neutrality.Let f be a solution onV(L)satisfying IUG as well as efficiency, null player property, and linearity. First, we show that for all connected T ⊆ N, all {i, j} ∈ L, and all k ∈ N∖{i, j},f{i,j}(uT,L)=f{i,j}(u{i,j}T,L)andfk(uT,L)=fk(u{i,j}T,L). IfT∩{i,j}=∅orT∩{i,j}={i,j},thenu{i,j}T=uTand all of equalities trivially hold. Next considerT∩{i,j}={i}or {j}. Suppose without loss of generality,T∩{i,j}={i}. Sinceu{i,j}T=uT∪{j},IUG impliesfk(uT,L)=fk(uT∪{j},L),for all k ∈ T∖{i}. Combining efficiency and null-player property leads tof{i,j}(uT,L)=f{i,j}(uT∪{j},L)=f{i,j}(u{i,j}T,L). Also,fk(uT,L)=fk(uT∪{j},L)holds for all k ∈ N∖{i, j} by IUG and null-player property. Finally, to show thatf{i,j}(v,L)=f{i,j}(v{i,j},L)andfk(v{i,j},L)=fk(v,L)for allv∈V,all {i, j} ∈ L, and all k ∈ N∖{i, j}, we use linearity and the fact that the characteristic function of each tree-restricted game can be represented by a linear combination of unanimity games for connected coalitions.□Using this lemma, we can replace pairwise neutrality and pairwise external neutrality in part (i) of Corollary 3 with IUG and characterize affine combinations of hierarchical solutions. When uniform treatment of uniforms is added, the characterization of the average tree solution by Mishra and Talman (2010) is also obtained as a corollary.Corollary 4Assume that L is a tree. A solution onV(L)satisfies IUG (or pairwise neutrality and pairwise external neutrality), efficiency, null-player property, linearity, and uniform treatment of uniforms if and only if it is the average tree solution.This follows from Corollaries 1, 2, and Theorem 3.□van den Brink (2009) establishes a related result to this corollary (with pairwise neutrality and pairwise external neutrality) imposing an axiom which is similar to the combination of pairwise external neutrality anduniform treatment of uniforms.We have assumed a network L and considered either the case that L puts a constraint on the formation of collusive agreements and no constraint on coalition formation in games (so the domain isV) or the case that L puts a constraint both on the collusive agreements and on the coalition formation (so the domain isV(L)). In both cases, we have provided necessary and sufficient conditions on the network L for the existence of solutions satisfying the three main axioms (Theorem 1). In principle, the constraint for collusive agreements and the constraint for coalition formation may be determined by two different networks L and L′, and our investigation has focused on either the case L′ equals to the complete network (so no constraint) or the caseL′=L(network games inV(L)). We leave it for future research to investigate conditions for L and L′ for the existence with regard to these general cases of L and L′ where L′ ≠ L and L′ differs from the complete network.We have characterized the family of affine combinations of hierarchical solutions (Theorem 2). To characterize the subfamily consisting of convex combinations of hierarchical solutions, adding the following minimal equity condition will suffice. In N-unanimity game uN, all players take uniform roles. Therefore there is no basis of punishing some while rewarding the others.Minimal equity. There is no pair i, j ∈ N such that fi(uN) < 0 ≤ fj(uN).Efficiencyand minimal equitytogether imply that for all i ∈ N, fi(uN) ≥ 0 and so all coefficients used in an affine combination of hierarchical solutions in Theorem 2 should be non-negative. Thus adding minimal equity to the four axioms in Theorem 2 and Corollary 1, we can characterize the family of convex combinations (affine combinations with positive coefficients) of hierarchical solutions.Collusion neutrality on the domain of network gamesV(L)is defined here as well as in van den Brink (2012) in such a way that the network constraint L restricts collusive agreement first and then restricts the coalition formation of the game. Thus when a feasible collusion S forms, it changes network game (v, L) into (vS, L), of which the characteristic function is (vS)L. If the order of applying the network constraint L is reversed, the network game resulting from the collusion S has the characteristic function (vL)S, which is not necessarily the same as (vS)L. To explain why, consider a disconnected coalition T with two components T1 and T2. Assume that S¬⊆T.2020When S ⊆ T,(vS)L(T)=(vL)S(T). To show this, note that since S is connected (recall S is a feasible collusion), either S ⊆ T1 or S ⊆ T2. In the former case,(vS)L(T)=vS(T1)+vS(T2)=v(T1)+v(T2),where the second equation holds byS∩T2=∅. Note that(vL)S(T)=vL(T)=v(T1)+v(T2). Hence(vS)L(T)=(vL)S(T).Then neither S¬⊆T1 nor S¬⊆T2. Note thatT∖S=(T1∖S)∪(T2∖S)and that T1\S or T2\S may be disconnected, in which casev(T1∖S)+v(T2∖S)may differ fromvL(T1∖S)+vL(T2∖S). Therefore,(vS)L(T)=vS(T1)+vS(T2)=v(T1∖S)+v(T2∖S)is not necessarily the same as(vL)S(T)=vL(T∖S)=vL(T1∖S)+vL(T2∖S).Applying the network constraint to the coalition formation first and to the collusive agreement next, one can define an alternative notion of collusion neutrality. Our results on the domain of network gamesV(L),however, are robust with regard to this alternation of our neutrality.2121When the alternative notion of neutrality is considered, we need to use, in the proof of Corollary 1, the fact that the characteristic function of each network game is represented by a linear combination of characteristic functions of M-unanimity games with connected M. This is implied by Theorem 2.1 in Slikker and Nouweland (2001, p. 23). Except for this, the rest of the proofs will remain the same.To see this, note that in the proofs of both Theorem 1 (part (i)) and Corollary 1, our proofs apply collusion neutrality to unanimity games with regard to connected subsets of N and for these unanimity games, the above alternation of the definition of collusion neutrality does not make any difference. That is, for all connected M ⊆ N, the order of applying the network constraint for the M-unanimity game does not change the final characteristic function. To show this, assume that M is connected. Note that the characteristic function for network game (uM, L) is the same as uM. Consider feasible collusion S. There are two cases, M ∩ S ≠ ∅ orM∩S=∅. When M ∩ S ≠ ∅, by Fact 1,(uM)S=uM∪Sand since M ∪ S is connected,((uM)S,L)=(uM∪S,L)has the characteristic function of(uM)S=uM∪S. Now reversing the order of applying network constraint, the characteristic function of (uM, L) equals uMwhich turns, after collusion S, touSM=uM∪S. Now consider the caseM∩S=∅. Then the collusion S does not change the game and(uM)S=uM. Therefore, the characteristic function of ((uM)S, L) equals the characteristic function of (uM, L), which equals uM. And uMis the characteristic function when the collusion S forms in network game (uM, L).
