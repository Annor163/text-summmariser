@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A circle arc is a basic object in CAGD and in many applications. Conics are the oldest curves, and are used in architecture, robotics, and in many other fields. The unit circle has a nice parameterizationc(t)=(cos⁡t,sin⁡t),t∈[0,2π).In CAGD, parametric polynomial and rational curves and splines are fundamental objects. A circle arc does not have a parametric polynomial representation, however, it can be represented by using a quadratic rational Bézier curve. The whole circle can thus be represented by a quadratic rational spline, e.g. as a NURBS. A natural question is, whether it is possible to obtain a good parametric polynomial approximation of a circular arc.A lot of papers study good approximation of circular segments with the radial error as the parametric distance. Quadratic Bézier approximants are considered in Mørken (1991), and their generalizations to the cubic case can be found in Dokken et al. (1990) and Goldapp (1991). The quartic case is systematically studied in Ahn and Kim (1997), Kim and Ahn (2007) and Hur and Kim (2011), and quintic Bézier approximants are derived in Fang (1998, 1999). Recently, quarticG1approximants were analyzed in Kovač and Žagar (2014).General results on Hermite type approximation of conic sections by parametric polynomial curves of odd degree are given in Floater (1995, 1997). The results hold true only asymptotically, i.e., for small segments of a particular conic section. Hermite approximation of ellipse segments by cubic parametric Bézier curves is studied in Dokken (2003) and also in Dokken (1997).In recent years some quite surprisingly good approximations of the whole circle were obtained. An approach based on Taylor approximation was improved by idea of geometric interpolation and a construction of polynomial approximants for all odd degrees was obtained in Lyche and Mørken (1994). The construction that covered also even degrees was presented in Jaklič et al. (2007a). By looking at the problem from a different perspective, it turned out that the obtained construction was just one of several solutions of a nonlinear problem, and that there exist better solutions. In Jaklič et al. (2013), the best such solution was presented, which gives a good approximation of a conic section. It has many nice properties, it is symmetric, shape preserving, it gives a high order approximation of the whole circlec, and for higher degrees it circles the circle several times before it deviates fromc. Furthermore, it is given in a closed form.In this paper, a novel parametric polynomial approximant for the whole circle is presented, that gives a better approximation. It has many desired properties, such as symmetry and high order approximation. Another approach is presented that yields even (slightly) better results. Since solving of nonlinear equations and systems are involved, unfortunately the solutions could not be given exactly.As a motivation, consider Fig. 1. Here a parametric quintic polynomial approximant of the unit circle, given in Lyche and Mørken (1994), Jaklič et al. (2007a) as(1−2t2+2t42t−2t3+t5)is shown together with the quintic approximant from Jaklič et al. (2013) (with radial error 0.08999)(1−(3+5)t2+(1+5)t4(1+5)t−(3+5)t3+t5),and the quintic Taylor approximant, together with the new quintic approximant(0.99947004−3.87624490t2+1.87807588t42.79286220t−3.43427162t3+0.69240320t5),which is visually indistinguishable from the unit circle (the radial error is 0.00052). Note that also the new quartic approximant gives a better result than the quintic approximant from Jaklič et al. (2013) with radial error 0.0109 (see Fig. 2).Our goal is to construct parametric polynomialsxnandynof degree ≤n, which yield a good approximation of the whole unit circlecos2⁡(t)+sin2⁡(t)=1.Let us consider the expression(1)xn2(t)+yn2(t)=1+ϵ(t).Here, ϵ is a polynomial of degree≤2n. Since the circle does not have a parametric polynomial parameterization, every polynomial approximation(xn,yn)yields a deviation ϵ from the unit circle with the implicit equationx2+y2=1.So, in some sense, ϵ should be small to obtain a good approximation. Let us be more precise. We will consider the radial errore(t):=xn2(t)+yn2(t)−1on some interval[−t⁎,t⁎]. There are several problems:•the choice of ϵ,how to obtainxnandynfrom the equation (1),how to compute an appropriatet⁎.There are some more natural choices. An idea right at hand would be to takexnandynas Taylor expansion of cos and sin up to the degree n. This yields a good local approximation near 0, but the approximation quickly deviates from the circle (see Fig. 2 and Jaklič et al., 2007b).A quite similar expression to (1) is connected to Pell's equationTn2(t)−(t2−1)Un−12(t)=1,whereTnandUnare Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind. ThusTn2(t)+Un−12(t)=1+t2Un−12(t).Unfortunately this solution does not give a good approximation of the circle (see Fig. 3).One of promising ways is to use the equation of an ellipse in the polar formr(t,a)=11+acos⁡tand takeϵ(t)as Taylor expansion ofr(t,a)−1up to degree 2n. The results of such a choice are good, but another choice will give even better results.In this paper, we will tackle the caseϵ(t)=aT2n(t), where0<a<1is an unknown parameter. Best solutions forn≤9are obtained. They can be given in a closed form, but computation of the optimal parameter a requires solving a nonlinear equation. It will be shown, that the solutions can be improved. A way how to choose an optimal polynomial ϵ will be shown, and thus slightly better approximations for small n will be presented.Firstly, let us recall the main idea for solving the equation (1) in Jaklič et al. (2013). Solving the equation (1) is equivalent to solvingxn2(t)+yn2(t)=1in the factorial ringR[t]/ϵ(t). But since there are additional restrictions on degrees, the problem cannot be tackled by classical algebraic tools.But the special form of the equation enables an approach that straightforwardly yields all the solutions.The equationxn2(t)+yn2(t)=1+t2ncan be rewritten as(2)(xn(t)+iyn(t))(xn(t)−iyn(t))=∏k=02n−1(t−ei2k+12nπ),eiφ:=cos⁡φ+isin⁡φ,where the right-hand side is the factorization of1+t2noverC. From the uniqueness of the polynomial factorization overCup to a constant factor, and from the fact that the factors in (2) appear in conjugate pairs, it follows thatxn(t)+iyn(t)=γ∏k=0n−1(t−eiσk2k+12nπ),γ∈C,|γ|=1,whereσk=±1. In order to interpolate the point(1,0), γ must be chosen asγ:=(−1)n∏k=0n−1e−iσk2k+12nπ,which impliesxn(t)+iyn(t)=(−1)n∏k=0n−1(te−iσk2k+12nπ−1)=:pe(t;σ),withσ=(σk)k=0n−1∈{−1,1}n.The best solution is (see Jaklič et al., 2013, Thm. 1)xn(t)=Re(pe(t;σ⁎)),yn(t)=Im(pe(t;σ⁎)),σ⁎=(1)k=0n−1.The polynomialxnis an even function andynis an odd one. Their coefficients can be given in a closed form and possess a particular symmetry (see Jaklič et al., 2013). It was shown in Jaklič et al. (2013) that the radial error decreases exponentially with n.Our goal is to consider the equationxn2(t)+yn2(t)=1+aT2n(t),whereTnis the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind. A motivation for such a choice is straightforward. Among polynomials of degree 2n with leading coefficient 1, the polynomial122n−1T2n(t)has minimal infinity norm122n−1on the interval[−1,1], and it is reached exactly2n+1times at pointscos⁡kπn,k=0,1,…,2n. This gives 2n points (zeros ofT2n), where a parametric polynomial approximation(xn,yn)would intersect the unit circle.Solving the equation1+aT2n(t)=0is equivalent to finding values of the Chebyshev polynomialT2n(t)=−1a<−1.Thuscosh⁡(2narcCosh(−t))=−1a.SincearcCoshz=log⁡(z+z+1z−1)+2kπi,2narcCosh(−t)=log⁡(−1a+−1a+1−1a−1)+2kπi.Hence(3)sol(k):=t=−cosh⁡(12nlog⁡(−1a+1a2−1)+kπin),k=0,…,2n−1.Following the approach from (2),1+aT2n(t)=a22n−1∏k=02n−1(t−sol(k)),wheresol(k)are roots of the polynomial1+aT2n(t), obtained in (3).Recallzz‾=(xn+iyn)(xn−iyn)=xn2+yn2.From the uniqueness of the polynomial factorization overCup to a constant factor, and from the fact that the factors appear in conjugate pairs, it follows that each such choice of subsets of{0,1,…,2n−1}of size n, yields a solution of the problem, i.e., a parametric polynomial approximant of the unit circle. Thus(2nn)solutions are obtained. The choicep(t)=ina22n−1∏k=0n−1(t−sol(k)),xn(t)=Re(p(t)),yn(t)=Im(p(t)),yields the best approximation of the unit circle for a given parameter a.The radial error is(4)e(t)=xn2(t)+yn2(t)−1=1+aT2n(t)−1.We would like to obtain good approximant of the whole circle, thus we need to consider the following:•the error will be small for smalla>0,the largest error will be obtained at extrema of Chebyshev polynomials and at boundary valuest=0andt⁎, whereyn(t⁎)=0,we would like the solution to resemble the circle, be symmetric, and give the best possible approximation of such kind.Derivation of the radial error (4) yieldse′(t)=anU2n−1(t)1+aT2n(t),thus extremal values are obtained attk=cos⁡kπ2n,k=1,2,…,2n−1and(5)e(tk)=1+(−1)ka−1,sinceU2n−1(tk)=0. Clearly they are of alternating signs and1−a−1is greater by absolute value than the alternative.We are interested in the solution on the interval[−t⁎,t⁎], wheret⁎>0is the smallest value, such thatyn(t⁎)=0. Hencee(t⁎)=|xn(t⁎)|−1.Note thate(0)=1+aT2n(0)−1=1+(−1)na−1is equal to one of the extremal values (5). Thus we need to minimize the expression|1+aT2n(t⁎)−1|,wheret⁎depends on a. Since also the boundary value needs to be considered, one has to find the smallest positive solution of the equation|1+aT2n(t⁎)−1|=1−1−a.This yields the final equation(6)||xn(t⁎)|−1|=1−1−a.In Fig. 4, the functions on the left- and right-hand side of (6) are shown forn=4. The smallest positive intersection yields the parameter a for the best polynomial approximant. This requires solving a nonlinear equation, and high precision arithmetic is needed for larger n.In the presented approach, we exploited nice approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials. However, here the radial error does not reach the same absolute value at extremal points (so-called equioscillation). A better approximation can be obtained by using geometric interpolation in the following way.Since a symmetric solution is sought, let us takep(t)=(t2−t12)(t2−t22)⋯(t2−tn2),wheret1,t2,…,tnare unknown nonnegative numbers. Now let us consider the error functione(t,a)=1+ap(t)−1.Its derivativee′(t,a)=ap′(t)21+ap(t)has2n−1zerosti, one of them is 0. The extremal values of the error function, obtained atti, should oscillate in sign and have the same absolute valueM1. This yields a system of nonlinear equations for given a andtn. Each such choice yields the appropriate values oft1,t2,…,tn−1as the solution of the nonlinear system. By using the method, introduced in Section 3, we obtain the best parametric polynomial approximant(xn(t),yn(t))among many possible. The first positive zerot⁎ofyndetermines the valueM2=||xn(t⁎)|−1|. By consideringmintn,a⁡max⁡{M1,M2},we can obtain the best possible Chebyshev-like solution.This approach requires solving a system of nonlinear equations, solving a nonlinear equation, and bivariate minimization. Best approximants for small n will be given in the next section.A natural question is whether the radial error is the best choice. Since there is not an equivalent theory of polynomials of best approximation in the parametric setting as far as I know, some other measure of error could perhaps yield better results.First, let us consider the casen=3. Fora=1/5, the solution simplifies tox3(t)=25(8t2sinh⁡(16log⁡(5−26))−sinh⁡(12log⁡(5−26))),y3(t)=25t(−4t2−1+4cosh⁡(13log⁡(5−26))).The parameter valuea=0.2392102070552632gives the best solutionx3(t)=0.872233−1.98524t2,y3(t)=2.78729t−2.76672t3,with radial error 0.127767. It is shown in Fig. 5. Its radial error is presented in Fig. 6.Note that an approximation with uniformly oscillating errorx32+y32−1can be obtained ata=0.3253559144748783. Here, the radial error is larger, 0.151241.In Table 1, a comparison of parametric polynomial approximations of the unit circle is presented.In Fig. 7, approximant forn=4andn=5are shown, and in Fig. 8, their curvature profiles are presented. The latter approximant is indistinguishable from the circle.The parametric polynomial approximant circles around the unit circle several times, before deviating from it for larger degree n, see Fig. 9. Such a behavior was observed also for approximants in Jaklič et al. (2013).The best parametric polynomial approximants of the circle of low degree are presented in Table 2.Now let us consider uniform approximation. Solutions forn=3,4,…,8are given in Table 3, together with radial error. Parameter values for the best solution of the previous approach give good initial values for numerical computations that need to be done. In particular, we used the choicetn=1anda=a′⋅22n−1, wherea′is the value of a from Table 1. It turns out that the best solution is not unique, there are infinitely many of them.Forn=3andn=4the solutions are shown in Fig. 10. In Fig. 11, radial error for the approximant forn=8is shown. Note that for larger n, this approach yields solutions with error just slightly smaller that in the previously presented approach. Thus the previous approach could be used for theoretical study of error decay.The results improve approximations of the unit sphere in Jaklič et al. (2012) (see Fig. 12, where quintic approximants are used for construction of parametric polynomial approximation of the unit sphere, and yield the radial error 0.000529953).
