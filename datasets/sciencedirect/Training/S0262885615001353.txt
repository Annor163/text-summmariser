@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Automatic face alignment is a fundamental step in facial image analysis. However, this problem continues to be challenging due to the large variability of expression, illumination, occlusion, pose, and detection drift in the real-world face images. In this paper, we present a multi-view, multi-scale and multi-component cascade shape regression (M3CSR) model for robust face alignment. Firstly, face view is estimated according to the deformable facial parts for learning view specified CSR, which can decrease the shape variance, alleviate the drift of face detection and accelerate shape convergence. Secondly, multi-scale HoG features are used as the shape-index features to incorporate local structure information implicitly, and a multi-scale optimization strategy is adopted to avoid trapping in local optimum. Finally, a component-based shape refinement process is developed to further improve the performance of face alignment. Extensive experiments on the IBUG dataset and the 300-W challenge dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Automatic facial landmark localization plays an important role in facial image analysis [1–4]. A lot of methods [5–10] have been proposed, achieving remarkable improvements [11,12] on standard benchmarks in the past two decades. Existing methods can be roughly divided into three categories: generative methods, discriminative methods and statistical methods [13]. Generative methods attempt to optimize the shape parameter configuration by maximizing the probability of a face image being reconstructed by a facial deformable model. Active Shape Model (ASM) [14] and Active Appearance Model (AAM) [15–18] are two representative generative methods. Discriminative methods try to infer a face shape through a discriminative regression function, which directly maps a face image to the landmark coordinates [19–24]. There are two popular ways to learn such a regression function. One is based on deep neural network learning [25–28], the other is the well-known cascade shape regression model, which aims to learn a set of regressors to approximate complex nonlinear mapping between the initial shape and the ground truth [29–31]. The idea of Statistical methods is to combine both generative and discriminative methods, trying to fit the shape model on a statistical way after learning patch experts. The most notable example is probably the Constrained Local Model (CLM) [32–34] paradigm, which represents the face via a set of local image patches cropped around the landmark points. Recent research efforts have been made on the collection, annotation and alignment of face images captured in-the-wild [12]. However, face alignment is still challenging due to the large variability of expression, illumination, occlusion and pose in the real-world face images [11].An automatic face alignment system also suffers from the performance of face detector, because its initialization is usually based on the output of face detector. Challenging factors such as pose, illumination, expression and occlusion also have great effects on the performance of face detection [35]. Moreover, face detection is often determined by the criterion [36] that the ratio of the intersection of a detected region with an annotated face region is greater than 0.5. As shown in Fig. 1, all of the faces are detected according to the criterion of 0.5 overlap, but there is more or less drift with the detection results. When the detection result is largely drifted from the ground truth, it is actually not accurate enough for the initialization of face landmark localization algorithm.In this paper, we propose a robust face landmark localization algorithm. The proposed method is based on the popular cascade shape regression model, and we try to further improve its robustness from three aspects. Firstly, we develop a robust deformable parts model (DPM) [37,35] based face detector to provide a good shape initialization for face alignment. We also utilize the deformable parts information to predict the face view, so as to select the view-specific shape model. View based shape model is not only able to decrease the shape variance, but also can accelerate the shape convergence. Secondly, we develop a multi-scale cascade shape regression with multi-scale HOG features [38]. Multi-scale HOG features can incorporate local structure information implicitly, and multi-scale cascade shape regression helps to avoid trapping in local optimum. To further improve the performance of face alignment, a refinement process is conducted on facial components, such as mouth. The proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging benchmarks including the IBUG dataset and the 300-W dataset.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The related work is reviewed in Section 2. Cascade shape regression model with multi-view, multi-scale, and multi-component are presented in Section 3. Experimental results are shown in Section 4, and finally the conclusion is drawn in Section 5.
