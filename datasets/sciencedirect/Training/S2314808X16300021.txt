Biochemical profile of phytoplankton and its nutritional aspects in some khors of Lake Nasser, Egypt

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The quantitative and qualitative phytoplankton biochemical contents were carried out seasonally at the selected Khors.Cyanophyceae was the most dominant group at the studied khors.Protein represents the main biochemical content, which reflects a healthy phytoplankton with high relative growth rates.Winter was the optimum season for the measured biochemical contents; concurrently with high nitrate value.High significant variation (p ≤ 0.05) was found between the four khors according to the studied phytoplankton biochemical parameters during winter.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Lake Nasser has a numerous side extensions known as khors. Four khors were selected, two at the northern region (Kalabsha and Wadi-Abyad) and the others at southern (Tushka and Korosko). Seasonal study was carried out to estimate the quantitative and qualitative phytoplankton biochemical contents at the studied khors. Cyanophyceae was the most dominant group at the studied khors, where Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis flos-aquae, Lyngbya limnetica, Microcystis wesenbergii and Merismopedia glauca were the most dominant species. Protein represents the main biochemical content of phytoplankton at the khors, which generally reflects a physiologically healthy phytoplankton with high relative growth rates. Khor Korosko recorded the highest nutritive characters of phytoplankton proteins, carbohydrates and lipids (6.6 g/l, 14.2 and 4.45 mg/l), contrary to chlorophyll a which attained the least value of 71.4 mg/l. Winter was the optimum season for the measured biochemical contents; concurrently with high nitrate value. Flourishing of Copepoda and Cladocera in winter and highly fish muscle contents of protein and lipid at the same time may be attributed to the elevation of the biochemical contents of microalgae. High significant variation (p ≤ 0.05) was found between the four khors according to the studied phytoplankton biochemical parameters during winter.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Lake Nasser was high water quality and faces no threat of degradation due to local sources [1]. The shoreline of Lake Nasser is very irregular, with embayments called khors. There are about 85 long khors, 48 are on the east side and 37 on the west side. The existence of the khors increases greatly the length of the shore (8700 km), the mean length of the khors increases downstream from south to north and all are U-shaped in cross section. The khors surface area covers about 4900 km2 (79% of total lake surface); while their volume is 86.4 km3, i.e. 55% of the total lake volume [2,3]. Some khors as Kalabsha, El-Allaqi and Tushka are wide, with a sandy bottom and slope gently; others as El-Sabakha, Singari and Korosko are steep, relatively narrow with a rocky bottom [4].Algae can be used in the ecological risk assessment (ERA) to determine whether a problem exists, to infer levels of specific stressors in a targeted habitat within the water body [5]. Several factors can contribute to the nutritional value of microalgae, including its size and shape, digestibility (related to cell wall structure and composition), biochemical composition (proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) and the requirements of the animal feeding on the algae. Several studies have attempted to correlate the nutritional value of microalgae to their chemical profile [6,7].Phytoplankton serve as food for zooplankton which in turn serve as food to almost all larval forms (either meroplanktononic or holoplanktonic) in natural surface water [8]. It is widely known that the addition of microalgae to larval fish culture tanks confers a number of benefits, such as preventing bumping against the walls of the tanks [9], enhancing predation of zooplankton [10], enhancing the nutritional value of zooplankton [11], as well as improving larval digestive [12] and immune functions [13] and as important source of fish oil lipids (polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) and all the essential amino acids [14–17]. Cyanobacteria (especially Microcystis sp.) are an important constituent of Nile tilapia diet in Lake Victoria [18].The aim of this study is to explore, analyze and assess the quantitative and qualitative estimations of phytoplankton biochemical contents at the main khors of Lake Nasser (Tushka, Wadi-Abyad, Kalabsha and Korosko) in relation to the biological environmental conditions.
