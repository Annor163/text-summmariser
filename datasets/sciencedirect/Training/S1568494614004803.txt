This paper develops a new method for group decision making and introduces a linguistic continuous ordered weighted distance (LCOWD) measure. It is a new distance measure that combines the linguistic continuous ordered weighted averaging (LCOWA) operator with the ordered weighted distance (OWD) measure considering the risk attitude of decision maker. Moreover, it also can relieve the influence of extremely large or extremely small deviations on the aggregation results by assigning them smaller weights. These advantages make it suitable to deal with the situations where the input arguments are represented with uncertain linguistic information. Some of the main properties of the LCOWD measure and different particular cases are studied. The applicability of the new approach is also analyzed focusing on a group decision making problem.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problem is to find a desirable solution from a finite number of feasible alternatives assessed on multiple attributes by decision makers [1]. The fundamental prerequisite of MAGDM is how to aggregate individual decision maker's preference information on alternatives [2]. Information aggregation is a process which combines all individual decision makers’ preferences into an overall one by using a proper aggregation technique. A very useful technique for information aggregation is the OWA operator [3]. It provides a parameterized family of aggregation operators including the maximum, the minimum, the average, and others. Since its appearance, the OWA operator has been studied in a wide range of extensions including the ordered weighted geometric operator [4,5], the generalized OWA operator [6], the induced aggregation operators [7–9], the induced generalized OWA operator [10], the induced correlated aggregating operator [11], the generalized ordered weighted logarithm aggregation operator [12], the generalized multiple averaging operator [13], the power aggregation operator [14], the uncertain aggregation operators [15–17], the induced uncertain aggregation operator [18], the fuzzy generalized aggregation operator [19], the linguistic aggregation operators [20–29], the uncertain linguistic aggregation operators [30–32], the intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators [33–41], the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators [42,43], the fuzzy linguistic aggregation operators [44,45], the interval-valued fuzzy aggregation operators [46–48], and the hesitant fuzzy aggregation operator [49], etc. Moreover, Yager [50] presented the continuous ordered weighted averaging (COWA) operator where the aggregated arguments are interval numbers rather than finite values. And in [51], Yager and Xu developed the continuous ordered weighted geometric averaging (COWGA) operator. Zhou and Chen [52] generalized the COWA operator and obtained the continuous generalized OWA operator (CGOWA) operator. Wu et al. developed the induced continuous ordered weighted geometric operators [53], Chen and Zhou presented the induced generalized continuous ordered weighted averaging operator [54], Zhang and Xu extended the COWA operator to accommodate uncertain linguistic environment and obtained the linguistic COWA operator (LCOWA) operator [55].Another very practical technique for information aggregation is the distance measure which is used to compare the alternatives with some ideal results. By this comparison, the alternative closest to ideal results is the best one. Xu and Chen developed an ordered weighted distance (OWD) measure [56] which is the generalization of some widely used distance measure, including the normalized Hamming distance, the normalized Euclidean distance, the normalized geometric distance, the max distance, the median distance, and the minimized distance, etc. Merigó and Gil-Lafuente proposed the ordered weighted averaging distance (OWAD) operator [57] and the Euclidean ordered weighted averaging distance operator [58]. They also introduced the ordered weighted quasi-arithmetic distance operator by combining the ordered weighted quasi-arithmetic mean operator with the normalized Hamming distance [59]. Merigó [60] proposed the probabilistic weighted averaging distance operator that uses probabilities, weighted averages, and distance measures. Merigó et al. [61] investigated the probabilistic ordered weighted averaging distance operator by using a unified model between probabilities and the OWA operator. Merigó and Yager defined a new framework of moving distance aggregation operators [62] including the ordered weighted moving averaging distance and induced ordered weighted moving averaging distance. They generalized the application of distance measures with moving averages by using generalized aggregation operators and obtained the generalized ordered weighted moving averaging distance and the induced generalized ordered weighted averaging distance. Merigó and Casanovas developed several induced distance operators, including the induced ordered weighted averaging distance (IOWAD) operator [63], the induced Enclidean ordered weighted averaging distance (IEOWAD) operator [64] and the induced Minkowski OWA distance operator [65]. They presented the linguistic ordered weighted averaging distance operator [66] which provides a parameterized family of linguistic aggregation operators. Xu developed some fuzzy ordered distance measures [67], such as the linguistic ordered weighted distance measure, the uncertain ordered weighted distance measure, the linguistic hybrid weighted distance measure, and the uncertain hybrid weighted distance measure. Szmidt and Kacprzyk [68] defined the four basic distances between the intuitionistic fuzzy sets, including the Hamming distance, the normalized Hamming distance, the Enclidean distance, and the normalized Euclidean distance. Xu and Chen developed some continuous distance measures for intuitionistic fuzzy sets [69], and Zeng and Su proposed an intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted distance operator [70]. Xu and Yue investigated the distance measures for the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy matrices [71,72]. Xu and Xia presented a class of hesitant distance measures for the hesitant fuzzy sets [73,74].However, the distance measures of uncertain variables mentioned above are all defined based on the endpoints of interval numbers, which means that distance measures have uniform distributions on the corresponding interval variables. Obviously, it varies among group decision making problems under uncertain environment. Hence it is necessary that the risk attitude of decision makers should be properly considered in group decision making problems. To solve this problem, the continuous interval information aggregation operators will be employed to deal with the interval values. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new distance measure called the linguistic continuous ordered weighted distance (LCOWD) measure based on the LCOWA operator. Some properties and different families of the LCOWD measure are studied. Then the LCOWD measure is generalized and the Quasi LCOWD measure and the Heavy LCOWD measure are obtained.The prominent characteristic of the LCOWD measure is that it provides a parameterized family of distance operators. The decision makers consider the MAGDM problem more clearly according to their risk attitude in aggregation process. Another advantage of LCOWD measure is that it can relieve the influence of extremely large or extremely small deviations on aggregation results by assigning them smaller weights. Note that these characteristics make it suitable to deal with the situations where the input arguments are represented with uncertain linguistic information.We also propose a new approach to MAGDM in a group decision making problem by using different types of the LCOWD measures. It shows that the different decision results depend on the different particular type of parameters.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe some preliminaries. Section 3 presents the LCOWD measure and studies some properties. We also develop some extensions of the LCOWD measure. In Section 4, we present a method for multiple attribute group decision making with the LCOWD measure. In Section 5 an illustrative example is analyzed. In Section 6 we end the paper by summarizing the main conclusions.In this section, we briefly review the uncertain linguistic variable, the OWA operator, the generalized OWA (GOWA) operator, the COWA operator, the LCOWA operator, the distance measure, and the OWD measure.Let S={sα|α=−t, …, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …, t} be a linguistic label set with odd cardinality, which requires that the linguistic label set satisfies the following characteristics [74–77]:(1)The linguistic label set S is ordered: if sα, sβ∈S and α>β, then sα>sβ.There exists the negation operator: neg(sα)=sβsuch that α+β=0, where sαand sβrepresent possible values for the linguistic variables and t is a positive integer.The linguistic label set S is called the linguistic scale. For example, a set of nine labels S can be defined as:S={s−4=EL,s−3=VL,s−2=L,s−1=SL,s0=M,s1=SH,s2=H,s3=VH,s4=EH}.Note that EL=Extremely low, VL=Very low, L=Low, SL=Slightly low, M=Medium, SH=Slightly high, H=High, VH=Very high, EH=Extremely high.In order to preserve all the given information, the discrete linguistic label set S can be extended to a continuous linguistic label setS˜={sα|α∈[−q,q]},where q(q>t) is a sufficiently large positive integer. If sα∈S, we call sαthe original linguistic label, which can be used to evaluate alternatives by the decision makers, otherwise, we call sαthe virtual linguistic label, which only appears in operations.Definition 1Suppose thats˜=[sα,sβ]={x|sα≤x≤sβ},thens˜is called the uncertain linguistic variable, wheresα,sβ∈S˜,sα, sβare the lower and upper limits, respectively. Especially,s˜is called the linguistic variable if sα=sβ.Ifs˜=[sα,sβ],s˜1=[sα1,sβ1]ands˜2=[sα2,sβ2]are any three uncertain linguistic variables, and l, l1, l2∈[0, 1], then some operational laws can be defined as follows [31]:(1)s˜1⊕s˜2=[sα1,sβ1]⊕[sα2,sβ2]=[sα1⊕sα2,sβ1⊕sβ2]=[sα1+α2,sβ1+β2].s˜1⊕s˜2=s˜2⊕s˜1.ls˜=l[sα,sβ]=[slα,slβ].l1s˜⊕l2s˜=(l1+l2)s˜.l(s˜1⊕s˜2)=ls˜1⊕ls˜2.Let Ω be the set of all uncertain linguistic variables. For convenience, ifsα∈S˜,I(sα) denotes the subscript of additive linguistic label sα[76], then we have I(sα)=α.The OWA operator [3] is an aggregation operator that provides a parameterized family of aggregation operators between the minimum and the maximum, which has been studied in a wide range of applications [77–82]. It can be defined as follows:Definition 2An OWA operator of dimension n is a mapping OWA:Rn→R that has an associated weighting vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)with∑j=1nwj=1andwj∈[0,1],such thatSimilar to [15], it is possible to distinguish between the descending OWA (DOWA) operator and the ascending OWA (AOWA) operator by usingwj=wn−j+1*,where wjis the jth weight of the DOWA operator andwn−j+1*is the jth weight of the AOWA operator. The OWA operator is monotonic, commutative, bounded and idempotent. Other properties could be studied such as different families of the OWA operators, different measures for characterizing the weighting vector and the difference between descending and ascending orders [17,63,79,83–91].The generalized OWA (GOWA) operator was developed by Yager [6]. It uses generalized mean in the OWA operator, which can be defined as follows:Definition 3A GOWA operator is a mapping GOWA:Rn→R defined by an associated weighting vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)of dimension n, such that∑j=1nwj=1andwj∈[0,1],and a parameter p∈(−∞, ∞) and p≠0, according to the following formula:(2)GOWA(a1,a2,…,an)=∑j=1nwjbjp1/p,where bjis the jth largest of a1, a2, …, an.The GOWA operator is monotonic, commutative, bounded and idempotent [6]. If we consider the possible values of the parameter p in the GOWA operator, we can obtain a group of particular cases. For example, the OWA operator [3], the ordered weighted geometric averaging (OWGA) operator [4,5] and the ordered weighted harmonic averaging (OWHA) operator [9] are obtained as follows:•The OWA operator is found if p=1.The OWGA operator is obtained when p→0.The OWHA operator is formed when p=−1.In [50], Yager extended the OWA to uncertain environment and obtained the COWA operator. It can be defined as follows:Definition 4A COWA operator is a mapping F:Θ→R+ associated with a basic unit monotonic (BUM) function Q, such that(3)FQ(a)=FQ([aL,aU])=∫01dQ(y)dy(aU−y(aU−aL))dy,where Θ is the set of all nonnegative interval arguments and a=[aL, aU]∈Θ.Ifλ=∫01Q(y)dy,which is the attitudinal character of Q, then a general formulation of FQ(a) can be obtained as follows:(4)FQ(a)=FQ([aL,aU])=λaU+(1−λ)aL.As we can see, the COWA operator FQ(a) is always the weighted arithmetical mean of end points based on the attitudinal character. That is to say, the interval number [2]a can be replaced by FQ(a). Since its appearance, the COWA operator has attracted more and more attention from both decision makers and researchers [51–54,92,93].In [55], Zhang and Xu extended the COWA operator to linguistic environment and obtained the linguistic COWA operator, which can be defined as follows.Definition 5Ifs˜=[sα,sβ]∈Ω,and(5)fQ(s˜)=fQ([sα,sβ])=sγ,where(6)γ=FQ([I(sα),I(sβ)])=FQ([α,β]),then f is called the linguistic continuous OWA (LCOWA) operator, wheresα,sβ∈S˜and Q is the BUM function.Ifλ=∫01Q(y)dyis the attitudinal character of Q, then the LCOWA operator can be rewritten as follows:(7)fQ(s˜)=fQ([sα,sβ])=sλβ+(1−λ)α=λsβ⊕(1−λ)sα.From Eq. (7), we can see that the LCOWA operator may be determined by the attitudinal character λ. For convenience,fλ(s˜)denotesfQ(s˜),i.e.,(8)fλ(s˜)=fλ([sα,sβ])=λsβ⊕(1−λ)sα=sλβ+(1−λ)α.Definition 6Let A1, A2, A3 be the elements of a set. A distance measure must satisfy the following properties:•Nonnegativity: D(A1, A2)≥0.Commutativity: D(A1, A2)=D(A2, A1).Reflexivity: D(A1, A1)=0.Triangle inequality: D(A1, A2)+D(A2, A3)≥D(A1, A3).Using different function D, we are able to obtain different types of distance measures, such as the weighted Hamming distance [66] and the weighted Euclidean distance measure [58,64].Motivated by the idea of the GOWA operator, Xu and Chen [56] developed the ordered weighted distance (OWD) measure, which can be defined as follows:Definition 7An OWD measure is a mapping OWD:R+n×R+n→R+ that has an associated weighting vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)of dimension n, such that∑j=1nwj=1andwj∈[0,1],according to the following formula:The OWD measure is monotonic, bounded, idempotent and commutative. And if we consider the possible values of the parameter r in the OWD measure, we can obtain a group of particular cases, such as the ordered weighted Hamming distance (OWHD) measure, the ordered weighted geometric distance (OWGD) measure and the ordered weighted Euclidean distance (OWED) measure, which are obtained as follows:•The OWHD measure is found if r=1.The OWGD measure is obtained if r→0.The OWED measure is formed when r=2.In the following, we will introduce the linguistic continuous ordered weighted distance (LCOWD) measure, which is a distance measure that uses the LCOWA operator in the distance measure with uncertain linguistic variables.Definition 8Suppose thats˜1=[sα1,sβ1]∈Ωands˜2=[sα2,sβ2]∈Ω.IfSpecially, ifs˜1ands˜2are simple linguistic variables, thendλ(s˜1,s˜2)becomes the deviation measure proposed in [75].It can be seen easily that the smaller the value ofdλ(s˜1,s˜2),the nearer the uncertain linguistic variabless˜1ands˜2will be. With Eq. (8),dλ(s˜1,s˜2)can be expressed as follows:(13)dλ(s˜1,s˜2)=12t|I(sλβ1+(1−λ)α1)−I(sλβ2+(1−λ)α2)|=12t|λβ1+(1−λ)α1−(λβ2+(1−λ)α2)|,whereλ=∫01Q(y)dyis the attitudinal character of Q.From Definition 8, we can get the following theorems:Theorem 1Ifs˜1=[sα1,sβ1]∈Ω,s˜2=[sα2,sβ2]∈Ω,ands˜3=[sα3,sβ3]∈Ω,thenNonnegativity:dλ(s˜1,s˜2)≥0.Reflexivity:dλ(s˜1,s˜1)=0.Commutativity:dλ(s˜1,s˜2)=dλ(s˜2,s˜1).Transitivity: Ifdλ(s˜1,s˜2)=0anddλ(s˜2,s˜3)=0,thendλ(s˜1,s˜3)=0.Triangle inequality:dλ(s˜1,s˜3)≤dλ(s˜1,s˜2)+dλ(s˜2,s˜3).(1) By Eq. (12), we havedλ(s˜1,s˜2)=12t|I(fλ(s˜1))−I(fλ(s˜2))|≥0.(2) By Eq. (12), we obtaindλ(s˜1,s˜1)=12t|I(fλ(s˜1))−I(fλ(s˜1))|=0.(3) By Eq. (12), we getdλ(s˜1,s˜2)=12t|I(fλ(s˜1))−I(fλ(s˜2))|=12t|I(fλ(s˜2))−I(fλ(s˜1))|=dλ(s˜2,s˜1).(4) Ifdλ(s˜1,s˜2)=0anddλ(s˜2,s˜3)=0,then by Eq. (12), we haveI(fλ(s˜1))=I(fλ(s˜2))andI(fλ(s˜2))=I(fλ(s˜3)).Thus,I(fλ(s˜1))=I(fλ(s˜3)).That is to say,dλ(s˜1,s˜3)=12t|I(fλ(s˜1))−I(fλ(s˜3))|=0.(5) By Eq. (12), we get thatdλ(s˜1,s˜3)=12t|I(fλ(s˜1))−I(fλ(s˜3))|=12t|I(fλ(s˜1))−I(fλ(s˜2))+I(fλ(s˜2))−I(fλ(s˜3))|≤12t(|I(fλ(s˜1))−I(fλ(s˜2))|+|I(fλ(s˜2))−I(fλ(s˜3))|)=12t|I(fλ(s˜1))−I(fλ(s˜2))|+12t|I(fλ(s˜2))−I(fλ(s˜3))|=dλ(s˜1,s˜2)+dλ(s˜2,s˜3).Theorem 2Ifs˜1=[sα1,sβ1]∈Ω,s˜2=[sα2,sβ2]∈Ω,thendλ(s˜1,s˜2)≤1.By Definition 1, we get that −t≤α1, α2, β1, β2≤t, then|β1−β2|≤2t and |α1−α2|≤2t.By Eq. (13), we havedλ(s˜1,s˜2)=12t|λ(β1−β2)+(1−λ)(α1−α2)|≤12t(λ|β1−β2|+(1−λ)|α1−α2|)≤12t(λ×2t+(1−λ)×2t)=1.It can be seen from Theorems 1 and 2 that0≤dλ(s˜1,s˜2)≤1.Thus, motivated by [73], the similarity measure based on the LCOWA operator can be defined as follows:(14)sλ(s˜1,s˜2)=1−dλ(s˜1,s˜2).Obviously, the similarity measure based on the LCOWA operator can be considered as the dual of the distance measure. Note that discussions on the distance measure based on the LCOWA operator can be studied in a similar way for the similarity measure in this paper.Suppose thata˜=(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)∈Ωnandb˜=(b˜1,b˜2,…,b˜n)∈Ωn,we can define the linguistic continuous ordered weighted distance (LCOWD) measure as follows:Definition 9A LCOWD measure is a mapping LCOWD:Ωn×Ωn→R that has an associated weighting vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)of dimension n, such that∑j=1nwj=1andwj∈[0,1],according to the following formula:dλ(a˜j,b˜j)is the distance betweena˜jandb˜jbased on the LCOWA operator and the parameter μ>0.Specially, if alla˜jandb˜jare given in the form of linguistic variables, then the LCOWD measure is also called the linguistic ordered weighted distance (LOWD) measure.Moreover, we can develop an approach to determine the LCOWD weights based on the ordered distancesdλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j)):Letd¯=1n∑j=1ndλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j)),i.e.,d¯is the mean ofdλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j))(j=1,2,…,n),andΔdλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j))=|dλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j))−d¯|is the absolute distance betweendλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j))andd¯,then the similarity measure Eq. (14) can be revised as(17)sλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j))=1−Δdλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j))∑j=1nΔdλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j)),j=1,2,…,n.Thus, the LCOWD weights can be determined by the following formula:(18)wj=sλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j))∑j=1nsλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j)),j=1,2,…,n.In the following, we will present a simple example showing how to use the LCOWD operator in an aggregation process.Example 1Leta˜=([s2,s3],[s1,s3],[s−2,s0],[s−3,s−1],[s2,s4],[s0,s3])andb˜=([s1,s3],[s2,s3],[s−2,s−1],[s−3,s−1],[s2,s3],[s1,s3])be two collections of uncertain linguistic variables by using the following linguistic scales:If we assume that Q(y)=y2, thenλ=∫01Q(y)dy=1/3.By Eq. (13), we can getdλ(a˜1,b˜1)=|3/3+2×2/3−3/3−1×2/3|/(2×4)=1/12,dλ(a˜2,b˜2)=|3/3+1×2/3−3/3−2×2/3|/(2×4)=1/12,dλ(a˜3,b˜3)=|0/3+(−2)×2/3−(−1)/3−(−2)×2/3|/(2×4)=1/24,dλ(a˜4,b˜4)=|−1/3+(−3)×2/3−(−1)/3−(−3)×2/3|/(2×4)=0,dλ(a˜5,b˜5)=|4/3+2×2/3−3/3−2×2/3|/(2×4)=1/24,dλ(a˜6,b˜6)=|3/3+0×2/3−3/3−1×2/3|/(2×4)=1/12.Thus,dλ(a˜σ(1),b˜σ(1))=1/12,dλ(a˜σ(2),b˜σ(2))=1/12,dλ(a˜σ(3),b˜σ(3))=1/12,dλ(a˜σ(4),b˜σ(4))=1/24,dλ(a˜σ(5),b˜σ(5))=1/24,dλ(a˜σ(6),b˜σ(6))=0.Thend¯=0.0556,by Eq. (18), we getw1=0.1667,w2=0.1667,w3=0.1667,w4=0.1833,w5=0.1833,w1=0.1333.By Eq. (15), we can obtain the distances corresponding to some special cases of the parameter μ, which are shown in Table 1.From Table 1, the aggregation resultLCOWD(a˜,b˜)increases as the parameter μ steadily increases.As we can see, the prominent characteristic of the LCOWD measure is that it combines the GOWA operator with the distance measure based on the LCOWA operator in the same formula. On one hand, the decision maker is able to consider the MAGDM problem more clearly according to his/her risk attitude in aggregation process because the parameter λ, which lies in the interval [0,1], can be considered as the measure of the decision maker's attitudinal character. In the extreme case that λ=1, the decision make is very optimistic. On the other hand, when λ approaches zero, it indicates that the decision maker is very conservative. Therefore, in the decision making process, if decision maker is optimistic, then we can select the parameter λ→1, and if decision maker is pessimistic, then we can select the parameter λ→0. If decision maker is neutral, then we can select the parameter λ→0.5. The LCOWD measure can relieve the influence of extremely large or extremely small deviations on the aggregation results by assigning them smaller weights. Note that the LCOWD measure may be used to deal with deviations in aggregation on uncertain linguistic variables, which makes it very suitable to wide range situations, such as group decision making, economics and engineering.Note also that it is possible to distinguish between the descending LCOWD (DLCOWD) measure and the ascending LCOWD (ALCOWD) measure by usingwj=wn−j+1*,wherewjis the jth weight of the DLCOWD operator andwn−j+1*is the jth weight of the ALCOWD operator.The LCOWD measure is monotonic, idempotent, bounded, commutative, nonnegative and reflexive. These desirable properties are shown in the following theorems.Theorem 3 (Monotonicity–distance measure). Ifa˜=(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)∈Ωn,b˜=(b˜1,b˜2,…,b˜n)∈Ωn,c˜=(c˜1,c˜2,…,c˜n)∈Ωn,anddλ(a˜j,b˜j)≤dλ(a˜j,c˜j)for all j, then(19)LCOWD(a˜,b˜)≤LCOWD(a˜,c˜),where dλis the distance based on the LCOWA operator.Theorem 4 (Monotonicity–parameterμ). Ifa˜=(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)∈Ωn,b˜=(b˜1,b˜2,…,b˜n)∈Ωnand λ1≥λ2, then(20)LCOWDλ1(a˜,b˜)≥LCOWDλ2(a˜,b˜).Theorem 5 (Idempotency). Ifa˜=(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)∈Ωn,b˜=(b˜1,b˜2,…,b˜n)∈Ωnanddλ(a˜j,b˜j)=d0for all j, then(21)LCOWD(a˜,b˜)=d0.Theorem 6 (Boundedness). Ifa˜=(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)∈Ωn,b˜=(b˜1,b˜2,…,b˜n)∈Ωn,andmaxjdλ(a˜j,b˜j)=dmax,minjdλ(a˜j,b˜j)=dmin,then(22)dmin≤LCOWD(a˜,b˜)≤dmax.Theorem 7 (Commutativity–GOWA aggregation).

Ifa˜=(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)∈Ωn,b˜=(b˜1,b˜2,…,b˜n)∈Ωn,then(24)LCOWD(a˜,b˜)=LCOWD(b˜,a˜).Theorem 9 (Nonnegativity). Ifa˜=(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)∈Ωn,b˜=(b˜1,b˜2,…,b˜n)∈Ωn,then(25)LCOWD(a˜,b˜)≥0.Theorem 10 (Reflexivity). Ifa˜=(a˜1,a˜2,…,a˜n)∈Ωn,then(26)LCOWD(a˜,a˜)=0.By using different cases of the parameter μ and the weighting vector in the LCOWD measure, we are able to obtain different types of distance measure, such as the linguistic continuous ordered weighted Hamming distance (LCOWHD) measure, the linguistic continuous ordered weighted Euclidean distance (LCOWED) measure, the linguistic continuous ordered weighted geometric distance (LCOWGD) measure, the Median LCOWD measure, the Olympic LCOWD measure, etc.Remark 1If μ=1, then the LCOWD measure reduces to the LCOWHD measure:And if μ=2, then the LCOWD measure is reduced to the LCOWED measure:(28)LCOWED(a˜,b˜)=∑j=1nwj(d(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j)))21/2.If μ→0, then we obtain that(29)LCOWGD(a˜,b˜)=∏j=1n(d(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j)))wj,which is LCOWGD measure.Remark 2The linguistic continuous maximum distance (LCMAXD) measure, the linguistic continuous minimum distance (LCMIND) measure, the Step-LCOWD measure, the linguistic continuous normalized distance (LCND) measure, the linguistic continuous normalized Hamming distance (LCNHD) measure, the linguistic continuous normalized geometric distance (LCNGD) measure, the linguistic continuous normalized Euclidean distance (LCNED) measure and the Median LCOWD measure are obtained as follows:The LCMAXD measure is formed ifw1=1andwj=0for all j≠1.The LCMIND measure is found ifwn=1andwj=0for all j≠n.Generally, ifwk=1andwj=0for all j≠k, then we have the Step-LCOWD measure.The LCND measure is found whenwj=1/nfor all j. Specially, if μ=1, we get the LCNHD measure, and if μ→0, we obtain the LCNGD measure. If μ=2, we have the LCNED measure.Ifw(n+1)/2=1,wj=0for j≠(n+1)/2, n is odd, orwn/2=wn/2+1=1/2,wj=0for j≠n/2, n/2+1, then we get the Median LCOWD measure.Following the literatures [10,87,94], we can obtain a lot of families of LCOWD measures, such as:The Olympic LCOWD measure(w1=wn=0andwj=1/(n−2)for j≠1, n).The general Olympic LCOWD measure(wj=0for j=1, 2, …, k, n, n−1, …, n−k+1; and for all otherswj=1/(n−2k),where k<n/2).The Window LCOWD measure(wj=1/mfor k≤j≤k+m−1, andwj=0for j≥k+m and j<k).The generalized S-LCOWD measure ((wk=(1−(α+β))/n+α,wt=(1−(α+β))/n+βandwj=(1−(α+β))/nfor all j≠k, t, whereak=maxi{ai},at=mini{ai},and α+β≤1 with α, β∈[0, 1]).Ifa˜iandb˜i(i=1, 2, …, n) are all linguistic variables, then the LCOWD measure reduces to the linguistic ordered weighted distance (LOWD) measure. Specially, if we choose different values as the parameter μ, we can get some special cases of the LOWD measure. For example, the linguistic ordered weighted Hamming distance (LOWHD) measure, the linguistic ordered weighted Euclidean distance (LOWED) measure, the linguistic ordered weighted geometric distance (LOWGD) measure are found as follows:•The LOWHD measure is formed if μ=1.The LOWED measure is obtained when μ=2.The LOWGD measure is found when μ→0.Using a similar methodology, we can develop numerous families of the LCOWD measure following the literatures [86–91].Following [95], it is possible to develop an extension of the LCOWD measure by using the quasi-arithmetic mean instead of the generalized mean. It follows that the quasi-arithmetic LCOWD (Quasi-LCOWD) measure can be defined as follows:Definition 10A Quasi-LCOWD measure is a mapping Quasi-LCOWD:Ωn×Ωn→R that has an associated weighting vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)of dimension n, such that∑j=1nwj=1andwj∈[0,1],according to the following formula:(30)Quasi-LCOWD(a˜,b˜)=g−1∑j=1nwjg(dλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j))),where g is a strictly continuous monotonic function; σ(1), σ(2), …, σ(n) is any permutation of (1, 2, …, n), such thatdλ(a˜σ(j−1),b˜σ(j−1))≥dλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j)),j=2,3,…,n,dλ(a˜j,b˜j),is the distance betweena˜jandb˜jbased on the LCOWA operator and the parameter λ>0.The main advantage of the Quasi-LCOWD measure is that it provides a generalization of distance measure including a lot of special cases that are not included in the LCOWD measure. Specially, if g(x)=xμ, then we get the LCOWD measure.Another interesting extension is the heavy LCOWD (HLCOWD) measure, which can be defined as follows:Definition 11An HLCOWD measure is a mapping HLCOWD:Ωn×Ωn→R that has an associated weighting vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn)of dimension n such that1≤∑j=1nwj≤nandwj∈[0,1],according to the following formula:(31)HLCOWD(a˜,b˜)=∑j=1nwj(dλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j)))μ1/μ,where σ(1), σ(2), …, σ(n), … is any permutation of (1, 2, …, n, …), such thatdλ(a˜σ(j−1),b˜σ(j−1))≥dλ(a˜σ(j),b˜σ(j)),j=2, 3, …, n,dλ(a˜j,b˜j)is the distance betweena˜jandb˜jbased on the LCOWA operator and the parameter λ>0.As we can see, the difference between HLCOWD measure and the LCOWD measure is that the sum of the weights is allowed to be [1, n] instead of being to 1. The reason is that the available linguistic information cannot be aggregated with ordinary linguistic aggregation operators.A similar extension could be developed by combining the Quasi-LCOWD measure with the HLCOWD measure, then we can obtain the Quasi-HLCOWD measure. Some other interesting generalizations can be investigated following [18,19,94,96,97], such as the mixture LCOWD measure, the infinitary LCOWD measure, the LCOWD weighted average measure, etc.The LCOWD measure is applicable in a wide range of situations, such as decision making, economics, statistics and engineering. In this section, we consider a multiple attributes group decision making problem by using LCOWD measure.Let X={x1, x2, …, xm} be a discrete set of m feasible alternatives, and U={u1, u2, …, un} be a finite set of attributes. Let E={e1, e2, …, et} be the set of decision makers, andv=(v1,v2,…,vt)be the weighting vector of decision makers satisfyingvk∈[0,1]and∑k=1tvk=1.Assume that each decision maker provides his/her own decision matrixA˜(k)=(a˜ij(k))m×n,wherea˜ij(k)∈Ω,for the alternative xi∈X with respect to the attribute uj∈U. Letw=(w1,w2,…,wn)be the weighting vector of attributes satisfyingwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1.The process with the LCOWD measure in multiple attributes group decision making involves the following steps:Step 1: Form the ideal alternative by giving the ideal levels of each characteristic, which is shown in Table 2, where x(k) is the ideal alternative andy˜j(k)is the jth ideal characteristic of x(k).Step 2: Calculate the distance of each preference valuea˜ij(k)provided by the decision maker ekand his/her ideal preference valuey˜j(k)by Eq. (32):(32)dλ(a˜ij(k),y˜j(k))=12t|λa˜ij(k)U+(1−λ)a˜ij(k)L−λy˜j(k)U−(1−λ)y˜j(k)L|,i=1,2,…,m,j=1,2,…,n,k=1,2,…,t.whereλ=∫01Q(y)dyis the attitudinal character of Q.Step 3. Utilize the LCOWD measure(33)r˜ik=LCOWD(a˜i(k),y˜(k)),i=1,2,…,m,k=1,2,…,t,to aggregate all distances into a collective distance matrixR˜=(r˜ik)m×t,wherea˜i(k)=(a˜i1(k),a˜i2(k),…,a˜in(k))andy˜(k)=(y˜1(k),y˜2(k),…,y˜n(k)).Step 4: Utilize the GOWA operatorr˜i=GOWA(r˜i1,r˜i2,…,r˜it),i=1, 2, …, m, to derive the collective overall preference valuer˜iof the alternative xi.Step 5: Rank the collective overall preference valuesr˜i(i=1,2,…,m)in ascending order.Step 6: Rank all the alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, m) and select the best one(s) in accordance with the collective overall preference valuesr˜i(i=1,2,…,m).The best choice is the one with the smallest distance.Step 7: End.In the following, we develop a brief illustrative example of the new approach in a group decision making problem. We study an investment selection problem where an investment company wants to invest a sum of money in the best option (adapted from [98]). After analyzing the market, the company considers five possible alternatives in which to invest the money:x1 is a car industry.x2 is a food company.x3 is a computer company.x4 is an arms company.x5 is a TV company.In order to assess these alternatives, the investment company has brought together a group of experts. The group of company experts is constituted by three persons (weighting vector v=(0.35, 0.25, 0.4)T). After careful review of the information, they summarize the ability of companies with four attributes U={u1, u2, u3, u4}:u1 is the risk analysis.u2 is the growth analysis.u3 is the social-political impact analysis.u4 is the environmental impact analysis.Assume that the five possible alternatives are evaluated using the linguistic label setS={s−4=EP,s−3=VP,s−2=P,s−1=SP,s0=F,s1=SG,s2=G,s3=VG,s4=EG}.Note that EP=Extremely poor, VP=Very poor, P=Poor, SP=Slightly poor, F=Fair, SG=Slightly good, G=Good, VG=Very good, EG=Extremely good.The three decision makers construct the decision matricesA˜(k)=(a˜ij(k))5×4(k=1,2,3),respectively, and the results are shown in Tables 3–5.With this information, we can use the proposed decision making method to get the ranking of the companies. The following steps are involved:Step 1. Each decision maker establishes his/her own ideal investment. The results are shown in Table 6.Step 2: Calculate the distance of each preference valuea˜ij(k)provided by the decision maker ekand his/her ideal preference valuey˜j(k)with Eq. (32), and the results are shown in Tables 7–9, where Q(y)=y3 and λ=1/4.Step 3. Utilize the LCOWD measure to aggregate all distance into a collective distance matrixR˜=(r˜ik)m×t,where μ=1.5 andr˜11=s0.0979,r˜12=s0.1263,r˜13=s0.1449,r˜21=s0.1208,r˜22=s0.1521,r˜23=s0.1404,r˜31=s0.1787,r˜32=s0.0852,r˜33=s0.1158,r˜41=s0.2522,r˜42=s0.0881,r˜43=s0.1189,r˜51=s0.1506,r˜52=s0.1316,r˜53=s0.1472.Step 4: Utilize the GOWA operator to derive the collective overall preference valuer˜iof the alternative xi:r˜1=s0.1223,r˜2=s0.1370,r˜3=s0.1288,r˜4=s0.1617,r˜5=s0.1423.Assume that the parameter μ in the GOWA operator is equal to the parameter μ in the LCOWD measure.Step 5: Rank the collective overall preference valuesr˜i(i=1,2,…,5)in ascending order:r˜1<r˜3<r˜2<r˜5<r˜4.Step 6: Rank all the alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, 5) and select the best one(s) in accordance with the collective overall preference valuesr˜i(i=1,2,…,5):x1≻x3≻x2≻x5≻x4.As we can see, the best one is x1. That is to say, optimal alternative is the car industry.Furthermore, in order to analyze how the different particular cases of the LCOWD measure have affection for the aggregation results, in this example, we consider the LCMAXD measure, the LCMIND measure, the DLCOWD measure, the ALCOWD measure, the LCOWHD measure, the LCOWED measure, the LCOWGD measure, the LCND measure, the LCNHD measure, the LCNGD measure, the LCNED measure, the Median LCOWD measure and the Step LCOWD measure (k=2). The results are shown in Tables 10 and 11.We can establish an ordering of the companies for each special distance measure. The results are shown in Table 12. Note that “≻” means “preferred to” and “∼” means “equivalent to”.As we can see, depending on the particular cases of the LCOWD measure used, the ordering of the companies is different.Moreover, it is possible to analyze how the different BUM function Q(y) plays a role in the aggregation results, in this case, we consider different values of attitudinal character λ∈[0, 1], which are provided by the decision makers, where μ=1.5. The results are shown in Fig. 1.As we can see, depending on the particular cases of the attitudinal character λ used, the ordering results of companies are different, thus resulting in different decisions. However, it seems that x3 is the best choice when λ≥0.3236, and x1 is also the best one when λ≤0.3236.We can also analyze how the different parameter μ affects the aggregation results, considering different values of parameter μ∈(0, +∞), which are provided by the decision makers, where λ=1/4. The results are shown in Fig. 2.As we can see, depending on the particular cases of the parameter μ used, the ordering results of companies are different, thus resulting in different decisions. However, x2 is the best choice when μ≥8.778 and μ≤4.2448, and x1 is also the best one when 4.2448≤μ≤8.778.Furthermore, if we analyze how the parameter λ and μ play the roles on the aggregation results simultaneously, we can calculater˜1,r˜2,r˜3,r˜4,r˜5,respectively, by considering λ∈[0, 1] and μ∈(0, 150], then the results are shown in Figs. 3–7.It is observed from Figs. 3–7 thatr˜1,r˜2andr˜5increase monotonically as the parameters λ and μ increase.r˜3first decreases and then increases as λ and μ increase. The other result,r˜4decreases as λ and μ increase. This shows that the LCOWD measure is effective in application of group decision making.In [98] Herrera and Herrera-Viedma analyzed the steps to follow in the linguistic decision analysis of a multiple attributes decision making problem by using some linguistic models rather than linguistic aggregation operators or linguistic distance measures. Ref. [30] developed the uncertain linguistic ordered weighted averaging (ULOWA) operator and the uncertain linguistic hybrid aggregation (ULHA) operators. And in [31], Xu introduced some induced uncertain linguistic OWA (IULOWA) operators and their applications to group decision making problem with uncertain linguistic information. Compared with the approaches proposed in [30,31], the significant feature of this study is that the LCOWD measure uses the risk attitude of decision maker in the linguistic distance, in which the weighting vector of attributes is completely determined by the preference values.In this paper, the LCOWD measure has been introduced by combining the LCOWA operator with the generalized distance measure. Furthermore, the Quasi-LCOWD measure and the HLCOWD measure have been put forward. Compared with the existing approaches for uncertain linguistic multiple attributes group decision making, the proposed method has two desired features:(1)The LCOWD measure uses generalized distance measure with the risk attitude of decision maker to measure the difference between preference values and ideal values in group decision making. It makes the decision depends on the decision maker thoroughly.By developing the similarity measure of preference values, the weighting vector of attributes is reached, which guarantees the theoretical foundations of effectiveness of proposed method.The feasible future research issues could be focused on extensions of LCOWD measure to other types of distances measures and aggregation schemes. Additional interesting topic for future study is to apply the LCOWD measure to different practical problems with a group of decision makers.
