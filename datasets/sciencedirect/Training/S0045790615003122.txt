@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Designing a lightweight, secure communication protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) remains a challenging issue since sensor networks are resource limited and are left unattended. Sensor nodes in WSNs are subjected to varying forms of attacks. An adversary may destroy or damage the communications done in multi-hop WSNs by means of packet dropping and modification. Hence it is essential to have an efficient cryptographic scheme to protect the communications done in WSNs. This study introduces a Reliable Anonymous Secure Packet forwarding (RASP) scheme that can prevent not only traffic analysis attack but also the attacks done through compromised forwarding nodes. The mechanisms followed here are effective with low computation and communication overhead. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated over NS2 with a series of simulation. The simulated results show that the proposed scheme performs better than other comparable schemes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Rapidly developed WSN technology is widely used in different types of applications due to its economic and viable nature. A WSN is composed of a large number of sensor nodes which are connected through wireless links. The sensor nodes send data to Base Station (BS) through multi-hop transmission. The Wireless nature of communication, resource limitation on sensor nodes and unknown network topology prior to deployment makes the sensor nodes vulnerable to various security attacks [1,2]. From the security standpoint it is essential to provide authentic and accurate data to the BS. Previous security schemes focus on security services such as authenticity, confidentiality and integrity [3]. In addition to these services, many applications of WSNs have special requirements in terms of privacy and security [4,5].Different key management schemes [6–8] have been developed to ensure data security in different circumstances for WSNs. Security relevant issues in WSNs and the issue of key establishment are considered in this literature [6]. Key predistribution through public key cryptography has been demonstrated in [7]. Energy limitation of sensor nodes make the use of public key systems impractical for WSNs. Security in hierarchical WSNs can be achieved using combinatorial designs [8,9]. This scheme assigns key chains to sensor nodes before deployment which reduces communication overhead. However, it requires more key space and it is not an energy efficient mechanism. To overcome these issues full pairwise key management scheme can be adopted [10]. This is achieved by sharing pairwise key between neighbouring nodes. In a WSN with ‘n’ nodes each node desires its key to be predistributed with n−1 nodes [11]. This scheme causes storage of large number of keys in each node. Moreover, maintaining forward and backward secrecy through this scheme is also a challenging task. If a node is compromised all the secure links connecting the compromised node with other nodes get affected. To reduce the node compromisation probability random key predistribution scheme can be followed. In random key predistribution process each node is assigned with a ring of keys selected randomly from a key pool [11]. But when a node is compromised all its keys and all the links secured by these keys are also compromised.Recently many approaches have been proposed for providing hop-by-hop authentication [12]. These mechanisms need to share pairwise key between consecutive neighbouring nodes along with the selected path. But these schemes may function efficiently if all the links in the network are highly resilient to compromisation. [13].The proposed RASP mechanism considers security and privacy as important concern in packet forwarding. Further, it avoids unauthorised and infected traffic from being forwarded to the next hop. Simulation results and analytical studies verify the achievability of the proposed scheme.The key contributions of the proposed scheme are as follows:•This scheme ensures reliability in communication by selecting optimal forwarding nodes which avoids frequent failure of nodes along with the selected path.It preserves the privacy of the sensor nodes involved in communication through the security service anonymity. This feature prevents the occurrence of traffic analysis attack.Incremental hash based authentication technique is followed in this scheme which allows immediate authentication of the packets received. This mechanism prevents compromised data from being forwarded in the network.For the reason of clarity, the notations used throughout this study are listed in Table1.The rest part of the paper is organised as follows. Some literatures related to the proposed scheme are discussed in Section 2. Section 3 presents the detailed description of the proposed scheme, followed by analysis and discussion in Section 4. Analysis through simulation is presented in section 5. The proposed mechanism is concluded in Section 6.
