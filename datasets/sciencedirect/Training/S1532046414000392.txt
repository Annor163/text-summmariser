Secondary use of clinical data: The Vanderbilt approach

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We developed a secondary use data infrastructure to serve the Vanderbilt research community.The data layer consists of identified and de-identified resources.The utilization layer consists of tools and services that are researcher-centric.Secondary use of clinical data for research is a complex task but it benefits the entire medical center community.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The last decade has seen an exponential growth in the quantity of clinical data collected nationwide, triggering an increase in opportunities to reuse the data for biomedical research. The Vanderbilt research data warehouse framework consists of identified and de-identified clinical data repositories, fee-for-service custom services, and tools built atop the data layer to assist researchers across the enterprise. Providing resources dedicated to research initiatives benefits not only the research community, but also clinicians, patients and institutional leadership. This work provides a summary of our approach in the secondary use of clinical data for research domain, including a description of key components and a list of lessons learned, designed to assist others assembling similar services and infrastructure.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Over the last decade, the transition from paper medical records to electronic clinical systems has been accelerated by a national emphasis on modernizing our health care infrastructure. Legislative initiatives, such as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 [1], which includes monetary incentives (and ultimately penalties), requires providers to show “meaningful use” of certified electronic health records (EHRs). This resulted in a significant growth in the amount of clinical data being collected. The transition from paper to electronic clinical systems has also created new opportunities for secondary use of clinical data in biomedical research. Rapid cohort identification, quality of care assessment, comparative effectiveness research, data privacy and de-/re-identification research, phenotyping methodology and predictive modeling represent a handful of areas where ready access to clinical data for research endeavors is beginning to make a real impact at academic medical centers across the country.In 2006, responding to national trends, the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) compiled a set of recommendations [2] that defined challenges and stressed benefits of research-driven secondary use of clinical data. MacKenzie et al. [3] surveyed 35 Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) organizations and the NIH Clinical Center in 2008 and 2010, reporting a positive trend for institutional development, management and utilization of integrated data repositories to support the research enterprise. Primary obstacles reported in the 2010 survey included data quality and standards issues related to assembling a common repository from multiple systems, sustainable funding to support infrastructure and operations, and meaningful data access services provided to research teams. In 2012, Murphy et al. [4] surveyed 17 institutions and observed a significant increase in the clinical repositories used for research since 2007. In 2013, Embi et al. [5] surveyed clinical research informatics (CRI) papers published in scientific journal and conference proceedings from 2009 to 2013 and observed six common themes: (1) clinical data reuse for research; (2) data and knowledge management, discovery and standards; (3) researcher support and resources; (4) participant recruitment; (5) patients/consumers and CRI; and (6) policy, regulatory and fiscal matters. Large-scale, integrated data repositories are foundational for work in many of these areas, resulting in a growing number of academic medical centers assembling big data programs to support the local research enterprise. Examples include Intermountain Healthcare [6], Massachusetts General Hospital [7], the Mayo Clinic [8], Columbia University Medical Center [9] and Stanford Medical Center [10]. Data exploration tools such as i2b2 [11] and Harvest [12] have been designed to directly support researcher data inquiry needs, though a combination of tools and human expert support are typically needed for optimal enterprise-wide researcher support.Beginning in the early 1990s, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) began a series of clinical informatics initiatives [13,14] resulting largely in the elimination of paper medical records by 2004 [15]. Vanderbilt’s current clinical framework consists of a variety of software systems, both off-the-shelf commercial solutions and applications developed in house. A centralized transactional messaging engine called the Generic Interface Engine (GIE) manages communication and information exchange between systems. This early adoption and integration of electronic clinical information systems have had significant impact in the domains of clinical care, patient safety, provider accountability, and improved documentation [16–19]. The end result of our early launch and continuously evolving clinical systems is an information-rich environment covering 2million patients, with longitudinal records spanning more than a decade.For a long time at Vanderbilt, the EHR system (StarPanel) and an enterprise data warehouse (EDW) were the two main repositories of clinical and billing data. The need for a dedicated research framework emerged because common data repositories represent only half of the solution. Researchers need secure and reliable access to data programmers and/or self-service tools to query data, and must understand the meaning and structure of data elements to avoid making naïve assumptions. This paper provides a description of Vanderbilt’s approach to secondary use of clinical data and presents a set of practical ”lessons learned” that could prove useful for other institutions considering assembling similar infrastructure and data access services.
