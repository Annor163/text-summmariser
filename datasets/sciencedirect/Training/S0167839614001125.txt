@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Theμ-invariantμ=(μ1,μ2,μ3)of a rational space curve gives important information about the curve. In this paper, we describe the structure of all parameterizations that have the sameμ-type, what we call aμ-stratum, and as well the closure of strata. Many of our results are based on papers by the second author that appeared in the commutative algebra literature. We also present new results, including an explicit formula for the codimension of the locus of non-proper parametrizations within eachμ-stratum and a decomposition of the smallestμ-stratum based on which two-dimensional rational normal scroll the curve lies on.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A rational curve of degree n in projective 3-space is parametrized by(1.1)F(s,t)=(a0(s,t),a1(s,t),a2(s,t),a3(s,t))wherea0,a1,a2,a3are relatively prime homogeneous polynomials of degree n. If F is generically one-to-one anda0,a1,a2,a3are linearly independent, then the image curve C has degree n and does not lie in a plane, i.e., C is a genuine space curve.For a parametrized planar curve of degree n, Cox et al. (1998) introduced the idea of a μ-basis. Since then, μ-bases have proved useful in the study of the singularities of rational plane curves, as evidenced by Chen et al. (2008), Song et al. (2007) in the geometric modeling literature and by Cox et al. (2013) in the commutative algebra literature.The groundwork for the space curve case appears in Cox et al. (1998, Sec. 5), and the connection with singularities has been studied in several papers, including Jia et al. (2010), Shi and Chen (2010), Shi et al. (2013), Wang et al. (2009). For references to the (fairly extensive) algebraic geometry literature on rational space curves, we direct the reader to the bibliography of Iarrobino (2014).An idea introduced in Cox et al. (1998) was to study the μ-stratum consisting of all parametrizations of plane rational curves with given degree and μ-type. In this paper, we will extend this idea to rational space curves and more generally to define theμ-strata of rational curves in projective d-space, based on the papers by Iarrobino (1977, 2004). A terse version of the results presented in Sections 3 and 4.2, written for commutative algebraists, can be found in Iarrobino (2014). The results concerning properness in Section 4.1 are new to this paper and this topic is not mentioned in Iarrobino (1977, 2004). Results concerning the decomposition of the smallestμ-stratum are geometric consequences of Iarrobino (2004), but were not developed there.We will review the planar case in Section 2 and then discussμ-strata in higher dimensions in Section 3. We will give examples to illustrate the unexpected behaviors that can arise. Section 4 will study non-proper parametrizations and explain how parametrizations in the smallestμ-stratum relate to two-dimensional rational normal scrolls inPd. Proofs will be given in Appendix A.For the rest of the paper, we will work over an arbitrary infinite fieldk, which in practice is usuallyk=RorC. SetR=k[s,t]and letRnbe the subspace consisting of homogeneous polynomials of degree n.A rational curve in the projective plane is parametrized by(2.1)F(s,t)=(a0(s,t),a1(s,t),a2(s,t)),wherea0,a1,a2∈Rn. In this section, we will assume thata0,a1,a2are relatively prime and linearly independent and that F is generically one-to-one.A moving line of degree m is a polynomialA0(s,t)x+A1(s,t)y+A2(s,t)zwithA0,A1,A2∈Rm. It follows the parametrization if(2.2)A0a0+A1a1+A2a2=0inR.A μ-basis for F consists of a pair of moving linesp,qthat follow the parametrization and have the property that any moving line that follows the parametrization is a linear combination (with polynomial coefficients) of p and q. Assumingdeg⁡(p)≤deg⁡(q), one setsμ=deg⁡(p), so thatdeg⁡(q)=n−μsince it is known thatdeg⁡(p)+deg⁡(q)=n. In this situation, we say that F has type μ (this is the terminology used in Shi et al., 2013). Thus the μ-type is the minimum degree of a moving line that follows F. Note that1≤μ≤⌊n/2⌋sincea0,a1,a2are linearly independent andμ≤n−μ.To connect this with algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, we introduce the idealI=〈a0,a1,a2〉⊆R. Then, as explained in Cox et al. (1998), the Hilbert Syzygy Theorem gives an exact sequence(2.3)0⟶R(−n−μ)⊕R(−2n+μ)→AR(−n)3→BI⟶0,where B is given by(a0,a1,a2)and A is the3×2matrix whose columns are the coefficients of p and q, andBA=0. The notationR(−n−μ),R(−2n+μ),R(−n)reflects the degree shifts needed to make the maps in (2.3) preserve degrees. We note that μ-bases and μ-types appeared in the algebraic geometry literature as early as 1986 (see Ascenzi, 1986, 1988).When we think of p and q as columns of the matrix A, then the Hilbert–Burch Theorem asserts that the cross productp×qis the parametrization(a0,a1,a2), up to multiplication by a nonzero constant. This feature makes it easy to create parametrizations with given μ-type: just choose generic p and q of respective degrees μ andn−μand take their cross product.To study all parametrizations with the same μ-type, we begin with the subsetPn⊆Rn3consisting of all relatively prime linearly independent triples(a0,a1,a2)for which the parametrization is generically one-to-one. Then, for1≤μ≤⌊n/2⌋, we have the μ-stratumPnμ={(a0,a1,a2)∈Pn|(a0,a1,a2)has typeμ}.In Cox et al. (1998), it was proved thatPnμis irreducible of dimension(2.4)dim⁡(Pnμ)={3(n+1),ifμ=⌊n/2⌋,2n+2μ+4,ifμ<⌊n/2⌋.The μ-stratumPnμis not closed inPn. LetP¯nμdenote its Zariski closure inPn. In Cox et al. (1998), it was conjectured that(2.5)P¯nμ=Pn1∪⋯∪Pnμ.This was proved by D'Andrea (2004). This result also is a consequence of the memoir by Iarrobino (1977) or the article by Iarrobino (2004), though these are written from a very different viewpoint. It was eight years after D'Andrea (2004) appeared before a connection was made between these papers.Here is the intuition behind (2.4) and (2.5):•(2.4) says that the smaller the μ, the more special the parametrization.(2.5) says that if we are moving around inPnμand reach its boundary, then with high probability, we hit a point ofPnμ−1, i.e., μ drops by one unless we are really unlucky.Curves in the plane and 3-dimensional space are the most important to geometric modeling. Since the results of Iarrobino (1977, 2004) apply to curves in projective d-space for alld≥1, we will work in this greater generality. One way to think of our approach is that it gives a unified treatment of rational plane and space curves, as well as rational curves in higher dimensions.We therefore start withd+1homogeneous polynomialsa0,…,ad∈Rn. Then the functionF(s,t)=(a0(s,t),…,ad(s,t))parametrizes a curve in projective d-space, generalizing (1.1) and (2.1). We will assume thata0,…,adare linearly independent, which implies that the image curve is not contained in a hyperplane. Note also that the spanSpan(a0,…,ad)is a(d+1)-dimensional subspace ofRn. This is important, since the results of Iarrobino (1977, 2004) forR=k[s,t]are stated in terms of subspaces ofRnof a given dimension, equal tod+1in our situation. We will say more about this in Appendix A.In Section 2, we made two assumptions beyond linear independence:•The parametrization is proper, i.e., generically one-to-one, andthe polynomials in the parametrization are relatively prime.Before stating our results, we need to defineμ-types andμ-bases.Proposition 3.1Leta0,…,ad∈Rnbe linearly independent and letI=〈a0,…,ad〉⊆Rbe the ideal generated bya0,…,ad. Then there exist integersμ1,…,μd≥1and an exact sequence(3.1)0⟶⨁i=1dR(−n−μi)→AR(−n)d+1→BI⟶0.Furthermore, if we seth=gcd⁡(a0,…,ad), thenμ1+⋯+μd=n−c,c=deg⁡(h), andB=(a0,…,ad)consists of h times the maximal minors of A (up to sign).ProofLeth=gcd⁡(a0,…,ad)and setbi=ai/h. Thengcd⁡(b0,…,bd)=1anddeg⁡(bi)=n−csincec=deg⁡(h). The results of Cox et al. (1998, Sec. 5) apply tob0,…,bd, so that we have an exact sequence0⟶⨁i=1dR(−n−c−μi)→AR(−n−c)d+1→B˜〈b0,…,bd〉⟶0,whereB˜=(b0,…,bd)and A is a(d+1)×dmatrix whose columns form a basis of the module of moving hyperplanesA0x0+⋯+Adxdthat follow the parametrization given by(b0,…,bd). Sincedeg⁡(bi)=n−c, Cox et al. (1998) also implies thatμ1+⋯+μd=n−c. Sinceai=hbiandh≠0, we have∑i=1dAiai=0⟺∑i=1dAibi=0.SettingB=hB˜gives the exact sequence (3.1). Thebiare (up to sign) the maximal minors of A by Cox et al. (1998), and the final assertion of the proposition follows.  □If we requireμ1≤⋯≤μd, then the d-tuple(3.2)μ=(μ1,…,μd)is uniquely determined by(a0,…,ad). We call (3.2) theμ-type of(a0,…,ad), and the columns of the matrix A in (3.1) form aμ-basis. Note that whend=2andgcd⁡(a0,a1,a2)=1, Proposition 3.1 tells us that theμ-type can be writtenμ=(μ,n−μ).Hence we recover the μ-type in the planar case when the polynomials are relatively prime.Remark 3.2We use “μ” in two ways in this paper. When followed by a hyphen, as inμ-type,μ-basis orμ-stratum, theμis part of the notation and has no specific value. But when used by itself,μdenotes a vector of integers, such asμ=(1,2,3).To state our first result, letPn,d⊆Rnd+1consist of all(a0,…,ad)∈Rnd+1such thata0,…,adare linearly independent and relatively prime. Linear independence means that the image of the parametrization does not lie in any hyperplane ofPd. We will always assume thatn≥d(otherwisePn,dis empty) andd≥2(curves inP1are not interesting). One can show thatPn,dis a nonempty Zariski open subset ofRnd+1, i.e., the complement of a proper closed subvariety ofRnd+1.Given integers with1≤μ1≤⋯≤μd, we setμ=(μ1,…,μd)and|μ|=μ1+⋯+μd. We callμa d-part partition. (Many references write partitions in descending order, e.g.,7=4+2+1. We use ascending order since this is howμ-bases are written in the geometric modeling literature.)Ifμis a d-part partition of n (son=|μ|), then we define theμ-stratum(3.3)Pn,dμ={(a0,…,ad)∈Pn,d|(a0,…,ad)has typeμ}.This set has the following structure.Theorem 3.3Assume that μ is a d-part partition of n. ThenPn,dμis a Zariski open subset of a subvariety ofRnd+1≃k(d+1)(n+1). Furthermore,Pn,dμis irreducible of dimensiondim⁡(Pn,dμ)=(d+1)(n+1)−∑i>jmax⁡(0,μi−μj−1).The proofs of all theorems in this section will be given in Appendix A.Example 3.4In the plane case, we haved=2andμ=(μ,n−μ). Here,Pn,dμ=Pnμas defined in Section 2, and then Theorem 3.3 implies thatdim⁡(Pnμ)=3(n+1)−max⁡(0,(n−μ)−μ−1)={3(n+1),ifn−μ=μ,i.e.,μ=⌊n/2⌋,2n+2μ+4,ifn−μ>μ,i.e.,μ<⌊n/2⌋,in agreement with (2.4).Example 3.5A space curve case studied in Jia et al. (2010) isμ=(1,1,n−2). Assumingn≥4, one computes thatdim⁡(Pn,3μ)=4(n+1)−2max⁡(0,(n−2)−1−1)=2n+12.We will soon see that this is the smallestμ-stratum ofPn,3.In general,Pn,dμis not a subvariety ofPn,d. We letP¯n,dμdenote its Zariski closure inPn,d, i.e., the smallest subvariety ofPn,dcontainingPn,dμ. Theorem 3.3 tells us thatPn,dμis Zariski open inP¯n,dμ. The theorem also implies thatP¯n,dμis irreducible withdim⁡(P¯n,dμ)=dim⁡(Pn,dμ).The expectation is that the complementP¯n,dμ∖Pn,dμshould consist of “smaller”μ-strata. We compare differentμ-types as follows.Definition 3.6Given d-part partitionsμandμ′, we defineμ≤μ′providedμ1≤μ1′,μ1+μ2≤μ1′+μ2′,…,μ1+⋯+μd≤μ1′+⋯+μd′.Note thatμ≤μ′implies|μ|≤|μ′|.We can now describe the Zariski closure ofPn,dμinPn,d. Recall from the discussion leading up to (3.3) that allμ-strata occurring inPn,dsatisfy|μ|=n.Theorem 3.7The Zariski closure ofPn,dμinPn,disP¯n,dμ=⋃μ′≤μPn,dμ′.Sinceμ-strata are disjoint, this theorem implies thatP¯n,dμ∖Pn,dμ=⋃μ′<μPn,dμ′, confirming our intuition thatP¯n,dμ∖Pn,dμis a union of smaller strata.Example 3.8Since(μ,n−μ)≤(μ′,n−μ′)if and only ifμ≤μ′, we see that Theorem 3.7 reduces to (2.5) whend=2.Example 3.9One easily checks that(1,1,n−2)≤μfor all 3-part partitionsμof n. This and Theorem 3.7 justify our earlier claim thatPn,3(1,1,n−2)is the smallestμ-stratum ofPn,3. Proposition 3.12 will describe the smallestμ-stratum ofPn,d.Example 3.10Sextic curves in dimension 3 have been studied in Jia et al. (2010). Here, the stratification is especially simple since the 3-part partitions of 6 are given by(1,1,4)≤(1,2,3)≤(2,2,2). HenceP6,3=P6,328(2,2,2)∪P6,327(1,2,3)∪P6,324(1,1,4),and the Zariski closure of each stratum consists of that stratum together with those to the right of it in the above union. The small subscript gives the dimension of each stratum.Example 3.11Whend=3, the smallest n for which incomparableμ-types exist isn=9, and the types in question are(1,4,4)and(2,2,5). This gives the following stratification ofP9,3:Here, we have writtenP9,3dim(μ1,μ2,μ3)more simply as(μ1,μ2,μ3)dim, where “dim” gives the dimension of the stratum. The closure of a stratum consists of the stratum and everything strictly below it in the diagram.One consequence of the diagram is that if we move around inP9,3(2,3,4)and reach its boundary, then with high probability we hit a point in eitherP9,3(2,2,5)orP9,3(1,4,4), and these possibilities are equally likely since both have codimension 3 inP¯9,3(2,3,4).The stratification ofP9,3shown in Example 3.11 hasμ=(3,3,3)at the top: it is the maximum stratum in the partial order of Definition 3.6 and it is also the unique stratum having the largest dimension 40. The stratumμ=(1,1,7)at the bottom is the minimum in the partial order of Definition 3.6 and also the unique stratum of smallest dimension 20. This generalizes as follows.Proposition 3.12Given integersn≥d≥2, writen=kd+rwherek,r∈Zand0≤r<d. Then any d-part partition μ of n satisfiesμmin=(1,…,1︸d−1,n−d+1)≤μ≤(k,…,k︸d−r,k+1,…,k+1︸r)=μmax.Furthermore:1.dim⁡(Pn,dμmax)=(d+1)(n+1).μmin=μmaxif and only ifn=dorn=d+1.Ifn≥d+1, thendim⁡(Pn,dμmin)=d2+d+2nandPn,dμminhas codimension(d−1)(n−d−1)inPn,d=P¯n,dμmax.ProofThe formulas fordim⁡(Pn,dμmin)anddim⁡(Pn,dμmax)follow from Theorem 3.3. We omit the rest of the straightforward proof.  □Applied toP9,3, this proposition givesμmax=(3,3,3)andμmin=(1,1,7). Furthermore,P9,3(1,1,7)has dimension32+3+2⋅9=30, and its codimension inPn,d=P¯9,3(3,3,3)is(3−1)(9−3−1)=10, in agreement with Example 3.11.We will say more about the structure ofPn,dμminin Section 4.2.We can also allowa0,…,adto have a common factor. LetCPn,d⊆Rnd+1consist of all(a0,…,ad)∈Rnd+1such thata0,…,adare linearly independent. This hasPn,das an open subset and in addition contains those parametrizations where(a0,…,ad)have a nontrivial common factor. Recall from Proposition 3.1 that theμ-type of(a0,…,ad)∈CPn,dsatisfies|μ|=n−c, wheredeg⁡(gcd⁡(a0,…,ad))=c.Given a d-part partitionμwith|μ|≤n, we have theμ-stratumPn,dμ={(a0,…,ad)∈CPn,d|(a0,…,ad)has typeμ}.Since a d-part partition satisfies|μ|≥d, we will always assume thatd≤|μ|≤n. Note also that theμ-stratumPn,dμlies inPn,d(i.e., is one of the strata (3.3)) if and only if|μ|=n.Theorem 3.13Let μ be a d-part partition satisfyingd≤|μ|≤n. ThenPn,dμis a Zariski open subset of a subvariety ofRnd+1. Furthermore,Pn,dμis irreducible of dimensiondim⁡(Pn,dμ)=d|μ|+d+n+1−∑i>jmax⁡(0,μi−μj−1).We prove this in Appendix A using results from Iarrobino (1977, 2004). Here we give an intuitive argument to explain the formula fordim⁡(Pn,dμ). Multiplication gives a surjection(Rn−|μ|∖{0})×P|μ|,dμ⟶Pn,dμthat maps relatively prime d-tuples of degree|μ|to d-tuples of degree n with a common factor h of degreen−|μ|. The fibers of this map have dimension 1 since(λ−1h)(λb0,…,λbd)=h(b0,…,bn)for allλ∈k∖{0}and gcd's are well-defined only up to multiplication by a nonzero constant. By Theorem 3.3, it follows thatdim⁡(Pn,dμ)=(n−|μ|+1)+((d+1)(|μ|+1)−∑i>jmax⁡(0,ui−uj−1))−1.This easily reduces to the formula given in Theorem 3.13.We can also compute the Zariski closure ofPn,dμinCPn,d.Theorem 3.14The Zariski closure ofPn,dμinCPn,disP¯n,dμ=⋃μ′≤μPn,dμ′, where the union is over all d-part partitionsμ′withd≤|μ′|≤nandμ′≤μ.By definition,Pn,dμconsists of parametrizations with a common factor of degreen−|μ|. Theorem 3.14 tells us that inCPn,d, the differenceP¯n,dμ∖Pn,dμconsists of strataP¯n,dμ′, whereμ′≤μ. Sinceμ′≤μimplies thatn−|μ′|≥n−|μ|, we see thatP¯n,dμmay include strata with common factors of larger degree.Example 3.15In Example 3.10, we saw thatP6,3has a simple stratification with three strata. These and four other strata appear in the more complex stratification ofCP6,3:Here, we writeP6,3dim(μ1,μ2,μ3)as(μ1,μ2,μ3)dim, similar to Example 3.11.This diagram tells us that if we move around inP6,3(1,2,3)and reach its boundary inCP6,3, then with high probability we hit a point in eitherP6,3(1,2,2)(acquire a common factor) orP6,3(1,1,4)(remain relatively prime). These possibilities are not equally likely since the former has codimension 2 inP¯6,3(1,2,3)while the latter has codimension 3.In this section we investigate non-proper parametrizations and look more closely at the smallest and largest strata ofPn,d. Section 4.1 is new to this paper; Section 4.2 is a geometric interpretation of some results of Iarrobino (2004).In this section, we restrict our attention toμ-strataPn,dμwith|μ|=n, i.e.,μis a d-part partition of n. This means that all(a0,…,ad)∈Pn,dμare relatively prime. As in Section 3, we assumen≥d≥2.A parametrization(a0,…,ad):P1→Pdis proper if it is birational onto its image. In general, let k be number of points in the preimage of a generic point in the image. We say that the parametrization has generic degree k. It is well-known that if theai∈Rnare relatively prime, then(4.1)n=km,where k is the generic degree of the parametrization and m is the degree of the image curveC⊆Pd. Thus a proper parametrization has generic degree 1 and parametrizes a curve of degree n.Proposition 4.1Letk>1be an integer. ThenPn,dcontains a parametrization of generic degree k if and only ifk|nandn≥kd.ProofThe restrictionk|nis obvious from (4.1). To understand the inequalityn≥kd, recall our assumption that theaiare linearly independent, i.e., the image curve C does not lie in any hyperplane ofPd. But C has degreem=n/k, and ifm<d, then thed+1polynomials of degree m parametrizing C would have to be linearly dependent, forcing C to lie in a hyperplane. Thusn/k=m≥d. This proves one direction of the proposition; the proof of the other direction will be deferred until Appendix A.3.  □We next relate non-proper parametrizations to theμ-stratification ofPn,d.Proposition 4.2Suppose we have a μ-stratumPn,dμwithμ=(μ1,…,μd)and letk>1be an integer. ThenPn,dμcontains parametrizations of generic degree k if and only ifk|μifor all i.The proof will be given in Appendix A.3. Proposition 4.2 has the following useful corollary.Corollary 4.3Givenμ=(μ1,…,μd), the μ-stratumPn,dμconsists entirely of proper parametrizations if and only ifgcd⁡(μ1,…,μd)=1.Example 4.4Suppose thatn=12andd=3. The integersk>1dividing 12 arek=2,3,4,6,12. By Proposition 4.1,P12,3has no parametrizations of generic degreek=6or 12 sinced=3, whilek=2, 3 and 4 can occur.One can compute thatP12,3decomposes into12μ-strata, eight of which satisfy the gcd criterion of Corollary 4.3 and hence have no non-proper parametrizations. For the remaining fourμ-strata, we have non-proper parametrizations of the following types:•Generic degree 4 occurs inP12,3(4,4,4).Generic degree 3 occurs inP12,3(3,3,6).Generic degree 2 occurs inP12,3(4,4,4),P12,3(2,4,6), andP12,3(2,2,8).One expects non-proper parametrizations to be rare. Our next task is to quantify this intuition by computing the size of the generic degree k locus in eachμ-stratum. WhenPn,dμcontains a parametrization of generic degreek>1, Proposition 4.2 implies that itsμ-type can be written asμ=k(μ˜1,…,μ˜d), i.e.,μis divisible by k. This impliesk|nsincen=kμ˜1+⋯+kμ˜d.Theorem 4.5Assume that μ is divisible byk>1. Then the parametrizations inPn,dμof generic degree k form a nonempty constructible subset ofPn,dμwith irreducible Zariski closure of codimension(4.2)(k−1)(m(d+1)−S−2),S=∑i>jmax⁡(0,μ˜i−μ˜j),wherem=n/kandμ=k(μ˜1,…,μ˜d). Furthermore:1.The codimension is at least(k−1)(d(d−1)+2m−2)and is always positive.A generic parametrization inPn,dμis proper.The proof of this theorem will be given in Appendix A.3. Here is a sketch of some of the ideas involved. Using Lüroth's Theorem, we will show that a parametrizationF:P1→Pdof generic degree k is a compositionP1→GP1→HPd,where G is defined by(α(s,t),β(s,t))∈Rk×Rkof degree k and H is a parametrization inPm,dμ˜of generic degree 1 forμ˜=(μ˜1,…,μ˜d). It will follow that composition gives a mapφ:Pm,dμ˜×Rk×Rk⟶Pn,dμ(we have to shrink the domain slightly to make this work) whose image consists of parametrizations of generic degree k. The nonempty fibers of this map have dimension 4 coming from a natural action ofGL(2,k). Hence the generic degree k locus has dimensiondim⁡(Pm,dμ˜)+2(k+1)−4=(d+1)(m+1)−∑i>jmax⁡(0,μ˜i−μ˜j−1)+2(k−1),where we have used Theorem 3.3. The codimension formula in Theorem 4.5 follows by combining this with the corresponding formula fordim⁡(Pn,dμ). Full details will be provided in Appendix A.3.Example 4.6In Example 3.11, we saw that the maximumμ-stratum ofP9,3in the order of Definition 3.6 isP9,3(3,3,3)of dimension 40 and the minimum isP9,3(1,1,7)of dimension 20. The only non-proper parametrizations have generic degree 3 and lie inP9,3(3,3,3). Sinceμ˜=(1,1,1)andm=n/k=3in this case, Theorem 4.5 implies that the generic degree 3 locus has codimension(k−1)(m(d+1)−S−2)=(3−1)(3⋅(3+1)−0−2)=2⋅10=20inP9,3(3,3,3). Hence non-proper parametrizations really are rare! Note also that20=(3−1)(3(3−1)+2⋅3−2)=(k−1)(d(d−1)+2m−2)sincek=d=m=3. This shows that the lower bound in Theorem 4.5(1) is sharp.In Example 4.4 we noted that non-proper parametrizations with generic degreesk=4,3and 2 occur inP12,3. We give the respective codimensions using the formula (4.2) of Theorem 4.5:•Generic degree 4 occurs inP12,3(4,4,4), which has dimension 52. Here, we havem=3andS=0, so that the non-proper codimension is(4−1)(3⋅4−2)=30. In other words, the non-proper parametrizations have dimension 22.Generic degree 3 occurs inP12,3(3,3,6), which has dimension 48. Here,m=4andS=2so the non-proper codimension is(3−1)(4⋅4−2−2)=24. Hence the non-proper locus has dimension 24.Generic degree 2 occurs inP12,3(4,4,4),P12,3(2,4,6), andP12,3(2,2,8). A similar calculation gives respective non-proper codimensions 22, 18, and 18 inμ-strata of dimensions 52, 47, and 42. So these non-proper strata have dimensions 30, 29 and 24, respectively. Again, the non-proper loci have very high codimensions.In this section we describe a further stratification of the smallestμ-stratumμmin=(1,…,1,n−d+1)in the relatively prime case, assumingn≥d+1. The stratification will involve finding which rational normal scroll the curve lies on. We begin with an example.Example 4.8Rational curves inP3withμ=(1,1,n−2)were studied in Wang et al. (2009). Corollary 6.8 of that paper usesμ-bases to show that whenn≥4, such curves are either smooth or have a unique singular point of multiplicityn−2.This result can be explained using Section 2 of the paper Kustin et al. (2011), which considersμmin=(1,…,1,n−d+1)from a commutative algebra point of view. Whenμ=(1,1,n−2), the results of Kustin et al. (2011) imply that after a suitable change of coordinates inP3, the4×3matrix A from (3.1) can be assumed to be either(4.3)A=(s0r0t0r10sr20tr3),deg⁡(ri)=n−2,or(4.4)A=(s0r0tsr10tr200r3),deg⁡(ri)=n−2.(See Kustin et al., 2011, Prop. 2.1.) In either case, the first column of A gives the moving planesx0+tx1=0which contains the lineL1={(0,0,a,b)|(a,b)∈P1}. In the terminology of Wang et al. (2009), this is an axial moving plane withL1as axis. The second column of A also gives an axial moving plane with axisL2, the difference being that in (4.3), the axesL1andL2are disjoint (and the curve is smooth), while in (4.4), the axes meet at(0,0,0,1)(and the curve is singular at this point).Let us look at (4.3) more closely. Recall that the parametrization(a0,a1,a2,a3)is given by the signed maximal minors of A. If we seth1=sr3−tr2andh2=sr1−tr0, then one easily computes that(4.5)a0=th1,a1=−sh1,a2=−th2,a3=sh2.Note thath1andh2have degreen−1.A first consequence of (4.5) is thata0a3=a1a2, so that the curve lies on the smooth quadric surfacex0x3=x1x2inP3. We will see that this surface is a particularly simple example of a rational normal scroll. In terms of ideals, (4.5) implies thatI=〈a0,a1,a2,a3〉=〈th1,sh1,th2,sh2〉=〈h1,h2〉∩⨁m=n∞Rm.Here, recall thatR=k[s,t], so that the above equation tells us that I consists of all elements of degreem≥nin the simpler ideal〈h1,h2〉. In the terminology of Iarrobino (2004),〈h1,h2〉is the ancestor ideal of I.For (4.4), we have a similar situation. Let(a0,a1,a2,a3)be the parametrization coming from (4.4) and seth1=r3andh2=a3. Taking the first three maximal minors of A, we have(4.6)a0=t2h1,a1=−sth1,a2=s2h1,a3=h2.Hereh1has degreen−2andh2has degree n.From (4.6) we see thata0a2=a12, so that the curve lies on the singular quadric surfacex0x2=x12inP3. This surface is another example of a rational normal scroll. In terms of ideals, (4.6) implies thatI=〈a0,a1,a2,a3〉=〈t2h1,sth1,s2h1,h2〉=〈h1,h2〉∩⨁m=n∞Rm.Again,〈h1,h2〉is the ancestor ideal of I.This example shows that theμ-stratum for(1,1,n−2)decomposes into two parts corresponding to (4.3) and (4.4), each of which has a rational normal scroll and an ancestor ideal. There is some rich geometry and algebra going on here.In general, the ancestor ideal ofI=〈a0,…,ad〉⊆Ris the largest homogeneous ideal of R that equals I in degrees n and higher (remember thata0,…,ad∈Rn). Here is a result from Iarrobino (2004), whose proof we defer until Appendix A.4.Theorem 4.9LetI=〈a0,…,ad〉⊆Rhave μ-typeμmin=(1,…,1,n−d+1),n≥d+1. Then the ancestor ideal of I is equal to〈h1,h2〉, whereh1,h2are relatively prime and satisfyIn=Rn−deg⁡(h1)⋅h1⊕Rn−deg⁡(h2)⋅h2.SinceInhas vector space dimensiond+1, this theorem implies thatd+1=α1+α2,αi=n+1−deg⁡(hi)≥1.If we assumedeg⁡(h1)≥deg⁡(h2), thenα1≤α2, so that we have the partitionA=(α1,α2)ofd+1.This partition determines the rational normal scrollSα1−1,α2−1⊆Pd, which consists of the pointsλ(sα1−1,sα1−2t,…,tα1−1,0,…,0)+μ(0,…,0,sα2−1,sα1−2t,…,tα2−1)for all(s,t),(λ,μ)inP1. In this formula, the first expression in parentheses is the rational normal curve of degreeα1−1, sitting in the firstα1coordinates ofPd; the second expression in parentheses is the rational normal curve of degreeα2−1, sitting in the lastα2coordinates ofPd. Note how this usesα1+α2=d+1. These two rational normal curves are the “edges” of the scroll, which consists of lines parametrized by(λ,μ)that connect the points on the two edges with the same parameter value(s,t). It is well-known thatSα1−1,α2−1is a surface of degreed−1inPd(see Eisenbud and Harris, 1987).In our partition, we assume1≤α1≤α2. Whenα1=1, the “rational normal curve of degree 0” is just a point(1,0,…,0). Sinceα1+α2=d+1, we haveα2=d, so that the rational normal scrollSα1−1,α2−1=S0,d−1is just the cone over the rational normal curve of degreed−1sitting in the last d coordinates ofPd.To see how this scroll relates to the parametrization given byI=〈a0,…,ad〉, we use Theorem 4.9 to write the ideal asI=〈sα1−1h1,…,tα1−1h1,sα2−1h2,…,tα2−1h2〉.Switching to these generators of I corresponds to a coordinate change inPd. For(s,t)∈P1, the parametrization gives the point(4.7)h1(s,t)(sα1−1,…,tα1−1,0,…,0)+h2(s,t)(0,…,0,sα2−1,…,tα2−1),which is clearly onSα1−1,α2−1. Hence we have proved:Corollary 4.10LetI=〈a0,…,ad〉⊆Rhave μ-typeμmin=(1,…,1,n−d+1),n≥d+1. If the ancestor ideal of I gives the partitionA=(α1,α2)ofd+1, then after a change of coordinates inPd, the parametrized curve lies on the rational normal scrollSα1−1,α2−1.Example 4.11Whend=3andμmin=(1,1,n−2), the only two partitions of 4 are4=2+2=3+1. The corresponding rational normal scrolls areS1,1, defined byx0x3=x1x2, andS0,2, defined byx1x3=x22. Hence we recover (after a small change of coordinates) the two quadric surfaces encountered in Example 4.8.Finally, fix a partitionA=(α1,α2)ofd+1with1≤α1≤α2. Then definePn,d,Aμmin⊆Pn,dμminto be the subset consisting of all parametrizations in the stratum whose ancestor ideal gives the partitionA. Recall from Proposition 3.12 thatdim⁡(Pn,dμmin)=d2+d+nwhenn≥d+1. We defer the proof of the following result until Appendix A.4.Theorem 4.12The subsetsPn,d,Aμmin⊆Pn,dμminhave the following properties:1.Pn,d,Aμminis irreducible and is open in its Zariski closure inPn,dμmin.dim⁡(Pn,d,Aμmin)=d2+d+2n−max⁡(0,a2−a1−1).The Zariski closureP¯n,d,AμmininPn,dμminsatisfiesP¯n,d,Aμmin=⋃A′≤APn,d,A′μmin,where the union is over 2-part partitionsA′ofd+1.Example 4.13Continuing our study of(1,1,n−2)withn≥4, we have the partitions(1,3)≤(2,2). The larger partition(2,2)is generic and gives an open dense subset ofPn,3(1,1,n−2), of dimension2n+12. Parametrizations with the smaller partition(1,3)lie in a closed subset of codimension 1 sincemax⁡(0,3−1−1)=1.In the above example, recall from Wang et al. (2009, Cor. 6.8) that the curves corresponding to(2,2)are smooth while those for(1,3)have a unique singular point of multiplicityn−2. It would be interesting to study the singularities of curves inPn,d,Aμminin the general case whenμmin=(1,…,1,n−d+1).We conclude by noting that all ideals coming from parametrizations, not just those in the smallest stratum, have ancestor ideals that determine rational normal scrolls (possibly of high dimension) containing the curve. More precisely, suppose we haveI=〈a0,…,ad〉, wherea0,…,ad∈Rnare linearly independent and relatively prime. If I hasμ-typeμ=(μ1,…,μd), then we will see in Appendix A that the ancestor ideal of I can be written〈h1,…,hτ〉,where(4.8)τ=d+1−#{i|μi=1}and(4.9)In=Rn−deg⁡h1⋅h1⊕Rn−deg⁡h2⋅h2⊕⋯⊕Rn−deg⁡hτ⋅hτ.Note thatτ=2precisely whenμhasd−1indices withμi=1, i.e., whenμ=(1,…,1,n−d+1)andn≥d+1.The decomposition (4.9) ofIngives the partition(4.10)d+1=∑i=1ταi,αi=n+1−deg⁡hi.SettingA=(α1,…,ατ)determines a subsetPn,d,Aμ, which as we will see in Appendix A.4 has codimension and closure properties similar to those stated in Theorem 4.12.The partition (4.10) gives a rational normal scrollSα1−1,…,ατ−1⊆Pd. This is formed by putting τ rational normal curves inPdusing the firstα1coordinates for the first curve, the nextα2coordinates for the second, and so on. This works since theαipartitiond+1. As in the surface case considered earlier, the “rational normal curve” reduces to a point whenαi=1.The τ rational normal curves are the “edges” of the scroll. For a fixed parameter value(s,t), we get τ points, one on each of the τ curves. These points determine a subspace of dimensionτ−1. ThenSα1−1,…,ατ−1is the union of these subspaces as we vary(s,t)overP1.When(a0,…,ad)have no common factor, it is not hard to show that2≤τ≤min⁡{d+1,n+1−d}.Ifτ=d+1, it is easy to see that there is a unique partitionA=(1,…,1)andS0,…,0is justPd; and ifτ=d, then the unique partition isA=(1,…,1,2)and we again getPd. So the interesting cases are whenτ≤d−1. HereSα1−1,…,ατ−1has dimension τ, and one can show that its degree is(4.11)deg⁡(Sa1−1,…,aτ−1)=d+1−τ.See Eisenbud and Harris (1987) for more on rational normal scrolls.When I has ancestor ideal〈h1,…,hτ〉, (4.7) generalizes to show that the corresponding curve lies onSa1−1,…,aτ−1. By (4.8) and (4.11), the degree of the scroll equals#{i|μi=1}. Thus the number of 1's in theμ-type of the parametrization determines the dimension and degree of the scroll containing the curve. Note also that the interesting caseτ≤d−1occurs only when#{i|μi=1}≥2. InP3, these are theμ-types(1,1,n−2)considered in Examples 4.8, 4.11, and 4.13.Finally, we should mention that the rational normal scrolls discussed here are closely related to (but not the same as) the scrolls considered in Kustin et al. (2011). They studyμ=(1,...,1,n−d+1), soτ=2. In this case, our rational normal scroll is the surfaceSa1−1,a2−2⊆Pd. In Kustin et al. (2011), they work inPd+2with homogeneous coordinatesx0,…,xd,s,tand consider the three-dimensional scrollSa1−1,a2−2,1⊆Pd+2.
