@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we have presented a new and effective edge detection scheme based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classification in a contourlet Hidden Markov Tree Model (contourlet HMT). First, the input noisy image is decomposed into coarser and finer coefficients using a contourlet HMT transform to derive an efficient multiscale and multidirectional image representation. Second, the feature vector is performed through spatial regularity in a contourlet HMT domain, and the coarser coefficients classified using LS-SVM classifier into two classes: noise coefficients and edge coefficients. Next, all noisy contourlet HMT coefficients are well denoised by the BayesShrink method.Finally, the denoised coefficients and edge coefficients are fused using the weighted average rule, and the inverse contourlet HMT is applied to obtain the edge image.Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can attain improved performance over state-of-the-art edge detection approaches, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Tests were performed on several images from the Berkeley dataset corrupted with Gaussian noise and on other images such as a cameraman, pepper and medical images. The results illustrate that the performance of the proposed scheme is stable.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Edge detection techniques are significant and required in image processing and computer vision applications. They are applied to areas such as remote sensing or medicine and are used for protection of important structural properties, image segmentation, pattern recognition, etc. Traditional methods have been developed (Roberts, Prewitt, Sobel, Canny [2â€“4]) to obtain edge detection as presented in [1]. Major drawbacks of traditional methods include high sensitivity to noise and inability to discriminate edges versus textures.To decrease noise output, smoothing is applied with edge detection. However, isotropic smoothing reduces edge contrast, and some weak edges are still difficult to extract, which could result in poor localization of edges [5].In recent years, a number of sophisticated edge detection algorithms based on wavelet transform have been developed [6]; these algorithms can detect the local features of the signal at a dissimilar frequency, and can discriminate noise from edge information better than can conventional algorithms. However, they present some disadvantages when applied to natural images.Natural images have advanced characteristics and discontinuities along smooth curves. However, 2D separable wavelets are finely modified only to point-singularities, while wavelets are limited to directions. Consequently, extracted edges of an image are discontinuous and several directional edges cannot be detected.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: A review of previous related work is presented in Section 2. In Section 3, we briefly review the contourlet HMT and LS-SVM Classifier. In Section 4, we present the proposed edge detection scheme. In Section 5, we describe experiments using our scheme. Finally, in Section 6, we draw conclusions.
