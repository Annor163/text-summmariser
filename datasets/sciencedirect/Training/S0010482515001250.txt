Continuous Positive Airway Pressure treatment of premature infants; application of a computerized decision support system

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
A computerized decision support system could give estimations of blood gases of infants on CPAP.A computerized decision support system could accurately predict improvement in oxygenation by supplemental oxygen if the infant under CPAP therapy was hypoxemic.Computerized decision support systems can be used as helpful tools to analyze infants’ ventilation data.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The predictions of a computerized decision-support system (CDSS) are compared to clinical data obtained from a group of premature infants. The infants were suffering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and were treated by the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy. The predictions of the CDSS are found to be in general agreement with clinical measurements. The CDSS is also used to determine the effect of low level oxygen treatment on arterial oxygen pressure if the infant׳s oxygenation is low despite CPAP therapy. Based on the computational results, application of low levels of supplemental inspired fraction of oxygen (FIO2) would result in significant improvement in oxygenation of premature infants provided such treatment is carefully controlled to avoid hyperoxemia.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Neonatal respiratory care is an important area of critical care that is growing rapidly due to the increasing survival rate of premature infants. The most common complication among infants that are born prematurely is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The lungs of premature infants with RDS lack sufficient surfactant causing atelectasis and respiratory failure [1–5]. These infants are often treated with invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation during their first weeks of life. However, application of invasive mechanical ventilation can cause serious complications such as ventilator-induced pneumonia or bronchopulmonary dysplasia [6]. Therefore, application of non-invasive mechanical ventilation and in particular CPAP therapy for these infants has been steadily gaining more support and is gradually becoming the treatment of choice for this fragile patient group [7–10].At the same time, application of computerized decision-support systems (CDSS) in medicine has been the focus of significant research in the past few decades and is becoming more accepted as the amount of clinical data on patients increases and making decisions based on such data becomes more crucial [11–14]. One such system that could be tailored to the needs of premature infants was introduced in 2012 [15]. By using this system, the required infant data could be provided manually through a keyboard and the computerized system could be used to predict the outcomes of different invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation treatments and display the results to the clinician.The purpose of the present study was to perform a computer-aided analysis of ventilatory data on premature infants receiving CPAP treatment. One objective of this analysis was to assess the ability of the used CDSS in predicting the outcomes of the CPAP therapy. The measured data on a group of premature neonates on CPAP were input to the CDSS and the computational outcomes were compared to clinically measured data. The CDSS was further used to analyze and predict the outcome of low level supplemental oxygen treatment if the infant׳s oxygenation was low despite CPAP therapy. An overview of the system is provided and the results of the study are discussed in the sections that follow.
