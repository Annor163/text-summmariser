@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A novel robust method for surface tracking in range-image sequences is presented which combines a clustering method based on surface models with a particle-filter-based 2-D affine-motion estimator. Segmented regions obtained at previous time steps are used to create seed areas by comparing measured depth values with those obtained from surface-model fitting. The seed areas are further refined using a motion-probability region estimated by the particle-filter-based tracker through prediction of future states. This helps resolving ambiguities that arise when surfaces belonging to different objects are in physical contact with each other, for example during hand-object manipulations. Region growing allows recovering the complete segment area. The obtained segmented regions are then used to improve the predictions of the tracker for the next frame. The algorithm runs in quasi real-time and uses on-line learning, eliminating the need to have a priori knowledge about the surface being tracked. We apply the method to in-house depth videos acquired with both time-of-flight and structured-light sensors, demonstrating object tracking in real-world scenarios, and we compare the results with those of an ICP-based tracker.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Tracking the pose of objects in image sequences is one of the most fundamental tasks in computer vision [1], and many works in the past focused on tracking in grayscale and color images. Tracking in range images is less explored, but due to the availability of low-cost depth cameras and their increasing importance in science and industry, such tracking approaches are of growing interest to the machine-vision as well as the robotics community. For example, tracking of object surfaces based on range data can be used to monitor and control the actions of a robotic arm during object-manipulation tasks [2]. Using depth information as the primary information source has the advantage that objects can be directly described by their geometric form, which is not affected by changes in the object's appearance in terms of color and texture, lighting conditions, shadowing or reflections. Furthermore, geometric features required for grasping are immediately available. Disadvantages of using depth cameras are their limited resolution, accuracy, and operating range. This poses special demands regarding robustness and adaptability for the algorithms dealing with this type of data.Surface tracking in the domain of range image sequences has two main components: (i) extract the surfaces and establish the correspondence of the surfaces over the frames in the sequence of range images, and (ii) compute the motion transformation using these surface correspondences [3]. Both tasks are intertwined, as the correct extraction of surface patches helps finding correct correspondences, and vice versa. As long as surfaces are spatially disconnected, problem (i) can be more or less easily solved by clustering the 3D points based on their spatial proximity [2,4]. Problem (ii) can be solved by assuming 3D rigid-body motions between extracted point sets [3,5,6]. However, as soon as surfaces get in physical contact with each other, the problem becomes far more challenging, because in this case it is often impossible to distinguish between different objects based on depth differences alone. The situation becomes even more severe when both the manipulator and the manipulated surface undergo the same transformation at this time, e.g., during a hand-object manipulation. In this case, (i) and (ii) need to be solved conjointly, while taking the motion history of the objects into account.In this work, we offer a solution to this problem by combining a recent clustering approach based on surface-model fitting [2] with a particle-filter-based affine-motion-estimation approach [7] with some modifications. Because we use a split-and-merge procedure for region growing which automatically adapts to the dynamic range data, predictions from the particle filter can be incorporated in a straightforward manner by refining seeding and, in consequence, the input to the tracker.
