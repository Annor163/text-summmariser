@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) has been widely investigated to improve radiologists׳ diagnostic accuracy in detecting and characterizing lung disease, as well as to assist with the processing of increasingly sizable volumes of imaging. Lung segmentation is a requisite preprocessing step for most CAD schemes. This paper proposes a parameter-free lung segmentation algorithm with the aim of improving lung nodule detection accuracy, focusing on juxtapleural nodules. A bidirectional chain coding method combined with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to selectively smooth the lung border while minimizing the over-segmentation of adjacent regions. This automated method was tested on 233 computed tomography (CT) studies from the lung imaging database consortium (LIDC), representing 403 juxtapleural nodules. The approach obtained a 92.6% re-inclusion rate. Segmentation accuracy was further validated on 10 randomly selected CT series, finding a 0.3% average over-segmentation ratio and 2.4% under-segmentation rate when compared to manually segmented reference standards done by an expert.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Computed tomography (CT) is the de facto imaging modality used to diagnose and characterize pulmonary nodules. Compared to conventional chest radiography, CT generates high resolution, volumetric datasets that are able to resolve small and/or low-contrast nodules [1]. However, reading CT images can require the review of a large, often complex volumetric dataset, with the potential to overlook some nodules [4]. In addition, less experienced radiologists may have increased variability in detecting (subtle) lung cancers, as interpretation heavily relies on past experience. In response, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) [25,30–35] systems have been explored, establishing the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. Previous studies have shown that CAD increases lung nodule detection rates [44]; decreases false-positive rates [13]; and compensates for deficient reader performance in the detection of the smallest lesions and of nodules without vascular attachment [5]. Indeed, over the past two decades, the ability to accurately and consistently detect lung nodules has been an active area of research in medical image analysis [5,6,15,30–37,46]. The development of automated CAD for lung nodules is now further motivated by the imminent launch of lung cancer screening programs given the findings of the landmark national lung screening trial (NLST), which demonstrated a 20% mortality reduction for individuals with lung cancer who underwent screening using low-dose CT relative to plain chest radiography [2]. Based on this evidence, the United States preventive services task force (USPSTF) recently gave a Grade B recommendation that annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT be performed in adults aged 55–80 who have a 30 pack-year (number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years an individual has smoked) smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years [11]. The American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO) suggests similar guidelines [3].Lung segmentation is an important preprocessing step occurring before nodule detection and the generation of a region of interest (ROI) for subsequent analysis (i.e., the lung field). Pulmonary nodules can be grouped into three categories (Fig. 1): isolated, juxtapleural, and juxtavascular. Isolated and juxtavascular nodules lie within the center of the ROI and are typically segmented without issue. But when lung segmentation fails to correctly define the lung boundaries, juxtapleural (or pleura-connected) nodules can be missed, and normal chest tissue outside of the lung can be included incorrectly as part of the ROI. In point of fact, recent evaluation of a CAD system found that 17% of all true nodules are missed due to poor lung segmentation [7]. Accurate lung segmentation is thus imperative in ensuring accurate CAD system performance: the ability to identify true nodules ultimately sets the upper bound on CAD performance [6].In this paper, a novel method is proposed for delineating the lung field ROI by automatically segmenting the lung lobe, correcting the border to avoid excluding nodules close to the lung boundary while minimizing possible over-segmentation. The focus of this algorithm is to address issues related to juxtapleural nodules. A bidirectional chain encoding method is used to detect both vertical and horizontal critical point pairs. A support vector machine is then employed to predict whether the concave region formed by a point pair should be corrected based on positional information, concavity rate, and distance information. To test the proposed method, 233 CT scans from the Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset were used. This paper is divided as follows. Section 2 reviews previous related works, comparing and contrasting our proposed approach with earlier research. In Section 3, the methodology is presented in three steps: image preprocessing, inflection point detection, and border correction. Results of the evaluation are presented in Section 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 5 with a comparison to other works, discussion of the limitations of our method, and future work.
