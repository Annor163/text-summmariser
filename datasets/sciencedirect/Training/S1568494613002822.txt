@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper describes a nonparametric approach for analyzing gait and identifying bilateral heel-strike events in data from an inertial measurement unit worn on the waist. The approach automatically adapts to variations in gait of the subjects by including a classifier that continuously evolves as it “learns” aspects of each individual's gait profile. The novel data-driven approach is shown to be capable of adapting to different gait profiles without any need for supervision. The approach has several stages. First, cadence episode is detected using Hidden Markov Model. Second, discrete wavelet transforms are applied to extract peak features from accelerometers and gyroscopes. Third, the feature dimensionality is reduced using principal component analysis. Fourth, Rapid Centroid Estimation (RCE) is used to cluster the peaks into 3 classes: (a) left heel-strike, (b) right heel-strike, and (c) artifacts that belongs to neither (a) nor (b). Finally, a Bayes filter is used, which takes into account prior detections, model predictions, and step timings at time segments of interest. Experimental results involving 15 participants suggest that the system is capable of detecting bilateral heel-strikes with greater than 97% accuracy.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Gait analysis is beneficial for assessing treatment effectiveness, quality of mobility and general health [1,2]. Information about gait parameters can provide important diagnostic information relevant to balance, functional ability and risk of falls [1].The current methods for assessing gait parameters are mostly laboratory-based. They are expensive and not practical for application in daily life [3]. Force platforms, as the gold standard, can be used to precisely record the ground reaction forces exerted by the feet during the gait cycle [4]. Other popular methods use lower-limb sensors [5], pressure insoles [6], or stereo-photogrammetric cameras [7].An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) consists of accelerometers and gyroscopes to provide measurements of velocity, orientation and accelerations. IMUs are relatively low-cost devices, and can be used to generate data from which gait parameters can be extracted [1,3,8,2,9]. For example, waist-worn triaxial accelerometers were used by Moe-Nilssen and Tura to estimate gait regularity using an autocorrelation function (ACF) of the mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) accelerations [1,3]. Similarly, Bugane´extracted gait parameters by identifying heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO) events by performing peak detection and thresholding of AP and ML accelerations [8]. In addition, Köse used stationary wavelet transform and peak thresholding for detecting HS & TO events from data generated by waist-worn triaxial accelerometers attached to the right side of the ML axis [2].The above methods tend to perform poorly in real-world situations where the data is noisy, where gait patterns vary in real-time, and where there is a degree of drift in the placement of the sensors. Bugane´'s method, for example, requires the subject to stand still for a few seconds before starting and after stopping in order to ensure adequate “initialization” [8]. Köse's HS detection method uses a stationary wavelet transform with fixed thresholds that are finely tuned for each level of decomposition [2]. One of the limitations of the above methods is that artifacts that happen to have similar time-frequencies to those of gait events can be misclassified. Another limitation is that the methods are typically unable to detect lower magnitude HS and TO signals.A recent paper by Aung [9] proposed a method for extracting unilateral gait events using accelerometric features. The generalization approach used continuous wavelet transform, manifold embedding, and Bayesian inference. In contrast to [9], our approach seeks personalization rather than generalization. In addition, we also consider the contributions of gyroscopic sensors, movement artifacts, and variations in gait.We summarize the main contributions of this paper to three main points as follows:1A non-parametric approach for analyzing gait and identifying bilateral heel-strike events in data from an inertial measurement unit worn on the waist based on unsupervised learning approach is proposed. This proposed approach allows the device to evolve to be subject-specific as it learns the gait pattern of the wearer. To our understanding, this novel approach has not yet been proposed in the literatures.An effective feature extraction and high precision detection method based on the Markovian characteristics of the gait cycle have been designed. The proposed method exploits the features that best characterize bilateral HS events in both the accelerometric and gyroscopic signals.A comparative study is done using various features. Based on this study we see that the gyroscopic features are important measures for characterizing bilateral HS.The project was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration, and in accordance with the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) research guidelines and clearance granted by the UTS Human Research Ethics Committee. A long-term goal of the research is to develop improved gait-cycle-analysis techniques for our ambulatory monitoring systems [10–12]. This current paper reports our attempt in designing a minimally obtrusive gait analysis system using an inertial measurement unit (IMU).This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the proposed method. Section 3 presents the experimental settings, results and analysis. Section 4 concludes and suggests directions for future research.
