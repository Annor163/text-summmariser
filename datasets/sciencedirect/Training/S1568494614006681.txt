@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A combined MEMS Inertial Navigation System (INS) with GPS is used to provide position and velocity data of land vehicles. Data fusion of INS and GPS measurements are commonly achieved through a conventional Extended Kalman filter (EKF). Considering the required accurate model of system together with perfect knowledge of predefined error models, the performance of the EKF is decreased due to unmodeled nonlinearities and unknown bias uncertainties of MEMS inertial sensors. Universal knowledge based approximators comprising of neural networks and fuzzy logic methods are capable of approximating the nonlinearities and the uncertainties of practical systems. First, in this paper, a new fuzzy neural network (FNN) function approximator is used to model unknown nonlinear systems. Second, the process of design and real-time implementation of an adaptive fuzzy neuro-observer (AFNO) in integrated low-cost INS/GPS positioning systems is proposed. To assess the long time performance of the proposed AFNO method, wide range tests of a real INS/GPS with a car vehicle have been performed. The unbiased estimation results of the AFNO show the superiority of the proposed method compared with the classic EKF and the adaptive neuro-observer (ANO) including a pure artificial neural network (ANN) function approximator.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Based on low-cost MEMS sensors, an integrated INS with GPS is used to provide position and velocity data of land vehicles. Most applications of integrated MEMS INS/GPS technologies in land vehicles include automated car navigation, surveying, emergency assistance, person/asset tracking, collision avoidance, environment monitoring and automotive assistance [1]. Owing to the impressive advantages of low-cost MEMS devices including small size, light weight and low power consumption, MEMS grade inertial sensors are preferred particularly in positioning systems of land vehicles [2]. The output data of low-cost MEMS inertial sensors are affected by considerable uncertainties comprising of stochastic noises, short-term and long-term bias instabilities [3–5]. As the main and temperature varying uncertainty parameter, bias is the averaged output of sensor with respect to its zero input. Furthermore, the bias instability is due to unknown changes of the bias over sampling time. The bias uncertainty as the main error source leads to large errors of computed velocity and position components by the INS. Owing to the integration of accelerometers and gyroscopes’ output in an INS, the computational navigation errors significantly increase with respect to time. Therefore as a fixed error navigation system a GPS receiver is integrated with MEMS INS to eliminate the accumulated navigation errors to the uncertainties.Based on the linearized model of INS/GPS and the exact stochastic information, as the common state estimation algorithm of nonlinear systems, the EKF has been used for positioning of land vehicles [6–8]. However, the nonlinear dynamics and the considerable bias uncertainty of MEMS INS/GPS significantly decrease the estimation accuracy of the EKF [9]. Although, estimation and compensation of bias uncertainty using first order Markov and random walk process models may improve the estimation accuracy of the EKF [10–12]; the unknown and unmodeled uncertainties result in unbounded navigation errors. Furthermore, setting specific models for inertial sensors which can be suitable at all dynamical environments and can deal with the long term errors of sensor is commonly difficult [4]. Therefore for the purpose of INS/GPS integration, as an uncertain nonlinear system, developing computational techniques that are independent of sensor's uncertainty model is required.Observation and control of nonlinear uncertain systems based on neural networks have been investigated in online environments. In fact, neural network based observation and control methods take the advantage of neural networks in dealing with complex systems requiring no prior knowledge. Kim et al. have proposed an adaptive observer comprising of two separate linear-in-parameter neural networks for state estimation of an affine nonlinear SISO system with online training algorithms [13]. In the designed observed system though no preliminary knowledge of nonlinearities was required, Lyapunov stability of estimation errors has been obtained considering strong assumptions of strictly positive real (SPR) condition on the output error equation [13]. Neural network based observer for general MIMO nonlinear system with an open-loop structure was proposed using while the SPR assumption has been relaxed [14]. However, choosing proper values of design parameters including gains of the observer system was extremely difficult [14]. Using direct Lyapunov's method, a recurrent neural network observer of SISO nonlinear systems has been proposed under relaxed SPR assumptions [15]. Besides the relaxed assumptions imposed on the output error equation, an online training mechanism of neural networks using an adaptation rule was proposed. Abdollahi et al. proposed a neural network-based adaptive observer for a general model of MIMO nonlinear systems. Backpropagation algorithm with a modification term for increasing robustness has been utilized for online updating the weights. In addition, the SPR assumption imposed on the output error equation was relaxed [16].Knowledge based methods comprising of fuzzy set theories [17] and neural network methods are arisen from the desire of knowledge-based description of complex systems. Due to the adaptive behavior of neural networks methods and the capability of fuzzy logic in handling the uncertainties which occur in practical problems, complementary neural network and fuzzy methods are used as universal approximators of nonlinear systems [18–20]. Considering the capability of FNN in approximation of nonlinearities and uncertainties, FNN models have grown rapidly for both SISO and MIMO uncertain nonlinear systems with control and observation applications. An observer-based adaptive fuzzy control technique was developed by Wang et al. for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems under bounded external disturbances [20]. The state estimation was based on an adaptive fuzzy observer in which the uniformly ultimately boundedness of observation errors were obtained based on SPR condition for robotic application. Liu and Zhou have designed a FNN universal approximator of unknown nonlinearity in a nonlinear SISO system. The FNN has been utilized in the structure of an adaptive fuzzy neuro-observer with the purpose of designing an adaptive control system. As the authors claimed, the proposed online algorithm did compensate the dead-zone with unknown parameters [21].As the main purpose of this paper, without using SPR assumptions, a new online AFNO consisting of a FNN approximator is designed for data fusion of a low-cost MEMS INS/GPS. In the proposed AFNO, the raw measurements of inertial measurement unit (IMU) are input data of the online feed-forward FNN approximator of uncertain nonlinear terms of system. In the proposed FNN the weights of neural networks are considered as fuzzy variables. Owing to the robustness of fuzzy membership functions against uncertainties [22], using fuzzy weights in the neural networks model of the INS/GPS nonlinear system results in a robust AFNO against the large uncertainties of MEMS sensors. The fuzzy weights of the proposed FNN model have been computed through offline backpropagation training algorithm by Mahapatra et al. [23]. However, in this paper, the FNN's weights are adaptively adjusted through Lyapunov's direct method in which the stability of the AFNO is guaranteed. As a matter of fact, the nonmilitary GPS receivers update the position and velocity data at 1Hz which is very small with respect to 50Hz update rate of data of the inertial system. To decrease the time increasing errors of a low cost INS, using the GPS measurements, the weights of the FNN will be updated online at 1Hz. In the 1s gaps of GPS data, merely the inertial data of MEMS sensors are produced at 50Hz, therefore the last updated weights of the FNN are used to decrease the positioning data of pure inertial system.In order to implement the AFNO in the integrated MEMS INS/GPS, a MIMO nonlinear coordinate transformation method developed by Isidori [24] is used. The transformation method requires the existence of a diffeomorphism in which the nonlinear system will be transformed into a full-state linearized state space model. In an integrated INS/GPS, to estimate the state vector comprising of geographical latitude, longitude, altitude and also the velocity components in local level North-East-Down (NED), the aforementioned diffeomorphism does not exist. Therefore, the NED velocity components are replaced by the body velocity components of vehicle which yields a transformable model of INS/GPS to the full-state linearized model.The estimation performance of the designed AFNO is evaluated through road tests of a car vehicle. The MEMS-grade inertial sensors of low cost ADIS16407 IMU system together with a “Garmin 35” GPS receiver are used to generate the inertial data and the measurement data of the AFNO system, respectively. Furthermore, a 50Hz Vitans INS/GPS is used to produce accurate position and velocity data along the test path of the vehicle carrying both the reference Vitans system and ADIS16407 inertial system. The tests are executed in different maneuvering conditions of the vehicle in mountain roads, high speeds and wide changes of the heading angle to generate as much as possible extensive data. In this way, the low-cost ADIS16407 system is affected by considerable uncertainties owing to the large changes of heading angle, altitude and wide range dynamic maneuvers. To legitimize the assessment of the AFNO, the improved estimation results are compared with those of the EKF as the well-known standard navigation filter and also with the results of the ANO which uses a pure ANN instead of the FNN.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The proposed AFNO and the stability analysis are explained in Section 2. In Section 3, the strapdown INS is represented. Implementation of AFNO for MEMS INS/GPS is presented in Section 4. Real tests results of car vehicle and concluding remarks are presented in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.In this paper, the AFNO is designed for a class of MIMO nonlinear uncertain systems like INS which are generally represented by the following state space model.(1)x˙=f(x)+∑i=1mgi(x)(ui+δui)y=h(x)wherex∈ℝnis the state vector, f(·) and gi(·) are nonlinear and sufficiently smooth vector fields onℝn,u=(u1⋯um)T∈ℝmandδu=(δu1⋯δum)T∈ℝmstand for the known measured inputs vector by sensors and the unknown bias uncertainty vector of sensors, respectively.y=(y1⋯ym)T∈ℝmdenotes the measured output vector and h(·) is generally a nonlinear and sufficiently smooth vector field onℝn.Considering a well-defined relative degree, rjfor all the outputs, yjof system (1) withr=∑j=1mrj=nand the following full row rank characteristic matrix [24]:(2)ρ(x)=LgLfr−1h(x)there exists a diffeomorphism z=T(x) as:(3)z(i)=z1(i)z2(i)⋮zri(i)=hi(x)Lfhi(x)⋮Lfri−1hi(x),z=(z1z2⋯z2)TUsing (3), the system (1) is transformed into a new state space representation as:(4)z˙=Az+B[α(z)+β(z)(u+δu)]y=Cz(5)A=diag(A(1),⋯,A(m))T∈ℝn×n,B=diag(B(1),⋯,B(m))T∈ℝn×mC=diag(C(1),⋯,C(m))∈ℝm×nA(i)=010⋯0001⋯0⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮000⋯1000⋯0ri×ri,B(i)=00⋮01ri×1C(i)=(100⋯0)1×riwhere α(·) and β(·) are the nonlinear terms of new state vector, z. The intensity of uncertainties in a low-cost MEMS INS/GPS is affected by maneuvers and environmental conditions imposed by the carrying vehicle. Therefore, through considering the bias uncertainty term, δuas a function of states and known inputs, u the system dynamic (4) is represented as:(6)z˙Az+Bγ(z,u)y=CzNow, the new uncertainty term, γ(·) is considered to be approximated with a FNN and therefore, the observer is designed as:(7)zˆ˙=Azˆ+Bγˆ(zˆ,u)+K(y−yˆ)yˆ=Czˆwhere using the estimated state vectorzˆand u as input the FNN results in approximated uncertainty termγˆ(zˆ,u). The observer gain matrix, K is designed to keep a characteristic polynomial,A˜=A−KCHurwitz. Therefore, there exists, P=PT>0 as the solution of Lyapunov equationA˜TP+PA˜=−Qwith Q=QT>0 [18].Regarding, z=T(x) as a diffeomorphism, both the Jacobian matrix, ∂T/∂x and its inverse, (∂T/∂x)−1 exist [12]. Therefore, the estimation of the original state vector,xˆis obtained as:(8)xˆ˙=∂T∂x−1(Azˆ+Bγˆ(zˆ,u)+K(y−Czˆ))In this paper, the FNN approximation (Fig. 1) is designed as a multilayer feed-forward FNN with adjustable fuzzy weights, comprising of a crisp input layer (first layer), a hidden layer (second layer), a fuzzy output layer and a defuzzifier layer. A similar FNN has been used in adaptive filtering of noisy signals by Mahapatra et al. with offline backpropagation method for training of fuzzy weights [23]. As authors have shown, the FNN method could be used for both fuzzified input–outputs and non-fuzzy/crisp input–output data pairs. In the case of using the FNN for crisp input–output data pairs, input variables are not decomposed by fuzzy membership functions. In this paper, the aforementioned FNN is designed as a function approximator based on crisp input–output data set, in which the fuzzy weights are estimated online through adaption law instead of the backpropagation method. The adaptation law will be explained in Section 2.3. Unlike the common fuzzy neural networks used as universal approximators in preceding documented works such as [20,21], the input variables of AFNO are not decomposed by fuzzy membership function.The interval arithmetic method is used to compute the output of neurons in every layer. According to Fig. 1, the fuzzy output of the first layer is computed through multiplication of the crisp inputs and the first layer's fuzzy weights which are parameterized by α-cuts. Similarly, the fuzzy outputs of the first layer are multiplied by the fuzzy weights in the hidden layer which results in the fuzzy output of the FNN as α-cuts. Next, the crisp outputs of the FNN are obtained through defuzzification method.Using α-cuts, the ideal fuzzy weight matrices on the first and second layers of FNN are computed as follows:(9)M¯=∪αrα[Mlαr,Muαr]N¯=∪αrα[Nlαr,Nuαr]whereM¯andN¯are ideal fuzzy weights of the first and second layers of FNN, respectively.Mlαr,MuαrandNlαr,Nuαr, which are referred to the non-fuzzy weights at rth α-cut, αr, are obtained as [23]:(10)Mlαr=Ml1−αr2+Muαr2,Muαr=Mlαr2+Mu1−αr2Nlαr=Nl1−αr2+Nuαr2,Nuαr=Nlαr2+Nu1−αr2Based on the fuzzy output of the FNN approximator,o¯2with membership function, μf, the defuzzified output of FNN, o2 is computed as:(11)o2=defuzzifier(o¯2,μf(o2))o¯2=M¯T⋅σ(N¯Tμ)where σ(·) denotes a sigmoid activation function with a positive real bound, σm; andμ=(zˆT,uT)Tis the FNN's crisp input vector. Based on α-cuts, the output of the first and second layers of FNN are determined as follows [25]:(12)ojl1αr=σ∑k=0n1min(Njklαrμk,Njklαrμk,Njkuαrμk,Njkuαrμk)oju1αr=σ∑k=0n1max(Njklαrμk,Njklαrμk,Njkuαrμk,Njkuαrμk)(13)oil2αr=σ∑j=0n2min(Mijlαrojl1αr,Mijlαroju1αr,Mijuαrojl1αr,Mijuαroju1αr)oiu2αr=σ∑j=0n2max(Mijlαrojl1αr,Mijlαroju1αr,Mijuαrojl1αr,Mijuαroju1αr)whereojl1αr,oju1αrandoil1αr,oiu1αrare jth and ith outputs of the first layer and second layer at rth α-cut, αr, respectively.Mijlαr,Mijuαrstand for the ijth element of non-fuzzy weights,Mlαr,Muαr, which are associated with the jth node of second layer to ith node of fuzzy output layer; andNjklαr,Njkuαrdenote the jkth element of non-fuzzy weights,Nlαr,Nuαrwhich are associated with the kth node of first layer to jth node of second layer. n1 and n2 stand for the node numbers in the first and second layers of the FNN, respectively. Finally μkdenotes the kth element of crisp input vector, μ. Using center average defuzzifier and interval arithmetic method, the crisp output of the FNN (11) is obtained as [26]:(14)o2=∑rM¯T⋅σ(N¯Tμ)αrαr∑rαr=∑r[ol2αr+ou2αr]αrαr∑rαrTo simplify the stability analysis of the proposed observer (7), without loss of generality, using two α-cuts (α1=0 and α2=1) (14) yields to:(15)o2=McTσ(NcTμ)where Mcand Ncare corresponded to the non-fuzzy weights with α2=1. Based on triangular membership functions of fuzzy weights and considering, α1=0 and α2=1, Mcand Ncbased on (10) are computed as:(16)Mc=Ml+Mu2,Nc=Nl+Nu2Based on the FNN universal approximator, the following ideal approximation for γ(z, u) holds on a compact set z∈Ωzas:(17)γ(z,u)=defuzzifier((M¯T⋅σ(N¯Tμ)),μf(o¯))+ε(μ)where ɛ(μ) denotes the bounded approximation error, in other words, ||ɛ(μ)||≤ɛMwith some positive and real constant, ɛM.The fuzzy weights of the FNN are generally unknown and should be estimated whereas the stability of the observer is guaranteed. ConsideringM¯ˆandN¯ˆas corresponding estimations ofM¯andN¯, thusγˆ(zˆ,u)can be rewritten as:(18)γˆ(zˆ,u)=defuzzifier((M¯ˆT⋅σ(N¯ˆTμ)),μf(o¯ˆ))Considering (14), (18) is represented as:(19)γˆ(zˆ,u)=MˆcTσˆ(NˆcTμ)whereMˆcandNˆcare real matrices belonging to the compact setsΩMˆandΩNˆ, respectively.Defining the state and output estimation errors as,z˜=z−zˆandy˜=y−yˆthe error dynamics is obtained by subtracting (8) from (7) as:(20)z˜˙=A˜z˜+B[γ(z,u)−γˆ(zˆ,u)]y˜=Cz˜where(21)γ(z,u)−γˆ(zˆ,u)=McTσ(NcTμ)−MˆcTσˆ(NˆcTμˆ)+ε(μ)=M˜cTσ(NˆcTμˆ)+McT[σ(NcTμ)−σ(NˆcTμˆ)]+ε(μ)In which, the errors of estimated weights are considered as,M˜c=Mc−MˆcandN˜c=Nc−Nˆc.Since the sigmoid activation function, σ(·) the ideal fuzzy neural network weights and also the approximation error are bounded values, the termMcT[σ(NcTμ)−σ(NˆcTμˆ)]+ε(μ)of in (21) is bounded to some positive upper bound denoted by τ. Therefore, the error dynamics (20) leads to:(22)z˜˙=A˜z˜+B[M˜cTσ(NˆcTμˆ)+McT[σ(NcTμ)−σ(NˆcTμˆ)]+ε(μ)]y˜=Cz˜Assuming that z andzˆbelong to compact setsΩz={z∈ℝn|||z||≤R1}andΩzˆ={zˆ∈ℝn|||zˆ||≤R2}, respectively, the vectors=(z˜T,M˜cT,N˜cT)Twill belong toΩs={s|z∈Ωz,zˆ∈Ωzˆ,Mc∈ΩM,Mˆc∈ΩMˆ,Nc∈ΩN,Nˆc∈ΩNˆ}with MR={s|||s||≤R} the largest ball which could be included in Ωs.Theorem 1Consider the plant model(6)and the observer system(7)ofFig. 2with the following FNN's weight adaptation law:(23)M¯ˆ˙=−Fmσ(N¯ˆTμˆ)y˜T−Fm(k1||y˜T||+k2)M¯ˆN¯ˆ˙=−Fnsign(μˆ)y˜TM¯ˆTσ′(N¯ˆTμˆ)−Fn(k1||y˜T||+k2)N¯ˆwhere sign(·) is the sign function and,(24)σ′(NˆcTμˆ)=diag∂σi∂ni,n=NˆcTμˆMoreover,Fm=FmT>0,Fn=FnT>0and k1>0, k2>0.Then both the state estimation error and the FNN weight estimation error are ultimately bounded.The Adaptive law of fuzzy weights is designed based on Lyapunov's direct method whereas the state estimation error and the FNN weight estimation error are ultimately bounded. Using interval arithmetic method, the adaptation law ofMlαr,MuαrandNlαr,Nuαrat rth α-cut, αrare obtained as follows:(25)Mˆ˙lαr=−Fmσ((Nˆlαr)Tμˆ)y˜T−Fm(k1||y˜T||+k2)MˆlαrMˆ˙uαr=−Fmσ((Nˆuαr)Tμˆ)y˜T−Fm(k1||y˜T||+k2)MˆuαrNˆ˙lαr=−Fnsign(μˆ)y˜Tmin{(Mˆlαr)Tσ′((Nˆlαr)Tμˆ)(Mˆlαr)Tσ′((Nˆuαr)Tμˆ),(Mˆuαr)Tσ′((Nˆlαr)Tμˆ),(Mˆuαr)Tσ′((Nˆuαr)Tμˆ)}−Fn(k1||y˜T||+k2)NˆlαrNˆ˙uαr=−Fnsign(μˆ)y˜Tmax{(Mˆlαr)Tσ′((Nˆlαr)Tμˆ),(Mˆlαr)Tσ′((Nˆuαr)Tμˆ),(Mˆuαr)Tσ′((Nˆlαr)Tμˆ),(Mˆuαr)Tσ′((Nˆuαr)Tμˆ)}−Fn(k1||y˜T||+k2)NˆuαrThe adaptation law ofMˆcandNˆcconsidering two α-cuts (α1=0 and α2=1) of the triangular membership functions is obtained according to (25) as:(26)Mˆ˙c=−Fmσ(NˆcTμˆ)y˜T−Fm(k1||y˜T||+k2)MˆcNˆ˙c=−Fnsign(μˆ)y˜TMˆcTσ′(NˆcTμˆ)−Fn(k1||y˜T||+k2)NˆcConsider the following Lyapunov candidate, V(27)V=z˜TPz˜+tr[M˜cTFm−1M˜c]+tr[N˜cTFn−1N˜c]Taking the time derivative of V leads to:(28)V˙=z˜˙TPz˜˙+z˜˙TPz˜˙+2tr[M˜˙cTFm−1M˜c]+2tr[N˜˙cTFn−1N˜c]Replacing (21) in (27) and then applying the well-known Lyapunov equationA˜TP+PA˜=−Q, results in:(29)V˙=−z˜TQz˜+2z˜TPBM˜cTσ(NˆcTμˆ)+2z˜TPB[McT[σ(NcTμ)−σ(NˆcTμˆ)]+ε(μ)]+2tr[M˜cTσ(NˆcTμˆ)y˜T]+2tr[N˜cTsign(μˆ)y˜TMˆcTσ′(NˆcTμˆ)]+2tr[M˜cT(k1||y˜T||+k2)Mˆc]+2tr[N˜cT(k1||y˜T||+k2)Nˆc]By use of the following inequalities [16]:(30)tr(M˜cTMˆc)≤Mp||M˜c||F−||M˜c||F2tr(N˜cTNˆc)≤Np||N˜c||F−||N˜c||F2||Mˆc||F≤MP+||M˜c||Fthe time derivative of Lyapunov function (29) yields:(31)V˙≤−λmin(Q)||z˜||2+2||z˜||||PB||(||M˜c||Fσm+τ)+2||M˜c||Fσm||C||||z˜||+2||N˜c||F||sign(μˆ)||||C||||z˜||(Mp+||M˜||F)||σ′||+2(k1||C||||z˜||+k2)(Mp||M˜||F−||M˜||F2)+2(k1||C||||z˜||+k2)(Np||N˜||F−||N˜||F2)where λmin(Q) and ||·||Fstand for the minimum eigenvalue of Q and Ferobinius norm, respectively.

Therefore, the state estimation error and the FNN weight estimation error are ultimately bounded which completes the proof.Based on inertial measurements of 3-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes, a strapdown INS can provide navigation information comprising of position and velocity vectors of a vehicle in a predetermined reference coordinate frame. As shown in Fig. 3, the reference coordinate frames are considered as: (1) inertial frame, (2) Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) frame, (3) the North-East-Down (NED) local level frame, and (4) the body frame which has its origin at the center of the Inertial system.
