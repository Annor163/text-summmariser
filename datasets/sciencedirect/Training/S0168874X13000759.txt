@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We address in this paper an isogeometric finite element approach (IGA) in combination with the third-order deformation plate theory (TSDT) for thermal buckling analysis of functionally graded material (FGM) plates. TSDT accounts shear deformation effect without requiring any shear correction factors. The IGA utilizes non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) as basis functions, resulting in both exact geometric representation and high order approximations. It enables to achieve easily the smoothness with arbitrary continuous order. The present method hence fulfills the C1-requirement of TSDT model. The material properties of FGM plates are assumed to vary according to power law distribution of the volume fraction of constituents. The temperature field through the plate thickness is described by a polynomial series. The influences of length to thickness ratio, aspect ratio, boundary conditions and material property on the temperature critical buckling are investigated. Numerical results of circular and rectangular plates are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Functionally graded materials (FGMs) proposed by a group of scientists in Sendai-Japan [1,2] are often made of a ceramic at the top and a metal at the bottom as shown inFig. 1. Ceramic with the low thermal conductivity can resist high thermal environment while metal strongly supports mechanical load. Creating from these advantageous features of two above materials, FGMs have been using widely in many engineering structures corresponding to extremely high temperature environment such as aerospace, aircrafts, high-speed vehicles, nuclear plants, etc.Due to its wide application, many researches about functionally graded structures have been carried out. For instance, Noda and Tsuji [3,4] investigated the steady thermal stresses in a functionally graded plate. Zhang et al. [5] studied thermal stresses of FGM plates around a circular hole. Reddy et al. [6,7] studied the behavior of functionally graded microstructure-dependent beams. Thermal behavior of FGM plates with temperature-dependent properties was reported by Lee et al. [8]. Vel and Batra [9,10] provided an analytical solution for thermo-mechanical deformations of FGM plates. Reddy [11] presented the Navier's solutions of rectangular FGM plates that consider thermo mechanical coupling, time dependency and the von Karma-type geometric non-linearity, etc. Besides static and free vibration analysis, thermal buckling problem plays very important role in practical application. For example, in some thin-walled structures such as beams [12], plates [13–17] or shells [18,19], the temperature rise caused by heating or friction produces in-plane compressible forces which make the structures to be buckled before reaching to a yield stress. At the buckling state, the structure survives large deformation behavior and reduces load carrying capacity. This paper thus focuses on the study of the buckling phenomena of FGM plates under change of temperature.A theoretical framework of FGM plates is commonly relied on popular plate theories such as the Classical Plate Theory (CPT), First Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) and High Order Shear Deformation Theory (HSDT). The CPT ignoring the transverse shear deformation cannot produce accuracy results for thick plates [20,21]. The FSDT [22–24] takes into account the effects of shear deformation and can be applied for both thick and thin FGM plates. However, the accuracy of solutions will be strongly dependent on the shear correction factors in which their values are quite dispersed through each problem. Hence, the HSDT that include higher-order terms in the approximation of the displacement field have been developed, e.g. Reddy [25,26], Matsunaga [27] and Kant and Babu [28,29]. These models disregard shear correction factors and yield more accurate and stable solutions (e.g. inter-laminar stresses and displacements [26,30]) than the FSDT. It is worth mentioning that some HSDT models [26] requires C1-continuity of generalized displacements leading to the second-order derivative of the stiffness formulation and hence they cause some obstacles in standard finite formulations based on the C0-continuity. In this paper, we will show that a C1-HSDT formulation will be easily achieved using NURBS basis functions.Isogeometric approach, a new computational method, has been proposed by Hughes et al. [33] to closely link the gap between Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). It means that the IGA uses the same basis functions for both the geometry description and the finite approximation. Being different from basis functions of the standard finite element method based on Lagrange polynomial, IGA utilizes more general basis functions such as Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS) that are common in CAD geometry. The exact geometry is therefore, preserved at the coarsest level of discretization and the re-meshing is then performed on this level without any communication with CAD geometry. Furthermore, NURBS provide a flexible way to make refinement, de-refinement, and degree elevation [34]. They can produce easily the smoothness of arbitrary continuity order in comparison with the traditional FEM. Hence, IGA naturally verifies the C1-continuity of plates based on the HSDT assumption. IGA has been widely applied to a wide range of practical problems [35–43], and so on.We address in this article a simple and efficient formulation relied on the framework of NURBS-based IGA for thermal buckling analysis of FGM plates under various thermal distributions. The IGA utilizes NURBS as basis functions, resulting in both exact geometric representation and high order approximations. It enables to achieve easily the smoothness with arbitrary continuous order. Hence, the present method naturally fulfills the C1-requirement of HSDT model. We investigate critical temperature value versus various parameters such as length to thickness ratios, plate aspect ratios and properties of material. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present method.The paper is outlined as follows. Next section describes problem model for FGM plates. In Section 3, we introduce a novel plate formulation based on IGA and TSDT. The numerical results and discussions are given in Section 4. Section 5 closes with some concluding remarks.Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are often formed by two or more different materials which properties change continuously along certain dimensions of the structure. Therefore, the properties of FGMs are derived from a function of position through structural thickness based on the rule of mixture [11]:(1)P(z)=(Pc−Pm)Vc(z)+PmVc(z)=(12+zh)nwheren≥0is the power law index;Pc,Pmdenote the material properties of the ceramic and the metal at the top and bottom surfaces, respectively such as Young's modulus, thermal conductivity, Poisson's ratio, density, thermal expansion, etc.Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of Young's modulus through thickness of Al/ZrO2 FGM plate via the power index n. It is observed that as n=0, the plate is fully ceramic with highest material property and as n increases the effective property is non-linearly distributed with decrease of magnitude through thickness.In thermal analysis of the functionally graded plates, Tcand Tmdenote the temperature at the top and bottom surfaces, respectively. From the one-dimensional steady state heat conduction equation, the temperature field through the plate thickness can be expressed by a polynomial series [17]:(2)T(z)=Tm+r(Tc−Tm)∑i=0∞(rnikmcini+1)/∑i=0∞(kmcini+1)where(3)r=zh+0.5;kmc=km−kckmwithkis the thermal conductivity.The temperature distribution through the thickness of the FGM plate via various values of the power law index n is illustrated inFig. 3. It is evident that the temperature in the FGM plates distributes non-linearly and is always lower than that in the homogenous plates.Based on the TSDT [25], the displacement field of an arbitrary point in the plate is defined as:(4)u(x,y,z)=u0+zβx+cz3(βx+w0,x)v(x,y,z)=v0+zβy+cz3(βy+w0,y),w(x,y)=w0(−h2≤z≤h2)wherec=−4/3h2and the variablesu0={u0v0}T, w0 andβ={βxβy}Tshown inFig. 4 are the membrane displacements, the deflection of the mid-plane and the rotations in the x–z, y–z planes, respectively.The relationship between strains and displacements is described by [25](5)ε=[εxxεyyγxy]T=ε0+zκ1+z3κ2−εthγ=[γxzγyz]T=εs+z2κswhere(6)ε0=[u0,xv0,yu0,y+v0,x],κ1=[βx,xβy,yβx,y+βy,x],κ2=c[βx,x+w0,xxβy,y+w0,yyβx,y+βy,x+2w0,xy]εs=[βx+w0,xβy+w0,y],κs=3c[βx+w0,xβy+w0,y]and the thermal strain under temperature changeΔTis(7)εth=α(z)ΔT[110]Twithα(z)is the thermal coefficient of expansion derived from Eq. (1).The stresses are obtained from the constitutive relation as(8)σ=Qε,τ=Gγwhere the material matrices are given as(9)Q=E1−ν2[1ν0ν1000(1−ν)/2]G=E2(1+ν)[1001]with Poisson's ratioνand Young modulusEvary through thickness according to Eq. (1).The stress resultants are calculated by integrating the elementary stress couples through the thickness(10){NMP}=D¯{ε0κ1κ2}−{NthMthPth},{RT}=D¯s{εsκs}where(11)D¯=[ABEBDFEFH],D¯S=[ASBSBSDS]in which(12)(Aij,Bij,Dij,Eij,Fij,Hij)=∫−h/2h/2(1,z,z2,z3,z4,z6)Qijdz(Aijs,Bijs,Dijs)=∫−h/2h/2(1,z2,z4)Gijdzand the thermal stress resultants are expressed as(13){NthMthPth}=∫−h/2h/2Q{αxαyαxy}{1zz3}ΔTdzThe strain energy is written as follows(14)Uε=12∫Ω{ε0κ1κ2}TD¯{ε0κ1κ2}+{εsκs}TD¯S{εsκs}dΩ−∫Ω{ε0κ1κ2}T{NthMthPth}dΩIn this study, the plate subjected to thermal load is considered. Under temperature change, the in-plane resultant forcesN0=[NxNxyNxyNy]derived from Eq. (13) produce the work expressed as [44](15)V=12∫Ω[w,xw,y]N0[w,xw,y]TdΩHence, the total potential energy is given by(16)Π=Uε+VA knot vectorΞ={ξ1,ξ2,...,ξn+p+1}is a non-decreasing sequence of parameter valuesξi,i=1,...n+p. Whereξi∈ℝcalled ith knot lies in the parametric space, p is the order of the B-spline and n is number of basis functions which are needed to describe the B-spline. If the first and the last knots are repeated p+1 times, the knot vector is called open. A B-spline basis function is C∞continuity inside a knot span and Cp−1continuity at a single knot. If an interior knot value repeats one more time, it is called a multiple knot. At a knot of multiplicity k the continuity is Cp−k.The B-spline basis functions Ni,p(ξ ) are defined recursively on the corresponding knot vector start with order p=0 as follows(17)Ni,0(ξ)={1ifξi≤ξ<ξi+10otherwise}The basis functions are defined by the following recursion formulap≥1(18)Ni,p(ξ)=ξ−ξiξi+p−ξiNi,p−1(ξ)+ξi+p+1−ξξi+p+1−ξi+1Ni+1,p−1(ξ)It is found that for p=0 or 1 the basis functions of IGA are identical to those of standard piecewise constant and linear finite elements, respectively. However, they are different asp≥2. In this study, we consider the basis functions withp≥2.Fig. 5 illustrates a set of one-dimensional quadratic, cubic and quartic B-spline basis functions according to open uniform knot vectorsΞ={0,0,1,1},Ξ={0,0,0,1,1,1},Ξ={0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1},Ξ={0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1}, respectively. It is clear that the basis functions are Cp−1continuity. Thus, asp≥2, the present approach always satisfies C1-requirement in approximate formulations based on the third shear deformation plate theory proposed by Reddy [26].The B-spline curve is defined as(19)C(ξ)=∑i=1nNi,p(ξ)PiwherePiare the control points andNi,p(ξ)is the pth degree B-spline basis function defined on the open knot vector. For example, to construct a B-spline curve shown inFig. 6, two kinds of data need to be: the sequence of control points in red color and the knot vectorΞ={0,0,0,14,13,12,34,34,1,1,1}which is used to establish basis functions according to Eq. (18).The B-spline surfaces are defined by the tensor product of basis functions in two parametric dimensions ξ and η with two knot vectorsΞ={ξ1,ξ2,...,ξn+p+1}andΗ={η1,η2,...,ηm+q+1}are expressed as follows:(20)S(ξ,η)=∑i=1n∑j=1mNi,p(ξ)Mj,q(η)Pi,jwherePi,jis the bidirectional control net,Ni,p(ξ)andMj,q(η)are the B-spline basis functions defined on the knot vectors over anm×nnet of control pointsPi,j.Similarly notations used in finite elements, we identify the logical coordinates(i,j)of the B-spline surface with the traditional notation of a node I. Eq. (20) can be rewritten as(21)S(ξ,η)=∑I=1m×nNIb(ξ,η)PIwhereNib(ξ,η)=Ni,p(ξ)Mj,q(η)is the shape function associated with node I.To present exactly some curved geometry (e.g. circles, cylinders, spheres, etc.) non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) is used. Be different from B-spline, each control point of NURBS has additional value called an individual weightwIg. Then the NURBS surface can be expressed as(22)S(ξ,η)=∑I=1m×nNI(ξ,η)PIwithNI(ξ,η)=NIbwIgΣI=1m×nNIb(ξ,η)wIgIt notes that B-spline function is only the special case of the NURBS function when the individual weight of control points is constant. An exact cubic NURBS surface with its control points in red color is illustrated inFig. 7.In the IGA, the displacement field u is approximated by the NURBS basis functions(23)uh(ξ,η)=∑I=1m×nNI(ξ,η)qIwherem×nis the number of rational basis functions,NI(ξ,η)is given in Eq. (22) andqI=[u0Iv0Iw0IβxIβyI]Tis the vector of nodal degrees of freedom associated with the control point I.Substituting Eq. (23) into Eq. (6), the in-plane and shear strains can be rewritten as(24)[ε0Tκ1Tκ2TεsTκsT]T=∑I=1m×n[(BIm)T(BIb1)T(BIb2)T(BIs0)T(BIs1)T]TqIin which(25)BIm=[NI,x00000NI,y000NI,yNI,x000],BIb1=[000NI,x00000NI,y000NI,yNI,x]BIb2=c[00NI,xxNI,x000NI,yy0NI,y002NI,xyNI,yNI,x],BIs0=[00NI,xNI000NI,y0NI],BIs1=3c[00NI,xNI000NI,y0NI]It is observed thatBAb2contains the second-order derivative of the shape function. Hence, it requires C1-continuity in approximate formulations. It is worth mentioning that the construction of a C1 continuous finite element formulation having five-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) per node is more complicated and difficult. A C0 continuous element [30–32] with seven-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) was then proposed. However, the increasing of the computational cost and the accuracy of solution are still questionable. It is now interesting that our present formulation based on IGA satisfies naturally from the theoretical/mechanical viewpoint of FGM plates [37,38]. In our work, the basis functions are Cp−1continuity. Therefore, asp≥2, the present approach ensures C1-requirement in approximate formulations based on the TSDT [26].Substituting Eq. (24) into the minimization of total potential energy obtained from Eq.(16), the governing equation is defined as(26)δΠ=0⇔(K+λKg)q=λFthOn the LHS, the first term is the global stiffness matrix K and the second one is derived by multiplying the geometric stiffness matrix Kg due to the unit temperature difference with the thermal parameter λ:(27)K=∫Ω{BmBb1Bb2}T[ABEBDFEFH]{BmBb1Bb2}+{Bs0Bs1}T[AsBsBsDs]{Bs0Bs1}dΩ,Kg=∫Ω(Bg)TN0BgdΩin which(28)BIg=[00NI,x0000NI,y00]Note that the shear correction factor is no longer required in the stiffness matrix formulation.On the RHS, thermal load vector, which is considered as the thermal resultants, is computed by(29)Fth=∫Ω(Bm)TNth+(Bb1)TMth+(Bb2)TPthdΩThermal rise produces the stress resultants defined by Eq. (13) which makes the plates to be deformed. However, the isotropic plates under uniform temperature rise are capable to omit the force vector due to symmetry through plate thickness. Hence, Eq. (26) can be rewritten as(30)(K+λKg)q=0Another case, which enables to eliminate the thermal load vector, is clamped boundary type. It is worth noting that thermal loading can result in the additional thermal moment in the FGM plates. In general, that moment makes the FGM plate to be deflected because of asymmetrically mid–plane configuration. However, for some special case, that is clamped edges, the supports are capable to handle the produced thermal stress resultant [45–46]. Therefore, buckling bifurcation phenomenon may occur.In this section, a FGM plate made of Al/Al2O3 material as shown inTable 1 is considered. Thermal buckling parameters of the rectangular and circular FGM plates by uniform, linear and non-uniform temperature rise are studied. For circular plates, the exact geometry with conic section using isogeometric elements is also validated. Numerical results are obtained by quadratic, cubic and quartic elements using full p+1 Gauss points. In addition, we will prove that the present method can provide a flexible way for refinement and degree elevation. It results in the so-called novel k-refinement approach, which is uniquely derived from the IGA.Let consider the FGM circular plates with the radius to thickness ratio R/h=100 and power index n=1 illustrated inFig. 8a subjected to uniform temperature distribution. From the tensor productΞ×Hwith two knot vectorsΞ={0,0,0,1,1,1}andΗ={0,0,0,1,1,1}, the geometry of circular plate is described exactly in Fig. 8b with only one quadratic element corresponding to 9 control points which coordinate is given inTable 2. By repeating the first and the last values in knot vectors, the order of NURBS functions is increased. As a result, the geometry is described exactly with just one element but the control points in red color shown inFig. 9 increase according to increment of polynomial order. Then applying knot insertion technique, the geometric domain is divided into a sequence of refined meshes plotted inFig. 10. Note that Cp−1 continuity ensures at the boundaries of element. It is so-called k-refinement technique.Table 3 shows the convergence of critical temperature of the circular plate. Here we use quadratic, cubic and quartic elements according to order of NURBS function p=2, 3, 4, respectively. The convergence of the present elements is displayed inFig. 11. It is observed that the present results well converge to the analytical solution reported in [21]. Also, the NURBS approximation with the highest order (p=4) produce the most exactly solution.Fig. 12 shows that as order p increases the obtained solution converges very well to the actual value. It is concluded that the result is slightly softer than that of Ref. [21] as p is enough large. This is because the present method relies on HSDT while an analytical approach [21] used FSDT.In this sub-section, let consider the clamped FGM plate with meshing shown in Fig. 10c subjected to temperature rise.Tables 4 and 5 exhibit critical buckling temperatures according to uniform and non-uniform temperature distribution, respectively. The obtained results are compared with those of the analytical solutions [21] and the FEM [14] using a three-node shear flexible plate element based on the field-consistency principle. It is again observed that with the moderate thin plates the present results based on HSDT are lower that of FSDT and CPT models. As the plates become thinner, the buckling temperature parameter decreases rapidly and converges to that of the analytical approach [14,21].Figs. 13 and 14 describe the change of buckling temperature using the cubic NURBS element with respect to the thickness-to-radius ratios h/R and power indices n, respectively. It can be seen that with increase in h/R ratio (thicker plate), the plate can resist higher temperature and the difference between the critical temperature related to power index n is increased. With increase in n, the critical temperature values reduce because of the stiffness degradation by the enrichment of the metal material proportion. The change is rapid asn≤2and becomes slightly independent with power index asn>2, especially in case of uniform temperature distribution. Furthermore, it is revealed that under non-uniform distribution assumption, FGM plates gain higher buckling temperature than that using uniform temperature rise across the thickness.Fig. 15 depicted the ratio of critical temperature due to non-uniform and uniform temperature rise via power index. The ratio depending on material properties due to value n is always larger than 2.00 and gains the maximum at 2.638 with n=0.5. The mode shape of clamped FGM plate at the buckling state is shown inFig. 16.Let consider the thermal buckling of the square plate with its dimension: length a, width b and thickness h as shown inFig. 17a. The plate is discretized into uniform mesh of 15×15 quadratic, cubic and quartic elements, respectively, as shown in Fig. 17b–d. It is assumed that the FGM plate having initial stress free state at T0=0°C subjected to the temperatureTcat the top surface while the temperature at bottom surfaceTmis always equal to 5°C. The thermal critical value is then defined by thermal gradient through the plate thicknessΔTcr=Tc−Tm.We study behavior of the simply supported FGM plates under uniform temperature rise. For a comparison, the problem is solved using the eigenvalue approach according to Eq. (30) by neglecting the effect of bending moment. The critical thermal parameterTcrcorresponding to various exponent value n for both thin and thick plates is summarized inTable 6. As seen, the obtained solution matches very well with that of the analytical approach reported by Javaheri [20] and the semi-analytical method based on the HSDT proposed by Matsunaga [27].However, as shown in [13], FGM plates under simply supported constraint exhibit no bifurcation–type of instability except the homogeneous plates. This is due to the structural asymmetry through thickness. Hence, the governing equation in (26) needs to be solved with the existence of the load vector at the RHS.Fig. 18 shows the influence of the temperature field on the center displacement (w/h) of simply supported FGM plates. Considering effect of the geometric stiffness, the total structure stiffness reduces according to temperature increment. As seen, the plate becomes weaker with higher lateral displacement. As the gradient temperatureTcris enough large, the deflection increases rapidly with small change in temperature.Fig. 19 exhibits the upward deflection of the plate under the temperature effect.Next, the relation between critical temperature buckling ΔTcrand power index n under three types of thermal distribution for clamped FGM plates are investigated. As shown in [13], the clamped edge is neutralized the extension-bending coupling. It results in preventing the occurring of the initial transverse deformation under temperature field [47]. Hence, the buckling bifurcation type is exhibited. InFig. 20, it can be seen that for the homogeneous plates, the non-uniform thermal distribution becomes the linear form. The results obtained from two cases are therefore coincided. Moreover, the same conclusions for the circular plates in previous sub-section are repeated for the rectangular plates such as:ΔTcrreduces according to increase in power index n or length to thickness ratio a/h; the critical gradientΔTcrby nonlinear distribution is higher than that of linear form or uniform form.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, a simple and efficient plate formulation using NURBS-based IGA and the TSDT has been proposed for thermal buckling analysis of FGM plates. The present method provides a flexible way to make refinement and degree elevation. It enables to achieve easily the smoothness with arbitrary continuous order compared with the traditional FEM. As a result, the present NURBS formulation naturally fulfills the C1-continuity of HSDT plates. The results of the present method are in good agreement with available solutions in the literature. Through tested examples, some additional discussions can be drawn as:•The proposed model is not only capable of exactly describing the plate geometry but also accurately predicting the behavior of the plate.As NURBS order increases, the global stiffness matrix becomes softer. Thus, the obtained results are faster convergent to the analytical solutions.With the same problems, the HSDT model gives the lowest critical temperatures while the CPT gives the highest ones. As the plates become thinner, the present solutions converge to that of the FSDT and CPT models.The buckling thermal value of FGM plates decreases corresponding to the increase in the length-to- thickness ratio.The buckling critical temperature obtains maximum in fully ceramic plates and decreases according to the increase in the power index n because of the material degradation by enrichment of metal constituent.The critical thermal gradientΔTcrof the FGM plates under nonlinear temperature distribution is greater than that under uniform or linear one.
