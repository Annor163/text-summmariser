@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes an integer linear programming formulation for a simultaneous lot sizing and scheduling problem in a job shop environment. Among others, one of our realistic assumptions is dealing with flexible machines which enable the production manager to change their working speeds. Then, a number of valid inequalities are developed based on problem structures. As the valid inequalities can help in reducing the non-optimal parts of the solution space, they are dealt with as some cutting planes. The proposed cutting planes are used to solve the problem in (i) cut-and-branch, and (ii) branch-and-cut approaches. The performance of each cutting plane is investigated with CPLEX 12.2 on a set of randomly-generated test data. Then, some performance criteria are identified and the proposed cutting planes are ranked by TOPSIS method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Production management is a multi-disciplinary job that involves in considering many factors simultaneously. Among other tasks, a production manager should simultaneously decide about lot sizing and process routing of some items in each planning period to minimize total cost of the plant. Furthermore, there is limited amount of available working time due to technical limitations in a planning period. And, dealing with such technical limitations results in a complicated problem that was mainly treated by heuristics and rule of thumbs (Fallah & Shayan, 2002). Also, these decisions (i.e. lot sizing and machine sequencing) were traditionally made in a sequential manner, resulting in a number of recursive corrective actions. In more details, the following steps were generally taken in traditional (i.e. MRP-based) production management with some minor variations (Koh, Saad, & Jones, 2002; Pochet & Wolsey, 2006; Waters, 2003):Step 0:estimate the available capacity for processing a set of items over needed machines in the following periods,determine lot sizes of different items for forthcoming planning periods,determine the best schedule of machineries to perform different processes of each item, regarding their lot sizes,check if the obtained production schedule is feasible in term of needed capacities;if the production schedule is not feasible, thenrevise the decisions by some heuristics,otherwiseperform a local search to find better solutions for a number of trials.Moreover, these decisions are usually updated via a rolling horizon framework with the hope of cost reduction by means of special-purpose packages or heuristics (Karimi, Fatemi Ghomi, & Wilson, 2003). Consequently, there are many critiques on the non-optimality of the above procedure due to non-simultaneousness of decision makings (Franck, Neumann, & Schwindt, 1997). On the other hand, machines can work in different rates/modes by changing their settings. This feature is ordinarily observed in lots of real world shop floors and provides a degree of flexibility for a production manager, but it may also complicate determining the optimal policy. So, if we decide about lot sizes and process sequences simultaneously while considering shop constraints, then we can be sure about the efficiency and/or optimality of the whole production schedule (i.e. lot sizes and machine sequences in periods). However, this may lead to mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations that are hard to solve in reasonable time for sizes close to real world (Pochet & Wolsey, 2006). This paper tries to fill in the gap by providing a problem formulation along with a set of efficient valid inequalities.
