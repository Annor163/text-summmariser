@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study investigated the effects of ambient illumination conditions (illumination color and illumination intensity) and background color on visual performance (character identification and reading comprehension) with TFT-LCD screens.Results of Experiment 1 indicated that all the three independent variables had significant effects on mean percentage of character identification. Mean character identification performance was best under white light, 500 lux, and blue background. In general, the backgrounds with primary colors had better mean character identification performance than the middle-point colors and gray. Results of Experiment 2 indicated that the illumination intensity and background color had significant effects on mean text comprehension performance for reading comprehension. Mean text comprehension performance were higher under 500 lux and blue background. The backgrounds with primary colors had better mean correct answers than the gray background. According to the results, white light, normal ambient illumination and a background with primal colors seemed to be the optimal conditions. If the yellow ambient light is necessary, using blue as the TFT-LCD background color of will provide better performance.The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient indicated that short-term visual task measurement might be suitable to evaluate the visual performance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Thin film transistor liquid-crystal displays (TFT-LCD) with light emitting diode (LED) or cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting are now becoming the optimal choice for visual display terminals (VDT) due to their low power consumption, rapid price reduction, improved optical characteristics and large variety of display size.Ambient illumination conditions (illumination color and illumination intensity) significantly affect human psychological responses, such as visual performance [1,2], color discrimination [3,4] and visual workload [5]. To support the various purposes of a workplace, the illumination colors of fluorescent lamps may vary; for instance, white light in used for general offices and yellow light for the etching process in photo areas of semi-conductor factories. Lin et al. [5] reported that both visual acuity and subjective visual fatigue were significantly affected by the color of light. But there are insufficient studies on the effects of illumination color on visual performance.Illumination intensity is an important consideration in TFT-LCD workstation design. In addition to the effects of illumination intensity on screen luminance, the surface-reflected light also affects the chromaticity coordinates of colors [3]. Furthermore, under usual ambient illumination conditions for working with a TFT-LCD (notebook computer screen), illumination intensity can vary greatly, e.g., in an office or outdoors. Thus, there is a need to further examine the effects of illumination intensity on visual performance using TFT-LCD.Chromaticity contrast (background color) is an important subfactor of color combination and can be an effective way of improving human–computer communication [1,6–8]. Though chromaticity contrast can improve visual performance, some color combinations may cause added visual problems due to chromatic aberration [9]. Further, Buchner and Baumgartner [10] showed that chromaticity contrast could not compensate for a lack of luminance contrast, and luminance contrast of the screen is the most important subfactor of color combination [1] that significantly affects visual performance [1,6,11–16]. Generally, a higher luminance contrast results in better visual performance, but in order to reduce power consumption, the ratio of 8:1 might be the optimal choice of luminance contrast [1,11].Polarity is another subfactor of color combination that may affect visual performance. Positive polarity is the most commonly used polarity many software programs, and most research has indicated that positive polarity produces better visual performance than negative polarity [10,17–19]. But most previous studies have confounded the effects of luminance contrast with those of chromaticity contrast and polarity. Therefore, the present study uses positive polarity and a luminance contrast of 8:1 to examine the effects of chromaticity contrast on TFT-LCD screens.In summary, there is a lack of studies concerning the effects of ambient illumination conditions (illumination color and illumination intensity) and background color both for short-term visual task (character identification) and for long-term visual task (reading comprehension) with TFT-LCD are rare. Therefore, it is important to empirically evaluate the effects of ambient illumination conditions and background color on visual performance when using TFT-LCD.
