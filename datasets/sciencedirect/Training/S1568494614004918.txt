@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The present work addresses the problem of missing data in multidimensional time series such as those collected during operational transients in industrial plants. We propose a novel method for missing data reconstruction based on three main steps: (1) computing a fuzzy similarity measure between a segment of the time series containing the missing data and segments of reference time series; (2) assigning a weight to each reference segment; (3) reconstructing the missing values as a weighted average of the reference segments. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of an Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) method on an artificial case study and a real industrial application regarding shut-down transients of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) turbine.number of reference trajectoriesindex of the reference trajectoriesnumber of dimensions of a trajectoryindex of the signalm-th reference trajectorytime length of a reference trajectorytime indexvalue of signal j of trajectory m at time ktest trajectorysignal with missing datalength of the time window with missing datapresent time in the test trajectoryvalue of signal j at time k≤t in the test trajectoryreconstruction of a missing datumtime length used for the similarity computationsegment of the most recent Ltmeasurements of signal j in the test trajectorysegment of length Ltof signal j which ends at time k in reference trajectory msquared Euclidean distance between the monodimensional segmentx¯mtr(k,j)andx¯t(j)squared Euclidean distance betweenX¯¯and the k-th segment of the m-th reference trajectorymembership function value of the “approximately zero” fuzzy set computed inδm2(k)parameter of μm(k)parameter of μm(k)distance score betweenX¯¯and the k-th segment of the m-th reference trajectoryweight given to the k-th segment of the m-th reference trajectory

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The problem of missing data afflicts a variety of application areas in fields such as engineering, economics and finance. The datasets available to build models are often characterized by missing values, due to various causes such as sensor faults, problems of not reacting experiments, not recovering work situations, transferring data to digital systems [1]. Missing data can lead to problems during model development.In this work, we consider the problem of missing data in the context of on-line condition monitoring of industrial components by empirical, data-driven models [2,3]. On-line condition monitoring aims at informing on the health state of industrial components. When using empirical models, the condition monitoring performance is highly dependent on the availability and quality of the measurements used to establish (train) the model [4]. Furthermore, during the use of condition monitoring models, if, for example, a sensor fails to provide an input value, the condition monitoring model may not be capable of inferring the health state of the component. Therefore, it is important to restore the missing sensor readings to provide a set of complete input data to the condition monitoring model, for its training and during its use.Three different approaches to the missing data problem are typically proposed. The first consists in removing from the dataset all the patterns with a missing datum in at least one signal [5]. The main drawback of such approach is the loss of valuable information that may be contained in the discharged signal measurements [6]. The effect of this is particularly relevant when the dataset is small. The second approach consists in substituting the missing data by statistical values, e.g. the mean value of the available historical data [7]. The goodness of the substituting values depends on how close they actually are on the true (unknown) values [8]. Finally, the third approach consists in developing model to reconstruct the missing values based on the relationships between the signals [5]. In this context, empirical, auto-associative, modelling techniques such as Auto-Associative Artificial Neural Networks (AANN) [9], Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [10,11] and Auto-Associative Kernel Regression Methods (AAKR) [12,13] have been applied with success to the reconstruction of missing data. AANN have been shown to work well for reconstruction, although they may require high computational costs in large multidimensional problems [14]. PCA and AAKR methods are “leaner” and, thus, more suitable for application to missing data reconstruction in large datasets, due to their lower computational burden. Other more complex approaches applied to the reconstruction of missing data are based on the use of similarity measures computed taking into account the correlation [15] and entropy [16] between the data. However, the performance of these techniques, which has been proven to be very satisfactory in non time dependent problems such as those encountered in genes expression data, tends to decrease when they are applied to datasets containing non-stationary, time-varying and nonlinear signal behaviours [17].In this work, we address the problem of missing data in multidimensional time series, e.g. process signals monitored during turbine start-up transients in nuclear power plants or daily flow values of some rivers in a drainage basin. We assume to have available several examples of the time series, e.g. collection of the signal values measured during several, different turbine start-up transients or the daily measurements of the river flows during different years. A difficulty comes from the fact that the reconstruction of a datum missing at a given time does not depend only from the values of the other signals at that time, but also from previous values on the time series.In this paper, we present a missing data reconstruction method that we have developed based on a Fuzzy Similarity (FS) method [18]. A measure of similarity is computed between a set of reference multidimensional time-series segments of given length and the multidimensional segment containing the missing data; then, the missing values are reconstructed as average of the reference segments weighted by the similarity with the segment containing the missing data.The method is tested on two case studies: a simulated four-dimensional time series and 27 signals measured during shut-down transients of nuclear power plants (NPP) steam turbines. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of an AAKR method of literature [19].The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the problem that we want to address; Section 3 describes the proposed FS-based method and discusses the metrics that are used to evaluate the missing data reconstruction performance; Sections 4 and 5 illustrate the application of the method to the artificial case study and to the industrial case study, respectively; finally, Section 6 draws the conclusion of the work.We consider a training dataset containing M different J-dimensional realizations of a time series, hereafter called trajectories, and indicated byX¯¯mtr,m=1,…,M. These reference trajectories are all complete, i.e. they do not suffer of any missing data. For simplicity of illustration, all the reference trajectories are assumed to have the same time length T. The generic elementxmtr(k,j)ofX¯¯mtrindicates the value of signal j of trajectory m at time k.The objective of this work is the reconstruction of missing data in a (test) trajectory,X¯¯, that we are measuring. The length ofX¯¯can be shorter than T. We consider that the values of only one signal, hereafter referred to as jmiss, are missing in a single time window from time t–φ until the present time t. The generic element of the test trajectory, x(k, j), indicates the value of signal j at time k≤t. The obtained reconstruction of a missing datum of signal jmiss will be indicated byxˆ(k,jmiss),t−φ≤k≤t.The proposed method for missing data reconstruction is based on three main steps:(1)compute a measure of fuzzy similarity between multidimensional segments of the reference trajectories in a time window of length Ltand the most recent segment of length Ltof the test trajectory containing the missing datum;assign a weight to each reference segment; the weight is chosen proportional to the similarity of the reference segments to the test trajectory;reconstruct the missing datum as a weighted average of the reference segments.At the present time t, the segment of test trajectory containing only the most recent Ltmeasurements of signal j is denoted asx¯t(j)=[x(t−Lt+1,j);x(t−Lt+2,j),…,x(t,j)]and the generic segment of length Ltof signal j in reference trajectory m which ends at time k is denoted asx¯mtr(k,j)=x¯mtr(k−Lt+1:k,j).With respect to the time window length, Lt, two situations may arise:CASE A: it is longer than the time duration of the missing data segment, i.e. Lt>φ; in this case, the values [x(t−Lt+1, jmiss), …, x(t−φ−1, jmiss)] are available and only the values in [x(t−φt, jmiss), …, x(t, jmiss)] are missing;CASE B: it is equal or shorter than the time duration of the missing data segment, i.e. Lt≤φ; in this case, all the values ofx¯t(jmiss)=[x(t−Lt+1,jmiss);x(t−Lt+2,jmiss),…,x(t,jmiss)]are missing.For example, Figs. 1 and 2show the evolution of 4 signals in a time series in a case in which we are unable to measure signal jmiss=1 from time t=21. To perform the reconstruction of the missing values, we consider a time window of length Lt=5. Thus, at time t=21 (Fig. 1), only φ=1 measurements are missing for signal jmiss (case A), whereas as time passes, the number of missing measurements increases until, at time t=26, we reach the situation of case B where φ=Lt.For ease of explanation, the case of missing values in a single signal is treated, but generalization to a multi-dimensional problem is straightforward.The signal reconstruction method is based on the following steps:Step 1: trajectory pointwise difference computationIn this step, we compute the squared Euclidean distance difference between the segment of the test trajectory containing the missing data and the segments obtained from the reference trajectories.In CASE A, characterized by φ<Lt, the squared Euclidean distance is computed taking into account all the available Ltmeasurements for the signals j≠jmiss without missing data in the test trajectory and only the Lt–φ available measurements for signal jmiss. In practice, the test segmentsx¯t(j)of the test trajectoryX¯¯at time instant t and the k-th segment of the m-th reference trajectory are:(1)x¯t(j)=[x(t−Lt+1,j);x(t−Lt+2,j);…;x(t−φ,j)]ifj=jmissx¯t(j)=[x(t−Lt+1,j);x(t−Lt+2,j);…;x(t,j)]ifj≠jmiss(2)x¯mtr(k,j)=[xmtr(k−Lt+1,j);xmtr(k−Lt+2,j);…;xmtr(k−φ,j)]ifj=jmissx¯mtr(k,j)=[xmtr(k−Lt+1,j);xmtr(k−Lt+2,j);…;xmtr(k,j)]ifj≠jmissThe squared Euclidean distance between the Ltelements of the k-th segment of the m-th reference trajectoryx¯mtr(k,j)and the elements of the test time segmentx¯t(j)of the j-th signal, is given by:(3)δm2(k,j)=|x¯mtr(k,j)−x¯t(j)|2The distance is finally reduced to [20]:(4)δm2(k)=∑j=1Jδm2(k,j)JIn CASE B), characterized by all missing values of signal jmiss in Lt, i.e. φ≥Lt, only the remaining signals j≠jmiss are considered for the computation of the squared Euclidean distance. In practice, the test segmentsx¯t(j)of the test trajectoryX¯¯and the k-th segment of the m-th reference trajectory, are:(5)x¯t(j)=[x(t−Lt+1,j);x(t−Lt+2,j);…;x(t,j)]x¯mtr(k,j)=[xmtr(k−Lt+1,j);xmtr(k−Lt+2,j);…;xmtr(k,j)]j≠jmissThe squared Euclidean distanceδm2(k,j)between the Ltcomponents of the k-th time segment of the m-th reference trajectoryx¯mtr(k,j)and the Ltmeasurements of the test time segmentx¯t(j)of the j-th signal, j≠jmiss, is calculated as in Eq. (3).The distance is finally divided by the number of signals without missing values J−1:(6)δm2(k)=∑j=1J−1δm2(k,j)J−1Step 2: trajectory pointwise similarity and distance score computationTo account for a gradual transition between ‘similar’ and ‘non-similar’ we introduce an “approximately zero” fuzzy set [21] taken, in this work, as a bell-shaped function, whose membership function value computed inδm2(k)is equal to:(7)μm(k)=e−((−(ln(α)/β2)δm2(k))The parameters α and β are set by the analyst: the larger the value of the ratio ln(α)/β2, the narrower the fuzzy set and the stronger the definition of similarity [18].The distance score dm(k) between two segments is, then, computed as:(8)dm(k)=1−μm(k)k=Lt,…,T,m=1,…,MStep 3: weights computationThe basic idea behind the weighted reconstruction is that all the reference training trajectories carry useful information for the reconstruction of the missing data in the currently developing trajectory [18]. To this aim, weights are computed with a decreasing monotone function [18], such that the smaller the distance dm(k) the larger the weight given to the k-th segment of the m-th reference trajectory:(9)wm(k)=(1−dm(k))e−(1/β)dm(k)k=Lt,…,T,m=1,…,MThe same value of β used in Eq. (7) is here employed in order to reduce the number of parameters to be set.Step 4: missing values reconstructionThe reconstruction of the missing datum,xˆ(t,jmiss), in the test trajectory is the weighted sum of the last elementsxmtr(k,jmiss)of the reference training segments [19]:(10)xˆ(t,jmiss)=∑m=1M∑k=LtTwm(k)xmtr(k,jmiss)∑m=1M∑k=LtTwm(k)We have considered an artificial case study built by simulating M=114 trajectories of length T=100 time steps (in arbitrary units) in a J=4 dimensional signal space, whose projections into the 4-dimensional space are plotted in Figs. 3–6. The trajectories are simulated by choosing for each signal one of the three following functional behaviours:(11)xj=2α1a1+erf(t−e)−u2+10−3ω(12)xj=α2(cd(t−e)−c)+10−3ω(13)xj=α3b(t−e)+10−3ωwhere j=1, 2, 3, 4 is the signal index and a, b, c, d, e, μ, ω, α1, α2 and α3 are values randomly sampled from the probability distributions listed in Table 1.One hundred trajectories have been simulated using Eq. (11) for signals 1, 2 and 4, and Eq. (13) for signal 3 (Table 2). These trajectories are intended to reproduce the nominal behaviour of a system, e.g. the operation of a plant when no anomalies or faults occur. Hereafter, they will be referred to as ‘normal condition trajectories’. To artificially reproduce possible anomalous behaviours of the system, 14 trajectories characterized by signal functional behaviours different from those of the corresponding signals in the 100 trajectories have been simulated according to the Eqs. (11-13) according to the scheme provided in Table 2.The performance of the proposed model for missing data reconstruction will be evaluated in terms of its accuracy, i.e. the ability of providing correct reconstructions of missing data. The metric used is the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the reconstructions provided by the model and the true values [19], averaged over a number of different test trajectories.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A fuzzy similarity-based method for missing data reconstruction has been proposed in the context of on-line condition monitoring of industrial components. The method allows performing signal reconstructions in multidimensional time series. It has been applied with success to an artificial case study and a real industrial application concerning the reconstruction of missing data in nuclear component transients, and it has been shown superior to an AAKR-based method of literature.Given the difficulty of the signal reconstruction task in situations characterized by the presence of long segments containing missing values, we think that it would be important to associate the signal reconstruction with an estimate of its degree of confidence, which should take into account the amount and quality of the information used to perform the reconstruction. This will be object of future research activity. Indeed, future work will be devoted to estimate the degree of confidence in the provided signal reconstruction, taking into account the amount of information available in the reference trajectories used to perform the reconstruction.
