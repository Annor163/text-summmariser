@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We consider the one-dimensional skiving stock problem which is strongly related to the dual bin packing problem: find the maximum number of items with minimum length L that can be constructed by connecting a given supply ofm∈Nsmaller item lengthsl1,…,lmwith availabilitiesb1,…,bm. For this optimization problem, we present three new models (the arcflow model, the onestick model, and a model of Kantorovich-type) and investigate their relationships, especially regarding their respective continuous relaxations. To this end, numerical computations are provided. As a main result, we prove the equivalence between the arcflow model, the onestick approach and the existing pattern-oriented standard model. In particular, this equivalence is shown to hold for the corresponding continuous relaxations, too.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional skiving stock problem (SSP) which is strongly related to the dual bin packing problem (DBPP). In the classical formulation,m∈Ndifferent item lengthsl1,…,lmwith availabilitiesb1,…,bmare given, the so-called item supply. We aim at maximizing the number of products with minimum length L that can be constructed by connecting the items on hand. Such computations are of high interest in many real world applications, e.g. industrial production processes (see Zak, 2003 for an overview) or politico-economic problems (cf. Assmann, Johnson, Kleitman, & Leung, 1984; Labbé, Laporte, & Martello, 1995). Furthermore, also neighboring tasks, such as dual vector packing problems (Csirik, Frenk, Galambos, & Rinnooy Kan, 1991) or the maximum cardinality bin packing problem (Bruno & Downey, 1985; Peeters & Degraeve, 2006), are often associated or even identified with the dual bin packing problem. These formulations are of practical use as well since they are applied in multiprocessor scheduling problems (Alvim, Ribeiro, Glover, & Aloise, 2004) or surgical case plannings (Vijayakumar, Parikh, Scott, Barnes, & Gallimore, 2013).The considered optimization problem, for the casebi=1(i∈I:={1,…,m}),was firstly mentioned by Assmann et al. (1984), based on the doctoral thesis (Assmann, 1983), and denoted by dual bin packing problem. Therein, the authors mainly investigate heuristic approaches and provide results regarding the quality and average case behavior of the presented methods. Further contributions, especially in terms of exact approaches to the DBPP, have been studied in Labbé et al. (1995) and Peeters and Degraeve (2006) where two branching algorithms are introduced.Based on practical preliminary thoughts (Johnson, Rennick, & Zak, 1997), a generalization for larger availabilitiesbi∈N(i∈I)has been considered in Zak (2003) also motivating the term of skiving stock problem. In that paper, Zak formulates a pattern-oriented model of the SSP with an infinite number of variables and provides first (numerical) results regarding the gap of this optimization problem, i.e., the difference between the optimal values of the continuous relaxation of the SSP and the SSP itself. But to our best knowledge, there are only a few works concerning theoretical aspects.In this paper, we introduce three new models for the skiving stock problem which only require a pseudo-polynomial number of variables and constraints. Two of them are based on position-indexed and order-indexed approaches that are related to the arcflow and onecut formulations (see Dyckhoff, 1981; Valério de Carvalho, 2002) of the extensively studied one-dimensional cutting stock problem. In contrast to the standard model of Zak (2003), these new models can cope with larger and practical meaningful instances. Additionally, we provide some techniques in order to significantly reduce the total amount of variables and constraints within these two models. For the sake of completeness, the third model refers to the well known Kantorovich approach (Kantorovich, 1939) and is shown to have a weak continuous relaxation and many symmetric solutions. For this purpose, we present an approach to avoid symmetries with the help of additional linear constraints and binary variables.We provide theoretical and numerical investigations on the relationship of these models and prove, as a main result, the equivalence between the continuous relaxations of the standard model and the new position-indexed and order-indexed formulations.Throughout this paper, we assume without loss of generality that all input-data are positive integers. Additionally, we expect the item lengths to be smaller than L since each item i ∈ I with li≥ L already represents a finished product and does not have to be considered within the optimization. Finally, we assume that two items can be connected directly, i.e., without any overlap or an intermediate composite. If, in a certain practical application, this situation is not given from the beginning, we can, depending on the particular case, shorten or extend the item lengths and L obtaining an equivalent skiving stock problem where this third assumption is fulfilled.The next section deals with the above mentioned standard model (Zak, 2003). Section 3 introduces an arcflow and an onestick model, respectively, and proves their equivalence to Zak’s formulation. Afterwards, we present a model of Kantorovich-type and show how symmetries can be avoided therein. In a final step, we compare all approaches by means of numerical computations, give some conclusions and an outlook of future research.In the following, we refer to a particular skiving stock problem with given input data as an instanceE=(m,l,L,b)of the SSP withl=(l1,…,lm)⊤andb=(b1,…,bm)⊤. Any feasible arrangement of items which leads to a final product of minimum length L is called (packing) pattern of E. We always represent a pattern by a nonnegative vectora=(a1,…,am)⊤∈Z+m. There,ai∈Z+denotes the number of items of type i ∈ I that is contained in the considered pattern. Note thata∈Z+monly provides information as to the total number, but not the specific positioning or order of the necessary items. For a given instance E the set of all patterns is defined byPE:={a∈Z+m|l⊤a≥L}. LetJ˜:=J˜(E)be an index set of PEandxj∈Z+the number, how often the patternaj=(a1j,…,amj)⊤∈PEis used in the optimization. Then we obtain, (cf. Zak, 2003),Zak′smodeloftheSSPz=∑j∈J˜xj→maxs.t.∑j∈J˜aijxj≤bi,i∈I,xj∈Z+,j∈J˜.Note that this model has an infinite number of variables, but in every feasible solution there are only a finite number of nonzero variables. In contrast, the feasible set of the continuous relaxation contains (feasible) solutions with an infinite number of positive x-variables. Therefore, we would like to present a method to obtain a finite formulation of Zak’s model. To this end, only minimal patterns of E are considered. A pattern a ∈ PEis called minimal if there does not exist any patterna˜∈PEsuch thata˜≠aanda˜≤ahold (componentwise). LetPE☆denote the set of minimal patterns and J ≔ J(E) a corresponding index set. Since l⊤a < 2L is a necessary condition fora∈PE☆we obtain|PE☆|=|J|<∞. Now, we can formulate the(1)StandardmodeloftheSSPzS=∑j∈Jxj→maxs.t.∑j∈Jaijxj≤bi,i∈I,(2)xj∈Z+,j∈J.The objective function maximizes the total number of connected final products, whereas constraints (1) observe the item supply limitations. In most cases, it is not reasonable or even not possible to have all patterns available prior to the optimization process due to the huge cardinality ofPE☆. Hence, common solvers, like CPLEX, usually cannot be applied to tackle this problem. However, at least the continuous relaxation of the standard model can be solved efficiently by column generation. In order to solve the ILP, branch-and-price techniques can be applied as in the context of one-dimensional cutting, see Belov and Scheithauer (2006) for instance. Note that, in this case, the computational behavior strongly depends on the choice of an appropriate branching rule. A further way to tackle the integer problem consists in the consideration of other modeling approaches.In this section, we assume the item lengths to be of strictly decreasing order, i.e.,L>l1>l2>⋯>lm>0.If such an order is not given from the beginning, we can easily obtain it by a sorting algorithm, e.g. merge sort, inO(m·logm)operations.For a given instance E we define the maximum length of a minimal patternvmax:=max{l⊤a|a∈PE☆}.Then, we consider the directed graphG=(V,E)given by the set of verticesV={0,1,…,vmax}and the set of arcsE:={(p,q)∈V×V|p<L,q−p∈{l1,…,lm}}.Note that an arc(p,q)∈Erepresents the positioning of an item of lengthq−p=lj∈{l1,…,lm}with its left point at vertexp∈V. Each paths=(v0,v1,…,vk)inGfromv0=0to vk≥ L corresponds to a (not necessarily minimal) pattern a ∈ PE. Since, additionally, our current graphGcontains, in most cases, an oversized number of arcs and vertices, we would like to apply two reduction principles in order to solve these problems:1.Obviously, we only need to consider vertices that are integer linear combinations of the given item lengths, since all other nodes cannot lie on a paths=(v0,v1,…,vk)fromv0=0to vk≥ L. Thus, we can replace our set of vertices with a reduced one, i.e., we defineV′:={v∈V|∃a∈Z+m:l⊤a=v}.The first restriction is not sufficient for verticesv∈Vwith v ≥ L since these nodes can belong to non-minimal patterns. Considering the instanceE=(2,(7,2),10,(7,7)),we note that12∈V′,but there is no minimal patterna∈PE☆withl⊤a=12. LetL:={l⊤a|a∈PE☆}be the set of the total lengths of the minimum patterns. Then we can replaceV′withV′′:=V′∩({0,1,…,L−1}∪L).These reductions also lead us to a reduced set of arcsE′:={(p,q)∈V′′×V′′|p<L,q−p∈{l1,…,lm}}.If we want to assign a path s inG′=(V′′,E′)to a minimal patterna∈PE☆,this identification is not unique since a does not contain any information about the particular arrangement of the items. We therefore like to restrict our investigations to monotonically decreasing paths, i.e., paths whose corresponding item lengths are sorted in descending order. This approach is based on a similar method (cf. Scheithauer, 2008) for the well known arcflow model of the cutting stock problem (Valério de Carvalho, 1998). For eachp∈V′′∖Lwe define an index μ(p) ∈ I ∪ {0} by(3)μ(p):={0ifp=0,min{i∈I|p−li∈V′′,i≥μ(p−li)}ifp∈V′′∖(L∪{0}).Note that the minimum in (3) is well defined. This leads us to a new set of arcsE′′:={(p,q)∈V′′×V′′|p<L,q−p=li∈{l1,…,lm},i≥μ(p)}and a reduced graphG′′=(V′′,E′′).Note thatE′′is independent of the particular choice ofb∈Nm.Remark 1The introduction of μ does not solve the problem of equivalent paths within the graphG′′entirely. Consider, by way of example, the instanceE=(2,(4,2),8,(2,2))where, obviously,μ(0)=0,μ(2)=2andμ(4)=1hold. Subsequently,G′′especially contains the two paths0→2→4→8and0→4→6→8which both refer to the patterna=(1,2)⊤. Nonetheless, this method leads to a significant reduction of the set of arcs, see Section 5 for corresponding computational results.For the sake of a better comprehensibility of the upcoming model, we introduce the setsA+(q):={p∈V′′|(p,q)∈E′′},A−(q):={r∈V′′|(q,r)∈E′′},for everyq∈V′′and the setE(i):={(p,q)∈E′′|q−p=li}for every i ∈ I. Note that the casesA+(q)=∅andA−(q)=∅are possible for someq∈V′′. We are now able to state the(4)ArcflowmodeloftheSSPzAF=∑q∈A−(0)x0q→maxs.t.∑p∈A+(q)xpq=∑r∈A−(q)xqr,q∈V′′∖(L∪{0}),(5)∑(p,q)∈E(i)xpq≤bi,i∈I,(6)xpq∈Z+,(p,q)∈E′′.Constraints (4) can be interpreted as a flow conservation: at every interior vertex which is not a possible endpoint the number of incoming items has to equal the number of outgoing items. Thus, the objective function maximizes not only the items placed at the nodev0=0but also the total number of constructed final products with minimum length L. Conditions (5) ensure that the given supply is not exceeded. In this arcflow model, the numbers of variables and constraints areO(mL)andO(m+L),respectively.Example 1Forb∈Nmconsider the instanceE=(3,(5,3,2),10,b)withmax{l⊤a|a∈PE☆}=12. Then, the arcflow graphG′′consists of 12 vertices and 17 arcs, as depicted in Fig. 1.We want to investigate the relationship between the optimal values of the arcflow and the standard model. The following proof is similar to Valério de Carvalho (2002, Proposition 5.1) but has to contain, due to Remark 1, an argumentation on the basis of equivalence classes of paths inG′′.Theorem 1Let x be a feasible solution of the arcflow model with objective value z(x). Then there is a feasible solutionx˜of the standard model with the same objective value. In particular,(zS)☆≥(zAF)☆holds for the optimal values (zS)⋆and (zAF)⋆of the standard and the arc-flow model, respectively.Letx∈Z+|E′′|be a feasible solution of the arcflow model with objective value z(x). Consider the set Γ of all paths inG′′=(V′′,E′′)fromv0=0to an element ofL. For each γ ∈ Γ we define a variable λγstating how often the respective path is used in the feasible solution x. Due tox∈Z+|E′′|,each variable λγ(γ ∈ Γ) is a nonnegative integer.Since constraints (4) hold for the feasible solution x the objective value z(x) can be obtained as(7)∑γ∈Γλγ=z(x).For each(p,q)∈E′′and γ ∈ Γ we introduce a decision variable by means ofxpqγ:={1ifthearc(p,q)iscontainedinpathγ,0otherwise.Let the vectoraγ:=(a1γ,…,amγ)⊤∈Z+mdenote the number of items of type i ∈ I that are contained in path γ ∈ Γ. Since each path corresponds to a minimal pattern we obtainl⊤aγ∈Landaγ∈PE☆. According to this construction,(8)aiγ=∑(p,q)∈E(i)xpqγholds for every i ∈ I and γ ∈ Γ. We now define an equivalence relation ∼ on the set Γ by means ofγ1∼γ2⟺aγ1=aγ2,i.e., two paths are equivalent if and only if they contain the same number of each item length. Letφ:Γ/∼→Γ,[γ]↦φ([γ])=γ☆be a mapping assigning each equivalence class to its unique representative that is indicated by monotonically decreasing item lengths. Note that this mapping is not surjective in general, cf. Remark 1. We therefore consider Γ⋆ ≔ Im(φ)⊆Γ and define the bijectionκ:J→Γ☆,j↦κ(j),where κ(j) corresponds to the path γ⋆ ∈ Γ⋆ that uniquely belongs to the minimal patternaj∈PE☆. In particular, we obtain(9)aij=aiκ(j).Defining(10)λ˜γ☆:=∑s∈[γ☆]λsfor each γ⋆ ∈ Γ⋆, we claim that an appropriate feasible solution of the standard model is given by(11)x˜j:=λ˜κ(j)for all j ∈ J. Indeed, we obtain:1.Sinceλγ∈Z+(γ ∈ Γ) holds eachx˜j(j ∈ J) is a nonnegative integer.The objective value results from∑j∈Jx˜j=(11)∑j∈Jλ˜κ(j)=(κbijective)∑γ☆∈Γ☆λ˜γ☆=(10)∑γ☆∈Γ☆∑s∈[γ☆]λs=(partition)∑γ∈Γλγ=(7)z(x).Furthermore,x˜satisfies constraint (1) since we obtain∑j∈Jaijx˜j=(11)∑j∈Jaijλ˜κ(j)=(9)∑j∈Jaiκ(j)λ˜κ(j)=(κbijective)∑γ☆∈Γ☆aiγ☆λ˜γ☆=(10)∑γ☆∈Γ☆aiγ☆∑s∈[γ☆]λs=(☆)∑γ☆∈Γ☆∑s∈[γ☆]aisλs=(partition)∑γ∈Γaiγλγ=(8)∑γ∈Γ∑(p,q)∈E(i)xpqγλγ=∑(p,q)∈E(i)∑γ∈Γxpqγλγ=(⋄)∑(p,q)∈E(i)xpq≤(5)bifor each i ∈ I. Note that in (⋆) the property∀γ☆∈Γ☆∀s∈[γ☆]:aiγ☆=aisand in (⋄) the property∀(p,q)∈E′′:xpq=∑γ∈Γxpqγλγwere used, respectively.Thus, the theorem is proved.□Obviously, this theorem still remains true if we consider the continuous relaxations of both models. Only the assertionλγ∈Z+is replaced by λγ≥ 0 (γ ∈ Γ) which leads tox˜j≥0(j ∈ J).Corollary 2Let x be a feasible solution of the continuous relaxation of the arcflow model with objective value z(x). Then there is a feasible solutionx˜of the continuous relaxation of the standard model with the same objective value. In particular,(zrelS)☆≥(zrelAF)☆holds for the optimal values of both models.We now focus on the reverse direction starting with a feasible solution of the standard model.Theorem 3Let x be a feasible solution of the standard model with objective value z(x). Then there is a feasible solutionx˜of the arcflow model with the same objective value. In particular,(zS)☆≤(zAF)☆holds for the optimal objective values.Letx=(x1,…,x|J|)⊤∈Z+|J|be a feasible solution of the standard model with objective value z(x). For each arc(p,q)∈E′′and pattern j ∈ J we define a decision variableypqj:={1ifinthepathκ(j)anitemoflengthq−pisplacedbetweentheverticespandq,0otherwise,where κ represents the bijection from the last proof. Letq∈V′′withq∉L∪{0}and j ∈ J. Then, we obtain two fundamental properties:(P1) Ifypqj=1holds for some(p,q)∈E′′,then there is a unique indexs˜∈A−(q)such thatyqs˜j=1holds and the assertionyqsj=0is true for alls∈A−(q)withs≠s˜.(P2) If for allp∈A+(q)the assertionypqj=0holds, then we obtainyqsj=0for alls∈A−(q).For each pair(p,q)∈E′′we define(12)x˜pq:=∑j∈Jypqjxjclaiming that this is a feasible solution of the arcflow model with appropriate objective value. Sincexj∈Z+(j ∈ J) constraints (6) are satisfied. Furthermore, we can state:1.Due toA−(0)={l1,…,lm}the objective value results from∑q∈A−(0)x˜0q=∑i=1mx˜0,li=(12)∑i=1m∑j∈Jy0,lijxj=∑j∈Jxj∑i=1my0lij︸=1=∑j∈Jxj=z(x).Note that for each j ∈ J the assertion∑i=1my0lij=1is true since every path κ(j) has to start with a unique item length.We now verify constraints (5). Let i ∈ I be arbitrarily chosen. Then we obtain∑(p,q)∈E(i)x˜pq=(12)∑(p,q)∈E(i)∑j∈Jypqjxj=∑j∈Jxj∑(p,q)∈E(i)ypqj︸=aij=∑j∈Jaijxj≤(1)bi.Letq∈V′′∖(L∪{0})be arbitrarily chosen, then we can use the assertions (P1) and (P2). Observe that the inequality(13)∑p∈A+(q)ypqj≤1holds for all j ∈ J since in each path κ(j) there is at most one item length that can end in the vertex q. Hence,∑p∈A+(q)x˜pq=(12)∑p∈A+(q)∑j∈Jypqjxj=∑j∈Jxj∑p∈A+(q)ypqjfollows. Since (13) holds, for each j ∈ J there are two possible cases:Case 1: Assuming that the left hand side in (13) equals zero, we can apply (P2) and obtain∑p∈A+(q)ypqj=0=∑s∈A−(q)yqsj.Case 2: Assuming that the left hand side in (13) equals one, there is a uniquep˜∈A+(q)withyp˜qj=1. Hence, the assertionypqj=0holds for allp∈A+(q)withp≠p˜. Due to property (P1), there is a uniques˜∈A−(q)withyqs˜j=1,and the assertionyqsj=0holds for alls∈A−(q)withs≠s˜. Thus, we obtain∑p∈A+(q)ypqj=yp˜qj=1=yqs˜j=∑s∈A−(q)yqsj.Both cases lead to the equation(14)∑p∈A+(q)ypqj=∑s∈A−(q)yqsj.Thus, we can finish our computations with∑p∈A+(q)x˜pq=∑j∈Jxj∑p∈A+(q)ypqj=(14)∑j∈Jxj∑s∈A−(q)yqsj=∑s∈A−(q)∑j∈Jyqsjxj=(12)∑s∈A−(q)x˜qs.Hence, all constraints are satisfied.□As above, this theorem also remains true if the continuous relaxations are considered.Corollary 4Let x be a feasible solution of the continuous relaxation of the standard model with objective value z(x). Then there is a feasible solutionx˜of the continuous relaxation of the arcflow model with the same objective value. In particular,(zrelS)☆≤(zrelAF)☆holds for the optimal values of both models.We have proved that both models provide the same optimal objective value, even in the case where the continuous relaxations are considered.Remark 2The equivalence between the arcflow and the standard model can also be proved by the application of results from polyhedral theory as it was done in the case of one-dimensional cutting, see Valério de Carvalho (1999, Proposition 2.1).While in the standard model (entire) patterns are considered, we now take a different approach focusing on each single connection between two items that is necessary to construct a pattern. For the cutting stock problem, this method is known as the onecut model (Dyckhoff, 1981). Since in the skiving scenario we are not confronted with cuts we would like to refer to this new model as the onestick model indicating that we rivet on sticking items together separately.For this purpose, letL:={L1,…,Lt}denote the set of the lengths of all minimal patterns,Z:={w∈{0,1,…,L−1}|∃a∈Z+m∖{0,e1,…,em}:l⊤a=w}the set of all intermediate lengths, with ei(i ∈ I) as ith unit vector, andD:={l1,…,lm}the set of all item lengths. Without loss of generality we can assume each single connection process to contain at least an item of the given item supply. Letypq∈Z+denote the number of objects of lengthp∈L∪Zwhich has been constructed by sticking together an item of lengthp−q∈D∪Zand an item of lengthq∈D. Here, we can assume thatp−q≥qholds in order to avoid a double modeling of the same single connection. Hence, we obtain the index setM:={(p,q)|q∈D,p−q∈D∪Z,p≥2q}.Similar to the arcflow model, this model also contains several sequences of onesticks that lead to the same minimal pattern. In analogy to (3), we define an indexρ(r):={iifr=li∈D,min{i∈I|r−li∈D∪Z,i≥ρ(r−li)}otherwise,for eachr∈Z∪D,and, therefore, can reduce the index set of variables toM′:={(p,q)|q=li∈D,p−q∈D∪Z,p≥2q,i≥ρ(p−q)}.Additionally, we define(15)Nr:={biifr=li∈D,0otherwise,for allr∈D∪Z,i.e., the number of initial items of length r. Thus, we obtain the(16)OnestickmodeloftheSSPzOS=∑k=1t∑(Lk,q)∈M′yLk,q→maxs.t.∑(r+q,q)∈M′yr+q,q+∑(q,r)∈M′yqr≤∑(r,q)∈M′yrq+Nr,r∈D∪Z,(17)ypq∈Z+,(p,q)∈M′.The objective function maximizes the number of finished objects since their lengths are equal to the elements ofL. For a givenr∈D∪Z,contraints (16) have to be interpreted as follows:1.The left hand side of (16) counts how often an object of length r is used to build larger objects, either as the left part (cf. first sum) or the right part (cf. second sum) of a onestick.The right hand side counts how often an object of length r has been constructed out of smaller items and adds the initial number of objects of length r.Altogether, these constraints ensure that the number of items of length r being used to build larger items cannot exceed the sum of initial and constructed items of length r.LetΩ:={{(pj,qj)}j=1k|k∈N,p1−q1∈D,pk∈L,(p1,q1),…,(pk,qk)∈M′,∀j∈{2,…,k}:pj−qj=pj−1}be the set of all sequences of onesticks that lead to an object length ofL,i.e., to a finished product. For the sake of convenience, an element ω ∈ Ω is called sticksequence. In the following theorem, we exploit the fact that, obviously, each sticksequence can be identified with a minimal pattern.Theorem 5Let y be a feasible solution of the onestick model with objective value z(y). Then there is a feasible solutionx˜of the standard model with the same objective value. In particular,(zS)☆≥(zOS)☆holds for the optimal values (zS)⋆and (zOS)⋆of both models.Let y be a feasible solution of the onestick model with objective value z(y). For each ω ∈ Ω we define a variableσω∈Z+providing how often this sticksequence is used in the feasible solution y. Due toy∈Z+|M′|,we easily obtainσω∈Z+(ω ∈ Ω). Subsequently, the equality∑ω∈Ωσω=z(y)holds. For every(p,q)∈M′and ω ∈ Ω we now introduce a decision variable by means ofxp,qω:={1if(p,q)iscontainedinω,0otherwise.Letaω:=(a1ω,…,amω)⊤∈Z+mdescribe the number of items of typei∈{1,…,m}being contained in the sticksequence ω ∈ Ω. Because ofl⊤aω∈Land the definition ofM′,we obtainaω∈PE☆. Note that the ith component of this vector can be determined by(18)aiω=∑(p,q+li)∈M′xp,q+liω+∑(q+li,q)∈M′xq+li,qω−∑(li,q)∈M′xli,qω.The third sum is necessary since it might be possible to construct an item length liout of smaller item lengths.In analogy to the arcflow model, we define an equivalence relation on Ω by(19)ω1∼ω2⟺aω1=aω2for ω1, ω2 ∈ Ω. Based on this, there exists a mappingφ:Ω/∼→Ω,[ω]↦φ([ω])=ω☆where ω⋆ represents the unique sticksequence of [ω] which is characterized by non-increasing item lengths. Let Ω⋆ ≔ Im(φ), then there is a bijectionκ˜:J→Ω☆,j↦κ˜(j)whereκ˜(j)denotes the sticksequence ω⋆ ∈ Ω⋆ withaω☆=aj.In particular, we obtain(20)aiκ˜(j)=aijfor all j ∈ J and all i ∈ I. Setting(21)σ˜ω☆=∑ω∈[ω☆]σωfor each ω⋆ ∈ Ω⋆, we claim that an appropriate feasible solution of the standard model is given by(22)x˜j:=σ˜κ˜(j)for all j ∈ J. Indeed, we obtain:1.Sinceσω∈Z+(ω ∈ Ω) holds eachx˜j(j ∈ J) is a nonnegative integer, too.The objective value results to∑j∈Jx˜j=(22)∑j∈Jσ˜κ˜(j)=(κ˜bijective)∑ω☆∈Ω☆σ˜ω☆=(21)∑ω☆∈Ω☆∑ω∈[ω☆]σω=(partition)∑ω∈Ωσω=z(y).Constraints (1) are satisfied:∑j∈Jaijx˜j=(22)∑j∈Jaijσ˜κ˜(j)=(20)∑j∈Jaiκ˜(j)σ˜κ˜(j)=(κ˜bijective)∑ω☆∈Ω☆aiω☆σ˜ω☆=(21)∑ω☆∈Ω☆aiω☆∑w∈[ω☆]σω=(19)∑ω☆∈Ω☆∑ω∈[ω☆]aiωσω=(partition)∑ω∈Ωaiωσω=(18)∑ω∈Ω(∑(p,q+li)∈M′xp,q+liωσω+∑(q+li,q)∈M′xq+li,qωσω−∑(li,q)∈M′xli,qωσω)=∑(p,q+li)∈M′∑ω∈Ωxp,q+liωσω+∑(q+li,q)∈M′∑ω∈Ωxq+li,qωσω−∑(li,q)∈M′∑ω∈Ωxli,qωσω=∑(p,q+li)∈M′yp,q+li+∑(q+li,q)∈M′yq+li,q−∑(li,q)∈M′yli,q≤(16)Nli≤(15)bi.Observe that for each(p,q)∈M′the equality∑ω∈Ωxp,qωσω=ypqhas been used in the penultimate line.□This theorem remains true if we consider the continuous relaxations of both models.Corollary 6Let y be a feasible solution of the continuous relaxation of the onestick model with objective value z(y). Then there is a feasible solutionx˜of the continuous relaxation of the standard model with the same objective value. In particular,(zrelS)☆≥(zrelOS)☆holds for the optimal values of the respective models.As we have seen, the methods of the proof are quite similar to Theorem 1. Since this is also true for the second implication we would like to shorten the comments in the following proof slightly.Theorem 7Let x be a feasible solution of the standard model with objective value z(x). Then there is a feasible solutiony˜of the onestick model with the same objective value. In particular,(zS)☆≤(zOS)☆holds for the optimal values of both models.Let x be a feasible solution of the standard model with objective value z(x). For each(p,q)∈M′and all j ∈ J we define a decision variable by(23)yp,qj:={1ifinthesticksequenceκ˜(j)anobjectoflengthq∈Disstucktoanobjectoflengthp−q∈D∪Z,0otherwise,whereκ˜represents the bijection between J und Ω⋆ from Theorem 5. Letr∈D∪Zand j ∈ J be given, then there are two important properties:(A)Letr∈Z∖D. If there existsq∈Dwith(r,q)∈M′andyr,qj=1,then there is a unique index(r+q˜,q˜)∈M′withyr+q˜,q˜j=1,i.e., the equalityyr+q′,q′j=0holds for all(r+q′,q′)∈M′withq′≠q˜.If for allq∈Dwith(r,q)∈M′the assertionyr,qj=0holds, then alsoyr+q˜,q˜j=0is true for all(r+q˜,q˜)∈M′.Defining(24)y˜p,q:=∑j∈Jyp,qjxjfor every(p,q)∈M′,we claim that we found an appropriate feasible solution of the onestick model. Indeed, we obtain:1.Sincexj∈Z+(j ∈ J) holds the nonnegative integrality of (24) follows from (23).The objective value results to∑k=1t∑(Lk,q)∈M′y˜Lk,q=(24)∑k=1t∑(Lk,q)∈M′∑j∈JyLk,qjxj=∑j∈Jxj∑k=1t∑(Lk,q)∈M′yLk,qj︸=1=∑j∈Jxj=z(x).Note that each sticksequence has to end with an unique element ofL,such that the assertion connected to the curly bracket is justified.Letr=li∈Dbe given, then(25)∑(r+q,q)∈M′yr+q,qj+∑(q,r)∈M′yq,rj−∑(r,q)∈M′yr,qj=aijholds for all j ∈ J since all objects of length liinκ˜(j)that have not been constructed out of smaller item lengths have to appear in the minimal pattern aj, cf. (18).Hence, we obtain∑(r+q,q)∈M′y˜r+q,q+∑(q,r)∈M′y˜q,r−∑(r,q)∈M′y˜r,q=(24)∑(r+q,q)∈M′∑j∈Jyr+q,qjxj+∑(q,r)∈M′∑j∈Jyq,rjxj−∑(r,q)∈M′∑j∈Jyr,qjxj=∑j∈Jxj(∑(r+q,q)∈M′yr+q,qj+∑(q,r)∈M′yq,rj−∑(r,q)∈M′yr,qj)=(25)∑j∈Jaijxj≤(1)bi=(15)Nr.Letr∈Z∖Dbe a ”real” intermediate length. Then,M′does not contain any element in terms of (q, r) since the second component of such a pair has to belong toD. It follows that the assertion(26)∑(q,r)∈M′yq,rj=0is true for all j ∈ J. Furthermore, the relation(27)∑(r+q,q)∈M′yr+q,qj−∑(r,q)∈M′yr,qj=0holds for every j ∈ J since the right sum contains at most one nonzero element. If this sum equals zero, assertion (B) leads to (27), otherwise we can apply (A) obtaining the same result.Altogether, it follows that:∑(r+q,q)∈M′y˜r+q,q+∑(q,r)∈M′y˜q,r−∑(r,q)∈M′y˜r,q=(24)∑(r+q,q)∈M′∑j∈Jyr+q,qjxj+∑(q,r)∈M′∑j∈Jyq,rjxj−∑(r,q)∈M′∑j∈Jyr,qjxj=∑j∈Jxj(∑(r+q,q)∈M′yr+q,qj+∑(q,r)∈M′yq,rj−∑(r,q)∈M′yr,qj)=(26)∑j∈Jxj(∑(r+q,q)∈M′yr+q,qj−∑(r,q)∈M′yr,qj)=(27)∑j∈Jxj·0=0=(15)Nrwhich completes the proof.□This theorem remains true if we focus on the continuous relaxations of both models.Corollary 8Let x be a feasible solution of the continuous relaxation of the standard model with objective value z(x). Then there is a feasible solutiony˜of the continuous relaxation of the onestick model with the same objective value. In particular,(zrelS)☆≤(zrelOS)☆holds for the optimal values of both models.Hence, we have proved the equivalence of all three approaches, i.e., the standard, the arcflow and the onestick model. Remarkably, this equivalence also holds in the continuous case. In particular, the alternative models (i.e., the arcflow model and the onestick model) can be solved by software like CPLEX also offering a possibility to investigate the gap of the skiving stock problem.In the last subsections, we noticed a certain relationship between our two new approaches. Both of them avoid the modeling of (entire) patterns and only consider the position or order of the single items. Obviously, each onestick(p,q)∈M′can also be interpreted as the positioning of an item with length q at the vertexp−q∈V′′in the graphG′′,i.e., as an arc(p−q,p)∈E′′. Thus, in a certain extent, both alternative models share a common structure of variables. We therefore aim at investigating which of these models is expected to require a lower computational effort. To this end, we particularly rivet on the two criteria of the number of variables and the number of constraints.Proposition 9The assertionnconAF−nconOS=mholds for the numbers of constraints in the alternative models.Note that(28)V′′∖(L∪{0})=D∪Zis true since both sets are equal to{w∈{lm,…,L−1}|∃a∈Z+m:l⊤a=w}.Hence, it follows that:nconAF−nconOS=(|V′′∖(L∪{0})|+m)−|D∪Z|=(28)mwhich proves the proposition.□The proof of a corresponding result for the number of variables is much more complex. Therefore, we split it into different steps starting with the following relation between the indices μ and ρ.Lemma 10The assertion(29)μ(r)=ρ(r)holds for allr∈D∪Z.Letr∈D∪Zbe given, then μ is well defined due to (28). At first, we consider the caser=li∈D. In this case,ρ(r)=iholds by definition. We prove thatμ(r)=iis true, too.1.The inequality μ(r) ≥ i holds: Fori=1this assertion is clear since μ(r) ∈ I has to be satisfied. For i ≥ 2 the inequalityr−li−1<0holds implying thatr−li−1∉V′′which leads to μ(r) ≥ i.The inequality μ(r) ≤ i holds: Obviously,r−li=0∈V′′andi≥μ(r−li)=μ(0)=0are true. From the minimization in (3), we can reason μ(r) ≤ i.Now letr∈Z∖Dbe given. Then, the assertion is obviously true since both definitions are equal, cf. (28).□In order to exploit the above mentioned relationship between the index sets of the variables within the alternative models, we consider the mappingf:M′→E′′,(p,q)↦(p−q,p).It can easily be verified that f is well defined and injective.Lemma 11The inequalitynvarAF−nvarOS≥mholds for the numbers of variables in the alternative models.We show that for each i ∈ I the pair(0,li)∈E′′has no preimage under f, and, hence, the assertion|E′′|−|Im(f)|≥mis true. For the sake of contradiction, we assume an index i ∈ I and an arc(p,q)∈M′to satisfyf(p,q)=(0,li). Then, the second component of this equality impliesp=li. Due top−q=0,the equalityq=lifollows immediately. But then, p ≥ 2q is not possible which gives the contradiction. Hence, we obtainnvarAF−nvarOS=|E′′|−|M′|=|E′′|−|Im(f)|≥msince f is a bijection betweenM′and Im(f).□The reverse inequality needs the following preliminary result.Lemma 12The inequality2p˜−q˜≥0holds for all(p˜,q˜)∈E′′withp˜≠0.Let(p˜,q˜)∈E′′withp˜≠0be given. We assume the statement to be wrong, i.e.,2p˜−q˜<0or equivalently(30)p˜<q˜−p˜.1.Since(p˜,q˜)∈E′′holds there exists i⋆ ∈ I withq˜−p˜=li☆. Letj☆:=μ(p˜),then we obtain(31)i☆≥j☆due to the definition ofE′′.By reason of (30) we note thatli☆>p˜holds. In particular,li☆is larger than all objects appearing in paths fromv0=0top˜in the graphG′=(V′′,E′′). LetΓ(p˜)denote the set of these paths, then we can certainly stateΓ(p˜)≠∅due top˜∈V′′andp˜≠0. Sinceμ(p˜)=j☆holds there has to be a path inΓ(p˜)containing an item of index j⋆. This leads toli☆>lj☆contradicting (31).Hence, the initial assumption was wrong and the lemma is proved.□Now we are able to prove the second inequality.Lemma 13The inequalitynvarAF−nvarOS≤mholds for the numbers of variables of the alternative models.Let(p˜,q˜)∈E′′withp˜≠0be given. We show that|E′′|−|Im(f)|≤mis true proving(p˜,q˜)∈Im(f)by means of indicating a corresponding preimage. To this end, observe thatf(q˜,q˜−p˜)=(p˜,q˜)holds obviously. Definingp:=q˜andq:=q˜−p˜,only(p,q)∈M′remains to prove. Indeed, we obtain:1.Fromq=q˜−p˜=li∈{l1,…,lm},the assertionq∈Dfollows directly.First of all, observe thatp−q=q˜−(q˜−p˜)=p˜∈V′′holds. From the definition ofE′′,we obtainp˜<Lleading top˜∉L. According top˜≠0,we concludep−q=p˜∈V′′∖(L∪{0})=(28)D∪Z.By Lemma 12 we obtain2p˜−q˜≥0,such that p ≥ 2q holds.Due top˜∈D∪Z(cf. (ii)), Lemma 10 is applicable and leads toi≥μ(p˜)=(29)ρ(p˜)=ρ(q˜−(q˜−p˜))=ρ(p−q).Altogether, we obtain(p,q)∈M′and(p˜,q˜)∈Im(f)entailingnvarAF−nvarOS=|E′′|−|M′|=|E′′|−|Im(f)|≤mwhich completes the proof.□Hence, we have shown that the onestick model differs from the arcflow model by exactly m fewer variables and constraints. In general, especially for practical meaningful instances, this number is ”small” in contrast to both the total numbers of variablesO(mL)and restrictionsO(m+L). We therefore expect the average calculation times of the onestick model to be smaller than those ones of the arcflow model, but not differing that much among one another. This behavior will be investigated numerically in Section 5.In this section, we present a method to transfer the well known Kantorovich approach (Kantorovich, 1939) to the skiving stock problem. For the sake of a better presentability, we apply the terminology of the equivalent dual bin packing problem. Letu∈Z+be an upper bound of the maximum number of bins that can be filled by the given item supply. Thus, a natural choice isu=⌊l⊤bL⌋.For eachk∈K:={1,…,u}we define a decision variable byyk={1ifthekthbinisentirelyfilled,0otherwise.Furthermore, letxik∈Z+((i, k) ∈ I × K) denote the number of items of type i ∈ I being packed in the kth bin. Consequently, the kth bin is entirely filled if and only if∑i=1mlixik≥Lholds.Remark 3Note that a direct transfer of the Kantorovich model to the skiving stock problem leads to the inequalities∑i=1mlixik≥Lykfor k ∈ K. Contrary to the CSP, in this formulation the caseyk=0entails a restriction which does not eliminate the possibility to fill the kth bin entirely.We suggest to tackle the problem mentioned in Remark 3 by introducing additional linear inequalities. Hence, we obtain a(32)Kantorovich−typemodeloftheSSPzK=∑k∈Kyk→maxs.t.∑k∈Kxik≤bi,i∈I,(33)∑i∈Ilixik≥Lyk,k∈K,(34)∑i∈Ilixik≤2Lyk,k∈K,(35)yk∈{0,1},k∈K,(36)xik∈Z+,i∈I,k∈K.Note that constraints (34) do not influence constraints (33) since all minimal patterns are still possible. This model possesses(1+m)uvariables andm+2uconstraints, i.e., a pseudo-polynomial number.Remark 41.Constraints (34) are necessary to cope with the feasible solutions of the model in a consistent way, cf. Remark 3. Nonetheless, omitting these additional restrictions has no influence on the optimal objective value of this model sinceyk=0and∑i=1mlixik≥Lfor some k ∈ K would contradict to the optimality.Obviously, this Kantorovich-type model is equivalent to the standard model since there is a canonical relationship between a (minimal) patternaj∈PE☆and the assignment of the items of a pattern to a bin k ∈ K. Note that, in general, this equivalence does not hold in the continuous case, see the subsequent proposition for more details.Unfortunately, this formulation contains two disadvantages: a weak continuous relaxation and a high number of symmetric solutions. Both of them might lead to additional expenses within numerical computations, especially, if branch and bound methods or related approaches are considered. In order to clarify these drawbacks, we state the following two results, but omit most parts of the proofs.Proposition 14The optimal value of the continuous relaxation of the Kantorovich-type model results to(zrelK)☆=u.Due to yk≤ 1 for all k ∈ K, the inequality(zrelK)☆≤uis clearly satisfied. The remaining part follows immediately from the feasibility of∀k∈K:yk=1,∀(i,k)∈I×K:xik=biu.□Note that, actually, this relaxation can be arbitrarily bad. Consider e.g.limb→∞,b∈NzrelK(Eb)−z☆(Eb)where z⋆(Eb) andzrelK(Eb)denote the optimal values of the SSP and the continuous relaxation of the Kantorovich-type model, respectively, andEb=(1,9,10,b)withb∈N.Proposition 15Let{yk}k∈K,{xik}(i,k)∈I×Kdenote a feasible solution of the Kantorovich-type model with objective value z. Let π be a permutation on{1,…,u}. Then,{y˜k}k∈K,{x˜ik}(i,k)∈I×Kwithy˜k=yπ(k)(k ∈ K) andx˜ik=xiπ(k)((i, k) ∈ I × K) represents a feasible solution with the same objective value. In particular, there are at least u! optimal solutions of the Kantorovich-type model.In order to avoid symmetries arising from permutations, the vectorsxk=(x1k,…,xmk)⊤∈Z+mwith k ∈ K are supposed to be ordered lexicographically decreasing, i.e., x1≽x2≽⋅⋅⋅≽xu. The following theorem shows how these additional constraints can be transformed into a set of linear inequalities by means of additional binary variables.Theorem 16LetM∈Nbe sufficiently large andv,w∈Z+mbe given. Then, the following assertions are equivalent:1.v≽w, i.e., the implication(37)〈∀j∈{1,…,i−1}:vj=wj〉⟹vi≥wiholds for all i ∈ I.The vectors v and w satisfy the systemA={A1(i),A2(i),A3(i)}i=1mof inequalities defined byA1(i):vi≤wi+Mdi,A2(i):vi≥wi+1−M(1−di),A3(i):wi≤vi+M·∑j=1i−1dj,for all i ∈ I wheredi∈Bis given bydi:={1ifvi>wi,0otherwisefor i ∈ I.We prove both implications separately:(i) ⟸ (ii) : Let d ∈ {0, 1}mbe a binary vector, such that v and w satisfy the systemA. We have to prove the validity of (37).(a)Fori=1assertion (37) is always satisfied due to A3(1).Leti∈{2,…,m}be given and letvj=wjhold for allj∈{1,…,i−1}. Then, A2(j) implies that djcannot takedj=1since this would lead tovj≥wj+1,in contrast to the assumptions. Consequently,dj=0has to hold forj∈{1,…,i−1}. Hence, vi≥ wifollows immediately from A3(i).(i) ⟹ (ii) : Let v≽w, i.e., property (37) holds for all i ∈ I. We defined∈Bmas above and prove that v and w satisfy the systemA:(a)At first, we consider the casei=1. Due to v≽w, we obtain v1 ≥ w1 resulting to condition A3(1). Assuming v1 > w1 we obtaind1=1leading tow1+Md1=w1+M≥v1andw1+1−M(1−d1)=w1+1≤v1,i.e., the inequalities A1(1) and A2(1) are satisfied. In the other case,v1=w1holds which is equal tod1=0. Hence, we havew1+Md1=w1=v1≥v1andw1+1−M(1−d1)=w1+1−M≤v1,i.e., the inequalities A1(1) and A2(1) are satisfied.Leti∈{2,…,m}be given. We distinguish two cases:Case 1:vj=wjholds for allj∈{1,…,i−1}.In this case,dj=0holds for allj∈{1,…,i−1}. Hence, (37) impliesvi+M·∑l=1i−1dl=vi+0=vi≥wiproving A3(i). Due to v≽w and the presumption of this first case, either vi> wiorvi=wihas to hold.From vi> wiwe havedi=1resulting towi+Mdi=wi+M≥viandwi+1−M(1−di)=wi+1≤vi,i.e., the assertions A1(i) and A2(i) are satisfied.Fromvi=wiwe havedi=0resulting towi+Mdi=wi=vi≥viandwi+1−M(1−di)=wi+1−M≤vi,i.e., the assertions A1(i) and A2(i) are satisfied.In each case the inequalities A1(i), A2(i) and A3(i) were proved to hold which completes the first case of this implication.Case 2: There existsj∈{1,…,i−1}with vj≠ wj.According to v≽w, there is some j such that vj> wj, i.e.,dj=1per definition, holds. Hence, we obtainvi+M·∑l=1i−1dl≥vi+M≥withat is inequality A3(i). Due to the presumption of this second case, the cases vi> wiand vi≤ wiare possible. At this point, we omit the corresponding calculations since they are essentially the same as in the first case. Thus, in each case the inequalities A1(i), A2(i) and A3(i) were proved to hold which completes the second case of this implication.Sincei∈{2,…,m}was arbitrarily chosen, systemAis satisfied by the vectors v, w and the binary vector d.□Thus, we can formulate our(38)LexicographicKantorovich−typemodeloftheSSPzK=∑k∈Kyk→maxs.t.∑k∈Kxik≤bi,i∈I,(39)∑i∈Ilixik≥Lyk,k∈K,(40)∑i∈Ilixik≤2Lyk,k∈K,(41)xik≤xi,k+1+Mdik,xik≥xi,k+1+1−M(1−dik),xi,k+1≤xik+M·∑j=1i−1djk,}i∈I,k=1,…,u−1,(42)yk∈{0,1},k∈K,(43)dik∈{0,1},i∈I,k=1,…,u−1,(44)xik∈Z+,i∈I,k∈K.This model containsm(u−1)additional binary variables and3m(u−1)additional linear constraints. The magnitude ofM∈Nhas to exceed the largest possible entry of xk(k ∈ K), i.e., due to (40), we could takeM=2·⌈L/lmin⌉+1where lminis the smallest item length of E.In order to compare the performances of the presented models we implemented them in MATLAB R2013a and used its CPLEX-interface (version 12.5.1) to solve all optimization problems but the continuous relaxation of the standard model. Due to the a priori unavailability of the explicit form of the constraints, this model had to be solved by a self-programmed column generation algorithm. Our computational environment was given by an Intel Core i5-2450M CPU with 2.50 gigahertz and 6 gigabytes RAM. As a first investigation, we selected the parameters(m,L)=(10,100)and solved 50 randomly generated instances where liand bi(i ∈ I) were chosen from uniformly distributed integer numbers in[L/10,L−1]and [1, 20], respectively. Since these examples are small to a certain extent, we limited the computation time to a maximum of 30 seconds and listed the results in Table 1. Thereby, the continuous relaxations of Kantorovich-type models have not been investigated since their optimal objective values can be computed directly.Note that the Kantorovich model could only cope with 39 instances, whereas the lexicographic Kantorovich model only handled 20 instances within the given time limitation (indicated by ⋆ in Table 1). Focusing on these solved instances, we obtain average computation times of 0.7917 sec and 13.1646 sec for the Kantorovich and the lexicographic Kantorovich model, respectively. Thus, even if a solution is found, both models are quite slow compared to the performances of the other ones. On the basis of our simulations, we would like to give two main reasons for the bad performance of these models. Table 2shows the average numbers of variables and constraints in the considered models.In these instance, cf. Table 2, the Kantorovich-type models possess significantly larger numbers of variables and constraints which, in many cases, lead to high additional computational expenses. Besides, CPLEX applies a solution method based on branch-and-bound-techniques that mainly depends on the availability of reasonably tight bounds. As we have seen in the theoretical part of this paper, the bounds derived from the continuous relaxation are weak in general. In our simulations, the absolute difference between the optimal value u of the continuous relaxation of the Kantorovich model and the optimal value z⋆ of the skiving stock problem was in the range of 1 up to 19, and its average value was 7.16. Moreover, the mean relative gap resulted to about 15 percent. Hence, in many cases, the bounds computed at the different nodes of the branching tree were too weak to reduce the number of open subproblems. Altogether, we would like to restrict our further investigations to the standard, the arcflow and the onestick model.Remark 5Note that the relationship between the numbers of variables and constraints in the different models depends on the given input-data. For instance, small values of bi(i ∈ I) are favorable for the Kantorovich approaches (since the availabilities influence the upper bound u), whereas they do not affect the arcflow model and the onestick model. Additionally, the size of the models of Section 3 is strongly connected with the absolute value L. In contrast, the size of the Kantorovich-type models only depends on the ratios li/L (i ∈ I). Therefore, we randomly generated 70 ”Kantorovich-tailored” instances withL=200,m=10and uniformly distributed integer numbers li∈ [L/10, L/4] and bi∈ [1, 10] with i ∈ I. The results can be seen in Table 3.Also in these instances, the Kantorovich-type models turn out not to be faster than the alternative approaches of Section 3, even though the input-data were chosen favorably for the models of Section 4. Hence, even if there are much smaller numbers of variables and constraints in the Kantorovich-type models they are, due to their very weak continuous relaxation, outperformed by the position-indexed and order-indexed approaches.In order to evaluate the influence of different parameters m and L on the average perfomances of our models, we randomly generated 100 instances for each selected pair(m,L)∈N×Nand listed their average computation times in Table 4. Here, liand bi(i ∈ I) were chosen from uniformly distributed integer numbers in[L/10,L−1]and [1, 200], respectively.Obviously, the average computation times of the continuous relaxation of the standard model are much higher than those ones of the other models which are certainly caused by the fact that a self-programmed algorithm is compared with CPLEX. Moreover, as observed in Valério de Carvalho (2005) and Ben Amor, Desrosiers, and Valério de Carvalho (2006), in column generation there might be a lot of degeneracy that stalls the simplex algorithm. Since this aspect would also be meaningful in an exact algorithm of the standard model we forbore from doing further research in this field.Observe that, in general, the average computation times of the position-indexed and order-indexed models are the higher the larger the parameters m and L are. This behavior is reasonable since both of them possessO(mL)variables andO(m+L)constraints which, in most cases, lead to additional computational expenses if m or L increases. In contrast, the average computation time of the continuous relaxation of the standard model only increases significantly in the case where m grows. In order to understand this fact, remember that each iteration of the column generation is mainly determined by two processes: a matrix inversion via the Sherman-Morrison formula with a complexity ofO(m2)and the solution of a covering problem by means of dynamic programming with a complexity ofO(mL). Due to the statement from Bazaraa, Jarvis, and Sherali (2005, chap. 5, p. 206)“Empirically, it is often suggested that on the average in most instances, the simplex method requires roughly on the order of m to 3m iterations.”we assume that, on average, there are 3m iterations leading to a total complexity of aboutO(m3+m2L). Thus, the influence of the parameter m on the average computation time is expected to be higher than the influence of L.Unfortunately, these instances are too small to clearly notice the predicted relationship between the computation times of the arcflow and the onestick model. We therefore generated and solved, in each case, 50 instances for some larger values of m and L under the same conditions as above. Additionally, we listed the average numbers of variables and restrictions of the respective models in Table 5in order to get an empirical impression of the benefit being based on the presented reduction principles.These simulations show, especially for(m,L)=(100,2000),that the average computation time of the arcflow model is slightly higher than those ones of the onestick model. Furthermore, note that the differences between the respective average numbers of variables or constraints always equal m. Thus, our theoretical results and predictions of Section 3.5 can also be observed in these computational data. Additionally, we want to underline the large differences between the average number of variables (or constraints) and the theoretical worst-case-value mL (orm+L). Considering, by way of example, the simulations of the arcflow model for(m,L)=(100,500),the average number of variables corresponds to only about 22.75 percent and the number of constraints is about 82 percent of the theoretical worst case complexity mL andm+L,respectively. Thus, the reduction techniques presented in Section 3 effect high economies as regards the complexity of the models since they significantly lessen the numbers of variables and restrictions.Note that in all these simulations we only considered the times to solve the respective models of the skiving stock problems. Actually, the total computation times are higher since the alternative formulations require additional time for necessary precalculations before the solution procedure can be applied. For instance, such initializations are given by the construction of potential allocation points, variable and constraint reductions (as described in Section 3) and the definition of the corresponding vectors and matrices for the objective function and the set of restrictions. In order to get an overview on how the total computation times change with respect to different choices of m and L, we generated 50 instances with uniformly distributed input-data li∈ [L/10, 3L/4] and bi∈ [1, 100] for each pair (m, L). Therefore, Table 6lists the same data (i.e., t, trel, nconand nvar) as the previous one, but now we also report on the computation time tmodneeded for the model generation itself.First of all, observe that these randomly generated instances were much harder than the previous ones which, in particular, can be seen by the greater average number of variables and the (slightly) greater average number of constraints. In some extent, this is due to the fact that we excluded very large item lengths li> 3L/4 which potentially leads to a larger variety of possible combinations between the single items. Thereby, the number of potential allocation points, as well as the number of arcs and onesticks is likely to increase which leads to more variables and constraints. According to this observation, for the same parameters (m, L), we needed more time to solve the problems compared to the instances of Table 5. Again, the pure solution times of the arcflow model and the onestick model are quite similar, but in most cases the performance of the onestick model tends to be slightly better.Furthermore, note that both models require approximately the same time tmodas regards the model generation itself. Only in the case of very large instances, i.e., for(m,L)=(100,2000),a minor difference between the total computation timestmod+tof both formulations can be noticed. From our point of view, this behavior is quite natural since, in general, the precalculations for the onestick model are a little bit more complex. For instance, the index set of the variables of the onestick modelM′contains an additional condition (namely p ≥ 2q), that has to be ensured, compared to the setE′′of the arcflow model. Moreover, in the onestick model, we need to precalculate the vector N for the right hand side of the constraints. As our computations show, for very large instances, these additional expenses can be larger than the savings arising from the lower number of variables and constraints. However, for instances of moderate sizes, both alternative models can be considered as equivalent from the computational point of view.Remark 6Note that the method of randomly-generated instances can be generalized to so-called problem generators. For example, such an approach is presented in Gau and Wäscher (1995) for the one-dimensional cutting stock problem. As regards the generation of the item lengths we are working quite close to the construction proposed in that paper. However, a main difference is given by the fact that we also kept the values of bifully randomly. In particular, we did not fix∑i=1mbias it was done in Gau and Wäscher (1995).As we have stated in Section 3, for a given instance E, the absolute difference (called gap)Δ(E)=zrel☆(E)−z☆(E)between the optimal objective values of the continuous relaxation and the integer problem is the same for the standard model, the arc-flow model and the onestick model. This result could also be observed in our simulations. Note that in Zak (2003) it is conjectured that Δ(E) < 2 holds for all instances of the skiving stock problem. Therefore, for the 450 instances of Table 6, we also computed the gap and obtained the (rough) distribution of Table 7.Obviously, our results do not violate the conjecture of Zak, since, in particular, we did not even find any instance with gap Δ(E) ≥ 1. However, a thorough computational study or theoretical investigation of the gap of the skiving stock problem would go beyond the aim of this paper. We would like to refer the reader to Martinovic and Scheithauer (2015) for more information as regards this topic.In this paper, we gave an introduction to the topic of the skiving stock problem by presenting a new position-indexed model, a new order-indexed model and one assignment model which only require a pseudo-polynomial number of variables and constraints. Hence, these formulations are, in particular, suitable to cope with instances of practical meaningful sizes. We further applied several reduction or improvement techniques to the different models in order to reduce their computational expenses. As a main contribution, we proved the equivalence of the standard, the arcflow and the onestick model, especially in the case where the respective continuous relaxations are considered. Additionally, we compared the presented models by means of theoretical and numerical investigations and showed, as a main contribution, that the onestick model requires fewer computational expenses than the arcflow model as regards the pure solution time.Since the alternative models require additional time for their initialization, we did further research on the total computation times of the arcflow model and the onestick model. Thereby, both models turned out to have a similar running time, in most cases. Only for very large instances, small differences in favor of the arcflow model could be noticed. Our results also give reason to investigate solution methods and exact algorithms for the standard model since this model does almost not depend on any precalculations.It will be part of our future research to develop models for the description of multidimensional generalizations of the skiving stock problem. Thereby, also necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-overlapping multidimensional patterns are of high interest. Additionally, due to the equivalence of the standard model, the position-indexed formulation and the order-indexed approach, further investigations on the gap of this optimization problem will be a main objective of our research.
