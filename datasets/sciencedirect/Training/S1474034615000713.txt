@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Facing fierce competition in marketplaces, companies try to determine the optimal settings of design attribute of new products from which the best customer satisfaction can be obtained. To determine the settings, customer satisfaction models relating affective responses of customers to design attributes have to be first developed. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) was attempted in previous research and shown to be an effective approach to address the fuzziness of survey data and nonlinearity in modeling customer satisfaction for affective design. However, ANFIS is incapable of modeling the relationships that involve a number of inputs which may cause the failure of the training process of ANFIS and lead to the ‘out of memory’ error. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, rough set (RS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based-ANFIS approaches are proposed to model customer satisfaction for affective design and further improve the modeling accuracy. In the approaches, the RS theory is adopted to extract significant design attributes as the inputs of ANFIS and PSO is employed to determine the parameter settings of an ANFIS from which explicit customer satisfaction models with better modeling accuracy can be generated. A case study of affective design of mobile phones is used to illustrate the proposed approaches. The modeling results based on the proposed approaches are compared with those based on ANFIS, fuzzy least-squares regression (FLSR), fuzzy regression (FR), and genetic programming-based fuzzy regression (GP-FR). Results of the training and validation tests show that the proposed approaches perform better than the others in terms of training and validation errors.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Affective design has been shown to excite psychological feelings of customers and can help improve the emotional aspects of customer satisfaction. It is an important design strategy to enhance customer satisfaction of new products in customer-driven product development. Design attributes, such as shape and color, evoke the affective responses of customers to products. Products with good affective design can help attract customers and influence their choices and preferences, such as loyalty and joy of use [1,2]. The process of affective design includes identifying, measuring, analyzing, and understanding the relationship between the affective needs of the customer domain and the perceptual design attributes in the design domain [3]. One of the major processes of affective design is to determine the design attributes settings of new products such that high, or even optimal, customer affective satisfaction of the new products can be obtained. To determine the design attribute settings, customer satisfaction models that relate affective responses of customers to design attributes have to be developed first. However, the modeling process is quite complex as the relationships to be modeled can be highly nonlinear and fuzzy. Modeling customer satisfaction for affective product design has been applied in the industry for various product designs, such as the design of vehicle interior [4], office chairs [5], mobile phones [6], and digital camera [7].A handful of studies previously attempted to model the relationships between affective responses and design attributes using statistical and artificial intelligence methods. Artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed to model the affective relationship in product design [8,9]. An interactive evolutionary system based on neural networks was proposed to analyze the aesthetic perceptions of customers and approximate their aesthetic intentions [10]. Chen et al. developed a prototype system for affective design in which Kohonen’s self-organizing map neural network was employed to consolidate the relationships between design attributes and affective dimensions [11]. The main advantage of the ANN is the development of models through learning from data without requiring prior knowledge. Although a trained ANN can possibly provide an accurate prediction or classification, it is known as a ‘black box’ model from which no explicit knowledge of the relationships can be obtained [12].Multiple linear regression has been used to model affective relationships [13]. The approach is easy to apply, but it assumes that the design attributes in the regression are linear, and the effect of an independent design attribute is the same throughout the entire range of the affective response. A decision support system has been proposed to provide guidelines for optimizing affective satisfaction based on principal component analysis and multiple regression [14]. Petiot and Grognet [15] proposed an explicit modeling method based on a vector field to model affective relationships. You et al. [16] developed the customer satisfaction models for automotive interior material using quantification I analysis. Based on the models, the significance of the design attributes can be identified. Han et al. [17] attempted to evaluate product usability based on statistical regression models that relate usability dimensions and design attributes. However, the above statistical approaches are unable to address the fuzziness involved in the affective responses of customers.To address the fuzziness of affective modeling, Park and Han proposed a fuzzy rule-based approach to examine customer satisfaction towards office chair designs [18]. They reported that the fuzzy rule-based approach outperformed the multiple linear regression approaches in terms of the number of design attributes to be considered in modeling. A fuzzy expert system with gradient descent optimization was proposed to develop models that relate affective responses to design attributes in fashion product development [19]. Shimizu and Jindo [4] applied a fuzzy regression method to model the relationship between design attributes and affective responses to address the fuzziness of human sensations towards vehicle interior design. Tanaka’s fuzzy regression approach was proposed to model customer satisfaction for improving the design of driver seat [20]. However, the fuzzy regression approach is unable to capture nonlinearity of the modeling. Chan et al. introduced genetic programming into fuzzy regression for modeling affective relationships [6]. An evolutionary algorithm was used to construct branches of a tree representing the structures of a model where the nonlinearity of the model could be addressed and the fuzzy regression was then used to determine the fuzzy coefficients of the model. The limitation of this approach is that the size of the search space increases exponentially with the number of nodes and the tree depth.The hybrid approaches of fuzzy logic and ANN combine the capability of fuzzy logic in the linguistic representation of knowledge and the adaptive learning capability of ANN for automatic generation and optimization of a fuzzy inference system. Fuzzy neural networks have been introduced to establish the relationships between design attributes and consumer affections [21]. Fuzzy neural networks utilize a series of output nodes of the ANN to emulate a fuzzy membership grade of affection intensity and then determine the aggregate value of customer affection through defuzzification. Hsiao and Tsai [22] proposed a method that enables an automatic product form or product image evaluation by means of a neural network-based fuzzy reasoning and genetic algorithm, which was applied to establish relationships between the design attributes of a new product and the customers’ affective image. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was examined by Kwong and Wong [23] to generate explicit customer satisfaction models which can capture the nonlinearity and fuzziness existing in the modeling. Compared with ANN, a set of fuzzy if-then rules with appropriate membership functions and the internal models can be generated based on ANFIS to stipulate input–output pairs explicitly. However, the conventional learning algorithms for ANFIS are gradient descent, in which the calculation of gradients in each step is difficult and the use of chain rules may cause a local minimum. These issues have been shown to affect modeling accuracy. On the other hand, ANFIS is not suitable for the modeling problems that involve a number of inputs. If the number of inputs is large, the number of generated fuzzy rules increases exponentially. These increases would cause long computational time and even execution errors. To overcome the limitation and further improve modeling accuracy of ANFIS, in this paper, rough set (RS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based ANFIS approaches are proposed to modeling customer satisfaction for affective design.The organization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes how the proposed approaches are used to model customer satisfaction for affective design. In Section 3, a case study of mobile phone design is described to illustrate the proposed approaches. The validation of the proposed approaches is shown in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.To address the deficiency of ANFIS for modeling affective relationships, RS and PSO-based ANFIS approaches are proposed in this research. Since ANFIS is incapable for application in those modeling problems that involve a number of attributes, in the proposed approaches, RS theory is introduced to reduce the number of inputs and determine indispensable design attributes for generating customer satisfaction models. The PSO-based ANFIS approach is introduced to develop nonlinear customer satisfaction models, in which PSO is used to determine the optimal values of antecedent parameters in membership functions, such that the errors between the predictive customer satisfaction values and the actual customer satisfaction values can be minimized. Fig. 1shows a flowchart of the proposed approaches to modeling customer satisfaction for affective design.ANFIS is a multilayer feed-forward network in which the neural network is regarded as a learning algorithm and fuzzy reasoning is used to map inputs into an output [24]. It is a fuzzy inference system implemented in the framework of adaptive neural networks. Fig. 2shows the architecture of a typical ANFIS with two inputs and one output. To facilitate an illustration of the mathematical aspect of ANFIS, each input of ANFIS is assumed to have two linguistic descriptions. In fact, if more linguistic descriptions are involved, the process of ANFIS is still the same but the ANFIS structure would be more complex as the numbers of nodes in the layers 1 to 3 increase correspondingly.If both inputs,x1andx2, have two linguistic descriptions (e.g., low and high), a membership function is used to represent each description. Hence,μi(x1)denotes the membership function for the ith linguistic description ofx1, andλj(x2)denotes the membership function of the jth linguistic description ofx2, wherei=1,2andj=1,2. Thus, four membership functions are available for all inputs as defined by the four nodes in Layer 1 (L1). Different types of membership functions such as triangular, trapezoidal, Gaussian, bell-shaped, sigmoidal and polynomial based membership function with symmetrical shape and equal spread were compared in previous studies and the results indicated that triangular membership function could perform more effectively and provided better accuracy than the other membership functions in a fuzzy system [25]. Triangular-shaped membership functions have consistency property and are easier to perform fuzzy arithmetic [26]. Therefore, in this research, triangular-shaped membership functions are adopted and defined below.(1)μi(x1)=x1-aibi-aiai⩽x1⩽bici-x1ci-bibi⩽x1⩽ci0Otherwiseandλj(x2)=x2-sjtj-sjsj⩽x2⩽tjuj-x2uj-tjtj⩽x2⩽uj0Otherwisewhere(ai,bi,ci)and(si,ti,ui)are triangular fuzzy numbers. The parameters in this layer are referred to as antecedent parametersAt L2, one rule is used to denote the outcome for each combination ofx1andx2. Hence, the total number of rules is 2×2=4. The fuzzy rules can be generally expressed as follows:(2)Rij:IFx1isμiANDx2isλj,THENfij=pijx1+qijx2+rijwherepij,qij, andrijare the parameters of the internal modelsfijof the fuzzy rulesRijand they are consequent parameters. The outputs of this layer are described as follows:(3)wij=μi(x1)·λj(x2)(∀i=1,2,j=1,2)wherewijrepresents the firing strength of each fuzzy rule. The firing strength indicates the degree to whichRijis satisfied. The connection weight between L2 and L3 isw¯ijas defined by (4), which is the normalized firing strength. The larger the value ofw¯ijimplies thatRijis more significant.(4)w¯ij=wijWwhereW=∑i∑jwij(∀i=1,2,j=1,2)At L3, the internal model ofRijis a first-order Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model [27] as defined by (5).(5)fij=pijx1+qijx2+rij(∀i=1,2,j=1,2)At L4, a single node is used to compute the overall output as the summation of all incoming signals. The mathematical formulation of the node is defined by (6).(6)y=∑i=12∑j=12Oij=∑i=12∑j=12w¯ij·fij=∑i=12∑j=12w¯ij·(pijx1+qijx2+rij)From (6), explicit models can be generated by combining of all the normalized firing strengths and the corresponding internal models of all the fuzzy rules. The learning algorithm of an ANFIS is to determine the parameters(ai,bi,ci),(si,ti,ui), and(pij,qij,rij), such that the error between the ANFIS output and the training data can be minimized.Attribute reduction is a process of finding an optimal subset of all attributes following certain criteria so that the attribute subset is sufficient to represent the classification relation of data. A proper choice of attribute subsets can reduce the input number of ANFIS, thus simplify its structure, and shorten computational time. The RS theory was proposed by Pawlak [28], which is based on equivalence relations or indiscernibility in the classification of objects. The approximation space of a RS is the classification of the domain of interest into disjoint categories [29]. RS theory handles inconsistent information using two approximations, the upper and lower approximations. The upper and lower approximations represent the indiscernible object classifications that possess sharp descriptions on concepts but with no sharp boundaries.A design table with 4-tuple can be expressed asS=(U,Q,V,ρ), where U is the universe that is a finite and non-empty set of object; Q is a finite set of attributes;V=∪q∈QVq, whereVqis a domain of the attribute q; The information function isρ:U×Q→V, such thatρ(s,q)∈Vqfor everyq∈Q,s∈U, and∃(q,v), whereq∈Qandv∈Vqare descriptions of S.Assuming a subset of the set of attributes,R∈Q, two objects,x,y∈U, are indiscernible with respect to R if and only ifρ(x,r)=ρ(y,r)for∃r∈R. The indiscernibility relation, which is the equivalence relation defined on set U, is written asind(R).ind(R)partitions the universe U into disjoint subsets, andU/ind(R)is used to denote these partitions of U. The lower and upper approximation of a setY⊆Ucan be defined as follows:(7)R̲Y=∪{X:X∈U/ind(R),X⊆Y}(8)R‾Y=∪{X:X∈U/ind(R),X∩Y≠ϕ}whereR̲Yconsists of all objects in U that certainly belong toY,andR‾Yconsists of all objects in U that possibly belong to Y under the equivalent relation R.Elements belonging only to the upper approximation compose the boundary region (BN)or the doubtful area. It represents the area which cannot be certainly classified into Y or to its complement. Mathematically, a boundary region can be expressed as follows:(9)BN(Y)=R‾Y-R̲YThe positive regionPosR(Y)and the negative regionNegR(Y)of Y on R are defined by (10) and (11), respectively.(10)PosR(Y)=R̲Y(11)NegR(Y)=U-PosR(Y)Based on the above definitions, attribute reduction is defined as follows:If R is a set of equivalent relation,r∈R, andPosR(Y)≠PosR-{r}(Y), namely,ind(R)≠ind(R-{r}),Ris the independent attribute and r is the indispensable attribute in R, otherwise r is dispensable.If R is independent,R⊆Pandind(R)=ind(P),Ris a reduction ofP,R∈RED(P).RED(P)represents the set of all the attribute reductions of P. The intersection ofRED(P)is the core of P, which is expressed asCore(P).The number of each design attribute appearing in the attribute reductions reflects the importance of each design attribute. A larger number implies that the corresponding design attribute is more important. Based on the numbers, ranking of the design attributes can be performed and the top ranking attributes are selected as the inputs of the PSO-based ANFIS.The learning algorithm of an ANFIS aims to determine the antecedent and consequent parameters such that the error between the ANFIS output and the actual output can be minimized. Jang proposed a hybrid learning algorithm which is composed of a forward pass and a backward pass to complete training and updating in an adaptive network [30]. Referring to the ANFIS structure (Fig. 2), given the values of antecedent parameters, the overall output can be expressed as a linear combination of the consequent parameters as follows:(12)y=∑i=12∑j=12w¯ij(pijx1+qijx2+rij)=w¯11(p11x1+q11x2+r11)+w¯12(p12x1+q12x2+r12)+w¯21(p21x1+q21x2+r21)+w¯22(p22x1+q22x2+r22)=(w¯11x1)p11+(w¯11x2)q11+(w¯11)r11+(w¯12x1)p12+(w¯12x2)q12+(w¯12)r12+(w¯21x1)p21+(w¯21x2)q21+(w¯21)r21+(w¯22x1)p22+(w¯22x2)q22+(w¯22)r22=AθwhereA=(w¯11x1,w¯11x2,w¯11,w¯12x1,w¯12x2,w¯12,w¯21x1,w¯21x2,w¯21,w¯22x1,w¯22x2,w¯22)and θ is a vector of the consequent parameters (p11,q11,r11,p12,q12,r12,p21,q21,r21,p22,q22,r22). The number of the consequent parameters of (12) is 12. If there are t training data sets, the dimensions ofA,θ, and y aret×12,12×1, andt×1, respectively.In the forward pass, the antecedent parameters are fixed, and the input signals go forward to calculate each node output until matrix A in (12) is obtained. The consequent parameters are then determined using the least square estimation (LSE) method. An LSE value ofθ,θ̂, aims at minimizing the squared errorAθ-y2, which is calculated based on the following formulations.(13)θ̂i+1=θ̂i+Si+1ai+1(bi+1T-ai+1Tθ̂i)1+ai+1TSi+1ai+1(14)Si+1=Si-Siai+1ai+1TSi1+ai+1TSiai+1whereaiTis the ith row vector of matrixA;biTis the ith element ofy,i=1,…,t;Siis the covariance matrix andS0=γI;γis a positive large number; and I is the identity matrix with a12×12dimension.The predictive outputŷof ANFIS is obtained based on the identified value ofθ̂.(15)ŷ=Aθ̂In the backward pass, the error rates propagate backward, and the antecedent parameters are updated. The conventional algorithm for updating the antecedent parameters is the gradient descent method. However, it is very difficult to determine the best learning rate in the gradient descent method, and the convergence of antecedent parameters based on the method is slow. In this study, a PSO algorithm is introduced to determine and update the antecedent parameters. PSO has a high degree of stability and has been demonstrated to have fast convergence. It does not rely on the derivative nature of objective function and can achieve global optimization by comparing objective function values time after time.PSO is a popular search algorithm based on the social behavior of a bird flock [31]. In PSO, every potential solution of the optimization problem can be imagined as being a point in a D-dimensional search space. This point is called a ‘particle’. Particles fly in search space with a certain speed, which is dynamically adjusted according to its own and its companions’ flight experience. Every particle has a fitness value determined by the objective function and knows its current position and its own current best position,pbest. Thepbestcan be seen as the particle’s own flying experience. In addition, every particle also knows the global best positiongbest, which has the best value inpbest. Thegbestcan be seen as its companions’ flying experience for the particle. Every particle uses the following information to change their current location: (1) the current location; (2) the current speed; (3) the distance between the current location and its own best location; and (4) the distance between the current location and the global best location. The optimization search is achieved by the iteration of a particle swarm which is formed by a group of random initialized particles.A swarm is composed of m particles flying in the D-dimension in a certain speed. Every particle changes its position based on considering its own historical best position and other particles’ historical best position. The position for the ith particle isxi=(xi1,xi2,…,xid), where1⩽i⩽mand1⩽d⩽D. D is the dimension of the search space as well as the number of antecedent parameters. The speed for the ith particle isvi=(vi1,vi2,…,vid). The historical best position of the ith particle, which has the minimum fitness value, ispi=(pi1,pi2,…,pid). The best positiongbestfor the whole swarm ispg=(pj1,pj2,…,pjd),j∈1,2,…,m. The final result ofpgdenotes the optimal values of the antecedent parameters. The process of updating the speed and the position of the particle based on the idea of inertia weight [32] is expressed as follows:(16)vidk+1=ωvidk+c1r1(pidk-xidk)+c2r2(pjdk-xidk)(17)xidk+1=xidk+vidk+1wherevidkandxidkare the speed vector and the position vector of the ith particle at the kth iteration, respectively; k is the number of iterations; w is the inertia weight, the value of which decides the quantity inherited from the current speed of the particle;c1andc2are learning factors and are usually set as 2; The values ofr1andr2are randomly chosen from the range0,1.The processes of modeling customer satisfaction for affective design based on the proposed approaches are shown as follows:Step 1: A customer survey is designed and conducted to obtain affective responses of customers on products.Step 2: Once survey data is obtained, the values of the affective responses are discretized and used as the outputs. Based on the survey data, RS theory is introduced to identify redundant attributes and generate a list of attribute reductions.Step 3: Based on the list of the attribute reductions, the number of each design attribute appearing in the list is calculated. The ranking for all the design attributes is obtained based on the number and the important design attributes are then selected as the inputs of PSO-based ANFIS.Step 4: Using the extracted design attributes as the inputs, the ANFIS is trained by the hybrid learning algorithm of PSO and LSE. The initialization for a particle swarm is first conducted, including iteration number, swarm size, dimension of search space, search range and learning factors. The speed and position of each particle are initialized randomly.Step 5: In the first iteration, the initial position of every particle is used as the initial individual best positionpb, and the position vector of each particle is used as the antecedent parameters of ANFIS in sequence. The initial iteration is followed by calculating the values of membership functionsμiandλj, the firing strengthwij, and the normalized firing strengthw‾ijusing (1), (3), and (4), respectively. Based on the input data sets and the initial values of the consequent parameters, the values of the fuzzy rulefijare determined based on (5). Therefore, the outputs of all nodes reach L4. The final output y is then obtained using (6). LSE is used to identify the consequent parametersθ̂using (13) and (14). The identifiedθ̂and the matrix A in (12) are then used to compute for the value of the predictive outputŷbased on (15). Next, the mean absolute percentage error (ME)between the model outputŷand the actual value for the ith particle is calculated, which is also the fitness valueMEi1of the ith particle in the first iteration.MEi1is recorded as the initial individual best fitness valuepbest. The particle which has the smallest value inMEi1is selected as the best particle. The particle’s position vector is defined as the initial global best positionpg, and its fitness value is defined as the initial global best fitness valuegbest.Step 6: The iteration is continued byn+1→n. In each iteration, the speed vectorvidn+1and the position vectorxidn+1for each particle are updated based on (16) and (17), respectively. Then, theMEinof the ith particle in the nth iteration is calculated based on the updated position of particles. The current fitness valueMEinis compared withpbestfor each particle. If the value ofMEinis smaller thanpbest, the individual best fitness valuepbestis set as the value ofMEin, and the particle’s individual optimal position along with its new positionpb=xidnare updated.Step 7: The iteration stops when the pre-defined number of iterations is satisfied. The global best fitness valuegbestis updated by selecting the smallest value inpbestand the number of the best particle is then recorded. The global best positionpgis decided as the position of the selected best particle. The values ofpgare the identified antecedent parameters and the values ofθ̂are the identified consequent parameters.Step 8: Based on the antecedent and consequent parameters, the customer satisfaction models can be obtained using (1), (3), (4), and (6). The fuzzy rules are generated based on (2).A case study of mobile phone design is used in this study to illustrate the proposed approaches to model the relationships between affective responses and design attributes. A total of 32 mobile phones of various brands were selected. Morphological analysis was used to study the representative attributes of mobile phones as numerical data sets. Table 1shows the nine representative design attributes: top shape, bottom shape, side shape, function button shape, number buttons style, screen size, thickness, layout, and weight, which are denoted asx1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8, andx9, respectively. Design attributes have different numbers of form which range from 3 to 6. Four affective dimensions were used to evaluate the affective design of the mobile phones. They are simple–complex (S–C), unique–general (U–G), high-tech–classic (H–C), and handy–bulky (H–B), which are denoted asy1,y2,y3andy4, respectively. A survey was conducted using a questionnaire, in which a five-point scale was used to assess the mobile phone appearance corresponding to the four affective dimensions. Design profiles of the samples and the means of the affective responses of respondents to the S–C, U–G, H–C, and H–B of the samples are shown in Table 2.With the survey data, Rosetta software was employed to extract important design attributes. Rosetta is a toolkit for analyzing tabular data within the framework of RS theory and can be used to support the overall data mining and knowledge discovery process including initial browsing and preprocessing of the data, computation of minimal attribute sets, generation of descriptive patterns, and validation [33]. The previous research has shown that genetic algorithm based RS approach can obtain reducts effectively with high classification accuracy and derive larger number of reducts [34]. Therefore, in this study, the genetic reducer in Rosetta is used to conduct attributes reduction. The set of attribute reductions for S–C obtained from the software is shown in Table 3. The numbers for design attributesx1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7,x8, andx9are 14, 11, 18, 13, 9, 19, 14, 10, and 17, respectively. Based on the numbers, the ranking of importance of the design attributes isx6>x3>x9>x7=x1>x4>x2>x8>x5. Similarly, the ranking results of the nine design attributes for U–G, H–C, and H–B arex1>x7>x5=x4=x3>x6=x2>x9=x8,x1>x3>x7=x5>x9=x4>x8=x6=x2, andx9>x7>x4>x5=x1>x2>x6=x3>x8, respectively.In order to determine the number of inputs, the first two, three and four design attributes in the ranking were selected as inputs to model customer satisfaction. Using S–C as an example, if the number of inputs is two, the input attributes arex3andx6. The general form ofwijandw¯ijcan be expressed by (1), (3), and (4), as follows:(18)wij=aijx3x6+bijx3+cijx6+dij(19)w¯ij=aijx3x6+bijx3+cijx6+dijW=∑i=13∑j=13(aij)x3x6+∑i=13∑j=13(bij)x3+∑i=13∑j=13(cij)x6+∑i=13∑j=13(dij)whereaij=1(bi-ai)(tj-sj)ai⩽x3⩽biandsj⩽x6⩽tj-1(bi-ai)(uj-tj)ai⩽x3⩽biandtj⩽x6⩽uj-1(ci-bi)(tj-sj)bi⩽x3⩽ciandsj⩽x6⩽tj1(ci-bi)(uj-tj)bi⩽x3⩽ciandtj⩽x6⩽uj0otherwisebij=-sj(bi-ai)(tj-sj)ai⩽x3⩽biandsj⩽x6⩽tjuj(bi-ai)(uj-tj)ai⩽x3⩽biandtj⩽x6⩽ujsj(ci-bi)(tj-sj)bi⩽x3⩽ciandsj⩽x6⩽tj-uj(ci-bi)(uj-tj)bi⩽x3⩽ciandtj⩽x6⩽uj0otherwisecij=-ai(bi-ai)(tj-sj)ai⩽x3⩽biandsj⩽x6⩽tjai(bi-ai)(uj-tj)ai⩽x3⩽biandtj⩽x6⩽ujci(ci-bi)(tj-sj)bi⩽x3⩽ciandsj⩽x6⩽tj-ci(ci-bi)(uj-tj)bi⩽x3⩽ciandtj⩽x6⩽uj0otherwisedij=aisj(bi-ai)(tj-sj)ai⩽x3⩽biandsj⩽x6⩽tj-aiuj(bi-ai)(uj-tj)ai⩽x3⩽biandtj⩽x6⩽uj-cisj(ci-bi)(tj-sj)bi⩽x3⩽ciandsj⩽x6⩽tjciuj(ci-bi)(uj-tj)bi⩽x3⩽ciandtj⩽x6⩽uj0otherwiseGiven that(20)Oij=w¯ij·fij=(aijx3x6+bijx3+cijx6+dij)(pijx3+qijx6+rij)W=aijpij(x3)2x6+aijqijx3(x6)2+bijpij(x3)2+cijqij(x6)2+(cijpij+bijqij+aijrij)x3x6+(dijpij+bijrij)x3+(dijqij+cijrij)x6+dijrijWThe customer satisfaction model for S–C can be formulated by (5), as follows:(21)y=∑i=13∑j=13Oij=∑i=13∑j=13w¯ij·fij=AP(x3)2x6+AQx3(x6)2+BP(x3)2+CQ(x6)2+(CP+BQ+AR)x3x6+(DP+BR)x3+(DQ+CR)x6+DRAx3x6+Bx3+Cx6+DwhereAP=∑i=13∑j=13aijpij,AQ=∑i=13∑j=13aijqij,BP=∑i=13∑j=13bijpij,CQ=∑i=13∑j=13cijqij,CP=∑i=13∑j=13cijpij,BQ=∑i=13∑j=13bijqij,AR=∑i=13∑j=13aijrij,DP=∑i=13∑j=13dijpij,BR=∑i=13∑j=13bijrij,DQ=∑i=13∑j=13dijqij,CR=∑i=13∑j=13cijrij,DR=∑i=13∑j=13dijrij,A=∑i=13∑j=13aij,B=∑i=13∑j=13bij,C=∑i=13∑j=13cij,D=∑i=13∑j=13dijIn this study, triangular-shaped membership functions are used. Both inputs have three linguistic descriptions: small, medium, and large. The parameter settings of the proposed approaches for two inputs, three inputs and four inputs are shown in Table 4. Using the two inputs as an example, six sets of the antecedent parameters(ai,bi,ci)are available and the number of antecedent parameters to be identified is 6×3=18. The number of fuzzy rules is 3×3=9, and the number of consequent parameters to be trained is 9×3=27. The size of the particle swarm was set as 30. The number of dimensions of the search space for PSO is 18, which is equal to the number of the antecedent parameters. The iteration number is directly related to the search time which was determined as 200 through the repeated operations to make sure that the least number of iterations and the proper search range can be obtained. The upper and lower values of the inertia weight w are 0.9 and 0.1, respectively. The learning factorsc1andc2were set as 2. The proposed approaches were implemented using a Matlab software package to generate models that relate affective responses and the design attributes. Assuming that the values of the inputs belong to the left range of the membership function, the generated S–C models with two inputs, three inputs and four inputs are obtained as shown in (22)–(24), respectively.(22)y1=0.1170(x3)2x6-0.1421x3(x6)2-0.1561(x3)2+1.6626(x6)2+1.0187x3x6-0.8097x3+0.4499x6+0.02690.3900x3x6-0.3870x3-0.4065x6+0.4035(23)y1=0.0228x3(x6)2x9-0.0171(x3)2x6x9+0.0058x3x6(x9)2+0.0541(x6)2x9+0.3443x3(x6)2+0.0005(x3)2x9+0.0098(x3)2x6+0.0216x6(x9)2-0.0040x3(x9)2+0.1790x3x6x9+0.8213(x6)2+0.0028(x3)2+0.0009(x9)2+0.3974x6x9-0.9325x3x6-0.2384x3x9-0.1120x6+0.5569x3-0.1383x9-0.07550.0742x3x6x9-0.0829x3x9-0.0941x6x9-0.0740x3x6+0.1051x9+0.0828x3+0.0939x6-0.1049(24)y1=0.0019x3(x6)2x7x9+0.0007(x3)2x6x7x9-0.0020x3x6x7(x9)2+0.0021x3x6(x7)2x9+0.0232(x6)2x7x9+0.0299x3(x6)2x7+0.0021x3(x6)2x9-0.0039(x3)2x7x9+0.0660(x3)2x6x7-0.0016(x3)2x6x9-0.0019x3x7(x9)2+0.0177x6x7(x9)2-0.0108x3x6(x9)2-0.0009x3(x7)2x9+0.0276x6(x7)2x9+0.0271x3x6(x7)2+0.0198x3x6x7x9+0.3469(x6)2x7+0.0304(x6)2x9+0.0524x3(x6)2-0.0111(x3)2x7-0.0049(x3)2x9+0.0819(x3)2x6+0.0142x7(x9)2-0.0010x3(x9)2-0.0730x6(x9)2-0.0055(x7)2x9-0.0074x3(x7)2+0.2745x6(x7)2+0.3810x6x7x9+0.1925x3x6x7-0.0525x3x6x9-0.0443x3x7x9+0.4586x6x7-0.7456x6x9+0.3896x3x6-0.3440x3x7-0.0459x3x9-0.0566x7x9+0.6697(x6)2-0.0124(x3)2+0.0418(x9)2-0.0896(x7)2-0.0962x6-0.5378x3+0.2785x9-0.2842x7-0.11670.0656x3x6x7x9-0.0581x3x7x9-0.0635x6x7x9-0.0714x3x6x7-0.0699x3x6x9+0.0562x7x9+0.0633x3x7+0.0692x6x7+0.0619x3x9+0.0677x6x9+0.0762x3x6-0.0612x7-0.0600x9-0.0675x3-0.0738x6+0.0653To compare the modeling results based on the two inputs, three inputs and four inputs, ME and variance of errors (VoE)were adopted, as defined by (25) and (26), respectively.(25)ME=1t∑k=1tyk̂-ykyk·100(26)VoE=1t-1∑k=1tyk̂-ykyk·100-ME2where t is the number of data sets.yk̂is the kth predictive output based on the identified model andykis the kth actual output based on the survey data.The training errors and structure of the generated models are compared in Table 5. From the table, it can be seen that the values of ME and VoE for two inputs, three inputs and four inputs all are very small and have the same order of magnitude. However, the number of terms of the generated models based on the four inputs and three inputs are five times and two times more than that with two inputs, respectively. On the other hand, the number of fuzzy rules generated for the four inputs and three inputs are nine times and three times more than that for the two inputs, respectively. Therefore, having more inputs could substantially increase the complexity of the models and cause long computational time. In this research, models with two inputs were selected because of their simpler structures and good training accuracy.Using S–C as an example, the inputs were selected asx6andx3, namely ‘screen size’ and ‘side shape’. Though intuitively the attributes ‘layout’ and ‘number buttons style’ are relevant to the S–C dimension, when we look at the morphological analysis of the 32 mobile phones and also their product images, it can be noted that the larger screen size of mobile phones is, the less number of buttons and larger screen layout are. The effect of ‘screen size’ is more dominated compared with the other two attributes in the survey data. Thus, the ‘screen size’ and ‘side shape’ were picked up by the algorithms.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the modeling results based on the proposed approaches are compared with those based on ANFIS, fuzzy least-squares regression (FLSR), fuzzy regression (FR) and genetic programming based fuzzy regression (GP-FR). However, the ANFIS models could not be developed since the training process of ANFIS was a failure and an ‘out of memory’ error occurred, because its structure was too complex. Considering that the PSO-based ANFIS is a stochastic method, 30 runs on the proposed approaches were conducted, and the mean of the 30 runs was calculated. The generated fuzzy rules (Rij)for the S–C, U–G, H–C, and H–B are shown in Appendix A, wherei=1,2,3,j=1,2,3. The optimal value setting of the antecedent parameters is determined through the iteration of PSO. Fig. 3shows the results of the iteration process of PSO for the center of the first membership functionb1for S–C.The same survey data was also used to develop the models based on the proposed approaches, FLSR, FR and GP-FR approaches for the four affective dimensions. Table 6shows the developed models, training errors, and the variance of training errors. From the table, it can be seen that all the developed models can capture the fuzziness of the modeling. However, only the models developed based on the proposed approaches and the GP-FR models can address the nonlinearity of the modeling. The table also shows that the values of ME andVoEbased on the proposed approaches are the smallest compared with those based on the other three approaches.A total of 30 validation tests were conducted to further evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In each validation test, five data sets were randomly selected from the 32 data sets as the testing data sets, and the remaining 27 data sets were used to develop the customer satisfaction models. The validation tests primarily aim to compare the validation errors of the generated customer satisfaction models based on the proposed approaches with those based on FLSR, FR, and GP-FR.FLSR is developed based on the definition of weighted fuzzy arithmetic and the least squares fitting criterion [35]. Different values for h (0⩽h<1)were selected to examine how h affects the results of FLSR [36]. It was found that the changes of h value do not affect the center value of each fuzzy coefficient but influence the value of spread. Also, when a larger value of h is chosen, the prediction capability of the models would increase. Thus, in this study, the h value of FLSR was set as 0.9 for obtaining good prediction capability. After a number of trials using different h values within a range of0,1, the h values of FR were set as 0.9 for S–C and 0.5 for U–G, H–C, and H–B, as these settings led to the smallest modeling errors. For GP-FR, the population size and the number of iteration were set as 40 and 200, respectively. The generation gap, crossover probability, and mutation probability were set as 0.8, 0.7, and 0.3, respectively. The maximum depth of tree was set as 5. The parameter settings of the generated models based on the proposed approaches are shown in Section 3.1. The validation errors and VoE were obtained using (25) and (26), respectively. The 30 validation results for the S–C, U–G, H–C, and H–B models based on the four methods are shown in Figs. 4–7, respectively. The lines with ‘+’, ‘∗’, ‘O’, and the solid line ‘-’ denote the validation results of the FLSR, FR, GP-FR, and the proposed approaches, respectively. Table 7shows the mean validation errors and the mean VoE for the four affective dimensions S–C, U–G, H–C, and H–B based on the four approaches. From the figures and the table, it can be seen that the proposed approaches outperform the other three approaches in modeling customer satisfaction for affective design in terms of prediction errors, mean validation errors and mean VoE for all the affective dimensions.
