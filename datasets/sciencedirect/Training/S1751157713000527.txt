Harmonic coauthor credit: A parsimonious quantification of the byline hierarchy

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Current formulas for calculated coauthor credit were assessed against empirical data.The harmonic formula explained nearly 97% of the variation in the empirical dataset.Fractional credit explained less than 40% of the variation.Equalizing bias explained the discrepancy between fractional and harmonic credit.Adding an extra parameter to the harmonic formula provided no substantial gain in explanatory power.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper the accuracy of five current approaches to quantifying the byline hierarchy of a scientific paper is assessed by measuring the ability of each to explain the variation in a composite empirical dataset. Harmonic credit explained 97% of the variation by including information about the number of coauthors and their position in the byline. In contrast, fractional credit, which ignored the byline hierarchy by allocating equal credit to all coauthors, explained less than 40% of the variation in the empirical dataset. The nearly 60% discrepancy in explanatory power between fractional and harmonic credit was accounted for by equalizing bias associated with the omission of relevant information about differential coauthor contribution. Including an additional parameter to describe a continuum of intermediate formulas between fractional and harmonic provided a negligible or negative gain in predictive accuracy. By comparison, two parametric models from the bibliometric literature both had an explanatory capacity of approximately 80%. In conclusion, the results indicate that the harmonic formula provides a parsimonious solution to the problem of quantifying the byline hierarchy. Harmonic credit allocation also accommodates specific indications of departures from the basic byline hierarchy, such as footnoted information stating that some or all coauthors have contributed equally or indicating the presence of a senior author.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Most scientific papers are multi-authored (Wuchty, Jones, & Uzzi, 2007), by coauthors who have not contributed equally (Waltman, 2012). Nevertheless, it is still routine practice to quantify authorship credit by dividing one credit equally among all coauthors of a paper irrespective of their actual contribution, thereby underestimating the credit of primary authors and overestimating the credit of secondary authors (Hagen, 2008). A more tenable approach is to estimate each coauthor's share of credit as accurately as possible by including all relevant information about the relative size of each contribution when calculating coauthor credit (Hagen, 2010a, 2010b).Accurate quantification of coauthor credit requires a formulaic interpretation of the byline hierarchy which by convention lists coauthors in order of decreasing contribution (Lake, 2010; Zuckerman, 1968). It is also important that the quantification procedure accommodates all specific indications of departures from the basic byline hierarchy, for example footnoted information stating that some or all coauthors have contributed equally (Akhabue & Lautenbach, 2010; Frandsen & Nicolaisen, 2010; Hu, 2009) or indicating the presence of a senior author (Buehring, Buehring, & Gerard, 2007; Mattsson, Sundberg, & Laget, 2011).The harmonic formula, first proposed by Hodge and Greenberg (1981), fits these requirements by providing a straightforward quantification of the byline hierarchy that is easily modified to include specific information about the seniority or equality of some coauthors (Hagen, 2008), while demonstrating a robust fit when validated against empirical data from medicine, psychology, and chemistry (Hagen, 2010b). Recently, Liu and Fang (2012a, 2012b) proposed adding an additional parameter to the harmonic formula, in order to define a continuum of intermediate formulas ranging from fractional equal credit at one extreme to harmonic credit at the other, and suggested that a parameter value corresponding to two thirds of the distance between fractional and harmonic would be the preferred alternative.In this paper I use the harmonic and fractional formulas as reference points when comparing the performance of Liu and Fangs's (2012a, 2012b) model with earlier parametric models from the bibliometric literature proposed by Lukovits and Vinkler (1995), and by Trueba and Guerrero (2004). I assess these formulas by quantifying their ability to explain the variation in a composite set of empirical data on perceived notions of coauthor contribution in chemistry (Vinkler, 2000), medicine (Wren et al., 2007), and psychology (Maciejovsky, Budescu, & Ariely, 2009), adapted for bibliometric analysis by Hagen (2010b). Finally, I conclude by discussing the results with reference to the problem of overfitting and the principle of parsimony.

(1)The harmonic formula explained nearly 97% of the variation in the empirical dataset.Fractional credit explained less than 40% of the variation.Equalizing bias accounted for approximately 60% of the variation.The effect of including an extra parameter to the harmonic formula was a negligible or negative gain in explanatory power.The harmonic formula provides a parsimonious solution to the problem of quantifying the byline hierarchy.To ensure maximum accuracy harmonic credit allocation also accommodates specific indications of departures from the basic byline hierarchy, such as footnoted information stating that some or all coauthors have contributed equally or indicating the presence of a senior author.
