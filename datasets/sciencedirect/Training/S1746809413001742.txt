@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, an electroencephalogram-based innovative brain–computer interface (BCI), known as “Character Plotter”, is presented. The proposed design uses steady-state visually evoked potentials. The subjects generate characters by drawing, step by step, lines between six circles on the computer screen. Additionally, there are three circles for controlling the drawing procedure. The features obtained from canonical correlation analysis are used for classification. The proposed synchronous BCI design was tested on 16 subjects in offline and online experimental tasks using support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis and the nearest mean classifier. The obtained classification performances indicate that the proposed design can be successfully used in classification. The Character Plotter converges to the natural writing scheme of humans. Therefore, subjects can adapt to the BCI design in a short training session.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The electroencephalogram (EEG) has a notably high time resolution, which makes it preferable for real-time applications (e.g., brain–computer interfaces, BCIs). Wolpaw et al. [1] define the BCI as “A BCI is a communication system in which messages or commands that an individual sends to the external world do not pass through the brain's normal output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles”. BCIs have high potential for helping severely disabled people by offering them an increase in functionality and independence [2]. Furthermore, BCIs have the potential to be used in entertainment (e.g., the games sector) [3].EEG-based BCIs use different types of responses embedded in the EEGs. For example, evoked potentials (EPs) are the transient voltage deviations in EEGs that are generated by external (e.g., visual) stimuli [4]. The advantages of using visually EP-based (VEP) BCIs are the easy adaptation of the users and the reduced need for training [5]. VEP-based BCIs can be classified into time modulated VEP (e.g., P300), frequency modulated VEP (e.g., steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)) and pseudorandom code modulated VEP BCIs [6].P300 speller is based on the oddball paradigm, which states that [7]: “Rare expected stimuli produce a positive deflection in the EEG after approximately 300ms.” This P300 response is present in nearly every human [7]. Unfortunately, the difference in the EEG data amplitude can be very small between the P300 and non-P300 responses for single trial cases due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To increase the SNR, the averaging of many trials is needed. However, this task is time consuming.SSVEP is the response of the brain to repetitive visual stimuli [8]. The response is characterized by an increase in the amplitude of the subject's EEG at the flickering frequencies and their harmonics, and it can be observed mainly over the occipital and parietal lobes of the brain [9]. SSVEP responses are less sensitive to the effects of psychological variables (e.g., attention) compared to P300 responses [8]. Moreover, SSVEP-based BCIs do not require the averaging of responses acquired from repeated trials, which is another advantage of SSVEPs over P300 responses. Furthermore, SSVEP-based designs have the analog control capability. In P300-based systems, to generate the target response (P300) that will be used for classification, subjects must wait for the related stimulus. This process is a discrete process. However, in SSVEP-based systems, the responses that are related to the stimulus frequencies continuously exist in the EEG. Therefore, analog control becomes possible. Wilson and Palaniappan [10] presented an online BCI in which the mouse pointer was controlled with the SSVEP responses of the user. They showed that the combination of analog and discrete control generates more robust and faster classification results than the individual discrete or analog classification results.The electrode placement locations, time window length and number of harmonics are the critical parameters in SSVEP-based BCI systems [11]. Selection of the stimulation frequencies is important for the classification performance and is limited because of the limited bandwidth of the EEG [12]. If the stimulation frequencies are selected to be very close to each other, then it becomes more difficult to discriminate between them during classification. However, using frequencies that are outside the best SSVEP response range (5–20Hz) [9] will generate hardly detectable responses in the EEG. It is very desirable to increase the number of classes by using a small number of stimulation frequencies. Mukesh et al. [12] used a suitable combination of frequencies to increase the number of commands, i.e., the number of classes. Yamaguchi et al. [13] proposed an RC (row/column) Speller that combines the row and column responses in a character matrix to make a classification. They used three different frequencies for a nine-class classification task. For a three-second record length, they reached classification accuracies between 70% and 85% on two subjects. In another approach proposed by Zheng et al. [14], each target is composed of two flickers (modulated at specific frequencies) that are placed in the right and left visual fields. Based on this method, a BCI system with nine targets was achieved using only three different frequencies. The reported accuracies on eight subjects vary from 40% (information transfer rate (ITR): 6.8bits/min) to 96.3% (ITR: 48.5bits/min). Hwang et al. [15] proposed an SSVEP-based BCI spelling system using a QWERTY-style LED keyboard. They attached one frequency for each key and mentioned that even a frequency resolution of 0.1Hz is enough for getting high classification results for practical BCI applications. The reported average accuracy on six subjects was 87.58% (ITR: 40.72bits/min).Although most of the SSVEP-based BCI systems use the amplitude at the stimulus frequency, phase and duty cycle information can also be useful. Lopez-Gordo et al. [16] showed that the phase shifts of different stimuli can be recovered from SSVEP responses. They mentioned the joint use of phase and amplitude for increased classification accuracy. Afterward, with the integration of phase information, Jia et al. [17] achieved a design for an SSVEP-based BCI system with 15 targets by using three stimulus frequencies. By using the first three harmonics of the stimulation frequencies, their system generated an average accuracy of approximately 85% for a two-second record length on ten subjects. Cecotti et al. [18] analyzed the effect of the duty cycle and showed that it is possible to discriminate SSVEP responses at the same frequency with different duty cycles.Recently, a hybrid approach which evokes SSVEP and P300 simultaneously was proposed [19]. Proposed design had an accuracy of 93.85% and ITR of 56.44bit/min in a single trial.BCIs can also be classified as synchronous (cue-based) and asynchronous (self-paced) BCIs. Although most of the proposed BCI systems are synchronous, real-world applications require the identification of brain patterns asynchronously without any timing constraints. Asynchronous BCIs continuously analyze the brain activity, and they detect not only the intentional-control states but also the pause periods, where the user is in an idling (non-control) state. Therefore, they are more complicated than the synchronous states [20].Although the signal processing algorithms are notably important for BCI performance, effective stimulation design directly correlates with the classification speed and accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, a novel SSVEP-based BCI named “Character Plotter” is presented. Details concerning the design are provided in the following sections.
