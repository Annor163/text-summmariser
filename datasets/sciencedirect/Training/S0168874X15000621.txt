This paper reports a multiscale asymptotic analysis and computation for predicting heat transfer performance of periodic porous materials with radiation boundary condition. In these porous materials thermal radiation effect at micro-scale have an important impact on the macroscopic temperature field, which is our particular interest in this study. The multiscale asymptotic expansions for computing temperature field of the problem are constructed, and associated explicit convergence rates are obtained on some regularity hypothesis. Finally, the corresponding finite element algorithms based on the multiscale method are brought forward and some numerical results are given in details. The numerical tests indicate that the developed method is feasible and valid for predicting the heat transfer performance of periodic porous materials, and support the approximate convergence results proposed in this paper.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Porous materials are widely applied in the engineering practice due to their various advantages, such as high heat resistance, low thermal conductivity, light weight, etc., which usually have multiple length scales [1–4]. Especially, with rapid development of space aircraft in recent years, porous materials designed as insulation for thermal protection system (TPS) have attracted tremendous attention and wide research interests from scientists and engineers [5–8]. As we know, coupled heat transfer mechanisms in porous materials used for engineering applications contain conduction, convection and radiation. The contribution of convection in total energy transfer was analyzed in Refs. [8–10]. It has been shown that convective heat transfer occurs by flow of fluids, and can be neglected at low pressures or in closed-cell porous materials [8,10]. Radiation is a way of heat transmission and plays a significant role in heat transfer at high temperature [8,10,11]. As a result, the dominant modes of heat transfer are conduction and radiation in porous materials. Generally, in reality, the coupled conduction and radiation problem in porous materials under various complex and extreme environments often makes the analysis and design of materials quite difficult. Also, the materials have periodic configurations and characteristic coefficients oscillate rapidly in small cells. Under such conditions, it is needed to develop new effective numerical and analytical technique for predicting the heat transfer performance of porous materials.Solving the transient heat conduction problem with radiation boundary condition which arises in porous materials will be discussed. In this context, the direct accurate numerical computation of the solution becomes rather difficult because it would require a very fine mesh, and thus a prohibitive amount of computation time to effectively capture the local fluctuation behaviors of temperature field and their derivatives. We know that the homogenization method gives the overall behavior by incorporating the fluctuations due to the heterogeneities, which can not only save the computational resources but also ensure the calculation accuracy. Based on the mathematical homogenization method [12,13], various multiscale approaches for periodic problems have been proposed, refer to Refs. [14–19]. However, they only considered the first-order asymptotic expansions. In some cases, the homogenized solution and first-order solution are not enough to describe the local fluctuation in some physical fields, hence it is necessary to find higher-order multiscale asymptotic expansion for the solution. Recently, the higher-order multiscale asymptotic expansion developed to predict the physical and mechanical properties of composite materials has been discussed by Cui et al. [20–22]. By high-order correctors, the microscopic fluctuation of physical and mechanical behaviors inside the materials can be captured more accurately.Up to now, some homogenization and multiscale methods were introduced for the coupled heat transfer problems in porous materials. Amosov [23,24] investigated the nonstationary radiative–conductive heat transfer problem with rapidly oscillating coefficients, and obtained the error estimates. Liu and Zhang [25] predicted the effective macroscopic properties of heat conduction–radiation problem. Bakhvalov [26] obtained the formal expansions for the solution of those problems. On this basis, Allaire and El Ganaoui [27] discussed the heat conduction model withε−1-order radiation boundary conditions by two-scale asymptotic expansion, and justified the convergence. Meanwhile, Ma and Cui [28] proposed a higher-order asymptotic expansion method to solve the coupled problem, and derived the convergence results with an explicit rateε1/2. It should be noticed that this non-classical model cannot be used for the materials with low porosity, because it over-estimates the radiation behavior on the interior surface of cavities. Cui et al. [29,30] investigated the coupled conduction and radiation problem with small parameterε, and obtained high-order expansions of the solution for the problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, an explicit convergence results and numerical algorithms for the heat conduction with more real radiation boundary conditions of parabolic equations were not found. So, this paper will lay a strong emphasis on the determination of the multiscale error analysis and numerical algorithms for the approximate solutions.In the current work, we will mainly discuss the transient heat conduction problem of periodic porous materials with interior and exterior surface radiation. The interior radiation boundary condition was investigated by Liu and Zhang [25], Bakhvalov [26] and Cui et al. [29,30], and it is a classical model in physics. This paper is to establish a new high-order multiscale method to give a better approximation. We introduce correction terms into the first-order asymptotic expansion of the temperature field, define a family of cell functions, and then obtain the approximate error estimates under some regularity hypothesis. It should be pointed out that the error estimates inH1-norm is stillO(ε1/2)due to its boundary error. Finally, some numerical results are given, which support the theoretical results of this paper and show the advantages and validity of the method developed.The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the formulations of the multiscale asymptotic expansion for the coupled heat transfer problem. In Section 3 the error estimates on the approximate solution is analyzed. Finally, the multiscale algorithms and the numerical results for the heat transfer problem are shown, which support strongly our method.Throughout the paper the Einstein summation convention on repeated indices is adopted.Cdenotes a positive constant independent ofε.In this section, the multiscale asymptotic expansion formulations are constructed for solving the transient coupled heat transfer problem of periodic porous materials with radiation boundary condition.Following Oleinik׳s notation (Ref. [13]), letY={y:0≤yj≤1,j=1,2,3}andωbe an unbounded domain ofR3which satisfies following conditions:(B1)ωis a smooth unbounded domain ofR3with a 1-periodic structure.(B2) The cell of periodicityY⁎=ω∩Yis a domain with a Lipschitz boundary, whereY⁎is a reference periodicity cell, as shown inFig. 1(b).(B3) The setY\ω¯and the intersection ofY\ω¯with theδ0neighborhood of∂Yconsist of finite number of Lipschitz domains separated from each other and from the edges of the cubeYby a positive distance.(B4) The cavities are convex.The domainΩε, as shown in Fig. 1(a), has the form:Ωε=Ω∩εω, whereΩis a bounded Lipschitz convex domain without cavities. Furthermore, suppose that the cavities surfaces are diffuse and gray, i.e., the emissivityeof the surfaces does not depend on the wavelength of the radiation, and assumes that the medium in the cavities is transparent. Hereε>0is a small parameter representing the relative size of a periodic cell of porous materials, i.e.,0<ε=lp/L⪡1, wherelpandLare respectively the sizes of a periodic cell and a whole domainΩεare illustrated in Fig. 1(a) and (b).The heat conduction equation with interior surface radiation with rapidly oscillatory coefficients is firstly studied by Bakhvalov [26], and later by Liu and Zhang [25] and Cui et al. [29,30], in which the radiation boundary condition in a closed cavity is essentially expressed as−vikijε(x)∂Tε(x,t)∂xj=eσTε4(x,t)−e∫Γε,mcRε(z,t)F(x,z)dz,onΓεc,whereTε(x,t)denotes the temperature field,σis the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, andv=(vi),i=1,2,3is the unit outward normal onΓεc.Γεcis the boundary that is composed of interior surfaces of cavityΓε,mc, such thatΓεc=∪m=1m(ε)Γε,mc, andm(ε)the number of cavities contained in porous materials.Rε(x,t)is the intensity of emitted radiation defined byRε(x,t)=eσTε4(x,t)+(1−e)∫Γε,mcRε(z,t)F(x,z)dz,∀x∈Γε,mc.The classical radiation boundary condition is considered in this paper. To simplify the exposition, we assume that the emissivity ise=1. However, our analysis can be extended straightforwardly to the case0<e<1. In addition, the non linear radiation boundary condition that can be interpreted as a radiative heat exchange with an infinite medium characterized by a constant temperatureTeffon the outer surface of the porous materials (see Refs. [31,32]).Under above assumptions, we consider the heat transfer problem with radiation boundary condition for a given structure as follows:(1){∂Tε(x,t)∂t−∂∂xi(kijε(x)∂Tε(x,t)∂xj)=f(x,t),(x,t)∈Ωε×(0,t⁎),Tε(x,t)=T¯,(x,t)∈Γ1×(0,t⁎),Tε(x,0)=Tin(x),x∈Ωε,−vikijε(x)∂Tε(x,t)∂xj=σ(Tε4(x,t)−Teff4),(x,t)∈Γ2×(0,t⁎),−vikijε(x)∂Tε(x,t)∂xj=σ(Tε4(x,t)−∫Γε,mcTε4(z,t)F(x,z)dz),(x,t)∈Γεc×(0,t⁎),wherekijε(x)(i,j=1,2,3)is the coefficients of thermal conductivity tensor;f(x,t)the internal thermal source;TeffandTin(x)denote, respectively, the effective external radiation temperature and the initial temperature field. The boundary can be expressed as∂Ωε=∂Ω∪Γεc=Γ1∪Γ2∪Γεc;Γ1andΓ2denote the boundary portions where temperature and heat flux are prescribed, respectively.T¯is the value of a temperature component onΓ1.F(x,z)is the view factor between two different pointsxandzonΓε,mc, and defined on 3-D for a convex cavity as follows (Refs. [24,26–28]):F(x,z)=nz⋅(x−z)nx⋅(z−x)π|z−x|4,wherenzdenotes the unit normal at the pointz, and for any(x,z)∈(Γε,mc)2(for a closed surface), it satisfies the following properties:F(x,z)≥0,F(x,z)=F(z,x),∫Γε,mcF(x,z)dz=1.We make the following assumptions:(i)kij(xε)=kji(xε).kij(xε)are bounded, and there exist two positive constantsc1andc2such thatc1ηiηi≤kij(xε)ηiηj≤c2ηiηi,whereη=(η1,η2,η3)Tis an arbitrary real column vector inR3.kij(y)is 1-periodic functions iny, andy=x/ε.Teff∈L∞(Ωε),Teff≥0.Define the following spaces (see Refs. [31,32]):W(Ωε)={Tε(x,t)∈H1(Ωε)∩L5(Γ2)∩L5(Γεc)},endowed with norm(2)‖⋅‖W(Ωε)=‖⋅‖H1(Ωε)+‖γ⋅‖L5(Γ2)+‖γ⋅‖L5(Γεc).Besides(3)‖⋅‖W(Ωε)=|.|H1(Ωε)+‖γ⋅‖L5(Γ2)+‖γ⋅‖L5(Γεc).Applying Lemma 3.1 in Ref. [32], (2) is equivalent to (3). For simplicity, letTε=Tε(x,t),T0=T0(x,t)andf=f(x,t)in the following.Remark 2.1By suppositions (i)–(iv), the existence and uniqueness of the weak solutionTε(x,t)for the initial-boundary value problem (1) can be established (see Refs. [31–33]).Enlightened by Refs. [12,13],Tε(x,t)can be expanded into a series in the following form:(4)Tε(x,t)=T0(x,xε,t)+εT1(x,xε,t)+ε2T2(x,xε,t)+⋅⋅⋅,then(5)Tε4(x,t)=(T0(x,xε,t)+εT1(x,xε,t)+ε2T2(x,xε,t)+⋅⋅⋅)4=T04+ε(4T03T1)+ε2(6T02T12+4T03T2)+⋅⋅⋅We sety=xε,xis macroscopic coordinate of the structure, andythe local coordinate of 1-normalized cell.LetAε=ε−2A1+ε−1A2+ε0A3,where(6)A1=−∂∂yi(kij(y)∂∂yj),A2=−∂∂yi(kij(y)∂∂xj)−∂∂xi(kij(y)∂∂yj),A3=−∂∂xi(kij(y)∂∂xj).Taking into account that∂∂xi→∂∂xi+1ε∂∂yi,(i=1,2,3).Substituting (4) into (1), and considering the coefficients ofε−2,ε−1,ε0, one obtains that(7)A1T0=0,(8)A1T1+A2T0=0,(9)A1T2+A2T1+A3T0=f,(10)A1T3+A2T2+A3T1=0,⋅⋅⋅.Furthermore, from the interior radiative boundary term mentioned in (1), we have(11)−vikij(y)(∂∂xi+1ε∂∂yi)=−vi1εkij(y)∂∂yi−vikij(y)∂∂xi.Let(12)Bε=ε−1B0+B1,where(13)B0=−vikij(y)∂∂yi,B1=−vikij(y)∂∂xi.Substituting (5) into (1), and using (12) and (13), which leads to the following identities:(14)BεTε=ε−1B0T0+B1T0+B0T1+ε(B1T1+B0T2)=σTε4(x,t)−σ∫Γε,mcTε4(z,t)F(x,z)dz=σT04(x,y,t)−σ∫ΓcT04(x,s,t)F(y,s)ds+ε(4σT03(x,y,t)T1(x,y,t)−4σ∫ΓcT03(x,s,t)T1(x,s,t)F(y,s)ds)+O(ε2),wheres=z/ε,zdenotes macroscopic coordinate, andsthe local coordinate.Similarly to (14), considering the exterior radiative boundary term of (1) gives(15)BεTε=ε−1B0T0+B1T0+B0T1+ε(B1T1+B0T2)=σ(Tε4(x,t)−Teff4)=σ(T04(x,y,t)−Teff4)+ε4σT03(x,y,t)T1(x,y,t)+O(ε2).Thus, combing (7)–(10), and (14), a series of the mixed boundary value problems are obtained(16){−∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T0(x,y,t)∂yj)=0,inY⁎,−vikij(y)∂T0(x,y,t)∂yj=0,y∈Γc,T0(x,y,t)isY−periodic.(17){−∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T1(x,y,t)∂yj)=∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T0(x,y,t)∂xj)+∂∂xi(kij(y)∂T0(x,y,t)∂yj),inY⁎,−vikij(y)(∂T1(x,y,t)∂yj+∂T0(x,y,t)∂xj)=σ(T04(x,y,t)−∫ΓcT04(x,s,t)F(y,s)ds),y∈Γc,T1(x,y,t)isY−periodic.(18){∂T0(x,y,t)∂t−∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T2(x,y,t)∂yj)=f(x,t)+∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T1(x,y,t)∂xj)+kij(y)∂2T0(x,y,t)∂xi∂xj+kij(y)∂∂xi∂T1(x,y,t)∂yj,inY⁎,−vi(kij(y)∂T2(x,y,t)∂yj+kij(y)∂T1(x,y,t)∂xj)=4σ(T03(x,y,t)T1(x,y,t)−∫ΓcT03(x,s,t)T1(x,s,t)F(y,s)ds),y∈Γc,T2(x,y,t)isY−periodic,whereΓcis the boundary of the cavities contained inY⁎.Y⁎is the solid part ofY.From (16) it follows thatT0(x,y,t)is independent ofy.Then, (17) can be rewritten as(19){−∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T1(x,y,t)∂yj)=∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T0(x,t)∂xj),inY⁎,−vikij(y)(∂T1(x,y,t)∂yj+∂T0(x,t)∂xj)=σ(T04(x,t)−∫ΓcT04(x,t)F(y,s)ds),y∈Γc,T1(x,y,t)isY−periodic.By virtue of∫Γε,mcF(x,z)dz=1, it is easy to verify that(20)σT04(x,t)−σ∫ΓcT04(x,t)F(y,s)ds=0.Thanks to (20), (19) can be written as(21){−∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T1(x,y,t)∂yj)=∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T0(x,t)∂xj),inY⁎,−vikij(y)(∂T1(x,y,t)∂yj+∂T0(x,t)∂xj)=0,y∈Γc,T1(x,y,t)isY−periodic.Suppose that the solution of (21) has the following form:(22)T1(x,y,t)=Nα1(y)∂T0∂xα1+T˜1(x,t),T˜1(x,t)is only dependent ofx,T1(x,y,t)isy-periodicity. Then, we obtain the auxiliary functionNα1(y)(α1=1,2,3)defined on 1-normalized cellY⁎.Nα1(y)is the solution of the following elliptic partial differential equation:(23){∂∂yi(kij(y)∂Nα1(y)∂yj)=−∂kiα1(y,t)∂yi,inY⁎,−vi(kij(y)∂Nα1(y)∂yj+kiα1(y))=0,y∈Γc,Nα1(y)isY−periodic.Similarly to Lemma 2.2 in Ref. [30], it is proved that problems (23) have a unique solution.By analogy, considering (18) and using (22), one obtains that(24){∂T0(x,t)∂t−∂∂yi(kij(y)∂T2(x,y,t)∂yj)=∂∂yi(kij(y)Nα1(y))∂2T0∂xj∂xα1+kij(y)∂2T0∂xi∂xj+kij(y)∂Nα1(y)∂yj∂2T0∂xi∂xα1+f(x,t),inY⁎,−vi(kij(y)∂T2(x,y,t)∂yj+kij(y)Nα1(y)∂2T0∂xj∂xα1)=4σT03∂T0∂xα1(Nα1(y)−∫ΓcNα1(s)F(y,s)ds),y∈Γc,T2(x,y,t)isY−periodic.We impose the homogenization operator to both sides of equality (24), and obtain the homogenized equation associated with (1) as follows:(25)|Y⁎|∂T0∂t−∫Y⁎kij(y)∂Nα1(y)∂yjdy∂2T0∂xi∂xα1−∫Y⁎kij(y)dy∂2T0∂xi∂xj+4σT03∂T0∂xα1∫Γc(Nα1(y)−∫ΓcNα1(s)F(y,s)ds)dy=|Y⁎|f(x,t).It follows from∫ΓcF(s,y)dy=1that the fourth term in (25) is equal to(26)4σT03∂T0∂xα1∫Γc(Nα1(y)−∫ΓcNα1(s)F(y,s)ds)dy=0.Therefore, combing (15), (25) and (26), one can obtain the homogenized equation associated with (1) given by(27){|Y⁎||Y|∂T0(x,t)∂t−∂∂xi(k^ij∂T0(x,t)∂xj)=|Y⁎||Y|f(x,t),(x,t)∈Ω×(0,t⁎),T0(x,t)=T¯(x,t),(x,t)∈Γ1×(0,t⁎),T0(x,0)=Tin(x),x∈Ω,−vik^ij∂T0(x,t)∂xj=σ(T04(x,t)−Teff4),(x,t)∈Γ2×(0,t⁎),where(28)k^ij=1|Y|∫Y⁎(kip(y)∂Nj(y)∂yp+kij(y))dy,|Y|denotes the Lebesgue measure ofY. According to supposition (ii) and Oleinik [13] it follows thatk^ijis symmetrical and positive definite.Remark 2.2Similarly to the proof proposed in Refs. [31,33], the homogenized problem (27) has a unique positive solutionT0(x,t)onL2((0,t⁎),W(Ω)).Further,f(x,t)can be substituted by (27), to satisfy (25), we seek a reasonable expression forT2(x,y,t)T2(x,y,t)=Nα1α2(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1(y)T03∂T0∂xα1,whereT0(x,t)is the homogenization solution onΩ.Nα1α2(y)andCα1(y)(α1,α2=1,2,3)are the local functions defined onY⁎. One can define them as follows:Nα1α2(y)is the solution of the following problem:(29){∂∂yi(kij(y)∂Nα1α2(y)∂yj)=k˜α1α2−∂∂yi(kiα2(y)Nα1(y))−kα1α2(y)−kα2j(y)∂Nα1(y)∂yj,inY⁎−vi(kij(y)∂Nα1α2(y)∂yj+kiα2(y)Nα1(y))=0,y∈Γc,Nα1α2(y)isY−periodic.Cα1(y)is the solution of the following problem:(30){∂∂yi(kij(y)∂Cα1(y)∂yj)=0,inY⁎,−vi(kij(y)∂Cα1(y)∂yj)=4σ(Nα1(y)−∫ΓcNα1(s)F(y,s)ds),y∈Γc,Cα1(y)isY−periodic,wherek˜α1α2=|Y||Y⁎|k^α1α2.Remark 2.3Following the idea of Refs. [29,30], under assumptions (B1)–(B3) and (i)–(iii), existence and uniqueness of (29) and (30) can be easily established.Now we can define the multiscale approximate solution of problem (1)(31)T1ε(x,t)=T0+εNα1(y)∂T0∂xα1,T2ε(x,t)=T0+εNα1(y)∂T0∂xα1+ε2(Nα1α2(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1(y)T03∂T0∂xα1),whereT1ε(x,t)andT2ε(x,t)are called the first-order and the second-order multiscale approximate solutions, respectively.To compareT1ε(x,t)with the original solution, we substituteTε(x,t)−T1ε(x,t)into (1), and have(32)Lε(Tε(x,t)−T1ε(x,t))=f(x,t)−∂∂t(T0+εNα1(y)∂T0∂xα1)+kij(y)∂Nα1(y)∂yj∂2T0∂xi∂xα1+∂∂yi(kij(y)Nα1(y))∂2T0∂xj∂xα1+kij(y)∂2T0∂xi∂xj+εkij(y)∂2∂xi∂xj(Nα1(y)∂T0∂xα1),whereLε=(∂/∂t)−(∂/∂xi)(kijε(x)(∂/∂xj)). It is not difficult to see that the residual is the orderO(1). But in the practical engineering computation,εis a fixed smaller constant rather than tending to zero. The errorO(1)is not accepted for the engineers who want to capture the local behavior inside materials. So the first order solution is not adopted in engineering computation.SubstitutingTε(x,t)−T2ε(x,t)into (1) we obtain that(33)Lε(Tε(x,t)−T2ε(x,t))=∂Tε(x,t)∂t−∂∂xi(kijε(x)∂Tε(x,t)∂xj)−∂∂t(T0+εNα1(y)∂T0∂xα1+ε2(Nα1α2(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1(y)T03∂T0∂xα1))+∂∂xi(kijε(x)∂∂xj(T0+εNα1(y)∂T0∂xα1+ε2(Nα1α2(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1(y)T03∂T0∂xα1)))=εF0+ε2∂∂xiFi,where(34)F0=kij(y)Nα1(y)∂3T0∂xi∂xj∂xα1+kij(y)∂Nα1α2(y)∂yj∂3T0∂xi∂xα1∂xα2+∂∂yi(kij(y)Nα1α2(y))∂3T0∂xj∂xα1∂xα2+kij(y)∂Cα1(y)∂yj∂∂xi(T03∂T0∂xα1)+∂∂yi(kij(y)Cα1(y))∂∂xj(T03∂T0∂xα1)+εkij(y)Nα1α2(y)∂4T0∂xi∂xj∂xα1∂xα2−∂∂t(Nα1(y)∂T0∂xα1+ε(Nα1α2(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1(y)T03∂T0∂xα1))Fi=kij(y)Cα1(y)∂∂xj(T03∂T0∂xα1).Note that the residual of (33) is the orderO(ε). The second order solution is equivalent to the solution of original problem inO(ε)-order pointwise sense. It is the reason that we consider the second order expansions in this paper.To sum up, one obtains the following theorem.Theorem 2.1Temperature field for the heat transfer problem(1)of periodic porous materials with radiation boundary condition has a multiscale asymptotic expansion as follows:Further, the temperature gradient can be evaluated by(36)∂T2ε(x,t)∂xi=∂T0∂xi+∂Nα1(y)∂yi∂T0∂xα1+εNα1(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xi+ε∂Nα1α2(y)∂yi∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+ε2Nα1α2(y)∂3T0∂xα1∂xα2∂xi+ε∂Cα1(y)∂yiT03∂T0∂xα1+ε2Cα1(y)(T03∂2T0∂xα1∂xi+3T02∂T0∂xi∂T0∂xα1).In this section, we give the error estimates for the multiscale approximate solution.Theorem 3.1Suppose thatΩε⊂R3is a bounded Lipschitz domain and∂Ω∈C4. LetTε(x,t)be the solution of(1),T0(x,t)is the solution of homogenized equation of(27).T2ε(x,t)is the approximate solution stated in(31). Under assumptions (B1)–(B4) and (i)–(iv), iff∈H2,1(Ω×[0,t⁎)),Tin(x)∈H4(Ω), we obtain the following error estimates:Cis positive constant independent ofε.ProofFrom (33) and (34), we obtain the residual insideΩε.For(x,t)∈Γ1×(0,t⁎), this leads to(37)Tε(x,t)−T2ε(x,t)=−εNα1(y)∂T0∂xα1−ε2Nα1α2(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2−ε2Cα1(y)T03∂T0∂xα1=φε(x,t).Following the lines of the proof of Theorem 1.2 of (Ref. [13], Chapter II), for any fixedt∈(0,t⁎), we obtain(38)‖φε(x,t)‖H1/2(Γ1)≤Cε1/2‖T0‖H3(Ω).whereCis a constant independent ofε.Also for the initial conditions, it follows that(39)Tε(x,0)−T2ε(x,0)=Tin(x)−Tin(x)−εNα1(y)∂T0∂xα1|t=0−ε2(Nα1α2(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1(y)T03∂T0∂xα1=εφ0(x,y),‖φ0(x,y)‖L2(Ωε)≤C.On the boundaryΓε,mc, lety=x/ε,s=z/ε, and for the sufficiently smooth homogenized solutionsT0(x,t), we have(40)−vikijε(x)(∂Tε(x,t)∂xj−∂T2ε(x,t)∂xj)=σ(T0+εNα1(y)∂T0∂xα1+ε2Nα1α2(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+ε2Cα1(y)T03∂T0∂xα1+ε3P1(ε,x,y,t))4−σ∫Γc(T0+εNα1(s)∂T0∂xα1+ε2Nα1α2(s)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+ε2Cα1(s)T03∂T0∂xα1+ε3P1(ε,x,s,t))4F(y,s)ds+vikij(y)(∂T0∂xj+∂Nα1(y)∂yj∂T0∂xα1+εNα1(y)∂2T0∂xj∂xα1+ε∂Nα1α2(y)∂yj∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+ε2Nα1α2(y)∂3T0∂xj∂xα1∂xα2+ε∂Cα1(y)∂yjT03∂T0∂xα1+ε2Cα1(y)∂∂xj(T03∂T0∂xα1)).By virtue of the boundary condition onΓcforNα1(y),Nα1α2(y),Cα1(y)and the regularity ofT0(x,t)it follows that:(41)−vikijε(x)(∂Tε(x,t)∂xj−∂T2ε(x,t)∂xj)=ε2F,where(42)F=vikij(y)(Nα1α2(y)∂3T0∂xj∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1(y)∂∂xj(T03∂T0∂xα1))+4T03σ(Nα1α2(y)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1(y)T03∂T0∂xα1)−∫Γc4T03σ(Nα1α2(s)∂2T0∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1(s)T03∂T0∂xα1)F(y,s)ds+6T02σ(Nα1(y)∂T0∂xα1)2−∫Γc6T02σ(Nα1(s)∂T0∂xα1)2F(y,s)ds+O(ε).Similarly to (41), on the boundaryΓ2, we have(43)−vikijε(x)(∂Tε(x,t)∂xj−∂T2ε(x,t)∂xj)=σ(Tε(x,t)4−Teff4)−(ε−1B0T0+B1T0+B0T1+ε(B1T1+B0T2))=σ(Tε(x,t)4−Teff4)−σ((T04−Teff4)+ε4T03T1+ε2(6T02T12+4T03T2))=O(ε3).Thus, combing (37), (39), (41) and (43), we conclude thatTε(x,t)−T2ε(x,t)is a weak solution of the following initial-boundary value problem(44){Lε(Tε(x,t)−T2ε(x,t))=εF0+ε2∂∂xiFi,(x,t)∈Ωε×(0,t⁎),Tε(x,t)−T2ε(x,t)=φε(x,t),(x,t)∈Γ1×(0,t⁎),−vikijε(x)∂(Tε(x,t)−T2ε(x,t))∂xj=O(ε3),(x,t)∈Γ2×(0,t⁎),Tε(x,0)−T2ε(x,0)=εφ0(x,y),x∈Ωε,−vikijε(x)∂(Tε(x,t)−T2ε(x,t))∂xj=ε2F,(x,t)∈Γεc×(0,t⁎).Noting, after integration and summation over all cells, we obtain a remainder term given by(45)∑m=1m(ε)|Γε,mc|O(ε2)=O(ε−d)O(εd−1)O(ε2)=O(ε),whered=2 or 3 in applications. Then, from the regularity ofNα1(y),Nα1α2(y),Cα1(y)andT0(x,t), according to (38), (39), (41), and (43)–(45), in a standard way, using Gronwall׳s inequality, we complete the proof of Theorem 3.1.Because of the residual (44) onΓ1, we can only get the approximate order ofO(ε).In this section, we describe the algorithm procedure to study the asymptotic behavior of the heat transfer problem (1), and perform some numerical examples.1)FE solutions of cell functions and homogenized coefficientsThe FE solutions of cell functionsNα1h(y)can be obtained by solving the following FE virtual work equation on unit cellY⁎:(46)∫Y⁎kij(y)∂Nα1h(y)∂yj∂v∂yidy=∫Y⁎−kiα1(y)∂v∂yidy,∀v∈Sh(Y⁎).Then, the FE approximationk^ijof homogenized coefficients can be evaluated as follows:(47)k^ijh=1|Y|∫Y⁎(kip(y)∂Njh(y)∂yp+kij(y))dy,whereSh(Y⁎)⊆H01(Y⁎)denotes the FE space of 1-squareY⁎,Y⁎is partitioned into FE setShof finite elements,his the mesh size. Similarly to (46) and (47),Nα1α2h(y)andCα1h(y)can be obtained by solving(48)∫Y⁎kij(y)∂Nα1α2h(y)∂yj∂v∂yidy=∫Y⁎(kα1α2(y)−k˜α1α2h+kα2j(y)∂Nα1h(y)∂yj)vdy−∫Y⁎kiα2(y)Nα1h(y)∂v∂yidy,∀v∈Sh(Y⁎),(49)∫Y⁎kij(y)∂Cα1h(y)∂yj∂v∂yidy=−∫Γc4σ(Nα1h(y)−∫ΓcNα1h(s)F(y,s)ds)vdy,∀v∈Sh(Y⁎).FE solution of homogenized problemThe FE solution of homogenized problem (27) is the solution of following FE virtual work equations associated with homogenized coefficient (28) onΩ(50)∫Ω|Y⁎||Y|∂T0h0(x,t)∂tvdx+∫Ωk^ijh(∂T0h0(x,t)∂xi)∂v∂xjdx+∫Γ2σ((T0h0(x,t))4−Teff4)vdx=∫Ω|Y⁎||Y|f(x,t)vdx,∀v∈Sh0(Ω),whereSh0(Y⁎)denotes the FE space with mesh sizeh0on the homogenized domainΩ. The backward Euler full discrete format proposed in Ref. [34] is used for the discretization. Then, the homogenization equation with nonlinear radiation is calculated by a fixed point algorithm onΩfor each time step (see Refs. [27,28]).Multiscale approximation solutionAccording to (31) and (46)–(50), the multiscale approximation solution based on global structureΩεcan be evaluated by(51)T1,h,h0ε(x,t)=T0h0+εNα1h(y)∂T0h0∂xα1,T2,h,h0ε(x,t)=T0h0+εNα1h(y)∂T0h0∂xα1+ε2(Nα1α2h(y)∂2T0h0∂xα1∂xα2+Cα1h(y)(T0h0)3∂T0h0∂xα1).The algorithm procedure of the multiscale method for predicting the thermal properties of the heat transfer problem with radiation boundary condition is stated as follows:1)Form and verify the distribution of cavities in reference cell, and the geometry of the structure. Further, partitionY⁎into finite element meshes set.Obtain the FE solutions ofNα1(y)(α1=1,2,3)according to the problem (23) with given material properties based on the FE model of the unit cell. Furthermore, the homogenization coefficientk^ij(i,j=1,2,3)is evaluated by the formula (28).Compute the homogenized solutionT0(x,t)obtained by solving problem (50) on global structureΩ, and the standard Backward Euler full discrete format is employed to solve the transient nonlinear homogenized problem.EvaluateNα1α2(y)andCα1(y)(α1,α2=1,2,3)by solving the auxiliary problems (29) and (30) using finite element method (FEM) based on unit cellY⁎, respectively.Compute the high-order partial derivatives∂2T0/∂xα1∂xα2(α1,α2=1,2,3)by the average technique on relative elements (see Ref. [35]).Compute the temperature and the temperature gradient using formulas (31) and (36).Consider the mixed boundary value problem (1), whereΩεis composed of entire cells shown inFig. 2(a), and the reference cellY⁎is shown in Fig. 2(b). The boundary temperatures in the z-direction are set asT¯1=0K,T¯2=0K and the time step isΔt=0.02.σ=5.669996×10−8W/m2K4, and the radius of the cavity inY⁎is 0.25, respectively. The initial temperatureTin(x)is set to 0.0K, and setTeff=0.0K.Since it is difficult to find the analytical solution of the above problem, we have to takeTε(x,t)to be its FE solutionT_FEin the very fine mesh. The linear tetrahedral elements are employed for the semi-discrete coupled problem of (1) using fine meshes and that of the corresponding homogenized equation using a coarse mesh. The numbers of tetrahedrons and nodes are shown inTable 1. Here we take the approximate solution in (51) and backward Euler full discrete format in to account.The following three cases are investigated:Case1:Kij=10δijW/mK,f(x,t)=105J/m3s,Case2:Kij=100δijW/mK,f(x,t)=105J/m3s,Case3:Kij=100δijW/mK,f(x,t)=106J/m3s,whereδij(i,j=1,2,3) is the Kronecker delta, and ifi=j,δij=1, orδij=0. It should be noted thatT0h0(x,t)denotes the numerical solution of the homogenized equation (27),T1,h,h0ε(x,t)andT2,h,h0ε(x,t)the first-order and the second-order multiscale numerical solutions based on (31). Seterror0=T_FE−T0h0(x,t),error1=T_FE−T1,h,h0ε(x,t)anderror2=T_FE−T2,h,h0ε(x,t). For convenience, we introduce the following notation:‖v‖L2=(∫Ωε|v|2dx)1/2,|v|H1=(∫Ωε(|∇v|2)dx)1/2.The relative numerical errors of the homogenization, first-order multiscale and second-order multiscale methods inL2-norm andH1-norm for examples are listed inTables 2 and 3.Fig. 3(a)–(d) illustrate the numerical results forT0h0(x,t),T1,h,h0ε(x,t),T2,h,h0ε(x,t)andT_FEat the intersectionx3=0.15 in Case 1 and at timet=0.2.Fig. 4(a)–(d) illustrate the numerical results forT0h0(x,t),T1,h,h0ε(x,t),T2,h,h0ε(x,t)andT_FEat the intersectionx3=0.15 in Case 3 and at timet=0.2.Fig. 5(a) and (b) display the numerical results for temperature gradient∂Tε(x,t)/∂x1,∂Tε(x,t)/∂x2along the line ofx1=x2,x3=0.15 in Case 3 and at timet=0.2.Figs. 6 and 7 clearly show the evolution of the relative errors of approximate solutions with timetin the Cases 1 and 3, where error0L2, error1L2, error2L2, error0H1, error1H1, and error2H1 denote‖error0‖L2/‖T_FE‖L2,‖error1‖L2/‖T_FE‖L2,‖error2‖L2/‖T_FE‖L2,|error0|H1/|T_FE|H1,|error1|H1/|T_FE|H1,|error2|H1/|T_FE|H1, respectively.From the numerical results reported in Figs. 3–5 and Tables 2–3, we found that the homogenization solution and the first-order solution are insufficient to describe local fluctuation of the solution for considering coupled problems. We need to seek the second-order solution. The computational results displayed clearly verify that the second-order multiscale method give more accurate numerical solutions.As a result of our numerical analysis, we claim that, though the second-order multiscale method does not improve the approximate estimation (Refs. [29,30]), for a fixed value ofεit improves the qualitative behavior of the reconstructed solution. The relative errors between different approximate solutions and FE solutions obtained on refined mesh are also exhibited in Figs. 6 and 7. It is worth to note that the relative errors are not growing significantly as time increases. This shows that the multiscale method is a very good method for treating a long-time problem in some cases. All the results obtained above demonstrate that the second-order multiscale method proposed in this paper is effective in approximating the coupled problems of porous materials with radiation boundary condition.To check the influence of the radiation effect on the temperature field, we display a numerical example for different boundary temperature.A macrostructureΩε, which is the union of entire periodic cells as displayed in Fig. 2(a), is chosen. The internal heat sourcef(x,t)is set to 10,000J/m3s,kij=δijW/mK(i,j=1,2,3).Fig. 8(a) and (b) illustrate the numerical results of the temperature fieldT2,h,h0ε(x,t)for different boundary temperature i.e. there is no radiation effect, and along the line ofx1=0.15,x3=0.15 and at timet=0.2.As shown in Fig. 8, the second-order multiscale approximation is enough to capture the microscopic behavior of the solution, and the second order expansion developed in this paper such that more detail information of radiation effect on the surfaces of the cavities can be acquired. Hence, it is concluded that the proposed model is sufficiently accurate for computation of the coupled problem with interior and exterior radiation.From Table 1, it is seen that the mesh partition numbers of the newly multiscale approximate solution are much less than that of refined FE solution, and computation time is also much less than that of the refined FE solution, especially for smallε. It means that the multiscale method proposed in this paper can greatly save computer memory and CPU time without losing precision, which is of great importance in engineering computations. Actually, Both the multiscale method and the direct numerical simulations are performed on the same computer (which has memory of 512GB and 16 processors with CPU=2.67GHz). On the aspect of the multiscale method, it is very cheap to solve the simulation (it takes about 1s to finish solving the cell problem, and homogenized problem about 10s for one iteration), which takes the majority of the computational efforts. On the other hand, the direct numerical simulation takes about 680s to finish simulating the heat transfer problem with radiation boundary condition in the examples because it requires fine meshes, also the convergence of FE method based on fine meshes for the nonlinear coupled problem is not easy.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, the multiscale asymptotic analysis and numerical algorithms are developed for predicting the heat transfer performance of periodic porous materials with boundary radiation condition. The multiscale asymptotic expansion formulations for the heat transfer problem are given, and the error estimates withε1/2order is derived under the regularity assumption of the homogenized solution and the correction terms.Finally, in the numerical examples, it is noted that higher order schemes are proposed. By evaluatingNα1α2(y)andCα1(y)(α1,α2=1,2,3), we can acquire more detail information of radiation effect on the surfaces of the cavities, which support the theoretical results of this paper and demonstrate that the multiscale analysis method is effective.
