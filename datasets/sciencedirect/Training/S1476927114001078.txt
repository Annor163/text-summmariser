@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Protein nitration is an important post-translational modification regulating protein structure and function, especially for heme proteins. Myoglobin (Mb) is an ideal protein model for investigating the structure and function relationship of heme proteins. With limited structural information available for nitrated heme proteins from experiments, we herein performed a molecular dynamics study of human Mb with successive nitration of Tyr103, Tyr146, Trp7 and Trp14. We made a detailed comparison of protein motions, intramolecular contacts and internal cavities of nitrated Mbs with that of native Mb. It showed that although nitration of both Tyr103 and Tyr146 slightly alters the local conformation of heme active site, further nitration of both Trp7 and Trp14 shifts helix A apart from the rest of protein, which results in altered internal cavities and forms a water channel, representing an initial stage of Mb unfolding. The computational study provides an insight into the nitration of heme proteins at an atomic level, which is valuable for understanding the structure and function relationship of heme proteins in non-native states by nitration.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Protein nitration is one of post-translational modifications (PTMs), which is derived from the reaction of Tyr/Trp residues in proteins, including heme proteins such as myoglobin (Mb) (Bourassa et al., 2001; Witting et al., 2001; Herold et al., 2003; Herold and Shicashankar, 2003; Herold, 2004; Nicolis et al., 2006; Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013), hemoglobin (Hb) (Xiang et al., 2013), cytochrome c (cyt c) (Batthyány et al., 2005; Rodríguez-Roldán et al., 2008; García-Heredia et al., 2010), and others (Smith et al., 1992; CrySavvides et al., 2002; Quint et al., 2006; Yamakura et al., 2003; Suzuki et al., 2004), with reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Compared to protein modifications by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2−), less attention has been attracted to RNS (Yamakura and Ikeda, 2006). Meanwhile, RNS such as peroxynitrite can be formed by coupling of superoxide with nitric oxide radial (NO), an important signaling molecule in vivo (Darleyusmar et al., 1992). Peroxynitrite can also be generated in cells when exposure to radiation from X-rays as presented in our daily lives, such as computed tomography (CT) scans in hospital (Brenner and Hall, 2007). Increased levels of nitrated tyrosine were observed in the mouse hippocampus within two hours of radiation exposure (8Gy) compared to controls (Fukuda et al., 2004).Moreover, protein nitration was found to occur in presence of nitrite (NO2−) and H2O2, especially for heme proteins (Bourassa et al., 2001; Witting et al., 2001; Herold et al., 2003; Herold and Shicashankar, 2003; Herold, 2004; Nicolis et al., 2006; Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013; Xiang et al., 2013; Batthyány et al., 2005; Rodríguez-Roldán et al., 2008; García-Heredia et al., 2010). This is of biological relevance since bacteria on human tongue surface may reduce dietary nitrate (2–3mM daily) to nitrite (Lundberg et al., 2004), and H2O2 is a common ROS generated in vivo. Heme proteins play diverse functions in biological systems including oxygen delivery, electron transfer, catalysis and signaling, and their structure and function relationships are well-studied (Lu et al., 2003, 2009; Mayfield et al., 2011; Coelho et al., 2013; Spiro et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013, 2014; Lin and Wang, 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Poulos, 2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no 3D structural information available for nitrated heme proteins, although nitration of Mb has been observed as early as in 2001 (Bourassa et al., 2001). Crystal structures for other nitrated proteins are also limited (Smith et al., 1992; CrySavvides et al., 2002; Quint et al., 2006). This is likely due to the difficulty in purification of nitrated proteins from unmodified ones with slight structural differences. The structure and function relationship of nitrated heme proteins remains poorly understood. Recently, Iniesta and co-workers (Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013) selectively nitrated horse Mb at Tyr103 using an electrochemical approach and performed spectroscopic studies on not pure nitrated Mb, which provides some undirected structural information for nitrated Mb.As a compliment, computational approach such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become a powerful tool to provide atomic level and time-dependent information for protein structure and function that otherwise is difficult to obtain from experiments (Karplus and McCammon, 2002; Daggett, 2006; Sotomayor and Schulten, 2007; Kandt and Monticelli, 2010; Lin, 2011; Lin and Liao, 2011; Lin et al., 2012a). Mb is an ideal protein model for investigating the structure and function relationship of heme proteins in both native and non-native states (Lu et al., 2003, 2009; Lin et al., 2013, 2014; Lin and Wang, 2013; Liu et al., 2014), and computer simulation plays a key role in guiding protein design and engineering based on Mb (Sigman et al., 2000; Yeung et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2012b). To provide structural insights into nitrated heme proteins, we herein performed MD simulation studies on human Mb with successive nitration of Tyr residues (Tyr103 and Tyr146) and Trp residues (Trp7 and Trp14), at 3- and 6-postions, i.e., 3-nitrotyrosine and 6-nitrotryptophan, respectively (Fig. 1), which are the major nitrated products based on experimental observations (Bourassa et al., 2001; Witting et al., 2001; Herold et al., 2003; Herold and Shicashankar, 2003; Herold, 2004; Nicolis et al., 2006; Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013; Xiang et al., 2013; Batthyány et al., 2005; Rodríguez-Roldán et al., 2008; García-Heredia et al., 2010).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
With limited structural information available for nitrated heme proteins, we performed a MD simulation study and investigated the structural consequences of successive nitration of human Mb at Tyr103/Tyr146 close to the heme active site and Trp7/Trp14 remote from the heme active site. It showed that nitration of Tyr103/Tyr146 slightly alters local conformation and leaves the heme active site largely intact, in agreement with experimental observations (Nicolis et al., 2006; Gómez-Mingot et al., 2013). Meanwhile, nitration of Trp7/Trp14 shifts helix A apart from the rest of protein, resulting in forming a water channel, which represents an initial stage of Mb unfolding. The simulation study also revealed that nitration regulates the distribution and formation of internal cavities that are closely linked to ligand binding and migration inside Mb. This study thus provides valuable information of nitration at an atomic level for heme proteins, and also for understanding their structure and function relationship in non-native states by nitration.
