@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In myoelectric prostheses design, it is normally assumed that the necessary control information can be extracted from the surface myoelectric signals. In the pattern classification paradigm for controlling myoelectric prosthesis, the autoregressive (AR) model coefficients are generally considered an efficient and robust feature set. However, no formal statistical methodologies or tests are reported in the literature to analyze and model the myoelectric signal as an AR process. We analyzed the myoelectric signal as a stochastic time-series and found that the signal is heteroscedastic, i.e., the AR modeling residuals exhibit a time-varying variance. Heteroscedasticity is a major concern in statistical modeling because it can invalidate statistical tests of significance which may assume that the modeling errors are uncorrelated and that the error variances do not vary with the effects being modeled. We subsequently proposed to model the myoelectric signal as an autoregressive-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (AR-GARCH) process and used the model parameters as a feature set for signal classification. Multiple statistical tests including the Ljung–Box Q-test, Engle's test for heteroscedasticity, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the goodness of fit test were performed to show the validity of the proposed model. Our experimental results show that the proposed AR-GARCH model coefficients, when used as a feature set in two different classification schemes, significantly outperformed (p<.01) the conventional AR model coefficients.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The pattern classification for myoelectric control is based on the assumption that the muscle activations are distinguishable and repeatable. The direct classification of the myoelectric signal is not preferred due to its large dimensionality and stochastic nature [1]. Therefore, the myoelectric signal is first segmented to form analysis windows. A set of representative features is extracted from each analysis window and is subsequently fed to a classifier [2,3]. Depending on the type of the classification algorithm, the classifier may require supervised or semi-unsupervised training [4,5]. Once trained, the output of the classification algorithm is a single identified movement class based on the input myoelectric signal. Various classification algorithms are employed for the purpose of myoelectric signal classification, e.g., the linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), different flavors of artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), neuro (fuzzy) schemes, Gaussian mixture models (GMM), and hidden Markov models (HMM) [2,3,5] (and references therein). Advanced classifiers including the support vector machines (SVM) [6], twin SVM [7] and self-enhancing LDA and QDA [8] have also been recently proposed. Furthermore, blind source separation (BSS) techniques including the independent component analysis (ICA) are also used to classify myoelectric signals [9,10]. Generally the pattern classification systems have produced promising results with classification accuracies in the range of 90% or more [2,3].In the myoelectric control, the choice of an appropriate feature set is crucial for the pattern classification. Parker et al. have shown that the classification accuracy in a pattern classification scheme is more affected by the choice of the feature set than by the classification algorithm [11]. A common and promising feature set considered in the myoelectric control literature consists of autoregressive (AR) coefficients [2,5,8]. Tkach et al. investigated different features under conditions of change in muscle effort level, muscle fatigue and electrode shift, and found the AR coefficients to be one of the most robust features [12]. Similarly, Young et al. found that, under conditions of socket misalignment, the AR features performed better than the time-domain features [13]. However, in the myoelectric control literature, there has not been an exclusive effort to model the myoelectric signal as an AR process using formal statistical tools. A generally adopted procedure in the literature is to adjust (increase or decrease) the AR model order based on the required classification accuracy and available computational resources. Such practice usually results in an AR model order in the range of 4–6 [2,5]. We believe that a detailed statistical study is essential to, (1) identify the parsimonious AR model order for the myoelectric signal, (2) measure the goodness of fit of the identified model, and (3) evaluate various characteristics of the modeling residuals, such as the sample autocorrelation and/or the heteroscedasticity. In the present work, we show that modeling the myoelectric signal as an AR process results into the residual errors that exhibit heteroscedasticity, i.e., “variability” in the variance. [14]. Concept of heteroscedasticity, autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and generalized ARCH (GARCH) models are introduced in Appendix A.In biomedical engineering applications, the GARCH models have been employed to extract features from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals within the framework of wavelet transforms [15]. The GARCH models have also been used within a state-space framework and the Kalman filter for modeling non-stationary variance in the EEG signal [16], or modeling covariance for generation of the EEG signal [17]. In the case of myoelectric signals, the GARCH process has been used for noise suppression with wavelet coefficients [18]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no exclusive effort is reported in the literature to model the myoelectric signal as an AR-GARCH process and use its parameters as a basis for statistical inference and biophysical interpretation. In Fig 1, we contrast the proposed approach with the conventional AR feature approach. The proposed AR-GARCH model extracts more information from the myoelectric signal as compared to the conventional scheme as the AR residuals further modeled as a GARCH process.
