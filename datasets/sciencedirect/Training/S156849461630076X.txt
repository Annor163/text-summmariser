@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Technology credit scoring models have been used to screen loan applicant firms based on their technology. Typically a logistic regression model is employed to relate the probability of a loan default of the firms with several evaluation attributes associated with technology. However, these attributes are evaluated in linguistic expressions represented by fuzzy number. Besides, the possibility of loan default can be described in verbal terms as well. To handle these fuzzy input and output data, we proposed a fuzzy credit scoring model that can be applied to predict the default possibility of loan for a firm that is approved based on its technology. The method of fuzzy logistic regression as an appropriate prediction approach for credit scoring with fuzzy input and output was presented in this study. The performance of the model is improved compared to that of typical logistic regression. This study is expected to contribute to practical utilization of the technology credit scoring with linguistic evaluation attributes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many technology-based small and medium enterprises (SMEs) suffer from liquidity problems [1], which can be directly related to bankruptcy [2]. In order to resolve such a problem, a bank loan can be utilized. But it requires collateral, which cannot be provided by the majority of technology-based start-ups. These firms can use a technology credit guarantee program, which allows loans based on their characteristics of technology, profitability, the marketability of the technology, and the top manager's capability [3–10].In typical evaluation process, relative weights for these attributes are pre-set for scoring. However, while many attribute can be evaluated in an objective manner, some of them require qualitative verbal expressions for evaluation. For instance, the market potential is expressed in terms of “bad”, “good”, or “very good”. This kind of verbal expression has been converted into a Likert scale and has been treated as an ordered categorical variable or interval variable in many technology credit scoring models [9–11].Although the terms were converted into Likert scale or ordered variable, there is still the issue of how linguistic terms can be properly dealt with. So, this study employs the fuzzy logic to handle the nature of linguistic terms [12]. Fuzzy numbers can reflect the inherent uncertainty in evaluation problems [13]. In our study, those linguistic evaluation terms are converted into triangular fuzzy numbers, whereas typical models consider them to be crisp numbers. Also, we describe the possibility of loan defaults using triangular fuzzy numbers. While the typical technology credit scoring model focuses on whether or not the company will default [10], the possibility of loan default can be monitored before the event via relationship lending. It can be considered to be fuzzy as well.Many previous studies have applied fuzzy approaches to credit scoring [14,15,59]. They used various modern methods, such as neuro-fuzzy model, fuzzy support vector machine and fuzzy k-nearest neighbor algorithm. However, they are not good enough to explain the relationship between the characteristics of loan applicant and the default. The fuzzy logistic regression facilitates such interpretation of the scoring results based on the coefficient associated with each variable. However, there have not been any attempts to apply the fuzzy logistic regression to credit scoring.This study proposes a new technology credit scoring model based on the fuzzy logistic regression utilizing both the fuzzy evaluation data obtained at the application stage and the data regarding the fuzzy possibility of loan default obtained during the monitoring stage of relationship lending. Predicting the possibility of loan default during monitoring is crucial, because it can prevent actual default by providing help or can establish deliberate strategies to collect a debt early on. We propose a new method of fuzzy logistic regression with fuzzy input and output data for predicting the possibility of loan default of firms. This is the first attempt in fuzzy logistic regression method that allows for handling of both fuzzy input and output. The estimation method of coefficients is conducted based on Yoon and Choi [16].The following section reviews the previous works related to technology evaluation models and fuzzy logistic regression. Section 3 introduces the data and shows the process of fitting the new model by employing the fuzzy least squares estimation. Section 4 describes the significant results of this study.
