Graphical abstractHere proposes a protein map method based on 12 major physicochemical properties and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method. The map without degeneracy and loss of information has good visualization. This graph shows HA genes of 6 influenza A (H1N1) isolates by the proposed method. There are two main clusters. From the graph, it is easy to identity that from the global view the 6 HA genes are different.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A graphical representation of a biological sequence is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing sequences. Many graphical methods have been designed to analyze DNA or a protein sequence. A DNA sequence is composed of four nucleic bases A, C, G and T. Comparing with the 20 amino acids in a protein sequence, four different symbols of the DNA sequence are beneficial to its graphical representation because of less symbol number. Early graphical methods of the DNA sequence include Hamori in 1983 [1], Hamori in 1989 [2] and Jeffrey in 1990 [3]. Afterwards, more graphical representations were well developed by researchers. For example, Nandy in 1994 [4] gave a graphical representation by assigning A, G, T and C to the four directions, (−x), (+x), (−y) and (+y), respectively. Bielinska-Waz [5–7], Liao [8–10], Randić [11–13], Jaklic [14], Li [15] and Qi [16–18] also proposed their graphical representations of the DNA sequence. These proposed graphical methods can provide direct insights into the local and global characteristics of DNA sequences.Compared to the graphical representation of DNA sequences, the graphical representation of protein sequences is difficult because of the twenty amino acids. However, the advantages of graphical representation of protein sequences attract many researchers to develop different representation methods. The early graphical methods of protein sequences were presented in 2004 by Randić et al. [19,20]. They constructed the graphical representations of protein sequences based on the 64 codons. After that, researchers developed graphical representations of protein sequences in two main directions. One is not related to the physicochemical properties of amino acids. For instance, in 2006 Randić et al. [21] outlined a novel highly compact graphical representation for proteins based on a ‘magic circle’ of unit radius. In 2005 Bai and Wang [22] also proposed a 2D graphical representation of protein sequences based on nucleotide triplet codons. Recently, He et al. [23] presented a 3D graphical representation of protein sequences built on the Gray code. These methods don’t take the physicochemical properties of amino acids into account.The other type of graphical representation for protein sequences is closely related to the physicochemical properties of amino acids. The physicochemical properties of amino acids are essential when separating, purifying and studying protein sequence profiles, folding, classifying and functions. The physicochemical properties have strong effects on the pattern of protein evolution. This is also an important reason for connecting physicochemical properties with graphical representations for protein sequences. However, it is difficult to take more physicochemical properties into consideration when graphically representing a protein sequence in 2D or 3D space. In 2007, Randić [24] first presented a 2D graphical representation of proteins built on the partial order of a selected pair of physicochemical properties of amino acids. This is a good contribution. Later, more researchers proposed their graphical representations with two or three types of physicochemical properties [25,26,27] in 2D or 3D space. In [28], Randić gave more comments for the graphical representations considering physicochemical properties. These graphical representations share a common feature that a protein sequence has a corresponding graphical space curve. They contribute to comparing the similarities and dissimilarities of protein sequences. Then, Yao et al. [29] proposed a 2D graphical representation of protein sequences based on six physicochemical properties of amino acids. Yu et al. [30] presented a new protein map which incorporated ten properties of amino acids. These methods which consider more than three physicochemical properties are difficult to visualize. A protein sequence is likely mapped into a set of graphical curves.The graphical representation of a protein sequence is confronted with two difficulties, good visualization and more major physicochemical properties. In this article, we propose a protein mapping method based on 12 major physicochemical properties and the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method. The mapping without degeneracy and loss of information provides good visualization. With the graphical representation, the method is used to analyze the evolutionary relationship of two separate datasets. The results agree well with the known evolution fact and show the efficiency of our method. In addition, how to classify which proteins bind to nanoparticles in a sequence dependent manner is a major issue in medical applications in nanotechnology [31,32]. In [31], Monopoli et al. review the basic concept of the nanoparticle corona, and highlight how the properties of the corona may be linked to its biological impacts. If a nanoparticle corona has given evidence of its preference for a protein sequence, here the proposed mapping method can be used to find more candidate proteins. This is a possible application in medical applications in nanotechnology.
