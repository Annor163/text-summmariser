@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The interpretation of physiological signals is an important subject in affective computing. In this paper, we report an experiment to collect affective galvanic skin response signals (GRS), and describe a new imbalanced fuzzy support vector machine (IBFSVM) for their classification. IBFSVM introduces denoising factors and class compensation factors, thus defining a new fuzzy membership. The effectiveness of IBFSVM is verified on various real and artificial datasets. We define an appropriate evaluation criterion (g_mean) that combines the classification accuracy of positive and negative samples, and show that IBFSVM outperforms traditional support vector machines on imbalanced datasets. By running the IBFSVM for the datasets in our experiment, we can find that the g_mean of happiness, sadness, angry and fear is 85.17%, 86.6%, 87.4%, and 81.53% respectively. So IBFSVM is an effective and feasible solution for imbalanced learning in our experiment.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Affective detection represents the foundation of harmonious human–machine interaction, and is thus one of the key problems in affective computing. Human emotional states are inherently linked to psychological and physiological changes, which are manifested by behavioral, facial, and physical signals. By analyzing these observable signals, a human's affective state can be inferred. Compared with facial expressions, speech, and body posture, physiological signals better reflect the activity pattern of the autonomic nervous system. Hence, affective detection based on physiological signals has been studied by many researchers [1–3]. Support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used for pattern recognition, and have been employed for affective detection based on physiological signals [4,5].Although SVMs perform well with balanced datasets, their capability is greatly reduced when the dataset is imbalanced [6,7]. SVM classifiers can produce models that are biased toward the majority class and perform poorly with the minority class. In the real world, imbalanced datasets are common, so improving the performance of imbalanced learning is a very important for SVMs.SVMs are very sensitive to noise and outliers, which affect the slope of the decision hyperplane, and thus the performance of the SVM. Lin and Wang [8] proposed a fuzzy SVM (FSVM) to overcome the influence of outliers, but FSVM cannot deal with imbalanced samples; the accuracy in the minority class is still poor. Based on the above analysis, we propose an imbalanced FSVM (IBFSVM) that not only deals with outliers, but can also handle imbalanced datasets. In this paper, IBFSVM is applied to imbalanced learning in affective detection based on galvanic skin response (GSR) signals.The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, we discuss some related work on imbalanced learning with SVMs, and Section 3 describes the IBFSVM algorithm in detail, and compares the results from applying IBFSVM to artificial datasets and UCI datasets. Section 4 introduces the experimental process for affective detection and presents the classification results of IBFSVM for affective GSR datasets. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the results and conclusions from this study.
