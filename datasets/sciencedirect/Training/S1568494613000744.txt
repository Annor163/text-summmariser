@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the paper, two adaptive fuzzy control schemes including indirect and direct frameworks are developed for suppressing the wing-rock motion that is a highly nonlinear aerodynamic phenomenon in which limit cycle roll oscillations are experienced by aircraft at high angles of attack. In the two control topologies, a dynamic fuzzy system called Extended Sequential Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ESAFIS) is constructed to represent the dynamics of the wing-rock system. ESAFIS is an online learning fuzzy system in which the rules are added or deleted based on the input data. In the indirect control scheme, the ESAFIS is used to estimate the nonlinear dynamic function and then a stable indirect fuzzy controller is designed based on the estimator. In the direct control scheme, the ESAFIS controller is directly designed to imitate an ideal stable control law without determining the model of the dynamic function. Different from the original ESAFIS, the adaptive tuning algorithms for the consequent parameters are established in the sense of Lyapunov theorem to ensure the stability of the overall control system. A sliding mode controller is also designed to compensate for the modelling errors of ESAFIS by augmenting the indirect/direct fuzzy controller. Finally, comparisons with a neuron control scheme using the RBF network and a fuzzy control scheme with Takagi–Sugeno (TS) system are presented to depict the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy controllers achieve better tracking performance with dynamically allocating the rules online.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Wing rock is a highly nonlinear aerodynamic phenomenon in which limit cycle roll oscillations are experienced by aircraft at high angles of attack [1]. The wing-rock motion is a concern because it may cause a loss of stability in the lateral/directional mode due to the large amplitudes and high frequencies of the rolling oscillations, thus degrading the maneuverability, tracking accuracy and operational safety of the high-performance fighters. To understand the underlying mechanism of the wing-rock motion, some research has been conducted on the motion of slender delta wings and several theoretical models that describe the nonlinear rolling motion are developed using simple differential equations [2,3]. During the past decades, many control techniques have been developed [4–7]. Based on the differential models, the control strategies used to suppress the wing-rock motion include nonlinear optimal feedback control [5], the adaptive control based on the feedback linearization [6] and the robust H∞ control [7]. Although these methods are successful in controlling the wing-rock motion, a key assumption in these methods is that the system nonlinearities are known a priori, which is generally not applicable in the real world. The reason is that the aerodynamic parameters governing wing rock are inadequately understood and thus an accurate mathematical model for the wing-rock motion can not be obtained. These present significant difficulties to the controller design using conventional control techniques.A fuzzy inference system provides an effective means of capturing the approximate, inexact nonlinear mappings using a series of if–then fuzzy rules and thus has been widely applied in the control of nonlinear systems [8–11]. Since in the wing-rock motion situation the model information is inexact and the operating conditions are uncertain, the rule based fuzzy controllers have been developed to suppress its oscillations in [12] and [1] where three term sets and seven term sets have been employed for the fuzzification of the control variables, respectively. Numerical results have been presented to demonstrate the robustness of the fuzzy controllers. However, these methods create the fuzzy inference rules for fuzzy controllers according to the designer experience and have no on-line learning ability. If the fuzzy rules are not appropriate and deviate from the requirement of the system itself, this may result in poor performance. Besides, although the rules are correct, it is hard to determine the appropriate parameters for the fuzzy rules. Inappropriate parameters also may result in poor performance. Neural networks possess an inherent structure suitable for learning and reconstructing complex nonlinear mappings and thus some control techniques based on neural networks have been proposed for the control of wing-rock motion [13–15]. With the learning capabilities of neural networks, the effects of nonlinearities and system uncertainties are compensated, thereby improving the stability, convergence and robustness of the control system.Combining the advantages of the neural network (learning) and the fuzzy inference system (approximation reasoning) one can develop fuzzy-neural system which exhibits both the above characteristics. Some adaptive fuzzy control schemes based on fuzzy neural systems have been developed for suppressing the wing-rock motion. In [16], a supervisory fuzzy controller is designed using a recurrent fuzzy neural network which is inherently a recurrent multilayered neural network for realizing fuzzy inference with dynamic fuzzy rules. In the method, the parameters of fuzzy systems are adjusted based on the gradient descent method and the Lyapunov stability theorem to increase the learning capability. The existing methods, regardless of the neural-network based controllers or fuzzy based controllers demonstrate good performance in the control of wing-rock motion, but the network structure or system structure, that is the number of hidden neurons or the number of fuzzy rules need to be predefined by trail-and-error before learning. This may cause redundant or inefficient computation, thereby decreasing the flexibility and numerical processing capability of the controller.An approach to tackle this problem is the use of adaptive learning algorithms for constructing a fuzzy control system systematically and automatically. In the paper, novel adaptive fuzzy control schemes in the indirect and direct frameworks are designed based on the Extended Sequential Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System (ESAFIS) [17] for the control of wing-rock motion. ESAFIS is developed based on the SAFIS algorithm [18] for improving the learning accuracy and computational speed. Similar to SAFIS, the ESAFIS algorithm consists of two aspects: determination of the fuzzy rules and adjustment of consequent parameters in fuzzy rules. ESAFIS uses the concept of modified influence of a fuzzy rule to add and remove rules during learning. ESAFIS starts with no fuzzy rules and based on the data builds up a compact rule base. The modified influence of a fuzzy rule is defined as its contribution to the system output in a statistical sense, which avoids the uniform distribution of the input data required in SAFIS. The ESAFIS algorithm offers a fast online learning algorithm due to the dynamical recruitment or deletion of fuzzy control rules without predefinition. Its outstanding computational efficiency in terms of learning speed, adaptability and generalization has been verified in our latest work [17].In the proposed adaptive fuzzy control schemes, the fuzzy controllers are built employing ESAFIS to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of wing-rock motion. However, different from the original ESAFIS algorithm where a Recursive Least-Square Error (RLSE) is used to adjust the consequent parameters, they are updated based on the stable adaptive laws derived from a Lyapunov function that is an effective way to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system and has been widely applied to solve many practical control problems [19–21]. And also a sliding controller is incorporated into the fuzzy controller and activated to work with the fuzzy controller for offsetting the modelling errors of the ESAFIS.This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the dynamic model of the wing-rock motion under consideration. Section 3 gives a brief review of the ESAFIS algorithm. In Section 4, the design procedure of the adaptive fuzzy controllers is introduced. Section 5 shows the simulation results by controlling the wing-rock system. Section 6 presents the conclusions from this study.The nonlinear wing-rock motion for an 80° slender delta wing developed by Nayfeh et al. [3] is considered in the study, whose dynamics is described by the following differential equation:(1)ϕ¨=ρU∞2Sb2IxxCl−Dϕ˙+uwhere ϕ is the roll angle, ρ is the density of air, U∞ is the freestream velocity, S is the wing reference area, b is the chord, Ixxis the mass moment of inertia, D is the damping coefficient and fixed as 0.0001, u is the control input, and Clis the roll moment coefficient that is given by,(2)Cl=a1ϕ+a2ϕ˙+a3ϕ3+a4ϕ2ϕ˙+a5ϕϕ˙2The aerodynamic parameters a1–a5 are nonlinear functions of the angle of attack α and presented in Table 1.Substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), the wing-rock dynamics then is rewritten as,(3)ϕ¨+ω2ϕ=μ1ϕ˙+b1ϕ˙3+μ2ϕ2ϕ˙+b2ϕϕ˙2+uThe coefficients in the above equation are given by the following relations:(4)ω2=−Ca1,μ1=Ca2−D,μ2=Ca4,b1=Ca3,b2=Ca5whereC(=ρU∞2Sb/2Ixx)is a fixed constant and equal to 0.354.The values of the coefficients in Eq. (3) could be obtained for any angle of attack according to any interpolation method. [3] has pointed out that the observed onset angle where μ1 is zero corresponding to the onset of wing rock is “19–20°”. This can be verified by observing the properties of the open-loop system with u=0. The simulations are done under two specific angles of attack, viz, α=15° that is smaller than the observed onset angle and α=25° that is larger than the observed onset angle. Fig. 1(a) and (b) present the time process of the calculated roll angle and the roll rate given by Eq. (3) for α=15°. From the two figures, one can observe that the roll oscillations are stable and the wing-rock motion does not occur. But the oscillation time is very long, which increases the maneuverability burden. The time process of the roll angle and its roll rate for α=25° are given in Fig. 2(a) and (b). In this case, the wing-rock motion occurs and appears limit cycle roll oscillations. Thus the control objective here is to suppress the wing rock whatever the angle of attack is, i.e., maintain the roll angle and the roll rate at the zero conditions in a fast speed.By choosing state variables x1=ϕ andx2=ϕ˙, the state equations of the wing-rock dynamics will be(5)x˙1=x2x˙2=f(x1,x2)+uwheref(x1,x2)=−ω2ϕ+μ1ϕ˙+b1ϕ˙3+μ2ϕ2ϕ˙+b2ϕϕ˙2is assumed to be bounded real continuous nonlinear function.Defining x=[x1, x2], Eq. (5) can be further written in the following state-space form,(6)x˙=Ax+bf(x)+buwhere(7)A=0100,b=01Define the output tracking error e=ϕd−ϕ, the reference output vectorϕd=[ϕd,ϕ˙d]T, the tracking error vectore=[e,e˙]T=[e1,e2]T. The control law u is designed such that the stateϕ=[ϕ,ϕ˙]Tcan track the desired commandϕd=[ϕd,ϕ˙d]Tas closely as possible.According to feedback linearization method [22] and dynamics system given by Eq. (6), the desired control input u* can be obtained as follows:(8)u*=ϕ¨d−f(x)+k1e˙+k2ewhere k1 and k2 are the real number. By substituting Eq. (8) into Eq. (6), the following equation is obtained(9)e¨+k1e˙+k2e=0By properly choosing k1 and k2, all roots of the polynomial s2+k1s+k2=0 are in the open left half plane, which implies that the tracking error will converge to zero. Eq. (9) also shows that the tracking of reference command is asymptotically achieved from any initial conditions, i.e.,limt→∞|e|=0.However, if the motion dynamics f(x) is perturbed or unknown, it is difficult to implement this control law in practical applications. To circumvent this problem, two adaptive fuzzy control strategies based on the ESAFIS are designed. Before presenting the fuzzy control schemes, a brief description of ESAFIS is given in the following section.ESAFIS is the extension version of SAFIS algorithm for improving its accuracy and speed. Different from SAFIS, ESAFIS can implement both the zero-order and first-order TS fuzzy models, which are commonly described as follows:Rulek:if(x1isA1k)⋯(xNxisANxk),then(yˆ1isak1)⋯(yˆNyisakNy)where Aik(i=1, …, Nx) denotes the fuzzy sets, namely, linguistic values associated with the ith input variable xiin rule k, Nxis the dimension of the input vectorx(x=[x1,…,xNx]), Nhis the number of fuzzy rules, Nyis the dimension of the output vectoryˆ(yˆ=[yˆ1,…,yˆNy]). In ESAFIS, the number of fuzzy rules Nhvaries. Initially, there is no fuzzy rule and then during learning fuzzy rules are added and removed. For the zero-order TS fuzzy model, the consequence akj(k=1, 2, …, Nh;j=1, 2, …, Ny) is a constant while in the first-order TS fuzzy model, a linear combination of input variables, that isakj=qk0,j+qk1,jx1+⋯+qkNx,jxNxis used as the consequence. A lot of research work have proved that first-order TS fuzzy model possesses better performance in terms of system structure and learning ability than zero-order TS fuzzy model [23,17]. Thus ESAFIS with first-order TS fuzzy model is mainly studied here to construct the control law.The structure of ESAFIS illustrated by Fig. 3consists of five layers to realize the above fuzzy rule model.Layer 1: In layer 1, each node represents an input variable and directly transmits the input signal to layer 2.Layer 2: In this layer each node represents the membership value of each input variable. ESAFIS utilizes the function equivalence between a RBF network and a FIS. Thus its antecedent part (if part) in fuzzy rules is achieved by Gaussian functions of the RBF network as used in many existing literature [24–26]. The membership value of the fuzzy set Aik(xi) for the ith input variable xiin the kth Gaussian function is given by(10)Aik(xi)=exp−(xi−μik)2σk2,k=1,2,…,Nhwhere Nhis the number of the Gaussian functions, μikis the center of the kth Gaussian function for the ith input variable, σkis the width of the kth Gaussian function. In ESAFIS, the width of all the input variables in the kth Gaussian function is the same.Layer 3: Each node in the layer represents the if part of if–then rules obtained by the sum–product composition and the total number of such rules is Nh. The firing strength (if part) of the kth rule is given by(11)Rk(x)=∏i=1NxAik(xi)=exp−∑i=1Nx(xi−μik)2σk2=exp−||x−μk||2σk2Layer 4: The nodes in the layer are named as normalized nodes whose number is equal to the number of the nodes in third layer. The kth normalized node is given by:(12)R¯k=Rk(x)∑k=1NhRk(x)Layer 5: Each node in this layer corresponds to an output variable, which is given by the weighted sum of the output of each normalized rule. The system output is calculated as(13)yˆ=∑k=1NhakRk(x)∑k=1NhRk(x)and the consequence is(14)ak=xeTqkwhere xeis the extended input vector by appending the input vector x with 1, that is [1, x]T; qkis the parameter matrix for the kth fuzzy rule and given by(15)qk=qk0,1⋯qk0,Ny⋮⋯⋮qkNx,1⋯qkNx,Ny(Nx+1)×NyThe system output denoted by Eq. (13) can be rewritten as(16)yˆ=HQwhere Q is the consequent parameter matrix existing in all Nhfuzzy rules and H is the vector representing normalized firing strength of rules. The two parameters are given by(17)Q=q10,1⋯q10,Ny⋮⋮⋮q1Nx,1⋯q1Nx,Ny⋮⋯⋮qNh0,1⋯qNh0,Ny⋮⋯⋮qNhNx,1⋯qNhNx,NyNh(Nx+1)×Nyand(18)H=xeTR1(x)∑k=1NhRk(x),…,xeTRNh(x)∑k=1NhRk(x)1×Nh(Nx+1)The learning algorithm of ESAFIS involves addition and removal of fuzzy rules online and adjustment of the consequent parameters. To avoid the difficulty of knowing the input distribution as a priori knowledge in SAFIS, ESAFIS uses the concept of modified influence of a fuzzy rule to add and remove rules during learning. The modified influence represents a statistical contribution of the rule to the output using a certain limited number of samples. Suppose that the input observations are generated in a random distribution and arrive with the same sampling distribution, the modified influence Eminf(k) can be estimated by recently received M training samples as long as memory factor M is reasonably large. It is given by(19)Eminf(k)=∑l=n−M+1n||xleTqk||MRk(xl)∑k=1NhRk(xl)The sequential learning process of ESAFIS is briefly summarized below. For details, see [17].ESAFIS begins with no fuzzy rules. As inputs xn,yn(n is the time index) are received sequentially during learning, fuzzy rules are added or deleted based on the following two criteria, viz., distance criterion and the modified influence of the newly added fuzzy rule Nh+1,(20)||xn−μnr||>ϵnEminf(Nh+1)=∑l=n−M+1n||en||MRNh+1(xl)∑k=1Nh+1Rk(xl)>egwhere ϵn, egare thresholds to be selected appropriately, xnis the latest input data,μnris the center of the fuzzy rule nearest to xn. egis the growing threshold and chosen according to the desired learning accuracy. κ is an overlap factor that determines the overlap of fuzzy rules in the input space.en=yn−yˆn, where ynis the true value andyˆnis the approximated value. ϵnis the distance threshold which decays exponentially and given as(21)ϵn=max{ϵmax×γn,ϵmin}where ϵmax, ϵmin are the largest and smallest length of interest and γ is the decay constant. The equation shows that initially it is the largest length of interest in the input space which allows fewer fuzzy rules to coarsely learn the system and then it decreases exponentially to the smallest length of interest in the input space which allows more fuzzy rules to finely learn the system.When a new fuzzy rule Nh+1 is added, its corresponding antecedent and consequent parameters are assigned as follows:(22)q(Nh+1)0,j=enj,j=1,2,…,Nyq(Nh+1)i,j=0,i=1,2,…,NxμNh+1=xnσNh+1=κ||xn−μnr||where enjis the jth element of the system output error vectoren(=yn−yˆn).When there is no addition of a new rule, the consequent parameters of all existing rules (Q) are modified based on a RLSE method. However, when this method is applied for controller design, problems such as the stability of the overall scheme and convergence of the approximation error arise. Thus using Lyapunov stability theory, stable parameter tuning laws instead of RLSE method are derived for ESAFIS here that guarantee the stability of the overall system. This will be introduced in the following sections.After parameter adjustment the existing rules will change their influence on the system output and thus all rules need be checked for possible pruning. If the modified influence of a rule is less than a certain pruning threshold ep, the rule is insignificant to the output and should be removed. Given the pruning threshold epselected properly, the kth fuzzy rule will be removed by satisfying Eminf(k)<ep. When the kth rule need to be removed from the existing fuzzy rules, the number of fuzzy rules will be reduced to Nh−1 and all the parameters including centerμk, width σkand consequence qkrelated with this rule will be reduced from the related matrices to suit the reduced system.The dynamical learning capability of ESAFIS can be used as the basis for learning in adaptive control. Generally adaptive control approaches can be classified into two categories, namely, indirect adaptive control and direct adaptive control schemes. In the indirect control strategy, ESAFIS is used to identify the nonlinear motion dynamics f(x) and then the fuzzy control law is implemented using the identified model. In the direct adaptive control, ESAFIS is directly used to approximate the control law u* without explicitly attempting to determine the model of the dynamics f(x). To fully depict the potential of ESAFIS in the design of adaptive controller, in the following section we focus on showing how to achieve stable indirect/direct adaptive control for the wing-rock problem when ESAFIS is used as an online approximator.The proposed indirect adaptive fuzzy control scheme is illustrated in Fig. 4, where two controllers are incorporated, viz, a fuzzy controller ufand a sliding controller us. The fuzzy control term ufis constructed using the ESAFIS for learning the system dynamics f(x) and given as(23)uf=ϕ¨d−fˆ(x)+k1e˙+k2ewherefˆ(x)is the approximated value from ESAFIS and represented as(24)fˆ(x)=HQIAccording to the universal approximation theorem of fuzzy systems [27], there exists an optimal fuzzy system estimator to approximate the nonlinear dynamic function f(x) in Eq. (6) such that(25)f(x)=HQI*+ϵIwhere ϵIis the approximation error,QI*are the optimal parameters and defined as follows:(26)QI*=Δargminsupx∈Mx||f(x)−fˆ(x)||where ||·|| represents the two-norm of a vector, Mxis the predefined compact set of input vector x.Using the approximation theory, the inherent approximation error ϵIcan be reduced arbitrarily with the number of fuzzy rules increasing. In ESAFIS, the fuzzy system starts with no fuzzy rules. Fuzzy rules are dynamically recruited according to their significance to the system performance and the complexity of the mapped system. Thus it is reasonable to assume that ϵIis bounded by the constantɛ¯I, i.e.,|ϵI|≤ɛ¯I.To compensate for the approximation error in representing the actual nonlinear dynamics by the ESAFIS with ideal parameter values, a sliding mode controller usis used to augment the fuzzy controller above and thus the overall control law is considered as,(27)u=uf+usOn the basis of Eqs. (23)–(25) and (27), the tracking error of Eq. (6) becomes as,(28)e˙=Λe+b[HQ˜I−ϵI−us]whereQ˜I(=QI−QI*)is the parameter error with dimension 3Nh×1 and H is the normalized firing strength with dimension 1×3Nh. Λ represents the 2×2 controllable canonical form matrix equaling to(29)Λ=0100+00−k2−k1=01−k2−k1During the modelling process of ESAFIS, the determination of fuzzy rules and antecedent parameters are based on its learning algorithm described above. Different from RLSE method, the parameter QIhere is updated using the following stable adaptive laws for satisfying the stability of the entire system.Theorem 4.1Consider the wing-rock dynamics represented by Eq.(5). If the indirect fuzzy control law is designed as Eq.(23), the parameter update law and the sliding mode control law are designed as Eq.(30), the stability of the proposed indirect fuzzy control system can be assured(30)Q˙IT=−ηIeTPbHus=ɛ¯Isgn(eTPb)where(31)sgn(eTPb)=1eTPb>0−1eTPb<0Consider the following Lyapunov function candidate,(32)V=12eTPe+12ηIQ˜ITQ˜Iwhere P is the symmetric and positive definite matrix, ηIis a positive constant that appears in the adaptation law and is referred to as the learning rate.Using Eq. (28), the derivative of the Lyapunov function is given as,(33)V˙=12[e˙TPe+eTPe˙]+1ηIQ˜˙ITQ˜I=12eT(ΛTP+PΛ)e+eTPbH+1ηIQ˜˙ITQ˜I−eTPbϵI−eTPbus=−12eTJe+eTPbH+1ηIQ˜˙ITQ˜I−eTPbϵI−eTPbuswhere J=−(ΛTP+PΛ). J is a symmetric definite matrix and selected by the user.Based on Eq. (30), Eq. (33) becomes,(34)V˙=−12eTJe−eTPbϵI−eTPbɛ¯Isgn(eTPb)Eq. (34) further satisfies the following condition:(35)V˙≤−12eTJe+|eTPb||ϵI|−eTPbɛ¯Isgn(eTPb)Since |eTPb|=(eTPb)sgn(eTPb), Eq. (35) becomes(36)V˙≤−12eTJe+|eTPb|(|ϵI|−ɛ¯I)Notice that(37)|eTPb|(|ϵI|−ɛ¯I)≤0So(38)V˙≤−12eTJe≤0The above equation illustrates thatV˙is negative semidefinite and thus the overall control scheme is guaranteed to be stable. Using Barbalat's lemma [28,29], it can be seen that as t→∞, e→0. Thus the tracking error of the system will converge to zero. □Remark 1: The fuzzy control term within the indirect adaptive control law defined by Eqn. (23) is used to learn the unknown dynamics f(x) of the system in order to provide asymptotic convergence of the tracking error. The sliding-mode control term usis then used to compensate for the approximation error between the nonlinear function of the system and the ESAFIS with optimal parametersHQI*. It is noteworthy that although usis called a sliding-mode control term, it is different from the traditional one. The reason is that it does not guarantee that the state trajectory will slide along the manifold eTPb=0 as traditionally guaranteed with nonadaptive sliding-mode control [30,31].The configuration of the proposed direct adaptive fuzzy control scheme is illustrated in Fig. 5, where the fuzzy controller ufis connected in parallel with the sliding mode controller usto generate an overall control signal u. Thus the overall control law u is the summation of the two control signals,(39)u=uf+usThe fuzzy controller is built based on the ESAFIS to directly estimate the perfect control law u* represented in Eq. (8), which is given as(40)uf=HQDAccording to the universal approximation theorem of fuzzy systems [27], there exists the optimal parametersQD*to approximate the perfect control law, which is defined as(41)QD*=Δargminsupz∈Mzu*−ufsuch that(42)u*=HQD*+ϵDwhere ||·|| represents the two-norm of a vector, Mzis the predefined compact set of input vector z. It is noted that the inputs of fuzzy controllers in the direct adaptive control scheme are the desired commandϕ¨d, the state vector x, and the error vector e. ϵDis the approximation error and assumed to be bounded by the constantɛ¯Dwith the increase of the fuzzy rules, i.e.,|ϵD|≤ɛ¯D.A sliding mode control term usis once again required to compensate for the approximation error in modeling fuzzy controller ufby the ESAFIS. Adding and substructing bu* to Eq. (6) and applying Eq. (39), the system tracking error can be shown to be(43)e˙=Λe+bu*−uf−usAccording to Eqs. (40) and (42), the system error of Eq. (43) can further be expressed as(44)e˙=Λe+b[HQ˜D+ϵD−us]whereQ˜D(=QD*−QD) is the parameter error.During modelling the input signal, the ESAFIS learning algorithm is used to determine the appropriate structure and antecedent parameters of the fuzzy system. The parameter QDis tuned based on the following stable laws.Theorem 4.2Consider the wing-rock dynamics represented by Eq.(5). If the direct fuzzy control law is designed as Eq.(40), the parameter update law and the sliding mode control law are designed as Eq.(45), the stability of the proposed direct fuzzy control system can be assured(45)Q˙DT=ηDeTPbHus=ɛ¯Dsgn(eTPb)where(46)sgn(eTPb)=1eTPb>0−1eTPb<0Consider the following Lyapunov function candidate:(47)V=12eTPe+12ηDQ˜DTQ˜Dwhere P is the symmetric and positive definite matrix, ηDis a positive constant that represents the learning rate.Using Eq. (44), the derivative of the Lyapunov function is given as(48)V˙=12[e˙TPe+eTPe˙]+1ηDQ˜˙DTQ˜D=12eT(ΛTP+PΛ)e+(eTPbH+1ηDQ˜˙DT)QD+eTPbϵD−eTPbus=−12eTJe+eTPbH+1ηDQ˜˙DTQD+eTPbϵD−eTPbuswhere J=−(ΛTP+PΛ). J is a symmetric definite matrix and selected by the user.Under Eq.(45), Eq. (48) becomes(49)V˙=−12eTJe+eTPbϵD−eTPbɛ¯Dsgn(eTPb)Eq. (49) further satisfies the following condition,(50)V˙≤−12eTJe+|eTPb||ϵD|−eTPbɛ¯Dsgn(eTPb)Since |eTPb|=(eTPb)sgn(eTPb), Eq. (50) yields(51)V˙≤−12eTJe+|eTPb|(|ϵD|−ɛ¯D)Notice that(52)|eTPb|(|ϵD|−ɛ¯D)≤0(53)V˙≤−12eTJe≤0The above equation illustrates that the overall control scheme is stable sinceV˙is negative semidefinite. Based on Barbalat's lemma [22,28], the tracking error of the system will converge to zero when time tends to infinity, i.e., e→0 as t→∞. □Remark 2: As with the indirect control strategy, the adaptive fuzzy control term ufwithin the direct control scheme is used to ensure asymptotic convergence of the tracking error while the sliding mode control term usis once again used here due to the modeling error between the ideal controller and the fuzzy controller with optimal parameters. Also it is different from the traditional sliding controller since it does not guarantee that the state trajectory will slide along the manifold eTPb=0 as traditionally guaranteed with nonadaptive sliding-mode control [30,31].In the control of wing-rock motion, the rolling is not desired to occur and thus the reference rolling signals are zero and bounded. This requires that the control signals (uf, us) must be bounded. Eqs. (30) and (45) show that the control signals usin the indirect and direct control topologies are bounded, but the bound of the control signals ufneed to be guaranteed by the bound of the parameters QIand QD. In order to avoid the problem that the parameters QIand QDmay drift to infinity over time, the projection algorithm [22] is applied by limiting their upper bound. The constraint set for QIand QDare defined respectively as follows:(54)ϒ1≜{||QI||≤QI0}ϒ2≜{||QD||≤QD0}where QI0 and QD0 are the positive constants. Using the projection algorithm, the adjustment laws of the parameters QIand QDbecome as(55)Q˙IT=−ηIeTPbHif||QI||<QI0orif||QI||=QI0andeTPbQITH≥0−ηIeTPbH+ηIeTPbQITQI||QI||2Hif||QI||=QI0andeTPbQITH<0and(56)Q˙DT=ηDeTPbHif||QD||<QD0orif||QD||=QD0andeTPbHQD≤0ηDeTPbH−ηDeTPbQDTQD||QD||2Hif||QD||=QD0andeTPbHQD>0The utilization of projection algorithm ensures the convergence of the parameter estimates and also guarantees the estimated parameters remain bounded rather than converge to their optimal values. Thus the requirement of the persistently exciting (PE) condition is avoided when the parameters are adjusted as described in Eqs. (55) and (56) during the proposed adaptive control schemes. This is similar to the work [32] where the projection algorithm is employed in the weight updating law of a multilayer NN.Besides, the presence of sgn(·) function in the sliding control term uswill introduce undesired chattering which may excite high frequency dynamics. Here, the saturation function sat(eTPb/ν) is utilized to replace the sgn(eTPb) function for avoiding the undesired chattering. Here ν is an arbitrary small positive constant denoting the width of the boundary layer. With this replacement, the sliding surface function eTPb with an arbitrary initial value will reach and stay within the boundary layer, i.e., eTPb≤ν.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, an indirect and a direct control schemes using ESAFIS are developed for suppression of the wing-rock motion. In the indirect control scheme, the ESAFIS is used to directly approximate the system dynamics and then the controller is constructed based on the approximation function. For the direct control scheme, the ESAFIS is investigated to mimic an ideal controller. In order to compensate for the modelling errors between the ESAFIS approximation models and the ideal models, the sliding controllers are designed for augmenting the fuzzy controllers in the indirect and direct control schemes. For comparison, a RBF control scheme and TS fuzzy control schemes are simulated for the wing rock system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed indirect and direct control schemes can achieve better tracking performance for wing-rock control in terms of error convergence rate and transient results than the RBF control scheme. Compared with the TS fuzzy control schemes, the proposed control schemes using EASFIS achieve smaller roll rate tracking errors initially with little slower convergence rate.
