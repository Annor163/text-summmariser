Our paper contributes to the literature of technology adoption. In most of these models it is assumed that the intensity rate of new arrivals is constant. We extend this approach by assuming that after the last technology jump the intensity of a new arrival can change. Right after the arrival of a new technology the intensity equals a specific value that switches if no new technology arrival has taken place within a certain period after the last technology arrival. We look at different scenarios, dependent on whether the firm is threatened by a drop in the arrival rate after a certain time period or expects the rate to rise. We analyze the effect of a mean preserving spread of the time between two consecutive arrivals on the optimal investment timing and show that larger variance can accelerate investment in case the arrival rate rises while it can decelerate investment in case the arrival rate drops. We find that firms often adopt a new technology a time lag after its introduction, which is a phenomenon frequently observed in practice. Regarding a firm’s technology releasing strategy we explain why additional uncertainty can stimulate customers’ buying behavior. The optimal adoption timing changes significantly, depending on whether the arrival rate is assumed to change or be constant over time. Adding uncertainty about the length of the time period after which the arrival intensity changes, we find that increasing uncertainty accelerates investment, a result that is opposite to the standard real options theory.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The trend in innovation arrivals regarding capabilities of digital electronic devices is strongly linked to the famous statement of Gordon E. Moore about computing hardware. He described that ‘the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years’. Observed over several periods of decades we see that several measures of digital technology are improving at exponential rates related to Moore’s law, including the size, cost, density and speed of components. Processing speed, memory capacity and sensors, all of these are improving at (roughly) exponential rates as well. His law is now used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development. However on the other hand, managers have to consider that this technological innovation progress has natural boundaries. At some point the physical possibilities of improvement are exhausted. This means that the rate of improvements approaches zero at some point. Ignoring this fact, and instead assuming that technological improvements evolve at exponential rates forever, would lead to crucial mistakes in a firm’s technology adoption decisions. However, the literature of technology adoption widely assumes that arrival rates for technological innovations are constant. This assumption has been made among others in Farzin, Huisman, and Kort (1998) and Huisman (2001). In this paper we want to relax this assumption and assume that the arrival rate of technological innovation changes.Another example of technology adoption decisions where arrival rates should not be considered as constant, is typical for the consumer electronics industry. Big companies like Apple, release new improved versions of their most popular electronic devices on a regular basis. Apple released, for example, a first version of the iPod Mini in February 2004 and announced a second generation of the iPod Mini in February of the following year. In September 2005 Apple officially discontinued the iPod Mini line and replaced it by the iPod Nano. The first generation of iPod Nano was replaced by the second generation in September 2006. From then on Apple has updated the iPod Nano on a regular basis every year,11See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipodfor a graphical illustration of the time line of iPod models and the releases of improved versions from 2001 on.while rarely giving information about new products before their official announcement and release. Therewith the company creates additional uncertainty about the release schedules of their new products. From the point of view of a single consumer this means that right after the release of a new iPod Nano generation, one does not expect a new release soon. However, after one year without any release, one would expect Apple to announce a new series of the product line. In this paper we raise the question of how such a product release policy would influence the consumer’s consumption behavior.In this paper, we investigate a firm that decides about technology adoption with an investment to change from old to new technology facing uncertain timing of future technology improvements. The technological process advances exogenously to the firm. A large fixed cost occurs upon the adoption, which becomes a sunk cost because technology choice is irreversible. We assume that the arrival rate is changing over time, unlike the assumption of constant arrival prevalent in the technology adoption literature. Specifically, we assume a specific arrival rate to be present right after the last technology arrival. This arrival rate changes (increase/decrease) to another value if no arrival should take place for a certain time period (of Δ time units) since the last technology arrival. We do not impose a specific ordering of these two values of the arrival rate, which allows to look at two different scenarios that constitute for different technology adoption environments faced by firms or customers.We add to a strand of papers that started with early work of Baldwin (1982), Balcer and Lippman (1984) as well as McCardle (1985). For an extensive survey about decision theoretic models of technology adoption see Huisman (2001) and Hoppe (2002).Our approach to extend the technology adoption literature is closest related to Huisman (2001, Chapter 2). Huisman (2001) introduces an approach to technology adoption timing decisions in a real options context and extends the traditional decision theoretic models on technology adoption with a model in which the technologies arrive according to a Poisson process. We briefly explain Huisman’s basic model, which forms the starting point for our work, in Section 2.1. Huisman (2001) studies the optimal time to irreversibly switch to a new technology when the value and the arrival date of future improvements are uncertain. Technology advances according to a compound Poisson process with constant arrival rate. As in Huisman (2001) we model the technological process with a Poisson process but assume that the arrival rate changes.Three recent papers dealing with technology adoption are Smith and Ulu (2012), Kwon (2010) and Cho and McCardle (2009). Smith and Ulu (2012) study a general model of technology adoption in which time is finite and discrete and a firm faces uncertainty on both costs and quality. They solve their model for three investment decision models: NPV, single adoption, multiple adoption. Due to their general model setup their focus is on deriving structural properties of the value function and the optimal policies. The focus of this paper is to study the effect on the adoption strategy when the arrival rate of new technologies changes over time. Kwon (2010) focuses upon investment and exit decisions of a firm facing a declining profit stream. The firm can continue operation, exit or use the one time option to undertake an investment that boosts the project’s profit rate. This leads to the result that in case of a sufficiently large profit boost upon investment, this investment threshold decreases with volatility. Cho and McCardle (2009) investigate the role of economic and stochastic technological dependence on the adoption of multiple type of new technologies. They show that the dependence among different types of technologies has a material impact on a firm’s adoption decisions. This impact is not unidirectional, it can either delay or expedite the adoption of an improved technology.In this paper we study the technology adoption decision of a single22The main focus is the effect of changing arrival rate on the investment behavior. A natural extension would be to extend to a competitive setting. There is a large strand of literature in which the strategic effects of technology adoption are studied (see Hoppe, 2002; Huisman, 2001).firm in the absence of strategic considerations. We describe the firm’s adoption decision as the solution of an infinite horizon dynamic programming problem in a continuous time setting.33Alvarez and Stenbacka (2001) develop a different mathematical approach based on the Green representation of Markovian functionals for finding the optimal exercise thresholds both of the ordinary real option associated with the updating decision and of the compound real option associated with the incumbent technology.The firm decides about the optimal moment to adopt a new technology, while it currently uses a less efficient technology. The improvement in the value of the available technology follows a compound Poisson process and evolves exogenously to the firm. Technologies become more valuable over time. At each moment in time the firm learns whether an innovation occurs or not.We focus our analysis on the optimal adoption strategies of a firm facing changing arrival rate, also in comparison to the results of a constant arrival rate model. We introduce possible applications and analyze numerical examples suited to those in order to gain more insight about the optimal timing strategy for technology adoption in specific scenarios. Our numerical results suggest that a firm expecting a decrease in the arrival rate after a certain period without any arrival, should apply a different adoption timing strategy than a firm assuming constant arrival rate forever. In case a firm is confronted with a lower arrival rate right after the last technology arrival, it should invest later than a firm that considers constant arrival intensity forever.We find that in some cases the firm optimally adopts a new technology a time lag after the innovation took place. In fact our analysis shows that the probability of a time lag between innovation and adoption can be substantially high. Introducing a model with changing arrival rate allows to account for the fact that firms often adopt new technology a time lag after its arrival. This has been criticized by Cho and McCardle (2009) in the following way: “due to the assumption of the memoryless and stationary probability distribution, their model (Huisman’s (2001) model) does not explain a time lag between the occurrence of an innovation and its adoption”. Doraszelski (2004) gives the same kind of criticism and concludes that the firm may have an incentive to delay adoption of a new technology until it is sufficiently advanced. While McCardle (1985) argues that such a time lag can be explained by a firm’s uncertainty regarding the profit potential of a new technology, we show (as in Balcer and Lippman, 1984) in this paper that such a phenomenon can be also explained by prevalent uncertainty about the arrival of new technology.Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the variance of time between two consecutive technology innovations on the firm’s adoption decision while keeping the expected time between two technology arrivals fixed. The introduction of a changing arrival rate to the basic problem introduced by Huisman (2001) adds to the significance of our results by one additional degree of freedom. Which effect increasing variance has on the technology adoption decision depends on the scenario considered as well as the specific changes in parameters. In case the arrival rate would increase if no new arrival takes place within a certain time period Δ after the last technology arrival, we find that increasing variance by increasing the arrival rate before time Δ while decreasing it after time Δ, decelerates technology adoption. Regarding a firm’s product release strategy we can conclude that it can accelerate the buying behavior of its customers by creating additional uncertainty about its release schedule. In general we find that the effect of the variance on the investment strategy is strongly depending on the specific parameter choices. We therefore conclude that a good assessment of the arrival probabilities is essential. Assuming a constant arrival rate per se can lead to wrong strategy decisions. Furthermore, we find that increasing variance decreases the probability that the firm will adopt a better technology a time lag after it has been introduced.In a further step we generalize the problem so that the moment at which the arrival rate switches is not known to the firm beforehand but assumed to be stochastic. This generalization leads to the result that increasing uncertainty accelerates investment, a result opposite to the standard real options result.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our model with changing arrival rate and characterize the optimal investment policy. Section 3 continues with comparative statics of the optimal adoption policy and presents two numerical examples. In Section 4 we extend our analysis to the fact that the moment of change in arrival rate is not known by the firm but uncertain. Section 5 concludes.In the following we present the technology arrival model that we consider along the paper. We closely follow notation and assumptions presented in Huisman (2001, Chapter 2, single switch case), where a constant instead of a changing arrival rate is assumed. In the remainder of this paper, we refer to this model with constant rate as the standard model.We consider a risk-neutral firm, whose profit flow is determined by its own technology choice. Π(θ) denotes the profit function which is increasing in the technology level, i.e.∂Π∂θ>0. The profit function is assumed to be of a general form and can be either convex or concave.44The profit function could, for example, be derived from a standard Cobb–Douglas production function equal to h(v, θ) = θγva, where v( ≥ 0) is a variable input, θ( ≥ 0) is the efficiency parameter, and a ∈ (0, 1) and γ ≥ 0 represent the constant output elasticities of labor and technology (represented as input capital), respectively. Assuming that the output price and the input price are fixed and equal to p and w, respectively, the profit flow equal Π(θ) = maxv(pθγva− wv). This yields the following expression for the profit flow of the firm, Π(θ) = ϕθb, withφ=(1−a)p11−a(aw)a1−aandb=γ1−a. Depending on γ and a the profit function will be concave or convex in the technological efficiency parameter.The firm maximizes its value over an infinite planning horizon. The discount rate r( > 0) is assumed to be constant. At the beginning of the planning horizon the firm produces with a technology whose efficiency equals ξ0( ≥ 0). As time passes new and more efficient technologies are invented. θtdenotes the efficiency level of the most efficient technology available at this time t. This means that θt− ξ0 denotes the highest possible improvement in technological efficiency available to the firm if it decides to invest at time t. It is assumed that {θt} follows a jump process, such that the jumps are deterministic and positive. More specifically, we consider the stochastic process {(θt, Xt), t ≥ 0} with state spaceR0×[0,∞)such that(1)(θt+dt,Xt+dt)={(θt+u,0)withprobabilityλ(Xt)dt,(θt,Xt+dt)withprobability1−λ(Xt)dt,(2)[3pt]θ0=θ¯,where we assume that θ0 ≥ ξ0 and u > 0. Xtdenotes the time elapsed since the last technological improvement, and the sequence {Xt} is a sequence of inter-renewal times. Moreover, we assume that this is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables.Regarding the arrival rate: we assume that right after a technology arrival has happened the arrival rate is equal to λ1( ≥ 0). If no arrival should happen for a time period of length Δ the arrival rate changes to λ2( > 0). λ2 is assumed to be strictly positive. We will denote the interval between the last arrival and Δ region 1 and the interval after Δ region 2. Therefore, the arrival rate is formally given by(3)λ(x)=λ11{x<Δ}+λ21{x≥Δ},where 1{A} is equal to one if A is true. We remark that if in Equation (3) we set Δ = ∞, so that λ(Xt) is constant and equal to λ1, we recover the case addressed by Huisman (2001), the standard model.Considering the changing arrival rate, the process {(θt, Xt), t ≥ 0}, as defined in Equation (1), is a non-stationary Poisson process. This process belongs to the group of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes that were formally addressed as a class of processes by Davis (1984).55We thank Steven Shreve for referring to this strand of literature.The time between consecutive technology arrivals, hereby denoted by Y, is given by(4)Y∼Y11{Y1<Δ}+(Δ+Y2)1{Y1≥Δ},with(5)Y1∼Exp(λ1),Y2∼Exp(λ2),and independent. Δ is set to be constant for the moment. This approach allows us to model a range of practical problems we had in mind, for example the characteristics in technological innovation process in the CPU transistor industry or the product release strategy of an electronics company, while maintaining still a certain degree of analytical tractability of the problem. In Section 4 we will extend the presented model assuming random Δ.The following proposition gives the expected value and variance of the time elapsed between consecutive arrivals. The proofs of all propositions are given in Appendix B.Proposition 1The expected value and variance of Y are given by(6)E[Y]=Δ+1λ2,(7)Var[Y]=1λ22,for λ1 = 0 and(8)E[Y]=1λ1(1−e−λ1Δ(1+λ1Δ))+e−λ1Δ(1λ2+Δ),(9)Var[Y]=1λ12(1+1λ22e−2Δλ1(λ1−λ2)λ2+1λ22e−2Δλ1(λ1−λ2)λ1(−1+2eΔλ1(1+Δλ2)),for λ1 > 0.The expected value (Equation (8)) is equal to the weighted average of the two arrival rates λ1 and λ2, where the weights reflect the probabilities of ending up in each region. For example,e−λ1Δis the probability of having an arrival in region 2. Since the probability of having an arrival in region 2 equals 1 in the special case that λ1 = 0, Equation (8) simplifies to Equation (6). As in Huisman (2001) we will also assume that the firm cannot influence the innovation itself, i.e. the arrival rate is assumed exogenous to the firm.The firm can adopt a new technology by paying a sunk cost I( > 0). For simplicity and tractability we assume that the firm can invest only once.The problem addressed concerns the timing of the firm’s technology switch. The firm needs to decide when to change from producing with old technology ξ0 to producing with an improved one. The problem the firm faces is an optimal stopping problem, defined mathematically as follows:(10)F(ξ0,θ¯,x)=supτE[∫0τΠ(ξ0)e−rsds+e−rτV(θτ,τ)|θ0=θ¯,X0=x]∫0τ],where(11)V(θ,t)=∫t∞Π(θ)e−r(s−t)ds−I,is the termination payoff at time t, which is equal to the firm’s value at the moment (t) it adopts the technology with value θ. For ease of notation we will denote V(θ, 0) simply by V(θ) throughout the rest of the paper. Here stopping means that the firm invests and thus adopts a new technology and continuation resembles waiting with investing. We are looking for the optimal time τ that maximizes the expected value of the firm, which is denoted byF(ξ0,θ¯,x).In the standard model, as shown in Huisman (2001), there is a unique value of θtfor which the firm is indifferent between investing and waiting. Moreover, we can show that this adoption threshold is increasing in the arrival rate λ for concave profit flow functions. We will use this result multiple times in proofs concerning the changing arrival rate case. This result is supported numerically in Huisman (2001).Proposition 2For concave profit function Π(.), the optimal adoption threshold is increasing in the arrival rate, i.e., if θ*(λ) denotes the threshold when the arrival rate is λ then for λ1 < λ2 it follows that:(12)θ*(λ1)<θ*(λ2).Firms facing higher speed of innovations are investing in better technologies. However, one cannot conclude automatically that they also invest later, since both the speed of arrival and the desired technology level are increasing. Still in the standard model, we are able to prove that the firm will adopt a new technology only at its arrival date:Proposition 3In the standard model, the set of decision moments is equal to {t: Xt= 0}.Adopting a technology sometime after its arrival could only be optimal if either investment costs would go down, the firm would neglect discounting or it could gain information about the likelihood of the next arrival by waiting.In case the arrival rate changes over time, there are two moments for each new technology at which the firm should consider adoption. The first one is still the moment of arrival of new technology. The second is the moment that the arrival rate changes in case Δ time units have passed since the last arrival without any new technology arrival, i.e. at Xt= Δ. Proposition 4 determines the set of decision moments formally.Proposition 4If the arrival rate of new technologies is defined by Equation (3), the set of decision moments of the optimal stopping problem in (10) is equal to {t: Xt= 0 or Xt= Δ}.The fact that the decision moment Xt= Δ has to be considered now as well can easily be understood by considering the case where the arrival rate would drop to zero at that time, i.e. λ2 = 0. The firm then faces a now or never decision if Δ time units have passed since the last arrival of new technology. In this case the firm will only adopt the technology if the discounted value generated by the increase in profit flow exceeds the investment cost (classic net present value rule).In deriving the optimal investment strategy, both decision moments have to be taken into account and, therefore, corresponding decision thresholds need to be determined. In particular, at the decision moment Xt= Δ the decision threshold, denoted byθ2*,is defined as the value of θ for which the firm is indifferent between investing now at Xt= Δ or after the next technology arrival. Therefore,(13)Π(θ2*)r−I=Π(ξ0)r+λ2+λ2r+λ2(Π(θ2*+u)r−I).Since at decision moment Xt= Δ just the arrival rate λ2 has to be considered, the threshold equation is equal to the standard problem with λ = λ2. At the decision moment Xt= 0 the idea of deriving the trigger is the same. Atθ1*the firm is indifferent between investing now or after the next technology arrival. At this decision moment both arrival possibilities have to be considered. It can either be the case that the next technology arrival takes place before Δ time units have passed or after Δ time units have passed. The former we refer to in the following as “arrival of type 1” and the latter as “arrival of type 2”. The resulting value matching curve is presented in the following equation.(14)Π(θ1*)r−I=(1−e−(r+λ1)Δ)(Π(ξ0)r+λ1+λ1r+λ1(Π(θ1*+u)r−I))+e−(r+λ1)Δ(max(Π(θ1*)r−I,Π(ξ0)r+λ2+λ2r+λ2(Π(θ1*+u)r−I))).This equation states that the firm is indifferent between the following two strategies. The first strategy is adopting the technology with efficiencyθ1*.The second strategy consists of the following two parts: (1) adopting the next technology whenever there is an arrival before time Δ and (2) when there is no arrival before time Δ the firm either adopts the technology with efficiencyθ1*at time Δ or adopts the next technology.The following proposition, verified in Appendix B, states the uniqueness of the thresholdsθ1*andθ2*,provided they exist.Proposition 5If the profit flow is a concave function in the technology level θ, the thresholdsθ1*andθ2*at the decision moments Xt= 0 and Xt= Δ are unique if those exist. If the profit flow is convex, then the uniqueness conditioned on existence also holds as long as it holds for the standard cases (both with arrival rate λ = λ1 and arrival rate λ = λ2).Considering these two thresholds the optimal investment strategy can be formalized as follows: If a new technology arrives that has efficiency θ withθ>θ1*it is optimal for the firm to adopt that technology at the moment of arrival. Moreover, if the efficiency of the latest technology is larger thanθ2*when the arrival rate changes, it is also optimal for the firm to adopt that technology. Due to the fact that there is a max operator in Equation (14) we conclude that there are two candidates for thresholdθ1*which we define byθ1Δ,*andθ10,*,respectively. The following equations define the two candidates(15)Π(θ1Δ,*)r−I=(1−e−(r+λ1)Δ)(Π(ξ0)r+λ1+λ1r+λ1×(Π(θ1Δ,*+u)r−I))+e−(r+λ1)Δ(Π(θ1Δ,*)r−I),(16)Π(θ10,*)r−I=(1−e−(r+λ1)Δ)(Π(ξ0)r+λ1+λ1r+λ1(Π(θ10,*+u)r−I))+e−(r+λ1)Δ(Π(ξ0)r+λ2+λ2r+λ2(Π(θ10,*+u)r−I)).Proposition 6 describes the optimal investment strategy of the firm distinguishing the two possible cases λ1 < λ2 and λ1 > λ2:Proposition 6For the optimal investment strategy the firm considers two different scenarios:1.If λ1 < λ2, thresholdθ1*is the solution of Equation (16). The firm does not consider thresholdθ2*because thresholdθ1*will always be reached first.If λ1 > λ2, thresholdθ1*is the solution of Equation (15).θ2*is given by the solution of Equation (13). Considering both thresholds, the firm will invest as soon as3.Δ time units have elapsed since the last technology arrival andθ2*has been reached orθ1*has been reached.Simplifying Equation (15) leads to(17)Π(θ1Δ,*)r−I=Π(ξ0)r+λ1+λ1r+λ1(Π(θ1Δ,*+u)r−I).This indicates that thresholdθ1*for case λ1 > λ2 is not depending on Δ. This can be explained by the two contrary effects of Δ onθ1Δ,*: on the one hand, the probability of having an arrival in region 1 increases in Δ. Since the arrival rate in region 2 is strictly smaller than the one in region 1, it results that thresholdθ1Δ,*increases. On the other hand, the expected time between arrivals in region 1 given by1λ1(1−e−λ1Δ(1+λ1Δ)),increases in Δ. In view of Proposition 2 we know that the threshold is a decreasing function of the expected time between arrivals. Taking into account only region 1 and using the analogy with the standard case we conclude thatθ1Δ,*is decreasing in the expected time between arrivals. These two effects cancel each other.The relation of the two arrival rate parameters λ1 and λ2 directly specifies the relation of the two thresholdsθ1*andθ2*.Proposition 7If λ1 > λ2 then the following relation between the two thresholds of region 1 and region 2, respectively, holds:θ1*>θ2*,withθ1*implicitly given by Equation (15). If λ1 < λ2 then it holds thatθ1*<θ2*,withθ1*implicitly given by Equation (16).Proposition 7 shows that the threshold in the region with the lowest arrival rate is the smallest. A direct results of this is that it is possible that there occurs a time lag between a new technology innovation and its adoption in case that the arrival rate drops from region 1 to region 2, which is formulated in the following corollary.Corollary 1If λ2 < λ1 it is optimal for the firm to invest Δ time units after the last technology innovation if the actual technology level has increased up to levelθ2*and Δ time units have elapsed since the last innovation without having reached thresholdθ1*yet. The probability that the firm would adopt a technology Δ time units after its arrival is strictly positive.In case the arrival rate drops after Δ time units have elapsed the firm speculates on arrivals in region 1 by setting the threshold for that region high. However, if the firm ends up in region 2 it will accept a technology with a lower efficiency due to the low probability of a new arrival. Taking into account this investment strategy one can formulate the firm’s value function. The expression of the value function is stated in Table 1. In case of changing arrival rate there are two cases to be distinguished. For the case λ1 < λ2 the firm will consider adoption of new technology only at the arrival of new technology once the thresholdθ1*is reached. Therefore, the value function is split into three different parts similar to the case with constant arrival rate (see Equation (22) in Table 1). The value in the stopping region is equal to the termination payoff V(θ), while we distinguish two cases considering the continuation region. The first term of the value function in the continuation region (θ<θ1*) is the discount factor. The investment takes place in the future and therefore, the net present value at the moment of investment has to be properly discounted. The factor(λ1r+λ1(1−e−Δ(r+λ1))+λ2e−Δ(r+λ1)r+λ2)is the discounted value of one unit of money that the firms receives after the next technology arrival (see Lemma 2 in Appendix B). This factor is raised to the power⌈θ1*−θu⌉because it takes (continuously spoken) exactly that many arrivals before the conditional stopping region is reached.For the case that λ1 > λ2 the firm will invest either as soon asθ2*is reached and Δ time units have passed since the last technology has arrived (i.e. the decision moment Xt= Δ is reached), or at the moment the new technology has arrived and the thresholdθ1*was reached already. The value function for this case is split into three different regions as illustrated in Fig. 1. The expression of the value function for this case is stated in Equation (23) of Table 1.Forθ<θ2*the firm is in the continuation region, where the optimal action is to wait for further technology arrivals. Therefore, the value of the firm in this region is equal to the value of the firm in regionθ2*+u>θ≥θ2*discounted back to the actual time. Ifθ≥θ1*the firm is in the stopping region, where it is optimal to undertake investment immediately. Therefore, the value of the firm is equal to the termination payoff V(θ). But there is another region in between these two, i.e.θ2*≤θ<θ1*,where it is optimal to undertake investment only if Δ time units have passed since the last technology arrival without any new one. Otherwise, it is optimal to wait. We call this region the ‘conditional stopping region’. The value of the firm in this region depends on the number of arrivals that are still necessary to reach the thresholdθ1*. We denote that by (m* − j), where j is the number of arrivals that took place sinceθ2*has been reached.m*=⌈θ1*−θ2*u⌉denotes the number of jumps that separate the thresholdsθ2*andθ1*. Forθ2*≤θ<θ1*the firm will undertake investment Δ time units after its arrival only if no new technology has arrived until then. The value function has to be split into m* subparts here. For the case that j technology arrivals (with 1 ≤ j ≤ m*) are required in order to reach the thresholdθ1*,j scenarios have to be taken into account for the definition of the value function in this subpart. The value function is equal to the probability that the next m* − j arrivals are all in region 1 times the expected value the firm would receive by investing at the decision moment Xt= 0 after these m* arrivals have taken place, plus all possible combinations that the next i = 0, …, (m* − j) arrivals are in region 1 and the (i + 1)th arrival is in region 2, times the expected value that the firm gets if it invests at decision moment Xt= Δ after the ith technology arrival took place.Knowing the optimal adoption triggers we will derive the expected value of the adoption time T*. To compare the models with constant arrival rate and changing arrival rate we first state the expected time of adoption for the model with constant arrival rate as shown in Huisman (2001). Therefore, let(18)n(θ)=⌈θ−ξ0u⌉,Then it follows that T* is just the sum of n(θ*) i.i.d. exponential random variables, with rate λ, and therefore(19)E[T☆]=n(θ*)λ.where θ⋆ is the optimal investment level derived by Huisman (2001).For the model with changing arrival rate, let M denote an integer value, and letE[t*](M)denote the expected time of adoption given that M jumps occurred before the adoption of the new technology. Remark that these M jumps can occur as a combination of jumps when the arrival rate is λ1 and λ2; in the first case the expected time between consecutive arrivals is 1/λ1, whereas in the second it is Δ + 1/λ2. Thus, given that M jumps occurred, we have(20)E[t*](M)=∑n=0M(nM)(nλ1+M−nλ2+(M−n)Δ)×[P(Y<Δ)]n[P(Y>Δ)]M−n,where Y is the time elapsed between consecutive arrivals, so that(21)P(Y<Δ)=1−e−λ1Δ.The following proposition gives expressions for the expected value of T* assuming a changing arrival rate for innovation.Proposition 8Letn(θ)=⌈θ−ξ0u⌉,that is the number of steps necessary to reach a technology level of θ starting at current technology level ξ0. Concerning the expected time of adoption we have the following results:•Case 1:If λ1 ≤ λ2 the firm will just consider adoption of a new technology immediately after a technology arrival happens, i.e. it just considersθ1*. Therefore, the expected time of adoption is given by the expected time ofn(θ)=⌈θ−ξ0u⌉technology arrivals to happen, which is given by(24)E[T*]=E[t*](n(θ1*)).Case 2:If λ1 > λ2 the firm will either invest as soon as investment thresholdθ1*is reached or at the moment that thresholdθ2*is reached and region 2 has been entered again, i.e. Δ has passed since the last technology arrival. For this case the expected time of technology adoption is given by expected time to reach thresholdθ2*plus the expected time to either reach thresholdθ1*or enter region 2 before. This is formally given by:(25)E[T*]=E[t*](n(θ2*))+∑j=0m*−1(jλ1+Δ)(1−e−Δλ1)je−Δλ1+m*λ1(1−e−Δλ1)m*,withm*=⌈θ1*−θ2*u⌉.For the special case that λ1 = 0 the expected value of the adoption time T* is equal to(26)E[T*]=n(θ2*)Δ+1λ2.
