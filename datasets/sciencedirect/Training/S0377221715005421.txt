@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We present a general construction that allows to extend a given subcopula to a copula in such a way that the extension is affine on some specific segments of the copula domain. This construction is hence applied to provide convergence theorems for approximating a copula in strong convergence and in D1-metric (related to the Markov kernel representation of a copula).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Copulas are multivariate probability distribution functions whose univariate margins are uniformly distributed on the unit interval [0, 1]. They represent one of the building blocks of (modern) multivariate analysis since Sklar showed that the probability law of any random vector X can be expressed as a composition of the distribution functions of all one-dimensional margins and a suitable copula (Faugeras, 2013; Rüschendorf, 2009; Sklar, 1959). This fact has provided to be useful in various applications including decision science (see, e.g., Abbas, 2013) and reliability theory (see, e.g., Gupta, Misra, & Kumar, 2015; Navarro, Pellerey, & Crescenzo, 2015; Rychlik, 2010).Now, while the copula associated with X is unique when the margins are continuous, in the non-continuous case we should take into account that various copulas can be associated with X. In fact, every copula associated with a non-continuous random vector X is uniquely determined only on a Borel set A⊂[0, 1]d. This fact poses the natural question of how it is possible to construct a copula given some partial information about the values that it assumes on specific subsets of the domain [0, 1]d(see, for instance, Carley & Taylor, 2002). In this respect, one of the most common extension procedures is given by the multilinear interpolation (or checkerboard construction), originally proposed by Schweizer and Sklar (1974) and, further, developed by Carley and Taylor (2002), and Genest, Nešlehová, and Rémillard (2014). In fact, as shown by Genest and Nešlehová (2007) and Nešlehová (2007), this extension plays a central role in characterizing dependence concepts for discrete random vectors.The aim of this paper is to contribute to the development of extension procedures that include previously introduced methodologies (e.g., checkerboard), but are naturally presented in a high-dimensional framework. Our starting point is represented by the fact that many of these constructions can be generally classified as patchwork copulas (Durante, Fernández-Sánchez, & Sempi, 2013; Durante, Saminger-Platz, & Sarkoci, 2009). Roughly speaking, a patchwork copula is any copula that is obtained by modifying the probability measure associated with a given copula CBin several given subsets of its domain in a way that is specified by other copulasC1,⋯,Cn. Following this approach, we present hence a general construction that allows to extend a specific subcopula to a copula (Section 2). Moreover, we also provide some convergence results in order to check how these extensions approximate (in different metrics) a given copula (Section 3).Throughout the paper, the natural number d ≥ 2 will denote the dimension,I:=[0,1],B(Id)the Borel-σ-field onId,and λdthe Lebesgue measure onB(Id).For basic definitions and properties of measure theory (including Disintegration Theorem), we refer to Ash (2000) and Billingsley (1995). For basic definitions and properties of copulas, we refer to Durante and Sempi (2015) and Nelsen (2006).We recall that the space of copulas is in one-to-one correspondence with the space of all probability measures μ onB(Id)that are d-fold stochastic, i.e. such that all one-dimensional marginalsμπicoincide with λ, the Lebesgue measure onB(I),wherebyμπidenotes the push-forward of μ under the ith canonical projection πi.In order to introduce our concepts, we need some preliminary notations.Given a fixed natural number d ≥ 2, let n1,…,ndbe d natural numbers, and, for everyk∈{1,⋯,d},leta0k,a1k,…,ankkbe numbers inIsuch that0=a0k<a1k<⋯<ankk=1.Consider the meshD:=×k=1d{a0k,a1k,⋯,ankk}=×k=1dIk,which dividesIdinto∏i=1dnid-boxes(1)B(i1,i2,⋯,id):=[ai11,ai1+11]×[ai22,ai2+12]⋯×[aidd,aid+1d],where for everyk∈{1,2,⋯,d},ik∈{0,⋯,nk−1}. The norm of the mesh D is defined by∥D∥=maxk,ik(aik+1k−aikk). A mesh D′ is a refinement of D when D ⊆ D′.Moreover, for everyk∈{1,2,⋯,d}and everyik∈{0,1,⋯,nk−1},consider the functionfikk:I→Igiven by(2)fikk(x):={0,x<aikk,x−aikkaik+1k−aikk,aikk≤x≤aik+1k,1,x>aik+1k.For the multi-indexi=(i1,⋯,id)∈I={0,1,⋯,n1−1}×⋯×{0,1,⋯,nd−1},we definefi:Id→Idviafi(u)=(fi11(u1),⋯,fidd(ud)).We are now able to give the following definition.Definition 2.1Let S be a subcopula with domain D. For eachi∈I,consider a measure μionB(Id). Define the measure μ onB(Id)such that for every Borel setB∈B(Id),one has(3)μ(B)=∑i∈Iβiμi(fi(B∩Bi)),where βiis equal to the S-volume of Bi, i.e.βi=VS(Bi).Notice that the set-function μ is a bona fide measure because each μiis a measure. Moreover, the following result holds.Proposition 2.1Under the assumptions of Definition2.1, suppose that, for eachi∈I,μiis a probability measure such thatμi(]0,1[d)=1. Then μ defined by (3) is a probability measure. Moreover, if each μiis d-fold stochastic, so is μ.Obviously, μ is a measure and, since each μihas no mass on the border ofId,it follows easily that the total mass of μ is 1.Moreover, consider the case when each μiis d-fold stochastic. Letu1∈Isuch thatai11≤u1≤ai1+11. LetB=[0,u1]×Id−1=([0,ai11]×Id−1)∪(∪j∈I′(Bj∩B)),where the setI′is formed by all indicesj=(j1,⋯,jd)withj1=i1. Thus, it holdsμ([0,u1]×Id−1)=S(ai11,1,⋯,1)+∑j∈I′βju1−ai11ai1+11−ai11=ai11+u1−ai11ai1+11−ai11(ai1+11−ai11)=u1,because, for everyj∈I′,μj(fj(B∩Bj))=μj([0,u1−ai11ai1+11−ai11]×Id−1)=u1−ai11ai1+11−ai11.By repeating the above procedure for each coordinate, we have the desired assertion.□Roughly speaking, the measure μ defined by (3) is obtained by putting together several measures, each of them acting in one single set of a given partition of the domainId. The only constraint is provided by the subcopula S, which fixes the value of the measure at each box whose vertices belong to the mesh D.From now on, we are interested in measures μ of type (3) that are generated by d-fold stochastic measures(μi)i∈I. In this case, the explicit expression of the copula C related to μ is given by the following result.Proposition 2.2Under the assumptions of Definition2.1, suppose that, for eachi∈I,μiis a d-fold stochastic measure. Moreover, Cidenotes the copula associated to the measure μi. Then the copula associated to the measure μ can be written, for everyu ∈ Biwithi∈I,by(4)C(u)=S(ai11,⋯,aidd)+∑j∈IiβjCj(fj(u)).Here the setIiis formed by all indicesj=(j1,⋯,jd)with jk≤ ik for everyk=1,2,⋯,d,andjk=ikfor at least one index k.Let u ∈ Bi. Then [0, u] can be decomposed into the following union of boxes whose interiors are disjoint:(5)[0,u]=([0,ai11]×⋯×[0,aidd])∪(∪j∈Ii(Bj∩[0,u])).Thus, we haveC(u)=μ([0,ai11]×⋯×[0,aidd])+∑j∈Iiβjμj(fj([aj11,u1]×⋯×[ajdd,ud]))=S(ai11,⋯,aidd)+∑j∈IiβjCj(fj(u)),which is the desired assertion.□It easily follows thatC=Son the mesh D. Moreover, letu=(u1,ai22,⋯,aidd)be in Bi. Let [0, u] be decomposed as in (5). Ifj∈Ii1,thenβjCj(fj11(u1),fj22(ai22),⋯,fjdd(aidd))=βju1−ai11ai1+11−ai11.HenceC(u)−C(ai11,ai22,⋯,aidd)=μ([0,u])−S(ai11,ai22,⋯,aidd)=u1−ai11ai1+11−ai11∑j∈Ii1βj=u1−ai11ai1+11−ai11μ([ai11,ai1+11]×[0,ai22]×⋯×[0,aidd])=u1−ai11ai1+11−ai11(S(ai1+11,ai22,…,aidd)−S(ai11,ai22,⋯,aidd)).By repeating the above procedure for each coordinate, it follows that the extension of the subcopula S to the copula C provided by (4) is linear along segments joining two points in the mesh D such that(d−1)of their components are equal.For such a reason, the copula C defined by (4) is called the L-extension of S by means of(Ci)i∈I, where the prefix “L” indicates that such extension is linear on specific segments of the copula domain. We writeC=〈D,Ci〉i∈ISor, with the measure notation,μ=〈D,μi〉i∈IS.LetC=〈D,Ci〉i∈IS. If every Ciis absolutely continuous (respectively, singular), then C is absolutely continuous (respectively, singular). In particular, if every Ciequals the independence copula Πd, C corresponds to the checkerboard copula construction, or multilinear copula extension (Carley & Taylor, 2002; Genest et al., 2014; Ghosh & Henderson, 2009; Johnson & Kotz, 2007).Remark 2.1The L-extension of a subcopula is qualitatively different from the notion of empirical copula (see, e.g., Deheuvels, 1979) and possible other kernel-based modifications (see, e.g., Fermanian, Radulović, & Wegkamp, 2004; Omelka, Gijbels, & Veraverbeke, 2009). In fact, the L-extension is a copula, while both the empirical copula and its smoothing versions are either discontinuous or do not have uniform univariate margins.It is known from Genest and Nešlehová (2007, Proposition 11) that (bivariate) checkerboard copulas satisfy some positive dependence properties. In the case of the constructions presented here, the following generalization holds. We recall that a copula C is said to be positive lower orthant dependent (PLOD) if C(u) ≥ Πd(u) for allu∈Id(see, for instance, Nelsen, 2006).Proposition 2.3Let C be a copula given by (4). Suppose that each Cjis PLOD, and S has the property thatS(ai11,…,aidd)≥∏h=1daihhfor every(i1,…,id)∈I. Then C is PLOD.From (4) and the hypotheses, we haveC(u)=S(ai11,…,aidd)+∑j∈IiβjCj(fj(u))≥S(ai11,…,aidd)+∑j∈Iiβjfj1(u1)⋯fjd(ud)=S(ai11,…,aidd)+VS(×h=1d[aihh,aih+1h])·∏h=1duh−aihhaih+1h−aihh+∑h=1dVS(×l=1h−1[aill,ail+1l]×[aihh,aihh]×l=h+1d[aill,ail+1l])·∏m≠hm=1dum−aimmaim+1m−aimm+⋯+∑h=1dVS(×l=1h−1[aill,aill]×[aihh,aih+1h]×l=h+1d[aill,aill])·uh−aihhaih+1h−aihh,whereVS(×l=1h−1[aill,ail+1l]×[aihh,aihh]×l=h+1d[aill,ail+1l])should be intended as the volume of the(d−1)-marginal subcopula S′ derived from S by setting equal to 1 the hth component of S (and, analogously, for the other cases).Then it follows thatC(u)≥S(ai11,…,aidd)[1+(−1)d∏h=1duh−aihhaih+1h−aihh+(−1)d−1∑h=1d∏l≠hl=1dul−aillail+1l−aill+⋯−∑h=1duh−aihhaih+1h−aihh]+∑l=1dS(ai11,…,ail−1l−1,ail+1l,ail+1l+1,…,aidd)·[(−1)d−1∏h=1duh−aihhaih+1h−aihh+(−1)d−2ul−aillail+1l−aill·∑m≠lm=1d∏p≠l,mp=1dup−aippaip+1p−aipp+⋯+ul−aillail+1l−aill]+⋯+S(ai1+11,…,aid+1d)·∏h=1duh−aihhaih+1h−aihh.The right hand side of this inequality may be written asS(ai11,…,aidd)·∏h=1d(1−uh−aihhaih+1h−aihh)+∑h=1dS(ai11,…,aih−1h−1,aih+1h,aih+1h+1,…,aidd)·uh−aihhaih+1h−aihh·∏l≠hl=1d(1−ul−aillail+1l−aill)+⋯+S(ai1+11,…,aid+1d)·∏h=1duh−aihhaih+1h−aihh≥[∏h=1daihh(aih+1h−uh)+∑h=1d(uh−aihh)∏l≠hl=1daill(ail+1l−ul)+⋯+∏h=1daih+1h(uh−aihh)]∏h=1d(aih+1h−aihh)=∏h=1duh(aih+1h−aihh)∏h=1d(aih+1h−aihh)=∏h=1duh,and the proof is completed.□Notice that the conditionS(ai11,…,aidd)≥∏h=1daihhis necessary in order to guarantee that C is PLOD. Moreover, the previous result is also valid when we replace PLOD by the negative dependence notion of NLOD. The proof can be obtained by reversing the sense of the inequalities.Here we illustrate the consequences of the previous results in the cased=2.Setd=2. Fork=1,2,consider0=a0k<a1k<⋯<ankk=1,andIk={aik:i=0,⋯,nk}. Thus, the expression given by (4) can be rewritten as(6)C(u1,u2)=S(ai11,ai22)+βi1i2Ci1i2(u1−ai11ai1+11−ai11,u2−ai22ai2+12−ai22)+u1−ai11ai1+11−ai11(S(ai1+11,ai22)−S(ai11,ai22))+u2−ai22ai2+12−ai22(S(ai11,ai2+12)−S(ai11,ai22))for every(u1,u2)∈Bi1i2.As can be easily checked, the restriction of C to each segment joining(ai11,0)and(ai11,1)(respectively,(0,ai22)and(1,ai22)) is piecewise linear. Specifically, the construction in Eq. (6) is related to the patchwork construction presented in Durante et al. (2013) (see also (Durante et al., 2009)). For any copula CB(the so-called background copula), patchwork techniques allow to construct all the copulas that coincide with CBon the gridΓ=(I1×I)∪(I×I2). In particular, the copula C given by (6) is obtained by means of patchwork techniques when CBis piecewise linear along the segments that forms Γ. As such, it can be simulated by using the methods presented in Durante et al. (2013). Examples are provided in Fig. 1. Notice that such copulas exhibit various types of asymmetries (especially, in the tails), a feature of interest in many applications (see, e.g., Grundke & Polle, 2012; Kakouris & Rustem, 2014; Wu, 2014).In the literature, special choices ofCi1i2in Eq. (6) have produced different constructions. For instance, if eachCi1i2is the Fréchet upper bound, then one obtains the check-min copulas. Instead, if eachCi1i2is a Fréchet copula, then one obtains the construction in Zheng, Yang, and Huang (2011). Recently, a general construction of this type has been proposed by Chaidee, Santiwipanont, and Sumetkijakan (2015) by using probabilistic arguments and similar expressions as in Eq. (6). These constructions may also be used in order to determine various copulas that can be associated with a non-continuous random vector via Sklar’s Theorem, as the following example shows.Example 2.1Consider a random pair (X, Y) with joint distribution function H and univariate margins FXand FY. Assume thatRange(FX)={0,a1,1}andRange(FY)={0,b1,1}. Then the copula of (X, Y) is uniquely defined only onD=Range(FX)×Range(FY). Moreover, a subcopula S is defined on D viaS(u,v)=H(FX−1(u),FY−1(v)),whereF−1denotes the quantile inverse of a distribution function F. Then, all the L-extensions of type{〈D,Ci〉Si∈I:Ciisa2-copula}represent possible copulas that can be associated to (X, Y) by providing alternatives to the multilinear copula extension (see Fig. 2for a graphical illustration).Another important aspect is that Eq. (6) uses only the values that the subcopula S assumes on the mesh D. In particular, if one sets mijequal to the S-volume of each box of type[ai1,ai+11]×[aj2,aj+12]for everyi=0,1,…,n1−1andj=0,1,⋯,n2−1,it is possible to identify a (n1 × n2)-matrixM=(mij)such that the sum of all its entries is equal to 1. Moreover, this M is such that•the sum of all entries of the i-row is equal toai1−a1i−1;the sum of all entries of the j-column is equal toaj2−a2j−1.Whenn1=n2=nand each box of type (1) is a square of area 1/n2, then the matrix nM, obtained by multiplying each entry of the matrix by n, is doubly stochastic, i.e. the sum of all the entries in each row (respectively, each column) is equal to 1 (see Marshall, Olkin, & Arnold, 2011).The construction previously introduced can also be used as a tool to determine an approximation of a given copula C with respect to a mesh D and a sequence of copulas(Ci)i∈I. In fact, if C is a copula, we may consider the subcopula SCthat coincides with the restriction of C to D. Starting from it, we may obtain the copula CDthat is the L-extension of SCby means of(Ci)i∈I. In such a case, CDis called the(D,(Ci)i∈I)-approximation of C. It is hence of interest to check whether such approximations converge (in some sense) to the starting copula C. We begin with the case of pointwise convergence of copulas (which is equivalent to uniform convergence).Theorem 3.1Let C be a copula. Let(Dn)n∈Nbe a sequence of meshes such that, for everyn∈N,Dn⊆Dn+1,and ‖Dn‖ → 0 asn→+∞. Let((Cin)i∈In)n∈Nbe a collection of sequences of copulas such thatInis obtained from Dn as inSection 2. Let Cn be the(Dn,(Cin)i∈In)-approximation of C. Then Cn converges pointwise to C asn→+∞.If C is a d-dimensional copula, for everyn∈N,it holdssupu∈Id|C(u)−Cn(u)|≤d·∥Dn∥,from which the pointwise convergence follows.□Notice that the previous result cannot be extended to other topologies defined in the space of copulas. Consider, for example, the so-called strong convergence of measures. It is known that a sequence of finite Borel measures(μn)n∈Nconverges strongly to μ if, and only if, for everyB∈B(Id),μn(B) → μ(B) asn→+∞. The following example holds.Example 3.1For everyn∈N,letJ1,n=J2,n={in:0≤i≤n}. Let Cnbe the(J1,n×J2,n,(Cijn)(i,j)∈{0,1,⋯,n−1}2)-approximation of the comonotonicity copula M2, where eachC(i,j)nis equal to the independence copula Π2. Let Δ be the set of all points on the diagonal ofI2,i.e.Δ={(x,x):x∈I}. ThenμM2(Δ)=1,whileμCn(Δ)=0for everyn∈N. Thus, Cndoes not converge strongly to M2. Notice that all Cnare actually ordinal sums (Durante & Sempi, 2015; Mesiar & Sempi, 2010).However, the strong convergence is guaranteed under additional assumptions. To this end, we need the following result.Lemma 3.2Let C be an absolutely continuous copula. Let(Dn)n∈Nbe a sequence of meshes such that, for everyn∈N,Dn⊆Dn+1,and ‖Dn‖ → 0 asn→+∞. Let((Cin)i∈In)n∈Nbe a collection of sequences of absolutely continuous copulas whose densities are all bounded by a constant T. Let Cn be the(Dn,(Cin)i∈In)-approximation of C. Then, for every open setB∈B(Id),μCn(B)converges to μC(B) asn→+∞.Let B be an open set inB(Id). For everyn∈N,let Bnbe the largest union of boxesBin(from Dn) contained in B. Obviously, εn:= λd(B∖Bn) > 0, and εntends to 0 as n → ∞.First, we show that μC(Bn) → μC(B) asn→+∞. To this end, let δnbe the μC-measure of all points inIdsuch that the density c of C is greater than1/ɛn. Since C is absolutely continuous, then δntends to 0 asn→+∞. SetA1:={u∈B∖Bn:c(u)≤1/ɛn}andA2=(B∖Bn)∖A1. It follows thatμC(B∖Bn)=∫A1c(u)dλd(u)+∫A2c(u)dλd(u)≤λd(B∖Bn)1ɛn+δn,which tends to 0 asn→+∞. Moreover,|μCn(Bn)−μCn(B)|can be taken arbitrarily small becauseμCn(B∖Bn)≤Tɛn.Therefore, sinceμC(Bn)=μCn(Bn)for each n, it holds|μC(B)−μCn(B)|=|μC(B)−μC(Bn)+μCn(Bn)−μCn(B)|≤|μC(B)−μC(Bn)|+|μCn(Bn)−μCn(B)|,and the desired assertion follows.□Under the same assumptions of Lemma3.2, for everyB∈B(Id),μCn(B)converges to μC(B) asn→+∞.Let B be inB(Id). Then there exists a sequence of open sets Orsuch that λd(Or) tends to λd(B) asr→+∞. Moreover, since μCis absolutely continuous, by similar arguments as in the proof of Lemma 3.2, it follows that μC(Or) tends to μC(B) asr→+∞(and, the analogous result holds for Cn). Let us construct a sequence(kn)n≥2⊂Nby recurrence in the following way. Take k2 such that, for every k ≥ k2, it holds|μCk(O2)−μC(O2)|<12.Givenkr−1,take krsuch thatkr>kr−1and, for every k ≥ kr, it holds|μCk(Or)−μC(Or)|<1r.Finally, define the sequence(rn)n∈Nsuch thatrn=kr−1wheneverkr−1≤n<kr. It holds that|μCn(B)−μC(B)|=|μCn(B)−μCn(Orn)+μCn(Orn)−μC(Orn)+μC(Orn)−μC(B)|≤|μCn(B)−μCn(Orn)|+|μCn(Orn)−μC(Orn)|+|μC(Orn)−μC(B)|,from which the desired assertion follows.□The condition of bounded densities that is required in the previous result is essential, as can be seen below.Example 3.2For everyn∈N,letJ1,2n=J2,2n={m2n:0≤m≤2n}. Consider an open cover O of∪nJ1,2nsuch that λ1(O) < 1/8. Let Λ be the set obtained as intersection of [0, 1]2 with all the lines with slope 1 passing through the points of type (x, 0) and(−x,0)with x ∈ O. It follows thatλ2(Λ)<2/4. Let αnbe the maximum of the distances between the setI2∖Λand every line with slope 1 passing through the points of type(b·m2n,0)withb∈{−1,1}and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2n.Now, letC=Π2. Let Cnbe the(J1,2n×J2,2n,(Cin)i∈In)-approximation of C, where everyCinis equal to the copula An, obtained as an ordinal sum of different copies of Π2 with respect to a partition ofIsuch that each of its intervals has length less than αn/4.Now, the density of Cnis strictly greater than 1/αnat least in some subsquare ofI2where Anconcentrates its probability mass (in fact, otherwise, the total probability mass of Cnwould be less than 1). Obviously, Cnconverges to Π2 pointwise. Moreover,μCn(Λ)=1for everyn∈N. However, since μC(Λ) < 1, Cndoes not converge strongly to C.Another kind of convergence that could be considered is the so-called convergence in total variation (see, e.g., Dudley, 1989). We say that a sequence of probability measures(μn)n∈Nconverges in total variation to μ if, and only if,supB∈B(Id)|μn(B)−μ(B)|tends to 0 asn→+∞. Obviously, convergence in total variation implies strong convergence. However, the opposite implication is not true. In fact, let μn,n∈N,and μ be absolutely continuous measures (with respect to λd) with densities fnand f, respectively, that are supported onId. It holdssupB∈B(Id)|μn(B)−μ(B)|=12∫Id|fn(u)−f(u)|dλd(u).Now, for everyn∈N,letJ1,2n=J2,2n={m2n:0≤m≤2n}. Let Cnbe the(J1,2n×J2,2n,(C(i,j)n)(i,j)∈{0,1,⋯,2n−1}2)-approximation of the copula Π2, where eachC(i,j)nis equal to ordinal sum of two copies of Π2 with respect to the partition given by [0, 1/2] and [1/2, 1]. Then, for everyn∈N,if fnis the density ofC(i,j)n,then|fn−1|=1a.e. onI2. Thus, Cndoes not converge to Π2 in total variation, but it converges strongly, as a consequence of Theorem 3.3.Now, let us consider another kind of convergence, known as D1-convergence in Fernández-Sánchez and Trutschnig (2014) and Trutschnig (2011) (but, here, denoted by δ1-convergence for notational purposes). Such a convergence is related to the Markov kernel representation of a copula (Trutschnig, 2011). As can be seen below, our approximation behaves well in such a case. Here, we recall that, for every copula A and a random vector (X, Y) distributed according to A, we denote (a version of) the regular conditional distribution of Y given X by KA( ·, ·), and we call it the Markov kernel of A. It follows that, for every Borel setF∈B(Id),one hasμA(F)=∫IKA(x,Fx)dλ(x),withFx={y∈Id−1:(x,y)∈F}.Theorem 3.4Let C be a copula. Let(Dn)n∈Nbe a sequence of meshes such that, for everyn∈N,Dn⊆Dn+1,and ‖Dn‖ → 0 asn→+∞. Let((Cin)i∈In)n∈Nbe a collection of sequences of copulas. Let Cn be the(Dn,(Cin)i∈In)-approximation of C. Then, asn→+∞,Cn converges to C in δ1-convergence.Let Knand K be the Markov kernels associated with Cnand C, respectively. In order to prove that Cn→ C in δ1-convergence it suffices to show that for almost everyx∈I,the (probability) measure Kn(x, ·) converges weakly to K(x, ·) asn→+∞(see Fernández-Sánchez & Trutschnig, 2014, Lemma 5).Since C is a copula, if(ai22,⋯,aidd)∈∏i=2dIi,rfor somer∈N(hereDr=∏i=1dIi,r), then the first derivative∂1C(x,ai22,⋯,aidd)exists for almost allx∈I. Since⋃n∈N∏i=2dIi,nis a countable union of finite sets of type∏i=2dIi,r,it follows that the set{x∈I:∂1C(x,ai22,⋯,aidd)existsforall(ai22,⋯,aidd)∈⋃n∈N∏i=2dIi,n}has Lebesgue measure equal to 1.Letx∈Isuch thatai1,n1<x<ai1+1,n1,i.e. x belongs to the interior of one interval of the partition I1, nassociated with the meshDn=∏i=1dIi,n. Let us denote by Hx, nand Hxthe distribution functions of the measures Kn(x, ·) and K(x, ·), respectively. Then we haveHx,n(ai22,⋯,aidd)=C(ai1+1,n1,ai22,⋯,aidd)−C(ai1,n1,ai22,⋯,aidd)ai1+1,n1−ai1,n1for every(ai22,⋯,aidd)∈⋃n∈N∏i=2dIi,n. It follows that, asn→+∞,Hx,n(ai22,⋯,aidd)→∂1C(x,ai22,⋯,aidd).Moreover, in view of Disintegration Theorem, for almost everyx∈Iit holdsHx(ai22,⋯,aidd)=∂1C(x,ai22,⋯,aidd)for every(ai22,⋯,aidd)∈⋃n∈N∏i=2dIi,n.Lety∈Id−1such that Hxis continuous in y. Then it holds that, asn→+∞,Hx, n(y) → Hx(y) wheny∈⋃n∈N∏i=2dIi,n.If, instead,y∉⋃n∈N∏i=2dIi,n,for eachn∈Nwe denote by y*, nthe smallest element in∏i=2dIi,nthat is greater or equal than y component-wise. Analogously, for eachn∈Nwe denote by y*, nthe largest element in∏i=2dIi,nthat is smaller or equal than y component-wise. From the monotonicity of distribution functions, it follows thatHx,n(y*,n)≤Hx,n(y)≤Hx,n(y*,n).Thus, by taking limits we haveHx(y*,n)≤liminfnHx,n(y)≤limsupnHx,n(y)≤Hx(y*,n).Moreover, because Hxis continuous in y,Hx(y*,n)≤liminfnHx,n(y)≤limsupnHx,n(y)≤Hx(y*,n),i.e. Hx, n(y) → Hx(y) asn→+∞.□As a general result about δ1-convergence (see, e.g., Fernández-Sánchez & Trutschnig, 2014), Theorem 3.4 also holds when we use the ∂-convergence considered by Mikusiński and Taylor (2010). As a byproduct, we obtain a known result: the checkerboard approximation of a copula C ∂-converges to C (see Li, Mikusiński, & Taylor, 1998; Mikusiński & Taylor, 2010).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have presented a method to extend a given subcopula to a copula with some constraints on the values that this extension assumes on specific segments ofId. This methodology has been hence used in some studies about the convergence of suitable approximations of a given copula (including checkerboard approximation).
