@&#ABSTRACT@&#
TrackGen is an online tool for the generation of tracks for two open-source 3D car racing games (TORCS and Speed Dreams). It integrates interactive evolution with procedural content generation and comprises two components: (i) a web frontend that maintains the database of all the evolved populations and manages the interaction with users (by collecting users evaluations and providing access to the evolved tracks) and (ii) an evolutionary/content-generation backend that runs both the evolutionary algorithm and generates the actual game content that is available through the web frontend. The first prototype of the tool was presented in July 2011 but advertised only to researchers; the first official version which generated tracks only for TORCS was released to the game community in September 2011; due to the many requests, we released a new version soon afterwards, in January 2012, with support for Speed Dreams (the fork of TORCS focused on visual realism and graphic quality) that has been online since then. From January 2012 until July 2014, TrackGen had more than 7600 unique visitors who visited the website around 11,500 times and viewed 85,500 pages; it was employed to evolve more than 8853 tracks, and it was used to download 12,218 tracks. Some of the tracks evolve by our system have been also included in the TORCS distribution.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Procedural Content Generation (PCG) dates back to the early 1980s when it was introduced to overcome the memory limitations of existing platforms and employed to distribute large amounts of pre-designed game content. After several decades, although the limitations that originated it have long gone, procedural content generation maintains its crucial role in the game industry as a mean to design, produce, and deliver huge amounts of game content, that would be unbearable for human designers (e.g., the infinite universes of Eve Online11http://www.eveonline.com/.). At the same time, procedural content generation has now become an advertised feature of commercial games as in the Borderlands franchise,22http://www.borderlandsthegame.com/ and http://www.borderlands2.com/.Spore,33http://www.spore.com/.Tiny Wings,44http://www.andreasilliger.com/.and many others [1].Search-Based Procedural Content Generation (SB-PCG) [2] is a branch of PCG that applies stochastic search algorithms to generate high-quality game content (e.g., levels, rules, weapons). In this paper, we present TrackGen, a tool that applies SB-PCG, more precisely interactive evolution, to the realm of car racing games, a popular genre in which the content plays a key role for the commercial success of the title (see for instance, Trackmania55http://www.trackmania.com.and rFactor66http://www.rfactor.net.).TrackGen is an online SB-PCG tool that evolves tracks for two open-source 3D car racing games (TORCS [3] and Speed Dreams [4]). TrackGen is inspired by the early work of Togelius et al. [5,6], who applied SB-PCG to a simple 2D game to evolve racing tracks which could fit a target player profile [5,6]. It is also inspired by our previous work on the automatic evolution of TORCS tracks [7] which could provide a large degree of diversity. Both [5–7] evaluate the quality of game content using several statistics collected during one or more races involving non-player characters. In contrast, TrackGen let users state what they consider interesting game content and employs an interactive genetic algorithm to search for the better tracks; in this respect, TrackGen has been strongly inspired by the work on Galactic Arms Race77http://gar.eecs.ucf.edu/.[8].TrackGen was first shown in its prototypical form during CIG-2011 and GECCO-2011, when a seminal paper about the tool was presented [9]. The first official version was released later in September 2011 to the TORCS community and received much feedback. In particular, we were asked to extend the tool to Speed Dreams [4], a fork of TORCS focused on visual realism and high-quality graphics. The second version that could produce tracks both for TORCS and Speed Dreams was released in January 2012 and has been online since then. The new version is also connected to a Twitter account (http://twitter.com/POLIMIVGR) and tweets an announcement every time new tracks are generated. Four tutorial videos available at the TrackGen website88TrackGen tutorial videos: http://trackgen.pierlucalanzi.net/about.htm; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFOa7L3oBwM; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_W4jHN2h2Q; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AzjMtRDnBo; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si_u_43HJnM.and YouTube demonstrate TrackGen main features and show examples of the high-quality tracks that the system is able to generate. So far, TrackGen had more than 7600 unique visitors who visited the website around 11,500 times and viewed 85,500 pages; it was employed to evolve more than 8853 tracks, and it was used to download 12,218 tracks. Some of the tracks evolve by our system have been also included in the TORCS distribution in an additional package of extra tracks.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We presented TrackGen, an online tool for the creation of tracks for TORCS and Speed Dreams, two very popular open-source 3D car racing games. TrackGen combines interactive evolution with procedural content generation to evolve tracks based on users’ preferences. Visitors can explore the available tracks, score them, and download tracks rendered using one of the five available scenarios (city, desert, hill, mountain and snow). To our knowledge, TrackGen is the first online collaborative tool for a game community to create content for their game using procedural content generation and interactive evolution. TrackGen has been online since January 2012 and by July 2014 it had 7600 unique visitors, received more than 12,218 download requests, and 85,500 pageviews in total. The analysis of the TrackGen traffic shows peaks corresponding to relevant activity in the TORCS community, which suggest that the tool is used also outside the research community. This was recently confirmed by a request we received from the maintainers of the TORCS project who asked us permission to include some of the tracks evolved by TrackGen in the next TORCS distribution.TrackGen cannot collect statistics about gameplay (e.g., how long a track was played by the users who downloaded it); unfortunately, these statistics could be available only if the tool was integrated with the official TORCS and Speed Dreams distribution, which represents a possible future direction for the TrackGen project. The system also does not track the number of users simultaneously connected since our current Internet provider does not provide such information (nor to the log of the DB server which is shared among several users). We estimate, given the information collected Google Analytics2525http://www.google.com/analytics/.and what we measured from the generation side, that no more than a couple of users are connected at once – which is coherent with the overall data. Thus we did not have issues of load testing or else. The system so far has been able to manage peaks with several hundreds downloads per day but its usage is still far below what might require some node balancing policy and thus a migration to a cloud solution.The framework underlying TrackGen is general and could be extended to any task where users’ opinions provide a better feedback than an ad-hoc fitness function. In this respect, we plan to extend the framework to the interactive evolution of crowds behavior (a fundamental aspects of many massive online games) whose quality is better evaluated by humans [39–41].
