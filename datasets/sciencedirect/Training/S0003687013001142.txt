@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
RULA was used to assess a child's postural risk during mobile ICT use.Participants were either occupational therapy students or experienced practitioners.No significant differences in RULA outcome scores between groups were found.No conclusive differences in visual search strategies between groups were found.RULA can be used to assess children's postural risk, regardless of experience.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) is an observation-based screening tool that has been used to assess postural risks of children in school settings. Studies using eye-tracking technology suggest that visual search strategies are influenced by experience in the task performed. This study investigated if experience in postural risk assessments contributed to differences in outcome scores on the RULA and the visual search strategies utilized. While wearing an eye-tracker, 16 student occupational therapists and 16 experienced occupational therapists used the RULA to assess 11 video scenarios of a child using different mobile information and communication technologies (ICT) in the home environment. No significant differences in RULA outcome scores, and no conclusive differences in visual search strategies between groups were found. RULA can be used as a screening tool for postural risks following a short training session regardless of the assessor's experience in postural risk assessments.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) by children has been associated with musculoskeletal discomfort (Burke and Peper, 2002; Harris and Straker, 2000; Jacobs and Baker, 2002; Ramos et al., 2005; Straker et al., 2009). This is concerning as children are still physically developing, and there might be negative long-term consequences on their physical health (Straker et al., 2009).There are no risk assessment tools specifically developed to assess postural risks in children. However, researchers have previously used the Ovako Working Posture Analysing System (OWAS) (Karhu et al., 1977) and the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993), both originally developed to assess adult workers, to assess postural risks among children in school settings. The use of RULA to assess children's posture has been reported more extensively in the scientific literature (Breen et al., 2007; Dockrell et al., 2010, 2012; Kelly et al., 2009; Laeser et al., 1998; Oates et al., 1998) than the OWAS (Saarni et al., 2007a, 2007b).The RULA is an observation-based screening tool used to quickly assess an individual's exposure to load factors due to posture, muscle function and forces they exert. Administration of the tool is simple to learn and does not require the use of special equipment or pre-existing skills in observation techniques (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993). The RULA involves assigning: 1) a numerical rating to the posture of the upper limbs, neck, trunk and legs, and 2) another numerical rating for additional factors that strain the musculoskeletal system, such as repetitive action, static loading and force exertion. These ratings are scored according to an algorithm to obtain a Grand Score ranging from 1 to 7, and an Action Level ranging from 1 to 4 that has associated implications for remedial action (Table 1). The RULA allows the left and right upper limbs to be assessed separately, yielding a Grand Score and Action Level for each side of the body.Prior ergonomics studies have used the RULA to assess the postures of children when performing academic tasks at computer workstations in school environments; in these studies the children's postures were influenced by the classroom furniture (Breen et al., 2007; Dockrell et al., 2010, 2012; Kelly et al., 2009; Laeser et al., 1998; Oates et al., 1998). No prior studies have used the RULA to perform postural risk assessments in home environments wherein children have high exposure to mobile ICT for leisure (Rideout et al., 2010), and use ICT for longer durations than when at school (Ciccarelli et al., 2011; Kent and Facer, 2004; Kerawalla and Crook, 2002).Due to the observational nature of risk assessments, visual search is an essential skill utilized by the assessor. Visual search depends primarily on eye behaviours of saccades and fixations (Falkmer et al., 2008; Liversedge and Findlay, 2000; Yang et al., 2002). Saccades are the voluntary rapid eye movements that direct the eye to points of interest in the environment; no visual information is projected on the fovea during this movement (Fuchs, 1971). Fixations are periods of gaze stability that occur between saccades (Duchowski, 2007). During fixations, the eye is directed such that information from the environment is projected onto the fovea, registered and processed (Fuchs, 1971).It is recognized that visual attention can be influenced by characteristics of the visual environment (bottom–up) and cognitive processes (top–down) (Henderson, 2003; Wolfe et al., 1989). Bottom–up factors that can affect visual attention include salient characteristics of the visual scene such as movement, contrast, and colour. On the other hand, top–down cognitive processes are related to short-term visual memory of the present scene, long-term memory about similar scenes and knowledge related to the visual search task (Henderson, 2003). During skilled, purposeful and active search, top–down cognitive processes tend to influence visual attention more than bottom–up processes (Henderson, 2003; Yang et al., 2002). The fixation point is assumed to reflect the focus of attention in a top–down approach (Henderson, 2003), and therefore is commonly used to provide an insight into the cognitive processes involved during visual search tasks (Falkmer et al., 2008).Previous studies have demonstrated that experience influences an individual's visual search strategy. In radiology, experts have significantly fewer numbers of fixations while making a greater number of correct judgements, and have a tendency to use a more global perception strategy (Kundel et al., 2007; Manning et al., 2006). In driving studies, experienced drivers have more flexible search strategies, indicated by larger spread of visual search on horizontal and vertical planes, shorter fixation durations and shorter hazard processing times (Hosking et al., 2010; Underwood, 2007; Underwood et al., 2002). Experienced gymnastics coaches displayed fewer numbers of fixations, but longer fixation durations, during evaluation of gymnastics routines (Moreno et al., 2002). Training in a systematic visual search strategy for a visual inspection task resulted in improved task performance (Wang et al., 1997). These studies showed that experience and training could make a difference in visual search strategies and the interpretation of information obtained from visual search (Yang et al., 2002). However, it is not known if this is the case in postural risk assessment scenarios.The aims of this study were to determine differences between experienced and novice assessors in their RULA scores (Grand Scores and Action Levels) and their visual search strategies during a postural risk assessment of a child using mobile ICT in the home environment.
