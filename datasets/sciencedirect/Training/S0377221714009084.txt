@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We consider the problem of pricing and alliance selection that a dominant retailer in a two-echelon supply chain decides when facing a potential upstream entry. The two-echelon supply chain consists of a dominant retailer, an incumbent supplier and an “incursive” vendor, where both the incumbent supplier and “incursive” vendor sell substitutable products to the common market through the dominant retailer. Our objective is to discuss whether the dominant retailer should sell the “incursive” vendor's products and, if so, how the dominant retailer strategically selects the alliance structure to maximize his/her own profit. We also present how all the members make their pricing decisions and analyze the impact of competitive intensity between two products on their pricing strategies after the entry of the vendor in possible alliance settings. Our results show that: (1) the introduction of the upstream vendor always benefits the retailer, and more interestingly, benefits the incumbent suppler in many cases, too; (2) in this paper, we define the competitive ability as the price dominance of one player over another when both are competing for the same customer market, if the price competition between the incumbent supplier and the “incursive” vendor is relatively fierce, the dominant retailer should ally with the one who has a relatively strong competitive ability rather than the other who has a relatively weak competitive ability; otherwise, he/she should ally with both upstream members. Finally, using numerical examples, we analyze the impact of different parameters and provide some management insights.In the supply chain management literature, the coordination issue has been extensively analyzed. Most of studies argued that the cooperation/coordination between all members of supply chain could make the pie bigger. Consequently, there emerge a lot of coordination mechanisms, such as quantity discounts (Monahan, 1984), credit option (Sarmah, Acharya, & Goyal, 2008), buy-back/return (Pasternack, 1985; Taylor, 2002) and revenue sharing (Cachon & Lariviere, 2005), etc. However, the above literature did not consider the effects of a possible incursion of a firm outside a supply chain on the profits or cost of the incumbent members in the supply chain. As we all know, the entry of new members or exit of existing members is very common in practice. For example, in the semiconductor industry, five big incumbent firms dominated almost half of the ASIC market in 1999, such as IBM (11 percent), Lucent (10.9 percent), NEC (10.5 percent), LSI Logic (9.3 percent) and Fujitsu (7.2 percent). However, with the evolvement of the industry, recently smaller firms are easy to reduce the barrier to entry of semiconductor industry via subcontract of manufacturing.11Refer to http://www.ukessays.com/essays/marketing/an-analysis-of-the-semiconductor-industry-marketing-essay.php.Hence, it is common that one buyer in semiconductor industry purchases products from either incumbent suppliers (e.g., IBM, NEC) or entrant suppliers (e.g. Samsung, Toshiba) (refer to Cho, Kim, & Rhee, 1998). This gives rise to several interesting discussions: (i) with the entry of a new incursive member, how should the incumbent members in the supply chain adjust their operations? (ii) For the dominant retailer, should he/she choose to cooperate with the incumbent supplier or/and the new invader? For the incumbent supplier, whether does he/she compete against or cooperate with the new invader? To best of our knowledge, the existing related literature has not addressed these questions. The goal of this paper is to cover this gap.Literature on supply chain management is very plentiful. Researchers (such as Corbett, Zhou, & Tang, 2004; Ertek & Griffin, 2002; Leng & Parlar, 2005, etc.) have presented excellent surveys for the literature in the field of supply chain management. Among these researches, most of them discussed two-echelon supply chain, where a manufacturer/supplier wholesales a product to a retailer/buyer who then retails it to the end consumers. Moreover, in many researches, the supplier is usually assumed to be a dominator, i.e., the supplier implements the “supplier-Stackelberg” ([sS]) game (Arcelus & Srinivasan, 1987; Wang, 2002; Zhou, Min, & Goyal, 2008). In reality, however, the upstream supplier is not always more powerful than its downstream retailer. Sometimes it happens that the upstream and downstream players have nearly equal power, such as Intel and IBM/Compaq, but the downstream retailer may be a dominator, such as Wal-Mart. Therefore, there also exists some literature on supply chain management, which employed the vertical Nash game (Chu & Messinger, 1997; Hisashi, Yao, & Liu, 2007) or a “retailer-Stackelberg” ([rS]) game (Choi, 1991; Lau, Lau, & Wang, 2007; Tsay, 2002; Wang, Lau, & Lau, 2009). However, all these researches assumed that the number of firms in a supply chain is given as well, i.e., they ignored the effect of potential entry on supply chain management. In this paper, the important differences are that in a [rS] game, we analyze the pricing and alliance selection issues of a two-echelon supply chain by considering the entry of new upstream firms. Hence, in what follows, we mainly review the literature that is directly related to the entry issue on supply chain management.The literature on the entry issue can be classified as two categories: single-echelon and two-echelon. In single-echelon model, most of studies considered such a situation that a single monopolized incumbent already occupies one market while a new entrant is planning to enter the same market. From the incumbent's perspective, lots of strategies were presented, such as pricing (Arbatskaya, 2001; Hauser & Wernerfelt, 1988), advertising (Ishigaki, 2000; Schmalensee, 1983), investing on R&D of new technologies (Lukach, Kort, & Plasmans, 2007), and using location as a signal of cost (Boyer, Mahenc, & Moreaux, 2003). There also has some literature on the entry issue from other perspective in single echelon setting. For example, Seade (1980) studied the effect of entry on the profits of incumbent firms and the performance of supply chain. Aoyagi (1996) established a long-run multi-period model where an incumbent firm may change ownership in each period and discussed the role of changing ownership of a long-run firm facing a sequence of potential entrants to its market. Arping and Diaw (2008) studied the effect of sunk cost on an incumbent firm who has the possibility of liquidating assets and exiting the market. Additionally, a few papers consider the case there are multiple incumbents. For instance, Bagwell and Ramey (1991) considered pricing strategy among multiple incumbents with the entry of new firm. Ashiya (2000) studied the optimization problem of an incumbent firm who faces two entrants: a weak one and a strong one.For the two-echelon models, there are only a few literatures about the entry issue. Tyagi (1999) considered a two-echelon supply chain where n incumbent retailers buy a product from an incumbent supplier and then sell the product to consumers. His paper mainly analyzed the effect of entry in a retailing market on pricing and profits of incumbent firms. Schultz (1999) studied a vertical structure including an incumbent supplier, an incumbent retailer and a potential entry retailer; Xiao and Qi (2010) developed a model of considering how an incumbent supplier to deter the entry of a potential supplier under uncertain demand. They showed that the supply chain structure may affect the deterrence strategy of the incumbent supplier. Liu and Zhang (2006) discussed that whether an incumbent retailer has an incentive to deter the supplier from selling in the consuming market when an incumbent supplier may potentially enter the retailing market. This paper considered a two-echelon supply chain consisting of an incumbent supplier, a potential “incursive” vendor and an incumbent dominant retailer. The incumbent supplier and “incursive” vendor sell the substitutable products to consumers through the common retailer. Different from their researches, in this paper we mainly discuss whether the dominant retailer should sell the “incursive” product, and how the retailer utilizes the upstream entry to strategically select the alliance structure so that he/she can get as more benefits as possible. Note that our paper is also different from some existing literatures related to channel selection, such as Cai, Zhang, and Zhang (2009), Cai (2010), etc., where they studied whether the supplier benefits from adding a new direct channel to the traditional single-channel supply chain.In this paper, we consider a two-echelon supply chain, where an incumbent supplier sells products through an incumbent dominant retailer. Suppose an “incursive” vendor also hopes to sell his/her products through the same retailer in the same market. The products of both the supplier and the vendor are substitutable. We answer whether or not the retailer should agree to sell the “incursive” vendor's product. We also discuss the effect of the “incursive” vendor's entry on the pricing schemes and profits of the incumbent retailer and supplier. Furthermore, we discuss the alliance selection issue of the dominant retailer. That is, when the “incursive” vendor is entering into the market, whether the retailer should choose to ally with the incumbent supplier or “incursive” vendor? If so, with whom does the retailer prefer to ally?The main contributions of this paper include the following three aspects. First, we discuss pricing issues in a two-echelon supply chain with the upstream entry, whereas most of the existing two-echelon models analyzed pricing issues in the setting of the downstream entry. Second, under each of possible alliance settings, we study whether the dominant retailer should sell the “incursive” vendor's product. Our analytical results show that the retailer as the dominant in supply chain has incentives to sell the “incursive” vendor's product under any possible alliance setting. Furthermore, not only the dominant retailer always prefers much fiercer price competition between the incumbent supplier and the “incursive” vendor, but also the incumbent supplier prefers to compete more fiercely against the “incursive” vendor in many cases. The former is consistent with our intuition but the latter seems opposite to our expectation. Third, most of researches on the entry issue focus on how the incumbent firm deters the potential entrant to enter the market, whereas we discuss how the incumbent dominant retailer selects the alliance structure to maximize his/her profit by means of the upstream entry. Our analytical results show that when facing the “incursive” vendor's entry into the upstream wholesale market, the best option for the dominant retailer is to ally with one or both of the incumbent supplier and the “incursive” vendor. Specifically, if the price competition between the incumbent supplier and the “incursive” vendor is relatively fierce, the dominant retailer should ally with the one who has a relatively strong competitive ability22In this paper, we define the competitive ability as the price dominance of one player over another when both are competing for the same customer market.rather than the other who has a relatively weak competitive ability; otherwise, he/she should ally with both upstream members. This exactly explains why sometimes retailers, like Wal-Mart and Carrefour, ally with store brand suppliers but compete against national brand suppliers.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The problem formulation is presented in Section 2. Given the dominant retailer is willing to sell the “incursive” vendor's product, Section 3 discusses the pricing strategies of the members in two-echelon supply chain and the impact of competition on their pricing strategies under various alliance settings. Then, Section 3 further analyzes whether the dominant retailer is willing to sell the “incursive” vendor's product under different alliance structures. The optimal alliance option strategy for the dominant retailer is discussed in Section 4. Numerical examples are given in Section 5 to illustrate the models. Conclusions are included in Section 6.In this paper, we consider a two-echelon supply chain with an incumbent supplier (hereafter “Supp”) and an incumbent dominant retailer (hereafter “Reta”). On the one hand, Reta purchases product (hereafter “e”) from “Supp”, on the other hand, there is an “incursive” vendor (hereafter “Vend”) outside of supply chain from whom Reta also can purchase substitutable product (hereafter “i”). The end demand for products is sensitive to the selling price.Let pkand Dkdenote the retail price and demand of product k (k = e, i), respectively. We normalize the total customer market size to 1 and consider the linearly price-sensitive demand functions, which are given as follows:1.If Reta sells product e only, then De= 1 − peand Di= 0.If Reta sells product e and product i simultaneously, thenDe=1−pe+γ(pi−pe)andDi=1−pi+γ(pe−pi),where γ represents the degree that the demand moves from one product to the other, incurred by the difference between retail prices. In this paper, γ can be explained as the competitive intensity of the two products in the retail price side. Obviously, the total demand is independent of γ since De+ Di= 2 − pe− pi. The above linear demand functions are worth highlighting. First, it is tractable and easy to derive closed-form solutions with these linear demand functions (Dixit, 1979; Milgrom & Roberts, 1990). Second, the linear demand function has been widely used in the price competition literature (e.g., Amrouche & Yan, 2012; Anderson & Bao, 2010; Cai et al., 2009; Kurata, Yao, & Liu, 2007; McGuire & Staelin, 1983; Xiao & Qi, 2010, etc.).Furthermore, we assume these two products have the same unit cost of raw material, which is denoted by c. The unit operating cost of product k (k = e, i) is denoted by ck. Hence, the unit total cost of product k can be calculated as c + ck. For convenience, we set c = 0 due to the fact that parameter c does not influence the decision making of all members. Reta purchases product k from upstream Supp or Vend at the wholesale price wk.Now the question is, when Vend attempts to sell product i to consumers through Reta, whether should Reta accept Vend’s request? If Reta does so, how do these three parties (Reta, Supp and Vend) design their own price, respectively? To answer these questions, we need the following assumptions first.Assumption 1Supp and Vend do not form an alliance because they sell substitutable products. They have equal power and play a horizontal Nash game.All members in the supply chain share their individual information, such as cost, customer demand, selling price, etc.33This assumption is very prevailing in most of literature on supply chain coordination and competition, such as McGuire and Staelin (1983), Kurata et.al. (2007), Cai et al. (2009), Anderson and Bao (2010), Amrouche and Yan (2012), etc. In practice, members in a supply chain may not share their private information with each other. However, the research on the case of asymmetric information between parties exceeds the purpose of this paper, and it will be left over for our further research.Reta will accept Vend’s product i as long as Vend’s entry does not lower his/her own profit. Supp will exit the customer market once he/she cannot get a positive profit from the business. In other words, product e will not exit the market as long as De> 0. Likewise, Vend will enter the market only when his/her profit is greater than zero, i.e., product i enters the market as long as Di> 0. (This assumption is valid based on the fact wholesale price is never less than the sum of raw material cost and operational cost.)It is easy to know that the answers for the above questions depend on whether Reta allies with Vend or/and Supp. Therefore, we will consider four possible alliance settings: (i) No alliance; (ii) RV alliance (Reta-Vend Alliance); (iii) RS alliance (Reta-Supp Alliance); (iv) RSV alliance (Reta-Supp-Vend Alliance).(i)No allianceIn this setting, Reta and Supp make their decisions separately before Vend enters the market. After Vend enters the market, all of these three players still set their individual price to maximize their own profits, respectively. Under this setting, Reta plays the [rS] game with Supp and Vend, while Supp and Vend play the horizontal Nash game.RV allianceThis setting goes as below. Both Reta and Supp set their prices independently before Vend enters the market. After Vend enters the market, Reta and Vend form an alliance. Then, RV alliance plays an “alliance-Stackelberg” game with Supp.RS allianceBefore Vend enters the wholesale market, Reta and Supp make their decisions in pricing separately. After Vend enters the market, Reta and Supp decide to form an alliance. This alliance plays an “alliance-Stackelberg’’ game with Vend.RSV allianceAt the very beginning, Reta and Supp make their pricing decisions separately. After Vend enters the market, these three members are willing to form an alliance.Worthy of mentioning is that in the above four alliances, we assume that Reta does not form an alliance with Supp before product i is introduced. Its main objective is to conveniently investigate how the dominator Reta maximizes his own profit when facing the entry of Vend. In practice, however, it is possible for Reta and Supp to form an alliance before Vend enters the market. If Reta and Supp have formed an alliance before Vend enters the wholesale market, the situations of “No alliance” and “RV alliance” will not happen in this section. This case will be further discussed in Appendix A.In order to highlight the effect of entry of new firm, in subsequent discussion, we take the case of Reta selling product e only as a benchmark (hereafter “Benchmark”). Let subscript R denote retailer, S supplier, V vendor and A alliance, respectively. Subscript e represents product e, and subscript i denotes product i. Superscripts B, N, RS, RV and RSV represent Benchmark, No alliance, RS alliance, RV alliance and RSV alliance, respectively. Besides, we need the following notations:ΠXYthe profit for X in Y setting;the retail price for product k in Y setting;the wholesale price for product k in Y setting;the demand for product k in Y setting.where k = e or i; X = R, S, V or A; Y = B, N, RS, RV or RSV.In this section, we consider Reta only purchases product e from Supp and sells it to the customer. Then the profits of Reta and Supp can be formulated as followings(1)ΠR=(1−pe)(pe−we)andΠS=(1−pe)(we−ce).Since Reta is dominator in the supply chain, in this case Reta plays the [rS] game with Supp. Reta would first declare his/her required unit marginal revenue as ue, then Supp decides his/her optimal wholesale price weafter knowing Reta’s retail price pe= we+ ue. Using the standard backward induction method, form (1) we easily get Supp’s optimal wholesale priceweB, Reta's optimal retail pricepeB, Supp’s profit ΠSBand Reta’s profit ΠRBas followings. (The derivation process is omitted.)(2){weB=(1+3ce)/4,peB=(3+ce)/4,ΠSB=(1−ce)2/16,ΠRB=(1−ce)2/8.We further consider the case where Reta sells product e and product i in his/her customer market simultaneously. Then, Supp, Vend and Reta’s profits can be modeled as followings:(3){ΠS=[1−(1+γ)pe+γpi](we−ce),ΠV=[1−(1+γ)pi+γpe](wi−ci),ΠR=[1−(1+γ)pe+γpi](pe−we)ΠR=+[1−(1+γ)pi+γpe](pi−wi).To avoid trivial problems, we assume that the demands for these two products are always greater than 0 if the retail prices of these two products are replaced by their respective per-unit costs, i.e.,(4){1−(1+γ)pe+γpi=(1−ce)−γ(ce−ci)>0,1−(1+γ)pi+γpe=(1−ci)−γ(ci−ce)>0.Where we assume ceand ciare less than 1. Let Ω  ≡  (1 − ci)/(1 − ce), which represents the relative competitive ability that the price dominance of product i over product e when both are competing for the same customer market. If Ω > 1, it implies that product i has competitive advantages over product e in cost. If Ω < 1, the opposite is true. From (4), we have γ/(1 + γ) < Ω < (1 + γ)/γ, which is equivalent to the following inequality(5)0≤γ<max{Ω/(1−Ω),1/(Ω−1)}≡γU.Especially, when Ω = 1, the upper bound of γ converges to positive infinity. Eq. (5) shows competitive intensity in sales price is limited to a suitable range. Beyond this range, the problems we consider in this paper will become trivial. For example, if γ ≥ γU, Supp will exit the market as Ω > 1, while Vend will not enter the market as Ω < 1. Therefore, we assume that γ always satisfies the inequality of (5) in the subsequent analysis.In this section, we first discuss the Reta, Supp and Vend’s optimal pricing, and the impact of competitive ability on the optimal decisions and the players’ performance under each of the above four alliance settings, assuming that Reta agree to sell Vend’s product i in each alliance setting. Then, we further analyze whether or not Reta can get benefits by selling Vend’s product i in each alliance setting.As known in Section 2, Supp and Vend play the [rS] game with Reta independently in this setting. Therefore, Reta will first declare his/her marginal revenue of ueand uiby selling product e and i respectively, then Supp and Vend decide the corresponding wholesale price weand wiafter observing Reta’s requirements. Using the backward induction method, we can obtain the Supp, Vend and Reta’s optimal pricing decisions as followings:(6){weN=ce+(1−ce)[(2+4γ+γ2)−γ(1+γ)Ω]/[2(4+8γ+3γ2)],wiN=ci+(1−ce)[(2+4γ+γ2)Ω−γ(1+γ)]/[2(4+8γ+3γ2)],peN=ce+(1−ce)[2(3+6γ+2γ2)−γ(1+γ)Ω]/[2(4+8γ+3γ2)],piN=ci+(1−ce)[2(3+6γ+2γ2)Ω−γ(1+γ)]/[2(4+8γ+3γ2)].Appendix B gives out the derivation details of Eq. (6). Furthermore, based on the optimal prices in Eq. (6), we can have the selling demands of two products and the corresponding profits of the three players:(7){DeN=(1−ce)(1+γ)[(2+4γ+γ2)−γ(1+γ)Ω]/[2(4+8γ+3γ2)],DiN=(1−ce)(1+γ)[(2+4γ+γ2)Ω−γ(1+γ)]/[2(4+8γ+3γ2)],ΠSN=(1−ce)2(1+γ){[(2+4γ+γ2)−γ(1+γ)Ω]2/[2(4+8γ+3γ2)]}2,ΠVN=(1−ce)2(1+γ){[(2+4γ+γ2)Ω−γ(1+γ)]2/[2(4+8γ+3γ2)]}2,ΠRN=(1−ce)2(1+γ)[(2+4γ+γ2)−2γ(1+γ)ΩΠRN=+(2+4γ+γ2)Ω2]/[4(4+8γ+3γ2)].Since γ < γU, from (7) it is easy to knowDeN>0,DiN>0and obtain Corollary 1.Corollary 1FromEq. (7), we have the following results:(a)∂weN/∂γ<0,∂wiN/∂γ<0,∂peN/∂γ<0,and∂piN/∂γ<0.∂ΠRN/∂γ>0.If Ω ≥ 1,∂ΠSN/∂γ<0; if Ω < 0.7029,∂ΠSN/∂γ>0; if 0.7029 < Ω < 1,∂ΠSN/∂γ>0for 0 ≤ γ < γS1but∂ΠSN/∂γ<0for γS1 ≤ γ <  γU, where γS1is the unique root over (0, γU) to the following equation: 3γ4 + 12γ3 + 24γ2 + 26γ + 8 = (3γ4 + 15γ3 + 29γ2 + 25γ + 8)Ω.If Ω ≤ 1,∂ΠVN/∂γ<0; if Ω > 1.4227,∂ΠVN/∂γ>0; if 1 < Ω < 1.4227,∂ΠVN/∂γ>0for 0 ≤ γ < γV but∂ΠVN/∂γ<0for γV≤ γ < γU, where γV is the unique root to the following equation: (3γ4 + 12γ3 + 26γ2 + 24γ + 8)Ω = 3γ4 + 21γ3 + 38γ2 + 28γ + 8.Corollary 1 reveals how the price competitive intensity of γ influences three members' pricing strategies and corresponding profits in the No alliance setting. Corollary 1(a) shows that if Reta sells Supp and Vend’s product i simultaneously in the No alliance setting, both the wholesale prices and the retail prices of two products will decrease as the price competitive intensity of γ increases. This means that the entry of Vend’s product will lead to the price competition between two products, which forces Supp and Vend to reduce their wholesale prices. This, in turn, enables Reta decrease his/her retail price, which reduces the double marginalization. Moreover, the fiercer the price competition, the more effectively the double marginalization will be ameliorated. From Corollary 1(b), we know that the Reta’s profit always increases as γ increases. This is because the alleviation of the double marginalization can increases consumer surplus to expand total demand of two products. Therefore, from Corollary 1(b) we get that the competition between two upstream suppliers (i.e. Supp and Vend) will always benefits the downstream retailer.From (c) and (d) of Corollary 1, we have the following interesting insights: If two suppliers (i.e., Supp and Vend) have the same competitive ability (i.e., Ω = 1), the price competition between them will promote a “lose-lose” outcome. This is consistent with our intuition. However, if the two suppliers have different competitive abilities (i.e., Ω ≠ 1), fierce competition is always beneficial to the one who has an absolute advantage in the competitive ability but detrimental to the other with an absolute disadvantage in the competitive ability. In additional, when the competitive intensity is relatively small, the superior will prefer much fiercer competition even if the competitive ability of one supplier is slightly superior to that of the other.In what follows, we further analyze whether Reta should sell Vend’s product i in the No alliance setting. The results are shown in Proposition 1.Proposition 1In the No alliance setting, (a) it is always beneficial for Reta to introduce Vend's product i; (b) Reta selling product i is harmful to Supp if Ω ≥ 1 but beneficial to Supp if Ω < 0.767, and if 0.767 ≤ Ω < 1, the introduction of Vend's product i is beneficial to Supp as γ<γS2 but harmful to Supp as γ≥γS2, where γS2 is the unique root of the following equation over the interval (0, γU): 2√(1 + γ)[γ2 + 4γ + 2 − (1 + γ)γΩ] = 3γ2 + 8γ + 4.Proposition 1 demonstrates that Reta is always willing to introduce Vend’s product i in the No alliance setting. This is because introducing product i not only forces Supp to reduce the wholesale price of product e, which in turn motivates Reta to lower his/her the retail price of product e to enhance the demand of product e, but also brings Reta additional profits from selling product i. Another consequence of Proposition 1 is that in the No alliance setting, if Supp has an absolute advantage over Vend in the competitive ability, the entry of Vend’s product i will be always beneficial to Supp; even if Supp has only a slight advantage over Vend in the competitive ability, the introduction of Vend’s product i is also beneficial to Supp under relatively small competition intensities. It implies that in the upstream market, Supp who has strong competitive ability should encourage the invasion of his/her rivals rather than deter their entries. This insight seems opposite to the practice and that obtained in most of the existing literature on the entry issue. As for why incumbent suppliers rarely encourage the entrance of new rivals in the existing literature as well as in practice, possible reasons are the following. In the existing literature, most of the literature ignored the impact of the difference between incumbent member and new entrant in competitive ability. They either discussed the competitive pricing issues between incumbent member and new one, or studied how to design the deterrence policies of incumbent members under an implicit assumption of the same competitive ability. Whereas in practice, our common sense is that a new entry to the wholesale market has a negative impact on the incumbent supplier because of the direct competition. Therefore, facing the potential entrant, the incumbent suppliers usually find different deterrence mechanisms to deter entry.The above insight is a supplement to the existing literature and our intuition. Actually, an incumbent supplier is also likely to have incentives to allow the entry of his/her weaker rivals in practice. For example, the incumbent supplier may put much more efforts on the development of new technology or products if allowing the entry of these rivals. Especially when the incumbent supplier has advantages in technology, he/she can obtain benefits from providing his/her rivals with technical support. This supports our insight to some extent.In this setting, Reta will ally with Vend, and then play an “alliance-Stackelberg” game with Supp. That is, the alliance first declares the retail price piof product i and the required markup ueof product e, Supp then decides the wholesale price we. Similarly, following the backward induction, we can get RV alliance and Supp's optimal pricing policies in the RV alliance setting as follows:(8){weRV=ce+(1−ce)(1+γ−γΩ)/[4(1+γ)],peRV=ce+(1−ce)(3+3γ−γΩ)/[4(1+γ)],piRV=(1+ci)/2.The derivation details of Eq. (8) are given in Appendix B. Furthermore, the above optimal prices will yield the corresponding selling demand of the two products, and RV alliance and Supp's profits,(9){DeRV=(1−ce)(1+γ−γΩ)/4,DiRV=(1−ce)[(2+4γ+γ2)Ω−γ(1+γ)]/[4(1+γ)],ΠSRV=(1−ce)2(1+γ−γΩ)2/[16(1+γ)],ΠARV=(1−ce)2[(2+4γ+γ2)Ω2−2γ(1+γ)ΩΠARV=+(1+γ)2]/[8(1+γ)].From Eq. (9), we easily have DeRV>0, DiRV>0 and Corollary 2.Corollary 2FromEq. (9), we have the following results:(a)∂weRV/∂γ<0,∂peRV/∂γ<0and∂piRV/∂γ=0;∂ΠARV/∂γ>0;If Ω ≥ 1, then∂ΠSRV/∂γ<0; otherwise∂ΠSRV/∂γ>0as γ > (2Ω − 1)/(1 − Ω), but∂ΠSRV/∂γ<0as γ < (2Ω − 1)/(1 − Ω).Corollary 2 reveals the impact of the price competitive intensity of γ on three members' pricing strategies and corresponding profits in the RV alliance setting. From Corollary 2, we can get the following insights: (i) Corollary 2(a) shows that as the intensity of price competition γ increases, along supply chain product e’s wholesale price and retail price will decrease, while product i’s retail price picharged by RV alliance remains unchanged. In additional, Corollary 2(b) shows that the profit of RV alliance increases with the intensity of price competition γ. It implies that the introduction of product i in the RV alliance setting will mitigate the double marginalization. Hence, the fiercer the competition is, the more the RV alliance gains; (ii) From (c) of Corollary 2, we get when Supp has no advantage over Vend in the competitive ability (i.e. Ω > 1), Supp’s profit will decrease as γ increases. If Supp has an advantage of competitive ability over Vend (i.e. Ω < 1), Supp’s profit first decreases and then increases as γ increases. It implies that in the RV alliance setting, Supp prefers to compete against his/her rival Vend in some cases, and sometimes even prefers much fiercer competition with Vend. This is because when the competitive intensity γ exceeds (2Ω − 1)/(1 − Ω),piRVbecomes greater thanpeRV, which demonstrates that Supp has more power in price competition in this case. Therefore, it is easy know that the demand for Supp’s product will increase with the competitive intensity.Next, Proposition 2 will analyze whether Reta should ally with Vend to sell Vend’s product i.Proposition 2(a) It is always beneficial for Reta to form an alliance with Vend to introduce product i; (b) In the RV alliance setting, the entry of Vend's product i is detrimental to Supp if Ω(√5 − 1)/2, otherwise the introduction of product i is harmful to Supp as γ ≤ (2Ω − 1)/(1 − Ω)2, while beneficial to Supp as γ > (2Ω − 1)/(1 − Ω)2.Proposition 2(a) indicates that, in the RV alliance setting, Reta has always incentives to accept Vend’s product i. This result makes sense. In additional, from Proposition 2(b), we obtain that Supp also prefers product i to be introduced if the intensity of price competition is sufficiently big and Supp has a strong comparative advantage over Vend in the competitive ability. It implies that even in the RV setting the entry of Vend is also beneficial to Supp in many cases. This observation seems inconsistent with our expectation. Possible explanation is that when the price competition between upstream suppliers (i.e. Supp and Vend) is relatively fierce, the introduction of Vend’s product i will increase the demand of Supp’s product e. Consequently, Supp’s increased profit from the demand's increase can cover the loss due to the decrease of wholesale price.In this setting, Reta and Supp first form an alliance and then play the alliance-Stackelberg game with Vend. As the Stackelberg leader, the alliance declares the retail price peof product e and the required marginal revenue uiof product i. Vend then determines his/her wholesale price wito maximize his/her profit. Using the backward induction method, the RS alliance and Vend’s optimal pricing strategies in the RS alliance setting are given as follows:(10){wiRS=ci+(1−ce)[(1+γ)Ω−γ]/[4(1+γ)],piRS=ci+(1−ce)[3(1+γ)Ω−γ]/[4(1+γ)],peRS=(1+ce)/2.The derivation details of Eq. (10) are given in Appendix B. Substituting the above optimal prices into demand functions of two products and the profit functions of RS alliance and Vend, respectively, we have the followings(11){DiRS=(1−ce)[(1+γ)Ω−γ]/4,DeRS=(1−ce)[(2+4γ+γ2)−γ(1+γ)Ω]/[4(1+γ)],ΠVRS=(1−ce)2[(1+γ)Ω−γ]2/(4(1+γ)),ΠARS=(1−ce)2[(2+4γ+γ2)−2γ(1+γ)ΩΠARS=+(1+γ)2Ω2]/[8(1+γ)].Similarly, from Eqs. (10) and (11), it is easy to haveDeRS>0,DiRS>0and Corollary 3 since γ < γU.Corollary 3FromEqs. (10)and (11), we have the following results:(a)∂wiRS/dγ<0,∂piRS/∂γ<0and∂peRS/∂γ=0.∂ΠARS/∂γ>0.If Ω ≤ 1, then∂ΠVRS/∂γ<0; otherwise∂ΠVRS/∂γ>0as γ > (2 − Ω)/(Ω − 1), while∂ΠVRS/∂γ<0as γ < (2 − Ω)/(Ω − 1).Corollary 3 shows the impact of the price competitive intensity of γ on three members’ pricing strategies and corresponding profits in the RS alliance setting. From Corollary 3, the following conclusions can be obtained: (i) Corollary 3(a) indicates that as the intensity of price competition γ increases, both the wholesale price and the retail price for product i decrease, while the retail price pecharged by the RS alliance remains unchangeable. It means that after the introduction of Vend’s product i in the RS alliance setting, the price competition between Supp and Vend will lessen the double marginalization; (ii) Corollary 3(b) demonstrates that the profit of RS alliance increases as γ increases. This implies that the fiercer the competition is, the more the RS alliance gains; (iii) fromCorollary 3(c), similarly we know that, in the RS alliance setting, when Vend has no advantage over Supp in the competitive ability, Vend’s profit decreases as γ increases. If Vend has an advantage over Supp in the competitive ability, Vend’s profit first decreases and then increases as γ increases. It implies that, in the RS alliance setting, Vend who has an advantage in the competitive ability may also prefer much fiercer competition with Supp, which seems to be out of our expectation. An explanation for this observation is that when the competitive intensity γ exceeds a threshold value (say, (2 − Ω)/(Ω − 1)), a larger γ yields a higher the demand DiRSof product i, which gives Vend’s benefits more than the loss incurred by the decrease of the wholesale price.Then, whether is the RS alliance willing to introduce Vend’s product i while Vend wants to enter the market? Proposition 3 shows the answer.Proposition 3It is always beneficial for the RS alliance to introduce Vend's product i.Proposition 3 indicates that if Reta forms a RS alliance with Supp, allowing Vend to enter the market is always beneficial to both Reta and Supp. Therefore, both Reta and Supp have incentives to introduce product i in the RS alliance setting.In this setting, after Vend enters the market, Reta will ally with both Supp and Vend. Then, the three members will make their pricing decisions jointly. It is easy to derive that the optimal selling prices and profit for the RSV alliance, which are given respectively by(12){piRSV=(1+ci)/2,peRSV=(1+ce)/2,DiRSV=(1−ce)[(1+γ)Ω−γ]/2,DeRSV=(1−ce)[(1+γ)−γΩ]/2,ΠARSV=(1−ce)2[1+Ω2+γ(1−Ω)2]/4.The derivation details of Eq. (12) are given in Appendix B.From (12), we can easily observe the followings. (i) In the RSV alliance setting, changing the intensity of price competition γ does not affect the retail prices of two products; (ii) The profit of the RSV alliance increases with γ as long as Supp and Vend have the difference in the competitive ability (i.e., Ω ≠ 1). This is because that the larger the intensity of price competition γ, the more the demand transferred from the high cost (i.e., low Ω) product to the low cost (i.e., high Ω) product will be. Since the markup charged for the low cost product is higher than that for the high cost product, the profit of the RSV alliance increases as γ increases. An insight from this observation is that a company can improve its performance by consciously introducing substitutable products and keeping price competition between these products. This just explains why in practice many firms usually manufacture different models of products, such as different models of cars, cameras, refrigerators, etc.Proposition 4The introduction of Vend's product i is always profitable to both Reta and Supp in the RSV alliance setting.Proposition 4 shows that if both Reta and Supp are willing to ally with Vend while Vend is entering the market, the introduction of product i always benefits Reta and Supp. Therefore, Reta has incentives to sell Vend’s product i in the RSV alliance setting.In this section, we will compare the price decisions under different settings. From Eqs. (2), (6), (8), (10) and (12), we can get the following proposition:Proposition 5(a)weB>weN>weRVandwiN>wiRS;peB−weB=peN−weN=peRV−weRVandpiN−wiN=piRS−wiRS;peB>peN>peRV>peRS=peRSVandpiN>piRS>piRV=piRSV.From Proposition 5, we can get the following observations: (i) Introducing product i can force Supp to reduce the wholesale price of product e. Moreover, if Reta further allys with one of Supp and Vend, the other of Supp and Vend can be compelled to decrease the wholesale price further. (ii) Among the four alliances discussed, the retail prices of both products are the highest under the “No alliance” setting but the lowest under the “RSV alliance” setting. It indicates that the formation of the vertical alliance leads to the decrease of retail price. That is, it weakens the double marginalization, which is consistent with our intuition. (iii) Introducing product i may make Reta to reduce the sales price of Supp’s product e, which may generate more consumer surplus. Moreover, if Reta further allys with one of Supp and Vend, Reta may further decrease the sales prices of both Supp’s and Vend’s product. This is mainly because the vertical alliance can mitigate the double marginalization and the products of Supp and Vend are mutually substitutable. (iv) The introduction of Vend’s product i does not change the Reta’s markup for product e. Likewise, whether Reta forms an alliance with Supp (or Vend) does not influence the Reta’s markup of product i (or e), too.Similarly, from Eqs. (3), (7), (9), (11) and (12), we have the following proposition:Proposition 6(a)ΠSN>ΠSRVandΠVN>ΠVRS;ΠARS>ΠRN+ΠSNandΠARV>ΠRN+ΠVN;ΠARSV>ΠRN+ΠSN+ΠVN,ΠARSV>ΠARV+ΠSRVandΠARSV>ΠARS+ΠVRS.From (a) of Proposition 6, we can easily infer that as the follower, if Supp (Vend) does not ally with Reta, Vend (Supp) allying with Reta will lead to the decrease of Supp’s (Vend’s) profit. Hence, if one of Supp and Vend does not ally with Reta, he/she does not hope that his/her rival allies with Reta, too. From (b) and (c) of Proposition 6, we can observe that as the leader, Reta has always incentives to ally with one or both of two followers.In this section, we consider the selection decision of with whom, Supp or Vend, or both of them, the dominant or Reta, should ally.Assumption 4Reta, Supp and Vend are willing to form an alliance as long as each member in the alliance can obtain more profit than without the alliance.Thus, if an alliance leads to an increase of the sum of all members’ profits in the alliance, the members in this alliance might be willing to cooperate with each other, because each member in the will obtain more benefits as long as they can negotiate a splitting fraction of the increased profit of the whole alliance. We call this simple mechanism ‘increased-profit sharing’. For example, Reta and Supp (Vend) will be willing to form “RS (RV) alliance” if they can negotiate a splitting fraction of the increased profit for the “RS (RV) alliance” (say, a fraction ρRS(ρRV) of the increased profit to Reta and the rest to Supp (Vend)). Reta is willing to cooperate with Supp and Vend to form the RSV alliance, if they negotiate a splitting fraction (ρRSV, ρs) of the increased profit of the RSV alliance (say, a fraction ρRSVof the increased profit to Reta, a fraction ρsof the increased profit to Supp, and the rest to Vend).The increased-profit sharing mechanism can be implemented only if the negotiated fractions satisfy (ρRSV+ ρs) ∈ (0, 1) (or ρRS(ρRV) ∈ (0, 1)). The values of ρRS, ρRVand ρRSVrepresent the Reta’s negotiation ability. The higher the values of ρRS, ρRVand ρRSV, the more powerful Reta’s negotiation ability will be.Proposition 7Given product i is introduced into the market, then Reta chooses the RS alliance ifρRSρRV>ΠARV−ΠVN−ΠRNΠARS−ΠSN−ΠRNandρRSρRSV>ΠARSV−ΠVN−ΠSN−ΠRNΠARS−ΠSN−ΠRN, the RV alliance ifρRVρRS>ΠARS−ΠSN−ΠRNΠARV−ΠVN−ΠRNandρRVρRSV>ΠARSV−ΠVN−ΠSN−ΠRNΠARV−ΠVN−ΠRN, and the RSV alliance otherwise.Proposition 7 shows that if Vend wants to sell product i through Reta, the best option for Reta should be to ally with one or both of Supp and Vend, which mainly depends on the increased-profit-splitting fraction ρRS, ρRVand ρRSV.Suppose Reta requests the same increased-profit-splitting fraction in the three alliance settings, i.e., ρRS=ρRV=ρRSV. This requirement is usually feasible since Reta is the dominator in the supply chain, and Supp/Vend expects Reta to cooperate with himself, which is shown in Proposition 8. Proposition 8 shows the optimal option strategy for Reta under this special increased-profit-splitting scenario.Proposition 8If ρRS= ρRV= ρRSV, the optimal option strategy for Rata is given by:If Ω < 1, Reta chooses the RSV alliance as γ < γRS and the RS alliance as γRS< γ < γU;If Ω ≥ 1, Reta chooses the RSV alliance as γ < γRV and the RV alliance as γRV< γ < γU;where γRS and γRV are the unique root ofEqs. (13)and (14) in the interval (0, γU), respectively.(13)1Ω=(1+γ)[7γ4+36γ3+66γ2+48γ+12−(7γ4+36γ3+66γ2+48γ+12)2−(8b4−γ4)(7γ4+40γ3+76γ2+56γ+14)]γ(7γ4+40γ3+76γ2+56γ+14)(14)Ω=(1+γ)[7γ4+36γ3+66γ2+48γ+12−(7γ4+36γ3+66γ2+48γ+12)2−(8b4−γ4)(7γ4+40γ3+76γ2+56γ+14)]γ(7γ4+40γ3+76γ2+56γ+14)Proposition 8 reflects how the intensity of price competition γ between Supp and Vend influents the optimal option strategy for Reta. Fig. 1shows graphically Proposition 8.RemarkProposition 8 indicates that while Vend is entering the market, Reta should ally with both Supp and Vend to integrate the overall supply chain if the intensity of price competition γ between Supp and Vend is relatively small; otherwise, he/she should ally with the follower having the stronger competitive ability and compete with the other of the weaker competitive ability. It implies that when there is horizontal competition in a supply chain, integrating the overall supply chain is not always the most profitable to Reta. Sometimes it may be better for Reta to ally with one of the two followers but not ally with the other. This observation seems inconsistent with those in most of the existing coordination-related literature, such as Taylor (2002), Cachon and Lariviere (2005), etc., where the integration of supply chain is always beneficial for all of the supply chain members. However, it can be understood easily. Actually, the additional benefits each member obtains from the integration of supply chain mainly come from the elimination of double marginalization incurred by integration. Yet, as shown in Corollary 1, the price competition between Supp and Vend can ameliorate the double marginalization. Moreover, the bigger the intensity of competition, the more effectively the double marginalization will be ameliorated. Therefore, when the intensity of price competition γ between Supp and Vend is big enough, the negative effect of double marginalization on profits for the three partners has become insignificant. It means that Reta has no incentives to integrate all members in the supply chain. In such case, Reta would ally with the stronger supplier rather than the weaker supplier, which is consistent with our intuition.Worthy of mention is that the result in Proposition 8 is based on the assumption of ρRS= ρRV= ρRSV. Without this assumption, it is very difficult to theoretically obtain the optimal option strategy for Reta. Through numerical examples, however, we have analyzed the impact of ρRS, ρRVand ρRSVon the optimal option strategy for Reta. We find that the probability of Reta choosing k (k = RS, RV and RSV) alliance increases as ρkincreases, which makes sense.Consider the following data: ce= 0.5 and ρRV= ρRV= ρRSV= 0.6. From (2), we can get pB= 0.875, wB= 0.625,ΠRB=0.0313andΠSB=0.0156. In order to analyze the impact of parameters γ and Ω on the profits of members in different alliance structures and Reta’s alliance selection strategy, we suppose Ω first takes values 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2, respectively, and then let parameter γ take values (shown in Table 1) less than its upper bound γU, which depends on Ω. Because ce= 0.5 and ci≥ 0 result in Ω = (1 − ci)/(1 − ce) ≤ 2, we assume Ω ≤ 2 in the example. Table 1 shows numerical results we obtain according to the present model.From Table 1, we have the following observations.(1)Under all the alliance structures discussed in the above sections, Reta’s profit increases as the intensity of price competition γ increases. However, Supp’s profit increases as γ increases only when Ω is far less than 1 (say, Ω = 0.25 and 0.5 in Table 1), i.e., Supp has a more absolute advantage in competitive ability than Vend. Vend’s profit increases as γ increases only when Ω is far larger than 1 (say, Ω = 1.5 and 2 in Table 1), i.e., Vend has a more comparative advantage in competitive ability than Supp. It implies that the price competition between Supp and Vend always benefits Reta. Moreover, the fiercer the price competition, the more the Reta’s profit becomes. However, the price competition between Supp and Vend is always harmful to one or both of them. Specifically, when they have the same competitive ability, the competition induces a “lose-lose” outcome for them. In other words, lose-lose case can be avoided in practice by cooperation.Under any of the discussed alliance structures, introducing product i is always better off for Reta because his/her profit after introducing product i are larger than that in Benchmark, respectively. However, in many cases, introducing product i under all the discussed alliance structures is also better off for Supp, especially when Supp has a comparative advantage in competitive ability over Vend (Say, Ω = 0.25 and 0.5 in Table 1). It indicates that in many cases, the introduction of Vend’s product is beneficial to all members.No matter what values parameters γ and Ω take, the No alliance is not a best option for Reta while Vend is entering the supplying market. When Vend is entering the supplying market, the best option strategy for Reta is to ally with the relatively strong supplier and compete with the relatively weaker supplier if the competition intensity is relatively big, and to ally with both the suppliers otherwise. This further verifies Proposition 8.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#


@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In the real business world, the entry/exit of firms is a common phenomenon due to competition. However, most of the existing literature on supply chain management ignored the effects of the entry/exit on the incumbent firms’ decisions. This paper discusses how the upstream entry affects the decision behavior of the incumbent members in a two-echelon supply chain. We find out that when facing an upstream entry a dominant retailer always has incentives to sell the invader's product. Moreover, the introduction of the invader's product is also beneficial to the incumbent supplier in many cases. This observation is a supplement to the existing literature on the entry issue. Our paper also presents how the dominant retailer strategically selects alliance structure to maximize his/her profit by utilizing the upstream entry and the competition between the incumbent supplier and the invader. We show that the optimal strategy for the dominant retailer is not always to coordinate the overall supply chain, but sometimes to only ally with one of the two followers. This is different from much literature on supply chain coordination, where the integrated supply chain structure is always optimal for all entities in a supply chain.There are several directions for future research. First, we assume that Supp neither has rights to deter the entry nor takes measures to threat Reta, e.g., if Reta allows the entry of Vend, Supp will exit the wholesale market or sell product e by adding a direct channel. Considering such situations will make the model more practical and challenging. Second, this paper assumes that the demand is linearly deterministic and the information between firms is symmetric. The cases with nonlinear demand, stochastic demand and asymmetric information are also worthy of research.
