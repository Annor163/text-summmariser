Assessment of advanced glycated end product accumulation in skin using auto fluorescence multispectral imaging

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Advanced glycated end products (AGE) are imaged with a two camera setup.A UV LED light source at 365nm is used for inducing AGE auto fluorescence (AF).Skin tissue AGE is assessed as the relative amount of AF in the 475nm region.Modulated light is used for ambient light cancelation.A significant correlation to current single-point systems shows proof-of-principle.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are long-term indicators of metabolic and glycemic stress that can be found in human skin. They derive from the modifications of proteins or lipids that after contact with aldose sugars become glycated [1]. Factors that affects the formation of AGEs are: extended periods of hyperglycemia; oxidant stress in the cellular environment; and the rate of turnover of proteins for glycoxidation [2].AGEs can also be absorbed through the diet [3]. Foods high in protein and fat are especially rich in AGEs. In addition, increased cooking temperatures, like broiling and frying, and increased cooking times lead to increased amounts of AGEs [4].Inside the tissue, AGEs can alter cell structure and function, contribute to diabetes related micro- and macrovascular complications [5], and may modify the extracellular matrix [6]. They may also lead to the release of free radicals [6], block the activity of nitric oxide inside the endothelium [7] and increase the amount of reactive oxygen species [8]. When the AGEs have been formed inside the tissue, their turnover time is very long.Considering the negative effects of AGEs in tissue, an objective way of quantify such an accumulation is of clinical value. Since several AGEs exhibit characteristic fluorescence, this physical effect can be exploited to perform a non-invasive assessment of accumulation increases into human tissues. Significant correlations have been found between skin autofluorescence (AF) and levels of skin AGEs like pentosidine, as obtained from skin biopsies when studying e.g. diabetes mellitus [9]. Skin AF can be used as a predictor for assessing how diseases with increased cardiovascular risk develops. Koetsier et al. [10] suggest that UV stimulations by a broad excitation range of 355â€“405nm, is adequate for inducing AF for diagnostic purposes.A commercial device, the AGE Reader (Diagnoptics Technologies B.V., Groningen, The Netherlands), has become available to assess skin auto fluorescence for clinical purposes [11]. A black light tube, with a peak wavelength of 370nm is used to illuminate a small region of the skin on the forearm. An optical fiber detects the emission and reflected excitation light, and a spectrometer is used to measure the intensity spectrum. This device is limited to single-point measurements performed in contact to forearm skin.The aim of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of quantifying fluorescent AGE deposits in skin tissue using a two-camera setup with optical band pass filters during ultraviolet (UV) exposure. Such a tool enables the analysis of the spatial distribution of AGE in tissue and can be used in devices devoted to remote monitoring and self-monitoring whenever trends in AGE tissue content are required to be traced over time, such as a smart mirror. Incorporating physiological measurements in a smart mirror will increase its medical value [12]. As a proof-of-concept, the AGE level quantified with the proposed camera setup will be compared to readings from a commercial instrument for single point measurements performed in contact to arm skin tissue.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
AGE measured with MSI in forearm skin was significantly correlated (p=0.005) with the AGE reference method (AGE Reader on forearm skin). The relationship to AGE with MSI in facial skin was slightly weaker and borderline significant (p=0.078). This could indicates that the AGE content varies between forearm and facial skin areas. The recordings of AGE level with ambient light turned on showed only a minor influence of ambient light. These results show proof-of-principle for measuring AGE with the suggested MSI set-up. Longitudinal measurements are needed to determine reproducibility and also to determine the importance of the skin site used for AGE determination (face vs forearm). The main findings in this study indicate that it is possible to use multispectral imaging for non-touch assessment of skin AGE content.The authors certify that they have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest (such as honoraria; educational grants; participation in speakers' bureaus; membership, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements), or non-financial interest (such as personal or professional relationships, affiliations, knowledge or beliefs) in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.
