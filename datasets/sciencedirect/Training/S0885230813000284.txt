Ranked WordNet graph for Sentiment Polarity Classification in Twitter

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The purpose of this article is to present a novel approach to Sentiment Polarity Detection in Twitter posts.We propose a non-supervised and domain-independent solution to Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.The method combines SentiWordNet scores with a random walk analysis of the concepts found in the text over the WordNet graph.Several experiments have been performed in order to compare them with other approaches like machine learning solutions.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a novel approach to Sentiment Polarity Classification in Twitter posts, by extracting a vector of weighted nodes from the graph of WordNet. These weights are used in SentiWordNet to compute a final estimation of the polarity. Therefore, the method proposes a non-supervised solution that is domain-independent. The evaluation of a generated corpus of tweets shows that this technique is promising.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The birth of Web 2.0 supposed a breaking down of the barrier between the consumers and producers of information, i.e. the Web has changed from a static container of information into a live environment in which any user, in a very simple manner, can publish any type of information. This simplified means of publication has led to the rise of several different websites specializing in the publication of users opinions. Some of the most well-known sites include Epinions,11http://epinions.com.RottenTomatoes22http://rottentomatoes.com.and Muchocine,33http://muchocine.net.where users express their opinions or criticisms on a wide range of topics. Opinions published on the Internet are not limited to certain sites, but rather can be found in a blog, forum, commercial website or any other site allowing posts from visitors.One of the most representative tools of the Web 2.0 are social networks, which allow millions of users to publish any information in a simple way and to share it with their network of contacts or “friends”. These social networks have also evolved and become a continuous flow of information. A clear example is the microblogging platform Twitter.44http://twitter.com.Twitter publishes all kinds of information, disseminating views on many different topics: politics, business, economics and so on. Twitter users regularly publish their comments on a particular news item, a recently purchased product or service, and ultimately on everything that happens around them. This has aroused the interest of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, which has begun to study the texts posted on Twitter, and more specifically related to Sentiment Analysis (SA) challenges.In this manuscript we present a new approach to the scoring of posts according to the positive or negative degree of the opinions expressed in the text. This polarity classification problem is resolved by combining SentiWordNet scores with a random walk analysis of the concepts found in the text over the WordNet graph. In order to validate our non-supervised approach, several experiments have been performed in order to analyze major issues in our method and to compare it with other approaches like plain SentiWordNet scoring or machine learning solutions such as Support Vector Machines in a supervised approach. The paper is structured as follows: First, an introduction to the polarity classification problem is provided, followed by the description of our approach. Then the experimental method is described with a description of the generated corpus and the results obtained. Finally, conclusions and further work are discussed.
