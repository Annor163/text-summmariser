@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes a generalization of the ordinary de Casteljau algorithm to manifold-valued data including an important special case which uses the exponential map of a symmetric space or Riemannian manifold. We investigate some basic properties of the corresponding Bézier curves and present applications to curve design on polyhedra and implicit surfaces as well as motion of rigid body and positive definite matrices. Moreover, we apply our approach to construct canal and developable surfaces.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In various applications like medical imaging, elasticity, array signal processing and dynamics, one has to deal with data living in a manifold, Lie group or more generally symmetric space. In several works including Ur Rahman et al. (2005), Wallner and Dyn (2005), Wallner and Pottmann (2006), Wallner et al. (2007), Grohs (2009, 2010), Nava-Yazdani (2008), Xie and Yu (2008), Nava-Yazdani and Yu (2011), Itai and Sharon (2013) and Ebner (2013) subdivision schemes have been generalized and applied to nonlinear settings. Besides subdivision schemes, the de Casteljau algorithm is of significant importance in modeling and computer aided geometric design. There are several publications on Bézier curves in the sphere including the early work (Shoemake, 1985). Moreover, Li et al. (2010) generalize the classical de Casteljau algorithm for constructing spherical Bézier based on corner cutting. For further approaches and modifications concerning the de Casteljau algorithm in certain nonlinear cases we refer to Park and Ravani (1995), Crouch et al. (1999) and Jakubiak et al. (2006). In the present work, we introduce a framework generalizing previous results to manifold-valued data and study some of main properties of the resulting Bézier curve. For many practical purposes geodesics are computationally too expensive or time-consuming. We show how to use alternative approaches preserving main desired properties of the construction. Moreover, we present applications to the geodesic Bézier approach for polyhedral surfaces, Euclidean group of motion and diffusion tensors and also use the produced curves to construct canal and ruled surfaces. Throughout this work M denotes aCkmanifold, smooth stands forCkand we refer top0,…,pn∈Mas control points.Definition 1Suppose that for eachx∈Mthere is a neighborhoodUxand a map[0,1]×Ux∋(t,y)↦Φt(x,y)∈Uxsuch thatΦtis smooth in x and y. We callL(x,y):={Φt(x,y):0⩽t⩽1}the segment from x to y and the function Φ basic iff the following holds.x≠yimplies thatL(x,y)is a simple and regular curve, i.e.,t↦Φt(x,y)is an injective immersion and(1)Φ0(x,y)=x,(2)Φ1(x,y)=y,(3)L(x,x)={x}.In particular, if the map Φ is globally defined (Ux=M), then it is a smooth homotopy between the first and second coordinate projection ofM×Mrelative to the diagonaldiag(M):={(x,x):x∈M}.Letg(x,y):=Φ˙0(x,y). We call Φ locally rigid if for eachx∈Mthe identityD2g(x,x)=Idholds. As the mapx↦Φ⋅(x,⋅)is in general only locally defined, in the following we assume that the control points are close enough, i.e., there is a neighborhood U of{p0,…,pn}such thatx,y∈U⇒L(x,y)⊂U.Next, we define the (Φ-) de Casteljau algorithm.Definition 2pi0(t):=pi,r=1,…,n,i=0,…,n−r,pir(t):=Φt(pir−1(t),pi+1r−1(t)),0⩽t⩽1.Letp(t):=p0n(t). Let us callB(p0,…,pn):=p([0,1])the Bézier curve with control pointsp0,…,pn. Obviously, this curve is invariant under affine parameter transformations and satisfiesp(0)=p0andp(1)=pn.Definition 3We callL(p0,…,pn):=⋃i=0n−1L(pi,pi+1)the polygon ofp0,…,pn.In our framework many properties of the Bézier curve and its parametrization p from the linear case remain valid. Smoothness of p is an immediate consequence of the fact that p is constructed as a finite composition of smooth operations andL(x,y)is a smooth curve for allx,y∈U, provided M and Φ are smooth. Moreover, reversing the order of control points does not affect their Bézier curve:B(pn,…,p0)=B(p0,…,pn).Suppose now0=t0<t1<⋯<tn=1. Our algorithm can simply be modified to produce a solution to the interpolation problemp(ti)=piby settingpir(t)=Φt−titi+r−ti(pir−1(t),pi+1r−1(t))(Aitkenʼs algorithm).Example 4Suppose that M is a convex subset of the general linear groupGLn. ThenΦt(x,y)=x((1−t)y+tx)−1ydefines a rational basic function on M. In many applications a natural symmetry condition to impose on a basic function is the followingL(x,y)=L(y,x).In this example a rational basic function meeting the symmetry condition is given byΦt(x,y)=12(x((1−t)y+tx)−1y+y((1−t)y+tx)−1x).Example 5Letx,y∈R2. Then the circle with the diameter‖x−y‖and centerx+y2given byΦt(x,y)=12((x+y)+[cos(πt)sin(πt)−sin(πt)cos(πt)](x−y))defines a basic function onR2.In many applications, using a point wise linear structure associated to M and having a corresponding geometric or physical interpretation in mind, we may construct a basic function Φ as follows.Definition 6LetTxM∋g(x,y):=Φ˙0(x,y). We call Φ dynamical iff there is a mapf:TM→Msuch that for each x there exists a neighborhood U of x with(4)Φt(x,y)=f(x,tg(x,y))for each0⩽t⩽1,y∈U.Note that in this casef(x,0)=x,f(x,g(x,y))=y,f(x,(s+t)g(x,y))=f(f(x,tg(x,y)),sg(x,y))(local flow property).A good example to have in mind is the following. Let M be Riemannian andf=expthe Riemannian exponential map. In this case, ifx,y∈Uwith a distance within the injectivity radius of f at x, theng(x,y)is the velocity andΦ(x,y)is the geodesic from x to y. Moreover, if M is geodesically complete, then f is defined on whole TM and any two points can be joined by a (not necessarily unique) geodesic. For instance, see example 1. Another class of important applications is given, if M is a Lie group or more generally a symmetric space with f the exponential map. Note that if M is a Lie group admitting a bi-invariant metric (e.g., if M is compact), then the Lie group exponential map coincides with the Riemannian one.If M is just the m-dimensional Euclidean spaceRm, thenTM=Rm×Rm,f(x,v)=x+vandg(x,y)=y−x. In this case, Definition 2 gives the ordinary linear de Casteljau algorithm. Other examples are provided by g being the nearest point projection in the ambient Euclidean space onto M as well as stereographic projection in case of a sphere. In this examplesTM=M×RNand the maps f and g are independent of the base point x. Another example is given byg(x,y)the orthogonal projection of y toTxMthe tangent space at x. Compared to the geodesic construction, this approach has the advantages that it is computationally less time-consuming (f and g are simpler) and one needs only to deal with the resp. linearization of the manifold M at the control points. Next, consider any chart aroundx∈Uand replace f and g by their local representation. Let us denote derivatives of f and g in the first resp. second argument byD1fresp.D2fandD1gresp.D2g. Due tof(x,g(x,y))=ywe have(5)D1f(x,g(x,y))+D2f(x,g(x,y))D1g(x,y)=0,(6)D2f(x,g(x,y))D2g(x,y)=Id.We say that f is locally rigid iff(7)D2f(x,0)=Idfor allx∈U.We remark that this property is independent of the chosen chart. Moreover, due tof(x,0)=xwe haveD1f(x,0)=Idon U. Note that (3) impliesg(x,x)=0. Hence, in view of (6) local rigidity of Φ is equivalent to (7).Definition 7Suppose that the basic function is given by the pair(f,g)as defined above. We callC(p0,…,pn):=⋃i=0n{f(pi,∑j=0ntjg(pi,pj)):∑j=0ntj=1,tj∈R⩾0,j=0,…,n}the convex hull ofp0,…,pn.Note that the Bézier curveB(p0,…,pn)is entirely contained in the convex hull ofp0,…,pn. Furthermore, if control points lie on the segment between endpoints, then the corresponding Bézier curve coincides with that segment:p1,…,pn−1∈L(p0,pn)⇒B(p0,…,pn)=L(p0,…,pn).The following theorem summarizes further properties of the de Casteljauʼs algorithm.Theorem 8Consider control pointsP:=(p0,…,pn)andQ:=(q0,…,qn)in U. Then the following holds.a)Transformation invariance: Suppose a Lie group H acts on M byH×M∋(h,x)↦hx∈Mleaving U invariant, i.e.,HU⊂U. If the action is segment-equivariant, i.e., for everyh∈G,hL(x,y)=L(hx,hy)for allx,y∈U.ThenhB(p0,…,pn)=B(hp0,…,hpn)for allh∈H.Local control: Consider (w.l.o.g.) M as embedded in a Euclidean space with any norm‖.‖. Then‖p−q‖∞⩽C‖P−Q‖∞where C denotes a positive constant depending only on n, U and Φ.Endpoint velocity: Suppose that Φ is given by(f,g). Denotep˙(t):=ddtp(t)andΔpi:=g(pi,pi+1). If f meets the local rigid condition(7), then:p˙(0)=nΔp0,p˙(1)=nΔpn−1.ProofFor a) note that the segmentsL(hpi,hpi+1)andhL(pi,pi+1)have the same endpoints:Φ0(hpi,hpi+1)=hpi=hΦ0(pi,pi+1),Φ1(hpi,hpi+1)=hpi+1=hΦ1(pi,pi+1).To show b) note that by finiteness of n there is a positive constant K determined by U and Lipschitz constants of Φ on U such that‖pir(t)−qir(t)‖=‖Φt(pir−1(t),pi+1r−1(t))−Φt(qir−1(t),qi+1r−1(t))‖⩽K‖(pir−1(t),pi+1r−1(t))−(qir−1(t),qi+1r−1(t))‖.Iteration yields‖p(t)−q(t)‖=‖p0n(t)−q0n(t)‖⩽Kn‖P−Q‖∞for all0⩽t⩽1which immediately results in the desired inequality. To prove c) definepi′=pn−ifori=0,…,nand note that the Bézier curve with control pointspn′,…,p0′coincides with the one corresponding top0,…,pn. Hence the velocity vector of the curveB(pn′,…,p0′)atpn′is the same as the velocity vector ofB(p0,…,pn)atp0. On the other handp(1−t)=p′(t)impliesp˙(0)=−p˙′(1). Therefore, the second equation in c) follows from the first one. Now, applying (5) and (6) the de Casteljau algorithm yieldsp˙ir=(1−t)D1f(pir−1,tg(pir−1,pi+1r−1))p˙ir−1+tp˙i+1r−1+D2f(pir−1,tg(pir−1,pi+1r−1))g(pir−1,pi+1r−1).Iterating this formula yields fori=0andr=np˙(t)=∑k=0n−1∑j=0k(kj)(1−t)jtk−jD1f(.,.)…D1f(.,.)︸jtimesD2f(.,.)g(pk−jn−1−k,pk−j+1n−1−k)where all second arguments ofD1f(.,.)andD2f(.,.)evaluate to zero att=0. Settingt=0in this formula and using the assumptionsD2f(pi,0)=IdandD1f(pi,0)=Idwe arrive atp˙(0)=nΔp0.  □Given a basic function Φ on a manifold M, in many applications there is a canonical way to construct another basic functionΦ′and the corresponding Bézier curves/patches etc. on a manifoldM′. To proceed, we first present the followingDefinition 9Suppose that Φ resp.Φ′are basic functions on manifolds M resp.M′. We call Φ andΦ′conjugate iff there is a diffeomorphismH:M→M′such that for each0⩽t⩽1andx,y∈MH(Φt(x,y)):=Φt′(H(x),H(y))and writeΦ≃HΦ′.Obviously ≃ defines an equivalence relation. Next we show how to construct new basic functions from a given one and provide flexibility in design of new Bézier curves.Theorem 10Suppose that Φ resp.Φ′are basic functions on manifolds M resp.M′andΦ≃HΦ′. Then the following holdsa)If Φ is dynamical, thenΦ′is also dynamical.Letp(.)resp.p′(.)denote the parametrization of Bézier curves corresponding top0,…,pnresp.H(p0),…,H(pn). ThenH(p(.))=p′(.). ParticularlyH(B(p0,…,pn))=B(H(p0),…,H(pn)).LetΦ˜be a basic functions on M. ThenΨt(x,y):=Φ˜t(Φt(x,y),Φt(x,y))is also a basic function on M.Proofa) Define the functionsf′:TM′↦M′andg′:M′×M′↦TM′byf′(x′,v′)=H(f(x,v)),g′(x′,y′)=dxHg(x,y)wherex′,y′∈M′,v′∈Tx′M′,x′=H(x)andy′=H(y′). We can writeΦt′(x′,y′)=H(Φt(x,y))=H(f(x,tg(x,y)))=f′(x′,dxH(tg(x,y)))=f′(x′,tdxH(g(x,y)))=f′(x′,tg′(x′,y′)).b) and c) are straightforward.  □Next, we present two applications of the preceding theorem.Example 11Suppose that computing a Bézier curve in a manifoldM′in terms of a basic functionΦ′is more manageable then in M andH:M→M′is a diffeomorphism. Then, we may use the basic functionΦt(x,y):=H−1(Φt′(H(x),H(y)))on M. As example suppose that M is implicitly given by a submersionh:R3→RasM=h(0)andH3=h. Then choosingΦ′as the ordinary affine linear function givesΦt(x,y)=H−1((1−t)H(x)+H(y))on M.Besides geometric and design issues, computational aspects are of great importance in most applications. Particularly, a polynomial or at least rational basic function is desirable. Note that the corresponding Bézier curve enjoys the same property.Example 12Let π denote the stereographic projection from the north pole ofM=SmontoRm. ThenΦt(x,y):=π−1((1−t)π(x)+tπ(y))defines a rational basic function onSm.From a geometric view point the following is a natural property for applications in design and geometric approximation.Definition 13We call a basic function Φ on M segmenting iff for eachx,z∈M(8)y∈L(x,z)⇒L(x,y)∪L(y,z)=L(x,z).Note that the basic functions given in Examples 4 and 5 are not segmenting. Moreover, every dynamical function is segmenting. Next, we characterize dynamical functions in terms of above geometric intuitive property.Theorem 14Suppose that Φ is a locally rigid basic segmenting function on M. Then Φ is dynamical.ProofFixx∈M. Due to local rigidity there is a neighborhood U of x such thatU∋y↦g(x,y):=Φ˙0(x,y)is injective. Letf(x,.):=g(x,.)|U−1andv∈g(x,U). Then there existsz∈Uwithg(x,z)=v. Lety∈L(x,z), i.e.,y=Φt(x,z)for some0⩽t⩽1. Since[0,1]∋s↦Φst(x,z)parametrizesL(x,y)and due to segmenting propertyL(x,y)⊂L(x,z), we haveg(x,y)=dds|s=0Φst(x,z)=tΦ˙0(x,z)=tg(x,z). HenceΦt(x,z)=y=f(x,g(x,y))=f(x,tg(x,z)).  □Example 15The choicef=expwhere exp denotes the Riemannian exponential map on M leads to the geodesic de Casteljauʼs algorithm. Fig. 1illustrates the corresponding Bézier curve on a torus. This approach requires solving the geodesic boundary value problem. Another choice is the computationally more suitable mapg(x,y)given by the orthogonal projection of y to the tangent plane of the surface at x,g(x,y)=y−x−〈y−x,n〉nandf(x,⋅)the local inverse of g. Here〈.,.〉denotes the Euclidean scalar product and n stands for the normal at x. For few examples geodesics are explicitly known. For instance consider the 2-sphereM=S2with f the Riemannian exponential mapf(x,v)=cos(‖v‖)x+sin(‖v‖)v‖v‖,g(x,y)=arccos(〈x,y〉)y−〈x,y〉x‖y−〈x,y〉x‖,x,ynot antipodal.The resulting segment between x and y is just the geodesicΦt(x,y)=sin((1−t)φ)sinφx+sin(tφ)sinφywherecosφ=〈x,y〉. The orthogonal projection of y to the tangent plane of the sphere at x and its local inverse are given byg(x,y)=y−〈x,y〉x,f(x,v)=v+1−‖v‖2x,resulting in the segmentΦ˜t(x,y)=(1−t2sin2φ−tcosφ)x+ty.Note that in this exampleΦ˜(x,y)is just a reparametrization ofΦ(x,y)as for the sphere both curves coincide with the arc of the great circle joining x and y.Next, we consider Lie groups. We denote the Lie group of special orthogonal matrices bySOn, i.e.,SOn:={x∈Rn×n:xxt=id,det(x)=1},where id denotes the identity matrix in the general linear groupGLn. In general, if M is a Lie group, then the exponential map is given byf(x,v)=xexp(v)=x∑k=0∞1k!vkwherex∈Mand v is a vector in the Lie algebraLie(M)of M. As our consideration is local, using Adoʼs theorem (Spivak, 1970, Chapter 10), we may and do assume that M is a subgroup of the general linear groupGLn. Now, ifh∈GLnsatisfies‖I−h‖<1(for any matrix norm‖.‖), then log is well-defined and given bylog(h)=∑k=1∞1k(I−h)k.Considering M as a subgroup ofGLn, we also may take the orthogonal projection. In the following example we compare this two choices of f.Example 16Letx∈SE3whereSE3denotes the special group of Euclidean motion. Then we havex=[qb01],with q being a rotation inR3, i.e.,q∈SO3andb∈R3(translation). The standard scalar product forx,y∈Rn×nis given by〈x,y〉=tr(xyt)and the induced norm is the Frobenius norm‖x‖=(∑j=1n∑i=1nxij)1/2.The closest point projectionfπontoSE3can be computed efficiently using singular value decomposition (see Golub and Van Loan, 1996). Letq=usvtbe a singular decomposition of q whereqtstands for the transpose of q. It is well known thatargminz∈SO3‖q−z‖=uvt=(qqt)−1/2qprovideddet(q)>0. Hence we havefπ(x)=[(qqt)−1/2qb01].Let us denote the Bernstein polynomials of degree n byB0,…,Bn. For control pointsp0,…,pn∈SE3we define the Bézier curve inSE3as the closest point projection of the corresponding Bézier curve∑i=0nBi(t)piin the ambient Euclidean spaceR4×4ontoSE3p(t)=fπ(∑i=0nBi(t)pi)=fπ([∑i=0nBi(t)qi∑i=0nBi(t)bi01]).For well-definedness we have to show that for all0⩽t⩽1the conditiondet(∑i=0nBi(t)qi)>0holds. Since∑j=0nBj(t)=1for all0⩽t⩽1, we have‖∑i=0nBi(t)qi−q1‖=‖∑i=0nBi(t)(qi−q1)‖⩽∑i=0nBi(t)maxi‖qi−q1‖=maxi‖qi−q1‖.In view ofdet(q1)=1and continuity of det it follows that for sufficiently dense control points the desired conditiondet(∑i=0nBi(t)qi)>0is satisfied. Note that another advantage of this choice of f is independency of base point (g(x,y)=y,f(x,v)=fπ(v)andΛ=R4×4), resulting in a faster approach (see Fig. 2). A vector v in the Lie algebrase3ofSE3has the formv=[hu00].Hereh∈so3whereso3consisting of 3 by 3 skew-symmetric matrices stands for the Lie algebra ofSO3andu∈R3. The exponential map ofSE3reads nowExp(x,v)=x[exp(h)Hu01],H:=1+1−cos(‖h‖)‖h‖2h+‖h‖−sin(‖h‖)‖h3‖h2. The logarithm in this case is given byLog(x,x′)=x−1[log(q′)H−1b′00]wherex′=[q′b′01].Example 17Another map useful in computations forSOnis given by the Cayley mapf(x,v):=x(I+12v)(I−12v)−1withx∈SO3,v∈so3.Its point wise inverse isg(x,y)=−2(I−x−1y)(I+x−1y)−1withx,y∈SO3.The Cayley map provides a suitable linearization of the exponential map near identity. In contrast to the exponential map it is rational. This fact is useful in numerical applications, since evaluating transcendental functions can be time-consuming. Cayley map is a first order Padé approximation. In our example any higher order Padé approximation can be used to increase accuracy.Next, we consider the generalization of Lie groups to symmetric spaces. There are various applications of symmetric spaces in many areas and their structure admits the notion of exponential map. Positive definite symmetric matrices provide a prominent example of a symmetric space and arise in many applications like elasticity and medical imaging. Affine subspaces of Euclidean space provide further examples. For convenient of the reader, we recall some basic facts and refer to Wallner et al. (2011) and Nava-Yazdani and Yu (2011) for details. Suppose that M is a homogeneous space, i.e.,M=G/Kwhere K is a Lie subgroup of a Lie group G. Then M is called a symmetric space iff there is an involutive automorphisms∈Aut(G)∖{id},s2=idsuch that the fixpoint set of s denoted byFix(s)is closed and contained in K, and K andFix(s)have the same identity component.Example 18Let us consider the space of positive definite symmetricn×nmatricesPosn=GLn/Onwith its exponential mapExp(x,v)=x12exp(x−12vx−12)x12and the logarithm which is globally definedLog(x,y)=x12log(x−12yx−12)x12.Herex,y∈Posnandv∈Symn(symmetricn×nmatrices).Posnis also a Riemannian symmetric space with the geodesic distance given byd(x,y)=‖log(x−12yx−12)‖.Moreover, the corresponding geodesic joining x and y is given byΦt(x,y)=x1/2(x−1/2y1/2x−1/2)tx1/2.Note that the corresponding Bézier curve inPosncoincides with the one inherited as a subset ofGLn, sincex12exp(x−12vx−12)x12=xexp(x−1v).Fig. 3shows an application of de Casteljauʼs algorithm to four control points inPos3.Example 19This example addresses construction of Bézier curves on polyhedral surfaces. In polyhedra, one can consider shortest as well as straightest geodesics (see Figs. 4 and 5). The concept of straightest geodesics has been introduced by Polthier and Schmies (1998). Straightest geodesics in polyhedral surfaces are characterized by the property that at inner point of an edge outbound and inbound angles coincide and at a vertex left and right angles sum up to half of total vertex-angle (see Fig. 6). In contrast to shortest, straightest geodesics uniquely solve the geodesic initial value problem (see Polthier and Schmies, 1998). Moreover a straightest geodesic coincides with the shortest, provided the geodesic does not pass through a spherical vertex. Hence, for an initial pointx∈Mand initial velocity v the Riemannian exponential mapexp(x,v)is the endpoint of the corresponding straightest geodesic. As for n vertices computation of the endpointexp(x,v)is done by a loop using at most all n vertices, the underlying time complexity is justO(n). The optimal algorithm for the computation oflog(x,y), i.e., the initial velocity of the shortest path joining x and y in M can be found in Chen and Han (1996) resp. Schreiber and Sharir (2006) and has time complexityO(n2)resp.O(nlogn)for convex polyhedra.Many important surfaces can be constructed as a 1-parameter family of simple curves. The most important examples are canal and ruled surfaces (1-parameter family of circles resp. straight lines). Envelope of a family of spheres whose centers lie on a space curve is a canal surface. Particularly, if the sphere centers lie on a straight line, then the canal surface is a surface of revolution. A surface S is ruled if through every point of S there is a straight line that lies on S. Hence it can be parametrized as a one-parameter family of straight lines. For applications of canal and ruled surfaces in architecture we refer to Pottmann et al. (2007).Example 20Consider a canal surface S generated by a regular curve m, i.e.,S:x(s,t)=m(t)+r(t)(cos(s)N(t)+sin(s)B(t))with N the normal and B the binormal of the curve m and0⩽t⩽1,0⩽s<2π. Denote the unit tangent map of the curve m by n. We may write S asS=⋃0⩽t⩽1StwhereStdenotes the circle with centerm(t)and radiusr(t)in the plane through the pointm(t)with the normaln(t). Now, given control points(mi,ri,ni)∈R3×R+×S2we may apply our approach to construct an approximation of the surface S (see Figs. 7 and 8).Example 21For control pointsp0,…,pnin a ruled surface given byS:x(s,t)=m(t)+sv(t)we may writepi=(mi,vi)∈R3×S2.Our approach can also be applied to produce further classical surfaces. For instance, Pinkall (2008) gives a constructive approach to design cylinders with constant negative curvature using their characterization via Gauß map. Therein the task is reduced to refine a discrete Chebyshev net in the 2-sphere. The Chebyshev net is completely determined by initial pointsNi,iandNi+1,i. Due to Theorem 3 applying Definition 2 parallelograms refine to parallelograms. Hence we may apply Definition 2 withM=S2and f and g from our first example to construct the net. Using the method described in Pinkall (2008) the surface can then be reconstructed (see Fig. 9).
