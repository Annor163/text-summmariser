@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Piston skirt in an internal combustion engine (ICE) plays an important part in the way of power transmission, and piston set is one of the most important components in an internal combustion engine. Its characteristics have great effect on the sealing performance, friction loss, oil consumption and noise. Today, the technology of the reciprocating engine is very mature, having been developed extensively over the past century as the prime mover for the automotive industry, significant improvement has led to in power density, efficiency, and emissions in recent decades. Reducing friction can improve efficiency without harming emissions, while simultaneously reducing wear and improving the reliability of the engine. The research showed that 5% of total engine fuel energy is dissipated through the piston assembly friction loss, mainly due to piston skirt and piston ring pack loss, piston assembly accounts for 20–30% of mechanical loss for a typical gasoline engine [1]. At the same time, the whole loss from the whole piston contributes to 58–75% loss of the whole engine friction loss [2]. Richardson provides a summary of recent literature and testing experience in sources of engine friction, the research showed that 45–55% mechanical friction loss is dissipate from piston system, and piston skirt contributes 25–47% in this component [3]. Priest and Taylor, in their analysis of engine friction conclude a 10% reduction in mechanical losses would lead to a 1.5% reduction in fuel consumption. Fox found that the piston skirt and rings had the greatest potential for improvement from a reduction in boundary friction [4]. It is necessary to quantitatively assess the piston assembly friction in order to optimize the piston ring pack and the piston skirt geometries. A well-designed skirt will result in the optimal operation of the engine, low friction, low noise, low oil consumption, low emissions and ultimately long engine life.Apart from big friction loss coming from the piston skirt, one of the major noise and vibration sources in internal combustion engine is impacted by the secondary motion between the piston and cylinder wall [5], the clearance between the piston and liner is very small but large enough to induce the piston’s secondary motion periodically and finally generates unwanted sound and vibration [6]. Secondary motion across the clearance between piston and cylinder inner wall and then side thrust force induced by the connecting rod, the piston moves from one side to opposite side in the cylinder. Eventually, the piston collides against the cylinder inner wall and slaps the liner, so the sound is radiated to the environment. The oil film between the piston skirt and the cylinder inner wall would experience reaction forces induced by the vertical piston movement and the lateral piston movement. In the traditional isolation design of piston, only the lubrication of piston is considered, while piston-slap induced exciting components of force and moment are of much less concern or neglected to simplify the analysis and design. It has been demonstrated by both analytically and experimentally that piston-slap is a major excitation source of air-borne noise from an internal combustion piston engine, especially from turbo-charged diesels. Joseph [7] eliminated piston slap through a design for robustness CAE approach, in the paper, these factors were investigated by DOE method, factors that affected the slap noise weight was analyzed. Cho [8] and Geng [9]used the simple model to estimate the impact force induced by piston slap, but the detail parameters was not considered. Gerges [10]found oil film was an important factor on the impact behavior, Reynolds’ theory for fluid film squeezing can be applied for oil film damping determination, the effective damping was found to be inversely proportional to the oil film thickness cubed, the influence of cylinder lubrication on the piston slap was investigated.To make deeper research on the wear mechanism and secondary motion of the piston or validate the piston motion model, many kinds of methods are used to test the lubrication or wear, which can be concluded that: (1) Bench test [11]; (2) Floating liner [12]; (3) Realistic engine test [13], but researches mainly focused on the piston ring. Compared with lubrication and wear test, researches of experiment focused on mechanism of the secondary motion and slap noised by the impact are few, an indirect measurement of the piston secondary motion of a diesel engine was reported to analyze the piston slap [8]. Tan and Ripin developed an experimental technique to measure frictional behavior and the distinct modes of piston secondary motion, the piston motion and tilt angle were captured using two laser displacement sensors, the lateral motion are verified by comparing the frequency components of the lateral motion with the frequency components of the lateral acceleration measured using a triaxial accelerometer [14,15]. Later, a nonlinear model of the piston with reciprocating, lateral and rotational degree of freedom was developed to investigate the piston secondary motion and the induced vibration behavior of the engine block by the piston slap, the model was validated by experimental data obtained from three laser displacement sensors which captured the distinct modes of the piston secondary motion directly from the piston assembly under motorized conditions [16].In fact, the piston skirt dynamic motion model can be divided as Reynolds model and secondary model, Reynolds model that considered the roughness was put forward Patir and Cheng [17], but it was first used in piston ring lubrication problem, then Knoll and Peeken [18] studied the lubrication, it was used in bearing, until Li [19] put out the mathematic model of the lubrication. Richmond [20] found that the clearance and ellipicity of piston had great effect on the slapping noise, too small gap will affect the formation of the oil film, bigger clearance will intensify the noise. Zhu [21,22] established the dynamic model of the piston skirt, he coupled the Patir and Cheng model to analyze the secondary motion and lubrication, thermal deformation was considered to the model. In practice engineering, the lubrication and noise is a trade-off problem. Piston design for noise analysis mainly focuses on the parameters: clearance, piston skirt stiffness, skirt profile, piston pin offset, and piston skirt length, ellipicity of piston, cylinder pressure, and initial force and so on. Nakashima changed the piston pin offset and centroid height to improve slapping noise at every speed, the noise was reduced clearly [23]. Kim found that the geometry that decided by the type line can reduce the wear of the piston [24]. Malagi [25] had done the lubrication before, and made comparison for the lubrication characteristics after the deformation before. Yang [26] found that the suitable region of piston skirt and clearance was very important, and the reducing of piston skirt length can reduce friction loss. Yang [27] showed that the length of piston skirt was design according to guidance and compact pressure. Takayuki optimized the profile of the skirt with the analytical model, it was confirmed that the piston slap excitation is reduced after optimization [28].From literature reviewed, most researchers focused on the lubrication model, secondary motion model, lubrication experiment and numerical method to solve Reynolds equation. Morphology of the piston skirt and liner and oil sample models are also added to obtain the more realistic lubrication condition and boundary. Apart from the above analyses, experiment is also carried to obtain more precise boundary lubrication and dynamic characteristics, all the results are all provided the guidance to reduce noise and friction loss. In this paper, the piston skirt-liner system of a typical inline diesel engine with six cylinders is used. Finite element method is used to solve the Reynolds equation, secondary motion of piston skirt is solved with fixed step Runge–kutta method. The effects of some parameters on the noise are listed, such as: clearance, offset of piston pin, piston skirt length, bump position, curvature parameter and ellipticity of the piston. The lubrication and dynamic characteristics are discussed, such as: minimumoil film thicknesses (MOFT), friction loss, displacement (et, eb), tilt angle and rotational velocity are compared, especially the lateral velocity and rotational velocity which have great effect on the noise. All the results can be used in the development of the pistonto reduce noise.The Reynolds equation is the basic of the lubrication analysis, it is derived by Navier–Stokes, and incompressible fluid satisfies the continuity equation:(1)DρDt+ρ∂u∂x+∂v∂y+∂w∂zThe momentum equations are written as:(2)ρDuDt=ρX-∂p∂x+23∂∂xμ∂u∂x-∂v∂y+∂u∂x-∂w∂z+∂∂yμ∂v∂x+∂u∂y+∂∂zμ∂w∂x+∂u∂z(3)ρDvDt=ρY-∂p∂y+23∂∂yμ∂v∂y-∂u∂x+∂v∂y-∂w∂z+∂∂xμ∂v∂x+∂u∂y+∂∂zμ∂w∂y+∂v∂z(4)ρDwDt=ρZ-∂p∂z+23∂∂yμ∂w∂z-∂u∂x+∂w∂z-∂v∂y+∂∂yμ∂v∂z+∂w∂y+∂∂xμ∂w∂x+∂u∂zThe lubrication model between the piston and liner is always considered as hydrodynamic lubrication model, according to the average flow model that was put forward by Patir and Cheng [17], when the effect of surface wave on the lubrication is considered, the average Reynolds equation between the piston skirt and liner is written as follow:(5)∂∂xϕxh312μ∂p∂x+∂∂yϕyh312μ∂p∂y=u2∂hT‾∂x+u2σ∂ϕs∂x+∂hT‾∂twhere μ is dynamic viscosity of oil film, φx,φyis pressure flow factor along x, y direction, respectively. φsis the shear flow factor, σ is the roughness of surface, p is the oil film pressure, h is the oil film thickness, t is time, u is the velocity of the piston. φx=1+(Ω/h)2,φy=1−(Ω/h)2,φs=Ω/h,Ω is always in the region of 0.008mm – 0.025mm.The oil film thickness is decided by the parameters, such as: the type line of piston, the clearance between the piston and liner and the tilt angle, the geometry of the oil film thickness is shown in Fig. 1. The distribution of oil film thickness along the cycle direction can be written as:(6)h(x,θ)=R(x,θ)-rp(x,θ)+[e0+(x-ap)γ]cosθwhere R(x, θ) is the type line, e0 is the offset distance relative the mass of the piston, γ is the tilt angle of the piston, apis the distance from pin hole to top of piston skirt edge.According to the analysis ofthe piston secondary motion, the squeeze part of the Reynolds equation can be defined as:(7)∂hT‾∂t=de0dt+(x-ap)dγdtcosθCombined the Eq. (5) with Eq. (6) and Eq. (7), the new Reynolds equation to the piston-liner problem can be written as:(8)∂∂xϕxh312μ∂p∂x+∂∂yϕyh312μ∂p∂y=u2∂h∂x+u2σ∂ϕs∂x+de0dt+(x-ap)dγdtcosθThe magnitude of pressure part in Eq. (8) is 105–106 or even bigger than this, the oil film thickness is in the range of 10−4–10−5, it easy occurs the pathological in the process of solution, so the dimensionless is always used to solve this problem, the dimensionless process can be written as:x¯=x/R,y¯=y/R,et‾=et/Csω,e¯b=eb/Csωh¯=h/Cs,Ω‾=Ω/Cs,u¯=u/rω,p¯=pCs2/μrωR(9)ap‾=ap/R,b¯c=bc/R,L‾=L/Rwhere Cs=R(x,θ)−rp(x,θ), r is the radius of crankshaft, w is the angular velocity, the Reynolds equation after the dimensionless can be written as:(10)∂∂x¯Φxh¯3∂p¯∂x¯+∂∂y¯Φxh¯3∂p¯∂y¯=-6u∂h¯∂x¯-6uΩ¯∂Φs∂x¯+12RL‾r(L‾-b¯c-x¯+ap‾)det‾dt+(b¯c+x¯-ap‾)de¯bdtcosθThe boundary condition is always needed to solve the Reynolds equation, such as Newmann, Dirichlet. When the lateral moment happens, and the velocity is sure, the model above can be solved with FEM or FDM, the FEM is used in this paper and the FDM is used to validated, according to the boundary as follows, the pressure can be obtained. The boundary that solves Eq. (10) can be written as:p(0,y)=p(L,y)=0(11)∂p∂y=0y=0,πRThe FEM is a kind of method which is used to solve the partial differential equation, according to variation principle, the main theory is Ritz-Galerkin, but it overcomes some problem from the Ritz-Galerkin, Eq. (10) can be rewritten as follows based on the above theory:(12)∂∂xa(x,y)∂p∂x+∂∂yb(x,y)∂p∂y=f(x,y)wherea(x,y)=ϕxh3,b(x,y)=ϕyh3,f(x,y)=-6μu∂h∂x+Ω∂ϕs∂x+12μvq-(x-ap)dγdtcosθAfter the integration, Eq. (12) can be rewritten as:(13)∫∂∂xa(x,y)∂p∂x+∂∂yb(x,y)∂p∂yvdxdy=∫f(x,y)vdxdy(14)∫∂∂xa(x,y)∂p∂x+∂∂yb(x,y)∂p∂yvdxdy=∫∇·(λ∇p)vdxdy=-∫λ∇p·∇vdxdy+∫va∂p∂xcos(n,x)+b∂p∂ycos(n,y)dswhere∂∂xa(x,y)∂p∂x+∂∂yb(x,y)∂p∂y=∇a∂p∂xb∂p∂y=∇(λ∇p).The interpolation function is very important to this method. The finite element is shown in Fig. 2.(15)e={(x,y)|x1⩽x⩽x2,y1⩽y⩽y2}Assuming that the center of quad is (x0,y0), Fig. 2 shows that the coordinate of the P1, P2, P3, P4 is (x1, y1), (x2, y1), (x2, y2), (x1, y2), respectively. The coordinate of the center and the length of the quad can be defined as:(16)x0=12(x1+x2),y0=12(y1+y2)(17)h1=12(x1-x2),h2=12(y1-y2)After affine transformation, it transforms to the new coordinate, in ξ–η coordinate, the standard elemente={(ξ,η)|-1⩽ξ⩽1,-1⩽η⩽1},and bilinear methodu=a+bx+cy+dxyis used, so any one point in ξ–η coordinate can be defined as:(18)ξ=x-x0h1,η=y-y0h2The shape function of the finite element method can be expressed as:(19)N1=14(1-ξ)(1-η),N2=14(1+ξ)(1-η)(20)N3=14(1+ξ)(1+η),N4=14(1-ξ)(1+η)The whole region of the lubrication place can be conveyed by every element, so Eq. (13) can be defined as:(21)∑e=1∫∫(λph)·∇vhdxdy=-∑e=1f(x,y)vhdxdyThe left side of Eq. (21) is transformed to another form such as follows:(22)∑e=1Ne∫∫(λBepe)·(Beve)dxdy=∑e=1Ne∫∫peTBeTλTBevedxdy=∑e=1Ne∫∫peT(BeTλBe)vedxdy=∑e=1NepeT∫∫BeTλBedxdyve(23)Ke=∫∫BeTλBedxdywhereBe=∂Ni∂x∂Nj∂x∂Nm∂x∂Nk∂x∂Ni∂y∂Nj∂y∂Nm∂y∂Nk∂y=-(1-y-y0hy)1-y-y0hy1+y-y0hy-1+y-y0hy-1-x-x0hx-1+x-x0hx1+x-x0hx1-x-x0hxThe right side of Eq. (21) can also be transformed to another form, it is defined as:(24)-∑e=1Ne∫∫f(x,y)NeTvedxdy=∑e=1Ne-∫∫f(x,y)NeTdxdyve=∑e=1NefeTvewhereNe=141-x-xohx1-y-yohy141+x-xohx1-y-yohy141+x-xohx1+y-yohy141-x-xohx1+y-yohyThe hydrodynamic pressure p can be obtained by solving the average Reynolds equation with finite element scheme, the governing equation in the above can be transformed written as:(25)pTkV=fTvRoughness is usually much smaller than waviness for a typical piston skirt surface. The wave length is also much larger than the wave height. This means solid-to-solid elastic contact pressure (Pc), it is calculated based on the analytical solution for a blunt wedge against a plane given by Johnson [29], Zhu and coworkers given the empirical formula [22,30]. The contact pressure can be resolved starting with the following correlation:(26)δi=xi[-0.635ln(xiLw/4Ω)+1.0556]where Ω and LWis the height and the length of the wave, respectively. The mean oil film thickness h becomes smaller than the surface waviness Ω at a certain location, solid-to-solid wavy contact between the piston skirt and the cylinder bore will take place. The local wavy contact deformation can be determined by:(27)δ=Ω-hh<Ω0h⩾ΩThus, at any time t, δ is known if h is known, and the quantity can be solved from Eq. (26). The contact pressure Pc is given by:(28)Pc=xiE′LWThe lubricant oil film thickness is decided by the profile, piston motion and deformation of the piston. In this paper, the deformation of the piston and the liner are simplified as the component to the formulation R(θ,z)−r(θ,z), in order to find the effect of clearance, the variation of R(θ,z)−r(θ,z) can achieve our aim. The oil film thickness is defined as:(29)h(θ,z)=R(θ,z)-r(θ,z)+[e0+(X-f)γ]cosθThe profile design at cold state is ellipse, m′ is the long axis of the ellipse, n′ is the short axis of the ellipse, the position along the circumference can be expressed as:(30)r(θ,z)=cos2θm′2+sin2θn′2-1/2Type line is hard to be parameterized to lubrication problem for the reason that it is always hard to be written with function. In this paper, the piecewise function and interpolation function are used to solve this problem, then this component is added to Eq. (29). This function can approximately equal to the lubrication, it is written as:(31)m′=a+bX+crX(32)b=-cln(r)eX0lnra=Rmax-bX0-crX0where Rmax is the maximum radius of the skirt, r and c are the coefficient that related with curvature, Xo is the bump position of the skirt.Considering the special work condition of the piston, the piston skirt is always not a circle, parameterize the ellipticity of the piston skirt to Eq. (31), it can be written as:(33)Δ=KX+G(34)N′=m′-12Δwhere Δ is oval ratio.The mesh is very important to the analysis, numbering every element and nodes are the key to store and calculate the value of pressure, the node number is shown in Fig. 3, there are n×m nodes, (m−1)×(n−1)elements. For the element e, four nodes are numbered as clockwise 1∼2∼3∼4, and it is i∼i+m∼i+1+m∼i+1.The engine specifications of an in-line six-cylinder diesel engine are given in Table 1. The comparisons below discussed are based on these basic parameters.The dynamic motion model of piston-skirt is shown in Fig. 4. All the parameters are listed in Fig. 4 and Table 1. When the gas pressure acts on the top of the piston, the piston moves along the liner, the hydrodynamic lubrication between the piston and liner is formed, the oil film force Fh, oil film moment Mh, friction force, friction moment and so on applies on the piston. Because of different et, eband moving direction changing, the secondary motion happens and piston collides on the liner which has great relationship with the noise, friction loss and wear.When the piston moves along the liner, the displacement of the piston is written as:(35)z=(l+rp)2-cp20.5-l2-Bs2-rpcosϕwhere l is the length of the connect rod, rpis the radius of the crank-pin, cpis the distance of pin offset, Bs=cp+rpsinϕ.The velocity of the piston is shown in Fig. 5, the first derivation and derivation difference are carried out according to Eq. (40), the velocity and the acceleration of the piston along x direction can be defined as:(36)dzdt=rpwsinϕ+Bsl2-Bs2cosϕ(37)d2zdt2=rpwcosϕ+rpwBscosϕ2l2-Bs2+rpw2rpcos2ϕ-Bscosϕl2-Bs2The initial force of the piston system is shown in Fig. 6. Initial force along x direction is the nonlinear due to the cosϕ and cos2ϕ, it can be written as:(38)FIC=-(mp+mpin+msl)rpwcosϕ+(rpwBscosϕ)2l2-Bs2+rpw2(rpcos2ϕ-Bscosϕ)l2-Bs2When the cylinder pressure acts on the top of the piston, it can be simplified as the concentrated force, and it is written as:(39)Fg=pgπ4D2where Pg is the cylinder pressure, D is the diameter of the piston.Apart from the initial force along x direction, the piston also exists the initial force along y direction, the acceleration along y direction is derived from relative distance of piston skirt top edge to the center line et and relative distance of piston skirt bottom edge to the center line eb, the displacement along y direction is written as:(40)y=et+bcL(et-eb)According to Eq. (41), the velocity and acceleration along y direction can be written as:(41)v=L-bcLdet/dt+bcLdeb/dt(42)d2ydt2=d2etdt2-bcLd2etdt2-d2ebdt2The initial force along y direction is expressed as:(43)F¯IC=(mp+mpin+msl)d2etdt2-bcLd2etdt2-d2ebdt2When the piston moves along the liner, the friction forces between ring face and cylinder wall in the mixed lubrication regime result from the viscous shearing force of hydrodynamic film, the horizontal components of contact pressure between asperities and the friction between asperities. The average shear stress acting on the rough surface of piston skirt can be expressed as [31]:(44)τ=-μUh(Φf+Φfs)+Φfph2∂p∂xwhereΦf=h2Ωplnh+Ωph-Ωp,Φfs=32h2Ωplnh+Ωph-Ωp-2,Φfp=1-Ωph2,Ωpis the waving amplitude of the surface.The total hydrodynamic friction force and its moment about the wrist-pin can be calculated based on the shear stress, these forces are also the nonlinear force due to the shear part related with nonlinear component Φfand Φfs, and they can be defined as follows:(45)Ff=R∫∫τ(x,θ)dxdθ(46)Mf=R∫∫τ(x,θ)(Rcosθ-Cp)dxdθReference the paper [22,23], the oil film force or moment are all nonlinear component due to the nonlinear pressure distribution, normal force due to hydrodynamic pressure and its moment about the wrist-pin can be calculated by the following integrations:(47)Fh=R∫∫p(x,θ)cosθdxdθ(48)Mh=R∫∫p(x,θ)(ap-x)cosθdxdθWhen the piston changes the direction, the piston will tilts and the tilt angle can be defined as:(49)γ=tanγ=et-ebL(50)d2γdt2=d2etdt2-d2ebdt2/LThe rotate moment about the wrist-pin can be defined as:(51)MIC=-ICLd2etdt2-d2ebdt2As shown in Fig. 4, the equilibrium of the above explained forces and moments satisfy that:(52)Fg+FIC+Ff+FLcosφ=0(53)Fh+F‾IC+Fr+FLsinφ=0(54)Mh+MIC+F‾IC(ap-bc)+FgCp-FICCg+Mf=0Integrating Eqs. (52)–(54) together, the following governing piston dynamic motion equations can be rewritten as:(55)mp(L-bc)/Lmpbc/LIp/L-Ip/Lce¨te¨b=Fh+Fr-(Fg+FIc+Ff)tanφMh+F‾Ic(ap-bc)+FgCp-FICCg-MfSecondary motion of the piston is nonlinear and stiff ordinary differential equations due to the nonlinear force in the above. In this study, the Runge–Kutta is used to solve the piston dynamics motion equations. To gain better efficiency, the modified extended backward differentiation formula is discussed. To achieve better convergence condition, the intake stage is set as the start crank angle.Assuming that there is no oscillating when the piston moves from one side to the other side, det/dt=0, deb/dt=0. The surface of piston skirt fit to the piston liner, the displacement etand ebare the biggest thermal state clearances. So the initial values are set as following:(56)et(t=0)eb(t=0)=-δh-δh(57)detdt(t=0)debdt(t=0)=00If it is not satisfied with a reasonable tolerance, the present solution of et, and ebfor the current time step will be adjusted and the procedure will be repeated. The piston position at the end of the current time step can be determined by(58)det(t)/dt=det(t+T)/dtdeb(t)/dt=deb(t+T)/dtet(t)=et(t+T)eb(t)=eb(t+T)The high order variables need to change to the first order, et, eb, det/dt, deb/dt, d2et/dt2, d2eb/dt2 can be rewritten as:(59)y1=et,y2=det/dt=f1,y2′=d2et/dt2=f2,y3=eb,y4=deb/dt=f3,y3′=d2eb/dt2=f4According to the general n step Runge–Kutta, the first order ordinary differential equation (ODE) can be solved using the following form:(60)yi,n+1=yi,n+t6ki1+2ki2+2ki3+ki4,(i=1,2,3,4)ki1=fi(tn,y1n,y2n,y3n,y4n)ki2=fitn+t2,y1n+t2k11,y2n+t2k21,y3n+t2k31,y4n+t2k41ki3=fitn+t2,y1n+t2k12,y2n+t2k22,y3n+t2k32,y4n+t2k42ki4=fitn+t,y1n+tk13,y2n+tk23,y3n+tk33,y4n+tk43where t is time step.The piston skirt lubrication is a very complex problem, it contains many factors that affect the lubrication, it can be concluded that: clearance, offset of piston pin, bump position, and length of the piston skirt, ellipicity of the piston and profile curvature. Fig. 7presents the oil film thickness distribution at the 0°CA and the oil film pressure distribution at 180°CA, 300°CA, 360°CA are calculated according to the parameters in the Table 1, we can clearly clarify that Fh and Mh are the nonlinear for the nonlinear pressure distribution. The oil film thickness appears the below distribution because of oval piston and profile. To validate the model, the whole system is also solved by the FDM (solving the lubrication) coupled with Runge–Kutta (solving the secondary motion), the minimum oil film thickness is compared (as shown in Fig. 7b), the result shows that MOFT calculated with these two method agrees well. When the crank angle is 180°CA, both TS and ATS side appear the oil film pressure (C, D as shown in Fig. 7d), the reason for that is both sides appear hydrodynamic lubrication due to the direction changing, the load compacting regions clearly appear at the top side and bottom side of TS and ATS, respectively, which also proofs that the piston is changing direction. The piston skirt runs against the ATS side when it is at 300°CA, the hydrodynamic lubrication is formed and the oil film pressure only appears at this side. The piston locates in the TDC which endures higher cylinder pressure, however, the oil film pressure is not high due to the zero velocity, and the MOFT start to increase when the piston fitting surface start change from ATS to TS, the piston are close to the TS side for the position of the mass centre (as shown in Fig. 7f). Both TS side and ATS side appear the hydrodynamic lubrication which also proofs the changing direction but tilt angle is very small.The clearance is the main contribution to the oil film thickness, suitable clearance not only reduces the noise but also increases the load capacity, and the paper [32] advised that the clearance is usually 0.03mm – 0.04mm. The clearance also has great effect on the noise, and it has been investigated by the earlier researcher [20,33]. In fact, it is hard to sure the values of the clearance, which can avoid piston stuck in the liner and improve the noise. The reason for this difficulty is that installation and manufacture error of piston and liner, and the thermal deformation of the piston and liner is difficult to obtain precisely. In this paper, the piston profiles for different clearances are shown in Fig. 8.This paper mainly focuses on the effect of the structural parameters on the slap noise, and the slap energy of the piston on the liner contains lateral motion energy and rotational motion energy, it is defined as:(61)E=12mv2+12Jγ̇2where E is the secondary motion energy, v is the lateral velocity,γ̇is the rotational velocity, J is the moment of inertia reference the piston pin.The slap noise usually occurs at the vicinity of the top dead center (TDC), so we mainly focus on the characteristics near this time. Fig. 9presents the dynamic characteristics of the piston under different clearances. The results show that the piston changes direction at 360°CA, the maximum displacement is 0.0068mm, 0.0047mm, 0.0036mm when the clearance is 62.95mm, 62.97mm and 62.98mm, respectively. They all appear at 432.5°CA. The larger clearance will increase the lateral displacement (et, eb). However, the main reason that causes the slap noise is lateral velocity (it decides the energy of the piston in fact, the slap force can also be written as F=mpistonv/Δt), when the lateral velocity increase, the slap noise will also increase. The result shows that the maximum value ofėtis 0.068m/s, 0.037m/s, 0.024m/s when the clearance is 62.95mm, 62.97mm and 62.98mm, respectively. The increasing of clearance will increase the lateral velocityėt(as shown in Fig. 9c), they occur at 373.1°CA, 377.4°CA, 381.3°CA, respectively. Combining with the lateral displacement direction of et, the top edge is moving far away from TS, so it has little effect on the slap noise. Compared with the displacement et, the lateral displacement ebinclines to TS side and it also increases with the clearance, the maximum velocity along TS is −0.05m/s, −0.031m/s, −0.021m/s which appears at 371.2°CA, 375.4°CA, 380.4°CA, respectively, Δt for the different clearance can be ranged as: ΔtCs=62.95<ΔtCs=62.97<ΔtCs=62.98. The slap force caused by clearance can be ranged as: FCs=62.95>FCs=62.97>FCs=62.98, so the slap force caused by the lateral component increases with clearances. The reason for this result is that load capacity of the oil film increases with the drop of the clearance, the smaller clearance causes the clearance between the piston skirt and liner to be uniform, and larger oil film force prevents the piston colliding to the liner, that is also why decreasing the clearance will intensify the wear. Apart from the energy coming from lateral velocity, another energy component comes from the rotation (E=1/2Jw2), so the rotational velocity are compared (as shown in Fig. 9f), the result shows that clearance increasing increases the rotational velocityγ̇,the momentum of the piston is L=Iw/Δt, the maximum rotational velocityγ̇of different clearance can be ranged: wCs=62.95>wCs=62.97>wCs=62.98 and Δt is 13.5°CA,18.1°CA and 22.3°CA for the clearance is 62.95mm, 62.97mm and 62.98mm, respectively. The reason for this is that a moment will produce due to ap=38.9mm<X0=56.85mm, this moment will be larger when the clearance reduces due to higher load capacity, this moment will prevent the piston rotating around the pin.To reduce the slap noise, the piston pin always offset to TS side, the amplitude is always 0–2mm, however, to reduce wear and friction loss, the piston pin always offsets to ATS side, the slap noise and the wear of the piston is a trade-off problem about the offset of the piston pin. So a suitable offset of the piston pin is very important to the piston system, especially for the diesel engine. Fig. 10presents two kind modes of pin offset, and we can know the effect of offsets on the slap noise and friction by the force analysis acting on the liner. However, when the offset exists in practice design of the piston, it not only has great the effect on the dynamic motion, but also it relates with load equilibrium.Fig. 11presents the dynamic characteristics under different pin offset distances. The offset distance inclines to ATS when Cp is minus, and the offset distance inclines to TS when Cp is positive. In fact, the thrust force F=(Fg+FIC)tanβ will increase for the reason that β>β′ at the explosion stage and β<β′ at the compression stage (as shown in Fig. 10a).The results show that the maximum lateral velocity of top edge (ėt) is 0.009m/s, 0.06m/s, 0.037m/s when Cp=1mm, Cp=−1mm and Cp=0mm, which appears at 373.2°CA, 368.5°CA, 377.4°CA, respectively. et,ėtincreases clearly when the offset inclines to TS. Δt can be ranged as: ΔtCp=1<ΔtCp=0<ΔtCp=−1, the reason is that the moment M produced by the gas pressure will increase the amplitude of the tilt. The moment M will forbid the piston to rotate when the offset inclines to ATS side, that is why the lateral displacement etis smaller compared with Cp=−1mm, however, it will increase the occurrence of the wear at the top of the piston (A1, A2 position in Fig. 10b). Compared withėt,ėbappears the opposite trend, and the maximum lateral velocity of bottom edgeėbis 0.007m/s, −0.055m/s and −0.031m/s when Cp=1mm, Cp=−1mm and Cp=0mm, and they appear at 377.5°CA, 389.5°CA and 375.7°CA, respectively. Δt can be ranged as: ΔtCp=0(15.7°CA)<ΔtCp=1(17.5°CA)<ΔtCp=−1(29.5°CA). The reason for this phenomenon is that crank pin rotates along clockwise direction(A→E→F→B→C as shown in Fig. 10b), B is the position of the crank pin for TDC, A→B is the period of the compression stroke, the piston fit to the ATS when crank pin is at A position, the crank pin rotates to E position, the connecting rod is parallel to the liner, there is no thrust force, the bottom edge of the piston inclines to ATS and top edge of the piston inclines to TS due to the moment M and the gravity force, this trend increases with amplitude of the offset. This kind of piston tilt causes the instantaneous reversing process to change to the step transition. That is why the slap noise can be reduced through inclining pin to TS. Next, the analysis for the rotational velocity is also carried out (as shown in Fig. 10e and f), when the offset inclines to TS, the moment M and the larger F=(Fg+FIC)tanβ accelerates the tilt process and cause the piston to wear seriously, the tilt angle achieving the maximum value will be also earlier, the thinner oil film thickness also leads to the lateral displacement et and tilt angle to be larger. Another interesting phenomenon is the gradient of the rotational velocity is smaller which alleviates the slap force, and the reason for this is that larger oil film force will produce larger moment due to load capacity increasing, and it forbids the piston to rotate.The maximum oil film pressure usually distributes near the bump position because of smaller oil film thickness, the position of the bump can also change the oil film thickness distribution. The research shows that bump position always locates at the middle of skirt, it satisfies the force and moment balance, and it is good for the hydrodynamic lubrication. The bump position also decides the position of pin hole. Fig. 12presents the skirt profile of the piston with different bump positions.Fig. 13presents the dynamic characteristics of the piston under different bump positions, the results show that theėt,ėbandγ̇clearly decreases with the drop of the bump position H, the energy acts on the liner will be small, it can reduce the slap noise clearly. When the bump position H>ap, the moment produced Mhby the oil film will cause the piston to rotate shown as arrow in Fig. 12b, so the moment intensifies the rotational amplitude (as shown the region of B in Fig. 13e), this value increases with value of H-apdue to larger moment, the lateral displacement etalso increases due to the increasing rotational angle (the region of A, as shown in Fig. 13a), the piston fits to the TS of the liner well when X0=40mm, the oil film force Fhand thrust force Fs are nearly in the same line, so the oil film does not need to reform to achieve the balance. However, the oil film needs to reform to achieve the balance when the oil film X0 increases, and it leads to MOFT decrease and easily wear. When the thrust force acts on TS because of direction changing, the piston starts to rotate, and the piston needs to rotate a larger angle to achieve the balance when the bump position moves along to the bottom of the edge due to mainly hydrodynamic lubrication occurring near the bump position, the piston accelerates until it achieves the balance, the acceleration is clearly larger due to the oil film does not form or hydrodynamic lubrication is weak, and the resistance produced by the oil film is smaller, this process also causes angular velocity to be larger. So the slap noise can be reduced when the X0 moves along the bottom edge, however, it does not mean that the bump position locating nearly at the top of the skirt edge is best, in fact, if X0 is too small, it is also bad to the lubrication, so suitable bump position is very important.In the tradition design, the length of piston skirt is designed according to the guidance and the compact pressure ratio, and the compact pressure ratio reflects the average oil film pressure, however, it does not mean that the longer of the piston skirt is the better. Fig. 14 presents the piston profile of piston skirt with different skirt lengths, the profile are nearly the same, the main difference is the length from the bump position to the bottom edge of the piston, when the piston tilt in the liner system, the minimum oil film thickness of some parts decreases (h2<h1) and the lateral displacement locates at the bottom is bigger than the shorter length. In practice design, the compact pressure ratio drops due to the area increasing, although the frictional area is larger, the smaller shear force dominates the main area, and the power loss caused by the friction will decrease if the wear is not seriously, however, the occurrence of wear locating at H region is higher for the same tilt angle (as shown in Fig. 14a).Fig. 15 presents the dynamic characteristics under different piston skirt lengths. When the length of the skirt increases, the load compacting area increases, and it leads to the mean oil film pressure decrease(Fh/(0.5πD)), it causes the lateral velocity of the top edge to drop and the lateral velocity of the bottom edge to increase, but the increasing amplitude is very small, and the result shows that when the skirt length increases, the concentration of oil film force will move toward to the bottom of the piston, the oil film force Fhproducing the moment Mhwill be larger, however, this moment will aggravate the rotation amplitude (J as shown in Fig. 15b), but its action is very weak due to main hydrodynamic lubrication happen at the region from the bump position to the top edge of the piston, the reason is that the oil film extrusion mainly happens at this region. Apart from the energy coming from lateral velocity, comparison about rotational energy is shown in Fig. 15f, the oil film force Fhproduces the moment Mhwill be larger if the skirt length increases, it will prevent the piston from rotating, that is why the rotational velocity drops with the increasing of skirt length. However, when the connecting rod force Fs acts on the liner, the oil film distribution needs to reform to balance the force Fs, and it causes the piston to tilt as shown in Fig. 15e.In fact, when the length of the piston skirt increases to some extent, the noise improvement by the skirt is very limited, however, the mass of the piston will increase due to the length increasing, which will contribute more to the energy, so a suitable skirt length is very important. The effect of skirt length on the slap noise is very complex problem, and an insight work about the mechanism of skirt length on the slap noise will be carried in future workWhen the piston endures the heat, the deformation along pin seat is bigger than other places of the skirt, To avoid sucking caused by the piston heat expand, the piston skirt of the skirt is designed with ellipticity, the short axis of the oval exists along the pin seat direction, TS and ATS are the main load compacting region, when the piston bears the heat load. Bigger clearance along pin seat direction will decrease due to the thermal deformation, and it is suit for the lubrication, so the suitable ellipiticity can reduce the friction loss. Fig. 16a presents the different ellipticity modes of the piston skirt, Δ1and Δ2 are the clearance of the piston-liner system at different positions, n1 and n2 are the short axis, when the short axis changes, it means that the curvature along circumference is different, Fig. 16b presents the oil film bearing when the piston tilts.Fig. 17presents the dynamic characteristics under different piston ovals. The results show that ellipticity of the piston has little effect on the et,ėt,eb,ėb,γandγ̇,when the parameter G increases (Larger G represents that the ellipticity of the piston increases), the lateral velocity and rotational velocity decreases to some extent when the ellipticity of the piston increases, the kinetic energy will increase, but it is very limited to change the slap noise by improve the piston oval, the friction loss also increases due to the increasing load compacting area. The main reason is that ellipticity of the piston changes the oil film pressure distribution and load capacity, and the larger ellipticity of the piston causes the pressure to concentrate on a small place, but smaller ellipticity of the piston leads to the clearance between the piston skirt and liner to be uniform, and the MOFT calculated by different ovals can be ranged as: MOFTG=0.384<MOFTG=0.284<MOFTG=0.184, Larger area of oil film compacting region also avoids the piston slapping on the liner directly, and the lateral and rotational motion are also weaken due to the larger oil film thickness. However, it increases the occurrence of the asperity contact.If∂h/∂x=0in the piston lubrication, the hydrodynamic lubrication only depends on extrusion of the oil film, it is bad to the lubrication. The earliest skirt profile of the piston is straight line, and to make the ∂h/∂x≠0,the piston needs to tilt to achieve this aim. This kind of skirt design will cause the top edge and bottom of the skirt to wear seriously, and the slap noise is higher. To achieve the aim ∂h/∂x≠0,the skirt profile is designed as the curved line, however, the higher curvature value may lead to the oil film concentrate on a too small place, which will lead the mixed lubrication in the lubrication, it also increases the friction loss significantly, but the value of the curvature is hard to define in practice engineering. To obtain the mechanism of curvature parameters on the slap noise, different curvature values csof the piston skirt profiles are compared (as shown in Fig. 18).When the piston moves from TDC, a minus pressure zone appears at the back of the piston skirt (as shown A position in Fig. 18b, it is also the cavitation zone, and it always appears at the oil outlet of the lubrication), this part of the piston does not bear the load, in fact, this area is wasting, this area increases with curvature parameter increasing, it also leads to the force produced by the oil film concentrate on a smaller place. However, the curvature parameter should not be too small, which will decrease the load capacity of the oil film. Fig. 19 presents the dynamic characteristics under different curvature parameters. The results show that lateral displacement and lateral velocity decrease with curvature parameter increasing, according to F=mpistonv/Δt, the main lateral velocityėbthat causes the slap noise to increase with the curvature drop, Δt are nearly the same, so the slap force produced by lateral motion can be ranged as: Fcs=−0.8<Fcs=−1.0<Fcs=−1.2, another energy component comes from the rotation, the rotation velocity can be ranged as: wcs=−0.8<wcs=−1.0<wcs=−1.2 (as shown in Fig. 19f), so the slap noise can be improved by suitable curvature. The reason for this phenomenon is that the back place of the smaller curvatures (profile above the bump) leads to the oil film distribute uniform, the oil film load capacity and bearing zone (B position as shown in Fig. 18b) will also increase because of decreasing of minus pressure zone (cavitations zone) and the uniform oil film thickness distribution, main hydrodynamic lubrication occurs at the place that above the bump position when the piston move toward the cylinder head at the compression stroke, and the smaller curvature causes the Fh to move toward the head, so Mh will be smaller which also causes the tilt angle to be smaller (K as shown in Fig. 19e). However, main hydrodynamic lubrication occurs at the place that under the bump position when the piston move toward the crank train at the explosion stroke, Fh will concentrates lower than before, which causes larger Mh to forbid the piston collide on the liner. The piston rotates reference the bump point C and fits to the liner, but the hydrodynamic lubrication will intensify under the bump position due to higher hydrodynamic lubrication, it forbids the piston to rotate with larger amplitude.
