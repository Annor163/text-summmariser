@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Visual secret sharing (VSS) is a variant form of secret sharing, and is efficient since secret decoding only depends on the human vision system. However, cheating in VSS, first showed by Horng et al., is a significant issue like a limelight. Since then, plenty of studies for cheating activities and cheating prevention visual secret sharing (CPVSS) schemes have been introduced. In this paper, we revisit some well-known cheating activities and CPVSS schemes, and then categorize cheating activities into meaningful cheating, non-meaningful cheating, and meaningful deterministic cheating. Moreover, we analyze the research challenges in CPVSS, and propose a new cheating prevention scheme which is better than the previous schemes in the aspects of some security requirements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Visual secret sharing (VSS) is inspired from secret sharing [1]. A secret is converted to a secret image (SI), and then SI will be encoded into many shares. Shares, given to participants by the dealer (a trusted party,D), are formed into transparencies in VSS.Xis an authorized subset, and the participants inXcan visually reconstruct the secret image by stacking their transparencies together without performing any complicated cryptographic computation. In the k-out-of-n visual secret sharing (for short,(k,n)-VSS), there are n participants, while any k participants inXare able to reconstruct the secret by stacking their transparencies. Overall, a VSS scheme usually consists of three phases: (1) encoding, (2) distributing, (3) decoding. Encoding is performed by the dealer to generate all transparencies, thenDdistributes those transparencies to participants. Finally, the participants inXcan decode the secret image by stacking their transparencies.In particular, a special and important property to differ VSS from secret sharing [2] is that the security of VSS is achieved by loosing the contrast and the resolution of the SI. Indeed, the quality of the reconstructed secret image is inferior to the original secret image, but the secret is still seen by humanʼs vision. With the development of VSS, many applications and related techniques have been proposed, such as visual authentication, visual identification, and image encryption. In addition, many kinds of VSS schemes were proposed to be used in different scenarios or to achieve different requirements [3–10].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The cheating problem is a significant issue in secret sharing. Horng et al. showed cheating is also possible in visual secret sharing. Recently, quite a few studies have been proposed for cheating activities in VSS and cheating prevention schemes. In this paper, we analyze the well-known cheating activities and some CPVSS schemes, and then redefine the meaningful cheating, the non-meaningful cheating and meaningful deterministic cheating. Additionally, we propose a cheating prevention visual secret sharing scheme, and prove that it is secure against the meaningful deterministic cheating. The proposed scheme is better than the previous schemes in the expansion of a pixel. It does not rely on the added transparencies.
