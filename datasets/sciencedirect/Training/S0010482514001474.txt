@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Obstructive lung diseases in the lower airways are a leading health concern worldwide. To improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of lower airways, we studied airflow characteristics in the lung between the 8th and the 14th generations using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model, where we compared normal and obstructed airways for a range of breathing conditions. We employed a novel technique based on computing the Pearson×³s correlation coefficient to quantitatively characterize the differences in airflow patterns between the normal and obstructed airways. We found that the airflow patterns demonstrated clear differences between normal and diseased conditions for high expiratory flow rates (>2300ml/s), but not for inspiratory flow rates. Moreover, airflow patterns subjected to filtering demonstrated higher sensitivity than airway resistance for differentiating normal and diseased conditions. Further, we showed that wall shear stresses were not only dependent on breathing rates, but also on the distribution of the obstructed sites in the lung: for the same degree of obstruction and breathing rate, we observed as much as two-fold differences in shear stresses. In contrast to previous studies that suggest increased wall shear stress due to obstructions as a possible damage mechanism for small airways, our model demonstrated that for flow rates corresponding to heavy activities, the wall shear stress in both normal and obstructed airways was <0.3Pa, which is within the physiological limit needed to promote respiratory defense mechanisms. In summary, our model enables the study of airflow characteristics that may be impractical to assess experimentally.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Obstructive lung diseases are one of the most common and life-threatening conditions, causing high morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries [1]. Many lung diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are characterized by the obstruction of airflow in the lungs. According to the World Health Organization, COPD is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and is estimated to become the third leading cause by 2030 [1]. The dominant cause of such obstructive lung diseases is exposure to lung irritants, resulting in the contraction of smooth muscle in airway walls and inflammation, which in turn lead to narrowing of the airway lumen [2].The development of chronic disease conditions associated with airway obstruction may be altered by proper and timely intervention [3]. Thus, early detection and correct diagnosis are critical. However, some airway conditions remain hard to diagnose, especially those pertaining to the lower airways [4]. For example, significant discordance has been reported between commonly used references for the interpretation of spirometry data [5], and the American Thoracic Society does not recommend the use of spirometric parameters, such as the mid-expiratory flow, to detect lower airway disease [6]. According to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), undiagnosed airflow obstruction (12%) is more common than diagnosed COPD (3.1%) or asthma (2.7%) in the United States (U.S.) and is associated with impaired health and functional status [4]. Undiagnosed pulmonary conditions have also been reported in U.S. military populations [7]. Out of 105 active duty military patients who complained of exertional dyspnea, one quarter (25 patients) had no specific diagnosis even after a comprehensive standard evaluation [7].Understanding the airflow characteristics in the lower airways of the lungs could provide detailed insights on respiratory physiology and pathophysiology and be potentially useful for diagnosis of lower airway diseases. However, due to limitations in spatial and temporal resolutions, it is difficult to study local airflow characteristics in the lower airways using experimental techniques. For example, a pulmonary function test (PFT) involves measuring the volume of airflow during forced expiration at the mouth and comparing it with standardized normal values for diagnosis. However, because PFT measures airflow in the bulk phase, it is insensitive to regional differences in airflow patterns, especially in the lower airways. Similarly, although hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance imaging can provide static and dynamic ventilation maps of the lungs [8], it is still not possible to obtain details of airflow characteristics, such as velocity contours, in the lower airways [9].Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides the means to investigate, in detail and under controlled conditions, airflow characteristics in three-dimensional (3-D) models of the respiratory system. Previous CFD modeling efforts in pulmonary health have focused mainly on (1) establishing particle dosimetry in normal airways to optimize inhaled drug delivery and understand risks due to airborne pollutants [10,11], (2) understanding sleep apnea associated with obstructions in extrathoracic airways [12,13], and (3) investigating airway obstructions in the upper generations of the lungs [14,15]. In contrast, we focus on exploring airflow characteristics in the lower airways under different breathing conditions and examining influences of lower-airway obstructions as compared with normal conditions. Moreover, we aim to characterize airflow during both the inhalation and exhalation phases of respiration, as opposed to previous studies which have mostly investigated the inhalation phase [16,17]. Specifically, we developed CFD models of normal and obstructed airways between the 8th and the 14th generations with different obstruction patterns. We then compared the airflow patterns and flow-induced wall shear stresses for different flow conditions. Our results quantify differences in airflow characteristics due to obstructions commonly associated with lower airway lung diseases for both phases of respiration.
