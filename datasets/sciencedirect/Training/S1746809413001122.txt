@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is generally used in brain–computer interface (BCI), including motor imagery, mental task, steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) and P300. In order to complement existing motor-based control paradigms, this paper proposed a novel imagery mode: speech imagery. Chinese characters are monosyllabic and one Chinese character can express one meaning. Thus, eight Chinese subjects were required to read two Chinese characters in mind in this experiment. There were different shapes, pronunciations and meanings between two Chinese characters. Feature vectors of EEG signals were extracted by common spatial patterns (CSP), and then these vectors were classified by support vector machine (SVM). The accuracy between two characters was not superior. However, it was still effective to distinguish whether subjects were reading one character in mind, and the accuracies were between 73.65% and 95.76%. The results were better than vowel speech imagery, and they were suitable for asynchronous BCI. BCI systems will be also extended from motor imagery to combine motor imagery and speech imagery in the future.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Brain–computer interface (BCI) research is advancing very rapidly. It provides a new non-muscular channel for patients with motor dysfunction [1], such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury, to exchange information with the external world. As it directly provides a new information exchange and control path for the users, which bypasses the peripheral nerve and muscle tissue, the quality of users’ life can be improved greatly. BCI research has been arisen around the world over the past 25 years with decreasing the cost of electronic equipment, especially that the technology based on classifying single trial electroencephalography (EEG) has been attracted enough attention by researchers. There are some potential applications of BCI, for example, movement within virtual reality environments, computer cursors and virtual keyboards operation for disabled person.Several BCI methods have been developed, such as EEG [2], magnetoencephalography (MEG) [3], electrocorticography (ECoG) [4], functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [5], and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) [6]. As EEG is a non-invasive technology and it is much cheaper than others, the BCI systems based on EEG have been studied widely. EEG signals can be varied by several brain activities, e.g. event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) [7], mental task [8], steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs) [9], and P300 evoked potentials [10]. ERD/ERS of sensory-motor rhythms are found during overt motor execution and motor imagery. To the best of our knowledge, the motor imagery-based BCI provides high classification accuracy, but its maximum number of categories is only four [11]. It is not very convenient to use SSEPs and P300 BCIs, as they depend on additional equipment to produce stimuli. Furthermore, users may feel fatigue after using long time.For the above reasons, a novel speech imagery BCI system is proposed. Eric C Leuthardt had used ECoG speech network to control a BCI [12], and DaSalla proposed /a/ and /u/ as vowel speech imageries for EEG-based BCI [13]. In this paper, it is the first time to analyze and classify EEG signals from characters speech imagery. These characters had specific meaning. Chinese characters are monosyllabic, and one Chinese character can express one meaning. For example, “左” is pronounced as “zuo” in third tone, and it means left in English; “壹” is pronounced as “yi” in first tone, and it means one in English. As “左(left)” and “壹(one)” have different pronunciations, shapes and meanings and they are very commonly used in daily life, they are selected as the characters of speech imagery. We tried to use common spatial patterns (CSP) and support vector machine (SVM) to separate EEG signals when subjects were reading Chinese characters in mind.
