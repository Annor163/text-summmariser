@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Jitter is a phenomenon caused by the perturbation in the length of the glottal cycles due to the quasi-periodic oscillation of the vocal folds in the production of the voice. It can be modeled as a random phenomenon described by the deviations of the glottal cycle length in relation to a mean value. Its study has been developed due to important applications such as aid in identification of voices with pathological characteristics, when its values are large, because a normal voice has naturally a low level of jitter. The aim of this paper is to construct a stochastic model of jitter using a two-mass mechanical model of the vocal folds, assuming complete right–left symmetry of the vocal folds and considering the motion of the vocal folds only in the horizontal direction. The stiffnesses taken into account in the model are considered as stochastic processes and their modeling are proposed. Glottal signals and voice signals are generated with jitter and the probability density function of the fundamental frequency is constructed for several values of the hyperparameters that control the level of jitter.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The voice production process, in particular in voiced speech production, where vowels are included, is due to the oscillation of the vocal folds, which modulates the airflow coming from the lungs, and the air pulses then generated (called the glottal signal) will be filtered and amplified by the vocal tract and, further, radiated by the mouth.However, the glottal signal is not exactly periodic. The (small) fluctuation in each glottal cycle length is called jitter and its study is justified because it can be used for measuring the voice quality and indicating the presence of pathologies related to the voice or even helping the speech recognition [1–4].Voice pathology can cause increased noise components in the voice signal such as: fundamental frequency and amplitude irregularities and variations with different patterns, sub-harmonic frequency components, turbulent noise, voice breaks and tremors [5–8].To help pre-diagnosis of pathologies related to the voice, in general, it is necessary to extract not only jitter from the voice signal, but also other measures, like shimmer and HNR (harmonic-noise ration). A large level of jitter can indicate a possibility of a pathology, but to help the identification of the type of pathology, in general, it is not enough. Some authors have discussed this point and proposed strategies to use jitter and other measures to classify pathologies related to the voice [9–14].Some motivations for developing models of jitter include the discussion about the mechanisms that may cause the movements of the vocal folds to be non periodic. In addition, models of jitter may help to improve naturalness or mimic hoarse voices when synthesizers are used, for example.Some researchers have developed models to produce voice and even voice with pathological characteristics [15–18]. Erath et al. [19] made a good review of models used to produce voice, including mechanical models and pathological phonation. Deguchi and Kawahara [20] present a continuum-based numerical model of phonation to simulate human phonation with vocal nodules. Deguchi and Kawahara [20] have simulate human phonation with vocal nodules. Fraile et al. [21] simulate vocal tremor using a high-dimensional discrete vocal fold model. However, all of these models are deterministic.The objective of this paper is to construct a stochastic model of the vocal folds in order to generate jitter. The underlying deterministic model used is the one introduced by Ishizaka and Flanagan model [16]. Previous works have discussed stochastic mechanical models to produce voice [22,23] considering some parameters modeled as random variables, prior probability distributions have been constructed and then updated.The approach used here is different and consists in modeling the stiffnesses as stochastic processes. A system of nonlinear stochastic differential equation is then solved and the voiced signals are synthesized for different levels of jitter.The underlying deterministic model used is the nonlinear two-mass model proposed by Ishizaka and Flanagan composed by two subsystems: the subsystem of the vocal folds (source) and the subsystem of the vocal tract (filter). The two subsystems are coupled by the glottal flow. The vocal tract is represented by a standard configuration of concatenated tubes [24,25].The complete model considered here presents some modifications in relation to the original Ishizaka and Flanagan model [26,27,22]. The system of differential equations to be solved, and which is detailed in Appendix A, can be divided in three parts (see Fig. 1that illustrates a sketch of the model):•A nonlinear integro-differential equation for the glottal flow that is coupled with the vocal tract, called the coupling equation (see Eqs. (A.1)–(A.9)). It is a scalar nonlinear integro-differential equation whose unknown time-dependent function is the real-valued function t↦ug(t) that models the acoustic volume velocity through the glottis. This equation depends on the real-valued function t↦u1(t) that is related to the first tube of the sound acoustic propagation into the vocal tract.A system of linear integro-differential equations related to the sound acoustic propagation through the vocal tract and called the sound acoustic propagation equation (see Eq. (A.10)). It is constituted of n+1 scalar linear integro-differential equations for which the n+1 unknown time-dependent functions are the real-valued functions t↦u1(t), …, un(t), uR(t). The function t↦pr(t) is the sound acoustic pressure through the mouth.A system of nonlinear differential equations related to the dynamics of the vocal folds and called the vocal folds dynamic equation (see Eq. (A.11)). It is a system of nonlinear differential equations whose unknown time-dependent functions are the real-valued functions t↦x1(t) that is the displacement of the mass 1 and x2(t) is the displacement of the mass 2, corresponding together to the vocal folds. For all t, x1(t) and x2(t) are generated by the vocal folds dynamic equations. The solutions x1 and x2 of such equations are constructed for all t and are used as follows:–The collision of the vocal folds starts at a time t1 when x1(t) reaches a given critical value x01 (defined in Appendix A). This process continues, and at a time t2, x2(t) reaches a given critical value x02. At this time, the two parts of the model corresponding to the vocal folds are in collision. Then, at a third time t3, the upper part of the vocal folds leaves the contact, but the mass lower part continues in contact (mass m2). Finally, at a time t4, the lower part leaves the collision.While the glottis is closed (during time t1 up to t4), ugand dug/dt remain zero, ug(τ)=dug(τ)/dτ=0, the stiffnesses and the dampings of the models are modified in the vocal folds dynamic equation, but the propagation of sound goes on in the vocal tract.The jitter phenomenon has been studied for many researchers in order to be used as a measure for discriminating voices with pathological characteristics or even aging voice characteristics. Since the second middle of the eighties, the research about jitter has become less clinical and more methodological. The methods used to measure jitter, and other characteristics of the voice signal, changed considerably, and one of the first works for quantifying the jitter was proposed by Lieberman [25]. Other preliminary works were based on the calculations of a typical value related to the differences between the lengths of the cycles and their mean values. In general, the works agree with the fact that typical values of the jitter are between 0.1% and 1% of the fundamental period, for the so-called normal voices (that is, without the presence of pathologies). Some works discussing jitter and its application [28–31,13]. In general, the authors who work with models of jitter (or the variations of the fundamental frequency) do not introduce mathematical models for the voice production. Only a few authors consider stochastic models [32,33,22,23].As the objective of the stochastic model is to enrich the deterministic model of the voice production, and since we are interested in constructing a stochastic perturbation (the jitter effect) of the periodic solution that is produced when the stiffnesses k1, k2, and kcare constant, it is coherent to introduce a stochastic modeling of these stiffnesses in replacing them by stochastic quantities K1(t), K2(t), and Kc(t). We thus introduce the stationary stochastic processes{K1(t),t∈ℝ},{K2(t),t∈ℝ}, and{Kc(t),t∈ℝ}, with values inℝ+, which models the stiffnesses k1, k2 and kcof the deterministic model. Consequently, the deterministic equations (that are detailed in Appendix A) for the deterministic time functions ug(t), u1(t), …, un(t), uR(t), x1(t), and x2(t), become stochastic equations for the stochastic processes denoted by Ug(t), U1(t), …, Un(t), UR(t), X1(t), and X2(t). The corresponding stochastic equations are detailed in Appendix B.For all fixed t, the real-valued random variables K1(t), K2(t), and Kc(t) must be positive as explained above. Nevertheless, this property is not sufficient for ensuring the coherence of the construction of the stochastic model of the stochastic stiffnesses. It is necessary to write that, for all fixed t, the random matrix [K(t)] defined by(1)K11(t)K12(t)K21(t)K22(t)in which(2)K11(t)=K1(t)+Kc(t),(3)K22(t)=K2(t)+Kc(t),(4)K12(t)=K21(t)=−Kc(t),is a random matrix with values in the setM2+(ℝ)of all the positive-definite real (2×2) matrices. Consequently, the construction of the stochastic model of stiffnesses consists in constructing a stochastic process {[K(t)],t∈ℝ}with values inM2+(ℝ), which can then be not Gaussian (due to the positivity property). It can then be deduced the stochastic model of the dependent non-Gaussian stochastic processes{K1(t),t∈ℝ},{K2(t),t∈ℝ}, and{Kc(t),t∈ℝ}, which are such that, for all fixed t,(5)Kc(t)=−K12(t),(6)K1(t)=K11(t)−Kc(t),(7)K2(t)=K22(t)−Kc(t).In the framework of the jitter effects, matrix-valued stochastic process{[K(t)],t∈ℝ}is chosen as a stationary stochastic process that must be of second-order for physical reason. In order to ensure the positivity property, for all t fixed inℝ, random matrix [K(t)] is written as(8)[K(t)]=[L_K]T[G(t)][L_K],in which [G(t)] is a random matrix with values inM2+(ℝ)such that its mean values E{[G(t)]}=[I2] is the identity matrix. In Eq. (8),[L_K]is an upper triangular real (2×2) matrix such that the mean value[K_]=E{[K(t)]}∈M2+(ℝ)of the random matrix [K(t)] is written as(9)[K_]=[L_K]T[L_K],which is the Cholesky decomposition of the positive-definite real matrix[K_]. As explained in [34], for all t inℝ, the random matrix [G(t)] must be written as(10)[G(t)]=11+ϵ([G0(t)]+ϵ[I2]),in which ϵ>0 is a given regularization parameter and where{[G0(t)],t∈ℝ}is a second-order stationary stochastic process with values inM2+(ℝ)such that(11)E{[G0(t)]}=[I2].The stochastic model is constructed as explained in [35,36]. For all fixed t, random matrix [G0(t)] is written as(12)[G0(t)]=[L0(t)]T[L0(t)],in which [L0(t)] is a random upper triangular matrix whose diagonal entries are positive-valued random variable,(13)[L0(t)]=L0(t)11L0(t)120L0(t)22.For j=1, 2, the positive-valued random variable L0(t)jjis written as(14)L0(t)jj=σ2h(αj,Ujj(t)),in which the mapping u↦h(α, u) fromℝinto ]0, +∞[ is defined in [36] and where(15)L0(t)12=σU12(t).In Eqs. (14) and (15), the different quantities are defined hereinafter.•σ=δ/3in which δ is a hyperparameter of the stochastic model, which allows for controlling the level of the statistical fluctuations, and which must satisfy0≤δ<3/7(note that δ=0 will correspond to the deterministic case, there are no statistical fluctuations).For j=1, 2, the real-valued parameter αjis such thatαj=(1−j+δ/3)/2.{U11(t),t∈ℝ},{U12(t),t∈ℝ}, and{U22(t),t∈ℝ}are three independent copies of a Gaussian stationary second-order centered normalized stochastic process{U(t),t∈ℝ}such that, for all fixed t, E{U(t)}=0 and E{U2(t)}=1.The Gaussian stationary centered stochastic process U is thus completely defined by its autocorrelation function RU(τ)=E{U(t+τ)U(t)} which is chosen as RU(τ)=exp{−b|τ|}, in which b is the second positive-valued hyperparameter of the stochastic model (therefore, for all b>0, we have effectively E{U2(t)}=1). Therefore, the corresponding power spectral density function, SU(ω), of stochastic process U is such thatRU(τ)=∫ℝeiωtSU(ω)dω,SU(ω)=12π2bω2+b2,The correlation time, τc, is defined byτc=∫0+∞exp{−b|τ|}dτ=1b.Consequently, hyperparameter b is related to the correlation time.The copies of Gaussian stationary stochastic process U will be generated in introducing a linear It stochastic differential equation.Taking into account the definition of stochastic process U, a realization (sample path or trajectory) of stochastic process U for t≥0 can be obtained by solving the following linear Itô stochastic differential equation,(16)dU(t)=−bU(t)dt+2bdW(t),t>0,with the random initial condition(17)U(0)=U0.In Eq. (16), {W(t), t≥0} is the normalized Wiener stochastic process [37,38]. The random initial condition U0 is a normalized Gaussian real-valued random variable (E{U0}=0 andE{U02}=1), which is independent of Wiener process {W(t), t≥0}. Note that the construction of the three copies U11, U12, and U22 of stochastic process U is obtained by solving Eq. (16) with Eq. (17) by using, for {W, U0}, three independent copies{W,U0}11,{W,U0}12, and{W,U0}22of the random variable U and of the Wiener stochastic process W.The objective of this section is to perform the numerical simulation of the system of nonlinear stochastic integro-differential equations in order to produce voice signals with jitter. The subglottal pressure ps(t) is a given deterministic function of time (according to the results obtained in [26]). The subglottal pressure ps(t) is deterministic and, without jitter, the glottal signal ug(t) is a periodic signal denoted byugp(t). Then, ifugp(t)was considered as a stochastic process, denoted by Ug(t), then Ug(t) that would be a periodic function, would not be a stationary stochastic process on the real line, and consequently, would not be ergodic. However, considering the presence of jitter in the voice signals generated, the stochastic process Ug(t) could be written asUg(t)=ugp(t)+Ugs(t), in whichugp(t)would be a periodic function and where the perturbation,Ugs(t), would be assumed to be a stationary and ergodic stochastic process. It is not easy to prove that the perturbationUgs(t)is stationary and ergodic. However, it is reasonable to introduce such a hypothesis that allows for giving a sense to the construction of the fundamental frequency as a random variable (by construction, the fundamental frequency is considered as a random variable that does not depend on time). In such a context, an important point is the construction of the estimation of the probability density function of this random fundamental frequency by using a time averaging related to a trajectory of the stochastic response. In addition, the convergence analysis of this probability density function with respect to the duration of the time averaging must be carried out. Such an analysis has been performed and the convergence has been obtained. Such properties can been viewed in looking at the results, which will be shown further in this section.It is important to say that there are three hyperparameters, ϵ>0, b>0, and δ>0, that have been introduced in Section 3.2 devoted to the construction of the stochastic modeling of the stiffnesses. Hyperparameter ϵ is a regularization parameter that can be chosen small and thus is fixed to the value 10−6. Hyperparameter b allows for controlling the correlation time τc, and thus, for controlling the bandwidth of power spectral density function SU. Therefore the color of the stiffnesses stationary signals, which impacts the coloring voice is controlled by this hyperparameter b. Hyperparameter δ controls the level of the statistical fluctuations that are injected in the stochastic model through the stochastic process [K(t)]. For the stochastic model proposed, δ must be such that0<δ<37[35].For the numerical simulations carried out with the deterministic model and with the stochastic model, the following nominal values of the parameters are: Ag0=0.05×10−2m2, ρ=0.12kg/m3, ca=346.3m/s, μ=1.86×10−4kg/(m2s), m1=0.125×10−3kg, m2=0.025×10−3kg, ℓ=1.4×10−2m, d1=0.25×10−2m, d2=0.05×10−2m.Concerning the numerical simulations carried out with the stochastic model, the mean valuesK_1,K_2, andK_c, which are the entries of the matrix[K_]areK_1=371N/m,K_2=64N/m, andK_c=105N/m. The stochastic solver used is the Monte Carlo method for which only one realization is computed and for which the ergodic property is used for the estimates of the statistics of interest. The realization is sampled with a sampling frequency fs=88, 200Hz, which yields a time step Δt=1/(2fs)s. The time of simulation for the realization is then given by N×Δt=0.5s. This number is enough in order to ensure the convergence of the solution to a stationary and ergodic stochastic process.At first, we take b=200 and three values of δ that are δ=0.001 (very small dispersion equivalent to the case without jitter), δ=0.05 and δ=0.1 for two cases with a significant jitter effect. Then, the three realizations of the glottal signal (stochastic process Ug) are shown in Fig. 2corresponding to these three values of (b, δ).In Fig. 2, it can be observed the variation of the amplitude, called shimmer, associated to the jitter. Let us consider the duration between to successive times, the first one corresponding to the instant the glottis opens and the second one the instant for it closes completely. This duration, denoted by Tfund is a random variable, and its inverse is defined as the fundamental frequency that is the random variable Ffund=1/Tfund. For each value of (b, δ), the probability density function of Ffund is estimated using the realization of the stochastic process Ugthat is numerically simulated, and is shown in Fig. 3for each value of (b, δ).In order to analyze the effects of the variation of hyperparameter b (that controls the time correlation) on the glottal signal, δ is fixed to the value 0.1 for b={50, 100, 150, 200}. Fig. 4displays the realizations of stochastic process Ugfor these three values of (b, δ).For each value (b, δ) of the hyperparameters, the probability density function of Ffund, which is estimated using the realization of the stochastic glottal signal (Ug) shown in Fig. 4, is displayed in Fig. 5.In Figs. 3 and 5, it can be seen that the probability density function of the random fundamental frequency, Ffund, is very sensitive to the values of hyperparameters b (controlling the color of the signal) and δ (controlling the level of the statistical fluctuations). This means that the stochastic model proposed has the capability to generate a large family of voice signals with a jitter effect. Figs. 2 and 4 show that the realizations of the glottal signal is sensitive to the value of δ, but would seem to be less or not sensitive to the value of b. In fact, the voice signals are effectively sensitive to the value of b as it can be listened in:https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vkwxjenxlix4ol/IF72SoundsJitter.zip?dl=0The utterance of vowel /a/, simulated with the stochastic model with jitter, for the different values of b and δ, can be listened using the internet link given before. The cases considered for the sounds are the following ones:•b=50 and δ=0.1: Male–b50delta01b=100 and δ=0.1: Male–b100delta01b=150 and δ=0.1: Male–b150delta01b=200 and δ=0.001: Male–b200delta0001b=200 and δ=0.1: Male–b200delta01b=200 and δ=0.05: Male–b200delta005Deterministic case: Male–deterministic.wavThe jitter features are also calculated using the Praat voice analysis software: http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/ that reports different types of measures for jitter listed below. The terminology used below corresponds to the one used by this software.Let T1, …, TNbe N realizations of the random variable Tfund, which correspond to successive values extracted from one realization of the stochastic glottal signal Ug(the total duration of the simulated realization of the glottal signal is thus T1+T2+⋯+TN). Consequently, the statistical estimation of the mean value of the random variable Tfund can be written as(18)T_fund=1N∑i=1NTi.Below, five quantities (introduced by the literature) are considered: absolute jitter, local jitter, RAP, PPQ5, and DDP. In general, the value 1.040% for the local jitter is considered as a threshold for the occurrence of a pathology, the value 0.680% for RAP is considered as a threshold for the occurrence of a pathology, and the value 0.840% for PPQ5 is considered as a threshold for pathology (as this number was based on jitter measurements influenced by noise, the correct threshold is probably lower). For instance the absolute jitter and the local jitter are defined as follows:Absolute jitter:Jitabs=1N−1∑i=1N−1|Ti−Ti+1|.Local jitter:Jitloc=Jitabs/T_fund.Summary of the jitter measures. Using the signals synthesized, with different levels of jitter, the Praat software was used for measuring jitter, considering approximately the same number of periods and during the time the subglottal pressure is constant. The results obtained are given in Table 1.The measures must not be considered as having precise values because they depend upon the length of the signal window considered. However, it can easily be seen that, for b=200 and δ=0.001, the voice signal produced with the stochastic model corresponds to a normal voice (without characteristics of pathologies), while for all the other cases, the voice signal produced corresponds to voices with characteristics of pathologies. The mean value of the random fundamental frequency Ffund of the voice signal considered is about 130Hz. Then, when b is near to this value (b=150), it can be seen that the values of jitter are less than when b is 100 or 200. The correlation time (equal to 1/b) is near to the mean valueT_fundof the random fundamental period.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
An approach has been proposed for constructing a stochastic model for creating jitter in a two-mass mechanical model used for producing voiced sounds. The stiffnesses of the model have been considered as stochastic processes, a stochastic stiffness matrix was constructed and its modeling proposed. The construction of the corresponding stochastic matrix permitted to generate jitter and its level can be controlled through different values of three hyperparameters. The probability density function of the so-called random fundamental frequency has been constructed and compared for different values of the hyperparameters. The voice signals have been synthesized with different levels of jitter, which could be easily perceived when they are listened. The model proposed gives excellent results for producing a jitter effect in the voice signals.
