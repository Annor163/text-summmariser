In this paper, the problem of relaxed observer design of discrete-time nonlinear systems is studied by developing a novel ranking-based switching mechanism. To do this, the useful ranking information of the normalized fuzzy weighting functions is utilized in order to give a denser subdivision of the normalized fuzzy weighting function space and therefore essentially yields the proposed ranking-based switching mechanism. Based on the obtained switching mechanism, a family of switching observers can be developed for the purpose of guaranteeing the estimation error system to be asymptotically stable with less conservatism than the existing results available in the references. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy models based on the sector nonlinearity approach [1] has been widely applied since they can exactly capture the bounded nonlinearities within a compact set of the systems state space. As a result of their usability, the problem of control synthesis based on T–S fuzzy models has been intensively studied and a great deal of important results have been proposed, such as adaptive fuzzy control designs [2–5], fuzzy state/output feedback control designs [6–10] and fuzzy-model-based fault detections [11–13]. However, in view of the fact that not all of the system state variables are available in actual control systems, the aforementioned results usually fail to work only if the problem of state estimations for unavailable system state variables could be well solved [14,15]. As far as T–S fuzzy model-based state estimations are concerned, some featured results have been proposed, e.g., filtering of continuous-time T–S fuzzy systems [16–18], non-fragile H∞ filtering [19–21], filtering of discrete-time T–S fuzzy systems [22,23], filtering of T–S fuzzy systems with time delays [24–26], and fuzzy model-based model reduction [27–29].Which deserving additional attention is, the aforementioned results are based on the parallel distributed compensation theory, and then the obtained fuzzy observers/filters are only dependent on the current-time normalized fuzzy weighting functions. Consequently, the obtained design conditions are rather conservative [30]. Recently, inspired by the so-called multi-instant matrix theory, a novel fuzzy observer that is parameter-dependent on multi-steps normalized fuzzy weighting functions has been provided for the purpose of achieving less conservative results in [31]. More recently, the result of [31] has been further relaxed in [32] by introducing the so-called ‘Slack Variable Approach’. Now, we may naturally raise a question: whether the conservatism will further reduced if more algebraic properties of the normalized fuzzy weighting functions are further fused into the process of future observer designs? That is to say, the research of exploring more efficient design conditions of fuzzy state estimations is still very challenging, which motivates us to present this study.In order to reducing the conservatism of the existing results, relaxed observer design conditions of discrete-time nonlinear systems are proposed by employing an efficient ranking-based switching mechanism. Using the ranking information of the normalized fuzzy weighting functions has a beneficial effect on giving a denser subdivision of the normalized fuzzy weighting function space and therefore essentially yields the proposed ranking-based switching mechanism. With the help of the proposed ranking-based switching mechanism, a kind of switching observer is developed and thus the estimation error system is ensured to be asymptotically stable with less conservatism than previous ones available in the literature.The rest of the study is arranged as follows: Background and key preliminaries are provided in Section 2. In Section 3, the main result is proposed. In Section 4, two illustrative numerical examples are presented to show the advantages of the proposed method. Finally, some conclusions are provided and thus completes the paper in Section 5.Notations. In this paper,ℝstands for the set of real numbers,ℤ+represents the set of positive integers,ℕdenotes the set of natural numbers, i.e., {0, 1, 2, …}. Moreover, p! represents the factorial, i.e., p!=p(p−1)(p−2)⋯(2)(1) forp∈ℕ, and in particular one has 0!=1. Also, we define the left-hand side of a relation as Left(·), and He(E) stands for E+ET.A family of discrete-time nonlinear systems can be represented by the following T–S fuzzy model [1]:(1)x(t+1)=∑i=1rhi(z(t)){Aix(t)+Biu(t)}y(t)=∑i=1rhi(z(t)){Cix(t)}In detail,x(t)∈ℝn1stands for the system state vector,u(t)∈ℝn2stands for the control input vector,y(t)∈ℝn3stands for the system output vector, z(t) denotes the available premise variable, and hi(z(t)) stands for the ith current–time normalized fuzzy weighting function,Ai∈ℝn1×n1,Bi∈ℝn1×n2,Ci∈ℝn3×n1are a bank of prior known system parameter matrices.More importantly, it is worth noticing that not all of the system state variables are available in actual control systems. As a result if this reason, the problem of state estimations for unavailable system state variables have attracted a lot of attention, e.g. those results given in [30–32]. In this study, our main objective is to propose a bank of more relaxed observer design conditions such that the unavailable system state variables can be estimated by employing the available y(t).Next, let's give a bank of important notations about homogeneous polynomials which are fairly standard as those applied in [31,32].The set Δris defined asΔr={α∈ℝr;∑i=1rαi=1;α≥0}.α1k1α2k2⋯αrkr,α∈Δr,ki∈ℤ+,i=1,2,…,rare defined as the monomials, k=k1k2⋯kr, andPk∈ℝn×n,∀k∈K(g)are matrix-valued coefficients. Here,K(g)represents the set of r-tuples obtained as all possible combinations of nonnegative integers ki, i=1, 2, …, r, satisfying∑i=1rki=g. By definitions, π(k)=(k1!)(k2!)⋯(kr!),χi=0⋯01︸i−th0⋯0. Particularly, we write k≥k′ ifki≥ki′,(i=1,…,r). The usual operations of summation, k+k′, and subtraction, k−k′ (whenever k≥k′), are defined componentwise. Furthermore, some shortenings are utilized in this study as follows:(2)h(z(t−j))={h1(z(t−j)),⋯,hr(z(t−j))}T,j∈{−1,0,1,2,…},hk(z(t−j))=h1k1(z(t−j))×h2k2(z(t−j))×⋯×hrkr(z(t−j)).Finally, an important lemma is also mentioned here.Lemma 1[33]. For two symmetric matrices P>0 and P+>0, the matrix inequality ATP+A−P<0 holds, if there is another matrix G such thatP(*)GAG+GT−P+>0.In order to state the idea of ranking-based switching mechanism clearly, a simple example is given to make the issue easier to understand.If r=3, then the normalized fuzzy weighting function space can be divided into six sub-spaces, i.e., h1(z(t))≥h2(z(t))≥h3(z(t))≥0, h1(z(t))≥h3(z(t)))≥h2(z(t))≥0, h2(z(t))≥h1(z(t))≥h3(z(t))≥0, h2(z(t))≥h3(z(t))≥h1(z(t))≥0, h3(z(t))≥h1(z(t))≥h2(z(t))≥0 and h3(z(t))≥h2(z(t))≥h1(z(t))≥0.Obviously, different normalized fuzzy weighting function plays different role in any chosen sub-space. For instance, h1(z(t)) plays the most important role in the sub-space generated by h1(z(t))≥h2(z(t))≥h3(z(t))≥0 while h3(z(t)) plays the least important role in it. Now, with an idea in mind, if the ranking information could be well utilized for observer design, then the conservatism of the existing results will be reduced. Therefore, a ranking-based switching mechanism is proposed as the following two steps:(1)sorting a set of {hi(z(t)), i∈{1, 2, …, r}} in descending order and recording their indexes (i.e., i∈{1, 2, …, r}) sequentially by {num(j), j∈{1, 2, …, r}}. In particular, in case ofhj1(z(t))=hj2(z(t)), one can sort them in descending order according to the values of j1 and j2.choosing the operating mode according to the obtained {num(j), j∈{1, 2, …, r}}. Indeed, there are (r!) kinds of possible combinations of {num(j), j∈{1, 2, …, r}}, i.e., one can select a proper operating mode among these (r!) kinds of operating modes while the ranking information is well utilized.Given an illustrative here, for the case of r=2 and m=2, one getsK111,K112,K121,K122,K211,K212,K221,K222,G111,G112,G121,G122, andG211,G212,G221,G222.If one defines the estimation error ase(t)=x(t)−xˆ(t), then the estimation error system is derived as follows:(6)e(t+1)=(Az(t)−(Gz(t−m+1)⋯z(t)i)−1Kz(t−m+1)⋯z(t)iCz(t))e(t).Definition 1[1]. For any initial condition, the estimation error system (6) could be called to be globally asymptotically stable if one haslimt→+∞e(t)=0.Theorem 1For a bank of prescribedds∈ℤ+, with s∈{1, 2, …, m+1},m∈ℤ+and m≥2, if there exist matricesKi1⋯imi∈ℝn1×n3, matricesGi1⋯imi∈ℝn1×n1, symmetric matricesPi1⋯imi∈ℝn1×n1, and negative definite matricesXji∈ℝ2n1×2n1with i∈{1, 2, …, (r!)}, i1, …, im∈{1, 2, …, r}, j∈{1, …, r−1}, such that the LMIs provided by(7)are satisfied, then the estimation error system(6)could be called to be globally asymptotically stable, while the underlying LMIs are represented as follows:(7)Γk1⋯km+1i>0,∀i∈{1,2,…,(r!)},ks∈K(ds+1),s∈{1,2,…,m−1};km∈K(dm+2),km+1∈K(dm+1+1);andΓk1⋯km+1iis presented in(8):(8)Γk1⋯km+1i=∑(is∈{1,…,r},s∈{1,…,m−1},ks−χis≥0;im,l∈{1,...,r},km−χim−χl≥0)ϕk1,…,km+1i1⋯imlΞk1⋯km+1i1⋯imli+∑(l∈{num(1),…,num(r)}km−χl≥0)ψk1⋯km+1liΨli+∑(is∈{1,…,r},s∈{1,…,m}ks+1−χis≥0)φk1⋯km+1i1⋯imΘk1⋯km+1i1⋯im,ϕk1⋯km+1i1⋯iml=∏s=1m−1(ds)!π(ks−χis)dm!π(km−χim−χl)(dm+1+1)!π(km+1),Ξk1⋯km+1i1⋯imli=Pi1⋯im*Gi1⋯imiAl−Ki1⋯imiClGi1⋯imi+Gi1⋯imiT,Θk1⋯km+1i1⋯im=0*0−Pi1⋯im,φk1⋯km+1i1⋯im=(d1+1)!π(k1)∏s=2m−1(ds)!π(ks−χis−1)(dm+1)!π(km−χim−1)dm+1!π(km+1−χim),ψk1⋯km+1li=∏s=1m−1(ds+1)!π(ks)(dm+1)!π(km−χl)(dm+1+1)!π(km+1),Ψli=X1i,forl=num(1)Xji−Xj−1i,forl=num(j),1<j<r−Xr−1i,forl=num(r)ProofFirstly, the following fuzzy Lyapunov function is selected in this study:(9)V(e(t),z(t))=eT(t)(Pz(t−m+1)⋯z(t))e(t),and we havePz(t−m+1)⋯z(t)=∑(is∈{1,⋯,r},s∈{1,⋯,m})(∏s=1mhis(z(t−m+s)))Pi1⋯im.As a result of (9), the first difference of V(e, z) along the solution to the estimation error system (6) yields the following equation:(10)▵V(e,z)=V(e(t+1),z(t+1))−V(e(t),z(t))=eT(t)(ΣTPz(t−m+2)⋯z(t+1)Σ−Pz(t−m+1)⋯z(t))e(t),andΣ=Az(t)−(Gz(t−m+1)⋯z(t)i)−1Kz(t−m+1)⋯z(t)iCz(t),Pz(t−m+2)⋯z(t+1)=∑(is∈{1,⋯,r},s∈{1,⋯,m})(∏s=1mhis(z(t−m+s+1)))Pi1⋯im.Using the Lyapunov stability theory, the estimation error system (6) is globally asymptotically stable if the following matrix inequality holds:(11)(ΣTPz(t−m+2)⋯z(t+1)Σ−Pz(t−m+1)⋯z(t))<0.Further, recalling two facts hnum(j)−hnum(j+1)≥0 andXji≤0, and then applying Lemma 1 here, it can be found that (11) is satisfied if the key inequality holds in true:(12)Pz(t−m+1)⋯z(t)*Gz(t−m+1)⋯z(t)iAz(t)−Kz(t−m+1)⋯z(t)iCz(t)He(Gz(t−m+1)⋯z(t)i)−Pz(t−m+2)⋯z(t+1)+∑j=1r−1hnum(j)−hnum(j+1)Xji>0.Consequently, Left(12) is expanded as follows by utilizing the given important notations about homogeneous polynomials:(13)Left(12)=∑(ks∈K(ds+1),s∈{1,2,…,m−1};km∈K(dm+2);km+1∈K(dm+1+1))∏s=1m+1hks(z(t−m+s))Γk1⋯km+1i,whereds∈ℤ+, with s∈{1, 2, …, m+1};Γk1⋯km+1iis presented in (8).Therefore, from (13), we can obtain that Left(12)>0 is satisfied if the LMIs provided by (7) are satisfied. In other words, it has been concluded that the estimation error system (6) is globally asymptotically stable if the LMIs provided by (7) are satisfied.This completes the proof.□With a view to another aspect, a slack variable approach is presented in [32] for the purpose of reducing the conservatism of its previous results (e.g. the result given in [31]). Noticing that the combination of the result given in Theorem 1 and the extension of slack variable approach may lead to more efficient results, the result given in Theorem 1 will be further improved in the following theorem.Theorem 2For a bank of prescribedds∈ℤ+, with s∈{1, 2, …, m+1},m∈ℤ+and m≥2, if there exist matricesKi1⋯imi∈ℝn1×n3, matricesGi1⋯imi∈ℝn1×n1, symmetric matricesPi1⋯imi∈ℝn1×n1, and negative definite matricesXji∈ℝ2n1×2n1with i∈{1, 2, …, (r!)}, i1, …, im∈{1, 2, …, r}, j∈{1, …, r−1}, symmetric matricesEk1⋯km+1ijj∈ℝ2n1×2n1and matricesEk1⋯km+1ijl∈ℝ2n1×2n1withEk1⋯km+1ijl=(Ek1⋯km+1ilj)T,Ek1⋯km+1ijj=0ifkjm−2<0, andEk1⋯km+1ijl=0ifkjm−1<0orklm−1<0, forkl∈K(dl+1),l∈{1,2,⋯,m−1};km∈K(dm),km+1∈K(dm+1+1)and 1≤i≤j≤r, such that the LMIs provided by(14)–(15)are satisfied, then the estimation error system(6)could be called to be globally asymptotically stable, while the underlying LMIs are represented as follows:(14)Γk1⋯km+1i+∑1≤j≤rEk1⋯(km−2χj)km+1ijj+He∑1≤j<l≤rEk1⋯(km−χj−χl)km+1ijl>0,(15)∀i∈{1,2,…,(r!)};ks∈K(ds+1),s∈{1,2,…,m−1};km∈K(dm+2);km+1∈K(dm+1+1);Ek1⋯km+1i11⋯Ek1⋯km+1i1r⋮⋱⋮Ek1⋯km+1ir1⋯Ek1⋯km+1irr≤0,∀i∈{1,2,…,(r!)};ks∈K(ds+1),s∈{1,2,…,m−1};km∈K(dm);km+1∈K(dm+1+1);whereΓk1⋯km+1ihas been given in(8).Based on the result given in Theorem 1, the proof is straight-forward with review of the proof in [32], and thus it can be omitted here.Example 1In this example, the same discrete-time T–S fuzzy system that has been used in [31,32] is as well employed:(16)x(t+1)=∑i=12hi(z(t))(Aix(t)+Biu(t)),y(t)=∑i=12hi(z(t))Cix(t),A1=2.510.52,A2=0.502.5a,B1=B2=10,C1=b1,C2=11.Firstly, two methods without using slack variables, i.e., the result of [31] and the result of Theorem 1, are both applied to the above example for the purpose of a fair comparison. To be specific, six different cases are chosen as:‘Case 1 of [31]’ stands for Theorem 2 of [31] with m=2, d1=1, d2=1 and d3=1,‘Case 2 of [31]’ stands for Theorem 2 of [31] with m=2, d1=2, d2=2 and d3=2,‘Case 3 of [31]’ stands for Theorem 2 of [31] with m=2, d1=2, d2=4 and d3=2,‘Case 1 of Theorem 1’ stands for Theorem 1 of this paper with m=2, d1=1, d2=1 and d3=1,‘Case 2 of Theorem 1’ stands for Theorem 1 of this paper with m=2, d1=2, d2=2 and d3=2,‘Case 3 of Theorem 1’ stands for Theorem 1 of this paper with m=2, d1=2, d2=4 and d3=2.Secondly, another two methods with using slack variables, i.e., the result of [32] and the result of Theorem 2, are both applied to the above example for the purpose of a fair comparison. To be specific, two different cases are chosen as:‘The results of [32]’ stands for Theorem 1 of [32] with m=2, d1=1, d2=1 and d3=1,‘The results of Theorem 2’ stands for Theorem 2 of this paper with m=2, d1=1, d2=1 and d3=1.As indicated in Fig. 1, a tunnel diode circuit that is characterized by the equationiD(t)=0.002vD(t)+0.01vD3(t). As done in [32], we can choosex1(t)=vC(t)and x2(t)=iL(t) to be the system state variables, and thus the tunnel diode circuit is converted into the following system state equations:Cx˙1(t)=−0.002x1(t)−0.01x13(t)+x2(t)Lx˙2(t)=−x1(t)−Rx2(t)y(t)=Sx(t)where y(t) represents the measurement output, z(t) represents the controlled output andS=[10]represents the sensor matrix which means that onlyvC(t)is measurable. According to the practical situation, the parameters of the circuit are chosen as: C=20mF, L=1000mH, R=10Ω. Therefore, the state-space model can be written as follows:x˙1(t)=−0.1x1(t)−(0.5x12(t))x1(t)+50x2(t)x˙2(t)=−x1(t)−10x2(t)y(t)=x1(t)Setting the sampling time interval as T=0.02, the discrete-time T–S model is obtained with the following parameters:A1=0.98870.9024−0.01800.8100,A2=0.90330.8617−0.01720.8103,B21=0.00930.0181,B22=0.00910.0181,C1=C2=[10],D1=D2=1.According to the practical situation, two normalized fuzzy weighting functions are described by the following equations:h1(z(t))=x1(t)+33,−3≤x1(t)≤00,x1(t)<−33−x1(t)3,0≤x1(t)≤30,x1(t)>3,h2(z(t))=1−h1(z(t)).In this experiment, the method provided by Theorem 1 of this paper with m=2 and d1=d2=d3=1 is applied and thus a family of feasible solutions to the LMIs (7) are gained:K111=0.9773−0.5341,K121=0.18150.2121,K211=0.9776−0.5338,K221=0.18210.2126,G111=0.8431−0.5134−0.67231.1617,G121=0.09040.24310.11570.1417,G211=0.8428−0.5136−0.67251.1615,G221=0.09030.24310.11570.1416,K112=0.15750.1340,K122=0.9780−0.4469,K212=0.15790.1346,K222=0.9784−0.4466,G112=0.03330.28480.06450.1837,G122=0.9008−0.5430−0.63331.1191,G212=0.03320.28470.06450.1837,G222=0.9006−0.5431−0.63361.1188.Firstly, the initial condition is selected as x(0)=(1, −1)Tandxˆ(0)=(1,−2)T, respectively. Then, using the obtained fuzzy switching observer (3) with the above matrix-valued observer parameters, the trajectory of the estimation errore2(t)=x2(t)−xˆ2(t)(i.e., the error between iL(t) and its estimated value) is displayed in Fig. 2. As can be easily found from Fig. 2, the estimation error system is asymptotically stable for the 1st case. Secondly, another initial condition is selected as x(0)=(1, −1)Tandxˆ(0)=(1,0)T, respectively. In the same way, employing the obtained fuzzy switching observer (3), the trajectory of the estimation errore2(t)=x2(t)−xˆ2(t)(i.e., the error between iL(t) and its estimated value) is also given in Fig. 3. As can be easily found in Fig. 3, the estimation error system is asymptotically stable for the 2st case. In other words, the estimation error system is globally asymptotically stable by using the proposed fuzzy observer which is implemented by solving LMI-based conditions given in this paper.
