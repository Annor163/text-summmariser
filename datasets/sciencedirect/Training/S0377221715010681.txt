@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper we address the problem of measuring the degree of consensus/dissensus in a context where experts or agents express their opinions on alternatives or issues by means of cardinal evaluations. To this end we propose a new class of distance-based consensus model, the family of the Mahalanobis dissensus measures for profiles of cardinal values. We set forth some meaningful properties of the Mahalanobis dissensus measures. Finally, an application over a real empirical example is presented and discussed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In Decision Making Theory and its applications, consensus measurement and its reaching in a society (i.e., a group of agents or experts) are relevant research issues. Many studies investigating the aforementioned subjects have been carried out under several frameworks (see Cabrerizo, Moreno, Pérez, & Herrera-Viedma, 2010; Dong, Xu, & Li, 2008; Dong, Xu, Li, & Feng, 2010; Dong & Zhang, 2014; Fedrizzi, Fedrizzi, & Marques Pereira, 2007; Fu & Yang, 2012; Herrera-Viedma, Herrera, & Chiclana, 2002; Liu, Liao, & Yang, 2015; Palomares, Estrella-Liébana, Martínez, & Herrera, 2014; Wu & Chiclana, 2014a, 2014b; Wu, Chiclana, & Herrera-Viedma, 2015 among others) and based on different methodologies (Chiclana, Tapia García, del Moral, & Herrera-Viedma, 2013; Cook, 2006; Eklund, Rusinowska, & de Swart, 2008; Eklund, Rusinowska, & Swart, 2007; Fedrizzi et al., 2007; Fu & Yang, 2010, 2011; Gong, Zhang, Forrest, Li, & Xu, 2015; González-Pachón & Romero, 1999; Liu et al., 2015; Palomares & Martínez, 2014 among others).Since the seminal contribution by Bosch (2005) several authors have addressed the consensus measurement topic from an axiomatic perspective. Earlier analyses can be mentioned, e.g., Hays (1960) or Day and McMorris (1985). This issue is also seen as the problem of combining a set of ordinal rankings to obtain an indicator of their ‘consensus’, a term with multiple possible meanings (Martínez-Panero, 2011).Generally speaking, the usual axiomatic approaches assume that each individual expresses his or her opinions through ordinal preferences over the alternatives. A group of agents is characterized by the set of their preferences – their preference profile. Then a consensus measure is a mapping which assigns to each preference profile a number between 0 and 1. The assumption is made that the higher the values, the more consensus in the profile.Technical restrictions on the preferences provide various approaches in the literature. In most cases the agents are presumed to linearly order the alternatives (see Bosch, 2005 or Alcalde-Unzu & Vorsatz, 2013). Since this assumption seems rather demanding (especially as the number of alternatives grows), an obvious extension is to allow for ties. This is the case where the agents have complete preorders on the alternatives (e.g., García-Lapresta & Pérez-Román, 2011). Alcantud, de Andrés Calle, and Cascón (2013a, 2015) take a different position. They study the case where agents have dichotomous opinions on the alternatives, a model that does not necessarily require pairwise comparisons.Notwithstanding the use of different ordinal preference frameworks, the problem of how to measure consensus is an open-ended question in several research areas. This fact is due to that methodology used in each case is a relevant element in the problem addressed. To date various methods have been developed to measure consensus under ordinal preference structures based on distances and association measures like Kemeny’s distance, Kendall’s coefficient, Goodman-Kruskal’s index and Spearman’s coefficient among others (see e.g., Cook & Seiford, 1982; Goodman & Kruskal, 1979; Kemeny, 1959; Kendall & Gibbons, 1990; Spearman, 1904).In this paper we first tackle the analysis of coherence that derives from profiles of cardinal rather than ordinal evaluations. Modern convention applies the term cardinal to measurements that assign significance to differences (cf., Basu, 1982; Chiclana, Herrera-Viedma, Alonso, & Herrera, 2009; High & Bloch, 1989). In contrast ordinal preferences only permit to order the alternatives from best to worst without any additional information. To see how this affects the analysis of our problem, let us consider a naive example of a society with two agents. They evaluate two public goods with monetary amounts. One agent gives a value of 1€ for the first good and 2€ for the second good. The other agent values these goods at 10€ and 90€ respectively. If we only use the ordinal information in this case, we should conclude that there is unanimity in the society: all members agree that ‘good 2 is more valuable than good 1’. However the agents disagree largely. Therefore, the subtleties of cardinality clearly have an impact when we aim at measuring the cohesiveness of cardinal evaluations.Unlike previous references, we adopt the notion of dissensus measure as the fundamental concept. This seems only natural because it resembles more the notion of a “measure of statistical dispersion”, in the sense that 0 captures the natural notion of unanimity as total lack of variability among agents, and then increasingly higher numbers mean more disparity among evaluations in the profile.11As a remote antecedent of this position, we note that statistically variance-based methods are commonly employed to measure consensus of verbal opinions (cf., Hoffman, 1994, and Mejias, Shepherd, Vogel, & Lazaneo, 1996.)In order to build a particular dissensus measure we adopt a distance-based approach. Firstly, one computes the distances between each pair of individuals. Then all these distances are aggregated. In our present proposal the distances (or similarities) are computed through the Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis, 1936). We thus define the class of Mahalanobis dissensus measures.The Mahalanobis distance plays an important role in Statistics and Data Analysis. It arises as a natural generalization of the Euclidean distance. A Mahalanobis distance accounts for the effects of differences in scales and associations among magnitudes. Consequently, building on the well-known performance of the Mahalanobis distance, our novel proposal seems especially fit for the cases when the measurement units of the issues are different, e.g., performance appraisal processes when employees are evaluated attending to their productivity and their leadership capacity; or where the issues are correlated. For example, evaluation of related public projects. An antecedent for the weaker case of profiles of preferences has been provided elsewhere, cf. Alcantud, de Andrés Calle, and González-Arteaga (2013b), and an application to comparisons of real rankings on universities worldwide is developed. Here we apply our new indicator to a real situation, namely, economic forecasts made by several agencies. Since the forecasts concern economic quantities, they have an intrinsic value which is naturally cardinal and also there are relations among them.The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce basic notation and definitions. In Section 3, we set forth the class of the Mahalanobis dissensus measures and their main properties. Section 4 provides a comparison of several Mahalanobis dissensus measures. Next, a practical application with discussion is given in Section 5. Finally, we present some concluding remarks. Appendices contain proofs of some properties and a short review in matrix algebra.This section is devoted to introduce some notation and a new concept in order to compare group cohesiveness: namely, dissensus measures. Then, a comparison with the standard approach is made. We partially borrow notation and definitions from Alcantud et al. (2013b). In addition, we use some elements of matrix analysis that we recall in Appendix B to make the paper self-contained.LetX={x1,…,xk}be the finite set of k issues, options, alternatives, or candidates. It is assumed that X contains at least two options, i.e., the cardinality of X is at least 2. Abusing notation, on occasions we refer to issue xsas issue s for convenience. A population of agents or experts is a finite subsetN={1,2,…,N}of natural numbers. To avoid trivialities we assume N > 1.We consider that each expert evaluates each alternative by means of a quantitative value. The quantitative information gathered from the set of N experts on the set of k alternatives is summarized by an N × k numerical matrix M:M=(Mij)N×kWe write Mito denote the evaluation vector of agent i over the issues (i.e., row i of M) and Mjto denote the vector with all the evaluations for issue j (i.e., column j of M). For convenience, (1)N × kdenotes the N × k matrix whose cells are all equal to 1 and1Ndenotes the column vector whose N elements are equal to 1. We writeMN×kfor the set of all N × k real-valued matrices. AnyM∈MN×kis called a profile.Any permutation σ of the experts{1,2,…,N}determines a profile Mσby permutation of the rows of M: row i of the profile Mσis row σ(i) of the profile M. Similarly, any permutation π of the alternatives{1,2,…,k}determines a profileπM by permutation of the columns of M: column i of the profileπM is column π(i) of the profile M.For each profileM∈MN×k,its restriction to subprofile on the issues inI⊆X,denotedMI,arises from exactly selecting the columns of M that are associated with the respective issues inI(in the same order). And for simplicity, ifI={j}thenMI=M{j}=Mjis column j of M. Any partition{I1,…,Is}of{1,2,…,k},that we identify with a partition of X, generates a decompositionof M into subprofilesMI1,…,MIs.22A partition of a set S is a collection of pairwise disjoints non-empty subsets of S whose union is S.A profileM∈MN×kis unanimous if the evaluations for all the alternatives are the same across experts. In matrix terms, the columns ofM∈MN×kare constant, or equivalently, all rows of the profile are coincident.An expansion of a profileM∈MN×kof N onX={x1,…,xk}is a profileM¯∈MN¯×kofN¯={1,…,N,N+1,…,N¯}onX={x1,...,xk},such that the restriction ofM¯to the first N experts of N coincides with M.Finally, a replication of a profileM∈MN×kof the society N onX={x1,…,xk}is the profileM⊎M∈M2N×kobtained by duplicating each row of M, in the sense that rows t andN+tof M⊎M are coincident and equal to row t of M, for eacht=1,…,N.We now define a dissensus measure as follows:Definition 1A dissensus measure onMN×kis a mapping defined byδ:MN×k→[0,∞)with the property:(i)Unanimity: for eachM∈MN×k,δ(M)=0if and only if the profileM∈MN×kis unanimous.We also define a normal dissensus measure as a dissensus measure that additionally verifies:Anonymity:δ(Mσ)=δ(M)for each permutation σ of the agents andM∈MN×k.Neutrality:δ(πM)=δ(M)for each permutation π of the alternatives andM∈MN×k.This definition does not attempt to state dissensus by opposition to consensus. The literature usually deals with a formulation of consensus where the higher the index, the more coherence in the society’s opinions. The terms consensus and dissensus should not be taken as formal antonyms, especially because a universally accepted definition of consensus is not available and we do not intend to give an absolute concept of dissensus. However, consensus measures in the sense of Bosch (see Bosch, 2005, Definition 3.1) verify anonymity and neutrality (see also Alcantud et al., 2013b, Definition 1), and from a purely technical viewpoint, they relate to dissensus measures as follows.Lemma 1If μ is a consensus measure then1−μis a normal dissensus measure. Conversely, if δ is a normal dissensus measure then1δ+1is a consensus measure.We just need to recall that the mappingi:[0,∞)⟶(0,1]given byi(x)=1x+1is strictly decreasing.□In this section we introduce a broad class of dissensus measures that depends on a reference matrix, namely the Mahalanobis dissensus measures. We also give its more prominent properties.Our interest is to cover the specific characteristics in cardinal profiles, like possible differences in scales, and correlations among the issues. Before providing our main definition, we recover the definition of the Mahalanobis distance on which our measure is based.Definition 2LetΣ∈Mk×kbe a positive definite matrix and let us assume that x and y vectors fromRkare row vectors. The Mahalanobis (squared) distance onRkassociated with Σ is defined by33Our choice of dΣ(x, y) coincides with the original Mahalanobis’ definition (see Mahalanobis, 1936). In order to exploit the inclusion of the Euclidean distance, some authors work withdΣ(x,y)instead. In both cases we have distances onRk.dΣ(x,y)=(x−y)Σ−1(x−y)tThe off-diagonal elements of Σ permit to account for cross relations among the issues or alternatives. Through the diagonal elements different measurement scales can be incorporated. The Σ matrix contains variances and covariances among random variables when the Mahalanobis distance is used in Statistical Data Analysis.Definition 3LetΣ∈Mk×kbe a positive definite matrix. The Mahalanobis dissensus measure onMN×kassociated with Σ is the mappingδΣ:MN×k→Rgiven by(1)δΣ(M)=1CN2·∑i<jdΣ(Mi,Mj)=1CN2·∑i<j(Mi−Mj)Σ−1(Mi−Mj)tfor each profileM∈MN×kon k alternatives, whereCN2=N(N−1)2is the number of non-ordered pairs of the N agents.Note that the above expression is the average of all distances between the evaluation vectors provided by all pairs of agents according to the Mahalanobis distance associated with Σ (Definition 2).It is immediate to check that δΣverifies conditions i) and ii) for each positive definite Σ matrix. But δΣfails to satisfy neutrality like the following example proves.Example 1LetΣ=(1002),k=2andN=2. ThenΣ−1=(10012). ForM=(1−130)one hasM1=(1,−1)andM2=(3,0). ThenδΣ(M)=1C22·((1−3,−1−0)Σ−1(1−3,−1−0)t)=92.If the columns of M are permuted in order to obtainπM=(−1103),thenδΣ(πM)=1C22·((−1−0,1−3)Σ−1(−1−0,1−3)t)=3.ThereforeδΣ(πM)=3≠92=δΣ(M),which proves that δΣdoes not verify neutrality.Nevertheless, if the Σ matrix is adapted according to a specific permutation of the alternatives then the Mahalanobis disensus measure verifies a kind of “soft” neutrality like the following result proves.Proposition 1LetΣ∈Mk×kbe a positive definite matrix. For each profileM∈MN×kand each permutation π of the alternatives, i.e., a permutation of{1,…,k},δΣ(M)=δΣπ(πM)whereΣπ=PπtΣPπand Pπ is the permutation matrix corresponding to π.Using the definition of Mahalanobis dissensus measure (Definition 3), it is sufficient to prove thatdΣπ(πMi,πMj)=dΣ(Mi,Mj)dΣπ(πMi,πMj)=(πMi−πMj)(Σπ)−1(πMi−πMj)t=(MiPπ−MjPπ)(PπtΣPπ)−1(MiPπ−MjPπ)t=(Mi−Mj)PπPπtΣ−1PπPπt(Mi−Mj)t=(Mi−Mj)Σ−1(Mi−Mj)t=dΣ(Mi,Mj).We have only used the fact that the permutation matrix Pπis orthogonal.□Some special instances of Mahalanobis dissensus measures have specific interpretations.•If we have a single issue or alternative, thenM∈MN×1is a vector and Σ can be identified as a number c > 0. Thenδc(M)=1CN2·∑i<j1c(Mi−Mj)2=1c·2NN−1·SM2whereSM2is the sample variance of M.44In order to check this, we use a well-known property of the variance: given a vectorx=(x1,x2,…,xn),whose mean isx¯,Sx2=1n∑i=1n(xi−x¯)2=12n2∑i=1n∑j=1n(xi−xj)2.Therefore the dissensus for a single issue is the result of correcting its sample variance by a factor of1c·2NN−1.If Σ is the identity, thenδI(M)=1CN2·∑i<j∑r=1k(Mir−Mjr)2.This expression uses the square of the Euclidean distance between real-valued vectors, thus it recovers a version of the consensus measure for ordinal preferences based on this distance (Cook & Seiford, 1982). Henceforth δIis called the Euclidean dissensus measure.IfΣ=diag(c11,…,ckk)is a diagonal matrix then  dΣ(Mi, Mj) gives the weighted average of the square of the differences in assessments for each alternative between agents i and j, where the weight attached to alternative r is1crr:δΣ(M)=1CN2·∑i<jdΣ(Mi,Mj)=1CN2·∑i<j(∑r=1k1crr·(Mir−Mjr)2)=∑r=1k1crr·δI(Mr).This particular specification of the dissensus measure allows us to incorporate different weights to the alternatives. This fact increases the richness of the analysis in comparison with the (square of the) Euclidean distance. Furthermore, ifΣ=λIfor some λ > 0, then Proposition 2 below gives additional relationships.Proposition 2 gives the relation between the Euclidean dissensus measure and the Mahalanobis dissensus measure associated with a matrix which is a multiple of the identity matrix,Σ=λI.Proposition 2For each profileM∈MN×kand λ > 0,δλI(M)=δI(1λ·M)=1λ·δI(M).Using Definition 3, the assertion is direct if we checkdλI(Mi,Mj)=dI(1λ·Mi,1λ·Mj)anddλI(Mi,Mj)=1λ·dI(Mi,Mj).dλI(Mi,Mj)=(Mi−Mj)(λI)−1(Mi−Mj)t=(Mi−Mj)(1λ⋯0⋮⋱⋮0⋯1λ)(Mi−Mj)t=∑r=1k1λ·(Mir−Mjr)2=∑r=1k(1λ·Mir−1λ·Mjr)2=(1λ·Mi−1λ·Mj)(1⋯0⋮⋱⋮0⋯1)×(1λ·Mi−1λ·Mj)t=dI(1λ·Mi,1λ·Mj).dλI(Mi,Mj)=1λ·∑r=1k(Mir−Mjr)2=1λ·(Mi−Mj)(1⋯0⋮⋱⋮0⋯1)(Mi−Mj)t=1λ·dI(Mi,Mj).□Measuring cohesiveness by means of the Mahalanobis dissensus measure ensures some interesting operational features. We proceed to examine them. The proofs of these properties are given in Appendix A.LetM∈MN×kdenote a profile and let Σ,Σ1,Σ2∈Mk×kbe positive definite matrices. The following properties hold true:1.Neutrality. A dissensus measure δΣverifies neutrality if and only if the associated Σ matrix is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the same. Formally:δΣ(M)=δΣ(πM)any profileM∈MN×kand any permutation π of{1,…,k},if and only ifΣ=diag{λ,…,λ}for some λ > 0.Oneness. If for a particular size N of a society the Mahalanobis dissensus measures associated with two matrices coincide for all possible profiles, then the corresponding dissensus measures are equal. Formally:If for a fixed N it is the case thatδΣ1(M)=δΣ2(M)for each profileM∈MN×k,thenΣ1=Σ2,i.e., for each N′ andM′∈MN′×k,it is also the case thatδΣ1(M′)=δΣ2(M′).Cardinal transformations. In contrast to ordinal assessments, cardinal evaluations are dependent on scales. So an important question arises about if the scale choice disturbs the cohesiveness measures. In this regard, once we update the reference matrix accordingly, the Mahalanobis dissensus measures associated to Σ do not vary. This fact happens even if we modify the scales of all issues in different way. In addition, a simple translation of each issue by adding a number does not change the cohesiveness measure. Formally:Leta=(a1,…,ak)tbe a column vector andB=diag(b1,…,bk)be a diagonal matrix. The affine transformation of the profileM∈MN×kisM*=1Nat+MB,M*∈MN×k. Its columns are defined byM*j=aj·1N+bj·Mjand its rows are defined byMi*=(a1+b1Mi1,…,ak+bkMik)=a+MiB.IfM*=1Nat+MBis a positive affine transformation of the profileM∈MN×kandΣ*=BΣBtis the corresponding adjusted Σ, thenδΣ*(M*)=δΣ(M).Replication monotonicity. When a non-unanimous society is replicated, its dissensus measure increases. That is, ifM∈MN×kis a non-unanimous profile thenδΣ(M⊎M)=(2N−22N−1)·δΣ(M)thereforeδΣ(M⊎M)>δΣ(M).We can note that the difference between such measures is negligible for large societies. In addition, if we have an unanimous profileM∈MN×kthen by Definition 1 i), δΣverifiesδΣ(M⊎M)=δΣ(M)=0.Splitting the set of alternatives.Suppose that the set of alternatives is divided in two (or more) subgroups, in such way that we do not consider any possible cross-effect among subgroups (perhaps because we know that there is not interdependence). Then the computation can be simplified by referring to measures of the dissensus in sub-profiles as follows.GivenΣ=(Σ1100Σ22),whereΣ11∈Mr×r,Σ22∈M(k−r)×(k−r),for each profileM=(MI1,MI2)whereMI1∈MN×r,MI2∈MN×(k−r)δΣ(M)=δΣ11(MI1)+δΣ22(MI2).Remark 1Note that if the Σ matrix was originally a block diagonal matrix in the formΣ=diag(Σ11,…,Σss),then it is possible to take the corresponding partition of the set of alternatives,X=I1∪I2∪…∪Is.Consequently, the original profileM∈MN×Kcan be rewritten likeM=(MI1,MI2,…,MIs). ThenδΣ(M)=∑i=1sδΣii(MIi).Adding alternatives. Anextension of a profileM∈MN×kis a new profile,M*∈MN×(k+r),such that M* includes r new alternatives. Under this assumption, M* can be seen as a profile with two subgroups, the initial and the new alternatives,M*=(M,Mnew)∈MN×(k+r). If the aforementioned subgroups of alternatives are not related then Property 5 applies. Consequently,δΣ*(M*)=δΣ(M)+δΣnew(Mnew)whereΣ*=(Σ00Σnew)andΣnew∈Mr×ris the associated matrix to the dissensus measure for the r new alternatives.In the particular case where all the new alternatives added to the profile M are evaluated equally by all agents,δΣ*(M*)=δΣ(M),irrespective of Σnewbecause unanimous profiles produce dissensus measures equal to zero. This particular case is defined like a property called “independence of irrelevant alternatives” in Alcantud, de Andrés Calle, and Cascón (2013a).Adding agents to the society. Suppose that a new agent is added to the society, and then the Mahalonabis dissensus measure of the enlarged society does not decrease. In addition, the increment is minimal when the“average agent” is added up. Formally:LetM∈MN×kbe a profile andM¯∈M(N+1)×kbe its expansion after incorporating the evaluations of a new agent. The Mahalanobis dissensus measure forM¯isδΣ(M¯)=N−1N+1·δΣ(M)+1CN+12·∑i=1NdΣ(Mi,M¯N+1)whereM¯N+1is the row ofM¯which incorporates the new agent’s assessments for the alternatives.If the assessments of the new agent coincide with the average of the original agents’ evaluations for each alternative, then the minimal increment of the dissensus measure is obtained.Remark 2A particular case is when the Mahalanobis dissensus measure is zero, or equivalently, there exits unanimity. If we include a new agent whose evaluations coincide with the assessments of the original agents, the Mahalanobis dissensus measure continues being zero.In practical situations we could potentially use various Mahalanobis dissensus measures for profiles of cardinal information.55This is the case of our real example in Section 5 below.Hence it is worth studying the relations among evaluations achieved when we vary the reference matrices. This section addresses this point.Theorems 1 and 2 below identify conditions on matrices that ensure consistent comparisons between Mahalanobis dissensus measures, whatever the number of agents. Based on these theorems, a final result gives bounds for the Mahalanobis dissensus measure.Along this sectionΣ1,Σ2∈Mk×kdenote two positive definite matrices anddΣ1,dΣ2denote the corresponding Mahalanobis (squared) distances onRkassociated to Σ1 and Σ2. Letλ1(i)≥λ2(i)≥⋯≥λk(i)>0be the eigenvalues of Σi,i=1,2.Theorem 1If there exists N for which each profileM∈MN×kverifiesδΣ1(M)≥δΣ2(M)then(2)λi(1)≤λi(2)fori=1,…,kWe take a profileM∈Mk×kwithMi=0fori=2,3,…,NandM1=x∈Rk.By assumptionδΣ1(M)=1CN2·dΣ1(x,0)≥δΣ2(M)=1CN2·dΣ2(x,0).Consequently, the hypothesis is reduced todΣ1(x,0)≥dΣ2(x,0)forx∈Rk. It meansxΣ1−1xt≥xΣ2−1xt⇒x(Σ1−1−Σ2−1)xt≥0forx∈Rk.Then(Σ1−1−Σ2−1)is a non-negative definite matrix. Now we use the result included in Appendix B (see Point 11) to finish the proof:Σ1−1≥Σ2−1⟹1λi(1)≥1λi(2)⟹λi(1)≤λi(2)fori=1,2,…,k.□The converse of Theorem 1 is not always true like Example 2 below shows. Nevertheless, Theorem 2 below proves that a partial converse of Theorem 1 holds true under a technical restriction on the definite matrices.Example 2Let us consider a particular case of two matricesΣ1=(0.18−0.16−0.160.42)Σ2=(0.600.200.200.30)whose eigenvalues verifyλi(1)≤λi(2)fori=1,2becauseλ1(1)=0.5,λ2(1)=0.1andλ1(2)=0.7,λ2(2)=0.2.LetM∈M2×2be the profileM=(46000). The Mahalanobis dissensus measures for M associated with Σ1 and Σ2 produceδΣ1(M)=14630.4≤14777.14=δΣ2(M).Therefore it is not true thatδΣ1(M)≥δΣ2(M)holds throughout.IfΣ1,Σ2∈Mk×kare commutable matrices and their eigenvalues verifyλ1(1)≤λk(2)thenδΣ1(M)≥δΣ2(M)for each size N and each profileM∈MN×k.AssumingΣ1,Σ2∈Mk×kare commutable, we can apply Point 12 in Appendix B toΣ1−1andΣ2−1. Consequently, there exists an orthonormal matrixQ∈Mk×ksuch thatQtΣ1−1Q=D1andQtΣ2−1Q=D2beingD1,D2∈Mk×kdiagonal matrices. It is possible to select Q in such a way that the diagonal elements of D1 verify1λ1(1)≤⋯≤1λk(1). ThusD1=diag(1λ1(1),…,1λk(1))andD2=diag(1λπ(1)(2),…,1λπ(k)(2)),where π is a permutation of{1,2,…,k}.66When Q does not lead to a diagonal matrix with properly ordered eigenvalues, we change Q forQ′=QPt,P being a permutation matrix. Q′ is also an orthogonal matrix (see Appendix B, Point 10) which simultaneously diagonalizesΣ1−1andΣ2−1. In addition, we get a diagonal matrixD1*with the same eigenvalues that D1 but in the proper order.Letx,y∈Rkbe two row vectors. Since Q is an orthonormal matrix, there exists a vectorz∈Rksuch that(x−y)t=QzdΣ1(x,y)=(x−y)Σ1−1(x−y)t=ztQtΣ1−1Qz=ztD1z=∑j=1k1λj(1)zj2dΣ2(x,y)=(x−y)Σ2−1(x−y)t=ztQtΣ2−1Qz=ztD2z=∑j=1k1λπ(j)(2)zj2From premise thatλ1(1)≤λk(2)we have1λk(1)≥⋯≥1λ1(1)≥1λk(2)≥⋯≥1λ1(2).Thus1λj(1)≥1λπ(j)(2)forj=1,2,…,kand as a result it is obtained∑j=1k1λj(1)zj2≥∑j=1k1λπ(j)(2)zj2.In consequence,dΣ1(x,y)≥dΣ2(x,y).Now, using Definition 3 the theorem is proven.□Example 3 below shows the relevance of hypothesis on the eigenvalues (Theorem 2).Example 3Considering Σ1 and Σ2 from Example 2, we observe that they are commutable matrices:Σ1Σ2=(0.18−0.16−0.160.42)(0.60.20.20.3)=(0.076−0.012−0.0120.094)Σ2Σ1=(0.60.20.20.3)(0.18−0.16−0.160.42)=(0.076−0.012−0.0120.094)We can see that the assumptionλ1(1)≤λk(2)even ifk=2does not implyλi(1)≤λi(2)fori=1,2(see Eq. (2), Theorem 1):λ1(1)=0.5<0.7=λ1(2),λ2(1)=0.1<0.2=λ2(2),λ1(1)=0.5>0.2=λ2(2).Example 4 bellow reveals that the commutativity of Σ1 and Σ2 is not superfluous in the statement of Theorem 2.Example 4Let us considerΣ1=(0.05000.1)andΣ2=(0.60.20.20.3),withλ2(1)=0.05,λ1(1)=0.1andλ2(2)=0.2,λ1(2)=0.7. These eigenvalues satisfyλ1(1)≤λ2(2)and Σ1 and Σ2 matrices are not commutable:Σ1Σ2=(0.030.010.020.03)≠(0.030.020.010.03)=Σ2Σ1LetM∈M2×2be a specific profile,M=(46000). The Mahalanobis dissensus measures for M associated with Σ1 and Σ2 produceδΣ1(M)=360.8≤14,777.14=δΣ2(M). Therefore it is not true thatδΣ1(M)≥δΣ2(M)holds throughout.Theorems 1 and 2 can be extended to r positive definite matricesΣ1,…,Σras a matter of course.Apart from Theorems 1 and 2, the following corollary reveals that the Mahalanobis dissensus measure associated to Σ is confined within bounds depending only on the extreme eigenvalues of Σ.Corollary 1LetΣ∈Mk×kbe a positive definite matrix with eigenvalues λ1 ≥ ⋅⋅⋅ ≥ λk, it is verifiedδλ1I(M)≤δΣ(M)≤δλkI(M)or equivalently1λ1·δI(M)≤δΣ(M)≤1λk·δI(M)for each N and for eachM∈MN×k.This result is straightforward from Theorem 2. Observe that such Theorem can be applied because λkI (resp., λ1I) and M are commutable matrices and the eigenvalues of the diagonal matrix λkI (resp., λ1I) are all equal to λk(resp. λ1). Proposition 2 is used.□Fig. 1 illustrates the previous corollary regarding the distances used forδλ1I,δΣandδλkI. We can observe that all points on the ellipse have the same Mahalanobis distance to point A, namely dΣ. Moreover, distance dΣis always between the values of the corresponding distancesdλ1IanddλkI.In this section we fully develop a real example. It aims at giving an explicit application of our proposal and discussing some of its features.We are interested in assessing the cohesiveness of the forecasts of various magnitudes for the Spanish Economy in 2014: GDP (Gross Domestic Product), Unemployment Rate, Public Deficit, Public Debt and Inflation. These forecasts have been published by different institutions and organizations, and each one was made at around the same time. Specifically, three waves of forecasts were published in the Spring of 2013 (Table 1), Autumn of 2013 (Table 2) and Spring of 2014 (Table 3).We intend to measure the cohesiveness of the aforementioned predictions. Since they are expressed by cardinal valuations, we need to go beyond the traditional analyses referred to in this paper. To this purpose, we first gather the data corresponding to Tables 1–3 in the profilesM(S),M(A),M(lS)∈M5×5,respectively. Next, we select a suitable reference matrix and finally we make the computations of the Mahalanobis dissensus measures.Once the profiles have been fixed, the following step to compute their Mahalanobis dissensus measures is to avail oneself of a suitable reference matrix Σ. The choice of such a matrix can easily raise controversy. Nevertheless, we can learn from the role of the Σ matrix in the Mahalanobis distance from a statistical point of view. This matrix contains the variances and covariances among the statistical variables, therefore, those characteristics are brought into play in this distance. We recall that covariances (or corresponding correlations) among variables reveal their interdependence. In statistics, this Σ matrix is usually unknown and it is estimated from a sample. One exception is the unlikely case when the data are generated by a known multivariate probability distribution. This is not the case of our example.Therefore we employ a reference matrix Σ that captures the variances and covariances among the macroeconomic magnitudes of the Spanish Economy. It seems natural to produce such a matrix from historical macroeconomic data corresponding to the issues under inspection. Table 4contains such recorded data, and Table 5gives the corresponding correlation coefficients.77Given two vectorsX=(x1,…,xn)′andY=(y1,…,yn)′withx¯andy¯their respective means, the correlation coefficient between X and Y is computed bycor(X,Y)=∑i=1n(xi−x¯)(yi−y¯)∑i=1n(xi−x¯)2∑i=1n(yi−y¯)2.These values are depicted in Fig. 2. Each ellipse represents the correlation between a pair of variables. The ellipses slant upward (resp., downward) show a positive (resp., negative) correlation. Moreover, the narrower the ellipse the stronger correlation represented. For example, the pair formed by GDP and Public Deficit holds the strongest negative correlation.On the basis of Table 4, we compute the corresponding variance-covariance matrixΣ88Let X be a n × k matrix whose columns have meansX¯i,i=1,…,k. The cells of the variance-covariance matrix areΣij=1n−1∑r=1n(xri−X¯i)(xrj−X¯j)..Σ=(6.11−11.49−12.43−20.192.03−11.4932.7428.4372.42−2.97−12.4328.4328.4155.41−3.60−20.1972.4255.41190.52−4.732.03−2.97−3.60−4.731.28)Now we calculate the Mahalanobis dissensus measures associated withΣfor the profiles of the forecasts for the Spanish Economy, namely, M(S), M(A) and M(lS).We obtain the following Mahalanobis dissensus measures associated with the aforementionedΣ:δΣ(M(S))=8.45,δΣ(M(A))=2.05,δΣ(M(lS))=1.51.Note that the measure of the dissensus decreases along the time. This is what we intuitively expect, since the latter forecasts rest on more accurate and factual information.Apart from the measure of the cohesiveness of the profiles, our proposal also produces a measure of divergence among the evaluations of different agents on a set of issues. We can answer questions like “Are the predictions of the European Commission for the Spanish Economy similar to the predictions of the BBVA Reseach?” or “Is the previous comparison more or less similar than the comparison between the predictions of the BBVA Research vs. the predictions of the IMF?”. Table 6provides these items for comparison.The choice of the reference matrix is a key point in the application of the Mahalanobis dissensus measure. As an explanatory exercise in this subsection we discuss on the more simplistic approaches where naive reference matrices are employed. If we use the identity matrix as the reference matrix (for example, because we lack data to make a better inference), then we get a Mahalanobis dissensus measure which gives the same importance to the differences in all the issues (see Section 3.1). However the choice of the identity matrix as the reference matrix discards much relevant information. We note the variance of the Public Debt is 190.52, while Inflation has a variance of 1.28 (seeΣ). So, a difference of one unit in the forecasts from two agents does not signify the same if such a difference corresponds to Inflation or to Public Debt.We could alternatively employ as the reference matrix, the diagonal matrix with the variances of the issues, that is,Σσ=diag(6.11,32.74,28.41,190.52,1.28).In this case, we remove the effects of the interdependence among the economic magnitudes on the dissensus measure.In order to check that an inconvenient choice of the reference matrix easily produces misleading conclusions. Table 7shows the dissensus measures derived from the three matrices mentioned above,Σ,I andΣσ. The dissensus δΣis decreasing along time as previously reported. This intuitively appealing feature is not captured when we utilize simpler matrices. Consequently, introducing corrections due to variances or to cross-effects is crucial for a reliable final analysis.We explore the problem of measuring the degree of cohesiveness in a setting where experts express their opinions on alternatives or issues by means of cardinal evaluations. We use the general concept of dissensus measure and introduce one particular formulation based on the Mahalanobis distance for numerical vectors, namely the Mahalanobis dissensus measure.We provide some properties which make our proposal appealing. We emphasize that the Mahalanobis dissensus measure on the profiles with k issues or alternatives is scale-independent for each issue and it accounts for cross-relations of issues. In addition, the comparison between different Mahalanobis dissensus measures can be made through the eigenvalues of their associated matrices.We illustrate our proposal with a real numerical application about forecasts for several magnitudes for the Spanish Economy. We discuss the relevance of the choice of the reference matrix in this context.
