This paper presents a novel motion planning algorithm for modular robots moving in environments with diverse terrain conditions. This requires the planner to generate a suitable control signal for all actuators, which can be computationally intensive. To decrease the complexity of the planning task, the concept of motion primitives is used. The motion primitives generate simple motions like ‘crawl-forward’ or ‘turn-left’ and the motion planner constructs a plan using these primitives. To preserve the efficiency and robustness of the planner on varying terrains, a novel schema called RRT-AMP (Rapidly Exploring Random Trees with Adaptive Motion Primitives) for adapting the motion primitives is introduced. The adaptation procedure is integrated into the planning process, which allows the planner simultaneously to adapt the primitives and to use them to obtain the final plan. Besides adaptation in changing environments, RRT-AMP can adapt motion primitives if some module fails. The methods is experimentally verified with robots of different morphologies to show its adaptation and planning abilities in complex environments.Modular robots consist of many interconnected mechatronic modules. Depending on the hardware architecture, the modules can be equipped with various motion actuators, basic sensors, a communication bus and a simple processing unit [1]. In comparison to conventional fixed-shape robots, which are usually built for performing a specific task, modular robots are more flexible, as they can be reconfigured to various shapes according to the current application. Moreover, they are fault tolerant and able to self-repair. Modular robots may bring additional abilities in various applications, e.g. in search & rescue missions [2], space exploration [3] or object manipulation [4]. For example, in the search & rescue scenario, where the task is to find a victim after a disaster, a quadruped modular robot can be used for efficient motion over a complex terrain. When the robot needs to pass a narrow space, it can reconfigure to a snake-like robot. Beside the ability to form robots of various shapes, the advantage of modular robots stands in the possibility of changing failed modules, as they can be simply disconnected from the complex organism and replaced by new ones.The individual modules can move using various actuators like wheels, belts [5] or even screw-drives [6]. The modular robots utilize two different concepts of movements: a joint-control and a self-reconfiguration. In the joint-control approach, which is considered in this paper, the locomotion of the robot is achieved by controlling the joints connecting the modules [7]. In the concept of self-reconfiguration, the locomotion is achieved by disconnection and reconnection of the modules [8–12]. This presents completely new type of motion which cannot be seen in the nature. It can be applied in situations where the joint-control approach cannot be used.The joint-control locomotion can be realized using a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) [13], which produces periodic control signals for the actuators. Although the CPGs can be very effective to produce a desired gait, a global navigation over a large scene with complex obstacles and varying terrain usually require multiple gaits that are switched using a motion planner [14]. To ensure that the robot can move in environments with altering terrain conditions or even when some modules fail, the utilized locomotion gaits have to be adapted.In this paper, we address the problem of finding a trajectory of a modular robot between different locations in a complex environment. To find the trajectory, the RRT-MP [14] algorithm is utilized. The original RRT-MP employs a vocabulary of fixed motion primitives. The main contribution of this paper is the novel approach for adaptation of the motion primitives, called RRT-AMP (RRT with Adaptive Motion Primitives). Beside the ability to design motion plans in environments with varying terrain types, the novel adaptation mechanism allows the robot to recover after a module fails.The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the related work is summarized. The notation and description of motion primitives used in the rest of the paper is described in Section 3. Section 4 describes the method for optimization of motion primitives. The utilization of these primitives in the RRT-MP planner is described in Section 5 and the novel adaptation mechanism in Section 6. Section 7 describes implementation details. Experimental verification of the proposed methods is introduced in Section 8.
