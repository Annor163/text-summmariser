@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We study the Cournot competition between two supply chains that are subject to supply uncertainty. Each supply chain consists of a retailer and an exclusive supplier which has random yield. We examine how the levels of supply uncertainty and competition intensity affect the equilibrium decisions of ordering quantity, contract offering, and centralization choice. We show that a retailer should order more if its competing retailer’s supply becomes less reliable or if its own supply becomes more reliable. A supply chain with reliable supply can take great advantage of the high supply risk of its competing chain. Furthermore, for decentralized chains we characterize the optimal wholesale price contracts with linear penalty, under different supply risks and competition scenarios. Finally, we show that supply chain centralization is a dominant strategy, and it always makes the customers better off. Nevertheless, if the supply risk is low and the chain competition is intensive, centralization could actually decrease the supply chain profit, compared with the case where both chains do not choose centralization. This results in a prisoner’s dilemma. On the other hand, if the supply risk is high and/or the competition level is low, centralization always increases the supply chain profit. The desirability of supply chain centralization is enhanced by high supply uncertainty or low chain competition.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Due to fast development of information technology and more intense global competition, firms are cooperating more closely than ever to optimize their supply chains. As a result, the traditional model of firm to firm competition is giving way to a new paradigm of supply chain to supply chain competition in the market place (Barnes, 2006; Ha and Tong, 2008).Meanwhile, supply uncertainty has become a major concern for global supply chain management. Supply uncertainty may be caused by various reasons, such as natural disasters, labor strikes, custom delays, terrorist attacks, changes in government regulation, etc. An industrial survey conducted by Protiviti and APICS (American Production and Inventory Control Society) showed that 66 percent of respondents considered supply interruption one of their most significant concerns among all supply chain related risks (O’Keeffe, 2006).This paper offers a systematic examination of how to design and operate supply chains to effectively deal with supply uncertainty and supply chain competition. In particular, we study the interaction between two competing supply chains. Each chain consists of one retailer and its exclusive supplier. Both chains are subject to supply uncertainty, i.e., the supplier may not be able to fulfill the retailer’s order due to exogenous causes.There are many real-life examples of supply chain to supply chain competition, where supply risk is also an important issue. Take the dairy industry in China as an example. The industry has experienced rapid growth in recent years. The market was worth $40.6 billion in 2013, compared with only $20.7 billion in 2008. The two largest national players, Yili Group and China Mengniu Dairy Company Ltd., had a combined market share of 41 percent in 2012, leaving the other players far behind. The uncertainty of high-quality milk supply presents great challenges to their dairy supply chain management (e.g., the notorious 2008 milk contamination scandal). Both companies source from independent and exclusive farms, but they are investing more heavily on establishing their own farms domestically and internationally in recent years (Sharma and Zhang, 2014; Zhang, 2014).Retailers often sell substitutable products in environments with end-market competition, where the products market prices depend primarily on their output quantities in the market. In such competing environments, supply uncertainty may exacerbate the competition between supply chains. For example, Canon and Nikon are the two largest players in the digital single lens reflex (SLR) camera market. In 2011, a large earthquake in Japan forced some Japan-based semiconductor manufacturers to halt production as a result of rolling blackouts, impassable roads, and limited fuel supplies. It led to the shortage of sensor, flash memories and so on, which affected Canon and Nikon’s total production output and the market prices for the competing end-products (Canon, 2011; Lucero, 2011; Miserere, 2011; Nikon, 2011).In our paper, we focus on the Cournot supply chain competition where the market price is determined by the total quantity in the market, and investigate how supply risks, competition intensity, and supply chain structures may affect firms’ operational strategies. Specifically, we aim at addressing the following research questions:•How does supply uncertainty and supply chain competition affect the ordering decisions?How to determine the wholesale price and shortage penalty in a decentralized supply chain?Does supply chain centralization provide a competitive advantage when dealing with competition and supply uncertainty?We consider three different market structures: (i) both supply chains are centralized (referred to as Centralized Competition); (ii) one supply chain is centralized while the other is decentralized (referred to as Hybrid Competition); and (iii) both supply chains are decentralized (referred to as Decentralized Competition). We derive the equilibrium decisions for each game in terms of the retailer ordering quantity and (for a decentralized chain) the contract terms. By comparing the three equilibria, we examine the value of centralization.For the optimal ordering decisions, we show that a retailer should order more if its competing retailer’s supply becomes less reliable or if its own supply becomes more reliable. That is, a retailer with reliable supply can take great opportunity of its competing chain’s high supply risk. We also show how the total market supply and price are affected by supply uncertainty and the intensity of chain competition. In addition, we show how to optimally design the wholesale-price contract with shortage penalty in a decentralized supply chain, under different supply risks and competition scenarios.Furthermore, we show that supply chain centralization is the dominant strategy under supply uncertainty and chain-to-chain competition. Nevertheless, supply chain centralization may not always result in positive gains for the supply chain itself. In fact, we show that if supply risk is low and competition intensity is high, centralization could actually decrease supply chain profit, comparing with the case where both chains are decentralized, which results in a prisoner’s dilemma. On the other hand, if supply risk is high or competition level is small, centralization always increases the supply chain profit. In other words, the desirability of supply chain centralization is enhanced by high supply uncertainty and/or low supply chain competition.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 describes the model. Section 4 investigates the ordering and contract design decisions under three different game settings: the Centralized Competition Game, the Hybrid Competition Game, and the Decentralized Competition Game. Section 5 compares the three equilibria from Section 4 and examines the strategic choice of supply chain centralization. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.Our study is closely related to three areas: supply uncertainty, supply chain contracting, and supply chain competition.The existing work on supply uncertainty can be divided into three categories: (i) the random-yield model, which models the uncertainty by assuming that the supply level is a random function of the input level (e.g., Yano and Lee, 1995; Gerchak and Parlar, 1990; Parlar and Wang, 1993; Swaminathan and Shanthikumar, 1999; Kazaz, 2004; Babich, Ritchken, and Burnetas, 2007; Federgruen and Yang, 2008; Wang, Gilland, and Tomlin, 2008; Kazaz, 2008; Deo and Corbett, 2009; Gao, Li, and Shou, 2014), (ii) the stochastic lead-time model, which models the lead-time as a random variable (see a comprehensive review in Zipkin, 2000), and (iii) the supply disruption model, which typically models the uncertainty of a supplier as one of two states: “up” or “down” (e.g., Arreola-Risa and DeCroix, 1998; Gupta, 1996; Meyer, Rothkopf, and Smith, 1979; Parlar and Berkin, 1991; Song and Zipkin, 1996; Tomlin, 2006; Snyder and Shen, 2006; Yang, Aydin, Babich, and Beil, 2009; Shou, Xiong, and Shen, 2013). Specifically, for the supply disruption model, the orders are fulfilled on time and in full when the supplier is “up,” and no order can be fulfilled when the supplier is “down”. Our proposed research builds upon the random yield model.Conflict of interest is ubiquitous in a supply chain, and contracts are widely used to resolve these conflicts. The key task in supply contract design is to align the objectives of the various firms with the supply chain’s overall objective, and thereby reduce the inefficiency of the supply chain. Cachon (2003) provides an excellent review of this field. There are several papers addressing contracting and competition simultaneously, e.g., Parlar (1988), Cachon (2001), Corbett and Karmarkar (2001), Carr and Karmarkar (2005), Boyaci and Gallego (2004), and Ha and Tong (2008). In particular, Carr and Karmarkar (2005) examined quantity competition under different supply chain structures with deterministic demand. Boyaci and Gallego (2004) studied two competing supply chains where the manufacturers and the retailers could act to affect service quality, and examined the value of centralization given full information. They showed that centralization is the dominant strategy, but it reduces supply chain profit, presenting a prisoner’s dilemma. Ha and Tong (2008) investigated two competing supply chains where only the retailers could act to directly affect market competition. They studied the value of information sharing and the corresponding contracting choices. However, none of these papers considered supply risks in a competitive environment.A good number of researchers have investigated supply chain structures in a competitive environment, e.g. Anderson and Bao (2010); McGuire and Staelin (1983); Moorthy (1988). McGuire and Staelin (1983) were the first one to study various supply chain structures, including a mixed structure with one centralized channel and one decentralized channel. They examined Nash Equilibrium and dominant structures in different situations, and showed that in the highly competitive market, the manufacturers prefer to use decentralized system. This was a very interesting result, since in a single supply chain a centralized system usually performers better than a decentralized system because of “double marginalization” (Cachon, 2003; Ru and Wang, 2010; Spengler, 1950). Based on the model of McGuire and Staelin (1983), Moorthy (1988) provided the reason for decentralization to be a Nash Equilibrium strategy as “the nature of the coupling between demand dependence and strategic dependence”. Anderson and Bao (2010) derived that whether decentralized system outperforms centralized system depends on the coefficient of variation of these market shares. Wu, Baron, and Berman (2009) considered three strategies, Vertical Integration, Manufacturer’s Stackelberg, and Bargaining on the Wholesale price, in two supply chain competition with demand uncertainty. They demonstrated that (1) in one period model, Vertical Integration is the unique Nash Equilibrium for both supply chains; and (2) over infinitely many periods, Manufacturer’s Stackelberg or Bargaining on the Wholesale price may become the Nash Equilibrium.There are a few papers in operations management that study chain-to-chain competition. Demirag, Keskinocak, and Swann (2011) studied the performance of customer rebate and retailer incentive promotions under chain-to-chain competition, and showed that customer rebates can be more profitable for the manufacturers under some cases in the presence of supply chain competition, which is different from the monopoly case where the manufacturers are always better off with retailer incentives. Ha, Tong, and Zhang (2011) analyzed Cournot and Bertrand competition of two supply chains each consisting of one manufacturer selling to one exclusive retailer, and investigated the impact of production diseconomy, information (signal) accuracy, competition intensity, and competition type between supply chains on the demand information sharing incentive. Fang, Shou, Wang, and Hua (2013) focused on the equilibrium contracting strategies between consignment contract and wholesale-price contract in supply chain to supply chain competition under price-sensitive stochastic demand. However, very few papers have considered the effects of supply uncertainty in a competitive environment.Motivated by the case of the U.S. influenza vaccine market, Deo and Corbett (2009), which is closely related to our study, examined the interaction between supply uncertainty and a firm’s strategic decision regarding market entry. They found that, in an equilibrium state, supply uncertainty can lead to a high number of firms concentrating in an industry as well as a reduction in the industry output and the expected consumer surplus. Deo and Corbett (2009) assumed same supply uncertainty levels and perfect competition between firms, while in this paper we consider a more general model with different supply risks, different competition intensities, and different supply chain structures. Furthermore, they focused on the question of market entry, which is very different from our study. Babich et al. (2007) studied a supply chain where one retailer does business with competing high-risk suppliers that may default during their production lead times. They show that low supplier default correlations dampen competition between the suppliers and increase the equilibrium wholesale prices. Therefore, the retailer prefers suppliers with highly correlated default events, despite consequently losing the benefits of diversification. In contrast, the suppliers and the channel retailer prefer negatively correlated defaults. Hopp, Iravani, and Liu (2008) investigated the impact of regional supply disruption on competing supply chains where the firms’ strategies consist of two stages: (i) preparation, investing in measures that facilitate quick detection of a problem prior to a disruption, and (ii) response, post-disruption purchasing of backup capacity for components with compromised availability. As a measure of risk, they used the expected loss of profit due to lack of preparedness, and they found that the products that pose the greatest risk are those with valuable market share, low customer loyalty, and relatively limited backup capacity. Furthermore, they showed that a dominant firm in such a market should focus primarily on protecting its market share, while a weaker firm should focus on being ready to take advantage of a supply disruption to gain market share.Our paper differs from the above-mentioned papers (i.e., Deo and Corbett, 2009; Babich et al., 2007; Hopp et al., 2008) in that we focus on the ordering decisions, contract design, and centralization choices given supply uncertainty and supply chain competition. We contribute to the literature by offering a systematic examination of how to design and operate supply chains to effectively deal with supply risks and competition.To investigate the impact of supply uncertainty and supply chain competition, we consider the model presented in Fig. 1.There are two competing supply chains that offer the same product in the market. Each chain consists of a retailer and an exclusive supplier. All parties are risk neutral. The two supply chains, suppliers, and retailers are indexed by i and j, where i, j ∈ {1, 2}, i ≠ j. The retailers compete on quantity.The suppliers are subject to supply uncertainty. The uncertainty may be caused by natural disasters, labor strikes, transportation disruption, etc., which are considered to be out of control by the suppliers and the retailers. If retailer i places an order of Qi, he would receive αiQiwhere αiis a random variable between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The mean and standard deviation of αiis μiand σi. We use coefficient of variation (CV), δi= σi/μi, to measure the level of supply uncertainty: the larger δi, the more uncertainty. We consider the general case where the two suppliers may have different uncertainty levels.The product has a short life cycle, thus both supply chains have only one ordering opportunity. The market price of the product is determined as pi(Qi, Qj) = A − αiQi− γαjQj, where the positive constant A represents the market size and γ ∈ [0, 1] measures the competitive intensity. In the extreme cases, when γ = 1 the two products are perfectly substitutable; when γ = 0 the two products are completely different. This pricing function is widely used in quantity competition papers (e.g., Ha and Tong, 2008).We consider two marginal costs for each supply chain i: (i) C1iper unit of production quantity, and (ii) C2iper unit of successful delivery. If supplier i produces an order of Qiand the yield is αiQi, the expected total cost is E(C1iQi+ C2iαiQi) = C1iQi+ C2iμiQi. To simplify the notation, we define Ci= C1i/μi+ C2i. Hence, the expected total cost becomes CiμiQi. To exclude the non-interesting case where neither party sells to the market, we assume A > Ci. We consider the general case where the two chains may have different costs.We assume that the retailers have no option for backup (contingent) sourcing, that the supply uncertainty is independent of each other, and that all parties have full information about the entire market.In this section we examine the optimal ordering and contract design decisions under three settings. First, we derive the equilibrium for the centralized competition game between two centralized chains. Second, we derive the equilibrium for the hybrid competition game between a centralized chain and a decentralized chain. Finally, we derive the equilibrium for the decentralized competition game between two decentralized chains. Comparisons between the three settings and insights into the strategic decisions are provided in Section 5.We first consider the case in which both supply chains are centralized, i.e., the retailer and the supplier in each chain are fully aligned (integrated) to achieve the whole supply chain’s optimal performance. We use a central planner i (i = 1, 2) to represent the supplier and the retailer in each chain. We seek to derive the equilibrium order quantity,Qi*andQj*,of each central planner and examine how they are affected by supply uncertainty and supply chain competition.The sequence of events is as follows:1.Ordering decision: central planners i and j decide the order quantity Qiand Qjsimultaneously.Uncertain supply: central planner i receives αiQiand central planner j receives αjQj.Quantity competition: the market is cleared based on the total realized products from both supply chains and each party receives the payoff.The goal of the central planner i is to maximize the expected profit for supply chain i, which can be expressed as follows:(1)E(πi)=E(piαiQi−C1iQi−C2iαiQi)=E(piαiQi)−CiμiQi=E[(A−αiQi−γαjQj)αiQi]−CiμiQi=(A−Ci)μiQi−(μi2+σi2)Qi2−γμiμjQiQj,whereE[αi]=μi,Var[αi]=σi2,E[αi2]=μi2+σi2and Ci= C1i/μi+ C2i.The following theorem characterizes the unique pure strategy equilibrium and the corresponding players’ payoffs for the Centralized Competition Game. For notation convenience, we denote Ki= A − Ci, Kj= A − Cj, and λ = Ki/Kjfor the rest of the paper. λ implies the cost differences between the two chains. λ < 1 means that the cost of supply chain i is lower than that of j.Theorem 1The unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the Centralized Competition Game is(Qi*,Qj*),where the optimal order quantities of supply chains are(i)whenγ2(1+δj2)<λ<2(1+δi2)γ,(2)Qi*=2(1+δj2)Ki−γKjμi(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2),(3)Qj*=2(1+δi2)Kj−γKiμj(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2),whenλ≤γ2(1+δj2),(4)Qi*=0,(5)Qj*=Kj2μj(1+δj2),whenλ≥2(1+δi2)γ,(6)Qi*=Ki2μi(1+δi2),(7)Qj*=0.Note that as we assume Ki> 0 and Kj> 0, we exclude the trivial case ofQi*=Qj*=0.All proofs are provided in the Appendix A. Let us first look at the special case where there is no supply uncertainty (μi= μj= 1, δi= δj= 0), two products are perfect substitutable (γ = 1) and the costs are the same (Ci= Cj= C). In this case, the Centralized Competition Game degenerates into a standard Cournot duopoly game, and the optimal order quantities becomeQi*=Qj*=(A−C)/3and the expected profits become (A − C)2/9, which are consistent with the classical results.Now we examine the impact of supply uncertainties on the order quantities. Based on Theorem 1, we show that the following is true.Corollary 1When λ is small or large (i.e.,λ≤γ2(1+δj2)orλ≥2(1+δi2)γ), the market has only one monopoly chain, whose optimal order quantity and expected profit decrease when its supply uncertainty increases. When λ is medium (i.e.,γ2(1+δj2)<λ<2(1+δi2)γ), both chains sell to the market and the equilibrium order quantity and expected profit for supply chain i increase in δjand decrease in δi.Corollary 1 says that one supply chain’s order quantity and expected profit increase when the supply uncertainty of the competing chain increases, and decrease when its own supply uncertainty increases. Note that in the special case when Ci= Cj, γ = 1 and δi= δj, Corollary 1 echoes the finding in Lemma 1 of Deo and Corbett (2009) when there are two firms: the order quantities of chains i and j are identical and decrease in the yield uncertainty δ. Here we provide more general results for cases where the costs and yield uncertainties of two chains are different.Figs. 2and 3 present some numerical examples to illustrate how a supply chain’s expected supply and profit change with respect to its own supply uncertainty level and that of the competing supply chain. For the purpose of illustration, we let Ci= Cj= C, γ = 1. We also normalize (A − C) to 1, without loss of generality. The horizontal axis in both figures is the uncertainty level of supply chain j, δj. In Fig 2the vertical axis is the expected order quantity of supply chain i, E(αiQi) = μiQi, whereas in Fig. 3 the vertical axis is the expected profit of supply chain i. The four curves represent different uncertainty levels for supply chain i, with δi= 0, 0.5, 1, 2, which represents cases when the supply risk is absent, low, medium, and high, respectively. The main observations are as follows:•For a given uncertainty level δi, the expected order quantity and profit of supply chain i increase as its competing supply chain’s uncertainty level δjincreases. That is, a supply chain can take great opportunity of its competing chain’s supply risk. For example, if supply chain i has perfect supply (i.e., δi= 0), when the uncertainty of supply chain j (δj) increases from 0 to 2, supply chain i’s expected supply increases by 38 percent and the expected profit increases by 96 percent.Given a fixed uncertainty level for the competing supply chain, the expected order quantity and profit of supply chain i decreases as its own uncertainty level increases. For example, assuming that the uncertainty level of supply chain j is fixed at δj= 1, while the uncertainty of supply chain i (δi) increases from 0.5 to 1, supply chain i’s expected supply decreases by 40 percent and the expected profit decreases by 42 percent.As a supply chain’s uncertainty level becomes very large, its expected supply becomes very small, and the competing supply chain behaves more like a monopoly player. In fact, we can analytically prove thatQi*≤(A−C)/2=0.5andE(πi*)≤(A−C)2/4=0.25,i.e., the optimal order quantities and the expected profits with supply uncertainty are upper-bounded by the order quantities and the profits for the standard monopoly game without supply uncertainty.Next, we examine the impact of competitive intensity γ on the optimal order quantities and expected profits. We have the following corollary:Corollary 2When the two competing supply chains have same costs and both sell to the market (i.e., λ = 1 andγ2(1+δj2)<1<2(1+δi2)γ), the equilibrium order quantity and expected profit for supply chain i decrease in γ. That is, higher competition leads to lower equilibrium order quantities and expected profits for both supply chains.The proof of the corollary is by looking at the first-order derivatives of Eqs. (2) and (3). Details are shown in the Appendix A. The next corollary shows the impact of supply uncertainty and competitive intensity on the expected total market supply, denoted as T = E(αiQi+ αjQj).Corollary 3When both chains sell to the market, the expected total market supply at the Nash equilibrium for the Centralized Competition Game is(8)T*=μiQi*+μjQj*=(2(1+δj2)−γ)Ki+(2(1+δi2)−γ)Kj4δi2+4δj2+4δi2δj2+4−γ2The expected total market supply decreases in δi, δj, and γ.In this section, we study the case where one supply chain is centralized while the other is not. We show how to design the optimal wholesale-price contract for the decentralized chain. We seek to understand how the equilibrium order quantities and the profits change, comparing with the Centralized Competition Game. In addition, we are also interested in discovering whether the centralized chain has a competitive edge over the decentralized chain in this Hybrid Competition Game.Without loss of generality, we assume that supply chain i is centralized and that supply chain j is decentralized. We use superscript “h” to denote the Hybrid Competition Game. The expected profit of supply chain i is(9)E(πih)=E(piαiQih−C1iQih−C2iαiQih)=(A−Ci)μiQih−Qih2(μi2+σi2)−γQihQjhμiμj.For supply chain j, we assume that the supplier charges the retailer a wholesale price ωjper unit of successful delivery, and pays the retailer a penalty sjper unit of unfilled order. This is a linear contract that is easy to implement and is widely adopted in practice. The expected profit of retailer j is:(10)E(πj,rh)=E[(pj−wj)αjQjh+sj(1−αj)Qjh]=(A−wj)μjQjh−Qjh2(μj2+σj2)−γQihQjhμiμj+sj(1−μj)Qjh.Define m = (wj− Cj)μj− sj(1 − μj) as the supplier j’s expected profit margin for each unit ordered by the retailer, i.e., with probability μjthe supplier receives ωjfor each unit of successful delivery with cost Cj, and with probability 1 − μjthe supplier pays sjfor each unit of shortage. The expected profit of supplier j becomes:(11)E(πj,sh)=mQjh.The setup of the Hybrid Competition Game is as follows.Definition 1Hybrid Competition GameA Hybrid Competition Game is defined as•Players: a set of three players: central planner i, retailer j, and supplier j,There are two stages in the game•Stage 1: supplier j announces the contract term m to retailer j.Stage 2: central planner i and retailer j choose production quantitiesQihandQjhsimultaneously.Payoff: the expected profits for the three players areE(πi,rh(Qih,Qjh)),E(πj,rh(Qih,Qjh,m)),andE(πj,sh(Qjh,m)),respectively.The goal of the central planner i is to maximize the expected total profit of chain i, whereas retailer j and supplier j want to maximize their individual expected profits. The Hybrid Competition is a dynamic game. For such game, Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) is the most commonly used equilibrium concept (Osborne, 2004). A strategy profile is a SPNE if the players’ strategies constitute a Nash Equilibrium in every subgame.Definition 2A pure strategy SPNE(Qih(m),Qjh(m),m*)of the Hybrid Competition Game satisfies1.Retailers compete with each other in quantities to maximize their profits for any given contract m (not necessary optimal), i.e.,Qih*(m)∈argmaxQih≥0E(πih(Qih,Qjh(m))),Qjh*(m)∈argmaxQjh≥0E(πj,rh(Qih(m),Qjh,m)).Supplier j sets the contract term m to maximize its expected profit given the choices of retailers, i.e.,m*∈argmaxm≥0E(πj,sh(Qjh(m),m)).The following lemma characterizes the equilibrium strategies for both retailers as a function of contract term m.Lemma 1At a pure strategy SPNE of the Hybrid Competition Game,1.ifμjKj−2(1+δj2)μjKiγ<m<μjKj−γμjKi2(1+δi2),(12)Qih(m)=2(1+δj2)μjKi−(Kjμj−m)γμiμj(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2),(13)Qjh(m)=2(1+δi2)(μjKj−m)−γμjKiμj2(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2).ifm≤μjKj−2(1+δj2)μjKiγ,(14)Qih(m)=0,(15)Qjh(m)=μjKj−m2μj2(1+δj2).ifμjKj−γμjKi2(1+δi2)≤m≤μjKj,(16)Qih(m)=Ki2μi(1+δi2),(17)Qjh(m)=0.The following theorem characterizes the equilibrium contract terms m* and order quantities.Theorem 2At an SPNE of the Hybrid Competition Game, supplier j’s contract term m*, supply chain i’s order quantityQih*,and retailer j’s order quantityQjh*satisfy(i)ifλ≥2(1+δi2)γ,m*can be any value in [0, Kjμj],Qih*=Ki2μi(1+δi2),Qjh*=0.if2γ(1+δi2)8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2<λ<2(1+δi2)γ,m*=μj(Kj2−γKi4(1+δi2)),Qih*=Ki(8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)−2γKj(1+δi2)4μi(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)(1+δi2),Qjh*=2Kj(1+δi2)−γKi2μj(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2).ifγ4(1+δj2)<λ≤2γ(1+δi2)8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2,m*=Kjμj−2(1+δj2)μjKiγ,Qih*=0,Qjh*=Kiγμj.ifλ≤γ4(1+δj2),m*=Kjμj2,Qih*=0,Qjh*=Kj4(1+δj2)μj.Note that as we assume Ki> 0 and Kj> 0 we exclude the case whereQih*=Qjh*=0.Similar to the Centralized Competition Game, we obtain the following comparative statics.Corollary 4When both chains sell to the market and the cost structures are symmetric (i.e., Ci= Cj), the equilibrium order quantity and expected profit for supply chain i increase in δjand decrease in δi. That is, one supply chain’s order quantity and expected profit increase as its competing supply chain’s uncertainty increases and decrease as its own supply uncertainty increases.Figs. 4and 5 present some numerical examples of Corollary 4. For illustration purposes, we let Ci= Cj= C, γ = 1 and normalize (A − C) to 1. The horizontal axis in both figures represents the uncertainty level of supply chain j, δj. In Fig. 4 the vertical axis is the expected order quantity of supply chain i, whereas in Fig. 5 the vertical axis is the expected order quantity of supply chain j. The four curves represent different uncertainty levels of supply chain i, with δi= 0, 0.5, 1, 2, each representing the case with no, small, medium, and high levels of supply uncertainty, respectively.Corollary 5When both chains sell to the market and have the same cost (i.e., Ci= Cj), the equilibrium order quantity and expected profit for supply chain i decrease in γ.Figs. 6and 7 provide some numerical examples to illustrate Corollary 5. As the chain competition intensity (γ) increases, the expected supplies of both chains (μiQih*andμjQjh*) and their expected profits (E(πih*)andE(πjh*)) both decrease. The next corollary shows the impact of supply uncertainty and competitive intensity on the expected total market supply and price.Corollary 6At the SPNE of the Hybrid Competition Game, when the two supply chains have the same costs (i.e., Ci= Cj), the expected market supply decreases in δi, δjand γ; whereas, the expected market price increases in δiand δj, but decreases in γ.Next we compare the equilibrium order quantities under the Hybrid Competition Game with those in the Centralized Competition Game. We obtain the following result:Corollary 7In the Hybrid Competition Game, the equilibrium order quantity for chain i is greater than that in the Centralized Competition Game, i.e.,Qih*>Qi*; while the order quantity of chain j’s is smaller, i.e.,Qjh*<Qj*.Corollary 7 says that for the same uncertainty level and competition level, the order quantity for the centralized supply chain i increases while that for the decentralized supply chain j decreases, when comparing the Hybrid Competition Game with the Centralized Competition Game. Fig. 8provides a numerical example. Here we let Ci= Cj= C, δi= δj= δ, γ = 1 and normalize (A − C) to 1. The horizontal axis is the uncertainty level of supply chains δ, varying from 0 to 3, and the vertical axis is the expected order quantity of each supply chain. The middle solid curve represents the order quantity of chains i and j in the Centralized Competition Game, whereas the top and bottom dashed curves represent the order quantity of chain i (centralized) and chain j (decentralized) in the Hybrid Competition Game, respectively.We have similar results for the expected profits of supply chains. Further discussions are provided in Section 5.Now we study the case where both supply chains are decentralized and adopt wholesale price contracts with linear penalty. Each supplier i ∈ {1, 2} charges its retailer a wholesale price ωiper unit of successful delivery and pays the retailer a penalty siper unit of unfilled order. We use superscript “u” to indicate that both chains are decentralized. Define mi= μi(ωi− Ci) − (1 − μi)si.Definition 3Decentralized Competition GameA Decentralized Competition Game is defined as•Players: a set of four players: retailer i, retailer j, supplier i, and supplier j.There are two stages in the game•Stage 1: two suppliers announce the contract term miand mjsimultaneously.Stage 2: two retailers choose production quantityQiuandQjusimultaneously.Payoff: the expected revenues for the four players areE(πi,ru(Qiu,Qju,mi)),E(πj,ru(Qiu,Qju,mj)),E(πi,su(Qiu,mi)),andE(πj,su(Qju,mj)),respectively. The payoff functions are defined similarly as in Eqs. (10) and (11).A pure strategy SPNE(Qiu(mi,mj),Qju(mi,mj),mi*,mj*)of the game between two decentralized supply chains satisfies:1.Retailers compete with each other in quantities to maximize their profits for any given contracts (mi, mj) (not necessary optimal), i.e.,Qiu(mi,mj)∈argmaxQiu≥0E(πi,r(Qiu,Qju(mi,mj),mi)),Suppliers compete with each other in contract terms to maximize their profits given the choices of retailers, i.e.,mi*∈argmaxmi≥0miQiu(mi,mj*).The following results characterize the equilibrium strategies of the retailers and the suppliers. For expositional simplicity, we let Bi= μiKi− miand Bj= μjKj− mj.Lemma 2At a pure strategy SPNE of the Hybrid Competition Game,1.ifγμjBi2μi(1+δi2)<Bj<2μjBi(1+δj2)γμi,(18)Qiu=2μj(1+δj2)Bi−γμiBjμi2μj(4δi2δj2+4δi2+4δj2+4−γ2)(19)Qju=2μi(1+δi2)Bj−γμjBiμiμj2(4δi2δj2+4δi2+4δj2+4−γ2)ifBj≥2μjBi(1+δj2)γμi,(20)Qiu=0(21)Qju=Bj2μj2(1+δj2)ifBj≤γμjBi2μi(1+δi2),(22)Qiu=Bi2μi2(1+δi2)(23)Qju=0At the SPNE of the Decentralized Competition Game, supplier i (i = 1, 2) chooses the contract termsmi*(equivalentlyBi*) and order quantityQiu*as follows:(i)if2γ(1+δi2)8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2<λ<8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ22γ(1+δj2)Bi*=2μi(1+δi2)(4Ki(1+δj2)+γKj)16(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2,Bj*=2μj(1+δj2)(4Kj(1+δi2)+γKi)16(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2,Qiu*=2(1+δj2)((8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)Ki−2γKj(1+δi2))μi(16(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2),Qju*=2(1+δi2)((8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)Kj−2γKi(1+δj2))μj(16(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2).ifλ<γ4(1+δj2),Bi*can be any value in (0, Kiμi],Bj*=Kjμj2,Qiu*=0,Qju*=Kj4μj(1+δj2).ifγ4(1+δj2)≤λ≤2γ(1+δi2)8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2,Bi*=Kiμi,Bj*=2Kiμj(1+δj2)γ,Qiu*=0,Qju*=Kiγμj.if8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ22γ(1+δj2)≤λ≤4(1+δi2)γ,Bi*=2Kjμi(1+δi2)γ,Bj*=Kjμj,Qiu*=Kjγμi,Qju*=0.ifλ>4(1+δi2)γ,Bj*can be any value in (0, Kjμj] ,Bi*=Kiμi2,Qiu*=Ki4μi(1+δi2),Qju*=0.Note that as we assume Ki> 0 and Kj> 0 we exclude the case whereQiu*=Qju*=0.Similar to the Centralized Competition and Hybrid Competition Games, we obtain the following comparative statics.Corollary 8At the SPNE of the Decentralized Competition Game when both retailers sell to the market and cost structures are symmetric (i.e., Ci= Cj), the equilibrium order quantity and expected profit for supply chain i increase with δjand decrease with δi.At the SPNE of the Decentralized Competition Game with symmetric cost structures and supply uncertainties (i.e., Ci= Cjand δi= δj), if both retailers sell to the market, the equilibrium order quantity and expected profit for supply chain i decrease with the competitive intensity γ.The above two corollaries present the impact of supply uncertainty and supply chain competition on the equilibrium decisions and performances. On the one hand, one supply chain’s order quantity and expected profit increase as its competing supply chain’s uncertainty increases, while decrease as its own supply uncertainty increases. On the other hand, one supply chain’s order quantity and expected profit decrease as the competition from the other supply chain intensifies.Corollary 10At the SPNE of the Decentralized Competition Game when both retailers sell to the market and cost structures are symmetric (i.e., Ci= Cj), the expected market supply decreases in δiand δj. As a result, the expected market price increases in δiand δj.At the SPNE of the Decentralized Competition Game with the symmetric cost structures and supply uncertainties (i.e., Ci= Cjand δi= δj), if both retailers sell to the market and cost structures, the expected market supply and market price both decrease in γ.In the previous section, we derive the optimal ordering decision and contract design for the Centralized, Hybrid and Decentralized Competition Games. In this section we consider the strategic-level question: Does supply chain centralization provide a competitive advantage when dealing with competition and supply uncertainty?To answer this question, we first calculate the expected payoffs in the Centralized, Hybrid and Decentralized Competition Games, based on the equilibrium order quantities we have derived in the previous section (assuming that both chains sell to the market).Under the Centralized Competition Game:(24)E(πi*)=(1+δi2)(2(1+δj2)Ki−γKj)2(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2(25)E(πj*)=(1+δj2)(2(1+δi2)Kj−γKi)2(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2Under the Decentralized Competition Game:(26)E(πiu)=2(1+δj2)(6(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)(2γ(1+δi2)Kj−(8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)Ki)2(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2(16(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2,(27)E(πju)=2(1+δi2)(6(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)(2γ(1+δj2)Ki−(8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)Kj)2(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2(16(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2.Under the Hybrid Competition Game where chain i is centralized and chain j is decentralized:(28)E(πih)=(2γKj(1+δi2)−Ki(8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2))216(1+δi2)(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2,(29)E(πjh)=(2Kj(1+δi2)−γKi)2(6(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)8(1+δi2)(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2.Under the Hybrid Competition Game where chain j is centralized and chain i is decentralized:(30)E(πih′)=(2Ki(1+δj2)−γKj)2(6(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)8(1+δj2)(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2,(31)E(πjh′)=(2γKi(1+δj2)−Kj(8(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2))216(1+δj2)(4(1+δi2)(1+δj2)−γ2)2.Here “h” denotes the case when chain i is centralized and chain j is not, whereas “h′” denotes the case when chain j is centralized and chain i is not.Table 1summarizes these results. We compare these expected profits under different competition games and obtain the following theorem.Theorem 4When both chains sell to the market, we findE(πih)>E(πiu),E(πi*)>E(πih′),E(πjh′)>E(πju),andE(πj*)>E(πjh). Hence, given the competing supply chain’s fixed strategic decision (to centralize or not), a supply chain is always better off by choosing to centralize. That is, centralization is the dominant strategy for both supply chains. However, centralization may or may not result in positive gains for each supply chain, as the payoff difference between the centralized and decentralized games,E(πi*)−E(πiu),can be either negative or positive.The proof is provided in the Appendix A. If we consider the choice of centralization as a strategic-level game, Theorem 4 implies that centralization would be a unique Nash Equilibrium. However, centralization may lead to lower profit, which means that a prisoners’ dilemma may occur.To further understand the implications of Theorem 4, let us consider the special case of two supply chains with same costs and supply risks, i.e., δi= δj= δ and Ci= Cj= C. Let K = A − C. It can be verified that the expected profits for supply chains i and j under the Centralized Competition Game becomeE(πi*)=E(πj*)=(1+δ2)K2(γ+2δ2+2)2≜R.To simplify exposition, we let “R” representE(πi*)andE(πj*). The expected supply chain profits under the Decentralized Competition Game becomeE(πiu)=E(πju)=2K2(1+δ2)(6(1+δ2)2−γ2)(γ+2δ2+2)2(4δ2+4−γ)2=2(6(1+δ2)2−γ2)(4δ2+4−γ)2R.The expected supply chain profits under the Hybrid Competition Game are as follows,E(πih)=E(πjh′)=K2(γ+4δ2+4)216(1+δ2)(γ+2δ2+2)2=(γ+4δ2+4)216(1+δ2)2R,E(πjh)=E(πih′)=K2(6(1+δ2)2−γ2)8(1+δ2)(γ+2δ2+2)2=(6(1+δ2)2−γ2)8(1+δ2)2R.These results are summarized in Table 2. It is easy to verify that6(1+δ2)2−γ28(1+δ2)2<1and(γ+4δ2+4)216(1+δ2)2>2(6(1+δ2)2−γ2)(4δ2+4−γ)2. This means that centralization is better off for each chain, no matter whether the other chain is centralized or not—in other words, centralization is the dominant strategy for both supply chains. However, as shown in Fig. 9, we can also see that whenγ>2(1+δ2)3,we have2(6(δ2+1)2−γ2)(4δ2+4−γ)2>1,which means that a chain receives less profit in the centralized game than in the decentralized game. This leads to a “prisoner’s dilemma”, i.e., both supply chains are worse off under the centralized scenario although centralization is the dominant strategy. On the other hand, whenγ<2(1+δ2)3,the profit for each chain in the Centralized Competition Game is higher than that in the Decentralized Competition Game.Note that Boyaci and Gallego (2004) first discovered the phenomenon of the prisoner’s dilemma in supply chain competition, assuming that there is no supply uncertainty. Here we show that their finding is still true when supply risk is low and supply chain competition intensity is relatively high, but it no longer holds if supply chain competition intensity is low and/or the supply risk becomes more substantial.Fig. 10presents some numerical examples, where the x-axis is level of supply uncertainty δ, the y-axis is expected supply chain profit. We let γ = 1 and normalize A − C to 1. There are four curves: the black solid curve represents the expected profit of chain i (i = 1, 2) in Centralized Competition Game; the blue dashed curve represents the expected profit of chain i (i = 1, 2) in Decentralized Competition Game (Note that because the two chains are completely symmetric in both games, chain 1’s profits are the same as those of chain 2); the purple dashed curve represents the expected profit of chain i, while the red dashed curve represents the expected profit of chain j in the Hybrid Competition Game, where we assume that chain i is centralized and chain j is decentralized.We can see that a decentralized supply chain is better off by moving toward centralization if the other supply chain is centralized, since the black solid curve is always above the red dashed curve. Furthermore, a decentralized supply chain is better off by moving toward centralization if the other supply chain is decentralized, since the purple dashed curve is always above the blue dashed curve. Hence, centralization is the dominant strategy for both supply chains.When supply risk is high (δ≥1/2), centralization leads to higher profits, since the blue dashed curve is above the black solid curve; however, when supply risk is low, it is the opposite. This means that the desirability of centralization is increased by the presence of supply risk. This finding is consistent with some real-life observations, e.g., as we discussed in Section 1, the two largest dairy companies in China, Yili and Mengniu, are both increasingly vertically integrated, due to the high risk of quality milk supply.Now a related question is: do individual retailer and supplier in a decentralized chain have the right incentives to integrate?We may consider a revenue sharing contract where the supplier’s income consists of three parts: ω for each unit ordered by the retailer, a percentage of retail revenue for each successfully delivered order, and a penalty for each unit that the supplier fails to deliver. Let ϕ ∈ [0, 1] be the fraction of supply chain revenue the retailer keeps, so the supplier earns the remaining (1 − ϕ).11Here we choose revenue sharing contract as an example of supply chain coordination tool, as it is a commonly-used coordinating contract in supply chain literature and practice (Cachon and Lariviere, 2005). We do acknowledge that there are many other types of supply chain contracts, such as buy-back contracts (Pasternack, 1985), quantity-flexibility contracts (Tsay, 1999), sales-rebate contracts (Taylor, 2002), etc. We leave the comprehensive examination of all types of supply chain contracts that can coordinate under supply uncertainty to future research.The profit functions for the retailer, the supplier, and the central planner areE(πr)=E[(ϕp−ω)Qα+SQ(1−α)],E(πs)=E{[(1−ϕ)p+ω]Qα−SQ(1−α)−CQα]},E(π)=E(πr)+E(πs)=E(pQα).Here α is a random variable that represents yield uncertainty. Assume that α is generally distributed in (0,1] with average value of μ. When ωμ − (1 − μ)S − Cμ = 0, we haveE(πr)=E[ϕpQα]=ϕE(π),i.e., the profit of the retailer is an affine function of the central planner. Hence, such a revenue sharing contract coordinates the supply chain. Based on this finding, we can show that the following is true.Lemma 3For any given linear price and penalty contract, there always exists a coordinating revenue-sharing contract that makes both the supplier and retailer better off.To prove Lemma 3, we examine the centralization decision for a supply chain (say chain j) in two cases: (i) when the other supply chain is centralized; and (ii) when the other supply chain is decentralized.Case (i) when the other supply chain (chain i) is centralized: We compare the expected profits for retailer j and supplier j in centralized and decentralized scenarios, to see whether they are better off under centralization or not. As Theorem 4 suggests,E(πjh)<E(πj*),meaning that the entire supply chain j would be better off if it centralizes. Suppose that under a given linear contract, retailer j earns a profit ofE(πj,rh)and supplier j earns a profit ofE(πj,sh). Consider when supplier j and retailer j engage in a revenue-sharing contract with profit split ratioϕj=E(πj,rh)/E(πjh). It is clear that retailer j is better off sinceϕjE(πj*)>ϕjE(πjh)=E(πj,rh)E(πjh)E(πjh)=E(πj,rh),and so is supplier j since(1−ϕj)E(πj*)>(1−ϕj)E(πjh)=E(πj,sh).Case (ii) when the other supply chain (chain i) is decentralized: Without loss of generality, we assume that supply chain j uses a linear contract and supply chain i can choose either to coordinate or stick with a given linear contract. As Theorem 4 suggests,E(πiu)<E(πih). We defineϕi=E(πi,ru)/E(πiu)and let ϕibe the profit split ratio of a revenue-sharing contract, we see that both the retailer and supplier are better off under this contract.Hence, we can conclude that there exists a coordinating contract that achieves Pareto improvement in a supply chain regardless whether the other supply chain is centralized or not.Note that in the above discussion, we just provide an example of how profit may be split between the retailer and the supplier. Several existing papers have provided analysis and discussion about how to derive the optimal revenue share ϕ in supply chain coordination (e.g., Wang, Jiang, and Shen, 2004; Dana and Spier, 2001; Cachon and Lariviere, 2005, etc.). The same logic can be applied here. Hence, we omit the detailed discussions here.Next, we examine customer service in terms of expected total market supply and price under the Centralized, Hybrid, and Decentralized Competition Games. A better customer service means higher total expected market supply and lower expected market price.Theorem 5When both chains sell to the market, the Centralized Competition Game provides the best service to customers in terms of total expected market supply, the Hybrid Competition Game provides the second, and the Decentralized Competition Game provides the worst service, i.e., T* > Th > Tu.Theorem 5 says that customers always benefit from supply chain centralization with more supplies and a lower price. Figs. 11–14 provide numerical examples, where we assume that the two supply chains have the same costs and the same levels of supply uncertainty. We let γ = 0.5 in Figs. 11and 13 and δ = 0 in Figs. 12and 14. Figs. 11 and 12 compare the total market supplies in different competition games, and show that centralized competition game always leads to the largest expected total market supplies. Figs. 13 and 14 compare the retail prices in different competition games and show that centralization always leads to lower retail prices. Therefore, in terms of expected market supply and price, customers are always better off when both supply chains are centralized.
