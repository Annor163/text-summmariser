@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A main requirement for achieving high efficiency in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is that all charges and electrically generated excitons should be employed for emission. We fabricated blue phosphorescent OLEDs with four types electron transporting layers, which were doped with lithium quinolate (Liq) from 0% to 10%. A series of blue devices consisted of indium tin oxide (ITO, 180nm)/4,4-bis[N-(naphthyl)-N-phenyl-amino]biphenyl (NPB, 50nm)/N,N′-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP, 10nm)/iridium(III)bis[(4,6-di-fluoropheny)-pyridinato-N,C2] picolinate (FIrpic) doped in mCP (8%, 30nm)/1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazole-2-yl)benzene (TPBi, 20nm)/TPBi mixed with Liq (20nm)/Liq (2nm)/aluminum (Al, 100nm). The blue OLED doped with 5% Liq, which demonstrated a maximum luminous efficiency and external quantum efficiency of 17.64cd/A and 8.78%, respectively, were found to be superior to the other blue devices.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recently, the development of high efficient blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has attracted considerable interest due to their practical applications in flat panel display and solid-state lighting [1–3]. Researchers have studied phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) in order to realize a high efficiency using charge trapping and exciton confinement by a high triplet exciton blocking layer inserted between the emitting layer (EML) and hole transport layer (HTL). Also, systematic studies on carrier injection and transport are very important for achieving high efficiency in OLEDs [4–7]. Thus, all charges and electrically generated excitons have to be used to maximize their performance in EML. Due to this fact, it is necessary to improve the carrier transport using interface modification. Hung et al. reported a bilayer structure of Al/LiF as an interface to enhance the electron injection and the electroluminescence (EL) efficiency. The use of Li metal as an interface between aluminum and the organic layer is also reported to lower the driving voltage [8–10].In this study, we demonstrated efficient triplet exciton confinement in high efficient blue PHOLEDs using combination with various electron transport layers (ETLs), which were doped with lithium quinolate (Liq). Doped ETLs have good electron injection and electron transport properties. Both N,N′-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP) and 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazole-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) as electron blocking layer (EBL) were able to confine exciton efficiently.The ITO on glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 10Ω/sq was used as a transparent anode. The ITO glass was chemically cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using the following sequence: acetone, methanol, de-ionized water, and isopropyl alcohol. Afterwards, pre-cleaned ITO glass was treated by oxygen plasma with the power of 125W for 2min under a low vacuum of 2×10−2Torr. Organic layers, Liq, and cathode were deposited with thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.3–0.5Å/s, 0.1Å/s, and 10Å/s, respectively. The evaporation rates were controlled using a quartz crystal monitor. The size of the emitting region in the pixel was 3mm×3mm. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OLEDs were measured using a source-measure unit (Keithley 236) with a DC voltage. The optical and electrical properties of the devices, such as the luminance (L), EL efficiencies, Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates, and EL spectra characteristics, were analyzed using CHROMA METER CS-1000 instruments. All measurements were carried out under ambient conditions at room temperature.
