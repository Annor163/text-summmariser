@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Gene selection and sample classification based on gene expression data are important research trends in bioinformatics. It is very difficult to select significant genes closely related to classification because of the high dimension and small sample size of gene expression data. Rough set based on neighborhood has been successfully applied to gene selection, as it selects attributes without redundancy and deals with numerical attributes directly. Construction of neighborhoods, approximation operators and attribute reduction algorithm are three key components in this gene selection approach. In this study, a novel neighborhood named intersection neighborhood for numerical data was defined. The performances of two kinds of approximation operators were compared on gene expression data. A significant gene selection algorithm, which was applied to the analysis of plant stress response, was proposed by using positive region and gene ranking, and then this algorithm with thresholds optimization for intersection neighborhood was extended. The performance of the proposed algorithm, along with a comparison with other related methods, classical algorithms and rough set methods, was analyzed. The results of experiments on four data sets showed that intersection neighborhood was more flexible to adapt to the data with various structure, and approximation operator based on elementary set was more suitable for this application than that based on element. That was to say that the proposed algorithms were effective, as they could select significant gene subsets without redundancy and achieve high classification accuracy.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the development of microarray technology and genetic sequencing technology, more and more gene expression data sets containing large amounts of information are obtained, which allowed simultaneous monitoring of the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes. A increasing number of bioinformatics researchers had paid more attention to mine gene expression data. One of the important trends in bioinformatics was the identification of genes or groups of genes to differentiate diseased tissues from normal tissues, which could be viewed as gene selection and sample classification [1]. This study was of great significance on plant stress response [2–5], tumor and cancer classification [6–9], disease diagnosis [10–12], etc.Plants encountered numerous stresses in the field, including biotic and abiotic stresses. Biotic stresses were derived from the infection of virus and pathogens, and the invasion of herbivorous insects and parasitic plants. Others were abiotic stresses which were derived from global climate change and environmental disruption caused by industrial manufacture, such as salt, drought stress, heavy metals, high intensity light, etc. From the viewpoint of agriculture and nature conservation, it was important to diagnose the kind of plant stresses before the appearance of some symptoms, such as inhibition of growth, leaf injury and plant death [2].It is a challenging problem to select significant genes which are closely related to classification because of the high dimension and small sample size of gene expression data. Gene selection methods can be generally divided into two categories: filter methods in which gene selection is independent of classification, and wrapper methods which combine gene selection with a classifier. Most filter methods employ gene ranking approaches in which genes are ranked according to some criterions, such as statistical test [3,6,13]. While wrapper methods update the selected gene subset iteratively, according to a criterion such as accuracy of the classifier [4,14–17]. However, these methods have some weakness. For instance, filter methods select genes only using individual contribution, while ignoring mutual information among genes. Wrapper methods are unstable to some extent, because the accuracy is sensitive to the selected gene subset [10]. Meanwhile, many redundant genes may be selected by these methods, since there are only several significant genes closely related to classification.Rough set theory, proposed by Pawlak in 1982 [18], has been successfully applied to gene selection, as it can get rid of redundant attributes using individual attribute information and mutual information among them. Rough set theory is a useful tool to deal with vague, uncertain and incomplete information. A number of the researches on its theories and applications were reported [18–24]. The selection criterions were constructed, which used attribute dependence and significance measure based on classical rough set model, and employed those criterions in gene selection [25–27]. However, classical rough set model could only deal with data with nominal attributes, so the data needed to be discretized before gene selection, which led to information dropout. To address this problem, many extended rough set models were employed. Variable precision rough set (VPRS) were introduced, which allowed identifying data patterns that otherwise would be lost, to the selection and classification of gene expression data [28]. They selected the most relevant supergenes by two methods, the criterion of maximum β-relevance and the VPRS-Q algorithm, both supported by VPRS. Dai and Xu [7] proposed an attribute selection method for gene expression data based on fuzzy gain ratio under the framework of fuzzy rough set theory which combined fuzzy set theory and rough set theory. In addition, Wang et al. [8,9,29] proposed a series of gene selection and classification methods using neighborhood rough set model defined by Hu et al. [30–32]. They employed δ neighborhood to deal with numerical data directly, and used forward attribute reduction algorithm to select genes.Three key components in gene selection methods using rough set model based on neighborhood are construction of neighborhoods, approximation operators and attribute reduction algorithm. How to construct neighborhoods to suit for various data structures, and design more effective attribute reduction algorithm, are problems to be solved. Study on those components is meaningful for the development of gene selection based on expression data. In this study, we defined a novel neighborhood for numerical data, named intersection neighborhood, which could be more flexible to adapt to data with various structure. The performances of two kinds of approximation operators on expression data were compared. We proposed a significant gene selection algorithm using positive region and gene ranking, and then extended this algorithm with thresholds optimization for intersection neighborhood. The proposed algorithms were applied to the analysis of plant stress response.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some basic concepts about rough set and neighborhood are introduced, and intersection neighborhood is defined. The framework of gene selection using rough set model based on neighborhood is elaborated and a novel significant gene selection algorithm is proposed in Section 3. In Section 4, an extended algorithm with thresholds optimization for intersection neighborhood is proposed. Compared with other related methods, classical algorithms and rough set algorithms, experimental results are shown in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper.The main idea of rough set theory is building elementary sets of knowledge representation on object space, and then using two sets, which can be represented based on elementary sets, to approximate an indescribable set. Rough set model based on neighborhood is an extended model of Pawlak classical rough set model, in which neighborhoods are elementary sets [19,33]. In this section, we discuss two key definitions in this extended model in detail, neighborhood and approximation, and then propose a new definition of neighborhood.A neighborhood of an object x is a set of objects with similar characteristics to x. A generalized definition for neighborhood has been given according to binary relation [19].Definition 2.1[19]For an object x∈U, U is a nonempty finite set of objects called the universe, and a binary relation R on U, the neighborhood of x is:(1)NR(x)={y|xRy,y∈U}.On the basis of the generalized definition, many specific definition formulas of neighborhood are proposed to deal with complex real data. As all data in gene selection are numerical attributes, we focus on the definitions of neighborhood for numerical attributes, which are usually induced by metric functions. The δ neighborhood defined by Hu et al. is an effective way to deal with numerical attributes.Definition 2.2[31]For an object x∈U and a subset of attributes B⊆C, the δ neighborhood of x induced by B is defined as:(2)δB(x)={y|ΔB(x,y)≤δ,y∈U},where ΔB(x,y) is a distance metric function to determine the shape of neighborhood and δ is a threshold to control the size of neighborhood. For numerical attributes, a general used metric, named Minkowsky distance, is defined as:(3)ΔB(x,y)=∑b∈Bfb(x)−fb(y)p1/p,where (1) it is called Manhattan distance, if p=1; (2) Euclidean distance, if p=2; (3) Chebychev distance, if p=∞.The δ neighborhood can be represented with the form of neighborhood defined in Definition 2.1 by constructing a binary relation based on the metric function. The binary relation is:(4)ΔBδ={(x,y)∈U×U|ΔB(x,y)≤δ}.It is shown that this binary relation is a tolerance relation as it is reflexive and symmetric but not transitive.In the gene selection based on gene expression data, Euclidean distance is the most frequently used. The δ neighborhood mentioned in the rest of this study is all based on Euclidean distance unless otherwise specified. However, there are some limitations of δ neighborhood. On one hand, the shape of δ neighborhood is a circular for two attributes, sphere for three attributes and hypersphere for more attributes, so this neighborhood is not suited to deal with data in which the structure is square, cube or hypercube. On the other hand, the threshold δ is not changed with different attributes or different number of attributes, because it is hardly realistic to determine different value of δ for so many possible cases. In order to deal with the problems above, a new definition of neighborhood named intersection neighborhood is proposed.Definition 2.3For an object x∈U and a subset of attributes B⊆C, the intersection neighborhood of x induced by B is defined as:(5)NBδ(x)={y|∀b∈B,|fb(x)−fb(y)|≤δb,y∈U},where δbis a specific threshold for the attribute b.In the view of relation, the intersection neighborhood can be viewed as a neighborhood based on a tolerance relation shown as follows:(6)RBδ={(x,y)∈U×U|∀b∈B,|fb(x)−fb(y)|≤δb}.Then, the intersection neighborhood can also be represented with the form of neighborhood defined in Definition 2.1. And this tolerance relation satisfies a property thatRBδ=⋂b∈BR{b}δ, while the tolerance relation, which δ neighborhood based on, does not satisfy the property with the similar form,ΔBδ≠⋂b∈BΔ{b}δ. This property implies that intersection neighborhoods can ensure that the characteristics of attributes are not influenced by each other in a larger extent than δ neighborhood.The shapes of δ neighborhood and intersection neighborhood on two attributes are shown in Fig. 1. The circular corresponds to δ neighborhood and the rectangle to intersection neighborhood. δ neighborhood is suitable for data with spheroidal structure and intersection neighborhood is suitable for data with cuboid structure. Only from gene expression data, it is difficult to know the relationships between genes, although they really exist among some genes. It is necessary to assume that the genes are independent with each other for gene selection only based on gene expression data. In this case, intersection neighborhood with cuboid structure is more suitable, as it can ensure the independence of genes in a larger extent. Meanwhile, intersection neighborhood can be more flexible to adapt to the data with various structure than δ neighborhood, because there is a specific threshold for each attribute in intersection neighborhood.The lower and upper approximation operators are two important concepts in rough set theory. There are two main formal definitions of approximation. One is based on the element (point) of U, and the other on the elementary set (point set).Approximation operators in rough set model based on neighborhood were discussed [34]. Two definitions, which are based on the element and elementary set respectively, are shown in follows.Definition 2.4[34]For a subset of objects X⊆U and a binary relation R on U,(1)the lower and upper approximations of X based on element are:definitions of approximations based on elementary set are:The lower approximation set contains all points which can be certainly classified as points of X based on R. The upper approximation set is the set of points which can be possibly classified as points of X.The relationship of the two formal definitions of approximation operator and obtained the following property had been discussed [34].Property 2.1[34]If the binary relation R is reflexive,(11)apr_R(X)⊆apr_R′(X)⊆X⊆apr¯R′(X)⊆apr¯R(X).This property shows that approximations in Definition 2.4(2) were tighter approximations and more closer to the object set X than those in Definition 2.4(1). However, the definition of approximations based on elementary set is few used in gene selection. In this paper, we use the two formal definitions of approximation and compare the performances of the two kinds of approximation operators experimentally.In this section, the framework of gene selection is elaborated by using rough set model based on neighborhood and a novel significant gene selection algorithm is proposed.The process of gene selection based on rough set theory mainly consists of two parts: gene pre-selection and significant gene selection using attribute reduction. The aim of gene pre-selection is to reduce the scale of gene set to several hundred quickly. While significant gene selection acquires a small subset of genes without redundancy based on rough set model. The framework of gene selection in this paper is shown in Fig. 2.In Fig. 2, each step of the process is described as follows:Step 1. Apply Wilcoxcon rank sum test (WRST) [35] to compute a p-value for each gene and rank all genes according to their p-value in ascending order. A gene with smaller p-value means that this gene is more effective for classification. Then, select n top-ranked genes as candidate gene subset.Step 2. Apply an attribute reduction algorithm in rough set based on neighborhood to reduce genes in candidate gene subset. The neighborhood is chosen from δ neighborhood and intersection neighborhood. The threshold of neighborhood is changed from 0.01 to 1 with step 0.01. For intersection neighborhood, we set the same threshold for each gene. A reduced gene subset is obtained corresponding to each threshold.Step 3. Classify samples with support vector machine (SVM) according to each gene subset obtained in Step 2 and achieve a classification accuracy corresponding to each gene subset.Step 4. Sort gene subsets according to classification accuracy and select 10 gene subset with higher classification accuracy and fewer genes.WRST is a non-parametric hypothesis test method for two-class samples, which does not care about the samples distribution. Rank sum test has been employed as a gene ranking method for gene pre-selection as it is not affected by the scale of gene set [36]. The analysis of plant stress response mostly is a two-class samples classification, so we choose WRST in pre-selection.For each gene, the samples in two classes, labeled as Class1 and Class2, are denoted by X={xi|i=1,2,…,n1} and Y={yj|j=1,2,…,n2}, respectively. xi(or yj) is the expression quantity of this gene corresponding to the sample and viewed as observations in statistical test; n1 and n2 are the number of samples in Class1 and Class2, respectively. Rank all (n1+n2) samples together based on the observations in ascending order. The sample with the smallest observation obtains rank 1; the biggest one obtains rank (n1+n2); the samples with the same observation obtain the average of their ranks. The sum of ranks with the same class label is called the rank sum of this class. Then, calculate a value for each gene based on the test statistic of WRST defined as follows.Definition 3.1[35]For n1,n2>10, the test statistic of Wilcoxon rank sum test is:(12)Z=U−n1n2/2n1n2n1+n2+1/12∼N(0,1)U is the smaller of U1=n1n2+[n1(n1+1)]−T1 and U2=n1n2+[n2(n2+1)]−T2, where T1 and T2 are the rank sum of Class1 and Class2, respectively. Z∼N(0,1) means that the distribution of test statistic Z is standard normal distribution which is a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.p-value is calculated for each gene to determine whether there is a significant difference between samples in the two classes. The smaller the p-value is, the more significant the difference is.Definition 3.2For a gene g, the p-value of g is:(13)p=P(|Z|>|Zg|),where Zgis the specific Z value for gene g calculated by Eq. (12) and P(A) is the probability of A.Finally, rank all genes based on p-value in ascending order and select n top-ranked genes as the result of gene pre-selection.Rough set theory is applied to gene selection. The gene expression data is represented as a decision table. Let GEDT=(S,G∪D,V,f) be a gene expression data table, where S={s1,s2,…,sm} is the set of samples, G={g1,g2,…,gn} is the set of genes selected in pre-selection and D={d} is the class label. For a gene g∈G and a sample s, the value of fg(s) is the expression quantity of gene g in sample s and fD(s) is the class label of sample s.A gene set Go⊆G is a reduction of G, if and only if the following two conditions are met:(1)POSGo(D)=POSG(D);for each gene g∈Go,POSGo−{g}(D)≠POSG(D);It is a NP-hard problem to find all reductions or the smallest reduction of an attribute set because of the combinatorial explosion of attributes. Heuristic information is necessary for seeking a satisfactory reduction, such as the significance of attributes [31], and information entropy [22,37]. As each gene is associated with a rank value in gene pre-selection, we choose a simple reduction algorithm based on positive region and employ the rank of genes as heuristic information in this study. We call this algorithm as significant gene selection algorithm based on positive region and gene ranking (SGS_PRGR). The process of this algorithm is described as follows.Algorithm 3.1SGS_PRGRIt should be noted that the neighborhoods in this algorithm can be δ neighborhoods or intersection neighborhoods based on different thresholds. Meanwhile, the lower approximation operator using in the computing positive regions can be focused on element or elementary set.SGS_PRGR algorithm can make full use of the result in gene pre-selection and avoid the waste of time and resources caused by computing heuristic information in the process of attribute reduction. Meanwhile, the way of selecting genes in this algorithm is getting rid of redundant genes from the whole set gradually, so it makes a better use of global information than those methods which are adding genes to the reduction subset.The computational complexity of SGS_PRGR algorithm is analyzed for different neighborhoods and different approximation operators. For two kinds of approximation operators, the complexity is the same, while it is influenced by different neighborhoods. The complexity is mainly governed by Step 1 and Step 5. For δ neighborhood, the complexity of Step 1 is O(|S|2|G|), and Step 5 is O(|S|2|G|2), where |S| is the number of samples in S and |G| is the number of genes in G. So, the complexity is O(|S|2|G|2) finally. For intersection neighborhood, the complexity of Step 1 is O(|S|2|G|), and Step 5 is O(|S||G|2). Generally, |G|>|S| in gene expression data, so the complexity is O(|S||G|2) for intersection neighborhood. In conclusion, the computational complexity of SGS_PRGR algorithm for intersection neighborhood is lower than δ neighborhood.A main characteristic of intersection neighborhood is that there can be different thresholds for different attributes. However, it may cause a combinatorial explosion of thresholds to find the best threshold for each gene in order to obtain the best reduction gene subset. Two characteristics of a better reduction gene subset are: (1) with well ability of classification; (2) to be of small cardinality. They are conflicting with respect to each other to some extent. A compromise is necessary for getting the optimum solution. In addition, it is difficult to construct a single objective function based on the two characteristics, because there is a significant difference between the value ranges of the two criterions. Multi-objective optimization is a good solution for this problem. A popular multi-objective optimization algorithm, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII), has been employed to address similar optimization problems in gene selection [38]. We introduce NSGAII into thresholds optimization in this section.NSGAII was proposed by Deb et al. [39], and three main components of NSGAII were introduced in the following.(1) A fast non-dominated sorting procedure: An important concept is stated that an individual p dominates another individual q, denoted by p≺q, if and only if all objects of p are superior to those of q or same as those at least. The main idea of non-dominated sorting procedure is to distribute individuals into different non-dominated fronts and assign a rank for each front. The major steps of the fast non-dominated sorting are shown in Algorithm 4.1.Algorithm 4.1Fast non-dominated sorting(P)(2) A crowded comparison operator: Crowded comparison is employed in selecting individuals to construct the new population, in order to maintain a good spread of individuals in the obtained population. Density estimation metric, called crowding distance, is calculated for each individual using Algorithm 4.2.Algorithm 4.2Crowding distance assignment(P)As each individual p is associated with a non-domination rank(prank) and a crowding distance(pdistance), the crowded comparison operator is denoted by a partial order ≺nand defined as i≺nj if (irank<jrank) or (irank=jrankand idistance>jdistance).(3) An elitist preserving approach: Elitist preserving approach is employed to maintain elitist individuals preserved in new population. For a parent population Ptof size N, the offspring population Qtof size N is created after using selection, recombination and mutation operators on Pt. Elitist preserving approach is used to select better individuals from Ptand Qtto construct a new population Pt+1 of size N based on Algorithm 4.3.Algorithm 4.3Elitist preserved selectingInput:Pt, QtOutput:Pt+1Step 1.Combine parent and offspring population to Rt=Pt∪Qt.Step 2.Get all non-dominated fronts F=Fast non-dominated sorting(Rt).Step 3.Set Pt+1=∅, and counter i=1.Step 4.While |Pt+1|+|Fi|≤N, add all individuals in Fito Pt+1, and increase i by 1.Step 5.Crowding distance assignment(Fi).Step 6.Sort all individuals in Fiby the crowded comparison operator.Step 7.Add the top (N−|Pt+1|) individuals in Fito Pt+1, to make sure the size of Pt+1 is N.The procedure of NSGAII is creating a random parent population P0 initially, then iterating Algorithm 4.3 on Pt(t=0,1,…) until the ending condition is met. The last population is the optimized result of NSGAII.We introduce NSGAII to optimize thresholds in SGS_PRGR algorithm. In order to speed up the convergence of the algorithm, a minor adjustment is made in Algorithm 4.2. We set P[d1]distancincreased by (fk[2]−fk[1])/(fk[l]−fk[1]), and P[dl]distanceincreased by (fk[l]−fk[l−1])/(fk[l]−fk[1]).In gene selection, there are two objects: (1) the number of selected genes after reduction, and (2) classification accuracy of the selected genes. We choose a real value string of length equal to the number of genes after pre-selection to code the chromosome for each individual. Each position in chromosome is associated with a real value with the range of 0–1 (except 0) as the threshold of the corresponding gene. The SGS_PRGR algorithm with thresholds optimization (SGS_PRGR_TO) is shown in Algorithm 4.4. Pnum_genis the result of optimization and RED_List is the result of gene selection. This algorithm takes more time as NSGAII is an iteration process. How to improve the approach of thresholds optimization needs to be further studied.Algorithm 4.4SGS_PRGR_TO algorithmHere, selection, recombination and mutation operators are introduced as follows:(1)Selection operator: select two individuals from parent population randomly, and then add the individual with a smaller rank of front into the new population. Repeat these steps until the size of new population is equal to that of parent population.Recombination operator: the population is split into groups of two individuals. For each group, create a random floating number between 0 and 1; if the number is less than crossover probability (p_cross), the two individuals can be recombined. For each position in chromosome, create a random floating number between 0 and 1; if the number is <0.5, the values on the same position in chromosomes of the two individuals are exchanged with each other.Mutation operator: for each position in chromosome of each individual, create a random floating number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than mutation probability (p_mut), the value on this position is changed to a random floating number between 0 and 1.To analyze the computational complexity of SGS_PRGR_TO algorithm, some basic operations in NSGAII and their computational complexities are listed at first [39]: (1) fast nondominated sorting procedure is O(MN2), here M is the number of objective functions, and N is the size of population; (2) crowding distance assignment is O(MNlog(N)); (3) sorting based on crowded comparison operator is O(Nlog(N)); (4) elitist preserved selecting is O(M(2N)2). In addition, for intersection neighborhood, the computational complexity of SGS_PRGR algorithm is O(|S||G|2).In SGS_PRGR_TO algorithm, the computational complexity is mainly governed by Step 2, Step 3, and Step 5. Step 2 calls SGS_PRGR algorithm, and its complexity is O(N|S||G|2); Step 3 is fast nondominated sorting procedure, and its complexity is O(MN2); Step 5 calls SGS_PRGR algorithm and elitist preserved selecting, so its complexity is O(I(N|S||G|2+M(2N)2)), here I is the number of genetic iteration. In this optimization problem, the number of objective functions is a fixed number, M=2. In conclusion, the computational complexity of SGS_PRGR_TO algorithm is O(IN|S||G|2).It is significant for agronomic research to select genes of plants which are associated with resisting to various stresses. In this section, the proposed methods were applied to four data sets on plant stress response. The experimental results were evaluated with measure criterion and biological explanations.Four gene expression data sets obtained by biological experiments were downloaded from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Both two data sets are about Arabidopsis thaliana. One is resisting to drought stress, named ArabidopsisDrought for short (GEO Accession ID: GSE27548). The other is response to Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV), named ArabidopsisTEV for short (GEO Accession ID: GSE37269), A data set about Populus trees contending with drought, named PopulusDroughtP for short, consists of 36 samples which are selected based on the time point predawn from NCBI GEO (GSE21171). The last data set about Hordeum vulgare responding to stem rust, named HordeumSRQxSM for short, consists of 150 QxSM doubled-haploid samples (GEO Accession ID: GSE20416). Each data set has two classes, the experimental group and the control group, denoted by Class1 and Class2, respectively. The detail descriptions of four data sets are shown in Table 1.SGS_PRGR algorithm was applied to four data sets, experimental methods and results were stated in detail in the following.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Gene selection using rough set model based on neighborhood is an effective approach for the analysis of plant stress response. How to construct neighborhoods to suit for various data structures, and design more effective attribute reduction algorithm, are problems to be solved. We study the three key components in this approach: construction of neighborhoods, approximation operators and attribute reduction algorithm. Firstly, we defined intersection neighborhood which allows different attributes with different thresholds. Intersection neighborhood is confirmed to be more flexible to adapt to data with various structure by theoretical analysis and experiments. Secondly, we concluded that the approximation operator based on elementary set was more suitable for this application than that based on element, because the performance of the former was better than that of latter in most cases. Finally, we proposed two algorithms, SGS_PRGR and SGS_PRGR_TO, and applied them to the analysis of plant stress response. Compared with other related methods, classical algorithms (mRMR and ReliefF) and rough set algorithms (RSMRMS). Experimental results on four data sets demonstrated that the proposed algorithms were effective, as they could select significant gene subsets without redundancy and achieve high classification accuracy. How to improve the approach of thresholds optimization will be further studied in our future works. Our work will get more meaningful conclusions on the analysis of plant stress response with the increase of gene expression datasets.
