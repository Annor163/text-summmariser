@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the present paper, a three-dimensional elasticity approach is employed to investigate buckling of heterogeneous functionally graded plates under biaxial compression, shear, tension-compression, and shear-compression load conditions. In this regard, a formulation that employs a full compatible three-dimensional Hermitian element with 168 degrees of freedom and guarantees continuity of the strain and stress components is used. It is known that all of the available famous commercial finite element softwares and the proposed series solutions satisfy continuity conditions of the displacement rather than the stress components. Buckling occurrence is detected based on checking both the instability onset and equilibrium criteria. Results are extracted based on a Galerkin-type orthogonality. Therefore, they are more accurate than those obtained based on the traditional Ritz method. The presented three-dimensional finite element analysis and the extracted results are quite new. A vast variety of results including results of biaxial compression, compression-tension, shear, and shear-compression load cases is considered and discussed in detail.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Plate-type structural components are extensively used in majority of the engineering structures, among them, those employed in aerospace, naval, power plant, mechanical, civil, and ground vehicle structures. Due to the optimization targets frequently considered in these components, to minimize the costs, weights, fuel consumption, etc., these components may be vulnerable to sever in-plane loads (e.g., compression, shear, or a combination of them). Therefore, reliability of design of such components requires carefully evaluating the buckling loads which can heavily limit the allowable bearing capacity.Majority of the available researches on the buckling of the rectangular plates have mainly been performed for isotropic or composite plates. Shariyat investigated static and dynamic mechanical, thermal, and thermo-electromechanical buckling and postbuckling of the composite and sandwich plates, employing higher-order, layerwise, and global–local plate theories [1–6]. Shen [7,8] and Shen et al. [9,10] used the classical plate theory and a perturbation technique for buckling and postbuckling analysis of the simply supported, laminated rectangular composite plates under biaxial compressive loadings. They used a Galerkin perturbation technique to determine the buckling and post-buckling equilibrium paths of laminated plates with or without elastic foundations. Zhong and Zhang [11] studied dynamic buckling, post-buckling, and mode jumping behaviors of clamped angle-ply laminated composite plates under biaxial compression.Majority of the available buckling studies on flat plates undergoing mechanical loads have been accomplished under axial or biaxial compressive loads. Nevertheless, some few researchers have investigated buckling of plates under shear loads. Budiansky [12] studied shear buckling of the isotropic clamped rectangular plates. Smith et al. [13] presented a Rayleigh–Ritz method for local buckling analysis of rectangular unilaterally restrained plates in pure shear, using the classical plate theory. Azikov [14] investigated buckling of composite plates subjected to combined in-plane compression and shear. Loughlan [15] examined effect of the bend-twist coupling on the shear buckling behavior of the laminated composite plates using a finite strip procedure and the classical plate theory. Kim et al. [16] carried out a buckling and postbuckling analysis for composite plates under pure shear. Han et al. [17] studied postbuckling behavior of laminated composite plates under the combination of in-plane shear, compression and lateral loading, using a Lagrangian finite element-based formulation and the first-order shear-deformation plate theory. Lopatin and Korbut [18] studied buckling of clamped orthotropic laminated plates under shear loads, based on the classical plate theory. Chirica and Beznea [19] analyzed influence of the initial delaminations on buckling behavior of composite plates under shear and compression loadings numerically and experimentally. Explicit expressions were developed by Tarján et al. [20] for buckling analysis of long rectangular plates with constrained edges under shear and linearly varying axial loads, using Rayleigh-Ritz method. Wu and Nie [21] studied shear buckling of the steel-concrete composite slabs considering influence of the interface shear stiffness. The buckling and fracture collapse mechanisms in an elastic rectangular thin-plate with a central straight crack under shear loading were analyzed by Brighenti and Carpinteri [22], for different boundary conditions. An analytical solution was established by Yang et al. [23] for shear buckling of anisotropic rectangular thin plates having arbitrary boundary conditions along their edges or at their corners. Few studies may be found in literature on buckling analysis of the rectangular heterogeneous functionally graded plates [24–28]. Postbuckling analysis of functionally graded plates under edge compression and temperature field conditions was presented by Lee et al. [29], using the element-free Ritz method, the first-order shear-deformation plate theory, and a von Kármán-type nonlinear strain–displacement relationship.Very rare buckling analyses have been presented so far based on the general three-dimensional theory of elasticity [30] or based on a three-dimensional elasticity with a uniform prebuckling stress assumption [31] which is equivalent to the membrane assumption used in plate theories. Uymaz and Aydogdu studied mechanical buckling of rectangular functionally graded plates under biaxial [32] and shear [33] loads and different boundary conditions. The analyses were performed based on the linear strain energy concept and Ritz method. The displacement components were described by Chebyshev polynomials.In the present paper, a three-dimensional elasticity approach is employed to investigate buckling of heterogeneous functionally graded plates under biaxial compression, shear, tension-compression, and shear-compression load conditions. It is known that plates fabricated from transversely-graded materials generally have asymmetric material distributions. Recently, the authors [34] have proposed graded finite element and boundary element formulations that are capable of accurately tracing variations of the material properties within the body and consequently, obtaining relatively accurate results. In the present research, this formulation is extended further to present a Hermitian graded finite element formulation that guarantees continuity of the strain and stress components. It is known that all of the available famous commercial finite element softwares employ elements that are mainly suitable for homogeneous materials and satisfy the continuity condition of the displacement rather than the stress components. On the other hand, since present results are extracted based on a Galerkin-type orthogonality, they are more accurate than those obtained based on the traditional Ritz method. Buckling analysis is performed in the present research on the basis of checking both the instability and equilibrium criteria. A wide diversity of examples is considered in the present research to extract more practical conclusions.Let us consider a functionally graded rectangular plate whose length, width, and thickness are denoted by a, b, and h, respectively (Fig. 1).As Fig. 1 shows, the plate may be subjected to biaxial compression, in-plane shear or a combination of them. It is assumed that the plate is fabricated from a functionally graded material that is a mixture of two constituent materials, e.g., a metal and a ceramic. The volume fraction of the metallic constituent material is assumed to vary across the thickness according to the following power law:(1)Vm=(zh)nwhere n is the positive-definite volume fraction index and the z coordinate is measured from the bottom surface of the plate. Therefore, if the subscripts c and m stand respectively for the ceramic and metal, the following distribution may be assigned for the elasticity modulus through the thickness of the plate [35]:(2)E=Ec+(Em−Ec)(zh)nThe plate is discretized using full compatible Hermitian-type elements with 21 degrees of freedom defined in each node. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom of the element is 168. The u, v, and w displacement components are defined along the x, y, and z directions, respectively. In Hermitian elements, the first-order derivatives of the displacement components are usually defined to guarantee continuity of the strain components and in turn, continuity of the stress components. The available well-known commercial finite element softwares employ Lagrangian elements with nodal degrees of freedom that contain only the displacement components.To ensure that the derivatives as well as the integrals are path-independent, the second-order mixed derivatives of the displacement components are also defined in the nodal points, in the present research. To present a general approach, the initial elements are mapped into the natural coordinate system, first. In the current special case, coordinatesξ,η, andζof this system are located along the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively (Fig. 2). It is known that value of each natural coordinate varies between −1 and 1. Therefore, the following degrees of freedom are defined at each node of the present full compatible three-dimensional solid element:(3)u,u,ξ,u,η,u,ζ,u,ξη,u,ξζ,u,ηζ,v,v,ξ,v,η,v,ζ,v,ξη,v,ξζ,v,ηζ,w,w,ξ,w,η,w,ζ,w,ξη,w,ξζ,w,ηζwhere the comma symbol stands for partial derivative. The associated nodal degrees of freedom are denoted by (Fig. 2):(4)U,U,ξ,U,η,U,ζ,U,ξη,U,ξζ,U,ηζ,V,V,ξ,V,η,V,ζ,V,ξη,V,ξζ,V,ηζ,W,W,ξ,W,η,W,ζ,W,ξη,W,ξζ,W,ηζAs Fig. 2 shows, the element has only two nodal points along each side. Therefore, p-refinement instead of h-refinement is used. In such cases, accuracy of the results may be enhanced drastically. So that in some circumstances, number of elements of a Lagrangian mesh (the common mesh of the commercial finite element softwares) may be reduced to less than one hundredth of the original number through using the p-refinement, to achieve the same accuracy [36,37]. Shape functions of each element may be obtained based on the concept of separation of variables. Denoting the nodes, in accordance with each coordinate (in each direction) by 1 and 2 if value of the mentioned coordinate is −1 and 1, respectively, one may express interpolation functions of a representative displacementφ(that can be u, v, or w) in the following form [38]:(5)φ(ξ,η,ζ)=∑j=17[N1jΦj+N2j(Φ,ξ)j+N3j(Φ,η)j+N4j(Φ,ζ)j+N5j(Φ,ξη)j+N6j(Φ,ξζ)j+N7j(Φ,ηζ)j]=NΦwhere(6)N1j(ξ,η,ζ)=H0jξ(ξ)H0jη(η)H0jζ(ζ),N2j(ξ,η,ζ)=H1jξ(ξ)H0jη(η)H0jζ(ζ),N3j(ξ,η,ζ)=H0jξ(ξ)H1jη(η)H0jζ(ζ),N4j(ξ,η,ζ)=H0jξ(ξ)H0jη(η)H1jζ(ζ),N5j(ξ,η,ζ)=H1jξ(ξ)H1jη(η)H0jζ(ζ),N6j(ξ,η,ζ)=H1jξ(ξ)H0jη(η)H1jζ(ζ),N7j(ξ,η,ζ)=H0jξ(ξ)H1jη(η)H1jζ(ζ),ΦT=〈ΦΦ,ξΦ,ηΦ,ζΦ,ξηΦ,ξζΦ,ηζ〉and for example [38]:(7)H0jξ(ξ)=14(ξ+ξj)2(2−ξξj)H1jξ(ξ)=14ξj(ξ+ξj)2(ξξj−1)whereH0andH1functions are the one-dimensional Hermitian shape functions with respect to the correspondence to the quantity and its first derivative, respectively. Therefore,(8)δ={uvw}=[N000N000N]{UVW}=ℕ{δ}(e)where(9)UT=〈UU,ξU,ηU,ζU,ξηU,ξζU,ηζ〉,VT=〈VV,ξV,ηV,ζV,ξηV,ξζV,ηζ〉,WT=〈WW,ξW,ηW,ζW,ξηW,ξζW,ηζ〉Governing equations of the elements may be obtained based on the principle of minimum total potential energy. According to this principle, the following condition is required for a physically possible configuration:(10)δΠ=δU−δW=0where U and W are respectively, the strain energy and work of the externally applied loads:(11)δU=∫ΩδεTσdΩδW=∫Γ(σ⌢xδu+σ⌢yδv+τ⌢xyδut)dΓwhereσ⌢ijare the externally imposed tractions of the edges.ΩandΓare the volume and boundary surface of the element, respectively andutis the tangential displacement component. In the prebuckling state, the displacements may be considered to be small. Consequently, the strain and stress vectors may be related to the displacement vector through the following relations:(12)ε=dδ=dℕδ(e)=Bδ(e),σ=Dε=DBδ(e),where(13)ε=〈εxεyεzγxyγxzγyz〉,σ=〈σxσyσzτxyτxzτyz〉where d is a matrix containing partial differentiation operations:(14)d=[∂x000∂y000∂z∂y∂x0∂z0∂x0∂z∂y]andDis the elasticity coefficients matrix:(15)D−1=1E[1−ν−ν000−ν1−ν000−ν−ν10000002(1+ν)0000002(1+ν)0000002(1+ν)]Therefore, one may write:(16)δU=∫ΩδεTσdΩ=δδ(e)T(∫ΩBTDBdΩ)δ(e)=δδ(e)TKδ(e)To develop the governing equations of the instability (buckling), one may use the following relation that relates the condition of the buckling onset to that of the prebuckling state (Eq. 10):(17)δ(δΠ)=δ2Π=0Therefore, based on Eqs. (16), and (17):(18)δδ(e)TKδδ(e)+δ2ΠExt.=0Generally, the strain vector contains linear and non-linear terms:(19)ε=εL+εNL=dδ+εNL=Bδ(e)+εNLwhere(20)εNL={12(u,x2+v,x2+w,x2)12(u,y2+v,y2+w,y2)12(u,z2+v,z2+w,z2)u,xu,y+v,xv,y+w,xw,yu,xu,z+v,xv,z+w,xw,zu,yu,z+v,yv,z+w,yw,z}Therefore, the general strain energy of the structure contains linear as well as nonlinear terms of the strain-displacement terms:(21)U=12∫ΩεTσdΩ=12∫Ω(εL+εNL)TσdΩIn the prebuckling state, no transverse displacements or large deformations exist. Therefore, only the linear strain components appear. Since slope of the plate is not zero at the buckling state, the nonlinear terms of the strain-displacement expressions have to be considered. On the other hand, from Eq. (10) or directly from the principle of minimum total potential energy:(22)δU=δWorU=WTherefore, the following expression appears only after buckling:(23)U=ΠExt.=12∫ΩεNLTσdΩSince in the onset of the buckling occurrence:(24)σij=σ⌢ijat the boundaries, Eq. (23) may be rewritten in the following expanded form, based on Eq. (19):(25)U=ΠExt.=14∫ΩGTSGdΩwhere(26)GT=〈w,xw,yu,xu,yv,xv,y〉=δ(e)TΞTS=[σ⌢xτ⌢xy0000τ⌢xyσ⌢y000000σ⌢xτ⌢xy0000τ⌢xyσ⌢y000000σ⌢xτ⌢xy0000τ⌢xyσ⌢y]or:(27)ΠExt.=12∫ΩGTSGdΩ=12δ(e)T(∫ΩΞTSΞdΩ)δ(e)Hence, based on Eqs. (18) and (27):(28)δ2Π=δδ(e)TKδδ(e)+δδ(e)T(∫ΩΞTSΞdΩ)δδ(e)=0or in a compact form:(29)δδ(e)T(K+KG)δδ(e)=0KGis the so-called geometric stiffness matrix. Eq. (29) may be rewritten in the following Rayleigh quotient form [37]:(30)δδ(e)TKδδ(e)δδ(e)TKGδδ(e)=−λ⌢whereλ⌢>1indicates instability occurrence.Noting thatδδ(e)≠0, the following governing equation of instability is obtained from Eq. (29):(31)(K+KG)δδ(e)=0Existence of nonzero solution requires that:(32)|K+KG|=0The load amplification factor may be defined as(33)σijCr=λCrσ⌢ijIn this regard, one may use Eq. (33) for all or only one component(s) of the stress components appeared in Eq. (26). If this equation is used for one stress component only, other stress components may be considered as prestresses. Therefore, Eq. (32) leads to the following equation:(34)F(λCr)=0For example, when biaxial normal stresses are imposed on the plate, one may write:(35)S=λCrσ⌢x[1000000β0000001000000β0000001000000β]=λCrσ⌢xβ⌢where(36)β=σ⌢y/σ⌢xThe same results may be obtained based on concept of virtual displacement variations about the buckling state. Based on Eqs. (16) and (28), the expanded form of Eq. (34) may be written as(37)∫ΩBTDBdΩ+λCr∫ΩΞTσ⌢xβ⌢ΞdΩ=0To achieve a computationally economic algorithm, Eq. (31) has to be rewritten in a condensed form before commencing the solution process, as explained in Section 4.Some of the quantities appeared in Fig. 2 cannot be determined directly. On the other hand, if all degrees of freedom of the element appear in the final governing system of equations, huge numerical computations will be required. In the present research, we used the condensation technique to minimize size of the final system of equations [36]. Indeed, if the degrees of freedom are categorized as those that can be determined directly (Θ1) and those that cannot be determined directly (i.e., terms containing the second derivatives of the displacement quantities)(Θ2):(38)Θ1=〈UU,ξU,ηU,ζVV,ξV,ηV,ζWW,ξW,ηW,ζ〉Θ2=〈U,ξηU,ξζU,ηζV,ξηV,ξζV,ηζW,ξηW,ξζW,ηζ〉one may rewrite Eq. (31) as(39)(K+KG)δδ(e)=0⇒Kδδ(e)=0[K11K12K21K22]{δΘ1δΘ2}={00}Therefore, from lower part of the resulting system of equations, one may infer:(40)δΘ2=−K22−1K21δΘ1Hence, effect of the nodal second order derivative quantities may be interpreted or substituted by other nodal quantities (Θ1). Substituting Eq. (40) into the upper part of the system of equations appeared in Eq. (39), leads to(41)(K11−K12K22−1K21)δΘ1=0which requires that(42)|K11−K12K22−1K21|=0Therefore, the resulting condensed system includes influence of all nodal quantities (Θ1andΘ2). Elements of theΘ1vector may be adopted according to the displacement-based boundary conditions. For example, for movable clamped edges, the following boundary conditions may be used for the biaxial compressive loading:(43)x=0,a:v,v,η,v,ζ,w,w,η,w,ζ,τxy=0,σx=−σ⌢xy=0,b:u,u,ξ,u,ζ,w,w,ξ,w,ζ,τxy=0,σy=−σ⌢yFor shear loading, the following conditions may be used instead:(44)x=0,a:w,w,η,w,ζ,τxy=τ⌢xyy=0,b:w,w,ξ,w,ζ,τxy=τ⌢xyin addition to the conditions that prevent rigid body motion of the plate.For simply supported edges, only displacements of the reference plane, e.g., the neutral plane or mid-surface of the plate, have to be set equal to zero.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In the present paper, a three-dimensional elasticity approach is employed to investigate buckling of heterogeneous functionally graded plates under biaxial compression, shear, tension-compression, and shear-compression load conditions. Some of the novelties of the present research are:(i)A full three-dimensional formulation that considers the instability as well as the equilibrium conditions, is employed. Majority of the available researches have been accomplished based on the approximate plate theories.A full three-dimensional Hermitian element with 168 degrees of freedom including second-order partial differential derivatives of the displacement components is employed. Complexity of the computations reduced significantly through using an adequate condensation technique.In contrast to the available finite element and series solutions (among them, the series solutions presented for the elasticity problems), the present solution is a C1-continuous rather than C0-continuous one. In other words, in contrast to the available solutions, present solution guarantees continuity of the stress components in addition to continuity of the displacement components.Results are extracted based on a Galerkin-type orthogonality.A vast variety of results including results of biaxial compression, compression-tension, shear, and shear-compression load cases are considered and discussed in detail.
