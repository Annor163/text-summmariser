Understanding leaves in natural images – A model-based approach for tree species identification

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We use a global shape model to segment leaves in complex natural images.Prior knowledge and shape constraints improve segmentation performance.We designed explicit botany-inspired descriptors for local shapes.Information is combined to classify leaf images into a list of species.Dedicated high-level features prove to perform better than generic statistical ones.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
With the aim of elaborating a mobile application, accessible to anyone and with educational purposes, we present a method for tree species identification that relies on dedicated algorithms and explicit botany-inspired descriptors. Focusing on the analysis of leaves, we developed a working process to help recognize species, starting from a picture of a leaf in a complex natural background. A two-step active contour segmentation algorithm based on a polygonal leaf model processes the image to retrieve the contour of the leaf. Features we use afterwards are high-level geometrical descriptors that make a semantic interpretation possible, and prove to achieve better performance than more generic and statistical shape descriptors alone. We present the results, both in terms of segmentation and classification, considering a database of 50 European broad-leaved tree species, and an implementation of the system is available in the iPhone application Folia.1https://itunes.apple.com/app/folia/id547650203.1Advances in technology and prevalence of urban settlement undoubtedly contributed to widen a gap between nature and us that was inconceivable a couple of generations ago. Along the triumphant march of alleged progress, we carelessly dropped the knowledge of many plants, trees and herbs that used to be found in our most immediate environment. Knowing how to recognize a plant, and what uses it may provide, is now the mere privilege of a handful of specialists. Today however, with the growing awareness that nature’s diversity ought to be treasured, the need to regain some touch with this knowledge never felt so present.Books are available to the neophyte, but when it comes to precise species identification, it is easy to get lost in the bushy floras, without the minimal theoretical background. However, with the rise of mobile applications that have the potential, yet scarecely exploited, to place powerful resources in everyone’s pocket, the access to such knowledge can be made much more intuitive and flexible for anyone who feels the need. Recently, attempts in this direction have come to light with great success, being with user-based (TreeId,2http://isoperla.co.uk/TreeIdiPhone.html.2Fleurs en Poche3http://www.antiopa.info/fleursenpoche.htm.3) or automatic recognition (LeafSnap4http://leafsnap.com: developed by researchers from Columbia University, the University of Maryland, and the Smithsonian Institution [1].4) on white background images.Leaves are the most obvious and widespread choice for tree species recognition, even though the botanical classification was not built upon their properties. They can be found almost all year long, are easy to photograph, and their shapes present well studied specificities that make the identification, if not trivial, possible. Our goal with the Folia application is then to build a system for leaf shape analysis that processes, unlike what has been done to date, pictures in a natural environment. With the aim of being an educational tool, it relies on high-level geometric criteria inspired by those used by botanists, that make a semantic interpretation possible, to classify a leaf into a list of species.In this paper, we propose an attempt for such a system. Other works tackling similar challenges are presented in Section 2, and a global view of our system is presented in Section 3. Section 4 introduces the color model we use for segmentation, and Section 5 expounds the leaf model estimation, and the subsequent active contour segmentation algorithm. Section 6 details the leaf-specific contour descriptors we introduce. The classification method we use and its results are shown in Section 7 and perspectives of our work are discussed in Section 8.
