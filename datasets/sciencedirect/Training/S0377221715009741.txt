@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The bin packing problem with precedence constraints (BPP-P) is a recently proposed variation of the classical bin packing problem (BPP), which corresponds to a basic model featuring many underlying characteristics of several scheduling and assembly line balancing problems. The formulation builds upon the BPP by incorporating precedence constraints among items, which force successor items to be packed into later bins than their predecessors.In this paper we propose a dynamic programming based heuristic, and a modified exact enumeration procedure to solve the problem. These methods make use of several new lower bounds and dominance rules tailored for the problem in hand. The results of a computational experiment show the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which are able to close all of the previous open instances from the benchmark instance set within very reduced running times.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The bin packing problem with precedence constraints (BPP-P) can be described as follows: a set of items, each with a non-negative weight, has to be packed into consecutively numbered bins, each with an identical capacity that limits the total weight of the items packed into the bin. Each item also presents a set of precedence relations: that is, items that need to be packed into a lower numbered bin than the item in question. The objective of the problem is to find the lowest number of bins accepting a packing of items such that all capacity constraints and precedence relations are satisfied.The BPP-P is a closely related problem to two classical problems: (1) it can be seen as an extension of the bin packing problem in which strict precedence constraints have been incorporated; and (2) it corresponds to the simple assembly line balancing problem (SALBP-1) with a different definition of the precedence relations.The SALBP-1 is a basic formulation of the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP). ALBPs try to find an optimal assignment of tasks (the items) among the workstations (the bins) so as to maximize the efficiency of the line. In the SALBP-1, tasks have an operation time (their weight); the workstations have a maximum allotted time to perform the tasks equal to the cycle time (the capacity of the bin); the precedence constraints represent technological constraints that require some tasks to be performed after other tasks have been finished; and the efficiency of the line is measured by minimizing the number of workstations required (the number of bins). The main difference between the SALBP-1 and the BPP-P is the rendition of the precedence constraints: that is, while the precedence relations in the SALBP-1 correspond to inequality constraints (≤), the precedence constraint in BPP-P correspond to strict inequality constraints (<).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this work we have investigated the bin packing problem with precedence constraints, a recently proposed generalization of the bin packing problem, (Dell’Amico et al., 2012), which models some characteristics of several scheduling and assembly line balancing problems. In order to provide a solution procedure for the problem, two lower bounds derived from the simple assembly line balancing problem as well as a dynamic programming based heuristic and an branch, bound and remember enumeration method are proposed. Both methods explore the state space of the dynamic programming formulation avoiding the repeated exploration of equivalent partial solutions. Furthermore, the dynamic programming heuristic and the enumeration method are designed in such a way that the same solution space is explored and the portions of the solution space already explored by the dynamic programming approach are not explored again by the branch, bound and remember method.In addition to the application of novel lower bounds and the identification of equivalent partial solutions in the state space, both methods make use of different dominance rules to detect dominated states. The early detection of these dominated states allows the algorithm to reduce the number of states stored in memory, and to avoid redundant exploration. In addition to their usefulness for the present problem, two of the novel dominance rules, namely the generalized maximum load rule and the generalized item dominance rule, can be extended to some assembly line balancing problems, like the simple assembly line balancing problem.The results show the effectiveness of the proposed final method, which is able to solve all of the previously considered instances, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art procedure from the literature. A second computational experiment is conducted in order to identify the characteristics of the instances which pose difficulties to the proposed method. While the proposed method does not obtain the optimal solution for all of the instances in the second set, the results indicate that most instances are still solved to optimality. Furthermore, the results of this second computational experiment show that the most difficult instances for the algorithm correspond to those with large item weights and low order strength on the precedence graph.As a final reflection, we would like to draw attention to some of the ideas of the proposed method, like the dominance rules, which can be generalized to similar problems, like the assembly line or the transfer line balancing problem. It is our opinion that the ability of the method to share the explored state space between the heuristic and the exact phases of the algorithm, constitutes a good starting point to develop efficient solution methods for problems featuring similar characteristics.This research has been partially funded by the research grant “Heterogeneous assembly line balancing problems with process selection features” number 1150306, from the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico of the Ministry of Education of Chile.
