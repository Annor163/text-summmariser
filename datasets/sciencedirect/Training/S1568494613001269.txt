@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Understanding the weaknesses and the limitations of existing digital fingerprinting schemes and designing effective collusion attacks play an important role in the development of digital fingerprinting. In this paper, we propose a collusion attack optimization framework for spread-spectrum (SS) fingerprinting. Our framework is based upon the closed-loop feedback control theory. In the framework, we at first define a measure function to test whether the fingerprint presents in the attacked signal after collusion. Then, an optimization mechanism is introduced to attenuate the fingerprints from the forgery. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework for three different SS-based embedding methods. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is more effective than the other examined collusion attacks. About three pieces of fingerprinted content are able to interrupt the fingerprinting system which accommodates about 1000 users, if we require the detection probability to be less than 0.9. Meanwhile, a high fidelity of the attacked content is retained.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Digital fingerprinting technology has proven to be very successful in protecting multimedia content from unauthorized redistribution. Unique marks, known as fingerprints, are embedded in the content which is used to identify adversaries who leak the copies of the same content. Collusion attack is known to be a cost-effective attack, whereby a group of users combines their copies to generate a new version. With enough number of collected copies, the adversaries are able to attenuate or even to fully remove the fingerprints, which results in the detector being unable to trace any of the involved colluders. Therefore, an improperly designed fingerprinting scheme may lead to missing the opportunity of tracing an illegal copy, even one generated by a small coalition of colluders.
