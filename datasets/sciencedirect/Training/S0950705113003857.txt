@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Natural data sets often have missing values in them. An accurate missing value imputation is crucial to increase the usability of a data set for statistical analyses and data mining tasks. In this paper we present a novel missing value imputation technique using a data set’s existing patterns including co-appearances of attribute values, correlations among the attributes and similarity of values belonging to an attribute. Our technique can impute both numerical and categorical missing values. We carry out extensive experiments on nine natural data sets, and compare our technique with four high quality existing techniques. We simulate 32 types of missing patterns (combinations), and thereby generate 320 missing data sets for each of the nine natural data sets. Two well known evaluation criteria namely index of agreement(d2)and root mean squared error are used. Our experimental results, based on the statistical sign test, indicate that our technique achieves significantly better imputation accuracy than the existing techniques.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Natural data sets often have missing values in them. The imputation of missing values as accurately as possible is an important data pre-processing task. A number of techniques have been proposed in literature for imputing missing values [1–6].An early approach is to use the mean of all available values of the attribute, having a missing value [7], as an imputed value. Another initial approach to deal with missing values of a data set is to remove the records having missing value/s [8]. Mean imputation can generate more erroneous outputs than the simple record deletion approach [9]. However, the deletion of records may also reduce the usefulness of a data set for a statistical analysis and data mining [9].A more advanced approach called “Expectation–Maximization (EMI)” [1] relies on correlations between attributes and mean values of the attributes. A record may have some missing values and available values. EMI considers that the deviation of a missing value (belonging to an attribute) from the mean value of the attribute is proportional to the deviation of an available value (belonging to another attribute) from the mean value of the second attribute.In order to impute a missing value EMI uses the whole data set, whereas another recent technique called IBLLS [5] divides a data set in both horizontal and vertical segments by identifying k-most similar records and correlated attributes, respectively. It then locally imputes a missing value by applying a framework [4] within each segment separately. However, EMI and IBLLS impute only numerical missing values.In this paper, we propose a novel imputation technique called A Framework for Imputing Missing Values Using Co-Appearance, Correlation and Similarity Analysis (FIMUS). The basic idea of the technique is to make an educated guess based on the co-appearances of the values, correlations between attributes and similarity of values belonging to an attribute. Moreover, unlike many existing techniques [1,5] FIMUS is also capable of imputing categorical missing values, in addition to numerical missing values.We evaluate FIMUS on nine natural data sets [10] by comparing its performance with the performance of four high quality existing techniques namely DMI [6], SVR [11], EMI [1] and IBLLS [5]. Two evaluation criteria called index of agreement(d2), and root mean squared error(RMSE)are used. Our experimental results indicate (based on statistical sign test) that FIMUS performs significantly better than DMI, SVR, EMI and IBLLS on all data sets.The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents some related works on missing value imputation. Our technique (FIMUS) is presented in Section 3. Section 4 presents empirical evaluations, and Section 5 gives concluding remarks.
