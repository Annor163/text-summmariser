@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a multi-item solid transportation problem with parameters, e.g., transportation costs, supplies and demands as type-2 triangular fuzzy variables is formulated. In this problem there are restrictions on some items and conveyances so that some specific items cannot be transported through some particular conveyances. With the critical value (CV)-based reductions of type-2 fuzzy variables, a chance-constrained programming model is formulated for the problem and then this model is converted to an equivalent deterministic form. Here, we propose a method to find nearest interval approximations for continuous type-2 fuzzy variables. A deterministic form for the problem is also obtained by applying interval analysis using the interval approximations of continuous type-2 fuzzy variables. The reduced deterministic problems are solved using a gradient based optimization – Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) technique (using LINGO solver) and Genetic Algorithm. Numerical example is provided to illustrate the problem and methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Making decisions and solving problems are key to decisive management. In real life problem solving situation, with the available resources, a decision maker has to take decisions as better as possible in favour of the company/organization's benefit. Making right decision is not always easy tusk and it becomes more difficult when various types of uncertainties appear in the available information. In decision making problems like transportation, the possible values of the system parameters can not be always exactly determined. For example, transportation cost depends upon fuel price, labour charges, tax charges, etc., each of which fluctuates from time to time. So it is not easy to predict the exact transportation cost of a route for a certain time period. Generally possible values of parameters are given by the experts in approximate intervals, linguistic terms, etc. For instance, unit transportation cost for a route is “about 5”, the supply of a source is “around 35–38”, etc. Also each of the point in a given interval may not have the same importance or possibility. For a large data set of a certain parameter collected from previous experiments, generally all the points are not equally possible. Such types of linguistic information, approximate intervals and non-equipossible data set can be expressed by fuzzy numbers(/variables), specially by triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers [3,4,10,21,42]. However, due to different types of complexities, noises, large volume, multiple sources of the available data, it is not always possible to determine exact membership grade of each point to represent an imprecise parameter by an ordinary (type-1) fuzzy set (/numbers). Type-2 fuzzy sets (T2 FSs) are used to convey the uncertainty (fuzziness) in the membership function of type-1 fuzzy sets. Human judgements are not always precise and also a word does not have the same meaning to different people. Mendel [30,31] explained that a sensible way to model a word is to using T2 FS, more precisely interval T2 FS. Also the three dimensional nature of a T2 FS gives an extra degree of freedom to represent uncertainty over the ordinary fuzzy set.Type-2 fuzzy set (T2 FS) was first introduced by Zadeh [50]. Later a significant number of research works on the theoretical development of T2 FSs have been reported by many researchers (Mizumoto and Tanaka [37], Mendel and John [32,33], Karnik and Mendel [18], Coupland and John [9], Castillo et al. [5]). Recently type-2 fuzzy sets received much attention and used in various fields such as neural network (Aliev et al. [1]), group decision making system (Chen et al. [6], Chen and Wang [7], Chen [8]), portfolio selection problem (Hasuike and Ishi [14]), pattern recognition (Mitchell [36]), data envelopment analysis (Quin et al. [41]), etc. But the visualization as well as computational complexity is very high to deal with T2 FS due to fuzziness in membership function of T2 FS. To reduce complexity, generally a T2 FS is converted to a type-1 fuzzy set (T1 FS) by some type reduction methods. However because of computational complexity, the most of the available reduction methods in the literature are for interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2 FS) which is a special case of general T2 FS and less complicated. Karnik and Mendel [18] defined centroid of an IT2 FS and they proposed a centroid type-reduction method to reduce IT2 FS into T1 FS. But it is very difficult to apply this centroid type reduction method to general T2 FS. Because this method was derived from embedded sets representation theory in which a T2 FS is represented as the union of its T2 embedded sets and this union consists of an astronomical number of T2 embedded sets, which results a very high computational complexity. Liu [26], Wu and Tan [47] developed centroid type reduction strategies for general type-2 fuzzy logic system. Coupland and John [9] proposed a geometric defuzzification method for type-2 fuzzy sets by transforming a type-2 fuzzy set into a geometric type-2 fuzzy set. In terms of possibility theory, Liu and Liu [27] defined a type-2 fuzzy variable (T2 FV) as a map from a fuzzy possibility space to the set of real numbers. Qin et al. [41] introduced three kinds of reduction methods called optimistic CV, pessimistic CV and CV reduction methods for type-2 fuzzy variables (T2 FVs) based on CVs (critical values) of regular fuzzy variables.The solid transportation problem (STP) [15,17,21,39,48] is a problem of transporting goods from some sources to some destinations through some conveyances (modes of transportation) so that the objective (total transportation cost, time, profit, etc.) is optimum. In transportation system, it is sometime required to transport more than one item from some sources to some destinations through some conveyances. Then this problem is called multi-item STP. But in this case often a situation arises when not all types of items can be transported through all types of conveyances due to nature of the items (e.g., liquid, solid, breakable, etc.). Transportation problem (TP) with fuzzy (type-1) parameters (Ammar and Youness [2], Jiménez and Verdegay [17], Ida et al. [16], Kaur and Kumar [19], Peidro and Vasant [40], Kundu et al. [20,21], Ojha et al. [39], Yang and Liu [48]) are discussed by many researchers. However there are very few research works have been done on TP with type-2 fuzzy parameters. Figueroa-García and Hernández [11] first considered a transportation problem with interval type-2 fuzzy demands and supplies and Kundu et al. [22] first modelled and solved transportation problem with parameters as general type-2 fuzzy variables. In this paper, we have introduced nearest interval approximation method of continuous T2 FV so that decision making problem with type-2 fuzzy parameters can be solved easily. The contribution of this paper can be stated as follows:•A nearest interval approximation method for continuous general T2 FS is developed.A multi-item STP with restriction on conveyances is formulated considering the situation that some specific items can not be transported through some particular conveyances.Two different methods – the first one chance-constrained programming using generalized credibility measure and the second one using interval approximations of continuous T2 FV are used to solve the MISTP with parameters represented by T2 FVs.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses some concepts of possibility space, fuzzy variable and type-2 fuzzy set theory. Section 3 outlines CV-based reduction methods and centroid type reduction method for general type-2 fuzzy sets. In Section 4, we develop a nearest interval approximation method for continuous T2 FV with the help of CV-based reduction method. The method is illustrated with type-2 triangular fuzzy variable. In Section 5, we formulate a multi-item solid transportation problem with restriction on some items and conveyances in the sense that some specific items are prohibited to be transported through some particular conveyances. In this problem the transportation parameters, e.g., unit transportation costs, supplies, demands, conveyance capacities are type-2 triangular fuzzy variables. In Section 6, we discuss three solution procedures to solve the said problem, first one by formulating chance-constrained programming model using the CV-based reductions, the second using nearest interval approximations and the third using centroid defuzzified values of the type-2 fuzzy parameters. Section 7 numerically illustrate the problem and methods. Discussion and conclusion are provided in Sections 8 and 9 respectively.Zadeh [49] introduced the possibility theory to interpret degree of uncertainty of members of a fuzzy set. The membershipμA˜(x)of an element x in a fuzzy setA˜is then termed as degree of possibility that the element belongs to the set.A triplet (Θ, p, Pos) is called a possibility space, where Θ is non-empty set of points, p is power set of Θ and Pos:Θ↦[0, 1] is a mapping, called possibility measure (Wang [45]) defined as(i)Pos(∅)=0 and Pos(Θ)=1.For any {Ai|i∈I}⊂Θ,Pos(∪Ai)=supiPos(Ai).A fuzzy variable (Nahmias [38]) is defined as a function from the possibility space (Θ, p, Pos) to the set of real numbersRto describe fuzzy phenomena, where possibility measure (Pos) of a fuzzy event{ξ˜∈B},B⊂Ris defined asPos{ξ˜∈B}=supx∈Bμξ˜(x),μξ˜(x)is referred to as possibility distribution ofξ˜.For normalized fuzzy variable (supx∈Rμξ˜(x)=1), necessity measure (Nec) is defined asNec{ξ˜∈B}=1−Pos{ξ˜∈Bc}=1−supx∈Bcμξ˜(x)and the credibility measure (Liu and Liu [25]) of{ξ˜∈B}is defined asCr{ξ˜∈B}=1/2(Pos{ξ˜∈B}+Nec{ξ˜∈B}).Now if the fuzzy variable is not normalized, then this usual credibility measure can not be used. Thats why for a general fuzzy variable, generalized credibility measure is used. The generalized credibility measureCr˜of a fuzzy event{ξ˜∈B},B⊂Ris defined asCr˜{ξ˜∈B}=12(supx∈Rμξ˜(x)+supx∈Bμξ˜(x)−supx∈Bcμξ˜(x)).It is obvious that ifξ˜is normalized, thenCr˜coincides with usual credibility measure Cr.For a possibility space (Θ, p, Pos), a regular fuzzy variable (Liu and Liu [27])ξ˜is defined as a measurable map from Θ to [0, 1] in the sense that for every t∈[0, 1], one has{γ∈Θ|μξ˜(γ)≤t}∈p.A discrete RFV is represented asξ˜∼r1r2...rnμ1μ2...μn,where ri∈[0, 1] and μi>0, ∀i and maxi{μi}=1.A type-2 fuzzy setA˜in X is a fuzzy set in which the membership function is also fuzzy, i.e. membership grade for each element is no longer a crisp value but a fuzzy set. This membership function is called type-2 membership function. A T2 FSA˜is defined (Mendel and John [32]) asA˜={((x,u),μA˜(x,u)):∀x∈X,∀u∈Jx⊆[0,1]},where0≤μA˜(x,u)≤1is the type-2 membership function, Jxis the primary membership of x∈X which is the domain of the secondary membership functionμ˜A˜(x)(defined below).A˜is also be expressed asA˜=∫x∈X∫u∈JxμA˜(x,u)/(x,u),Jx⊆[0,1],where ∫∫ denotes union over all admissible x and u. For discrete universes of discourse ∫ is replaced by ∑.For each values of x, say x=x′, the secondary membership function (Mendel and John [28]), denoted byμA˜(x=x′,u),u∈Jx′⊆[0,1]is defined asμA˜(x′,u)≡μ˜A˜(x′)=∫u∈Jx′fx′(u)/u,where0≤fx′(u)≤1. For a particularu=u′∈Jx′,fx′(u′)=μA˜(x′,u′)is called secondary membership grade. SoA˜can be written asA˜={(x,μ˜A˜(x)):x∈X}orA˜=∫x∈Xμ˜A˜(x)/x=∫x∈X[∫u∈Jxfx(u)/u]/x.Now if all the secondary membership grades are 1 (i.e. fx(u)=1, ∀x, u) then this T2 FS is called interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2 FS) (Mendel et al. [34]). A IT2 FS is characterized by the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) which represents a two-dimensional plane consists of the points x and their primary memberships Jx. In other words FOU convey the uncertainty in the primary memberships of an IT2 FS.As a fuzzy variable (type-1) is defined as a function from the possibility space to the set of real numbers, a type-2 fuzzy variable is defined as a function from the fuzzy possibility space to the set of real numbers. If(Θ,p,Pos˜)is a fuzzy possibility space (Liu and Liu [27]), then a type-2 fuzzy variableξ˜is defined as a map from Θ toRsuch that for anyt∈Rthe set{γ∈Θ|ξ˜(γ)≤t}∈p, i.e. a type-2 fuzzy variable (T2 FV) is a map from a fuzzy possibility space to the set of real numbers.Thenμ˜ξ˜(x), called secondary possibility distribution function ofξ˜, is defined (Liu and Liu [27]) as a mapR↦R[0,1]such thatμ˜ξ˜(x)=Pos˜{γ∈Θ|ξ˜(γ)=x},x∈R.μξ˜(x,u), called type-2 possibility distribution function, is a mapR×Jx↦[0,1], defined asμξ˜(x,u)=Pos{μ˜ξ˜(x)=u},(x,u)∈R×Jx, Jx⊆[0, 1] is the domain or support ofμ˜ξ˜(x), i.e.,Jx={u∈[0,1]|μξ˜(x,u)>0}. Here Jxmay be called as primary possibility of the point x and for a particular value of x, say x=x′,μ˜ξ˜(x′)=μξ˜(x′,u)gives the secondary possibilities∀u∈Jx′.Example 1Let X={4, 5, 6} and the primary memberships of the points of X are J4={0.3, 0.4, 0.6}, J5={0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, J6={0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8} respectively. The secondary membership function of the point 4 isμ˜A˜(4)=μA˜(4,u)=(0.6/0.3)+(1.0/0.4)+(0.7/0.6)∼0.30.40.60.61.00.7,i.e.,μA˜(4,0.3)=0.6,μA˜(4,0.4)=1andμA˜(4,0.6)=0.7. HereμA˜(4,0.3)=0.6means membership (secondary) grade that the point 4 has the membership (primary) 0.3 is 0.6. SoA˜takes on the value 4 with membership0.30.40.60.61.00.7, which represents a RFV.Similarlyμ˜A˜(5)=μA˜(5,u)=(0.7/0.6)+(1.0/0.8)+(0.8/0.9),μ˜A˜(6)=μA˜(6,u)=(0.3/0.5)+(0.4/0.6)+(1.0/0.7)+(0.5/0.8).So discrete type-2 fuzzy variableA˜is given byA˜=(0.6/0.3)/4+(1.0/0.4)/4+(0.7/0.6)/4+(0.7/0.6)/5+(1/0.8)/5+(0.8/0.9)/5+(0.3/0.5)/6+(0.4/0.6)/6+(1.0/0.7)/6+(0.5/0.8)/6.A˜is depicted in Fig. 1.Example 2(Type-2 triangular fuzzy variable)A type-2 triangular fuzzy variableξ˜is represented by (r1, r2, r3;θl, θr), where r1, r2, r3 are real numbers and θl, θr∈[0, 1] are two parameters characterizing the degree of uncertainty thatξ˜takes a value x and the secondary possibility distribution functionμ˜ξ˜(x)ofξ˜is defined by(1)μ˜ξ˜(x)=x−r1r2−r1−θlminx−r1r2−r1,r2−xr2−r1,x−r1r2−r1,x−r1r2−r1+θrminx−r1r2−r1,r2−xr2−r1for any x∈[r1, r2], and(2)μ˜ξ˜(x)=r3−xr3−r2−θlminr3−xr3−r2,x−r2r3−r2,r3−xr3−r2,r3−xr3−r2+θrminr3−xr3−r2,x−r2r3−r2for any x∈(r2, r3].A type-2 triangular fuzzy variable can be seen as an extension of a type-1 triangular fuzzy variable or simply a triangular fuzzy variable [24]. In a triangular fuzzy variable (TFV) (r1, r2, r3), the membership grade (possibility degree) of each point is a fixed number in [0,1]. However in a type-2 triangular fuzzy variableξ˜=(r1,r2,r3;θl,θr), the primary memberships (possibilities) of the points are no longer fixed values, instead they have a range between 0 and 1. Here θland θrare used to represent the spreads of primary memberships of type-2 TFV. Obviously if θl=θr=0, then type-2 TFVξ˜becomes a type-1 TFV and Eqs. (1) and (2) together become the membership function of a type-1 TFV. Now from Eqs. (1) and (2),μ˜ξ˜(x)can be written asμ˜ξ˜(x)=x−r1r2−r1−θlx−r1r2−r1,x−r1r2−r1,x−r1r2−r1+θrx−r1r2−r1,ifx∈r1,r1+r22;x−r1r2−r1−θlr2−xr2−r1,x−r1r2−r1,x−r1r2−r1+θrr2−xr2−r1,ifx∈r1+r22,r2;r3−xr3−r2−θlx−r2r3−r2,r3−xr3−r2,r3−xr3−r2+θrx−r2r3−r2,ifx∈r2,r2+r32;r3−xr3−r2−θlr3−xr3−r2,r3−xr3−r2,r3−xr3−r2+θrr3−xr3−r2,ifx∈r2+r32,r3.This type-2 triangular fuzzy variableξ˜is denoted by (r1, r2, r3;θl, θr).For example consider the type-2 triangular fuzzy variableξ˜=(2,3,4;0.5,0.8).Then its secondary possibility distribution is given byμ˜ξ˜(x)=(0.5(x−2),x−2,1.8(x−2)),ifx∈[2,2.5];((x−2)−0.5(3−x),x−2,(x−2)+0.8(3−x)),ifx∈(2.5,3];((4−x)−0.5(x−3),4−x,(4−x)+0.8(x−3)),ifx∈(3,3.5];(0.5(4−x),4−x,1.8(4−x)),ifx∈(3.5,4].So membership grade for each values of x is a triangular fuzzy variable (more precisely a triangular RFV), e.g.μ˜ξ˜(2.5)=(0.25,0.5,0.9),μ˜ξ˜(3.2)=(0.7,0.8,0.96), etc. So the domain of secondary possibilityμ˜ξ˜(2.5), i.e., J2.5 ranges from 0.25 to 0.9 and that ofμ˜ξ˜(3.2)ranges from 0.7 to 0.96, etc. The domains of secondary possibilities of all the points construct the FOU. The FOU ofξ˜is depicted in Fig. 2.Qin et al. [41] introduced three kinds of critical values (CV) of a RFVξ˜. These are(i)the optimistic CV ofξ˜, denoted by CV*[ξ˜], is defined as(3)CV*[ξ˜]=supα∈[0,1][α∧Pos{ξ˜≥α}]the pessimistic CV ofξ˜, denoted by CV*[ξ˜], is defined as(4)CV*[ξ˜]=supα∈[0,1][α∧Nec{ξ˜≥α}]the CV ofξ˜, denoted by CV[ξ˜], is defined as(5)CV[ξ˜]=supα∈[0,1][α∧Cr{ξ˜≥α}].Qin et al. [41] proposed a CV-based reduction method which reduces a type-2 fuzzy variable to a type-1 fuzzy variable (may or may not be normal). Letξ˜be a type-2 fuzzy variable with secondary membership functionμ˜ξ˜(x)(which is a RFV). The method is to introduce the CVs as a representing value for RFVμ˜ξ˜(x), i.e. CV*[μ˜ξ˜(x)], CV*[μ˜ξ˜(x)] or CV[μ˜ξ˜(x)]. Then these methods are respectively called optimistic CV reduction, pessimistic CV reduction and CV reduction method.Example 1 (continued) Consider the type-2 fuzzy variableA˜(Example 1 in Section 2.3). From definition (i), Section 2.4, we have we haveCV*[μ˜A˜(4)]=supα∈[0,1][α∧Pos{μ˜A˜(4)≥α}], wherePos{μ˜A˜(4)≥α}=1,ifα≤0.4;0.7,if0.4<α≤0.6;0,if0.6<α≤1.so thatCV*[μ˜A˜(4)]=supα∈[0,0.4][α∧1]∨supα∈(0.4,0.6][α∧0.7]∨supα∈(0.6,1][α∧0]=0.4∨0.6∨0=0.6Similarly from definitions (i), (ii) and (iii) in Section 2.4 we haveCV*[μ˜A˜(4)]=0.6,CV*[μ˜A˜(5)]=0.8,CV*[μ˜A˜(6)]=0.6.CV*[μ˜A˜(4)]=0.4,CV*[μ˜A˜(5)]=0.6,CV*[μ˜A˜(6)]=0.6.CV[μ˜A˜(4)]=0.4,CV[μ˜A˜(5)]=0.65,CV[μ˜A˜(6)]=0.6.Then applying optimistic CV, pessimistic CV and CV reduction methods, the type-2 fuzzy variableA˜reduced respectively to the following type-1 fuzzy variables4560.60.80.6,4560.40.60.6and4560.40.650.6Theorem 1(Qin et al.[41]).Letξ˜be a type-2 triangular fuzzy variable defined asξ˜=(r1,r2,r3;θl,θr). Then we have:(i)Using the optimistic CV reduction method, the reduction ξ1ofξ˜has the following possibility distribution(6)μξ1(x)=(1+θr)(x−r1)r2−r1+θr(x−r1),ifx∈r1,r1+r22;(1−θr)x+θrr2−r1r2−r1+θr(r2−x),ifx∈r1+r22,r2;(−1+θr)x−θrr2+r3r3−r2+θr(x−r2),ifx∈r2,r2+r32;(1+θr)(r3−x)r3−r2+θr(r3−x),ifx∈r2+r32,r3.Using the pessimistic CV reduction method, the reduction ξ2ofξ˜has the following possibility distribution(7)μξ2(x)=x−r1r2−r1+θl(x−r1),ifx∈r1,r1+r22;x−r1r2−r1+θl(r2−x),ifx∈r1+r22,r2;r3−xr3−r2+θl(x−r2),ifx∈r2,r2+r32;r3−xr3−r2+θl(r3−x),ifx∈r2+r32,r3.Using the CV reduction method, the reduction ξ3ofξ˜has the following possibility distribution(8)μξ3(x)=(1+θr)(x−r1)r2−r1+2θr(x−r1),ifx∈r1,r1+r22;(1−θl)x+θlr2−r1r2−r1+2θl(r2−x),ifx∈r1+r22,r2;(−1+θl)x−θlr2+r3r3−r2+2θl(x−r2),ifx∈r2,r2+r32;(1+θr)(r3−x)r3−r2+2θr(r3−x),ifx∈r2+r32,r3.Example 4Consider the type-2 triangular fuzzy variableξ˜=(2,3,4;0.5,0.8)whose FOU is depicted in Fig. 2. Then its optimistic CV, pessimistic CV and CV reductions are shown in Fig. 3.Reduction of general T2 FS by centroid type reduction method (Liu [26]): Centroid type-reduction method (Karnik and Mendel [18]) is one of the most popular and widely used type-reduction method. However, this method is applicable for interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Liu [26] developed a strategy to implement centroid type-reduction for general type-2 fuzzy logic systems. In this method, continuous domain of general T2 FS is discretized into finite number of points and α∈[0, 1] is divided into Δ+1 values, which are 0, 1/Δ, 2/Δ,...,(Δ−1)/Δ, 1. Then T2 FS is decomposed into multiple α-planes based on α-plane representation. Then for each α-plane, the KM algorithm is used individually to compute the lower and upper bound for the centroid(which is an interval). Finally all intervals for all α-planes are unioned into the type reduced type-1 fuzzy set. We apply this method for the above T2 triangular fuzzy variableξ˜(Ex. 3). For this purpose we discretized the continuous domain into finite number of points {xi}, such that xi+1−xi=0.05 and break α∈[0, 1] into 50 values. Then applying this method, we derived the centroid type-reduced set as shown in Fig. 4.Here it is observed that (from Fig. 3) the domain of the reduced T1 FS obtained by CV reduction method remains the same as original T2 FS, i.e. this reduction at least does not effect the domain of the original set.From the Example-1 (continued) of this section it is observed that type-1 fuzzy variables obtained by CV-based reduction methods are not always normalized, i.e. are general fuzzy variables. For such cases generalized credibility measureCr˜is used instead of the credibility measure. Using generalized credibility measure for a reduced fuzzy variable from a type-2 triangular fuzzy variable by CV reduction method, the following theorem is established.Theorem 2(Qin et al.[41]) Let ξibe the reduction of the type-2 fuzzy variableξi˜=(r1i,r2i,r3i;θl,i,θr,i)obtained by the CV reduction method for i=1, 2, ..., n. Suppose ξ1, ξ2, ..., ξnare mutually independent, and ki≥0 for i=1, 2, ..., n.(i)Given the generalized credibility level α∈(0, 0.5], if α∈(0, 0.25], thenCr˜{∑i=1nkiξi≤t}≥αis equivalent to∑i=1n(1−2α+(1−4α)θr,i)kir1i+2αkir2i1+(1−4α)θr,i≤t,and if α∈(0.25, 0.5], thenCr˜{∑i=1nkiξi≤t}≥αis equivalent to∑i=1n(1−2α)kir1i+(2α+(4α−1)θl,i)kir2i1+(4α−1)θl,i≤t.Given the generalized credibility level α∈(0.5, 1], if α∈(0.5, 0.75], thenCr˜{∑i=1nkiξi≤t}≥αis equivalent to∑i=1n(2α−1)kir3i+(2(1−α)+(3−4α)θl,i)kir2i1+(3−4α)θl,i≤t,and if α∈(0.75, 1], thenCr˜{∑i=1nkiξi≤t}≥αis equivalent to∑i=1n(2α−1+(4α−3)θr,i)kir3i+2(1−α)kir2i1+(4α−3)θr,i≤t.Corollary: From the above theorem the equivalent expressions ofCr˜{∑i=1nkiξi≥t}≥αare easily obtained, sinceCr˜∑i=1nkiξi≥t≥α⇒Cr˜∑i=1n−kiξi≤−t≥α⇒Cr˜∑i=1nkiξi′≤t′≥α,whereξi′=−ξiis the CV reduction of−ξi˜=(−r3i,−r2i,−r1i;θr,i,θl,i)and t′=−t.So from (i) of the above theorem, given the generalized credibility level α∈(0, 0.5], if α∈(0, 0.25], thenCr˜{∑i=1nkiξi≥t}≥α, i.e.Cr˜{∑i=1nkiξi′≤t′}≥αis equivalent to∑i=1n(1−2α+(1−4α)θl,i)ki(−r3i)+2αki(−r2i)1+(1−4α)θl,i≤t′=−t,which implies∑i=1n(1−2α+(1−4α)θl,i)kir3i+2αkir2i1+(1−4α)θl,i≥t,and if α∈(0.25, 0.5], thenCr˜{∑i=1nkiξi≥t}≥αis equivalent to∑i=1n(1−2α)ki(−r3i)+(2α+(4α−1)θr,i)ki(−r2i)1+(4α−1)θr,i≤−twhich implies∑i=1n(1−2α)kir3i+(2α+(4α−1)θr,i)kir2i1+(4α−1)θr,i≥t.The equivalent expressions for other values of α are similarly obtained.Here we propose a method of approximation of continuous type-2 fuzzy variable by crisp interval. For this purpose we first find the CV-based reductions of the type-2 fuzzy variable. Then we derive the corresponding α-cuts of these CV-based reductions. Finally applying interval approximation method to the α-cuts we find approximate crisp intervals. The entire method is shown in Fig. 5.Now we illustrate the above method with type-2 triangular fuzzy variable. Letξ˜be a type-2 triangular fuzzy variable defined asξ˜=(r1,r2,r3;θl,θr). Then from Theorem 1 we have the optimistic CV reduction, pessimistic CV reduction and CV reduction ofξ˜as ξ1, ξ2 and ξ3 respectively with the possibility distributions given by Eqs. (6)–(8). Now using the definition of α-cut of a fuzzy variable (Wu [46]) we find α-cuts of the reductions ofξ˜.α-cut of the optimistic CV reductionξ1ofξ˜: Applying the definition of α-cut of a fuzzy variable we find the α-cut of the reduction ξ1 as [ξ1L(α), ξ1R(α)], where,(9)ξ1L(α)=(1+θr)r1+(r2−r1−θrr1)α(1+θr)−θrα,0≤α≤0.5;(r1−θrr2)+(r2−r1+θrr2)α(1−θr)+θrα,0.5<α≤1.(10)ξ1R(α)=(r3−θrr2)−(r3−r2−θrr2)α(1−θr)+θrα,0.5≤α≤1;(1+θr)r3−(r3−r2+θrr3)α(1+θr)−θrα,0≤α<0.5.α-cut of the pessimistic CV reductionξ2ofξ˜:α-cut of the reduction ξ2 is obtained as [ξ2L(α), ξ2R(α)], where,(11)ξ2L(α)=r1+(r2−r1−θlr1)α1−θlα,0≤α≤0.5;r1+(r2−r1+θlr2)α1+θlα,0.5<α≤1.(12)ξ2R(α)=r3−(r3−r2−θlr2)α1+θlα,0.5≤α<1;r3−(r3−r2+θlr3)α1−θlα,0≤α<0.5.α-cut of the CV reductionξ3ofξ˜:α-cut of the reduction ξ3 is given by [ξ3L(α), ξ3R(α)], where,(13)ξ3L(α)=(1+θr)r1+(r2−r1−2θrr1)α(1+θr)−2θrα,0≤α≤0.5;(r1−θlr2)+(r2−r1+2θlr2)α(1−θl)+2θlα,0.5<α≤1.(14)ξ3R(α)=(r3−θlr2)−(r3−r2−2θlr2)α(1−θl)+2θlα,0.5≤α≤1;(1+θr)r3−(r3−r2+2θrr3)α(1+θr)−2θrα,0≤α<0.5.Now we know that nearest interval approximation of a fuzzy number (Grzegorzewski [13])A˜with distance metric d is given byCd(A˜)=[CL,CR], whereCL=∫01AL(α)dαandCR=∫01AR(α)dα, where distance metric d to measure distance ofA˜fromCd(A˜)is given byd(A˜,Cd(A˜)=∫01{AL(α)−CL}2dα+∫01{AR(α)−CR}2dαUsing this method for the α-cuts of optimistic CV, pessimistic CV or CV reduction ofξ˜we can find the nearest interval approximation ofξ˜.Nearest interval approximation ofξ˜usingα-cut of the optimistic CV reductionξ1ofξ˜: In this case the nearest interval approximation ofξ˜is obtained as [CL, CR] where,(15)CL=∫01ξ1L(α)dα=∫00.5(1+θr)r1+(r2−r1−θrr1)α(1+θr)−θrαdα+∫0.51(r1−θrr2)+(r2−r1+θrr2)α(1−θr)+θrαdα=CL1+CL2,CL1=(1+θr)r1θrln1+θr1+0.5θr−r2−r1−θrr1θr20.5θr−(1+θr)ln1+θr1+0.5θr,CL2=−r1−θrr2θrln(1−0.5θr)+r2−r1+θrr2θr2[0.5θr+(1−θr)ln(1−0.5θr)].(16)CR=∫01ξ1R(α)dα=∫00.5(1+θr)r3−(r3−r2+θrr3)α(1+θr)−θrαdα+∫0.51(r3−θrr2)−(r3−r2−θrr2)α(1−θr)+θrαdα=CR1+CR2,CR1=(1+θr)r3θrln1+θr1+0.5θr+r3−r2+θrr3θr20.5θr−(1+θr)ln1+θr1+0.5θr,CR2=−r3−θrr2θrln(1−0.5θr)−r3−r2−θrr2θr2[0.5θr+(1−θr)ln(1−0.5θr)].We call this interval as optimistic interval approximation ofξ˜.Nearest interval approximation ofξ˜usingα-cut of the pessimistic CV reductionξ2ofξ˜: In this case the nearest interval approximation ofξ˜is obtained as [CL, CR] where,(17)CL=∫01ξ2L(α)dα=∫00.5r1+(r2−r1−θlr1)α1−θlαdα+∫0.51r1+(r2−r1+θlr2)α1+θlαdα=CL1+CL2,CL1=−r1θlln(1−0.5θl)−r2−r1−θlr1θl2[0.5θl+ln(1−0.5θl)],CL2=r1θlln1+θl1+0.5θl+r2−r1+θlr2θl20.5θl−ln1+θl1+0.5θl.(18)CR=∫01ξ2R(α)dα=∫00.5r3−(r3−r2+θlr3)α1−θlαdα+∫0.51r3−(r3−r2−θlr2)α1+θlαdα=CR1+CR2,CR1=−r3θlln(1−0.5θl)+r3−r2+θlr3θl2[0.5θl+ln(1−0.5θl)],CR2=r3θlln1+θl1+0.5θl−r3−(r3−r2−θlr2θl20.5θl−ln1+θl1+0.5θl.We call this interval as pessimistic interval approximation ofξ˜.Nearest interval approximation ofξ˜usingα-cut of the CV reductionξ3ofξ˜: In this case the nearest interval approximation ofξ˜is obtained as [CL, CR] where,(19)CL=∫01ξ3L(α)dα=∫00.5(1+θr)r1+(r2−r1−2θrr1)α(1+θr)−2θrαdα+∫0.51(r1−θlr2)+(r2−r1+2θlr2)α(1−θl)+2θlα=CL1+CL2,CL1=(1+θr)r12θrln(1+θr)−r2−r1−2θrr14θr2[θr−(1+θr)ln(1+θr)],CL2=r1−θlr22θlln(1+θl)+r2−r1+2θlr24θl2[θl−(1−θl)ln(1+θl)].(20)CR=∫01ξ3R(α)dα=∫00.5(1+θr)r3−(r3−r2+2θrr3)α(1+θr)−2θrαdα+∫00.5(r3−θlr2)−(r3−r2−2θlr2)α(1−θl)+2θlαdα=CR1+CR2,CR1=(1+θr)r32θrln(1+θr)+r3−r2+2θrr34θr2[θr−(1+θr)ln(1+θr)],CR2=r3−θlr22θlln(1+θl)−r3−r2−2θlr24θl2[θl−(1−θl)ln(1+θl)].We call this interval as credibilistic interval approximation ofξ˜.Example 3 (continued): Consider the type-2 triangular fuzzy variableξ˜=(2,3,4;0.5,0.8), we find nearest interval approximation ofξ˜. From Eqs. (15) and (16) the optimistic, Eqs. (17) and (18) the pessimistic and Eqs. (19) and (20) the credibilistic interval approximations ofξ˜are obtained as[2.4086,3.5913],[2.5567,3.4432]and[2.4925,3.5074]respectively. These results are shown in the Fig. 6.Let l items are to be transported from m origins (or sources) Oi(i=1, 2, ..., m) to n destinations Dj(j=1, 2, ..., n) by means of K different modes of transportation (conveyance). Also there are some restrictions on some specific items and conveyances such a way that some items can not be transported through some conveyances. Let us denote Ikas the set of items which can be transported through conveyance k (k=1, 2, ..., K). We use notation p(=1, 2, ..., l) to denote the items. Then the mathematical formulation of the problem is as follows:(21)MinZ=∑p∈I1∑i=1m∑j=1ncij1p˜xij1p+∑p∈I2∑i=1m∑j=1ncij2p˜xij2p+...+∑p∈IK∑i=1m∑j=1ncijKp˜xijKp,where|I1⋃I2⋃...⋃IK|=l=∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp.(cijkp˜xijkp),subjectto∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≤aip˜,i=1,2,...,m;p=1,2,...l,∑i=1m∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≥bjp˜,j=1,2,...,n;p=1,2,...,l,∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1ndijkpxijkp≤e˜k,k=1,2,...,K,xijkp≥0,∀i,j,k,pwheredijkpis defined asdijkp=1,ifp∈Ik;0,otherwise.∀i, j, k, p.Here,xijkpis the decision variable representing the amount of p-th item transported from source i to destination j. The unit transportation costcijkp˜(from i-th origin to j-th destination by k-th conveyance for p-th item), total supply of p-th itemaip˜at i-th origin, total demand of p-th itembjp˜at j-th destination and total capacitye˜kof k-th conveyance are all type-2 fuzzy variables.Suppose thatcijkp′˜,aip′˜,bjp′˜ande′˜kare the reduced fuzzy (type-1) variables from type-2 fuzzy variablescijkp˜,aip˜,bjp˜ande˜krespectively based on CV-based reduction method. Now to solve the above problem we formulate a chance-constrained programming model with these reduced fuzzy parameters. In chance-constraint programming, the uncertain constraints are allowed to be violated such that constraints must be satisfied at some chance (/confidence) level. Chance-constrained programming with fuzzy (type-1) parameters was developed by Liu and Iwamura [28], Yang and Liu [48], Kundu et al. [21] using credibility measure. But since the reduced fuzzy parameterscijkp′˜,aip′˜,bjp′˜ande′˜kmay not be normalized, so usual credibility measure can not be used. So using generalized credibility, as the problem is minimization problem, the following chance-constrained programming model is formulated for the above problem (21).Minx(Minf¯f¯)Cr˜∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp.(cijkp′˜xijkp)≤f¯≥α,(22)subjecttoCr˜{∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≤aip′˜}≥αip,i=1,2,...,m;p=1,2,...l,Cr˜{∑i=1m∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≥bjp′˜}≥βjp,j=1,2,...,n;p=1,2,...,l,Cr˜{∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1ndijkpxijkp≤e′˜k}≥γk,k=1,2,...,K,xijkp≥0,dijkp=1,ifp∈Ik;0,otherwise.∀i,j,k,pwhere Minf¯indicates the minimum possible crisp form that the objective function achieves with generalized credibility at least α (0<α≤1). In other words, α indicates that we are going to minimize the α-critical value [21,48] of the objective function.αip,βjpand γk(0<αip,βjp,γk≤1)are predetermined generalized credibility levels of satisfaction of the respective constraints for all i, j, k, p. The first constraint indicates that total amount of p-th item transported from source i must be less than or equal to its supply capacity at the credibility level at leastαip; the second constraint indicates that total amount transported to destination j must satisfy its requirement at the credibility at leastβjpand the third constraint indicates that total amount transported through conveyance k must not be more than its capacity at the credibility at least γk.We considercijkp˜,aip˜,bjp˜ande˜kare all mutually independent type-2 triangular fuzzy variables defined bycijkp˜=(cijkp1,cijkp2,cijkp3;θl,ijkp,θr,ijkp),aip˜=(aip1,aip2,aip3;θl,ip,θr,ip),bjp˜=(bjp1,bjp2,bjp3;θl,jp,θr,jp)ande˜k=(ek1,ek2,ek3;θl,k,θr,k). Then from Theorem-2 and its corollary, the chance-constrained model formulation (22) is turned into the following crisp equivalent parametric programming problems: Case-I: 0<α≤0.25: The equivalent parametric programming problem for model (22) is(23)Min∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp(1−2α+(1−4α)θr,ijkp)cijkp1xijkp+2αcijkp2xijkp1+(1−4α)θr,ijkp,subjectto∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≤Faip,i=1,2,...,m;p=1,2,...l,∑i=1m∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≥Fbjp,j=1,2,...,n;p=1,2,...l,∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1ndijkpxijkp≤Fek,k=1,2,...,K,xijkp≥0,dijkp=1,ifp∈Ik;0,otherwise.∀i,j,k,p,whereFaip,FbjpandFekare given by (27)–(29), respectively.Case-II: 0.25<α≤0.5: Then the equivalent parametric programming problem for model (22) is(24)Min∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp(1−2α)cijkp1xijkp+(2α+(4α−1)θl,ijkp)cijkp2xijkp1+(4α−1)θl,ijkpsubjectto∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≤Faip,i=1,2,...,m;p=1,2,...l,∑i=1m∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≥Fbjp,j=1,2,...,n;p=1,2,...l,∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1ndijkpxijkp≤Fek,k=1,2,...,K,xijkp≥0,dijkp=1,ifp∈Ik;0,otherwise.∀i,j,k,p.Case-III: 0.5<α≤0.75: Then the equivalent parametric programming problem for model (22) is(25)Min∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp(2α−1)cijkp3xijkp+(2(1−α)+(3−4α)θl,ijkp)cijkp2xijkp1+(3−4α)θl,ijkpsubjectto∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≤Faip,i=1,2,...,m;p=1,2,...l,∑i=1m∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≥Fbjp,j=1,2,...,n;p=1,2,...l,∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1ndijkpxijkp≤Fek,k=1,2,...,K,xijkp≥0,dijkp=1,ifp∈Ik;0,otherwise.∀i,j,k,p.Case-IV: 0.75<α≤1: Then the equivalent parametric programming problem for model (22) is(26)Min∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp(2α−1+(4α−3)θr,ijkp)cijkp3xijkp+2(1−α)cijkp2xijkp1+(4α−3)θr,ijkpsubjectto∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≤Faip,i=1,2,...,m;p=1,2,...l,∑i=1m∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≥Fbjp,j=1,2,...,n;p=1,2,...l,∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1ndijkpxijkp≤Fek,k=1,2,...,K,xijkp≥0,dijkp=1,ifp∈Ik;0,otherwise.∀i,j,k,pWhere,(27)Faip=(1−2αip+(1−4αip)θl,ip)aip3+2αipaip21+(1−4αip)θl,ip,if0<αip≤0.25;(1−2αip)aip3+(2αip+(4αip−1)θr,ip)aip21+(4αip−1)θr,ip,if0.25<αip≤0.5;(2αip−1)aip1+(2(1−αip)+(3−4αip)θr,ip)aip21+(3−4αip)θr,ip,if0.5<αip≤0.75;(2αip−1+(4αip−3)θl,ip)aip1+2(1−αip)aip21+(4αip−3)θl,ip,if0.75<αip≤1.(28)Fbjp=(1−2βjp+(1−4βjp)θr,jp)bjp1+2βjpbjp21+(1−4βjp)βr,jp,if0<βjp≤0.25;(1−2βjp)bjp1+(2βjp+(4βjp−1)θl,jp)bjp21+(4βjp−1)θl,jp,if0.25<βjp≤0.5;(2βjp−1)bjp3+(2(1−βjp)+(3−4βjp)θl,jp)bjp21+(3−4βjp)θl,jp,if0.5<βjp≤0.75;(2βjp−1+(4βjp−3)θr,jp)bjp3+2(1−βjp)bjp21+(4βjp−3)θr,jp,if0.75<βjp≤1.(29)Fek=(1−2γk+(1−4γk)θl,k)ek3+2γkek21+(1−4γk)θl,k,if0<γk≤0.25;(1−2γk)ek3+(2γk+(4γk−1)θr,k)ek21+(4γk−1)θr,k,if0.25<γk≤0.5;(2γk−1)ek1+(2(1−γk)+(3−4γk)θr,k)ek21+(3−4γk)θr,k,if0.5<γk≤0.75;(2γk−1+(4γk−3)θl,k)ek1+2(1−γk)ek21+(4γk−3)θl,k,if0.75<γk≤1.Consider costscijkp˜, suppliesaip˜, demandsbjp˜and conveyance capacitiese˜kare all mutually independent type-2 triangular fuzzy variables defined bycijkp˜=(cijkp1,cijkp2,cijkp3;θl,ijkp,θr,ijkp),aip˜=(aip1,aip2,aip3;θl,ip,θr,ip),bjp˜=(bjp1,bjp2,bjp3;θl,jp,θr,jp)ande˜k=(ek1,ek2,ek3;θl,k,θr,k). Then we find nearest interval approximations (credibilistic interval approximation, cf. Section 4) ofcijkp˜,aip˜,bjp˜ande˜k, suppose these are[cijkLp,cijkRp],[aiLp,aiRp],[bjLp,bjRp]and [ekL, ekR] respectively. Then with these nearest interval approximations the Model (21) becomesMinZ=∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp.([cijkLp,cijkRp]xijkp)(30)subjectto∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≤[aiLp,aiRp],i=1,2,...,m;p=1,2,...l,∑i=1m∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≥[bjLp,bjRp],j=1,2,...,n;p=1,2,...,l,∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1ndijkpxijkp≤[ekL,ekR],k=1,2,...,K,xijkp≥0,∀i,j,k,p.We first obtain deterministic forms of the uncertain constraints using the idea of possibility degree of interval number (Zhang et al. [52]) representing certain degree by which one interval is larger or smaller than another. Now we denote the left hand side expressions of the source, destination and conveyance capacity constraints of the model (30) bySip,Djpand Ekrespectively. Here the right hand sides of these constraints are interval numbers and left sides are crisp, then the possibility degree of satisfaction of these constraints are defined asPSip≤[aiLp,aiRp]=1,Sip≤aiLp;aiRp−SipaiRp−aiLp,aiLp<Sip≤aiRp;0,Sip>aiRp.PDjp≥[bjLp,bjRp]=0,Djp<bjLp;Djp−bjLpbjRp−bjLp,bjLp≤Djp<bjRp;1,Djp>bjRp.PEk≤[ekL,ekR]=1,Ek≤ekL;ekR−EkekR−ekL,ekL<Ek≤ekR;0,Ek>ekR.Now if the constraints are allowed to be satisfied with some predetermined possibility degree levelαip,βjpand γk(0≤αip,βjp,γk≤1)respectively, i.e.PSip≤[aiLp,aiRp]≥αip,PDjp≥[bjLp,bjRp]≥βjpandPEk≤[ekL,ekR]≥γk∀i, j, k, p, then the equivalent deterministic inequalities of the respective constraints are obtained as follows:(31)Sip≤aiRp−αip(aiRp−aiLp),i=1,2,...,m;p=1,2,...,l,(32)Djp≥bjLp+βjp(bjRp−bjLp),j=1,2,...,n;p=1,2,...,l,(33)Ek≤ekR−γk(ekR−ekL),k=1,2,...,K.Now to deal with objective function we find minimum possible objective function value (sayZ_) and maximum possible objective function value (sayZ¯) for the interval costs[cijkLp,cijkRp], by solving the following two problems:(34)Z_=MincijkLp≤cijkp≤cijkRpMin∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp(cijkpxijkp)(35)Z¯=MaxcijkLp≤cijkp≤cijkRpMin∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp(cijkpxijkp)subject to the above constraints (31)–(33) for both cases.So we get the range of the optimal value of the objective function of the problem (30) as[Z_,Z¯]. Assume that the solution of the problem (34) isx′={xijkp′}with corresponding costsc′={cijkp′}and the solution of the problem (35) isx′′={xijkp′′}with corresponding costsc′′={cijkp′′}, ∀i, j, k, p.Now we find compromise optimal solution by treating above problems (34) and (35) together as bi-objective problem and applying fuzzy linear programming (Zimmermann [51]) as follows:Let us denoteZ1=∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp(cijkp′xijkp)andZ2=∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp(cijkp′′xijkp), so thatZ1(xijkp′)=Z_andZ2(xijkp′′)=Z¯.Now we find lower and upper bound for both the objective asL1=Z1(xijkp′),U1=Z1(xijkp′′)andL2=Z2(xijkp′′),U2=Z2(xijkp′)respectively.Then construct the following two membership function for the objective functions respectively asμ1(Z1)=1,ifZ1≤L1;U1−Z1U1−L1,ifL1<Z1<U1;0,ifZ1≥U1.andμ2(Z2)=1,ifZ2≤L2;U2−Z2U2−L2,ifL2<Z2<U2;0,ifZ2≥U2.Finally solve the following problem(36)Maxλsubjecttoμ1(Z1)≥λ,μ2(Z2)≥λand the constraints (31)–(33)0≤λ≤1.Solving this we get the optimal solution, sayxijkp*, ∀i, j, k, p which minimizes both the objectives Z1, Z2 with certain degree λ=λ* (say) and values of the the objectives Z1, Z2 atxijkp*give the range of the objective value, say[Z_*,Z¯*].The deterministic optimization problems given by (26) and (36) of the model (21) are solved for some data in the next section. The solution techniques used here are the Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) technique [12,23,29] (using LINGO solver) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) [35,43,44]. Here, GA uses real coded representation of variable, Roulette wheel selection, arithmetic cross over and random mutation. For numerical experiment, we set the different parameters on which this GA depends as generation number (MAXGEN)=1000, population size (POPSIZE)=50, probability of cross-over (PXOV ER)=0.9, probability of mutation (PMUT)=0.4.Consider the Model (21) with 3 (p=1, 2, 3) items, 4 (k=1, 2, 3, 4) conveyances, sources i=1, 2 and destinations j=1, 2, 3. Also I1={1, 2}, I2={1, 2, 3}, I3={3}, I4={1, 2}. The transportation costs are given in Tables 1–3. The supplies, demandsand conveyance capacities are as follows:a11=(21,24,25;0.5,0.5),a21=(26,28,30;0.6,0.8),b11=(10,12,14;0.7,0.9),b21=(12,13,15;0.4,0.7),b31=(9,12,15;0.4,0.6),a12=(26,28,31;0.5,1),a22=(20,24,26;0.6,0.8),b12=(14,16,17;0.4,0.6),b22=(11,13,15;0.8,0.5),b32=(10,11,12;0.5,0.5),a13=(24,26,28;0.6,0.9),a23=(32,35,37;0.8,0.5),b13=(16,18,20;0.4,0.6),b23=(12,14,16;0.6,1),b33=(12,15,17;0.5,0.5),e1=(34, 36, 38;0.5, 1), e2=(46, 49, 51;0.6, 0.8), e3=(28, 30, 32;0.7, 0.9), e4=(40, 43, 44;0.5, 0.5).First formulate the chance constrained programming model for this problem as (22). The predetermined general credibility levels for objective function and constraints are taken as α=0.9,αip=0.9,βjp=0.9, γk=0.9, p=1, 2, 3, i=1, 2, j=1, 2, 3, k=1, 2, 3, 4. Then using (26) the equivalent deterministic form of the problem becomesMin∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkp(0.8+0.6θr,ijkp)cijkp3xijkp+0.2cijkp2xijkp1+0.6θr,ijkp(37)subjectto∑j=1n∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≤Faip,i=1,2,...,m;p=1,2,...l,∑i=1m∑k=1Kdijkpxijkp≥Fbjp,j=1,2,...,n;p=1,2,...l,∑p=1l∑i=1m∑j=1ndijkpxijkp≤Fek,k=1,2,...,K,xijkp≥0,dijkp=1,ifp∈Ik;0,otherwise.∀i,j,k,p,where,Faip,FbjpandFekare calculated from (27)–(29) as follows:Fa11=21.46,Fa21=26.29,Fa12=26.30,Fa22=20.58,Fa13=24.29,Fa23=32.40,Fb11=13.74,Fb21=14.71,Fb31=14.55,Fb12=16.85,Fb22=14.69,Fb32=11.84,Fb13=19.70,Fb23=15.75,Fb33=16.69,Fe1=34.30,Fe2=46.44,Fe3=28.28,Fe4=40.46.Solving this problem (37) using LINGO solver, based upon GRG technique, we get the optimum solution as follows:x1111=6.75,x2111=6.99,x2311=5.07,x2321=9.48,x1241=14.71,x2112=3.65,x2312=11.84,x1222=13.1,x1142=13.2,x2242=1.59,x1223=7.17,x1323=8.54,x2323=8.15,x1233=8.58,x2133=19.7and minimum transportation cost (objective value)= 1093.482.The computational time and total solver iterations regarding this solution are 01 sec. and 17 respectively.Using GA we get the following solution:x1111=6.754,x2111=6.983,x2311=5.064,x2321=9.478,x1241=14.694,x2112=3.632,x2312=11.821,x1222=13.087,x1142=13.106,x2242=1.606,x1223=7.168,x1323=8.587,x2323=8.1,x1233=8.582,x2133=19.682.and minimum transportation cost (objective value)= 1092.068.The nearest interval approximations (credibilistic) of the given triangular type-2 fuzzy parameters are calculated using (19) and (20). The corresponding unit transportation costs are presented in Tables 4–6,and supplies, demands, capacities as follows:a11=[22.50,24.50],a21=[26.9904,29.0095],b11=[10.9910,13.0089],b21=[12.4920,14.0158],b31=[10.4835,13.5164],a12=[26.9767,29.5348],a22=[21.9809,25.0095],b12=[14.9890,16.5054],b22=[12.0148,13.9851],b32=[10.50,11.50],a13=[24.9861,27.0138],a23=[33.5222,35.9851],b13=[16.9890,19.0109],b23=[12.9820,15.0179],b33=[13.50,16.0],e1=[34.9767, 37.0232], e2=[47.4856, 50.0095], e3=[28.9910, 31.0089], e4=[41.50, 43.50].Consider that the possibility degree of satisfaction of each of the source, destination and conveyance capacity constraints with interval right hand sides is 0.9. Then the equivalent deterministic forms of all the constraints are obtained using (31)–(33). Now subject to these deterministic constraints we find minimum and maximum possible value of the objective function by solving (34) and (35) and corresponding solutions areobtained as follows:Z_=725.9498;x1311=13.2131,x2111=10.5682,x1121=2.2388,x1221=7.2480,x2221=6.6154,x2312=11.4,x1222=10.8787,x1142=16.3537,x2242=2.9093,x1223=4.4302,x1323=10.3745,x2323=5.3754,x1233=10.3840,x2133=18.8087andZ¯=950.1511;x1111=8.8365,x2111=3.9705,x2311=10.6858,x1221=13.8634,x2321=2.5272,x2112=0.2883,x2312=11.4,x1222=11.1671,x1142=16.0654,x2242=2.6209,x1223=4.4302,x1323=10.3745,x2323=5.3754,x1233=10.3840,x1113=18.8087.We now apply fuzzy linear programming (as discussed in Section 6.2.1) to obtain an unique optimum allocation.We get L1=725.9498, U1=741.4106, L2=950.1511, U2=956.9979 and using (36) compromise optimal solution is obtained asx1111=0.2095,x1311=8.6270,x2111=12.5975,x2311=2.3472,x1221=13.8634,x2321=2.2388,x2312=11.4,x1222=10.8787,x1142=16.3537,x2242=2.9093,x1223=4.4302,x1323=10.3745,x2323=5.3754,x1233=10.3840,x2133=18.8087, λ=0.987,Z_*=726.1475,Z¯*=950.2386.We now find centroid defuzzified value of each triangular type-2 fuzzy parameters (i.e. transportation costs as presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3 and the supplies, demands and conveyance capacities) using centroid type reduction method of Liu[26] as described in Section 3. For this purpose we discretized the continuous domain of each parameter into finite number of points {xi}, such that xi+1−xi=0.05 and break α∈[0, 1] into highest Δ=100 values. Then applying the method, we derived the centroid type-reduced type-1 set for each parameter, each of which is then defuzzified into crisp value by centroid defuzzification. The centroid defuzzified values of corresponding unit transportation costs are presented in Tables 7–9and that of supplies, demands, capacities are as follows:a11=23.3368,a21=27.9999,b11=11.9999,b21=13.3351,b31=11.9999,a12=28.3356,a22=23.3316,b12=15.6657,b22=12.9999,b32=10.9999,a13=25.9999,a23=34.6749,b13=17.9999,b23=13.9999,b33=14.6688,e1=35.9999, e2=48.6678, e3=29.9999, e4=42.3367.Now solving the Model (21) with these defuzzified parametersusing LINGO solver, we have the optimum solution as follows:x1311=10.0017,x2111=11.9999,x2311=1.9982,x1221=13.3351,x2312=10.9999,x1222=12.6699,x1142=15.6657,x2242=0.33,x1223=1.9999,x1323=12.0,x2323=2.6688,x1233=12.0,x2133=17.9999and minimum transportation cost (objective value)= 783.574.
