@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a new regularized boundary integral equation (BIE) method for three-dimensional (3D) potential gradient field. For this method, we firstly construct two special tangential vectors, and then provide a characteristics theorem with respect to the contour integrations of normal and tangential gradients of the fundamental solution. Finally, a new regularized boundary integral equation with indirect unknowns is derived by using the characteristics theorem and a limit theorem. Compared with the direct boundary element method (BEM), the proposed method has three new features: (1) the continuity requirements of density functions are reduced from C1, αto C0, α; (2) the BIE does not involve the hypersingular (HFP) integral and thus its numerical evaluation is more easy and precise; (3) any potential gradients on the boundary, not limited to normal gradients, can now be calculated. Numerical results illustrate that the present method is computationally efficient, accurate, and convergent with an increasing number of boundary elements.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The boundary element method (BEM) has been developed to be a powerful numerical method for solving the potential problems [1–4]. The method reduces the dimensionality of numerical problems by one via an integral transformation of differential equations. However, there exist singularities in the boundary integral equations (BIEs) due to the singular fundamental solution. Therefore, the key of the BEM is how to efficiently deal with the singular integrals [5,6].Many research efforts have so far been devoted to the accurate and efficient evaluation of singular integrals in the BIEs, and numerous numerical techniques were developed. These methods can be generally divided into two categories: the local strategies [7–20], and the global strategies [21–30]. The former ones include, but are not limited to, analytical and semi-analytical techniques [7,8], new Gaussian quadrature method [9,10], the local regularization method [11–15], transformation method [16,17], finite-part integral [18,19], and subtraction technique [20], etc. Among these methods, the local regularization technique proposed by Guiggiani et al. [11,12] can be used to handle various orders of singularities. For this technique, every quantity in singular integrals has to be extended as Taylor's series about the local distance, which is complex mathematically and not easy to program. Gao [14,15] presented another technique to regularize the singular integrals, in which the singular boundary element is broken up into a few sub-elements. The sub-elements involving the singular point are evaluated analytically to remove the singularities by expressing the non-singular parts of the integration kernels as polynomials of the distance r. The latter ones indirectly calculate the singular integrals by developing new regularized BIEs, such as the virtual BEM [21,22], the null field method [23,24], the simple solution method [25,26], and the regularization methods developed by Zhang et al. [27–30].In the past, most of researchers focused on regularized BIEs with direct variables. Unlike the direct methods, Zhang [27] was the first who derived an indirect regularized BIE that was not found in previous BEM literature according to the author best knowledge. Recently, the developed regularized method [27] was extended to solving the two-dimensional (2D) anisotropic potential [28] and orthotropic elastic problems [29]. Compared with the direct BEM, the indirect regularized BIEs have the following advantages. First, the continuity requirement of density functions is reduced. In order to remove the singularities, the regularized form of the hypersingular (HFP) integral in the direct BEM can be expressed as∫Γ(u(x)−u(y)−uk(x)(xk−yk))O(1r2)dΓx,k=1,2.The existence of this integral in the Riemann sense requires that the density function u(x) belongs to C1, α[31]. However, the existence of the following regularized integral in Ref. [27] only needs that the density function u(x) belongs to C0, α∫Γ(u(x)−u(y))O(1r)dΓx,k=1,2.Second, the BIE does not involve the hypersingular (HFP) integral and thus its numerical evaluation is more easy and precise. Finally, any potential gradients on the boundary, not limited to the normal gradients, can now be calculated by using the indirect regularized method. In addition, the Galerkin boundary node method (GBNM) [32–34] was developed by combining the moving least-squares approximation and the indirect BIEs. Thus, the new regularized technique for the indirect BIEs will promote the development of the GBNM.It is not an easy work to extend the approach in Ref. [27] for three-dimensional (3D) problems. For plane problems, there is only a unit tangent vector along the boundary curve, and the contour integrations of tangential gradients about relative quantities are equal to zero. Furthermore, the contour integration of normal gradient can be transformed to that of the tangential gradient by using the relationshipn1=t2,n2=−t1of the unit tangent vector t(t1, t2) and gradient vector n(n1, n2). For 3D problems, however, the unit tangent vector is any vector involved in the tangent plane, and the contour integration of any tangential gradient about relative quantities is usually unequal to zero. The contour integration of the normal gradient is also not connected with that of the tangential gradient because of no relationship between the unit tangent vector t(t1, t2, t3) and gradient vector n(n1, n2, n3) exceptn·t=0. For these reasons, we were unable to extend the approach in Ref. [27] for 3D problems until now.In this paper, we present a new indirect regularized BIE for the 3D potential gradient field. Two special tangential vectors are constructed. Then, a characteristics theorem about the contour integrations of normal and tangential gradients of the fundamental solution is provided. Based on the characteristics theorem and a limit theorem, we finally develop a new regularized BIE with indirect unknowns. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. A brief outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents four theorems. In Section 3, we establish the regularized BIE based on these theorems. In Section 4, the details of boundary elements are given. Section 5 provides numerical examples. In Section 6, we conclude the paper.In this paper, we always assume that Ω is a bounded domain in R3,Γ=∂ΩandΩc=R3−(Ω∪Γ).n(x)=(n1,n2,n3)is an outward unit normal vector of Γ at a boundary point x.m1(x)=(n2+kn3,−n1,−kn1)andm2(x)=(n2,−n1+n3/k,−n2/k)(k is a parameter, and k ≠ 0) belong to the tangent plane of Γ at the point x. Here, m1(x) and m2(x) are constructed to compose a linearly independent set with n(x). Then, the potential gradient in any direction can be expressed as a linear combination of the normal and two tangential gradients. Finally, we can regularize the BIE of potential gradient by using a characteristics theorem about the contour integrations of normal and tangential gradients of the fundamental solution.The fundamental solution G of 3D potential problem [35] can be expressed as(1)G(x,y)=14πr(x,y)wherex=(x1,x2,x3),y=(y1,y2,y3)are the field and source points, respectively. r(x, y) is the distance between the source and field points. The fundamental solution (1) has an identity as follows:(2)∫Γ∂G(x,y)∂n(x)dΓ={−1,y∈Ω0,y∈ΩcThe proof of this identity can be found in Refs. [36,37]. To derive a new regularized BIE with indirect unknowns, we also present some new identities.Theorem 1Let k satisfies the following two conditions:(1) If n1 ≠ 0 andn32+4n1n2≥0, thenk≠n3±n32+4n1n22n1;(2) Ifn1=0,n3≠0, thenk≠−n2/n3.Then, (m1, m2, n) is a linearly independent set.ProofAssume m1, m2, n are linearly dependent, we will hold(3)D=|n2+kn3n2n1−n1−n1+1kn3n2−kn1−1kn2n3|=−kn1+1kn2+n3=0Eq. (3) can be transformed as(4)n1k2−n3k−n2=0As n1 ≠ 0, the above equation has a solutionk=n3±n32+4n1n22n1if and only ifn32+4n1n2≥0, and conversely, it has no solution. Asn1=0, Eq. (4) can be expressed as(5)n3k+n2=0If n3 ≠ 0, Eq. (5) has solutionk=−n2/n3. Asn3=0, there is no solution due ton12+n22+n32=1. Therefore, the assumption is false.□Theorem 2Let S be a piecewise smooth surface, and g(x) be a derivable function on S. If (m1, m2, n) is a linearly independent set, then there holds(6)∇g(x)=a(x)∇g(x)·m1+b(x)∇g(x)·m2+c(x)∇g(x)·nwhere∇=(∂∂x1,∂∂x2,∂∂x3), andai(x),bi(x),ci(x)(i=1,2,3)are the components of vectorsa(x), b(x), c(x) respectively, which can be expressed as(7)ai(x)=(δi×m2)·n(m1×m2)·n,bi(x)=(m1×δi)·n(m1×m2)·n,ci(x)=(m1×m2)·δi(m1×m2)·n,δi=(δi1,δi2,δi3),i=1,2,3ProofAccording to Eq. (6), we have(8)∂g(x)∂xi=ai(x)∇g(x)·m1+bi(x)∇g(x)·m2+ci(x)∇g(x)·n,i=1,2,3and then(9)δij=ai(x)mj1+bi(x)mj2+ci(x)nji,j=1,2,3wheremj1,mj2,nj(j=1,2,3)are the components of vectors m1, m2, n. Since (m1, m2, n) is a linearly independent set, we obtain(10)ai(x)=(δi×m2)·n(m1×m2)·n,bi(x)=(m1×δi)·n(m1×m2)·n,ci(x)=(m1×m2)·δi(m1×m2)·n,δi=(δi1,δi2,δi3),i=1,2,3.□Theorem 3Let Γ be a piecewise smooth surface. Then, the fundamental solution (1) has(11)∫Γ∂G(x,y)∂mi(x)dΓ=0,y∈ΩorΩc,i=1,2ProofFor conciseness, we merely give the proof of Eq. (11) as y ∈ Ω. It can be proved in a similar way as y ∈ Ωc. Let Bɛ(y) (or Bɛ) denote a sphere with the radius ɛ and center at the point y in Ω. SettingΩ^=Ω−Ω∩B¯ɛ,Γɛ=∂BɛAsi=1, there is(12)∫Γ∂G(x,y)∂m1(x)dΓ=∫∫ΓPdx2dx3+Qdx3dx1+Rdx1dx2whereP=14πx2−y2+k(x3−y3)r3,Q=−14πx1−y1r3,R=−14πk(x1−y1)r3. Applying the Green formula in domainΩ^, we have(13)∫∫Γ∪ΓɛPdx2dx3+Qdx3dx1+Rdx1dx2=∫∫∫Ω^(∂P∂x1+∂Q∂x2+∂R∂x3)dx1dx2dx3=0It is easy to verify that∫∫ΓɛPdx2dx3+Qdx3dx1+Rdx1dx2=0, and then we can derive Eq. (11).Asi=2, the proof of Eq. (11) can be derived in almost the same way.□Theorem 4Let Γ be a piecewise smooth surface (open or closed), andx^be a point on Γ. Supposeh=|y−x^|andd=infx∈Γ|y−x|. If ψ(x) ∈ C0, α(Γ) and h/d ≤ K1(K1is a constant), then there holds(14)limy→x^∫Γxk−yk|x−y|3[ψ(x)−ψ(x^)]dΓ=∫Γxk−x^k|x−x^|3[ψ(x)−ψ(x^)]dΓ(k=1,2,3)ProofAsk=1, we will give the derivation of Eq. (14). For any ɛ > 0, the difference between the left and right hand sides of Eq. (14) is(15)I=∫Γ[x1−y1|x−y|3−x1−x^1|x−x^|3][ψ(x)−ψ(x^)]dΓThe integral I is divided into two parts: I1 overΓδ={x∈Γ∥x−x^|≤δ}and I2 overΓc=Γ−Γδ. For I1, by using|yk−x^k|≤K1|y−x|, we have(16)|x1−y1|x−y|3−x1−x^1|x−x^|3|≤|(x1−y1)|x−x^|3|x−y|3|x−x^|3|+||x−y|3(x1−x^1)|x−y|3|x−x^|3|≤|(x1−y1)|x−x^|2|x−y|3|x−x^|2|+1|x−x^|2≤K2|x−x^|2where K2 is a constant.□In addition, noting ψ(x) ∈ C0, α(Γ), i.e.,|ψ(x)−ψ(x^)|≤K3|x−x^|α(with constants K3, α and 0 < α ≤ 1), it yields|I1|≤K2K3∫Γδ1|x−x^|2−αdΓ. Further, let x be a smooth point on Γ, and S be a circular surface with radiusr1=|x−x^|≤δand center at pointx^. Then, considering Γδand S are bounded, we have |dΓδ| ≤ K4dS (with constant K4). Therefore, there holds(17)|I1|≤K2K3K4∫s1r12−αdS=K2K3K4(2πδαα)≤K5δαwhereK5=2παK2K3K4. By choosing a sufficiently small δ, one has |I1| ≤ ɛ/2For I2, we have(18)|I2|≤∫Γc[x1−y1|x−y|3−x1−x^1|x−x^|3][ψ(x)−ψ(x^)]dΓNoting that δ has been fixed andx^does not belong to Γc; therefore, it is easy to obtain |I2| ≤ ɛ/2 by taking sufficiently small|y−x^|.Ask=2,3, the proof of Eq. (14) can be performed in almost the same way.In this section, we will establish a new regularized indirect BIE for 3D potential gradients. The indirect BIE for potential can be expressed as [1,36](19)u(y)=∫Γϕ(x)G(x,y)dΓ,y∈Ω˜where the integral kernel exhibits at most the weak singularity, andΩ˜=ΩorΩc. Based on Eq. (19), the potential gradient can be given as(20)∂u(y)∂yi=∫Γϕ(x)∂G(x,y)∂yidΓ=−∫Γϕ(x)∂G(x,y)∂xidΓ,y∈Ω˜where higher order singularities occur in Eq. (20). For any smooth pointx^on Γ, according to Theorem 2, the above equation can be recast as follows:(21)∂u(y)∂yi=−∫Γ[ϕ(x)−ϕ(x^)]∂G(x,y)∂xidΓ−ϕ(x^)∫Γ{ai(x)∂G(x,y)∂m1(x)+bi(x)∂G(x,y)∂m2(x)+ci(x)∂G(x,y)∂n(x)}dΓ,y∈Ω˜By using Eq. (2) and Theorem 3, Eq. (21) can be transformed as(22)∂u(y)∂yi=κϕ(x^)ci(x^)−∫Γ[ϕ(x)−ϕ(x^)]∂G(x,y)∂xidΓ−ϕ(x^)∫Γ{[ai(x)−ai(x^)]∂G(x,y)∂m1(x)+[bi(x)−bi(x^)]∂G(x,y)∂m2(x)+[ci(x)−ci(x^)]∂G(x,y)∂n(x)}dΓ,y∈Ω˜where κ is equal to 1 for interior problems and 0 for exterior problems. If ni(x) ∈ C0, α(Γ) atx^∈Γ, then there are ai(x), bi(x), ci(x) ∈ C0, α(Γ) atx^∈Γ. Therefore, asy→x^and by Theorem 4, we can finally obtain the regularized BIEs of potential and its gradients with replacingx^by y in Eq. (22):(23)u(y)=∫Γϕ(x)G(x,y)dΓ,y∈Γ(24)∂u(y)∂yi=κϕ(y)ci(y)−∫Γ[ϕ(x)−ϕ(y)]∂G(x,y)∂xidΓ−ϕ(y)∫Γ{[ai(x)−ai(y)]∂G(x,y)∂m1(x)+[bi(x)−bi(y)]∂G(x,y)∂m2(x)+[ci(x)−ci(y)]∂G(x,y)∂n(x)}dΓ,y∈ΓNote that any potential gradients can be calculated, if (m1, m2, n) is a linearly independent set. Obviously, it is easy to select k such that m1, m2, n are linearly independent according to Theorem 1. In addition, the regularized formulation for the Neumann boundary condition can be obtained by using ∇u · n with Eq. (24).In the BEM, the constant, linear and quadratic elements are commonly used to discretize the BIEs. Generally, we show the details of the eight-node quadratic element. In addition, the exact element is provided as a special case.For the eight-node quadratic element [38], we assumeNq(ξ1,ξ2)(q=1,…,8)denote the shape functions, i.e.(25)N1(ξ1,ξ2)=14(1−ξ1)(1−ξ2)(−ξ1−ξ2−1),N5(ξ1,ξ2)=12(1−ξ12)(1−ξ2),N2(ξ1,ξ2)=14(1+ξ1)(1−ξ2)(ξ1−ξ2−1),N6(ξ1,ξ2)=12(1+ξ1)(1−ξ22),N3(ξ1,ξ2)=14(1+ξ1)(1+ξ2)(ξ1+ξ2−1),N7(ξ1,ξ2)=12(1−ξ12)(1+ξ2),N4(ξ1,ξ2)=14(1−ξ1)(1+ξ2)(−ξ1+ξ2−1),N8(ξ1,ξ2)=12(1−ξ1)(1−ξ22),in which ξ1, ξ2 are the dimensionless coordinates and−1≤ξ1,ξ2≤1. Then the boundary point x can be approximated as(26)x=∑i=18Ni(ξ1,ξ2)xiwhere xiis the interpolation point as shown in Fig. 1.The boundary quantity ϕ(x) can be approximated as the following equation:(27)ϕ(x)=∑i=18Ni(ξ1/α,ξ2/α)ϕiin which ϕiis the value of the boundary quantity at the nodex^ias shown in Fig. 1, and α ∈ (0, 1).In 3D space, there exist some geometric surfaces which can be expressed as(28)x=f(θ,φ)where f is vector function, and θ, φ belong to a bounded interval. Then, θ, φ can be exactly represented by using the following linear interpolations:(29)θ=1−ξ12θ1+1+ξ12θ2,φ=1−ξ22φ1+1+ξ22φ2,−1≤ξ1,ξ2≤1whereθi,φi(i=1,2)are coordinates of end points of the exact element [38]. In addition, we employ the same interpolation formulation (27) for the boundary quantity ϕ(x) in the exact element.The details of the numerical implementation have been provided. To solve the indirect BIEs (19)–(24) numerically, the boundary of the interesting domain is firstly discretized into a limited set of piecewise continuously surfaces. Then, they can be approximated by using the boundary elements, such as eight-node quadratic elements or exact elements. The boundary quantity ϕ(x) is approximated by the interpolation formulation (27). Finally, we can form a system of linear equation based on the boundary conditions. Once ϕ(x) has been determined by solving the system of linear equation, the numerical results of potential and its gradients can be obtained.In this section, four numerical examples with different boundary conditions (BCs) are provided to verify the efficiency, accuracy and convergence of the present method. The parameter k of tangential vectors m1 and m2 is set to 0.5 for these examples. For accuracy and convergence analysis, we define an average relative error as(30)Er=1N∑i=1N|ue−unue|where N denotes the number of notes in all boundary elements, ueand unare exact and numerical solutions, respectively. In addition, let NE be the number of boundary elements,Erqithe average relative error of the temperature flux ∂u/∂xi.In this test, we consider a temperature field in a cube with a sphere in its center (See Fig. 2). The center of the cube is (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), and the radius of the sphere is 0.2. The following exact solution is used for the patch test(31)u(x1,x2,x3)=x12+x22−2x32The Dirichlet and the Neumann BCs are respectively imposed on the boundaries of the cube and the sphere.In the BEM model, the boundaries of the cube and the sphere are respectively discretized by 24 linear elements with 192 nodes and 18 exact elements with 144 nodes. Fig. 3shows the numerical results of the temperature fluxes ∂u/∂x1 and ∂u/∂x2 at the boundary nodes in the planez=0.5. As we can see from the Fig., the numerical results match the exact solutions very well, which illustrates the accuracy of the proposed method.Secondly, we consider the temperature field in an irregular sphere (See Fig. 4) with the Dirichlet BC. The irregular sphere is represented by the parametric surface(32)Γ={(r,φ,θ)|r=1+sin(2θ)sin(15φ)/40,0≤φ≤π,0≤θ<2π}The exact solution is given as(33)u(r,φ,θ)=R2(sin2φsin2θ−cos2φ)+3RsinφcosθThe Dirichlet BC is imposed on the boundary.By using 50 exact elements with 400 nodes, Fig. 5plots the variation curves of temperature fluxes ∂u/∂x1 and ∂u/∂x2 at the boundary points (r, π/2, θ). It can be seen that the numerical results of the present method are in good agreement with the exact solutions. Table 1shows average relative errors of fluxes ∂u/∂x1 and ∂u/∂x2 at all boundary nodes to analyze the convergence of the developed method. We can observe that the numerical errors decrease with an increasing number of boundary elements. This demonstrates the method is stable and convergent.Next, we consider the temperature field in a peanut-shaped domain as shown in Fig. 6. The surface of the model is expressed as(34)(x1,x2,x3)=(r(φ)cosφ,r(φ)sinφcosθ,r(φ)sinφsinθ)wherer(φ)=cos(2φ)+1.3−sin2(2φ), φ ∈ [0, π] and θ ∈ [0, 2π).For this model, four types of temperature fields are considered as(a)Linear type(35)u(x1,x2,x3)=2x1+4x2+3x3Quadratic type 1(36)u(x1,x2,x3)=3x1x2+10x2x3+5x1x3Quadratic type 2(37)u(x1,x2,x3)=3x12+3x22−6x32Cubic type(38)u(x1,x2,x3)=x13+2x23+3x33−3x1x32−6x2x12−9x3x22The corresponding Dirichlet BC is imposed on the boundary.For the BEM model, the surface is discretized with 54 eight-node quadratic elements. Table 2lists the average relative errors of temperature fluxes∂u/∂xi(i=1,2,3)at all boundary nodes. It can be found that the results of the present method are accuracy for four types of temperature fields in the peanut-shaped domain with Dirichlet BC. In addition, Fig. 7plots the convergence curves of average relative errors of temperature flux ∂u/∂x3 at all boundary nodes. As we can see from this Fig., the developed method works well and shows a stable convergence with an increasing number of boundary nodes.Finally, we consider an exterior problem of the temperature field with the boundary as shown in Fig. 8. The surface of the model is consisted of the following boundaries Γ1 and Γ2:(39)Γ1:x1=(4+cosθ1)cosφ1,x2=(4+cosθ1)sinφ1,x3=sinθ1,0≤θ1≤2π,0≤φ1≤2πΓ2:x1=2sinθ2cosφ2,x2=2sinθ2sinφ2,x3=2cosθ2,0≤θ2≤π,0≤φ2≤2πThe temperature field is represented by(40)u(x1,x2,x3)=x+yx2+y2+x+zx2+z2+y+zy2+z2The Dirichlet and Neumann BCs are imposed on the boundaries of the torus and the sphere, respectively.There are 96 exact elements on the whole boundary (64 elements on the surface of the torus and 32 elements on the remaining surface). Figs. 9and 10respectively plot the analytical and numerical results of the temperature flux ∂u/∂x1 on the boundary. It should be noted that the color images of Figs. 9 and 10 are in log-scale, i.e.log|u˜|(u˜is numerical or analytical solution). As we can observe, the contours of numerical results are almost the same with those of exact solutions, which again illustrates the accuracy of the proposed method.To further verify the convergence and stability of the method, Table 3lists the average relative errors of temperature fluxes∂u/∂xi(i=1,2,3)at all boundary nodes. With an increasing number of boundary elements, we can see that the numerical errors obtained by the present method decrease.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, a new regularized boundary integral equation is presented for three-dimensional potential gradient field, based on two special tangential vectors, the characteristics and limit theorems. The method can evaluate any potential gradients on the boundary, but not limited to the normal gradients. Four numerical experiments with various geometries and boundary conditions are provided to verify the present method. Numerical results for both interior and exterior potential problems have been obtained. In a summary of the overall performances, the proposed regularized boundary integral equation is computational efficient, accurate, stable and convergent when increasing the number of boundary elements.The developed technique can be extended to regularize the indirect BIEs for 3D elastic and Stokes problems, which are currently under intense investigation and will be reported in a subsequent report.
