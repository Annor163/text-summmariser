@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Cardinal and ordinal inconsistencies are important and popular research topics in the study of decision making with pair-wise comparison matrices (PCMs). Few of the currently-employed tactics are capable of simultaneously dealing with both cardinal and ordinal inconsistency issues in one model, and most are heavily dependent on the method chosen for weight (priorities) derivation or the obtained closest matrix by optimization method that may change many of the original values. In this paper, we propose a Hadamard product induced bias matrix model, which only requires the use of the data in the original matrix to identify and adjust the cardinally inconsistent element(s) in a PCM. Through graph theory and numerical examples, we show that the adapted Hadamard model is effective in identifying and eliminating the ordinal inconsistencies. Also, for the most inconsistent element identified in the matrix, we develop innovative methods to improve the consistency of a PCM. The proposed model is only dependent on the original matrix, is independent of the methods chosen to derive the priority vectors, and preserves most of the original information in matrix A since only the most inconsistent element(s) need(s) to be modified. Our method is much easier to implement than any of the existing models, and the values it recommends for replacement outperform those derived from the literature. It significantly enhances matrix consistency and improves the reliability of PCM decision making.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Decision makers (DMs) often encounter complicated decision problems that involve multiple tangible and intangible conflicting criteria and alternatives (Forman & Gass, 2001; Raiffa & Keeney, 1976; Saaty, 1980; Tsetlin & Winkler, 2007; Vansnick, 1986). The intangible and subjective aspects of judgments associated with human factors need to be integrated into an open and flexible multi-criteria decision making model (Altuzarra, Moreno-Jiménez, & Salvador, 2010; Saaty, 1972). Due to the limitations of human capacity and DMs’ experiences and knowledge, it is difficult to compare several criteria or alternatives simultaneously (Hu & Mehrotra, 2012; Saaty, 1986, 1994). However, it is relatively easy to determine the dominance of one alternative over the other with respect to a given criterion at a time. As such, the pairwise comparison method becomes an important tool for multi-criteria decision making. In this research, we focus on the pairwise comparison matrix with the goals of improving its consistency and enhancing its reliability in decision making.The pairwise comparison technique, originated by Thurstone (1927), is widely employed to handle subjective and objective judgments in multi-criteria decision making (Herman & Koczkodaj, 1996; Saaty, 1980, 1994, 1996, 2006; Zhü, 2014). All pair-compared results are arranged in a matrix A=(aij)n×n, where aij>0, aij=1/ajiand aij=aikakjfor i, j, k=1,2,…,n, and popularly termed pairwise comparison matrix (PCM hereinafter) or judgment matrix in literature.The values in PCM are provided by decision makers based on their judgment and expertise. The matrix may be inconsistent due to the complexity of the decision problem or the limits of DMs’ capacities and skills. Thus, the consistency issue has been an ongoing and active research topic, and a number of models have been developed for it (e.g., Saaty, 1986; Barzilai, 1999; Cao, Leung, & Law, 2008; Li & Ma, 2007; Xu & Wei, 1999; Altuzarra et al., 2010; Ergu, Kou, Peng, & Shi, 2011; Grošelj & Zadnik Stirn, 2012; Siraj, Mikhailov, & Keane, 2012, and Liu, Zhang, & Zhang, 2014).The consistency issue in matrix A=(aij)n×ncan be classified into two types: (1) cardinal inconsistency, e.g., if A=mB, B=nC, but A≠mnC; and (2) ordinal inconsistency, e.g. if A>B, B>C, but C⩾A. More generally, if aij=aikakjholds for all i, j, and k, then it is cardinal consistent, and matrix A is perfectly consistent; otherwise, it is cardinal inconsistent. Similarly, if aij⩾1, ajk⩾1, and aik⩾1, then it is ordinal consistent; otherwise, it is ordinal inconsistent.With the above classification, we can group the methods for tackling the consistency issues into three groups. The first one deals with cardinal inconsistency, the second one deals with ordinal inconsistency, and the third one deals with both (see detailed review in Section 2). Although consistency ratio (CR) that relies on maximum eigenvalue is the commonly used index to test whether a PCM is consistent, we found that most consistency improvement methods require the priority weights of the PCM (see Sections 2 and EC.1). However, there are more than 20 methods (Choo & Wedley, 2004; Lin, 2007; Kou & Lin, 2014) available for deriving the priority weights in a PCM. When the PCM is consistent, all methods will arrive at the same weights. However, if the PCM is inconsistent, the priority weights derived from different methods could differ significantly, and using such weights prevent us from correctly identifying the inconsistent elements and providing accurate estimates.Through Monte-Carlo simulation, Siraj et al. (2012) show that a high percentage of consistent matrices (i.e., with CR<0.1) are in fact ordinally inconsistent. They further prove that if the matrices are ordinally inconsistent, then different prioritization methods give different ordinal rankings. Yet, their model focuses solely on ordinal inconsistency. The Condition of Order Preservation (COP) proposed by Bana e Costa and Vansnick (2008) states that for alternatives Ai,Aj, Ak, and Ah, when Aiis preferred to Aj, and Akis preferred to Ah, but the intensity of preference of Aiover Ajis stronger than that of Akover Ah, then the priority weights ω not only satisfy ωi>ωjand ωk>ωh(preservation of order of preference) but also respect the relationship that ωi/ωj>ωk/ωh(preservation of order of intensity of preference). They prove that some priority weights in the AHP do not satisfy the COP even when CR<0.1. To tackle both types of inconsistencies in PCM, a requisite for a practicable model is that the proposed methodology does not depend on priority weights of the PCM.In this paper, we tackle both cardinal and ordinal inconsistencies and aim to achieve two objectives. The first is to propose a method to identify cardinal inconsistency and to improve the consistency. Such a method has to be objective and independent of the priority-deriving methods chosen. To achieve such an objective, we transform the perfectly consistent condition aij=aikakjinto aikakjaji=1. We discover that the Hadamard product operator in mathematics can be adapted to induce a bias matrix. We thus developed a Hadamard product induced bias matrix (HPIBM) to identify the inconsistent elements in a matrix efficiently and effectively. Different from the Hadamard product operator methods proposed by Saaty (2003), and Cao et al. (2008) (see Section 2.1), the proposed HPIBM only depends on the original data in PCM and is independent of the prioritization method chosen and weights derived.The second goal of this paper is to extend the proposed HPIBM to identify and eliminate the ordinal inconsistency. Since three-way cycles are the basic forms of all ordinal inconsistencies, we further examine the forms of ordinally inconsistent judgments by combining the proposed HPIBM and graph theory. We found that the ordinal inconsistency can be readily identified by constructing the preference Boolean matrix and applying it to the proposed HPIBM.The advantages of the HPIBM model we proposed in this research are fivefold:(1)It is independent of the prioritization methods, since it is only based on the original numbers in PCM.It is easier than existing methods, as the most cardinally inconsistent elements can be identified quickly and effortlessly by observing the largest values in the induced bias matrix C.The inconsistent elements can be adjusted by the derived formula, and the consistency ratio can clearly be improved.It can also be used to identify the ordinal inconsistency.It is independent of the scale employed in the PCM and is suitable for any PCM whose entries are positive and reciprocal.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing models for identifying inconsistency. In Section 3, we mathematically prove the validity of the proposed HPIBM model for cardinal inconsistency identification and develop procedures to improve the inconsistency. We then make use of graph theory in Section 4 to justify the application of HPIBM to ordinal inconsistency identification. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate and compare the proposed model in this section. The paper is summarized and concluded in Section 5.Much attention has been paid to the inconsistency issues of PCM. Some researchers focus on cardinal inconsistency, while others concentrate on the ordinal inconsistency. Very few have addressed both inconsistency issues and none has tackled both cardinal and ordinal inconsistencies with one model. We review the inconsistency identification literature below.For a positive reciprocal decision making PCM A=(aij)n×n, Harker (1987) proposed a formula based on the priority weights ωiof positive matrix A; and the priority weights viof its transpose matrix AT. He labeled the largest absolute value(s) as the most inconsistent element. Saaty (1980, 1994, 2003) believed the most inconsistent element can be identified by observing the maximum value in the absolute differences B=[bij]=[∣aij−ωi/ωj∣] and the perturbation matrix ε=A∘WT=[aijωj/ωi], where ωiand ωjare the priority weights of matrix A, symbol “∘” represents Hadamard product. Based on these models, Xu and Wei (1999) developed an auto-adaptive algorithm to improve the consistency. Similarly, from the perturbation matrix reviewed above, Cao et al. (2008) proposed an iterative algorithm to adjust the deviation matrix and improve the consistency ratio, which is based on the model B=[ωi/ωj]∘[aij/ωi/ωj]γ, where symbol “∘” represents Hadamard product. Details of these models can be found in the e-companion, Section EC.1.Ali, Cook, and Kress (1986) defined the number of transitivity violations by checking whether ωi>ωjand aij<1. Gass (1998) used the methods from tournaments and graph theory to determine the number of three-way cycles in a PCM, and to detect these cycles through standard linear programming. Correspondingly, Kwiesielewicz and van Uden (2004) developed an algorithm to test the incongruity of the judgments in a PCM; while Birnbaum (2007) designed a statistical technique to test the intransitivity of preferences predicted by a lexicographic semi-order. Similarly, Diaye and Urdanivia (2009) found that the violation of the preference transitivity axiom significantly affects the violations of utility function maximizing behavior, while Mikhailov and Knowles (2010) developed an evolutionary optimization algorithm based on ωiand ωjto obtain a priority vector with minimum number of violations. Then again, Pahikkala, Waegeman, Tsivtsivadze, Salakoski, and De Baets (2010) presented a new kernel function to infer intransitive reciprocal relations in problems where transitivity violations cannot be considered as noise. Finally, Siraj et al. (2012) proposed a heuristic algorithm to improve ordinal consistency by identifying and eliminating intransitivity in PCMs.Few researchers simultaneously focus on both the cardinal and the ordinal inconsistencies. Genest and Zhang (1996) proposed a graphical method to detect the ordinal and cardinal inconsistency based on a Gower plot (Gower, 1977). However, they did not offer inconsistency adjustment method. Kwiesielewicz and van Uden (2004) attributed the cardinal inconsistency to the 9-point semantic scale, and proposed to use a scale with even number to avoid cardinal inconsistency. Besides, they developed an algorithm to test the contradiction of judgment matrices. However, they paid more attention to ordinal inconsistency and did not provide the method of adjusting the cardinal inconsistency. González-Pachón and Romero (2004) proposed a distance-based framework to deal with both the cardinal and the ordinal inconsistencies. However, under this distance-based framework, there are two approaches proposed for cardinal inconsistency and ordinal inconsistency respectively. In the first approach, a “similar matrix” that holds reciprocity and cardinal consistency properties “as much as possible” is searched by a goal programming. However, owing to “the obtained matrices may be no reciprocal and/or no consistent”, they use GP approach to calculate the associate priority weights (APW). In the second approach, they use a Boolean matrix to model the ordinal information and an extended GP to optimize it. The ordinal inconsistency is identified by calculating the priorities of two different matrices under different values of λ. However, they did not explain how to eliminate the ordinal inconsistency. Li and Ma (2007) and Ma and Li (2011) used the Gower plot to detect inconsistencies, and employed two global optimization models to adjust the identified ordinal and cardinal inconsistencies.The models discussed above are complicated to implement in practice. Some depend on the priority weights of a PCM and often can only be used to detect one type of the inconsistencies. There are many weight-derivation methods, but different methods yield different priority weights when the original matrix A is inconsistent, while others deal with the inconsistencies by optimization methods, which may change most of the original elements. In the following, we propose a Hadamard product induced bias matrix model to deal with both the cardinal and the ordinal inconsistencies. The proposed model only requires the original matrix, without the need to choose the weights deriving method to derive the priority; it is also straightforward to implement than the existing models since it is only based on the original matrix and only the most inconsistent element(s) needs to be modified, which may preserve most of the original information of expert judgments.The most commonly faced inconsistency issue in PCM is cardinal inconsistency. For some i, j, and k, if there exists aij≠aikakj, then the PCM is said to be cardinally inconsistent. As perfect consistency is unattainable in practice, a certain degree of inconsistency in the PCM is expected and acceptable. Saaty (1980) developed a measure of consistency ratio (CR), and showed that a PCM is at an acceptable level of consistency if CR⩽0.1. Otherwise, the inconsistent elements should be adjusted to avoid invalid decision.To propose a method that is independent of the priority weights so as to effectively identify the inconsistent elements, the Hadamard product operator in mathematics is used to develop the Hadamard product induced bias matrix (HPIBM). The model only depends on the original information of PCM and is unconnected to the priority weights. We now present the theorem of the model.Theorem of HPIBMIf the pairwise comparison matrix A is perfectly or approximately consistent, then the following induced bias matrix (IBM) C in Eq.(1)holds. Otherwise, there is at least one element in each row (column) of matrix C that deviates significantly from 1(1)C=1nAA∘AT=(cij)=1n∑k=1naikakjaji=Uifaikakjaji=1≈Uifaikakjaji≈1wherecij=1n∑k=1naikakjaji;U=1⋯1⋮⋱⋮1⋯1; n denotes the order of A; and AT is the transpose of matrix A. The symbol ‘∘’ denotes Hadamard product, e.g. C=A∘B indicating cij=aijbij for all i and j.There are two propositions in the theorem of HPIBM: the original proposition and the inverse negative proposition, which are mathematically proved below.(1)The Original Proposition: if the PCM is perfectly (or approximately) consistent, then all elements in matrix C are equal (or close) to onesIf the PCM is perfectly consistent, then aikakj=aijholds for all i, j and k. Since aij=1/aji, the perfect consistency condition can further be transformed into:(2)aikakj=aij⇒aikakj=1aji⇒aikakjaji=1So(3)cij=1n∑k=1naikakjaji=1n∑k=1n1=nn=1Thus, all elements in matrix C are 1s if the matrix is perfectly consistent. The approximated case can easily be proved by replacing the equality symbol “=” with the approximated symbol “≈”.□(2)The Inverse Negative Proposition: if the PCM is inconsistent, then at least one element in each row (column) of matrix C will deviate from 1We use the proof by contradiction to prove the inverse negative proposition of HPIBM. Assume matrix A is inconsistent, i.e. for any i, there exist some j and k (i, j, k=1,2,…,n) such that aij≠aikakj or aikajkaji≠1,but all elements in the ith row of the induced bias matrix C are equal to ones, instead of having at least one element greater than 1. In short, we assume aij≠aikakjfor some j and k, and ci1=1, ci2=1,…,cin=1. We will obtain the following equalities:(4)ci1=1n∑k=1naikak1a1i=1n∑k=1naikak11ai1=1ci2=1n∑k=1naikak2a2i=1n∑k=1naikak21ai2=1⋮cin=1n∑k=1naikaknani=1n∑k=1naikakn1ain=1Add up all the equalities in (4), we find(5)1n∑k=1naikak11ai1+1n∑k=1naikak21ai2+⋯+1n∑k=1naikakn1ain=n,Equality (5) can be further simplified to(6)∑j=1n∑k=1naikakj1aij=∑j=1n∑k=1nakjaikaij=n2Since matrix A is a positive reciprocal matrix, i.e. akj=1/ajkand akj, ajk>0, aii=1, ajj=1, the equality in (6) can be further simplified to:(7)n+∑k>jakjaikaij+ajkaijaik=n2(8)⇒∑k>jakjaikaij+ajkaijaik=n2-nSimilar to if x>0, thenx+1x⩾2,we can getakjaikaij+ajkaijaik=akjaikaij+1akjaikaij⩾2. Since there are n(n−1)/2 terms of sum at the left-hand side of the equality (8), we have∑k>j(akjaikaij+ajkaijaik)⩾n(n-1)2×2=n2-n, the equality (8) holds with “=” sign if and only if allakjaikaij=1, which is equivalent to aij=aikajk, or aikajkaji=1 for all j and k. However, this result contradicts with earlier assumption that aij≠aikakjfor certain j and k. Therefore, at least one of the equalities in (4) does not hold. Thus, equality (8) holds with “>” sign. This leads to the conclusion that at least one of the elements in the ith row of the induced bias matrix C is greater than 1.□The cijand cji(i≠j) entries in the induced bias matrix (IBM) C satisfy the inequality condition:cij+cji⩾2, in which the equality will hold if and only if aij=aikajk(i.e. cji=cji=1). If cij<1, then cji>1.From Eq. (1), we havecij=1n∑k=1naikakjaji=1n∑k=1naikakj1aijandcji=1n∑k=1najkakiaij=1n∑k=1najkaki1aji, where aik, akj, aij>0. It is obvious thatcij+cji=1n∑k=1naikakj1aij+1n∑k=1najkaki1aji=1n∑k=1naikakjaji+1aikakjaji⩾2, i.e.cij+cji⩾2. Sinceaikakjaji+1aikakjaji⩾2, the equality will hold if and only if aij=aikajkor aikajkaji=1 (i.e. cji=cji=1). If cij<1, then2-cji⩽cij<1and we can find cji>1. Namely, at least one bias value between cijand cjiis bigger than 1 if aijis inconsistent.□Based on the inverse negative proposition in the Theorem of HPIBM and the Eq. (10) in next section, we can derive that the arithmetic mean of aikakjis greater than aij, which corresponds to the element cijwith the value greater than 1. Therefore, the element cijwith the largest value in matrix C indicates that the corresponding arithmetic mean of aikakjis far greater than aijand aijis too small. Consequently, we can identify the most inconsistent element in matrix A by observing the largest value deviating from 1 in the induced bias matrix C. That is, the element aijin matrix A that corresponds to the element cijwith the largest value (>1) in matrix C is regarded as the most inconsistent element.Note that we have assumed cij>1 is the largest value among all biases in matrix C. Sincecij=1n∑k=1naikakjajiandcji=1n∑k=1najkakiaijdo not satisfy the reciprocal condition and cij is always positive (i.e. cij>0 because aik, akjand akjare positive), the bias value (0<cij<1) of the ratio between the arithmetic means aikakjand aijare not obvious (or less detectable) if we use cij<1 to search for the most inconsistent entry of matrix A. Further, based on the property of HPIBM, if cij<1, (implying cji>1), then we can search for the most inconsistent entry of matrix A by considering cji>1, as long as cjiis the largest bias value in matrix C. In short, either cij>1 or cji>1 is used to identify the largest bias entry whose value is bigger than 1 in matrix C. This is a sensible approach as Harker (1987) and Saaty (1980, 1994, 2003) (discussed in Section 2.1) have also labeled the largest absolute value(s) in their model as the most inconsistent element. Details of the proposed inconsistency identification process are given next.From the above inverse negative proposition, we know that if a matrix is inconsistent, at least one element in each row (or column) would be greater than 1 in matrix C. Assume it is the element in row i and column j, i.e. cij, then we have:(9)cij=1n∑k=1naikakjaji=1n∑k=1naikakj1aij>1(10)⇒ãij=1n∑k=1naikakj>aijEq. (10) shows that the arithmetic mean of the aikakjfor k=1,…,n, denoted asãij, is larger than aij, indicating that aijis smaller thanãij. Thus, when the induced bias element cijin matrix C is larger than 1, the corresponding element aijin matrix A is smaller than it should be. Among them, the element aijin matrix A corresponding to the largest cijis identified as the most inconsistent element in the matrix. This subsequently suggests that the value of aijshould be increased.In summary, the HPIBM inconsistency identification processes include two steps:Step 1: Construct the Hadmard product induced bias matrixC=1nAA∘AT.Step 2: Identify the element with the largest value,cijmax, that deviates from 1 in matrix C. The corresponding aijin matrix A is regarded as the most inconsistent element, which will be adjusted according to the method proposed next.After identifying the inconsistent elements through the two steps proposed above, we now focus on modifying the inconsistent components. There are two methods that can be used to adjust the inconsistent elements: (1) ask the decision makers to revise their judgments; (2) provide a directive to estimate the best values for the inconsistent elements. The former is often time-consuming, costly, and delays the decision making process with no assurance of improvement; while the latter is more efficient. In the following, we derive a formula to recommend the most appropriate value for the inconsistent element, aij, in matrix A.We first analyzecijmaxin the induced bias matrix C. By Eq. (10), we know thatãij=1n∑k=1naikakj>aij, and aijis regarded as the most inconsistent element, we have aij≠aikakjfor certain k. By Eq. (9), we haveãij=aijcij=1n∑k=1naikakj, which is the arithmetic mean of n numbers of the indirect judgment aikakjand we could adapt it to determine the proper value for aij. According to Siraj (2011), the geometric meanãij=(∏kaikakj)n-2and the arithmetic meanãij=1n-2∑k=1naikakjare useful for computing the best value to replace the inconsistent element, where i≠k≠j. In addition, Siraj et al. (2012) define thatγij=1n-2∑k=1n(log(aij)-log(aikakj))is the mean logarithmic deviation to measure the level of inconsistency, where i≠k≠j. Both these articles remove k=i, j from∑k=1naikakjand∑k=1n(log(aij)-log(aikakj)). They only consider the arithmetic mean of the remaining n−2 values. Therefore, we believe that our computation should not contain the two elements of k=i, j either.We have previously identified aijas the most inconsistent element in matrix A, and the formulaãij=aijcij=1n∑k=1naikakjcontains the inconsistent value of aijtwice when k=i, j (i.e., aiiaij=aijand aijajj=aijsince aii=1, ajj=1). This may cause the estimated value of aijto be less than what it should be, since the identified inconsistent element aijis less than the arithmetic mean of aikakj(see Eq. (10)). Therefore, we should remove the inconsistent values of aijfrom the arithmetic meanãij=1n∑k=1naikakj, and use the arithmetic mean of the remaining n−2 numbers in aikakj, i.e.ãij=1n-2∑k=1k≠i,jnaikakj, as the proposed revision for aij. The main difference between the two expressions,1n-2∑k=1k≠i,jnaikakjand1n∑k=1naikakj, is that the former does not contain the inconsistent value of aijtwice when k=i, j, while the latter includes that twice. From the theoretical point of view, the former expression is more accurate than the latter one since we assume the aijis the most inconsistent element, and it should be excluded from the estimated formula. In the proposed model, the formula1n-2∑k=1k≠i,jnaikakjis equivalent to the formulancij-2n-2aijbecause,(11)cij=1n∑k=1naikakjaji=1n∑k=1naikakj1aij=1aij1n∑k=1naikakj(12)⇒naijcij=∑k=1naikakj=∑k=1k≠i,jnaikakj+2aij(13)⇒∑k=1k≠i,jnaikakj=naijcij-2aij(14)⇒ãij=1n-2∑k=1k≠i,jnaikakj=naijcij-2aijn-2=ncij-2n-2aijThe inconsistency adjustment method can be summarized as:Step 1: Use eq. (14) to estimate the most appropriate value for the identified inconsistent element. If the estimated value is larger than the maximum value 9 in Saaty’s 9-point scale, then let it be 9.Step 2: Replace the inconsistent element and its reciprocal with the estimated value and its reciprocal; and test the consistency of the revised matrix A. If the revised matrix fails the consistency test due to severe inconsistency in other element, then select the second largest inconsistent value in matrix C and go to Step 1 above.In the following, we use the example employed by Kwiesielewicz and van Uden (2004) to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed HPIBM model. It is a slightly inconsistent pairwise comparison matrix A8×8 with CR=0.1055>0.1 as shown below:A=121/221/221/221/21411/411/4121/41414141/211/411/411/41241414141/211/411/411/41241414141/211/411/411/41According to the proposed HPIBM model, we have:Step I: Identifying the Inconsistency(Ia)The HPIBMC=1nAA∘ATisC=1.00000.88282.87501.00001.00001.000001.000001.00002.87501.00000.29692.87502.87502.87502.87502.87500.882812.25001.00000.88280.88280.88280.88280.88281.00000.88282.87501.00001.00001.00001.00001.00001.00000.88282.87501.00001.00001.00001.00001.00001.00000.88282.87501.00001.00001.00001.00001.00001.00000.88282.87501.00001.00001.00001.00001.00001.00000.88282.87501.00001.00001.00001.00001.0000Find the value in matrix C that deviates from 1 the most. It iscijmax=c32max=12.25, the most inconsistent element. From Eqs. (9) and (10), we know that a32 is smaller than its average values. Go to Step II to estimate the proper value for a32.Step II: Adjusting the Inconsistency(IIa)Estimate the most appropriate value for a32 using Eq. (14)a32′=nc32-2n-2a32=8×12.25-28-2×14=4Replace the inconsistent elements a32 and a23 with the recommended values of 4 and 1/4. The revised matrix passed the consistency test with CR=0<0.1.The most inconsistent element identified and its estimated optimal values are the same as those found in Kwiesielewicz and van Uden (2004). More preferably, our method is easier and the estimation process is much more transparent than their model. A more sophisticated example on concurrently identifying multiple inconsistent values is given in the e-companion, Section EC.2.We have hitherto applied the Hadamard product approach to induce a bias matrix to identify the cardinal inconsistency and to improve the consistency ratio. In the following, we shall address the ordinal inconsistency issue in the PCM by the HPIBM.Let Ai(i=1,2,…,j,…,k,…,n) be a decision element, and aijbe the cardinal relationship of elements Aiand Aj. Then an ordinal inconsistency indicates that (i) Ai⩾Aj(aij⩾1) and Aj⩾Ak(ajk⩾1), but Ai<Ak(aik<1); or (ii) Ai⩽Aj(aij⩽1), and Aj⩽Ak(ajk⩽1), but Ai>Ak(aik>1).The ordinal inconsistency or intransitivity can be expressed as one of the following three forms:(1)Cardinal Judgment Form: aij⩾1, ajk⩾1 but aik<1; or aij⩽1, ajk⩽1, but aik>1.Directed graph: Ai|→Aj|→Ak→Ai, where the symbol “→” indicates “one is preferred to the other”, “|” represent “equal to the other”, while “|→” denotes “one is preferred to or equal to the other”Three-way cycle (also known as circular triad or intransitive judgments).Possible cases of intransitive judgments defined above can be vividly represented by three-way cycles, as shown in Fig. 1.Graph ① in Fig. 1 shows that Aiis preferred to Aj, and Ajis preferred to Ak, but Akis preferred to Aiinstead of Aiis preferred to Ak. This three-way cycle corresponds to the case of aij>1, ajk>1 but aik<1 (aik=1/aki) in the cardinal inconsistent judgment form, and the case of Ai→Aj→Ak→Aiin the directed graph form. Graph ② suggests that Aiis preferred to Aj, and Ajis preferred to Ak, but Akand Aiare equally preferred, which corresponds to the case of ajk>1, aki=1 but aji<1 (aji=1/aij) in the cardinal inconsistent judgment form, and the case of Aj→Ak|Ai→Aiin the directed graph form. Likewise, Graph ③ shows that Aiand Akare equally preferred, Akand Ajare equally preferred, but Aiis more preferred to Aj. This three-way cycle corresponds to the case of ajk=1, aki=1 but aji<1 (aji=1/aij) in the cardinal inconsistent judgment form, and the case of Aj|Ak|Ai→Aiin the directed graph form.Graphs ④ to ⑥ are the inverse cases of graphs ① to ③. Obviously, the four types of intransitive judgments except graphs ① and ④, are caused by equal preference. We found that the following transformation formula can be used to eliminate the intransitive judgments caused by equal preference while retaining much of the original judgment in matrix A:(15)aij=1.01,ifaij=1andi<j0.99,ifaij=1andi>jaijotherwiseIn summary, if there exist three comparison elements Ai, Ajand Ak, which make up a triangular graph, then the judgments of these three elements will become ordinal inconsistent if the triangular graph formed by these elements resembles any of the graphs in Fig. 1.We now propose a simple method to identify the ordinal inconsistency by combining the directed graph theory and the principle of the HPIBM model. Fig. 1 shows that at least three elements are needed to detect the ordinal inconsistency in matrix A. This implies that intransitive judgments may take place after a third element is introduced to compare with the other two elements. Based on HPIBM, we can determine the relationship of Aiand Ajwith the other n−2 elements in the matrix, by multiplying matrixA=(aij)n×nwith itself, denoted as matrix O:(16)O=(oij)n×n=AAFor any element in O, we have(17)oij=∑k=1naikakj=∑k=1≠i,jnaikakj+aiiaij+aijajjThe first (n−2) terms in (17) indicate the ordinal and cardinal relationships between Aiand Ak; and then between Akand Aj, where k≠i or j. It also indirectly shows the possible value of aijif the three elements satisfy the perfectly consistent condition aij=aikakj. For instance, when k=1, ai1 denotes how much Aiis preferred to A1, and a1jshows how much A1 is preferred to Aj. Based on graph theory and Fig. 1, we know that the judgment between (Aiand Ak), and again between (Akand Aj) can be transformed and described by directed edges.To detect whether there exists intransitive judgment (ordinal inconsistency) among Ai, Aj, and the other (n−2) elements, the preference of Aiand Ajshould be determined, i.e. the edge between Aiand Ajshould be connected and compared with Fig. 1. Based on the reciprocal condition of matrix A, aij=1/aji, the perfect cardinal consistent condition aij=aikakjcan be easily denoted as aikakjaji=1. Therefore, Eq. (17) can be transformed to Eq. (18) by multiplying ajito both sides of Eq. (17). The revised Eq. (18) happens to take after the HPIBM model for cardinal inconsistency as seen in Eq. (1):(18)Ciji=oij×aji=∑k=1naikakjaji=∑k=1≠i,jnaikakjaji+aiiaijaji+aijajjajiThus, the corresponding ordinal preference relations of the first (n−2) terms in (18) can be represented as triangular groups, as shown in Fig. 2.After introducing the third element ajito (17), the relations among Ai, Aj, and the (n−2) Akelements can be distinctly expressed in (18), and displayed vividly as triangular groups in Fig. 2. Once the ordinal preference relationships are determined by the cardinal relationship, all edges can be replaced by directed edges (or undirected edges) to detect whether there exist ordinal inconsistencies. Specifically, to judge whether there exists an intransitive judgment among Ai, A1 and Aj, we only need to connect Aiand Ajby directed or undirected edges, denoted as ①, ② or ③ in Fig. 2(b). According to Fig. 1, if the ordinal preference relation between Aiand Ajbelongs to ② or ③ in Fig. 2(b), then there exists an ordinal inconsistency in this triangular preference relation.To summarize the ordinal preference information discussed above so as to detect the intransitive judgments numerically, we develop a binary Boolean matrix B=[bij] to reflect the preference relationship based on the original information in matrix A. We define(19)bij=1,ifaij⩾1andi≠j0otherwiseReplacing matrix A with Boolean matrix B in Eq. (19), we convert Eqs. (18)–(20):(20)Ciji=∑k=1nbikbkjbji=∑k=1≠i,jnbikbkjbji+biibijbji+bijbjjbjiSince bii=0 and bjj=0 when i=j, Eq. (20) not only reflects the triad cycles of the (n−2) triangular groups as shown in Fig. 3, but also computes the total number of three-way cycles (intransitive judgments). Specifically, if all elements in (aik,akj,aji) group are ⩾1, then the corresponding bikbkjbji=1 or bkibijbjk=1. Therefore, the three-way cycles and their numbers can be detected and tallied by Eq. (20). Take the triad elements A1, A2 and A3 as examples, the possible intransitive judgments and their triangular (three-way cycles) graphs are shown in graphs ①–③ and ⑤–⑦ of Fig. 3. The product of the three elements in each of the three-way cycles is equal to 1, which indicates that there exists an intransitive judgment.However, when the three elements are equally preferred the product of the above cases still suggests that there exists intransitive judgment and cannot reflect the real judgment, as shown in graphs ④ and ⑧ in Fig. 3. To avoid such mistakes, we apply (15), i.e., when i<j, we replace aij=1 with aij=1.01; and when i>j we replace aij=1 with aij=0.99, both of which borders on the value of 1. Thus, we reduce the six intransitive cases in Fig. 3 to two simple cases, graphs ① and ⑤ in Fig. 3.To reflect the possible cases of graphs ④ and ⑧ in Fig. 3 more precisely, a symbol “e” is introduced to represent the equal preference between Aiand Aj. When aij=1 (i≠j), Eq. (20) can be further transformed to(21)bij=1,ifaij>1eifaij=1andi≠j0otherwiseThus, the three-way cycles with equal preference relations in Fig. 3 can be reflected by e, e2 or e3, which correspond to one-, two-, or three equal edges in the three-way cycle, as shown in Fig. 4. Since graphs ② and ⑥ (b13b32b21=e and b31b12b23=e), ③ and ⑦ (b13b32b21=e2 and b31b12b23=e2) in Fig. 4 show that there exists an intransitive judgment, we define that e=1, e2=1. On the other hand, there exist three equal edges in graphs ④ and ⑧, which are not intransitive as the three elements are equally preferred, we therefore define e3=0 so as to remove this misidentification by Eq. (20). Through such definition, we are able to distinguish tied judgments, by using “e” for one undirected (equal) edge, “e2” for two undirected edges, and “e3” for three undirected edges in a three-way cycle. As a result, the total number of intransitive judgments can be accurately computed through such definition and Eq. (23) (to be discussed in Section 4.4).If there exists a three-way cycle (circular triad; intransitive judgments) in the pairwise comparison matrix A, then the HPIBM (matrix Co) derived from Boolean matrix B is not a zero matrix, and the HPIBM for ordinal inconsistency can be defined as:(22)CO=BB∘BT=(cijo)=∑k=1nbikbkjbji,wherecijo=∑k=1nbikbkjbjiIn short, the HPIBM model for identifying the ordinal inconsistency includes the following two steps:Step I: Identifying the three-way cycles(Ia)Establish preference matrix B=[bij] by Eq. (21).Construct induced bias matrix C (denoted as Co) for ordinal preference by Eq. (22).Compute the number of cycles by Eq. (23):(23)N=13∑i=1n∑j=1ncijo,wheree=1,e2=1,e3=0Note: By Eqs. (21) and (22), if aij=1 and i≠j, thencijocontains e, e2 or e3, where e=1, e2=1 and e3=1, as shown in Fig. 4 and explained previously.Identify the intransitive judgments by applying any of the following methods:Find the corresponding row and column numbers of the non-zero elements in the upper (or lower) diagonal triangular matrix of matrix Coto identify the three-way cycles.Draw the directed graph of the non-zero elements in the induced bias matrix Co.Record the coordinates of non-zero elements in matrix Co, and then locate the intransitive judgments by triad combination with head–tail connection principle. Specifically, in matrix A if the column of the 1st element equals the row of the 2nd element, the column of the 2nd element equals the row of the 3rd element, and the column of the 3rd element equals the row of the 1st element, then, a circular cycle can be formed. Assume the elements in matrix A corresponding to the non-zero elements in matrix C are aik, akj, and aji, then a three-way cycle can be formed by head–tail connection principle as follows:The above three methods will be illustrated by Example 1 in Section 4.5, in which methods (ii) and (iii) may be difficult for decision makers who are not OR experts, but they are useful and helpful to design an interactive and visualized user interface by graph to identify and eliminate the “three cycles” in a decision support system. Such graphic user interface might be the best way to aid non-OR expert to easily understand the ordinal inconsistency and make adjustment.Step II: Eliminate the three-way cycles(IIa)Construct the induced bias matrix C by HPIBM for cardinal inconsistency, using Eq. (1).Identify the largest value in matrix C and find the corresponding non-zero element with the largest value in matrix COand define it ascijo.Adjust all non-zero elements in row i and column j in COto eliminate the three-way cycles through Eq. (14).To illustrate the proposed HPIBM for ordinal inconsistency identification, we make use of the Example 1 in Siraj et al. (2012):The PCM above has a consistency ratio of 0.083, which passes the cardinal consistency test. To check whether there exists ordinal inconsistency (intransitive judgment), we apply the proposed HPIBM model to the above PCM and detail the HPIBM-based ordinal inconsistency identification process below.Step I: Identify the three-way cycles(Ia)Establish preference Boolean matrix B using Eq. (21)B=0101100011110000010000110Construct HPIBM COusing Eq. (22)CO=BB∘BT=0020000200000221100011000Compute the number of cycles with Eq. (23) using the total number of intransitivity found in CoN=(2+2+2+2+1+1+1+1)/3=12/3=4Identify the intransitive judgments by using any of the aforementioned three methods.(i)Identify coordinates of non-zero elements. Since the number of three-way cycles is 4, and the non-zero elements in the upper diagonal triangular matrix are (c13o=2,c23o=2) and (c34o=2,c35O=2), either pair can be used to identify the three-way cycles. Similarly, the four non-zero elements (c41O=1,c42O=1,c51O=1andc52O=1) in the lower half-matrix can also be used to identify the four intransitive judgments. In the following, the pairs (c13O=2,c23O=2) are used as an example to illustrate the details of the three-way cycle identification. By Eq. (22) and matrix B, we can easily obtain that,c13o=2=∑k=15b1kbk3b31=b11b13b31+b12b23b31+b13b33b31+b14b43b31+b15b53b31=0+0+0+1+1=b14b43b31+b15b53b31Thus, b14b43b31=1 and b15b53b31=1, which corresponds to the elements (a14=5/2>1, a43=4/3>1, a31=4/3>1) and (a15=7/4>1, a53=4/3>1, a31=4/3>1) in matrix A, respectively. Therefore, the cycles a14a43a31 and a15a53a31 are identified as the intransitive judgments. Likewise, we findc23o=2=∑k=15b2kbk3b32=b21b13b32+b22b23b32+b23b33b32+b24b43b32+b25b53b32=b24b43b32+b25b53b32The intransitive judgments are a24a43a32 and a25a53a32. If one applies the above approach toc34O=2andc35O=2;c41O=1andc42O=1; andc51)=1andc52O=1, then the same four three-way cycles can be identified.Draw the directed graph of the non-zero elements in CO. From the non-zero elements of matrix CO, we derive Fig. 5. Sincec13O=2,c23O=2,c34O=2, andc35O=2are in matrix CO, each of the directed edges such as A3A1, A3A2, A4A3, A5A3 is included in the three-way cycles twice. Therefore, Fig. 5 can be decomposed into four graphs, each of which shares one common edge between the two three-way cycles, as shown in Fig. 6(a)–(d). For example, in Fig. 6(a), the edge A3A1 is shared by two three-way cycles, A3A1A4A3 and A3A1A5A3, respectively. Therefore, the identified three-way cycles are A3→A1→A4→A3; A3→A1→A5→A3; A3→A2→A4→A3; A3→A2→A5→A3.Apply the Triad combination method. We use the non-zero elements in COto locate the three-way cycle through head–tail connection principle. In matrix CO, the non-zero elements include:c13O,c23O,c34O,c35O,c41O,c42O,c51O,c52O, by Eqs. (22) and (21), their corresponding elements in judgment matrix B and matrix A are b31, b32, b43, b53, b14, b24, b15, b25 and a31, a32, a43, a53, a14, a24, a15, a25, respectively. Since we have estimated that there are four three-way cycles in matrix A, andc13O=2,c23O=2,c34O=2andc35O=2in matrix Co, corresponding to a31,a32, a43 and a53 in matrix A, we can start the triad combination by the head–tail connection principle from the pairs of (a31, a32) and (a43, a53) respectively. Recall thatc13Oin matrix C corresponds to b31 in matrix B and a31 in matrix A. The four results are shown below.Obviously, each graph in Fig. 7contains two three-way cycles, and the four three-way cycles in Fig. 7 (a) and (b) are the same as those in Fig. 7 (c) and (d). They are: A3→A1→A4→A3; A3→A1→A5→A3; A3→A2→A4→A3; A3→A2→A5→A3.In short, the three-way cycles identified by the above three methods are identical and the results are the same as those found in Siraj et al. (2012). Note that methods (ii) and (iii) are useful when graphical exhibition is needed to provide intuitive visual interpretation.Step II: Eliminate the three-way cyclesOnce the three-way cycles are identified, they should be eliminated so as to correct the intransitive judgments and form a consistent PCM. For simplicity, we can eradicate the three-way cycles by employing Eq. (14) to determine the proper values for (a31 and a32) or (a43 and a53), since we have identified that each pair contains four three-way cycles. How to select the most effective elements between (a31 and a32) and (a43 and a53), in order to eliminate the transitivity becomes an important issue. In the following, we fully utilize the original data information in matrix A to eliminate the detected three-way cycles by applying the HPIBM method.(IIa)Construct HPIBM C for cardinal inconsistency using Eq. (1):C=15AA∘AT=10.73022.26110.98401.09291.515012.11430.89700.66390.62360.850012.40891.94721.59441.64000.620011.26401.33511.97000.83430.82861The largest value in matrix C, 2.4089, corresponds to the non-zero elementc34O=2in matrix Co. To eliminate the four three-way cycles all at once, we follow the next step to estimate the optimal values for a34 and a35, as a35 is in the same row with a34.Estimate the values of ordinal inconsistent elements by using Eq. (14):ã34=5c34-25-2a34=5×2.4089-25-2×34=2.5111ã35=5c35-25-2a35=5×1.9472-25-2×34=1.934By applying the estimated values and their reciprocals to the original judgment matrix A, we can reverse the edges and eliminate the three-way cycles. In addition, the HPIBM method can improve the value of CR from 0.083 to 0.0164, which is smaller than the 0.055 achieved by the heuristic approach in Siraj et al. (2012). Besides using the estimated values that contain decimal numbers, one also can choose the approximated integer number that is closest to Saaty’s 9-point integer scale to improve the consistency ratio. For instance, letã34=2.5111≈3,ã35=1.934≈2, then apply these approximated integer values and their reciprocals to the original matrix, we still can improve the value of CR from 0.083 to 0.0148. Note that the rounding of the modified values (ãij) (and their reciprocal ones) to the integer values of Saaty’s fundamental scale is not necessary from the theoretical point of view, if this approximation is done based on the decision makers’ preference.Note that the induced bias values for c13 in above matrix C is 2.2611, while that for c23 is 2.1143. They are close to the largest value, 2.4089. Therefore, their corresponding values, a13 and a23, in matrix A can be estimated by Eq. (14) and above matrix C; their edges are reversed, and the three-way cycles are eliminated. Through Eq. (14), we find the estimated a13 is 2.3268, and a23 is 2.1429. The solution can also improve the CR from 0.055 by Siraj et al. (2012) to 0.0173, which is only slightly larger than 0.0164.In our example, the proposed HPIBM method not only identifies all edges partaking in the three-way cycles, but also recommends the best values for the identified intransitive elements so as to eliminate the intransitive judgment (three-way cycles). The HPIBM model more significantly improves the value of CR than the methods of inverting the original values or changing the original values to 0.99.Interested readers are referred to the e-companion (Section EC.3) for detailed illustration of another case involving more sophisticated equal-preference ordinal inconsistency.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Much attention has been given to the study of the cardinal and ordinal inconsistencies of the decision matrix and pairwise comparison matrix (PCM), and the attempts hitherto have encountered variable degrees of success. However, most methods can only deal with one type of inconsistency, and they are extremely dependent on the methods used to derive the priority vectors. In particular, they are complicated and difficult to implement in practice. In this paper, we develop a Hadamard product induced bias matrix (HPIBM) to identify the most inconsistent elements in a PCM and to improve the consistency ratio. We introduce a formula to estimate the best value to replace the most inconsistent element. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed HPIBM, and the results show that the proposed model is simpler and easier than the existing methods.Since a matrix with acceptable consistency ratio may be ordinal inconsistent (Siraj et al., 2012), we further explore and adapt the HPIBM to address the ordinal inconsistency issue. We validate our approach by graph theory and provide numerical examples to identify and eliminate the ordinal inconsistencies, i.e., the three-way cycles. Through the proposed HPIBM for ordinal inconsistency, we can readily determine the number of three-way cycles that are present in a PCM. The three-way cycles can be detected by applying any of three methods: coordinates identification, directed graph, and the Triad head–tail connection principle.Through numerical examples, we find that the consistency ratios can be greatly improved by using HPIBM for cardinal inconsistency rather than the prevalent heuristic approaches, e.g., Siraj et al. (2012). In addition, the intransitive judgments in a PCM can also vividly be identified and improved by the HPIBM for ordinal inconsistency method. In summary, the proposed HPIBM is not only independent of priority weights but is also easier and simpler to implement than existing models. Above all, it can be used for identification and adjustment of both cardinal and ordinal inconsistencies.
