@&#ABSTRACT@&#
For the problem of multi-target tracking, utilization of Doppler information can greatly improve the tracking performance. However, the presence of Doppler blind zone (DBZ) strongly deteriorates the performance. To overcome this problem, we first employ a well-known detection probability model with incorporating the minimum detectable velocity (MDV), which determines the width of the DBZ. Then, by substituting the resulting detection probability into the update equation of the standard Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter, we derive the update expression for a novel GM-PHD filter where the MDV and Doppler information are fully exploited. Moreover, we present an approximate filter with detailed implementation steps to reduce the amount of calculation without a significant degradation in performance. It is demonstrated through numerical examples that the proposed approach outperforms the existing GM-PHD filter which doesn't incorporate the MDV or Doppler information. Particularly, it has significantly better performance at small MDV value.Main abbreviationsDBZDoppler blind zoneMDVMinimum detectable velocityGMGaussian mixtureMTTMulti-target trackingGMTIGround moving target indicationPFParticle filterIMMInteracting multiple modelPHDProbability hypothesis densityMD(s)Missed detection(s)CPHDCardinalized PHD

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In multi-target tracking (MTT), it is well-known that utilization of the Doppler information can greatly improve the tracking performance [1]. However, the existence of Doppler blind zone (DBZ) is a main challenge [2], especially for ground moving target indication (GMTI) radars. The DBZ arises from the clutter cancellation to separate moving target returns from the clutter background. Hence, low-Doppler targets, whose Doppler magnitude falls below the minimum detectable velocity (MDV), can easily be masked by such a blind zone. This results in a series of missed detections (MDs) that significantly deteriorate the tracking performance [3]. The MDV determines the width of the DBZ and is an important parameter for target tracking. A general MDV expression was derived based on numerous assumptions in [4]. For the case of monostatic sideways-looking radars, the MDV is known to be a constant parameter. However, it is not constant anymore in a bistatic configuration. A monostatic radar stands for a radar with a single antenna which both transmits and receives signals, while the bistatic configuration consists of spatially separated transmit and receive units [5–7].To track a single target in the presence of the DBZ, a natural choice is exploiting the particle filter (PF), as the hard constraint on the nonlinear measurement space can be easily incorporated into this framework [8,9]. An interacting multiple model (IMM) PF was proposed in [10] to track a maneuvering target hidden in the DBZ. In order to reduce computational demand of the PF, an analytic approach for tracking under blind Doppler constraints was presented in [11–13], which is based on Gaussian mixture (GM) approximations of the conditional density of a target state.Another GM tracking algorithm, close in spirit to that in [11–13], was proposed in [2,3,14,15], which introduced a fictitious measurement to represent a missed detection (MD), by constructing a suitable state-dependent detection probability which takes low values inside the DBZ. This approach has many extensions. In [16], the algorithm was applied to track targets masked by both the DBZ and terrain obstacles. Furthermore, a method to exploit group information, road map, and Doppler blindness information for convoy tracking was proposed in [17]. In [18], the algorithm in [3] was extended to GMTI tracking in a medium pulse repetition frequency mode, in which both Doppler and range ambiguities occurred.Rather than attributing MDs to the measurement model as performed in [3], some approaches modify the target model to account for them. In [19], a variable structure IMM estimator with an additional “stopped” model was adopted to solve this problem. The stopped model was added to the mode set when the state entered the DBZ and removed upon the state outside the DBZ. Since a target cannot switch to the stopped model from a high speed in a real scenario, an approach was developed by using state-dependent mode transition probabilities in [20].For more complicate environment involving tracking multiple targets in clutter, a “two-dummy” assignment approach was proposed in [21], where one dummy measurement represented the conventional MD due to sensors' imperfect detection ability and another extra dummy measurement represented the additional MD caused by the DBZ. Based on the 2-dimensional (2D) assignment, a track segment association approach was developed in [22,23] to resolve the broken track problem resulting from the DBZ. This approach with state-dependent mode transition probabilities in [20] was proposed in [24]. A Markov chain two (MC2) model, including three target states (the target may not exist, or it may exist and be detectable with probability of detection, or it may exist and be not temporarily detectable), was incorporated into the integrated track splitting (ITS) framework to handle multiple masked targets in [25]. Based on the multiple-model multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT), a solution to tracking multi-target in the DBZ was presented in [26], and a MHT filter augmented by the DBZ and road information was applied to experimental data under realistic conditions in [27].However, the above MTT algorithms involve explicit associations between measurements and targets, where computational load of data association is heavy due to its combinatorial nature. Recently, as a promising alternative approach to traditional association-based methods, the random finite set (RFS)-based approaches for multi-target tracking have gained substantial research interest. Among those approaches, the probability hypothesis density (PHD) and cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter have the distinct advantage that they operate only on the single-target state space and avoid complicated data association. There have been two main implementations for the PHD/CPHD. One is based on sequential Monte Carlo [28] and the other is based on the GM [29]. By modeling the effect of Doppler blindness with a target state-dependent detection probability as [3], the GM-PHD filter was applied to the GMTI tracking in the DBZ in [30,31], while the GM-CPHD filter was applied to the GMTI tracking in the DBZ in [32,33], respectively. However, these references did not provide the rigorous derivation or detailed implementation. Moreover, they only utilized the MDV knowledge while ignored the Doppler information. In [34,35], the problem of multi-target tracking with only Doppler measurements in a passive multi-static scenario was addressed, but the DBZ was not involved.This paper is concentrated on the MTT problem in the DBZ based on the GM-PHD. First, the detection probability model with incorporating the MDV is reviewed. Then, by substituting the resulting detection probability into the update equation of the standard GM-PHD, the novel GM-PHD update with incorporating the MDV and Doppler information is rigorously derived. Finally, to reduce the computational load, an approximate filter with detailed implementation steps is proposed.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the MTT problem under the RFS framework. In Section 3, the novel GM-PHD filter with the Doppler and MDV is addressed. Numerical studies are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.Consider a multi-target tracking scenario. LetNk−1be the number of targets, and their states are{xk−1,1,xk−1,2,…,xk−1,Nk−1}∈Xat timek−1. At the next time, previous targets may die or continue to survive and new targets may appear or spawn from surviving targets. This results inNkstates{xk,1,xk,2,…,xk,Nk}. Suppose that there areMkmeasurements{zk,1,zk,2,…,zk,Mk}∈Zreceived by a sensor at time k. Only some of these measurements are originated from targets, and they are indistinguishable from false measurements. Note that there is no ordering on the respective collections of target states and measurements at time k, so they can be naturally represented as finite sets, i.e.,(1)Xk={xk,1,xk,2,…,xk,Nk}∈F(X)(2)Zk={zk,1,zk,2,…,zk,Mk}∈F(Z)whereF(X)andF(Z)are the collections of all finite subsets ofXandZ, respectively.Given a multiple-target stateXk−1at timek−1, the multiple-target stateXkat time k is given by the union of the spontaneous births, spawned targets, and surviving targets(3)Xk=Γk∪[⋃x∈Xk−1Bk|k−1(x)]∪[⋃x∈Xk−1Sk|k−1(x)]whereΓkandBk|k−1(x)represent the RFS of spontaneous birth and targets spawned from a target with previous statex∈Xk−1at time k, respectively. The actual forms ofΓkandBk|k−1(⋅)are problem-dependent.Sk|k−1(x)is the survival target RFS at time k based onx∈Xk−1, which can take on either{xk,i}(when the target survives) or ∅ (when the target dies). Eachx∈Xk−1either continues to exist with probabilitypS,k(x)or dies with probability1−pS,k(x). If the target survives, the probability density function (PDF) of a transition from statexk−1toxkis(4)fk|k−1(xk|xk−1)=N(xk;Fk−1xk−1,Qk−1)whereN(⋅;m,P)denotes a Gaussian density with meanmand covarianceP,Fk−1is the state transition matrix, andQk−1is the process noise covariance.The survival probability is state-independent, given by(5)pS,k(x)=pS,kGiven a multiple-target stateXk, the multiple-target measurementZkreceived at a sensor is formed by the union of clutter and target generated measurements(6)Zk=Kk∪[⋃x∈XkΘk(x)]whereKkis the clutter RFS and its actual form is problem-dependent,Θk(x)is the RFS of the detected target-originated measurements, which can take on eitherzk,j(when the target is detected with the state-dependent detection probabilitypD,k(x)) or ∅ (when the target is missed with probability1−pD,k(x)). Conditioned on detection, the PDF of obtaining an observationzfromxis given by(7)gk(z|x)=N(z;Hkx,Rk)whereHkis the observation matrix andRkis the observation noise covariance.Letxk=[xkykzkx˙ky˙kz˙k]Tdenote a state at time k in a common reference coordinate, where (xk,yk,zk) denotes the position component and (x˙k,y˙k,z˙k) is the velocity component. Similarly, letxks=[xksykszksx˙ksy˙ksz˙ks]Tdenote the sensor state. The Doppler expression is given by(8)r˙k=hd(xk)=(xk−xks)(x˙k−x˙ks)+(yk−yks)(y˙k−y˙ks)+(zk−zks)(z˙k−z˙ks)(xk−xks)2+(yk−yks)2+(zk−zks)2and the clutter Dopplerr˙c,kof the corresponding background at the position of statexkis given by(9)r˙c,k=−x˙ks(xk−xks)+y˙ks(yk−yks)+z˙ks(zk−zks)(xk−xks)2+(yk−yks)2+(zk−zks)2where it is assumed that the clutter is static.From [33], the difference ofr˙kandr˙c,kis called the clutter notch (see [3] for details), defined by(10)nc=nc(xk)=r˙k−r˙c,k=x˙k(xk−xks)+y˙k(yk−yks)+z˙k(zk−zks)(xk−xks)2+(yk−yks)2+(zk−zks)2The clutter notch not only suppresses clutter, it also influences the low-Doppler target detection. In general, the detection probabilitypD,k(x), which is a function of the target state, is strongly influenced by the DBZ. Specifically,pD,k(x)drops to zero whenncfalls below the MDV, i.e.,|nc|<MDV, andpD,k(x)approaches the saturated valuepDwhenncis far from the clutter notch, i.e.,|nc|≫MDV. To this end, following the approach in [3,33], we can model the detection probability as(11)pD,k(x)≈pD[1−exp⁡(−(nc(x)/MDV)2⋅log⁡2)]wherepDis the conventional detection probability accounting for the directivity pattern and propagation effects of the antenna.To get Gaussian form of the exponential detection probability in (11), which will be deployed conveniently within the GM-PHD framework, expanding the nonlinear clutter notch functionncin Taylor series around the predicted statexˆk|k−1=[xˆk|k−1yˆk|k−1zˆk|k−1x˙ˆk|k−1y˙ˆk|k−1z˙ˆk|k−1]Tup to the first order term yields(12)nc(xk)≈nc(xˆk|k−1)+∂nc∂xk|xk=xˆk|k−1⋅(xk−xˆk|k−1)=nc(xˆk|k−1)−∂nc∂xk|xk=xˆk|k−1⋅xˆk|k−1+∂nc∂xk|xk=xˆk|k−1⋅xk=yf(xˆk|k−1)−Hf(xˆk|k−1)⋅xkwith the fictitious measurement function(13)yf=yf(xˆk|k−1)=nc(xˆk|k−1)+Hf(xˆk|k−1)xˆk|k−1and the corresponding fictitious measurement vector(14)Hf(xˆk|k−1)=−∂nc∂xk|xk=xˆk|k−1=[n1n2n3n4n5n6]Twheren1=−(x˙ˆk|k−1−nˆccos⁡aˆkcos⁡eˆk)/rˆk,n2=−(y˙ˆk|k−1−nˆcsin⁡aˆkcos⁡eˆk)/rˆk,n3=−(z˙ˆk|k−1−nˆcsin⁡eˆk)/rˆk,n4=−cos⁡aˆkcos⁡eˆk,n5=−sin⁡aˆkcos⁡eˆk,n6=−sin⁡eˆk,rˆk≜(xˆk|k−1−xks)2+(yˆk|k−1−yks)2+(zˆk|k−1−zks)2,aˆk≜atan2[(yˆk|k−1−yks),(xˆk|k−1−xks)],eˆk≜arctan⁡[(zˆk|k−1−zks)/(xˆk|k−1−xks)2+(yˆk|k−1−yks)2],nˆc=nc(xˆk|k−1)=x˙ˆk|k−1(xˆk|k−1−xks)+y˙ˆk|k−1(yˆk|k−1−yks)+z˙ˆk|k−1(zˆk|k−1−zks)(xˆk|k−1−xks)2+(yˆk|k−1−yks)2+(zˆk|k−1−zks)2,and “atan2” refers to the four-quadrant inverse tangent function.Substituting the above approximatenc(x)into (11) yields(15)pD,k(x)=pD[1−cf⋅N(yf(xˆk|k−1);Hf(xˆk|k−1)⋅x,Rf)]wherecf=MDV⋅π/log⁡2is a normalization factor andRf=MDV2/(2log⁡2)is the variance of the fictitious measurement in the Doppler domain. Hence, the information on the clutter notch in (10) serves as a fictitious measurement, and the MDV plays the role of the standard deviation for the fictitious measurement.For the PHD filter, the posterior intensityυk(x)can be propagated in time via the following predicted and update steps [29](16)υk|k−1(x)=∫pS,k(ζ)fk|k−1(x|ζ)υk−1(ζ)dζ+∫βk|k−1(x|ζ)υk−1(ζ)dζ+γk(x)(17)υk(x)=[1−pD,k(x)]υk|k−1(x)+∑z∈ZkpD,k(x)gk(z|x)υk|k−1(x)κk(z)+∫pD,k(x)gk(z|x)υk|k−1(x)dxwhereγk(⋅),βk|k−1(x|ζ), andκk(z)denote intensities of the birth RFSΓk, the RFSBk|k−1(ζ)spawned by a target with previous stateζ, and clutter RFSKkat time k, respectively,gk(z|x)is the likelihood function in (7). For Doppler radars,gk(z|x)can be further rewritten as [1](18)gk(z|x)=N(yc;Hc,kx,Rc,k)N(yd;hd(x),σd2)wherezdenotes a conventional measurement including position measurement componentycand Doppler componentyd,Hc,kis the position observation matrix,Rc,kis the position observation noise covariance,hd(⋅)is the nonlinear Doppler measurement function defined in (8), andσdis the Doppler observation noise standard deviation. It is assumed that the position measurement and Doppler measurement are uncorrelated, and the position measurement function is linear. For nonlinear polar measurements, the observation matrixHc,kand the corresponding covarianceRc,kcan be obtained by measurement transformation [36–39].From (16) and (17), it is seen that the detection probability doesn't have an impact on the predicted intensity. It only affects the update intensity. Thus, we focus on the derivation of the update intensity with incorporating the Doppler and MDV information, since the related predicted formula is the same as that of [29]. Before derivation, a lemma is needed.Lemma 1Given H, R, m, and P of appropriate dimensions and that R and P are positive definite, then(19)N(z;Hx,R)N(x;m,P)=N(z;Hm,S)N(x;m+G(z−Hm),P−GSGT)withS=HPHT+RandG=PHTS−1[29].Suppose that the predicted intensity at time k is a GM of the form(20)υk|k−1(x)=∑j=1Jk|k−1wk|k−1(j)N(x;mk|k−1(j),Pk|k−1(j))wherewk|k−1(j),mk|k−1(j)andPk|k−1(j)are the weight, state and covariance of the predicted component j, respectively. Then substituting the likelihood function (18) and detection probability (11) into (17), applying successively the product formula for normal densities inLemma 1, and rearranging the terms yields the following update intensity(21)υk(x)=∑j=1Jk|kwk|k(j)N(x;mk|k(j),Pk|k(j))=∑j=1Jk|k−1wk|k,0(j)N(x;mk|k,0(j),Pk|k,0(j))+∑z∈Zk∑j=1Jk|k−1wk|k(j)(z)N(x;mk|k(j)(z),Pk|k(j)(z))+∑j=1Jk|k−1wk|k,f(j)N(x;mk|k,f(j),Pk|k,f(j))+∑z∈Zk∑j=1Jk|k−1wk|k(j)(zf)N(x;mk|k(j)(zf),Pk|k(j)(zf))wherezfrepresents the augmented measurement including the conventional measurement componentzand fictitious measurement componentyf. Such components as{wk|k,0(j),mk|k,0(j),Pk|k,0(j)},{wk|k(j)(z),mk|k(j)(z),Pk|k(j)(z)},{wk|k,f(j),mk|k,f(j),Pk|k,f(j)}, and{wk|k(j)(zf),mk|k(j)(zf),Pk|k(j)(zf)}are updated by the conventional missed detections, conventional measurements, fictitious measurements, and augmented measurements, respectively.The component{wk|k,0(j),mk|k,0(j),Pk|k,0(j)}is given by(22)wk|k,0(j)=(1−pD)wk|k−1(j)(23)mk|k,0(j)=mk|k−1(j),Pk|k,0(j)=Pk|k−1(j)The component{wk|k(j)(z),mk|k(j)(z),Pk|k(j)(z)}is obtained by sequentially processing the position measurement and Doppler measurement, calculated as(24)wk|k(j)(z)=pDwk|k−1(j)qk(j)(z)κk(z)+wsum(25)mk|k(j)(z)=mk|k(j)(yc)+Gd,k(j)(yc)(yd−hd(mk|k(j)(yc)))(26)Pk|k(j)(z)=[I−Gd,k(j)(yc)Hd(mk|k(j)(yc))]Pk|k(j)(yc)whereκk(z),wsumandqk(j)(z)are given in (45), (46) and (47), respectively,mk|k(j)(z)andPk|k(j)(z)denote the update mean and covariance with measurementz(which includes the position measurementycand Doppler measurementyd), respectively. Similarly,mk|k(j)(yc)andPk|k(j)(yc)represent the update mean and covariance with position measurementyc, respectively, given by(27)mk|k(j)(yc)=mk|k−1(j)+Gc,k(j)(yc−Hc,kmk|k−1(j))(28)Pk|k(j)(yc)=[I−Gc,k(j)Hc,k]Pk|k−1(j)with the gain for the position measurement(29)Gc,k(j)=Pk|k−1(j)Hc,k[Ξc,k(j)]−1and the covariance of the innovation for the position measurement(30)Ξc,k(j)=Hc,kPk|k−1(j)[Hc,k]T+Rc,k.The gainGd,k(j)(yc)in (25) and (26) for the Doppler measurement is obtained by(31)Gd,k(j)(yc)=Pk|k(j)(yc)Hd(mk|k(j)(yc))[Ξd,k(j)(yc)]−1with the variance of the innovation for the Doppler measurement(32)Ξd,k(j)(yc)=Hd(mk|k(j)(yc))Pk|k(j)(yc)[Hd(mk|k(j)(yc))]T+σd2In (26), (31) and (32),Hd(mk|k(j)(yc))is the Jacobian matrix ofr˙kwith respect toxkevaluated atmk|k(j)(yc)=[xˆk|k(j)yˆk|k(j)zˆk|k(j)x˙ˆk|k(j)y˙ˆk|k(j)z˙ˆk|k(j)]T(for each component j), i.e.,(33)Hd(mk|k(j)(yc))=∂r˙k∂xk|xk=mk|k(j)(yc)=[h1(j)h2(j)h3(j)h4(j)h5(j)h6(j)]withh1(j)=[(x˙ˆk|k(j)−x˙ks)−hd(mk|k(j)(yc))cos⁡aˆk(j)cos⁡eˆk(j)]/rˆk(j),h2(j)=[(y˙ˆk|k(j)−y˙ks)−hd(mk|k(j)(yc))sin⁡aˆk(j)cos⁡eˆk(j)]/rˆk(j),h3(j)=[(z˙ˆk|k(j)−z˙ks)−hd(mk|k(j)(yc))sin⁡eˆk(j)]/rˆk(j),h4(j)=cos⁡aˆk(j)cos⁡eˆk(j),h5(j)=sin⁡aˆk(j)cos⁡eˆk(j),h6(j)=sin⁡eˆk(j),rˆk(j)=(xˆk|k(j)−xks)2+(yˆk|k(j)−yks)2+(zˆk|k(j)−zks)2,aˆk(j)=atan2[(yˆk|k(j)−yks),(xˆk|k(j)−xks)],andeˆk(j)=arctan⁡[(zˆk|k(j)−zks)/(xˆk|k(j)−xks)2+(yˆk|k(j)−yks)2].Note that since the Doppler measurement is a nonlinear function, the derivation of (25) and (26), in a similar way of the extended Kalman filter update [40], have utilized the following relation(34)N(yd;hd(x),σd2)N(x;mk|k(j)(yc),Pk|k(j)(yc))≈N(yd;hd(mk|k(j)(yc)),Ξd,k(j)(yc))N(x;mk|k(j)(z),Pk|k(j)(z))The component{wk|k,f(j),mk|k,f(j),Pk|k,f(j)}is updated with the fictitious measurement, calculated as(35)wk|k,f(j)=pD1−pDcf⋅N(yf(mk|k−1(j));Hf(mk|k−1(j))mk|k−1(j),Ξf,k(j))⋅wk|k,0(j)(36)mk|k,f(j)=mk|k−1(j)+Kf,k(j)(yf(mk|k−1(j))−Hf(mk|k−1(j))⋅mk|k−1(j))(37)Pk|k,f(j)=[I−Kf,k(j)Hf(mk|k−1(j))]Pk|k−1(j)where the gainKf,k(j)for the fictitious measurement is obtained by(38)Kf,k(j)=Pk|k−1(j)Hf(mk|k−1(j))[Ξf,k(j)]−1with the innovation variance for the fictitious measurement(39)Ξf,k(j)=Hf(mk|k−1(j))Pk|k−1(j)[Hf(mk|k−1(j))]T+RfThe component{wk|k(j)(zf),mk|k(j)(zf),Pk|k(j)(zf)}is further updated by using the fictitious measurement based on{wk|k(j)(z),mk|k(j)(z),Pk|k(j)(z)}, i.e.,(40)wk|k(j)(zf)=−cf⋅N(yf(mk|k(j)(z));Hf(mk|k(j)(z))⋅mk|k(j)(z),Ξf,k(j)(z))⋅wk|k(j)(z)(41)mk|k(j)(zf)=mk|k(j)(z)+Gf,k(j)(z)(yf(mk|k(j)(z))−Hf(mk|k(j)(z))⋅mk|k(j)(z))(42)Pk|k(j)(zf)=[I−Gf,k(j)(z)Hf(mk|k(j)(z))]Pk|k(j)(z)where the corresponding gainGf,k(j)(z)for the fictitious measurement is obtained by(43)Gf,k(j)(z)=Pk|k(j)(z)Hf(mk|k(j)(z))[Ξf,k(j)(z)]−1with the corresponding innovation variance for the fictitious measurement(44)Ξf,k(j)(z)=Hf(mk|k(j)(z))Pk|k(j)(z)[Hf(mk|k(j)(z))]T+Rf.In the denominator of (24), the clutter intensity is modeled by(45)κk(z)=κc,k(yc)⋅κd,k(yd)whereκc,k(yc)andκd,k(yd)are the clutter intensity for the position component and Doppler component, respectively, and the quantitywsumis given by(46)wsum=pD∑j=1Jk|k−1wk|k−1(j)qk(j)(z)−cfpD∑j=1Jk|k−1wk|k−1(j)qk(j)(zf)with(47)qk(j)(z)=N(yc;Hc,kmk|k−1(j),Ξc,k(j))⋅N(yd;hd(mk|k(j)(yc)),Ξd,k(j)(yc))and(48)qk(j)(zf)=qk(j)(z)⋅N(yf(mk|k(j)(z));Hf(mk|k(j)(z))⋅mk|k(j)(z),Ξf,k(j)(z)).Remark 1After the measurement update, the “pruning–merging” procedure similar to that of [29] is required, since the number of Gaussian components increases without bound as time evolves. Moreover, the parameters used in the procedure and the multi-target state extraction are the same as those in [29].Remark 2It is expected that the proposed technique can be extended to such more advanced filters as the GM-CPHD [41] or Gaussian mixture cardinality balanced multi-target multi-Bernoulli (GM-CBMeMBer) filter [42] to improve the accuracy of multi-target state estimates, in a similar way of the proposed filter.The proposed GM-PHD filter with the Doppler and MDV information is called as the GM-PHD-D&MDV for short. It should be pointed out that ifMDV=0, thencf=0, thus the GM-PHD-D&MDV filter will reduce to the GM-PHD filter with Doppler (GM-PHD-D) given in [43]. Compared with the GM-PHD-D filter, the substitution of the detection probability into the update intensity (17) leads to a twofold increase in the number of Gaussian components, because the detection probability in (15) is made up of two terms and each new component now splits into two. This means that, besides theJk|k−1components with{wk|k,0(j),mk|k,0(j),Pk|k,0(j)}and|Zk|⋅Jk|k−1components with{wk|k(j)(z),mk|k(j)(z),Pk|k(j)(z)}, we obtain the same number of additional components including theJk|k−1components with{wk|k,f(j),mk|k,f(j),Pk|k,f(j)}and|Zk|⋅Jk|k−1components with{wk|k(j)(zf),mk|k(j)(zf),Pk|k(j)(zf)}. Due to the increased number of components established in the update step, the proposed algorithm is capable to interpret the filter behavior in a more sophisticated manner. In (21), the first term handles the conventional MD case, and the first term handles the conventional measurement case, while the third term handles the fictitious measurement case, and the last term handles the augmented measurement case. For the third case, when a target moves into the DBZ, a relative high value of the component weight is obtained according to (35), which may prevent the track from being deleted by the truncation threshold in the “pruning–merging” procedure. For the last case, the corresponding component weightwk|k(j)(zf)is indicated by the negative sign (see (40)). In the concrete implementation, these components will be deleted in the “pruning–merging” procedure since these negative weights are certainly lesser than the positive truncation threshold. Nevertheless, these negative weights should be added to the corresponding conventional detection component weights, i.e.,wk|k(j)(z)=wk|k(j)(z)+wk|k(j)(zf), since the sum of all weights represents the mean of the cardinality of targets. Moreover, it is shown in (21) that each component splits two, no matter whether its state falls into the DBZ or not. Actually, we only need to preserve the component corresponding to the target in the DBZ, thus the component will be split into two when its state(mk|k−1(j),Pk|k−1(j))satisfiesnc(mk|k−1(j))≤MDV+Ξd,k(j), whereΞd,k(j)=Hd(mk|k−1(j))Pk|k−1(j)[Hd(mk|k−1(j))]T+σd2, and vice versa. In the following, the approximate GM-PHD-D&MDV filter is named as the GM-PHD-D&MDV1. For completeness, we summarize key update steps of the GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filter in Table 1.The proposed GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filter is compared with the GM-PHD-D filter. Additionally, the performances of the GM-PHD filter (without Doppler) and the original GM-PHD-D&MDV filter are served as the performance benchmark.For convenience, each target in x–y plane follows the linear Gaussian dynamics(49)xk=Fk−1xk−1+vk−1wherexk=[xkykx˙ky˙k]Tis the target state. The transition matrix is given by(50)Fk−1=[1τk01]⊗I2whereInis ann×nidentity matrix,τk=1sis the time interval, ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product, andvk−1is zero-mean white Gaussian process noise with covariance(51)Qk−1=[τk4/4τk3/2τk3/2τk2]⊗diag(σx2,σy2)whereσx2andσy2are the variances of the process noise modeling the acceleration along x and y axes, respectively.Each target has survival probabilitypS,k=0.99, and it is detected with probabilitypD=0.98. The target-originated measurement follows the observation model (18) withHc,k=[I202],Rc,k=σc2⋅I2,σd=0.5m/s, whereσc=10mis the standard deviation of the position measurement noise. The clutter follows uniform distributions over the surveillance region[−1000,1000](m)×[−1000,1000](m), and it is modeled asκc,k(⋅)=λc⋅V⋅u(⋅)for the position component andκd,k=1/2vmaxfor the Doppler component, whereλcis the mean number of clutter per unit volume, V is the “volume” of the surveillance region,u(⋅)represents the uniform density, andvmax=35m/sis the maximum speed that the sensor can detect.For fair comparison, all filters are assumed to have fixed birth locations. The pruning parameters are set to be: truncation thresholdT=10−5, merging thresholdU=4, and maximum number of Gaussian componentsJmax=100. The extraction threshold is set to be 0.5.(a) 2-dimensional stationary sensor scenarioFor illustration purpose, we first consider an example of tracking 2 targets with measurements from a sensor located at the origin (0m, 0m). The initial target states are set to bex0,1=[−500m200m10m/s0m/s]Tandx0,2=[−500m−200m10m/s0m/s]T, respectively. The process noise is characterized byσx=σy=5m/s2. The spontaneous birth RFS is Poisson distributed with intensityγk(x)=0.1∑j=12N(x;mγ,k(j),Pγ,k(j))wheremγ,k(1)=[−500m,200m,0m/s,0m/s]T,mγ,k(2)=[−500m,−200m,0m/s,0m/s]T,Pγ,k(j)=blkdiag(100m,100m,25m/s,25m/s)2,j=1,2. The “blkdiag” represents the block diagonal matrix.Fig. 1gives the sensor's position, targets' true trajectories, and clutter. In the above configuration, the true Doppler of two targets and different MDV values versus time are shown in Fig. 2. It is suggested that the two targets move tangentially at timek=50, so their Doppler values at that time are close to 0, and the greater the MDV value is, the longer the time when the target passes through the DBZ is consumed, and the larger the number of the MDs is.Fig. 3shows true trajectories and their estimates from different algorithms whenMDV=1m/s. It is seen that all of filters can track the two targets successfully before the targets enter into the DBZ (the first stage). However, the GM-PHD is the poorest, and others have the similar results. During the targets pass through the DBZ (the second stage), however, all of them fail. Note that all filters are assumed to have fixed birth locations. Hence, the GM-PHD and GM-PHD-D filters cannot track targets anymore due to a series of MDs. Nevertheless, once the targets move outside the DBZ (the third stage), the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filters can track them again since they preserve Gaussian components corresponding to targets inside the DBZ. Therefore, by incorporating the additional MDV knowledge, the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filters are able to reasonably treat the MDs and to maintain the track.To evaluate the performance, we investigate track loss by using the circular position error probability (CPEP) [29](52)CPEPk(r)=1|Xk|∑x∈Xkρk(x,r)whereρk(x,r)=Prob{‖Hxˆ−Hx‖2>rfor allxˆ∈Xˆk},H=[I202],‖⋅‖2is the 2-norm, and r denotes some position error radius. From the above definition,CPEP→0indicates a superior tracking performance whileCPEP→1suggests a poor performance. In addition, we measure the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) error [44].Figs. 4–6show the tracking performances of different filters for various MDV values through 1000 Monte Carlo runs. The CPEP radius is fixed atr=20mfor the CPEP, while for the OSPA the order and cut-off (see [44] for the meaning of these parameters) are set to bep=2andc=20m, respectively. In Fig. 4 whereMDV=1, it is observed that at the first stage, due to introduction of the Doppler information, the GM-PHD-D, GM-PHD-D&MDV, and GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filters have the similar performances in terms of both the CEPE and OSPA, and they are superior to the GM-PHD which doesn't include the Doppler. At the second stage, all of them cannot track targets masked by the DBZ because the weights of Gaussian components are lesser than the extraction threshold so that there is no state to be extracted. However, the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filters have a fundamental difference from the GM-PHD-D and GM-PHD filters which don't include the MDV information. For the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filters, a high value of the component weight with respect to the truncation threshold may be obtained according to (35), which prevent the track from being deleted. However, for the GM-PHD-D and GM-PHD filters, when targets are masked by the DBZ, they don't have a similar mechanism of preserving effectively the components corresponding to targets and these components will be deleted since their weights are lesser than the truncation threshold. Thus, the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filters are capable of tracking targets again when targets are outside the DBZ, while the GM-PHD-D and GM-PHD filters cannot track targets any more.The similar improvement tendency can also be seen from Figs. 5–6. Nevertheless, through contrastive analysis from Figs. 4–6, attention should be paid on the following points for the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV1. First, the performance of the approximate GM-PHD-D&MDV1 is very similar to that of the original GM-PHD-D&MDV. On the other hand, it is observed from Fig. 7that the former is faster than the latter, where the absolute time is consumed to execute 100 time steps in each run (averaged 1000 Monte Carlo runs) in MATLAB 7.14 on a 3.2 GHz (Intel) Core i5 operating under Windows 7 (Ultimate). WhenMDV=1m/s, for instance, the GM-PHD-D&MDV1 requires 11.05 s (for all 100 time steps) while the GM-PHD-D&MDV needs 22.87 s. Relatively speaking, the time consumption of the former is only 48.29% of that of the latter. Hence, the approximate method can effectively reduce the amount of calculation without a significant degradation in performance. Second, as the MDV value increases, the CPEP value after the DBZ masking cannot decrease to its original value at the first stage, and the CPEP difference between the first stage and the third stage becomes large, because the possibility that the targets cannot be tracked after the DBZ masking will be increasing, since it is more difficult to preserve the components after more missed detections. Third, with the MDV increasing, it is easier that the weight of the component updated by the fictitious measurement is greater than the extraction threshold, thus the extracted false tracks will increase. Hence, the OSPA cardinality performance becomes large before targets enter into the DBZ. In brief, the performance improvement of the proposed filter is obtained at the cost of the increasing number of false tracks when the MDV is large. However, when the MDV value is small, the tracking performance is improved without increasing markedly the number of false tracks. Additionally, at the third stage, it seems that the OSPA localization performances of the GM-PHD-D and GM-PHD filters are superior to those of the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filters. Indeed, the phenomenon is caused by the corresponding OSPA cardinality approaching to the cut-off value. So the total OSPA performances of the GM-PHD-D and GM-PHD filters are still inferior to those of the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filters.(b) 3-dimensional moving sensor scenarioFor a general case, we consider an example of tracking 2 targets with measurements from a moving sensor. The sensor is traveling along a circle (inz=100mplane) at constant speed. Its initial state is[600m−150m10m/s0m/s]Tand the constant angular (turn) rate is 0.063 rad/s. The initial target states are set to bex0,1=[0m0m5m/s5m/s]Tandx0,2=[0m0m5m/s−5m/s]T, respectively. The process noise is characterized byσx=σy=2m/s2. The spontaneous birth RFS is Poisson distributed with intensityγk(x)=0.1N(x;mγ,k,Pγ,k)wheremγ,k=[0m,0m,0m/s,0m/s]T,Pγ,k=blkdiag(100m,100m,25m/s,25m/s)2.Fig. 8gives the trajectories of the sensor and targets. In this configuration, the true Doppler of two targets and the corresponding DBZ versus time are shown in Fig. 9. It is suggested that the time periods when targets are inside the DBZ are 43 s–53 s for target 2 and 61 s–65 s for target 1, respectively.Fig. 10shows the tracking performances of different filters through 1000 Monte Carlo runs. It is observed that during target 2 is masked by the DBZ (43 s–53 s), all of filters cannot track target 2 but they can track target 1. Hence, the CPEP increases to around 0.5 and the total OSPA increases to a higher level. Once target 2 moves outside the DBZ, the performances of the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV filters will be improved while those of the GM-PHD and GM-PHD-D filters remain relatively unchanged, which suggests that the former filters can track target 2 again but the latter filters cannot do. Similarly, during the time when target 1 is masked by the DBZ (61 s–65 s), the CPEP and total OSPA of the GM-PHD and GM-PHD-D filters increase to around 1 and the cut-off 20, respectively, which suggests that they cannot track both target 1 and target 2. At this time period, the CPEP and total OSPA of the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV filters are recovered to the previous level at 43 s–53 s, because target 1 cannot be tracked but target 2 is still tracked. After 66 s, both target 1 and target 2 are outside the DBZ and they are tracked successfully by the GM-PHD-D&MDV and GM-PHD-D&MDV filters. However, the GM-PHD and GM-PHD-D filters fail to track them.In summary, owing to incorporating with the Doppler measurement, the GM-PHD-D performs better than the GM-PHD before targets enter into the DBZ. Similarly, when the GM-PHD-D is incorporated with the MDV information, the resulting GM-PHD-D&MDV filter outperforms the GM-PHD-D filter. The approximate GM-PHD-D&MDV1 filter is further presented to reduce the computational time compared with the GM-PHD-D&MDV.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, a GM-PHD filter with the Doppler and MDV information has been proposed for multi-target tracking in the presence of the DBZ. The novel GM-PHD update expressions have been derived, and an approximate filter with detailed implementation steps has been introduced to reduce the amount of calculation without a significant degradation in performance. Simulation results show that the proposed filter outperforms the GM-PHD and GM-PHD-D filters without incorporating the MDV information, and it has better performance at small MDV value. To resolve the problem of extracting targets hidden inside the DBZ, one of our future works will be focused on track labeling for multi-target tracking in the presence of the DBZ by using the most latest labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) [45] or generalized LMB approach [46].
