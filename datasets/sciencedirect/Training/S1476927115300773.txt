@&#ABSTRACT@&#
GolS genes stand as potential candidate genes for molecular breeding and/or engineering programs in order for improving abiotic stress tolerance in plant species. In this study, a total of six galactinol synthase (GolS) genes/proteins were retrieved forSolanum lycopersicum andBrachypodium distachyon. GolS protein sequences were identified to include glyco_transf_8 (PF01501) domain structure, and to have a close molecular weight (36.40–39.59kDa) and amino acid length (318–347 aa) with a slightly acidic pI (5.35–6.40). The sub-cellular location was mainly predicted as cytoplasmic. S. lycopersicum genes located on chr 1 and 2, and included one segmental duplication while genes of B. distachyon were only on chr 1 with one tandem duplication. GolS sequences were found to have well conserved motif structures. Cis-acting analysis was performed for three abiotic stress responsive elements, including ABA responsive element (ABRE), dehydration and cold responsive elements (DRE/CRT) and low-temperature responsive element (LTRE). ABRE elements were found in all GolS genes, except for SlGolS4; DRE/CRT was not detected in any GolS genes and LTRE element found in SlGolS1 and BdGolS1 genes. AU analysis in UTR and ORF regions indicated that SlGolS and BdGolS mRNAs may have a short half-life. SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 genes may generate more stable transcripts since they included AATTAAA motif for polyadenylation signal POLASIG2. Seconder structures of SlGolS proteins were well conserved than that of BdGolS. Some structural divergences were detected in 3D structures and predicted binding sites exhibited various patterns in GolS proteins.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Plants overcome biotic/abiotic environmental stress conditions by acquiring stress tolerance (Seki et al., 2003). This is achieved by stress perception and signaling, leading to the induction of stress responsive genes or transcription factors (Loescher, 2010). Stress responsive genes are categorized in two main groups. First group contains osmoprotectants, late embryogenesis abundant proteins, antifreeze proteins, chaperones and detoxification enzymes, and play an important role in protecting the cell against dehydration. Second group includes transcription factors, protein kinases and enzymes involved in phosphoinositide metabolism, which serve as regulators in gene expression and signal transduction (Hasegawa et al., 2000; Seki et al., 2003). Under stress conditions, plants produce regulatory compounds such as mannitol, proline and a large number of soluble oligosaccharides (trehalose, raffinose and stachyose) to protect the cell against stresses (Cuin and Shabala, 2008). Especially raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) has been intensively studied because of its potential role in desiccation tolerance (Downie et al., 2003; Garcia et al., 2006). Raffinose is synthesized by the donation of galactose from galactinol to sucrose by raffinose synthase. Therefore, synthesis of galactinol is an important step in RFO biosynthesis (Zhou et al., 2014). Galactinol synthase (GolS) (EC 2.4.1.123) catalyzes the synthesis of galactinol from the UDP-d-galactose and myo-inositol (Liu et al., 1995). Galactinol synthase genes have been well characterized in many plants species and most of these genes were reported to be upregulated by abiotic stress conditions/treatments, indicating that overexpressed activities of GolS genes improve stress tolerance by increasing the synthesis of galactinol and raffinose respectively (Taji et al., 2002). Moreover, promoters of stress responsive genes generally include typical cis-regulatory elements such as DRE/CRT, ABRE and MYCRS/MYBRS, and these elements are regulated by various upstream transcriptional factors (Mahajan and Tuteja, 2005).Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is an economically and experimentally important crop species and also widely used in domestication and breeding programs (Schauer et al., 2008), fruit development, ripening (Klee and Giovannoni, 2011), and plant defense studies (Cuartero et al., 2006). Brachypodium distachyon is a grass species and suitable model organism for functional genomics studies because of its small genome size, physical stature, short lifecycle, simple growth requirements, self-fertility and efficient transformation system (Draper et al., 2001; Ozdemir et al., 2008). In the present study, galactinol synthase (GolS) genes have been identified at genome-wide scale in S. lycopersicum and B. distachyon species. Also, we have performed a comparative in silico analysis of plant GolS genes/proteins in tomato (S. lycopersicum) and B. distachyon species. In this context, UTR and coding regions of genes were comparatively analyzed; physico-chemical properties and conserved motifs were determined; 3D structure of proteins was predicted and phylogenetic tree was constructed.Reference galactinol synthase (GolS) protein sequences with AAO72744.1 (for S. lycopersicum) and AAQ07250.1 (for B. distachyon) accession numbers were retrieved from protein database of NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/). Then these sequences were queried against proteome datasets of S. lycopersicum and B. distachyon in Phytozome v.10 (http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html) (Goodstein et al., 2012) database by using Blastp. Resulting sequences were filtered for ≤e-100 and finally a total of 6 genes (four genes for S. lycopersicum and two genes for B. distachyon) were obtained. Later, S. lycopersicum genes with Solyc01g100830.1, Solyc02g084980.2, Solyc01g079170.2 and Solyc02g062590.2 accession numbers renamed as SlGolS1, SlGolS2, SlGolS3 and SlGolS4 respectively, and B. distachyon genes with Bradi1g64120 and Bradi1g17200 accession numbers renamed as BdGolS1 and BdGolS2, respectively in this study (Table 1). Domain analysis of GolS sequences was performed by pfam server (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk) (Sonnhammer et al., 1997).Sequence length, molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) of GolS proteins were analyzed by Expasy’s ProtParam server (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/) (Gasteiger et al., 2005). The conserved motif analysis was performed by using MEME tool (Timothy et al., 2009) (http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/cgi-bin/meme.cgi) with following parameters; maximum number of motifs to find, 5; minimum width of motif, 6 and maximum width of motif, 50. The sub-cellular locations of GolS proteins were predicted by CELLO v.2.5 (subCELlular LOcalization predictor) (http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/) (Yu et al., 2006).Exon/intron organizations of GolS genes were analyzed by GSDS 2.0 (Gene Structure Display Server) (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/) (Guo et al., 2007). Gene duplication was detected by using multiple alignment of blastn in NCBI with following criteria: (1) length of alignable sequence covers >80% of longer gene and (2) similarity of aligned regions >80% (Gu et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2008). Digital expression profiles of GolS genes were obtained from Genevestigator (https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/plant.jsp) for anatomical and development stage levels (Hruz et al., 2008).Putative functional annotations of GolS genes were done by using search tool in Gramene (http://www.gramene.org/) database (Yamazaki and Jaiswal, 2005). Annotation based on the gene ontology (GO) terms covering molecular function, biological processes and cellular localization (Table 3).GolS sequences were aligned by ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994) and phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA v 5.1 (Tamura et al., 2011) with neighbor-joining (NJ) method for 1000 bootstrap value. Phylogenetic tree was constructed with 31 GolS protein sequences from 11 higher plant species, including S. lycopersicum (4), B. distachyon (2), Populus trichocarpa (9), Arabidopsis thaliana (7), Gossypium hirsutum (1), Glycine max (1), Coffea arabica (1), Cucumis sativus (1), Brassica napus (1), Triticum aestivum (1), and Zea mays (3).3D structure of GolS proteins was predicted by 3DLigandSite server (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/3dligandsite/) (Wass et al., 2010) and analyzed by using Swiss Pdb Viewer 4.1.0. 3D model quality was checked by Rampage Ramachandran plot analysis (http://mordred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/∼rapper/rampage.php) (Lovell et al., 2003).5′ UTR region (−1000 to +0) of 6 GolS genes were retrieved from Phytozome database and a manual search was conducted to identify AU-rich regions, poly(A) signals and DST. Binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) for cis-regulatory elements (CREs) were analyzed by using PlantCARE (Plant Cis-Actin Regulatory Element) database (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html//) (Lescot et al., 2002).Transcript and coding sequences of GolS genes were retrieved from Phytozome database. A manual search was conducted to detect AU-rich regions, poly(A) signals and DST.
