@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The influence of information, communication and technology (ICT) has been strongly felt in the field of medicine through tele-diagnosis, tele-consulting, and tele-surgery. In this era of ICT, multimedia tools have been used to share the e-medical data of patients among the entitled users with maximum secrecy to confirm the privacy of individuals. Recently, secured telemedicine implementations have been on demand because medical images have been used in various research studies [1]. In particular, DICOM images require better and improved security than normal images because they address e-medical data [2], which has more accountability in terms of insurance policies. It can be protected by encryption keys, digital signatures, watermarking, steganography, cryptographic algorithms, chaotic sequences and hash functions.Security and privacy are two sides of a sword and are required against hackers for a secure digital communication in the present scenario of the “Global Village” invented on the Internet [3]. The evolution of cryptography and its application in the fields of mathematics, computer science and engineering, smart grids, and wireless cognitive radio [4] have been phenomenal in recent years. In this context, image encryption has emerged as a powerful cryptic tool and the strong nexus between cryptography and chaos [5]. The fusion of traditional cryptic and modern chaotic features, namely confusion, diffusion, ergodicity, and randomness have evolved as a stronger tool in the form of image encryption [6–8], which can be adopted for establishing secured digital communication. Recently, many researchers have proposed and implemented image encryption algorithms using different transform techniques, chaotic systems [9–14], multiplexing [15–17], compression [18] and fusion [19–22] techniques. Authors have implemented different transform domain based image encryption algorithms, especially in gyrator domains. Huijuan Li [23] has implemented an optical image encryption technique by adapting the gyrator transform and two-step phase shifting interferometry. Liu et al. [24] proposed a random phase encryption method in which an iterative structure was used to generate more randomness for an enhanced cryptic effect.Furthermore, Zheng and Huang [25] proposed an image encryption algorithm by performing a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and an expansion of data in cipher mode. Additionally, authors have adapted the Walsh–Hadamard transform (WHT), binary discrete Hartley transform (BDHT), DCT, and hybrid diagonal block-set transform (FHDBT) techniques for image encryption applications. To further the complexity, authors have developed image encryption algorithms based on compression techniques [26]. Under the compression schemes, the Huffman, multiple Huffman table, run-length and dictionary algorithms were employed to generate cryptic images. During this evolution of image encryption algorithms, a novel double image scheme emerged as a multiplexed scheme. In this superimposed platform, researchers have adopted multiplexed double pixel scrambling [27], fractional random encoding [28], fractional random encoding using the chaotic approach [29,30], amplitude encoding, phase encoding [31] and random, iterative random encoding to perform image encryption coding. In the same line, fusion algorithms were developed to encrypt both monochrome and colour images.Recently, chaotic encryption schemes have attracted the attention of many researchers because of their excellent randomness and complexity [32]. A piecewise linear chaotic map was employed on a colour image for scrambling, and additional confusion and diffusion was performed simultaneously on the three colour planes. In addition, the logistic, standard, tent map, skew tent map, Lorentz system, time delay Lorentz system, 6D chaotic system, Arnold cat map, circulant operations, and Tompkin׳s Paige algorithms were considered to perform image encryption schemes.For the secured storage and transfer of DICOM images, the transformation of pixels and matrices was performed, resulting in permuted, diffused and confused encrypted data. Many OpenWare tools were designed and developed to make medical images available for secondary applications including research projects and to build healthcare networks [33]. Medical images are normally classified into two categories: region of interest (ROI) and region of background (ROB). To reduce the processing time and the number of overheads, ROI and ROB were processed separately with same or different encryption keys and algorithms [34,35]. The watermarking of patient information, hospital LOGO and doctor details can be embedded on ROB while leaving ROI unchanged. To further improve authentication, the finger printing, hash functions and digital signatures of patient information were embedded as secret data on ROB [36].The efficient and real-time medical image transmission using bit level shuffling, substitution and permutation was performed by Jun-xin Chen et al. [37] to provide image protection. Dalel Bouslimi et al. [38] developed an algorithm to validate the consistency of DICOM images, which resulted in reducing and avoiding image distortion. Watermarking combined with encryption or steganography schemes and cryptographic algorithms such as AES, DES, RC4, and IDEA can be used to provide enhanced image security and authentication. Yen-Cheng Chen et al. analysed the usage of block ciphers for handling large and enormous image sizes, which are a needed option currently for handling real-time applications. The authors used fingerprints as verification data to authenticate the medical images [39]. Muhaya et al. proposed a chaotic technique to protect medical images by scrambling the pixel values and by combining various cryptographic mechanisms and key management schemes [40].To provide reliable, error-free transmission and reception of DICOM images, various error control codes such as repetitive and hamming codes have been used. Multiple chaotic encryption schemes with compression, watermarking and the concept of Galois field were used by Prasad and Mishra [41] for enriching the security of medical data. Kannammal and Subha Rani [42] implemented a joint encryption and watermarking algorithm to provide a two-level security feature to medical images. The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) standard has been used to compress medical images, and copyright protection was ensured by watermarking techniques [43]. Patient information was interleaved with medical images to reduce the transmission overheads. Image encryption for medical images was also considered by using chaotic systems and watermarking incorporated hyper chaotic systems to protect the same [44,45].Panduranga et al.[46] described about encryption scheme that combines chaotic map and LSIC results in diffusion and permutation of the encrypted ciphers. Yue Wuet al., [47] proposed the Latin square matrix concept which has been adapted to implement the image encryption algorithm for embedding random noise into LSB of the images that generates confusion in the embedded cipher text.Varsaki et al. [48] and Hoang et al. [49] proposed a high capacity stego system by using the discrete Gould transform (DGT) to provide image authentication and tamper proof, respectively.Image encryption using Rubik׳s cube principle has been addressed to permute the pixels of the image for shuffling [50,51].However, the majority of the existing techniques employ either chaotic or cryptic effects, which are not stern enough against hackers. Hence, in this work, a tri-layer cryptic technique has been proposed in which confusion, diffusion, tamper proofing, permutation, randomness and ergodicity have been fused in a single platform to perform triple encryption. Section 2 presents the proposed methodology, and Section 3 explains the results and discussion. Finally, Section 4 concludes with the salient features of the implemented encryption system.
