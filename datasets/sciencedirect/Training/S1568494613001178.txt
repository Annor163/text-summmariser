@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We develop a new compatibility for the uncertain additive linguistic preference relations and study its properties which are very suitable to deal with group decision making (GDM) problems involving uncertain additive linguistic preference relations. Based on the linguistic continuous ordered weighted averaging (LCOWA) operator, we present some concepts of the compatibility degree and compatibility index for the two uncertain additive linguistic preference relations. Then, we study some desirable properties including the property that the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relation is of acceptable compatibility under the condition that uncertain additive linguistic preference relations given by experts are all of acceptable compatibility with the ideal uncertain linguistic preference relation, which provides a theoretic basis for the application of the uncertain additive linguistic preference relations in GDM. In order to determine the weights of experts, we construct an optimal model based on the criterion of minimizing the compatibility index in GDM. Finally, we propose a new approach based on the compatibility index and the expected additive linguistic preference relation to GDM and develop an application of the optimal weights approach compared with the equal weights approach where we analyze a GDM regarding the evaluation of schools in a university.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Group decision making (GDM) is a process that combines experts’ preferences into an overall one by using a proper aggregation technique. During the recent decades, investigations on preference relations are receiving surprisingly extensive attentions. In the literature, we find a wide range of preference relations for dealing with GDM problem, including the multiplicative preference relation [1–5], the fuzzy preference relation [6–8], the multiplicative linguistic preference relation [9–12], the additive linguistic preference relation [11,13–17], and the intuitionistic preference relation [18–23].However, due to the increasing complexity of the socio-economic environment and the lack of knowledge or data about the problem domain, in the process of GDM, experts may provide their preferences over alternatives with uncertain variables, including interval variables [24], linguistic variables [12], intuitionistic fuzzy variables [22,25]. For example, many researchers pay attention to GDM with the uncertain fuzzy preference relations [26–29], the uncertain multiplicative preference relations [30–35], the uncertain additive linguistic preference relations [36–38], the uncertain multiplicative linguistic preference relations [39] and the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations [40].A key feature in order to use all kinds of preference relations in GDM is the compatibility degree. The lack of acceptable compatibility can result in unsatisfied decision making with preference relations because of that there is significant difference among the preference relations provided by experts in GDM [36]. In [4], Saaty and Vargas presented the compatibility to judge the difference between the two multiplicative preference relations. Xu extended the compatibility degree to uncertain environment and developed the compatibility degree of two uncertain fuzzy preference relations [27]. Chen, Zhou and Han proposed a new compatibility degree for the uncertain additive linguistic preference relations and utilized it to determine the optimal weights of experts in GDM [36]. Moreover, we are able to get different compatibilities of preference relations including multiplicative preference relations, additive preference relations, uncertain multiplicative preference relations, uncertain additive preference relations, multiplicative linguistic preference relations, additive linguistic preference relations, uncertain multiplicative linguistic preference relations and uncertain additive linguistic preference relations. Some references about different compatibilities for different preference relations are shown in Table 1. Note that we can find more details from these references. And therefore, it is necessary to investigate this issue.Another crucial issue of GDM is to aggregate the information. The ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator introduced by Yager [43] is one of the most common aggregation operators found in the literature. It provides a parameterized family of aggregation operators that includes the maximum, the minimum and the average criteria. Since its introduction, the OWA operator has been studied in a wide range of applications and extensions [10,11,22,24,34,35,38,39,44–67]. A very practical extension of the OWA operator is the continuous ordered weighted averaging (COWA) operator in which the argument to be aggregated is interval number [68]. Since its appearance, the COWA operator has attracted more and more attention from both decision makers and researchers [14,26,28,30,33–35,65]. Based on the COWA operator, Zhang and Xu [63] extended the COWA operator to the linguistic environment and obtained the linguistic COWA (LCOWA) operator.The aim of this work consists in developing a new compatibility for the uncertain additive linguistic preference relations based on the LCOWA operator. We present some concepts of the compatibility degree and compatibility index for the two uncertain additive linguistic preference relations. The main advantage of these concepts is that they parameterize the results according to the interests of the experts by using the LCOWA operator. We also study some desirable properties. Especially, we prove the property that the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relation is of acceptable compatibility under the condition that uncertain additive linguistic preference relations given by experts are all of acceptable compatibility with the ideal uncertain linguistic preference relation, which provides the scientific base of using the uncertain additive linguistic preference relations in GDM. Furthermore, to determine the weights of experts, we construct a mathematical model based on the criterion of minimizing the compatibility index in GDM. Moreover, a new approach based on the compatibility index and the expected additive linguistic preference relation to group decision making with uncertain additive linguistic preference relations is developed. The prominent characteristic of the new approach is that it can measure the reliability of information given by different experts based on the criterion of minimizing the compatibility index of uncertain multiplicative linguistic preference relations, which is more effective than other existing ones. Finally, an illustrative example shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the optimal experts’ weights approach compared with the equal weights.In order to do that, this work is set out as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review some basic concepts. Section 3 presents the concepts of compatibility degree of uncertain additive linguistic preference relations based on the LCOWA operator and gives the main results. In Section 4, we build up the optimal model to determine the optimal experts’ weights in GDM and investigate the solution to the model. In Section 5, we develop a new approach to group decision making. In Section 6, we present an illustrative example of the new approach focusing on the evaluation of schools in a university. Finally, in Section 7 we summarize the main conclusions of the paper.In this section, we briefly review the uncertain additive linguistic variable, the uncertain additive linguistic preference relation, the OWA operator, the COWA operator and the LCOWA operator.Let S={sα|α=−t, …, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …, t} be an additive linguistic label set with odd cardinality, which requires that the additive linguistic label set should satisfy the following characteristics [17,36]:(1)The additive linguistic label set S is ordered: if sα,sβ∈S and α>β, then sα>sβ.There exists the negation operator: neg(sα)=sβsuch that α+β=0,where sαand sβrepresent possible values for the linguistic variables and t is a positive integer.The additive linguistic label set S is called the additive linguistic scale. For example, a set of nine labels S can be defined as:S={s−4=EL,s−3=VL,s−2=L,s−1=SL,s0=M,s1=SH,s2=H,s3=VH,s4=EH}.Note that EL=extremely low, VL=very low, L=low, SL=slightly low, M=medium, SH=slightly high, H=high, VH=very high, and EH=extremely high.In order to preserve all the given information, we can extend the discrete additive linguistic label set S to a continuous additive linguistic label setS˜;={sα|α∈[−q,q]},where q(q>t) is a sufficiently large positive integer. If sα∈S, we call sαthe original additive linguistic label, which is provided to evaluate alternatives by the DMs, otherwise, we call sαthe virtual additive linguistic label, which can only appear in operations.Definition 1Lets˜;=[sα,sβ]={x|sα≤x≤sβ},thens˜;is called the uncertain additive linguistic variable, wheresα,sβ∈S˜;,sα,sβare the lower and upper limits, respectively. Especially,s˜;is called the additive linguistic variable if sα=sβ.Consider any three uncertain additive linguistic variabless˜;=[sα,sβ],s˜;1=[sα1,sβ1]ands˜;2=[sα2,sβ2]and let μ,μ1,μ2∈[0,1], Xu defined some operational laws as follows [54]:s˜;1⊕s˜;2=[sα1,sβ1]⊕[sα2,sβ2]=[sα1⊕sα2,sβ1⊕sβ2]=[sα1+α2,sβ1+β2].s˜;1⊕s˜;2=s˜;2⊕s˜;1.μs˜;=μ[sα,sβ]=[μsα,μsβ]=[sμα,sμβ].μ1s˜;⊕μ2s˜;=(μ1+μ2)s˜;.μ(s˜;1⊕s˜;2)=μs˜;1⊕μs˜;2.In a GDM problem, let X={x1,x2,…,xn} be a finite set of alternatives. When a DM makes pairwise comparisons using the additive linguistic label set S, he/she can express his/her own opinions by an additive linguistic preference relation on X[17]. The additive linguistic preference relation can be defined as follows:Definition 2[17]. An additive linguistic preference relation on the set X is denoted by a linguistic decision matrixA=(aij)n×n⊂X×X, such thatHowever, experts may possibly provide only uncertain additive linguistic preference relations [38] because of time pressure, lack of knowledge or data and their limited expertise related to the problem domain. The uncertain additive linguistic preference relation can be defined as follows.Definition 3[38]. An uncertain additive linguistic preference relation on the set X is defined as matrixA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n⊂X×XsatisfyingNote that throughout this paper, let Mnbe the set of all n×n uncertain additive linguistic preference relations. For convenience, supposing thatsα∈S˜;,I(sα)denotes the lower index of additive linguistic label sα, then we have I(sα)=α>0.And more generally, Chen, Zhou and Han developed the following theorem [36]:Theorem 1[36]. Ifsαi∈S˜;and λi∈[0,1] for i=1,2,…,n, thenThe OWA operator [43] is an aggregation operator that provides a parameterized family of aggregation operators between the minimum and the maximum, which can be defined as follows:Definition 4[43]. An OWA operator of dimension n is a mapping OWA:Rn→R that has an associated weighting vector w with∑j=1nwj=1and wj∈[0,1], such thatThe OWA operator is monotonic, commutative, bounded and idempotent. In [58], Yager extended the OWA to uncertain environment and obtained the COWA operator. It can be defined as follows:Definition 5[58]. A COWA operator is a mapping F:Ω→R+ associated with a basic unit interval monotonic (BUM) function Q, such thatIfλ=∫01Q(y)dyis the attitudinal character of Q, then a general formulation of FQ(a) can be obtained as follows [58]:(6)FQ(a)=FQ([aL,aU])=λaU+(1−λ)aL.As we can see, the COWA operator FQ(a) is always the weighted arithmetical mean of end points based on the attitudinal character. That is to say, the interval number [68]a can be replaced by FQ(a).In [63], Zhang and Xu extended the COWA operator to linguistic environment and obtained the linguistic COWA operator, which can be defined as follows.Definition 6[63]. Lets˜;=[sα,sβ]be an uncertain additive linguistic variable. IfIfλ=∫01Q(y)dyis the attitudinal character of Q, then the LCOWA operator can be written as follows:(9)fQ(s˜;)=fQ([sα,sβ])=sλβ+(1−λ)α=λsβ⊕(1−λ)sα.From Eq. (9), we can see that the LCOWA operator may be determined by the attitudinal character λ. The parameter λ, which lies in the interval [0,1], can be considered as the measure of the decision maker's attitudinal character. In the extreme case that λ=1, meaning that the decision make is very optimistic. On the other hand, a value of λ approaches zero indicates that the decision maker is very conservative. Therefore, in the decision making process, if decision maker is optimistic, then we can select the parameter λ→1, and if decision maker is pessimistic, then we can select the parameter λ→0. If decision maker is neutral, then we can select the parameter λ→0.5.For convenience, in this paper, we assume thatfλ(s˜;)denotesfQ(s˜;), i.e.,(10)fλ(s˜;)=fλ([sα,sβ])=λsβ⊕(1−λ)sα=sλβ+(1−λ)α.In the following, we will present a new compatibility index of uncertain additive linguistic preference relations based on the LCOWA operator. Then we shall study some desirable properties of the new compatibility index.Definition 7Lets˜;1=[sα1,sβ1],s˜;2=[sα2,sβ2]be two uncertain additive linguistic variables, and ifIt can be seen easily that the smaller the value ofCλ(s˜;1,s˜;2),the nearer the uncertain additive linguistic variabless˜;1ands˜;2will be. With Eq. (10),Cλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)can be expressed as follows:(12)Cλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)=12tI(sλβ1+(1−λ)α1)−I(sλβ2+(1−λ)α2)=12tλβ1+(1−λ)α1−(λβ2+(1−λ)α2),whereλ=∫01Q(y)dyis the attitudinal character of Q.From Definition 7, we can get the following theorem easily:Theorem 2Lets˜;1=[sα1,sβ1],s˜;2=[sα2,sβ2],s˜;3=[sα3,sβ3]be three uncertain additive linguistic variables, thenProof. (1) By Eq. (12), we haveCλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)=12tλβ1+(1−λ)α1−(λβ2+(1−λ)α2)≥0.(2) By Eq. (12), we obtainCλ(s˜;1,s˜;1)=12tλβ1+(1−λ)α1−(λβ1+(1−λ)α1)=0.(3) By Eq. (12), we getCλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)=12tλβ1+(1−λ)α1−(λβ2+(1−λ)α2)=12tλβ2+(1−λ)α2−(λβ1+(1−λ)α1)=Cλ(s˜;2,s˜;1).(4) IfCλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)=0andCλ(s˜;2,s˜;3)=0, then by Eq. (11), we haveI(fλ(s˜;1))=I(fλ(s˜;2))andI(fλ(s˜;2))=I(fλ(s˜;3)).Thus,I(fλ(s˜;1))=I(fλ(s˜;3)).That is to say,Cλ(s˜;1,s˜;3)=12tI(fλ(s˜;1))−I(fλ(s˜;3))=0.(5) By Eq. (11), we get thatCλ(s˜;1,s˜;3)=12tI(fλ(s˜;1))−I(fλ(s˜;3))=12tI(fλ(s˜;1))−I(fλ(s˜;2))+I(fλ(s˜;2))−I(fλ(s˜;3))≤12tI(fλ(s˜;1))−I(fλ(s˜;2))+I(fλ(s˜;2))−I(fλ(s˜;3))=12tI(fλ(s˜;1))−I(fλ(s˜;2))+12tI(fλ(s˜;2))−I(fλ(s˜;3))=Cλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)+Cλ(s˜;2,s˜;3).Definition 8Lets˜;1=[sα1,sβ1],s˜;2=[sα2,sβ2]be two uncertain additive linguistic variables. IfCλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)=0for all attitudinal character λ, thens˜;1ands˜;2are perfectly compatible. And ifCλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)=0for a given λ, thens˜;1ands˜;2are perfectly compatible with a given λ.Lets˜;1=[sα1,sβ1],s˜;2=[sα2,sβ2]be two uncertain additive linguistic variables, thens˜;1ands˜;2are perfectly compatible if and only ifs˜;1=s˜;2.Proof. Necessity. Ifs˜;1ands˜;2are perfectly compatible, then by Eq. (12), for all attitudinal character λ, we haveCλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)=0, i.e.,λβ1+(1−λ)α1−(λβ2+(1−λ)α2)=0.Let λ=1, then β1=β2. And let λ=0, then α1=α2. Thus,sα1=sα2andsβ1=sβ2,which means thats˜;1=s˜;2.Sufficiency. Ifs˜;1=s˜;2,thensα1=sα2andsβ1=sβ2, i.e., β1=β2 and α1=α2. Thus, for all attitudinal character λ, we have λβ1+(1−λ)α1−(λβ2+(1−λ)α2)=0. By Eq. (12), we haveCλ(s˜;1,s˜;2)=0.Therefore,s˜;1ands˜;2are perfectly compatible.Definition 9LetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈MnandB˜;=(b˜;ij)n×n∈Mnbe two uncertain additive linguistic preference relations, thenAs we can see, the compatibility degree of uncertain additive linguistic preference relationsA˜;andB˜;is the sum of compatibility degree of all the corresponding elements fromA˜;andB˜;,which reflects the total difference betweenA˜;andB˜;.By Eq. (11), Eq. (13) can be rewritten as follows:(14)Cλ(A˜;,B˜;)=12t∑i=1n∑j=1nI(fλ(a˜;ij))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)).Definition 10LetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈MnandB˜;=(b˜;ij)n×n∈Mnbe two uncertain additive linguistic preference relations. IfCλ(A˜;,B˜;)=0for all attitudinal character λ, thenA˜;andB˜;are perfectly compatible. And ifCλ(A˜;,B˜;)=0for a given λ, thenA˜;andB˜;are perfectly compatible with a given λ.It is obvious that we can obtain the following theorem from Theorem 3.Theorem 4LetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈MnandB˜;=(b˜;ij)n×n∈Mnbe two uncertain additive linguistic preference relations, thenA˜;andB˜;are perfectly compatible if and only ifa˜;ij=b˜;ij,i,j=1,2,…,n.Assume thatA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈Mn,B˜;=(b˜;ij)n×n∈MnandD˜;=(d˜;ij)n×n∈Mn,then we haveProof. (1) Based on Theorem 2, we getCλ(a˜;ij,b˜;ij)≥0for all i, j=1, 2, …, n, then by Eq. (13), we obtain thatCλ(A˜;,B˜;)=∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(a˜;ij,b˜;ij)≥0.(2) Based on Theorem 2, we getCλ(a˜;ij,a˜;ij)=0for all i, j=1, 2, …, n, then by Eq. (13), we haveCλ(A˜;,A˜;)=∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(a˜;ij,a˜;ij)=0.(3) Based on Theorem 2, we getCλ(a˜;ij,b˜;ij)=Cλ(b˜;ij,a˜;ij)for all i, j=1, 2, …, n, then by Eq. (13), we get thatCλ(A˜;,B˜;)=∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(a˜;ij,b˜;ij)=∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(b˜;ij,a˜;ij)=Cλ(B˜;,A˜;).(4) IfCλ(A˜;,B˜;)=0andCλ(B˜;,D˜;)=0,then by Eq. (13), we have thatCλ(A˜;,B˜;)=∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(a˜;ij,b˜;ij)=0,andCλ(B˜;,D˜;)=∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(b˜;ij,d˜;ij)=0.With the fact thatCλ(a˜;ij,b˜;ij)≥0andCλ(b˜;ij,d˜;ij)≥0,we getCλ(a˜;ij,b˜;ij)=0andCλ(b˜;ij,d˜;ij)=0, for all i, j=1, 2, …, n. Then by Theorem 2, we getCλ(a˜;ij,d˜;ij)=0for all i, j=1, 2, …, n. Therefore,Cλ(A˜;,D˜;)=∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(a˜;ij,d˜;ij)=0.(5) By Eq. (13) and Theorem 2, we obtainCλ(A˜;,D˜;)=∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(a˜;ij,d˜;ij)≤∑i=1n∑j=1n(Cλ(a˜;ij,b˜;ij)+Cλ(b˜;ij,d˜;ij))=∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(a˜;ij,b˜;ij)+∑i=1n∑j=1nCλ(b˜;ij,d˜;ij)=Cλ(A˜;,B˜;)+Cλ(B˜;,D˜;).Definition 11LetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈Mnbe an uncertain additive linguistic preference relation, wherea˜;ij=[a˜;ijL,a˜;ijU].If there existsA¯=(a¯ij)n×nsatisfyingFrom Eq. (15), we have that(16)a˜;ijL⊕a¯ijL=s0,a˜;ijU⊕a¯ijU=s0.Lemma 1Letsα,sβ,sγ∈S˜;.If sα⊕sβ=s0and sα⊕sγ=s0, then sβ=sγ.Proof. If sα⊕sβ=s0 and sα⊕sγ=s0, i.e., sα+β=s0 and sα+γ=s0, then α+β=0 and α+γ=0, which means that β=γ. Thus, sβ=sγ.Theorem 6IfA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈Mn,thenA¯=(a¯ij)n×n∈Mn,whereA¯is the complementary matrix of A.Proof. SinceA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈Mn,wherea˜;ij=[a˜;ijL,a˜;ijU].By Definition 3 and Lemma 1, we have(17)a˜;ijU⊕a˜;jiL=s0,a˜;ijL⊕a˜;jiU=s0,a˜;ijU=a˜;ijL=s0,∀i,j=1,2,…,n.By Eq. (16), we obtaina¯ijL=a˜;jiU,a¯ijU=a˜;jiL,∀i,j=1,2,…,n,anda¯jiL=a˜;ijU,a¯jiU=a˜;ijL,∀i,j=1,2,…,n.Thus,a¯ijL⊕a¯jiU=a˜;jiU⊕a˜;ijL=s0anda¯ijU⊕a¯jiL=a˜;jiL⊕a˜;ijU=s0.From Definition 2, we can see thatA¯=(a¯ij)n×n∈Mn,which completes the proof.Theorem 7LetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈Mn,B˜;=(b˜;ij)n×n∈Mn.IfA¯=(a¯ij)n×nandB¯=(b¯ij)n×nare complementary matrices ofA˜;andB˜;,respectively, thenProof. SinceA¯=(a¯ij)n×nandB¯=(b¯ij)n×nare complementary matrices ofA˜;andB˜;,respectively, we have(19)a¯ijL=a˜;jiU,a¯ijU=a˜;jiL,∀i,j=1,2,…,n,and(20)b¯ijL=b˜;jiU,b¯ijU=b˜;jiL,∀i,j=1,2,…,n.Then by Eqs. (10), (19) and (20), we getfλ(a¯ij)=λa¯ijU⊕(1−λ)a¯ijL=λa˜;jiL⊕(1−λ)a˜;jiU=f1−λ(a˜;ji),andfλ(b¯ij)=λb¯ijU⊕(1−λ)b¯ijL=λb˜;jiL⊕(1−λ)b˜;jiU=f1−λ(b˜;ji).By Eq. (14), we have thatCλ(A¯,B¯)=12t∑i=1n∑j=1nI(fλ(a¯ij))−I(fλ(b¯ij))=12t∑i=1n∑j=1nI(f1−λ(a˜;ji))−I(f1−λ(b˜;ji))=12t∑j=1n∑i=1nI(f1−λ(a˜;ji))−I(f1−λ(b˜;ji))=12t∑i=1n∑j=1nI(f1−λ(a˜;ij))−I(f1−λ(b˜;ij))=C1−λ(A˜;,B˜;).Theorem 7 shows the relation between the compatibility ofA˜;,B˜;and the compatibility of their complementary matricesA˜;,B˜;.Definition 12LetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈MnandB˜;=(b˜;ij)n×n∈Mn,thenIt can be seen that the compatibility indexCIλ(A˜;,B˜;)represents the average difference betweenA˜;andB˜;.Moreover, it can be seen that from Eqs. (12), (14) and (21), the compatibility degree and compatibility index can deal with the compatibility of all the arguments in two uncertain additive linguistic variables by using a controlled parameter considering the attitude of decision maker rather than the compatibility of the simply two points in linguistic intervals, which is the main advantage of compatibility degree and compatibility index of uncertain additive linguistic preference relations.By Definition 12 and Theorem 5, we can get the following conclusions.Theorem 8LetA˜;,B˜;∈Mn,thenLetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈MnandB˜;=(b˜;ij)n×n∈Mn.IfAs illustrated in [27,36], we can take α=0.1 as the threshold of acceptable compatibility.Let D={d1, d2, …, dm} be a finite set of experts andA˜;(k)=(a˜;ij(k))n×n∈Mnbe the uncertain additive linguistic preference relation provided by expert dk, k=1,2,…,m, then we can get the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relation ofA˜;(1),A˜;(2),…,A˜;(m)as follows:Definition 14[36]. LetA˜;(k)=(a˜;ij(k))n×n∈Mnfor k=1, 2, …, m. IfIn [36], Chen, Zhou and Han developed the property of the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relation as follows:Theorem 9[36]. LetA˜;(k)=(a˜;ij(k))n×nbe uncertain additive linguistic preference relations for k=1,2,…,m, then the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relationA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×nis also an uncertain additive linguistic preference relation.LetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈Mnfor k=1,2,…,m, andB˜;=(b˜;ij)n×n∈Mn. IfCIλ(A˜;(k),B˜;)≤α,for all k=1,2,…,m, thenProof. By Definition 14, we have thata˜;ijU=ω1a˜;ij(1)U⊕ω2a˜;ij(2)U⊕⋯⊕ωma˜;ij(m)U,anda˜;ijL=ω1a˜;ij(1)L⊕ω2a˜;ij(2)L⊕⋯⊕ωma˜;ij(m)L,where ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωm) is the weighting vector of m experts, which satisfies that ωk≥0 for all j=1, 2, …, m and∑k=1mωk=1.Then by Eq. (10), we getfλ(a˜;ij)=λa˜;ijU⊕(1−λ)a˜;ijL=λ(ω1a˜;ij(1)U⊕ω2a˜;ij(2)U⊕⋯⊕ωma˜;ij(m)U)+(1−λ)(ω1a˜;ij(1)L⊕ω2a˜;ij(2)L⊕⋯⊕ωma˜;ij(m)L)=ω1(λa˜;ij(1)U⊕(1−λ)a˜;ij(1)L)⊕⋯⊕ωm(λa˜;ij(m)U⊕(1−λ)a˜;ij(m)L)=ω1fλ(a˜;ij(1))⊕⋯⊕ωmfλ(a˜;ij(m)).With Theorem 1, we obtain thatI(fλ(a˜;ij))=I(ω1fλ(a˜;ij(1))⊕⋯⊕ωmfλ(a˜;ij(m)))=∑k=1mωkI(fλ(a˜;ij(k))).SinceCIλ(A˜;(k),B˜;)≤α,by Eqs. (14) and (21), we getCIλ(A˜;(k),B˜;)=12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n|I(fλ(a˜;ij(k)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))|≤α.Thus, according to Definition 14, we obtain thatCIλ(A˜;,B˜;)=12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n|I(fλ(a˜;ij))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))|=12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n∑k=1mωkI(fλ(a˜;ij(k)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))=12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n∑k=1mωk(I(fλ(a˜;ij(k)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)))≤12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n∑k=1mωkI(fλ(a˜;ij(k)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))=∑k=1mωk12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1nI(fλ(a˜;ij(k)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))=∑k=1mωkCIλ(A˜;(k),B˜;)≤∑k=1mωkα=α.Corollary 1LetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈Mnfor k=1, 2, …, m, andB˜;=(b˜;ij)n×n∈Mn.IfCIλ(A˜;(k),B˜;)=0,for all k=1, 2, …, m, thenAs is well known, the less compatibility index of uncertain additive linguistic preference relations given by the expert dk, the more reliable information provided by the expert dk. In order to determine the weights of experts, we can minimize the compatibility index of the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relationA˜;and the ideal uncertain linguistic preference relationB˜;based on the LCOWA operator.For the convenience of calculation, we can use the square sum instead of absolute values in compatibility index of the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relationA˜;and the ideal uncertain linguistic preference relationB˜;.Therefore, based on the proof of Theorem 10, the compatibility index ofA˜;andB˜;can be rewritten as follows:CIλ(A˜;,B˜;)=12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n(I(fλ(a˜;ij))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)))2=12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n∑k=1mωk(I(fλ(a˜;ij(k)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)))2=12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n∑k1=1mωk1(I(fλ(a˜;ij(k1)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)))×∑k2=1mωk2(I(fλ(a˜;ij(k2)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)))=∑k1=1m∑k2=1mωk2ωk112tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n((I(fλ(a˜;ij(k1)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)))×(I(fλ(a˜;ij(k2)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))))LetE=(ek1k2)m×m,where(26)ek1k2=12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n((I(fλ(a˜;ij(k1)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)))×(I(fλ(a˜;ij(k2)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)))),∀k1,k2=1,2,…,m.And let ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωm) be the experts’ weighting vector. Then the compatibility indexCIλ(A˜;,B˜;)can be regarded as the function of ω. Denotingg(ω)=CIλ(A˜;,B˜;), we get(27)g(ω)=ωTEω.Therefore, we can construct the following optimal model to determine experts’ weights by minimizing the compatibility index of uncertain additive linguistic preference relations based on the LCOWA operator:(28)Ming(ω)=ωTEωs.t.∑k=1mωk=1,ωk≥0,k=1,2,…,m.Letting RT=(1, 1, …, 1)1×m, we have(29)Ming(ω)=ωTEωs.t.RTω=1,ω≥0.It is obvious that the model (29), approach to determine weights of experts based on the criterion of minimizing the compatibility index, can measure the reliability of information given by different experts with more theoretic basis in group decision making.If the constraint ω≥0 is not taken into account, Eq. (29) can be viewed as follows:(30)Ming(ω)=ωTEωs.t.RTω=1.It follows that if the global optimal solution to model (30) ω*≥0, then ω* is also the global optimal solution to model (29).Theorem 11IfA˜;andB˜;are not perfectly compatible for a given attitudinal character λ, then the optimal solution to Eq.(30)isProof. Since for a given attitudinal character λ,A˜;andB˜;are not perfectly compatible, there exists i0, j0∈{1, 2, …, n}, which satisfy(I(fλ(a˜;i0j0))−I(fλ(b˜;i0j0)))2>0.Thus,g(ω)=ωTEω=12tn2∑i=1n∑j=1n(I(fλ(a˜;ij))−I(fλ(b˜;ij)))2>0.By Eq. (26), we getek1k2=ek2k1,∀k1,k2=1,2,…,m.Therefore,E=(ek1k2)m×mis a nonsingular matrix. By constructing the Lagrange function corresponding to the model of Eq. (30):(32)L(ω,μ)=ωTEω+μ(RTω−1),where μ is the Lagrange multiplier.Taking the partial derivatives of Eq. (32) with respect to ω and μ, and setting them to be equal to 0, we obtain that(33)∂L(ω,μ)∂ω=0,∂L(ω,μ)∂μ=0.By solving Eq. (33), we getω*=E−1RRTE−1R.With the fact that ∂2L(ω, μ)/∂ω2=2E, which means that g(ω) is a strictly convex function, ω* is the unique optimal solution to Eq. (30), which completes the proof of the theorem.Note that the model (29) is nonlinear and can be solved by using Matlab or LINGO software package.In this section, we shall present a new approach based on the compatibility index to group decision making with uncertain additive linguistic preference relations.We firstly define an expected additive linguistic preference relation by using Eqs. (7) and (8) as follows:Definition 15LetA˜;=(a˜;ij)n×n∈Mn,whereConsider a GDM problem. Let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be a set of finite alternatives and D={d1, d2, …, dm} be a finite set of experts. Each expert provides his/her own decision matrixA˜;(k)=(a˜;ij(k))n×n,which is uncertain additive linguistic preference relation provided by the expert dk∈D. The process of new approach can be summarized as follows:Step 1Utilize the model (29) or Theorem 11 to determine the optimal weights of experts:Utilize Eq. (23) to obtain the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relation [39]A˜;*=(a˜;ij*)n×nbased on the optimal weights of experts, whereUtilize Eq. (34) to construct the expected additive linguistic preference relationfλ(A˜;*)=(fλ(a˜;ij*))n×nbased on the LCOWA operator:Calculate the expected valuea˜;i*of preference degree of the alternative xito all the alternatives by the following formula [17]:Rank the expected valuea˜;i*(i=1,2,…,n)in descending order.Rank all the alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, n) and select the best one(s) in accordance with the expected valuea˜;i*(i=1,2,…,n).End.In this section, we develop an approach for evaluating four schools of a university (adapted from [27,36]). Let X={x1, x2, x3, x4} be a finite set four schools to be evaluated. The group of company experts is constituted by four persons. Each expert dk(k=1, 2, 3, 4) compares four schools with respect to the main criterion of research by using the following additive linguistic scales:S={s−5=EP,s−4=DP,s−3=SP,s−2=MP,s−1=WP,s0=EG,s1=WG,s2=MG,s3=SG,s4=DG,s5=EG}.Note that EP=extremely poor, DP=demonstratedly poor, SP=strongly poor, MP=moderately poor, WP=weakly poor, EG=equally good, WG=weakly good, MG=moderately good, SG=strongly good, DG=demonstratedly good, EG=extremely good.Assume thatB˜;is the ideal uncertain additive linguistic preference relations provided by the group and each expert gives his/her own uncertain additive linguistic preference relationA˜;(k)(k=1,2,3,4), respectively. They are listed as follows:B˜;=[s0,s0][s0,s2][s2,s5][s−3,s−2][s−2,s0][s0,s0][s0,s3][s−3,s0][s−5,s−2][s−3,s0][s0,s0][s3,s5][s2,s3][s0,s3][s−5,s−3][s0,s0];A˜;(1)=[s0,s0][s1,s2][s1,s3][s−2,s0][s−2,s−1][s0,s0][s0,s2][s−3,s−2][s−3,s−1][s−2,s0][s0,s0][s2,s3][s0,s2][s2,s3][s−3,s−2][s0,s0];A˜;(2)=[s0,s0][s−2,s0][s0,s5][s−3,s0][s0,s2][s0,s0][s0,s2][s−2,s0][s−5,s0][s−2,s0][s0,s0][s2,s5][s0,s3][s0,s2][s−5,s−2][s0,s0];A˜;(3)=[s0,s0][s1,s4][s3,s5][s−5,s−3][s−4,s−1][s0,s0][s1,s3][s−3,s−1][s−5,s−3][s−3,s−1][s0,s0][s3,s5][s3,s5][s1,s3][s−5,s−3][s0,s0];A˜;(4)=[s0,s0][s−2,s0][s3,s4][s−2,s−1][s0,s2][s0,s0][s−2,s0][s−3,s0][s−4,s−3][s0,s2][s0,s0][s2,s5][s1,s2][s0,s3][s−5,s−2][s0,s0].With this information, we can use the proposed approach to get the ranking of the alternatives. Note that in this case, we assume that Q(y)=y2, thenλ=∫01Q(y)dy=1/3.The following steps are involved:Step 1Utilize Theorem 11 to determine the optimal weights of experts and obtainUtilize Eq. (35) to obtain the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relationA˜;*=(a˜;ij*)n×nbased on the optimal weights of experts, whereObviously, the matrixA˜;*is the uncertain additive linguistic preference relation, which verifies Theorem 9.Step 3Utilize Eq. (36) to construct the expected additive linguistic preference relationfλ(A˜;*)=(fλ(a˜;ij*))n×nbased on the LCOWA operator:Calculate the expected valuea˜;i*of preference degree of the alternative xito all the alternatives by Eq. (37):Rank the expected valuea˜;i*(i=1,2,3,4)in descending order:Rank all the alternatives xi(i=1, 2, 3, 4) in accordance with the expected valuea˜;i*:Note that “≻” means “preferred to.”Moreover, according to Eqs. (14) and (21), we get the compatibility indexes ofA˜;(k)(k=1,2,3,4)andB˜;:CIλ(A˜;(1),B˜;)=12×5×42∑i=14∑j=14I(fλ(a˜;ij(1)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))=0.08125.CIλ(A˜;(2),B˜;)=12×5×42∑i=14∑j=14I(fλ(a˜;ij(2)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))=0.06875.CIλ(A˜;(3),B˜;)=12×5×42∑i=14∑j=14I(fλ(a˜;ij(3)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))=0.05625.CIλ(A˜;(4),B˜;)=12×5×42∑i=14∑j=14I(fλ(a˜;ij(4)))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))=0.07917.Letting α=0.1, thenCIλ(A˜;(k),B˜;)≤α,k=1,2,3,4.As we can see that the uncertain additive linguistic preference relationsA˜;(k)andB˜;are of acceptable compatibility.But with Eqs. (14) and (21), we haveCIλ(A˜;*,B˜;)=12×5×42∑i=14∑j=14I(fλ(a˜;ij*))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))=0.0143.It can be seen easily thatCIλ(A˜;*,B˜;)<α,which means thatA˜;*and B are of acceptable compatibility. Moreover, we can see thatCIλ(A˜;*,B˜;)<CIλ(A˜;(k),B˜;),k=1,2,3,4,which means that the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relationA˜;*is more ideal thanA˜;(k)for k=1, 2, 3, 4. The result demonstrates that Theorem 10 is accurate and efficient.Furthermore, in order to analyze how the different weights of experts have affection for the compatibility index, in this example, we consider the equal experts’ weights, i.e., ωk=1/4 for k=1, 2, 3, 4. Then the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relationAˆ=(aˆij)4×4is calculated as follows:Aˆ=[s0,s0][s−0.5,s1.5][s1.75,s4.25][s−3,s−1][s−1.5,s0.5][s0,s0][s−0.25,s1.75][s−2.75,s−0.75][s−4.25,s−1.75][s−1.75,s0.25][s0,s0][s2.25,s4.5][s1,s3][s0.75,s2.75][s−4.5,s−2.25][s0,s0].Therefore,CIλ(Aˆ,B˜;)=12×5×42∑i=14∑j=14|I(fλ(aˆij))−I(fλ(b˜;ij))|=0.03906.Thus, we haveCIλ(A˜;*,B˜;)<CIλ(Aˆ,B˜;),which shows that the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relation corresponding to the optimal experts’ weights based on minimization of compatibility index is superior to that of equal experts’ weights.Moreover, it is possible to analyze how the different attitudinal character λ plays a role in the aggregation results, in this case, we consider different value of λ: 0, 0.01, 0.02, …, 0.99, 1, which are provided by the decision makers. The results of experts’ weights by model (29) or Eq. (31) are shown in Fig. 1.It is observed from Fig. 1 that ω2 and ω3 first increase and then decrease as λ increases, while ω1 and ω4 first decrease and then increase as λ increases.The results ofa˜;i*(i=1,2,3,4)are shown in Fig. 2and the values ofCIλ(A˜;*,B˜;)are shown in Fig. 3.From Fig. 2, we can see that depending on the particular cases of the attitudinal character λ used, the ordering of the schools is different, thus resulting in different decisions. However, it seems that x4 is the best choice when λ<0.43, and x1 sometimes is also the best one.We also can see that the experts’ weights, the values ofa˜;i*and the values of compatibility index are symmetric with respect to the attitudinal character, which are caused by Eq. (31).It is evidently that decision maker can make decision by choosing different value of the parameter λ with his/her attitude, which is superior to the traditional approaches. Another benefit of this approach is the low computational complexity and obvious global maximum. If λ ranges from 0 to 1, then by using LINGO 11.0, total solver iterations all are less than 160, and the elapsed runtime all are 0.00. Therefore, it is suitable for real-time processing and computing in group decision making.In this paper, we have presented the compatibility degree and the compatibility index of two uncertain additive linguistic preference relations based on the LCOWA operator, which can parameterize the results according to the attitude of the experts by using the attitudinal character in the LCOWA operator. We have investigated some desirable properties of the compatibility index. Especially, we have proved that the synthetic uncertain linguistic preference relationA˜;and the ideal uncertain linguistic preference relationB˜;are of acceptable compatibility under the condition thatA˜;(k)provided by expert dk(k=1,2,…,m) andB˜;are of acceptable compatibility, which is the prominent characteristic of using the uncertain additive linguistic preference relations in GDM. We further have proposed the optimal model to determine the experts’ weights by minimizing the compatibility index in GDM with the uncertain additive linguistic preference relations. An illustrative example has shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the experts’ weights approach compared with the equal experts’ weights. In future, we expect to develop some applications with the compatibility of linguistic preference relations. For example, we can apply the compatibility of preference relations to linguistic steganography [69,70].
