This paper presents a novel finite element model for the fully material and geometrical nonlinear analysis of shear-deformable two-layer composite planar beam/column members with interlayer slips. We adopt the co-rotational approach where the motion of the element is decomposed into two parts: a rigid body motion which defines a local co-ordinate system and a small deformational motion of the element relative to this local co-ordinate system. The main advantage of this approach is that the transformation matrices relating local and global quantities are independent from the choice of the geometrical linear local element. The effect of transverse shear deformation of the layers is taken into account by assuming that each layer behaves as a Timoshenko beam element. The layers are assumed to be continuously connected and partial interaction is considered by adopting a continuous relationship between the interface shear flow and the corresponding slip. In order to avoid curvature and the shear locking phenomena, the local linear element is derived from the force-based formulation. The present model provides an efficient tool for the elastoplastic buckling analysis of two-layer shear deformable beam/column with arbitrary support and loading conditions. Finally, two numerical applications are presented in order to assess the performance of the proposed formulation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Two-layer composite members are often used in civil engineering. Two typical examples are steel–concrete beams and nailed timber members. For these applications, a complete shear layer interaction cannot be obtained and a relative displacement of adjacent layers occurs. Whereas the transverse separation is often small and can be neglected; the slip tangent to the interface surface influences the behavior of the composite beam and must be considered.Several theoretical models, characterized by different levels of approximation, have been proposed for the geometrically linear analysis of elastic composite structures. To the best knowledge of the authors, the earliest and most cited work on the partial interaction of composite beams is due to Newmark et al. in 1951 [1] and it is based on the small deformation elastic analysis considering Euler–Bernoulli׳s beam theory for representing the deformation of beam layers. Since then, this model was extensively used by many authors to formulate analytical models for the static response of linear elastic [2–7] as well as linear-viscoelastic [8–12] of composite beams with arbitrary support and loading conditions. In addition, several numerical models based on the same basic assumptions have been developed to investigate the behavior of composite beams with partial interaction in the nonlinear range (for material nonlinearities, see e.g. [13–17], and for geometric nonlinearities, see e.g. [18–20]). The most significant advances in the theory of two-layer beams in partial interaction moved recently toward the introduction of shear flexibility of both layers according to the well-known Timoshenko theory (see e.g. [21–35]).The two-layer members with interlayer slips may develop nonlinear geometrical and material behavior, even for small deformations. In contrast with the large body of literature devoted to material nonlinear and geometrical linear problems of shear deformable layered beam/columns in partial interaction, only a few numerical models which consider both material and geometrical nonlinearities, the interlayer slip and cross-section shear flexibility can be found in the literature. Recently, Hozjan et al. [36] developed a FE model for two-layer beam/column based on the shear-stiff Reissner beam theory. This model takes into account the exact geometrical (Total Lagrangian approach) and material nonlinearities as well as finite slip between the layers. However, the transverse shear deformation is neglected. They developed the fundamental equations of the problem which exactly account for the equilibrium between the contact surfaces of the layers in the deformed state as well as for the tangential separation of layers at the edges. These equations were then cast into the discretized weak form by the modified principle of virtual work using the unconventional finite element technique.The purpose of this paper is to present a novel finite element model for the fully material and geometrical nonlinear analysis of shear-deformable two-layer composite planar beams with interlayer slips. The effect of transverse shear is taken into account using Timoshenko׳s beam theory. A co-rotational description is used, which means that the motion of the element is decomposed into two parts: a rigid body motion which defines a local co-ordinate system and a small deformational motion of the element relative to this local co-ordinate system. The geometrical nonlinearity induced by the large rigid-body motion, is incorporated in the transformation matrices relating local and global internal force vectors and tangent stiffness matrices whereas the deformational response, captured at the level of the local co-ordinate system, is assumed to be small and modeled using a geometrical linear element. The main advantage of the co-rotational approach is that the transformation matrices relating local and global quantities are independent to the choice of the local linear geometrical element. A second advantage of this approach is the separation between geometrical and material nonlinearities. The local formulation is based on the force-based approach. This choice is motivated by the fact that shear and curvature locking can be avoided. Furthermore, force-based EF is known for being more effective in dealing with material nonlinear problems [13]. The present model provides an efficient tool for elastoplastic buckling analysis of two-layer shear deformable beam with arbitrary support and loading conditions. The main contribution of the present paper is the incorporation of shear deformation of the layers which allows for a more general treatment of two-layer beams with interlayer slip. This extension adds complexity to the treatment of large displacement of layered beams within a co-rotational formulation. Indeed, the independent shearing of the different layers results in independent cross-section rotation of the layers and so in extra degree of freedom which necessarily modifies the FE formulation itself.Let us consider a planar composite beam element with two layers of possibly different cross-sections and materials and including shear connectors at the interface which are uniformly distributed along the longitudinal direction, as shown inFig. 1. It is assumed that the interlayer slip can occur at the interface but there is no uplift. In order to take into account the transverse shear effect, the first-order shear deformation beam theory of Timoshenko is used.The co-ordinates of the nodes a1 and a2 in the global co-ordinate system(x,y)are(xa1,ya1)and(xa2,ya2), respectively. For instant, these nodes are chosen to be at the layer interface in order to derive easily the kinematic relationships between the global nodal displacements and the local ones. The general case of eccentric nodes will be treated in Section 3.3.The element has 10 global degrees of freedom in the fixed global co-ordinate system(x,y)(cf. Fig. 1). The vectors of global nodal displacements and forces are defined by(1)pg=[ua1ub1va1θa1θb1ua2ub2va2θa2θb2]TDue to the presence of the three rigid body modes in the global co-ordinate system, the corresponding element stiffness matrix is singular. Consequently, in general there is no flexibility matrix associated with this global system. For this reason, the proposed force-based element is formulated in the local system(xl,yl)without rigid body modes which translates and rotates with the element as the deformation proceeds. In this local system, the element has seven degree of freedoms and the vector of local displacements is defined as(2)pl=[u¯a2u¯b1u¯b2θ¯a1θ¯b1θ¯a2θ¯b2]Twhereu¯a2is the axial displacement of layera;θ¯m1andθ¯m2(m=a,b)are the end rotations of layerm. These relative displacements correspond to the minimum number of geometric variables necessary to describe the deformation modes of the element.In our work, a co-rotational (CR) approach is adopted to take into account geometric nonlinearity. This approach is a priori based on the kinematic assumptions: displacements and rotations may be arbitrarily large, but deformations must be small. The main advantage of this approach is that the formulation of the element in the local basic system is completely independent of the transformation, i.e. in the local system the element can be formulated as geometrically linear and the geometric nonlinearity can be introduced in the transformation.The idea of the co-rotational approach is to decompose the motion of the element into rigid body and pure deformational parts, through the use of a local basic system(xl,yl)which continuously rotates and translates with the element (see Fig. 1). The origin of the local co-ordinate system is taken at node a1 and thexl-axis of the local co-ordinate system is defined by the line connecting the nodes a1 and a2. Theyl-axis is perpendicular to thexl-axis so that the result is a right handed orthogonal co-ordinate system. The motion of the element from the original undeformed configuration to the actual deformed one can thus be separated in two parts. The first one, which corresponds to the rigid motion of the local frame, is described by the translation of the node a1 and the rigid rotation of the axes. The deformational part of the motion is always small relative to the local co-ordinate system and a geometrical linear element will be used. The co-rotational method for 2D beams is known for many years. However, when considering composite beams with interlayer slips, it is necessary to select pertinent kinematical local and global variables.According to the notations defined in Fig. 1, the components of the local displacement vectorplcan be computed from those of the global vectorpgas(3)θ¯a1=θa1−(β−β0)(4)θ¯b1=θb1−(β−β0)(5)θ¯a2=θa2−(β−β0)(6)θ¯b2=θb2−(β−β0)(7)u¯a2=ln−l0(8)u¯b1=g1cosθ¯1(9)u¯b2=u¯a2+g2cosθ¯2wherel0andlnare, respectively, the undeformed and the deformed element length defined as(10)l0=(xa2−xa1)2+(ya2−ya1)2(11)ln=(xa2+ua2−xa1−ua1)2+(ya2+va2−ya1−va1)2g1andg2denote the global slips at interface which are assumed to be perpendicular to the average cross-section rotations.

Note thatflandKldepend only on the definition of the local strains and not on the particular form of Eq. (13). The transformation matrixBlgbetween the local and global displacements is defined by(14)δpl=Blgδpgand is obtained by differentiation of Eq. (13).

However, in general the kinematic and static boundary conditions would be arbitrary. In order to make the present formulation able to cover any case of prescribed displacements, a change of degrees of freedom at the global level must be performed.Let us consider the general case where the prescribed displacements are applied at the nodesa^1,a^2,b^1andb^2which are located randomly over the cross-section of the element ends as illustrated inFig. 2.

The centroidal axis of the layer a is taken as the beam reference axis. The layers can slip one on the other but no separation can occur at the interlayer. It is also assumed that the cross-sections do not distort in their own planes. The shear deformation is taken into account by considering the first-order shear deformation theory of Timoshenko for each layer. Therefore, in the local system, two layers have the same transversal displacement but different rotations and curvatures. In the local system, rotations and displacements are considered to be small. Based on the above assumptions, the axial, shear and flexural deformations at the layer centroid are related to the displacements as follows:(32)u(x,y)=[ua(x,y)ub(x,y)v(x,y)]=[ua(x)−yθa(x)ub(x)−yθb(x)v(x)]whereua(x)andv(x)are, respectively, the axial and the transverse displacement of the reference axis;θi(x)is the rotation of the cross-sectioni(=aorb).The interlayer slipg(x)is defined as the relative axial displacement at the interface of layer b compared to layer a(33)g(x)=ub(x)−ua(x)For the sake of simplicity,(x)is now omitted in all functions ofx. As the deformations are assumed to be small compared to unity in the local co-ordinate, the quadratic part of the Green–Lagrange tensor is negligible compared to the linear part. One obtains(34)εa,xx=ua′−yθa′γa,xy=v′−θaεb,xx=ub′−yθb′γb,xy=v′−θbwhere the prime denotes the differentiation with respect tox. We denotee^vector of generalized section strains which is related to the cross-section deformations by the kinematic relations as(35)e^(d)=[u′aθ′av′−θau′bθ′bv′−θbub−ua]The conjugate internal force (stress resultant) vectorDcan be defined as(36)D=[NaMaTaNbMbTbDsc]TwhereNi,MiandTiare, respectively, the axial force, the bending moment and the shear force of the layeri(=aorb)at a given cross-section of co-ordinatex(37)Ni=∫Aiσi,xxdAiMi=−∫Aiyσi,xxdAiTi=∫Aiτi,xydAiandDscis the bond force at the interface.The equations of equilibrium which are consistent with the kinematic hypothesis stated in Section 4.2, can be obtained from the Principle of Virtual Work which is written as(38)∫LDTe^(δd)dx−flTδpl=0wheree^(δd)is the vector of generalized section strains derived from the virtual displacement fieldδdvia the compatibility Eq. (35);fl=[Q¯1Q¯2Q¯3Q¯4Q¯5Q¯6Q¯7]Tis the vector of end forces conjugated to the vector of local displacementspl(see Fig. 1). Note that for simplicity׳s sake, the element distributed loads (body forces) are omitted in the above expression.Eq. (38) is rewritten in the expanded form as(39)∫L[∑i=a,b(Niδu′i+Miδθ′i+Ti(δv′−δθi))+Dsc(δub−δua)]dx−flTδpl=0Applying integration by parts, the above equation is rewritten as(40)∫L[(N′a+Dsc)δua+(N′b−Dsc)δub+(M′a+Ta)δθa+(M′b+Tb)δθb+(T′a+T′b)δv]dx=[Naδua+Nbδub+Maδθa+Mbδθb+(Ta+Tb)δv]0L−flTδplThe above equation must be fulfilled for all kinematically admissible variationsδui,δvandδθii(=aorb)satisfying the essential boundary conditionsδua(0)=δv(0)=δv(L)resulting in the following equilibrium equations being obtained:(41)N′a+Dsc=0N′b−Dsc=0M′a+Ta=0M′b+Tb=0T′a+T′b=0}in[0,L]with the following natural boundary conditions:(42)Na(L)=Q¯1;Nb(0)=−Q¯2;Nb(L)=Q¯3Ma(0)=−Q¯4;Mb(0)=−Q¯5;Ma(L)=Q¯6;Mb(L)=Q¯7In a force-based FE formulation, the internal forces are expressed in term of end forces by using force interpolation functions. For the regular beam which is statically determinate, the force interpolation functions, obtained from equilibrium, represent the exact distribution of internal forces along the beam. However, the composite beam in partial interaction is internally indeterminate. This can be seen from the equilibrium equation (41) where there are only five equations for seven unknowns. The exact distribution of internal forces is indeed not available, except for some special cases with linear elastic behavior [25]. The number of compatibility conditions is equal to the degree of indeterminacy. However, in our case, the number of compatibility conditions is infinity because of continuous problem. Therefore, some approximations are required to overcome this indeterminacy. In the present formulation, the axial forceNband the bending momentMbare treated as redundant forces and are linearly interpolated. Moreover,NbandMbmust satisfy the natural boundary conditions (42) thus they can be expressed as(43)Nb=(xL−1)Q¯2+xLQ¯3Mb=(xL−1)Q¯5+xLQ¯7Substituting these expressions into the equilibrium equation (41) and then applying the natural boundary conditions (42), one obtains a relation between internal forcesDand end forcesplwhich can be written in matrix form as(44)D=bplwhere(45)b=1L[LL−xL−x0000000x−L0x0000−10−100x−LxL00000000x−L0x0000−10−10−1−10000]is the matrix of force interpolation functions. Note that in this approach the equilibrium equations are satisfied pointwise (strong form). This is in contrast to the displacement-based formulation where the equilibrium equations are satisfied in the average sense (weak form).The relation between internal forcesDand generalized strainsedepends on the material properties and the cross-section geometry of the beam. For two-layer beam in partial interaction with nonlinear material behavior, this relation can be expressed in general form as(46)D=Ω(e)whereΩrepresents a general function that permits the computation of internal forces for given generalized strains. The linearization of Eq. (46) is obtained using the tangent section stiffness matrix which is given as(47)kt=[ka,t000kb,t000ksc,t]whereksc,tis the tangent shear bond stiffness;ki,tdenotes the tangent section stiffness of layeri(=aorb), given as(48)ki,t=[∫AiEi,tdA−∫AiEi,tydA0−∫AiEi,tydA∫AiEi,ty2dA000∫AikisEi,tdA]withEi,t=∂σi,xx∂εi,xxGi,t=∂τi,xy∂γi,xyandkisis the shear factor that depends on the cross-section shape of layeri.The section tangent flexibility matrixft, necessary in the force-based formulation, is obtained by inverting the tangent section stiffness matrixkt. Finally, the linearized force–deformation relation for two-layer beam in partial interaction can be expressed as(49)ej≃ej−1+Δej=ej−1+ftj−1(Dj−D^j−1)wherejdenotes the element current Newton–Raphson state;D^j−1denotes the section resisting forces obtained through the strain driven constitutive equations at the statej−1. In the present formulation, to evaluate the integrals of Eq. (48) for cross-sections with arbitrary geometry, they are subdivided into regions of regular shapes, over which the Gauss–Lobatto quadrature integration rule is employed. Note that this method is more accurate that the fiber method which usually uses the midpoint integration rule [37].The weak form of the compatibility between the deformations derived from the implicit element displacements equation (35) and the corresponding deformations derived from the internal forces via the constitutive law equation (46) may be expressed as(50)∫L{∑i=a,b[δNiu′i+δMiθ′i+δTi(v′−θi)]+δDsc(ub−ua)−δDTe}dx=0whereδD=[δNaδMaδTaδNbδMbδTbδDsc]Tare the weighting functions that satisfy the differential equations of equilibrium (41) and they are chosen asδD=bδplwithbdefined in Eq. (45).Applying integration by parts and considering the kinematic boundary conditions, the above equation is rewritten as(51)δflTpl=∫LδDTedx+∫L[δN′a+δDscδN′b−δDscδM′a+δTaδM′b+δTbδT′a+δT′b]T[uaubθaθbv]dxThis equation is satisfied for all statically admissible variationsδD. Therefore, the second term on the right hand side of Eq. (51) is equal to zero. Furthermore, substituting from Eq. (44) into Eq. (51), the following expression is obtained:(52)δflTpl=δflT∫LbTedxSinceδflis a vector of arbitrary virtual forces, Eq. (52) must be valid for all values ofδfl. Therefore, this equation may be simplified in the following form:(53)pl=∫LbTedxThis equation, which represents element compatibility equations, allows for the determination of the element end displacements in term of section deformations along the element.Using the linearized force–deformation relation (49) and Eq. (44), Eq. (53) can be expanded about the current element statejas follows:(54)Ftj−1Δflj=Δplj+p˜lj−1where(55)Ftj−1=∫LbTftj−1bdxis the element tangent flexibility matrix; and(56)p˜lj−1=plj−1−∫LbT(ej−1+ftj−1(Dj−1−D^j−1))dxrepresents the element nodal displacements due to the lack of compatibility at the element level.In order to use the present formulation in the general co-rotational framework, the flexibility matrixFtj−1must be inverted to obtain the element stiffness matrixKtj−1at the end of the last iteration. As the present local formulation is derived for the element with rigid body modes thereforeFtj−1can be directly inverted and Eq. (54) can be rewritten as(57)Ktj−1Δplj=Δflj−f˜lj−1where(58)f˜lj−1=[Ftj−1]−1p˜lj−1=Ktj−1p˜lj−1In a standard displacement-based formulation, the state determination is a strain-driven process, i.e., the stresses are obtained from the strains which are computed from the element displacements through the deformation shape functions. This is a sharp contrast with force-based formulation where there are no interpolation functions to relate the section deformations to the deformation field inside the element to the end node displacements. Therefore, the state determination procedure for a force-based element is not straightforward and more complicated. In the present model, the state determination procedure developed for regular beam/column developed by Spacone et al. [37] is employed and extended in large displacement. The nonlinear system of equations is iteratively solved by Newton–Raphson׳s method using three imbricated loops at different levels (structural level, element level and cross-section level).The main objective of this numerical example is to analyze the effect of geometrical nonlinearity on the beam deflection in the elastic range as well as in plastic range. To do so, we consider a simply-supported steel–concrete beam. The beam has a span length of 2800mm loaded by a single concentrated force at mid-span. The steel section of the beam is IPE 330. The slab is 800mm wide and 100 mm thick, longitudinally reinforced by 5 steel bars of 14mm diameter at the mid-depth. The geometric characteristics and the material properties of the beam are shown inFig. 3.The von Mises plasticity model with combined isotropic and kinematic hardening is adopted for steel. An extensive description for formulation constitutive rate equations of this model can be found in [38,39]. As to the constitutive law of concrete, for the sake of simplicity it is assumed that the shear and tension/compression behaviors are uncoupled and therefore the 1D constitutive law is used. The elastic linear shear behavior is adopted while the 1D elasto-plastic model developed in [40] is used for concrete in tension/compression. The connection is modeled by an elastic-perfectly plastic model.Table 1 presents the constitutive model parameters which are used for the computer analysis. Note that, in this table, all symbols are defined in the corresponding cited references.The numerical integrations over the layer cross-section are performed using 5 Gauss–Lobato points. The same number of the Gauss–Lobato point is used for the numerical integrations over the element length.In order to assess the performance of the present force-based formulation, the results will be compared with the ones obtained with the classical displacement-based formulation (see [39]).Figs. 4 and 5 show the comparisons between the global load/deflection responses obtained by linear and nonlinear geometric analyses. For the sake of clarity in these figures, the following notations are used for the legends of the curves: E means element; D means the displacement-based model; F means the force-based model; ML means material linearity; MN means material nonlinearity; GL means geometric linearity and GN means geometric nonlinearity. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that, the same number of element force-based and displacement-based models gives almost the same elastic load/deflection curves. This is to confirm the well-known conclusion that in elastic range the force and displacement approaches are equivalent because the force field is linearly related to displacement field. Regarding the geometrical nonlinearity, it starts to affect significantly the beam deflection as the deflection exceeds 400mm (about L/7). For instance, we can observe that the deflection increases by about 100mm (20%) at a load level of 50,000kN. However, it can be seen from Fig. 5 that such beam behaves elastically up to a load equal to 500kN. Therefore, the elastic deflection of the composite steel–concrete beam can be computed by neglecting the effect of geometrical nonlinearity.In the case where all materials have an elasto-plastic behavior, load/deflection curves for different numbers of displacement-based and force-based elements are shown in Fig. 5. It is shown that a mesh of 4 force-based elements gives almost the same curve of the one of 10 force-based. It is to say that only 4 force-based elements are required to obtain the converged nonlinear response of the beam. However, 10 displacement-based elements do not give yet the converged solution. This is to say that when the material nonlinearity is considered, the force-based model produces a better global load/deflection response. The improved accuracy of the force-based solution is related to the fact that the equilibrium is satisfied in strict sense even in the plastic range. Furthermore, once again we can conclude from Fig. 5 that in this example the beam can be considered in large displacement when the deflection exceeds 14% beam length.The buckling behavior of the two-layer column depicted inFig. 6 is investigated. The column is clamped at one end and subjected to a compression force at the other end. For simplicity purposes, the layers are made from the same material and they have the same cross-section dimension as indicated in Fig. 6. An elastic perfectly plastic behavior is assumed for each layer.Due to the geometric and material nonlinearities, the finite element problem is numerically solved in an incremental way. A specific technique is implemented within this numerical procedure, following [41], in order to detect the bifurcation points along the fundamental equilibrium path. At the end of each increment, it must be checked whether one has gone across one or several critical points. The detection of critical points is based on the singularity of the tangent stiffness matrix, which may be factorized following the Crout formulaKg=LdLT, whereLis a lower triangular matrix with unit diagonal elements anddis a diagonal matrix. Since the number of negative eigenvalues ofKgis equal to the number of negative diagonal elements (pivots) ofd, the critical points are determined by counting the negative pivot number and comparing its value between the successive increments.The elastic buckling force of the two-layer column is now investigated. The material parameters used for the calculation are:E=8000MPa andG=3200MPa. For this numerical example, the column length of 1m is considered. In order to access the accuracy of the present FE model, the numerical buckling load, computed with 10 and 100 elements will be compared with the analytical solution developed by Le Grocgnec et al. [30] for three values of connection stiffness:ksc=1MPa (no bond);ksc=1000MPa;ksc=1,000,000MPa (perfect bond). The results are given inTable 2. It can be seen that with 10 elements the relative error in buckling load is about 2.68% in the case of no bond and goes down to 1.95% in the case of perfect bond. These relative differences are significantly improved with a mesh of 100 elements. The proposed model is thus accurate in predicting the buckling load of composite column in partial interaction taking into account the shear flexibility of the layers.The influence of the material nonlinearity on the critical buckling load of the two-layer column depicted in Fig. 6 is now investigated. For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that the shear behavior is linear elastic given byτ=Gγwhile the tension/compression behavior is elastic perfectly plastic as shown in Fig. 6. The constitutive law of connection is taken to be linear.Fig. 7 displays the evolution of the ratio elastoplastic buckling load and plastic load versus the slenderness of the column for different values of connection stiffness. The plastic load is defined asPpl=(Aa+Ab)σywhereσy=70MPa being the yield strength. The slenderness of the column is defined asλ=LA/IwhereA=Aa+Abis the total area andI=Ia+Ibis the total inertia moment of the cross-section with respect to its centroid. It can be observed that for the slenderness smaller than 30 and for any value of connection stiffness the column bucks after reaching the yield strength of the cross-section. As an elastic perfectly plastic model was adopted for the material law, the buckling load is thus equal to the plastic load. Furthermore, it clearly appears that for the slenderness greater than 30 buckling load the buckling load hardly depends on the connection stiffness. For instant, with a slenderness of 60 the buckling load decreases about 68% from no bond to perfect bond.
