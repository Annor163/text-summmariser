@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The management of hesitant fuzzy information is a topic of special interest in fuzzy decision making. In this paper, we focus on the use and properties of the fuzzy linguistic modelling based on discrete fuzzy numbers to manage hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. Among these properties, we can highlight the existence of aggregation functions with no need of transformations or the possibility of a greater flexibilization of the opinions of the experts, even using different linguistic chains (multigranularity). Furthermore, based on these properties we perform a comparison between this model and the one based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets, showing the advantages of the former with respect to the latter. Finally, a fuzzy decision making model based on discrete fuzzy numbers is proposed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The presence of uncertainty is a common feature that characterizes a wide range of real problems related to decision making. Thus, for instance, a group of experts should decide the feasibility of a financial transaction from information which is often vague or incomplete, or similarly, when a medical team must make a diagnosis based on preliminary tests. Frequently, the uncertainty appears when we use assessments not necessarily quantitative but we deal with terms or qualitative information when making the decision. For this reason, the fuzzy linguistic approximations have emerged as a tool which allow to properly handle the qualitative information. In this sense, we highlight the symbolic linguistic model based on ordinal scales (wherein an order is considered among the different linguistic labels) [11,14]; the linguistic 2-tuples model[15], which introduces the symbolic translation to the linguistic representation; the linguistic model based on type-2 fuzzy sets representation[32], which represents the semantics of the linguistic terms using type-2 fuzzy membership functions; the proportional 2-tuple model[34], which extends the 2-tuple model by using two linguistic terms with their proportion to model the information, or the linguistic model based on PSO and granular computing of linguistic information[2], which proposes to model the linguistic information like expressed in terms of information granules defined as sets, among many others. A common feature of many of these models is that experts should express their valuations choosing a single linguistic level associated with the linguistic variable. This kind of information is usually interpreted using a linguistic scale like this,(1)L={EB,VB,B,F,G,VG,EG}where the linguistic terms correspond to the expressions “Extremely Bad”, “Very Bad”, “Bad”, “Fair”, “Good”, “Very Good” and “Extremely Good” respectively. However in many cases the experts’ opinions do not correspond exactly to a particular linguistic term. On the contrary, expressions like “better than good” or “between fair and very good” or, even more complex ones, are commonly used by experts in order to make their opinions. Recently, V. Torra [31] introduced the hesitant fuzzy sets as a possible generalization of the classical fuzzy sets. Based on this idea, different authors [29,30,36,37] have proposed a computational linguistic model based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets, allowing that the expert could consider several possible linguistic values or richer expressions than a single term for an indicator, alternative, variable, etc; increasing the richness of linguistic elicitation based on fuzzy linguistic approach. Several methods based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets for group decision-making have been recently proposed (see [6,17,18,35,40]). On the other hand, the authors [4,5,21,26–28] have considered another linguistic computational model based on discrete fuzzy numbers [33], which allows to interpret the qualitative information in a more flexible way and also enables to aggregate the information they expressed using this type of fuzzy subsets directly. Although at a first glance the two models seems to be different, they are in fact quite connected. As we will prove, the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets used by the first model can be interpreted as particular cases of discrete fuzzy numbers and although the aggregation functions used in the aggregation phase presented in the original articles (see [29] for the hesitant fuzzy sets based one and [21] for the discrete fuzzy numbers based one) are different (as it is the exploitation phase), if both models used the adequate aggregation functions and the same exploitation method, the results would coincide.In this article we want to make a step further and the main goal will be to show the advantages of using the model based on discrete fuzzy numbers with respect to the hesitant fuzzy sets based one. These advantages are related to the existence of aggregation functions on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers which allow us to aggregate the opinions without any transformation or loss of information, to the possibility of a greater flexibilization of the opinions given by the experts and finally, to the possibility of the experts to evaluate using different linguistic chains (multigranularity [23]). We will also present an example of a multi-criteria decision making problem using the linguistic model based on discrete fuzzy numbers, showing the commented advantages of this method.The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we make a brief review of discrete fuzzy numbers and hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. In Section 3, we explain the main characteristics of the fuzzy linguistic model based on discrete fuzzy numbers, comparing this method with the model based on hesitant fuzzy linguist term sets. Throughout the process, we prove that the discrete fuzzy numbers allow a greater flexibilization and an easier management of the opinions given by the experts. In Section 4, we propose a multi-criteria decision making approach based on these particular fuzzy subsets using extensions of two well known discrete parametric compensatory aggregation functions [8,20]. The last section is devoted to give some conclusions and the future work that we want to develop.In this section, we recall some definitions and results about aggregation functions and discrete fuzzy numbers which will be used later. We also recall the notion of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets and some operations related to this concept.Let (P;≤) be a non-trivial bounded partially ordered set (poset) with 0 and 1 as minimum and maximum elements respectively.Definition 1An n-ary aggregation function on P is a function F:Pn→P such that it is increasing in each component, F(0, …, 0)=0 and F(1, …, 1)=1.Remark 1Of course, the number of inputs to be aggregated can be different in each case. Thus, aggregation functions are commonly defined not on Pn, but on∪n≥1Pnand then they are usually called extended aggregation functions. An easy way to construct extended aggregation functions is from associative binary aggregation functions.An important case is when we take as poset a finite chain Lnwith n+1 elements. In such a framework, only the number of elements is relevant (see [24]) and so the simplest finite chain, that is Ln={0, 1, ⋯, n}, is usually considered. On the other hand, it is well known that qualitative information is often interpreted as values in a totally ordered finite scaleLlike this:(2)L={EB,VB,B,F,G,VG,EG}.In these cases, the representative finite chain Lnis used to model these linguistic hedges (L6 for the previous scale (2)) and several researchers have developed an extensive study of aggregation functions on Ln, usually called discrete aggregation functions[9,10,16,19,20,24,39].By a fuzzy subset ofℝ, we mean a functionA:ℝ→[0,1]. For each fuzzy subset A, letAα={x∈ℝ:A(x)≥α}for any α∈(0, 1] be its α-level set (or α-cut). By supp(A), we mean the support of A, i.e. the set{x∈ℝ:A(x)>0}. By A0, we mean the closure of supp(A).Definition 2[33] A fuzzy subset A ofℝwith membership mappingA:ℝ→[0,1]is called a discrete fuzzy number if its support is finite, i.e., there existx1,…,xn∈ℝwith x1<x2<…<xnsuch that supp(A)={x1, …, xn}, and there are natural numbers s, t with 1≤s≤t≤n such that:1.A(xi)=1 for any natural number i with s≤i≤t (core)A(xi)≤A(xj) for each natural number i, j with 1≤i≤j≤s.A(xi)≥A(xj) for each natural number i, j with t≤i≤j≤n.Remark 2If the fuzzy subset A is a discrete fuzzy number then the support of A coincides with its closure, i.e. supp(A)=A0.From now on, we will denote the set of discrete fuzzy numbers using the abbreviation DFN and dfn will denote a discrete fuzzy number. Also, we will denote byA1Lnthe set of all discrete fuzzy numbers whose support is a subinterval of the finite chain Ln. Moreover, note that for anyA∈A1Ln, not only supp(A) is an interval of Ln, but also any α-level set. So, letA,B∈A1Lnbe two discrete fuzzy numbers, and we will denote byAα=[x1α,xpα],Bα=[y1α,ykα]the α-level cuts for A and B, respectively.The authors showed in [3] thatA1Lnis a bounded distributive lattice while the set of discrete fuzzy numbers in general is not.Aggregation functions defined on Lnhave been extended to the bounded latticeA1Ln(see for instance [4,26]) according to the next result.Theorem 1[4,26]Let consider a binary aggregation function F on the finite chain Ln. The binary operation onA1Lndefined as followsF:A1Ln×A1Ln⟶A1Ln(A,B)⟼F(A,B)beingF(A,B)the discrete fuzzy number whose α-cuts are the sets{z∈Ln∣minF(Aα,Bα)≤z≤maxF(Aα,Bα)}for each α∈[0, 1] is an aggregation function onA1Ln. This function will be called the extension of the discrete aggregation function F toA1Ln. In particular, if F is a t-norm, a t-conorm, a uninorm or a nullnorm, its extensionF, so is. In addition, if F is a compensatory aggregation function in Ln, so is its extensionF.Example 1Let us consider the finite chain L8={0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} and A={0.3/0, 0.5/1, 1/2, 0.3/3},B={0.3/2,0.5/3,1/4,0.8/5}∈A1L8.•Consider the discrete idempotent uninorm [9]U(x,y)=min(x,y),ify≤8−x,max(x,y),otherwise,defined on the finite chain L8.ThenU(A,B)={0.3/0,0.5/1,1/2,0.3/3}.Consider the discrete nullnorm defined on L8F(x,y)=min(x+y,4),if(x,y)∈[0,4]2,max(4,x+y−8),if(x,y)∈[4,8]2,4,otherwise.ThenF(A,B)={0.3/2,0.3/3,1/4}.The concept of hesitant fuzzy set was introduced by V. Torra [31] as a possible extension or generalization of the classical fuzzy sets. Formally,Definition 3Let X be a reference set, a hesitant fuzzy set, HFS, on X is a function h that returns for each element x∈X a subset of values in [0, 1].Equivalently, it is possible to construct a HFS from a finite family of membership functions on X, that is,Definition 4Let M=[μ1, μ2, ⋯, μk] be a set of k membership functions on X. Then the HFS that is associated with M, HM, is defined as HM(x)=∪μ∈M{μ(x)}.Some basic operations with the HFS such as union, intersection, complement among many others were defined and studied in detail in [31].In this section we recall the notion of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTS) [30] and some operations with these sets. It is worthy to mention that the HFLTS allows to model comparative linguistic expression using a context-free grammar.Definition 5[30] Let S={s0, ⋯, sn} be a linguistic term set, an HFLTS, HS, is an ordered finite subset of consecutive linguistic terms of S.An HFLTS is a linguistic term subset and the comparison among these elements is not simple. This comparison between these linguistic terms is carried out using the concept of envelope for an HFLTS (see [30] for further details). The linguistic expressions, ll, are produced by a context-free grammar, GHand represented by an HFLTS (see [30]). The linguistic expressions that are generated by using the production rules will be transformed into HFLTS in different ways according to their meanings:(3)EGH(less thansi)={sjsj∈Sandsj≤si},EGH(greater thansi)={sjsj∈Sandsj≥si},EGH(betweensiandsj)={sksk∈Sandsi≤sk≤sj},for all 0≤i, j≤n.In this section we present the fuzzy linguistic model based on discrete fuzzy numbers whose support is an interval of the finite chain Ln={0, 1, ⋯, n}. Moreover, we will compare this linguistic model with the model based on HFLTS and we will prove that the latter can be interpreted as a particular case of the one based on discrete fuzzy numbers. Moreover, in this last model, a greater flexibilization and an easier management of the opinions given by the experts is possible.First of all, note that we can consider a bijective mapping between the ordinal scaleL={s0,⋯,sn}and the finite chain Lnwhich keeps the original order. Furthermore, each normal discrete convex fuzzy subset defined on the ordinal scaleLcan be considered like a discrete fuzzy number belonging toA1Ln, and vice-versa.For example, consider the linguistic hedge(4)L={EB,VB,B,F,G,VG,EG}where the letters refer to the linguistic terms Extremely Bad, Very Bad, Bad, Fair, Good, Very Good and Extremely Good and they are listed in an increasing order:EB≺VB≺B≺F≺G≺VG≺EGand the finite chain L6.Thus, the discrete fuzzy numberA={0.5/2,0.6/3,0.8/4,1/5,0.8/6}∈A1L6can be also expressed as A={0.5/B, 0.6/F, 0.8/G, 1/VG, 0.8/EG}. Note that these fuzzy subsets can be interpreted as a possible flexibilization of the linguistic labels. In this way, the previous fuzzy subset A can be interpreted as a flexibilization of the linguistic label VG (Very Good) (see Fig. 1).Definition 6Let Ln={0, ⋯, n} be a finite chain. We call a subjective evaluation to each discrete fuzzy number belonging to the partially ordered setA1Ln.According to the previous comments, a subjective evaluation can be interpreted equivalently like a normal convex fuzzy subset defined on the ordinal scaleL.To compare with the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets approach, note that any HFLTS representing a linguistic expression as in (3) can be also interpreted in our context as a discrete fuzzy numberA∈A1Lnsuch that, both, core(A) and supp(A) coincide with the corresponding interval.In this way, we will have:(5)Labelsi≡1si=the only discrete fuzzy numberAwithsupp(A)={si},Betweensiandsj≡{A∈A1Ln|core(A)=supp(A)=[si,sj]}Worse thansi≡{A∈A1Ln|core(A)=supp(A)=[s0,si−1]}Better thansi≡{A∈A1Ln|core(A)=supp(A)=[si+1,sn]}See for instance, Fig. 2, where the subjective evaluation “between Bad and Good” is depicted.It is clear that, with this equivalence, any manipulation that we can do with HFLTS can also be done with the corresponding discrete fuzzy numbers described in (5).Moreover, this last approach presents three additional advantages:First advantage. An interesting aspect about the linguistic interpretation based on subjective evaluations is that it does not need making previous transformations when we wish to aggregate the information. Each subjective evaluation considered by an expert is defined, according to Definition 6, as a discrete fuzzy number of the bounded setA1Lnand consequently, we can handle this information directly according to Theorem 1.Second advantage. This approach allows more flexibilization of the linguistic term sets. As we have mentioned above, Fig. 1 represents a flexibilization of the linguistic label Very Good (VG). Similarly, it is possible to define different flexibilizations as the linguistic expressions generated by using production rules of the context-free grammar GHsuch as it is presented in (3).In this sense, we define the following linguistic expressions interpreted as subjective evaluations:(6)Betweensiandsj={A∈A1Ln∣core(A)=[si,sj]}Worse thansi={A∈A1Ln∣core(A)=[s0,si−1]}Better thansi={A∈A1Ln∣core(A)=[si+1,sn]}for all 0≤i, j≤n.Thus, discrete fuzzy numbersA∈A1Lnwith core(A)=[si, sj], but with a different support, can be interpreted as flexibilizations of the subjective evaluation “between siand sj”, and similarly with the other expressions in (5). In addition, the above linguistic expressions are not unique and allow us to describe in a more flexible way the different interpretations that may have the experts when performing a qualitative assessment. Thus, the flexibility that may give an expert assigning values outside the core will depend on the security he has about his evaluation. When the expert does not hesitate about the election of the set of possible linguistic labels, we would be on the case that the subjective evaluation satisfies that its support coincides with its core. In this last case, we would obtain a coincidence between the interpretation presented in [29] and the purpose of this work (see Fig. 2). However, Fig. 3(c) can be seen as an interpretation of the linguistic expression “Better than Good” where the expert does not reject the possibility to assess some positive values outside of the core, allowing a greater flexibility of the linguistic expression and therefore his assessment (see the example below).Example 2Figs. 3(a), (b) i (c) represent the subjective evaluationsA={0.2/B,1/F,1/G,0.8/VG},B={1/EB,1/VB,0.7/B,0.2/F,0.1/G},C={0.2/B,0.3/F,0.9/G,1/VG,1/EG},that interpret the linguistic expressions between Fair and Good, Worse than Bad and Better than Good.Third advantage. Nowadays, multi-granular fuzzy linguistic models have proved to be useful when dealing with experts with different knowledge levels or linguistic term sets (see [22] and the recent review [25]). Our linguistic model [21] permits also that experts can use different representation formats to express their preferences. In this sense, the experts can use linguistic scales with different granularity in order to make their corresponding assessments. A process that enables to express a final decision encompassing all the assessments expressed in these different linguistic scales was presented in [21].In [29,30] a linguistic computational model for multi-criteria decision making based on symbolic computational models that allows the experts to express its assessments through comparative linguistic expressions or simple linguistic terms is presented. Similarly, in this section we present a model based on subjective evaluations.Following the ideas presented in [30], our proposed model has the following phases:1.Transformation phase: Fixed a linguistic scaleL, each expert assesses using subjective evaluations defined on this scale.Aggregation of the assessments represented by subjective evaluations: The assessments represented by subjective evaluations are aggregated using the operators obtained according to Theorem 1.Exploitation phase: A method is chosen to sort the subjective evaluations and to select the best alternative.Remark 3We emphasize that•In our case there is no process of transformation as it occurs in the case of the linguistic model based on comparative linguistic expressions [30].When all the experts consider subjective evaluations satisfying that its support coincide with its core (see Fig. 2) then the two models obtain the same results (under the hypothesis to use the same aggregation functions and the same exploitation phase).In this section we wish to give an illustrative example of multi-criteria decision making following the three phases explained previously.Suppose that a hotel holding wants to invest in an emerging market. According to some previous experiences in this kind of markets, the company usually consider the following three key criteria in order to assess the alternatives:•c1: Tax benefits.c2: Political stability.c3: The short-term return on investment.x1: Argentine Republic.x2: Cuba.x3: Egypt.The group of experts of the company assesses the criteria for each country via subjective evaluations based on the linguistic scaleL={EB,VB,B,F,G,VG,EG}. Table 1contains the assessments that are provided for the decision problem.According to Table 1, the subjective evaluations that represent these linguistic assessments are:•For the alternative x1 and criteria c1, c2 and c3, we have respectively:BetweenVBandF={0.5/0,1/1,1/2,1/3,0.6/4},BetweenGandVG={0.5/2,0.8/3,1/4,1/5,0.7/6},G={0.6/2,0.7/3,1/4,0.8/5}.For the alternative x2 and criteria c1, c2 and c3, we have respectively:BetweenBandF={0.6/0,0.7/1,1/2,1/3,0.8/4},G={0.8/3,1/4,0.7/5,0.6/6},Worse thanB={1/0,1/1,0.8/2,0.7/3}.For the alternative x3 and criteria c1, c2 and c3, we have respectively:Better thanG={0.6/3,0.8/4,1/5,1/6},BetweenVBandB={0.8/0,1/1,1/2,0.7/3},Better thanG={0.7/3,0.9/4,1/5,1/6}.At this point, we will perform the linguistic computational model based on discrete fuzzy numbers in order to obtain which is the best market to invest.The next step is to aggregate the assessments expressed by the previous subjective evaluations. As result of such fusion we obtain another subjective evaluation which represents the collective preference.In order to show the potential of our aggregation method using subjective evaluations we consider two interesting families of compensatory aggregation functions which depend on a parameter. Moreover, we study the behaviour of the method according to the value of the chosen parameter. The first one is the well known family of kernel discrete function [20] and the second one is the family of discrete idempotent uninorms [8].•In the first case, if we get the extension of the kernel aggregation function [20](7)F(x,y,z)=max(min(x,y,z),max(x,y,z)−3)we obtain that the aggregations for each alternative are:–For the alternative x1Ax1={0.5/0,1/1,1/2,1/3,0.6/4}For the alternative x2Ax2={0.8/0,1/1,0.8/2,0.7/3}For the alternative x3Ax3={0.6/0,0.8/1,1/2,1/3}Note that in the kernel aggregation function given by (7), instead of the value of the parameter 3 we could have considered any other value k∈[0, 6] (see [20]). In particular, when k=0, the corresponding aggregation function F is the maximum and when k=6, F is the minimum. Thus, values close to zero would give us more optimistic subjective evaluations. Conversely, values close to 6 would give us less optimistic subjective evaluations.•In the second case, if we get the extension of the idempotent uninorm [8](8)U(x,y)=max(x,y),ifx,y∈[e,6],min(x,y),otherwise.taking as a particular case e=3, we obtain that the aggregations for each alternative are:–For the alternative x1Ax1={0.5/0,1/1,1/2,1/3,1/4,1/5,0.7/6}.For the alternative x2Ax2={1/0,1/1,0.8/2,0.7/3,0.7/4,0.7/5,0.6/6}.For the alternative x3Ax3={0.8/0,1/1,1/2,0.7/3,0.7/4,0.7/5,0.7/6}.Analogously to the case of kernel aggregation functions, instead of taking as neutral element of the uninorm e=3, we could also have taken any value e∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The choice of the neutral element is crucial for the behaviour of the aggregation phase. Values close to 1 would give us more optimistic subjective evaluations, while greater values would rise on less optimistic subjective evaluations. The structure of the idempotent uninorms is the main reason of this behaviour. As lower is the neutral element, greater is the region where the uninorm acts as the maximum and consequently, between a good evaluation and a bad one, the output will be the good one determining an optimistic behaviour.The linguistic computational model based on discrete fuzzy numbers through the use of these parametrized aggregation functions is able to handle adequately divergent evaluations for the different criteria. This fact can be observed in the next example where some extreme evaluations are considered.Example 3To show the effect of the parameter, let us consider just in this particular example, the following three subjective evaluations:BetweenEBandVB={1/0,1/1,0.5/2},BetweenBandG={0.5/1,1/2,1/3,1/4,0.5/5},BetweenVGandEG={0.5/4,1/5,1/6}.As it can be observed, there is one extremely negative, one extremely positive and an average evaluation. Therefore, the three experts absolutely disagree on the evaluation of this alternative. In this case, the value of the parameter of the aggregation functions explained above plays a significant role to determine the output of the aggregation of these three evaluations. In fact, a wide range of outputs can be obtained depending on the parameter value. The choice of the parameter and subsequently of the aggregation function relies on the expert who performs the computational model according to the proper nature of the multicriteria decision making problem. For instance, if we focus on the kernel aggregation function defined in (7), we obtain the following results depending on the value of the parameter k:•k=0: Between VG and EG={0.5/4, 1/5, 1/6}.k=1: Between G and VG={0.5/3, 1/4, 1/5}.k=2: Between F and G={0.5/2, 1/3, 1/4}.k=3: Between B and F={0.5/1, 1/2, 1/3}.k=4: Between VB and B={0.5/0, 1/1, 1/2}.k=5: Between EB and VB={1/0, 1/1, 0.5/2}.k=6: Between EB and VB={1/0, 1/1, 0.5/2}.Remark 4In the literature, one of the most important linguistic aggregation operators are the OWA operators and their generalizations [38]. In our framework, it is also possible to define OWA type aggregation functions from OWA functions defined on Ln. However, in this discrete chain, these functions need a rounding function in order to get as output a value of the chain (see [16]). This fact could produce a loss of accuracy throughout the process and thus, the previous discrete aggregation functions are preferable since all the computations always remain into the domain of the finite chain.Previously we dealt with the aggregation phase in order to obtain a collective preference value for each possible alternative based on the subjective evaluations given by the experts. Now, we need to choose the best one, i.e., to exploit the collective linguistic preference (see [1,12]). There exist a great number of ranking methods, especially for classical fuzzy numbers, such as the centroid method, center of maxima, median, etc. Focusing on the ones which can be adapted to discrete fuzzy numbers, we can highlight the one proposed by L. Chen and H. Lu in [7] which adapts perfectly to our framework and it was already considered in [21]. Let us summarize this procedure briefly.L. Chen and H. Lu's method is based at a first step on the computation of the so-called left and right dominance, denoted byDi,jLandDi,jR, of Aiover Ajwhich are given by:Di,jL=1n+1∑k=0n(li,k−lj,k),Di,jR=1n+1∑k=0n(ri,k−rj,k),where n+1 α-cuts are used to calculate the dominance and li,kand ri,kare computed as follows:li,k=minx∈ℝ{x∣A(x)≥αk},ri,k=maxx∈ℝ{x∣A(x)≥αk}.Remark 5It is straightforward to prove that the dominance values are dependent of the α-cuts used to calculate it. Thus, a criterion must be defined to select which α-cuts must be considered. In fact, this is one of the major differences between the use of this ranking method with fuzzy numbers or with discrete fuzzy numbers. When considering fuzzy numbers the choice of the number n of α-cuts is quite arbitrary. Depending on how well we want to approximate the area difference between the two fuzzy numbers, we will choose a concrete value n. However, for discrete fuzzy numbers, we will consider the relevant α-cuts of each one, i.e., the set of different α-cuts of each number. To illustrate the concept of relevant α-cuts, let us consider the following two dfns A and B given byA={0.4/0,0.5/1,1/2,0.6/3},B={0.3/1,0.6/2,0.6/3,1/4}.The relevant α-cuts of each dfn are•A0.4=[0, 3], A0.5=[1, 3], A0.6=[2, 3] and A1=[2, 2].B0.3=[1, 4], B0.6=[2, 4] and B1=[4, 4].A0.3=A0.4=[0, 3], A0.5=[1, 3], A0.6=[2, 3] and A1=[2, 2].B0.3=[1, 4], B0.4=B0.5=B0.6=[2, 4] and B1=[4, 4].A decision maker can rank a pair of fuzzy numbers, Aiand Aj, using Di,j(β) according to the following rules:1.If Di,j(β)>0 then Ai>Aj;If Di,j(β)=0 then Ai=Aj;If Di,j(β)<0 then Ai<Aj.This dominance between discrete fuzzy numbers satisfies some desirable properties, collected in the next result.Proposition 2[7]Let Ai, Ajand Akbe any three arbitrary fuzzy numbers, where i≠j≠k. Then:1.The total dominance of a dfn over itself is 0, i.e., Di,i(β)=0 for any i and β.The total dominance of Aiover Ajis opposite to that of Ajover Ai, i.e., Di,j(β)=−Dj,i(β) for any i, j and β.The transitivity property holds: if Di,j(β)>0 and Dj,k(β)>0, then Di,k(β)>0.Finally, in this phase we will arrange the above subjective evaluations to decide which is the best alternative of the three previously obtained. We will show the computations when we consider the extension of a kernel aggregation function (7) with k=3 in order to obtain the fusion of the assessments. First, let us determine the relevant α-cuts of theAx1,Ax2andAx3, computed in Section 4.2.•Ax10.5=[0,4],Ax10.6=[1,4]andAx11=[1,3].Ax20.7=[0,3],Ax20.8=[0,2]andAx21=[1,1].Ax30.6=[0,3],Ax30.8=[1,3]andAx31=[2,3].Ax10.5=[0,4],Ax10.6=[1,4]andAx10.7=Ax10.8=Ax11=[1,3].Ax20.5=Ax20.6=Ax20.7=[0,3],Ax20.8=[0,2]andAx21=[1,1].Ax30.5=Ax30.6=[0,3],Ax30.7=Ax30.8=[1,3]andAx31=[2,3].If β=0,Ax1=Ax3>Ax2.If β>0,Ax1>Ax3>Ax2.In Figs. 4and 5, we display the rankings of the alternatives depending on the aggregation function (kernel and idempotent uninorm, respectively) and the value of β. At a first glance, we can observe that the alternatives are ranked in a different way depending on the parameter of the function and the value of β. For instance, focusing on the kernel discrete aggregation function, while for k≥3, x1 is assessed as the best alternative, in the remaining cases x3 is the best option. This is coherent with the evaluations given by the experts and the behaviour of the parameter. In Table 1 which is included at the beginning of Section 4.1, we can see that x3 has two quite notable evaluations but the other one is extremely negative. Setting the parameter of the discrete kernel aggregation function to its more optimistic set-up, we have promoted the positive evaluations instead of the negative one and consequently, the output value of the aggregation is positive.The β value also takes into account these evaluations. For instance, in the uninorm case with e=1, if we considerβ>911, we get that x3>x1>x2 and then the best alternative is x3. For lower values of β, which are more pessimistic values, the best alternative is again x1 due to the bad evaluation of x3 for c2. So, to sum up, the parameter values of the aggregation functions allow to design a computational linguistic model based on discrete fuzzy numbers meeting the needs and desires of the person who is performing this multicriteria decision making problem.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have analysed and compared both linguistic computational models, one based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets and another based on discrete fuzzy numbers. Since the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets can be interpreted as particular cases of discrete fuzzy numbers whose support coincides with their core, with the appropriate aggregation functions and exploitation method, both methods agree in their final decision. However, we should point out that the model based on discrete fuzzy numbers presents some advantages with respect to the other model. Particularly, in the linguistic computational model based on discrete fuzzy numbers, the experts can evaluate the alternatives using different linguistic scales with a greater flexibility. In addition, there is no need of any transformation since the aggregation functions on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers are well-defined and studied.In the future, we want to compare this model with other important linguistic computational models proposed in the literature, like the unbalanced linguistic computational model [13] and the linguistic computational model based on granular computing [2].
