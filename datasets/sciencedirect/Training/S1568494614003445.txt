@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a new and efficient optimization technique based on hybridization of chemical reaction optimization (CRO) with differential evolution (DE) is developed and demonstrated to solve the ELD problem with thermal cost function having valve point loading effect together with and without multiple fuel options and with and without considering prohibited operating zone and ramp rate constraint. When valve-point effects, multi-fuel operations and the constraints of prohibited operating zone and ramp rate are taken into account, ELD problem become more complex than conventional ELD problem. To show the priority of the proposed algorithm, it is implemented on six different test systems for solving ELD problems. Comparative studies are carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed HCRO-DE approach with conventional DE, CRO and the other algorithms reported in the literature. The simulation results show that the proposed HCRO-DE method is capable of obtaining better quality solutions than DE, CRO and the other well popular optimization techniques.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Economic load dispatch (ELD) has become an essential part in operation and control of modern power system. Its main objective is to seek the best generation schedule for the generating plants whereby the required demand together with the transmission losses can be produced with the minimum production cost. The ELD problem is formulated in various ways in the literature. Some researchers used non-smooth operational cost function as the objective function for ELD with simple power balance and power range constraints. The non-smooth cost function is used to reflect the actual realistic operational condition, such as the multi-fuel effect caused by the changes of fuel types and the valve-point loading effect due to operation of the multi-valve steam turbine. Few researchers considered a smooth cost function for cost minimization objective of ELD but with more complex constraints, such as ramp rate limits, prohibited operating zones, and transmission losses in the power balance constraint. However, most of the researchers used non-smooth cost function with complex constraints, such as ramp rate limits, prohibited operating zones, spinning reserve, transmission losses in the power balance in ELD problem formulation. A practical optimal ELD problem should consider generation limit, ramp rate, prohibited operating zone, transmission loss at every time interval such that the total cost is minimum. A bibliographical survey of existing literature on ELD methods reveals that various numerical optimization techniques are employed to solve the ELD problem. Some of these methods are conventional classical optimization technique and others are modern heuristic optimization technique. Previously, many classical methods like gradient method [1], lambda iteration method (LIM) [2], linear programming (LP) [3], quadratic programming (QP) [4], dynamic programming (DP) [5], non-linear programming method (NLP) [6], Lagrangian method [7], etc. gained a lot of popularity in the last few decades to solve the objective function for ELD problem along with its constraints. The ELD problem with valve-point effects, multiple fuel options, prohibited operating zone and ramp rate is represented as a non-smooth optimization problem having complex and non-convex characteristics with heavy equality and inequality constraints, which makes the challenge of finding the global optimum hard. Conventional optimization methods that make use of derivatives and gradients, in general, are not able to locate or identify the global optimum. Most of these techniques are not capable of solving efficiently optimization problems with a non-convex, non-continuous and highly non-linear solution space. In these numerical methods for solution of ELD problems, an essential assumption is that the incremental cost curves of the units are monotonically increasing piecewise-linear functions. For the nonlinear characteristics of the practical systems, this assumption makes these methods infeasible. LIM method [2] has a problem in handling large number of inequality constraint. The major disadvantage of LP method [3] is piecewise linear cost approximation though this method is fast and reliable whereas NLP method [6] has a disadvantage of algorithmic complexity.On the other hand, evolutionary computation approaches obtained remarkable importance in this domain since they can provide solutions leading to a considerable reduction of generator fuel consumption and provide these solutions at low computational time. Besides this, recent advances in computation and the search for global optimum solutions of complex optimization problem have fomented the development of a group of techniques known as modern heuristic algorithms. The methods that qualify are evolutionary programming (EP) [8,9], artificial intelligence (AI) [10], neural networks (NN) [11], genetic algorithm (GA) [12], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [13,14], simulated annealing (SA) [15], differential evolution (DE) [16,17], bee colony optimization (BCO) [18], bio-geography based optimization (BBO) [19], modified sub-gradient algorithm [20], etc. The PSO technique developed by Kennedy and Eberhart [13] has made an impact for solving ELD problem and is based on the social behaviour of bird flocking and fish schooling. The PSO algorithm is quite impressive for solving ELD problem because of its first convergence feature. Baskar and Mohan [21] modified and improved original PSO to solve ELD problem for utility system. Cai et al. [22] proposed a fuzzy adaptive chaotic ant swarm optimization (CASO) for ELD in which a fuzzy system was dynamically tuned the characteristic parameters of CASO. Tsai et al. [23] developed a novel stochastic search (NSS) method for the solution of ELD problems with non-convex fuel cost functions. Vaisakh et al. [24] presented a hybrid heuristic optimization methodology, namely, bacterial foraging based PSO-DE (BPSO-DE) algorithm by integrating bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), PSO and DE for solving non-smooth non-convex dynamic ELD (DELD) problem. Sa-ngiamvibool et al. [25] invented multiple tabu search (MTS) algorithm to solve the ELD problem. Seeker optimization algorithm (SOA) [26] was presented by Shaw et al. for solution of ELD problems. PSO with bacterial foraging effect was come into lime light by Saber [27]. Chaotic quantum GA [28] was first used by Liao for solving environmental economic dispatch problem of smart micro grid. The studies of above evolutionary algorithms, over the past few years, have shown that these methods can be efficiently applied to solve nonlinear optimization problems. However, each of these methods has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses; but long computational time is a common drawback for most of them, especially when the solution space is hard to explore. Many efforts have been made to accelerate convergence of these methods.In this article, hybridization of DE with chemical reaction optimization (CRO), is proposed to improve the convergence property of individual DE and CRO algorithms. Using mutation, crossover and selection operators, DE effectively improves candidate solutions of a population over several generations. DE has an ability to search for the optimal solution in a faster manner using its unique crossover strategies. CRO is a chemical reaction-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm recently proposed by Lam and Li [29]. It has already proven itself a worthy optimization technique compared to other existing techniques. By choosing different combination of elementary reactions, CRO acquires both global and local search ability and does not need a local search method to refine the search. Furthermore, this method does not require tuning of large number of input parameters. Only number of initial reactants is enough for the algorithm implementation. The initial reactants are distributed over feasible search region. CRO manipulates multiple tanks of molecules in parallel. CRO performs different chemical reaction simultaneously. Therefore, CRO is best suited to those types of problems which will benefit from parallel processing rather than sequential processing. Moreover, advantage of CRO over other meta-heuristic methods is its flexible structure which can be easily adjusted to fit the problem.These versatile properties of CRO algorithm encourage the present authors to apply this newly developed algorithm for solving ELD problems. Moreover, to speed up the convergence property and to find better results a hybrid technique combining CRO and DE is introduced in this article In order to utilize the exploration ability of CRO and the exploitation capability of DE, the hybridization of CRO with DE (HCRO-DE), is being proposed to solve ELD problem. Here, a mutation operator of DE is combined with on-wall ineffective collision, decomposition operation and inter-molecular ineffective collision of CRO to explore and exploit the search space effectively.The aim of this paper is to introduce a much simplified, flexible and efficient hybrid optimization algorithm based on chemical reaction optimization (CRO) and differential evolution (DE) which may outperform the ELD based optimization methods reported recent past in literature. In the proposed HCRO-DE approach, CRO algorithm that emphasizes on exploring the entire search space and a local version of DE algorithm that emphasizes on exploitation is combined to achieve better performance. In order to show the validity of the proposed approach, the developed algorithm is illustrated on six test systems. Results obtained from the proposed method are compared with multiple tabu search (MTS) [30], PSO [14,31,32], adaptive PSO (APSO) [32], iteration PSO (IPSO) [33], quantum-inspired PSO (QPSO) [34], new PSO (NPSO) [14], PSO with local random search (PSO-LRS) [14], new PSO with local random search (NPSO-LRS) [14], new adaptive PSO (NAPSO) [35], self-organizing hierarchical PSO (SOH-PSO) [36], hybrid multi-agent based PSO (HMAPSO) [31], PSO with time varying acceleration coefficients (PSO-TVAC) [37], iteration PSO with time varying acceleration coefficients (IPSO-TVAC) [38], ICA-PSO [39], constriction factor and inertia weight based PSO with real-valued mutation (CBPSO_RVM) [40], GA [14], hybrid GA (HGA) [41], conventional GA with multiplier updating (CGA_MU) [42], improved GA with multiplier updating (IGA_MU) [42], DE [43], modified DE (MDE) [44], variable DE with the fuzzy adaptive PSO (FAPSO-VDE) [45], self-tuning hybrid DE (SHDE) [46], BFO [47], hybrid harmony search (HHS) [48], Maclaurin series-based Lagrangian (MSL) [49], pattern search method (PSM) [50], BBO [51] and DE/BBO [52].The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section ‘Mathematical problem formulation’, the ELD problem formulation is introduced. The CRO and DE algorithms are briefly explained in sections ‘Chemical reaction based optimization’ and ‘Differential evolution’, respectively. Section ‘HCRO-DE algorithm’ illustrates the different steps of the proposed HCRO-DE technique. To prove the efficiency of the solution technique, the simulation results along with cost convergence of the six different test cases are presented in section ‘Computational experiment and results’. Finally, Section ‘Conclusion’ concludes the findings and contributions of this paper.The ELD is one of the most important optimization considerations for management of the power system operation. The ELD problem can be formulated as to find the optimal thermal unit generations to minimize the total cost of fuel while satisfying different operational constraints of thermal unit and load balance constraints.The ELD problem may be described as a minimization problem with the objective as below:(1)MinFC(Pg)=min∑i=1nFCi(Pgi)If the generator costs are represented by quadratic functions, it may be described as follows:(2)FC(Pg)=∑i=1n(aiPgi2+biPgi+ci)However, for practical generator, the sequential valve-opening process for multi-valve steam turbines produces ripple like effect in the heat rate curve of the generator. To analysis ELD problem with this effect, the basic quadratic fuel-cost characteristics should be superimposed with a rectified sinusoidal component. Then the fuel cost function of each generating unit is expressed in the sum of quadratic and sinusoidal form with the valve point effect taken in to account. Thus the total generation cost is expressed as follows:(3)FC(Pg)=∑i=1naiPgi2+biPgi+ci+|di×sin(ei×(Pgimin−Pgi))|where FC(Pg) is the generators total fuel cost; ai, bi, ci, diand eiare the cost coefficients of the i-th generator; Pgiis the generation of the i-th generator andPgiminis the minimum limit of the i-th generator.Furthermore, there may be few generating units supplied with multiple fuels. In that case, the conventional cost function of these units should be modified to the cost function of each unit which could be presented by a few piecewise functions. Each segment of the hybrid cost function implies some information about the type of fuel being burned or the operational characteristics of the unit. Fuel cost function of the i-th generating unit with multiple fuels and valve point effect is given by:(4)FCi(Pgi)=ai1Pgi2+bi1Pgi+ci1+|di1×sin(ei1×(Pgimin−Pgi))|fuel1,Pgimin≤Pgi≤Pgi,1ai2Pgi2+bi2Pgi+ci2+|di2×sin(ei2×(Pgimin−Pgi))|fuel2,Pgi,1≤Pgi≤Pgi,2aikPgi2+bikPgi+cik+|dik×sin(eik×(Pgimin−Pgi))|fuelk,Pgi,k−1min≤Pgi≤Pgi,kThe total power produced by all the generating units must cover the total load demand and the real power loss at the transmission line network, i.e.,(5)∑i=1nPgi=PD+PLwhere PDis the total load demand and PLis the power loss in the transmission line network which may be represented as follows:(6)PL=∑i=1n∑j=1nPgiBijPgj+∑i=1nBi0Pgi+B00where B00, Bijand Bi0 are the transmission loss co-efficient.For stable generation, the total power output of each generator must be in between its maximum and minimum generation limit, i.e.,(7)Pgimin≤Pgi≤PgimaxwherePgimin,Pgiminare the minimum and maximum generation limit, of the i-th generator.Practically, the operating range of all generating units is restricted by their ramp rate limits by forcing the units to operate continually between two adjacent specific operation zones. The power output of each unit is limited by ramp up/down rate as given below(8)Max(Pgimin,Pgi0−DRi)≤Pgi≤Min(Pgimax,Pgi0+URi)wherePgi0is the previous operating point of the i-th unit, DRi, URiare the down rate and up rate limits, respectively, of the i-th unit.In addition, in a generating station, due to the presence of physical operation limitation such as faults in the machines themselves or the associated auxiliaries, such as boiler, feed pumps, etc., generating units can have prohibited operating regions. Usually, generators that operate in these zones may experience amplification of vibrations in their shaft bearing, which should be shorted out. A unit with prohibited operating zones (POZ) has discontinuous input–output characteristic [12]. For unit i with POZs, the feasible operating zones can be described as follows(9)Pgimin≤Pgi≤Pgi,1lPgi,j−1u≤Pgi≤Pgi,jl,Pgi,npiu≤Pgi≤Pgimaxj=2,3,…,npiwhere npiis the number of prohibited zones of i-th unit,Pgi,jl,Pgi,j−1uare the lower and upper generation limits of prohibited zone j and j−1, respectively, of the i-th unit.Very recently, by simulating the behaviour of chemical molecular reaction, an efficient chemical-reaction optimization (CRO) algorithm is proposed by Lam and Li [29] to optimize combinatorial problems. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change. This chemical change occurs due to the formation and breaking of chemical bonds that produced by the motion of electrons of the molecules. Four different types of reactions take place among molecules in a chemical reaction process. These elementary reactions are on-wall ineffective collision, decomposition, inter-molecular ineffective collision and synthesis. Amongst these, the on-wall ineffective collision and decomposition reactions are single molecular reactions, while the inter-molecular ineffective collision and synthesis reaction are of the later category.(i)On-wall ineffective collision: In this collision, each molecule hits the wall and bounces back. However, few changes are occurred in the molecular structure of the original molecule (Ms) and it may transform into a new molecule mole (Ms′) if(10)keMs+peMs≥peMs′where, keMs, peMsare the kinetic energy and potential energy, respectively, of the original molecule; peMs′is the potential energy of the newly generated molecule.Decomposition: A single molecule breaks into two or more elements in this reaction. Because of the severe collision, the resultant molecular structure of newly formed molecule is entirely different from the original one and is also different from the neighbourhood molecules. In decomposition process, the original molecule Mswill break into two molecules Ms′ and Ms″ if(11)keMs+peMs≥peMs′+peMs″Inter-molecular ineffective collision: In this type of collision, two molecules collide with each other and bounce away. As the collision is not severe, the molecular structures of the generated molecules are closer to the original molecules. The original moleculesMs1andMs2will generate two new moleculesMs′1Ms′2by this type of collision if(12)keMs1+peMs1+keMs2+peMs2≥peMs′1+peMs′2Synthesis collision: This type of collision is opposite to decompose collision. In this process, two or more molecules are combined together to form a single molecule and molecular structure of the newly formed molecule is entirely different from the molecular structure of original molecules. Formation of a new moleculeMs′1from the original moleculesMs1andMs2may only be possible if(13)keMs1+peMs1+keMs2+peMs2≥peMs′1Differential evolution (DE) is one of the most popular evolutionary algorithms proposed by Stron and Price in 1995 [16]. It is based on mutation, crossover and selection operators which may be defined as follows:(i)Initialization: The independent variables of a specific problem are randomly initialized between their operating limits as given below:(14)xi,j=xjL+rand×(xjU−xjL)wherexjU,xjLare the upper and lower bound, respectively, of the j-th variable, xi,jis the j-th independent variable of the i-th target vector; rand is a random number between 0 and 1.Mutation: Mutation operation is executed to generate donor vectors. For each target vector xi,j, donor vectorvi,jis defined by [16](15)vi,j=xk,j+F×(xm,j−xn,j)xk,j, xm,j, xn,jare three randomly chosen target vectors of the current population and F is a positive control parameter used for scaling the difference vector.Crossover: Crossover operator is carried out to generate trial vector. Each j-th independent variable of the i-th trial vector is defined by [16](16)ui,j=vi,jifrandi,j≤CRxi,jotherwisewhere CR is the crossover probability and randi,jis a random number between [0, 1].Selection: This operator is used to select the best vector between target and trial vector which is assigned as the target vector for next generation. The selection operation can be expressed as follows [16]:(17)Xi(t+1)=Xi(t+1)=Ui(t)iff(Ui(t))≤f(Xi(t))Xi(t)otherwisewhere Ui=(ui,1, ui,2, …, ui,j, …, ui,d); Xi=(xi,1, xi,2, …, xi,j, …, xi,d), f(x) is the objective function to be minimized and d is the number of control variables.The proposed HCRO-DE method combines the CRO algorithm with the DE technique to improve the performance in terms of the solution quality and convergence speed of the algorithm. The search procedures of HCRO-DE algorithm are described as follows:Step 1: The molecular structure of each molecule is generated randomly and it represents a feasible solution of the problem. The molecular structure of each molecule is represented by a d-dimensional vector, where d is the number of control variables.Step 2: The objective values obtained for the molecules of the population are assigned as the potential energy (PE) of the individual molecule. An initial kinetic energy (KE) is set to all the molecules.Step 3: Few best molecules are kept as elite molecule to retain the best solutions.Step 4: Non-elite molecules are modified by performing on-wall ineffective collision operations as described below:Step 4.1: A molecule Msis selected randomly.Step 4.2: A new molecule Ms′ is generated using mutation operation of DE as described in section ‘Differential evolution’. The j-th componentMS′i,jof molecule Ms′ is defined by(18)Ms′i,j=Msk,j+F×(Msm,j−Msn,j)Msk,j,Msm,j,Msn,jare the components of three different molecules chosen randomly from the current population.Step 4.3: Evaluate the potential energy (fitness value) peMs′of the Ms′ molecule. IfkeMs+peMs≥peMs′, replace MsbyMs′and update the KE of the Ms′ as below:(19)keMs′=r1(keMs+peMs−peMs′)where r1 is a random number uniformly distributed between0,1.Step 5: The molecules are modified using decomposition operation as described below:Step 5.1: One molecule Msis selected from population and another moleculeMsris generated randomly.Step 5.2: Crossover operation of DE is applied on Ms&Msrto generate two new molecules Ms′ and Ms″.Step 5.3: Potential energy (peMs′and peMs″) of molecules Ms′ and Ms″ are evaluated. If keMs+peMs≥peMs′+peMs″, molecule Msis deleted and the molecules Ms′ and Ms″ are pushed into the population. Modify the KE of Ms′ and Ms″ as below:(20)keMs′=r2[keMs+peMs−(peMs′+peMs″)](21)keMs″=(1−r2)[keMs+peMs−(peMs′+peMs″)]where r2 is a random number uniformly distributed between0,1.Step 6: Modify each molecule using inter-molecular ineffective collision as under:Step 6.1: Two moleculesMs1andMs2from the population are selected randomly.Step 6.2: Generate two new moleculesMs′1andMs′2by performing crossover operation of DE as described in section ‘Differential evolution’.Step 6.3: EvaluatepeMs′1andpeMs′2of moleculesMs′1andMs′2IfpeMs1+keMs1+peMs2+keMs2≥peMs′1+peMs′2replace moleculesMs1andMs2by moleculesMs′1andMs′2, respectively. Modify the KE of the moleculesMs1andMs2as below:(22)keMs′1=r3[peMs1+keMs1+peMs2+keMs2−(peMs′1+peMs′2)](23)keMs′2=(1−r3)[peMs1+keMs1+peMs2+keMs2−(peMs′1+peMs′2)]where r3 is a random number uniformly distributed between0,1.Step 7: Modify the molecules using synthesis collision operation which is describe below:Step 7.1: Select two moleculesMs1andMs2randomly from the population set.Step 7.2: Apply the conventional cross over operation of GA onMs1andMs2by considering them as parents chromosomes and generate a child chromosomeMs′1.Step 7.3: EvaluatepeMs′1of the moleculeMs′1.IfkeMs1+peMs1+keMs2+peMs2≥peMs′1delete moleculesMs1andMs2and push the moleculeMs′1into the population. The new moleculeMs′1gets the KE of(24)keMs′1=r4(keMs1+peMs1+keMs2+peMs2−peMs′1)Step 8: The feasibility of a problem solution is verified; i.e., each components of the molecule should satisfy operational constraints of the specific problem.Step 9: Sorting the molecules from best to worst.Step 10: Replace the worst solution by the best elite solutions.Step 11: If the maximum number of generations is reached, output the optimal solution and terminates the proposed algorithm. Otherwise, go back to Step 3.In this section, the performance of the proposed algorithm is judged using four test systems of conventional static ELD with 6, 10, 13 and 40 thermal generators, one test system of restructured ELD problem and one dynamic ELD problem. The non-linear minimization problem formulation of all test cases is solved by using DE, CRO and the proposed HCRO-DE optimization algorithms which are implemented in Matlab-7.6 using Microsoft Windows 7. All the programs are run on a 3.2GHz core i3 processor with 2GB of random access memory. In each case study, 50 independent runs are made for each of the optimization methods involving 50 different initial trial solutions for each case.In this test system, a standard six generating units are considered and the system data, loss formula coefficients and fuel cost coefficients are taken from [30]. Load demand for this system is 1263MW. This test system works with the practical ELD problems that consider prohibited operating zones, ramp-rate limits as well as transmission losses. The best generation schedule of 6 generating units along with fuel cost and transmission loss (TL) of 50 independent trials obtained by the DE, CRO and the proposed HCRO-DE are shown in Table 1. The results clearly indicate that all system constraints, such as the ramp rate limits and prohibited operating zones limits are satisfied. Obtained solution of HCRO-DE is compared with the NPSO-LRS [14], GA [14], PSO [14], MTS [30], IPSO [33], NAPSO [35], SOH-PSO [36], IPSO-TVAC [38], BFO [47], HHS [48], DE and CRO. It can be observed from the Table 1 that the total generation cost using HCRO-DE is US$15,443.075/h, which is less than the cost obtained using CRO (US$15,443.080/h) and DE (US$15,443.105/h). From the comparison, it is also noticed that the proposed algorithm gives more reduction in fuel cost as compared to the all other algorithm except IPSO-TVAC and the solution obtained by HCRO-DE is very much closer to that of IPSO-TVAC. The worst, average, best generation costs, median, standard deviation, and success rate achieved by CRO, DE and HCRO-DE for 50 independent runs are shown in Table 2. The worst, average and best solutions of the HCRO-DE are very close to each other representing the robustness of the proposed method. Moreover, hybrid CRO-DE produces the best standard deviation, median and success rate among its competitors. This clearly suggests that the HCRO-DE is more consistent than the other optimization techniques discussed.This test system includes 10 generating units supplying a total load demand of 2700MW. The system data and related constraints of this test system are taken from [40]. Previously few attempts have been made for solving the realistic ELD problem at considering both valve-point effects and multiple fuels, which sometime simultaneously exist in real power systems. Results obtained by minimizing the fuel cost functions, taking multiple fuels into consideration are tabulated in Table 3. This obtained result by the proposed HCRO-DE is compared with the DE, CRO, PSO_LRS [14], NPSO [14], NPSO_LRS [14], PSO [32], APSO [32], CBPSO_RVM [40], CGA_MU [42] and IGA_MU [42]. Table 3 provides the comparison, showing that the fuel types and dispatch levels of the proposed algorithm is quite different from those of previous approaches. From the results, it is clear that the proposed hybrid CRO-DE generates cost output of US$605.6318/h, which is better than those obtained by CRO (US$610.6187/h) and DE (US$613.6335/h) alone. The proposed method also yields better solution quality than other methods reported in the literature and is more efficient and effective than the previous reported method for solving ELD with multiple fuels in operation. The statistical results of best cost, worst cost and mean cost along with median, standard deviation and success rate are summarized in Table 4, which show that the different statistical parameters obtained by the proposed HCRO-DE method is comparatively better compared to all other methods. To validate the computational speed of the proposed HCRO-DE, the simulation time comparisons with the results available in the literature are performed and tabulated in Table 4. From the results, it is noticed that the proposed HCRO-DE strategy is faster than DE, CRO and other prior approaches.In this test system, two different load demands are considered to evaluate the performance of the DE, CRO and HCRO-DE methods. These are assumed to be 1800 and 2520MW. The details of the quadratic and valve point cost coefficients and generation limits for every unit are taken from [53]. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared to those reported in the literature. Only valve point effect without transmission loss is considered in the other ELD solution methods of Tables 5 and 6. So, for the sake of a fair comparison, neither prohibited operating zone nor ramp rate constraint is considered for the proposed HCRO-DE method as well. From the comparison, it is noticed that the proposed HCRO-DE algorithm gives more reduction in cost compared with PSO [31], HMAPSO [31], QPSO [34], PSO-TVAC [37], ICA_PSO [39], HGA [41], DE [43], MDE [44], FAPSO-VDE [45], SHDE [46], MSL [49], PSM [50] and the similar results as of IPSO-TVAC [38]. Moreover, the fuel costs for this test system with load demand of 1800 and 2520MW yielded by the hybrid CRO-DE (US$17,960.3820/h and US$24,164.8260/h) method is less than those obtained by individual CRO (US$17,961.0703/h and US$24,165.1664/h) and DE (US$17,961.6108/h and US$24,165.6767/h) algorithms. Thus, the results clearly show that the effectiveness of this proposed HCRO-DE method dominates almost all other methods. The statistical results of the CRO, DE and HCRO-DE for the load of 1800 and 2520MW shown in Tables 7 and 8, respectively, are compared with those of other ELD solution methods. The results clearly indicate that the best, average and worst results of the proposed HCRO-DE are better than those of all other ELD solution methods including CRO, DE and are similar to IPSO-TVAC. Moreover, the standard deviation, median and success rate in performance measures is better in HCRO-DE than individual DE and CRO algorithms for both 1800 and 2520MW loads. It directly indicates the improved consistency of hybrid CRO-DE over DE and CRO. The improved performance of HCRO-DE is observed because of the introduction of crossover operation of DE in three different chemical reaction processes of CRO. Tables 7 and 8 also depict the times of attaining a cost within the specified ranges out of 50 runs for each algorithm with randomly generated initial trial solutions. This is in virtue of the fact that hybrid CRO-DE strengthens the convergence speed by DE and maintains the diversity by CRO.To investigate the effectiveness of the HCRO-DE algorithm for large scale power system, it is applied on a 40-unit test system having valve point effect. The transmission losses are not considered in this case. The total load demand for this system is 10,500MW. The full system data along with cost coefficients are taken from [8]. The results obtained from the proposed HCRO-DE algorithm are compared with DE, CRO and the reported results by other methods, namely HMAPSO [31], QPSO [34], IPSO-TVAC [38], HGA [41], FAPSO-VDE [45], BBO [51], DE/BBO [52]. The best cost and the optimal generation scheduling of the 40 generating units obtained by the different approaches are given in Table 9. It is observed from the results that the minimum cost achieved by the proposed hybrid CRO-DE method is US$121,412.550/h which is significantly better than that obtained by CRO (US$121,416.693/h), DE (US$121,417.735/h) and the previously reported cost of US$121,448.21/h [34], US$121,586.9/h [31], US$121,418.27/h [41], US$121,426.953/h [51], US$121,420.9/h [52] while it is comparable to US$121,412.545/h [38] and US$121,412.56/h [45]. Table 10presents the statistical results of 50 different trials for individual DE, CRO and hybrid CRO-DE methods. It is clear from Table 10 that the proposed HCRO-DE gives better statistical results compared to DE, CRO, QPSO [34], HMAPSO [31], HGA [41], BBO [51], DE/BBO [52] and similar results like IPSO-TVAC [38], FAPSO-VDE [45]. Compared with the implementation of CRO and DE algorithms individually, it is apparent that hybrid CRO-DE is able to improve the search process further. Due to the cross over operation of DE integrated with chemical reaction process of CRO in the hybrid CRO-DE algorithm, the probability of being trapped by local optima is reduced. Thus, the result of HCRO-DE for large scale ELD optimization turns out to be very encouraging and promising. The computational time of CRO, DE and HCRO-DE methods is also given in Table 10. These results signify that the HCRO-DE always provides better quality solution in less computational time than CRO and DE methods.To check the superiority of the hybrid CRO-DE algorithm over individual CRO, DE and other algorithms available in the literature for deregulated power system, it is implemented on a 40-unit restructured power system to solve ELD problem. In a deregulated power system, not only the production cost function has involved but also the market strategy has played an important role to form the seller's bidden cost function which makes the classical economic dispatch algorithm inapplicable. Because the property of the bidden cost function is “the higher the output, the lower the incremental cost” [54] and the property of the production cost function “the higher the output, the higher the incremental cost”. The test system 5 includes 40 generating units with maximum non-linearities supplying three different load demand. The details of system data and quadratic cost coefficients of [56] are taken in this simulation study. The system data are also tabulated in Table A.1 in the appendix section. Here among the cost coefficients aiand biare positive and ciis negative because of consideration of deregulated power system. As all the bidden cost functions are concave and cost functions are of non-convex type which makes the economic dispatch problem a negative definite quadratic programming problem to find the global maximum bidden cost instead of global minimum bidden cost. Three different load demand patterns of 8000, 8250 and 9000MW are considered for this test system of 40 generating units to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HCRO-DE method. For this test system bidden fuel cost function is optimized by individual DE, CRO and hybrid CRO-DE methods for the three individual load demands and the optimized results are tabulated in Table 11. The optimum results obtained by the DE, CRO and HCRO-DE algorithms are compared to those reported in the literature like GA [56], canonical PSO (CPSO) [56], hybrid PSO (HPSO) [56], NPSO-LRS [14], IFEP [8,55], velocity update relaxation momentum factor induced PSO (VURMFIPSO) [55], and crazynss PSO(CRAZYPSO) [56]. Tables 12–14give a comparison of the economic dispatch results of DE, CRO, HCRO-DE, GA [56], CPSO [56], HPSO [56], NPSO-LRS [14], IFEP [8,55], VURMFIPSO [55] and CRAZYPSO [56] for 8000, 8250 and 9000MW of load demands. It is clear from the Tables 12–14 that the fuel cost obtained by the proposed HCRO-DE method is comparatively less compared to all the other methods for all three load demands. Furthermore, the consistency of proposed HCRO-DE approach in attaining the near optimal value can also be noticed from Tables 12–14. Out of 50 trails, the success rate of HCRO-DE is higher compare to CRO and DE. Moreover, it is noted that the high-quality optimal solutions of the HCRO-DE method for this test system are obtained with even lower computation time than that of other methods. This indicates the computational efficiency of the proposed method for large scale deregulated test system. Hence, for ELD of deregulated power system, the proposed HCRO-DE method is proved to be the best algorithm amongst the eleven methods.Lastly, to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed hybrid CRO-DE optimization technique in solving the dynamic economic dispatch problem, it is applied on 3 generating units system. The dispatch horizon is chosen as one day with 24 dispatch intervals of each 1h. The generating unit fuel cost data, maximum and minimum power limits, transmission loss coefficients ramp rate limits and load demand for 24h are taken from [57]. The addition of the generation unit ramp rate limits (RRL), which restrict the change of the production of power in generating units between the hours of operation to a certain boundary, increases the difficulty of the path to the optimal solution. In order to check whether the constraints of the problem are satisfied or not, the obtained dispatch results of the HCRO-DE solution for 24h time horizon are given in Table 15. Due to space limitation, optimal power generation of each unit for 24h time schedule obtained by CRO and DE are not listed in simulation results. However, the comparative results of DE, CRO and HCRO-DE with respect to the BFO [57] and IBFO [57] are given in Table 16. From the simulation results given in Table 16, it is observed that the proposed HCRO-DE method reduces the total generation cost in more effective manner than original CRO, DE and the other heuristic methods reported in the literature. Also, the CPU time for this case for HCRO-DE for a population size of 50 is 15.56s. The CPU time for DE and CRO for the same population size is 16.85 and 17.17s, respectively. This clearly shows that HCRO-DE clearly outperforms the DE and CRO algorithms in terms of CPU time.The characteristics for the best, mean and worst cost convergences obtained by CRO, DE and hybrid CRO-DE algorithms for 6-unit, 10 unit, 13-unit with load of 1800 and 2520MW, 40-unit conventional power system, 40-unit restructured power system and dynamic ELD problems are shown in Figs. 1–7. The convergence characteristics are drawn by plotting the fuel cost from the population across iteration index. From Figs. 1–7, it is observed that the cost function value converges smoothly to the optimum value without any abrupt oscillations for DE, CRO and hybrid CRO-DE, thus ensuring convergence reliability of the proposed algorithms. However, it is observed that the hybrid CRO-DE converges much earlier as compared to individual CRO and DE algorithms.
