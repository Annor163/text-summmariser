@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper deals with the inverse Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) under inter-temporal dependence assumption. Both problems, input-estimation and output-estimation, are investigated. Necessary and sufficient conditions for input/output estimation are established utilizing Pareto and weak Pareto solutions of linear multiple-objective programming problems. Furthermore, in this paper we introduce a new optimality notion for multiple-objective programming problems, periodic weak Pareto optimality. These solutions are used in inverse DEA, and it is shown that these can be characterized by a simple modification in weighted sum scalarization tool.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is an important and widely-used nonparametric technique for evaluating the performance of Decision Making Units (DMUs) in a multiple-input multiple-output production technology. DEA was initially proposed by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR model) (Charnes, Cooper, & Rhodes, 1978). This technique has been used and developed by many scholars, see e.g. Cook and Seiford (2009), Cooper, Seiford, and Tone (1999) and Hatami-Marbini, Emrouznejad, and Tavana (2011) for some reviews. On the other hand, multiple-objective programming refers to optimizing more than one objective function over a feasible set (a set of feasible activities). This field of optimization has been studied and utilized in a wide variety of contexts, see e.g. Bhaskar, Gupta, and Ray (2000), Ehrgott (2005), Miettinen (1999), Soleimani-damaneh (2011), Steuer (1986) and the references therein. In this paper, we provide a new connection between these two fields to investigate inverse DEA which is an important problem from both theoretical and practical points of view.Inverse DEA was formally introduced at first in a worthwhile paper by Wei, Zhang, and Zhang (2000), to estimate the output levels under increasing inputs and preserving the efficiency score, though its idea was appeared in Zhang and Cui (1999). In Zhang and Cui (1999) the input increments of a DMU are measured for its given output increments under the CCR efficiency-fixed constraints. Wei et al. (2000) utilized multiple-objective programming techniques to estimate the desired output levels. Another inverse DEA problem was introduced by Hadi-Vencheh, Foroughi, and Soleimani-damaneh (2008). They used multiple-objective programming tools for input-estimating under increasing outputs and preserving the efficiency score. After introducing inverse DEA by Wei et al. (2000), this problem has been studied in many theoretical and applied publications, including Gattoufi, Amin, and Emrouznejad (in press), Hadi-Vencheh and Foroughi (2006), Hadi-Vencheh et al. (2008), Jahanshahloo, Hadi-Vencheh, Foroughi, and Kazemi Matin (2004), Jahanshahloo, Hosseinzadeh Lotfi, Shoja, Tohidi, and Razavyan (2005), Lin (2010), Lertworasirikul, Charnsethikul, and Fang (2011), Li and Cui (2008, 2013), Ghobadi and Jahangiri (in press), Yan, Wei, and Hao (2002).Although traditional DEA models evaluate the DMUs with static data without considering any time factor, in recent efforts some researchers have dealt with the assessing of Decision Making Units (DMUs) in the presence of time factor and inter-temporal dependence of input–output levels, by an analytical framework of DEA: dynamic DEA. Sengupta (1995) considered a dynamic extension of the inter-temporal cost frontier, when the input prices are subject to stochastic errors. Färe and Grosskopf (1996) presented some multi-period linear programming problems to introduce some dynamic aspects of production to their DEA models. Nemoto and Goto (1999) and Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2005) provided some dynamic production possibility set (PPS)-based models, considering the overall efficiency measure. Soleimani-damaneh (2013a, 2013b) presented some algorithms for estimating returns to scale and measuring efficiency by nonconvex dynamic DEA models. Tone and Tsutsui (2010) and Tone and Tsutsui (2014) provided some nonradial slack-based dynamic DEA models. In a practical study, Kawaguchi, Tone, and Tsutsui (2014) estimated the efficiency of Japanese hospitals using dynamic and network DEA models. In a recent and different work, Emrouznejad and Thanassoulis (2005) considered the changes in stock as a particular cause of inter-temporal input–output dependence and presented an envelopment dynamic DEA model to calculate the technical dynamic efficiency measures and find the efficient paths. The model provided by Emrouznejad and Thanassoulis (2005) was improved by Jahanshahloo, Soleimani-damaneh, and Reshadi (2006). In this paper, we deal with the inverse version of dynamic DEA model addressed in Emrouznejad and Thanassoulis (2005) and Jahanshahloo et al. (2006), and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for input-estimation and output-estimation under inter-temporally dependence assumption. The provided results are established utilizing Pareto and weak Pareto solutions of linear multiple-objective programming problems.Furthermore, in this paper we introduce a new optimality notion for multiple-objective programming problems, periodic weak Pareto optimality. It is shown that periodic weak Pareto solutions can be characterized by a simple manipulating in weighted sum scalarization tool. These points help us in solving the considered inverse DEA problems.The given results are important theoretically, because these provide new connections between DEA and multiple-objective programming. These are important practically as well, because these can be used for resource allocation (Hadi-Vencheh et al., 2008), sensitivity analysis (Jahanshahloo et al., 2005), preserve (improve) efficiency values (Lertworasirikul et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2002; Wei et al., 2000), setting revenue target (Lin, 2010), and merging the banks (Gattoufi et al., in press).The rest of the paper unfolds as follows: Section 2 gives some preliminaries from multiple-objective optimization and static inverse DEA. Section 3 contains a brief review on inter-temporal dependence. Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the main results of the paper. In these two sections, the input-estimation and output-estimation problems are dealt with, respectively. Section 6 gives a short conclusion.Letf:Rp⟶Rqandg:Rp⟶Rkbe two given vector-valued functions, i.e.,f(x)=(f1(x),f2(x),…,fq(x))andg(x)=(g1(x),g2(x),…,gk(x)). A general multiple-objective programming (MOP) problem is as(1)minf(x)s.t.gj(x)⩽0,j=1,2,…,k.The setX={x∈Rp:gj(x)⩽0,j=1,2,…,k}is called the set of feasible solutions of MOP (1).fjs are the objective functions of this MOP. There is usually no solutionx∈Xthat simultaneously minimizes all objective functions. Hence, (weak) Pareto solutions are defined instead of optimal solutions.Definition 2.1Ehrgott, 2005A feasible solutionx∗∈Xis called a Pareto solution to MOP (1) if there does not existxo∈Xsuch thatfj(xo)⩽fj(x∗)for eachj=1,2,…,q,fj(xo)<fj(x∗)for somej=1,2,…,q.A feasible solutionx∗∈Xis called a weak Pareto solution to MOP (1) if there does not existxo∈Xsuch thatfj(xo)<fj(x∗)for eachj=1,2,…,q.In static DEA, a set of DMUs,{DMUj:j=1,2,…,n}, is under evaluation in which DMUjconsumes multiple positive inputsxij(i=1,2,…,m)to produce multiple positive outputsyrj(r=1,2,…,s). Let inputs and outputs of DMUjbe denoted byXj=(x1j,x2j,…,xmj)tandYj=(y1j,y2j,…,ysj)t, respectively. We consider the following input-oriented DEA model, in whichDMUo,o∈{1,2,…,n}, is the unit under assessment:(2)θo=minθ,s.t.∑j=1nλjXj⩽θXo,∑j=1nλjYj⩾Yo,λj⩾0,j=1,2,…,n.This model is the first basic DEA model, provided by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (CCR model) (Charnes et al., 1978), and measures the efficiency under a constant returns to scale (CRS) assumption of the production technology.Model (2) is called the input-oriented CCR model. The output-oriented version of this model is as follows:(3)φo=maxφ,s.t.∑j=1nμjXj⩽Xo,∑j=1nμjYj⩾φYo,μj⩾0,j=1,2,…,n.Here,θoandφoare called the input-oriented and output-oriented efficiency scores of DMUo, respectively. It is not difficult to see thatθo⩽1andφo⩾1.DMUois called input- (resp. output-) oriented weakly efficient ifθo=1(resp.φo=1).The first study in inverse DEA has been done by Wei et al. (2000). They dealt with the following important question:Question 1 If the efficiency indexφoremains unchanged, but the inputs increase, how much should the outputs of DMUoincrease?To solve Question 1, suppose that the inputs of DMUoare increased fromXotoαo=Xo+ΔXo, whereΔXo⩾0andΔXo≠0. The aim of the problem is estimating the output vectorβo∗provided that the efficiency index of DMUois stillφo. In fact,βo∗=(β1o∗,β2o∗,…,βmo∗)t=Yo+ΔYo,ΔYo⩾0. Suppose DMUn+1represents DMUoafter changing the inputs and outputs. The following model measures the efficiency score of DMUn+1:(4)φn+1=maxφ,s.t.∑j=1nμjXj+μn+1αo⩽αo,∑j=1nμjYj+μn+1βo∗⩾φβo∗,μj⩾0,j=1,2,…,n+1.If the optimal values of Models (3) and (4) are equal, we say that the efficiency is unchanged, i.e.,φ(αo,βo∗)=φ(Xo,Yo). To solve Question 1, Wei et al. (2000) proposed the following multiple-objective linear programming (MOLP) problem:(5)max(β1o,β2o,…,βso),s.t.∑j=1nμjXj⩽αo,∑j=1nμjYj⩾φoβo,βo⩾Yo,μj⩾0,j=1,2,…,n.In the above model,(μ,βo)∈Rn×Rsis the variable vector. In this model,φois the optimal value of LP (3). The following theorem contains some of the main results of Wei et al. (2000). This theorem answers Question 1 when DMUois output-oriented inefficient (i.e.,φo>1).Theorem 2.1Wei et al., 2000Suppose thatφo>1and the inputs for DMUoare going to increase fromXotoαo=Xo+ΔXo, whereΔXo⩾0andΔXo≠0.(i)Let(μ∗,βo∗)be a Weak Pareto solution of MOLP(5). Then, when the outputs of DMUoare increased toβo∗we haveφ(αo,βo∗)=φ(Xo,Yo).Conversely, let(μ∗,βo∗)be a feasible solution of MOLP(5). Ifφ(αo,βo∗)=φ(Xo,Yo), then(μ∗,βo∗)is a Weak Pareto solution to MOLP(5).As mentioned, the above theorem deals with the case that DMUois not weakly efficient. For the caseφo=1, Wei et al. (2000) used a linear programming (LP) problem as follows:(6)φo+=maxφ,s.t.∑j=1nμjXj⩽αo,∑j=1nμjYj⩾φYo,μj⩾0,j=1,2,…,n.In the above model,(μ,φ)∈Rn×Ris the variable vector. The following theorem answers Question 1 when DMUois output-oriented efficient.Theorem 2.2Wei et al., 2000Suppose thatφo=1and the inputs for DMUoare going to increase fromXotoαo=Xo+ΔXo, whereΔXo⩾0andΔXo≠0. Thenφ(αo,φo+Yo)=φ(Xo,Yo), whereφo+is the optimal value of LP(6).After the initial work in inverse DEA by Wei et al. (2000), some scholars studied the problem more and provided various results in different frameworks, see, e.g. Gattoufi et al. (in press), Hadi-Vencheh and Foroughi (2006), Hadi-Vencheh et al. (2008), Jahanshahloo et al. (2004, 2005), Lin (2010), Lertworasirikul et al. (2011), and Yan et al. (2002). Hadi-Vencheh et al. (2008) investigated the following question in inverse DEA framework. This question follows the matter from a different standpoint.Question 2 If the efficiency indexθoremains unchanged, but the outputs increase, how much should the inputs of the DMUoincrease?To solve this problem, suppose the outputs of DMUoare increased fromYotoβo=Yo+ΔYo, whereΔYo⩾0andΔYo≠0. We need to estimate the input vectorαo∗provided that the efficiency index of DMUois stillθo. In fact,αo∗=(α1o∗,α2o∗,…,αmo∗)t=Xo+ΔXo,ΔXo⩾0. Suppose DMUn+1represents DMUoafter changing the inputs and outputs. The following model measures the efficiency score of DMUn+1:(7)minθ,s.t.∑j=1nλjXj+λn+1αo∗⩽θαo∗,∑j=1nλjYj+λn+1βo⩾βo,λj⩾0,j=1,…,n+1.The variables of the above model areθ,λ1,λ2,…,λn+1. If the optimal values of Models (2) and (7) are equal, we say that the efficiency is unchanged, i.e.θ(αo∗,βo)=θ(Xo,Yo).To solve Question 2, Hadi-Vencheh et al. (2008) considered the following MOLP problem:(8)min(α1o,α2o,…,αmo)s.t.∑j=1nλjXj⩽θoαo,∑j=1nλjYj⩾βo,αo⩾Xo,λj⩾0,j=1,…,n.The variables vector in MOLP (8) is(αo,λ), whileθois fixed. Hadi-Vencheh et al. (2008) established the following theorems.Theorem 2.3Hadi-Vencheh et al., 2008Suppose that(αo∗,λ∗)is a Pareto solution to MOLP(8). Then,θ(αo∗,βo)=θ(Xo,Yo).Suppose that(αo∗,λ∗)is a weak Pareto solution to MOLP(8)such thatαo∗>Xo, thenθ(αo∗,βo)=θ(Xo,Yo).Wei et al. (2000) and Hadi-Vencheh et al. (2008) presented their results for a unified DEA model which contains BCC (Banker, Charnes, & Cooper, 1984), FG (Färe & Grosskopf, 1985), and ST (Seiford & Thrall, 1990) models. It means the results discussed in this section hold for BCC, FG, and ST models as well, though here we considered only CCR model for simplicity.In this section, we review a mathematical programming model for efficiency measurement under inter-temporal dependent data. When the inter-temporal dependence occurs, the traditional DEA models may not be helpful (Emrouznejad & Thanassoulis, 2005). The situations in which data depend on the time and there are dependence between the data in different time periods are considered in a general framework which is called dynamic DEA. There are many dynamic DEA models in the literature, see, e.g., Emrouznejad and Thanassoulis (2005), Färe and Grosskopf (1996), Nemoto and Goto (1999), Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2005), Soleimani-damaneh (2013a, 2013b), and Sengupta (1995) among others. The situations at which inter-temporal dependence may happen can be divided into two cases. The first case is the situation at which the capital stock influences output levels over various production periods. This case has been studied by Emrouznejad and Thanassoulis (2005) and Jahanshahloo et al. (2006). The second situation refers to the production processes in which some outputs produced in a time period are utilized as inputs in the next period. This kind of problems has been studied by Nemoto and Goto (1999), Sueyoshi and Sekitani (2005), and Soleimani-damaneh (2013a, 2013b). In this paper, we study the inverse DEA problem for the first case, i.e. in our study, the inter-temporal dependence has been occurred by changing the capital stock among various production periods. The inverse DEA models for the latter case can be worth studying as well, though we do not pursue them in the present paper.In the following, we review the model given by Emrouznejad and Thanassoulis (2005), briefly. Let us to assume that there is a set of N DMUs, whose performance is assessed in a time horizon, say,t=1,2,…. Also considering a window of periods:t=τ,τ+1,…,τ+Tas assessment window, the set of inputs,I={1,2,…,m}is divided into two subsets:I1(period-specific inputs) andI2(capital inputs), whereI1,I2⊂I,I1∪I2=I,andI1∩I2=ϕ. The set of inputs is considered as:period-specific input paths1Hereafter, we use the notationxτ,τ+1,…,τ+Tinstead of(xτ,xτ+1,…,xτ+T)for simplicity. Similar notations will be used for other inputs/outputs as well.1:xτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,change in stock paths:zτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,initial-stock inputs:Zτ-1.output paths:yτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,terminal-stock inputs as outputs:Zτ+T.Here, each DMU consumes two kinds of inputs in each time period: usual inputs (denoted by x) and some resources taken from an existing storage/fund/ stock (denoted by z). For example, consider a number of universities as DMUs. Each university consumes different inputs, including the resources annually-taken from the government, tuition fee, and the educational spaces, to produce different outputs. In addition to the usual resources, the universities have some capital grants which are used when the managers are not able to continue by the usual resources. Such inputs are called capital stock and are denoted by z.As another example, assume that we want to analyze the performance of governments in an assessing window. A government governs the country consuming various normal resources, including tax incomes, exporting revenues, etc. Some countries, including Iran, have a National Development Fund (NDF). This fund has been established to transform oil and gas revenue to productive investment for future generation. In recent years, the government have utilized considerable money from the NDF (in Iran) which is a capital stock. This input is considered as changes in stock and is denoted by z.Therefore, when we consider τ as the initial time period in assessing window,Zjτ-1is the initial stock input for DMUj. For time period t, the quantityzjtstands for stock inputs used in period t by DMUj. Here,τ+Tis the terminal period in the assessing window, but the DMU survives after this period. Hence, having more terminal capital stock is desirable, because it can be used to produce outputs in future. Due to this, the terminal stock, denoted byZjτ+T, must be treated as output. This output is considered in addition to y, the goods produced by the DMU.According to the above discussion, the capital stock is used in addition to the usual inputs to produce a flow of outputs in future periods. Fig. 1clarifies the matter (see also Fig. 3 in Emrouznejad & Thanassoulis (2005)).It is clear thatZτ-1,Zτ+T, andztvalues satisfy the following equation:(9)Zτ-1=Zτ+T+∑t=ττ+Tzt.Let(xjτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zjτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,yjτ,τ+1,…,τ+T)denote the assessment path ofDMUj;j=1,2,…,Nin the considered assessment window. It is assumed that all input–output levels are positive. The efficient path is defined as follows.Definition 3.1Emrouznejad and Thanassoulis, 2005The assessment path of DMUois said to be efficient (dynamically efficient) if no other assessment path or combination of assessment paths yields more than the path of DMUoon at least one output in at least one period t;t=τ,τ+1,…,τ+T, without producing less in some other outputs in some periods or requiring more of at least one input in at least one period.Emrouznejad and Thanassoulis (2005) provided an LP problem for measuring the relative efficiency of an assessment path. Jahanshahloo et al. (2006) modified Emrouznejad and Thanassoulis’ model and suggested the following LP to ascertain whether the assessment path of DMUois dynamically efficient or not:(10)ϑo=min∑t=τT+τθtT+1,s.t.∑j=1Nλjxijt+sit=θtxiot,i∈I1,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjzijt+δit=θtziot,i∈I2,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjyrjt-srt=yrot,r=1,2,…,s,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1NλjZijτ+T-γi+=Zioτ+T,i∈I2,∑j=1NλjZijτ-1+γi-=Zioτ-1,i∈I2,θt⩽1,t=τ,τ+1,…,τ+T,λj,sit,srt,δit,γi+,γi-⩾0,for all indicesi,j,r,t.In the above model,θt,t=τ,τ+1,…,τ+Tandλj,j=1,2,…,Nare essential variables andsit,srt,δit,γi+,γi-are slack variables.The following theorem characterizes dynamically efficient paths utilizing Model (10). See Jahanshahloo et al. (2006).Theorem 3.1Jahanshahloo et al., 2006The assessment path of DMUois efficient, in the sense of definition 3.1, if and only ifϑo=1,sit=srt=δit=γi+=γi-=0,∀i,t,rfor all alternative optimal solutions of LP(10).In this section, we extend Question 2, provided by Hadi-Vencheh et al. (2008), to a dynamic framework. To this end, suppose the outputs of DMUoare increased fromyoτ,τ+1,…,τ+Ttoβoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=yoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T+Δyoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,whereΔyoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T⩾0andΔyoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T≠0. We need to estimate the input vector(αoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T)provided that the efficiency index of DMUois stillϑo. In fact,αoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=αioτ,τ+1,…,τ+T;i∈I1&ρioτ,τ+1,…,τ+T;i∈I2=xoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T+Δxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,Δzoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,in which(Δxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,Δzoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T)⩾0. Sincezotvalues may increase, due to Eq. (9), the initial and/or terminal capital stocks may also change. SinceZoτ+Tis considered as output here, we supply the increments ofzotvalues by increasing the initial capital stock,Zoτ-1. Therefore, we assume(11)Γoτ-1=Zoτ-1+▵Zoτ-1;▵Zoτ-1⩾0.To clarify the motivation of our work, we go back to two examples mentioned in the previous section. In the universities example, assume that the ministry of science asks some university to increase the number of publications and the number of PhD awards, preserving the efficiency position. It is clear that the university has to utilize more (usual and/or capital) resources to do this. The inverse DEA determine how much the resources should increase. As another instance, consider the government example. Some countries define targets for some criterion, which are wished to get in future. For example, the general policy in a country is increasing the literacy rate to 95% in 5 next years. The question is that, how much the input (period specific and changes in NDF) should be increased to get this goal. The problems studied in the present paper deal with such questions.SupposeDMUN+1represents the unit obtained after changing the inputs and outputs of DMUo. The following model measures the efficiency score ofDMUN+1:(12)ϑN+1=min∑t=τT+τθtT+1s.t.∑j=1Nλjxijt+λN+1αiot⩽θtαiot,i∈I1,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjzijt+λN+1ρiot⩽θtρiot,i∈I2,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjyrjt+λN+1βrot⩾βrot,r=1,2,…,s,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1NλjZijτ+T+λN+1Zioτ+T⩾Zioτ+T,i∈I2,∑j=1NλjZijτ-1+λN+1Γioτ-1⩽Γioτ-1,i∈I2,θt⩽1,t=τ,τ+1,…,τ+T,λj⩾0,j=1,2,…,N+1.Notice that, here period-specific input paths and also the quantities which express the changes in stock paths are changed. Also, the outputs and the initial-stock inputs have been changed. If the optimal values of Models (10) and (12) are equal, we say that the efficiency is unchanged, i.e.ϑαoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,βoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=ϑxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,yoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T.Notice that, according to Eq. (9), we have(13)Γoτ-1=Zoτ+T+∑t=ττ+Tρot.To solve the question, i.e. to estimate the inputs, along the lines of Hadi-Vencheh et al. (2008) and Wei et al. (2000), we consider the following MOLP model:(14)min(αiot;i∈I1&ρiot;i∈I2)t=τ,…,τ+T,s.t.∑j=1Nλjxijt⩽θt∗αiot,i∈I1,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjzijt⩽θt∗ρiot,i∈I2,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjyrjt⩾βrot,r=1,2,…,s,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1NλjZijτ+T⩾Zioτ+T,i∈I2,∑j=1NλjZijτ-1⩽Γioτ-1,i∈I2,Γoτ-1=Zoτ+T+∑t=ττ+Tρot,αot⩾xot,t=τ,…,τ+T,ρot⩾zot,t=τ,…,τ+T,λj⩾0,j=1,2,…,N.In this model,λ,αoτ,…,τ+T,ρoτ,…,τ+T,Γoτ-1is the variables vector.θt∗values are fixed and denote the optimal value ofθtvariables in Model (10). Also,βotis given and fixed. Notice that in the above MOLP,Γoτ-1⩾Zoτ-1automatically holds. Theorem 4.1 shows how the above MOLP can be used for input estimation.Theorem 4.1Let the assessment path of DMUobe efficient. Suppose thatΛ‾=λ‾,α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T,Γ‾oτ-1is a Pareto solution to MOLP(14)such that one of the following assumptions holds:(i)α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T=xoτ,…,τ+T,zoτ,…,τ+T,(ii)α‾ot≠xotfor each t.Thenϑα‾oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,βoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=ϑxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,yoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T.Since the assessment path of DMUois efficient, we haveθt∗=1for each t in Model (10), because of Theorem 3.1. To prove the theorem, we should show thatϑo=ϑN+1, consideringαoτ,…,τ+T,ρoτ,…,τ+T,Γoτ-1=α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T,Γ‾oτ-1in Model (12). Feasibility ofΛ‾for MOLP (14), implies∑j=1Nλ‾jxijt⩽α‾iot,i∈I1,t=τ,…,τ+T∑j=1Nλ‾jzijt⩽ρ‾iot,i∈I2,t=τ,…,τ+T∑j=1Nλ‾jyrjt⩾βrot,r=1,2,…,s,t=τ,…,τ+T∑j=1Nλ‾jZijτ+T⩾Zioτ+T,i∈I2∑j=1Nλ‾jZijτ-1⩽Γ‾ioτ-1,i∈I2λ‾j⩾0,j=1,2,…,N.Hence, the vector(λ=(λ‾,0),θt=θt∗,t=τ,…,τ+T)is a feasible solution to Model (12) (settingαot=α‾ot,ρot=ρ‾ot, andΓoτ-1=Γ‾oτ-1). Therefore,ϑN+1⩽ϑo.Considering(λ∗∗,λN+1∗∗,θt∗∗,t=τ,τ+1,…,τ+T)as an optimal solution to LP (12), we have(15)θt∗∗α‾ot⩾∑j=1Nλj∗∗xjt+λN+1∗∗α‾ot⩾∑j=1N(λj∗∗+λN+1∗∗λ‾j)xjt,(16)θt∗∗ρ‾ot⩾∑j=1Nλj∗∗zjt+λN+1∗∗ρ‾ot⩾∑j=1N(λj∗∗+λN+1∗∗λ‾j)zjt,and(17)∑j=1N(λj∗∗+λN+1∗∗λ‾j)yjt⩾∑j=1Nλj∗∗yjt+λN+1∗∗βot⩾βot⩾yot,for eacht=τ,…,τ+T. Furthermore,(18)∑j=1N(λj∗∗+λN+1∗∗λ‾j)Zjτ+T⩾∑j=1Nλj∗∗Zjτ+T+λN+1∗∗Zoτ+T⩾Zoτ+T,and(19)Γ‾oτ-1⩾∑j=1Nλj∗∗Zjτ-1+λN+1∗∗Γ‾oτ-1⩾∑j=1N(λj∗∗+λN+1∗∗λ‾j)Zjτ-1.Moreover,λj∗∗+λN+1∗∗λ‾j⩾0for each j. Setλ̃j≔λj∗∗+λN+1∗∗λ‾jfor each j.By contradiction assume thatϑN+1<ϑo. Therefore,∑t=ττ+Tθt∗∗<T+1. On the other hand,0<θt∗∗⩽1for each t. Therefore,θp∗∗<1for somep∈{τ,…,τ+T}.If assumption (ii) holds, thenα‾op≠xop. Without loss of generality, we assume thatα‾1op>x1op. By Eqs. (15) and (16), we have(20)∑j=1Nλ̃jxjp⩽θp∗∗α‾op<α‾op,(21)∑j=1Nλ̃jxjt⩽θt∗∗α‾ot⩽α‾ot=θt∗α‾ot,∀t≠p,(22)∑j=1Nλ̃jzjt⩽θt∗∗ρ‾ot⩽ρ‾ot=θt∗ρ‾ot,∀t.Defining(23)k=minmini∈I1{α‾iop-∑j=1Nλ̃jxijp},α‾1op-x1op,we havek>0. Now, for eachi∈I1andt=τ,…,τ+T, defineα̃iot=α‾iot-kifi=1,t=p,α‾iototherwise.Also, for eachi∈I2andt=τ,…,τ+T, defineρ̃iot=ρ‾iotandΓ̃ioτ-1=Γ‾ioτ-1.By (23), we have(24)∑j=1Nλ̃jxijp⩽α‾iop-k⩽α̃iop=θp∗α̃iop,for eachi∈I1.Ifi=1andt=p, thenk⩽α‾1op-x1op. Thusα̃1op=α‾1op-k⩾x1opin this case. Ifi≠1ort≠p, thenα̃iot=α‾iot⩾xiot. Therefore,(25)α̃ot⩾xot,for eacht=τ,…,τ+T. Also,(26)ρ̃ot=ρ‾ot⩾zot,for eacht=τ,…,τ+T. Furthermore,(27)Γ̃oτ-1=Zoτ+T+∑t=ττ+Tρ̃ot.Sinceλ̃⩾0, because of (17)–(27),Λ̃=λ̃,α̃oτ,…,τ+T,ρ̃oτ,…,τ+T,Γ̃oτ-1is a feasible solution to problem (14), whereα̃oτ,…,τ+T,ρ̃oτ,…,τ+T⩽α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T. Furthermore,α̃oτ,…,τ+T,ρ̃oτ,…,τ+T≠α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T, becauseα̃1op<α‾1op. This contradicts the Pareto optimality ofΛ‾and completes the proof under assumption (ii).If assumption (i) holds, then by (15)–(19), we get(28)∑j=1Nλ̃jxjt⩽θt∗∗α‾ot=θt∗∗xo,(29)∑j=1Nλ̃jzjt⩽θt∗∗ρ‾ot=θt∗∗zo,(30)∑j=1Nλ̃jyjt⩾βot⩾yot,for eacht=τ,…,τ+T. Furthermore,(31)∑j=1Nλ̃jZjτ+T⩾Zoτ+T,(32)∑j=1Nλ̃jZjτ-1⩽Γ‾oτ-1=Zoτ-1.Hence,λ̃⩾0and (28)–(32) imply thatλ̃,θt∗∗,t=τ,…,τ+Tis a feasible solution to LP (10). This impliesϑo⩽∑t=ττ+Tθt∗∗T+1<1, which contradicts the efficiency of the assessment path of DMUo.So, both cases lead to contradiction. Therefore,ϑN+1=ϑo, and the proof is completed.□The following example illustrates the result of Theorem 4.1.Example 4.1Consider three DMUs(A,B, andC), which consume a period-specific input, x, and a capital input, z, to produce an output, y. The performance is evaluated in a window of two periods,t1,t2. The data have been shown in Table 1.The efficiency score for all three DMUs is equal to one. Here, we considerDMUA, and we assume that its outputs have been increased from(2,4)to(5,7). Now, we want to estimate the inputs under preserving the efficiency score. MOLP (14) corresponding toDMUAis written as follows:(33)min(α1,α2,ρ1,ρ2),s.t.21λ1+21λ2+40λ3-α1⩽0,18λ1+18λ2+36λ3-α2⩽0,15λ1+15λ2+30λ3-ρ1⩽0,20λ1+20λ2+40λ3-ρ2⩽0,2λ1+4λ2+8λ3⩾5,4λ1+6λ2+12λ3⩾7,90λ1+90λ2+90λ3-Γ0⩽0,55λ1+55λ2+20λ3⩾55,α1⩾21,α2⩾18,ρ1⩾15,ρ2⩾20,Γ0-ρ1-ρ2=55,λ1,λ2,λ3⩾0.Using the weight-sum method (Ehrgott, 2005), we generated a Pareto solution for this MOLP as(α1=25.95,α2=22.50,ρ1=18.75,ρ2=25.00,Γ0=98.75).Therefore, due to Theorem 4.1, when the outputs ofDMUAincrease to(5,7)if we would like to preserve the efficiency score of this DMU, the inputs should increase to(25.95,18.75)in periodt=1, and(22.50,25.00)in periodt=2. Consequently, the initial capital stock should increase to 98.75.Theorem 4.1 will remain valid if one replaces the objective function of MOLP (14) with“min(αiot;i∈I1);t=τ,…,τ+T”.Due to the special structure of MOLP (14), we define a new optimality (efficiency) concept for this problem.Definition 4.1LetΛ=λ‾,α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T,Γ‾oτ-1be a feasible solution to MOLP (14). Λ is called a periodic weakly Pareto (PWP) solution to MOLP (14) if there does not exist another feasible solutionλ̃,α̃oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρ̃oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,Γ̃oτ-1and somep∈{τ,…,τ+T}such that(α̃op,ρ̃op)<(α‾op,ρ‾op), andα̃ot,ρ̃ot⩽α‾ot,ρ‾otfor eacht≠p.Let the set of PWP solutions of MOLP (14) be denoted byXP. Also, assume thatXEandXWdenote the set of Pareto solutions and weak Pareto solutions of MOLP (14), respectively. It is clear thatXE⊆XP⊆XW. This shows that periodic weakly Pareto optimality is a notion between the weak Pareto optimality and Pareto optimality.Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 give converse versions of Theorem 4.1. Notice that, unlike Theorem 4.1, Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 hold in general case without assuming the efficiency of the assessment path of DMUo.Theorem 4.2LetΛ=λ‾,α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T,Γ‾oτ-1be a feasible solution to MOLP(14)such thatϑα‾oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,βoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=ϑxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,yoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T.Then Λ is a periodic weak Pareto solution to MOLP(14).Ifλ‾,α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T,Γ‾oτ-1is not a periodic weak Pareto solution of MOLP (14), then there exists another feasible solutionλ̃,α̃oτ,…,τ+T,ρ̃oτ,…,τ+T,Γ̃oτ-1and somep∈{τ,…,τ+T}, such thatα̃op,ρ̃op<α‾op,ρ‾opandα̃ot,ρ̃ot⩽α‾ot,ρ‾otfor eacht≠p. Therefore,Γ̃oτ-1⩽Γ‾oτ-1, and(34)∑j=1Nλ̃jxjp⩽θp∗α̃op<θp∗α‾op,(35)∑j=1Nλ̃jzjp⩽θp∗ρ̃op<θp∗ρ‾op,(36)∑j=1Nλ̃jxjt⩽θt∗α̃ot⩽θt∗ρ‾ot,t≠p,(37)∑j=1Nλ̃jzjt⩽θt∗ρ̃ot⩽θt∗ρ‾ot,t≠p,(38)∑j=1Nλ̃jyjt⩾βot,t=τ,…,τ+T,(39)∑j=1Nλ̃jZjτ+T⩾Zoτ+T,(40)∑j=1Nλ̃jZjτ-1⩽Γ̃oτ-1⩽Γ‾oτ-1,(41)λ̃j⩾0,j=1,…,N.By inequalities (34) and (35), there exists positive scalarkp<1such that(42)∑j=1Nλ̃jxjp⩽(kpθp∗)α‾opand∑j=1Nλ̃jzjp⩽(kpθp∗)ρ‾op.According to Eqs. (36)–(42), the vectorλ=λ̃,λN+1=0,θp=kpθp∗,θt=θt∗,t≠pis a feasible solution to LP (12) (consideringαot=α‾ot,ρot=ρ‾ot, andΓoτ-1=Γ‾oτ-1in LP (12)). The value of the objective function of LP (12) at this feasible point is equal to1T+1kpθp∗+∑t≠pθt∗. Therefore,ϑN+1⩽1T+1kpθp∗+∑t≠pθt∗<1T+1∑t=ττ+Tθt∗=ϑo.This contradicts the assumption and completes the proof.□The following result is a direct consequence of Theorem 4.2 because ofXP⊆XW.Theorem 4.3LetΛ=λ‾,α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T,Γ‾oτ-1be a feasible solution to MOLP(14)such thatϑα‾oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,βoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=ϑxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,yoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T.Then Λ is a weak Pareto solution to MOLP(14).There are many approaches in multiple-objective optimization literature to obtain (approximate or characterize) weakly Pareto solutions of MOLPs, see, e.g. Ehrgott (2005) and the references there in.We close this section with a discussion about periodic weak Pareto solutions.The following example addresses a situation in which the inclusionsXE⊆XP⊆XWare strict.Example 4.2ConsiderX={A,B,C}⊆R4in whichA=(2,5,4,3)T,B=(1,5,3,3)T, andC=(2,5,4,4)T. Assume that the multiple-objective programming problem is to minimize four objective functions asf1(x)=x1,f2(x)=x2,f3(x)=x3,andf4(x)=x4,on X. Furthermore it is assumed that there are two time periodst1andt2. The objective functionsf1,f2are considered corresponding to the periodt1while the objective functionsf3,f4are corresponding to the periodt2.It can be seen thatXE={B},XP={A,B}, andXW={A,B,C}.□The proof of the following theorem is not difficult and is hence omitted.Theorem 4.4(i)If there exists only one objective function in each period, thenXE=XP.If the number of periods is equal to one, thenXP=XW.In the single-objective programming problems we haveXE=XP=XW.The following theorem shows that weight-sum technique (Ehrgott, 2005; Isermann, 1977; Steuer, 1986), which is a standard widely-used scalarization tool, can be used to characterize periodic weak Pareto solutions.The most important point in this result is that, all of the weights are not positive necessarily and at least one component of the weight vector corresponding to each period must be positive.Theorem 4.5LetΛ=λ‾,α‾oτ,…,τ+T,ρ‾oτ,…,τ+T,Γ‾oτ-1be a feasible solution to MOLP(14). Λ is a periodic weakly Pareto solution of MOLP(14)if and only if there existnonzero nonnegativeweight row-vectors(ντ,ωτ),(ντ+1,ωτ+1),…,(ντ+T,ωτ+T)∈R|I1|×R|I2|such that Λ is an optimal solution to the following LP:(43)min∑t=ττ+Tνtαot+∑t=ττ+Tωtρots.t.The constraints of MOLP(14).If Λ is not a periodic weak Pareto solution to MOLP (14), then there exists a feasible solution to this MOLP (and hence feasible to LP (43)), sayΛ^=λ^,α^oτ,…,τ+T,ρ^oτ,…,τ+T,Γ^oτ-1, and somep∈{τ,…,τ+T}such thatα^op,ρ^op<α‾op,ρ‾opandα^ot,ρ^ot⩽α‾ot,ρ‾otfor eacht≠p.Since the weight vectors are nonzero and nonnegative, we haveνpα^op+ωpρ^op<νpα‾op+ωpρ‾opandνtα^ot+ωtρ^ot⩽νtα‾ot+ωtρ‾otfor eacht≠p. This leads to∑t=ττ+Tνtα^ot+∑t=ττ+Tωtρ^ot<∑t=ττ+Tνtα‾ot+∑t=ττ+Tωtρ‾ot.Therefore, Λ is not optimal for LP (43).Conversely, assume that Λ is a periodic weak Pareto solution to MOLP (14). Now, we construct an auxiliary LP as follows:(44)max∑t=ττ+Tαt,s.t.The constraints of MOLP(14),αiot+αt=α‾io,i∈I1,t=τ,…,τ+T,ρiot+αt=ρ‾io,i∈I2,t=τ,…,τ+T,αt⩾0,t=τ,…,τ+T.In this model,αtis a scalar variable corresponding to the time period t. Since Λ is a periodic weak Pareto solution to MOLP (14), the optimal value of the above LP is zero.Writing the dual of LP (44) and following a manner similar to the proof of Theorem 6.11 in Ehrgott (2005) (proved by Isermann (1986) at first), we obtain nonnegative weight row-vectorsντ,ντ+1,…,ντ+T∈R|I1|andωτ,ωτ+1,…,ωτ+T∈R|I2|such that Λ is an optimal solution to LP (43) and furthermore,∑i∈I1νit+∑i∈I2ωit⩾1for each t. These complete the proof.□This section is devoted to extending Question 1, provided by Wei et al. (2000), to a dynamic setting. Suppose the inputs of DMUoare increased from(xoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T)toαoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=xoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T+Δxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,Δzoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,whereΔxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,Δzoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T⩾0,Δxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,Δzoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T≠0.Here, the increment ofzotvalues is supplied by increasingZoτ-1. Hence, due to Eq. (9), the initial stock input has to increase toΓoτ-1=Zoτ+T+∑t=ττ+Tρot.We need to estimate the output vectorβoτ,τ+1,…,τ+Tprovided that the efficiency index of DMUois unchanged. In fact,βoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=yoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T+Δyoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,in whichΔyoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T⩾0.SupposeDMUN+1represents the unit obtained after changing the inputs and outputs of DMUo. LPs (45) and (46) measure the (output-oriented) efficiency scores of DMUoand DMUN+1, respectively.(45)Φo=max∑t=τT+τφtT+1,s.t.∑j=1Nλjxijt⩽xiot,i∈I1,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjzijt⩽ziot,i∈I2,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjyrjt⩾φtyrot,r=1,2,…,s,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1NλjZijτ+T⩾Zioτ+T,i∈I2,∑j=1NλjZijτ-1⩽Zioτ-1,i∈I2,φt⩾1,t=τ,τ+1,…,τ+T,λj⩾0,j=1,2,…,n.(46)ΦN+1=max∑t=τT+τφtT+1s.t.∑j=1Nλjxijt+λN+1αiot⩽αiot,i∈I1,t=τ,…,τ+T∑j=1Nλjzijt+λN+1ρiot⩽ρiot,i∈I2,t=τ,…,τ+T∑j=1Nλjyrjt+λN+1βrot⩾φtβrot,r=1,2,…,s,t=τ,…,τ+T∑j=1NλjZijτ+T+λN+1Zioτ+T⩾Zioτ+T,i∈I2∑j=1NλjZijτ-1+λN+1Γoτ-1⩽Γioτ-1,i∈I2φt⩾1,t=τ,τ+1,…,τ+T,λj⩾0,j=1,2,…,N+1.If the optimal values of Models (45) and (46) are equal, then we say that the efficiency is unchanged, i.e.Φαoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,βoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=Φxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,yoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T.To estimate the output vectorβoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T, we consider the following MOLP problem:(47)max(βrot;r=1,2,…,s)t=τ,…,τ+T,s.t.∑j=1Nλjxijt⩽αiot,i∈I1,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjzijt⩽ρiot,i∈I2,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1Nλjyrjt⩾φt∗βrot,r=1,2,…,s,t=τ,…,τ+T,∑j=1NλjZijτ+T⩾Zioτ+T,i∈I2,∑j=1NλjΓijτ-1⩽Γioτ-1,i∈I2,βot⩾yot,t=τ,…,τ+T,λj⩾0,j=1,2,…,N.In this model(λ,βoτ,…,τ+T)is the variables vector.φt∗values are fixed and denote the optimal value ofφtvariables in Model (45). Theorem 5.1 shows how one can use the solutions of the above MOLP for output estimation.Theorem 5.1Let the assessment path of DMUobe efficient. Suppose thatΛ‾=λ‾,β‾oτ,…,τ+Tis a periodic weakly Pareto solution of MOLP(47). ThenΦαoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,β‾oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=Φxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,yoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T.Since the assessment path of DMUois efficient, we haveφt∗=1for each t in Model (45). To prove the theorem, we should show thatΦo=ΦN+1. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1, it can be seen thatΦN+1⩾Φo.Consideringλ∗∗,λN+1∗∗,θt∗∗,t=τ,τ+1,…,τ+Tas an optimal solution of LP (46), setλ̃j≔λj∗∗+λN+1∗∗λ‾jfor eachj=1,2,…,N. Similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1, we get(48)∑j=1Nλ̃jxjt⩽αot,∑j=1Nλ̃jzjt⩽ρot,∑j=1Nλ̃jyjt⩾φt∗∗β‾ot⩾β‾ot=φt∗β‾ot,for each t, and(49)∑j=1Nλ̃jZjτ+T⩾Zoτ+T,∑j=1Nλ̃jΓjτ-1⩽Γoτ-1.Moreover,λ̃j∗∗⩾0for eachj=1,…,N. By contradiction assume thatΦN+1>Φo. Therefore,φp∗∗>1for somep∈{τ,…,τ+T}. Therefore,(50)∑j=1Nλ̃jyjp⩾φp∗∗β‾op>β‾op=φt∗β‾op.Now defining(51)k=minr∑j=1Nλ̃jyrjp-β‾rop,andβ̃rot=β‾rot+kift=p,β‾rototherwise,we havek>0, and the vector(λ̃,β̃o)is a feasible solution to problem (47) which contradicts the periodic weak Pareto efficiency ofΛ‾.□It is not difficult to see that the above theorem is valid if one replaces the “periodic weak Pareto” assumption with “Pareto” assumption.Theorem 5.2 is a converse version of Theorem 5.1. Unlike Theorem 5.1, Theorem 5.2 holds in general case without assuming the efficiency of the assessment path of DMUo. The proof of this theorem is similar to that of Theorem 4.2.Theorem 5.2LetΛ=λ‾,β‾oτ,…,τ+Tbe a feasible solution to MOLP(47)such thatΦαoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,ρoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,β‾oτ,τ+1,…,τ+T=Φxoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,zoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T,yoτ,τ+1,…,τ+T.Then Λ is a (periodic) weak Pareto solution to MOLP(47).Although in this paper we considered the studied models under CRS assumption of the production technology, the given results are still valid under variable, non-increasing and non-decreasing returns to scale assumptions (Banker et al., 1984; Färe & Grosskopf, 1985 & Seiford & Thrall, 1990) as well.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we extended the inverse DEA problems for input/output estimation under inter-temporal dependence assumption on the data set. We used (weak) Pareto solutions of some linear multiple-objective programming problems to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for input/output estimation. Also, a new optimality notion (periodic weak Pareto optimality) for linear MOLP problems was introduced and investigated.The given results provide new connections between DEA and multiple-objective programming. Furthermore, these can be used for practical purposes, including resource allocation, sensitivity analysis, preserve (improve) efficiency values, setting revenue target, and merging the banks.Although we established the necessary conditions in general case, the given sufficient conditions are only for dynamically efficient paths. Obtaining sufficient conditions for dynamically inefficient paths (units) can be a worthwhile direction for further research.
