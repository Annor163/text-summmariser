@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Generalized characteristic functions extend characteristic functions of ‘classical’ TU-games by assigning a real number to every ordered coalition being a permutation of any subset of the player set. Such generalized characteristic functions can be applied when the earnings or costs of cooperation among a set of players depend on the order in which the players enter a coalition.In the literature, the two main solutions for generalized characteristic functions are the one of Nowak and Radzik (1994), shortly called NR-value, and the one introduced by Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), shortly called SB-value. In this paper, we introduce the axiom of order monotonicity with respect to the order of the players in a unanimity coalition, requiring that players who enter earlier should get not more in the corresponding (ordered) unanimity game than players who enter later. We propose several classes of order monotonic solutions for generalized characteristic functions that contain the NR-value and SB-value as special (extreme) cases. We also provide axiomatizations of these classes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Generalized characteristic functions on a player set N, introduced by Nowak and Radzik (1994), extend characteristic functions of ‘classical’ TU-games by assigning a real number to every ordered coalition of N. Here an ordered coalition of N is a permutation of any subset of N. Classical characteristic functions form the special class where the real number or worth assigned to any ordered coalition only depends on the players that are part of this ordered coalition, i.e. it does not matter in which order the players enter the coalition. Generalized characteristic functions can be used in situations where the worth (or cost) that can be generated by a set of players depends on the order in which the players enter.Consider, for example, the airport games of Littlechild and Owen (1973) to allocate the building and maintenance costs of airport landing strips, see also Littlechild and Thompson (1977). An airport cost situation consists of a set of airplanes (being the players in the game) and for each airplane a nonnegative cost of the airline strip that is necessary for this airplane to land. Since the airplanes are different they need landing strips of different length. In the associated airport game, the worth of a coalition (being a subset of the set of airplanes N) is the cost of the airline strip needed for the largest airplane in this coalition (assuming that larger airplanes need longer and more expensive landing strips).1Instead of airplanes, in an airport game every airplane landing is a player but for convenience we simply call these airplanes.1But this means that building a landing strip of a certain size does not depend on the order in which the airplanes enter the coalition. The worth (cost) of a coalition is always fully determined by the cost for the largest airplane in the coalition. However, in real life construction industry it is usually more expensive to build a project in several steps than to build it fully at once. For example, when one wants to extend an existing landing strip then all the machinery has to be brought back to the airport, everything needs to be setup again, maybe some reconstruction or preparation needs to be done before being able to extend the existing landing strip. Then it would have been less costly to have built the longer landing strip at once. Therefore, instead of modelling an airport cost problem on n airplanes by an n-dimensional cost vectorc∈R+Nwhich ith component is the cost of building an airline strip suitable for airplane i, it seems more realistic to model it by ann×ndimensional cost matrix C, which first column coincides with the above mentioned cost vector c (i.e. the first column gives the cost for building the airline strip for i when there is nothing built yet), and whichijth componentcij,i∈{1,…,n},j∈{2,…,n}, is the cost of building (extending) an airline strip suitable for airplane i when the landing strip is built already for airplanej-1(and smaller airplanes). So, we might consider the first column as a standard airport cost problem.Example 1.1Suppose that there are three airplanesN={1,2,3}, where the costs of building an airline strip for airplanei∈Nis given by cost vectorc=(ci)i∈N=(1,3,4). However, it can be that extending the airline strip for airplane 1 to one for airplane 2 costs 3 additional to the cost made to build the already existing airline strip. If, further extending the airline strip for airplane 1 to one for airplane 3 costs 3, and extending the airline strip for airplane 2 to one for airplane 3 costs 2, this can be represented by cost matrixC=100330432.Such an airport cost problem, where the cost of the landing strip depends on the order in which airplanes announce that they want to use the landing strip, cannot be modelled by a classical TU-game. Although the entrance of an airplane that is not larger than the largest airplane in the coalition does not change the worth, when an airplane larger than the largest airplane in the coalition enters, then the additional cost depends on which is the largest airplane in the already existing coalition. Such generalized airport cost problems can be modeled by a generalized characteristic function where the worth of an ordered coalition of airplanes is the cost of the landing strip if it would be built sequentially, in each step being large enough to allow the corresponding airplane to land.In the literature, the two main solutions for generalized characteristic functions are the one of Nowak and Radzik (1994), which we will call the NR-value, and the one introduced by Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) and generalized in Sánchez and Bergantiños (2001), which we refer to as the SB-value. Both solutions extend the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953) of classical TU-games in the sense that for a generalized characteristic function that represents a classical characteristic function they yield the Shapley value of that classical game.2The Shapley value is one of the most relevant solutions concept in cooperative game theory. Kamijo and Kongo (2012) compare this value with some other relevant ones. Moretti and Patrone (2008) is an excellent survey on the transversality of the Shapley value. Extensions of the Shapley value also have been considered in other generalizations of the standard TU-game model, for example for fuzzy games in e.g. Tsurumi, Tanino, and Inuiguchi (2001) and Li and Zhang (2009), games in partition function form in e.g. Grabisch and Funaki (2012), TU-games with awards in Lorenzo-Freire, Alonso-Meijide, Casas-Méndez, and Hendrickx (2007), and games where cooperation is restricted by certain combinatorial structures such as communication structures in Myerson (1980), probabilistic communication situations in Gómez, González-Arangüena, Manuel, and Owen (2008), convex geometries in Bilbao (1998), antimatroids in Algaba, Bilbao, van den Brink, and Jiménez-Losada (2003) and augmenting systems in Bilbao and Ordóñez (2009).2In this paper we criticize some axioms underlying these two solutions and we propose a new axiom, called order monotonicity, and use it to characterize a class of solutions that contains the NR-value and the SB-value as extreme cases. Moreover, we revisit the parametric family of geometric solutions for generalized characteristic functions introduced in del Pozo, Manuel, González-Arangüena, and Owen (2011) and we characterize it.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains preliminaries on games in generalized characteristic function and games with a permission structure. In Section 3 we introduce the new axiom of order monotonicity and use it to define a new class of solutions for games in generalized characteristic functions. In Section 4 we discuss the special class of the so-called geometric solutions. Finally, Section 5 contains concluding remarks.A situation in which a finite set of playersN⊂Ncan generate certain payoffs by cooperation can be described by a cooperative game in characteristic function form (also known as cooperative game with transferable utility or simply TU-game) being a pair(N,vˆ)where the characteristic functionvˆ:2N→Ris a real function defined on2N(the set of all subsets of N), that satisfiesvˆ(∅)=0. For each coalitionS∈2N, the worthvˆ(S)represents the (transferable) utility that players in S can obtain if they decide to cooperate. When there is no ambiguity with respect to the players set N, we will identify the game(N,vˆ)with its characteristic functionvˆ. In the sequel we will denote the cardinality of coalitionsS,T,R∈2Nby lower cases,t,r. We will denote byGNthe set of all characteristic functions with player set N. It is well-known thatGNis a2n-1dimensional vector space,n=|N|, with the unanimity gamesuˆS∅≠S⊂Nas basis. For everyS⊆N,S≠∅, the unanimity gameuˆSis defined byuˆS(T)=1ifS⊆T, anduˆS(T)=0, otherwise. For a givenvˆ∈GN, the unanimity coefficients (i.e. the coordinates ofvˆin the unanimity basis){Δvˆ(T)}∅≠T⊂Nare given by (see Harsanyi (1959))(2.1)Δvˆ(T)=∑R⊆T(-1)t-rvˆ(R),∅≠T⊆N.A solution or value for TU-games is a function which assigns a payoff vectorx∈RNto every TU-game inGN. One of the most famous solutions is the Shapley value (Shapley, 1953),φSh, which is given by:φiSh(N,vˆ)=∑S⊆N⧹{i}(n-s-1)!s!n!(vˆ(S∪{i})-vˆ(S)),foralli∈N.Nowak and Radzik (1994) introduced the concept of game in generalized characteristic function form where the order in which a coalition is formed influences the worth that can be generated. For eachS∈2N⧹{∅}, letΠ(S)denote the set of all permutations or ordered coalitions of the players in S and, for notational convenience,Π(∅)={∅}. We denoteΩ(N)=T∈Π(S)|S⊆Nas the set of all ordered coalitions with players in N. A game in generalized characteristic function form is a pair(N,v),Nbeing the player set andv:Ω(N)→Ra real function (the generalized characteristic function), defined onΩ(N)and satisfyingv(∅)=0.For eachS⊆N, and for every ordered coalitionT∈Π(S),v(T)represents the economic possibilities of the players in S if the coalition is formed following the order given by T.Example 2.1Consider the generalized airport cost problem of Example 1.1. The corresponding generalized characteristic function isv(1)=1,v(2)=v(21)=3,v(3)=v(31)=v(32)=v(312)=v(321)=4,v(12)=1+3=4,v(13)=v(132)=1+3=4,v(23)=v(213)=v(231)=3+2=5andv(123)=1+3+2=6.We denote byGNthe set of all generalized characteristic functions with player set N, andG={(N,v)|N⊂N,v∈GN}. As in the case of games inGN, we will sometimes identify the game with its characteristic function.Given an ordered coalitionT∈Ω(N), there existsS⊆Nsuch thatT∈Π(S). We will denote byH(T)=Sthe set of players in the ordered coalition T, andt=|H(T)|(if there is no confusion with|T|). Each ordered coalitionT=(i1,…,it)∈Ω(N)establishes a strict linear order≺TinH(T), defined as follows: for alli,j∈H(T),i≺Tj(i precedes j in T) if and only if there existk,l∈{1,…,t},k<l, such thati=ik,j=il.Given two ordered coalitionsT,R∈Ω(N), we denoteT⊆∼Rif and only if:(a)H(T)⊆H(R), and∀i,j∈H(T),i≺Tjimpliesi≺Rj.It is known thatGNis a vector space with dimension|Ω(N)|-1where the generalized unanimity games{wT}∅≠T∈Ω(N)form a basis ofGN. For everyT∈Ω(N), the generalized unanimity gamewTis defined bywT(R)=1ifT⊂∼R, andwT(R)=0otherwise.For a givenv∈GN, Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) proved that the generalized unanimity coefficients (i.e. the coordinates of v in the generalized unanimity basis){Δv∗(T)}∅≠T∈Ω(N)are given by(2.2)Δv∗(T)=∑R⊂∼T(-1)t-rv(R),T∈Ω(N)⧹{∅}.Observe that there exists an isomorphism between the vector spaceGNand the subspace ofGNconsisting of all games for whichv(T)=v(R)ifH(T)=H(R)holds, i.e. the order in which the coalitions are formed is irrelevant. Forv∈GNandS⊂Nwe define the subgame(S,v|S)byv|S(T)=v(T)for allT∈Ω(S).For ordered coalitionT∈Ω(N)letj(T)∈{1,…,t}be the position of playerj∈H(T)in T. So, forT=(i1,i2,…,it)we haveik(T)=kfor allk∈{1,…,t}. For playeri∈N⧹H(T), let(T,il),l∈{1,…,t+1}, be the ordered coalition that is obtained from T by putting i on thelth position and moving all players on position l or higher one position backwards. So,i(T,il)=l,j(T,il)=j(T)for allj∈H(T)withj(T)∈{1,…,l-1}, andj(T,il)=j(T)+1for allj∈H(T)withj(T)∈{l,…,t}.A solution for generalized characteristic functions is a function defined onGthat assigns to every(N,v)∈Ga vector inRN. In their seminal paper, Nowak and Radzik (1994) define and characterize a solution for generalized characteristic functions. This solution, which we will refer to as the Nowak–Radzik value, or shortly NR-value, is the solutionψNRassigning to every generalized characteristic function(N,v)the payoffsψiNR(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N⧹{i})(n-t-1)!n!(v(T,it+1)-v(T)),foralli∈N.An alternative expression for this solution (based on the generalized unanimity coefficients of v) is:ψiNR(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)i(T)=tΔv∗(T)t!,foralli∈N.Later, Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) define and study another solution for generalized characteristic functions, which we call the Sánchez–Bergantiños value or shortly SB-value. This solution assigns to every generalized characteristic function the payoffsψSB(N,v)given byψiSB(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N⧹{i})(n-t-1)!n!(t+1)∑l=1t+1(v(T,il)-v(T)),foralli∈N.An alternative expression (based on the generalized unanimity coefficients of v) is:ψiSB(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)i∈H(T)1t!tΔv∗(T)foralli∈N.Note that both the NR-value as well as the SB-value generalize the Shapley value for TU-games in the sense that they yield the Shapley value if the worth of every ordered coalition only depends on the players belonging to it.Nowak and Radzik (1994) axiomatize their value by the following three axioms. First, they define efficiency stating that the sum of the payoffs allocated over the players should be equal to the average worth of the ‘grand coalition’ N when every order or permutation in which N is formed is equally likely. Obviously, this efficiency will never be realized since eventually only one order of entrance will occur. Since, behind a ‘veil of ignorance’ it is assumed that each order is equally likely to occur, we refer to this efficiency axiom as expected efficiency and it states that the sum of payoffs equals the ex ante expected worth.Axiom 2.2Expected efficiencyFor every(N,v)∈G, it holds that∑i∈Nψi(N,v)=1n!∑T∈Π(N)v(T).Second, linearity is standard.Axiom 2.3LinearityFor every(N,v),(N,w)∈Ganda,b∈Rit holds thatψ(N,av+bw)=aψ(N,v)+bψ(N,w), where(N,av+bw)∈Gis given by(av+bw)(T)=a·v(T)+b·w(T)for allT∈Ω(N).Third, a player is a NR-null player in generalized characteristic function(N,v)∈Gif it always adds zero to any ordered coalition when it enters last in the coalition,3Nowak and Radzik (1994) call such a player simply a null player, but since we will later use the null player notion of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), we call this a NR-null player.3i.e. ifv(T,it+1)=v(T)for allT∈Ω(N⧹{i}).Axiom 2.4NR-null player propertyIfi∈Nis a NR-null player in(N,v)∈Gthenψi(N,v)=0.Nowak and Radzik (1994) show that their value is the unique solution satisfying these three axioms.Theorem 2.5Nowak and Radzik (1994, Theorem 1)A solutionψsatisfies expected efficiency, linearity and the NR-null player property if and only ifψ=ψNR.Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) criticize the NR-null player property by arguing that a player is a NR-null player even when it contributes to an ordered coalition incorporating in positions different from the last one. Instead of only considering the contributions to a coalition when a player enters as last one, Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) consider the effect on the worth of a coalition of a player leaving in any position in the ordered coalition. Then, they call a player that contributes nothing when incorporating to any coalition in any position, a null player. Since we will use this weaker notion of a null player, we say the player i in N is a null player in(N,v)∈Gifv(T,il)=v(T)for allT∈Ω(N⧹{i})andl∈{1,…,t+1}. The null player property then states that such a player earns a zero payoff.Axiom 2.6Null player propertyIfi∈Nis a null player in(N,v)∈Gthenψi(N,v)=0.Since this null player property is weaker than the NR-null player property, Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) added a symmetry axiom, requiring that symmetric players earn the same payoff. Playersi,j∈Nare symmetric in(N,v)∈Gifv(T,il)=v(T,jl)for allT∈Ω(N⧹{i,j})andl∈{1,…,t+1}.Axiom 2.7SymmetryIfi,j∈Nare symmetric players in(N,v)∈Gthenψi(N,v)=ψj(N,v).A solutionψsatisfies expected efficiency, linearity, the null player property and symmetry if and only ifψ=ψSB.In del Pozo et al. (2011), the parametric family of geometric solutions for generalized characteristic functions is introduced (and used to define centrality measures for directed networks). Givenα∈[0,1], the solutionψαis given by(2.3)ψiα(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)i∈H(T)αt-i(T)t!∑l=0t-1αlΔv∗(T)foralli∈N.This class contains the NR-valueψNR=ψ0by takingα=0, as well as the SB-valueψSB=ψ1by takingα=1as extreme cases.In a (cooperative) game with a permission structure, see Gilles, Owen, and van den Brink (1992), van den Brink and Gilles (1996), Gilles and Owen (1999) and van den Brink (1997), it is assumed that players who participate in a cooperative TU-game (in characteristic function form) are part of a hierarchical organization in which there are players that need permission or approval from certain other players before they are allowed to cooperate. For a finite set of players N such a hierarchical organization is represented by a directed graph(N,D)withD⊆N×N, referred to as a permission structure on N. The directed links(i,j)∈Dare called arcs. The players inFD(i)≔{j∈N|(i,j)∈D}are called the followers or successors of player i, while the players inPD(i)≔{j∈N|(j,i)∈D}are called the predecessors of i in D. A triple(N,vˆ,D)withvˆ:2N→Rsuch thatv(∅)=0, and(N,D)a digraph is called a game with a permission structure.In the conjunctive approach as developed in Gilles et al. (1992) and van den Brink and Gilles (1996), it is assumed that the permission structure restricts the cooperation possibilities of the players in the sense that we assume that a coalition is feasible if and only if for every player in the coalition all its predecessors are also in the coalition. The set of feasible coalitions in this approach thus is given byΦN,Dc≔S⊆N|PD(i)⊂Sforalli∈S.For every other coalition it is assumed that it can generate the worth of its largest feasible subset4Every coalition having a unique largest feasible subset follows from the fact thatΦN,Dcis union closed.4which is given byσN,Dc(S)=⋃{T∈ΦN,Dc|T⊆S}T=S⧹(⋃i∈N⧹SFD(i)). This is referred to as the conjunctive sovereign part of S. Given a game with a permission structure(N,vˆ,D), the conjunctive restriction ofvˆon D is the characteristic functionrN,vˆ,Dc:2N→Rgiven byrN,vˆ,Dc(S)=vˆ(σN,Dc(S))for allS⊆N.5Note that in games with a permission structure the hierarchical ordering of the players is explicitly modeled by the digraph. In the literature there are models with an implicit ordering among the players, such as the Big Boss games (see Muto, Nakayama, Potters, & Tijs (1988)) or their generalization to Clan games (see Potters, Roos, Tijs, & Muto (1989)).5The conjunctive permission valueφis the solution that assigns to every game with a permission structure the Shapley value of the conjunctive restricted game, i.e.φ(N,vˆ,D)=φSh(N,rN,vˆ,Dc).A special class of games with a permission structure are those(N,vˆ,D)wherevˆis an additive game (i.e.vˆ(S)=∑i∈Svˆ({i})for allS⊆N), and(N,D)is a line graph meaning that there is a permutationπof the players such thatD={(π(i),π(i+1))|i∈{1,…,n-1}}. These games are also known as line-graph peer group games, see Brânzei, Fragnelli, and Tijs (2002).6For rooted trees, so also for line-graphs, the conjunctive approach coincides with the disjunctive approach to games with a permission structure where it is assumed that each player (except the top-players) needs permission from at least one of its predecessors, see Gilles and Owen (1999) and van den Brink (1997).6Although we agree with the critique of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) on the null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994), we further criticize their symmetry property. The definition of a symmetric player allows that two players i and j are symmetric, when for every ordered coalition not containing these two players, the marginal contribution of these players to any position in that order is the same, but for any ordered coalition containing these two players, exchanging their position yields a different worth. For example, considering the unanimity game of the order(1,2,3)onN={1,2,3}, according to the definition of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) all three players are symmetric, and therefore the symmetry axiom requires them to get the same payoff. Note that the null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) states that players 1 and 2 are null players and therefore earn zero, so all payoff goes to player 3.We consider both allocations to be extreme. We agree with Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) that players 1 and 2, although being null players in the sense that their marginal contribution as last player to any ordered coalition is zero, they are still needed to earn a positive worth. Player 3 on its own earns only zero.7Note the difference with null players in TU-games in characteristic function form where all marginal contributions of a player being zero indeed implies that without this player the other players earn the same whether this player cooperates with them or not.7However, we want to acknowledge the idea of Nowak and Radzik (1994) that player 3 should be rewarded for being the only player having a positive marginal contribution when entering, and therefore we propose a class of solutions which to this unanimity game assigns payoffs such that player 3 earns at least as much as player 2 who earns at least as much as player 1. We define this class of solutions using cooperative games with a permission structure, in particular with a line-graph structure.Given ordered coalitionT=(i1,…,it)∈Ω(N), define the directed line-graphDT={(ik,ik-1)|k∈{2,…,t}}with arcs going in the reverse direction of the order in the coalition. LetA={ak}k∈{1,…,n}withak∈Rkbe such that its lth component(ak)l⩾0for alll∈{1,…,k}and∑l=1k(ak)l=1. To any ordered unanimity gamewT∈GNwe assign a coalitional (characteristic function form) gamewˆTA∈GNgiven by(3.4)wˆTA=∑i∈H(T)(at)i(T)uˆ{i},whereuˆ{i}is the characteristic function of the (unordered) unanimity game on{i}. Then the corresponding solutionψAonGNis given by(3.5)ψA(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)Δv∗(T)t!φ(wˆTA,DT),withΔv∗(T)the dividends for generalized characteristic functions as defined in Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), see Section 2. So, this solution assigns to every ordered coalition the permission value of a corresponding game with permission structure where the permission structure is a directed line-graph in the reverse order of the coalition, and the game is a convex combination of the unanimity games of the singletons in the coalition, i.e. a convex combination of additive games. This solution also can be written asψiA(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)Δv∗(T)t!φi(wˆTA,DT)=∑T∈Ω(N)Δv∗(T)t!φi∑j∈H(T)(at)j(T)uˆ{j},DT=∑T∈Ω(N),i∈H(T)j∈H(T),j(T)⩽i(T)(at)j(T)(t-j(T)+1)t!Δv∗(T)foralli∈N.Some special cases are the following:1.If(ak)k=1and(ak)l=0for alll∈{1,…,k-1}, then we obtain the NR-valueψNR.If(ak)1=1and(ak)l=0for alll∈{2,…k}, then we obtain the SB-valueψSB.If(ak)l=1kfor alll∈{1,…,k}, then we obtain the linear solution determined byψ¯(wT)=1n!t∑j∈H(T)P(j,T)withP(j,T)i=0ifi(T)<j(T)ori∉H(T), andP(j,T)i=1t-j(T)+1ifi(T)⩾j(T).Consider the unanimity game(N,wT)∈GNwithN={1,2,3,4}andT=(1,2,3). ThenDT={(3,2),(2,1)}and for all A such thata3=((a3)1,(a3)2,(a3)3)we consider the coalitional (characteristic function form) gamevˆ=(a3)1uˆ{1}+(a3)2uˆ{2}+(a3)3uˆ{3}.1.Ifa3=(0,0,1)thenψA(N,wT)=16φ(uˆ{3},DT)=16φSh(N,uˆ{3})=16(0,0,1,0)=ψNR(N,wT).Ifa3=(1,0,0)thenψA(N,wT)=16φ(uˆ{1},DT)=16φSh(N,uˆ{1,2,3})=1613,13,13,0=ψSB(N,wT).Ifa3=13,13,13thenψA(N,wT)=16φ13(uˆ{1}+uˆ{2}+uˆ{3}),DT=16·3φSh(N,uˆ{1,2,3})+φSh(N,uˆ{2,3})+φSh(N,uˆ{3})=11813,13,13,0+0,12,12,0+(0,0,1,0)=11813,56,116,0=1108(2,5,11).Next we provide an axiomatic characterization of this class of solutions. Besides axioms that are already mentioned in Section 2, we use the following three. AlthoughψNRandψSBare very different, they have in common that in unanimity games, players at the end of the unanimity coalition earn at least as much as players in the beginning of the unanimity coalition. In some sense,ψSBis an extreme case where all players in the unanimity coalition get the same, whileψNRis the other extreme case where all payoff goes to the last player. Although we consider these two solutions as extreme, we require from a solution that it satisfies this monotonicity with respect to the order of the players in the unanimity coalition. So, we consider the ordering of the players in a unanimity game also as a priority ordering where the highest share in the worth should be given to the last player whose entrance is pivotal to generate the worth, and the share of players in the worth should be nonincreasing the more players have to enter after this player in order to generate the worth in the unanimity game. This will permit us to enlarge the set of solutions for generalized TU-games obtaining the class of order monotonic solutions.Axiom 3.2Order monotonicityIfT∈Ω(N)andi,j∈H(T)are such thati(T)<j(T)thenψi(N,wT)⩽ψj(N,wT).The next axiom is a standard anonymity, meaning that the labels of players do not matter for their payoffs. For(N,v)∈Gand permutationπ:N×N, we define(N,πv)∈Gbyπv(T)=v(πT)withπT=(π(i1),π(i2),…π(it))forT=(i1,i2,…it).Axiom 3.3AnonymityFor every permutationπ:N→Nit holds thatψi(N,v)=ψπ(i)(N,πv).Finally, we require that in monotone games all payoffs are nonnegative. A game(N,v)∈Gis monotone, ifv(R)⩽v(S)wheneverR⊆∼S.Axiom 3.4NonnegativityIf(N,v)∈Gis monotone, thenψi(N,v)⩾0for alli∈N.It turns out that these three axioms, together with expected efficiency, linearity and the null player property (of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997)) characterize the class of solutions defined above in (3.5). Therefore we refer to this class as the class of order monotonic solutions.Theorem 3.5A solutionψsatisfies expected efficiency, linearity, the null player property, order monotonicity, anonymity and nonnegativity if and only if there is anA={ak}k∈{1,…,n}, withak∈Rksatisfying(ak)l⩾0for alll∈{1,…,k}and∑l=1k(ak)l=1, such thatψ=ψA.It is straightforward to verify that all order monotonic solutions satisfy these properties. To show that only order monotonic solutions satisfy these properties, suppose that solutionψsatisfies expected efficiency, linearity, the null player property, order monotonicity, anonymity and nonnegativity. We first prove uniqueness for unanimity games(N,wT)by induction on t. Therefore, first considerwTwitht=1, i.e.H(T)={j}. Since alli∈N⧹{j}are null players inwT, the null player property implies thatψi(N,wT)=0for alli∈N⧹{j}. Expected efficiency then requires thatψj(N,wT)=1n!.Proceeding by induction, suppose that there exists anA={ak}k∈{1,…,n}, withak∈Rkfor allk∈{1,…,n}, satisfying(ak)l⩾0for alll∈{1,…,k}and∑l=1k(ak)l=1, such thatψ(N,wT′)=ψA(N,wT′)for allT′∈Ω(N)witht′<t, and considerT∈Ω(N)with|H(T)|=t. Since alli∈N⧹H(T)are null players in(N,wT), the null player property implies thatψi(N,wT)=0for alli∈N⧹H(T). Order monotonicity implies thatψi(N,wT)⩽ψj(N,wT)for alli,j∈H(T)withi(T)⩽j(T). So, by expected efficiency, nonnegativity and order monotonicity there exist numbersλt,k⩾0,k∈{1,…,t},λt,k⩾λt,k-1for allk∈{2,…,t}and∑k=1tλt,k=1such thatψi(N,wT)=λt,i(T)n!for alli∈H(T). Taking(at)1=λt,1and, recursively,(at)k=λt,k-∑l=1k-1(at)l, we obtain thatψ(N,wT)=ψA(N,wT).Moreover, anonymity implies thatψi(N,wT′)=ψiA(N,wT′)=λt,i(T′)n!for alli∈H(T′)whenevert′=tandA={ak}k∈{1,…,n}is as defined above.Solutionψbeing equal toψAon the class of all generalized characteristic functions then follows from linearity ofψand (2.2). □Note that anonymity implies thatψik(N,w{i1,…,it})=ψik′(N,w{i1′,…,it′})for allk∈{1,…,t}. The ratio(at)k(at)k+1can be different for different size t as long as order monotonicity is satisfied.We show logical independence of the axioms in Theorem 3.5 by the following alternative solutions (which cannot be obtained asψAwith A as in Theorem 3.5).1.The solution given byψi(N,v)=0for alli∈Nand(N,v)∈Gsatisfies linearity, the null player property, order monotonicity, anonymity and nonnegativity. It does not satisfy expected efficiency.The solution given byψ(N,v)=ψNR(N,v)if1n!∑T∈Π(N)v(T)⩽10, andψ(N,v)=ψSB(N,v)if1n!∑T∈Π(N)v(T)>10, satisfies expected efficiency, the null player property, order monotonicity, anonymity and nonnegativity. It does not satisfy linearity.The (equal division) solution given byψi(N,v)=1n!∑T∈Π(N)v(T)|N|for alli∈Nand(N,v)∈Gsatisfies expected efficiency, linearity, order monotonicity, anonymity and nonnegativity.

It does not satisfy order monotonicity.The solution given byψi(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)1∈H(T),1(T)≠tΔv∗(T)t!t+∑T∈Ω(N)1∈H(T),1(T)=tΔv∗(T)t!ifi=1,∑T∈Ω(N)i∈H(T),1(T)≠tΔv∗(T)t!tifi≠1,satisfies expected efficiency, linearity, the null player property, order monotonicity and nonnegativity. It does not satisfy anonymity.The solution given byψi(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)i(T)=t2Δv∗(T)t!-∑T∈Ω(N)i(T)=1Δv∗(T)t!,foralli∈Nand(N,v)∈G,satisfies expected efficiency, linearity, the null player property, order monotonicity and anonymity. It does not satisfy nonnegativity.Substituting in the previous theorem the order monotonicity axiom by the following axiom of rank monotonicity characterizes the so called arithmetic solution defined by:ψiart(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)i∈H(T)Δv∗(T)2i(T)(t+1)!t.Axiom 3.6Rank monotonicityFor everyN⊂N, there exist numberskt,t∈{1,…n}, such that for everyT∈Ω(N)andi∈H(T)holdsψi(N,wT)=kti(T).Solutionψsatisfies expected efficiency, linearity, the null player property, rank monotonicity, anonymity and nonnegativity if and only if it is the arithmetic solutionψart.The obvious proof is omitted.We argued before that we consider the symmetry axiom of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) to be too strong. A weaker symmetry requires equal payoffs for players that, besides being symmetric in the sense of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), also are such that for any ordered coalition containing both players, exchanging their position does not change the worth of the coalition. So, we call two playersi,j∈Nfully symmetric in v if they are symmetric in v and, moreover,v(T)=v(Tij)for allT∈Ω(N)withi,j∈H(T), whereTijis the ordered coalition (permutation of T) obtained by exchanging the positions of i and j, i.e.i(Tij)=j(T),j(Tij)=i(T)andh(Tij)=h(T)for allh∈H(T)⧹{i,j}.Axiom 3.8Full symmetryIf i and j are fully symmetric in(N,v)∈Gthenψi(N,v)=ψj(N,v).Since it requires equality of payoffs under stronger conditions on the players, full symmetry is weaker than symmetry of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997). All order monotonic solutions satisfy this weaker symmetry axiom which straightforward result we state without proof.Proposition 3.9Every order monotonic solution satisfies full symmetry.It is easy to verify that all geometric solutions given at the end of Section 2 are order monotonic sinceψi(T)α(N,wT)=αψi(T)+1α(N,wT)for alli∈H(T),T∈Ω(N),i(T)≠t. In this section we provide axiomatizations for these geometric solutions.In this section we generalize the axiomatization of the Shapley value for classical TU-games given in Manuel, González-Arangüena, and van den Brink (2013) to the context of generalized characteristic functions. We begin with defining what it means when players are indifferent to each other in a generalized characteristic function.Definition 4.1Given(N,v)∈G, playersi,j∈Nare related in(N,v)if and only ifi=jor there exists a family of ordered coalitions inΩ(N),{Tl}l=1m, verifying(i)Δv∗(Tl)≠0for alll=1,2,…,m.i∈H(T1),j∈H(Tm)andH(Tl)∩H(Tl+1)≠∅forl=1,2,…,m-1.Player i is indifferent to cooperate with player j in(N,v)∈Gif i and j are not related.Similar as for classical TU-games, this property is symmetrical and we can say that i and j are indifferent to mutual cooperation, or indifferent players for short. We say that an ordered coalition is essential if it has a nonzero dividend.First, we generalize null contributions for indifferent players to the class of generalized characteristic functions, stating that, if one player i is indifferent to cooperate with another player j, then he is even indifferent to the fact that this player leaves the game.Axiom 4.2A solutionψdefined onGsatisfies the null contributions for indifferent players property if, for all(N,v)∈Gand every pairi,jof indifferent players in generalized characteristic function v, it holds that:ψi(N,v)-ψi(N⧹{j},v|N⧹{j})=0.A solutionψonGsatisfies the balanced contributions property of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) if, for all(N,v)∈Gand alli,j∈N,ψi(N,v)-ψi(N⧹{j},v|N⧹{j})=ψj(N,v)-ψj(N⧹{i},v|N⧹{i}). This generalizes the balanced contributions property of Myerson (1980) for classical TU-games. The null contributions for indifferent players property establishes that, for indifferent players, the contributions must be balanced and, moreover, null. Therefore, in some sense it is more restrictive than balanced contributions of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) as it determines the value of the contributions. But in another sense it is less demanding because it only restricts the contributions for pairs of players that are indifferent. A similar remark was made in Manuel et al. (2013) on Myerson’s (1980) balanced contributions for classical TU-games.Similar as for classical TU-games, by repeated application of the null contributions for indifferent players property, this property can be straightforward extended to the case in which a given player is indifferent to all the players in a group and so the proof is omitted.Proposition 4.3Let(N,v)∈GandT∈Ω(N). Supposei∈N⧹H(T)is indifferent to each player inH(T). Ifψis a solution defined onGsatisfying the null contributions for indifferent players property, thenψi(N,v)=ψi(N⧹H(T),v|N⧹H(T)).Next we generalize the enemy players property used in Manuel et al. (2013) to characterize the Shapley value for classical TU-games to the context of generalized characteristic functions.8The enemy players property for TU-game solutions states that the payoff of two players who become enemies change by the same amount, where two players becoming enemies means that all dividends of coalitions that contain both players become zero. Formally, an allocation ruleψon G satisfies the enemy players property if, for all(N,v)∈Gand all pair of playersi,j∈N, it holds thatψi(v)-ψi(vij)=ψj(v)-ψj(vij), where for TU-game v andi,j∈N, the gamevijis given byvij=∑{i,j}⊈S⊆NΔv(S)uS.8When, in a TU-game two players decide not to cooperate (for instance, because they become enemies), then all coalitions that contain both players loose their dividend. However, in a generalized characteristic function we should take account of the order and position of the players when they become enemies. We distinguish three cases and explore their effects. First, when two players i and j become enemies we assume that the dividendsΔv∗(T)are lost for all ordered coalitions to which i and j both belong and enter consecutive and always in the same order (say i before j). We denote byE0(i,j)={T∈Ω(N)|{i,j}⊆H(T)withj(T)=i(T)+1}the collection of all ordered coalitions to which i and j both belong and enter consecutive with i entering first.Definition 4.4Given(N,v)∈Gandi,j∈Nwe define the game(N,v0ij)∈Gas:v0ij=∑T∈Ω(N)⧹E0(i,j)Δv∗(T)wT.Letα∈[0,1]. A solutionψonGsatisfies theα-enemy players property if, for all(N,v)∈Gand every pair of playersi,j∈Nwhich are not indifferent in v, it holds:ψi(N,v)-ψi(N,v0ij)=α(ψj(N,v)-ψj(N,v0ij)).The parameterαcan be seen as some kind of commitment parameter with respect to an agreement about cooperation. In a ‘classical’ TU-game a coalition forms at once and when it is formed the agreement is binding. But in cooperative games in generalized characteristic function, even when a set of players agrees to cooperate, the players enter sequentially and it can be that when a player enters it can still deviate and not cooperate (or become enemies) with certain players. This means that when playerik,k∈{1,…,t-1}in ordered coalitionT=(i1,…,it)enters, it does not yet know if the dividend of coalition T will be realized since it depends on the players that still must enter. For example, consider playerit-1. Ifα∈(0,1]is the probability that playeritstill becomes enemy with him/her, then the contribution of playeritis not only its participation in the generation of worth, but also its decision to stick to the agreement. This is reflected by the change in payoff of playeritwhen participating instead of acting as enemy, being a fraction1αhigher then the change in payoff of playerit-1. Assuming that the probability of becoming enemy with your predecessor in ordered coalition T at any position is the same, the same reasoning can be held for any two players in consecutive positions, leading to theα-enemy players property. Without going into a full strategic analysis, depending on the degree of commitment, the parameterαdetermines the incentive for later players to commit to the agreement. Ifα=1then the agreement is a commitment, and the position where a player enters the coalition does not matter, leading to an equal effect on the payoffs of two players when the successor becomes enemy with the predecessor. Whenα=0then there is no commitment at all and the payoff of a player does not depend on the contribution of players entering after him.Forα∈(0,1], theα-enemy players property together with expected efficiency and null contributions for indifferent players characterize the corresponding geometric solution.Theorem 4.6Letα∈(0,1]. A solutionψdefined onGsatisfies expected efficiency, theα-enemy players property and null contributions for indifferent players if and only if it is the geometric solutionψα.It is straightforward to verify thatψα,α∈(0,1], satisfies expected efficiency, theα-enemy players property and null contributions for indifferent players.To prove uniqueness, takeα∈(0,1]and consider a solutionψdefined onGand satisfying expected efficiency, theα-enemy players property and the null contributions for indifferent players property. We prove uniqueness by induction on the number of essential coalitions. Letd(N,v)=|δ(N,v)|, whereδ(N,v)={T∈Ω(N)|Δv∗(T)≠0}.Ifd(N,v)=0, then(N,v)is the null game (i.e.v(T)=0for allT∈Ω(N)), and thus everyi∈Nis indifferent to each player inN⧹{i}. Therefore, by Proposition 4.3,ψi(N,v)=ψi({i},v|{i})for alli∈N. Asv|{i}({i})=0, by expected efficiency we haveψi(N,v)=ψi({i},v|{i})=0, and thusψcoincides withψα.Suppose now, by the induction hypothesis, thatψ(N,v)is uniquely determined for all games(N,v′)∈Gwithd(N,v′)=k, and consider a game(N,v)∈Gwithd(N,v)=k+1. Leti∈Nand letC(i)be the set of players to whom i is not indifferent. IfC(i)={i}, then similar as in the cased(N,v)=0above, player i is indifferent to each player inN⧹{i}, and using the same reasoning as before, we have thatψi(N,v)is uniquely determined.Alternatively, suppose thati∈Nis such that|C(i)|>1, and letj∈C(i),j≠i. By the definition of indifferent players, there exists a sequence of players(i1,i2,…,ir)withi1=i,ir=j,il∈C(i)forl=1,2,…,rand such that, for eachl=1,2,…,r-1, there is aTl∈δ(N,v)with{il,il+1}⊆H(Tl). Suppose thatTl=(h1,…,hk). Asψsatisfies theα-enemy players property, for everyp∈{1,…,k-1}we haveψhp(N,v)-ψhp(N,v0hphp+1)=α(ψhp+1(N,v)-ψhp+1(N,v0hphp+1)),and thus:ψhp(N,v)-αψhp+1(N,v)=ψhp(N,v0hphp+1)-αψhp+1(N,v0hphp+1).Asd(N,v0hphp+1)<d(N,v)=k+1, using the induction hypothesisψhp(N,v0hphp+1)andψhp+1(N,v0hphp+1)are determined and thus there exist known numberschphp+1=ψhp(N,v0hphp+1)-αψhp+1(N,v0hphp+1)such thatψhp(N,v)-αψhp+1(N,v)=chphp+1.Assuming, without loss of generality thatil=hqandil+1=hs,q<s, this yields that there exists a known numberc‾il,il+1such thatψil(N,v)-αs-qψil+1(N,v)=c‾il,il+1.Since this holds for allTlin the sequence above, using this previous reasoning iteratively, there exist known numbersc̃ij>0andcˆijsuch that9Note thatc̃ij=αzfor somez∈N.9(4.6)ψi(N,v)-c̃ijψj(N,v)=cˆijforj∈C(i).By the null contributions for indifferent players property:ψj(N,v)=ψj(C(i),v|C(i))for allj∈C(i),and thus:(4.7)∑j∈C(i)ψj(N,v)=∑j∈C(i)ψj(C(i),v|C(i)),where the right hand side is determined by expected efficiency. Therefore, we have|C(i)|linear independent equations given by the(|C(i)|-1)Eqs. (4.6) and Eq. (4.7) in the|C(i)|unknown payoffsψj(N,v),j∈C(i), which thus are uniquely determined. □Although the NR-value satisfies expected efficiency, the 0-enemy players property and null contributions for indifferent players, it is not characterized by these properties. However, substituting null contributions for indifferent players by null contributions for weakly indifferent players, characterizes all geometric solutionsψα,α∈[0,1], with the correspondingα-enemy players property.Definition 4.7Given(N,v)∈G,i,j∈Nare weakly indifferent in(N,v)if and only if there is no ordered coalition T withΔv∗(T)≠0and{i,j}⊆H(T).As this property is obviously symmetrical, whenever it holds, we say that i and j are weakly indifferent to mutual cooperation, or weakly indifferent players for short.We can make clear the distinction between players that are weakly indifferent and indifferent by using (undirected) graphs. An (undirected) graph on player set N is a setL⊆{{i,j}|i,j∈N,i≠j}of coalitions of size two. These elements are called edges or links. For game(N,v)∈Gwe can construct the graphLv={{i,j}|there is an ordered coalitionT∈Ω(N)such thatΔv∗(T)≠0and{i,j}⊆H(T)}where two players are linked to each other if and only if they belong together to at least one ordered coalition that has a nonzero dividend. Then two players are weakly indifferent if they are not linked, while they are indifferent if they belong to different components or maximally connected coalitions, i.e. if there is no path connecting them.Axiom 4.8A solutionψdefined onGsatisfies the null contributions for weakly indifferent players property if, for all(N,v)∈Gand all pairsi,jof weakly indifferent players in(N,v), it holds that:ψi(N,v)-ψi(N⧹{j},v|N⧹{j})=0.Since two players that are indifferent (see Definition 4.1) are obviously weakly indifferent (see Definition 4.7), null contributions for weakly indifferent players implies null contributions for indifferent players.Theorem 4.9Letα∈[0,1]. A solutionψdefined onGsatisfies expected efficiency, theα-enemy players property and null contributions for weakly indifferent players if and only if it is the geometric solutionψα.The result forα∈(0,1]follows from Theorem 4.6 since null contributions for weakly indifferent players implies null contributions for indifferent players. On the other hand it is obvious thatψ0=ψNRsatisfies expected efficiency, 0-enemy players property and null contributions for weakly indifferent players. So, we are left to show uniqueness for the caseα=0. Consider a solutionψdefined onGand satisfying expected efficiency, the 0-enemy players and the null contributions for weakly indifferent players properties and let us prove that it coincides withψ0.We again prove this by induction on the number of essential coalitions. The proof for the casesd(N,v)=0andd(N,v)>0,|C(i)|=1, is the same as in the proof of uniqueness in Theorem 4.6. So, we continue with the cased(N,v)=k+1>0and|C(i)|>1, assuming by induction that uniqueness holds for all games(N,v′)withd(N,v′)=kand for game(N,v)for all components with|C(i)|=1. We will distinguish two cases.First, if there is aT∈δ(N,v)withi∈Tandi(T)≠t(so i is not the last player in T) then the 0-enemy players property implies that:ψi(N,v)-ψi(N,v0ij)=0,wherej(T)=i(T)+1. Sinced(N,v0ij)<k=d(N,v),ψi(N,v)=ψi(N,v0ij)is determined by the induction hypothesis.Second, suppose thatT∈δ(N,v)andi∈Timply thati(T)=t, i.e. in every essential coalition player i belongs to it has the last position. Suppose there are two playersi,j∈N,i≠j, that satisfy this condition. Then there is noT∈δ(N,v)such that{i,j}⊆H(T)since they cannot both have the last position in T. DefiningWi(N,v)={j∈N|{i,j}⊆H(T)for at least oneT∈δ(N,v)}, it holds thatψi(N,v)=ψi(Wi(N,v),v|Wi(N,v))by null contributions for weakly indifferent players. But since player i is the only player in(Wi(N,v),v|Wi(N,v))for whom the payoff in(Wi(N,v),v|Wi(N,v))is not determined by the first or second case, the payoff of i in(Wi(N,v),v|Wi(N,v))is uniquely determined by expected efficiency. □Since the NR-value and the SB-value are geometric solutions, we obtain axiomatizations of these solutions as a corollary.Corollary 4.10(i)A solutionψdefined onGsatisfies expected efficiency, the 0-enemy players property and null contributions for weakly indifferent players if and only if it is the NR-valueψNR.A solutionψsatisfies expected efficiency, the 1-enemy players property and null contributions for weakly indifferent players if and only if it is the SB-valueψSB.Note that forα=0, the 0-enemy players property is some kind of independence axiom stating that the payoff for the ‘lower ordered’ player does not change when two players become enemies. This is also the reason why in the proof of Theorem 4.9 we have to treat uniqueness for the caseα=0separate.We show logical independence of the axioms in Theorem 4.9 by the following alternative solutions (which are not geometric solutions).1.The solution given byψi(N,v)=0for alli∈Nand(N,v)∈Gsatisfies theα-enemy players property for everyα∈[0,1], and null contributions for weakly indifferent players. It does not satisfy expected efficiency.The solution given byψi(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)i(T)=1Δv∗(T)t!,foralli∈Nand(N,v)∈G,satisfies expected efficiency and null contributions for weakly indifferent players. It does not satisfy theα-enemy players property for anyα∈[0,1].The solution given byψi(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)i∉H(T)Δv∗(T)t!(n-t),foralli∈Nand(N,v)∈G,satisfies expected efficiency and theα-enemy players property for everyα∈[0,1]. It does not satisfy null contributions for weakly indifferent players.Note that the first two examples are the Examples 1 and 4 that were used to show logical independence of the axioms in Theorem 3.5 in Section 3.Above, in theα-enemy players property, we assumed that when two players become enemies, then only coalitions where they enter consecutive and always in the same order, loose their dividends. Second, we now investigate what happens if we strengthen this axiom by considering that if two players become enemies, then all coalitions that contain both players and they always enter in the same order (but not necessarily consecutive), loose their dividend. We denote byE‾(i,j)={T∈Ω(N)|{i,j}⊆H(T)withj(T)>i(T)}⊃E0(i,j)the collection of all ordered coalitions to which i and j both belong with i entering before j.Definition 4.11Given(N,v)∈Gandi,j∈Nwe define the game(N,v‾ij)∈Gas:v‾ij=∑T∈Ω(N)⧹E‾(i,j)Δv∗(T)wT.Letα∈[0,1]. A solutionψonGsatisfies the strongα-enemy players property if, for all(N,v)∈Gand every pair of playersi,j∈Nwhich are not indifferent in v, it holds:ψi(N,v)-ψi(N,v‾ij)=α(ψj(N,v)-ψj(N,v‾ij)).For someα∈[0,1], there is a solutionψdefined onGsatisfying expected efficiency, the strongα-enemy players property and null contributions for weakly indifferent players if and only ifα∈{0,1}. Moreover, ifα=0then this solution is the NR-value, while ifα=1it is the SB-value.One step further, in a third generalization of the enemy players property, besides assuming that two players becoming enemies also affects coalitions where they do not enter consecutive, we can strengthen this property further by letting all coalitions containing these two players loose their dividend, irrespective in which order these two players enter. We denote byE(i,j)={T∈Ω(N)|{i,j}⊆H(T)}=E‾(i,j)∪E‾(j,i)⊃E0(i,j)the collection of all ordered coalitions containing i and j.Definition 4.14Given(N,v)∈Gandi,j∈Nwe define the game(N,vij)∈Gas:vij=∑T∈Ω(N)⧹E(i,j)Δv∗(T)wT.Letα∈[0,1]. A solutionψonGsatisfies the no-orderα-enemy players property if, for all(N,v)∈Gand every pair of playersi,j∈Nwhich are not indifferent in v, it holds:ψi(N,v)-ψi(N,vij)=α(ψj(N,v)-ψj(N,vij)).For someα∈[0,1], there is a solutionψdefined onGsatisfying expected efficiency, the no-orderα-enemy players property and null contributions for weakly indifferent players if and only ifα=1. Moreover, ifα=1then this solution is the SB-value.In the last corollary we could use null contributions for indifferent players instead of null contributions for weakly indifferent players.Above, we strengthened theα-enemy players property by (i) also considering effects of two players becoming enemies when they do not enter consecutive (strongα-enemy players property), and (ii) also ignore the order between them (no-orderα-enemy players property). We end this section by formulating an axiom where we take account of all orders in which two players who become enemies appear. To do this consider first the following definition.LetEr(i,j)={T∈Ω(N)|i,j∈H(T)withj(T)=i(T)+r+1}forr=0,1,…n-2. Note thatE0(i,j)was previously defined.Definition 4.17Given(N,v)∈Gandi,j∈N, for eachr=0,…,n-2, we define the game(N,vrij)∈Gas:vrij=∑T∈Er(i,j)Δv∗(T)wT.Letα∈[0,1]. A solutionψonGsatisfies the globalα-enemy players property if, for all(N,v)∈Gand every pair of playersi,j∈Nwhich are not indifferent in v, it holds:ψi(N,v)-ψi(N,vij)=ψj(N,v)-ψj(N,vij)+∑r=0n-2(1-αr+1)(ψi(N,vrji)-ψj(N,vrij)).In order to illustrate the property, consider the players of a team in a soccer match and suppose the generalized game assigns to every ordered coalition the probability of that team obtaining a goal in a particular play if players pass the ball in the order given by such a (ordered) coalition. Teams with an elaborated style usually play with many passes between players. On the other hand the direct style yields a goal using the minimum possible number of passes. Under the assumptions of the global enemy players property, the contributions of players in long plays are preferred to those one in short plays (an elaborated game is preferred instead of a direct game). If two players become enemies and so they cannot stay together in the ground, the one suffering a greater loss is the one that usually participates later in the plays. So, if a defender and a forward become enemies the loss is greater for the forward. If two middles become enemies the loss of both must be more or less the same.We can show that in Theorems 4.6 and 4.9 theα-enemy players property can be replaced by the globalα-enemy players property.10The proofs are a modification of the proofs of Theorems 4.6 and 4.9 and can be obtained from the authors on request.10Proposition 4.19(i)Letα∈(0,1]. A solutionψdefined onGsatisfies expected efficiency, the globalα-enemy players property and null contributions for indifferent players if and only if it is the geometric solutionψα.Letα∈[0,1]. A solutionψdefined onGsatisfies expected efficiency, the globalα-enemy players property and null contributions for weakly indifferent players if and only if it is the geometric solutionψα.In this paper we argued that, besides the null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994), also the symmetry property of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) for generalized characteristic functions reflects an extreme way to deal with the importance of the order on the payoff allocation. Whereas the NR-null player property requires zero payoff also for players for whom the worth of an ordered coalition (in which they are not the last player) changes when this player would not participate, the symmetry property requires equal payoffs also for players for whom there is an ordered coalition containing these two players, where exchanging their position yields a different worth. To respect the order as in Nowak and Radzik (1994), but not as extreme as they do, we introduced the axiom of order monotonicity with respect to the order of the players in a unanimity coalition, requiring that players who enter earlier should get not more in the corresponding unanimity game than players who enter later. This is weaker than symmetry since in a unanimity game all players in the unanimity coalition are symmetric and therefore earn the same payoff if symmetry is satisfied. We showed that, together with expected efficiency, linearity, the null player property (of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997)), anonymity and nonnegativity, this order monotonicity characterizes a class of solutions, called the class of order monotonic solutions, which contains the NR-value and SB-value as extreme cases. Within this class we specifically characterized the so-called geometric solutions.Besides the class of geometric solutions, we mention a second class that follows naturally from our critique on the NR-null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) and the symmetry property of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997). As explained in Section 3, a major difference between the axioms underlying the NR- and SB-values is what they consider null players and symmetric players, and consequently how they treat these players in the payoff allocation. The null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) implies that in the unanimity game on an ordered coalitionT=(i1,…,it), all players except playeritare null players. The null player property of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) is much weaker and also takes account of the role that players have in making players that enter after them productive, and thus none of the players inH(T)is a null player in(N,wT).On the other hand, the symmetry axiom of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) does not take account of possible asymmetries between players when they switch position in ordered coalitions they both belong to. Consequently, in the unanimity game on an ordered coalitionT=(i1,…,it), all players inH(T)={i1,…,it}are symmetric and earn the same payoff.The null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) is so extreme that they even do not need a symmetry axiom for their axiomatization. The null player property of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) is weak, but they need the strong symmetry axiom. Our next goal is to find a compromise by allowing a null player property that is weaker than that of Nowak and Radzik (1994) and a symmetry that is weaker than that of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), but which are still compatible.***11Note that, under expected efficiency, the symmetry axiom of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) is incompatible with the null player property of Nowak and Radzik (1994) since according to the last axiom, in the unanimity game on ordered coalition T all players except the last in order T should get zero payoff, implying that the last player in T should get all the payoff that is distributed according to expected efficiency, while according to the symmetry axiom of Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997) all players inH(T)should get the same payoff.11In order to do this, letp∈[0,1]. Playeri∈Nis a p-null player in(N,v)∈Gif for every ordered coalitionT=(i1,…it)∈Ω(N⧹{i}), it holds thatv(T,il)=v(T)for alll∈{⌈p(t+1)⌉,…,t+1}, where⌈z⌉=min{x∈N|z⩽x}is the upper integer part of z.12We considerNas the set of positive integers, so excluding 0.12Axiom 5.1p-null player propertyLetp∈[0,1]. Ifi∈Nis a p-null player in(N,v)∈Gthenψi(N,v)=0.Forp∈[0,1], playersi,j∈Nare p-symmetric in(N,v)∈Gif for every ordered coalitionT∈Ω(N⧹{i,j}), it holds thatv(T,il)=v(T,jl)for alll∈{⌈p(t+1)⌉,…,t+1}.Axiom 5.2p-symmetryLetp∈[0,1]. Ifi,j∈Nare p-symmetric in(N,v)∈Gthenψi(N,v)=ψj(N,v).Forp=1andp=0, the p-null player property and p-symmetry are the null and the symmetry properties of Nowak and Radzik (1994) and Sánchez and Bergantiños (1997), respectively.Theorem 5.3Letp∈[0,1]. A solutionψsatisfies expected efficiency, linearity, the p-null player property and p-symmetry if and only if it isψAgiven by(3.5) and (3.4)with(ak)l=1ifl=⌈pk⌉and(ak)l=0otherwise.13It is straightforward to verify that the solutions given in the theorem satisfy expected efficiency, linearity and the corresponding p-null player and p-symmetry axioms. To show uniqueness, consider the generalized unanimity game(N,wT)withT=(i1,…,it), andp∈[0,1]. By the p-null player property,ψi(N,wT)=0for alli∈N⧹{i⌈pt⌉,…,it}. By p-symmetry all players in{i⌈pt⌉,…,it}earn the same payoff, and thus the payoffs are determined by expected efficiency. Uniqueness on the class of all generalized characteristic functions then follows from linearity ofψ.13As a final remark, we mention that instead of order monotonicity, we could define the reverse stating that in unanimity games, players at the beginning of the unanimity coalition earn at least as much as players at the end of the unanimity coalition.Axiom 5.4Reverse order monotonicityIfT∈Ω(N)andi,j∈H(T)are such thati(T)<j(T)thenψi(N,wT)⩾ψj(N,wT).Similar as done in Section 3, we can characterize a class of solutions given by (3.5) but replacing digraphDTby digraphDT-={(i,j)|(j,i)∈DT}={(ik,ik+1)|k∈{1,…,t-1}}forT=(i1,…it)∈Ω(N), yieldingψiA,-(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)Δv∗(T)t!φi(wˆTA,DT-)=∑T∈Ω(N),i∈H(T)j∈H(T),j(T)⩾i(T)(at)j(T)j(T)t!Δv∗(T)foralli∈N.Similar as Theorem 3.5, it can be proved that a solutionψsatisfies expected efficiency, linearity, the null player property, reverse order monotonicity, anonymity and nonnegativity if and only if there is anA={ak}k∈{1,…,n}, withak∈Rksatisfying(ak)l⩾0for alll∈{1,…,k}and∑l=1k(ak)l=1, such thatψ=ψA,-.Obviously, the SB-valueψSBis the only solution that belongs to this class of reverse order monotonic solutions as well as to the class of order monotonic solutions characterized in Theorem 3.5. The NR-valueψNRis not reverse monotonic, but has its reverse order monotonic counterpartψNR,-in this class given byψiNR,-(N,v)=∑T∈Ω(N)i(T)=1Δv∗(T)t!,foralli∈N.(Note that we already used this solution as the fourth alternative to show logical independence of the axioms of Theorem 3.5.)Which monotonicity to use depends on the application one has in mind. In many situations it is the pivotal player, the last one to enter to generate worth, who is most powerfull. This is the idea underlying the solution of Nowak and Radzik (1994) and is, for example, also the case in strategic games as matching pennies in which there is a first-mover disadvantage. On the other hand, considering a bargaining situation it can be beneficial to have the initiative and be the first proposer. This is the case in the bargaining model of Rubinstein (1982) where there is a first-mover advantage. Similar, in applications of generalized characteristic functions it can sometimes be beneficial (with respect to the share one gets from the worth) to be the last player to enter, and sometimes to be the first.
