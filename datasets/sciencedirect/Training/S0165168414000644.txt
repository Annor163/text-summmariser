@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we design and analyze a Newton-like blind equalization algorithm for the APSK system. Specifically, we exploit the principle of minimum entropy deconvolution and derive a blind equalization cost function for APSK signals and optimize it using Newton׳s method. We study and evaluate the steady-state excess mean square error performance of the proposed algorithm using the concept of energy conservation. Numerical results depict a significant performance enhancement for the proposed scheme over well established blind equalization algorithms. Further, the analytical excess mean square error of the proposed algorithm is verified with computer simulations and is found to be in good conformation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In digital communications at high enough data rates, almost all physical channels exhibit inter-symbol interference (ISI). One of the solutions to this problem is blind equalization, which is a method to equalize distortive communication channels and mitigate ISI without supervision. Blind equalization algorithms do not require training at either the startup period or restart after system breakdown. This independence of blind schemes with respect to training sequence results in improved system bandwidth efficiency.In blind equalization, the desired signal is unknown to the receiver, except for its probabilistic or statistical properties over some known alphabets. As both the channel and its input are unknown, the objective of blind equalization is to recover the unknown input sequence based solely on its probabilistic and statistical properties [1–3]. From the available literature, it can be found that any admissible blind objective (or cost) function has two main attributes: (1) it makes use of the statistics which are significantly modified as the signal propagates through the channel [4] and (2) optimization of the cost function modifies the statistics of the signal at the equalizer output, aligning them with the statistics of the signal at the channel input [5].One of the earliest methods of blind equalization was suggested by Benveniste et al. [5]. Their proposed method assumed the transmitted signal to be non-Gaussian, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sequence of a known statistical distribution. It sought to match the distribution of its output (deconvolved sequence) with the distribution of the transmitted signal and the adaptation continued until the said objective was achieved. Another approach to this problem was devised by Donoho [4], who defined a partial ordering, measuring the relative Gaussianity between random variables. He suggested to adjust the equalizer until the distribution of the deconvolved sequence is as non-Gaussian as possible. A somewhat informal version of Donoho׳s method appeared in the work of Wiggins [6,7]. According to Wiggins, assuming the transmitted signal is a non-Gaussian signal with certain distribution pa, the equalizer must be adjusted to make its output signal distribution resemble pa. He termed this approach as a minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) criterion.In this work, the MED criterion is the subject of our concern for designing (and optimizing) cost functions to equalize signals blindly in amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) systems. The APSK signals are very important in modern day communication systems due to their robustness against nonlinear channel distortion and advantageous lower peak-to-average power ratio compared to the conventional quadrature amplitude modulation signals (refer to APSK based systems in [8–14] and references therein).This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the baseband communication system model, notion of Gaussianity, and traditional blind equalizers. Section 3 describes the MED criteria for channel equalization, discusses the admissibility of costs tailored for APSK, and stochastic gradient-based optimization. Section 4 formulates the proposed adaptive MED-based blind equalization scheme for APSK systems exploiting Newton-like update. Section 5 provides a steady-state tracking performance of the proposed algorithm in time varying scenario. Simulation results are discussed in Section 6 and conclusions are provided in Section 7.The baseband model for a typical complex-valued data communication system, as shown in Fig. 1, consists of an unknown finite-impulse response filterhn, which represents the physical inter-connection between the transmitter and the receiver. A zero-mean, i.i.d., circularly symmetric, complex-valued data sequence{an}is transmitted through the channel, whose output xnis recorded by the receiver. The input/output relationship of the channel can be written asxn=∑kan−khk+νn,where the additive noise νnis assumed to be stationary, Gaussian, and independent of the channel input an. The function of equalizer at the receiver is to estimate the delayed version of original data,an−τ, from the received signal xn. Letwn=[wn,0,wn,1,…,wn,N−1]Tbe a vector of equalizer coefficients with N elements andxn=[xn,xn−1,…,xn−N+1]Tbe the vector of channel observations (T denotes transpose operation). The output of the equalizer is then given byyn=wn−1Hxn(H denotes the Hermitian conjugate operator). Iftn=hn⊗wn−1⁎represents the overall channel-equalizer impulse response (⊗denotes convolution), then(1)yn=∑iwn−1,i⁎xn−i=tn,τan−τ+∑l≠τtn,lan−l+ν'n︸signal+ISI+noisewhich demonstrates the adverse effect of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and additive noise. The ISI is quantified as [15]:(2)ISI=∑i|tn,i|2−max{|tn|2}max{|tn|2}In subsequent discussions we drop the subscript n from t for notational convenience. The idea behind a Bussgang blind equalizer is to minimize (or maximize), through the choice ofw, a certain cost function J depending on yn, such that ynprovides an estimate of anup to some inherent indeterminacies, giving,yn=αan−τ, whereα=|α|ejθ∈Crepresents an arbitrary complex-valued gain. Hence, a Bussgang blind equalizer tries to solve the following optimization problem:(3)w†=argwoptimizeJwithJ=EJ(yn)The cost J is a function of implicitly embedded statistics of ynandJ(·)is a real-valued function. Ideally, the cost J makes use of statistics which are significantly modified as the signal propagates through the channel, and the optimization of cost modifies the statistics of the signal at the equalizer output, aligning them with those at a channel input. The equalization is accomplished when equalized sequence ynacquires an identical distribution as that of the channel input an. More formally, we have the following theorem [5]:Theorem 1If the transmitted signal is composed of non-Gaussian i.i.d. samples, both the channel and the equalizer are linear time-invariant filters, noise is negligible, and the probability density functions (PDF) of transmitted and equalized signals are equal, then the channel has been perfectly equalized.This mathematical result is very important since it establishes the possibility of obtaining an equalizer with the sole aid of signal׳s statistical properties and without requiring any knowledge of the channel impulse response or training data sequence. Meanwhile, Donoho [4] noted that, as a consequence of the central limit theorem, linear combinations of identically distributed random variables become more Gaussian than the individual variables. Therefore, the received signal xnwill have a distribution that is more nearly Gaussian than the distribution of an. Any suitable objective function capable of measuring Gaussianity or non-Gaussianity can therefore be used for deconvolution.One of the measures of Gaussianity is (normalized) kurtosis, κ, which is a statistic based on second and fourth-order moments. For a circularly-symmetric complex-valued random variable X, kurtosis is defined as [15]:(4)κX=E|x|4(E|x|2)2−2κXis greater than zero, equal to zero, and less than zero for super-Gaussian, Gaussian, and sub-Gaussian random variables, respectively. Expectedly most of the existing blind equalizers use second and fourth-order statistics of the equalized sequence. The first ever method which relies on the aforesaid statistics is the constant modulus criterion [16]; it is given by(5)minw{E|yn|4−2R2E|yn|2},where R is the Godard radius andR2=E|an|4/E|an|2is the Godard dispersion constant[17]. For an input signal that has a constant modulus|an|=R, the constant modulus criterion penalizes output samples ynthat do not have the desired constant modulus characteristics [18].Shalvi and Weinstein [15] demonstrated that the condition of equality between the PDF of the transmitted and equalized signals, due to Theorem 1, was excessively tight. Under the similar assumptions, as laid in Theorem 1, they discussed the possibility to perform blind equalization by satisfying the conditionE|yn|2=E|an|2and ensuring that a nonzero cumulant (of any order higher than 2) of anand ynare equal. For a two dimensional signal anwith four-quadrant symmetry (i.e.,Ean2=0), they suggested to maximize the following exemplary cost containing second and fourth-order statistics:(6)maxw|E|yn|4−2(E|yn|2)2|s.t.E|yn|2=E|an|2In the next section, we discuss equalization/deconvolution techniques which evolved around the notion of entropy as a measure of Gaussianity.In statistics, the most powerful test of the null hypothesis against another is one which maximizes discrimination and minimizes the probability of accepting the null hypothesis as true when actually the alternative is true. In information theory, a statistic that maximizes detectability of a signal while minimizing the probability of a false alarm is most powerful. In seismic community, however, a statistical (rank-discriminating) test against Gaussianity, which can be used to design a deconvolution filter, is loosely termed as a MED criterion [4,6].Hogg [19] developed a scale-invariant and the most powerful rank-discriminating test for one member of the generalized Gaussian against another by considering the following PDF:(7)pY(y,α)=α2Γ(1α)exp(−|y|α),|y|<∞whereα>0is shape parameter, andΓ(·)is the Gamma function. To determine if a random set of samples{y1,y2,…,yB}is drawn from the distributionpY(y,α2)as opposed topY(y,α1), a ratio test was derived (based on the procedure described in [20]) as follows:(8)VY(α1,α2)=(1B∑i=1B|yi|α1)B/α1(1B∑i=1B|yi|α2)B/α2≷α=α1α=α2χwhere χ is some threshold. The larger V becomes, the more probable it is that the sample set Y is drawn from the distributionpY(y,α2)and notpY(y,α1).It would be interesting to look at the entropy,H(α), associated with (7); it is given as follows [21]:(9)H(α)=log(2αΓ(1α)3/Γ(3α)2)+1αThis function is illustrated in Fig. 2for different members of the family. The entropy is maximum for Gaussian (whenα=2). Note that(α<2)and(α>2)represent super-Gaussian and sub-Gaussian cases, respectively. Asα→0,H(α)rapidly goes to−∞which is the entropy of the certain event; however, on the other side,H(α)falls off slowly to another minimum, which is the entropy of the uniform distribution.From the work of Geary [22], it became known to the statistical community that the test against Gaussianity1B∑i=1B|xi|4/(1B∑i=1B|xi|2)2is most efficient when no information on the distribution of the random sample is available. Remarkably, Wiggins exploited the same idea and sought to determine the inverse channelw†that maximizes the kurtosis of the deconvolved seismic data yn[6]. Since seismic data are super-Gaussian in nature, given B samples of yn, Wiggins suggested to maximize the following test (or cost):(10)JW(yn)=1B∑n=1B|yn|4(1B∑n=1B|yn|2)2⟶largeBE|yn|4(E|yn|2)2This scheme seeks the smallest number of large spikes (or impulses) consistent with the data, thus maximizing the order, or equivalently, minimizing the entropy or disorder in the data [23]. Wiggins coined the term MED criterion for the test (10).11The simple structure of the impulsive function led Wiggins to call his technique MED. According to [24], however, the approach which Wiggins actually adopts is not entropy; it is rather a variant of varimax rotation which is widely used in obtaining a simple factor structure in factor analysis.Immediately after Wiggins, Ooe and Ulrych [24] realized that better deconvolution results may be obtained for super-Gaussian signals if non-Gaussianity is maximized with some α less than two; they used(α=1)and suggested(11)JOU(yn)=1B∑n=1B|yn|2(1B∑n=1B|yn|)2⟶largeBE|yn|2(E|yn|)2Later, Gray presented a generic MED criterion with two degrees of freedom [25]:(12)JG(yn)=1B∑n=1B|yn|p(1B∑n=1B|yn|q)p/q⟶largeBE|yn|p(E|yn|q)p/qNote that costs (10)–(12) are members of (8) for different values of shape parameters. In the context of digital communication, where the underlying distribution of the transmitted (possibly pulse amplitude modulated) data symbols is closer to a uniform density (sub-Gaussian), we can obtain a blind equalizer by optimizing Gray׳s cost (12) as follows [26,27]:(13)w†=maxwJG(yn),forp=2andq>2.Recently, Abrar and Nandi [28] discussed the case(p,q)=(2,∞)for the blind equalization of the APSK signal:(14)JAN(yn)=1B∑n=1B|yn|2(max{|yn|})2⟶largeBE|yn|2(max{|yn|})2Maximizing (14) can be interpreted as determining the equalizer coefficients,w, which drives the distribution of its output, yn, away from Gaussian distribution toward uniform, thus removing successfully the interference from the received signal. Note that the cost (14) is an optimal, scale-invariant test for the APSK signal against Gaussianity (refer to Appendix A for details).In this section, we discuss the admissibility ofJAN(yn)(14). By admissibility, we mean that the costJAN(yn)yields consistent estimates of the exact channel equalizer when the transmitted signal is i.i.d. or in other words the steady-state overall impulse response (t) is a delta function with arbitrary delay. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the channel, the equalizer and the transmitted signal are real-valued. Note thatmax{|yn|}=max{|an|}∑l|tl|<∞and, owing to i.i.d. property,Eyn2=Ean2∑ltl2. Next we can express the cost (14) intdomain as follows (assuming large B):(15)JAN(t)=∑l|tl|2(∑l|tl|)2Evaluating the gradient w.r.t. kth tap, we obtain(16)∂∂tkJAN=(∑l|tl|)2∂∑jtj2∂tk−(∑ltl2)∂(∑j|tj|)2∂tk(∑l|tl|)4=2(∑l|tl|)2tk−2(∑ltl2)(∑j|tj|)tk|tk|(∑l|tl|)4Equating the above to zero, we get|tk|∑j|tj|−∑ltl2=0. It shows that for a doubly infinite equalizer, the stable global maxima ofJANare along the axis, i.e.(17){|tk|}=δk−k†,k†=…,−1,0,1,…and unstable equilibria are along the diagonal, located at{|tk|}=(1/L)∑j∈ILδk−j, whereIL(L≥2)is any L-element subset of the integer set. The surface of cost (15) is depicted in Fig. 3(a) for a two-tap scenario; it can be seen that the cost is maximized only for the solution specified in (17).Next, incorporating the a priori signal knowledgeγ≔max{|an|}, the cost (14) can be written in a constrained form as follows:(18)w†=argmaxwE|yn|2s.t.max{|yn|}≤γ.The geometry of the cost (18) is depicted in Fig. 3(b) for a two-tap scenario; it can be seen that the cost is maximized when the two balls,∑i|ti|2and∑i|ti|, coincide. The cost (18) is quadratic, and the feasible region (constraint) is a convex set. The problem, however, is non-convex and may have multiple local maxima. Nevertheless, we have the following theorem (refer to [29] for proof):Theorem 2Assumew†is a local optimum inw†=argmaxwE|yn|2s.t.max{|yn|}≤γandt†is the corresponding total channel equalizer impulse-response and channel noise is negligible. Then it holds{|tk|}=δk−k†, wherek†=…,−1,0,1,….Thus an equalizer which is maximizing the output energy and constraining the largest amplitude is able to mitigate the ISI induced by the channel.When an equalizerwoptimizes a costJ=EJ(yn)by the stochastic gradient-based adaptive method, the resulting algorithm iswn=wn−1±μ∂J/∂wn−1⁎, whereμ>0is the step-size, governing the speed of convergence and the level of steady-state performance [30]. The positive and negative signs are for maximization and minimization, respectively.Note that a straightforward gradient-based adaptive implementation ofJANis not possible. The reason is that the order statisticmax{|yn|}is not a differentiable quantity. In [28], however, authors presented an instantaneous and differentiable version of constrainedJANand obtained the following stochastic gradient-based algorithm:(19)wn=wn−1+μfnyn⁎xn,fn={1if|yn|<γ,−βif|yn|≥γ.where β is a constant defined as follows (refer to Appendix B):(20)β≔E|yn|{|yn|<γ}2E|yn|{|yn|≥γ}2The algorithm (19) was termed as beta constant modulus algorithm (βCMA). The βCMA may be kept stable in mean-square sense if its step-size satisfies the condition0<μ<3/(2βtr(R)), wheretr(·)is a trace operator andR=ExnxnHis an autocorrelation matrix [31].In this section, we aim to optimizeJANusing the Newton-like adaptive method. When Newton-like optimization is used by the equalizer, the update for a minimization scenario is given as follows [32]:(21)wn=wn−1−μ(∂2J∂wn−1∂wn−1H)−1(∂J∂wn−1)⁎Firstly, to simplify algebraic manipulation, we suggest the following instantaneous cost function:(22)w†=argminwJnwhereJn≔|fn|||yn|2−γ2|where fnis as specified in (19). It is simple to show that solving (22) by the gradient-based method results in βCMA. For the formulation of a Newton-like scheme, we introduce exponential weights (memory) in (22) as follows:(23)w†=argminwJ˜,whereJ˜≔∑k=0nλn−k|fk|·||wn−1Hxk︸≕yk|2−γ2|and λ is the forgetting factor. When λ equals 1, we have a cost which may be considered as a sort of (infinite memory) least-squares problem. For0<λ<1, however, the cost has effective finite memory (1/(1−λ)) and it may be optimized adaptively using (21). We readily evaluate gradientgnand HessianHnfor (23) as follows:(24)gn≔∂J˜∂wn−1=−∑k=0nfkykxk⁎λn−k,Hn≔∂2J˜∂wn−1∂wn−1H=−∑k=0nfkxkxkHλn−kHere, we encounter a problem. Note that, for the required steady-state condition|yk|≤γimplyingfk=+1,∀k, however, it leads to an undesirable situation(25)Hn=−11−λR^n≼0whereR^n≔∑k=0nxkxkH≽0. So, assuming a converging equalizer, the Hessian is found to be negative definite. It means that such an equalizer will try to maximize the cost instead of minimizing it. This is contrary to the problem definition and we conclude that a straight Newton-like βCMA equalizer, implementing Hessian as specified in(24), will diverge. Simulation study is found in conformation with this argument.One possible way to resolve this matter is to ensure that the recursively computed Hessian remains positive definite. Consider the following solution:(26)Hn=∑k=0n|fk|xkxkHλn−k=λHn−1+|fn|xnxnHInvoking the matrix inversion lemma, we obtain(27)Pn=Hn−1=1λ(Pn−1−Pn−1xnxnHPn−1Hλzn+xnHPn−1xn)wherezn=|fn|−1. It was shown in [33], that the performance of a Newton-like algorithm may be enhanced if znis computed as an iterative estimate, that iszn≡z^n=〈|fn|−1〉where〈·〉represents some averaged estimate of the enclosed entity. One of the possibilities isz^n=z^n−1+1/(n+1)(|fn|−1−z^n−1). Further note thatgn=λgn−1+fnynxn⁎. For λ close to one, the vectorgnwill be dominated by its former estimategn−1, that isgn≈gn−1, and this leads to a simpler expressiongn≈(1−λ)−1fnynxn⁎. With this consideration, the proposed Newton-like βCMA (NL-βCMA) update is given as follows:(28)wn=wn−1+μPnfnyn⁎xn,wherePnis as evaluated in (27) and the factor(1−λ)−1ingnis merged with μ. Note that the recursive calculation ofPnkeeps the computational complexity of the proposed scheme toO(N2)per iteration. The proposed scheme is summarized in Table 1.In this section, we study the steady-state tracking performance of NL-βCMA in a non-stationary environment. Although the steady-state performance essentially corresponds to only one point on the learning curve of the adaptive filter, there are many situations where this information is of value by itself. The addressed approach is based on studying the energy flow through each iteration of an adaptive filter [34,35], and it relies on a fundamental error variance relation that avoids the weight-error variance recursion altogether. We may remark that although we focus on the steady-state performance of NL-βCMA, the same approach can also be used to study the transient (i.e., convergence and stability) behavior of this filter. These details will be provided elsewhere.Consider a non-stationary environment with time-varying optimal weight-vectorwno, also called the Wiener filter, given by(29)wno=wn−1o+qnwhereqnis some random perturbation such thatEqnqnH=Q=σq2I[36]. Using the Wiener solution, the data ancan be expressed asan=(wn−1o)Hxn+vn, where vnis disturbance and is uncorrelated withxn,(Evn⁎xn=0)[36]. The purpose of the tracking analysis of an adaptive filter is to study its ability to track such time variations. The weight error vectorw˜nwhich quantifies how far away the weight vector is from the Wiener solution is given as(30)w˜n=wno−wnThe so-called a posteriori and a priori error are defined asep,n=(w˜n−qn)Hxnandea,n=w˜n−1Hxn, respectively. First consider a generic update expressionwn=wn−1+μPnφn⁎xn. Subtractingwnofrom both sides of this update, substituting its value from (29) and exploiting (30), we get(31)w˜n=w˜n−1−μPnφn⁎xn+qnTaking Hermitian transpose of (31) and post-multiplying byxn, we obtain:(32a)(w˜n−qn)Hxn=w˜n−1Hxn−μxnHPnxnφn(32b)⇒ep,n=ea,n−μφn‖xn‖Pn2where‖xn‖Pn2≔xnHPnxnis the weighted Euclidian norm. From (32b), we haveφn=μ−1‖xn‖Pn−2(ea,n−ep,n),xn≠0. Now, substituting in the value of φnin (31) we get(33)w˜n−qn=w˜n−1−μ˜nPn(ea,n−ep,n)⁎xnwhereμ˜n≔(‖xn‖Pn2)+is used to define pseudo-inverse of‖xn‖Pn2. TakingPn−1weighted norm on both sides and simplifying, we get‖w˜n−qn‖Pn−12on the left and following quantity on the right‖w˜n−1‖Pn−12−μ˜n|ea,n|2+μ˜n|ep,n|2. This results in the energy conservation relation and it is summarized as(34)‖w˜n−qn‖Pn−12+μ˜n|ea,n|2=‖w˜n−1‖Pn−12+μ˜n|ep,n|2Examining the expectation of the left most term of the energy relation, we have(35)E‖w˜n−qn‖Pn−12=E‖w˜n‖Pn−12+E‖qn‖Pn−12−2REqnHPn−1w˜n=E‖w˜n‖Pn−12+E‖qn‖Pn−12−2R(EqnHPn−1w˜n−1+E‖qn‖Pn−12−EqnHxnφn⁎)=E‖w˜n‖Pn−12−E‖qn‖Pn−12where the vanished terms are a result of the following assumptions about the random-walk driving-noise sequence{qn}.(A.1)qnis i.i.d. andEqn=0Q=EqnqnH=σq2I≻0{qn}⊥{xn},{qn}⊥{φn}EPnxnxnH=EPnExnxnH(holds in steady state asPncan be replaced by EPn, see [38])E‖xn‖Pn2|ea,n|2=E‖xn‖Pn2E|ea,n|2(separation principle [38])limn→∞EHn−1=(limn→∞EHn)−1(justified for complex Wishart distribution in [30] and shown to be reasonable via simulations in [38])E‖xn‖Pn2|φn|2=E‖xn‖Pn2E|φn|2(separation principle [38])First, let us solveE‖xn‖Pn2as(39)E‖xn‖Pn2=tr(EPnxnxnH)=tr(EPnExnxnH)=tr(EPnR)Here EPnrequires further investigation.

In this work, we provide performance comparison of NL-βCMA (as summarized in Table 1) with Newton-like CMA (NL-CMA) [32] and recursive least square CMA (RLS-CMA) [43]. The performances of CMA and βCMA are shown as standard benchmark. Moreover, we consider an unorthodox benchmark [44] which is an adaptive method for blind equalization and relies on explicit estimation of PDF using Parzen window and is termed as a stochastic gradient algorithm (SQD). For reference CMA, βCMA, SQD, RLS-CMA and NL-CMA are summarized in Table 2.Here we would like to highlight the following important implementation details: first, for the SQD scheme the required compensation factorF(σ)is computed numerically (see [44] for details). The compensation factorF(σ)is a function of the constellation scheme and hence we find the values ofF(σ)for 16APSK(8,8) using the bisection method (see Fig. 4). The authors of [44] highlight that the use of a smaller σ (e.g., 1) results in an increased number of local minima of the cost function. It is for this reason that we use a higher value of σ (i.e.,σ=15) in all simulations (the correspondingF(σ)is 1.325 as shown in Fig. 4). Secondly, to ensure the stability of NL-CMA, we slightly modify it. According to Miranda et al. [45] one must check the reliability of the error quantity in Hessian. If the statistic of error quantity in Hessian is not reliable, one must adhere to simple autocorrelation matrix. Incorporating this recommendation and owing to sub-Gaussian nature of the transmitted signal, the stability of NL-CMA requires to usezn={(2|yn|2−R2)−1if(2|yn|2−R2)−1≥01otherwise.For simulation purposes, equalizer length is set to N=7 (unless otherwise noted) andw0=[01×⌊(N−1)/2⌋,1,01×⌈(N−1)/2⌉]Ti.e., center tap initialization is used. The data is modulated using 8APSK(4,4) and 16APSK(8,8) shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c). For all experiments, the value of β is obtained using (B.7) (this value is 1.9319 for 8APSK(4,4) and 3 for 16APSK(8,8)). ISI (as defined in (2)) is used as index to evaluate the performance of different equalization schemes. Experiments comparing the proposed scheme to existing equalization methods are discussed in 6.1 and 6.2. Furthermore, additional experiments are carried to compare the theoretical and practical EMSE of the proposed schemes for both 8APSK(4,4) and 16APSK(8,8). The details of these experiments are discussed in 6.3.In this experiment the performance of the proposed scheme is tested for a channel with low eigenvalue spread. The signal is modulated using 16APSK(8,8) and a complex-valued channel with coefficientshR=[−0.005,0.009,−0.024,0.854,−0.218,0.049,−0.016]andhI=[−0.004,0.03,−0.104,0.52,0.273,−0.074,0.02], whereh=hR+jhIis used [46]. The eigenvalue spread of the channel is 5.83. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is set to 30dB and stationary environment is assumed (i.e.,σq=0, where σqis the standard deviation of the perturbationqnin (29)). Learning curves are obtained for 7000 iterations and are ensemble averaged over 200 independent runs. The step sizes and forgetting factors of all schemes are adjusted for comparable performances (i.e., the same steady state ISI) and are mentioned in Fig. 6. It can be observed from Fig. 6 that NL-βCMA shows the fastest convergence rate followed by βCMA.In this experiment, a channel with higher eigenvalue spread is considered. Generally, an increase in the eigenvalue spread of the channel results in poor performance of equalization schemes. For this experiment, the 16APSK(8,8) modulated signal is passed through a channel with impulse responseh=[0,0.1,0.4,0.8,0.4,0.1,0](the eigenvalue spread of this channel is calculated to be 65.28). Again, SNR is set to 30dB and a stationary environment is assumed. The step sizes and forgetting factors of all schemes are adjusted for comparable performances and are summarized in Fig. 7. The learning curves are obtained for 40,000 iterations and are ensemble averaged over 200 independent runs. It can be observed from Fig. 7 that the performance of SQD, CMA and βCMA degrades significantly in comparison with the first experiment. However, it should be noted that NL-CMA, RLS-CMA and NL-βCMA converge relatively faster. Further, among the three fast converging schemes, NL-βCMA shows the fastest convergence rate.In this experiment, analytical and empirical performance of the proposed scheme is compared in a non-stationary environment. In steady state, we assume that the proposed scheme converges in the mean to a zero forcing solution, i.e., the mean of combined channel-equalizer response converges to a delta function with arbitrary delay and phase rotation. We consider a non-stationary channel withσq=10−3, where σqis the standard deviation of the perturbationqnin (29). The equalizer length is set to N=11 and the steady state EMSE is evaluated for 20,000 symbols in a noise-free environment. The forgetting factor is set to 0.98 and step size is varied to obtain the desired curves for both 8APSK(4,4) and 16APSK(8,8). A close match between the analytic and measured EMSE for both constellation types is observed as depicted in Fig. 8.
