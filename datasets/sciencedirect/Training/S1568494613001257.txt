@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Although numerous research studies in recent years have been proposed for comparing and ranking fuzzy numbers, most of the existing approaches suffer from plenty of shortcomings. In particular, they have produced counter-intuitive ranking orders under certain cases, inconsistent ranking orders of the fuzzy numbers’ images, and lack of discrimination power to rank similar and symmetric fuzzy numbers. This study's goal is to propose a new epsilon-deviation degree approach based on the left and right areas of a fuzzy number and the concept of a centroid point to overcome previous drawbacks. The proposed approach defines an epsilon-transfer coefficient to avoid illogicality when ranking fuzzy numbers with identical centroid points and develops two innovative ranking indices to consistently distinguish similar or symmetric fuzzy numbers by considering the decision maker's attitude. The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated through several numerical examples and comparisons with the existing approaches. The results demonstrate that this approach is effective for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers and overcomes the shortcomings in recent studies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Zadeh [1] introduced the fuzzy set theory as a great tool, mathematically representing uncertainty and vagueness in order to efficiently deal with knowledge associated with imprecision. A fuzzy set can greatly reduce uncertainty and has been applied to problems in a variety of fields such as supply chain management, underground mining, weaponry, and so forth [2–9].One of the most useful applications of the fuzzy set theory is in decision making, a cognitive process. The fuzzy set theory describes the approximate information of values and preferences of the decision maker that involve uncertainty, thus generating a decision by ranking fuzzy numbers representing the imprecise numerical measurement of alternatives. However, selecting an optimal alternative among a set of possibilities under a fuzzy environment is complex and challenging.The literature over the past few decades has proposed numerous methods for ranking fuzzy numbers. Some of them are legendary for ranking fuzzy numbers, such as maximizing sets and minimizing sets, centroid points, and distance minimization. Jain [10] proposed the first ranking method using the maximizing set to order fuzzy numbers for selecting an optimal alternative. Yager [11] presented the centroid-index method, Dubios and Prade [12] used the maximizing set to order fuzzy numbers, and Chen [13] proposed the maximizing and minimizing set approach. Chu and Tsao [14] ranked fuzzy numbers with an area between the centroid point and original point. Wang and Yang [15] presented the centroid of fuzzy numbers. Abbasbandy and Asady [16] suggested sign distance, while Asady and Zendehnam [17] proposed the distance minimization method. Other methods have offered revisions to achieve more completeness [18,19], but most of them are unable to give satisfied ranking results for all situations due to the complexity. Many researchers have recently employed maximizing set and minimizing set and the concept of a centroid point as the basis for comparing and ranking fuzzy numbers [20–24]. These methods have mainly concern the correlation between L-R areas and centroid point of a fuzzy number. Wang et al. [20] defined the L-R deviation degree of a fuzzy number and came up with the ranking rule, in which the larger the left deviation degree and the smaller the right deviation degree are, the larger the fuzzy number is. Asady [21] and Nejad Mashinchi [22] redefined the L-R deviation degree of a fuzzy number to overcome the shortcomings of Wang et al. [20]. However, most deviation degree approaches still display the same limitations due to the neglected decision maker's attitude, the incoherent transfer coefficient formula, and the unreliable ranking index computation.To eliminate all these aforementioned drawbacks, this study introduces a new epsilon-deviation degree approach on the basis of maximizing set and minimizing set and centroid point and considers the decision maker's attitude for ranking fuzzy numbers. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the concept of fuzzy numbers, previous approaches and presents the shortcomings through several counter-examples. Section 3 shows the proposed new approach with two innovative indices for ranking fuzzy numbers. The proposed approach is compared with existing approaches. Results and discussions are presented in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5, in which the contributions of this research are presented and the major findings are highlighted.
