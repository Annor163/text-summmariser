In the present paper a robust computational procedure is proposed for the finite element solution of elasto-plastic boundary value problems in the structural analysis of ductile materials. An implicit numerical scheme is detailed based on a return mapping algorithm. In the present computational scheme the local constitutive equations lead to the solution of a nonlinear scalar equation which ultimately reduces to a single variable algebraic (polynomial) equation in the plastic rate parameter. The proposed integration scheme allows to find the analytical solution of the algebraic equation in closed form. Consequently, in the present algorithmic procedure no iterative method is required to solve the local constitutive problem. The algorithmic scheme presented herein is also characterized by an alternative formulation of the algorithmic counterpart of the plastic consistency condition. Furthermore, in the algorithmic strategy a suitable procedure is presented for the consistent linearization of elasto-plastic boundary value problems. In fact an alternative procedure is proposed herein for the consistent derivation of the tangent operator associated to the algorithmic scheme so that in the present approach the consistent tangent operator is determined without the necessity of computing matrix inversions. The presented computational approach combined with the proposed consistent tangent operator ensures a quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence when an iterative method is pursued for the global solution procedure of elasto-plastic boundary value problems. Numerical applications and illustrative examples are finally reported to show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed computational procedure in the finite element analysis of elasto-plastic boundary value problems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Numerical integration procedures for the analysis of elasto-plastic problems appear to have been initially proposed in the form of return mapping algorithms based on an elastic predictor and a plastic corrector scheme introduced by Wilkins [38] and Maenchen and Sack [23]. Extensions to include isotropic and kinematic hardening were presented by Krieg and Key [20], and Krieg and Krieg [21]. Reflections on the accuracy and stability of this class of numerical algorithms were reported e.g. by Krieg and Krieg [21], Ortiz and Popov [26] and Simo [30]. The opportunity of considering a tangent operator consistent with the numerical integration scheme was discussed by Nagtegaal [24] and Simo and Taylor [35] with the aim to preserving the quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence typical of Newton׳s iteration schemes. Among the discussions and proposals for numerical integration schemes we refer to the works presented by, among others, Hughes and Taylor [17], Simo and Govindjee [31], Simo and Govindjee [32], Peric [28], Papadopoulos and Taylor [27], Simo and Hughes [33] and DeAngelis [10]. Numerical integration schemes for applications to non-smooth yield criteria were illustrated by Simo et al. [34] and a tangent operator suitable for general yield criteria was proposed by Alfano et al. [2]. For a comprehensive account see, e.g., Zienkiewicz et al. [40], Wriggers [39], Kojic and Bathe [19] and de Souza Neto et al. [36].In recent years more elaborate constitutive theories have been proposed to capture the behavior of elastoplastic materials subject to complex loading conditions for the need of reproducing the observed features in the loading–unloading–reloading processes. With reference to the more elaborate constitutive theories standard return mapping algorithms require suitable modifications in order to account for nonlinear hardening effects. Moreover repeated loading conditions in elastoplasticity boundary value problems often require extensive calculations which necessitate robust and efficient numerical integration schemes for a proper and accurate simulation of the structural behavior. Among the algorithmic procedures suitable for complex and elaborate loading conditions we refer to the works presented by, among others, Doghri [12], Lubliner et al. [22], Auricchio and Taylor [5], Chaboche and Cailletaud [8], Hopperstad and Remseth [16], Nukala [25], Artioli et al. [4], DeAngelis and Taylor [11].In the present paper a robust algorithmic procedure is proposed for the finite element analysis of small strains elasto-plastic boundary value problems of ductile metals. A return mapping algorithm is adopted to enforce plastic consistency and a nonlinear kinematic hardening mechanism is used to represent the components of the kinematic hardening variables. The proposed algorithmic scheme produces a robust and efficient numerical procedure for the computational simulation of elasto-plastic boundary value problems under elaborate loadings.The present algorithmic scheme has the advantage of reducing the local constitutive equations to a single nonlinear scalar equation. With reference to previously presented proposals in the present approach such nonlinear scalar equation is expressed in a straightforward form since it reduces furtherly to a simple representation of the nonlinear scalar equation namely a single variable algebraic (polynomial) equation in the plastic rate parameter. The present algorithmic approach is therefore simplified with respect to other previously proposed approaches in which the local constitutive equations are also reduced to a nonlinear scalar equation although not to a single variable algebraic (polynomial) equation. In the present algorithmic scheme it is taken advantage of the particularly simple form of the equation since the analytical solutions of the single variable algebraic equation can be found in exact closed form. Consequently, in the present approach no iterative method is required for the solution of the local constitutive problem. In the proposed numerical integration scheme the algorithmic plastic consistency condition is expressed by an alternative form. In addition an alternative procedure is presented for the consistent linearization of elasto-plastic boundary value problems. In fact, a notable feature of the present algorithmic scheme is that the consistent tangent operator is obtained by the following a procedure so that matrix inversions are not required within the present approach. The algorithmic procedure together with the present algorithmic plastic consistency condition and the proposed consistent tangent operator provides a quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence when used with a Newton iterative method for the global solution of elasto-plastic boundary value problems.The effectiveness of the present computational approach is also emphasized for the solution of the local constitutive relations of elasto-plastic boundary value problems. In fact, in the present approach the nonlinear scalar equation is solved in a closed form and thus no numerical methods are required to accelerate or improve the rate of convergence for the solution of the nonlinear scalar equation representing the local constitutive problem. The process of global convergence naturally results in a quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence typical of a Newton iterative method for the global iterative solution procedure of elasto-plastic boundary value problems.Finally, the robustness and the efficiency of the present computational procedure are shown by providing specific numerical examples. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic scheme is illustrated for elasto-plastic boundary value problems subject to complex and elaborate monotonic and cyclic loadings. In the numerical examples the robustness of the computational procedure is emphasized by resulting in a stable and accurate numerical solution procedure for elasto-plastic boundary value problems subject to different types of loading conditions.We consider a continuum bodyBwhich occupies the reference configurationΩ⊂Rn, with1≤n≤3. LetT⊂R+be the time interval of interest,Vthe space of displacements,Dthe strain space andSthe dual stress space. The compatible strain tensor is denoted byε=∇su:Ω×T→D, whereu:Ω×T→Vis the displacement and ∇srepresents the symmetric part of the gradient operator. The stress tensorσ:Ω×T→Sis expressed by(1)σ=s+p1,wheres=defdevσ=σ−p1is the stress deviator,p1is the spherical part,p=def13tr(σ)is the mean stress and 1 is the rank two identity tensor. The relative stressΣis also introduced as(2)Σ=s−α,whereαis the deviatoric back stress.Likewise, the strain tensor is expressed by(3)ε=e+13θ1,wheree=defdevε=ε−13θ1is the strain deviator andθ=deftr(ε)represents the volume change. The deviatoric part of the total strain is additively decomposed into an elastic and a plastic part(4)e=ee+ep,whereeeis the elastic deviatoric strain andepis the plastic deviatoric strain.The pressure and the volume change are related by the elastic constitutive lawp=Kθ, where K represents the bulk modulus. The stress deviator and the elastic deviatoric strain are related by the constitutive law(5)s=2Gee=2G[e−ep],where G represents the shear modulus.The present procedure is proposed within the context of a J2 von Mises yield function form. Accordingly, we assume the class of J2 material models with a limit equation expressed by the yield criterion(6)f(σ,α,κ)=∥devσ−α∥−κ(χiso)=∥Σ∥−23(σyo+χiso)≤0,in whichκ(χiso)=23σy=23(σyo+χiso)is the current radius of the yield surface in the deviatoric plane and σyois the uniaxial yield stress of the virgin material. The conjugate variable related to isotropic hardening is specified asχiso=defR, where R is the increment of the yield stress with respect to the uniaxial yield stress of the virgin material. For linear isotropic hardening it isχiso=Hisoe¯p, where Hisorepresents the isotropic hardening modulus ande¯p=def∫0t23∥ėp∥dtrepresents the equivalent plastic strain. For nonlinear isotropic hardening it is often assumed(7)χiso=Hiso(e¯p)morR=R∞(1−e−be¯p),where m,R∞and b are material parameters.The back stress rate is expressed by Prager׳s law which gives for a linear kinematic hardening behavior [29](8)α̇=23Hkinėp,where Hkinrepresents the kinematic hardening modulus.In the literature a nonlinear kinematic hardening behavior is often assumed by adopting the model proposed by Armstrong and Frederick [3], see also Frederick and Armstrong [13],(9)α̇=23Hkinėp−Hnle¯̇pα,whereHnlis a non-dimensional material dependent parameter which is null in case of linear kinematic hardening.A better approximation for nonlinear kinematic hardening behavior results in adding several components of the back stress, with different recall constants, see e.g. Chaboche [7],(10)α=∑i=1Mαi,α̇i=23Hkin,iėp−Hnl,ie¯̇pαi.For an associative elastoplastic behavior at small strains the evolution flow law is expressed by(11)ėp=γ̇∂f∂σ=γ̇∂f∂Σ=γ̇n,whereγ̇is the plastic rate multiplier.The second rank tensor n is defined by(12)n=defΣ∥Σ∥,and, accordingly, the equivalent plastic strain rate is expressed by(13)e¯̇p=23γ̇.To complete the representation of the elastoplastic model the loading–unloading conditions are introduced according to the Kuhn–Tucker optimality conditions(14)γ̇≥0,f(σ,α,κ)≤0,γ̇f(σ,α,κ)=0,see e.g. Crisfield [9], Simo and Hughes [33] and Zienkiewicz et al. [40].The proposed formulation may be investigated to include more hardening functions, whereas the treatment of more general yield functions is outside the scope of the present analysis.We consider a return mapping discrete formulation based on an elastic prediction and a plastic correction algorithmic scheme. According to a time discrete formulation the time interval of interest[0,T]⊂R+is subdivided into a finite number of time stepstn→tn+1. The generic variable at time tnis assumed to be known as evaluated at the previous time step and the value of the variable at timetn+1is to be evaluated according to the discrete form of the evolutive equations. The generic variableuevaluated at time tnwill be denoted with the subscript n, so thatun=u(tn), whereas to simplify notation the same variable with no subscript will denote the updated value of the variable at timetn+1, so thatu=u(tn+1). We also consider a strain driven approach, accordingly the solution at time tnis known and given by the ordered set(15)(σn,εn,sn,en,enp,e¯np,αn).The value of the increment of the displacement fieldΔu=defu−unis assigned at time tn, which corresponds to assigning the value of the total strainε=εn+∇s(Δu)at timetn+1. Consequently, we need to compute the solution at timetn+1represented by the ordered set(16)(σ,ε,s,e,ep,e¯p,α)according to the discrete forms of the evolutive elastoplasticity laws.In the framework of a backward Euler integration scheme, the evolutive equation for the deviatoric plastic strain rate (11) in discrete form is expressed by(17)ep=enp+λn,and the equivalent plastic strain rate (13) in discrete form is expressed by(18)e¯p=e¯np+23λ,where we have setλ=defΔγn+1=γ̇n+1Δt.Given Eq. (17), the updated value of the deviatoric stress is expressed by(19)s=2G[e−enp]−2Gλn,and the updated back stress in discrete form is expressed by(20)α−αn=23Hkinλn−Hnl23λα,which can be also written as(21)α=Tλαn+23HkinTλλn,where we have set(22)Tλ=1(1+23Hnlλ)=1Rλ,Rλ=(1+23Hnlλ).In the above expressions and in the sequel the superscript λ is used to point out a dependence of the variable on the increment of the plastic rate multiplier in the step. It will be noted in the sequel that this feature is typical of a nonlinear kinematic hardening behavior.Accordingly, the updated value of the relative stress is expressed by(23)Σ=s−α=2G[e−enp]−Tλαn−Uλn,where(24)Uλ=[2G+23HkinRλ]λ=[2G+23HkinTλ]λ.In the framework of a predictor–corrector scheme, for each time step[tn,tn+1], in the first part of the algorithm (elastic predictor) a trial state is computed by assuming a purely elastic behavior in the step. If the trial elastic stress state satisfies the yield condition (6), then it is accepted as the solution attn+1, otherwise in the second part of the algorithm (plastic corrector) a plastic correction is computed to correct the trial elastic state according to the discrete forms of the evolutive elastoplasticity laws.Consequently, in the generic time steptn→tn+1, the trial elastic state is computed by assuming that the material behavior is purely elastic and the plastic components of the strains are unchanged and set equal to those at time tn(elastic prediction):(25){λTR=0ep,TR=enpe¯p,TR=e¯npsTR=2G[e−enp]αTR=αnΣTR=sTR−αTR=sTR−αn.The yielding condition (6) is then checked at timetn+1as a function of the trial values. If the elastic trial state lies within the boundary of the elastic domain then it is an admissible state. In such case the elastic trial state is assumed as the solution at timetn+1and the second part of the algorithm is skipped. Conversely, if the elastic trial state is not admissible then a plastic correction is performed. The increment λ of the plastic rate parameter is computed by enforcing the satisfaction of the nonlinear limit equations at timetn+1as specified in the next section. The normal n to the yield surface is also computed as specified in the next section. Consequently, the updated variables are computed by projecting the trial elastic state onto the boundary of the elastic domain. The variables are therefore updated in terms of the trial elastic state, the increment λ of the plastic rate parameter in the step and the normal n to the yield surface by fulfilling the discrete forms of the evolutive elastoplasticity laws (plastic correction):(26){ep=ep,TR+λne¯p=e¯p,TR+23λs=sTR−2Gλnα=TλαTR+23HkinTλλnΣ=ΣTR+(1−Tλ)αTR−Uλn.Consequently, in the generic time steptn→tn+1which requires a plastic correction, after computing the normal n to the yield surface and the increment λ of the plastic rate parameter, the variables are updated at timetn+1according to Eqs. (26).The updated value of the relative stress is expressed by(27)Σ=ΣTR+(1−Tλ)αTR−Uλn=sTR−TλαTR−Uλn.In Eq. (27) the termΣTR=sTR−αTRis the trial value of the relative stress for the case of plasticity with a linear kinematic hardening rule. In particular we observe thatΣTRis independent of λ.In the present context characterized by nonlinear kinematic hardening rules we find convenient to set a trial-like value of the relative stress for plasticity with nonlinear kinematic hardening as(28)ΣTRλ=ΣTR+(1−Tλ)αTR=sTR−TλαTR.This is at variance with the case of linear kinematic hardening since now, for nonlinear kinematic hardening, the trial-like value of the relative stressΣTRλdepends upon λ. Accordingly, the updated value of the relative stress (27) at timetn+1is expressed by(29)Σ=ΣTRλ−Uλn.The normal n to the yield surface is determined by(30)n=∂f∂σ=∂f∂Σ∂Σ∂σ=∂f∂Σ∂(devσ−α)∂σ=∂∥Σ∥∂ΣIdev=Σ∥Σ∥Idev=Σ∥Σ∥,whereIdev=I−13(1⊗1).It is noted that in plasticity with nonlinear kinematic hardening rules the normal to the yield surface n also depends upon λ. This differs with the standard case of plasticity with linear kinematic hardening rules, in which the tensor n is independent from λ. Accordingly Eq. (30) is expressed by(31)n(λ)=Σ(λ)∥Σ(λ)∥,that is the normaln(λ)to the yield surface at timetn+1is evaluated based on the updated value of the relative stressΣ(λ)at timetn+1.From the above equation we observe thatΣ(λ)is collinear withn(λ). Accordingly, from Eq. (29) we obtain thatΣTRλ(λ)must also be collinear withn(λ), and consequently we can writeΣTRλ(λ)=∥ΣTRλ(λ)∥n(λ).Therefore the updated normal to the yield surface can also be alternatively expressed by(32)n(λ)=ΣTRλ(λ)∥ΣTRλ(λ)∥,that is the normaln(λ)to the yield surface at timetn+1can also be determined based on the trial-like (not updated) value of the relative stressΣTRλ(λ).In the numerical scheme recently proposed by DeAngelis and Taylor [11], the determination of the updated normal to the yield surface was based on the expression (31). At variance with such approach in the present numerical scheme we will evaluate both the normal to the yield surfacen(λ)and its differential based on the expression (32). In the sequel we will show that this approach leads to a simplified numerical scheme and a simplified expression of the consistent tangent operator.The limit condition is provided by the condition (6) and enforced at timetn+1by(33)∥Σ(λ)∥−23σy(λ)=0.In this section we show that within the present algorithmic approach the above nonlinear scalar equation may be expressed as an algebraic (polynomial) equation in λ. This equation is to be solved for the increment λ of the plastic rate parameter in the steptn→tn+1.In the previous section it has been shown that bothΣ(λ)andΣTRλ(λ)are collinear withn(λ). Accordingly, Eq. (29) yields the following relation:(34)∥Σ(λ)∥=∥ΣTRλ(λ)∥−Uλ.By considering Eq. (34), the limit condition (33) yields(35)∥ΣTRλ(λ)∥−Uλ−23σy=0.The term∥ΣTRλ(λ)∥is expressed as(36)∥ΣTRλ(λ)∥=[Sss−2SsαTλ+Sαα(Tλ)2]1/2,where we have set(37)Sss=sTR·sTR=∥sTR∥2Ssα=sTR·αTRSαα=αTR·αTR=∥αTR∥2.Accordingly, Eq. (35) is specialized to(38)Sss(Rλ)2−2SsαRλ+Sαα=4G2(Rλ)2λ2+83GHkinRλλ2+49Hkin2λ2+4G23σy(Rλ)2λ+43Hkin23σyRλλ+23σy2(Rλ)2.The yield stress is expressed by(39)σy=σyo+Hisoe¯n+1p=σyo+Hiso(e¯np+23λ)=σy,n+Hiso23λ,and, by recalling the expression (22)2 forRλ, Eq. (38) gives the nonlinear scalar equation(40)g(λ)=C1λ4+C2λ3+C3λ2+C4λ+C5=0,where the coefficients of the equation are provided byC1=[83G2Hnl2+169GHisoHnl2+827Hiso2Hnl2],C2=[823G2Hnl+8323GHkinHnl+8323GHnl2σy,n+16323GHisoHnl+8923HkinHisoHnl+8923Hiso2Hnl+8923HisoHnl2σy,n],C3=[4G2+83GHkin+49Hkin2+163GHnlσy,n+83GHiso+89HkinHiso+89HkinHnlσy,n+49Hiso2+169HisoHnlσy,n+49Hnl2σy,n2−23Hnl2Sss],C4=[423Gσy,n+4323Hkinσy,n+4323Hisoσy,n+4323Hnlσy,n2−223Hnl(Sss−Ssα)],(41)C5=[23σy,n2−(Sss−2Ssα+Sαα)].The nonlinear scalar equation (40) represents an algebraic (polynomial) equation which is to be solved for the computation of λ in the generic time steptn→tn+1. Accordingly, one of the advantages of the present algorithmic approach is that the local solution of the constitutive equations reduces to only one nonlinear scalar equation, with the form presented herein. It is to be noted that in the literature other proposals have been presented for algorithmic schemes which also reduce the local solution of the constitutive equations to one nonlinear scalar equation, see e.g. Hartmann et al. [15] and Kobayashi and Ohno [18]. At variance with such proposals, in the present approach the constitutive equations reduce to a straightforward and simple form of nonlinear scalar equation which ultimately boils down to a single variable algebraic (polynomial) equation. Furthermore it is noted that for complex constitutive equations and highly nonlinear scalar equations the solution performed via a Newton iterative method sometimes experiences failures and does not always converge due to the occurring high gradients and the resulting round-off errors. In the sequel it is shown that the herein proposed approach leads naturally to an algorithmic scheme which ensures efficiency and robustness to the computational procedure. In particular it is emphasized that with the present algorithmic scheme no numerical procedures are required to accelerate or improve the rate of convergence for the solution of the nonlinear scalar equation, such as for instance Aitken׳s process adopted in Kobayashi and Ohno [18]. Moreover, it is emphasized that with the present algorithmic approach the research for the analytical solutions of the single variable algebraic (polynomial) equation (40) can be pursued in a closed form, i.e. with no recourse to iterative methods.In fact, the quartic equation (40) can be solved in a closed form for the real positive roots, see e.g. among others Abramowitz [1], Beyer [6], Hacke [14]. The increment of the plastic rate parameter λ is therefore evaluated, in the steptn→tn+1, as the smallest positive real root of the quartic equation (40).The proposed approach leads naturally to a robust and effective computational solution procedure for elastoplastic structural problems subject to complex loading conditions.For the derivation of the algorithmic plastic consistency condition we operate by assuming the updated normaln(λ)to the yield surface as expressed by Eq. (32) and evaluated as a function of the trial-like value of the relative stress. Likewise, in the limit condition the relative stress at timetn+1is expressed as a function of the trial-like value of the relative stress. In the enforcement of the plastic consistency condition the differentiation of the terms stems from such positions.We note that this approach is at variance with the approach presented by DeAngelis and Taylor [11] in which the normal to the yield surface at timetn+1was based on the expression (31) and evaluated as a function of the updated relative stress at timetn+1and the limit condition and its differentiation were expressed as a function of the updated relative stress. In the sequel we will show that the approach presented herein provides an alternative formulation of the algorithmic plastic consistency condition and an alternative and simplified algorithmic scheme.Given the relation (34), at timetn+1the limit condition (33) is expressed by(42)f=∥ΣTRλ∥−Uλ−23σy=0.The enforcement of the consistency conditiondf=0provides(43)df=d[∥ΣTRλ∥]−dUλ−d[23(σy,n+Hiso23λ)]=0.The first differential of the plastic consistency condition (43) is expressed by(44)d[∥ΣTRλ∥]=dΣTRλ(∥ΣTRλ∥)dΣTRλ=ΣTRλ∥ΣTRλ∥dΣTRλ=ndΣTRλ,and the termdΣTRλis given by(45)dΣTRλ=d[sTR−TλαTR]=dsTR−d[TλαTR]=dsTR−[d(Tλ)αTR+TλdαTR]=dsTR−[dλ(Tλ)dλ·αTR]=dsTR+HλαTRdλ,in which, respectively,dαTR=0sinceαTR=αn, and the derivativedλTλis expressed by(46)dλTλ=dλ[11+23Hnlλ]=−23Hnl(1+223Hnlλ+23Hnl2λ2)=−Hλ,where we have set(47)Hλ=23Hnl(1+223Hnlλ+23Hnl2λ2)=23Hnl(Rλ)2=23Hnl(Tλ)2.Given the expression (25)4, it resultsdsTR=2Gde, and the relation (45) specializes to(48)dΣTRλ=dsTR+HλαTRdλ=2Gde+HλαTRdλ.Accordingly, the first contribution (44) of the plastic consistency condition (43) is expressed by(49)d[∥ΣTRλ∥]=ndΣTRλ=n·(2Gde+HλαTRdλ)=2G[n·de]+Hλ(αn·n)dλ=2G[n·de]+23Hnl(Tλ)2(αn·n)dλ.The second contribution of the plastic consistency condition (43) is given by(50)dUλ=dλ[2Gλ+(23HkinTλ)λ]dλ=[2G+dλ(23HkinTλ)·λ+(23HkinTλ)]dλ=[2G−23HkinHλλ+23HkinTλ]dλ=[2G+23HkinTλ−23Hkin23Hnl(Tλ)2λ]dλ.The third contribution of the plastic consistency condition (43) is provided by(51)d[23(σy,n+Hiso23λ)]=dλ[23Hisoλ]dλ=23Hisodλ.Accordingly, the plastic consistency condition (43) specializes to(52)df=2G[n·de]+23Hnl(Tλ)2(αn·n)dλ−[2G+23HkinTλ−23Hkin23Hnl(Tλ)2λ]dλ−23Hisodλ=0,and it results(53)2G[n·de]=[2G+23Hiso+23HkinTλ−23Hnl(Tλ)2(n·αn)−23Hkin23Hnl(Tλ)2λ]dλ.The above equation can be represented by(54)dλ=A¯d[n·de],where we have set(55)A¯d=2G[2G+23Hiso+23HkinTλ−23Hnl(Tλ)2(n·αn)−23Hkin23Hnl(Tλ)2λ]We note that the algorithmic plastic consistency condition (54) and the associated discrete algorithmic coefficient (55) differ from the algorithmic plastic consistency condition presented by DeAngelis and Taylor [11] due to the different algorithmic scheme adopted herein.In particular the algorithmic plastic consistency condition and the associated discrete algorithmic coefficient presented by DeAngelis and Taylor [11] depend onα, that is they necessitate the evaluation of the updated value of the back stress at timetn+1. Conversely, in the present algorithmic scheme the expressions of the algorithmic plastic consistency condition and the associated discrete algorithmic coefficient (55) do not require the evaluation of the updated value of the back stress, since they depend onαnthat is the value of the back stress at time tnas evaluated at the previous converged time step. This device simplifies notably the algorithmic scheme and it ensures robustness to the process of convergence and to the overall effectiveness of the computational procedure.In the present section we derive the expression of the consistent tangent operator associated to the proposed algorithmic scheme. One of the advantages of the present algorithmic scheme is that the consistent tangent operator is readily obtained in a simplified form with respect to other algorithmic schemes, see e.g. Auricchio and Taylor [5] and DeAngelis and Taylor [11], in which it is required the inversion of a matrix. Remarkably, in the present algorithmic approach no computation of matrix inversions is requested for the determination of the consistent tangent operator and thus the determination of the consistent tangent operator is notably simplified.In fact in evaluating the differential of the normal to the yield surfacen(λ)it is customary to differentiate the expression (31), that is the normal to the yield surface at timetn+1is evaluated as a function of the updated value of the relative stressΣ(λ)at timetn+1. Conversely, in the present algorithmic scheme we assumen(λ)as expressed by Eq. (32), that is the normal to the yield surface at timetn+1is evaluated as a function of the trial-like value of the relative stressΣTRλ(λ). We will show that this strategy simplifies the algorithmic procedure and for the determination of the consistent tangent operator the necessity of evaluating inverse matrices is avoided.By assuming Eq. (32) the differential of the normaln(λ)to the yield surface is provided by(56)dn=dΣTRλndΣTRλwheredΣTRλnis expressed by(57)dΣTRλn=1∥ΣTRλ∥2(I∥ΣTRλ∥−ΣTRλ⊗ΣTRλ∥ΣTRλ∥)=1∥ΣTRλ∥(I−n⊗n),and, given the expression (48), it results(58)dΣTRλ=2Gde+Hλαndλ.Eq. (56) is therefore expressed by(59)dn=1∥ΣTRλ∥(I−n⊗n)(2Gde+Hλαndλ)=2G∥ΣTRλ∥(I−n⊗n)de+1∥ΣTRλ∥(I−n⊗n)Hλαndλ.By differentiating Eq. (19) we get(60)ds=2Gde−2Gdλn−2Gλdn,and, by recalling the algorithmic plastic consistency condition (54) and the differential of the normal to the yield surface (59), we can write(61)ds=2Gde−2GA¯d[n·de]n−2Gλ[2G∥ΣTRλ∥Ide−2G∥ΣTRλ∥(n⊗n)de+1∥ΣTRλ∥(I−n⊗n)Hλαndλ].By considering the algorithmic plastic consistency condition (54) it follows(62)ds=2Gde−2GA¯d(n⊗n)de−2Gλ[2G∥ΣTRλ∥Ide−2G∥ΣTRλ∥(n⊗n)de]−[2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥(I−n⊗n)HλA¯d(αn⊗n)de],and, accordingly,(63)ds=2G(1−2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥)de+2G(2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥−A¯d)(n⊗n)de−2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥(I−n⊗n)HλA¯d(αn⊗n)de,from which we deduce(64)ds=2G(1−2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥)de+2G(2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥−A¯d)(n⊗n)de−2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥HλA¯d(αn⊗n)de+2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥HλA¯d(n⊗n)(αn⊗n)de.By recalling that(n⊗n)(αn⊗n)=(n·αn)(n⊗n), the above equation specializes to(65)ds=[2G(1−2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥)I+2G(2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥−A¯d)(n⊗n)−2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥HλA¯d(αn⊗n)+2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥HλA¯d(n·αn)(n⊗n)]deand, accordingly,(66)ds={2G(1−2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥)I+[2G(2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥−A¯d)+2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥HλA¯d(n·αn)](n⊗n)−[2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥HλA¯d](αn⊗n)}de.By considering the position (47), the above equation is expressed by(67)ds={2G(1−2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥)I+[2G(2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥−A¯d)+A¯d(Tλ)22Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥23Hnl(n·αn)](n⊗n)−[A¯d(Tλ)22Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥23Hnl](αn⊗n)}de.Consequently, in terms of the total stresses and strains and combined with the elastic volumetric terms the consistent tangent operator is represented by(68)Ddiscr={K(1⊗1)+[2G(1−2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥)]Idev+[2G(2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥−A¯d)+A¯d(Tλ)22Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥23Hnl(n·αn)](n⊗n)−[A¯d(Tλ)22Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥23Hnl](αn⊗n)},which can also be expressed by(69)Ddiscr={K(1⊗1)+[2G(1−C¯d)]Idev+[2G(C¯d−A¯d)+B¯d(n·αn)](n⊗n)−B¯d(αn⊗n)},where we have set(70)C¯d=2Gλ∥ΣTRλ∥,B¯d=A¯d(Tλ)2C¯d23Hnl,Tλ=1Rλ,Rλ=(1+23Hnlλ),A¯d=2G[2G+23Hiso+23HkinTλ−23Hnl(Tλ)2(n·αn)−23Hkin23Hnl(Tλ)2λ].Given the formulations of the coefficients (70), the expression (69) represents the consistent tangent operator associated to the proposed algorithmic scheme. Accordingly, an alternative procedure is proposed for the consistent linearization of elasto-plastic boundary value problems. It is emphasized that the adopted algorithmic strategy has resulted in the expression of the consistent tangent operator in a simplified manner. In fact, at variance with other approaches the consistent tangent operator(69)is determined without computing matrix inversions.We also emphasize that the present form of consistent tangent operator differs significantly from the expression presented by DeAngelis and Taylor [11], in which the normaln(λ)to the yield surface was determined based on the expression (31), that isn(λ)was computed as a function of the updated value of the relative stressΣ(λ)at timetn+1. Conversely, in the expression (69) of the consistent tangent operator the normaln(λ)to the yield surface is evaluated based on the expression (32), that is the normaln(λ)to the yield surface is computed based on the trial-like value of the relative stressΣTRλ(λ)and it does not need to be updated until convergence is attained.Furthermore, it is worthwhile to note that the expression of the consistent tangent operator presented by DeAngelis and Taylor [11] depends on the updated value of the back stressαas evaluated at timetn+1. Remarkably, both the formulation (69) of the consistent tangent operator and the associated coefficients (70) are expressed as a function of the back stressαnwhich is the back stress at time tn, that is as evaluated at the previous converged time step. Accordingly, one need not to update it until convergence is achieved.These characteristical features of the proposed algorithmic scheme simplify significantly the numerical integration problem by providing robustness and effectiveness to the overall computational procedure. In fact, as detailed in the sequel, it is emphasized that the proposed computational approach preserves the quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence for the global solution problem typical of computationally efficient numerical integration schemes. Accordingly, the present numerical procedure does not require the use of specific numerical methods for increasing the rate of convergence of the local problem since the solution of the nonlinear scalar equation is provided in exact closed form, that is with no recourse to iterative methods. In addition, the consistent tangent operator (69) ensures a quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence for the solution of the global problem. Consequently, the proposed algorithmic scheme naturally leads to a robust and effective computational approach for elasto-plastic boundary value problems subject to complex and elaborate loading conditions.In the present section we show that the proposed algorithmic scheme provides a robust and effective computational procedure for the solution of the global problem by preserving the quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence typical of computationally efficient numerical integration schemes. Accordingly, the proposed algorithmic approach represents an efficient computational scheme for elasto-plastic boundary value problems subject to complex loading conditions.The numerical scheme has been implemented into a Finite Element Analysis Program (FEAP), see Zienkiewicz et al. [40] and Taylor [37]. The algorithmic scheme presented in this paper may be adopted with any 2 or 3-d element that accepts a strain-driven approach. In our analyses we use 4-node quadrilateral elements with 2×2 Gaussian quadrature and the mixed approach described in Sec. 2.6.2 of Zienkiewicz et al. [40]. The convergence of the finite element solution is measured in terms of the residual norm and the energy norm, where the energy norm is computed by the residual and the incremental displacement vector. For the i-th load step the relative values of the norms are the norm values evaluated at the i-th iteration divided by the corresponding value of the norm at the first iteration.We consider the boundary value problem of a tension strip. The example represents a plane strain problem of a square strip with a circular hole, with a ratio of the radius of the circle over half of the side length equal to r/h=0.1. The geometry of the problem is illustrated in Fig. 1. The radius of the circular hole is r=10mm. The dimension of the side of the square section is assumed to be L=2h=200mm. For symmetry reasons only 1/4 of the strip needs to be considered. The dimension of the side of the section containing 1/4 of the strip is therefore h=100mm. The adopted mesh consists of 992 nodes and 900 elements. The material properties are assumed to be elastic modulusE=208000MPa, Poisson׳s ratio ν=0.3, yield limitσyo=170MPa, kinematic hardening modulusHkin=41080MPa, nonlinear kinematic hardening parameterHnl=525, isotropic hardening modulusHiso=2100MPa. The load is applied by prescribing the distributed traction at the top and bottom boundaries of the section. The imposed traction has been assigned asqo=220MPa. A proportional load coefficient p(t) amplifies the prescribed traction and describes the loading history according to the time lawq(t)=p(t)qo.In the sequel the plots of the end stress versus the average strain are illustrated. The end stress is the distributed traction at the top and bottom boundaries of the section and the average strain is a measure of the strain evaluated as the displacement of the boundary upper edge at vertical axis of symmetry over the height. The contour plots of the Mises stress in the strip are also reported, where the Mises stress is defined as3J2=32∥s∥2. The contour plots of the Mises stress are plotted for the whole strip by exploiting symmetry properties.We assume a complex loading program in tension–compression with increasing both levels of loading. The loading history adopted in this example is illustrated in Fig. 2. The corresponding curve of the end stress versus the average strain is reported in Fig. 3, and the related contour plot of the Mises stress in the strip at timetmax=13is illustrated in Fig. 4.For the given cyclic loading program the iterations required for convergence and the relative residual norm values are reported in Table 1. For a complete evaluation of the convergence the relative energy norm values are also reported in Table 2. The tables clearly illustrate the quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence of the algorithmic procedure.A complex loading program in tension–compression with decreasing both levels of loading is considered by assuming the loading history described in Fig. 5. The end stress versus the average strain is plotted in Fig. 6and the final contour plot of the Mises stress in the strip fortmax=13is illustrated in Fig. 7.Let us consider a loading program in tension–compression with same levels of loading by assuming the loading history illustrated in Fig. 8. For the assigned loading program the end stress versus the average strain is described in Fig. 9and the final contour plot of the Mises stress in the strip fortmax=13is given in Fig. 10.We now test the algorithmic procedure by assuming a loading program with increasing mean value of loading and consider the loading history described in Fig. 11. For the assigned loading program the corresponding curve of the end stress versus the average strain is illustrated in Fig. 12and the final contour plot of the Mises stress in the strip fortmax=13is plotted in Fig. 13.For the assigned loading program the iterations required for convergence and the relative residual norm values are reported in Table 3. The relative energy norm values are also reported in Table 4. Accordingly, the quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence of the adopted algorithmic procedure is clearly shown also for this type of cyclic loading program.In order to show the performance of the proposed algorithmic procedure in a bending and shearing dominated response, we consider the numerical test of a tapered panel clamped on one end and subjected to an in-plane shearing load on the free end. The geometry of the problem is illustrated in Fig. 14. The height of the clamped end is 44mm. The height of the free end is 16mm. The horizontal projection of the membrane is 48mm. By setting a reference system centered in the lower corner of the clamped end, the coordinates of the lower corner of the free end are (48, 44), the coordinates of the upper corner of the free end are (48, 60), the coordinates of the upper corner of the clamped end are (0, 44). We assumed 40 elements in x1-direction and 40 elements in x2-direction. Accordingly, the adopted mesh consists of 1600 elements and 1681 nodes. The adopted material properties are elastic modulus E=208000MPa, Poisson׳s ratio ν=0.3, yield limitσyo=170MPa, kinematic hardening modulusHkin=41080MPa, nonlinear kinematic hardening parameterHnl=525, isotropic hardening modulusHiso=2100MPa. The loading is applied on the free end of the membrane by prescribing a uniformly distributed tangential load initially directed upwards. The imposed distributed shear has been assigned asso=100MPa. The proportional load coefficient p(t) modifies in time the imposed distributed tangential load. Accordingly, the loading history is described by the time laws(t)=p(t)so.In the sequel we report the plot of the applied total load versus the vertical displacement of the upper corner of the free end of the membrane, the contour plots of the displacements and the contour plots of the stresses in the membrane.The algorithmic procedure is tested by assigning a cyclic loading program with increasing mean value of the loading. In the numerical test we assume the loading history as described in Fig. 11. For the assigned cyclic loading program the plot of the applied total load versus the vertical displacement of the upper corner of the free end of the membrane is reported in Fig. 15. The contour plot of the vertical displacements of the membrane subjected to the distributed tangential loading on the free end is illustrated in Fig. 16at timetmax=13. The contour plot of the horizontal displacements of the membrane at timetmax=13is shown in Fig. 17.The contour plot of the 11-stress in the membrane at timetmax=13is illustrated in Fig. 18. The contour plot of the 22-stress in the membrane at timetmax=13is reported in Fig. 19. The contour plot of the 12-stress in the membrane at timetmax=13is shown in Fig. 20.The contour plot of the Mises stress in the membrane at time t=5 is illustrated in Fig. 21. The contour plot of the Mises stress at time t=5.5 is reported in Fig. 22. The final contour plot of the Mises stress in the membrane at timetmax=13is shown in Fig. 23.For the examined problem the iterations required for convergence and the relative residual norm values are illustrated in Table 5. The relative energy norm values are reported in Table 6for a complete evaluation of the convergence. The adopted algorithmic procedure is characterized by a quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence. Consequently, the robustness and effectiveness of the presented algorithmic procedure is clearly shown.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In recent years constitutive models have been proposed in the literature with the aim of reproducing more refined characteristical material properties in the loading processes. Accordingly, standard return mapping algorithms require the suitable modifications in order to account for complex and elaborate loading conditions by preserving robustness and efficiency in the numerical integration of elasto-plastic boundary value problems. As a matter of fact finite element methods may require extensive computations in the structural analysis of nonlinear elasto-plastic boundary value problems, in particular when analyzing structural problems subject to complex and elaborate loading conditions.In the present paper a robust computational procedure has been illustrated which is well suited for applications to elasto-plastic boundary value problems subject to elaborate loading conditions. The proposed algorithmic scheme reduces the local constitutive problem to only one nonlinear scalar equation. In addition, in the present approach such nonlinear scalar equation has been expressed in a particularly simple form since it has been downsized furtherly to a single variable algebraic equation. The straightforwardness of such nonlinear scalar equation has allowed to finding the analytical solutions of the algebraic equation in a closed form. Accordingly, in the present approach no iterative method is required for the solution of the local constitutive problem.A computational scheme has been presented which is characterized by an alternative expression of the algorithmic plastic consistency condition. The algorithmic scheme is furtherly characterized by an alternative procedure for the consistent linearization of the elasto-plastic boundary value problem. In fact, within the present approach the related expression of the consistent tangent operator is determined so that, remarkably, matrix inversions are not required. Accordingly, one of the advantages of the present computational approach is the determination of the consistent tangent operator in a simplified form without the necessity of computing inverse matrices.It has also been noted that in the proposed approach no numerical method is needed to accelerate or improve the rate of convergence for the local solution problem. In fact in the present algorithmic scheme the solution of the nonlinear scalar equation is provided in exact closed form. Thus, no iterative method is required for the solution of the local constitutive problem. The present computational procedure together with the derived consistent tangent operator has shown to provide a quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence when used with a Newton iterative method for the global solution of nonlinear elasto-plastic boundary value problems subject to complex loading conditions. The process of convergence for the global iterative solution procedure of elasto-plastic boundary value problems naturally results in a quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence typical of computationally effective iterative solution schemes.Finally, the efficiency of the proposed computational scheme has been shown with regard to specific numerical examples. In the numerical examples the robustness and the effectiveness of the algorithmic procedure have been illustrated for elasto-plastic boundary value problems subject to different types of loading conditions.In perspective possible future research work is the generalization of the proposed algorithmic framework to other constitutive models. In fact a notable feature of the present algorithmic scheme is the capability of being extensible to more refined elasto-plastic constitutive models. The present algorithmic framework can also comprehend different constitutive models characterized by the same type of kinematic hardening rules, such as elastoviscoplasticity and damage constitutive models.
