@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Without using a technical language, but using the universal language of mathematics, we provide simple but significant laws, as Deficit Formula, Balance Law and Liability Formula, for the management of the world economy. Decisions, under these laws, for the recovery of the economy and for the good governance clearly appear. Further a simple but useful economical indicatorE(t)is provided and the results are illustrated with a significant example.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper a general equilibrium model of financial flows and prices is considered. The model is assumed to evolve in time. The equilibrium conditions are considered in a dynamic sense and the governing variational inequality formulation is presented. Using delicate tools of Nonlinear Analysis and especially some properties of the dual model (the so-called shadow problem), which are not always intuitive, the optimal composition of assets, liabilities and prices is determined and a qualitative analysis of the equilibrium is performed. In fact, in order to obtain the recovery of the economy, in Section 7 the propositions which derive from the analysis of the financial equilibrium, namely from the Deficit Formula, the Balance Law and the Liability Formula, are provided for the convenience of the decision-makers of the world economy. These propositions are written not by means of a technical language, but by means of the universal language of mathematics, which allows everyone to evaluate the consequences of each choice in terms of equilibrium. Moreover a simple but useful indicator of the economyE(t)is provided and its effectiveness is illustrated by means of a significant example. The other sections of the paper are organized in the following way: in Section 2 the detailed financial model is presented, in Section 3 we recall the infinite dimensional Lagrange duality, in Section 4 we provide the proofs of the steps which lead to the variational inequality of the governing equilibrium conditions, in Section 5 we give some existence results, in Section 6 we provide an application of the infinite dimensional duality to the general financial equilibrium problem from which the Deficit Formula, the Balance Law and the Liability Formula follow. In Section 8 a significant example illustrates the results obtained and the impact that the components of the model have on the equilibrium.The first authors to develop a multi-sector, multi-instrument financial equilibrium model using the variational inequality theory were Nagurney, Dong, and Hughes (1992). These results were, subsequently, extended by Nagurney (1994, 2001) to include more general utility functions and by Nagurney and Siokos (1997a, 1997b) to the international domain (see also Jaillet, Lamberton, & Lapeyre, 1990; Tourin & Zariphopoulou, 1994 for related papers). In Dong, Zhang, and Nagurney (1996), the authors apply for the first time the methodology of projected dynamical systems to develop a multi-sector, multi-instrument financial model, whose set of stationary points coincides with the set of solutions to the variational inequality model developed in Nagurney (1994), and then to study it qualitatively, providing stability analysis results. Recently in Barbagallo, Daniele, and Maugeri (2012); Daniele (2003a, 2003b, 2005); Daniele, Giuffrè, and Pia (2005) more general models have been studied allowing that the data are evolving over time. The more significant paper in this sense is Barbagallo et al. (2012), which we generalize and in addition we enrich by introducing Section 7 devoted to the economy recovery.Now we describe in detail the model we are dealing with. We consider a financial economy consisting of m sectors, for example households, domestic business, banks and other financial institutions, as well as state and local governments, with a typical sector denoted by i, and of n instruments, for example mortgages, mutual funds, saving deposits, money market funds, with a typical financial instrument denoted by j, in the time interval[0,T]. Letsi(t)denote the total financial volume held by sector i at time t as assets, and letli(t)be the total financial volume held by sector i at time t as liabilities. Then, unlike previous papers (see Daniele, 2003a, 2003b, 2005, 2006, 2010; Daniele et al., 2005), we allow markets of assets and liabilities to have different investmentssi(t)andli(t), respectively. Since we are working in the presence of uncertainty and of risk perspectives, the volumessi(t)andli(t)held by each sector cannot be considered stable with respect to time and may decrease or increase. For example, depending on the crisis periods, a sector may decide not to invest on instruments and to buy goods as gold and silver. At time t, we denote the amount of instrument j held as an asset in sector i’s portfolio byxij(t)and the amount of instrument j held as a liability in sector i’s portfolio byyij(t). The assets and liabilities in all the sectors are grouped into the matricesx(t)=x1(t)…xi(t)…xn(t)=x11(t)…x1j(t)…x1n(t)……………xi1(t)…xij(t)…xin(t)……………xm1(t)…xmj(t)…xmn(t)andy(t)=y1(t)…yi(t)…yn(t)=y11(t)…y1j(t)…y1n(t)……………yi1(t)…yij(t)…yin(t)……………ym1(t)…ymj(t)…ymn(t).We denote the price of instrument j held as an asset at time t byrj(t)and the price of instrument j held as a liability at time t by(1+hj(t))rj(t), wherehjis a nonnegative function defined into[0,T]and belonging toL∞([0,T],R)={f:[0,T]→Rmeasurable:∃c⩾0suchthat|f(t)|⩽c,a.e.in[0,T]}endowed with the norm‖f(t)‖L∞([0,T],R)=inf{c⩾0:|f(t)|⩽c,a.e.in[0,T]}. We introduce the termhj(t)because the prices of liabilities are generally greater than or equal to the prices of assets in order to describe, in a more realistic way, the behavior of the markets for which the liabilities are more expensive than the assets. In such a way, this paper appears as an improvement in various directions of the previous ones (Daniele, 2003a, 2003b, 2005, 2006, 2010 & Daniele et al., 2005). We group the instrument prices held as an asset into the vectorr(t)=[r1(t),r2(t),…,ri(t),…,rn(t)]Tand the instrument prices held as a liability into the vector(1+h(t))r(t)=[(1+h1(t))r1(t),(1+h2(t))r2(t),…,(1+hi(t))ri(t),…,(1+hn(t))rn(t)]T. In our problem the prices of each instrument appear as unknown variables. Under the assumption of perfect competition, each sector will behave as if it has no influence on the instrument prices or on the behavior of the other sectors, but on the total amount of the investments and the liabilities of each sector.In order to express the time dependent equilibrium conditions by means of an evolutionary variational inequality, we choose as a functional setting the very general Lebesgue spaceL2([0,T],Rp)=f:[0,T]→Rpmeasurable:∫0T‖f(t)‖p2dt<+∞, with the norm‖f‖L2([0,T],Rp)=∫0T‖f(t)‖p2dt12. Then, the set of feasible assets and liabilities for each sectori=1,…,m, becomesPi=(xi(t),yi(t))∈L2([0,T],R2n):∑j=1nxij(t)=si(t),∑j=1nyij(t)=li(t)a.e.in[0,T],xi(t)⩾0,yi(t)⩾0,a.e.in[0,T]∀i=1,…,m.In such a way the set of all feasible assets and liabilities becomesP=(x(t),y(t))∈L2([0,T],R2mn):∑j=1nxij(t)=si(t),∑j=1nyij(t)=li(t),∀i=1,…,m,a.e.in[0,T],xi(t)⩾0,yi(t)⩾0,∀i=1,…,m,a.e.in[0,T].Now, in order to improve the model of competitive financial equilibrium described in Barbagallo et al. (2012), which represents a significant but still partial approach to the complex problem of financial equilibrium, we consider the possibility of policy interventions in the financial equilibrium conditions and incorporate them in form of taxes and price controls and, mainly, we consider a more complete definition of equilibrium pricesr(t), based on the demand–supply law, imposing that the equilibrium prices vary between floor and ceiling prices and in Section 7 we provide useful suggestions for the recovery of the economy.To this aim, denote the ceiling price associated with instrument j byr¯jand the nonnegative floor price associated with instrument j byr̲j, withr¯j(t)>r̲j(t), a.e. in[0,T]. The floor pricer̲j(t)is determined on the basis of the official interest rate fixed by the central banks, which in turns take into account the consumer price inflation. Then the equilibrium pricesrj∗(t)cannot be less than these floor prices. The ceiling pricer¯j(t)derives from the financial need to control the national debt arising from the amount of public bonds and of the rise in inflation. It is a sign of the difficulty on the recovery of the economy. However it should be not overestimated because it produces an availability of money.In detail, the meaning of the lower and upper bounds is that to each investor a minimal pricer̲jfor the assets held in the instrument j is guaranteed, whereas each investor is requested to pay for the liabilities in any case a minimal price(1+hj)r̲j. Analogously each investor cannot obtain for an asset a price greater thanr¯jand as a liability the price cannot exceed the maximum price(1+hj)r¯j.Denote the given tax rate levied on sector i’s net yield on financial instrument j, asτij. Assume that the tax rates lie in the interval[0,1)and belong toL∞([0,T],R). Therefore, the government in this model has the flexibility of levying a distinct tax rate across both sectors and instruments.Let us group the instrument ceiling pricesr¯jinto the column vectorr¯j(t)=[r¯1(t),…,r¯i(t),…,r¯n(t)]T, the instrument floor pricesr̲jinto the column vectorr̲j(t)=[r̲1(t),…,r̲i(t),…,r̲n(t)]T, and the tax ratesτijinto the matrixτ(t)=τ11(t)…τ1j(t)…τ1n(t)……………τi1(t)…τij(t)…τin(t)……………τm1(t)…τmj(t)…τmn(t).The set of feasible instrument prices becomes:R={r∈L2([0,T],Rn):r̲j(t)⩽rj(t)⩽r¯j(t),j=1,…,n,a.e.in[0,T]},wherer̲andr¯are assumed to belong toL2([0,T],Rn).In order to determine for each sector i the optimal composition of instruments held as assets and as liabilities, we consider, as usual, the influence due to risk-aversion and the process of optimization of each sector in the financial economy, namely the desire to maximize the value of the asset holdings while minimizing the value of liabilities. An example of risk aversion is given by the well-known Markowitz quadratic function based on the variance–covariance matrix denoting the sector’s assessment of the standard deviation of prices for each instrument (see Markowitz, 1952, 1959).In our case, however, the Markowitz utility or other more general ones are considered time-dependent in order to incorporate the adjustment in time which depends on the previous equilibrium states. A way in order to obtain the adjustments is to introduce a memory term as it happens in other deterministic models (see Barbagallo & Di Vincenzo, 2011; Giuffrè & Pia, 2010; Maugeri & Scrimali, 2009). Then, we introduce the utility functionUi(t,xi(t),yi(t),r(t)), for each sector i, defined as followsUi(t,xi(t),yi(t),r(t))=ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))+∑j=1nrj(t)(1-τij(t))[xij(t)-(1+hj(t))yij(t)],where the term-ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))represents a measure of the risk of the financial agent andrj(t)(1-τij(t))[xi(t)-(1+hj(t))yi(t)]represents the value of the difference between the asset holdings and the value of liabilities. We suppose that the sector’s utility functionUi(t,xi(t),yi(t))is defined on[0,T]×Rn×Rn, is measurable in t and is continuous with respect toxiandyi. Moreover we assume that∂ui/∂xijand∂ui/∂yijexist and that they are measurable in t and continuous with respect toxiandyi. Further, we require that∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1,…,n, and a.e. in[0,T]the following growth conditions hold true:(1)|ui(t,x,y)|⩽αi(t)‖x‖‖y‖,∀x,y∈Rn,and(2)∂ui(t,x,y)∂xij⩽βij(t)‖y‖,∂ui(t,x,y)∂yij⩽γij(t)‖x‖,whereαi,βij,γijare non-negative functions ofL∞([0,T],R). Finally, we suppose that the functionui(t,x,y)is concave.We remind that the Markowitz utility function verifies conditions (1) and (2).In order to determine the equilibrium prices, we establish the equilibrium condition which expresses the equilibration of the total assets, the total liabilities and the portion of financial transactions per unitFjemployed to cover the expenses of the financial institutions including possible dividends and manager bonus, as in Barbagallo et al. (2012). Hence, the equilibrium condition for the pricerjof instrument j is the following:(3)∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)⩾0ifrj∗(t)=r̲j(t)=0ifr̲j(t)<rj∗(t)<r¯j(t)⩽0ifrj∗(t)=r¯j(t)where(x∗,y∗,r∗)is the equilibrium solution for the investments as assets and as liabilities and for the prices.In other words, the prices are determined taking into account the amount of the supply, the demand of an instrument and the chargesFj, namely if there is an actual supply excess of an instrument as assets and of the chargesFjin the economy, then its price must be the floor price. If the price of an instrument is positive, but not at the ceiling, then the market of that instrument must clear. Finally, if there is an actual demand excess of an instrument as liabilities and of the chargesFjin the economy, then the price must be at the ceiling.Now, we can give different but equivalent equilibrium conditions, each of which is useful to illustrate particular features of the equilibrium.Definition 2.1A vector of sector assets, liabilities and instrument prices(x∗(t),y∗(t),r∗(t))∈P×Ris an equilibrium of the dynamic financial model if and only if∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1,…,n, and a.e. in[0,T], it satisfies the system of inequalities(4)-∂ui(t,x∗,y∗)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)-μi(1)∗(t)⩾0,(5)-∂ui(t,x∗,y∗)∂yij+(1-τij(t))(1+hj(t))rj∗(t)-μi(2)∗(t)⩾0,and equalities(6)xij∗(t)-∂ui(t,x∗,y∗)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)-μi(1)∗(t)=0,(7)yij∗(t)-∂ui(t,x∗,y∗)∂xij+(1-τij(t))(1+hj(t))rj∗(t)-μi(2)∗(t)=0,whereμi(1)∗(t),μi(2)∗(t)∈L2([0,T],R)are Lagrange multipliers, and verifies conditions (3) a.e. in[0,T].Let us explain the meaning of the above conditions. To each financial volumessiandliheld by sector i, we associate the functionsμi(1)∗(t),μi(2)∗(t), related, respectively, to the assets and to the liabilities and which represent the “equilibrium disutilities” per unit of the sector i. Then, (4) and (6) mean that the financial volume invested in instrument j as assetsxij∗is greater than or equal to zero if the j-th component-∂ui(t,x∗,y∗)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)of the disutility is equal toμi(1)∗(t), whereas if-∂ui(t,x∗,y∗)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)>μi(1)∗(t), thenxij∗(t)=0. The same occurs for the liabilities and the meaning of (3) is already illustrated.The functionsμi(1)∗(t)andμi(2)∗(t)are Lagrange multipliers associated a.e. in[0,T]with the constraints∑j=1nxij(t)-si(t)=0and∑j=1nyij(t)-li(t)=0, respectively. They are unknown a priori, but this fact has no influence because we will prove in the following theorem that Definition 2.1 is equivalent to a variational inequality in whichμi(1)∗(t)andμi(2)∗(t)do not appear.Theorem 2.1A vector(x∗,y∗,r∗)∈P×Ris a dynamic financial equilibrium if and only if it satisfies the following variational inequality:Find(x∗,y∗,r∗)∈P×R:(8)∑i=1m∫0T∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)×xij(t)-xij∗(t)+∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂yij+(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)(1+hj(t))×yij(t)-yij∗(t)dt+∑j=1n∫0T∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)×rj(t)-rj∗(t)dt⩾0,∀(x,y,r)∈P×R.The proof of variational inequality (8) of the governing equilibrium conditions is obtained in a few steps. First of all, we shall prove that equilibrium conditions (4)–(7), for each fixed pricer∗(t)∈Rsatisfying (3), are equivalent to a suitable maximum problem, which, in turn, is equivalent to a first variational inequality, as the next result shows:Theorem 2.2xi∗,yi∗is a solution tomaxPi∫0Tui(t,xi(t),yi(t))+(1-τi(t))r∗(t)×[xi(t)-(1+h(t))yi(t)]dt,∀(xi,yi)∈Pi,if and only if it is a solution to the variational inequality(9)∫0T∑j=1n-∂ui(t,xi∗(t),yi∗(t))∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)×[xij(t)-xij∗(t)]dt+∫0T∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂yij+(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)(1+hj(t))×[yij(t)-yij∗(t)]dt⩾0,∀(xi,yi)∈Pi,for a givenr∗∈Rsatisfying conditions(3).Then, for each fixed(x∗,y∗)∈Psatisfying conditions (4)–(7), we show a variational characterization of the equilibrium condition (3), related to the instrument prices, namely:Theorem 2.3Conditions(3)are equivalent to the variational inequality(10)∑j=1n∫0T∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)×rj(t)-rj∗(t)dt⩾0,∀r∈R,for a given(x∗,y∗)∈Psatisfying conditions(4)–(7).Then(x∗,y∗,r∗)∈P×Ris a dynamic financial equilibrium if and only both variational inequalities (9) and (10) are satisfied and, hence, we obtain Theorem 2.1.The proof of the above results is based on delicate tools of Nonlinear Analysis regarding the infinite dimensional duality theory. For this reason, in the next section we recall some aspects of this theory.Remark 2.1We would like to explicitly remark that our definition of equilibrium conditions (Definition 2.1) is equivalent to the equilibrium definition given by a vector(x∗,y∗,r∗)∈P×RsatisfyingmaxPi∫0T{ui(t,xi(t),yi(t))+(1-τi(t))r∗(t)×[xi(t)-(1+h(t))yi(t)]}dt,∀(xi,yi)∈Pi,and∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)⩾0ifrj∗(t)=r̲j(t)=0ifr̲j(t)<rj∗(t)<r¯j(t)⩽0ifrj∗(t)=r¯j(t).We prefer to use Definition 2.1, since it is expressed in terms of equilibrium disutilities.This section is devoted to present the infinite dimensional Lagrange duality which represents an important and very recent achievement (see Daniele & Giuffrè, 2007; Daniele, Giuffrè, Idone, & Maugeri, 2007; Daniele, Giuffré, & Maugeri, 2009; Maugeri & Raciti, 2010).First, we recall the definition of the tangent cone. If X denote a real normed space and C is a subset of X, given an elementx∈X, the set:TC(x)=h∈X:h=limn→∞λn(xn-x),λn∈R,λn>0,∀n∈N,xn∈C∀n∈N,limn→∞xn=xis called the tangent cone to C at x (see Jahn, 1996).Now, let us present the new duality principles for a convex optimization problem. Let X be a real normed space and S a nonempty convex subset of X; let(Y,‖·‖)be a real normed space partially ordered by a convex cone C, withC∗={λ∈Y∗:〈λ,y〉⩾0∀y∈C}the dual cone ofC,Y∗topological dual of Y, and let(Z,‖·‖Z)be a real normed space with topological dualZ∗. Let us set-C=-x∈Y:x∈C. Letf:S→Randg:S→Ybe two convex functions and leth:S→Zbe an affine-linear function.Let us consider the problem(11)minx∈Kf(x)whereK={x∈S:g(x)∈-C,h(x)=θZ}and the dual problem(12)maxλ∈C∗μ∈Z∗infx∈S{f(x)+〈λ,g(x)〉+〈μ,h(x)〉}.Remember thatλandμare the so-called Lagrange multipliers, associated to the sign constraints and to equality constraints, respectively. They play a fundamental role to better understand the behavior of the financial equilibrium. Moreover, as it is well-known, it always results:(13)minx∈Kf(x)⩾maxλ∈C∗μ∈Z∗infx∈S{f(x)+〈λ,g(x)〉+〈μ,h(x)〉},and, if problem (11) is solvable and in (13) the equality holds, we say that the strong duality between primal problem (11) and dual problem (12) holds. When we have the strong duality, we may consider the so-called “shadow market”, namely the dual Lagrange problem associated to the primal problem (see formula (49)).In order to obtain the strong duality, it needs that delicate conditions, called “constraints qualification conditions”, hold. In the infinite dimensional settings the next assumption, the so-called Assumption S, results to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the strong duality (see Daniele & Giuffrè, 2007; Daniele et al., 2007, 2009; Maugeri & Raciti, 2010).Definition of Assumption SWe shall say that Assumption S is fulfilled at a pointx0∈Kif it results(14)TM∼(0,θY,θZ)∩(]-∞,0[×{θY}×{θZ})=∅,whereM∼={(f(x)-f(x0)+α,g(x)+y,h(x)):x∈S⧹K,α⩾0,y∈C}.The following theorem holds (see Theorem 1.1 in Daniele et al. (2009) for the proof):Theorem 3.1Under the above assumptions onf,g,hand C, if problem(11)is solvable and Assumption S is fulfilled at the extremal solutionx0∈K, then also problem(12)is solvable, the extreme values of both problems are equal, namely, if(x0,λ∗,μ∗)∈K×C∗×Z∗is the optimal point of problem(12),(15)f(x0)=minx∈Kf(x)=f(x0)+〈λ∗,g(x0)〉+〈μ∗,h(x0)〉=maxλ∈C∗μ∈Z∗infx∈S{f(x)+〈λ,g(x)〉+〈μ,h(x)〉}and, it results:〈λ∗,g(x0)〉=0.Let us recall that the following one is the so-called Lagrange functional(16)L(x,λ,μ)=f(x)+〈λ,g(x)〉+〈μ,h(x)〉,∀x∈S,∀λ∈C∗,∀μ∈Z∗.Using the Lagrange functional, (15) may be rewrittenf(x0)=minx∈Kf(x)=L(x0,λ∗,μ∗)=maxλ∈C∗μ∈Z∗infx∈SL(x,λ,μ)By means of Theorem 3.1, it is possible to show the usual relationship between a saddle point of the Lagrange functional and the solution of the constraint optimization problem (11) (see Theorem 5 in Daniele et al. (2007) for the proof).Theorem 3.2Let us assume that the assumptions ofTheorem 3.1are satisfied. Thenx0∈Kis a minimal solution to problem(11)if and only if there existλ¯∈C∗andμ¯∈Z∗such that(x0,λ¯,μ¯)is a saddle point of the Lagrange functional(16), namelyL(x0,λ,μ)⩽L(x0,λ∗,μ∗)⩽L(x,λ∗,μ∗),∀x∈S,λ∈C∗,μ∈Z∗and, moreover, it results that(17)〈λ∗,g(x0)〉=0.The proof of Theorem 2.1 is obtained in several steps. The first one is the equivalence between a suitable maximum problem and a first variational inequality.Theorem 4.1xi∗,yi∗is a solution to(18)maxPi∫0Tui(t,xi(t),yi(t))+(1-τi(t))r∗(t)×[xi(t)-(1+h(t))yi(t)]dt,∀(xi,yi)∈Pi,if and only if it is a solution to the variational inequality(19)∫0T∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)×[xij(t)-xij∗(t)]dt+∫0T∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂yij+(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)(1+hj(t))×yij(t)-yij∗(t)dt⩾0,∀(xi,yi)∈Pi,for a givenr∗∈Rsatisfying conditions(3).The proof is based on the results of Barbagallo et al. (2012) and Stampacchia (1969) and, hence, we refer the reader to the proof of Theorem 5 in Barbagallo et al. (2012).Now, we show the equivalence between problem (19) and the equilibrium conditions (4)–(7), considering each sector i. To this aim it is necessary to give a preliminary lemma.Lemma 4.1Let(xi∗,yi∗)∈Pibe a solution of variational inequality(19)and letr∗∈Rsatisfy conditions(3). Let us set, a.e. in[0,T],νia(t)=min-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t):j=1,2,…,n,νil(t)=min-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij+(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)(1+hj(t)):j=1,2,…,n,and, forj=1,2,…,n,Xj1=t∈[0,T]:-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)=νia(t),Xj2=t∈[0,T]:-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)>νia(t),Yj1=t∈[0,T]:-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij+(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)(1+hj(t))=νil(t),Yj2=t∈[0,T]:-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij+(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)(1+hj(t))>νil(t),then,(20)t∈Xj1⇒xij∗(t)⩾0,(21)t∈Xj2⇒xij∗(t)=0.and(22)t∈Yj1⇒yij∗(t)⩾0,(23)t∈Yj2⇒yij∗(t)=0.Vice versa, if there exist two functionsνia,νil∈L2([0,T],R), fori=1,2,…,msuch that conditions(20)–(23)hold, for a givenr∗∈Rsatisfying conditions(3), thenxi∗,yi∗∈Piis a solution to variational inequality(19).The proof is perfectly analogous to that of Lemma 1 in Barbagallo et al. (2012), then, for the sake of brevity, we do not report it.□Before proving that Problem (19) verifies Assumption S, let us show how a variational inequality problem can be rewritten as an optimization problem. To this end let us set,∀(xi,yi)∈Pi,f(xi,yi)=∫0T∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)×xij(t)-xij∗(t)dt+∫0T∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂yij+(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)(1+hj(t))yij(t)-yij∗(t)dt,withxi∗,yi∗∈Pisolution to (19) and let us remark that, sincef(xi,yi)⩾0,∀(xi,yi)∈Pi, andf(xi∗,yi∗)=0,minPif(xi,yi)=fxi∗,yi∗=0.Hence, the solution to a variational inequality is also solution to a minimal problem. SettingS=X=Y=L2([0,T],R2n),Z=L2([0,T],R2), withg(xi,yi)=(-xi,-yi),h(xi,yi)=∑j=1nxij(t)-si(t),∑j=1nyij(t)-li(t),i=1,…,n, the Lagrange functional, in this case, is(24)Lxi,yi,λi(1),λi(2),μi(1),μi(2)=f(xi,yi)-∫0T∑j=1nλij(1)(t)xij(t)dt-∫0T∑j=1nλij(2)(t)yij(t)dt-∫0Tμi(1)(t)∑j=1nxij(t)-si(t)dt-∫0Tμi(2)(t)∑j=1nyij(t)-li(t)dt,whereλi(1),λi(2)∈L2([0,T],R+n),μi(1),μi(2)∈L2([0,T],R)and(xi,yi)∈L2([0,T],R2n).In these settings the assumptions off,g,hand C are verified, then, taking into account Lemma 4.1 and proceeding analogously as in the proof of Theorem 6 in Barbagallo et al. (2012), the following result holds.Theorem 4.2Problem (19)verifies Assumption S at a solutionxi∗,yi∗to variational inequality(19).Finally, we are able to prove the following equivalence.Theorem 4.3xi∗,yi∗∈Piis a solution to problem(19)if and only if there existλij(1)∗,λij(2)∗∈L2([0,T],R+),μi(1)∗,μi(2)∗∈L2([0,T],R)such that it results to be:(25)-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)-λij(1)∗(t)-μi(1)∗(t)=0,a.e.in[0,T];(26)-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂yij+(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)(1+hj(t))-λij(2)∗(t)-μi(2)∗(t)=0,a.e.in[0,T],and(27)λij(1)∗(t)xij∗(t)=0,λij(2)∗(t)yij∗(t)=0,a.e.in[0,T],(28)μi(1)∗(t)∑j=1nxij∗(t)-si(t)=0,μi(2)∗(t)∑j=1nyij∗(t)-li(t)=0,a.e.in[0,T]for a givenr∗∈Rsatisfying conditions(3).Let us assume there existsxi∗,yi∗∈Pisolution to (19). Then, from Theorem 3.2, applied to the Lagrange functional (24), it follows that there existλi(1)∗(t)⩾0,λi(2)∗(t)⩾0,μi(1)∗(t),μi(2)∗(t), a.e. in[0,T], such that(xi∗(t),yi∗(t),λi(1)∗(t),λi(2)∗(t),μi(1)∗(t),μi(2)∗(t))is a saddle point of the Lagrange functional, that is,∀λi(1),λi(2)∈L2[0,T],R+n,∀μi(1),μi(2)∈L2([0,T],R),Lxi∗,yi∗,λi(1),λi(2),μi(1),μi(2)⩽Lxi∗,yi∗,λi(1)∗,λi(2)∗,μi(1)∗,μi(2)∗=0(29)⩽Lxi,yi,λi(1)∗,λi(2)∗,μi(1)∗,μi(2)∗,and(30)λij(1)∗(t)xij∗(t)=0,λij(2)∗(t)yij∗(t)=0,a.e.in[0,T],(31)μi(1)∗(t)∑j=1nxij∗(t)-si(t)=0,μi(2)∗(t)∑j=1nyij∗(t)-li(t)=0,a.e.in[0,T].Conditions (27) and (28) are, then, achieved.In order to obtain conditions (25) and (26), let us consider the right hand side of (29), namelyLxi,yi,λi(1)∗,λi(2)∗,μi(1)∗,μi(2)∗⩾0=Lxi∗,yi∗,λi(1)∗,λi(2)∗,μi(1)∗,μi(2)∗,∀(xi,yi)∈L2([0,T],R2n).It follows, taking into account (30) and (31), that:f(xi,yi)-∫0T∑j=1nλij(1)∗(t)xij(t)-xij∗(t)dt-∫0T∑j=1nλij(2)∗(t)yij(t)-yij∗(t)dt-∫0Tμi(1)∗(t)∑j=1nxij(t)-si(t)dt-∫0Tμi(2)∗(t)∑j=1nyij(t)-li(t)dt=∫0T∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)-λij(1)∗(t)-μi(1)∗(t)×xij(t)-xij∗(t)dt+∫0T∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂yij+(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)(1+hj(t))-λij(2)∗(t)-μi(2)∗(t)×yij(t)-yij∗(t)dt⩾0,∀(xi,yi)∈L2([0,T],R2n).Settingyij(t)=yij∗(t), a.e. in[0,T]andxih(t)=xih∗(t)forh≠jandxij(t)=xij∗(t)±εij(t), a.e. in[0,T], whereε∈L2([0,T],Rmn), it results to be∫0T-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)-λij(1)∗(t)-μi(1)∗(t)×εij(t)dt=0,∀εij∈L2([0,T],R),that implies condition (25). Analogously, we can obtain condition (26).Vice versa, let us suppose that there exist(x∗,y∗)∈P,λij(1)∗,λij(2)∗∈L2([0,T],R+)andμi(1)∗,μi(2)∗∈L2([0,T],R)that satisfy conditions (25)–(28). By using (25), we have(32)-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)-μi(1)∗(t)=λij(1)∗(t),a.e.in[0,T],and multiplying byxij∗(t), a.e. in[0,T], and taking into account (27), it results(33)-∂ui(t,xi∗(t),yi∗(t))∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)xij∗(t)-μi(1)∗(t)xij∗(t)=0,a.e.in[0,T].Moreover, multipling (32) byxij(t), a.e. in[0,T], and summing up with (33), we obtain(34)-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)-μi(1)∗(t)×xij(t)-xij∗(t)⩾0,a.e.in[0,T].Now, by summing onj=1,…,nand taking into account (28), we get(35)∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)×xij(t)-xij∗(t)⩾0,a.e.in[0,T].Finally, by passing to the integral on[0,T]and summing oni=1,…,m, we obtain∑i=1m∫0T∑j=1n-∂uit,xi∗(t),yi∗(t)∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)×xij(t)-xij∗(t)dt⩾0.Analogously, we can proceed with condition (26). Then, it results that(x∗,y∗)is a solution to problem (19). Hence, the proof is complete. □Conditions (25) and (26) allow us to study, in an operative way, the behavior of the market.Now we can prove the following characterization of the equilibrium condition related to the instrument prices.Theorem 4.4Conditions(3)are equivalent to the variational inequality(36)∑j=1n∫0T∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)×rj(t)-rj∗(t)dt⩾0,∀r∈Rfor a given(x∗,y∗)∈Psatisfying conditions(4)–(7).Supposer∗∈Rsatisfies conditions (3) and defineE-=t∈[0,T]:rj∗(t)=r̲j(t),E0=t∈[0,T]:r̲j(t)<rj∗(t)<r¯j(t),E+=t∈[0,T]:rj∗(t)=r¯j(t).From conditions (3) it follows that∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)⩾0,inE-,∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)=0,inE0,∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)⩽0,inE+,then, for allr∈L2[0,T],R+n, it results to be∫0T∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)×rj(t)-rj∗(t)dt=∫E-∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)×[rj(t)-r̲j(t)]dt+∫E+∑i=1m(1-τij(t))×xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)×[rj(t)-r¯j(t)]dt⩾0that is (36).The reverse part can be obtained following the same technique of Theorem 8 in Barbagallo et al. (2012).□We proved that(x∗,y∗)∈Psatisfies variational inequality (19) for each fixedr∗∈Rsatisfying conditions (3) andr∗∈Rsatisfies variational inequality (36) for each fixed(x∗,y∗)∈Psatisfying conditions (4)–(7). Then, overall,(x∗,y∗,r∗)satisfies the sum of two variational inequalites, namely variational inequality (8), and vice versa. Thus, Theorem 2.1 is completely proved.In the following, some theorems for the existence and the continuity of solutions to the dynamic financial equilibrium problem will be recalled.First of all, we remind some definitions (see Maugeri & Raciti, 2009). Let X be a reflexive Banach space and letKbe a subset of X andX∗be the dual space of X.Definition 5.1A mappingA:K→X∗is pseudomonotone in the sense of Brezis (B-pseudomonotone) iff1.For each sequenceunweakly converging to u (in shortun⇀u) inKand such thatlimsupn〈Aun,un-v〉⩽0it results that:liminfn〈Aun,un-v〉⩾〈Au,u-v〉,∀v∈K.For eachv∈Kthe functionu↦〈Au,u-v〉is lower bounded on the bounded subset ofK.A mappingA:K→X∗is hemicontinuous in the sense of Fan (F-hemicontinuous) iff for allv∈Kthe functionu↦〈Au,u-v〉is weakly lower semicontinuous onK.Now, we recall the following hemicontinuity definition, which will be used together with some kinds of monotonicity assumptions.Definition 5.3A mappingA:K→X∗is lower hemicontinuous along line segments, iff the functionξ↦〈Aξ,u-v〉is lower semicontinuous for allu,v∈Kon the line segments[u,v].The mapA:K→X∗is said to be pseudomonotone in the sense of Karamardian (K-pseudomonotone) iff for allu,v∈K〈Av,u-v〉⩾0⇒〈Au,u-v〉⩾0.Then we recall the following existence theorems (see Maugeri & Raciti, 2009). The first one does not require any kind of monotonicity assumptions.Theorem 5.1LetK⊂Xbe a nonempty closed convex bounded set and letA:K⊂E→X∗be B-pseudomonotone or F-hemicontinuous. Then the variational inequality(37)〈Au,v-u〉⩾0∀v∈Kadmits a solution.LetK⊂Xbe a closed convex bounded set and letA:K→X∗be a K-pseudomonotone map which is lower hemicontinuous along line segments. Then variational inequality(37)admits solutions.We can apply such theorems to our model, setting:v=(xij)i=1,…,mj=1,…,n,(yij)i=1,…,mj=1,…,n,(rj)j=1,…,n;A:L2([0,T],R2mn+n)→L2([0,T],R2mn+n),A(v)=-∂ui(x,y)∂xij-(1-τij)rji=1,…,mj=1,…,n,-∂ui(x,y)∂yij+(1-τij)(1+hj)rji=1,…,mj=1,…,n,∑i=1m(1-τij)(xij-(1+hj)yij)j=1,…,n;K=P×R=v∈L2([0,T],R2mn+n):xi(t)⩾0,yi(t)⩾0,a.e.in[0,T],∑j=1nxij(t)=si(t),∑j=1nyij(t)=li(t)a.e.in[0,T],∀i=1,…,m,r̲j(t)⩽rj(t)⩽r¯j(t),a.e.in[0,T],∀j=1,…,n.Hence, evolutionary variational inequality (8) becomes (37) and we can apply Theorems 5.1 and 5.2, assuming that A is B-pseudomonotone or K-hemicontinuous, or assuming that A is K-pseudomonotone, lower hemicontinuous along line segments and noting thatKis nonempty closed convex and bounded.Moreover, we recall that conditions (2) are sufficient to guarantee that the operator A is lower hemicontinuous along line segments (see Fucik & Kufner, 1980).In this section we study the infinite dimensional duality for the general financial equilibrium problem expressed by variational inequality (8), whereas in Theorem 4.3 we use the duality theory for the reduced variational inequality involving variables(x,y)for each fixed pricer∗. Actually, in this new variational inequality we are concerned with all the variables(x,y,r).The first step is to introduce the Lagrange functional for this general model. To this end, as usual, let us setf(x,y,r)=∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n-∂ui(t,x∗(t),y∗(t))∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)×xij(t)-xij∗(t)+∑i=1m∑j=1n-∂ui(t,x∗(t),y∗(t))∂yij+(1-τij(t))(1+hj(t))rj∗(t)×yij(t)-yij∗(t)+∑j=1n∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)×rj(t)-rj∗(t)dt.Then the Lagrange functional is(38)L(x,y,r,λ(1),λ(2),μ(1),μ(2),ρ(1),ρ(2))=f(x,y,r)-∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0Tλij(1)(t)xij(t)dt-∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0Tλij(2)yij(t)dt-∑i=1m∫0Tμi(1)(t)∑j=1nxij(t)-si(t)dt-∑i=1m∫0Tμi(2)(t)∑j=1nyij(t)-li(t)dt+∑j=1n∫0Tρj(1)(t)(r̲j(t)-rj(t))dt+∑j=1n∫0Tρj(2)(t)(rj(t)-r¯j(t))dt,where(x,y,r)∈L2([0,T],R2mn+n),λ(1),λ(2)∈L2[0,T],R+mn,μ(1),μ(2)∈L2([0,T],Rm),ρ(1),ρ(2)∈L2[0,T],R+n.Remember thatλ(1),λ(2),ρ(1),ρ(2)are the Lagrange multipliers associated, a.e. in[0,T], to the sign constraintsxi(t)⩾0,yi(t)⩾0,rj(t)-r̲j(t)⩾0,r¯j(t)-rj(t)⩾0, respectively. The functionsμ(1)(t)andμ(2)(t)are the Lagrange multipliers associated, a.e. in[0,T], to the equality constraints∑j=1nxij(t)-si(t)=0and∑j=1nyij(t)-li(t)=0, respectively.Now we show the following theorem.Theorem 6.1Let(x∗,y∗,r∗)∈P×Rbe a solution to variational inequality(8)and let us consider the associated Lagrange functional(38). Then, the strong duality holds and there existλ(1)∗,λ(2)∗∈L2[0,T],R+mn,μ(1)∗,μ(2)∗∈L2([0,T],Rm),ρ(1)∗,ρ(2)∗∈L2[0,T],R+nsuch that(x∗,y∗,r∗,λ(1)∗,λ(2)∗,μ(1)∗,μ(2)∗,ρ(1)∗,ρ(2)∗)is a saddle point of the Lagrange functional, namely(39)L(x∗,y∗,r∗,λ(1),λ(2),μ(1),μ(2),ρ(1),ρ(2))⩽L(x∗,y∗,r∗,λ(1)∗,λ(2)∗,μ(1)∗,μ(2)∗,ρ(1)∗,ρ(2)∗)=0⩽L(x,y,r,λ(1)∗,λ(2)∗,μ(1)∗,μ(2)∗,ρ(1)∗,ρ(2)∗)∀(x,y,r)∈L2([0,T],R2mn+n),∀λ(1),λ(2)∈L2([0,T],R+mn),∀μ(1),μ(2)∈L2([0,T],Rm),∀ρ(1),ρ(2)∈L2[0,T],R+nand, a.e. in[0,T],(40)-∂ui(t,x∗(t),y∗(t))∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)-λij(1)∗(t)-μi(1)∗(t)=0,∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1…,n;-∂ui(t,x∗(t),y∗(t))∂yij+(1-τij(t))(1+hj(t))rj∗(t)-λij(2)∗(t)-μi(2)∗(t)=0,∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1…,n;∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)+ρj(2)∗(t)=ρj(1)∗(t),∀j=1,…,n;(41)λij(1)∗(t)xij∗(t)=0,λij(2)∗(t)yij∗(t)=0,∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1,…,n(42)μi(1)∗(t)∑j=1nxij∗(t)-si(t)=0,μi(2)∗(t)∑j=1nyij∗(t)-li(t)=0,∀i=1,…,m(43)ρj(1)∗(t)r̲j(t)-rj∗(t)=0,ρj(2)∗(t)rj∗(t)-r¯j(t)=0,∀j=1,…,n.A first step, in order to achieve the result, is to prove that Assumption S is satisfied at the point(x∗,y∗,r∗). Taking into account thatf(x∗,y∗,r∗)=0, settingX=L2([0,T],R2nm+n),Y=L2([0,T],Rnm),Z=L2([0,T],Rm), it resultsM∼=f(x,y,r)+α,-x+w,-y+z,r-r¯+u,r̲-r+v,∑j=1nxij-si,∑j=1nyij-li:(x,y,r)∈X⧹(P×R),α⩾0,w,z∈Y,w,z⩾0,u,v∈L2([0,T],Rn),u⩾0,w⩾0.Hence, we have to show that, if(xn,yn,rn)is a sequence inX⧹(P×R)such thatl=limn→∞λn(f(xn,yn,rn)+αn),θY=limn→∞λn(-xn+wn),θY=limn→∞λn(-yn+zn),θZ=limn→∞λn∑j=1nxijn-si,θZ=limn→∞λn∑j=1nyijn-li,θL2([0,T],Rn)=limn→∞λn(r̲-rn+un),θL2([0,T],Rn)=limn→∞λn(rn-r¯+vn)withαn⩾0,λn>0,wn,zn∈Y,wn⩾0,zn⩾0,un,vn∈L2([0,T],Rn),un⩾0,wn⩾0,limn→∞(f(xn,yn,rn)+αn)=0,limn→∞(-xn+wn)=θY,limn→∞(-yn+zn)=θY,limn→∞∑j=1nxijn-si=θZ,limn→∞∑j=1nyijn-li=θZ,(44)limn→∞(r̲-rn+un)=θL2([0,T],Rn),limn→∞(rn-r¯+vn)=θL2([0,T],Rn),then it has to resultl⩾0.As in the proof of Theorem 4.2 (see Theorem 6 in Barbagallo et al. (2012)), it is possible to prove that the first two terms inf(xn,yn,rn)=∫0T∑i=1m∑j=1n-∂ui(t,x∗(t),y∗(t))∂xij-(1-τij(t))rj∗(t)×xijn(t)-xij∗(t)+∑i=1m∑j=1n-∂ui(t,x∗(t),y∗(t))∂yij+(1-τij(t))(1+hj(t))rj∗(t)×yijn(t)-yij∗(t)+∑j=1n∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)×rjn(t)-rj∗(t)dt.have non-negative limits. So it remains to prove that, forj=1,…,nlimn→∞λn∫0T∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hij(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)rjn(t)-rj∗(t)dt⩾0.To this end, let us remark that, if we set, forj=1,2,…,n,E-j=t∈[0,T]:rj∗(t)=r̲j(t),E0j=t∈[0,T]:r̲j(t)<rj∗(t)<r¯j(t),E+j=t∈[0,T]:rj∗(t)=r¯j(t),then, taking into account conditions (3), we get∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)⩾0,a.e.inE-j,∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)=0,a.e.inE0j,∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)⩽0,a.e.inE+j.Then we obtainλn∫0T∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)rjn(t)-rj∗(t)dt=λn∫Ej-∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)rjn(t)-r̲j(t)dt+λn∫Ej0∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)rjn(t)-rj∗(t)dt+λn∫Ej+∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)rjn(t)-r¯j(t)dt=∫Ej-∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)λn(rjn(t)-r̲j(t)-ujn(t))︸→0becauseof(44)dt+∫Ej-∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)︸⩾0λnujn(t)︸⩾0dt+λn∫Ej0∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)︸=0rjn(t)-rj∗(t)dt+∫Ej+∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)λn(rjn(t)-r¯j(t)+vjn(t))︸→0becauseof(44)dt+∫Ej+∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)︸⩽0λn(-vjn(t))︸⩽0dt⩾0because of (36).Hence Assumption S is satisfied.Proceeding analogously as in the proof of Theorem 11 in Barbagallo et al. (2012), we obtain our thesis. □It is worth remarking formula (40), because we will call it Deficit Formula and we will study it in Section 7.Let us now call Balance Law the following one∑i=1mli(t)=∑i=1msi(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1nτij(t)xij∗(t)-yij∗(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1n(1-τij(t))hj(t)yij∗(t)+∑j=1nFj(t)-∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)+∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)We can prove the following theorem.Theorem 6.2Let(x∗,y∗,r∗)∈P×Rbe the dynamic equilibrium solution to variational inequality(8), then the Balance Law(45)∑i=1mli(t)=∑i=1msi(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1nτij(t)xij∗(t)-yij∗(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1n(1-τij(t))hj(t)yij∗(t)+∑j=1nFj(t)-∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)+∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)is verified.Taking into account that the equilibrium solution verifies Deficit Formula, namely∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)-ρj(1)∗(t)+ρj(2)∗(t)=0,j=1,…,n,a.e.in[0,T],summing up with respect to j, we obtain∑i=1m∑j=1n(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1n(1-τij(t))yij∗(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1n(1-τij(t))hj(t)yij∗(t)+∑j=1nFj(t)-∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)+∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)=0.Since∑j=1nxij∗(t)=si(t)and∑j=1nyij∗(t)=li(t), we get∑i=1msi(t)-∑i=1mli(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1nτij(t)xij∗(t)-yij∗(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1n(1-τij(t))hj(t)yij∗(t)+∑j=1nFj(t)-∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)+∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)=0and hence the Balance Law.Assuming that the taxesτij(t),i=1,…,m,j=1,…,nhave a common valueθ(t), and the incrementshj(t),j=1,…,n, have a common valuei(t), otherwise we can consider the average values (see Remark 7.1), we get the significant Liability Formula∑i=1mli(t)=(1-θ(t))∑i=1msi(t)+∑j=1nFj(t)-∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)+∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)(1-θ(t))(1+i(t)).□Let us show how from Liability Formula we get the following indexE(t), called“Evaluation Index”, that is very useful for the rating procedure and will be studied in Section 7:E(t)=∑i=1mli(t)∑i=1ms̃i(t)+∑j=1nF∼j(t),where we sets̃i(t)=si(t)1+i(t),F∼j(t)=Fj(t)1+i(t)-θ(t)-θ(t)i(t).From Liability Formula we obtain(46)E(t)=1-∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)(1-θ(t))(1+i(t))∑i=1ms̃i(t)+∑j=1nF∼j(t)+∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)(1-θ(t))(1+i(t))∑i=1ms̃i(t)+∑j=1nF∼j(t)We study the relevant consequences of the financial equilibrium found in Section 6, namely the Deficit Formula, a general Balance Law and the Liability Formula, which could be of great importance for the economic development (for what concerns the theory of equilibrium problems evolving in time see, for instance, (Barbagallo, 2009; Barbagallo & Maugeri, 2011; Cojocaru, Daniele, & Nagurney, 2006; Giuffrè, Idone, & Pia, 2008; Giuffrè & Pia, 2009)).Then, taking into account the previous results, we provide some suggestions for the achievement of the world financial equilibrium and for finding the necessary way to follow in order to reach an improvement of the economy.Let us focus our attention on Deficit Formula, Balance Law and Liability Formula, that, for reader’s convenience, we now recall:(i)Deficit Formula(47)∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)+ρj(2)∗(t)=ρj(1)∗(t),∀j=1,…,n,whereρj(1)∗(t)andρj(2)∗(t)are the Lagrange multipliers associated to the price bounds:(48)ρj(1)∗(t)(r̲j(t)-rj∗(t))=0,ρj(2)∗(t)rj∗(t)-r¯j(t)=0,∀j=1,…,n.The meaning ofρj(1)∗(t)is that it represents the deficit per unit whereasρj(2)∗(t)is the positive surplus per unit;Balance Law∑i=1mli(t)=∑i=1msi(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1nτij(t)xij∗(t)-yij∗(t)-∑i=1m∑j=1n(1-τij(t))hj(t)yij∗(t)+∑j=1nFj(t)-∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)+∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t);Liability Formula∑i=1mli(t)=(1-θ(t))∑i=1msi(t)+∑j=1nFj(t)-∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)+∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)(1-θ(t))(1+i(t)),whereθ(t)andi(t)are the common value ofτij(t)andhj(t)or the average values, respectively.First we remark that the financial problem can be considered from two different perspectives: one from the Point of View of the Sectors which try to maximize the utility and a second point of view, that we can call System Point of View, which regards the whole equilibrium, namely the respect of the previous laws. For example, from the point of view of the sectors,li(t), fori=1,…,m, are liabilities, whereas for the economic system they are investments and, hence, the Liability Formula, from the system point of view, can be called “Investments Formula”. The system point of view coincides with the dual Lagrange problem (the so-called “shadow market”) in whichρj(1)(t)andρj(2)(t)are the dual multipliers, representing the deficit and the surplus per unit arising from instrument j. Formally, the dual problem is given by:Find(ρ(1)∗,ρ(2)∗)∈L2([0,T],R+2n)such that(49)∑j=1n∫0T(ρj(1)(t)-ρj(1)∗(t))r̲j(t)-rj∗(t)dt+∑j=1n∫0Tρj(2)(t)-ρj(2)∗(t)rj∗(t)-r¯j(t)dt⩽0,∀(ρ(1),ρ(2))∈L2[0,T],R+2n.In fact, taking into account inequality (39), we get-∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0Tλij(1)(t)-λij(1)∗(t)xij∗(t)dt-∑i=1m∑j=1n∫0Tλij(2)-λij(2)∗yij∗(t)dt-∑i=1m∫0Tμi(1)(t)-μi(1)∗(t)∑j=1nxij∗(t)-si(t)dt-∑i=1m∫0Tμi(2)(t)-μi(2)∗(t)∑j=1nyij∗(t)-li(t)dt+∑j=1n∫0Tρj(t)(1)-ρj(1)∗(t)r̲j(t)-rj∗(t)dt+∑j=1n∫0Tρj(2)(t)-ρj(2)∗(t)rj∗(t)-r¯j(t)dt⩽0∀λ(1),λ(2)∈L2[0,T],R+mn,μ(1),μ(2)∈L2([0,T],Rm),ρ(1),ρ(2)∈L2[0,T],R+n.Choosingλ(1)=λ(1)∗,λ(2)=λ(2)∗,μ(1)=μ(1)∗,μ(2)=μ(2)∗,we obtain the dual problem (49).Note that, from the System Point of View, also the expenses of the institutionsFj(t)are supported from the liabilities of the sectors. The information can be synthesized by means of the following propositions.Proposition 7.1When the prices are minimal, namely they coincide with the floor prices, the economy collapses.In fact, considering Lagrange conditions (48), we note that, if the equilibrium prices are minimal, we can have the deficit per unitρj(1)∗(t)>0, while the surplus per unitρj(2)∗(t)=0. Then, from the Liability or Investments Formula, we have the very important consequence that, when the prices are minimal, the amount of the productive investments∑i=1mli(note the different meaning ofliwith respect to the different points of view) decreases of a quantity which depends onρj(1)∗(t). Then the crisis which affects the financial institutions depends on the fact that the amount of the productive investments does not respect the Balance Law (ii) and does not take into account the decrement due toρj(1)∗(t)and the consequent deficit. Of course the problem of which prices can be considered minimal arises. We can assume that the floor prices depend on the key interest rate fixed by the central banks. However, actual equilibrium pricesrj∗(t)are often lower than the key interest rate fixed by the central banks.Proposition 7.2Minimal prices imply the increase in the public debt.As we have seen with regards to Proposition 7.1, there is a strict correlation between the floor prices and the Lagrange multipliersρj(1)(t)as the first formula of (48) shows:ρj(1)∗(t)r̲j(t)-rj∗(t)=0.Then, ifrj∗(t)=r̲j(t),ρj(1)(t)could be positive andρj(2)(t)vanishes. So, by virtue of the Deficit Formula, we get∑i=1m(1-τij(t))xij∗(t)-(1+hj(t))yij∗(t)+Fj(t)=ρj(1)∗(t)and the deficit arisesρj(1)∗(t)r̲j(t)>0,namely, for the financial institutions, the cost of the assets exactly exceeds of the quantityρj(1)∗(t)r̲j(t)the yield of the liabilities and an unexpected deficit appears.In such a way we receive valuable information from the dual financial equilibrium problem, namely we learn the paradoxical consequence that, when the prices are minimal, the investments, i.e.li(t), decrease rather than increase. The economic reason of this is that the investors step back by virtue of the general weakness of the economy.Proposition 7.3Minimal prices produce an economic recession. There is no incentive to the economic efforts.In fact, the amount of the money supply in the markets is considerably reduced, because the investments assets of the sectors have a very low yield. Sectors have no interest in investing the savingxijon investments, because it is more convenient to invest on buying gold, silver or other unproductive goods, or also to address the savings to tax havens, or even putting money under the mattress. To this we must add the restrictive economic policies of the states aiming to control the deficit, which has as a consequence an increase in unemployment and again a decrease in purchasing power and, hence, in savings and in investments.Proposition 7.4Even if it could be shocking, the development of the economy and of the employment results from an increase in the prices, namely the revenue.The increase of the prices of the assets so thatrj∗(t)is greater than the floor pricer̲j(t), but less than the ceiling pricer¯j(t), produces some positive effects. First, as we can see from the Deficit Formula, the Lagrange multipliersρj(1)∗(t),ρj(2)∗(t)must be zero and hence the desired effect of the equilibration of the deficit related to the instrument j appears. The meaning of this equilibration is that when the prices are not minimal and hence the assets receive a suitable yield also the liabilities (which are the investments for the financial institutions) increase, provided that the financial institutions encourage the credit of the investment. This happens because the increase of the yield of the assets is a sign of an active economy in which the purchasing power increases and an economic growth is possible. The case whenrj∗(t)=r¯j(t)deserves a particular attention. In this caseρj(1)∗(t)vanishes andρj(2)∗(t)could be positive. Hence we have a big yield for the assets and also a large amount of liabilities, namely of the investments. However this situation has a serious drawback because it produces a cost increase in the whole economy and, also, a capital inflation besides an increase of the national debt.Remark 7.1The Evaluation IndexWe have already introduced the “Evaluation Index”E(t)=∑i=1mli(t)∑i=1ms̃i(t)+∑j=1nF∼j(t).We may claim that, ifE(t)is greater than or equal to 1 the evaluation of the financial equilibrium is positive, whereas ifE(t)is less than 1 the evaluation of the financial equilibrium is negative.In fact, as already observed in Section 2, it holdsE(t)=1-∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)(1-θ(t))(1+i(t))∑i=1ms̃i(t)+∑j=1nF∼j(t)+∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)(1-θ(t))(1+i(t))∑i=1ms̃i(t)+∑j=1nF∼j(t).IfE(t)<1, it means that∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)<∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)and this implies that the sum of deficits exceeds the sum of surpluses and we find a negative outlook.On the other hand ifE(t)⩾1, then∑j=1nρj(2)∗(t)⩾∑j=1nρj(1)∗(t)and we have already considered the positive effects of this surplus.The example in Section 8 will illustrate the simple use of the Evaluation Index.It is worth mentioning that the Evaluation Index does not depend on the equilibrium prices. This happens because it is fundamental to reach the equilibrium between assets and liabilities and not the level of the price at which it is reached.The Evaluation Index has been fixed assuming that the taxesτij(t),i=1,…,m,j=1,…,nhave a common valueθ(t), and the incrementshj(t),j=1,…,n, have a common valuei(t). However it can also be considered the case whenτij(t),hj(t)are all different, assumingθ(t)andi(t)are the averages ofτij(t)andhj(t), namelyθ(t)=∑i=1m∑j=1nτij(t)mnandi(t)=∑j=1nhj(t)n, respectively. Also in this case the Evaluation Index gives reliable information.Let us analyze a numerical financial example in which we consider as the risk aversion function the one suggested by Markowitz (1952, 1959), which expresses at each instantt∈[0,T]the risk aversion by means of variance–covariance matrices denoting the sector’s assessment of the standard deviation of prices for each instrument.Let us consider an economy with two sectors and two financial instruments, as shown in Fig. 1, but this setting is not restrictive since we can consider a general economy by an iteration of this significant case, and assume that the variance–covariance matrices of the two sectors are the following:Q1(t)=10-0.5t00100-0.5t0100001,Q2(t)=100001-0.5t00-0.5t100001.Let us choose as the feasible setK=(x11(t),x12(t),x21(t),x22(t),y11(t),y12(t),y21(t),y22(t),r1(t),r2(t))∈L2([0,1],R10):x11(t)+x12(t)=t+2,x21(t)+x22(t)=2t+3,y11(t)+y12(t)=2t,y21(t)+y22(t)=3t,a.e.in[0,1]x11(t),x12(t),x21(t),x22(t),y11(t),y12(t),y21(t),y22(t)⩾0,a.e.in[0,1],4t⩽r1(t)⩽5t+12,t⩽r2(t)⩽6t+5,a.e.in[0,1].Let us assume thath(t)=32t,t2T. Finally, let us considerτ(t)=t234tt2t4.The variational inequality, which expresses the financial equilibrium conditions, becomes(50)∫012x11∗(t)-ty11∗(t)-1-t2r1∗(t)x11(t)-x11∗(t)+2x12∗(t)-1-34tr2∗(t)x12(t)-x12∗(t)+2x21∗(t)-1-t2r1∗(t)x21(t)-x21∗(t)+2x22∗(t)-ty21∗(t)-1-t4r2∗(t)x22(t)-x22∗(t)+2y11∗(t)-tx11∗(t)+1+32t1-t2r1∗(t)y11(t)-y11∗(t)+2y12∗(t)+1+t21-34tr2∗(t)y12(t)-y12∗(t)+2y21∗(t)-tx22∗(t)+1+32t1-t2r1∗(t)y21(t)-y21∗(t)+2y22∗(t)+1+t21-t4r2∗(t)y22(t)-y22∗(t)+1-t2x11∗(t)+1-t2x21∗(t)-1+32t1-t2y11∗(t)+1-t2y21∗(t)+F1(t)r1(t)-r1∗(t)+1-34tx12∗(t)+1-t4x22∗(t)-1+t21-34ty12∗(t)+1-t4y22∗(t)+F2(t)r2(t)-r2∗(t)dt⩾0,∀(x,y,r)∈K.Following the direct method (see Maugeri, 1987) in order to find the solution, we can derive from the constraints of the convex setKthe values of some variables in terms of the others, namely we obtain, a.e. in[0,1],x12(t)=t+2-x11(t),x22(t)=2t+3-x21(t),y12(t)=2t-y11(t),y22(t)=3t-y21(t).Then, settingK∼=(x11,x21,y11,y21,r1,r2)∈L2([0,1],R6):0⩽x11(t)⩽t+2,0⩽x21(t)⩽2t+3,a.e.in[0,1],0⩽y11(t)⩽2t,0⩽y21(t)⩽3t,a.e.in[0,1],4t⩽r1(t)⩽5t+12,t⩽r2(t)⩽6t+5,a.e.in[0,1],variational inequality (50) can be expressed in the equivalent form:∫014x11∗(t)-ty11∗(t)-1-t2r1∗(t)+1-34tr2∗(t)-2t-4x11(t)-x11∗(t)+4x21∗(t)+ty21∗(t)-1-t2r1∗(t)+1-t4r2∗(t)-4t-6x21(t)-x21∗(t)+4y11∗(t)-tx11∗(t)+1+32t1-t2r1∗(t)-1+t21-34tr2∗(t)-4ty11(t)-y11∗(t)+tx21∗(t)+4y21∗(t)+1+32t1-t2r1∗(t)-1+t21-t4r2∗(t)-2t2-9ty21(t)-y21∗(t)+1-t2x11∗(t)+1-t2x21∗(t)-1+32t1-t2y11∗(t)+1-t2y21∗(t)+F1(t)r1(t)-r1∗(t)+-1-34tx11∗(t)-1-t4x21∗(t)+1+t21-34ty11∗(t)+1-t4y21∗(t)+1-34tt+2-1+t22t+1-t42t+3-1+t23t+F2(t)r2(t)-r2∗(t)dt⩾0,∀(x,y,r)∈K∼.Let us setΓ1=4x11∗(t)-ty11∗(t)-1-t2r1∗(t)+1-34tr2∗(t)-2t-4,Γ2=4x21∗(t)+ty21∗(t)-1-t2r1∗(t)+1-t4r2∗(t)-4t-6,Γ3=4y11∗(t)-tx11∗(t)+1+32t1-t2r1∗(t)-1+t21-34tr2∗(t)-4t,Γ4=tx21∗(t)+4y21∗(t)+1+32t1-t2r1∗(t)-1+t21-t4r2∗(t)-2t2-9t,Γ5=1-t2x11∗(t)+1-t2x21∗(t)-1+32t1-t2y11∗(t)+1-t2y21∗(t)+F1(t),Γ6=-1-34tx11∗(t)-1-t4x21∗(t)+1+t21-34ty11∗(t)+1-t4y21∗(t)+1-34tt+2-1+t22t+1-t42t+3-1+t23t+F2(t),and let us solve the variational inequality for each fixed coupleF1(t),F2(t). By using the direct method (see Maugeri, 1987), we get the following solution(51)x11∗(t)=21t4-34t3-32t2+160t+1288(16-t2);x12∗(t)=-21t4+26t3+16t2-32t+1288(16-t2)x21∗(t)=-23t4+14t3-104t2+224t+1928(16-t2)x22∗(t)=23t4-30t3+80t2+32t+1928(16-t2)y11∗(t)=37t3-48t2+32t4(16-t2)y12∗(t)=-45t3+48t2+96t4(16-t2)y21∗(t)=53t3-56t2+72t4(16-t2)y22∗(t)=-65t3+56t2+120t4(16-t2)r1∗(t)=4tr2∗(t)=t,provided thatΓ5(x∗(t),y∗(t))andΓ6(x∗(t),y∗(t))are greater or equal than zero. Thenr1∗(t)=4tandr2∗(t)=tare the floor prices and, as a consequence,ρ1(2)∗(t)=ρ2(2)∗(t)=0andρ1(1)∗(t),ρ2(1)∗(t)are given byρ1(1)∗(t)=Γ5(x∗(t),y∗(t))=2-t16(16-t2)[-272t4+112t3-240t2+176t+320]+F1(t),ρ2(1)∗(t)=Γ6(x∗(t),y∗(t))=14(16-t2)[-20t5+25t4+141t3-54t2-288t+160]+F2(t),ρ1(1)∗(t)is strictly positive for eachF1(t)⩾0. In fact, if we considerγ5(t)=-272t4+112t3-240t2+176t+320,we have thatγ5is positive in[0,1], as Fig. 2shows.On the contraryρ2(1)∗(t)is always positive in the interval[0,t¯], witht¯∈[0.59,0.6], becauseγ6(t)=-20t5+25t4+141t3-54t2-288t+160is positive on[0,t¯]as Fig. 3shows.Then for eachF2(t)non-negative,ρ2(1)∗(t)is positive in the interval[0,t¯]. In such an interval the solution of the problem is given by (51).As a consequence, we have the deficitsρ1(1)∗(t)r̲1(t)=(2-t)t4(16-t2)[-272t4+112t3-240t2+176t+320]+4F1(t)t,ρ2(1)∗(t)r̲2(t)=t4(16-t2)[-20t5+25t4+141t3-54t2-288t+160]+F2(t)t,which can be reduced only ifF1(t)andF2(t)decrease, even if we cannot obtain the financial equilibrium. In the interval[0,t¯]it is possible that the financial equilibrium can be reached obtaining also a surplus. a help in this sense is given by the Evaluation Index. Actually we haveθ(t)=t2,i(t)=t,∑i=12li(t)=5t,∑i=1msi(t)=3t+5,∑i=12si∗(t)=∑i=1msi(t)1+i(t)=3t+51+t,∑i=12Fi∗(t)=∑i=1mFi(t)(1+i(t))(1-θ(t))=2(F1(t)+F2(t))(1+t)(2-t),E(t)=5t(1+t)(2-t)5t(1+t)(2-t)-(2-t)(5t2+2t-5)+2(F1(t)+F2(t))=11+2(F1(t)+F2(t))-(2-t)(5t2+2t-5)5t(1+t)(2-t).Then, if2(F1(t)+F2(t))⩽(2-t)(5t2+2t-5)in the interval26-15,1(where5t2+2t-5>0), the economy has a positive average evaluation. This result has been obtained considering the averageθ(t)andi(t), however it seems convenient and desirable that the dataτij(t)andhj(t)are not too different.
