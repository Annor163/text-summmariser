@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a discontinuous Galerkin method for a nonlinear shear-flexible shell theory is proposed that is suitable for both thick and thin shell analysis. The proposed method extends recent work on Reissner–Mindlin plates to avoid locking without the use of projection operators, such as mixed methods or reduced integration techniques. Instead, the flexibility inherent to discontinuous Galerkin methods in the choice of approximation spaces is exploited to satisfy the thin plate compatibility conditions a priori. A benefit of this approach is that only generalized displacements appear as unknowns. We take advantage of this to craft the method in terms of a discrete energy minimization principle, thereby restoring the Rayleigh–Ritz approach. In addition to providing a straightforward and elegant derivation of the discrete equilibrium equations, the variational character of the method could afford numerous advantages in terms of mesh adaptation and available solution techniques. The proposed method is exercised on a set of benchmarks and example problems to assess its performance numerically, and to test for shear and membrane locking.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Shell structures are perhaps the most challenging setting for numerical analysis in solid mechanics. The primary difficulty encountered is locking, wherein the approximation power of the numerical method diminishes as the shell thickness is reduced. The problem is similar to that faced in nearly incompressible elasticity. Shear-flexible shell theories are generally formulated with two kinematic fields: the displacement of the shell mid-surface, and some representation of the rotation of fibers originally transverse to the shell surface. The root of the locking problem is that when standard finite element interpolations are used for both fields, the pair of approximations spaces taken together do not represent the thin-shell limit well. In particular, this incompatibility prevents the transverse shear strains from vanishing, leading to spurious shear energy. The problem is exacerbated as the shell thicknessttends to zero, since the bending energy is smaller than the transverse shear energy by a factor oft2, and the spurious shear energy caused by the incompatibility of the discrete function spaces becomes dominant.The goal for numerical analysis of shear-flexible plates and shells is a method that converges uniformly with respect to the thickness, while remaining simple. These requests are somewhat antagonistic, and the search for acceptable compromises has generated a large body of literature (see the review by  [1] and the references therein). Most approaches operate on the shear energy by replacing the rotations in the shear strain term with some lower order projection. There are two main techniques applied to effect this projection: one avenue followed has been mixed methods, in which the shear strain is added as an unknown, such as  [2–6] for Reissner–Mindlin plates, and the well-known MITC elements  [7–9] that extend this idea to curved shells. The other main approach, popular in commercial finite element codes, is to use a reduced integration rule  [10–12] with some suitable stabilization of the attendant rank deficiency  [13–15]. Both approaches have drawbacks: for mixed methods, the energy minimum problem is transformed into a saddle point, which leads to indefinite stiffness matrices that are more difficult to invert. From the perspective of formulation, mixed method elements must satisfy the Babuška–Brezzi (inf–sup) condition to be convergent, and proving this for any element is not a simple task  [16,17,6]. On the other hand, reduced integration methods are simple to formulate and to implement, but are ad hoc, without rigorous stability and accuracy guarantees.11Under some restrictions, reduced integration approaches are equivalent to mixed methods  [18,12]. However, this equivalence breaks down under nonlinear or anisotropic material behavior.Furthermore, it can sometimes be difficult to detect when hourglass modes are excited in complex engineering problems (e.g. high-rate dynamic problems with nonlinear constitutive behavior), which can make the use of under-integrated elements unsafe.The development of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods has provided new means to attack locking problems, as evidenced by the formulations in  [19–21] for nearly and fully incompressible elasticity and in  [22] for Stokes flow. In particular, the last 10 years has seen the development of several locking-free DG methods for Reissner plates  [23–26]. In  [24–26], the flexibility in the choice of the approximation spaces afforded by discontinuous Galerkin methods is exploited to ensure satisfaction of the natural compatibility conditions of the thin plate limit. These families of elements are locking-free without recourse to mixed methods or reduced integration. Notwithstanding these advances for plates, DG methods have barely been explored for the analysis of curved shear-flexible shells. The notable exception is the work of Güzey et al. on linear shells with their embedded discontinuous Galerkin method  [27,28].In this article, the discontinuous Galerkin approach is extended to the nonlinear analysis of finitely deforming, shear-flexible shells. In the proposed method, locking is alleviated without a projection operator by extending the compatibility strategy of Arnold et al.  [24] to shells. An advantage of this approach is that locking is avoided without the introduction of generalized force unknowns. This paves the way to casting the method in terms of a minimum principle. To this end, a discrete potential energy functional is proposed, as in the DG method of Ten Eyck and Lew for nonlinear elasticity  [20] (also related are the DG elasticity methods in  [29,30] derived from three-field mixed variational principles). The discrete equilibrium equations follow as the first variation of this functional, which furnishes an elegant means to derive the method. The variational structure also confers numerous benefits. Symmetry of the bilinear form and hence the stiffness matrix is guaranteed, since it is the second variation of a scalar potential, which is always symmetric. The tools of mathematical optimization may be brought to bear for solution, including powerful existing software libraries. The energy principle also provides a physically meaningful basis for error estimation for mesh adaptation that applies even in nonlinear problems, in which there is no natural norm  [31–33]. It is worth noting that discontinuous Galerkin methods are particularly well-suited tohp-adaptation.The structure of this paper is as follows. A review of the adopted shell theory, the classical directed surface theory in the form developed by Simo and Fox  [34], is given in Section  2. In Section  3, the new nonlinear DG shell method is proposed. (In addition, the linearized kinematics version is provided for the purposes of making normed error measurements and applying linear benchmarks in the next section.) As in any discontinuous Galerkin method, a key step is the projection of the derivative operator, sometimes called the DG derivative. The character of the shell as a two dimensional surface embedded in three dimensional space merits special attention; accordingly, a full derivation of this operator is given in Section  3.4. In Section  4, details of an implementation strategy are provided to promote adoption of the proposed method and further development. This includes the computation and storage strategy of the DG derivative. Explicit forms of the nodal forces are provided. (Explicit forms of the element stiffness matrices are additionally provided in the Appendix.) Numerical studies are presented in Section  5 as a preliminary assessment of the performance of the proposed method and to test for locking. These tests indicate that the method is promising as an analysis tool for both thick and thin shells.Throughout the paper, the notation of Simo and Fox  [34] is largely used. Scalar quantities are indicated by italic type, and vectors (inR3) are written in boldface type. Lower-case Greek letters are used to index two-dimensional tensor components, while lower-case Roman letters will be reserved for three dimensional components. A tensor index appearing twice in the same term implies summation over the range of the index.The adopted shell formulation is that of a classical single director Cosserat surface, in the form developed by Simo and Fox  [34]. For completeness, and to fix notation, the theory is summarized in this section.The parameterization of the shell mid-surfaceSis given by a smooth injective mapφ:A⊂R2→R3.22In general, a collection of parameterizations will be needed to coverS, but for simplicity they are not indexed individually here.The mid-surface is assumed to be orientable and compact, with the boundary indicated by∂S. Material points in the shell body are located relative to the mid-surface with the director vector fieldt:A→S2, whereS2is the unit sphere. The basic kinematic assumption of the theory is that points in the current placement of the shell bodyB=S×(c−,c+)are given by(1)x=Φ(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)≔φ(ξ1,ξ2)+ξ3t(ξ1,ξ2),ξ3∈(c−,c+)wheret≔c+−c−is the thickness of the shell.The reference configuration is taken to be the undeformed shell, which possesses its own mid-surface mapφ0:A→R3and director fieldt0:A→S2. Material points in the reference configurationB0=S0×(c−,c+)are given by(2)x0=Φ0(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)≔φ0(ξ1,ξ2)+ξ3t0(ξ1,ξ2),ξ3∈(c−,c+).Here and in the following, kinematic quantities in the reference configuration are distinguished from their counterparts in the current configuration by labeling them with a superscript 0.The shell deformation is given by the compositionχ:B0→B,(3)χ≔Φ∘(Φ0)−1.The kinematics of the shell configurations are illustrated in Fig. 1. It follows from the choice of the unit sphere as the director manifold and the invariance ofhthat the shell is assumed to be rigid in the thickness direction.The covariant basis vectors inS0andSare(4)aα0≔∂αφ0aα≔∂αφ,where the notation∂α≔∂/∂ξαis used to indicate partial differentiation with respect to the parametric coordinates.The mid-surface measures in the reference and current configurations aredS0=j̄0dAanddS=j̄dA, withdA≔dξ1dξ2andj̄0=t0⋅(a10×a20)j̄=t⋅(a1×a2).The Jacobian of the mid-surface deformation isJ̄=j̄/j̄0>0.The geometry of the shell is described by the surface tensors(5a)aαβ=aα⋅aβ(5b)γα≔aα⋅t(5c)καβ≔aα⋅∂βt.Identical definitions exist for the reference configuration. Eq.  (5a) gives the components of the metric tensor; (5b) measures the deviation of the director from the surface normal, that is, the relative shearing of the normal fiber; (5c) defines a curvature-like tensor. It is simple to prove that the kinematic tensors in (5) are invariant with respect to changes in frame, which is a direct consequence of the use of convected coordinates.The components of the metric in the dual basis follow from the identityaαβaβγ=δγαwhere the term on the right hand side is the Kronecker delta symbol. The contravariant basis vectors follow asaα=aβαaβ.The shell is subject to the essential boundary conditions(6a)φ=φ¯,on∂φA(6b)t=t¯,on∂tA.The configuration space of the shell is thusX={(φ,t)∈A→R3×S2:φ|∂φA=φ¯,t|∂tA=t¯}.In a slight abuse of notation, a configuration of the shell will be writtenΦ=(φ,t).Admissible variationsδΦof the kinematic fields are constructed by taking a curve of configurationsε↦Φε=(φε,tε), withΦε|ε=0=Φ, and takingδΦ=d(Φε)/dε|ε=0. Thus, the set of admissible variations isV={δΦ=(δφ,δt):A→R3×TtS2:δφ|∂φA=0,δt|∂tA=0}whereTtS2is the tangent space of the unit sphere. As the unit sphere is a differentiable manifold but not a linear space, the structure ofTtS2bears remark. A convenient description ofTtS2follows from the unit length condition inS2: taking a curve of directors as defined above and differentiating the identitytε⋅tε=1gives(7)(tε⋅ddεtε)|ε=0=0which shows that members ofTtS2are orthogonal tot(considering them as vectors inR3). That is,(8)TtS2={w∈R3:w⋅t=0}.A procedure for ensuring the satisfaction of this geometric constraint in the discrete setting is discussed in Section  3.3.The generalized forces of the shell theory are stress resultants. Taking a set of variations(δφ,δt)∈V, the conjugate pairs are33The stress resultants used in this work are scaled by a factor ofJ̄relative to the stress resultants in Simo and Fox  [34]. That is, the resultants here are Kirchhoff stress resultants instead of Cauchy stress resultants.•nαthat performs virtual work through∂αδφ,mαthat performs virtual work through∂αδt,lthat performs virtual work throughδt.For an elastic material, there exists a free energy density function (per unit area in the reference mid-surface)ψ0(∂αφ,t,∂αt;∂αφ0,t0,∂αt0).The parametric dependence on{∂αφ0,t0,∂αt0}highlights the fact that stretching is measured relative to the reference configuration. In the following, the explicit indication of this dependence will frequently be omitted for brevity. Using the Coleman–Noll procedure, it can be shown that the resultants are given by(9a)nα=∂ψ0(∂βφ,t,∂βt)∂(∂αφ)(9b)l=∂ψ0(∂βφ,t,∂βt)∂t(9c)mα=∂ψ0(∂βφ,t,∂βt)∂(∂αt).The above form of the stress resultant relations is useful for writing the equilibrium equations in weak form. However, for building the constitutive framework, it is helpful to deduce the work conjugate pairs in terms of tensors intrinsic to the shell manifold. In  [34] it is shown that the stress resultants can be decomposed in terms of effective stress resultants{n˜αβ,q˜α,m˜αβ}in the form(10a)nα=n˜αβ∂βφ+m˜αβ∂βt+q˜αt(10b)l=q˜α∂αφ+λμαm3μ∂αφ+l3t︸indeterminate(10c)mα=m˜βα∂βφ+m3αt︸indeterminatewhereλμαare components in the decomposition∂μt=λμαaα+λμ3t. The effective membrane resultant is required to be symmetric,n˜αβ=n˜βα, by the balance of angular momentum (or equivalently, by requiring that the internal power is invariant with respect to frame changes that are rotations). The components labeled “indeterminate” are so in the sense that they perform no work; therefore, in the weak form of the equilibrium equations they are irrelevant and may be ignored. In particular, the components of the stress couple resultant about the director,m3α– the so-called drilling moments– are eliminated in this shell theory.The utility of the effective stress resultants is that they are work conjugate to the variations of the kinematic surface tensors in (5). The free energy density function may be further specified to depend on the kinematics solely though the surface tensors, as inψ0(∂αφ,t,∂αt;∂αφ0,t0,∂αt0)=ψ̂0(aαβ,γα,καβ;aαβ0,γα0,καβ0).The stress relations then follow from the Coleman–Noll procedure as(11a)n˜αβ=2∂ψ̂0(aμδ,γμ,κμδ)∂aαβ(11b)m˜αβ=∂ψ̂0(aμδ,γμ,κμδ)∂καβ(11c)q˜α=∂ψ̂0(aμδ,γμ,κμδ)∂γα.The effective stress resultants and the kinematic tensors are invariant with respect to changes in frame, thus specifying the constitutive equations in this form guarantees frame indifference.Equilibrium positions of the shell are stationary points of the potential energy functional(12)J(Φ)=∫S0ψ0(∂αφ,t,∂αt)dS0−Wext(Φ).The linear functional of the external work comprises body and boundary contributions:(13)Wext(Φ)=∫S0(f⋅φ+τ⋅t)dS0+∫∂NAn̄̄⋅φj̄0ds+∫∂MAm̄̄⋅tj̄0ds.The source termfis an equivalent distributed force (per unit area in the reference configuration) acting on the mid-surface, which encapsulates volumetric body forces on the shell, as well as tractions on the top and bottom surfaces. Similarly,τis a distributed couple. The generalized forcesn̄̄andm̄are prescribed resultant tractions. To ensure well-posed problems, the regions of the essential and natural boundary conditions are taken to satisfy∂φA∩∂NA=∅,∂φA∪∂NA=∂Aand∂tA∩∂MA=∅,∂tA∪∂MA=∂A.Furthermore,∂φAis assumed to have positive Lebesgue measure to rule out rigid body motions.Equilibrium positions are found by the vanishing of the first variation of the energy(14)0=〈DJ(Φ),δΦ〉=ddε|ε=0J(Φε)for all admissible variationsδΦ=(δφ,δt). Stable equilibrium positions constitute local minimizers of (12). The variation of the energy functional is given explicitly by(15)〈DJ(Φ),δΦ〉=∫S0(nα⋅∂αδφ+mα⋅∂αδt+l⋅δt)dS0︸Wint(Φ;δΦ)−Wext(δΦ).Eq.  (15) is the virtual work equation of the shell.For the purposes of finite element discretization, the weak form of the equilibrium equations (14) suffices. However, for completeness, the equilibrium equations in strong form are recorded here. Assuming sufficient smoothness, the divergence theorem applied to the virtual work yields∫A{[−∂α(j̄0nα)−j̄0f]⋅δφ+[−∂α(j̄0mα)+j̄0l−j̄0τ]⋅δt}dξ1dξ2+∫∂NA(nανα−n̄̄)⋅δφj̄0ds+∫∂MA(mανα−m̄̄)⋅δtj̄0ds=0,∀(δφ,δt)∈Vwhereνis the (in-plane) outward unit normal vector to∂S, with componentsνα=ν⋅aα. The Euler–Lagrange equations are thus(16)∂α(j̄0nα)+j̄0f=0∂α(j̄0m)−j̄0l+j̄0τ=0}inAnανα=n̄̄on∂NA(17)mανα=m̄̄on∂MAwhich are supplemented by the essential boundary conditions. The first equation in (16) may be recognized as the linear momentum balance, and the second as the angular momentum balance.In this paper, all examples are shown with a simple isotropic St. Venant–Kirchhoff hyperelasticity model. Membrane, shear, and bending strains are defined as(18)ϵαβ=12(aαβ−aαβ0)ζα=γα−γα0ραβ=καβ−καβ0respectively. The free energy is taken asψ=ψ¯(ϵαβ,ζα,ραβ), whereψ¯(ϵαβ,ζα,ραβ)=12(tϵαβHαβγδϵγδ+tkμζαa0αβζβ+t312ραβHαβγδργδ).In the above,tis the shell thickness,μis the shear modulus,kis the shear reduction coefficient (taken as 5/6), andHαβγδis the plane stress elastic tensorHαβγδ=μ2(a0αγa0βδ+a0αδa0βγ)+Eν1−ν2a0αβa0γδ.The elastic modulusE, the Poisson’s ratioν, and the shear modulusμare of course related throughμ=E/[2(1+ν)].According to (11), the effective stress resultants are(19)n˜αβ=tHαβγδϵγδq˜α=tkμa0αβζβm˜αβ=t312Hαβγδργδ.In the following, function spaces of vector fields are indicated with bold typeface, e.g.,X. Vector-valued spaces are composed of Cartesian products of scalar spaces, which are indicated with the same letter with italic typeface, e.g.,X=[X]3. LetThbe a conforming collection of isoparametric triangle elements interpolating the shell mid-surface,S≃Sh=∪E∈ThE. The set of all edges in the triangulation is writtenΓ=∪E∈Th∂E. The symbolΓIsignifies the set of all internal edges,ΓI=Γ∖∂S.EachE∈This the image of a master elementEˆ⊆R2under the position mapE=φh(Eˆ)∈Xh. The discontinuous Galerkin function space for the positionsXhis built up from a collection of smooth discrete function spacesXhE⊆H1(Eˆ)asXh=∏E∈ThXhE.The element-wise spaces are taken to beXhE=[Pk(Eˆ)]3,k≥2, wherePk(Eˆ)is the set of polynomial of degree at mostkon the master element. Note that with this definition, the position vector can have jumps onΓI. In this work, boundary conditions are enforced strongly; consequently, functions inXhare required to satisfy the essential boundary conditions on∂φA.A standard Lagrange polynomial basis is taken. WritingNAfor the basis functions, the interpolation of the mid-surface position is written(20)φ(ξ1,ξ2)=∑A=1nxNA(ξ1,ξ2)x̄Awherenx=(k+1)(k+2)/2is the number of position nodes per element. The symbolNxwill be used to denote the number of position nodes in allTh. Because discontinuous Galerkin basis functions have support only over a single element, it is natural to identify the global basis functions with the corresponding elemental basis functions, and the same symbolNAis used for both subsequently. The reference mid-surface mapφh0∈Xhis constructed identically.Following the Galerkin prescription, variations of the positionδφare given byδφ(ξ1,ξ2)=∑A=1nxNA(ξ1,ξ2)δx̄A.The set of discrete variations is writtenVh. Due to the adopted strong enforcement of boundary conditions, functions inVhare required to vanish on∂φA.WritingThfor the space of the directors, a discontinuous Galerkin space is constructed from element-wise spacesThE⊆H1(Eˆ), according toTh=∏E∈ThThE,ThE=[Pk−1(Eˆ)]3.The function spaces of the discrete kinematic fields thus satisfies the natural compatibility conditionDXh⊆Th. This is a key step to preventing locking.A Lagrange polynomial basis is also taken for the representation of the discrete director fieldth. The interpolation is written(21)th(ξ1,ξ2)=∑AnTLA(ξ1,ξ2)tAwheretA∈S2are nodal director values andnT=k(k+1)/2is the number of director nodes per element. In the following,NTwill signify the number of director nodes in the entire mesh. At points inside an element, the linear interpolation does not guarantee‖th‖=1(and thusth∉S2), but the deviation is bounded by the interpolation error. A kinematic update procedure is adopted (described in Section  3.8) that strictly observes the unit length constraint of the nodal directors as the shell deforms.The nodal values of the director field in the reference configuration is taken astA0=∂1φh0×∂2φh0‖∂1φh0×∂2φh0‖which is the surface normal vector (i.e., the out-of-plane normal). However, the piecewise polynomial representation of the reference mid-surfaceSh0is onlyC0in general, and the surface normal vector suffers jumps across element edges. When treating smooth shells, it is inconvenient to have jumps in the reference configuration, as these jumps would need to be stored and subtracted out of the DG derivatives to avoid inducing spurious strain energy in the reference configuration. To circumvent this problem, a unique value is assigned to all spatially coincident director nodes on element boundaries by arbitrarily selecting one of the nodal values. It bears emphasis that the orientation of the reference director field does not affect the response of the shell, but rather only the deviation from it during the deformation. In our numerical implementation, the nodal values from the element with the smallest global index are chosen for this purpose.Non-manifold cases, such as finite kinks andT-junctions, can be detected and handled during this pre-processing step; see, e.g.,  [35]. Such complications are not treated presently.To preserve the essential geometric structure ofS2when constructing director variations in the discrete shell, the parameterization of the unit sphere advocated by Simo, Fox, and Rifai in  [36] is adopted. Recall that director variations are members ofTtS2(cf. (7)), which may be considered as vectors in the plane tangent toS2att; see Fig. 2. A rotation tensorΛ∈SO(3)is constructed with the property(22)t=ΛE3and where the rotation axis is orthogonal toE3. This rotation tensor is unique, and in fact has an explicit representation using Rodrigues’ formula:(23)Λ=(t⋅E3)1+(E3×t̂)+11+t⋅E3(E3×t)⊗(E3×t).The operation•̂:R3→so(3)indicates the skew cross product tensor associated to a vector.44That is, for an arbitrarya∈R3,âis the tensor with the matrix representation in the canonical basis[â]=[0−a3a2a30−a1−a2a10].The utility of this rotation is that it allows a simple representation ofδt∈TtS2with only 2 degrees of freedom. Referring again to Fig. 2,Λtakes vectors inTE3S2toTtS2along a great circle (i.e., a geodesic ofS2). The spaceTE3S2is a plane perpendicular toE3, and thus is isomorphic toR2. Taking advantage of this isomorphism, anyδT∈TE3S2can be represented asδT=δT1E1+δT2E2.Thenδt∈TtS2can be defined(24)δt=Λ̄δTwhereΛ̄:R2→R3is the tensor formed from the first two columns of the matrix ofΛ; that is,(25)Λ̄=ΛαiEi⊗Eα.The 2 degree of freedom vectorδTis referred to as the material director variation, andδtis called the spatial director variation. This parameterization automatically guaranteest⋅δt=0.Discrete versions of the director variations and other members ofTtS2are constructed as follows. Eq.  (24) is employed to construct nodal values of the director variation, viz.(26)δtA=Λ̄AδTA,δTA∈R2,A=1,…,NT.The nodal rotation tensorsΛAare computed from the Rodrigues formula above and stored for every node of the director interpolation at the start of the simulation. A geometrically exact procedure for updatingΛAas the shell deforms is given in Section  3.8.Variations of the discrete director fieldδtare interpolated with the same basis as the directors, i.e.,(27)δt=∑AntLAδtA=∑AntLAΛ̄AδTA.The set of discrete director variations is denoted byTthTh. The kinematic boundary conditions on the director field are enforced strongly; members ofTthThare thus required to vanish on∂tA.The linearized corrections returned by iterative procedures, such as Newton’s method, are also admissible variations, and are interpolated as elements ofTthThin the discrete setting as well. This implies that the director field has two degrees of freedom at each node. The parameterization described above eliminates drilling degrees of freedom identically. This is at variance with many other shell discretizations that rely on additional assumptions and ad hoc numerical techniques to control drilling degrees of freedom.In order to write subsequent equations more compactly, the notationXh≔Xh×Ththe trial solution spaceVh≔Vh×TthThthe variation spaceis introduced.A common feature of discontinuous Galerkin methods is the projection of the gradient onto a discrete function space. Following the primal formulation of DG methods in  [37], the projection will be used to define a discrete derivative operator. (Applying the terminology in  [20], this operator will be called the DG derivative.) The DG derivative formulated here operates with respect to the convected coordinates instead of the more common fixed Cartesian frame. An explicit derivation is given for the DG derivatives of the discrete mid-surface position spaceXh; the definition for the DG derivative operator over the discrete director spaceThis analogous and will be omitted to avoid being repetitious. At the close of the section, the final result of the DG derivative operator of the director is given to fix the notation.To begin, a DG piecewise polynomial function space, denoted byWh, composed as the Cartesian product of elemental spacesWhE⊆H1(Eˆ), is chosen to approximate the derivatives of the position components with respect to the convected coordinates. This space is required to satisfyDXh⊆Wh. Taking an arbitrary smooth functionu, the derivativewα=∂αucan be written in a weak form by formally multiplying by a test functionzα∈Wh, integrating overEˆ, the image of elementE∈Thunder the coordinate chart (i.e., the master element), and integrating by parts:∫EˆwαzαdA=−∫Eˆu∂αzαdA+∫∂EˆuzαμαEˆds.The vectorμEˆ=μαEˆEαis the outward unit normal to∂Eˆ. This identity, satisfied by anyu∈H1(Eˆ), serves as the motivation for the definition of the DG derivative. A function(wh)α∈Whapproximating the derivatives ofuh∈Xhis sought by defining(28)∫Eˆ(wh)αzαdA=−∫Eˆuh∂αzαdA+∫∂Eˆû(uh)zαμαEˆds,∀zα∈Whwhereû:Xh→T(Γ)is a numerical trace, to be specified as part of the method, that approximatesuon∂Eˆ. Summing (28) over all the elements yields(29)∫Eˆ(wh)αzαdA=−∫Eˆuh∂hαzαdA+∑E∈Th∫∂Eˆû(uh)zαμαEˆds,∀zα∈Wh.Here and in the following, a subscripthis attached to the differential operator to indicate that it is to be applied in the piecewise sense, element by element inTh.To proceed, some trace operators are defined. For each edgee∈ΓI, the two elements sharing the edge are designated arbitrarily asE+andE−. The jump〚•〛and average{•}operators are defined(30)〚•〛=•−−•+{•}=12(•++•−)where the superscript identifies which side of the edge the restriction of the field is taken, e.g.,u−=u|∂E−.A simple algebraic manipulation shows that(31)∑E∈Th∫∂EˆabαμαEds=∫ΓI(〚a〛{bα}μα+{a}[[bα]]μα)ds+∫∂Aabαμαds.Applying (31) to (29) gives(32)∫A(wh)αzαdA=−∫Auh∂hαzαdA+∫ΓI(〚û〛{zα}μα+{û}[[zα]]μα)ds+∫∂Aûzαμαds,∀zα∈Wh.Integrating the first term on the right hand side by parts, element by element, and again using (31) yields(33)∫A(wh)αzαdA=∫A∂hαuhzαdA+∫ΓI(〚û−uh〛{zα}μα+{û−uh}[[zα]]μα)ds+∫∂A(û−uh)zαμαds.To obtain an explicit formula for(wh)α, we introduce lifting operators on the interior edgesrα:L2(ΓI)→Wh,lα:L2(ΓI)→Wh, and a boundary lifting operatorrα∂:L2(∂S)→Wh. These are linear operators defined by the identities(34)∫Arα(a)bαdA=−∫ΓIa{bα}μαds,∀bα∈Wh(35)∫Alα(a)bαdA=−∫ΓIa[[bα]]μαds,∀bα∈Wh(36)∫Arα∂(a)bαdA=−∫∂Aabαμαds,∀bα∈Wh.Applying these definitions to (33) gives(37)∫A[(wh)α−∂hαuh+rα(〚û−uh〛)+lα({û−uh})+rα∂(û−uh)]zαdA=0,∀zα∈Wh.Recalling thatDXh⊂Wh, and that the lifting operators themselves reside inWh, the above holds only if(38)(wh)α=∂αDGuh=∂hαuh−rα(〚û−uh〛)−lα({û−uh})−rα∂(û−uh)which yields the sought projection of the derivative ofuhonto the spaceWh, in the sense of (28).The DG derivative on scalar fields defined above is extended to vector fields in the standard way, component by component. Specifically, the DG derivative ofXh∋φ=φiEiis∂αDGφ≔(∂αDGφi)Ei. This leads to trivial vector extensions of the lifting operator, such asrα(φ)=rα(φi)Ei. With the vector field DG derivative thus defined, the DG derivative of the position map is then(39)∂αDGφh=∂hαφh−rα([[φ̂−φh]])−lα({φ̂−φh})−rα∂(φ̂−φh).Applying the same formulation in this section to the director field yields a DG derivative over the discrete director spaceTh. By a slight abuse of notation, the same symbol∂αDGis used for the DG derivative of the director field, although the underlying function spaces are different. The approximation space for the director derivative (i.e., the director counterpart toWh) is denotedKh. The corresponding lifting operators for the director field are written in a sans serif font:rα,lα,rα∂∈Kh. The DG derivative of the director is∂αDG:Th→Kh,(40)∂αDGth=∂hαth−rα([[t̂−th]])−lα({t̂−th})−rα∂(t̂−th)where the boldface type on the lifting operators indicates the same extension to vector fields, e.g.,rα(t)=rα(ti)Ei.The polynomial spaces of the DG derivative spacesWhandKhare chosen as follows. Extending the strategy advocated by Arnold et al.  [24], the polynomial spaceWhEfor the DG derivatives of the position field is taken to be the same as the director spaceThE, specifically,WhE=Pk−1(E). With this choice,∂αDGφ∈Thfor everyφ∈Xh. This is essential to satisfy the thin shell compatibility condition and therefore to prevent locking. The elemental director derivative spaceKhEis not limited by locking concerns, but for simplicity is also taken to beKhE=Pk−1(E).The definition of the DG derivative is completed by choosing a numerical trace operator. The choice of numerical trace affects the numerical properties of the method, including consistency, accuracy, and the bandwidth of the stiffness matrix; a discussion of these issues is presented in  [37]. In this work, simple average traces are employed:(41)φ̂(ψ)={{ψ}onΓIφ¯or0on∂φAψon∂nAt̂(s)={{s}onΓIt¯or0on∂tAson∂mA.The kinematic boundary conditions are enforced strongly, hence the boundary trace is taken to be the prescribed value on the essential boundary to eliminate the boundary lifting operator. That is, on∂φA, the numerical trace of the displacement isφ̂(φh)=φ¯and the numerical trace of the virtual displacement isφ̂(δφ)=0. With these choices the DG derivatives become(42)∂αDGφh=∂hαφh+rα([[φh]])(43)∂αDGth=∂hαth+rα([[th]]).The discontinuous Galerkin method is derived from a discrete energy functionalJh:Xh→R. As in  [20], the discrete energy functional is consistently formulated by formally replacing the derivative operator in the continuous potential energy with the DG derivative operator. To this functional, standard DG stabilization terms are also added, yielding(44)Jh(Φh)=∫Sh0ψ(∂αDGφh,th,∂αDGth)dS0−Wext(φh,th)+12Wx,stab(φh,φh)+12WT,stab(th,th).The stabilization terms are given by(45)Wx,stab(η,ω)≔∫ΓIβxhe[[η]]⋅[[ω]]j̄0ds,η,ω∈Xh(46)WT,stab(v,w)≔∫ΓIβThe[[v]]⋅[[w]]j̄0ds,v,w∈Th.The symbolheis a local measure of the mesh diameter, here taken as the length of the edge. For the present work, the penalty parameters are normalized by takingβx=cxEtandβT=cTEt3/12, wheretis the shell thickness,Eis the Young’s modulus of the material, andcx,cTare positive real numbers taken sufficiently large.Equilibrium configurations of the discrete shell are given by the stationary points of (44). The equilibrium equations thus follow as(47)〈DJh(Φh),δΦ〉=0=∫Sh0(nα⋅∂αDGδφ+l⋅δt+mα⋅∂αDGδt)dS0−Wext(δΦ)+Wx,stab(φh,δφ)+WT,stab(t,δt),∀δΦ=(δφ,δt)∈Vhwhere the discrete counterparts(48)nα=∂ψ0∂(∂αDGφh)l=∂ψ0∂thmα=∂ψ0∂(∂αDGth)of the stress resultant relations (9) have been used. Stable equilibrium positions may be found by searching for stationary points that are local minima.Note that the minimization approach can be extended beyond elasticity to materials with dissipative behavior by recourse to variational constitutive updates   [38]. In this technique, an incremental functional would take the place of (44). Alternatively, the variational viewpoint can be abandoned, and (47) may be regarded as the definition of a DG weighted residual weak form of the equilibrium equations.The equilibrium problem can be solved iteratively with Newton’s method by linearizing the virtual work about the current state in the direction of another set of admissible variations. WritingΔΦ≔(Δu,Δt)∈Vh, the weak form (47) is linearized again to yield〈DJh(Φ),δΦ〉+〈D2Jh(Φ),δΦ,ΔΦ〉=0,∀δΦ∈Vhwhich is solved forΔΦas a correction toward an improved guess.The second variation of the discrete energy functional produces the bilinear form of the methodBh:Vh×Vh→R,Bh(δΦ,ΔΦ)≔〈D2Jh(Φh),δΦ,ΔΦ〉.Symmetry of the bilinear form is guaranteed, as the second variation of a scalar potential is always symmetric. The stiffness matrix, being the representation of the bilinear form in the chosen basis, inherits this property. The bilinear form is naturally decomposed into three partsBh(δΦ,ΔΦ)=BhM(δΦ,ΔΦ)+BhG(δΦ,ΔΦ)+Bhstab(δΦ,ΔΦ)where the superscripts are meant to suggest a material part, a geometric part, and a stabilization part. Each part if given in the following.The material part of the bilinear form is recorded here under the assumption that the mixed second partial derivatives of the free energy with respect toaαβ,γα, andκαβvanish. This restriction is typically obeyed by shell constitutive models for elastic, isotropic materials. Deriving the more general case leads to lengthy equations but is straightforward. With this proviso, the material part is given by(49)BhM(δΦ,ΔΦ)=∫Sh0[∂2ψ∂aαβ∂aγδ(∂βDGδφ⋅aα+∂αDGδφ⋅aβ)(∂γDGΔu⋅aδ+∂δDGΔu⋅aγ)+∂2ψ∂γα∂γβ(∂αDGδφ⋅th+aα⋅δt)(∂βDGΔu⋅th+aβ⋅Δt)+∂2ψ∂καβ∂κγδ(∂αDGδφ⋅bβ+aα⋅∂βDGδt)(∂γDGΔu⋅bδ+aγ⋅∂δDGΔt)]dS0whereaα=∂αDGφhandbα=∂αDGth.The geometric part of the bilinear form is(50)BhG(δΦ,ΔΦ)=∫Sh0[n˜αβ(∂αDGδφ⋅∂βDGΔu+∂βDGδφ⋅∂αDGΔu)+q˜α(∂αDGδφ⋅Δt+∂αDGΔu⋅δt)+m˜αβ(∂αDGδφ⋅Δ∂βDGt+∂αDGΔu⋅δ∂βDGt)]dS0.Finally, the stabilization part is(51)Bhstab(δΦ,ΔΦ)=Wx,stab(δφ,Δu)+WT,stab(δt,Δt).Substitution of the basis forVhinto the bilinear form leads to the definition of the stiffness matrix in the standard way:Bh(δΦ,ΔΦ)=[v]⊤[K][u],where[K]is the global stiffness matrix, and[u]and[v]are column vectors of the nodal values of the corrections and the variations. Explicit equations for the elemental stiffness matrices are given in Appendix.As an aside, sinceΔu∈VhandΔt∈TthTh, it is evident that the simplest element in the family,k=2, has 6 displacement nodes, with 3 degrees of freedom each, and 3 director nodes, each with 2 degrees of freedom, for a total of 24 degrees of freedom.Each iteration of Newton’s method yields linearized corrections that must be applied to update the configuration of the shell. The geometry of the director manifold must be considered carefully to keep the nodal directors in the unit sphere. At Newton iteratek, the current nodal unknowns(xAk,tAk)must be updated with the linear correction(ΔuA,ΔTA)to yield the improved guess(xAk+1,tAk+1).The mid-surface displacements are vectors, and so the update is achieved trivially by adding the corrections. The nodal directorstA∈S2, however, are updated using the exponential map on the unit sphere. Remarkably, this can be written in closed form. This update procedure was determined by Simo et al.  [36], and is given in Algorithm 1. This algorithm is geometrically exact, and well-conditioned under nonzero corrections of arbitrary size.In this section, the finite element method described above is linearized about the reference configuration to yield the linear kinematic version. A set of admissible variations about the reference configurations can be found by taking the curvesφε=φ0+εutε=cos‖εΔt‖t0+sin‖εΔt‖εΔtεΔt.Thus, the linearized displacements are(uh,Δth)∈Xh×Tt0Th. This leads to the definition of the linearized strains(56)ϵαβ=12(∂αφ0⋅∂βDGuh+∂βφ0⋅∂αDGuh)(57)ζα=∂αDGuh⋅t0+∂αφ0⋅Δth(58)ραβ=∂αDGuh⋅∂βt0+∂αφ0⋅∂βDGΔth.With an abuse of notation, the linearized strains are written with the same symbols as in the hyperelastic model in Section  2.5.Linearizing the potential energy functional in the direction of the variations defined above yieldsJh0(uh,Δth)=∫Sh0(12tHαβγδϵαβϵγδ+12kμta0αβζαζβ+12t312Hαβγδραβργδ)dS0−Wext(uh,Δth)+12∫ΓI(βxhe[[uh]]⋅[[uh]]+βThe[[Δth]]⋅[[Δth]])j̄0ds.The previous definition of the elastic tensor is retained. The stiffness matrix for the linearized method can be found by taking the fully nonlinear stiffness matrix in Appendix and eliminating the geometric stiffness terms. As is standard, there is no distinction between the reference and current configurations in the linear theory. As a consequence, the update formula in Algorithm 1 is disregarded.
