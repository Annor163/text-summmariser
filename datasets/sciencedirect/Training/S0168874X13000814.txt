@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A robust reduced integration solid-shell finite element in irreducible variational formulation is demonstrated in this paper. To enable shell element-like performance using a single through-shell-thickness element layer, we apply element technologies isotropically, introducing local tri-quadratic hierarchical displacement modes thereafter systematically projected to the global coordinate frame. We also enforce uniform, bilinear and linear ANS interpolations to all local normal and shear strains respectively, imposing identical in-plane and out-of-plane element response for robust 3D thin shell deformation behaviour in non-regular, trapezoidal-shaped meshes. The hierarchical strains realised improve the element performance by complementing the locking alleviating actions of the ANS-modified membrane and shear strain fields in reduced numerical integration scheme performed along the designated shell thickness. We restrict our initial numerical investigations to geometrically linear beams, plates and shell problems solely for preliminary assessment of the element's in-plane and out-of-plane behaviour in response to the uniform modification of strains and hierarchical displacement modes introduced. To this end, the results indicate robust behaviour and comparable accuracy in comparison to mixed variational, enhanced assumed strain elements in full and in reduced integration in all structural problem classes undertaken.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Widespread use of shell structures in engineering fields lends justification for sustained research in reliable numerical methods of solution predominantly based on the finite element method. Accordingly, finite element shell models suitable for the analysis of shell structures have been proposed and developed over the decades. For example, the plane stress degenerate shell model of Ahmad et al. [1] remains the most applied shell finite element model [2–4], although modern thin-walled simulations now require an advancement in the degenerate model where full 3D constitutive material laws and behaviour can be accommodated. To this end, development of so-called 3D-shell elements equipped with thickness stretch capabilities has also been realised (see [4–8] for some examples).Industry desire for simplified engineering analysis of multi-component thin-walled structures using volume (typically brick) elements but having shell element-like performance, locking-free accuracy, use a mesh of one-element layer through the structure thickness and including finite thickness change describes efforts in solid-shell element formulations. The fulfillment of this desire in solid-shell elements has been hampered by additional locking pathologies (see [9,10]) which along with such spurious shear and membrane strains in shell elements now include thickness locking which inhibits attainment of classical thin shell solutions when 3D material law is constitutively enforced in the formulation. Also, trapezoidal locking, known as curvature thickness locking in continuum shell elements, produces spurious shell thickness normal stress.Early remedies for addressing locking in brick elements in the form of reduced integration (RI) and selective reduced integration (SRI) [11,12] with hourglass control (stabilisation) procedures [13–15] have found their way in solid-shell element formulations. The assumed natural strain (ANS) [2] for tackling shear locking in continuum shell elements [16,4] has recorded successful implementation in solid-shell formulations in curbing shear and trapezoidal locking. However, to resolve thickness locking, solid-shell elements appear to be exclusively dependent on Simo and Rifai's [17] enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method within the Hu–Washizu three field variational form by employing internal strain parameter(s). Although the EAS successfully deals with thickness and shear locking it fails to resolve trapezoidal locking in non-regular meshes in contrast with the discrete gap (DSG) method [18,19] which is effective against trapezoidal locking in non-regular, distorted meshes and indeed shear locking. Notable ANS-mixed variational element technology combinations in full integration (FI) solid-shells are documented in pioneering solid-shell contributions by Hauptmann and Schweizerhof [9], the Hybrid approach by Sze et al. [20] and by others [21–26].In lieu of computational economy, the Hu—Washizu based RI formulations for brick elements [15,27] were further developed by Abed-Meraim and Combescure [28,29] and Legay and Combescure [30] within the solid-shell concept. Research in RI element technology but incorporating Simo and Rifai's EAS technology [17] for locking was initially researched by Puso [31] and Reese [32] in one-quadrature-point brick elements. Going further, a one-point quadrature, RI, EAS solid-shell element accommodating an arbitrary number of through-centre, shell thickness-aligned, one dimensional Gauss points for numerical integration was achieved by Alves de Sousa et al. [33,34] who address thickness locking through the EAS method while SRI suppressed shear locking in geometrically linear and non-linear formulations. By using closed form integration for estimating the element hourglass stiffness matrix used to effect physical stabilisation[27] of the locking-free, numerically integrated element stiffness matrix part, considerable efficiency was achieved. In Cardoso et al. [35], the SRI instabilities from shear strains observed in [33,34] were improved through a bilinear ANS interpolation scheme which is also applied on the element's normal strain fields to correct trapezoidal locking. Still within the EAS-RI approach, and using a Taylor series expansion which improves the approximations inherent in the reduced integration scheme, Schwarze and Reese [36,37] following Cardoso et al. [35] adopt EAS technologies for thickness locking, bilinear ANS interpolation for both trapezoidal and shear locking with numerical integration along the shell thickness.Formulation of RI solid-shell elements from the literature appears limited to the Hu–Washizu three field variational approach mainly through the EAS [17] methodology. An alternative contribution is presented in this paper by investigating the potential of an irreducible variational RI solid-shell formulation in tri-quadratic hierarchical displacement modes where uniform ANS interpolation is enforced on respective strains to enhance robust behaviour in non-regular meshes and encourage an isotropic element deformation behaviour. Although the element presented here is limited to linearity, the formulation being purely displacement-based and equipped with through-thickness integration points is ideally suited to non-linear material analyses. For simplicity, initial numerical investigation and appraisal of the formulation are assessed through solution of geometrically linear beam, plate and shell benchmark problems whilst deferring on-going exhaustive numerical investigation on element quality and a deeper discussion on the results obtained to separate communications.For the paper structure, we state the element's geometric definition in Section 2. In Section 3, description of the improved displacement interpolation and transformations required for global definition of the local hierarchical displacement modes along with ANS modification of normal and shear strains is presented. In Section 4, the strain—displacement matrices are introduced within the reduced integration element technology concept while the irreducible variational statement is briefly written in Section 5. Section 6 shows the forms of the locking-prone element stiffness matrices which are analytically integrated. These are then used to provide physical stabilisation of the locking-free element stiffness matrices which are numerically integrated in one dimension along the chosen designated shell thickness. Numerical results from geometrically linear beam, plate and shell benchmark assessments are presented in Section 7 while concluding statements are given in Section 8.The element's position vector in global Cartesian coordinate system is(1)x=[x1x2x3]TTopologically, the proposed solid-shell element is described by coordinates locally interpolated from 8 surface nodal values using shape functions defined in the element natural coordinate system(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3):(2)xi=∑I=18NIxËIi(I=1,2,3,…,8)The element's nodal position vector corresponding to node I of the ith Cartesian componentXËIifollows(3)xËI1=[xË11xË21xË31xË41xË51xË61xË71xË81]TxËI2=[xË12xË22xË32xË42xË52xË62xË72xË82]TxËI3=[xË13xË23xË33xË43xË53xË63xË73xË83]TNI(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)is the element's Ith node interpolation function:(4)NI=18(1+ξI1ξ1)(1+ξI2ξ2)(1+ξI3ξ3)=18(1+ξI1ξ1+ξI2ξ2+ξI3ξ3+hI1ξ1ξ2+hI2ξ1ξ3+hI3ξ2ξ3+hI4ξ1ξ2ξ3)Elements of the isoparametric nodal coordinate vectorsξIi, in natural coordinatesξi(i=1,2,3), areξI1,ξI2andξI3.

We discuss these aspects below.The purpose of the local tri-quadratic hierarchical displacement interpolation in achieving shell element-like accuracy without multiple through-thickness discretisation is to introduce the linear normal and shear strains absent in the standard isoparametric formulation thereby enhancing bending and membrane performance. Accordingly, we supplement the standard 8-node element tri-linear displacement fieldNu, with a tri-quadratic hierarchical displacement interpolationuΛand state the proposed displacement field to read(11)u(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)=uN(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)+uΛ(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)The element-by-element (subscript “e”) discretised displacement field becomes(12)ue(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)=N¯(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)uËeuËe=uËeN+uËeΛand the nodal displacement vectorsuËeNanduËeΛcorrespond to the displacement fieldsueNandueΛrespectively.

We identify the inverse of T byT−1with the following matrix element entries:(21)T−1=[T1T2T3]=[T11T12T13T21T22T23T31T32T33]Note that sinceJ|(0,0,0)andJ|(0,0,0)−1are constant in local space, we can isolate element matrices according to their dependence on monomials in(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)space, thus facilitating the use of reduced integration element technology.Discussions on the systematic transformation matrixΔ: Recall thatueNandueΛrespectively refer to definitions in global and local coordinate system, with theuËeΛvector and its componentsuËe91Λ,uËe92ΛanduËe93Λoriented along local directionsξ1,ξ2andξ3. Thus to ensure global projection accomplished through forward transformation of globally defined vectors (usingT=JT|(0,0,0)) inΔ) to local coordinate and thereafter throughT−1in backward transformation to the global coordinate system, Eq. (10), the systematic transformations embodied in matrixΔare necessary (see [9]).We can write the element's global displacement interpolation in Eqs.

Although only the minimal thickness enhancement viaΛ,ξ3ξ3, for example, might be sufficient to avert thickness locking in thin shell simulations which is demonstrated in RI-EAS solid-shell elements [33,35,36] through the use of one EAS internal thickness(ξ3)parameter, we however useΛ,ξito complement the ANS-modified membrane strains (discussed next) and ensure that no preferential enhanced directions exist, thus promoting robust response in three-dimensional beam, plate and shell analysis.ANS treatment ofNudisplacement-dependent normal strain field: We enhance the distortion insensitivity of the element in non-regular, trapezoidal-shaped meshes by enforcing uniform bilinear ANS interpolation to all normal strainsεξ1ξ1N,εξ2ξ2Nandεξ3ξ3N, giving rise to an element with identical normal directional response.

In this case, the ANS functions used for normal strains become identical to the DSG's normal strain interpolation although for shear strains, DSG functions are constant, while we have linear (ANS) shear strain interpolations. The uniform ANS interpolation on membrane strains implemented in this element's formulation being similar to the DSG method which also modifies the membrane strains inhibits satisfaction of the strict patch test [38]. Means to overcome this inhibition is the subject of ongoing research effort.Using (26) and (27), we can compactly state the following strain–displacement matrixεΛ=[BΛ][uËeΛ]forεijΛ:(37)εΛ(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)=[J10·Φ100J20·Φ1J30·Φ100J20·Φ20J10·Φ20J30·Φ200J30·Φ30J10·Φ3J20·Φ3]T[uË91ΛeuË92ΛeuË93Λe]Efficiency of theuΛapproach: In Eq. (37) we note the addition of 9 local strain modes although only 3 extra displacement degrees of freedom are introduced. Compared to the well established EAS method which would require 9 independent EAS parameters to attain the size of[BΛ]in (37), the approach presented here offers a viable alternative to expand the number of local strain modes without a corresponding increase in solution parameters.The full element strain vector (voigt notation) and strain–displacement relationship fromNu anduΛafter the ANS modifications become(38)ε˜=[ε˜ξ1ξ1ε˜ξ2ξ2ε˜ξ3ξ3ε˜ξ1ξ2ε˜ξ1ξ3ε˜ξ2ξ3]T=[Be][uËe]=[NBe|ΛBe][NuËe|ΛuËe](39)BeN=[Be0N+Beξ1NBeξ2NBeξ3N+Beξ1ξ2N+Beξ1ξ3N+Beξ2ξ3N]BeΛ=[Beξ1Λ+Beξ2Λ+Beξ3Λ]See Appendix B for nodal contributions toNBein (39) where the right superscript on the components ofNBein Appendix B indicates dependence on the individual isoparametric strain monomials.We transform the element's covariant strains,ε, to local Cartesian element strainsε^using the usual 6×6 transformation matrix [35]:(40)ε^=Fε˜=FBeuËe=B^euËeFor numerical integration along the designated shell thickness coordinateξ3, we isolate element strains into parts which are constant and another which bears sole dependence onξ3(in-plane constant).

We desire responses firstly through linear solution of beam, plate and shell benchmarks which can give indication of mesh distortion sensitivity in non-regular and warped geometries, coarse mesh accuracy, shear locking, bending and membrane behaviour quality. Solution comparisons are made with mixed variational, especially EAS solid-shells and shells. We maintain three integration points and one element layer along the shell thickness coordinate (ξ3) for element SS27.Abbreviations in Table 1mean S-S (8-node solid-shell), S (8-node solid), P.S (Physical stabilisation), I.D.P (Internal Displacement Parameters), A.S (Assumed Strain), A.S.P (Assumed Stress Parameter(s)), H.S (Hybrid Stress) and EAS P. (Enhanced Assumed Strain Parameter(s)). An asterisk “⁎” appearing in tabulated results indicates an unavailability of a result for the element in question.We investigate the in-plane and out-of-plane responses of two standard beam problems: the curved cantilever beam and the pre-twisted beam.Fig. 2shows a quarter model of a curved cantilever beam [49] discretised by 6 elements along the curved beam. The problem data is as follows: Poisson's ratio,ν=0.3, Young's modulus,E=1.0×107, inner and outer radii of 4.12 and 4.32 are denoted by Rintand Rextrespectively, the beam's width w is 0.1 units and the thickness t is 0.2 units as depicted in the figure. An out-of-plane(P2)and in-plane(P3)unit loading have been considered. The out-of-plane and in-plane normalised beam end displacements are measured along the global X2 and X3 coordinates (with reference to point o, the origin) under the actions of loads P2 and P3 respectively. The beam is fully clamped at one end and free at the other. The numerical example is sufficient to implicate thickness and trapezoidal locking in modeling curved beams.In-plane vertical, end-tip loading case: In Table 2, normalised results of the end cantilever beam tip vertical displacement (along X3 coordinate) under the action of the in-plane force P3 are given against a reference solution of 0.08734 [49]. The results here validate the benefits of the local hierarchical vector in resolving thickness locking. The accuracy and convergence behaviour of element SS27 in this problem class is clearly demonstrated in the results.Out-of-plane horizontal, end tip loading case: In contrast to the in-plane case, results from solid/solid-shell elements in the literature are not readily available for this problem. With a reference solution of 0.5022 [49], the normalised results given in Table 3for the out-of-plane, X2 displacement component under the action of load P2 are accurate estimates. The results show that the introduction of the tri-quadratic hierarchical displacement modes and the uniform application of ANS interpolation to all element strains was beneficial with no adverse influence on the in-plane shear or membrane response seen.For this problem, the geometric definition in Fig. 3is as follows: length, L=12, width, w=1.1, and thickness, t=0.05. The twist angle from the right clamped support to the free end is 90° and the elastic properties are Young's modulus,E=29.0×106, and Poisson's ratio,ν=0.22. Loadings consist of a unit out-of-plane F1 and in-plane (width direction) F2 concentrated loads. A 2×6 mesh is shown in the figure for meshing illustration purpose.Looking at results from various beam meshes normalised to the reference value of −1.3871 in Table 4, we find that element SS27 is applicable to warped mesh configurations where severe coupling between various deformations is anticipated. Although a slight flexibility is observed in the solution, nevertheless, the results of element SS27 in this obstacle problem are acceptable.Two popular plate problems in shell finite element literature are examined, the clamped circular plate problem and the shear plate.The clamped circular plate problem confirms the presence of shear locking behaviour in skew element meshes and test elements with linear geometric interpolation in modeling curved boundaries. A quarter plate model is shown by the sector in bold black lines, Fig. 4and material data used are Poisson's ratio,ν=0.3, Young's modulus, E=1.0×107, while the geometric data is 100 units radius and 1.0 unit plate thickness. A symmetric value of the downward 100 units point load is applied in the quarter plate model. Analytical solution [27] used is 2.1725×10−3. Good coarse mesh accuracy is observed and while slow convergence is noticed with linear elements in Table 5, the expected solution is approached with a progressively refined mesh.For evaluating element SS27's membrane response behaviour in a skew mesh, we solve the usual trapezoidal plate problem in Fig. 5with an end, in-plane shear load, P=1, Young's modulus, E=1.0, and Poisson's ratio,ν=0.33.The reference solution for the vertical displacement of the free end under load is 23.91. We find acceptable convergence behaviour in Fig. 6. Again the ANS modifications on membrane strains enable the element to withstand the solution deterioration from skew geometrical meshes. The benefits of additional linear (membrane) strains from the hierarchical displacement modes enhance in-plane response, ensuring the attainment of a displacement result of 23.36 to two decimal places.We investigate solutions to singly and doubly curved shell problems here.The singly curved shell structures present mixed deformations and complex membrane states [50]. Symmetry is exploited and a quarter discretisation of the roof geometry is shown in Fig. 7. The roof length is L=50, radius, R=25, and thickness, t=0.25. A volume load ofρ=360.0is applied, Young's modulus is taken as E=4.32×108 and Poisson's ratio,ν=0.0. The curved transverse edges are simply supported on rigid diaphragms. The reference solution for the vertical displacement of point A in this problem is −0.3024. In Table 6and in the normalised plot in Fig. 8the convergence behaviour and coarse mesh accuracy of SS27 element when compared with the various RI-EAS solid-shell elements, RESS [35], Sch09 by Schwarze and Reese [36] and the 7-EAS P. shell element, EAS7-ANS of Andelfinger and Ramm [45] is comparative in accuracy.We solve the doubly curved hemispherical shell problem with an 18° hole under pinching loads F=1.0 in Fig. 9, exploiting problem symmetry. The shell radius and thickness are R=10 and t=0.04 respectively. Material data is Young's modulus E=6.825×107 and Poisson's ratioν=0.3. We investigate extensional and in-extensional deformations plus rigid body capabilities in this problem which have a reference solution of 0.0940. Comparison of normalised result plots against the FI-EAS element, HIS [23] and the RI-EAS elements Q1spS [32] and Sch09 [36] is shown in Fig. 10.
