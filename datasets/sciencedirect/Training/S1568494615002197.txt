@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The soft computing, in precise rough set theory (RST) based class information and edge information is used in bilateral framework for medical image denoising problem.RST based framework is proposed as prior information for denoising purpose.The proposal is able to restrict the conventional bilateral filter to over smooth the region near the boundaries.It is extension of our conference paper with wide range of noise amount and different modalities of MR images. We extended it to real human brain MR images also.Performance has been compared with state-of-the-art methods and found to be satisfactory.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A study on bilateral filter for denoising reveals that more informative the filters are, better is the result expected. Moreover, getting precise information of the image with noise is a difficult task. In the current work, a rough set theory (RST) based approach is used to derive pixel level edge map and class labels which in turn are used to improve the performance of bilateral filters. RST handles the uncertainty present in the data even under noise. The basic structure of existing bilateral filter is not changed much, however, boosted up by prior information derived by rough edge map and rough class labels. The filter is extensively applied to denoise brain MR images. The results are compared with that of the state-of-the-art approaches. The experiments have been performed on two real (normal and pathological disordered) human MR databases. The performance of the proposed filter is found to be better, in terms of benchmark metrics.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Denoising is one of the initial preprocessing tasks for medical image analysis. The acquisition process of medical images is highly sensitive to noise or undesired signals. In general, the noise realization is assumed to be Gaussian in nature. However, it has been shown that the noise in Magnetic Resonance (MR) Image could be Rician in nature [1]. But assumption of having Gaussian noise in-place of Rician noise in low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) MRI is still holds good. Be it Gaussian or Rician, removal of noise from MR images is essential for further analysis.Initial work in the domain of denoising includes Mean and Median filters, Isotropic filter, anisotropic filter [2–4], robust statistics [5] and [6]. Furthermore, non-iterative and more edge preserving Bilateral Filter (BF) proposed in [7], revolutionized the notion of denoising. The origin of BF has been shown form Anisotropic diffusion methods under Bayesian approach in [8]. BF uses two components, one on spatial location and another on intensity values simultaneously. Since its inception, there have been many modifications of Bilateral Filter as suggested in [9–13]. However, its constant time version, in terms of computational complexity, has been proposed recently in [14,15]. It is even extended to Trilateral filters [16,17]. The third component which is used simultaneously with existing two in BF, is designed in various ways. It seems that more information could lead to better performance. In the present article, the filter proposed is trilateral by nature. The third component of the filter is based on edge information and neighborhood information. Various edge detectors, such as Canny method [18] or segmentation methods and gradient based methods such as Active Contour Methods [19,20], could be utilized for obtaining edge details. However, we are looking for edges that give rise to object boundaries which are closed in nature. Most of the above mentioned methods fail to get such closed boundaries while finding the edges. Moreover, the method such as Active Contour fails to get object boundaries where number of objects is not in power of two. The current work is based on rough set theory (RST), [21], to find object boundaries which are closed and continuous. As mentioned previously, the third component of filter also depends on neighborhood information, each image pixel is labeled as one of the objects/classes present in the image. This class information (class label) is obtained through the Rough set based mechanism. In fact, the edge map and class labels are obtained simultaneously. There are few methods available which use pair of images to denoise under bilateral framework, such as cross bilateral filter and dual bilateral filter (readers are suggested to refer [22] for more details).A rough set based rough edge map (REM) and rough class label (RCL) are used along with spatial and intensity information as mentioned in bilateral filter. REM strongly controls the effect of Bilateral Filter on edge and non-edge pixels whereas the RCL keeps track of the homogeneity within object and heterogeneity on the edges. The proposed filter serves as a joint framework for image segmentation and denoising problem, which the conventional Bilateral Filter lacks. The filter has been applied to a large set of images with various image quality measures like peak signal to noise (PSNR) ratio, root mean squared error (RMSE), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) in [23] and Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) in [24]. The performance of proposed filter is found to be comparable with the conventional methods of denoising using existing Bilateral and trilateral filters in the light of above measures. Note that progress has been made in image denoising using methods based on non-locality [25] and its implementation in medical images ([26–28]). Research is still continuing based on Non-local principle ([29–33]). Main motivation of the present work is to examine the compatibility of RST to obtain edge and neighborhood information that could be utilized in designing a trilateral filter for medical image denoising (MID) problem. Hence, the method is compared with methods under the bilateral framework only. However, this is an extension of our previous work [34] with an exhaustive set of experiments and results. The proposed method has been applied on wide range of noise level and different modalities of phantom MR images. We have presented results on human brain MR images with pathological disorder also.The paper is organized as follows: bilateral filter and its variants are presented in Section 2 for sake of completeness. Section 3 presents the proposed approach for MR image denoising problem, Section 4 presents experimental results on human brain MR images with visual examples and comparison with some of the state-of-the-art algorithms. Section 5 concludes the manuscript.
