Trends in the growth of literature of telemedicine: A bibliometric analysis

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The annual number of telemedicine publications in SCI database has grown from 10 in 1993 to 996 in 2012.Neuroscience neurology and nursing are two fields with speedily growth and might be the focus in the near future.Patients seek more convenient ways to receive care by utilizing communication technologies.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Over the past two decades, the use of telemedicine as a way to provide medical services has grown as communication technologies advance and patients seek more convenient ways to receive care. Because developments within this field are still rapidly evolving, identifying trends within telemedicine literature is an important task to help delineate future directions of telemedicine research. In this study, we analyzed 7960 telemedicine-related publication records found in the Science Citations Index – Expanded database between 1993 and 2012. Bibliometric analyses revealed that while the total growth in telemedicine literature has been significant in the last twenty years, the publication activity per country and over time has been variable. While the United States led the world in the cumulative number of telemedicine publications, Norway ranked highest when we ordered countries by publications per capita. We also saw that the growth in the number of publications per year has been inconsistent over the past two decades. Our results identified that neuroscience neurology and nursing as two fields of research in telemedicine that have seen considerable growth in interest in this field, and are poised to be the focus of research activity in the near future.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Telemedicine is developed as a solution to provide health care to the underprivileged inaccessible regions, and aims to provide equal access to medical care irrespective of geographic location [1]. It has attracted increased interest in recent years. Health care organizations worldwide have increased interest in implementing telemedicine technology to improve care and services. The continued advancement of Internet-based audio and video communication technologies that enable more telemedicine applications, combined with the increased demands on the physician supply and the patients’ desire for more convenient and efficient ways of receiving care, drive the growth of telemedicine. Over the past two decades, the functions of telemedicine have expanded significantly to include remote physician consultations, intensive care services, mental health monitoring, as well as chronic disease management, serving as a supplement or an alternative to traditional physician office visits [2]. This has proven particularly important to the improvement of rural health, as telemedicine effectively bridges the gap between inhabitants of rural areas and medical professionals located in city centers, providing specialist care, improving access, reducing long travels, and increasing the overall quality of care within these rural areas [3,4].Since the field of telemedicine is still in a period of fast growth, keeping up-to-date of the latest developments and trends can be challenging; however, bibliometrics presents a useful quantitative tool to assess the large amount of literature within this field. Bibliometric methods have been effectively used to conduct citation analysis on an entire database of articles to identify the most influential journals and their publication characteristics [5]; within telemedicine, bibliometrics was most recently used to identify trends in key term usage within publications [6]. In this study, we focused on identifying telemedicine publication trends within the past two decades with regard to publication year, country, and language, as well as the relationship between these characteristics and factors such as population density, legislative influences, and the growth of specific research applications and areas.
