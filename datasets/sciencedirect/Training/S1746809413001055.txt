@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a new filtering method is presented to remove the Rician noise from magnetic resonance images (MRI) acquired using single coil MRI acquisition system. This filter is based on nonlocal neutrosophic set (NLNS) approach of Wiener filtering. A neutrosophic set (NS), a part of neutrosophy theory, studies the origin, nature, and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra. Now, we apply the neutrosophic set into image domain and define some concepts and operators for image denoising. First, the nonlocal mean is applied to the noisy MRI. The resultant image is transformed into NS domain, described using three membership sets: true (T), indeterminacy (I) and false (F). The entropy of the neutrosophic set is defined and employed to measure the indeterminacy. The ω-Wiener filtering operation is used on T and F to decrease the set indeterminacy and to remove the noise. The experiments have been conducted on simulated MR images from Brainweb database and clinical MR images. The results show that the NLNS Wiener filter produces better denoising results in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures compared with other denoising methods, such as classical Wiener filter, the anisotropic diffusion filter, the total variation minimization and the nonlocal means filter. The visual and the diagnostic quality of the denoised image are well preserved.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful diagnostic technique used in radiology to visualize detailed internal structures of the human body. MRI is primarily used to demonstrate pathological or other physiological alterations of living tissues and is a commonly used form of medical imaging [1]. Despite significant improvements in recent years, MR images often suffer from low signal to noise ratio (SNR) especially in cardiac and brain imaging [2]. This is problematic for further tasks such as segmentation of important features; classification of images for computer aided diagnostics, three dimensional image reconstruction and image registration. Therefore, it is important to improve the SNR of the images used during quantitative analysis. This is usually done by using a denoising method, which is an important preprocessing step used to improve the image quality by reducing the noise component while preserving all the image features.Numerous approaches of denoising MR images have been proposed in the literatures. Henkelman [3] was the first to estimate the magnitude MR image from a noisy image. McVeigh et al. [4] proposed the spatial filtering and temporal filtering for reducing Gaussian noise in MR images. These filters eliminate the high frequency noise at the expense of blurring fine details and sharp edges in the MR images. A large number of edge-preserving methods have been proposed to overcome the above-mentioned blurring effects. For example, anisotropic diffusion filtering of MRI denoising proposed by Gerig et al. [5] are able to remove noise using gradient information while respecting important image structures. Recently, Krissian and Aja-Fernandez [6] proposed a new anisotropic diffusion filter based on a linear minimum mean squared error estimation and partial difference equations for Rician noise removal that has achieved state-of-the-art results. Samsonov and Johnson [7] proposed the noise adaptive non-linear diffusion method for filtering MR images with spatially varying noise levels. By using the receiver coil sensitivity profiles, the priori information regarding the image noise level spatial distribution is obtained and it is utilized for the local adjustment of the anisotropic diffusion filter.A simple wavelet based noise reduction was proposed by Weaver et al. [8]. The main drawback of the method was small structures similar in size to noise were also eliminated. Wavelet transform based denoising for Rician noise removal in MRI was proposed by Nowak [9]. Pizurica et al. [10] proposed an alternative for denoising MR images with Rician noise using low complexity joint detection and estimation method. In the squared magnitude of the MR image, introduce an analytical model for the probability of signal presence, which is adapted to the global coefficients histogram and to a local indicator of spatial activity (locally averaged magnitude of the wavelet coefficients). Subtract the constant bias from the scaling coefficients, and subsequently compute the square root of the denoised squared-magnitude image.Bao and Zang [11] proposed a MR image denoising method based on an adaptive multiscale products threshold which incorporates the merits of interscale dependencies into the thresholding technique for denoising. Two adjacent wavelet subbands are multiplied to amplify the significant features and to dilute the noise. Apply thresholding to the multiscale products instead of the wavelet coefficients to better differentiate edge structures for noise. The distribution of the products analyzed and an adaptive threshold is formulated to remove most of the noise. Thus, it is a good edge preserving denoising method. Yang and Fei [12] proposed the wavelet multiscale denoising method for the Rician nature of MR data. In this method, Radon transform is applied to the original MR images and the Gaussian noise model is used to process the MR sinogram image. A translation invariant wavelet transform is employed to decompose the MR sinogram into multiscales in order to effectively denoise the image.Nonlocal means (NLM) filter introduced by Buades et al. [13] has emerged as a very simple and effective way to reduce noise while minimally affecting the original structures of the image. Manjon et al. [14] modified the original NLM algorithm to denoise the multispectral MRI. In the multispectral sequences, the similarity measure can be obtained by combining information of various channels. Manjon et al. [15] proposed the unbiased NLM approach for MRI denoising. The unbiased NLM is obtained by subtracting the noise bias from the squared value of NLM. The main drawback of the NLM algorithm is computational burden due to its complexity especially on 3D MRI data. In order to overcome this, Coupe et al. [16] proposed an optimized blockwise NLM filter for denoising 3D MRI. This is achieved by the following steps: an automatic tuning of the smoothing parameter, a selection of the most relevant voxels for NL means computation, a blockwise implementation and a parallelized computation. Manjon et al. [17] proposed the denoising methods for three-dimensional MR images by exploiting the sparseness and self-similarity properties of the images. These methods are based on a three-dimensional moving window cosine transform hard thresholding and a three-dimensional rotationally invariant version of the NLM filter.Sijbers et al. [18–20] estimated the Rician noise level and performed signal reconstruction using maximum likelihood (ML) approach for reducing bias that appears in the conventional approach. Sijbers et al. [21] used this approach to estimate the image noise variance from the background mode of the histogram of MR image which is known to be Rayleigh distributed. He and Greenshields [22] used the nonlocal maximum likelihood (NLML) estimation method for Rician noise. This method is based on deploying maximum likelihood estimator on the nonlocal neighborhood in order to predict the underlying noise. Rajan et al. [23] used the ML based estimation of the local variance for each pixel of the image using a local neighborhood when no background information is available, like cardiac and lung images. Rajan et al. [24] proposed the MRI denoising for spatially varying noise levels based on ML estimation using restricted local neighborhoods. Recently, Rajan et al. [25] presented nonlocal maximum likelihood estimation for denoising multiple coil MR images.This paper focuses on developing a new denoising method based on the nonlocal neutrosophic set (NLNS) approach of Wiener filtering to remove the Rician noise in MRI. First the NLM method is applied to the noisy MRI and the resultant image is transformed into the neutrosophic set. The ω-Wiener filtering is employed to reduce the indetermination degree of the image, which is measured by the entropy of the indeterminate subset, after filtering, the noise is removed. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the characteristics of the noise in MRI. In Section 3, the proposed methodology of MRI denoising is described in detail. The materials used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the validation strategies and the comparative evaluation of the denoising results are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 presents the conclusion and the future scope.The raw data obtained during MRI scanning are complex values that represent the Fourier transform of a magnetization distribution of a volume of tissue at a certain point of time. An inverse Fourier transform converts these raw data into magnitude, frequency and phase components that more directly represent the physiological and morphological features of interest in the person being scanned. So, noise in the k-space in MR data from each coil is assumed to be a zero mean uncorrelated Gaussian process with equal variance in both real and imaginary parts because of the linearity and orthogonality of the Fourier transform. However, it is common practice to transform the complex valued images into magnitude and phase images. Since computation of a magnitude (or phase) image is a nonlinear operation, the probability density function (PDF) of the data under concern changes. The magnitude data in spatial domain is modeled as the Rician distribution and the so-called Rician noise (the error between the underlying image intensities and the measurement data) is locally signal dependent [26].The complex MR data is given as,(1)M=a+ibThe noise added to the complex raw data is zero mean Gaussian noise N(0, σ2),(2)M=(a+nre)+i(b+nim)The spatial MR image is the magnitude of the noisy raw data. Therefore,(3)|M|=(a+nre)2+(b+nim)2Thus, the distribution of |M| becomes Rician [23] and is represented as,(4)pM(MA,σn)=Mσn2e−(M2+A2)/2σn2I0AMσn2u(M)with I0(·) as the modified zeroth order Bessel function of the first kind,σn2is the noise variance, A is the noiseless signal level, M is the MR magnitude variable and u(·) the Heaviside step function. In high SNR, i.e., high intensity (bright) regions of the magnitude image, the Rician distribution tends to a Gaussian distribution with meanA2+σn2and varianceσn2given as(5)pM(MA,σn)≈12πσn2e−(M2−A2+σn2)/2σn2u(M)In the image background, where SNR is zero due to the lack of water proton density in the air, the Rician PDF simplifies to a Rayleigh distribution with PDF(6)pM(M,σn)=Mσn2e−(M2/2σn2)u(M)Thus, Rician noise in MR images behaves to be Gaussian distributed when SNR is high and Rayleigh distributed for low SNR. The squared magnitude image (the value of each pixel in the image is the square of the value of the corresponding pixel in the original magnitude image) has a noise bias which is signal independent and it can be easily removed. Such bias is equal to 2σ2 as shown by Nowak [9] and therefore, a simple bias subtraction will recover its original value. The estimation of the noise standard deviation σ from the noisy MR image is based on the local estimation of the skewness of the magnitude data distribution proposed by Rajan et al. [23].Neutrosophy, a branch of philosophy introduced in [27] as a generalization of dialectics, studies the origin, nature and scope of neutralities, as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra. In neutrosophy theory, every event has not only a certain degree of the truth, but also a falsity degree and an indeterminacy degree that have to be considered independently from each other [27]. Thus, a theory, event, concept, or entity, {S} is considered with its opposite {Anti-S} and the neutrality {Neut-S}. {Neut-S} is neither {S} nor {Anti-S}. The {Neut-S} and {Anti-S} are referred to as {Non-S}. According to this theory, every idea {S} is neutralized and balanced by {Anti-S} and {Non-S} [27]. Neutrosophic set (NS) provides a powerful tool to deal with indeterminacy.NS had been applied to image thresholding, image segmentation and image denoising applications [28–32]. Cheng and Guo [28] proposed a thresholding algorithm based on neutrosophy, which could select the thresholds automatically and effectively. The NS approach of image segmentation for real images [29] and for color texture image segmentation discussed in [30]. In [31], some concepts and operators were defined based on NS and applied for image denoising. It can process not only noisy images with different levels of noise, but also images with different kinds of noise well. The method proposed in [31] adapted and applied for MRI denoising [32], which shows some significant improvement in denoising. This paper is presented as an extended work of [33]; MRI denoising based on NLNS based Wiener filtering is evaluated with Simulated and clinical MR images. Since the NLM filtered image is used as the reference image for NS domain to reduce the indeterminacy of the sets, this method is suitable for denoising MR images with Rician noise.The NLM method is applied to the noisy MRI in order to create the reference image. In the nonlocal means [13], Given a discrete noisy imageu={u(i)i∈I}, the estimated valueNLu(i), for a pixel i, is computed as a weighted average of all the pixels in the image,(7)NL[u](i)=∑j∈Iw(i,j)u(j)where the family of weights{w(i,j)}jdepends on the similarity between the pixels i and j, and satisfy the usual conditions0≤w(i,j)≤1and∑jw(i,j)=1.The similarity between two pixels i and j depends on the similarity of the intensity gray level vectors u(Ni) and u(Nj), where Nkdenotes a square neighborhood of fixed size and centered at a pixel k. This similarity is measured as a decreasing function of the weighted Euclidean distance,u(Ni)−u(Nj)2,a2, where a>0 is the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel. The application of the Euclidean distance to the noisy neighborhoods raises the following equality(8)Eu(Ni)−u(Nj)2,a2=u(Ni)−u(Nj)2,a2+2a2This equality shows the robustness of the algorithm since in expectation the Euclidean distance conserves the order of similarity between pixels.The pixels with a similar gray level neighborhood to u(Ni) have larger weights in the average. These weights are defined as,(9)w(i,j)=1Z(i)e−u(Ni)−u(Nj)2,a2/h2where Z(i) is the normalizing constant.(10)Z(i)=∑je−u(Ni)−u(Nj)2,a2/h2and the parameter h acts as a degree of filtering. It controls the decay of the exponential function and therefore the decay of the weights as a function of the Euclidean distances.The NLM filtered image is transformed into NS domain. A neutrosophic set image PNSis characterized by three membership sets T,I,F. A pixel P in the image is described as P(T,I,F) and belongs to W in the following way: it is t true in the set, i indeterminate in the set, and f false in the set, where t varies in T, i varies in I and f varies in F. Then the pixel P(i,j) in the image domain is transformed into the neutrosophic set domain PNS(i, j)={T(i, j), I(i, j), F(i, j)}. T(i, j), I(i, j) and F(i, j) are the probabilities belong to white pixels set, indeterminate set and non white pixels set, respectively [31–33], which are defined as:(11)T(i,j)=g¯(i,j)−g¯ming¯max−g¯min(12)g¯(i,j)=1w×w∑m=i−w/2i+w/2∑n=j−w/2j+w/2g(m,n)(13)I(i,j)=δ(i,j)−δminδmax−δmin(14)δ(i,j)=abs(g(i,j)−g¯(i,j))(15)F(i,j)=1−T(i,j)whereg¯(i,j)is the local mean value of the pixels of the window. δ(i, j) is the absolute value of difference between intensity g(i, j) and its local mean valueg¯(i,j).For an image, the entropy is utilized to evaluate the distribution of the gray levels. If the entropy is maxim, the intensities have equal probability. If the entropy is small, the intensity distribution is non-uniform.Neutrosophic entropy of an image is defined as the summation of the entropies of three subsets T, I and F[31–33]:(16)EnNS=EnT+EnI+EnF(17)EnT=−∑a=min{T}max{T}pT(a)lnpT(a)(18)EnI=−∑a=min{I}max{I}pI(a)lnpI(a)(19)EnF=−∑a=min{F}max{F}pF(a)lnpF(a)where EnT, EnIand EnFare the entropies of sets T, I and F, respectively. pT(a), pI(a) and pF(a) are the probabilities of elements in T, I and F, respectively.The values of I(i, j) are employed to measure the indeterminate degree of element PNS(i, j). To make the set I correlated with T and F, the changes in T and F influence the distribution of element in I and vary the entropy of I. A ω-Wiener filtering operation for PNS,PˆNS(ω), is defined as [33]:(20)PˆNS(ω)=P(Tˆ(ω),Iˆ(ω),Fˆ(ω))(21)Tˆ(ω)=TI<ωTˆωI≥ω(22)Tˆω(i,j)=wiener(m,n)∈Si,j{T(m,n)}(23)Fˆω=FI<ωFˆωI≥ω(24)Fˆω(i,j)=wiener(m,n)∈Si,j{F(m,n)}(25)Iˆω(i,j)=δTˆ(i,j)−δTˆminδTˆmax−δTˆmin(26)δTˆ(i,j)=abs(Tˆ(i,j)−Tˆ¯(i,j))(27)Tˆ¯(i,j)=1w×w∑m=i−w/2i+w/2∑n=j−w/2j+w/2Tˆ(m,n)whereδTˆ(i,j)is the absolute value of difference between intensityTˆ(i,j)and its local mean valueTˆ¯(i,j)at (i, j) after ω-Wiener filtering operation.After new concepts and operators are defined in the neutrosophic set for an image, a MRI denoising method based on nonlocal neutrosophic set approach of Wiener filtering is proposed and summarized as below (see Fig. 1):(1)NLM algorithm is applied to the noisy MRI;Transform the resultant image into NS domain;Use ω-Wiener filtering operation on the true subset T to obtain Tω;Compute the entropy of the indeterminate subsetIˆω,EnIˆω(i);if((EnIˆω(i+1)−EnIˆω(i))/EnIˆω(i))<δ, go to Step 5; elseT=Tˆω, go to Step 2;Transform subsetTˆωfrom the neutrosophic domain into the gray level domain.The experiments were conducted on two MRI datasets. The first data set consists of simulated MR images obtained from the Brainweb database [34]. The second data set consists of clinical MRI collected from PSG Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (PSG IMS & R), Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India. Simulated MR images are used collectively as the reference to evaluate and compare the validity of the proposed technique. It evicts the data dependency enabling precise comparative studies. The data set consists of T1 weighted Axial, T2 weighted Axial and T1 weighted Axial with multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion volumes of 181×217×181voxels (voxels resolution is 1mm3), which are corrupted with different level of Rician noise (1% (σ=2.5) to 15% (σ=37.5) of maximum intensity). Rician noise was generated by Gaussian noise to real and imaginary parts and then computing the magnitude of the image.In the clinical data sets, the images were acquired using Siemens Magnetom Avanto 1.5T Scanner and Hitachi 0.3T AIRIS II scanner. MRI pulse sequences are pattern of radiofrequency pulses and magnetic gradients that are used to produce an image. Here, the images are acquired using spin echo sequences with long repetition time (TR) and short echo time (TE).1.Siemens Magnetom Avanto 1.5T Scannera.T2 weighted Sagittal MR image of normal brain with TR=4460ms, TE=85ms, 5mm thickness and 512×512 resolution.T1 weighted Axial MR image of tumor pathology with TR=550ms, TE=8.7ms, 5mm thickness and 499×559 resolution.Hitachi 0.3T AIRIS II Scannera.T1 weighted Axial MR image of tumor pathology with TR=249ms, TE=18ms, 6.5mm thickness and 256×256 resolution.T2 weighted Coronal MR image of normal brain with TR=5472ms, TE=125ms, 7mm thickness and 256×256×18 resolution.The performance of the denoising algorithm is measured by using the quality metrics such as peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the structural similarity (SSIM) index [35]. The peak signal to noise ratio in decibel (dB) is measured using the following formula:(28)PSNR=−10log10∑i=0i=H−1∑j=0j=W−1(I(i,j)−Id(i,j))2H×W×2552where I(i, j) and Id(i, j) represent the intensities of pixels (i, j) in the original image and denoised image, respectively. The higher the PSNR, the better the denoising algorithm is. SSIM gives the measure of the structural similarity between the original and the denoised images and are in the range of 0 to 1. The SSIM works as follows: let x and y be two non negative images, where as one has perfect quality. Then, the SSIM can serve as a quantitative measure of the similarity of the second image. The system separates the task of similarity measurement into three comparisons: luminance, contrast and structure. It can be defined as(29)SSIM(x,y)=(2μxμy+C1)(2σxy+C2)(μx2+μy2+C1)(σx2+σy2+C2)where μxand μyare the estimated mean intensity and σxand σyare the standard deviations, respectively. σxycan be estimated as(30)σxy=1N−1∑i=1N(xi−μx)(yi−μy)C1 and C2 in Eq. (29) are constants and the values are given as C1=(K1L)2 and C2=(K2L)2 where K1, K2≪1 is a small constant and L is the dynamic range of the pixel values (255 for 8 bit gray scale images).The residual image is also obtained by subtracting the denoised image from the noisy image [15]. The residual image is required to verify the traces of anatomical information removed during denoising. Hence, this reveals the excessive smoothing and the blurring of small structural details contained in the image.The performance of the proposed method has been compared with several standard and established algorithms such as Wiener filter, anisotropic diffusion filter, total variation minimization scheme and nonlocal means filter.N. Wiener proposed the concept of Wiener filtering also called as minimum mean square error filter or least square error filter in 1942 [36]. This method is founded on considering images and noise as random processes and the objective is to estimatefˆof the uncorrupted image f such that the mean square error between them is minimized. This error measure is given by(31)e2=E{(f−fˆ)2}where E{·} is the expected value of the argument. In the frequency domain,(32)Fˆ(u,v)=H*(u,v)Sf(u,v)Sf(u,v)H(u,v)2+Sη(u,v)G(u,v)where H(u,v) is the transform degraded function, H*(u,v) is the complex conjugate of H(u,v),Sη(u,v)is the power spectrum of the noise, Sf(u,v) is the power spectrum of the undegraded image and G(u,v) is the transform of the degraded image. The restored image in the spatial domain is given by the inverse transform of the frequency domain estimateFˆ(u,v).Perona and Malik [37] introduced the anisotropic diffusion filter. In this approach the image u is only convolved in the direction orthogonal to the gradient of the image which ensures the preservation of edges. The iterative denoising process of initial image u0 can be expressed as(33)∂u(x,t)∂t=div(c(x,t)∇u(x,t))u(x,0)=u0(x)where ∇u(x, t) is the image gradient at voxel x and iteration t, ∂u(x, t)/∂t is the partial temporal derivation of u(x, t) and(34)c(x,t)=g(∇u(x,t))=e−∇u(x,t)/K2where K is the diffusivity parameter.The difficult task to preserve edges while correctly denoising constant areas has been addressed also by Rudin, Osher and Fatemi. They proposed to minimize the TV norm subject to noise constraints [38], that is(35)uˆ=argminu∈Ω3∫∇u(x,t)dxsubject to(36)∫Ω3(u(x)−u0(x))dx=0and∫Ω3u(x)−u0(x)2dx=σ2where u0 is the original noisy image, u is the restored image and σ is the standard deviation of the noise. In this model, the TV minimization tends to smooth inside the image structures while keeping the integrity of boundaries. The TV minimization scheme can be expressed as an unconstrained problem(37)uˆ=argminu∈Ω3∫Ω3∇u(x)dx+λ∫Ω3u(x)−u0(x)2dxwhere λ is a Lagrange multiplier which controls the balance between the TV norm and the fidelity term. Thus λ acts as the filtering parameter. Indeed, for high values for λ the fidelity term is encouraged. For small values for λ the regularity term is desired.All the methods were implemented using MATLAB 2010a (The Math Works, Inc.) in Windows XP 64-bit Edition (Pentium Dual Core 2.4GHz with 4GB of RAM). Wiener filtering was computed using the function from Matlab Image Processing Toolbox [39]. For AD filter, the parameter K varies from 0.05 to 1 with a step of 0.05 and the number of iterations varies from 1 to 15. For TV minimization, the parameter λ varies from 0.01 to 1 with step of 0.01 and the number of iterations varies from 1 to 10. There are three key parameters that need to be set to use the NLM filter; one is the size of the search window (w), second one is the size of the neighborhood window (f) and finally, the degree of the filtering (h). For the simulation, the parameters were chosen as w=5, f=2 and h is proportional to the noise level of the image [13].The detailed images of the denoising results obtained for the T1 weighted, T2 weighted and T1 weighted with MS lesion axial images corrupted by 7% (σ=17.36, PSNR=20.52dB), 9% (σ=22.32, PSNR=18.31dB) and 15% (σ=37.5, PSNR=13.88dB) of Rician noise respectively shown in Figs. 2–4. From the visual comparison of these results, the proposed method surpassed all other methods at high noise levels on the three types of data in terms of producing more detailed denoised image in which all the distinct features and small structural details are well preserved.The PSNR and the SSIM values obtained for the T1 weighted, T2 weighted and T1 weighted with MS lesion axial images with different noise levels (1% (σ=2.5, PSNR=37.39dB) to 15% (σ=37.5, PSNR=13.88dB)) using the aforementioned denoising techniques are given in Fig. 5. As the level of noise increase, the performance of the proposed NLNS Wiener filter shows significant improvement over the other denoising methods. Table 1shows a comparison of the experimental results for the denoising methods based on PSNR and SSIM for the T1 weighted, T2 weighted and T1 weighted with MS lesion axial images corrupted by 7%, 9% and 15%, respectively. Higher the value of PSNR and higher the value of SSIM shows that the proposed filter perform superior than the other denoising methods.The detailed images of the denoising results obtained for the T2 weighted Sagittal MR image of normal brain are given in Fig. 6. The detailed features and edges in the image are well preserved by the proposed method compared with other denoising methods. The denoising results obtained for the small part of T1 weighted axial brain with tumor pathology are shown in Fig. 7. With the other denoising methods (ADF, Wiener, TV and NLM), the sharpness along the edges and the pathology structure is extensively blurred. Comparing the NLM and NLNS Wiener, it is evident that NLNS Wiener preserves well the details.The performance was also evaluated for the sequence volume of MRI scan at the specific intervals in order to take into account the influence of structural variations of the efficiency of the denoising techniques. The results for the simulated MRI volumes of the T1 weighted slices of 40–100 with 7%, 9% and 15% noise levels, respectively, shown in Fig. 8. It can be noted that the performance of the proposed method is superior to the other denoising techniques.
