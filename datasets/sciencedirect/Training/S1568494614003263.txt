Present paper proposes a new technique based on double parametric form of fuzzy numbers to solve an uncertain beam equation using Adomian decomposition method subject to unit step and impulse loads. Uncertainties appear in the initial conditions are considered in terms of triangular convex normalized fuzzy sets. Using the single parametric form viz. α-cut form of fuzzy numbers, the fuzzy beam equation is converted first to an interval based fuzzy differential equation. Next this differential equation is transformed to crisp form by applying double parametric form of fuzzy numbers. Finally the same is solved by Adomian decomposition method symbolically to obtain the uncertain bounds of the dynamic response.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Theory of fuzzy differential equations plays an important role to model science and engineering problems such as in solid and fluid mechanics, viscoelasticity, biology, physics, and others because this theory represents a natural way to model physical systems under uncertainty. Since, it is too difficult to obtain the exact solution of fuzzy differential equations so, one may need a reliable and efficient numerical technique for the solution of fuzzy differential equations. The concept of fuzzy derivative was first introduced by Chang and Zadeh [1] they proposed the concept of a fuzzy derivative. Dubois and Prade [2] defined and used the extension principle in their approach. The fuzzy differential equations and fuzzy initial value problems are studied by Kaleva [3,4] and Seikkala [5]. Various numerical methods for solving fuzzy differential equations are also introduced in [6–17].Ma et al. [6] developed a scheme based on the classical Euler method to solve fuzzy ordinary differential equations. A two-dimensional differential transform method to solve fuzzy partial differential equations (FPDEs) has been studied by Mikaeilvand and Khakrangin [7]. Taylor method is applied by Abbasbandy and Allahviranloo [8] for the solution of fuzzy differential equations. Abbasbandy et al. [9] developed a numerical method for solving fuzzy differential inclusions and in the proposed method fuzzy reachable set is used to approximate the solution. Variation of constant formula is handled by Khastan et al. [10] to solve first order fuzzy differential equations. Variational iteration method is discussed by Allahvianloo et al. [11] to obtain the exact solutions of fuzzy wave like equations with variable coefficients. The concept of generalized H-differentiability is studied by Chalco-Cano and Roman Flores [12] to solve fuzzy differential equations. Mondal and Roy [13] described the solution procedure of a first order linear non homogeneous ordinary differential equation in fuzzy environment. For general differential equation, Palligkinis et al. [14] applied the Runge–Kutta method and also proved the convergence for s-stage Runge–Kutta methods. An algorithm based on α-cut of a fuzzy set has been developed by Akin et al. [15] for the solution of second order fuzzy initial value problems. Recently, Tapaswini and Chakraverty [16,50] proposed Euler and improved Euler method for the solution of fuzzy differential equations. Prakash and Kalaiselvi [17] proposed a new method by combining the Adams–Bashforth and Adams–Moultonto to obtain the solution of hybrid fuzzy differential equations. Also they stated the convergence and stability of the proposed method. Very recently Mosleh developed a simple procedure to solve system of fuzzy differential equations (SFDEs) through fuzzy neural network. Allahviranloo et al. [18] applied variational iteration method to find the exact solution of fuzzy wave-like equations in one and two dimensions. Ghanbari [19,20] implemented Homotopy Prturbation Method (HPM) and Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM) to obtain the solution of fuzzy differential equations. Numerical solution of fuzzy Quadratic Riccati differential equation is obtained by Tapaswini and Chakraverty [21]. Allahviranloo and Taheri [22] used ADM to obtain the solution of fuzzy heat equation. Also, Allahviranloo and Jamshidi [23] applied ADM to obtain the solution of fuzzy differential equations under generalized differentiability. A dynamic response of fractionally damped mechanical system is studied by Behera and Chakraverty [24] using HPM. In [19–24], all the authors transformed the fuzzy differential equation to system of two crisp differential equations to obtain the fuzzy solutions.Similarly many authors studied various other methods to solve n-th order fuzzy differential equations in [25–31]. Based on the idea of collocation method, Allahviranloo et al. [25] investigated the numerical solution of n-th order fuzzy differential equations. Variational iteration method for solving n-th order fuzzy differential equations is used by Jafari et al. [26]. Parandin [27] discussed Runge-Kutta method for the numerical solution of fuzzy differential equations of n-th order. Homotopy analysis method for the series solution of system of fuzzy differential equations is studied by Hashemi et al. [28]. Yue and Guangyuan [29] utilized time domain methods for the solution of n-th order fuzzy differential equations. Tapaswini and Chakraverty [30] found the solution of n-th order fuzzy linear differential equations by Homotopy perturbation method. Allahviranloo et al. [31] applied an analytical method i.e. eigenvalue–eigenvector method for solving n-th order fuzzy linear differential equations.Recently, Adomian decomposition method is found to be a powerful tool for solving various linear and non-linear, ordinary and partial differential equations. The Adomian decomposition method (ADM) was first developed by Adomian [32,33] and then many authors applied this method to solve various scientific and engineering problems [34–36]. The solution is considered as the sum of infinite series, which converges rapidly to accurate solutions. Convergence of Adomian decomposition method is proved in [37–40]. Wazwaz [41] has done a reliable modification of Adomian decomposition method. Very recently Adomian decomposition method has been implemented to a wide class of problems. In all the above cases they considered the crisp differential equations. But, few researchers have also investigated the solution of fuzzy (uncertain) differential equations using Adomian decomposition method [42,23,43–45]. Allahviranloo et al. [42,23] successfully applied Adomian decomposition method for the solution of fuzzy heat equations and also to solve the fuzzy differential equation under generalized differentiability. The Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM) is used by Allahviranloo et al. [43] for solving “Fuzzy differential inclusions” and they handle linear and nonlinear fuzzy initial value problem to show the efficiency of the proposed method (ADM). Babolian et al. [44] implemented Adomian method to find the approximate solution in crisp case and then they applied the same method to fuzzy initial value problems. Numerical solution of second-order fuzzy differential equations under strongly generalized differentiability has been studied by Wang and Guo [45] using Adomian decomposition method.Bede [46] described the exact solutions of fuzzy differential equations in his note in an excellent way. Ahmada et al. [47] investigated analytical and numerical solutions of fuzzy differential equations based on the extension principle. Buckley and Feuring [48] applied two analytical methods for solving n-th order linear differential equations with fuzzy initial conditions. Their first method of solution was to fuzzify the crisp solution and then check to see if it satisfies the differential equations with fuzzy initial conditions and the second method was the reverse of the first method. In the second method they first solved the fuzzy initial value problem and checked to see if it defined a fuzzy function.Above literature review reveals that the fuzzy differential equations related to the physical systems are always converted to two crisp differential equations. Then corresponding crisp systems are solved to obtain the fuzzy solution. But in the proposed methodology, the uncertain dynamic beam equation has been converted to a single crisp differential equation using a new concept of double parametric form of fuzzy numbers. Finally the corresponding crisp (single) differential equation is solved by Adomian decomposition method to obtain the fuzzy solution in double parametric form.Present paper is organized as follows. In section ‘Preliminaries’, we give some basic preliminaries related to the present investigation. Adomain decomposition method is discussed in section ‘Adomian decomposition method’. In section ‘Double parametric based solution of uncertain beam using ADM’ proposed technique based on double parametric form of fuzzy numbers is discussed to solve uncertain beam equation using ADM. Next uncertain response analysis subjected to unit impulse and step loads is presented followed by numerical results and discussions. Finally in the last section conclusions are drawn.In this section, we present some notations, definitions and preliminaries which are used further in this paper [49–52].Definition 2.1Fuzzy numberA fuzzy numberU˜is convex normalized fuzzy setU˜of the real line R such that{μU˜(x):R→[0,1],∀x∈R}where,μU˜is called the membership function of the fuzzy set and it is piecewise continuous.A triangular fuzzy numberU˜is a convex normalized fuzzy setU˜of the real line R such that1.There exists exactly one x0∈R withμU˜(x0)=1(x0 is called the mean value ofU˜), whereμU˜is called the membership function of the fuzzy set.μU˜(x)is piecewise continuous.Let us consider an arbitrary triangular fuzzy numberU˜=(a,b,c). The membership functionμU˜ofU˜will be define as followsμU˜(x)=0,x≤ax−ab−a,a≤x≤bc−xc−b,b≤x≤c0,x≥cThe triangular fuzzy numberU˜=(a,b,c)can be represented with an ordered pair of functions through α-cut approach viz.[u_(α),u¯(α)]=[(b−a)α+a,−(c−b)α+c]where, α∈[0, 1].The α-cut form is known as parametric form or single parametric form of fuzzy numbers. It may be noted that the lower and upper bounds of the fuzzy numbers satisfy the following requirementsi.u_(α)is a bounded left continuous non-decreasing function over [0,1].u¯(α)is a bounded right continuous non-increasing function over [0,1].u_(α)≤u¯(α),0≤α≤1.Using the parametric form as discussed in Definition 2.3 we haveU˜=[u_(α),u¯(α)].Now one may write this as crisp number with double parametric form asU˜(α,β)=βu¯(α)−u_(α)+u_(α)where α and β∈[0, 1].A fuzzy numberU˜is said to be positive, denoted byU˜>0if its membership functionμU˜(x)satisfiesμU˜(x)=0,∀x≤0.For any two arbitrary fuzzy numberx˜=[x_(α),x¯(α)],y˜=[y_(α),y¯(α)]and scalar k, the fuzzy arithmetic is defined as follows,i.x˜=y˜if and only ifx_(α)=y_(α)andx¯(α)=y¯(α)x˜+y˜=[x_(α)+y_(α),x¯(α)+y¯(α)]x˜×y˜=min(S),max(S), where,S={x_(α)×y_(α),x_(α)×y¯(α),x¯(α)×y_(α),x¯(α)×y¯(α)}kx˜=[kx¯(α),kx_(α)],k<0[kx_(α),kx¯(α)],k≥0To illustrate the basic idea of this method, we consider the following differential equation of the form.(1)Fu=gwhere, F is a general differential operator. F can be divided into three parts which are L, R and N, where L is an easily or trivially invertible linear operator, R is the remaining linear part, and N represents a nonlinear operator. Eq. (1) can therefore be written as follows:(2)Lu+Ru+Nu=g,We may write Eq. (2) as(3)Lu=g−Ru−Nu.Applying the inverse operator L−1 (which is the inverse of the operator L) on both sides of Eq. (3) one may obtain the following equations(4)L−1Lu=L−1g−L−1Ru−L−1Nu.For initial value problems, conventionally define L−1 forL≡∂n∂tnas the n-fold definite integration operator from 0 to t. IfL≡∂2∂t2is a second order operator, then L−1 is a two fold integration operator.We have L−1Lu=u(t)−u(0)−tu′(0) and therefore Eq. (4) becomes(5)u(t)=u(0)+tu′(0)+L−1g−L−1Ru−L−1NuAccording to ADM [33,34], the solution u is assumed as infinite sum of series(6)u=∑n=0∞unand the nonlinear term Nu is decomposed as follows(7)Nu=∑n=0∞An(u0,u1,u2,…,un)where,An′sare the set of Adomian polynomials. TheAn′scan be found from the formula(8)An=1n!∂n∂λnN∑w=1nλiuiλ=0Now, Substituting Eqs. (6) and (7) into Eq. (5) we get(9)u=∑n=0∞un=u0−L−1R∑n=0∞un−L−1∑n=0∞Anwhere, u0=u(0)+tu′(0)+L−1gun+1=−L−1Run−L−1∑n=0∞An,n≥0.Putting the values of u0, u1, u2, … in Eq. (5), u is obtained. The above convergence has been rigorously established by Cherruault [39], Abbaoui and Cherruault [37,38] and Himoun et al. [40].Here, we first convert the fuzzy differential equation to interval based fuzzy differential equation using single parametric form. Then by using double parametric form, interval based fuzzy differential equation is reduced to crisp differential equation. Now, we apply Adomian decomposition method to solve the corresponding differential equation. As per the titled problem, let us now consider the fuzzy beam equation(10)ρA∂2v˜∂t2+c∂v˜∂t+EI∂4v˜∂x4=F(x,t),The above Eq. (10) may be written as(11)∂2v˜∂t2+cρA∂v˜∂t+EIρA∂4v˜∂x4=F(x,t)ρA,where ρ, A, c, E and I represents the mass density, cross sectional area, damping coefficients per unit length, Young's modulus of elasticity and moment of inertia of the beam. F(x, t) is the externally applied force andv˜(x,t;α)is the transverse fuzzy displacement. Fuzzy initial conditions are considered asv˜(0)=v˜′(0)=(−0.1,0,0.1).As per the single parametric form we may write the above fuzzy beam equation (Eq. (11)) as(12)∂2v_(t;α)∂t2,∂2v¯(t;α)∂t2+cρA∂v_(t;α)∂t,∂v¯(t;α)∂t+EIρA∂4v_(t;α)∂x4,∂4v¯(t;α)∂x4=F(x,t)ρAsubject to fuzzy initial conditionv_(0;α),v¯(x,0;α)=v′_(0;α),v¯′(0;α)=[0.1α−0.1,0.1−0.1α]where,α∈[0,1]Next using the double parametric form (as discussed in Definition 2.4) the above Eq. (12) can be expressed as(13)β∂2v¯(t;α)∂t2−∂2v_(t;α)∂t2+∂2v_(t;α)∂t2+cρAβ∂v¯(t;α)∂t−∂v_(t;α)∂t+∂v_(t;α)∂t+EIρAβ∂4v¯(t;α)∂x4−∂4v_(t;α)∂x4+∂4v_(t;α)∂x4=F(x,t)ρAsubject to the initial conditions{β(v¯(0;α)−v_(0;α))+v_(0;α)}={β(v¯'(0;α)−v′_(0;α))+v′_(0;α)}={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}where, α, β∈[0, 1]Let us now denoteβ∂2v¯(t;α)∂t2−∂2v_(t;α)∂t2+∂2v_(t;α)∂t2=∂2v˜(t;α,β)∂t2,β∂v¯(t;α)∂t−∂v_(t;α)∂t+∂v_(t;α)∂t=∂v˜(t;α,β)∂t,β∂4v¯(t;α)∂x4−∂4v_(t;α)∂x4+∂4v_(t;α)∂x4=∂4v˜(t;α,β)∂x4,{β(v¯(0;α)−v_(0;α))+v_(0;α)}=v˜(0;α,β)and{β(v¯′(0;α)−v′_(0;α))+v′_(0;α)}=v˜′(0;α,β).Substituting these values in Eq. (13) we get(14)∂2v˜(t;α,β)∂t2+cρA∂v˜(t;α,β)∂t+EIρA∂4v˜(t;α,β)∂x4=F(x,t)ρA,with initial conditionsv˜(0;α,β)=v˜'(0;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}.Hence, solving the corresponding crisp differential equation one may get the solution asv˜(t;α,β). To obtain the lower and upper bound of the solution in single parametric form we may put β=0 and 1 respectively. This may be represented asv˜(t;α,0)=v_(t,α)andv˜(t,α,1)=v¯(t,α)We have applied Adomian decomposition method to solve Eq. (14) and consider Eq. (14) as(15)Lttv˜(t;α,β)=−cρALtv˜(t;α,β)−EIρALxxxxv˜(t;α,β)+F(x,t)ρAwhereLtt≡∂2/∂t2,Lt≡∂/∂tandLxxxx≡∂4/∂x4.Applying the operatorLtt−1(which is the inverse operator of Ltt) on both sides of Eq. (15), The equivalent expression is(16)Ltt−1Lttv˜(t;α,β)=Ltt−1−cρALtv˜(t;α,β)−EIρALxxxxv˜(t;α,β)+F(x,t)ρANow, we haveLtt−1Lttv˜(t;α,β)=v˜(t;α,β)−v˜(0;α,β)−tv˜t(0;α,β)Then Eq. (16) becomes(17)v˜(t;α,β)=v˜(0;α,β)+tv˜t(0;α,β)+Ltt−1F(x,t)ρA−cρALtt−1Ltv˜(t;α,β)−EIρALtt−1Lxxxxv˜(t;α,β)According to Adomian decomposition [33,34] we assume an infinite series solution for unknown functionv(t;α,β)as(18)v˜(t;α,β)=∑n=0∞v˜n(t;α,β)withv˜0(t;α,β)=v˜(0;α,β)+tv˜t(0;α,β)+Ltt−1F(x,t)ρAand the componentsv˜n(t;α,β)where, n>0 are usually determined byv˜1(t;α,β)=Ltt−1−cρA∂v˜0(t;α,β)∂t−EIρA∂4v˜0(t;α,β)∂x4,v˜2(t;α,β)=Ltt−1−cρA∂v˜1(t;α,β)∂t−EIρA∂4v˜1(t;α,β)∂x4,v˜3(t;α,β)=Ltt−1−cρA∂v˜2(t;α,β)∂t−EIρA∂4v˜2(t;α,β)∂x4,⋮and so on.Now substituting these terms in Eq. (18) one may get the approximate solution of Eq. (14) as follows.(19)v(t;α,β)=v˜0(t;α,β)+v˜1(t;α,β)+v˜2(t;α,β)+v˜3(t;α,β)+⋯The above series converge very rapidly [37–40], and the rapid convergence means that only few terms are required to get the approximate solutions.Let us consider the external applied force F(x, t) asF(x,t)=f(x)g(t)where f(x) is a specified space dependent deterministic function, and g(t) is time dependent process. In the following paragraph, we will examine the uncertain response of the dynamic system (14) subject to two different loading conditions.We will now consider the response of the fuzzy beam subject to a unit step load of the form g(t)=Bu(t) where, u(t) is the Heaviside function and B is a constant. By using ADM we have(20)v˜0(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}(1+t)+Bft22ρA,(21)v˜1(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}−cρAt2Γ(3)−cBfρ2A2t3Γ(4)−EIBf(4)ρ2A2t4Γ(5),(22)v˜2(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}c2ρ2A2t3Γ(4)+c2Bfρ3A3t4Γ(5)+2EIBcf(4)ρ3A3t5Γ(6)+E2I2Bf(8)ρ3A3t6Γ(7),(23)v˜3(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}−c3ρ3A3t4Γ(5)+c3Bfρ4A4t5Γ(6)−3EIBc2f(4)ρ4A4t6Γ(7)−3E2I2Bcf(8)ρ4A4t7Γ(8)−E3I3Bf(12)ρ4A4t8Γ(9),and so on, wheref(i)=∂if∂xi.In the similar manner the rest of the components can be obtained. Therefore, the solution can be written in general form as(24)v˜(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}1+∑k=0∞−cρAktk+1Γ(k+2)+BρA∑r=0∞(−1)rr!EIρArf(4r)t2(r+1)∑j=0∞−cρAj(j+r)!tjj!Γ(j+2r+3)To obtain the solution bound in single parametric form we may put β=0 and 1 to get the lower and upper bound of the solution respectively. This may be represented asv˜(t;α,0)=v_(t,α)andv˜(t,α,1)=v¯(t,α).(25)v_(t;α,0)=v_(t;α)=(0.1α−0.1)1+∑k=0∞−cρAktk+1Γ(k+2)+BρA∑r=0∞(−1)rr!EIρArf(4r)t2(r+1)∑j=0∞−cρAj(j+r)!tjj!Γ(j+2r+3)(26)v¯(t;α,1)=v¯(t;α)=(0.1−0.1α)1+∑k=0∞−cρAktk+1Γ(k+2)+BρA∑r=0∞(−1)rr!EIρArf(4r)t2(r+1)∑j=0∞−cρAj(j+r)!tjj!Γ(j+2r+3)Next we consider response of the fuzzy beam subject to an unit impulse load of the form g(t)=δ(t) where δ(t) is the unit impulse function. Using ADM in this case again, we have(27)v˜0(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}(1+t)+ftρA,(28)v˜1(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}−cρAt2Γ(3)−cfρ2A2t2Γ(3)−EIf(4)ρ2A2t3Γ(4),(29)v˜2(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}c2ρ2A2t3Γ(4)+c2fρ3A3t3Γ(4)+2EIcf(4)ρ3A3t4Γ(5)+E2I2f(8)ρ3A3t5Γ(6),(30)v˜3(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}−c3ρ3A3t4Γ(5)+c3fρ4A4t4Γ(5)−3EIc2f(4)ρ4A4t5Γ(6)−3E2I2cf(8)ρ4A4t6Γ(7)−E3I3Bf(12)ρ4A4t7Γ(8),and so on, wheref(i)=∂if∂xi.Proceeding as above, rest of the components can be obtained and the solution can be written in general form as(31)v˜(t;α,β)={β(0.2−0.2α)+(0.1α−0.1)}1+∑k=0∞−cρAktk+1Γ(k+2)+1ρA∑r=0∞(−1)rr!EIρArf(4r)t2r+1∑j=0∞−cρAj(j+r)!tjj!Γ(j+2r+2)We may again obtain the lower and upper bound of the solution respectively and these are represented asv˜(t;α,0)=v_(t,α)andv˜(t,α,1)=v¯(t,α).(32)v_(t;α,0)=v_(t;α)=(0.1α−0.1)1+∑k=0∞−cρAktk+1Γ(k+2)+1ρA∑r=0∞(−1)rr!EIρArf(4r)t2r+1∑j=0∞−cρAj(j+r)!tjj!Γ(j+2r+2)(33)v¯(t;α,1)=v¯(t;α)=(0.1−0.1α)1+∑k=0∞−cρAktk+1Γ(k+2)+1ρA∑r=0∞(−1)rr!EIρArf(4r)t2r+1∑j=0∞−cρAj(j+r)!tjj!Γ(j+2r+2)In this section, we present the numerical solution of uncertain beam equation using Adomian decomposition method (ADM). It is a gigantic task to include here all the results with respect to various parameters involved in the corresponding equation. As discussed above, uncertain responses subject to unit step and impulse responses have been considered here. Computed results are depicted in term of plots. For the numerical results we have considered the simply supported beam, hence we have [53,54]f(x)=sinπxLHere the numerical computations have been done by truncating the infinite series (25), (26) and (32), (33) to a finite number of terms. For numerical simulations, let us denote c/m and EI/ρA respectively as 2ηω3/2 and ω2 where, ω is the natural frequency and η is the damping ratio. The values of the parameters are taken [53,54] as B=1, ρA=1, L=π and m=1.Let us first consider x=1/2, natural frequency ω=5rad/s with damping ratio η=0.05 and 0.1 as constant. Obtained interval results for unit step response are depicted in Fig. 1for different values of α=0.5, 0.8 and 1. It may clearly be seen that increase in the value of the damping ratios decrease the oscillations. Similarly for ω=10rad/s obtained results are depicted in Fig. 2. Similar observations are made with above parametric values for unit impulse load and computed interval results are cited in Figs. 3 and 4for ω=5rad/s and 10rad/s respectively.In the above cases interval solutions are obtained for particular value of α. Now varying both t and α we get the fuzzy responses for damping ratio η=0.05 and 0.1. Figs. 5 and 6give the unit step fuzzy responses for ω=5rad/s and 10rad/s, respectively. Also for unit impulse load, computed fuzzy impulse responses for ω=5rad/s and 10rad/s are depicted in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. One may see from the cited results that the lower and upper bounds of the uncertain responses are same for α=1. This is because the bounds of the initial condition are also same for α=1 and it converts to crisp initial condition.In order to verify the results obtained by the present method we have compared the results of [53,54] of order 1 with that of ours in special case of α=1 (that is for the crisp initial condition).Lower and upper bounds of unit step responses represented in Eqs. (25) and (26) are transformed to Eq. (34) for α=1 as below(34)v_(t;1)=v¯(t;1)=BρA∑r=0∞(−1)rr!EIρArf(4r)t2(r+1)∑j=0∞−cρAj(j+r)!tjj!Γ(j+2r+3)The above expression (Eq. (34)) exactly matches with solution obtained from [53,54] for unit step response of order 1 viz.(35)BρA∑r=0∞(−1)rr!EIρArf(4r)t2(r+1)∑j=0∞−cρAj(j+r)!tjj!Γ(j+2r+3).Similarly for α=1, bounds of the impulse response as cited in Eqs. (32) and (33) will reduce to(36)v_(t;1)=v¯(t;1)=1ρA∑r=0∞(−1)rr!EIρArf(4r)t2(r+1)∑j=0∞−cρAj(j+r)!tjj!Γ(j+2r+2).which is exactly same as [53] for impulse response of order 1.Results for both the responses with different parameters are given in Tables 1–4. Also these Tables include comparison of present results with Zu-feng and Xiao-yan [53] and Behera and Chakraverty [54] in special case and are found to be in good agreement. In Zu-feng and Xiao-yan [53] and Behera and Chakraverty [54], the authors have studied the numerical solution of crisp fractional differential equations only.For comparison purpose, the present problem is also solved using the methods of Ghanbari [20] and Behera and Chakraverty [24]. Accordingly, Tables 5–8show the comparison between present, Ghanbari [20] and Behera and Chakraverty [24] for fourth order approximation. One may notice that the obtained results are again found to be in good agreement. It may however be noted that the computational complexity is less in the present method as we solve only one crisp differential equation rather than system of two differential equations.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper double parametric form of fuzzy numbers has successfully been applied to the solution of an uncertain simply supported beam using Adomian decomposition method. The double parametric form approach is found to be easy and straight forward. Here, performance of the method is shown by using triangular fuzzy number. It is interesting to note for α=1 in both the responses that lower response is equal to the upper response. Though the solution by ADM is of the form of an infinite series, it can be written in a closed form. The main advantage of ADM is the capability to achieve exact solution and rapid convergence with few terms.
