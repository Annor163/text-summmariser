@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Similarity analysis and preference information aggregation are two important issues for consensus building in group decision making with preference relations. Pairwise ratings in an interval reciprocal preference relation (IRPR) are usually regarded as interval-valued And-like representable cross ratios (i.e., interval-valued cross ratios for short) from the multiplicative perspective. In this paper, a ratio-based formula is introduced to measure similarity between a pair of interval-valued cross ratios, and its desirable properties are provided. We put forward ratio-based similarity measurements for IRPRs. An induced interval-valued cross ratio ordered weighted geometric (IIVCROWG) operator with interval additive reciprocity is developed to aggregate interval-valued cross ratio information, and some properties of the IIVCROWG operator are presented. The paper devises an importance degree induced IRPR ordered weighted geometric operator to fuse individual IRPRs into a group IRPR, and discusses the derivation of its associated weights. By employing ratio-based similarity measurements and IIVCROWG-based aggregation operators, a soft consensus model including a generation mechanism of feedback recommendation rules is further proposed to solve group decision making problems with IRPRs. Three numerical examples are examined to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Group decision making (GDM) involves a group of decision makers and its goal is to obtain a collective alternative ranking or choose the best alternative(s) from multiple alternatives. Each decision maker usually adopts the pairwise comparison to derive his/her ratings over alternatives and structures the ratings as a preference relation. In the classical analytic hierarchy process (AHP), preference information is expressed by ratio-based precise ratings under the 1–9 scale and organized as multiplicative preference relations [1]. It is frequently unrealistic and inflexible for decision makers to elicit precise ratings because of complexity of decision making problems and granularity of preference information [2–6]. To cope with such inflexibility and difficulty, other types of preference relations have been developed to represent decision makers’ ratings with vagueness and indeterminacy, such as reciprocal preference relations [7,8] (also called fuzzy preference relations [9]), triangular fuzzy preference relations [10], intuitionistic multiplicative preference relations [11] and interval reciprocal preference relations (IRPRs) [12].A typical approach for solving a GDM problem with preference relations consists of two various processes [13,14]: the consensus process and the selection process. The former refers to how to achieve the maximum degree of agreement among the decision makers on the solution alternatives, while the latter consists in how to derive a solution set of alternatives from the ratings on the alternatives provided by the decision makers. The consensus process is often carried out before the selection process. It is necessary to build a consensus model for solving GDM problems because the decision makers initially can have disagreeing ratings [15–18] and a lack of consensus entails high entropy (i.e., high disorder) in epistemic sense [19–21]. In the literature, different consensus models [13–22] have been developed for GDM problems. It is usually difficult to obtain a full and unanimous consensus in practice. An alternative method is to employ soft consensus measurements [23]. Herrera-Viedma et al. [24] presented an excellent review of soft consensus models under fuzzy environments.IRPRs characterize pairwise comparison ratings by [0, 1]-valued interval values. Dubois and Prade [25] indicated that it is suitable to use [0, 1]-valued intervals to capture decision makers’ imprecise and indeterminate ratings. A number of researchers have been exploring consistency [26–30] and the elicitation of interval-valued priorities based on IRPRs [27,29–33]. In these research papers, the ratings in IRPRs are regarded as interval-valued and-like representable cross ratios (i.e., interval-valued cross ratios for short) from the multiplicative perspective and provided by decision makers under a]0, 1[-valued bipolar scale associated with the uninormxyxy+(1−x)(1−y). This paper focuses on soft consensus building for GDM problems under IRPRs with interval-valued cross ratios.Similarity (also called compatibility) measurements are efficient soft tools for capturing consensus degrees of decision makers’ ratings, and have been widely used to develop consensus models for solving GDM problems with preference relations [14–18,34]. Xu [12] defined compatibility of IRPRs by using the Hamming distance between two IRPRs. Tapia Garcia et al. [34] employed Hamming-distance-based similarity matrices to calculate the proximity of an IRPR with respect to the group IRPR, and determine the global consensus degree based on the arithmetic mean. It is important but still a vacancy to consider the similarity of IRPRs with interval-valued cross ratios in GDM. This leads to our research on ratio-based similarity measurements for a pair of interval-valued cross ratios and IRPRs.Another challenged issue in GDM is to aggregate individual ratings into a group preference. To this end, different aggregation operators have been devised [35,36] and various information fusion methods have been developed [34,37–40] for different preference relations. Tapia Garcia et al. [34] used the arithmetic mean operator to aggregate individual IRPRs into a collective IRPR. However, it may reduce the multiplicative consistency [30] (also called geometric consistency [29]) level of the aggregated IRPR (see Example 1 in Section 4). On the other hand, it is difficult to directly employ the weighted geometric operator to aggregate interval-valued cross ratio information for GDM with IRPRs because the results obtained by applying this operator have no interval additive reciprocity for reciprocal argument values. These lead to our research on aggregation operators for interval-valued cross ratios and IRPRs.The aim of the paper is to present a soft consensus approach based on ratio-based similarity measurements to deal with GDM problems under IRPRs with interval-valued cross ratios. One of the key novelties in this work is the proposal of ratio-based similarity measurements for a pair of interval-valued cross ratios and IRPRs. The paper devises a ratio based bipolar 0.1–0.9 scale. By using the uninormxyxy+(1−x)(1−y)and extending the induced ordered weighted geometric (IOWG) operator, we introduce an induced interval-valued cross ratio ordered weighted geometric (IIVCROWG) operator to aggregate interval-valued cross ratio information, and put forward an importance degree induced IRPR ordered weighted geometric (ID-IIRPROWG) operator to aggregate individual IRPRs into a group IRPR. Some desirable properties are also explored for the aggregation operators. Based on similarity measurements and IIVCROWG-based aggregation operators, a soft consensus model including a feedback mechanism is further developed for solving GDM problems with IRPRs.The remainder of the paper is arranged as below. Section 2 introduces preliminaries on reciprocal preference relations, IRPRs and interval arithmetic. A ratio-based similarity measurement is defined for a pair of interval-valued cross ratios and ratio-based similarity measurements are put forward for IRPRs in Section 3. Section 4 develops IIVCROWG aggregation operators and puts forward their properties. Section 5 presents a consensus model for GDM with IRPRs. Two illustrative examples are provided in Section 6 to demonstrate the proposed soft consensus model. Section 7 draws concluding remarks.In this section, some basic concepts with regard to reciprocal preference relations, IRPRs and interval arithmetic are presented to facilitate future discussion.Consider a decision making problem having n alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, n). Let X={x1, x2, …, xn}. A decision maker compares pairs of the alternatives in X, and elicits his/her ratings by means of a reciprocal preference relation defined below.Definition 2.1[7,8]A reciprocal preference relation on X is defined by an additive reciprocal comparison matrixR=(rij)n×nwith(2.1)0≤rij≤1,rij+rji=1,rii=0.5,i,j=1,2,…,nwhere rijshows the [0, 1]-valued rating of xiover xj.If 0<rij<1, i, j=1, 2, …, n, we haverij=0.5rij0.5rij+(1−0.5)(1−rij)=(rij/rji)1+(rij/rji). Thus, ratings inR=(rij)n×nwith 0<rij<1 can be regarded as cross ratios. In other words, these ratings are provided by the decision maker under a]0,1[-valued bipolar scale with the value 0.5 expressing the indifference between two alternatives, and rij/rjiis the ratio of the preference intensity for xito xj. If rij=0.5, one hasrijrji=rij1−rij=1, indicating that there is not difference between xiand xj. If the cross ratio rijsatisfies 0.5<rij<1, we haverijrji=rij1−rij>1, signifying that xiis superior to xjwith a ratiorijrji. If the cross ratio rijsatisfies 0<rij<0.5, thenrijrji=rij1−rij<1, showing that xiis non-preferred to xjwith a ratiorijrji.All pairwise ratings in reciprocal preference relations are given by numeric values. However, it is frequently unrealistic for decision makers to elicit such numeric ratings owing to complexity and indeterminacy of real decision making problems. In order to better characterize decision makers’ ratings with vagueness and indeterminacy, Xu [12] proposed the concept of IRPRs as follows.An IRPR on X is defined by an interval comparison matrixR¯=(r¯ij)n×n⊂X×Xsatisfying:(2.2)r¯ij=[rij−,rij+],0≤rij−≤rij+≤1,rij−+rji+=1,rii−=rii+=0.5,i,j=1,2,…,n.wherer¯ijrepresents the [0, 1]-valued interval rating of xiover xj.For two positive interval valuesr¯(1)=[r(1)−,r(1)+]andr¯(2)=[r(2)−,r(2)+], their arithmetic operations are summarized below.(1)Addition:r¯(1)+r¯(2)=[r(1)−+r(2)−,r(1)++r(2)+];Subtraction:r¯(1)−r¯(2)=[r(1)−−r(2)+,r(1)+−r(2)−];Multiplication:r¯(1)×r¯(2)=[r(1)−r(2)−,r(1)+r(2)+];Division:r¯(1)r¯(2)=r(1)−r(2)+,r(1)+r(2)−.On the basis of interval arithmetic, the additive reciprocity ofrij−+rji+=1,i,j=1,2,…,ncan be equivalently converted into the interval additive reciprocity ofr¯ji=1−r¯ij,i,j=1,2,…,n.For an IRPRR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=rij−,rij+n×nwith0<rij−≤rij+<1, we haver¯ijr¯ji=rij−rji+,rij+rji−, indicatingr¯ijr¯jiis an interval-valued ratio of the preference for xito xj. Asrij−=rij−/rji+1+rij−/rji+andrij+=rij+/rji−1+rij+/rji−, ratingsr¯ij=[rij−,rij+](i,j=1,2,…,n)in the IRPRR¯can be regarded as interval-valued cross ratios.For notational convenience, the set of all n×n IRPRs with interval-valued cross ratios is denoted as(2.3)ℜ¯=R¯=r¯ijn×n|r¯ij=[rij−,rij+],0<rij−≤rij+<1,rij−+rji+=1,rii−=rii+=0.5,i,j=1,2…,nA geometric consistency definition of IRPRs is given by Wang and Chen [29] as follows.LetR¯=(r¯ij)n×n=[rij−,rij+]n×n∈ℜ¯. IfR¯satisfies geometric transitivity:(2.4)rik−rki+rik+rki−=rij−rji+rij+rji−rjk−rkj+rjk+rkj−,i,j,k=1,2,…,nthenR¯is called geometrically consistent.In order to compare two [0, 1]-valued interval valuesr¯(1)=[r(1)−,r(1)+]andr¯(2)=[r(2)−,r(2)+], Xu and Chen [27] put forward a possibility degree formula as(2.5)P(r¯(1)≻r¯(2))=max1−maxr(2)+−r(1)−r(1)+−r(1)−+r(2)+−r(2)−,0,0Letr¯(1)=[r(1)−,r(1)+]andr¯(2)=[r(2)−,r(2)+]be any two [0, 1]-valued interval values. Ifr(1)−≤r(2)−andr(1)+≤r(2)+, thenr¯(1)andr¯(2)are said to have a relation denoted byr¯(1)≤r¯(2).By (2.5) and Definition 2.4, it is easy to prove thatP(r¯(1)≻r¯(2))≤0.5ifr¯(1)≤r¯(2).This section puts forward a formula to measure similarity between a pair of interval-valued cross ratios, and introduces ratio-based similarity measurements for IRPRs.Definition 3.1Letr¯(1)=[r(1)−,r(1)+]andr¯(2)=[r(2)−,r(2)+]be two interval-valued cross ratios, then a similarity index betweenr¯(1)andr¯(2)is defined as(3.1)Sr¯(1),r¯(2)=minr(1)−1−r(1)−,r(2)−1−r(2)−maxr(1)−1−r(1)−,r(2)−1−r(2)−minr(1)+1−r(1)+,r(2)+1−r(2)+maxr(1)+1−r(1)+,r(2)+1−r(2)+Eq. (3.1) can be equivalently expressed as the following expression.(3.2)Sr¯(1),r¯(2)=minr(1)−,r(2)−maxr(1)−,r(2)−1−maxr(1)−,r(2)−1−minr(1)−,r(2)−minr(1)+,r(2)+maxr(1)+,r(2)+1−maxr(1)+,r(2)+1−minr(1)+,r(2)+Obviously,0<Sr¯(1),r¯(2)≤1andSr¯(1),r¯(2)=Sr¯(2),r¯(1). The larger the value ofSr¯(1),r¯(2)is, the more similarr¯(1)is tor¯(2). In particular,Sr¯(1),r¯(2)=1if and only ifr¯(1)andr¯(2)are perfectly similar, i.e.,r¯(1)=r¯(2).Eq. (3.1) or (3.2) provides a way to measure similarity of any two interval-valued cross ratios. This measurement is established from the viewpoint of the ratio-based geometric mean. It is noted that Definition 3.1 differs from the notion of compatibility for two interval fuzzy values in [12], where the compatibility measurement is defined by the arithmetic average distance of endpoints of two intervals.Letr¯(l)=[r(l)−,r(l)+](l=1, 2) be any two interval-valued cross ratios, thenSr¯(1)C,r¯(2)C=Sr¯(1),r¯(2), wherer¯(l)Cis the complement ofr¯(l), i.e.,r¯(l)C=1−r¯(l)=[1−r(l)+,1−r(l)−].As per (3.2), we haveSr¯(1)C,r¯(2)C=min1−r(1)+,1−r(2)+max1−r(1)+,1−r(2)+1−max1−r(1)+,1−r(2)+1−min1−r(1)+,1−r(2)+×min1−r(1)−,1−r(2)−max1−r(1)−,1−r(2)−1−max1−r(1)−,1−r(2)−1−min1−r(1)−,1−r(2)−+=1−maxr(1)+,r(2)+1−minr(1)+,r(2)+minr(1)+,r(2)+maxr(1)+,r(2)+×1−maxr(1)−,r(2)−1−minr(1)−,r(2)−minr(1)−,r(2)−maxr(1)−,r(2)−=Sr¯(1),r¯(2)Thus, the proof of Theorem 3.1 is completed. ■Theorem 3.1 reveals that similarity of two complements is the same as that of their corresponding interval-valued cross ratios.Theorem 3.2Letr¯=[r−,r+]be an interval-valued cross ratio, then(3.3)Sr¯,r¯C=r−r+(1−r−)(1−r+),r−+r+≤1(1−r−)(1−r+)r−r+,Otherwisewherer¯Cis the complement ofr¯.If r−+r+≤1, we have r−≤1−r+ and 1−r−≥r+. Thus, one can obtainr−1−r−≤1−r+r+andr+1−r+≤1−r−r−. It follows from (3.1) thatSr¯,r¯C=S[r−,r+],[1−r+,1−r−]=minr−1−r−,1−r+r+maxr−1−r−,1−r+r+minr+1−r+,1−r−r−maxr+1−r+,1−r−r−=r−1−r−1−r+r+r+1−r+1−r−r−=r−r+(1−r−)(1−r+)Similarly, if r−+r+>1, one hasr−1−r−>1−r+r+andr+1−r+>1−r−r−. Then,Sr¯,r¯C=(1−r−)(1−r+)r−r+. ■Letr¯(l)=[r(l)−,r(l)+](l=1, 2, 3) be three interval-valued cross ratios. Ifr¯(1)≤r¯(2)≤r¯(3), thenSr¯(1),r¯(2)≥Sr¯(1),r¯(3).Asr¯(1)≤r¯(2)≤r¯(3), by Definition 2.4, we haver(1)−≤r(2)−≤r(3)−andr(1)+≤r(2)+≤r(3)+. It follows thatr(1)−1−r(1)−≤r(2)−1−r(2)−≤r(3)−1−r(3)−andr(1)+1−r(1)+≤r(2)+1−r(2)+≤r(3)+1−r(3)+. As per Definition 3.1, one can obtainSr¯(1),r¯(2)=r(1)−1−r(1)−r(2)−1−r(2)−r(1)+1−r(1)+r(2)+1−r(2)+≥r(1)−1−r(1)−r(3)−1−r(3)−r(1)+1−r(1)+r(3)+1−r(3)+=Sr¯(1),r¯(3).The proof of Theorem 3.3 is thus completed. ■Letr¯(l)=[r(l)−,r(l)+](l=1, 2) be any two interval-valued cross ratios satisfying1−as≤r(l)−≤r(l)+≤as, where 0.5≤as<1, then1−asas2≤Sr¯(1),r¯(2)≤1.Obviously, the inequalitySr¯(1),r¯(2)≤1holds. As1−as≤r(l)−≤r(l)+≤as, we have1−asas≤r(l)−1−r(l)−≤as1−asand1−asas≤r(l)+1−r(l)+≤as1−asfor l=1, 2. Thus, one can obtainminr(1)−1−r(1)−,r(2)−1−r(2)−≥1−asas,maxr(1)−1−r(1)−,r(2)−1−r(2)−≤as1−as,minr(1)+1−r(1)+,r(2)+1−r(2)+≥1−asasandmaxr(1)+1−r(1)+,r(2)+1−r(2)+≤as1−as. By (3.1), one hasSr¯(1),r¯(2)≥1−asas/as1−as=1−asas2.Therefore,1−asas2≤Sr¯(1),r¯(2)≤1. ■Theorem 3.4 indicates that if all interval-valued cross ratios are given under a bounded bipolar [1−as, as] scale with the neutral element 0.5, then the minimum value of similarity between any two of them is determined as1−asas2. On the other hand, if 1−as≤r−≤r+≤as, we have [1−as, 1−as]≤[r−, r+]≤[as, as]. Thus, interval-valued cross ratios [1−as, 1−as] and [as, as] are minimum and maximum elements for this bounded scale. By (3.3), one getsS[as,as],[1−as,1−as]=S[as,as],[as,as]C=1−asas2.There are two most commonly used bipolar scales with numerical values in representing DMs’ pairwise comparisons. One is based on the positive real line with the neutral value 1, and its grades are ratio-based values. The classical AHP and the fuzzy AHP with triangular fuzzy comparison matrices are based on a crisp-ratio scale such as Saaty's 1–9 scale. The other is based on the unit interval having the neutral element 0.5, and its grades are symmetrically distributed around 0.5. Unit-interval bipolar scales have been widely applied to decision making with [0, 1]-valued reciprocal preference relations. It should be noted that there exists an isomorphism between a crisp-ratio bipolar scale having the neutral element 1 and a unit-interval bipolar scale with the neutral value 0.5. For instance, a grade a based on Saaty's 1–9 scale can be converted into a [0.1, 0.9]-valued cross ratio a/(1+a). Under this transformation approach, a comparison matrix with Saaty's consistency is converted into a [0.1, 0.9]-valued reciprocal preference relation having Tanino's multiplicative consistency [42]. Therefore, a ratio-based bipolar 0.1–0.9 scale can be devised as shown in Table 1.Xia et al. [11] developed another bipolar 0.1–0.9 scale, and indicated the relation between their scale and Saaty's 1–9 scale. Under this 0.1–0.9 scale, one can easily verify that a pairwise comparison matrix with Saaty's consistency may be transformed into a [0.1, 0.9]-valued reciprocal preference relation having no Tanino's multiplicative consistency [42].If interval-valued cross ratiosr¯(l)=[r(l)−,r(l)+](l=1, 2) are provided under the ratio-based bipolar 0.1–0.9 scale, then we have as=0.9 and1/81≤Sr¯(1),r¯(2)≤1. Variations of similarity between interval-valued cross ratios and their complements are shown in Fig. 1.Definition 3.2LetR¯(1)=(r¯ij(1))n×n=([rij(1)−,rij(1)+])n×nandR¯(2)=(r¯ij(2))n×n=([rij(2)−,rij(2)+])n×nbe any two IRPRs inℜ¯, then(3.4)SrR¯(1),R¯(2)=∏i≠jS(r¯ij(1),r¯ij(2))1(n2−n)is called a ratio-based similarity index ofR¯(1)andR¯(2).It is noted that Definition 4.2 differs from the notions of compatibility for two IRPRs in [12,43]. The measurement formula by Xu [12] and Qian et al. [43] are established based on the sum of absolute deviations between all intervals in the two IRPRs and the mean absolute deviations between non-diagonal intervals inR¯(1)andR¯(2), respectively.Evidently, the greater the value ofSrR¯(1),R¯(2), the better the similarity betweenR¯(1)andR¯(2). By Theorem 3.1 and the reciprocal property of IRPRs, (3.4) can be equivalently rewritten asSrR¯(1),R¯(2)=∏i<jS(r¯ij(1),r¯ij(2))2(n2−n). As per (3.2), one can obtain(3.5)SrR¯(1),R¯(2)=∏i<jminrij(1)−,rij(2)−minrij(1)+,rij(2)+1−maxrij(1)−,rij(2)−1−maxrij(1)+,rij(2)+maxrij(1)−,rij(2)−maxrij(1)+,rij(2)+1−minrij(1)−,rij(2)−1−minrij(1)+,rij(2)+1(n2−n)By (3.5) and Theorems 3.1 and 3.4, the following properties can be directly derived for the ratio-based similarity indexSrR¯(1),R¯(2).Theorem 3.5LetSrR¯(1),R¯(2)be defined by (3.4), then(i)0<SrR¯(1),R¯(2)≤1;SrR¯(1),R¯(2)=1, if and only ifR¯(1)=R¯(2);SrR¯(1),R¯(2)=SrR¯(2),R¯(1);If the pairwise comparison ratings[rij(l)−,rij(l)+](i,j=1,2,…,n,l=1,2)inR¯(1)andR¯(2)satisfy1−as≤rij(l)−≤rij(l)+≤as, then1−asas2≤SrR¯(1),R¯(2)≤1.Property (i) indicates that the similarity indexSrR¯(1),R¯(2)lies in (0, 1]. Property (ii) means thatR¯(1)andR¯(2)are perfectly similar if and only ifSrR¯(1),R¯(2)=1. Property (iii) shows that the similarity indexSrR¯(1),R¯(2)has commutativity. Property (iv) reveals that if the judgments in IRPRs are provided under the bipolar [1−as, as] scale, then the similarity indexSrR¯(1),R¯(2)is bounded between1−asas2and 1. In particular, if IRPRsR¯(1)andR¯(2)are given under the ratio-based bipolar 0.1–0.9 scale, then one has1/81≤SrR¯(1),R¯(2)≤1.Definition 3.3Let trs(0<trs≤1) be a ratio-based similarity threshold, andR¯(1)andR¯(2)be two IRPRs inℜ¯. IfSrR¯(1),R¯(2)≥trs, thenR¯(1)andR¯(2)are said to have acceptable similarity; otherwise,R¯(1)andR¯(2)have no acceptable similarity.In some decision making problems, we need to consider the similarity level between one preference relation and others. Based on Definition 3.2, we establish a geometric-mean-based formula to measure the average similarity level between one IRPR and other IRPRs.LetR¯(l)=(r¯ij(l))n×n=([rij(l)−,rij(l)+])n×n(l=1,2,…,m)be m IRPRs inℜ¯, then a geometric-mean similarity index is defined as:(3.6)GMS(R¯(l))=∏k=1,k≠lmSr(R¯(l),R¯(k))m−1It is obvious that0<GMS(R¯(l))≤1. The larger the value ofGMS(R¯(l))is, the more proximate the IRPRR¯(l)is to the others. In particular, ifGMS(R¯(l))=1, thenR¯(l)=R¯(k)for all k=1, 2, …, m, i.e., all IRPRs are identical.Based on Definition 3.4, one can directly obtain the following result.Let trs(0<trs≤1) be a ratio-based similarity threshold, andR¯(l)(l=1,2,…,m)be m IRPRs inℜ¯. IfR¯(l)andR¯(k)have acceptable similarity, i.e.,Sr(R¯(l),R¯(k))≥trsfor all l, k=1, 2, …, m, thenGMS(R¯(l))≥trsfor all l=1, 2, …, m.In the process of solving GDM problems, we often need to aggregate individual preferences into a collective preference. This section develops some induced aggregation operators for fusing interval cross ratio information and aggregating individual IRPRs into a group IRPR, and puts forward their properties.Chiclana et al. [38] extended the ordered weighted geometric (OWG) operator [39] by using order inducing variables, and introduced the IOWG operator defined below.Definition 4.1[38]Let R+ be the positive real line. An IOWG operator is a functionIOWGω:(R+)m→R+with an associated weight vector ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωm)Tsuch that ωl∈[0, 1], l=1, 2, …, m and∑l=1mωl=1. The function IOWGωis expressed as:(4.1)IOWGωμ1,p1,μ2,p2,...,μm,pm=∏l=1mpσ(l)ωlwhere σ is a permutation of {1, …, m} such that μσ(l)≥μσ(l+1), for ∀l=1, 2, …, m−1.In Eq. (4.1), μland pl(l=1, 2, …, m) are often called order inducing values and argument values, respectively. (pσ(1), pσ(2), …, pσ(m)) is a reordering of (p1, p2, …, pm) as per the decreasing order of the order inducing values μl(l=1, 2, …, m).By (4.1), we haveIOWGωμ1,p1,μ2,p2,…,μm,pmIOWGωμ1,p1c,μ2,p2c,…,μm,pmc=1, for any ω and μl(l=1, 2, …, m), whereplcis the complement of pl, i.e.,plplc=1. In other words, ifplplc=1for all l=1, 2, …, m, then the aggregated valuesIOWGωμ1,p1,μ2,p2,…,μm,pmandIOWGωμ1,p1c,μ2,p2c,…,μm,pmchave multiplicative reciprocity. This result indicates the IOWG operator is suitable to aggregate Saaty's 1–9 scale based ratings in multiplicative preference relations. However, as per (2.2), ratings in IRPRs are interval-valued cross ratios and have no multiplicative reciprocity. Therefore, we cannot employ the IOWG operator to aggregate individual ratings for GDM problems with IRPRs.Chiclana et al. [8] employed the uninormxyxy+(1−x)(1−y)to convert equivalently Tanino's multiplicative transitivity equation [42] into a function expression with additive reciprocity. Motivated by this uninorm and the IOWG operator, we introduce the IIVCROWG operator as follows.Let(4.2)I¯]0,1[={[x−,x+]|0<x−≤x+<1}Definition 4.2An IIVCROWG operator of dimension m is a functionIIVCROWGω:I¯]0,1[m→I¯]0,1[defined by an associated weight vector ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωm)Twith ωl∈[0, 1], l=1, 2, …, m and∑l=1mωl=1, according to the following form:(4.3)IIVCROWGωμ1,r¯1,μ2,r¯2,…,μm,r¯m=IIVCROWGωμ1,[r1−,r1+],μ2,[r2−,r2+],…,μm,[rm−,rm+]=rω−,rω+=∏l=1mrσ(l)−ωl∏l=1mrσ(l)−ωl+∏l=1m1−rσ(l)−ωl,∏l=1mrσ(l)+ωl∏l=1mrσ(l)+ωl+∏l=1m1−rσ(l)+ωlwhere σ is a permutation of {1, …, m} satisfying μσ(l)≥μσ(l+1) for all l=1, 2, …, m−1.It is obvious that0<rω−,rω+<1. As0<rσ(l)−≤rσ(l)+<1for all l=1, 2, …, m, one can obtain1rσ(l)+−1≤1rσ(l)−−1. It follows that0<1rσ(l)+−1≤1rσ(l)−−1⇒1rσ(l)+−1ωl≤1rσ(l)−−1ωl⇒∏l=1m1rσ(l)+−1ωl≤∏l=1m1rσ(l)−−1ωl⇒∏l=1mrσ(l)−ωl∏l=1mrσ(l)−ωl+∏l=1m1−rσ(l)−ωl≤∏l=1mrσ(l)+ωl∏l=1mrσ(l)+ωl+∏l=1m1−rσ(l)+ωlThus, we have[rω−,rω+]∈I¯]0,1[.If ωl=1/m for all l=1, 2, …, m, then (4.3) is reduced to the interval-valued cross ratio geometric mean (IVCRGM) operator:(4.4)IVCRGMr¯1,r¯2,…,r¯m=IVCRGM[r1−,r1+],[r2−,r2+],…,[rm−,rm+]=∏l=1mrl−m∏l=1mrl−m+∏l=1m(1−rl−)m,∏l=1mrl+m∏l=1mrl+m+∏l=1m(1−rl+)mAs per (4.3), it is easy to verify that the IIVCROWG operator has commutativity and idempotency, which are described by the following two theorems.Theorem 4.1Commutativity(4.5)IIVCROWGωμ1,r¯1,μ2,r¯2,…,μm,r¯m=IIVCROWGωμ′1,r¯′1,μ′2,r¯′2,…,μ′m,r¯′mwhereμ′1,r¯′1,μ′2,r¯′2,…,μ′m,r¯′mis any permutation ofμ1,r¯1,μ2,r¯2,…,μm,r¯m.Ifr¯l=r¯for all l=1, 2, …, m, then(4.6)IIVCROWGωμ1,r¯1,μ2,r¯2,…μm,r¯m=r¯.Letr¯l=[rl−,rl+](l=1,2,…,m)be m interval-valued cross ratios, then(4.7)r¯min≤IIVCROWGωμ1,r¯1,μ2,r¯2,…,μm,r¯m≤r¯maxwherer¯min=min1≤l≤m{rl−},min1≤l≤m{rl+},r¯max=max1≤l≤m{rl−},max1≤l≤m{rl+}, and the implication of the “≤” is defined by Definition 2.4.Asmin1≤i≤m{ri−}≤rl−≤max1≤i≤m{ri−}andmin1≤i≤m{ri+}≤rl+≤max1≤i≤m{ri+}, we have1max1≤i≤m{ri−}−1≤1rl−−1≤1min1≤i≤m{ri−}−1and1max1≤i≤m{ri+}−1≤1rl+−1≤1min1≤i≤m{ri+}−1for all l=1, 2, …, m.

Therefore,rω−+rω+=1. Thus, we complete the proof of Theorem 4.5. ■Corollary 4.1 reveals that using the IIVCROWG operator yields an aggregated value [0.5, 0.5] if all argument values are equal to the neutral value [0.5, 0.5]. Theorem 4.5 further indicates that the aggregated result is determined as an indifference value with uncertainty if all of the midpoints of argument values are equal to 0.5.Theorem 4.6Letr¯l=[rl−,rl+](l=1,2,…,m)be m interval-valued cross ratios withr¯l∈I¯]0,1[, then(4.9)IIVCROWGωμ1,r¯1c,…,μm,r¯mc=1−IIVCROWGωμ1,r¯1,…,μm,r¯mwherer¯lcis the complement ofr¯l, i.e.,r¯lc=1−r¯lfor all l=1, 2, …, m.As per interval arithmetic described in Section 2, we haver¯lc=1−r¯l=[1−rl+,1−rl−]for all l=1, 2, …, m. By (4.3), one hasIIVCROWGωμ1,r¯1c,…,μm,r¯mc=∏l=1m1−rσ(l)+ωl∏l=1m1−rσ(l)+ωl+∏l=1mrσ(l)+ωl,∏l=1m1−rσ(l)−ωl∏l=1m1−rσ(l)−ωl+∏l=1mrσ(l)−ωl1−∏l=1mrσ(l)−ωl∏l=1mrσ(l)−ωl+∏l=1m1−rσ(l)−ωl,∏l=1mrσ(l)+ωl∏l=1mrσ(l)+ωl+∏l=1m1−rσ(l)+ωl=1−IIVCROWGωμ1,r¯1,…,μm,r¯mThus, the proof of Theorem 4.6 is completed. ■Theorem 4.6 reveals that the IIVCROWG operator is able to preserve the interval additive reciprocity for the argument valuesr¯landr¯lc(l=1,2,…,m)under any associated weight vector ω. Therefore, the IIVCROWG operator is suitable to aggregate individual interval-valued cross ratio ratings with the indifference expressed by [0.5, 0.5] into a collective preference.This subsection extends the IIVCROWG operator to fuse individual IRPRs into a group IRPR, and discusses the derivation of their associated weights.In some GDM cases, an importance degree can be assigned or determined to each IRPR (or decision maker). LetR¯(l)(l=1,2,…,m)be m IRPRs provided by a group of decision makers. Obviously, the greater the importance degree of the IRPRR¯(l), the stronger the action of the ratings inR¯(l)is to the resulting group IRPR. Therefore, the assigned importance degrees can be used to induce an order of the individual ratings.Based on the IIVCROWG operator, we introduce an ID-IIRPROWG operator to aggregate IRPRs as follows.Definition 4.3An ID-IIRPROWG operator of dimension m is a functionID-IIRPROWGω:ℜ¯m→ℜ¯defined as(4.10)ID-IIRPROWGωid1,R¯(1),id2,R¯(2),…,idm,R¯(m)=IIVCROWGωid1,r¯ij(1),id2,r¯ij(2),…,idm,r¯ij(m)n×n=∏l=1mrij(σ(l))−ωl∏l=1mrij(σ(l))−ωl+∏l=1m1−rij(σ(l))−ωl,∏l=1mrij(σ(l))+ωl∏l=1mrij(σ(l))+ωl+∏l=1m1−rij(σ(l))+ωln×nwhere idl(l=1, 2, …, m) are importance degrees of the m IRPRsR¯(l)=(r¯ij(l))n×n=([rij(l)−,rij(l)+])n×n, and σ is a permutation of {1, …, m} such that idσ(l)≥idσ(l+1) for all l=1, 2, …, m−1.It can seen from (4.10) that the associated weights are determined once for the entire aggregation process of the m IRPRsR¯(l)(l=1,2,…,m). In this process, it is required that the stronger the importance of an IRPR, the greater the associated weight of the IRPR. In other words, the associated weight vector ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωm)Tin (4.10) should satisfy(4.11)idσ(1)≥idσ(2)≥⋯≥idσ(m)⇒ωσ(1)≥ωσ(2)≥⋯≥ωσ(m)Obviously, ifR¯(1)=R¯(2)=⋯=R¯(m), thenID-IIRPROWGωid1,R¯(1),id2,R¯(2),…,idm,R¯(m)=R¯(1)for any associated weight vector ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωm)T. If ωl=1/m for all l=1, 2, …, m, then (4.10) is reduced to the IRPR geometric mean (IRPRGM) operator:(4.12)IRPRGMR¯(1),R¯(2),…,R¯(m)=∏l=1mrij(l)−m∏l=1mrij(l)−m+∏l=1m(1−rij(l)−)m,∏l=1mrij(l)+m∏l=1mrij(l)+m+∏l=1m(1−rij(l)+)mn×nTheorem 4.7LetR¯(l)=(r¯ij(l))n×n=([rij(l)−,rij(l)+])n×n(l=1,2,…,m)be m IRPRs inℜ¯andR¯g=(r¯ijg)n×n=([rij−g,rij+g])n×n=ID-IIRPROWGωid1,R¯(1),id2,R¯(2),...,idm,R¯(m)be defined by (4.10). If allR¯(l)(l=1,2,...,m)have geometric consistency, thenR¯ghas geometric consistency.AsR¯(l)(l=1,2,...,m)are all geometrically consistent, by (2.4), we haverik(l)−rki(l)+rik(l)+rki(l)−=rij(l)−rji(l)+rij(l)+rji(l)−rjk(l)−rkj(l)+rjk(l)+rkj(l)−,i,j,k=1,2,…,n,l=1,2,…,m.Thus, for any normalized weight vector ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωm)Tand i, j, k=1, 2, …, n,∏l=1mrik(σ(l))−ωl∏l=1mrki(σ(l))+ωl∏l=1mrik(σ(l))+ωl∏l=1mrki(σ(l))−ωl=∏l=1mrij(σ(l))−ωl∏l=1mrji(σ(l))+ωl∏l=1mrij(σ(l))+ωl∏l=1mrji(σ(l))−ωl∏l=1mrjk(σ(l))−ωl∏l=1mrkj(σ(l))+ωl∏l=1mrjk(σ(l))+ωl∏l=1mrkj(σ(l))−ωl, where σ is a permutation of {1, …, m}.As per (4.10) and the interval additive reciprocity of IRPRs, one can obtainrij−grji+g=∏l=1mrij(σ(l))−ωl∏l=1mrji(σ(l))+ωl+∏l=1m1−rji(σ(l))+ωl∏l=1mrij(σ(l))−ωl+∏l=1m1−rij(σ(l))−ωl∏l=1mrji(σ(l))+ωl=∏l=1mrij(σ(l))−ωl∏l=1mrji(σ(l))+ωl,i,j=1,2,…,n.It follows thatrik−grki+grik+grki−g=rij−grji+grij+grji−grjk−grkj+grjk+grkj−g,i,j,k=1,2,…,n. By Definition 2.3,R¯ghas geometric consistency. ■Consider the following two IRPRs:R¯(1)=[0.5,0.5][1/2,2/3][2/3,6/7][1/3,1/2][0.5,0.5][2/3,3/4][1/7,1/3][1/4,1/3][0.5,0.5]R¯(2)=[0.5,0.5][2/3,3/4][2/3,6/7][1/4,1/3][0.5,0.5][1/2,2/3][1/7,1/3][1/3,1/2][0.5,0.5]It is easy to verify thatR¯(1)andR¯(2)satisfy the geometric transitivity (2.4). Thus,R¯(1)andR¯(2)have geometric consistency.Assume that the two IRPRs have the same importance, i.e., ω1=ω2=0.5. As per (4.10) or (4.12), the aggregated IRPR is determined asR¯g=[0.5,0.5]21+2,61+6[2/3,6/7]11+2,11+6[0.5,0.5]21+2,61+6[1/7,1/3]11+2,11+6[0.5,0.5]One can easily verify thatR¯gsatisfies (2.4). By Definition 2.3, the aggregated IRPRR¯ghas geometric consistency.Tapia Garcia et al. [34] employed the weighted arithmetic mean operator to aggregate individual IRPRs. By using this approach, the aggregated IRPR is obtained asR¯TG=rij−TG,rij+TG3×3=[0.5,0.5][7/12,17/24][2/3,6/7][5/12,7/24][0.5,0.5][7/12,17/24][1/7,1/3][5/12,7/24][0.5,0.5]Asr13−TGr31+TGr13+TGr31−TG=12≠1752=r12−TGr21+TGr12+TGr21−TGr23−TGr32+TGr23+TGr32−TG,R¯TGdoes not satisfy (2.4). Therefore, the aggregated IRPRR¯TGis not geometrically consistent.Example 1 shows that the consistency level of the aggregated IRPR is reduced by using the weighted arithmetic mean operators of IRPRs, implying the weighted arithmetic based aggregation operators are not flexible enough for fusing IRPRs. Theorem 4.7 indicates that the aggregated IRPR by using IIVCROWG based operators has geometric consistency if all individual IRPRs are geometrically consistent. Therefore, it is suitable to use the IIVCROWG based operators to aggregate individual IRPRs into a group IRPR from the viewpoint of geometric consistency.One important issue in applying IIVCROWG based aggregation operators is to obtain their associated weight vector ω. Many methods have been developed to derive associated weights for ordered weighted aggregation operators. Yager [44] put forward an approach to evaluate associated weights based on a linguistic quantifier, which was extended to the case of the induced ordered weighted fusion operators by Chiclana et al. [37] as follows.(4.13)ωl=Qμσ(1)T,l=1Q∑k=1lμσ(k)T−Q∑k=1l−1μσ(k)T,l=2,3,…,mwhereT=∑k=1mμσ(k), and the quantifier Q is a strictly increasing fuzzy linguistic quantifier with a membership function such that Q:[0, 1]→[0, 1] and Q(0)=0, Q(1)=1.In order to employ (4.13) to generate the associated weight vector that satisfies (4.11), the quantifier Q should verify [37](4.14)Q∑k=1lμσ(k)T−Q∑k=1l−1μσ(k)T≥Q∑k=1l+1μσ(k)T−Q∑k=1lμσ(k)TA number of fuzzy linguistic quantifiers are developed in the current literature. Especially, Yager [44] devised a fuzzy linguistic quantifier Q with a parameter α as Q(x)=xa, where a>0. Chiclana et al. [37] pointed out that the function Q(x)=xadoes not verify (4.14) if a>1, and proved that Q(x)=xawith 0≤a≤1 is sufficient to verify (4.14). Based on this idea, (4.13) can be converted to the following formula for obtaining associated weights of ID-IIRPROWG operator.(4.15)ωl=idσ(1)∑k=1midσ(k)α,l=1∑k=1lidσ(k)∑k=1midσ(k)α−∑k=1l−1idσ(k)∑k=1midσ(k)α,l=2,3,…,mwhere 0≤a≤1.For the largest weight ω1 defined by (4.15), we have(4.16)dω1dα=idσ(1)∑k=1midσ(k)αlnidσ(1)∑k=1midσ(k)<0It can be seen from (4.16) that ω1 determined by (4.15) is a decreasing function in α. If a=0 in (4.15), then (4.10) is reduced to the maximum importance based aggregation method for IRPRs. The lower the a value, the closer the ID-IIRPROWG operator is to the aggregation method based on maximum importance. This result indicates that the parameter α value should be set to be close to zero if one wants to highlight ratings in the IRPRs with high importance. If a=1 in (4.15), then (4.10) is degraded to the normalized importance based aggregation method for IRPRs. The greater the a value, the nearer the ID-IIRPROWG operator is to the normalized-importance based aggregation approach. This result reveals that the α value should be selected to be near to unity if we expect that the sum of deviations between the two obtained weights,∑l=1m−1(ωl−ωl+1), is not too big. If a=0.5 in (4.15), then the aggregation method by applying the ID-IIRPROWG operator is based on the fuzzy linguistic majority “most of”.If the importance of each IRPR is unknown, then the importance degrees idl(l=1, 2, …, m) of the ID-IIRPROWG operator should be determined in the process of solving GDM problems.For m IRPRsR¯(l)(l=1,2,…,m), as per (3.6), ifGMS(R¯(l))=1, then the m IRPRsR¯(l)(l=1,2,…,m)are the same, indicating all decision makers provide the same judgment. In this case, the resulting group IRPR should be the same as the IRPRR¯(l). The larger theGMS(R¯(l)), the more contribution theR¯(l)is to the group consensus, meaning that the associated weight ofR¯(l)should be assigned to be large. Therefore, the geometric-mean similarity index ofR¯(l)can be employed to determine the importance degrees idlof the ID-IIRPROWG operator for aggregating m IRPRsR¯(l)(l=1,2,…,m). That is,idl=GMS(R¯(l))for l=1, 2, …, m. In this case, by (4.15), the associated weights of ID-IIRPROWG operator are determined as(4.17)ωl=GMS(R¯(σ(1)))∑k=1mGMS(R¯(σ(k)))α,l=1∑k=1lGMS(R¯(σ(k)))∑k=1mGMS(R¯(σ(k)))α−∑k=1l−1GMS(R¯(σ(k)))∑k=1mGMS(R¯(σ(k)))α,l=2,3,…,mwhere 0≤a≤1.This section proposes an approach to generating feedback recommendation rules, and develops a similarity and IICROWG based consensus model for GDM with IRPRs.A group IRPR,R¯g=(r¯ijg)n×n=([rij−g,rij+g])n×n, is derived from individual IRPRsR¯(l)(l=1,2,…,m)by using the ID-IIRPROWG operator. As per Definition 3.2,SrR¯(l),R¯gcaptures the ratio-based similarity level betweenR¯(l)andR¯g. In other words, the consensus of individual ratings can be measured bySrR¯(l),R¯g(l=1,2,…,m). If the individual IRPRR¯(l)andR¯ghas acceptable similarity under Definition 3.3 for all l=1, 2, …, m, then there exists a consensus among the opinions given by the decision makers. If there exits one of the IRPRs,R¯(l0), with low similarity indexSrR¯(l0),R¯g, i.e.,R¯(l0)andR¯ghas no acceptable similarity, thenR¯(l0)should be returned to the decision maker for a restatement. In this case, it is logical to generate feedback information to the decision maker for updating the ratings inR¯(l0).As per (3.4), we have(5.1)SrR¯(l0),R¯g=∏i<jS(r¯ij(l0),r¯ijg)2(n2−n)Let(5.2)ΩR¯(l0)R¯g=(i,j)|i<j,S(r¯ij(l0),r¯ijg)<trswhere trs(0<trs≤1) is a ratio-based similarity threshold.By (5.1), it is easy to prove thatΩR¯(l0)R¯gis nonempty ifSrR¯(l0),R¯g<trs. In other words, if the similarity betweenR¯(l0)andR¯gis unacceptable, then there exists at least one ratingr¯i0j0(l0)(i0,j0)∈ΩR¯(l0)R¯gthat is contributing less to the acceptable consensus. Therefore,ΩR¯(l0)R¯gcan be used to identify the ratings that should be updated, and generate recommendation rules.Let(5.3)SrR¯(l*),R¯g=maxl=1,2,…,mSrR¯(l),R¯gThen, the similarity level betweenR¯(l*)and the group IRPRR¯gis the largest amongSrR¯(l),R¯g(l=1,2,…,m). Accordingly, a set of recommendation rules can be obtained as(5.4)ΘR¯(l0)=<(i0,j0),r¯i0j0(l0)→r¯i0j0*>|(i0,j0)∈ΩR¯(l0)R¯gwherer¯i0j0*is the (i0, j0) element of the IRPRR¯(l*).On the basis of the aforesaid analysis, a consensus procedure is devised as follows.Step 1. Consider a GDM problem with a set of alternatives X={x1, x2, …, xn} and a group of decision makers D={d1, d2, …, dm}, each decision maker dl(l=1, 2, …, m) compares pairs of the alternatives in X and furnishes his/her interval cross ratio ratings by means of an IRPRR¯(l)=(r¯ij(l))n×n=([rij(l)−,rij(l)+])n×n.Step 2. If the importance of the m decision makers is known, then the group IRPRR¯gis determined asR¯g=ID-IIRPROWGωid1,R¯(1),id2,R¯(2),…,idm,R¯(m), where idlis the importance degree of the decision maker dlfor each l=1, 2, …, m, and ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωm)Tis determined as per (4.15); otherwise, letidl=GMS(R¯(l))for all l=1, 2, …, m, andR¯g=ID-IIRPROWGωid1,R¯(1),id2,R¯(2),…,idm,R¯(m), where ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωm)Tis calculated by using (4.17).Step 3. Utilize (3.5) to compute the ratio-based similarity indexSrR¯(l),R¯gfor all individual IRPRsR¯(l)(l=1,2,...,m).Step 4.

End.This section presents two examples to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed consensus model. The first example is a GDM problem concerning a selection of international exchange graduate students (adapted from Wang and Li [30]). The second example is an investment GDM problem where decision makers’ importance weights are completely unknown.Example 2Recent years have witnessed a rapid internationalization trend in the Chinese higher education sector. Different funding agencies have been sponsoring an increasing number of promising graduate students and young scholars to conduct collaborative research and studies abroad. Assume that a selection committee consisting of four experts (i.e., decision makers) d1, d2, d3 and d4 is set up to evaluate four applications x1, x2, x3 and x4. The importance degree vector of the four decision makers are given as (1.2, 1.8, 1, 2)T. Since the four experts may not be very familiar with the four graduate students, their pairwise judgments have subjectivity and uncertainty. Hence, based on the ratio-based bipolar 0.1–0.9 scale shown in Table 1, each decision maker dl(l=1, 2, 3, 4) gives his/her judgments by means of an IRPRR¯(l)=(r¯ij(l))4×4=([rij(l)−,rij(l)+])4×4as follows.R¯(1)=[0.5,0.5][0.3,0.5][0.2,0.5][0.6,0.8][0,5,0.7][0.5,0.5][0.2,0.3][0.4,0.7][0.5,0.8][0.7,0.8][0.5,0.5][0.5,0.7][0.2,0.4][0.3,0.6][0.3,0.5][0.5,0.5]R¯(2)=[0.5,0.5][0.3,0.4][0.4,0.5][0.3,0.5][0,6,0.7][0.5,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.5,0.7][0.5,0.6][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.5][0.3,0.5][0.5,0.7][0.3,0.5][0.5,0.7][0.5,0.5]R¯(3)=[0.5,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.6,0.8][0.4,0.6][0,4,0.5][0.5,0.5][0.6,0.7][0.5,0.6][0.2,0.4][0.3,0.4][0.5,0.5][0.3,0.4][0.4,0.6][0.4,0.5][0.6,0.7][0.5,0.5]R¯(4)=[0.5,0.5][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.6,0.7][0,5,0.6][0.5,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.7,0.8][0.4,0.5][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.3,0.4][0.2,0.3][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.5]By using the importance degrees, one has σ(1)=4, σ(2)=2, σ(3)=1 and σ(4)=3 for the ID-IIRPROWG operator. As per (4.15) at α=0.5 representing the fuzzy linguistic majority “most of”, one can obtain the associated weights ω1=0.58, ω2=0.22, ω3=0.12 and ω4=0.08. By applying the ID-IIRPROWG operator, the group IRPR is determined asR¯g=[0.5,0.5][0.3721,0.4858][0.4445,0.5857][0.5162,0.6660][0,5142,0.6279][0.5,0.5][0.4666,0.5721][0.6089,0.7548][0.4143,0.5555][0.4279,0.5334][0.5,0.5][0.4368,0.5755][0.3340,0.4838][0.2452,0.3911][0.4245,0.5632][0.5,0.5]Using (3.5), we have ratio-based similarity indicesSrR¯(1),R¯g=0.7057,SrR¯(2),R¯g=0.8060,SrR¯(3),R¯g=0.7661andSrR¯(4),R¯g=0.8844.To calibrate the proposed model, assume that the similarity acceptable threshold is set to be no less than 0.75, i.e., trs=0.75. Then,R¯(1)is unacceptable from the view of the group consensus, and should be returned to the decision maker d1 together with recommendation rules for a restatement.As per (5.2) and (5.3), we haveΩR¯(1)R¯g={(1,2),(2,3),(2,4)}andR¯(l*)=R¯(4), By employing (5.4), the recommendation rule set is generated asΘR¯(1)=〈(1,2),[0.3,0.5]→[0.4,0.5]〉,〈(2,3),[0.2,0.3]→[0.5,0.6]〉,〈(2,4),[0.4,0.7]→[0.7,0.8]〉If the decision maker d1 implements the recommended ratings, then the second round group IRPR is generated asR¯srg=[0.5,0.5][0.3846,0.4858][0.4445,0.5857][0.5162,0.6660][0,5142,0.6154][0.5,0.5][0.5081,0.6085][0.6441,0.7666][0.4143,0.5555][0.3915,0.4919][0.5,0.5][0.4368,0.5755][0.3340,0.4838][0.2334,0.3559][0.4245,0.5632][0.5,0.5]By (3.5), new ratio-based similarity indices between the second round IRPRs andR¯srgwould be 0.8388, 0.7991, 0.7705 and 0.9072, respectively. They are all more than the similarity acceptable threshold. Therefore, next, the group IRPRR¯srgwill be used to derive a ranking order of the four applications.According to (5.5), we obtain the overall preference degrees of the four applications as follows.r¯x1=[0.4608,0.5609],r¯x2=[0.5425,0.6283],r¯x3=[0.4353,0.5309],r¯x4=[0.3668,0.4748].Based on the possibility formula (2.5), one can getPM=0.50.09900.64180.93270.90100.5110.358200.50.80600.067300.19400.5As per (5.6), we have η1=2.1735, η2=3.4010, η3=1.6642, η4=0.7613, and the four applications are ranked asx2≻90.1%x1≻64.18%x3≻86.6%x4.Let us consider a GDM problem concerning an investment selection. An investment company wants to invest a sum of money in the best option, and provides four possible alternatives x1: An arms company, x2: A food company, x3: A car company and x4: A computer company. Four decision makers d1, d2, d3 and d4 are asked to evaluate the four alternatives, and provide their judgments listed in the following IRPRsR¯(l)=(r¯ij(l))4×4=([rij(l)−,rij(l)+])4×4(l=1,2,3,4).R¯(1)=[0.5,0.5][0.8,0.9][0.5,0.6][0.7,0.8][0,1,0.2][0.5,0.5][0.2,0.3][0.3,0.4][0.4,0.5][0.7,0.8][0.5,0.5][0.6,0.7][0.2,0.3][0.6,0.7][0.2,0.3][0.5,0.5]R¯(2)=[0.5,0.5][0.7,0.8][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.6][0,2,0.3][0.5,0.5][0.2,0.3][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.7,0.8][0.5,0.5][0.6,0.7][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.3,0.4][0.5,0.5]R¯(3)=[0.5,0.5][0.6,0.7][0.7,0.8][0.5,0.6][0,3,0.4][0.5,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.4,0.5][0.2,0.3][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.5][0.2,0.3][0.4,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.7,0.8][0.5,0.5]R¯(4)=[0.5,0.5][0.5,0.6][0.4,0.5][0.7,0.8][0,4,0.5][0.5,0.5][0.3,0.4][0.5,0.6][0.5,0.6][0.6,0.7][0.5,0.5][0.7,0.8][0.2,0.3][0.4,0.5][0.2,0.3][0.5,0.5]Assume that the importance of each decision maker is unknown and trs=0.70. In this situation, decision makers’ importance weights are usually considered to be equal. However, in this manner, each IRPR can always have an index associated to it. This index often captures the quality of the decision maker's rating data for the group consensus, such as the geometric-mean similarity index of the individual IRPR.For the four IRPRsR¯(l)(l=1,2,3,4), by (3.6), geometric-mean similarity indices are respectively computed as:GMS(R¯(1))=0.7136,GMS(R¯(2))=0.7536,GMS(R¯(3))=0.6209,GMS(R¯(4))=0.7029.AsGMS(R¯(2))>GMS(R¯(1))>GMS(R¯(4))>GMS(R¯(3)), we have σ(1)=2, σ(2)=1, σ(3)=4 and σ(4)=3 for the ID-IIRPROWG operator. As per (4.17), one can obtain different associated weights by setting different α values. Variations of associated weights and the difference∑i=13(ωi−ωi+1)=ω1−ω4are shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2 indicates that the associated weight ω1 and the difference ω1−ω4 are decreasing functions in α, but the associated weight ω4 is an increasing function in α. The smaller the α value, the larger the value∑i=13(ωi−ωi+1)=ω1−ω4. Therefore, here, α=0.9 is considered to ensure that the sum of the differences is not too large, and the associated weights are determined as ω1=0.31, ω2=0.25, ω3=0.24 and ω4=0.20.Letidl=GMS(R¯(l))for all l=1, 2, 3, 4, by using the ID-IIRPROWG operator, the group IRPR is obtained asR¯g=[0.5,0.5][0.6660,0.7766][0.4866,0.5935][0.6023,0.7081][0,2234,0.3340][0.5,0.5][0.2730,0.3797][0.3968,0.4990][0.4065,0.5134][0.6203,0.7270][0.5,0.5][0.5382,0.6542][0.2919,0.3977][0.5010,0.6032][0.3159,0.4345][0.5,0.5]As per (3.5), we obtainSrR¯(1),R¯g=0.8277,SrR¯(2),R¯g=0.8754,SrR¯(3),R¯g=0.7082andSrR¯(4),R¯g=0.7972. Obviously, they are all larger than the similarity acceptable threshold trs=0.70. Thus, the following overall preference degrees of the four alternatives are obtained as per (5.5).r¯x1=[0.5653,0.6520],r¯x2=[0.3405,0.4265],r¯x3=[0.5166,0.6029],r¯x4=[0.3980,0.4838]According to (2.5), one can construct the possibility matrix asPM=0.510.7827100.500.16590.217310.5100.834100.5Using (5.6) yields η1=3.2827, η2=0.6659, η3=2.7173, η4=1.3341. Therefore, we havex1≻78.27%x3≻100%x4≻83.41%x2, and the arms company is the best investment alternative.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
An IRPR is an important framework used to express a decision maker's indeterminate rating information. Similarity and aggregation of IRPRs play key roles for the group consensus building. This paper has proposed ratio-based similarity measurements for interval-valued cross ratios and IRPRs, and explored their properties. To effectively aggregate individual IRPRs, we have developed the IIVCROWG operator and shown that it has commutativity, boundary, monotonicity, and idempotency as well as interval additive reciprocity. An IIVCROWG based aggregation operator, the ID-IIRPROWG operator, has been proposed and used to fuse individual IRPRs into a group IRPR. A similarity measurement and IIVCROWG operator based consensus model with a feedback generation has been devised to solve GDM problems where decision makers’ importance weights may be unknown. Numerical examples have been furnished to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed consensus procedure.Current research considers that IRPRs given by decision makers are complete and have enough consistency levels. In the future, we will apply the developed ratio-based similarity measurements and aggregation operators to the situation where original ratings are incomplete and may be too inconsistent.
