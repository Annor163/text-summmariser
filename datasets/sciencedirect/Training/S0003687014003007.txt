@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Nowadays, the majority of jobs in the western world involves sitting in an office chair. As a result, a comfortable and supported sitting position is essential for employees. In the literature, various objective methods (e.g. pressure measurements, measurements of posture, EMG etc.) have been used to assess sitting comfort/discomfort, but their validity remains unknown. This review therefore examines the relationship between subjective comfort/discomfort and pressure measurements while sitting in office chairs.The literature search resulted in eight papers that met all our requirements. Four studies identified a relationship between subjective comfort/discomfort and pressure distribution parameters (including correlations of up to r = 0.7 ± 0.13). However, the technique for evaluating subjective comfort/discomfort seems to play an important role on the results achieved, therefore placing their validity into question.The peak pressure on the seat pan, the pressure distribution on the backrest and the pressure pattern changes (seat pan and backrest) all appear to be reliable measures for quantifying comfort or discomfort.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In modern societies, increasing amounts of time are spent in a seated position. Reinecke et al. (2002) and Treaster and Marras (1987) reported that approximately 75% of all employees in industrial countries have jobs that require them to work in a seated position. Low back pain (LBP) is particularly common, and almost everyone experiences it at one time or another (Hoy et al., 2010). A study by McBeth and Jones (2007) showed that approximately one-third of western populations suffered from LBP in the course of any given month. An increasing number of employees with back pain is clearly associated with the increasing number of day's sick leave. Here, Holtermann et al. (2010) analysed a group of Danish employees (N = 5036) in 2000 and found that approximately one-fifth of the employees who had neck-shoulder and LBP experienced long-term sick leave within the following two years. Videman et al. (1990) reported that either heavy or sedentary work is associated with a higher risk of developing back pain compared to occupations with mixed seating and loading regimes. Furthermore, low levels of seating comfort often lead to musculoskeletal complaints such as LBP (Vink and Hallbeck, 2012). Therefore, employers should be aware of the importance of providing a comfortable working environment for their employees to ensure their health and welfare (De Looze et al., 2003). Moreover, seated workers who suffer from discomfort are inefficient and error prone (Hertzberg, 1958). As a result, Christiansen (1997) concluded that users' subjective seating comfort is the decisive criterion that should guide purchase decisions. Despite the popular opinion, as described above, that occupational sitting is highly associated with LBP, several current literature reviews revealed that sedentary lifestyle by itself does not increase the risk of LBP (Hartvigsen et al., 2000; Kwon et al., 2011; Lis et al., 2007; Roffey et al., 2010). However, Lis et al. (2007) emphasised that the combination of sitting for longer than half a day in an awkward posture and/or with whole body vibration is capable of increasing the likelihood of suffering from LBP.Seating comfort/discomfort is based on a subjective sensation and thus is difficult to quantify. There are three main methods upon which it is possible to gain an indication of the level of sitting comfort and discomfort (Vergara and Page, 2002): anthropometry, subjective assessment and objective measurements. Vergara and Page (2002) reported that subjective evaluation is the only way to determine changes in comfort and pain, based on self-reported questionnaires including the “general comfort rating”, the “body area comfort rating”, the “method of adjustment”, the “Chair Feature Checklist” or “personal comments” (Christiansen, 1997; Shackel et al., 1969). However, the use of subjective evaluations presents difficulties in terms of quantitative measurement versus interpretation (Branton, 1969; Helander et al., 1987). Firstly, chair users must be aware of their comfort/discomfort. It is more difficult to sense varying degrees of comfort compared to varying degrees of discomfort. Secondly, individuals may have difficulty verbalising their feelings of comfort/discomfort. Furthermore, a source of comfort or discomfort may be very difficult to associate with a specific design feature of a chair. Finally, it is difficult to memorise the sensation of comfort/discomfort, which is a necessary requirement for the comparison of different chairs.It has been shown that the design of an office chair is able to strongly influence the sitting conditions for the user. Dreischarf et al. (2010) reported that spinal loading can be reduced by supporting the upper body using an armrest. The seat pan and backrest cushion properties can also play a decisive role on the chair-user interaction. For example, Mooney et al. (1971) observed an almost 50% reduction in the mean seat pressure in a wheelchair due to a different cushion. Furthermore, Bendix et al. (1996) highlighted the importance of the shape of the backrest, since it can influence lumbar lordosis as well as spinal loading. Similarly, Coleman et al. (1998) stressed the importance of adjustable lumbar support in order to provide a comfortable seat. Besides the office chair design, human factors also play an important role in terms of the loading conditions on the human body. Here, for example Nachemson (1976) showed the influence of different sitting positions on the pressure in the third lumbar disc. Andersson et al. (1974) and Andersson and Ortengren (1974) reported that the disc pressure of the third lumbar disc decreases while reclining backwards with the backrest. More recent studies highlighted the influence of upright and reclined (Zemp et al., 2013) as well as forward inclined (Baumgartner et al., 2012) sitting on the shape of the spine by means of open MRI measurements.There are several definitions and models of comfort and discomfort available in the literature that are presented in this section. The aim of this review is to analyse the degree to which comfort/discomfort provided by chairs can be quantified, and not the feelings of comfort and/or discomfort experienced by a person. For the purpose of the current study, chair users act as channels of information about chairs (Branton, 1969). Several factors influence feelings of comfort/discomfort (Vink et al., 2005); Personal factors include the user's physical and psychological state as well as the history of the user's comfort/discomfort experience. External stimuli, such as visual input, smell, noise, temperature, humidity, pressure/touch, posture and movement, can also form an important part of the evaluation of comfort/discomfort. Thus, comfort/discomfort can be divided into visual comfort/discomfort (Kooi and Toet, 2004), thermal comfort/discomfort (Cena and de Dear, 2001), olfactory comfort/discomfort (Kempski, 2005), and so on. Sitting comfort/discomfort is a combination of these factors. In particular, external stimuli of pressure and touch play a decisive role (De Looze et al., 2003; Mergl, 2006; Verver, 2004).According to Richards (1980), “Comfort is a continuous dimension of experience — varying from strongly positive (very comfortable) to strongly negative (very uncomfortable). It involves a transition region which would be described as neither comfortable nor uncomfortable, but neutral. … Comfort depends on multiple physical inputs and discomfort may arise from any of several causes.” Hertzberg (1958) did not define comfort and discomfort as two distinct states of consciousness. Instead, he reported that there is only “discomfort” because “comfort” is only the absence of discomfort. Hence, it is not possible to provide comfort; it is only possible to eliminate the source of discomfort. Branton (1969) adopted a similar point of view concerning the definition of comfort, suggesting that comfort varies along a continuum ranging from a state of indifference to a state of extreme discomfort. He noted that it is very difficult to envisage deriving extreme feelings of well-being while sitting in a chair, regardless of how comfortable the chair may be. Despite this, some studies have attempted to measure degrees of positive comfort (Oborne, 1978). Branton (1969) reported that the absence of discomfort is synonymous with a state of no awareness of sensation and does not necessarily represent a positive sensation. Similarly, the absence of pain does not automatically imply the presence of pleasure. However, more recent studies contradict prior definitions. For example, Kleeman (1981) and Kamijo et al. (1982) reported that comfort and discomfort are influenced by different variables. Zhang et al. (1996) proposed a model of discomfort and comfort as two different entities (Fig. 1). Discomfort, in this model, is related to biomechanical factors that lead to pain, tiredness, soreness and numbness, whereas comfort relates to well-being and the aesthetic impression of the chair (Helander and Zhang, 1997; Zhang et al., 1996). The intersection of the axes represents the possible transition from discomfort to comfort and vice versa. For example, if the discomfort is low, comfort can be experienced. Conversely, if comfort is reduced, discomfort may be enhanced. The influence of the aesthetic appeal on the comfort experience, at least during the first encounter with a chair, was demonstrated by Knoll (2006), who noted that the haptic impression prevails over time; thus, the physical characteristics of the chair become increasingly important.Based on the model by Zhang et al. (1996), Paul (1997) highlighted the need for different strategies in ergonomic interventions to reduce discomfort (nurturing) and increase comfort (pampering). Nurturing designates a strategy that aims to decrease discomfort by promoting an active and dynamic use of the body during the workday to maintain health. Pampering is a comfort strategy that concentrates on enhancing comfort through aesthetics and plush environments. Many other studies (Andreoni et al., 2002; Goossens et al., 2005; Kyung and Nussbaum, 2008; Mehta and Tewari, 2000) refer to the comfort/discomfort model of Zhang et al. (1996). However, the concept of comfort and discomfort remains a controversial topic, and there is no generally accepted definition (De Looze et al., 2003; Pearson, 2009). Nevertheless, three issues are clear: comfort is a construct of a subjectively defined personal nature; comfort is affected by factors of various types (physical, physiological, psychological); and comfort is a reaction to the environment (De Looze et al., 2003).A frequently cited comfort/discomfort model in literature is the model by De Looze et al. (2003). This model describes the interaction of the different factors influencing comfort and discomfort while dividing them into three categories: human, product and environment (Fig. 2). Moes (2005) introduced a new model in order to explain the process of discomfort sensation during sitting. The initial parameters of this model are the person, the seat, the purpose and the usage. Moes (2005) described four steps in the model until finally discomfort is experienced (I → E → P → A → D). The first step is the occurrence of an interaction (I) between the person and the seat with a specific purpose that results in internal body effects (E). These effects may then be perceived and interpreted (P). The next step is the appreciation of the perception (A). Finally, if the internal body effects are not appreciated, discomfort will be perceived (D). Vink and Hallbeck (2012) then proposed an enhanced model (Fig. 3) which was based on the models of De Looze et al. (2003) and Moes (2005), as well as on ten papers of a special issue in Applied Ergonomics on product comfort in 2012. In detail, the environmental interaction (I) of the person, the product characteristics and the usage/task can result in internal human body effects (H). Together with the expectations of the person (E) can these effects lead to the perception (P) of these internal effects that can be interpreted as comfort (C), as no feeling (N) or as discomfort (D) that finally could result in musculoskeletal complaints (M). It is also possible that a person feels comfort and discomfort simultaneously, since comfort and discomfort are not clearly interconnected together (model of De Looze et al. (2003)). The circle around E/C highlights that expectations (E) are often linked to comfort (C). A feedback loop between comfort/discomfort and the environment indicates that a too high level of discomfort or a too low level of comfort can be regulated by varying the initial environmental conditions. The main difference between the model of De Looze et al. (2003) and the models of Moes (2005) as well as Vink and Hallbeck (2012) is that in the two latter models the link between the interaction of a person and an office chair to comfort is as strong as the link to discomfort. However, De Looze et al. (2003) indicated a stronger connection between the person-office chair interaction and discomfort.In addition to the above definitions and models on comfort and discomfort, it must be noted that maximum bodily comfort is not the same as an optimal state of sitting comfort. This is because maximal comfort can be found in sleep, and chair users may seek stimulation from the environment (Branton, 1969). It is also important to note that feelings of comfort/discomfort change with sitting duration. Therefore, Mergl (2006) divided sitting comfort/discomfort into initial sitting comfort/discomfort, short-term comfort/discomfort (up to 30 min), and long-term comfort/discomfort (after 30 min).Various objective methods can be used to quantify the subjective comfort/discomfort of an office chair. The easiest and most elementary way to determine discomfort is to measure the length of time subjects can spend in a given sitting position (Hertzberg, 1958) or the time it takes until the subject begins to feel uncomfortable (Jones, 1969). Further methods include pressure measurements of the seat pan and the backrest, measurements of posture, the number of body movements, electromyography (EMG), and foot volume change (De Looze et al., 2003). Objective methods have the advantage of being less time consuming, less dependent on a large number of subjects, less prone to measurement error or bias and are easily applicable in the early stages of the design process (De Looze et al., 2003; Lee et al., 1993). However, technical methods to objectively determine sitting comfort/discomfort are always indirect and, at best, can provide only an indication of a chair user's feeling of comfort/discomfort (De Looze et al., 2003). Due to the elusiveness of comfort/discomfort and individual difficulties in producing valid assessments of comfort/discomfort (Helander et al., 1987), an objective measurement to determine sitting comfort/discomfort is clearly required.In order to demonstrate validity, subjective and objective results should demonstrate a clear correlation. Mainly based on investigations in car seats, several studies (De Looze et al., 2003; Mergl, 2006; Verver, 2004) indicate that the distribution of pressure on the pan of the seat seems to be most clearly associated with subjective comfort/discomfort ratings. However, it remains unclear whether these findings are also valid for office chairs. Since car seats are required to fulfil special safety standards and specific boundary conditions, where the driver's movements are restricted due to seat belts, hand placement on the steering wheel, feet on the pedals, and eyes focussed on the road (Lueder, 1983), it is clear that the requirements and restrictions of office chairs are different. Therefore, with the aim to establish the state of knowledge with respect to comfort during sitting, the purpose of this literature review is to analyse the relation between objective pressure measurement parameters and the quantification of subjective feelings of comfort/discomfort experienced while sitting in an office chair.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In conclusion, the question of whether pressure measurements of the seat pan and the backrest are suitable for assessing the comfort or discomfort experienced while sitting in office chairs cannot be definitively answered due to the limited availability of data. However, the technique used for evaluating the subjective comfort/discomfort seems to play an important role in the interaction analysis between the pressure distribution and subjective ratings of comfort/discomfort. Furthermore, the peak pressure of the seat pan, the pressure distribution of the backrest and the pressure pattern changes (seat pan and backrest) appear to be reliable for quantifying comfort or discomfort.Future work is clearly needed in the field of pressure distribution measures and subjective comfort/discomfort in order to gain a better understanding of the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders in the office environment.
