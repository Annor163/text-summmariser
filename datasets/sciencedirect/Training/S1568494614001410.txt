@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The knowledge of haplotypes allows researchers to identify the genetic variation affecting phenotypic such as health, disease and response to drugs. However, getting haplotype data by experimental methods is both time-consuming and expensive. Haplotype inference (HI) from the genotypes is a challenging problem in the genetics domain. There are several models for inferring haplotypes from genotypes, and one of the models is known as haplotype inference by pure parsimony (HIPP) which aims to minimize the number of distinct haplotypes used. The HIPP was proved to be an NP-hard problem. In this paper, a novel binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is proposed to solve the HIPP problem. The algorithm was tested on variety of simulated and real data sets, and compared with some current methods. The results showed that the method proposed in this paper can obtain the optimal solutions in most of the cases, i.e., it is a potentially powerful method for HIPP.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the post-genome era, as the high-throughput genomic technologies are available, correlating variation in DNA sequence with differences phenotypic (diseases, skin color and so on) has attracted increasing attention [1–3]. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common form of DNA variation [4–6]. Studies showed that haplotypes (the combination of SNPs alleles on the same chromosome) can provide more information than genotypes (the conflated data of two haplotypes) in association studies [7–11]. However, technological limitations make it currently impractical to directly collect haplotypes in experimental way [12,13].There are two ways to solve the Haplotype Inference (HI) problem (find a set of haplotype pairs to explain (or solve) the given genotypes): (1) haplotyping genetically related individuals; (2) haplotyping a population without pedigree information. By the first way, one can get a better estimate of haplotypes, however, it involves significant additional costs [14]. The second one employs computational methods to infer the haplotype from the given genotype data [15–21].On the basis of the fact that the number of observed distinct haplotypes is vastly smaller than the total number of possible haplotypes [17,22,23], the pure parsimony criteria were proposed [22]. The haplotype inference by pure parsimony (HIPP) is to search the smallest number of distinct haplotypes that can solve the given genotypes [22]. HIPP was proved to be an NP-hard problem [22,24]. Several methods were proposed to solve it [17,25]. The first method was based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) [26,27]. Recently, Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO), and Answer Set Programming (ASP) were proposed [28–30]. However, most of these methods need to input all of the possible resolutions of each genotype.As far as we know, the heuristic search algorithm is one of the effective ways to solve the NP-hard problem [31]. Recently, binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) has been steadily gained attention from the research community because it has many advantages, such as simpler implementation and fewer parameters need to adjust, over other evolutionary algorithms [32]. However, the standard BPSO algorithm usually sinks into the local optimal search space at the later stage of the particles’ evolution [33]. In this paper, we propose a heuristic method based on a novel BPSO for the HIPP problem (called NBPSOHAP), and the compatible and incompatible relations between genotypes and haplotypes are used to guide the search direction of NBPSOHAP. We evaluated our algorithm on several simulated and three real data sets, and compared the results with that of some existing methods. The experimental results showed that our method can obtain the optimal solutions in most of the cases and outperforms the comparison algorithms.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the problem of HIPP briefly. Section 3 describes the algorithm proposed in this paper. The dataset and experimental results are provided in Section 4. Finally, we give our conclusions in Section 5.One nucleotide of A, C, G or T in the DNA sequence is replaced by any others, e.g., from CCCTAC to CCTTAC, then we call this variation (C→T) as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [34]. Diploid organisms have two haplotypes, whose positions can be represented by the symbols 0 or 1, where 0 stands for the original base and 1 for the mutant. A position in the genotype has the value of 0 or 1 (called homozygous) if the both haplotypes have the same value 0 or 1; otherwise, it is 2 (called heterozygous).Definition 1HIGiven h genotypes finding a set of haplotypes, such that each genotype is resolved by a pair of haplotypes. A genotype Giis resolved by a pair of haplotypes Hj, Hk, i.e.:IfGil=2thenHjl=Hkl=0IfGil=1thenHjl=Hkl=1IfGil=2thenHjl=1,Hkl=0orHjl=0,Hkl=1For a genotype with n heterozygous positions, there are 2n−1 possible pairs of haplotypes to resolve it. However, studies showed that the number of observed haplotypes is very small, though genotypes exhibit a great diversity [17,35].Definition 2HIPPGiven a set of genotypes, the HIPP aims to find the minimum number of haplotypes to resolve the given genotypes.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Haplotype inference has attracted much attention in recent years. A novel binary particle swarm optimization was proposed to solve the Haplotype inference problem under the pure parsimony criterion. The algorithm was tested on a variety of datasets (three real datasets and twenty-seven simulated data). The experimental results showed that the performances of NBPSOHAP were significantly better than several current known algorithms. In other words, our algorithm is an effective tool for the HIPP problem.
