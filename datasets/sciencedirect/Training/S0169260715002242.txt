@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Three dimensional reconstruction of lung and vessel tree has great significance to 3D observation and quantitative analysis for lung diseases. This paper presents non-sheltered 3D models of lung and vessel tree based on a supervised semi-3D lung tissues segmentation method. A recursive strategy based on geometric active contour is proposed instead of the “coarse-to-fine” framework in existing literature to extract lung tissues from the volumetric CT slices. In this model, the segmentation of the current slice is supervised by the result of the previous one slice due to the slight changes between adjacent slice of lung tissues. Through this mechanism, lung tissues in all the slices are segmented fast and accurately. The serious problems of left and right lungs fusion, caused by partial volume effects, and segmentation of pleural nodules can be settled meanwhile during the semi-3D process. The proposed scheme is evaluated by fifteen scans, from eight healthy participants and seven participants suffering from early-stage lung tumors. The results validate the good performance of the proposed method compared with the “coarse-to-fine” framework. The segmented datasets are utilized to reconstruct the non-sheltered 3D models of lung and vessel tree.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Lung settles the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide and is one of the most important organs for human beings. However, it is vulnerable to many deadly diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis and pneumonia. Among them, lung cancer which represents the first death cause in men and the second in women, has an impressive rate of about five million deadly cases per year [1]. Air pollution, smoking and occupational hazard make a great contribution to those events.Generally, X-ray computed tomography (CT) image is regarded as the gold standard in the non-invasive diagnosis [2] and treatment for pulmonary diseases [3]. However, basing on two dimensional (2D) slices, radiologists and surgeons must view hundreds of CT slices in front of a screen or films, which is boring and time consuming. What's more, they have to imagine the three dimensional (3D) features and the spatial relationships between different structures according to their experience. It is not accurate and varies among different radiologists. 3D reconstruction is a powerful medical data visualization technology for physicians and medical researchers. 3D reconstruction could manage all the slices of one patient in a single vision. It has the potential to simplify the radiologic study and could be widely used in clinical surgical treatment planning [4,5], radiation therapy [6], plasty [7,8], etc.3D reconstruction of lung, vessel tree and tumors is an essential reference for lung cancer and other diseases decisions in clinical diagnosis. Because of the lower density compared with the surrounding high-density bones, muscles and vessels, lung will be sheltered by peripheral tissues in the 3D model of whole body. For example, to view the right side of the lung vessels, chest wall in the right side should be cut away. The sheltered lung models will affect the observation, localization and 3D measurement of lung lesions [9]. In order to realize non-sheltered lung and vessel tree, pre-segmentation of lung tissues from volumetric images is necessary. However, the intensities of parenchyma, vessels, bronchus and tumors differ greatly [2,10]. It brings difficulties to realize a global segmentation of all the pulmonary structures [11]. Lung segmentation from the CT volumetric dataset is still one of the challenges in medical image analysis [12]. With the segmented subdatasets, non-sheltered 3D lung models could be realized using 3D reconstruction method. The spatial relationship between different structures will be obvious and radiologists can get the anatomical knowledge of 3D structures [13]. What's more, the segmented dataset could be used in quantitative analysis, for example vital capacity measurement [14], non-invasive pulmonary function tests[15] etc.
