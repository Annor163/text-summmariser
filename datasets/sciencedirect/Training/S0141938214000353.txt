@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We investigate the effect of the metal pattern shape (i.e., square, hexagonal, and random grids) on the starburst phenomenon of touch screen panels (TSPs) based on opaque metallic grids. It is demonstrated that a standalone random metal grid can suppress the starburst phenomenon to a great extent. By way of ray tracing simulation, we have found that specular reflection of light on the gentle slope of the patterned edges of metallic grids contributes to the generation of starburst patterns. It is also addressed that employing a light-absorbing material and increasing metal grid spacing can reduce the intensity of starburst patterns.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
For touch screen panels (TSPs), high-transparency indium-tin-oxide (ITO) has been widely used as a sensing electrode [1,2]. In recent years, however, metal films such as silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) exhibiting lower price, higher electrical conductivity, and superior durability attract much attention for medium and large TSPs [3]. To ensure high optical transmittance, those metals must be patterned with the width of less than 10μm. Using a printing process, however, it is difficult to fabricate metal mesh having the grid width of less than 5μm. In the case where the width of metal mesh is large, there arises an interference between the metal mesh of a TSP and the black matrix (BM) in displays, the phenomenon known as the moiré effect [4,5,6,7]. In addition, the starburst phenomenon is inevitably generated owing to specular reflection, diffraction, and interference of light by the metal mesh. The metal mesh used for TSPs is a kind of reflective diffraction grid. Such a grid induces specular reflection and diffraction of incident light. Due to diffraction of light, the diffraction pattern appears when a wave encounters a slit (i.e., metal mesh). There appears constructive and destructive interference of light on the diffraction pattern. Because of specular reflection of light, the reflection pattern also appears when there exists a gentle slope near the patterned metallic grid. Such diffraction and reflection effects result in the appearance of “starburst” patterns when a touch position-sensing panel is subject to bright ambient light. Both of them are troublesome issues in the field of visible displays because it may disturb users upon emergence. The moiré effect is known to be suppressed substantially by adjusting the crossing angle between a TSP and display screen [7], reducing the metal grid width down to 1μm, and employing a random metal grid. To our best knowledge, however, no report on the effective way of suppressing the starburst phenomenon is available in the open literature. In this paper, we investigate the effect of metal grids on the starburst phenomenon and provide useful guidelines for the design of starburst-free metal meshes for TSP applications. By way of experiment, it is demonstrated that a standalone random metal grid can suppress the starburst phenomenon to a great extent. By way of ray tracing simulation [8], we have found that specular reflection of light on the gentle slope of the patterned edges of metallic grids contributes to the generation of starburst patterns. The intensity of starburst patterns is also shown to be suppressed by employing a light-absorbing material and increasing metal grid spacing.
