@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper proposes a globally rotation invariant multi-scale co-occurrence local binary pattern (MCLBP) feature for texture-relevant tasks. In MCLBP, we arrange all co-occurrence patterns into groups according to properties of the co-patterns, and design three encoding functions (Sum, Moment, and Fourier Pooling) to extract features from each group. The MCLBP can effectively capture the correlation information between different scales and is also globally rotation invariant (GRI). The MCLBP is substantially different from most existing LBP variants including the LBP, the CLBP, and the MSJ-LBP that achieves rotation invariance by locally rotation invariant (LRI) encoding. We fully evaluate the properties of the MCLBP and compare it with some powerful features on five challenging databases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MCLBP compared to the state-of-the-art LBP variants including the CLBP and the LBPHF. Meanwhile, the dimension and computational cost of the MCLBP is also lower than that of the CLBP_S/M/C and LBPHF_S_M.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Texture cue plays an important role in many vision applications, including scene understanding, object recognition, content-based image retrieval, medical image analysis, image segmentation, and more. Due to the existence of strong rotation, illumination, and scale variations, effective description of texture information is challenging.Local Binary Pattern (LBP) [1] shows great success on many texture-related tasks due to its strong texture discrimination and robustness to image transformations including rotation and gray-scale variations. Meanwhile, besides of texture [2–7] and material classification [8,9], the LBP and its variants have been widely applied to many applications, including face recognition [10], face detection, flower recognition [9], image retrieval, lip reading [11], and dynamic texture classification [12]. A detailed survey about the LBP and its variants can be found in [13].To capture texture information in different image resolutions, a multi-scale strategy [2,14,8,4,5] has been introduced. Firstly, LBP histogram features are extracted separately from each scale. Then, the histograms in all scales are concatenated into a final image representation. The same multi-scale strategy are used by the LBP and most of its variants. Since the multi-scale strategy usually achieves better performance than a single scale, it is widely recognized as an indispensable means to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.However, the classical multi-scale strategy ignores correlation among different scales. As shown at the left panel of Fig. 1, a single-scale LBP pattern depicts a kind of local image structure, but the LBP patterns in multiple scales jointly depict a stronger local structure, as shown at the right panel of Fig. 1. In fact, texture patterns in different scales around the same central point usually have strong correlation. Ignoring such correlation will lead to a huge loss of discriminative information.To capture the correlation between different scales, we propose to jointly encode the LBPs in different scales. We summarize our key contributions as follows:•We propose a globally rotation invariant multi-scale co-occurrence LBP (MCLBP) feature for texture-relevant tasks. In contrast to the classical multi-scale LBP (MS-LBP), our MCLBP can effectively encode the correlation that is ignored by MS-LBP. Compared to the single-scale LBP, the MCLBP can depict stronger local structures and capture richer patterns.We investigate the rotation invariant property of the MCLBP and introduce three simple and effective rotation invariant encoding methods. Specifically, we partition all MCLBP patterns into different groups according to the properties of the co-patterns. For each group, we can extract a rotation invariant feature using the introduced encoding methods.We fully evaluate the properties of the MCLBP on five challenging databases. The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art LBP variants, such as CLBP_S/M/C [4], LBPHF_S_M [6]. It also greatly improves the performance of our previous conference version (MSJ-LBP). It should be noted that, compared to some powerful LBP variants, the computational cost and feature dimension of the proposed feature is also much lower.
