@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a new locking-free element triangular thick plate element with 9 standard kinematic degrees of freedom and 6 additional degrees of freedom for shear strains (TTK9S6) for analyzing plate/shell structures of thin or thick members is developed. With an appropriate use of independent shear degrees of freedom (DOF), the shear locking problem is completely removed without inducing any numerical expediency such as reduced integration, assumptions of strains/stresses, nor are additional efforts needed to stabilize spurious zero energy modes. Compared to existing triangular shear-deformable plate elements that pass patch tests for both thick and thin plates, the formulation of the present TTK9S6 element is very simple—and perhaps as simple as possible. A number of numerical examples are tested showing the convergence and accuracy of the TTK9S6 element.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Plate/shell structures are widely used in civil, naval and aerospace engineering. For the stress analysis of plate/shell members in the design of structures, two main theories, namely Kirchhoff plate theory and Mindlin–Reissner plate theory, have been developed. It is well known that a plate model based on Kirchhoff plate theory, denoted as Kirchhoff plate, is appropriate for the modeling of thin structures where shear deformation can be ignored. Unfortunately, the finite element discretization of Kirchhoff plate theory requires C1 continuity of the interpolation, which is a significant drawback. Conversely, Mindlin–Reissner plate theory for the analyses of thin and thick structures requires only C0 continuity for the transverse displacement and the normal rotations, and thus the difficulties of constructing C1 interpolations are avoided. However, Mindlin–Reissner plate elements with displacement DOF only produce poor results in the thin plate limit because of the shear locking phenomenon. In order to eliminate shear locking from Mindlin–Reissner plate elements, reduced integration, assumed natural stain approach, and assumed stress elements (also known as mixed/hybrid stress elements) have been proposed. For example, we mention the reduced integration method by Zienkiewicz et al. [1] and Pugh et al. [2], the selective integration method by Malkus and Hughes [3] and Hughes et al. [4] the mixed interpolation of tensorial components (MITC) element family by Bathe and Dvorkin [5], the Discrete Shear Triangular (DST) element family by Batoz and Lardeur [6] and Batoz and Katili [7] which was later extended by Zienkiewicz et al. [8], and the mixed interpolation and smoothed curvatures (MISC) element by Nguyen et al. [9], the refined 9-Dof triangular Mindlin plate elements (RDKTM) by Chen and Cheung [10], the hybrid-Trefftz plate elements by Choo et al. [11], the assumed stress/strain elements by Lee and Pian [12], Katili [13], Brasile [14] and the “discrete shear gap” (DSG) technique [15,16] as a more general triangular plate element employing displacement and shear DOFs at each node by assuming the ‘natural strain’ mode. However, most of these elements introduced new problems of spurious energy-free modes. Furthermore, the formulation or the numerical implementation of such elements is usually complex.In recent years, meshless approaches have drawn much attention in plate analysis due to their higher order continuity of approximation in a global sense, and they have been used to develop higher order continuous plate element, to eliminate the excessive degrees of freedom and to successfully circumvent shear locking in thick structures. Donning et al. [17] used the cardinal spline function to construct C2 meshless approximation which is valid for modeling thin and moderately thick plates. Le et al. [18] used the MLS approximation for the construction of smooth pure moment fields to calculate the lower bound limit load of plates using only nodal displacements as unknowns. Kanok-Nukulchai et al. presented a method for completely eliminating the presence of transverse shear locking in shear-deformable plates by applying the Element-free Galerkin (EFG) Method [19]. In Ref. [20], a locking-free Meshless Local-Petrov Galerkin (MLPG) formulation is presented for shear-deformable thick plates. Moreover, the applicability of a meshless approach in problems of crack propagation and large deformation analyses appears to be far more flexible than that of the standard FEM such as the thin shell formulation for modeling dynamic fracture [21]. However, the field reproduced by a meshless approximation is usually non-polynomial in a global sense and theories developed so far in the context of FE for error control in many cases do not directly apply to meshless approximations [22] unless a series of analyses is carried out a posteriori—however, this has significant adverse implications on computing time. Moreover, the computational cost in obtaining shape functions and performing numerical integration with acceptable accuracy is overall much more expensive than in the FEM. There are growing interests at present in developing the so-called smoothed FEM for shell analysis where the integral of shear strain only appears on element edges. Other novel method including SFEM [23,24], phantom node method [25] and NURBs based FEM [26] are also exploited by utilizing their advantages such as smoothing approximation, better geometric representation of curved structures or flexibility in modeling arbitrary crack propagation in shells.Although the use of these novel numerical method can be promising, in this paper we wish to focus on finite element techniques, since the finite element method remains the most widely used method of spatial discretization in solid and structural mechanics. Thus, we present a new locking-free element, named TTK9S6, which is effective for analyses of plate/shell structures comprising of thin or thick members. The present element is a three-noded plate element with 5 DOF per node, consisting of 1 transverse displacement, 2 derivatives of the transverse displacement around two independent axes, and 2 transverse shear strain DOF. The shear locking problem is completely removed in the TTK9S6 element, without any numerical expediency such as reduced integration, the use of assumed strains/stresses, or the need for the stabilization of spurious zero energy modes, by an appropriate use of the independent shear DOF, as discussed in Refs. [27,28]. Notably, in Ref. [28] the formulation is based on the DST element while the independent shear degrees of freedom are used. Here, we do not follow the DST formulation and instead a completely new triangular plate element is developed using 9 kinematic degrees of freedoms and 6 shear degrees of freedom. It will be shown that the present TTK9S6 has, arguably, the simplest formulation compared to all the other existing triangular shear-deformable plate elements that can pass patch tests for thick as well as thin plates. The present element is capable of removing the shear locking problem, it is however necessary to mention that the convergence rate of finite elements does not necessarily depend on the locking-free condition. Though the present formulation of triangular element introduces additional DOFs per node, it has a general formulation from thin to thick plates. There is no equivalent formulation in the literature to the authors knowledge compared to the present formulation.In this section the interpolation of the new TTK9S6 element will be described. We will start with the decomposition of the transverse shear strain from the total rotation.Consider a typical three-noded triangular plate element of which the side view is shown inFig. 1. The derivatives of the transverse displacement w with respect to two independent axes, without separating the influence of transverse shear deformation, are expressed as(1)θx=∂w∂x,θy=∂w∂yhereθxwill include the contribution from the rigid body rotation of the plate around the y axis denoted asθ^x. Similarly,θycontains a partθ^yrepresenting the rigid body rotation of the plate around the x axis. In this way, the influence of the transverse shear deformation can be separated from rotation as shown inFig. 2. Thus the transverse shear strains of the element can be expressed by(2)γx=θx−θ^x,γy=θy−θ^yIn the following, the shape functions used for the transverse displacement, rotation and shear strain in the TTK9S6 element will be described. In the derivation, additional mid-side nodes are employed as shown inFig. 3. These mid-side nodes are only used for calculating shape functions and do not lead to additional global unknowns as it was the case in the study on DST elements [7,8]. Now we define the following shape functions:(3)ϕi=Li,ϕxi=12(x−xi)Li,ϕyi=12(y−yi)Li(4)Ri=(∑k=46Nk)ϕi,x,Rxi=Ni+∑k=46(Nkϕxi,xk),Ryi=∑k=46(Nkϕyi,xk)(5)Qi=(∑k=46Nk)ϕi,y,Qxi=∑k=46(Nkϕxi,yk),Qyi=Ni+∑k=46(Nkϕyi,yk)where the subscript,xdenotes the derivatives with respect tox,x=i(xi,yi)are the coordinates of nodei(i=1,2,3), superscriptk(k=4,5,6)refers to the indices of the mid-side nodes andLiare the area coordinates of the three-node triangular plate elements which can be expressed as(6)Li=12A(ai+bix+ciy)(7)ai=xjym−xmyj,bi=yj−ym,ci=−xj+xmwhereAis the area of the triangular element in the x–y plane and the variation of subscript indices followsi=1,2,3;j=2,3,1;m=3,1,2. HereNj(j=1~6)are the shape functions which can be calculated in the same way for the six-noded FE triangular element by(8)Nj=(2Lj−1)Lj(j=1,2,3)N4=4L1L2,N5=4L2L3,N6=4L3L1Note that shape function Eqs. (3)–(5) are derived by choosing complete quadratic basis and deliberately formulated so that the Kirchhoff assumption is satisfied at nodes. Details in the construction of theses formulations can be found the Appendix for Eq. (A-(1)–A-6). The derivatives of the shape functions in Eqs. (4) and (5) can be calculated by(9)ϕxi,xk=12[Li(xk,yk)+(xk−xi)Li,x],ϕyi,xk=12(yk−yi)Li,xϕxi,yk=12(xk−xi)Li,y,ϕyi,yk=12[Li(xk,yk)+(yk−yi)Li,y]Using the above described shape functions and their derivatives, the displacement in each plate element can be approximated by(10)w=∑i=13(ϕiwi+ϕxiθxi+ϕyiθyi)θx=∑i=13(Riwi+Rxiθxi+Ryiθyi)θy=∑i=13(Qiwi+Qxiθxi+Qyiθyi)γx=∑i=13(Liγxi)γy=∑i=13(Liγyi)wherewi,θxi,θyi,γxiandγyiare the 5 DOFs at each nodei.It can be seen from Eq. (10) that, by construction, the proposed interpolations satisfies the Kirchhoff hypothesis at the nodes plotted in Fig. 3, that is(11)θxi=∂w∂x|x=xi,θyi=∂w∂y|x=xiatnodesi(i=1,2,3)(12)θxk=∂w∂x|x=xk,θyk=∂w∂y|x=xkatnodesk(k=4,5,6)For details of the proof, please refer to the Appendix of the paper.Substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (2), the interpolation functions of the TTK9S6 can be expressed as(13)U=Na=[N1N2N3]{a1a2a3}where(14)U=[wθ^xθ^yγxγy]T(15)ai=[wiθxiθyiγxiγyi]T[i=1,2,3](16)Ni=[ϕiϕxiϕyi00RiRxiRyi−Li0QiQxiQyi0−Li000Li00000Li][i=1,2,3]It should be noted thatγxiandγyiin Eq. (13) are retained as independent DOFs and in this way the results obtained are locking-free for thick as well as thin plates/shells, without using such numerical expediencies as selective/reduced integrations and without the need for stabilizing spurious modes of zero-energy.In this section, the discretization of the present TTK9S6 element will be derived in matrix form for the convenience of implementation. The strain energy in an element can be calculated as [10](17)Πp=12∫Ae(χTDbχ+γTDsγ)dxdywhereχdenotes the vector of bending strains (or curvatures) andγdenotes the vector of shear strains(18)χ=[∂θ^x∂x∂θ^y∂y∂θ^x∂y+∂θ^y∂x]T,γ=[γxγy]TFurthermore,(19)Db=Eh312(1−ν2)[1ν0ν10001−ν2],Ds=5Eh12(1+ν)[1001]whereEis Young's modulus,νis Poisson's ratio, andhis the thickness of the plate element.Substituting Eq. (13) into Eq. (17), the element stiffness matrix of the TTK9S6 can be written as(20)Ke=Kbe+Ksewhere the bending part and the shear strain part of the element stiffness matrix can be respectively written as(21)Kbe=∫AeBbTDbBbdxdy,Kse=∫AeBsTDsBsdxdywith(22)Bb=[Bb1Bb2Bb3](23)Bbi=[Ri,xRxi,xRyi,x−Li,x0Qi,yQxi,yQyi,y0−Li,yRi,y+Qi,xRxi,y+Qxi,xRyi,y+Qyi,x−Li,y−Li,x]and(24)Bs=[Bs1Bs2Bs3](25)Bsi=[000Li00000Li]It is clear from the above derivations that the formulation of the presented TTK9S6 element is both concise and simple to implement compared to many existing shear-deformable triangular plate elements. There is no assumption on strains/stresses, nor are additional efforts needed to stabilize spurious zero energy modes as is the case with many other existing methods.In the numerical studies in the following section, it will be shown that the present element passes the patch test for thin and thick plates. Therefore, it is believed that the present TTK9S6 can be very useful for practical applications in the analyses of plate/shell structures comprising of thin or thick members.In this section, a number of numerical studies are carried out testing the performance and validity of the TTK9S6 element. For comparison purposes, the well established T3 and DST-BL elements have been tested for the same examples against the results given by the proposed TTK9S6, where T3 denotes the triangular displacement element using full integration scheme and DST-BL stands for Discrete Mindlin triangular plate element proposed by Batoz and Lardeur [6].The present TTK9S6 element is firstly tested using a square patch with an unstructured triangulation as shown inFig. 4. The assumed material properties of the plate areE=1×107for Young's modulus andν=0.3for Poisson's ratio. The thickness and characteristic length of the plate arehandl, respectively. In the above, material parameters and size of the plate are set to be dimensionless and the results are measured in a relative manner in the following. The boundary conditions imposed for the patch are as follows:(26)w=x2+xy+y2,θx=2x+y,θy=x+2yγx=0,γy=0(atboundarynodes1,2,3,4)namely, quadratic for transverse displacement, linear for rotations and constant values for shear strains. Note that Eq. (26) are boundary conditions that are only applied for boundary nodes 1–4, and the purpose of the patch test is to test whether the prescribed quadratic displacement, linear rotations and constant shear strain will be produced for the nodes falling inside the patch. And if so, the present element passes the patch test. A number of tests have been performed by varying the ratio between h and l. The displacement results of node 5 and the elemental bending and torsion moments, which were found constant for any set values of the ratio of h over l, are listed inTable 1. We have tested h/l varying from 1.0e−3 to 100. Of course the extremity ratio of 100 does not any longer correspond to a plate structure but is used to compare the capabilities between the elements. The relative errors of transverse displacement of node 5 with respect to exact solutions using Eq. (26) and results given by DST-BL are plotted inFig. 5 in a log scale, showing the present TTK9S6 passes the patch test for thick to very thin plates. This is however not the case for DST-BL and the relative error increases with the increase size of thickness and up to 1% when h/l is greater than 1. It can also be seen from Fig. 1 that elements comprising nodes 5,7,8 and 4,5,8 are of relatively slender geometry and can be regarded as moderately distorted. The present element passes this test showing satisfactory accuracy. For more distorted mesh, it will be an interesting topic on mesh sensitivity such as by applying the element for large deformation problem.In the second example, a clamped (or simply supported) square plate subjected to a uniformly distributed transverse load q is considered for linear elastic analysis. The side length and thickness of the plate are l and h, respectively. Due to the symmetry of geometry and boundary conditions, only a quarter of the plate needs to be modeled as shown inFig. 6.Noting that the shear strainsγxandγy(see Fig. 2) are actually the rotations induced by the transverse shear deformation, the boundary conditions of the clamped square plate are imposed as follows:(27)x=0:θxi=0,γxi=0y=0:θyi=0,γyi=0x=a:θxi=θyi=0,γxi=γyi=0,wi=0y=a:θxi=θyi=0,γxi=γyi=0,wi=0It should be noted that on the symmetric boundary forx=aandy=a, we also constrainγxiandγyiapart from the constraint ofθxiθyidue to the used of additional degrees of freedom as shown in Fig. 2 and Eq. (2).Tables 2–4 list the results given by the T3, DST-BL, DST-S6 and the present TTK9S6. Overall good results are obtained for the new locking-free element TTK9S6 compared to DST-BL, DST-S6 and T3. The errors of central deflection with respect to the plate thickness subjected to clamp and simple support boundary conditions are plotted inFigs. 7 and 8 respectively. For a clear comparison between different methods within similar error scales, the error of TTK9S6(4×4) which is too large is not plotted in Fig. 7. It can be seen from the figures that the present method tends to be softer with the increase of the plate thickness.A clamped circular plate subjected to a uniformly distributed loadqis considered. The radius of the plate isr=100and the thickness of the plate ish. The material properties areE=100for Young's modulus andν=0.3for Poisson's ratio. Due to the symmetry of the geometry and boundary conditions, only one quarter of the plate is discretized as shown in Fig. 7. Four nodal distributions of 25, 81, 289 and 1089 nodes are employed for the convergence studies (Fig. 9). Similarly good results are obtained by the present element TTK9S6, as listed inTable 5. InFig. 10, the convergence of the relative error in central deflection with respect to h/l is compared between different methods. For a clear comparison between different methods within similar error scales, the error of TTK9S6 (25 nodes) which is too large is not plotted in the figure. It can be seen from the figure that the errors using the present element is quite stable regarding the plate thickness and decreases when a finer mesh is used. InTable 6, we compare the CPU time using various methods by testing the example using 1089 nodes. It can be seen the computational cost of the present formulation is between DST-BL and DST-S6 while the T3 element has the minimum computational times however with the lowest accuracy.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We proposed a new locking-free element, which is termed as TTK9S9, using nine kinematics degrees and six shear degrees per element. The transverse shear strains in two independent directions are introduced as the additional shear DOFs, in order to avoid shear locking in the analysis of plate/shell structures comprising of thin or thick members. It is shown that the proposed element passes the patch test and does not exhibit shear locking in the limit to thin plates. The most promising feature of the TTK9S9 is its simple formulation and numerical implementation. Numerical examples demonstrate the excellent performances of the element.
