@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the present work, we discuss and assess the performances of Earth cylindrical shadow model (ECSM) and Earth shadow conical model (ESCM), with application to the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS), Low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites; Cartosat-2A, Meghatropics-1, Resourcesat-2 and Oceansat-2. Both models are very simple and efficient for the prediction of eclipse states of any Earth orbiting eclipsing satellite at a given epoch. The advantage of using ESCM over ECSM is that first one predicts both states of eclipse penumbra and umbra while the later one predicts only one which, in reality, is not true. The ESCM model can be effectively useful for the precise orbit prediction and satellite operation to utilize the power properly.Earth’s equatorial radiusSun vectorSun unit vectorSpacecraft (S/C) position vectorDot product betweenS/Cposition vector and Sun unit vectorProjection vector ofS/Cposition vector onto Sun unit vectorVector originating at the shadow axis, pointing toS/Cat the projectedS/ClocationMagnitude of the vectorq⃗Coordinates of a point on the surface of the spherical Earth in ECI frameComponents ofS/Cposition vectorrs/c⃗from the geo-centerVector joining Sun-edge 1 toS/CVector joining Sun-edge 2 toS/CComponents of the vectorb⃗Components of the vectorc⃗Vector representing the line from geo-center to Sun-edge 1Vector representing the line from geo-center to Sun-edge 2Unit vector which lies in the plane and perpendicular to Sun vectorVector normal to the planeRadius of the photosphereDistance between Sun andS/CDistance between Sun and point of intersection of Line 1Distance between Sun and point of intersection of Line 2Difference operator

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Most of the Earth-orbiting spacecrafts experience partial or full eclipse when the spacecraft passes through the dark side of the Earth. Apart from the occultation of the Sun by the Earth, the Moon may also cast shadow on the satellite; however these events occur less frequently and in a random fashion. Computation of eclipse conditions is generally applied for the Earth as the occulting body. These partial or total eclipse conditions correspond to the regions known as penumbra and umbra as shown in Fig. 1. The umbra region receives no direct light from the Sun and is in total darkness, and so there is no solar radiation pressure (SRP) while the penumbra region receives partial light and is quite small, so that in penumbra SRP cannot be neglected.When a spacecraft is eclipsed space scientists and researchers become very keen in many activities such as the times of shadow entrance and exit, the Sun–satellite geometry etc. Such information is very useful for various utilizations e.g. thermal control requirements, sizing solar panel arrays and batteries, accessing duty cycle, and power management characteristics of satellite subsystems. To model accurately the forces acting on the satellite due to solar radiation, it is important to know exactly when the satellite enters or exits a shadow region since the amount of solar radiation incident on the spacecraft drops dramatically.From the literature survey, it can be found that the shadow state prediction model falls into two categories namely; spherical Earth conical shadow model and cylindrical shadow model, respectively. Escobal (1976) developed conical and cylindrical shadow models by finding two non-spurious roots of a quartic polynomial in the cosine of the true anomaly which was solved in closed form by quadratic radicals, while Vallado (2007) developed both shadow models numerically using Newton–Raphson technique involving the solution of quartic polynomial of the true anomaly. Wertz (2002) and Montenbruck and Gill (2005) used a spherical earth conical shadow model based on the angular separation and diameters of the Sun and the Earth. Hubaux et al. (2012) presented an innovative way of spherical earth modeling umbra and penumbra cone crossings during the numerical integration of space debris orbit. Adhya et al. (2004) proposed a conical shadow model accounting oblateness of the Earth. However, a numerical investigation (Vokrouhlicky et al., 1996) has shown that the oblateness of the Earth did not bring significant differences compared to a spherical Earth for the LEO satellites. The cylindrical shadow model totally ignores the penumbral region where the flux gradually diminishes. From the computation point of view, these methods are simple to implement but they result in errors in precise orbit computation. It has been shown that with respect to a spherical Earth the main changes occur in the timing of umbra and penumbra transitions, and in the overall duration of the eclipse periods. Woodburn (2000) showed that such mistiming has important consequences for the precise numerical integration of orbit trajectories.This paper describes and assesses the performances of both ECSM and ESCM models while applying them to Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites; Cartosat-2A (CAR-2A), Meghatropics-1 (MEGH-1), Resourcesat-2 (RES-2) and Oceansat-2 (OCN-2). The paper is structured as follows; in Section  2, ECSM and ESCM models have been described. The applications of the models to IRS satellites have been presented in Section  3 and a concluding discussion is given in Section  4.Assume that the Sun is infinitely far from the Earth, so the light rays are parallel, producing a cylindrical Earth shadow of radiusre, equatorial radius of theEarth(re=6378.137km), as shown in the Fig. 2. Having the Sun unit vectorrsun̂and the spacecraft position vectorrs/c⃗we find the projection ofrs/c⃗ontorsun̂. Algorithm 2.1 allows to determine whether the spacecraft is in shadow region of the Earth or not.Algorithm 2.1Eclipse Prediction Using ECSM ModelThe spacecraft status whether it is eclipsed or not, is determined by the following steps.Step (I):compute the spacecraft(S/C) position vector,rs/c⃗from the geo-center.compute the Sun unit vector,rsun̂from the geo-center.compute the dot product,dprodbetweenrs/c⃗andrsun̂.compute the projection,ps/c_sun⃗ofrs/c⃗ontorsun̂compute the vector,q⃗originating at the shadow axis, pointing to theS/Cat the projectedS/Clocation.compute the magnitude,|q⃗|of the vectorq⃗.ifdprod>0⇒S/Cis in sunlit state.ifdprod<0and|q⃗|<re⇒S/Cis in eclipse state.elseS/Cis in sunlit state.The cylindrical model computation is often adequate, but it is necessary to have a technique that allows to find the precise penumbra and umbra regions. In the next section, we describe a technique for the precise penumbra and umbra predictions.Fig. 3depicts the Earth’s shadow cone geometry featuring umbra and penumbra regions. Approximating the surface of the Earth as a sphere, given as(1)x2+y2+z2=re2,where(x,y,z)are the coordinates of a point in space on the surface of the sphere in the ECI frame,reis the Earth’s equatorial radius.Assume that, Line 1 denotes the line passing through the spacecraft and Sun-edge 1 and Line 2 as the line passing through the spacecraft and Sun-edge 2. Let us take(a1,a2,a3)as the components of the spacecraft’s position vectorrs/c⃗from the geo-center,(b1,b2,b3)as the components of the vectorb⃗from Sun-edge 1 to the spacecraft and(c1,c2,c3)as the components of the vectorc⃗from Sun-edge 2 to the spacecraft.Any point(x,y,z)on Line 1 satisfies the equation(2)x−a1b1=y−a2b2=z−a3b3.Similarly, any point(x,y,z)on Line 2 satisfies the equation(3)x−a1c1=y−a2c2=z−a3c3.Suppose that the vectorsrs1⃗andrs2⃗define the lines from the geo-center to Sun-edge 1 and Sun edge 2 respectively, then we have(4)b⃗=rs/c⃗−rs1⃗,c⃗=rs/c⃗−rs2⃗,}.The unit vectorSp̂which lies in the plane and perpendicular torsun⃗, can be obtained as(5)Sp̂=Sp⃗|Sp⃗|=rsun⃗×ri⃗|rsun⃗×ri⃗|,whereSp⃗andri⃗(ri⃗is a vector normal to the plane) are given as(6)Sp⃗=rsun⃗×ri⃗,(7)ri⃗=rsun⃗×rs/c⃗.Thus, the two Sun-edge points are expressed as(8)rs1⃗=rsun⃗−RsSp̂,rs2⃗=rsun⃗+RsSp̂,}whereRsis the radius of the photosphere which is approximately 696000 km (Wertz, 2002).From Eq. (2), Line 1 can be obtained as(9)y=b2b1(x−a1)+a2,z=b3b1(x−a1)+a3,}.Similarly from Eq. (3), Line 2 can be given as(10)y=c2c1(x−a1)+a2,z=c3c1(x−a1)+a3,}.From Eqs. (1) and (9), the following relation for the Line 1 is obtained.(11)x2+[b2b1(x−a1)+a2]2+[b3b1(x−a1)+a3]2=re2.Eq. (11) can be expressed as(12)ALine1x2+BLine1x+CLine1=0,where the coefficientsALine1,BLine1andCLine1are obtained as(13)ALine1=b12+b22+b32,BLine1=2b1(b2a2+b3a3)−2a1(b22−b32),CLine1=b12(a22+a32)+(b22+b32)a12−2b1a1(b2a2+b3a3)−b12re2,}.Similarly, for Line 2, we have(14)ALine2x2+BLine2x+CLine2=0,where(15)ALine2=c12+c22+c32,BLine2=2c1(c2a2+c3a3)−2a1(c22−c32),CLine2=c12(a22+a32)+(c22+c32)a12−2c1a1(c2a2+c3a3)−c12re2,}.Thex-coordinates of the points of intersection of the sphere and Sun-edges 1 and 2 to the spacecraft line are given by the real solutions to Eqs. (12) and (14). Once the values ofxare obtained, we obtain values ofyandzvalues for Line 1 and Line 2, and hence the coordinates of the points of intersection where these lines intersect the Earth are obtained. When the conditions(16)BLine12−4ALine1CLine1≥0,Line1BLine22−4ALine2CLine2≥0,Line2}are satisfied, then a real solution to Eqs. (12) and (14) exists. If the Eq. (16) is satisfied, an intersection occurs. A negative value solution to Eq. (16) has no physical meaning, but shows that no intersection takes place. The Algorithm 2.2 is used to determine whether spacecraft is in sunlit, umbra or penumbra states. Fig. 4depicts whetherS/Cis in sunlit, or in umbra or penumbra using the Algorithm 2.2.Algorithm 2.2Umbra and Penumbra Predictions Using ESCMTo determine the spacecraft’s status whether it is in full sunlit, umbra or penumbra, the following approach is carried out.Step (I):compute the Sun vector,rsun⃗at the epoch.compute theSpacecraft(S/C)position vector,rs/c⃗at the epoch.compute the distance,dsun_s/cbetween Sun andS/C.compute vectorsb→andc→from the Sun-edge 1 and Sun-edge 2 toS/C.find the equation of Line 1 and Line 2 joining the Sun-edge 1and Sun-edge 2 toS/C.test whether Line 1 or Line 2 intersects the sphere or not, if an intersection occurs, compute:(a)distance,dsun_intpt_Line1between Sun and the point of intersection of Line 1, joining Sun edge 1 and Spacecraft line.distance,dsun_intpt_Line2between Sun and point of intersection of Line 2, joining Sun edge 2 and Spacecraft line.if an intersection takes place anddsun_intpt_Line1≤dsun_s/canddsun_intpt_Line2≤dsun_s/c⇒orS/Cis either in penumbra or umbra; go for the following tests:(a)if both lines intersect the Earth anddsun_s/c≥dsun_intpt_Line1anddsun_s/c≥dsun_intpt_Line2⇒andS/Cis in umbra region.if only Line 1 intersects the Earth anddsun_s/c≥dsun_intpt_Line1⇒S/Cis in penumbra region,if only Line 2 intersects the Earth anddsun_s/c≥dsun_intpt_Line2⇒S/Cis in penumbra region.elseS/Cis in full sunlit state.Algorithms 2.1 and 2.2 provide the information whether the spacecraft is in sunlit or eclipse states provided the Sun vector,rsun⃗and the spacecraft position vector,rs/c⃗are known at a specific epoch. The algorithms were applied to the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites; Cartosat-2A, Meghatropics-1, Resourcesat-2 and Oceansat-2. State vectors of these satellites were generated at 1 s interval whose initial state vectors are shown in Table 1. A comparative study has been done between the Earth cylindrical shadow model (ECSM) and Earth shadow conical model (ESCM) for these satellites with the help of Tables 2–5, while the on-board eclipse entry and exit timings for these satellites are shown in Table 6. It can be seen that ESCM and ECSM results are very close to the on-board real data. Furthermore, it can be observed that ECSM model predicts only umbra state, while ESCM model predicts both states. It can be noticed that for these IRS satellites penumbra occurs for around 16–22 s in each orbit while umbra occurs for around 35 min. As altitude of the spacecraft increases, duration of penumbra will be more, so in such scenario, ESCM model will be more accurate as it will accurately calculate SRP due to penumbra presence than the ECSM model, assuming a cylindrical shadow behind the Earth (Mullins, 1991) (strictly an incorrect assumption), which neglects penumbra appearance as for low Earth orbiting satellites, an incorrect transition point will introduce a systematic bias over many orbit revolutions.The mean time difference between the entry and exit conditions of ECSM and ESCM models with respect to the real time data has been computed and is shown in Tables 7 and 8for the two satellites CAR-2A and OCN-2 having different altitudes. This error is also expressed in terms of3σvalue, whereσis the standard deviation. Similar error measurement can be done for RES-2 and MEGH-1 satellites.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, ECSM and ESCM models have been illustrated to predict eclipse states for the Earth-orbiting eclipsing spacecrafts, knowing the Sun vector and the spacecraft position vector at a specific epoch time. Both models have been applied to IRS satellites; CAR-2A, MEGH-1, RES-2, OCN-2. It is observed that ESCM model features both umbra and penumbra behaviors while ECSM model features only eclipse (umbra). As altitude of the spacecraft increases, duration of penumbra will be more, so under such situations, ESCM model will be more accurate as it will accurately calculate SRP due to penumbra occurrences than the ECSM model.Supplementary material related to this article can be found online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2013.06.001.The following is the Supplementary material related to this article.MMC S1CAR-2A satellite state vectors on 7th Jan 2013.MMC S2MEGH-1 satellite state vectors on 14th Jan 2013.MMC S3OCN-2 satellite state vectors on 18th Jan 2013.MMC S4RES-2 satellite state vectors on 14th Jan 2013.
