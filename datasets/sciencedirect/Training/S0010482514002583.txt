@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The analysis of biomedical signals demonstrating complexity through recurrence plots is challenging. Quantification of recurrences is often biased by sojourn points that hide dynamic transitions. To overcome this problem, time series have previously been embedded at high dimensions. However, no one has quantified the elimination of sojourn points and rate of detection, nor the enhancement of transition detection has been investigated. This paper reports our on-going efforts to improve the detection of dynamic transitions from logistic maps and fetal hearts by reducing sojourn points. Three signal-based recurrence plots were developed, i.e. embedded with specific settings, derivative-based and m-time pattern. Determinism, cross-determinism and percentage of reduced sojourn points were computed to detect transitions. For logistic maps, an increase of 50% and 34.3% in sensitivity of detection over alternatives was achieved by m-time pattern and embedded recurrence plots with specific settings, respectively, and with a 100% specificity. For fetal heart rates, embedded recurrence plots with specific settings provided the best performance, followed by derivative-based recurrence plot, then unembedded recurrence plot using the determinism parameter. The relative errors between healthy and distressed fetuses were 153%, 95% and 91%. More than 50% of sojourn points were eliminated, allowing better detection of heart transitions triggered by gaseous exchange factors. This could be significant in improving the diagnosis of fetal state.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Complexity analysis of biomedical time series by means of various descriptors including, but not limited to, fractal dimension [1], multi-fractal spectra [2], and entropies [3–5] is quantitative and currently standard practice.Large studies involving the analysis of biomedical systems and signals have recently used recurrence plots (RPs) that featured and located recurring states or patterns constituting the system׳s time series or variables in 2-dimensions [6–12]. Quantitative indicators named recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) have been computed in order to extract certain scalar indicators from RPs [13–15].One of the significant uses of RQA was in the detection of the various dynamic transitions of logistic maps [13,12,16]. In addition, the Determinism (DET) parameter was employed to quantify chaotic-periodic and periodic-chaotic transitions [13,12]. Such transitions were detected in two different ways. The first focused on the computation of RQA promptly from a single unembedded time series [16]. This method was appealing due to its simple mathematical formulation. However, quantification was biased and a poor transition detection rate was obtained due to the presence of sojourn points [13–15,8].The second method was based on embedding the time series [6,7,13,17]. Although this method required heavy computation, it reduced sojourn points empirically and promoted transition detection [13,12]. However, no one has yet quantified the improvement of the detection rate, nor identified whether it would be possible to enhance the transition detection rate. This leads us to the question regarding the best value of the embedding dimension that would allow the detection of all dynamic transitions.This paper describes our on-going efforts to extract and cleanly quantify the dynamic information from nonlinear dynamic systems such as the logistic map and the fetal heart. The aim was to improve the detection rate of transitions by eliminating sojourn points present in recurrence plots. For the logistic map, the transitions to be detected were periodic-chaotic and chaotic-periodic transitions, while for the fetal heart the states to be detected were healthy-distressed and distressed-healthy fetal heart rates (FHRs). The solution adopted consisted of eliminating sojourn points present in recurrence plots. Several RPs were employed to find an efficient solution to the above problems. The first empirical method comprised two plots with different embedding dimension values. As proposed in [16] the first plot required no embedding and was the unembedded RP. The second recurrence plot required an embedding dimension greater than 2, as suggested by Marwan et al. [13,12]. As the choice of the embedding dimension in the second method is often arbitrary, we developed a new method that comprised finding the optimal embedding dimension that minimized the number of sojourn points. We also developed two additional signal-based methods using the derivative concept and the m-time pattern concept, and compared them with the above plots.To quantify the levels of performance of the proposed approaches, each technique was applied to the nonlinear logistic map and to the FHR, and both the sensitivity and the specificity were assessed in each case.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the methods including the already existing RPs and the three signal-based recurrence plots developed. In Section 3, we set out the numerical results. Finally, in Section 4 we discuss the results, provide a general conclusion and suggest the future prospects of this work.
