@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper considers periodic preventive maintenance policies for a deteriorating repairable system. On each failure the system is repaired and, at the planned times, it is periodically maintained to improve its reliability performance. Most of periodic preventive maintenance (PM) models for repairable systems have been studied assuming that the failure process between two PMs follows the nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), implying the minimal repair on each failure. However, in this paper, we assume that the failure process between two PMs follows a new counting process which is a generalized version of the NHPP. We develop two types of PM models and study detailed properties of the optimal policies which minimize the long-run expected cost rates. Numerical examples are also provided.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the reliability area, various types of repairs have been developed based on different point processes and they have been applied for modeling the corresponding maintenance effects. After the classical maintenance model proposed by Barlow and Hunter (1960), mathematical sophistication of preventive maintenance models has increased. Comprehensive discussions on different maintenance models can be found in Canfield (1986), Nakagawa (1986), Nguyen and Murthy (1981) and Liu et al. (1995). More theoretical and sophisticated models have also been developed; see Aven and Jensen (2000), Cheng and Chen (2003), Marais and Saleh (2009), Mercier (2002), Mercier and Pham (2012), Vaughan (2005), Wang and Zhang (2013) and Chenetal (2015). See also Valdez-Flores and Feldman (1989), Wang (2002) and Tadj, Ouali, Yacout, and Ait-Kadi (2011) for surveys on various practical maintenance models. Nakagawa (2005) provides an overview on more theoretical maintenance models.Maintenance actions can generally be divided into two types: corrective maintenance (CM) and preventive maintenance (PM). For a deteriorating repairable system, the CM action is conducted upon failure to recover the system from a failure, whereas the PM action is performed at the planned time to improve the system reliability performance. Most of the periodic PM models for repairable systems have been studied assuming that the failure process between two PMs follows the nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), which implies that the repair type of the CM performed on each failure is the minimal repair (see, e.g., Cheng & Chen, 2003; Cheng, Zhao, Chen, & Sun, 2014; Nakagawa, 1986; Nguyen & Murthy, 1981; Park, Jung, & Yum, 2000). By the ‘minimal repair’, we mean that the state of the system after the repair is restored to the as-bad-as-old condition, i.e., to the state it had prior to the failure. As the failure process in this case follows the NHPP, the assumption of minimal repair generally allows a closed-form of results (e.g. the long-run expected cost rates) and nice mathematical properties for the optimal solutions in maintenance optimization.However, practically, when a component in a system fails, this may lead to a more hostile working environment through increased pressure, temperature, humidity, and so on, causing instantaneous stress or damage to the adjacent non-failed components. It eventually results in the system degradation and, hence, an increase in the level of the system failure rate function (see El-Damcese, 1997; Hoyland & Rausand, 1994; and Jeong, 2012). For example, (a) the failure of a still wire cable in a bridge or in an elevator instantaneously increases the stress on the remaining cables and leads to some damages before repairing the failed one; (b) for a multi-engine airplane, the failure of an engine during flight instantaneously causes increased stress on the non-failed engines until landing for the repair of the failed engine; (c) a failure of a pump in a multi pump hydraulic control system instantly increases the pressure for each non-failed pump until the repair of the failed one; (d) when an electric device fails by an external shock (electric or mechanical shock), the non-failed components also experience this external shock and their reliability performances can be worse than before.Under the situations illustrated above, after the repair of the failed component, the reliability performances of the non-failed components are worse than before the failure. Accordingly, the overall state of the system after the repair of the failed component is worse than the state it had just prior to the failure. As illustrated above, in practice, this type of ‘worse-than-minimal repair’ happens not because of a repair action (e.g., a faulty repair), but because of the negative effect caused by a failure in the system.Motivated by the above consideration, in this paper, we introduce a new repair type which is ‘worse-than-minimal repair’, based on the Generalized Polya Process (GPP). The GPP has been recently described based on the notion of stochastic intensity and its probabilistic properties have been studied in detail (Cha, 2014). It will be seen that this new repair process includes the minimal repair process as a special case and, accordingly, it is a generalized version of the minimal repair process. It will also be seen that the GPP relaxes the restrictive ‘independent increments property’ of the NHPP, which has an important practical meaning from maintenance modeling point of view (see Section 2). Then, assuming that the failure process between two PMs follows the GPP, we study and discuss a relevant maintenance optimization problem.The main objective of Cha (2014) was to study the probabilistic properties of the GPP. Then, it suggested a possible application of the GPP to a reliability problem by providing an example which applies the GPP to the simplest ‘replacement’ policy. On the other hand, in this current paper, we develop two types of PM models based on the new repair process, which combine CM, PM and replacement. In the two PM models, the system is preventively maintained (PM) at periodic times iT,i=1,2,…,N−1, and is replaced at NT (Replacement). The reliability improvement made by a PM is stochastically modeled based on the properties of the GPP. The failures of the system which occur between PMs are repaired by the new type of repair (CM). Thus, the corresponding PM policies are characterized by two PM parameters (N, T). For each model, we study detailed properties of the optimal PM policies (N*, T*) which minimize the long-run expected cost rates. Because the PM models in this paper are developed based on a new type of repair process instead of the conventional minimal repair process, the current work would suggest a new research direction in the study of PM.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce a new type of generalized repair which is worse-than-minimal-repair based on the GPP. We also interpret the involved parameter in the new repair process from the PM modeling point of view. In Section 3, we develop the two types of PM models. For each model, we derive the properties of the optimal policy and, based on them, we provide two-stage optimization procedure. In Section 4, numerical examples are provided for illustrations. Finally in Section 5, concluding remarks are given and further topics to be developed are suggested.Although the minimal repair process based on the NHPP has been a very useful tool for modeling the failure process of a repairable system, its practical limitation also exists. For instance, the NHPP possesses the independent increment property. This implies that the future failure process in this case does not depend on the failure history of the system. For instance, suppose that we have two systems at time t: one has experienced no failure until time t, whereas the other one has experienced frequent failures and has been minimally repaired until time t. Under the minimal repair assumption, these two systems have no statistical difference at all, e.g., their future failure rates are the same. On the other hand, as will be seen in this section, the GPP does not possess the independent increment property and, under the GPP repair assumption, the future reliability performance of a system becomes worse and worse as the number of system failures occurred in the past increases. Thus, from this practical point of view, the GPP repair can be understood as a practically more plausible assumption in maintenance modeling. Some recent works such as Babykina and Couallier (2014) and Le Gat (2014) have shown that the GPP is better fitted to some real field failure data sets than the traditional NHPP model.Note that one counting process corresponds to one repair type and vice versa. For instance, the ‘perfect repair’ corresponds to the renewal process and the ‘minimal repair’ corresponds to the NHPP. Thus, to define a new type of repair, we need a new counting process. We will now introduce the concept of stochastic intensity and, based on it, we provide the definition of the GPP.Let {N(t),  t ≥ 0} be an orderly point process andHt−≡{N(u),0≤u<t}be the history (internal filtration) of the process in [0, t), i.e., the set of all point events in [0, t). Observe thatHt−can equivalently be defined in terms ofN(t−)and the sequential arrival points of the eventsS0≡0≤S1≤S2≤...≤SN(t−)<tin [0, t), where Siis the time from 0 until the arrival of the ith event in [0, t). The point processes can be mathematically described by using the concept of the stochastic intensity (the intensity process) λt, t ≥ 0 (Aven & Jensen, 1999, 2000). As discussed in Cha and Finkelstein (2011), Finkelstein and Cha (2013) and Cha (2014), the stochastic intensity λtof an orderly point process {N(t),  t ≥ 0} is defined as the following limit:(1)λt=limΔt→0Pr[N(t,t+Δt)=1|Ht−]Δt=limΔt→0E[N(t,t+Δt)|Ht−]Δt,where N(t1, t2), t1 < t2, represents the number of events in [t1, t2). The stochastic intensity defined in (1) has the following heuristic interpretation:λtdt=E[dN(t)|Ht−], which is very similar to the ordinary failure rate or hazard rate of a random variable (Aven & Jensen, 1999). In the case of the NHPP with intensity function λ(t), the stochastic intensity is given by the ‘deterministic function’λt=λ(t),t≥0. In Cha (2014), the definition of the GPP is given as follows.Definition 1Generalized Polya Process (GPP)A counting process {N(t),  t ≥ 0} is called the Generalized Polya Process (GPP) with the set of parameters (λ(t), α, β), α ≥ 0, β > 0, if(i)N(0)=0;λt=(αN(t−)+β)λ(t).As mentioned in Cha (2014), the GPP with(λ(t),α=0,β=1)reduces to the NHPP with the intensity function λ(t) and, accordingly, the GPP can be understood as a generalized version of the NHPP. For our further discussion, we give here the following supplementary results on the GPP. The proofs are given in Cha (2014).Proposition 1Suppose that a counting process {N(t),  t ≥ 0} is the GPP with the set of parameters (λ(t), α, β), α ≥ 0, β > 0. ThenP(N(t)=n)=Γ(β/α+n)Γ(β/α)n!(1−exp{−αΛ(t)})n×(exp{−αΛ(t)})βα,n=0,1,2,…,whereΛ(t)≡∫0tλ(s)ds, andE[N(t)]=βα(exp{αΛ(t)}−1).Thus, it can be seen that the distribution of N(t) follows a negative binomial distribution with the corresponding parameters(exp{−αΛ(t)},β/α), where the probability mass function of the negative binomial random variable X with parameters (ρ, γ), where 0 < ρ < 1 and γ > 0, is defined asP(X=n)=Γ(γ+n)Γ(γ)n!(1−ρ)nργ,n=0,1,2,....Based on the GPP, we will now define a new type of repair, which is called the ‘GPP repair’. In the following discussions, we assume that the duration of a repair is negligible. Define {N(t),  t ≥ 0} as the failure process of the system with its failure rate λ(t) which undergoes a type of repair on each failure, where N(t) is the total number of failures in (0, t].Definition 2GPP repairFor a system with its failure rate λ(t), a repair type is called the ‘GPP repair’ with the parameter α if {N(t),  t ≥ 0} is the GPP with the parameter set (λ(t), α, 1).Thus, under the GPP repair process, the corresponding stochastic intensity is specified as(2)λt=(αN(t−)+1)λ(t).In Cha (2014), the GPP repair was defined via three parameters (λ(t), α, β). However, by suitable re-parametrization, we can have the same stochastic intensity with (2) and thus the same failure process. Throughout this paper, we will follow Definition 2 rather than relying on that given in Cha (2014) due to its simplicity.The parameter α determines the ‘degree of repair’. Obviously,α=0corresponds to the minimal repair and α > 0 implies that the repair is worse-than-minimal-repair. Furthermore, as α increases, the corresponding repair becomes worse and worse. For convenience, we will call λ(t) the baseline failure rate function and call the age which is defined based on the baseline failure rate function the intrinsic age.Now we will see how λtin (2) evolves in time depending on the system's failure history. Denote by 0 ≤ s1 ≤ s2 ≤ ... the realization of sequential failure times. Based on (2), before the first failure time s1,N(t−)=0and, the stochastic intensity for 0 < t ≤ s1 is given by λ(t). Thus, before the first failure, the stochastic intensity is the original failure rate of the system. Suppose now that the first failure has occurred at s1. Then, after this failure and before the second failure time s2,N(t−)=1, and, from (2), the stochastic intensity for s1 < t ≤ s2 is given by(α+1)λ(t). Now we suppose that the second failure has occurred at s2. Then, similarly from (2), the stochastic intensity for s2 < t ≤ s3 is given by(2α+1)λ(t), and so on. The shape of the evolving stochastic intensity λtwhich depends on the history is depicted in Fig. 1.Fig. 1 represents the stochastic intensities of the GPP repair processes withλ(t)=0.05t2+0.5forα=0andα=0.3, assuming that the system failures occurred at the points where “x” is marked. As shown in the figure, whenα=0(minimal repair process) the stochastic intensity is just given by the fixed baseline failure rate λ(t), which does not depend on the failure history. On the other hand, when α > 0, the stochastic intensity jumps at each failure point and thus, under the GPP repair process, after each failure, the state of the system becomes worse than before the failure.As mentioned before, the parameter α in Definition 2 can be understood as the ‘degree of repair’. Now we interpret the effect of the parameter α from the PM modeling point of view. For this, define the failure intensity function ϕ(t) as follows:ϕ(t)≡limΔt→0E[N(t,t+Δt)]Δt=dE[N(t)]dt,which is the mean number of failures per unit time at time t. From ϕ(t), E[N(t)] can be obtained asE[N(t)]=∫0tϕ(s)ds. Furthermore, from the definition of λt, ϕ(t) can also be expressed asϕ(t)=limΔt→0E[N(t,t+Δt)]Δt=limΔt→0E[E[N(t,t+Δt)|Ht−]Δt]=E[λt].Thus, it can be seen that ϕ(t) is the average of λt(with respect to all possible realizations of the history). Under the GPP repair process defined in Definition 2, using Proposition 1, ϕ(t) is specified asϕ(t)=λ(t)exp{αΛ(t)},t≥0.For the minimal repair process (α=0), ϕ(t) is clearly given byϕ(t)=λ(t), t ≥ 0. Fig. 2depicts the functions ϕ(t) for different values of α(α=0,0.2,0.4,0.6) whenλ(t)=0.05t2+0.5. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the larger alpha accelerates the deterioration, whereas smaller alpha decelerates it. Thus, under the GPP repair process, the parameter α determines the ‘deterioration rate’ of the system.In this section, we develop two periodic PM models (Models 1 and 2) for a repairable deteriorating system and discuss the properties of the optimal policies. In both of the two periodic PM models, the PMs and CMs, and Replacements are performed according to the following general periodic PM policy.GeneralperiodicPMpolicyThe system is preventively maintained (PM) at periodic times iT,i=1,2,…,N−1, and is replaced at NT(replacement). The failures of the system which occur between PMs are repaired by the GPP repair (CM). The durations of the repair and replacements are negligible.The CM action is performed upon failure to recover the system from its failure. We assume that the type of repair on each failure is the GPP repair. The actions for PM are performed periodically at planned periodic times to improve the system reliability performance. Typical examples of PM action include oil changes or lubrication (for mechanical systems), inspection and adjustment, cleaning, reduction of the increased stress or damage, replacement or repair of some components, and so on. Generally, the effect of a PM action can be modeled via the failure intensity function (or failure rate function) and it can be classified into the following three categories:(i)Failure intensity (or failure rate) reduction (e.g., Cheng et al., 2014; Lie & Chun, 1986; Pongpech & Murthy, 2006).Deceleration of the deteriorating process, that is, the decrease of the deterioration speed (e.g., Canfield, 1986; Cheng, Chen, & Guo, 2007; Park et al., 2000).Age reduction (e.g., Kijima, 1989; Levitin & Lisnianski, 2000).Frequently, a PM model belongs to more than one category (hybrid PM models). See, e.g., El-Ferik and Ben-Daya (2006), Lin, Zuo, and Yam (2000), Sheu and Chang (2009).In PM Model 1, the effect of a PM action is modeled by categories (i) and (ii), whereas, in PM Model 2, categories (i) and (iii) are captured. By a replacement, the system is returned to as-good-as-new state.Under the two specific PM models to be defined in the following subsections, the aim of this paper is to find the optimal maintenance policy parameters (N*, T*) which minimize the long-run average cost rate. In these PM models, we assume that the initial failure process of the system without such periodic PM follows the GPP with the set of parameters (λ(t), α0, 1).Generally, PM reduces the failure intensity and numerous PM models include the failure intensity reduction. On the other hand, the “Operation of systems causes stress which results in system degradation and, hence, an increase in the level of the hazard function with time. PM is assumed to relieve stress and, hence, slow the rate of system degradation” (see El-Damcese, 1997). Thus, in Model 1, the effect of a PM action will be modeled by (1) Failure intensity reduction and (2) Deceleration of the deteriorating process. As mentioned before, the initial failure process during (0, T] follows the GPP with the set of parameters (λ(t), α0, 1). The assumptions of Model 1 for modeling the above PM effects are stated as follows.Assumptions of Model 1The failure process during(iT,(i+1)T]follows the GPP with the set of parameters(λ(iT+t),αPM,1),i=1,2,…,(N−1), where 0 < αPM< α0.At time T, the first PM is performed. Then, according to the above assumption, the failure process of the system in the interval (T, 2T] will follow the GPP with the set of parameters(λ(T+t),αPM,1), and that in the interval (2T, 3T] will follow the GPP with the set of parameters(λ(2T+t),αPM,1), and so on.The above assumption means that the failure processes in the PM intervals(iT,(i+1)T],i=1,2,…,N−1, follow piecewisely the GPP with the corresponding parameter(λ(iT+t),αPM,1), respectively. Thus, by the above assumption, the piecewise stochastic intensity (at time t from the PM time iT) in the ith PM period(iT,(i+1)T], denoted byλtPM(i), is given by(3)λtPM(i)=(α0NiT(t−)+1)λ(t),t∈(0,T],i=0,λtPM(i)=(αPMNiT(t−)+1)λ(iT+t),t∈(0,T],i=1,2,…,N−1,where NiT(t) is the number of failures in(iT,iT+t], 0 < t ≤ T,i=0,1,2,…,N−1, under the above PM model. Combining the piecewise stochastic intensitiesλtPM(i)in (3), the evolving stochastic intensityλtPMwhich depends on the history is depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 is an example obtained by assuming that the failures occurred at the points where “x” is marked.To compare the effect of the PM with the case without PM and the case of minimal repair, let us define the failure intensity function of the system under the above PM ϕPM(t) as follows:ϕPM(t)=E[λtPM],t∈(0,NT],which is the average ofλtPM(with respect to all possible realizations of the history) and also represents the mean number of failures per unit time at time t. In Fig. 4, ϕPM(t) is provided along with the failure intensity functions for the cases when there is no PM and when the minimal repair process is applied.As can be seen from Fig. 4, ϕPM(t) is between the intensity function of the minimal repair process and that for the case when there is no PM. Fig. 5shows more detailed failure intensity change due to the PM and the effect of PM can be interpreted step by step based on it. In Fig. 5, the function ϕPM(t) is depicted for the interval (0, 3.5].Thus, just after the first PM at T, (Step 1) the failure intensity value is reduced to that of minimal repair process λ(T) (failure intensity reduction), and then (Step 2) the deterioration parameter is reduced to αPM(deceleration of the deteriorating process).Remark 1(i) In PM Model 1, we assume that a PM always involves the same set of actions and thus it takes the same cost. However, the PM action can reduce the failure intensity larger as the system ages because such PM action is generally more effective when the system is more deteriorated (or more aged).(ii) Furthermore, we assume that, after a PM, the failure rate is reduced to the level equivalent to that of the minimal repair process. However, our PM Model 1 can have more flexibility by incorporating another parameter 0 < κ < 1 and by assuming that:“The failure process during(iT,(i+1)T]follows the GPP with the set of parameters(κλ(iT+t),αPM,1),i=1,2,…,(N−1), where 0 < κ < 1 and 0 < αPM< α0.”In this case, after a PM, the failure rate is reduced to a level which is less than that of the minimal repair process as in Model 2.We will now obtain the expected cost rate of Model 1 as the function of (N, T), which is denoted by C1(N, T). Let cGPPbe the cost of a GPP repair, cpmbe the cost of a PM, and crbe the cost of a replacement. Let NGPbe the total number of GPP repairs performed in the renewal cycle. Note that the length of one renewal cycle is NT. Then, obviously, the long-run average cost rate function C1(N, T) can be expressed asC1(N,T)=cGPPE[NGP]+cpm(N−1)+crNT.From Proposition 1, the expected number of GPP repairs in ith PM period(iT,(i+1)T]is given by1α0(exp{α0∫0Tλ(t)dt}−1),i=0,and1αPM(exp{αPM∫0Tλ(iT+t)dt}−1),i=1,…,N−1.Thus, the long-run expected cost rate C1(N, T) is given byC1(N,T)=1NT(cGPP[1α0(exp{α0∫0Tλ(t)dt}−1)+∑i=2N1αPM(exp{αPM∫0Tλ((i−1)T+t)dt}−1)]+cpm(N−1)+cr),N=1,2,…,T>0,where, by convention,∑i=2N(·)=0ifN=1.Replacement of a number of components in the system not only reduces the failure intensity, but also can make the system younger. Thus, in Model 2, the effect of a PM action will be modeled by (1) Failure intensity reduction and (2) Age reduction and the deterioration parameter α0 will not be changed. As before, the failure processes in the PM intervals(iT,(i+1)T],i=1,2,…,N−1, will follow piecewisely the GPP. Let vn(T) be the starting intrinsic age of the GPP just after the nth PM, which depends on both n and T. Then, this implies that the baseline failure rate function just after the nth PM is given byλ(vn(T)+t), instead ofλ(nT+t), and the failure intensity value just after nth PM, ϕPM(nT), is given byϕPM(nT)=λ(vn(T)). The detailed assumptions of Model 2 for modeling the PM effect are stated as follows.Assumptions of Model 2The failure process during[(i−1)T,iT)follows the GPP with the set of parameters(λ(vi−1(T)+t),α0,1),i=1,2,…,N, wherev0(T)=0andvj−1(T)<vj(T),j=1,2,…,N−1, and vj(T) is non-decreasing in T.Note that the starting age defined above is very similar to the concept of the virtual age proposed by Kijima (1989). In Model 2, the assumption for vn(T) is thatvj−1(T)<vj(T),j=1,2,…,N−1, and vj(T) is non-decreasing in T. Now, we can consider some specific models satisfying this assumption. Practical examples for vn(T) can be, similar to Kijima's Virtual Age Model 1: (i)vn(T)=vn−1(T)+θT; and, Model 2: (ii)vn(T)=θ(vn−1(T)+T), respectively,n=1,2,…, with v0(T) ≡ 0, where the factor θ, 0 < θ ≤ 1, represents the degree of the PM efficiency (see also Section 4 for more detailed examples). Generally, Kijima's Model 1 is practically more appropriate because the virtual age in this case is not bounded and, in our further consideration and examples, we will consider this type of virtual age model. The stochastic intensityλtPMof PM Model 2 is depicted in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 is an example obtained by assuming that the failures occurred at the points where “x” is marked.Fig. 7depicts the corresponding failure intensity function ϕPM(t) for PM Model 2 along with those for the cases when there is no PM and when the minimal repair process is applied.Fig. 8shows the failure intensity change due to the PM in a more detail and the effect of PM can be interpreted step by step. In Fig. 8, the function ϕPM(t) is depicted for the interval (0, 3.5].Thus, just after PM at T, (Step 1) the failure intensity value is reduced to that of the minimal repair process λ(T) (failure intensity reduction), and then (Step 2) the age is reduced tov1(T)=0.8T(age reduction).We will now obtain the expected cost rate of Model 2, C2(N, T). Observe that, under Model 2, the expected number of the GPP repairs in the ith PM period((i−1)T,iT]is, from Proposition 1,1α0(exp{α0∫0Tλ(vi−1(T)+t)dt}−1),i=1,2,…,N,and thus by the similar manner as before the long-run expected cost rate C2(N, T) is given byC2(N,T)=cGPP∑i=1N(1α0(exp{α0∫0Tλ(vi−1(T)+t)dt}−1))+cpm(N−1)+crNT,N=1,2,…,T>0.For each k,k=1,2, we discuss how to find the optimal maintenance policy parameters(Nk*,Tk*)such thatCk(Nk*,Tk*)=minT>0,N=1,2,…Ck(N,T),k=1,2.To find(Nk*,Tk*), we will follow the following two stage procedure. At the first stage, for a fixed T > 0, we findNk*(T)which satisfies(4)Ck(Nk*(T),T)=minN=1,2,…Ck(N,T).At the second stage, we search forTk*such that(5)Ck(Nk*(Tk*),Tk*)=minT>0Ck(Nk*(T),T).The following theorem provides the properties of the optimalNk*(T)in (4) in the first stage. The proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix A.1.Theorem 1Suppose that λ(t) is strictly increasing and convex. For a given T > 0, let, for Model 1,L1(N;T)≡N1αPM(exp{αPM∫0Tλ(NT+t)dt}−1)−∑i=1N−11αPM(exp{αPM∫0Tλ(iT+t)dt}−1)−1α0(exp{α0∫0Tλ(t)dt}−1),N=1,2,…,and, for Model 2,L2(N;T)≡N1α0(exp{α0∫0Tλ(vN(T)+t)dt}−1)−∑i=1N1α0(exp{α0∫0Tλ(vi−1(T)+t)dt}−1),N=1,2,….Then,(i)Lk(N; T) is strictly increasing in N andLk(∞;T)≡limN→∞Lk(N;T)=∞.(case a) IfLk(1;T)<cr−cpmcGPP, then there exists n ≥ 2 such thatLk(n−1;T)<cr−cpmcGPPandLk(n;T)≥cr−cpmcGPP,(case b) IfLk(1;T)>cr−cpmcGPPthenNk*(T)=1. IfLk(1;T)=cr−cpmcGPP, thenNk*(T)=1andNk*(T)=2.Note that Lk(N; T) in Theorem 1 can be expressed asLk(N;T)=Ck(N+1,T)−Ck(N,T)cGPPN(N+1)T−cpm−crcGPP.Thus,Ck(N+1,T)−Ck(N,T)>(=,<)0⇔Lk(N;T)>(=,<)cr−cpmcGPP.Due to result (i) of Theorem 1, in (case a), Ck(N, T) initially decreases and then strictly increases and there existsNk*(T)≥2, which is unique or not, depending on the given conditions. In (case b), Ck(N, T) strictly increases and thus ‘Nk*(T)=1’ or ‘Nk*(T)=1andNk*(T)=2’, depending on the given conditions.Now, we discuss how to simplify the second stage. At the second stage, if we could find a positive value of T, say TU, such thatminT∈[0,TU]Ck(Nk*(T),T)<minT∈(TU,∞)Ck(Nk*(T),T),then, the search forTk*in the second stage (5) can be performed in the reduced parameter set [0, TU], instead of [0, ∞). Thus, e.g., the grid search for findingTk*can be limited only to the set [0, TU].The following theorem provides such upper bound forTk*. The proof of Theorem 2 is given in Appendix A.2. Before stating the theorem, we briefly give the logic for finding such upper bound, which will provide some intuition on the result given below. To find the upper bound forTk*, first, we will find T1 such thatLk(1;T)>cr−cpmcGPPforallT>T1,which implies that, Ck(N, T) strictly increases in N, for all T > T1, and thusNk*(T)=1, for all T > T1. Intuitively, there should be such T1 because, when the PM interval is too long, the system should be replaced at the first PM time T (without any PM). Thus, for T > T1, Ck(N, T) > Ck(1, T), for allN=2,3,…, and any (N, T) such thatN=2,3,…and T > T1 cannot be the optimal solution. Now suppose that we can find T2 such that Ck(1, T) is strictly increasing for all T > T2. Then, the above arguments will imply that for any fixed T > TU≡ max (T1, T2), we haveNk*(T)=1andCk(Nk*(T),T)=Ck(1,T)strictly increases in T for T > TU≡ max (T1, T2). Therefore, (N, T) such thatN=1,2,3,…and T > TU≡ max (T1, T2) cannot be the optimal solution and we could conclude thatTk*∉(TU,∞).Theorem 2Assume that λ(t) is strictly increasing for both models and additionally assume for Model 1 that(6)∫T2Tλ(t)dt∫0Tλ(t)dt>α0αPMforallT>0.Then an upper bound for the optimalTk*, denoted by TU, is given byTU=max(T1,T2), where T1is the unique solution of the equationLk(1;T)=cr−cpmcGPPand T2is the unique solution of the equationexp{α0∫0Tλ(t)dt}{α0λ(T)T−1}=α0crcGPP−1Numerical examples for finding the set of optimal solutions(Nk*,Tk*)will be provided in the next section.Remark 2(i) In Theorem 2, the condition (6) is not too restrictive. For example, for Weibull failure rateλ(t)=θγtγ−1, the condition (6) becomes∫T2Tλ(t)dt∫0Tλ(t)dt=2γ−1>α0αPM,foranyθ>0.Depending on the parameters γ, α0 and αPM, this condition can be fulfilled (see the corresponding examples in Section 4), especially when the difference between α0 and αPMis not so large, which will be often the case in PM practice.(ii) Practically, the reliability performance of the system becomes worse and worse as the cycle of the PM increases. Thus, in Model 1, it would be reasonable to satisfy(7)1α0(exp{α0∫0Tλ(t)dt}−1)<1αPM(exp{αPM∫0Tλ(T+t)dt}−1),and(8)1αPM(exp{αPM∫0Tλ(iT+t)dt}−1)<1αPM(exp{αPM∫0Tλ((i+1)T+t)dt}−1),i=1,2,…,for any T ≥ 0, which imply that, for any PM policy, the mean number of the system failures in a PM cycle strictly increases as the cycle increases. The condition in (8) obviously holds when λ(t) is strictly increasing, whereas it can be easily shown that the condition (6) is a sufficient condition for (7). Thus, it would be practically reasonable to apply Model 1 when the weak condition (6) is fulfilled (see also the corresponding examples in Section 4).In this section, we will provide numerical examples for illustrations. In all the examples, it is assumed that the baseline failure rate function is given byλ(t)=0.01t2, t ≥ 0. Consider first Model 1. In order to find(N1*,T1*), we follow two stage procedure stated in Section 3. In this case, we can obtain the upper bound TUfor the optimalT1*using Theorem 2. Thus, at the first stage, we fix T ∈ (0, TU] and we findN1*(T)which satisfiesC1(N1*(T),T)=minN=1,2,...C1(N,T),using Theorem 1. At this stage, in our numerical examples, there was unique optimalN1*(T)for each T ∈ (0, TU]. At the second stage, to findT1*we perform a full grid search in (0, TU] and we determineT1*such thatC1(N1*(T1*),T1*)=minT∈(0,TU]C1(N1*(T),T).Following the above procedure, the optimal(N1*,T1*)andC1(N1*,T1*)for different values of αPM, cpmand cr, when α0 and cGPPare fixed asα0=0.5andcGPP=0.2, are obtained and they are given in Table 1. For example, whencr=40,cpm=2,αPM=0.2, the condition in Theorem 2 is satisfied and, following the optimization procedure described above, the optimalT1*andN1*(T1*)are obtained byT1*=4.3273andN1*(T1*)=4. In this case, the minimum cost rate is given byC1(N1*(T1*),T1*)=3.1594.For Model 2, we consider the virtual age model withvn(T)=vn−1(T)+θT. Thus, under this setting, the virtual age function after the nth PM, vn(T), is given byv0(T)=0,vn(T)=θnT,n=1,…,N−1.Based on Theorems 1 and 2, the optimal(N2*,T2*)and the corresponding minimum cost rate are obtained following the similar two stage optimization procedure, for different values of θ, cpmand cr, when α0 and cGPPare fixed asα0=0.5andcGPP=0.2. The results are given in Table 2.If we fix cpmand αPM(in Model 1) or fix cpmand θ (in Model 2), and increase cr, then, one could expect that the replacement time should become larger because a replacement becomes more expensive. As can be seen from the tables,Nk*Tk*is monotonically increasing as crincreases. Furthermore, in this case, the relative PM cost becomes less expensive and there should be more frequent PM's. Thus,Tk*is monotonically decreasing. If we fix crand αPM(or crand θ), and decrease cpm, we can interpret the results in a similar way because the relative PM cost becomes less expensive in this case compared with the cost for a GPP repair and that for a replacement.Now, we fix crand cpm, and increase αPMor θ. In this case, the PM becomes less efficient and the replacement should be performed earlier. Thus the replacement timeNk*Tk*is decreasing. Also, even when the PM is less efficient, there is still the effect of failure intensity reduction on each PM and PMs should be performed more frequently to compensate for the decreased PM effect. This results in the decrease inTk*(except for the case forNk*=1when no PM is performed). Note that in Table 2, ifN2*=1, the optimal PM policies are the same for different values of θ and cpmwhen cris fixed. This is due to the fact that the system is just replaced atT2*and is not affected by the effect of PM whenN2*=1.Comparing Models 1 and 2, especially when cpmis large, the optimal valuesN1*andT1*of Model 1 are relatively robust against the change of the parameter αPM. On the other hand, the optimal valuesN2*andT2*of Model 2 are very sensitive to the change of the parameter θ. This result seems to be due to the following facts: in our example, a strictly increasing convex functionλ(t)=0.01t2is used as the baseline failure rate function. Thus, even a small decrease in θ in PM Model 2 can result in a relatively large reduction in the baseline failure rate function after each PM. In turn, the optimal valuesN2*andT2*may be quite greatly influenced by such large changes of the corresponding PM model.In this paper, we defined a new repair process based on the GPP and discussed the relevant maintenance optimization. Two periodic PM models were considered and the optimal PM policy was discussed for each model. In the first model, the effect of a PM action was modeled by (1) Failure intensity reduction and (2) Deceleration of the deteriorating process. On the other hand, in the second PM model, it was modeled by (1) Failure intensity reduction and (2) Age reduction. For each model, we studied detailed properties of the optimal PM policies which minimize the long-run expected cost rates. In searching for the optimal PM policy, we developed a two-stage optimization procedure. At the first stage, we provided the explicit method for finding the optimal number of PM intervals for a given length of an interval, and, at the second stage, we suggested an upper bound for the optimal length of a PM interval. Combining these results, the optimal PM policy could be obtained efficiently. The obtained results were applied to several numerical examples. We interpreted the effect of relative change of the involved cost parameters and that of change of the PM efficiency parameters.In the literature, numerous studies of preventive maintenance optimization have been performed assuming minimal repairs between PMs. However, from a practical point of view, the assumption of a minimal repair has a drawback. For instance, due to the independent increments property of the NHPP, the future reliability performance of the repaired system does not depend on the failure and repair history at all. On the other hand, under the GPP repair assumption, the future reliability performance of a system becomes worse and worse as the number of system failures in the past increases. Therefore, the assumption of the GPP repair could be regarded as a practically plausible one.Furthermore, in the reliability area, numerous new repair types have been developed and suggested, generalizing the minimal repair. However, in most of those studies, mathematical calculations are not tractable and, generally, it is very difficult to study the properties of the optimal maintenance policy. The repair type defined based on the GPP can also be understood as a generalized version of the minimal repair and it allows a clear interpretation of the modeling parameter on the effect of the repair. Under the GPP repair assumption, the results in this paper were mostly obtained in closed forms. In future studies, the assumption of the GPP repair could also be applied to other topics in the reliability area as an alternative to the minimal repair when it is appropriate.
