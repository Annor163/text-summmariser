@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Entropy is used as a quantitative measurement of the information deficiency. In uncertain set theory, logarithm entropy for uncertain set has been proposed. However, it fails to measure the degree of uncertainty associated with some uncertain sets. Thus this paper will propose sine entropy for uncertain set as a supplement, and investigate its properties such as translation invariance and positive linearity. Besides, it proposes sine relative entropy for uncertain set, and gives its applications in portfolio selection and clustering.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Entropy, a quantitative measure of the information, was first proposed for a random variable by Shannon [22] in the form of logarithm in 1948. Then quadratic entropy was presented by Vaida [23] as a supplement to measure the information deficiency of a random variable in 1968. As we know, given the variance and the expected value of a random variable, there are many probability distributions meeting with the constraints. In this case, Jaynes [12] proposed the maximum entropy principle, that is to choose the probability distribution with the maximum entropy.In 1965, Zadeh [25] proposed a concept of fuzzy set via membership function to model the fuzzy event. Then fuzzy inference based on fuzzy set was widely applied in engineering and other areas. An application of fuzzy inference in spatial analysis was given by Arabacioglu [1], in which he employed Mamdami inference system to analyze the architectural space and showed that the system performs very well even with imprecise data. In 1968, Zadeh [26] introduced entropy to fuzzy set as a measure of the fuzziness. After that, the concept of entropy for fuzzy set was refined by De Luca and Termini [7] in 1972, and further studied by many researchers such as Pal and Bezdek [20], and Yager [24].In order to deal with human uncertainty, many theories has been proposed such as Dempster-Shafer theory (Dempster [8], Shafer [21]). In 2007, Liu [14] proposed a branch of axiomatic mathematics to deal with human uncertainty, which is called uncertainty theory. Then Liu [15] proposed a concept of entropy for uncertain variable, which was further studied by Chen, Dai and their co-workers [3,5,6]. Uncertain variable is used to model the quantity in the status of uncertainty. In order to model the unsharp concepts, Liu [16] proposed a concept of uncertain set as a generalization of uncertain variable, and applied it to uncertain inference. In 2010, Gao, Gao and Ralescu [9] extended the uncertain inference rule to the case with multiple antecedents and multiple if-then rules. After that, Gao [10] balanced an inverted pendulum by using the uncertain controller. In addition, uncertain set has also been used to multi-valued logic. In 2011, Chen and Ralescu [4] gave a formula to calculate the truth value of an uncertain proposition, and Liu [17] gave an application of uncertain logic in modelling human language. After that, the concept of uncertain set was refined by Liu [19] in 2012.Entropy for uncertain set has been proposed by Liu [17] as a measure of information deficiency in the form of logarithm function. However, it cannot measure the uncertainty associated with all uncertain set. Thus we will propose sine entropy for uncertain set as a supplement in this paper, and investigate its main properties such as translation invariance and positive linearity. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. The next section is intended to introduce some concepts of uncertain set and membership function. Then we introduce the concept of sine entropy in Section 3, and propose a formula to calculate sine entropy via inverse membership function in Section 4. After that, a concept of sine relative entropy is presented in Section 5, and its applications in portfolio selection and clustering are given in Sections 6 and 7, respectively. At last, we discuss the relationship between uncertainty theory, probability theory, and fuzzy theory for readers to better understand the paper in Section 8.Uncertainty theory is a branch of axiomatic mathematics based on normality, duality, subadditivity and product axioms. The basic and essential definition in uncertainty theory is uncertain measure.Definition 1(Liu [14]) LetLbe a σ-algebra on a nonempty set Γ. A set functionM:L→[0,1]is called an uncertain measure if it satisfies the following axioms:Axiom 1: (Normality Axiom)M{Γ}=1for the universal set Γ.: (Duality Axiom)M{Λ}+M{Λc}=1for any event Λ.: (Subadditivity Axiom) For every countable sequence of events Λ1, Λ2, …, we haveM{⋃i=1∞Λi}≤∑i=1∞M{Λi}.Besides, the product uncertain measure on the product σ-algebreLis defined by Liu [15] as follows,: (Product Axiom) Let(Γk,Lk,Mk)be uncertainty spaces for k=1, 2, …. Then the product uncertain measureMon the product σ-algebraL1×L2×⋯×Lkis an uncertain measure satisfyingM{∏i=1∞Λk}=⋀k=1∞Mk{Λk}where Λkare arbitrarily chosen events fromLkfor k=1, 2, …, respectively.Now, we introduce definitions of uncertain set and membership function as well as their operational law.Definition 2(Liu [19]) An uncertainty set is a measurable function ξ from an uncertainty space(Γ,L,M)to a collection of sets of real numbers, i.e., for any Borel set B of real numbers, the following two sets{ξ⊂B}={γ∈Γ|ξ(γ)⊂B},{B⊂ξ}={γ∈Γ|B⊂ξ(γ)}are events.The union and intersection of uncertain sets ξ and η are defined as (ξ∪η)(γ)=ξ(γ)∪η(γ) and (ξ∩η)(γ)=ξ(γ)∩η(γ) for every γ∈Γ, respectively. They are also uncertain sets.Definition 3(Liu [19]) An uncertain set ξ is said to have a membership function μ if the equationsM{ξ⊂B}=infx∈Bμ(x)M{B⊂ξ}=1−supx∈Bcμ(x)holds for any Borel set B of real numbers.Liu [16] proved that a real-valued function μ is a membership function if and only if 0≤μ(x)≤1. A membership function is said to be regular if there exists a point x0 such that μ(x0)=1 and μ(x) is unimodal about the point x0. Triangular uncertain set (a, b, c) is a type of frequently used uncertain sets with a membership functionμ(x)=x−ab−a,ifa≤x≤bx−cb−c,ifb≤x≤cshown in Fig. 1. Trapezoidal uncertain set ξ=(a, b, c, d) is another type of frequent used uncertain sets with a membership functionμ(x)=x−ab−a,ifa≤x≤b1,ifb≤x≤cx−dc−d,ifc≤x≤dshown in Fig. 2.Based on membership function, a concept of entropy for uncertain set was proposed in the form of logarithm function.Definition 4(Liu [17]) Suppose that ξ is an uncertain set with a membership function μ. Then its entropy is defined byL[ξ]=∫−∞+∞−μ(x)lnμ(x)−(1−μ(x))ln(1−μ(x))dx.In order to represent the average value of an uncertain set in the sense of uncertain measure, a concept of expected value was defined by means of membership function.Definition 5(Liu [16]) Let ξ be an uncertain set with regular membership function μ. Then the expected value E[ξ] of an uncertain set ξ is defined byE[ξ]=x0+12∫x0+∞μ(x)dx−12∫−∞x0μ(x)dxwhere x0 is a point such that μ(x0)=1.A rectangular uncertain set ξ=(a, b) with a membership function μ(x)=1[a,b](x) has an expected value E[ξ]=(a+b)/2. A triangular uncertain set η=(a, b, c) has an expected value E[η]=(a+2b+c)/4, and a trapezoidal uncertain set τ=(a, b, c, d) has an expected value E[τ]=(a+b+c+d)/4.Theorem 1Liu[19], Linearity of Expected Value) Let ξ and η be independent uncertain sets with regular uncertain memberships. Then for any real numbers a and b, we haveE[aξ+bη]=aE[ξ]+bE[η].Definition 6(Liu [19]) Let ξ be an uncertain set with a regular membership function μ. Defineμ−1(α)={x∈R|μ(x)≥α},∀α∈[0,1].Then the functionμl−1(α)=infμ−1(α)is called left inverse membership function of ξ, and the functionμr−1(α)=supμ−1(α)is called right inverse membership function of ξ.Note thatμl−1(α)is increasing andμr−1(α)is decreasing with respect to α. Inverse membership functions are the main tools in the operation of uncertain sets.Theorem 2(Liu[19]) Let ξ1, ξ2, …, ξnbe independent uncertain sets with regular inverse membership functionsμ1−1,μ2−1,…,μn−1, respectively. If the function f is increasing with respect to x1, x2, …, xmand decreasing with respect to xm+1, xm+2, …, xn, thenξ=f(ξ1,ξ2,…,ξn)is an uncertain set with left and right inverse membership functionsλl−1(α)=f(μ1l−1(α),…,μml−1(α),μm+1,r−1(α),…,μnr−1(α)),λr−1(α)=f(μ1r−1(α),…,μmr−1(α),μm+1,l−1(α),…,μnl−1(α)).Theorem 3(Liu[19]) Let ξ be an uncertain set with a regular membership function μ. ThenE[ξ]=12∫01(μl−1(α)+μr−1(α))dα.Corollary 1Let ξ1, ξ2, …, ξnbe independent uncertain sets with regular inverse membership functionsμ1−1,μ2−1,…,μn−1, respectively. Then for a strictly increasing function f(x1, …, xn), we haveE[f(ξ1,…,ξn)]=12∫01(f(μ1l−1(α),…,μnl−1(α))+f(μ1r−1(α),…,μnr−1(α)))dα.In this section, we will propose a concept of sine entropy for uncertain set, and give an estimation about its upper and lower bounds. Besides, we will prove the sine entropy behaves translation invariance, that is, the sine entropy keeps invariant under arbitrary translation.Definition 7Suppose that ξ is an uncertain set with a membership function μ. Then its sine entropy of ξ is defined byS[ξ]=∫−∞+∞sin(πμ(x))dx.Remark 1Note that the logarithm entropy cannot measure the uncertainty of all uncertain set. In this case, sine entropy could work as a supplement. Consider an uncertain set ξ with a membership functionμ(x)=e(|x|+e)ln2(|x|+e),∀x∈R.The logarithm entropy isL[ξ]=∫−∞+∞−μ(x)lnμ(x)−(1−μ(x))ln(1−μ(x))dx=2∫0+∞−μ(x)lnμ(x)−(1−μ(x))ln(1−μ(x))dx≥2∫0+∞−μ(x)lnμ(x)dx=∫0+∞−e(x+e)ln2(x+e)lne(x+e)ln2(x+e)dx=∫0+∞e(x+e)ln(x+e)+elnln(x+e)(x+e)ln2(x+e)−e(x+e)ln2(x+e)dx.Since∫0+∞e(x+e)ln(x+e)dx=+∞,∫0+∞elnln(x+e)(x+e)ln2(x+e)dx<+∞,and∫0+∞e(x+e)ln2(x+e)dx<+∞,we have L[ξ]=+∞. For the sine entropy, we haveS[ξ]=∫−∞+∞sin(πμ(x))dx=2∫0+∞sin(πμ(x))dx=2∫0+∞sinπe(x+e)ln2(x+e)dx.Sincesinπe(x+e)ln2(x+e)∼πe(x+e)ln2(x+e)when x is large enough, and the right term is integrable on [0, +∞), we have S[ξ]<+∞.Example 1The rectangular uncertain set ξ=(a, b) with a membership functionμ(x)=1,ifa≤x≤b0,otherwisehas an entropyS[ξ]=∫−∞asin(π·0)dx+∫absin(π·1)dx+∫b+∞sin(π·0)dx=0.Example 2The triangular uncertain set ξ=(a, b, c) with a membership functionμ(x)=x−ab−a,ifa≤x≤bx−cb−c,ifb≤x≤chas an entropyS[ξ]=∫−∞asin(π·0)dx+∫absin(π·x−ab−a)dx+∫bcsin(π·x−cb−c)dx+∫c+∞sin(π·0)dx=0+2π(b−a)+2π(c−b)+0=2π(c−a).Example 3The trapezoidal uncertain set ξ=(a, b, c, d) with a membership functionμ(x)=x−ab−a,ifa≤x≤b1,ifb≤x≤cx−dc−d,ifc≤x≤dhas an entropyS[ξ]=∫absinπ·x−ab−adx+∫bcsin(π·1)dx+∫cdsinπ·x−dc−ddx=2π(b−a)+0+2π(d−c)=2π(b−a+d−c).Theorem 4Let ξ be an uncertain set. Then S[ξ]≥0 and equality holds if ξ is a classical set.ProofLet μ(x) be the membership function of ξ. Since sin(πμ(x))≥0 for anyx∈R,we have S[ξ]≥0. Besides, when the uncertain set degenerates to a classical set, its entropy becomes 0.□Theorem 5Let ξ be an uncertain set on the interval [a, b]. ThenS[ξ]≤(b−a),and the equality holds if ξ has a membership function μ(x)=0.5 on [a, b].ProofNote that sin(πt) reaches its maximum value 1 at t=0.5. ThusS[ξ]=∫absin(πμ(x))dx≤∫abdx=b−a,and the equality holds when μ(x)=0.5 on [a, b].Theorem 6(Translation Invariance) Let ξ be an uncertain set. Then for any given real number c, we haveS[ξ+c]=S[ξ].ProofLet μ(x) denote the membership function of ξ. Then the uncertain set ξ+c has a membership function μ(x+c). It follows from the definition of sine entropy thatS[ξ+c]=∫01sin(πμ(x+c))dx=∫01sin(πμ(x))dx=S[ξ].The theorem is thus verified.□In this section, we will derive an formula to calculate the sine entropy of an uncertain set via inverse membership functions. Based on the formula, we prove that the sine entropy behaves positive linearity property.Theorem 7Assume ξ is an uncertain set with a regular membership function μ. If S[ξ] exists, thenS[ξ]=π∫01μr−1(α)−μl−1(α)cos(πα)dα.ProofSince ξ has a regular membership function μ, we haveS[ξ]=∫−∞+∞sin(πμ(x))dx=∫−∞x0sin(πμ(x))dx+∫x0+∞sin(πμ(x))dx=∫−∞x0∫0μ(x)πcos(πα)dαdx+∫x0+∞∫0μ(x)πcos(πα)dαdx.It follows from Fubini theorem thatS[ξ]=∫01∫μl−1(α)x0πcos(πα)dxdα+∫01∫x0μr−1(α)πcos(πα)dxdα=π∫01(x0−μl−1(α))cos(πα)dα+π∫01(μr−1(α)−x0)cos(πα)dα=π∫01μr−1(α)−μl−1(α)cos(πα)dα.The theorem is thus verified.□Example 4The triangular uncertain set ξ=(a, b, c) has a right inverse membership functionμr−1(α)=c+(b−c)αand a left inverse membership functionμr−1(α)=a+(b−a)α.By Theorem 7, we haveS[ξ]=π∫01(c+(b−c)α−a−(b−a)α)cos(πα)dα=π(c−a)∫01cos(πα)dα−π(c−a)∫01αcos(πα)dα=2π(c−a).Example 5The trapezoidal uncertain set ξ=(a, b, c, d) has a right inverse membership functionμr−1(α)=d+(c−d)αand a left inverse membership functionμr−1(α)=a+(b−a)α.By Theorem 7, we haveS[ξ]=π∫01(d+(c−d)α−a−(b−a)α)cos(πα)dα=π(d−a)∫01cos(πα)dα−π(b−a+d−c)∫01αcos(πα)dα=2π(b−a+d−c).Now, we turn to the sine entropy for functions of uncertain sets. The general result is stated as follows,Theorem 8Assume ξ1, ξ2, …, ξnare independent uncertain sets with regular membership functions μ1, μ2, …, μn, respectively. If the function f(x1, x2, …, xn) is strictly increasing with respect to x1, x2, …, xm, and strictly decreasing with respect to xm+1, …, xn. ThenS[f(ξ)]=π∫01(f(μ1r−1(α),…,μmr−1(α),μm+1,l−1(α),…,μnl−1(α))−f(μ1l−1(α),…,μml−1(α),μm+1,r−1(α),…,μnr−1(α)))cos(πα)dα.ProofBy Theorem 2, the right and left inverse membership functions of ξ areμr−1(α)=f(μ1r−1(α),…,μmr−1(α),μm+1,l−1(α),…,μnl−1(α)),μl−1(α)=f(μ1l−1(α),…,μml−1(α),μm+1,r−1(α),…,μnr−1(α))respectively. Then this theorem follows immediately from Theorem 7.□Theorem 9(Positive Linearity) Let ξ and η be independent uncertain sets with regular membership functions. Then for any real number a and b, we haveS[aξ+bη]=|a|S[ξ]+|b|S[η].ProofSuppose ξ and η have regular membership functions μ and ν, respectively. The theorem will be proved in three steps.Step 1: We prove S[aξ]=|a|S[ξ]. If a≥0, then the right and left inverse membership functions of aξ areλr−1(α)=aμr−1(α),λl−1(α)=aμl−1(α).It follows from Theorem 8 thatS[aξ]=π∫01(aμr−1(α)−aμl−1(α))cos(πα)dα=aπ∫01(μr−1(α)−μl−1(α))cos(πα)dα=|a|S[ξ].If a=0, we have S[aξ]=0=|a|S[ξ]. If a<0, then the right and left inverse membership functions of aξ areλr−1(α)=aμl−1(α),λl−1(α)=aμr−1(α).It follows from Theorem 8 thatS[aξ]=π∫01(aμl−1(α)−aμr−1(α))cos(πα)dα=(−a)π∫01(μr−1(α)−μl−1(α))cos(πα)dα=|a|S[ξ].Thus we have S[aξ]=|a|S[ξ].: We prove S[ξ+η]=S[ξ]+S[η]. Note that the right and left inverse membership functions of ξ+η areλr−1(α)=μr−1(α)+νr−1(α),λl−1(α)=μl−1(α)+νl−1(α).It follows from Theorem 8 thatS[ξ+η]=π∫01(μr−1(α)+νr−1(α)−μl−1(α)−νl−1(α))cos(πα)dα=π∫01(μr−1(α)−μl−1(α))cos(πα)dα+π∫01(νr−1(α)−νl−1(α))cos(πα)dα=S[ξ]+S[η].: For any real numbers a and b, it follows from Steps 1 and 2 thatS[aξ+bη]=S[aξ]+S[bη]=|a|S[ξ]+|b|S[η].The theorem is proved.□Relative entropy was first proposed by Kullback and Leibler [13] in 1951 to measure the divergence of two probability distributions. After that, Bhandari and Pal [2] introduced relative entropy to fuzzy sets, and employed it to measure the differences between two membership functions in 1993. Then Chen et al. [5] proposed relative entropy for uncertain variables. However, all these definitions of relative entropy are non-symmetric. In this section, we aim to present a new and symmetric relative entropy for uncertain sets.Definition 8Let ξ and η be two uncertain sets with membership functions μ and ν, respectively. Then the sine relative entropy of ξ and η is defined byR[ξ,η]=∫−∞+∞(μ(x)−ν(x))sinπμ(x)2−sinπν(x)2dx.Remark 2Note that the sine relative entropy is symmetric, i.e., R[ξ, η]=R[η, ξ] for any two uncertain sets ξ and η. It means the divergence between ξ and η is the same as the divergence between η and ξ.Example 6Let ξ1=(a1, b1) and ξ2=(a2, b2) be two rectangular uncertain sets. If a1<b1<a2<b2, thenR[ξ1,ξ2]=∫a1b1(1−0)sinπ2−sin0dx+∫a2b2(0−1)sin0−sinπ2dx=b1−a1+b2−a2.If a1<a1<b1<b2, thenR[ξ1,ξ2]=∫a1a2(1−0)sinπ2−sin0dx+∫a2b1(1−1)sinπ2−sinπ2dx+∫b1b2(0−1)sin0−sinπ2dx=b1−a1+b2−a2.Example 7Let ξ1=(a1, b1, c1) and ξ2=(a2, b2, c2) be two triangular uncertain sets. If a1<b1<c1<a2<b2<c2, thenR[ξ1,ξ2]=∫a1b1x−a1b1−a1−0sinπ2x−a1b1−a1−sin0dx+∫b1c1c1−xc1−b1−0sinπ2c1−xc1−b1−sin0dx+∫a2b2x−a2b2−a2−0sinπ2x−a2b2−a2−sin0dx+∫b2c2c2−xc2−b2−0sinπ2c2−xc2−b2−sin0dx=4π2(b1−a1)+4π2(c1−b1)+4π2(b2−a2)+4π2(c2−b2)=4π2(c1−a1+c2−a2).Theorem 10Let ξ and η be two uncertain sets. Then R[ξ, η]≥0, and equality holds if and only if ξ and η have the same membership function.ProofNote thatf(s,t)=(s−t)sinπs2−sinπt2≥0for all (s, t)∈[0, 1]×[0, 1]. Since a membership function can only take value in [0,1], the inequality follows immediately. In addition, f(s, t)=0 if and only if s=t. Thus the equality holds if and only if ξ and η have the same membership function.□In this section, we give an application of the sine relative entropy in the field of portfolio selection. For simplicity, we assume that there are only n stocks in a market whose investment returns are uncertain sets ξi, i=1, 2, …, n. In order to hedge an uncertain risk η, our object is to find a portfolioβ=(β1, β2, …, βn) such that the uncertain return β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξndiffers from η as less as possible. In other words, an investor want to minimize the sine relative entropy R[β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξn, η]. Nevertheless, as a rational individual, an investor also hope to maximize the expected utility E[U(β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξn)], where U is the utility function of the investor. Based on the assumptions, we formulate the portfolio selection problem as a bi-objective programming model(1)minβR[β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξn,η]maxβE[U(β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξn)]subject to:β1+β2+⋯+βn=1βi≥0,i=1,2,…,n.By the main-objective method, the bi-objective programming model could be transformed into(2)minβR[β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξn,η]subject to:E[U(β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξn)]≥U0β1+β2+⋯+βn=1βi≥0,i=1,2,…,nwhere U0 is a predetermined level that the expected utility is supposed to reach. Let μ1, μ2, …, μndenote the membership functions of ξ1, ξ2, …, ξn, respectively, and μ and λ denote the membership functions of β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξnand η, respectively. Then according to Theorem 2,μl−1(α)=β1μ1l−1(α)+⋯+βnμnl−1(α),μr−1(α)=β1μ1r−1(α)+⋯+βnμnr−1(α).Note that the utility function U of a rational individual is always an increasing function, we haveE[U(β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξn)]=12∫01U(μl−1(α))+U(μr−1(α))dαby Corollary 1. So the portfolio selection model (2) can be transformed into(3)minβR[β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξn,η]subject to:12∫01Uβ1μ1l−1(α)+⋯+βnμnl−1(α)+Uβ1μ1r−1(α)+⋯+βnμnr−1(α)dα≥U0β1+β2+⋯+βn=1βi≥0,i=1,2,…,n.For example, in a fictitious market there are only three stocks with rectangular uncertain return ξ1=(3, 4), triangular uncertain return ξ2=(2, 4, 5) and trapezoidal uncertain return ξ3=(1, 4, 5, 7), respectively. Then the left and right inverse membership functions of the uncertain utility U(β1ξ1+β2ξ2+⋯+βnξn) isλl−1(α)=U(β1a1+β2((1−α)a2+αb2)+β3((1−α)a3+αb3))=U(β1a1+β2a2+β3a3+β2(b2−a2)α+β3(b3−a3)α),λr−1(α)=U(β1b1+β2((1−α)c2+αb2)+β3((1−α)d3+αc3))=U(β1b1+β2c2+β3d3+β2(b2−c2)α+β3(c3−d3)α).Assume that the uncertain risk η has a membership functionλ(x)=1−(x/3−1)2. Then for a risk-aversion investor with a utility function U(x)=lnx and a minimum expected utility U0=1.3, the best portfolio selection isβ=(0, 0.0926, 0.9074). The investment return is an uncertain set (1.0926, 4, 4.9074, 6.8148), and the corresponding minimal sine relative entropy is 1.2253.In this section, we give an application of the sine relative entropy in the field of clustering. For simplification, we only consider the case of recognizing grayness of different degree. Assume there are five types of grayness, namely white, lightgray, gray, dimgray and black whose membership functions are given in Fig. 3.Now, given a type of grayness with a triangular membership function (96, 160, 192), which cluster is it supposed to belong to? Obviously, it does not belong to the “white” or “black” clusters. In order to find a proper cluster from the other clusters, we calculate their sine relative entropies. For simplicity, we denote the given type of grayness as “unknown”. By the definition of sine relative entropy, we haveR[unknown,lightgray]=∫064x64sinπ2·x64dx+∫6496128−x64sinπ2·128−x64dx+∫96128128−x64−x−9664sinπ2·128−x64−sinπ2·x−9664dx+∫128160x−9664sinπ2·x−9664dx+∫160192192−x32sinπ2·192−x32dx=896+2562π2+2π,R[unknown,gray]=∫6496x−6464sinπ2·x−6464dx+∫96128x−6464−x−9664sinπ2·x−6464−sinπ2·x−9664dx+∫128160192−x64−x−9664sinπ2·192−x64−sinπ2·x−9664dx+∫160192192−x64−192−x32sinπ2·192−x64−sinπ2·192−x32dx=1088−5122π2−64π,R[unknown,dimgray]=∫96128x−9664sinπ2·x−9664dx+∫192256256−x64sinπ2·256−x64dx+∫128160x−9664−x−12864sinπ2·x−9664−sinπ2·x−12864dx+∫160192x−12864−192−x32sinπ2·x−12864−sinπ2·192−x32dx=1216−2562π2−160−322π.Since R[unknown, gray]<R[unknown, dimgray]<R[unknown, lightgray], the given color is suggested to get categorized into the “gray” cluster.Again, given another type of grayness with a trapezoidal membership function (0, 32, 48, 64), which cluster is it supposed to belong to? Apparently, it possibly belongs to either “white” cluster or “lightgray” cluster. Denote the given trapezoidal uncertain set (0, 32, 48, 64) by “unknown”, and consider its sine relative entropy with the “white” and “lightgray” uncertain sets, respectively. By the definition of sine relative entropy, we haveR[unknown,white]=∫03264−x64−x32sinπ2·64−x64−sinπ2·x32dx+∫324864−x64−1sinπ2·64−x64−sinπ2·1dx+∫486464−x64−64−x16sinπ2·64−x64−sinπ2·64−x16dx=10−64π+1008−2562π2−1024π2cos38π,R[unknown,lightgray]=∫032x64−x32sinπ2·x64−sinπ2·x32dx+∫3248x64−1sinπ2·x64−sinπ2·1dx+∫4864x64−64−x16sinπ2·x64−sinπ2·64−x16dx+∫64128128−x64sinπ2·128−x64=6−32π+1680−2562π2−1024π2sin38π.Since R[unknown, white]<R[unknown, lightgray], the given color is suggested to get categorized into the “white” cluster.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Entropy proposes a measurement of uncertainty. In this paper, we proposed sine entropy for uncertain set. Then we derived a formula to calculate the sine entropy via inverse membership function. Besides, we investigated its main properties such as translation invariance and positive linearity. In addition, we studied the sine relative entropy for uncertain sets, and gave its applications in portfolio selection and clustering.
