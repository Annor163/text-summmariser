@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Rational Bézier curves provide a curve fitting tool and are widely used in Computer Aided Geometric Design, Computer Aided Design and Geometric Modeling. The injectivity (one-to-one property) of rational Bézier curve as a mapping function is equivalent to the curve without self-intersections. We present a geometric condition on the control polygon which is equivalent to the injectivity of rational Bézier curve with this control polygon for all possible choices of weights. The proof is based on the degree elevation and toric degeneration of rational Bézier curve.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The rational Bézier curves/patches are widely used in Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD), Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Geometric Modeling as the curve/surface fitting tool because of their precisely representation of the conics and preservation of good properties. The shape of rational Bézier curve can be adjusted by its control polygon and weights. The basic properties and algorithms for the rational Bézier curve are illustrated in Farin’s book [1] and paper [2].As is well-known, the self-intersection of rational Bézier curve leads to bad influence in the offsets design of the curve [3,4]. In [5], Hoffmann mentioned that the intersection problem has become a fundamental problem in solid modeling systems and the integration of geometric objects. As a mapping function, the injectivity (one-to-one property) of rational Bézier curve is equivalent to the curve without self-intersections.In 1989, Lasser [3] proposed a curve-curve algorithm to calculate the self-intersection of Bézier curve by subdividing the control polygon of the curve using the de Casteljau algorithm. This method needs to check the possibility of the curve with the self-intersection by the sum of the rotation angles of control polygon before the algorithm begins. Tiller and Hanson [4] presented an algorithm to calculate the self-intersections of B-spline curve. Unfortunately, their methods may fail to the Bézier curve because the Bézier curve may have no self-intersection though the sum of the rotation angles is bigger thanπ. On the other hand, the Bézier curve may have self-intersections though its control polygon without self-intersections actually. For the 2D and 3D surface patches, many papers studied on the conditions which imply the injectivity of the patches. In 1996, Goodman and Unsworth [6] proposed a sufficient condition for the injectivity of a 2D Bézier function. For the control points of am×ntensor product patch, their condition involves2m(m+1)+2n(n+1)linear inequalities. For image morphing, Choi and Lee [7] presented a sufficient condition for the injectivity of 2D and 3D uniform cubic B-spline functions. Their condition provides a single bound for the displacements of control points that guarantees the injectivity of the cubic B-spline function.Fig. 1shows three rational planar cubic Bézier curves with their control polygons. According to the Lasser’s method [3], the curve in Fig. 1(a) may have self-intersections. On the contrary, we claim that the curve has no self-intersection with any positive weights in accordance with Theorem 3. The curve in Fig. 1(b) has one point of self-intersection, which may be removed by varying the weights as shown in Fig. 1(c). Geometrically, there is no self-intersection of the control polygon of the first curve while the others have. And we can learn from the variation diminishing property of rational Bézier curve that the shape of control polygon implies the shape of curve. This brings us a question: Does no self-intersection of control polygon of rational Bézier curve imply no self-intersection of the curve? The answer is NO. For example, the curve in Fig. 10(b) has one point of self-intersection while there is no self-intersection of its control polygon. We will explain the reason in this paper.In 2008, Craciun et al. [8] gave a geometric condition on the control points which implies that the resulting toric Bézier patch has no self-intersection with any choice of positive weights. Unfortunately, there is a minor flaw in the result cause it only guarantees the injectivity in the interior of the patch. Sottile and Zhu corrected that flaw for 2D patches in [9]. Recently, Zhu et al. [10] presented a geometric condition on control polygons to study the injectivity of planar rational Bézier curve.The cited works provided conditions which imply no self-intersection. Our purpose of this paper is different and proves the stronger result. We give a geometric condition on control polygons which implies the injectivity of the spatial rational Bézier curve for arbitrary positive weights.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall the definition of rational Bézier curve and geometric property of its toric degeneration. In Section 3, we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the injectivity of rational Bézier curve for arbitrary positive weights, and some representative examples are illustrated.In this section, we recall the classical definition of rational Bézier curve and its equivalent definition derived from Krasauskas’ toric surface patches [11]. To define geometric condition on the control polygon properly, we also recall the basic theory of the toric degeneration of rational Bézier curve (geometric meaning of control curves) presented by García-Puente et al. [12].There is a fair amount of literature studied on rational Bézier curves. We just cite a few: Farin [1] and Davis [13]. They presented the properties and basic theory of rational Bézier curves. The following definition and degree elevation property, we refer to those books.Definition 1For given pointsbi∈R3,i=0,…,n, the parametric curve(2.1)R(u)=∑i=0nωibiBin(u)∑i=0nωiBin(u),u∈[0,1],is called a rational Bézier curve of degree n, whereBin(u)=niui(1-u)n-iare the Bernstein basis of degreen,biare called control points andωiare the weights. The control polygon of the curve is the union of segmentsb0b1‾,…,bn-1bn‾between consecutive control points.By the degree elevation property of the Bernstein basis, the degree elevation property of rational Bézier curve can be derived directly. The rational Bézier curveR(u)(2.1) of degree n can be represented as a curve of degreen+1(2.2)R(u)=∑i=0n+1ωi∗bi∗Bin+1(u)∑i=0n+1ωi∗Bin+1(u),u∈[0,1],whereωi∗=in+1ωi-1+1-in+1ωi,bi∗=in+1ωi-1bi-1+1-in+1ωibiωi∗,i=0,…,n+1,ω-1=ωn+1=0,b-1=bn+1=0.LetPrbe the control polygon of curveR(u)rasing degree r times. Then the control polygons converge to the curveR(u)whiler→∞asTheorem 1(2.3)limr→∞Pr=R(u).In 2002, Krasauskas [11] presented a new method to construct the multi-sided surface patches, named toric patches. The mathematical theory of toric patches is based on toric variety from Algebraic Geometry and toric ideals from Combinatorics. The classical tensor-product and triangular Bézier patches are the special cases of toric patches. If the parametric domain is one-dimensional, then the toric patch degenerates to the rational Bézier curve.SupposeA={a0,a1,…,an}=Δ∩Zis a set of finite integers, wherea0<a1<⋯<an, and the intervalΔ=[a0,an]. Letβai,A(x)=caih1(x)h1(ai)h2(x)h2(ai),ai∈A,wherecaiare positive real numbers andh1(x)=x-a0,h2(x)=an-x. The functionsβai,A(x)are called toric Bézier basis. It is easy to check that those functions are non-negative and have no common zeros onΔ. LetR>be the collection of the positive real numbers. Following the Krasauskas’ toric patches [11], the toric Bézier curve can be defined as follows.Definition 2Given a set of finite integersA⊂Z, control pointsB={bai|ai∈A}⊂R3and the weightsω={ωai|ai∈A}⊂R>, the parametric curve(2.4)FA,ω,B(x)=∑i=1nωaibaiβai,A(x)∑i=1nωaiβai,A(x),x∈Δis called a toric Bézier curve and the union of segmentsba0ba1‾,…,ban-1ban‾is called the control polygon of the curve.If we setΔ=[0,n], thenA={0,1,…,n}andh1(x)=x,h2(x)=n-x. For anyi∈A, the toric Bézier basis isβi,A≔cixi(n-x)n-i.If we letx=nuandci=nin-n, thenβi,A(x)is the classical Bernstein basisBin(u)and the parametric domain is changed to[0,1].By Remark 1, a toric Bézier curve can be reparametrized as a rational Bézier curve. This means the definition of toric Bézier curve is equivalent to the definition of rational Bézier curve. For convenience of analysis, we will use curves defined in (2.4) to represent rational Bézier curve in this paper. For higher dimensions, the toric Bézier basis and toric patches can be defined in the same way.We use a lifting functionλ:A↦Rto lift the points ofAintoR2. LetPλbe the convex hull of the lifted points,Pλ=conv{(ai,λ(ai))|ai∈A}⊂R2.The upper edges ofPλare those whose outward pointing normals have positive last coordinates. The union of the upper edges is the upper hull ofPλ. If we project this upper hull back toR, it coversΔand induces a regular domain decompositionTλofΔ. The decomposition ofAis called regular decompositionSλofAif each subset ofSλconsists of the points ofAwhose lifts lie on a common face in the upper hull of a lifted polygonPλ.Example 1LetA={0,1,2,3}andΔ=[0,3]. Suppose the lifting functionλ1has the assignments{1,2,3,1}at the points{0,1,2,3}, then the regular domain decomposition ofΔisTλ1={[0,2],[2,3]}and the regular decomposition ofAisSλ1={0,1,2},{2,3}(see Fig. 2(a)). If the lifting functionλ2, it has the assignments{1,1,3,1}at the points{0,1,2,3}, then the regular domain decomposition ofΔisTλ2={[0,2],[2,3]}and the regular decomposition isSλ2={0,2},{2,3}(see Fig. 2(b)). These two lifting functions induce the same regular domain decomposition ofΔbut different regular decompositions ofAsince the lifted point(1,λ2(1))does not lie on the upper hull ofPλ2.Suppose that we have a regular decompositionSλofAinduced by a lifting functionλ. We can use the weightsω|F={ωai|ai∈F}and control pointsB|F={bai|ai∈F}indexed by elements of a subsectFofSλas weights and control points for constructing a rational Bézier curve by Definition 2, denote byFF,ω|F,B|F, which parametric domain is the corresponding subset of regular domain decompositionTλofΔ. The union of those toric Bézier curvesFA,ω,B(Sλ)≔⋃F∈SλFF,ω|F,B|F,is called the regular control curve of the rational Bézier curveFA,ω,B(x)induced by the regular decompositionSλ. The regular control curve induced by a regular decomposition is naturally aC0spline curve. Example 2 can better explain the meaning of the construction of regular control curves.Example 2LetA={0,1,2,3},Δ=[0,3], and the weightsω={1,4,4,1}. Two cubic rational Bézier curves and their control points{b0,b1,b2,b3}are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Using the lifting functionλ1in Example 1, we get the regular domain decompositionTλ1={[0,2],[2,3]}ofΔand the regular decompositionSλ1={0,1,2},{2,3}ofA. For the subset{0,1,2}, we can construct a rational quadric Bézier curve by the control points{b0,b1,b2}and weights{1,4,4}, and a linear Bézier curve by the control points{b2,b3}and weights{4,1}. Then the regular control curve is the union of those two curves. Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows the regular control curves of the cubic Bézier curves in Fig. 1(a) and (b) respectively.For the given weightsω={ωai∈R>|ai∈A}, we get a family of weights which depend upon the lifting functionλand a parameter t,ωλ(t)≔tλ(ai)ωai|ai∈A.We use these weights to define a rational Bézier curve with parameter t,FA,ωλ(t),B(x;t)=∑i=0ntλ(a)ωaibaiβai,A(x)∑i=0ntλ(a)ωaiβai,A(x),x∈Δ.García-Puente et al. [12] proved that the regular control curve induced by the lifting functionλis exactly the possible limit of rational Bézier curveFA,ωλ(t),B(x;t)when the control pointsBare fixed but the parametert→+∞. This property is called the toric degeneration of Bézier curve.Theorem 2[12]limt→+∞FA,ωλ(t),B(x;t)=FA,ω,B(Sλ).The rational cubic Bézier curve with the weightsω={1,4,4,1}and control polygon show in Fig. 1. The regular decompositionSλ={0,1,2},{2,3}ofA=0,1,2,3is induced by the lifting functionλ1defined in Example 1. We can define the rational cubic Bézier curveFA,ωλ(t),B(x;t)with parameter t by a family of weightsωλ(t)=t,4t2,4t3,t. By Theorem 2, the limit ofωλ(t)=t,4t2,4t3,tis the regular control curve shown in Fig. 3 whilet→+∞. Fig. 4shows the curves witht=1,t=5,t=10respectively.In [10], a geometric condition on the control polygon to study the injectivity of planar rational Bézier curve is presented. In this paper, we prove a stronger result. We give a geometric condition on the control polygon whose definition is equivalent to the injectivity of every rational Bézier curve with this control polygon for all possible choices of positive weights.For a rational Bézier curveFA,ω,B(x)defined byA={a0,…,an}⊂Z, the weightsω, and the control pointsB={bai|ai∈A}⊂R3, let the subsetA∼⊂Asatisfyinga0,an∈A∼. This means thatA∼is obtained by dropping some points fromAbut remaining the pointsa0,aninA∼. Let the points setB∼={bai|ai∈A∼}. LetPbe the control polygon ofFA,ω,B(x)and the polygonP∼be the union of the line segments connected by the points inB∼consecutively. We define the well-posedness of the control polygon of a rational Bézier curve.Definition 3The control polygonPof a rational Bézier curve is called non-well-posed if it satisfies one of the following conditions:(a)Phas self-intersections or there existsP∼such thatP∼has self-intersections;there existsP∼such that the intersection of some line segmentL=b‾aibajofP∼and the interior of some triangle or tetrahedron inconv{bak∈B∼|ak<ai}(orconv{bak∈B∼|ak>aj}) is not empty.Otherwise, The control polygonPis called well-posed.The control polygons in Fig. 5(a) and (b) are well-posed, while the others in Fig. 5 are non-well-posed. The polygon connected by the line segmentsb0b2‾,b2b3‾,b3b4‾in Fig. 5(c) has a self-intersection, and the control polygon in Fig. 5(c) has a self-intersection as well. In Fig. 5(d), the line segmentb3b4‾goes through the tetrahedron formed by{b0,b1,b2,b3}and the line segmentb3b4‾lies in the tetrahedron formed by{b0,b1,b2,b3}as Fig. 5(e) shown.There exists a choice of the weights of a rational Bézier curve of degree n(n=2,3), such that the curve goes through any point inside the triangle(n=2)or tetrahedron(n=3)formed by its control points.The proof of Lemma 1 is trivial. We can set the weights for the first and the last control points to be 1, then solve the equation to get the other weights, which satisfies the curve going through the point inside the triangle(n=2)or tetrahedron(n=3)formed by its control points.Theorem 3Given a set of finite integersA⊂Zand control pointsB={bai|ai∈A}⊂R3, for any choice of the weightsω={ωai|ai∈A}⊂R>, there is no self-intersection of rational Bézier curveFA,ω,B(x)if and only if the control polygon of the curve is well-posed.We prove the necessity by contradiction. Suppose the control polygonPofFA,ω,B(x)is non-well-posed.IfPsatisfies the condition(a)in Definition 3, thenPhas self-intersections or there existsP∼such thatP∼has self-intersections. Note thatPhaving self-intersections is the special case of the later one (that isP=P∼). We assume thatA∼={ak1,ak2,…,aks}⊂A,B∼={bai|ai∈A∼}and the polygonP∼is the union of the line segments connected by the points inB∼consecutively such thatP∼has self-intersections, wherek1=0,ks=n. Then there exists a lifting functionλ:A↦Rsuch thatλinduces a regular decomposition ofA(3.1)Sλ≔{{ak1,ak2},{ak2,ak3},…,{aks-1,aks}}.It is easy to check that the regular control curveFA,ω,B(Sλ)induced bySλisP∼. For example, for the control polygon of a quartic rational Bézier curve as shown in Fig. 5(c), we can setA∼={0,2,3,4}, regular decomposition ofAisSλ={{0,2},{2,3},{3,4}}and regular control curveP∼is the union of the line segments connected by the points inB∼={b0,b2,b3,b4}. By Theorem 2, we havelimt→+∞FA,ωλ(t),B(x;t)=FA,ω,B(Sλ)=P∼.From the assumption, there is a self-intersection ofP∼. This implies that there existst∗∈R>, such that the rational Bézier curveFA,ωλ(t∗),B(x;t∗)has a self-intersection and this leads to a contradiction.IfPsatisfies the condition (b) in Definition 3, without losses of generality, we assume the intersection of line segmentL=bakjbakj+1‾ofP∼and the interior of the tetrahedronconv{baki,baki+1,baki+2,baki+3}is nonempty, wherekj>ki+3. Then there exists a lifting function such that it induces a regular decomposition ofA(3.2)Sλ≔{{ak1,ak2},…,{aki,aki+1,aki+2,aki+3},…,{akj,akj+1},…,{aks-1,aks}}.Therefore, the regular control curveFA,ω,B(Sλ)induced bySλis the union of some line segments and a cubic rational Bézier curveFiindexed by{aki,aki+1,aki+2,aki+3}and the control points{baki,baki+1,baki+2,baki+3}. Let the pointQlies on the intersection ofL=bakj,bakj+1‾and the interior of tetrahedronconv{baki,baki+1,baki+2,baki+3}. By Lemma 1, we choose the weights for{aki,aki+1,aki+2,aki+3}properly such that theFigoes through the pointQ. We replace the initial weights for{aki,aki+1,aki+2,aki+3}by those weights, then the new regular control curveFA,ω,B(Sλ)has a self-intersection. This implies that there existst∗∈R>, such that the rational Bézier curveFA,ωλ(t∗),B(x;t∗)has a self-intersection and this leads to a contradiction. If the intersection of line segmentLofP∼lies in a triangleconv{baki,baki+1,baki+2}, the result can be proved in the same way and we will omit the details here.The proof for the sufficiency is simple. Suppose the control polygon of a rational Bézier curve is well-posed. From [14], the degree elevation of rational Bézier curve cannot increase the number of self-intersections of control polygon. Note that the condition (b) in Definition 3 is equivalent to the condition that there existsP∼such that the intersection of some line segmentL=bakibaki+1‾ofP∼with the interior ofconv{bak1,…,baki-1}orconv{baki+1,…,baks}is not empty. Since the degree elevation of the control polygon is the corner-cutting procedure, each line segmentL(1)=baki(1)baki+1(1)‾of the new control polygonP(1)obtained by the degree elevation intersects the interior ofconv{bakj(1)|akj(1)⩽aki(1)}orconv{bakj(1)|akj(1)⩾aki(1)}of this control polygon is empty. This means the control polygon preserves the well-posedness after the degree elevation. Fig. 6shows the degree elevation procedure for some rational Bézier curves. From Theorem 1, the limit of sequence of the control polygons generated by the degree elevation is the rational Bézier curve. This means the curve has no self-intersection and completes the proof.Theorem 3 gives a geometric condition for checking the injectivity of rational Bézier curve for arbitrary positive weights. Actually, it is not easy to check the well-posedness of the control polygon by computer using Definition 3 if n is large. As is well known, the barycentric coordinate method is used to construct the Bézier simplices (refer to [1,15,16]). For a pointPand a simplexS⊂Rn, thenRnis divided into2n+3parts by the hyperplanes of facets of S, and we can determine which part the pointPlies in by the signs of barycentric coordinate ofPin S. ForA={a0,a1,…,an}and the control pointsB={bai|ai∈A,i=0,1,…,n}, by the barycentric coordinate method (area and volume coordinates for 2D and 3D simplices respectively), the idea for the algorithm to check the well-posedness of the control polygon is listed below.(1) Selecting 4 different control pointsbai,baj,bak,balfromB, whereai<aj<ak<al.(2) If the polygon consisted ofbai‾baj,baj‾bak,b‾akbalhas intersections, then the control polygon is non-well-posed, else continue.(3) Calculating the barycentric coordinates of any control pointbasin theconvbai,baj,bak,bal, whereas>al. Then we can determine whether some part of line segmentb‾albaslies in the interior ofconvbai,baj,bak,balor not by the signs of those barycentric coordinates. If line segmentb‾albaslies in the interior ofconvbai,baj,bak,balfor someas>al, then the control polygon is non-well-posed and terminates the algorithm.(4) Otherwise, selecting another 4 different control pointsbai,baj,bak,balfromB, whereai<aj<ak<al, go to step 2).Note that in step (2), if the pointsbai,baj,bak,balfromBlie on the same plane, the algorithm is also effective. We can determine whether the pointbaslies in one of the triangles formed by any 3 points of{bai,baj,bak,bal}by the signs of its barycentric coordinates. It is easy to check that this algorithm is equivalent to Definition 3 and much easier to implement. We will find the robust and effective algorithm in the future since the complexity of the algorithm isO(n5). Actually, although the complexity of the algorithm is high when n is large, the algorithm will terminate quickly if the control polygon is non-well-posed (see Fig. 7).Example 5Table 1shows the computation time for checking the well-posedness of the control polygons with n control points, where the control points are generated randomly andn=10,102,103,104,105. In this example, we use the MATLAB R2013b, and computer with Intel Core 2 Duo 2.53GHz processor and 4.00GB RAM.By Theorem 3, we can get the following result directly.Corollary 1For the set of finite integersA⊂Zand control pointsB={bai|ai∈A}, if the control polygon is non-well-posed, then there exists a choice of weightsω∗={ωai∗|ai∈A}⊂R>such that the rational Bézier curveFA,ω∗,B(x)=∑i=0nωai∗baiβai,A(x)∑i=0nωai∗βai,A(x),x∈Δhas self-intersections.LetA={0,1,2,3,4}, the weightsω={1,4,4,4,1}and the control pointsB={b0,b1,b2,b3,b4}. The control polygon has a self-intersection (see Fig. 8(a)). Suppose the lifting functionλhas the assignments{0,1,1.5,1,0}at the points{0,1,2,3,4}, then the regular decomposition ofAisSλ={{0,1}{1,2},{2,3},{3,4}}and the regular control curveFA,ω,B(Sλ)is the control polygon itself. The rational Bézier curveFA,ωλ(t∗),B(x;t∗)has a self-intersection fort∗=1, as shown in Fig. 8(b).SupposeA={0,1,2,3,4}, the weightsω={1,c,d,4,1}and the control pointsB={b0,b1,b2,b3,b4}. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the control polygon is non-well-posed. Suppose the lifting functionλhas the assignments{2,2,2,2,1}at the points{0,1,2,3,4}, then the regular decomposition ofAisSλ={{0,1,2,3},{3,4}}and the regular control curveFA,ω,B(Sλ)is the union of a cubic rational Bézier curveR1(determined by control pointsb0,b1,b2,b3and their weights) and the line segmentb3b4‾. Since the line segmentb3b4‾goes through the tetrahedronconvb0,b1,b2,b3, by Lemma 1, we can choose the weightsc,dproperly (we chosec=4,d=4here) such that the cubic rational Bézier curveR1intersectsb3b4‾(see Fig. 9(b)). This means the regular control curve has a self-intersection. Then there existst∗∈R>such that rational Bézier curveFA,ωλ(t∗),B(x;t∗)has a self-intersection. Fig. 9(b) shows the curve with a self-intersection witht∗=10.SupposeA={0,1,2,3,4}, the weightsω={1,c,d,4,1}and the control pointsB={b0,b1,b2,b3,b4}. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the control polygon is non-well-posed. Suppose the lifting functionλis the same as in Example 7 and use the same method in Example 7, we can get a rational Bézier curveFA,ωλ(t∗),B(x;t∗)has a self-intersection (see Fig. 10(b)) withc=4,d=4,t∗=1.In 1989, Lasser [3] claimed that if the sum of the rotation angles of the control polygon∑|αk|>π, then the Bézier curve may have self-intersections. By this claim, there may exist self-intersections for the Bézier curve defined by the control polygon as Fig. 11(a) shown. However, by Theorem 3, we can declare that the rational Bézier curve with this control polygon has no self-intersection for arbitrary positive weights because it is well-posed (see Fig. 11(a) for instance).Corollary 1 gives the existence of the weights such that the rational Bézier curve has self-intersections if the control polygon is non-well-posed. For practical application, it is important to solve the calculation of the weights such that the curve defined by a non-well-posed control polygon has self-intersections is a very important problem. And a key step is to determine the distance between the curve and its control polygon. Nairn et al. [17] and Karavelas et al. [18] provided a method to estimate the distance between the polynomial Bézier curve and its control polygon. They firstly parameterize the control polygon, and then estimate the distance between the curve and the control polygon by the parametrization of the curve and the second-order difference of the control polygon. However, the parametrization of rational Bézier curve varies during the toric degeneration of the curve, then the method proposed in [17,18] is not suitable for solving this problem. Note that if the control polygon is non-well-posed, there are too many choices of weights such that rational Bézier curve has self-intersections. Therefore, for the given curve (given control polygon and weights), how to check whether rational Bézier curve has self-intersections or not is another complicated problem. The knowledge from Geometric Combinatorics may be found useful in the process of checking, such as the results of regular triangulation in [19] for instance.From the proof of the Theorem 3, a simple method to calculate the weights is provided. For the non-well-posed control polygonP,(1) ifPsatisfies the condition(a)in Definition 3, then we can get a regular decompositionSλofAas (3.1) shown, and the regular control curveFA,ω,B(Sλ)is the union of line segments with self-intersections (such as Example 6);(2) ifPsatisfies the condition(b)in Definition 3, we can get a regular decompositionSλofAas (3.2) shown, and the regular control curveFA,ω,B(Sλ)has self-intersection (such as Examples 7 and 8).By Theorems 2 and 3, there existst∗∈R>such that the rational Bézier curvesFA,ωλ(t),B(x;t)has a self-intersection whilet>t∗. Generally, we can get the curveFA,ωλ(t∗),B(x;t∗)with self-intersections for a relatively large positivet∗since the curve converges to its regular control curve exponentially. For instance, the curve has a self-intersection fort∗=10in Example 7 and the curve has a self-intersection fort∗=1in Example 8. However, how to give the lower bound oft∗is still unknown.
