@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An object tracking sensor network (OTSN) is a wireless sensor network designed to track moving objects in its sensing area. It is made of static sensors deployed in a region for tracking moving targets. Usually, these sensors are equipped of a sensing unit and a non-rechargeable battery. The investigated mission involves a moving target with a known trajectory, such as a train on a railway or a plane in an airline route. In order to save energy, the target must be monitored by exactly one sensor at any time. In our context, the sensors may be not accessible during the mission and the target can be subject to earliness or tardiness. Therefore, our aim is to build a static schedule of sensing activities that resists to these perturbations. A pseudo-polynomial two-step algorithm is proposed. First, a discretization step processes the input data, and a mathematical formulation of the scheduling problem is proposed. Then, a dichotomy approach that solves a transportation problem at every iteration is introduced; the very last step is addressed by solving a linear program.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since wireless sensors are becoming more and more affordable, more and more applications are now possible such as traffic control or battlefield surveillance (Akyildiz, Su, Sankarasubramaniam, & Cayirci, 2002; Yick, Mukherjee, & Ghosal, 2008). Low-cost sensors are usually autonomous, equipped with a sensing unit and a battery. Their typical purpose is to track targets in their sensing range. They can be randomly deployed from an airplane or an helicopter in places lacking monitoring infrastructures. Sensors relying on technologies like drones and radars are suitable in military or humanitarian assistance contexts, where the infrastructures are destroyed or non-existent. In this paper, the investigated mission is to monitor a target with a known trajectory, such as a train on a railway, a vehicle on a road or a plane in an airline route. Since accessing sensors can be difficult in some environments, we may have no control on them during the mission. Then, in order to save battery lifetime, sensors can be switched off and waken up later. To minimize the energy consumption, the target is monitored by only one sensor at a time. Moreover, the target is subject to perturbations on its path, that may cause advances and delays. Consequently, our challenge is to find a static schedule of sensing activities, able to monitor the target at any time, without target loss despite perturbation. A target loss happens when the target is outside the range of any active sensor. A sensing activity is identified by a sensor, a starting date and a duration, to be computed offline, before the mission. During an activity, the corresponding sensor wakes up, collects information about the target for a certain amount of time, and then gets back to sleep status. Our aim is to find the most robust schedule, i.e. the one that resists to the largest possible earliness and tardiness.
