Evaluation of monoscopic and stereoscopic displays for visual–spatial tasks in medical contexts

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Controlled visual experiments were used to examine performance on 3D spatial tasks.We examine the effects of stereopsis in medical spatial tasks.Stereopsis significantly effects spatial task performance in specific ranges.Color did not affect the performance of participants.Orientation of the 3D representation influenced the effect of steropsis.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the medical field, digital images are present in diagnosis, pre-operative planning, minimally invasive surgery, instruction, and training. The use of medical digital imaging has afforded new ways to interact with a patient, such as seeing fine details inside a body. This increased usage also raises many basic research questions on human perception and performance when utilizing these images. The work presented here attempts to answer the question: How would adding the stereopsis depth cue affect relative position tasks in a medical context compared to a monoscopic view? By designing and conducting a study to isolate the benefits between monoscopic 3D and stereoscopic 3D displays in a relative position task, the following hypothesis was tested: stereoscopic 3D displays are beneficial over monoscopic 3D displays for relative position judgment tasks in a medical visualization setting. 44 medical students completed a series of relative position judgments tasks. The results show that stereoscopic condition yielded a higher score than the monoscopic condition with regard to the hypothesis.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Visualizing and understanding digital medical data is a complex yet critical process involved in diagnosis, pre-operative planning, minimally invasive surgery, instruction and training in the medical field. The information generated from CT, MRI, and other medical imaging technologies can be high in volume, highly detailed and complex. Translating this data into usable information is difficult, yet of the uttermost importance to patients’ care [1]. At 28.6%, diagnostic errors are the leading type of medical paid claim in the United States. Diagnostic errors leading to death or permanent injury range from 80,000 to 160,000 patients annually [2]. Diagnostic errors occur because: (1) physician cognitive bias, for example when a physician focuses in a single diagnosis without considering all the diagnostic possibilities and (2) Limited information, medical imaging data is not always available in diagnosis [3]. It is crucial that medical imaging data is represented and used in such a way as to minimize diagnostic errors.Visualization tools and applications are being developed to minimize the complexity of medical data. One of the proposed solutions is the use of both monocular and binocular cues for depth perception, as in the case of stereoscopic applications. Depth perception is used to determine the shapes of objects in the world, and the spatial position of these objects [4]. The ability to see depth is so important that the Human Visual System (HVS) has redundant cues to detect it. Monocular depth cues can be acquired by only one eye, and these types of cues can be present in conventional displays. Monocular depth cues include perspective projection, occlusion, familiar size, object motion, and motion parallax [5–7]. If monocular depth cues are degraded or absent in traditional displays then depth perception and performance may also degrade. Stereoscopic technology can provide more robust, natural, and accurate depth perception cues in image representations.Stereopsis is a binocular depth cue that consists of processing the disparity between the unique images presented to each eye. Human eyes are separated slightly horizontally and receive a unique perspective of the world. The brain fuses the left and right images, and from the differences between the two images, the brain extracts depth information [5]. The disparity of information obtained from the two unique images is processed to the point that the HVS can differentiate between an object 1.0m away and a second object 1.2mm away [6].Even if stereoscopic applications use the most sensitive depth cue, and theoretically offer advantages over monoscopic monitors when displaying depth information to the HVS, the adoption of stereoscopic applications in medicine will not occur until a clear advantage of stereoscopic applications over monoscopic applications is demonstrated.The work presented here attempts to study the how the stereoscopic depth cue affect a visual spatial task over a traditional monoscopic 3D display.
