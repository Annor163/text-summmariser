@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Most mobile communication companies in China were puzzled by the arrearage problem. Then credit evaluation for the mobile telephone customer becomes increasingly important in China's telecommunications services industry on economic operation and information management. The study presents a customer credit measure method based on customer attributes by employing the eigenface technology. Analysis of customer credit evaluation indicates potentiality of the proposed eigenface-based credit evaluation method that it provides a potential viable solution to the arrearage problem. By means of principal component analysis, customers represented by their attribute vectors in training set are used to build the eigenspace. Subspace of the eigenspace for credit evaluation is generated by selecting principal orthogonal eigenvectors of covariance matrix of the training samples. Each one of the principal eigenvectors ever called “eigenfaces” is taken as one basis reference customer (component) for credit evaluation. Then each customer represented its feature vector is projected onto the subspace and described by a linear combination of the basis reference customers represented by the selected principal eigenvectors in the subspace. Weights of the linear combination are denoted as one weight vector. Difference between the weight vectors is used to evaluate customer credit. The proposed method yields satisfying results in its application to credit evaluation for 400,000 customers in a mobile communication services company in China. Result analysis indicates that further arrearage management based on credit evaluation is workable.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The arrearage problem puzzled most mobile communication companies in China. In the year of 2001, it was reported [1] that a sum of ¥200,000,000(about $25,000,000) fell into arrears in China's telecommunications services industry. In 2005, arrearage rate still remained high often exceeding 10.0% [2] in China's mobile communications services industry. It was indicated that a conservative estimate for the loss of China's mobile communications services industry due to the arrearage problem might be more than 5.0% of its annual total income [1], even more than 10.0% of that in Sichuan and Chongqian, China [3]. As there had been a large increase in the number of the mobile customers, the arrearage problem worsened.To the arrearage problem, some countermeasures [4] have currently taken in China's mobile communications services industry. These include: (a) simply setting a margin for stopping service, that is, when one customer's bill exceeds a margin set by the service provider, the customer should be stopped providing services. Arrears can be kept within limits in this way, however, it make customers inconvenience and cause them discontent even churning and contracting out; (b) taking legal actions against arrearage customers or (c) creating bill hastening departments; (d) pushing prepaid service, which inversely affected the service provider's reported profits and business development.Due to the arrearage problem, the service providers have come to realize that customer credit analysis [5] is increasingly necessary. Many methodologies and techniques [6–13] have been proposed for credit evaluation with many degrees of success. Literatures of [14,15] presented a general review of the presented methodologies and techniques employed for credit evaluation. To select an appropriate model or algorithm is a consideration depending on problem and situation. It seems obviously that currently there does not exist one model or algorithm that can meet all requirements given all specific problems. Just as the authors of [15] have found that complex algorithms and models like ANN (artificial neural networks) and SVM (support vector machine) have the capability to yield a good performance, while simple classifiers like the logistic regression and LDA (linear discriminant analysis) can also perform very well in credit evaluation.The eigenface technique known for creating eigenfaces, which are eigenvectors with face-like appearance for recognition, can also be expanded to outside of facial recognitionare. This study addresses the arrearage problem by employing the eigenface-based method to evaluate credit for the mobile telephone customer. Principal orthogonal eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of given training samples are used to generate a subspace of eigenspace for credit evaluation. Each such one eigenvector in the subspace ever called “eigenfaces” is now taken as one basis reference customer (component) for credit evaluation. Then each customer is projected onto the subspace and described by a linear combination of the called basis reference customers represented by selected principal eigenvectors in the subspace. Weights of the linear combination are also denoted as one weight vector. Then difference between the weight vectors is employed to evaluate customer credit.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature survey on credit scoring and the eigenface technology. In Section 3, an eigenface-based credit evaluation method for the mobile telephone customer is proposed. Section 4 presents experimental results of credit ovulation for 400,000 mobile telephone customers in a mobile telephone service company in China as well as result analysis and discussion. Finally, conclusion and future work are presented in Section 5.In this section, credit scoring and the eigenface technology is reviewed.A wide range of techniques [6–15] have been presented for credit evaluation with many degrees of success. Artificial neural networks (ANN)-based models were presented in [6–8]. The logistic regression model was presented in [9]. The support vector machines (SVM)-based model were presented in [10]. A data driven ensemble classifier-based model was presented in [11]. A Bayesian tree-based model was presented in [12]. An artificial immune algorithm (AIA)-based credit measure model was presented in [13]. Three different mechanisms-based models (the Cox's regression model, generalized linear models and nonparametric kernel models) were examined in the empirical study [14]. Various state-of-the-art classification algorithms were reviewed in [15]. It has found that [15] complex algorithms and models like ANN and SVM have the capability to yield a good performance, while simple classifiers like the logistic regression and LDA (linear discriminant analysis) can also perform very well in credit scoring.The eigenface technique known for creating eigenfaces based on PCA (principal component analysis), is one of being well studied in the literature of face recognition [16–29]. The technology pioneered by Kirby and Sirivich in mid-1980s [18–20] was considered somewhat of a milestone [16]. In 1991, Turk and Pentland [19,20] presented the eigenface technique which enables reliable real-time automated face recognition systems. The so-called “eigenfaces” are a set of eigenvectors used for the problem of human face recognition. The eigenvectors are components of human faces. They are derived from covariance matrix of probability distribution of high dimensional vector space of possible faces with the use of PCA. The eigenface technique can reduce data dimension by means of data compression basics and discovery the most effective structure of facial patterns in low dimensions. This technique used in creating eigenfaces and using them for recognition still arouses interests of researchers and has also used outside of face recognition [20–32]. Table 1summarizes the previous works [20–32] on the eigenface technique.In this study, addressing the arrearage problem in China's telecommunications services industry, an eigenface-based method is proposed to evaluate credit for the mobile telephone customer.The Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT) or PCA, is one of the most popular methods for feature generation and dimensionality reduction in pattern recognition [30]. It is an orthogonal linear transformation which transforms the data to a new coordinate system [30–32]. Suppose we have a set of l (l>1) vectors:XN×l=(x1,x2, …,xl) and their mean vector:Ψas follows,(1)X=XN×l=(x1,x2,…,xl)andΨ=1l∑i=1lxiwhereΨ1×N=(ψ1, ψ2, …, ψN)Tis the average vector ofX.ComputeYby the linear transformation using an orthogonal basis:A(A−1=AT),(2)YN×l=AT(X−Ψ)(YN×l=(y1,y2,…,yl))where,yiandyjare columns (column vectors) ofY.From definitions of the correlation matrix and the covariance matrix, we have(3)RY=E[YYT]=E[AT(X−Ψ)(X−Ψ)TA]=ATCXAIfAis chosen so that its columns (vectors)aiare the orthogonal eigenvectors ofCXthatA=(a1,a2, …,aN), it follows,(4)Ry=E[YYT]=ATCXA=ΛwhereΛis diagonal with elements which are the respective eigenvalues λiofCX.Due to the orthogonality ofA, we have,(5)Y=AT(X−Ψ)→X=(AT)−1Y+Ψ=AY+ΨThat is,(6)X=(x1,x2,…,xl)=AY+Ψ→xj=∑i=1Naiyij+Ψ(j=1,…,l)where yijare matrix elements ofYlocated in No.i row and No.j column.When we choose the principal m eigenvectorsai(i=1, 2, …, m) ofCXto reconstruct or approximateXwhich now is defined byXˆ,(7)Xˆ=(xˆ1,xˆ2,…,xˆl)=∑i=1maiyi1,∑i=1maiyi2,…,∑i=1maiyil+ΨThen it turns out that [30–32] the K–L transform minimizes the MSE (mean square error) for the matrixXand its approximationXˆas follows:(8)EX-Xˆ2=E∑k=1lxk−xˆk2=E∑k=1l∑i=m+1Naiyik2=∑i=m+1NE[∑k=1lyik2]=∑i=m+1NE[aiT(X−Ψ)(X−Ψ)Tai]=∑i=m+1NaiTCXai=∑i=m+1NλiIn Eq. (8), it indicates that if we choose m principal eigenvectors corresponding to the m largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrixCX, the MSE is minimized, being the sum of the N−m smallest eigenvalues.Given a digital image (a two dimensional n×n array of intensity values), we can also represent it as a vector of dimension n2 by1:xn2×1. Assume given a train set of l face images to formXN×lwhere N=n2. Then from Eq. (7), we have,Xˆ=(xˆ1,xˆ2,…,xˆl)=∑i=1maiyi1,∑i=1maiyi2,…,∑i=1maiyil+ΨFrom the equation above, it follows thatxˆk=∑i=1maiyik+Ψ, which indicates that each face (minus the mean)xkcan be represented as a linear combination of the m principal eigenvectors: (a1,a2,…,am). The basis vectors (a1,a2,…,am) are referred as the “eigenfaces” as they are eigenvectors with face-like appearance (Fig. 1).Therefore, each face imagexkis represented in this basis by a weight vector(9)Ωk=y1ky2k⋯ymkFrom Eq. (5), it also follows,YN×l=AT(X−Ψ)=a1Ta2T⋯aNT(X−Ψ)=a1T(X−Ψ)a2T(X−Ψ)⋯aNT(X−Ψ)andX=(x1,x2,…,xl)Then we haveyik=aiT(xk−Ψ). Hencexk=∑i=1maiyik+Ψcan be expressed asxk−Ψ=∑i=1maiyik=∑i=1myikai=∑i=1maiaiT(xk−Ψ)=∑i=1maiT(xk−Ψ)aiBy denotingwik=yik, we write the weight vector (Ωk) for describingxkas follows,(10)Ωk=w1kw2k⋯wmk=y1ky2k⋯ymk=a1T(xk−Ψ)a2T(xk−Ψ)⋯amT(xk−Ψ)In the same way, for a given an unknown face imagex, we project it onto the eigenspace and describe it by a linear combination of the m principal orthogonal components (“eigenfaces”) asx−Ψ=∑i=1mamT(x−Ψ)am. Then we represent the imagexin this basis by a weight vector,(11)Ω=a1T(x−Ψ)a2T(x−Ψ)⋯amT(x−Ψ)=w1w2⋯wmNow, we can determine which face category provides the best description for the unknown imagexbased on the minimum distance betweenΩandΩk(where, the Euclidean or the Mahalanobis distance is commonly used),(12)εk=Ω−Ωk2=∑i=1m(wi−wik)2orεk=∑i=1m1λi(wi−wik)2By employing the eigenface technology, a customer credit measure method based on customer attributes is proposed in this section.Addressing the arrearage problem in China's mobile communication services industry, as described in Section 1, there is a growing awareness that evaluating customer credit is increasingly necessary [1–5,13]. The purpose of credit evaluation is to identify elements which will evaluate customer credit. The elements may be found in the customer attributes. When the elements are determined, customer credit is evaluated (or forecasted) by employing necessary mathematical algorithms based on the quantitative customer attributes.As described in the above section, PCA has widely applied in the computer vision domain, called the eigenface [16–30]. In its typical application for face recognition, a digital image of face is represent by a column vectorxN×1 (N=n2). A train set of l imagesXN×l=(x1,x2,…,xl) is given to generate the eigenspace. Then each face (minus the mean)xk(k=1:l) can be represented as a linear combination of the m principal eigenvectors (a1,a2,…,am). The eigenvectors with face-like appearance are called the “eigenfaces” in the eigenspace. This reduction in dimensions may remove the less useful information and discovery the most effective structure of facial patterns in low dimensions.Similarly, in the eigenface-based customer credit evaluation, each customer is represented by its attribute vectorsxk(k=1,…,l) and a train set of l sample customers is given to form the training setX=XN×l=(x1,x2…,xl). By means of PCA, customers represented by their attribute vectors in the training set are decomposed into orthogonal eigenvectors in the eigenspace. Such one eigenvector ever called “eigenfaces” in the eigenspace is now taken as one basis reference customer (component) for credit evaluation. By selecting m principal eigenvectors (a1,a2,…,am) to build a subspace of eigenspace, each customer now is described by a linear combination of the m principal eigenvectors in the subspace. Then weights of the linear combination are denoted by a weight vector:Ωk=(w1k,…,wmk)T(wik=ymk)and used for customer credit evaluation. In Section 2, it is also shown that the weights in the orthogonal base for describing each given customerxk(k=1,…,l) are defined bywik=yik=aiT(xk−Ψ), which are lengths of projection of the customer represented by its attribute vectorxk(minus the mean) on the basis reference customers represented by the principal eigenvectors.In the similar way, when to evaluate one unknown customer represented by its attribute vectorx, we project it onto the subspace of eigenspace. The customerxis denoted by a linear combination of the principal eigenvectors (called basis reference customers) in the subspace:x−Ψ=∑i=1mamT(x−Ψ)am. Then we describe the customerxby a weight vectorΩ=a1T(x−Ψ),a2T(x−Ψ),…,amT(x−Ψ)Tin the eigenspace.To evaluate the unknown customer represented by its attribute vectorx, it depends on measuring difference or similarities between the unknown customer and the given customers (xk, k=1,…,l) of the training set in the eigenspace. The difference ɛkcan be described by the common Euclidean distance or the Mahalanobis distance between the weight vectorΩ=(w1,w2,…,wm)T(wi=aiT(x−Ψ))of the unknown customer and the weight vectorsΩk=(w1k,w2k,…,wmk)T(wik=aiT(xk−Ψ))(k=1,…,l) of the given customers in the training set by:εk=Ω−Ωk2orεk=∑i=1m1λi(wi−wik)2Accordingly, the eigenface-based customer credit evaluation is composed of the following steps,(1)Given a set of l labeled customer samples as the training setX.The training setXusually includes two-category customers: normal ones and ones in arrears. Each customer is represented by N attributes that are denoted as one attribute vectorxk(k=1,…,l) (l>1),X=XN×l=(x10,x20,…,xl00,xl0+11,xl0+21,…,xl1)wherexi0(1≤i≤l0)denotes l0 normal customers with relatively high credit, whilexj1(l0+1≤l)denotes l1 (=l−l0) customers in arrears with relatively low credit.To compute the average face vector (Ψ) ofXbyΨ=1l∑i=1l0xi0+∑i=l0+1lxi1To compute the covariance matrixCXofXby,CX=(X−Ψ)(X−Ψ)TTo compute the orthogonal eigenvectorsaiofCX, and select m principal (largest) eigenvectors (a1,a2, …,am) to generate the subspace of eigenspace for credit evaluation. When to choose m, the following criterion may be recommended,∑i=1mλi∑i=1Nλi>Threshold(e.g.,0.9or0.95)To describe each labeled customerxkin the training set (xk∈X) onto the subspace of eigenspace by a weight vectorΩk:Ωk=w1kw2k…wmk=a1T(xk−Ψ)a2T(xk−Ψ)…amT(xk−Ψ)(wik=aiT(xk−Ψ))To evaluate one unknown customer represented by its attribute vectorx, we project it onto the subspace of eigenspace and describe the customerxin the subspace by a weight vectorΩ:Ω=w1w2…wm=a1T(x−Ψ)a2T(x−Ψ)…amT(x−Ψ)(wi=aiT(x−Ψ))To compute the common Euclidean distances between the weight vectorΩof the customer and the weight vectorsΩk(1≤k≤l) of the labeled customers in the training set:εk=Ω−Ωk2=∑i=1m(wi−wik)2Then to recognize the customerxto the category of the customerxcin the training set by minimizing the distance: ɛc=min1≤k≤lɛkas follows,(8.1)If 1≤c≤l0 indicates thatxc∈{xi0}, i.e., the customer is classified to the category of customers with relatively high credit.If l0+1≤c≤l indicates thatxc∈{xi1}, i.e., the customer is classified to the category of customers with relatively low credit.In this section, the proposed eigenface-based model is applied to credit evaluation for 400,000 mobile telephone customers in a mobile telephone service company in China. Then further analysis and discussion is presented.Experimental data is collected from a mobile communication company in Guangdong, China. This company serves about 400,000 mobile telephone customers. Having considered both computational and evaluation effectiveness, 18 customer attributes for credit evaluation are chosen and quantified based on statistical analysis. Attributes such as customer's “name”, “sex” and “birth date”, are not chosen for credit evaluation due to statistical ratios of these attributes between normal customers and ones in arrears are approximately equal to 1.0.The following 18 attributes are used for credit evaluation:(1)native or notInternational roaming functionIDD (International direct dial) functionnumber of call transfernumber of new servicesImportant group symbolpersonal credit termsmobile data service symbolform of paymentmonthly tab of new servicestop-service historymonthly tab of SMS (short message service)phone-number selection feemonthly tab of monthly long-distance phoneenrollment dateVIP customer symbolthe corresponding province in the identification cardconsumption level (over the past 3 months)In the eigenface-based credit evaluation, 20 (l=20) chosen samples are taken as the training set. The training set is composed of both 10 normal ones and 10 ones in arrears. Each customer is represented by the 18 (N=18) attributes listed above. Then 15 (m=15) principal orthogonal eigenvectors generated from the training set by means of PCA, are selected to generate the subspace of eigenspace for credit evaluation. Such one principal eigenvector in the subspace, ever called “eigenfaces” for face recognition, is taken as one basis reference customer (component) for credit evaluation. Then as described in the above section, each customer represented by its attribute vector is projected onto the subspace of eigenspace for credit evaluation. Note that in the credit evaluation (steps (1)–(8) in Section 3.2), the Euclidean distance is employed to measure difference between the weight vectors for describing the customers in the eigenspace.Results of credit evaluation for the 400,000 customers in a two-month period are listed in Table 2, and depicted in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.From Table 2, it is shown that 11.27% of the normal customers and 65.44% of ones in arrears are evaluated to be ones of low credit, while 88.73% of the normal customers and 34.56% of ones in arrears are evaluated to be ones of high credit. Correct rate of the credit evaluation for the 400,000 customers is 85.19%.On the same credit evolution task, we continue to examine performance of the proposed eigenface-based model comparing with the well-known BP-ANN (feed-forward back-propagation ANN) model and the artificial immune algorithm (AIA)-based credit measure model [13]. Network structure of the BP-ANN model is set as 18-21-1 which indicates that 18 nodes in the input layer in the network, 21 nodes in the hidden layer, and one node in the output layer. The BP-ANN model uses the linear activation function in the input layer, the sigmoid activation function in both the hidden layer and the output layer. Both the BP-ANN model and the AIA-based credit measure model [13] are set up with 400 (1‰ of the 400,000 customers) customer samples composed of both normal customers and customers in arrears. Then the 2 models are employed to evaluate credits for all the 400,000 customers.Finally, perform comparisons of the proposed eigenface-based model with the BP-ANN model and the AIA-based credit measure model [13] on the same task are listed in Table 3, respectively.In Table 3, it is shown that in terms of total accuracy, the proposed eigenface-based model performs a little better than the BP-ANN model and the AIA-based credit measure model on the credit evaluation task. One explanation for the results may argue that the two categories of customers (normal ones and ones in arrears) are not equally distributed (see Figs. 2 and 3). Actually, since false positives (marking normal customers as ones in arrears) are very undesirable, the results of the proposed method are acceptable for the company.Furthermore, to further describe arrearage management based on credit evaluation is a considerable measure against the arrearage problem, a decision analysis employing the decision-tree is presented below. A decision-tree is a decision analysis tool. The tool uses a tree-like graph to clearly illustrate options and investigate the possible outcomes of choosing the options in its tree structure. It is assumed that the company has two choices as follows:Choice 1: Not to consider credit evaluation and further arrearage management; i.e., just keep it the way it is currently, orChoice 2: To consider further arrearage management based on credit evaluation. Assume such a countermeasure is taken that to set a margin of stopping service for customers with low credit evaluation values while the customers with high credit evaluation values are not limited.On the basis of statistics for the company in the two-month period, it is found:(a)The arrearage ratio of the company over the two months is approximately 20.0%, thus, we assume the Individual Probability of Arrearage to be 20.0%, and then the Individual Probability of Normal to be 80.0%.The average bill of the 400,000 customers over the two months is approximately 180.0Yuans per customer per month (note that one Chinese Yuan roughly equals 0.16$). The threshold of stopping service for customers with low credit evaluation values should be set lower than the monthly average bill of normal customers. Then suppose that the threshold for customers with low credit evaluation values is set as 60.0Yuans per customer per month, which is one-third of the monthly average bill of normal customers.Based on the credit evaluation results (Table 2), following (a) and (b), a decision-tree analysis for the 2 choices is depicted in Fig. 4.From Fig. 4, Table 4lists calculations of EIPCM (Expected Incomes per customer per month) of the two choices.As shown in Table 4, the results of decision-tree analysis indicate that compared with Choice 1, Choice 2 will bring more expected benefits of 4.9 (112.9–108.0) Yuans for each customer in one month. In other words, as the results shown, Choice 2 is expected to benefit the company more than Choice 1. Thus further arrearage management based on the credit evaluation is workable.The eigenface technology is well known for it viewing a face as being a weighted combination of some “component” or “basis” faces based on PCA. The component faces are also called “eigenfaces” as they are eigenvectors with face-like appearance. The approach can reduce data dimension and decomposes face structure into orthogonal components. Then it may discovery the most effective structure of facial patterns in low dimensions. The technique used in creating eigenfaces and using them for recognition has also been used outside of facial recognition.In this study, the eigenface technology is employed to customer credit evaluation and applied to credit evaluation for 400,000 mobile telephone customers of a mobile communication company in Guangdong, China. It is shown that the proposed eigenface-based credit evaluation method yields satisfying results. Correct rate of the credit evaluation for the 400000 customers is near 85.19%. The result is acceptable for the company, which also indicates potentiality of the proposed method that it may also benefit other applications in credit evaluation.China's mobile communication industry is facing more challenges along with its rapid developing. The experimental results indicate that further management based on credit evaluation may be a feasible measure against the arrearage problem. However, to further improve the proposed eigenface-based method for customer credit evaluation will be still included in our further study.
