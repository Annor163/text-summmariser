@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A recently reported Lyapunov based criterion (Singh (2014) [7]) for the asymptotic stability of two-dimensional (2-D) linear discrete systems described by the Fornasini–Marchesini second local state-space (FMSLSS) model is reviewed. It is established in this paper that, despite utilizing a more general Lyapunov matrix, Singh's criterion will never lead to an enhanced stability region in the parameter-space as compared to that obtainable via Hinamoto–Lu's criterion.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
During the past few decades, the stability properties of 2-D discrete systems have been studied extensively [1–12]. The two most common state-space models for 2-D systems were introduced by Roesser [13] and Fornasini–Marchesini [1]. Several Lyapunov equations with constant coefficients have been proposed for the stability analysis of 2-D linear discrete systems described by the FMSLSS model [3–7]. The approaches in [3–6] are based on utilizing a positive definite symmetric Lyapunov matrix. The existence of the positive definite solutions to the Lyapunov equations proposed in [3–7] is, in general, only sufficient but not necessary for 2-D stability. In fact, to the best of authors' knowledge, no numerically tractable constant 2-D Lyapunov matrix inequality which provides both necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of 2-D systems is reported in the literature so far.This paper is directly inspired by a recent paper [7]. Unlike [3–6], Singh's approach [7] makes it possible to utilize even an asymmetric Lyapunov matrix. It is claimed in [7] (see [7, Remark 1]) that Singh's criterion [7] is distinct from that in [3–5]. The purpose of this paper is to establish a link between the approach in [7] and previous approaches [3–5]. In particular, it is shown presently that the obtained stability condition in [7] is equivalent to that in [4,5]. In other words, the criterion in [7] fails to provide an enhanced stability region in the parameter-space as compared to that obtainable via [4,5]. Further, the implication of [7] is discussed in the context of 2-D discrete systems described by the Roesser model [13].Consider a 2-D linear discrete system described by the FMSLSS model [1] given by(1a)x(k+1,l+1)=A1x(k,l+1)+A2x(k+1,l)+B1u(k,l+1)+B2u(k+1,l),(1b)y(k,l)=cx(k,l)+du(k,l),(1c)A=[A1A2],wherek∈Z+andl∈Z+are the spatial variables, andZ+denotes the set of nonnegative integers;x(k,l)∈Rnis the local state vector,u(k,l)the scalar input andy(k,l)the scalar output. The matricesA1,A2,B1,B2,c, d are real constant matrices of appropriate dimensions.The transfer function of (1) is given by [3](2)H(z1,z2)=c(In−z1A1−z2A2)−1(z1B1+z2B2)+d,whereInis then×nidentity matrix. It is known [3–5] that the FMSLSS model (1) is asymptotically stable if and only if(3)det⁡(In−z1A1−z2A2)≠0,for(z1,z2)∈U¯where(4)U¯={(z1,z2):|z1|≤1,|z2|≤1},and ‘det’ stands for determinant.A few criteria for the asymptotic stability of system (1) have been proposed [3–5]. The main result of [3] is the following.Theorem 1(See Hinamoto[3].) Given the positive constants α and β withα+β=1, system(1)is asymptotically stable if there exists a positive definite symmetric matrixP∈Rn×nsuch that(5)[αP00βP]−ATPA>0,where superscript ‘T’ denotes the transpose,0is the null matrix or null vector of appropriate dimension and>0(≥0)signifies that the matrix in context is positive definite (positive semidefinite).Another criterion for the asymptotic stability of (1) has been presented in [4] (see [5] also), which may be stated as follows.Theorem 2(See Lu[4], Hinamoto[5].) Given the positive definite symmetric matricesW01∈Rn×nandW10∈Rn×nwithW01+W10=In, system(1)is asymptotically stable if there exists a positive definite symmetric matrixP=PT/2P1/2∈Rn×nsuch that(6)[PT/2W01P1/200PT/2W10P1/2]−ATPA>0.Theorem 2 constitutes a generalization over Theorem 1. In particular, by selectingW01=αInandW10=βInin Theorem 2, (6) reduces to (5).Very recently, Singh [7] presented the following criterion for the asymptotic stability of (1).Theorem 3(See Singh[7].) Given the positive definite symmetric matricesW01∈Rn×nandW10∈Rn×nwithW01+W10=In, system(1)is asymptotically stable if there exists a matrixP∈Rn×n, not necessarily symmetric, such that(7)Q=[[(P+PT2)T/2W01(P+PT2)1/200(P+PT2)T/2W10(P+PT2)1/2]−PTA−ATPP+PT2]>0.In [7], Theorem 3 (see [7, Theorem 4]) has been stated in the context of the asymptotic stability of 2-D free system given by(8)x(k+1,l+1)=A1x(k,l+1)+A2x(k+1,l).Observe that Theorems 1–3 are based on exploiting the condition (3). Therefore, these results can provide sufficient conditions for the bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stability of system (1) possibly under the assumption that (2) does not possess any non-essential singularity of second kind (see [8] and the references cited therein for a sample of literature on the subject).It may be observed that the positive definite Lyapunov matrixPin Theorems 1 and 2 is symmetric. On the other hand, the matrixPin Theorem 3 is not restricted to be symmetric. The matrixPis referred as asymmetric Lyapunov matrix in the event ofPbeing asymmetric such that(P+PT2)>0.By choosingW01=αInandW10=βInin Theorem 3, one can easily obtain the following corollary (see [7, Corollary 1]).Corollary 1(See Singh[7].) Given the positive constants α and β withα+β=1, system(1)is asymptotically stable if there exists a matrixP∈Rn×n, not necessarily symmetric, such that(9)[[αP+PT200βP+PT2]−ATP−PTAP+PT2]>0.It is worth comparing Singh's approach [7] with previous approaches [3–5].Proposition 1Theorem 3is equivalent toTheorem 2.By Schur complements, (7) is equivalent to(10a)[(P+PT2)T/2W01(P+PT2)1/200(P+PT2)T/2W10(P+PT2)1/2]−ATP(P+PT2)−1PTA>0,(10b)P+PT2>0.WithP=PT, (10) reduces to (6). In other words, (6) implies (7). On the other hand, premultiplying (7) by[I2nAT]and postmultiplying (7) by[I2nAT]T, one obtains(11)[(P+PT2)T/2W01(P+PT2)1/200(P+PT2)T/2W10(P+PT2)1/2]−AT(P+PT2)A>0.In view of (10b),(P+PT2)is a positive definite symmetric matrix. Now, replacing(P+PT2)byPin (11), it follows that (11) is equivalent to (6). Therefore, (7) implies (6). This completes the proof.  □Based on the arguments of Schur complements and congruence transformation, Proposition 1 establishes the equivalence between Theorem 2 and Theorem 3. Such arguments have also been used in the proof of [14, Theorem 1] to introduce additional degrees of freedom in the 1-D Lyapunov equation.With a view to establish a link between [7] and [4,5], let us now examine the approach in [7] carefully. Pertaining to a 2-D free system given by (8), in accordance with [7, Eq. (8)], choose a quadratic 2-D Lyapunov function as(12)Vξς(k,l)=xξςT(k,l)(P+PT2)T/2Wξς(P+PT2)1/2xξς(k,l),wherexξς(k,l)=x(k+ξ,l+ς),W11=W11T=In,W01=W01T>0,W10=W10T>0andP, in general, is an asymmetric matrix such that(P+PT2)>0. The change of energy in both sides of (8), as shown in [7, Eq. (12)], is given by(13)ΔV(k,l)=−[xT(k,l+1)xT(k+1,l)xT(k+1,l+1)]Q[x(k,l+1)x(k+1,l)x(k+1,l+1)],whereQis defined in (7). It is interesting to note that, after some algebraic manipulations, (13) can alternatively be expressed as(14a)ΔV(k,l)=−[xT(k,l+1)xT(k+1,l)xT(k+1,l+1)]R[x(k,l+1)x(k+1,l)x(k+1,l+1)],where(14b)R=[[(P+PT2)T/2W01(P+PT2)1/200(P+PT2)T/2W10(P+PT2)1/2]−(P+PT2)A−AT(P+PT2)P+PT2].In view of (14), ifR>0, thenΔV(k,l)≤0where the equality sign holds only whenx(k,l+1)=x(k+1,l)=0. Since(P+PT2)is a positive definite symmetric matrix, one can replace(P+PT2)inR>0by a positive definite symmetric matrixPwithout loss of generality. In other words, the conditionR>0can equivalently be expressed as(15)[[PT/2W01P1/200PT/2W10P1/2]−ATP−PAP]>0,wherePis a positive definite symmetric matrix. The equivalence of (15) and (6) follows trivially from Schur complements. Moreover, it may be noted that the stability analysis in [7] is based on determining a set of Lyapunov functions given by (12), which involves a general (symmetric or asymmetric)P, such that (7) holds. On the other hand, the analysis in [4,5] is based on determining a set of 2-D Lyapunov functions of the form [5, Eq. (24)](16)Vξς(k,l)=xξςT(k,l)PT/2WξςP1/2xξς(k,l),satisfying (6) wherePis a positive definite symmetric matrix. Nevertheless, it is easy to observe that the Lyapunov function (12) is essentially equivalent to (16). This qualitatively explains why the utilization of asymmetric Lyapunov matrixPin Singh's approach [7] provides no advantage over [4,5].Next, we have the following result.Proposition 2Corollary 1is equivalent toTheorem 1.By selectingW01=αIn,W10=βInand following the proof of Proposition 1, one can easily establish Proposition 2.In view of Propositions 1 and 2, it is clear that Theorem 3 (Corollary 1), despite offering the flexibility of utilizing even an asymmetric Lyapunov matrix, yields no better result than Theorem 2 (Theorem 1). Moreover, it is easy to observe that Theorem 3 (Corollary 1) is numerically more complex than Theorem 2 (Theorem 1). Thus, the approach in [7] fails to provide any specific advantage over Hinamoto–Lu's approach [4,5] for testing asymptotic stability of system (1).  □Consider a zero-input linear shift-invariant quarter plane 2-D discrete system represented by the Roesser model [13](17)[xh(k+1,l)xv(k,l+1)]=[A11A12A21A22][xh(k,l)xv(k,l)],k,l∈Z+wherexh(k,l)∈Rmis the horizontal state vector,xv(k,l)∈Rnis the vertical state vector,A11∈Rm×m,A12∈Rm×n,A21∈Rn×m,A22∈Rn×nare the coefficient matrices.Pertaining to the system (17), the following result is well known.Theorem 4(See Anderson et al.[11].) The system(17)is asymptotically stable if there exist positive definite symmetric matricesPh∈Rm×mandPv∈Rn×nsatisfying(18a)P−ATPA>0,where(18b)P=Ph⊕Pv=[Ph00Pv],A=[A11A12A21A22].By applying the approach in [7], the following result can be established.Theorem 5The system(17)is asymptotically stable if there exist matricesPh∈Rm×mandPv∈Rn×n, not necessarily symmetric, satisfying(19)[P+PT2−ATP−PTAP+PT2]>0,whereP=Ph⊕Pv.Using the arguments given in the proof of Proposition 1, one can easily arrive at the following proposition.Proposition 3Theorem 5is equivalent toTheorem 4.Thus, application of the approach in [7] to the 2-D discrete Roesser model [13] fails to provide enhanced stability region as compared to that obtainable via (18).
