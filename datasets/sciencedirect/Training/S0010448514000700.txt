@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aim of tool path planning is to maximize the efficiency against some given precision criteria. In practice, scallop height should be kept constant to avoid unnecessary cutting, while the tool path should be smooth enough to maintain a high feed rate. However, iso-scallop and smoothness often conflict with each other. Existing methods smooth iso-scallop paths one-by-one, which make the final tool path far from being globally optimal. This paper proposes a new framework for tool path optimization. It views a family of iso-level curves of a scalar function defined over the surface as tool path so that desired tool path can be generated by finding the function that minimizes certain energy functional and different objectives can be considered simultaneously. We use the framework to plan globally optimal tool path with respect to iso-scallop and smoothness. The energy functionals for planning iso-scallop, smoothness, and optimal tool path are respectively derived, and the path topology is studied too. Experimental results are given to show effectiveness of the proposed methods.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The terminology “tool path” refers to a specified trajectory along which machine tools move their ends (i.e., cutter and table) to form desired surfaces. The automatic generation of such trajectories are of central importance in modern CAD/CAM systems. There are two fundamental criteria, i.e., precision and efficiency, for automatic tool path generation. Precision means the error of approximating a surface with a family of curves, and approximating a curve with a family of segments or arcs. Efficiency concerns the time of machining along the tool path. The aim of tool path planning is to maximize the efficiency under the given precision criteria. In this paper, we propose a method, which can take these two criteria into consideration together, to generate globally optimal tool paths.
