@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Software based efficient and reliable ECG data compression and transmission scheme is proposed here. The algorithm has been applied to various ECG data of all the 12 leads taken from PTB diagnostic ECG database (PTB-DB). First of all, R-peaks are detected by differentiation and squaring technique and QRS regions are located. To achieve a strict lossless compression in the QRS regions and a tolerable lossy compression in rest of the signal, two different compression algorithms have used. The whole compression scheme is such that the compressed file contains only ASCII characters. These characters are transmitted using internet based Short Message Service (SMS) and at the receiving end, original ECG signal is brought back using just the reverse logic of compression. It is observed that the proposed algorithm can reduce the file size significantly (compression ratio: 22.47) preserving ECG signal morphology.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a representative signal containing information about the condition of the heart. The shape and size of the P-QRS-T wave and the time intervals between various peaks contain useful information about the nature of possible disease afflicting a heart [1]. P, Q, R, S and T letters were chosen in the early days of ECG history and were chosen arbitrarily [2]. A normal ECG trace is shown in Fig. 1.However, by the very nature of bio-signals, reflection of abnormalities would be random in the timescale. Hence the study of ECG pattern and heart rate variability have to be carried out for extended periods of time (i.e., for 24h) as done in holter monitoring system. Naturally the volume of the data handled would be enormous. Therefore we must need a way to reduce the data storage place. ECG signal compression techniques can be broadly classified into three major categories: (i) direct compression, (ii) transformation methods and (iii) parameter extraction techniques. Direct data compression techniques [3–7] generally retain samples that contain important information and discard the rest. Transformation based compression techniques generally detect the redundancies utilizing the spectral and energy distribution analysis. Among transformation schemes, wavelet transformation [8–13], orthogonal transform [14], discrete cosine transform [15], fast Fourier transform [16] and discrete Legendre transform [17] have been used for compressing the ECG signal. On the other hand parameter extraction methods [18] for compression are mainly based on linear prediction and long-term prediction methods. Beside these, time division multiplexing based method [19], Max–Lloyd quantizer [20], spline approximation [21] and pattern matching methods [22] have also been used in ECG compression. In addition to the previous categorization, ECG signal compression schemes can also be classified into lossy and lossless methods. From juridical and clinical point of view [23,24], lossless compression is very much important.Our intension is to get maximum reduction of ECG data volume without jeopardizing clinical morphology features upon reconstruction. One of the rising issues in rural health care system in India is to broaden the service among the poor population distributed at vast geographical area with poor connectivity in terms of infrastructure. ECG is considered as one of the principal physiological signals to detect the cardiac abnormalities of human being. In [46,47], ECG signal compression techniques were proposed in lossless and lossy manner respectively. These two methods are combined in such a way that the combined method gives better result. The same lossless and lossy compression techniques were also combined in [60] but in a completely different way where standard deviations of different sections of the ECG signal were taken into account. Chief motivation behind this work is to develop a low cost remote tele-cardiology system for compression and transmission of ECG signal which will give support to the rural health care system.In the present work, at first, R peaks are detected using differentiation and squaring technique. ECG data of 160ms (maximum QRS duration) about the R peak are compressed without loss and rest of the signal is compressed with negligible loss of clinical information. The shape and size of QRS complex and its duration have a great significance in disease diagnosis. For example, left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), degree of atrio-ventricular block and so many symptoms can be identified from the QRS complex. Other parts of the ECG wave i.e. P and T wave regions are also very important for ECG interpretation but the lossy compression is not so lossy that those portions would not be identified after reconstruction. Both the lossless and lossy compression methods are such that they outputs only ASCII characters. After compression it is needed to transmit the data to some distant health care center or to some expert cardiologist for immediate action. In recent years, huge numbers of mobile telemedicine system design techniques were proposed in the literature [25–39]. In [34], a telemedicine system was proposed where full channel model with multiple faders, co-channel or adjacent channel interference, and noise profiles were considered as the main modeling parameters of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) channel. GSM link was also used in [40] to develop a portable emergency telemedicine device. Use of Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) [41] and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network [28] was also proposed in telemedicine system. SMS was also used in [42–44] to transmit compressed ECG signal for remote health care system. In [42], the ECG data is encoded using Coding Function, transformed to ASCII codes, and then it is sent using a SMS emulator and mobile phone at the transmitter end. Here the compressed file contains only ASCII characters. Therefore SMS system is used to transmit the compressed data. In the reconstruction part of the algorithm, all messages are taken together and then using just the reverse programming logic of compression, original ECG signal is reconstructed.
