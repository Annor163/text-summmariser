@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We study the acquisition and production planning problem for a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system with core acquisition at two (high and low) quality conditions. We model the problem as a stochastic dynamic programming, derive the optimal dynamic acquisition pricing and production policy, and analyze the influences of system parameters on the acquisition prices and production quantities. The production cost differences among remanufacturing high- and low-quality cores and manufacturing new products are found to be critical for the optimal production and acquisition pricing policy: the acquisition price of high-quality cores is increasing in manufacturing and remanufacturing cost differences, while the acquisition price of low-quality cores is decreasing in the remanufacturing cost difference between high- and low-quality cores and increasing in manufacturing and remanufacturing cost differences; the optimal remanufacturing/manufacturing policy follows a base-on-stock pattern, which is characterized by some crucial parameters dependent on these cost differences.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The manufacturing industry is witnessing a growing practice of firms acquiring and remanufacturing used products returned from end-users, which are usually called cores, to obtain economical benefits and establish social images. Successful examples include the remanufacturing systems of Mercedes-Benz, IBM, DEC and Xerox (Atasu et al., 2008). One of the most important characteristics in such manufacturing/remanufacturing systems is the uncertainty of returns, including the uncertainty in return quantity, quality and timing. To better cope with such uncertainty, a market-driven acquisition channel can be adopted in which an acquisition price is offered to the end-users or core suppliers. With a higher acquisition price, the acquisition quantity for the firm can be larger and the quality of the cores can also be raised. Moreover, a grading procedure can be adopted to classify the cores with different quality conditions. For example, ReCellular, Inc., who is a leading remanufacturer of cellular phones, adopts the grading and pricing scheme in Table 1.In this paper, we consider a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system with core acquisition subject to different quality conditions. The cores are classified into high and low quality levels. In each period, the quality-dependent acquisition prices are set to replenish the inventories of high- and low-quality cores; the stochastic demand is satisfied with the serviceable inventory fulfilled by manufacturing new products and/or remanufacturing the units from the cores inventory; the leftover inventories are carried over to the next period and the shortage is backordered. The incurred costs include the acquisition costs, the remanufacturing and manufacturing costs, and the backordering cost for unsatisfied demand if any. We develop a stochastic dynamic programming to formulate this dynamic acquisition pricing and production planning problem, to minimize the total discounted cost over a finite number of time periods. The optimal production policy is characterized by three parameters, referred to as remanufacture-up-to-level-of-high-quality(RUTL-HQ), remanufacture-up-to-level-of-low-quality(RUTL-LQ), and manufacture-up-to-level(MUTL); the optimal acquisition pricing policy is highly dependent on the cost differences among manufacturing new products and remanufacturing high- and low-quality cores.In what follows, we briefly relate our paper to the literature, including the studies on inventory management of hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing systems, and on core acquisition management in remanufacturing systems.Numerous researchers have studied inventory management of hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing systems. Simpson (1978) first studies a hybrid system with serviceable inventory and repairable inventory in which the demands and returns can be dependent and stochastic, and provides the optimality of a three-parameter inventory policy. Kelle and Edward (1989) consider a different model of independent demand and return processes with all returned products remanufactured. Inderfurth (1997) shows that the policy derived in Simpson (1978) is still optimal in the case of fixed costs and identical leadtimes for remanufacturing and procurement activities. Van Der Laan et al. (1999) analyze push and pull control strategies in a hybrid system, and compare them with the traditional systems without remanufacturing. Teunter et al. (2004) explore the superior inventory strategies for hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing systems with a long leadtime for manufacturing and a short leadtime for remanufacturing. DeCroix and Zipkin (2005) and DeCroix (2006) extend the problems into the multi-echelon inventory setting. Denizel et al. (2010) consider the quality uncertainty of the cores for remanufacturing. Zhou et al. (2011) explore a periodic-review hybrid system with inventories of multiple quality classes of cores, and show that the optimal inventory policy has a simple linear structure when manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are identical. All the above papers assume that the product returns are exogenous and uncontrolled, while our paper focuses on the decisions of acquisition price which are related to the acquisition quantity and quality of the cores.Although the research on hybrid systems is vast, only a few papers consider a market-driven acquisition channel which uses acquisition price to control the quantity and quality of the cores. Guide et al. (2003) is the first to build a quantitative model to analyze acquisition pricing problem for a remanufacturing system with returned products of different qualities. Bakal and Akcali (2006) extend the model to a remanufacturing system with a random yield, and Karakayali et al. (2007) study the problem in a decentralized supply chain environment, with remanufacturer-driven and collector-driven channels, respectively. Galbreth and Blackburn (2006) study the optimal acquisition and sorting policies in the presence of cores condition variability. Then, Galbreth and Blackburn (2010) extend the model to consider optimal acquisition quantity for remanufacturing and scraping in the presence of quality uncertainty. Li et al. (2012) consider the uncertainty in both acquisition quantity and remanufacturing yield. All the above papers consider a pure remanufacturing system under a single-period setting, while our paper studies the acquisition and production planning problem for a hybrid system under a multi-period setting. Moreover, Kaya (2010) investigates the joint decisions of the acquisition price with the remanufacturing and manufacturing quantities under both perfect and partial demand substitution. Zhou and Yu (2011) develop a periodic-review single-product hybrid system with price-dependent customer demand and acquisition effort dependent returns. The optimal production–remanufacturing–disposal policy in the case of exogenous selling price is shown to be simply characterized by three state-independent parameters. The above two papers assume that the quality conditions of acquired cores are homogeneous, while we consider the cases in which the cores can be classified into two quality levels and highlight the role of the remanufacturing cost difference between the quality levels. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to integrate the production planning with the acquisition pricing decisions for the cores of different quality levels in a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we develop a stochastic dynamic programming model for our problem. Section 3 derives the optimal policy of the acquisition prices and the remanufacturing/manufacturing quantities. Section 4 provides numerical experiments to examine the analytical results and generates more insights. Section 5 concludes the paper with future research directions.We consider a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system (shown in Fig. 1) with a serviceable inventory and two core inventories: the inventory for high- and low-quality cores, respectively. The system is operated under a planning horizon of T periods. Demand D(t) in each period is satisfied by the serviceable inventory, which is periodically replenished by newly manufacturing and/or remanufacturing the units from the two cores inventories. At the beginning of each period t, the system first reviews the initial levels of the serviceable inventory I(t), the high-quality cores inventory JH(t) and the low-quality cores inventory JL(t). Then the following decision variables are determined, including: the acquisition prices rH(t) and rL(t) for the high- and low-quality cores, the remanufacturing quantities wH(t) and wL(t) for the high- and low-quality cores, and the manufacturing quantity z(t) of the new products. We assume that the acquisition quantities deterministically depend on the acquisition prices, and the leadtimes of cores acquisition, remanufacturing and manufacturing processes are neglected. Hence, all the decisions in period t are made simultaneously before demand D(t) is realized. After the realization of demand D(t), the shortage is backordered and the leftovers are carried over to next period t+1.This problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) over T time periods. We introduce the elements of this MDP as follows:•State at the beginning of period t is denoted by (I(t), JH(t), JL(t)), which stands for the initial levels of the serviceable inventory and the high- and low-quality cores inventories, respectively.Decision variables are–(rH(t), rL(t)), the acquisition prices of high- and low-quality cores.(wH(t), wL(t), z(t)), the remanufacturing quantities of high- and low-quality cores, and the manufacturing quantity.System parameters–(hH,hL,hs): holding costs per unit for high- and low-quality cores and serviceable products, respectively; and hH⩾hL>0.(cH,cL,cm): remanufacturing cost per unit for the high- and low-quality, and manufacturing cost per unit; and cm⩾cL⩾cH.p: the backordering cost per unit and p⩾cm.Demands D(t), t=1, …, T are mutually independent with continuous probability density function ϕt(·) and distribution function Φt(·), and E[D(t)]<+∞.Acquisition functions SH(rH(t))=aHrH(t)+βHand SL(rL(t))=aLrL(t)+βLare denoted as the acquisition quantities given the acquisition prices rHand rLare offered, respectively. Without loss of generality, we just assume βH=βL=0 to make a simpler exposition of the model. The assumption of deterministic linear acquisition function is widely used in the literature, for example, Guide et al. (2003) and Karakayali et al. (2007).State transition. The state in period t+1 is (I(t+1), JH(t+1), JL(t+1))=I(t)+wH(t)+wL(t)+z(t)−D(t), JH(t)+SH(t)−wH(t), JL(t)+SL(t)−wL(t), where I(t) may take a negative value due to the demand backordering assumption.Performance measure. For ease of notation, we omit the time index of relevant variables whenever possible. The expected cost at period t can be computed byc(t)=aHrH2+aLrL2+hHaHrH+hLaLrL+cmz+(cH-hH)wH+(cL-hL)wL+pE[(I+wH+wL+z-dt)-]+hsE[(I+wH+wL+z-dt)+]+hHJH+hLJL.The objective is to determine the optimal policy on acquisition prices (rH,rL) and (re) manufacturing quantities (wH,wL,z) such that the total discounted expected cost∑t=1Tγt-1c(t)is minimized, where γ is the discount factor with its value in (0,1], subject to the following constraintsrH,rL,z⩾0,0⩽wH⩽JH+aHrH,0⩽wL⩽JL+aLrL.Optimality equation. Letx=I+wH+wL+z,yH=JH+SH-wHandyL=JL+SL-wLbe the serviceable inventory after replenishment and the left-over cores inventories after remanufacturing, respectively. Let gt(x)=pE [(x−D(t))−]+hsE[(x−D(t))+], and(1)Ht(x,yH,yL)=cmx+gt(x)+(cm+hH-cH)yH+(cm+hL-cL)yL+γE[Vt+1(x-dt,yH,yL)].(2)Sr(rH,rL)=(cH+rH-cm)SH+(cL+rL-cm)SL.(3)C(I,JH,JL)=(cm-cH)JH+(cm-cL)JL+cmI.(4)Πt(x,yH,yL,rH,rL)=Ht(x,yH,yL)+Sr(rH,rL)-C(I,JH,JL).Here Htis the production and inventory cost in period t, Sris the acquisition cost minus the cost savings from remanufacturing, and Πtis the objective function for period t.Then, the MDP characterizing this problem can be formulated as(5)Vt(I,JH,JL)=minrH,rL,x,yH,yLΠt(x,yH,yL,rH,rL),t=1,…,T,(6)s.t.VT+1(I,JH,JL)≡0;x+yH+yL⩾I+J′,0⩽yH⩽JH′,0⩽yL⩽JL′;rL,rH⩾0.whereJH′=JH+SH,JL′=JL+SL,J=JH+JL,andJ′=JH′+JL′.Table 2gives a summarization of the important notions used in this paper.We provide the main results on the optimal acquisition, remanufacturing and manufacturing policy and its implication in this section. We first introduce the following variables (the existence and uniqueness of these variables are verified in the Supplementary material of this paper).(7)δt=minx:ddxHt(x,0,0)=0;(8)θtL=minx:ddxHt(x,0,0)-γE∂∂yVt+1(x-dt,0,y)y=0+cL-cm+hL=0;(9)RH1t,RL1t=argminrH,rL⩾0Πt(I+J′,0,0,rH,rL).In particular, denote the value ofRH1t,RL1tin Eq. (8) byrH1t,rL1twhenI+J′=θtL. That is,rH1t,rL1t=argminrH,rL⩾0ΠtθtL,0,0,rH,rL. Then, we can define an important critical numberηtH1as follows:ηtH1=minx:ddxHt(x,0,0)+cH-cm=0,ifcL-cH+γ(cm-cL)·1t⩽hL;θtL-SHrH1t,ifγ(cm-cL)·1t⩽hL<cL-cH+γ(cm-cL)·1t;θtL-SHrH1t-SLrL1t,ifγ(cm-cL)·1t>hL.In the above equations, the indicator function 1tis defined as 1t=1 for t<T and 1t=0 for t=T. Specifically, for t=T, the condition cL−cH+γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hLis reduced to cL−cH⩽hLand γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hLis reduced to hL⩾ 0. We continue to define other optimality numbers.(10)RH2t,RL2t,ΘtL=argminrH,rL,xΠt(x,0,I+J′-x,rH,rL),whererH⩾0,rL⩾0,andI+J⩾ηtH1.(11)RH3t,RL3t=argminrH,rLΠtI+JH′,0,JL′,rH,rL,whererH⩾0,rL⩾0.(12)θtH=minx:ddxHtx,I+JH′-x,JL′=0.(13)RH4t,RL4t=argminrH,rLΠtx∗,JH′,JL′,rH,rL,whererH⩾0,rL⩾0,x∗=maxI,θtH.Using Eq. (11) withI+JH′=θtH, denote thatrH2t,rL2t=argminrH,rL⩾0ΠtθtH,0,JL′,rH,rL.Then, the following critical numbers can be defined as:τt=δt-SHcm-cH2-SLcm-cL2;ΔtL=minx:ddxHt(x,0,0)+cL-cm=0;ηtL=ΔtL-SHcL-cH2,ifγ(cm-cL)·1t⩽hL;ηtH2=ΘtL-SHRH2t;ηtH3=θtH-SHrH2t,ifhL<cL-cH+γ(cm-cL)·1t.We define the remanufacturing cost difference to be cL−cH, as the token of quality difference between the high-quality and low-quality cores. Similarly, cm−cHand cm−cLare the quality difference between the raw material and the high-quality cores, and that between the raw material and the low-quality cores, respectively. The following theorem characterizes the optimal acquisition/remanufacturing/manufacturing policy for the hybrid system which highly depends on the quality differences. (The proofs of this theorem and other results are placed in the Supplementary material attached).Theorem 1(1)The optimal acquisition pricerH∗,rL∗in period t is characterized by:(i)Case: cL−cH+γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hL(14)rH∗,rL∗=cm-cH2,cm-cL2,ifI+J<τt;RH1t,RL1t,ifτt⩽I+J⩽ηtL;RH1t,0,ifηtL⩽I+J⩽ηtH1;(0,0),otherwise;Case: γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hL<cL−cH+γ(cm−cL)·1t(15)rH∗,rL∗=cm-cH2,cm-cL2,ifI+J<τt;RH1t,RL1t,ifτt⩽I+J<ηtH1;RH2t,0,ifI+J⩾ηtH1andI+JH<ηtH2;RH3t,0,ifηtH2⩽I+JH<ηtH3;RH4t,0,ifI+JH⩾ηtH3;Case: hL<γ(cm−cL)·1t(16)rH∗,rL∗=cm-cH2,cm-cL2,ifI+J<τt;RH1t,RL1t,ifτt⩽I+J<ηtH1;RH2t,RL2t,ifI+J⩾ηtH1andI+JH<ηtH2;RH3t,RL3t,ifηtH2⩽I+JH<ηtH3;RH4t,RL4t,ifI+JH⩾ηtH3;The optimal production quantities for the new products, the high-quality cores and the low-quality coresz∗,wH∗,wL∗are characterized by:(17)z∗=δt-I-J′ifI+J′<δt;0,otherwise.(18)wH∗=JH′,ifI+JH′<θtH;θtH-I,ifI<θtH⩽I+JH′;0,otherwise;(19)wL∗=JL′,ifI+J′<θtL;ΘtL-I-JH′,ifI+J′⩾θtLandI+JH′<ΘtL;0,otherwise;whereδt⩽θtL⩽ΘtL⩽θtH, andJH′=JH+SHrH∗,JL′=JL+SLrL∗, and (I,JH,JL) are the initial inventory levels of serviceable, high-quality and low-quality cores in period t, ∀ t=1, …, T. Furthermore,δt,θtLandθtHare state-independent, whileΘtLis dependent on I+J, andΘtL≡θtLif cL−cH+γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hL.Theorem 1 shows the optimal acquisition pricing decisions characterized by (14)–(16). For example, in period t, whenI+J>ηtH1, we haverL∗=0, if γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hL. That is, the firm should pay no effort to acquire any low-quality core if the total initial inventories of the serviceable product and returned cores are greater thanηtH1and the discounted cost difference between newly manufacturing and low-quality core remanufacturing γ (cm−cL)·1tis not larger than hL. This is because in this case of sufficient total inventory for remanufacturing, the cost of acquiring a low-quality core and holding it for remanufacturing in the next period, hL+rL, is higher than the potential cost saving compared to manufacturing new products γ(cm−cL)·1t, and thus no low-quality cores should be acquired. For another example, whenI+J>ηtH1, we haverH∗=0, if cL−cH+γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hL. That is, the firm should pay no effort to acquire any low-quality cores if the total initial inventories of serviceable products and cores are greater thanηtH1and the discounted cost difference cL−cH+γ(cm−cL)·1tis no larger than hL. This is because in this case, the net cost of acquiring a high-quality core and holding it for remanufacturing in the next period, rH+cH+hL−γ(cm−cL)·1t, is higher than the remanufacturing cost of a low-quality core cL, and thus no high-quality cores should be acquired.Theorem 1 also shows the optimal manufacturing/remanufacturing policy characterized by (17)–(19). First, after making the acquisition prices and observing the new inventory levels, i.e.,I,JH′,JL′, the firm will not remanufacture any cores if the serviceable inventory level is larger thanθtH; otherwise, it needs to only remanufacture the high-quality cores as many as possible so that the serviceable inventory level can reach up toθtH. Second, after remanufacturing the high-quality cores, if the serviceable quantity is less thanΘtLbut higher than δt, the firm will remanufacture the low-quality cores as many as possible so that the serviceable inventory level can reach up toΘtL. Finally, if the serviceable inventory level is less than δtafter remanufacturing all cores, the firm will manufacture new products so that the serviceable inventory can reach up to the level, δt. Hence, in the optimal production policy we callθtH,ΘtL, and δtas remanufacture-up-to-level -of-high-quality (RUTL-HQ), remanufacture-up-to-level-of-low-quality (RUTL-LQ), and manufacture-up-to-level (MUTL), respectively.From the above discussion, we find that remanufacturing the high-quality cores always takes the first priority to replenish the serviceable inventory, due to its lowest cost. Hence, the high-quality cores are always firstly used up and firstly acquired. Remanufacturing the low-quality cores is the second choice and manufacturing new products is the last choice. Remanufacturing the low-quality cores and manufacturing new products will never be adopted if the high-quality cores inventory is positive after remanufacturing, i.e.,I+JH′>ΘtL. Moreover, the low-quality cores are also never acquired if the high-quality cores are not acquired, if γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hL.It is worth to pointing out that, acquired cores will be kept for the future use when the total initial inventories in the current period are high, i.e.,I+J>θtL. The reason behind this is the uncertainty of customer demand. More specifically, as the demand is stochastic, the inventory at the beginning of next period is also uncertain. If the initial inventory level of next period is too low, the firm has to acquire many cores for remanufacturing by setting a higher acquisition price. Therefore, if he uses up all the cores in the current period, the firm may have to acquire many cores with larger cost in the next period. This is not optimal. The firm can instead, as the model indicates, keeps some cores in the current period for future use to counter against the demand uncertainty risk.Based on Theorem 1, we can obtain the following structural properties of the optimal policy on the system states and parameters.Proposition 2(i)The optimal acquisition pricesrH∗andrL∗are decreasing in (I+JH,I+J) and I+J, respectively. In particular,rHc⩾RH1t⩾RH2t⩾RH3t⩾RH4t, andrLc⩾RL1t⩾RL2t⩾RL3t⩾RL4t;The optimal acquisition prices satisfyrH∗+cH⩽cmandrL∗+cL⩽cm.The results are intuitive. Part (i) indicates that the optimal acquisition prices and thus the acquisition quantities are decreasing in the total amount of the cores inventories. Part (ii) indicates that the optimal acquisition price of low-(high-) quality cores does not exceed the cost difference between newly manufacturing and remanufacturing low-(high-) quality cores, respectively.Proposition 3The influences of quality differences on the acquisition prices are as follows:(i)rH∗is increasing in cm−cHand cL−cH, respectively. Moreover,RH2t=RH3t=RH4t=0if cL−cH+γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hL;rL∗is increasing in cm−cLand decreasing in cL−cH. Moreover,RL2t=RL3t=RL4t=0if γ(cm−cL)·1t⩽hL.The inequalitiesRH1t⩾RL1tandRH2t⩾RL2thold simply because of cL⩾cH.When γ(cm−cL)1t>hL, it is possible thatRH3t<RL3tandRH4t<RL4t. Specially, if γ(cL−cH)1t<hH−hL, it is always true thatRH4t<RL4t.This proposition indicates that the optimal acquisition price of the high-quality cores is closely dependent on the quality differences. That is, the acquisition price of high-quality cores is increasing in the cost differences between remanufacturing high- and low- quality cores, and between remanufacturing high-quality cores and manufacturing new products. This is because the increases in such differences will amplify the cost saving from remanufacturing the high-quality cores. In a similar vein, the acquisition price of low-quality cores is decreasing in the cost difference between remanufacturing low- and high- quality cores, and increasing in the difference between remanufacturing low-quality cores and manufacturing new products.Furthermore, part (iii) implies that when both high- and low-quality cores are remanufactured, it is always optimal to set a higher price for the high-quality. From part (iv), we see that when the total inventory of cores is large enough such that all of the low-quality cores are held to the next period, it may be optimal to set a lower price for the high-quality. The condition γ(cL−cH)1t<hH−hLis equivalent to hH−γ(cH−cm)>hL−γ(cL−cm), meaning that the net marginal cost saving of the high-quality cores is less than that of the low-quality cores. Therefore, the high-quality acquisition price cannot be larger than the low-quality one.In this section we conduct computational experiments to further examine the effects of quality differences and other system parameters. We assume that the demands follow uniform distributions, i.e., dt∼U[0,Mt]. The base parameter settings are as follows:cm=30;cL=25;cH=22;hs=10;hH=8;hL=6;p=50;aH=10;aL=10;γ=0.6;Mt=100,∀t;I=50;JH=0;JL=0;T=10.Since cL−cH+γ(cm−cL)=6⩽hL, this is a case of small quality difference. In such a case, as we know from Theorem 1, all the optimality parametersδt,θtL,θtHand the critical numbersτt,ηtL,ηtH1are state independent. Only the optimal acquisition pricerH∗,rL∗is state dependent. We then solve the acquisition prices by setting the initial inventory values to be I=50, JH=0 and JL=0 in each period.The optimal solutions under the base setting is shown in Table 3. The results clearly show thatτt<ηtL<ηtH1<θtL,δt<θtL⩽θtHandrH∗(t)⩾rL∗(t)for every period t.Experiment 1. We now investigate the effects of quality differences. To simplify the computation, we restrict to the case where γ(cm−cL)1t⩽hL. In this experiment, we fix cm=30 and (I,JH,JL)=(10,0,0) and study the changes ofrH∗,rL∗with different values of cLand cH.First, Fig. 2a shows that the acquisition price of high-quality cores is increasing in cL, while the acquisition price of low-quality cores is decreasing in cL. Second, Fig. 2b shows that the acquisition price of high-quality cores is decreasing in cH, while the low-quality acquisition price is increasing in cH. These results are consistent with the result of Proposition 3. Fig. 2 also clearly shows thatrH∗is always larger thanrL∗, which is consistent with Proposition 2(ii). Moreover, we observerH∗=rL∗when cL=cH.Experiment 2. We first examine the effect of demand patterns on the optimal decisions, with the results illustrated in Fig. 3. In the first scenario, Mts are the same in every period t, which implies the demands are i.i.d. In scenario 2, where Mtis increasing in t, the firm faces growing demands over periods, since Φt(x)⩾Φt+1(x). Scenarios 3 and 4 illustrate the cases of decreasing demands and more fluctuating demands, respectively. We can see from Fig. 3 thatδt,θtLandθtHhave the same trend as the demand pattern.We also investigate, numerically, the effect of demand patterns on the acquisition pricing decision, as shown in Fig. 4. In general, rHand rLhave the same trend as the demand pattern. This is intuitive since, for example, when the demand is stochastically increasing, the firm will acquire more cores for remanufacturing.Experiment 3. This set of experiments aim to analyze the effects of other costs. First, we study the effect of the backordering cost p. Without loss of generality, we only focus onδ10,θ10L,θ10H,δ6,θ6L,θ6H. Fig. 5shows thatδt,θtLandθtHare increasing in p, respectively. In particular, compared toθtH,θtLis more sensitive thanθtHto p, and δtis further more sensitive thanθtLto p. As p increases, however, such sensitivity becomes less. Comparing the two sub-figures in Fig. 5, we find that these effects of p are enhanced over periods of time. Furthermore, Fig. 6shows that both rH(t) and rL(t) are increasing in p.Experiment 4. This set of experiments aim to analyze the effect of remanufacturing/manufacturing costs on the production policy. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the optimal base-on-stock parameters for remanufacturing/manufacturing become smaller as any of the remanufacturing/manufacturing costs decreases.In this paper, we have explored the optimal acquisition pricing and production planning policy in a hybrid manufacturing/remanufacturing system, when there are two quality levels of acquired cores: high- and low-quality. The optimal policies of acquisition pricing and production quantities are derived. It is found that the optimal acquisition prices for high- and low-quality cores are highly dependent on the quality difference between the high- and low-quality cores and the cost difference between manufacturing and remanufacturing. The acquisition prices are decreasing in the initial inventory levels. Also, the acquisition price of high-quality cores is increasing in the quality difference between high- and low- quality cores, while the acquisition price of low-quality cores is decreasing in this difference and increasing in the cost difference of remanufacturing the low-quality cores and manufacturing new products. The optimal production policy, on the other hand, is characterized by the crucial parameters MUTL, RUTL-LQ and RUTL-MQ, which are based on the order-up-to strategies.Our work, however, has some limitations. First, we assume that acquisition quantities are linear and deterministic functions of the acquisition prices. It is worthwhile to extend the current work to cases of more generalized acquisition functions or/and stochastic acquisition quantities. Second, we assume two classes of cores qualities, while the case of multiple quality classes of cores can be considered further which may be more practical. Finally, we consider a hybrid system in which the remanufactured and manufactured products are of the same quality and indistinguishable by the customer. Relaxing this assumption to the case of partially substitution of remanufactured and manufactured products can be another future research direction.
