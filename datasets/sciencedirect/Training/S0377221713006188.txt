@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we consider a two-state (up and down) network consisting of n links. We study the D-spectrum based dynamic reliability of the network under the assumption that the links are subject to failure according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Several mixture representations are provided for the reliability function of residual lifetime of used networks, under different conditions on the status of the network or its links. These representations enable us to explore the residual reliability of operating networks in terms of the reliability functions of residual lifetimes of upper record values. The distribution function of inactivity time of a network is examined under the condition that the network has failed by inspection time t. Stochastic ordering properties of the residual lifetimes of networks under conditional D-spectra are investigated. Several examples and graphs are also provided to illustrate the established results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Communication networks play an important role in communication theory, and so their reliability analysis is of great interest. A network is a collection of nodes and links in which some particular nodes in the network are called terminals. As examples of nodes, one can think of rail stations, road intersections, telecommunication centers, etc.; similarly, as examples of links, one can think of rail ways, communication channels, connections between the components of a system, etc. A network model can be considered as a tripletN=(V,E,T), in which V denotes the node set with|V|=m,Estands for the link set with|E|=n, andT⊆Vis the set of all terminals. The network is said to be T-connected if all the terminals are connected to each other. In the reliability viewpoint, the links (or nodes) are subject to failure which may occur according to a stochastic mechanism. Failure of the links (or nodes) may change the state of the network. The states of a network are defined based on whether there are connections between the terminals or not. Two terminals are said to be connected if there is a set of links connecting them.In many situations, the networks involve multi-states. However, in what follows, we assume that the network has only two states, viz., up and down, and assume that the links are subject to failure. If the failure of a single component (link or node) either does not change the state of the network or changes it by decreasing by one, then the network is said to be a single-step network. Otherwise, we call it a multi-step network. In this paper, we assume that the network is single-step and denote the network links, that are subject to failure, bye1,e2,…,en.One important concept useful in the study of network reliability is D-spectrum which depends only on the structure of the network; see Gertsbakh and Shpungin (2011) for general multivariate case wherein the networks are multi-steps. In order to explain a D-spectrum, we first need to define an anchor. Letπ=(ei1,ei2,…,ein)be a permutation of network links (nodes), and suppose all the components in this permutation are in the up state. Then, we move along the permutation from left to right, and turn the state of each component from up state to down state. Leteirbe the first element when the state of the network changes to down state. Then, the anchorπ, denoted byr(π), is defined to be the ordinal number of this elementeirin the permutation. Under the equally likely assumption for all permutations, each permutation of n links (nodes) evidently has probability1/n!. Now, we present the following definition.Definition 1.1The discrete probability vectorf=(f1,f2,…,fn),wherefi=P(r(π)=i),fori=1,…,n, is said to be the destruction spectrum (D-spectrum) associated with the network.Ifnidenotes the total number of permutations for which the corresponding anchor equals i, then evidentlyfi=ni/n!. The cumulative D-spectrum is then simply defined asF(i)=∑j=1ifj;that is,F(i)is the distribution function of the number of components to be destroyed to induce the transition from an up state to down state. It is of interest to mention here that the vector D-spectrum defined above is identical to the signature vector, defined by Samaniego (1985), used extensively in the study of coherent systems.The study on the reliability of the networks under different aspects, has been considered by researchers for many years (see, for example, Agrawal and Barlow (1984) and the references cited therein). Recently, there has been much interest and focus on the lifetime network and system reliability based on the concept of signatures; see, for example, Boland, Samaniego, and Vestrup (2003), Navarro, Balakrishnan, and Samaniego (2008, 2010), Navarro and Rychlik (2007, 2010), Zhang (2010), Gertsbakh and Shpungin (2009, 2011, 2012), Levitin, Gertsbakh, and Shpungin (2011), Eryilmaz (2011, 2012) and Balakrishnan and Asadi (2012). The developments on the reliability and lifetime properties of coherent systems, however, are mainly based on the assumption that the system has n independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) (or independent and exchangeable) components. Under this assumption, the signaturesof the coherent system is defined as a n-dimensional probability vector whose ith element issi=P(T=Xi:n), where T is the lifetime of the system andXi:nis the ith ordered lifetime of the components. In order to investigate the reliability characteristics of the system lifetime, the main idea used in the above mentioned references and many others in the literature is the fact that the signatures are distribution-free and that the theory of order statistics of the component lifetimes is applicable.In this paper, however, we assume that the links of a network are subject to failure according to a well-known counting process called nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). Recall that a counting process{N(t),t⩾0}is a stochastic process that represents the number of events in interval[0,t]. The counting process{N(t),t⩾0}is said to be a NHPP with intensity functionλ(t), if.(i)N(0)=0,N(t)has independent increments,P{N(t+h)-N(t)⩾2}=o(h),P{N(t+h)-N(t)=1}=λ(t)h+o(h).Denoting the time to the kth event of the NHPP bySk, it can be shown that the survival functionG¯k(t)ofSkis given by(1)G¯k(t)=P(Sk>t)=P(N(t)<k)(2)=∑x=0k-1[Λ(t)]xx!e-Λ(t),t>0,k=0,1,2,…,whereΛ(t)=E(N(t))=-logG¯(t), andG¯(t)is the reliability function of the time to the first event. The functionΛ(t)is called the mean value function (m.v.f.) andλ(t)=dΛ(t)/dtis known as the intensity function. In fact, a NHPP is a Poisson process with rate parameterλ(t)being a function of time. For more details on the properties of NHPP and related processes, one may refer to Nakagawa (2011).The reliability function in (2) arises also naturally as the reliability function of upper record values in the sequence of independent non-negative random variables (r.v.’s)X1,X2,…generated fromG(t), the distribution function of the time to the first event (see Arnold, Balakrishnan, and Nagaraja (1998)). More precisely, assume thatXi’s have a common absolutely continuous distribution function G and survival functionG¯=1-G. Define a sequence of record timesU(n),n=1,2,…, as follows:U(1)≡1,U(n+1)=minj:j>U(n),Xj>XU(n),n⩾1.Then, the r.v.’sXU(n)(n⩾1)are called upper records; that is, the observationXjis an upper record value (or simply a record) if it exceeds all previous observations. For convenience in notation, we denoteXU(n)byRnand{Rn,n⩾1}as the sequence of record values. If g denotes the probability density function (pdf) of G, then the pdf ofRkis given by(3)g(k)(t)=g(t)[Λ(t)]k-1(k-1)!,t>0,k=1,2,…;for more details, see Arnold, Balakrishnan, and Nagaraja (1998). This shows that, in NHPP with m.v.f.Λ(t)=-logG¯(t),Rk=dSk,k=1,2,…, where=ddenotes equality in distribution. In other words, an NHPP is essentially a record counting process in the sense that if its m.v.f.Λ(t)is continuous and tends to∞ast→∞, then the sequence of occurrence times of NHPP can be considered as the record values of a sequence of i.i.d. r.v.’s each having distribution functionG(see Gupta and Kirmani (1988)).In the present work, we study the dynamic version of network reliability under the following set-up. Consider a network with n links and suppose that the failures of links occur according to a NHPP with m.v.f.Λ(t)=-logG¯(t). The events in this counting process appear at the instantsRk,k=1,2,…. We shall assume that all orders of failures of links have equal probability of occurrence. Further, suppose the network can be in one of two states, viz., up or down. Then, with T denoting the lifetime of the network, it is easy to show that the corresponding reliability function can be expressed as(4)P(T>t)=∑k=1nfkP(Rk>t),t>0,whereR1,R2,…,Rnare the first n records from a sequence of i.i.d. non-negative r.v.’s with common survival functionG¯, andfk=P(T=Rk),k=1,…,n, is the kth element of the D-spectrum vectorf=(f1,…,fn).Remark 1.2It is useful to observe that the reliability function in (4), which is a mixture representation of the network reliability in terms of reliability functions of the first n records from the sequence of i.i.d. non-negative r.v.’s, is analogous to the mixture form of the reliability function of a n-component coherent system in terms of reliability functions of order statistics from a sample of size n, due to Samaniego (1985).The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, under the assumption that the network is operating at time t, we obtain a mixture representation for the reliability of residual lifetime of the network in terms of the residual reliability of upper record values. In this process, we arrive at a vector of time dependent D-spectrum that enables us to get some stochastic ordering results comparing two different networks. Section 3 is devoted to the inactivity time of the network. Herein, we obtain a mixture representation for the reliability of inactivity time of the network under the condition that the network has already failed by inspection time t. Several stochastic ordering results are presented in this section. In Section 4, we study the residual lifetime of the network under two different conditions. First, we obtain the reliability of the residual lifetime of the network working at time t with exactly k failed links at that time. Then, in the sequel, we obtain the reliability of the residual lifetime of the network after the failure of the kth link in the network. These two cases lead to the definition of a new concept called dynamic D-spectrum. Different representations and stochastic ordering results are presented as well in this section. To illustrate the importance of the results established here, various examples and graphs are also provided.Throughout the paper, increasing (decreasing) is used to mean non-decreasing (non-increasing).With T denoting the lifetime of a network as described above, and assuming that the network is up at time t, the residual lifetime of the network is simply given by the conditional random variableTt=T-t|(T>t). Then, from the representation in (4), for allx,t>0, the reliability function ofTtcan be obtained as follows:(5)P(T-t>x|T>t)=1P(T>t)∑k=1nfkP(Rk>t+x)=∑k=1nfkP(Rk>t)P(T>t)P(Rk>t+x|Rk>t)=∑k=1npk(t)P(Rk-t>x|Rk>t),where(6)pk(t)=fkP(Rk>t)∑k=1nfkP(Rk>t),k=1,…,n.The representation in (5) shows that the reliability function of the residual lifetime of the network is a mixture of reliability functions of residual lifetimes of the first n upper records from the sequence of i.i.d. non-negative r.v.’s with common distribution function G, where the mixing probability vector isp(t)=(p1(t),…,pn(t)). It is evident that the elements ofp(t)depend on both the structure of the network and the distributionG(t). It is of interest to note thatpk(t)is in fact the probability that the kth link causes the failure of the network, given that the lifetime of the network is more than t; that ispk(t)=P(T=Rk|T>t),k=1,2,…,n.This is so becauseP(T=Rk|T>t)=P(T>t|T=Rk)P(T=Rk)P(T>t)=P(Rk>t|T=Rk)P(T=Rk)P(T>t)=fkP(Rk>t)∑k=1nfkP(Rk>t)=pk(t),where the last equality follows from (4). As the vectorp(t)indicates the conditional probability vector of the number of components to be destroyed given that the network has survived beyond t, in what follows, we call it conditional D-spectrum of the network. From (6), it is easily seen that, for anyk,limt→0pk(t)=fkand consequentlylimt→0p(t)=f.Some further results on the limiting behavior ofp(t)are presented in Theorem 2.9.Next, the failure rate of the network is given byλT(t)=∑k=1nfkg(k)(t)∑k=1nfkG¯(k)(t)=∑k=1npk(t)λRk(t),whereλRk(t)is the failure rate ofRk. Thus,p(t)is seen to be the mixing probability vector in the mixture form of the failure rate of the network lifetime as well.Example 2.1Consider the network in Fig. 1, which has four links, four nodes and three terminals. We assume that the links are subject to failure. Network is up if and only if all the terminals are connected to each other.The network never fails when only one link fails. Therefore,f1=0. Analyzing4!=24permutations of four links, it is easy to find out that the network fails when exactly two (three) links fail in 20 (4) situations out of 24. After the failure of three links, the network is always down. Hence, the D-spectrum of the network in this case isf=0,56,16,0. Let the failures of the links of this network occur according to a NHPP with m.v.f.Λ(t)=λt. Then, we havep(t)=0,5+5λt6+6λt+12(λt)2,1+λt+12(λt)26+6λt+12(λt)2,0,and soP(T-t>x|T>t)=5+5λt6+6λt+12(λt)2P(R2-t>x|R2>t)+1+λt+12(λt)26+6λt+12(λt)2P(R3-t>x|R3>t)=e-λx6+6λ(x+t)+12(λ(x+t))26+6λt+12(λt)2.Note thatlimt→∞p(t)=(0,0,1,0)andp(0)=0,56,16,0. These mean that, when t goes to∞, the residual lifetime of the network is equivalent to the residual lifetimeR3-t|(R3>t), while at the origin, the coefficient vector is simply the D-spectrum vector f.Next, the failure rate of the network at time t is seen to beλT(t)=5+5λt6+6λt+12(λt)2λR2(t)+1+λt+12(λt)26+6λt+12(λt)2λR3(t)=λ2t12+12λt+(λt)210+λt.LetF¯(i)=∑j=i+1nfj,i=0,…,n-1, be the survival function of the D-spectrum associated with the network. From (2), we see thatpk(t)(fork=1,…,n) in (6) can be expressed as(7)pk(t)=fk∑i=0k-1[Λ(t)]ii!∑i=0n-1F¯(i)[Λ(t)]ii!,or equivalently,(8)pk(t)=fkψ(k,t)∑i=1nfiψ(i,t),whereψ(i,t)=Γ(i;Λ(t))/Γ(i),i=1,…,n, andΓ(k;t)=∫t∞xk-1e-xdxis the upper incomplete gamma function. An immediate consequence of (7) is that, for allt>0,k=1,2,…,n-1,pk(t)⩽pk+1(t)if and only iffk⩽fk+1.The next lemma will be useful in obtaining some properties of the residual lifetime of the network. Before presenting the lemma, we give the following definitions which will be used throughout the paper.Definition 2.2Let X and Y be two r.v.’s with distribution functions F and G, survival functionsF¯=1-FandG¯=1-G, and density functions f and g, respectively. Then:(i)X is said to be smaller than Y in the usual stochastic order, denoted byX⩽stY, ifF¯(t)⩽G¯(t)for all t;X is said to be less than Y in the hazard order (reversed hazard order), denoted byX⩽hrY(X⩽rhY), ifG¯(t)F¯(t)G(t)F(t)is an increasing function of t;X is said to be smaller than Y in the likelihood ratio order, denoted byX⩽lrY, ifg(t)f(t)is increasing in t.Let A and B be two subsets of the real line. A function K defined onA×Bis said to be totally positive of order 2, denoted TP2, if for alla1<a2,b1<b2,(ai∈A,bi∈B,i=1,2),K(a2,b2)K(a1,b1)-K(a1,b2)K(a2,b1)⩾0.Letδ(j,t)be an arbitrary function on{1,2,…}×(0,∞)andaj⩾0,j=1,…,n. Ifδ(j,t)is TP2, thenηk(t)=∑j=knajδ(j,t)∑j=1najδ(j,t),k=1,2,…,n,is increasing in t.To get the required result, we need to show that fort1⩽t2,ηk(t2)⩾ηk(t1),or equivalently,(9)∑i=1n∑j=knaiajδ(j,t2)δ(i,t1)-δ(j,t1)δ(i,t2)⩾0.Since∑i=kn∑j=knaiajδ(j,t2)δ(i,t1)-δ(j,t1)δ(i,t2)=0,the inequality in (9) is equivalent to(10)∑i=1k-1∑j=knaiajδ(j,t2)δ(i,t1)-δ(j,t1)δ(i,t2)⩾0.Ifδ(j,t)is TP2 in j and t, thenδ(j2,t)δ(j1,t)is increasing in t forj1⩽j2, and so the inequality in (10) holds. Hence, the lemma.□The following theorem shows that the conditional D-spectrump(t)is increasing in the sense of stochastic ordering.Theorem 2.5Letp(t) be the conditional D-spectrum in(8)of a network with n links. Then,p(t1)⩽stp(t2)for all0⩽t1⩽t2.Letk(j,t)=Γ(j;t)Γ(j)andhj1,j2(t)=k(j2,t)k(j1,t)forj1⩽j2. Then, we have∂∂thj1,j2(t)=Γ(j1)Γ(j2)Γ2(j1;t)tj1-1e-t∫t∞xj2-1e-xdx-tj2-1e-t∫t∞xj1-1e-xdx.Since∫t∞xj2-1e-xdx=∫t∞xj2-j1+j1-1e-xdx⩾tj2-j1∫t∞xj1-1e-xdx,we have∂∂thj1,j2(t)⩾0so thathj1,j2(t)is increasing in t. SinceΛ(t)is increasing int,hj1,j2(Λ(t))is also consequently increasing in t. Then,ψ(j,t)in representation (8) is TP2 in j and t, and the required result then follows using Lemma 2.4.□The following theorem is used to compare the performance of two networks based on their conditional D-spectra.Theorem 2.6Letp1(t)andp2(t)be the conditional D-spectra in representation(5)of two networks, both based on n links. Suppose the failures of links in both networks occur according to the same NHPP. IfT1andT2denote the corresponding lifetimes of the networks, then:(a)p1(t)⩽stp2(t)implies thatT1-t|(T1>t)⩽stT2-t|(T2>t);p1(t)⩽hrp2(t)implies thatT1-t|(T1>t)⩽hrT2-t|(T2>t);p1(t)⩽lrp2(t)implies thatT1-t|(T1>t)⩽lrT2-t|(T2>t).By Theorem 3.1 of Kochar (1990), we can writeRk⩽lrRk+1,k=1,…,n-1. Then from Theorem 1.C.6 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), we have, fork=1,…,n-1andt⩾0,Rk-t|(Rk>t)⩽lrRk+1-t|(Rk+1>t).Hence, these residual lifetimes are also hr- and st-ordered. Sincep1(t)⩽stp2(t), from Theorem 1.A.6 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), we have, for allx>0,P(T1-t>x|T1>t)=∑k=1np1,k(t)P(Rk-t>x|Rk>t)⩽∑k=1np2,k(t)P(Rk-t>x|Rk>t)=P(T2-t>x|T2>t).This establishes part (a). Proof of parts (b) and (c) are obtained similarly by using Theorems 1.B.14 and 1.C.17 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), respectively.□The following lemma is useful for developing subsequent results.Lemma 2.7Letν(i)be an arbitrary non-negative function on{0,1,…,n}andai⩾0,i=1,…,n. The functionsζ1k(t)andζ2k(t),k=1,…,n, defined as(a)ζ1k(t)=∑j=knaj∑i=0j-1ν(i)ti∑j=1naj∑i=0j-1ν(i)ti,ζ2k(t)=∑j=knaj∑i=jnν(i)ti∑j=1naj∑i=jnν(i)ti,We prove part (a), while part (b) can be proved in an analogous manner. Withϕ(j,t)=∑i=0j-1ν(i)ti, we have, forj1⩽j2,ϕ(j2,t)ϕ(j1,t)=1+∑i=j1j2-1ν(i)ti∑i=0j1-1ν(i)ti=1+∑m=j1j2-1ν(m)∑i=0j1-1ν(i)ti-m.Sinceti-m,i=0,…,j1-1,m=j1,…,j2-1, is decreasing in t, we can conclude thatϕ(j2,t)ϕ(j1,t)is increasing in t. Then,ϕ(j,t)is TP2, and consequentlyζ1k(t)is increasing in t from Lemma 2.4.□Consider a network consisting of n links. Suppose the failures of links of the network occur according to two different NHPP’s with m.v.f.’sΛ1(t)=-logG¯1(t)andΛ2(t)=-logG¯2(t), respectively. If, for allt,G¯1(t)⩽G¯2(t), thenpG1(t)⩾stpG2(t).Letν(i)=1i!andai=fi,i=1,…,n, in Lemma 2.7. SinceG¯1(t)⩽G¯2(t)implies thatΛ1(t)⩾Λ2(t), the required result is obtained by using part (a) of Lemma 2.7 and the fact that∑i=knpiGj(t)=ζ1k(Λj(t)),j=1,2.□Consider a network with n links, and assume that its D-spectrum is of the form(11)f=(f1,…,fν,…,fn),whereνis between l and u withl=min{i|fi>0}andu=max{i|fi>0}. In fact, l represents the minimum number of failed links that would cause the failure of the network, whileu-1is the maximum number of failed links with which the network would still work.By considering this general form for the D-spectrum of the network, we can establish the following theorem.Theorem 2.9Let the D-spectrum of the network be of the form(11). Then,limt→0pk(t)=fkand(12)limt→∞pk(t)=1,k=u0,k≠u.If the D-spectrum of the network is of the form (11), from (7),pk(t)can be expressed as(13)pk(t)=fk∑i=0k-1[Λ(t)]ii!∑i=0l-1[Λ(t)]ii!+∑i=lu-1F¯(i)[Λ(t)]ii!.From this representation, it can be easily seen thatpk(0)=fk. Note that, ift→∞, thenΛ(t)→∞, and so we obtainlimt→∞pk(t)=1ifk=uand zero otherwise. Hence, the theorem.□Letfudenote an n-dimensional vector in which the uth element is 1 and all other elements are zero. Then, from Theorems 2.5 and 2.9, it can be concluded thatp(t), associated tofin (11), is bounded asf⩽stp(t)⩽stfufor allt⩾0.The following lemma enables us to study the monotonicity ofpk(t).Lemma 2.11Letα(.)andβ(.)be non-negative discrete functions andγbe positive and real-valued. Define(14)τ(u)=γ∑i=l′k′α(i)ui∑i=lkα(i)β(i)ui,u>0,wherel⩽l′,l′<k′andk′⩽k. Assume thatβ(.)is a non-constant decreasing (increasing) function on{l′,l′+1,…,k′}andc>0is real-valued. Then, the equationτ(u)=c(a)forc⩽γβ(l′)c⩽γβ(k′), has exactly one root ifl=l′andk′<k(k=k′andl′>l);forc>γβ(l′)c>γβ(k′), has either no positive root or exactly two positive roots, possibly being equal.We assume thatβis a decreasing function. Whenβis increasing, the proof is similar. The root of the equationτ(u)=cis readily seen to be the same as the root of the equationω(u)=0, where(15)ω(u)=c∑i=k′+1kα(i)β(i)ui+∑i=l′k′α(i)(cβ(i)-γ)ui+c∑i=ll′-1α(i)β(i)ui,where the last summation is defined to be zero ifl=l′.(a)Ifc⩽γβ(l′), thencβ(l′)-γ⩽0. By the assumptions of the theorem, at least one of the coefficients in the second summation is negative. From this fact and the fact thatcα(i)β(i)⩾0(i=l,…,k), part (a) is proved by Descartes’ rule of signs.Let us now assume thatc>γβ(l′), which immediately implies thatcβ(l′)-γ>0. Sincecβ(i)-γis decreasing in i, the change of signs of the coefficients in (15) is either+-+or all are positive. We can therefore conclude that the equationω(u)=0has either exactly two positive roots, possibly being equal, or no positive root.□Now, we can prove the following theorem.Theorem 2.12Assume thatτ(u)is as in(14), and letβ(.)be a non-constant decreasing (increasing) function on{l′,l′+1,…,k′}. Then, forl=l′andk′<k(k=k′andl′>l), we have(a)τ(u)to be upside-down bathtub-shaped with a single change-point;τ(u)to be bounded above byγ/β(k′)(γ/β(l′))We assume thatβis a decreasing function. The proof for the case whenβis increasing is similar.(a)Under the assumptions of the theorem,τ(u)is continuous on[0,∞). From part (a) of Lemma 2.11,τ(u)=γβ(l)has exactly one root, sayu∗. From the facts thatτ(u∗)>0,limu→∞τ(u)=0and thatτ(u)=c, forc<γβ(l), has also exactly one root, we can conclude thatτ(u)is strictly decreasing on[u∗,∞). Based on part (a) of Lemma 2.11, we haveτ(u)>γβ(l)for allu∈(0,u∗). Hence,τ(u)has a maximumM>γβ(l)on(0,u∗). Assume thatτ(uM)=M. Based on part (b) of Lemma 2.11, it follows thatτ(u)is strictly increasing on(0,uM)and is strictly decreasing on(uM,u∗).Consider the following polynomial:(16)h(u)≔∑i=k′+1kα(i)β(i)ui+∑i=lk′α(i)β(i)-β(k′)ui.Sinceβ(i)is decreasing in i, the coefficients in this polynomial are non-negative. Thus, by Descartes’ rule of sign, we haveh(u)⩾0for allu⩾0, which is equivalent toτ(u)⩽γβ(k′).This completes the proof of part (b), and hence the lemma.□Let the D-spectrum of the network be of the form(11). Then,(a)pl(t)is decreasing in t andpu(t)is increasing in t;pν(t)is upside-down bathtub-shaped with a single change-point;The maximum value ofpν(t)does not depend on the underlying distribution G;pν(t)is bounded above byfν/F¯(ν-1).(a)Under the assumptions of the theorem, from the representation in (8), we have(17)pk(t)=fkψ(k,t)∑i=lufiψ(i,t),whereψ(i,t)=Γ(i;Λ(t))/Γ(i),i=1,…,n. It can be shown thatΓ(i,x)/Γ(j,x), fori⩾j, is increasing in x. SinceΛ(t)is increasing, it can then be concluded thatψ(i,t)/ψ(j,t), fori⩾j, is also increasing in t. Based on this fact and the representation in (17), we observe thatpl(t)is a decreasing function of t andpu(t)is an increasing function of t. This completes the proof of part (a).In (14), letl=l′=0,k′=ν-1andk=n-1. Also, letα(i)=1/i!,β(i)=F¯(i)andγ=fν. With these, we define(18)τνp(u)≔τ(u).Upon comparingτνpin (18) with (7), we havepν(t)=τνp(Λ(t)). SinceΛ(t)is an increasing function of t, we conclude, from part (a) of Theorem 2.12, thatpν(t)is upside-down bathtub-shaped with a single change-point which is the required result.SinceΛ(t)=-logG¯(t)is increasing and takes its values on(0,∞), we havemaxt>0pν(t)=maxt>0τνp(Λ(t))=maxt>0τνp(t),as required.The result follows from part (b) of Theorem 2.12.□Consider a network with D-spectrum of the form(11). Suppose the failures of links of the network follow according to two different NHPP’s with m.v.f.’sΛi(t)=-logG¯i(t),i=1,2, respectively. Letti=argmaxt>0pνGi(t)=argmaxt>0τνp(Λi(t)),i=1,2, andargmaxt>0τνp(t)=t∗. IfH(t)is a standard exponential distribution function, thent1⩽t2if and only ifG1-1H(t∗)⩽G2-1H(t∗).From the assumptions made, it can be concluded thatΛ1(t1)=Λ2(t2)=t∗. Then,ti=Gi-1(1-e-t∗),i=1,2,which completes the proof.□InTheorem 2.14, ifG¯1(t)⩽G¯2(t), thent1⩽t2.Consider the network with 32 links, 16 nodes and four terminals presented in Fig. 2. Assume that the network fails whenever at least two terminals are disconnected. In this case, (Gertsbakh & Shpungin, 2009) estimated the corresponding D-spectrum by using Monte Carlo method, and their results are presented in Table 1.Under the assumption that the failure of the links occur according to a NHPP with m.v.f.-logG¯(t), Fig. 3presents the plot ofp14(t)whenG¯(t)is Weibull (0.8,1) with survival functionG¯1(t)=e-t0.8(fort>0), exponential with survival functionG¯2(t)=e-t(fort>0), and Weibull (2,1) with survival functionG¯3(t)=e-t2(fort>0), respectively.It can be seen numerically thatargmaxt>0τ14p(t)=t∗=9.369932051, and soH(t∗)=0.9999147508. SinceG3-1H(t∗)=3.061034437⩽G2-1H(t∗)=9.369931826⩽G1-1H(t∗)=16.39345673, it follows from Theorem 2.14 thatt3⩽t2⩽t1. It can also be concluded, from part (d) of Theorem 2.13, thatp14(t)⩽0.19983732, for allt>0.In this section, we study the inactivity time of the network when the failures of links follow a NHPP described in Section 2. The results of this section are mostly similar to some of the results derived in the preceding section. Hence, in most cases, we do not furnish the details of the proofs. If we know thatT<t, then the inactivity time of the network is defined to bet-T|(T<t). Then, from the representation in (4), we have, for allx<tandt>0,(19)P(t-T>x|T<t)=1P(T<t)∑k=1nfkP(Rk<t-x)=∑k=1nfkP(Rk<t)P(T<t)P(Rk<t-x|Rk<t)=∑k=1nqk(t)P(t-Rk>x|Rk<t),where(20)qk(t)=fkP(Rk<t)∑k=1nfkP(Rk<t),k=1,…,n.This representation is similar to the representation in (5) except that in (19) we deal with the distribution function ofRkbut in (5) the reliability function ofRkis present. Representation (19) reveals that the reliability function of the inactivity time of a network is a mixture of the reliability functions of inactivity times of the upper recordsRk,k=1,…,n, with mixing conditional D-spectrum vectorq(t)=(q1(t),…,qn(t)). As withpk(t), we can show thatqk(t)=P(T=Rk|T<t)which means thatqk(t)is the probability that the kth link causes the failure of the network, given that the network failed before time t. Moreover,qk(t)can be expressed in the form(21)qk(t)=fk∑i=kn[Λ(t)]ii!∑i=1nF(i)[Λ(t)]ii!=fkϕ(k,t)∑i=1nfiϕ(i,t),whereϕ(i,t)=γ(i;Λ(t))/Γ(i)(fori=1,…,n) andγ(k;t)=∫0txk-1e-xdxis the lower incomplete gamma function.Remark 3.1It needs to be mentioned thatq(t)is also the mixing conditional D-spectrum vector in the mixture representation for the reversed failure rate of the network. Based on Lemma 2.4, we can prove, similar to Theorem 2.5, thatq(t1)⩽stq(t2)for all0⩽t1⩽t2. Also it can be easily seen, from (21), thatqk(t)⩾qk+1(t)for allt>0if and only iffk⩾fk+1.Now, we prove the following theorem which is similar to Theorem 2.6.Theorem 3.2Letq1(t)andq2(t)be the conditional D-spectra in(19)for two networks, both of which are based on n links. Further, suppose the failures of the links follow a NHPP. Then, ifT1andT2denote the lifetimes of these two networks, we have:(a)q1(t)⩽stq2(t)implies thatt-T1|(T1<t)⩾stt-T2|(T2<t);q1(t)⩽rhq2(t)implies thatt-T1|(T1<t)⩾hrt-T2|(T2<t);q1(t)⩽lrq2(t)implies thatt-T1|(T1<t)⩾lrt-T2|(T2<t).It is easy to show thatRk⩽lrRk+1,k=1,…,n-1, for a NHPP. Then, fork=1,…,n-1, we havet-Rk|(Rk<t)⩾lrt-Rk+1|(Rk+1<t).Thus, these inactivity times are also hr- and st-ordered. Part (a) is proved by Theorem 1.A.6 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007) and the assumption thatq1(t)⩽stq2(t). Similar to part (a), parts (b) and (c) are proved by using Theorem 2.5 of Khaledi and Shaked (2010) and Theorem 1.C.17 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), respectively, and the corresponding assumptions.□Under the assumptions ofTheorem 2.8, ifG¯1(t)⩽G¯2(t)for all t, thenqG1(t)⩾stqG2(t).Letν(i)=1i!andai=fi,i=1,…,n, in Lemma 2.7. Then∑i=knqiGj(t)=ζ2k(Λj(t)),j=1,2, and hence the proof is completed by using part (b) of Lemma 2.7.□Consider the D-spectrum vector defined in(11). For anyfk>0, we havelimt→∞qk(t)=fk, andlimt→0qk(t)=1,k=l0,k≠l.The proof is similar to Theorem 2.9 and is therefore omitted.□Let the D-spectrum of the network be of the form(11). Then:(a)ql(t)is decreasing in t andqu(t)is increasing in t;qν(t)is upside-down bathtub-shaped with a single change-point;The maximum value ofqν(t)does not depend on the distribution function G;qν(t)is bounded above byfν/F(ν).(a)Under the assumptions of the theorem and (21), we can write(22)qk(t)=fkϕ(k,t)∑i=lufiϕ(i,t),whereϕ(i,t)=γ(i;Λ(t))/Γ(i)fori=1,…,n. It can be shown thatγ(i,x)/γ(j,x), fori⩾j, is increasing in x. SinceΛ(t)is increasing, we can conclude thatϕ(i,t)/ϕ(j,t), fori⩾j, is also increasing in t. Based on this fact and the representation in (22), we see thatql(t)is a decreasing function of t andqu(t)is an increasing function of t, which completes the proof of part (a).Letα(i)=1/i!,β(i)=F(i)andγ=fνin the representation in (14). By lettingk=k′=n,l=1andl′=ν, we define(23)τνq(u)≔τ(u).Upon comparing this with (21), we can conclude thatqν(t)=τνq(Λ(t)). SinceΛ(t)is an increasing function of t, we have, from part (a) of Theorem 2.12,qν(t)to be upside-down bathtub-shaped with a single change-point.Consideringτνqas in the representation (23) andqν(t)=τνq(Λ(t)), this part of the theorem can be proved in the same way as part (c) of Theorem 2.13.The result follows from part (b) of Theorem 2.12, and hence the theorem.□Analogous to Theorem 2.14 and Corollary 2.15, the following results can be established.Theorem 3.6Consider a network with D-spectrum as in(11). Let the failures of links of the network follow NHPP’s with m.v.f.’sΛi(t)=-logG¯i(t),i=1,2, respectively. Further, supposeti′=argmaxt>0qνGi(t)=argmaxt>0τνq(Λi(t))(fori=1,2) andt∗∗=argmaxt>0τνq(t). Then, we havet1′⩽t2′if and only ifG1-1H(t∗∗)⩽G2-1H(t∗∗), whereH(·)denotes the exponential distribution function.InTheorem 3.6, ifG¯1(t)⩽G¯2(t)for allt>0, thent1′⩽t2′.Consider the network in Example 2.16. Under the assumptions of the example, Fig. 4presents the plot ofq14(t)whenG¯(t)isW(0.8,1),Exp(1)orW(2,1)introduced earlier in Example 2.16. It can be numerically seen thatt∗∗=argmaxt>0τ14q(t)=15.8365103, and soH(t∗∗)=0.9999998675. SinceG3-1H(t∗∗)=3.979533037⩽G2-1H(t∗∗)=15.83668319⩽G1-1H(t∗∗)=31.59223026, we havet3′⩽t2′⩽t1′from Theorem 3.6. Also, from part (d) of Theorem 3.5, we have the upper bound asq14(t)⩽0.2774633586.In this section, we explore some results on the residual lifetime of network under some scenarios on the status of the network or the lifetimes of its links. In what follows, the D-spectrum of the network is assumed to be of the general form in (11).Consider a used network known to be working at time t, and suppose there are exactly k failed links at that time, i.e., we have{T>t}and{Rk⩽t<Rk+1}. This information on the status of the network leads to a new and useful concept termed “dynamic D-spectrum”, which is similar in principle to the ‘dynamic signature’ introduced and studied in Samaniego, Balakrishnan, and Navarro (2009). We then use the concept of dynamic D-spectrum to study the residual lifetime of the network.Theorem 4.1Consider a network consisting of n links with the D-spectrum of the form(11). Assume that the failures of links follow a NHPP with m.v.f.Λ(t)=-logG¯(t). Let T denote the lifetime of the network andRkdenote the kth record in the sequence of i.i.d. r.v.’sX1,X2,…with underlying survival functionG¯(t). WithEk={Rk⩽t<Rk+1}, fork=0,1,…,n-1, whereR0≡0, we haveP(T>t|Ek)=∑i=k+1nfi,k=0,…,n-1.Let M represent the number of failed links at the time of the failure of the network. Note thatT=RM, where M is independent ofRi’s. Hence, on noting thatM=mif and only ifT=Rm,m=1,…,n, we can writeP(T>t|Ek)=P(RM>t|Ek)=∑m=1nP(Rm>t|Ek,M=m)P(M=m)=∑m=1nfmP(Rm>t|Ek)=∑m=k+1nfm.□Suppose the links of a network fail according to the conditions of Theorem 4.1. Also, suppose the status of the network is such thatP(Ek∩{T>t})>0. Then, the “dynamic D-spectrum” of the network is an n-dimensional vectorfn(n-k)with its elements as(24)fi,n(n-k)=P(T=Ri|Ek,T>t).With this definition offn(n-k), we show that it does not depend on the underlying distribution ofXi’s.Theorem 4.3Letfn(n-k)be the “dynamic D-spectrum” of the network. Then, we have(25)fi,n(n-k)=fi∑i=k+1ufi,i=k+1,…,u0,otherwiseFrom the representation in (11), it is clear thatfi,n(n-k)=0fori≠k+1,…,u. Now, we prove the result fori=k+1,…,u. From the definition of conditional probability and the fact that{T=Ri}does not depend on the underlying distribution ofX1,X2,…, we can express(26)P(T=Ri|Ek,T>t)=P(T=Ri)P(Ek,T>t|T=Ri)P(Ek,T>t)=fiP(Ek,Ri>t)P(Ek,T>t)=fiP(Ri>t|Ek)P(T>t|Ek).On the other hand, we have(27)P(Ri>t|Ek)=1,fori=k+1,…,u.The theorem then follows from (26), (27) and Theorem 4.1.□Consider the network in Fig. 5having 10 links, five nodes and five terminals. Links are subject to failure, and the network is up if and only if all the terminals are connected to each other. It can be shown that the D-spectrum of this network is given asf=0,0,0,142,442,1242,2542,0,0,0;see (Gertsbakh & Shpungin, 2009).From Theorem 4.3, the dynamic D-spectrum of the network with exactly k=4, 5, 6 failed links at time t, respectively, are thenf10(6)=0,0,0,0,441,1241,2541,0,0,0,f10(5)=0,0,0,0,0,1237,2537,0,0,0,f10(4)=0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.In the sequel, we present a mixture representation for the survival function of the conditional r.v.T-t|(T>t,Ek), for which the following lemma will be quite useful.Lemma 4.5LetR1,R2,…be a sequence of upper records from i.i.d. non-negative r.v.’s with a common absolutely continuous distribution function G and survival functionG¯. Then,P(Ri>t+x|Rk⩽t<Rk+1)=P(Ri-k|t>x),i=k+1,k+2,…,whereRi-k|tis the(i-k)th upper record fromG¯(x|t)=G¯(x+t)G¯(t).As mentioned earlier, the occurrence time of the nth event in a NHPP{N(t),t⩾0}is distributed exactly as the nth upper record. Then, fori=k+1,k+2,…, we can express(28)P(Ri>t+x|Rk⩽t<Rk+1)=P(N(t+x)<i|N(t)=k)=P(N(t+x)<i,N(t)=k)P(N(t)=k)=P(0⩽N(t+x)-N(t)<i-k,N(t)=k)P(N(t)=k)=P(0⩽N(t+x)-N(t)<i-k)=∑j=0i-k-1[Λ(t+x)-Λ(t)]jj!e-[Λ(t+x)-Λ(t)]=P(Ri-k|t>x),where the fourth equality in (28) follows from the fact that NHPP has independent increments.□Now, we present the following main theorem.Theorem 4.6Suppose the failures of links of a network with n links follow a NHPP with m.v.f.Λ(t)=-logG¯(t). LetRkbe the kth upper record in a sequence of i.i.d. non-negative r.v.’s with underlying distribution function G, and T denote the lifetime of the network. Further, suppose we know that the network is up at time t and that exactly k links have failed by that time. Then, iffn(n-k)denotes the dynamic D-spectrum of the network as defined in(25), the reliability function of the network is(29)P(T>t+x|Ek,T>t)=∑i=1n-kfi+k,n(n-k)P(Ri|t>x),whereRi|tis the ith record fromG¯(x|t)=G¯(x+t)G¯(t).By the law of total probability, we have(30)P(T>t+x|Ek,T>t)=∑i=k+1nP(T>t+x,T=Ri|Ek,T>t)=∑i=k+1nfi,n(n-k)P(T>t+x|Ek,T>t,T=Ri).Since the events{T=Ri}and{Ri>t}are independent, we can express(31)P(T>t+x|Ek,T>t,T=Ri)=P(Ri>t+x|Ek,Ri>t,T=Ri)=P(Ri>t+x,Ek|T=Ri)P(Ri>t,Ek|T=Ri)=P(Ri>t+x,Ek)P(Ri>t,Ek)=P(Ri>t+x|Ek,Ri>t).Now, sinceP(Ek,Ri>t)=0,i=1,…,k,P(Ek),i=k+1,…,n,we see that(32)P(Ri>t+x|Ek,Ri>t)=P(Ri>t+x|Ek),i=k+1,…,n.Upon using the expressions in (30)–(32) and Lemma 4.5, we obtainP(T>t+x|Ek,T>t)=∑i=k+1nfi,n(n-k)P(Ri>t+x|Ek)=∑i=k+1nfi,n(n-k)P(Ri-k|t>x),from which the required result follows by a change of variable.□Let us now assume thatG¯(x)=e-λx,x>0. Then, due to the lack of memory property of the exponential distribution, it is known thatRi|t=dRi(i=1,…,n-k)(see (Arnold et al., 1998)), and henceP(T>t+x|Ek,T>t)=∑i=1n-kfi+k,n(n-k)Γ(i;λx)Γ(i).In Example 4.4, suppose the m.v.f. of NHPP isΛ(t)=λt. Then, corresponding tok=4,5and 6, we obtainP(T>t+x|E4,T>t)=441Γ(1;λx)+1241Γ(2;λx)+2582Γ(3;λx),P(T>t+x|E5,T>t)=1237Γ(1;λx)+2537Γ(2;λx),P(T>t+x|E6,T>t)=Γ(1;λx)=e-λx.The preservation theorem below links the characteristics of the D-spectrum of the network with the network performance. For this purpose, let us define an(n-k)-dimensional vectorfn∗(n-k)by(33)fn∗(n-k)=(fk+1,n(n-k),…,fn,n(n-k)),which is actually the dynamic D-spectrum vector of the network wherein the initial zeros are deleted.Consider two working but used networks with exactlyk1andk2links failed by time t. Without loss of generality, let us supposek1⩽k2. Supposef1,n(n-k1)andf2,n(n-k2)denote, respectively, the corresponding dynamic D-spectrum vectors of the two networks. Define(34)f1,n∗(n-kmin)=f1,n∗(n-k1),f2,n∗(n-kmin)=(f2,n∗(n-k2),0,…,0︷k2-k1times).Then, the following theorem establishes some stochastic ordering results between these two networks.Theorem 4.9Consider two networks with lifetimesT1andT2, both based on n links. Suppose both networks are up at time t and have exactlyk1andk2links failed by time t, respectively. Letf1,n(n-k1)andf2,n(n-k2)be the corresponding dynamic D-spectra of the two networks, as defined inTheorem 4.3. If the failures of links follow a NHPP, then(a)f1,n∗(n-kmin)⩽stf2,n∗(n-kmin)implies thatT1-t|(T1>t,Ek1)⩽stT2-t|(T2>t,Ek2);f1,n∗(n-kmin)⩽hrf2,n∗(n-kmin)implies thatT1-t|(T1>t,Ek1)⩽hrT2-t|(T2>t,Ek2);f1,n∗(n-kmin)⩽lrf2,n∗(n-kmin)implies thatT1-t|(T1>t,Ek1)⩽lrT2-t|(T2>t,Ek2).From the definition offn∗(n-kmin), the reliability function of the network in (29) can be expressed as(35)P(Tl>t+x|Ekl,Tl>t)=∑i=1n-min{k1,k2}fl,i+kl,n∗(n-kmin)P(Ri|t>x),l=1,2.SinceRi|t(i=1,…,n-min{k1,k2}) is the ith upper record from a population with survival functionG¯(x|t)=G¯(x+t)G¯(t), it can be easily seen thatRi|t⩽lrRi+1|t. The required ordering results then follow upon using this fact in the mixture representation in (35), and then proceeding as in the case of Theorem 2.6.□Let T denote the lifetime of a network with n links for which the corresponding D-spectrum has the property thatfk/F¯(k)is increasing ink,k=0,…,n-1. Assume that the failures of links follow a NHPP. If we know that the network is up at time t with exactly k failed links, then the reliability of the residual lifetime of the network, i.e.,P(T>t+x|Ek,T>t), is decreasing in k.Iffk/F¯(k)is increasing in k, fork1⩽k2, we have(fn∗(n-k2),0,…,0︷k2-k1times)⩽stfn∗(n-k1).Then, from part (a) of Theorem 4.9, we readily conclude thatT-t|(T>t,Ek2)⩽stT-t|(T>t,Ek1),as required.□Consider the network in Example 4.4. Corresponding tok=4,5,6, we obtainf10∗(6)=441,1241,2541,0,0,0,f10∗(5)=1237,2537,0,0,0,f10∗(4)=1,0,0,0.We then observe that(f10∗(4),0,0)⩽st(f10∗(5),0)⩽stf10∗(6). Fig. 6presents the plot of the reliability of the residual lifetime of the network whenG¯(x)=e-x,x>0.In this section, we study the residual lifetime of a network after the failure of the kth link, i.e.,{T-Rk|T>Rk}. In this case, the dynamic D-spectrum is a vector whose elements are given byP(T=Ri|T>Rk),i=1,…,n. Let the D-spectrum of the network be of the form (11). Then, we can easily show that(36)P(T=Ri|T>Rk)=fi∑i=k+1ufi,i=k+1,…,u,0,otherwise.It can be seen that the dynamic D-spectrum in (36) is same as the dynamic D-spectrum defined in the representation (25). For this reason, we adopt the same notation for the dynamic D-spectrum vector throughout this subsection.Theorem 4.12Let T denote the lifetime of a network with n links. Assume that the failures of links follow a NHPP with m.v.f.Λ(t)=-logG¯(t). LetRkbe the kth upper record in the sequence of i.i.d. non-negative r.v.’sX1,X2,…with underlying distribution function G. If we know that k links have failed already, then the residual lifetime of the network has its reliability asP(T-Rk>x|T>Rk)=∑i=1n-kfi+k,n(n-k)P(Ri+k-Rk>x).By the law of total probability and the independence of{T=Ri}and{Ri-Rk>x}, we obtain the required result.□It is well-known that successive spacings between records from an exponential distribution with survival functionG¯(x)=e-λxare i.i.d. with distribution G (see, e.g. (Arnold et al., 1998)). So,Ri-Rjhas a gamma distribution with shape parameteri-jand scale parameterλ. We can use this fact to obtain a simplified expression for the reliability function of the residual lifetime of the network in this case as follows.Remark 4.13If the failures of links of the network follow a NHPP with m.v.f.Λ(t)=λt,λ>0, thenP(T-Rk>x|T>Rk)=∑i=1n-kfi+k,n(n-k)Γ(i;λx)Γ(i).This is, in fact, the reliability function in Corollary 4.7. Then in this case,(T-Rk|T>Rk)=d(T-t|Ek,T>t).From the mixture representation of the network reliability in Theorem 4.12 and the preservation theorems presented in Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007), the following theorem readily follows.Theorem 4.14Consider two networks with lifetimesT1andT2, both based on n links. Assume that we know k links of each network have failed already. Letf1,n(n-k)andf2,n(n-k)be the corresponding dynamic D-spectra of the two networks. If the failures of links follow a NHPP, then(a)f1,n(n-k)⩽stf2,n(n-k)implies thatT1-Rk|(T1>Rk)⩽stT2-Rk|(T2>Rk);f1,n(n-k)⩽hr(lr)f2,n(n-k)andRi-Rk⩽hr(lr)Ri+1-Rk(i=k+1,…,n-1) implies thatT1-Rk|(T1>Rk)⩽hr(lr)T2-Rk|(T2>Rk).Under the conditions ofTheorem 4.14, suppose we know thatk1andk2links of the two networks have failed. Letf1,n∗(n-kmin)andf2,n∗(n-kmin)denote the corresponding vectors, as defined in(34), for the two networks. Iff1,n∗(n-kmin)⩽stf2,n∗(n-kmin), thenT1-Rk1|(T1>Rk1)⩽stT2-Rk2|(T2>Rk2).Using the definition offn∗(n-kmin)in (34), we may rewrite the reliability in Theorem 4.12 as(37)P(T-Rkl>x|T>Rkl)=∑i=1n-min{k1,k2}fl,i+kl,n∗(n-kmin)P(Ri+kl-Rkl>x),l=1,2.Next, from the definition of upper record values, we haveP(Ri+kl-Rkl⩽Ri+kl+1-Rkl)=1(l=1,2), and soRi+kl-Rkl⩽stRi+kl+1-Rkl. Thus, the required result is obtained from Theorem 1.A.6 of Shaked and Shanthikumar (2007).□

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In the present work, we have considered a two-state (up and down) network consisting of n links. We have investigated the D-spectrum based dynamic reliability of the network under the assumption that the links are subject to failure according to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Under the assumption that the network is operating (has failed) at time t, we have obtained a mixture representation for the reliability of residual lifetime (inactivity time) of the network in terms of the reliability of residual lifetime (inactivity time) of upper record values. Using these representations, and based on the concept of conditional D-spectra defined here, several stochastic ordering results on the reliability of residual lifetime (inactivity time) of the network have been established. We have also studied the residual lifetime of the network under the condition that the network is working at time t with exactly k failed links at that time. The reliability of the residual lifetime of the network after the failure of the kth link in the network has been studied which resulted in the definition of a new concept called dynamic D-spectrum. To illustrate the importance of the results, various examples and graphs have also been provided. We should remark on some points here. Although, in this study, we have assumed that the links of the network are subject to failure, the results continue to hold if one assumes that the nodes of the network are subject to failure. Throughout the paper, it has been assumed that only one link fails at each time. However, a more general case, which would be of interest and can be considered for a future study, is to assume that more than one link can fail simultaneously at each time. As a final remark, we have to point out that the results continue to hold if one considers any system that stops after K events, where K has probability mass functionf=(f1,f2,…,fn), instead of a network.
