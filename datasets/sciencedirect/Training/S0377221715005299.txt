In a recently published paper by Liu et al. [Liu, F., Zhang, W.G., Wang, Z.X. (2012). A goal programming model for incomplete interval multiplicative preference relations and its application in group decision-making. European Journal of Operational Research 218, 747–754], two equations are introduced to define consistency of incomplete interval multiplicative preference relations (IMPRs) and employed to develop a goal programming model for estimating missing values. This note illustrates that such consistency definition and estimation model are technically incorrect. New transitivity conditions are proposed to define consistent IMPRs, and a two-stage goal programming approach is devised to estimate missing values for incomplete IMPRs.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The interval multiplicative preference relation (IMPR) introduced by Saaty and Vargas (1987) is a powerful and efficient tool for expressing decision-makers’ (DMs’) pairwise judgments with uncertainty, and has been used to model uncertainty in multi-criteria decision analysis (Durbach & Stewart, 2012). On the other hand, because of complexity of decision problems and the limited ability of human pairwise comparisons, DMs may be unable to provide their preferences over some pairs of decision alternatives. As such, incomplete judgments are resulted and decision making problems with incomplete preference relations have been received more and more attention in recent years (Mattila & Virtanen, 2015; Punkka & Salo, 2013; Wang & Li, 2015). The consistency of preference relations is a crucial foundation for estimating missing values and obtaining a reasonable and reliable decision result (Brunelli, Canal, & Fedrizzi, 2013; Brunelli & Fedrizzi, 2015; Kou, Ergu, & Shang, 2014). In order to characterize inconsistency indices for pairwise comparison matrices, Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2014) put forward five axioms. One of them is the invariance with respect to permutations of decision alternatives.In a recent paper, Liu et al. (2012) introduced two equations to define consistency of incomplete IMPRs, and developed a goal programming model to estimate missing values. However, a close investigation demonstrates that such consistency definition is highly dependent on alternative labels and not robust to permutations of decision alternatives, and the goal programming model suffers from serious drawbacks. The aim of this note is to point out and correct errors in the consistency definition and the goal programming model.At first, the terminology and notation used are mainly introduced as follows.LetX={x1,x2,…,xn}be a finite set of n alternatives, an IMPRA¯on X is characterized by an interval judgment matrixA¯=(a¯ij)n×n=([aij−,aij+])n×nwith(1.1)1/S≤aij−≤aij+≤S,aij−aji+=1,aii−=aii+=1,i,j=1,2,…,nwherea¯ijis an interval judgment selected in a bounded scale [1/S, S], and indicates that xiis betweenaij−andaij+times preferred than xj.The pairwise judgments are usually expressed on the 1-9 Saaty's scale, i.e.S=9. If some judgments inA¯are missing, thenA¯is referred to as an incomplete IMPR. Obviously, the missing values may be lower or/and upper bounds of interval judgments.Liu et al. (2012) employed two formulae (see Liu et al. (2012), Eq. (6) on page 748) to construct two multiplicative preference relationsC=(cij)n×nandD=(dij)n×nfrom an IMPRA¯=(a¯ij)n×n=([aij−,aij+])n×n. The formulae can be rewritten as follows by using the notation in this note(2.1)cij={aij+i<j1i=jaij−i>jdij={aij−i<j1i=jaij+i>jWhenA¯is an incomplete IMPR, C and D constructed fromA¯by using (2.1) may be two incomplete comparison matrices. Based on (2.1), Liu et al. (2012) proposed the consistency definition for incomplete IMPRs (see Liu et al. (2012), Definition 7 on page 749) as follows:Definition 2.1(Liu et al., 2012). LetA¯=(a¯ij)n×n=([aij−,aij+])n×nbe an incomplete IMPR.A¯is called consistent, if all the known elements of C and D defined by (2.1) satisfy the following condition:(2.2)cij=cikckj,dij=dikdkji,j,k=1,2,…,nNext, an example is provided to illustrate that such consistency definition is technically wrong.Example 1Consider a decision making problem with four alternatives. LetX={x1,x2,x3,x4}be a set of the alternatives. After comparing pairs of the alternatives, a DM furnishes an incomplete IMPR as follows:A¯1=(a¯ij)4×4=([aij−,aij+])4×4=x1x2x3x4[[1,1][2,3][3,6][1,3][1/3,1/2][1,1][3/2,2]−[1/6,1/3][1/2,2/3][1,1][1/3,1/2][1/3,1]−[2,3][1,1]]x1x2x3x4As per (2.1), the two incomplete multiplicative preference relations are determined asC1=(cij)4×4=x1x2x3x4[13631/312−1/61/211/21/3−21]x1x2x3x4D1=(dij)4×4=x1x2x3x4[12311/213/2−1/32/311/31−31]x1x2x3x4One can easily verify that C1 and D1 satisfy (2.2). According to Definition 2.1,A¯1is a consistent and incomplete IMPR.Let σ be a permutation of {1, 2, 3, 4} satisfyingσ(1)=1,σ(2)=4,σ(3)=3,σ(4)=2, then we have the following incomplete IMPR.A¯′1=(a¯′ij)4×4=([aij′−,aij′+])4×4=([aσ(i)σ(j)−,aσ(i)σ(j)+])4×4=x1x4x3x2[[1,1][1,3][3,6][2,3][1/3,1][1,1][2,3]−[1/6,1/3][1/3,1/2][1,1][1/2,2/3][1/3,1/2]−[3/2,2][1,1]]x1x4x3x2Similarly, by (2.1), the two incomplete multiplicative preference relations C'1and D'1 are obtained as:C1′=(c′ij)4×4=x1x4x3x2[13631/313−1/61/312/31/3−3/21]x1x4x3x2D1′=(d′ij)4×4=x1x4x3x2[1132112−1/31/211/21/2−21]x1x4x3x2Asc13′=6≠9=3×3=c12′c23′andd13′=3≠2=1×2=d12′d23′, C'1 and D'1 do not satisfy (2.2). By Definition 2.1,A¯1′is an inconsistent and incomplete IMPR.Example 1 clearly indicates that, for the identical judgment information with different labeling for alternatives, Definition 2.1 yields contradictory results. In other words, Definition 2.1 is not robust to permutations of decision alternatives. From the viewpoint of the pairwise comparison, the consistency of preference relations should be independent of alternative labels such that it has the invariance with respect to permutations of decision alternatives. Therefore, Definition 2.1 by Liu et al. (2012) is technically incorrect.In addition, incomplete IMPRs with extremely inconsistent judgments may be determined as consistent IMPRs as per Definition 2.1. Moreover, incorrect results may be obtained when the matrices Cand D defined by (2.1) are used to check acceptability and estimate missing values for incomplete IMPRs.Example 2Consider the following two incomplete IMPRs:A¯2=([aij−,aij+])3×3=[[1,1][9,9][−,1/7][1/9,1/9][1,1][8,−][7,−][−,1/8][1,1]]A¯3=([aij−,aij+])3×3=[[1,1][2,2][−,1/4][1/2,1/2][1,1][3,−][4,−][−,1/3][1,1]]ForA¯2, the given judgmenta12=[9,9]indicates that x1 is 9 times preferred than x2, and the interval judgmenta23=[8,−]denotes that x2 is at least 8 times preferred than x3, whereas, the interval judgmenta31=[7,−]gives that x3 is at least 7 times preferred than x1. Therefore, the judgments inA¯2are extremely inconsistent. However, by Definition 2.1, one can easily obtain thatA¯2is a consistent IMPR. Obviously, this result is highly questionable.ForA¯3, as per (2.1), the two incomplete comparison matrices are determined asC3=[121/41/21−4−1]D3=[12−1/213−1/31]As per Definition 2.1, the incomplete IMPRA¯3is consistent. By using (2.2), the obtained estimation values arec23=1/8andd13=6, i.e.,a23+=1/8anda13−=6. However, by observing the lower bound of the interval judgmenta¯23=[3,−]in the given IMPRA¯3, any possible valuea23+should be more than or equal to 3. Similarly,a13−should be less than or equal to 1/4. Clearly, the results obtained by (2.2) are incorrect.As per the concept of acceptable IMPRs by Liu et al. (2012) (see Definition 8 on page 749), one can obtain thatA¯2is unacceptable andA¯3is acceptable, implying that a consistent IMPR may be unacceptable and an acceptably incomplete IMPR may not be complemented. Therefore, the acceptability definition by Liu et al. (2012) suffers from serious defects and its applications should be very cautious.Based on (2.2), Liu et al. (2012) put forward the following model (see Liu et al. (2012), (LOP2) on page 749) to estimate missing values for incomplete IMPRs whose judgments are given by the DM under the 1-9 Saaty's scale.(2.3)minJ=∑i=1n∑j=1n∑k=1n(vijkc++vijkc−+vijkd++vijkd−)s.t.{log9cij−(log9cik+log9ckj)−vijkc++vijkc−=0,log9dij−(log9dik+log9dkj)−vijkd++vijkd−=0,cij≥dij,i<jcij≤dij,i>j1/9≤cij≤9,1/9≤dij≤9vijkc−≥0,vijkc+≥0,vijkc−≥0,vijkd−≥0,vijkd+≥0,i,j,k=1,2,…,n,i≠j≠k.wherevijkc−,vijkc+,vijkc−andvijkd+are deviation variables, and if cijor dijis unknown, then it is a decision variable.Obviously, (2.3) does not consider the multiplicative reciprocal property ofcijcji=1,dijdji=1,i,j=1,2,…,n.By substituting the incomplete IMPRA¯1in Example 1 into (2.3), and solving this model, we obtain the optimal solutions asc24*=1,d24*=0.5,c42*=1,d42*=2. Thus, one has the complemented valuesa¯24=[a24−,a24+]=[0.5,1]anda¯42=[a42−,a42+]=[1,2].Similarly, by (2.3), forA¯1′in Example 1, one gets the optimal solutions asc24′*=1.9057,d24′*=1.9057,c42′*=0.5247,d42′*=0.5247. Then, we have the complemented valuesa¯24′=[a24′−,a24′+]=[1.9057,1.9057]anda¯42′=[a42′−,a42′+]=[0.5247,0.5247].It is obvious thata¯24≠a¯42′anda¯42≠a¯24′. However, from the viewpoint of the pairwise comparison,a¯24is the interval ratio of the alternative x2 over x4, anda¯42′is also the interval ratio of x2 over x4. Thus, inconsistent results are obtained from the same judgment information by applying (2.3). The computation results demonstrate that the model (2.3) depends on alternative labels and is not robust to permutations of decision alternatives. Therefore, the goal programming model proposed by Liu et al. (2012) is also technically incorrect.This section introduces new transitivity conditions and develops a two-stage goal programming approach to correct the errors in Liu et al. (2012).Definition 3.1LetA¯=(a¯ij)n×n=([aij−,aij+])n×nbe a complete IMPR.A¯is called (geometrically) consistent, if it satisfies the following transitivity condition:(3.1)aij−aij+=aik−aik+akj−akj+,i,j,k=1,2,…,nIt is obvious that Definition 3.1 is independent of alternative labels. Moreover, (3.1) is equivalent toaij−aij+=aik−aik+akj−akj+,i,j,k=1,2,…,n. It is easy to prove thatA¯is consistent if and only if the multiplicative reciprocal crisp matrixA=(aij−aij+)n×nhas Saaty's consistency. Thus, the inconsistency level of the IMPRA¯can be measured by using Saaty's consistency index (CI) of the A.As per (1.1), (3.1) can be equivalently expressed as any of the following equations:(3.2)aij−ajk−aki−=aik−akj−aji−,i,j,k=1,2,…,n(3.3)aij+ajk+aki+=aik+akj+aji+,i,j,k=1,2,…,nAccording to interval arithmetic, it follows from (3.2) and (3.3) that (3.1) can be also equivalently denoted as(3.4)a¯ij⊗a¯jk⊗a¯ki=a¯ik⊗a¯kj⊗a¯ji,i,j,k=1,2,…,nwhere ⊗ indicates the interval multiplication operation.Therefore, the following theorem can be directly obtained.Theorem 3.1For a complete IMPRA¯=(a¯ij)n×n=([aij−,aij+])n×n, the following statements are equivalent:(i)A¯is consistent (underDefinition 3.1);aij−ajk−aki−=aik−akj−aji−,i,j,k=1,2,…,n;aij+ajk+aki+=aik+akj+aji+,i,j,k=1,2,…,n;a¯ij⊗a¯jk⊗a¯ki=a¯ik⊗a¯kj⊗a¯ji,i,j,k=1,2,…,n.Theorem 3.2LetA¯=(a¯ij)n×n=([aij−,aij+])n×nbe a complete IMPR. If all elements of C and D defined by(2.1)satisfy(2.2), thenA¯is consistent (underDefinition 3.1).ProofFor alli,j,k=1,2,…,n, there are six possible cases:(1)i < j < k. By (2.1) and (2.2), we haveaik+=aij+ajk+andaik−=aij−ajk−. It follows from the reciprocal property of IMPRs thataik+=aij+ajk+⇒1aki−=1aji−akj−⇒aki−=aji−akj−. Thus, one can obtainaij−ajk−aki−=aik−akj−aji−.i < k < j. As per (2.1) and (2.2), one hasaij+=aik+akj+andaij−=aik−akj−. It follows thataij+=aik+akj+⇒1aji−=1aki−ajk−⇒aji−=aki−ajk−⇒aij−ajk−aki−=aik−akj−aji−.Similarly, by changing the order of the indices i, j, k, one can obtain thataij−ajk−aki−=aik−akj−aji−holds for the remaining four situations: (3) j < i < k, (4) j < k < i, (5) k < i < j and (6) k < j < i. By Theorem 3.1,A¯is consistent.□Theorem 3.2 indicates that if a complete IMPRA¯satisfies (2.2), then it is consistent. Conversely, however, ifA¯is consistent (under Definition 3.1), it does not necessarily satisfy (2.2). Moreover, one can verify that the matrices C and D constructed fromA¯by using (2.1) depends on alternative labels and are not robust to permutations of decision alternatives. Therefore, it is unreasonable to employ (2.2) to define consistency of complete IMPRs.As per (1.1), any of the equations of the statements (ii)–(iv) in Theorem 3.1 holds true for IMPRs if two of the indices i, j, k are equal, or the three of them. Let(3.5)KA¯L={(i,j)|i≠j,aij−inA¯isknown}Then, based on Theorem 3.1, the consistency of incomplete IMPRs can be defined as follows.Definition 3.2LetA¯=(a¯ij)n×n=([aij−,aij+])n×nbe an incomplete IMPR.A¯is called consistent, if there existsa^ij−for alli,j=1,2,…,nsuch that(3.6)a^ij−a^jk−a^ki−=a^ik−a^kj−a^ji−,i,j,k=1,2,…,n(3.7)a^ij−L≤a^ij−≤a^ij−U,i,j=1,2,…,n(3.8)a^ij−≤1/a^ji−,i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j,(i,j)∉KA¯L,(j,i)∉KA¯LObviously, Definition 3.2 is independent of alternative labels. One can easily verify thatA¯1andA¯1′in Example 1 are both consistent, andA¯2andA¯3in Example 2 are inconsistent under Definition 3.2.If DMs employ the 1–9 Saaty's scale to provide their judgments, then (3.2) can be equivalently rewritten as(3.10)log9aij−+log9ajk−+log9aki−=log9aik−+log9akj−+log9aji−,i,j,k=1,2,…,nEq. (3.10) holds for consistent IMPRs. If an IMPR is inconsistent, then it cannot be expressed as (3.10). To estimate missing values of the incomplete IMPRA¯, we will have to relax the relation in (3.10) by allowing some deviations for(i,j)∈UKA¯Landk=1,2,…,n,k≠i,k≠j, where(3.11)UKA¯L={(i,j)|i,j=1,2,…,n,i≠j}−KA¯LConsequently, the following multi-objective programming model is established:(3.12)minJij=∑k=1,k≠i,k≠j.n|log9aij−+log9ajk−+log9aki−−(log9aik−+log9akj−+log9aji−)|(i,j)∈UKA¯Ls.t.1/9≤aij−≤9,aij−aji−≤1,(1/aji−)/aij−≤p,(i,j)∈UKA¯Lwhere p(1 ≤ p ≤ 81) is a parameter that is expected to control the uncertainty level of the complemented interval judgments, the first constraint ensures that the complemented values are based on the 1–9 Saaty's scale, the next constraint guarantees that the complemented valueaij−combined with1/aji−constitutes an interval judgment[aij−,1/aji−], i.e.,aij−≤(1/aji−), the last constraint requires that the uncertainty level (or ratio) of the complemented interval judgment[aij−,1/aji−]is smaller than or equal to p, andaij−(for(i,j)∈UKA¯L) are decision variables.It is noted that the parameter p controls the tradeoff between the uncertainty level and the consistency of the complemented IMPR. The smaller the p value, the less uncertainty the complemented judgments have. If p = 1, then the complemented interval judgments collapse into single points and have no uncertainty.Let(3.13)ɛijk=log9aij−+log9ajk−+log9aki−−(log9aik−+log9akj−+log9aji−),ɛijk+=|ɛijk|+ɛijk2,ɛijk−=|ɛijk|−ɛijk2for all(i,j)∈UKA¯Landk=1,2,…,n,k≠i,k≠j. Then, one can obtainɛijk=ɛijk+−ɛijk−,|ɛijk|=ɛijk++ɛijk−andɛijk+ɛijk−=0. Therefore, the solution to the minimization problem (3.12) can be found by solving the following goal programming model:(3.14)minJ=∑(i,j)∈UKA¯L∑k=1,k≠i,k≠j.n(ɛijk++ɛijk−)s.t{log9aij−+log9ajk−+log9aki−−(log9aik−(i,j)∈UKA¯L,+log9akj−+log9aji−)−ɛijk++ɛijk−=0,k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠j1/9≤aij−≤9,1/p≤aij−aji−≤1,(i,j)∈UKA¯Lɛijk+≥0,ɛijk−≥0.(i,j)∈UKA¯L,k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠j.One can easily verify thattij−(for(i,j)∈UKA¯L) are feasible solutions to (3.14) under any p value (1 ≤ p ≤ 81), where(3.15)tij−={1/aji−(i,j)∈UKA¯L,(j,i)∉UKA¯L1(i,j)∈UKA¯L,(j,i)∈UKA¯LMoreover, multiple solutions of (3.14) may be found for a given p value. Since the missing judgments are inherently uncertain, it is sensible to expect that such uncertainty is properly captured and maximized by the complemented judgments. For an interval judgment[aij−,1/aji−], its uncertainty ratio can be measured by1/(aij−aji−). Thus, we establish the following goal programming model to find a benchmark among the optimal solutions of (3.14).(3.16)maxJ˜=∑(i,j)∈UKA¯L(1aij−aji−)s.t.{log9aij−+log9ajk−+log9aki−−(log9aik−(i,j)∈UKA¯L,+log9akj−+log9aji−)−ɛijk++ɛijk−=0,k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠j1/9≤aij−≤9,1/p≤aij−aji−≤1,(i,j)∈UKA¯Lɛijk+≥0,ɛijk−≥0,(i,j)∈UKA¯L,∑(i,j)∈UKA¯L∑k=1,k≠i,k≠j.n(ɛijk++ɛijk−)=J*.k=1,2,….n,k≠i,k≠jwhere J* is the optimal objective function value of (3.14).Solving (3.16) yields optimal solutionsaij−*(for(i,j)∈UKA¯L). Thus, the complete IMPR is determined asA¯c=(a¯ijc)n×n=([aij−c,aij+c])n×n, where(3.17)aij−c={aij−(i,j)∉UKA¯L1i=jaij−*(i,j)∈UKA¯Laij+c={aij+(j,i)∉UKA¯L1i=j1/aji−*(j,i)∈UKA¯LTheorem 3.3LetA¯=(a¯ij)n×n=([aij−,aij+])n×nbe an incomplete IMPR, σ be a permutation of{1,2,…,n}andA¯′=([aij′−,aij′+])n×n=([aσ(i)σ(j)−,aσ(i)σ(j)+])n×n. Ifaij−*(for(i,j)∈UKA¯L) are the optimal solutions to(3.16)atp=p0forA¯, thenaij′−*=aσ(i)σ(j)−*(for(i,j)∈UKA¯′L) are the optimal solutions to(3.16)atp=p0forA¯′.Theorem 3.3 indicates that the model (3.16) is independent of alternative labels. One can easily verify that (3.16) yields the identical interval judgments under the same parameter values for incomplete IMPRsA¯1andA¯1′in Example 1.Based onA¯1in Example 1, by (3.14), (3.16) and (3.17), one can obtain the complemented interval judgments[a24−c,a24+c]and[a42−c,a42+c]under different parameter p values as shown in Table 1.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This note has shown that the consistency definition and the goal programming model proposed by Liu et al. (2012) are technically wrong. New transitivity conditions have been put forward to correct the errors, and a two-stage goal programming approach with an uncertainty level controlling parameter has been developed to estimate missing values for incomplete IMPRs.
