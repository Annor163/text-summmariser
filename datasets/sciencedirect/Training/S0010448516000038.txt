@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In order to extract a construction tree from a finite set of points sampled on the surface of an object, we present an evolutionary algorithm that evolves set-theoretic expressions made of primitives fitted to the input point-set and modeling operations. To keep relatively simple trees, we use a penalty term in the objective function optimized by the evolutionary algorithm. We show with experiments successes but also limitations of this approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Reverse engineering can be considered as a process of reconstruction from scanned point clouds of geometric models suitable for further re-use and modifications. These modifications can be performed on different levels. The lowest level allows for tweaking of the polygonal mesh vertices or control points of parametric surfaces. To support a higher level of interaction with reconstructed objects, obtained models have to be parameterized such that the user could modify individual parts and the entire logic of the object construction including its topology. Such a parameterized model reconstruction is required in mechanical engineering, bio-engineering, computer animation and other application areas  [1].Parametric solid models usually consist of geometric features composed using surface patches and a design history tree (or a feature tree) that represents the design intent and the sequence of operations for making a particular model. It is expected that a modification of any parameter has to be propagated through the entire model and it is automatically rebuilt accordingly. The feature recognition is a reverse engineering approach to generating feature-based parametric solids with the feature tree defining the model rebuilding procedure  [2]. In practice, the rebuilding procedure using the feature tree can fail or result in an invalid object for some parameter modifications, which is a known problem of parametric solid modeling.An alternative approach to creating parameterized models is constructive solid modeling based on the Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)  [3] or the Function Representation (FRep)  [4]. A constructive model is represented by a binary (CSG) or n-ary (FRep) construction tree structure with primitive solids at the leaves and operations at the internal nodes of the tree. For any given point in space, an evaluation procedure traverses the tree and evaluates a binary point membership predicate (CSG) or a value of a real function (FRep) at this point. Such a model can be fully parameterized and any changes to the parameters are taken into account during the next evaluation inquiry without failure. Although an empty set can be generated as a result of parameter modifications, it is still a valid model.We are interested in a reverse engineering procedure that can extract a construction FRep tree from a given input point cloud. The point-cloud is first segmented and primitives from a set of templates are fitted to each subset. A tree structure involving the fitted primitives and modeling operations is then discovered. The tree extraction is a complex optimization problem. We employ an evolutionary approach to solve it. Although evolutionary techniques have been already used for data fitting, geometric shapes generation and optimization  [5], extraction of a construction tree is a new application area for genetic algorithms and genetic programming.Contributions. In this work we present an algorithm to:•segment an input point-set in several subsets and fit primitives to each of them;combine these fitted primitives by modeling operations in order to obtain a constructive model for the input point-set;limit the size of the evolved construction tree to allow its reusability.
