@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The increasing availability of distributed renewable energy sources such as photo-voltaic (PV) panels has introduced new requirements for innovative power grid infrastructures. Information technologies provide new opportunities for developing techniques to optimize the energy usage by a new generation of smart-grids. Here we investigate an original solution that aims at maximizing the self-consumption within a neighborhood based on a collaborative approach. Distributed software agents plan and enforce the optimal schedule of consuming appliances according to the prediction of energy production by PV panels, the estimated energy profile of consuming devices and the user's preferences and constraints. Finally we focus on the performance evaluation of a negotiation protocol that allows agents to find a sub-optimal solution for the global schedule, comparing results obtained by a prototype implementation and experimenting different technologies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A smart grid is a modernized electrical grid that uses information and communications technology to optimize the utilization of infrastructures and energy management. The main goal is gathering and acting on information, about the behaviors of suppliers and consumers, in an automated fashion to improve the efficiency, reliability, economics, and sustainability of the production and distribution of electricity [1].Among the new requirements for such a smart capability there is the need to integrate decentralized renewable sources (DER), which have recently changed both demand and availability of energy. Above all it is relevant to address the amount of energy produced by photo-voltaic (PV) panels because of the irregular power profile, which is not aligned with the consumptions, and because of the growing number of installation by private users, companies, public bodies and resellers.PV panels turn periodically consumers into distributed producers, when they are not able to consume what they produce. Unfortunately the cost of big energy storages is still not affordable for private users.The lack of alignment between production and consumption causes peeks of energy transfers which need to be managed by over dimensioning the grid infrastructure. Another issue is the loss of energy that occurs during transfers when it is not consumed locally. Finally there is not an open market or any regulation that allows users to sell their over-production at a convenient rate.According to NIST [2] there is an urgent need to establish protocols and standards for the Smart Grid. Without standards, there is the potential for technologies developed or implemented with sizable public and private investments to become obsolete prematurely or to be implemented without measures necessary to ensure security.The CoSSMic project11http://www.cossmic.eu.investigates regulatory, organizational and technical challenges about the transition from centralized power network to distributes Smart Solar powered Micro Grids operating in deregulated energy markets, where users can negotiate and exchange energy to achieve an individual and a global benefit.Here we define a micro-grid as a neighborhood of users which are available to share their infrastructures and the energy produced by their PV panels according to a collaborative approach. They collaborate to optimize the self-consumption of their neighborhood and get a reward according to their participation and to the produced economy.In our scope CoSSMic will implement an autonomic platform that executes a collaborative strategy on users' behalf according to their preference and constraints.To achieve such goal it is necessary that autonomous and distributed applications are able to interact to exchange data about the energy profiles of consuming appliances, energy storages, prediction of production, monitoring information and control messages with an increasing number of users, applications, services and information sources.In the CoSSMic scenario software agents manage user's devices behaving as consumers and producers. They monitor in real time energy utilization, learn energy profiles of devices and use user's constraints and predictions to compute a global schedule for the consuming appliances.Such a distributed scheduling is computed by a negotiation between consumer and producer agents. A sub-optimal solution will be searched to address the complexity of the problem. Consumer agents broker the best producer and negotiate by exchanging an SLA template.Here we focus on the negotiation protocol and investigate its scalability using different technologies and comparing experimental results obtained running a prototype implementation under different condition.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains the related works; Section 3 describes the CoSSMic project; in Section 4 the problem is formulated as a scheduling problem; in Section 5 negotiation phase and SLA requirements are presented; the prototype we developed is presented in Section 6; Section 7 describes the experiments and presents the results; finally in Section 8 conclusions are reported.
