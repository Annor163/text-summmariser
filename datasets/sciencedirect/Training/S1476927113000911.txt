@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Exposure-response modeling and simulation is especially useful in oncology as it permits to predict and design un-experimented clinical trials as well as dose selection. Dendritic cells (DC) are the most effective immune cells in the regulation of immune system. To activate immune system, DCs may be matured by many factors like bacterial CpG-DNA, Lipopolysaccharaide (LPS) and other microbial products.In this paper, a model based on artificial neural network (ANN) is presented for analyzing the dynamics of antitumor vaccines using empirical data obtained from the experimentations of different groups of mice treated with DCs matured by bacterial CpG-DNA, LPS and whole lysate of a Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. Also, tumor lysate was added to DCs followed by addition of maturation factors. Simulations show that the proposed model can interpret the important features of empirical data. Owing to the nonlinearity properties, the proposed ANN model has been able not only to describe the contradictory empirical results, but also to predict new vaccination patterns for controlling the tumor growth. For example, the proposed model predicts an exponentially increasing pattern of CpG-matured DC to be effective in suppressing the tumor growth.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
To understand and predict the pharmacological behavior of anticancer drugs, it is crucial to quantify the time course of pharmacodynamic responses in relation to the plasma concentration. A fundamental step in the preclinical development of oncology drugs is the in vivo evaluation of the antitumor effect. For this purpose, a series of experiments are performed, in which tumor cells from immortalized cell lines are inoculated into mice. Tumor volumes are measured at different times throughout the experiment for all animals, treated either with a vehicle (control) or with an active drug. The effect of the active molecule is then measured by comparing the average tumor weights in treated and control animals at the end of experiment, or by counting the animals surviving their disease (Fujimoto-Ouchi et al., 2002; Granucci et al., 1999; Hammond et al., 2000; Roose et al., 2007; Rowland et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2011; Sparano et al., 2008; Tanyi and Chu, 2012; Tod et al., 2008; Van der Graaf and Benson, 2011; Van Kesteren et al., 2000, 2003; Xie et al., 2009; Yap et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2002). This approach can be used to select the most potent candidate within a series of vaccines using the same dosing regimen, or the most appropriate dosing regimen among those tested for a specific compound. However, in this way, the whole course of the tumor growth timing is often neglected, so that only a partial use of the information available from the experiment is realized (only final points).Exposure-response modeling and simulation (M&S) has emerged during the last decade as a means to better understand the relationships of drug exposure-clinical outcomes of anticancer therapies (Danhof et al., 2008; Eftimie et al., 2011; Fujimoto-Ouchi et al., 2002; Granucci et al., 1999; Hammond et al., 2000; Jonsson et al., 2011; Van Kesteren et al., 2003). Contradictory contributions of a large dozens of factors suggest that M&S is a sophisticated tool to transform the data of multiple endpoints into knowledge (Bruno et al., 2001; Cabrales et al., 2008; Cintolo et al., 2012; Claret et al., 2009; Cornet et al., 2006; Danhof et al., 2008; Eftimie et al., 2011; Fujimoto-Ouchi et al., 2002; Granucci et al., 1999; Hammond et al., 2000; Jonsson et al., 2011; Koch et al., 2009; Lalonde et al., 2007; Morse et al., 2002; Olden and Jackson, 2002; Pili et al., 2001; Roose et al., 2007; Rowland et al., 2011; Van der Graaf and Benson, 2011; Van Kesteren et al., 2000, 2003).Empirical models use mathematical equations to describe the tumor growth process (Roose et al., 2007), without an in-depth mechanistic description of the underlying physiological processes. In this context, the dynamics of a drug can be evaluated only in terms of changes of the parameter values describing the tumor growth. These changes depend on the dose level as well as the administration schedule, so that those approaches can be applied only retrospectively and not as predictive tools when used outside the tested regimens.Functional models are nevertheless based on mechanistic, physiology-based hypotheses. In this case, it implies a set of assumptions about the tumor growth, including cell-cycle kinetics and biochemical processes, such as those related to anti-angiogenetic and/or immunological responses (Eftimie et al., 2011). Such models usually represent the cell population in its heterogeneity, splitting it into at least two subpopulations: the proliferating and the quiescent cells. More complex models describe the cell population as age-structured and take into account subpopulations related to specific phases of the cell cycle. These models have a much larger number of parameters compared with the empirical ones. Their development is so time-consuming and a number of quantitative observations (e.g., flow cytometry analyses, biochemical and immunological marker measurements, and so forth) are required to avoid the identifiability problems due to the over-parameterization. The situation becomes even more complicated when the effect of the treatment with an anticancer drug is also considered (Bodnar and Forys, 2007; Bousso, 2008; Bruno et al., 2001; Cabrales et al., 2008; Cornet et al., 2006; Danhof et al., 2008; Eftimie et al., 2011; Fujimoto-Ouchi et al., 2002; Granucci et al., 1999; Hammond et al., 2000; Jonsson et al., 2011; Koch et al., 2009; Lalonde et al., 2007; Lanzavecchia and Sallusto, 2001; LoRusso et al., 2008; Morse et al., 2002; Olden and Jackson, 2002; Pili et al., 2001; Roose et al., 2007; Rowland et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2011; Sparano et al., 2008), because of the incomplete knowledge of the mode of action in vivo. As a consequence, these models are rarely used in industrial drug research.Though, several tumor growth models have been proposed so far, a practical and exhaustive tool that supports oncology drug development is still missing. In this regard, the only metrics of success is the compatibility with the experimental data. In this paper, a model is presented associating with an effective compromise between empirical and mechanism-based approaches. It relies on a few identifiable and biologically relevant parameters. The estimation of the related parameters relies only on the data, typically available in the preclinical setting, the pharmacokinetics of the anticancer agents and the tumor growth curves in vivo.Dendritic cells (DCs) represent potent antigen-presenting cells (APC). The most widely emphasized functions of DCs are antigen uptake and processing. DCs activate T lymphocytes to initiate immune responses and also regulate the activation of T lymphocytes (Bousso, 2008; Bruno et al., 2001; Cabrales et al., 2008; Cintolo et al., 2012; Claret et al., 2009; Cornet et al., 2006; Danhof et al., 2008; Eftimie et al., 2011; Fujimoto-Ouchi et al., 2002; Granucci et al., 1999; Hammond et al., 2000; Jonsson et al., 2011; Koch et al., 2009; Lalonde et al., 2007; Lanzavecchia and Sallusto, 2001). Many factors can influence the development of polarized immune responses such as DC activation status. Many microbial components like bacterial CpG-DNA, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other microbial products have been shown to mature DCs and can regulate the activation of T cell responses (Cornet et al., 2006; Danhof et al., 2008; Eftimie et al., 2011; Fujimoto-Ouchi et al., 2002; Granucci et al., 1999).In oncology, the term tumor immunotherapy embraces a variety of different therapeutic approaches with the shared aim of exploiting effector mechanisms of the immune system to eliminate tumor cells (Sharma et al., 2011). Over the past decade, among the most intensively studied tumor immunotherapies have been DC-based cancer vaccines (Cintolo et al., 2012). Dendritic cells play a pivotal role in anti-tumor immune responses. Therefore, the maturation status of administrated DCs could potentially affect the efficacy and outcome of DC-based cancer immunotherapy (Morse et al., 2002; Olden and Jackson, 2002; Pili et al., 2001; Roose et al., 2007; Rowland et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2011; Sparano et al., 2008; Tanyi and Chu, 2012).Apart from general information about tumor behavior in the presence of different vaccines, no further information is available. So, the problem appears to be a black box type according to modeling paradigm. One of the main applications of artificial neural networks (ANN) as modeling tools is in the cases where just the input and output of a system are available and there is no more information about different internal parts of the system (Olden and Jackson, 2002) (black box modeling paradigm). Accordingly, ANN is here used to model the behavior of tumor growth considering different vaccination profiles.Six-to-eight week's old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Lab. Animal Center, Institute of Pasteur of Iran. All of the animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the current best practices and ethical principles. BALB/c-derived fibrosarcoma (WEHI-164) cell-line were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco-USA), 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco-USA), antibiotics, and 1% l-glutamine (Sigma-Germany).Bone marrow cells were obtained from the femur and tibia of female BALB/c mice; 106cellsml−1 were placed in 24-well plates in RPMI plus 10% FCS, 20ngml−1 GM-CSF (R&D systems, USA) and 10ngml−1 IL-4 (R&D systems, USA). After 3 days, non-adherent cells were gently collected into a new plate and fresh media was added. On day 5, 100μgml−1 of tumor lysate (TL) was added to immature DC cultures. After 4–6h in some wells 10μg CpG, 1μg LPS and 70mg lysate of Listeria monocytogenes was added. Non-adherent DCs in all wells were harvested on day 7 of the culture and used for tumor immunotherapy.To generate tumor, mice were injected subcutaneously in the right flank with 200μl of 1.5×106 WEHI-164cells. One, two or three doses of 106 TL-loaded DCs or TL-loaded and three groups of matured DCs (CpG-matured DCs, LPS-matured DCs and Listeria monocytogenes-matured DCs) were injected around tumors in different groups of mice at 7th, 10th and 13th days after tumor implantation (one dose only at 7th day, two doses at 7th and 10th days and alike). When the tumor was palpable, the shortest and longest surface diameters were measured every 2 days using digital calipers. The tumor area was achieved by multiplying the shortest and longest axis of the tumor and then the mean of tumor growth rate per 48h was calculated. Mice were sacrificed when the tumor size reached above 400mm2 (>400mm2).Mice were clinically evaluated daily and were weighed every two days. Dimensions of the tumors were measured regularly by caliper during the experiments, and tumor masses were calculated as following:(1)Tumor weight(mg)=Length(mm)⋅width2(mm2)2ρassuming densityρ=1mg/mm3for tumor tissue
