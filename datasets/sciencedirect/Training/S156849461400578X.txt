In this study, two induced generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid operators called the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid weighted averaging (IG-HFSHWA) operator and the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid geometric mean (IG-HFSHGM) operator are defined. The prominent characteristics of these two operators are that they do not only globally consider the importance of elements and their ordered positions, but also overall reflect their correlations. Furthermore, when the weight information of the attributes and the ordered positions is partly known, using grey relational analysis (GRA) method and the Shapley function models for the optimal fuzzy measures on an attribute set and on an ordered set are respectively established. Finally, an approach to hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision making with incomplete weight information and interactive conditions is developed, and an illustrative example is provided to show its practicality and effectivity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
As an extension of fuzzy sets [1], hesitant fuzzy sets [2] permit the membership degree having a set of possible values. The popularity of hesitant fuzzy sets for solving decision-making problems is that they facilitate effectively representing inherent hesitancy and uncertainty in the human decision making process. Torra [2] discussed the relationship between hesitant fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets and showed that the envelope of a hesitant fuzzy set h≠Ø is an intuitionistic fuzzy set. Based on the relationship between hesitant fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Xia and Xu [3] defined some operational laws on hesitant fuzzy sets and presented some hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. Based on the idea of quasi-arithmetic means, Xia et al. [4] developed a series of hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators and applied them to decision making. Motivated by the idea of the prioritized aggregation operator, Wei [5] developed the hesitant fuzzy prioritized weighted average (HFPWA) operator and the hesitant fuzzy prioritized weighted geometric (HFPWG) operator. Based on the Bonferroni mean (BM), Zhu et al. [6] introduced the weighted hesitant fuzzy geometric Bonferroni mean (WHFGBM) operator. Xu and Xia [7,8] defined some distance measures for hesitant fuzzy sets and presented a distance and correlation measure for hesitant fuzzy information, whilst Xu and Xia [9] studied entropy and cross-entropy of hesitant fuzzy sets and applied them to multi-attribute decision making. Liao and Xu [10] applied the VIKOR-based method to hesitate fuzzy multi-criteria decision making, whilst Chen et al. [11] developed an approach to multi-criteria decision making under hesitant fuzzy environment using the ELECTRE I. Furthermore, Chen et al. [12] studied some correlation coefficients of hesitant fuzzy sets and researched their application in clustering analysis. However, these measures are all defined under the assumption that the values in all HFEs are arranged in an increasing order, and two compared HFEs must have the same length.To cope with the situation where the elements in a set are correlative, some hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators based on fuzzy measures [13] are defined, such as the weighted hesitant fuzzy Choquet geometric Bonferroni mean (WHFCGBM) operator [6], the hesitant fuzzy Choquet geometric (HFCG) operator [14], the generalized hesitant fuzzy Choquet ordered averaging (GHFCOA) operator and the generalized hesitant fuzzy Choquet ordered geometric (GHFCOG) operator [15]. All these operators are based on the assumption that the fuzzy measure on an attribute set is completely known. However, because of various reasons, such as time pressure and the expert's limited expertise about the problem domain, the weight information in the process of decision making may be partly known. As Meng et al. [16] noted, the Choquet integral only reflects the interaction between two adjacent coalitions. Furthermore, the Choquet integral can either give the importance of elements or that of ordered positions, but it cannot both consider these two aspects.To cope with these issues, this study presents two induced generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid Shapley operators, which do not only globally consider the importance of the elements in a set and their ordered positions, but also overall reflect their correlations. Furthermore, when the weight vectors on the attribute set and on the ordered set are partly known, models for the optimal fuzzy measures are respectively established, by which the weight vectors on them can be obtained. As a series of development, a method to hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision making with incomplete weight information and interaction conditions is developed. To do these, the rest parts of this paper are organized as follows:In Section 2, some basic concepts about hesitant fuzzy sets are briefly reviewed, and some existing hesitant fuzzy hybrid aggregation operators are introduced. In Section 3, the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid weighted averaging (IG-HFSHWA) operator and the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid geometric mean (IG-HFSHGM) operator are defined, and some important cases are examined. In Section 4, based on grey relational analysis (GRA) method and the Shapley function, models for the optimal fuzzy measures on the attribute set and on the ordered set are respectively established. In Section 5, an approach to hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision making with incomplete weight information and interaction conditions is developed, and a numerical example is provided to illustrate the developed procedure. The conclusion is made in the last section.To cope with the situation where the membership degree of an element has several possible values, Torra [2] introduced the concept of hesitant fuzzy sets.Definition 1[2] Let X={x1, x2, …, xn}be a finite set, a hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) on X is in terms of a function that when applied to X returns a subset of [0,1].To be easily understood, the HFS is expressed by a mathematical symbolE=(<xi,hE(xi)>|xi∈X),where hE(xi) is a set of some values in [0,1] denoting the possible membership degrees of the element xi∈X to the set E. For convenience, Xia and Xu [3] called h=hE(xi) a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE). Let H be the set of all HFEs.Given three HFEs represented by h, h1 and h2, Torra [2] defined some operations on them, which can be described as follows:(1)hc=∪r∈h{1−r};h1∪h2=∪rr1∈h1,r2∈h2max{r1,r2};h1∩h2=∪r1∈h1,r2∈h2min{r1,r2}.Based on the relationship between HFEs and intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs), Xia and Xu [3] defined the following new operations on the HFEs h, h1 and h2:(1)hλ=∪r∈h{rλ}λ>0;λh=∪r∈h{1−(1−r)λ}λ>0;h1⊕h2=∪r1∈h1,r2∈h2{r1+r2−r1r2};h1⊗h2=∪r1∈h1,r2∈h2{r1r2}.Similar to the order relationship between intuitionistic fuzzy elements, Xia and Xu [3] defined the following score function to rank HFEs.[3] For a HFE h,S(h)=(1/#h)∑r∈hris called the score function of h, where #h is the number of the elements in h. For two HFEs h1 and h2, if S(h1)>S(h2), then h1>h2; if S(h1)=S(h2), then h1=h2.In some cases, the score function fails to distinguish between two distinct HFEs. For example, let h1={0.1, 0.9} and h2={0.3, 0.5, 0.7} be two HFEs, then their scores are both equal to 0.5. According to Definition 2, it has h1=h2. But they are obviously different. For any HFE h, the averaging deviation function is defined byD(h)=1#h∑r∈h(r−S(h))2=1#h∑r∈hr−1#h∑r∈hr2,where #h is the number of possible values in h.In order to increase the distinction of HFEs, the order relationship, for any two HFEs h1 and h2, is defined byIf S(h1)<S(h2), then h1<h2.If S(h1)<S(h2), thenD(h1)>D(h2),h1<h2D(h1)=D(h2),h1=h2.In above example, if the improvement method is used to rank h1={0.1, 0.9} and h2={0.3, 0.5, 0.7}, then h1<h2 for S(h1)<S(h2) and D(h1)>D(h2).To both consider the importance of elements and their ordered positions, Xia and Xu [3] defined two generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid operators called the generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid averaging (HFHA) operator and the generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid geometric (GHFHG) operator, given as in the following definition.[3] Let hi(i=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs in H, w=(w1, w2, …, wn)Tbe the weight vector on {hi}i=1, 2, …, n with wi∈[0,1] and∑i=1nwi=1, and ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tbe the associated weight vector on the ordered set N={1, 2, …, n} with ωi∈[0,1] and∑i=1nωi=1.(1) The generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid averaging (GHFHA) operator is defined byGHFHA(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕j=1nωjh˙(j)λ1/λ=∪r(1)∈h˙(1),r(2)∈h˙(2),…,r(n)∈h˙(n)1−∏j=1n(1−r(j)λ)ωj1/λ,where λ>0, (·) is a permutation on the weighted HFEs nwihi(i=1, 2, …, n) withh˙(j)=nw(j)h(j)being the jth largest value of nwihi(i=1, 2, …, n), and n is the balancing coefficient.(2) The generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid geometric (GHFHG) operator is defined byGHFHG(h1,h2,…,hn)=1λ⊗j=1n(λh˙(j))ωj=∪r(1)∈h˙(1),r(2)∈h˙(2),…,r(n)∈h˙(n)1−1−Πj=1n(1−(1−r(j))λ)ωj1/λ,where λ>0, (·) is a permutation on the weighted HFEshinwi(i=1, 2, …, n) withh˙(j)=h(j)nw(j)being the jth largest value ofhinwi(i=1, 2, …, n), and n is the balancing coefficient.Although the GHFHA and GHFHG operators both consider the importance of elements and their ordered positions, they are based on the assumption that the elements in a set are independent. In the practical decision-making problems, this assumption is usually violated, so it is unsuitable to aggregate their values using additive measures. In 1974, Sugeno [13] introduced the following concept of fuzzy measures.Definition 4[13] A fuzzy measure on finite set N={1, 2, …, n} is a set function μ:P(N)→[0, 1] satisfying(1)μ(∅)=0, μ(N)=1;For all A, B∈P(N) with A⊆B, μ(A)≤μ(B),To reflect the interactive characteristics between elements, Wei et al. [15] defined the following generalized hesitant fuzzy Choquet integral operators.Definition 5[15] Let hi(i=1, 2, …, n) be a collection of HFEs in H, and μ be a fuzzy measure on N={1, 2, …, n}.(1) The generalized hesitant fuzzy Choquet ordered averaging (GHFCOA) operator is defined byGHFCOA(h1,h2,…,hn)=⊕i=1n(μ(A(i))−μ(A(i+1)))h(i)λ1/λ(2) The generalized hesitant fuzzy Choquet ordered geometric (GHFCOG) operator is defined byGHFCOG(h1,h2,...,hn)=1λ⊗i=1n(λh(i))μ(A(i))−μ(A(i+1));where λ>0, (·) indicates a permutation on N such that h(1)≤h(2)≤…≤h(n), and A(i)={i, ..., n} with A(n+1)=∅.From Definition 5, we know that the GHFCOA and GHFCOG operators consider the importance of their ordered positions and reflect their correlations. However, they neither consider the importance of the elements nor reflect their correlations.To eliminate the mentioned issues, this section presents two new hesitant fuzzy operators that globally consider the importance of the elements and their ordered positions as well as reflect their interactions.The Shapley function [17] as one of the most important payoff indices in game theory receives considerable attentions. When it is calculated with respect to the fuzzy measure μ on finite set N={1, 2, …, n}, it has(1)φi(μ,N)=∑S⊆N\i(n−s−1)!s!n!(μ(S∪i)−μ(S))∀i∈N,where s and n respectively denote the cardinalities of S and N.From Eq. (1), we know thatpns=((n−s−1)!s!)/n!is a probability weight with∑S⊆N\ipns=1andpns>0for each S⊆N. The Shapley function is actually an expectation value of the marginal contribution between the element i and any coalition S⊆N\i. From the definition of fuzzy measures, it is not difficult to know that φi(μ, N)≥0 for any i∈N and∑i=1nφi(μ,N)=1. It means that{φi(μ,N)}i∈Nis a weight vector.When the fuzzy measure μ is defined on an attribute set, μ(A) can be viewed as the importance of the attribute set A. Thus, in addition to the usual weights on the attribute set taken separately, weights on any combination of attributes are also defined. If we apply the attributes’ Shapley values as their weights, then it does not only consider their importance, but also reflect the influence from the other attributes. It is worth pointing out that if there is no interaction between attributes, then their Shapley values are equal to the importance of their own. Thus, the Shapley value can be seen as an extension of additive weights. In the multi-attribute decision making, if we consider the interactions between attributes, then the Shapley function may be a good choice.The induced generalized aggregation operator is an important kind of aggregation operators that has been researched by many scholars, such as the generalized OWA (GOWA) operator [18], the induced generalized OWA (IGOWA) operator [19], the uncertain induced quasi-arithmetic OWA (UIQAOWA) operator [20], the induced generalized hybrid averaging (IGHA) operator [21], the induced generalized intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation (IGIFA) operator [22], the induced interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid aggregation (I-IVIFHA) operator [23], the induced 2-tuple linguistic generalized OWA (I-2TLGOWA) operator [24], and the induced uncertain linguistic OWA (I-ULOWA) operator [25]. Based on the Shapely function, we define the following two induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid operators.Definition 6An IG-HFSHWA operator of dimension n is a mapping IG-HFSHWA: Hn→H on the set of second arguments of two tuples 〈u1, h1〉, 〈u2, h2〉, …, 〈un, hn〉 with a set of order-inducing variables ui(i=1, 2, …, n) and a parameter γ such that γ∈(0, +∞), denoted byIG-HFSHWA(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=⊕j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)γ(v,Q)h(j)γ∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)γ(v,Q)1/γ,where (·) is a permutation on ui(i=1, 2, …, n) with u(j) being the jth largest value of ui(i=1, 2, …, n), φj(μ, N) is the Shapley value with respect to (w.r.t.) the associated fuzzy measure μ on N={1, 2, …, n} for the jth ordered position, andφhj(v,Q)is the Shapley value w.r.t. the fuzzy measure v onQ={hj}j=1,…,nfor hj(j=1, 2, …, n).If μ and v are both additive measures, then the IG-HFSHWA operator degenerates to the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid weighted averaging (IG-HFHWA) operatorIG-HFHWA(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=∑j=1nwjωh(j)γh(j)γ∑j=1nwjωh(j)γ1/γ,wherewj=μ(j)andωhj=v(hj)for each j=1, 2, …, n.If ui=ujfor all i, j=1, 2, …, n with i≠j, then the IG-HFSHWA operator degenerates to the generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid OWA (G-HFSHOWA) operatorG-HFSHOWA(h1,h2,…,hn)==⊕j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)γ(v,Q)h(j)γ∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)γ(v,Q)1/γ,whereφh(j)(v,Q)h(j)is the jth largest value of the Shapley weighted HFEsφhi(v,Q)hi(i=1, 2, …, n).If γ=1, then the IG-HFSHWA operator degenerates to the induced hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid weighted averaging (I-HFSHWA) operatorI-HFSHWA(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=⊕j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q)h(j)∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q).If γ=2, then the IG-HFSHWA operator degenerates to the induced hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid quadratic weighted averaging (I-HFSHQWA) operatorI-HFSHQWA(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=⊕j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)2(v,Q)h(j)2∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)2(v,Q)1/2.Ifv(hi)=1/nfor each i=1, 2, …, n, then the IG-HFSHWA operator degenerates to the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley OWA (IG-HFSOWA) operatorIG-HFSOWA(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=⊕j=1nφj(μ,N)h(j)γ1/γ.Furthermore, if γ→0+, then the IG-HFSHWA operator degenerates to the induced hesitant fuzzy Shapley ordered geometric mean (I-HFSOGM) operatorI-HFSOGM(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=⊗j=1nh(j)φj(μ,N).If μ(j)=1/n for each j=1, 2, …, n, then the IG-HFSHWA operator degenerates to the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley weighted averaging (IG-HFSWA) operatorIG-HFSWA(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=⊕j=1nφh(j)γ(v,Q)h(j)γ∑j=1nφh(j)γ(v,Q)1/γ.Let 〈u1, h1〉, 〈u2, h2〉, …, 〈un, hn〉 be a set of two tuples with a set of order-inducing variables ui(i=1, 2, …, n) and hi(i=1, 2, …, n) being a collection of HFEs in H, let μ be a fuzzy measure on the ordered set N={1, 2, …, n}, and let v be the associated fuzzy measure on Q={hi}i∈N. Then, their aggregated value using the IG-HFSHWA operator is also a HFE, denoted byIG-HFSHWA(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=∪r(1)∈h(1),r(2)∈h(2),...,r(n)∈h(n)1−∏j=1n(1−r(j)r)φj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q)/∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q)1/γwhere the notations as shown inDefinition 6.In a similar way to the IG-HFSHWA operator, we define the following induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid geometric mean (IG-HFSHGM) operator.Definition 7An IG-HFSHGM operator of dimension n is a mapping IG-HFSHGM: Hn→H on the set of second arguments of two tuples 〈u1, h1〉, 〈u2, h2〉, …, 〈un, hn〉 with a set of order-inducing variables ui(i=1, 2, …, n) and a parameter γ such that γ∈(0, +∞), denoted byIG-HFSHGM(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=1γ⊗j=1nγh(j)φh(j)(v,Q)φj(μ,N)/∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q),where (·) is a permutation on ui(i=1, 2, …, n) with u(j) being the jth largest value of ui(i=1, 2, …, n), φj(μ, N) is the Shapley value w.r.t. the associated fuzzy measure μ on N={1, 2, …, n} for the jth ordered position, andφh(j)(v,Q)is the Shapley value w.r.t. the fuzzy measure v onQ={hj}j=1,…,nfor hj(j=1, 2, …, n).If μ and v are both additive measures, then the IG-HFSHGM operator degenerates to the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy hybrid geometric mean (IG-HFHGM) operatorIG-HFHGM(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=1γ⊗j=1nγh(j)ωh(j)wj/∑j=1nwjωh(j)wherewj=μ(j)andωhj=v(hj)for each j=1, 2, …, n.If ui=ujfor all i, j=1, 2, …, n with i≠j, then the IG-HFHSGM operator degenerates to the generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid ordered geometric mean (G-HFSHOGM) operatorG-HFSHOGM(h1,h2,…,hn)=1γ⊗j=1nγh(j)φh(j)(v,Q)φj(μ,N)/∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q),whereh(j)φh(j)(v,Q)is the jth largest value of the Shapley weighted HFEshiφhi(v,Q)(i=1, 2, …, n).If γ=1, then the IG-HFSHGM operator degenerates to the induced hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid geometric mean (I-HFSHGM) operatorI-HFSHGM(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=⊗j=1nh(j)φj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q)/∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q)If γ=2, then the IG-HFSHGM operator degenerates to the induced hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid quadratic geometric mean (I-HFSHQGM) operatorI-HFSHQGM(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=12⊗j=1n(2h(j)φh(j)(v,Q))φj(μ,N)/∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q)If μ(j)=1/n for each j=1, 2, …, n, then the IG-HFSHGM operator degenerates to the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley geometric mean (IG-HFSGM) operatorIG-HFSGM(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=1γ⊗j=1nγh(j)φh(j)(v,Q)Let 〈u1, h1〉, 〈u2, h2〉, …, 〈un, hn〉 be a set of two tuples with a set of order-inducing variables ui(i=1, 2, …, n) and hi(i=1, 2, …, n) being a collection of HFEs in H, let μ be a fuzzy measure on the ordered set N={1, 2, …, n}, and let v be the associated fuzzy measure on Q={hi}i∈N. Then, their aggregated value using the IG-HFSHGM operator is also a HFE, denoted byIG-HFSHGM(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=∪r(1)∈h(1),r(2)∈h(2),…,r(n)∈h(n)1−1−∏j=1n(1−(1−r(j)φh(j)(v,Q))γ)φj(μ,N)/∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φh(j)(v,Q)1/γwhere the notations as shown inDefinition 7.From Theorems 1 and 2, it is not difficult to know that the IG-HFSHWA and IG-HFSHGM operators satisfy commutativity, monotonicity and boundary. Here, we on longer discuss them in detail.Consider a decision-making problem, Let A={a1, a2, …, am} be the set of alternatives, and C={c1, c2, …, cn} be the set of attributes. The decision makers are allowed to make their individual preferences for alternatives w.r.t. each attribute. If the decision makers provide several values for the alternative aiw.r.t. the attribute cj, this preference can be considered as a HFE hij. ByH=(hij)m×n, we denote the hesitant fuzzy decision matrix given by the decision makers. If the weight information about attributes and their ordered positions are completely known, then we can use some aggregation operator to calculate the comprehensive attribute values. Otherwise, we first need to obtain the weights of the attributes and their ordered positions.Grey relational analysis (GRA) method [26] as an important multi-attribute decision making method has been researched by many scholars [27–33]. To define the grey relational coefficient for HFEs, we first introduce the following distance measure on HFEs.Definition 8Let h1 and h2 be any two HFEs in H, then the distance between h1 and h2 is defined by(2)d(h1,h2)=1#h1+#h2∑r1∈h1minr2∈h2|r1−r2|+∑r2∈h2minr1∈h1|r2−r1|,where #h1 and #h2 respectively denote the numbers of elements in h1 and h2.Let h1and h2be any two HFEs in H, then the distance between h1and h2defined by Eq.(2)satisfies the following properties:(P1) 0≤d(h1, h2)≤1;(P2) d(h1, h2)=0 if and only if h1=h2;(P3) d(h1, h2)=d(h2, h1).For (P1): Since 0≤|r1−r2|≤1 for all r1∈h1 and all r2∈h2, we have0≤∑r1∈h1minr2∈h2|r1−r2|+∑r2∈h2minr1∈h1|r2−r1|≤#h1+#h2.Thus, 0≤d(h1, h2)≤1.For (P2): If h1=h2, thenminr2∈h2|r1−r2|=minr1∈h1|r2−r1|=0for all r1∈h1 and all r2∈h2. Thus, d(h1, h2)=0. On the other hand, if d(h1, h2)=0, thenminr2∈h2|r1−r2|=minr1∈h1|r2−r1|=0. It means that there exists r2∈h2 for any r1∈h1 such that r1=r2 as well as there exists r1∈h1 for any r2∈h2 such that r1=r2. Thus, h1=h2.For (P3): From (2), it is easy to get the conclusion.For the hesitant fuzzy decision matrixH=(hij)m×n, letH+={h1+,h2+,…,hn+}H−={h1−,h2−,…,hn−},wherehj+=h(m)jandhj−=h(1)jfor each j=1, 2, …, n, and (·) is a permutation on M={1, 2, …, m} such that h(1)j≤h(2)j≤…≤h(m)j.Similar to the grey relational coefficients of intuitionistic fuzzy sets given by Wei [29,30], we define the grey relational coefficients from the positive-ideal solution (PIS) and negative-ideal solution (NIS) as follows:(3)ξij+=min1≤i≤mmin1≤j≤nd(hij,hj+)+ρmax1≤i≤mmax1≤j≤nd(hij,hj+)d(hij,hj+)+ρmax1≤i≤mmax1≤j≤nd(hij,hj+),(4)ξij−=min1≤i≤mmin1≤j≤nd(hij,hj−)+ρmax1≤i≤mmax1≤j≤nd(hij,hj−)d(hij,hj−)+ρmax1≤i≤mmax1≤j≤nd(hij,hj−)for each pair (i, j) (i=1, 2, …, m; j=1, 2, …, n), where ρ is usually equal to 0.5.If the weight information of the attributes is partly known, we build the following model for the optimal fuzzy measure v on the attribute set C w.r.t. the alternative ai(i=1, 2, …, m).(5)min∑j=1nξij−ξij++ξij−φcj(v,C)s.t.v(C)=1v(S)≤v(T)∀S,T⊆Cs.t.S⊆Tv(cj)∈Ucj,v(cj)≥0,j=1,2,…,n,whereφcj(v,C)is the Shapley value of the attribute cjw.r.t. the fuzzy measure v, andUcjis the known weight information (j=1, 2, …, n).Since all alternatives are non inferior, we further build the following model for the optimal fuzzy measure v on the attribute set C.(6)min∑i=1m∑j=1nξij−ξij++ξij−φcj(v,C)s.t.v(C)=1v(S)≤v(T)∀S,T⊆Cs.t.S⊆Tv(cj)∈Ucj,v(cj)≥0,j=1,2,…,nNow, we consider the optimal fuzzy measure on the ordered set N. For the hesitant fuzzy decision matrixH=(hij)m×n, letH¯={h¯1,h¯2,…,h¯n},whereh¯j=(1/m)⊕i=1mhijfor each j=1, 2, …, n.We define the grey relational coefficient of hijandh¯jas follows:(7)ξ¯ij=min1≤i≤mmin1≤j≤nd(hij,h¯j)+ρmax1≤i≤mmax1≤j≤nd(hij,h¯j)d(hij,h¯j)+ρmax1≤i≤mmax1≤j≤nd(hij,h¯j).for each pair (i, j) (i=1, 2, …, m; j=1, 2, …, n), where ρ is usually equal to 0.5.For each i=1, 2, …, m, reorderξ¯ij(j=1, 2, …, n) such thatξ¯i(j)being the jth largest value ofξ¯ij(j=1, 2, …, n).

If there are no interactive characteristics between attributes and between their ordered positions, then models (6) and (9) respectively degenerate to models for the optimal additive weight vectors on the attribute set and on the ordered set.Based on the introduced aggregation operators and models for the optimal fuzzy measures, this section presents a method to hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision making with incomplete weight information and interactive conditions. The decision procedure can be described as follows:Step 1: Suppose that there exist m alternatives A={a1, a2, …, am} to be evaluated according to n attributes C={c1, c2, …, cn} to form the hesitant fuzzy decision matrixH=(hij)m×n, where hijis a HFE.Step 2: If all attributes cj(j=1, 2, …, n) are benefits (i.e., the bigger the better), then the attribute values do not need normalization. Otherwise, we need to normalize the hesitant fuzzy decision matrixH=(hij)m×nintoH′=(h′ij)m×n, whereh′ij=hijforbenefitattributecjhijcforcostattributecj(i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n)withhijc=∪r∈hij{1−r}.Step 3: Utilize model (6) to solve the optimal fuzzy measure v on the attribute set C, and calculate their Shapley values.Step 4: Utilize model (9) to solve the optimal fuzzy measure μ on the ordered set N, and calculate their Shapley values.Step 5: Letuj=ξ¯ij(j=1, 2, …, n) for each i=1, 2, …, m, utilize the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid weighted averaging (IG-HFSHWA) operatorhi=IG-HFSHWA(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=∪ri(1)∈hi(1),ri(2)∈hi(2),…,ri(n)∈hi(n)1−∏j=1n(1−ri(j)γ)φj(μ,N)φc(j)(v,C)/∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φc(j)(v,C)1/λor the induced generalized hesitant fuzzy Shapley hybrid geometric mean (IG-HFSHGM) operatorhi=IG-HFSHGM(〈u1,h1〉,〈u2,h2〉,…,〈un,hn〉)=∪ri(1)∈hi(1),ri(2)∈hi(2),…,ri(n)∈hi(n)1−1−∏j=1n(1−(1−ri(j)φc(j)(v,C))γ)φj(μ,N)/∑j=1nφj(μ,N)φc(j)(v,C)1/γto calculate the comprehensive HFEs hi(i=1, 2, …, m) of the alternatives ai(i=1, 2, …, m).Step 6: According to the comprehensive HFEs hi(i=1, 2, …, m), calculate the score value S(hi) and the averaging deviation value D(hi). Then, to rank the comprehensive HFEs hi(i=1, 2, …, m), and select the best alternative(s).Step 7: End.There is a panel with five possible emerging technology enterprises ai(i=1–5) to select (adapted from Ref. [15]). The experts select four attributes to evaluate the five possible emerging technology enterprises: c1 is the technical advancement; c2 is the potential market; c3 is the industrialization infrastructure, human resources and financial conditions; c4 is the employment creation and the development of science and technology. To avoid influence each other, the decision makers are required to evaluate the five possible alternatives ai(i=1–5) under the above four attributes in anonymity and the hesitant fuzzy decision matrixH=(hij)m×nis presented in Table 1, where hij(i=1–5; j=1–4) are in the form of HFEs.Because of time pressure and the expert's limited expertise about the problem domain, the weight information of the attributes is partly known. They are respectively given byUc1=[0.2,0.4],Uc2=[0.25,0.45],Uc3=[0.2,0.4]andUc4=[0.15,0.3]. Furthermore, the importance of the ordered positions is respectively defined by U1=[0.1, 0.2], U2=[0.2, 0.3], U3=[0.3, 0.4] and U4=[0.4, 0.5]. To effectively solve this problem, the above proposed decision procedure is followed for determining the most desirable alternative(s).Step 1: Since all attributes are benefits, there is on need to normalize the hesitant fuzzy decision matrix H, namely, H=H′.Step 2: Let ρ=0.5, from Eqs. (3) and (4), we get the grey relational coefficient of each alternative from PIS and NIS as follows:ξ+=(ξij+)5×4=0.36720.7090.76470.35140.5820.73030.37860.61910.61910.520.6190.5870.68420.53720.532110.33331,ξ−=(ξij−)5×4=10.79110.419410.67010.76470.76460.40370.36720.66110.33330.6190.565210.520.6190.49360.587110.2453.According to model (6), it gets the following linear programming for the optimal fuzzy measure v on the attribute set C.min0.005(v(c1)−v(c2,c3,c4))+0.0256(v(c2)−v(c1,c3,c4))−0.0079(v(c3)−v(c1,c2,c4))−0.0227(v(c4)−v(c1,c2,c3))+0.0153(v(c1,c2)−v(c3,c4))−0.0014(v(c1,c3)−v(c2,c4))−0.0088(v(c1,c4)−v(c2,c3))+2.4786s.t.v(C)=1v(S)≤v(T)∀S,T⊆{c1,c2,c3,c4}v(c1)∈[0.2,0.4],v(c2)∈[0.25,0.45]v(c3)∈[0.2,0.4],v(c4)∈[0.15,0.3].Solve the above linear programming, the optimal fuzzy measure v on the attribute set C are obtained as shown in Table 2.According to Table 2, it derives the following Shapley valuesφc1(v,C)=0.1667,φc2(v,C)=0.0667,φc3(v,C)=0.1833,φc4(v,C)=0.5833.Step 3: From Eq.

Take the comprehensive hesitant fuzzy element h1 for an example, and let λ=1, it hash1=G-HFSHWA(〈u1,h11〉,〈u2,h12〉,〈u3,h13〉,〈u4,h14〉)=∪r11∈h11,r14∈h14,r12∈h12,r13∈h131−(1−r11)φ1(μ,N)φc1(v,C)/∑j=14φj(μ,N)φc(j)(v,C)(1−r14)φ2(μ,N)φc4(v,C)/∑j=14φj(μ,N)φc(j)(v,C)(1−r12)φ3(μ,N)φc2(v,C)/∑j=14φj(μ,N)φc(j)(v,C)×(1−r13)φ4(μ,N)φc3(v,C)/∑j=14φj(μ,N)φc(j)(v,C)={0.5783,0.5528,0.6049,0.5079,0.6409,0.6614,0.5214,0.565,0.5898,0.6157,0.6057,0.6706,0.5276,0.5707,0.5952,0.6207,0.6553,0.6749,0.5092,0.554,0.5794,0.6059,0.6419,0.6623,0.5226,0.5661,0.5909,0.6167,0.6516,0.6715,0.5288,0.5718,0.5962,0.6217,0.6562,0.6758,}where∑j=14φj(μ,N)φc(j)(v,C)=φ1(μ,N)φc1(v,C)+φ2(μ,N)φc4(v,C)+φ3(μ,N)φc2(v,C)+φ4(μ,N)φc3(v,C).Step 5: According to the comprehensive HFEs hi(i=1–5), the score values S(hi) (i=1–5) are obtained as follows:S(h1)=0.6007,S(h2)=0.5525,S(h3)=0.5092,S(h4)=0.5958,S(h5)=0.5944.Thus, the emerging technology enterprise a3 is the best choice.In the above example, we only use the IG-HFSHWA operator with λ=1 to get the best choice. For the convenience of comparison, ranking results w.r.t. the different aggregation operators and the different values of λ are obtained as shown in Tables 4–7.The ranking results show that the different optimal alternatives may be yielded by using the different aggregation operators. Although the ranking results are different, the same optimal alternative is obtained by using the same operator and the different values of λ. Thus, the decision maker can properly select the desirable alternative according to his interest and the actual needs. However, if there is no special explanation that the attributes and the ordered positions are respectively independent, we suggest the experts use the aggregation operators based on fuzzy measures. Furthermore, since the hybrid aggregation operator considers more information than the OWA operator and the weighted averaging operator, we advise the experts to apply the hybrid aggregation operator.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have developed an approach to hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision making with incomplete weight information and interactive conditions. In order to get the comprehensive attribute values, two new induced generalized hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators are defined, which do not only consider the importance of the elements and their ordered positions but also reflect their interactions. In many practical decision-making problems, because of various reasons, the weight vectors on the attribute set and on the ordered set are usually partly known. To obtain their optimal weight vectors, the corresponding models are established by using grey relational analysis (GRA) method and the Shapley function.Although the fuzzy measures can well cope with the situations where the elements in a set are interactive, they are defined on the power set. It makes the problem exponentially complex. Thus, it will be interesting to research hesitant fuzzy multi-attribute decision making by using some special kinds of fuzzy measures, such as λ-fuzzy measures [13], k-additive measures [34] and p-symmetry measures [35].In this paper, we have only studied HFSs, and it will be interesting to research other kinds of hesitant fuzzy sets using fuzzy measures, such as dual hesitant fuzzy sets [36], interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets [37], interval-valued intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy sets [38], and hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets [39].Besides the hybrid aggregation operator, many researchers developed some other kinds of important aggregation operators. For example, Torra [40] introduced the weighted OWA (WOWA) operator using a monotonic function. Yager et al. [41] introduced the concept of immediate weights that both consider the importance of the elements and the ordered positions, whilst Merigó and Gil-Lafuente [42] defined some immediate weighted distance operators and researched their application to multi-person decision-making in production management. Furthermore, Yager [43] discussed the importance weights in the OWA operator using transformation functions, and Merigó [44] defined the weights using weighted average of the weights of the elements and that of the ordered positions and presented the induced ordered weighted averaging-weighted average (IOWAWA) operator. It is one of our future research works to consider these operators in the setting of hesitant fuzzy environment based on fuzzy measures.
