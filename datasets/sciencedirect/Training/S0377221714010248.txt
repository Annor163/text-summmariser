@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This note extends the results on the first four derivatives of the utility function by Menegatti (Eur. J. Oper. Res. 232 (2014) 613–617) to the case of high-order derivatives. We show that, under usual assumptions, if the generic derivative of the utility function of order n is sign invariant then all the derivatives from order n to order 2 alternate in sign. We then focus on the case where the derivative of the utility function of order n is either positive when n is odd or negative when n is even, and we show the implications of this result for high-order risk changes and for saving decisions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The analysis of high-order risk changes, first introduced by Ekern (1980), is relevant to many economic problems involving risk comparison (Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger, 2006; Eeckhoudt, Schlesinger, and Tsetlin, 2009), portfolio choices (for instance, Ingersoll, 1987; Levy, 2006) and precautionary saving (Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger, 2008). Many papers (see, for instance, Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger, 2006; Ekern, 1980) studied the linkages between high-order risk changes and agent preferences, showing that the high-order risk changes are related to the signs of the high-order derivatives of the utility function.In a recent paper, Menegatti (2014) showed that, under usual assumptions on preferences, the signs of the first four derivatives of the utility function are related each other and, in particular, that a negative fourth derivative (a feature of preferences called “temperance”) implies a positive third derivative (“prudence”) which implies in turn a negative second derivative (“risk aversion”).11For a more detailed description of the implications of temperance, prudence and risk aversion in choice under uncertainty see, for instance, Gollier (2001).This note generalizes Menegatti’s results to the case of high-order derivatives of the utility function and shows applications to high-order risk changes and to saving decisions. The note proceeds as follows. Section 2 shows the new results on high-order derivatives of the utility function. Section 3 studies the implications for high-order risk changes and for saving. Section 4 concludes.We assume that agent’s preferences are described by the utility function U(x) defined over the domain [0, +∞) and continuous in the whole domain. We also assume that the utility function is differentiable n times. We finally introduce the two usual assumptions that marginal utility is positive (dU(x)dx>0), usually called “non-satiation”, and that it is bounded above for x → +∞, i.e.limx→+∞dU(x)dx≠+∞. This set of assumptions is exactly the same (except for differentiability n times) introduced in Menegatti (2014). In the present note we offer some observations and comments on this. See also the discussion in Menegatti (2014).The introduction of this set of assumptions on the utility function is clearly motivated by the literature since all these hypotheses are standard in utility theory and since they have very plausible implications for agent’s preferences and agent’s behaviour. We specifically discuss each of the assumptions below.We start with the assumption of unbounded domain for U(x). Note first that this hypothesis is introduced in standard microeconomic theory (see, for instance, the well-known book by Mas-Colell, Winston, and Green, 1995, p. 51), in many papers studying agent’s preferences in risky contexts (e.g. Brockett and Golden, 1987; Caballé and Pomansky, 1996; Finkelshtain, Kella, and Scarsini, 1999; Kimball, 1993; Menegatti, 2001; Pratt and Zeckhauser, 1987), and in many papers analyzing risk problems (some recent examples are Çanakoğlu and Özekici, 2010; Choi and Ruszczyński, 2011; Gurio, 2012; Hart, 2011; Roger, 2011). Moreover in some models, such as endogenous growth models, the optimal consumption path is characterized by an unbounded growth of consumption level, which requires, in turn, an unbounded domain for the utility function. Similarly, in neoclassical growth models and in real-business-cycle models, the assumption is necessary when exogenous technological progress is introduced (see, for instance, standard books by Barro and Sala-i Martin, 2004, Chaps. 2 and 4 and Romer, 2012, Chaps. 2, 3 and 5).With regard to decision maker’s attitude and behaviour, note furthermore that the assumption of unbounded domain for U(x) does not mean that the agent has to deal with situations where consumption is infinite. It means rather that agent’s preferences are described by U(x) for every possible level of consumption. In fact, in a specific economic problem, agent’s consumption often takes values within a closed interval[x¯,x˜]. However if we want to study this problem for every possible value ofx¯andx˜,preferences need to be defined for the whole set R+.The second assumption in our set is non-satiation (sometimes also called “utility monotonicity”). This is a standard hypothesis on agent’s preferences in economic models where the utility function is introduced. (On this see for instance standard microeconomic books by Varian, 1992, p. 98, and by Mas-Colell et al., 1995, p. 51, the standard macroeconomic book by Romer, 2012, Chaps. 2, 3, 4 and 8 or the standard financial decision making book by Ingersoll, 1987, p. 21). In terms of interpretation, this assumption has a simple implication for decision maker’s preferences: it simply means that the agent likes consumption and that, thus, a larger consumption level is preferred to a lower consumption level.22Varian (1992, p. 98) simply says that this assumption means that “goods are good”.The last assumption introduced is the assumption of bounded marginal utility. This hypothesis is typical in models where domain is R+ (as in this work) and it is standard in many classes of economic models, such as dynamic consumption models and growth models (see for instance the standard books by Barro and Sala-i Martin, 2004, p. 87, and by Blanchard and Fisher, 1989, p. 38).33From a technical standpoint note that this assumption is introduced in some cases in order to ensure the existence of a solution path among other reasons. Furthermore, in growth models, we often introduce a hypothesis which is stronger thanlimx→+∞dU(x)dx≠+∞,by assuminglimx→+∞dU(x)dx=0(one of the so-called Inada conditions).In terms of economic interpretation, this assumption simply excludes the implausible case that, when consumption becomes extremely high, an additional unit of it generates an infinite increment in agent’s utility. Also note that this hypothesis does not mean that marginal utility is decreasing (i.e. it does not require concavity of the utility function) and is instead compatible with an increasing marginal utility.Finally, considering all the assumptions introduced together, it is important to emphasise that they do not impose any restriction on agent’s attitude toward risk. In particular, these assumptions do not require the agent to be risk averse, and are thus potentially compatible with risk aversion, risk neutrality and risk loving. Obviously, implications for the decision maker’s attitude toward risk can be derived from the results, but nothing in this respect is a priori imposed.Since all the assumptions introduced are standard in utility theory, they are all satisfied by the most frequently used utility functions. Typical utility functions, particularly in decision theory under uncertainty (see Gollier, 2001) are for instance:•logarithmic utility: U(x) = log(x);exponential utility (CARA utility): U(x) = −e−αx;CRRA utilityU(x)=x1−γ1−γ(with γ > 0 and γ ≠ 1).It is clear that all these functions satisfy the set of assumptions introduced above.Given these assumptions, we obtain some new results on the relationship between the derivatives of the utility function of different orders. In order to derive these results, we first recall a well-known theorem, sometimes called the “theorem of sign permanence”.44We omit the proof since the theorem is well-known. For a brief explanation see Menegatti (2014).Note that, in this theorem, we introduce for simplicity the following notation: limx → +∞f(x) ≡ f( + ∞). The same notation will be also used later on.Theorem 1Given a continuous function f(x), if   f( + ∞)  =   + ∞ then ∃x0 : f(x) > 0 ∀x ∈ (x0, +∞) and if f( + ∞) = −∞ then ∃x0: f(x) < 0 ∀x ∈ (x0, +∞).Given above assumptions and Theorem 1, we can now state that:55Note that Propositions 1, 2 and 3 and their proofs generalize the result of Propositions 1 and 2 in Menegatti (2014), concerning derivatives of orders 2, 3 and 4, to derivatives of order n.Proposition 1(a)IfdnU(x)dxn<0∀x∈[x0,+∞)(where n > 1 and x0 ≥ 0) thendn−1U(x)dxn−1>0∀x∈[x0,+∞).IfdnU(x)dxn>0∀x∈[x0,+∞)(where n > 2 and x0 ≥ 0) thendn−1U(x)dxn−1<0∀x∈[x0,+∞).(a)If n = 2 then the assertion follows from non-satiation assumption. Thus let us assume n > 2 and prove the assertion by contradiction. Assume∃x1∈[x0,+∞):dn−1U(x1)dxn−1≤0. Now sincednU(x)dxn<0∀x∈[x0,+∞),we have thatdn−1U(x)dxn−1is strictly decreasing ∀x ∈ [x1, +∞), implying in turn,(1)dn−1U(x)dxn−1<dn−1U(x1)dxn−1≤0∀x∈(x1,+∞)The assumptiondnU(x)dxn<0∀x∈[x0,+∞)together with (1) implies thatdn−2U(x)dxn−2is strictly decreasing and strictly concave ∀x ∈ [x1, +∞), implying in turn thatdn−2U(+∞)dxn−2=−∞. By Theorem 1, this implies∃x2:dn−2U(x)dxn−2<0∀x∈(x2,+∞). If n = 3 then this result contradicts non-satiation assumption, else if n > 3 then, by assuming x3 = max(x1, x2), this result together with (1) implies that the functiondn−3U(x)dxn−3is strictly decreasing and strictly concave ∀x ∈ (x3, +∞), implying in turndn−3U(+∞)dxn−3=−∞. Repeating recursively previous steps we getdjU(+∞)dxj=−∞for j = n − 4, …, 1. The result for j = 1 contradicts non-satiation.By contradiction. Assume∃x1∈[x0,+∞):dn−1U(x1)dxn−1≥0. Now sincednU(x)dxn>0∀x∈[x0,+∞),we have thatdn−1U(x)dxn−1is strictly increasing ∀x ∈ [x1, +∞), implying in turn,(2)dn−1U(x)dxn−1>dn−1U(x1)dxn−1≥0∀x∈(x1,+∞)The assumptiondnU(x)dxn>0∀x∈[x0,+∞)together with (2) implies thatdn−2U(x)dxn−2is strictly increasing and strictly convex ∀x ∈ [x1, +∞), implying in turn thatdn−2U(+∞)dxn−2=+∞. By Theorem 1 this implies∃x2:dn−2U(x)dxn−2>0∀x∈(x2,+∞). If n = 3 then this result together with (2) contradicts the assumption of bounded marginal utility, else if n > 3 then, by assuming x3 = max(x1, x2), this result together with (2) implies that the functiondn−3U(x)dxn−3is strictly increasing and strictly convex ∀x ∈ (x3, +∞), implying in turndn−3U(+∞)dxn−3=+∞. Repeating recursively previous steps we getdjU(+∞)dxj=+∞for j = n − 4, …, 1. The result for j = 1 contradicts the assumption of bounded marginal utility.□By using recursively Proposition 1 we get the following results:Proposition 2If ∃n > 2 such thatdnU(x)dxnis sign invariant ∀x ∈ [x0, +∞) then the derivatives of U(x) from order 2 to order n alternate in sign ∀x ∈ [x0, +∞).The proposition is proved using Proposition (1a) and (1 b) in alternation.□If ∃n > 1 such that(−1)n+1dnU(x)dxn>0∀x∈[x0,+∞)then(−1)j+1djU(x)dxj>0∀x∈[x0,+∞)for j = 2, …, n − 1.The proposition is proved using Proposition (1a) and (1 b) in alternation.□Proposition 3 shows that, given the usual assumptions of non-satiation, bounded marginal utility and unlimited domain of the utility function, if the condition that an even derivative is negative and an odd derivative is positive is satisfied for the nth-order derivative, then it is satisfied for all derivatives until order n.The class of utility functions exhibiting positive odd derivatives and negative even derivatives is important for certain economic issues and was specifically studied by Brockett and Golden (1987) and by Caballé and Pomansky (1996).66Other findings on these functions were also made by Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987).,77Note that, as in the present paper, these articles introduce the assumption that the domain of the utility function is unbounded.Proposition 3 provides a new result related to this class. Furthermore it is important for many applications as will be shown in next section.The results in Proposition 3 have clear implications for economic problems studying high-order risk changes.88This analysis generalises Menegatti’s (2014) results on increases in risk, in downside risk and in outer risk.In order to perform this analysis we briefly summarize usual definition and results on nth-order increase in risk. Following Eeckhoudt et al. (2009); Ekern (1980), consider two random variables y and z defined over the interval [0, b] where b ∈ R+. Assume that F and G denote the cumulative distribution functions for these random variables. Define F(0)(x) ≡ F(x) andF(j)(x)≡∫0xF(j−1)(t)dtfor j ≥ 1 and similarly define G(0)(x) and G(i)(x) for i ≥ 1. We now have that:Definition 1The random variable z is an nth-order increase in risk over the random variable y if F(k)(b) = G(k)(b) for k = 1, 2, …, n − 1 and F(n − 1)(x) ≤ G(n − 1)(x) ∀x ∈ [0, b].Given this framework the following lemma states the well-known relationship between nth-degree increase in risk and expected utility. In particular, following Eeckhoudt et al. (2009); Ekern (1980) we have:99For this presentation of the lemma see Eeckhoudt et al., 2009, p. 996.Lemma 1The following are equivalent: (a) z is an nth-degree increase in risk over y; (b) E[U(y)] ≥ E[U(z)] for every U(x) such that(−1)n+1dnU(x)dxn>0.Given these premises, we can now apply the results in Proposition 3 to the cases of nth-order risk change. For this purpose, consider a set of n − 1 pairs of generic risks labelled as (y2, z2),..., (yn, zn). Assume that znis a nth-order increase in risk over yn, zn − 1 is a n − 1th-order increase in risk over yn − 1 and so on until pair (y2, z2). Note that examples of pairs of risks of this kind can be obtained by means of a sequence of lotteries. For the construction procedure of lotteries of this kind see Denuit and Eeckhoudt (2010).Comparing these different sets of risks by using Lemma 1 and the results in Proposition 3 we obtain that:Proposition 4If, for an agent, ynis weakly preferred over znfor every possible pair1010The words “for every possible pair” mean for every pair in [0, b] and for every b in R+.(yn, zn) where znis a nth-order increase in risk over yn, then yn − 1 is weakly preferred over zn − 1 for every possible pair (yn − 1, zn − 1) where zn − 1 is n − 1th-order increase in risk over yn − 1, yn − 2 is weakly preferred over zn − 2 for every possible pair (yn − 2, zn − 2) where zn − 2 is n − 2th-order increase in risk over yn − 2 and so on until the pair (y2, z2).Lemma 1 proves that if for every possible pair (yn, zn) where znis a nth-order increase in risk over ynan agent weakly prefers ynto zn, then(−1)n+1dnU(x)dxn>0∀x∈R+. Proposition 3 proves that this ensures(−1)j+1djU(x)dxj>0∀x∈R+for j = 2, …, n − 1. Again by Lemma 1, this implies that yn − 1 is preferred over zn − 1, yn − 2 is preferred over zn − 2 and so on until the pair (y2, z2).□Proposition 4 shows that preferences on risk changes of different orders are not independent and provides a clear indication on the relationship between them. In particular we proved that if an agent dislikes every increase in risk of the generic order n than she will dislike every increase in risk of all orders from 2 to n.These results can be applied to different economic problems of choice under uncertainty, such as portfolio selection problems or precautionary saving models. Let us consider the case of precautionary saving. We introduce a simple two-period saving problem. An agent maximizes her lifetime utility given byV(s)=U(k0−s)+11+δE[U(k1+s(1+r))]where s is saving and k0 and k1 are respectively first-period and second-period income, r is the interest rate paid for saving or borrowing and δ the subjective intertemporal discount rate.Assume now that first-period income k0 is certain and second-period income k1 is random and that k1 can be represented alternatively by the two random variables y and z where z is an nth-order increase in risk over y. Given this framework and using Ekern (1980) results, Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2008) showed that:Lemma 2An increase of nth-order in risky income k1 (i.e. the case where income risk changes from y to z) determines a larger saving if and only if(−1)ndn+1U(x)dxn+1>0(i.e. if and only if the n + 1th-order derivative of the utility function is positive when n + 1 is odd and negative when n + 1 is even).1111Note that the word “larger” is used here in a weak sense to mean ” ≥ ”.Given this conclusion we can use Proposition 3 to obtain that:Proposition 5If an agent chooses a larger saving in case of every possible nth-order increase in risky income k1 (i.e. for every possible pair (y, z) where z is an nth-degree increase in risk over y) then she will also choose a larger saving in case of every possible increase in risky income of all orders from 2 to n.Lemma 2 proves that if every nth-order increase in risky income raises saving, then(−1)ndn+1U(x)dxn+1>0∀x∈[0,+∞). By Proposition 3 this ensures that(−1)j+1djU(x)dxj>0∀x∈[0,+∞)for j = 2, …, n − 1. Again by Lemma 2 this implies that saving increases for every increase in risky income of all orders from 2 to n.□The result in Proposition 5 has a very simple implication for precautionary saving theory: if the reaction to every nth-order increase in risk is a larger saving then the same reaction will occur for every risk change of all orders from 2 to n.
