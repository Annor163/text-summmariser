@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A Polycube is an orthogonal polyhedron (all the edges parallel to coordinate axes) that is a 3D manifold. A polycube parameterization is a bijective map between a 3D model and a polycube domain. The polycube domain shares the same topology with the model and approximates the geometry of the model. Hence, the polycube map can produce a seamless parameterization that has low metric distortions and regular atlas structure (i.e., each patch/part is a rectangle/cube). Such a parameterization is desirable in many geometric modeling and processing tasks such as spline construction  [1–3], meshing  [4–6], shape interpolation  [7], and texturing  [8]. This paper studies effective automatic polycube parameterization.High-quality hexahedral (simply denoted as hex in the following) mesh generation has received much attention in recent years. Tessellating the given solid model using high-quality hex meshes is desirable for effective finite element analysis or isogeometric analysis in structural mechanics, fluid dynamics simulations, etc. Polycube parameterization can be used for automatic hex mesh generation. The basic idea is as follows. For a given solid shapeM, whose boundary surface is denoted asS, first construct a polycube domainΩgeometrically similar toMand compute a mapϕ:Ω→M; then onΩ, construct a uniform hexahedral meshH, and transform it byϕ(H). The resultant hex meshϕ(H)conforms with the geometry ofMand has regular tessellation. The meshing quality is dictated by the parameterizationϕ. Ifϕhas smaller volume distortion, the resultant mesh is more uniform, and ifϕhas smaller angle distortion, the mesh elements are less sheared.Constructing a good polycube domain is critical in reducing mapping distortions. Earlier polycube parameterization methods built polycubes manually  [8,1], which can be labor-intensive and infeasible for complicated shapes. More recently, a few automatic polycube construction methods have been proposed  [9,5,6]. However, automatic, robust, yet effective polycube construction for general 3D models remains challenging (see Section  2). Specifically, a polycube domain having simpler structure and fewer corners usually provides a more desirable (e.g. fewer singularities in spline construction  [1] and mesh generation  [5,6]) parameterization. In contrast, composing a polycube domain via more subcubes may better approximate the original geometry and result in less distorted mapping. Hence, seeking an effective balance between these two aspects is important, but it was little explored.Main contributions. This work aims to design an automatic and robust polycube parameterization framework for general solid regions/objects. We propose a novel and automatic polycube construction and optimization algorithm that balances domain complexity and its geometry similarity to the given model. We then develop a mapping computation algorithm upon this polycube domain to obtain a low-distortion volumetric parameterization for the given solid region/object. Compared with existing polycube methods, we can generate mappings with smaller distortion. This computational framework can also serve as an automatic hexahedral meshing tool that produces high-quality hex meshes.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We develop an automatic and effective polycube parameterization pipeline for general 3D solid models. Our domain optimization can generate a desirable polycube balancing the domain simplicity and adequate resemblance to the input model. Upon this polycube, a volumetric parameterization with small distortion can be computed. This polycube parameterization usually does not have interior singularities and hence is desirable for many computer-aided design/engineering tasks such as spline construction. We show this parameterization’s application in high-quality hexahedral mesh generation for 3D solid geometric models.Limitations. First, our polycube construction and volumetric mapping are computed separately. Since the domain shape will affect the mapping distortion, solving them together may lead to a better parameterization. However, their simultaneous optimization is very expensive, especially when the topological structure (corner numbers) of the polycube domain needs to be modified during the optimization. A polycube surface domain optimization algorithm without changing polycube corner numbers was given in  [11], which is already expensive for surface parameterization and prohibitive in volumetric parameterization. Second, modeling complex feature curves is still challenging on volumetric polycube domains. A more sophisticated scheme and efficient mixed-integer optimization algorithms are needed. Third, hex meshes generated by polycube mapping may have big distortion near corners. Introducing interior singularities can reduce such distortion. Post-processing such as adaptive insertion of padding layers  [20] (by splitting highly sheared hex elements) or other general frame field and mapping optimization methods  [16–18] can be directly adopted upon our initial meshing results.
