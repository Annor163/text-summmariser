@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The physiological artifacts such as electromyogram (EMG) and electrooculogram (EOG) remain a major problem in electroencephalogram (EEG) research. A number of techniques are currently in use to remove these artifacts with the hope that the process does not unduly degrade the quality of the obscured EEG. In this paper, a new method has been proposed by combining two techniques: a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) followed by a stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to remove EMG artifacts and a second-order blind identification (SOBI) technique followed by SWT to remove EOG artifacts. The simulation results show that these combinations are more effective than either using the individual techniques alone or using other combinations of techniques. The quality of the artifact removal is evaluated by calculating correlations between processed and unprocessed data, and the practicability of the technique is judged by comparing execution times of the algorithms.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a convenient non-invasive tool to study activities in the human brain for diagnosis and research. Applications of EEG in diagnosis include neurological diagnosis [1], sleep disorder diagnosis [2] and drug action assessment [3]. EEG is also used in rehabilitation such as brain–computer interface (BCI) systems [4] and performance enhancement in studies ranging from sports sciences [5] to neurofeedback applications [6]. However, the magnitude of scalp EEG is usually in the range of 10–50μV and is quite weak as compared to other surrounding artifact signals.Among the artifact signals, electromyogram (EMG) and electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts easily obscure the EEG signal and make the analysis difficult. In the early days, the segments of EEG data containing artifacts were visually identified by experts and removed. This approach frequently left insufficient EEG data for analysis. This motivated research on artifact removal methods that remove the artifact components while retaining the desired EEG data. The artifact removal methods have been applied to the raw EEG data to remove or reduce the physiological artifacts such as EOG and EMG, because the advancement of EEG recording technologies has precluded most non-physiological artifacts to appear in the data.Most research on physiological artifacts removal focuses on EOG as it is more obvious, and the source of generation and propagation can be easily studied [7–16]. An effective method to remove EOG is the regression method where extra electrodes are used to detect the reference EOG to be subtracted from the corresponding channels. The usage of extra electrodes may not be desirable, and various attempts have been made to obtain the reference EOG using independent component analysis [13], wavelet transform [14], high-speed camera [15] as well as modeling of the components [16]. On the other hand, the usage of extra electrodes to detect reference EMG is ineffective due to the activation of multiple muscles involved in its generation.The artifact removal methods can be classified into two main approaches. The first approach attempts to remove artifacts from each channel of EEG data individually [15,17]. This approach is extremely useful for BCI applications and neurofeedback training where it is desirable to use fewer EEG electrodes. The most popular method, linear filtering, assumes that the artifacts and EEG signals have different frequency ranges. Unfortunately, comprehensive studies on EMG [18] and EOG [19] artifacts have shown that these artifacts overlapped with the conventional EEG frequency range. The application of wavelet transform and adaptive filters can be considered as an improvement over the linear filtering method. The wavelet transform decomposes the signal into multiple frequency bands, and the artifacts are assumed to have larger amplitudes in the respective frequency bands [20]. Adaptive filters, on the other hand, attempt to adaptively model the signal according to the changes in the signal [15]. Recently, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) which decomposes the signal into a number of amplitude and frequency modulated zero-mean signals was introduced in EEG artifact removal [21] with promising results.On the contrary, the second approach removes artifacts from multiple EEG channels collectively. This approach can be applied to remove artifacts from typical EEG recordings where multiple channels are acquired as in the standard International 10-20 or 10-10 system. The blind source separation (BSS) method extracts a set of source components from a set of mixed signals. The components that are associated with the artifact sources are manually identified and removed. Recently, various techniques for automatic detection of artifact components using support vector machine (SVM) [9,22], correlation [23] and spectral ratio [17] have been introduced. However, the component identified as artifact still contains EEG signal [24], and removing that component artificially enhances the coherence between different EEG channels [25].Attempts have been made to combine both approaches to increase their performance by using single channel decomposition (SCD) methods such as wavelet transform [12,25–29] or empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [30] with BSS methods. Although application of BSS followed by SCD is better in removing artifacts [20,25], the reverse order of application allows this combination to be applied on to an individual channel [21,30]. Artifact detection using non-linear parameters has been applied to further enhance the performance of the combination method [28].In this work, we have studied the effects of promising SCD artifact removal methods (wavelet transform and EMD) as well as BSS methods (SOBI and CCA) on EMG and EOG artifacts. Based on the outcome, we have proposed an artifact removal method that uses CCA-SWT for removing EMG artifacts and then automatically switches to SOBI-SWT for removing EOG artifacts. The proposed method is then applied on a set of actual EEG data to assess the efficiency in removing physiological artifacts.
