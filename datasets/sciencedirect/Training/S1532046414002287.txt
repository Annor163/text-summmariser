IntroductionPhysicians’ adoption seems to be a significant issue when comprehensive implementation of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) is considered. This study was conducted to determine the organizational contextual factors affecting physicians’ adoption of EMR.MethodsThis was a descriptive-analytical study in which a sample of 330 physicians working in hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences was selected. Physicians’ attitudes toward EMRs’ adoption have been assessed by a conceptual path model of Technology Acceptance model (TAM) and organizational context variables. Collected data were analyzed by SPSS16 using regression analysis. The final model was tested by structural equation modeling (SEM) and represented by SPSS–AMOS, structural equation modeling software.ResultsThe results suggest that modified proposed conceptual path model explains about 56% of the variance of EMRs’ adoption. The findings also evidenced that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), management support; physicians’ involvement, physicians’ autonomy, and the doctor–patient relationship have direct and significant effect on physicians’ attitudes toward EMRs’ adoption. However, training showed to have no significant effect on PU and PEOU.ConclusionThe present study acknowledged that considerable part of physicians’ attitude toward EMRs’ adoption is controlled by organizational contextual factors. These factors should be subsequently the major concern of health organizations and health policy makers.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) seems to be a significant issue when the comprehensive implementation of EMRs is taken into consideration [1–2]; accordingly, to have a thorough understanding of the advantages of EMRs, users’ adoption of EMRs should be included in the investigation.Although widespread of EMRs and its adoption by physicians and other health care providers are critical for the maintenance of patient care, the literature provides evidence for the failure of EMRs’ implementation due to lack of users’ adoption [1]. Recently, there has been a growing attempt to identify and predict human factors involved in the implementation process of technology. There are many organizational contextual factors affecting physicians’ attitude toward EMRs’ adoption which were examined in previous research studies [1,3–5]; however, the researchers have not found any study that identifies these factors in Iran.In order to address these factors at the organizational, group, and individual levels, this study incorporated contextual factors into the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a model which is based on the assumption that a user’s behavioral intention predicts actual use of the system. TAM is a prevalent theory of IT acceptance and is frequently used in health information technology (HIT) related studies conducted in clinical settings [6]. This model focuses exclusively on factors determining users’ behavioral intentions, known as perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) toward using a new computer technology [7]. On the basis of the model presented in Fig. 1H1–H9 were put forth and discussed in the following section.PU and PEOU, the two basic factors in TAM, have been found to control the end- users’ intention to use specific information systems [8–10] as presented in H1 and H2:H1PU is positively associated with physicians’ attitudes toward using and accepting EMRs.PEOU is positively associated with physicians’ attitudes toward using and accepting EMRs.Management support, adequate training, physicians’ involvement, physicians’ autonomy and the doctor–patient relationship; were the organizational contextual factors that have been analyzed in this study. These factors are commonly identified on the basis of literature review and prior empirical studies [1,3–5,11–12].As lack of organizational leadership or executive commitment can be detrimental to the successful implementation of a new clinical information system [1], the following hypotheses, H3 and H4, have been put forth:H3Management support is positively associated with PU.Management support is positively associated with POEU.In a user satisfaction study, Aaronson et al. [13] found that family practice residents’ perception of training adequately were correlated with perceived usefulness [13]. Gadd and Penrod [14] surveyed physicians for six month after EHRs implementation and found that 23% of them did not believe they had received adequate training [14]. Therefore, hypotheses, H5 and H6, have been presented as follows:H5Adequate training is positively associated with PU.Adequate training is positively associated with PEOU.Lorenzi and Riley [15] remarked that it was essential that physicians be treated as customers and that their needs be considered throughout the entire process of implementation [15]. Therefore, hypothesis H7 has been followed by this study:H7Physicians’ involvement is positively associated with PEOU.Implementation of EMRs involves substantial change, and a change of this magnitude may affect positions or power relations [15]. Consequently, when work roles, status and autonomy are adversely affected, resistance is likely to occur [1]. Hence, H8 has been put forth in this study:H8Physicians’ autonomy is positively associated with PEOU.Some studies have reported that physicians may perceive the use of a computer in the examination room as an obstacle, hindering workflow efficiency and disturbing patients [14,16–19]. Little research has been conducted in this area; however, doctor–patient relationship may be a determining factor on physicians’ attitude toward EMRs’ adoption. Thus, H9 has been put forth:H9Doctor–patient relationship is positively associated with PEOU.The purpose of this study was to determine the organizational contextual factors that may affect physicians’ acceptance of EMRs’ adoption. Fig. 1 summarizes hypotheses and presents the proposed a conceptual path model of TAM and organizational contextual factors.
