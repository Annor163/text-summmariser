IntroductionPLA2G7 encodes Lp-PLA2 having role in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques by catalyzing its substrate, phosphatydilcholine (PC), to be pro-inflammatory substances. The increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in Asian population has been related with this enzyme. 279Val→Phe variant was reported to have a protective role against CAD due to, in part, secretion defect or loss of enzymatic function. Therefore, We study folding kinetics and enzyme-substrate interaction in 279Val→Phe by using clinical and computational biology approach.MethodsPolymorphisms were detected by genotyping among 103 acute myocardial infarction patients and 37 controls. Folding Lp-PLA2 was simulated using GROMACS software by assessing helicity, hydrogen bond formation and stability. The interactions of Lp-PLA2 and its substrate were simulated using Pyrx software followed by molecular dynamics simulation using YASARA software.ResultPolymorphism of 279Val→Phe was represented by the change of nucleotide from G to T of 994th PLA2G7 gene. The folding simulation suggested a decreased percentage of α-helix, hydrogen bond formation, hydrogen bond stability and hydrophobicity in 279Val→Phe. The PC did not interact with active site of 279Val→Phe as paradoxically observed in 279 valine. 279Val→Phe polymorphism is likely to cause unstable binding to the substrate and decrease the enzymatic activity as observed in molecular dynamics simulations. The results of our computational biology study supported a protected effect of 279Val→Phe Polymorphism showed by the odd ratio for MI of 0.22 (CI 95% 0.035–1.37) in this study.Conclusion279Val→Phe Polymorphism of Lp-PLA2 may lead to decrease the enzymatic activity via changes of folding kinetics and recognition to its substrate.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), known as platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH), is an enzyme associated with cardiovascular disease. Formerly, this enzyme was thought to be a protective enzyme as this enzyme hydrolyzes PAF. However, recent studies weighted its role as pro-atherogenic role (Steen and O’Donoghue, 2013) as hydrolysis of oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL) by this enzyme yields potent inflammatory mediator, lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) and Nonesterified Fatty Acid (NEFA) (Ferguson et al., 2012). PLA2 hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine (PC), phospholipid contained in ox-LDL, yielding Lyso-PC (Gibellini and Smith, 2010; Gonçalves et al., 2012) . In association with disease, previous studies have shown that angina and atherosclerotic event were associated with Lp-PLA2 level (Liu et al., 2011; Gonçalves et al., 2012; Patil et al., 2007). Our previous study also showed that Lp-PLA2 activity was increased in subjects with acute myocard infarct (Wahjono et al., 2014).Lp-PLA2 is encoded by PLA2G7 gene having many variants; one of those is 279Val→Phe. This variant has been reported, in Japan and Korea, China, Taiwan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan (Liu et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006). Four percent of Japanese population having 279Val→Phe resulted in lost of Lp-PLA2 function (Samanta and Bahnson, 2008), whereas study conducted in Korea reported that odds ratio of coronary artery disease of subjects having 279Val→Phe was 0.8, suggesting its protective role (Jang et al., 2011). In addition to loss of its function, 279Val→Phe variant has a low level of serum Lp-PLA2, at least in part, possibly due to defect of Lp-PLA2 secretion (Ishihara et al., 2004). The low concentration of serum Lp-PLA2 in 279Val→Phe population is probably due to folding defect (Jang et al., 2006).Therefore, the aims of this study are to explore the effect of 279Val→Phe mutation on its folding kinetics and its enzymatic activity at molecular level.
