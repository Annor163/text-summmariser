@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The present research deals with bifurcation and vibration responses of a composite truncated conical shell with embedded single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) subjected to an external pressure and axial compression simultaneously. The distribution of reinforcements through the thickness of the shell is assumed to be either uniform or functionally graded. The equations of motion are established using Green–Lagrange type nonlinear kinematics within the framework of Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory. Linear membrane prebuckling analysis is conducted to extract the prebuckling deformations. The stability equations are derived by applying the adjacent equilibrium criterion to the prebuckling state of the conical shell. A semi-analytical solution on the basis of the trigonometric expansion through the circumferential direction along with the harmonic differential quadrature (HDQ) discretization in the meridional direction is developed. A series of comparison studies are carried out to assure the accuracy and the convergence of the HDQ method. The research indicates that the superb accuracy and efficiency of solutions with few grid points are attributed to the higher-order harmonic approximation function in the HDQ method. Parametric studies are also presented to investigate the influence of boundary conditions, semi-vertex angle of the cone, volume fraction and distribution of CNTs on stability and vibration characteristics of the truncated conical shell. The results show that both volume fraction and distribution of CNTs play a pivotal role in the natural frequencies, buckling mode and buckling loads of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been one of the main categories of advanced materials, and have drawn the attention of many scientists due to their exceptional thermo-mechanical and electrical properties. For instance, their Young’s moduli are superior to all carbon fibers with a value greater than 1 (TPa) and their density could be only 1.3 (g/cm3)  [1]. As a result of such fascinating and unique features, CNTs are selected as a promising candidate of reinforcements in composite structures. On the other side, functionally graded materials (FGMs) are also known as a new kind of composites with fascinating features. Unique features of FGMs and CNTs could be achieved together, for instance, through functionally graded distribution of CNTs in a media.Many analytical, numerical and experimental studies were conducted to explore constitutive models and mechanical properties of CNT/ polymer composites. For example, mechanical properties of single and multi-walled CNT reinforced composite were compared and reviewed by Coleman et al. [2]. Results indicated that the improvements in both dispersion and stress transfer of the composites with chemically modified nanotubes are achieved. Qian et al.  [3] conducted experimental studies to provide information on composite deformation mechanisms and interfacial bonding between the multi-walled nanotubes and polymer matrix. They found that reinforcement with only 1 wt% nanotubes results in 36%–42% increase in elastic modulus and25%increase in breaking stress. The constitutive models of nanotubes reinforced polymer composites were introduced by Odegard et al.  [4], using an equivalent continuum modeling approach. Griebel and Hamaekers  [5] conducted a numerical study on the basis of molecular dynamic (MD) concept to determine the elastic modulus of polymer-carbon nanotubes composites with embedded single-walled carbon nanotube. The results showed an excellent agreement with macroscopic rule of mixtures.CNT reinforced composite (CNTRC) is an advanced material, which could be embedded in beams, plates or shells as structural elements. For instance, a multiscale analysis of deflection and stress behavior of the CNTRC beam was studied by Wuite and Adali  [6]. Rafiee et al.  [7] presented an analytical closed form solution based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory along with von Karman type of geometrical nonlinearity to trace the thermal primary–secondary paths of an FG-CNTRC beam integrated with two identical piezoelectric layers. It was shown that the thermal bifurcation points could be enhanced through an appropriate distribution of CNTs across the beam thickness. Free vibration and buckling of nanocomposite Timoshenko beam with embedded single-walled CNT (SWCNTs) resting on Pasternak elastic foundation were studied by Yas and Samadi  [8] by employing generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method. They found that inserting CNTs into polymer matrix may result in an increase in the buckling strength. Shen and Xiang  [9] investigated thermal postbuckling characteristics of FG-CNTRC beams on the basis of third-order shear deformation theory along with two step perturbation method. Their numerical results indicated that response of the beam with non-symmetric distribution of CNTs with respect to mid-plane is nonlinear bending rather than bifurcation type of buckling.Vibration response of CNTRC plates was studied by Formica et al.  [10] by utilizing an equivalent continuum model that follows the Eshelby–Mori–Tanaka method. An analytical and numerical studies were presented by Arani et al.  [11] to determine optimal orientations of CNTs in order to achieve the highest critical load for different boundary conditions, as well as aspect ratios of the plates. Large amplitude vibration and mechanical buckling of FG-CNTRC plates subjected to various in-plane mechanical loads were analyzed by Lei et al.  [12,13] using the element-free kp-Ritz method. In their works, the effective material properties of the plates with embedded single-walled CNTs are determined in accordance with micromechanical models on the basis of either Eshelby–Mori–Tanaka or the extended rule of mixture. Their works were among the first to present a series of systematic and original studies on the application of the element-free kp-Ritz method to analyze the stability characteristics of FG-CNTRC plates. Rafiee et al.  [14] studied the dynamic stability of FG-CNTRC plates comprising of two piezoelectric layers at the top and bottom of the reinforced layer. The plate was assumed to be geometrically imperfect and subjected to thermal and electrical loads simultaneously. Their results indicated that the volume fraction of CNTs and their distribution have a noticeable effect on the stability domains. Liew and his colleagues  [15–17] initiated benchmark works on buckling analysis of FG-CNTRC skew plates resting on Pasternak elastic foundation using element-free IMLS-Ritz method. The first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) was used for formulation of the energy functional to take into consideration the effects of rotary inertia and transverse shear deformation.Postbuckling response of FG-CNTRC cylindrical panels subjected to axial compression was investigated by Liew et al.  [18] using the element-free approach. To get rid of shear locking for a thin cylindrical panel, the bending stiffness was calculated by a stabilized conforming nodal integration scheme, the membrane and also shear terms were determined through the direct nodal integration approach. Lei et al.  [19] conducted a numerical study using the element-free kp-Ritz method to analyze the dynamic stability of FG-CNTRC cylindrical panels. In their work, Bolotin approximation approach was applied to the Mathieu equations to determine the instability domains. In this work, they have addressed key challenges in dynamic stability of FG-CNTRC curved structures. Recently, Kiani and his colleagues  [20,21] studied the linear thermal and mechanical buckling of FG-CNTRC conical shell using Donnell shell theory and hybrid Fourier generalized differential quadrature method was used to solve the partial equations. Additional investigations on FG-CNTRC structures were also reported in the literature  [22–31].Despite all the above-mentioned literature, there is no work on structural responses of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell subjected to hydrostatic or combined axial and radial mechanical loads. However, truncated conical shells are known as one of the principle elements of aerospace and ship structures, pressure vessels and piping. For instance, in aerospace engineering truncated conical shells are used for aircraft and satellites, in ocean engineering, they are used for submarines and water-borne ballistic missiles. Besides, in civil engineering, the conical shells are frequently used in containment vessels in elevated water tanks. Consequently, the vibration and stability analysis of such components play an essential role in the safety and reliability of whole structures. Thus, further comprehensive studies are still indispensable for understanding the structural responses of FG-CNTRC conical shell under different kinds of loading.The present work analyzes buckling and free vibration of functionally graded CNT reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) truncated conical shell subjected to axial compression and external pressure simultaneously. Nonlinear equations of motion of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell are derived on the basis of Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory and Green–Lagrange geometrical nonlinearity via the extended Hamilton principle. Solutions for the prebuckling state are accomplished by means of proper simplifications and the stability loss equations are derived by means of the adjacent equilibrium criterion. A semi-analytical solution using Fourier expansion and the HDQ discretization is adopted to determine the natural frequencies, bifurcation points and buckled shape of the structure. The proposed solution procedure extremely alleviates the computational efforts and storage requirements. The main contribution of the present research is to apply HDQ method to explore the efficient application of CNTs for improving the structural responses of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell. It is found that both volume fraction and distribution of CNTs play crucial role in natural frequencies, bifurcation points and circumferential buckling mode of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell.As shown in Fig. 1A, a functionally graded CNT reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) truncated conical shell is considered in the cylindrical coordinate system(x,θ,z). The truncated conical shell is shown with the lengthL, thicknessh, end radiiR1<R2and semi-vertex angleα. It is assumed that the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell is subjected to axial compression and external pressure simultaneously as shown in Fig. 1B.The single walled CNT reinforcement is assumed to be distributed either uniformly (referred to as UD) or functionally graded through the thickness (referred to as FG). In this work the extended rule of mixtures is used to calculate the effective material properties of the two-phase nanocomposites, mixture of the CNTs and an isotropic polymer. The effective material properties could be written as  [32]E11=η1VCNE11CN+VmEmη2E22=VCNE22CN+VmEmη3G12=VCNG12CN+VmGm(1)ρ=ρCNVCN+ρmVmwhereE11CN,E22CN, andG12CNare the Young’s modulus and shear modulus of the SWCNTs, respectively. Moreover,Em, andGmstand for the corresponding properties of the polymer matrix. It is worthwhile mentioning that the coefficientsη1,η2, andη3are defined to account for the scale dependent material properties. In fact, these constants are determined by matching the effective properties of CNTRC obtained from the molecular dynamic (MD) simulations with those from the rule of mixtures  [33]. In addition, in Eq. (1),VCNandVmstand for the volume fraction of the CNTs and polymer matrix, which fulfills the condition(2)VCN+Vm=1.As shown in Fig. 2, five different types of distributions of the CNTs are considered. The mathematical expression of the CNTs volume fraction in each case is expressed as(3)VCN(z)={VCN∗UD2VCN∗(1−2∣z∣h)FG-O4VCN∗(∣z∣h)FG-XVCN∗(1+2zh)FG-VVCN∗(1−2zh)FG-Λ.In accordance with Fig. 2, for the FG-V case, the outer surface of the truncated conical shell is CNT-rich and the inner surface is free of the CNTs. For the FG-O case, the middle surface of the conical shell is CNT-rich, whereas for the FG-X case, the outer and the inner surfaces are CNT-rich. The effective Poisson’s ratio is not sensitive to location of the CNTs and could be determined as  [33](4)ν12=VCN∗ν12CN+Vmνm.For the first time the Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory is used here to scrutinize the structural responses of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell. According to the Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory, displacementsu1,u2, andu3of points at distancezfrom the mid-plane could be expressed in terms of the mid-plane displacement(u0,v0,w0)as [34]u1=u0+zϕu2=v0+zψ(5)u3=w0+zχwhereϕ=θˆ(1+ζˆ2)−ψˆϖ2ψ=ψˆ(1+ζˆ1)−θˆϖ1(6)χ≅ζˆ1+ζˆ2+ζˆ1ζˆ2−ϖ1ϖ2in additionζˆ1=1A1∂u0∂x+1A1A2∂A1∂θv0+w0ℜ1ϖ1=1A1∂v0∂x−1A1A2∂A1∂θu0θˆ=−1A1∂w0∂x+u0ℜ1ζˆ2=1A2∂v0∂θ+1A1A2∂A2∂xu0+w0ℜ2ϖ2=1A2∂u0∂θ−1A1A2∂A2∂xv0(7)ψˆ=−1A2∂w0∂θ+v0ℜ2whereℜ1andℜ2are the first and second principal radius of curvature. For the truncated conical shell we have(8)A1=1,A2=R(x),R(x)=R1+xsinα,ℜ1=∞,ℜ2=R(x)cosα.To express the displacement field of the truncated conical shell, Eqs. (6)–(8) are substituted into Eq. (5). By conducting some manipulations, the displacement field could be written asu1=u0+z(−∂w0∂x−1R(x)∂v0∂θ∂w0∂x−sinαR(x)u0∂w0∂x−cosαR(x)w0∂w0∂x+1R2(x)∂w0∂θ∂u0∂θ−sinαR2(x)v0∂w0∂θ−cosαR2(x)v0∂u0∂θ+sin2α2R2(x)v02)u2=v0+z(−1R(x)∂w0∂θ−1R(x)∂u0∂x∂w0∂θ+cosαR(x)v0{1+∂u0∂x}+1R(x)∂u0∂θ∂w0∂x−sinαR(x)v0∂w0∂x)(9)u3=w0+z(∂u0∂x+1R(x)∂v0∂θ+sinαR(x)u0+cosαR(x)w0+1R(x)∂v0∂θ∂u0∂x+sinαR(x)u0∂u0∂x+cosαR(x)w0∂u0∂x−1R(x)∂u0∂θ∂v0∂x+sinαR(x)v0∂v0∂x).The Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory incorporated with the Green–Lagrange geometrical nonlinearity, when applied to the truncated conical shell, yields the strain fields and may be written asϵxx=ϵx0+zκxϵθθ=ϵθ0+zκθ(10)γxθ=γxθ0+zκxθ.It should be noted that more details about application of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor are given in  [35–47]. After some mathematical simplifications by retaining only the main nonlinear terms, the strain–displacement relations can be expressed asϵx0=∂u0∂x+12[(∂u0∂x)2+(∂v0∂x)2+(∂w0∂x)2]ϵθ0=1R(x)∂v0∂θ+sinαR(x)u0+cosαR(x)w0+12[(1R(x)∂u0∂θ−sinαR(x)v0)2+(1R(x)∂v0∂θ+sinαR(x)u0+cosαR(x)w0)2+(1R(x)∂w0∂θ−cosαR(x)v0)2]γxθ0=∂v0∂x+(1R(x)∂u0∂θ−sinαR(x)v0)(1+∂u0∂x)+∂v0∂x(1R(x)∂v0∂θ+sinαR(x)u0+cosαR(x)w0)+∂w0∂x(1R(x)∂w0∂θ−cosαR(x)v0)κx=−∂2w0∂x2κθ=cosαR(x)(∂u0∂x+1R(x)∂v0∂θ)−sinαR(x)∂w0∂x−1R2(x)∂2w0∂θ2(11)κxθ=−cosαR2(x)∂u0∂θ+cosαR(x)∂v0∂x+2sinαR2(x)∂w0∂θ+2R(x)∂2w0∂x∂θ.It should be noted that more details on mathematical simplifications are given in  [34].The elastic constitutive relations of FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell in a plane state of stress are(12){σxxσθθτxθ}=[Q11Q12Q16Q21Q22Q26Q61Q62Q66]{ϵxxϵθθγxθ}where[Qij]represents the transformed reduced stiffness matrix and its coefficients are determined as(13)Q11=E111−ν12ν21,Q12=ν12E111−ν12ν21,Q22=E221−ν12ν21,Q66=G12.In addition, the stress resultantsNijandMijare defined as(14){NxxNθθNxθ}=∫−h2h2{σxxσθθτxθ}dz{MxxMθθMxθ}=∫−h2h2z{σxxσθθτxθ}dz.Furthermore, stress resultants in terms of mid-plane characteristics are obtained by substitution of Eqs. (10)–(13) into Eq. (14)(15){NxxNθθNxθMxxMθθMxθ}=[A11A12A16B11B12B16A12A22A26B12B22B26A16A26A66B16B26B66B11B12B16D11D12D16B12B22B26D12D22D26B16B26B66D16D26D66]{ϵx0ϵθ0γxθ0κxκθκxθ}where, stretching, stretching–bending coupling and bending stiffness parametersAij,Bij, andDijare determined as(16)(Aij,Bij,Dij)=∫−h2h2(Qij,zQij,z2Qij)dz.The static version of virtual displacements is a common principle utilized to obtain the complete set of governing equations and associated boundary conditions. According to this principle, the total virtual potential energy of structures vanishes in an equilibrium state. The principle of the virtual displacement is(17)δ(U+V)=0whereδUis the virtual strain energy of the shell and may be calculated as(18)δU=∫0L∫02π∫−h2h2(σxxδϵxx+σθθδϵθθ+τxθδγxθ)(1+zℜ2)R(x)dzdθdxandδVis the virtual potential energy of the external loads and could be obtained as follows(19)δV=∫0L∫02π[(q22+P2πR(x))δu0−q1δw0](1+zℜ2)R(x)dθdxwhenq1=q2=qH, the external pressure turns into a hydrostatic pressure and whenq2=0,q1=qL, the external pressure turns into a lateral pressure. Moreover,Prepresents the axial compressive load.Integrating Eqs.  (18)–(19) with respect to the corresponding coordinate and performing the Green–Gauss theorem to relieve the virtual displacement gradients results in the three equilibrium equations asδu0:Nxx,x+sinαR(x)Nxx+sinαR(x)Nxxu0,x+(Nxxu0,x),x−sinαR(x)Nθθ+1R2(x)(Nθθu0,θ),θ−sinαR2(x)(Nθθv0),θ−sin2αR2(x)Nθθu0−sinαR2(x)Nθθv0,θ−sin2α2R2(x)Nθθw0+1R(x)Nxθ,θ+1R(x)(Nxθu0,x),θ+1R(x)(Nxθu0,θ),x−sinαR(x)(Nxθv0),x−sinαR(x)Nxθv0,x+cosαR(x)Mθθ,x−cosαR2(x)Mxθ,θ=0δv0:sinαR(x)Nxxv0,x+(Nxxv0,x),x+1R(x)Nθθ,θ−sin2αR2(x)Nθθv0+sinαR2(x)Nθθu0,θ+1R2(x)(Nθθv0,θ),θ+sinαR2(x)(Nθθu0),θ+cosαR2(x)(Nθθw0),θ−cos2αR2(x)Nθθv0+cosαR2(x)Nθθw0,θ+2sinαR(x)Nxθ+Nxθ,x+sinαR(x)Nxθu0,x+1R(x)(Nxθv0,θ),x+1R(x)(Nxθv0,x),θ+sinαR(x)(Nxθu0),x+cosαR(x)(Nxθw0),x+cosαR2(x)Mθθ,θ+cosαR(x)Mxθ,x=0(20)δw0:sinαR(x)Nxxw0,x+(Nxxw0,x),x−cosαR(x)Nθθ−cos2αR2(x)Nθθw0−cosαR2(x)Nθθv0,θ−sin2α2R2(x)Nθθu0+1R2(x)(Nθθw0,θ),θ−cosαR2(x)(Nθθv0),θ−cosαR(x)Nxθ+1R(x)Nxθ,xw0,θ+1R(x)(Nxθw0,x),θ+1R(x)Nxθw0,xθ−cosαR(x)(Nxθ,xv0),x+Mxx,xx+2sinαR(x)Mxx,x−sinαR(x)Mθθ,x+1R2(x)Mθθ,θθ+2sinαR2(x)Mxθ,θ−2R(x)Mxθ,xθ+q1=0.Complete set of the boundary conditions is extracted through the process of virtual displacement relieving. The boundary conditions of the two ends of the conical shell(i.e.x=0,x=L)are(R(x)Nxx+R(x)Nxxu0,x+Nxθu0,θ−Nxθsinαv0+Mθθcosα)δu0=0(R(x)Nxxv0,x+R(x)Nxθ+Nxθv0,θ+Nxθsinαu0+Nxθcosαw0+Mxθcosα)δv0=0(21)(Nxθw0,θ−Nxθcosαv0+R(x)Mxx,x+Mxxsinα+R(x)Nxxw0,x−Mθθsinα−2Mxθ,θ)δw0=0.The conical shells illustrate the transverse deflection at the beginning of mechanical loadings. Thus, bending deformation exists in both the prebuckling and postbuckling regimes as opposed to plate-like structures, which remain un-deflected in the prebuckling state. It is noteworthy that the presence of the lateral deformation in the prebuckling regime makes the stability characteristics of the conical shells more complicated with nonlinear prebuckling path. To obtain simple solutions for design purposes, the prebuckling path is commonly linearized. In this regard, Brush  [48] examined the influence of prebuckling rotations on the stability loss conditions and concluded that for cylindrical shells under uniform pressure, when the ratio of the length to the mean radius is greater than unity, the included error is within 5% by neglecting the prebuckling rotations. Furthermore, as theLRincreases, the error reduces permanently. In addition, in the analysis of linear thermal stability of shape memory alloy (SMA) fiber reinforced composite cylindrical shell, Asadi et al.  [49] reported a maximum of3%deviation from those reported by Patel et al.  [50] based on the nonlinear equilibrium analysis. Therefore, for moderately long class of shells, the linear membrane prebuckling assumption results in an error, which may be neglected for design applications.Deformation of the FG-CNTRC conical shell in the prebuckling regime is symmetric. Thus, the symmetrical linear case of equilibrium equations are adequate to analyze the prebuckling deformation. It should be noted that in axisymmetric membrane prebuckling deformations, all of the moments and curvatures are dropped out of the symmetric linearized equations. Consequently, only the first and third equations remain, which result inNxx,x0+sinαR(x)(Nxx0−Nθθ0)=0(22)cosαR(x)Nθθ0−q1=0where superscript ‘0’ indicated the prebuckling characteristic. After some mathematical manipulations  [49], the prebuckling force resultants of the conical shell are obtained asNxx0=−q2R(x)2cosα−P2πR(x)cosαNθθ0=q1R(x)cosα(23)Nxθ0=0.The stability equations of the FG-CNTRC conical shell could be derived through the adjacent equilibrium criterion  [51]. To achieve this aim, a perturbed equilibrium position from a prebuckling state is considered. An equilibrium position in prebuckling state is defined with components(u00,v00,w00). With arbitrary perturbation(u01,v01,w01)conical shell experiences a new equilibrium configuration adjacent to the primary one described with displacement components(u00+u01,v00+v01,w00+w01). Linear stress resultants in adjacent configuration are obtained as the sum of stress resultants in prebuckling state and perturbed stress resultants induced due to the incremental displacement field. The stability equations are developed asδu0:Nxx,x1+sinαR(x)Nxx1+sinαR(x)Nxx0u0,x1+(Nxx0u0,x1),x−sinαR(x)Nθθ1+1R2(x)(Nθθ0u0,θ1),θ−sinαR2(x)(Nθθ0v01),θ−sin2αR2(x)Nθθ0u01−sinαR2(x)Nθθ0v0,θ1−sin2α2R2(x)Nθθ0w01+1R(x)Nxθ,θ1+cosαR(x)Mθθ,x1−cosαR2(x)Mxθ,θ1=0δv0:sinαR(x)Nxx0v0,x1+(Nxx0v0,x1),x+1R(x)Nθθ,θ1−sin2αR2(x)Nθθ0v01+sinαR2(x)Nθθ0u0,θ1+1R2(x)(Nθθ0v0,θ1),θ+sinαR2(x)(Nθθ0u01),θ+cosαR2(x)(Nθθ0w01),θ−cos2αR2(x)Nθθ0v01+cosαR2(x)Nθθ0w0,θ1+2sinαR(x)Nxθ1+Nxθ,x1+cosαR2(x)Mθθ,θ1+cosαR(x)Mxθ,x1=0(24)δw0:sinαR(x)Nxx0w0,x1+(Nxx0w0,x1),x−cosαR(x)Nθθ1−cos2αR2(x)Nθθ0w01−cosαR2(x)Nθθ0v0,θ1−sin2α2R2(x)Nθθ0u01+1R2(x)(Nθθ0w0,θ1),θ−cosαR2(x)(Nθθ0v01),θ−cosαR(x)Nxθ1+Mxx,xx1+2sinαR(x)Mxx,x1−sinαR(x)Mθθ,x1+1R2(x)Mθθ,θθ1+2sinαR2(x)Mxθ,θ1−2R(x)Mxθ,xθ1=0where in the above equation,(),xand(),θstand for the derivatives with respect to thexandθdirections, respectively. In the present work, two types of movable boundary conditions are considered for each end of the conical shell. Each end of the shell could be either clamped(C)or simply supported(S). The mathematical expressions for each edge support areC:v01=w01=w0,x1=(R(x)Nxx+R(x)Nxxu0,x+Nxθu0,θ−Nxθsinαv0+Mθθcosα)=0(25)S:v01=w01=Mxx1=(R(x)Nxx+R(x)Nxxu0,x+Nxθu0,θ−Nxθsinαv0+Mθθcosα)=0The equations of motion of the FG-CNTRC conical shell are derived using the Hamilton principle based on the Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory. According to this concept, an equilibrium position in the structure occurs when the following condition is satisfied(26)∫t1t2(δU+δV−δT)dt=0where the virtual strain energy(δU)could be computed using Eq. (18), and virtual potential energy of the external forces(δV)is absent for the free vibration analysis. In addition,δTis the virtual kinetic energy of the conical shell and could be determined as(27)δT=∫0L∫02π∫−h2h2ρ(z)(u̇0δu̇0+v̇0δv̇0+ẇ0δẇ0)(1+zℜ2)R(x)dzdθdx.Here, a(̇)indicates the derivative with respect to timet. After some mathematical manipulations, performing Green–Gauss theorem to relieve the virtual displacement gradients results in the following equations of motionδu0:Nxx,x+sinαR(x)Nxx+sinαR(x)Nxxu0,x+(Nxxu0,x),x−sinαR(x)Nθθ+1R2(x)(Nθθu0,θ),θ−sinαR2(x)(Nθθv0),θ−sin2αR2(x)Nθθu0−sinαR2(x)Nθθv0,θ−sin2α2R2(x)Nθθw0+1R(x)Nxθ,θ+1R(x)(Nxθu0,x),θ+1R(x)(Nxθu0,θ),x−sinαR(x)(Nxθv0),x−sinαR(x)Nxθv0,x+cosαR(x)Mθθ,x−cosαR2(x)Mxθ,θ=I0ü0+I1ẅ0,xδv0:sinαR(x)Nxxv0,x+(Nxxv0,x),x+1R(x)Nθθ,θ−sin2αR2(x)Nθθv0+sinαR2(x)Nθθu0,θ+1R2(x)(Nθθv0,θ),θ+sinαR2(x)(Nθθu0),θ+cosαR2(x)(Nθθw0),θ−cos2αR2(x)Nθθv0+cosαR2(x)Nθθw0,θ+2sinαR(x)Nxθ+Nxθ,x+sinαR(x)Nxθu0,x+1R(x)(Nxθv0,x),θ+sinαR(x)(Nxθu0),x+cosαR(x)(Nxθw0),x+cosαR2(x)Mθθ,θ+cosαR(x)Mxθ,x=(I0+2cosαR(x)I1+cos2αR2(x)I2)v̈0−(1R(x)I1+cosαR2(x)I2)ẅ0,θ(28)δw0:sinαR(x)Nxxw0,x+(Nxxw0,x),x−cosαR(x)Nθθ−cos2αR2(x)Nθθw0−cosαR2(x)Nθθv0,θ−sin2α2R2(x)Nθθu0+1R2(x)(Nθθw0,θ),θ−cosαR2(x)(Nθθv0),θ−cosαR(x)Nxθ+1R(x)Nxθ,xw0,θ+1R(x)(Nxθw0,x),θ+1R(x)Nxθw0,xθ−cosαR(x)(Nxθ,xv0),x+Mxx,xx+2sinαR(x)Mxx,x−sinαR(x)Mθθ,x+1R2(x)Mθθ,θθ+2sinαR2(x)Mxθ,θ−2R(x)Mxθ,xθ=I1sinαR(x)ü0+I1ü0,x+(I11R(x)+I2cosαR2(x))v̈0,θ−I2sinαR(x)ẅ0,x−I2ẅ0,xx−I21R2(x)ẅ0,θθ+I0ẅ0whereIiare the inertia terms and defined as(29)Ii=∫−h2h2ρ(z)zidzi=0,1,2.In seeking an alternate numerical method using fewer grid points to obtain results with sufficient accuracy, the differential quadrature method (DQM) was introduced by Bellman et al.  [52,53]. The DQM is a global approximate method, which is based on the ideas that the derivative of a function with respect to a coordinate could be expressed as a weighted linear sum of all the function values at all grid points and the continuous function could be approximated by a higher-order polynomial in the overall domain. There are two differences between DQM and finite element method (FEM). Firstly, the FEM uses lower-order polynomials to approximate a function on a local element. In contrast, the DQM approximates a function on the global area using higher-order polynomials. Secondly, the DQM directly approximates the derivatives of a function at a point, while the FEM approximates a function over a local element and the derivatives can then derived from the approximate function. Thus, owing to the higher-order polynomial approximation in the DQM, it usually requires fewer grid points as compared to the FEM or FDM, thus very little computational costs and virtual storage are needed when DQM is employed.In this work, the HDQ method is used to solve the governing differential equations in the spatial domain. According to the HDQ method, the FG-CNTRC conical shell is discretized intoKpoints in thexdirection. Based on the HDQ method, theξth-order derivation of functionw(x)at any discrete point could be calculated approximately as(30)dξw(xi)dxξ≈∑j=1Kℵij(ξ)w(xj)wherexiis a discrete point in the solution domain,w(xj)is the function value at pointxjandℵij(ξ)is the weighting coefficients for theξth-order derivation of the function in thexdirection.The weighting coefficients could be calculated through the functional approximations in thexdirection. Utilizing harmonic functions as the approximating test functions in the quadrature method to handle with periodic problems, results in explicit terms for the weighting coefficients for HDQ.  [54–56]. Moreover, employing harmonic functions instead of polynomial as the test function results in circumventing the limitation for the number of grid point in the conventional DQM based on the polynomial test function.The harmonic test functionħk(x)employed in this work is(31)ħk(x)=sin((x−x0)π2)…sin((x−xk−1)π2)sin((x−xk+1)π2)…sin((x−xK)π2)sin((xk−x0)π2)…sin((xk−xk−1)π2)sin((xk−xk+1)π2)…sin((xk−xK)π2).According to the HDQ, the weighting coefficients of the first-order derivativesℵij(1)fori≠jcould be determined as(32)ℵij(1)=π2Γ(xi)Γ(xj)sin((xi−xj)π2)where(33)Γ(xi)=∏j=1,j≠iKsin((xi−xj)π2).The weighting coefficients of the second-order derivativesℵij(2)fori≠jcould be determined by the following formula(34)ℵij(2)=ℵij(1){2ℵij(1)−πcot((xi−xj)π2)},i,j=1,…,K.The weighting coefficients of the first and second-order derivativesℵii(r)fori=jare(35)ℵii(r)=∑j=1,j≠iKℵij(r)r=1or2and fori=1,…,K.In accordance with theℵij(1)andℵij(2), the weighting coefficients of the third and fourth-order derivatives could be calculated asℵij(3)=∑k=1Kℵij(1)ℵij(2)(36)ℵij(4)=∑k=1Kℵij(2)ℵij(2).It is worth mentioning that in the above equations, no limitation on the choice of grid points is found and still the method gives simple algebraic expression. Also, much computational time is saved when the weighting coefficients are determined by these formulations.Several choices for the sampling point positions could be considered. It is shown that in most cases, some unequally spaced points may result in faster convergence of the solution and more accurate results. In this regard, the Chebyshev grid points are the most efficient in all existing grid spacings for some cases, although it may be not optimal grid spacings. In this work, discrete points based on the zeros of the Chebyshev polynomial are selected in order to generate nonuniform grids as(37)xi=L2[1−cos((i−1)π(K−1))]fori=1,2,…,K.Before applying the HDQ method, considering the periodicity conditions of the conical shell in circumferential direction, and absence of the prebuckling forceNxθ0, the following solution is assumed, which fulfills the circumferential constraints of the conical shellu01(x,θ)=U(x)sin(nθ)v01(x,θ)=V(x)cos(nθ)(38)w01(x,θ)=W(x)sin(nθ)wherenis the full-wave length in circumferential direction. Substituting Eq. (38) into Eq. (24) and utilizing the HDQ discretization for thex-dependent functions, and after performing some mathematical manipulations, the following system of equations is established(39)([[KEUU][KEUV][KEUW][KEVU][KEVV][KEVW][KEWU][KEWV][KEWW]]−[[KGUU][KGUV][KGUW][KGVU][KGVV][KGVW][KGWU][KGWV][KGWW]]){{U}{V}{W}}={{0}{0}{0}}where[KE]is the elastic stiffness matrix, which contains the unknown circumferential full-wave length numbern. In addition,[KG]is the geometric matrix, which contains the mechanical loading parameters. To determine the critical buckling load of the conical shell, starting fromn=1, the full-wave number of the conical shell is assumed to be prescribed. The established homogeneous system of equations is solved via the standard eigenvalue approach. The minimum positive eigenvalue is associated to the critical buckling load of the FG-CNTRC conical shell with prescribed wave numberndenoted byPCrn. It should be pointed out that a convergence study is necessary to compute the required number of grid point. In this paper, the solution procedure by means of the HDQ method is implemented in a MATHEMATICA code.The modal shapes for a vibrating truncated conical shell are expressed as a product of unknown functions in the meridional direction and known trigonometric functions along the circumferential direction. The following expression of the separation of variables that fulfills the boundary conditions and is also compatible with the equations of motion (Eq. (28)), is providedu0(x,θ,t)=eiωtU(x)sin(nθ)v0(x,θ,t)=eiωtV(x)cos(nθ)(40)w0(x,θ,t)=eiωtW(x)sin(nθ).The time-dependency of the admissible functions (Eq. (40)) is selected to overcome the periodicity condition of variables field in the time domain. Also, in these functionsωis the natural frequency of FG-CNTRC conical shell. After substituting Eq. (40) into Eq. (28) and utilizing the HDQ discretization for thex-dependent functions, and after performing some mathematical manipulations, the following system of equations is established(41)([[KEUU][KEUV][KEUW][KEVU][KEVV][KEVW][KEWU][KEWV][KEWW]]−ω2[[MUU][MUV][MUW][MVU][MVV][MVW][MWU][MWV][MWW]]){{U}{V}{W}}={{0}{0}{0}}.By solving the above eigenvalue problem, the natural frequencies of the FG-CNTRC conical shell could be determined. In this research, the solution procedure by means of the HDQ method is implemented in a MATHEMATICA code.In this section, in addition to examine the effect of the volume fraction and distribution of CNTs on the free vibration and buckling of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell, we also evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of solutions with few grid points by the higher-order harmonic approximation function in the HDQ method. First, a fast rate of convergence of the presented formulation and solution procedure for determining buckling load and natural frequencies of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell is conducted. Moreover, several comparison studies are performed to ensure the efficacy and validity of the developed solution procedure. Then, a series of parametric studies are carried out to elaborate the effect of the various involved parameters on the buckling and free vibration characteristics of the FG-CNTRC conical shell. The material properties and CNT efficiency parametersηi(i=1,2,3)are defined as [25]E11CN=5.6466TPa,E22CN=7.0822TPa,G12CN=1.9445TPa,ρCN=1400kg/m3,ν12CN=0.175,Em=2.5GPa,ρm=1150kg/m3,νm=0.34{η1=0.137,η2=1.022,η3=0.715,ifVCN∗=0.12η1=0.142,η2=1.626,η3=1.138,ifVCN∗=0.17η1=0.141,η2=1.585,η3=1.109,ifVCN∗=0.28.Furthermore, it is assumed thatG13=G12andG23=1.2G12.To determine the efficiency of the HDQ method, critical buckling load of the FG-CNTRC conical shell under pure external pressure with arbitrary edge supports and semi-vertex angle is addressed in Table 1. As can be seen, whenK=19, the desired accuracy is achieved, since bothK=17andK=19obtain the same results. As a result, in this work, for all results, the number of grid points is selected asK=19. Thus, in the present work, the number of degrees of freedom is equal to 57 for all results.To verify the accuracy of the present formulation and solution procedure, several comparative studies are addressed in Tables 2–3 and Fig. 3.To this end, critical buckling load and natural frequencies of the isotropic conical shell with simply supported boundary conditions are listed in Tables 2 and 3. In the Table 2, the non-dimensional critical buckling load of the isotropic truncated conical shell under pure axial compression is compared with those obtained by  [57–60].In Table 3, the first eight natural frequencies of the isotropic conical shell are compared with those reported by [61–63].In addition, Fig. 3, shows the efficiency and accuracy of proposed approach for buckling pressure of a moderately thick CNTRC-conical shell subjected to pure external pressure. The numerical results are compared with those presented in  [20]. A brief review of these comparative studies confirms the efficiency and accuracy of the present model and method. The maximum discrepancy of less than 2% is observed between the current numerical results and those published in the literature.It is noteworthy that results of  [20] are obtained based on the Donnell shell theory along with the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT). However, results of this study are obtained based on the Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory in which the effect of the shear deformation is neglected. These comparative studies clearly prove the accuracy of Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory for moderately thick structures without considering the effect of the transverse shear deformation. As a result, the established assumption in this study is valid and yields the reasonable justification.To estimate the computational efficiency of the proposed solution procedure, the CPU time and CPU usage of the proposed method are compared with those of the FEM. The finite element analysis (FEA) is performed using ABAQUS 6.11 software. A simply supported isotropic cylindrical shell under external pressure is modeled in ABQUS software using the eight node doubly-curved rectangle elements (S8R) with six degrees of freedom at each node. It is noteworthy that predictions of the FEM are highly dependent on mesh sizes. In order to preserve the accuracy of the results, the mesh size may further refined depending on geometrical parameters of the cylindrical shell. Static buckling analysis is done by a standard ABAQUS procedures. In Table 4, the CPU time and usage of the HDQ method to calculate the critical buckling pressure of the isotropic cylindrical shell are compared with the CPU time and usage of the FEM. A review of this table reveals that the computational effort and virtual storage of the proposed method are significantly less than the FEM. As can be seen, each HDQ result takes less than 2 s computer running time, while the minimum computer running time for FEM is about 21 min. The main reason is that the accurate HDQ results could be obtained using a considerably small number of grid points, thus the computational time is minimal. Hence, the proposed solution procedure is significantly efficient from the computational point of view.To assess the influence of CNTs volume fraction, distribution of CNTs, boundary condition, geometrical parameters and types of loading on the bifurcation point, natural frequencies and mode shape of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell, a series of parametric studies are given in this section.To illustrate the effect of the semi vertex angle and volume fraction of CNTs on the critical buckling load of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell under pure axial compression, variation of the critical buckling load versus the semi vertex angle is depicted in Fig. 4. As shown in this figure, increasing the volume fraction of CNTs results in a drastic increase in the critical buckling load of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell. For example, an increase of CNTs volume fraction from 0.12 to 0.28 leads to a noticeable increase of the critical buckling load by a factor of about 1.1. Furthermore, it is visible that by increasing the semi vertex angle from0∘to90∘, not only the onset of the buckling decreases but also the buckling configuration may change accordingly. For instance, for the case ofVCN∗=0.28, increasing the semi vertex angle from0∘to80∘results in94%decrease in the onset of buckling and the circumferential buckling mode shape changing from 4 to 2.To expatiate on the effect of loading types on the onset of buckling and buckling configuration, variation of the critical buckling load versus the semi vertex angle is illustrated in Fig. 5. Comparing Figs. 4, 5A and 5B, one can find that the onset of the buckling and the circumferential mode number is completely sensitive to the loading types. In fact, the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell under pure axial compression has the most buckling load and the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell under combined axial compression and hydrostatic pressure has the least buckling load. For instance, the critical buckling load of the FG-X CNTRC conical shell withVCN∗=0.28under pure axial compression is 15.2 times higher than FG-X CNTRC conical shell under pure hydrostatic pressure and, 31 times higher than FG-X CNTRC conical shell under combined axial compression and hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore, circumferential mode number of the FG-CNTRC conical shell under external pressure is higher than FG-CNTRC conical shell under pure axial compression.To expatiate on the influence of edge supports on the onset of buckling and buckling configuration, the buckling pressure of a moderately thin FG-V CNTRC truncated conical shell subjected to combined axial compression and hydrostatic pressure is demonstrated in Fig. 6for both CC and SS boundary conditions. As expected, the conical shell with CC edge support has the higher buckling pressure than the conical shell with SS boundary condition, owing to the higher flexural rigidity of the clamping condition. As can be seen, with increasing the ratio ofβ, the critical buckling pressure substantially reduces, thus the onset of buckling is more sensitive to hydrostatic pressure than axial compression. Furthermore, the effect of edge support is critical in short conical shells, since the edge zone near the boundary conditions becomes more dominant. A study on the circumferential mode number reveals that a short conical shell with stiffer edge supports buckles in higher number of waves. The reason is that the clamped edge support has a high local flexural as compared to the simply supported edge support. For example, atβ=5, the circumferential mode number for clamped condition is 10, while for conical shell with simply supported condition, the circumferential mode number is 8. In addition, as the ratio ofβincreases, the circumferential mode number at the buckling state decreases correspondingly.Fig. 7shows the variation of the onset of the buckling versus the semi vertex angle of the FG-CNTRC conical shell under combined axial compression and hydrostatic pressure. Five types of CNT distributions are taken into consideration. It is concluded that, the FG-X CNTRC conical shell has the most buckling pressure and the FG-O CNTRC conical shell has the least buckling pressure. The reason for this observation is that the onset of the buckling is dependent on bending stiffness(D11−B112A11). For the case that the outer surface of the conical shell is CNT-rich, the bending stiffness is higher than the case that inner surface is CNTs rich. Thus, locating the CNTs in the outer surface is more influential than the inner surface in postponement of the onset of the buckling. In addition, distributions of CNTs may change the circumferential buckling mode shape of the FG-CNTRC conical shell. For instance, at the line (A), which is shown in Fig. 7, circumferential mode number is 6 for all five types of CNT distributions. At point (B), the circumferential mode number of the FG-Λchanges from 6 to 5 as opposed to other types of CNT distributions in which the circumferential mode number is still 6. Again, at the line (C), which is shown in Fig. 7, circumferential mode number is 5 for all five types of CNT distributions. At point (D), the circumferential mode number of the FG-Λchanges from 5 to 4 as opposed to other types of CNT distributions in which the circumferential mode number is still 5.The variations of the critical buckling pressure of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell against the length-to-mean radius ratio, as one of the important geometrical parameters, for different volume fractions of CNTs and different types of loading are illustrated in Fig. 8. It is evident from the figure that the length-to-mean radius ratio has a considerable effect not only on the onset of the buckling but also on the circumferential mode number at the buckling state. For instance, for the case FG-CNTRC conical shell withVCN∗=0.28under combined axial compression and hydrostatic pressure, increasing the length-to-mean radius ratio from 1 to 5, results in 88% decrease in the critical buckling pressure, and the circumferential mode number changes from 8 to 6. Moreover, it is visible that the influence of the length-to-mean radius ratio on the buckling configuration is more profound when the FG-CNTRC conical is subjected to pure axial compression. In addition, a study on the number of full wave through the circumferential direction reveals that the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell under combined axial compression and hydrostatic pressure buckles in a higher number of waves.The variations of the critical buckling pressure of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell versus the mean radius-to-thickness ratio, as one of the pivotal geometrical parameters, for different CNT volume fractions, distributions of CNT and different types of loading are depicted in Fig. 9. As can be seen, by increasing the mean radius-to-thickness ratio, the critical buckling pressure declines significantly, because of the higher flexural rigidity of the FG-CNTRC conical shell due to the decrease in the shell mean radius. It is concluded from the figure that the circumferential buckling mode shape change is more sensitive to geometrical parameters. For instance, increasing the mean radius-to-thickness ratio from 50 to 200, results in a change of the circumferential mode number from 6 to 10. In addition, the difference between five different types of CNT distributions or difference between different CNT volume fractions is more profound in thick truncated conical shells. For instance, whenRh=50the difference between the critical buckling pressure of the FG-O and FG-X distributions is about 47%, while this difference is less than 15% whenRh=200. In addition, the difference between the onset of the buckling of the FG-V CNTRC truncated conical shell withVCN∗=0.12andVCN∗=0.28is about 115% whenRh=50, but whenRh=200, showing a difference of less than 40%.Some buckled configuration of the FG-X CNTRC truncated conical shell as shown in Fig. 9A, are illustrated in Fig. 10for different mean radius-to-thickness ratios.The influence of CNT volume fractions and distributions of CNT on the variation of the first three non-dimensional frequencies of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell versus the semi vertex angle is demonstrated in Fig. 11. It is clear from the figures that both the volume fraction and distribution of CNTs have a noticeable effect on the natural frequencies of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell. However, its influence depends on the semi vertex angle of the conical shell. In fact, CNTs volume fraction has a profound effect on the non-dimensional natural frequencies for small values of the semi vertex angle. The frequencies decrease monotonically as the semi vertex angle increases. It is interesting to note that in harmonic excitation, when frequency of excitation increases for the semi vertex angle is less than 70°, the third mode of the circumferential vibration of the UD-CNTRC truncated conical shell is excited prior to the first and second mode. While for the semi vertex angle between 70° and 80°, the second mode of the circumferential vibration is excited and when the semi vertex angle is higher than 80°, the first mode becomes dominant. Thus, at 70° and 80° the third and second, the second and first circumferential modes of vibration are superimposed, respectively. Furthermore, as the semi vertex angle reaches to 90°, the frequencies converge to approximately one value. This phenomenon may be explained by the fact that the conical shell degenerates to a circular plate when semi vertex angle is 90°.Fig. 12depicts the variations of the natural frequencies versus the variable ratio of length-to-mean radius of the FG-V CNTRC conical shell with different volume fractions. For the case ofn=2andn=3, the influence of the length-to-mean radius ratio on the natural frequencies can be neglected. While, length to mean radius ratio has a significant effect on the natural frequency of the FG-V CNTRC conical shell whenn=1.The effect of some influential parameters, including the volume fraction of CNTs, the length-to-mean radius and the semi vertex angle on the variations of the natural frequency versus the circumferential mode(n)is addressed in Fig. 13. As can be seen from Fig. 13a and c, the influence of the CNTs volume fraction and the semi vertex angle is observed to be more noticeable at higher circumferential mode numbers. In contrast, the effect of length-to-mean radius is more pronounced at lower circumferential mode numbers. It is interesting to mention that none of these parameters may affect the circumferential mode number associated with the fundamental frequency.The variations of the fundamental frequency parameter of the FG-X CNTRC conical shell versus the mean radius-to-thickness ratio are presented in Fig. 14for different CNT volume fractions and distributions. As one may state, by increasing the mean radius-to-thickness ratio, the fundamental frequency parameter decreases substantially. In addition, the variation of the fundamental frequency parameter is smooth and almost the same in all cases under considerations. Of possible further interest is that the effect of CNTs distribution on the fundamental frequency of the FG-CNTRC conical shells is more pronounced when the mean radius-to-thickness ratio decreases. In addition, as the mean radius-to-thickness ratio increases, the circumferential mode number associated with the fundamental frequency increases and as previously noted in Fig. 13, the circumferential mode number associated with the fundamental frequency is independent of both the distribution and volume fraction of CNTs. Moreover, it is found that the maximum efficiency of CNTs occurs when the outer surface of the conical shell is CNT-rich (either FG-X or FG-V) and the minimum efficiency of CNTs happens when the inner surface of the conical shell is CNT-rich (either FG-O or FG-Λ).In this paper, the stability and vibrational behaviors of FG-CNTRC conical shells under combined axial compressive load and hydrostatic pressure are investigated based on the Green–Lagrange type nonlinear kinematics within the framework of Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory. The scale effect of CNT reinforcement is taken into account by using the efficiency parameter. A semi-analytical solution on the basis of the trigonometric function expansion through the circumferential direction and the HDQ method, as an efficient and accurate numerical method, is utilized to discretize the governing equations through the meridian direction. Fast rate of convergence of the method is illustrated and its high accuracy with less computational costs is demonstrated by comparing the results with literature. The parametric studies are carried out to investigate the effects of boundary conditions, loading types, semi vertex angle, length-to-radius ratio, radius-to-thickness ratio, distribution of CNTs and CNTs volume fraction. It is found that all geometrical parameters play an essential role in buckling pressure, buckling configuration and natural frequencies. It is found that fundamental frequency is not generally associated with the circumferential mode number one(n=1), and geometrical parameters play a major role in circumferential mode number associated with the fundamental natural frequency of the FG-CNTRC conical shells. It is shown that the circumferential mode number associated with the fundamental natural frequency is independent of the CNTs volume fraction and distribution as opposed to stability characteristics in which volume fraction and distribution of CNTs may change the buckling configuration. The numerical results reveal that the maximum efficiency of CNT reinforcement in enhancing the structural responses of the FG-CNTRC conical shell occurs when the outer surface of the conical shell is CNT-rich, whereas the minimum efficiency of CNTs happens when the inner surface of the conical shell is CNT-rich. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed method is to obtain accurate results with a rather few grid points. Our studies show that the proposed solution procedure is effective in reducing the computational efforts and storage requirements.
