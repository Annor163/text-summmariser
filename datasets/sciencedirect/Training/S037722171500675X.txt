@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The complexity of evaluating chance constraints makes chance-constrained programming problem difficult to solve. One way to handle this complexity is by devising satisficing measures for the relevant uncertainties. This paper focuses on solving the stochastic vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) by Satisficing Measure Approach (SMA) that mitigates the dissatisfaction experienced by the customers. Satisficing measures are first proposed for the VRPTW with stochastic demand on various distributions to demonstrate the dependency of customers’ satisfaction towards lack of inventory based on the vehicle's capacity. Similar satisficing measures are extended to VRPTW with stochastic travel times. We integrate the proposed satisficing measures into an existing tabu-search heuristics to solve a set of generalized Solomon instances in a short amount of computation time. Compared with best-known results, the SMA saves the effort to design recourse actions, applicable to many popular probability distributions and produces very competitive results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The static and deterministic vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) deals with the situation where all the input data such as demands and travel times are known in advance. In a practical distribution network, many events can occur and perturb initial plans (Delage, 2010). Due to the uncertainty in customer demand and vehicle travel time, delays are experienced by customers. However, big delays that occur in a priori routing plan are disruptive and lead to poor quality of service. This paper focuses on the context of a stochastic VRPTW, where the customer demand or vehicle travel time is unknown before realization. Solutions to the stochastic VRPTW include a priori routing plans, which assign customers to vehicles and sequence customers in the routes. The goal of this paper is to solve the stochastic VRPTW by a Satisficing Measure Approach (SMA) that mitigates the dissatisfaction experienced by the customers. As the stochastic VRPTW can be complicated with various settings, this paper only contributes to the literature under the static assumption, that is, the information about customers and vehicles is known, and all the decisions must be made prior to the commencement of distribution.The study of stochastic vehicle routing problem (SVRP) has gained in popularity in recent years and much progress has been made towards understanding the structure of these problems and the computational behavior of related algorithms (Gendreau, Laporte, & Séguin, 1996a). The vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (VRPSD) is one of the well-known problems in SVRP. The first main contribution to the VRPSD considers the problem involving more than one depot with Poisson distributed demands (Tillman, 1969). The next significant contribution on the VRPSD is made on a chance constrained model and two penalty models (Golden & Stewart, 1978). Dror and Trudeau highlight the asymmetric nature of distance costs (Dror & Trudeau, 1986), contributing to another important milestone in the VRPSD literature. Nevertheless, a major contribution to the study of VRPSD is in Bertsimas (1988) which derives several bounds, asymptotic results and other theoretical properties. In subsequent studies (Gendreau, Laporte, & Séguin, 1995; Laporte & Louveaux, 1993; Laporte, Louveaux, & Mercure, 1989; Laporte, Louveaux, & Van Hamme, 2002), an integer L-shaped method is developed. A tabu search heuristic is used to solve a stochastic vehicle routing problem where customers are present with some probability and have random demands (Gendreau, Laporte, & Séguin, 1996b). More recent papers on the problem include Haugland, Ho, and Laporte (2007), Mendoza, Castanier, Guéret, Medaglia, and Velasco (2010), Rei, Gendreau, and Soriano (2010), and Secomandi and Margot (2009).In the vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic demands (VRPTWSD), each customer has an associated time window. In the event of route failure, the time windows of the remaining customers on the planned route may be violated because of the time spent by the vehicle returning to the depot and resuming its work. The available related literature on the VRPTWSD is limited. A chance constrained model is used to solve a vehicle routing and scheduling problem with time windows and stochastic demands (Ong, Ang, Goh, & Deng, 1997). A stochastic recourse model is applied to a vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic demands (Chang, 2005), in which the computation of the expected recourse cost is an extension of that of Gendreau et al. (1995). The integer L-shaped method is applied to develop a heuristic for the problem. But this heuristic is only tested on the Solomon's C101 instance (Solomon, 1987) excluding the vertex demands and the vehicle capacity, and vertices are arbitrarily assigned one of the three demand types in approximately equal proportions. Recently, the VRPTWSD is modeled as a stochastic program with recourse and an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is proposed for its solution (Lei, Laporte, & Guo, 2011). Computational results show the superiority of the proposed heuristic over an alternative solution approach.Other than stochastic demands, stochastic travel times comprise another set of uncertainty in the SVRP. The first model that explicitly considers the vehicle routing problem with stochastic travel times (VRPST) is presented in 1992 (Laporte, Louveaux, & Mercure, 1992). In this model, the vehicles are incapacitated, and chance-constrained formulation and stochastic program with simple recourse are proposed. A branch-and-cut approach is used to solve instances on networks with 10–20 nodes and 2–5 scenarios. Kenyon and Morton also focus on the vehicle routing problem with stochastic travel and service times (Kenyon & Morton, 2003). They develop a solution procedure by inserting a branch-and-cut algorithm into a Monte Carlo solution approach to solve large-sized problems effectively. The VRPST is studied to consider travel times resulting from a stochastic process due to traffic congestion (Van Woensel, Kerbache, Peremans, & Vandaele, 2008). The developed queueing models are solved by means of a tabu search metaheuristic.The VRPTW with stochastic travel times (VRPTWST) is introduced more recently. A two-stage stochastic integer program with recourse is proposed for a problem in which travel times are stochastic and each customer has an associated time window (Wong, Leung, & Cheng, 2003). Ando and Taniguchi consider the VRPTW with uncertain travel times and solve it with a genetic algorithm (Ando & Taniguchi, 2006). Russell and Urban also study the VRPTW where the travel times are random variables with a known probability distribution (Russell & Urban, 2007). The number of vehicles used and the total distance travelled are minimized along with the penalties that appear because of the arrivals outside the time windows. Zheng and Liu propose a chance-constrained programming model for the VRPTW with fuzzy traveling times, and use a hybrid approach including fuzzy simulation and genetic algorithm (Zheng & Liu, 2006). The VRPTW with stochastic travel and service times is studied by Li, Tian and Leung, and two formulations based on stochastic programming are proposed (Li, Tian, & Leung, 2010). A heuristic algorithm based on tabu search is developed to obtain the results effectively. But they find no feasible solutions to their chance-constrained programming model, and conclude that the chance-constrained programming model is harder to solve than stochastic programming model with recourse. Recently, a robust optimization approach has been proposed and used to solve small instances for the VRPTWSD (Agra et al., 2013).In order to improve the service quality in a distribution network, the unexpected behavior of random variables needs to be characterized. One commonly used service quality measure for describing this unexpected behavior is recourse cost. The random behavior of customer demands or travel times could cause an expected feasible solution to become infeasible. This situation is referred to as “route failure”, and when it occurs, some corrective actions can be introduced to obtain a new feasible solution. If the route's accumulated demand at any customer exceeds the actual vehicle capacity, the associated vehicle might be forced to return to the depot in order to reload and resume the distribution at the last visited customer. Recourse cost calculates the additional cost for recourse actions to fix the route failures. However, recourse cost depends highly on strong assumptions of recourse actions.Another commonly used service quality measure is the probabilistic measure, which is usually the possibility of demands exceeding vehicles’ capacity or arrival times exceeding customers’ due times over assumed distributions. The probabilistic measures are usually included in chance constraints, which force the probability of unexpected behavior to be below a specific threshold (Branda, 2012, 2013; Shapiro, Dentcheva, & Ruszczynski, 2009). The computational intractability of the probabilistic measures arises due to lack of convexity. There are three cases in the computation of the probability (Bianchi, Dorigo, Gambardella, & Gutjahr, 2009): a) closed-form expressions are available; b) ad hoc and fast approximation of the probability are designed and used during optimization; c) the probability is estimated by simulation. Typically, closed-form expressions are not available. The design of ad hoc approximation is strongly problem dependent, and no general rule exists for finding efficient approximations. The simulation is a time-consuming process which is undesirable. For example, in local search algorithms such as tabu search, it is crucial to be able to evaluate the neighbourhood of a solution efficiently.In many models, the aim is to maximize the success probability in the objective function. But, one of the drawbacks of maximizing only the success probability is that it assumes indifference to the level of losses and gains. It does not address how catastrophic losses could be (or how exceptional gains could be) when extreme (i.e., low probability) events occur. A number of studies have in fact suggested that it is not the case to be completely insensitive to such magnitude variations, particularly with respect to losses (Payne, Laughhunn, & Crum, 1980). More recently, it has been argued that a model which solely maximizes the success probability is too crude to be normatively or descriptively relevant (Diecidue & Van de Ven, 2008).Thus, the dissatisfaction on service lateness may not be proportional to the amount of lateness in the VRPTW with stochastic travel time. Customers may become more impatient when the service is delayed until a later time. Hence, it is necessary to establish a new service quality measure which could in some extent reflect real attitudes towards delays and in particular, could account for the degree of dissatisfaction over the threshold.Here, satisficing measures are derived to evaluate the dissatisfaction of customers for insufficient vehicle inventory or later arrival time than due time. The concept of aspiration levels from satisficing has been utilized as a means of quantifying the desirability of investment opportunities with uncertain payoffs (Brown & Sim, 2009). In particular, Brown and Sim aim to provide a framework for measuring the quality of risky positions with respect to their ability to satisfy (i.e., achieve the aspiration level). A more general class of measures, called satisficing measures, is axiomatized. Probabilistic measures are one special case of satisficing measures. It is also shown that satisficing measures have a dual connection to risk measures. In addition, the quasi-concavity property is important computationally, as it readily admits the use of efficient algorithms for optimization over satisficing measures. Their framework does not rely in any way on the axioms of utility theory. Though the primary focus is on a model useful for financial positions, the framework readily applies to other settings in which risk is an important issue.To fully address the stochastic VRPTW, this paper firstly proposes satisficing measures to demonstrate the dependency of customers’ satisfaction towards the delay process based on their corresponding acceptable level. This acceptable level is the assigned vehicle's capacity level or due time of time window. The satisficing measures are developed on various specific or general distributions, and can be computed faster than the normal probability index. Then, a SMA is introduced by applying the satisficing measures within an existing tabu-search heuristics for the VRPTW. Finally, experiments are performed on a set of generalized Solomon instances to evaluate the quality of the solutions obtained by the proposed SMA.Our paper has several important contributions to the field of stochastic vehicle routing. First, our SMA can be defined for many popular distributions, including the ambiguous distribution with support and mean support. Our approach, with minimal change in the methodology and implementation, can be easily adopted to solve both VRPTW with stochastic demand and VRPTW with stochastic travel time. Secondly, our heuristics produce competitive results in a short amount of computational time. In fact, we obtain better solutions than the existing literature, while the superior speed is due to the computational tractability of the SMA: it can be reduced to solving a one-dimensional convex minimization problem.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the satisficing measures and the SMA are proposed for the VRPTWSD. In Section 3, we extend the SMA to solve the VRPTWST. In Section 4, we report the performance and the promising results of the SMA when it is integrated into a tabu-search heuristics. Finally, Section 5 concludes with several managerial insights.We define in this section the satisficing measure for the VRPTWSD. The main difficulty associated with VRPTWSD lies in the computation of the recourse cost. This cost, incurred any time a vehicle fails to satisfy a customer's demand, consists of additional distance travelled to the depot and then back to the customer, and the cost of late services as the vehicle may arrive late to the subsequent customers in the route. Methods to compute the recourse cost often rely on simulation or making extra assumptions about the probability distributions to have an analytical expression for the cost. To get around this difficulty, our proposed measure penalizes the route's failure indirectly by penalizing the negative excessive inventory, defined as the difference between the vehicle's capacity and the route's aggregate demand. We then show that our measure is tractable: it can be reduced to solving a univariate convex minimization problem. Based on the characteristics of this measure, it can be used as a cost component, or as an approximation of the chance constraint, or both at the same time. We show later in the numerical studies that although the SMA does not take into account the recourse cost directly, our solutions still have very low recourse cost.The VRPTWSD is defined on a complete directed graphG=(V,E), whereV={0,1,…,n}is the vertex set, andE={(i,j):i,j∈V,i≠j}is the edge set. Vertex 0 is a depot at which m identical vehicles with capacity C are based, while the remaining vertices represent customers. A distancecij=c(i,j)is defined on each edge of E, and the distances are symmetriccij=cji. It is assumed that the travel times are equal to the distances,tij=cij. A service time siis incurred when visiting a vertex i. Each vertex i has a time window [ei, hi] that represents the earliest and due time when the service to customer i starts. If a vehicle arrives earlier than eiat customer i, it is required to wait until time ei. Each vertex i is also associated with a nonnegative and stochastic demandd˜ito be collected. The stochastic demands can be split and unknown until vehicles arrive at the customers. As a result, failure may occur along a route if the total collected demand exceeds the vehicle capacity.We adopt a factor-based model in which the demand for each customer can be written as an affine combination of some primitive uncertain factorsz˜k,k=1,2,…,Kwhere K is the number of uncertain factors. For example, the stochastic demand can depend onz˜ks representing the market conditions (product prices as well as conditions of complements and substitutes), customers’ preferences and tastes as well as the weather. More specifically, for each customer i, the stochastic demandd˜iis factored asd˜i=di0+∑k∈Kdikz˜k.Furthermore, it is assumed that any twoz˜ks are mutually independent, and the true probability distribution ofz˜klies in a family of distributionsFk. When there is exact information about the true distribution ofz˜k, for example,z˜kfollows a Poisson distribution, thenFkis a singleton, which is the true distribution itself. The case of ambiguous distributions whereFkcontains all probability distributions with known support and known mean support is also of particular interest. More specifically,Fkcan be characterized asFk={Pk:Pk(z˜k∈[z̲k,z¯k])=1,EPk[z˜k]∈[μ̲k,μ¯k]}.Given a route r which serves a set of customersIr={i:iisservedbyrouter}. By definingdk=∑i∈Irdik, the aggregate demand of this route isd˜r=∑i∈Ird˜i=∑i∈Irdi0+∑k∈K(∑i∈Irdik)z˜k=d0+∑k∈Kdkz˜k.We assume that the vehicles are fully loaded to its capacity C when it leaves the depot. The amount of excessive inventoryx˜, the difference between the vehicle capacity C and the aggregate demand of the route isx˜=C−∑i∈Ird˜i=C−d0−∑k∈Kdkz˜k.Depending on the distribution of the relevantz˜k,x˜has either a specific probability distribution, or an ambiguous distribution belonging to the familyF. For example, ifz˜kfollows a Poisson distribution, thenx˜also has a Poisson distribution. Whenx˜≥0, the vehicle can satisfy the demand of the customers, and the vehicle will return to the depot with a non-negative inventory level. Ifx˜<0, the route's aggregate demand exceeds the vehicle's capacity, the vehicle fails to satisfy all customers assigned to it. Next, we define the satisficing measure which penalizes the negative values ofx˜.Definition 1Given the excessive inventoryx˜satisfyinginfP∈FEP[x˜]>0andsupP∈FP(x˜<0)>0, the satisficing measure is a function defined byρ(x˜)Δ=sup{β:infa>0{1alnsupP∈FEP[exp(−ax˜)]−1aln(1−β)}≤0}.Note thatρ(x˜)=0ifinfP∈FEP[x˜]≤0;ρ(x˜)=1ifsupP∈FP(x˜<0)=0. It is important to note thatρ(x˜)is a coherent satisficing measure according to the definitions by Brown and Sim (2009). Several properties of this satisficing measure are listed below.Proposition 2The satisficing measureρ(x˜)has the following propertiesa.0<ρ(x˜)<1.Ifx˜≥y˜, thenρ(x˜)≥ρ(y˜).ρ(x˜)≤P(x˜≥0)for allP∈F.The proposition follows the definition of the measure in Brown and Sim (2009) so the proof will be omitted. Decision makers would prefer a lower probability of route failure, i.e., a higherx˜, and according to property (b) of Proposition 2, a higherx˜leads to a higherρ(x˜). Property (c) suggests that our satisficing measure is a lower bound for the probabilityP(x˜≥0), which is the probability that vehicle satisfies the customers’ demand with its capacity C. With this property, our measure can be used to approximate a chance constraint, and can be implemented as a constraint in the optimization model. This characteristic is strongly related to the conservative, convex approximation of chance constraints proposed by Nemirovski and Shapiro (2006). The calculation process ofρ(x˜)is proposed in Theorem 3.Theorem 3Letz˜be a vector with its elementsz˜k,k=1,2,…,K.ρ(x˜)can be computed asρ(x˜)=1−eψ(z˜),whereψ(z˜)=infa>0∑k∈KlnsupPk∈FkEP[exp(adkz˜k)]−a(C−d0).One of the advantages of using the satisficing measure is the tractability of finding the value forρ(x˜). According to Nemirovski and Shapiro (2006), which considers a computationally intractable chance constrained problem and constructs a general class of convex conservative approximations of the corresponding chance constrained problem,ψ(z˜)is actually a convex optimization problem with respect to the variable a. The tractability ofρ(x˜)depends on the complexity of evaluating the termlnsupPk∈FkE[exp(adkz˜k)]. In the next theorem, the termlnsupPk∈FkE[exp(adkz˜k)]is characterized for different distributions ofz˜k. When the distribution ofz˜kis known,Fkis a singleton and the operatorsupPk∈Fkwill be omitted.Theorem 4a.Ifz˜kfollows a Poisson distribution with parameter λk, thenlnE[exp(adkz˜k)]=λk(eadk−1).Ifz˜kfollows a Gamma distribution with shape αk and scale θk, thenlnE[exp(adkz˜k)]=−αkln(1−adkθk).Ifz˜kfollows a discrete Uniform distribution with support [lk, uk], thenlnE[exp(adkz˜k)]=ln[exp(alkdk)−exp(a(1+uk)dk)]−ln(uk−lk+1)−ln(1−eadk).Ifz˜kfollows a Normal distribution with mean μk and standard deviation σk, thenlnE[exp(adkz˜k)]=adkμk+12a2(dk)2σk2.Ifz˜kfollows an ambiguous distribution with known support and known mean support, that is:Fk={Pk:Pk(z˜k∈[z̲k,z¯k])=1,EPk[z˜k]∈[μ̲k,μ¯k]}.ThenlnsupPk∈FkE[exp(adkz˜k)]={In(z¯k−μ̲k)exp(adkz̲k)+(μ̲k−z̲k)exp(adkz¯k)z¯k−z̲k,whendk<0,In(z¯k−μ¯k)exp(adkz̲k)+(μ¯k−z̲k)exp(adkz¯k)z¯k−z̲k,whendk≥0.In general, there is no analytical solution forψ(z˜). The value ofρ(x˜)can be found by solving numerically a convex optimization problem using the results from Theorem 4. Fortunately, under certain assumptions, there are compact analytical expressions forψ(z˜). The assumptions are made such that the demand for each customer is independent and it can be modelled more concisely as follows:d˜i=di0+z˜i,wherez˜i,i=1,2,…,nare the primitive uncertainty factors. Under this assumption, the number of primitive uncertainty factors equals to the number of customers. As before, with Irbeing the set of customers being served by the route r andd0=∑i∈Irdi0,x˜can be simplified as:x˜=C−∑i∈Ird˜i=C−d0−∑i∈Irz˜i.In the next theorem, the analytical expression forψ(z˜)is provided under two common distributions forz˜i.Theorem 5a.When eachz˜ifollows a Poisson distribution with parameter λi,ψ(z˜)=(C−d0)(1−ln(C−d0)+ln∑i∈Irλi)−∑i∈Irλi.When eachz˜ifollows a Gamma distribution with shape αi and scale θ,ψ(z˜)=−(∑i∈Irαi)(lnθ+ln(∑i∈Irαi)−ln(C−d0))−C−d0θ+∑i∈Irαi.There is no straightforward method to obtain the analytical results forψ(z˜)when eachz˜ifollows the ambiguous distribution since the expression forlnsupPi∈FiE[exp(az˜i)]is still very complicated. Nevertheless, a method is proposed to characterize the distribution of the sum and the scalar-multiplicative of the uncertainty factor in the next lemma.Lemma 6When eachz˜ifollows an ambiguous distributionFi={Pi:Pi(z˜i∈[z̲i,z¯i])=1,EPi[z˜i]∈[μ̲i,μ¯i]},then for every real number t,tz˜ifollows an ambiguous distribution of familyFtFt={P:P(tz˜i∈[tz̲i,tz¯i])=1,E[tz˜k]∈[tμ̲i,tμ¯i]},andz˜=z˜i+z˜jfollows an ambiguous distributionF={P:P(z˜∈[z̲i+z̲j,z¯i+z¯j])=1,EP[z˜]∈[μ̲i+μ̲j,μ¯i+μ¯j]}.Following this lemma, the family of distributions of the sum of independent ambiguous distribution has the support and the mean support equal to the corresponding sum of the support and mean support of the uncertainty factors. So when eachz˜ifollows the ambiguous distribution, we havex˜=C−∑i∈Ird˜i=C−∑i∈Irdi0−∑i∈Irz˜i=C−d0−z˜with the true distribution ofz˜belonging to the following family of probability distributionsF={P:P(z˜∈[∑i∈Irz̲i,∑i∈Irz¯i])=1,E[z˜]∈[∑i∈Irμ̲i,∑i∈Irμ¯i]}.Furthermore, the satisficing measure associated with this value ofx˜is:ρ(x˜)Δ=sup{β:infa>0{1alnsupP∈FEP[exp(−ax˜)]−1aln(1−β)}≤0}=1−eψ(z˜),whereψ(z˜)=infa>0{lnsupP∈FEP[exp(az˜)]−a(C−d0)}.The value ofψ(z˜)can be computed by the following theorem.Theorem 7Whenz˜follows an ambiguous distribution,F={P:P(z˜∈[z̲,z¯])=1,E[z˜]∈[μ̲,μ¯]},Using these theorems, the satisficing measure can be computed for each route. The overall satisficing measure of the routing plan can be defined as the sum of the individual satisficing measures for each route.Definition 8Consider a routing plan of m routes in which for each router,r=1,…,m, the excessive inventory isx˜r. The overall satisficing measure for the routing plan is defined byρ=∑r=1mρ(x˜r),Since the decision maker prefers a higher ρ, ρ is used as a criterion to evaluate the performance of the routing plan. There are, however, many different ways to define ρ, for example, by taking a weighted average instead of taking the simple summation. One drawback of taking a weighted average is that the decision maker needs to give a weight to each route, which is not an intuitive and trivial task. Thus, we choose the simplest form of aggregation possible so that the model is not complicated by unnecessary technical details.In this section, the SMA is extended to solve the VRPTW with stochastic travel time. The VRPTWST can be defined in a similar manner as the VRPTWSD except that the customer demand diis now deterministic while each edge is associated with a stochastic travel timet˜ij. The stochastic travel times are unknown until the vehicles traverse the edges.The ready time of each customer is a strict requirement: when the vehicle arrives at the customer before the ready time, the vehicle is required to wait until the ready time. The due time, however, is a soft requirement. It is difficult to have a strict constraint on the due time since the travel time is uncertain and there is no possible guarantee that the vehicle can surely arrive before the due time.As in Section 2, analytical results of the satisficing measure are preferred so that they can be efficiently integrated into the heuristics. For this reason, we concentrate on the case when the travelling time between any two customers is independent. More specifically, the travelling time from customer i to customer j is modeled as a random variablet˜ijwith the true probability distribution belonging to the set:Fij={P:P(z˜ij∈[z̲ij,z¯ij])=1,E[z˜ij]∈[μ̲ij,μ¯ij]}.The main difficulty of the VRPTWST is to determine the distribution of the arrival time at the customer. Consider an example shown in Fig. 1, and lett˜ibe the arrival time at customer i. The arrival time at customer j,t˜j, can be calculated ast˜j=max{ei,t˜i}+si+t˜ij,where siis the service time and eiis the ready time of customer i. Even though the exact probability distribution may be known fort˜iandt˜ij, it is unlikely that the distribution oft˜jis known because of the maximum operator in the expression. Most existing methods use simulation in order to overcome this difficulty. In this paper, we calculate the safe approximation oft˜jast˜j≥max{ei,t˜i}+si+t˜ij.If we use this safe approximation, we can also safely approximatemax{ei,t˜i}using the following lemma.Lemma 9Whent˜ifollows an ambiguous distribution withFi={P:P(t˜i∈[t̲i,t¯i])=1,E[t˜i]∈[μ̲i,μ¯i]},thenT˜≥max{ei,t˜i}also follows an ambiguous distribution defined byFT={P:P(T˜∈[g1(ei,t̲i),g2(ei,t¯i)])=1,E[T˜]∈[g1(ei,μ̲i),g2(ei,μ¯i)]},where g1,g2are real-valued functions as defined below:g1(e,t)={t,e<t,e,e≥t.g2(e,t)={t,e<t,e+ϵ,e≥t.This lemma applies a piecewise linear transformation on the support and the mean support oft˜ito get the distribution ofT˜, which is an upper approximation ofmax{ei,t˜i}. The plot of the function g1(e, ·) is given in Fig. 2. This piecewise linear transformation conforms with the distributionally robust optimization framework since after the transformation, the travel time is shifted towards higher values. A similar idea has been previously proposed to transform the mean and variance of the distribution (Jula, Dessouky, & Ioannou, 2006).Note that the function g2 needs an additional small positive termϵto keepT˜as a random variable. For a quick demonstration of the importance of this term, consider for example whent˜ihas the ambiguous distributionFi={P:P(t˜i∈[5,10])=1,E[t˜i]∈[6,8]},andei=9. If there is no termϵ, thenT˜=max{ei,t˜i}has the distributionFT={P:P(T˜∈[9,10])=1,E[T˜]=9},which meansT˜=9, orT˜becomes deterministic. However, with the positive termϵ, thenT˜is still a random variable with the distribution familyFT={P:P(T˜∈[9,10])=1,E[T˜]∈[9,9+ϵ]}.From the assumption about the distribution oft˜ij, we can compute the distribution oft˜jusing Lemmas 6 and 9.Definition 10For customer j with arrival timet˜jand time window [ej, hj], letx˜=hj−t˜jsatisfiesinfP∈FEP[x˜]>0andsupP∈FP(x˜<0)>0, and the satisficing measure is defined byρ(x˜)Δ=sup×{β:infa>0{1alnsupP∈FEP[exp(−ax˜)]−1aln(1−β)}≤0}.Sincet˜jhas an ambiguous distribution, we can efficiently calculateρ(x˜)using Theorems 3 and 7. Similar to the previous section, the overall satisficing measure assessing the quality of the whole routing plan can be defined as the sum of the individual customer's satisficing measures.Definition 11For a routing plan of n customers and for each customeri(i=1,…,n), the overall satisficing measure is defined byρ=∑i=1nρ(x˜i),wherex˜idenotes the difference between the due time and the arrival time of customer i.Similar to the satisficing measure proposed for the VRPTWSD, the service provider prefers a higher value of ρ. We can thus integrate ρ into the objective function of the problem, and modify the heuristics accordingly in order to solve the VRPTWST. Even though we assume that the service time is deterministic, the extension to stochastic service time is straightforward and does not require any significant changes to the formulation of the measure.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, satisficing measures are used to evaluate the uncertainties in the stochastic VRPTW, such as stochastic demands and stochastic travel times. The SMA is then proposed by integrating these satisficing measures within an existing tabu-search heuristics for the deterministic VRPTW to solve these two problem variants. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that our approach is a reasonable method to solve the VRPTWSD and VRPTWST. In comparison with known results, the SMA clearly has an advantage of low computational time since the evaluation of the satisficing measure is fast. In addition, the SMA can be developed for many popular distributions, such as Poisson, Gamma, Normal and ambiguous distributions. This means that the SMA can be applied to a wide spectrum of problems, which is a merit for real life, practical implementations.One straightforward extension is to apply the SMA for the VRPTW with both stochastic demand and travel time, however, there is currently no competitive method to solve this latter problem, which makes the comparison difficult. Furthermore, implementing the satisficing measures as an approximation for the chance constraint is also a direction which is worth exploring. As the approximation of Nemirovski and Shapiro (2006) can be extended to the joint chance constraint case, we expect that our satisficing measure can also be used for the joint chance constrained VRPTW. Another interesting question is to assess how good the overall satisficing measure we are using compared to the weighted average, or for example, the worst case measureρ=minrρ(x˜r). Theoretically, future research work on this area includes proposing tighter satisficing measures and applying the SMA to other types of stochastic problems. Additionally, other metaheuristics could be explored to improve the robustness of the proposed method.
