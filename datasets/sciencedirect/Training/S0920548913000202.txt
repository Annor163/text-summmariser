@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The paper presents the results of statistical analyses of ICT innovations on the examples of global and local standardisation. PDCA and methodology of statistical research were applied. Relying on the original research, ICT innovations were analysed in the period between 2000 and 2012, along with all areas of human endeavour. Regression equations were presented by explicit mathematical relations and their applicability in time was analysed.Furthermore, this paper presents unique indices obtained by multicriteria analyses, for a closer determination of ICT innovations and the creation of models of knowledge excellence. The objectives of further development are also given.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The paper deals with the results of comparative analysis of ICT innovations and knowledge based on continuous innovation in ICT subfields on international (ISO, [1]) and local (SRPS, where SRPS is an abbreviation for the standards in Serbia [2]) examples: from the collective to the local and ultimately to the individual. According to International Classification Standards (ICS), the fields of ICT are classified through IT (partially, ICS1=35, with 12 subfields) and the field of telecommunications (ICS1=33, with 13 subfields).The paper presents only a part of the overall dynamic comparative statistical analyses of knowledge innovation from the population of all standardised fields of human endeavour. The collective innovations (global, according to ISO, [1]), as well as local “innovations” of SRPS standards (according to [2]) were analysed by way of ICT applications [3], used as examples of ICT innovations. The paper analyses parts of ICT innovations of global and local standardised knowledge in two ICT fields: IT (ICS=35) with 5853 standardised units, sampled according to ISO and 925 units of knowledge standardised according to SRPS, and the field of telecommunications (ICS=33) with 194 ISO and 1191 SRPS samples.PDCA [4,5] and the methodology of original statistical surveys of ICT innovations were applied for the period between 2000 and 2012, on the population of 42,091 ISO and 33,701 SRPS standards (in the beginning of 2012). Index criteria of ICT innovation were determined as well as ICT range within all other standardised areas. The results of the analysis of multi-year trends and market and financial evaluation point to the amount of innovated elements in PDCA concept at the end of each year of XXI century: 1) from the state of trends and Planning (P) of innovations, with the search of relevant databases — Do (D), from the innovation of a standardised database of knowledge and Check (C), to the improvements of the process and towards the excellence of Action and Advancement (A), with the ultimate goal of improving the products.In the researched areas of ICT (ICS=33 and 35), a “problem” of local relevance was encountered. The problem is becoming even more highlighted in XXI century. In the period between 2008 and 2011 approximately 92% of SRPS “innovations” were processed which are evident from significant quantitative and time criteria (or indices). The situation is similar in terms of other criteria of “innovation” analysis: price index and value index. On the other hand, in the period of approximately 250 working days (2011), over 630 SRPS innovations appeared on the local level. At the same time, 180 SRPS standards (drafts) are under development.Particularly significant are the possibilities of solving the “problems” of how individuals could approach innovation units of knowledge bases, especially in environments, institutions and corporations in developing countries.The focus is on the frequent need for quantitative and qualitative knowledge innovation. Original unique annual analyses that were carried out continuously over a long period (2000–2012) are presented by comparing the trends in IT segments, in order to analyse mathematical relations and “rules”.Some of the analysis criteria of ICT innovations include development activities of technical committees and relevant subcommittees of ISO/IEC JTC 1 [6]. In terms of high-quality education, significant comparative analyses of innovations and directions of further development of new knowledge units in ICT are presented through 808 “collective” ISO/IEC new projects and 209 “local” innovations.The main goal is to achieve high-quality education with innovative results at all levels of hierarchy in practise: Top-down (from the international ISO, over local SRPS requirements, to the innovative products: software, hardware and services, in ICT and other areas of human endeavour with the aid of ICT) and vice versa, Bottom-up.Internal goals were achieved by realisation of ICT applications of statistical research and by obtained results. The initial hypotheses of external research goals of ICT innovations are given in the presentation of the obtained results through the possibilities of:H1)application of newly-developed and innovated software on JAVA platform, for simplified quantitative and qualitative analyses and mutual comparison of the fields and sub-fields of ICT, as well as all the other fields of internationally standardised work, creativity and innovation (ICS=1, 3, 5 … 99), towards the comparable characteristics (through multicriteria analyses and the corresponding indices) for the two highest levels of “the game” in ICT innovations: global and local,establishing clear correlation: global–local (collective) ICT innovations (on the examples of ISO–SRPS), with the annual trend of innovating knowledge units,defining the indices and relation between continuous (annual) and discontinuous (cumulative, multi-year) innovation of individual knowledge,setting regression equations by explicit mathematical relations, as well as their applicability in the temporal and space dimension of the afore-mentioned issues (global–local), at the platform of standardisation,showing the highest level of ICT innovation, on the examples of standardisation in all fields of human endeavour, by comparative indices,predicting future resource needs, planning financial needs for the evaluation of knowledge units and requirements in each individual subfield or all of them taken as a whole, in the subcommittees, development stages of new projects and products aiming for the model of knowledge excellence.Some of the external goals of this paper are the selection of the analysis results which provide answers and solutions to important issues such as:1.Can one define and determine the index parameters for comparing ICT innovations through statistical research of standardised knowledge units?What are the specific challenges and correlations that innovators encounter in developing economies, both directly in ICT and in other fields where ICT is applied, either in local conditions (for example, knowledge innovations according to SRPS) or in comparison with international collective skills, requirements and obligations of the standards (according to ISO, in over 160 ISO member states)?How does innovation takes shape in PDCA and how is it different, if at all, from industrialised economies (and what is the level of difference, on the examples of ICT standardisation: SRPS in relation to ISO, local knowledge (or national, to individual) in relation to the collective international innovations)? Is it possible to determine the quantity indices (Iq) on the relation between (collective-local) resources (ISO–SRPS)?What are the enabling quality factors (at all levels of ICT and in temporal continuity of Deming's PDCA methodology: starting from the (P) planning, over the development of new projects — (D) Do, followed by checking of the application — (C) Check, and finally to the new innovations — (A) Advancement) that need to be considered to help innovators? What follows is the analysis of the results regarding Time indices on the relations of global–local resources (ISO–SRPS).Do institutional and limited resources provide opportunities for innovators or do they hinder innovators in the ICT sector? What follows is the analysis of the results regarding Price indices and value indices on the relations of global–local resources.According to [7], “Quality is free” philosophy was present in the previous century. Nowadays, standards are extremely costly.The original analyses of the conditions and trends in IT were carried out several times a year: [8] — standardisation of IT applications and trends to 31.12. 2000, [9] — comparative performance of ISO standardisation, based on all twelve segments of IT and over then 1800 ISO documents per year (2000–2001–2002), [10] — partial analysis refers to the nine-year period (2000–2008), being presented through the contrasting analysis of trends within particular IT segments. The paper presents the results at the beginning of each calendar year, 2000–2012. Most researches deal with the standards in developed countries, while a considerably smaller number deals with the standards in developing countries, which leads to the “standardisation gap” of ICT standards in these environments with different degrees of development [11].The focus of this paper is Quality of society level (Fig. 1). Therefore, majority of the above-mentioned related papers deal with this level. There is a significant number of articles dealing with ICT innovation in correlation with: finance, standardisation, related benefits, lifecycle of standards, formal and informal standards, globalisation, or “localisation” on the examples of governments, impacts on socio-economic development of developing countries, etc. In this paper, the framework of “the game” is presented on five levels (Fig. 1), and [12] explicates the workings of ICT standards on two game levels: level one (global) is a competition level which sets ICT standards within a nation or region and level two (local) is a competition level which sets the global ICT standards with reference to local standards. The article [13] presents the results of the research study (standards' lifecycle) and survival rates of formal standards in telecommunication and information technology, i.e. in the fields that are the focus of this work. According to [14], ICT standards are becoming increasingly intertwined with functions that are paradigmatic responsibilities of governments in several areas: innovations and competition policy of a nation; the ability of governments to perform services efficiently and cost-effectively. The papers dealing with the changes of national systems of innovation, as [15], promote a friendly critique of the approach to the national systems of innovations and offer some suggestions for its future development.The article [16] considers the relation between finance and contribution of ICT to macroeconomic performances, and this paper aims to contribute to the level of Quality of company, where, at the same time, ICTs are essentially important for social development and economic growth, as in the paper [17]. There are more papers dealing with knowledge innovation, towards business services, as [18], where the Quality of society level leads to the Quality of Products level (QoP), all through the Quality of company (or Quality Assurance — QA) and Quality of Business (process) levels (QoB), Fig. 1.The paper [19] considers the relations that exist between standardisation, and the instructions regarding the innovations in ICT. In addition, this paper considers the aspect of “PDCA”.As much as in previous years, in the last few years PDCA is used as a method of improving web-based intelligent reports of an E-learning system as an intelligent system [20], or the PDCA cycle is used as the tool in the methodology which is based on the Crosby's philosophy [21], or for the harmonisation of multiple standards and models such as ISO 27001 and ISO 20000, and ISO 9001 [22].There are a number of authors in the field of statistics and dynamics analyses of innovations, such as [23], whose work develops an incomplete contract model of the licencing relations to analyse dynamic effects of licencing on Research & Development competition in the innovation market, but not with this concept of multicriteria analyses. The paper [24] gives a short and very rough overview of the ongoing work in the field of statistics relating to the development of ICT and its impacts on the economies and on the society as a whole, which is the ultimate goal of this paper. Many years ago, the authors of [25] noticed that in the period between 1903 and 1941, an average monthly production of cars in the USA had a shape of a logistic curve. However, these and similar results cannot be generalised as principles of economic development, because this would be mathematical formalism that has no justification in PDCA.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Based on the results and indicated analyses in the fields of ICT innovations (ICS1=33 and 35), it can be concluded that the continuous updating of knowledge of each individual expert in ICT directly depends on PDCA level.The conclusions arising from the research (or from the details of analysis), can be grouped in the phases of the spiral of knowledge quality in PDCA:P) According to the presented trends of developing, publishing, using and withdrawing ISO–SRPS innovations, mathematical equations were obtained and trend lines were presented (in theory). As for the aspect of innovation, some other indicators were more important, such as the indices of planned innovations through new developing projects (Iqu, Iqds, Iqda, Iqdc, Ivis, Iv).D) At the level of “game” in “Do-phase” (with the goal towards the process excellence), “availability” of the standards has been proven through annual innovations and related indices of quantity, prices and valued units of standardised innovations, and with the possibility of a simple “copying” on the monthly, weekly or daily work-related obligations and innovations of individuals.C) For the presented field of ICT (with the subfields of ICS1=35 and ICS1=33) the relations between global and local innovations (such as ISO–SRPS) are obvious, where ICT innovations are mostly unavailable to individuals in PDCA.A) Improving the situation in practice (in Phase A — Action and Advancement) requires this alternative solutions of a local (state or national) approach to the problem of standardised units of knowledge bases in the fields and subfields of expertise (ICS1=33, 35, and all the other fields for ICS1=1 to 99), for the innovations of all products.Innovative (or continuous or developmental involvement in new projects) updating of individual knowledge has an obvious advantage over discontinuous (or aggregate) updating of individual knowledge. Based on individual knowledge in subcommittees and developmental stages of new projects (in practice), financial needs in each individual subfield or in all of them are of special importance among the analysed and presented possibilities for anticipating future resources (especially on the examples of SRPS innovations in PDCA).
