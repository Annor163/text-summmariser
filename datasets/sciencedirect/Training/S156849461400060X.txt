In actuality, for example, the review of the National Science Foundation and the blind peer review of doctoral dissertation in China, the evaluation experts are requested to provide two types of information such as the performance of the evaluation objects and the familiarity with the evaluation areas (called confidence levels). However, existing information aggregation research achievements cannot be used to fusion the two types information described above effectively. In this paper, we focus on the information aggregation issue in the situation where there are confidence levels of the aggregated arguments under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Firstly, we develop some confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted aggregation operators, such as the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (CIFWA) operator and the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric (CIFWG) operator. Then, based on the Einstein operations, we proposed the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted averaging (CIFEWA) operator and the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted geometric (CIFEWG) operator. Finally, a practical example about the review of the doctoral dissertation in Chinese universities is provided to illustrate the developed intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation operators.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Fuzzy set (FS) theory proposed by Zadeh [1], is a powerful tool and has been applied to various fields. However, FS theory only has a membership degree which is not perfect in expressing the fuzziness of the subjective world. The intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory is an extension of FS theory and it was developed by Atanassov [2]. IFS is characterized by a membership degree and a non-membership degree [2–5]. One of the research branches of IFS theory is intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making and have attracted many attentions from researchers [6–15]. To aggregate all the performance on attributes for alternatives is a very critical step in decision making problem and the aggregation operators play an important role during the information fusion process.Many scholars are interested in intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation operators. The intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) operator and intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric (IFWG) operator are two widely cited operators and they were introduced by Xu [16] and Xu and Yager [17] respectively. Based on which, the IFOWA operator, IFOWG operator, intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid averaging (IFHA) operator, intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid geometric (IFHG) operator, generalized IFWA, generalized IFWG, generalized IFOWA, generalized IFOWG are proposed [18]. Combined with the Bonferroni mean (BM), intuitionistic fuzzy Bonferroni mean (IFBM) and weighted IFBM are introduced by Xu [19]. Later, Xia et al. [20] proposed a series of extended IFBM operators, such as the GIFBM and weighted GIFBM. Inspired by the power aggregation operators [21,22], some intuitionistic fuzzy power operators are proposed, such as IFPWA, IFPWG, IFPOWA and IFPOWG [23]. The intuitionistic fuzzy power operators and intuitionistic fuzzy Bonferroni operators are two types of correlated aggregate operators; they are able to describe the relationships quantitatively from the objective perspective. Choquet integral based intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators, such as the intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet average (IFCA) operator, the IFCG operator [24,25], the quasi intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet ordered averaging (QIFCOA) operator [26], and induced generalized intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet ordered averaging (I-GIFCOA) operator [27] are also able to depict the interrelations between the aggregated arguments. However, they are different from the intuitionistic fuzzy power operators and intuitionistic fuzzy Bonferroni operators, since they are depict the interrelations from the subjective perspective.In order to fusion the intuitionistic fuzzy preference information, Xia et al. [28] proposed some intuitionistic multiplicative preference information aggregation operators, such as intuitionistic multiplicative weighted averaging (IMWA) operator, intuitionistic multiplicative weighted geometric (IMWG) operator, generalized IMWA operator and generalized IMWG operator. Furthermore, Xia and Xu [29] proposed some extended intuitionistic multiplicative preference information aggregation operators, such as extended intuitionistic multiplicative weighted averaging (EIMWA) operator, extended intuitionistic multiplicative power averaging (EIMPA) operator, extended intuitionistic multiplicative Choquet averaging (EIMCA) operator, extended intuitionistic multiplicative power ordered averaging (EIMPOA) operator and extended intuitionistic multiplicative Choquet ordered averaging (EIMCOA) operator. Fig. 1shows the development and the relations of the above described aggregation operators.But despite these remarkable achievements, the intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation method is far from an unmitigated perfection. Most of the existing aggregation operators not consider the confidence level of the aggregated arguments provided by the information providers. However, in many real decision making problems, such as the blind peer review of doctoral dissertation in China, the evaluation experts are requested to provide two types of information such as the performance of the evaluation objects and the familiarity with the evaluation areas (called confidence levels) [30,31]. In this paper, we focus on the intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation issue in the situation where the confidences levels of the aggregated arguments are asked to be considered. The main research contents can be summarized as following five parts, (1) confidence intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operator; (2) confidence intuitionistic fuzzy ordered aggregation operator; (3) confidence intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein aggregation operator; (4) confidence intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein ordered aggregation operator; (5) group decision making method based on the above operators.The logistic relationship of above main content can be vivid compared to the construction of two – story house which shown in Fig. 2. This paper focuses on intuitionistic fuzzy set and information aggregation theory and uses them as the theory basis and methodology, just as the foundation of the house. Then this paper studied confidence intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators and confidence intuitionistic fuzzy ordered aggregation operators, the two are two supporting pillars of the house's first floor and presents the progressive relationship. Meanwhile, based on Intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein operations, this paper further studied confidence intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein aggregation operators and confidence intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein ordered aggregation operators, the two also have the progressive relationship and refer to the supporting pillars of the second floor. At the end, an approach to intuitionistic fuzzy group decision making under confidence levels is introduced based on the proposed aggregation operators, it can be compared to the roof of the house.The Bulgarian scholar Atanossv [2] extended the fuzzy set theory [1] and introduced the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory. The Definition of IFS was defined as follows and has been cited thousands of times. It could be found in most of the research papers about IFS theory.Definition 1The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) A on X is defined as follows:In Eq. (1), the μA(x) and vA(x) are functions with the values between closed interval [0, 1]. In addition, the sum of μA(x) and vA(x) are also values between closed interval [0, 1].For convenience, Xu [16] named α=(μα, vα) an intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN).In the following, we introduce the basic operations of IFNs which was proposed by Xu [16] and Xu and Yager [17].Definition 2For three IFNs α, α1, α2∈V, λ>0, some operations were given as follows:1)α1⊕α2=(μα1+μα2−μα1μα2,vα1vα2)α1⊗α2=(μα1μα2,vα1+vα2−vα1vα2)λα=(1−(1−μα)λ,vαλ)αλ=(μαλ,1−(1−vα)λ)Xu and Yager [17] introduced an effective approach to rank two IFNsαi=(μαi,vαi)(i=1,2). The main idea of this method is to rank any two IFNs according to their score functions and accuracy functions. There are two different cases when comparing any two IFNs.1)If the score functions are different, the bigger the score functions of an IFN, the bigger IFN.If two score functions are equal, then the accuracy function should be adopted and the ranking is depends on it totally. In other words, the bigger the accuracy functions of an IFN, the bigger IFN.In actuality, the evaluation experts are requested to provide two types of information such as the performance of the evaluation objects and the familiarity with the evaluation areas (called confidence levels) [30,31]. In this Section, we investigate the information aggregation methods under confidence levels in the context of intuitionistic fuzzy environment and proposed a series of aggregation operators.In the following, we propose the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (CIFWA) operator and confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric (CIFWG) operator and study the desirable properties of the proposed operators. The definition of the CIFWA operator was given as follows:Definition 3Let (α1, α2, …, αn) be a collection of IFNs, ljbe the confidence levels of IFN αjand 0≤lj≤1, w=(w1, w2, …, wn) be the weight vector of them, such thatwj∈[0,1]and∑j=1nwj=1. IfEspecially, if l1=l2=⋯=ln=1, then the CIFWA operator reduces to the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) operator(3)IFWA(α1,α2,…,αn)=⊕j=1nwjαj=w1α1⊕w2α2⊕⋯⊕wnαnwhich was proposed by Xu [16].By Definitions 2 and 3, we can get the following Theorem.Theorem 1Let (α1, α2, …, αn) be a collection of IFNs, ljbe the confidence levels of IFN αjand 0≤lj≤1, then their aggregated value by using CIFWA operator is also an IFN andOn the one hand,Eq. (10) by using mathematical induction on n:1)For n=2: Since(11)(w1l1)α1=(1−(1−μ1)w1l1,(v1)w1l1)(12)(w2l2)α2=(1−(1−μ2)w2l2,(v2)w2l2)We have(13)CIFWA(<l1,α1>,<l2,α2>)=(w1l1)α1⊕(w2l2)α2=(1−(1−μ1)w1l1(1−μ2)w2l2,(v1)w1l1(v2)w2l2)If Eq. (10) holds for n=k, that isObviously, the prove method of Theorem 1 is based on mathematical induction. This kind of proves method was widely used in existing research results, such as Xu [16], Zhao et al. [18].Combined the CIFWA operator with geometric mean, we study the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation from the geometric perspective. Firstly, we give the definition of the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric (CIFWG) operator as follows:Definition 4Let (α1, α2, …, αn) be a collection of IFNs, ljbe the confidence levels of IFN αjand 0≤lj≤1,w=(w1,w2,...,wn)be the weight vector of them, such thatwj∈[0,1]and∑j=1nwj=1. A confidence intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric (CIFWG) operator is a mapping In→I such that:Especially, if l1=l2=⋯=ln=1, then the CIFWG operator reduces to the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric (IFWG) operator(17)IFWG(α1,α2,…,αn)=⊗j=1nαjwj=α1w1⊗α2w2⊗⋯⊗αnwnwhich was proposed by Xu and Yager [17].Theorem 2Let (α1, α2, …, αn) be a collection of IFNs, ljbe the confidence levels of IFN αjand 0≤lj≤1, then their aggregated value by using CIFWG operator is also an IFN andOn the one hand,On the other hand,(21)αλ1λ2=(μαλ1λ2,1−(1−vα)λ1λ2)Hence,(22)(αλ2)λ1=αλ1λ2Then,(23)CIFWG(<l1,α1>,<l2,α2>,…,<ln,αn>)=⊗j=1n(αjlj)wj=⊗j=1n(αj)wjlj=(α1)w1l1⊗(α2)w2l2⊗⋯⊗(αn)wnlnIn the following, we prove(24)CIFWG(<l1,α1>,<l2,α2>,…,<ln,αn>)=⊗j=1n(αj)wjlj=∏j=1n(μj)lj×wj,1−∏j=1n(1−vj)lj×wjEq. (24) by using mathematical induction on n:1)For n=2: Since(25)(α1)w1l1=(μ1)w1l1,1−(1−v1)w1l1(26)(α2)w2l2=(μ2)w2l2,1−(1−v2)w2l2We have(27)CIFWG(<l1,α1>,<l2,α2>)=(α1)w1l1⊗(α2)w2l2=(μ1)w1l1(μ2)w2l2,1−(1−v1)w1l1(1−v2)w2l2If Eq. (24) holds for n=k, that isSimilar to Theorem 1, the proof of Theorem 2 borrows from Xu [16], Zhao et al. [18].Letαj=(μαj,vαj)andβj=(μβj,vβj)(j=1, 2, …, n) be two collections of IFNs, lj(0≤lj≤1) andwj(wj∈[0,1])be the confidence levels and weight of them, respectively, with∑j=1nwj=1. Then we can easily prove the CIFWA and CIFWG operators have the properties of monotonicity, boundness and idempotency as follows:1)(Monotonicity) Ifμαj≤μβjandvαj≥vβj, for all j, then(30)CIFWA(<l1,α1>,<l2,α2>,…,<ln,αn>)≤CIFWA(<l1,β1>,<l2,β2>,…,<ln,βn>)(31)CIFWG(<l1,α1>,<l2,α2>,…,<ln,αn>)≤CIFWG(<l1,β1>,<l2,β2>,…,<ln,βn>)(Boundness)(32)minj(ljαj)≤CIFWA(<l1,α1>,<l2,α2>,…,<ln,αn>)≤maxj(ljαj)(33)minj(αjlj)≤CIFWG(<l1,α1>,<l2,α2>,…,<ln,αn>)≤maxj(αjlj)(idempotency) Ifα=(μα,vα)be an IFN,μαj=μαandvαj=vα, for all j, thenIn this section, we introduce the idea of OWA [32] into confidence intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation problem and propose some aggregation operator correspondingly.Definition 5Let (α1, α2, …, αn) be a collection of IFNs, ljbe the confidence levels of IFN αjand 0≤lj≤1, a confidence intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (CIFOWA) operator is a mapping In→I:A confidence intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (CIFOWG) operator is a mapping In→I:(37)CIFOWG(<l1,α1>,<l2,α2>,…,<ln,αn>)=⊗j=1n(αδ(j)lδ(j))ωj=(αδ(1)lδ(1))ω1⊗(αδ(2)lδ(2))ω2⊗⋯⊗(αδ(n)lδ(n))ωnwhere ω=(ω1, ω2, …, ωn)Tis the associated weight vector such that ωj∈[0, 1] and∑j=1nωj=1. δ:(1, 2, …, n)→(1, 2, …, n),αδ(j)lδ(j)is the jth largest ofαjlj, lδ(j)αδ(j) is the jth largest of ljαj.Especially, if l1=l2=⋯=ln=1, then the CIFOWA operator reduces to the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (IFOWA) operator(38)IFOWA(α1,α2,…,αn)=⊕j=1nωjαj=ω1α1⊕ω2α2⊕⋯⊕ωnαnwhich was proposed by Xu [16].If l1=l2=⋯=ln=1, then the CIFOWG operator reduces to the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric (IFOWG) operator(39)IFOWG(α1,α2,…,αn)=⊗j=1nωjασ(j)=αδ(1)ω1⊗αδ(2)ω2⊗⋯⊗αδ(n)ωnwhich was proposed by Xu and Yager [17].Theorem 3Let (α1, α2, …, αn) be a collection of IFNs, ljbe the confidence levels of IFN αjand 0≤lj≤1, then their aggregated value by using CIFOWA operator is also an IFN andThe proof of Theorem 3 is similar to the proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, the description will not repeat here.It should be noted that the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation operators proposed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are based on Algebraic t-conorm and t-norm. However, Wang and Liu [33,34] pointed out that the Algebraic t-conorm and t-norm is not the only operations for intuitionistic fuzzy set and proposed the Einstein operations for IFNs as follows.For three IFNs α, α1, α2∈V, some Einstein operational laws were given as follows:1)α1⊕εα2=μα1+μα21+μα1μα2,vα1vα21+(1−vα1)(1−vα2);α1⊗εα2=μα1μα21+(1−μα1)(1−μα2),vα1+vα21+vα1vα2;αλ=2μαλ(2−μα)λ+μαλ,(1+vα)λ−(1−vα)λ(1+vα)λ+(1−vα)λ(λ>0);λα=(1+μα)λ−(1−μα)λ(1+μα)λ+(1−μα)λ,2vαλ(2−vα)λ+vαλ(λ>0).Suppose α is an IFN, the following equations are valid (Wang and Liu [33,34])(42)αλ1λ2=(αλ1)λ2(λ1>0,λ2>0)(43)λ1(λ2α)=(λ1λ2)α(λ1>0,λ2>0)Based on the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein operational laws, we develop some confidence operators for aggregating the intuitionistic fuzzy information.Definition 6Let (α1, α2, …, αn) be a collection of IFNs, ljbe the confidence levels of IFN αjand 0≤lj≤1,w=(w1,w2,...,wn)be the weight vector of them, such thatwj∈[0,1]and∑j=1nwj=1. A confidence intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted averaging (CIFEWA) operator is a mapping In→I such that:Especially, if l1=l2=⋯=ln=1, then the CIFEWA operator reduces to the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted averaging (IFEWA) operator(45)IFEWA(α1,α2,…,αn)=⊕j=1nwjαj=w1α1⊕w2α2⊕⋯⊕wnαnwhich was proposed by Wang and Liu [34].Theorem 4Let (α1, α2, …, αn) be a collection of IFNs, ljbe the confidence levels of IFN αjand 0≤lj≤1, then their aggregated value by using CIFEWA operator is also an IFN andAccording to Eqs.

During the process of group decision making, the aggregation operators play an important role in aggregating the experts’ evaluations to a comprehensive one [43–46]. Motivated by the existing research idea, we use the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators to group decision making problem.In order to solve the group decision making problems with confidence levels in the context of intuitionistic fuzzy environment, we introduce a decision analysis approach in this section. Firstly, decision makers are required to give their evaluation on alternatives using IFNs, together with the confidence levels of the evaluation subject. Secondly, the aggregation operators proposed in Section 3 are applied to aggregate the each decision maker's evaluation to collective evaluation on each alternative. Thirdly, we aggregate the performance of each attribute for each alternative and get the comprehensive IFNs. Finally, the ranking of the alternatives can be got by calculating their score function and accuracy function of the comprehensive intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Based on the ranking, the optimal alternative can be singled out and we will describe the detailed decision making method in the remainder of this section.For a multi-criteria decision making problem, let X={X1, X2, .., Xm} be a set of m alternatives, C={c1, c2, .., cn} a set of n criteria, whose weight vector isw=(w1,w2,...,wn)T, satisfyingwj>0, j=1, 2, ..., n and∑i=1nwj=1, and E={e1, e2, ⋯, ep} is the set of decision makers and their weight vector is ω=(ω1, ω2, ..., ωp)T, satisfying ωq>0, q=1, 2, ..., n and∑q=1pωq=1.Step 1: LetA(q)=(αij(q))m×nbe an intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix, andαij(q)=(μij(q),vij(q))is an attribute value provided by the decision maker eq, which is expressed in an IFN. Simultaneously, the decision makers provide the degrees that they are familiar with the research topics and give out the confidence levels lq(0≤lq≤1).Step 2: Utilize the CIFWA operator(74)αij=CIFWA(αij1,αij2,...,αijp)=1−∏j=1n(1−μijq)lq×ωq,∏j=1n(vijq)lq×ωqor the CIFWG operator:(75)αij=CIFWG(αij1,αij2,...,αijp)=∏j=1n(μijq)lq×ωq,1−∏j=1n(1−vijq)lq×ωqto aggregate all the individual intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixA(q)=(αij(q))m×nq=1,2,...,pinto the collective intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixA=(αij)m×n, i=1, 2, ..., m; j=1, 2, ..., n.Step 3: Aggregate the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers αijfor each alternative Xiby the IFWA (or IFWG) operator:(76)αi=IFWAαi1,αi2,...,αin=1−Πj=1n(1−μij)wj,Πj=1n(vij)wji=1,2,...,m(77)αi=IFWGαi1,αi2,...,αin=Πj=1n(μij)wj,1−Πj=1n(1−vij)wji=1,2,...,mStep 4. Rank all the alternatives.In many Chinese universities, the doctoral dissertation will be reviewed by three experts anonymously and suppose they have same importance during this review process. And they will review dissertation according to five criteria, Including topic selection and literature review, innovation, theory basis and special knowledge, capacity of scientific research and theses writing. Different weights are given to different criteria and the standards for those principles can be referred to Table 1.Step 1: Three decision makers evaluate the five doctoral dissertation Xi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with respect to the attributes Cj(j=1, 2, …, 5), and the decision makers provide the degrees that they are familiar with the research topics and give out the confidence levels lq(0≤lq≤1) simultaneously. Then, we construct the following three intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixD(q)=(dij(q))5×4(q=1, 2, 3) (see Tables 2–4).Step 2: Utilize the CIFWA operator (Eq. (75)) to aggregate the three individual intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixA(q)=(αij(q))5×5q=1,2,3into the collective intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixA=(αij)5×5(see Table 5).Step 3: Utilize the IFWA operator (Eq. (77)) to aggregate all the preference values αiji=1,2,3,4,5in the ith line of A, and get the overall preference values αi.α1=0.5055,0.3958,α2=0.4219,0.4582α3=0.4949,0.4020,α4=0.4602,0.4703,α5=0.4781,0.4923Step 4: Calculate the scores ofαii=1,2,3,4,5respectively:S1=0.1097,S2=−0.0363,S3=0.0930,S4=−0.0101,S5=−0.0143Based on the CIFWG operator, the main steps are as follows:Step 1′: See step 1Step 2′: Utilize the CIFWG operator (Eq. (76)) to aggregate the three individual intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixA(q)=(αij(q))5×5q=1,2,3into the collective intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixA′=α′ij5×5(see Table 6).Step 3′: Utilize the IFWG operator (Eq. (77)) to aggregate all the preference valuesα′iji=1,2,3,4,5in the ith line of A′, and get the overall preference valuesα′iα′1=0.8835,0.0847,α′2=0.8269,0.1143,α′3=0.8579,0.1011,α′4=0.8418,0.1393,α′5=0.8659,0.1256Step 4′: Calculate the scores ofα′iji=1,2,3,4,5, respectively:S′1=0.7988,S′2=0.7126,S′3=0.7567,S′4=0.7025,S′5=0.7403SinceS′1>S′3>S′5>S′2>S′4we haveX1≻X3≻X5≻X2≻X4If we do not consider the confidence levels factor, in other words, if all the decision makers are marked by sure familiar with the evaluated objects, then our proposed operators are reduced to the existing intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators. However, the three experts are not familiar with the doctoral dissertation absolutely. To deal with such situations, the confidence intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators proposed in this paper are useful tools. From the above analysis, the main advantages over the traditional intuitionistic fuzzy operators are not only due to the fact that our operators accommodate the intuitionistic fuzzy environment but also due to the consideration of the confidence levels among the decision makers, which makes it more feasible and practical.We have developed a series of confidence intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators, such as CIFWA, CIFWG, CIFEWA and CIFWG operators. The main characteristic of these confidence aggregation operators is that they not only take into account the evaluation information of the decision makers but also consider the degrees that they are familiar with the research topics. Then, we have utilized the confidence operators to multiple attribute group decision making problems with intuitionistic fuzzy information. Furthermore, the confidence operators based on the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein operations have also been studied, and a blind peer review of doctoral dissertation evaluation problem in China's university has been used to verify the validity of our results and illustrate the application process.
