@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, a low-complexity algorithm SAGE-USL is presented for 3-dimensional (3-D) localization of multiple acoustic sources in a shallow ocean with non-Gaussian ambient noise, using a vertical and a horizontal linear array of sensors. In the proposed method, noise is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. Initial estimates of the unknown parameters (source coordinates, signal waveforms and noise parameters) are obtained by known/conventional methods, and a generalized expectation maximization algorithm is used to update the initial estimates iteratively. Simulation results indicate that convergence is reached in a small number of (≤10) iterations. Initialization requires one 2-D search and one 1-D search, and the iterative updates require a sequence of 1-D searches. Therefore the computational complexity of the SAGE-USL algorithm is lower than that of conventional techniques such as 3-D MUSIC by several orders of magnitude. We also derive the Cramér–Rao Bound (CRB) for 3-D localization of multiple sources in a range-independent ocean. Simulation results are presented to show that the root-mean-square localization errors of SAGE-USL are close to the corresponding CRBs and significantly lower than those of 3-D MUSIC.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Three-dimensional (3-D) localization of acoustic sources in shallow ocean is an interesting albeit challenging problem. Conventional methods of 3-D localization include several versions of the matched field processing (MFP) technique such as Bartlett, Capon, and MUSIC processors [1–3]. In the simplest and most robust version, viz., the Bartlett processor, an ambiguity function is computed by correlating the data vector measured by a horizontal linear array (HLA) with replicas of the signal vector on a 3-D grid over the search region. The resultant ambiguity function has a broad peak and a low peak-to-sidelobe ratio. Consequently, the Bartlett processor is susceptible to interference and has a low resolution. The Capon and MUSIC processors provide higher resolution. However, all these methods perform localization through a 3-D search which entails a high degree of computational complexity.Also, an HLA does not provide good estimates of range and depth since the signal vector at an HLA is not very sensitive to variation of source range and depth. An alternative approach is to use a hybrid 2-D array composed of an HLA and a vertical linear array (VLA). The VLA data may be used to perform multiple-source range–depth estimation by any of the MFP methods [1–3] mentioned above. The HLA data may then be used in conjunction with the estimated range–depth of each source to estimate the bearing of that source through a 1-D search. This approach provides better range–depth estimates. The computational complexity is also reduced since the hybrid array requires one 2-D search for range–depth estimation and J 1-D searches for bearing estimation of J sources.In recent years, some methods have been developed for bearing estimation of multiple sources in the ocean without prior knowledge of their ranges and depths [4–7]. These methods include subspace intersection method (SIM) [4,5], Rayleigh MUSIC (R-MUSIC) [6], and modified R-MUSIC (R-MUSIC-mdf) [7]. These methods exploit the fact that the N-dimensional signal vector at an array of N sensors belongs to an M-dimensional modal subspace ifN>M, where M is the number of normal modes supported by the underwater acoustic channel. Thus it is now possible to localize J sources through one 2-D search and one 1-D search if a hybrid array is employed.None of the above-mentioned localization methods make any assumption about the probability distribution of the additive noise. Hence, these methods can be employed with equal facility in all types of environmental noise. However, none of these methods has any claims to optimality in the statistical sense. It is known that the best statistical performance is provided by the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator which is asymptotically efficient and unbiased. Tabrikian and Messer [8] have investigated the problem of ML localization of a monochromatic source in a range-independent ocean in the presence of Gaussian noise using a hybrid array. However, it is known that ambient noise in the ocean is often non-Gaussian with a heavy-tailed probability density function (PDF) due to the impulsive nature of several noise sources such as shipping traffic, snapping shrimp, rain, etc. [9–11]. Extension of Tabrikian and Messer's approach to the problem of localization in non-Gaussian noise is a highly complex task. ML localization involves estimation of not only the 3J coordinates of J sources but also a large number of nuisance parameters associated with the signals and noise. Fessler and Hero [12] have proposed space-alternating generalized expectation–maximization (SAGE) algorithm to decrease the complexity of ML estimation. Kozick and Sadler [13] have applied the SAGE algorithm to the problem of estimating the directions of arrival (DOA) and signal waveform of plane waves in non-Gaussian noise represented by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Due to the universal approximation property of the GM distribution [14], any heavy-tailed noise PDF in the ocean can be modeled as a GM with a small number of components. In this paper we present an adaptation of the Kozick and Sadler algorithm [13] for 3-D localization of multiple acoustic sources in a range-independent ocean with non-Gaussian noise.The localization algorithm proposed in this paper will be designated space-alternating generalized expectation–maximization for underwater source localization (SAGE-USL). The proposed algorithm uses data from a hybrid array consisting of an HLA and a VLA. The signals are modeled as complex exponentials with slowly varying amplitudes. Noise is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian mixture (GM) since a wide class of non-Gaussian heavy-tailed noise distributions, including those encountered in the marine environment, can be well approximated by a GM distribution with a small number of components. The unknown parameters may be divided into two groups: (1) the desired parameters, consisting of the number of sources and their coordinates, and (2) the nuisance parameters, consisting of the signal envelopes and the parameters required to model the Gaussian mixture noise PDF. The algorithm involves initial estimation of all parameters using known methods, followed by an iterative procedure based on a modified version of the SAGE algorithm for updating the estimates sequentially. The noise parameters are initialized using a procedure similar to that of Kozick and Sadler [13]. The number of sources is estimated using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion [15]. Initial estimates of source ranges and depths are obtained from the VLA data using 2-D MUSIC algorithm [3], and initial bearing estimates are obtained from HLA data using the R-MUSIC-mdf algorithm [7]. A simple search-maximize-discard algorithm, described in Section 3 is used to determine the pairings of the range–depth and bearing estimates. The full hybrid array data and the estimated source locations are used to obtain initial estimates of the source envelopes. A modified version of the SAGE algorithm is then used to update the initial estimates. This paper is an extension of our earlier work [16] on localization of a single source in shallow ocean with non-Gaussian noise using a hybrid array.In this paper, we have also derived expressions for Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) for 3-D localization of underwater acoustic sources in non-Gaussian noise with symmetric PDF. We have compared the root mean square localization errors of the proposed SAGE-USL algorithm and the classical 3-D MUSIC algorithm [3] with the CRB. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is significantly better than that of 3-D MUSIC.The paper is organized as follows. The data model is presented in Section 2. Details of the proposed 3-D localization algorithm are presented in Section 3. Derivation of the CRB is presented in Section 4. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in Section 5. Simulation results and conclusions are presented in Sections 6 and 7 respectively.Consider a T-shaped array of N sensors receiving narrowband signals of center-frequency (ω/2π) from J far-field point sources in a deterministic and time-invariant shallow ocean. Let the array be composed of a uniformNH-sensor HLA with inter-sensor spacingdHlocated at depthzH, and a uniform VLA ofNV=N−NH+1sensors located at depthszVn=zV1+(n−1)dV,n=1,…,NV. Let the array output at time t be denoted by theN×1vectory(t)e−jωt. We consider K snapshots ofy(t), which can be expressed as(1)y(t)=[yH(t)TyV(t)T]T;t=1,…,K,(2)yH(t)=PH(x)s(t)+wH(t),yV(t)=PV(x)s(t)+wV(t),whereyH(t)=[yH,1(t)…yH,NH(t)]TandyV(t)=[yV,1(t)…yV,NV(t)]Tare the received data vectors at the HLA and VLA respectively,wH(t)=[wH,1(t)…wH,NH(t)]TandwV(t)=[wV,1(t)…wV,NV(t)]Tare the corresponding additive noise vectors, and superscript T denotes matrix transpose. The vectors(t)is defined ass(t)=[s1(t)…sJ(t)]T, wheresj(t)is the slowly varying complex amplitude of the jth source signal at time t. We assume a “conditional model” [17] for the signals, wherein the signal envelopes{sj(t);t=1,…,K}, forj=1,…,J, are modeled as unknown nonrandom functions. The vectorx=[x1…xJ]is a row vector of the source positions wherexj=[rj,zj,θj]denotes the jth source position in terms of rangerj, depthzj, and bearingθj. The rangerjis measured with reference to the VLA and the bearingθjis measured with reference to the endfire direction of the HLA. It is assumed that any change in the source position over the set of K snapshots is negligible. The matrices(3)PH(x)=[pH(x1)…pH(xJ)],PV(x)=[pV(x1)…pV(xJ)]are the steering matrices of the HLA and the VLA, andpH(xj)andpV(xj)are the steering vectors denoting the response of these arrays to a source of unit strength located at the positionxj.We shall model the ocean as a range-independent waveguide in which the sound speed, density, and water column depth are range-independent, i.e. a water column of depth h, sound speed c and density ρ lies over a sea bed of sound speedcband densityρb. Absorption in the ocean bottom is taken into account by assuming the sound speedcbto be a complex-valued function. According to the normal mode theory of sound propagation in a waveguide [18], the acoustic pressure due to a point source in the far-field region can be expressed as the sum of a discrete set of normal modes. Under the far-field approximation, the signal vector at the HLA due to the jth source can be expressed as [18](4)pH(xj)=A(θj)b(rj,zj);j=1,…,J,whereb(rj,zj)=[b1j…bMj]Tis the mode amplitude vector whose elements are(5)bmj=Ψ(zH)Ψ(zj)e(ikm−αm)rjkmrj;m=1,…,M,andA(θj)is anNH×Mmatrix expressed as(6)A(θj)=[a(k1cosθj)…a(kMcosθj)],(7)a(kmcosθj)=[1eikmdHcosθj…ei(NH−1)kmdHcosθj]T;m=1,…,M.In (5)–(7),Ψm(z)is the eigenfunction of the mth normal mode of the channel,kmandαmdenote respectively the associated wavenumber and attenuation coefficient. The normal modes effectively account for multipath propagation in the waveguide. The number of propagating normal modes M is roughly proportional to the ocean depth h and the angular frequency ω. The signal vectors at the VLA are independent of the bearings because of the cylindrical symmetry of the range independent ocean, and hence we havepV(xj)=pV(uj)whereuj=(rj,zj). The elements ofpV(uj)are given by [18](8)pVn(uj)=∑m=1MΨm(zVn)Ψm(zj)e(ikm−αm)rjkmrj;n=1,…,NV,wherezVnis the depth of nth sensor of VLA. Using Buckingham's model [19] for ambient noise in a homogeneous shallow water channel, the correlation of noise for two vertically separated sensors at depthsziandzjcan be well approximated as(9)γij=β(sin[(M+12)(z¯i−z¯j)]sin[12(z¯i−z¯j)]−1),wherez¯i=πzihis the normalized depth of the ith sensor, h is the depth of the water column, M is the number of normal modes, and β is a scaling factor. Eq. (9) indicates that the noise field is homogeneous, i.e. the variance is independent of depth and the correlation depends only on the vertical separation between sensors. Eq. (9) is valid over the central portion of the water column that lies approximately between the depths3λ/(4sinχc)and[h−3λ/(4sinχc)], whereλ=2πc/ωis the wavelength in water andχc=cos−1(c/cb)is the critical grazing angle of the ocean bottom. It follows from (9) that, for a VLA with an inter-sensor spacingdV, noise may be considered to be spatially uncorrelated ifdV≥hM+12. In the case of the HLA, noise may be assumed to be spatially uncorrelated if the inter-sensor spacingdHis greater than or equal toλ/2(half-wavelength). Assuming thatdHanddVsatisfy the above-mentioned conditions, it follows that the noise field at the hybrid array is spatially white. We shall further assume that the noise random variables{wH,i(t),wV,j(t);i=1,…,NH;j=1,…,NV;t=1,…,K}are iid with marginal PDF given by the L-component Gaussian mixture(10)fW(w¯,w̿)=∑l=1Lλl2πσl2exp(−w¯2+w̿22σl2).The PDF in (10) is a circularly symmetric bivariate PDF for the complex-valued random variableW=W¯+iW̿. The GM has the ability of modeling a variety of different probability distributions including those representing heavy-tailed/impulsive noise. A relatively small value of L is usually adequate to obtain a good model in most applications. The parameterλlis the weight of the lth component in the Gaussian mixture, i.e.λlis the probability that the noise at any sensor at any time instant is a sample value of the lth term in the Gaussian mixture PDF, with∑l=1Lλl=1. The variance of W is given by(11)σ2=2∑l=1Lλlσl2.The covariance matrix of the HLA and VLA noise vectors are given by(12)CH=E[wH(t)wH(t)H]=σ2INH,CV=E[wV(t)wV(t)H]=σ2INV.For the hybrid array, the data vectory(t)=[y1(t)…yN(t)]T, the associated steering matrixP(x)and steering vectorsp(xj), and the noise vectorw(t)=[w1(t)…wN(t)]Tmay be expressed as(13)y(t)=[yH(t)TyV(t)T]T=P(x)s(t)+w(t),P(x)=[PH(x)TPV(x)T]T=[p(x1)…p(xJ)],p(xj)=[pH(xj)TpV(xj)T]T,w(t)=[wH(t)TwV(t)T]T.The set of unknown parameters in this problem is as follows(14)Φ={x,sj(t),λl,σl2,t=1,…,K;j=1,…,J;l=1,…,L}.The first step in this algorithm is an initialization procedure that produces rough estimates of the unknown parameters, and it is followed by a SAGE based approach for updating the initial estimates iteratively. These two steps are explained in the following subsections.Initial estimates of the noise parameters are obtained using the expressions proposed by Kozick and Sadler [13]. Datay(t)from the full hybrid array (both HLA and VLA) is used to obtain the following estimates(15)λ1′=0.8,λ2′=…=λL′=0.2L−1,σ1′2=0.5(σ¯/0.7)2,σL′2=0.5max{|yn(t)|2;n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K},σl′2=(σL′2/σ1′2)1/(L−1)σl−1′2forl=2,…,L−1,σ¯=median{|yn(t)|;n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K}.The initial estimates ofσl2are based on the assumption that the signal is weak compared to noise.The number of sources J is estimated using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion [15]. This approach involves estimation of the array data correlation matrix from a finite number of snapshots. When the noise is heavy-tailed, the estimate of the correlation matrix is prone to large errors due to the occurrence of large noise impulses. The correlation matrix estimation can be rendered robust by preprocessing the data so as to suppress the effect of the large impulses. The data-adaptive zero-memory nonlinear preprocessor (DA-ZMNL) used in [13] is therefore employed to process each sample of transformed datayn(t)to obtain(16)zn(t)={yn(t),|yn(t)|≤τyn(t)|yn(t)|τexp(−(|yn(t)|−τ)22σ1′2),|yn(t)|>τ;τ=32σ1′+σ¯.The DA-ZMNL in (16) incorporates an initial linear part and an exponentially decaying tail. Any received sample below the threshold τ is assumed to contain no impulsive component and is passed unchanged. Samples above the threshold are assumed to be corrupted by a large noise impulse and are suppressed (bounded on Gaussian tails). Letz(t),zH(t)andzV(t)denote the vectors obtained by preprocessing the data vectorsy(t),yH(t)andyV(t)measured, respectively, by the full hybrid array, the HLA and the VLA. The correlation matrices of these data vectors are estimated as(17)Rˆ=1K∑t=1Kz(t)zH(t),RˆH=1K∑t=1KzH(t)zHH(t),RˆV=1K∑t=1KzV(t)zVH(t).Letη1,…,ηNdenote the eigenvalues ofRˆin ascending order. The estimate of the number of sources is given by(18)Jˆ=argmaxj{−log[∏i=1N−jηi1/(N−j)1N−j∑i=1N−jηi](N−j)K+12j(2N−j)log(K)}.Initial estimates of the source positions are obtained using a subspace based approach. Initial range–depth estimates of all sources are obtained by applying the 2-D MUSIC algorithm to the VLA data. The 2-D MUSIC spectrum is defined as [3](19)BMUSIC(u)=1pV(u)HEVNEVNHpV(u),whereEVNis the noise subspace matrix obtained from eigen decomposition of the estimated correlation matrixRˆV. The J largest peaks ofBMUSIC(u)provide the initial range–depth estimatesuj′=(rj′,zj′);j=1,…,J. These estimates do not require prior knowledge of the source bearings due to the cylindrical symmetry of the range independent ocean.Initial bearing estimates are obtained from the HLA data using the R-MUSIC-mdf algorithm developed recently by Xu and Liu [7]. Conventional methods of bearing estimation in non-Gaussian noise, such as the Bartlett, Capon, and MUSIC processors [1–3], require either a computationally expensive 3-D search or prior knowledge of range and depth of the sources. R-MUSIC-mdf belongs to the class of bearing estimation methods using a 1-D search without prior knowledge of source ranges and depths. Other methods in this class include SIM [4] and R-MUSIC [6]. These methods exploit the normal mode structure of the acoustic field generated by the sources, and the fact that theNH-dimensional signal vector due to each source belongs to an M-dimensional subspace ifNH>M. Among these methods, we have chosen the R-MUSIC-mdf algorithm because it is computationally simpler than SIM and also provides a uniformly better performance than R-MUSIC. The spectrum of R-MUSIC-mdf is given by(20)BRM(θ)=sum{T−1(θ)},(21)T(θ)=AH(θ)EHNEHNHA(θ)+vrIM,whereEHNis the noise subspace matrix obtained from eigen decomposition of estimated correlation matrixRˆHof the HLA data vector,A(θ)is the modal steering matrix defined in (6),vris a regularization parameter,IMis theM×Midentity matrix, and sum(.) denotes the summation of all elements of a matrix. The value ofvris chosen experimentally so as to minimize the mean square estimation error. The J largest peaks of the spectrum defined in (20) provide the initial bearing estimatesθj′;j=1,…,J.We have thus obtained J initial range–depth estimatesui′,i=1,…,Jand J initial bearing estimatesθj′;j=1,…,J, using one 2-D search and one 1-D search. There exist J! ways of associating the J range–depth estimates with the J bearing estimates. The ambiguity is resolved by computing the 3-D Bartlett spectrum [1] from the ZMNL-processed hybrid array data at theJ2points(ui′,θj′);i,j=1,…,Jand employing a simple search-maximize-discard procedure to determine the correct association. At each of these points, we compute the 3-D Bartlett spectrum of the DA-ZNML processed data(22)BBartlett(u,θ)=pH(u,θ)Rˆp(u,θ),wherep(u,θ)is the replica of signal vector due to a unit source at(u,θ). The location of the largest peak of Bartlett spectrum (22) is assigned to the first source (e.g.(u1′,θ1′)). We discard all points containing eitheru1′orθ1′as one of the coordinates from the original set ofJ2points. Now only(J−1)2points remain. By finding the location of the largest peak of (22) among the remaining points, the location of the second source is obtained and its coordinates are removed from the original set. This procedure is continued until the association for J sources is complete.Initial estimate of the signal vector envelope{s(t);t=1,...,K}is obtained as the best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) [20], using the ZMNL-processed hybrid array dataz(t)and the initial source position estimatesx′. This estimate is given by the equation(23)s′(t)={P(x′)HP(x′)}−1P(x′)Hz(t);t=1,…,K.The initial estimates are updated iteratively using the SAGE algorithm. While the basic approach is the same as that adopted by Kozick and Sadler [13] to solve the one-dimensional problem of DOA estimation, several variations have been introduced to cater to the complexities arising out of the higher dimensionality of the present problem and the use of a hybrid array. Details of the algorithm are described below.The set of unknown parameters Φ defined in (14) is partitioned into five subsets as follows(24)Φ1={θ1,…,θJ},Φ2={r1,…,rJ},Φ3={z1,…,zJ},Φ4={sj(t);t=1,…,K;j=1,…,J},Φ5={λ1,…,λL,σ12,…,σL2},so thatΦ=Φ1∪Φ2∪Φ3∪Φ4∪Φ5. A sequential updating procedure is used, wherein estimates of parameters in one subset are updated at a time while the values of all other parameters are held fixed at their current estimated values. The current estimate of an unknown parameter ϕ is denoted byϕ′.In the EM-algorithm (and also the SAGE algorithm), the observed data is regarded as an incomplete data set. This incomplete data set D is augmented by some hidden data (unobservable data) to generate a complete data setDC. The hidden data is chosen so that maximization of the likelihood function of the complete dataDCis easier than maximization of the likelihood function of the incomplete data D. The EM algorithm involves an iterative implementation of the following two steps:1.E-step: Find the expectation of log-likelihood function of the complete data setDCconditioned on the incomplete (observable) data D and the current estimateΦ′of the parameter set Φ. Let this expectation be denoted byQ(Φ|Φ′).M-step: MaximizeQ(Φ|Φ′)with respect to Φ. In the present problem, the maximization is done sequentially with respect to each subsetΦiof Φ, after assigning the current estimated values to the other subsets of Φ.In the present problem, the incomplete data set D is(25)D={y(t);t=1,…,K}={yn(t);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K}.When noise is modeled as a Gaussian mixture, each noise samplewn(t)may be regarded as being randomly selected from a set of Gaussian random variables{N(0,σl2);l=1,…,L}, the probability of selecting the lth member of the set beingλl. It is therefore convenient to augment the data D by a hidden data set{ln(t);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K}whose members are iid random variables with the conditional probability distribution(26)p(ln(t)=l|Φ)=λl;l=1,…,L.In multiple source localization problems, it is also convenient to consider the following unobservable data vectors(27)y(j)(t)=[y1(j)(t)…yN(j)(t)]T;j=1,…,J.In (27),yn(j)(t)is the unobservable data at sensor n due to source j, satisfying the constraint(28)∑j=1Jyn(j)(t)=yn(t);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K,whereyn(t)is the observation at sensor n at time t. Therefore, following Kozick and Sadler [13], we introduce two sets of complete dataDC1andDC2, defined as(29)DC1={yn(t),ln(t);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K},(30)DC2={yn(j)(t),ln(t);j=1,…,J;n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K},whereDC1is the less informative complete data set andDC2is the more informative complete data set. The constraint (28) is satisfied by defining(31)y(j)(t)=p(xj)sj(t)+w(j)(t);j=1,…,J,wherep(xj)=[p1(xj)…pN(xj)]Kis the array signal vector defined in (13) due to a unit source atxjandw(j)(t)=[w1(j)(t)…wN(j)(t)]T, where{wn(j)(t);j=1,…,J;n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K}are iid random variables satisfying the equation(32)∑j=1Jwn(j)(t)=wn(t);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K,andwn(t)is the noise at sensor n at time t. We also note thatwn(t)andwn(j)(t)are Gaussian when conditioned onln(t), and therefore we have(33)wn(t)|ln(t)∼N(0,σln(t)2);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K(34)wn(j)(t)|ln(t)∼N(0,1Jσln(t)2);j=1,…,J;n=1,…,N;t=1,…,KWe shall also define the J-dimensional vectors(35)y˘n(t)=[yn(1)(t)…yn(J)(t)]T;n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K.Sincewn(j)(t)are independent over j, n and t, we can write the following expressions for the conditional PDFs of the complete data(36)f(yn(t),ln(t)|Φ)=∑l=1Lλlδ(ln(t)−l)2πσln(t)2exp[−12σln2(t)|yn(t)−∑j=1Jpn(xj)sj(t)|2],(37)f(y˘n(t),ln(t)|Φ)=∑l=1Lλlδ(ln(t)−l)(2πσln(t)2/J)Jexp[−12σln(t)2/J∑j=1J|yn(j)(t)−pn(xj)sj(t)|2],whereδ(.)denotes the Dirac delta function.The log-likelihood functions of the complete data setsDC1andDC2, conditioned on Φ, can be written as(38)L(DC1|Φ)=∑t=1K∑n=1Nlogf(yn(t),ln(t)|Φ)(39)L(DC2|Φ)=∑t=1K∑n=1Nlogf(y˘n(t),ln(t)|Φ).The likelihood functions in (38) and (39) are not known sinceln(t)andy˘n(t)are not observable. The E-step of the SAGE algorithm consists of finding the expectations ofL(DCi|Φ),i=1,2conditioned on the available observations{yn(t);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K}and the current estimatesΦ′. The conditional expectation ofL(DCi|Φ)can be written as(40)Q1(Φ|Φ′)≜E[L(DC1|Φ)|{yn(t);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K},Φ′]=B1+∑t=1K∑n=1N∑l=1L[logλl−logσl2−12σl2|yn(t)−∑j=1Jpn(xj′)sj′(t)|2]gl,n,t′(yn(t)),wheregl,n,t′=P(ln(t)|yn(t),Φ′)is the conditional probability ofln(t)defined in (41), andB1is independent of the parameters Φ. Recalling thatyn(t)|{ln(t)=l,Φ′}∼N(∑j=1Jpn(xj′)sj′(t),σl′2),P(ln(t)=l|Φ′)=λl′,and employing Bayes' rule, we get(41)gl,n,t′(yn(t))≜P(ln(t)|yn(t),Φ′)=λl′2πσl′2exp(−12σl′2|yn(t)−∑j=1Jpn(xj′)sj′(t)|2)∑q=1Lλq′2πσq′2exp(−12σq′2|yn(t)−∑j=1Jpn(xj′)sj′(t)|2);l=1,…,L;n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K.The conditional expectation ofL(DC2|Φ)requires the conditional estimate ofy˘n(t). The estimate ofyn(j)(t)conditioned on{yn(t);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K}and the current estimates ofxjandsj(t)can be written as(42)y˘n′(t)=[yn(1)′(t)…yn(J)′(t)]T;n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K.(43)yn(j)′(t)=pn(xj′)sj′(t)+1J[yn(t)−∑j=1Jpn(xj′)sj′(t)];j=1,…,J;n=1,…,N.On the right hand side of (43), the first term is the conditional estimate of the signal from the jth source at sensor n and time t, and the second term is the conditional estimate of the noisewn(j)(t). On replacingy˘n(t)byy˘n′(t)in (39), the conditional expectation ofL(DC2|Φ)can be written as(44)Q2(Φ|Φ′)≜E[L(DC2|Φ)|{yn(t);n=1,…,N;t=1,…,K},Φ′]=B2+∑t=1K∑n=1N∑l=1L[logλl−Jlogσl2−J2σl2∑j=1J|yn(j)′(t)−pn(xj′)sj′(t)|2]gl,n,t′(yn(t)),whereB2is independent of Φ.The M-step of the SAGE algorithm consists of maximizing eitherQ1(Φ|Φ′)orQ2(Φ|Φ′)with respect to each parameter in the set Φ holding the other parameters in Φ fixed at their current values. In each cycle of iteration, the updating is done in the following sequence until all the parameters are updated.At the start of each iteration, the conditional probabilitiesgl,n,t(yn(t))defined in (41) are updated using the current estimates of Φ. The estimate of each source parameter in the setΦ1∪Φ2∪Φ3is updated using the more informative complete data setDC2by maximizingQ2(Φ|Φ′)with respect to that parameter after assigning the current estimates to the other parameters. The condition∂Q2(Φ|Φ′)∂sj(t)=0yields the conditional estimate(45)sj′(t|xj′)=p(xj′)HHt′(y(t))y(j)′(t)p(xj′)HHt′(y(t))p(xj′),where(46)H′t(y(t))=diag(∑l=1L1σl′2gl,1,t′(y1(t)),…,∑l=1L1σl′2gl,N,t′(yN(t)));t=1,…,K.On replacingsj′(t)bysj′(t|xj′)in (44) and maximizingQ2(Φ|Φ′)with respect toxj′, we get the following updated estimate ofxj(47)xj′=argmaxxj∑t=1K{[p(xj)HHt′(y(t))p(xj)]−1|p(xj)HHt′(y(t))y(j)′(t)|2};j=1,…,J.Determination ofxj′from (47) requires a computationally expensive 3-D search. An approximate evaluation ofxj′is therefore obtained by replacing the 3-D search by three sequential 1-D searches. The range is updated first using the equation(48)rj′=argmaxr∑t=1K{[p(xj′(r))HHt′(y(t))p(xj′(r))]−1|p(xj′(r))HHt′(y(t))y(j)′(t)|2};j=1,…,J,wherexj′(r)=(r,zj′,θj′), andθj′,zj′are the current estimates ofθjandzjrespectively. The depth is updated next using the equation(49)zj′=argmaxz∑t=1K{[p(xj′(z))HHt′(y(t))p(xj′(z))]−1|p(xj′(z))HHt′(y(t))y(j)′(t)|2};j=1,…,J,wherexj′(z)=(rj′,z,θj′). The range and depth are estimated using the full hybrid array datay(t). The bearing may be estimated next in a similar fashion using the full hybrid array data to obtain(50)θj′=argmaxθ∑t=1K{[p(xj′(θ))HHt′(y(t))p(xj′(θ))]−1|p(xj′(θ))HHt′(y(t))y(j)′(t)|2};j=1,…,J,wherexj′(θ)=(rj′,zj′,θ). Alternatively, bearing updates may also be obtained using only the HLA datayH(t)instead of the full hybrid array datay(t), since the VLA signal vector is insensitive to change in bearing. Range–depth estimates are updated before updating the bearing estimates for the following reason. The VLA plays the dominant role in range–depth estimation, and the VLA signal vector is not sensitive to variations in bearing. On the other hand, only the HLA data plays a role in bearing estimation, and the HLA signal vector is sensitive to variations in range–depth. Hence, availability of better range–depth estimates reduces the updated bearing estimation error. Consequently, updating the range–depth estimates prior to updating the bearing estimates leads to faster convergence of the algorithm. The updated estimates of signal envelopes in (45) and the source coordinates in (48)–(50) are used to update the conditional probabilitiesgl,n,t′(yn(t))in (41) and the matrix functionsHt′(y(t))in (46).The estimate of the signal vector envelope{s′(t)=[s1′(t)…sJ′(t)]T;t=1,…,K}is then updated from the less informative complete data setDC1by applying the condition∂Q1(Φ|Φ′)∂s(t)=0, to obtain(51)s′(t)=[P(x′)HHt′(y(t))P(x′)]−1[P(x′)HHt′(y(t))y(t)],t=1,…,K.The updates in (51) are an improved version of the updates in (45). Next, the conditional probabilitiesgl,n,t′(yn(t))and the matrix functionsHt′(y(t))are updated once again using the updated values ofsj′(t)obtained from (51).Finally, the noise parameters{λl,σl2;l=1,…,L}are updated from the less informative data setDC1by maximizingQ1(Φ|Φ′)with respect toΦ5after assigningΦi=Φi′fori=1,…,4. The conditions{∂Q1(Φ|Φ′)∂λl=0,∂Q1(Φ|Φ′)∂σl2=0,l=1,…,L}, subject to the constraint∑l=1Lλl=1, yield the estimates(52)λl′=1NK∑n=1N∑t=1Kg′l,n,t(yn(t)),l=1,…,L.(53)σl′2=12NKλl′∑t=1K[y(t)−p(x′)s′(t)]HG′l,t(y(t))[y(t)−p(x′)s′(t)],l=1,…,L,where(54)G′l,t(y(t))=diag{g′l,1,t(y1(t)),…,g′l,N,t(yN(t))},l=1,…,L.Estimates of the signal envelopes and noise parameters are updated by using the closed form expressions in (45) and (51)–(53). But updating the estimates of source-coordinates involves maximization of the objective functions in (48)–(50) through a search procedure. To reduce the computational complexity of the search we use the algorithm for adaptive shrinkage of the search space proposed by Chung and Bohme [21]. Let[aj[0],bj[0]]denote the search interval for parameterϕjfor the first iteration, and letϕj[i]be the estimate ofϕjafter the ith iteration. Define(55)Δj[i]=|ϕj[i]−ϕj[i−1]|.The end points of the search interval[aj[i],bj[i]]for the(i+1)st iteration are given by(56)aj[i]=aj[0],bj[i]=bj[0],fori=1,2aj[i]={aj[0],Δj[i]>Δj[i−1]ϕj[i]−cΔj[i],otherwise;bj[i]={bj[0],Δj[i]>Δj[i−1]ϕj[i]+cΔj[i],otherwise;fori>2,where c is a constant greater than 1. The rate of shrinkage of the search space is measured by the ratio(57)ρj[i]=Δj[i+1]Δj[i].Sincec>1, the ratioρj[i]may be larger than 1 for small i. But the control loop ensures thatρj[i]begins to converge and tends to zero. Convergence is said to have occurred if the difference between the current and the previous location estimates is below a prescribed threshold[γr,γz,γθ]for two successive iterations. A summary of the SAGE-USL algorithm is given in Fig. 1.Some remarks on the convergence of the SAGE-USL algorithm are given here. In a multi-parameter estimation problem such as the present one, generalized EM algorithms (e.g. SAGE) are preferred to the pure EM algorithm because the former involve updating of parameters in smaller groups rather than updating all the parameters simultaneously [22]. In general, the complete data set required for estimating each group of parameters is smaller than the complete data set required for estimating the entire set of unknown parameters. The likelihood function in a generalized EM algorithm is non-decreasing for all estimates of each unknown parameter [23], no matter whether they are obtained from separate complete data sets or from one single complete data set. In the SAGE-USL algorithm, we have used two complete data sets, viz., the less informative data setDC1and the more informative data setDC2. The convergence of the SAGE algorithm with different complete data sets (including complete data sets similar toDC1andDC2) has been analyzed and demonstrated in [12,24,25]. It has been shown in [22] that the use of a less informative complete data set leads to faster convergence. In view of the foregoing remarks, the SAGE-USL algorithm is expected to have good convergence properties. A detailed evaluation of convergence of the SAGE-USL algorithm is presented in Section 6.In this section we derive the Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) on the variance of any unbiased estimator for multiple source localization by a hybrid array in a channel with complex additive noise with circularly symmetric PDF. The data vectory(t)can be expressed as(58)y(t)=∑j=1Jp(xj)sj(t)+w(t)=P(x)s(t)+w(t),t=1,…,K.Eq. (58) has the same form as Eq. (1) of Kozick and Sadler [13] except that the source positionxjis a 3-dimensional vector instead of a scalar. Hence, following the procedure in Appendix A of [13], we can arrive at the following expression for the CRB:(59)CRB(x)=1Ic(Λ){∑t=1KRe[S(t)HQ(x)H(I−P(x)(P(x)HP(x))−1P(x)H)Q(x)S(t)]}−1,where(60)Ic(Λ)=π∫0∞[fw′(ρ)]2fw(ρ)ρdρ,ρ=w¯2+w̿2,(61)Q(x)=[∂p(x1)∂r1∂p(x1)∂z1∂p(x1)∂θ1…∂p(xJ)∂rJ∂p(xJ)∂zJ∂p(xJ)∂θJ],and(62)S(t)=diag(s1(t),…,sJ(t))⊗I3(t)is a3J×3Jdiagonal matrix and ⊗ denotes the Kronecker product. For a hybrid array, we haveP(x)=[p(x1)…p(xJ)],p(xj)=[pH(xj)TpV(xj)T]T. The CRB can be computed using the expressions forpH(xj)andpV(xj)defined in (4)–(8).For the Gaussian mixture noise PDF defined in (10),Ic(Λ)in (60) can be computed from the following expression numerically.(63)Ic(λ1,…,λL,σ12,…,σL2)=12π∫0∞∑l=1L∑m=1Lλlλmσl4σm4exp[−ρ22(1ρl2+1ρm2)]∑r=1Lλrσr2exp[−ρ22σr2]ρ3dρ.Complexity of an algorithm is measured in terms of number of elementary operations used in the algorithm. We shall compare the complexities of the SAGE-USL algorithm and the 3-D MUSIC algorithm in terms of the O-notation [26]. The SAGE-USL algorithm includes an initialization stage to obtain initial estimates of all unknown parameters followed by a SAGE based algorithm to update the initial estimates. To compute the complexity of SAGE-USL algorithm, we consider the following computations which are the relatively more time consuming steps in the algorithm:•Estimation of correlation matrix and its eigen decompositionR-MUSIC-mdf for initial estimate of source bearings2-D MUSIC for initial estimate of source ranges and depthsSAGE algorithm for updating bearing, range and depth estimatesN: Number of total sensors,N=NH+NV−1NH: Number of sensors in HLANV: Number of sensors in VLAK: Number of snapshots (samples) in a frame of dataM: Number of normal modes in shallow oceanNθ: Number of positions searched in bearing spaceNr: Number of positions searched in range spaceNz: Number of positions searched in depth spaceNitr: Number of iterations of SAGE algorithm in SAGE-USLWe have shown in Section 6 that the number of iterations required for convergence of the algorithm is not large (<10). A comparison of Tables 1 and 2 shows that the complexity of SAGE-USL algorithm is significantly lower than that of 3-D MUSIC. Recalling thatN=NH+NV−1, we observe that entries in rows 1 and 2 of Table 2 are larger than the corresponding entries in Table 1. The entry in row 3 of Table 2 is much larger than the sum of the entries in rows 3–7 of Table 1. To show this, we assumeNθ=300,Nz=100,Nr=200,K=100,NV=10,NH=20,Nitr=6. On substituting these values in Tables 1 and 2, the complexity of SAGE-USL and 3-D MUSIC will beO(108)andO(1011)respectively. We observe that SAGE-USL has 1000 times less complexity than 3-D MUSIC for the search space considered in this example. The computational advantage of SAGE-USL becomes even more significant if a larger search volume is considered.In this section, simulation results for evaluation of the proposed algorithm are presented and discussed. We consider a T-shaped array composed of an HLA withNH=20and a VLA withNV=10sensors. Inter-sensor distance isd=7.5min both HLA and VLA. Ocean depth ish=100m, sound speed in water is1500m/s, sound speed in the bottom is1700m/s, bottom attenuation is0.5dB/wavelength, and density ratio is 1.5. The HLA is placed at a depth of60min the ocean and the top-most sensor of the VLAs is positioned at a depthz1=15m. Signals from narrowband sources of central frequency100Hzare considered. At this frequency, the number of modes isM=6. Non-Gaussian noise is generated using a GMM with two components. All results are based on 150–200 Monte Carlo simulations.The PDF of the 2-component GM noise can be written as(64)fcgm(w)=(1−λ2)l2πσ12exp[−w¯2+w̿22σ12]+λ2l2πσ22exp[−w¯2+w̿22σ22].Eq. (64) implies that the noise isCN(0,2σ12)with probability1−λ2andCN(0,2σ22)with probabilityλ2. The noise variance is(65)σ2=2[(1−λ2)σ12+λ2σ22].The degree of non-Gaussianity of a PDF is typically measured by its kurtosis, which is defined for a zero-mean complex circular random variable as [27](66)κ=E[|w|4]{E[|w|2]}2−2.It can be readily shown that the kurtosis for the PDF defined in (64) is given by(67)κ=32[λ2(u4−1)+1(λ2(u2−1)+1)2−1],whereu2=σ22/σ12. κ is non-negative for all values ofλ2andu2. We can assume without any loss of generality thatu2≥1. Foru2=1, noise is Gaussian andκ=0. For a givenλ2and foru2≥1, κ increases monotonically asu2is increased. For a givenu2>1, κ attains the maximum value of3(u2−1)28u2atλ2=1(u2+1). Thus kurtosis may be made arbitrarily large by increasingu2and choosingλ2≃1/u2. Fig. 2(a) shows plots of κ versusu2for two different values ofλ2, and Fig. 2(b) shows plots of κ versusλ2for two different values ofu2. We are interested in considering heavy-tailed noise with a large kurtosis, which corresponds to large values ofu2, typicallyu2≥100and small values ofλ2, typicallyλ2≤0.2. Results of simulations conducted to assess the performance of the SAGE-USL algorithm under different conditions are presented below.In the first experiment, we evaluate the performance of the proposed SAGE-USL algorithm by comparing the root mean square error (RMSE) of range, depth and bearing estimates with those of 3-D MUSIC and CRBs. In all the figures, CRB denotes the lower bound on the standard deviation (STD) of the estimation error. 3-D MUSIC algorithm is applied to the data after applying DA-ZMNL preprocessor to ensure a fair comparison with the SAGE-USL algorithm. In this experiment, we have considered two point sources of the same frequencyf=100Hzlocated atr1=4000m,z1=40m,θ1=30°andr2=5000m,z2=60m,θ2=40°. Bearings are measured with respect to the endfire direction of the HLA. Parameters of the GMM noise areσ12=1,σ22=1000andλ2=0.1. The results are shown in Fig. 3. RMSEs of the initial range–depth estimate by 2D-MUSIC (19) using the VLA, and the initial bearing estimate by R-MUSIC-mdf ((20)–(21)) using the HLA are also plotted in this figure to demonstrate the improvement in performance due to the iterative updates performed by the SAGE-USL algorithm. It is seen that the SAGE-USL algorithm provides a significant reduction in RMSE not only over 3-D MUSIC but also over the initial estimates provided by 2-D MUSIC and R-MUSIC-mdf. CRBs of source coordinates are also presented in Fig. 3 for comparison. It is observed that the range, depth and bearing RMSEs are close to the corresponding CRBs.In the second simulation (Figs. 4–5), we study the effect of variation of the GM noise parameters on the performance of the SAGE-USL algorithm. As indicated by Fig. 2, non-Gaussianity may be varied either by varying the frequencyλ2of the large-variance component or by varying the ratio of variancesu2=σ22/σ12. Fig. 4 shows the effect of varyingu2for two fixed values ofλ2, viz.λ2=0.05andλ2=0.2. Values of noise varianceσ2=250,SNR=−5dB, and the source location are also held fixed. The three panels in this figure show plots of RMSEs of range, depth and bearing estimates versusu2. Plots of the corresponding CRBs are also shown in this figure. It is seen that the CRBs decrease with increasingu2, and the same trend is followed by the RMSEs. This trend may be explained by observing from Fig. 2(a) that kurtosis increases asu2is increased, and the increase in non-Gaussianity leads to a reduction in CRB.Fig. 5 shows the effect of varyingλ2for two fixed values ofu2, viz.u2=100andu2=1000. It is seen that there is a sharp initial decrease in the values of RMSEs and CRBs asλ2is increased. This initial trend may be predicted from Fig. 2(b) which shows an initial increase in kurtosis at small values ofλ2. It is also observed from Figs. 4 and 5 that the values of RMSEs are very close to the values of the corresponding CRBs over almost the entire range of the noise parameter values.It is also of interest to compare the 3-D localization performance of SAGE-USL for different array configurations (viz. HLA, VLA, and hybrid array), and to study the dependence of the localization errors on the source coordinates. For this study, we consider a hybrid array and an HLA of 29 sensors each and a VLA of 10 sensors. Inter-sensor spacing is7.5mfor all the arrays. Values of other parameters are source depthz1=40m, bearingθ1=30°,u2=1000,λ2=0.1,SNR=−5dB. Fig. 6shows the plots of CRB versus range. Similar plots of CRB versus source depth and CRB versus bearing are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. In view of the closeness between the RMSEs and the corresponding CRBs observed in Figs. 3–5, we can expect the variation of RMSEs with range, source depth and bearing to closely follow the trend of the CRBs. We draw the following conclusions from Figs. 6–8. Variations in range, source depth, or bearing have very little effect on the 3-D localization performance of the hybrid array. The range–depth estimation performance of the 10-sensor VLA is almost as good as that of the 30-sensor hybrid array. Improvement in the range–depth estimation performance due to the addition of the 20-sensor HLA to the 10-sensor VLA is negligible. But the VLA cannot estimate bearing whereas the hybrid array can. The HLA has poor range–depth estimation performance for sources near the broadside direction (θ=90°) and poor bearing estimation performance for sources near the endfire direction (θ=0°or 180°). In general, the CRBs and RMSEs for the HLA are larger respectively than the corresponding CRBs and RMSEs for the hybrid array. It is also seen that changes in source range and depth cause fluctuations in the CRBs for the HLA, unlike the CRBs for the hybrid array. The poorer performance of the HLA may be explained as follows. The signal vector at an HLA has much lower sensitivity to variations of range and depth of a source as compared to the signal vector at a VLA. Therefore, the range–depth estimates provided by the HLA are less accurate than those provided by a VLA. But a VLA cannot be used for bearing estimation due to the cylindrical symmetry of the oceanic waveguide. A hybrid array combines the advantages of the VLA and the HLA. Therefore, the 3-D localization performance of a hybrid array is better than that of the HLA.In the last experiment, we study the convergence rate of SAGE-USL algorithm by computing the average number of iterations required for convergence. Convergence is said to have occurred if the difference between the updated estimates and the previous estimates is below a prescribed threshold (1mfor range estimates,0.1mfor depth estimates and 0.001° for bearing estimates) for two successive iterations for all the source coordinates. The average number of iterations,N¯itr, required for convergence under different conditions is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9(a) shows the variation ofN¯itrwith SNR for localization of two sources at two different values ofσ22. Values of all the other parameters are the same as in the first experiment (corresponding to Fig. 3). It is observed thatN¯itr≃6, and it increases a little at very low SNR (SNR≤−15dB). Figs. 9(b) and 9(c) show the variation ofN¯itrwith the noise parametersu2andλ2respectively, for the problem of single-source localization. All the experimental conditions in these plots are identical to those in the second experiment (corresponding to Figs. 4 and 5). It is seen thatN¯itr≃2for small values ofλ2. The value ofN¯itrincreases steadily for larger values ofλ2, probably because of the steadily decreasing effectiveness of the ZMNL preprocessor.
