@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are the substantial ingredients for cell growth and viability, which are found in all living organisms. HSPs manage the process of folding and unfolding of proteins, the quality of newly synthesized proteins and protecting cellular homeostatic processes from environmental stress. On the basis of functionality, HSPs are categorized into six major families namely: (i) HSP20 or sHSP (ii) HSP40 or J-proteins types (iii) HSP60 or GroEL/ES (iv) HSP70 (v) HSP90 and (vi) HSP100. Identification of HSPs family and sub-family through conventional approaches is expensive and laborious. It is therefore, highly desired to establish an automatic, robust and accurate computational method for prediction of HSPs quickly and reliably. Regard, a computational model is developed for the prediction of HSPs family. In this model, protein sequences are formulated using three discrete methods namely: Split Amino Acid Composition, Pseudo Amino Acid Composition, and Dipeptide Composition. Several learning algorithms are utilized to choice the best one for high throughput computational model. Leave one out test is applied to assess the performance of the proposed model. The empirical results showed that support vector machine achieved quite promising results using Dipeptide Composition feature space. The predicted outcomes of proposed model are 90.7% accuracy for HSPs dataset and 97.04% accuracy for J-protein types, which are higher than existing methods in the literature so far.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are essential constituent for the cell growth and survival, which exists in all living organisms ranging from bacteria to archaea [1–3]. They were first discovered in 1962 [1,2]. The main function of HSPs is to control the folding and unfolding process of proteins [4,5]. It is also called stress proteins because they prevent the unalterable aggregation of misfolded proteins under stress conditions like stress or high temperature, etc. [4]. HSPs play a vital role in protecting cellular homeostatic processes from environmental and physiologic stress [6] and in protein–protein interaction like unwanted protein disaggregation and establish proper protein conformation. The expression levels of HSPs that are functionally related proteins increased when the cells are exposed to physiological and environmental stress condition such as high temperature, infection and swelling [7,8]. They are also involved in a large variety of cellular processes like protein assembly, maturation, assisting protein folding, degradation of misfolded proteins, intercellular trafficking, modulating signaling pathways and regulating immune responses [3,9,10]. To control the quality of newly synthesized proteins, HSPs take part in cellular homeostasis [10]. More recently, HSPs have been implicated as a biological factor in anti-tumor immunity, oncogenesis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune reactions [11–14]. HSPs are categorized into six different families on the basis of nature and functionality [2,15]. These families are: (i) HSP20 or sHSP (Small Heat Shock Proteins), (ii) HSP40 or J-proteins, (iii) HSP60 or GroEL/ES, (iv) HSP70, (v) HSP90, and (vi) HSP100 [2,3,15]. HSP40 or J-proteins is further divided into four different types, that is, Type-1, Type-2, Type-3 and Type-4 [3,16]. Owing to the diversified nature and vast repertoire functions of HSPs, they have got considerable attention of the researchers. In this regards, extensive studies have been carried out in order to distinguish HSPs from other proteins. A series of efforts have been performed for identification of HSPs families from other proteins and reasonable results have been achieved [2]. In contrast, owing to huge exploration of proteins sequences and lack of recognized structures in databases, conventional methods like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were inadequate for identifying HSPs families [17–20]. In such circumstances, computational methods were utilized for the identification of HSPs and J-protein types. In last few decades, numerous methods have been utilized for identification of HSPs and J-protein types [2]. More recently the notion of reduce alphabet amino acid composition method (RAAAC) was applied by different researchers and achieved remarkable results. Further it has been used in various area of computational biology, such as prediction of DNA-binding proteins [21], prediction of defensin family and subfamilies [22] and prediction of bioluminescent proteins [23]. Similarly, Feng et al. [2] have used RAAAC and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for prediction of HSPs families and obtained maximum overall accuracy 87.82%. In addition, Feng et al. also developed the first automated method for the discrimination of J-protein types and obtained the overall accuracy of 94% [16]. As summarized and demonstrated by a series of publication [2,24–32], in compliance with Chou's 5-step rule [33], to develop a convenient sequence-based prediction model for a biological system, the following procedures are necessary to consider: the first step is to choose or establish a valid benchmark dataset in order to train and test the predictor; the second step is to express the biological sequences into effective mathematical formula that can truly represent their intrinsic correlation with the target to be predicted; the third step is to introduce or develop a powerful learning algorithm; the fourth step is to perform statistical cross-validation tests to assess the performance of the predictor; and finally develop a user-friendly and publicly accessible web-server for the predictor that is accessible to the public.In this study, we develop a high throughput computational model for the prediction of HSPs families and J-protein types. Three discrete protein sample representation methods namely: Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC), Dipeptide Composition and Split Amino Acid Composition (SAAC) were used to extract the numerical values from biological protein sequences of HSPs and J-proteins types. Various classification methods were utilized to select the high throughput algorithm for computational model. Cross validation test leave one out is used to evaluate the performance of proposed model.The remaining paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes materials and methods, Section 3 represents performance measures, Section 4 describes the results and discussion and conclusion has been drawn in the Section 5 of the paper.
