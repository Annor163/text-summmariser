@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we construct the probability sum (PS) function and the proportional distribution rules of membership function and non-membership function of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), and give their corresponding geometric interpretations. Based on which, we present the neutrality operation and the scalar neutrality operation on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). We propose the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted neutral averaging (IFWNA) operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted neutral averaging (IFOWNA) operator. The properties of the IFWNA operator and the IFOWNA operator are investigated. The principal advantages of the proposed operators are that both the attitude of the decision makers and the interactions between different intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) are considered. Furthermore, approaches to multi-criteria decision making based on the proposed IFWNA and IFOWNA operator are given. Finally, an example is illustrated to show the feasibility and validity of the new approaches to the application of decision making.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since the introduction of fuzzy sets(FSs) by Zadeh [34], many attempts have been made to study related theories. Atanassov [1] generalized the concept of FSs and proposed the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), which is a powerful tool to deal with vagueness [15]. Since information aggregation is a pervasive activity in our daily life, many operators have been presented on this issue [3,17,31–33]. Among them, the weighted averaging (WA) operator [17], the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator [33], the weighted geometric averaging (WGA) operator [25] and the ordered weighted geometric averaging(OWGA) operator [33] are four of the most common operators for aggregating information. Moreover, on a basis of the addition operation by Atanassov [2] and the scalar multiplication operation by De and Biswas [15] for different intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Xu [26] generalized the WA operator and the OWA operator to intuitionistic fuzzy environment and presented some intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators, including the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) operator, the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (IFOWA) operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid averaging (IFHA) operator. And Xu [26] also applied these operators to multi-attribute decision making problems. Based on the multiplication operation [2] and the power operation [15] on intuitionistic fuzzy sets, Xu and Yager [27] generalized the WGA operator and the OWGA operator to intuitionistic fuzzy environment and proposed some intutionistic fuzzy geometric aggregation operators, including the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric averaging (IFWGA) operator, the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric averaging (IFOWGA) operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid geometric averaging (IFHGA) operator. After these pioneering works, more attentions have been paid to intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria decision making problems [4,5,16,21,22,24,29,30,36–40]. Dymova and Sevastjanov [16] proposed a method to deal with the intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems based on Dempster-Shefer theory of evidence, Xu [29] developed some approaches to multiple attribute group decision making based on intuitionistic fuzzy power aggregation operators. Xu and Xia [30] applied the induced generalized aggregation operators to financial decision making under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environments. Ye [34] used entropy weight to get criteria weights and rank alternatives according to the correlation coefficients between each alternative and the ideal alternative. Zhou and Chen [39] provided the uncertain generalized ordered weighted averaging (UGOWA) operator. Zhu and Xu [40] proposed hesitant fuzzy geometric Bonferroni means. Deschrijver et al. [7–14] discussed the intuitionistic fuzzy decision making by interval-valued fuzzy set theory.Motivated by the existing information aggregation operators [3,17,26,27,31–33], including the interaction theory [19,20], considering that the attitudes of the decision makers for membership degree and non-membership degree are neutral in some decision situations, we construct the probability sum (PS) function and the proportional distribution rules of membership function and non-membership function of different intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs), and give the corresponding explanations. Based on which, we present some new operational laws on IFNs, such as the neutrality operation and the scalar neutrality operation. Moreover, we propose the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted neutral averaging (IFWNA) operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted neutral averaging (IFOWNA) operator. Finally, we apply them to multi-criteria decision making and give an example to show the feasibility and validity of the new approaches.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some basic concepts. Section 3 develops some neutral operations on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs), including the neutrality operation and scalar neutrality operation. The geometric interpretations of the PS function are illustrated and the proportional distribution rules of membership function and non-membership function of IFNs are explained. In Section 4, we propose the IFWNA operator and the IFOWNA operator. The properties of them are investigated. In Section 5, we apply the proposed operators to multi-criteria decision making under intuitionistic fuzzy environment and a numerical example is illustrated to show the feasibility and validity of the new approaches. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.The concept of fuzzy sets (FSs) was introduced by Zadeh [35], which can be defined as follows.Definition 1[35]. Let X be an ordinary finite non-empty set. A fuzzy set F in X is defined asF=x,uFx∈X, where uFis the membership function of the fuzzy set F, UF:X→[0, 1],, uF(x) indicates the degree of membership of x in F. 0≤uF(x)≤1.Later, Atanassov [1] generalized the fuzzy sets and proposed the concept of IFSs, which have been used in many fields, such as pattern recognition, machine learning and decision making [35–40].Definition 2[1]. Let X be an ordinary finite non-empty set. An intuitionistic fuzzy set A in X is an expressionA=x,uA,vA,πAx∈XwhereuA,vA,πA:X→[0,1], satisfying the conditionuA+vA+πA=1for all x in X. The numbersuA(x),vA(x),πA(x)reflect the degree of membership, the degree of non-membership and the degree of hesitance of the element x in the set A, respectively.For convenience, intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are denoted asA=uA,vA[26,27]. We denote all the intuitionistic fuzzy numbers as IFNs(X).Atanassov [2] and De et al. [15] introduced some basic operations on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, which not only can ensure that the operational results are also intuitionistic fuzzy sets but also are useful in the calculus of linguistic variables under intuitionistic fuzzy environment [26].Definition 3[2,15]. LetA=uA,vAandB=uB,vBbe two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, thenChen and Tan [6] developed a score function S to evaluate the degree of suitability that an alternative satisfies a decision make's requirement based on the intuitionistic fuzzy sets.Definition 4[6,26]. LetA=uA,vAbe an intuitionistic fuzzy number. The score of A can be evaluated bySA=uA−vA, where −1≤S(A)≤1.Hong and Choi [18] developed an accuracy functionH(A)=uA+vAto evaluate the degree of accuracy of the intuitionistic fuzzy setA=〈uA,vA〉, where 0≤H(A)≤1. The larger the value of H(A), the higher the degree of accuracy of the degree of membership of the intuitionistic fuzzy set A[26].Based on score function and accuracy function, Xu [26,27] defined the comparison law for intuitionistic fuzzy numbers as follows.Definition 5[26,27]. LetA=uA,vAandB=uB,vBbe two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Then A<B if and only ifConsidering that different operations are needed to adapted to various decision environment, and the existing addition operation [2] on IFSs cannot be used in all situations. For example, let A and B be two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers,A=uA,0,B=uB,vBandvB≠0, then according to addition operation by Atanassov [2], we havevA⊕B=vA=0.Evidently,vBis not accounted for at all, which is an undesirable feature for an averaging operation.Thus, we introduce some new operations on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, including the neutrality operation and scalar neutrality operation, taking the attitude of the decision makers and the interactions between different IFNs into consideration.Definition 6LetA=uA,vAandB=uB,vBbe two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The neutrality operation of A and B is defined as(5)AΘB=MCS(A,B)MCS(A,B)+NCS(A,B)⋅PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB)),NCS(A,B)MCS(A,B)+NCS(A,B)⋅PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB)),,wherePS((uA+vA),(uB+vB))is called the probability sum (PS) of A and B, and(6)PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB))=1−(1−(uA+vA))1−(uB+vB).MCS(A, B) and NCS(A, B) are called the membership coefficient sum and the non-membership coefficient sum of A and B, respectively, andMCS(A,B)=uA+uB,NCS(A,B)=vA+vB.SupposePS(λ(uA+vA))=PS((uA+vA),PS((λ−1)(uA+vA)))for IFNA=〈uA,vA〉and λ>1, then we have the following Proposition 1.For any nonnegative real number λ, and IFNA=uA,vA, we havePS(λ⋅(uA+vA))=1−(1−(uA+vA))λ.(1) When λ=2, it is obviously holds.(2) If Proposition 1 holds for λ=n. Then, for λ=n+1, we have(7)PS((n+1)(uA+vA))=PS((uA+vA),PS(n(uA+vA)))=PS((uA+vA),(1−(1−(uA+vA))n))=1−(1−(uA+vA))(1−(1−(uA+vA))n))=1−(1−(uA+vA),)n+1.Thus, by using mathematic induction on n, Proposition 1 holds for n, which completes the proof.The scalar neutrality operation of A and B is defined as(8)λ⋅A=MCS(λ⋅A)MCS(λ⋅A)+NCS(λ⋅A)⋅PS(λ⋅(uA+vA)),NCS(λ⋅A)MCS(λ⋅A)+NCS(λ⋅A)⋅PS(λ⋅(uA+vA))where MCS(λ·A)=λ·uAandNCS(λ⋅A)=λ⋅vA.Proposition 2LetA=〈uA,vA〉andB=〈uB,vB〉be two different IFNs. IfuA=vAanduB=vB,thenuAΘB=vAΘB.By Eq. (5), we haveuAΘBvAΘB=MCS(A,B)NCS(A,B)=uA+uBvA+vB,IfuA=vAanduB=vB,thenuA+uBvA+vB=1.Thus,uAΘB=vAΘB,which completes the proof of Proposition 2.That is, the aggregation results of membership function and non-membership function by the new operational laws are the same under the condition that the membership degree and non-membership degree of different IFNs are the same.However, even ifuA=vAanduB=vB,according to the Eq. (1), we cannot get the result thatuA⊕B=vA⊕B,i.e.,uA⊕B≠vA⊕B.From the special case of Proposition 2, we can see that the decision maker has the neutral attitude to the membership degree and non-membership degree by Eqs. (5) and (8). Therefore, Eqs. (5) and (8) are called the neutrality operation and the scalar neutrality operation, respectively.LetA=〈uA,vA〉,B=〈uB,vB〉,A′=〈uA′,vA′〉,B′=〈uB′,vB′〉be four intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, andC=〈uC,vC〉=AΘB.The operational rule of the PS function can be explained geometrically as follows.uAand uBdenote the membership degree of A and B, respectively.vAandvBdenote the non-membership degree of A and B, respectively. From the probability point of view, we may as well regarduA+vAanduB+vBas two independent events, anduC+vCrepresents the probability sum of at least one event ofuA+vAanduB+vBoccurring in a universe of discourse, thus(9)uC+vC=PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB)).In fact, the PS operator is the well-known t-cornorms [7,23]. Thus,PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB))is commutative, associative and an increasing mapping. Moreover, they are bounded under intuitionistic fuzzy environment, and have a zero element as the following Proposition 3.Proposition 3LetA=〈uA,vA〉,B=〈uB,vB〉,A′=〈uA′,vA′〉,B′=〈uB′,vB′〉be four intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, then(1)Boundedness:PS(0,0)=0,PS(1,1)=1,0≤PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB))≤1.Monotonicity:(uA+vA)≤(uA′+vA′)and(uB+vB)≤(uB′+vB′), thenPS((uA+vA),(uB+vB))≤PS((uA′+vA′),(uB′+vB′)).Commutativity:PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB))=PS((uB+vB),(uA+vA)).Associability:PS((uA′+vA′),(PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB))))=PS((PS(uA′+vA′,(uA+vA))),(uB+vB)).Zero element:PS(0,(uA+vA))=PS((uA+vA),0)=uA+vA.For further research concerning t-conorms on intuitionistic fuzzy pairs〈u,v〉,please refer to [7,9–12,23].For a multi-attribute decision making, suppose the characteristics of the alternative x under attributes Gj(j=1, 2, …, m) are represented by intuitionistic fuzzy setsAj=〈uAj,vAj〉(j=1,2,…,m).We may as well denote the membership coefficient sum ofAj=〈uAj,vAj〉(j=1,2,…,m)in the aggregation process as MCS(A1, A2, …, Am). That is,MCS(Aj)=uAj(j=1,2,…,m),and(10)MCS(A1,A2,…,Am)=MCS(A1,A2,…,Am−1)+MCS(Am).Thus,MCS(A1,A2,…,Am)=∑j=1muAj.Similarly, the non-membership coefficient sum ofAj=〈uAj,vAj〉(j=1,2,…,m)in the aggregation process is denoted by NCS(A1, A2, …, Am). That is,NCS(Aj)=uAj(j=1,2,…,m),and(11)NCS(A1,A2,…,Am)=NCS(A1,A2,…,Am−1)+NCS(Am).i.e.,NCS(A1,A2,…,Am)=∑j=1mvAj.From Eq. (10), we can see that the membership coefficient sum of A1, A2 isuA1+uA2,notuA1+uA2uA1+vA1+uA2+vA2(1−(1−(uA1+vA1))⋅(1−(uA1+vA1))).Especially, ifA1=A2=A=〈uA,vA〉,thenMCS(2A)=MCS(A,A)=uA+uA=2⋅uA=2⋅MCS(A).Then similar to the proof technique in Proposition 1, we have(12)MCS(λ⋅A)=λ⋅MCS(A).and(13)NCS(λ⋅A)=λ⋅NCS(A).Proposition 4LetA=〈uA,vA〉,B=〈uB,vB〉be two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, for λ, λ1, λ2>0, it has(14)(1)MCS(A,B)=MCS(B,A),MCS(λ(A,B))=MCS(λA,λB),MCS(λ1A,λ2A)=MCS((λ1+λ2)A).(15)(2)NCS(A,B)=NCS(B,A),NCS(λ(A,B))=NCS(λA,λB),NCS(λ1A,λ2A)=NCS((λ1+λ2)A).By Eq. (10), we have MCS(A, B)=MCS(B, A), by Eq. (12), it has MCS(λ(A, B))=MCS(λA, λB), by Eqs. (10) and (12), we have Eq. (14).Similarly, by Eqs. (11) and (13), we can easily prove Eq. (15).It should be noted that Fig. 1and Eqs. (6)–(15) explain the origin of the neutrality operation in Definition 6 under multi-attribute decision making environment.Furthermore, Eq. (5) in Definition 6 can be presented as(16)AΘB=uA+uBuA+vA+uB+vB(1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB))),vA+vBuA+vA+uB+vB(1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB))).In the following, we explain the origin of scalar neutrality operation in Definition 6 under multi-attribute decision making environment.According to Eq. (5), we have2A=AΘA=MCS(A,A)MCS(A,A)+NCS(A,A)⋅PS((uA+vA)(uA+vA)),NCS(A,A)MCS(A,A)+NCS(A,A)⋅PS((uA+vA)(uA+vA))By Eqs. (12) and (13), we haveMCS(A,A)=2⋅uA,NCS(A,A)=2⋅vA.Thus,(17)2A=2⋅uA2⋅uA+2⋅vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))2),2⋅vA2⋅uA+2⋅vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))2)=uAuA+vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))2),vAuA+vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))2).By Eqs. (5) and (17), we have3A=2AΘA=MCS(2A,A)MCS(2A,A)+NCS(2A,A)⋅PS((1−(1−(uA+vA))2),(uA+vA)),NCS(2A,A)MCS(2A,A)+NCS(2A,A)⋅PS((1−(1−(uA+vA))2),(uA+vA))NCS(2A,A)MCS(2A,A)+NCS(2A,A)⋅PS1−1−uA+vA2,uA+vA.By Eqs. (12) and (13), we haveMCS(2A,A)=MCS(2A)+MCS(A)=2⋅uA+uA=3⋅uANCS(2A,A)=NCS(2A)+NCS(A)=2⋅vA+vA=3⋅vA.Thus,(18)3A=3⋅uA3⋅uA+3⋅vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))3),3⋅vA3⋅uA+3⋅vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))3)=uAuA+vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))3),vAuA+vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))3).By analogy, for any positive integer n, we have(19)nA=uAuA+vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))n),vAuA+vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))n).We extend positive integer n to any nonnegative real number λ, and have(20)λA=uAuA+vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ),vAuA+vA(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ).It should be noted that Fig. 1 and Eqs. (7)–(20) explain the origin of the scalar neutrality operation in Definition 6 under multi-attribute decision making environment. Thus we suppose Eq. (6) in Definition 6 can be represented as Eq. (20) and this can be proved by the mathematical induction similar to the method in Proposition 1.In this subsection, we investigate some properties of the neutrality operation and the scalar neutrality operation under multi-attribute decision making environment.Actually, the operational results of the neutral operational laws mentioned above on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are also intuitionistic fuzzy numbers.Theorem 1IfA=K〈uA,vA〉∈IFNs(X)andB=〈uB,vB〉∈IFNs(X),C=〈uC,vC〉is the neutrality operation of A and B,D=〈uD,vD〉is the scalar neutrality operation of λ and A, and λ>0. Then C, D∈IFNs(X).From Definition 6 and Eq. (16), we know thatuC=uA+uBuA+vA+uB+vB(1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB))),vC=vA+vBuA+vA+uB+vB(1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB))),uC+vC=(1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB))).SinceA=〈uA,vA〉∈IFNs(X)andB=〈uB,vB〉∈IFNs(X),by Definition 2, we have0≤uA,vA,uB,vB≤1and0≤uA+vA≤1,0≤uB+vB≤1.Thus,0≤uA+uBuA+vA+uB+vB≤1(uA+vA+uB+vB≠0)and0≤(1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB)))≤1.Therefore,0≤uC,vC,uC+vC≤1,i.e., C∈IFNs(X).Similarly, we have D∈IFNs(X).LetA=〈uA,vA〉andB=〈uB,vB〉be two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, λ, λ1, λ2>0. Then we have(1)AΘB=BΘA;(2)λ(AΘB)=λAΘλB;(3)λ1AΘλ2A=(λ1+λ2)A.(1) By Eq. (5), we have (1) directly.(2) By Eq. (5), we haveAΘB=MCS(A,B)MCS(A,B)+NCS(A,B)⋅PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB)),NCS(A,B)MCS(A,B)+NCS(A,B)⋅PS((uA+vA),(uB+vB)).By Eq. (6), we havePS((uA+vA),(uB+vB))=1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB)).By Eq. (8), we haveλAΘB=MCS(λ(A,B))MCS(λ(A,B))+NCS(λ(A,B))⋅PS(λ⋅(1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB)))),NCS(λ(A,B))MCS(λ(A,B))+NCS(λ(A,B))⋅PS(λ⋅(1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB))))By Eq. (7), we havePS(λ⋅(1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB))))=1−(1−(uA+vA))⋅(1−(uB+vB))λ=1−(1−(uA+vA))λ⋅(1−(uB+vB))λ.By Eqs. (10) and (12), we have MCS(λ(A, B))=λ(uA+uB).Similarly,NCS(λ(A,B))=λ(vA+vB).Thus,λAΘB=λ(uA+uB)λ(uA+uB)+λ(vA+vB)⋅(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ⋅(1−(uB+vB))λ),λ(vA+vB)λ(uA+uB)+λ(vA+vB)⋅(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ⋅(1−(uB+vB))λ)By Eq. (8), we haveλ⋅A=MCS(λ⋅A)MCS(λ⋅A)+NCS(λ⋅A)⋅PS(λ⋅(uA+vA)),NCS(λ⋅A)MCS(λ⋅A)+NCS(λ⋅A)⋅PS(λ⋅(uA+vA))andλ⋅B=MCS(λ⋅B)MCS(λ⋅B)+NCS(λ⋅B)⋅PS(λ⋅(uB+vB)),NCS(λ⋅B)MCS(λ⋅B)+NCS(λ⋅B)⋅PS(λ⋅(uB+vB)).Then by Eq. (5), we haveλAΘλB=MCS(λA,λB)MCS(λA,λB)+NCS(λA,λB)⋅PS((1−(1−uA+vA)λ),(1−(1−(uB+vB))λ)),NCS(λA,λB)MCS(λA,λB)+NCS(λA,λB)⋅PS((1−(1−uA+vA)λ),(1−(1−(uB+vB))λ)).By Eq. (7), we havePS((1−(1−uA+vA)λ),(1−(1−(uB+vB))λ))=1−(1−(uA+vA))λ⋅(1−(uB+vB))λ.By Eqs. (10) and (12), we have MCS(λA, λB)=λ(uA+uB).Similarly,NCS(λA,λB)=λ(vA+vB).Thus,λAΘλB=λ(uA+uB)λ(uA+uB)+λ(vA+vB)⋅(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ⋅(1−(uB+vB))λ),λ(vA+vB)λ(uA+uB)+λ(vA+vB)⋅(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ⋅(1−(uB+vB))λ).Therefore, λ(AΘB)=λAΘλB.(3) By Eq. (8), we haveλ1⋅A=MCS(λ1⋅A)MCS(λ1⋅A)+NCS(λ1⋅A)⋅PS(λ1⋅(uA+vA)),NCS(λ1⋅A)MCS(λ1⋅A)+NCS(λ1⋅A)⋅PS(λ1⋅(uA+vA)),λ2⋅A=MCS(λ2⋅A)MCS(λ2⋅A)+NCS(λ2⋅A)⋅PS(λ2⋅(uA+vA)),NCS(λ2⋅A)MCS(λ2⋅A)+NCS(λ2⋅A)⋅PS(λ2⋅(uA+vA)).By Eq. (7), we havePS(λ1⋅(uA+vA))=1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1,PS(λ2⋅(uA+vA))=1−(1−(uA+vA))λ2.Then by Eq. (5), we haveλ1AΘλ2A=MCS(λ1A,λ2A)MCS(λ1A,λ2A)+NCS(λ1A,λ2A)⋅PS((1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1),(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ2)),NCS(λ1A,λ2A)MCS(λ1A,λ2A)+NCS(λ1A,λ2A)⋅PSPS((1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1),(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ2))By Eq. (7), we havePS(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1),(1−(1−(uA+vA))λ2)=1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1⋅(1−(uA+vA))λ2=1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1+λ2.By Eqs. (10) and (12), we haveMCS(λ1A,λ2A)=λ1+λ2uA.Similarly,NCS(λ1A,λ2A)=(λ1+λ2)vA.Thus,λ1AΘλ2A=(λ1+λ2)uA(λ1+λ2)uA+(λ1+λ2)vA⋅1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1+λ2,(λ1+λ2)vA(λ1+λ2)uA+(λ1+λ2)vA⋅1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1+λ2.By Eq. (8), we haveλ1+λ2A=MCS((λ1+λ2)A)MCS((λ1+λ2)A)+NCS((λ1+λ2)A)⋅PS((λ1+λ2)⋅(uA+vA)),NCS((λ1+λ2)A)MCS((λ1+λ2)A)+NCS((λ1+λ2)A)⋅PS((λ1+λ2)⋅(uA+vA)).By Eq. (7), we havePS((λ1+λ2)⋅(uA+vA))=1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1+λ2.By Eqs. (10) and (12), we have MCS((λ1+λ2)A)=(λ1+λ2)uA.Similarly,NCS((λ1+λ2)A)=(λ1+λ2)vA.Thus,λ1+λ2A=(λ1+λ2)uA(λ1+λ2)uA+(λ1+λ2)vA⋅1−(1−uA+vA)λ1+λ2,(λ1+λ2)vA(λ1+λ2)uA+(λ1+λ2)vA⋅1−(1−(uA+vA))λ1+λ2.Therefore, λ1AΘλ2A=(λ1+λ2)A.The WA operator [17] and the OWA operator [33] are two of the most common operators for aggregating information. Xu [26] generalized the WA operator and the OWA operator to intuitionistic fuzzy environment and proposed some intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operators. Motivated by Yager [33] and Xu [26], we define the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted neutral averaging (IFWNA) operator as follows.Definition 7LetAi=〈uAi,vAi〉(i=1,⋯,n)be a collection of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The IFWNA operator with respect to a weighting vector w is defined as(21)IFWNAw(A1,…,An)=Θi=1nwiAi,wherew=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tis the weighting vector of Aiwithwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1.LetAi=〈uAi,vAi〉(i=1,⋯,n)be a collection of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, then their aggregated value by using the IFWNA operator is also an intuitionistic fuzzy number, i.e.,IFWNAw(A1,…,An)∈IFNs(X).Furthermore,(22)IFWNAw(A1,⋯,An)=∑i=1n(wi⋅uAi)∑i=1nwi(uAi+vAi)1−∏i=1n(1−(uAi+vAi))wi∑i=1n(wi⋅vAi)∑i=1nwi(uAi+vAi)1−∏i=1n(1−(uAi+vAi))wi.We prove Eq. (22) by using mathematic induction on n.(1) When n=1,w1=1, we haveIFWNAw(A1)=w1A1=A1=〈uA1,vA1〉=w1⋅uA1w1(uA1+vA1)⋅(1−(1−(uA1+vA1))w1),w1⋅vA1w1(uA1+vA1)⋅(1−(1−(uA1+vA1))w1).Thus, Eq. (22) holds.(2) If Eq. (22) holds for n=k, that isIFWNAw(A1,…,Ak)=∑i=1k(wiuAi)∑i=1k(wi(uAi+vAi))1−∏i=1k(1−(uAi+vAi))wi,∑i=1kvAi∑i=1k(uAi+vAi)1−∏i=1k(1−(uAi+vAi))wi,.Moreover,MCS(IFWNAwA1,…,Ak)=MCS(w1A1,w2A2,…,wkAk)=∑i=1k(wiuAi)andNCS(IFWNAw(A1,…,Ak))=NCS(w1A1,w2A2,…,wkAk)=∑i=1k(wivAi).Then, n=k+1, we haveIFWNAw(A1,A2,…Ak+1)=Θi=1k+1wiAi=(IFWNAw(A1,A2,…Ak+1))Θwk+1Ak+1.By Eq.

(6), we havePS((1−∏i=1k(1−(uAi+vAi))wi),1−(1−(uAk+1+vAk+1))wk+1)=1−∏i=1k+1(1−(uAi+vAi))wi.By Eqs. (10) and (12), we haveMCS((IFWNAw(A1,…Ak)),(wk+1Ak+1))=∑i=1k(wiuAi)+wk+1uAk+1=∑i=1k+1(wiuAi)Similarly,NCS((IFWNAw(A1,…Ak)),(wk+1Ak+1))=∑i=1k(wivAi)+wk+1vAk+1=∑i=1k+1(wivAi).Thus,IFWNAw(A1,A2,…Ak+1)=(IFWNAw(A1,A2,…Ak))Θ(wk+1Ak+1)=∑i=1k+1(wi⋅uAi)∑i=1k+1wi(uAi+vAi)1−∏i=1k+1(1−(uAi+vAi))wi,∑i=1k+1(wi⋅vAi)∑i=1k+1wi(uAi+vAi)1−∏i=1k+1(1−(uAi+vAi))wi.i.e., equation (22) holds for n=k+1.Therefore, by using mathematic induction on n, equation (22) holds for n.A=〈uA,vA〉∈IFNs(X)andB=〈uB,vB〉∈IFNs(X).LetAi=〈uAi,vAi〉andBi=〈uBi,vBi〉(i=1,⋯,n)be two sets of IFNs andw=(w1,⋯,wn)is the associated weighting vector, satisfyingwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1.1)Idempotency: IfAi=A0=〈uA0,vA0〉,for all i, thenIFWNAw(A1,⋯,An)=A0.Boundedness:mini{uAi+vAi}≤uIFWNAw(A1,⋯,An)+vIFWNAw(A1,⋯,An)≤maxi{uAi+vAi},andmini{uAi+vAi}⋅mini{uAi}maxi{uAi+vAi}≤uIFWNAw(A1,⋯,An)≤minimaxi{uAi+vAi}⋅maxi{uAi}mini{uAi+vAi},1mini{uAi+vAi}⋅mini{vAi}maxi{uAi+vAi}≤vIFWNAw(A1,⋯,An)≤minimaxi{uAi+vAi}⋅maxi{vAi}mini{uAi+vAi},1.Monotonicity: IfuAi+vAi≤uBi+vBifor all i, thenuIFWNAw(A1,…,An)+vIFWNAw(A1,…,An)≤uIFWNAw(B1,…,Bn)+vIFWNAw(B1,…,Bn).Moreover, ifuAi+vAi=uBi+vBianduAi≤uBi,thenIFWNAw(A1,…,An)≤IFWNAw(B1,…,Bn),anduIFWNAw(A1,…,An)≤uIFWNAw(B1…,Bn),vIFWNAw(A1,…,An)≥vIFWNAw(B1,…,Bn).(1) By Theorem 3, we can prove (1) directly.(2)mini{uAi+vAi}=1−(1−mini{uAi+vAi})∑i=1nwi=1−∏i=1n(1−mini{uAi+vAi})wi≤1−∏i=1n(1−(uAi+vAi))wi≤1−∏i=1n(1−maxi{uAi+vAi})wi=1−{1−maxi{uAi+vAi}}∑i=1nwi=maxi{uAi+vAi}According to Eq. (22), we haveuIFWNAw(A1,…,An)+vIFWNAw(A1,…,An)=1−∏i=1n(1−(uAi+vAi))wi.Therefore,mini{uAi+vAi}≤uIFWNAw(A1,…,An)+vIFWNAw(A1,…,An)≤maxi{uAi+vAi}.Moreover,mini{uAi+vAi}⋅mini{uAi}maxiuAi+vAi=∑i=1n(wi⋅(mini{uAi}))∑i=1nwi⋅maxiuAi+vAi⋅1−(1−mini{uAi+vAi})∑i=1nwi=∑i=1n(wi⋅(mini{uAi}))∑i=1n(wi⋅(maxi{uAi+vAi}))⋅1−∏i=1n(1−mini{uAi+vAi})wi≤∑i=1n(wi⋅uAi)∑i=1n(wi⋅(uAi+vAi))1−∏i=1n(1−(uAi+vAi))wi=uIFWNAw(A1,…,An)≤∑i=1n(wi⋅(maxi{uAi}))∑i=1n(wi⋅(mini{uAi+vAi}))⋅1−∏i=1n(1−maxi{uAi+vAi})wi=∑i=1nwi⋅(maxi{uAi})∑i=1nwi⋅(mini{uAi+vAi})⋅1−(1−maxi{uAi+vAi})∑i=1nwi=maxi{uAi+vAi}⋅maxi{uAi}mini{uAi+vAi}.By Definition 2 and Theorem 3, we haveuIFWNAw(A1,…,An)≤1.Thus,mini{uAi+vAi}⋅mini{uAi}maxi{uAi+vAi}≤uIFWNAw(A1,⋯,An)≤minimaxi{uAi+vAi}⋅maxi{uAi}mini{uAi+vAi},1.Similarly, we havemini{uAi+vAi}⋅mini{vAi}maxi{uAi+vAi}≤vIFWNAw(A1,⋯,An)≤minimaxi{uAi+vAi}⋅maxi{vAi}mini{uAi+vAi},1.(3) IfuAi+vAi≤uBi+vBi,we haveuIFWNAw(A1,…,An)+vIFWNAw(A1,…,An)=1−∏i=1n(1−(uAi+vAi))wi≤1−∏i=1n(1−(uBi+vBi))wi=uIFWNAw(B1…,Bn)+vIFWNAw(B1,…,Bn)WhenuAi+vAi=uBi+vBianduAi≤uBi,we have1−∏i=1n(1−(uAi+vAi))wi=1−∏i=1n(1−(uBi+vBi))wi,∑i=1n(wiuAi)∑i=1n(wi(uAi+vAi))≤∑i=1n(wiuBi)∑i=1n(wi(uBi+vBi))and∑i=1n(wivAi)∑i=1n(wi(uAi+vAi))≥∑i=1n(wivBi)∑i=1n(wi(uBi+vBi)).Thus,uIFWNAw(A1…,An)≤uIFWNAw(B1,…,Bn),vIFWNAw(A1,…,An)≥vIFWNAw(B1…,Bn).Therefore,uIFWNAw(A1…,An)−vIFWNAw(A1…,An)≤uIFWNAw(B1…,Bn)−vIFWNAw(B1…,Bn).According to Definition 5, we haveIFWNAw(A1…,An)≤IFWNAw(B1,…,Bn).LetAi=〈uAi,vAi〉(i=1,…,n)be a collection of IFNs andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)is the associated weighting vector, satisfyingwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1.In some special cases, the IFWNA operator is reduced to the IFWA operator.Ifw=(1,0,…,0), thenIFWNAw(A1,A2…An)=IFWAw(A1,A2…An);Ifw=(0,0,…,1), thenIFWNAw(A1,A2…An)=IFWAw(A1,A2…An);Ifwi=1,wj=0,and j≠i, then we haveIFWNAw(A1…An)=IFWAw(A1,…An).Inspired by the OWA operator [33] and the IFOWA operator [26], we present intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted neutral averaging (IFOWNA) operator as follows.Definition 8LetAi=〈uAi,vAi〉(i=1,⋯,n)be a collection of IFNs. The IFOWNA operator with respect to a weighting vector w (IFOWNAw) is defined as(23)IFOWNAw(A1,…,An)=Θi=1nwiAσ(i),where Aσ(i) is the ith largest value of Ai(i=1, …, n).w=(w1,w2,…,wn)is the weighting vector of the IFOWNA operator, satisfyingwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1.LetAi=〈uAi,vAi〉(i=1,⋯,n)be a collection of IFNs, then their aggregated value by using the IFOWNA operator is also an IFN. Furthermore,(24)IFOWNAw(A1,⋯,An)=∑i=1n(wiuAσ(i))∑i=1n(wi(uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)))1−(1−(uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)))n,∑i=1n(wivAσ(i))∑i=1n(wi(uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)))(1−(1−(uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)))n)..Similar to Theorem 3, so it is omitted here.LetAi=〈uAi,vAi〉andBi=〈uBi,vBi〉(i=1,2,…,n)be two collections of IFNs andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)is the weighting vector of the IFOWNA operator, satisfyingwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1.1)Idempotency: IfAi=A0=〈uA0,vA0〉for all i, thenIFOWNAw(A1,…,An)=A0.Boundedness:mini{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)}≤uIFOWNAw(A1,…,An)+vIFOWNAw(A1,…,An)≤maxi{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)}.Andmini{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)}⋅mini{uAσ(i)}maxi{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)}≤uIFOWNAw(A1,⋯,An)minimaxi{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)}⋅maxi{uAσ(i)}mini{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)},1,mini{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)}⋅mini{vAσ(i)}maxi{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)}≤vIFOWNAw(A1,…,An)minimaxi{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)}⋅maxi{vAσ(i)}mini{uAσ(i)+vAσ(i)},1.Monotonicity: IfuAi≤uBi,vAi≥vBianduAi+vAi≤uBi+vBifor all i, thenmini{uAi+vAi}≤uIFOWNAw(A1,…,An)+vIFOWNAw(A1,…,An)≤maxi{uAi+vAi}.Moreover, ifuAi+vAi=uBi+vBianduAi≤uBi, thenIFOWNAw(A1,…,An)≤IFOWNAw(B1,…,Bn),anduIFOWNAw(A1,…,An)≤uIFOWNAw(B1,…,Bn),vIFOWNAw(A1,…,An)≥vIFOWNAw(B1,…,Bn).Commutativity: IfA′i=〈uA′i,vA′i〉(i=1,…n)is any permutation of Ai(i=1, ⋯n), thenIFOWNAw(A1,⋯,An)=IFOWNAw(A′1,⋯,A′n).The proofs of the first three properties of the IFOWNA operator are similar to that of the IFWNA operator, so it is omitted here. We can demonstrate the fourth property easily by Theorem 5 directly.LetAi=〈uAi,vAi〉(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of IFNs andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)is the weighting vector of the IFOWNA operator or the IFOWA operator, satisfyingwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1.In some special cases, the IFOWNA operator is reduced to the IFOWA operator.Note 4: Ifw=(1,0,…,0), thenIFOWNAw(A1,A2…An)=IFOWAw(A1,A2…An).Note 5: Ifw=(0,0,…,1), thenIFOWNAw(A1,A2…An)=IFOWAw(A1,A2…An).Note 6: Ifwi=1,wj=0(j≠i), then we haveIFOWNAw(A1,…An)=IFOWAw(A1,…An).For a multiple attributes decision making problem, let X={x1, x2, …, xn} be a set of alternatives, and G={G1, G2, …, Gm} be a set of attributes with the associated weighting vectorw=(w1,w2,…,wn), satisfyingwi∈[0,1]and∑i=1nwi=1.Assume that the characteristics of the alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, n) are represented by intuitionistic fuzzy numbersAij=〈uAij,vAij〉(i=1,2,…,n;j=1,2,…,m), whereuAijindicates the degree that the alternative xi(i=1, 2, …, n) satisfies the attributes Gj(j=1, 2, …, m),vAijindicates the degree that the alternative xi(i=1, 2, …, n) does not satisfy the attributes Gj(j=1, 2, …, m). Then we have the following decision making methods according to the weighting vectors of attributes are known or not.Step 1:Case 1If the weighting vectors of attributes are known or the calculation methods are determined. Then by Eq. (22), we aggregate the intuitionistic fuzzy information of candidate alternative xi(i=1, 2, …, n) under attributes Gj(j=1, 2, …, m) into collective onesAi=〈uAi,vAi〉(i=1,2,…,n)by using the normal distribution based method to determine the IFWNA weights [28].If the weighting vectors of attributes are unknown and the importance of the ordered positions of the arguments are considered. Then by Eq. (24), we aggregate the intuitionistic fuzzy information of candidate alternatives into collective ones.Step 2: Compare the final results Ai(i=1, 2, …, n) by Definition 5.Step 3: Rank all the alternatives xi(i=1, 2, …, n) according to the ranking of Ai(i=1, 2, …, n) in Step 2.Step 4: Select the best ones.ExampleSuppose that an investment company wants to investment a sum of money in a company. After analyzing the market, three possible alternatives are to be considered.•x1 is a car company.x2 is a food company.x3 a computer company.In order to assess these alternatives, the investors have brought a panel. After careful review of the information, they summarize the ability of companies with five attributes G={G1, G2, G3, G4, G5}.•G1: The risk analysis.G2: The growth analysis.G3: The social-political impact analysis.G4: The environmental impact analysis.G5: The development of the society.The three possible alternatives are to be evaluated by the intuitionistic fuzzy information (Table 1) under above five attributes.If the weighting vectors of attributes are determined by the normal distribution based method [28], i.e.,w=(0.112,0.236,0.304,0.236,0.112), we have the following method.Method 1Step 1: By Eq. (22), we haveA1=IFWNAw(A11,…,A15)=∑j=15(wjuA1j)∑j=15(wj(uA1j+vA1j))1−∏j=15(1−(uA1j+vA1j))wj,∑j=15(wjvA1j)∑j=15(wj(uA1j+vA1j))1−∏j=15(1−(uA1j+vA1j))wj=〈0.4411,0.3238〉,Similarly,A2=0.4589,0.3551, A3=〈0.4083, 0.4267〉.Step 2: By Definition 4, we have S(A1)=0.4411−0.3238=0.1173, S(A2)=0.1039, S(A3)=−0.0184. Then by Definition 5, we have A1>A2>A3.Step 3: By the ranking of Ai(i=1, 2, 3) in step 2, we have x1≻x2≻x3.Step 4: Obviously, x1 is the best alternative.If the weighting vectors of attributes are unknown and the importance of the ordered positions of the arguments are denoted by the weighting vectorw=(0.25,0.15,0.10,0.15,0.35),we have the following method.Method 2Step 1: By Definition 4, we have S(A31)=−0.5, S(A32)=0.2, S(A33)=−0.1, S(A34)=−0.1, S(A35)=0.4. And H(A33)=0.9, H(A34)=0.7. Then by Definition 5, we have A35>A32>A33>A34>A31. Thus, Aσ(1)=A35, Aσ(2)=A32, Aσ(3)=A33, Aσ(4)=A34, Aσ(5)=A31.By Eq. (24), we haveA3=IFOWNAw(A31,…,A35)=〈0.3866,0.4578〉.Similarly, A1=〈0.4113, 0.3239〉, A2=〈0.4211, 0.4159〉.Step 2: By Definition 4, we have S(A1)=0.0874, S(A2)=0.0051, S(A3)=−0.0712. Then by Definition 5, we have A1>A2>A3.Steps 3–4: By the ranking of Ai(i=1, 2, 3) in step 2, we have x1≻x2≻x3 and x1 is the best alternative.Obviously, the final results by the above two methods are the same. Moreover, if we use the methods proposed in [26,27], x1 are both the best alternative. Therefore, the method proposed by this paper is effective and validity.Concerning the sensitive of proposed methods to the input arguments, by replacing the IFNs in Table 1 with some other IFNs, and selecting the situations that the replaced IFNs are A11 and A35 as representative, we make a comparison between the results by methods in this paper and the results by methods in [26] and [27] as the following Tables.From Table 2, it obtained that when we replace the IFN A11 in Table 1 with <0.1,0.8> or <0.2,0.7>, and A35 with <0.3,0.5> or <0.6,0.1>, the final rankings of the alternatives by the different operator, such as the IFWA operator [26], the IFWGA operator [27] and the IFWNA operator in this paper, are the same. But when the replaced IFNs include zero membership degree or non-membership degree, the final rankings are not consistent. For example, if the replaced IFN A35 in Table 1 is <0.6,0>, with the IFWA operator developed in [26], the final ranking is x3≻x1≻x2. While with the IFWGA operator [27] or the IFWNA operator in this paper, the final ranking is x1≻x2≻x3.It should be noted that we have S(A1j)≥S(A3j), j=1, …, 5 according to Definitions 4 and 5 in the case that A35 in Table 1 is replaced by 〈0.6, 0〉. Thus, it is more acceptable for us to get the result that x1≻x3, which means the final ranking got by the IFWNA operator in this paper is more acceptable compared with the final ranking got by the IFWA operator [26].Similarly, we have that the final ranking got by the IFWNA operator in this paper is more acceptable compared with the final ranking got by the IFWGA operator [27] in the case that A11 in Table 1 is replaced by <0,0.5>.Therefore, the proposed IFWNA operator in this paper can be seen a good complement to the IFWA operator [26] or the IFWGA operator [27] in the cases that the considered IFNs include zero membership degree or non-membership degree.Similar to the analysis of the Table 2, From the Table 3, we can conclude that the final rankings of the alternatives by the IFOWA operator [26], the IFWOGA operator [27] and the IFOWNA operator in this paper are the same when we replace the IFN A11 in Table 1 with <0.1,0.8> or <0.05,0.8>, and A35 with <0.3,0.5> or <0.6,0.1>. Moreover, when the replaced IFNs include zero membership degree or non-membership degree, the final rankings got by the IFOWNA operator in this paper is more acceptable compared with the final ranking got by the IFWGA operator [26] or the IFWGA operator [27]. Therefore, the proposed IFOWNA operator in this paper can be seen a good complement to the IFOWA operator [26] and the IFOWGA operator [27] in the cases that the considered IFNs include zero membership degree or non-membership degree.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
On a basis of the probability sum (PS) function and the proportional distribution rules of membership function and non-membership function of IFSs, this paper presents some neutral operations on IFNs under multi-attribute decision making environment, including neutrality operation and scalar neutrality operation. The interpretations of the PS function and the proportional distribution rules of membership function and non-membership function of IFNs are given in detail. Moreover, this paper develops the IFWNA operator and the IFOWNA operator. The properties of these operators are investigated. The principal advantages of the proposed operators are that both the attitude of the decision makers and the interactions between different IFNs are considered. An approach to multi-criteria decision making based on the proposed operators is given under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Finally, an example shows the feasibility and validity of the new approach to the application of decision making.
