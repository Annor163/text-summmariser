PurposeTo determine the relationship between two CD24 polymorphisms, rs8734/rs52812045 and rs3838646, and autoimmune disease.DesignMeta-analysis.MethodsThe Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies reporting the association between CD24 polymorphisms and autoimmune disease. Two of the authors selected eligible studies and extracted and analyzed the data independently.ResultsCompared with carriers of the C allele (CC, CT, CT+CC), individuals homozygous for the T allele (TT) and heterozygous (CT+TT) at rs8734/rs52812045 have a higher incidence of autoimmune disease, whereas rs3838646 is not associated with autoimmune disease. Subgroup analysis found an increased risk of multiple sclerosis with the TT vs. CC, TT vs. CT, and TT vs. CC+CT alleles.ConclusionThe CD24 polymorphism rs8734/rs52812045 contributes to the development of autoimmune disease.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system produces antibodies against the body׳s own tissues [1,2]. Although many archetypes exist, autoimmune disease is classified into two major categories: tissue-specific and non-tissue-specific. Multiple sclerosis (MS), autoimmune thyroid diseases such as Grave׳s disease and Hashimoto׳s thyroiditis, and inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn׳s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are tissue specific, whereas systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), sarcoidosis, systemic sclerosis, and giant cell arteritis are non-tissue-specific autoimmune diseases [1].The pathogenesis and factors affecting the severity of autoimmune disease are elusive, but numerous reports have suggested their association with genetic and environmental factors [3–7]. Because the occurrence of MS, SLE, UC, and RA is linked with familial clustering and the frequency of monozygotic twins, the presence of genetic factors has drawn attention, and many studies have reported associations between autoimmune disease and genetic polymorphisms [6,8,9]. For example, relationships between the following autoimmune diseases and specific genes have been examined: autoimmune thyroid disease and interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-6, and IL-13; CD and the IL-23 receptor gene, NOD2, and PTPN2; UC and NOD2, human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), and PTPN2; MS and HLA-DRB1, HLA-DR2, the IL-2 receptor gene, and IL-1; and RA and IL-18, IRF5, and PTPN22[10–19].CD24, or heat-stable antigen, is a small, highly glycosylated glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein [20]. CD24 is expressed in most hematopoietic cells, including activated T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mature granulocytes, as well as non-hematopoietic cells such as astrocytes [21–26]. CD24 was first identified as a lymphoid differentiation marker, but its diverse functions are only now being revealed. For example, it promotes the differentiation and activation of B cells and the activation and clonal expansion of T cells [23,26,27]. It also functions as a checkpoint for T-cell homeostasis by protecting autoreactive T cells from clonal deletion and by maintaining T cells during their migration to the central nervous system [25,26]. When overexpressed in solid tumors, CD24 acts as an adhesion molecule in endothelial cells; promotes the proliferation, metastasis, and dissemination of tumor cells; and affects survival rates in cancer patients [20,21,28]. Furthermore, many in vivo studies have reported the association of CD24 with autoimmune disease. CD24 is required for the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in an animal model of MS, and thus, EAE induced by myelin-based, protein-pulsed dendritic cells is inhibited when CD24 is down-regulated [25,29,30]. In addition, CD24 is upregulated in CD, which increases the colony-forming capability and motility of cells, whereas the initial phase of experimental autoimmune thyroiditis is more severe in CD24-deficient mice [31,32].The human CD24 gene is located in the chromosome 6q21 region and comprises a 0.24-kb open reading frame and a 1.8-kb 3′ untranslated region [33,34]. This chromosome is associated with susceptibility to RA, MS, and SLE [3,6,8]. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD24 influence the occurrence and seriousness of autoimmune diseases, and all of the SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium [6,8,35,36]. The currently known SNPs in the CD24 gene are rs1058818, rs1058881, rs1136210, rs1136221, rs3840378, rs3810761, rs3838646, rs3950479, rs4030413, rs4030414, rs4030415, rs6530597, rs6530598, rs6530599, rs6530602, rs6530600, rs6530603, rs7892940, rs10465459, rs10482600, rs10482601, rs11545327, rs11545328, rs11545329, rs1136498, rs7892847, rs35795274, rs7892996, rs7893001, rs7893092, rs34905207, rs6530596, rs8734/rs52812045, rs58481495, rs7892847, rs7892864, rs1059138, and rs1136498 (all of which are found in the National Institutes of Health/National Center for Biotechnology Information SNP database: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/).Among these SNPs, rs8734/rs52812045 and rs3838646 in particular been studied for their association with the onset of autoimmune disease, but studies of polymorphisms in other regions are limited [31,35–38]. The change in an amino acid from alanine to valine in rs8734/rs52812045, which is a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchor cleavage site (ω-1 position) in CD24 exon 2, upregulates CD24 expression and increases the probability of autoimmune disease [36]. Dinucleotide deletion of TG at rs3838646 in the human CD24 3′ untranslated region destabilizes the messenger RNA and decreases CD24 expression, which reduces the risk of autoimmune disease [35]. However, the association of these polymorphisms with autoimmune predisposition is still under debate. Not all case-controlled studies have led to the same conclusions, and the lack of statistical power in most reports has precluded the generation of reliable results. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to obtain comprehensive results.We searched for relevant studies in the Medline (U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health), Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases using the following words: (“polymorphism” or “genetic polymorphism” or “polymorphism, genetic” or “single nucleotide polymorphism” or “SNP” or “mutation” or “variant”) and (“CD24 antigen” or “CD24” or “antigen, CD24” or “Ly52” or “heat stable antigen” or “ ba-1”). All studies published before November 15, 2014, were available, and there were no language restrictions. All studies reporting associations between CD24 polymorphisms and autoimmune disease risk were retrieved with the exception of several regional reports. In addition, the references cited in retrieved studies were scanned to avoid missing eligible studies.Studies included in the meta-analysis satisfied the following criteria: (1) the association between CD24 genetic polymorphisms and autoimmune disease was assessed, (2) the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) values or adequate data to infer these associations was presented, (3) genotyping and statistical methods were clearly described, and (4) the P values for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the control group were shown or could be calculated. Studies were excluded if they were (1) non-case-control studies, (2) based on partial data, (3) duplicates of previous reports, (4) unassociated with autoimmune disease, or (5) meta-analyses, letters, or reviews. The database search and study selection were performed by two of the authors (J.B. and H.B.) independently.The following data were extracted from each study: first author׳s name, publication year, country, subject ethnicity, disease studied, genotyping method, source of the controls, frequency of genotypes, sample size, and P value of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and minor allele frequency in the controls.All statistical tests were performed with Review Manager (version 5.2; The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Biostat, Englewood, USA) software. ORs with 95% CI were used to assess the strength of the association between the CD24 rs8734/rs52812045 and rs3838646 polymorphisms and autoimmune disease. Fixed- and random-effects models were used to calculate a pooled OR, and the statistical significance (P<0.05) of pooled ORs was determined with the Z-test. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated with Higgins׳ I2 statistic and the chi-squared-based Q-test. A P value of <0.10 for the Q-test indicated significant heterogeneity, and in this case, the random-effects model was used to calculate pooled ORs; otherwise, the fixed-effects model was used. Publication bias was assessed with either a funnel plot for visual inspection of asymmetry or Egger׳s linear regression test. Sensitivity analysis was performed by extracting a single study each time to check the stability of the result.The genetic models evaluated for pooled ORs of rs8734/rs52812045 were CT vs. CC, TT vs. CC, TT vs. TC, CT+TT vs. CC, TT vs. CC+CT, and T vs. C. The genetic models for rs3838646 were TGDel vs. TGTG, DelDel vs. TGTG, DelDel vs. TGDel, TGDel+DelDel vs. TGTG, DelDel vs. TGTG+TGDel, and Del vs. TG.
