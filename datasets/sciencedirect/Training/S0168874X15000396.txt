@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Ultrasonic guided waves are used in the non-destructive testing of pipelines. This involves launching an elastic wave along the wall of the pipe and then capturing the returning wave scattered by a defect. Numerical study of wave scattering is often computationally expensive because the shortest wavelength is often very small compared to the size of the pipe in the ultrasonic frequency range. Furthermore, the number of the scattered wave modes from a non-axisymmetric defect in the pipe can be large and separation of these modes is difficult in a conventional finite element method. Accordingly, this article presents a model suitable for studying elastic wave propagation in waveguides with an arbitrary cross-section in the time and frequency domain. A weighted residual formulation is used to deliver an efficient hybrid numerical formulation, which is applied to a long pipeline containing a defect of arbitrary shape. The problem is solved first in the frequency domain and then extended to the time domain using an inverse Fourier transform. To separate the scattered wave modes in the time domain, a technique is proposed whereby measurement locations are arranged axially along the pipe and a two dimensional Fourier transform is used to present data in the wavenumber−frequency domain. This enables the separation of highly dispersive modes and the recovery of modal amplitudes. This has the potential to reveal more information about the characteristics of a defect and so may help in distinguishing between different type of defects, such a cracks or regions of corrosion, typically found in pipelines.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Guided ultrasonic waves are used in the non-destructive testing of pipelines. The guided waves normally take the form of a pulse with a narrow frequency bandwidth, which is launched along the pipe wall and is then scattered when it hits a defect in the pipe, such as a crack or region of corrosion. Following scattering by the defect the returning wave is detected and interrogated and the aim of the method is to infer the presence of the defect and if possible the geometry of the defect. The scattering of guided ultrasonic waves from a general defect is a three-dimensional problem and so this presents a significant computational challenge that potentially requires a large number of degrees of freedom. Consequently computation time can quickly become prohibitive for relatively long pipe lengths. To overcome this problem, this article applies a hybrid numerical approach in order to deliver an efficient three dimensional methodology for the propagation of elastic waves in a pipe. It is demonstrated that this type of approach is sufficiently efficient to permit the generation of predictions for scattering from arbitrary defects located in long lengths of pipe in both the frequency and time domain.The development of three dimensional numerical models suitable for modelling large structures including pipelines continues to present a significant challenge. Current strategies include attempting to take advantage of symmetries present in a structure, or using finite element discretisations that are localised around a defect. For example, one may take advantage of symmetry in a pipeline and reduce the problem to two dimensions. Heidary and Ozevin recently accomplished this for an axisymmetric pipe under non-axisymmetric loading conditions [1], although this method cannot readily be applied to wave scattering problems from a general defect in a pipe because the loading function for a general defect remains unknown. Moreover, one must still mesh the entire pipe length which reduces the effectiveness of the method for long pipes. Alternatively, one can treat the pipe wall as a one dimensional structure and assume that the displacements and associated stresses and strains are constant over the pipe wall [2,3]. This will give a good approximation of the true behaviour for those modes in which the through thickness displacement profile is close to being constant, although this will be less successful for those modes for which this is not the case. Therefore, as the frequency of excitation is increased this approach is unlikely to capture accurately the behaviour of all modes propagating within a pipe.To overcome the limitations of two dimensional models one must return to a three dimensional approach that delivers a full numerical discretisation of the defect as well as the surrounding structure. For example, Casadei et al. [4] presented a multi-scale finite element approach to study localized defects in plates. A multi-scale approach delivers a significant reduction in elements placed well away from a defect and so improves the efficiency of the model. However, this method still demands that the entire structure is meshed and so for large structures such as plates recent efforts centre on discretising only the immediate vicinity surrounding a scattering object. For example, Velichko and Wilcox [5] use finite elements to discretise the region surrounding a scatterer and then asymptotic Green׳s functions to reconstruct the solution outside this region. This has the advantage of lowering the number of degrees of freedom required to analyse a relatively small scattering object located in a much larger structure; however, in order to suppress reflections from the boundaries in the outer region it is necessary to include an artificial absorbing region. Velichko and Wilcox demonstrate that this method can be applied to guided wave scattering from a circular hole in a plate, and this approach was later applied to irregular defects by Moreau et al. [6]. The addition of an absorbing layer, which is often called a perfectly matched layer, has also been widely applied by other authors and is popular in commercial finite element software. For example, Żak et al. proposed an absorbing layer with a particular damping profile to suppress reflections in a finite element model for elastic wave propagation in unbounded structures [7]. It is of course possible to apply this type of approach to the study of guided waves in pipelines; however, the absorbing boundary or perfectly matched layer demands extra degrees of freedom and this leads to computational inefficiencies. Moreover, the absorbing region does not fully absorb the outgoing waves and so some reflection is inevitable, especially in three dimensional applications where high order propagating modes are difficult to attenuate. Accordingly, where possible it is desirable to seek methods that avoid the use of absorbing layers.In the study of guided waves it is common to encounter long uniform sections of waveguide surrounding a relatively small scattering object or defect. It is desirable to take advantage of regions of uniformity and this can be accomplished in an efficient way by using a normal mode expansion. For example, Cho and Rose [8,9], and Zhao and Rose [10] proposed a hybrid boundary element method for analysing the scattering of Lamb and shear horizontal waves in a plate. Here the elastodynamic boundary integral equation is mapped onto an analytical normal mode expansion for the uniform section of the plate and this enabled the study of mode conversion by arbitrary defects. This method demonstrates a more efficient approach to studying guided waves as it does not rely on adding artificial absorbing regions. However, the method relies on the use of analytic expression for the propagating eigenmodes and so it is desirable to look at ways of removing this restriction so one can study waveguides with irregular cross-sectional geometries, as well as those applications where obtaining analytic solutions is challenging. Accordingly, it is sensible to extend this type of approach to include a numerical solution of the governing eigenequation for the uniform section of the waveguide. To this end a hybrid normal mode/finite element methodology has long been used in the study of elastic waves, although its application to pipes is still relatively limited. For example, Datta and Shah [11] applied the method to the scattering of shear waves in a plate, and Baronian et al. [12] examined the more general case of scattering from an arbitrary defect, although this was limited to a two dimensional waveguide. For pipes, Zhuang et al. [13] applied a hybrid formulation in the study of scattering from cracks in welds, although their analysis was restricted to an axisymmetric problem in order to permit the use of a Rayleigh Ritz approach for solving the eigenproblem on either side of the defect. Bai et al. [14] extended the work of Zhuang et al. [13] to non-axisymmetric circumferential cracks by combining analytic solutions for the pipe eigenmodes and coupling these to a numerical discretisation for the crack, although this was limited to an infinitely thin crack and, like Cho and Rose [8,9], they relied upon analytic eigensolutions. However, by subdividing the scattering from the crack into a symmetric and antisymmetric problem, Bai et al. were able to show that one may generate reflection coefficients for a non-axisymmetric problem in a pipe.An alternative method for computing the eigenmodes in a uniform section of the pipe was proposed by Zhou et al. [15], who used the wave finite element (WFE) method to solve the governing eigenproblem. This numerical solution for the eigenmodes enabled Zhou et al. to link their model to a finite element discretisation of the defect in a computationally efficient way. Zhou et al. used a hybrid WFE and finite element scheme to study axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric defects in pipes and presented predictions for reflection coefficient in the frequency domain. The majority of the results presented by Zhou et al. are for a two dimensional formulation. Furthermore, it is known that some numerical issues are present with the WFE method [16,17] and so it appears appropriate to investigate alternative methods for three dimensional problems. One possible approach is to find the eigenmodes for a waveguide by directly solving the governing eigenequation. This method is often referred to in the elastodynamic literature as the semi analytic finite element (SAFE) method; however it has also been used in the acoustic waveguide literature where there is no such terminology [18,19]. A hybrid SAFE-FE method was recently applied to elastic wave propagation in a solid cylinder by Benmeddour et al. [20]. This method uses a full three dimensional discretisation of a small region surrounding the non-axisymmetric crack and then uses the two dimensional finite element mesh on the surface of this region to directly solve the governing eigeneqaution. Accordingly, this method removes the need for absorbing boundaries remote from the defect and/or separating three dimensional slices of the pipe for solving the eigenproblem. This makes the SAFE-FE hybrid method very efficient and so it has also been used, for example, to study axisymmetric defects in coated pipes [21,22]. The purpose of this article is the application of the SAFE-FE method to pipe in a way that permits the solution and separation of all propagating modes in the time domain.The hybrid methods developed so far tend to be limited to the frequency domain, at least when studying three dimensional problems. This article will demonstrate that it is possible to generate predictions in the time domain for an arbitrary non-axisymmetric defect in a waveguide of arbitrary cross-section. The work presented here adopts a hybrid finite element method similar to that proposed by Benmeddour et al. [20], although a different formulation is used here. Benmeddour et al. use the principle of virtual work and apply a variational formulation to derive the governing SAFE-FE equations, whereas in this article we will use the alternative weighted residual method (WRM). The WRM is in principle a more general approach than the variational method and so this method is presented here for elastic wave propagation in pipes. Galerkin׳s method is then used to solve the problem and this is of course equivalent to a variational approach, but it will be shown that by using the WRM method one may arrive at a final governing equation that avoids the multiplication of global matrices seen in the variational approach of Benmeddour et al. [20]. The avoidance of these additional global matrix multiplications is potentially advantageous when one is required to make many repetitive solutions of the problem, as will be the case when Fourier transforms are used here to generate time domain predictions. Accordingly, this article begins by presenting a hybrid SAFE-FE formulation in Section 2 using a weighted residual approach. The frequency domain methodology is presented first and time domain simulations are then obtained following an inverse Fourier transform of the frequency domain computations. In Section 3, predictions are benchmarked against measured and predicted values for reflection coefficients reported in the literature. The method is then used to study scattering from a relatively small non-axisymmetric defect in both the time and frequency domain. Herek−ωplots are used to separate the propagating eigenmodes and it is shown that these plots can be used to avoid problems with dispersion when attempting to recover information about the defect at high frequencies.A hybrid SAFE-FE method is presented here that is valid for a waveguide of arbitrary cross-section. The material properties of the waveguide are assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous in order to simplify the notation in the equations that follow; however this method may be used for material properties that vary over the pipe cross section, as well as within the region discretised by finite elements. The governing equation for wave propagation in an elastic medium is given by Navier׳s equation:(1)(λ+μ)∇(∇⋅u′)+μ∇2u′=ρ∂2u′∂t2,whereλandμare the Lamé constants,u′is the displacement vector,ρis density andtis time. A time dependence ofeiωtis assumed throughout this article, whereωis the radian frequency andi=−1. Navier׳s equation may be written as three scalar equations using a Cartesian co-ordinate system, which gives(2a)(λ+μ)(∂2ux׳∂x2+∂2uy׳∂x∂y+∂2uz׳∂x∂z)+μ(∂2ux׳∂x2+∂2ux׳∂y2+∂2ux׳∂z2)=ρ∂2ux׳∂t2,(2b)(λ+μ)(∂2ux׳∂x∂y+∂2uy׳∂y2+∂2uz׳∂y∂z)+μ(∂2uy׳∂x2+∂2uy׳∂y2+∂2uy׳∂z2)=ρ∂2uy׳∂t2,(2c)(λ+μ)(∂2ux׳∂x∂z+∂2uy׳∂y∂z+∂2uz׳∂z2)+μ(∂2uz׳∂x2+∂2uz׳∂y2+∂2uz׳∂z2)=ρ∂2uz׳∂t2,whereux׳,uy׳anduz׳are displacements in the x, y and z directions, respectively, see alsoFig. 1. On the surface of the pipe it is assumed that no external forces are present so that all the tractions over the surface are zero. The boundary conditions may then be written as(3)hq=σqlnl=0,where the indicesqandltake on values ofx,yandz, and the summation convention applies to repeated indices oflonly. In Eq. (3)σqldenotes the Cauchy stress tensor andnlis the unit outward normal vector to the surface of the pipe. The usual relationships between stresses and strains are(4a)hx=λ(∂ux׳∂x+∂uy׳∂y+∂uz׳∂z)nx+2μ∂ux׳∂xnx+μ(∂ux׳∂y+∂uy׳∂x)ny+μ(∂ux׳∂z+∂uz׳∂x)nz,(4b)hy=μ(∂uy׳∂x+∂ux׳∂y)nx+λ(∂ux׳∂x+∂uy׳∂y+∂uz׳∂z)ny+2μ∂uy׳∂yny+μ(∂uy׳∂z+∂uz׳∂y)nz,(4c)hz=μ(∂uz׳∂x+∂ux׳∂z)nx+μ(∂uz׳∂y+∂uy׳∂z)ny+λ(∂ux׳∂x+∂uy׳∂y+∂uz׳∂z)nz+2μ∂uz׳∂znz.The SAFE method is used to obtain the eigenvalues for the pipe and this method is now well rehearsed in the literature, see for example Refs. [23–26], and so this is only briefly reported here. The displacementsu1q׳in regionΩ1of the pipe (regionsΩ1andΩ3are assumed to be identical) are expanded over the pipe eigenmodes to give(5)u1q׳(x,y,z)=∑n=0∞u1qn(x,y)e−ikγnz,where the subscriptq=x,yorz, andu1q(x,y)are the eigenvectors in regionΩ1, withk=ω/cTso thatγis a dimensionless wavenumber. In addition,cTandcLare the shear (torsional) and compressional (longitudinal) bulk wave velocities, respectively. The finite element analysis proceeds by discretising the displacements of any modenover the pipe cross-section to give(6)u1q(x,y)=∑j=1p1qNqj(x,y)u1qj=Nqu1q,whereNqjis a global trial (or shape) function,u1qjis the value ofu1qat nodej, andp1qis the number of nodes (or degrees of freedom) for the displacements in directionq. In addition,Nqandu1qare row and column vectors of lengthp1q, respectively, and it is convenient to chooseNx=Ny=Nz=N. To formulate the governing eigenequation, Eq. (5) is substituted back into Eq. (2) and by using a weak formulation and introducing the boundary conditions in Eq. (3) one may arrive at the following general eigenequation:(7)Pu1=γSu1,whereu1=[u1xu1yu1zγu1xγu1yγu1z]T. The constituents of matricesPandSare given in Appendix A. Eq. (7) is a sparse symmetric eigenequation of order6p1, withp1=p1x=p1y=p1z. This equation is able to provide eigenvalue solutions for waveguides with an arbitrary cross-sectional area. However, the focus of this article is to study wave scattering problem in an axisymmetric pipe. Solution of this equation yields an unordered list of the eigenvaluesγand their associated eigenvectorsu1, where the eigenvalues appear in the pairsγand–γ, which indicates waves travelling in the positive and negativezdirections, respectively. It is necessary to sort these modes before further implementation of the hybrid method; however, one problem with a general application of the SAFE method is that it is often rather difficult to distinguish each family of modes when sorting the unordered list of eigenvalues. To overcome this the eigenvectors are first transformed from a Cartesian to a cylindrical coordinate system (r,θandz) through the relationshipsu1θ=−sinθu1x+cosθu1y,u1r=cosθu1x+sinθu1y, and withu1zremaining the same for both systems. This article focuses on pipes and so the modes are labelled according to the convention established by Silk and Bainton [27], which defines the torsionalT(0,n), longitudinalL(0,n)and flexuralF(m,n)modes, form>0. To sort these modes a Fourier transform is applied to those values ofu1θandu1zlying on the outer circumference of the pipe. Nowu1θandu1zmay be expressed in the circumferential direction as eithersinmθorcosmθ, so that the peak value in the Fourier transformed domain can only exist at mode ordermifu1θoru1zis not equal to zero. Thus, the circumferential ordermof each mode is found by locating the peak value of the Fourier transformed data foru1θoru1z, which permits the sorting of solutions to Eq. (7) into torsional, longitudinal and flexural modes. Each mode type is then sorted in ascending order based on the absolute value of the eigenvalue.A three dimensional finite element discretisation is used for the non-uniform section of the pipe,Ω2, which is assumed to contain a defect of arbitrary shape, see Fig. 1. The displacementsu2q׳(x,y,z)inΩ2are discretised to give:(8)u2q׳(x,y,z)=∑j=1p2qWqj(x,y,z)u2qj=Wqu2q,whereWqjis a global shape function andu2qjis the value ofu2q׳at node j, andp2qis the number of nodes in the q direction. Following the previous section,Wx=Wy=Wz=W. The hybrid method implemented here follows the same general approach as that described by Kirby et al. [21,22] for elastic waveguides, see also Kirby [18] and Duan and Kirby [19] for acoustic waveguides. Accordingly, a weak form of Eq. (2) yields(9a)∫Ω2{[(λ+μ)∂WT∂x∂W∂x+μ∇WT∇W−ρω2WTW]u2x+[λ∂WT∂x∂W∂y++μ∂WT∂y∂W∂x]u2y+[λ∂WT∂x∂W∂z+μ∂WT∂z∂W∂x]u2z}dΩ2=∫Γ2WTh2xdΓ2,(9b)∫Ω2{[λ∂WT∂y∂W∂x+μ∂WT∂x∂W∂y]u2x+[(λ+μ)∂WT∂y∂W∂y+μ∇WT∇W−ρω2WTW]u2y+[λ∂WT∂y∂W∂z+μ∂WT∂z∂W∂y]u2z}dΩ2=∫Γ2WTh2ydΓ2,(9c)∫Ω2{[λ∂WT∂z∂W∂x+μ∂WT∂x∂W∂z]u2x+[λ∂WT∂z∂W∂y+μ∂WT∂y∂W∂z]u2y+[(λ+μ)∂WT∂z∂W∂z+μ∇WT∇W−ρω2WTW]u2z}dΩ2=∫Γ2WTh2zdΓ2.On the surface of regionΩ2that does not include planesΓAandΓBit is assumed that no external forces are applied so that tractionsh2qare equal to zero. However, on planesΓAandΓB, these traction forces are not zero and it is these surfaces that form the link to the modal expansions in regionsΩ1andΩ3. Accordingly, the displacements in regionsΩ1andΩ3are written as modal expansions so that(10)u1q׳(x,y,z)=∑n=0m1qAnu1q+n(x,y)e−ikγnz+∑n=0m1qBnu1q−n(x,y)eikγnz,(11)u3q׳(x,y,z׳)=∑n=0m1qCnu1q+n(x,y)e−ikγnz׳.HereAn,BnandCnare modal amplitudes, andu1q+nandu1q−nare eigenvectors for the incident and reflected waves, respectively. The number of modes in regionsΩ1andΩ3in directionqism1q, wherem1q≤p1q. It is assumed that the pipe extends to infinity in regionΩ3so that no reflected waves are present in this region. In addition, Eq. (10) allows for a general incident sound field, although in the analysis that follows this will be restricted either to torsionalT(0,1)or longitudinalL(0,2)excitation as this best reflects experimental practice.Continuity of the normal and shear stresses is enforced over planesΓAandΓBby substituting Eqs. (10) and (11) into Eqs. (9a)–(9c), and using the stress/strain relations in Eq. (4). This permits Eqs. (9a)–(9c) to be re-written as(12a)G22u2x+G32Tu2y+G42Tu2z+G21B+G25C=[Q1x+−Q1zx+]A,(12b)G32u2x+G33u2y+G43Tu2z+G31B+G35C=[Q1y+−Q1zy+]A,(12c)G42u2x+G43u2y+G44u2z+G41−B+G45C=−G41+A,whereA,BandCare vectors holding the modal amplitudesAn,BnandCnrespectively. The other matrices in these equations are given in Appendix B. Eq. (12a)–(12c) enforce the traction continuity conditions over planesΓAandΓB; continuity of displacement is enforced separately, which yields(13a)uq2(x,y,0)=∑n=0m1qAnu1q+n+∑n=0m1qBnu1q−nand(13b)uq2(x,y,L)=∑n=0m1qCnu1q+n,whereLis the length of regionΩ2, see Fig. 1. The displacement continuity equations are weighted by an appropriate weighting function and then integrated over planesΓAandΓBrespectively. The weighting function is chosen to take advantage of modal orthogonality where possible, see for example Gregory [28] for a discussion on orthogonality relations for elastic waves, and also Kirby et al. [21,22] for implementation in axisymmetric problems. The use of an appropriate semi-orthogonality relation also helps to deliver a convergent system of equations, which is crucial in delivering an accurate solution for the problem. Accordingly, the displacement on planeΓAin thexdirection is weighted withG21T, while in theyandzdirectionsG31TandG41−Tare used, respectively. ForΓAthis yields(14a)G21Tu2x+G31Tu2y+G41−Tu2z−G11−B=G11+A,and forΓB(14b)G25Tu2x+G35Tu2y+G45Tu2z+G55C=0.Finally, Eqs. (12a)–(12c) and (14a) and (14b) are grouped together to give the final system equation(15)[−G11−G21TG31TG41−T0G21G22G32TG42TG25G31G32G33G43TG35G41−G42G43G44G450G25TG35TG45TG55]{Bu2xu2yu2zC}={G11+A[Q1x+−Q1zx+]A[Q1y+−Q1zy+]A−G41+A0}.Eq. (15) is a set ofnt(=2m1+p2)linear equations, wherep2is the number of nodes in regionΩ2(p2=p2x+p2y+p2z), andm1is the number of modes in regionsΩ1andΩ3respectively (m1=m1x+m1y+m1z). The modal amplitudes inΩ1andΩ3, and the displacements in regionΩ2, are then found on the solution of Eq. (15). The frequency domain displacements in regionΩ1can be calculated from Eq. (10), and the corresponding time domain displacements in regionΩ1are easily obtained following an inverse Fourier transform.Eq. (15) is solved in the frequency domain. In order to generate a time domain response an incident pulse is first specified in the time domain, which is then transformed into the frequency domain using a discretised Fourier transform. The complex amplitude obtained for the pulse at each frequency is then used as the incident modal amplitude in Eq. (15). For the time domain predictions that follow, Eq. (15) is solved in the frequency domain at 3671 discrete frequencies, which delivers a frequency range suitable for minimising numerical noise whilst at the same time delivering an acceptable solution time. Following the frequency domain calculations an inverse Fourier transform is undertaken to generate the time domain predictions.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This article develops a three dimensional numerical approach to the analysis of elastic wave propagation in pipes with non-axisymmetric defects. The article introduces an alternative WRM approach to deriving the governing finite element equations and through the use of Galerkin׳s method a hybrid SAFE-FE method is developed that avoids multiplying global matrices before solving the problem. The modal and displacement solutions are obtained through solution of a final governing equation in the frequency domain, and time domain solutions are calculated from an inverse Fourier transform. A hybrid approach permits the study of long lengths of pipe and it is shown that for non axisymmetric defects energy is scattered into higher order flexural modes and the dispersive nature of these modes means that separating them in the time domain is likely to be difficult. Moreover, when attempting to recover the peak amplitude of a particular mode problems will occur because for all modes apart fromT(0,1)these amplitudes are a function of the axial location of the receiver on the pipe.The hybrid model is seen to converge quickly and for a non-axisymmetric defect the error in power balance is generally below 0.01% for a computation time of less than 3min for each frequency. Following this the time domain model currently takes about 13h to solve with the use of parallelisation techniques; however, if one tolerates lower levels of accuracy then this solution time may be significantly reduced. Accordingly a time domain model based on frequency calculations using the hybrid method presented here are seen to be significantly faster than using a full FE discretisation of the problem. Thus, this paper demonstrates that an FE based method can be used to solve a time domain scattering problem for an arbitrary defect in a long waveguide with an arbitrary cross-section. This article also demonstrates that it is possible to avoid problems caused by dispersion by working in thek−ωdomain using sensors placed along the pipe axis. This permits modal amplitudes for every propagating mode to be determined, which provides a significant increase in the information that may be extracted when compared to the analysis of amplitude in the time domain.(A1)P=[000Z41TZ51T0000Z51Z52T000000Z63TZ41Z51T000Z64TZ51Z52000Z65T00Z63Z64Z650](A2)S=[Z41TZ51T0000Z51Z52T000000Z63T000000−k2K2000000−k2K2000000τk2K2](A3)Z41=(τ−1)Kx+K1−k2K2(A4)Z51=(τ−2)KxyT+Kxy(A5)Z52=(τ−1)Ky+K1−k2K2(A6)Z63=−(K1−k2K2)(A7)Z64=ik[(2−τ)K3+K3T](A8)Z65=ik[(2−τ)K4+K4T](A9a,b)K1=∫Γ1∇NT∇NdΓ1andK2=∫Γ1NTNdΓ1(A10a,b)K3=∫Γ1NT∂N∂xdΓ1andK4=∫Γ1NT∂N∂ydΓ1(A11a,b)Kx=∫Γ1∂NT∂x∂N∂xdΓ1andKy=∫Γ1∂NT∂y∂N∂ydΓ1(A12)Kxy=∫Γ1∂NT∂x∂N∂ydΓ1Note thatτ=cL2/cT2.(A13a,b)Rx=∫Ω2∂WT∂x∂W∂xdΩ2andRy=∫Ω2∂WT∂y∂W∂ydΩ2(A14a,b)Rxy=∫Ω2∂WT∂x∂W∂ydΩ2andRxz=∫Ω2∂WT∂x∂W∂zdΩ2(A15a,b)Ryz=∫Ω2∂WT∂y∂W∂zdΩ2andRz=∫Ω2∂WT∂z∂W∂zdΩ2(A16a,b)R1=∫Ω2∇WT∇WdΩ2andR2=∫Ω2WTWdΩ2(A17)Q1x±=ikγn∫ΓAWTu1x±ndΓA,n=1,2…m1(A18)Q1zx±=∫ΓAWT∂u1z±n∂xdΓA,n=1,2…m1(A19)Q3x+=ikγn∫ΓBWTu1x+ndΓB,n=1,2…m1(A20)Q3zx+=∫ΓBWT∂u1z+n∂xdΓB,n=1,2…m1(A21)Q1y±=ikγn∫ΓAWTu1y±ndΓA,n=1,2…m1(A22)Q1zy±=∫ΓAWT∂u1z±n∂ydΓA,n=1,2…m1(A23)Q3y+=ikγn∫ΓBWTu1y+ndΓB,n=1,2…m1(A24)Q3zy+=∫ΓBWT∂u1z+n∂ydΓB,n=1,2…m1(A25)Q1z±=ikγn∫ΓAWTu1z±ndΓA,n=1,2…m1(A26)Q1xx±=∫ΓAWT∂u1x±n∂xdΓA,n=1,2…m1(A27)Q1yy±=∫ΓAWT∂u1y±n∂ydΓA,n=1,2…m1(A28)Q3z+=ikγn∫ΓBWTu1z+ndΓB,n=1,2…m1(A29)Q3xx+=∫ΓBWT∂u1x+n∂xdΓB,n=1,2…m1(A30)Q3yy+=∫ΓBWT∂u1y+n∂ydΓB,n=1,2…m1(A31)M1q±=ikγm∫ΓAu1q−mu1q±ndΓA(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A32)M1zxx±=∫ΓA∂u1z−m∂xu1x±ndΓA(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A33)M1zyy±=∫ΓA∂u1z−m∂yu1y±ndΓA(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A34)M1xxz±=∫ΓA∂u1x−m∂xu1z±ndΓA(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A35)M1yyz±=∫ΓA∂u1y−m∂yu1z±ndΓA(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A36)M3q±=ikγm∫ΓBu1q+mu1q±ndΓB(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A37)M3zxx±=∫ΓA∂u1z+m∂xu1x±ndΓA(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A38)M3zyy±=∫ΓA∂u1z+m∂yu1y±ndΓA(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A39)M3xxz±=∫ΓA∂u1x+m∂xu1z±ndΓA(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A40)M3yyz±=∫ΓA∂u1y+m∂yu1z±ndΓA(m=0,1,⋯,m1;n=0,1,⋯,m1)(A41)G11±=M1x±+M1zxx±+M1y±+M1zyy±+τM1z±+(τ−2)M1xxz±+(τ−2)M1yyz±(A42)G21=Q1x−+Q1zx−(A43)G31=Q1y−+Q1zy−(A44)G41±=(τ−2)Q1xx±+(τ−2)Q1yy±∓τQ1z±(A45)G22=(τ−1)Rx+R1−k2R2(A46)G32=(τ−2)RxyT+Rxy(A47)G42=(τ−2)RxzT+Rxz(A48)G33=(τ−1)Ry+R1−k2R2(A49)G43=(τ−2)RyzT+Ryz(A50)G44=(τ−1)Rz+R1−k2R2(A51)G25=Q3x+−Q3zx+(A52)G35=Q3y+−Q3zy+(A53)G45=−(τ−2)Q3xx+−(τ−2)Q3yy++τQ3z+(A55)G55=−M3x++M3zxx+−M3y++M3zyy+−τM3z++(τ−2)M3xxz++(τ−2)M3yyz+
