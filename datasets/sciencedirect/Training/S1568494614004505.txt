@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The present paper proposes systematic designs of stable adaptive fuzzy logic controllers (AFLCs), employing hybridizations of Lyapunov strategy based approach (LSBA) and a contemporary stochastic optimization technique, for controlling the temperature of a thermal process in an air-heater system with transport-delay and in the presence of disturbances. Harmony search (HS) algorithm has been considered here as a candidate stochastic optimization technique utilized in conjunction with the Lyapunov theory to develop the hybrid models in this work. The objective of this work is to design stable adaptive fuzzy controllers which can provide high degree of automation, guarantee asymptotic stability and also achieve satisfactory transient performance by simultaneous adaptations of both the fuzzy controller structure and its free parameters. The results obtained from real-life experiments aptly demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In industrial thermal processes, sometimes it is a difficult task to place the temperature sensor at a location close to the heating element, such as in different furnaces [1–4,20]. Thus due to the physical separation between the sensors and the heating element a transport-delay is introduced in the thermal process. Along with this difficulty, the system may suffer from significant external disturbances which may primarily arise because of the presence of one/more blower(s) in the process, which can effectively change the hot air mass flow rate. The temperature controller employed to control the temperature of the process at different locations should be able to cope with such variations and unwanted/unforeseeable situations. Researchers, during the last two decades, have continuously proved that the conventional PID type controllers are not suitable for these types of applications [1,5–7] and several research works have corroborated the fact that fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) possess tremendous potential to find their applications in these fields [8,10,12]. Several researchers are also motivated by the hybrid design methodologies combining fuzzy control theory with genetic algorithm to accommodate the complexities of the system to be controlled [9,13,18,19]. In this work, a small-scale, real version of a typical industrial thermal process is developed in our laboratory to emulate an air heater thermal process and it presents an excellent opportunity to test our designed stable adaptive fuzzy control methodologies in these situations. Typically, such a process is modeled as a first order linear system, but the situation gets complicated because of the variable heat transfer dynamics which arises due to variation of speed of the blower fan, fitted at one end of the air flow duct [11]. The air mass flow rate is primarily dependent on the blower speed, thus a change in that speed effectively acts as a load disturbance, influencing the heat transfer dynamics of the air heater process. In this work, our designed hybrid stable adaptive fuzzy controllers (AFLCs), which combine the good features of Lyapunov theory [12] and harmony search (HS) optimization based strategies to evolve superior control alternatives [14], [15], are applied to effectively control the temperature of this air heater process at different cross sections of the air flow duct. These proposed hybrid controllers can effectively control the temperature of a process with such variable heat transfer dynamics and the same controllers are also able to cope with the transportation delay inherently present in the process due to the physical separation between the heating element and temperature sensors.As mentioned before, in this work, a contemporary stochastic optimization technique, called harmony search (HS) algorithm (proposed by Geem [21,22]), is employed individually and hybridized with Lyapunov theory to design our proposed stable AFLCs. The Lyapunov theory provides a local adaptation feature to the fuzzy controllers and ensures the stability of the controller. On the other hand, a multi agent stochastic optimization algorithm, like HS algorithm, is adept in providing good global-search capability, required to provide high degree of automation in the controller design strategies. Two variants of these newly proposed hybrid design strategies, namely concurrent and preferential models, are utilized for controlling the temperature of the air heater process. The motivation of this present paper is to design a stable adaptive fuzzy controller in offline manner, considering the real-life operational environment of the system, and then apply the same for real-life operation. In this present work, at the onset, the process parameters are estimated with real-time input–output data. Then utilizing that the fuzzy controller's structure and free parameters are obtained using HS algorithm and LSBA approach which, in tern, guaranteed the stability of the designed controller. The performances of the controllers are first validated in simulation. Finally the proposed controllers have been implemented in real-life laboratory experiments for our indigenously built laboratory-scale air heater system and the satisfactory performances are demonstrated for both with transport-delay and without transport-delay situations and, also, in presence of fixed and randomly varying load disturbances.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a hardware description of the laboratory-scale experimental air heater system. Section 3 details how the modeling of the experimental system is carried out and how the parameter estimation of this system is achieved in real-life. Section 4 describes the design of stable adaptive fuzzy controllers for this process. Section 5 presents the newly proposed HS algorithm based hybrid adaptation strategies, while in Section 6 simulation and real-life experimental studies for proposed hybrid adaptation strategies are demonstrated. Section 7 concludes the paper.The experimental platform for the practical experiment for controlling the temperature of an air heater system, employing stable AFLC consists of a laboratory scale hardware system, indigenously developed, interfaced to a PC through USB port. The experimental arrangement draws air from the atmosphere using a blower fan, the air is then heated as it passes over a heater coil and then this air is released in the atmosphere through a duct, as shown in Fig. 1(a)–(c). Temperature control at desired value is achieved by varying the applied voltage to the heater coil. The air temperature has been sensed by using LM35 temperature sensors placed along the path of the flow at different positions of the duct. The spatial separation between the sensor #1 and the heater coil is negligibly small but the other two sensors are at a distance of 15cm and 30cm respectively from the heater coil, and that introduces a transport delay into the system for those two sensors. The proposed control algorithms are implemented in Visual Basic on standard PC, with 250GB HD, 2GB RAM, Windows XP operating system. The PC communicates with the designed air heater system which comprises an embedded system with 28 pin DIP PIC18F2550 processor, through USB link. The power module of the heater coil and its control signal from the PIC processor is shown in Fig. 2. An interrupt-driven software is developed for this sophisticated temperature control scheme which has a sampling rate of 100ms for each PWM cycle generated for control action. A four pin BLDC type CPU fan is utilized as a blower for the air heater system and its speed is also suitably controlled by the PIC processor. The maximum speed of the blower is 2800rpm and that can be varied, in terms of the percentage of the maximum speed, during the experiment which acts as a disturbance to the process.The design technique of a stable adaptive fuzzy controller, for controlling the temperature of air at different points along the cross-section of the duct in the air heater system, requires the knowledge of the nominal parameters of the process for tuning the controller. Thus, before designing the controllers, the parameters of the air heating process is estimated, i.e. the process to be controlled is identified, using HS algorithm [16].The system identification problem can be viewed as the construction of a mathematical model for a dynamic process using the knowledge and observations of that process. The objectives of system identification are to (i) select a feasible model structure describing the process to be controlled and (ii) estimate the model parameters with a minimum estimation error. Fig. 1(d) gives a block diagram representation of the air heater system.Let the voltage input to the process be Vin. The temperature sensor produces an output voltage Vop, where ‘p’ represents the sensor number. The output of each temperature sensor is proportional to ΔT, the rise in air temperature in the duct from the ambient air temperature. So, the sensor output voltages are Vo1, Vo2 and Vo3 for sensor #1, sensor #2 and sensor #3 respectively and they are expressed in general as:(1)Vop=SkpΔTwhere Skp, p=1, 2, and 3, are the gains of the individual temperature sensors.Let τd2 be the transportation delay for sensor #2 and this denote the time taken by the hot air to flow from the heater coil to the sensor #2, similarly τd3 denotes the transportation delay for sensor #3. However, as mentioned before, that the sensor #1 is placed very near to the heater coil and thus it can be assumed that there is no transport delay τd1 involved for sensor #1. Thus the transfer functions between the heater input voltage and the sensor output voltages of sensor #1, sensor #2 and sensor #3 respectively can be expressed as:(2)G1(s)=V01(s)Vin(s)=K1τs+1,G2(s)=V02(s)Vin(s)=K2e−τd2sτs+1,G3(s)=V03(s)Vin(s)=K3e−τd3sτs+1where K1=k1k2Sk1, K2=k1k2Sk2 and K3=k1k2Sk3 are the dc gains of that process for different sensor positions along the duct and τ is the RC time constant of the heat transfer dynamics. Since the temperature sensors used to measure the temperature of the process at different cross-sections of the duct are identical in nature, so Sk1=Sk2=Sk3 and, thus the dc gains K1, K2 and K3 are practically equal and therefore, we can write, K1=K2=K3=K.In this present paper, the parameters of this process are identified by using HS algorithm, for that purpose, the state model of this process considering temperature measurement at sensor #1 can be derived as:(3)x˙1=−1τx1+Kτu(t)y=x1where, y=Vo1, the output voltage of sensor #1, in volt (V), and u=Vinin volt (V).The unknown parameters of this process are: the dc gain of the process (K) and the time constant of the heat transfer dynamics (τ). The open-loop test data of the input voltage applied to the heater coil and its corresponding temperature measured from sensor #1, for duration of 1500s, are acquired at an interval of 100ms, keeping the speed of the blower fan fixed to its 50% of rated speed. The voltage that is applied to the heater coil for the identification of its parameters is a randomly varying signal with its voltage level in the range 150–200V. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the plot of the open-loop input voltage and the corresponding temperature measured at sensor #1.In HS algorithm based system identification, a candidate solution vector in solution space is a vector containing all required information to obtain the model of the air heater process. This candidate vectorZis formed as [14,15]:(4)Z_=[K|τ]The modified HS algorithm as presented in [15], is utilized to identify the unknown parameters of the air heater process. Here HS algorithms determine the best vector comprising the unknown parameters as shown in (4) for which discrepancy between the model output and the actual experimental output data, for the same input, is minimum, considering the entire set of input–output real-life data. The integral absolute error (IAE) is used as the fitness function (or performance index) for the optimization technique and IAE can be defined asIAE=∑n=0Nd(n)Δtc, where d(n)=discrepancy between the model output and the actual experimental output data, N=number of data points and Δtc=sampling time for collected data. The results obtained after 10 test runs are utilized for identification of the parameters of the air heater system. In present paper, those parameters are estimated as average of the free parameters obtained over 10 test runs using HS algorithms and these are obtained as K=0.2496 and τ=90.7831s.Further, the identified process is tested for different test input voltages as shown in Fig. 3(c), (e) and (g). The open-loop responses for those test input voltages from the identified model and actual process are shown in Fig. 3(d), (f) and (h) respectively and the open-loop responses show that the performance of the identified model of the process and the actual process are quite close to each other, in each case. In all the study the speed of the blower fan is kept fixed at 50% of its rated speed, same as process parameter identification stage. Thus, the HS algorithm based hybrid controllers are designed on the basis of these estimated parameters of the air heater process.In this section, first the control objective is formulated in a general way for a class of nth order single input single output (SISO) systems and then the adaptation strategy has been designed for the air heater process as in (3). Let us consider that, the objective is to design an adaptive strategy for an nth order SISO non-linear plant given as [12,17]:(5)x(n)=f(x_)+buy=xwhere f(·) is an unknown continuous function, u∈R and y∈R are the input and output of the plant, and b is an unknown positive constant.Let us assume that the state vector is given asx_=(x1,x2,…,xn)T=(x,x˙,…x(n−1))T∈Rn. The control objective is to force the plant output y(t) to follow a given bounded reference signal ym(t) under the constraints that all closed-loop variables involved must be bounded to guarantee the closed-loop stability of the system. Thus, the tracking error is e=ym−y.The objective is to design a stable adaptive fuzzy controller for the system described in (5). AFLCs have evolved as popular control solutions for those classes of plants whose input–output characteristics are not precisely known. In case of the system in (5), this is given by the condition when f(·) and b are not precisely known, which is widely prevalent in practical situations. Here it is needed to find the structure of the fuzzy controller as well as a feedback control strategyu=u(x_θ_), using fuzzy logic system and an adaptive law for adjusting the parameter vectorθ_such that the following conditions are satisfied:(i)The closed-loop system must be globally stable in the sense that all variables,x_(t),θ_(t)andu(x_θ_)must be uniformly bounded, i.e.x_(t)≤Mx<∞,θ_(t)≤Mθ<∞andu(x_θ_)≤Mu<∞, where Mx, Mθand Muare set by the designer.The tracking error e(t) should be as small as possible under the constraints in (i) and thee_−θ_space should be stable in the large for the system.Now the ideal control law for the system in (5) and a reference signal ym(t) is given as [12,14,17]:(6)u*=1b[−f(x_)+ym(n)+k_Te_]whereym(n)is the nth derivative of the reference signal,e_=(e,e˙,…,e(n−1))Tis the error vector andk_=(k1,k2,…,kn)T∈Rnis the vector describing the desired closed-loop dynamics for the error.This definition implies that u*guarantees perfect tracking, i.e.y(t)≡ym(t)ifLtt→∞e(t)=0. But in practical situations, since f and b are not known precisely, the ideal u*of (6) cannot be implemented in real practice. Thus a suitable solution can be to design a fuzzy logic system to approximate this optimal control law.Now, to ensure the stability, it has been assumed that the control u(t) is given by the summation of a fuzzy control,uc(x_θ_), and an additional supervisory controlus(x_)[12,14]. Thus u(t) is given as:(7)u(t)=uc(x_θ_)+us(x_)It has been assumed that the AFLC is constructed using a zero order Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy system. Thenuc(x_θ_)for the AFLC is given in the form [14]:(8)uc(x_θ_)=∑l=1Nθl∗αl(x_)∑l=1Nαl(x_)=θ_T∗ξ(x_)whereθ_=[θ1,θ2,…,θN]T=the vector of the output singletons,αl(x_)=∏i=1rμil(xi)=the firing degree of rule‘l’, N=the total number of rules,μil(xi)=the membership value of theith input membership function(MF)in the activatedlth rule,ξ_(x_)=vectorcontaining normalized firing strength of all fuzzy IF–THENrules=(ξ1(x_),ξ2(x_),…,ξN(x_))Tand(9)ξl(x_)=αl(x_)∑l=1Nαl(x_)Let us define a quadratic form of tracking error asVe=(1/2)e_TPe_where P is a symmetric positive definite matrix satisfying the Lyapunov equation and us(x), in this present paper, is constructed as given in [12] and can be presented as:(10)us(x_)=I1∗sgn(e_TPb_c)uc+1bL(fU+ym(n)+k_Te_)whereI1∗=1ifVe>V¯I1∗=0ifVe≤V¯, andV¯is a constant specified by the designer, andfU≥f(x_)and0<bL≤b.With the use of us(x) it can be shown thatV˙e≤−(1/2)e_TQe_≤0, where Q is a positive definite matrix [12,13]. The zero order T–S type fuzzy control uc(x|θ) can be so constructed that it will produce a linear weighted combination of adapted parameter vectorθ. Thus a simple singleton based adaptation law, as proposed in [12,13] can be given as:(11)θ˙_=νe_Tp_nξ_(x_)where ν>0 is the adaptation gain or learning rate andpnis the last column of P. Thus, using supervisory control us(x), one can guaranteeVe≤V¯, which implies the boundedness inx[12]. Hence, the closed-loop stability of the system is guaranteed.Therefore, from (3) and (5), it is revealed that for air heater system considered in this paper,f(x_)=−(1/τ)x1and b=K/τ, and the other theoretical aspect as discussed can readily be applied to control the temperature of the air heater system with guaranteed closed-loop stability.The present paper proposes systematic designs of stable adaptive fuzzy logic controllers (AFLCs) employing hybridizations of Lyapunov strategy based approach (LSBA) and HS algorithm. The objectives of these design strategies are to perform simultaneous adaptations of both the FLC structure and its free parameters, so that two competing requirements can be fulfilled: (i) to guarantee stability of the controllers designed and (ii) to achieve very high degrees of automation in the process of these controller designs by employing a global search method.In the present paper, two novel variants of hybridization of locally operative Lyapunov theory and globally operative HS algorithm technique have been proposed. These approaches are generally named as hybrid strategy based approaches (HydSBA). The two hybrid approaches proposed are called the concurrent and preferential combinations of Lyapunov theory and HS algorithm.In proposed stochastic algorithm based controller design, a candidate solution vector (CSV) in solution space is a vector containing all required information to construct a fuzzy controller, e.g. (i) information about the number and positions of the membership functions (MFs) in which each input variable of the fuzzy controller is fuzzified, (ii) number of rules, (iii) values of scaling gains, (iv) positions of the output singletons, etc. This vector is formed as [14,19]:(12)Z_=[structural flags for MFs|center locations of the MFs|…|scaling gains|positions of the output singletons]Each structural flag bears the information about the existence or non-existence of an MF in its corresponding variable. It can only take binary values where ‘0′ indicates the non-existence and ‘1′ indicates the existence of the corresponding MF. However, the stochastic algorithms considered in this paper are the algorithms where each entry in the CSV can take continuous values. Hence, for each structural flag in the vector, the universe of discourse is set as [0,1]. Subsequently, the flag is set to 0, if the continuous value of the variable is <0.5, and the flag is set to 1, if the variable is ≥0.5. Total number of 1's in the structural flags keeps changing in each iteration and hence the total number of MFs in which an input variable is fuzzified also changes in each iteration. This causes a change in the structure of the AFLC in each iteration as it changes the total number of MFs for each input variable, which changes the total number of rules of the fuzzy rule base and hence changes the total number of active output singletons. Each input is fuzzified using triangular MFs and the center locations of the MFs in the CSV stores the peaks of the MFs. Each input is fuzzified in the range [0,1] with two fixed triangular MFs having their peaks fixed at 0 and 1 respectively. All intermediate MFs for that input variable are flexible in nature. They can be either active or inactive during an iteration and their peaks are also adapted by stochastic algorithms in each iteration. For each MF the peaks of the immediate adjacent active MFs on either side of its own peak forms the left and right base support of it. Whether the immediate adjacent MF is an active MF or not is determined by the status of its corresponding structural flag. Hence, some of the center locations of MFs are ignored while evaluating the AFLC output, because their corresponding entries in the structural flags are zero. A similar logic holds true for the output singletons in a CSV. Here, those singletons become inactive whose antecedent parts contain one or more input MFs which become inactive in that iteration.To design an AFLC utilizing HS algorithms, first the population of CSV chosen, then the algorithm will decide the structure of the candidate controller according to its structural flags. The candidate controller simulation (CCS) algorithm, as shown in Fig. 4(a), is implemented for each on the candidate controller to calculate the fitness function (FF), the integral absolute error (IAE), which can be defined asIAE=∑n=0PSTe(n)Δtc, where PST=plant simulation time and Δtc=step size or sampling time. Then, according to the value of the fitness function (IAE) of each CSV in each iteration, the best solution is achieved using the HS algorithm [15]. The HS algorithm will stop searching the solution space when the number of iterations specified by the designer is reached or a pre specified error is attained by the controller. The flowchart representation of stochastic algorithm based AFLC design is shown in Fig. 4(b).In hybrid strategy based approach (HydSBA), the Lyapunov theory of adapting the output singletons of the T–S fuzzy controller, as represented in Fig. 5(a)[12,14,17], is utilized under the supervision of the HS algorithm based approach to design stable fuzzy controller to get a superior systematic procedure for a class of SISO systems. Now the adaptation law as in (11) is revised in light of the Lyapunov theory based adaptation of the output singletonsθ_as [12]:(13)θ_=νe_Tp_nξ_(q_)if(θ_<Mθ)or(θ_=Mθande_Tp_nθ_Tξ_(q_)≤0)Proj{νe_Tp_nξ_(q_)}if(θ_=Mθande_Tp_nθ_Tξ_(q_)>0)where Proj{∗} is the projection operator and is given by(14)Proj{νe_Tp_nξ_(q_)}=νe_Tp_nξ_(q_)−νe_Tp_nθ_θ_Tξ_(q_)θ_2The optimization process of the controller is derived in two different ways to explore the possibility of getting superior results [14,15]. These two hybrid strategies are described now.In this design process the Lyapunov based approach and the HS algorithm based approach run concurrently or parallely to optimize the (i) structure of the controller, (ii) scaling gains and (iii) positions of the output singletons.In this method a harmonyZis divided into two sub-groups, unlike HSABA design methodology and is given as:(15)Z_=[ψ_θ_]where(16)ψ_=[structural flags for MFs|centre locations of the MFs|scaling gains]θ_=[position of the output singletons]The partition ofZvector separates the parameters accordingly asψhas non-linear influence andθhas linear influence on uc, respectively [19]. In Lyapunov strategy based approach (LSBA) of adaptation the values of the free parameters in the vectorψare defined a priori and the value of the correspondingθminimizing the tracking error can be obtained by the adaptation law as in (11) or (13). Conventionally theψis set by hand tuned trial and error method, but in this present workψis set by the HS algorithm. In this present paper, HS algorithm is applied to optimizeψandθin tandem. In addition to that, adaptation law, as in (11), is applied to every updated candidate controller to adjust the value ofθonly. So, in this method,θexplores both the local search space by (11) and global search space by (15), simultaneously, in a two-fold manner. The flowchart representation of HydSBA-concurrent model algorithm is shown in Fig. 5(b).In this proposed model the HSABA method and the HydSBA-concurrent method both are employed to keep the tracking error as minimum as possible. Here, each harmony in the harmony memory, i.e. each candidate controller, evaluates the CCS algorithm and the LSBA algorithm separately at a time. The fitness values of the candidate controller, evaluated by employing both the CCS algorithm and the LSBA algorithm, as shown in Figs. 4(a) and 5(a) respectively, are then compared, and then the fitness value of the better algorithm is taken as the guiding factor for the update operation of the candidate solution vector according to respective stochastic algorithms. If the LSBA algorithm is proven better for that CSV in that iteration, then the process will follow the concurrent hybrid model, otherwise, the process will follow the HSABA method in that iteration. Thus, in this process, each CSV in a population does not follow the same rule, even within the same iteration, to search the solution space. In a particular iteration of evaluation, some CSV follow the HSABA method and some other follow the concurrent hybrid method. This process of evolution is performed in each iteration afresh for each CSV, so that the same CSV may follow different update rules in different iterations. This method is proposed with an objective of avoiding getting stuck in local minima. The flowchart representation of HydSBA-preferential model algorithm is shown in Fig. 6.The air temperature sensing is carried out at sensor #1 of the air heater system, for both design and implementation purpose. For this practical system, the AFLCs are designed with potentially biggest 7 input MFs, for the simulation case study as well as for the experimental case study. During the simulation, the process models are simulated each using a fixed step 4th order Runge–Kutta method. To perform the simulation, a population size of 10 harmonies for HS algorithm is chosen. For each simulation, 200 iterations of harmony improvisations are performed. The stable adaptive control strategies, as mentioned before, tuning of the center locations of the input MFs, free parameters of the controller and the positions of the output singletons, to minimize the integral absolute error (IAE) between the reference signal and the actual temperature measured from the air heater process. The sampling time is taken as 100ms in conformation with the hardware driver circuit requirement. The value of the adaptation gain is chosen as ν=0.0001, considering both exploration capability of the design algorithm and inherent approximation error present in the process. The values of the other design parameters are chosen as: P=0.1,V¯=1, fU=1, k=0.001. The simulation is performed for 900s. In this variable structure controller design, the structural flags are utilized to optimize the structure of the controller and the input MFs and the corresponding positions of the output singletons are also set according to these structural flags. As a sample case study, the design procedure of variable structure HydSBA-Pref controller has been graphically represented in Fig. 7. The maximum number of input and output MF's are taken as 7 and initially the input triangular MF's are uniformly distributed over the universe of discourse of fuzzy input space [0,+1] and all the 7 output singletons are at ‘0′ position of its corresponding universe of discourse [−5,+5] as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b) respectively. The structure of the FLC is optimized by HS algorithm to achieve a near optimal solution and thus the finally adapted values of the input MF's (here it is 5 in number) and the corresponding output singletons are depicted in Fig. 7(c) and (d) respectively. The input scaling gain is required to fuzzify the crisp input to fuzzy input and the output scaling gain is necessary for converting the fuzzy output of the controller to crisp output. In this case study the values of finally adapted input and output gains are 72.0571 and 43.6225 respectively. Along with the structural information of the hybrid fuzzy controller, the output response of the controller and sample values of f(x), u(t) and Ve(t) are also calculated for simulation case study of HydSBA-Pref at different sampling instants and the graphical representation of each of them are shown in Fig. 7(e), (f), (g) and (h) respectively. We have also performed additional experimentations to compare performances of our proposed controllers with three different conventional and well known control strategies, namely, (i) a conventional PID controller (designed using Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules based on process reaction curve method with the designed gains as: kP=16.4471, kI=1.2093, kD=0.9200), (ii) a fixed structure Mamdani-type fuzzy controller (with five evenly distributed MFs for each input fuzzification) whose scaling gains are tuned using rigorous trial-and-error based method, and (iii) conventional LSBA based fuzzy controller (a fixed structure fuzzy controller having five evenly distributed MFs for each input fuzzification, adapted using Lyapunov theory). These comparative results are reported in Table 1. It can be seen that each of our proposed control strategies produced superior results compared to the other three competing controllers. In this case, HydSBA-Con model based control strategy produced the best result and HydSBA-Pref model based controller emerged as the second best solution, as given in terms of thee IAE value and the number of rules in Table 1.To demonstrate the utility of the proposed AFLC design strategies in real implementation situation, the temperature control of the air heater process is next performed in practical condition. The AFLCs trained during the simulation case studies are used to perform the temperature control in real implementation. In the air heater process as discussed, there are three temperature sensors and among them sensor #1 is placed just above the heater coil. Thus the heat transfer dynamics measured at sensor #1 does not involve or involve negligible transport delay, if any. The heat transfer dynamics is significantly sensitive to the blower speed as this can change the air mass flow rate. Therefore, the blower speed can be treated as a disturbance for the air heater process. A steady value of the blower speed provides a fixed disturbance and here the blower speed is kept fixed at 50% of the maximum speed for fixed type of disturbance. On the other hand, a randomly variable blower speed provides variable disturbances and here it is varied randomly between 60% and 80% of the maximum blower speed, as shown in Fig. 8. As a sample graphical representation the performances of the variable structure HydSBA-Pref model in controlling the temperature at sensor #1 are shown in Figs. 9(a) and 10(a), for fixed blower speed disturbance and randomly variable blower speed disturbances, respectively. In these experimental case studies, the performances of different competing control strategies, as mentioned in Section 6.1, are evaluated too by calculating the IAE values for 900s evaluation period. The results reported in Table 2demonstrate that the HS algorithm based preferential hybrid control strategy emerged as the best control option for both fixed and randomly variable blower speed disturbances, in terms of IAE values. Hence, these experimental studies also conclusively proved that HS based hybrid controllers can outperform the conventional PID, basic Mamdani-type FLC and LSBA controllers on most occasions.To demonstrate the robustness of the hybrid and non-hybrid controllers, they are employed to control the temperature of the air heater process, where the temperature is now measured at the location of the sensor #3 and feedback for performing control action. Here the same controllers are implemented that were designed on the basis of temperature sensed at sensor #1. The objective of this case study is to demonstrate that the controller designed for the “no transport delay” situation is still robust enough for those situations where it is not possible to place the temperature sensor right at the ideal place where the temperature should be monitored but has to be placed at a distant place, because of the practical constraints. The experimental results, as depicted in Table 2, illustrate that, although, on most occasions, the IAE values are higher than the corresponding values of the previous experimental case study, but the basic requirement of temperature control is achieved in both fixed and randomly variable disturbance environments, as shown in Figs. 9(b) and 10(b) respectively, on sample basis for HydSBA-Pref model as in earlier case study. In this case study too, the HydSBA-Pref model evolved as the superior control option in comparison to all other competing controllers, as is evident from the results in Table 2. Thus, this experimental case study has also demonstrated that HydSBA-Pref model evolved as the best control option, on the whole, and the designed controllers are to a large extent adequately robust to provide the satisfactory performances.
