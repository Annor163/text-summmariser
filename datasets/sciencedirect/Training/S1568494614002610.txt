@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Traditional data mining methods emphasize on analytical abilities to decipher data, assuming that data are static during a mining process. We challenge this assumption, arguing that we can improve the analysis by vitalizing data. In this paper, this principle is used to develop a new clustering algorithm.Inspired by herd behavior, the clustering method is a synergistic approach using collective intelligence called Herd Clustering (HC). The novel part is laid in its first stage where data instances are represented by moving particles. Particles attract each other locally and form clusters by themselves as shown in the case studies reported. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the performance of HC is compared to other state-of-the art clustering methods on more than thirty datasets using four performance metrics. An application for DNA motif discovery is also conducted. The results support the effectiveness of HC and thus the underlying philosophy.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Nowadays, with the support of science and technology, large amounts of data have been, and will continue to be, accumulated. For example, a single human genome accounts for about four gigabytes data space [62,63,65] and the transaction logs in financial markets are measured in billions each day [17]. Such a large amount of data is overwhelming and prevents us from applying traditional analysis techniques. Large-scale methods need to be devised to handle it. As one of the main analysis tools, cluster analysis methods have been proposed to separate the large amount of data into clusters. The data clustering methods are unsupervised which means there is not any label for model training; we do not even know the exact number of clusters beforehand. Given a set of data, a clustering method is expected to divide the data into several clusters by itself. Formally speaking, given a set of data instances, a data clustering method is expected to divide the set of data instances into the subsets which maximize the intra-subset similarity and inter-subset dissimilarity, where a similarity measure is defined beforehand.To tackle the problem, we propose and describe a novel clustering method in this study. It novelties lie in two aspects: (1) The proposed method is inspired from the nature, herd behavior, which is a commonly seen phenomenon in the real world including human mobility patterns [46]. Thus it is very intuitive and easy to be understood for its good performance. (2) The proposed method demonstrates that cluster analysis can be done in a non-traditional way by making data alive. We have also applied the proposed method to DNA motif discovery, demonstrating its real-world applicability. In addition, this study gives a comprehensive and fair comparison for different methods because each method has been well-tuned for each dataset tested fairly.The rest of paper is organized as follows: First, the related works are reviewed and discussed. After that, the new clustering algorithm is described in detail in the subsequent sections. For the sake of clarity, case studies are implemented and used to help us grasp the intuition of the proposed method. To observe its overall performance, it is compared with the other methods on more than thirty datasets. An application on DNA motif discovery is reported. Based on the results, we discussed the pros and cons of the method proposed at the end.
