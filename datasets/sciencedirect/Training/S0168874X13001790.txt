@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A computationally efficient C0 finite element model is developed for laminated composite and sandwich plates by implementing the inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory recently developed by the authors. This model is used to determine responses of general laminates subjected to various combinations of boundary conditions. The present formulation has been generalized for all existing shear deformation theories involving shear strain function. An eight noded serendipity element with 56 degrees of freedom is used to discretize the plate domain. Influences of lamination sequence (cross ply and angle ply), span to thickness ratio, and boundary conditions are investigated for the flexural behavior of laminated composite and sandwich plates. Further, the stability behavior of plates subjected to in-plane loads (uni-axial and bi-axial) is investigated for a variety of examples. Effects of boundary conditions and applied loads on the critical buckling loads and buckling mode shapes are also assessed for a class of laminates in order to show the efficacy of the present mathematical technique to predict the buckling mode shapes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The use of composite material for the structure/component design has grown significantly over the last few decades because their response characteristics can be tailored to meet specific design requirements. Furthermore, composite structures possess high specific stiffness and high specific strength which leads to overall reduction of weight, thereby increasing the efficiency of the structure.The plates form an essential component for the structural design in aerospace, naval, civil and automobile industries. In many applications, laminated composite and sandwich plates are subjected to transverse and in-plane loads. The excessive stresses induced due to application of these loads may cause failure. In addition to excessive stresses, in-plane compressive loads may alter the equilibrium configuration of a flat plate and hence cause failure due to buckling. Therefore, a compendious and reliable treatment for the behavior of the composite plates becomes essential. Various mathematical techniques regarding the formulation of the plate problem, structural kinematics, and solution methodology have been developed in the past few decades. A plate problem can be formulated using the elasticity principles or energy methods. The formulation using the theory of elasticity becomes complicated for composite plates since the involvement of field variables is large as compared to monolithic plates. Structural kinematics comprises of displacement based, stress based or hybrid approaches. Exact and approximate solutions can be implemented to solve the coupled differential equations for the laminated composite plate. The significance of shear deformation [1–4] in composite plates necessitates the use of shear deformation theories instead of classical plates theories based upon Kirchoff's hypothesis. Reissner [5,6] studied the effects of transverse shear deformation on the elastic plates using the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT). The requirement of shear correction factor and its dependency on the boundary conditions, stacking sequence, and lamination sequence make FSDT less realistic [7]. Higher-order shear deformation theories (HSDTs) involving parabolic transverse shear distribution were proposed by Levinson [8], Lo et al. [9], and Reddy [10]. Over the last few decades, the rapid advancements in the use of composite structures have motivated researchers to develop rigorous plate theories accounting for accurate structural kinematics especially shear deformation. Notably among them are due to Kant and Pandya [11], Touratier [12], Soldatos [13], Karama et al. [14], Aydogdu [15], Meiche et al. [16], Grover et al. [17], and Mantari et al. [18,19]. In recent years, researchers have focused on inter-laminar continuity (IC) and Zig-Zag (ZZ) requirement [20] in addition to shear deformation. These classes of theories are called layerwise (LW) and zig-zag theories. The significant evolution towards this class of theories is due to Lee and Liu [21], Di Sciuva [22], Murakami [23], Cho and Parmerter [24], Carrera [25], Ferreira et al. [26], Roque et al. [27], and Pandit et al. [28,29]. These theories predict the inter-laminar behavior at the cost of high computational efforts since the involvement of field variables is large. Along with the development of plate theories, there has been significant development towards the solution methodologies. Analytical solutions are most accurate and different analytical techniques have been proposed for structural responses of laminated composite plates; however, they are applicable for a particular class of plate configuration and hence less appropriate for practical applications. The development of computational technologies in the present industry makes it quite possible to implement numerical/approximate methods for the practical applications. In the numerical investigations, Ritz methods [30], finite strip method [31,32], discrete singular convolution (DSC) method [33], finite element method (FEM) [34,35], and mesh-less methods [26] have been widely used for the structural responses. Among these, FEM is most popular and versatile method for investigating the structural behavior of arbitrary shaped components. The development of finite element methods and shear deformation theories has been well documented in the review articles by Noor and Burton [36], Reddy [37], Reddy and Robbins [38], Mallikarjuna and Kant [39], Liu and Li [40], Ghugal and Shimpi [41], Carrera [42,] and Zhang and Yang [43].In the present work, a generalized finite element model for laminated composite and sandwich plates by implementing recently developed an inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory (IHSDT) by the authors [44] is formulated in view of assessing responses of general laminates subjected to various combination of boundary conditions. The present inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory requires the use of C1 continuous element; however, in the present work, additional degrees of freedom are imposed in order to reduce the continuity requirement to C0 thereby making it computationally more efficient. Moreover, the finite element modeling has been generalized for all existing shear deformation theories involving shear strain function. An eight noded serendipity element with 56 degrees of freedom is used to discretize the plate. Influences of lamination sequence (cross ply and angle ply), span to thickness ratio, and boundary conditions are investigated for the flexural behavior of laminated composite and sandwich plates. Further, the stability behavior of plates subjected to in-plane loads (uni-axial and bi-axial) is investigated for a variety of examples. Effects of boundary conditions on the critical buckling loads and their mode shapes are also assessed for a class of laminates in order to show the efficacy of the present mathematical technique to predict the buckling mode shapes. The results are compared with exact solution and other mathematical treatments and validity and efficacy of the present formulation and methodology is made certain.In order to consider the improved structural kinematics in terms of inverse hyperbolic shear strain function and propose the methodology for a general laminated plate, we consider a multilayered plate with dimensions (a×b×h) in the Cartesian co-ordinates x–y–z as shown inFig. 1.Recently developed inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory by the authors [44] is chosen as the displacement field for the structural kinematics of the laminated plate. The in-plane displacement components (u, v) possess the through-thickness variation while the transverse displacement (w) is assumed to be constant over the thickness (h) of the plate as follows:(1)u(x,y,z)=u0(x,y)−z∂w0∂x+(sinh−1(rzh)−z2rhr2+4)θx(x,y)v(x,y,z)=v0(x,y)−z∂w0∂y+(sinh−1(rzh)−z2rhr2+4)θy(x,y)w(x,y,z)=w0(x,y)The above displacement field assumes the non-linear distribution of transverse shear stresses across the thickness and also satisfies the condition of zero transverse shear on the top and bottom surfaces of the plate. The mid plane (z=0) displacement components are expressed as u0, v0, and w0 while θxand θyare the shear deformations. The parameter r is the shape parameter whose value is ascertained as 3.0 by the inverse method in the post processing step [44]. The essential continuity requirement of the finite element applicable to the above displacement field is C1 continuity; however difficulties associated with C1 continuous finite element make the computational process quite expensive. Therefore, in order to reduce the continuity requirement to C0, first order derivatives of the transverse displacement appearing in the in-plane displacement terms are considered as separate independent degrees of freedom. Thus, the displacement field is modified by introducing the additional degrees of freedom φx=w,xand φy=w,y, so as to ensure the C0 continuity requirement and given in Eq. (2).(2)u(x,y,z)=u0(x,y)−zϕx(x,y)+[g(z)+Ωz]θx(x,y)v(x,y,z)=v0(x,y)−zϕy(x,y)+[g(z)+Ωz]θy(x,y)w(x,y,z)=w0(x,y)where g(z)=sinh−1(rz/h) and Ω=−2r/(h(r2+4)1/2). The representation of inverse hyperbolic shear strain function in terms of g(z) and Ω generalizes the present formulation and ensures the implementation of other shear strain functions developed in Refs. [14–19]. The artificial constraints arising due to introduction of the additional degrees of freedom are imposed variationally incorporating the following constraint equations in total potential energy of the system.(2a)∂w0/∂x−ϕx=0;∂w0/∂y−ϕy=0The strain displacement relations under the assumption of small displacements but moderate rotations are expressed as von-Karman non-linear relations.{ε}5×1={εL}+{εNL}(3){ε}5×1=[εxxεyyγxyγyzγzx]T{εL}=[u,xv,yu,yv,xv,z+w,yu,z+w,x]T{εNL}=[12(w,x)212(w,y)212(w,x)(w,y)00]TThe linear part of strain–displacement relations contribute towards the elastic stiffness while for formulating geometric stiffness, non-linear part is employed.The stress–strain relation of a kth orthotropic layer having fiber orientation, α with respect to structural co-ordinate system (x–y–z) are expressed as(4){σ}5×1=[Q¯ij](k){ε}5×1where the transformed reduced stiffness matrix,[Q¯ij](k)is obtained in terms of material properties (E1, E2, G12, G23, G13, and ν12) and fiber orientation (α) of kth layer.An eight noded iso-parametric serendipity biquadratic quadrilateral element is used to discretize the plate geometry. An element with seven degrees of freedom per node is considered to ensure the continuity requirement. The shape functions at node i for an eight noded serendipity element are as follows:(5)Ni={14(1+ξξi)(1+ηηi)(ξξi+ηηi−1)fori=1,2,3,412(1−ξ2)(1+ηηi)fori=5,712(1−η2)(1+ξξi)fori=6,8Consequently, the element geometry and field variables can be expressed in terms of shape functions as follows:(6)ς=∑i=18Niςiandq=∑i=18Niqiwhere ς is the generalized geometrical co-ordinate, ςiis the value of corresponding coordinate at node i and q is the generalized field variable with qias the value of field variable at node i.The linear strains as expressed in Eq. (3) are implemented in order to formulate the element stiffness matrix and hence the strain energy due to linear strains. The components of linear strains are written in terms of generalized strains which are functions of generalized degrees of freedom.(7){εL}5x1=[H]5x13{ε¯l}13x1where{ε¯l}13x1={ε10ε20ε60k10k20k60k11k21k61ε40ε50k42k52}TThe Matrix [H] and components of generalized strains are given in Appendix A.Further the generalized strains{ε¯}can be expressed in terms of field variables, {q} as follows:(8){ε¯l}13×1=[L]13×7{qi}7×1where{qi}7×1=[u0v0w0θxθyϕxϕy]TThe elemental strain–displacement relations for jth element can now be obtained by making use of Eq.

Non-linear strain–displacement relations are employed to formulate elemental geometric stiffness matrix and hence strain energy due to nonlinear strains. The derivation procedure of strain energy due to nonlinear strains is similar to that of strain energy due to linear strains. The strain energy of j-th element due to nonlinear strains is as(12)Unl(j)=12∫v{εnl}jT{σ}jdv=12∫v{εnl}jT[S]{εnl}jdv=12∫v{ε¯nl}jT[Hg]jT[S][Hg]j{ε¯nl}jdv=12∫s{q¯}jT[BG]jT[G]j[BG]j{q¯}jdxdy=12{q¯}jT[KG]j{q¯}jwhere[G]=∑k=1nl∫zlzu[HG]T[S][HG]dz;S=[SxxSxySxySyy]The in-plane stresses, Sxyand Syyare expressed in terms of Sxxas Syy=λ1Sxxand Sxy=λ2SxxPerforming the assembly over all the elements in the domain gives the total strain energy due to nonlinear strains in terms of global geometric stiffness matrix, [KG] as follows:(13)Unl=∑j=1nelUnl(j)=12{q}T[KG]{q}The strain energy, arising due to imposition of artificial constraints as indicated in Eq.

For uniformly distributed load (UDL), p0=q0 whilep0=q0sin(πx/a)sin(πy/b)for sinusoidal load (SSL).Lagrange equation for the conservative system incorporating the essential terms related to flexural and stability behavior of laminated composite and sandwich plates is given in Eq. (17) and the same is implemented to obtain the governing equations for the analyses.(17)∂Ul∂{qi}+λ∂Unl∂{qi}+∂∂{qi}[γ2∫V((∂w0∂x−ϕx)T(∂w0∂x−ϕx)+(∂w0∂y−ϕy)T(∂w0∂y−ϕy))dV]+∂W∂{qi}=0Implementing Eqs. (11) and (13)–(16) in Eq. (17), we obtain the following algebraic equation:(18)[K+γKC]{q}+λ[KG]{q}={F}The plate is assumed to be under the effect of transverse loads only. The governing equations for the flexural analysis under the condition of static equilibrium are as(19)[K+γKc]{q}={F}The above system of equations is solved to get the nodal displacements after applying the necessary boundary conditions. Further, the corresponding stresses are evaluated implementing the linear strains of Eq. (3) in Eq. (4). Since the stresses are derived quantities in IHSDT (a displacement based approach), special attention is required to evaluate the accurate nodal stresses.The laminated plate is subjected to in-plane loads only and the in-plane stresses may induce instability in the plate which is expressed mathematically as an eigenvalue problem given in Eq. (20).(20)[K+γKC]{q}+λ[KG]{q}=0The objective of the eigenvalue problem is to evaluate critical values of λ which make the stiffness matrix singular thereby inducing instability in the plate. Critical buckling loads correspond to the eigenvalues of Eq. (20) while the eigenvectors, q are associated with the corresponding mode shapes.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The applicability of inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory for the analysis of general laminates is ascertained by presenting a generalized finite element formulation and methodology. The introduction of C0 finite element by considering additional degrees of freedom in the displacement field reduces the requirement of implementing C1 continuous element which is comparatively more computationally expensive and hence making the solution methodology efficient and applicable to more complicated/practical problems. The present methodology is assessed for numerous examples on flexural and stability behavior of laminated composite and sandwich plates and its validity is made certain. Influences of various parameters such as span-thickness ratio, boundary conditions, loading conditions are investigated for the analysis of laminated composite and sandwich plates. Higher buckling modes are obtained and effects of boundary conditions, biaxial load and in-plane shear load on the mode shapes are observed. The inverse hyperbolic function is represented in such a way that it generalizes the finite element formulation and hence ensures its implementation to all existing shear deformation theories involving shear strain function, which is a remarkable advantage providing the facility to use various theories for the analysis of laminated composite and sandwich plates.[H]=[100z00g(z)0000000100z00g(z)0000000100z00g(z)000000000000010g'(z)0000000000010g'(z)]ε10=∂u0∂x;ε20=∂v0∂y;ε60=∂u0∂y+∂v0∂x;ε40=∂w0∂y−ϕy;ε50=∂w0∂x−ϕx;k10=Ω∂θx∂x−∂ϕx∂x;k20=Ω∂θy∂y−∂ϕy∂y;k60=Ω(∂θx∂y+∂θy∂x)−(∂ϕx∂y+∂ϕy∂x);k11=∂θx∂x;k21=∂θy∂y;k61=(∂θx∂y+∂θy∂x);k42=θy;k52=θx
