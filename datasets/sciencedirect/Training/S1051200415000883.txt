@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This work proposes a new method of extracting texture descriptors from digital images based on local scaling properties of the greyscale function using constraints to define connected local sets. The texture is first mapped onto a three-dimensional cloud of points and the local coarseness under different scales is assigned to each point p. This measure is obtained from the size of the largest “connected” set of points within a cube centred at p. Here, the “connected set” is defined as the set of points such that for each point in the local domain there is at least one other point at a distance smaller than a threshold t. Finally, the Bouligand–Minkowski fractal descriptors of the local coarseness of each pixel are computed. The classificatory power of the descriptors on the Brodatz, Vistex, UIUC and UMD databases showed an improvement over the results obtained with other well-known texture descriptors reported in the literature. The performance achieved also suggests possible applications to real-world problems where the images are best analysed as textures.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
There have been several fractal-based methods proposed for the analysis of complexity in images, including the analysis of image textures [1–7]. Fractal geometry in image analysis has also found practical applications in a number of areas [8–10,44,11–14].In a “texture image”, the analysis is typically focused on the statistical and geometrical relations amongst pixel intensity patterns in different regions and scales. In this context, fractal analysis becomes a powerful tool to address the problem of measuring the complexity or the homogeneity of the texture across scales. A pattern can be expressed by certain type of homogeneity at a particular resolution and here is where fractal geometry provides a straightforward procedure to detect and relate such properties. Moreover, real world objects commonly have some degrees of intrinsic self-similarity and therefore they might be more suitably represented as approximations to fractal objects rather than to regular Euclidean ones. Some of the successful fractal-based approaches tested in this field include “multiscale fractal dimension” [15], multifractals [16] and “fractal descriptors” [17]. Particularly, the latter has demonstrated to be highly efficient for the discrimination of general textures [18–20,13,14,21].Here, we propose an alternative way of extracting texture descriptors based on fractal geometry. The texture descriptors are computed using the Bouligand–Minkowski fractal descriptors [20] based on the local coarseness of each pixel [22,23] rather than on the image intensity values [20,17,19]. The proposed procedure performs a two-level complexity analysis. In the local domain, the coarseness describes the clustering (or homogeneity) of the pixel neighbourhood, while globally, the fractal descriptors represent the distribution of connectivities across the image. These two complementary types of information appear to be fundamental in describing and discriminating texture patterns at varying scales in a more straightforward way than other statistical or geometrical solutions proposed. Some advantages of the suggested approach are:•A large number of real-world scenes (like those described by the textures analysed here) have fractal-like characteristics;The “fractal properties” of textures are most often not homogeneous across scales as expected with ideal fractal objects but the fractal descriptors enable the quantification of such variability across the image;The local coarseness provides information about pixel neighbourhoods, which is rather richer than pixel intensity alone.The method performance was assessed on four well-known image databases (Brodatz [24], Vistex [25], UIUC [33] and UMD [16]) and the results were compared to other texture descriptors reported in the literature (Gabor [26], Fourier [27], Grey-Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) [28], Multifractal [16], Local Binary Patterns (LBP) [29], Soft-LBP [35], Fuzzy-LBP [36] and textons (VZ) [34]).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We proposed a new method to extract texture descriptors from grey-level images by computing the Bouligand–Minkowski fractal descriptors from a matrix containing the coarseness Holder exponent (logarithm of the number of points connected to each pixel in the original image).The method was applied to classify well-known databases and the performance compared to other classical and state-of-the-art texture analyses published in the literature. Our method outperformed all other analyses for the compared databases.The results suggest that fractal descriptors and local coarseness exponent provide complementary information about the textures. While the coarseness index measures pixel clustering and consequently the neighbourhood homogeneity, the fractal descriptors provide a measure of the regularity of the distribution of Holder exponents, and consequently the distribution of patterns along scales. After removal of redundancies through PCA, the descriptors become a powerful tool to represent and describe complex textures.
