For linear time invariant transforms, the multiplications in these transformed domains are referred to as filtering. On the other hand, the multiplications in linear time varying transformed domains are referred to as mask operations. Discrete fractional Fourier transforms (DFrFTs) are linear time varying transforms which map signals from the time domain to the rotated time frequency domains. In this paper, effects of the rotational angles of the DFrFTs on the output signals after applying the mask operations are studied. It is proved in this paper that if the rotational angles of the DFrFTs are not integer multiples ofπ, as well as they are not odd integer multiples ofπ2when the signal lengths are odd, then there is only one degree of freedom for designing the mask coefficients. Otherwise, there are N degrees of freedom for designing the mask coefficients. Moreover, it is proved in this paper that satisfying the conditions for obtaining real valued output signals will automatically satisfy the conditions for obtaining wide sense stationary (WSS) output signals. Based on this result, designs of the mask coefficients are formulated as optimization problems withL1norm nonconvex objective functions only subject to the conditions for obtaining real valued output signals. These constrained optimization problems are further reformulated to unconstrained optimization problems by a vector space approach. Finally, when there is only one degree of freedom for designing the mask coefficients, the globally optimal solutions of the unconstrained optimization problems are derived analytically. Computer numerical simulation results are presented for illustrations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Whitening [1] is a process for decorrelating WSS signals. After whitening the signals, if the probability density functions of the output signals at different time instants are the same, then the output signals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) [2]. Since theories for processing i.i.d. signals are well established, many existing algorithms can then be directly applied [2].DFrFTs [3–12] are the generalization of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) [13–18]. When the rotational angles of the DFrFTs are odd integer multiples ofπ2, the DFrFTs become the conventional DFT or inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT). When the rotational angles of the DFrFTs are integer multiples ofπ, the operations are performed in the time domain. Since there is an extra degree of freedom for choosing the rotational angle of the DFrFT, it is worth to investigate whether there exist rotational angles other than integer multiples ofπor odd integer multiples ofπ2such that better whitening performances can be achieved. If the answer of this question is positive, then it will be useful to perform the whitening in the optimal DFrFT domain. This paper is to answer this fundamental question analytically.To perform whitening via mask operations in transformed domains, signals before whitening are assumed to be real valued and WSS [1]. The signals are first represented in transform domains [19–21]. Then, mask operations are performed in the transformed domains [19–21]. Finally, the output signals are represented in the time domain [19–21]. The most common method for performing whitening is via filtering in the frequency domain [1], in which it is a linear and time invariant operation. However, if there exist singularities in the power spectral densities of the signals, then the singularities still exist in the power spectral densities of the output signals. For this case, perfect whitening cannot be performed in the frequency domain because the power spectral densities of the output signals are not constant functions. To tackle this problem, time varying whitening approaches [22] have been proposed. However, these time varying [29] whitening approaches are not only involved simple matrix multiplications [22], but also other complicated operations which require very heavy computational powers. Hence, these time varying approaches cannot be applied to realtime applications. As whitening in the DFrFT domains only involves simple matrix multiplications [3–12], the required computational powers are very low [23,24]. Hence, it is worth to investigate whether perfect whitening can be performed in the DFrFT domains or not when there are singularities in the power spectral densities of the signals. This paper also answers this fundamental question analytically.For many practical applications, such as image and video denoising [25], signal separation [26] and signal sampling [27,28], signals are real valued and WSS. It is important to guarantee that the output signals are also real valued and WSS. Hence, this paper investigates the conditions on the rotational angles of the DFrFTs and the mask coefficients for obtaining nearly white real valued WSS output signals. In fact, this investigation has not been studied yet. Since DFrFTs are complex valued [3–12], in general it is not guaranteed that the output signals are real valued for any real valued signal. Moreover, as performing whitening in the DFrFT domains involves matrix multiplications [3–12], the output signals at particular time instants are the weighted sums of the signals at all time instants. Hence, it is also not guaranteed that the output signals are WSS. Deriving the conditions for obtaining both real valued and WSS output signals is one of the major contributions of this paper. Furthermore, as the DFrFTs are time varying [29], principles for performing whitening in the frequency domain based on its linear time invariant properties [1] are not applied to that in the DFrFT domains. Developing a principle for performing whitening in the DFrFT domains is another major contribution of this paper.The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 and Section 3 derive the conditions for obtaining real valued and WSS output signals in the DFrFT domains, respectively. Section 4 formulates a design of the mask coefficients as anL1norm nonconvex optimization problem. When the rotational angles of the DFrFTs are not integer multiples ofπ, as well as they are not odd integer multiples ofπ2when the signal lengths are odd, the solutions of these optimization problems are derived analytically. Computer numerical simulation results are presented in Section 5. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future works are suggested in Section 6.Denotex(n)forn=0,…,N−1as an N point signal. Letx≡[x(0)⋯x(N−1)]T,where the superscript “T” denotes the transpose operator. Denoteℜa×bandCa×bas the sets ofa×breal valued matrices anda×bcomplex valued matrices, respectively,Fθ∈CN×Nas a DFrFT matrix with the rotational angleθ∈[−π,π),l≡[l0⋯lN−1]T∈CN×1as a vector of the mask coefficients, andy(n)forn=0,…,N−1as the output signal andy≡[y(0)⋯y(N−1)]T.There are many different definitions of DFrFTs [3,6,31] and employing different definitions of DFrFTs will result to different transformed signals. However, the following results are valid for all the DFrFTs that can be expressed in the following form:Fθ=Ediag(e−jθβ)ET,where E is a real valued unitary matrix anddiag(z)denotes the diagonal matrix with its diagonal elements being the elements of z. That is,EET=ETE=IN,whereINdenotes theN×Nidentity matrix. Here,ejθβ≡[ejθβ0⋮ejθβN−1],whereβnforn=0,…,N−1are independent of θ. Two different realizations of the DFrFTs based on the discussions in [3] and [6] are implemented. These two different realizations associate with different matrices E. For the realization of the DFrFT discussed in [6], letunforn=1,…,Nbe the columns of E. Then, E can be obtained by the following procedures.Step 1: Define S and P as follow:S≡[−210⋯0112cos(2πN)1⋯00012cos(4πN)⋯00⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮100⋯12cos(2π(N−1)N)]andP≡12[200⋯00010⋯01001⋯10⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮001⋯−10010⋯0−1].Step 2: Define Ev and Od as follow:[Ev0N2×N20N2×N2Od]≡PSP−1,where0a×bdenotes thea×bzero matrix.Step 3: Find the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of Ev and Od.Step 4: Sort the eigenvectors of Ev and Od individually according to the descending order of the corresponding individual eigenvalues. Denote the sorted eigenvectors asekandok, respectively.Step 5: Setu2k≡P[ekT0⋯0]Tandu2k+1≡P[0⋯0okT]T.Hence, we obtainE≡[u1⋯uN].For the further details, please refer to Table IV in [6]. For the realization of the DFrFT discussed in [3], first the Hermite–Gaussian functions are employed as the homogeneous solutions of a second order differential equation. Then, the second order differential equation is approximated by an infinite order difference equation. Define W as the N point centered discrete Fourier transform matrix,V1≡2(real(W)+(real(W))2),V2≡−2(real(W)−(real(W))2),V3≡2(imag(W)+(imag(W))2)andV4≡−2(imag(W)−(imag(W))2).Here,real(z)andimag(z)denote the real part and the imaginary part of z, respectively. It is proved in [3] that by computing the reduced echelon form ofVifori=1,2,3,4, employing the Gauss–Jordan elimination method for finding the pivots, picking only the columns associated with the pivots and employing an orthogonalization algorithm, we have the normalized linearly independent orthonormal eigenvectors. These orthonormal eigenvectors can be employed as the columns of E. Once the transform is defined, the output signal can be obtained byy≡F−θdiag(l)Fθx.As many practical applications [25–28] require real valued output signals, it is important to derive the conditions for obtaining real valued output signals for any real valued signal. To address this problem, let the(m+1)th row and the(n+1)th column ofF2θbeum,n,2θ. That is:F2θ≡[u0,0,2θ⋯u0,N−1,2θ⋮⋱⋮uN−1,0,2θ⋯uN−1,N−1,2θ].DefineU2θL≡[u0,0,2θ0⋯0⋮⋮⋱⋮u0,N−1,2θ0⋯0⋱⋱0⋯0uN−1,0,2θ⋮⋱⋮⋮0⋯0uN−1,N−1,2θ]∈CN2×N,U2θR≡[diag([u0,0,2θ⋯u0,N−1,2θ]T)⋮diag([uN−1,0,2θ⋯uN−1,N−1,2θ]T)]∈CN2×N,U2θ≡[real(U2θL)−real(U2θR)−imag(U2θL)−imag(U2θR)imag(U2θL)−imag(U2θR)real(U2θL)+real(U2θR)]andl¯≡[real(l)imag(l)].Here, the column vector containing the(pN+1)th row to the(p+1)Nth row and the(q+1)th column ofU2θLforp=0,…,N−1and forq=0,…,N−1is the transpose of the(p+1)th row ofF2θ. Also, the column vector containing the diagonal elements from the(pN+1)th row to the(p+1)Nth row ofU2θRforp=0,…,N−1is the transpose of the(p+1)th row ofF2θ. Although the DFrFT is complex valued and time varying, the mask operation performed in the DFrFT domain is linear with respect to the mask coefficients. Hence, both the real part and imaginary part of the output signal are linearly related to the vector containing both the real part and the imaginary part of the mask coefficients. As a result, the necessary and sufficient condition for obtaining the real valued output signal for any real valued signal is governed by linear relationships among the elements in the vector containing both the real part and the imaginary part of the mask coefficients. Therefore, we have the following theorem:Theorem 1∀x∈ℜN×1, the output signaly∈ℜN×1if and only ifU2θl¯=02N2×1.The proof is shown in Appendix A. From Theorem 1, we can see that the condition for obtaining real valued output signals for any real valued signal is governed by the linear matrix equationU2θl¯=02N2×1.Denoterank(Z)as the total number of independent rows or the total number of independent columns of Z,N(Z)as the null space of Z and ∅ as the empty set. SinceN⩾1,we have2N⩽2N2.AsU2θ∈ℜ2N2×2N, the existence of nonzero solutions ofU2θl¯=02N2×1is equivalent toN(U2θ)≠{02N×1}andN(U2θ)≠∅,orrank(U2θ)<2N.On the other hand, since there are2N2rows and 2N columns inU2θ, in generalN(U2θ)≠{02N×1}andN(U2θ)≠∅,orrank(U2θ)<2Nmay not be satisfied. The following theorem guarantees thatrank(U2θ)<2Nis satisfied.Theorem 2rank(U2θ)⩽2N−1.The proof is shown in Appendix B. From Theorem 2, we know that there exists a nonzero solution such thatU2θl¯=02N2×1.This further implies that there exists at least one nonzero mask vector such that the output signals are real valued for any real valued signal.However, Theorem 2 does not tell us the exact total number of the degrees of freedom for designing the mask vectors. The following theorem addresses this issue.Theorem 3Denote Z as the set of integers. Letk∈Z. If(1)θ≠kπ2,orθ=(2k+1)π2andNis an even number,thenrank(U2θ)=2N−1.The proof is shown in Appendix C. Assume that (1) is satisfied. Theorem 3 implies thatdim(l¯)=1.Here,dim(z)denotes the total number of the degrees of freedom of z.Letι≡[1N×10N×1],where1a×bdenotes thea×bmatrix with all its elements being equal to one. From the proof of Theorem 2, it further implies thatl¯=αι,whereα∈ℜ. In other words, if (1) is satisfied, then there is only one degree of freedom for designing the mask vectors. Also,l¯=αιimplies that the real parts of all the mask coefficients are the same and their imaginary parts are zero. This further implies that performing the mask operations is equivalent to multiplying signals to real valued scalars. Hence, if there are singularities in the power spectral densities of the signals, then there will have the same singularities in the power spectral densities of the output signals. As a result, the perfect whitening still cannot be performed in the DFrFT domains with other rotational angles.The following corollary complements the case when (1) is not satisfied.Corollary 1Letk∈Z. If(2)θ=kπor(3)θ=(2k+1)π2andNis an odd number,thenrank(U2θ)=N.Moreover, by definingimag(l)=0N×1when(2)is satisfied, andlp=lN−p⁎forp=1,…,N−12when(3)is satisfied, we havel¯∈N(U2θ).The proof is shown in Appendix D. Corollary 1 refers to the following two cases: Case 1 or (3) refers to the conventional frequency domain filtering. The output signals are real valued for any real valued signal when the filter coefficients are conjugate symmetric and N is odd valued. Case 2 or (2) refers to the conventional time domain operation. The output signals are real valued for any real valued signal when the window coefficients are real valued.However, if (1) is satisfied, we can see from Theorem 3 that performing the mask operations are equivalent to multiplying signals to real valued scalars and there is only one degree of freedom for designing the mask vectors. Comparing to the case when either (2) or (3) is satisfied, there are N degrees of freedom for designing the mask vectors. If (2) is satisfied, we can design the N real valued window coefficients. If (3) is satisfied, we can design the N complex valued filter coefficients with N degrees of freedom subject to the conjugate symmetric property. Obviously, the total number of degrees of freedom for designing the mask vectors when (1) is satisfied is significantly lower than that when either (2) or (3) is satisfied. In other words, comparing the DFrFTs to the DFT, the DFrFTs have lower degrees of freedom for performing the whitening operations. This is a counter intuitive result because the DFT is a particular case of the DFrFTs.DenoteE(⋅)as the expectation operator. Assume thatx(n)is WSS, then there existsx¯such thatE(x(n))≡x¯.Denoterx(n)as the autocorrelation function ofx(n). Sincex(n)is an N point signal, its discrete time Fourier transform is a continuous2πperiodic function and these N DFT coefficients can be obtained via sampling the signal in the frequency domain. This is equivalent to periodizex(n)in the time domain and compute its discrete time Fourier series coefficients. Hence, we can assume thatrx(n)is periodic and symmetric with its period equal to N. That is:rx(n)={rx(N2−n)=rx(N2+n)forn=1,…,N2−1andNis even,rx(N−12−n)=rx(N+12+n)forn=0,…,N−12−1andNis odd.LetRx≡[rx(0)rx(1)⋯rx(N−1)rx(1)⋱⋱⋮⋮⋱⋱rx(1)rx(N−1)⋯rx(1)rx(0)],A≡x¯[∑q=0M−1(∑n=0N−1ejθne0,ne0,n)(∑n=0N−1e−jθneq,ne0,n)⋯∑q=0M−1(∑n=0N−1ejθne0,neN−1,n)(∑n=0N−1e−jθneq,neN−1,n)⋮⋱⋮∑q=0M−1(∑n=0N−1ejθneN−1,ne0,n)(∑n=0N−1e−jθneq,ne0,n)⋯∑q=0M−1(∑n=0N−1ejθneN−1,neN−1,n)(∑n=0N−1e−jθneq,neN−1,n)],A¯≡[real(A)−imag(A)imag(A)real(A)],Qm≡[(∑n=0N−1ejθnem,ne0,n)(∑n=0N−1e−jθne0,ne0,n)⋯(∑n=0N−1ejθnem,neN−1,n)(∑n=0N−1e−jθne0,neN−1,n)⋮⋱⋮(∑n=0N−1ejθnem,ne0,n)(∑n=0N−1e−jθneN−1,ne0,n)⋯(∑n=0N−1ejθnem,neN−1,n)(∑n=0N−1e−jθneN−1,neN−1,n)]form=0,…,N−1,Qm,tR≡[real(QmTRxQt)−imag(QmTRxQt)−imag(QmTRxQt)−real(QmTRxQt)]form=0,…,N−1and fort=0,…,N−1,andQm,tI≡[imag(QmTRxQt)real(QmTRxQt)real(QmTRxQt)−imag(QmTRxQt)]form=0,…,N−1and fort=0,…,N−1.Since WSS is a fundamental property required for many applications [25–28], it is important to characterize the condition for obtaining WSS output signals for any WSS signals. The condition is summarized in the following theorem.Theorem 4If∃y¯∈ℜ1×1such that(4)Al¯=y¯ι,and∃ry(n)∈ℜ[n]such that(5)l¯TQm,tRl¯=ry(|m−t|)⩾0form=0,…,N−1and fort=0,…,N−1,and(6)l¯TQm,tIl¯=0form=0,…,N−1and fort=0,…,N−1,theny(n)is WSS.The proof is shown in Appendix E. DefineSθas the set of solutions satisfying (4)–(6). That isSθ≡{l¯:(4)–(6) are satisfied}.From Theorem 4, we can see that ify(n)is WSS, then we have to satisfy 2N linear equations defined in (4),N2−Nquadratic equations defined in (5), N quadratic inequalities defined in (5), andN2quadratic equations defined in (6). However, there is only one degree of freedom for designingl¯if (1) is satisfied. In general,Sθcould be empty. To address this problem, we have the following theorem:Theorem 5Assume thatx(n)is real valued and WSS. Ify(n)is real valued, theny(n)is also WSS.The proof is shown in Appendix F. In general, the conditions for obtaining real valued output signals are independent to those for obtaining WSS output signals. This is because they are two different properties. However, Theorem 5 implies that these two different conditions are dependent if the signals are real valued and WSS. This is also an interesting result. Theorem 5 states that the conditions for obtaining real valued output signals imply the conditions for obtaining WSS output signals for any real valued WSS signal.From Theorem 4, we know that it is required to satisfy the 2N linear equations defined in (4), theN2−Nquadratic equations defined in (5), N quadratic inequalities defined in (5), andN2quadratic equations defined in (6) in order to obtain WSS output signals. This set of solutions is highly nonconvex. Hence, the optimal designs of the mask coefficients are highly nonconvex problems and it is very difficult to find the globally optimal solutions [30]. However, according to Theorem 5, we only need to satisfy the linear equations defined byU2θl¯=02N2×1,in which the corresponding feasible sets are convex. Moreover, this kind of linear equality constrained optimization problems can be further reformulated to unconstrained optimization problems via a vector space approach discussed in the next section. As a result, the globally optimal solutions can be derived analytically.For perfect whitening, we havelTQmTRxQtl=δ(m−t)form=0,…,N−1and fort=0,…,N−1.However, this condition is too tight. Solutions may not be existed for many practical applications [25–28] particularly when there are singularities in the power spectral densities of the signals. Hence, perfect whitening is usually relaxed to nearly whitening with minimizing the following objective function1N2−N∑m=0N−1∑t=0t≠mN−1l¯TQm,tRl¯+1N∑m=0N−1|l¯TQm,mRl¯−1|,where|⋅|denotes the absolute operator. By Theorem 5, designs of the mask coefficients can be formulated as the followingL1norm nonconvex optimization problems for any real valued WSS signal:Problem(P)minl¯1N2−N∑m=0N−1∑t=0t≠mN−1l¯TQm,tRl¯+1N∑m=0N−1|l¯TQm,mRl¯−1|,subject toU2θl¯=02N2×1.LetVθbe a matrix in which its columns span the null space ofU2θ. Since∀l¯∈N(U2θ), there exists a coefficient vectorξsuch thatl¯=Vθξ.LetQ¯θ≡1N2−N∑m=0N−1∑t=0t≠mN−1VθTQm,tRVθ.As the output signals are WSS,Qm,mRform=0,…,N−1is independent of m. LetQˆθ≡VθTQm,mRVθ.Then, Problem(P)is equivalent to the following unconstrained optimization problem:Problem(P¯)minξξTQ¯θξ+|ξTQˆθξ−1|.It is worth noting that Problem(P¯)is still nonsmooth and nonconvex. Conventional gradient descent approaches are not applied for finding a locally optimal solution of the optimization problem. Even though a locally optimal solution is found, in general it is very difficult to guarantee that the obtained solution is the globally optimal solution. However, if (1) is satisfied, then Problem(P¯)becomes a one dimensional unconstrained optimization problem. In this case,Q¯θ,Qˆθandξare all scalars. (5) implies that bothQ¯θ>0andQˆθ>0.Hence, we have:ξTQ¯θξ+|ξTQˆθξ−1|={ξT(Q¯θ+Qˆθ)ξ−1ξ⩾1Qˆθorξ⩽−1Qˆθ,ξT(Q¯θ−Qˆθ)ξ+1−1Qˆθ<ξ<1Qˆθ.Denoteξ⁎as the globally nonzero optimal solution of Problem(P¯). Then, obviously, we haveξ⁎=1Qˆθorξ⁎=−1Qˆθ.If (1) is not satisfied, then the problem becomes a conventional whitening problem, in which many existing results can be applied for solving the problem [1].It is worth noting that too short signal lengths will introduce the boundary effects due to the periodization of the signals. On the other hand, too long signal lengths require very heavy computational powers [23,24]. For this case, the signals are usually segmented into pieces of sub-signals so that the total computational powers required are affordable based on the given hardware resources. In this paper,N=7andN=11are selected to illustrate the tradeoff between the computational power required and the boundary effect. In this paper, an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E3-1225 V2 CPU operating at 3.2 GHz with a 16 GB memory is employed for the computer numerical simulations. The algorithm is executed using the Matlab Version 7.11.0.584 (R2010b) operating under the 64 bit Microsoft Windows 7 Version 6.1 with Service Pack 1 and Java 1.6.0_17-b04.In order to illustrate the validity of the results, two periodic and symmetric functions are employed for the demonstration. The first periodic and symmetric function employed isrx(n)={1−n40⩽n⩽N−121−N4+n4N+12⩽n⩽N−1forn=0,…,N−1because this function is the most widely common periodic and symmetric function employed in the signal processing community. The second function employed is random. The firstN+12elements ofrx(n)are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The followingN−12elements ofrx(n)are the flip version of the second element to the(N+12)th element ofrx(n). It is obviously that this function is periodic and symmetric.Since N is odd valued, there are N degrees of freedom for designing the mask coefficients if θ are selected as odd integer multiples ofπ2or integer multiples ofπ. Compared to other values of θ, the degrees of freedom for designing the mask coefficients is higher. As a result, better whitening performances can be achieved. Fig. 1and Fig. 2plot the objective functional values of Problem(P¯)for the full range of θ and a wide range ofξforN=7andN=11withrx(n)={1−n40⩽n⩽N−12,1−N4+n4N+12⩽n⩽N−1,respectively. It can be seen from both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 that the objective functions are nonsmooth and nonconvex. The global minima shown in both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are perfectly agreed with the analytical solutions derived in Section 4. It can also be seen from both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 that the objective functional values of the optimization problems when θ are evaluated at odd integer multiples ofπ2or integer multiples ofπare much lower than those evaluated at other values. This implies that the conventional frequency domain filtering and the time domain windowing achieve better whitening performances compared to the cases when the mask operations are performed in the DFrFT domains with other rotational angles. For the computational powers required, the computer numerical simulation times forN=7andN=11are 0.21 s and 0.51 s, respectively, which are fast enough for most real time applications such as video denoising applications. Fig. 3and Fig. 4plot the objective functional values of Problem(P¯)for the full range ofθand a wide range ofξforN=7andN=11with the above described periodic and symmetric random functionrx(n), respectively. The computational powers required for the computer numerical simulation times forN=7andN=11are 0.25 s and 0.59 s, respectively. We can see that both periodic and symmetric functions exhibit similar behaviors. This demonstrates the validity of the derived results.This paper investigated the number of degrees of freedom for performing the mask operations in the DFrFT domains for obtaining nearly white real valued WSS output signals via a joint vector space andL1norm optimization approach. First, we proved that the conditions for obtaining real valued output signals for any real valued signal are governed by linear matrix equations and the solutions that satisfy these equations are in the null space of the corresponding matrices. Second, we proved that the null spaces of the matrices are always nonempty. Hence, there always exist nonzero mask vectors that yield real valued output signals for any real valued signal. Third, when the rotational angles of the DFrFTs are not integer multiples ofπ, as well as they are not odd integer multiples ofπ2when the signal lengths are odd, we proved that the total number of degrees of freedom for designing the mask vectors is exactly equal to one. This implies that the whitening operations are equivalent to multiplying signals to real valued scalars. This further implies that if there are singularities in the power spectral densities of the signals, then there will have the same singularities in the power spectral densities of the output signals. As a result, the perfect whitening still cannot be performed in the DFrFT domains with other rotational angles. Next, we compared these results to the cases when the rotational angles of the DFrFTs are integer multiples ofπ, or they are odd integer multiples ofπ2when the signal lengths are odd. We proved that these cases have N degrees of freedom for designing the mask coefficients. This implies that the conventional frequency domain filtering or the time domain windowing have more degrees of freedom for designing the mask coefficients. This is a counter intuitive result because the DFrFTs are the generalization of the DFT. Fourth, we proved that the conditions for obtaining real valued output signals imply the conditions for obtaining WSS output signals when the signals are real valued and WSS. This is also an interesting result because they are two different properties. Fifth, designs of the mask coefficients were formulated asL1norm nonconvex optimization problems. These optimization problems were further reformulated to unconstrained optimization problems. Finally, when the rotational angles of the DFrFTs are not integer multiples ofπ, as well as they are not odd integer multiples ofπ2when the signal lengths are odd, the globally optimal solutions of the unconstrained optimization problems were derived analytically.Although the perfect whitening cannot be performed in DFrFT domains if there are singularities in the power spectral densities of the signals, and the degrees of freedom for designing the mask coefficients in DFrFT domains are less than those in the time domain and the frequency domain, the real valued and the WSS conditions of the output signals have been imposed. We will investigate the feasibilities of achieving the perfect whitening in DFrFT domains if there are singularities in the power spectral densities of the signals as well as having higher degrees of freedom for designing the mask coefficients when these two conditions are relaxed.
