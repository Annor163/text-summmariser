@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this study, we propose a novel solution for collecting smart meter data by merging Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANET) and smart grid communication technologies. In our proposed mechanism, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks are utilized for collecting data from smart meters, eliminating the need for manpower. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study proposing the utilization of public transportation vehicles for collecting data from smart meters. With this work, the use of the IEEE 802.11p protocol has been proposed for the first time for use in smart grid applications. In our scheme, data flows first from smart meters to a bus through infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication and then from the bus to a bus stop through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. The performance of our proposed mechanism has been investigated in detail in terms of end-to-end delay and delivery ratio by using Network Simulator-2 and with different routing protocols.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the advances in wireless communication technology, it has been used in many areas, including environmental monitoring, health-related, home, industrial, military and surveillance applications, smart grid and vehicular communications [1]. Wireless communication helps reduce wired installation costs for many applications. The collaborative nature and low-cost features of wireless communication help its widespread adoption in different areas.The smart grid technology is a new concept for the next generation electric power system and it is the modernized version of the traditional power grid of the 20th century [2–4]. The smart grid technology enables real-time monitoring, protection and self-healing for grid elements. Furthermore, it permits two-way communication for the flow of both electricity and information. One of the vital components of a smart grid system is the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) technology [2], [5,6]. Smart meters enable two way communications between utilities and consumers using the AMI technology. With the help of the AMI technology, utilities can collect timely data on energy consumption, power quality and load profiles of their customers. In addition, utilities do not need to hire staff to manually collect consumption data from meters since smart meters automatically transmit this data to the utility center. With the AMI technology, customers can be informed on how much power they used and notified about critical periods of peak pricing. The existing applications of smart grids include automatic metering, demand response, distribution automation, fault diagnostics, load control and power fraud detection [4], [7].Vehicular communication is the vital technology in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for improving road safety and comfort [8]. Recently, it has been reported as one of the most important technologies used in vehicles [9]. The vehicular communication technology is also known as Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) which is an extension of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) to vehicles. VANETs have special features compared to MANETs, including high and predictable mobility, large scale usage, partitioned networks and variable topology [10]. In VANETs there are two types of communication which are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). The first one represents the communication between vehicles and the second one between vehicles and Road-Side Units (RSUs). The Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) or IEEE 802.11p communication protocols are the communication protocols used in research and development studies for VANETs [11]. The IEEE 802.11p protocol is an extension of the existing widely used IEEE 802.11 protocol with some amendments on MAC and physical layer for VANETs. It is based on the Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique on the physical layer. IEEE 802.11p has 6–27 Mbps data rate with 10 MHz bandwidth and 1000 m communication range [9], [12]. The existing applications of vehicular communication are weather-related information alerts, blind spot warning, do-not-pass warning at intersections, emergency vehicle warning, forward collision/accident warning and lane change warning [10], [12,13].In this paper, we first explored the existing mechanisms for collecting data from smart meters in a smart grid, and then proposed a new one which is based on VANETs. Our proposed mechanism is a novel solution for data collection from smart meters and includes public transportation buses. The main contributions of our study are listed below:•To the best of our knowledge, there is no published work which uses public transportation vehicles for collecting data from smart meters. This is the first study in this field.Our proposed mechanism only needs the IEEE 802.11p communication protocol capability on Wireless Automatic Meter Reading (WAMR) systems. This communication protocol may extend the communication range of smart meters up to 1000 m and it will be used for the first time in the literature for smart grid applications.Unlike other vehicular communication schemes, our study uses both I2V and V2I communication. Data first flows from smart meters to a bus, which is through I2V communication, and then from the bus to a bus stop, which is through V2I communication.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, an overview of the existing mechanisms for data collection from smart meters is presented. In Section 3, our proposed scheme is introduced. In Section 4, the system model is introduced. In Section 5, the performance evaluations of our proposed scheme are presented. Finally, Section 6 is the conclusion.
