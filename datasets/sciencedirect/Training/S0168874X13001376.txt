@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper is concerned with the development and application of high order full integrated tetrahedral finite elements to large deformable elastoplastic homogeneous solids. This strategy differs from usual ones adopted in literature that use low order and sub-integration methods to solve this kind of problems. The motivation is to find a more precise stress distribution inside solids that develops large strains in elastoplastic situations.In order to do so, two elastoplastic formulations are developed and implemented. The first, called hyperelastoplastic, is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, the intermediate configuration, and the elastic Mandel stress tensor, and it is devoted to large strain evolution. The second, called Green–Naghdi elastoplastic, is based on the additive decomposition of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor and the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor, and it is devoted to small strain and is used as a reference to the second development.In both cases, the three-dimensional von Mises yield criterion, the associative plastic flow rule and mixed hardening are used. Some structural problems have been numerically simulated, and convergence analysis is carried out. The results for the force versus displacement and the distributions of the plastic parameters are provided. The numerical results show that, as expected, the analysis error can be controlled by mesh refinement. The presented hyperelastoplastic formulation can model both finite elastic and finite plastic strains.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The main issue addressed here is the prediction of the mechanical behavior of elastoplastic homogeneous materials under finite strains and finite deformations, isothermal conditions and statically applied forces. The mechanical behavior prediction is an indispensable step for proper design of mechanical or structural components. There are many ways to perform this kind of prediction. However, it is well known that the computational – or numerical – methods are more general and more practicable when compared to the analytical and experimental methods. The most widespread numerical method applied to structural analysis is the Finite Element Method (FEM).Regarding numerical analysis of elastoplastic materials, two important applications are the sheet metal forming (see, for instance, [1–3]) and the modeling of bridge elastomeric bearings [4]. As pointed out by [5], the FEM analysis of sheet metal forming components has become an essential industrial tool. Two examples of materials often analyzed in elastoplastic regime can be mentioned: the metals, which usually present elastoplastic behavior with small elastic strains [6]; and the rubber-like materials, which can present softening behavior together with large elastic strains [7,8].With respect to the elastoplastic material model, some concepts from small strain analysis can be extended to the finite strain situation, such as: deformation measure decomposition, yield criterion, isotropic and kinematic hardening, consistency condition, return algorithm, and consistent tangent operator (for a good overview on these concepts, see [9–14]). In order to simplify the formulation when the material exhibits small strains, one may employ the additive decomposition of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor into the elastic and the plastic parts [11,15]. However, this decomposition is not valid for large strain applications (for further details, see [16]). A more suitable and well accepted kinematic approach in finite strains is the Kröner–Lee decomposition [17–19], in which the deformation gradient is multiplicatively decomposed into the elastic and the plastic parts. Regarding the constitutive modeling, one way to set the elastoplastic material response is to employ a thermodynamic formulation, i.e., a formulation based on the dissipation inequality. This kind of formulation when applied to finite strains is often called hyperelastoplastic model ([13,19–23]).It is well known that for 3D FEM applications (elastic or elastoplastic, developing or not large strains) low order elements with reduced integration techniques [24] and hourglass modes stabilization methods [25] are usually employed. This choice occurs due to the processing limitations when large meshes are required. In the context of low order tetrahedral elements, several improvements have been made in order to avoid locking problems (see, for instance, [26–29]). However, it is also well known that although the overall displacement results achieved employing these techniques are acceptable, the stress–strain fields are not well represented by the low order elements. When further studies depend upon residual stresses and strains, as for example the instability analysis of thin walled structures [30], the importance of the resulting stress–strain fields grows.To improve the stress–strain field prediction in FEM analysis of 3D large deformable elastoplastic homogeneous solids we propose to use a family of fully integrated high order tetrahedral finite elements [31] together with a position based finite element description for geometrical non-linear problems [32–34] associated with a parallel processing strategy [35].Therefore, the present study proposes a numerical strategy to simulate, via high order tetrahedral solid finite elements, elastoplastic homogeneous materials under statically applied forces, isothermal conditions, finite displacements and finite strains. In the context of this paper, as far as the authors know, there are no published studies regarding high order tetrahedral finite elements. Some examples of the present study compare low order and high order tetrahedral solid finite elements and show the convergence of results when meshes are refined.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the finite element kinematic approximation is briefly described, showing that the element order is freely chosen; moreover, positions are set as unknown parameters. Section 3 shows the hyperelastoplastic constitutive model formulation followed by the Green–Naghdi approximation. In Section 4 the equilibrium equation and the non-linear solving strategy is addressed. Section 5 shows the so called return algorithm that enables to numerically apply the developed elastoplastic models. Some computational aspects are highlighted in Section 6. Section 7 presents various examples to validate the proposed strategy and conclusions are presented in Section 8.In order to numerically describe the configuration of the body or structure the FEM is employed here. In this study the adopted finite element family is the isoparametric solid tetrahedron of any order. Regarding the kinematic approximation, the positions are used as unknown variables instead of displacements [32,36]. In this FEM version both initial and current configurations of each tetrahedral element are mapped as follows:(1)xi=(xi)k×jk(ξ)(i=1,2,3)(k=1,nnpe)(2)yi=(yi)k×jk(ξ)(i=1,2,3)(k=1,nnpe)(3)nnpe=∑i=0OPA[(i+1)(i+2)2](4)ξ={ξ1ξ2ξ3}where xiand yidenote the components of the initial (x) and current (y) position vectors, respectively; (xi)kand (yi)kare, in this order, initial and current positions along the i-direction for node k; nnpe is the number of nodes per (tetrahedral) element; OPA is the order of the polynomial approximation; and ξ is the non-dimensional tetrahedral space, defined by the set {(ξ1,ξ2,ξ3)∈R3/0≤ξ1,ξ2,ξ3,(ξ1+ξ2+ξ3)≤1} in which ξ1, ξ2 and ξ3 are called non-dimensional coordinates. Expressions (1)–(4) are generic, i.e., they are valid for any order of approximation (OPA). In this study, the current nodal positions, represented by (yi)kin Eq. (2), are the degrees of freedom of the tetrahedral finite elements.The used Lagrangian Nonlinear Continuum Mechanics kinematic measures are calculated from Eqs. (1) and (2) as(5)F=∂y∂x=F1(F0)−1(6)F0=∂x∂ξ=xk∂ϕk∂ξ(7)F1=∂y∂ξ=yk∂ϕk∂ξ(8)J=det(F)(9)C=FTF(10)E=12(C−I)where F is the total deformation gradient; F0 and F1 are, respectively, the mappings from non-dimensional space to the initial and final configurations; the superscript ( )−1 denotes the inverse of a matrix; scalar J is the Jacobian; C is the right Cauchy–Green stretch tensor; E is the Green–Lagrange strain tensor; and the symbolsdet()and I are, respectively, the determinant operator and the identity matrix.In order to use the above mentioned generalized order element, the numerical strategy developed in [31] is employed. With this technique, one can automatically calculate the shape functions (ϕk) and their derivatives∂ϕk/∂ξat any point within the element domain for any polynomial order. Such values are used in Eqs. (1), (2), (6) and (7). Section 6 shows more information regarding the calculation of these values.The mechanical behavior of materials is mathematically described by means of constitutive models – or laws. In this paper two main constitutive models are presented. The first is a general hyperelastoplastic model based mainly on the works of [21,22] and [23]. The second is a simplification for small strains, based on the works of [11,15] and [16]. Other consulted works are mentioned along the developing subsections as [13], [19] and [20], for instance. Various developing steps are described in order to make the paper self-contained.As the present analysis involves finite elastoplastic deformations, the deformation gradient (Eq. (5)) is multiplicatively decomposed into the elastic and plastic parts [13,23,37]. This decomposition is called Kröner–Lee decomposition [17–19] and can be mathematically described as follows:(11)F=FeFpwhere subscripts ( )eand ( )pcorrespond to the elastic and plastic parts, respectively. This decomposition leads to the notion of an intermediate configuration, defined as F=Fp. According to [6], this intermediate configuration is relaxed (or stress-free) and locally defined.Using Eq. (11) one can decompose the Jacobian (Eq. (8)), the right Cauchy–Green stretch tensor (Eq. (9)) and the Green–Lagrange strain tensor (Eq. (10)), which are objective strain measures, as follows:(12)J=JeJp(13)Je=det(Fe)(14)Jp=det(Fp)(15)C=(Fp)TCe(Fp)(16)Ce=(Fe)T(Fe)(17)E=(Fp)TEe(Fp)+Ep(18)Ee=1/2[(Fe)T(Fe)−I](19)Ep=1/2[(Fp)T(Fp)−I]where the symbol ( )Tdenotes the transpose of a second-order tensor. Eq. (17) shows the Green–Lagrange strain tensor multiplicative decomposition form.Similarly to hyperelastic materials [38–40], the hyperelastoplastic ones [13,19–22] are those in which the material response – or the mechanical behavior – is described by the scalar potential called Helmholtz free-energy function (ψ). In this paper, following [22], the Helmholtz free-energy function is additively decomposed into the elastic (ψe) and plastic (ψp) parts:(20)ψ=ψ(Ee,Ep,q)=ψe(Ee)+ψp(Ep,q)where q represents the hardening parameters. One can highlight two aspects of the general model described by Eq. (20): the elastic material isomorphism [22] is present, as the elastic response is not influenced by the dissipative parameters (Epand q); and it is a rate-independent elastoplastic model [9], as the material response is not affected by the strain rateĖ. Regarding specific forms for the elastic free-energy function (ψe), two models have been selected:(21)(ψe)SVK=λ2[tr(Ee)]2+μ[tr(Ee2)](22)(ψe)nH=Λ2[ln(Je)]2+μ2[tr(Ce)−3−2ln(Je)]where (ψe)SVKand (ψe)nHare, respectively, the Saint Venant–Kirchhoff [39] and the neo-Hookean hyperelastic model [41]; λ and μ are the Lamé constants; Λ is the bulk modulus; and tr( ) is the trace operator. As one can see, in both models ((21) and (22)), when the elastic strains vanish, the elastic Helmholtz function vanishes, i.e.: ψe(Ee=O)=0, in which O is the second-order null tensor.The stress measure used in the present numerical formulation is the (symmetric) second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor, represented here by S and defined at the initial configuration. In order to establish the relation among the stress and strain measures (see Section 3.1) one uses the second law of thermodynamics and the Coleman–Noll procedure. Following [22] one finds:(23)S=(Fp)−1∂ψe∂Ee(Fp)−T=(Fp)−1Se(Fp)−Twhere Seis the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor defined at the intermediate configuration (see Section 3.1).Using expressions (20) and (23), it is possible to show that the resultant internal dissipation rate [22] is(24)d=(Me−χ):Dp−(∂ψp∂q)⋅q̇≥0(25)Me=CeSe=Ce∂ψe∂Ee(26)χ=(Fp)∂ψp∂Ep(Fp)T=(Fp)X(Fp)T(27)Dp=(Fp)−TĖp(Fp)−1where Meand χ are, respectively, the Mandel stress and the backstress tensor, both defined at the intermediate configuration (see Section 3.1); the symbol:means contraction; Dpis the plastic part of the strain rate;q̇is the rate of the hardening parameters (q); X is the backstress tensor defined at the initial configuration; andĖpis the plastic Green–Lagrange strain rate. In order to fulfill the dissipation inequality (24), one must set the evolution equations by defining expressions for Dp(orĖp) and forq̇. In this paper, the evolution equations are similar to those adopted by [23] and [37]:(28)Dp=λ̇RP=λ̇∂ϕ∂Me(29)ϕ=ϕ(Me−χ,κ)=fMX(Me−χ)−fκ(κ)≤0(30)q̇={κ̇Ẋ}=λ̇{rκRX}(31)κ̇=λ̇rκ=23∥Dp∥=23(Dp:Dp)=λ̇23(RP:RP)(32)Ẋ=λ̇RX=Fp−1χ∘Fp−T−sim(2Cp−1ĖpX)(33)χ∘=χ̇−Wpχ+χWp=λ̇Rχwhereλ̇≥0is the plastic multiplier; the symbol∥∥denotes the norm of a second-order tensor; RP, rκ, Rχ and RXare, respectively, the functions that define the “direction” of DP,κ̇,χ∘andẊ; ϕ is the yield function; fMXand fκare scalar functions; κ is the parameter associated with isotropic hardening; Wpis the plastic spin tensor;χ∘is the Jaumann derivative of χ; and the symbol sim( ) denotes the symmetric part of a second-order tensor. According to [11], Eq. (28) is called plastic flow rule, the inequality (29) is the yield criterion, and expressions (31) and (32) are the evolution equations for the isotropic and kinematic hardening parameters, respectively. Specific expressions for the plastic Helmholtz function (ψp) can be found in [22,23] and [37].In the present study, the von Mises yield function is adopted, i.e.(34)ϕ=ϕ(Me−χ,κ)=‖dev(Me−χ)‖−23σκ(κ)≤0where the symboldev()denotes the deviatoric part of a second-order tensor; andσκis the yield stress. Using (28), (31) and (34) one finds:(35)κ̇=λ̇rκ=λ̇23⇒rκ=23(36)RP=∂∥dev(Me−χ)∥∂Me=dev(Me−χ)∥dev(Me−χ)∥⇒Dp=λ̇dev(Me−χ)∥dev(Me−χ)∥To define the yield stressσκ, two isotropic hardening laws are adopted:(37)σκ=c⋅(ε0+κ)n(Swiftlaw)(38)σκ=∑n=0NC-1[an(κ)n](Polynomiallaw)where κ is the isotropic hardening parameter, see Eqs. (31) and (35); c, ε0 and n are the material parameters of the Swift isotropic hardening law [6]; andNCis the number of coefficients (a) of the polynomial law.Regarding the evolution of the kinematic parameter at the intermediate configurationχ(Eq. (33)), the nonlinear Armstrong–Frederick model is chosen:(39)χ∘=λ̇Rχ=cDp−λ̇bχ⇒Rχ=cRP−bχwhere b and c are material parameters; and the second-order function Rpis given in Eq. (36).Finally, by settingWp=O, one can show that the plastic gradient rate is(40)Ḟp=DpFp=λ̇RPFPThe approximationWp=Ois also adopted by [6] and [16], for example; however, some authors have preferred to define constitutive expressions for the plastic spin tensorWp(see, for instance, [42] and the references herein).To determine the plastic multiplier in the evolution process the consistency condition must be solved, i.e.:(41)λ̇ϕ̇=0So, if the scalarλ̇is positive, it can be found via expressions (28), (30)–(33), (39) and (40) that:(42)ϕ̇=∂ϕ∂E:Ė+∂ϕ∂Fp:Ḟp+∂ϕ∂X:Ẋ+∂ϕ∂κκ̇=0⇒λ̇=−∂ϕ/∂E[(∂ϕ/∂Fp):(RPFp)+(∂ϕ/∂X):RX+(∂ϕ/∂κ)rκ]:Ė=B:Ė⇒B=−∂ϕ/∂E[(∂ϕ/∂Fp):(RPFp)+(∂ϕ/∂X):RX+(∂ϕ/∂κ)rκ]Combining the stress–strain relation (Eq. (23)), the evolution Eqs. (28)–(33) and (42), one can determine the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor (S) evolution, in elastoplastic regime, that is(43)Ṡ=∂∂t(Fp−1SeFp−T)=∂∂t(Fp−1)SeFp−T+Fp−1ṠeFp−T+Fp−1Se∂∂t(Fp−T)=℘hep:Ėwhere℘hep=∂S/∂Eis the fourth-order hyperelastoplastic consistent tangent operator. Explicit equations to calculate this fourth-order tensor are given in the Appendix A. According to [14], by using the elastoplastic consistent tangent operator, the convergence is improved and, thus, the processing time is reduced.In some applications, the strain evolution results in small values, therefore the additive decomposition of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor (see Eqs. (10), (17)–(19)), into the elastic and plastic parts can be employed [11,15]:(44)E=Ee+Ep⇒Ee=E−EpHowever, one should stress that, if finite strain develops, the elastic response can depend on the plastic strains [16]. Eq. (44) can be found by settingFp≈Iin the general expression (17).Using Eq. (44), we have the following results:(45)ψe=ψe(Ee)=ψe(E−Ep)(elasticHelmholtzfunction)(46)S=∂ψ∂Ee=∂ψ∂(E−Ep)(secondPiola−Kirchhoffstresstensor)(47)ϕ=ϕ(S−X,κ)=∥dev(S−X)∥−23σκ≤0(vonMisesyieldfunction)(48)Ėp=λ̇RP=λ̇∂ϕ∂S=λ̇dev(S−X)∥dev(S−X)∥(plasticflowrule)(49)κ̇=λ̇rκ=λ̇23(evolutionoftheisotropicparameter)(50)Ẋ=λ̇RX=cĖp−λ̇bX(Armstrong−Frederickkinematichardening)(51)λ̇=−(ϕ,E)[(ϕ,Ep):RP+(ϕ,κ)rκ+(ϕ,X):RX]:Ė(plasticmultiplier)(52)Ṡ=℘e:[II−(RP⊗(ϕ,E)[(ϕ,Ep):RP+(ϕ,κ)rκ+(ϕ,X):RX])]:Ė(stressevolution)(53)℘e=∂2ψe∂Ee∂Ee=∂2ψe∂(E−Ep)∂(E−Ep)(elastictangentoperator)where the symbolsIIand⊗denote, respectively, the fourth-order identity tensor and the tensor product.In the present study the equilibrium of each finite element (Section 2) and, hence, of the whole structure is described at the current configuration (y) by means of the Principle of Stationary Potential Energy. In static and isothermal structural problems, this equilibrium principle can be described, in Lagrangian formulation, as follows [40,43]:(54)fint(y)=∫Ω0(∂ψ∂y)dV0=∫Ω0(∂ψ∂E:∂E∂y)dV0=∫ξ(S:∂E∂y)J0dξ=fextwherefintandfextare called, respectively, the internal and external force vectors; Ω0 denotes the initial domain;dV0is an infinitesimal volume element at the initial configuration (x);dξis an infinitesimal element of the non-dimensional tetrahedral space ξ (see Section 2); and(εlin)12is the determinant of the transformationx1x2, see Eqs. (1) and (6). Vectoryrepresents the current nodes positions, i.e., the unknown variables, usually called in FEM formulations as degrees of freedom (see Section 2).In order to solve the nonlinear system of equations, which arise from expression (54), the Newton–Raphson iterative technique is employed:(55)r=fint−fext(56)H=∂r∂y=∂fint∂y=∫Ω0(∂2ψ∂y∂y)dV0=∫ξ(∂S∂E:∂E∂y∂E∂y+S:∂2E∂y∂y)J0dξ(57)r+∂r∂y⋅Δy=0⇒Δy=−H⋅rwhereris the residual force vector, also called out-of-balance force vector [14]; andHis the Hessian (or tangent stiffness) matrix. As one can note in expression (56), the external forces (fext) are considered conservative, i.e., the applied forces do not depend of the current configuration (y). Besides, to obtain the equilibrium path (or the successive equilibrated positions) the external forces are incrementally applied, that is, they are divided into load steps. It is obvious from Eq. (56) that to find the equilibrium position it is necessary to simultaneously solve the non-linear stress–strain relation (constitutive model) theoretically discussed in Section 3. Next section discusses the numerical treatment of the constitutive models.As mentioned before, in elastoplastic regime, inside the Newton–Raphson procedure adopted to find the equilibrium position, one must solve the current state of mechanical variables following the adopted constitutive model. For the hyperelastoplastic model, this current state is defined here by the set (F,Fp,κ,X). In order to do so an elastic predictor/plastic corrector algorithm [14] is used. In the prediction stage, the plastic variables are assumed to be constant along a generic load step (see Section 4), resulting:(58)ΔF=F(1)−F(0)≠O(59)ΔFp=ΔX=O(60)Δκ=0where the subscripts (0) and (1) denote, respectively, the corresponding values at the beginning and at the end of the finite incrementΔF. As the plastic variables do not vary at the prediction stage, one determines the derivative∂S/∂Eto be applied in the Newton–Raphson iterative technique, see expressions (55)–(57), as follows:(61)∂S∂E=∂∂E[(Fp)−1Se(Fp)−T]=(Fp)−1∂Se∂E(Fp)−T=(Fp)−1(∂Se∂Ee:∂Ee∂E)(Fp)−T=(Fp)−1{℘e:∂∂E[(Fp)−T(E−Ep)(Fp)−1]}(Fp)−T=(Fp)−1{℘e:[(Fp)−TII(Fp)−1]}(Fp)−Twhere℘eis the (fourth-order) elastic consistent tangent operator [9].At the beginning of an increment the (initial) state of variables(F,Fp,κ,X)(0)satisfies both equilibrium Eq. (54) and yield criterion (expression (29)), and the trial state variables[F(1),(Fp,κ,X)(0)]satisfy the equilibrium Eq. (54). IfΔu1, then the elastic prediction is correct. Otherwise, the plastic variables(Fp,κ,X)must be updated in order to makex2=1.0. This update is called plastic correction [14]. As the constitutive equations for the plastic variables (Fp,κ,X) are given in rate form (see expressions (28)–(33)) it is necessary to find the infinitesimal variation of such variables to proceed the updating.A fully implicit Euler scheme is used to integrate the internal variable along a finite increment ofΔy(orΔF). This integration scheme is called radial return algorithm as the von Mises yield function is adopted [12]. To update the state of plastic variables (Fp,κ,X) respecting the conditionϕ=0at the end of the finite increment (ΔF), the following system of equations, generated from Eqs. (28)–(33), is employed:(62)(Fp)=(Fp)(0)+Δλ(RP)(Fp)(63)κ=κ(0)+Δλ(rκ)(64)X=X(0)+Δλ(RX)(65)ϕ(F(1),Fp,κ,X)=0The quantities with subscript (0) represent known values at the beginning of the increment (obtained from the last increment solution). The trial valueF(1)is not corrected in the plastic return but in the equilibrium process. Values without index are variable and correspond to the state at the end of the return procedure. The system of Eqs. (62)–(65) is solved by the Newton–Raphson iterative scheme forFp, κ,XandΔλ. The corresponding residual vector is(66)rret={(Fp)−(Fp)(0)−Δλ(RP)(Fp)κ−κ(0)−Δλ(rκ)X−X(0)−Δλ(RX)ϕ}In this expression, one should note thatFpandXhave nine components. To apply the Newton–Raphson technique, it is necessary to calculate the derivatives of all the components ofrretwith respect toFp, κ,XandΔλ. These variables are updated until the vectorrretis sufficiently small.After the solving the system the plastic variables (Fp,κ,X) are updated and the equilibrium Eq. (54) must be verified. If the residual force vector (55) is not sufficiently small, the Newton–Raphson iterative technique is used again in order to obtain a new current position (y) and, thus, a new deformation gradient (F). With this new current configuration (y), if the yield criteria (29) is not satisfied, the elastic predictor/plastic corrector algorithm is employed again to guarantee thatϕ=0. As one can see, the iterative procedure continues until the state of variables (F,Fp,κ,X) guarantees, simultaneously, equilibrium (r=0) and yield criterion condition (ϕ=0).For the Green–Naghdi formulation (Section 3.6), the state of mechanical variables, which must satisfy both equilibrium (54) and yield criterion (29), is represented by the set (E,Ep,κ,X). Thus, during the elastic prediction phase, expressions (58) and (59) are replaced by(67)ΔE=E(1)−E(0)≠O(68)ΔEp=ΔX=OFor the plastic correction phase, according to Eqs. (47) and (48), expressions (62) and (65) are changed to(69)(Ep)=(Ep)(0)+Δλ(RP)(70)ϕ(E(1),Ep,κ,X)=0Therefore, in the case of Green–Naghdi formulation, the residual vector (66) is replaced by(71)rret={(Ep)−(Ep)(0)−Δλ(RP)κ−κ(0)−Δλ(rκ)X−X(0)−Δλ(RX)ϕ}In this section, some computational aspects are described, such as the general expressions to calculate the shape functions and their derivatives, the computer algorithm flowchart and the solver used.As mentioned in the introduction, the objective of this paper is to achieve reliable stress fields inside a 3D solid developing hyperelastoplasticity. Therefore, some computational aspects of this study can be highlighted. First of all, it is necessary to calculate the derivatives of the tetrahedral element shape functions regarding dimensionless variables to be applied in the basic kinematic developments of Section 2. This calculation must be automatic, that is, not dependent on the order of the element.Shape functions are written as(72)ϕi=(Mcoef)ij(vξ)jAnd can be calculated at the desired nodal dimensionless positions as(73)ϕik=(Mcoef)ij(vξ)jkwhere ϕikis a diagonal matrix for which lines i represent the desired shape function and columns k the associated node;(Mcoef)ijis a matrix that contain the full unknown polynomial coefficients j related to the evaluated shape function i; and(vξ)jkcontain the values of the complete set of dimensionless coordinates j used to compose the polynomial approximation calculated at the desired shape function nodal point k. Inverting(vξ)jkone finds(Mcoef)ijas ϕikis diagonal and applies (72) to calculate general shape functions.The derivatives of shape functions are done directly from expression (72), i.e.(74)∂ϕi∂ξj=(Mcoef)il∂∂ξj(vξ)lj=(Mcoef)il(Mξ)ljMore details regarding general expressions can be seen in [31].The flowchart of the computer algorithm is provided inFig. 1. Gaussian quadrature is used to calculate integrals of expressions (54) and (56). The numerical integration points and weights are given by [44–46]. The elastic predictor/plastic corrector algorithm, described in Section 5, is performed at each Gauss point. In the present study, no reduced integration schemes [24] and no hourglass modes stabilization [25] are employed, i.e., the elements are fully integrated. Regarding the solution of the systemH⋅Δy=−r, expression (57), the sub-routine MA57 [47] is used. The relative error adopted to verify convergence is calculated for unrestricted nodes as(75)Error=abs(norm1norm2)(76)norm1=∑[(Δy)i]2(77)norm2=∑(xi)2The computer code developed is written in FORTRAN language. Distributed memory parallel processing techniques [35] are employed in order to reduce the processing time and improve the memory capacity. The calculation of the local internal forces (fint) and the local Hessian matrices (H) is parallelized, i.e., each processor performs these calculations for its elements. However, only one processor (the master) assembles and solves the global systemH·Δy=−r.To validate the present formulation some problems have been analyzed using the developed computer code. The main results of the simulations are given in this section. In all the examples, the adopted tolerance for the error, see Eqs. (75)–(77), and for the yield criterion (34) is10−6.The first example is a prismatic bar under uniaxial deformation (seeFig. 2). This problem is studied in [23], and the material is a metal (mild steel CK15). Only kinematic hardening is present, as the isotropic hardening law is a constant function, see Fig. 2 and Eq. (38). The problem is performed incrementally via displacement control applied at the facex1=10.0. As the strain field is homogeneous all over the bar it is not necessary to make a mesh refinement convergence analysis, and linear approximation can be used. The bar is then discretized by six linear tetrahedral solid finite elements.The evolution of the longitudinal backstress, defined at the intermediate configuration and associated with kinematic hardening (see Eq. (26)), is showed inFig. 3. The agreement between the results of this paper and the ones of the reference [23] can be clearly seen inFig. 4a, in which the following equations are used:(78)F=[λ1000λ2000λ3](79)σ=[σ100000000]=[P1/(λ2λ3S0)00000000](80)εlin=[εlin1000εlin2000εlin3]=F−Iwhereλiis the stretching along directionxi;σis the Cauchy stress tensor;σ1is the normal stress along direction x1; P1 is the longitudinal applied force at the face x1=10.0 (see Fig. 2), whose initial cross-section area isS0;εlinis the linearized strain; andεliniis the normal linearized strain along direction xi. The above expressions are defined in respect to the coordinate system shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 4b, shows the discrepancy between the hyperelastoplastic model (Sections 3.1–3.5) and the Green–Naghdi elastoplastic model (Section 3.6) when moderate and large strains take place.The second numerical problem, also extracted from [23], is a cube under simple shear conditions (seeFig. 5). The material in this case is a glassy polymer. As in the first example, six solid tetrahedral elements of linear order are used and no mesh convergence analysis is necessary. Displacement control is incrementally applied at the face x2=1.0 along direction x1, and all the other degrees of freedom are restricted. Thus, all the current positions are known at a given deformation level, and the unknown variables are the plastic parameters.One can see, inFig. 6, the effects of the kinematic hardening on the backstress defined at the intermediate configuration (see Eq. (26)). As in the first numerical example, the accordance of the present formulation results with the reference [23] is showed inFig. 7a, in which the following equations are used:(81)F=[1γ120010001](82)σ=[0τ120τ1200000]=[0(P1/S0)0(P1/S0)00000](83)εlin=[1εlin120010001]=[1(γ12/2)0010001]=[1Δu1/(2L2)0010001]where γ12 is the amount of shear on the planex1x2; τ12 is the Cauchy shear stress component; P1 is the force applied along direction x1 at the face x2=1.0 (see Fig. 5), whose initial cross-section area isS0=1.0;εlinis the linearized strain;(εlin)12is the linearized shear strain of planex1x2;Δu1is the displacement of face x2=1.0 (see Fig. 5); and L2=1.0 is the initial length of the cube along direction x2. The above expressions are defined regarding the coordinate system illustrated in Fig. 5. Along all the numerical simulation, the value of the cross-section area S0 remains the same. Again, the results of the hyperelastoplastic model (Sections 3.1–3.5) and the Green–Naghdi elastoplastic model (Section 3.6) are very different for moderate and large strains (see Fig. 7b), and the Cauchy stress evolution with the linearized shear strain results are in perfect agreement with the ones presented by [23].The third example is a tridimensional elastomeric block under partial compression (seeFig. 8). The material properties are the same as the second example (see Fig. 5). Due to the double symmetry, in respect to the planes x2=10.0 and x3=10.0, only one quarter of the block has been discretized (see Fig. 8). The Green–Naghdi elastoplastic model (see Section 3.6) is not used to solve this problem.Regarding the vertical displacement of point A, the problem solution converges to the reference solution presented by [23] (seeTable 1 andFig. 9). One can observe that, although mesh refinement improves the accuracy, it increases the processing time significantly (see Table 1). For the most refined mesh, the displacement field at the end of some specific steps is depicted inFig. 10. A convergence analysis regarding the backstress tensorXat the end of step 50 is illustrated inFig. 11, in which one can note that, although the most refined mesh of linear order provides quite good results regarding displacements, it presents severe locking regarding the backstress componentX11.As pointed out in Section 3.5, the hyperelastoplastic consistent tangent operator (℘hep) has been developed, see Eq. (43). Thus, in order to show the improvement in the solution convergence, one of the meshes employed here has been analyzed again comparing two strategies: the purely elastic prediction, i.e., without using the consistent operator℘hep; and the elastoplastic prediction, using the consistent operator℘hep. The mesh used for this comparison has 75 nodes (225 degrees of freedom) and 24 elements of quadratic order. The analysis has been carried out until the end of phase 1 (step 50). As one can see inFig. 12, the use of the hyperelastoplastic consistent operator reduces considerably the number of iterations and the processing time, and the results regarding displacements are practically the same for the two strategies.To show the influence of the number of processors on the simulation time and, thus, to justify the use of refined discretizations with parallel processing, some meshes have been analyzed again using different number of processors. In this case, the simulation has been performed until the end of phase 1 (step 50). Considering the meshes used here (seeTable 2), for all the approximation orders, increasing the number of processors reduces significantly the processing time, as expected.Finally, in order to check the performance of the elements in the near-incompressibility situation, the present problem has been analyzed with different elastic parameters: Λ=369230.83 and µ=73.8511. These coefficients correspond to a Young modulus of E=221.5385 and a Poisson's ratio of ν=0.4999. The elements of linear order present severe locking even for a large number of elements, and the cubic and fourth-order elements suffices for this example (seeTable 3 andFig. 13).The same block of the last example (see Fig. 8) has been numerically analyzed via displacement control. The material, in this case, is a dual phase steel with the following properties [1]:Linear hyperelastic law (Eq. (21)):(84)λ=121153.85,ν=80769.23Swift law for the isotropic hardening (Eq. (37)):(85)c=1093.0,ε0=0.0016626225,n=0.1870These Lamé constants are equivalent to a Young modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson coefficient of 0.30. In the present analysis, the surface where pressure was applied for the last example (see Fig. 8) has the following prescribed vertical displacement:(86)Phase1(100increments):u1=−5.0(87)Phase2(100increments):u1=0.0whereu1is the vertical displacement (along direction x1) at the end of each phase.According toTable 4, the linear tetrahedral element is not able to run this problem using any mesh density. Again, locking disappears when high order polynomials are employed and convergence is achieved by improving the mesh density.Fig. 14 shows the applied pressure regarding the imposed displacement. Two distributions of the isotropic hardening parameter, see Eqs. (31) and (35), are illustrated inFig. 15.The fifth example is a prismatic beam under a prescribed vertical displacement (seeFig. 16). The beam is composed of mild steel, and the material data have been extracted from [1]. Due to the symmetry regarding the plane x2=0.0, only a half of the beam is discretized. Four different discretizations with tetrahedral elements have been adopted: 18, 36, 72 and 144. As in the other examples, the approximation order varies from one to four. The objective of simulating this example is to compare the hyperelastoplastic and Green–Naghdi models (see Section 3) for structural problems with large displacements and small strains.Regarding displacements, the influence of the mesh refinement on the beam behavior is depicted inTable 5. One can note that the meshes of linear elements present severe locking. A displacement comparison between the hyperelastoplastic model and the Green–Naghdi elastoplastic model can be seen inFig. 17. From this result one concludes that the meshes with 144 tetrahedral elements of linear degree have presented severe locking; and the reaction forces are almost the same for the quadratic, cubic and fourth order tetrahedral elements. These facts indicate that, for small strains, the two models are equivalent. Moreover, the simulation of this problem with the Green–Naghdi formulation provides a processing time slightly smaller when compared to the hyperelastoplastic formulation (see Table 5). The final distribution of the isotropic hardening parameter κ, for both models (see Eqs. (35) and (49)), are also equivalent, as depicted inFig. 18.The last numerical example, extracted from [48] and proposed by [49], is the upsetting of a cylindrical metallic specimen (seeFig. 19). According to the first reference, in this problem, large compressive strains and mesh distortion take place. Due to the symmetry regarding the planes x1=0.0, x2=0.0 and x3=0.0, only one eighth of the cylinder is discretized. To simulate this example, 72 tetrahedral finite elements with variable approximation order have been employed.In order to show the convergence analysis of the problem by increasing the element order, the total reaction force versus the applied displacement is depicted inFig. 20. Final distributions of the vertical displacement (u3) and the plastic strain component (Ep)33 are showed inFigs. 21 and 22.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Tetrahedral high order finite elements have been proposed to solve elastoplastic problems developing large strains. Two main constitutive models have been implemented and tested. The first is a general hyperelastoplastic model based mainly on the works of [22] and [23]. The second is a simplification for small strains, based on the works of [11,15] and [16]. By comparisons one can easily note the differences between the two formulations and, therefore, discard the second model for large strain applications. As the processing time for the second model is slightly smaller, this formulation can be used to analyze beams, plates and shells, in which finite deformation and small strains take place.The tetrahedral elements are isoparametric of any-order based on the positional FEM. No alternative techniques (such as enhanced assumed strain method, reduced or selective integration and hourglass stabilization) are used. Regarding the numerical approximation, the main hypothesis employed here is that the use of high order elements avoids locking problems. As the increase in the number of processors reduces the processing time significantly, the use of high order elements is enabled by parallel processing. Moreover, we achieved our task by an important convergence analysis demonstrating that using high order elements the error control for practical large strain elastoplastic applications is feasible. According to the numerical examples, mesh refinement improves the convergence regarding displacements and plastic variables, such as plastic strains, backstress and isotropic hardening parameter. Therefore, the objective of finding a precise stress distribution inside solids under large elastoplastic strains has been achieved. The formulation can be used for further developments, such as the implementation of anisotropic models, non-associative flow rules and contact algorithms.As expected, the use of the hyperelastoplastic consistent tangent operator improves the convergence, reducing the number of iterations and the processing time. Another point to be highlighted is the fact that, in the near-incompressibility situation, the meshes of linear degree present severe locking, even for a large number of elements, and the cubic and fourth orders suffices for this situation.
