@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this study, we discuss linear orders of intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs). Then we introduce an intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic average operator. Some fundamental properties of this operator are investigated. Based on the introduced operator, we propose a new model for intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attributes decision making. The proposed model deals with the degree of membership and degree of nonmembership separately. It is resistant to extreme data.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since the theory of fuzzy sets was introduced by Zadeh (1965), there have been a number of studies carried out both in the theoretical as well as practical areas. An important generalization of the fuzzy sets in the sense of Zadeh are intuitionistic fuzzy sets(IFS) introduced by Atanassov (1986). Unlike “classical” fuzzy set, an IFS A does not require that the sum of the degrees of membership and nonmembership of an element to A equals one. In other words, an IFS allows for a degree of hesitation. Notice that the IFS was reintroduced by Gau and Buehrer (1993) under the name of vague sets. Bustince and Burillo (1996) pointed out that vague sets are in fact IFSs.Fuzzy sets theory has been applied successfully to many fields including multi-attribute decision making (MADM) (Barrenechea, Fernandez, Pagola, Chiclana, & Bustince, 2014; Chakrabortty, Pal, & Nayak, 2013; Dubois & Prade, 1980; Huang, Zhuang, & Li, 2013; Pedrycz, 2014; Xu & Da, 2002; Yager, 1988). In some real-world situations, decision makers are faced with a facet of hesitation and as a result some evaluations can be conveniently realized with the use of IFSs. For example, in a voting process, we witness approvals, rejections and abstentions. To deal with these situations, some authors employed similar methods used in fuzzy MADM problems. For example, some well-known aggregation operators, such as the weighted arithmetic (geometric) average operators and the ordered weighted arithmetic (geometric) average operators, have been generalized to the intuitionistic fuzzy environment (Xu, 2007; Xu & Yager, 2006; Yang & Chen, 2012). However these operators exhibit a common drawback: they are easily affected by some extreme data.The main objective of this paper is to develop a new model for MADM problems under intuitionistic fuzzy environment, which is not easily affected by extreme data. The organization of the paper is as follows. After summarization of some previous results about IFSs (in Section 2), in Section 3, we discuss the linear orders for IFVs. It introduces a linear order—we use Szmidt and Kacprzyk’s (Szmidt & Kacprzyk) order to distinguish two IFVs whenever Atanassov’s order does not work. It is proved in this section that the introduced order is equivalent to the lexicographical one. Section 4 introduces a weighted arithmetic average operators, and then develops a new model for intuitionistic fuzzy MADM problems. We apply the proposed model to a real-life problem in Section 5. Section Section 6 delivers some conclusions.In this section, we briefly recall some essential ideas concerning intuitionistic fuzzy sets.Definition 2.1Atanassov, 1999, 2012Let X be a universal set. An IFS A on U can be mathematically expressed asA={〈x,μA(x),νA(x)〉,x∈X},where the maps μA: X → [0, 1] and νA: X → [0, 1] define the membership and nonmembership degrees of an element x ∈ X to A, respectively, and such that they satisfy the following relationship0≤μA(x)+νA(x)≤1for any x ∈ X.The function π: X → [0, 1] defined byπA(x)=1−μA(x)−νA(x)is referred to as the degree of hesitation with the membership of an element x ∈ X to A. Obviously, ifπA(x)=0for each x ∈ X then the IFS A becomes a fuzzy set in the sense of Zadeh (1965).Atanassov (1986), De, Biswas, and Roy (2000) introduced the basic operations on IFSs.Definition 2.2Let A and B be IFSs.(1)(Complement)A¯={〈x,νA(x),μA(x)〉,x∈X};(Intersection)A⋂B={〈x,min{μA(x),μB(x)},max{νA(x),νB(x)}〉,x∈X};(Union)A⋃B={〈x,max{μA(x),μB(x)},min{νA(x),νB(x)}〉,x∈X};(Sum)A+B={〈x,μA(x)+μB(x)−μA(x)μB(x),νA(x)νB(x)〉,x∈X};(Product)A·B={〈x,μA(x)μB(x),νA(x)+νB(x)−νA(x)νB(x)〉,x∈X};(Scale Multiplication)nA={〈x,1−(1−μA(x))n,(νA(x))n〉,x∈X};(Power)An={〈x,(μA(x))n,1−(1−νA(x))n〉,x∈X}.Atanassov employed the commonly used t-normTP(x,y)=xy(product) and its dual t-conormSP(x,y)=x+y−xy(probabilistic sum) to define the sum and the product of two IFSs. Xu and Yager (2006) and Xu (2007) proposed the concept of IFVs.Definition 2.3An IFV α is defined as an ordered pair 〈uα, vα〉 satisfying uα, vα≥ 0 anduα+vα≤1.In this paper, the set of all IFVs will be denoted as Θ.Based on the operations of IFSs in Definition 2.2, Xu and Yager defined a weighted arithmetic (geometric) average of IFVs.Definition 2.4Xu, 2007; Xu & Yager, 2006Let{αi}i=1n⊂Θandω=(ω1,…,ωn)Tbe a weight vector.(1)The intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic average operator IFWA is defined byIFWAω(α1,α2,…,αn)=Σi=1nωiαi.The intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric average operator IFWG is defined byIFWGω(α1,α2,…,αn)=∏i=1nαiωi.Suppose thatαi=〈ui,vi〉. One can easily prove the following two equalities:IFWAω(α1,α2,…,αn)=〈1−∏i=1n(1−ui)ωi,∏i=1nviωi〉;IFWGω(α1,α2,…,αn)=〈∏i=1nuiωi,1−∏i=1n(1−vi)ωi〉.The IFWA and IFWG operators have been widely applied to MADM problems (Li, 2011; Yang & Chen, 2012). These two operators are dual in the following sense.Proposition 2.5Letαi=〈ui,vi〉,i=1,2,…,nbe IFVs andω=(ω1,…,ωn)Tbe a weight vector. Then we have thatIFWGω(α1,α2,…,αn)=IFWAω(α¯1,α¯2,…,α¯n)¯.The following example shows that in some extreme cases, if we use the IFWA operator then we may obtain a result that is totally different from the one we produce when using the IFWG operator, see also Beliakov, Bustince, Goswami, Mukherjee, and Pal (2011).Example 2.6Let{A1,…,Am}be the set of alternatives andX={x1,…,xn}the attributes set. Suppose A1 is described by{α1,α2,…,αn}satisfyingα1=〈0,1〉,α2=〈1,0〉andω=(ω1,ω2,…,ωn)Tis an arbitrary weight vector with ω1 > 0, ω2 > 0. If we use IFWA operator thenIFWAω(α1,α2,…,αn)=〈1,0〉,which implies that A1 is the best choice (no matter what the other values are). But if we use IFWG operator thenIFWGω(α1,α2,…,αn)=〈0,1〉,which implies that A1 is the worst choice.From the above observations, we conclude that the IFWA operator is easily affected by extremely large values of data, while the IFWG operator is easily affected by extremely low data. To overcome this shortage, Beliakov et al. (2011) (see also Xia, Xu, & Zhu (2012)) introduced averaging operators for IFVs by using a continuous Archimedean t-norm and its dual t-conorm. We have(2.1)IFWAω(α1,α2,…,αn)=〈h−1(∑i=1nwih(ui)),g−1(∑i=1nwig(vi))〉,where g is the additive generator of a continuous Archimedean t-norm and h is the additive generator of its dual t-conorm. Beliakov et al. (2011) also pointed out that (2.1) is consistent with the operation on ordinary fuzzy sets if and only if the t-norm is Łukasiewicz one. In this case, (2.1) becomesIFWAω(α1,α2,…,αn)=〈∑i=1nwiui,∑i=1nwivi〉.Notice that this operator was discussed in Xu and Yager (2009), and also introduced in Chen and Tan (1994). This operator can be obtained by computing the weighted arithmetic means of the membership degree and the nonmembership degree, respectively. Similarly, we can introduce the following operator (although it is sensitive for extreme data), which we will call it the intuitionistic fuzzy pseudo weighted geometric average operator (IFPWG), by computing the weighted geometric means of the membership degree and the nonmembership degree, respectively. That is, we haveIFPWGω(α1,α2,…,αn)=〈∑i=1nuiwi,∑i=1nviwi〉.It is easy to see that IFPWG is monotonic with respect to the partial order introduced by Atanassov (1999), refer to Section 3. That is, ifαi=〈ui,vi〉,αi☆=〈ui☆,vi☆〉,i=1,2,…,nbe IFVs with bothui≤ui☆andvi≥vi☆for any i, thenIFPWGω(α1,…,αn)≤IFPWGω(α1☆,…,αn☆)for any weight vector ω. In virtue of the idempotency of the weighted geometric average, we conclude thatIFPWGω(α,α,…,α)=αfor any IFV α. Moreover, from the monotonicity and the idempotency of the IFPWG operator, we know that IFPWG is bounded, that is,α̲≤IFPWGω(α1,α2,…,αn)≤α¯,whereα̲=∩i=1nαi=〈mini{ui},maxi{vi}〉andα¯=∪i=1nαi=〈maxi{ui},mini{vi}〉. We also point out that IFPWG cannot be deduced from (2.1).One of the crucial problems in the context of decision making (when the IFVs are used) is the ranking of IFVs. Atanassov (1999) proposed an order for IFVs:Letα=〈u1,v1〉,β=〈u2,v2〉be two IFVs. We say that α ≤Aβ if both u1 ≤ u2 and v1 ≥ v2.Unfortunately, ≤Ais just a partial order. In order to apply IFVs to decision making, a linear(total) order is desired. There are several total orders of IFVs available in the literature (see Liu & Wang, 2007, for example). Here we recall the orders proposed by Bustince, Fernandez, Kolesárová, and Mesiar (2013a), Chen and Tan (1994), Hong and Choi (2000) and Szmidt and Kacprzyk (2009).Bustince et al. (2013a) introduced the admissible order of intervals, see also Bustince, Galar, Bedregal, Kolesárová, and Mesiar (2013b). By using L([0, 1]), we denote the set of all closed subinterval of [0, 1]. A binary relation ⪯ on L([0, 1]) is an admissible order if it is a linear order and [a, b]⪯[c, d] whenever a ≤ c and b ≤ d. It is well known that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Θ and L([0, 1]):〈u,v〉↪[u,1−v],so we can translate corresponding results from L([0, 1]) to Θ. For example, a binary relation ⪯ on Θ is an admissible order if it is a linear order and 〈u1, v1〉⪯〈u2, v2〉 whenever u1 ≤ u2 and1−v1≤1−v2(i.e., v1 ≥ v2), that is, an admissible order on Θ is a linear order refining ≤A.Recall that the score function (Chen & Tan, 1994) and the accuracy function (Hong & Choi, 2000) of IFVs are defined as follows.The score functions:Θ→[−1,1]is defined in the forms(α)=u−v,and the accuracy function h: Θ → [0, 1] is expressed in the following wayh(α)=u+v,whereα=〈u,v〉∈Θ. Using the score function and the accuracy function, we can introduce an order over Θ (Xu, 2008). For two IFVs α, β, we say that α ≥ β whenever s(α) > s(β) or boths(α)=s(β)and h(α) ≥ h(β). This order is an admissible one.Szmidt and Kacprzyk (2009) introduced a measure R: Θ → [0, 1] for IFVs. For an IFV α,(3.1)R(α)=0.5(1+πα)l(M,α),where l( ·, ·) is the normalized Hamming distance between two IFVs andM=〈1,0〉is the largest IFV. Letα=〈u,v〉,then the normalized Hamming distance α from M can be represented asl(α,M)=12(|u−1|+|v−0|+|1−u−v−0|)=1−u.Thus we have that(3.2)R(α)=0.5(2−u−v)(1−u).By using (3.2), Szmidt and Kacprzyk proposed an order for IFVs- the lower the value of R(α), the better. Unlike the order based on the score and accuracy functions, this order is only a partial one. For example,R(〈0.5,0.3〉)=R(〈0.4,0.6〉)=0.3. Fortunately, we have the following result:Proposition 3.1Letα=〈u1,v1〉andβ=〈u2,v2〉. If α, β cannot be distinguished by Atanassov’s order ≤A, then they can be distinguished by the above order R.Suppose ≤Acannot distinguish α, β. There are two cases: u1 > u2, v1 > v2 and u1 < u2, v1 < v2. From (3.2) we can see that if u1 > u2, v1 > v2 then R(α) < R(β) which means α is better. Similarly, for the other case, β is better.□By Proposition 3.1, we know that the following order of Θ is an admissible one.Definition 3.2Let α, β ∈ Θ. We say that α ≤ β if one of the following two statements holds:(i)α ≤Aβ;α, β is incomparable under ≤A, but R(α) ≥ R(β).Interesting enough, we can prove the following result.Proposition 3.3The order in Definition3.2is a lexicographical order.Letα=〈u1,v1〉andβ=〈u2,v2〉. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that u1 ≥ u2.If u1 > u2, there are two cases. Case (i): If v1 ≤ v2 then by Atanassov’s order we have that α > β. Case (ii): If v1 > v2 then Atanassov’s order does not work. By (3.2), it holds that R(α) < R(β), again α > β.Ifu1=u2,there are also two cases. Case (i): If v1 ≤ v2 then by Atanassov’s order we have that α ≥ β. Case (ii): If v1 > v2 then by Atanassov’s order we have that α < β.From the above analysis we can see, if the first component can distinguish two IFVs then we use the first one to distinguish them, otherwise we use the second one to distinguish them. That is to say, the order is a lexicographical one.□Although the above-mentioned orders are admissible ones, the following examples show that all of them are sensitive for small changes of the components in some cases.Example 3.4Letα1=〈0.1,0〉,α2=〈0.2,0.11〉,α3=〈0.3,0.22〉,α4=〈0.4,0.33〉andα5=〈0.5,0.44〉. It is easy to see s(α1) > s(α2) > s(α3) > s(α4) > s(α5), which means that if we use the order based on the score and accuracy functions then α1 > α2 > α3 > α4 > α5. If we change a little the nonmembership values of the above IFVs, i.e.,α1=〈0.1,0〉,α2=〈0.2,0.1〉,α3=〈0.3,0.2〉,α4=〈0.4,0.3〉andα5=〈0.5,0.4〉,then we obtain the same score for each αi. But h(α5) > h(α4) > h(α3) > h(α2) > h(α1), thus α5 > α4 > α3 > α2 > α1. If we use the lexicographical order, then we have α5 > α4 > α3 > α2 > α1 in both cases.Letα1=〈0.24,0.7〉,α2=〈0.23,0.6〉,α3=〈0.22,0.5〉,α4=〈0.21,0.4〉andα5=〈0.2,0.3〉. If we use the lexicographical order then we have α1 > α2 > α3 > α4 > α5. If we change a little the membership values of the above IFVs, i.e.,α1=〈0.2,0.7〉,α2=〈0.2,0.6〉,α3=〈0.2,0.5〉,α4=〈0.2,0.4〉andα5=〈0.2,0.3〉,then by the lexicographical order we have α5 > α4 > α3 > α2 > α1. If we use the order based on the score and accuracy functions, then we have α5 > α4 > α3 > α2 > α1 in both cases.Let us analyze why these orders are sensitive for small changes of the component. Every IFV can be regarded as a point of the real plane R2, thus Θ is a subset of R2. Notice that the natural order of R2 is only a partial one. For the subset Θ, the natural order is Atanassov’s order. In decision making problems we should build a linear order based on this partial one. Thus, no matter what kind of order we use, we will encounter the same situations.To see both orders in a better perspective it is worth returning to the results presented in Examples 3.4 and 3.5. First, the stability of the results obtained in Example 3.4 is not the only advantage of the lexicographical order. Even more important is the result obtained. It is difficult just to agree for the ranking resulting from the order based on the score and accuracy, namely, thatα1=〈0.1,0〉should be ranked higher thanα5=〈0.5,0.44〉. Certainly, if we wish a decision with the highest risk then α1 is better. In fact, neither α1 nor α5 are not good alternatives (the same concerns all the rest of alternatives considered in the Example 3.4). However, it is difficult to agree that alternative α1 with lower membership value (equal to 0.1 whereas membership value of α5 is higher and equal to 0.5) and with a higher hesitation margin π (whereπ=1−μ−νpoints out lack of knowledge and is equal to 0.9 for α1 whereas π for α5 is lower and equal to 0.06) should be accepted as a better alternative.The results (ranking) obtained in Example 3.4 speak in favor of the lexicographical order.In the first part of Example 3.5 we have the same situation as in Example 3.4. The lexicographical order ranksα1=〈0.24,0.7〉as a better one thanα5=〈0.2,0.3〉because the membership value of alternative α1 (equal to 0.24) is bigger than the membership value of alternative α5 (equal to 0.2), and the hesitation margin of α1 (equal to 0.06) is lower than the hesitation margin of α5 (equal to 0.5). It is worth stressing here that Definition 3.2 (ii) was applied to obtain the result. However, if we use the order based on the score (accuracy is not taken here into account), the order is opposite - alternative with lower membership function and higher value of the lack of knowledge is ranked higher (less positive aspects and higher risk are ranked better which is not easy to accept).In the second part of the Example 3.5 we have all the alternatives with the same membership values (equal to 0.2), and with different non-membership values. The same membership values mean that we consider the situation on the border of the subset of R2 where Atanassov’s order is natural, and the set where the Atanassov’s order does not exist. As for the equal membership values we should make use of Definition 3.2. (i) (opposite to the first part of the Example 3.5 where part (ii) was applied), the order we obtain by the lexicographical order changes. However, if we assumed that on the border of both areas still Definition 3.2. (ii) should be applied, we would obtain the same order as previously, i.e. α1 > · · · > α5 ranking higher the alternatives with higher membership values and lower hesitation margins.The advantage of the lexicographical order (in the absence of Atanassov’s order) is that the alternatives with the lower hesitation margin are pointed out as the better ones. There is not such a clear rule when using the order based on the score and accuracy functions. Next, for the order based on the score and accuracy often only score is taken into account which may produce counterintuitive results (alternatives with lower membership values and higher hesitation margin are pointed out as the better ones - see Example 3.4).
