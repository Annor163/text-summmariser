@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Many networks exhibit small-world properties. The structure of a small-world network is characterized by short average path lengths and high clustering coefficients. Few graph layout methods capture this structure well which limits their effectiveness and the utility of the visualization itself. Here we present an extension to our novel graphTPP layout method for laying out small-world networks using only their topological properties rather than their node attributes. The Watts–Strogatz model is used to generate a variety of graphs with a small-world network structure. Community detection algorithms are used to generate six different clusterings of the data. These clusterings, the adjacency matrix and edgelist are loaded into graphTPP and, through user interaction combined with linear projections of the adjacency matrix, graphTPP is able to produce a layout which visually separates these clusters. These layouts are compared to the layouts of two force-based techniques. graphTPP is able to clearly separate each of the communities into a spatially distinct area and the edge relationships between the clusters show the strength of their relationship. As a secondary contribution, an edge-grouping algorithm for graphTPP is demonstrated as a means to reduce visual clutter in the layout and reinforce the display of the strength of the relationship between two communities.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Small-world networks are a commonly occurring graph structure characterized by short average path lengths and high clustering coefficients [1]. This means that even when the network is large there are very few steps between each pair of nodes. Despite their prevalence very few methods are able to lay them out such that their structure is communicated optimally [2]. Examples of networks that display these characteristics in the real-world include social networks [3], biological networks [4] and even geophysical ones [5].The high clustering coefficient of small-world networks provides an interesting problem for layout particularly as it has been shown that users seek to lay out graphs such that their clustered structure is apparent [6]. Thus, ensuring that the clustered structure of the graph is well represented in the layout seems crucial for enhancing users’ understanding of the graph in the context of its clusters and the relationships between them. van Ham and van Wijk [7] have proposed one of the few small-world network specific layout methods while Gibson and Faith [8] put forward a method based on node-attribute data.How clusters are represented in a graph is extremely important as the human perceptual system will naturally cause users to assume that there is a relationship between nodes that are placed close together [9]. For graphs that are highly clustered adhering to this principle when laying out the graph is key for communicating the structure of the network. Generally, force-directed layouts do not produce an accurate representation of small-world network structures. This is because they try to optimize the layout to have uniform edge lengths but longer edge lengths are usually required to separate clusters [2].Force-directed methods such as LinLog (linear-logarithmic) [2,10] and OpenOrd (a successor to VxOrd) [11] do try to optimize for clustering based on topology while there are other methods that use attributes or pre-computed clusterings. Muelder and Ma's treemap [12] and space-filling [13] approaches use a pre-computed clustering, while the group-in-the-box layout [14] can take any user input or pre-computed clustering.graphTPP (graph targeted projection pursuit) [8] is a method, encapsulated in an interactive software program, that has previously been used for the layout of small-world networks using node-attributes. The graph is laid out, assisted by direct user interaction, according to the specified clustering resulting in a clear visual separation of the clusters. Here we propose that rather than using node-attributes, the adjacency matrix of the graph can replace the multidimensional matrix of attributes and by significantly increasing the size of the graph (in terms of the number of nodes) demonstrates that graphTPP is scalable beyond the very small examples used in the previous work.The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses related work on the layout of small-world networks. Section 3 introduces the Watts–Strogatz model that is used for computing the small-world networks and the community detection algorithms used by the layout. Section 4 presents the graphTPP layouts of the small-world networks for both one and two-dimensional Watts–Strogatz models whilst comparing them to results obtained using the OpenOrd and ForceAtlas layout algorithms. It also introduces an edge-grouping technique for reducing visual clutter caused by the edges in the graphTPP layout. Section 5 discusses the results and the limitations of this work while also recommending directions for future work. Section 6 then concludes the paper.This research shows that graphTPP outperforms OpenOrd [11] and ForceAtlas [15] as a method for laying out small-world networks where the aim is to optimize the layout for the communities detected through various community detection algorithms. The main contribution then is the demonstration that graphTPP can be a viable layout method even when there is no typical node-attribute data available upon which to base the layout.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper has presented an extension to the small-worlds pilot study presented in Gibson and Faith [8] where graphTPP was used to lay out a small-world network using node attributes. In this case the number of nodes has been significantly increased but graphTPP still shows a superior ability to produce a layout that reflects the clustered structure of the graph compared to two force-based methods. The addition of the edge bundling method means that the strength of association between two communities is clearly visible. The use of the community detection algorithms resulted in reasonably equally sized clusters which also aided the analysis and visualization. It also showed that small-world networks are compatible with re-purposing edges as attribute values, thus graphTPP could, in theory, be applied as a viable layout option for any graph regardless of the existence of pre-existing attributes or not.A more detailed description of each of the community detection algorithms can be found in the supplementary material.Further examples of layouts of graph of different sizes clustered using the community detection algorithms, as detailed in Table 1, can be found in the supplementary material.Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2016.01.036.The following are the supplementary data to this article:
