@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper addresses the problem of determining the symmetries of a plane or space curve defined by a rational parametrization. We provide effective methods to compute the involution and rotation symmetries for the planar case. As for space curves, our method finds the involutions in all cases, and all the rotation symmetries in the particular case of Pythagorean-hodograph curves. Our algorithms solve these problems without converting to implicit form. Instead, we make use of a relationship between two proper parametrizations of the same curve, which leads to algorithms that involve only univariate polynomials. These algorithms have been implemented and tested in the Sage system.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The problem of detecting the symmetries of a curve has been studied extensively, mainly because of its applications in Pattern Recognition, Computer Graphics and Computer Vision.In Pattern Recognition, a common problem is how to choose, from a database of curves, the one which suits best a given object, represented by means of an equation (Huang and Cohen, 1996; Lei et al., 1998; Sener and Unel, 2005; Tarel and Cooper, 2000; Tasdizen et al., 2000; Taubin, 1991). Before a comparison can be carried out, one must bring the shape that needs to be identified into a canonical position. Thus it becomes necessary to compute the symmetries of the studied curve. In this context, the computation of symmetries has been addressed using splines (Huang and Cohen, 1996), by means of differential invariants (Boutin, 2000; Calabi et al., 1998; Weiss, 1993), using a complex representation of the implicit equation of the curve (Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert, 2008; Lebmeir, 2009; Tarel and Cooper, 2000), and using moments (Huang and Cohen, 1996; Suk and Flusser, 1993, 2005; Taubin and Cooper, 1992).In Computer Graphics, the detection of symmetries and similarities is important, both in the 2D and the 3D case, to gain understanding when analyzing pictures, and also in order to perform tasks like compression, shape editing or shape completion. Many techniques involve statistical methods and, in particular, clustering; see for example the papers (Berner et al., 2008; Bokeloh et al., 2009; Mitra et al., 2006; Podolak et al., 2006), where the technique of transformation voting is used. Other techniques are robust auto-alignment (Simari et al., 2006), spherical harmonic analysis (Martinet et al., 2006), primitive fitting (Schnabel et al., 2008), and spectral analysis (Lipman et al., 2010), to quote a few.In Computer Vision, symmetry is important for object detection and recognition. In this context, an analysis has been carried out using the Extended Gauss Image (Sun and Sherrah, 1997) and using feature points (Loy and Eklundh, 2006). In addition, there are algorithms for computing the symmetries of 2D and 3D discrete objects (Alt et al., 1988; Brass and Knauer, 2004; Jiang et al., 1996; Li et al., 2008) and for boundary-representation models (Li et al., 2008, 2010; Tate and Jared, 2003).In the case of discrete objects (polygons, polyhedra), the symmetries can be determined exactly (Alt et al., 1988; Brass and Knauer, 2004; Jiang et al., 1996; Li et al., 2008). This can be generalized to the case of more complicated shapes whose geometry is described by a discrete object, as done in Brass and Knauer (2004), where an efficient algorithm is provided. Examples of this situation appear with Bézier curves and tensor product surfaces, where the shape follows from the geometry of the control points. However, in almost all of the other above references, the goal is to find approximate symmetries of the shape. This is perfectly adequate in many applications, because the input is often a ‘fuzzy’ shape, with missing or occluded parts in some cases. In fact, even if the input is exact, it is often an approximate, simplified model of a real object. Here we shall consider a different perspective. We assume that our input is exact, and we want to deterministically detect the existence and nature of its symmetries, without converting to implicit form. More precisely, our input will be either a plane or a space curveCdefined by means of a rational parametrization with integer coefficients. Our goal is to (1) determine whetherChas any symmetries, and (2) determine all symmetries in the affirmative case.Notice that since we are dealing with a global object, i.e., the whole curveC, we do not have a control polygon from which the geometry of the curve, and in particular its symmetries, can be derived. This could be the case if we were addressing a piece ofC, at least whenCadmits a polynomial parametrization. In that situation,Ccould be brought into Bézier form, and then an algorithm like Brass and Knauer (2004) could be applied. In fact, in that case the algorithm of Brass and Knauer (2004) would be computationally more effective than ours, since essentially the analysis follows from a discrete object. However, this idea is no longer applicable when the whole curve is considered.Additionally, an analysis of approximate symmetries of rational curves could be attempted by sampling points on the curve, and then applying algorithms like Brass and Knauer (2004), Li et al. (2008, 2010). In that case, the question is how to choose suitable zones for sampling, which amounts to collecting some information on the shape of the curve (Alcázar and Díaz-Toca, 2010). A natural strategy is to look for notable points on the curve, like singularities, inflection points or vertices: Since any symmetry maps notable points of a certain nature to the same kind of points or leaves them invariant, one might sample around these points. One thus obtains clusters of points that must be compared. There would be various possibilities for comparing these clusters, depending on the kind of symmetry one is looking for, all which should be explored. Still, this approach only leads to an approximate estimate on the existence of symmetries, which is a different problem than the one considered in this paper.Up to our knowledge, the deterministic problem for whole curves has only been solved in the case of implicit plane curves (Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert, 2008; Lebmeir, 2009) and in the case of polynomially parametrized plane curves (Alcázar, 2014). The case of space curves seems absent from the literature. In Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert (2008), Lebmeir (2009), the authors provide an elegant method to detect rotation symmetry of an implicitly defined algebraic curve, and efficiently find the exact rotation angle and rotation center. The method uses a complex representationF(z,z¯)=0of the curve. Some cases not treated in Lebmeir and Richter-Gebert (2008) are completed in Lebmeir (2009), where similar ideas are applied to detect mirror symmetry. In contrast, our method applies directly to the parametrization, which is the most common representation in CAGD, avoiding the conversion into implicit form. The approach in Alcázar (2014) is similar to ours, although it should be noted that restricting to polynomial parametrizations yields an advantage for solving the problem fast and efficiently.The main ingredient in our method is the underlying relation between two parametrizations of a curve that are proper, i.e., injective except perhaps for finitely many values of the parameter. Essentially, whenever a symmetry is present, this symmetry induces an alternative parametrization of the curve. Furthermore, if the starting parametrization is proper, this second parametrization is also proper. Since two proper parametrizations of a same curve are related by means of a Möbius transformation (Sendra et al., 2008), we can reduce the problem to finding this transformation. Thus, involutions, i.e., symmetries with respect to a point, line or plane, can be detected and determined for plane and space curves. For rotations, we need one more ingredient: a formulation in terms of complex numbers for plane curves, or the Pythagorean-hodograph assumption for space curves. In practice, our methods boil down to computing greatest common divisors and finding real roots of univariate polynomials, which are tasks that can be performed efficiently.Throughout the paper we shall consider a rational curveC⊂Rn, wheren=2orn=3, neither a line nor a circle, defined by means of a proper rational parametrization(1)x:R⇢C⊂Rn,x(t)=(x1(t),x2(t),…,xn(t)),wherexi(t)=pi(t)qi(t),pi,qi∈R[t],gcd(pi,qi)=1,i=1,…,n.Here “gcd” refers to the greatest common divisor. SinceCis rational, it is irreducible. One can check whether a parametrization of a plane curve is proper, and every rational plane curve can be properly reparametrized without extending the ground field. See Sendra et al. (2008) for a thorough study on properness and a proof of these claims, and see Alcázar (2012, Section 3.1) for similar results for rational space curves.We recall some facts from Euclidean geometry (Coxeter, 1969). An isometry ofRnis a mapf:Rn⟶Rnpreserving Euclidean distances. Any isometry f ofRnis linear affine, taking the form(2)f(x)=Qx+b,x∈Rn,withb∈RnandQ∈Rn×nan orthogonal matrix. In particulardet(Q)=±1. The isometries of the plane and space form a group under composition that is generated by reflections, i.e., symmetries with respect to a hyperplane, or mirror symmetries. An isometry is called direct when it preserves the orientation, and opposite when it does not. In the former casedet(Q)=1, while in the latter casedet(Q)=−1. The identity mapidRnofRnis called the trivial symmetry. An isometryf(x)=Qx+bofRnis called an involution iff∘f=idRn, in which caseQ2=Iis the identity matrix andb∈ker(Q+I).The nontrivial isometries of the Euclidean plane are classified into reflections, rotations, translations, and glide reflections. The special case of central symmetries is of particular interest and corresponds to a rotation by an angle π. Central and mirror symmetries are involutions.The classification of the nontrivial isometries of Euclidean space again includes reflections (in a plane), rotations (about an axis), and translations, and these combine in commutative pairs to form twists, glide reflections, and rotatory reflections. Composing three reflections in mutually perpendicular planes through a point P, yields a central inversion with center P, i.e., a symmetry with respect to the point P. The special case of rotation by an angle π is again of special interest, and it is called an axial symmetry. Central inversions, reflections, and axial symmetries are involutions.By Bézout's theorem, an algebraic curve other than a line cannot be invariant under a translation or glide reflection, and a space curve can, in addition, not be invariant under a twist. We shall refer to the remaining isometries as symmetries, and we shall say that a plane or space curveCis symmetric, if it is invariant under a nontrivial symmetry. Any algebraic curve in the plane, neither a line nor a circle, has finitely many symmetries (Lebmeir, 2009, Section 5). We need the following lemma to show the same result for nondegenerate space curves, i.e., space curves not contained in a plane.Lemma 1LetC⊂R3be a nondegenerate irreducible space curve, invariant under a rotation with axisLand angle θ. Thenθ=2π/k, withk⩽deg(C)an integer.ProofFor any plane Π normal toL, a rotation aboutLinduces a rotation of the same angle on Π around the pointP:=L∩Π. But thenθ=2π/k, with k an integer that is at most the number of points in the intersectionC∩Π; however, this is at mostdeg(C)by definition of the degree of a nondegenerate irreducible curve. □Lemma 2LetC⊂R3be an irreducible space curve, invariant under two rotationsf1,f2with axesL1,L2. ThenL1,L2cannot be parallel.ProofSuppose thatL1,L2are parallel. Let Π be a plane normal toL1,L2that intersectsCin at least one point. The setC∩Πis invariant under both rotations. But if a set of planar points exhibits rotation symmetry, then the rotation center must be the barycenter of the points, implying thatL1=L2. □Proposition 3LetC⊂R3be a space curve different from a line or a circle. ThenCis invariant under at most:(i)one central inversion;finitely many rotation symmetries, whose axes are all concurrent;finitely many mirror symmetries, whose planes share a point.ProofThis result is known to hold whenCis degenerate (Lebmeir, 2009), so assume thatCis nondegenerate.(i) IfCis invariant under two central inversions with symmetry centersP1andP2, then it is invariant under their composition, which is a translation by2‖P1−P2‖along the directionP1P2(Coxeter, 1969, Section 7.3). SinceCis not a line, it cannot be invariant under a nontrivial translation, implying thatP1=P2.(ii) The composition of two rotations with axesL1,L2is: (a) when the axes are parallel, a rotation with axis parallel toL1,L2; (b) when the axes intersect, a rotation with axis passing throughL1∩L2; (c) when the axes are skew, a twist. We can discard the cases (a) (by Lemma 2) and (c).In the remaining case (b), ifCis invariant under three rotations with axes intersecting pairwise in three distinct points forming a plane Π, then the composition of any two rotations with axesL1,L2yields a rotation with axisLintersecting Π transversally in a point away from the third axisL3. But then the axesLandL3are skew, which is case (c) and cannot happen.Finally, suppose we have an infinite number of rotation axes{Li}meeting in a point P. The set of lines through P forms a real projective planeP2(R), which is compact. The points{Pi}⊂P2(R)corresponding to the axes{Li}will therefore have a point of accumulationP. Any neighborhood ofPwill contain an infinite number of points in{Pi}, corresponding to an infinite number of axes in{Li}. These axes meet in infinitely many distinct angles. The composition of two rotations with concurrent axes is another rotation, about an axis perpendicular to the concurrent rotation axes. If the rotations have rotation angles α, β and their axes meet with an angle Φ, then the composition is a rotation by an angle γ, where (Heard, 2006)cos(γ2)=cos(α2)⋅cos(β2)−sin(α2)⋅sin(β2)⋅cos(Φ).Since there are finitely many α, β by Lemma 1 but infinitely many angles Φ, we get infinitely many angles γ as well, therefore contradicting Lemma 1. We conclude thatChas at most finitely many rotation symmetries, whose axes are concurrent.(iii) The composition of two mirror symmetries with planesΠ1,Π2is: (a) if the planes are parallel, a translation; (b) if the planes intersect, a rotation aboutΠ1∩Π2making twice the angle as betweenΠ1,Π2. Case (a) can be discarded, so all mirror symmetries ofChave intersecting planes, and the statement follows in the case thatChas at most two mirror symmetries.SupposeChas at least three mirror symmetriesf1,f2,f3with corresponding planesΠ1,Π2,Π3. If these three planes intersect in a point at infinity, then any two pairs, say(Π1,Π2)and(Π1,Π3), intersect in parallel linesL:=Π1∩Π2andL′:=Π1∩Π3in the finite plane, which cannot happen by Lemma 2. It follows that the three planes intersect in a pointP:=Π1∩Π2∩Π3in the finite plane.Suppose there is a fourth mirror symmetryf4with planeΠ4not containing P. ThenΠ4intersectsΠ3in a certain lineL″. IfL″does not pass through P, thenChas rotation symmetries about the two skew axesLandL″. But thenCwould be invariant under their composition, which is a twist, and this cannot happen. SoΠ4also contains P and (iii) holds. □Corollary 4The number of symmetries of a plane or space curve, other than a line or a circle, is finite.The following theorem forms the foundation of our method. We need the definition of a Möbius transformation (on the affine real line), which is a rational function(3)φ:R⇢R,φ(t)=at+bct+d,Δ:=ad−bc≠0.In particular the identity map is a Möbius transformation, which we refer to as the trivial transformation.Theorem 5The curveCin(1)is invariant under a nontrivial symmetry f of the form(2)if and only if there exists a nontrivial Möbius transformation φ, with real coefficients a, b, c, d, such that(4)f(x(t))=x(φ(t)).Moreover, for any f there is a unique Möbius transformation φ satisfying(4).If there are two Möbius transformationsφ1,φ2satisfying (4), thenx(φ1)=x(φ2). Since x is proper, it follows thatφ1=φ2. For the first claim:“⟹”: Letx˜(t):=f(x(t)). Since x is proper,x−1is defined for all but finitely many values, andx−1∘x˜is a birational mapφ:=x˜−1∘xfrom the real line to itself. Any such map lifts to a birational automorphism of the complex projective lineP(C), which are known to be Möbius transformations (Sendra et al., 2008). It follows that φ takes the form (3) and is nontrivial because f is nontrivial. Moreover, since φ maps the real line to itself, we can assume that the coefficients ofφ(t)are real.“⟸”: Iff(x(t))=x(φ(t))for some nontrivial isometry f and nontrivial Möbius transformation φ, we observe thatx˜(t):=f(x(t))is an alternative parametrization ofC, and therefore thatCis invariant under f. □Eq. (4) relates the symmetries ofCto Möbius transformations in the parameter domain. We obtain the following lemma.Lemma 6Suppose an isometry f and Möbius transformation φ are related by(4). For any integer k, the compositionfk=idRnif and only ifφk=idR.Because x is proper, its inversex−1exists as a rational map, andφ=x−1∘f∘x. The result follows fromφk=(x−1∘f∘x)k=x−1∘fk∘x. □At this point one could in principle find the symmetries ofCby determining f and φ satisfying Eq. (4). However, the resulting polynomial system would involve too many variables in the coefficients of φ and f to be solved efficiently. In the following section we propose an efficient method to determine the symmetries ofC.To consider plane and space curves in one go, we embedR2intoR3as the plane of points with zero third component. The mappings onR2are lifted to mappings ofR3leaving the third component invariant.For technical reasons, we assume thatx(0)is well defined, and thatx′(0),x″(0)are also well defined, nonzero, and not parallel. Notice that this amounts to requiring that the curvatureκ(t):=‖x′(t)×x″(t)‖‖x′(t)‖3is well defined and nonzero att=0. Since this is the case for almost all parameters t, this condition holds after applying an appropriate, even random, linear affine change of the parameter t.Assume that the plane or space curveCin (1) is invariant under a nontrivial symmetryf(x)=Qx+b. By Theorem 5, there is a Möbius transformation φ satisfying (4). Our strategy will be to first, in Sections 3.1–3.5, express all unknown parameters in Q, b, and φ as rational functions of a single parameter b of φ. Substituting these rational functions into (4) and clearing denominators, one obtains three polynomials in t, whose coefficients are polynomials in b. For (4) to hold identically for all t, each of these polynomial coefficients must be zero, which happens if and only if their greatest common divisor vanishes. Removing from this polynomial all factors for which the Möbius transformation or symmetry is not defined or not invertible, one obtains a polynomialP(b)in which every real root corresponds to a symmetry.Let f be a plane rotation or an involution inR2orR3. Alternatively, let f be any isometry andCbe a Pythagorean-hodograph curve. We can now formulate the main theorem of the paper, which will be proved case-by-case in Sections 3.1–3.5.Theorem 7The curveChas a nontrivial symmetry f if and only ifP(b)has a real root b at which the parameters of Q,b, and φ are well defined.Each real root ofP(b)determines a Möbius transformation, which corresponds uniquely to a symmetry ofCby Theorem 5. By Corollary 4,Chas at most finitely many symmetries, implying thatP(b)cannot be identically zero.Finally, observe that one can directly find the symmetry type and its elements by analyzing the set of fixed points of the symmetryf(x)=Q(b)x+b(b). In particular,rank(Q(b)−I)is 1 for a symmetry with respect to a plane; 2 for a symmetry with respect to a line; 3 for a rotation symmetry or central inversion.Ifd=0, Eq. (4) becomesQx(t)+b=x(φ(t))=x(a˜/t+b˜),wherea˜:=b/candb˜:=a/c. Applying the change of variablest⟶1/tand writingx˜(t):=x(1/t), we obtain(5)Qx˜(t)+b=x(a˜t+b˜).Without loss of generality, we assume thatx˜(t)is well defined att=0and thatx˜′(0),x˜″(0)are well defined, nonzero, and not parallel. Evaluating (5) att=0yields(6)Qx˜(0)+b=x(b˜),while differentiating once and twice and evaluating att=0yields(7)Qx˜′(0)=x′(b˜)⋅a˜,Qx˜″(0)=x″(b˜)⋅a˜2.Taking inner products and using that Q is orthogonal, we get(8)a˜2=‖x˜′(0)‖2‖x′(b˜)‖2,a˜3=〈x˜′(0),x˜″(0)〉〈x′(b˜),x″(b˜)〉,from which we can writea˜as a rational function ofb˜,(9)a˜=‖x′(b˜)‖2‖x˜′(0)‖2⋅〈x˜′(0),x˜″(0)〉〈x′(b˜),x″(b˜)〉.A straightforward, but lengthy, calculation yields(10)(Ma)×(Mb)=det(M)M−T(a×b)for any invertible matrixM∈R3×3and vectors a,b∈R3. Taking the cross product in (7) and using that Q is orthogonal, one obtains(11)Q(x˜′(0)×x˜″(0))=det(Q)(x′(b˜)×x″(b˜))⋅a˜3.We analyze separately the casesn=2andn=3. Forn=2, (7) implies that multiplying Q by the matrixA:=[x˜′(0),x˜″(0)]gives the matrixB:=[x′(b˜)a˜,x″(b˜)a˜2]so thatQ=BA−1. Forn=3, multiplying Q by the matrixA:=[x˜′(0),x˜″(0),x˜′(0)×x˜″(0)]gives the matrixB:=[x′(b˜)a˜,x″(b˜)a˜2,det(Q)(x′(b˜)×x″(b˜))⋅a˜3]andQ=BA−1. One setsdet(Q)=1to find the direct transformations anddet(Q)=−1to find the opposite transformations. Substitutinga˜=a˜(b˜), one expresses Q as a matrix-valued rational function ofb˜. Finally from (6) one expresses b as a vector-valued rational function ofb˜.Ifd≠0, we may and will assumed=1after scaling the coefficients of φ if necessary. Differentiating (4) twice, we get(12)Qx′(t)=x′(φ(t))⋅φ′(t)=x′(at+bct+d)Δ(ct+d)2,(13)Qx″(t)=x″(φ(t))(φ′(t))2+x′(φ(t))φ″(t)=x″(at+bct+d)Δ2(ct+d)4−2x′(at+bct+d)cΔ(ct+d)3.Evaluating (12) and (13) att=0yields(14)Qx′(0)=x′(b)Δ,(15)Qx″(0)=x″(b)Δ2−2x′(b)cΔ.From (14), and using that Q is orthogonal, we can express(16)Δ2=‖x′(0)‖2‖x′(b)‖2solely in terms of b. Taking the cross product of (14), (15) and using again (10) and that Q is orthogonal, one obtains(17)Q(x′(0)×x″(0))=det(Q)⋅Δ3(x′(b)×x″(b)).Using (16) and taking norms, one reaches(18)‖x′(0)×x″(0)‖2‖x′(b)‖6−‖x′(0)‖6‖x′(b)×x″(b)‖2=0,which amounts toκ2(b)=κ2(0). If this equation does not have a real root, then we know thatCdoes not have any symmetry of any type. If it does, then we proceed to write Q in terms of b. By computing the dot product of (14), (15) and using that Q is orthogonal, we get(19)c=−〈x″(0),x′(0)〉2‖x′(0)‖2+Δ〈x″(b),x′(b)〉2‖x′(b)‖2.Next we consider separately involutions and plane rotations for which the corresponding Möbius transformation has parameterd=1.Assume thatf(x)=Qx+bis a nontrivial involution. Thenx=f2(x)=Q(Qx+b)+b=Q2x+(Q+I)b,x∈Rn,implying thatQ2=I. By Lemma 6,φ2=idR, implying that(a+d)b=0,(a+d)c=0, anda2=d2. Ifa+d≠0, thenb=c=0anda=d, and thereforeφ=idR, which contradicts thatf(x)is nontrivial. Thereforea=−d. So,Δ=−1−bc, and from (19) we can write(20)c=c(b)=−〈x′(b),x″(b)〉‖x′(0)‖2+〈x′(0),x″(0)〉‖x′(b)‖2‖x′(0)‖2(b〈x′(b),x″(b)〉+2‖x′(b)‖2)as a rational function of b.By changing the parametrization if necessary, we can determinec(b)by assuming that the numerator and denominator of the above fraction have no real root in common. Alternatively, we can take the gcd of the numerator and denominator and find the common real roots b, determine the correspondingΔ(b)from (16) by considering both signs separately, andc(b)fromΔ(b)=−1−b⋅c(b). Moreover, the denominator of this expression vanishes iff0=b〈x′(b),x″(b)〉+2‖x′(b)‖2=b2ddb‖x′(b)‖2+2‖x′(b)‖2,which happens precisely when‖x′(b)‖2=M/b4, with M a nonzero constant. However, in that casex′(0)is not defined, which contradicts one of our initial assumptions. Hence, the above expression forc(b)is well defined.Once the rational functionsΔ=Δ(b)andc=c(b)are obtained, the matrixQ=Q(b)can again be determined from its action onx′(0),x″(0), andx′(0)×x″(0), which is given by Eqs. (14), (15), and (17). One findsb(b)from evaluating (4) att=0.In order to detect rotation symmetries in the plane, we identify the Euclidean plane with the complex plane as(x1,x2)≃x1+x2i. Thus the parametrizationx=(x1,x2)in (1) yields a parametrizationz:R⇢C⊂C,z(t)=x1(t)+x2(t)i,where we denoted the curve by the same symbolC. Writingz0for the rotation center and θ for the rotation angle, Eq. (4) takes the form(21)z(φ(t))=z0+eiθ⋅(z(t)−z0).Differentiating this expression we obtain(22)z′(φ(t))⋅Δ(ct+d)2=eiθ⋅z′(t).Without loss of generality, we assume thatz(t)is well defined att=0andz′(0)≠0, so that evaluating (21) and (22) att=0gives(23)eiθ=Δz′(b)z′(0),z0=z(b)−eθiz(0)1−eθi,expressing the symmetry in terms of the Möbius transformation. Differentiating (22), evaluating att=0, and solving for c, we deduce(24)c=12[z″(b)z′(b)Δ−z″(0)z′(0)].Since all coefficients of φ are real, the imaginary part of the above expression for c must be zero, which yields rational expressionsΔ=Δ(b),c=c(b), and therefore alsoa=a(b)=Δ(b)+b⋅c(b). The symmetry itself is determined from (23).Some rotation symmetries of space curves are found by the previous algorithms. Since axial symmetries are involutions, these rotations will be found directly by the method of Section 3.3. By the Cartan–Dieudonné Theorem, any rotation f inR3is the composition of three reflectionsf1,f2,f3. However, if our curveChas a rotation symmetry f, then these reflectionsf1,f2,f3need not be mirror symmetries of our curve. Taking compositions of the reflections found in Section 3.3 will therefore only yield some of the rotations ofC. In addition, the rotations whose corresponding Möbius transformation have parameterd=0will be found by the method of Section 3.1.Unfortunately it seems that the approach of the previous section cannot be generalized to find all rotations of space curves. The complex numbers in the plane can be replaced by quaternions (Farouki, 2008; Goldman, 2010) in space, which provides a convenient way to express rotations. For instance, one can give quaternion versions of (12) and (13). The difficulty, however, comes from the fact that quaternions are not commutative, which makes it hard to eliminate the parameters defining the rotation in the resulting equations. Because of this, we have not been able to prove a version of Theorem 7 for space rotations. In fact, we are uncertain whether it is possible in that case to write all parameters of the Möbius transformation as rational functions of just one of them. While we might write these parameters in terms of two of them, which would yield a bivariate polynomial system, we feel that this solution is not satisfactory computationally. We therefore pose the question here as a pending problem.However, if the curveCfrom (1) is a Pythagorean-hodograph curve, i.e., if there exists a rational functionσ(t)such that‖x′(t)‖2=x1′2(t)+x2′2(t)+⋯+xn′2(t)=σ2(t),then we do not run into the same obstacle. Such curves form an important topic in Computer Aided Geometric Design, and they have been studied extensively both from the point of view of theory and of applications (Farouki, 2008). In this case we can determine all rotation symmetries, since (16) gives a rational functionΔ(b)=±‖x′(0)‖/σ(b), from which we find a rational functionc(b)by (19), and finally a rational functiona(b)=Δ(b)+b⋅c(b). After this we determine the symmetry as before. The sign ofΔ(b)is not easily determined in advance, so it is necessary to carry out the algorithm for both cases.For all but the simplest examples, the computations quickly become too large to be carried out by hand, and a computer algebra system is needed. We have therefore implemented and tested the algorithms in Sage (Stein and et al., 2013). The resulting worksheet with implementations and examples can be downloaded from the website of the third author (Muntingh, 2014).LetCbe the deltoid from Fig. 1(a), defined parametrically as the image of the mapz:R⟶C,(25)z(t)=−t4+4t3−12t2+16t−4t4−4t3+8t2−8t+4+8t3−24t2+24t−8t4−4t3+8t2−8t+4i.We follow the recipe from Section 3.4 to find its rotations. This parametrization is well defined att=0and satisfiesz′(0)≠0. Using that the imaginary part of (24) is zero, we findΔ(b)=12b2−b+1,c(b)=b(2b3−3b2−18b+22)4(b2−2b−2)(1−b),a(b)=7b4−34b3+30b2+8b−84(1−b)(b2−2b−2).The symmetry is determined by (23), as(26)eθi(b)=−(b−1)(b2−2b−2)(b2−2b+2)2(b−2+bi),(27)z0(b)=−3b2−6b+6(5b4−32b3+72b2−64b+20)(b2−4b+2+2(b−2)(b−1)i).Substituting these expressions into (21) yields a rational function in t, whose coefficients are polynomials in b. This rational function is identically zero if and only if the gcdb(b−1)(b2−2b−2)(b2−6b+6)of the coefficients in the numerator is zero. Removing all factors for which either the Möbius transformation or the symmetry is not defined or not invertible, we obtain a polynomialP(b)=b(b2−6b+6). Substituting its three real zerosb=0,3±3into (26), (27) we find rotations aboutz0=0with anglesθ=0,2π/3,4π/3. There are no additional symmetries for the cased=0.LetCbe the twisted cubic, defined parametrically as the image of the map(28)x:R⟶C⊂R3,t⟼(1t+1,1(t+1)2,1(t+1)3).From (20) and using thatΔ=−1−bcwe findc(b)=(b+2)(25b4+89b3+228b2+262b+350)14(b4+2b3+6b2+b+14),Δ(b)=−(b+1)(25b+14)(b4+4b3+10b2+12b+14)14(b4+2b3+6b2+b+14).One obtainsQ(b)from (14), (15), and (17) andb(b)from evaluating (4) att=0. SubstitutingQ(b),b(b), andc(b)into (4), one finds that the coefficients of the powers of t in the numerator have gcd(b+2)(25b+14)(b4+4b3+10b2+12b+14)for direct transformations and(25b+14)(b4+4b3+10b2+12b+14)for opposite transformations. Since the Möbius transformation is invertible,Δ(b)is nonzero and there is only one relevant factorP(b)=b+2for the direct transformations. Substitutingb=−2intoΔ(b),b(b), andc(b), one finds the Möbius transformationφ(t)=−t−2with corresponding axial symmetryf(x)=Qx+b,Q=[−10001000−1],b=[000].This symmetry is depicted in Fig. 1(b) by connecting corresponding points by lines. There are no additional symmetries for the cased=0.We test the performance of the algorithms in Section 3 for several classical curves on a Dell XPS 15 laptop, with 2.4 GHz i5-2430M processor and 6 GB RAM. Additional technical details are provided in the Sage worksheet (Muntingh, 2014).For each curve, Tables 1 and 2list the degree, a standard parametrization, a reparametrizationu(t)that brings this curve into general position, the number#rotand#invof (nontrivial) rotations and involutions found, and the average CPU timestrotandtinv(seconds) of the computations. In each case the algorithm for finding rotations performs better than the algorithm for finding involutions. The curves “inversion 1” and “inversion 2” are constructed to have precisely one central inversion.Note that the algorithm for finding involutions of space curves performs significantly worse for the crunode in Table 2 than for the other curves of degree four. The reason seems to be that, besides the degree of a parametrization, the sizes of the coefficients greatly influence the performance of the algorithms. Even rational numbers with relatively small numerator and denominator get blown up by simple arithmetic operations. This is a common problem when computing in exact arithmetic.Most of the computation time is spent by substituting the symmetry and Möbius transformation in (4) and finding the polynomial conditions on the parameter b.
