The advantage of simple paper abstracts

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We investigate whether or not the style of a scientific paper's abstract bears any relation to the number of times that paper is cited.We find that papers whose abstracts contain more frequently used words tend to receive slightly more citations.We find that journals which publish papers whose abstracts are shorter and contain more frequently used words receive slightly more citations per paper.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Each year, researchers publish an immense number of scientific papers. While some receive many citations, others receive none. Here we investigate whether any of this variance can be explained by the choice of words in a paper's abstract. We find that doubling the word frequency of an average abstract increases citations by 0.70%. We also find that journals which publish papers whose abstracts are shorter and contain more frequently used words receive slightly more citations per paper. Specifically, adding a 5 letter word to an abstract decreases the number of citations by 0.02%. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the style in which a paper's abstract is written bears some relation to its scientific impact.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Written communication is now being recorded online on a colossal scale (Conte et al., 2012; King, 2011; Lazer et al., 2009; Michel et al., 2011; Moat, Preis, Olivola, Liu, & Chater, 2014; Petersen, Tenenbaum, Havlin, & Stanley, 2012; Petersen, Tenenbaum, Havlin, Stanley, & Perc, 2012; Watts, 2007). The datasets left behind offer unprecedented insight into how information flows between humans. Recent studies have attempted to link data on information exchanged online to data on actions taken in the real world, considering sources such as Google (Curme, Preis, Stanley, & Moat, 2014; Preis & Moat, 2014; Preis, Moat, & Stanley, 2013; Preis, Moat, Stanley, & Bishop, 2012), Wikipedia (Kristoufek, 2013; Mestyán, Yasseri, & Kertész, 2013; Moat et al., 2013; Yasseri, Sumi, Rung, Kornai, & Kertész, 2012), online news (Alanyali, Moat, & Preis, 2013), and Twitter (Bollen, Mao, & Zeng, 2011; Ciulla et al., 2012; Gonçalves, Perra, & Vespignani, 2011; Mocanu et al., 2013). In this paper, we focus on the communication of scientific findings in journals and papers. We investigate whether the way in which these findings are communicated in the abstract bears any relationship to the number of times other scientists cite the paper.Online services such as Web of Science provide access to vast collections of scientific papers. These services also track the number of times each paper is cited as a measure of impact. Here, we define a successful paper as one that has received a greater number of citations. Recently, advances have been made in quantifying scientific output based on publication statistics, offering remarkable insight into academic conversation (Hartley, 2005, 2007; Laurance, Useche, Laurance, & Bradshaw, 2013; Letchford, Moat, & Preis, 2015; Lewison & Hartley, 2005; Penner, Pan, Petersen, Kaski, & Fortunato, 2013; Petersen & Penner, 2014; Petersen, Stanley, & Succi, 2011; Petersen & Succi, 2013; Petersen, Wang, & Stanley, 2010; Soler, 2007; van Dijk, Manor, & Carey, 2014; Yogatama et al., 2011). For example, recent analyses have indicated that a paper's success can be partially predicted by its early success (Acuna, Allesina, & Kording, 2012; Hirsch, 2007; Wang, Song, & Barabasi, 2013) as well as the reputation of the authors (Petersen et al., 2014).Here, we focus on whether or not the style in which a paper is written may relate to its success. For example, some paper titles include a question mark (Jamali & Nikzad, 2011) or other non-alphanumeric characters (Buter & van Raan, 2011) where inclusion of these characters has been linked to fewer citations. Not all of these results are reproducible across different samples of papers. For example, one analysis suggested that papers with a colon in their title tend to receive fewer citations (Jamali & Nikzad, 2011) and another analysis concludes the opposite (Jacques & Sebire, 2009). These studies use samples of 2,172 and 50 papers respectively. While we have previously analysed the relationship between paper title characteristics and citation rates (Letchford et al., 2015), here we focus on characteristics of a paper's abstract.In this paper, we use a sample of 300,000 papers across all disciplines to investigate whether or not the style in which a paper's abstract is written may relate to its success. A previous analysis of a sample of 196 papers concluded that the length of an abstract is not indicative of the number of times the paper is cited (Falagas, Zarkali, Karageorgopoulos, Bardakas, & Mavros, 2013). A recent larger scale study however provided contradictory evidence, suggesting that papers with longer abstracts attract more citations (Weinberger, Evans, & Allesina, 2015). This same study also found that using simpler words in an abstract resulted in fewer citations for the paper.However, in the light of evidence from psychological experiments, this finding might be considered surprising. In an experiment called the lexical decision task, participants attempt to classify sequences of characters as real or nonsense words. Studies have found that the frequency of words is a very influential factor in determining participant's response speed (Whaley, 1978). In this same task, longer words have also been shown to lead to longer response times (New, Ferrand, Pallier, & Brysbaert, 2006). These experiments suggest that the length and frequency of words may provide at least a crude measure of how easy they are to understand. We hypothesise that if comprehending a paper's abstract requires a higher cognitive load, due to uncommon words and lengthy prose, then the paper may not receive as many citations.
