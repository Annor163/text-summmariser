@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The stock selection problem is one of the major issues in the investment industry, which is mainly solved by analyzing financial ratios. However, considering the complexity and imprecise patterns of the stock market, obvious and easy-to-understand investment rules, based on fundamental analysis, are difficult to obtain. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a combined soft computing model for tackling the value stock selection problem, which includes dominance-based rough set approach, formal concept analysis, and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique. The objectives of the proposed approach are to (1) obtain easy-to-understand decision rules, (2) identify the core attributes that may distinguish value stocks, (3) explore the cause–effect relationships among the attributes or criteria in the strong decision rules to gain more insights. To examine and illustrate the proposed model, this study used a group of IT stocks in Taiwan as an empirical case. The findings contribute to the in-depth understanding of the value stock selection problem in practice.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we propose a combined soft computing model for value stock selection that is based on financial ratio analysis, also termed “fundamental analysis” (FA). The stock selection problem can be traced back to the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) [1], which assumes that investors cannot use available information to form an investing strategy for consistently outperforming the stock market. In the hope of finding a useful strategy, researchers have used various investment plans to examine the EMH [2–4]. Among those investing strategies, value investing is widely examined in academia and in practice [5]; it originated from the classical work of Graham and Dodd [6]. Value investing strategy is based on the idea that out-of-favor stocks are sometimes underpriced because of the inefficiency of the stock market. Smart investors may earn extra premium by investing in these underpriced stocks. In finance, researchers often classify stocks that have high book-to-market equity (B/M) or earnings-to-price (E/P) ratios as value stocks [7]; the value premium has been discovered in many markets [2,3,7–9]. Though the essential idea of value investing is generally accepted, further selection among a group of generic high B/M or E/P ratio stocks is a challenging task. In practice, the evaluation of the worthiness and prospect of a value stock mainly relies on FA [10,11]. Although the use of relevant financial variables to assess the prospect of a stock is widely adopted, opinions on the inclusion of information and analyzing methods are divided.The stock selection problem is solved using two main approaches. In the conventional approach, financial studies tend to use regression models for determining the relationship among historical financial ratios and future earnings (or stock performance). To examine the usefulness of a value investing strategy, Piotroski [9] included nine financial variables from three aspects to discriminate winners and losers by forming a logit-regression model (F-Score model). Similarly, Mohanram [12] developed a G-Score model for selecting glamor stocks. Both the F- and G-Score models obtained positive results in their proposed experimental periods. The aforementioned studies mainly used regression models, which might be suitable for explaining some phenomenon; nevertheless, the complexity and nonlinear relationships among financial ratios and the subsequent stock returns often impede practitioners in determining useful investing rules in a specific context [13].In addition, in the nonconventional approach, researchers from other fields, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) have attempted to leverage the computational strength of computer programming to solve the complex stock selection problem. Among various AI techniques, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widely used to predict stock performance because of their superior capability to model a nonlinear relationship. For instance, Lam [10] combined the fundamental and technical variables in the ANN model to predict financial performance. Recent studies have proposed an integration approach for enhancing the learning capability of the ANN model. For example, Hadavandi et al. [14] integrated the genetic fuzzy system with ANN to forecast stock prices. Hsu [15] used a hybrid approach to combine ANN with genetic programming. Although the aforementioned studies generated positive outcomes from their models, drawing useful conclusions for future investment from the learning results of ANNs is often difficult. The black-box processing characteristic of ANN and support vector machine (SVM) [16] impedes investors in understanding the complex relationship among the considered variables of each model. In another nonconventional approach, MCDM considers multiple criteria for tackling the complex stock rankings and selection problem. The group decision methods—analytic network process (ANP) and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)—were used for retrieving experts’ domain knowledge regarding investment practice [13,17]. The obtained results hinged on the experts’ subjective judgments. Each experts provided his opinions (by questionnaire) to incorporate his knowledge into the model. Another main method in the MCDM is the data envelope analysis (DEA) that uses mathematical programming to gauge the efficiency of the considered stocks [18,19]. Although the DEA method is useful for portfolio selection, it cannot explore the relationships among financial variables.As discussed, existing studies (i.e., statistics and certain AI techniques) have limitations in exploring the complex relationships among financial variables to induct applicable knowledge of value stocks. Therefore, the major motivation of this study was to devise a model that may relax the unrealistic assumptions of statistics and tackle the vague and imprecise financial data to obtain understandable knowledge or implications for value stock selection. As a result, this paper proposes a combined soft computing model by using the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA), formal concept analysis (FCA), and DEMATEL techniques, to obtain applicable knowledge for this problem. The conceptual framework of this study is illustrated in Fig. 1; in addition, the purpose and advantages of the proposed approach (compared with previous techniques, such as statistics, ANNs, and SVM) are highlighted.The key parts of the proposed approach are discussed as below. First, the DRSA classifier reduces the considered criteria (i.e., obtained CORE criteria) and generates a set of decision rules to select value stocks with strong prospects. Compared with the AI techniques (e.g., ANNs and SVM), DRSA may generate a set of decision rules for investors to comprehend (instead of a black-box). In addition, DRSA may consider partial sets of criteria in each context (i.e., decision rule), which is closer to how domain experts make judgments (ANNs, DEA, or SVM must process all input variables simultaneously to adjust their parameters during the learning phase); it is difficult for a human brain to make decisions based on all criteria in each time [20]. In addition, DRSA does not have to assume the distribution of data or the independence of variables. Second, the FCA is incorporated to induct the plausible symptoms that may satisfy the premises in the DRSA decision rules. This deepens the understanding of decision rules obtained from objectively inducted implications, which may enhance the findings from DRSA. Furthermore, the CORE criteria from the DRSA model could be analyzed using the DEMATEL technique, which may leverage domain experts’ knowledge to identify cause–effect relationships (directional influences) among the CORE dimensions (criteria). Last, the obtained symptoms and source criteria of decision rules from FCA and DEMATEL analyses may complement each other to support the result. These findings along with the strong DRSA decision rules, could be illustrated as a directional flow graph (DFG) for enhancing the understanding of value stock investment in practice. The proposed approach not only supports the identification of value stocks with superior prospects, but also aims at retrieving understandable implications for investors, which have been underexplored in previous studies.To illustrate the proposed approach, Taiwan's stock market was examined as an empirical case. The stock market was regarded as a “big data set,” composed of more than 1400 stocks and numerous financial attributes. Inducting effective and critical patterns from the big data set is a challenging yet valuable task. The proposed soft computing model intends to explore or retrieve the effective patterns from the stock market with easy-to-understand decision rules for supporting the value stock selection problem.The remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. Section 2 gives a short review of FA and discusses the proposed DRSA, FCA, and DEMATEL techniques. Section 3 introduces the DRSA methodology and the FCA. In Section 4 the proposed method is used to explore Taiwan's stock market as an empirical case with an experimental result. Section 5 discusses the result, and Section 6 concludes this paper.This section reviews studies related to value investing strategy and FA. In addition, the proposed DRSA, FCA, and DEMATEL techniques are briefly discussed. Furthermore, the reason for using the DRSA method for solving the value stock selection problem is explained.Empirical studies have used various investing strategies to examine the efficiency of the market. The value investing strategy is widespread in both practice and academia. Value investing is widely used in practice because of the accomplishments of the world class investor Warren Buffett [21] (by Schroeder). In the financial literature, researchers have often classified stocks with high B/M or E/P ratios as value stocks. The value premium suggests that a portfolio composed of high B/M stocks often outperforms a group of low B/M stocks or market indices [22,23]. This has been examined in many markets with confirmed results [3,7,23,24]. Nevertheless, to conduct value investing for making decisions, selecting among a group of generic high B/M stocks is required. The selection and evaluation of a stock mainly relies on analyzing the financial information from financial statements. The use of FA can help in several domains, such as providing information to creditors or suppliers, evaluating competitive positions of rivals, and projecting the future stock performance for existing or potential investors [25]. Although the use of FA by analyzing financial ratios is a common practice, the decisions of including which variables and modeling methods are still divided. Delen et al. [26] used 31 ratios in their model. To examine the value investing strategy, Piotroski [9] presented the F-Score model, and included nine variables from three aspects to differentiate expected winners and losers. The research mainly relied on regression models to capture the relationship among financial ratios and the subsequent stock returns; therefore, in practice, the financial variables were presumed to be independent, not realistic [27]. A model with a less strict assumption is required for exploring the relationship of the considered financial criteria to guide the value stock selection problem.Various methods are available that may retrieve knowledge from a large-scale data set, such as the fuzzy information system (FIS), ANN, SVM, and rough set approach (RSA). The classical RSA was proposed by Pawlak [28], in an attempt to tackle the indiscernibility and ambiguity of complex data sets. Although the classical RSA achieved major success in discovering useful knowledge in various applications—such as personal investment portfolio analysis [29], prediction of financial distress and credit assessment decision—the RSA was constrained in dealing with the non-ordered data of the classification problems [30]. However, in practice, many problems require handling of data by using preference-ordered attributes. For example, for the credit risk detection problem, a company with lower debt ratio is usually preferred. Therefore, certain extended RSA models were proposed to examine the ordering relation between attribute values, such as Tolerance Rough Sets (TRS) [31,32] and DRSA. The TRS model proposed an uncertainty function to define the level of tolerance for attributes and recognize two objects as indiscernible if the difference in their attributes was below a predefined tolerance level. This approach has the advantage of searching for the optimized approximation of concepts (attributes/criteria); however, determining an ideal tolerance level for attributes (also the subsets of combination of attributes) for a model would require intensive experiments, and the complexity would increase rapidly if the number of attributes in a model was large. By contrast, to focus on the preference relation, DRSA mainly preserves the dominance relation of attribute values and attempts to discover implicit knowledge of multiple attributes. Developed by Greco et al. [33], DRSA has been widely used for resolving various decision problems, such as finding the customers’ preference in the airline industry [34], obtaining marketing guidance for customer relationship management [35], and diagnosing the financial performance of commercial banks [36]. The DRSA method is regarded as a knowledge discovering system. The assumption of independence among variables (attributes) is not required, and the probability distribution of data set is not to be assumed. Compared with the classical RSA, the main advantage of the DRSA is the capability of deriving “ifantecedent, thenconsequent” decision rules. The stock selection problem based on FA has multiple dimensions and pertaining financial indicators. In practice, financial variables often have relations, and traditional regression models are insufficient to model the complex relations of financial attributes without the assumption of independencies among the considered criteria [27]. The DRSA method may overcome this obstacle with the capability to obtain decision rules. To find practical and useful decision rules for investment, we used the DRSA method for initially solving the value stock selection problem. In this section, the general concept of the DRSA was introduced; in addition, the reason for its use in this study was discussed. For more in-depth theoretical foundations of the DRSA, refer to [33,37–40].The FCA is regarded as a mathematical theory [41] that clarifies the formalization of concepts and conceptual thinking. According to the survey by Poelmans et al. [42], the major applications of the FCA include software engineering, knowledge discovery, and information retrieval. The financial application of FCA has gained relatively little attention. Previous studies that combined RSA with FCA have emphasized the selection among a group of decision rules generated from the RSA analysis [43]. However, FCA was used in this study to explore the relationship among the involved main criteria by analyzing the value stocks (objects) included in the strong decision rules. The constructed lattice diagram from FCA can generate hierarchical classification and obtain subconcept–superconcept relations among the involved financial attributes. The results may enrich the implications obtained using the DRSA method.The DEMATEL technique [44], which belongs to the MCDM approach was proposed for tackling complex decision problems. This technique has been applied to explore various business problems, such as vendor [45] and portfolio selection problems [46]. The strength of the DEMATEL technique is to discover the directional influence relationships among the considered dimensions and criteria. The technique's strength was leveraged to enhance the findings in this study. The involved steps for calculation are illustrated in Appendix A, range from how to collect opinions from experts (Step 1) to forming directional influences among the dimensions and criteria (Step 4).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This study used the combined soft computing model to explore the usefulness of FA in selecting satisfactory value stocks. The three major contributions of this study are summarized as follows: (1) Identify the contexts (decision rules) and core criteria to discern value stocks with satisfactory prospects; (2) Explore the cause–effect relationships among the CORE attributes (by using the DEMATEL technique), which enables investors to observe the source factors (from FCA) that might improve or deteriorate the future prospects of value stocks; (3) Illustrate the proposed approach with clearly defined steps and operational procedures, which may help practitioners understand how to leverage advanced soft computing and MCDM techniques to solve real world problems in finance.Taiwan's stock market comprises more than 1400 stocks and numerous financial attributes. The complex relationship among the financial attributes and future stock returns is unlikely to be solved using linear models, such as the regressions. However, the proposed DRSA model can explore the vague and imprecise patterns without the unrealistic assumptions of conventional regressions (i.e., the independence of the considered variables, and the linear relationship among the dependent and the independent variables). By adopting the proposed approach, the value stocks with satisfactory prospects could be identified, which is valuable for supporting investments in practice. Furthermore, the findings from FCA (inducted from historical data) and DEMATEL (retrieved from experts) techniques suggest that Operational Efficiency (D3) is the source dimension that would influence the prospects of value stocks. Investors may observe the changes in related criteria (i.e., DAYs and AssetTurnover) before or after the investment of value stocks, and make corresponding adjustments in their portfolio. Aside from investors, the management teams of high B/M stocks may learn the plausible influences among the CORE criteria, regarding how the capital market evaluates value stocks, and improve their underperformed criteria on the basis of the implications obtained from DRSA (Table 5), FCA (Table 10), INRM (Fig. 7), and DFG (Fig. 8). The obtained findings thus contribute to the understanding of value stock selection and stock performance improvement in finance.Despite the advantages of the DRSA method, the proposed model has limitations. First, the developed model used previous financial information for obtaining a decision result in the following period. Only one-period-ahead financial ratios and growth rate ratios were used to induct decision rules and classify decision classes. The model only reflected recent two years’ fundamentals to capture future stock performance. Second, the result was influenced by the discretization method. We divided each criterion into three states (low, mid, and high; or 1, 2, and 3), which limited the size of the granule of knowledge. The extent to which a criterion can be discretized to gain higher accuracy was not determined in this study. Future research may incorporate other soft computing techniques or statistical methods for enhancing the model. Another interesting and underexplored research direction is the performance improvement of value stocks. As companies are constrained by limited resources (e.g., monetary and human capital), allocating resources and budgets to yield an optimal effect (i.e., improve performance of value stocks) could be considered in the context of multiple objective decision making (MODM) in the future.Developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute of Geneva [48], DEMATEL was proposed to explore complex social problems, in which dimensions/criteria were assumed to be fully interrelated. As the variables/criteria of social problems are often interrelated, the DEMATEL technique is suitable to identity the influential relationships among criteria, which has been adopted in various applications, such as financial performance diagnoses [36], smartphone improvement [52], and select suppliers in a green supply chain [53]. In this study, DEMATEL technique is adopted to explore the cause–effect relationships among the CORE criteria; the obtained findings may support investors to observe the changes of source criterion/criteria to foresee the prospect of value stocks. The required steps are explained as below, and the details can be found in the previous works [44–46,52,53].Step 1:Using questionnaire to collect the initial average relation matrix A. Experts are asked to judge the influence degree that they feel attribute/criterion i will have on attribute/criterion j, indicated as aij. The rating scale ranges from 4 (very high influence) to 0 (no influence). The initial average matrix takes the arithmetic mean of the respondents’ feedbacks for forming the initial average matrixA, and the matrixAis shown in Eq. (A.1). The opinions collected from the eight experts are organized in Table A.1.(A.1)A=a11⋯a1j⋯a1n⋮⋮⋮ai1⋯aij⋯ain⋮⋮⋮an1⋯anj⋯ann(In the following tables, {C1, C2, C3, C4} denote {G1, G2, G3, G4}; C5 denotes S1; {C6, C7} denote {E1, E2} for the empirical case)Normalize the initial average relation matrix A for obtaining the direct-influence matrix D. The matrixD=[dij]n×ncan be derived by Eqs. (A.2) and (A.3) as below. The initial average relation matrix A and the direct-influence matrix D of the empirical case are shown in Tables A.2 and A.3respectively.(A.2)D=pA(A.3)p=min1maxi∑j=1naij,1maxj∑i=1naij,i,j∈1,2,…,nTransform the normalized direct-influence matrix D into the total-influence relation matrix T. The total-influence relation matrixTfor forming influential network relationship map (INRM) can be obtained by multiplying the inverse of (I−D) withD, as the Eq. (A.4). In the equation,Idenotes the identity matrix. (I−D) and the inverse of (I−D) are shown in Tables A.4 and A.5. In addition, the total-influence relation matrixTand the dimensional influence relation matrixTDof the empirical case are in Tables A.6 and A.7.(A.4)T=D+D2+⋯+Dw=D(I−Dw)(I−D)−1thus, whenw→∞,Dw=[0]n×n(A.5)T=D(I−D)−1=[tij]n×n,Decomposing the total-influence relation matrix for finding the directional influences among the criteria. The sum of rows and the sum of columns of the total-influence relation matrixTare expressed as the row vectorr=r1,…,ri,…,rnand the row vectorc=c1,…,cj,…,cn(i.e., sum of columns) respectively. The vectorrand vectorchave the same number of elements; thus, the operations ofr+candr−cwill form two row vectors, as Eqs. (A.6) and (A.7).(A.6)r+c=r1+c1,…,ri+ci,…,rn+cn,i∈1,2,…,n(A.7)r−c=r1−c1,…,ri−ci,…,rn−cn,i∈1,2,…,nIn Eq. (A.6), the ith element of the row vectorr+cindicates the importance of the ith criterion. Besides, the row vectorr−cin Eq. (A.7) separates criteria into the cause group and the effect group. In general, if the element ri−ciis positive, the ith criterion belongs to the cause group; otherwise, the ith criterion belongs to the effect group. In analogy to the decomposition of the criteria, the dimensions can also be divided into the cause group and the effect group. The dimensional influences and criteria influences of the empirical case are in Tables 8 and 9, respectively.The decision rules listed below were obtained by using the whole training set; the antecedents of a decision rule are on the left side, and the corresponding consequence the right side. Take Rule 1 for example, it may be interpreted as “if DAYs (i.e., average days for sales)≤1, then HPR (i.e., decision attribute) of a value stock should be classified at least as G (i.e., Good)”. The explanation of symbols (criteria) in these decision rules can be found in Table 1.1.(DAYs≤1)=>(HPR≥G)(ΔTotalAsset≥2) & (DEBT≤2) & (AssetTurnover≥3) & (DAYs≤2)⇒(HPR≥G)(CASH≥2) & (ΔGrossProfit≥3) & (ΔTotalAsset≥3) & (AssetTurnover≥2)⇒(HPR≥G)(DEBT≤1) & (AssetTurnover≥2) & (InvTurnover≥3)⇒(HPR≥G)(ΔREV≥3) & (ΔROA≥2) & (AssetTurnover≥2) & (DAYs≤2)⇒(HPR≥G)(OProfit≥3) & (ΔROA≥3) & (InvTurnover≥2) & (DAYs <= 2)⇒(HPR≥G)(ΔREV≥3) & (ΔROA≥3) & (DAYs≤2)⇒(HPR≥G)(ΔTotalAsset≥3) & (ΔROA≥3) & (DEBT≤1) & (DAYs≤2)⇒(HPR≥G)(ΔREV≥3) & (ΔGrossProfit≥2) & (ΔROA≥2) & (LIQUID≥3) & (DAYs≤2)⇒(HPR≥G)(DAYs≥3)⇒(HPR≤B)(ROA≤1) & (OGrossProfit≤2)⇒(HPR≤B)(ΔROA≤1) & (AssetTurnover≤2)⇒(HPR≤B)(OProfit≤2) & (ΔREV≤1) & (AssetTurnover≤1)⇒(HPR≤B)(OProfit≤2) & (ΔROA≤2) & (AssetTurnover≤1) & (InvTurnover≤2)⇒(HPR≤B)(CASH≤2) & (ΔROA≤2) & (AssetTurnover≤1)⇒(HPR≤B)(ΔGrossProfit≤1) & (ΔROA≤2) & (AssetTurnover≤1) & (DAYs≥2)⇒(HPR≤B)(ΔREV≤1) & (InvTurnover≤1)⇒(HPR≤B)(OGrossProfit≤2) & (ΔTotalAsset≤1) & (ΔROA≤2) & (InvTurnover≤2) & (DAYs≥2)⇒(HPR≤B)(ΔREV≤2) & (ΔROA≤2) & (LIQUID≤2) & (DEBT≥2)⇒(HPR≤B)(ΔNPAT≤1) & (DEBT >= 3)⇒(HPR≤B)The association rules in below were obtained by FCA analysis, which denote the matching percentage between the subconcept and superconcept. The symbols used in these rules include the status of each criterion; take the third rule for example, Debt_L denotes that the state of criterion DEBT is “Low (categorized as “1” in DRSA model)”. On the left side, “<10>” means that there were 10 observations (alternatives) that hold the subconcept “low DEBT”; whereas, on the right side, “<9>” indicates that 9 of the 10 observations also hold the superconcept “high AssetTurnover”; the matching percentage is thus 90% (9/10=90%).1.<11> InvSaleD_L=[91%]⇒<10> AssetTurn_H;<10> Debt_L=[90%]⇒<9> InvSaleD_L;<10> Debt_L=[90%]⇒<9> AssetTurn_H;<11> InvSaleD_L=[82%]⇒<9> Debt_L;<9> Debt_L InvSaleD_L=[89%]⇒<8> AssetTurn_H;<6> RevG_L=[100%]⇒<6> AssetTurn_H;<7> DROA_H=[86%]⇒<6> AssetTurn_H;<5> RevG_L Debt_L AssetTurn_H=[100%]⇒<5> InvSaleD_L;<5> RevG_L AssetTurn_H InvSaleD_L=[100%]⇒<5> Debt_L;<5> DTAsset_L=[100%]⇒<5> RevG_H;<5> DTAsset_H Debt_L=[100%]⇒<5> InvSaleD_L;<5> DTAsset_H AssetTurn_H=[100%]⇒<5> InvSaleD_L;<5> DROA_H Debt_L=[100%]⇒<5> AssetTurn_H;<6> InvSaleD_M=[83%]⇒<5> RevG_H;<6> DTAsset_H InvSaleD_L=[83%]⇒<5> AssetTurn_H;<6> DTAsset_H InvSaleD_L=[83%]⇒<5> Debt_L;<6> DROA_H AssetTurn_H=[83%]⇒<5> Debt_L;<6> RevG_L AssetTurn_H=[83%]⇒<5> Debt_L InvSaleD_L;<4> RevG_H DTAsset_L DROA_H=[100%]⇒<4> AssetTurn_H;<4> RevG_H DTAsset_L AssetTurn_H=[100%]⇒<4> DROA_H;<4> RevG_H DROA_H AssetTurn_H=[100%]⇒<4> DTAsset_L;<4> DTAsset_M=[100%]⇒<4> AssetTurn_H;<4> DROA_M AssetTurn_H=[100%]⇒<4> InvSaleD_L;<4> DROA_H InvSaleD_L=[100%]⇒<4> Debt_L AssetTurn_H;<4> AssetTurn_M=[100%]⇒<4> RevG_H;<5> DTAsset_H AssetTurn_H InvSaleD_L=[80%]⇒<4> Debt_L;<5> DROA_M InvSaleD_L=[80%]⇒<4> AssetTurn_H;<5> DROA_M InvSaleD_L=[80%]⇒<4> DTAsset_H;<5> RevG_H InvSaleD_L=[80%]⇒<4> AssetTurn_H;<5> RevG_H InvSaleD_L=[80%]⇒<4> Debt_L;<5> DROA_H Debt_L AssetTurn_H=[80%]⇒<4> InvSaleD_L;<5> Debt_M=[80%]⇒<4> DROA_M;<5> RevG_H Debt_L=[80%]⇒<4> InvSaleD_L;<5> RevG_H Debt_L=[80%]⇒<4> AssetTurn_H;<5> RevG_H DROA_H=[80%]⇒<4> DTAsset_L AssetTurn_H;<5> DTAsset_H DROA_M=[80%]⇒<4> InvSaleD_L;<5> RevG_H DTAsset_L=[80%]⇒<4> DROA_H AssetTurn_H.
