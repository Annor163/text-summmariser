@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents an exact algorithm for solving the knapsack sharing problem with common items. In literature, this problem is also denominated the Generalized Knapsack Sharing Problem (GKSP). The GKSP is NP-hard because it lays on the 0–1 knapsack problem and the knapsack sharing problem. The proposed exact method is based on a rigorous decomposition technique which leads to an intense simplification of the solution procedure for the GKSP. Furthermore, in order to accelerate the procedure for finding the optimum solution, an upper bound and several reduction strategies are considered. Computational results on two sets of benchmark instances from literature show that the proposed method outperforms the other approaches in most instances.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
This paper presents an exact algorithm for solving the knapsack sharing problem with common items (see e.g., Fujimoto & Yamada, 2006). In literature, this problem is also denominated the Generalized Knapsack Sharing Problem (GKSP). As a generalization of the knapsack sharing problem, which has attracted wide attention in the context of the fair distribution of resources, the GKSP appears to be more valuable in real-world applications. This is due to the main consideration of the GKSP, which assumes that all agents have common interests while each of them searches for his own benefits. Such a system could be helpful for developing the incentive mechanism design for mobile phone sensing (see e.g., Zhang et al., 2014).An instance of the GKSP is characterized by a fixed knapsack capacity Cgkspand a setNofn+1disjoint subsetsN0,N1,…,Nn,such thatN=∪i=0nNiandNi∩Nj=∅for (i ≠ j). The first subsetN0denotes the set of common items whereas all other subsetsNi,i=1,…,n,denotes the set of uncommon (individual) items. Each item i belonging to the setNi,i=0,…,n,is characterized by its profit and weight. In this paper, we assume that the profits and weights are positive integers. The objective of the problem is to determine a set of items that maximizes the minimal value of a set of linear functions under the capacity.Let Pkpbe a 0–1 Knapsack Problem (KP) defined on the set of common items (i.e.,N0) and Pkspbe the Knapsack Sharing Problem (KSP) defined on the set of uncommon items (i.e.,∪i=1nNi). Assume thatN0contains m0 items andNicontains miitems, fori=1,…,n. Therefore, Pkpand Pkspcan be formally defined as follows:(Pkp)Zkp=maxp0·x0s.t.w0·x0≤Ckpx0∈{0,1}m0and(Pksp)Zksp=maxmin1≤i≤n{pi·xi}s.t.∑i=1nwi·xi≤Ckspxi∈{0,1}mi,∀i=1,…,n,where Ckp(resp. Cksp) is the capacity, p0(resp. pi,∀i=1,…,n) is the profit vector related to the common (resp. uncommon) items, w0(resp. wi,∀i=1,…,n) is the weight vector related to the common (resp. uncommon) items, and x0is the variable vector (resp. xi,∀i=1,…,n) of Pkp(resp. Pksp). Based on mathematical models of Pkpand Pksp, Pgkspcan be written as follows:(Pgksp)Zgksp=maxmin1≤i≤n{pi·xi}+p0·x0s.t.∑i=1nwi·xi+w0·x0≤Cgkspx0∈{0,1}m0,xi∈{0,1}mi,∀i=1,…,n,whereCgksp=Ckp+Cksp. Indeed, Pgkspcan be recognized as a combination of Pkpand Pksp. From this property, the rest of this paper is devoted to propose some decomposition and reduction techniques for the GKSP. It implies that, instead of directly addressing Pgksp, we try to find the optimum solution of the GKSP by solving a series of Pkpand Pksp.
