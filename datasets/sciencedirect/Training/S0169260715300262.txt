Background and objectiveNon-compartmental analysis (NCA) calculates pharmacokinetic (PK) metrics related to the systemic exposure to a drug following administration, e.g. area under the concentration–time curve and peak concentration. We developed a new package in R, called ncappc, to perform (i) a NCA and (ii) simulation-based posterior predictive checks (ppc) for a population PK (PopPK) model using NCA metrics.MethodsThe nca feature of ncappc package estimates the NCA metrics by NCA. The ppc feature of ncappc estimates the NCA metrics from multiple sets of simulated concentration–time data and compares them with those estimated from the observed data. The diagnostic analysis is performed at the population as well as the individual level. The distribution of the simulated population means of each NCA metric is compared with the corresponding observed population mean. The individual level comparison is performed based on the deviation of the mean of any NCA metric based on simulations for an individual from the corresponding NCA metric obtained from the observed data. The ncappc package also reports the normalized prediction distribution error (NPDE) of the simulated NCA metrics for each individual and their distribution within a population.ResultsThe ncappc produces two default outputs depending on the type of analysis performed, i.e., NCA and PopPK diagnosis. The PopPK diagnosis feature of ncappc produces 8 sets of graphical outputs to assess the ability of a population model to simulate the concentration–time profile of a drug and thereby evaluate model adequacy. In addition, tabular outputs are generated showing the values of the NCA metrics estimated from the observed and the simulated data, along with the deviation, NPDE, regression parameters used to estimate the elimination rate constant and the related population statistics.ConclusionsThe ncappc package is a versatile and flexible tool-set written in R that successfully estimates NCA metrics from concentration–time data and produces a comprehensive set of graphical and tabular output to summarize the diagnostic results including the model specific outliers. The output is easy to interpret and to use in evaluation of a population PK model. ncappc is freely available on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ncappc/index.html/) and GitHub (https://github.com/cacha0227/ncappc/).

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The principal objective of the pharmacokinetics (PK) studies is to understand the kinetics of a drug molecule in terms of absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME). PK data analysis can primarily be classified into non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and model-based analysis, where the latter can range from compartment models to physiology-based models [1]. The NCA benefits from fewer assumptions, compared to model-based approaches. In NCA, the area under the curve (AUC), peak observed drug concentration (Cmax), time of peak concentration (Tmax), terminal elimination rate constant (Lambda_z), terminal half-life (HL_Lambda_z) and other metrics are estimated to determine the systemic exposure of a drug following administration. NCA is typically an essential part of PK analysis in the field of drug discovery and in richly sampled clinical PK studies. Regulatory decisions regarding bioequivalence studies are often based on comparisons of AUC and Cmax, in particular. Additionally, NCA may also be used as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the performance of any compartmental population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models by comparing the NCA metrics obtained from simulated concentration–time data to the same metrics obtained from the observed concentration–time profile. This can provide information on the models ability to provide adequate description of exposure measures that are typically judged as important for richly sampled concentration–time profiles.A number of software tools (such as Kinetica [2], WinNonlin [3], PK module in R [4], Scientist [5], PKSolver [6]) are available that can perform NCA. As a novelty, we have extended the use of NCA as a pharmacometric model diagnostic tool employing the principles of a posterior predictive check [7] with the NCA metrics as test statistics. In this article we report a simulation-based diagnostic package, called ncappc, written in R [8] that (i) provides a simple and flexible method to estimate the NCA metrics from the observed data and (ii) compares them with the same metric estimated from multiple data sets simulated using the PopPK model to be diagnosed. Thus ncappc helps to bridge the gap between NCA and population model analyses. ncappc package can potentially facilitate the early stage of the drug discovery process by evaluating the performance of the related PopPK model and identify the model specific outliers.
