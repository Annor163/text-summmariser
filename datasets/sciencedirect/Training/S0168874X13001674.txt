@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A novel method is developed to determine the optimal stress fields for the hybrid stress element. It provides a straightforward way as to how and why the resulting element can improve its displacement counterpart. A new inner product with material weighting matrix is defined to derive this quantitative method. It reveals the relationship in quantity of exact similarity degrees between different stress modes. It is different from the methods based on the conventional energy product which can only tell whether or not the stress and strain are orthogonal to each other because they are considered as mathematical vectors without any physical meaning. The strategy including two steps is proposed to determine the desired stress field. Firstly, the basic stress modes are broken into a set of sub-modes, where the necessary and unnecessary sub-modes are independent from each other because all of them are uniaxial. Secondly, all sub-modes are compared with their basic mode. The sub-mode with largest similarity degree with the basic mode implies that it represents the most important features inside the basic mode so it is selected as the optimal assumed stress mode for hybrid element. The 2D 4-node and 3D 8-node hybrid elements are illustrated by the present approach. Numerical examples are provided to compare the performances of element derived from different assumed stress fields.nodal displacement vector of elementbasic deformation modes of nodal displacement vectorrigid body motion modes of nodal displacement vectornodal displacement vector for nodekfor anodal displacement vector for nodekforaimatrix for{a1,…,am}matrix for{am+1,…,an}coefficients of polynomials for displacement fieldapplied body force per unit volumegeometry matrix,B=DNmatrix for{ε1,…,εm}material’s elastic stiffness matrixmaterial constant for 2D in Eqs.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since the displacement elements exhibit over rigidity, in 1964 the hybrid stress element was first formulated by Pian [1] using the independent assumed stress field to resolve this issue. In hybrid stress element analysis, the most important aspect is to construct the assumed stress field. Above all, for general use the element should be stable in numerical computation. Brezzi [2] and Babuska et al. [3] gave the necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and convergence of a hybrid element. However, it is often not easy to use these conditions because of the involved analysis. In [4], Pian and Tong suppressed the zero-energy spurious kinematic modes for hybrid element to satisfy the condition of stability, and provided a necessary condition to avoid spurious kinematic deformation modes:M≥n−r, whereMis the total number of stress modes in an assumed stress field, n the total number of nodal displacements, and r the number of rigid body modes in an element. The zero-energy modes were firstly found in isoparametric elements when reduced integration is used [5]. However, in hybrid element, besides the reduced and selective integration [6], the spurious kinematic deformation modes can also be resulted from the unsuitable assumed fields. In this paper, we only consider the zero-energy modes by unsuitable assumed stress field. In order to suppress the spurious kinematic deformation modes, it has been proposed to add stress modes with high-order terms, but this still cannot guarantee that all spurious kinematic deformation modes are removed. Moreover, each extra term may increase the unwanted element rigidity on the contrary and overuse of stress modes will also cost more computational time because the calculation of element stiffness matrix requires inversion of the flexibility matrix whose rank is equal to the number of stress modes. Therefore, m(=n−r) least-order stress modes are considered to be optimal with respect to efficiency [7]. To tell whether or not an assumed stress field is optimal, researchers tend to study the hybrid element rigidity with different assumed stress fields [8,9]. This seems reasonable because the hybrid element is developed to overcome the problem of the over rigidity for its displacement counterpart. On one hand, based on the limitation principle by Stolarski and Belytschko [10], Hoa and Feng [11] pointed out that the hybrid element is totally equivalent to its displacement counterpart when the assumed stress field is exactly derived from the displacement field. Thus the rigidity of the hybrid element is exactly equal to that of its displacement counterpart and cannot overcome the problem of over rigidity. On the other hand, when an element includes zero-energy modes, the rigidities for these modes are equal to zero. Thus this element cannot be used in general case. Therefore, the optimal stress field should be assumed such that the hybrid stress element rigidity is more than zero and less than its displacement counterpart.To develop high performance hybrid stress elements, a number of approaches for obtaining the optimal stress modes have been presented. Pian and Sumihara [12] derived the famous assumed stress hybrid element (P–S element) through a rational choice of stress terms. Han and Hoa [13] proposed the iso-function method to derive the assumed stress modes from the displacement element stress field but all the constraints are relaxed. Huang [9] introduced the concept of natural deformation modes and natural stress modes and developed a modal technique to find natural stress modes for hybrid elements. Feng and Hoa [11,14] proposed the classification method. They classified the initial stress modes by the iso-function method [13] into m groups corresponding to the m natural deformation modes and a zero-energy group corresponding to the rigid body modes. They also provided the optimal stress modes to construct hybrid element free from spurious kinematic deformation modes. Using group theory, Punch and Atluri [7,15] tried to solve the zero-energy problem and gave a set of assumed stress fields. Pian and Chen [8] presented the basic deformation modes to determine the necessary stress modes. The basic deformation modes included all the possible deformations. Pian and Tong [16] introduced the internal displacement parameters to relax the stress equilibrium condition and used isoparametric interpolation to construct hybrid element. Pian and Wu [17] introduced incompatible displacements to maintain completeness. The initial choice of stress terms is unconstrained, i.e., complete polynomials. The additional displacements are used as Lagrange multipliers to enforce the stress equilibrium constraint. Chen and Cheung [18] constrained the stress by setting the inner product between the non-constant stress modes and the deformation derived from the incompatible displacement to zero. This concept with the incompatible displacement can be traced back to the well-known incompatible elements Q6 [19] and QM6 [20]. In [21], Sze employed orthogonal stress modes to construct hybrid element. Besides, in [22] the orthogonal stress modes were employed to construct the hybrid elements so that they are free from inversion of flexibility matrix and thus the computational cost is reduced. Wu and Cheung [23] proposed the optimization method with trial function to construct the assumed stress field. Xie and Zhou [24] obtained the energy-compatible stress mode by the energy compatibility condition. Ping et al. [25] extracted the independent assumed stress fields from the eigensolutions to compute singular field in an anisotropic material. Fu et al. [26,27] proposed the stress function to derive the assumed stress for hybrid stress function plane element. Darilmaz et al. [28,29] selected the parameters of stress field from numerical experimentations for hybrid elements which are more accurate and less sensitive to geometric distortion. Cook [30] provided a stress field where the stiffness is adjustable. Zhang [31] also worked on the stress modes and their effects on the stiffness and eigenvalues. Zhang et al. [32–34] proposed a selection method with basic deformation modes to improve the classification method [14]. The complicated natural deformation modes are replaced by the simple basic deformation modes which were derived directly from the displacement field and the energy product was used to avoid the numerical modal analysis. Zhang [37–41] suppressed the zero-energy modes via assumed stress modes with orthogonal basic deformation modes. To get a desired assumed stress field, methods are also required to compare the performance of different elements with different assumed stress fields [37–39]. Pian and Wu [42] summarized the state of the art for hybrid stress elements by the turn of the century.Closely related to the assumed stress method is the enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method pioneered by Simo and Rifai [43]. Its variational basis is the Hu–Washizu principle which includes displacements, stresses, and enhanced strains. EAS elements have been developed by many authors [18,44]. Yeo and Lee [45] proved that the EAS concept in some model situation is equivalent to a Hellinger–Reissner formulation. In addition, Lee and Rhiu [46] developed the hybrid finite elements with independent strains based on the modified Hellinger–Reissner principle. The assumed strains of higher order are used to suppress undesirable kinematic modes induced by the reduced and selective integration. Jog et al. [47] also chose the higher-order terms to suppress the zero-energy modes for hybrid axisymmetric elements. The assumed natural strain (ANS) method [48] based on the parametrized variational principles [49] is another method closely related to the assumed stress method. ANS element produces no rank deficiency unlike many forms of reduced integration and is easily extendible to geometrically non-linear problems. As a variant of the hybrid stress elements, the hybrid Trefftz elements have been proved to be efficient for solving engineering problems with local effects [50–54]. Moreover, some popular transition elements have been derived by using the hybrid stress formulations [55–58]. So far, by virtue of generalized variational principles such as Hellinger–Reissner principle and Hu–Washizu principle, a great number of enhanced stress/strain elements have been obtained [59–64].Although many assumed stress fields are derived by different methods for the hybrid stress element based on the Hellinger–Reissner principle, there are still limitations and the solutions are not very satisfactory. The basic deformation modes presented by Pian and Chen [8] can describe any deformation for the element because they are derived directly from the displacement field, but the shear components were ignored in their basic strains. Moreover, because the energy product is used, their method is limited to the qualitative investigation between the basic strain modes and the stress modes. The natural deformation mode introduced by Huang [9] can also describe any deformation for element, but they are complicated because the modal technique and numerical iteration procedures are used. In the classification method by Feng and Hoa [11,14], the modal technique is also used to select the optimal stress modes so the numerical analysis cannot be avoided. Besides, due to the fact that the eigenvalues are equivalent to the deformation energies corresponding to their eigenvector, the limitation is similar to the conventional energy product. Indeed, their so-called optimal stress modes depend upon the sequence of the initial stress modes arrangement. The selection method by Zhang [34–36] with basic deformation modes still used the conventional energy product. However, the conventional energy product is invalid particularly for some stress modes where the energy products are equal to each other. That is why the methods based on the conventional energy product as well as the modal technique can only be used to select the stress modes to suppress the zero-energy deformation but they cannot be used to determine the optimal mode from them. So the basic deformation modes as well as their initial stress modes have to be arranged in specific sequence. Moreover, the assumed stress fields obtained by different methods have to be verified in numerical examples or compared with the models which require special talents [1]. Indeed, the parasitic shear is clear in mechanics and should be excluded in the assumed stress field for hybrid element, but one cannot eliminate it using an appropriate mathematical reason. In conclusion, there is still lack of a rational way for deriving the optimal assumed stress modes. No one can tell how much the optimal rigidity should be for a hybrid element. The conventional energy product or eigenvalues is not enough for the more intensive quantitative analysis. More investigation for the stress modes is still desired to construct the optimal assumed stress field for hybrid element.It is our attempt to find a suitable method to reveal the quantitative relationship between the different stress modes and determine the optimal assumed stress modes for hybrid elements. There is no denying that the displacement element has achieved its great success, even though it has the shortcoming of over rigidity. So the necessary factors are major while the unnecessary factors are minor in its stress field, i.e., the basic stress field. The optimal stress field should include the necessary modes and free from the unnecessary modes inside this basic stress field. In our work, we break the basic stress into a set of sub-modes, where the necessary and unnecessary modes are independent from each other because all of them are uniaxial. Then a new inner product is introduced with the material matrix as the weighting matrix. The associated norm of stress mode has the specific physical meaning as its flexibility. Moreover, the similarity degree is defined as the absolute value of the cosine of their inter angle. It can be used to investigate the relationship between the sub-modes and their basic stress modes. The sub-mode with largest similarity degree implies that it represents the most important features for the basic stress field, so it should be selected as the optimal stress mode for the hybrid element.This paper is organized as follows. The hybrid stress element method is briefly reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, some previous approaches to derive the assumed stress fields are investigated and discussed. Then the basic deformation modes as well as their basic stress modes are presented in Section 4. Subsequently, in Section 5, a new inner product with material matrix is introduced and an innovation quantitative method to determine the optimal assumed stress modes for hybrid element is proposed. In Section 6 numerical investigations of element performances for different hybrid elements are shown. Finally the concluding remarks are drawn in Section 7.In hybrid elements, the stress field in the element is assumed independently as follows:(1)σ=∑i=1Mσiβi=Pβwhereσi's are the assumed stress modes,βi's are the corresponding stress parameters, andP={σ1,⋯,σM}is the stress matrix. Besides, the displacement field is assumed as follows:(2)u=Nawhere N and a are the shape function matrix and the nodal displacement vector of the element under consideration, respectively, as(3)N={N1I,…,NneI},a={a1nod⋮anenod}in whichneis the number of nodes,Nkthe shape function, I the identity matrix of2×2for 2D and3×3for 3D, andaknodthe displacement vector for nodekas(4)aknod={ukvk}for2Dandaknod={ukvkwk}for3DThen the deformation in the element is(5)ε=Du=Bain whichDis the matrix of differential operator andB=DNis the geometry matrix.The element equilibrium equation of a hybrid stress element can be obtained via the Hellinger–Reissner variational principle:(6)ΠHR(σ,u)=∫Ve(−12σTSσ+σT(Du)−uTb)dV−∫Se∩StuTtdSwhereVeandSerepresent the element domain and boundary, respectively,Stimplies the traction or natural boundary, b and t denote the applied body force and boundary traction, respectively, S is the material compliant matrix. Substituting Eqs. (1) and (2) into the functional (6), the approximate functional becomes(7)ΠHRh(β,a)=−12βTHβ+βTGa−aTfwith(8)H=∫VePTSPdV,G=∫VePTBdV,f=∫VeNTbdV+∫Se∩StNTtdSA standard stationary variational argument of Eq. (7) with respect to β leads to the following relationship:(9)β=H−1Gaand consequently Eq. (7) reduces to(10)ΠHRh(a)=12aTKa−aTfwith the element stiffness matrix(11)K=GTH−1GThus from the stationary condition ofΠHRh(a)of Eq. (10) with respect to a, the equilibrium equation of a hybrid element can be obtained as(12)Ka=fWhen the solution for a is determined, the stress can be calculated using Eqs. (1) and (9) as(13)σ=PH−1GaIn [38,40], the following linearly independent transformation of the assumed stress field is further considered as(14)P=P˜Twhere T is the nonsingular transformation matrix and(15)P˜={σ˜1,…,σ˜M}The relationship between H andH˜is(16)H=∫VePTSPdV=TT∫VeP˜TSP˜dVT=TTH˜TBesides, the relationship between G andG˜is(17)G=∫VePTBdV=TT∫VeP˜TBdV=TTG˜Note that the matrixTis nonsingular, substitution of Eqs. (16) and (17) into Eq. (11) yields(18)K=GTH−1G=(TTG˜)T(TTH˜T)−1(TTG˜)=G˜TTT−1H˜−1(TT)−1TTG˜=G˜TH˜−1G˜=K˜Proposition 1A linearly independent transformation of the assumed stress field gives a fully equivalent hybrid finite element.Moreover, in the hybrid finite element analysis, a stress subspace including all the assumed stress modes was introduced as [22](19)S={σ∈(L2(Ve))nd|σ=∑i=1Mβiσi,βi∈ℝ}wherendis the dimension ofS, i.e.,nd=3for 2D andnd=6for 3D. In addition, one can define the following inner product of stress modes:(20)〈σi,Sσj〉=∫VeσiTSσjdV,σi,σj∈SThen the norm considered as the flexibility of stress mode can be written as(21)‖σi‖S=〈σi,Sσi〉1/2,σi∈SWith Eq. (20) the flexibility matrixHin Eq. (8) becomes(22)H=[〈σ1,Sσ1〉⋯〈σ1,SσM〉⋮⋮⋮〈σM,Sσ1〉⋯〈σM,SσM〉]Due to the fact that H is the Gram matrix forσi's based on the inner product in Eq. (20), H is nonsingular if and only ifσi's are linearly independent. Indeed, the inner product in Eq. (20) provides the relationship between the modes in the assumed stress subspace in Eq. (19). So the equivalent orthogonal stress modesσi˜'s forσi's can be derived by the Gram–Schmidt’s method as given in the following:(23){σ˜1=σ1σ˜i=σi−∑j=1i−1〈σi,Sσ˜j〉〈σ˜j,Sσ˜j〉σ˜jfori=2,…,Mand the relatingH˜reduces to a diagonal matrix(24)H˜=[‖σ˜1‖S2⋱‖σ˜M‖S2]Obviously in this caseH˜is positive definite due to the fact that||σ˜i||S2>0when σi's are linearly independent. Moreover, Eq. (16) implies that H andH˜are congruent and both of them are concurrently positive definite or not. In conclusion, if σi's are linearly independent, H is not only nonsingular but also positive definite. It should be noted that orthogonal equivalents include Poisson’s ratioνbecause the inner product used for orthogonalization is defined with material matrix in Eq. (20).Pian and Chen split the element displacements into deformation modes and rigid body displacements and proposed the concept of basic deformation modes. Then, they provided the one-βper one-αscheme to construct the assumed stress modes. The following text till Eq. (28) is copied from Ref. [8] only with the change of equation number for the sake of the consistency in this paper.Consider a 4-node rectangular membrane element of dimension2×2with the reference axesxandypassing the centroid and parallel to the sides of the element. The assumed displacementuandvare bilinear and the five basic deformation modes are(25){u=α1x+α3y+α4xyv=α3x+α2y+α5xyand the corresponding strains are(26){εx=∂u∂x=α1+α4yεy=∂v∂y=α2+α5xγxy=∂u∂y+∂v∂x=2α3here, each α is associated with a distinct strain mode. The deformation energy due to assumed stresses and displacements is given by(27)Ii=∫−1+1∫−1+1σiεidxdywhere the subscriptirefers to theith deformation modes. Obviously, in order to makeIinonzero, the following assumed stress terms may be used:(28){σx=β1+β4yσy=β2+β5xσxy=β3The assumed stress field in Eq. (28) is the same as that in Ref [1]. However, from Eq. (25), the correct strain field should be derived as(29){εx=∂u∂x=α1+α4yεy=∂v∂y=α2+α5xγxy=∂u∂y+∂v∂x=2α3+α4x+α5yThe parasitic shearsα4xandα5yin Eq. (29) are eliminated in Pian and Chen’s strain from the basic deformation modes in order to obtain the assumed stress mode without parasitic shear component as required in Ref [1]. In other words, Pian and Chen’s strain field is not realistic because they cannot be derived from the relating displacement field. Therefore, these strains for the basic deformation modes are not appropriate to describe the strain for any element deformation.Huang [9] proposed the concept of natural deformation mode for hybrid element, which are the eigenvectors of the corresponding displacement counterpart by modal analysis. Besides, the eigenvalues are taken to describe the element performance. It is well known that the eigenvectors can be used to describe any deformation of this displacement element. And the eigenvalues are the equivalent element energies corresponding to their eigenvectors. Since the hybrid element assumed the same displacement field as their displacement counterpart, the natural deformation modes can also be used to describe any deformation of this hybrid element. Huang proposed the eigenfunction method to derive the natural stress modes.Based on the natural deformation modes, Feng and Hoa [14] proposed the classification method. They used the modal technique with the natural deformation modes to classify the initial stress modes into m groups corresponding to the m natural deformation modes and a zero-energy group corresponding to the rigid body modes. They also provided the optimal stress modes to construct hybrid element free from kinematic deformation modes. During their operations [9,11,14] the natural deformation modes are used as a ruler to check and determine the expected modes from the initial stress modes. That is a good idea and is different from the direct derivation of assumed stress modes by Pian and Chen [8] and others. Zhang et al. [32–34] proposed the selection method with basic deformation modes to improve the classification method [14]. The simple basic deformation modes are used to replace the complicated natural deformation modes. Moreover, the numerical modal technique is replaced by the energy product between initial stress modes and basic strain modes. The selection for desired stress modes has been proved to be very simple and straightforward. However, there is still something to be improved:1.Because the natural deformation modes are dependent upon the material, in general they are very complicated and it is not easy to recognize and describe. In addition, the numerical method has to be used in the eigenfunction method for the iteration procedure to derive the natural stress modes. In classification method, the numerical method is also needed in the modal technique to investigate the relationship between the initial stress modes according to the natural deformation modes.To obtain the optimal stress modes, the energy product is not enough because it can only tell whether or not the initial stress modes are orthogonal to the basic deformation modes; the modal technique is not enough since eigenvalues are the element energies of their eigenvectors. That is why the results from classification method and basic deformation modes method are dependent upon the arrangement of initial stress modes and the eigenfunction method needs additional manipulations for the natural deformation modes with multiple eigenvalues. So the conventional energy product as well as the modal technique can only be used to select the stress modes to suppress the zero-energy deformation but they cannot be used to determine the optimal mode of them.In this paper the basic deformation modes are derived using the curl from the element displacement field. Then the relating basic stress modes are taken into consideration instead of the basic strain modes in the traditional method to determine the optimal stress modes for hybrid stress element. It should be noted that the basic strain modes in our paper include the parasitic shear, which are different from those by Pian and Chen [8], so the relating basic stress modes include the parasitic shear stress components which will be eliminated automatically in the next section.Consider an element that has n degrees of freedom which include r rigid body degrees of freedom andm=n−rdeformation degrees of freedom, then any displacement nodal vectoraof the element can be expressed as a linear combination of n linearly independent vectorsai's, i.e.(30)a=∑i=1nαiai,ai={a1nod⋮anenod}i={(a1nod)i⋮(anenod)i}Substituting Eq. (30) into Eq. (2) gives(31)u=∑i=1nαiuiwhereui's are the basic modes of displacement field given by(32)ui=Nai,i=1,2,…,nClearlyai's in Eqs. (30) and (32) represent the nodal displacement vectors associated with the independent modes of the element displacement field.There is no unique way to choose linearly independentai's, for example, the set of n unit vectors as shown inFig. 1 is commonly the most convenient choice for 2D 4-node quadrilateral element inFig. 2. However, with this specific choice the desired mode separation for different characteristic deformations is unclear for the m deformation modes and r rigid body modes. In [9], Huang proposed the natural deformation modes, namely the eigenvectors of the corresponding displacement counterpart of the hybrid element. Unfortunately since the natural deformation modes are so complicated, an iterative numerical procedure has to be employed to obtain these modes. Here we attempt to remove the rigid body motions from the deformation modes in order to achieve the complete mode separation.In the further development, we denote the modes of displacement field in the case of 2D element as given in the following:(33){u1,u2,u3u4,…,umum+1um+2,um+3forconstantstrainsforstrainsofhigherorderforrigidbodymotionofrotationforrigidbodymotionsoftranslationand in the case of 3D elements as given in the following:(34){u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6u7,…,umum+1,um+2,um+3um+4,um+5,um+6forconstantstrainsforstrainsofhigherorderforrigidbodymotionsofrotationforrigidbodymotionsoftranslationIn general the rigid body motions include translation and rotation. Obviously, the constants in element displacement field represent the translational rigid body displacements, which can be considered as the displacements at the element centroid,x=0, as(35)uc=u(0)These constants are used to determine the basic displacement modes for translational rigid body motions as{um+2,um+3}for 2D element or{um+4,um+5,um+6}for 3D element. Since the displacement field is usually assumed along x-, y-, and z-axis, the determination of rigid body rotations is not very straightforward. In order to overcome this problem, we consider the curl for element displacement vector as given in the following:(36)ω=12∇×uwhere∇is Nabla symbol of the vector differential operator. For the case of 3D element(37)ω={ωxωyωz},u={uvw},∇={∂∂x∂∂y∂∂z}So(38)ωx=12(∂w∂y−∂v∂z),ωy=12(∂u∂z−∂w∂x),ωz=12(∂v∂x−∂u∂y)The constants in Eq. (36) that are not attached to the coordinates represent the rigid body rotation, namely(39)ωc=ω(0)Meanwhile, the constant strains can be also derived as(40)εc=ε(0)It should be noted that the Nabla symbol∇and the differential operator D are about the first derivatives with respect to coordinates. For example, in the case of 3D element, D is expressed as(41)D=[∂∂x000∂∂y000∂∂z∂∂y∂∂x00∂∂z∂∂y∂∂z0∂∂x]Consequently, the constants in Eqs. (39) and (40) can only relate to the terms of first-order in displacement field. In other words, the displacements for both rigid body rotations and constant strains can only be included in the terms of first-order which can be separated by using the parameters in Eqs. (39) and (40). Thus the displacement modes for rotational rigid body motions and the basic deformation modes for constant strains can be determined as{u1,u2,u3,um+1}for 2D element or{u1,u2,u3,um+1,um+2,um+3}for 3D element. Namely, they can be used to express the displacement terms of first-order. For the case of 2D element(42)uh1=∑i=13uiαi︸forconstantstrains+um+1αm+1︸forrigidbodyrotationwhile for the case of 3D element(43)uh1=∑i=16αiui︸forconstantstrains+∑i=m+1m+3αiui︸forrigidbodyrotationsFinally, the remaining parameters in terms of second-and-higher-order in displacement field are the last independent parameters because there is not any rigid body motion. So their basic deformation modes{u4,…,um}for 2D element or{u7,…,um}for 3D element can be determined.The procedures to determine the basic deformation modes can be expressed inTable 1.Following the procedure in Table 1, the displacement modes for rigid body motions and deformations can be determined and separated from the displacement field as(44)u=∑i=1mαiui+∑i=m+1nαiui=N¯α+N¯rαr={N¯,N¯r}{ααr}where(45)N¯={u1,…,um},α={α1⋮αm},N¯r={um+1,…,un},αr={αm+1⋮αn}The nodal displacement vectors relating to the basic deformations and rigid body modes can be readily obtained by substitution of the nodal coordinates into Eq.

However, in this paper we use the derived basic stress modes to find the optimal stress field for hybrid stress element.By the geometry equation in Eq. (5) with the basic displacement, the hybrid element basic strain can be derived as(49)ε=∑i=1mαiεi=B¯αwhere(50)B¯={ε1,…,εm}in which the basic strain mode for the basic deformation modeaican be expressed as(51)εi=BaiSince the linearly independent basic deformation modesai's provide all information for any deformation of a hybrid element, the derived basic strains can be used to suppress the zero-energy deformation modes in the element [8,35,32]. However, in this paper we derive the basic stress modes to construct the optimal stress field for hybrid stress element. From Eq. (49) the basic stress can be derived as(52)σ′=∑i=1mαiσi′=P′αwhere(53)P′={σ1′,…,σm′}=CBAin whichAis expressed in Eq. (47) and the basic stress modes are expressed as(54)σi′=Cεi=CBaiThe basic stress in Eq. (52) is also the stress for displacement element because it is derived from the displacement. As we know, the number of assumed stress modes for hybrid element should satisfy(55)M≥m=n−rBecause the number of the basic stress modesm=n−ris equal to the degrees of freedom for element, it is the least for the optimal requirement. However, inside the basic stress modes, some components are unnecessary. To verify this, we can take the basic stress modes as the assumed stress modes for hybrid element as(56)σi=σi′,i=1,2,…,mnamely the assumed stress field for hybrid element is expressed as(57)σ=∑i=1mσi′βi′=P′β′Noting thatS=C−1and using Eq. (53), one has(58)H'=∫VeP′TSP′dV=ATK′AwhereK′is the stiffness matrix for the displacement counterpart expressed as(59)K′=∫VeBTCBdVEq. (58) indicates thatH′represents the displacement element energies for the basic deformation modes. Besides, one has(60)G′=∫VeP′TBdV=AT∫VeBTCBdV=ATK′Substituting Eqs. (58) and (60) into Eq. (9), the stress parameters for hybrid element can be calculated as follows:(61)β′=H′−1G′a=(ATK′A)−1(ATK′)Aα=αSo, the stress parameters are exactly equal to the independent parameters for basic stress modes. It should be noted that, because K′ generally is not positive definite, it cannot be inverted. Besides, A isnbymwithm≠nso it cannot be inverted. Substitution of Eq. (61) into Eq. (57) gives(62)σ=P′β′=P′α=σ′It implies that the stress field for hybrid element is exactly equal to its displacement counterpart. Then the hybrid element cannot get rid of the shortcoming of over rigidity. In other words, there are unnecessary components inside the basic stress modes even though the number of assumed stress modes is the least as required.For the 2D 4-node quadrilateral hybrid element (in Fig. 2) withn=8includingr=3andm=5, the element displacement in Eq. (2) can be expressed as(63){uv}=∑i=14Ni{uivi}where the shape functions can be expressed as(64)Ni=14(1+xix)(1+yiy),i=1,2,3,4The displacement fields in Eq. (63) can be expanded and rewritten as(65){u=A0+A1x+A2y+A3xyv=B0+B1x+B2y+B3xywhere(66)[A0B0A1B1A2B2A3B3]=14[1111−111−1−1−1111−11−1][u1v1u2v2u3v3u4v4]The basic deformation modes as well as the rigid body motions can be derived by the procedures in Table 1. Because m=5, the rigid body motions by Eqs. (39) and (35) using Eq. (65) are taken as the following independent parameters:(67)α6=(ωz)c=12(B1−A2)α7=uc=A0α8=vc=B0And, the constant strains calculated by Eq. (40) using Eq. (65) are taken as the additional independent parameters(68)α1=(εx)c=A1α2=(εy)c=B2α3=12(γxy)c=12(B1+A2)Finally, the remaining constants represent the last independent parameters as(69)α4=A3,α5=B3By means of Eqs. (67)–(69), one has(70){A0=α7,A1=α1,A2=α3−α6,A3=α4B0=α8,B1=α3+α6,B2=α2,B3=α5Substituting Eq. (70) into Eq.

(67)–(69). Clearly, the displacement field in Eq. (71) is separated into rigid body motions and pure deformations. The element nodal displacement can be readily obtained by substitution of the nodal coordinates into Eq. (71) and expressed as(73)a=∑i=15αiai+∑i=68αiai=Aα+Arαr={A,Ar}{ααr}where(74)A={a1,a2,a3,a4,a5}=[−10−1100−1−10110−1−100−110−11011001101−101−1001−10−1],Ar={a6,a7,a8}=[110−101110101−110101−110−101]The basic deformations and rigid body modes of 2D 4-node quadrilateral element are shown inFigs. 3 and 4, respectively. It can be seen that with the present definition of deformation modes, the deformations and rigid body motions can be easily identified.By the geometry equation in Eq. (5) with the element displacement field in Eq. (71), the element strain can be expressed as(75)ε=∑i=15αiεi=B¯αwhere the basic strain modes are expressed as(76)B¯=DN¯={ε1,ε2,ε3,ε4,ε5}=[100y00100x002xy]For Young’s modulusEand Poison’s ratioν, the material stiffness matrix can be expressed as(77)C=[C11C120C21C22000C33]where(78)C11=C22=C,C12=C21=νC,C33=Gin which(79)C=E1−ν2,G=E2(1+ν)For the plane-strain problem, the constants in Eq. (77) are replaced as(80)E→E1−ν2,ν→ν1−νDue to the fact that Poison’s ratio in general satisfies the following condition:(81)0≤ν<12So, by Eq. (79) one has(82)E≥C>GThen the basic stress field can be derived from Eq.

However, it is found that the parametersα^16,α^17,α^18relate to the basic deformation modes as follows:(89)u^16={yz00},u^17={0zx0},u^18={00xy}They result into the modes including the shears with two nonzero components of same order as given in the following:(90)ε^16={000z0y},ε^17={000zx0},ε^18={0000xy}Since we want to derive the basic deformation modes as simple as possible, the alternative parameters are introduced as given in the following:(91){α16=12(α^16+α^17)α17=12(α^17+α^18)α18=12(α^18+α^16)It is easy to verify that the above transformation is nonsingular as(92){A5=α^16=α16−α17+α18B6=α^17=α16+α17−α18C4=α^18=−α16+α17+α18By the transformation in Eq. (91), the alternative basic deformation modes can be derived as(93)u16={yzzx−xy},u17={−yzzxxy},u18={yz−zxxy}which correspond to the following strains including the shears with only one nonzero component as(94)ε16={0002z00},ε17={00002x0},ε18={000002y}Consequently, the displacement field for the pure deformation can be derived from Eq. (87) and expressed in the form of basic deformation modes as(95)u=∑i=118αiui=N¯αin which the basic deformations are as given in the following:(96)N¯={u1,…,u18}=[x00y0z0y0xz000z0yxxyzxxyz000000yz−yzyz000yzxyxyz000zxzx−zx000000zxyzxyz−xyxyxy]In addition, substitution of nodal coordinates into Eq. (95) gives(97)a=∑i=118αiai=Aαwhereai's are the nodal displacement vector for basic deformation modes. The basic deformation modes are shown inFig. 6.By the geometry equation in Eq. (5) with the element displacement field in Eq. (95), the element basic strain field can be expressed as(98)ε=∑i=118αiεi=B¯αwhere the basic strain modes as(99)B¯={ε1,…,ε18}=[100000yzyz000000000010000000zxzx000000001000000000xyxy000000200x0zx0yyz0002z00000020000y0xy0zzx02x00000020xxy000z0yz002y]For the case of 3D problem, the material stiffness can be expressed as(100)C=[C11C12C13000C21C22C23000C31C32C33000000C44000000C55000000C66]where(101)C11=C22=C33=CC12=C21=C13=C31=C23=C32=νCC44=C55=C66=Gin whichGis expressed as that in Eq. (79) while(102)C=(1−v)E(1−2ν)(1+v)Thus, the basic stress field can be derived as(103)σ′=∑i=118αiσi′=P′αwhere(104)P′={σ1′,…,σ18′}=[C11C12C13000C11yC11zC11yzC21C22C23000C21yC21zC21yzC31C32C33000C31yC31zC31yz0002C4400C44x0C44zx00002C550000000002C660C66xC66xyC12zC12xC12zxC13xC13yC13xy000C22zC22xC22zxC23xC23yC23xy000C32zC32xC32zxC33xC33yC33xy0000C44yC44yz0002C44z00C55y0C55xy0C55zC55zx02C55x0000C66z0C66yz002C66y]It should be noticed that the basic deformation modes are just them(=n−r)bases to describe any element deformation, they are something like the unit vectors ofndimensions to describe any vector in the spaceℝn. However, withrrigid body motions being removed, their number ism(=n−r)although the dimension of their vectors is n. In other words, they occupy a subspace ofmdimensions inℝnofndimensions.The parasitic shears are intrinsic for this type of element so long as the displacement field is determined according to the number of nodes. So, they cannot be simply eliminated for the purpose to improve the element performance. If anyone wants to remove their effects, a best way is to set the related energy to zero by letting the related stress components to equal zero. That is the object of the hybrid element analysis.Pian and Chen [8] also presented the basic deformation modes. However, they derived the basic strain field in Eq. (26) where the parasitic shearsα4xandα5ywere ignored. This should be included as shown in Eq. (29). Clearly, their relating basic deformation modes in Eq. (26) are different from those we present in Eq. (75) with Eq. (76). So their basic strain field cannot be derived from the displacement field. In other words, their basic strain modes cannot be used to describe any strain for element which is derived from the displacement field. So their basic strains are not realistic.The basic stress modes have been derived in last section to describe the basic stress field from the displacement field for the hybrid element, namely the stress filed for its displacement counterpart. There arem(=n−r)basic stress modes relating to the element degrees of freedom, so they can be analyzed one by one to reveal the performance of the basic stress field. It is well known that the displacement element has the problem of over rigidity, so there are unnecessary factors inside the basic stress field. It has also been proved in last section that when the basic stress modes are taken exactly as the assumed stress modes for the hybrid element, i.e., the assumed modes coincide with the basic modes or their inter angles are zero degree, the resulting hybrid element is equivalent to its displacement counterpart. For this case, the problem of over rigidity cannot be overcome. So it is out of our consideration. On the contrary, when the assumed modes are orthogonal to the basic modes or their inter angle are ninety degree, the corresponding basic deformation modes are zero-energy, i.e., the element rigidity for these deformation modes are zero. We also have to avoid this case because the element cannot be used in general. Therefore, the stress field should be assumed such that the hybrid element rigidity is less than its displacement counterpart and more than zero. In other words, the inter angles between assumed modes and basic modes should be larger than zero degree and less than 90°. But what is the best angle? It should be such that the assumed stress field only includes the necessary components and without the unnecessary components from the basic stress field. For this purpose, we break every basic stress mode into several sub-modes, where each component of basic stress mode is used to construct a sub-mode so all the sub-modes are uniaxial. Then these sub-modes are compared with their original basic stress mode. The sub-mode with larger similarity degree implies that it stands for more features than others for the basic stress mode. According to our hypothesis that the success factors are major for displacement element, the most similar sub-mode is the necessary mode and can be selected as the optimal mode for the assumed stress field.However, the comparison depends upon the specific inner product because the similarity should be worked out based on it. Perhaps the conventional energy product between stress and strain is easier to turn out in one’s mind, because the over rigidity for the displacement element implies the over deformation energy and the attempt for hybrid counterpart is to cut off this excess energy. Unfortunately, it is found out that the conventional energy product is invalid, because some of the sub-modes have equal similarity with their original basic strain mode. Therefore, we introduce the new inner product with the material matrix as the weighting matrix. Besides, the basic stress modes are considered rather than the basic strain modes as in traditional method. That is very important for the quantitative comparison between the basic stress modes and sub-modes, because both two modes to be compared should have the same physical meaning to guarantee the associated norm and the inter angle can be worked out with reasonable physical meaning. Based on our inner product, the associated norm of the stress mode has the specific physical meaning as its flexibility while the norm based on the conventional energy product only has the mathematical meaning as its generalized geometrical length. Our inner product can be used to investigate the quantitative relationship between the sub-modes and their basic stress modes. The most similar mode is selected as the optimal stress mode. Therefore, by our systematic scheme, the unnecessary components of parasitic shear in displacement element are taken away automatically and the over rigidity problem is overcome satisfactorily. The optimal modes can be determined from all basic stress modes one by one to construct the assumed stress field for hybrid element.On one hand, the shortcoming of over rigidity for displacement element implies that there are unnecessary factors coupled with the necessary factors inside its stress field, i.e., the basic stress field. On the other hand, there is no denying that it has great success. For this reason, we provide the following hypothesis.HypothesisFor displacement element, the main features are good, i.e., there are more good features than bad features.This hypothesis is reasonable. According to it, the necessary factors in the basic stress field are major while the unnecessary factors are minor. Since the basic stress field can be expressed by the basic stress modes, one can conclude that there are unnecessary components coupled with the necessary components in the basic stress modes, where the necessary components are major while the unnecessary components are minor. Our attempt is to obtain the necessary components and without the unnecessary components from the basic stress modes. For this purpose our procedure includes two steps.Step 1: breaking basic stress modes into sub-modesWe take every component of the basic stress mode to construct a sub-mode. Thus the basic stress mode is broken into several sub-modes and can be expressed by the sum of them as(105)σi′=∑k=1nd(σi′)k(i=1,2,…,m)where(106)(σi′)k=α¯ikσ¯jin whichα¯ik's are the coefficient dependent upon the material parameters, andσ¯j's the uniaxial assumed stress modes by iso-function method [13], which are derived from the stress field from displacement element, i.e., the basic stress field as earlier discussion. Clearly, all the sub-modes are uniaxial. That is why they can be expressed uniaxial modesσ¯j's. Moreover, since all of them are uniaxial, they can only be essential and not redundant.Step 2: comparison of sub-modes with their basic stress modeThe sub-modes are compared with their original basic stress mode. The sub-mode with larger similarity degree implies that it is more similar to the original basic stress mode than others, so it represents the main feature of this basic stress mode. According to our hypothesis that main features for the basic stress modes are good, the most similar sub-mode which reflects the main features can be selected as the optimal mode.To investigate the quantitative relationship between the sub-modes with their basic stress modes, their similarity degree is needed. In general, it is defined as the cosine of the angle between vectors. However, according to the proposition 1, the equivalent hybrid element can be resulted from the alternative assumed stress field in which an original mode is multiplied by a nonzero constant. It is easy to verify that the magnitude of this constant does not affect their angle while its sign does. In other words, the reverse direction of the sub-mode will change the cosine sign of its angle with original basic mode. For this sake, the similarity degree is defined as the absolute value of the cosine of the angle as(107)Similaritydegree=|cosθik|whereθikis the angle between(σi′)k=α¯ikσ¯jandσi′. Thus,|cosθik|=1whenθik=0°or180°, indicatingσ¯jis in the same direction asσi′or in the reverse direction toσi′. However, no matter which case,σ¯j, plays the same role to result in the hybrid elements equivalent to each other. On the other hand,|cosθik|=0whenθik=90°, indicating(σi′)k=α¯ikσ¯jandσi′are orthogonal to each other andσ¯jcannot be used to suppress the zero-energy mode for the element.For the subsequent development, a deformation subspace can be defined by basic deformation modes as(108)D={a∈ℝn|a=∑i=1mαiai,αi∈ℝ}⊂ℝnwith the basic strain subspace(109)ℰ={ε∈(L2(Ve))nd|ε=Ba,a∈D}⊂ℝndas well as the basic stress subspace(110)S′={σ′∈(L2(Ve))nd|σ′=Cε,ε∈ℰ}⊂ℝndIn addition, another stress subspace is also defined as(111)S¯={σ¯∈(L2(Ve))nd|σ¯=∑i=1M¯β¯iσ¯i,β¯i∈ℝ}⊂ℝndwhereσ¯i's are the uniaxial assumed stress modes derived by iso-function method [13] withM¯=9for 2D 4-node element andM¯=42for 3D 8-node element.As in the previous discussion, to find the optimal stress modes for hybrid element, the sub-modes have to be compared with their original basic modes, and their similarity degrees should be calculated quantitatively. However, the similarity depends upon the inner product. It is well known for the energy product(112)〈εi,σj〉=∫VeεiTσjdV,εi∈ℰ,σj∈SThis is a conventional inner product where both the strain modes and stress modes are considered as mathematical vectors. However, the strain and stress belong to different mechanical concepts, and their analysis should be in mechanics for our attempt. In addition, even though the inner product has the physical meaning of energy, there is not any physical meaning in the associated norms or generalized lengths of strains and stresses as(113)||εi||=(∫VeεiTεidV)1/2||σj||=(∫VeσjTσjdV)1/2In other words, the strain and stress are only considered as mathematical vectors without any physical meanings. Clearly, without appropriate norm and the relating inter angle, the comparison between the stress modes and basic strain modes is impossible. So, the further discussion is difficult, particularly for some stress modes of which the energy products with their related basic strain modes are equal to each other. Therefore, the inappropriate energy product is found to be the big barrier to determine the optimal stress modes inside the basic stress field.To overcome this problem, the inner product with material matrix as weighting matrix is introduced as(114)〈σi′,S(σi′)k〉=∫Veσi′TS(σi′)kdV,σi′,(σi′)k∈S′∪S¯The associated norms are expressed as(115)‖σi′‖S=(∫Veσi′TSσi′dV)1/2=(∫VeεiTCεidV)1/2‖(σi′)k‖S=(∫Ve(σi′)kTS(σi′)kdV)1/2These norms have the specific physical significance as the flexibility of stress (or stiffness of strain), which is the square root of complementary energy (or deformation energy, in the case of linear elasticity they are equal to each other). It shows the relationship between two stress modes. So this inner product is more reasonable. For this sense, the inner product in Eq. (115) can be used for the quantitative analysis to calculate the similarity of the sub-modes with their basic stress mode.It should be noted that our inner product in Eq. (114) is the development of that in Eq. (20), where our inner product is defined in the mixed subspace of basic stress subspaceS′in Eq. (110) and stress subspaceS¯in Eq. (111) rather than the assumed subspaceSin Eq. (19).Since the straightforward geometrical relationships of vectors should be based on the conventional inner product, it is difficult to directly provide the geometrical relationships based on our inner product. Due to the fact thatSis positive definite, its spectral decomposition is(116)S=ΦTΛΦ=RTRwhereR=Λ1/2Φ, in whichΦis a unitary matrix whose rows comprise an orthogonal basis of eigenvector, andΛis a diagonal matrix whose main diagonal contains the corresponding eigenvalues. Thus the inner product in Eq. (114) can be expressed as(117)〈σi′,S(σi′)k〉=∫Veσi′TS(σ′i)kdV=∫Ve(Rσi′)T(R(σi′)k)dV=〈Rσi′,R(σi′)k〉For this viewpoint, it can be considered as the conventional inner product for the vectorsRσi′andR(σi′)kwith the transformation matrixRforσi′and(σi′)k. Therefore the relationships based on our inner product can be visual. It should be noted that we cannot consider the transformation of stress modes with S instead of R. Otherwise, the two stress modes cannot be treated in the same manner because only one of them is transformed with S while another remains the original. Furthermore, this operation will result into the conventional inner product because the stress mode transformed with S is exactly the strain mode.ConsideringS=C−1, by Eq. (54) one hasεi=Sσ′i. Therefore, from Eq. (112) one has(118)〈εi,σ¯j〉=∫VeεiTσ¯jdV=∫Veσi′TSσ¯jdV=〈σi′,Sσ¯j〉,σi′,σ¯j∈S′∪S¯That means that the value of the energy product in Eq. (112) equals to the inner product in Eq. (114). However, the norms (115) with specific physical meaning are quite different from Eq. (113) only with mathematical meanings and without any physical meaning. For this sense, the inner product in Eq. (114) as well as their similarity in Eq. (107) can be used for the quantitative analysis while the inner product in Eq. (112) cannot. For this reason, in order to obtain the expected assumed stress modes, Pian and Chen [8] ignored the parasitic shear component in their strain from the basic deformation modes. Zhang [34,32] investigated quantitatively the initial stress modes with the basic strains to select the better modes. Because the conventional energy product was still used, the basic deformation modes as well as their initial stress modes have to be arranged in specific sequence.The satisfactory hybrid element should be free of zero-energy mode, namely any deformation for element should have nonzero-energy. The element energy can be expressed as(119)2U=aTKa=aT(GTH−1G)a,a∈D⊂ℝnIn general, the quadratic form in Eq. (119) is not positive definite when the element includes the rigid body degree of freedom. So, it is not convenient to be used for the suppression of zero-energy deformation mode for element, and it is necessary to derive the alternatives from Eq. (119).The following alternative quadratic form can be derived from Eq. (119) with Eq. (9) as(120)2U=βTHβ,β∈ℝMThis energy quadratic form is always positive definite becauseHis positive definite regardless of the boundary condition of the element. So it is more convenient to determine if a deformation mode gives rise to zero-energy or not. It can be concluded from Eq. (120) that a deformation is zero-energy if and only if it results in the zero stress parameter. In other words, there is the following sufficient and necessary relationship as:(121)β≠0⇔U>0Moreover, since(122)Gia=∫VeσiTBdVa=∫VeσiTBadV=∫VeσiTεdV=〈ε,σi〉from Eq. (119) one has(123)2U=ρTH−1ρ,ρ∈ℝMwhere(124)ρ=Ga={G1aG2a⋮GMa}={〈ε,σ1〉〈ε,σ2〉⋮〈ε,σM〉}Eq. (124) is the vector of the inner product between the element strain and the assumed stress modes. It indicates their coupled relationship. Due to the fact thatρ=0means that the strain mode is orthogonal to all the assumed stress modes, one can conclude that a deformation mode is a zero-energy mode if and only if its derived strain is orthogonal to all the assumed stress modes. So the general approach to determine the zero-energy mode is provided with the inner product and examination of orthogonality. Thus we find the following sufficient and necessary relationship as:(125)ρ≠0⇔U>0Proposition 2(Sufficient and necessary conditions to determine a zero-energy mode). Any deformation mode is a zero-energy mode, namelyU=0, if and only if itsρ=0.According to Proposition 2, we would like to point out the following:1.The assumed stress modes can be used to identify whether a deformation mode is a zero-energy mode or not. If all the stress modes are orthogonal to this deformation mode, it is a zero-energy mode, otherwise not. This is a straightforward approach to determine a zero-energy mode.To guarantee that a deformation mode a is not a zero-energy mode, there should exist at least one stress mode that is coupled with its derived strain. Therefore the suppression of zero-energy mode can be implemented via selecting some derived strain-coupled assumed stress modes. It turns out this provides a very convenient way for suppression of zero-energy mode.Consider Eqs. (9) and (124) as well as Eq. (48), the following alternative quadratic form can also be derived from Eq. (119) as:(126)2U=αT(MTH−1M)α,α∈ℝmwhere(127)M=GA=[〈ε1,σ1〉〈ε2,σ1〉⋯〈εm,σ1〉〈ε1,σ2〉〈ε2,σ2〉⋯〈εm,σ2〉⋮⋮⋮〈ε1,σm〉〈ε2,σm〉⋯〈εm,σm〉]SinceHis positive definite, the energy quadratic form in Eq. (126) is positive definite for nonsingularM. In fact, for∀α≠0sinceρ=Ga=GAα=Mα≠0whenMis nonsingular, one has(128)2U=αT(MTH−1M)α=ρTH−1ρ>0So it is more convenient to determine if any element is free of zero-energy mode or not. The following sufficient and necessary relationship can be obtained as:(129)α≠0⇔U>0Proposition 3(Sufficient and necessary conditions for zero-energy-free element). The hybrid element is free of zero-energy mode if and only ifMis nonsingular.Proposition 3 provides the sufficient and necessary conditions for the zero-energy-free hybrid element. It is very convenient to determine whether or not an element is free of any zero-energy modes.We would like to point out that the check for non-singularity of matrix M for element is necessary and cannot be ignored because only the requirement of nonzero-energy for every linearly independent deformation mode cannot guarantee that the resulting deformation field is zero-energy-free. This statement can be illustrated by an interesting example in Ref [42].The 2D 4-node quadrilateral hybrid element hasn=8degrees of freedom andr=3rigid body modes. So it hasm=n−r=5basic stress modes in Eq. (83). Note again that there are some unnecessary factors inside its stress field in Eq. (83), namely there are some unnecessary components inside the basic stress modes in Eq. (84), due to the fact that the displacement element behaves over rigidity. In order to take away these unnecessary components, they are broken into sub-modes where one of their components is used to construct one sub-mode as(130)(σ1′)1=C11σ¯1,(σ1′)2=C21σ¯2(σ2′)1=C12σ¯1,(σ2′)2=C22σ¯2(σ3′)3=2C33σ¯3(σ4′)1=C11σ¯7,(σ4′)2=C21σ¯8,(σ4′)3=C33σ¯6(σ5′)1=C21σ¯4,(σ5′)2=C22σ¯5,(σ5′)3=C33σ¯9(σi′)k=0forelsewhere the uniaxial stress modesσ¯i's by iso-function method are expressed as [13](131){σ¯1,σ¯2,…,σ¯9}={I3,xI3,yI3}=[100010001x000x000xy000y000y]in whichI3is the identity matrix of3×3. With these sub-modes, the basic stress modes in Eq. (84) can be expressed as(132)σi′=∑k=13(σi′)kfori=1,2,3,4,5Clearly, the sub-modes in Eq. (132) can only be essential because all of them are uniaxial. These sub-modes are compared with their original basic stress modes to determine the optimal stress modes to construct the assumed stress field for hybrid element. For the first basic deformation modea1, by Eq. (107) the following similarity degrees can be calculated as:(133)|cosθ11|=〈σ1′,S(σ1′)1〉||σ1′||S||(σ1′)1||S=〈σ1′,Sσ¯1〉||σ1′||S||σ¯1||S=EC|cosθ12|=〈σ1′,S(σ1′)2〉||σ1′||S||(σ1′)2||S=〈σ1′,Sσ¯2〉||σ1′||S||σ¯2||S=0where(134)〈σ1′,Sσ¯1〉=4,〈σ′1,Sσ¯2〉=0,||σ1′||S2=4C,||σ¯1||S2=||σ¯2||S2=4ESince(135)|cosθ11|>|cosθ12|Then(σ1′)1is more similar toσ1′than(σ1′)2is. It indicates(σ1′)1represents more features insideσ1′than(σ1′)2does. Therefore, by Eq. (135) the uniaxial modeσ¯1is selected as the optimal stress mode for hybrid element with respect toa1as(136)σ1=σ¯1={100}The cases fora2anda3are similar. By the similar procedures, their optimal stress modes can be derived, respectively, as(137)σ2=σ¯2={010},σ3=σ¯3={001}For the previous three basic deformation modes there is only one single sub-mode with nonzero similarity for each basic stress mode, respectively, so the relating uniaxial mode is the only necessary mode and the choice is simple. Fora4, the similarity degrees of(σ4′)1,(σ4′)2,(σ4′)3withσ′4based on our inner product can be obtained as:(138)|cosθ41|=〈σ4′,S(σ4′)1〉||σ4′||S||(σ4′)1||S=〈σ4′,Sσ¯7〉||σ4′||S||σ¯7||S=EC+G|cosθ42|=〈σ4′,S(σ4′)2〉||σ4′||S||(σ4′)2||S=〈σ4′,Sσ¯8〉||σ4′||S||σ¯8||S=0|cosθ43|=〈σ4′,S(σ4′)3〉||σ4′||S||(σ4′)3||S=〈σ4′,Sσ¯6〉||σ4′||S||σ¯6||S=GC+Gwhere(139)〈σ4′,Sσ¯7〉=43,〈σ4′,Sσ¯8〉=0,〈σ4′,Sσ¯6〉=43||σ4′||S2=4(C+G)3,||σ¯7||S2=||σ¯8||S2=43E,||σ¯6||S2=43GIt is found in Eq. (138) that there are two nonzero similarity degrees. However, consider Eq. (82) one has(140)|cosθ41|>|cosθ43|>|cosθ42|Then we find the expected optimal modes fora4as(141)σ4=σ¯7={y00}Obviously, by our systematic scheme, the parasitic shearτxy=Gxinσ4′is taken away automatically. Similarly, the optimal stress mode fora5can be derived as(142)σ5=σ¯5={0x0}In summary, the optimal assumed stress can be expressed as given in the following:(143)P={σ¯1,σ¯2,σ¯3,σ¯7,σ¯5}=[100y00100x00100]In fact the assumed stress modes in Eq. (143) are equivalent to Pian [12] as well as Wu et al. [23] and Huang [9] according to Proposition 1. The details to determine the optimal stress modes for 2D 4-node element with basic stress modes one by one are shown inTable 2, in which ‘NA’ means ‘not available’ and(144)d0=C,d1=C+GTo check whether or not the hybrid element is free from zero-energy mode, according to Eq. (127) the following matrix is calculated as:(145)M=[400000400000800000430000043]Since,(146)|M|=21132≠0According to Proposition 3, the resulting hybrid element is free of any zero-energy mode. The resulted hybrid stress element is denoted as QTY-Q4.Similar to the procedures for 2D 4-node quadrilateral element, to take away the unnecessary components inside the basic stress modes in Eq. (103) for 3D 8-node brick hybrid element, they are broken into the following sub-modes as:(147)(σ1′)1=C11σ¯1,(σ1′)2=C21σ¯2,(σ1′)3=C31σ¯3(σ2′)1=C12σ¯1,(σ2′)2=C22σ¯2,(σ2′)3=C32σ¯2(σ3′)1=C13σ¯1,(σ3′)2=C23σ¯2,(σ3′)3=C33σ¯3(σ4′)4=2C44σ¯4,(σ5′)5=2C55σ¯5,(σ6′)6=2C66σ¯6(σ7′)1=C11σ¯13,(σ7′)2=C21σ¯14,(σ7′)3=C31σ¯15,(σ7′)4=C44σ¯10(σ8′)1=C11σ¯19,(σ8′)2=C21σ¯20,(σ8′)3=C31σ¯21,(σ8′)6=C66σ¯12(σ9′)1=C11σ¯31,(σ9′)2=C21σ¯32,(σ9′)3=C31σ¯33,(σ9′)4=C44σ¯40,(σ9′)6=C66σ¯30(σ10′)1=C12σ¯19,(σ10′)2=C22σ¯20,(σ10′)3=C32σ¯21,(σ10′)5=C55σ¯17(σ11′)1=C12σ¯7,(σ11′)2=C22σ¯8,(σ11′)3=C32σ¯9,(σ11′)4=C44σ¯16(σ12′)1=C12σ¯37,(σ12′)2=C22σ¯38,(σ12′)3=C32σ¯39,(σ12′)4=C44σ¯34,(σ12′)5=C55σ¯29(σ13′)1=C13σ¯7,(σ13′)2=C23σ¯8,(σ13′)3=C33σ¯9,(σ13′)6=C66σ¯24(σ14′)1=C13σ¯13,(σ14′)2=C23σ¯14,(σ14′)3=C33σ¯15,(σ14′)5=C55σ¯23(σ15′)1=C13σ¯25,(σ15′)2=C23σ¯26,(σ15′)3=C33σ¯27,(σ15′)5=C55σ¯41,(σ15′)6=C66σ¯36(σ16′)4=2C44σ¯22,(σ17′)5=2C55σ¯11,(σ18′)6=2C66σ¯18(σi′)k=0forelsein which the uniaxial stress modes by iso-function method are expressed as [11](148){σ¯1,σ¯2,…,σ¯42}={I6,xI6,yI6,zI6,xyI6,yzI6,zxI6}in whichI6is the identity matrix of6×6. With these sub-modes, the basic stress modes in Eq. (103) can be expressed as(149)σi′=∑k=16(σi′)k(i=1,2,…,18)Then, the sub-modes are compared with their basic stress modes to select the optimal mode according to their similarity degrees. The details to determine the optimal modes with the basic stress modes one by one are provided inTable 3, in which ‘NA’ means ‘not available’ and(150)d0=C,d1=C+G,d2=C+2GFrom Table 3, the final optimal stress modes are expressed as(151)P={σ¯1,σ¯2,σ¯3,σ¯4,σ¯5,σ¯6,σ¯13,σ¯19,σ¯31,σ¯20,σ¯8,σ¯38,σ¯9,σ¯15,σ¯27,σ¯22,σ¯11,σ¯18}=[100000yzyz000000000010000000zxzx000000001000000000xyxy000000100000000000z000000100000000000x000000100000000000y]In fact the assumed stress modes in Eq. (151) are equivalent to Pian and Wu [17], Huang [9], and Hoa and Feng [11] according to Proposition 1. It is easy to verify the relating matrix(152)M={ρ1,ρ2,…,ρ18}=[M000000M100000M200000M300000M4]where(153)M0=[8I30016I3],M1=M2=M3=[83I30089],M4=163I3is nonsingular(154)|M|=260315≠0So, the element is free of zero-energy mode. The resulted hybrid stress element is denoted as QTY-H8.As mentioned earlier, to show the geometrical relationships of stress modes based on our inner product, we have to draw the modes with the transformation of matrix R, whereS=RTR. So, with such visual technique, it is possible to illustrate their differences from the conventional inner product.For example, the geometric relationships of the basic stress modeσ′1and its sub-modes(σ′1)1and(σ1′)2are shown inFig. 7 whereE=1andν=0.25so that(155)Λ=[0.750001.250002.50],Φ=[−0.7071−0.70710−0.70710.70710001]Thus(156)R=[−0.6124−0.61240−0.79060.79060001]It is found in Fig. 7 that, based on conventional inner product,(σ1′)2is not orthogonal toσ1′butR(σ1′)2is orthogonal toRσ1′. In fact, with the transformation by matrixR, our inner product betweenσ1′and(σ1′)2can be rewritten as(157)〈σ1′,S(σ1′)2〉=〈Rσ1′,R(σ1′)2〉=0This means that(σ′1)2is orthogonal toσ′1based on our inner product even though they are not based on the conventional inner product.It should be further noted that, based on the conventional energy product, the similarities of(σ4′)3,(σ4′)1,(σ4′)2orσ¯6,σ¯7,σ¯8with the basic strainε4can be derived as(158)|cosφ41|=〈ε4,(σ4′)1〉||ε4||||(σ4′)1||=〈ε4,σ¯7〉||ε4||||σ¯7||=22|cosφ42|=〈ε4,(σ4′)2〉||ε4||||(σ4′)2||=〈ε4,σ¯8〉||ε4||||σ¯8||=0|cosφ43|=〈ε4,(σ4′)3〉||ε4||||(σ4′)3||=〈ε4,σ¯6〉||ε4||||σ¯6||=22where(159)〈ε4,σ¯6〉=〈ε4,σ¯7〉=43,〈ε4,σ¯8〉=0,||σ¯6||=||σ¯7||=||σ¯8||=23,||ε4||=223Clearly,(σ4′)1and(σ4′)3orσ¯7andσ¯6result into the same similarities withε4due to their equal energy products, so it can be confusing to determine which one is better for the basic deformation modea4according to their orthogonality with the basic strain using the conventional energy product to make the final choice. However, based on our inner product, the similarity degrees of the sub-modes(σ4′)1,(σ4′)2, and(σ4′)3with their basic stress modeσ′4can be obtained in Eq. (138) and the optimal stress mode has been successfully selected in Eq. (141). Their relationships can be sketched with the visual technique inFig. 8 (since the modes are functions, they cannot be precisely drawn as arrows).It can be shown that(σ4′)1is more similar than(σ4′)3toσ4′becauseθ41<θ43. Besides,(σ4′)2is out of similarity toσ4′becauseθ42=90°. Therefore,(σ4′)1is most similar toσ4′. In other words, it represents the main features ofσ4′.As mentioned earlier, in the one-β (stress mode) per one-α (basic deformation mode) scheme by Pian and Chen [8], the parasitic shears are eliminated from the basic strain modes. However, such basic strain modes are not realistic because they cannot be derived from their basic deformation modes. In other words, their basic strain modes cannot be used to describe any strain for the element. The root for problem is that in the conventional inner product all the stresses and strains are considered as the mathematical vectors without any physical meaning. However, in our present quantitative method, the inner product with weighting matrix is employed to determine the optimal ones with the basic stress modes instead of the basic strain modes. That is different from one-β per one-α scheme by Pian and Chen [8]. It is proved that our basic stress mode method provides a novel rational way for optimal mode determination and selection.By means of Eq. (118) the sub-mode with nonzero similarity implies that its relating uniaxial mode is the basic strain-coupled assumed stress modes. And, according to Proposition 2, it can be used to suppress the relating zero-energy mode. Therefore, the uniaxial modes for the sub-mode with nonzero similarities in Tables 2 and 3 can be selected as the assumed stress modes for the hybrid element free from zero-energy [32,42]. From Table 2, there are some alternative choices for the 4-node hybrid quadrilateral element free of zero-energy modes as given in the following:(160)PI={σ¯1,σ¯2,σ¯3,σ¯6,σ¯5}=[100000100x001x0](161)PII={σ¯1,σ¯2,σ¯3,σ¯7,σ¯9}=[100y0010000010y](162)PIII={σ¯1,σ¯2,σ¯3,σ¯6,σ¯9}=[1000001000001xy]The resulting elements are denoted as QLTY-Q4-I, -II, and -III. Besides, from Table 3, there are some alternative choices for the 8-node hybrid solid elements free of zero-energy modes as given in the following:(163)P1={σ¯1,σ¯2,σ¯3,σ¯4,σ¯5,σ¯6,σ¯10,σ¯12,σ¯30,σ¯20,σ¯8,σ¯38,σ¯9,σ¯15,σ¯27,σ¯22,σ¯11,σ¯18}=[100000000000000000010000000zxzx000000001000000000xyxy000000100x00000000z000000100000000000x00000010xxy00000000y](164)P2={σ¯1,σ¯2,σ¯3,σ¯4,σ¯5,σ¯6,σ¯13,σ¯19,σ¯31,σ¯17,σ¯16,σ¯34,σ¯9,σ¯15,σ¯27,σ¯22,σ¯11,σ¯18}=[100000yzyz000000000010000000000000000001000000000xyxy0000001000000yyz000z00000010000y000000x000000100000000000y](165)P3={σ¯1,σ¯2,σ¯3,σ¯4,σ¯5,σ¯6,σ¯13,σ¯19,σ¯31,σ¯20,σ¯8,σ¯38,σ¯24,σ¯23,σ¯41,σ¯22,σ¯11,σ¯18}=[100000yzyz000000000010000000zxzx000000001000000000000000000100000000000z000000100000000zzx0x0000001000000z0000y]The resulting elements are denoted as QLTY-H8-1, -2, and -3. According to Proposition 3, it is easy to verify that all the series QLTY-Q4’s and QLTY-H8’s are free of zero-energy. It should be noted that these alternative elements cannot provide the satisfactory solutions for some cases so they are not suggested. We just provided them to compare the QTY-Q4 and QTY-H8 elements by our method with largest similarities.Two cantilever beams withE=1500andν=0.25are modeled by two irregular elements under different loading conditions as shown inFigs. 9 and 10, respectively. This test is used to examine the instability of numerical solutions caused by mesh distortions. Mesh distortion sensitivity of deflectionvAas well as stressσxBto the mesh distortion factoreare shown in Figs. 9 and 10. We can see that the elements QTY-Q4/P–S [12] and S–R by Simo and Rifi [43] provide fairly stable displacement and stress solutions. However, the elements QLTY-Q4-I, -II, and -III do not provide the satisfactory solutions because the parasitic shear stress modeσ¯6andσ¯9are selected instead of the bending stress modesσ¯7andσ¯5. In addition, IsoFun-Q4 [13] is almost equivalent to Q4. That is because all the basic stress modes are included in its assumed stress field.Consider the long beam test inFig. 11 suggested by MacNeal et al. [66]. Three different mesh shapes of discretization are adopted: (a) rectangular, (b) trapezoidal and (c) parallelogram. This example is a classic benchmark for testing the sensitivity to mesh distortion of 4-node quadrilateral membrane elements. Besides the distortion caused by the length–width ratio, a combined distortions of parallelogram and trapezoidal shapes together with length–width ratio are taken into account. There are two loading cases under consideration: pure bending and pure shearing forces, respectively. Young’s modulus of the beam isE=107; Poisson’s ratio,ν=0.3; and the thickness of the beam,t=0.1. The results of the tip deflection at point A are shown inTable 4. It is shown that for rectangular mesh the elements QTY-Q4/P–S [12] as well as Q6 [19], QM6 [20], HSF-Q4θ-7β[27], QUAD4 [66], and GQ12M8 [67] can obtain the satisfactory solutions. For distorted mesh, HSF-Q4θ-7β[27] can obtain the best answer for both parallelogram mesh and trapezoidal mesh, since it used seven analytical solutionsϕifor the stress functionϕwith seven unknown parametersβi. However, the QTY-Q4/P–S [12] element can only obtain the better solution for parallelogram mesh while the Q6 [19] and QM6 [20] elements only for trapezoidal mesh.This example, a tapered and swept panel with unit load uniformly distributed along right edge as shown inFig. 12, was proposed by Cook et al. [68]. The results of the stresses at points A and B as well as the vertical deflection at point C are listed inTable 5. It can be seen that Q4 and IsoFun-Q4 [13] elements always involve locking phenomena. However, compared with the results of other elements, the QTY-Q4/P–S [12] element as well as Q6 [19], QM6 [20], GQ12M8[67], and HSF-Q4θ-7β[27] elements can produce satisfactory answers, where GQ12M8 [67] and HSF-Q4θ-7β[27] much better. Noted that the solutions by the elements QLTY-Q4-I, -II, and -III which use the parasitic shear stress modes instead of the bending stress modes can be improved when the mesh is refined.A simple test for volumetric locking is given inFig. 13. This is an elastic plane-strain cantilever beam simply supported and subjected to pure bending. Young’s modulus isE=1500with different Poison’s ratio. The tip deflection at point A and the stresses at point B are provided inTables 6 and 7. When Poison’s ratio approaches 0.5, the solutions for improper elements Q4 and IsoFun-Q4 [13] will exhibit severe volumetric locking. As to the deflection, the element QTY-Q4/P–S [12] and Q6 [19], QM6 [20] as well as MECQ4/MLQ6/MHQM [69] can obtain the satisfactory answers. As to the stress, only QTY-Q4/P–S [12] can obtain the best solution. Moreover, the solutions by QLTY-Q4-I, -II, and -III can be greatly improved for the refined mesh.The 3D cantilever beam withE=1500andν=0.25are modeled by regular elements under pure bending conditions as shown inFig. 14. The results of tip deflection at point A and the stresses at point B are provided inTable 8. It is shown that QTY-H8 can provide the best solution, particularly for stress. It is also found that QLTY-H8-2 and -3 can obtain satisfactory answers while the solutions by QLTY-H8-1 are not true. This is because the true bending stress solution for this load case is included in the assumed stress fields for QLTY-H8-2 and -3 while the parasitic shear stresses are used instead for QLTY-H8-1.In conclusion, the proposed QTY-Q4 and QTY-H8 elements can provide the excellent solutions. However, the QLTY-Q4-I, -II, and -III elements as well as QLTY-H8-1, -2, and -3 elements cannot obtain the satisfactory answers, particularly for the coarse mesh, so that they are not suggested for stress analysis even though they are free of zero-energy modes. It should be noted that our proposed QTY-Q4 and QTY-H8 elements are equivalent to Pian and Sumihara [12], Wu and Cheung [23], and Huang [9]. Our attempt is to propose an innovative method with largest similarity based on our inner product to derive these elements. Since these existing elements have been investigated and compared with a lot of other elements [42], we mainly compare them with those of less similarities to verify our method. It is proved that our method is systematic and it provides quantitative information as to the similarity of the optimal stress modes. Further we believe that the availability of this method will allow us to systematically derive the optimal stress modes for more complicated elements such as 8-node 2D and 20-node 3D elements.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A new inner product with the material matrix as the weighting matrix is introduced to reveal the relationship quantitatively between the different stress modes. The associated norm of stress mode has the specific physical meaning as its flexibility. Besides, the basic deformation modes are derived using the curl from the element displacement field. Then the relating basic stress modes are considered in the analysis instead of the basic strain modes in the conventional hybrid finite element formulation. In order to obtain the optimal stress modes, the basic stress modes are broken into a set of sub-modes, where the necessary and unnecessary modes are independent to each other because they are uniaxial. Then the similarity degree based on the proposed inner product is used to investigate the relationships between the sub-modes with their basic stress modes. The sub-mode with largest similarity degree with the basic stress mode implies that it represents the most important features inside the basic stress mode. Thus it is selected as the optimal stress mode for hybrid elements. The proposed method is straightforward to investigate the basic stress modes from displacement element and determine the optimal stress modes for hybrid stress elements. This is in contrast with the methods based on the conventional energy product as well as the modal technique which can be only used to select all the stress modes to suppress the zero-energy deformation but they cannot be used to determine the optimal modes. The present method was demonstrated through 2D 4-node quadrilateral elements and 3D 8-node brick elements. In addition, some numerical examples are introduced to illustrate the element performances of different assumed stress fields.
