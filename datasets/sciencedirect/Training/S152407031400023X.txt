@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we present an efficient approach for parameterizing a genus-zero triangular mesh onto the sphere with an optimal radius in an as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) manner, which is an extension of planar ARAP parametrization approach to spherical domain. We analyze the smooth and discrete ARAP energy and formulate our spherical parametrization energy from the discrete ARAP energy. The solution is non-trivial as the energy involves a large system of non-linear equations with additional spherical constraints. To this end, we propose a two-step iterative algorithm. In the first step, we adopt a local/global iterative scheme to calculate the parametrization coordinates. In the second step, we optimize a best approximate sphere on which parametrization triangles can be embedded in a rigidity-preserving manner. Our algorithm is simple, robust, and efficient. Experimental results show that our approach provides almost isometric spherical parametrizations with lowest rigidity distortion over state-of-the-art approaches.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Parametrization is essential for geometry processing and has wide applications in various fields, including texture mapping, texture synthesis, detail transfer, mesh completion, remeshing, surface approximation, scattered data fitting, and morphing, etc.The problem of mesh parametrization is to compute a one-to-one mapping from a given mesh to a suitable domain. The most commonly used mesh is triangular mesh, and the mappings are required to be at least piecewise linear, so we only need to compute the vertex coordinates.The parametrization of a closed genus-zero manifold triangular mesh preferably is done on its natural domain: the spherical domain. Many applications are quite sensitive to discontinuities in the parametrization, or cannot tolerate them at all. The big advantage of the spherical domain over the planar one is that it allows for seamless, continuous parametrization of genus-zero models, and there are a large number of such models in use [1].As we have known, the common goal of parametrization is to find a mapping which minimizes some metric distortion of the original mesh. There are various types of parametrization methodologies, such as authalic (area-preserving) mapping, conformal (angle-preserving) mapping, isometric (length-preserving) mapping, and some combination of these [2]. In this paper, we aim to parameterize a genus-zero triangular mesh onto a sphere in an as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) manner.Specifically, we extend the ARAP planar parametrization method [2,3] to spherical domain. In the planar case, the ARAP parametrization [2] minimizes an “intrinsic” deformation energy function which can be expressed in terms of the singular values of the Jacobian of the parametrization. Unfortunately, the extension to the sphere is not straightforward. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to the planar case, we need to optimize a radius of the sphere on which parametrization triangles can be embedded on in a rigidity-preserving manner.After we formulate the smooth ARAP spherical parametrization energy, we propose the discrete variational description of the energy. We use a two-step iterative algorithm to solve the non-linear problem with additional spherical constraints. An optimal radius of the sphere is obtained to guarantee the rigidity of the parametrization. Experimental results show that our ARAP parametrization approach always gives the lowest rigidity distortion compared with state-of-the-art approaches [4–7].
