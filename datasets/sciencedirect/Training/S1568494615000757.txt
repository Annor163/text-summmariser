@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach is regarded as a main part of modern decision science and operational research. Due to the complexity of socio-economic environment, multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) has become a critical issue recently.Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), developed by Hwang and Yoon [23], is a well-known method for MCDM. In the classical TOPSIS, the decision information can only be expressed with crisp values. However, in the real MCGDM problems, the information available to decision makers are always imprecise and vague. It is unreasonable to express the preferences with crisp values, so the classical TOPSIS method is not applicable for this issue. Furthermore, compared with single MCDM, MCGDM is much more complicated as it consists of multiple experts’ subjective judgment and preferences which are often imprecise and vague [36]. Thus, it is necessary to provide some simple and logical mathematical tools for MCGDM under uncertain environment.Fuzzy set theory proposed by Zadeh [46] can handle vague and imprecise situation, so many researches extend TOPSIS method to fuzzy environment [3,5,9–11,14,15,24–27,29,32,33,35,36,39,42]. Due to the complexity of socio-economic environment, in many practical MCGDM problems, there may hesitation about preferences. In such case, intuitionistic fuzzy set, as an extension of Zadeh's fuzzy set, introduced by Atanassov [4] can be suitable and convenient to express the decision makers’ preferences. Recently, intuitionistic fuzzy set has received more and more attention. Accordingly, many researchers have investigated the extended TOPSIS method with intuitionistic fuzzy set such as Boran et al. [8], Park et al. [31], Tan [34] and Ye [44].However, both the fuzzy set and intuitionistic fuzzy set only use discrete domains. Fuzzy numbers are a special case of fuzzy sets and are of importance for fuzzy MCDM problems [1,2,16,37]. Nehi and Maleki [30] introduced trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers as extension of intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers. The triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers and trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are the extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets in another way, which extends discrete set to continuous set [38,45].Therefore, in our previous works, we try to construct MCGDM methods based on TOPSIS and trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy information [12,28]. In the proposed MCGDM methods, the preference information is expressed with trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers.However, the above MCGDM methods based on TOPSIS did not take account of the conflict of decision information. The decision makers may be from different fields, so there may be differences in their knowledge structure, preferences, the degree of understanding of the problem and the evaluation ability. What is more, due to the complexity of the problem, there can be significant differences among different decision makers. If there are decision makers whose opinions are significantly different from the group opinion, the aggregated group opinion may come to conclusions which do not meet the reality [20]. The group consistency is directly related to the results of group decision making, thus group consistency analysis research has attracted more and more attention of scholars in recent years, such as García et al. [17]; Herrera et al. [19]; Herrera-Viedma et al. [21,22]; Xu [41]; Ben-Arieh and Easton [6]; Ben-Arieh and Chen [7]. According to the existing achievements, most of the research explores the group consistency problem based on reciprocal judgment matrix, complementary judgment matrix and linguistic judgment matrix. But there is little research on the group consistency analysis based on decision matrix, and, with respect to the form of criteria information, the existing research is based on crisp values, interval numbers and linguistic values, and the consistency analysis in MCGDM problems with trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy information does not appear. The calculation of group consistency degree in most studies does not take account of the alternative ranking position which is of great importance in group consistency analysis [20]. Nowadays, the decision makers whose opinions are different from group opinion are required to modify the preference information in lots of consistency analysis algorithms, without taking account of the possibility that the minority may be right.So the main purpose of this paper is to develop a group consistency analysis procedure based on trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy information, and propose a new MCGDM model by using consistency analysis as the preceding step of the extended trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method. Specifically, the proposed MCGDM model is divided into three interrelated modules: weight determining mechanism, group consistency analysis, and ranking and selection procedure. For the first module, distance measures, expected values and arithmetic averaging operator for trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used to determine the weight values of criteria and decision makers. For the second module, a consistency analysis and correction procedure based on trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator and OWA operator is developed to reduce the influence of conflicting opinions prior to the ranking process. For the third module, a trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS is used for ranking and selection. Then we develop an algorithm for ranking alternatives under trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Finally, a numerical example further illustrates the practicality and efficiency of the proposed method.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we firstly introduced some basic notations and preliminary definition of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In Section 3, a new MCGDM model based on trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy information is proposed. In Section 4, an illustrative example shows the feasibility and availability of the proposed method. The paper is concluded in Section 5.Some basic definitions of intuitionistic fuzzy sets [4], fuzzy numbers [16], intuitionistic fuzzy numbers [18] and trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers [30] are introduced in this section.Definition 1[4]Let a set X be fixed. An intuitionistic fuzzy set A in X is defined as:(1)A={〈X,μA(x),νA(x)|x∈X〉},where the functionsμA(x):X→[0,1],νA(x):X→[0,1]are the degree of membership and non-membership of the elementx∈X,respectively, satisfying0≤μA(x)+νA(x)≤1,for allx∈X.We callπA(x)=1−μA(x)−νA(x)the intuitionistic fuzzy index of x to A, which represents the degree of hesitancy of x.Let A be a fuzzy number on a real number set R, its membership is defined as follows:(2)μA(x)=0x<a1fA(x),a1≤x<a21,a2≤x≤a3gA(x),a3<x≤a40x>a4wherea1,a2,a3,a4∈R,fA(x):X→[0,1],gA(x):X→[0,1]are called the left side and the right side of a fuzzy number A, respectively. And fAis nondecreasing continuous function, gAis nonincreasing continuous function, respectively.Let A be an intuitionistic fuzzy number on a real number set R, its membership and non-membership are defined as follows:(3)μA(x)=0x<a1fA(x),a1≤x<a21,a2≤x≤a3gA(x),a3<x≤a40x>a4(4)vA(x)=1x<b1hA(x),b1≤x<b20,b2≤x≤b3kA(x),b3<x≤b41x>b4where0≤μA(x)≤1,0≤vA(x)≤1,μA(x)+vA(x)≤1.a1,a2,a3,a4,b1,b2,b3,b4∈R,such thatb1≤a1≤b2≤a2≤a3≤b3≤a4≤b4and four functionsfA,gA,hA,kA:R→[0,1]are called the sides of a fuzzy number. AndfA,kAare nondecreasing continuous function,gA,hA,are nonincreasing continuous function.The α-cuts provide a useful tool for dealing with fuzzy numbers. As for intuitionistic fuzzy number, it is necessary to distinguish following α-cuts:(A+)αand(A−)α.Definition 4[30]The α-cuts of the intuitionistic fuzzy number A on a real number set R is defined as follows:(5)(A+)α={x∈R|μA(x)≥α}(6)(A−)α={x∈R|1−vA(x)≥α}According to Definition 4, every α-cut is a closed interval. Hence, we have(A+)α=[AL+(α),AU+(α)]and(A−)α=[AL−(α),AU−(α)], respectively, where(7)AL+(α)=inf(x∈R|μA(x)≥α)(8)AU+(α)=sup(x∈R|μA(x)≥α)(9)AL−(α)=inf{x∈R|1−vA(x)≥α}(10)AU−(α)=sup{x∈R|1−vA(x)≥α}Definition 5[30]Let A be a trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy number with parametersb1≤a1≤b2≤a2≤a3≤b3≤a4≤b4and denoted asA=〈(a1,a2,a3,a4),(b1,b2,b3,b4)〉on a real number set R, then its membership and non-membership are defined as follows:(11)μA(x)=0x<a1x−a1a2−a1,a1≤x<a21,a2≤x≤a3x−a4a3−a4,a3<x≤a40x>a4(12)vA(x)=1x<b1x−b1b1−b2,b1≤x<b20,b2≤x≤b3x−b3b4−b3,b3<x≤b41x>b4The following properties for trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are provided by Nehi and Maleki [30].Let A1 and A2 be two trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbersA1=〈(a11,a12,a13,a14),(b11,b12,b13,b14)〉,A2=〈(a21,a22,a23,a24),(b21,b22,b23,b24)〉;then we have(13)A1⊕A2=〈(a11+a21,a12+a22,a13+a23,a14+a24),(b11+b21,b12+b22,b13+b23,b14+b24)〉,(14)λA1=〈(λa11,λa12,λa13,λa14),(λb11,λb12,λb13,λb14)〉,λ>0.According to the operational laws of Definition 6, Wang and Zhang [38] proposed the trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (TrIFWA) operator, which is defined as follows:Definition 7LetAi(i=1,2,…,n)be a collection of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, andw=(w1,w2,…,wn)Tbe the weight vector of Ai, then the TrIFWA operator are defined as follows:(15)TrIFWA(A1,A2,…,An)=w1A1⊕w2A2⊕⋯⊕wnAnIfwi=1/nfor alli=1,2,…,n,then the TrIFWA operator reduces to trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic averaging (TrIFA) operator as follows:(16)TrIFA(A1,A2,…,An)=1n(A1⊕A2⊕⋯⊕An)According to Ye [45], the expected value of a trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numberA=〈(a1,a2,a3,a4),(b1,b2,b3,b4)〉can be obtained by(17)EV(A)=18(a1+a2+a3+a4+b1+b2+b3+b4)Based on expected value of a trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy number, Grzegrorzewski [18] gave the following orders.Let≻Land≻Udenote the quasi-order with respect to the lower and upper horizon, respectively, based on the metric d1. Then for two intuitionistic fuzzy numbers A and B, we get the following orders:(18)A≻LB⇔EV(A)≥EV(B)(19)A≻UB⇔EV(A)≥EV(B)Distance measure between two trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers can be defined by using the α-cuts of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers [12,28].Let A and B be two trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers with α-cuts representations, then the distance between A and B is defined as follows:(20)D(A,B)=14∫01[(AL+(α)−BL+(α))2+(AR+(α)−BR+(α))2+(AL−(α)−BL−(α))2+(AR−(α)−BR−(α))2]dαLet A1 and A2 be two trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy number,A1=〈(a11,a12,a13,a14),(b11,b12,b13,b14)〉,A2=〈(a21,a22,a23,a24),(b21,b22,b23,b24)〉. Thus, the distance between A1 and A2 is obtained by(21)D(A1,A2)=112∑i=14(a2i−a1i)2+∑i=14(b2i−b1i)2+∑i∈{1,3}(a2i−a1i)(a2i′−a1i′)+∑i∈{1,3}(b2i−b1i)(b2i′−b1i′)wherei′=i+1for alli∈{1,3}.For the MCGDM problem, the final decision should result from the preferences of a group of decision makers. However, it is difficult for the decision makers to determine the preferences with crisp values because the information available for decision makers is vague and imprecise under uncertain environment. Hence, the linguistic terms expressed in trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers can be used to construct decision matrix for each decision maker. In the MCGDM problem, many experts are involved. Different experts may have different knowledge and experience, and then they may be actual experts in some of the criteria but not in other criteria. Then it is not reasonable to set weights of experts beforehand (see Chen and Yang [13]). Further, there can be significant differences among different decision makers. During the process of MCGDM, the case of “the truth be held in minority” should be considered. So in this section, we develop a group consistency analysis procedure and propose a new MCGDM model by using consistency analysis as the preceding step of the trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method.For a MCGDM problem, letO={o1,o2,…,om}be a set of alternatives,C={c1,c2,…,cn}be n decision criteria,D={d1,d2,…,dq}be the set of decision makers, q be the number of decision makers,Rk=(rijk)m×nbe the decision matrix of decision makerdk(k=1,2,…,q)in which rijk(i=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n)is a trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy number provided by decision maker dkfor the alternative oion the criteria cj.With these notations, we introduce our trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy MCGDM approach in the following section.The first important problem is to determine the weights of criteria. In order to obtain the weights of criteria, decision makers give their own options for the importance of the criteria expressed with trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Assumeζjkrepresents the importance of criterion cjprovided by decision maker dk. Then the weight value of criterion cj, denoted asξj,can be obtained by using TrIFA operator in Definition 7:(22)ξj=TrIFA(ζj1,ζj2,…,ζjq)=1q(ζj1⊕ζj2⊕⋯⊕ζjq),for alljBy using formula (17), the expected weight valueEV(ξj)is obtained for criterion cj. Then the normalized expected weight valueξj'can be obtained by following formula:(23)ξ′j=EV(ξj)∑j=1nEV(ξj),for alljIn order to compare the consistency of decision makers in the alternative-level, we first use TrIFWA operator to aggregate preferences of individual decision maker. The overall preference value of decision maker dkon alternative oi, denoted asℏ˜ik,can be obtained by the following formula:(24)ℏ˜ik=TrIFWA(ri1k,ri2k,…,rink),for alliandkThe consistency degree between dkanddℓon alternative oican be reflected by the distance betweenℏ˜iℓandℏ˜ik.Definition 10Supposeℏ˜iℓandℏ˜ikare the overall preference value of decision makerdℓand dkon alternative oi, then consistency degree between dkanddℓon alternative oi, denoted asSiℓk,can be obtained by(25)Siℓk=1−d(ℏ˜iℓ,ℏ˜ik),for alli,ℓandkwhered(⋅)is the distance between two trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers in Definition 9.LetSiℓkbe the consistency degree between dkanddℓon alternative oi, then the mean consistency degree of decision maker dkon alternative oi, denoted as CEik, can be defined by(26)CEik=1q−1∑ℓ=1qSiℓk−1,for alliandkBased on the definition of mean consistency degree of decision maker dkon alternative oi, we can give the definition of mean consistency degree of alternative oi.Let CEikbe the mean consistency degree of decision maker dkon alternative oi, then the mean consistency degree of alternative oi, denoted as CAican be defined by(27)CAi=1q∑k=1qCEik,for alliIn order to construct group consistency degree, we need to aggregate the mean consistency degree of each alternative oi. Considering the importance of alternative ranking position in consistency analysis [20], in this paper, OWA operator [43] is used to aggregate the mean consistency degree of alternative oi.Let CAibe the mean consistency degree of alternative oi, then the group consistency degree, denoted as CI, can be defined by(28)CI=OWA(CA1,CA2,…,CAm)Here we can use the normal distribution method [40] to determine the weighting vector for OWA operator.In a complex and uncertain environment, due to the differences between decision makers such as field of research, knowledge structure, level of evaluation, as well as complexity of objective world, the group consistency degree is difficult to achieve complete consistency. In order to achieve a satisfactory consistency, CI should no less than a threshold value.Definition 14Let CI be the group consistency degree, given the acceptable consistency threshold value δ, ifCI≥δ,then we say the group judgment is consistent; otherwise, the group judgment is inconsistent.The acceptable consistency threshold value δ is usually chosen based on experience. If δ=1 then a complete group consistency is required to achieve.The modification of decision information can be always divided into two phases, the recognition phase and information modifying phase.In order to identify the decision makers who may need to modify the preferences, firstly, to find out the alternativeoi1which has the minimum value of CAi, and then find out the decision makerdk1who has the minimum value ofCEi1k;then the decision information of decision makerdk1on the alternativeoi1has the largest conflict with group opinion.Considering the possibility that the minority of the decision makers may be right, we chose conflict resolution in interactive mode. In this modifying phase, firstly,dk1is chosen to elaborate his opinion about preferences on the alternativeoi1,then the decision maker with maximum difference fromdk1is also chosen to express his opinion. After the elaboration, all decision makers can modify their preferences.In real situation, group decision making is a process of repeated modification. In order to avoid the excessive modification, we set a maximum number of iterations, denoted by z. Ifg≤zandCI≥δthen the decision makers achieve a group consistency. Only ifCI<δandg<z,can decision makers modify their decision information. Ifg>zandCI<δthen group consistency has not yet achieved. In order to avoid the excessive modification, each decision maker has only one chance to express his opinion.Below we give the procedure of group consistency analysis under trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy environment.Procedure IInput: Trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixRk=(rijk)m×n,the maximum number of iterations z, the acceptable consistency threshold value δ.Output: The corrected trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixRk(g)=(rijk(g))m×n,the number of iterations g, group consistency degreeCI(g)Step 1. Let g=0,Γi=∅,Rk(0)=(rijk(0))m×n=(rijk)m×n.Step 2. Calculate trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy matrixℜ(g)=(ℏ˜ik(g))m×q,whereℏ˜ik(g)=TrIFWA(ri1k(g),ri2k(g),…,rink(g))Step 3. According to Definition 10, calculateSiℓk(g)bySiℓk(g)=1−d(ℏ˜iℓ(g),ℏ˜ik(g)),whered(⋅)is the distance between two trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers in Definition 9.Step 4. According to formula (26), calculateCEik(g)byCEik(g)=1q−1∑ℓ=1qSiℓk(g)−1Having obtainingCEik(g),according to formula (27), calculateCAi(g)byCAi(g)=1q∑k=1qCEik(g)Then based onCAi(g),according to formula (28), calculateCI(g)byCI(g)=OWA(CA1(g),CA2(g),…,CAm(g))IfCI(g)≥δorg≥z, go to Step 8. Otherwise, ifg<zthen go to next step.Step 5. Letrijk(g+1)=rijk(g),τ=argmini(CAi(g)), if|Γτ|=q, then go to Step 8. Otherwise, go to next step.Step 6. Let℘=argmink(CEτk(g)|k∉Γτ),ℵ=argminℓ(Sτℓ℘(g)|ℓ∉Γτ), thend℘anddℵneed to elaborate on alternativeoτ. Any decision maker can re-edit criteria preference information about the alternativeoτ. supposer'τjk(g)is the modified attribute preference information. Letrτjk(g+1)=r'τjk(g)andΓτ=Γτ∪{℘,ℵ}.Step 7. By Step 6, we getRk(g+1)=(rijk(g+1))m×n. Let g=g+1g. Go to Step 2.Step 8. Output g,CI(g)andRk(g).End.According to Chen and Yang [13], the preference value close to the mean value would have a large weight, and the preference value far from the mean value would have a small weight. Suppose that rijkis the preferences of alternative oion the criteria cjprovided by decision maker dk. Then the mean value of the preference valuer′ijof alternative oion the criteria cjcan be computed by TrIFA operator in formula (16).(29)r′ij=TrIFA(rij1,rij2,…,rijq),for alliandjThen we can compute the similarity of the preference vectorℤjk=(r1jk,r2jk,…,rmjk)and the mean preference vectorℤ′j=(r′1j,r′2j,…,r′mj)by using similarity measure defined by:(30)S(ℤjk,ℤ′j)=1−1m∑i=1mD(rijk,r′ij),for alljandkwhereD(rijk,r′ij)is the distance betweenrijkandr′ij.Then the weight of decision maker dkon the criteria cjcan be computed as follows:(31)wjk=S(ℤjk,ℤ′j)∑k=1qS(ℤjk,ℤ′j),for alljandkIn [28], there's a similar method to determine weights of decision makers; but in this method, one decision maker will have a high and a low importance for the same criterion, which contradicts with the basic idea of why it is decided to rate the experts differently with respect to the criteria (see Chen and Yang [13]). Our proposed method in this paper can cope with this problem.In the MCGDM, all the individual decision opinions need to be aggregated into a group decision opinion. The TrIFWA operator defined in Definition 7 can be used to construct aggregated trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrixR=(rij)m×nas follows:(32)rij=TrIFWA(rij1,rij2,…,rijq)=wj1rij1⊕wj2rij2⊕⋯⊕wjqrijq,for alliandjIn the TOPSIS, positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS) are hypothesized and distance measures are used. The basic idea of TOPSIS is that the chosen alternative should be closest to the PIS and farthest from NIS. So we should identify the PIS and NIS and define the separation measures.The PIS and NIS can be identified as:(33)R+=(r1+,r2+,…,rn+)(34)R−=(r1−,r2−,…,rn−)Suppose thatrij=〈(aij1,aij2,aij3,aij4),(bij1,bij2,bij3,bij4)〉. According to [28], when the jth criterion is the benefit criteria, then(35)rj+=〈(maxiaij1,maxiaij2,maxiaij3,maxiaij4),(maxibij1,maxibij2,maxibij3,maxibij4)〉(36)rj−=〈(miniaij1,miniaij2,miniaij3,miniaij4),(minibij1,minibij2,minibij3,minibij4)〉when the jth criterion is the cost criteria, then(37)rj+=〈(miniaij1,miniaij2,miniaij3,miniaij4),(minibij1,minibij2,minibij3,minibij4)〉(38)rj−=〈(maxiaij1,maxiaij2,maxiaij3,maxiaij4),(maxibij1,maxibij2,maxibij3,maxibij4)〉According to Definition 9, we can define the separation measures between alternative oiand the ideal solution.Definition 15The weighted positive separation measure between alternative oiand the PIS is defined as follows:(39)Di+=∑j=1nξj'D(rij,rj+)whereD(rij,rj+)is the distance between rijandrj+defined in Definition 9,ξj'is the normalized expected weight value which can be obtained by using formula (23), andi=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n.The weighted negative separation measure between alternative oiand the NIS is defined as follows:(40)Di−=∑j=1nξj'D(rij,rj−)whereD(rij,rj−)is the distance between rijandrj−defined in Definition 9,ξj'is the normalized expected weight value which can be obtained by using formula (23), andi=1,2,…,m;j=1,2,…,n.Then a relative closeness coefficient of alternative oiwith respect to ideal alternatives is defined as follows:(41)Ui−=Di−Di++Di−,for alliIt is obvious that we can rank the alternatives according to the relative closeness coefficient.Procedure IIStep 1. Give decision matrix and weights of criteria according to linguistic values of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers.Step 2. Determine the normalized expected weight value of criteria by using formulae (22) and (23).Step 3. Run Procedure I.Step 4. Determine the weights of decision makers by using formulae (29), (30), and (31).Step 5. Construct aggregated trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix by using formula (32).Step 6. Identify the PIS and NIS by using formulae (33) and (34).Step 7. Calculate weighted positive and negative separation measures by using formulae (39) and (40).Step 8. Calculate relative closeness coefficient of each alternative by using formula (41).Step 9. Rank the alternatives according to the relative closeness coefficient.In this section, we still use the software selection problem discussed in [28] to illustrative the proposed MCGDM method.Now suppose that a computer center wants to select the most appropriate information system to enhance work efficiency. After pre-evaluation, four information systems{o1,o2,o3,o4}have remained as alternatives for further selection. The four possible alternatives can be evaluated under three criteria: (1) c1 is the cost of software and hardware; (2) c2 is the contribution to organizational performance improvement; (3) c3 is the software developer reliability.According to Procedure II, software selection using the new MCGDM model based on consistency analysis contains the following steps:Step 1. Suppose we invite four experts to consider the possible alternatives. According to Ye [45], linguistic values of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers for linguistic terms are shown in Table 1. Each expert gives the reference values and the weights of criteria with linguistic terms. Then the decision matrix and weights of criteria for each decision maker are shown in Tables 2–6.Step 2. Determine the normalized expected weight value of criteria. Based on the importance of criteria(ζjk)provided by decision maker dk, we first computeξjwhich represents the weight value of criterion cjby using formula (22), and then the normalized expected weight valueξj'can be obtained by following formula (23), then we getξ′1=0.3924,ξ′2=0.2684,ξ′3=0.3392.Step 3. Set z=4 and δ=0.88. Run Procedure I. When g=0, the result isCI(0)=0.867.BecauseCI(0)<δ, there is a need for interactive discussion. The program requires the decision maker d4 and d1 to elaborate on alternative o1. After the elaboration the decision maker d4 makes the following changes to his preference information:r′114(0)=〈(0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8),(0.4,0.6,0.7,0.9)〉andr′134(0)=〈(0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6),(0.2,0.4,0.5,0.7)〉and other decision makers haven’t modified their initial decision-making information. When g=1, the result isCI(1)=0.888.BecauseCI(1)>δ, at this point the trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy MCGDM achieves a satisfactory consistency.Step 4. Determine the weights of decision makers by using formulae (29), (30), and (31). Weights of the decision makers on this MCGDM are shown as follows:(wjk)3×4=0.24630.23870.26850.24650.27310.23240.24360.25090.23470.25630.25270.2563.Step 5. Based on the final decision matrix obtained in Step 3 and weights of decision makers in Step 4, the aggregated trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy decision matrix based on each expert's opinion is constructed by using formula (32) as follows:R=〈(0.35,0.45,0.55,0.65),(0.25,0.45,0.55,0.75)〉(0.45,0.55,0.65,0.75),(0.38,0.55,0.65,0.83)〈(0.25,0.35,0.45,0.55),(0.15,0.35,0.45,0.65)〉〈(0.34,0.44,0.54,0.64),(0.27,0.44,0.54,0.72)〉(0.43,0.53,0.63,0.73),(0.38,0.53,0.63,0.78)〈(0.35,0.45,0.55,0.65),(0.25,0.45,0.55,0.75)〉〈(0.30,0.40,0.50,0.60),(0.23,0.40,0.50,0.68)〉(0.65,0.75,0.85,0.95),(0.62,0.75,0.85,0.97)〈(0.28,0.38,0.48,0.58),(0.20,0.38,0.48,0.66)〉〈(0.45,0.55,0.65,0.75),(0.37,0.55,0.65,0.83)〉(0.34,0.44,0.54,0.64),(0.27,0.44,0.54,0.72)〈(0.32,0.42,0.52,0.62),(0.25,0.42,0.52,0.69)〉Step 6. Identify the PIS and NIS. c1 is cost criterion, c2 and c3 are benefit criteria. Then the PIS and NIS are obtained as follows:R+={〈(0.30,0.40,0.50,0.60),(0.23,0.40,0.50,0.68)〉,〈(0.65,0.75,0.85,0.95),(0.62,0.75,0.85,0.97)〉,〈(0.35,0.45,0.55,0.65),(0.25,0.45,0.55,0.75)〉}R−={〈(0.45,0.55,0.65,0.75),(0.37,0.55,0.65,0.83)〉,〈(0.34,0.44,0.54,0.64),(0.27,0.44,0.54,0.72)〉,〈(0.25,0.35,0.45,0.55),(0.15,0.35,0.45,0.65)〉}Step 7. By using formulae (39) and (40), negative and positive weighted separation measures are shown in Table 7.Step 8. The relative closeness coefficientUi−of each alternative oiare obtained as shown in Table 7.Step 9. SinceU3−>U2−>U1−>U4−, the rank of the alternatives is accordinglyo3≻o2≻o1≻o4.Thus the best alternative is o3.Being different from the previous MCGDM approaches with crisp values, interval values, fuzzy numbers and intuitionistic fuzzy values, this proposed MCGDM model uses trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers to represent decision-making information. Because the trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy number is extension of fuzzy number and intuitionistic fuzzy set, the proposed MCGDM model can deal with more abundant and flexible information. Meanwhile, the proposed MCGDM model uses consistency analysis as the preceding step of the extended trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method, which can effectively avoid the failure caused by the use of inconsistent decision information and provides a decision-making idea for the case of “the truth be held in minority”. Also, in our proposed method, the weights of decision makers are not set beforehand and attribute weights are given by decision makers through trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, which can enhance the flexibility and practicality of the model under uncertain environment.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
MCGDM is a critical issue in complexity of socio-economic environment. In the real MCGDM problems, the information available to decision makers are always imprecise and vague. It is unreasonable to express the preferences of alternatives on criteria with exact and crisp values, so the traditional methods of MCGDM are not useful for this issue. Therefore, in this study, we use trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers for MCGDM problems. Taking into account the conflicting opinions that may exist among decision makers and the case of “the truth be held in minority”, we propose a new MCGDM model by using consistency analysis as the preceding step of the trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS method and develop a procedure to determine the most appropriate alternative among all possible alternatives.In the proposed MCGDM model, the preference values and the weight values of criteria take the form of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Being extension of fuzzy numbers and intuitionistic fuzzy sets, trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers can express more abundant and flexible information than fuzzy numbers and intuitionistic fuzzy sets. In existing MCGDM methods, the weights of decision makers always set beforehand. In our proposed model, distance measure is used to determine weights of decision makers. As for weights of criteria, in our study, the weights are given by experts using linguistic values of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, and the expected weight value is obtained by using TrIFA operator and expected value of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Based on distance measures, weighted separation measures are defined. Further, in order to reduce the influence of conflicting opinions prior to the ranking process, a consistency analysis and correction procedure based on TrIFWA operator and OWA operator is developed. Then based on the relative closeness coefﬁcients of alternatives, alternatives are ranked. A numerical example further illustrates the practicality and efﬁciency of the new MCGDM method.The proposed method can cope with MCGDM problems under uncertain environment. In particular, it can effectively avoid the failure caused by the use of inconsistent decision information and provides a decision-making idea for the case of “the truth be held in minority”.
