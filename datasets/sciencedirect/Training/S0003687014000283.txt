The prevalence of reduced demand-specific work ability ranged from 9% to 21%.Depression was associated with six measures of reduced demand-specific work ability.Musculoskeletal pain was associated with four measures of reduced demand-specific work ability.Poor health and working conditions did not interact regarding reduced demand-specific work ability.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We investigated the prevalence of reduced demand-specific work ability, its association with age, gender, education, poor health, and working conditions, and the interaction between poor health and working conditions regarding reduced demand-specific work ability. We used cross-sectional questionnaire data from 3381 full-time employees responding to questions about vocational education, job demands and social support (working conditions), musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and major depression (MD) (poor health) and seven questions about difficulty managing different job demands (reduced demand-specific work ability). Reduced demand-specific work ability varied from 9% to 19% among the 46-year old and from 11% to 21% among the 56-year old. Age was associated with two, gender with four, and education with all measures of reduced demand-specific work ability. MSP was associated with four and MD was associated with six measures of reduced demand-specific work ability. We found no interaction between working conditions and poor health regarding reduced demand-specific work ability.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Work ability reflects the balance between personal resources and job demands (Tengland, 2011; van den Berg et al., 2009). Previous studies show that both low personal resources, e.g. depressive symptoms and musculoskeletal pain, and demanding working conditions, e.g. high mental work load, high physical work load, low social support, and low work spirit, are associated with decreased work ability (Deyo and Weinstein, 2001; Elinson et al., 2004; Martimo et al., 2007; Martinez and Latorre, 2006; Miranda et al., 2010; van den Berg et al., 2008; van den Berg et al., 2009). Still, the potential interaction between low personal resources and high job demands when predicting poor work ability is seldom investigated. We hypothesize that low personal resources, as depression and musculoskeletal pain, have a larger negative effect on work ability under conditions of high job demands than under conditions of low job demands.Reduced work ability is not necessarily global (Tengland, 2011). An employee's work ability can be reduced with regard to certain job demands but unaffected with regard to other job demands. Additionally, different health problems may have different effects on work ability. In theory, depressive symptoms will directly affect a person's cognitive function and thereby the ability to manage cognitive work tasks (McDermott and Ebmeier, 2009), while musculoskeletal pain affects a person's physical function, which can reduce engagement in physically heavy work in order to avoid pain (McCracken and Samuel, 2007). Accordingly, we hypothesize that depression and musculoskeletal pain have different effects on the ability to manage specific job demands. However, most studies report effects on overall work ability and not the effect on the ability to manage specific job demands (van den Berg et al., 2009).This shortage of knowledge partly stems from that the most widely used questionnaire for the assessment of work ability, the Work Ability Index (de Zwart et al., 2002; van den Berg et al., 2009), concerns physical and mental work ability in broad terms. It is, however, necessary to identify which job demands the employee is unable to meet, if tailored intervention is to be made, and therefore, knowledge about how health problems affect the ability to manage specific job demands is warranted.The Work-Limitation Questionnaire allows for an assessment of the respondent's difficulty managing a range of physical, psychological, and social demands (Lerner et al., 2001; Munir, 2008). Yet, it is the case for the Work Ability Index, the Work-Limitation Questionnaire, and also the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (Kessler et al., 2003) that the respondent is asked explicitly to assess the impact of his or her health on current work ability. This leaves the appraisal of the causal relationship between health and work ability to the responder and, furthermore, it results in a circular argument when statistically analyzing the association between health and reduced work ability. Consequently, neither the separate effect of poor health nor the interaction between poor health and high job demands on work ability can be investigated properly.To sum up, the present study intends to contribute to the literature on work ability by studying the associations of poor health with perceived difficulty managing specific job demands and by studying the interaction between poor health and working conditions in relation to perceived difficulty managing specific job demands. By means of a new questionnaire, ‘reduced demand-specific work ability’ was measured as difficulty managing seven different specific job demands without asking the respondent to appraise the influence of their health. Poor health was measured as musculoskeletal pain (MSP) and major depression (MD), and working conditions were measured as job demands and social support.More specifically, the aims of this cross-sectional study was first to describe the prevalence of reduced demand-specific work ability in a sample of 46-year and 56-year old full-time employees, second to study the association of reduced demand-specific work ability with age, gender, and vocational education; third to investigate the association of MSP and MD with reduced demand-specific work ability; and fourth to investigate the interaction between specific working conditions (job demands and social support) and poor health (MSP and MD) in relation to demand-specific work ability.
