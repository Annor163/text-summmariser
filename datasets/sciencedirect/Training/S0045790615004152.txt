PSS4: Four-Phase Shifted Sinusoid Symbol Signaling for High Speed I/O interconnects

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Instead of using amplitude modulation, a four-phase shifted sinusoid symbol signaling (PSS-4) is proposed for high-speed I/O interconnects from the phase aspect.PSS-4 reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty of 6.5 dB from PAM-4.A novel pre-emphasis technique is proposed for PSS-4 to improve the spectral performance.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Various signaling techniques have been considered for I/O interconnects at 25 Gb/s or higher. However, they either suffer from high baud rate, as in the case of NRZ, or an excess signal-to-noise ratio penalty, as in the case of PAM-4. To overcome these problems, a four-phase shifted sinusoid symbol (PSS-4) signaling method is proposed that can be readily applied to high-speed I/O transceivers. By using PSS-4, the SNR penalty can be reduced from PAM-4; our theoretical analysis has revealed that the SNR performance of the PSS-4 is 6.5 dB better than that of PAM-4 with comparable bandwidth. The transistor-level simulation results have shown that PSS-4 has an average of twice larger vertical eye opening than PAM-4. In addition, the supply voltage sensitivity of PSS-4 is 55% and 20% less than that of PAM-4 and NRZ, respectively, and the power consumption of PSS-4 is 13.5% lower than that of PAM-4.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
I/O interconnects of high-density multi-core system are facing substantial scaling problems to satisfy per-pin data rate requirements. As data rates reach 25 Gb/s or even higher [1–3], signal-integrity issues are severely aggravated by unexpected effects, such as attenuations, reflections, inter-symbol interference (ISI), and crosstalk. Transmitter feed-forward pre-emphasis and receiver equalization techniques [4] have been widely used in I/O transceivers to mitigate these issues. However, higher bandwidth requires I/O transceivers to incorporate a larger number of equalization taps into the equalizers, which can increase the circuit cost and power consumption dramatically.To relax the I/O design, a concept of transferring multiple bits per symbol by modulation techniques has been proposed to increase the I/O throughput. To facilitate the I/O interconnects in multi-core systems, various signaling methods have been employed, most noticeably four-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM-4) [5,6]. By transmitting two bits per symbol, PAM-4 suffers lower channel loss than non-return-to-zero (NRZ). However, for a given maximum voltage limit, the distance between each voltage level in PAM-4 is only one third of that of NRZ, resulting in a 9.5 dB of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) penalty [7]. This drawback can severely lead to a reduced eye opening (especially eye height) so that it can be difficult to make far-end decision even when enhanced equalization techniques are incorporated. Although raising supply voltage, to certain extent, can help alleviate this SNR problem, such practice would have adverse impacts on power consumption and design complexity, creating a much bigger integration problem in multi-core systems that often require a large number of I/O transceivers.In this paper, we thus attempt to address the aforementioned problems by developing a novel optimal signaling method for high-speed I/O interconnects. The major contributions of our work are summarized as follows:•We explore a four-phase shifted sinusoid symbol signaling method for I/O interconnects referred to as PSS-4, that can overcome the problems experienced by PAM-4 as well as other multi-level signaling. We will show that PSS-4 can reduce the symbol rate by half with only a 3.0 dB SNR penalty; this is much lower than for PAM-4. In addition, we propose a novel pre-emphasis technique to compress the bandwidth occupied by PSS-4, referred to as PSS-4-PE.We propose the de-cycling circuit to make the usage of clock signals as symbol patterns available. To mitigate the ISI, we propose a current-mode encoder with pre-emphasis to generate the PSS-4 symbols. On the receiver side, receiver equalization schemes and timing recovery circuit along with decoding schemes are proposed to recover the symbols.We extensively evaluate the proposed PSS-4 signaling method through transistor-level simulations and compare PSS-4 with NRZ and PAM-4 when applied to the I/O interconnects.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the related work on signaling method of I/O interconnects and Section 3 describes the proposed PSS-4 signaling method. The I/O transceiver architecture and circuits based on PSS-4 are detailed in Section 4. Section 5 presents the experimental results along with performance analysis. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
