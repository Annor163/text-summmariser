@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An ablation planning system plays a pivotal role in tumor ablation procedures, as it provides a dry run to guide the surgeons in a complicated anatomical environment. Over-ablation, over-perforation or under-ablation may result in complications during the treatments. An optimal solution is desired to have complete tumor coverage with minimal invasiveness, including minimal number of ablations and minimal number of perforation trajectories. As the planning of tumor ablation is a multi-objective problem, it is challenging to obtain optimal covering solutions based on clinician׳s experiences. Meanwhile, it is effective for computer-assisted systems to decide a set of optimal plans. This paper proposes a novel approach of integrating a computational optimization algorithm into the ablation planning system. The proposed ablation planning system is designed based on the following objectives: to achieve complete tumor coverage and to minimize the number of ablations, number of needle trajectories and over-ablation to the healthy tissue. These objectives are taken into account using a Genetic Algorithm, which is capable of generating feasible solutions within a constrained search space. The candidate ablation plans can be encoded in generations of chromosomes, which subsequently evolve based on a fitness function. In this paper, an exponential weight-criterion fitness function has been designed by incorporating constraint parameters that were reflective of the different objectives. According to the test results, the proposed planner is able to generate the set of optimal solutions for tumor ablation problem, thereby fulfilling the aforementioned multiple objectives.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Nowadays the trend of surgeries and interventions is shifting towards being minimally invasive and further being non-invasive. Such surgeries lessen the complications because more precise and sophisticated instruments are now employed to perform the surgeries [1–4]. The increase in performance accuracy and lesser invasiveness of these surgeries therefore extend its potential benefits to a wider population of patients, especially for the groups who are unable to undergo open surgeries [5–13]. Minimally invasive surgeries also result in a shorter surgical duration, which translate into lesser physical trauma and lower financial costs for the patients [14,15].As one type of minimally invasive interventional procedures, tumor ablation is the removal of tumor tissue using techniques like cryoablation [16,17], high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) [5,18], or radio-frequency (RFA) [5,6,8,10,19]. These techniques rely on minimally invasive principles to ablate tumor tissues, without having to directly expose the affected regions to the environment. Therefore, it has been widely noted that the success of a tumor ablation procedure hinges greatly on its pre-operative planning [5,6,14,18,20]. The proposed ablation planning system in this paper focuses mainly on the radio-frequency ablation (RFA) of hepatic tumors.Based on pre-operative medical scans, computer-assisted ablation planning systems are used to generate optimal surgical plans. Software modules like IGSTK [15], 3D Slicer [21] are currently used by surgeons and biomedical engineers to assist in the visualization of anatomical structures, registration and navigation of real-time images. By developing optimal treatment plans in these toolkits, it enables surgeons to visualize the 3-D tumor regions as well as the envisioned ablations. It makes feasible for surgeons to exploit and assess the treatments along operations. Heuristical Optimization is an effective approach to obtain acceptable solutions in multi-objective problems. In this paper, the tumor coverage, the number of ablations, the number of trajectories of needles are considered as objectives to optimize [22]. Genetic Algorithm, as a classic heuristic algorithm, is then employed in the optimization.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the paper reviews prior studies of ablation planning systems. In Sections 3 and 4, the paper proposes and highlights the relevance of using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in an ablation planning system, respectively. Section 5 describes how the tumor ablation is planned in GA. Section 6 describes the experiments performed on tumors. Section 7 concludes the paper.
