@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Image segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in image processing and computer vision. Among various image segmentation algorithms, level set based image segmentation algorithms have several advantages and various image segmentation algorithms based on level set have been proposed [1–4]. The image segmentation problem is represented as an energy minimization problem and the objective functional is solved by variational methods. The Euler–Lagrange equation of the objective functional can be obtained which guides the evolution of the level set function. The object contour is embedded as the zero level set of an implicit higher dimensional level set function and the evolution of the object contour is realized through the evolution of the level set function. The topology changes can be handled naturally by this method and the segmentation result is achieved when the object functional is minimized.The existing level set based image segmentation algorithms can roughly be divided into three categories: the edge based level set image segmentation algorithms [1–5], the region based level set image segmentation algorithms [6–11] and the hybrid level set image segmentation algorithms [12–14]. The most typical edge based method is geodesic active contour model [2]. The level set evolves according to an edge indicator function and stops at high contrast image gradients. There are obvious disadvantages of the edge based method such that it is very sensitive to the initial level set position and the level set can easily leak through weak edges. The region based method is thus proposed and the most typical region based method is the CV model [7]. It approximates the original image with two regions with constant grayscale so it is also called piecewise constant model. The region based method is not sensitive to the initial level set position and since the objective functional does not depend on image gradients, it can segment regions with weak edges. The evolution speed is also faster than edge based method. The hybrid method combines the two previous methods and the objective functional depends both on image gradients and region homogeneity.The basic assumption of CV model is that each segmented region has constant grayscale. The objective functional of CV model can be divided into two parts which contain a smoothness constraint term and a region term. The region term measures the integral of the squared difference between the mean value of the current segmented regions and the grayscale of the original image inside the current segmented regions. When this objective functional gets its minimum, the integral of the squared difference between the mean value and the grayscale of the two segmented regions is minimized. Actually, the integral of the squared difference between the mean value and the grayscale is the variance of that region. The variance of each region must get its minimum when the objective functional is minimized. This procedure is quite similar to the Otsu image thresholding algorithm. The Otsu image thresholding algorithm [15] is also known as maximum between-class variance thresholding algorithm or minimum within-class variance thresholding algorithm which means that a threshold is chosen such that the two segmented regions have maximum between-class variance or minimum within-class variance. From the above analysis, we can see that both methods aim to minimize the variance of the segmented regions and the only difference is the method of determination of the region. In CV model, the method of determination of the region is through a level set function and in Otsu thresholding algorithm, the determination is through a threshold. Through numerical experimentation, we also find that the segmentation results of the two methods are very similar. Since CV model also takes into consideration of the smoothness of the level set and Otsu method does not, their segmentation results are not exactly the same but are very similar. The segmentation results of CV model are always better than those obtained by Otsu method because of the smoothness constraint considered.In the image thresholding community, there is another widely used image thresholding algorithm which is called cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm [16]. The cross entropy measures an information theoretic distance between two probability distributions. The cross entropy image thresholding algorithm measures the probability distributions of the original image and segmented image. A threshold is chosen such that the distance is minimized. The cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm is similar to Otsu image threshold algorithm. In many cases, to minimize the distribution between the original image and the segmented image is more accurate than minimizing the variance of each segmented regions. The measurement of the distribution can be incorporated in the level set based framework. Inspired from the cross entropy, a new level set image segmentation algorithm is proposed where the region term is based on the measurement of the probability distribution. This new segmentation model can get similar results with cross entropy based image segmentation algorithm but better results can be obtained since the smoothness constraint is taken into consideration in the proposed level set based segmentation model. During the evolution of the level set function, the level set can deviate from the signed distance function and reinitialization is usually needed. To avoid reinitialize the level set function periodically, a distance regularized term [17,18] is added to the objective functional and level set function will tend to be a signed distance function during evolution. Another global minimization algorithm of the objective functional based on a dual formulation of the TV norm [19] is also proposed and the geodesic edge term can be incorporated naturally in the objective functional. Thus this formulation not only measures the probability distributions but also considers image gradient based energy. The implementation speed of the fast global minimization algorithm is very fast compared to the level set based method [20].The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces CV model and its relationship with Otsu image thresholding algorithm. Section 3 describes a new image segmentation algorithm and its relationship with cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm. The fast global minimization algorithm of the proposed method is introduced in Section 4. Some experiments applying the proposed method and some closely related level set based methods including CV model [7], minimization of region-scalable fitting energy level set model [8], bias field correction level set model [9], fast global minimization of the geodesic active contour model [20] and fast global minimization of the CV model [20] in segmenting remote sensing river images are presented in Section 5 followed by some concluding remarks in Section 6.Suppose a givenNx×Nyimage has L grayscale levels represented by [0,1,…,L−1]. The number of pixels whose grayscale intensity value equals i ishiand∑i=0L−1hi=Nx×Ny.hiis called the occurring frequency of grayscale i and{hi}i=0,…,L−1is the grayscale histogram of the given image. The probability of a pixel whose grayscale intensity value equals i ispiandpi=hiNx×Ny.{pi}i=0,…,L−1is the normalized grayscale histogram of the given image. Suppose that we segment the pixels into two classesC0andC1(background and objects, or vice versa) by a threshold at level tOtsu;C0denotes pixels with levels [0,…,tOtsu], andC1denotes pixels with levels [tOtsu+1,…,L−1]. Then the probabilities of class occurrence and the class mean values, respectively, are given by(1)ω0=∑i=0tOtsupi(2)ω1=∑i=tOtsu+1L−1piand(3)μ0=∑i=0tOtsuipi/ω0=∑i=0tOtsuipi/∑j=0tOtsupj(4)μ1=∑i=tOtsu+1L−1ipi/ω1=∑i=tOtsu+1L−1ipi/∑j=tOtsu+1L−1pjare the zeroth-order and the first-order cumulative moments of the normalized histogram up to thetOtsuth level, respectively.The class variances are given by(5)σ02=∑i=0tOtsu(i−μ0)2pi/ω0=∑i=0tOtsu(i−μ0)2pi/∑j=0tOtsupj(6)σ12=∑i=tOtsu+1L−1(i−μ1)2pi/ω1=∑i=tOtsu+1L−1(i−μ1)2pi/∑j=tOtsu+1L−1pjwhich are second-order cumulative moments.In order to evaluate the “goodness” of the threshold (at leveltOtsu), we shall introduce the following discriminant criterion measure (or measure of class separability)(7)σOtsu2(tOtsu)=ω0σ02+ω1σ12=∑i=0tOtsu(i−μ0)2pi+∑i=tOtsu+1L−1(i−μ1)2piwhich is the within-class variance. Then our problem is reduced to an optimization problem to search for a thresholdtOtsuthat minimizes the criterion measure [15]. This can be stated as follows(8)tOtsu⁎=argmintOtsu{σOtsu2(tOtsu)}the thresholdtOtsu⁎can be used to segment the given image into two regions.Let us define the evolving curve C in Ω, as the boundary of a closed subsetΩCof Ω (i.e.ΩC⊂ΩandC=∂ΩC). Ω is the image domain. Then the given image can be segmented into two regions which areΩCandΩ\ΩC. The objective functional of the piecewise constant active contour model is given as follows(9)EPC(ΩC,c1,c2,λ,μ)=μPer(ΩC)+λ[∫ΩC(f(x)−c1)2dx+∫Ω\ΩC(f(x)−c2)2dx]whereEPCis the energy of the piecewise constant active contour model, f is the given image,Per(ΩC)is the perimeter of the setΩC, λ and μ are two arbitrary positive parameters which control the tradeoff between the regularization process and the fidelity of the solution with respect to the original image f andc1,c2∈R. The variational model (9) determines the best approximation, in theL2sense of the image f as a set of (non-connected) regions with only two different values,c1andc2. IfΩCis fixed, the values ofc1andc2which minimize the energyEPCare the mean values inside and outsideΩC. The termPer(ΩC)imposes a smoothness constraint on the geometry of the setΩCwhich separates the piecewise constant regions.Per(ΩC)can be chosen to be the length of the evolving curve C. The objective is to find the regionΩCsuch that the objective functional is minimized(10)ΩC=argminΩC{EPC(ΩC,c1,c2,λ,μ)}andΩCcan be used to segment the given image into two regions.Chan and Vese proposed in [7] a solution to determine an evolution equation for the regionΩCbased on a level set based approach. They represent the regionsΩCandΩ\ΩCwith the Heaviside function of a level set function (which models a characteristic function). Hence the energyEPCcan be written according to a level set function ϕ(11)Eϕ;PC(ϕ,c1,c2,λ,μ)=μ∫Ω|∇Hε(ϕ)|dx+λ∫ΩHε(ϕ)(f(x)−c1)2+(1−Hε(ϕ))(f(x)−c2)2dxwhereHε(ϕ)is a regularization of the Heaviside function. The flow minimizing energy (11) is the following one(12)∂ϕ∂t=Hε′(ϕ)[μdiv(∇ϕ|∇ϕ|)−λ((f(x)−c1)2−(f(x)−c2)2)︸=r1(x,c1,c2)]Equation (12) can be solved by finite difference method iteratively and the final segmentation can be obtained as the steady state solution of the above equation.Comparing the objective functional (7) of Otsu image thresholding algorithm and the objective functional (9) of CV model, we can find that there are several similarities between them. First, both the objective functionals segment the given image into two regions. Specifically, in the Otsu image thresholding algorithm, a thresholdtOtsuis chosen and the image is segmented according to the relationship between the grayscale of the given image with the thresholdtOtsu(13)x∈{C0,f(x)≤tOtsuC1,f(x)>tOtsuWhile in CV model, a setΩCis defined and the pixels are segmented according to whether the pixel belongs to the setΩCor not(14)x∈{C0,x∈ΩCC1,x∈Ω\ΩCSecond, both the objective functionals aim to minimize a discriminant criterion which is the within-class variance. Specially, in Otsu method, the within-class variance is represented by the right hand side of equation (7) through normalized grayscale histogram while in CV model, the within-class variance is represented by the following region term through the setΩC(15)σPC2=∫ΩC(f(x)−c1)2dx+∫Ω\ΩC(f(x)−c2)2dxComparing the right hand side of equation (7) and equation (15), we can see that they are actually equivalent except that they are represented by different formulations. Though the above analysis, we can say that Otsu image thresholding method is nearly equivalent to CV model and both methods find a segmentation of the given image such that the within-class variance is minimized. We will further analyze their similarity in Section 5.Cross entropy measures the distance between two probability distributions. LetP={p1,p2,…,pn}andQ={q1,q2,…,qn}be two probability distributions, then the cross entropy,D(P,Q)is defined as follows(16)D(P,Q)=∑i=1npilog⁡piqiSuppose we choose a thresholdtcrossto segment the pixels into two classC0;crossandC1;crosswhereC0;crossdenotes pixels with grayscale levels [0,…,tcross] andC1;crossdenotes pixels with grayscale levels [tcross+1,…,L−1]. We can formulate the given image and the segmented image by two probability distributions which are(17)P1={f(x)∑i=0L−1hii}x∈Ω(18)P2={fs(x)∑i=0L−1hii}x∈ΩwhereP1andP2are the probability distributions of the given image and the segmented image respectively,fs(x)is the segmented image and can be represented as follows(19)fs(x)={μ0,f(x)≤tcrossμ1,f(x)>tcrosswhereμ0andμ1are the mean values ofC0;crossandC1;crosswhich can be calculated similarly as in equations (3) and (4). Using these two probability distributions, the cross entropy between the given image and the segmented image can be computed as follows(20)D(P1,P2)=∑f(x)≤tcrossf(x)∑i=0L−1hiilog⁡(f(x)/∑i=0L−1hiifs(x)/∑i=0L−1hii)+∑f(x)>tcrossf(x)∑i=0L−1hiilog⁡(f(x)/∑i=0L−1hiifs(x)/∑i=0L−1hii)=∑i=0tcrosshii∑i=0L−1hiilog⁡(iμ0)+∑i=tcross+1L−1hii∑i=0L−1hiilog⁡(iμ1)=1∑i=0L−1hii[∑i=0tcrosshiilog⁡(iμ0)+∑i=tcross+1L−1hiilog⁡(iμ1)]Using the above formula, a threshold selection criterion can be defined as follows(21)η(tcross)=[∑i=0tcrosshiilog⁡(iμ0)+∑i=tcross+1L−1hiilog⁡(iμ1)]The threshold is chosen such that the criterion is minimized which means the cross entropy of the given image and the segmented image is minimized(22)tcross⁎=argmintcross(η(tcross))The cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm is similar to the Otsu image segmentation method but they are different from their definition. The Otsu image thresholding method finds a threshold such that the within-class variance is minimized while the cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm finds a threshold such that the cross entropy between the given image and the segmented image is minimized. In many situations, the cross entropy based method can segment image more accurately.Inspired from the similarity between the Otsu image thresholding algorithm and CV model, we can define a new active contour image segmentation algorithm based on the definition of the cross entropy. The objective functional of the new active contour model is defined as follows(23)Ecross(ΩC,c1,c2,λ,μ)=μPer(ΩC)+λ[∫ΩCf(x)|log⁡(f(x)c1+δ)|dx+∫Ω\ΩCf(x)|log⁡(f(x)c2+δ)|dx]where the small constant δ is chosen to prevent the denominate to be 0 and in all the experiments in this paper, δ is chosen to be10−4. This is the active contour model based on cross entropy and we can see the difference between CV model and the similarity between the cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm. The region term in the CV model which computes the variance is replaced by a term which computes the cross entropy. This new active contour model aims to minimize the cross entropy between the given image and the segmented image just as CV model aims to minimize the within-class variance. Similar to [7], this objective functional can be represented by a level set formulation as follows(24)Eϕ;cross(ΩC,c1,c2,λ,μ)=μ∫Ω|∇Hε(ϕ)|dx+λ∫ΩHε(ϕ)f(x)|log⁡(f(x)c1+δ)|+(1−Hε(ϕ))f(x)|log⁡(f(x)c2+δ)|dxThe flow minimizing energy (24) is the following one(25)∂ϕ∂t=Hε′(ϕ)[μdiv(∇ϕ|∇ϕ|)−λ(f(x)|log⁡(f(x)c1+δ)|−f(x)|log⁡(f(x)c2+δ)|)︸=r2(x,c1,c2)]It can be solved iteratively and the steady state solution of the above equation can be used to segment the given image.The initial level set function is usually chosen as a signed distance function and during the evolution of the level set function, it can deviate from the signed distance function. To make the evolution of the level set function stable, reinitialization is usually needed. The level set function is reinitialized to the signed distance function periodically during the evolution process. To avoid the reinitialization process, a distance regularized term is added to the objective functional (24) and can be given as follows(26)Eϕ;crossr=Eϕ;cross+μ2∫Ωp(|∇ϕ|)dxwhere the potential function p is given as follows [18](27)p(s)={1(2π)2(1−cos⁡(2πs)),ifs≤112(s−1)2,ifs≥1This potentialp(s)has two minimum points ats=0ands=1and it can regularize the level set function through a forward and backward diffusion process. The regularization principle can be explained briefly as follows. The Gateaux derivative of the functionalRp(ϕ)=μ2∫Ωp(|∇ϕ|)dxis(28)∂Rp(ϕ)∂ϕ=−μ2div(dp(|∇ϕ|)∇ϕ)wherediv(⋅)is the divergence operator anddpis a function defined by(29)dp(s)=p′(s)sThe distance regularization effect can be seen from the gradient flow of the energy(30)∂ϕ∂t=μ2div(dp(|∇ϕ|)∇ϕ)The sign of the functiondp(s)indicates the property of the forward and backward diffusion in the following cases: for|∇ϕ|>1, the diffusion rateμ2dp(|∇ϕ|)is positive, and the diffusion (30) is forward, which decreases|∇ϕ|; for(1/2)<|∇ϕ|<1, the diffusion rateμ2dp(|∇ϕ|)is negative, and the diffusion (30) becomes backward, which increases|∇ϕ|, for|∇ϕ|<1/2, the diffusion rateμ2dp(|∇ϕ|)is positive, and the diffusion (30) is forward, which further decreases|∇ϕ|down to zero. After adding this distance regularized term, equation (25) changes to(31)∂ϕ∂t=Hε′(ϕ)[μdiv(∇ϕ|∇ϕ|)−λr2(x,c1,c2)]+μ2[div(sin⁡(2π|∇ϕ(x)|)2π|∇ϕ(x)|∇ϕ(x))H(1−|∇ϕ(x)|)+div(∇ϕ(x)−∇ϕ(x)|∇ϕ(x)|)H(|∇ϕ(x)|−1)]Using equation (31) to solve for the level set evolution, the level set will tend to be a signed distance function and it will not be reinitialized periodically thus reducing the computation time.In [20], the authors propose a fast global minimization algorithm of CV model based on a dual formulation of the TV-norm. The objective functional can be written as(32)Eglobal;PC(u,c1,c2,λ)=TVg(u)+λ∫Ωr1(x,c1,c2)udx(0≤u(x)≤L−1)whereTVg(u)=∫Ωg(x)|∇u|dxis the weighed TV-norm andg(x)=11+β|∇f(x)|2is an edge indicator function that vanishes at object boundaries and β is an arbitrary positive constant. In all the experiments in this paper, β is chosen to be 1. The condition0≤u(x)≤L−1must be obeyed and the above minimization problem is actually a constraint minimization problem. The weighed TV-norm equals the energy functional of the geodesic active contour (GAC) model when g is an edge indicator function and the function u is a characteristic function1ΩC, of a closed setΩC⊂Ω. Their equivalence can be shown as follows(33)TVg(u=1ΩC)=∫Ωg(x)|∇1ΩC|dx=∫Cg(s)ds=EGAC(C)Hence, minimizing energy (32) is equivalent tominimize∫Cgds=EGAC(C)(the GAC energy)while approximating f (in theL2sense) by two regionsΩCandΩ\ΩCwith two valuesc1andc2. The authors then convert the constraint minimization problem (32) to a convex and unconstrained minimization problem and use an alternate minimization method to get the global minimization solution. Since the proposed energy functional (23) is similar to CV model, a fast global minimization algorithm based on a dual formulation of the TV-norm can be also given for the proposed energy functional. The global minimization objective functional can be given as follows(34)Eglobal;cross(u,c1,c2,λ)=TVg(u)+λ∫Ωr2(x,c1,c2)udx(0≤u(x)≤L−1)The only difference between equation (34) and equation (32) is thatr1(x,c1,c2)is replaced byr2(x,c1,c2). Hence, minimizing energy (34) is equivalent tominimize∫Cgds=EGAC(C)(the GAC energy)while approximating f (in the probability distribution sense) by two regionsΩCandΩ\ΩCwith the probability distributionP2={fs(x)∑i=0L−1hii}x∈Ω, wherefs(x)equalsc1whenx∈ΩCandfs(x)equalsc2whenx∈Ω\ΩC.Following the steps in [20], the constraint minimization problem is converted to the following unconstraint minimization problem(35)minu⁡{TVg(u)+∫Ωλr2(x,c1,c2)u+αυ(u)dx}whereυ(ξ)=max⁡{0,2|ξ−1/2|−1}and the constant α must be chosen large enough compared to λ such asα>λ2‖r2(x)‖L∞(Ω).The variational problem (35) is regularized as a minimization problem containing two variables as follows(36)minu,v⁡{Eglobal;crossr(u,v,c1,c2,λ,α,θ)=TVg(u)+12θ‖u−v‖L22+∫Ωλr2(x,c1,c2)v+αυ(v)dx}where the parameterθ>0is chosen to be small. Since functionalEglobal;crossris convex, its minimizer can be computed by minimizingEglobal;crossrwith respect to u and v separately, and to iterate until convergence. Thus the following minimization problems are considered(1)v being fixed, we search for u as a solution of(37)minu⁡{TVg(u)+12θ‖u−v‖L22}u being fixed, we search for v as a solution of(38)minv⁡{12θ‖u−v‖L22+∫Ωλr2(x,c1,c2)v+αυ(v)dx}The iteration scheme (39) is straightforward to implement. The discrete divergence operator div is given by [21](divp)ix,iy={pix,iy1−pix−1,iy1if1<ix<Nxpix,iy1ifix=1−pix−1,iy1ifix=Nx+{pix,iy2−pix,iy−12if1<iy<Nxpix,iy1ifiy=1−pix,iy−11ifiy=Nyand the discrete gradient operator is as follows [21](∇u)ix,iy=((∇u)ix,iy1,(∇u)ix,iy2)with(∇u)ix,iy1={uix+1,iy−uix,iyifix<Nx0ifix=Nx(∇u)ix,iy1={uix,iy+1−uix,iyifiy<Ny0ifiy=NyThus (39) and (40) are iterated in order to minimize energy (38). Of course, the constantsc1andc2are updated every iterations. In all experiments, initial values areu0=v0=L/2⋅1Nx×Ny,p0;1=p0;2=0, where1Nx×Nyrepresents a matrix whose elements are all 1, the temporal step is equal toδt=1/8and the stopping criteria ismax⁡(|un+1−un|,|vn+1−vn|)≤ε⁎. The fast global minimization of the proposed method not only considers the cross entropy between the given image and the segmented image, but also considers the geodesic edge term. Besides, the implementation speed of the fast global minimization method is always faster compared to the level set based implementation method.In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a large number of experiments have been done. Two versions of the proposed method have been applied which are the level set implementation method (denoted by LS implementation for short) and the fast global minimization implementation method (denoted by FG implementation for short). The proposed method is applied to segment several remote sensing river images and the proposed method is compared to CV model [7], minimization of region-scalable fitting (RSF) energy level set model [8] (denoted by RSF energy model for short), bias field correction level set model [9] (denoted by BFC model for short), fast global minimization of geodesic active contour model [20] (denoted by global GAC model for short) and fast global minimization of CV model [20] (denoted by global CV model for short). We also give the segmented images obtained by Otsu image thresholding algorithm and cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm as reference images. The experimental setting is Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU D2700 2.13 GHz/ 2.00 GB RAM/ MATLAB 7.6.0. We use 6 remote sensing river images to demonstrate the experimental results. The size of the 6 images are173×166,145×147,135×205,214×216,215×216,214×215respectively. The parameters used in the proposed method are follows: in the level set implementation,μ=10−4⋅2552,λ=10,μ2=0.05, in the fast global implementation,θ=0.5,λ=0.2. The parameters for other methods are respectively set to their best. The image segmentation results are given in Figs. 1–6. The original images are shown in (a), the segmentation results of CV model are shown in (b), the segmentation results of RSF model are shown in (c), the segmentation results of BFC model are shown in (d), the segmentation results of global GAC model are shown in (e), the segmentation results of global CV model are shown in (f), the segmentation results of LS implementation of the proposed method are shown in (g), the segmentation results of FG implementation of the proposed method are shown in (h), the Otsu image segmentation results and the cross entropy based image segmentation results are shown in (i) and (j) respectively.The characteristic of the remote sensing river images can be described as follows after observing the original river images presented in Figs. 1–6 (a). First, the pixel intensities of the river region are very low compared to the background. Second, the area inside river region presents intensity homogeneity while the area inside background presents intensity inhomogeneity. Third, there are many non-river targets presented inside the background and they have similar intensity values and intensity homogeneity properties as river region. These non-river targets are hard to identify when only pixel intensities are considered in the segmentation algorithm.From the experimental results we can find the following important facts. First, comparing Figs. 1–6 (b) and Figs. 1–6 (i), we can see that they are quite similar to each other. Figs. 1–6 (b) are the segmentation results of CV model and Figs. 1–6 (i) are the segmentation results of Otsu image thresholding algorithm. This fact verifies the analysis presented in Section 2.2 where we point out that both methods aim to find a segmentation of the given image whose within-class variance is minimized. Second, comparing Figs. 1–6 (g) and Figs. 1–6 (j), we also find that they are similar to each other. Figs. 1–6 (g) are the segmentation results from the level set implementation of the proposed method and Figs. 1–6 (j) are the segmentation results of cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm. Since we formulate the objective functional based on the cross entropy, both methods aim to find a segmentation of the given image where the cross entropy is minimized. This similarity also verifies the correctness of the proposed objective functional. Third, comparing Figs. 1–6 (i) and Figs. 1–6 (j), we can see that the results obtained by cross entropy are always better than the results from Otsu method. More background pixels and non-river targets are incorrectly classified as the river region in the Otsu method. The criterion which is to minimize the within-class variance cannot identify whether the pixel belongs to background or river but the criterion which measures the cross entropy somewhat can. Correspondingly, comparing Figs. 1–6 (b) and Figs. 1–6 (g), the method proposed can get better results than CV model.We further analyze the segmentation results obtained from other methods. Through observing Figs. 1–6 (c), we find that the segmented images cannot correctly reflect the river region and the background. Figs. 1–6 (c) are the segmentation results obtained from RSF energy model. This model is initially proposed to overcome the intensity inhomogeneity presented in each region. This model can easily be trapped in local minima during the evolution process and the segmentation results are incorrect. The BFC model is very similar to the RSF energy model and this model also has the problem of local minima. The segmentation results of BFC model are shown in Figs. 1–6 (d) and we find that the segmentation results are similar to the results obtained by RSF energy model. Next we compare the results obtained from fast global minimization methods. Figs. 1–6 (f) are results obtained from fast global minimization of CV model. From these figures we can see that the segmentation results are more accurate than original CV model. The geodesic energy term is considered in this fast implementation version and the active contour will tend to stop at positions with high image gradients. However, this method has some drawbacks. First, there are two parameters θ and λ in this method. The choice of the parameters will affect the final segmentation results in a great extent and the choices of the parameters are most heuristic during the implementation. Second, the iteration number is not easily determined since the solution generally does not convert to a fixed point. The iteration number must be chosen manually. Third, from the segmentation results we can find that the river region is not complete which means some parts of the river region are segmented as background. The fast implementation of the proposed method has similar drawbacks but the solution generally converges and the parameters are more easily chosen than fast global minimization of CV model. The segmentation results are correct as we can see from Figs. 1–6 (h). The results shown in Figs. 1–6 (e) are fast global implementation of GAC model. The segmentation results are also good but are not as accurate as the method proposed.In order to compare more explicitly the Otsu image thresholding algorithm and cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm when applied to this set of test images, we list the thresholds in Table 1. From Table 1 we can see that the thresholds obtained by cross entropy based method are always lower than Otsu method. In fact, when segmenting this set of test images, choosing a lower threshold is better than choosing a higher threshold since the pixel intensity of the river region is generally very low compared to the background region. The small non-river targets belonging to the background will not be segmented to the river region when the threshold is chosen relatively low. Table 2lists the iteration number of the 7 methods. The iteration number of global GAC model, global CV model and FG implementation of the proposed method is set manually. The iteration number of LS implementation of the proposed method is generally larger compared to CV model, RSF energy model and BFC model. The iteration number of RSF energy model and BFC model is small since these two models will be easily trapped in local minima and then the evolution process will stop before the final global minima is reached. CV model is generally faster than the LS implementation but is not accurate. The number of iteration of FG implementation is comparable to the global CV model. Global GAC model generally needs more iteration number. The running time of each image segmentation method is listed in Table 3. From Table 3 we can see the following four points. First, the running time of each image segmentation method is dependent on the size of the image. When the size of image grows, the running time also grows. The size of Figs. 4–6 is larger than that of Figs. 1–3 and we can see from the table that the running time of Figs. 4–6 is also longer than that of Figs. 1–3. Second, the running time of the proposed method is longer than that of CV model. The reason is that the computation involved in the proposed method is more complex. Third, the running time of the fast implementation is far less than that of the level set implementation. Forth, the running time of RSF energy model and BFC model is very long compared to that of CV model and the proposed method since there is convolution operation in computing the results of those methods.Finally, we make some comparisons between the two methods proposed in this paper which are the LS implementation method and the FG implementation method. The main drawback of the LS implementation method is that the level set can be trapped in local minima and the final segmentation result is not correct. This phenomenon can be observed from Figs. 2–3 (g). The segmentation results are wrong since the level set stops at local minima. In contrast, the FG implementation method will always get the right segmentation result. The only drawback of the FG implementation method is that the parameters and the iteration number have to be set manually and this process is heuristic.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper a new active contour segmentation method based on cross entropy is proposed. Based on the fact that CV model and Otsu image thresholding method both find a segmentation of a given image whose within-class variance is minimized, the new active contour segmentation method aims to find a segmentation of a given image where the cross entropy of the original image and the segmented image is minimized just as cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm. Two implementation methods are proposed which are the level set implementation and the fast global minimization implementation and these two methods both have some advantages and disadvantages. The similarity between CV model and Otsu image thresholding algorithm and the similarity between the proposed method and cross entropy based image thresholding algorithm is demonstrated in the experiments. The proposed method is compared to several closely related methods including CV model, RSF energy model, BFC model, global GAC model and global CV model. Experimental results show that the proposed method can get better segmentation results compared to these methods and the number of miss classified pixels is the least when applying the proposed method.There are some future research directions we want to point out. First, the equivalence of CV model and Otsu image thresholding algorithm may be proved mathematically from their definition. Second, other image thresholding algorithms may be incorporated in the level set based framework and fast global minimization of the objective functional may be used. Third, inspired from the similarity between level set based framework and image thresholding based framework, the objective functional of image thresholding may be modified such as adding a geodesic edge term which considers image gradients.
