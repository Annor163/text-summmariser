Background and objectiveTransfer function (TF) is an important parameter for the analysis and understanding of hemodynamics when arterial stenosis exists in human arterial tree. Aimed to validate the feasibility of using TF to diagnose arterial stenosis, the forward problem and inverse problem were simulated and discussed.MethodsA calculation method of TF between ascending aorta and any other artery was proposed based on a 55 segment transmission line model (TLM) of human artery tree. The effects of artery stenosis on TF were studied in two aspects: stenosis degree and position. The degree of arterial stenosis was specified to be 10–90% in three representative arteries: carotid, aorta and iliac artery, respectively. In order to validate the feasibility of diagnosis of artery stenosis using TF and support vector machine (SVM), a database of TF was established to simulate the real conditions of artery stenosis based on the TLM model. And a diagnosis model of artery stenosis was built by using SVM and the database.ResultsThe simulating results showed the modulus and phase of TF were decreasing sharply from frequency 2 to 10Hz with the stenosis degree increasing and displayed their unique and nonlinear characteristics when frequency is higher than 10Hz. The diagnosis results showed the average accuracy was above 76% for the stenosis from 10% to 90% degree, and the diagnosis accuracies of moderate (50%) and serious (90%) stenosis were 87% and 99%, respectively. When the stenosis degree increased to 90%, the accuracy of stenosis localization reached up to 94% for most of arteries.ConclusionsThe proposed method of combining TF and SVM is a theoretically feasible method for diagnosis of artery stenosis.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Artery stenosis is one kind of arterial disease in human cardiovascular system caused by the lesion of artery wall or congenital dysplasia disease, which usually occurs in the large and middle-sized arteries, such as carotid, cerebral, coronary and renal arteries [1,2]. This disease directly affects the normal operation of relevant organs, causes organ insufficiency or degradation, and results in serious consequences: stroke, myocardial infarction, renal function loss, etc [3,4]. Therefore, the early detection of arterial stenosis is very important for reducing the high morbidity and mortality caused by the kind disease.The diagnosis technologies of artery stenosis mainly include digital subtraction angiography (DSA), transcranial Doppler (TD), computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), etc [5–7]. Although these powerful technologies have advanced greatly, disadvantages still exist for each procedure. For example, DSA is an invasive method, though it is considered to be a gold standard; TD has low accuracy for the detection of stenosis of small arteries; CTA exposes patients to X-ray radiation and cannot completely prevent allergy to iodinated contrast agents; MRA is expensive. Moreover, pieces of equipment used in these technologies are mainly applied in hospitals and are not suitable for large area screenings. Therefore, a non-invasive, portable and simple technology has to be developed as a valuable complement to current methods, which is urgently needed for the large area screening of early artery stenosis [8–10].The pulse-wave-based analysis method is a potential portable and noninvasive diagnosis technology of artery stenosis. Some useful parameters have been proposed based on this method, such as ankle brachial index (ABI) [11], pulse wave velocity (PWV) [12], transfer function (TF) [13], input impedance [14]. ABI is only used to detect the arterial stenosis of lower extremity, but not to detect the arterial stenosis of upper extremity, chest, abdomen, etc. Input impedance has been demonstrated numerically to be a valuable and useful parameter for the prediction of the artery stenosis in the human artery tree [15]. However, it is difficult to measure or calculate the input impedance of human arterial tree in clinic trials [14,16]. The measurement or calculation of TF is easier than input impedance and also represents the mechanical and geometrical features of human arterial tree like input impedance. Because it is not affected by the blood pressure and flow waveform, TF has been successfully applied to noninvasively measure central blood pressure by using blood pressure waveform of radial or brachial artery, and achieved some good clinical results [17,18].Some researches have demonstrated there is a relation between TF and stenosis to some extent. Rajani [19] validated the central blood pressure and TF changed when some stenosis exist in human arterial tree. Gong [20] and Reinhard [21] evaluated the validity of the transfer function analysis in the assessment of human cerebral autoregulation in patients with carotid or basilar artery stenosis. Chao [22] conducted a study on comparisons of the baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability in patients with carotid stenosis and normal controls by using the method of TF analysis. Although a few valuable results and conclusions were obtained, the mathematical relation or model between TF and stenosis has not been established. In order to discover the potential of pulse-wave-based method for stenosis diagnosis, it is worthwhile to study the relation or modeling between of them.In this paper, two aspects were mainly discussed: (1) A calculating method of TF was firstly proposed based on our previously presented transmission line model of 55 segment human arterial tree [23]. Then, one discussed the effects of arterial stenosis degree and position on the TF between ascending artery and carotid artery, radial artery and tibial artery. (2) Support vector machine (SVM) [24–27], a machine learning method based on statistics, was introduced into the diagnosis of artery stenosis with TF as the feature vector of SVM model, and was validated by numerical simulation experiments. In the experiments, firstly, we built a database of samples using the transmission line model of human artery tree. Secondly, TF for each sample was calculated by a serial multiplication algorithm. Finally, two prediction models, one for stenosis existence, other for stenosis localization, were built by SVM and TF, and used to predict artery stenosis. The effects of the degree and position of artery stenosis on the prediction accuracy were discussed.
