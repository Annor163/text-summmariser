@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Model risk has a huge impact on any risk measurement procedure and its quantification is therefore a crucial step. In this paper, we introduce three quantitative measures of model risk when choosing a particular reference model within a given class: the absolute measure of model risk, the relative measure of model risk and the local measure of model risk. Each of the measures has a specific purpose and so allows for flexibility. We illustrate the various notions by studying some relevant examples, so as to emphasize the practicability and tractability of our approach.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The specification of a model is a crucial step when measuring financial risks to which a portfolio, or even an institution, is exposed. Common methodologies, such as Delta-Normal or simulation methods, are based on the choice of a particular model for the risk factors, including for instance, equity, interest-rate or credit risk. Even when using historical methods, we implicitly rely on the empirical distribution as the reference model. However, it is observed that the final risk figure is often quite sensitive to the choice of the model. The hazard of working with a potentially not well-suited model is referred to as model risk. The study of the impact of model risk and its quantification is an important step in the whole risk measurement procedure. In particular, in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, understanding model uncertainty when assessing the regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions seems to be crucial. The main goal of this paper is precisely to propose some ways to quantify model risk when measuring financial risks for regulatory purposes. We stress that our objective is not to measure risk in the presence of model uncertainty, but to quantify model risk itself.The question of the impact of model risk has received increasing attention in recent years. In particular, the significance of minimum risk portfolios has been questioned when studying the problem of optimal asset allocation: several authors (among them El Ghaoui et al., 2003; Fertis et al., 2012; Zymler et al., 2013) have recently considered this issue from a robust optimization perspective.Our approach to assessing model risk is very general. It is based on the specification of a set of alternative models (or distributions) around a reference one. Note that Kerkhof et al. (2010) propose measuring model risk in a similar setting by computing the worst-case risk measure over a tolerance set of models. Our approach differs, however, as we introduce different measures of model risk, based on both the worst- and best-case risk measures, in order to serve different purposes.Examples of the set of alternative models we can consider include parametric or non-parametric families of distributions, or small perturbations of a given distribution. If we believe in a parametric model, we can consider all distributions within the family whose parameters are in the confidence intervals derived from the data. By doing this, we are accounting only for the estimation risk (see Kerkhof et al., 2010). If, on the other hand, we completely believe in some estimated quantities, without relying on confidence intervals, we can consider all possible distributions of any form which are in accordance with those quantities. We can also consider those distributions which are not too far from a reference one, according to some statistical distance (the uniform distance, for instance), or all joint distributions that have the same marginals as the reference one. This latter example leads to the relevant problem of aggregation of risks in a portfolio (see Embrechts et al., 2013). We could even specify different pricing models if the portfolio contains derivatives.Note that the scope of our approach is very wide, going beyond issues pertaining just to statistical estimation. Furthermore, the assessment of model risk should not be confused with the analysis of statistical robustness of a risk measurement procedure (as in Cont et al., 2010), even though the two concepts are related. Indeed, the reference distribution is an input in our approach, while in Cont et al. (2010) it is the result of a statistical estimation process which is part of the definition of robustness itself.In order to assess model risk, we introduce three different measures: the absolute measure of model risk, the relative measure of model risk and the local measure of model risk. Our aim is to provide a quantitative measure of the model risk we are exposed to in choosing a particular reference model within a given class when working with a specific risk measure. All three measures are pure numbers, independent from the reference currency. They take non-negative values and vanish precisely when there is no model risk. Each of the measures we propose has a specific purpose and therefore can be used in different contexts: whilst the absolute measure is cardinal and gives a quantitative assessment of model risk, both the relative measure and the local measure are ordinal and allow for comparison of different situations, which may have different scales. If we consider different possible models as references, the use of the relative measure is probably the more natural measure to use as it will give a clear ranking between the alternatives. When the reference model is almost certain, the local measure becomes an obvious choice as it focuses on the very local properties around the reference model.The measures of model risk we propose can be applied in different contexts. To briefly illustrate this flexibility, we mention here two examples: first, GARCH Value-at-Risk (VaR) procedures and then, computation of Additional Valuation Adjustments (AVA).Firstly, within the standard GARCH approach for market VaR estimation, the meanμ^and standard deviationσ^(or volatility) of the returns are estimated using a GARCH model; moreover, the innovations, i.e. the returns standardized by the estimated means and volatilities, are assumed to be normally distributed. Therefore, the VaR is computed under the assumption that returns are normally distributed with parametersμ^andσ^. The model risk that arises from the normality assumption can be quantified using one of the measures presented in this paper. As alternative models, we may consider all distributions (not necessarily normal) with meanμ^and standard deviationσ^.Secondly, let us consider the recent Capital Requirements Directives (CRD) for the financial services industry, enforced since 2013 in the EU. Under the CRD, financial institutions are required to calculate AVA in all situations in which the market value of an asset is not clear. This should reflect the model risk involved in the valuation of the position. In particular, the last draft of the Regulatory Technical Standard11Available at www.eba.europa.eu.issued by the European Banking Association proposes that: “institutions shall calculate the model risk AVA by determining a range of plausible valuations produced from alternative appropriate modelling and calibration approaches.” (Article 11). So, by formally replacing risk measures with valuations in our framework, the measures of model risk we propose could be effectively used for this purpose.The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, as a motivating example, we show how the Basel multiplier can be seen as a rough measure of model risk. In Section 3 we present the definition and the main properties of absolute and relative measures of model risk. Some examples, using alternative sets of distributions based on fixed moments or small perturbations, are provided in Section 4. In Section 5 we discuss local measures of model risk and Section 6 concludes.In this section, we start by looking at the Basel multiplier, introduced by the Basel Committee as an ingredient in the assessment of the capital requirements for financial institutions. As we will see, this multiplier is closely related to probabilistic bounds giving some upper limit to classical risk measures such as the Value-at-Risk and the Expected Shortfall. These preliminary remarks will motivate our approach when introducing some measures for model risk in the next section.Within the Basel framework, financial institutions are allowed to use internal models to assess the capital requirement due to market risk. The capital charge is actually the sum of six terms taking into account different facets of market risk. The term that measures risk in usual conditions is given by the following formula:(1)CC=max{VaR(0),λ60∑i=160VaR(−i)},where VaR(0) is the portfolio’s Value-at-Risk (of order 1 percent and with a 10-day horizon) computed today, while VaR( − i) is the figure we obtained i days ago.The constant λ is called the multiplier and it is assigned to each institution by the regulator, which periodically revises it. Its minimum value is 3, but it can be increased up to 4 in the event that the risk measurement system provides poor back-testing performances. Given the magnitude of λ, it is apparent that in normal conditions the second term is the leading one in the maximum appearing in (1).Stahl (1997) offered a simple theoretical justification for the multiplier to be chosen in the range [3, 4]. Here, we briefly summarize his argument. Let X be the random variable (r.v.) describing the Profits-and-Losses of a portfolio due to market risk. If the time-horizon is short, it is usually assumed thatE[X]=0,so thatVaRα(X)=σVaRα(X˜),where σ2 is the variance of X andX˜=X/σis standard, i.e. it has zero mean and unit variance. While σ is a matter of estimation,VaRα(X˜)depends on the assumption we make about the type of the distribution of X (normal, Student-t, etc.).An application of the Chebishev inequality toX˜yields(2)P(X˜⩽−q)⩽P(|X˜|⩾q)⩽1q2,q>0.Recalling the definition of VaR, it readily followsVaRα(X˜)⩽1/α,or(3)VaRα(X)⩽σα.The right hand side of the above inequality thus provides an upper bound for the VaR of a random variable having mean 0 and variance σ2. It can be compared with the VaR we obtain by using the delta-normal method, which is very commonly employed in practice. According to this method,X˜is normally distributed and thereforeVaRα(X)=σ|zα|(α<0.5),where zα= Φ−1(α) is the quantile of a standard normal. The graph of the ratio(4)σ/ασ|zα|=1|zα|αis reported below (see Fig. 1, a). We can see that for usual values of α (i.e. from 1 percent to 5 percent), the ratio broadly lies in the interval [3, 4]. Therefore, if the VaR computed under normal assumptions is multiplied by λ, we obtain an upper bound for the worst possible VaR compatible with partial information (mean and variance) we have.We can then extend this argument to the Expected Shortfall.22Also see Leippold and Vanini (2002).Indeed, by integrating inequality (3), we obtain(5)ESα(X)=1α∫0αVaRu(X)du⩽σα∫0αduu=2σα.The upper bound has to be compared with the Expected Shortfall under normal assumptions, which isES(X)=σφ(zα)α,where φ is the density of a standard normal. From the graph of the ratio2σ/ασφ(zα)/α=2αφ(zα)(see Fig. 1, b) we see that a proper multiplier for the Expected Shortfall would be in the range [4, 8].The second inequality in (2) is sharp, i.e. it cannot be improved for any q. However, the first inequality is certainly not sharp and this means that the upper bounds for VaR and Expected Shortfall that we derived above are not optimal ones.Better results for the bounds can be achieved by using the Cantelli inequality which concentrates on a single tail. A possible version of this inequality states that for a standard r.v.X˜,the following inequality holds true:(6)P(X˜⩽−q)⩽11+q2,q>0.From (6) it readily follows that(7)VaRα(X)⩽σ1−ααfor any random variable having mean 0 and variance σ2. We see that this latter bound improves on (3). Nevertheless, the ratio between this bound and the VaR computed under normal assumptions broadly remains between 3 and 4.Integrating (7) we obtain the following upper bound for the Expected Shortfall:(8)ESα(X)⩽σα∫0α1−uudu=σα(α−α2+arctan1−αα).This bound slightly improves on (5).It is well known that the Cantelli inequality provides a sharp upper bound on the tail probability.33See for instance Billingsley (1995),Section 5.To put it another way, the following holds true:supX˜standardP(X˜⩽−q)=11+q2,q>0.This means that(1−α)/αis a sharp upper bound onVaRα(X˜)forX˜standard (see also Lemma 4.2 below). By contrast, the bound (8), being an integral of sharp bounds, is not necessarily sharp. Indeed, we will recall later that the sharp bound is, in this case,ESα(X)⩽(1−α)/α.We can plot the ratio between the sharp upper bound and the risk measure computed under Gaussian hypotheses and compare it with the ratio we obtained before, using the Chebishev bounds. The results are in Fig. 2. We can notice that for the Expected Shortfall, the actual ratio (i.e. the one based on the sharp bound) is much lower than the ratio based on the Chebishev bound and the actual multiplier should be in the range [3, 4] for the Expected Shortfall as well. This also means that assessing the impact of model uncertainty using Chebishev bounds can give us misleading answers regarding the Expected Shortfall.Therefore, it becomes apparent that an accurate analysis and understanding of the sharp bounds for the considered risk measure is essential in the assessment of model risk. Any other bounds may lead to an inaccurate assessment of the model risk and as a consequence to potential errors in any associated decision process. For that reason, in this paper we introduce different measures of model risk based on sharp bounds (both lower and upper bounds). The explicit computation of those bounds will then be a crucial step.In this section, we introduce two different notions of measures of model risk. We will work with a given risk measure, a given reference model and a set of alternative models. Our aim is to provide a quantitative measure of the model risk we are exposed to in choosing this particular reference model within a given class when working with a specific risk measure. Two measures are introduced: the absolute measure of model risk provides a cardinal measure whilst the relative measure of model risk is ordinal and allows for comparison between various situations.We first introduce some basic notation and assumptions to be used here and in the sequel to this paper. A probability space(Ω,F,P)is given and we assume it to be atomless.44This ensures, for any distribution F, the existence of a r.v. distributed as F.For any r.v. X defined on(Ω,F,P),let FXbe the associated distribution function, i.e. FX(x) = P(X ≤ x), andqα(X)=inf{x:FX(x)⩾α}be the (lower) quantile of order α ∈ (0, 1). We will write X ∼ Y if FX≡ FYand X ∼ F if FX≡ F. In this paper, a risk measure is a mapρ:Lρ→R,defined on some space of r.v.Lρand satisfying the following properties•law invariance: ρ(X) = ρ(Y) whenever X ∼ Ypositive homogeneity: ρ(aX) = aρ(X) for any a ≥ 0translation invariance: ρ(X + b) = ρ(X) − b for anyb∈RWe remark that, for fixed α ∈ (0, 1), both the Value-at-RiskVaRα(X)=−qα(X),and the Expected ShortfallESα(X)=1α∫0αVaRu(X)dusatisfy these assumptions. We stress that Value-at-Risk is defined over all random variables, while the Expected Shortfall requires an integrability condition on the left tail of X. More generally any law-invariant coherent risk measure falls in our framework, a chief example being the class of spectral risk measures (see Acerbi, 2002). In view of the law invariance property, we can alternatively regard a risk measure as a functional directly defined on a suitable set of distributions. Indeed, with a slight abuse of notation, we can set ρ(F) = ρ(X) for X ∼ F.We now introduce two measures of model risk. Both measures are associated to a risk measure ρ, a r.v. X0, to act as a reference distribution hypothesis, and a setLof r.v., to act as alternative distribution hypotheses. In this paper, we do not discuss the selection procedure for the reference distribution, and refer to Alexander and Sarabia (2012), where some specific criteria are reviewed. We assume thatX0∈L⊂Lρ. We also assume that both quantitiesρ̲(L)=infX∈Lρ(X),ρ¯(L)=supX∈Lρ(X)are finite and thatρ̲(L)≠ρ¯(L). Clearly, the inequalitiesρ̲(L)⩽ρ(X0)⩽ρ¯(L)hold true. Finally, we assume that ρ(X0) > 0: this is not a restrictive hypothesis as the measured risk of financial positions is usually positive. We are ready to give the two definitions of model risk.Definition 3.1The absolute measure of model risk associated to ρ, X0 andLis55For the sake of simplicity, we drop the obvious dependence on ρ.AM=AM(X0,L)=ρ¯(L)ρ(X0)−1.The relative measure of model risk isRM=RM(X0,L)=ρ¯(L)−ρ(X0)ρ¯(L)−ρ̲(L).The absolute measure is a concept which in a sense generalizes the Basel multiplier: indeed, by multiplying ρ(X0) by AM + 1 we reach the maximum risk that is attainable withinL. So, if we interpretLas a set of possible departures from the reference model X0, then AM quantifies how bad the worst possible case is. Plainly, AM ≥ 0 with AM = 0 (i.e. no model risk) if and only if X0 has already a worst-case distribution, i.e.ρ(X0)=ρ¯(L).It is apparent that, for given ρ and X0, the largerLis the greater AM is, asρ¯(L)is increasing inL. This justifies the qualifier absolute that we give to AM, even though it comes in the form of a ratio.By contrast, RM has a relative behaviour. Indeed, the differenceρ¯(L)−ρ(X0)is divided by the whole rangeρ¯(L)−ρ̲(L). As a consequence, it is immediately seen that0⩽RM⩽1.We observe RM = 0 or 1 precisely whenρ(X0)=ρ¯(L)(no model risk) orρ(X0)=ρ̲(L)(full model risk). In other words, it focuses on the relative positionof ρ(X0) within the range[ρ̲(L),ρ¯(L)]and not only on the position with respect to the supremum. In the next section, we will also see that RM need not be increasing inL,thus providing a relative assessment of model risk.Remark 3.2Using the previous notation, the measure of model risk introduced in Kerkhof et al. (2010) isMK=ρ¯(L)−ρ(X0).We note that this measure is also non-negative and vanishes precisely when there is no model risk. However, it is expressed in terms of a given currency and depends on the scale of the risk X0. Since AM = MK/ρ(X0), the absolute measure proposed here is a unit-less version of MK, normalized by the size of the risk. We think that this normalization allows us to use AM also as a comparison tool between different situations.In the different context of derivative pricing, Cont (2006) proposed a measure of model risk which is based on the computation of extremal prices using a set of pricing measures. The obtained measure is formally similar to our definitions.In the next proposition, we collect some basic properties of the two measures of model risk previously introduced. For anya,b∈Rwe defineaL+b={aX+b:X∈L}Proposition 3.4For any a > 0 andb∈Rit holdsAM(aX0,aL)=AM(X0,L),AM(X0+b,L+b){>AM(X0,L),forb>0<AM(X0,L),forb<0andRM(aX0+b,aL+b)=RM(X0,L).The proof is trivial once we observe that for a > 0 andb∈Rρ̲(aL+b)=aρ̲(L)−b,ρ¯(aL+b)=aρ¯(L)−band ρ(aX0 + b) = aρ(X0) − b.□For givenμ∈Rand σ > 0, consider the setLμ,σ={X:E[X]=μ,σ(X)=σ}where the first two moments are fixed. The standardized version ofX∈Lμ,σis defined byX˜=X−μσ∈L0,1.Setting a = 1/σ and b = −μ/σ in Proposition 3.4we immediately obtainCorollary 3.5IfL⊆Lμ,σandX0∈L,thenRM(X0,L)=RM(X˜0,L˜),whereL˜={X˜:X∈L}. In particularRM(X0,Lμ,σ)=RM(X˜0,L0,1).In what follows we shall be mainly interested in measuring model risk with respect toLμ,σ,or some subsets. In view of the last result, we will concentrate on the particular caseL0,1,provided we standardize the reference r.v. X0.Next, we observe that, for fixed ρ andL,the relative measure of model risk comes in the form(9)RM(X0)=c1−c2ρ(X0),where c2 is positive. If ρ is a convex map, as is the case with the Expected Shortfall, or more generally with the class of (law-invariant) convex risk measures, then RM is concave.66Provided, of course, a certain convex combination of two r.v. inLremains inL.So, for instance, if X1, X2 and (X1 + X2)/2 are inLand RM(X1) = RM(X2), thenRM(X1+X22)⩾RM(X1)+RM(X2)2=RM(X1).Such an inequality can be partly explained by the fact that the model risk associated with (X1 + X2)/2 is due both to the model risk of the marginals and to the model risk of the joint distribution.Thanks to (9), we see that other possible properties for RM (like monotonicity, continuity, etc.) are inherited from similar properties of the risk measure. Subadditivity, a property which is fulfilled by all coherent risk measures, is an exception. Indeed, if we know that ρ(X1 + X2) ≤ ρ(X1) + ρ(X2), and thatX1,X2,X1+X2∈Lwe can only conclude thatRM(X1+X2)⩾RM(X1)+RM(X2)−ρ¯(L)ρ¯(L)−ρ̲(L).and subadditivity is ensured only if the last term in the right hand side is sufficiently small.In this section, we illustrate both measures of model risk and study the following example: we consider a r.v. X0 with a reference distribution in the setLμ,σ,which corresponds to the set of all r.v. with mean μ and standard deviation σ, and we estimate both measures of model risk for two measures of risk, namely VaR and Expected Shortfall. Without any loss of generality, as previously discussed, we can restrict our attention to the particular case where the set of r.v. isL0,1.Before focusing on our examples, we give a preliminary result on extremal quantiles on a general setLthat will be useful for the rest of the paper.LetLbe a general set of r.v. andF¯LandF̲Lthe extremal functions onLdefined, for any x, as:F¯L(x)=supX∈LFX(x)F̲L(x)=infX∈LFX(x).Note thatF¯L(+∞)=1,F̲L(−∞)=0and that bothF¯LandF̲Lare non-decreasing functions77Note that bothF¯LandF̲Lare not necessarily càdlàg. However the set of points on which they are not càdlàg is at most countable.. We will refer to them as the maximal function and the minimal function respectively. Note also that these functions are not necessarily distribution functions as it may happen thatF¯L(−∞)>0and/orF̲L(+∞)<1.Remark 4.1IfF¯LandF̲Lare indeed distribution functions, they are extremal in the sense of the first order stochastic dominance (denoted ≽1sd). This means thatF¯L≽1sdFX≽1sdF̲L∀X∈Land that if G and H are two distribution functions satisfying G≽1sdFX≽1sdH,∀X∈L,thenG≽1sdF¯LandF̲L≽1sdH.The following result on extremal quantiles will be very useful in the rest of the paper.Lemma 4.2Assume thatF¯L(−∞)<F̲L(+∞). IfF¯LandF̲Lare invertible functions,88Except, respectively, on the sets{x:F¯L(x)=F¯L(−∞)or1}and{x:F̲L(x)=0orF̲L(+∞)}.then for anyα∈(F¯L(−∞),F̲L(+∞))it holds(10)infX∈Lqα(X)=F¯L−1(α)andsupX∈Lqα(X)=F̲L−1(α).If bothF¯LandF̲Lare distribution functions, then (10) holds true for any α ∈ (0, 1).We prove the result for the infimum only, as a similar argument leads to the result for the supremum. Ifα>F¯L(−∞),then by assumptiona=F¯L−1(α)is well defined.Let us assume by contradiction thatb=infX∈Lqα(X)>a. Then for anyX∈Lwe have qα(X) ≥ b > a, hence FX(x) < α for x ∈ [a, b), by the very definition of quantile. It follows thatF¯L(x)⩽α=F¯L(a)for x ∈ [a, b), but this is in contrast with the fact that, by assumption,F¯Lis strictly increasing.If instead we assume that b < a, then there exists someX∈Lsuch that qα(X) < a. AsF¯Lis strictly increasing, we haveFX(qα(X))⩽F¯L(qα(X))<F¯L(a)=α.However, by definition of quantile, it always holds FX(qα(X)) ≥ α and we have reached a contradiction. We then conclude that b = a.□The following example underlines the importance of the invertibility ofF¯LandF̲Lin Lemma 4.2. Without this assumption the equalities in (10) need not hold even if we replaceF¯L−1orF̲L−1by the generalized inverses (i.e. the quantile functions). Fix α and consider the sequenceL=(Xn)n⩾1of r.v. where Xntakes the value 1 with probability1−α+1nand the value 0 with probabilityα−1n. It is easy to check thatF¯L(x)≡supnFXn(x)={0ifx<0αif0⩽x<11ifx⩾1IfX¯∼F¯L,we haveqα(X¯)=0even though qα(Xn) = 1 for any n ≥ 1. So, (10) does not hold in this case.Following Section 4 in Royden (1953) and Chapter 3, Section 4 in Hürlimann (2008), using classical Chebyshev–Markov inequalities, the extremal functions onL0,1are distributions and are given as follows:F¯L0,1(x)={11+x2ifx⩽01ifx⩾0andF̲L0,1(x)={0ifx⩽0x21+x2ifx⩾0.These extremal distributions are often called, respectively, maximal and minimal Chebyshev–Markov distributions forL0,1. Note, however, that both extremal distributionsF̲L0,1andF¯L0,1are not inL0,1. In fact, the mean ofF̲L0,1is negative, the mean ofF¯L0,1is positive and both variances are infinite.From Lemma 4.2, as bothF̲L0,1andF¯L0,1are invertible, the following identities prevail for the extremum quantiles (see for instance Hürlimann, 2002, Theorem 3.1, or Berstimas et al., 2004, Theorem 2):infX∈L0,1qα(X)=F¯L0,1−1(α)=−1−ααsupX∈L0,1qα(X)=F̲L0,1−1(α)=α1−α.As a straightforward consequence of the extremal quantiles, the following result holds true:Proposition 4.4(i) The absolute measure of model risk for VaRαat X0 is:AM(X0,L0,1)=1−ααVaRα(X0)−1.(ii) The relative measure of model risk for VaRαat X0 is:RM(X0,L0,1)=1−αα−VaRα(X0)1−αα+α1−α=(1−α)−α(1−α)VaRα(X0).This result will be illustrated later in Section 4.4.Remark 4.5Note thatsupX∈L0,1VaRα(X)>0andinfX∈L0,1VaRα(X)<0. Therefore, in the classL0,1,some distributions are acceptable, meaning that they have negative risk, while others are not. In the case ofLμ,σ,when μ > 0, ifα>σ2μ2+σ2,then all distributions are acceptable. When μ < 0, ifα<μ2μ2+σ2,then all distributions are non-acceptable.As pointed out by Hürlimann (2008)(Chapter 4, Section 3), knowledge of the skewness does not improve the Chebyshev extremal distributions when considering distributions over ( − ∞, +∞). Therefore, ifX0∈Lμ,σ:AM(X0,Lμ,σ,ξ)=AM(X0,Lμ,σ)RM(X0,Lμ,σ,ξ)=RM(X0,Lμ,σ).whereLμ,σ,ξ={X∈Lμ,σ:ξ(X)=ξ(X0)}and ξ(X) denotes the skewness of X.Adopting a similar approach for the Expected Shortfall is not so easy since Lemma 4.2 gives a result on the extremal quantiles, but not on the extremal Expected Shortfalls. However, a recent result by Berstimas et al. (2004) (Theorem 2) using arguments from convex analysis gives the following identities for the extremal Expected Shortfalls on the setL0,1:(11)infX∈L0,1ESα(X)=0(12)supX∈L0,1ESα(X)=1−αα.To our knowledge, similar results for a general setLhave not been obtained.As a straightforward consequence, the following result on model risk holds true:Proposition 4.7(i) The absolute measure of model risk for ESαat X0 is:AM(X0,L0,1)=1−ααESα(X0)−1.(ii) The relative measure of model risk for ESαat X0 is:RM(X0,L0,1)=1−αα−ESα(X0)1−αα=1−α1−αESα(X0).This result will be illustrated later in Section 4.4.Remark 4.8As mentioned earlier, we cannot use Lemma 4.2 to obtain the Extremal Shortfalls. However, we may wonder whether the Extremal Shortfalls in (11) are obtained as Expected Shortfalls of some extremal distributions. Since the Expected Shortfall is monotone with respect to the stop-loss order (see for instance Bäuerle and Müller, 2006), we look at the extremal distributions for the stop-loss order on the setL0,1. Following Hürlimann (2002), we use the fact that the stop-loss transform for a distribution F is defined as:ΠF(x)=∫x∞(1−F(y))dy.By simple calculation, we have:F(x)=1+ΠF′(x).Such a relationship also holds true for the extremal stop-loss distributions (see for instance Eq. (1.3) in Hürlimann, 2002):FmaxSL(x)=1+Πmax′(x),whereΠmax(x)≡supF∈L0,1ΠF(x),and the same holds true for the infimum.Therefore, in order to get the extremal stop-loss distributions, we first need to obtain the extremal stop-loss transforms. For the maximum stop-loss transform, we refer to Theorem 2 in Jansen et al. (1986) and obtain:Πmax(x)=x2+1−x2.For the minimum stop-loss transform, we refer to Table 5.2, Section 5, Chapter 3 in Hürlimann (2008):Πmin(x)={−xifx⩽00ifx⩾0.Finally, we obtain the extremal stop-loss distributions:FmaxSL(x)=12(1+xx2+1)andFminSL(x)={1ifx⩾00ifx<0.We finally obtain, using Eq. (11) that:ESα(FminSL)=0=infX∈L0,1ESα(X)andESα(FmaxSL)=1−αα=supX∈L0,1ESα(X).Note that using the extremal distributionsF̲L0,1andF¯L0,1for the first-order stochastic dominance will give us some bounds which are not sharp as discussed earlier in Section 2.3 (in particular Eq. (8)).We numerically compute both measures of model risk for standard (i.e. inL0,1) r.v. following the normal or Student-t distribution. We are especially interested in the dependence of the measures on the order α of the Value at Risk or the Expected Shortfall. This dependence is depicted in Figs. 3 and 4.It is natural to expect that using a reference fat-tailed distribution (Student-t) yields lower model risk than starting with a normal one. While for the Expected Shortfall this is true for any practical99Precisely, for α≲8 percent. See Figs. 3 (b) and 4 (b).value of α, for the Value-at-Risk this holds only for α small enough (α≲1.5 percent).We can also notice that the relative measure of model risk, for both VaR and Expected Shortfall and for both distributions, goes to 1 as α → 0. In other words, as we go further in the (left) tails, any given distribution departs more and more from the worst case. We think this is a general behaviour, although we offer no proof for this claim.The graphs in Fig. 5compare the absolute (a) and relative (b) measure of model risk for VaR and Expected Shortfall, using a normal reference distribution. We see that in both cases the Expected Shortfall has a lower level of model risk. By taking a Student-t as the reference distribution we obtain a similar behaviour. This is probably at odds with what we would expect: indeed, it is often said that Expected Shortfall is more sensitive to the model choice than VaR as the former depends on the whole left tail.1010See also the related discussion on statistical robustness in Cont et al. (2010).Instead, at least with respect to our two measures of model risk, the opposite proves true.In this section we introduce a local measure of model risk, by taking the limit of the relative measure RM on a family of perturbation sets that shrink to the singleton {X0}. This measure attempts to assess model risk for infinitesimal perturbations.Let(Lɛ)ɛ>0be a family of sets, each one contained inLρand such thatLɛ↘{X0}asɛ→0.This means thatLɛ⊂Lɛ′whenever ɛ < ɛ′ and∩ɛ>0Lɛ={X0}. Below, we will see some examples based on distances and on mixtures.Definition 5.1The local measure of model risk associated to ρ, X0 and the family(Lɛ)ɛ>0isLM=limɛ→0RM(X0,Lɛ)=limɛ→0ρ¯(Lɛ)−ρ(X0)ρ¯(Lɛ)−ρ̲(Lɛ),provided the limit exists.The limit defining LM is evidently in the form 0/0; however, if it exists, then it is in the interval [0, 1] as RM(X0, Lɛ) ∈ [0, 1] for any ɛ. The local measure describes the relative position of ρ(X0) with respect to the worst and best cases for infinitesimal perturbations.In what follows, we will consider the case ρ = VaRαfor some α, so thatLρis the set of all r.v. and we will make no reference at it in the definition ofLɛ. As a first example of computation of the local model risk, consider the family of sets defined by:(13)Lɛ={X:d(X,X0)⩽ɛ},where d is some given distance between distributions. It can immediately be recognized that such a family satisfies the assumptions stated above. In particular, we can consider the Kolmogorov (or uniform) distancedK(X,Y)=supx∈R|FX(x)−FY(x)|or the Lévy distancedL(X,Y)=inf{a>0:FX(x−a)−a⩽FY(x)⩽FX(x+a)+a∀x∈R}.Proposition 5.2If ρ = VaRαfor α ∈ (0, 1) and the family(Lɛ)is defined as in (13), with d = dKor d = dL, thenLM(X0,(Lɛ))=12for any absolutely continuous r.v. X0.If d = dKit can immediately be seen that(14)F¯Lɛ(x)=min{F0(x)+ɛ,1},F̲Lɛ(x)=max{F0(x)−ɛ,0}.From now on, let ɛ < min {α, 1 − α}, so thatF¯Lɛ(−∞)=ɛ<α<1−ɛ=F̲Lɛ(+∞).By assumption, F0 is invertible and therefore bothF¯LɛandF̲Lɛare invertible; an immediate computation shows thatF¯Lɛ−1(α)=F0−1(α−ɛ),F̲Lɛ−1(α)=F0−1(α+ɛ).We can then apply Lemma 4.2, obtainingsupX∈LɛVaRα(X)=−F0−1(α−ɛ),infX∈LɛVaRα(X)=−F0−1(α+ɛ)and thereforeLM=limɛ→0F0−1(α)−F0−1(α−ɛ)F0−1(α+ɛ)−F0−1(α−ɛ),asVaRα(X0)=−F0−1(α). Finally, iff0=F0′is the density of X0, by applying de l’Hôpital’s rule we haveLM=limɛ→01/f0(α−ɛ)1/f0(α+ɛ)+1/f0(α−ɛ)=12In the case d = dLwe start by observing thatF¯Lɛ(x)=min{F0(x+ɛ)+ɛ,0}andF̲Lɛ(x)=max{F0(x−ɛ)−ɛ,0}and then proceed similarly as above.□This result is quite natural as the set of perturbations is in a sense asymptotically symmetrical around X0. Therefore the relative measure of model risk converges to 1/2. However, we stress that this is true only in the limit ɛ → 0 and not for a fixed ɛ.Let F0 be the distribution ofX0∈L0,1; for ɛ < 1 define(15)Lɛ={X:X∼(1−θ)F0+θFY,Y∈L0,1,θ∈[0,ɛ]}.The setLɛcollects all (r.v. distributed as) mixtures between F0 and a distribution of a standard r.v. Y, for which the alternative distribution (FY) is not weighted too much. It is worth noting thatLɛ⊂L0,1for any ɛ: indeed, both the mean and the variance are affine functions of the distributions.Remark 5.3We stress that (1 − θ)F0 + θFYis in general not the distribution of (1 − θ)X0 + θY, even if we assume X0 and Y to be independent. Rather, it is the distribution of (1 − IA)X0 + IAY, where A is an event of probability θ, independent from both X0 and Y, and IAdenotes its indicator function.If ρ = VaRαfor α ∈ (0, 1) and the family(Lɛ)is defined as in (15), thenLM=1−α(1+VaRα(X0)2)for any absolutely continuous r.v. X0 for which VaRα(X0) ≥ 0.The maximal function forLɛisF¯Lɛ(x)=supθ∈[0,ɛ]supY∈L0,1{(1−θ)F0(x)+θFY(x)}=supθ∈[0,ɛ]{(1−θ)F0(x)+θF¯L0,1(x)}=(1−ɛ)F0(x)+ɛF¯L0,1(x),where we have usedF¯L0,1(x)−F0(x)⩾0in deriving the last equality. Since both F0 andF¯L0,1are invertible (the former by assumption),F¯Lɛtoo is invertible and therefore, applying Lemma 4.2, we have(16)supX∈LɛVaRα(X)=−F¯Lɛ−1(α).Using a similar argument, we find that(17)infX∈LɛVaRα(X)=−F̲Lɛ−1(α),whereF̲Lɛ(x)=(1−ɛ)F0(x)+ɛF̲L0,1(x). As a consequence, the local measure of model risk is(18)LM=limɛ→0−F¯Lɛ−1(α)−VaRα(X0)−F¯Lɛ−1(α)+F̲Lɛ−1(α).If we setψ¯(ɛ)=F¯Lɛ−1(α),then, by definition(1−ɛ)F0(ψ¯(ɛ))+ɛF¯L0,1(ψ¯(ɛ))=α.Differentiating (in ɛ) both sides, we obtainf0(ψ¯)ψ¯′+F¯L0,1(ψ¯)−F0(ψ¯)+ɛ(F¯L0,1′(ψ¯)−f0(ψ¯)ψ¯′=0,wheref0=F0′is the density of X0. Setting ɛ = 0 and observing thatψ¯(0)=F0−1(α)=−VaRα(X0),so thatF0(ψ¯(0))=α,we readily obtain1111A similar proof can also be found in Barrieu and Ravanelli (2013).ψ¯′(0)=α−F¯L0,1(−VaRα(X0))f0(−VaRα(X0)).In a very similar way, we can prove thatψ̲(ɛ)=F̲Lɛ−1(α)satisfiesψ̲′(0)=α−F̲L0,1(−VaRα(X0))f0(−VaRα(X0)).Applying de l’Hôpital’s rule to (18) and simplifying the result we obtainLM=F¯L0,1(−VaRα(X0))−αF¯L0,1(−VaRα(X0))−F̲L0,1(−VaRα(X0)).As − VaRα(X0) ≤ 0 by assumption, we haveF¯L0,1(−VaRα(X0))=11+VaRα(X0)2,F̲L0,1(−VaRα(X0))=0and we reach the final result as an immediate computation.□Remembering the form ofF¯L0,1andF̲L0,1,from (16) and (17) it easily follows that, if α is not too large,1212It is sufficient to assume α ≤ (1 − ɛ)F0(0).r=supX∈LɛVaRα(X)is the unique solution of(1−ɛ)F0(−r)+ɛ1+r2=α,whileinfX∈LɛVaRα(X)=VaRα1−ɛ(X0).This result allows us to compute the relative measure of model risk with respect toLɛfor finite values of ɛ.As an illustration we compute the local measure of model risk when X0 is standard normal or Student-t (see Fig. 6). Consistent with the observations we made in the last section, regarding the relative measure, we see that starting with a fat-tailed reference distribution yields a lower local measure with respect to a normal distribution only when α is small enough.
