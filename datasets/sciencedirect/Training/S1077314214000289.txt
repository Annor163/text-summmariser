@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we present a novel fast and accurate numerical method for the surface embedding narrow volume reconstruction from unorganized points inR3. Though the level set method prevails in the image processing, it requires a redistancing procedure to maintain a desired shape of the level set function. On the other hand, our method is based on the Allen–Cahn equation, which has been applied in image segmentation due to its motion by mean curvature property. We modify the original Allen–Cahn equation by multiplying a control function to restrict the evolution within a narrow band around the given surface data set. To improve the numerical stability of our proposed model, we split the governing equation into linear and nonlinear terms and use an operator splitting technique. The linear equation is solved by the multigrid method which is a fast solver and the nonlinear equation is solved analytically. The unconditional stability of the proposed scheme is also proved. Various numerical results are presented to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The industry of rapid prototyping and 3D printing has emerged in past years, and the 3D printing technology to visualize objects in space is now one of the issues in mathematics [1] and computer science [2]. This work has been motivated by the need for 3D printing [3,4] from surface data. The basic mechanism of the 3D printer is that it builds up the object layer by layer. However, a surface is two-dimensional (see Fig. 1(a)) and its slices are in general one-dimensional, which 3D printer cannot build up a three-dimensional object. Hence, to print the surface with a 3D printer, we need to thicken up the surface and make a surface embedding narrow volume (Fig. 1(b)). Fig. 1(c) shows a physical model manufactured from the proposing mathematical model. Even though we were motivated by 3D surface printing, our proposing algorithm is general so that the algorithm can be applied to other applications such as geometry processing [5], tolerance analysis in machine processing [6], and collision detection [7,8].Up to now, a great number of algorithms have been proposed to solve the offset surface reconstruction problems. In [9], Liu and Wang approximated both the zero-level surface and its offset surface using an implicit function. They also developed a fast offset surface generation method via a narrow band signed distance-field [10]. In addition, Chen and Wang proposed thickening operations to convert a surface to a solid [11] and introduced a uniform offsetting model [12]. It enables to generate both grown and shrunk models from arbitrary offset distance. Curless and Levoy developed two important techniques for reconstructing complex and accurate models from scanned objects: spacetime analysis, d based on analyzing the time evolution of the structured light reflections [13], and a volumetric space carving technique for integrating several data into a single geometric model [14]. Lien [15] and Varadhan and Manocha [16] demonstrated representations of the Minkowski sum boundary. To get high-quality offsets, an adaptive octree-structure was used for distance bounds in [17]. Small and thin features were detected by subdivisional methods [18,19]. For some other considerations of offset surface reconstruction, we also refer to [20,21]. Recently, Wang and Manocha [22] presented a highly parallel method to compute the approximate offsetting on models represented by structured points in layered depth images (LDIs). The main idea is to compute the super-union of all the balls centered at the sample points, which can be conducted efficiently on the graphics processing unit with LDI representation. As compared to prior CPU-based approximation offsetting algorithms, their approach results in more than 100 times speedups.Our approach is basically an implicit representation of interface as an isosurface of the level set function [23–25]. The level set method for numerical interface evolution has been successfully used for surface reconstruction, including texture objects [26–31]. Zhao et al. solved shape reconstruction problems by using a minimal-surface-like model and the level set method [30,31]. However, for offset surface reconstruction problem, the calculation of unsigned distance function is a challenging problem because the offset distance is generally small and the given surface is not closed. To solve these problems, we present a novel fast and accurate numerical method for surface embedding narrow volume reconstruction from an unorganized surface data set. Our method is based on the Allen–Cahn (AC) equation [32], which has been applied to image processing problems such as segmentation, denoising, and inpainting [33–39]. We choose the AC equation because it has intrinsic smoothing effect on interfacial transition layers and its fast and accurate hybrid numerical solver is available [40]. We modify the original AC equation by multiplying a control function to restrict the evolution within a narrow band around the given surface data set. The stability of numerical schemes for equations is very important. Explicit time integration schemes are generally only conditionally stable and require small time steps to insure numerical stability. Using an operator splitting technique, we propose the scheme that allows the use of a sufficiently large time step without the technical limitations. We also prove the unconditional stability of the proposed scheme.This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe the main governing equation and we describe the numerical solution and prove its unconditional stability. In Section 3, we perform some characteristic numerical experiments for volume reconstruction. Finally, our conclusion is given in Section 4.
