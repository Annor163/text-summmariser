@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The quantitative analysis of vocal disorders by nonlinear signal processing methods has been extensively used in the last two decades. In this work, two algorithms for nonlinear time-series analysis, Sample Entropy and cross-Sample Entropy, are used on electroglottogram (EGG) and microphone (MIC) signals recorded from 51 normal and 80 dysphonic subjects, to obtain summary measures of voice disorders through SampEn and cross-SampEn indices. Such parameters quantify, respectively, the degree of irregularity (in the sense of self-dissimilarity) within a time-series and of asynchrony (in the sense of cross-dissimilarity) between two distinct time-series. The aims of this work are: to determine if statistically significant differences in terms of signal irregularity quantified by SampEn occur between normal and pathological subjects, investigating whether or not such differences can be equally seen in EGG and MIC; to assess if cross-SampEn reveals different degrees of asynchrony between EGG and MIC signals in the two groups. Results show that SampEn in pathological subjects is higher than in normal subjects for both EGG and MIC time-series, with a statistically significant difference detectable from both signals (Pe<10−4 for EGG and Pe<10−7 for MIC). Cross-SampEn exhibits a statistically significant difference too, showing a higher degree of cross-dissimilarity between EGG and MIC time-series for pathological subjects (Pe<10−4). In conclusion, SampEn and cross-SampEn well quantify the increase of complexity of both EGG and MIC signals and the decrease of their cross-similarity in presence of vocal disorders. Thanks to the complementarity of nonlinear indicators to the traditionally considered linear ones, SampEn and cross-SampEn appear as suitable candidates to enter the pool of approaches to investigate speech pathologies and to obtain potentially new insights on their nature.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Voice, the most important vehicle of communication between human beings, is generated by the expired airflow through the vibration of the vocal folds and the resonance of the oral cavity. The signal recordable by a microphone (MIC) results from a complex interaction between laryngeal and vocal tracts and is thus influenced by several physiological phenomena, related to vocal fold biomechanics, aerodynamic variables and articulator filtering. The electroglottogram signal (EGG) which can be acquired using the so-called laryngograph, on the other hand, describes the trans-laryngeal electric impedance variations that accompany vocal fold vibration during phonation and allows to investigate the behavior of the vocal folds without any influence of the vocal tract above the larynx. As shown in the representative traces of Fig. 1(normal subject) and Fig. 2(pathological subject), MIC signals qualitatively seem to exhibit a higher “degree of complexity” than EGG, reflecting the additional role of supraglottal cavities in the process of voice production. Furthermore, both EGG and MIC time-series seem to display an increased irregularity in pathological people, as one can immediately appreciate by comparing the traces of the representative normal (Fig. 1) and pathological (Fig. 2) subjects.To reduce the subjectivity related to the perceptual “qualitative” evaluation of dysphonic voices made by speech and language therapists, the quantitative analysis of EGG and MIC signals has become a commonly used tool for the clinical investigation of vocal disorders and several signal processing techniques mostly based on spectral analysis have been proposed [1]. For instance, fundamental frequency (F0), jitter and shimmer, become traditional parameters for the assessment of voice quality, have been widely used to evaluate perturbation contents in pathological voices [1,2] (even if they actually seem to be sensitive to a number of experimental and methodological settings [3]). Due to their linearity, however, indices based on spectral analysis have appeared unsuited to easily handle signal variations and cycles whose timing is inherently irregular, as it may occur in pathological states, and thus the use of the above parameters has been questioned. Several authors, in particular, demonstrated that linear analysis tools can reliably investigate only (nearly) periodic Type 1 voices [1,3,4], typically exhibited by normal subjects only. In fact, although a recent work developed by Dejonckere et al. reported that limitations typically referred to jitter measurements are probably too tight [5], there is a general agreement that the above classic parameters are sufficient/appropriate to analyze neither voices with subharmonic frequencies or no apparent periodic structure, defined in [1] respectively as Type 2 and Type 3, nor voices contaminated by high levels of random noise, defined in [6] as Type 4. Moreover, several studies suggested that some aspects observed in vocal fold vibration can be interpreted in terms of nonlinear dynamics [7–9] and, for instance, Herzel et al. described complexity of pathological voices as the result of nonlinear processes in the movement of the vocal folds [10]. These new insights on the process of voice production stimulated research on nonlinear methods to study vocal disorders [3,10–13] and the use of entropy measures has been explored in this context [14]. Zhang et al., in particular, widely investigated the ability of nonlinear techniques to assess voice quality, comparing well-established nonlinear methods such as phase space reconstruction and correlation dimension, with classically performed perturbation measures [3] and evaluating the ability of these nonlinear approaches to characterize voicing before and after surgical excision of vocal polyps [12]. They found out that correlation dimension and second order entropy exhibit a statistically significant decrease after surgery, while shimmer does not show a significant postsurgical decrease (although jitter does). A work published by Yan et al. in 2013 [15] investigated the ability of the correlation dimension to distinguish between normal laryngeal speech and two types of alaryngeal voicing, detecting a statistically significant difference between them. However, the authors found that the correlation dimension was very time-consuming and cumbersome to calculate for the user, unsuited to noisy datasets and strongly correlated with a much simpler to define and calculate indicator, the SampEn index discussed in the following. Although nonlinear analysis overcomes the limitations of classic linear indices and appears suitable for the assessment of Type 2–3 signals too, Sprecher et al. found out that neither traditional perturbation measures nor correlation dimension seem to be reliable for the assessment of Type 4 voices, because of their high levels of stochastic noise [6].In the context of entropy measures, the Approximate Entropy algorithm developed by Pincus in [16] provides an entropy measure, the ApEn index, which quantifies the degree of irregularity of a time-series: the higher the ApEn value, the greater the irregularity. ApEn is a nonnegative number which can be related to the logarithmic likelihood that patterns in the sequence that are close (within a certain tolerance) remain close on next incremental comparison and thus measures the self-dissimilarity within a time-series. Notably, as it will be more clear from the mathematical definition recalled in Section 2.2, this notion of irregularity does not rely with the timing and cycles of the patterns. ApEn is applicable to relatively short and noisy data sets and, for this reason, has been widely used to study biological signals [17] (e.g. endocrine-metabolic [18,19], heart [20–22], hemodynamic [23] and EEG [24,25] time-series). Thus, ApEn can be a candidate for an objective voice assessment through a single parameter, which could be able to discriminate between normal and pathological states. To the best of our knowledge, only a few contributions have investigated ApEn applications on MIC and EGG signals to quantify voice quality [26–29]. In particular, Moore et al. analyzed the spectral pattern of EGG time-series from a healthy male population and used the obtained ApEn values to build a reference standard for normal subjects, against which aberrant phonation were compared [26]. In the same study, ApEn was used as the tool for testing normal vocal fold functionality of a group of larynx cancer males after radiotherapy. In [27], ApEn values in 2/3 of pathological cases were shown to tend to those of normal patients one year after irradiation. In [28], Douglas and co-workers demonstrated that EGG ApEn measures were able to discriminate between normal subjects and pre-treatment patients with glottis squamous cell carcinoma. Manickam et al. in [29] computed ApEn from EGG in the time domain and reported that, in many pathological cases, normal ApEn values could be restored after one year of radiotherapy. In a different physiological context [30], Moore et al. used ApEn to study the effect of growth hormone deficiency on voice abnormalities.A slightly improved version of ApEn is SampEn, a complexity measure obtained from the Sample Entropy algorithm developed by Richman and Moorman in [31]. SampEn, as well as ApEn, is a measure of self-dissimilarity within a time series and overcomes the fact that ApEn is biased due to the presence of self-matches in its definition [31]. To the best of our knowledge, the first application of SampEn to the study of vocal disorders has been proposed in 2013 (just while the present ms was submitted) in [15] where SampEn was shown to be well correlated to correlation dimension, but much more easy to calculate and robust against noise.A possibly interesting task in nonlinear time-series analysis is also to assess the complexity of a couple of signals. A rather simple candidate indicator for such a scope is cross-SampEn, defined in [31] as an evolution of the cross-ApEn index originally proposed by Pincus [32] to measure the asynchrony (in the sense of cross-dissimilarity) of two hormones belonging to the same physiologic network. High cross-SampEn values are correlated to time-series presenting patterns which (independently on their timing) have a little probability of appearing in both.The purpose of our work is to further investigate the use of entropy measures to assess vocal disorders. In particular, we will investigate the ability of EGG/MIC SampEn and cross-SampEn to distinguish between normal and pathological voices. A first novelty with respect to previous contributions is that we will study both EGG and MIC signals, the aim being to assess whether or not SampEn differences between normal and pathological voices are equally visible from the two signals. The second novelty of the present work concerns the assessment of the cross-similarity between EGG and MIC time-series made by the cross-SampEn algorithm [31]. In particular, by considering a data base of EGG and MIC signals recorded on 51 normal subjects and 80 pathological subjects, we will determine: if statistically significant SampEn differences between normal and pathological groups can be found and whether or not such differences are more easily detectable in one of EGG and MIC signals; if cross-SampEn can reveal different degrees of cross-similarity between EGG and MIC in healthy and pathological subjects.The analysis involved a total of 131 subjects, collected at the Cà Foncello Regional Hospital, Treviso, Italy, and classified in two different groups according to the independent perceptual evaluation of speech and language therapists. In particular, 51 subjects appeared to be normal and 80 were classified as pathological. The normal group was composed of 27 males, aged between 13 and 64 years old (mean=29.74, sd=11.42), and 24 females, aged between 16 and 47 (mean=31.17, sd=9.07); the pathological one of 30 males, aged between 3 and 76 years old (mean=41.07, sd=21.49), and 50 females, between 4 and 74 years old (mean=41.2, sd=18.38). Pathologies affecting the subjects included functional/dysfunctional dysphonia, vocal cord polyps or nodules, unilateral/bilateral vocal fold paralysis, Reinke edema, vocal cord tremors or consequences of vocal cord surgical operations. Pathological voices included Type 2 and Type 3 signals defined in [1]. All subjects were informed about the aim of the analysis. Each subject was comfortably seated in a silent room and asked to emit the Italian vowel/a/for at least 4s, trying to keep pitch and intensity constant. During the task, EGG and MIC signals were acquired synchronously as described in the following. The EGG was collected by a commercial system (Laryngograph Ltd., London, UK) employing two metal electrodes with contact surfaces of about 2–3cm2, placed on both sides of the neck, at the same level of the thyroid cartilages. The EGG signal was obtained using a high frequency (0.3–5MHz) and low intensity (<20mA) alternate current sent through the electrodes, that allowed to measure the trans-larynx electrical impedance variation, depending on the degree of contact of the vocal folds. The MIC signal was acquired by a commercial dynamic directional microphone (Prologue Shure, USA), placed at a distance of less than 5cm from the lips, in order to reduce disturbance components, and with an axial slope of 45° [33]. In case of particularly strong voices, the input gain was adjusted at every recording, to avoid the saturation of the acquisition system. Both EGG and MIC signals were captured by a digital spectrograph (CSL 4300B, Kay Elemetrics, USA), with 50kHz of sampling rate and 16 bits of amplitude resolution.The analysis documented in the following sections was developed considering only the middle, stationary appearing, segment of 1s of the acquired signals (i.e. N=50,000 samples, for both EGG and MIC time-series). Representative portions of the two signals recorded in normal subject #15 and pathological subject #42 are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively (the pathological subject would be classified as Type 3 according to [1]). Entropy measures were obtained using algorithms implemented by us in MATLAB.SampEn is an index introduced in [31] and derived from approaches developed by Grassberger and co-workers [34]. The inception of SampEn is a development of ApEn, see Ref. [31] for details. Briefly, for a time-series of N equally spaced samples, having fixed a positive integer m and a positive real r, SampEn(m, r, N) is the negative natural logarithm of the conditional probability that two patterns similar for m consecutive points, within a tolerance r, remain similar at the next point (self-matches are not considered). Thus, SampEn is a measure of the degree of irregularity of a sequence, and a lower SampEn value indicates more self-similarity and regularity in the analyzed time-series.More in detail, to calculate SampEn for an evenly sampled time-series {u{k}}, k=1, 2, ..., N, the positive integer m is first chosen. Then, N−m vectors inℝm,xm(1),xm(2),...,xm(N−m), are defined as:xm(i)=u(i)u(i+1)⋯u(i+m−1)T, with 1≤i≤N−m. Given the positive real r, for all i≤N−m, the quantityBim(r)is defined as:(1)Bim(r)=#of vectorsxm(j)j≠isuch thatd[xm(i),xm(j)]≤rN−m−1with 1≤j≤N−m. Since j≠i, self-matches are not counted in the numerator of Eq. (1) (as it would be in ApEn). The distance d[xm(i),xm(j)] that appears in Eq. (1) is defined for k=1,...,m as:(2)d[xm(i),xm(j)]=max(|u(i+k−1)−u(j+k−1)|).Similarly, for all i≤N−m, the quantityAim(r)is defined for vectorsxm+1(1),xm+1(2), …,xm+1(N−m) inℝm+1as:Aim(r)=#of vectorsxm+1(j)j≠isuch thatd[xm+1(i),xm+1(j)]≤rN−m−1with 1≤j≤N−m. Then, mean values ofBim(r)andAim(r)are calculated as:Bm(r)=1N−m∑i=1N−mBim(r)Am(r)=1N−m∑i=1N−mAim(r)SampEn is finally defined as the negative natural logarithm of the ratio betweenAim(r)andBim(r):SampEn(N,m,r)=−lnAm(r)Bm(r)In Ref. [31], Richman and Moorman developed SampEn with the aim of removing a bias effect caused by self-matching which affects ApEn. The necessity of discounting self-matches was explained on the grounds that entropy is conceived as a measure of the rate of information production, and in this context comparing data with themselves, as it would be done in ApEn, is meaningless.To determine m and r, the same empirical suggestions made for ApEn in [16,17,35], i.e. choose m such that 10mis of the order of N and r between 0.1 and 0.25 times the sample signal standard deviation (SD), can be used.Cross-SampEn, defined in [31], is an evolution of the cross-ApEn index originally proposed by Pincus [32]. It quantifies the degree of asynchrony/dissimilarity between two signals produced by the same physiological network, e.g. time-series with little synchrony result in high cross-SampEn values.In detail, to calculate cross-SampEn, a preliminary step consists in the normalization of each of the two signals by subtracting its mean value and dividing by its SD. Then, the two time-series, with zero mean and unitary SD,{u{k}}and{v(k)}k=1,2,...,Nare obtained. Once the parameters m and r are fixed with the same criteria described in Section 2.2, N−m vectorsxm(1),xm(2),..., xm(N−m) and N−m vectorsym(1),ym(2),…,ym(N−m) inℝmare defined respectively from {u(k)} and{v(k)}:xm(i)=u(i)u(i+1)⋯⋯u(i+m−1)Tym(j)=v(j)v(j+1)⋯⋯v(j+m−1)Twith i, j=1,...,N−m. Given the positive integer r, for all i≤N−m, the quantityBim(r)(vu)is defined as:Bim(r)(v||u)=#of vectorsym(j)such thatd[xm(i),ym(j)]≤rN−mwhere j ranges from 1 to N−m and the distance d[xm(i), ym(i)] is obtained as in Eq. (2). Then, the mean value of theBim(r)(vu)returns the quantity:Bm(r)(v||u)=1N−m∑i=1N−mBim(r)(v||u)Similarly, for all i≤N−m, the quantityAim(r)(vu)is defined from the vectorsxm+1(1),xm+1(2),...,xm+1(N−m) and ym+1(1), ym+1(2),..., ym+1(N−m) inℝm+1as:Aim(r)(v||u)=#of vectorsym+1(j)such thatd[xm+1(i),ym+1(j)]≤rN−mwith 1≤j≤N−m. The mean value of theAim(r)(vu)returns:Am(r)(v||u)=1N−m∑i=1N−mAim(r)(v||u)Cross-SampEn(N, m, r) index is finally obtained as:cross-SampEn(N,m,r)=−lnAm(v||u)Bm(v||u)

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Quantitative evaluation of vocal disorders based on EGG/MIC time-series analysis classically resorts to linear spectral techniques and summary parameters like fundamental frequency, jitter and shimmer, that allow to investigate periodicity features of the signals. Such methods, however, are nowadays believed to be insufficient for a comprehensive study of pathological voices and nonlinear approaches to obtain complementary information have been recently proposed, including the entropy measures and ApEn in particular. In this paper, a nonlinear approach based on the combined use of two entropy measures, SampEn and cross-SampEn, was considered in the investigation of vocal signals in normal and pathological subjects. These nonlinear indices are complexity measures that allow to quantify, respectively, the degree of self-dissimilarity within a time-series (often called “irregularity” in the jargon of the specific literature) and of cross-dissimilarity between two distinct time-series (often called “asynchrony” in the same jargon). With respect to existing literature contributions, our work presents two main novelties. First of all, we considered simultaneous recordings of EGG and MIC signals in order to find out whether or not SampEn differences between normal and pathological subjects are more easily detectable with one of the two time-series. Results showed that SampEn values are significantly higher in pathological subjects for both EGG and MIC, with p-values well under 0.05 in both cases. Thus, the two signals appeared equally suitable to discriminate between normal and pathological subjects. Moreover, SampEn values were always higher in MIC than in EGG, reflecting the complexity added by the vocal tract resonance in the process of MIC signal generation. The second novelty of the present work is that we explored the use of cross-SampEn to study the cross-similarity between EGG and MIC signals, founding a statistically significant difference between the two groups as well, with a lower degree of cross-similarity for pathological signals with respect to normal ones. Results suggest that signal complexity measured by SampEn reflects irregularity increase from EGG to MIC due to the well-established additional role of the oral cavity in the process of voice production. Moreover, speech pathologies seem to strongly increase the disorder of both EGG and MIC signals, due to the nonlinear behavior of the vocal folds and reduce their cross-similarity probably because of an empowered nonlinearity effect of the vocal tract resonance.In conclusion, SampEn and cross-SampEn well quantify the increase of complexity of both EGG and MIC signals and their decrease of cross-similarity in presence of vocal disorders and appear as suitable candidates to enter that pool of nonlinear techniques for the investigation of speech pathologies which already includes measures such as correlation dimension, Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov entropy already proposed in [3,6,10–15]. In a practical context, these nonlinear indices are, in general, complementary to the more established perturbation measures and their use can become particularly useful when, because of abnormal situations, the latter become unreliable (e.g. Type 2–4 voices). A comparison among different measures for the assessment of voice disorders is out of the scope of the present manuscript, but deserves further investigation, especially because some indices appear correlated but with greatly different algorithmic complexity, see [15] for a preliminary study on SampEn and correlation dimension, while some others can be orthogonal each other and for this reason may offer complementary insights in the assessment of voice. From the application point of view, further development of our study may concern the use of a larger dataset to investigate whether or not SampEn and cross-SampEn can distinguish between pathologies of different severity; moreover, the ability of such measures in the assessment of Type 4 voices may also be investigated.
