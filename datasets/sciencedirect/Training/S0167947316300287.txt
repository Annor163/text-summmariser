@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Quantile inference with adjustment for covariates has not been widely investigated on competing risks data. We propose covariate-adjusted quantile inferences based on the cause-specific proportional hazards regression of the cumulative incidence function. We develop the construction of confidence intervals for quantiles of the cumulative incidence function given a value of covariates and for the difference of quantiles based on the cumulative incidence functions between two treatment groups with common covariates. Simulation studies show that the procedures perform well. We illustrate the proposed methods using early stage breast cancer data.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In survival analysis, the median survival time has been frequently used as a measure for summarizing the survival curve. Many authors proposed methods for constructing confidence intervals for the median survival time based on the Kaplan–Meier estimator (Reid, 1981; Brookmeyer and Crowley, 1982; Emerson, 1982; Slud et al., 1984; Jennison and Turnbull, 1985) and for the difference between two median survival times in the two-sample problem (Wang and Hettmansperger, 1990; Su and Wei, 1993). However, such quantile analyses have not been widely investigated in the context of competing risks. The analyses can be carried out using the cumulative incidence function. Peng and Fine (2007) proposed nonparametric quantile inferences for competing risks data using the cumulative incidence function. Lee and Fine (2011) proposed parametric quantile inferences based on the cumulative incidence function, along with simplified procedures for the nonparametric quantile inference. Jeong and Fine (2009) and Jeong (2014) proposed nonparametric and parametric inferences for the quantile residual lifetime under competing risks, respectively. In practice, however, covariate information is often available which provides useful information about event times. In this paper, we incorporate covariates into an analysis by assuming the effects of covariates on cause-specific hazard functions to satisfy proportional hazards models and propose covariate-adjusted quantile inferences under the cause-specific proportional hazards regression of the cumulative incidence function.As alternative to the subdistribution proportional hazards model (Fine and Gray, 1999), Peng and Fine (2009) proposed quantile regression with competing risks data, which formulates a regression model based on conditional quantiles defined using the cumulative incidence function. Hsieh et al. (2013) and Li and Peng (2015) studied quantile regression under the semi-competing risks setting. Lim and Jeong (2015) proposed a regression model on quantile residual life under competing risks. These works focus on developing inference procedures for estimating regression parameters in a quantile regression model. The focus of this paper is to develop covariate-adjusted quantile inference procedures for summarizing the cumulative incidence curve with adjustment for covariates.LetTbe the time to failure andϵ∈{1,…,K}be the cause of failure. LetZbe ap×1vector of time-independent covariates. The cause-specific hazard function for causekat timetconditional on covariatesZis given byλk(t;Z)=limΔt→0Pr(t≤T<t+Δt,ϵ=k∣T≥t,Z)Δt.The cumulative incidence function for causekby timetconditional onZis given byFk(t;Z)=Pr(T≤t,ϵ=k∣Z),which can be expressed in terms of the cause-specific hazard function as followsFk(t;Z)=∫0tS(u;Z)λk(u;Z)du,whereS(t;Z)=Pr(T>t∣Z)is the overall survival function conditional onZ. Note that the asymptote of the cumulative incidence function is less than 1, which implies thatFk(t;Z)is an improper function. Therefore, defining a mean does not make sense since it is always infinite. Quantiles, which are finite and may be identifiable from observed data, can be used as a measure for summarizing the cumulative incidence curve.Employing a general notation of the quantile function, thepth quantile ofFk(t;Z)is defined byFk−1(p;Z)=inf{t:Fk(t;Z)≥p}.Thepth quantile ofFk(t;Z)can be estimated byFˆk−1(p;Z)=inf{t:Fˆk(t;Z)≥p}. For the covariate-adjusted quantile inference, we consider the cause-specific hazard approach (Prentice et al., 1978) and assume the proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) for the cause-specific hazard function. Cheng et al. (1998) proposed estimation methods of the cumulative incidence function based on the proportional hazards regression for the cause-specific hazards. We use their methods to estimate the cumulative incidence function under the cause-specific proportional hazards model.Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982) proposed a nonparametric confidence interval for the median survival time by inverting a generalized sign test for censored data asIα={t:{Sˆ(t)−0.5}2var̂(Sˆ(t))≤χ1,α2},whereSˆ(t)is the Kaplan–Meier estimator (Kaplan and Meier, 1958),var̂(Sˆ(t))is the Greenwood variance estimator ofSˆ(t)(Greenwood, 1926), andχ1,α2is the100αupper percentile of the chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom, that is,Pr(χ12>χ1,α2)=α. Su and Wei (1993) extended the approach to the two-sample problem and proposed a nonparametric confidence interval for the difference or ratio of two median survival times. Other authors used this inversion method to construct confidence intervals for the difference or ratio of two median survival times for paired observations with censoring and under the proportional hazards or stratified proportional hazards models (Jung and Su, 1995; Karrison, 1995; Kim, 2001; Chen and Chang, 2007). In this paper, we develop the construction of confidence intervals for quantiles of the cumulative incidence function given a value of covariates by inverting a test statistic following Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982), which is an extension of Lee and Fine (2011) for the one sample case. We also derive confidence intervals for the difference of quantiles based on the cumulative incidence functions between two treatment groups with common covariates by inverting a test statistic following Su and Wei (1993).We evaluate the performance of the covariate-adjusted quantile inference in the simulation studies. We illustrate our methods with early stage breast cancer data.For simplicity, we consider two causes of failure,ϵ∈{1,2}. DefineX=min(T,C), whereTandCare the failure time and censoring time, respectively. We assumed that the censoring timeCis independent of (T,ϵ) conditional onZ. Letδ=I(T≤C)ϵ, whereI(⋅)is the indicator function. The observed data consist of(Xi,δi,Zi)(i=1,…,n).We assume the proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) for each of the cause-specific hazard functions as,λk(t;Z)=λ0k(t)exp(β0kTZ),k=1,2,whereλ0k(t)is an unspecified baseline hazard function for causekandβ0kis ap×1parameter vector for causek. Under the Cox model, the cumulative incidence function for causekconditional onZ=z0is expressed byFk(t;z0)=∫0tS(u;z0)exp(β0kTz0)λ0k(u)du,k=1,2,whereS(t;z0)=exp{−∑k=12∫0tλk(u;z0)du}=exp{−∑k=12Λ0k(t)exp(β0kTz0)}andΛ0k(t)is the cumulative hazard function forλ0k(t).Cheng et al. (1998) proposed to estimate the cumulative incidence function as(1)Fˆk(t;z0)=∫0tSˆ(u;z0)exp(βˆkTz0)dΛˆ0k(u)=∑i=1nSˆ(Xi;z0)exp(βˆkTz0)I(δi=k)I(Xi≤t)∑j=1nI(Xi≤Xj)exp(βˆkTZj),whereSˆ(t;z0)=exp{−∑k=12Λˆ0k(t)exp(βˆkTz0)},βˆkis the maximum likelihood estimator forβ0kobtained by maximizing the partial likelihood treating failure timesTiwithϵi≠kas censored (Prentice et al., 1978), andΛˆ0k(t)is the Breslow (1974) estimator forΛ0k(t).Thepth quantile ofFk(t;z0)is estimated byFˆk−1(p;z0)=inf{t:Fˆk(t;z0)≥p}.Cheng et al. (1998) showed thatn{Fˆk(t;z0)−Fk(t;z0)}converges weakly to a Gaussian process with mean zero and varianceσk2(t;z0), which can be consistently estimated byσˆk2(t;z0)given by (A.1) in the Appendix. At a fixed time pointt,n{Fˆk(t;z0)−Fk(t;z0)}⟶dN(0,σk2(t;z0)).Then,n{Fˆk(t;z0)−Fk(t;z0)}2σˆk2(t;z0)⟶dχ12.Suppose that we are interested in testing a hypothesisH0:Fk(t;z0)=p. Under the null hypothesisH0,n{Fˆk(t;z0)−p}2σˆk2(t;z0)⟶dχ12.Following Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982), an asymptotic100(1−α)%confidence interval forFk−1(p;z0)can be obtained by inverting the test statistic. It is given by(2)Iα={t:n{Fˆk(t;z0)−p}2σˆk2(t;z0)≤χ1,α2}.We consider comparing quantiles of the cumulative incidence functions for causekbetween two different groups with adjustment for covariates. LetFk(r)(t;z0)be the cumulative incidence function for causekin groupr(r=1,2) andθk(r)(p;z0)be thepth quantile ofFk(r)(t;z0). LetFˆk(r)(t;z0)be the cumulative incidence estimator for causek, estimated as in (1), in groupr. Suppose that we are interested in making inferences aboutτ=θk(1)(p;z0)−θk(2)(p;z0), which is the difference of thepth quantiles ofFkbetween two groups with common covariatesz0. We consider the quantity asWk(τ,θk(1)(p;z0))={Fˆk(1)(θk(1)(p;z0);z0)−p}2σˆk(1)(θˆk(1)(p;z0);z0)2/n+{Fˆk(2)(θk(1)(p;z0)−τ;z0)−p}2σˆk(2)(θˆk(2)(p;z0);z0)2/n,whereσˆk(r)(t;z0)2is the variance estimator ofn{Fˆk(r)(t;z0)}, computed as in (A.1) in groupr. As described in Su and Wei (1993),θk(1)(p;z0)can be regarded as a nuisance parameter and eliminated by minimizingWk(τ,θk(1)(p;z0))with respect toθk(1)(p;z0), giving the minimum dispersion test statisticGk(τ)=infθk(1)(p;z0)Wk(τ,θk(1)(p;z0)).Suppose that the null hypothesis isH0:τ=τ0. Then, under the null hypothesisH0,Gk(τ0)is asymptotically chi-square distributed with 1 degree of freedom, which can be derived mimicking arguments given in Appendix of Su and Wei (1993). An asymptotic100(1−α)%confidence interval forτ0can be constructed by inverting the test statistic(3)Iα={τ:Gk(τ)<χ1,α2}.Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of covariate-adjusted quantile inferences. In the first scenario, covariatesZ1andZ2were generated from a Bernoulli distribution with success probability 0.5 and the standard normal distribution, respectively. We assumed that the baseline cause-specific hazard functions for causes 1 and 2 are that of an exponential distribution and Gompertz distribution, respectively. That is, givenZ1=z1andZ2=z2,λ1(t;z1,z2)=α1exp(β11z1+β12z2)andλ2(t;z1,z2)=exp(α2+α3t)exp(β21z1+β22z2). The true parameter is(α1,β11,β12,α2,α3,β21,β22)=(0.1,0.3,0.5,−6,0.4,1,−1.5). The failure timeTwas generated from1−S(t;Z1,Z2), whereS(t;z1,z2)=exp(−∫0tλ1(u;z1,z2)du−∫0tλ2(u;z1,z2)du). The types 1 and 2 failures were generated from a Bernoulli distribution with success probabilityλ1(T;Z1,Z2)/{λ1(T;Z1,Z2)+λ2(T;Z1,Z2)}. The censoring timeCwas generated from a uniform distributionU(0,γC), whereγCwas chosen to achieve the desired censoring proportion. Under this setting, we had 64% failures from cause 1 and 36% failures from cause 2 in the absence of censoring. We conducted 1000 simulations with sample sizes of 200 and 400.Table 1shows the true values, biases, and empirical coverage probabilities (CP) of 95% confidence intervals given in (2) for the 0.1th and 0.3th quantiles ofF1conditional onZ1=1andZ2=0.3, that is,F1−1(0.1;Z1=1,Z2=0.3)andF1−1(0.3;Z1=1,Z2=0.3). The biases are small and the empirical coverage probabilities are close to the nominal level.In the second scenario, covariatesZ1andZ2were generated from a Bernoulli distribution with success probability 0.5, respectively, and a covariateZ3was generated from the standard normal distribution. We assumed that the baseline cause-specific hazard functions for causes 1 and 2 are that of an exponential distribution and Gompertz distribution, respectively. That is, givenZ1=z1,Z2=z2, andZ3=z3,λ1(t;z1,z2,z3)=α1exp(β11z1+β12z2+β13z3)andλ2(t;z1,z2,z3)=exp(α2+α3t)exp(β21z1+β22z2+β23z3). The true parameter is(α1,β11,β12,β13,α2,α3,β21,β22,β23)=(0.1,0.6,0.3,0.4,−4,0.5,0.3,0.4,0.2). The censoring timeCwas generated from a uniform distributionU(0,γC), whereγCwas chosen to achieve the desired censoring proportion. Under this setting, we had 53% failures from cause 1% and 47% failures from cause 2 in the absence of censoring. We conducted 1000 simulations with sample sizes of 200 and 400.Table 2shows the true values, biases, and empirical coverage probabilities (CP) of 95% confidence intervals given in (3) for the difference of the 0.2th quantiles ofF1between two groups (Z1=0versusZ1=1) with common covariates (Z2=1andZ3=0.4), that is,τ=F1−1(0.2;Z1=0,Z2=1,Z3=0.4)−F1−1(0.2;Z1=1,Z2=1,Z3=0.4). The biases are small and the empirical coverage probabilities are close to the nominal level.We illustrate our quantile inference with early stage breast cancer data (Fyles et al., 2004). Between December 1992 and June 2000, 769 women with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive breast irradiation plus tamoxifen or tamoxifen alone. Of these 769 women, 641 were enrolled at the Princess Margaret hospital and 128 at the British Columbia Cancer Agency. Only 641 patients enrolled at the Princess Margaret hospital were used to this analysis: 321 patients in the tamoxifen alone arm (Tam) and 320 in the combined radiation and tamoxifen arm (RT + Tam). The median follow-up was 5.4 years. An event of interest was local relapse but some patients died from other causes prior to local relapse, yielding two competing events. The objective of this study was to investigate whether radiotherapy plus tamoxifen on local relapse is better than tamoxifen alone. Treatment (RT + Tam versus Tam), tumor size (median: 1.5 cm), and age at the time of randomization (median: 67 years old) were included as covariates.We fitted the cause-specific proportional hazards model for local relapse and for death without local relapse. Table 3shows the regression parameter estimates and standard errors for local relapse and for death without local relapse. Treatment and tumor size were significant for local relapse while age and tumor size were significant predictors of death without local relapse. Fig. 1shows estimates of the cumulative incidence with pointwise 95% confidence interval for local relapse and for death without local relapse under the cause-specific proportional hazards model for a woman aged 60 at the time of randomization of tumor size 2 cm on tamoxifen plus breast irradiation and tamoxifen alone. The rate of local relapse of the patient in the group given tamoxifen plus irradiation is lower than that in the tamoxifen alone group. However, the probability of dying of other causes prior to local relapse on tamoxifen plus irradiation is higher than that on tamoxifen alone. These results indicate that radiotherapy plus tamoxifen significantly reduces the risk of local relapse but has no effect on death without local relapse.Table 4shows estimates and 95% confidence intervals for quantiles of time to local relapse and time to non-local relapse death for the woman on tamoxifen plus irradiation and tamoxifen alone. In the group given tamoxifen plus irradiation, the 2% quantile of time to local relapse was 7.36 years and the 3% quantile of time to non-local relapse death was 2.51 years. However, in the tamoxifen alone group, the 2% quantile of the local relapse time was 0.84 year and the 3% quantile of the non-local relapse death time was 3.52 years. Thus, the quantile estimate of time to local relapse on tamoxifen plus irradiation is roughly nine times as large as that on tamoxifen alone, whereas the quantile estimate of time to non-local relapse death on tamoxifen plus irradiation is smaller than that on tamoxifen alone. This indicates that radiotherapy plus tamoxifen has a beneficial effect on local relapse but no effect on non-local relapse death, which confirms that radiotherapy plus tamoxifen is significant for local relapse but not for death without local relapse as shown in Table 3. For the difference of the 2% quantiles of the local relapse time between two treatment groups for the woman aged 60 years with tumor size of 2 cm (i.e.,τ=θ1(RT+Tam)(0.02)−θ1(Tam)(0.02)), the estimateτˆwas 6.52 and the corresponding 95% confidence interval was (6.04, 7.07).We investigated covariate-adjusted quantile inferences for competing risks data using the cause-specific hazards regression of the cumulative incidence function. The effects of covariates on the cause-specific hazard functions are assumed to satisfy proportional hazards models. We developed the construction of confidence intervals for quantiles of the cumulative incidence function given a value of covariates and for the difference of quantiles of the cumulative incidence functions between two treatment groups with common covariates by inverting a test statistic following Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982) and Su and Wei (1993). The simulation studies showed that the proposed inferences performed well.
