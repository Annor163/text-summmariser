@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In modern finite element analysis (FEA), a mesh is said to be ‘tangled’ if it contains one or more inverted elements. Tangling can occur, for example, during mesh optimization and mesh morphing. Modern finite element theory and commercial FEA packages are not designed to handle tangled meshes, i.e., they can lead to erroneous results. Researchers and practitioners therefore unanimously recommend untangling prior to analysis.In this paper, a new mathematical framework for FEA over tangled meshes is proposed. Specifically, by defining a cell decomposition of a tangled mesh, and an associated set of cell shape functions, it is shown that FEA can be successfully carried out over tangled meshes. The cell shape functions are constructed through an oriented linear combination of the classic element shape functions. Numerical examples illustrate the correctness of the proposed framework. Potential applications of the proposed framework are also illustrated.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In modern finite element analysis (FEA), the underlying mesh is required to satisfy numerous topological and geometrical properties [1–3]. For example, the mesh must: (1) be connected, (2) conform to the boundary, (3) be of ‘good quality’, and (4) not contain inverted elements, etc. In this paper, the primarily focus is on the last constraint.Fig. 1 illustrates an unacceptable mesh with one inverted element. In a later Section, we shall establish that the presence of an inverted element necessarily implies that the mesh must contain overlapping elements, i.e., the mesh must be tangled.Modern finite element theory and commercial FEA packages are not designed to handle tangled meshes, i.e., they can lead to erroneous results. This is confirmed later in this paper through a simple experiment using the commercial package ANSYS [4]. Researchers and practitioners therefore unanimously recommend untangling the mesh prior to analysis. For example, to quote [5]: “Because tangled meshes generate physically invalid solutions, it is imperative that such meshes [be] untangled”, and to quote [6]: “Since constitutive models for real materials are meaningful only for uninverted material, standard finite element simulation algorithms fail as soon as a single tetrahedron inverts …”Unfortunately, untangling is as difficult as mesh generation and optimization [7]. Indeed, as pointed in [6], none of these untangling methods are guaranteed to work, and “failure to untangle a single tetrahedron forces the simulation to fail for most real world constitutive model”. Therefore, a new extension to FEA is proposed in this paper; this extension provides the necessary framework for handling tangled meshes.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief literature review reveals the practical challenges posed by tangled meshes. Then, in Section 3, the mathematical ambiguity posed by tangled meshes is identified and isolated. Then, the notions of the cell decomposition and the cell shape function are introduced to resolve the ambiguity. Finally, a critical theorem for handling tangled meshes is established. In Section 4, a practical implementation for FEA over tangled meshes is discussed. This is followed by numerical experiments in Section 5. Conclusions and future work are addressed in Section 6.
