@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Supplier selection is a decision-making process to identify and evaluate suppliers for making contracts. Here, we use interval type-2 fuzzy values to show the decision makers’ preferences and also introduce a new formula to compute the distance between two interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The performance of the proposed distance formula in comparison with the normalized Hamming, normalized Hamming based on the Hausdorff metric, normalized Euclidean and the signed distances is evaluated. The results show that the signed distance has the same trend as our method, but the other three methods are not appropriate for interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Using this approach, we propose a hierarchical clustering-based method to solve a supplier selection problem and find the proximity of the suppliers. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, first a case study of supplier selection problem with 8 criteria and 8 suppliers are illustrated and next, an example taken from the literature is worked through. Then, to test the hierarchical clustering-based method and compare with the obtained results by two other methods, a comparative study using experimental analysis is designed. The results show that while the proposed hierarchical clustering algorithm provides acceptable results, it is also conveniently appropriate for using interval type-2 fuzzy sets and obtaining proximity of suppliers.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Supplier selection processes have gained due attention recently, since the costs of raw materials and component parts constitute the main cost of a product and most firms need to spend a considerable amount of their revenues on purchasing. Supplier selection is one of the most important decision making problems including both qualitative and quantitative factors to identify suppliers with the highest potential for meeting the needs consistently with acceptable costs. To meet customer's demand and to lessen internal cost and risk, companies select appropriate suppliers to offer more competitive products and distribute the products to customers in order to meet a variety of demands. Nonetheless, for a supply chain with a large number of suppliers, each supplier has its own product strategy with a corresponding level of competitiveness for the varying customer demands and preferences. If customer demand is not considered, then the produced products may be incompliant with customer expectations incurring great losses in the supply chain system [1].The term “supply chain management” defines management of a network of interconnected businesses involved with the provision of product and service packages required by the end customers in a supply chain [2]. Supply chain management spans all the movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, and finished goods from the point of origin to the point of consumption. To select suppliers, researchers have proposed various methods such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) [3], analytical hierarchy process (AHP) [4], fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) [5,6], analytic network process (ANP) [7], technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) [8], game theory [9], potential support vector machine (P-SVM) [10], preference programming (PP), fuzzy logic [11], fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) [12], simulated annealing [1], etc. Aissaoui et al. [13] gave a comprehensive literature review of the supplier selection and order lot-sizing modeling. The review covers the entire purchasing process, considers both parts and services outsourcing activities, and covers internet-based procurement environments. The review also classifies the published work. The literature is rich with quantitative models using mathematical programming to address the supplier selection problem with order allocation; e.g., linear programming [4], mixed integer programming [14] and mixed integer nonlinear programming [15]. Thanaraksakul and Phruksaphanrat [16] surveyed 76 papers on supplier selection in the purchasing literature and found that price, quality and delivery were the most commonly listed supplier evaluation dimensions. Che [17] stated that the selection of quality suppliers from a large pool of potential suppliers was a very important factor in supply chain decision-making. He proposed an optimization mathematical model and a heuristic method to evaluate suppliers in a multi-echelon supply chain system using cost, time, quality and environmental criteria. Khorasani and Khakzar [18] proposed a supplier selection model to select the best supplier of maize starch in a pharmacy company in Iran. To evaluate the suppliers, criteria such as price, quality, service, and technical issues were used. Punniyamoorthy et al. [19] made an attempt to develop a composite model for supplier selection using structural equation modeling and FAHP. The suppliers were evaluated based on criteria such as management and organization, quality, technical capability, production facilities and capacities, financial position, delivery, service, relationship, safety, environment concern and cost. Haq and Kannan [20] compared two supplier selection models of AHP and FAHP in a case study. In their study, quality, delivery, production capability, service, engineering/technical capability, business structure, and price were taken as decision criteria to propose the model for a rubber tube industry in India. Liao and Rittscher [21] used three evaluation criteria of cost, quality and delivery time for supplier selection. [22] proposed a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model for the selection of quality suppliers with respect to price, quality and time.Cluster analysis (CA) is a statistical method using a categorization algorithm to group a collection of datasets into clusters for easy manipulations. A cluster is therefore a collection of objects which are “similar” to one another and are “dissimilar” to the objects belonging to other clusters. Two types of clustering techniques can be distinguished as Partitional and Hierarchical techniques.Partitional clustering algorithms find all the clusters simultaneously as a partition of the data and divide a given data set into clusters so that each data point is in exactly one cluster. Given a data set of N data points, D=(x1, x2, …, xN), the task is to find K clusters, C=(π1, π2, …, πK), so that each data point is assigned to a unique cluster πK. The partitioning algorithms usually attempt to minimize or maximize a performance function (or objective function) defined for clustering and do not impose a hierarchical structure. K-Means [23], K-Means++ [24], K-Medoids, or Partition Around Medoids – PAM, [25], Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) [26], Soft K-Means [27], K-Harmonic Means (KHM) [28], Kernel K-Means [67] and Spectral [29,30] clustering algorithms are among the major standard clustering algorithms found in the literature.On the other hand, hierarchical clustering algorithms [31] find nested clusters. There are two types of hierarchical clustering algorithms. Divisive algorithm [25,32] is a top down clustering method, which starts with all the data points contained as one cluster and recursively divides each cluster into smaller clusters. Agglomerative algorithm [25,32] is a bottom up method of clustering, which starts with a single data point as its own cluster and merges the most similar pair of clusters successively till a final cluster containing all the data points is obtained. Some reason for a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm being used in our work here is as follows [31]:1.First, the proximity (dissimilarity) matrix is computed. The proximity matrix is an N×N matrix which defines the distances (or similarities) among all data points.Each data point represents a cluster.The closest (or most similar) two clusters are found and merged into one cluster.The proximity matrix is updated and the distances between the new cluster and each of the old clusters are computed.Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until all the data points lie in a single cluster of size N.Step 4 can be performed in various ways. These different ways lead to different hierarchical algorithms. Most hierarchical clustering algorithms differ only in their definition of distances (or similarities) between clusters. There are several ways to compute the distance between a group and a point. This equivalent distance can be done in more than one ways, i.e., either to take the minimum distance, the average distance or the maximum distance. If we choose single linkage clustering [25], we tend to choose the minimum distance. Average linkage clustering [32] chooses average distance within the cluster to some other point outside the cluster. Complete linkage [32] chooses the longest distance from any member of one cluster to any member of another cluster. A set of solutions is given if we are given a way to find distance and a way to relate group distance versus individual distance. A large number of hierarchical clustering algorithms exist in the literature, but they only differ in two respects, firstly, the way similarity coefficient or distance measure is calculated and secondly, single linkage, complete linkage or average linkage may be considered.Recently, cluster analysis is used as a suitable tool in handling the supplier selection problems. Hong et al. [33] applied a clustering technique to group customers which can then be used for supplier selection. Bottani and Rizzi [34] presented an integrated method, including CA and the AHP, to evaluate and rank the alternatives to select the suppliers. They pointed out that suppliers with similar characteristics could be clustered using CA to reduce supplier combinations. Fazel Zarandi and Gamasaee [35] developed an interval type-2 fuzzy order policy to determine orders in supply chain. They clustered the demand data of a real steel industry in Canada with an interval type-2 fuzzy c-regression clustering algorithm. Khaleie et al. [36] demonstrated the use of a clustering-based method to solve a group decision making problem. Intuitionistic fuzzy value was used to show the decision makers’ (DMs’) preferences and clustering method was utilized to cluster around the DMs’ preferences. Akman [37] selected suppliers involved in green supplier development programs and applied two-step supplier evaluation via fuzzy c-means clustering and evaluated suppliers using performance criteria and green criteria. After that, the VIKOR method [38,39] was used to sequence the suppliers.The main purpose of our work here is to present a suitable distance formula for interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2-FSs) with an application to decision making. In reality, group decision making has been found to have great significance and important applications. Our attitude or opinion is usually expressed with uncertain and indecisive statements. The word “good” is vague to the extent that the associated uncertainty or certainty, to say, is not the same for different people. Hence, if we have more than one DM, then type-1 fuzzy sets may not be appropriate. Since the group members are expected to have different senses of linguistic variables to express their preferences, usage of type-2 fuzzy values for the data is deemed to be useful.Our proposed distance method here is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique, using average linkage clustering to deal with the supply chain. The aforementioned method based on IT2-FSs is used to select high-ranked suppliers providing the most customer satisfaction for the specified criteria. In practice, as reliance on a single selected supplier may not always be guaranteed (due to some unexpected circumstance at the time of contract with the first supplier), selection of only one supplier is not reasonable. By using this clustering method, we can find the proximity of the suppliers in addition to the ordering ranking. In other words, this method can determine how far or close the successive high ranked suppliers are. Hence, considering a cluster of suppliers seems to be more practical. Having this in mind, we intend to develop a fuzzy model using linguistic values.The remainder of our work is organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief review on fuzzy distances are given and a new distance method for IT2-FSs is proposed and relevant properties are explained. In Section 3, the proposed distance is compared with 3 other methods including normalized Hamming distance, normalized Hamming distance based on Hausdorff metric, normalized Euclidean distance and signed distance. In Section 4, an algorithm is presented for the selection of the supplier based on the IT2-FSs. In Section 5, there are a case study, an example from literature and an experimental analysis to illustrate the applicability and the reasonability of the proposed hierarchical clustering-based method. Finally, we conclude in Section 6.For some theoretical and practical problems, we need to numerically express the difference of two objects (notions) by means of distance between the corresponding fuzzy sets. Distance measures have attracted attention due to their diverse applications in various areas such as remote sensing, data mining, pattern recognition and multivariate data analysis. A distance describes the discrepancy between two fuzzy concepts. Many researchers have conducted extensive studies on distance measures for IT2-FSs. A number of distance measures for precise numbers have been established in the literature. However, a logical problem arises when the distance is computed in an imprecise framework due to the inherent vagueness. Burillo and Bustince [40] defined the normalized Hamming and the normalized Euclidean distances, only involving two parameters, the membership degree and the non-membership degree in describing an IFS. Atanassov [41] suggested a direct generalization of the Hamming and Euclidean distances used in classical set theory for intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval valued fuzzy sets. Kehagias and Konstantinidou [42] introduced the concept of L-fuzzy valued inclusion measure and investigated the relationships among the L-fuzzy valued inclusion measure, the L-fuzzy similarity measure, and the L-fuzzy distance. Hung and Yang [43] proposed a method to compute the distance between intuitionistic fuzzy sets on the basis of the Hausdorff distance. Grzegorzewski [44] gave a definition of the interval-valued fuzzy set distance based on the Hausdorff metric. Chen [45] presented a signed distance-based method to handle fuzzy multiple-criteria group decision-making problems in which individual assessments were provided as generalized interval-valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and the information about criterion weights were not precisely but partially known.Here, an alternative distance measure between two IT2-FSs is proposed and its metric properties are studied. Then, an algorithm making effective use of the proposed distance is presented. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed distance formula is compared with the normalized Hamming [46], normalized Hamming based on Hausdorff metric [46], normalized Euclidean [46] and the signed distances [45].In many real applications such as multi-criteria decision making, the objects/alternatives are often evaluated with respect to different attributes/criteria. Hence, we need to take all the aspects into account. In addition, weighting of different criteria is quite important and needs to be considered. In a decision making process, it is convenient for DMs to provide their knowledge by using linguistic terms, as being close to human's cognitive process. To manage such knowledge with uncertainty, the fuzzy linguistic approach using fuzzy set theory was proposed by Zadeh [47] to model the linguistic information. The linguistic variable, defined as “a variable whose associating values are not numbers but words or sentences in a natural or artificial language”, enhances the flexibility and applicability of the decision models and provides practically good results in various areas [48]. When the alternatives with respect to different criteria are represented by IT2-FSs, we need to compute the distance among IT2-FSs in order to compare the considered alternatives.By the measures described in Section 2.1, the distance is obtained based mainly on certain points, e.g., midpoints or endpoints on the intervals of IT2-FSs, which unavoidably turn into loss of information and even ineffectiveness of the distance measures in some cases. To overcome this inadequacy, since the surface of FOUs is embedded with several type-1 fuzzy sets, the proposed distance measure uses these type-1 fuzzy sets in addition to the endpoints of the FOUs. Hence, we are going to define a new distance formula by making use of the information regarding all the points over the interval of the given IT2-FS, to deter the drawback due to the information loss. The basic definitions, commonly being used in interval type-2 fuzzy set theory, are given in Appendix A.Assume two IT2-FSs,A˜andB˜,and the corresponding embedded type-1 fuzzy sets Aeand Be(see Fig. 1). The proposed distance betweenA˜andB˜is defined as follows:(1)d(A˜,B˜)=|ζ(A˜)−ζ(B˜)|=∑∀Ae∫01xμAe(x)dx∫01μAe(x)dx×∫01xμAe(x)dμAe(x)∫01μAe(x)dx∑∀Ae∫01xμAe(x)dμAe(x)∫01μAe(x)dx−∑∀Be∫01xμBe(x)dx∫01μBe(x)dx×∫01xμBe(x)dμBe(x)∫01μBe(x)dx∑∀Be∫01xμBe(x)dμBe(x)∫01μBe(x)dx.Next, we give an algorithm for computing the distance on the basis of (1).The algorithm assumes n embedded type-1 fuzzy numbersA˜eandB˜e.The firstA˜e(B˜e) is UMFA (UMFB), the next one is UMFA+(LMFA−UMFA)/(n−1) (UMFB+(LMFB−UMFB)/(n−1)), and after n iterations, the last one is LMFA (LMFB). By increasing n, the surface of FOUs is embedded with more type-1 fuzzy sets. Hence, the value of n has a direct impact on the difference between the upper and lower membership functions for the IT2-FS. In other words, when the difference between the upper and lower membership functions increases, the value of n should also increase.Fig. 1 shows two interval type-2 fuzzy sets with trapezoidal (the left side of the figure) and Gaussian (the right side of the figure) membership functions. The corresponding low and high membership functions and discrete embedded type-1 fuzzy sets are shown as solid lines and dashed lines, respectively. In this figure, the number of embedded type-1 fuzzy sets, n, is typically assumed to be 9. In practice, in order to obtain the embedded T1-FSs (A˜eandB˜e) via Algorithm 1, large numbers for n, e.g., 10, 20, … are used.Algorithm 1Find distance between two IT2-FSsStep 1: Give the upper and the lower membership functions forA˜(UMFA and LMFA, respectively) andB˜(UMFB and LMFB, respectively), and the number of embedded type-1 fuzzy sets (n).Step 2: Set the initialNumeratorA1,DenominatorA1,NumeratorB1andDenominatorB1to zero, the first Aeto UMFA, the first Beto UMFB and the iteration number i to 1.Step 3: Calculate the difference between two successive embedded type-1 fuzzy sets, ΔA=(LMFA−UMFA)/(n−1) and ΔB=(LMFB−UMFB)/(n−1).Step 4: Calculate the termsd1A=∫01xμAe(x)dx∫01μAe(x)dx,d2A=∫01xμAe(x)dμAe(x)∫01μAe(x)dx,d1B=∫01xμBe(x)dx∫01μBe(x)dxandd2B=∫01xμBe(x)dμBe(x)∫01μBe(x)dxappearing in Eq. (1).Step 5: SetNumeratorA1=NumeratorA1+(d1A×d2A),DenominatorA1=DenominatorA1+d2A,NumeratorB1=NumeratorB1+(d1B×d2B)andDenominatorB1=DenominatorB1+d2B.Step 6: If i<n then change the values of Aeand Beto Ae+ΔAand Be+ΔB, respectively, set i to i+1, and go to Step 4.Step 7: Calculate the distance between two IT2-FSs,A˜andB˜,asdistance=NumeratorA1DenaminotorA1−NumeratorB1DenaminotorB2and Stop.Definition 1A real function d is called a metric distance, if d has the following properties [49]:i.d(A˜,B˜)≥0,for any two IT2-FSs,A˜andB˜.d(A˜,B˜)=d(B˜,A˜),for any two IT2-FSs,A˜andB˜.d(A˜,B˜)+d(B˜,C˜)≥d(A˜,C˜),for any three IT2-FSs,A˜,B˜andC˜.Next, we show that our proposed distance formula is indeed metric.Theorem 1The proposed distance formula (1) is a metric distance.See Appendix B.Let three interval type-2 fuzzy setsA˜,B˜andC˜be defined in the universe of discourse X. We write if and only ifd(A˜,B˜)<d(A˜,C˜),meaning thatB˜is closer toA˜thanC˜.Here, the performance of the use of the proposed distance formula is compared with the results due to the formulas of normalized Hamming [46], normalized Euclidean [46], the normalized Hamming distance based on Hausdorff metric [46] and signed [45], as described below.For two interval type-2 fuzzy setsA˜andB˜,Zhang et al. [46] obtained the following formulas for the normalized Hamming distance (dH), the normalized Euclidean distance (dE) and the normalized Hamming distance based on Hausdorff metric (dHH) [46]:dH(A˜,B˜)=12n∑i=1n(|μ¯A˜(xi)−μ¯B˜(xi)|+|μ_A˜(xi)−μ_B˜(xi)|),dE(A˜,B˜)=12n∑i=1n((μ¯A˜(xi)−μ¯B˜(xi))2+(μ_A˜(xi)−μ_B˜(xi))2),dHH(A˜,B˜)=1n∑i=1n(max(|μ¯A˜(xi)−μ¯B˜(xi)|,|μ_A˜(xi)−μ_B˜(xi)|)).These are straightforward generalizations of distances used in the classical set, obtained by replacing the characteristic functions of the classical sets with the membership functions of the interval type-2 fuzzy sets.Chen [45] also presented a signed distance and a method based on it for handling fuzzy multiple-criteria group decision-making problems in which individual assessments were provided as interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. ConsideringA˜as an interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy number defined in the universe of discourse X=[0, 1],A˜=[AL,AU]=[(a1L,a2L,a3L,a4L;hA˜L),(a1U,a2U,a3U,a4U;hA˜U)],where,0<a1l≤a2l≤a3l≤a4l≤1,0<a1u≤a2u≤a3u≤a4u≤1and0<hA˜L≤hA˜U≤1.The signed distance (dSD) ofA˜from1˜was defined to bedSD(A˜,1˜)=18a1L+a2L+a3L+a4L+4a1U+2a2U+2a3U+4a4U+3(a2U+a3U−a1U−a4U)hA˜LhA˜U−16.Considering the above signed distance, the distance between two interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbersA˜andB˜is calculated as follows:dSD(A˜,B˜)=|dSD(A˜,1˜)−dSD(B˜,1˜)|.To compare the performance of the proposed distance with the normalized Hamming distance, normalized Euclidean distance, normalized Hamming distance based on Hausdorff metric and signed distance, the 32 word FOUs (Fig. 2) were used, with the UMF and LMF values as in Table 1[50].The ranking of these 32 word FOUs is already presented by Wu and Mendel [50], using the centroid-based method. Assuming that the ranking order of 32 word FOUs (Table 1) is valid, considering Definition 2, we compare the performance of the proposed distance with the other four. It should be noted, in order to make the interval type-2 fuzzy sets (shown in Table 1) compatible for use in the signed distance, the interval type-2 fuzzy sets were normalized and used in all computations.Based on the Definition 2, for example, the distance between “None to very little” and “Teeny-weeny” should be smaller than the distance between “None to very little” and “A smidgen”. Hence, the distances between the first word FOU (None to very little) with the other 31 word FOUs should be in increasing order.As seen in Table 2and Fig. 3, only the results corresponding to our proposed distance formula and the signed distance show increasing orders. Due to formulations of both the methods, it is obvious that the signed distance designed for interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy sets and therefore is not applicable for all kinds of interval type-2 fuzzy sets, while our proposed method is.Calculated distances between the first element, “None to very little”, and elements 7 and 14, “A bit” and “Moderate amount”, with the normalized Hamming, normalized Hamming based on Hausdorff metric and normalized Euclidean distances are:dH(e1,e7)=0.4955,dH(e1,e14)=0.3344,dHH(e1,e7)=0.6151,dHH(e1,e14)=0.5704,dE(e1,e7)=0.5819,dE(e1,e14)=0.5035.These are in contradiction with Definition 2, because e7<e14 but dH(e1, e7)>dH(e1, e14), dHH(e1, e7)>dHH(e1, e14) and dE(e1, e7)>dE(e1, e14).As seen in Fig. 3, neglecting the above mentioned limitation of the signed distance, the results obtained by this method has the same trend as our method, but it seems that three other methods are not appropriate for interval type-2 fuzzy sets.In this section, an algorithm for supplier selection with hierarchical clustering of suppliers based on the proposed distance formula is explained. First, we present definitions of centroid and centroid based ranking method for IT2-FSs used in our work.Definition 3[50]The centroidC(A˜)of an IT2-FSA˜is the union of the centroid of all its embedded type-1 fuzzy sets (T1-FSs) Ae, that is,C(A˜)≡⋃∀Aec(Ae)=[cl(A˜),cr(A˜)]where ∪ is the union operator, andc(Ae)=∑i=1NxiμAe(xi)/∑i=1NμAe(xi).It has been shown thatcl(A˜)andcr(A˜)can be expressed as:(2)cl(A˜)=∑i=1Lxiμ¯A˜(xi)+∑i=L+1Nxiμ_A˜(xi)∑i=1Lμ¯A˜(xi)+∑i=L+1Nμ_A˜(xi)(3)cr(A˜)=∑i=1Rxiμ_A˜(xi)+∑i=R+1Nxiμ¯A˜(xi)∑i=1Rμ_A˜(xi)+∑i=R+1Nμ¯A˜(xi)The switch points L and R, as well ascl(A˜)andcr(A˜),are computed by the iterative Karnik and Mendel (KM) algorithm [51].First compute the average centroid for each IT2-FSA˜ias(4)c(A˜i)=cl(A˜i)+cr(A˜i)2,i=1,2,…,N,and then sortc(A˜i)to obtain the rank ofA˜i.Due to the variety of quantitative and qualitative criteria affecting a decision-making process, supplier selection is deemed to be a complex and risky problem. It consists of three phases: (i) defining qualitative and quantitative criteria to screen an initial list of suppliers, (ii) determining the criteria weights and ranking of suppliers for selecting qualified suppliers and (iii) allocating order quantity to qualified suppliers [52,53].In order to prevent interruption in the supply of raw materials, more than one supplier is generally considered [7,12,35]. However, there are some cases in which selection of only one supplier is preferred [5,6,36,54]. If a company desires to select one supplier (best supplier), then our proposed clustering process can find the best supplier as well as determine the proximity or remoteness of the highly ranked suppliers. As a result, in unforeseen circumstances problems at contract times, knowing the proximity of highly ranked suppliers can help in determining a proper solution. Also, when the company prefers to select more than one supplier, for example to create a more competitive market, or when there is a capacity constraint on suppliers, then clustering of suppliers and ranking of clusters can help in making a strategic decision.Here, an algorithm for a hierarchical clustering of suppliers and their ranking based on a proposed distance formula by attention to average linkage clustering is explained.Algorithm 2Hierarchical clustering and ranking of suppliersAssume a company with material demand of md in the production line, which should be supplied by appropriate suppliers and assume K decision makers (DM1, DM2, …, DMK), N criteria (C1, C2, …, CN) and M alternatives/suppliers (S1, S2, …, SM) with corresponding available capacities (δ1, δ2, …, δM). We intend to cluster M suppliers in hierarchical classes and rank the resulting clusters.•Step 1: Clustering.-Step 1-1: For each DM, choose the linguistic ratings or IT2-FS of the ith alternative with respect to the jth criterion(x˜ijk,i=1,2,…,M,j=1,2,…,N,k=1,2,…,K),K tables of size M×N, and the appropriate linguistic variables(w˜j,j=1,2,…,N)as weights of the jth criterion.Step 1-2: Determine the weights of DMs. Assume that the decision group contains K DMs. The importance of the DMs is considered as linguistic terms expressed in IT2-FS. Let(Γ˜k,k=1,2,…,K)be an IT2-FS for rating of the kth DM. Then, the weight of the kth DM, ωk, is computed to beωk=c(Γ˜k)∑k=1Kc(Γ˜k)wherec(Γ˜k)is calculated by (4), ωk>0 and∑k=1Kωk=1.Step 1-3: Aggregate the opinion of DMs as follows:x˜ij=∑k=1Kωkx˜ijk,w˜j=∑k=1Kωkw˜jk,i=1,…,Mandj=1,…,Nwhere ωkis the weight of the kth DM,x˜ijkis its corresponding preference andw˜jkis the weight of jth criterion by kth DM.Step 1-4: Determine the weighted interval type-2 fuzzy decision matrixR˜=[r˜ij]M×Nas follows:R=[rij]M×N=x˜11⊗w˜1x˜12⊗w˜2…x˜1N⊗w˜Nx˜21⊗w˜1x˜22⊗w˜2…x˜2N⊗w˜N⋮⋮⋱⋮x˜M1⊗w˜1x˜M2⊗w˜2…x˜MN⊗w˜NStep 1-5: Set M clusters {S1}, {S2}, …, {SM}, with each cluster containing exactly one supplier, and set η=M, where η is a variable corresponding to the number of clusters.Step 1-6: Compute the distance matrixD=[δjj′]N×Nfor {S1}, {S2}, …, {SM}, using predetermined n embedded type-1 fuzzy sets (see Algorithm 1) as follows:δii′=d({Si},{Si′})=∑j=1N(−1)λj×ζ(r˜ij)−∑j=1N(−1)λj×ζ(r˜i′j),i=1,2,…,M,i′=1,2,…,M,withλj=0,ifCjisabenefitcriterion,1,ifCjisacostcriterion,and ζ(.) calculated by (1).Step 1-7: Choose a minimal entry of the matrix D. In other words, find {Sα} and {Sβ} such thatδαβ=min∀i∀j(δij),and then merge {Sα} and {Sβ} in a single cluster labeled by {Sα, Sβ}.Step 1-8: Eliminate the rows and columns corresponding to clusters {Sα} and {Sβ}, add a row and a column giving the distance between the cluster {Sα, Sβ} and the remaining clusters. Then, update the number of clusters as η=η−1 and the matrix D using predetermined n embedded type-1 fuzzy sets (see Algorithm 1) as follows:d({Si},{Sα,Sβ})=∑j=1N(−1)λj×ζ(r˜ij)−∑j=1N(−1)λj×ζ(r˜αj)+ζ(r˜βj)2,i=1,2,…,M,where ζ(.) calculated by (1) andλj=0,ifCjisabenefitcriterion,1,ifCjisacostcriterion,Determine the distance between two clusters {Sα, Sβ} and{Sα′,Sβ′}as:d({Sα,Sβ},{Sα′,Sβ′})=∑j=1N(−1)λj×ζ(r˜αj)+ζ(r˜βj)2−∑j=1N(−1)λj×ζ(r˜α′j)+ζ(r˜β′j)2.Step 1-9: If η>1 then go to step 1-7.Step 2: Ranking of clusters.-Step 2-1: Obtain the centroid value for each cluster as follows:c({Si})=∑j=1N(−1)λj×c(r˜ij),i=1,2,…,M,wherec(r˜ij)calculated by (4) andλj=0,ifCjisabenefit criterion,1,ifCjisacostcriterion,Step 2-2: Rank the clusters at each level based on the centroid values, in decreasing order.Step 3: Supplier selection.-Step 3-1: Set ℓ=0.Step 3-2: Calculate the available capacity of the high-ranked cluster at level ℓ,δ′ℓ, asδ′ℓ=∑k∈Cℓ1δk,whereCℓ1is the best cluster at level ℓStep 3-3: Ifδ′ℓ<mdthen ℓ=ℓ+1 and go to Step 3-2.Step 3-4: Set ℓ as the optimum level and select the suppliers at the high-ranked cluster at this level as the best suppliers and Stop.Note: The proposed algorithm has applications in two cases of supplier selection problems. In the first case, if there is no supplier capacity constraint, and the company desires to select only one supplier, then the supplier selection is made based on level 0. The clustering of suppliers in this case shows the closeness of the top two suppliers. In reality, when a company enters into a contract with a supplier, unforeseen problems may occur. Therefore, it is important to know the difference of the top two suppliers. If the top two suppliers join in a cluster at a high level, then it means that there exists a large difference. So, the company should somehow try to resolve the unforeseen contract problems and be close to the best supplier. Otherwise, if the two top suppliers join in a cluster at a low level, it means that there is a small low difference between them. So, if the company could not have a contract with the first ranked supplier, the company can select the second ranked supplier and have a contract bearing small loss.In the second case, if there is supplier capacity constraint or for strategic decisions, the company would like to select more than one supplier, then by attending to material demand and capacity of suppliers, the optimum level and hence the best cluster is selected. Therefore, the company can enter to contracts with suppliers present in the selected cluster.The first step in a supplier selection is to establish the criteria. Different companies have different specific requirements concerning vendor evaluation. In our study, we use appropriate criteria for the requirements as follows:•Quality: Supplier should provide materials conforming to the requirement set by the firm. Each manufacturer has its own special quality standards to be considered by the supplier. To control, each manufacturer seeks her own quality control policies. This criterion has been used by several researchers; see Khorasani and Khakzar [18] and Pitchipoo et al. [55].Total cost: The emphasis shifts away from the traditional, standard cost of the purchased materials toward the total cost of the part. Other costs, in addition to the standard material cost, need to be considered. Ordering, transportation, packaging, carrying inventory costs and the potential for price reduction are other elements of the total cost. It may be that the supplier with the lowest standard cost may not have the lowest total cost due to the high rework, scrap or transportation cost. This criterion has been used by several researchers; see Lee [56] and Bharadwaj [57].Technological capabilities: Due to technological advances, quality of material has improved and material production term has shortened. Technological capabilities contribute to product development and improve supplier's ability. This criterion was used by some researchers such as Punniyamoorthy et al. [19] and Haq and Kannan [20].Buyer–supplier partnerships: A buyer–supplier partnership, allowing the buyers to spend less time on launching and expediting and more time on flexibility management, contract negotiation, packaging and transportation aspects of the procurement process, should be formed in the supplier selection decision. This criterion has been used by some researchers such as Guneri and Kuzu [54].Geographic location: In choosing the most appropriate supplier, buyer should assess the length of the supply chain as well as the strength of the supplier's commitment for on-time delivery services. This criterion was used by Barla [58].Flexibility: The supplier must be able to adjust to the changing demands as necessary. This criterion has been used by Barla [58].Production performance: Suppliers’ past business practices must be considered by DMs as a way of predicting how things may progress. This criterion has been used by researchers such as Guneri and Kuzu [54].On-time delivery: The supplier should maintain the delivery schedule determined by the firm. In choosing the most appropriate supplier, buyer should assess the length of the supply chain as well as the strength of the supplier's commitment for on-time delivery services, which include follow up or expediting services. Ting [59] used this criterion.Our case study concerns a medium-sized company in Iran, manufacturer of cellular light weight concrete and cement based products. The key raw material in the production line is cement with the amount of 300tons/day, which should be supplied by appropriate suppliers. After consultations, 8 suppliers out of more than 57 suppliers were determined to be suitable in the marketplace. Table 3shows the available capacities of these suppliers.A committee of three experts was formed to rate the importance of criteria and to rate suppliers with respect to each criterion by linguistic terms. In our study, five different levels were used for linguistic terms. We used IT2-FSs to translate linguistic terms into fuzzy numbers. The importance levels of the criteria are given in Table 4.Applying Algorithm 2, the procedure for selecting the supplier is given below.•Step 1: clustering.-Three DMs use the linguistic variables shown in Table 4 to rate the importance of the criteria; the results are shown in Table 5. They also use Table 4 to rate suppliers with respect to each criterion; the results of the ratings are shown in Table 6.In this study, the importance of the DMs is considered to be the same. Hence, a DM's weight is set to be 1/3.The DMs’ opinions were aggregated and the upper and the lower membership functions of the criteria weights are shown in Table 7. Then, the weighted interval type-2 fuzzy decision matrix was calculated as shown in Table 8.Eight clusters {S1}, {S2}, {S3}, {S4}, {S5}, {S6}, {S7} and {S8}, each containing exactly one supplier, are set.The distance matrices for {S1}, {S2}, {S3}, {S4}, {S5}, {S6}, {S7} and {S8} are computed and the results are shown in Table 9. The minimum value in Table 9 is 0.0344 and so we merge clusters {S7} and {S8} and label it as {S7, S8}.The row and column corresponding to clusters {S7} and {S8} are eliminated and a row and a column giving the distance between the cluster S6. and the remaining clusters are added.Since the number of clusters is 7 (>1), transfer is made to step 1-7 in Algorithm 2.Completing the execution of the algorithm, the results are shown in Tables 9–15. The bold elements show the minimal values leading to merging of the corresponding clusters.Fig. 4shows the hierarchical clustering of suppliers in 7 levels.Step 2: Ranking of clusters.At each level, the centroids of clusters are calculated as shown in Table 16. Considering Table 16, ranking of the clusters at each level are shown in Table 17. Each cluster at each level is coded asCℓ1,ℓ2,where ℓ1 is the level number and ℓ2 is the cluster number.Step 3: Supplier selection.In this case, the suppliers have capacity constraint and the material demand is 300tons/day (md=300). By attention to step 3 in Algorithm 2, the available capacity of the best cluster at level 2 is 350,δ′ℓ=350,and soδ′ℓ>mdand therefore, the algorithm stops at level 2 as the optimum level. The best cluster at level 2 is {S1, S3}. This means that the company can enter into contract with S1 and S3. Here, for more explanations, the available capacity of the best cluster for each level is calculated and shown in Table 18.For more discussion on step 3 of Algorithm 2, assume the supplier capacity constraint is not considered and the company would like to select only one supplier. In this case, according to Algorithm 2, the procedure ends at level 0. The ranking of clusters/suppliers at this level is S3>S1>S5>S4>S6>S2>S8>S7, and the best supplier is S3. Since S3 merges with S1 into a cluster at level 2, it means that S3 and S1 (top two suppliers) are slightly different with each other. In reality, it is important to know how much the best suppliers distinguish. In this example, since the difference between S3 and S1 is smaller as compared to that of S3 and other suppliers, if one could not close the deal with S3, then S1 may be chosen with a small loss.Now, assume that the ranking result is S6>S8>S7>S2>S4>S5>S1>S3, and the hierarchical clustering result is similar to that shown in Fig. 4. At level 1, S7 and S8 merge together and then at level 4, S2 joins them and at level 6, S6 joins {S2, S7, S8}. This means that there is a large difference between S6 and S8, and so if we could not close the deal with S6, then we have S8 with a substantial loss. Therefore, in practice, we should somehow try to resolve the unforeseen contract problems and be close to S6.Here, an example from Wang et al. [60] is used to show that Algorithm 2 produces the same results as AHP [61], TOPSIS [62], Chen's [64] and Wang et al.’s [60] methods, and additionally not only is appropriate for interval type-2 fuzzy sets, but also provides clusters of suppliers (alternatives) as signs of closeness of suppliers and ranking of clusters.According to Wang et al. [60], three decision-makers (D1, D2, D3) plan to select the best building from X, Y, Z as their office, where the selection criteria are size, transportation, condition and finance. These three decision-makers respectively compare the four criteria and evaluate their degrees of satisfaction with the buildings. After performing the procedures of evaluating grades, aggregating, weighting and normalizing, the weighted normalized fuzzy preference matrix is shown in Table 19.The distance matrix for the three clusters (suppliers) is computed based on step 1-6 and the results are shown in Table 20. As seen, the minimum distance (bold) is obtained between clusters {X} and {Z}, and thus these two clusters join. In the next step, {Y} joins the cluster {X, Z}. The resulting hierarchical clustering is shown in Fig. 5.Table 21shows similar results for the cluster ordering based on center of clusters as Y>Z>X as well as the obtained ranking orders of Chen's [64], AHP [61], TOPSIS [62] and Wang et al.’s [60] methods.There are a variety of methods for solving decision making problems. Different ranking orders could be obtained on the same information (evaluation) by using different methods.To test the algorithms and compare the results obtained by different methods, randomly generated problems are used to calculate the so-called contradiction rates as defined in [63]. Generally, three kinds of contradiction rates are recorded for each case by running each case with several random replications. The first contradiction rate, named as R1, is defined as the rate at which the fuzzy WSM [63] and another fuzzy method disagree in the indication of the best alternative. The second contradiction rate, R2, is defined as the rate at which the fuzzy WSM [63] and another fuzzy method disagree on the entire ranking of the alternatives. The last one is named as R3 and is defined as the rate at which a method changes the indication of the best alternative when a non-optimal alternative is replaced by a worse alternative.To compare the solution results obtained by the proposed method with the ones by two other methods [64,65], we wrote a MATLAB (R2013a) computer program to generate random data and to solve fuzzy decision making problems with all possible combinations of 3, 5, 7, …, 21 alternatives and 3, 5, 7, …, 21 criteria. Hence, 100 (10×10) different instances were examined in this study. For each instance, 1000 different fuzzy decision matrices D were randomly produced. Therefore, 100,000 (100×1000) sets of experimental cases were generated. As in Triantaphyllou and Lin [63], we first generated m (alternatives) by n (criteria) matrix with uniformly generated numbers between 1 and 9, using the MATLAB function, random. We then rounded the components of the matrix, using the MATLAB function, round. Finally, each component aijof the rounded matrix was turned into a triangular fuzzy number(a⌢ij,aij,a⌣ij),wherea⌢ij=0.5,ifaij=1,aij−1,ifaij>1,anda⌣ij=9,ifaij=9,aij+1,ifaij<9,as suggested by the Saaty scale [66].The proposed method, the method of Chen [64] and the IT2-FSs method proposed by Chen and Lee [65], were tasted using the randomly generated matrices on a 2.00-GHz laptop with 1.00 GB of RAM. Resulting plots of contradiction rates R1 and R2 vs. number of criteria for different number of alternatives are shown in Fig. 6. As seen, calculated contradiction rates R1 and R2 for our proposed method are smaller than those obtained for the other two methods.The plots of contradiction rate R3 vs. number of criteria for four different numbers of alternatives are shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen, contradiction rate R3 for all methods are very similar, and additionally, a decreasing profile is observed by increasing the number of criteria.Despite the increasing inaccuracy of these fuzzy methods, when the decision-making problems become more complex, it can be seen from these graphs that our proposed method is better than the other two fuzzy decision-making methods in most cases. This means that the proposed method is as efficient as the other methods. Additionally, besides the ability in ranking suppliers, our method provides the clusters of suppliers at different levels, as an indication of closeness of the suppliers and also ranks of the clusters. Another advantage of the proposed method over other methods is its appropriateness for interval type-2 fuzzy sets.
