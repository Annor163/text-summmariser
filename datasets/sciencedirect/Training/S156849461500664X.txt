@&#ABSTRACT@&#
With the advent of paralleling and implementation of restructuring in the power market, some routine rules and patterns of traditional market should be accomplished in a way different from the past. To this end, the unit commitment (UC) scheduling that has once been aimed at minimizing operating costs in an integrated power market, is metamorphosed to profit based unit commitment (PBUC) by adopting a new schema, in which generation companies (GENCOs) have a common tendency to maximize their own profit. In this paper, a novel optimization technique called imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) as well as an improved version of this evolutionary algorithm are employed for solving the PBUC problem. Moreover, traditional binary approach of coding of initial solutions is replaced with an improved integer based coding method in order to reduce computational complexity and subsequently ameliorate convergence procedure of the proposed method. Then, a sub-ICA algorithm is proposed to obtain optimal generation power of thermal units. Simulation results validate effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method on two scenarios: (a) a set of unimodal and multimodal standard benchmark functions, (b) two GENCOs consist of 10 and 100 generating units.fuel consumption coefficient of unit (i)fuel consumption coefficient of unit (i)fuel consumption coefficient of unit (i)cost of imperialist (n)cost of country (n)cost function of unit i ($); for units with ON status, (Ci(P(i,t))=ai+bi*P(i,t)+ci*P(i,t)2normalized cost of nth imperialistcold start-up cost of unit i ($/h)cooling constant of unit i (h)ramp down rate of unit i (MW/h)cost of best obtained solution at last iteration of algorithmhot start-up cost of unit i ($/h)initial state of unit i (h)commitment state of unit i at time tnumber of decades of main/sub algorithmtotal number of generating unitsnumber of coloniesnumber of imperialistsinitial number of colonies of empire na chaotic vector produced by a chose maptotal system demand at time t (MW/h)positions of a colony at the current decadepositions of an imperialist at the current decadepositions of a colony at the next decademaximum active generation of unit i (MW/h)maximum response rate limited active power output of unit i at time tminimum active generation of unit i (MW/h)maximum response rate limited active power output of unit i at time tgeneration of unit i at time t (MW/h)a randomly generated number within [0,1]total revenue ($)start-up cost of unit i at time t ($)stopping criterion of the algorithm, when it converges into 10−6 tolerancedispatch period (h)total cost of generation ($)total cost of imperialist empire nminimum OFF time of unit i (h)minimum ON time of unit i (h)ramp up rate of unit i (MW/h)a vector that is directed toward the imperialist locations and starts from the previous location of the colony |{v1}|=1a vector perpendicular to vector V1time duration for which unit i has been OFF at time t (h)time duration for which unit i has been ON at time t (h)colonies’ corporation factor in imperialist’ powera chaotic number between zero and one generated by a specific mapping methodassimilation weight factordeviation limit from the original directionprosperity value of empire iforecasted market price for energy at time t ($/MWh)probability of imperialist i

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Adopting an optimal thermal unit commitment (UC) scheduling that is compatible with the power system operators’ goals is a remarkable obligation in power system R&D. In economic operation of an electricity power market, a proper generation scheduling of thermal units is of elemental importance. An accurate and sagely proposal for solving the UC problem can provide economic savings as well as high efficiency operation conditions for generation system. In an integrated power market, a cost based UC was referred to the scheduling of thermal generating resources to satisfy the daily load demand simultaneous with satisfying system and units’ constrains comprising maximum/minimum capacity of units, minimum up/down time, ramping up/down and reserve constraint; in order to minimize the total operating costs.To this end, various types of classic methods (e.g. branch and bound (B&B) [1], Lagrangian relaxation (LR) [2], mixed integer programing (MIP) [3] and priority list (PL) [4]) besides the heuristic and evolutionary algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithm (GA) [5–7], partial swarm optimization (PSO) [8], simulated annealing (SA) [9], imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) [10] and bacterial foraging (BF) [11], invasive weed optimization Algorithm (IWOA) [12], artificial bee colony (ABC) [13], ant colony optimization (ACO) [14], Tabu search (TS) [15]) have utilized to handle complexity of mixed integer problem of UC and provide an optimal solution regarding to the scale of generating system.In order to achieve high-quality solutions, these techniques can effectively overcome complex nonlinear constraints; but, all of the classic mentioned methods suffer from defects caused by extreme extension of dimensions [16]. In [17] a novel straightforward method (SFM) is presented by the authors; in which, UC problem has decomposed into three sub-problems based on the theory of linearization of quadratic cost functions of generating units. In order to overcome deficiencies of deterministic methods or to improve characteristics of an algorithm, some hybrid algorithm (e.g. EP & LR [18], GA & LR [19], PSO & LR [20], PL & ant colony optimization (ACO) [21], ACO & lambda iteration (LI) method [22], EP & PSO [23], GA & PL [24], LR & ACO [25], improved pre-prepared power demand (IPPD) & Muller [26]) have been proposed for UC problem.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After providing some explanations about motivations of PBUC problem in Section 1.1, Section 2 discusses the techniques for solving PBUC problem. Section 3 states formulation of problem, while Section 4 provides details of proposed methodology. Section 5 proposes sketch of algorithm codification and constrain handling to solve the optimization problem. Performance of proposed technique is illustrated in Section 6 via case studies. Concluding remarks are presented in Section 7.Prior to the wave of restructuring throughout the world, regional monopolies supplied electricity that were owned power plants, transmission lines and distribution systems. Some sorts of regulations were utilized to adjust the ratio of profit returning to the utilities in deregulated countries. Until the 1990s, due to either political atmosphere (as in the United Kingdom) or high expense of electricity (as in the U.S.) as the result of unparalleled traditional utilities, there was no real stress for the creation of a “restructured generation market”. However, with aim of gaining possibility to enlarge their profits through a speculative market, generators decided to support deregulation of the electricity market. The interaction between created market rules and the prevalent market structure of the industry determines whether economically efficient prices can be set by these markets.Moreover, it seems that number of active and assiduous participants in a competitive electricity market plays a considerable role on the success of the restructuring procedure [27]. In the Nordic countries, number of players in the market is crucial issue in order to improve efficiency of market which is total objective of deregulation. To this end, in [28], it is proposed that at least five or six competing generating companies (GENCOs) is a perquisite for achieving lower prices in a restructured electricity market.With the establishment of generation companies as a consequence of deregulation of electricity market and approval of modified generation rules in the renovated environment, maximization of profit obtained from selling of the power and ancillary services production is regarded as the ultimate goal of the newfangled companies; in which, regardless of any societal benefits and operating policy of Independent Operator of System (ISO), the satisfaction of load demand constraint is relaxed [29]. In such the environment, profit based unit commitment (PBUC) as a complex optimization problem has achieved noticeable attention of power market researchers.In a similar procedure as the traditional cost-based UC problem, several classic methods like LR [29,30], which are mostly afflicted with numerical convergence incompetence due to using Lagrangian multipliers [32], and MIP [30,31] techniques are used for the UC problem in a competitive environment with the intention of obtaining an optimal solution. However, the marvelous capability of the evolutionary techniques for global search in a complex search space subject to system and unit constraints of PBUC problem, as well as their ability to offer high performance computing by means of high-speed parallel processing systems containing several powerful central processing units (CPUs), have encouraged researchers to apply these algorithms for PBUC problem (e.g. TS [33], Muller method [34], GA [35], nodal ACO (NACO) [36], parallel PSO in a shared memory model (PPSO) [37], IPPD table [26], ABC [38] and parallel nodal ant colony optimization (PNACO) [39]) in the recent years.At the same time, some of authors begin to combine classic and heuristic methods to effectively metamorphose characteristics of traditional methods (e.g. LR & EP [41], LR & GA [42] and LR & PSO [43], LR&PSO [44]), hoping either to achieve more adaptive techniques that have the capability of diminishing the convergence difficulties of Lagrangian relaxation by using penalty factor methods or to streamline complicated coding methods of variables.The main contributions of this paper compared to the previous studies can be summarized as follows:•Employing ICA as well as an improved version of this algorithm called “ICA combined with chaos” as main solver of PBUC.Using an integer coded algorithm [6] and conforming this codification to PUBC objective function.Proposing a sub-ICA algorithm cascaded with main algorithm to determine optimal generating power of units.Proposing knowledge based concept in order to cut down number of integer variables that represent ON/OFF status of generating units.The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated on two scenarios and the best obtained results are compared with those of the previously presented methodologies.Recently, numerous researches have been accomplished in order to achieve a solution optimal for UC problem aiming at either minimizing generation costs or to maximize system social welfare. Among different approaches employed for solving UC problem, some of them are conventional techniques in which resulted solutions are mostly optimal. However, it takes a lot of memory and takes a lot of time in getting an optimal solution. On the other side, there are heuristics (non-deterministic methods) that are based on experience for solving, learning, and discovery that find solutions which are not guaranteed to be optimal, but good enough for a given set of goals. In fact, these methods are used to speed up the finding process of impractical exhaustive search based approaches.Third class is belonged to the hybrid methods that are either combination of two algorithms from one category or two algorithms from different categories. In this regard, some techniques have focused on speed and others on accuracy. However, there is always a trade-off among parameters in different techniques to minimize the total cost or to maximize the profit. These methods are classified in Table 1.In contrast to the traditional unit commitment in an integrated power market that formed to meet load demand at the minimum operating cost, maximization of day-ahead total profit of GENCOs is regarded to be the ultimate goal of PBUC problem in the restructured power industry. To this end, PBUC problem has turned into a prominent obligation in a short period of time. Mathematical formulation of this problem can be represented as follows [29].The objective function of PBUC problem is given by:(1)Maximize Profit=RV−TCHere:(2)RV=∑t=1T∑i=1N[ρgm(t).Pi,t.I(i,t)](3)TC=∑t=1T∑i=1N[Ci(P(i,t).I(i,t))+ST(i).I(i,t).[1−I(i,t−1)]]Where in this paper, start-up costs are modeled as a two-valued (hot start/cold start) staircase function [5] as follows:(4)STi,t=HSCi,ifXi,toff≤CSTi+T(i)offCSCi,ifXi,toff>CSTi+T(i)offThe PBUC problem is formulated subject to the following system and unit constraints [29].System Constraints1.Demand constraint(5)∑i=1NP(i,t).I(i,t)≤PD(t)t=1,…,TIn this paper an approach to schedule active power is presented while GENCO will not participate in the ancillary service market.Unit Constraints1.Unit Generation Limits(6)P(i)Gmin≤P(i,t)I(i,t)≤P(i)GmaxUnit Minimum ON/OFF Durations(7)[X(i,t−1)on−T(i)on]∗[I(i,t−1)−I(i,t)]≥0(8)[X(i,t−1)off−T(i)off]∗[I(i,t)−I(i,t−1)]≥0Unit Ramping Constraints(9)P(i,t)−P(i,t−1)≤UR(i)as unitiramps up(10)P(i,t−1)−P(i,t)≤DR(i)as unitiramps downIt should be noted that (6), (9) and (10) can be combined as follows [6]:(11)P(i,t)Max=min[P(i)Gmax,P(i,t−1)+UR(i)]as unitiramps up(12)P(i,t)Min=max[P(i)Gmin,P(i,t−1)−DR(i)]asunitirampsThe Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is a global search optimization algorithm inspired by the imperialistic competition [45]. As similar to other meta-heuristics, ICA starts with creation of initial population comprising countries which are counterpart of Particles in PSO or Chromosomes in GA. These 1×Nvar dimension arrays are defined by:countries=[x1,x2,…,xNvar].In the next stage, a cost based categorization of initial countries should be implemented in which more elite counties (that enjoy lower costs) act as the imperialists and others will participate as their colonies. The cost of initial individual solutions can be evaluated using objective function (13).(13)Cost=f(country)=f([x1,x2,…,xNvar])The first group that enjoys the best scores are regarded as elite countries and will be chosen to be the imperialists; whereas, the remained countries will be their colonies. At the next step, all the colonies will be apportioned among the imperialists according to power of each imperialist's. For this purpose, the normalized cost of an imperialist is defined by:(14)Cn=cn−maxi{ci}i=1,…,NimpIn this regard, the more powerful imperialists may posse more colonies. Then, the normalized power of each imperialist that determines the number of initial colonies related to the each imperialist is given by:(15)pn=Cn∑i=1NimpCiConsidering the normalized power of an imperialist, the number of initial colonies that an imperialist should possess can be calculated by:(16)N.C.n=round{pn.Ncol}Now, this is high time that imperialist associated with its colonies formed an empire. In algorithm procedure, policy is that colonies should start to metamorphose some parts of their cultural characteristics in order to assimilate toward their relevant imperialist. This process (i.e. named Assimilation) is carried out by moving the colonies towards their relevant imperialist in the solution space. The new position of the assimilated colony, after the movement of colony toward the imperialist with a random angle θ, can be calculated by:(17)PosCd+1=PosCd+βPosId−PosCd×ri×tan(θ)After accomplishment of assimilating operator, as similar as the mutation policy in GA, an additional operator named Revolution is applied to enforce assimilated solutions to not involve in local optima. During these processes, it is not unlikely that a colony reaches a position better than its imperialist in terms of power. By occurrence of this event, this colony will conquer position of its imperialist and it is required for other colonies of this empire to move toward new more powerful imperialist at the coming decade. Then, it is time for the empires to participate in an imperialist competition; in which, more powerful empires tend to conquer colonies that are under the possession of weaker empires. In this contest, power of every imperialist depends not only on the costs of it, but also to a ratio of colonies’ cost.(18)T.C.n=Cost(imprialistn)+ξ.mean{Cost(coloniesofempiren)}In optimization terminology, such a policy assists more optimal solutions (powerful empires) to attract weaker solutions toward the global optimum solution of the problem. For this purpose, the normalized total cost of an empire is defined by:(19)N.T.C.n=T.C.n−maxi{T.C.i}The probability of each empire to possess the weakest colonies of the weakest empires is given by:(20)ρˆn=N.T.C.n∑i=1NimpN.T.C.iAs given in (20), each empire has its own prosperity to conquer the weakest colony of the weakest empire, in order to enlarge its empire's domain. In this regard, needless to say, empires that enjoy more assets will gain higher qualifications to satisfy their gluttony.(21)μrn=ρˆn−rn,n=1,…,Nimpμrn=[ρˆ1−r1,ρˆ2−r2,…,ρˆNimp−rNimp]A uniform distribution is used for generating random numbers within [0,1]. This contest among the empires leads the weaker empires (local optimum solutions) to be collapsed; while, it is an assistance for the most powerful imperialist (optimum solution of the problem) to survive and make all the other countries as colonies of its own universal empire. This competition among the empires is depicted in Fig. 1.Outline of classical ICA is presented in Fig. 2.In recent years, various types of improved ICA have introduced by researchers. To this end, an improved ICA has been proposed in [46]; in which, an improvement has involved in the assimilation policy and movement process of the original algorithm, such that a point out of the colony-imperialistic contacting line can be obtained.Such the revised version of assimilation policy is indicated in Fig. 3.In this algorithm, in addition to exchange of the angle θ by an orthogonal colony-imperialistic contacting line (since is named orthogonal imperialist competitive algorithm (OICA)), different random values have been used to deviate colonies from their direct movement toward the imperialist:(22)PosCd+1=PosCd+β.(PosId−PosCd).{rand(0,1)}⊗{V1}+U(−1,+1).(PosId−PosCd).tan(θ){V2},{V1}.{V2}=0In this algorithm, a random value U (−1, +1) is used for the third term of Eq. (22) that has ability of simultaneous changing of direction and values in order to cross the point provided by the two first terms.Recently, chaos has gained significant interest in the case of optimization theories due to its inherent tangent connect to the nonlinear systems [47]. Chaos theory based optimization algorithms that enjoy remarkably different stochastic search methodologies than by the existing computation methods and evolutionary swarm intelligences, utilize chaotic variables instead of random variables to ameliorate the performance of search engines. These algorithms that are called chaotic optimization algorithms (COA) have capability of global search at notable superior speeds than stochastic searches because of employing a turbulent generation method [48]. Three different chaotic maps are investigated to recognize the adaptive one for PBUC problemSome of the well-known one-dimensional maps for generating chaotic numbers are as follows:Sinusoidal chaotic map (SCM)This mapping method [49] is represented by:(23)xn+1=axn2sin(πxn)For a=2.3 and x0=0.7, which has a simplified form, this map is defined by:(24)xn+1=sin(πxn)ICMIC chaotic map (ICM)Chaos sequences production using the Iterative Chaotic Map with Infinite Collapses (ICMIC) is represented by:(25)xn+1=sinkxnDiversion parameter k is considered as a value within (0, ∞) [50].Logistic chaotic map (LCM)Logistic map which is also known as a demographic model is extracted from the chaotic behavior of a biological population. This map is a of degree two, polynomial mapping that results chaos [51]. This map is represented by:(26)xn+1=hxn(1−xn)Utilizing experimental results, 4 is an appropriate value for parameter h.In this section, the authors use COA in initialization procedure as well as in the assimilation policy of ICA. For the algorithms utilize uniform random initialization, escaping from local optimums leads algorithm to reach some undesirable or mostly unacceptable solutions; while, execution of the chaos in hybrid COA-ICA provides a more comprehensive initialization in domain of search surface. Likewise, the random movement of colonies toward their relevant imperialists (i.e. Eq. (17)) during the assimilation policy of ICA is replaced with a chaotic motion; in which, random values are not generated by the uniform distribution. In this way, solution space around the imperialist will be explored more precisely. A simple classification of the new chaos based ICA (CICA) algorithms can be as follows:CICA 1For this approach, assimilation policy of ICA (i.e. Eq. (22)) is refined by replacement of the vector {rand (0, 1)} with a vector generated by an optional chaotic map (OCM) which is stated in the previous section. This modification is given by:(27)PosCd+1=PosCd+β.(PosId−PosCd).{OCM}⊗{V1}+U(−1,+1).(PosId−PosCd).tan(θ).{V2},{V1}.{V2}=0CICA 2For this approach, the assimilation policy of ICA (i.e. Eq. (22)) is refined by replacement of the vector U (−1, +1) with a vector generated by an OCM. This modification is given by:(28)PosCd+1=PosCd+β.(PosId−PosCd).{rand(0,1)}⊗{V1}+{OCM}.(PosId−PosCd).tan(θ).{V2},{V1}.{V2}=0CICA 3For this approach, the represented approaches CICA1 and CICA1 are simultaneously employed; in which {rand (0, 1)} and U (−1,+1) are replaced with the turbulent values.(29)PosCd+1=PosCd+β.(PosId−PosCd).{OCM}⊗{V1}+{OCM}.(PosId−PosCd).tan(θ).{V2},{V1}.{V2}=0In this research, a novel modified coding of the initial countries based on combination of the method presented in [6] and a sequential sub-ICA, with the goal of eliminating binary bits representing On/Off status of generating units and conversion of them to discrete variables, is proposed. In this approach, status of each unit during commitment scheduling horizon have been stated by certain numbers of integer; so that, positive and negative integers represent the ON and OFF cycles of units, respectively. The operation duration of unit i at the first cycle of scheduling is given as follows:(30)T1i=+Rand(max(0,T(i)on−T0i),T),ifT0i>0−Rand(max(0,T(i)off+T0i),T),ifT0i<0This equation satisfies minimum up/down time constraints of the problem as well as that of the last cycle of the previous scheduling day. Considering the minimum ON/OFF time constraints of units, the duration of cth cycle of the operation of unit i is given as follows:IfTc−1i<0, duration of the cth cycle represents the ON state of unit:(31)Tci=+Rand(T(i)on,RTc−1i),if(RTc−1i)>T(i)on+RTc−1i,otherwiseIfTc−1i>0, duration of the cth cycle represents the OFF state of unit:(32)Tci=+Rand(T(i)off,RTc−1i),if(RTc−1i)>T(i)off+RTc−1i,otherwisewhereRTc−1irefers to the remained scheduling time after appropriation of the first c−1 cycles and can be calculated as follows:(33)RTc−1i=T−∑p=1c−1TpiAfter determination of the initial population (i.e. countries in ICA terminology), the unit minimum up and down-time constraints are automatically satisfied. An illustration of such the codification is depicted in Table 2.By execution of the assimilation and revolution policies, the updated variables of position of colonies are obtained which may violate minimum up and down-time constraints or may not to be integer. Therefore, the Round function is applied to the updated position of countries.(34)NewPosCd+1=Round(PosCd+1)In order to satisfy the minimum Up/Down time constraint and maintain scheduling time interval (i.e. consider to be 24h), an outline, as indicated in Fig. 4, is executed.At the next step, as opposed to UC scheduling [6] that uses economic dispatch (ED) to determine the optimal generating power of each unit, as depicted in Fig. 5, a sub-ICA program (i.e. a second independent ICA algorithm) should be implemented corresponding to each of integer coded solutions subject to demand constraint (5), unit generation limits (6), unit ramping constraints (11) and (12); while, main ICA is subjected to unit minimum ON/OFF durations (7) and (8). The sub-ICA program utilizes the same scheme as the main algorithm. The penalized cost function presented in this paper is adapted to objective of PBUC (1)–(3), and subjected to the demand constraint (5) adopted by GENCO in the restructured power market. Toward this end the penalty function is defined as:(35)ψ=ϖ.∑t=1Tmax1PD(t).ℜ∑i=1NPi,tMin.Ii,t−PD(t),0whereℜ.is the unit ramp function and ϖ is a multiple of the maximum operating cost of system over the scheduling period and is defined as follows:(36)ϖ=Ω.T.∑i=1NCi(Pi,tMax)where Ω is a positive integer. The overall objective of proposed methodology is to minimize the cost of solutions during iterations of the sub-ICA. The cost function is defined as follows:(37)CountryCost=−(RV−TC)+ψIn this study, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the presented method, two scenarios have been presented. For first scenario, authors employed numbers of standard test functions; while, proposed method has been employed to obtain optimum scheduling table for medium-scale (10 unit system) and large-scale (100 unit system) GENCOs in second scenario. The proposed heuristic algorithm is implemented on Intel® Core™ i5-460M Processor (3M Cache, 2.53GHz) using MATLAB software, version 8.0.0.783.Scenario 1: for this scenario, proposed method has been applied to a set of challengeable unimodal (F1–F4) and multimodal (F5–F8) standard benchmark functions. These functions have been detailed in Table 3. The proposed algorithm has been run for 50 times. Maximum iteration number has been set to 5000 in case of unimodal and 10,000 in case of multimodal benchmark functions. Maximum function evaluations number of proposed method can be calculated as follows:(38)MaxNFE=Ndmain×Ndsub×(Nimp+Ncol)×2where value 2 in this equation is due to inherent structure of ICA.11During any iteration (i.e. decade in ICA terminology) of execution procedure of traditional ICA, cost function is evaluated for two times.In order to guaranty a fair comparison of different algorithms and to avoid utilizing execution time as a comparison index (because different qualities of codification for a same problem formulation can result in different execution times), maximum number of function evaluations is considered as stop criterion of algorithms’ implementation. For all algorithms, maximum number of function evaluations has been set to that of proposed algorithm.Multimodal functions include two functions with a few local minima (F5 and F6 depicted by Fig. 6) and two functions with many local minima (F7 and F8 depicted by Fig. 7). In order to reach solutions of multimodal functions, hybrid niching-ICA method proposed by [40] with some sorts of conformations to presented chaos based ICA has been employed.For aforementioned benchmark functions, stop criterion of simulation is defined as follows:(39)fend.it(country)−globalmin≤StCNumber of successful runs of algorithm (i.e. reached StC criterion) using ICA and CICA for F1 and F2 are shown in Table 4. As it can be deduced from Table 4, the best result is obtained using the CICA3-Logistic map.Comparison of best solution obtained of traditional ICA and CICA 3-Logistic map for given test functions F1–F4, with other algorithms are shown in Table 5.Mean and standard deviation for results obtained are calculated as follows:(40)Std.dev=1n∑i=1n(xi−x¯)21/2where xiis vector of solutions resulted by runs of program andx¯is mean value of solutions:(41)x¯=1n∑i=1nxiAs it can be illustrated from Table 5, proposed methodology can be highly effective for optimization task in comparison with other algorithms. As it can be illustrated from Table 5, best and worst performances are related to CICA3 – LCM and TS, respectively; while PABC and ICA show relatively equal performances and also weaker performances compared to the CICA3 – LCM. Obviously, proposed version of ICA has been improved efficiency of traditional ICA in cases of reaching global solution and lower standard deviations.Besides, it can be seen that PNACO has a performance almost as similar as PABC and ICA for most of benchmark functions. In case of max (worst) solution, proposed algorithm has shown its excellence in comparison task for all benchmark functions. Although, PPSO has a better performance than TS, obtained solutions by executions of this algorithm have not enough quality to be comparable with other algorithms. In sum, in case of single objective functions, superiority of CICA3 – LCM to other algorithms for providing more quality solutions and as well as higher convergence is evident.The comparison of niching-ICA (CICA3 – LCM) and other algorithms based on success times (number of runs in which all global peaks have been found), mean (average final value of all runs of algorithm) and average number of optima found (the average number of peaks found over 50 runs with StC=1×10−3) is detailed in Table 6. As it can be seen, maximum success times are obtained by CICA3 – LCM. Needless to say, multimodal functions are more challengeable than unimodal functions. Subsequently, success rates for multimodal functions are highly lower than unimodal functions. About functions F5-F8 (i.e. multimodal functions), PNACO and PABC have better performances than ICA in most of cases.It is noteworthy, with the increment of complexity of benchmark functions from F5 to F8, quality of solutions reached are reduced. As an illustration, average optima found by CICA3 – LCM for function F5 is 2 where there are two global peaks (i.e. 100% success); while, about F8, there are 18 global peaks and best average optima found is 15.11 by CICA3 – LCM (i.e. 83.9% success). Such the statement is correct about success times and mean values as well. Results provided by PPSO and TS implementations show none of them are capable of comparing with other algorithms. However, PNACO has approximately equal performances to CICA3-LCM about functions F5 and F6, superiorities of proposed codification of ICA are obvious in cases of benchmark functions F7 and F8 where complexities of test functions are increased.Considering the significant dependence of the convergence of heuristic algorithms on initial parameters, optimal parameters of algorithm for proposed main and sub-ICAs are obtained through several runs of the program. These values are detailed in Table 7.Scenario 2: for this scenario, in order to assess the quality of proposed technique for an applied problem, two GENCOs consist of 10 and 100 generating units are utilized as the test system for a 24-h scheduling period. Single line diagram of the IEEE 39 bus system is shown in Fig. 8.Proposed ICA based techniques have been executed in order to reach an optimal methodology for solving PBUC problem. Forecasted load demand and energy price in spot market are detailed in Table 8[41]. The parameters of units for 10-unit GENCO are provided in Table 9[41]. For the 100-generating unit system, the data of 10 unit generating system and the load data are multiplied by 10. Optimal parameters of algorithm are detailed in Table 10.The best result of simulations after 50 independent runs of PBUC for each case using ICA and CICA are shown in Table 11. The stop criterion of the algorithm is either to reach the max number of decades or one imperialist remains after the imperialist competition. As it is indicated in Table 11, the best profit is obtained using the CICA3-Logistic map.Optimum power schedule corresponding to the best solution of CICA 3-Logistic map for given 10 unit system and commitment status of 100 unit system are shown in Tables 12 and 13.Hourly operation costs and profits for 10-unit system are shown Table 14. Comparison of the best profit obtained from different methods is shown in Table 15. Results confirm the advantages of proposed methodology compared with the pioneer methods.Considering the fact that dispatchers know the number of daily ON/OFF cycles of generating units from their operating history; and based on the data acquired from historical operation report and daily load profile of the test systems, estimation of the optimum number of integers corresponding to the commitment status of units (i.e. maximum number of state transitions of generating units) is determined to be 5 in [6] for the UC problem. Therefore, a 5×NGbit representation is adopted for the units’ status.In this research, in order to enhance the convergence speed of algorithm as well as reducing the complexity of problem to reach more optimal solutions, this value is diminished utilizing a novel expert person knowledge based concept in which a 3×NGinteger bit coding represents commitment statue of units over the 24-h scheduling horizon. As it is depicted in Fig. 9, as opposed to the UC problem in which the minimum number of ON/OFF transitions of generating units is limited by the number of load peaks during the UC horizon, despite a high load demand during the second peak, due to low price of energy in the spot market, the second peak of load is shaved.Graphical illustrations of units’ status depicted in Figs. 10 and 11show no unit experiences more than three transitions during the PBUC scheduling horizon. The reason for such the reduction is that the large units that have larger minimum up/down time are used for the base loads. Moreover, these units are faced with the scheduling horizon limitations for second transition; while, smaller units that have high cost of generation due to slop of generation curve, cannot conquer trade-off of cost and benefit when the energy price is low. Comparing Figs. 10 and 11 with that of the previous contributions represented in literature review validates the proposed reduction in case of numbers of initial solutions.Considering optimum solutions resulted from several runs of program, it can be deduced that fewer number of countries utilizing proposed novel codification can result as same as greater number of countries with traditional codification. Number of initial solutions for second scenario using traditional and modified methods of solutions coding are shown in Table 16.As it can be deduced from the results presented in Tables 16 and 17, the CICA is faster than traditional ICA due to lower number of initial solutions; while, proposed reduction can significantly ameliorate algorithm performance in case of beating local optimums. Besides, authors proposed a modified codification of the initial countries by which 10×24 bit and 100×24 bit coding of initial solutions (i.e. referring ON/OFF status of units) turned into a 5×10 and 5×100 bit codification, respectively. As the result, computational time of algorithm has significantly been reduced. Authors added a new table in which computational cost of algorithm has been compared with that of using traditional coding.
