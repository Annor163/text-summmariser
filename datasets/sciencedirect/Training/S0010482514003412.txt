@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The low-weight newborns and especially the premature infants have difficulty in maintaining their temperature in the range considered to be normal. Several studies revealed the importance of thermal environment and moisture to increase the survival rate of newborns. This work models the process of heat exchange and energy balance in premature newborns during the first hours of life in a closed incubator. In addition, a control problem was proposed and solved in order to maintain thermal stability of premature newborns to increase their rate of survival and weight. For this purpose, we propose an algorithm to control the temperature inside the incubator. It takes into account the measurements of the body temperature of a premature newborn which are recorded continuously. We show that using this model the temperature of a premature newborn inside the incubator can be kept in a thermal stability range.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The stability of the body temperature is the result of heat production and heat loss. Newborns and especially premature creatures are easier to cool than later on in life. A good environmental thermal management is a key role in their care and survival (cf. [1]).This manuscript aims at determining the proper thermal environment for premature infants under incubator treatment. Therefore we proposed the following objectives: (a) to model the process of heat exchange and energy balance during the first hours of life in incubation, (b) to set up and solve a control problem, for the environmental temperature surrounding the child, in order to keep the body temperature in a range that increases their survival rate and weight.Modelling the process of heat generation and thermal energy transport in the body׳s neonates nursed in convectively heated incubators is a complex process that involves the blood circulation and the balance between metabolic heat production and body heat dissipation through conduction, evaporation, convection, radiation and evaporative heat losses. The complexity of incorporating the effect of blood circulation in the transfer of heat in the body is due to the variable flow, and counter-current effects between veins and arteries.In the literature there are some models that attempt to incorporate the architecture of the vascular system. However, they are more complex and when put in practice provide similar results as the model proposed earlier by Pennes in 1948 [2]. Pennes׳ model describes the heat transfer in the human forearm and he was the first to quantify the contribution of blood circulation to the heat transfer in biological tissue. In [3] the validity of the Pennes model is discussed because it does not incorporate the counterflow effects between veins and arteries. Nevertheless, in practice it is most widely used for its simplicity. Ludwig [4] proposes a more complex model to describe the heat transfer in newborns in incubators. In his model he considers that the thermal characteristics of tissues depend on spatial variables. Other interesting proposals came from Werner [5] and Wissler [6], who divide the body into compartments: head, neck, thoracic cavity and extremities. They propose equations for each compartment and the interaction between adjacent compartments.This paper tackles the issue with a different approach. We propose a compartment model that describes heat transfer in premature infants inside an incubator. Unlike the models proposed in [5,6] our model neither divides the body into sections nor considers in explicit form the role of the spatial variable, but divides it into three layers: deep tissue, surface tissue or skin and blood. The model incorporates mechanisms of heat generation/loss and heat exchange with the surrounding environment. The main reason for this proposal is based on the following: First in the human body there are organs that produce more heat than others such as the ones located in the thoracic and the abdominal cavity that produce 56% of the total heat in the body and the brain gives off 16% of the total heat (cf. [7]), some parts release heat like the lungs and through the skin. The flow of heat goes from the first organs to the second ones and it is transported mainly by convection throughout the blood circulation and the heat cannot be transferred by conduction due to the low conductivity rate of the tissues (cf. [7,8]). On the other hand the irregular geometrical shape of the body leads to a complicated spatial field of temperatures in which we can highlight isotherms, in other words regions of equal temperature. According to the measured data of the isotherms obtained by Aschoff and Wever [9] they could identify a body periphery belonging to the skin and the extremities and whose temperature in the parts change according to the temperature in the environment and core homoeothermal by the body and head. A gradient of temperature is established between the internal and the external region of the body and for this reason it can be considered that there are two layers of the body that are the Core or also known as Kernel layer and the other known as the Surface layer. These two factors, the low conductivity rate of the tissues and the two layers which we have seen, show us not to include spatial variable in our model. Obviously this goes on the detriment as the role of the blood is to supply the heat through a convective process within the organism. Due to that we consider the blood to be a intermediate agent that transfers heat from the Core to the body Surface. The core temperature can be estimated through the temperature in the armpit, the surface temperature is estimated through the temperature in the sole of the foot, these two kinds of temperature are used as diagnostic temperatures to determine the thermal stability of the premature newborns. The thermal stability is the range of the body temperature in which the newborn has the lowest metabolic waste. The existence of these diagnostic temperatures that are taken in specific areas in the human body can be justified as an average of temperatures in different regions of the periphery and the core. Due to this we have confirmed again that the spatial variable can be omitted in the model. According to the above in the model that we are proposing we will consider the average variations of the temperature in the core, the peripherals, and the blood. Also using this model we will propose and solve a problem that gives us an algorithm to optimize and monitor the thermal environment in an incubator that is convectively heated as stated in the introduction of [19], which even to this day continues to be a challenge.Several studies have revealed the importance of the thermal environment and humidity to increase the rate of survival of sick, low weight or premature newborns. From the published literature useful information can be extracted to determine whether a newborn is in thermal stability. Thermal stability is understood as the state in which the baby maintains the temperature of the deep structures of his body (central or core temperature) between 36.8 and 37.3°C, using only the smallest possible amount of heat generated by metabolic reactions. Furthermore, the difference between the central temperature (TK) and the temperature of the extremities of the body or peripheral (TS) must be less than1°C(cf. [1,10]).In general, the methods for monitoring the core temperature are invasive, so the core temperature is approximated by the armpit temperature and the peripheral temperature is approximated by the temperature at sole [10,11].In order to increase the survival rate and growth of the premature infants, it is important to maintain the temperature inside the incubator (Ta) in a range known as neutral thermal environment (NTE) [12]. That is the range of the temperature inside the incubator in which the baby is in thermal stability. The tables to approximate the NTE consider factors such as the weight of the baby and the chronological age in the case of premature newborns; see, for instance, [13–15]. It is important to remark that the NTE tables were obtained experimentally and they are used by doctors in hospitals. In our model, we assume that a premature newborn is inside of a closed incubator, lying on a heated mattress that has a constant temperature (Tm) and the conductive exchange coefficient of the fabricated material is0.05Wm2/°Cwhich corresponds to a material mentioned in [16]. In our model the mattress is expected to have a constant temperature of 30°C unlike what is proposed in [16] where the mattress has a constant temperature of 36°C. The walls of the incubator are simple and made of Plexiglass, which are maintained at an average temperatureTrusing two infrared lamps, located on top of the incubator. We assume that the Plexiglass is opaque to the wavelengths emitted by the lamps, because of that the effect of direct radiation from lamps is not considered as a variable. On the other hand, the coefficient of transference of heat by radiation of the Plexiglass is too low (4×10−7Wm2/°C, see [17]) due to this it is possible to omit the exchange of heat between the walls and the air flow around the child. Furthermore the coefficient of the emissivity of Plexiglass is very high, due to that, the radiative heat loss of the newborn is calculated. That loss is derived byσϵskεrA(TS4−Tr4)according to the estimations proposed by [18].Trhas been calculated from the method known as view factor exhibited by [19].The interior of the incubator is maintained at an average temperatureTathrough pre-heated air from a furnace.The average temperatureTrof the incubator walls and the average air temperatureTainside it are the result of the variation in the intensity of the lamps and the power of the incoming air heater, among other factors. Note that the air speed has spatial and temporal variation in the interior of the incubator, but the temporal variation of the temperature is not considered because we assume that there is a control mechanism (the description of this mechanism is not within the scope of this work) which kept air velocity ranges stable inside the incubator during the time that simulations were carried out. Furthermore, the air flow over the body of the baby is laminar and thus has little variation. Also the body of the baby is small and the velocity values are low (cf. [21]). These features allow us to ignore the spatial variation of the velocity and consider it as an average value measured 10cm above the center of the mattress, according to the recommendations of the American National Standards, 1997 [20]. The temperature within the incubator is also measured at the same point.In this manuscript, we assume thatTaandTrare the control parameters in the model.The incubator has three temperature sensors that are located inside. Two of the sensors monitor the baby׳s temperature, one is located in the armpit the other one in the sole of the foot. The third sensor monitors the average air temperature inside the incubator. There are five more sensors located inside and on the walls that estimate the temperatureTr.Before formulating the model we will review the physiological mechanisms of generation and distribution of heat and the influence of the environment temperature.We assume that the body of the baby consists of two layers: Core or Kernel (K) and surface (S). The Core includes tissue, bones and internal organs, while the surface consists of fat and skin. We define two layers because through the skin heat exchange with the environment is performed and, although the fat layer is thin, it has thermal properties different from those of the core.The main source of heat in the body of a premature newborn is the basal metabolism and the most important mechanism of heat distribution is the blood circulation. We assume that the basal metabolism is generated uniformly in layer K. Besides heat sources we consider the evaporative losses through respiration and skin. We assume that the heat loss through respiration only occurs in K, while the water losses that occur by skin permeation only involve layer S. There are other physiological mechanisms (vasomotor processes, tremor, exercise, food intake, sweat) in the human body that are not considered in the model because their contribution on the temperature variation is negligible or because the premature newborn is not able to do so.The body temperature is also influenced by physical mechanisms of heat loss or gain that usually occur through the thermal exchange within the skin. These mechanisms are present only in the S-layer and they are the following: (i) Conduction: describes the heat exchange through a portion of the child׳s body that makes contact with the mattress. (ii) Convection: describes the exchange of heat between the body and the air circulating around inside the incubator. (iii) Radiation: describes the effect of heat exchange between the body of the baby and the walls of the incubator. Any of these three processes can generate heat losses or gains. The other mechanism is (iv) Evaporation: describes the insensible water loss from the skin. We need to highlight that the proposed model can be applied to describe the evolution and stabilize the core body temperature in a situation where are known certain anthropometric and physiological characteristics, gestational age and during a certain time interval. To show the results of this manuscript we have considered the following characteristics of the premature newborn: the weight 1.2kg, 1 or 2 days old and with an average oxygen consumption of3.9ml/kgmin.We set a period of time[ti,tf], withti,tf∈[0,+∞)andti<tf. We suppose that, in the absence of control, the surrounded environment inside the incubator is at a fixed temperatureTa(all the temperatures considered here are given in degree Celsius). The procedure by which it can be reached that temperature value depends on how the input of hot air into the incubator is controlled and is not an objective of this work.We assume that the core temperature (TK) and the surface temperature (TS) are functions that depend only on time. We assume that the blood circulates through K and S without distinguishing between arterial and venous blood and we denote byTbthe average blood temperature. We propose a model with three equations. The first one describes the variation of temperature in the core (TK), the second one describes the variation of temperature in the surface (TS), and the third one describes the variation of average blood temperature (Tb), without considering some blood effects as the distribution mechanism and the flow effects between veins and arteries. We suppose that the blood acts as a third compartment whose function is that of a mediating agent in the heat exchange between the core and the surface.Under these considerations, we propose a model of ordinary differential equations that represent an energy balance. Each equation represents the following:Left-hand side: It is the rate of accumulation of thermal energy per unit volume due to the change of temperature in the tissue or blood.Right-hand side: Here we have the heat sources and heat losses. As sources we consider the rate of heat transfer per unit volume due to contact between layers, blood circulation and metabolic reactions. Among the terms that produce heat losses we include heat transfer rates per unit volume due to respiration, conducting, convection, radiation and evaporation. The low conductivity of the tissues which we have seen leads us not to include the process of heat exchange between Core and Surface layers.The terms above may or may not appear in the equations depending on the physiology of each layer. The resulting equations are the following:(1a)ρKϖKdTK(t)dt=CbK(Tb(t)−TK(t))+αoOo(t)−(cR1−CR2Ta(t))in(ti,tf),(1b)ρbϖbdTb(t)dt=CbK(TK(t)−Tb(t))+CbS(TS(t)−Tb(t))in(ti,tf),(1c)ρSϖSdTS(t)dt=CbS(Tb(t)−TS(t))−[Cc(TS(t)−Tm)+Cv(TS(t)−Ta(t))+βr((TS(t)+273.15)4−(Tr(t)+273.15)4)+Ce1TS(t)−Ce2Ta(t)−ce3]in(ti,tf),(1d)TK(ti)=TK,i,(1e)Tb(ti)=Tb,i,(1f)TS(ti)=TS,i,whereCbK,CbS,αo,Cc, Cv,βr,cR1,CR2,Ce1,Ce2andce3are positive constants according to [18,4,2,22]. Next, we give a brief description of the right-hand sides of Eqs. (1a)–(1c):•CbK(Tb−TK)andCbS(Tb−TS)represent the heat transfer per unit of volume produced by the circulation of the blood between the blood and kernel, and between the blood and the surface respectively. The coefficients of the terms in the model are estimated (cf. [2]) by(2)CbK=ρbϖbF˜Kand(3)CbS=ρbϖbF˜S.In (2) and (3) constantρbis the density of the blood,ϖbis the specific heat of the blood, andF˜SandF˜Kare the number of cubic meters of blood per second in layers S and K, respectively.The metabolic energy produced by food consumption is measured through the O2 consumption required to produce calories. It is known that1ml/kgminof O2 consumption produce4825cal/kgmin(cf. [22]). It can be assumed that the basal metabolic heat is proportional to the consumption of O2 (cf. [22]), i.e. it can be expressed in the formαoOo(t), where Oo(t) represents the O2 consumption measured inml/kgmin. This term should come asW/m3units to make sense of dimensional analysis in the composition of Eq. (1a).From the fact that1cal/seg=4.186W, a simple relationship of proportionality gives us thatOo(t)(ml/kgmin)of O2 corresponds to a production of4.82560Oo(t)(cal/kgseg)=4.825×4.18660Oo(t)(W/kg).Considering that it is in the nucleus where the basal metabolic heat is produced and that its density is 1030kg/m3, we obtain finally the following expression for the termαoOo(t)in (1a):αoOo(t)=1030×4.825×4.18660Oo(t)(W/m3)=346.722Oo(t)(W/m3).Thereforeαo=346.722kgmin/ml. According to [22], depending on the gestational age, life time and body weight, one can estimate an average value for oxygen consumption. We are considering a low-weight premature infant with 1.2kg, 1 or 2 days old and with an average oxygen consumption of3.9ml/kgmin. This data was taken from the table of oxygen consumption in basal conditions for the group IV infants, less than 36 weeks of gestation, weighting less that 1.5kg at the time of birth and with 1 or 2 days after birth (cf. [22]). In this case the termαoOo(t)corresponding to the basal metabolic heat is, approximately, 1352W/m3.cR1−CR2Tarepresents the heat losses through breathing. Following [18] the coefficients of these terms in the model are estimated by(4)cR1=γ1νN(3.2615971−0.0169533η)and(5)CR2=γ1νN(0.0915522−0.0012863η),whereγ1is a positive constant that depends on the temperature of the room where the incubator is located, N is the number of breaths per minute, η is the relative humidity inside the incubator and ν represents the tidal volume i.e. the amount of air entering the baby׳s lung with each breath, which is given in millilitres of air per kg of weight(ml/kg). For the characteristics of treated babies ν is estimated from their weight P byν={7.5ifP<1.5kg,9.5ifP≥1.5kg,Cc(TS−Tm)is related to the transference of heat through conduction. Following [4]Ccis a coefficient of volumetric transfer, given by(6)Cc=AεchcV.Here,A(m2)is the surface of the baby, which is estimated by the DuBois formula (cf. [23]):(7)A=0.20247l0.725P0.425,wherel(m) is the height of the baby andP(kg) is his weight. Constant V represents the volume of the baby׳s body, given byV=P/ρ. The constantεcis the fraction of the surface that is exposed to the conduction andhcis the heat conduction coefficient.Cv(TS−Ta)is related to the convective heat transfer. Coefficient Cvis estimated through(8)Cv=AεvhvV,where hvis the convection coefficient estimated, according to [4], byhv=1.901(1+0.0461143v).The termsv(cm/s) andεvrepresent the speed of the air in the interior of the incubator and the fraction of the baby׳s surface that is exposed to the convection effects, respectively. Note thatεc+εv=1([18]).βr((TS+273.15)4−(Tr+273.15)4)is related to the thermal radiation. According to [18](9)βr=σϵskεrAV,where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant,ϵskis the emissivity of the skin,εris the fraction of the surface of the baby that is exposed to the radiation.Ce1TS−Ce2Ta−ce3is an estimation of the heat transfer through evaporation (see [18]) with(10)Ce1=2.0282Aεehewγ2V,(11)Ce2=2.0282ηAεehewγ3V,and(12)ce3=28.7427(1−η)Aεehewγ4V.Here,heis the total heat transfer coefficient estimated byhe=hv(2.2°CmmHg)(760mmHgξ),ξ is the barometric pressure in the region of study,εeis the fraction of the surface of the baby that is exposed to the evaporation,γi, with i=2, 3, 4, are positive constants that depend on the temperature of the room where the incubator is located, η represents the relative humidity inside the incubator and w is a constant factor related to the fraction of the body that is exposed to the evaporation (it takes a minimum value of 0.06).In model (1a)–(1f) time is given in seconds and we have chosen one hour as the reference time. Moreover, the body temperature hovers around 37°C so that we use this value as the reference temperature. Then we consider the following normalized variables:TK⁎=TK/37,TS⁎=TS/37,Tb⁎=Tb/37,Tm⁎=Tm/37Tr⁎=Tr/37,Ta⁎=Ta/37,t⁎=t/3600.If we denote by Mithe new resulting coefficients in (1a)–(1c) (see Table 1), the normalized model is(13a)M1dTK⁎dt⁎=M2(Tb⁎−TK⁎)+M3Ta⁎−M4+M5Ooin(ti⁎,tf⁎),(13b)M6dTb⁎dt⁎=M2(TK⁎−Tb⁎)+M7(TS⁎−Tb⁎)in(ti⁎,tf⁎),(13c)M8dTS⁎dt⁎=M7(Tb⁎−TS⁎)−[M9(TS⁎−Tm⁎)+M10(TS⁎−Ta⁎)+M11((TS⁎+k)4−(Tr⁎+k)4)+M12TS⁎−M13Ta⁎−M14]in(ti⁎,tf⁎),(13d)TK⁎(ti⁎)=TK,i⁎,(13e)TS⁎(ti⁎)=TS,i⁎,(13f)Tb⁎(ti⁎)=Tb,i⁎.In this section we consider that the incoming air from the heater as well as the heating lamps is turned off, so that the average inside temperature (Ta) and the average temperature of the walls of the incubator (Tr) are equal to the temperature of the intensive care unit (ICU). We also assume that the temperature of the mattress remains constant. In such circumstances a premature newborn will be subjected to cold stress and it is reasonable to think that he or she will lose heat untilTK,TSandTbapproach a temperature close to that of the ICU.Before giving the general theorem we start with the following previous result:Lemma 4.1Hurwitz criterionLetP(λ)=λ3+b1λ2+b2λ+b3a polynomial withbi∈R,i=1,2,3. All the roots of P have negative real part if and only ifb1>0,b2>0,b3>0andb1b2>b3.See, for instance, [24].□Let us suppose that for certain value ofTa⁎>0(14)M3Ta⁎−M4+M5Oo=0.Then, system(13a)–(13c)has a unique positive stationary solution(TK,1⁎,Tb,1⁎,TS,1⁎)locally asymptotically stable. Furthermore,TK,1⁎=Tb,1⁎=TS,1⁎is the unique real positive root of equation(15)M11(TS⁎+k)4+BTS⁎=C,withB=M9+M10+M12andC=M9Tm⁎+(M10+M13)Ta⁎+M11(Tr⁎+k)4+M14.In order to get a stationary solution of system (13a)–(13c) we solve the following system:(16)M2(Tb⁎−TK⁎)=0,(17)M2(TK⁎−Tb⁎)+M7(TS⁎−Tb⁎)=0,(18)M7(Tb⁎−TS⁎)−[M9(TS⁎−Tm⁎)+M10(TS⁎−Ta⁎)+M11((TS⁎+k)4−(Tr⁎+k)4)+M12TS⁎−M13Ta⁎−M14]=0.From (16) and (17) we get thatTK⁎=Tb⁎=TS⁎. From (18) we have(19)M11(TS⁎+k)4+BTS⁎=C,withB=M9+M10+M12andC=M9Tm⁎+(M10+M13)Ta⁎+M11(Tr⁎+k)4+M14. LetT⁎=TS⁎+kthenT⁎4+θT⁎=ϕwithθ=BM11andϕ=C+BkM11.Using thatϕ>0, it is very easy to show that polynomial(20)Y(T⁎)=T⁎4+θT⁎−ϕhas two complex roots and two real roots, one positive and one negative. The negative root has no physical interpretation. We denote forT1=TS,1⁎+kthe positive root. Let us see thatTS,1⁎>0. IfTr⁎≤TS,1⁎it is trivial thatTS,1⁎>0(sinceTr⁎>0). On the other hand, ifTS,1⁎<Tr⁎we have (see (19))TS,1⁎>TS,1⁎+M11B((TS,1⁎+k)4−(Tr⁎+k)4)=M9Tm⁎+(M10+M13)Ta⁎+M14B>0.This allows us to conclude that under assumptions (14) there exists a unique positive stationary solution(TK,1⁎,Tb,1⁎,TS,1⁎)of (13a)–(13c) and it satisfies(21)TK,1⁎=Tb,1⁎=TS,1⁎.Now, we review the local stability of the stationary solution. First, we linearize system (13a)–(13c) around(TK,1⁎,Tb,1⁎,TS,1⁎). LetYK=TK⁎−TK,1⁎,Yb=Tb⁎−Tb,1⁎,YS=TS⁎−TS,1⁎,T1=TS,1⁎+k,A˜=(−M2M1M2M10M2M6−M2+M7M6M7M60M7M8−M7+M9+M10+M12+4M11T13M8)andY˜=(YK,Yb,YS)tr. The linearized system is expressed asdY˜(t)dt=A˜Y˜.To verify that the eigenvalues of matrixA˜have negative real part, in order to ensure the stability of stationary solution of system (13a)–(13c), we use the Hurwitz Criterion (see Lemma 4.1). The characteristic polynomial ofA˜isPA˜(λ)=λ3+b1λ2+b2λ+b3, with(22)b1=M2M1+M¯M8+M2+M7M6+M7M8,(23)b2=1M1M6M8(M1M7M¯)+1M1M6M8[M2M6M¯+M7(M2M6+M2M8)+M1M2(M7+M¯)],(24)b3=M7M2M¯M1M6M8,whereM¯=M9+M10+M12+4M11T13.From (22)–(24) and using the fact thatMi>0we have thatbi>0,i=1,2,3. Moreover, the product of the first term in b1 and b2 results in b3. From this, it follows thatb1b2>b3and finally we have that(TK,1⁎,Tb,1⁎,TS,1⁎)is a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium for the systems (13a)–(13c).□Note that the relation (14) is satisfied forTa=20°C, considering that M3, M4 and M5 take the values given in Table 3 (where M3 and M4 correspond to an infant that performs 40 breaths per minute on average) and with an average consumption of oxygenOo=3.9.In this section we consider all the coefficients Miwithi≠3,4in system (13a)–(13c) taking predetermined constants values as shows in Table 3.This is because they depend on a priori controllable magnitudes such as the temperature of the intensive care unit, the air velocity and the relative humidity inside the incubator, as well as some physical and physiological parameters that can be considered fixed for the case study.Coefficients M3 and M4 may vary due to the appearance of factor N in (4) and (5), corresponding to the number of breath per minute. Values of M3 and M4 in Table 3 are given for N=40.The same applies to the termTa⁎because the results that we will obtain must be valid in the range corresponding to a neutral thermal environment.Finally, we consider that the oxygen consumption Oomay vary in a neighborhood of 3.9.In the following we suppose thatTm=30°C,Ta∈[34,35.4]°C, i.e.Tm⁎=0.8108,Ta⁎∈[0.9189,0.9567],Oo∈[1.9,5.9], andM3=78.7625N,M4=76.3798NwithN∈[20,60]. Under these assumptions we study the possible equilibria for system (13a)–(13c). Equilibria(TK,2⁎,Tb,2⁎,TS,2⁎)satisfy the system of equations:(25a)M2(TK⁎−Tb⁎)=A(25b)M2(TK⁎−Tb⁎)+M7(TS⁎−Tb⁎)=0(25c)M11(Tr⁎+k)4=(M9+M10+M12)TS⁎+M11(TS⁎+k)4−(M10+M13)Ta⁎−M14−M9Tm⁎−A,whereA=78.7625NTa⁎−76.3798N+M5Oo.It is easy to obtain(26)TS⁎=TK⁎−M2+M7M2M7A≈TK⁎−4.74×10−6A,(27)Tb⁎=TK⁎−AM2≈TK⁎−1.35×10−6A.SolvingTr⁎in (25c) we have(28)(Tr⁎+k)4=(TK⁎+k−4.74×10−6A)4+1075.8TK⁎−1022.6Ta⁎−0.139A−30.Considering the range of variation of parametersTa⁎, N and Oo, we obtain from (28) the range where should varyTr⁎in order to have the componentTK,2⁎of the stationary state in the interval[0.9945,1.0081], which corresponds to the range of thermal stability (TK,2∈[36.8,37.3]°C). Taking into account the range of A and analyzing the sign of the partial derivatives of (28) with respect toTK⁎,Ta⁎, N and Ooit is easy to conclude that the maximum value ofTr⁎is obtained withTK,max⁎=1.0081,Nmax=60,Ta,min⁎=0.9189andOo,min=1.9, which corresponds to the valueAmin=418.4769while the minimum value ofTr⁎is obtained withTK,min⁎=0.9945,Nmin=20,Ta,max⁎=0.9567andOo,max=5.9, corresponding to the valueAmax=2025.11. Performing calculation with accuracy up to the fourth decimal number, we obtain that(29)Tr⁎∈[0.9052,1.0331](Tr∈[35.4,38.2]°C).From Eqs. (26) and (27) and taking into account the range of variation ofTK,2⁎(in thermal stability),Ta⁎, N and Ooone obtains(30)TS,2⁎∈[0.9849,1.0062](TS,2∈[36.4,37.2]°C),(31)Tb,2⁎∈[0.9918,1.0076](Tb,2∈[36.7,37.3]°C),From (26) and (27) it follows that(32)TS,2<Tb,2<TK,2andTK,2−TS,2≤(4.74)(37)×10−6A≤0.355°C,and so we come to the following conclusion: whenTK,2belongs to the range of thermal stability, the second condition for thermal stability required in Section 2 is fulfilled automatically in the stationary state.Note that (28) can be written in a equivalent form:(33)(Tr⁎+k)4=(TK⁎+k−4.74×10−6A)4+1075.8TK⁎−(1022.6+10.9479N)Ta⁎+(10.616N−48.19944Oo−30).Using that(Tr⁎+k)4−(TK⁎+k−4.74×10−6A)4≈4(k+1)3(TK⁎+k−4.74×10−6A)4then Eq. (33) can be rewritten as(34)Tr⁎=1.4566TK⁎−(0.43+0.004N)Ta⁎+0.004N−0.002Oo−0.012.and multiplying (34) by number 37 gives the following:(35)Tr=1.4566(TK−37)−(0.434+0.004N)(Ta−34.7)+0.009N−0.74Oo+38.4.The formula (35) gives us an expression of the approximate value ofTras a linear combination ofTK,Ta, N and OowhenTais in the range of thermal neutrality andTKin the range of thermal stability, such that there is a unique stationary state for the system (1a)–(1c) in a way that the component that corresponds to the core temperature of the newborn is the same asTK. We noticed that this formula is not similar to the different linear expressions betweenTrandTaobtained by Decima in [19]. In effect in [19] a heating lamp that can be controlled independently is not taken into account. In that case, the walls of the incubator are in contact with the ambient temperature of the ICU which is normally around 25°C. It is for this reason that [19] proposes strategies to measure the effective value ofTrso that it can estimate the heat loss by radiation of the newborn. Decima obtains different formulas to determine the corresponding value ofTrwhich depends onTa. In our case it is logical thatTrcan take a value given by the formula (35) since the radiant lamp can be controlled independently until it produces and stabilizes the temperature over the surface of the walls of the incubator. The form in which this is made is not an objective in this research. However, we consider that the effective value ofTrappearing in our model allows us to determine the losses by radiation of the newborn from Stefan Boltzmanns law that is the nonlinear term found in Eq. (1c). For practical uses we could consider any of the methods proposed in [19] to effectively calculateTr. According to formula (3) in [19],Trwas calculated by weighting the wall and mattress temperatures according to each calculated view factor. However, since our model considers the conductive effect produced on the child׳s warm mattress separately, we think that it would be appropriate to calculate an effective value ofTrfrom an average of measurements taken only on the surface of the incubator walls, regardless of the temperature of the mattress. The calculation of such effective valueTris not objective of this work.Let us now study the stability of the stationary solution. We linearize system (13a)–(13f) at the stationary solution(TK,2⁎,Tb,2⁎,TS,2⁎). LetX=(XKXbXS)andU=(UaUr),whereXK=TK⁎−TK,2⁎,Xb=Tb⁎−Tb,2⁎,XS=TS⁎−TS,2⁎,Ur=Tr⁎−Tr,2⁎andUa=Ta⁎−Ta,2⁎. The linearized system can be written as(36)dX(t)dt=AX+BU,X(t0)=0,where matrix A coincides with matrixA˜obtained in Section 4, except for the term a33 where nowTS,2⁎replacesTS,1⁎, finally obtaining(37)A=(−M2M1M2M10M2M6−M7+M2M6M7M60M7M8−M7+M9+M10+M12M8−4M11M8(T2)3),withT2=TS,2⁎+k, and(38)B=(M3M1000M10+M13M84M11M8(Tr,2⁎+k)3).In this case, matrix A has again (as in the proof of Theorem 4.1) eigenvalues with real negative part and we have the following theorem:Theorem 5.1Let us suppose that the temperatureTainside the incubator is constant belonging to the range of thermal neutrality and the parameters Ooand N are know within the ranges[1.9,5.9]and[20,60], respectively. In addition we setTrin a value that belongs to the interval determined by the formula(35)for the selected values of Ooand N andTKin the range of thermal stability. Then the system(13a)–(13f)has a unique asymptotically stable equilibrium(TK,2,Tb,2,TS,2)that satisfies the condition of thermal stability stated in Section2.According to the previous theorem for Oo=3.9 and N=40 we get thought (35) yieldsTrshould be selected in the range[35.2,36.7]°C. Note that from (26), (27) and (35) can give an approximate expression for the componentsTK,2,Tb,2andTS,2as a function ofTa,Tr, Ooand N. In effect (35) yields(39)TK,2=0.686Tr+(0.298+0.003N)(Ta−34.7)−0.006N+0.5Oo+10.6,Then from (26) and (27), we obtained(40)TS,2=TK,2−175.38×10−6A(41)Tb,2=TK,2−49.95×10−6AFinally we see that the result stated in Theorem 5.1 remains valid even for small variations of the parameters Mi,i=1,…,14. The assertion is a consequence of the following theorem which can be found in Section 4.1 of [25].Theorem 5.2Letf∈C1(E)where E is an open subset ofRncontaining a hyperbolic critical point x0ofẋ=f(x).Then for anyϵ>0there is aδ>0such that for allg∈C1(E)with∥f−g∥1=supx∈E|f(x)−g(x)|+supx∈E∥Df(x)−Dg(x)∥<δ.there exists a y0with|y0−x0|<ϵsuch that y0is a hyperbolic critical point ofẏ=g(y)furthermore,Df(x0)andDg(y0)have the same number of eigenvalues with negative real parts.In effect, we divide Eqs. (13a)–(13c) byM1,M6and M8 respectively. Then the system can be written in the vector form:dT⁎dt=F(M,T⁎)withT⁎=(TK⁎,Tb⁎,TS⁎). M is a vector of parameters with coordinates Mi,i=1,‥,14,Ta⁎,Tm⁎, Oo, N andF=(f1,f2,f3)is a vector function where f1 represents the right side of (13a) after being divided by M1, f2 and f3 are defined in an analogy way like f1 and they are associated to (13b), (13c). We can consider0<TK⁎,Tb⁎,TS⁎<2and therefore considerE=]2,2[×]0,2[×]0,2[. From M we get the variableM˜likeM˜=(M2M1,M3TaM1,M4M1,M5OoM1,M2M6,M7M6,M7M8,M9M8,M10M8,M11M8,M12M8,M13Ta⁎M8,M14M8)=(M˜i)i=113Let us useF˜=(f˜1,f˜2,f˜3), withf˜i(M˜,T)=fi(M,T),i=1,2,3. We consider two vectors M1 and M2 whenever, we get(42)|fi(M1,T)−fi(M2,T)|=|f˜i(M˜1,T)−f˜i(M˜2,T)|=|f˜i(M˜1−M˜2,T)|,Hence,(43)|f1(M1,T)−f1(M2,T)|≤2∑i=14|M˜i1−M˜i2|(44)|f2(M1,T)−f2(M2,T)|≤2∑i=56|M˜i1−M˜i2|(45)|f3(M1,T)−f3(M2,T)|≤2(k+2)4∑i=713|M˜i1−M˜i2|for allT∈E. Then the continuity ofM→M˜(R+14→R+13) gives us that for everyϵ>0there isδ1>0such that|M˜1−M˜2|<ϵ/4(k+2)4. Hence,(46)supT∈E|F(M1,T)−F(M2,T)|<ϵ2.We can find equations expressing∂fi/∂TK⁎,∂fi/∂Tb⁎and∂fi/∂TS⁎, in terms of fjwith i,j=1, 2, 3, in an analogous way we obtain a similar estimate for(47)supT∈E|DF(M1,T)−DF(M2,T)|where DF is the differential of F. Using Theorem 5.2 and considering two systems similar to (13a)–(13c) but with parameters M1 and M2 close together, so each of them has a stable point of equilibrium that at the same time is close to each other. This shows us that the result of Theorem 5.1 is little sensitive to small variations of the coefficients in (13a)–(13c).Now we carry out calculations based on our model for the particular case of premature newborns weighing 1.2kg at the time of being introduced into the incubator. Clinically the baby is in the critical state. We consider in the model the parameters corresponding to this weight. Henceforth, we use the values of the coefficients of system (13a)–(13c) expressed in Table 3, calculated from data in Tables 1 and 2(cf. [18,26,16,27]) and expressions (2)–(12). We assume that the average consumption of oxygen Oois3.9ml/kgmin, according to estimates of [22]. The neutral thermal environment suggested in [13] and [14] is the interval [34, 35.4]°C for the first 24h (time of simulations). In addition,εc,εe,εr, εvand νwere taken from [18] and finallyρbandhcwere obtained in [16]. We assume that the temperature of the mattressTmremains at 30°C, the temperature of the intensive care unit (Ten) is 20°C andTr=Ta=Ten. Then, if we take the values M3, M4, M5, Oogiven in Tables 2 and 3, (14) is satisfied. Using the bisection method we approximate the positive root of (20) byT⁎≈7.9239. Then, from Theorem 4.1 we have a stationary solution given by(48a)TK,1⁎=Tb,1⁎=TS,1⁎≈0.5410(TS≈20.01°C),with(48b)Tr,1⁎=Ta,1⁎≈0.5405(Ta=Tr=20°C),the values of the temperature of the walls of the incubator and the average air temperature inside. The corresponding stationary solution (48a) confirms that premature infants are unable to maintain their body temperature in ambient temperature conditions, which shows the importance of providing a suitable thermal environment. The linearized system at point (48a) is expressed asdY˜dt(t)=A˜Y˜(t),withA˜=(−18.495518.4955018−25.27.2011.1565−12.0196).The characteristic polynomial ofA˜isλ3+b1λ2+b2λ+b3withb1=55.7152>0,b2=578.0447>0,b3=114.9391>0andb1b2=32206>b3. Then, from Lemma 4.1 we deduce that system (13a)–(13f) has a stable local equilibrium given by (48a)(Fig. 1).Although the initial temperature of the baby is equal to 37°C in the described conditions the temperature will drop gradually until it reaches values close to 20°C. Fig. 1 shows the behaviour of the core temperature.We conclude that in the absence of controls, when the baby is directly under the temperature of the ICU, his or her body temperature tends to stabilize at a value close to that temperature even when the mattress is kept at a temperature above.Now, we consider the particular case in which the average temperature inside the incubator is constant and equal toTa=34.7°C(midpoint of the neutral thermal environment) and the average temperature of the walls of the incubator is constant and equal toTr=35.39°C. Then the stationary solution of system (13a)–(13c) is(49)TK,2⁎=1,Tb,2⁎=0.9983,TS,2⁎=0.9940.Now, we linearize system (13a)–(13f) at point (49) and we have(50)dXdt(t)=AX(t)+BU,X(t0)=0,where(51)A=(−18.495518.4955018−25.27.2011.1565−12.1213)and(52)B=(0.07890000.28790.6530).Matrix A has eigenvalues −42.0311, −13.5604 and −0.2254 and, therefore, the equilibrium state (49) is asymptotically stable.The World Health Organization [1] considers a normal range[36.5,37.5]°C for the body temperature, we call it the acceptable range or normal range forTK(axillary temperature). When the temperature is outside this range the newborn is at risk (he may die). This temperature range is called undesirable risk range forTK. Moreover, Lyon [10] states that the range in which premature newborns show thermal stability is[36.8,37.3]°C range which we call the ideal range forTK.In this manuscript we consider premature newborns weighing 1.2 kg who are treated in an incubator although the numerical results do not vary substantially for parameters that correspond to the range between 1kg and 1.5kg. We consider a simulation period for 24h. The neutral thermal environment suggested in [13,14] is [34, 35.4]°C for the first 24h, which we call ideal range forTa(average temperature inside the incubator). Reference ranges for temperaturesTKandTaare shown in Table 4. Assuming thatTais in neutral thermal environment (ideal range) Table 5shows the time forTKto get into the thermal stability range (ideal range forTK).The fact that some cases take a long time to reach the desirable state is due to the existence of a negative eigenvalue of matrix (51) very close to zero. In the next section we will see that controlling the temperature inside the incubator can considerably reduce this time.We begin by recapitulating some concepts of controllability and observability (for more information, see [24,28]).Consider a system with n inputs and p states governed by the equation(53a)dx(t)dt=Ax+Buwith constant matricesA∈R(n×n),B∈R(n×p).It is said that the state equation (53a) is controllable if for any initial statex(0)=x0∈Rnand any final statex1∈Rnthere is an input u that transfers the statex(t)from x0 to x1 in finite time. It is known that the system (53a) is controllable if and only if the controllability matrixK=[BABA2B⋯A(n−1)B]has rank n.If an equation describing q observable outputs of the system is added to state equation (53a) in the form(53b)y=Cx+Du,then we say that with respect to the output (53b), the state equation (53a) is observable if for any initial statex(0)(unknown) there is a finite time t1 such that knowledge of the input u(t) and the output y(t) on the interval[0,t1]is sufficient to uniquely determine the initial statex(0).It is also known that the state equation (53a) is observable with respect to the output (53b), if and only if the observability matrixO=(CCACA2⋮CAn−1)has rank n. In this case we will be using the variables found in the premature infant Group IV, which are going to be the parameters used in the (13a)–(13c) system. The values are associated to premature infants with weight less than 1.5kg at birth and with one or two days old:(54)Oo∈[1.9,5.9],M3=78.7625N,M4=76.3798NwithN∈[20,60]and the rest of the coefficients Miand K are given in Table 3. We also consider that(55)Tm=30°C,Ta=[34,35.4]°C(NTE)In addition,Tris in a value that belongs to the interval determined by the formula (35) for the selected values of Oo, N andTawithTKvarying in the range of thermal stability (TK∈[36.7,37.3]°C). This allows us to conclude that (39)–(41) are valid equations. Consider now the state equation (36) with A and B being defined by (37) and (38), respectively, which corresponds to the linearization of system (13a)–(13f) around the corresponding equilibrium state(TK,2⁎,Tb,2⁎,TS,2⁎).Assuming thatTacan vary in a neighbourhood ofTa,2, we can considerUa=Ta⁎−Ta,2⁎as the only control in the state equation (36). This situation can be represented by replacing matrix B in (36) by the matrix B1 constituted by the first column of the matrix B and for this reason we consider the state equation:(56a)dX(t)dt=AX+B1UaTo study the observability we remember that the incubator has two temperature sensors monitoring the baby, one in the armpit (to approximateTK) and the other one in the sole (to approximateTS). We assume that onlyTKis monitored, which can be formulated mathematically as follows:(56b)Z=hX,withh=(100).In the following we study the controllability and observability of system (56a) and (56b). The following lemma allows us determine more precisely the location of the eigenvalues of matrix A and will be used in the analysis of the controllability of system (56a) and (56b).Lemma 7.1Let us assume that the model׳s parameters meet the conditions mentioned above for premature infants of group IV. Then matrix A has only one negative real eigenvalue which belongs to the interval]−42.1,−42[and two complex conjugate eigenvalues with negative real part.Note that all coefficients aijof matrix A are constant except a33, whereT2⁎appears, which depends on parameters N, OoandTa⁎yTr⁎. From (30), it is easy to conclude that coefficient a33 of matrix A is expressed in the forma33=−(11.4594+s)withs∈I=[0.1623,0.173]. Then we have(57)A=(−18.495518.4955018−25.27.2011.1565−(11.4594+s)),If we denote by λ the eigenvalues of matrix A and by(x,y,z)the eigenvectors, we obtain(58)y=(1+λ18.4955)x(59)18x−25.2y+7.2z=λy(60)11.1565y−(11.4594+s)z=λzSubstituting (58) into (59) and (60) we have(61)[(λ+25.2)(λ+18.4955)−332.919]x=133.1676z(62)11.1565(λ+18.4955)x=18.4955(11.4594+s+λ)z,Withλ+s+11.4594≠0. In other case, from (62) we have x=0, from (58) and (61) we obtainy=z=0. This allows us to conclude that under these assumptions λ is not eigenvalue of matrix A. Multiplying (61) by18.4955(11.4594+s+λ)and (62) by 133.1676 thus becomes(63)P(λ,s)=λ3+(55.1549+s)λ2+(553.565+43.6955)λ+(40.3364+133.1676s)=0The cubic polynomialP(λ,s)attains its local extreme in the roots of the quadratic polynomial:(64)Pλ′(λ,s)=3λ2+2(55.1549+s)λ+(553.565+436955s).If we denote by b and c the coefficient of λand the constant term in (64), respectively, then it is easy to see that the derivative ofb2−12cwith respect to s is equal to4(2s−20.7767)which is strictly negative in the range of variation of s and thereforeb2−12cis decreasing in that interval. Then the smallest value ofb2−12cin the interval I is achieved when s=0.173 and is equal to 5510.5081. We conclude thatb2−12cis positive throughout the interval I, and therefore the polynomialPλ′(λ,s)always has two real roots for alls∈I. The fact that the coefficients ofPλ′(λ,s)are always positive follows that both roots are always negatives. The roots λs ofPλ′(λ,s)are around −6 and −30 for alls∈I. It is easy to seeP(λs;s)>0, from here we conclude thatP(λ;s)has a single real rootλ0(s)which is negative for alls∈I. On the other hand,P(−42,s)>=5.901∀s∈IP(−42.1,s)≤−114.7016∀s∈Ifrom here we concludeλ0(s)∈]−42.1,−42[∀s∈I.□The fact that the two complex conjugate roots have negative real part is a consequence of Theorem 5.1.Theorem 7.1Suppose the model parameters satisfy the conditions listed above for premature infants of Group IV. Then the state equation(56a)is controllable.To prove the controllability of (50a) we use the PBH range test which tells us that it is enough to show that(65)rank[λId−A,B1]=3foralls∈R.It is clear that (65) holds forλ≠λ0(s). Therefore it is enough to show (65) forλ=λ0(s),s∈I. But then (65) is equivalent to prove that(66)Ker[λId−A⁎B1t]=(0000).Using expression (57) and the fact thatB1=(b,0,0.2879)tr, (66) is reduced to prove that system(67)(−18.4955−λ18018.4955−25.2−s11.156507.2−(11.4594+s+λ)−b0−0.2879)(v1v2v3)=(0000)has only the trivial solution for any(68)λ∈]−42.1,−42[,s∈I=[0.1623,0.173],b∈[0.0394,0.1184].From (67) it follows thatv3=(−b/0.2879)v1and therefore, it is sufficient to study the reduced system:(69)(−18.4955−λ18018.495532−25.2−λ11.156507.2−(11.4594+s+λ))(v1v2−b0.2879v1)=(000).Now, (69) is equivalent tov2=18.4955−38.7513b25.2+λv1=18.4955+λ18v1=11.4594+s+λ2.0728bv1The above will meet withv1=0if it satisfies the system(70)18.4955+λ=−8.6839b(11.4594+s+λ)(71)332.919−697.5234b=(25.2+λ)(18.4955+λ)in the range of values of λ, s and b given in (68). However, it is easy to see that Eq. (70) can not be solved in this range of parameters as its right-hand side is always negative while the left-hand side is always positive in that range. From here we conclude the truth of (67) so that the state equation (56a) is controllable.□Suppose the model parameters satisfies the conditions listed above for premature infants of group IV. Then state equation(56a)is observable with respect to the output(56b).It is known that the observability of system (56a) and (56b) depends only on matrix A and vector h and the condition of observability is equivalent to the controllability of the pair(A⁎,ht). Then, repeating the argument of Theorem 7.1, we see that it is equivalent to show thatrank[sId−A⁎,ht]=3, for allλ∈]−42.1,−42[,s∈I=[0.1623,0.173].For this purpose it is sufficient to check that matrixA0=(18.4955+λ−181−18.495525.2+λ00−7.20)have non-zero determinant for allλ∈]42.1,−42[. It is easy to verify that this is true sincedetA0does not depend on λ:detA0=133.1676.Thus the theorem is proved.□So far we have shown that keeping the temperature inside the incubator (Ta) in the neutral thermal environment, the system tends to a stable equilibrium with the core temperature of the baby in the range of thermal stability. However for some initial conditions the core temperature can stay out the ideal range for a very large period of time (see Table 5), which may damage the health of the baby. Therefore we want to minimize this time interval. To do this, we minimize the mean square deviations of the normalized valuesTK⁎andTS⁎with respect to their ideal constant valuesTK,2⁎andTS,2⁎that represent the normalized ideal values of the central and peripheral temperatures, in the range of thermal stability. That is, valuesTK,2⁎andTS,2⁎(see (49)) represents the equilibrium of the system (13a)–(13c) whenTa, Ooand N take the valuesTa,mean=34.7°C(Ta,mean⁎=0.9378),Oo,mean=3.9,Nmean=40(mean values of ideal ranges of variation ofTa, Ooand N), the model data are given in Tables 2 and 3 and assume thatTm=30°C(Tm⁎=0.8823)andTr=Tr,meanis calculated by formula (35).For that purpose, it is interesting to study the following minimization problem:(72)minTa⁎max∣T⁎(ti⁎)−T2⁎∣≤r0J(Ta⁎,T⁎(0))=∫ti⁎tf⁎|TK⁎−TK,2⁎|2dt+∫ti⁎tf⁎|TS⁎−TS,2⁎|2dt,whereTK⁎andTS⁎are the solution of system (13a)–(13f) whenTa⁎is in the interval[0.9189,0.9567], which corresponds to the range of neutral thermal environment andTris given by equation (35). In (72) we have denoted byT⁎(ti⁎)the vector of initial conditions (13d)–(13f) and byT2⁎the vector corresponding to the stationary solution (49). By∣T⁎(ti⁎)−T2⁎∣we denote the Euclidean distance between the two vectors and r0 represents a threshold for initial conditions. Since the non-linearity of system (13a)–(13f) makes it difficult to study the problem of Min–Max (72), we will assume that the initial normalized values of central and peripheral temperatures of the baby are close to their ideal valuesTK,2⁎andTS,2⁎. Then replace in (72) the termsTK⁎−TK,2⁎andTS⁎−TS,2⁎for the corresponding solutions of the system (13a)–(13f) linearized around the vectorT2⁎. In this case the problem (72) is reduced to the Min–Max problem:(73)min∣Ua∣≤0.0189max∣X0∣≤μ0J0(Ua,X0)=∫t0t1[XK2+XS2]dt=∫t0t1[XtrGX]dt,where XKand XSrepresent components of the solution of the system (56a) obtained forOo=Oo,meanandN=Nmean, with initial conditionX0=X(t0),t0=ti⁎,t1=tf⁎, μ0 represents again a threshold for initial conditions andG=(100000001).Note that the functional does not set the thermal stability criterion. The functional minimizes the distances to ideal values for central and peripheral temperatures. However, these ideal values are far from each other in less than 1°C and we will see in numerical examples that a similar result is obtained for the functionsTKandTScorresponding to the solution of problem (73). In Section 9, we will see that, following our approach, the time interval in which the core temperature of the baby is out of the ranges of thermal stability decreases considerably.In this section we study the control problem of linear stabilization for the system (56a) and (56b) whenTa⁎=Ta,mean⁎,Oo=Oo,meanandN=Nmean, which we hereafter simply refer as system (56a) and (56b). We say that a linear system of the form (53a) is stabilizable if there is a matrix Q such that if we take control U as U=Qx, then the trivial solution of the system is asymptotically stable. It is well known (see [2]) that if (53a) is controllable, then it is also stabilizable. From the results shown above we know that (56a) is stabilizable and is also observable with respect to the output (56b). For this reason we propose to stabilize system (56a) using controls of the form(74)Ua=qXKwithq∈R.Min–Max problem (73) becomes(75)minq∈Qmax∣X0∣≤μ0∫t0t1XtrGXdt,where X is a solution of(76)dXdt=(A+qB1h)X=FqX,X(t0)=X0,∣X0∣≤μ0and(77)Q={q∈R:Reλi<0,∀λieigenvalueofA+qB1h},(78)qB1h=(b1q00000b3q00).To solve problem (75) and (76) we assume thatt1=∞and transform the Min–Max problem of optimal stabilization into a non-linear programming problem.Lemma 9.1Suppose thatt1=∞and let Hqbe the only solution of the matrix equation:(79)Fq⁎H+HFq=−G,where Fqis defined in(76)withq∈Q(see(77)). Then(80)∫t0t1XtrGXdt=X0,trHqX0for all solution X(t) of the Cauchy problem(76).It is known that the general solution of the matrix differential equation(81)dZdt=FqtrZ+ZFq,Z(t0)=Gis(82)Z(t)=eFqtrtGeFqt.Integrating Eq. (81) between 0 and∞givesFqtr∫t0∞Z(t)dt+∫t0∞Z(t)dtFq=∫t0∞dZdtdt=Z(∞)−Z(0)=−G.In fact, from (82) we conclude thatZ(∞)=0, since matrix Fqhas eigenvalues with negative real part. Then(83)Hq=∫t0∞Z(t)dtis a solution of Eq. (78), which is easily seen to have a unique solution. From (83) it is obtained that Hqis symmetric. Finally, from (82) we conclude that equality (80) holds and H is positive semidefinite.□From the previous lemma we obtain the inequality(84)minq∈Qmax∣X0∣≤μ0∫t0t1XtrGXdt≤μ0minq∈Qζ(q),whereζ(q)denotes the largest eigenvalue of Hq. So to solve the Min–Max problem (75) we consider the inequality (84) and proceed following the next steps:Step 1.describe the setQ,find Hqsuch that−Gq=FqTHT+HFq,find the maximum eigenvalueζ(q)of Hq,minimizeζ(q).Step 1: From (74) and (76) it follows that(85)Fq=(0.000025(−738180+3150.5q)18.4955018−25.27.20.2879q11.1565−12.1221).The characteristic polynomial of Fqis(86)PFq(λ)=λ3−k1λ2−k2λ−k3,withk1=−55.8157+0.0789q.k2=−528.524+2.9462q,k3=−128.59+56.113q,We seek q such that(87)k1<0,k2<0,k3<0andk1k2+k3>0,such thatPFq(λ)have all roots with negative real part (see Lemma 4.1). From inequalities (87) it follows thatq<2.2916. On the other hand, bearing in mind thatTK∈[36.8,37.3]and that the neutral thermal environment is[34,35.4], then−0.0067<XK<0.0067andUa∈[−0.0189,0.0189]. We conclude that forUa=qXKit is necessary that q take values in the interval−2.8≤q≤2.8, so that(88)Q=[−2.8,2.2916].Step 2: We look for a matrix(89)H=(abcbdecef)satisfying−G=FTHT+HF, that is(90a)a=(202156+2662.85q+110.498q2−0.3374q3)(319106−140770q+665.822q2−1·q3),(90b)b=(198857+3845.92q+54.8234q2−0.0975q3)(319106−140770q+665.822q2−q3),(90c)c=(119659+1784.53q−44.1384q2+0.0925q3)(319106−140770q+665.822q2−q3),(90d)d=(200846+2638.45q+36.6927q2−0.0597q3)(319106−140770q+665.822q2−q3),(90e)e=(123994−416.204q−8.0071q2+0.0267q3)(319106−140770q+665.822q2−q3),(90f)f=(86808.9−6053.54q+22.7072q2−0.0253q3)(319106−140770q+665.822q2−q3).Step 3: Characteristic polynomial of the matrix H is given by(91)PH(ζ)=−ζ3+w1ζ2+w2ζ+w3,where the coefficients wi,i=1,2,3are expressed in terms of (90a)–(90f) byw1=a+d+f,w2=b2+c2+e2−(a+d)f−ad,w3=adf+2bec−c2d−e2a−b2f.From Lemma 9.1 we conclude that polynomial (91) has three real roots greater than or equal to zero and not all zero. Through Cardano׳s formulas the maximum rootζ(q)can be expressed in terms of the coefficients wiand subsequently can be calculated numerically using Mathematica Version 7.0.Step 4: We obtain thatζ(q)takes its minimum value atq=−2.8. Note that if you replace the value ofq=−2.8in (90a)–(90f) matrixH−2.8given by (89) is positive definite.Therefore, we conclude that temperature inside the incubator should vary according to the following expression:(92)Ta⁎=Ta,2⁎−2.8(TK⁎−TK,2⁎).Finally, for the thermal management of premature newborns we can proceed in two ways: (a) maintain a constant temperature inside the incubator and equal to 34.7°C or (b) modify the internal temperature according to (92). Below there are tables comparing the two situations. The tables show, based on initial distribution of some average temperaturesTK,TbandTSof the baby, how long the child remains in the risk range or outside the ideal range. Also, the temperature variations inside the incubator are monitored and we show how long the temperature is outside the neutral thermal environment which is strongly recommended by neonatologists.What we see in general is that, although the babies are at a temperature in the ideal range when starting the treatment, their temperatures always fall to values lower than ideal. Once the temperatures rise again, they are successfully kept in the ideal range.Table 6shows what happens when the initial temperatures lie in the ideal range. In the second and the third table we display other cases when initial temperatures are based on an acceptable range. Tables 7 and 8correspond to cases where the initial temperature is at risk. Remember that the goal of the treatment in the incubator is to take the child to the ideal range of core temperature in the shortest time possible and keep him or her within this range ensuring that the ambient temperature is maintained in the range of neutrality.In the following tablesTK(t0),Tb(t0)andTS(t0)denote the initial temperature of the baby׳s body at the beginning of the treatment in the incubator, the termstidandtaceprepresent the time during which the baby lives outside the ideal and acceptable ranges respectively. In some cases, as it is shown in the tables, time intervals were measured in hours and in other cases in minutes. By rankTawe denote the range in which temperature is inside the incubator to implement control andtambrepresent the time during which the ambient temperature is outside the recommended ranges. It is important to note that our model describes only the changes in temperature in the child body but not in the environment and that this temperature must be precisely controlled. A major problem that must be addressed in subsequent studies is to answer the question of how hot air entering into the incubator should be controlled in order to produce the given ambient temperature in (92).In order to explain the obtained results in the tables, we consider one example that is to observe the first two lines of Table 6. The results are interpreted in the following way: The newborn is put into the incubator with an axillary temperature of 36.8°C, a temperature in the blood of 36.325°C and a sole of the foot temperature of 35.85°C. The temperature in the interior of the incubator can be kept constant, which is shown in the first line with q=0, or it can vary according to (92), in this case it is represented in the second line of the table:q=−2.8. The results of the table show that if q=0 then the central temperature of the baby is out of the ideal range during 287.77min out of which 16.58min are out of the acceptable range; that is, the baby is likely to suffer from hypothermia. This occurs when leaving the ambient temperature fixed to 34.7°C (average point of the neutral thermal environment). The case that the additional linear control (q=−2.8) is considered decreases the time in which the temperature of the baby is out of the ideal range which is equal to 131.44min out of which only 0.1min are kept in risky temperatures. In this case, the temperature of the environment ranges between the interval of 34.7 and 36.04°C keeping out from the ideal and recommended interval forTaapproximately 84.58min. This shows that it is convenient to consider the linear component of the control although it is necessary to maintain the surrounding temperature in ranges above neutrality for a time. It can be observed in Table 6 that in the first three cases, it is more efficient to use the control with the linear term. Moreover, while the central temperature increases and the gradient (Tg=TK−TS) decreases, it is enough to maintain the temperature of the environment at 34.7°C as it is shown from the initial temperaturesTK=37.05°C,Tb=36.725°C andTS=36.4°C.In Table 7 we consider the acceptable temperatures under the range of the ideal temperatures and we observe that the control is more efficient with the linear term. In Table 8, we show the results for the initial temperatures above the range of ideal temperatures. It can be observed that for such initial temperatures, the temperature of the environment can even be fixed at 34.7°C. This is because the times that are out of the ideal (tid) and the acceptable (tacep) range do not decrease a lot with the linear component.The results that correspond to the cases in which the baby is under thermal stress are also divided into two parts (Tables 9 and 10). The tables represent the case in which the baby suffers from a simple hypothermia to a moderate one. The results of Table 9show that the control is more efficient if we consider the linear part. From the results shown in Table 10, we conclude that in the cases of moderate hypothermia it is convenient to use the control with a linear component.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The physiological changes involving the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life defy the respiratory, central nervous, circulatory, thermoregulatory, and immune system. All the problems of newborns, in some way or other, include different adaptation mechanism to survive.In the low-weight premature and/or sick newborns, such problems exacerbate even more to put their health at serious risk. It is important to warm up the surrounding space. This measure fairly decreased newborn health problems keeping him or her in save and stable conditions. Vital body functions depend on constant body temperature within its normal range. In the case of newborns the World Health Organization states values between 36.8 and 37.5°C as a normal level for the core temperature. However, we are interested in keeping the newborn in an even narrower thermal stability range, with an environment temperature between 36.8 and 37.3°C, which we call ideal range.The purpose of this study was to determine the values of temperature average inside the incubator and the incubator walls to stabilize a premature newborn in thermal stability in the shortest time possible. We propose a model that describes the variation of temperatures center-weighted average (can be estimated by the temperature in the armpit), peripheral (it can be estimated by the temperature of the sole) and blood.Associated with this thermal model we propose a functional for minimizing the time the core temperature stays out the thermal stability range. Both the model and the functional are valuable assets to solve the controlling problem applying a linearization of the system. We test the results in the original nonlinear model for comparison. To simplify the task we assume that the baby׳s body consists of a single compartment with three components: core, blood and skin. We assume that the blood exchanges heat with the skin and the core. The model incorporates the main mechanisms to quantitatively describe physiological and physical mechanisms of heat generation and its exchange, in particular basal metabolism, heat flow between the kernel and surface, the contribution of blood circulation, respiratory losses, lost extra glandular and the processes of heat exchange with the atmosphere (conduction, convection, radiation).The estimates for each term as well as their coefficients were taken from the literature. Some of the parameters in the model depend directly from the newborn and can be modified in each case. Among these parameters are birth weights, weight during the period of the simulations, the consumption of oxygen, relative humidity, air velocity inside the incubator, the number of breaths per minute. The model reproduces what happens when a newborn is exposed to room temperature (20°C). In that case the temperature of the body may decrease and stabilize at a temperature close to the room temperature, outside the acceptable range.Moreover, the model describes the fact that when we maintain the temperature inside the incubator in the range of neutral thermal environment then the baby is in thermal stability. This demonstrates the important influence of the environment variables which are reflected in the professional recommendations of pediatricians and neonatologists. However, in practice, the desirable state of baby׳s temperatures requires a couple of hours, which constitutes a precious time, that can even be detrimental for the child. It obviously becomes a necessity to incorporate an additional control to achieve the ideal body temperature of the baby in a much shorter time.Although the model does not describe the dynamics of environment temperatures, we can treat the thermal behaviour through numerical solution to regulate the temperature inside the incubator to stabilize the baby׳s body temperature in even shorter periods of time than before and without leaving the recommended ranges for the baby׳s safety.Inspecting the results it seems that monitoring the baby׳s axillary temperature is sufficient because it reflects all the variation of the core, peripheral and blood temperatures. Besides, incubator temperature management could imply to be a major technological challenge when it comes to its real-life electronic implementation to achieve the aforementioned goals to stabilize the baby thermal situation as quickly as possible.As the most valuable asset, the present work can not only be extended and applied to other time intervals as well as groups of premature babies but it can also handle other input values for the given parameters.Future studies, as a straight-forward continuation may extend the present one-compartment model to develop multi-compartment models where the human body will be divided into more realistic areas of defined biological activities. This can be achieved by mathematical approaches based on our model.
