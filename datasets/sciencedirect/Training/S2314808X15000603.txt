@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A series of azosalicylic acid analogs were newly synthesized by coupling various aryl and heteroarylamine functionalities with salicylic acid nucleus. All the synthesized compounds were structurally confirmed by various modern analytical methods. The said synthesized compounds were screened to investigate their antimicrobial, analgesic and antioxidant activities. The compounds 4e and 4h showed excellent significant antibacterial activity against most of the bacterial strains as no compounds showed significant antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans. The bromine substituted molecule 4e (4-bromo-3-methyl phenyl azosalicylic acid analog) showed the highest significant analgesic activity with 46.10% of inhibition. The results of in vitro antibacterial and analgesic activity were justified with the outcome of in-silico investigation. The results of biological activities were statistically interpreted. The compounds substituted with antipyrinylazo and 4-carboxy phenylazo moiety exhibited potential antioxidant activity.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The writings of Greek physician Hippocrates revealed that the leaves and barks of willow tree were used as analgesic and antipyretic in early days. The active constituent responsible in this natural source, later identified as salicin, contains both sugar and aromatic component, initially called as spirasure and later salicylic acid. The de-novo synthesis of salicylic acid was first performed in 1852 and its structure was deduced as 2-hydroxy benzoic acid [1]. The salicylic acid derivatives exhibited antioxidant, antiproliferative [2] and cytotoxic activities [3]. The azo salicylic acid derivative sulfasalazine is a proven drug for the last 40 years which is effective against ulcerative colitis (inflammatory bowel disease) [4]. There has been an increase in the side-effects due to the sulfapyridine portion which acts as a carrier. The azo bond breaks due to the bacterial enzyme azo-reductase present at the site of lumen of the colon leaving the 5-aminosalicylic acid. The azobis-salicylic acid derivative olsalazine could be a better alternative for sulfasalazine. Literature survey supports that azo-salicylic acids have biological activity and also are useful precursors for the synthesis of anticarcinogenic, antiviral, antimicrobial and antimalarial agents [3]. Salicylates have analgesic effects similar to that of other NSAIDs to inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) [5]. NSAIDs inhibit both the activity of COX-1 and COX-2 and thereby synthesis of prostaglandin and thromboxane [6]. Literature support also suggests that bromine substituted molecules can show potential analgesic activity [7]. Further, literature survey indicates that pyrazolone nucleus is the key pharmacophore and is responsible for various pharmacological activities such as analgesic [8] and antimicrobial activity [9]. The N-phenyl substituted anthranyl congeners also have analgesic, antirheumatic and antiinflammatory activities [10]. The above information encouraged us to synthesize a new range of azo-salicylic acid congeners with different aryl and heteroaryl functionalities and to investigate the antibacterial, analgesic and antioxidant activities. The structures were confirmed by spectral characterization. The synthesized azosalicylic acid congeners act as ligands individually against the targeted proteins (PDB ID: 3SPU of NDM-1 and 1CX2 of COX-2) by computational docking method for the evaluation of antibacterial and analgesic activities respectively.Structures of some newly synthesized azosalicylic acid congenersAll the chemicals used in the present study were of synthetic grade and sourced from Merck Specialties Ltd. (Mumbai, India). The structural conformation of the synthesized compounds from salicylic acid is conducted by various modern analytical techniques viz. FT/IR (JASCO FT/IR 4100 Spectrophotometer using KBr disc), 1H NMR (Bruker 1H NMR 400 MHz) using TMS as an internal standard, LC–MS (Shimadzu-mass spectrometer) and Differential Scanning calorimetric analysis (METTLER TOLEDO STARe system at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, temperature range 30–350 °C using aluminum cans calibrated with indium) and elemental analysis (Perkin Elmer-2400 CHNO/S analyzer system). Solvent behavior of the compounds was studied by UV–Visible spectrophotometer (JASCO V-630 Spectrophotometer). The melting points were determined by open capillary method (Elico) and were uncorrected. The synthesized ligands were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against different pathogens by Agar Well Diffusion method. The results of the potential antibacterial and analgesic activity of the selected ligands were rationalized by molecular docking.The synthesis of the aryl/heteroaryl azo salicylic acid analogs was carried out on the basis of our earlier reported work [11] (Scheme 1).Dark red color powder; yield 75%; Rf 0.8; mp (°C); 297–300; UV–vis (λmax, ethanol): 366 nm; IR (KBr, γ, cm−1): 3374 (OH str.), 1676 (CO str.), 1587 (CC str.), 1482 (NN), 1331, 1160 (SO2 str.SO2NH2), 910 (S-N str.), 1096 (CO str.); 1H NMR (CDCl3, δppm, 400 MHz): 7.46 (s, 2H, SO2NH2), 8.01–8.10 (m, 4H, Ar H), 12.10 (sb. 1H, COOH), 11.69 (sb, 1H, OH), 7.36 (d, 1H, salicylic H-3), 8.11 (d, 1H, salicylic H-4), 8.34 (s, 1H, salicylic H-6); LC–MS (% area); 77.65; m/z; 320.13 (M-1); Analysis for C13H11N3O5S: Calcd % C, 48.59; H, 3.45; N, 13.08; S, 9.98; Found %: C, 48.19; H, 3.48; N, 13.11; S, 9.95.Yellow color powder; yield 72%; Rf 0.8; mp (°C); 328–330; UV–vis (λmax, ethanol): 361 nm; IR (KBr, γ, cm−1): 3431 (OH str.), 1671 (CO str.), 1628 (CC str.), 1448 (NN), 1389, 1206 (SO2 str.SO3H), 1127 (CO str.); 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, δppm, 400 MHz): 7.83–8.34 (m, 4H, Ar H), 11.69 (sb. 1H, OH), 12.10 (sb, 1H, COOH), 7.28 (d, 1H, salicylic H-3), 8.08 (d, 1H, salicylic H-4), 8.34 (s, 1H, salicylic H-6); LC–MS (% area); 52.33; m/z; 321.08 (M-1); Analysis for C13H10N2O6S: Calcd % C, 48.45; H, 3.13; N, 8.69; S, 9.95; Found %: C, 48.42; H, 3.09; N, 8.62; S, 9.91.Dark red color powder; yield 92%; Rf 0.7; mp (°C); 243–245; UV–vis (λmax, ethanol): 388 nm; IR (KBr, γ, cm−1): 3456, 3210 (OH str.), 1672 (CO str.), 1610 (CC str.), 1482 (NN), 1530, 1344 (NO2 str.), 1106 (CO str.); 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, δppm, 400 MHz): 7.75–8.25 (m, 4H, Ar H), 11.75 (sb. 1H, OH), 12.09 (sb, 1H, COOH), 7.31 (d, 1H, salicylic H-3), 8.13 (d, 1H, salicylic H-4), 8.35 (s, 1H, salicylic H-6); LC–MS (% area); 91.62; m/z; 286.12 (M-1); Analysis for C13H9N3O5: Calcd % C, 54.36; H, 3.16; N, 14.63; Found % C, 54.26; H, 3.11; N, 14.60.Black color powder; yield 95%; Rf 0.8; mp (°C); 238–240; UV–vis (λmax, ethanol): 374 nm; IR (KBr, γ, cm−1): 3464 (OH str.), 2926 (CH2 str.), 1667 (CO str.), 1596 (CC str.), 1491 (NN), 1111 (CO str.); 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, δppm, 400 MHz): 7.05–7.75 (m, 4H, Ar H), 3.83 (s, 3H, ArOCH3), 11.37 (sb. 1H, OH), 12.13 (sb, 1H, COOH), 7.37 (d, 1H, salicylic H-3), 8.11 (d, 1H, salicylic H-4), 8.27 (s, 1H, salicylic H-6); LC–MS (% area); 71.88; m/z; 273.21 (M+1); Analysis for C14H12N2O4: Calcd % C, 61.76; H, 4.44; N, 10.29; Found %: C, 61.86; H, 4.34; N, 10.19.Brown color powder; yield 85%; Rf 0.8; mp (°C); 288–290; UV–vis (λmax, ethanol): 361 nm; IR (KBr, γ, cm−1): 3451 (OH str.), 2937 (CH str.), 1661 (CO str.), 1587 (CC str.), 1489 (NN), 1147 (CO str.), 748 (CBr str ); 1H NMR (CDCl3, δppm, 400 MHz): 7.54–7.72 (m, 3H, Ar H), 2.44 (s, 3H, ArCH3), 11.49 (sb. 1H, OH), 11.87 (sb, 1H, COOH), 6.86 (d, 1H, salicylic H-3), 7.86 (d, 1H, salicylic H-4), 8.28 (s, 1H, salicylic H-6); LC–MS (% area); 100; m/z; 333.03 (M-1); Analysis for C14H11BrN2O3: Calcd % C, 50.17; H, 3.31; N, 8.36; Found %: C, 50.27; H, 3.41; N, 8.56.Brown color powder, yield 85%; Rf 0.7; mp (°C); 256–260, UV–vis (λmax, ethanol): 368 nm; IR (KBr, γ, cm−1): 3410 (OH str.), 2926 (CH str.), 1662 (CO str. of carboxylic group), 1606 (CC str.), 1486 (NN), 1153 (CO str); 1H NMR (DMSO, δppm, 400 MHz): 6.85–7.30 (m, 5H, NC6H5), 2.66 (s, 3H, C-CH3), 3.15 (s, 3H, NCH3), 11.65 (sb. 1H, OH), 12.17 (sb, 1H, COOH), 7.32 (d, 1H, salicylic H-3), 7.41 (d, 1H, salicylic H-4), 7.87 (s, 1H, salicylic H-6); LC–MS (% area); 39.20; m/z; 353.07 (M+1); Analysis for C18H16N4O4: Calcd % C, 61.36; H, 4.58; N, 15.90; Found % C, 61.46; H, 4.38; N, 15.87.Black color powder; yield 95%; Rf 0.7; mp (°C); 286–290, UV–vis (λmax, ethanol): 360 nm; IR (KBr, γ, cm−1): 3481 (OH str.), 1692 (CO str.), 1608 (CC str.), 1493 (NN), 1180 (CO str.); 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, δppm, 400 MHz): 8.13–8.41 (m, 4H, Ar H), 11.33 (sb. 1H, OH), 12.54 (sb, 1H, COOH), 7.33 (d, 1H, salicylic H-3), 8.11 (d, 1H, salicylic H-4), 8.29 (s, 1H, salicylic H-6); LC–MS (% area); 100; m/z; 285.00 (M-2); Analysis for C14H10N2O5: Calcd % C, 58.74; H, 3.52; N, 9.79; Found % C, 58.77; H, 3.12; N, 9.49.Black color powder; yield 73%; Rf 0.8; mp (°C); 227–230; UV–vis (λmax, ethanol): 370 nm; IR (KBr, γ, cm−1): 3461 (OH str.), 3138 (NH str.), 2922 (CH2 str.), 1668 (CO str.), 1614 (CC str.), 1473 (NN), 1315, 1170 (SO2 str.SO2NH), 928 (SN str.); 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, δppm, 400 MHz): 8.02–8.34 (m, 4H, Ar H), 11.69 (sb. 1H, OH), 12.11 (sb, 1H, COOH), 11.12 (s, 1H, SO2NH), 2.30 (s, 3H, CH3), 6.17 (s, 1H, isoxazolyl H-4), 7.00 (d, 1H, salicylic H-3), 7.97 (d, 1H, salicylic H-4), 8.34 (s, 1H, salicylic H-6); LC–MS (% area); 100; m/z; 403.04 (M+1); Analysis for C17H14N4O6S: Calcd % C, 50.74; H, 3.51; N, 13.92; S, 7.97; Found %: C, 50.54; H, 3.55; N, 13.96; S, 7.89.The above newly synthesized azosalicylic acid congeners were investigated over different microbial strains viz. Escherichia coli (MTCC 614), Salmonella enterica ser. typhi (MTCC 773), Salmonella enterica typhimurium (MTCC 98), Salmonella enterica paratyphi (MTCC 3220), Shigella flexneri (MTCC 1457), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 1035), Vibrio cholera (MTCC 3906), Micrococcus luteus (MTCC 1809), Klebsiella pneumoniae (MTCC 109), Bacillus circulans (MTCC 490), Streptococcus mitis (MTCC 2695), Aspergillus niger (MTCC 9933), Candida albicans (MTCC 3017), Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton rubrum, sourced from the Institute of Microbial Technology and Gene bank (IMTECH), Chandigarh, India. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis strain hswx88 [12] were isolated in the Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Division of the University Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utkal University. Freshly subcultured microorganisms were used. Ampicillin and Fluconazole were used as reference antibiotics.The antimicrobial activities of the novel azosalicylic acid congeners (4a–4h) were performed by agar well diffusion method using sterile molten nutrient agar (antibacterial activity) and Sabouraud dextrose agar (antifungal activity) [13]. The solidified mediums were inoculated and punched in to wells of 6 mm diameter. Each well was filled with stock solution of test and reference compounds (1 µg/µL concentration) of definite volume and incubated for 24 h and 72 h for bacterial and fungal strains respectively at 37 °C. The compounds showing significant activity against most of the bacterial strains were subjected to investigation of their activity against different fungal strains. The diameter of zone of inhibition was measured using the Hi-Antibiotic Zone Scale (Hi-Media).One milligram per milliliter stock solution of synthesized compounds and reference antibiotic was prepared using 10% DMF solution. Further, five different concentrations (500–31.25 µg/mL) were prepared by serial dilution method. The different concentrations for respective test compounds were loaded into the wells made on bacterial inoculated mediums and incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the test compounds that inhibited the visible growth on agar medium. After incubation, minimum inhibitory concentration was determined [14].In this work, female Wistar rats of 180–200 g (for acute toxicity study) and Swiss albino mice 25–30 g (analgesic evaluation) of either sex of appropriate age were used. The experiments were carried out under the guidelines of Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee with registration number 1171/C/08/CPCSEA and Ref. No. 60/SPS/IAEC/SOAU.Acute Oral Toxicity study was performed on female Wistar rats to establish the safety dose of the synthesized compounds. OECD guideline No.420 (2000) for Acute Oral Toxicity-Fixed Dose Procedure was followed (sighting study and main study) for a period of 14 days to study the acute toxic symptoms and the behavioral changes within the animals.Albino mice of appropriate weight of either sex were kept under controlled conditions of light and temperature. The animals were divided into 10 groups, each carrying 6 animals. Group-1 was treated as control, group-2 served as positive control where they were administered with standard acetyl salicylic acid at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight, (intra-peritoneal). Animals from groups 3 to 10 were provided with test (4e, 4f, 4g and 4h) compounds respectively at a dose level of 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight orally. Thirty minutes after the administration of acetyl salicylic acid in group 2 and 1 h after administration of test drugs in groups 3–10, all the groups were administered with 0.6% v/v acetic acid solution at a dose level of 1 mL/100 g of body weight (intra-peritoneal) [15]. The onset of writhing was noted. Finally, the percentage of analgesic activity was calculated.%Analgesic activity=Mean writhing count(Control group−Treated group)/Mean writhing count of control group×100.The reaction time was expressed as mean ± SEM. The statistical analysis was done by one way-ANOVA followed by Dunnett's t-test.The free radical scavenging activity of novel azosalicylic acid analogs (4e–4h) was measured by DPPH method with some modification [13]. The reaction mixture of synthesized compounds at different concentration aliquots was taken and the volume was adjusted up to 3 mL with methanol. To this mixture 1 mL of 0.1 mM solution of DPPH in methanol was added. The mixture was kept in the dark for 30 min. The free radical scavenging activity of synthesized compounds was compared with standard Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT). Optical density was measured at 517 nm and the inhibition of concentration was calculated. One milliliter of 0.1 mM of methanolic solution of DPPH and 3 mL of methanol was considered as control.%of inhibition=[(Acont−Atest)/Acont]×100where Acont is the absorbance of control and Atest is the absorbance of the test sample. The sample concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC50) was determined. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate and IC50 values were expressed as mean ± SD.For the computational approach by tools of bioinformatics, docking is employed for locating a suitable or leading synthetic compound against a particular target retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB), New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) of K. pneumoniae with PDB ID: 3SPU as a bacterial target protein [16] and cyclooxygenase-2 of Mos musculus with PDB ID: 1CX2 as an analgesic target protein [7] for docking study. The structures of the synthesized compounds (4e, 4f, 4g, and 4h) are prepared by using Chem Draw ultra 10.0 and converted from .mol file format to pdb format for docking. In silico protein–ligand interaction of the newly synthesized compounds (4e, 4f, 4g, and 4h) was investigated individually using Arugus Lab 4.0 docking software. The protein–ligand interaction was carried out by Discovery studio Visualizer 3.1 software. The resulting score obtained by molecular docking predicts the strongest binders.The observed data on zone of inhibitions were subjected to one way-analysis of variance. The mean zone of inhibition for each compound on each strain was compared with the reference antibiotic through Dunnett's Post Hoc test (https://www.statsdodo.com/SSizAOV_Pgm.php). The test of significance was done at 5% level of type one error. The research hypothesis was ‘the zone of inhibition for test compound was higher than the reference antibiotic against the hypothesis of no difference (null hypotheses)’, which states that there is no significant difference between the zone of inhibition of the test compound and the reference antibiotics.A minimum sample size of five was calculated taking probability of type 1 error (d) = 0.05, Power (1-β) = 0.8, Number of groups 13 within group SD = 2. However a sample size of six has been taken in the study for each compound against each strain.
