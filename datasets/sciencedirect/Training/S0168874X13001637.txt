@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a novel Timoshenko beam element based on the framework of strain gradient elasticity theory for the analysis of the static bending, free vibration and buckling behaviors of Timoshenko microbeams. The element proposed is a two-node element which has 6-DOF (degrees of freedom) at each node considering both bending and stretching deformations, and 4-DOF considering only bending deformation. Unlike the classical Timoshenko beam element, the current element satisfies the C0 continuity and C1 weak continuity and contains three material length scale parameters to capture the size effect. Finite element formulations are derived by utilizing the corresponding weak form equations. Convergence, shear locking and comparison studies are carried out to examine the reliability and accuracy of the numerical solutions. The shear locking study shows that the present beam element is free of shear locking. Besides, it is established that there is a good agreement between the present results with the results in existing literature. To further illustrate the applicability and accuracy of the new Timoshenko beam element, the static bending, free vibration and buckling problems of microbeams with various boundary conditions are covered by the analysis. The results show that such small size effects are significant when the beam thickness is small, but become negligible with increasing beam thickness. Some results are believed to be the first known in the open literature and can be used as a benchmark for further studies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Microscale and nanoscale devices systems have attracted the attention of many researchers due to their superior mechanical, chemical and electronic properties and consequently wide potential applications in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and atomic force microscopes (AFMS) [1–3]. Experiments on the metals [4,5] and polymers [6] have shown that the size effect cannot be ignored when the characteristic length of elastic and plastic deformations is typically on the order of microns. For example, Fleck et al. [4] found that the shear strength increased by a factor of three as the wire diameter decreased from 170μm to12μm in the micro-torsion test of thin copper wires. In the micro-bending test of thin nickel beams, Stolken and Evans [5] observed that the normalized bending hardening had a great increase when the beam thickness decreased from 100μm to12.5μm. Lam et al. [6] showed that the bending rigidity increased about 2.4 times as the beam thickness reduced from 115μm to 20μm in the micro-bending testing of epoxy polymeric beams. The latest experimental studies can be found in the literatures published by Liu et al. [7–9]. It is evident from these experimental studies that the material properties of microscale structures are size-dependent, and hence the size effect must be taken into account in theoretical and experimental studies.It is generally known that the classical continuum theory does not involve the size effect in microscale structures. To overcome this shortcoming, new higher-order continuum theories, such as couple stress elasticity theory [10–12], strain gradient elasticity theory [6], surface elasticity theory [13], micropolar elasticity theory [14,15], and plastic strain gradient theory [4,16,17], have been proposed and employed to study the mechanical behavior of microscale structures. As we all know, beams are the critical components extensively used in MEMS, NEMS and AFMS where the structural size is in micron or sub-micron scale, and therefore the static and dynamic behaviors of microbeams have received considerable attention in the literature. By using a nonlocal constitutive relation initiated in [14,15], various nonlocal beam models for analyzing static, buckling and dynamic problems have been proposed in the academic literature (e.g., [18–22]). Considering the difficulties in determining the microstructure related length scale parameters, Yang et al. [23] first modified the classical couple stress theory [12,13] and proposed the modified couple stress theory involving only one additional material length scale parameter. Based on the modified couple stress theory, the static and dynamic problems of microscale Bernoulli–Euler beams [24–26], Timoshenko beams [27–30], Reddy beams [31], Kirchhoff plates [32–35], Mindlin plates [36,37], Reddy plates [38,39] and nanoshells [40] have been studied thoroughly by researchers. Note that the above works only studied the microbeams made of homogeneous materials. For size-dependent microbeams composed of functionally graded materials (FGM) on the other hand, Asghari et al. [41,42], Ke and Wang [43], Reddy [44], Ke et al. [45], Şimşek et al. [46] and Akgöz and Civalek [47] investigated the static bending, linear vibration, dynamic stability and nonlinear vibration of FG Bernoulli-Euler and Timoshenko microbeams. Although the first-order shear deformation theory provides sufficiently accurate result for moderately thick FG microbeams, it is not convenient to use due to requiring a shear correction factor. To avoid the use of the shear correction factor, Salamat-talab et al. [48] and Nateghi et al. [49] utilized modified couple stress theory to model the static, vibration and buckling behaviors of FG microbeams based on a third-order shear deformation theory. Şimşek and Reddy [50,51] proposed a unified higher-order beam theory to examine the static bending, free vibration and buckling behaviors of FG microbeams based on the modified couple stress theory. Given space limitations, the research work related to the modeling and simulation of FG microplates with modified couple stress are not mentioned here.It should be pointed out that the afore-cited contributions based on the modified couple stress consider rotation gradient tensor only and other gradient tensors are neglected. As one of the most successful higher-order continuum theories, strain gradient elasticity theory proposed by Lam et al. [6] introduces three material length scale parameters to characterize the dilatation gradient tensor, the deviatoric stretch gradient tensor and the symmetric rotation gradient tensor. The higher-order stress tensor work-conjugate to the new higher-order deformation metrics and the corresponding constitutive relations are defined. It is worth noting that the modified couple stress theory can be viewed as a special case of the strain gradient elasticity theory when the first two of material length scale parameters are taken to be zero. This theory has been employed by many researchers to analyze the static and dynamic problems of microscale structures. For instance, Kong et al. [52] and Wang et al. [53] investigated static bending and free vibration behaviors of Bernoulli–Euler and Timoshenko homogeneous microbeams, respectively. The nonlinear Bernoulli–Euler and Timoshenko homogeneous microbeams have been respectively developed by Kahrobaiyan et al. [54] and Ramezani [55]. Akgöz and Civalek [56–58] employed strain gradient elasticity and modified couple stress theories to investigate the bending, buckling and free vibrations of Bernoulli–Euler microbeams. Furthermore, they proposed a new size-dependent sinusoidal shear deformation beam model based on strain gradient elasticity theory [59]. Kahrobaiyan et al. [60] developed a FG strain gradient Bernoulli-Euler beam model. The linear and nonlinear vibration characteristics of strain gradient Timoshenko microbeams made of functionally graded materials (FGMs) were studied by Ansari et al. [61,62]. Ansari et al. [63] also investigate the postbuckling behavior of FG microbeams subjected to thermal loads. Sahmani and Ansari [64] studied the free vibration behaviors of FG microplates based on strain gradient elasticity and higher-order shear deformable plate theory. Zhang et al. [65] presented a FGM size-dependent curved microbeam model based on nth-order shear deformation and strain gradient elasticity theories.Compared with the conventional elasticity theory, higher-order continuum theories are more complicated, and heretofore the analytical solutions are available for those microstructure elements (i.e., microbars, microplates and microshells) with simple geometric shapes and boundary conditions only. As is well known, a powerful numerical technique, e.g., the finite element method, is very useful for implementation of the latter theory. However, the existing finite element programs are not able to deal with this type of problems. To the best knowledge of authors, however, only limited investigations have been reported in the open literatures for the application of finite element method to predict the mechanical responses of microstructure elements based on the size-dependent continuum theories. For example, Phadikar and Pradhan [66] presented a finite element formulation for nonlocal elastic nanobeams and nanoplates based on nonlocal elasticity theory [14,15]. Pradhan [67] proposed a finite element formulation for nonlocal elastic Bernoulli-Euler beam and Timoshenko beam theories. Kahrobaiyan et al. [68,69] employed modified couple stress theory to develop a size-dependent beam element which can be used to predict the size dependence observed in microbeams. By using finite element method initiated in Ref. [66], Pradhan and Mandal [70] analyzed the vibration, buckling and bending of carbon nanotubes in thermal environments based on the nonlocal Timoshenko beam theory. Zhang et al. [71] developed a non-classical Mindin plate element based on the framework of the modified couple stress theory for analyzing the static bending, free vibration and buckling behaviors of size-dependent Mindlin micro-plates. The element proposed is a four-node rectangular element which has 15-DOF (degrees of freedom) at each node by considering both bending and stretching deformations, and 9-DOF with only considering bending deformation. This element satisfies the C0 continuity and C1 weak continuity and contains a material length scale parameter.In the present study, a non-classical Timoshenko beam element is developed based on the strain gradient theory to predict mechanical behaviors of the micro-/nano-scale beams. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the strain gradient elastic theory is first reviewed, and which are followed by the basic equations of Timoshenko microbeams and the weak form formulations based on the reviewed theory, respectively. Subsequently, the finite element formulations based on the strain gradient elastic theory are in detail deduced by using the corresponding weak form formulations. The explicit forms of linear stiffness, mass and geometrical nonlinear matrices are given in the Appendix. To illustrate the newly developed beam element, the static bending, free vibration and buckling problems of Timoshenko microbeams are investigated thoroughly in Section 4. Some of the present results are compared with the previously published results to establish the validity of the present approach. The paper concludes in Section 5 with a summary.According to the strain gradient theory proposed by Lam et al. [6], strain energy density is a function of dilatation gradient tensor and deviatoric stretch gradient tensor in addition to the symmetric rotation gradient tensor. To characterize these tensors, three independent material length scale parameters in addition to two classical material constants are introduced to analyze isotropic linear elastic materials. It then follows that the strain energy in a deformed isotropic linear elastic material occupying region Ω is given by(1)U=12∫Ω(σijεij+piγi+τijk(1)ηijk(1)+mij(s)χij(s))dΩwhere the deformed measures as follows: strain tensor εij, dilatation gradient tensor γi, deviatoric stretch gradient tensorηijk(1), and symmetric rotation gradient tensorχij(s), are defined as(2)εij=12(ui,j+uj,i)(3)γi=εmm,i(4)ηijk(1)=ηijks−15(δijηmmks+δjkηmmis+δjkηmmjs)(5)χijs=14(eipqεqj,p+ejpqεqi,p)where a comma followed by a subscript denotes differentiation with respect to the subscript (e.g., ui,j=∂ui/∂xj). In what it follows, unless other stated, the Latin indices take the values 1, 2, 3. uirepresents the displacement vector, εmmis the dilatation strain, andηijksis the symmetric part of the second order displacement gradient tensor defined by(6)ηijks=13(ui,jk+uj,ki+uk,ij)δijand eijkare the Knocker symbol and the alternate symbol respectively. Here it should be pointed out that the index notation will always be used with repeated indices denoting summation 1–3.The corresponding stress measures, respectively, are given by the following constitutive relations:(7)σij=λεmmδij+2μεij(8)τijk(1)=2μl12τijk(1)(9)mijs=2μl22χijs(10)pi=2μl02γiwhere l0, l1 and l2 are the additional independent material length scale parameters associated with dilatation gradients, deviatoric stretch gradients and symmetry rotation gradients, respectively. The parameters λ and μ appeared in the constitutive equation of the classical stress σijdenote the bulk and shear modules, respectively which are given as(11)λ=Eν(1+ν)(1−2ν),μ=E2(1+ν)Consider a straight Timoshenko microbeam subjected to distributed loads fw(x,t), fu(x,t) and fϕ(x,t) through the longitudinal axis x of the beam, as shown inFig. 1, where the xy-plane is coincident with the geometrical mid-plane of the un-deformed beam. The displacements based on the Timoshenko beam theory can be expressed as(12)ux(x,y)=u(x,y)−zϕ(x,y),uy(x,y)=0uz(x,y)=w(x,y)where u and w are, respectively, the components of the displacement vector of the corresponding point (x, y, 0) on the beam mid-plane at time t, and ϕ is the rotation angle of a transverse normal about the y-axis (see Fig. 1).By substitution Eq. (12) into Eq. (2), the nonzero components of the strain tensor are given as(13)εxx=∂u∂x−z∂ϕ∂x,εxz=12(∂w∂x−ϕ)Using Eqs. (3) and (13) then leads to(14)γx=∂2u∂x2−z∂2ϕ∂x2,γz=−∂ϕ∂xSubstituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (5) yields(15)χxys=χyxs=−14(∂2w∂x2+∂ϕ∂x)By means of Eqs. (4), (6), and (12), the nonzero components of deviatoric stretch gradient tensorηijk(1)can be achieved(16)ηxxx(1)=25(∂2u∂x2−z∂2ϕ∂x2),ηxzx(1)=ηzxx(1)=ηxxz(1)=415(∂2w∂x2−2∂ϕ∂x),ηyyx(1)=ηzzx(1)=ηxyy(1)=ηyxy(1)=ηxzz(1)=ηzxz(1)=−15(∂2u∂x2−z∂2ϕ∂x2),ηyzy(1)=ηzyy(1)=ηyyz(1)=115(−∂2w∂x2+2∂ϕ∂x),ηzzz(1)=15(−∂2w∂x2+2∂ϕ∂x).The non-zero stresses σijare obtained by substituting Eq. (13) into Eq. (7)(17)σxx=(λ+2μ)(∂u∂x−z∂ϕ∂x),σyy=σzz=λ(∂u∂x−z∂ϕ∂x),σxz=μ(∂w∂x−ϕ).It is observed that σxzdepends only on 1-direction. To take the non-uniformity of the shear strain into account over the beam cross-section, a correction factor ks, which depends on the shape of beam cross-section, is multiplied into the stress component σxzas the following relation:(18)σxz=ksμ(∂w∂x−ϕ)The use of Eq. (14) in Eq. (10) then leads to(19)px=2μl02(∂2u∂x2−z∂2ϕ∂x2),pz=−2μl02∂ϕ∂xAnd by inserting Eq. (15) into Eq. (9), the non-zero higher-order stressesmijsare(20)mxys=myxs=−12μl22(∂2w∂x2+∂ϕ∂x)Using Eq. (16) in Eq. (8) then leads to(21)τxxx(1)=45μl12(∂2u∂x2−z∂2ϕ∂x2),τxzx(1)=τzxx(1)=τxxz(1)=815μl12(∂2w∂x2−2∂ϕ∂x),τyyx(1)=τzzx(1)=τxyy(1)=τyxy(1)=τxzz(1)=τzxz(1)=−25μl12(∂2u∂x2−z∂2ϕ∂x2),τyzy(1)=τzyy(1)=τyyz(1)=215μl12(−∂2w∂x2+2∂ϕ∂x),τzzz(1)=25μl12(−∂2w∂x2+2∂ϕ∂x).Hamilton's principle is used herein to derive the equations of motion. The principle can be stated in an analytical form as [36](22)∫t1t2(δU+δW−δK)dt=0where δU is the virtual strain energy, δW is the virtual work done by external forces, and δK is the virtual kinetic energy.The first variation of the total strain energy in the Timoshenko microbeam on the time interval [t1,t2] is (see Eq. (1))(23)δ∫t1t2Udt=∫t1t2∫Ω(σijδεij+piδγi+τijk(1)δηijk(1)+mij(s)δχij(s))dΩdtNote that the volume integral of a sufficiently smooth function F(x,y,z,t) over the region Ω can be expressed as(24)∫ΩF(x,y,z,t)dΩ=∫A∫0LF(x,y,z,t)dxdAwhere A and L are the cross-sectional areas and length of the microbeam, respectively.The first integral on the right-hand side of Eq. (23) can be determined as, with the help of Green's theorem,(25)∫t1t2∫Ω(σijδεij)+Piδγi+τijk(1)δηijk(1)+mij(s)δχij(s)=∫t1t2∫0L(f(u)δu+f(w)δw+f(ϕ)δϕ)dxdt+∫t1t2(N(u)(0)δu+N(w)(0)δw+N(ϕ)(0)+N(u)(1)∂δu∂x+N(w)(1)∂δw∂x+N(ϕ)(1)∂δϕ∂x)|x=0x=Ldtwhere(26)f(u)=−∂Nxx(0)∂x+∂2Px(0)∂x2+15∂2∂x2(2Txxx(0)−2Txyy(0)−Tyyx(0)−2Txzz(0)−Tzzx(0))(27)f(w)=−∂Nxz(0)∂x+115∂2∂x2(4Txxz(0)+8Txzx(0)−3Tzzz(0)−2Tyzy(0)−Tyyz(0))−12∂2Mxy(0)∂x2(28)f(ϕ)=−Nxz(0)+∂Nxx(1)∂x−∂2Px(1)∂x2+15∂2∂x2(2Txyy(1)+Tyyx(1)−2Txxx(1)+Tzzx(1)+2Txzz(1))+215∂∂x(4Txxz(0)−3Tzzz(0)−2Tyzy(0)+8Txzx(0)−Tyyz(0))+12∂Mxy(0)∂x(29)N(u)(0)=15∂∂x(Tyyx(0)+Tzzx(0)+2Txyy(0)+2Txzz(0)−2Txxx(0))−∂Px(0)∂x+Nxx(0)(30)N(u)(1)=15(2Txxx(0)−Tyyxv−Tzzx(0)−2Txyy(0)−2Txzz(0))+Px(0)(31)N(w)(0)=115∂∂x(2Tyzy(0)−4Txxz(0)+Tyyz(0)+3Tzzz(0)−8Txzx(0))+12∂Mxy(0)∂x+Nxz(0)(32)N(w)(1)=115(4Txxz(0)−2Tyzy(0)−Tyyz(0)−3Tzzz(0)+8Txzx(0))−12Mxy(0)(33)N(ϕ)(0)=15∂∂x(2Txxx(1)−Tyyx(1)−Tzzx(1)−2Txyy(1)−2Txzz(1))+∂Px(1)∂x+215(3Tzzz(0)−4Txxz(0)−8Txzx(0)+Tyyz(0)+2Tyzy(0))−Nxx(1)−12Mxy(0)(34)N(ϕ)(1)=15(Tzzx(1)+Tyyx(1)+2Txyy(1)+2Txzz(1)−2Txxx(1))−Px(1)where(35)Nxx(0)=∫AσxxdA,Nxx(1)=∫AσxxzdA,Nxz(0)=∫AσxzdA.(36)Px(0)=∫ApxdA,Px(1)=∫ApxzdA,Pz(0)=∫ApzdA.(37)Mxy(0)=∫AmxysdA.(38)Txxx(0)=∫Aτxxx(1)dA,Txxx(1)=∫Aτxxx(1),zzdA,Txzx(0)=Tzxx(0)=Txxz(0)=∫Aτxzx(1)dA,Tyyx(0)=Tzzx(0)=Txyy(0)=Tyxy(0)=Txzz(0)=Tzxz(0)=∫Aτyyx(1)dA,Tyyx(1)=Tzzx(1)=Txyy(1)=Tyxy(1)=Txzz(1)=Tzxz(1)=∫Aτyyx(1)zdA,Tyzy(0)=Tzyy(0)=Tyyz(0)=∫Aτyzy(1)dA,Tzzz(0)=∫Aτzzz(1)dA.The kinetic energy of the Timoshenko microbeam is given by(39)K=12∫0L[m0(∂u∂t)2+m0(∂w∂t)2+m2(∂ϕ∂t)2]dxwhere(40)m0=ρA,m2=ρJ,J=∫Az2dAThe first variation of the kinetic energy, on the time interval [t1,t2] is determined to be(41)∫t1t2δKdt=−∫t1t2∫0L(m0∂2u∂t2δu+m0∂2w∂t2δw+m2∂2ϕ∂t2δϕ)dxIn reaching Eq. (41), it has been assumed that the initial t=t1 and final t=t2 configurations of the Timoshenko microbeam are prescribed so that the virtual displacements vanish at t=t1 and t=t2.The virtual work done by the forces applied on the microbeam on the time interval [t1,t2] can be expressed as(42)∫t1t2δWdt=∫t1t2∫0L(fuδu+fwδw+fϕδϕ)dxdt+∫t1t2(Nu(0)δu+Nu(1)∂δu∂x+Nw(0)δw+Nw(1)∂δw∂x+Nϕ(0)δϕ+Nϕ(1)∂δϕ∂x)|x=0x=Ldtwhere fuand fware the x and z components of the body forces per unit length, respectively; fϕis the body couple per unit length;Nu(0),Nu(1),Nw(0),Nw(1),Nϕ(0)andNϕ(1)are external forces respectively work conjugate to δu, ∂δu/∂x, δw, ∂δw/∂x, δϕ and ∂δϕ/∂x.Substituting Eqs. (25), (41) and (42) into Eq. (22), and then setting the coefficient δu, δw and δϕ to zero, lead to the following governing equations:(43)δu:−∂Nxx(0)∂x+∂2Px(0)∂x2+15∂2∂x2(2Txxx(0)−3Tyyx(0)−3Tzzx(0))−fu+m0∂2u∂t2=0(44)δw:−∂Nxz(0)∂x+15∂2∂x2(4Txzx(0)−Tzzz(0)−Tyyz(0))−12∂2Mxy(0)∂x2−fw+m0∂2w∂t2=0(45)δϕ:−Nxz(0)+∂Nxx(1)∂x−∂2Px(1)∂x2+15∂2∂x2(3Tyyx(1)−2Txxx(1)+3Tzzx(1))+25∂∂x(4Txzx(0)−Tzzz(0)−Tyyz(0))+12∂Mxy(0)∂x−fϕ+m2∂2ϕ∂t2=0The corresponding boundary conditions at the beam ends (x=0 and x=L) can be obtained as(46)eitherδu=0or15∂∂x(3Tyyx(0)+3Tzzx(0)−2Txxx(0))−∂Px(0)∂x+Nxx(0)−Nu(0)=0(47)either∂δu∂x=0or15(2Txxx(0)−3Tyyx(0)−3Tzzx(0))+Px(0)−Nu(1)=0(48)eitherδw=0or15∂∂x(Tyyz(0)+Tzzz(0)−4Txxz(0))+12∂Mxy(0)∂x+Nxz(0)−Nw(0)=0(49)either∂δw∂x=0or15(4Txxz(0)−Tyyz(0)−Tzzz(0))−12Mxy(0)−Nw(1)=0(50)eitherδϕ=0or15∂∂x(2Txxx(1)−3Tyyx(1)−3Tzzx(1))+∂Px(1)∂x+25(Tzzz(0)−4Txxz(0)+Tyyz(0))−Nxx(1)−12Mxy(0)−Nϕ(0)=0(51)either∂δϕ∂x=0or15(3Tzzx(1)+3Tyyx(1)−2Txxx(1))−Px(1)−Nϕ(1)=0Substituting Eqs.

(56)–(58). From the above equations, we can see that the second-order derivative of transverse deflection w, rotation ϕ and axial displacement u are contained in the weak form equations, unlike those based on the classical Timoshenko beam theory that only contains the first derivative of those generalized displacements. Consequently, to guarantee the integrability of weak form equations, the C1 continuity of the generalized displacement functions is required. However, the classical Timoshenko beam element needs C0 continuity requirement only, and lacks material length scale parameters in the constitutive relation. Therefore, it is desirable to construct a non-classical Timoshenko beam element that satisfies theC1continuity requirement and involves additional material length scale parameters to capture the microstructure size effect.In this paper, we present a 2-node Timoshenko beam element. The proposed element has 6-DOF at each node and relax the continuity condition more loosely, which satisfy the C0 continuity and C1 weak continuity conditions and contains three material length scale parameters.It is clearly observed from Eqs. (52) to (54) that the axial displacement u is uncoupled with the transverse displacement w and the rotation ϕ can therefore be obtained separately based on prescribed boundary conditions and suitable initial conditions. To construct the mathematical form of these displacement functions, we assume that the solutions to the homogeneous differential equations can be expressed as exponential functions(59)u=Ueβx,ϕ=Ψepx,w=WepxAs I know this approach has appeared in Refs. [72,73,68] respectively for the macroscopical straight Timoshenko beam element, the macroscopical curved Timoshenko beam element and the strain gradient Bernoulli-Euler beam. Here, it should be pointed that the axial displacement u is uncoupled with the transverse displacement w and the rotation ϕ.Substitution of Eq. (59) into Eqs. (52)–(54) and dividing through by the exponential function gives three homogeneous algebraic equations for the three coefficients U, Ψ and Win Eqs.

(63) and (64) can be given as follows:(65)β1=β2=0,β3=k2/k1β4=−k2/k1(66)p1=p2=p3=p4=0,p6=−p5=−22d1+d2k3k7,p8=−p7=−22d1−d2k3k7where(67)d1=−k62+k3k5+k4k7d2=k64−2k62k3k5−2k62k4k7+k32k52−2k3k5k4k7+k42k72−4k3k72k5+8k3k7k5k6The first and most obvious solution for β=0 and that means that a constant value is a solution to the differential equation related with axial displacement u. But since β is squared that means a multiplicity and requires that the linear polynomial x must be also a solutions. The second family of solutions is based on the solution for β according to the expression inside the brackets in Eq. (63). This indicates that the general solution to the axial displacement function u consists of hyperbolic functions (sinh and cosh). Similarly, the general expression of displacement functions ϕ and w also can be reasoned based on Eq. (64).Therefore, the accurate solutions of u,ϕ and w must be of the following form:(68a)u=a0+a1x+a3cosh(β3x)+a4sinh(β3x)(68b)ϕ=b0+b1x+b2x2+b3x3+b4cosh(p5x)+b5sinh(p5x)+b6cosh(p7x)+b7sinh(p7x)(68c)w=c0+c1x+c2x2+c3x3+c4cosh(p5x)+c5sinh(p5x)+c6cosh(p7x)+c7sinh(p7x)where ai(i=1, 2, 3 and 4), biand ciare undetermined coefficients (i=1, 2, …, 8).When the size effect is suppressed by letting l0=l1=l2=0, Eqs. (68a)–(68c) will reduce to the accurate displacement functions of classical Timoshenko beams, i.e.(69a)u=a0+a1x(69b)ϕ=b0+b1x+b2x2+b3x3(69c)w=c0+c1x+c2x2+c3x3By substituting Eqs. (69b) and (69c) into the governing equations of classical Timoshenko beam (see also Ref. [72]) and requiring these coefficients to vanish identically we can obtain four constraints which will leave exactly four independent coefficients. These independent coefficients will later on have to be expressed in terms of the node parameters (i.e. node displacement and rotation). Finally, the accurate shape functions ϕ and w given by Kosmatka [72] can be recovered here. The accurate shape functions for the present strain gradient Timoshenko beam also can be obtained in the same way, however, and the detailed formulas are lengthy and rather complicated and will not be discussed. In this case, the shape functions obtained are associated with material properties and length scale parameters. This characteristic also can be found in the strain gradient Bernoulli–Euler beam element developed by Kahrobaiyan et al. [68].On the other hand, the Timoshenko beam finite element with linear interpolation of both w and ϕ is the simplest, i.e.(70)ϕ=b0+b1x,w=c0+c1xEq. (70) is the equivalent of the case which considered the double zero eigenvalues of Eq. (64) only. Obviously, Eq. (70) does meet the equilibrium equation for non-zero coefficients b0, b1, c0 and c1. Those coefficients just need to be satisfied four boundary conditions at the ends of the beam.In view of the number of nodal parameters and notice that p is quadruple zero roots, the simplest form of the displacement functions for strain gradient Timoshenko beam can be assumed as(71a)u=a0+a1x+a3cosh(β3x)+a4sinh(β3x)(71b)ϕ=b0+b1x+b2x2+b3x3(71c)w=c0+c1x+c2x2+c3x3where ai(i=0, 1, 2 or 3) are the coefficients that can be determined by four simultaneous equations linking the values of u and its first derivative u,xat the nodes when the coordinates take their appropriate values, biand cican be obtained with the similar procedure as ai.By using the displacement boundary conditions at the beam's ends, the resulting explicit form of the shape functions are given as(72)N1(u)=1β3Lsinh(β3L)+2−2cosh(β3L){[−cosh(β3L)+β3Lsinh(β3L)+1]−sinh(β3L)β3x+sinh(β3L)sinh(β3x)+[1−cosh(β3L)]cosh(β3x)},N2(u)=1β3[β3Lsinh(β3L)+2−2cosh(β3L)]{[Lβ3cosh(β3L)−sinh(β3L)]+β3[1−cosh(β3L)]x+[Lβ3sinh(β3L)+1−cosh(β3L)]sinh(β3x)+[sinh(β3L)−Lβ3cosh(β3L)]cosh(β3x)},N3(u)=1β3Lsinh(β3L)+2−2cosh(β3L){1−cosh(β3L)+β3sinh(β3L)x−sinh(β3L)sinh(β3x)+[cosh(β3L)−1]cosh(β3x)},N4(u)=1β3[β3Lsinh(β3L)+2−2cosh(β3L)]{sinh(β3L)−β3L+[1−cosh(β3L)]β3x+[cosh(β3L)−1]sinh(β3x)+[Lβ3−sinh(β3L)]cosh(β3x)}.(73)N1(ϕ)=1−3(xL)2+2(xL)3,N2(ϕ)=[xL−2(xL)2+(xL)3]L,N3(ϕ)=3(xL)2−2(xL)3N4(ϕ)=[(xL)3−(xL)2]L.(74)N1(w)=N1(ϕ),N2(w)=N2(ϕ),N3(w)=N3(ϕ),N4(w)=N4(ϕ).The element displacement will, as usual, be given by a listing of nodal displacements(75)u=Nudu,ϕ=Nϕdϕ,w=Nwdwwhere(76)Nu=[N1(u)N2(u)N3(u)N4(u)],du=[u1(u,x)1u2(u,x)2]T,Nϕ=[N1(ϕ)N2(ϕ)N3(ϕ)N4(ϕ)],dϕ=[ϕ1(ϕ,x)1ϕ2(ϕ,x)2]T,Nw=[N1(w)N2(w)N3(w)N4(w)],dw=[w1(w,x)1w2(w,x)2]T.Using Eq. (75) into the weak form equations of Timoshenko microbeam (i.e., (56), (57) and (58)), respectively, the finite element formulations for the static bending, free vibration and buckling problems can be obtained.For static analysis, the formulation of Timoshenko microbeams can then be obtained as(77)Kd=F,for free vibration analysis, it can be rewritten as(78)(K−ω2M)d=0and, for buckling analysis, one can write,(79)(K−FcrKg)d=0,whereKis the global stiffness matrix,Fis the global force vector,Mis the global mass matrix,Kgis the global geometrical stiffness matrix. ω and Fcr=σxx0Aare the natural frequency, and the critical buckling load, respectively. The above global matrices and global force vector can be obtained by assembling each corresponding element matrix and load vector, respectively.The element stiffness matrixKe, element load vectorFe, element mass matrixMeand element geometrical stiffness matrixKgecan be given as(80)Ke=[KuuKuwKuϕKwuKwwKwϕKϕuKϕwKϕϕ],Me=[MuuMuwMuϕMwuKwwMwϕMϕuMϕwMϕϕ],Fe=[FuFwFϕ],Kge=[Kuug000Kwwg000Kϕϕg].where(81)Kuu=k1(∂2Nu∂x2)T∂2Nu∂x2+k2(∂Nu∂x)T∂Nu∂x,Kuϕ=Kϕu=Kuw=Kwu=0,Kww=k7(∂2Nw∂x2)T∂2Nw∂x2+k5(∂Nw∂x)T∂Nw∂x,KwϕT=Kϕw=−[k6(∂Nϕ∂x)T∂2Nw∂x2+k5(Nϕ)T∂Nw∂x],Kϕϕ=k3(∂2Nϕ∂x2)T∂2Nϕ∂x2+k4(∂Nϕ∂x)T∂Nϕ∂x+k5(Nϕ)TNϕ.(82)Fu=∫0L(Nu)Tfudx+[(Nu)TNu(0)+(∂Nu∂x)TNu(1)]|x=0x=L,Fw=∫0L(Nw)Tfwdx+[(Nw)TNw(0)+(∂Nw∂x)TNw(1)]|x=0x=L,Fϕ=∫0L(Nϕ)Tfϕdx+[(Nϕ)TNϕ(0)+(∂Nϕ∂x)TNϕ(1)]|x=0x=L.(83)Muu=∫0Lm0(Nu)TNudx,Muϕ=Mϕu=Muw=Mwu=0,Mϕϕ=∫0Lm2(Nu)TNudx,Mϕw=Mwϕ=0,Mww=∫0Lm0(Nw)TNwdx.(84)Kuug=∫0LA(∂Nu∂x)T∂Nu∂xdx,Kϕϕg=∫0LJ(∂Nϕ∂x)T∂Nϕ∂xdxKwwg=∫0LA(∂Nw∂x)T∂Nw∂xdx.Since the analytical form of stiffness and mass matrices related to stretching deformation are tedious and complicated, only those matrices concerned bending deformation are listed in Appendix A.From Eq. (81), it is clearly observed that the current Timoshenko beam element based on the strain gradient elastic theory contains three independent additional material length scale parameters, unlike the existing beam element based on the classical Timoshenko beam theory that requires C0 continuity only. Nevertheless, the presence of those length scale parameters enables the incorporation of the material microstructural features in the new element, thereby making it possible to explain the size effect. This will be further demonstrated in Section 4. In addition, the Poisson effect [27,50,53] is involved in Eq. (81), which differs from the existing Timoshenko beam element being negligible. Only for a slender beam with a large aspect ratio, the Poisson effect is secondary and may be neglected by replacing λ+2μ with E, as was done in classical beam theories. For other cases, the Poisson effect will have to be included in order to obtain accurate and reliable results. This will be further illustrated through numerical results to be presented below.For the strain gradient Timoshenko microbeam, it can be seen that the boundary conditions require the specification of the primary (or kinematic) variables δu, ∂δu/∂x, δw, ∂δw/∂x, δϕ and ∂δϕ/∂x or else the secondary (force) variablesNu(0),Nu(1),Nw(1),Nw(1),Nϕ(0)andNϕ(1)equal to zero. As those higher order tractions in Eq. (42) have not special physical meaning, all of them are not considered here.By using Eqs. (35)–(38) and (46)–(51), the boundary conditions of Timoshenko microbeams in terms of the displacements are given as(85)eitherw=0or−Aμ(815l12+14l22)∂3w∂x3+ksμA∂w∂x+Aμ(1615l12−14l22)∂2ϕ∂x2−ksμAϕ−Nw(0)=0(86)either∂w∂x=0orAμ(815l12+14l22)∂2w∂x2−Aμ(1615l12−14l22)∂ϕ∂x=0(87)eitherϕ=0or[μA(3215l12+2l02+14l22)+JA(λ+2μ)]∂ϕ∂x−μA(1615l12−14l22)∂2w∂x2−Jμ(45l12+2l02)∂3ϕ∂x3−Nϕ(0)=0(88)either∂ϕ∂x=0orJμ(2l02+45l12)∂2ϕ∂x2=0(89)eitheru=0orA(λ+2μ)∂u∂x−μA(2l02+45l12)∂3u∂x3−Nu(0)=0(90)either∂u∂x=0orAμ(45l12+2l02)∂2u∂x2=0It is clearly seen from Eqs. (85) to (90) that letting the material length scale parameters l0, l1 and l2 equal to zero, the higher order boundary conditions (i.e. Eqs. (86), (88) and (90)) will automagically disappear and meanwhile the boundary conditions related to those of the classical beam theory are regained. Boundary conditions have to be supplied to all the primary kinematic variables, in this case both the displacements and the displacement derivatives. As in the classical theory this can be accomplished by either prescribing a value of a kinematic variable or prescribing the conjugated traction. For the conjugate pair of displacement and force traction this is standard procedure and will not be elaborated on further. For the displacement derivatives and higher order tractions, this procedure merits a more thorough investigation. Physically, some of the available conditions seem unreasonable when applied to the higher order terms. For instance, a boundary on which displacement derivative is constrained to a non-zero value would be hard to motivate and the physical interpretation in terms of actual processes that would lead to such a condition defy the imagination of the authors. For the sake of convenience, we neglect higher-order boundary conditions for the later discussion. The validity of the present approach will be established by comparing the present results with previously published results.Table 1 lists the kinematic boundary conditions in our finite element implementations. The capital letter C, S and F respectively represents the boundary conditions of the edges as clamped, simply supported and free. In addition, the dashes denote the unknown displacements on the corresponding boundary.In this section, static bending, free vibration and static buckling problems of a Timoshenko microbeam with various boundary conditions are numerical solved by applying the developed non-classical beam element. For simplicity, axial deformation is no considered in the following investigations. To verify the reliability and the accuracy of the aforementioned method, several comparison studies of the static and free vibration responses of the present method are carried out with the results given in the available literature [53,59,68]. Unless other stated, the microbeam investigated here is made of epoxy with the following m properties [6,27,53]: E=1.44GPa,ρ=1220kg/m3, ν=0.38 and l=17.6μm. The material length scale parameter l for the epoxy microbeam is based on the work reported by Lam et al. [6]. They fabricated the epoxy microbeams and conducted the bending tests by using a nano-indenter to determine the material length scale parameter which is depended on the material microstructures (e.g., dislocations, lattice defects and voids). Except where noted, the shear coefficient ksis taken to be5/6, which was often used for a rectangular cross-section beam. The following dimensionless quantities can be defined for the convenience:Dimensionless transverse deflection:w¯=1000wEJPL3forpointloadDimensionless transverse deflection:w¯=1000wEJfwL4oruniformloadDimensionless rotation:ϕ¯=1000ϕEJPL2forpointloadDimensionless rotation:ϕ¯=1000ϕEJfwL3oruniformloadDimensionless natural frequency:ω¯=ωL2m0EJDimensionless critical buckling load:F¯cr=FcrL2EJIn order to verify the convergence of the present approach, the static bending of a Timoshenko microbeam with the loading, geometry, and cross-sectional shape shown inFig. 2 is solved by applying the present non-classical beam element. The dimensionless deflection and rotation results listed inTable 2 are correspond to the C–C and S–S boundary conditions at the prescribed pointx=L/4. It is observed that the present method has good convergency and high precision. Therefore, one could observe that 20 elements are enough to get reasonably accurate results. So in all the following computation 20 elements are employed.For illustration purposes, the following parameters are used in computing the numerical results: P=100μN, E=1.44GPa, ν=0.38ρ=1220kg/m3, l=17.6μm, h=l, L=20h, and b=2h.As we all know, shear locking appears in the classical Timoshenko beam element when the thickness-to-length ratio is small. The reduced integration using a single Gauss point is utilized to compute shear strain energy while the full integration with two Gauss points is used for the bending strain energy. Unfortunately, the reduced integration often causes instability due to rank deficiency and results in zero-energy modes. Theoretically, it is well known that the shear effect reduces as the length-to-thickness ratio (L/h) increases. Hence, solutions of the Timoshenko theory will approach those of the Bernoulli-Euler model. Now, we illustrate the performance of the present Timoshenko beam element when the thickness becomes very thin. For the sake of simplicity, the material length scale parameters are all set to zero here. We consider a cantilever subjected a concentrate force P and a force couple M at the free end, as shown inFig. 3. Due to the lack of material length scale parameters, the element stiffness sub-matrices related bending deformation are given as(91)Kww=k5[65L110−65L110110215L−110−130L−65L−11065L−110110−130L−110215L],KϕwT=Kwϕ=k5[12110L12−110L−110L0110L−160L2−12−110L−12110L110L160L2−110L0],Kϕϕ=k5[15(137L+6k4Lk5)110(k4k5+1121L2)35(3L14−2k4Lk5)110(k4k5−13L242)110(k4k5+1121L2)L15(2k4k5+L27)110(−k4k5+13L242)−L10(L214+k43k5)35(3L14−2k4Lk5)110(−k4k5+13L242)15(137L+6k4Lk5)−110(k4k5+1121L2)110(k4k5−13L242)−L10(L214+k43k5)−110(k4k5+1121L2)L15(2k4k5+L27)].where k4=J(λ+2μ) and k5=Aμks.Now the present beam element is used to calculate the deflection and rotation at the right end. The element displacement and force vectors can be written as(92)δ=[wA(w,x)AwB(w,x)BϕA(ϕ,x)AϕB(ϕ,x)B]T(93)F=[RARAhRBRBhMAMAhMBMBh]Twhere wA, (w,x)A, ϕA, (ϕ,x)A, wB, (w,x)B, ϕB, (ϕ,x)Bare the node displacement parameters of the present beam element. RA, RB, MA, MBare the classical node forces;RAh,RBh,MAh,MBhare the higher-order forces work-conjugate to (w,x)A, (ϕ,x)A, (w,x)B, (ϕ,x)Brespectively. Note that the higher-order forces are all set to zeros.For concentrated force, the above equations are simplified as(94)δ=[0(w,x)AwB(w,x)B0(ϕ,x)AϕB(ϕ,x)B]T(95)F=[RA0P0MA000]TIn the case of force couple, it follows that(96)δ=[0(w,x)AwB(w,x)B0(ϕ,x)AϕB(ϕ,x)B]T(97)F=[RA000MA0M0]TBy solving finite element equation, the solutions of the cantilever subjected a point force are given as(98)wA=0,(∂w∂x)A=Pk5,wB=PL(3k4+L2k5)3k5k4,(w,x)B=P(L2k5+2k4)2k5k4,ϕA=0,(ϕ,x)A=PLk4,ϕB=12L2Pk4,(ϕ,x)B=0.With the same way, we can get the node displacement parameters for a cantilever subjected to a force couple as follows:(99)wA=0,(w,x)A=0,wB=12ML2k4(w,x)B=MLk4,ϕA=0,(ϕ,x)A=Mk4,ϕB=MLk4,(ϕ,x)B=Mk4,forforcecouple.Substituting the specific expressions of k4 and k5 into Eqs. (97) and (98), we obtain(100)wB=PL33EJ(1+ν)[12ks(hL)2+(1−2ν)(1−ν)],(w,x)B=PL2(1+ν)2EJ[(1−2ν)(1−ν)+112ks(hL)2],ϕB=PL2(1+ν)(1−2ν)2EJ(1−ν),forpointforce,And(101)wB=ML22EJ(1+ν)(1−2ν)(1−ν),(w,x)B=MLEJ(1+ν)(1−2ν)(1−ν),ϕB=MLEJ(1+ν)(1−2ν)(1−ν),forforcecouple.From Eqs. (100) and (101), one can clearly seen that the results obtained by the present Timoshenko beam element can reduce to the solutions of classical Bernoulli-Euler theory when the Poisson effect is set to zeros (i.e. ν=0) and the thickness-to-thickness ratio is very small. Consequently, it can be concluded that the present beam element performs well and the shear locking problem will not exist here.For comparison, the microbeam is taken to be made of epoxy. The cross-sectional shape is kept to be the same by lettingb/h=2. All material length scale parameters are considered to be equal to each other as l0=l1=l2=l=17.6μm. If the first two or all material length scale parameters equal to zero, the strain gradient model (SGT) will be turned into the modified couple stress model (MCST) or the classical model (CT), respectively.The dimensionless central deflections under uniform and point loads with different thickness-to-material length scale parameters ratio and length-to-thickness are given inTables 3 and 4, respectively. For comparison purposes, the analytical solutions given by Akgöz and Civalek are also listed in these tables. Excellent agreement is achieved between the present results and those analytical ones provided in Ref. [59]. To reflect the shear deformation effect, two cases of shear correction factor ks=107 andks=5/6are considered here respectively. It can be seen that shear deformation becomes more important for stubby beams. The deflection results obtained by the present beam element even are in good agreement with the analytical solutions of the Bernoulli-Euler microbeam, when the shear correction factor is set equal to a reasonable and large enough value.To further verify the vibration results, the dimensionless natural frequencies of a Timoshenko microbeam are compared with those of Akgöz and Civalek by adopting the same computation parameters. InTables 5 and 6, the dimensionless fundamental and second-order frequencies of the Timoshenko microbeam are respectively tabulated, where different dimensionless thickness (h/l) and dimensionless length (L/h) are considered. The comparison shows that the present frequencies are in very consistent with those of the existing literature.InFigs. 4 and 5, deflection and rotation curves of a simply supported Timoshenko microbeam subjected to the midspan load are plotted by using the present beam element by considering different beam theories, respectively.Figs. 6 and 7 depict the effects of dimensionless thickness (h/l) on variation of the fundamental natural frequency. According to the compare with the analytical solutions given by Wang et al. [53], it is clearly shown that the calculated results agree with the reference results pretty well. Note that the parameters of material property, geometry shape adopted here are same as the literature for direct comparison. The results of Wang et al. [53] are not depicted in Figs. 4–7 to make the present results more clearly.In this example, the dimensionless deflections of a Timoshenko microbeam under three different frameworks of continuum theory are plotted inFig. 8 as a function of the dimensionless length. The dimensionless deflections of Kahrobaiyan et al. [68] are used for comparison. Compared with the FEM results based on strain gradient Bernoulli-Euler element (see also Fig. 4 displayed in Ref. [68]), one can find that good agreement is obtained and the present FEM results are found to be reliable and precise enough. The graphical does not depict the deflection results of strain gradient Bernoulli-Euler element, see Ref. [68] for further details.To makes direct comparison, the microbeam is divided into 10 strain gradient Timoshenko beam elements, the material length scale parameters associated with the strain gradient theory, modified couple stress theory and classical theory are set as l0=l1=l2=l=11.01μm, l2=l=17.6μm and also l0=l1=0, and l0=l1=l2=0 respectively. The shear correction factor ksis set equal to 107 to eliminate the shear deformation effect.Fig. 9 plots the dimensionless end deflection w(L)/wCT(L) of the strain gradient cantilever versus dimensionless thicknessh/l. Making comparison with Fig. 5 illustrated in Ref. [68], it clearly shows that the deflection results by using the present approach are in good agreement with those of the existing literature.The micro-cantilever is assumed to be made of epoxy. In addition, geometry of the micro-cantilever is supposed to be: L=20h, b=2h and h=2l.In this section, the static bending results of Timoshenko microbeams with different boundary conditions are tabulated inTables 7 and 8 and depicted inFigs. 10–13. Dimensionless maximum deflections under uniform and point loads with different dimensionless thickness (h/l) and dimensionless length (L/h) are given in Tables 6 and 7, respectively, where different continuum beam theories are applied. Results are presented for C–C and S–C microbeams. It is clearly observed that the dimensionless deflections obtained on the basis of the strain gradient model are not only smaller than those of the classical model but also smaller than those of the modified couple stress model. This due to the fact that the stiffness matrix of strain gradient model contains three material length scale parameters related to dilatation gradient tensor and the deviatoric stretch gradient tensor in addition to the symmetric rotation gradient tensor, so that the increased bending rigidity of strain gradient Timoshenko microbeam is most. In other words, the more strain gradients introduced, the more enhancer of bending rigidity. The above results obtained by using the present method also indicate that the inclusion of small scale effects results in an increase in beam stiffness, and consequently, leads to a reduction of deflection. Such a small scale effect is significant when the beam thickness is close to the material length scale parameter (withh/l=1here), but becomes negligible with increasing beam thickness (withh/l=8here). It agrees with the general trends observed in experiments [4–8] and numerical solutions [24,27,53,68].Figs. 10 and 11 depict the deflection and rotation profiles for a Timoshenko microbeam with S–C boundary conditions and subjected to a point load for three different dimensionless thickness (h/l), respectively. Afterwards, the deflection and rotation profiles for a Timoshenko microbeam with C–C boundary conditions are displayed in Figs. 12 and 13 respectively. Since the consideration of point and uniform loads yields the similar results, for the sake of the brevity, the static responses are present for the point load only after this point. It is obviously seen that there have similar trends of size effect on the Timoshenko microbeam to those illustrated in Tables 7 and 8. Moreover, it is quite clearly seen that when the boundary constraint increases, the values of deflection and rotation decrease. Thus, constraints of the edges increase the bending rigidity of the microbeam, resulting in lower deflection and rotation.The static bending results tabulated in Tables 6 and 7 and plotted in Figs. 10–13, have not been reported in the open literatures so far, and therefore the solutions obtained may serve as benchmark values for further studies.The first two dimensionless natural frequencies for Timoshenko microbeams with different boundary conditions have been computed and the corresponding results are summarized inTables 9 and 10, respectively. The influences of the dimensionless thickness (h/l), dimensionless length (L/h) and boundary conditions on the free vibration parameters are examined in detail. It can be seen from the results of these tables that the dimensionless natural frequency decreases with increasing dimensionless thickness. Also, it is notable that the dimensionless natural frequency decreases as the dimensionless thickness (h/l) increases, and the frequencies predicted by the SGT beam model are not only larger than those of the CT model, but also than those of MCST model. By increasing the beam thickness, the results obtained by MCST and SGT models are nearly equal to the results obtained by CT model. In other words, it can be said that the results obtained by the CT and MCST are underestimated for small length.Plotted inFigs. 14 and 15 are the variation of dimensionless natural frequencies of Timoshenko microbeams with the value of dimensionless thickness (h/l) respectively for two different Poisson's ratio. It is observed that in the case of CT model, the value of dimensionless thickness has no effect on the vibrational behavior of the Timoshenko microbeam for all the boundary conditions. It is to be noted here that the dimensionless frequency increases with the Poisson's ratio increases. This increase in the dimensionless frequency is attributed to the increase of the stiffness of Timoshenko microbeam due to the Poisson effect. Another significant observation from these figures is that the Poisson effect is more pronounced for the classical model whereas it has little influences on the SGT model.Due to the lack of published solutions for these boundary conditions, these solutions obtained may serve as benchmark values for further studies.Finally, we consider the buckling problem for straight Timoshenko microbeams subjected to in-axial compressive load in which four different boundary conditions are taken into account, namely, S–S, S–C, C–F and C–C. The Timoshenko microbeam considered here is taken to be made of epoxy.Table 11 lists the buckling factor and length factor of axially loaded classical Bernoulli–Euler beams with the aforementioned boundary conditions.To verify the accuracy and applicability of the present beam element for analyzing the buckling problem, we should do some comparison studies. However, there are only limited results of the buckling problem in the published literature based on the strain gradient elasticity theory so far. According to what I have learnt, we only found that Akgöz and Civalek [56,58] investigated the stability for axially loaded microscale Bernoulli–Euler beams respectively made of homogeneous and functional gradient materials based on strain gradient elasticity and Ansari et al. [63] researched thermal postbuckling characteristics of FG Timoshenko microbeam based on strain gradient elasticity theory.To make comparison with [56],Table 12 lists the dimensionless critical buckling load of homogeneous Timoshenko microbeams corresponding to the different continuum models. The analytical solutions given by Akgöz and Civalek [56] for Bernoulli–Euler microbeams are also provided for direct comparison. Considering the fact that the buckling model investigated by Akgöz and Civalek [56] did not take into account the shear deformation effect, so the value of shear correction factor ksneeds to set large enough in our finite element implementations to alleviate this effect. Here, we take ksidentical to 107. Besides, the Poisson effect did not contain in the buckling model of Bernoulli–Euler microbeam, therefore the coefficient λ+2μ appeared in Eq. (55) should be replaced by the Young's modulus E in computing the numerical results for the comparison purposes. From Table 12, it is clearly seen that good agreement is achieved between the present results and those analytical ones [56]. Note that the critical buckling load is normalized asF¯cr=FcrL2/(EJ)here.Although there is still exists minor difference between the present results and analytical ones. Theoretically speaking, the present method can obtain analytical solutions when the shear correction factor is suppressed by letting ks=∞. However, the shear correction factor only can give a finite value by considering the numerical implementation.Table 13 lists the dimensionless critical buckling load obtained by using the present approach for other three different boundary conditions and various beam thickness. It should be emphasized that both the Poisson and shear deformation effects are not contained here. This can be viewed as the results for Bernoulli–Euler model.From Tables 12 and 13, it is notable that the influences of additional material parameters in strain gradient elasticity theory are significant, when the thickness of microbeams becomes small. When the strain gradient theory is applied, it is seen that the buckling value is significantly increases. One can see that the dimensionless critical buckling load obtained by the SGT model is about three times from the value obtained by the MCST model and 16 times from the CT model for very small length (h/l=1). It is also possible to say that, the results obtained by the classical and modified couple stress models are not suitable for microbeams in more general case, which not only the rotation gradient but also stretch gradient or other gradients, should be introduced. Namely, the size effect on buckling solution of Timoshenko microbeams via strain gradient elasticity theory is more efficient.It should be pointed that Ref. [56] can give buckling parameters for Bernoulli–Euler beam only, which neglects the Poisson and shear deformation effects. However, due to the lack of published solutions for the buckling of Timoshenko beams,Table 14 presents the numerical results for the Timoshenko microbeam with only taking into account Poisson's effect, andTable 15 presents the numerical results for Timoshenko microbeam taking into account both the two (i.e.,ks=5/6). The solutions obtained may serve as benchmark values for further studies.From Tables 13 and 14, the Poisson effect on the buckling parameters can be observed. Clearly, incorporating the Poisson effect (with ν=0.38 here) results in higher values of the buckling parameters than those without considering it (ν=0), which is especially true when the classical beam model is used. This trend agrees with what has shown by Ma et al. [27], Şimşek and Reddy [50] and Wang et al. [53] for free vibration analysis for a simply supported microbeam, where larger natural frequency values are obtained for the cases with ν=0.38 than those for the cases with ν=0. This indicates that the assumption of the Poisson effect being negligible, which is commonly used in the existing beam element, is inadequate and should be individually verified or simply abandoned in order to obtain more accurate and reliable results. Comparing the results listed in Table 14 with Table 15, it can be observed that the shear deformation effect results in slight lower values of the buckling parameters than those without considering it for the current microbeam withL/h=20andb/h=2.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A non-classical Timoshenko beam element has been developed based on the strain gradient elasticity theory for predicting the static, free vibration, and bucking behaviors of the microbeams. The present beam element is a two-node element which has 6-DOF (degrees of freedom) at each node by considering both bending and stretching deformations, and 4-DOF with only considering bending deformation. Unlike the classical Timoshenko beam element, the current strain gradient beam element satisfies the C0 continuity and C1 weak continuity and contains three material length scale parameters. The weak form equations of the Timoshenko microbeam for static, free vibration, and buckling are respectively given in the present work. One of the advantages of the present approach can effectively alleviate the shear locking problem even when the thickness of the beams is small and consequently the full integration can still be used. The other advantage of the present beam element lies in that it can deal with complexity boundary conditions. Static bending, free vibration and buckling of Timoshenko microbeams with various boundary conditions are investigated by utilizing the new element. The numerical results based on the current element are in agreement well with analytical results and numerical results in the existing literature.It is inferred that the new strain gradient beam element is a comprehensive beam element that is not only able to predict the results of SGT model, but also able to predict the results of MCST and CT models. This element enables the FEM to deal with the size-dependency observed in micro-/nano-scale structures where the attempts of the classical FEM will be in failure. Hence, in order to model the micro-/nano-scale structures numerically, employing the non-classical elements seems to be essential. It is also noted that the beams modeled by the new element show stiffer behavior than those modeled by the classical elements.
