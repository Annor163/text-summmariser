@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We study a class of mixed-integer programs for solving linear programs with joint probabilistic constraints from random right-hand side vectors with finite distributions. We present greedy and dual heuristic algorithms that construct and solve a sequence of linear programs. We provide optimality gaps for our heuristic solutions via the linear programming relaxation of the extended mixed-integer formulation of Luedtke et al. (2010) [13] as well as via lower bounds produced by their cutting plane method. While we demonstrate through an extensive computational study the effectiveness and scalability of our heuristics, we also prove that the theoretical worst-case solution quality for these algorithms is arbitrarily far from optimal. Our computational study compares our heuristics against both the extended mixed-integer programming formulation and the cutting plane method of Luedtke et al. (2010) [13]. Our heuristics efficiently and consistently produce solutions with small optimality gaps, while for larger instances the extended formulation becomes intractable and the optimality gaps from the cutting plane method increase to over 5%.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Consider a linear program with a joint probabilistic or chance constraint(1)minx∈Xcxs.t.P(Ax⩾b̃)⩾1-εwhereX⊆Rdis a polyhedron,c∈Rd,A∈Rm×d,b̃is a random vector taking values inRmand ε∈(0,1) is the reliability level.Chance constrained models have been utilized in several applications. In the context of finance (see [19]), the joint probabilistic constraint is commonly referred to as a Value-at-Risk constraint. In supply chain management [10], these models are used to consider random supply and demand. In distillation processes [7], chance constraints are used to analyze random water inflows. Optimal vaccination strategies for preventing epidemics [20] is yet another area where chance constrained models have been applied. For additional references, we refer the reader to [17].Problems with joint probabilistic constraints (1) can be grouped into one of the following two categories:1.The distribution ofb̃is discrete and finite.The distribution ofb̃is continuous or infinite.Case 1 problems can at least in theory be solved to optimality, by using binary variables to cast the problems as mixed-integer programs with “big-M constraints” [18,15]. However, in practice, this approach may have limited computational tractability in some settings.For case 2, aside from a few select distributions, no closed-form exists for evaluatingP(Ax⩾b̃)for a given candidate solution x, which prevents us from solving these problems to optimality. In lieu of exact solution methods, recent attention has focused on gradient methods [6] and on approximation methods that utilize Monte Carlo sampling [2,15,8]. The latter yields case 1 problems [12,16], which can then be solved either through mixed-integer programming [11] or through heuristic algorithms.In this paper, we build upon the work in Pagnoncelli et al. [16] to develop specialized heuristics for case 1 problems.Luedtke et al. [13] proved that the case 1 problems are NP-hard and to solve them they developed both a cutting plane algorithm and an extended mixed-integer programming formulation, which is a specialization of work by Miller and Wolsey [14], where all integer variables are binary. Luedtke et al. [13] leverage a natural ordering in the right-hand side to overcome the weakness of the big-M formulation. This inherent ordering has been utilized before in case 2 problems to develop a branch-and-bound algorithm [3] and we will also leverage this ordering in developing our linear programming based heuristic algorithms.Although we focus on case 1 problems, the algorithms we develop in this paper will have direct applicability to case 2 problems when used in conjunction with sampling approaches. We compare our algorithms with the cutting plane method and extended mixed-integer programming formulation of Luedtke et al. [13]. We show that while their extended formulation becomes intractable for larger problems and their cutting plane method produces increasing optimality gaps, our heuristics remain efficient and provide near-optimal solutions.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the mixed-integer programming problem that we aim to solve and presents the extended formulation of Luedtke et al. [13]. (We refer the reader to Luedtke et al. [13] and Atamtürk et al. [1] for detail on the cutting plane method.) In Section 3, we present our greedy and dual heuristic. In Section 4, we prove that the worst-case solution quality for our heuristic algorithms is arbitrarily far from optimal. In Section 5, we present a computational study that compares our algorithms with the extended formulation and the cutting plane method. Section 6 summarizes our contributions and discusses future research directions.
