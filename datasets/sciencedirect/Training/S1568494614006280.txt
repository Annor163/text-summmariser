@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Optimal performances of thin film devices such as those of micro/nano-electromechanical systems like sensors and actuators are possible with accurate and reliable characterization techniques. Such techniques can be enhanced if predictive models are constructed and deployed for production and monitoring. This paper presents functional networks as a novel modeling approach for rapid characterization of thin films such as thickness, deposition rate, resistivity and uniformity based on 8 deposition parameters. The functional network (FN) models were developed and tested using 154 experimental data sets obtained from ultrathin polycrystalline silicon germanium films deposited by Applied Materials Centura low pressure chemical vapour deposition system. The results showed that the proposed FN models perform excellently for all the outputs with minimum and maximum regression coefficients of 0.95 and 0.99, respectively. To further demonstrate the robustness of these models, several trend analyses were conducted. The performance statistics indicates that the mean percentage error for the model, based on the deposition rate, lies between 0.3% and 0.8% for silane, germane, diborane flow rates and pressure. For these deposition variables, the probability or p-value at a significance level of 0.01 implies that no significant difference exists between the means of the predicted and the measured values. The results are further discussed in light of physics of the CVD process.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Thin films, such as polycrystalline silicon germanium (poly-SiGe), are currently deployed for various technological applications ranging from micro/nano-electromechanical systems (M/NEMS) like sensors and actuators to magnetic storage media, thermal barrier coatings and many other microelectronic devices [1]. In these applications, high yields, high equipment utilization and high throughput are economically important, making real time in situ monitoring essential to their manufacturing processes [2]. As such, the manufacturing engineers need prior knowledge of some essential film properties such as thickness, deposition rate, resistivity and standard deviation of sheet resistance to monitor the performance status of the deposition tool and provide decision supports. In essence, the need for such a real time computation necessitates the development of predictive models that are not only accurate but also efficient.In previous studies, artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to predict thin film properties such as the intrinsic stresses [3], refractive indices, charge concentration and Hall mobility in silicon nitride films [4] and the ultimate shear strength of steel fibrous reinforced concrete (SFRC) corbels [5]. Also, multilayer feed-forward neural networks and radial basis function neural networks have been used to model input–output relationships for a plasma spray coating process [6] and fuzzy multiple objective programming was designed for inventory replenishment problem [7] among others. In spite of several applications of ANN, it has some draw-backs. Among them are slow learning rate, design space complexity and random initialization of weights and local minimal problem. ANN works like a black box where the predictive equations are unknown. Such a model cannot be used in isolation of the data upon which it is constructed. As a substitute, functional network (FN) was recently introduced as a powerful extension and network-based alternative to ANN [8–11]. In this case, neural functions are to be learned instead of weights while the outputs coming from different neurons can be forced to output the same values. Most importantly, the topology and neuron functions can be selected based on data, domain knowledge, or a combination of the two. Consequently, FN exhibits more versatility than ANN and is thus suitable for solving several problems.In thin film technology, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is one of the versatile methods for depositing ultrathin films and works by thermal decomposition of precursors in a reaction chamber [12]. It is widely used for technological applications and manufacturing of industrial devices and it is suitable for batch and semicontinuous operations [13]. CVD deposits films with good step coverage in addition to its ability to create films of varying stoichiometry. Because of these characteristics, CVD is preferred for depositing ultrathin films where layer conformity and good structural and electrical properties are essential. For nanofabrication where structural features are at nanometer scale level, it is important to deposit film of thickness within a reasonable accuracy. Also, it is necessary to have a film of low resistivity and minimum standard deviation of sheet resistance. While the former is a major determinant of the electrical properties, the latter is an indication of the film uniformity. Consequently, having a prior knowledge of these properties can be used in real time or run-to-run process control applications.This paper, therefore, presents functional networks as a novel modeling method to forecast thickness, deposition rate, resistivity and uniformity for ultrathin poly-SiGe films deposited by CVD process. The new approach helps to overcome the most common limitations of the existing predictive techniques such as multiple regressions and ANN. From the authors’ knowledge, this is the first reported study where FN is used to simultaneously characterize thin film properties. As a result, this work contributes to the cutting edge advances in computational intelligence for applications in thin film processes. It is our utmost desire that the resulting functional equations will serve as hand tools for thin film engineers and technologists working on CVD processes.Functional network (FN), a powerful data processing tool, was introduced as an extension and generalization to the standard neural networks [14,15]. FN deals with learning of general functions unlike connection weights in neural networks. Although general models exist, the topology and neuron functions of functional networks can be selected based on available data or domain knowledge. Functional network learns to modify the neuron functions, which are freely selected in a given domain. The neuron functions may be multivariate or multi-argument. Interestingly, it can be regarded as a white box model unlike the black box model of the neural network. It has the ability to learn from limited data and exhibits more versatility in solving a wide range of problems including prediction and classification [8–11].A typical functional networks consist of: (1) a layer of nodes for receiving input data (xi; i=1, 2, 3, 4), (2) a layer for the output data (x7) and none, one or more layers for intermediate information (x5 and x6); (3) a processing unit (fi) that evaluates a set of input values and delivers a set of output values (Fig. 1). The processing unit is the unknown neuron functions which are derived from a given family such as polynomial, exponential, Fourier, wavelet, etc. These functions are to be estimated during the learning process.Generally, a neuron function (fi) is represented as:(1)fi=∑j=1imaijϕijwhere coefficient aijis the parameter of the network to be estimated; ϕij={ϕi1, ϕi2, …, ϕim} ϕijis a family of linearly independent functions, such as polynomial, exponential and Fourier function among others. The learning method consists of obtaining the neural functions based on a set of data {D=(xi, yi); i=1, 2, …, n}, where x and y are sets of inputs and outputs, respectively. The learning process is based on minimization of Euclidean Norm of error function E given by:(2)E=12∑i=1im(yi−fi)2The associated optimization function may then lead to a system of linear or nonlinear algebraic equations which are solved simultaneously to obtain unknown coefficients.Polycrystalline silicon germanium (poly-SiGe) thin films were deposited on SiO2/Si substrate. The deposition was made in an Applied Materials Centura low pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) system (Fig. 2a) by thermal decomposition of pure silane (SiH4) and germane (GeH4, 10% in hydrogen). Based on the experimental design and parametric studies conducted earlier [16], 154 datasets on ultrathin poly-SiGe films were extracted (Appendix 1). The statistics of the datasets is summarized in Table 1. Each datum consists of eight deposition parameters (inputs) namely the deposition temperature -T-, silane flow rate -S-, germane flow rate -G-, diborane flow rate (B2H6) -D- and hydrogen (H2) flow rate -H-, chamber pressure -P-, shower head-heater spacing -HH- and deposition time -Tm- (Fig. 2b). For each film, 4 characteristics were measured: film thickness -h-, deposition rate -DR-, resistivity -ρ- and uniformity -SD- (or standard deviation of sheet resistance). The film thickness was measured using scanning electron microscopy (FEI NOVASEM 200) while the sheet resistance was characterized by 4-point probe (OmniMap RS75). The film uniformity was obtained as the standard deviation of the sheet resistance while the deposition rate was calculated from the ratio of the film thickness and the corresponding deposition time. The volume of the chamber and the substrate type are kept constant in the experiment.To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed functional networks models, two major statistical analyses – correlation coefficient and root-mean square error – were employed. The correlation between the predicted and experimental data sets is measured via correlation coefficient (R2) which lies between 0 and 1. For a perfect model R2=1 while R2=0 indicates a very poor (failed) model. The mathematical formula is given as:(3)R2=∑i=1n(Oexp(i)−O¯exp(i))(Omodel(i)−O¯model(i))∑i=1n(Oexp(i)−O¯exp(i))2∑(Omodel(i)−O¯model(i))2where Oexp,O¯exp, Omodel andO¯expare the experimental, experimental average, predicted and average predicted outputs, respectively, n is the size of the data sets. Similarly, the root mean-squared error (RMSE) quantifies the difference between the values implied by the model and the true values of the quantity being estimated. The closer it is to zero, the better is the model performance. RMSE is computed from the average of the sum of the residuals using the following equation.(4)RMSE=∑i=1n(Oexp(i)−Omodel(i))2nIn this study, we considered a generalized addictive model of the form of Eq. (5) since the problem domain does not suggest an initial model [10].(5)y=∑k=1s∑r=1qkCkrϕkr(xk)where y is the model response, Ckr, 1, …, kr are unknown parameters (coefficients) and the set of functions ϕs={ϕrs(xs)}, rs=1, 2, …, qs, s=1, 2, …, k are linearly independent. According to Fig. 3, the addictive model of Eq. (5) can be written as:(6)y=f1(x1)+f2(x2)+…+fk(xk)where fi(xi) denotes the sum of the function basis for each predictor variable, with its coefficients to be learned.Table 2.The functional network training is implemented in two steps. In the first step, suitable basis functions are selected and the coefficients of these functions are estimated using the least square optimization technique. Based on a set of observations: D={yi, xi1, xi2, …, xik; i=1, 2, …, n}, the approximation by the addictive model can be written as:(7)yˆ=∑j=1q1βj1ϕj1(xj1)+…+∑j=1qkβjkϕjk(xjk)+εi,i=1,…,n,where ϕsj, j=1, …, qs, s=0, 1, …, k, are the elements of the chosen family with order q, βjkare the coefficients of the network to be estimated and ɛiis the error. In matrix form, Eq. (7) can be written as:(8)yˆ=χβ+εBy using the standard least square error optimization technique, the coefficients can be obtained by minimizing:(9)(Y−χβ)T(Y−χβ)The second step is basically to reduce the complexity (size) of the network by the backward-forward search for further optimization using minimum description length (MDL) criterion. This criterion compromises between the network size and the error to choose the best coefficients contributing to the network (i.e. the one with the lowest value of MDL) [17].The 154 experimental data sets were randomly divided into 70% training set and 30% testing set. The training data sets were used to construct the predictive model while the predictive capability and accuracy of the models were evaluated by using the testing data sets. The trainings were conducted with addictive functional networks models with different families of linearly independent function namely, Fourier, polynomial, logarithm, and exponential as described in Section 3.2.2. Based on the training data sets, the coefficients of the functions depicted in Eq. (5) are automatically learned. By using least square optimization technique and backward-forward search based on minimum description length criterion, the best functional networks models were selected for each of the characteristic outputs. After the network is trained, it is validated using the test data set to ensure its generalization ability. For the deposition rate for instance, All basis functions mentioned previously with different orders were examined to determine the best combination of maximum R2 and minimum RMSE. Eventually, a polynomial basis function of order 1 gave the best line-of-fit with correlation coefficients R2>0.91 and R2>0.96 for the training and testing data sets, respectively (Fig. 4a and b). Accordingly, the deposition rates are accurately reproduced by the predictive model and are consistent with the measured data (Fig. 4b). This indicates that the model is learnt well with good ability to generalize. The procedure is repeated to obtain the best predictive models for thickness, resistivity and the standard deviation of the sheet resistance. For the 3 other outputs, the models have the best performances with the polynomial function of order 2 as summarized in Table 1. The RMSE values are equally satisfactory. Since FN gives us understanding of its internal working mechanism, the developed FN models can be depicted as mathematical equations. Unlike neural network, this gives further insight into the developed models, particularly on the effect of the model's parameters as discussed below.On the basis of the chosen networks, the developed functional networks models for the deposition rate (DR) in nm/s, thickness (h) in nm, resistivity (ρ) in (mΩcm) and standard deviation of the sheet resistance (SD) in % are provided in Eqs. (10.1)–(10.4), respectively.(10.1)1000DR=−1009+2.4T−6S+2.279G+2.543P−0.49D−0.16H−0.16HH+0.000218Tm(10.2)h=−6915.4+25.2T−8.9S+0.2S2+3.7G+10P−0.1P2−1.8D+0.5H+2.7HH+0.4Tm(10.3)ρ=1092−5.69T+0.007T2−2.168S+0.107S2−0.23G+0.001G2−0.064P+0.001P2+1.407D−0.038D2+0.19H−0.001H2+0.378HH−0.001HH2+0.0003Tm−0.001Tm2(10.4)SD=949.26−5.05T+0.0059T2−0.7081S+0.0521S2−0.0579G+0.1125P−0.0006P2+0.969D−0.0172D2+0.0932H−0.0001H2+0.4154HH−0.0004HH2−0.0002TmFrom the coefficients of the input parameters, the most influential parameters are the temperature, germane flow rate, silane flow rate and the chamber pressure. Also, the associated signs for these coefficients provide a first estimate of how the outputs trend with each deposition parameter. For example, the positive sign for T in Eq. (10.1) shows that the deposition rate is enhanced by an increase in deposition temperature while a negative sign for S indicates a negative correlation between silane flow rate and deposition rate. Similarly, the resistivity is lowered by an increased temperature as indicate by the negative sign of T in Eq. (10.3) (see Appendix 2 for details). By considering these trends as well as the R2 and RMSE of the testing data sets, the models results are considered accurate, reliable and subsequently can be deployed for forecasting.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this work, a novel predictive model based on functional network has been proposed and implemented to model the characteristics of ultrathin polycrystalline SiGe films that include thickness, deposition rate, resistivity and uniformity using eight deposition parameters as input to the system. The model has been constructed using real experimental data obtained from ultrathin polycrystalline silicon germanium films deposited by Applied Materials Centura low pressure chemical vapour deposition technique. The results demonstrated that functional network is a powerful tool for rapid thin film characterization. The predictions were accurate as a minimum regression coefficient of 0.95 was obtained for the testing data sets. Furthermore, the results of extensive trend analyses indicated that the models are robust and can be used to forecast film properties with minimum errors. Based on the excellent performance, it is suggested that this proposed system should be considered as viable tools for other yet-to-be considered thin film properties such as stresses, elastic properties, and acoustic properties, among others. For reliable performance, we recommend that the steps outlined in this work are followed to obtain customized models for other CVD systems. It is also part of our research plan and recommendations to investigate other artificial intelligence based techniques for comparison with the models presented herein.Detailed deposition parameters
