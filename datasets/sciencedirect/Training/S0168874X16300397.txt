We present a new approach to compute the mass matrix of solid finite elements which allows a significant reduction in the number of integration points. The method is based on exploiting information regarding the mathematical form of the integrand. This enables higher degree of precision for the same number of integration points compared to standard quadrature use. The approach is general and can be applied to both consistent and lumped matrices of all element types. Here, we focus on the consistent mass matrix of the widely used 10-node tetrahedral element, and demonstrate the superiority of the new approach over conventional quadrature use. For example, we show that the new integration scheme enables a degree of precision 4 with 1 integration point compared to 11 points with conventional numerical integration. Also, our 4-points integration rule is practically equivalent to conventional numerical integration with 15 points.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
FE analysis is an indispensable tool being used today in almost every field of engineering, design, and research. The need in simulating increasingly larger structures with many degrees of freedom leads to a constant race aiming at reducing the computation time. This is achieved by improvements in hardware capabilities, but also in raising the code efficiency.Any dynamic or transient simulation as well as modal-analyses of solid continua requires the calculation of the mass matrix. Conventionally, the mass matrix is computed using numeric integration with standard quadrature [1,2]. The mass matrix computational cost is proportional to the number of integration points. Thus, the motivation to formulate a numerical scheme that enables the same accuracy with a smaller number of integration points is clear. In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical approach for calculating the mass matrix. The method is based on the observation that the integrand of the mass matrix is composted from two multiplicative terms. The first is a simple polynomial expression that does not depend on the mesh, thus can be treated analytically. The second term is a mesh-dependent function which is handled by means of a simple polynomial approximation. In other words, we use information regarding the structure of the integrand in order to enhance the degree of precision of the numerical integration.Similar concepts have been considered previously, but in a different context. For example, it has been shown that symbolic computations combined with code generation allow significant reduction of computation time compared to traditional quadrature use (e.g. [3–6]). Also, closed form integration has been used in order to calculate more efficiently the stiffness matrix of specific elements, including plane elements [7–10], 3-D bricks [8,11,12], triangles [13,14], and 3-D elastic and electro-elastic tetrahedral elements [14–19]. Closed form formulation was also used to formulate an accurate and robust 10-node tetrahedral Cosserat-Point Element (CPE) that does not exhibit numerical stiffness for nearly incompressible material [20]. In another study, a systematic approximation combined with analytical integration of the weak form enabled high-accuracy closed-form expressions for the natural frequencies of skewed parallelepipeds [21]. Hinnant [22] proposed a technique of numerical quadrature especially suited for quadrilateral and hexahedron p-version finite element matrices. This technique is based on separating the integrand into two parts, and numerically operating on each part separately.In this paper, we propose a new integration approach specifically designed to compute the mass matrix of solid elements. By exploiting information regarding the mathematical structure of the integrand, we significantly improve the degree of precision of the numerical integration compared to standard quadrature use, for the same number of integration points. In other words, our approach provides a similar accuracy to standard quadrature using a smaller number of integration points, enabling lower computation cost. Our new approach is not limited to a specific element type, and can be applied to the calculation of consistent and lumped mass matrices [23]. Here, we thoroughly examine the consistent mass matrix of the widely used 10-node tetrahedral element. Accordingly, we organize the paper as follows: Section 2presents the general theoretical considerations. Two new approaches are discussed, namely the Optimization-Based (OB) and Semi-Analytical (SA) approaches. In Section 2.1, we propose a systematic procedure to obtain the unknown coefficients of the OB and SA approaches for the 10-node tetrahedral element. In Sections 3 and 4, we provide the necessary details and considerations in order to implement the OB and SA approaches, respectively, with 1, 4, 5, 8, and 10 integration points. In Section 5, we study the performance of the OB and SA approaches and compare their accuracy with that of conventional quadrature. Summary and main conclusions are discussed in Section 6.The consistent mass-matrix of a solid finite element is defined asMij=∫Vρ0NiNjdV,whereρ0is the initial mass density,Niare the element shape functions, and the integration is carried out over the initial volume of the elementV[24]. By introducing the local coordinates of the elementξ,η,ζ, the mass matrix takes the form(1)Mij=∫V□NiNj(ρ0J)dξdηdζ.Above,Jis the Jacobian determinant of the transformation from the global to the local coordinate system, andV□is the integration domain associated with the local coordinate system. The common approach to approximate (1) is to employ a numerical integration schemes, i.e.Mij=∑p=1npwpNipNjpρ0pJp. Here, the indexpindicates evaluation at an integration point,wpis the corresponding weight, andnpis the number of integration points. Thus, based on this “standard” (ST) approach,Mij≈MijSTwith(2)MijST=MijpSTρ0pJp;MijpST=wpNipNjp.In order to reduce the computational cost of the numerical integration, it is of interest to use the minimum number of integration points that still provides the sufficient accuracy. We propose to reduce the number of integration points by adopting a semi-analytical (SA) approach by rewriting (1) as follows. First, we note that the integrand can be separated into two multiplicative terms. The first,NiNj, is a simple polynomial expression that does not depend on the mesh (the locations of the element nodes), thus can be treated analytically. The second term,ρ0Jis a mesh-dependent function of the local element coordinates. Hence, we approximateρ0Jwith(3)ρ0J≈∑p=1npN^p(ξ,η,ζ)⋅(ρ0J)|(ξp,ηp,ζp)=∑p=1npN^pρ0pJp.Note that the ansatz functionsN^pand corresponding sampling points in (3) differ from the element shape functionsNiand integration points associated with the ST approach (1). Plugging (3) into (1) yields the SA approximation for the mass matrixMij≈MijSAwith(4)MijSA=MijpSAρ0pJp;MijpSA=∫V□NiNjN^pdξdηdζ.Note the similar mathematical form of the ST and SA approximations in (2)a and (4)a, which only differ in the way the coefficient matrixMijpis defined. Importantly, this matrix does not depend on the mesh, thus can be precomputed. In addition, the coefficients matrixMijphas to be computed only once. In other words, once these coefficients are set they are to be used for all elements (of the same type). In this sense, the use of the coefficientsMijpSAis similar to the implementation of weightswpin the standard approach. The main difference in terms of implementation is that in the standard approach each entry ofMijpSTrequires two multiplications of the pre-stored quantitieswpandNip, e.g.M123ST=w3N13N23; on the other hand, the entries ofMijpSAare pre-stored as is. Consequently, the SA approach requires slightly more memory but fewer multiplications. These differences in resources are minor, and, practically, the two approaches require a similar computational cost for the same number of points,np. However, we show in the following sections that the SA approach enables accuracy similar to that of the standard approach with significantly smaller number of integration points.Following the mathematical structure of (2)a and (4)a, we propose a third approach which we term “optimization-based” (OB) approach, whereMij≈MijOBwith(5)MijOB=MijpOBρ0pJp.The coefficient matrixMijpOBis pre-computed, as in the SA approach. However, here, it is calculated by means of an optimization process which aims to maximize the accuracy ofMijOB. In-depth discussion of this procedure is provided in Section 3.In summary, we present in this paper two new approaches, namely the SA and OB approaches. We develop a systematic method to obtain the coefficient matrices, and compare the accuracy of our new rule with that of the standard (ST) approach, which is the prevalent method in commercial finite-element software. Finally, we emphasize that the above considerations are general, and not specific to a particular element type. For specificity, we consider in what follows the well-known and widely used ten-node tetrahedral element.The OB and SA approaches require specification of the sampling points along with the coefficientsMijpOB(for the OB) and the ansatz functionsN^p(for the SA). Here, we view these as “unknowns” and look for the most suitable ones, namely those that make the SA and OB approximations most accurate for a prescribed number of points. Below, we propose a systematic procedure aiming at finding these unknowns. This procedure involves the following steps: (i) Generation of a set of random elements, representing the element population generated by automatic mesh generators, which we term “learning set”. (ii) Formulation of an objective function which reflects the average error with respect to the exact mass matrix of each element in the learning set. (iii) Determination of the unknowns by minimization of an objective function.For specificity, we consider below the ten-node tetrahedral element. Standard definitions of this element are recalled in Appendix A. In addition, without loss of generality, we consider the case of constant initial density,ρ0=1.The learning set includes random elements which are generated as follows. We begin with the parent element, shown inFig. 1. The nodes of the next element are randomly relocated by changing each degree of freedom by a random number uniformly distributed between[−δ,δ]. The value ofδis linearly increased from zero for the first element toδmaxfor the last element. Without loss of generality, the locations of nodes 1 and 5 are kept unchanged. This procedure repeats until the entire set is generated. In order to avoid unphysical elements we chooseδmax=0.12, and exclude from the learning set elements having a negative metric,J<0. Examples of such randomly generated elements are shown in Fig. 1b–d, and a flow chart summarizing the above procedure is presented inFig. 2. Once the learning set is generated, the exact mass matrixMij(n)of each element in the set is calculated using (1) (see also Appendix A). Heren=1,…,nlswherenlsdenotes the total number of elements in the learning set.In order to formulate the objective function, we introduce the relative error for each entry of the mass matrix for each element in the learning set, i.e.(6)Eij(n)≡Mij(n)−MijXX(n)Mij(n);XX=OB,SA.Note thatEij(n)is a function of the unknowns throughMijXX(n). We define the objective function as the sum of squared relative errors over all elements and entries. Recalling the symmetry of the mass matrix, we write(7)S=∑n=1nls∑i=110∑j=1i12(Eij(n))2.The factor1/2merely reflects common convention of objective function formulation. Finally, the unknowns are determined by the minimization ofS.In this section we apply the procedure described in Section 2 for determining the OB unknowns, namely the location of the sampling points and the coefficientsMijpOB. We repeat this procedure for five different cases that differ in the number of sampling points, i.e.np=1,4,5,8,10. We note that the OB approximation of the mass matrix (5) depends linearly on the coefficientsMijpOBwhile non-linearly on the sampling points throughJ(see Appendix A). The same applies to the relative errorsEij(n)(6). In other words, if the sampling points are prescribed, the minimization of the objective functionSbecomes a standard linear least-squares problem, which makes the minimization process simple and straightforward (e.g. [25,26]). Hence, we minimizeSby assuming locations of the sampling points and then determining the coefficients by means of a standard least means squares. This step is systematically repeated to establish the solution associated with the lowest residual (magnitude of the objective function evaluated using the solution for the unknowns).Symmetry considerations lead to the conclusion that a single sampling point,P1, should be located at the centroid of the tetrahedral element, i.e.(8)P1:(ξ=14,η=14,ζ=14).Once the location of the sampling point has been determined, the metric at the sampling point,J1, can be calculated for each element in the learning set (see Appendix A). Using (5)–(7), the objective function is formulated in terms of the coefficientsMijpOB. Following the least squares formalism, the minimization ofSwith respect to the coefficientMij1OByields a set of linear algebraic equations. The solution of this minimization problem gives “the best” coefficients, and is obtained using the symbolic mathematical software MapleTM. These coefficients, i.e. the components of a10×10symmetric matrixMij1OB, are detailed in the supplementary file Result_Matrices.xls, and yield a residual ofS=775.6.The tetrahedron is a 3-D structure with four faces and four head nodes. Thus, it is not possible to arrange two or three sampling points inside the domain while maintaining symmetry. Turning to four sampling points, symmetry considerations suggest that the sampling points should be located on the lines connecting the centroid to the head nodes1,2,3,4, each at a (normalized) distanceafrom the centroid.11We note that another arrangement may be considered, where the points are located on the lines connecting the centroid to the geometric center of each face. However, this arrangement yields a higher residual (inferior accuracy) and is therefore not presented.Hereamay take values between zero and one, wherea=0represents the centroid anda=1coincides with a head node (seeFig. 3), i.e.(9)P1:(ξ=14−14a,η=14−14a,ζ=14−14a)P2:(ξ=14+34a,η=14−14a,ζ=14−14a)P3:(ξ=14−14a,η=14+34a,ζ=14−14a)P4:(ξ=14−14a,η=14−14a,ζ=14+34a).Prescribingadefines the locations of the four sampling points, and similarly to the procedure described in Section 3.1, we minimizeSwith respect to the coefficientsMijpOB(p=1,2,3,4)by means of a linear least-squares method. This procedure is repeated for various values ofa, and the corresponding residuals are recorded (seeTable 1). Table 1 indicates that the optimal location of the sampling points corresponds to the range0.3<a<0.4. A careful analysis in this range reveals that the location of the sampling points which leads to the lowest residual is arounda=0.36with a residual ofS=13.3. The corresponding coefficientsMijpOB(p=1,…,4)are detailed in the supplementary file Result_Matrices.xls.The same symmetry considerations used in Section 3.2 suggest that four of the five sampling points should be located on the lines connecting the centroid to the head nodes (9), while the fifth point at the centroid (8). Based on a similar analysis we find that the location,a, associated with the lowest residual isa=0.5, with a residual ofS=4.4. The corresponding coefficientsMijpOB(p=1,…,5)are detailed in the supplementary file Result_Matrices.xls.Following the symmetry considerations described in Section 3.2, the eight sampling points are located as follows. Four points are located on the lines connecting the centroid to the head nodes (9), and four points are located on the lines connecting the centroid to the geometric center of each face, i.e.(10)P5:(ξ=14−14b,η=14+112b,ζ=14+112b)P6:(ξ=14+112b,η=14−14b,ζ=14+112b)P7:(ξ=14+112b,η=14+112b,ζ=14−14b)P8:(ξ=14+112b,η=14+112b,ζ=14+112b).Above,bmeasures the normalized distance between the centroid and the geometric center of the face, i.e.bmay take values between zero and one, whereb=0represents the centroid andb=1coincides with a face center.The locations of the sampling points are dictated by two parametersaandb. Performing a similar analysis to that described in Section 3.2, we find that values ofa=0.6andb=0.7lead to the lowest residual,S=0.65. The corresponding coefficientsMijpOB(p=1,..,8)are detailed in the supplementary file Result_Matrices.xls.The ten sampling points are located on the lines connecting the centroid to each node. The four points associated with the head nodes are described in (9), and the locations of the other six points is dictated by the normalized distanceb, i.e.(11)P5:(ξ=14+14b,η=14−14b,ζ=14−14b)P6:(ξ=14+14b,η=14+14b,ζ=14−14b)P7:(ξ=14−14b,η=14+14b,ζ=14−14b)P8:(ξ=14−14b,η=14−14b,ζ=14+14b)P9:(ξ=14+14b,η=14−14b,ζ=14+14b)P10:(ξ=14−14b,η=14+14b,ζ=14+14b).Carrying out a similar procedure as in Section 3.4 we find that the lowest residual is obtained witha=0.6,b=0.5, leading toS=0.034. The corresponding coefficientsMijpOB(p=1,.…,10)are detailed in the supplementary file Result_Matrices.xls.The SA approximation requires the determination of the coefficientsMijpSA, which are calculated using ansatz function,N^p, and sampling points (4). Here, we propose a systematic procedure to determine the ansatz functions, and show that the corresponding residual is similar to that of the OB approach. Since the OB approach enables one to obtain the lowest possible residual for the learning set, this is an indication that our choice ofN^pis sound. A main advantage of the SA approach over the OB approach is by providing the exact mass matrix for a wide range of practical cases. This is further discussed below.Recall thatJis a 3rd order polynomial. Thus, we use a polynomial approximation in (3) which is exact at the sampling points. To this end, we choseN^pto be polynomials satisfying the condition(12)N^p|Pk=δpk;p,k=1,…,np.The polynomial order of the ansatz functionsN^pincreases with the number of sampling points, resulting in higher accuracy of the approximation forρ0J. In particular, one sampling point is associated with a zero order polynomial, four sampling points enable a complete set of first order polynomials, and ten points a complete set of second order polynomials. Accordingly, one sampling point enables computing the exact mass matrix for all constant-metric (flat-faced) elements. In addition, with four points, we are able to exactly compute the mass matrix of all elements with a linear metric, and with ten points we are able to compute the exact mass matrix of all elements with a quadratic metric.In order to determine the SA coefficients, we need to specify the location of the sampling pointP1and the ansatz functionN^1. The location of the sampling point is determined by the same considerations as in Section 3.1 to be at the centroid of the element (8). Also,(13)N^1=1.in accordance with condition (12). Calculating the SA coefficients using (4) leads to(14)Mij1SA=(6111−4−6−5−4−6−61611−4−4−6−6−4−61161−6−4−4−6−6−41116−6−6−6−4−4−4−4−4−6−632161616168−6−4−4−616321681616−4−6−4−616163216816−4−6−6−416816321616−6−4−6−416168163216−6−6−4−481616161632)⋅12520.The corresponding residual isS=867.8.Following the same considerations as in Section 3.2, the location of the four sampling points is determined by (9). The ansatz functions that form a complete set of first order polynomials are(15)N^p=cp0+cp1ξ+cp2η+cp3ζ,p=1,…,4wherecpmare constants (independent of the local element coordinates) that are found from condition (12). Thus, we conclude with(16)N^1=1a(14(a+3)−ξ−η−ζ);N^2=1a(14(a−1)+ξ)N^3=1a(14(a−1)+η);N^4=1a(14(a−1)+ζ).For a prescribeda, the SA coefficients are calculated directly using (4), and the corresponding residual is obtained from (7). The procedure is repeated for several values ofa, and the corresponding residuals are recorded (seeTable 2). The lowest residuals in Table 2 are those associated witha=0.3and 0.4. The two residuals are practically equal, and any value of0.3<a<0.4is a reasonable choice. We usea=0.36resulting in a residual ofS=15.04. The corresponding SA coefficients are provided in the supplementary file Result_Matrices.xls. A comparison between Tables 1 and 2 indicates that the residuals of the SA approach almost reproduce those of the OB approach, both in terms of magnitude and in terms of dependency witha. The fact that the residuals of the SA approach are slightly higher than the residuals of the OB approach is not surprising, since the OB coefficients are the optimal coefficients for the learning set.As in Section 3.3, we locate four of the five sampling points on the lines connecting the centroid to the head nodes (9), and the fifth point at the centroid (8). Five ansatz functions are not sufficient to form a complete second-order polynomial. Thus, we writeN^p=cp0+cp1ξ+cp2η+cp3ζ+cp4f(ξ,η,ζ);p=1,…,5, wherefis a higher order polynomial of the local coordinates. SinceJis a 3rd-order polynomial, several symmetric expressions (and their linear combinations) may be considered, e.g.ξ2+η2+ζ2,ξη+ξζ+ηζ,ξηζ, etc. We find that the residual obtained with the functionf=ξ2+η2+ζ2is significantly lower compared to the other alternatives. Hence, we write(17)N^p=cp0+cp1ξ+cp2η+cp3ζ+cp4(ξ2+η2+ζ2),p=1,…,5.The constantscpmare determined by imposing condition (12). The resulting ansatz functions are detailed in Appendix B. Once the ansatz functions are specified, we repeat the procedure described in the previous subsection to determine the locations of the sampling points. We conclude witha=0.5producing a residual ofS=4.9. The corresponding SA coefficients,MijpSA, are calculated using (4) and appear in the supplementary file Result_Matrices.xls.ForNp=8, the locations of the sampling points are described in (9) and (10). Since eight Ansatz functions are not sufficient to form a complete second-order polynomial, we adopt an approach similar to the one described in the previous subsection, i.e.N^p=cp0+cp1ξ+cp2η+cp3ζ+∑m=47cpmfm(ξ,η,ζ)wherefmare higher order polynomials, andcpm(p,m=1,…,8)are constants independent of the local coordinates. As in the case ofnp=5, several symmetric combinations of the functionsfmmay be considered. We find that the combination yielding the lowest residual is(18)N^p=cp0+cp1ξ+cp2η+cp3ζ+cp4ξ2+cp5η2+cp6ζ2+cp7(ξη+ξζ+ηζ),p=1,…,8.As in the previous subsection, the constantscpmare determined from condition (12), see Appendix B for details, and the location of the sampling points, defined similarly to Section 3.4, is found asa=0.6andb=0.7with a residual ofS=0.82. The corresponding SA coefficients,MijpSA, are calculated using (4) and appear in the supplementary file Result_Matrices.xls.As in Section 3.5, the ten sampling points are located on the lines connecting the centroid to each node. The locations of the four points associated with the head nodes are defined bya(9), and the locations of the other six points are determined byb(11). With ten ansatz functions it is possible to form a complete second-order polynomial that satisfies condition (12) (see Appendix B). Following the same procedure described in the previous subsections, we determine the locations of the sampling points asa=0.6andb=0.5, which yield a residual ofS=0.036. The corresponding SA coefficients,MijpSA, are calculated using (4) and appear in the supplementary file Result_Matrices.xls. A summary of the residuals obtained with the OB and SA approaches for 1, 4, 5, 8, and 10 sampling points is presented inFig. 4.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We presented in this paper two new approaches, namely the SA and OB approaches, to calculate the mass matrix. The SA approach is based on the observation that the integrand of the mass matrix is composted from two multiplicative terms. The first,NiNj, is a simple polynomial expression with respect to the local coordinates that does not depend on the mesh (see also Appendix A), thus can be treated analytically. The second term,ρ0Jis a mesh-dependent function of the local element coordinates. Hence, we suggest a simple polynomial approximation forρ0J(3), which allows analytical integration to precompute the SA coefficientsMijpSA(4). This way we effectively increase the degree of precision. For example, in the case of a ten-node tetrahedral element, the termNiNjis a fourth order polynomial (see Appendix A); thus by approximatingρ0Jwith a single sampling point (N^1=1,ρ0J≈N^1ρ01J1) we obtain an integration scheme with degree of precision 4. Note that in the general case a degree of precision 4 requires a minimum number of 11 integration points [2]. The SA scheme has been formulated to integrate expressions having the specific mathematical structure of Eq. (1), hence is a “case-specific” integration formula, specialized for calculating mass matrices. In other words, we use information regarding the structure of the integrand in order to enhance the degree of precision of the formula.The OB approximation (5) possesses a mathematical structure similar to that of the SA approach. However, the OB coefficients are calculated merely by an optimization process aiming at maximizing the accuracy of the formula. We developed a systematic procedure for this process, which includes: (i) Generation of a set of random elements (learning set). (ii) Calculation of the exact mass matrix for each element in the learning set. (iii) Formulation of an objective function in terms of the unknowns, based on which the optimization was performed. (iv) Determination of the unknowns. Note that the SA approach uses a similar procedure to determine the location of the sampling points. Since the OB approach enables one to obtain the lowest residual for the learning set, it is viewed as a lower bound for assessing the residual of the SA approach. Fig. 4 indicates that the residuals of the SA approach are close to those of the OB approach. The competency of the SA approach is further emphasized in Tables 3–7, as discussed below.By definition, the OB and SA coefficients,Mijp, do not depend on the mesh, thus can be precomputed. The precomputation, which involves an optimization procedure, may appear challenging; however it needs to be performed only once. In other words, once these coefficients are set they are to be used for all elements (of the same type). In this sense, the role of the coefficientsMijpSAis analogous to that of weights in the standard approach. Moreover, we have shown that the ST approach can be rewritten with a mathematical structure similar to that of the SA and OB approaches, and that the three schemes require a similar computational cost for the same number of points,np.The numerical results in Section 5 indicate that the accuracy of the SA approach is, by far, superior to that of the ST approach. The SA approach is also preferable over the OB approach since it enables exact integration for many practical elements. As a reference, we recall that ABAQUS uses 15 integration points with the ST approach in order to compute the mass matrix of ten-node tetrahedral elements. Our results show that the SA approach with four sampling points yields a comparable accuracy, and that the SA approach with 8 sampling points outperforms the ST approach with 15 points for all the examined geometries. In the same line of thought, the SA approach with a single sampling point outperforms the ST approach with 4 integrations points. In addition, the SA approach can be easily adjusted to use conventional locations of integration points. This slightly decreases the accuracy of the integration (see Appendix C), yet it enables one to use the values ofJpwhich have been computed for the purpose of other integrations, e.g. stiffness matrix and internal forces.In summary, we have shown that:•The SA and ST approaches require a similar computational cost for the same number of points.The SA coefficients are mesh independent, and are precomputed. In that sense they resemble the weights used in the ST approach.The degree of precision of the SA approach is higher than that of the ST approach for the same number of points. For example, a degree of precision 4 is achieved with 1 point for the SA approach compared to 11 points for the ST approach.A direct consequence of the previous point is that the SA approach enables significantly higher accuracy compared to the ST approach for the same number of points. Specifically:1.The accuracy of SA with 4 points is practically equivalent to ST with 15 points.The accuracy of SA with 1 point is practically equivalent to ST with 4 points.The above features have been tested for the entire range of practical elements, from flat-faced elements to elements with high aspect ratios and highly curved faces.Following the above, we undoubtedly conclude that the SA approach is superior to the ST approach. Implementing the SA scheme may require some modifications to “standard” computational procedures currently used in commercial software. However, these changes pose no significant challenge and are clearly worthwhile since the SA approach enables accuracy comparable to that of the ST approach with a significantly lower computational cost.The purpose of this appendix is to recall standard definitions of the solid 10 node tetrahedral element. We begin with the element shape functions:(19)N1=(1−ξ−η−ζ)(1−2ξ−2η−2ζ),N2=ξ(2ξ−1),N3=η(2η−1),N4=ζ(2ζ−1),N5=4ξ(1−ξ−η−ζ),N6=4ξη,N7=4η(1−ξ−η−ζ)N8=4ζ(1−ξ−η−ζ),N9=4ξζ,N10=4ηζ.The location of a material pointXis given byX=∑i=110NiXiwhereNiare the shape function (19), andXiare nodal positionsXi=∑m=13Xmiem.

This slightly decreases the accuracy of the integration, yet it enables one to use the values ofJpwhich have been computed for the purpose of other integrations, e.g. stiffness matrix and internal forces. Below, we compare between the accuracy of the SA approach with conventional locations of sampling points (a=5/5) to that of the SA approach with optimal locations of sampling points (a=0.36, see Section 4.2). Stiffness matrix of 10-node tetrahedral elements is computed with four integration points in commercial packages, e.g. ABAQUS. Thus, for practical reasons, we present inTable 8 the results associated with four integration points. Results of the ST approach with four integration points are also indicated for convenience.
