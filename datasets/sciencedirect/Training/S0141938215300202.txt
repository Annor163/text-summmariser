@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A series of Eu3+-activated Li2Mg2(WO4)3 (LMW) materials were synthesized by high temperature solid state reactions. The phosphor can be effectively excited by 394nm near ultraviolet light and emit intense red light with high color purity. Prepared phosphors can be indexed to LMW with particular lyonsite structure. The occupation of Eu3+ in LMW is selective. Most of Eu3+ comes into 1A sites without inversion symmetry. The present research suggests that LMW is a suitable host for luminescence applications and Eu3+-activated LMW is a promising phosphor for phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recently, phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-white-LEDs) have been widely used in the field of lighting and display. The eventual performance of these pc-white-LEDs strongly depends on the luminescence properties of the phosphors employed. Thus, relevant devices would be remarkably advanced by the discovery of optimized phosphor materials. The most commonly used red phosphor for near ultraviolet (UV) LEDs is Y2O2S: Eu3+[1–3]. However, it has poor absorption in near UV region. Simultaneously, it is chemically unstable for its nature of sulfide and uneconomical for the usage of rare earth oxide in the host. Therefore, a red phosphor with high absorption in the near UV region, satisfying chemical stability and low cost, is urgently needed for commercial applications. In order to obtain desirable color purity, Eu3+ is indispensable for red phosphors. Therefore, the current pivotal task is to find a stable, cheap and easily synthesized host. Simultaneously, such a Eu3+ doped phosphor should be fit for near UV LEDs which have been extensively commercialized now.Lyonsite is a mineral which can be the archetypal structure for large numbers of materials, such as perovskite, garnet, apatite, and spinel. Oxide classes such as these can accommodate a wide variety of metal cation while retaining their unique structure. Adaptable framework structures can have different properties because of the varying elemental compositions [4]. Currently, investigations about lyonsite structure mainly focus on two properties: ionic conduction and catalysis. Li2Mg2(WO4)3 (LMW) is a peculiar lyonsite-type tungstate found in 1994 [5]. It is orthorhombic in Pnma (62) space group with lattice parameters: a=5.1129Å, b=10,462Å, and c=17.612Å at room temperature (RT). Few studies involve the luminescent properties of rare earth ions in LMW till now. Thus we prepared a series of pure and Eu3+ doped LMW and investigated their luminescence properties and structure. The results indicate that Eu3+ activated LMW is a promising red phosphor for pc-white-LEDs and LMW is a desirable host for luminescent materials. The results found in this work can blaze a new way in finding a proper phosphor.All the phosphors were synthesized by high temperature solid state reaction (HTSSR). Raw materials Li2CO3, MgO, WO3, and Eu2O3, were weighed according to the composition of Li2−xMg2−x(WO4)3, Eu3+x(x=0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10). The weighed materials were put into an agate mortar and ground with an agate muller for 2h. Then they were heated up to 700°C in a tubular furnace. The samples were preserved at 700°C for 30h with twice intermediate regrinding. To be clear, these samples are abbreviated as LMW, LMW-2, LMW-4, LMW-6, LMW-8, and LMW-10, respectively.Phase identification of prepared phosphors was carried out by a Beijing MSAL-XD-2 powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The excitation, emission spectra and decay curves of all the samples were measured with a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The morphology of the samples was studied with a Hitachi S3400N scanning electron microscope (SEM). The absorption spectra of the samples were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2450 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. All the measurements were performed at room temperature. As for the details of these instruments, the reader can refer to our previous literatures [6,7].

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Multi-wavelength excited red phosphors Eu3+ doped LMW were successfully prepared by HTSSR. Obtained phosphors can be effectively excited with 394nm near UV light and present strong red emission. The XRD measurements and structural analysis show that prepared phosphors can be indexed to LMW with a unique lyonsite structure. Doped Eu3+ in LMW mainly occupies those interspaces among adjacent hexagonal tunnels without inversion symmetry. Energy absorbed from near UV light by the host can be effectively transferred to doped Eu3+. This makes the phosphor emit red light with good color purity. All these research results suggest LMW is a novel host for luminescent materials and Eu3+-activated LMW is a promising phosphor for pc-white-LEDs. This research will turn our attention to a new class of compounds, i.e. lyonsite structures which can fit to serve as the host for phosphors. In the near future, more and more compounds with lyonsite structures will be investigated as the host of luminescent materials.The work presented in this paper was carried out in 2015. While the original manuscript of this paper was under review after its submission in October 2015, another independent paper also reporting the synthesis and characterization of the phosphor material described in this paper was published elsewhere [19]. In our independent research work, the results indicate that Eu3+ doped Li2Mg2(WO4)3 is a promising red phosphor which can be effectively excited with multiple excitation wavelength. The main conclusions in our work are consistent with the published work. It is worth pointing out that the occupation of Eu3+ in Li2Mg2(WO4)3 was discussed in detail in our work.
