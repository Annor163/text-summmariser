@&#ABSTRACT@&#
CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+ (RE=Er, Ho, Tm) phosphors were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. XRD patterns confirmed tetragonal structure under different RE3+ and M+ ions doping conditions. Particles shapes and sizes were confirmed by SEM and TEM analyses. Particles shape and size were well tuned by control of solution pH; spherical balls consisting of nano-grains at low pH of ∼2, rice grain shapes at moderate pH of ∼6, and thin flakes at higher pH of ∼12, were observed. Fine tunability of upconversion (UC) emission color was achieved by doping multiple RE3+ ions within a single CaMoO4 host. Blue, green and orange upconverted emission were observed by doping Tm3+, Er3+ and Ho3+ in the CaMoO4, respectively. Further, the emission colors were well tuned by the combination of Tm, Er and Ho ions and their concentrations. CaMoO4:Tm3+,Ho3+,Yb3+ exhibited perfect white emission with well tunability from cool white to warm white colors. Substitution of part of Ca ions by M+ (M=Li, Na, K, Rb) ions affected the crystal field symmetry around RE3+ ions and hence changed the transition probabilities between their f–f transition levels, consequently intensified the UC intensities. The blue (Tm3+), green (Er3+), and orange (Ho3+) upconversion intensities of CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+,0.10K+ phosphors increased by 60, 50 and 40 folds compared to the unsubstituted analogues, respectively. The K substituted CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+,K+ phosphors exhibited intense UC emissions visible by naked eye even pumped by less than 1mW laser power and can have potential application in displays and variety of other applications.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Photon upconversion involves the absorption of several photons of low energy with subsequent emission of higher energy photons. Various processes can lead to upconversion, including two/three-photon absorptions, ground state followed by excited state absorption, energy transfer upconversion, second harmonic generation, and photon avalanche [1–3]. Since its discovery in the 1960s, upconversion (UC) has been the focus of research [3–11]. These upconversion materials has several potential applications in solar cells [4], novel display technologies [5], inks for secure printing [6,7], optical communication and amplifier [8], high density optical storage [9], infrared detection and sensors [10], and more recently bio medical diagnosis and therapies [11,12]. Urged by the potential applications, these UC materials with strong luminescence in the NIR to visible or NUV region has been extensively investigated in recent years.One of the promising applications of the upconverting nanomaterials is its use in the solar cell industries to improve the efficiency of the present solar cells. Due to the mismatch between the wavelengths of the solar radiation and those traditional silicon solar cells, the efficiency of silicon solar cell is limited. Photons below the band gap of the silicon semiconductor are not absorbed. Significant increase in efficiency can therefore be expected by utilizing upconverting nanomaterials that would shift the unused part of the solar radiations (longer than 1100nm) to the optimal spectral range of the silicon solar cell (400–1000nm). Lahoz et al. achieved 0.3% external quantum efficiency increment by applying the upconverting fluoride glasses on the rare face of the c-Si cell [13]. Trupke et al. demonstrated the external efficiencies of nearly 1% by applying NaYF4 UC phosphor in the similar fashion [14]. Lin et al. applied Y6W2O15 UC phosphor in the GaAs solar cell and increased the efficiency remarkably [15]. Wu et al. applied YF3 UC phosphor for the efficiency increase of Dye sensitized solar cell and demonstrated efficiency increment [16]. All above literatures suggests that use of UC phosphor is a promising way to increase the efficiency of various type of solar cells. However, all of the above mention applications are dependent on the UC luminescence efficiency and homogenous particles of the UC phosphor for device fabrication. Thus, development of highly efficient, environmentally resistant and homogenous nanoparticles UC phosphor with low excitation density threshold is utmost, especially, for solar cell applications. Oxide materials are usually chemically, mechanically and thermally stable and could therefore be promising host for the light upconversion application if their UC efficiency is increased remarkably.Another promising application of the UC phosphor is the novel environmentally friendly display applications. Much of the lighting which is employed at present market utilizes the excitation of a mixture of several phosphors in an atmosphere containing mercury. The trend to other environmentally friendly types of lighting necessitates a search for alternative mechanisms and new phosphors. Upconverting materials indeed can be used to fabricate such novel display items. With the advent of cheap laser diodes, the upconversion of infrared radiation by suitable Ln3+ combinations is of current interest. Recently, multicolor UC by different host and or different Ln3+ ions has been exploited in sol–gel derived thin films, and solid state samples [17,18]. However, for novel display applications, high brightness with continuous emission are desired. In addition, they should be resistant to photo-bleaching and harsh environment like higher temperature and corrosion. However, the present upconverting nanomaterials suffer mainly two demerits, (1) they exhibit extremely low efficiency and need high power lasers to visualize by human eye that is not permitted from the safety point of view [19,20] and (2) lack of full color (blue–green–red) efficient upconversion within single host to realize better devices. To overcome from the first demerit, i.e. to increase the efficiency, several attempts have been made such as co doping with sensitizer ions [2,21,22], crystal surface coating [23,24], core/shell synthesis [25,26], metal plasma resonance [27], co-doping with different metal ions [28–30], and different preparation methods [2]. However, none of these methods have achieved the desired level of UC efficiency (should be pumped by as low as 1mW laser power). Hence, the luminescence intensity enhancement of UCNPs is still a challenging topic.Mainly, the UC intensity is governed by following three factors: (1) high electronic transition probabilities of the dopants [30–32], (2) the energy transfer rate from sensitizer (Yb3+) to emission center (Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+, etc.) which intern depends on the extent of overlap of the transition dipoles of these two ions. Thus, the distances between Yb3+ and Tm3+ (Er3+, Ho3+, etc.) ions affect the energy transfer and migration and the UC intensity [20,21], and (3) the local environment of RE3+ ions in the host lattice. The crystal field, which is responsible for breaking the selection rule for the forbidden 4f–4f transitions of RE3+ ions, originates from the atoms surrounding the RE3+ ions [33]. According to the Judd–Ofelt theory, the luminescence emission peak position and its efficiency can be well controlled by tuning the crystal filed asymmetry around the central metal ion [31,32]. For instance, Teng et al. synthesized NaxScF3+x:Yb,Er nanocrystals and studied the effect of polarity of the reaction medium on the phase and composition of the nanocrystals and used Sc3+ doped crystals for multicolor tuning [33]. Huang et al. reported that small amount of Sc3+ ions doping results the higher UC intensity [34]. The Sc3+ ions occupies the Y3+ position in NaYF4 lattice. Since the Sc3+ ion is smaller than Y3+ ion, small amount of Sc3+ doping will destroy the local symmetry around the emission center resulting in the higher UC intensity. Luitel et al. controlled the emission colors in the Sr4Al14O25:Eu2+ by host cation substitution and observed a white luminescence by controlled crystal field of RE ions [35]. Dou et al. tuned the UC spectra by doping different alkali metal ions into the NaYF4:Yb,Er phosphor [29]. They reported no UC emission intensity enhancement, but the blue/green, blue/red, and green/red emission intensity ratios were affected by the concentration of Li+ and K+. Singh et al. explored the PL emission enhancement of the phosphor by Li+ doping [30]. Compared to the huge number of studies on the NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals, very small effort has been paid on the work of oxide based UC phosphors [20,22,36,37].Herein, we report color tunable highly efficient UC in a CaMoO4 single host by co-doping multiple rare metal ions (Tm3+, Er3+, Ho3+) and varying their concentrations. Significant improvement of upconversion intensity was achieved by tuning the crystal asymmetry by substituting part of the host metal ion by various alkali metal ions.Calcium molybdate phosphors doped with RE3+ and Yb3+ ions; CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+; were prepared by hydrothermal (HT) process. In a typical hydrothermal reaction, 10mM mixture of Ca/Yb/RE (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O/Yb(NO3)3·5H2O/RE(NO3)3·5H2O) were prepared in a beaker with distilled water by constant stirring with magnetic stirrer. In the case of alkali metal ions substituted sample, CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+,M+ (M=Li, Na, K, Rb), part of Ca2+ ions were substituted by double amount (in moles) of specific M+ ions. In a separate beaker, 10mM (NH4)2MoO4·2H2O was prepared in distilled water. Citric acid was used as template/surfactant and urea as precipitating agent such that controlled precipitation could be achieved. The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted by aqueous ammonia/nitric acid solution. 30ml of the mixture was poured into a 50ml Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 200°C for 12h. The white solid obtained was centrifuged, washed multiple times with distilled water followed by ethanol and freeze dried for 12h. Samples were further calcined at 700°C for 1h to get the final crystalline CaMoO4:RE3+,Yb3+ phosphors.Phase identification was carried out using a Shimadzu XRD-6300 instrument with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the phosphor particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi-S3000N). Elemental analysis was carried out using EDX coupled with SEM. Before SEM measurements, each sample was coated roughly 5nm in thickness with platinum-palladium using Hitachi E-1030 ion sputter. Mass percentage of the constituent ions were estimated using Rayny EDX-800HS energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. UC emission spectra, pumped by a 980nm cw laser with variable power output (<1–200)mW were recorded using USB 4000 UV–VIS–NIR miniature fiber optic spectrometer (Ocean optics). CIE color chromaticity values were obtained using BW TEK spectrometer using BaSO4 as white standard. All measurements were carried out at room temperature unless specified.
