@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Pedestrian detection is an important image understanding problem with many potential applications. There has been little success in creating an algorithm which exhibits a high detection rate while keeping the false alarm in a relatively low rate. This paper presents a method designed to resolve this problem. The proposed method uses the Kinect or any similar type of sensors which facilitate the extraction of a distinct foreground. Then potential regions, which are candidates for the presence of human(s), are detected by employing the widely used Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) technique, which performs well in terms of good detection rates but suffers from significantly high false alarm rates. Our method applies a sequence of operations to eliminate the false alarms produced by the HOG detector based on investigating the fine details of local shape information. Local shape information can be identified by efficient utilization of the edge points which, in this work, are used to formulate the so called Shape Context (SC) model. The proposed detection framework is divided in four sequential stages, with each stage aiming at refining the detection results of the previous stage. In addition, our approach employs a pre-evaluation stage to pre-screen and restrict further detection results. Extensive experimental results on the dataset created by the authors, involves 673 images collected from 11 different scenes, demonstrate that the proposed method eliminates a large percentage of the false alarms produced by the HOG pedestrian detector.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Pedestrian detection is one of the most popular areas in computer vision over the recent years [1–3]. A pedestrian is defined as a human standing in an almost upright position. There are two main classes of methods for pedestrian detection, namely, the generative methods and the discriminative methods. Both methods aim at distinguishing between human and non-human classes of objects [4]. The main concept behind generative methods is to find one or several models (e.g., shape models [5], texture models [6], and others) for classification, while the main concept of discriminative methods is to find the best descriptive features (e.g., Haar wavelet features [7], Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) [8], Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) [9]) or find the optimal parameter values for their classifier (e.g., Neural Networks (NN) [5,10], Support Vector Machines (SVM) [11] and Adaboost [12]) [7]. The majority of techniques which were originally developed for pedestrian detection perform well only in scenarios where the entire human silhouette is present in the image. Recently, researchers have started to consider using techniques which investigate the characteristics of the image at a local fashion [11,13]. The main advantage of this type of approaches is that the object of interest may be recognized even in the case of occlusion by other objects or when part of it is not visible [14,15].Inspired by these methods, we propose a pedestrian detection scheme which investigates both global and local shape information and take advantage of recent methodologies developed by experts in this field, to achieve a more accurate detection result. Specifically, to detect pedestrians in an image, firstly, possible candidate regions are estimated by the HOG detector. These regions are kept for subsequent investigation while the remaining regions where no humans were detected using HOG are discarded from the investigation. Taking into consideration the high false alarm rate of HOG detector, candidate regions are further investigated using alternative models. In other words, the proposed framework aims at eliminating false alarms produced by the HOG pedestrian detector while preserving the true detections. There are several challenges in pedestrian detection, e.g., posture variations, heavily cluttered background, occlusion and others. To decrease the influence of these problems, in the proposed work, multiple models rather than one single model are involved to improve evaluation effectiveness. Furthermore, the Kinect depth sensor is also employed to facilitate the elimination of irrelevant signals which affect the detection results, such as background signals, weak edges and texture. We explore the proposed method on a dataset created by the authors that involved 673 patches collected from 11 different scenes with 470 human existing patches and 203 human-like patches.We discuss the method in Section 2, describe the experiments and performance evaluation results in Section 3 and give conclusions in Section 4.
