@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, the unsteady pulsatile magneto-hydrodynamic blood flows through porous arteries concerning the influence of externally imposed periodic body acceleration and a periodic pressure gradient are numerically simulated. Blood is taken into account as the third-grade non-Newtonian fluid. Besides the numerical solution, for small Womersley parameter (such as blood flow through arterioles and capillaries), the analytical perturbation method is used to solve the nonlinear governing equations. Consequently, analytical expressions for the velocity profile, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate are obtained. Excellent agreement between the analytical and numerical predictions is evident. Also, the effects of body acceleration, magnetic field, third-grade non-Newtonian parameter, pressure gradient, and porosity on the flow behaviors are examined. Some important conclusions are that, when the Womersley parameter is low, viscous forces tend to dominate the flow, velocity profiles are parabolic in shape, and the center-line velocity oscillates in phase with the driving pressure gradient. In addition, by increasing the pressure gradient, the mean value of the velocity profile increases and the amplitude of the velocity remains constant. Also, when non-Newtonian effect increases, the amplitude of the velocity profile.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Blood is known as one of the most important heterogeneous multi-phase mixtures in nature that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. Generally, blood is composed of plasma (contains water, glucose, dissipated proteins, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide), blood cells (red blood cells ‘RBCs’ and white blood cells ‘WBCs’), platelets, etc. In spite of the fact that plasma behaves as a Newtonian fluid, it is commonly accepted that the hematocrit (the volume percentage of RBCs in blood, which is normally 45% for men and 40% for women) exhibits shear-thinning behavior and therefore, must be modeled as a non-Newtonian fluid [1].Some numerical studies in blood flow simulation, such as Ogulu and Bestman [2], Ogulu and Amos [3], and Ellahi et al. [4] have considered blood as a Newtonian fluid. For example, Ellahi et al. [4] performed a theoretical study for Newtonian blood flow of nanofluid through composite stenosed arteries with permeable walls. They simplified the highly nonlinear momentum equations of nanofluid model by considering the mild stenosis case. The hypothesis of Newtonian blood is valid for large blood vessels (arteries and veins), but when the diameter of the blood vessel is the same order of magnitude as the red blood cells and corpuscles (such as arterioles and capillaries), it is widely accepted that the non-Newtonian nature of blood has to be taken into account. Using non-Newtonian model for blood can be seen in the works of Majhi and Nair [5], Haldar and Andersson [6], Prakash and Ogulu [7], Moyers-Gonzalez et al. [8], Massoudi and Phuoc [9], Cherry and Eatona [10], Alimohamadi and Imani [11], Moawed et al. [12], Ellahi et al. [13–15], Akbar et al. [16], Caballero and Lain [17], and to name but a few. For example, Ellahi et al. [13] presented mathematical models for blood flow of Jeffrey fluid (a non-Newtonian fluid having shear thinning property) via nanoparticles in the tapered stenosed atherosclerotic arteries. In their studies, the effect of catheter and the influence of heat and mass transfer of nanoparticles on blood flow behaviors were revealed. Ellahi et al. [14] investigated the unsteady and incompressible arterial blood flow of non-Newtonian fluid (micropolar fluid) through composite stenosis. They developed analytical solutions of velocity and volumetric flow flux in terms of modified Bessel functions. Ellahi et al. [15] examined the heat and mass transfer on blood flow of non-Newtonian fluid (micropolar fluid) through a tapered stenosed artery of permeable walls. They evaluated the exact solutions for velocity, temperature and concentration profiles. And Akbar et al. [16] performed a theoretical study on the unsteady blood flow of a Williamson fluid (which represents the behavior of pseudo-plastic materials, particularly of polymer solutions and powder suspensions in Newtonian fluids) through composite stenosed arteries with permeable walls. They simplified the highly non-linear momentum equations of the Williamson fluid model by considering the mild stenosis case.Also, the physical properties of the non-Newtonian blood have been presented in many published papers such as Fowkes et al. [18], Baieth [19], Ghasemi et al. [20] and so forth. One of the approved non-Newtonian models, in simulating the blood flow is the third-grade non-Newtonian model. There are a lot of numerical studies on blood flow simulation in which, the researchers utilized the third-grade non-Newtonian fluid in the blood modeling such as Majhi and Usha [21], Majhi and Nair [5], Hayat et al. [22,23], Zeeshan and Ellahi [24], Hatami et al. [25], Ghasemi et al. [20], and to name but a few. For example, Hayat et al. [22] carried out an analysis for MHD flow and heat transfer characteristics in a third grade fluid between two porous plates (with the application of blood flow in the coronary arteries). Zeeshan and Ellahi [24] studied the fully developed flow of an incompressible, thermodynamically compatible third-grade non-Newtonian MHD fluid in a pipe with porous space and partial slip (by considering the application of blood flow in the arteries). And Ghasemi et al. [20] simulated the steady-flow of a third-grade non-Newtonian blood in porous arteries in presence of magnetic field using analytical and numerical methods.Blood flow in the human cardiovascular system is caused by the pumping action of the heart. The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals, which produces a pulsatile pressure gradient throughout the system (popularly known as a pressure pulse which physicians check at the wrist). Pressure and flow rate are characteristic in pulsatile shapes that vary in different parts of the arterial system [26,27]. Thus, several researchers have studied the pulsatile flow of blood in blood vessels. Clark [28] presented the experimental results of the pulsatile flow in a laboratory model of aortic stenosis taking the Reynolds number appropriate to aortic flow. Chaturani and Palanisamy [29] proposed a mathematical model to study the pulsatile flow of blood (by treating blood as a Power-law fluid) through rigid circular tubes under the influence of periodic body acceleration. Majhi and Nair [5] studied the pulsatile flow of blood subjected to externally imposed periodic body acceleration by assuming blood as a third grade fluid. They investigated numerically the effects of the body acceleration on the velocity, the flow rate and the wall shear stress for femoral and coronary arteries. Sarkar and Jayaraman [30] studied the flow pattern of pulsatile Newtonian blood flow in a catheterized stenosed artery through a mathematical model. Their study took into account the effect of the movement of the flexible catheter influenced by the pulsatile nature of the flow. Elshehawey et al. [31] examined pulsatile flow of blood (Newtonian model) through a porous medium under the influence of body acceleration. Craciunescu and Clegg [32] investigated the influence of the blood pulsation rate on the temperature distribution and energy transport for four typical blood vessel sizes: aorta, large arteries, terminal arterial branches, and arterioles. In their numerical works, blood was considered as a Newtonian fluid. Long et al. [33] performed numerical simulations of 3-D pulsatile Newtonian blood flow in straight tube stenosis to investigate the post-stenotic flow phenomena by means of commercial CFD package CFX4 (AEA Technology). El-Shahed [34] studied pulsatile flow of Newtonian blood through a stenosed porous medium under the influence of body acceleration. He obtained analytical expressions for axial velocity, fluid acceleration, flow rate and shear stress. Khanafer et al. [35] conducted a numerical study to determine the influence of pulsatile laminar flow and heating protocol on temperature distribution in a blood vessel and tumor tissue receiving hyperthermia treatment. They modeled the arterial wall as macroscopically homogeneous porous media and the blood as an incompressible Newtonian fluid. Ogulu and Amos [3] modeled pulsatile Newtonian blood flow within a homogeneous porous cardiovascular system in the presence of a magnetic field and time-dependent suction. Their studies showed an increase in the wall shear stress when the porosity of the medium was increased. Nagarani and Sarojamma [36] developed a mathematical model of pulsatile blood flow (using the non-Newtonian Casson fluid) through small blood vessels. They used perturbation method to solve the governing equations by assuming that the Womersley frequency parameter is small. Massoudi and Phuoc [9] examined the unsteady pulsatile flow of blood in an artery, where the effects of body acceleration were included. They modeled the blood as a modified second-grade fluid where the viscosity and the normal stress coefficients depend on the shear rate. Siddiqui et al. [37] mathematically investigated the effects of non-Newtonian nature of blood and pulsatility on flow through narrow arteries by considering two types of non-Newtonian fluid models, i.e. Herschel–Bulkley fluid model and Casson fluid model. They reported that the mean and steady flow rates decrease as the yield stress increases. Shit and Roy [38] interrogated the effect of externally imposed magnetic field and body acceleration on pulsatile flow of blood (micro-polar fluid model) through an artery with no-slip velocity condition. Sharma et al. [39] studied numerically pulsatile magneto-hydrodynamic arterial blood flow in the presence of double stenosis. They used the Newtonian incompressible fluid for blood modeling. Recently, Sharma et al. [40] attempted the study of pulsatile blood flow through axisymmetric stenosed artery subject to an axial translation with hematocrit concentration-dependent blood viscosity. In their study blood was considered as a viscous incompressible Newtonian fluid, flowing in a rigid walled circular artery.The motivation of this paper is to study the unsteady pulsatile magneto-hydrodynamic flow of third-grade non-Newtonian blood through porous arteries influenced by externally imposed periodic body acceleration. The pulsatile flow is examined by taking into account a periodic pressure gradient. The third-grade non-Newtonian fluid is one of the constitutive model that can describe shear-thinning (or shear-thickening) and normal stress differences, which are characteristic of non-Newtonian/viscoelastic fluids. Beside the numerical approach, for small Womersley parameter (i.e. blood flow through small blood vessel size such as arterioles and capillaries), the analytical perturbation method is utilized to solve the nonlinear governing equations. Consequently, analytical expressions for the velocity profile, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate are obtained. The results of perturbation method are compared to those obtained by the numerical method. In addition, the effects of the governing parameters such as body acceleration, magnetic field, the third-grade non-Newtonian parameter, the pressure gradient, and porosity, on the velocity profile, the blood flow rate and the wall shear stress are examined. Application of such study includes magnetic drug delivery in blood, transport of complex bio-waste fluids and magnetic field control of gastro-intestinal disorders, magnetic endoscopy, control of blood flow rate during surgeries, etc.The unsteady pulsatile laminar flow of incompressible non-Newtonian blood fluid through a porous artery in the presence of a magnetic field is considered. A schematic figure of the problem, including the mechanical physics in the cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, x) is shown in Fig. 1. In this problem, blood flows in the x-direction through a fully porous vessel (or artery) of radius R with an axial velocity of u(r, t). It means that, the flow is assumed to be stable and axisymmetric with no radial and swirl components of velocity. It is supposed that, there is no-slip condition (u=0) on the outer wall (r=R). Blood flow is caused by the pressure gradient (∂p/∂x) produced by the pumping action of the heart. It can further be assumed that(1)−∂p∂x=A0+A1cos(ωpt),where, A0 is the constant steady-state part of the pressure gradient, A1 is the amplitude of the pressure fluctuation giving rise to the systolic and diastolic pressures, ωp=2πfpis the heart pressure frequency, and fpis the pulse rate frequency. In many cases for example sudden movement of the body during exercises and traveling in fast speed airplanes or vehicles, the body (and blood flow) may experience external acceleration as well as the gravitational field. These cases certainly affect the normal blood flow which lead to physiological problems such as headache, decreased vision, abnormality in pulse rate, and so on. Therefore, due to the physiological importance of body acceleration, the body acceleration is assumed to be given by a harmonic formula as follows:(2)g(t)=Agcos(ωgt+φ),where, Agis the amplitude of the acceleration, ωg=2πfgis the frequency, and φ is the lead angle of the body acceleration with respect to the pressure gradient. It should be noted that, the effect of gravity in radial direction is neglected. For the described problem and all given assumptions, the governing equation including the conservation of momentum in x direction is expressed as follows [5,9,20,25]:(3)ρ∂u∂t={divτ}x−μKu−ρAgcos(ωgt+φ)−σB02u,where, τ is the non-Newtonian stress tensor, subscript x refers to the axial direction, K is the permeability of porous medium, μ is the viscosity of the blood, ρ is the density of the blood,σB02is the magnetic field strength, and t is the time. Stress tensor for the third-grade fluid is given by [23,25,41](4)τ=−pI+[μ+β(trA12)]A1+α1A2+α2A12,where, α1, α2, and β are the material moduli, p is the pressure, and the kinematical tensors A1 and A2 (Rivlin–Ericksen tensors) for the present problem are defined as follows [42]:(5)A1=00∂u∂r000∂u∂r00;A2=2∂u∂r200000000.Now, the following dimensionless parameters are introduced:(6)r¯=rR,u¯=uU∞,t¯=ωp2πt,where, U∞ denotes the reference velocity. Substituting Eqs. (1), (4) and (5) into Eq. (3), using the dimensionless quantities given in Eq. (6), the non-dimensional form of the governing equation after dropping bars for simplicity, leads to the following relation:(7)α2∂u∂t=B1(1+γcos2πt)+1r∂u∂r+∂2u∂r2+Λ1r∂u∂r3+3∂2u∂r2∂u∂r2−(M2+P)u+B2cos(2πωt+φ),where, α2=(ρωpR2)/(2πμ) is the Womersley number, B1=(A0R2)/(μU∞) is the pressure gradient parameter, γ=A1/A0,Λ=(2βU∞2)/(μR2)is the third-grade non-Newtonian parameter,M2=(σB02R2)/μis the magnetic parameter, B2=(ρAgR2)/(μU∞) is the acceleration parameter, ω=ωg/ωpis the frequency ratio, and P=R2/K is the porosity parameter. It should be noted that B2/B1=ρAg/A0. In this problem, the initial and boundary conditions in dimensionless form are as follows:(8)at(t=0),u=0.at(r=0),∂u∂r=0,at(r=1),u=0.It should be noted that, the Womersley number (α2) is a dimensionless parameter in bio-fluid mechanics. It is a dimensionless expression of the pulsatile flow frequency in relation to viscous effects. Since the vessel diameters in the body differ up to three orders of magnitude, the Womersley number will depend predominantly on diameter [43]. The Womersley number of human blood flow can be estimated as according to Table 1[44]:In this section, the non-linear partial differential equation (7) with the initial and boundary conditions (8) are solved using a finite difference techniques (the forward difference approximation in term of time and the central difference approach in the space direction for both 1st-order derivative and 2nd-order derivative around grid point (j, n)) as follows:(9)α2ujn+1−ujnk=B1(1+λcos2πtn)+1rjuj+1n−uj−1n2h+uj+1n−2ujn+uj−1nh2+Λ1rjuj+1n−uj−1n2h3+3uj+1n−2ujn+uj−1nh2uj+1n−uj−1n2h2−(M2+P)ujn+B2cos(2πωtn+φ),where, k=Δt is the time-step, h=Δr is the step for radial direction, tn=(n−1)k is the spending time, andujnis the blood axial velocity at radius rjand time tn.Analytical techniques for simulation of non-Newtonian fluids flow have been recently reported in many published researches. For example, Tripathi and Beg [45] studied the hydromagnetic peristaltic flow of non-Newtonian couple stress fluids through the gap between two concentric channels containing a Darcian porous medium, with the inner channel being rigid by using a semi-analytical method. Khan and Smarda [46] used the homotopy perturbation method with general form of linear operator to solve dimensionless nonlinear ordinary differential equations of the Hiemenz flow of a non-Newtonian fluid. Hatami and Ganji [47] presented the analytical solution of heat transfer for a non-Newtonian nanofluid flow (sodium alginate fluid with titanium dioxide) in the porous medium between two coaxial cylinders. Later, they also investigated analytically the natural convection of a non-Newtonian nanofluid flow (sodium alginate fluid with copper and sodium nanoparticles) between two vertical flat plates [48]. Eldabe et al. [49] studied the peristaltic motion of non-Newtonian fluid with heat and mass transfer through a porous medium in the channel under the effect of magnetic field via a perturbation series’ method. Abdulhameed et al. [50] employed an analytical perturbation transform method for solving the transient flow of third grade fluid in a porous channel generated by an oscillating upper wall. Ghasemi et al. [20] utilized three semi-analytical methods namely collocation method, optimal Homotopy asymptotic method, and fourth order Runge–Kutta method, to solve the differential equations of blood flow containing nanoparticles through porous arteries in presence of magnetic field. In this clause, the analytical perturbation method is used to solve a special case of the nonlinear governing equation (7), i.e. small Womersley parameter and neglecting the porosity and magnetic field parameters (M2=P=0). For this purpose, one can rewrite Eq. (7) as follows:(10)α2∂u∂t=f(t)+1r∂∂r(rτ),where, τ=(∂u/∂r)+Λ(∂u/∂r)3 is the shear stress and f(t)=B1(1+γcos2πt)+B2cos(2πωt+φ). Considering the Womersley parameter to be small (α2=ɛ≪1), for example, blood flow through small blood vessel size such as arterioles and capillaries, the axial velocity component and the shear stress are expressed in the following form(11)u=u0+εu1+⋯.(12)τ=τ0+ετ1+⋯.By inserting Eqs. (11) and (12) into Eq. (10), one gets:(13)ε∂u0∂t+ε∂u1∂t+⋯=f(t)+1r∂∂r(rτ0+εrτ1+⋯).The boundary conditions are as follows:(14)at(r=0),∂u0∂r=∂u1∂r=τ0=τ1=0.at(r=1),u0=u1=0,τ0andτ1are finite.Simplifying Eq. (13) results:(15)1r∂(rτ0)∂r+f(t)=0.(16)∂u0∂t=1r∂(rτ1)∂r.Integrating Eq. (15) and using the boundary condition (14), resultτ0=−r2f(t). In the other hand,τ0=∂u0∂r+Λ∂u0∂r3. Therefore:(17)∂u0∂r=127Λ31+27Λr2f21612−rf4Λ13−13Λ127Λ31+27Λr2f21612−rf4Λ−13.It can be assumed that the parameterΛr2f2=2βR2μ3r2{A0(1+γcos2πt)+ρAgcos(2πωt+φ)}2is very small (less than 1) for small blood vessel size (R≪1) such as arterioles and capillaries. Hence,(1+(27Λr2f2/16))1/2is approximated as 1+(27Λr2f2/32). Consequently:(18)∂u0∂r=13Λ1+27Λr2f232−27Λrf413−13Λ1+27Λr2f232−27Λrf413.In addition, for small blood vessel size, it is accepted thatΛr2f2≪Λrf. Therefore, Eq. (18) can be approximated as follows:(19)∂u0∂r≈13Λ1+27Λr2f23×32−27Λrf3×4−13Λ1+27Λr2f23×32−27Λrf3×4=13Λ1+27Λr2f23×32−27Λrf3×4−13Λ1−27Λr2f23×32+27Λrf3×4≈−rf2+33Λr2f216.Integrating Eq. (19) and using the boundary condition (14) resultu0=1−r24f+3Λr3−116f2. Now, Eq. (16) is reduced tor1−r24f′+23Λr3−116ff′=∂(rτ1)∂r, which resultsτ1=r8−r316f′+23Λr4/5−r/216ff′. In the other hand,τ1=∂u1∂r+3Λ∂u0∂r2∂u1∂r. Therefore:(20)∂u1∂r=r8−r316f′+23Λr4/5−r/216ff′1+3Λ∂u0∂r2=f′8−3Λff′16r−f′16r3+3Λff′80r41+3Λ−rf2+33Λr2f2162∼18−3Λf16r−116r3+3Λf40r41+3Λ4r2f2f′.Integrating Eq. (20) results:(21)u1=−183Λf+112Λf2+118Λ2f4f′ln1+3Λ4f2r2−f′24Λf2r2+4tan−13Λ4fr45Λ2f4−2r15Λ3Λf3+r3303Λff′+c,where, the integral constant c is obtained by using the boundary condition of u1=0 at r=1. Finally, the velocity profile will be as follows:(22)u≈1−r24f+3Λr3−116f2+α2u1.At the end of this section, it would be valuable to give the analytical expressions for dimensionless shear stress, wall shear stress, and blood flow rate. By considering the relations of τ0 and τ1, the formulation of dimensionless shear stress (τ) and wall shear stress (τw) can be expressed via Eqs. (23) and (24) respectively, as follows:(23)τ≈−rf2+33Λr2f216+Λ−rf2+33Λr2f2163+α2r8−r316f′+3Λr4/5−r/28ff′.(24)τw=−τ|r=1≈−−f2+33Λf216−Λ−f2+33Λf2163−α2f′16−33Λff′80.For calculating the blood flow rate, the relation of u1 is simplified by considering the Taylor series ofln1+3Λ4f2r2≈3Λ4f2r2−123Λ4f2r22andtan−13Λ4fr≈3Λ4fr−133Λ4fr3. Therefore, the flow rate is obtained as follows:(25)q=∫01urdr≈f16−33Λf2160+α2−196+3Λf128+Λf2128−Λ3Λf3256f′.In order to check the validity of the present study, the results obtained by the numerical and perturbation methods are compared together for the governing parameters selected based on Refs. [29,51]. The governing parameters are presented in Table 2. The non-dimensional velocity (u) in arterioles and capillaries is plotted in Fig. 2for various values of 2βR2/μ3 in one complete time cycle starting from time t1. Here, t1 is the time when the maximum velocity is attained on the center-line of the blood vessel during one time cycle. Fig. 2a and b are for arterioles and Fig. 2c and d are for capillaries. The results show an excellent agreement between the numerical and perturbation solution methods, especially for small values of Λr2f2 or (2βR2/μ3) belonging to the blood vessels of small diameter. In addition, the dimensionless wall shear stress (τw) and the blood flow rate (q) in arterioles are illustrated in Fig. 3for 2βR2/μ3=0.0001 (as an example) in one complete time cycle starting from time t1. The results depict a good agreement between the numerical and analytical (perturbation) solution. Therefore, it is concluded that the results obtained by the numerical calculation which are presented in the later sections are accurate.Here, the second way to ensure the validity of the present numerical calculation is introduced. By considering Λ→0, the blood behaves as a Newtonian fluid (see Eq. (7)). For this condition and by setting the other blood vessel's parameters as, fg=fp=1.2Hz, φ=0°, Ag=−9.8m/s2, and γ=0.2; the calculated amplitude ofτwand q for different values of R (and consequently α2) are compared to those obtained by Chaturani and Palanisamy [51] in Table 3. Good agreement between the present study and the results of Chaturani and Palanisamy [51] is evident. Therefore, it is deduced that the results of the numerical calculation which are illustrated in Section 6 are accurate. It should be noted that the reported wall shear stress and the blood flow rate in Ref. [51] are in dimensional form while they are presented in Table 3 in dimensionless form.
