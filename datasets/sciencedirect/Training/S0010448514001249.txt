@&#ABSTRACT@&#
There has been considerable work on scaffold design based on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS). Current methods used to adjust the parameters in one type of TPMS model are insufficiently flexible for designing architectures comprising multiple porous structures. In this paper, we propose two CAD methods that combine different TPMS-based structures with given transition boundaries. One method is a sigmoid function (SF) method that can be effectively applied to simple transition boundary cases. The second method is a Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF) method that can be applied to more general cases. These methods provide for placing given TPMS-based substructures on given 3D subspaces with perfect transitions to their adjacent substructures within a scaffold domain. We present various examples of functionally graded porous structures with desired internal porous structures and external geometries to demonstrate the effectiveness of these two methods. The resulting models can be exported as STL-files and be fabricated using an additive manufacturing process.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
For scaffolds that are used for tissue engineering, their pore architectures and properties, such as pore shape, pore size, porosity, mechanical stiffness, surface properties, and rate of degradation, can govern cell attachment  [1], provide for efficient cell seeding into a scaffold  [2], transfer metabolites  [3,4], deliver drugs or growth factors  [5], and provide a sufficient regeneration space for newly formed tissue  [6]. However, recent studies have shown that a native tissue cannot be represented by a homogeneous structure; rather, it is a multi-scale structure  [7]. For example, Karageorgiou et al.  [8] found that larger pores resulted in substantial bone ingrowth, whereas smaller pores resulted in ingrowth of non-mineralized osteoid tissue.Various traditional fabrication methods are available for scaffold production, including salt leaching  [9], gas-foaming  [10], phase-separation followed by freeze-drying  [11], thermal induced phase separation  [12,13], and electrospinning  [14,15]. However, these techniques have limitations with regard to accurately controlling pore morphologies, sizes, interconnectivities, and spatial distributions. By comparison, more advanced additive manufacturing techniques (AMT), such as 3D printing  [16,17], fused deposition modeling  [18], rapid prototyping, selective laser sinter  [19], and stereolithography  [20,21], have been used to produce porous metallic/non-metallic scaffolds for tissue engineering. As compared with the conventional raw stock processing methods, AMT was found to greatly improve object fabrication by stacking 2D solid sheets of finite thicknesses in a layer-by-layer manner  [22].Recently, combinations of AMT and CAD methods were used to provide efficient solutions for scaffold fabrication. Bael et al.  [23] designed a porous structure CAD model for a polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold and fabricated it using a selective laser sintering technique. The product was a cubic open porous scaffold designed as a 3D lattice network with a pore size of 2 mm and strut sizes of 1 mm. However, this structure was too regular to achieve a given bio-mimetic target. Pasko et al.  [24] proposed a function-based method to construct regular and irregular porous structures, although this method might not be able to include combining different structures. They also proposed a transfinite interpolation of the shape of a unit cell using metamorphosis between two unit cells  [25]. Ohtake  [26] presented a multi-level partition of unity implicit surface to construct surface models from large sets of points. This approach could provide for considerable flexibility in choosing local shape functions and could represent sharp features by selecting appropriate shape functions.Compared with conventional CAD-based manual design methods, TPMS is an effective, although simple mathematical method for defining pore geometries. Moreover, conventional CAD design methods have limitations with regard to controlling the spatial distributions of heterogeneous pore architectures. However, according to the previous reports  [27–31], the TMPS method is a powerful solution for making pores for scaffold design. Although there have been many reports on TPMS-based structure design, few studies have considered combining different porous morphologies.Thus, in this paper, we propose two methods for hybridizing different TPMS-based structures for bio-mimetic design purposes. In Section  2, we introduce the mathematical methods used for multi-structure hybridization; in Section  3, various interesting examples are given; in Section  4, we discuss the properties and limitations of this method, and comparisons with other methods and new ideas for future research; and Section  5 provides our concluding remarks.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we proposed two methods to prepare heterogeneous porous tissue scaffolds for bio-mimetic design purposes. Our SF method can be used in those cases with simple transition boundaries, while our GRBF method can be used in more general cases. The resulting models were defined coincidentally within the function framework and hadC∞continuities. This allows for constructing a new structure comprising multiple substructures. With these resulting models, we can directly fabricate novel hybrid structures with high quality using AMT.
