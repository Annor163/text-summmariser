BackgroundThe association of genotyping information with common traits is not satisfactorily solved. One of the most complex traits is pain and association studies have failed so far to provide reproducible predictions of pain phenotypes from genotypes in the general population despite a well-established genetic basis of pain. We therefore aimed at developing a method able to prospectively and highly accurately predict pain phenotype from the underlying genotype.MethodsComplex phenotypes and genotypes were obtained from experimental pain data including four different pain stimuli and genotypes with respect to 30 reportedly pain relevant variants in 10 genes. The training data set was obtained in 125 healthy volunteers and the independent prospective test data set was obtained in 89 subjects. The approach involved supervised machine learning.ResultsThe phenotype–genotype association was reached in three major steps. First, the pain phenotype data was projected and clustered by means of emergent self-organizing map (ESOM) analysis and subsequent U-matrix visualization. Second, pain sub-phenotypes were identified by interpreting the cluster structure using classification and regression tree classifiers. Third, a supervised machine learning algorithm (Unweighted Label Rule generation) was applied to genetic markers reportedly modulating pain to obtain a complex genotype underlying the identified subgroups of subjects with homogenous pain response. This procedure correctly identified 80% of the subjects as belonging to an extreme pain phenotype in an independently and prospectively assessed cohort.ConclusionThe developed methodology is a suitable basis for complex genotype–phenotype associations in pain. It may provide personalized treatments of complex traits. Due to its generality, this new method should also be applicable to other association tasks except pain.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Human genotyping information elucidates pathogenetic mechanisms and provides clinical guidance for disease management. However, the association of genotyping information with common traits is not resolved satisfactorily [1]. Especially in complex traits emerging from multifactorial mechanisms, single genetic variants often produce only small effect sizes [2]. This weakens the utility of genotyping information [1,3].One of the most challenging traits is pain. It involves a complex pathophysiology [4] underlying its sensory, affective, motor, vegetative and emotional components [5] reflected in the large network of underlying molecular nociceptive pathways [6]. The genetic basis of pain has been well established [7–9]. However, so far, association studies largely failed to provide reproducible predictions of phenotypes from genotypes in the average population [10]. Roughly this is caused by common genetic factors reciprocally canceling out their phenotypic consequences [11] and usually exerting only small effects [12]. To these poor results probably adds that current analytical methods for genotype phenotype association in pain are often insufficient. While the complexity of pain is increasingly accepted [13], its high-dimensional phenotypes [14] and underlying genotypes [11] are mainly subjected to low-dimensional analyses. Indeed, it becomes clear that it is advantageous to view pain as a complex phenotype when clustering individuals for their responses to different pain tests [15–17]. However, approaches applied so far have failed to provide a conclusive solution to pain genotype–phenotype association problems. This is probably due to a number of methodological shortcomings. Firstly, theoretical reasons suggest that the presently used clustering techniques should be revised in favor of those that make no prior assumptions about the cluster structure, since the patterns of pain responses across different tests provide no indication of a particular cluster form. Secondly, clustering approaches used so far have been restricted to a mere description of the pattern of pain measures among individuals, without providing analyses of clinically relevant phenotypes that could be used for predictions by genotypes (for example, see [16], page 3, Table 1). Thirdly, genotype associations were mostly made in separate tests of single markers for phenotypic effects, without regard to the complexity of the genotypes [11].Nowadays, more sophisticated bioinformatics tools are available to successfully approach this complex problem. Besides automated clustering of complex data, the bioinformatics toolbox also contains machine leaning methods for a subsequent knowledge-generation out of the clustering. In the present work, we aimed at developing a methodology that provides a basis for genotype–phenotype associations in complex traits. The methodology was developed to address several shortcomings of current approaches to genotype–phenotype associations and was presently applied to the complex trait of pain. It incorporates the complexity of both pain phenotypes and pain genotypes and is able to identify subgroups of individuals with similar pain phenotypes who share genotypic markers. We show that complex genotypes allow for correct prospective identification of up to 80% of the subjects who belong to a particular pain phenotype cluster. However, as a limited set of genotypes and phenotypes was used, the intention of this analysis rather was to pursue a clear methodological focus for the identification of complex genotypes and phenotypes and their associations than to identify new genotypes as a biological explanation of the observed pain phenotypes.
