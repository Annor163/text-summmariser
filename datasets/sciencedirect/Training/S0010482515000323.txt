@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study presents a new real-time heartbeat detection algorithm using the geometric angle between two consecutive samples of single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The angle was adopted as a new index representing the slope of ECG signal. The method consists of three steps: elimination of high-frequency noise, calculation of the angle of ECG signal, and detection of R-waves using a simple adaptive thresholding technique. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, QT database, European ST-T database, T-wave alternans database and synthesized ECG signals were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare with the results of other methods suggested in literature. The proposed method shows a high detection rate—99.95% of the sensitivity, 99.95% of the positive predictivity, and 0.10% of the fail detection rate on the four databases. The result shows that the proposed method can yield better or comparable performance than other literature despite the relatively simple process. The proposed algorithm needs only a single-lead ECG, and involves a simple and quick calculation. Moreover, it does not require post-processing to enhance the detection. Thus, it can be effectively applied to various real-time healthcare and medical devices.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the recording of the electrical activity of the heart which is non-invasively measured. The ECG is important in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease because it provides critical information about ischemic heart diseases, arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis [1]. The system that automatically analyzes the ECG firstly requires accurate heartbeat detection prior to identify the diagnosis parameters of the cardiovascular disease [2–6].Numerous heartbeat detection algorithms that can be applied to automatic diagnosis systems have been proposed. Existing methods have used derivative-based algorithms [2,5,7,8], wavelet transforms [3,6,9,10], filter bank [11], Hilbert transform [12,13], matched filters [14,15], artificial neural networks [14,16–18], and hidden Markov models [17,19,20]. Using a different concept, phasor transform was also applied for automatic delineation of fiducial points of single-lead ECG [21]. Most of the previous methods have produced excellent results in heartbeat detection.However, these methods have complex pre- and/or post-processing procedure, and they need too many parameters for calculation [4,15]. In addition, some methods require multi-lead ECG signals [22], or additional training or a reference signal in order to enhance the detection performance [14,17]. Increasing of the computational complexity and cost in algorithm is hindered real-time implementation. Furthermore, their performance is seriously affected by various noises, such as baseline wandering, and high frequency noise [2,5].This study presents a computationally efficient and accurate method for the heartbeat (actually R-peak) detection based on the geometric angle between two consecutive samples of single-lead ECG signal. It is a new approach for detecting the heartbeat that uses the angle between two consecutive samples without the amplitude or morphology of the ECG. Its primary advantage is that it can accurately emphasize the QRS complex without being influenced by variations in amplitude, width, or the morphology of the QRS complex. Moreover, it yields high detection rates despite the relatively simple process. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for the real-time automated diagnosis, the various real-time healthcare and medical devices.
