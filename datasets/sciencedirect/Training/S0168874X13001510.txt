@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A new approach for extracting stress intensity factors (SIFs) by the element-free Galerkin (EFG) class of methods through a modified crack closure integral (MCCI) scheme is proposed. Its primary feature is that it allows accurate calculation of mode I and mode II SIFs with a relatively simple and straightforward analysis even when a coarser nodal density is employed. The details of the adoption of the MCCI technique in the EFG method are described. Its performance is demonstrated through a number of case studies including mixed-mode and thermal problems in linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The results are compared with published theoretical solutions and those based on the displacement method, stress method, crack closure integral in conjunction with local smoothing (CCI–LS) technique, as well as the M-integral method. Its advantages are discussed.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Meshfree methods (MMs) were developed to overcome some of the difficulties of solid mechanics in analyzing certain type of problems using traditional computational tools like the finite element methods (FEMs) and boundary element methods (BEMs) [1]. One class of problems, for example, involves the propagation of a crack front where extensive remeshing is often required. Unlike mesh-based methods, MMs do not require discretization. Furthermore, the shape functions of MMs are higher order continuous [2] than that of the FEM. These shape functions are well suited for applications involving crack analysis. The EFG method [3–6], which is one of the formulations of MMs and widely applied for solid mechanics problems, is of concern here.The shape functions of the EFG method are obtained from a moving least-squares (MLS) approximation [7]. Their continuity is dependent on the continuity of the weight functions used. To model a discontinuity in the geometry arising out of a crack, the weight functions are appropriately modified. There exist several strategies to model strong discontinuities [8–12]. However, most methods need large nodal densities to obtain an accurate solution. One approach, which does not require large nodal densities, involves partition-of-unity enrichment of targeted nodal shape functions. The pertinent examples include Heaviside/jump functions and the Williams' crack-tip displacement solutions [13] to model the discontinuity and capture the singularity at the crack tip respectively. These were adopted from the eXtended finite element method (XFEM) [14–16] and gave rise to development of the eXtended element-free Galerkin (XEFG) method [17]. Although this method does not require large nodal densities, it introduces additional nodal degrees of freedom in the global system of equations.SIFs play a pivotal role in the application of LEFM principles. Although there are a variety of techniques available in FEM and BEM such as the displacement method [18], stress method [19], the stiffness derivative procedure [20], J-integral [21] and crack closure integral (CCI) [22–25] to extract the SIFs, only few techniques find their adoption in MMs. The displacement and stress methods are the earliest and simplest methods to extract the SIFs. Nevertheless, their accuracy depends on the density of the mesh. Also, crack opening displacement (COD) required for the displacement method is not directly available in the XEFG method. The J-integral is accurate but relatively computationally expensive when it comes to the extraction of the SIFs in a mixed-mode problem. The interaction integral/M-integral [26], derived from the J-integral, is widely used for extracting the mixed-mode SIFs in MMs. However, they require knowledge of the auxiliary displacement and stress field solutions which are material dependent. The CCI approach is rarely used within the framework of MMs despite the fact that it is simple to implement, accurate and offers computationally easier ways of mode separation. Previously, CCI was calculated by inserting a high stiffness spring [27] or enclosing an auxiliary FE zone around the crack tip [28]. Lately, the CCI has been combined with a local smoothing technique to compute SIFs accurately in isotropic [29] and functionally graded materials [30].The MCCI or virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) has been in existence for a long time and it has been exploited abundantly in FEM and, to a lesser extent, in BEM to extract the SIFs. Its adoption in MMs is not that straightforward because it requires the knowledge of crack closure forces. In this paper, a novel method to extract the nodal forces in the presence of regular nodal discretization in EFG methods is described. The closure nodal forces at the crack tip and at nodes ahead of it are multiplied with the opening displacements at the corresponding nodes behind the tip to obtain the strain energy release rates (SERRs). To bring out the special issues associated with the adoption, a number of case studies, involving crack face and thermal loadings, are solved. Thereby the procedural details, effectiveness and accuracy obtainable are presented. In order to emphasize the effectiveness and accuracy of the method, the results obtained by the method are compared with those obtained by the popular M-integral technique, analytical solutions and, wherever possible, by the CCI–LS [29].The outline of the paper is as follows: The formulation of the EFG method and various crack modeling techniques are presented in Section 2. In Section 3, the MCCI technique to extract the SIFs for EFG methods is presented. Additionally, other popular techniques such as M-integral, CCI–LS, displacement and stress methods are briefly described in Section 4. Section 5 gives a detail analysis on accurate extraction of nodal forces. In Section 6, the MCCI and other techniques are applied to a variety of problems to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. This is followed by concluding remarks in Section 7.In MMs, the domain is discretized with nodes. Each node interacts with other nodes through weight functions which may vary in size and profile.Fig. 1(a) shows a geometry discretized with nodes with regular circular weight functions. In the EFG method, any scalar field variable, u(x), can be represented as(1)u(x)=∑I=1nΦI(x)uIwhere ΦI(x) in Eq. (1) are the nodal shape functions and are approximants and not interpolants as in the case of FEM. uIare the nodal field values.The moving least squares (MLS) technique [7] is used to develop the shape functions in the EFG method. The polynomial basis,p=[1xy], is used here. The cubic B-spline with circular domain of influence (dI), as shown in Fig. 1(b), is used as the weight function.(2)w(r)={23−4r2+4r3,r≤1243−4r+4r2−43r3,12<r≤10,r>1where r is the radial distance of point x from node I, and is obtained as a function of the characteristic size, dI, of node I.In this paper, the crack is modelled by two approaches (1) modification of the weight function (2) and by the Extended element-free Galerkin method (XEFG) based on extrinsic partition-of-unity (PU) enrichment.The first technique to account for strong discontinuities, in MMs, was the visibility method (Fig. 2(a)). The shape functions of the nodes closer to the crack tip are discontinuous, using the visibility method, leading to a poor crack tip stress field. To overcome this difficulty, the diffraction method was developed where the weight function for a node close to the crack tip ‘diffracts’ around the crack tip (Fig. 2(b)).The modified distance in the diffracted region is given by(3)r=(s1+s2(x)s0(x))λs0(x)where x is the sampling point, xIis the node and xcis the crack tip. s0(x)=||x−xI||, s1(x)=||xI−xc|| and s2(x)=||x−xc||. The parameter λ is mostly set to either 1 or 2. In this work, it is set at 2.The displacement approximation [17] in XEFG method is obtained by partition-of-unity enrichment of the MLS shape functions. The Heaviside function is used to describe the displacement discontinuity. The local region around the crack tip is enriched with Williams' expansion. The displacement variable, u(x), is expressed as(4)u(x)=∑I∈w(x)ΦI(x)uI+∑I∈wj(x)ΦI(x){aIH(f(x))}+∑I∈wb(x)ΦI(x)∑k=14bIkΨkenr(r,θ)where f(x) is the signed distance function from the crack line. The set w includes all the normal nodes, wbincludes the nodes that are branch enriched and wjincludes the nodes that are jump enriched that influence the point x. The normal and enriched nodes are shown inFig. 3.The Heaviside/jump enriched function H(f(x)) and branch enriched function Ψenr(r,θ) are given by(5)H(f(x))=1iff(x)≥0−1iff(x)<0Ψenr(r,θ)=[rSinθ2,rCosθ2,rSinθ2Sinθ,rCosθ2Sinθ]where r and θ are polar coordinates with respect to the crack tip. The COD is expressed in terms of the jump and branch enrichment functions:(6)uCOD+−uCOD−=2{∑I∈wj(x)ΦI(x)aI+∑I∈wb(x)ΦI(x)∑j=14bIjΨj(r,π)}whereuCOD+anduCOD−are top and bottom crack face displacement vector respectively anduCOD={uCOD,vCOD}.The shape functions of the EFG method are non polynomial in nature. Moreover, the presence of enrichment functions in XEFG method necessitates higher order of Gauss integration, especially in a small region around the crack.Therefore, a small region, as shown inFig. 4, is divided into many smaller triangles to facilitate sub-domain integration. Essentially this helps to increase the number of Gauss points by dividing the regular rectangular cells into smaller triangles. Also, crisscrossing of the crack edge by rectangular background mesh is avoided by sub-triangulation.The SERR associated with a crack extension is equal to the work done in closing a crack that is extended back to its original configuration. It can be calculated through Irwin's crack closure integral (Fig. 5), given by(7)GI=limΔa→012Δa∫0Δaσyy(x)vCOD(x−Δa)dxGII=limΔa→012Δa∫0Δaτxy(x)uCOD(x−Δa)dxwhere Δa is the crack tip elemental length in FEM.Although the displacement method is a simple technique available to obtain the SIFs, their accuracy can be significantly improved by calculations involving energy release rates. This was clearly shown in the context of FEM [25]. There are many techniques available to calculate the SERR using Eq. (7). Direct numerical Gauss integration, universal crack closure integral (UCCI) [31], CCI–LS technique [29,32], MCCI/VCCT [22–25] etc., are some of the ways through which SERR, and thereby SIFs, can be obtained. The MCCI technique is particularly convenient as it is relatively simple to implement. This technique was successfully applied in the realm of fracture mechanics in composites [33]. Also, mixed-mode SIFs are easily separated.The MCCI/VCCT, in the FEM, requires the calculation of crack closure forces and corresponding CODs to find the SIFs in the context of the LEFM. This paper proposes a new approach for extracting crack closure forces, for the application of the MCCI technique, within the framework of the EFG method. The CODs are extracted from the crack face nodal displacement solution. Consequently the SERR, which is a function of nodal forces and CODs, is obtained.Consider a crack at an arbitrary inclination, θ, to the X-axis, as shown inFig. 6. A regular nodal discretization where the nodes align with the crack line near the crack tip is used.The main issue related to the adoption of the MCCI technique in the EFG method is to calculate the crack closure forces at nodes along the crack plane. This is done by splitting the domain of influence (dI) for a node j, along the direction of the crack front, as shown inFig. 7(a). The stiffness matrix for one of the regions, either the upper or the lower one is obtained. This matrix is multiplied with the nodal displacement vector to obtain the crack closure/nodal reaction force.Fig. 7(b) shows the upper section of the node j. The stiffness matrix for the upper region, denoted by a Ω+ sign, is established by the following equation:(8)KIJΩ+=∫ABITDBJtdA;I,J∈wΩ+(x)where B is a strain–displacement matrix and t is the thickness. Here, it is also a function of the crack front orientation. The set wΩ+(x) includes only those nodes which are on and above the crack line. Similarly, the stiffness matrix(KIJΩ−)for the lower section is established by considering the nodes on and below the crack line.The strain–displacement matrix, B, for classical EFG methods including the visibility and the diffraction method is given by(9)B=Bstd=[Φ1,x0...Φi,x0...Φn,x00Φ1,y...0Φi,y...0Φn,yΦ1,yΦ1,x...Φi,yΦi,x...Φn,yΦn,x]where i indicates the node number, either in the top section or the bottom section, in the domain of influence of the current node j at which the force is extracted. However, for the XEFG method, the B matrix also comprises of extra terms due to the enrichment. Therefore B, for enriched EFG method, is given by(10)B=[Bstd|Benr]Bi,kenr=[Φi,xΨk+ΦiΨk,x00Φi,yΨk+ΦiΨk,yΦi,yΨk+ΦiΨk,yΦi,xΨk+ΦiΨk,x]whereBi,kenrmatrix comprises of the derivatives of the regular shape functions and the enrichment functions of the enriched nodes.The integral in Eq. (8) is calculated by numerical integration. Since circular domains of influence are used here, either the top or the bottom section of the domain of influence is sub-divided into smaller triangles (Fig. 8) to carry out accurate Gauss integration. The Gauss points to suit integration of 8th order complete polynomial [34], are indicated by star markers. X−Y is the global axis and x−y is the local axis at the crack tip; +x indicates the direction of crack extension.Even if the domain of influence is not circular, the top or the bottom regions of the crack line can be sub-divided for accurate calculation of the stiffness matrix. It is recommended to use higher order integration to calculate the crack forces accurately. The Gauss integration is carried out using(11)∫ABITDBJtdA=∑iBIT(ξi)DBJ(ξi)widetJ(ξi)twhere ξiis the Gauss point, wiis the Gauss weight and det J(ξi) is the determinant of the Jacobian of the background triangular element at ξi.The nodal force vector is calculated by(12)F=KΩ+UΩ+where UΩ+ is the nodal displacement vector of the nodes contained in Ω+.The nodal force vector is also extracted at node j+1 by following the same procedure as mentioned above. The obtained forces are transformed to the local crack tip coordinates (Fig. 9) through the following relation:(13){F}xy=[T]{F}XYT=[cosθ−sinθsinθcosθ]where {F}xy={Fx,Fy}, {F}XY={FX,FY} and θ is the angle at which the crack front is inclined to theXaxis. In the XEFG method, contributions of additional forces due to branch enrichment are also taken into account.The SERR are subsequently given by(14)GI=12χj,j-2[FjyvCODj-2+Fj+1yvCODj-1]GII=12χj,j-2[FjxuCODj-2+Fj+1xuCODj-1]where χj,j−2 is the distance between jth and j−2th nodes (Fig. 10). The denominator in Eq. (14), χj,j−2, is analogous to the virtual crack extension length, Δa, used for MCCI/VCCT analysis, in the context of the FEM, where it is the length along the crack plane in which the crack is assumed to extend.A general MCCI equation for extracting SERR, involving calculation of forces at n nodal points along the crack line can be written as(15)GI=12χj,j−n∑i=0n−1Fj+iyvCODj−n+iGII=12χj,j−n∑i=0n−1Fj+ixuCODj−n+iAs n increases in Eq. (15), the accuracy of the SERR increases. This is clearly demonstrated through a case study in Section 6.1.1.In presence of crack face loading, the newly formed crack faces are also subjected to loading as shown inFig. 11. Therefore, additional work has to be done to close the extended crack. The SERRs, in such a case, are then given by(16)GI=12χj,j−2[(Fjy+Fj−2y)vCODj−2+(Fj+1y+Fj−1y)vCODj−1]GII=12χj,j−2[(Fjx+Fj−2x)uCODj−2+(Fj+1x+Fj−1x)uCODj−1]where, with reference to Fig. 10, there are now crack face load Fj−1 and Fj−2, due to distributed load tc, acting at nodes j−1 and j−2 respectively.The mechanical strain,εijm, when thermal strain is present, is related to the total strain,εijt, by(17)εijm=(εijt−α⁎ΔTδij)where α⁎ is the coefficient of thermal expansion and ΔT is the temperature difference. Therefore, the resulting stiffness matrix is given by(18)KIJmech=KIJtotal−KIJthermalKIJtotal=∫ABITDBJtdA;I,J∈wΩ+(x)KIJthermal=∫ABITDα⁎{ΔTΔT0}tdAThe resulting mechanical stiffness matrix,KIJmech, is then multiplied with the nodal displacement vector to obtain the residual nodal forces.The M-integral/interaction integral [26] which is based upon the J-integral [21] is frequently used to calculate the mixed-mode SIFs, in fracture problems, within the realm of MMs. In the presence of a crack face [35] and a thermal loading [36], this integral is given by(19)M=∫A(σijui,1aux+σijauxui,1−σikεikauxδ1j)q,jdA+∫Aσijauxα(ΔT),1δij)qdA−∫Γc++ΓC−tjuj,1auxqdΓσijaux,εikaux,anduiauxare auxiliary state values that correspond to the established theoretical solutions. Eq. (19) is numerically calculated, by Gauss quadrature, over the area A. For 2D problem, the M-integral is also equal to(20)M=(2KIKIaux+2KIIKIIaux)E⁎where E⁎ is E for plane stress and E/(1−υ2) for plane strain. KIis evaluated by settingKIauxto unity andKIIauxto zero. Similarly KIIis evaluated by settingKIIauxto unity andKIauxto zero.Recently, a method based on the CCI in conjunction with a local smoothing technique (CCI–LS) was used to calculate the SIFs in XEFG method [29]. Although, this method is simple and yields accurate results, the accuracy of the SIFs depend on the Gauss quadrature order used for background integration cells. The results obtained by the proposed MCCI technique are compared with the results of the CCI–LS technique to demonstrate the superiority of the MCCI technique.In addition to M-integral and CCI–LS methods, the SIFs obtained by the displacement and stress methods are compared with those of the MCCI technique. In the displacement method and stress method, the computed COD behind the crack tip and stress ahead of the crack tip are compared with the corresponding theoretical crack tip solution to obtain the SIFs. More details on these methods can be found in [29].Consider a bar of uniform cross section, A, of unit area and of unit length, L, as shown inFig. 12. The bar is subjected to a point tensile load, P, of 10MPa at its end. This problem is solved using 1D analysis with displacement (ux) set to zero at the origin.The bar is discretized with different nodal distributions. The domain of influence (dI) of each node is constant and is set at 1.75(L/(n−1)) where n is the total number of nodes. Here n is equal to 11.The force at the node of interest, j, can be extracted in two ways (I or II) as shown inFig. 13. Either way, the stiffness matrix is established by the following relation(21)K=∫lBTDBAdxwhere l=l−=l+=1.75(L/(n−1)). D is the Young's modulus, A is the area of the cross section and B is the standard strain–displacement matrix given by(22)BI=ΦI,xThe goal, here is to extract the force accurately at node located at x=0.5 ( i.e., the center of the bar). Four nodal discretization configurations, as shown inFig. 14, are considered for the analysis. The effect of location of the adjacent nodes to the node, j, (darkened node) on the force extraction is also studied. The first configuration (a) consists of equally spaced nodes while others ((b), (c) and (d)) have the adjacent nodes, to node of interest, altered from the regular locations. The altered node locations are indicated.The force (F) at the node, j, is extracted using Eq. (12).Table 1 shows the force obtained for different configurations for an applied load P. It is clear that the error in calculated forces FIand FIIis zero for configuration (a) with equally spaced nodes. Although the error increases with an increase in the unstructured distribution of nodes (configuration (b), (c) and (d)) near the node j, the averaged magnitude of the computed force (F) had a relatively lower error. Therefore, for all subsequent analysis, the average magnitude of the force was used for the analysis, given by(23)F=12(Kl−Ul−−Kl+Ul+)

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A simple and an accurate way of extracting mixed-mode stress intensity factors within the framework of EFG method, based on the visibility and diffraction approaches, and the XEFG method is presented. It involves computing crack closure forces only at two nodes, the crack tip and a node ahead of it, and extraction of opening displacements at two nodes behind the crack tip. The effectiveness and special issues associated with the adoption of the MCCI/VCCT have been brought out through solutions to a comprehensive range of crack problems including crack face and thermal loadings. The study has facilitated a comparison between the classical displacement and stress methods and the MCCI/VCCT, with the popular M-integral method, CCI–LS technique and analytical solutions. The accuracy of the displacement method is acceptable only when it is employed in conjunction with the enrichment functions. The accuracy of the MCCI/VCCT is consistently good and is comparable to that of the M-integral method. These case studies establish this approach as a viable technique for extracting the SIFs for practical problems.
