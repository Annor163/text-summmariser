@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Meca et al. (2004) studied a class of inventory games which arise when a group of retailers who observe demand for a common item decide to cooperate and make joint orders with the EOQ policy. In this paper, we extend their model to the situation where retailer’s delay in payments is permitted by the supplier. We introduce the corresponding inventory game with permissible delay in payments, and prove that its core is nonempty. Then, a core allocation rule is proposed which can be reached through population monotonic allocation scheme. Under this allocation rule, the grand coalition is shown to be stable from a farsighted point of view.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The inventory games were introduced by Meca, Timmer, García-Jurado, and Borm (2004). This class of games arises when a group of retailers who observe demand for a common item decide to cooperate and make joint orders. By placing joint orders, these retailers can reduce their purchase cost and transaction-related cost due to economies of scale and transaction cost economics (Schotanus, Telgen, & de Boer, 2010). This kind of horizontal cooperation is becoming increasingly popular in the economic world since the supply chain arena has undergone radical changes in recent years with increasing emphasis on cooperation and information sharing. A very recent survey on cooperation among supply chain agents can be seen in Nagarajan and Sos̆ić (2008), Meca and Timmer (2008).In this paper, we extend the inventory cost games studied in Meca et al. (2004) to the situation with permissible delay in payments. Permissible delay in payments (trade credit) is very common in supply chain transactions. For retailers, the benefits that they can obtain from permissible delay in payments are obvious. For example, retailers can take advantage of permissible delay in payments as a source of financing when they are short of cash. Especially, small and medium-sized firms who have difficult access to external financing may largely rely on trade credit as a main source of short-term funds. Moreover, once delay in payments is permitted for retailers, the amount of time that retailers’ capital invests in stock is reduced, which accordingly leads to a reduction in retailers’ stock-holding cost. For suppliers, permissible delay in payments can promote their sales and reduce their on-hand stock level. According to Rajan and Zingales (1995), the volume of trade credit in aggregate represents 17.8% of total assets for US firms, 22% for UK firms, and more than 25% for countries such as Germany, France and Italy. Therefore, in today’s business transactions, trade credit is one of the most important source of short-term external financing for firms in a broad range of industries and economies (Fisman, 2001).Beranek (1967) emphasized the importance of paying attention to credit terms when making lot sizing decisions and gave examples to illustrate that ignoring financial considerations will lead to an infeasible stocking policy. Since then, there appeared extensive literatures on trade credit and inventory policy. Goyal (1985) suggested a mathematical model for obtaining the economic order quantity under permissible delay in payments. Aggarwal and Jaggi (1995) considered the inventory model with an exponential deterioration rate under the condition of permissible delay in payments. Jamal, Sarker, and Wang (1997) extended this issue with allowable shortage. However, Jamal et al. (1997) did not provide an accurate and reliable procedure to find the optimal solutions. Chung and Huang (2009) extended Goyal’s model by considering allowable shortage and presented a theorem to determine the optimal order quantity. Teng (2002) amended Goyal’s model by considering the difference between unit price and unit cost, and found that the economic replenishment interval and order quantity decrease when delay in payments is permitted in certain cases. Many other models dealing with trade credit problems can be seen in Liao, Tsai, and Su (2000), Song and Cai (2006), Chung and Huang (2003), Ouyang, Teng, and Chen (2006), Lee and Rhee (2011), and references therein.Our paper is also related to the vast literature on applications of cooperative game theory in the area of inventory management. To the best of our knowledge, Hartman (1994) first applied cooperative game theory to study methods of allocating inventory costs and benefits. Since then, cooperative game theory is widely applied in this area. For example, the application of cooperative game theory to continuous-review inventory model with (Q, r ) replenishment policy (Hartman & Dror, 1996), to economic order quantity models (see Meca, García-Jurado, and Borm (2003), Meca, Guardiola, and Toledo (2007) and Dror and Hartman (2007)), to economic lot-sizing models (see van den Heuvel, Borm, and Hamers (2007) and Guardiola, Meca, and Puerto (2008, 2009), among others), to newsvendor models (see Hartman, Dror, and Shaked (2000), Muller, Scarsini, and Shaked (2002), Hartman and Dror (2005), Slikker, Fransoo, and Wouters (2005), Özen, Fransoo, Norde, and Slikker (2008), Özen, Erikip, and Slikker (2012), Chen and Zhang (2009), and the many references therein), and also to inventory transportation systems (see Fiestras-Janeiro, García-Jurado, Meca, and Mosquera (2011a, 2013)). Dror and Hartman (2010), Fiestras-Janeiro, García-Jurado, Meca, and Mosquera (2011b) reviewed the applications of cooperative game theory to inventory management. These literature mostly focus on examining the existence of the core of the corresponding game, which analyzes the stability of the grand coalition from a myopic point of view. There are other literature applying the concept of Largest Consistent Set (LCS) to analyze coalition stability in supply chain from the farsighted perspective, for example, Granot and Sošić (2005), Sošić (2006), Nagarajan and Sošić (2007, 2009). In this paper, we will examine the core of inventory games with permissible delay in payments, as well as the farsighted stability of the grand coalition.The contribution of our paper is threefold. First, we introduce the inventory game with permissible delay in payments and show that the core of this kind of game is non-empty. Second, we propose a cost allocation rule that is in the core which can be reached through population monotonic allocation schemes. Third, we examine the stability of grand coalition from a farsighted perspective, and show that grand coalition belongs to the largest consistent set, i.e., it is a farsighted stable outcome under the proposed cost allocation rule.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We start by introducing preliminaries on cooperative game theory in Section 2. In Section 3 we introduce the inventory model with permissible delay in payments under independent and cooperative purchase respectively. Section 4 presents the inventory game with permissible delay in payments. We offer concluding remarks in Section 5.A transferable utility game (a TU-game) is a pair(N,c), where N is a finite set of players and c is the characteristic function defined from the family of subsets of N withc(∅)=0. For any givenS⊆N,c(S)is defined as the minimal total cost that the members of S can achieve when they cooperate. A TU-game is said to be subadditive ifc(S∪R)⩽c(S)+c(R)for eachS,R⊂Nsuch thatS∩R=∅. Clearly, there exists an incentive to cooperate in subadditive games with transferable utilities.An allocation is a function x from N toRthat assigns an amount of cost to each member of N. For eachx=(x1,…,xn)∈RN,xjis the cost allocated to retailer j, andx(S)is the total amount allocated to coalitionS⊂Nwherex(S)=∑j∈Sxj. An allocationx∈RNis efficient ifx(N)=c(N), and is individually rational if each player is charged less by joining the coalition than working alone, that is,xi⩽c({i})for eachi∈N. An imputation is an efficient and individually rational allocation. The set of all imputation of a TU-game(N,c)is denoted byI(N,c)={x∈RN|x(N)=c(N)andxi⩽c({i})foreachi∈N}The core of a TU-game(N,c)is the subset of all imputationsx∈I(N,c)that no coalition has an incentive to split off from the grand coalition and form subcoalitions, i.e.,x(S)⩽c(S). Allocations belonging to the core will be called core allocations in the rest of this paper. We denote the set of core allocations for the TU-game(N,c)byCore(c), that is,Core(c)=x∈RN|∑j∈Nxj=c(N),∑j∈Sxj⩽c(S)for everyS⊂N,S≠∅A cost game(N,c)has a non-empty core if and only if it is balanced; it is a totally balanced game if the core of every subgame is non-empty.A population monotonic allocation scheme (PMAS), was introduced by Sprumont (1990) and defined as follows. For a TU-game(N,c), a vectoryS∈RSis a PMAS if and only if it satisfies the following two conditions. First, for allS⊂N,S≠∅,yS(S)=c(S). Second, for allS⊂R⊂N,i∈S,yiS⩾yiR. It follows from Sprumont (1990) that each cost game with PMAS is totally balanced. An allocation x for TU-game(N,c)can be reached through a PMAS if there exists a PMAS(yS)∅≠S⊂Nsuch thatyiN=xifor alli∈N.As Chwe (1994) points out, membership in the core provides a kind of stability from myopic view. The idea behind the core is that if a subset of players can benefit by defecting from the grand coalition with one step, then the grand coalition is considered to be unstable. However, it precludes the possibility that an initial defection may trigger a sequence of further moves, which eventually can lead to an outcome wherein the players who initiated the deviations would receive higher cost than that they would obtain in the grand coalition. Therefore, farsighted players may not choose to defect in the first place, and thus the grand coalition, which appeared unstable from a myopic view, may actually be stable from a farsighted point of view. A new solution concept, the largest consistent set (LCS), which allows players to look ahead and consider possible further deviations, was introduced by Chwe (1994). Basically, the largest consistent set approaches stability analysis from a farsighted perspective, i.e., considers the effect of externalities and allows players to consider multiple possible further deviations, while the core approaches stability analysis from a myopic perspective, i.e., considers only one step deviation. In this paper, we will analyze coalition stability using both the core and the largest consistent set. The definition of the largest consistent set is below.ByLwe denote coalition structures whereLis a partition of the player setN={1,2,…,n}, (i.e.,L={L1,L2,…,Lm}such that∪i=1mLi=NandLi∩Lj=∅,i≠j). For two coalition structuresL1,L2, we say that play i strongly prefers coalition structureL2toL1, i.e.,L1≺iL2if the cost allocated to him/her underL2is strictly lower than underL1. In other words,L1≺iL2⇔xiL2<xiL1, wherexiLdenotes player i’s cost under coalition structureL. For coalitionS,L1≺SL2, ifL1≺iL2for alli∈S. By⇀Swe denote the following relation:L1⇀SL2if the coalition structureL2is obtained when S deviates from coalition structureL1. We say thatL1is directly dominated byL2, i.e.,L1<L2if there exists a coalition S such thatL1⇀SL2andL1≺SL2. We say thatL1is indirectly dominated byLm, i.e.,L1≪Lmif there existL1,L2,…,LmandS1,S2,…,Smsuch thatLi⇀SiLi+1andLi≺SiLmfori=1,2,…,m-1.A setYis called consistent if the following condition holds:L∈Yif and only if for allL^,Csuch thatL⇀CL^there existsB∈YwhereL^=BorL^≪Bsuch thatL⊀CB. Chwe (1994) shows that although there can be many consistent sets, there uniquely exists a Largest Consistent Set, which contains all other consistent sets. The largest consistent set has the merit of “ruling out with confidence”, that is, if an outcome is not in the largest consistent set, it cannot possibly be stable. The largest consistent set is the set of all outcomes that can possibly be stable.We consider a set of retailersN={1,2,…,n}who observe the demand of a common item. The parameters associated to each retaileri∈Nare:Di>0: demand rate per unit timepi>0: unit selling pricehi>0: unit stock-holding cost per unit time.The parameters that are common to all retailers are:α>0: unit purchasing costK>0: fixed ordering cost per orderIe⩾0: interest earned per $ per unit timeIk⩾0: opportunity cost per $ per unit timeM⩾0: fixed period of permissible delay in settling accounts.In addition, the following assumptions are made in the model: (1) It is a two echelon supply chain with a single supplier and n retailers; (2) The demand rate for all retailers are known, constant and continuous; (3) The replenishment lead time is zero for all retailers; (4) Shortages are not allowed for all retailers; and (5) The supplier provides all retailers with a fixed credit period M to settle their accounts. During the credit period M, retailers can earn interest with rateIeafter they accumulate revenue from their customers, while they incurs a capital opportunity cost with rateIkfor the items in stock after they pay off all purchasing cost to the supplier.When retailers place orders independently, the total cost per unit time for retailer i is a function of the order cycleTithat can be written asTCi(Ti)=TCi1(Ti),ifTi⩾MTCi2(Ti),ifTi<Mwhere(1)TCi1(Ti)=KTi+hiDiTi2+αIkDi(Ti-M)22Ti-piIeDiM22Tiis the sum of the ordering cost per unit time, the holding cost per unit time, the opportunity cost per unit time, and minus the interest earned per unit time, and(2)TCi2(Ti)=KTi+hiDiTi2-piIeDiM-Ti2is the sum of the ordering cost per unit time, the holding cost per unit time, and minus the interest earned per unit time.In Teng (2002), for instance, the analysis of this model can be found. Following that paper, the optimal order cycleTi∗which minimizesTCi(Ti)is given by:Ti∗=2K+DiM2αIk-piIehi+αIkDi,ifΔi⩾02Khi+piIeDi,ifΔi<0whereΔ{i}=K-hi+piIeDiM22.Thus, the total cost for retailer i can be expressed byTCi(Ti∗)=2K+DiM2αIk-piIe·hi+αIkDi-αIkDiM,ifΔi⩾02K·hi+piIeDi-piIeDiM,ifΔi<0When retailers decide to cooperate, they form a purchasing group to place their order jointly, but store their goods in their own warehouses. If the set of retailersS⊆Ndecide to cooperate, then they share a common order cycle lengthTS(Meca et al., 2004). The cost per unit time for the coalition S consists of the following elements:1.Fixed cost of placing orders together=KTS;Holding cost=∑i∈ShiDiTS2;Cost of interest charged for items sold after the permissible delay and interest earned from sales revenues received during the period M. Note that there are many different approaches to calculate the interest charged and the interest earned, such as the approaches introduced in Goyal (1985), Aggarwal and Jaggi (1995), Teng (2002). For simplicity and tractability, we use Goyal’s approach throughout this paper. Therefore, we have the following two possible cases for the computation of interest earned and charged.(a)M⩽TS. In this case, the interest charged per unit time is∑i∈SαIkDi(TS-M)22TS, and the interest earned per unit time is∑i∈SpiIeDiM22TS.M>TS. In this case, there is no interest charged, and the interest earned per unit time is∑i∈SpiIeDiM-TS2.Hence, the total cost per unit timeTCS(TS)is given byTCS(TS)=TCS1(TS),ifTS⩾MTCS2(TS),ifTS<Mwhere(3)TCS1(TS)=KTS+∑i∈ShiDiTS2+∑i∈SαIkDi(TS-M)22TS-∑i∈SpiIeDiM22TS,(4)TCS2(TS)=KTS+∑i∈ShiDiTS2-∑i∈SpiIeDiM-TS2.The next theorem gives the optimal ordering cycle length and the optimal cost obtained for coalition S.Theorem 3.1LetΔS=K-∑i∈S(hi+piIe)DiM22,ifΔS⩾0, the optimal order cycle length for the coalition S isTS∗=2K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)∑i∈S(hi+αIk)Di,and the total cost isTCSTS∗=2K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)·∑i∈S(hi+αIk)Di-∑i∈SαIkDiMifΔS<0, the optimal order cycle length for the coalition S isTS∗=2K∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di,and the total cost isTCSTS∗=2K·∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di-∑i∈SpiIeDiM.Eqs. (3) and (4) yield(5)dTCS1(TS)dTS=-1TS2K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)2+∑i∈S(hi+αIk)Di2,(6)d2TCS1(TS)dTS2=2TS3K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)2,(7)dTCS2(TS)dTS=-KTS2+∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di2,(8)d2TCS2(TS)dTS2=2KTS3>0.LetdTCS1(TS)dTS=0, we can obtain(9)TS1∗=2K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)∑i∈S(hi+αIk)Di,if2K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)⩾0.Eq. (9) gives the optimal value ofTSfor the case whenTS⩾Mso thatTS1∗⩾M. We substitute Eq. (9) intoTS1∗⩾M, then we can obtain thatTS1∗⩾Mif and only ifK-∑i∈S(hi+piIe)DiM22⩾0.Similarly, letdTCS2(TS)dTS=0we can obtain(10)TS2∗=2K∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di.Eq. (10) gives the optimal value ofTSfor the case whenTS<Mso thatTS2∗<M. We substitute Eq. (10) intoTS2∗<M, then we can obtain thatTS2∗<Mif and only ifK-∑i∈S(hi+piIe)DiM22<0.1.IfΔS⩾0, then2K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)⩾∑i∈SDiM2(hi+piIe)+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)=∑i∈SDiM2(hi+αIk)>0.Combining Eqs. (5) and (6), we conclude thatTS1∗exists, andTCS1(TS)is decreasing on[M,TS1∗), increasing on[TS1∗,+∞).It follows from Eq. (7) thatdTCS2(TS)dTS⩽∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di21-M2TS2⩽0,whenTS<M, that isTCS2(TS)is decreasing on(0,M).Furthermore,limTS→M-TCS(TS)=limTS→M+TCS(TS).Incorporating the above arguments, we have thatTCS(TS)is decreasing on(0,TS1∗)and increasing on[TS1∗,+∞), thenTS∗=TS1∗. Substituting Eq. (9) into Eq. (3), we haveTCSTS∗=TCS1(TS1∗)=2K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)·∑i∈S(hi+αIk)Di-∑i∈SαIkDiMIfΔS<0, Eq. (8) implies thatTCS2(TS)is decreasing on0,TS2∗and increasing on[TS2∗,M).It follows from Eq. (5) thatdTCS1(TS)dTS⩾∑i∈S(hi+αIk)Di21-M2TS2⩾0,whenTS⩾M, that isTCS1(TS)is increasing on[M,+∞).Therefore,TCS(TS)is decreasing on0,TS2∗and increasing on[TS2∗,+∞), thenTS∗=TS2∗. Substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (4), we haveTCSTS∗=TCS2TS2∗=2K·∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di-∑i∈SpiIeDiM.□Before comparing the total costs under independent ordering and joint ordering, we first introduce the following lemma.Lemma 3.2For∅≠S⊂R⊆N, the optimal order cycle length for the coalition S is not shorter than that of coalition R, that is,TS∗⩾TR∗.(a)WhenΔS<0, thenΔR<0, and it is easy to verify thatTS∗=2K∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di⩾2K∑i∈R(hi+piIe)Di=TR∗.WhenΔS⩾0andΔR<0, thenTR∗<M,TS∗=2K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)∑i∈S(hi+αIk)Di⩾M, henceTS∗⩾TR∗.WhenΔS⩾0andΔR⩾0, thenTR∗=2K+∑i∈RDiM2(αIk-piIe)∑i∈R(hi+αIk)Di⩾M. IfTS∗<TR∗, we have2K=∑i∈S(hi+αIk)DiTS∗2-DiM2(αIk-piIe)=∑i∈ShiDiTS∗2+piIeDiM2+αIkDi(TS∗2-M2)<∑i∈ShiDiTR∗2+piIeDiM2+αIkDi(TR∗2-M2)<∑i∈R[hiDiTR∗2+piIeDiM2+αIkDi(TR∗2-M2)]=2K.It is contradictory. Hence,TS∗⩾TR∗.□The above lemma indicates that the optimal cycle length for the larger coalition is not longer than that of the smaller coalition. Generally, shorter order is preferable, especially for those goods with perishability. Therefore, in the sense of ordering cycle length, the larger the coalition, the better. With the above lemma, we can further derive the following theorem.Theorem 3.3The total cost of joint ordering is less than the aggregate total cost of independent ordering, that is,TCN(TN∗)<∑i∈NTCi(Ti∗).(1)IfΔN<0, thenTN∗<M. We haveTCNTN∗=∑i∈N(hi+piIe)DiTN∗-∑i∈NpiIeDiM=∑i∈{j∈N:Δj<0}(hi+piIe)DiTN∗-piIeDiM+∑i∈{j∈N:Δj⩾0}(hi+piIe)DiTN∗-piIeDiM⩽∑i∈{j∈N:Δj<0}(hi+piIe)DiTi∗-piIeDiM+∑i∈{j∈N:Δj⩾0}hiDiTi∗+αIkDi(Ti∗-M)=∑i∈NTCiTi∗,the inequality holds whenΔi<0,TN∗<Ti∗and whenΔi⩾0,TN∗-M<0⩽Ti∗-M.IfΔN⩾0, thenΔi⩾0. We haveTCNTN∗=∑i∈N(hi+αIk)DiTN∗-∑i∈NαIkDiM⩽∑i∈N(hi+αIk)DiTi∗-∑i∈NαIkDiM=∑i∈NTCiTi∗,the inequality holds forTN∗<Ti∗.□From this theorem, it can be concluded that it is beneficial for retailers to cooperate and the cost saving achieves most when the grand coalition is formed.In this section, we introduce the inventory game with permissible delay in payments corresponding to the cooperative situation described in the above section. It follows from Theorem 3.1 that the common optimal solution exists for the coalition members when they cooperate, and cost savings can be fully realized through full cooperation. However, one natural question arises as how these savings should be allocated among the retailers in the cooperation. This question is addressed in a cooperative game theory framework in this section.We denote the inventory game with permissible delay in payments by a pair(N,cd), whereN={1,2,…,n}is the grand coalition containing all the retailers, andcdis the characteristic function on the family of subsets of N withcd(∅)=0. For any givenS⊆N,cd(S)is defined as the minimal total cost that the members in S can achieve when they cooperate. Following from Theorem 3.1, we have for eachS⊆N,cd(S)=c′(S)-a(S), wherec′(S)=2K+∑i∈SDiM2(αIk-piIe)·∑i∈S(hi+αIk)Di,ifΔS⩾02K·∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di,ifΔS<0anda(S)=∑i∈SαIkDiM,ifΔS⩾0∑i∈SpiIeDiM,ifΔS<0If delay in payments is not permitted, i.e.,Ie=Ik=0, then the inventory game with permissible delay in payments is reduced to the inventory game defined in Meca et al. (2004).In this section, we present a cost allocation rule for the inventory game with permissible delay in payments. For anyi∈N, the cost allocated to retailer i is defined asβi(cd)=ϕi(c′)-φi(a), whereϕi(c′)=(hi+αIk)Di∑j∈N(hj+αIk)Djc′(N),φi(a)=αIkDiM,ifΔN⩾0,ϕi(c′)=(hi+piIe)Di∑j∈N(hj+pjIe)Djc′(N),φi(a)=piIeDiM,ifΔN<0.The cost allocation ruleβis composed of two parts. One part divides the total costc′(N)proportionally, and the other divides the total costa(N). The following theorem shows that this cost allocation rule belongs to the core.Theorem 4.4The cost allocation ruleβbelongs to the core of(N,cd)and can be reached through a PMAS.1.WhenΔN<0,TN∗<M. It is easy to verify that∑i∈Nβi(cd)=2K·∑i∈N(hi+piIe)Di-∑i∈NpiIeDiM=cd(N).For anyS⊂N, ifΔS<0, then∑i∈Sβi(cd)=∑i∈S2K(hi+piIe)Di2K·∑j∈N(hj+pjIe)Dj-∑i∈SpiIeDiM⩽∑i∈S2K(hi+piIe)Di2K·∑j∈S(hj+pjIe)Dj-∑i∈SpiIeDiM=2K·∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di-∑i∈SpiIeDiM=cd(S).IfΔS⩾0, thenTS∗⩾M, hence∑i∈Sβi(cd)=∑i∈S(hi+piIe)TN∗-∑i∈SpiIeDiM=∑i∈ShiTN∗-∑i∈SpiIeDi(M-TN∗)⩽∑i∈ShiTS∗+∑i∈SαIkDi(TN∗-M)=cd(S).WhenΔN⩾0,ΔS⩾0for anyS⊂N. It is easy to verify that∑i∈Nβi(cd)=(2K+∑i∈N(αIk-piIe)DiM2)·∑i∈N(hi+αIk)Di-∑i∈NαIkDiM=cd(N),and∑i∈Sβi(cd)=∑i∈S(hi+αDi)TN∗-∑i∈SαIkDiM⩽∑i∈S(hi+αDi)TS∗-∑i∈SαIkDiM=cd(S).Moreover, the core allocation(β1,…,βn)can be reached through a PMAS (population monotonic allocation scheme). DefineyiS=ϕiS(c′)-φiS(a)for alli∈S, andS≠∅, whereϕiS(c′)=(hi+αIk)Di∑j∈S(hj+αIk)Djc′(S),φiS(a)=αIkDiM,ifΔS⩾0,ϕiS(c′)=(hi+piIe)Di∑j∈S(hj+pjIe)Djc′(S),φiS(a)=piIeDiM,ifΔS<0.Then for allS⊂N, andS≠∅, ifΔS<0,∑i∈SyiS=∑i∈S(hi+αIk)Di∑j∈S(hj+αIk)Djc′(S)-∑i∈SαIkDiM=c(S);ifΔS⩾0,∑i∈SyiS=∑i∈S(hi+piIe)Di∑j∈S(hj+pjIe)Djc′(S)-∑i∈SpiIeDiM=c(S).For allS⊂R⊂N, ifΔS<0, thenΔR<0,M⩾TS∗⩾TR∗, and for alli∈S,yiS=(hi+piIe)DiTS∗-piIeDiM⩾(hi+piIe)DiTR∗-piIeDiM=yiR.IfΔS⩾0, whenΔR<0,TS∗⩾M>TR∗, and for alli∈S,yiS=hiDiTS∗+αIkDi(TS∗-M)⩾hiDiTR∗-piIeDi(M-TR∗)=yiR;whenΔR⩾0,TS∗⩾TR∗⩾M, and for alli∈S,yiS=(hi+αIk)DiTS∗-αIkDiM⩾(hi+αIk)DiTR∗-αIkDiM=yiR.Finally,yiN=βi(c)for alli∈N. Therefore, the core allocationβcan be reached through a PMAS.□From Theorem 4.4, we can conclude that the core of the inventory game with permissible delay in payments is non-empty and this class of game is totally balanced. Total balancedness also implies that the inventory game with permissible delay in payments is subadditive, that is, cooperation can bring benefits. The existence of core means that there exist allocations which can guarantee the stability of grand coalition.The concept of core is one way to describe stability of the grand coalition. According to the definition of the core, no player has incentive to deviate from the grand coalition under a core allocation. However, one possible criticism for core is its myopia; that is, it assumes that players do not consider possible reactions of other players when they commit to a certain course of action. To address this problem, Chwe (1994) introduced the concept of largest consistent set (LCS), which analyzes coalition stability from a farsighted perspective. In this section, we will adopt the concept of LCS to analyze stability from a farsighted view. Similar application of LCS can be seen in Sošić (2006), Nagarajan and Sošić (2007, 2009) and Kemahlıoğlu-Ziya and Bartholdi (2011). The following theorem states that under the core allocation rule β, the grand coalition is also farsighted stable.Theorem 4.5The grand coalition is a farsighted stable outcome under the core allocation ruleβ.To prove that the grand coalition is a farsighted stable outcome, it is equivalent to show that any deviation from the grand coalition will eventually return to the grand coalition, that is, any possible deviation from the grand coalition is deterred. Suppose that the grand coalition is the status quo. To represent the coalition structures, we adopt the notation in Kemahlıoğlu-Ziya and Bartholdi (2011). We denote the grand coalition by{(1,…,n)}. Let{(1,…,k),(k+1,…,n)}and{1,2,…,n}denote the cases where k retailers form a coalition while the remainingn-kretailers form the other coalition and no coalitions are formed, respectively. If k retailers deviate from the grand coalition, the resulting coalition structure is{(1,…,k),(k+1,…,n)}. First of all, we show that the deviation of k retailers is deterred by the following sequence:{(1,…,n)}→C{(1,…,k),(k+1,…,n)}→C1{1,(2,…,k),(k+1,…,n)}→C2,…,→Cn{1,2,…,n}→Cn+1{(1,…,n)},whereC={1,2,…,k},C1={1},…,Cn={n},Cn+1={1,2,…,n}. LetZ1={(1,…,k),(k+1,…,n)},Z2={1,(2,…,k),(k+1,…,n)},…,Zn+1={1,2,…,n},Zn+2=Z=B={(1,…,n)}. Since the core allocation ruleβcan be reached through pmas, we haveZ1≺C1B,Z2≺C2B,…,Zn+1≺Cn+1B. According to the definition of farsighted stability,Z1≪BandZ1⊀CB. Therefore, a deviation by(1,…,k)is deterred. Other deviation can be analyzed in a similar approach. Hence, according to the definition of consistent sets, we can conclude that the grand coalition belongs to the largest consistent set, which implies that the grand coalition is a farsighted stable outcome.□Our result shows that under the core allocation ruleβthe grand coalition is in the LCS, that is, the grand coalition is also farsighted stable. Therefore, from Theorems 4.4 and 4.5, we can conclude that the grand coalition is stable both from a myopic and farsighted point of view.

In this paper we study the inventory problem with permissible delay in payments. This problem is relevant to the situation where retailers selling the same commodities place joint orders to the same supplier who allows retailers’ delay in payments. On the one hand, retailers seek to cooperate to place joint orders in order to save cost. On the other hand, suppliers allow permissible delay in payments in order to promote sales. However, coalition stability among retailers and designing fair cost allocations under permissible delay in payments is an unaddressed problem in the literature. To address this problem, we first study the joint ordering problem with permissible delay in payments, and decide the optimal common order cycle for retailers in the coalition so that the total cost is minimized. Then, we construct the class of inventory games with permissible delay in payments to analyze coalition stability of retailers. The results show that the formation of grand coalition is socially beneficial. To guarantee the stability of grand coalition, an allocation rule in the core is proposed to allocate cost among retailers. However, the concept of core has the weakness of treating coalition stability from a myopic perspective. To overcome this problem, we apply the concept of largest consistent set (LCS) to analyze the coalition stability from a farsighted view, and show that the grand coalition belongs to the LCS under the core allocation rule. These results show that grand coalition is a stable coalition from both a myopic and a farsighted point of view.Although cooperation among retailers has potential to bring savings to its members in the long-run, in practice certain factors exist for viability of a successful cooperation. The unwillingness of retailers to reveal their private information, for example, their demand rate, should be considered to design the fair cost allocation rule. Also competition between retailers should be taken into account to analyze coalition stability of retailers. Finally, the possible discount that the supplier might offer should also be included in the analysis of joint ordering. Future work aims to address these issues.
