Diets laden with salt and refined sugar have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and hypertension. However, few studies have investigated the impact of such diets on reproductive functions, hence, the present study. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (100–120 g, n = 24) were randomly divided into four groups designated control (standard chow), sucrose (30% w/v as drinking water), salt (8% salt diet) and sucrose + salt (30% w/v as drinking water + 8% salt diet). After 6 weeks, rats were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Sperm function was assessed post mortem. Blood sample was drawn via the retro-orbital sinus for estimation of serum levels of corticosterone, testosterone, LH and FSH using ELISA kit and electrolytes using flame photometer. Oxidative analyses of testes homogenate were carried out using previously described methods. Values are means ± SEM, compared by ANOVA. Sperm concentration, motility, viability and morphology were significantly altered in sucrose, salt, and sucrose + salt fed rats. In addition, the serum level of testosterone was significantly reduced in the treated rats compared with control. Sucrose, salt and sucrose + salt feeding resulted in increased level of serum corticosterone when compared with control. MDA level was significantly increased in salt and sucrose + salt fed rats compared with control and sucrose fed rats. Meanwhile, the activity of SOD was significantly increased in the treated rats compared with control. These data indicate that consumption of high sucrose and high salt diet either together or in isolation impact negatively on sperm function and may be underpinning the increasing prevalence of male infertility.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In recent times, diets are laden with salt and sugar [1] and constitute ‘the term’ Western diet [2]. The present day dietary pattern closely parallels the technological innovation that has penetrated the global food system, which has increased food availability and accessibility [3].Processed foods alone account for 80% of daily salt intake [4] apart from daily salt addition to cooking as well as those from natural sources such as meat and plant matter. It could therefore be inferred that daily high salt intake occurs frequently and individuals are often unaware of the amount of salt consumed. The recent estimate on human consumption of salt per day is about 8–12 g [5,6] and this amount is higher than the recommended daily intake of 1.5–2.0 g of salt [7]. In the same vein, soft drinks and sugar-sweetened beverages are a leading source of added sugar in the world [8,9]. Before the advent of modern agriculture, less than 2% energy was derived from sugar, but today about 18%–25% energy comes from simple sugars [6].The contemporary dietary habit of processed food consumption has become a risk factor in the development of metabolic syndrome [10–12]. Precisely, a high sucrose and/or high salt diet has been associated with increasing prevalence of obesity, hypertension, stroke and type 2 diabetes [5,13,14]. Interestingly, the growing report of infertility closely aligns the increasing incidence of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, which are fueled by changes in dietary pattern and behavior [15]. Furthermore, recent experimental studies have provided evidences that reproductive potential may be altered by the modern-day dietary habit. For instance, consumption of diet with high levels of sugar and saturated fats disrupt testicular metabolism and compromises spermatogenic processes in rats [16,17]. Similarly, testicular mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress was reported in rats fed a high energy diet, which consequently resulted in sperm defects [18]. In addition, a recent study has revealed that consumption of high fructose and/high salt diet exerted a profound effect on pregnancy outcome and fertility in female rats [6]. We have also reported that consumption of a high sucrose solution alters sperm motility and concentration in rats [19].Given that dietary habit exerts a profound influence on reproductive function [20], there is however lack of data on the comparative and synergetic effect of high sucrose and high salt diet on testicular physiology vis-a-vis sperm parameters and reproductive hormone profile. The present study was therefore designed to investigate the impact of a high sucrose and/or salt diet on reproductive function in male Sprague–Dawley rats. Food intake, body weight, fasting blood glucose, serum electrolyte and corticosterone levels, oxidative stress parameters, reproductive hormone profile and sperm function were evaluated in the experimental rats.A total of 24 male Sprague–Dawley rats (8 weeks old) weighing 100–120 g were used for this study. This rat strain was used because several studies have demonstrated its suitability to mirror diet-induced diseases in human [21,22]. The animals were kept in the laboratory animal facility of Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo, Nigeria. Rats were housed in transparent cages under constant environmental conditions (temperature; 24 ± 2 °C, relative humidity; 55–65% and illumination; 12-h light–dark cycle). The animals had ad libitum access to commercial rodent pellet diet (Livestock Feed, Lagos, Nigeria). Care was taken to ensure that all animal handlings and experimental protocols complied with the internationally accepted guideline for laboratory animal use and care (NIH publication No. 85-23, revised 1985).Rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups comprising of six animals each and designated as control; fed standard chow and tap water, sucrose; fed standard chow and 30% w/v sucrose solution as drinking water, salt; fed 8% NaCl diet and sucrose + salt; fed 30% w/v sucrose solution and 8% NaCl diet. The high sucrose solution (30% w/v) was prepared every second day and this was in accordance with the method of Riberio et al. [23]. The 8% NaCl diet was prepared as described by Iranloye et al. [24]. The standard chow had 0.3% NaCl, thus, 7.7% salt was added to the feed in a w/w ratio to make up for 8% NaCl diet. All rats were fed the experimental diet and sucrose solution ad libitum for a period of 6 weeks. Since it has been identified that processed food consumption may be a risk factor in the development of diabetes and hypertension [25,26], we used a 30% sucrose solution and 8% NaCl dietary regimen, which has been well validated to induce diabetes and hypertension, respectively, in experimental rats [22,23] to test our hypothesis on reproductive parameters. Food intake was recorded daily at 0800 hrs and body weight was determined once a week using a digital weighing scale (Scout Pro, Ohaus Corporation, USA). At the end of the treatment, all rats were euthanized by cervical dislocation following an overnight fast. Blood was collected via the retro-orbital sinus [27] into plain bottles, allowed to clot and centrifuge at 8000 g for 10 mins to obtain serum for hormonal assays and electrolyte determination. Sperm function was assessed post mortem. The reproductive organ – testes, caudal epididymis, seminal vesicle, and prostate gland – were dissected out, blotted dry and weighed. The testes were subsequently processed for oxidative studies.At the end of the 6th week of treatment, animals were fasted overnight and the tail vein was pricked with a sterilized needle to obtain blood for measurement of glucose levels using a blood glucose monitoring system (Accu-Chek Glucometer, Roche, Germany). The electrolytes were analyzed on Beckman Coulter DXC auto analyzer.Serum level of corticosterone, testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were determined using enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) and according to the manufacturer's instruction. The ELISA kits were manufactured by Diagnostics Automation Inc., Calabasas, California (USA).Oxidative analysis of the testes homogenate was done using previously described methods. Malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid peroxidation was estimated by the method of Uchiyama and Mihara [28] as thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS). To 1 ml of testes homogenate, 2 ml of thiobabarturic acid (TBA) reagent was added. The TBA reagent consists of 0.375% w/v TBA in 0.25 N HCL mixed with 15% w/v trichoroacetic acid (TCA) in deionized water in equal proportion. The mixture was vortexed and heated in a water bath at 100 °C for 15 minutes and then centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm against an appropriate blank. The concentration of TBARS was calculated from the extinction coefficient of 1.56 × 105M−1 cm−1.The reduced glutathione (GSH) content of the testes homogenate was determined using the method described by Van Dooran et al. [29]. Two milliliters of testes homogenate was deproteinized by the addition of 3 ml of a reagent consisting of 120 g NaC1, 6.68 g (HPO3)n (metaphosphoric acid) and 0.8 g ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) dissolved in 400 ml distilled water. After centrifugation at 40,000 g for 20 min, 0.5 ml of the supernatant obtained was added to 2 ml 0.3 M Na2HPO4•2H20 solution, followed by the addition of 2 ml of a dithio-bisnitrobenzoate (DNTB) solution (0.4 mg/ml 1% sodium citrate). The absorbance at 412 nm was measured immediately after mixing.Catalase (CAT) activity was determined by measuring the exponential disappearance of H2O2[30]. The enzyme reaction was started by adding 0.1 ml of testes homogenate to 2.9 ml of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 containing 12 mM H2O2. The absorbance was recorded at 240 nm immediately at 15 s interval until 2 minutes. A blank was also taken without sample.The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was determined by the method of Sun and Zigman [31]. The reaction was carried out in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 10.3 and was initiated by the addition of 3 × 10−4 M epinephrine in 0.005 N HCl. Absorbance was read at 480 nm. For all measurements, the absorbance was recorded using Shimadzu recording spectrophotometer (UV 160).The testes from each rat were carefully excised and removed along with its adjoining epididymis. One of the testes was separated from the epididymis and the caudal epipidymal tissue was removed and placed in a Petri dish containing 1 mL normal saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. An incision of about 1 mm was made in the caudal epididymis so as to liberate its spermatozoa into the saline solution. Progressive sperm motility, sperm count and sperm viability were then examined under the microscope using ×40 objective as previously described by Raji et al. [32]. Epididymal sperm motility was determined by calculating motile spermatozoa per unit area and was expressed as percent motility. Epididymal sperm counts were evaluated using the improved Neubauer hemocytometer and were expressed as million/ml of suspension. The sperm viability was also determined using eosin/nigrosin stain. The motile (live) sperm cells were unstained while the non-motile (dead) sperms absorbed the stain. The stained and unstained sperm cells were counted and an average value for each was recorded from which percentage viability was calculated. Sperm morphology was evaluated by staining the sperm smears on microscope slides with two drops of Walls and Ewa stain after they were air-dried. The slides were examined under the microscope under oil immersion with ×100 objectives. The abnormal sperms were characterized based on the presence of double tails, detached heads, detached tails, mid piece bending and irregular heads. The relative proportions of normal and abnormal sperm were expressed in terms of percentages.Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Comparison was made by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman–Keuls post-hoc test to determine the specific pairs of groups that were statistically different. P < 0.05 was accepted as significant. All analyses were done using the GraphPad Instat Version 3.05 for Window Vista, GraphPad Software, San Diego California, USA.
