@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Tagging is nowadays the most prevalent and practical way to make images searchable. However, in reality many manually-assigned tags are irrelevant to image content and hence are not reliable for applications. A lot of recent efforts have been conducted to refine image tags. In this paper, we propose to do tag refinement from the angle of topic modeling and present a novel graphical model, regularized latent Dirichlet allocation (rLDA). In the proposed approach, tag similarity and tag relevance are jointly estimated in an iterative manner, so that they can benefit from each other, and the multi-wise relationships among tags are explored. Moreover, both the statistics of tags and visual affinities of images in the corpus are explored to help topic modeling. We also analyze the superiority of our approach from the deep structure perspective. The experiments on tag ranking and image retrieval demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The community-contributed multimedia content in the internet, such as Flickr, Picasa, Youtube and so on, has been exploding. To facilitate the organization of the uploaded images or videos, media repositories usually offer a tool to enable consumers to manually assign tags (a.k.a. labels) to describe the media content [1]. These assigned tags are adopted to index the images to help consumers access shared media content.Reliable tagging results in making shared media more easily accessible to the public. However, the reliability of tagging is not guaranteed in that the tags may be noisy, orderless and incomplete [17], possibly due to carelessness of the taggers. First, some tags are noises and may be irrelevant to media. According to the statistics in Flickr, there are about only 50% tags indeed relevant to photos [17,10]. Second, different tags essentially have different relevance degrees to the media, but such information is not indicated in the current tag list, where the order is given according to the input sequence. We did an analysis on the MSRA-TAG dataset [24], which was crawled from Flickr, about what percentage of images have the most important tags in different positions. A statistics figure is shown in Fig. 1to indicate the result. It can be observed from this statistics that less than 20% images have the most relevant tags at the top position, which shows that the tags are almost in a random order in terms of the relevance. Last, the tags of some photos are incomplete due to the interest limitation of taggers, and even not given.We address the problem of refining the tags, to facilitate the access of the shared media. To be specific, we investigate the tagging problem in Flickr, one of the most popular photo sharing web sites, and propose to reorder the tags. The available information to refine the tags consists of manual tags and image affinity.1.Although they are not completely reliable, the manual tags still reflect the photo content in some degree and their relations can be explored for tag refinement. Existing solutions only make use of the pairwise relation between tags, mined from WordNet [31], or estimated from Web photo tags [21,22,24,37].Visually similar images usually tend to have similar semantics and hence have similar tags, which means that the tag refinement of one image may benefit from those of other images. The typical exploration [24,22] is to utilize the visual popularity of one image among the images having the same tag as a cue to estimate the relevance of the tag with this image.In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic formulation, to estimate the relevance of a tag by considering all the other images and their tags. To this goal, we propose a novel model called regularized latent Dirichlet allocation (rLDA), which estimates the latent topics for each document, with making use of other documents. The model is applicable in tag refinement due to the observation that the content of an image essentially contains a few topics and the reasonable assumption that the tags assigned to the image accordingly form a few groups. The latent topics are estimated by viewing the tags of each image as a document, and the estimation also benefits from other visually similar images by the regularization term, instead of the estimation by LDA only from the corresponding document. The main contribution of our approach lies in the following aspects. On the one hand, both LDA and rLDA explore the multiple-wise relation among tags through the latent topics, rather than pairwise relations in the random walk based methods. On the other hand, the tag relevance estimation from rLDA can be interpreted using the deep structure [3,13]. Compared with random walk and LDA, our approach is the deepest, and the illustration is presented in Fig. 2.
