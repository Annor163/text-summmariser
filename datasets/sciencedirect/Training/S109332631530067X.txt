@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Humic substances are ubiquitous in the environment and have manifold functions. While their composition is well known, information on the chemical structure and three-dimensional conformation is scarce. Here we describe the Vienna Soil-Organic-Matter Modeler, which is an online tool to generate condensed phase computer models of humic substances (http://somm.boku.ac.at). Many different models can be created that reflect the diversity in composition and conformations of the constituting molecules. To exemplify the modeler, 18 different models are generated based on two experimentally determined compositions, to explicitly study the effect of varying e.g. the amount of water molecules in the models or the pH. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the models, which were subsequently analyzed in terms of structure, interactions and dynamics, linking macroscopic observables to the microscopic composition of the systems. We are convinced that this new tool opens the way for a wide range of in silico studies on soil organic matter.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Soil Organic Matter (SOM) is a key part in the composition of soils and sediments, playing a significant role in adsorption and distribution of plant nutriments, pesticides, and pollutants, and in organic carbon stabilization [1]. However, the SOM composition varies spatially, due to geological and climatic conditions as well as plant cover and is heavily dependent on the utilization of the soil and the age of the soil layer [2–4]. Agriculture [5–8], and especially cover crop [9,10] has a significant effect on the quantity and quality of the SOM. Humic substances (HS) are the dominant constituents in SOM [11,12]. They are structurally very diverse, flexible molecules possessing multiple reactive sites and are crucial for numerous biogeochemical processes [13]. HS have been studied extensively regarding environmental, biochemical and therapeutic properties [14–22], and may also have an impact on atmospheric chemistry through the carbon cycle [11]. Challenges in the extraction and analysis complicate experimental molecular characterizations of HS [3,4]. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy are frequently used to characterize and quantify HS in soil samples [23–26]. As complete experimental data on the chemical and three-dimensional structures of HS are lacking, molecular modeling is an important potential source of such information [27]. Little molecular modeling has been performed on these substances, mostly because of their seemingly random composition [28,29]. However, it has been suggested that HS are formed during a controlled biological degradation of a limited number of compounds or abiotic reactions of biological degradation products [20,30]. The current consensus is that HS are supramolecular structures composed of relatively small molecules with similar characteristics and varying intermolecular interactions [31–33]. Some model compounds have been proposed [13,30,34–37], attempting to represent the HS ensemble by a single average structure. More flexible approaches to simulate humic molecules, taylored to experimental data, were not described so far.Two automated building tools have previously been described: The SIGNATURE program [38] and a self-assembly algorithm for single, branched 3D molecules based on a fragment database [39]. Both approaches have in common that a single representative structure is to be created, with which computational studies can be conducted. So far, HS were mostly studied in vacuum simulations, or with very few water molecules attached [13,27,35,40–42]. Furthermore, quantum mechanical studies have been performed on proposed models representing typical functional groups or fragments of HS [35,43–46].Here, we demonstrate the use of the GROMOS force field, optimized for condensed phase use, for molecular dynamics simulations of SOM. We have created an online tool, which uses a building-block database and assembles condensed-phase models representative of compositional data from experimental analyses of HS samples. Depending on the amount of available experimental data on the chemical composition, the modeler can aim to reproduce only the fraction of carbon vs. nitrogen in the models, or it can reproduce the experimentally determined abundances of various functional groups [3,47,48]. Condensed-phase systems are more representative of the aggregation state of HS than vacuum models [13]. The created model contains a user-defined number of HS molecules, water, and ions. The assembly of the selected building blocks is performed randomly; thus a multitude of systems can be created, which are all representative of the same experimental data. The initial building blocks were created based on previously proposed models [13,35,37] and additional building blocks can be readily added to the database. The generated models can subsequently be used to study e.g. thermodynamic properties at a molecular level in a multitude of ways.
