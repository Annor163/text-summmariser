@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Epilepsy is a brain disorder that affects about 1% of the population in the world. Seizure detection is an important component in both the diagnosis of epilepsy and seizure control. In this work a patient non-specific strategy for seizure detection based on Stationary Wavelet Transform of EEG signals is developed. A new set of features is proposed based on an average process. The seizure detection consisted in finding the EEG segments with seizures and their onset and offset points. The proposed offline method was tested in scalp EEG records of 24–48h of duration of 18 epileptic patients. The method reached mean values of specificity of 99.9%, sensitivity of 87.5% and a false positive rate per hour of 0.9.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Epilepsy is a brain disorder that affects about 1% of the world population and is characterized by intermittent abnormal firing of neurons in the brain, which may lead to recurrent and spontaneous seizures. Approximately 30% of the epileptic population is not helped by medications [1]. An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain [2,3].Electroencephalography (EEG) is the standard technique to record electrical brain activity in patients with neuro-pathologies. When epileptic activity begins, synchronized and abnormal electrical activity in a small area of the brain is observed [4]. Consequently, this process is reflected in the EEG record as a seizure. The seizure detection is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy and for the seizures control, especially for those patients with refractory (intractable) epilepsy.On one hand, this detection basically involves visual scanning of long electroencephalographic EEG recordings by the expert physicians in clinical practice. This procedure is done to identify and classify the seizure activity present in the EEG signal. Usually, the records are multichannel ones, lasting 24 to 72h, so their inspection implies a very time-consuming task.Fig. 1 shows 30s of a multichannel EEG record, a 14s seizure (marked by an expert) is indicated with red lines.On the other hand, an automatic seizure detection system can considerably reduce the volume of data to be observed by the physicians. Thus they could focus their attention on those parts of the EEG records having seizures. Consequently a more precise, swifter diagnosis can be made.Onset seizure detection is a useful tool for treatments such as timely drug delivery, electrical stimulation and seizure alert systems. Numerous processing techniques have been proposed for automatic seizure detection, quantification and recognition [5]. Some researchers used chaotic features (such as entropies) to evaluate the degree of disorder present in the epileptic signal [6]. Others proposed features from time–frequency domain [7]. Another technique used is the multi-way analysis, which is based on feature tensors to identify seizures [8]. Wavelet Transform (WT) has been widely used in the epilepsy detection [9,10]. In recent years the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique has been implemented for epileptic seizure detection as well [11,12]. In Mohammad et al. [13] the EMD and other different transformation techniques like discrete cosine transformation, discrete wavelet transformation and singular value decomposition are used in the analysis of epileptic EEG signals. Zhu et al. [14] proposed a fast weighted horizontal visibility graph constructing an algorithm to identify seizures from EEG signals. A comprehensive review of the majority of the techniques applied to epileptic seizure detection on EEG signals can be accessed in [15].Long EEG records are visually analyzed by the specialists searching for seizures. This task takes several hours. The aim of this study is to automatically detect epileptic seizures in long EEG records, in order to reduce the visual inspection time and additionally, to achieve an accurate diagnosis. For this purpose an offline seizure detection strategy based on new energy features extracted from Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) is developed. The onset and offset points of the seizures are also determined. The strategy proposes a pediatric patient non-specific method introducing a spatial average of features.In this work the CHB-MIT scalp EEG database was used, which is available free at http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/chbmit/[16]. This database, collected at the Children׳s Hospital Boston, is composed of EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with intractable seizures. Recordings were collected from 22 subjects (5 males, ages 3–22; and 17 females, ages 1.5–19), grouped into 23 cases (case 21 belongs to case 1 1.5 years later). Each case contains between 9 and 42 continuous files from a single subject. In most cases, the files contain one hour of digitized EEG signals, several files with seizures contain more than one seizure. All signals were sampled at 256Hz with 16-bit resolution. Most files contain 23 EEG channels. The international 10–20 system of EEG electrode positions and nomenclature was used for these recordings. In the current study the cases with the same bipolar configuration were used, corresponding to 18 patients. The details of the analyzed EEG records are shown inTable 1.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper presents an automatic algorithm that is able to detect epileptic seizures in long-term EEG records for clinical applications. The off line method is based on spectral and energy features extracted from the SWT of pediatric EEG signals. The current study proposed a spatial average of features which, on one hand, enables reducing the number of variables in the analysis. Conversely, it could allow the identification of seizures from different parts of the brain.The detection strategy is able to discriminate EEG signals with and without seizures reaching high values of SEN and SPE. Its implementation is simple and swift because it does not require training for every new patient. Before its clinical application, the detector could be tested on another EEG database to continue evaluating its performance.None declared.
