@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Simplified fuzzy ARTMAP (SFAM) is used in numerous classification problems due to its high discriminant power and low training time. However, the performance of SFAM is affected by the presentation order of the training patterns. The genetic algorithm (GA) can be considered as a solution to the problem because the selection of the training pattern order is a complicated combinatorial problem in a large search space. In this paper, a new genetic ordering method for SFAM is proposed to improve the performance of the algorithm. Special genetic operators are employed in the genetic evolution. Compared to the conventional methods, the proposed SFAM demonstrates better classification performance since it can efficiently deliver the desirable properties of parents to their offspring. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we perform experiments on various databases from the UCI repository.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Simplified fuzzy ARTMAP (SFAM) [1] is a supervised learning algorithm with many advantages over similar algorithms. SFAM has a reduced training time compared to those of other neural network architectures such as Multilayer Perceptron [2], and it can also learn new training data without revisiting old data. Furthermore, SFAM uses only a small number of parameters and does not require initial weight values. Thus, much research has been reported about the application of SFAM to numerous classification applications [1–6].However, the performance of SFAM is affected by the presentation order of the training patterns, and many studies have focused on this problem [2,3,7]. In [2], SFAM is trained several times, and then the predicted classes of the patterns are stored. Majority voting is used to determine the final class prediction for the patterns. However, this majority voting method requires many simulations. To solve this problem, the max–min ordering method was proposed [3]. For a c-class problem, max–min ordering chooses the first input pattern corresponding to the cluster center of the training input. After choosing the first input pattern, c training input patterns that are farthest from the cluster center in the training feature space are identified, and then the rest of the closet-neighbor patterns are ordered [3].To obtain higher performance, Planiappan et al. [7] introduced a new ordering method for SFAM which employed the genetic algorithm (GA) [8] to determine the presentation order of the training patterns. The GA can be considered as a good solution to the problem since the selection of the presentation order of the training patterns is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem in a large search space.The method seeks a presentation order of the training patterns such that the SFAM classification performance is improved as much as possible using selection, swap mutation and the inversion operator in the GA. Compared with random ordering [2] and max–min ordering [3], the GA has a shorter training time, smaller SFAM size and better performance. Effected by [7], several researches about ARTMAP optimization using GA have been reported. M. Yaghini et al. find optimized training pattern order of fuzzy ARTMAP using GA [9]. C. Loo et al. applied GA to biased ARTMAP to find an optimized biasing parameter and training sequence [10]. C. Loo et al. proposed an optimized fuzzy ARTMAP ensembles using hierarchical fair-competition parallel GA (HFCPGA) to optimize not only training sequence but also ARTMAP parameters and feature selection [11].However, Planiappan et al. [7] did not fully exploit the characteristics of the GA in that the important features of the parent chromosomes are not delivered to the offspring, thereby degrading performance.In the present paper, a new genetic method for the presentation ordering of training patterns is presented. The input pattern ordering is formulated into a combinatorial optimization problem, and special genetic operators are employed to facilitate the training in this formulation. Unlike the previous method [7], the desirable features of the parent chromosomes are effectively delivered to their offspring.This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, background concerning SFAM and GA is discussed. In Section 3, a new genetic ordering scheme for SFAM is proposed. In Section 4, experiments on the proposed scheme are performed, and the results and discussion are presented. Conclusions are offered in Section 5.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we present a new method for selecting the presentation order of training data in SFAM. We employ not only swap mutation and the inversion operator, but also crossover operators, such as cyclic crossover and partially matched crossover, to efficiently impart important features of the parent chromosome to the offspring. The performance of the proposed method is compared to those of the previous methods using various datasets selected from the UCI repository. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous classification methods. In this work, we have employed simple GA (SGA). In the future, we would like to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm with hierarchical fair-competition parallel GA (HFCPGA) [11] and symbiotic evolutionary strategy (SES) [18]. We expect the proposed method to perform well for HFCPGA and SES because our method is applicable to SGA, HFCPGA and SES.
