@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Association mining is a well explored topic applied to various fields. In this article, the associations among the genes have been identified from microarray gene expression data. Here a methodology, called Fuzzy Correlated Association Mining (FCAM), is developed for identifying the associations among the genes that have altered quite significantly from normal state to diseased state with respect to their expression patterns. This idea leads to predict the disease mediating genes along with their altered associations. The proposed methodology involves generation of fuzzy gene sets, construction of fuzzy items, computation of fuzzy support for fuzzy items and fuzzy correlation coefficient of a pair of fuzzy items, generation of associations, and identification of altered associations from normal to diseased state. The concept of finding fuzzy correlation between two groups of items, generation of altered associations among the items (groups of items) and then rank these items (groups of items) according to their importance are the novel contribution of the present article. The effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated on five gene expression data sets dealing with human lung cancer, colon cancer, sarcoma, breast cancer and leukemia. As a result, some possible genes, like IGFBP3, ERBB2, TP53, HBB, KRAS, PTEN, CALCA, CDKN2A, has been found as important genes that may mediate the development of various cancers considered here. For comparison, we have considered 11 existing association rule mining algorithms. The results are appropriately validated in terms of gene–gene interactions, functional enrichment, biochemical pathways, and using NCBI database.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Exploratory data mining techniques are needed that can, roughly speaking, be considered as the search for interesting bi-sets, i.e., sets of biological situations and sets of genes, which are associated in some way. Indeed, it is interesting to look for groups of co-regulated genes, for which a reasonable assumption is that they participate in a common function within the cell [1]. Genes are grouped together according to similar expression profiles. The association among a set of co-regulated genes and its discovery pave a way to a better understanding of gene regulation.Fuzzy set theory is capable of handling uncertainty in the gene expression values arising due to incompleteness, imprecision, noise and experimental errors. Moreover, genes have expression values that are in different intervals under two conditions (i.e., normal or diseased). Although each interval has a well-defined boundary, they are highly overlapped. Fuzzy set theory is especially suitable to model such imprecise and overlapping data. Thus incorporation of the notion of fuzzy sets in the methods enables one to handle such overlapping intervals in a better way [2,3].The notion of fuzzy sets has been used in the domain of gene expression analysis. They include, among others, development of rule discovery procedure [4] based on knowledge extraction of gene by classification; transformation of gene expression by fuzzy heuristic rule set [5]; classifying fuzzy inference system [6]; development of a fuzzy model for gene regulatory networks [7]; measuring performance of small rule-based classifiers using fuzzy logic [8]; identification of normal and tumor patients using a fuzzy neural network model [9].Global gene expression profiling, both at the transcript level and at the protein level, can be a valuable tool in the understanding of genes, biological networks and cellular states. As larger and larger gene expression data sets become available, data mining techniques can be applied to identify patterns of interest in the data. Association rules, used widely in the area of market basket analysis, can be applied to the analysis of expression data as well. Association rules can reveal biologically relevant associations between different genes or between environmental effects and gene expression [10]. Items in gene expression data can include genes that are highly expressed or repressed, as well as relevant facts describing the cellular environment of the genes (e.g., the diagnosis of a tumor sample from which a profile was obtained).Association rule discovery has been applied to gene expression data, searching for patterns of differential expression across tens of thousands of genes. In life threatening diseases, such as cancer, where the effective diagnosis includes annotation, early detection, distinction, and prediction, data mining and statistical approaches offer the promise for precise, accurate, and functionally robust analysis of gene expression data [11]. The computational extraction of derived patterns from microarray gene expression is a non-trivial task that involves sophisticated algorithm design and analysis for specific domain discovery. In an earlier investigation, a model was proposed for feature extraction by first applying feature selection heuristics based on the statistical impurity measures like Gini Index, Max Minority, and the Twoing Rule and obtaining the top 100–400 genes and then analyze the associative dependencies between the genes and assign weights to the genes based on their degree of participation in the rules [12]. An analysis of some of these rules reveals numerous associations among certain genes, many of which make sense biologically, others suggesting new hypotheses that may warrant further investigations.In this article, an association rule-mining algorithm, called fuzzy correlated association mining (FCAM), has been developed, which uses gene expression data to generate the association among the large set of genes and more importantly to identify the set of altered associations. The algorithm considers a large set of genes and determines the disease mediating genes (marker genes) (Fig. 1).Unlike the proposed algorithm FCAM, there is no method that determines gene–gene associations that have altered from normal state to diseased one and thereby finding possible disease mediating genes. Thus, identifying the associations among the genes, discovering the altered associations from gene expression data and finally the proposal of gene ranking technique that is used to identify the importance of the genes from the set of altered associations may be considered as a novel concept. Biological data are often imprecise and noisy. Moreover, in microarray gene expression data, genes have expression values that are in different intervals under two conditions, i.e., normal or diseased. Although each interval has a well-defined boundary, they are highly overlapped. Fuzzy set theory is especially suitable to model such imprecise and overlapping data. This idea leads us to develop the methodology using the concept of fuzzy set theory. Thus incorporation of the notion of fuzzy sets in the proposed method enables one to handle such overlapping intervals in a better way.We have applied the proposed methodology (FCAM) (Fig. 1) on gene expression data sets of 5 different human cancers (lung, colon, lymphocyte, sarcoma and breast). There exist several methods for finding gene–gene associations. These existing methods may be classified into 3 categories, viz., Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3. The methods under Category 1 consider finding gene–gene associations from structural data, i.e., sequence data [13–15]. Under Category 2, the methods determine associations among gene functions and protein–protein interactions by using gene expression data as well as some other databases [16–20]. The methods, under Category 3, determine association among objects in a non-biological domain [21–26]. Since we could not find any method that works exactly the same way as FCAM does, we have considered 11 methods under Categories 2 and 3 for comparison. Although it can extract the associations among the genes from microarray gene expression data, we can put FCAM under Category 2.The superior performance of FCAM has been demonstrated in terms of gene–gene interactions, functional enrichment, biochemical pathways and based on some earlier information available in NCBI database. Moreover, F-score statistics has been used to validate the result (for details about F-score, one may see Appendix B).Section 2 mainly deals with different existing methods of gene–gene interactions and its related investigations. Section 3 is the methodology, i.e., the description of FCAM (Fig. 1) consists of several subsections like Mathematical Preliminaries (Section 3.1), Algorithm for generation of associations (Section 3.2), Altered set of associations from normal to diseased state (Section 3.4) and Ranking of genes based on their importance (Section 3.5). Section 5 provides the result which consists of several subsections, namely, Description of Datasets (Section 5.1), Analysis of the results (Section 5.2) and Comparisons (Section 5.3). The comparison is done using gene–gene interactions, biochemical pathways, database and functional enrichment. In addition, some possible reasons behind superior performance of FCAM have been explained in Section 5.3. Finally, the paper concludes in Section 6. Further, the proofs of three lemmas, definition of F-score, and some more tables and figures are provided in Appendix.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this article, we have developed a methodology, called fuzzy correlated association mining (FCAM) that has identified associations among the genes and found out the disease mediating genes from gene expression data. The algorithm has identified the associations among the genes, which have altered quite significantly from normal state to diseased state. Moreover, a gene ranking measurement has been formulated to identify the importance of the genes that are present in the set of altered associations.The effectiveness of FCAM, along with superior performance over 11 existing methods has been demonstrated on five gene expression datasets (lung, colon, sarcoma, leukemia and breast). The comparative study has been made in terms of gene–gene interactions, biochemical pathways, using NCBI database and functionally enriched attributes. We have found genes, like IGFBP3, ERBB2, TP53, HBB, KRAS, PTEN, CALCA, CDKN2A as some possible important genes mediating certain cancers considered in this article. It has been found that FCAM has been able to find more true positives than the existing methods considered here. We have also validated the altered associations among the genes using various pathways available in NCBI database. As a consequence, we can say that these sets of identified genes along their altered associations, have a significant role of mediating the various types of cancers.Lemma 1The number of elements in Trin rth iteration is |Tr|=∑i=r2r−1ni, r≥1, n≥2r−1.ProofWe now prove Lemma 1 by the method of induction. In general, if there is a set D={g1, g2, …, gn−1, gn} consisting of n genes then T1={(g1), (g2), …, (gn−1), (gn)} and|T1|=n1=∑i=121−1ni. Similarly, the set T2 consists of 2-terms. The number of 2-terms isn2. Thus,|T2|=n2=∑i=222−1ni. The set T3 consists of both 3-terms and 4-terms. The number of 3-terms isn3and that of 4-terms isn4. Thus,|T3|=n3+n4=∑i=323−1ni. Similarly, the set T4 consists of 4-terms, 5-terms, 6-terms, 7-terms, 8-terms. Thus,|T4|=n4+n5+n6+n7+n8=∑i=424−1ni. Therefore, the Lemma 1 is valid for r=1, 2, 3 and 4. Let us assume that the lemma is valid for r=r. That is, |Tr|=∑i=r2r−1ni. Now the set Tr+1 consists of (r+1)-terms, (r+2)-terms, …, 2×2r−1 i.e., 2rterms. Therefore,|Tr+1|=nr+1+nr+2+⋯+n2r=∑i=r+12r+1−1ni. Thus, if Lemma 1 is valid for r=1 then it is valid for r=2. If Lemma 1 is true for r=2, it holds for r=3, and so on. Thus, |Tr|=∑i=r2r−1ni, r≥1, n≥2r−1.Lemma 2The maximum number of iterations of FCAM is ⌈1+log2n⌉.ProofFrom Lemma 1, we can get n≥2(r−1), where r is the number of iterations. Thus, for the maximum value of r=R, 2R−1=n. That is, R=1+log2n. If n is not a power of 2 then R=⌈1+log2n⌉.Lemma 3The number of associations in candidate set Crin rth iteration is|Cr|=∑i=r2r−1(2i−1−1)ni, r≥1, n≥2r−1.ProofThe number of associations generated from each r-term isr(r−1)+r(r−2)+…+r1/2, i.e., (2r−1−1) where r≥1. Thus, the number of associations generated from all r-terms becomes(2r−1−1)nr. Similarly, number of associations generated from all (r+1)-terms is(2r−1)n(r+1). In this way, we can get(2(2r−1−1)−1)n2r−1associations generated by all 2r−1-terms. All these associations are included in the set Cr. Therefore, total number of associations in Cr, r≥1, in rth iteration is|Cr|=(2r−1−1)nr+(2r−1)n(r+1)⋯+(2(2r−1−1)−1)n2r−1=∑i=r2r−1(2i−1−1)niIt is to be noted that Lris generated from Crin rth iteration based on fuzzy support and fuzzy correlation coefficient using corresponding threshold values.F-score (∈[0, 1]) [52] is defined as(10)F-score=(β2+1)*Precision*Sensitivityβ2*Precision+Sensitivitywhere(11)Sensitivity=tp(tp+fn)(12)Precision=tp(tp+fp)The terms tp, fp, fn and β stand for true positive, false positive, false negative and balance factor, respectively. All the above three measures distinguish the correct classification of labels within different classes. They concentrate on one class (positive examples). Sensitivity or Recall is a function of its correctly classified examples (true positives) and its misclassified examples (false negatives). Precision is a function of true positives and examples misclassified as positives (false positives). The F-score [52] is evenly balanced when β=1. It favors precision when β>1, and sensitivity or recall otherwise. In our experiment, we have chosen β=1.See Appendix Figs. C.3–C.13and Tables C.5–C.7.
