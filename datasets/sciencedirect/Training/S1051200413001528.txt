@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In order to improve the detection performance of constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors in multiple targets situations, a CFAR detector based on the maximal reference cell (MRC) named MRC-CFAR is proposed. In MRC-CFAR, a comparison threshold is generated by multiplying the amplitude of MRC by a scaling factor. The number of the reference cells left, whose amplitudes are smaller than the comparison threshold, is counted and compared with a threshold integer. Based on the comparison result, proper reference cells are selected for detection threshold computation. A closed-form analysis for MRC-CFAR in both homogeneous and non-homogeneous environments is presented. The performance of MRC-CFAR is evaluated and compared with other CFAR detectors. MRC-CFAR exhibits a very low CFAR loss in a homogeneous environment and performs robustly during clutter power transitions. In multiple targets situations, MRC-CFAR achieves a much better detection performance than switching CFAR (S-CFAR) and order-statistic CFAR (OS-CFAR). Experiment results from an X-band linear frequency modulated continuous wave radar system are given to demonstrate the efficiency of MRC-CFAR. Because ranking reference cells is not required for MRC-CFAR, the computation load of MRC-CFAR is low; it is easy to implement the detector in radar system in practice.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors perform target detection by comparing the radar return in the test cell to an adaptive detection threshold [1]. The detection threshold is usually determined by estimating the background noise/clutter power in the test cell and multiplying this estimation by a constant scaling factor based on the desired probability of false alarm [2,3]. In modern radar systems, the background noise/clutter power is estimated from the reference cells which are adjacent to the test cell and constitute a reference window.Two groups of CFAR detectors have been widely applied. They are mean-level based CFAR detectors (ML-CFAR) and rank ordering based CFAR detectors. The group of ML-CFAR detectors includes cell-averaging CFAR (CA-CFAR) and its variations, such as the greatest-of CFAR (GO-CFAR) and the smallest-of CFAR (SO-CFAR) [4,5]. CA-CFAR adaptively sets the detection threshold by using the mean level of reference cells in the reference window. When the background noise/clutter power is unknown, CA-CFAR is the optimal CFAR detector in a homogeneous Gaussian environment if the reference cells are statistically independent and identically distributed. However, when the length of the reference window grows, non-homogeneous environments are often encountered, such as multiple targets situations or clutter edge environments [6,7]. The presence of multiple targets results in raised detection thresholds and the masking of weak targets near strong targets. A clutter edge results in low-than-desired detection thresholds and excessive false alarm rates [8–10]. CA-CFAR suffers from performance degradation in non-homogeneous environments. GO-CFAR and SO-CFAR are the modifications of CA-CFAR. In GO-CFAR and SO-CFAR, the reference window is divided into the leading and lagging reference windows. The detection threshold of GO-CFAR is computed by using the maximum of sums in the leading and lagging windows. GO-CFAR exhibits a robust false alarm control capacity at clutter edges, but suffers from a poor detection performance in multiple targets situations. The background noise/clutter power of SO-CFAR is estimated by the minimum of sums in the leading and lagging windows. SO-CFAR gives a high detection performance when interferers appear in either the leading or the lagging windows, but suffers from excessive false alarm rates at clutter edges [6].The group of rank ordering based CFAR detectors includes the censored mean-level detector (CMLD-CFAR), the order-statistic CFAR (OS-CFAR), and the trimmed-mean CFAR (TM-CFAR). The detection threshold of CMLD-CFAR is computed by the mean level of the r smallest ranked reference cells. CMLD-CFAR is robust in multiple targets situations, as long as the number of censored cells exceeds the number of interfering targets [11,12]. The background noise/clutter power of OS-CFAR is estimated by the kth ordered reference cell. OS-CFAR is more robust than CMLD-CFAR in a multiple targets situation, but suffers from excessive false alarms at clutter edges [13]. TM-CFAR is a generalization of OS-CFAR and CMLD-CFAR. For TM-CFAR, thek1smallest andk2largest ranked reference cells are censored first, and the mean level of reference cells left are used to compute the detection threshold [14]. The rank-ordering CFAR detectors have a better detection performance than the ML-CFAR detectors in multiple targets situations, but suffer from excessive false alarm rates during clutter power transitions [6].In order to adapt to various non-homogeneous environments, CFAR detectors combined of the above different CFAR algorithms have been proposed. Depending on the outcomes of the variability index (VI) and mean ratio (MR) hypothesis tests, the variability index CFAR (VI-CFAR) dynamically switches its detection threshold to that of CA-CFAR, GO-CFAR or SO-CFAR [15]. VI-CFAR performs robustly in both homogeneous and non-homogeneous environments, but its detection performance degrades when interferers appear in both the leading and lagging windows. A modification of VI-CFAR named automatic censored cell averaging CFAR (ACCA-CFAR) is proposed in [16]. Based on the statistic named ordered data variability (ODV), ACCA-CFAR dynamically rejects the interfering cells in the reference window by successive hypothesis tests. ACCA-CFAR acts like CA-CFAR in a homogeneous environment and performs robustly in multiple targets situations, but suffers from excessive false alarm rates at clutter edges. A combination of SO-CFAR, GO-CFAR, censored OS-CFAR and geometric-mean CFAR (GM-CFAR) to form an ensemble of robust technique is discussed in [17]. A knowledge-based CFAR (KB-CFAR) detector, which uses prior information provided by a geographic information system (GIS) to choose reference cells for detection threshold computation, is proposed in [10].In order to alleviate the drastic degradation of mean-level CFAR detectors in multiple targets situations, the excision CFAR (E-CFAR) proposed in [18] excises strong reference cells which exceed a predetermined thresholdBE, the surviving reference cells are averaged to compute the detection threshold. Compared with CA-CFAR, E-CFAR suffers almost no degradation in performance, when it operates in a homogeneous environment. The automatic censored mean-level detector (ACMLD-CFAR) automatically censors the interfering targets by introducing a cell-by-cell criterion for rejecting reference samples. ACMLD-CFAR does not require a prior knowledge about the background environment of reference window, and achieves a robust detection performance in a multiple targets situation [8].Based on the magnitude of test cell, the switching CFAR (S-CFAR) detector selects different reference cells to compute the detection threshold [19,20]. S-CFAR exhibits a good performance in both homogeneous and multiple targets situations, but suffers from excessive false alarm rates at clutter edges. A modification of S-CFAR named SOS CFAR I, which combines ordering statistics and a switching scheme, is proposed in [21].In order to improve the detection performance in multiple targets situations, a CFAR detector based on the maximal reference cell (MRC) named MRC-CFAR is proposed in this paper. In MRC-CFAR, a comparison threshold is generated by multiplying the amplitude of MRC by a scaling factor. Then the number of the reference cells left, whose amplitudes are smaller than the comparison threshold, is counted and compared with a threshold integer. Based on the comparison result, proper reference cells are selected to compute the detection threshold. MRC-CFAR exhibits a very low CFAR loss in a homogeneous environment and performs robustly during clutter power transitions. In a multiple targets situation, the detection performance of MRC-CFAR is much better than that of OS-CFAR and S-CFAR.This paper is organized as follows. The detection threshold generation algorithm of MRC-CFAR is given in Section 2. A closed-form analysis for MRC-CFAR is given in Section 3. A four-step procedure of selecting the parameters for MRC-CFAR is detailed in Section 4. A demonstration of parameter selection via a case study, and a performance evaluation of MRC-CFAR are given in Section 5. The performance of MRC-CFAR conditioned onNI, which denotes the maximum number of interfering targets that the detector can tolerate, is elaborated in Section 6. In Section 7, the efficiency of MRC-CFAR is demonstrated by experiment results from a linear frequency modulated continuous wave (LFMCW) radar system.The block diagram of MRC-CFAR is shown in Fig. 1. In-phase and quadrature (I and Q) signals are the samples of range/Doppler returns from the matched filter in radar receiver. The samples are square-law detected and then a sequential set ofN+1detector outputs is stored in a tapped delay line. The centered cell in the tapped delay line is the test cell; the N cells left are reference cells and form a reference window.Assume that I and Q signals are independent, identically distributed (iid), zero mean, Gaussian random processes in a homogeneous environment. The target return fluctuates according to the Swerling I model. So the amplitude of each cell in the tapped delay line is an iid random variable with an exponential probability density function (pdf) described by(1)f(x)=1λe−x/λ,x⩾0If the cell contains noise only, it hasλ=λN, whereλNis the noise power; if the cell is in a clutter region with a clutter-to-noise ratio (CNR) ofσC, it hasλ=λN(1+σC); if the test cell contains a target return with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of σ, it hasλ=λN(1+σ); if the reference cell contains an interfering target return with an interference-to-noise ratio (INR) ofσI, it hasλ=λN(1+σI).In Fig. 1,xTis the test cell,x1,x2,…,xNare the reference cells. Letx(N)denote the MRC,x(N)is selected from the reference cells as follows(2)x(N)=maxn∈[1,N](xn)TheN−1reference cells left are denoted asx(1),x(2),…,x(N−1). For analysis simplification, letx(1)⩽x(2)⩽⋯⩽x(N−1). A comparison thresholdγx(N)is generated by multiplyingx(N)by γ, where γ is a scaling factor with0<γ⩽1. TheN−1reference cells left are partitioned into setsS0andS1as follows(3)x(n)<γx(N)⇒x(n)∈S0,x(n)⩾γx(N)⇒x(n)∈S1,1⩽n⩽N−1After theN−1reference cells have been compared withγx(N), letn0denote the number of cells sorted toS0. It has0⩽n0⩽N−1, and(4)x(n0)<γx(N)⩽x(n0+1),0⩽n0⩽N−1,x(0)=0Let DT denote the detection threshold of MRC-CFAR, DT is computed as follows(5)DT={T0N∑k=1Nxk,n0<NTT1n0∑xk∈S0xk,n0⩾NTwhereNTis a threshold integer with0<NT<N,T0andT1are threshold factors withT0>0andT1>0. A target is declared in the test cell if(6)xT>DTBased on the comparison result betweenn0andNT, MRC-CFAR dynamically selects the reference cells inS0or all reference cells to compute DT. When no more thanN−NTinterfering targets appear in the reference window, there is a high probability thatx(N)is an interfering target return and noise cells are sorted toS0. So there is a high probability ofn0⩾NT. In order to improve the detection performance, the cells inS0are selected to compute DT. When the reference window is in a homogeneous environment, the amplitude ofx(N)is small. The reference cells left are sorted toS1with a high probability. So there is a high probability ofn0<NT. In order to keep a low false alarm rate, all of the reference cells are used to compute DT.Assume that the reference window contains M (1⩽M⩽N−1) interfering targets with the same INR ofσI. The M interfering target returns are denoted asxi(1),xi(2),…,xi(M). TheN−Mreference cells left are noise samples and denoted asxn(1),xn(2),…,xn(N−M). For analysis simplification, setxi(1)⩽xi(2)⩽⋯⩽xi(M)andxn(1)⩽xn(2)⩽⋯⩽xn(N−M). According to [22], the joint pdf of the M interferers andN−Mnoise samples is(7)fXI(1),XI(2),…,XI(M),XN(1),XN(2),…,XN(N−M)(xi(1),xi(2),…,xi(M),xn(1),xn(2),…,xn(N−M))=M!(N−M)!∏i=1MfI(xi(i))∏j=1N−MfN(xn(j)),0⩽xi(1)⩽xi(2)⩽⋯⩽xi(M),0⩽xn(1)⩽xn(2)⩽⋯⩽xn(N−M)where(8)fI(x)=1λN(1+σI)e−x/λN(1+σI),x⩾0(9)fN(x)=1λNe−x/λN,x⩾0Asn0varying from 0 toN−1are mutually exclusive events, thePdof MRC-CFAR in the multiple targets situation is(10)P(N,NT,γ,T0,T1,σ,σI,M)=∑n0=0NT−1Pn0+∑n0=NTN−1Qn0wherePn0is thePdwhen there aren0reference cells inS0andn0<NT,Qn0is thePdwhen there aren0reference cells inS0andn0⩾NT.Whenn0<NT, DT is determined by all of the reference cells, let(11)vN=∑n=1Nx(n)=∑n=1Mxi(n)+∑n=1N−Mxn(n),vN⩾0Whenn0<NT, DT can be written as(12)DT=T0NvN,n0<NTBecausex(N)=max(xi(M),xn(N−M)),Pn0can be written as(13)Pn0=∑m=M0,IM1,IPm,n0,xi(M)⩾xn(N−M)+∑m=M0,NM1,NPm,n0,xi(M)<xn(N−M)where(14)M0,I=max(0,n0−N+M)(15)M1,I=min(M−1,n0)(16)M0,N=max(0,n0−N+M+1)(17)M1,N=min(M,n0)M0,IandM1,Idenote the possibly smallest and largest numbers of interferers sorted toS0whenxi(M)⩾xn(N−M), respectively.Pm,n0,xi(M)⩾xn(N−M)is thePdwhen there are m interferers andn0−mnoise samples inS0on condition thatn0<NTandxi(M)⩾xn(N−M).M0,NandM1,Ndenote the possibly smallest and largest numbers of interferers sorted toS0whenxi(M)<xn(N−M), respectively.Pm,n0,xi(M)<xn(N−M)is thePdwhen there are m interferers andn0−mnoise samples inS0on condition thatn0<NTandxi(M)<xn(N−M).

MRC-CFAR should have a robust performance in both homogeneous and non-homogeneous environments. To keep the design procedure simple, consider the caseT0=T1=T. The parameter design procedure of MRC-CFAR is divided into four steps.Step 1: Suppose that MRC-CFAR is required to tolerate up toNIinterfering targets within its reference window, the threshold integer is set toNT=N−NI.Step 2: For each value ofγ∈[0.01,1], the corresponding T, which sets MRC-CFAR at the desired probability of false alarm (PD,f), is computed by using (30).Step 3: For each set of(γ,T)obtained in Step 2, using (30) withσ=100, thePdfor a 20 dB target in a homogeneous environment is computed; using (29) withσI=σ=100,M=NI, thePdfor a 20 dB target in the severest multiple targets situation is computed.Step 4: One best set of(γ,T)is finally identified from the results obtained in Step 3 according to the trade-off between the detection reduction in a homogeneous environment and the detection improvement in the severest multiple targets situation. With the best set of(γ,T), MRC-CFAR should exhibit a robust detection performance in the severest multiple targets situation, and suffer from a very low CFAR loss in a homogeneous environment.In this section, the MRC-CFAR design procedure is demonstrated via a case study. Then the performance of MRC-CFAR in various environments is evaluated and compared with that of other CFAR detectors.Assume that the size of reference window isN=24, thePD,fis set at1×10−6. Suppose that MRC-CFAR is expected to tolerate up to eight interfering targets in its reference window. Parameters of MRC-CFAR are designed as follows.Step 1: Because MRC-CFAR is required to tolerate up to eight (NI=8) interfering targets, the threshold integer is set toNT=N−NI=16.Step 2: For each value ofγ∈[0.01,1], using (30) withN=24,NT=16,σ=0, the corresponding T which sets thePfof MRC-CFAR in a homogeneous environment at1×10−6is computed. The(γ,T)results are given in Table 1.Step 3: For each set of(γ,T)in Table 1, using (30) withN=24,NT=16,σ=100, thePdfor a 20 dB target in a homogeneous environment is computed; using (29) withN=24,NT=16,σI=σ=100,M=8, thePdfor a 20 dB target in the severest multiple targets situation is computed. The two detection curves are shown in Fig. 2.Step 4: In Fig. 2, the simulation results to the two detection curves in Step 3 are given by Monte Carlo method, the number of Monte Carlo simulations for each point in the two curves is 106. The curves computed by using (30) and (29) coincide precisely with that of simulation results. So the correctness of the derivation results is verified. On the curve ofM=8, as γ increases from 0.01 to 0.04, thePdincreases considerably from 33.47% to 78.60%; as γ increases from 0.05 to 1, thePddecreases considerably from 76.83% to 2.06%. On the curve of homogeneous environment, thePdatγ=0.04is 83.04%, which reduces slightly compared with the maximum of 83.17% (atγ=0.01). Therebyγ=0.04is selected as it gives a reasonable trade-off between the homogeneous detection loss and worst-case detection improvement. The parameter set for MRC-CFAR atPD,f=1×10−6is[N,NT,γ,T0,T1]=[24,16,0.04,18.85,18.85].In this section, the performance of MRC-CFAR is evaluated and compared with that of CA-CFAR, GO-CFAR, SO-CFAR, OS-CFAR and S-CFAR. The parameter set obtained in Section 5.1 is used for MRC-CFAR performance evaluation. For OS-CFAR, the sixteenth ranked reference cell is used to compute the detection threshold. The value of parameter α in S-CFAR is set the same as that of γ in MRC-CFAR. The MRC-CFAR curves are computed by using (29) and (30), the S-CFAR curves are computed by using the closed-form expression in [19].Fig. 3shows the detection performance of CFAR detectors in a homogeneous environment. CA-CFAR is the optimal CFAR detector in a homogeneous environment. The detection performance of MRC-CFAR is almost the same as that of S-CFAR, and slightly lower than that of CA-CFAR. With respect to CA-CFAR, the performances of other detectors are ranked from high to low according to their CFAR losses atPd=50%as follows: MRC-CFAR, S-CFAR: 0.04 dB, GO-CFAR: 0.18 dB, OS-CFAR: 0.80 dB, SO-CFAR: 1.02 dB.In the presence of two (one in each half reference window) and four interfering targets withINR=SNR, the detection performance of CFAR detectors is given in Fig. 4. On the curves ofM=2, CA-CFAR, GO-CFAR and SO-CFAR suffer from poor detection performances. Although OS-CFAR and S-CFAR perform robustly, their detection performances are slightly lower than that of MRC-CFAR. On the curves ofM=4, thePdof MRC-CFAR is at least 10% higher than that of OS-CFAR and S-CFAR when SNR increases from 14 dB to 19 dB.In the presence of six interfering targets, the detection performance of CFAR detectors is shown in Fig. 5. On the curves of INR = SNR, thePdof MRC-CFAR is at least 10% higher than that of OS-CFAR and S-CFAR when SNR increases from 13 dB to 21 dB. Especially atSNR=17dB, thePdof MRC-CFAR is 20.07% higher than that of OS-CFAR. On the curves of MRC-CFAR, when INR-to-SNR ratio increases from one to five, the detection performance degrades if SNR is no less than 17 dB.Next the detection performance of MRC-CFAR at a clutter edge is examined. In the presence of six clutter cells, one and two interfering targets withSNR=CNR=INR, the detection performance of CFAR detectors is shown in Fig. 6. On the curves of one interferer (equivalent to seven interferers), thePdof MRC-CFAR is at least 10% higher than that of OS-CFAR and S-CFAR when SNR increases from 14 dB to 23 dB, especially atSNR=17dB, thePdof MRC-CFAR is 23.76% higher than that of OS-CFAR. On the curves of two interferers (equivalent to eight interferers), thePdof MRC-CFAR is at least 10% higher than that of OS-CFAR and S-CFAR when SNR increases from 14 dB to 24 dB, especially atSNR=18dB, thePdof MRC-CFAR is 28.18% higher than that of OS-CFAR.Fig. 7shows the false alarm performance of CFAR detectors at a clutter edge withCNR=20dB. For MRC-CFAR, when less thanNIreference cells are filled with clutter returns, the cells in S0 are selected to compute DT with a high probability, thereby thePfincreases compared withPD,f. When the test cell moves from noise region to clutter region, thePfexhibits a sharp discontinuity, the false alarm control capacity of MRC-CFAR is much better than that of SO-CFAR, and slightly inferior to that of OS-CFAR and S-CFAR.NIdenotes the maximum number of interfering targets that MRC-CFAR is designed to tolerate. In this section, the performance of MRC-CFAR conditioned onNIis examined. Assume thatN=24,PD,f=1×10−6andγ=0.04, the threshold factor T for eachNI∈[7,12]is computed by using (30), and given in Table 2.Fig. 8shows the detection performance of MRC-CFAR conditioned onNIin a homogeneous environment. When the value ofNIincreases, the probability of selectingS0to compute DT grows, as a result, the CFAR loss that MRC-CFAR suffers from grows. In Fig. 8, the detection performance of MRC-CFAR degrades whenNIincreases from seven to twelve.In the presence of nine interfering targets withINR=SNR, the detection performance of MRC-CFAR conditioned onNIis shown in Fig. 9. On the curves ofNI=7andNI=8, as the number of interferers exceeds the maximum that MRC-CFAR is designed to tolerate, the detection performances are poor. On the curves ofNI=9to 12, MRC-CFAR exhibits robust detection performances. Because a larger value ofNIresults in a higher CFAR loss, the detection performance degrades whenNIincreases from nine to twelve if SNR is higher than 17 dB.At a clutter edge withCNR=20dB, the false alarm performance of MRC-CFAR conditioned onNIis shown in Fig. 10. On the curves ofNI=7to 11, when a small amount of reference cells is in the clutter region, the cells inS0are selected to compute DT with a high probability, thereby thePfincreases slightly compared withPD,f. When the number of cells containing clutter is larger thanN/2, the test cell is in the clutter region. WhenNIincreases from seven to twelve, the probability of selectingS0to compute DT increases, as a result, the false alarm control capacity degrades.In this section, the efficiency of MRC-CFAR is verified by experiment data sampled from an X-band LFMCW radar system developed in our laboratory. For the LFMCW radar, in order to suppress static clutter and increase processing gain, fast Fourier transform (FFT), moving target indication (MTI) and moving target detection (MTD) are employed as the matched filter, where MTD is implemented by a 32 point FFT.The experiment scene is shown in Fig. 11(a). The corresponding range/Doppler cells, which are the results of sampled data processed by matched filter and square law detector, are shown in Fig. 11(b). Target 1, Target 2 and Target 4 are located in Doppler 4 channel and in the multiple targets situation. Target 3 is located in Doppler −3 channel and in a homogeneous environment. The detection results of MRC-CFAR, OS-CFAR and S-CFAR to each Doppler channel in Fig. 11(b) are shown in Fig. 11(c), where the parameter selection of each CFAR processor is the same as that in Section 5. Fig. 11(d) shows the detection thresholds in Doppler 4 channel computed by CFAR processors.As shown in Fig. 11(c), the three CFAR processors can all detect Target 1, Target 2, Target 3, and exhibit no false alarm dot. When detecting Target 4, MRC-CFAR partitions the interferers intoS1and selects the noise cells inS0to compute the detection threshold; thereby Target 4 is detected. As OS-CFAR suffers from a high CFAR loss in a multiple targets situation, although the sixteenth ranked reference cell is a noise sample, Target 4 cannot be detected by OS-CFAR. For S-CFAR, because the amplitude of Target 4 in the test cell is small, the reference window is determined in a homogeneous environment, all of the reference cells are selected to compute the detection threshold. As a result, Target 4 is masked by S-CFAR. In a multiple targets situation, the detection performance of MRC-CFAR is more robust than that of OS-CFAR and S-CFAR.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Based on the magnitude of MRC, MRC-CFAR dynamically selects the reference cells inS0or all reference cells to compute the detection threshold. A closed-form analysis for MRC-CFAR is given. A four-step procedure of selecting the parameter set for MRC-CFAR is detailed. MRC-CFAR exhibits a very low CFAR loss in a homogeneous environment, and performs robustly during clutter power transitions. In multiple targets situations, the detection performance of MRC-CFAR is much better than that of OS-CFAR and S-CFAR. When the maximum number of interfering targets that MRC-CFAR can tolerate grows, the detector suffers from a higher CFAR loss in a homogeneous environment, and a worse false alarm control capacity at clutter edges. Instead of ranking all of the reference cells, MRC-CFAR only needs to select the MRC to compute the comparison threshold. Then the number of reference cells left, whose amplitudes are smaller than the comparison threshold, is counted and compared with a threshold integer. Based on the comparison result, MRC-CFAR switches to use proper reference cells to compute the detection threshold. Compared with conventional rank-ordering CFAR processors, ranking reference cells is not required for MRC-CFAR, so the computation load of MRC-CFAR is low, and it is easy to implement the detector in radar systems in practice. In addition, applying the MRC-CFAR algorithm to compound-Gaussian environments is a worthwhile topic for future research.
