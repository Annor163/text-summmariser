We present a method for the landmark transfer on 3D meshes that are nearly isometric.One or more custom landmarks are placed by the user on a source mesh.Our method efficiently computes corresponding landmarks on a family of target meshes.For each landmark we construct a minimal graph that accurately locates the landmark.We adopt modified histograms of geodesic distance to consistently locate a landmark.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Landmarks play a central role in many algorithms, including correspondence computation, and shape analysis, which deal with highly relevant problems in shape retrieval. Consequently, a lot of attention has been paid to landmark extraction and matching problems during the past decade. While most existing landmark extraction methods use geometrical prominence as a main criterion of feature selection, landmarks can often be defined from the semantics that are specific to applications, independently from geometric saliency. This is particularly true for anthropometric studies [1] or computer animation [2]. Moreover, landmarks are often not persistent across pose changes or inter-subject variations.So far, when a user is interested in characterization and selection of points on a mesh without a strongly distinguishable geometric saliency, we have often relied on manual labeling. Manual labeling has also been almost the only trustworthy way when the objective is to obtain a persistent set of landmarks across a set of multiple meshes. Existing techniques on automatic landmark extraction [3,4] and matching may not work well in such cases, since the geometric features are not necessarily persistent across deformations; for instance, in case of non-rigid deformations.However, the work spent on manually labeling and associating landmarks is tedious and time consuming. Thus, in this work we aim at developing techniques to help with the reuse of the landmarks defined by the user, so that consistency can be assured with a minimal user input, regardless of geometric distinctiveness of the landmarks.Our landmark transfer technique allows the user to define one or more custom landmarks on a source mesh, and efficiently computes meaningful correspondences on a family of target meshes that are approximately isometric. We develop our method for uniquely describing any given point on the shape, which is not necessarily geometrically significant. A good advantage of our method in comparison with relevant/existing techniques is its fast computation time. This is possible because our method is optimally designed for transferring a sparse set of landmarks on multiple target models while avoiding unnecessary full registration.With the goal of optimal landmark transfer towards obtaining a consistent set of landmarks across multiple sets, we make several smaller contributions:(1)We develop the idea of the minimal graph (Section 5), which is used for landmark transfer with minimum computation.Identification of landmark points using a newly defined geodesic coordinates (Section 6.1): in contrast to previous approaches, we do not rely solely on geodesic distances. Instead we develop a reliable method of updating geodesic distances, which compensates well for distance changes due to imperfect isometry and assures precise and consistent landmark location.
