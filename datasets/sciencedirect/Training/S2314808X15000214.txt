In this article, the novel (G′/G)-expansion method is used to construct exact travelling wave solutions of the coupled nonlinear evolution equation. This technique is uncomplicated and simple to use, and gives more new general solutions than the other existing methods. Also, it is shown that the novel (G′/G)-expansion method, with the help of symbolic computation, provides a straightforward and vital mathematical tool for solving nonlinear evolution equations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The investigation of exact travelling wave solutions to nonlinear evolution equation plays an important role in the study of nonlinear physical phenomena for various fields of science and engineering, especially in mathematical physics, plasma physics, fluid dynamics, quantum field theory, biophysics, chemical kinematics, geochemistry, propagation of shallow water waves, high-energy physics and so on. The analytical solutions of such equations are of fundamental importance since a lot of mathematical-physical models are described by nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs). Many powerful and direct methods have been developed to find explicit solutions to the NLEEs, such as, wave of translation [1], the inverse scattering transform [2], the Hirota's bilinear method [3], the Darboux transformation method [4], the Backlund transformation method [5], the tanh method [6], the tanh-sech method [7], the symmetry method [8], the Painleve expansion method [9], the Exp-function method [10–14], the Adomian decomposition method [15], the homogeneous balance [16] and so on to construct exact solution of NLEEs. Lately, Wang et al. [17] introduced an expansion technique called the (G′/G)-expansion method, and they verified that it is a simple technique look for analytic solutions of NLEEs. In order to show the efficiency of the (G′/G)-expansion method and to extend the range of its applicability, further research has been carried out by several researchers, such as, Zhang et al. [18] proposed a generalization of the (G′/G)-expansion method for solving the evolution equations with variable coefficients. Zhang et al. [19] also presented an improved (G′/G)-expansion method to seek general traveling wave solutions. Zayed [20] obtainable a new approach of the (G′/G)-expansion method where G(ξ) satisfies the Jacobi elliptical equation[G′(ξ)]2=e2G4(ξ)+e1G2(ξ)+e0. Zayed [21] again proposed an alternative approach of this method in which G(ξ) satisfies the Riccati equation G′(ξ)=A+BG2(ξ), where A and B are arbitrary constants. Akbar et al. [22] proposed a generalized and improved (G′/G)-expansion method which give more new solutions than the improved (G′/G)-expansion method [19]. Recently, Alam et al. [23] further improved the (G′/G)-expansion method known as novel (G′/G)-expansion method. They have solved only single NLEEs using this method.The nonlinear Maccari system is an important mathematical model in physics. Currently, Lee et al. [24], Hafez et al. [25], and Manafian et al. [26,27] have solved the Maccari system using the Kudryashov method, theexp(−(Φ(ξ)))-expansion method and the Exp-function method respectively. Therefore, the aim of this article is to investigate new exact travelling wave solutions to the Maccari system by use of the novel (G′/G)-expansion method, which is more effective than others methods.Let us consider the nonlinear evolution equation(1)P(u,ut,ux,uy,uxx,uyy,utt,utx,…),where P is a polynomial in u(x,y,t) and its partial derivatives wherein the highest order partial derivatives and the nonlinear terms are concerned. The most important steps of the method are as follows:Step 1: Combine the real variables x,y and t by a complex variable ξ, we suppose thatStep 2: Assume the solution of Eq. (3) can be expressed in powers ψ(ξ):andΦ(ξ)=G′(ξ)G(ξ).Here α−Nor αNmay be zero, but both of them could not be zero simultaneously. αj(j=0, ±1, ±2, ⋯,±N) and d are constants to be determined later, and G=G(ξ) satisfies the second order nonlinear ODE:(6)GG″=λGG′+μG2+ν(G′)2where prime denotes the derivative with respect ξ; λ, μ, and ν are real parameters.The Cole-Hopf transformationΦ(ξ)=ln(G(ξ))ξ=G′(ξ)G(ξ)reduces the Eq. (6) into Riccati equation:(7)Φ′(ξ)=μ+λΦ(ξ)+(ν−1)Φ2(ξ)Eq. (7) has individual twenty five solutions (see Zhu [28] for details).Step 3: The value of the positive integer N can be determined by balancing the highest order linear terms with the nonlinear terms of the highest order come out in Eq. (3). If the degree of u(ξ) is D[u(ξ)]=n, then the degree of the other expressions will be as follows:Step 4: Substitute Eq. (4) including Eqs. (5) and (6) into Eq. (3), we obtain polynomials in(d+G′(ξ)G(ξ))jand(d+G′(ξ)G(ξ))−j, (j=0, 1, 2, ⋯,N). Collect each coefficient of the resulted polynomials to zero, yields an over-determined set of algebraic equations for αj(j=0, ±1, ±2, ⋯,±N), d and V.Step 5: Suppose the value of the constants can be obtained by solving the algebraic equations obtained in Step 4. Substituting the values of the constants together with the solutions of Eq. (6), we will obtain new and comprehensive exact traveling wave solutions of the nonlinear evolution Eq. (1).Discussion 1: It is noteworthy to examine that if we replace λ by −λ and μ by −μ and put ν=0 in Eq. (6), then the novel (G′/G)-expansion method coincide with Akbar et al.'s [19] generalized and improved (G′/G)-expansion method. If we put d=0 in Eq. (5) and ν=0 in Eq. (6), this method is identical to the improved (G′/G)-expansion method presented by Zhang et al. [19]. Again if we put d=0, ν=0 and negative the exponents of (G′/G) are zero in Eq. (4), then this method turn out into the basic(G′/G)-expansion method introduced by Wang et al. [17]. Finally, if we put ν=0 in Eq. (6) and αj(j=1, 2, 3,⋯,N) are functions of x, y and t instead of constants then the this method is transformed into the generalized the (G′/G)-expansion method developed by Zhang et al. [18]. Therefore we observe that the methods mentions in the refs. [17,19,22,29,30] are only special cases of the novel (G′/G)-expansion method.Let us consider the (2 + 1)-dimensional coupled integrable nonlinear system in the following form(8)iut+uxx+uv=0vt+vy+(|u|2)x=0}.If we apply the following transformation(9)u(x,y,t)=eiωU(ξ),v(x,y,t)=V(ξ),where ω=px+qy+rt and ξ=x+y+ct, the Maccari system in (8) can be reduced to a system of ODE form as follows:(10)U″−(r+p2)U+UV=0(c+1)V′+(U2)′=0}Integrating the second equation in (10) and neglecting the constant of integration we find(11)V=−1(c+1)U2Substituting (11) into the first equation of system in Eq. (10), we obtain(12)(c+1)U″−(c+1)(r−p2)U−U3=0,where primes denotes the differentiation with regard to ξ. Inserting (4) and (6) and considering the homogeneous balance between U″ and U3 in Eq. (12), we obtain 3N=N+2. i. e. N=1. Therefore, we have,(13)U(ξ)=α−1(ψ(ξ))−1+α0+α1(ψ(ξ)).Substituting Eq. (13) into Eq. (12), the left hand side is transformed into polynomials in(d+G′(ξ)G(ξ))j, (j=0, 1, 2, ⋯, N) and(d+G′(ξ)G(ξ))−j, (j=0, 1, 2, ⋯, N). Equating the coefficients of similar power of these polynomials to zero, we obtain a system of algebraic equations for α−1, α0, α1, d, p, q, r and c. Solving the obtaining system of algebraic equations by use of the symbolic computation software, such as Maple 13, we obtainSet 1:Set 2:Set 3:Set 4:Set 5:By substituting Eqs. 14–18 to the Eq. (13), we get(19)U1(ξ)=a−1{(d+(G′/G))−1−(2υd−λ−2d)2(μ−λd+νd2−d2)}(20)U2(ξ)=a−1(λ2(ν−1)+(G′/G))−1(21)U3(ξ)=α1{−(2νd−λ−2d)2(ν−1)+(d+(G′/G))}(22)U4(ξ)=α1{(4μν−λ2−4μ)4(ν−1)2(λ2(ν−1)+(G′/G))−1+(λ2(ν−1)+(G′/G))}(23)U5(ξ)=α1{−(4μν−λ2−4μ)4(ν−1)2(λ2(ν−1)+(G′/G))−1+(λ2(ν−1)+(G′/G))}Therefore, with the help of Eqs. (9), (11) and (19), the travelling wave solution of the Maccari system is given by(24)u1(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt)×{(d+(G′/G))−1−k}v1(ξ)=−a−12(c+1)×{(d+(G′/G))−1−k}2where,ξ=x+y−(−4μd2+2υ2d4−4υd4+2λ2d2+2μ2−4λd3ν+4μνd2+4λd3−4μλd+2d4−a−122(μ−λd+νd2−d2)2t,k=(2υd−λ−2d)2(μ−λd+νd2−d2),r=2μν−λ22+p2−2μand a−1,μ,ν,λ,d,p and q are arbitrary constants.By substituting the value of (G′/G) into Eq. (24), we obtain the following:when Ω=λ2−4μν+4μ>0 and λ(ν−1)≠0 (orμ(ν−1)≠0), we get that(25)u11(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−12(ν−1)(λ+Ωtanh(12Ωξ)))−1−k}v11(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−12(ν−1)(λ+Ωtanh(12Ωξ)))−1−k}2(26)u12(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−12(ν−1)(λ+Ωcoth(12Ωξ)))−1−k}v12(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−12(ν−1)(λ+Ωcoth(12Ωξ)))−1−k}2(27)u13(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−12(ν−1){λ+Ω(tanh(Ωξ)±isech(Ωξ))})−1−k}v13(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−12(ν−1){λ+Ω(tanh(Ωξ)±isech(Ωξ))})−1−k}2(28)u14(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−12(ν−1){λ+Ω(coth(Ωξ)±csch(Ωξ))})−1−k}v14(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−12(ν−1){λ+Ω(coth(Ωξ)±csch(Ωξ))})−1−k}2(29)u15(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−14(ν−1){2λ+Ω(tanh(14Ωξ)+coth(14Ωξ))})−1−k}v15(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−14(ν−1){2λ+Ω(tanh(14Ωξ)+coth(14Ωξ))})−1−k}2(30)u16(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+±Ω(A2+B2)−AΩcosh(Ωξ)Asinh(Ωξ)+B})−1−k}u16(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+±Ω(A2+B2)−AΩcosh(Ωξ)Asinh(Ωξ)+B})−1−k}2(31)u17(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+±Ω(A2+B2)+AΩcosh(Ωξ)Asinh(Ωξ)+B})−1−k}v17(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+±Ω(A2+B2)+AΩcosh(Ωξ)Asinh(Ωξ)+B})−1−k}2where, A and B are real non-zero constants.(32)u18(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+2μcosh(12Ωξ)Ωsinh(12Ωξ)−λcosh(12Ωξ))−1−k}v18(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+2μcosh(12Ωξ)Ωsinh(12Ωξ)−λcosh(12Ωξ))−1−k}2(33)u19(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+2μsinh(12Ωξ)Ωcosh(12Ωξ)−λsinh(12Ωξ))−1−k}v19(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+2μsinh(12Ωξ)Ωcosh(12Ωξ)−λsinh(12Ωξ))−1−k}2(34)u110(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+2μcosh(Ωξ)Ωsinh(Ωξ)−λcosh(Ωξ)±iΩ)−1−k}v110(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+2μcosh(Ωξ)Ωsinh(Ωξ)−λcosh(Ωξ)±iΩ)−1−k}2(35)u111(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+2μsinh(Ωξ)Ωcosh(Ωξ)−λsinh(Ωξ)±Ω)−1−k}v111(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+2μsinh(Ωξ)Ωcosh(Ωξ)−λsinh(Ωξ)±Ω)−1−k}2when Ω=λ2−4 μν+4 μ<0 and λ (ν−1)≠0 (orμ  (ν−1)≠0), we get that(36)u112(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+12(ν−1)(−λ+−Ωtan(12−Ωξ)))−1−k}v112(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+12(ν−1)(−λ+−Ωtan(12−Ωξ)))−1−k}2(37)u113(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−12(ν−1)(λ+−Ωcot(12−Ωξ)))−1−k}u113(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−12(ν−1)(λ+−Ωcot(12−Ωξ)))−1−k}2(38)u114(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+−Ω(tan(−Ωξ)±sec(−Ωξ))})−1−k}v114(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+−Ω(tan(−Ωξ)±sec(−Ωξ))})−1−k}2(39)u115(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−12(ν−1){λ+−Ω(cot(−Ωξ)±csc(−Ωξ))})−1−k}v115(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−12(ν−1){λ+−Ω(cot(−Ωξ)±csc(−Ωξ))})−1−k}2(40)u116(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+14(ν−1){−2λ+−Ω(tan(14−Ωξ)−cot(14−Ωξ))})−1−k}v116(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+14(ν−1){−2λ+−Ω(tan(14−Ωξ)−cot(14−Ωξ))})−1−k}2(41)u117(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+±−Ω(A2−B2)−A−Ωcos(−Ωξ)Asin(−Ωξ)+B})−1−k}v117(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+±−Ω(A2−B2)−A−Ωcos(−Ωξ)Asin(−Ωξ)+B})−1−k}2(42)u118(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+±−Ω(A2−B2)+A−Ωcos(−Ωξ)Asin(−Ωξ)+B})−1−k}v118(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+12(ν−1){−λ+±−Ω(A2−B2)+A−Ωcos(−Ωξ)Asin(−Ωξ)+B})−1−k}2where, A and B are constants such thatA2−B2>0.(43)u119(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−2μcos(−Ωξ/2)−Ωsin(−Ωξ/2)+λcos(−Ωξ/2))−1−k}v119(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−2μcos(−Ωξ/2)−Ωsin(−Ωξ/2)+λcos(−Ωξ/2))−1−k}2(44)u120(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+2μsin(−Ωξ/2)−Ωcos(−Ωξ/2)−λsin(−Ωξ/2))−1−k}v120(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+2μsin(−Ωξ/2)−Ωcos(−Ωξ/2)−λsin(−Ωξ/2))−1−k}2(45)u121(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−2μcos(−Ωξ)−Ωsin(−Ωξ)+λcos(−Ωξ)±−Ω)−1−k}v121(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−2μcos(−Ωξ)−Ωsin(−Ωξ)+λcos(−Ωξ)±−Ω)−1−k}2(46)u122(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d+2μsin(−Ωξ/2)−Ωcos(−Ωξ/2)−λsin(−Ωξ/2)±−Ω)−1−k}v122(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d+2μsin(−Ωξ/2)−Ωcos(−Ωξ/2)−λsin(−Ωξ/2)±−Ω)−1−k}2when μ=0 and λ (ν−1)≠0, we get that(47)u123(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−λk(ν−1){k+cosh(λξ)−sinh(λξ)})−1−k}v123(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−λk(ν−1){k+cosh(λξ)−sinh(λξ)})−1−k}2(48)u124(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−λ{cosh(λξ)+sinh(λξ)}(ν−1){k+cosh(λξ)+sinh(λξ)})−1−k}v124(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−λ{cosh(λξ)+sinh(λξ)}(ν−1){k+cosh(λξ)+sinh(λξ)})−1−k}2when (ν−1)≠0 and λ=μ=0, we get that(49)u125(ξ)=a−1ei(px+qy+rt){(d−1(ν−1)ξ+c1)−1−k}v125(ξ)=−a−12(c+1){(d−1(ν−1)ξ+c1)−1−k}2Again, by use of (20) and the solutions G(ξ) of Eq.

Solutionsu11,v11,u12,v12,u14,v14,u16,v16,u17,v17,u8,v18,u19,v19,u111,v111,v31,u412,v412,u512,v512,u523andv523of the Maccari system (8) are described the soliton. Solitons are special kinds of solitary waves. The soliton solution is a specially localized solution, hence u′(ξ),  u″(ξ),  u‴(ξ)→0 asξ→±∞. Solitons have a remarkable property-- it keeps its identity upon interacting with other solitons. Soliton solutions also give rise to particle-like structures, such as magnetic monopoles etc. Fig. 1presented the soliton obtained from solutionsu11,v11,u12andv12withp=−c/2, q=1, λ=1, μ=−1, d=1.5, ν=3, α−1=2 and −10≤x, t≤10, y=0 respectively.Solutions ofu21,v21,u212andv212represents the single soliton solution. In Fig. 2, we have presented the single soliton solutions ofu21andv21forp=−c/2, q=1, λ=1, μ=−1, ν=3, α−1=2 with −10≤x, t≤10, y=0 respectively.Solutionsu31,u41,v41u425,v425,u51,v51,u525andv525describes the multiple soliton solutions. In Fig. 3, we have presented the multiple soliton solutions ofu41,v41forp=−c/2, q=1, λ=1, μ=−1, ν=3, α1=1 with −10≤x, t≤10, y=0 respectively.Solutions ofu125,v125,u325,v325,u423andv423are Cuspon of the Maccari system (8). Cuspons are other forms of solitons where solution exhibits cusps at their crests. Unlike peakons where the derivatives at the peak differ only by a sign, the derivatives at the jump of a cuspon diverge. The statement is that cuspon can be represented asu(x,t)=e−|x−a|1/2,n>1. It can easily be shown thatuξ→∞at the cusp, anduξ,uξξ⋯→0to distinguish the soliton property. In Fig. 4, we presented the shape of the cuspon, obtain from solutionsu125andv125of the Maccari system (8) forλ=0, μ=0, ν=3, d=1, α−1=2, c1=0.5 with −10≤x, t≤10,y=0 respectively.Solutionsu123,v123,u124,v124,u323andv323are bell-shapesech2solitary traveling wave solution. The Fig. 5shows the shape of bell-shapedsech2solitary traveling wave solution (only shows the shape of solution ofu123andv123only for p=−c/2, p=1, k=5, λ=1, μ=0, ν=3, d=1, α−1=2 with −10≤x, t≤10, y=0.Singular kink solution is another kind of travelling wave solution which comes from infinity as in trigonometry. The solution ofu15,v15u223andv223comes infinity as in trigonometry, are singular kink solution. The Fig. 5 shows the shape of the exact singular kink-type solution (only shows the shape of solution ofu15,v15forp=−c/2, q=1, λ=1, μ=−1, ν=3, d=1.5, α−1=2 with −10≤x, t≤10,y=0 ).Solutions ofu312andv312represent the exact periodic traveling wave solutions. Periodic solutions are traveling wave solutions that are periodic such as cos(x−t). In Fig. 6, we have represented the periodic solution ofu312andv312for p=−c/2, q=1, λ=−1, μ=1, ν=2, d=1, α1=1 with −10≤x, t≤10.Solutions ofu112,v112tou122,v122are represented the exact soliton periodic traveling wave solutions of the Maccari system (8).
