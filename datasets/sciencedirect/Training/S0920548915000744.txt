@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which are comprised of a large number of low-cost, low-power, small size, and multifunctional sensor nodes with finite battery life that can sense and process data and communicate with each other over a short distance [1,2], have been a topic of much interest to researchers due to their wide-ranging applications. For example, they have been used in military field [3], environmental field [4], health field [5], and smart home-field [6], to name a few. In these operations, sensors are utilized for collecting information on entities of their interest, where, efficient routing protocol and data transmission are usually required [7]. In WSNs, as the traffic of the network converges to the sink, nodes close to the sink consume their energy faster than farther nodes because they have to undertake the heavy workload for data forwarding and data collection.Considering the packet delivery is restricted to the nodes around the sink and numerous packets will be accumulated in these nodes in a high data rate network, a solution to this problem is to deploy several sinks in a monitoring field, which poses a new challenge for routing protocol design. Currently, anycast becomes a very useful service for data transmission in multiple sinks. The paradigm of anycast communications [8,9], also termed one-to-any communications, is a newly designed communication service in IPv6, which is used to deliver a packet to any member of a group of designated recipients. Anycast technique plays an important role in the fields of DNS [10], etc. In WSNs, anycast technique can be used for neighbor and sink selection: when a sensor node produces data, it just needs to send it to any neighbor node or sink available.In WSNs with multiple sinks deployed, for reliability, load-balancing and security purpose, it is then useful to ensure that at least k sinks receive a message whatever the k sinks, which is generally called k-anycast communication [11]. k-Anycast is an extension of anycast which delivers the packets sent by clients to at least or at most k member of an anycast group identified by an anycast address. k-Anycast communication technique is utilized for enhancing transmission reliability, load-balancing, and security purpose by collecting multiple copies of a packet from a source and verifying the information of monitoring field. Even though k-anycast scheme provides a high data transmission quality, it is easy for sensor nodes to deplete their energy due to limited and fixed energy supplement [12,13]. Note, it is generally accepted that the usefulness of a wireless sensor expires when its battery runs out. Therefore, there are scare works considering k-anycast communication for WSNs owing to the limited lifetime of sensor nodes.Currently, an interesting approach to extend the lifetime of sensor nodes is to equip them with rechargeable technologies [14], which convert sources such as body heat [15], foot strike [16], finger strokes [17], and solar [18] into electricity. Assuming energy neutral operation [19], a sensor node can operate perpetually if the harvested energy is used at an appropriate rate. Note, a harvesting node is said to achieve energy-neutral operation if the energy used is always less than the energy harvested, and the desired performance level can be supported in a given harvesting environment. In these so called energy harvesting WSNs (EH-WSNs) or Rechargeable WSNs (R-WSNs), where sensors are equipped with rechargeable batteries or super-capacitor (in the order of a million recharge cycles [20]), although their lifetime is less of an issue, some new challenges appear due to the unique characteristics of R-WSNs.For one thing, owing to the unpresentable nature of the environment and technology limitations, the available energy on nodes varies dramatically over time [21], which causes nodes to control energy utilization continually according to available energy. For another thing, the power storage capacity is limited [22], which means a node cannot be always beneficial to conserve energy when a network can harvest excessive energy from the environment [23]. In other words, reducing the power consumption below energy neutrality will not increase the lifetime further, but decrease the efficiency of the node utilization [24]. Since more energy can be extracted from the ambient environment, the harvested energy should be consumed as soon as possible in R-WSNs [25,26]. Therefore, rich power of sensors attribute to the application of k-anycast communication in R-WSNs.In a nutshell, in the work, we propose a k-anycast routing protocol for data transmission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generic work that studies the routing protocol for k-anycast communication in R-WSNs. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present a number of existing routing protocols about anycast and k-anycast communication, while in Section 3 the motivation is provided. In Section 4 we present our method and design. Section 5 contains experimental results. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.
