@&#ABSTRACT@&#
For the detection of a weak known signal in additive white noise, a generalized correlation detector is considered. In the case of a large number of measurements, an asymptotic efficacy is analytically computed as a general measure of detection performance. The derivative of the efficacy with respect to the noise level is also analytically computed. Positivity of this derivative is the condition for enhancement of the detection performance by increasing the level of noise. The behavior of this derivative is analyzed in various important situations, especially showing when noise-enhanced detection is feasible and when it is not.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recently, the employment of noise in enhancing the performance of signal processors has emerged as a topic of significant interest [1–11]. This notion is rooted in the concept of stochastic resonance (SR) that was first elucidated in the area of climate dynamics [12]. The attraction of SR is that an appropriate non-zero noise level can improve, rather than degrade, the performance of nonlinear systems [13–19]. So far, several static nonlinearities arising in various signal processing problems were shown to exhibit a noise-enhanced effect, such as quantizers [7–11] and nonlinear detectors [1–4,20–30]. Now, this method of enhancement via noise is still under investigation as a technique with useful potential for nonlinear signal processing.In this letter, we focus on the detection enhancement of a weak signal in additive white noise by a generalized correlation detector. With a sufficiently large observation size, the detection performance of the detector is determined by the normalized asymptotic efficacyξGC[31]. We show that both the efficacyξGCand its derivative with respect to the noise level can be analytically computed. This derivative and its condition of positivity are analyzed in various important situations, allowing us to conclude when increasing the level of noise can improve the detection performance, and when it cannot. The result provides not only an easily implemented criterion for exploring the role of noise in detectors, but also the operational levels of noise that we can employ.Consider the observation vectorX=(X1,X2,…,XN)of real-valued componentsXndefined by(1)Xn=θsn+Zn,n=1,2,…,N,where the componentsZnform a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with probability density function (PDF)fzand varianceσz2, and the known signal componentssnhave signal strength θ[31]. The average signal power satisfies0<Ps=∑n=1Nsn2/N<∞[31]. The detection problem can be formulated as a hypothesis-testing problem for deciding a null hypothesisH0(θ=0) and an alternative hypothesisH1(θ>0) associated with the joint probability densities(2)H0:fX(X)=∏n=1Nfz(Xn)forθ=0,H1:fX(X)=∏n=1Nfz(Xn−θsn)forθ>0.In order to decideH0orH1on the basis of X, consider a generalized correlation detector(3)TGC(X)=∑n=1Ng(Xn)sn≷H0H1γ,where the memoryless nonlinearity g has zero mean underfz, i.e.Ez[g(x)]=∫−∞∞g(x)fz(x)dx=0and the test threshold is γ[31]. In the asymptotic case ofθ→0and for a sufficiently large observation size N, the test statisticTGC, according to the central limit theorem, converges to a Gaussian distribution with meanEz[TGC|H0]=0and variancevar[TGC|H0]=Ez[TGC2|H0]=NPsEz[g2(x)]under the null hypothesisH0[31]. Similarly, under the hypothesisH1,TGCis also asymptotically Gaussian with meanEz[TGC|H1]≈θNPsEz[g′(x)]and variancevar[TGC|H1]=var[TGC|H0][31]. Here, the derivativesg′(x)=dg(x)/dxandfz′(x)=dfz(x)/dxexist for almost all x. Given a false alarm probabilityPFA, the detection probabilityPDof the generalized correlation detector can be expressed as(4)PD=Q[Q−1(PFA)−θNPsξGC]=Q[Q−1(PFA)−θ∑n=1Nsn2ξGC],whereQ(x)=∫x∞exp[−t2/2]/2πdtand its inverse function isQ−1[31]. Thus, for fixed N andθPs(since the signal is known),PDis a monotonically increasing function of the normalized asymptotic efficacyξGCgiven by [31](5)ξGC=limN→∞{dEz[TGC(X)]dθ|θ=0}2PsNvar[TGC(X)]|θ=0=Ez2[g′(x)]Ez[g2(x)]⩽Ez[fz′2(x)fz2(x)]=I(fz),where the expectationEz[fz′2(x)/fz2(x)]is the Fisher informationI(fz)offz, and the equality occurs as(6)g(x)=Cfz′(x)fz(x)≜gLO(x),by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for a constant C. Here,gLO(x)represents the locally optimal nonlinearity [31].It is noted thatPDof Eq. (4) is a monotonically increasing function ofξGC. Thus, as the noise levelσzincreases, the positive derivative(7)∂ξGC∂σz>0indicates the occurrence of the noise-enhanced detection phenomenon. When the inequality of Eq. (7) holds for0<σz<σzoptand the equality(8)∂ξGC∂σz|σz=σzopt=0has only one solutionσz=σzopt, thenσzoptis the optimal noise level that maximizesξGC. It is noted that the signal strength θ is small enough to allow us to use the first-order approximations leading to the detection probability of Eq. (4), and the noise-enhanced detection performance indicated by Eq. (7) is valid for arbitrary small signal levelθ>0.In the following, we assume that the scaled noiseZ(t)=σzZ0(t)has PDFfz(z)=fz0(z/σz)/σzand the cumulative distribution functionFz(x)=Fz0(z/σz)[10,31]. Here,Z0(t)has a standardized PDFfz0with unity varianceσz02=1, the cumulative distribution function isFz0(x)=∫−∞xfz0(u)duand the Fisher informationI(fz0)=Ez0[fz0′2(x)/fz02(x)]. Then, the Fisher informationI(fz)=I(fz0)/σz2.Corollary 1No noise-enhanced detection phenomenon will occur in the locally optimal detector(9)TLO(X)=∑n=1NgLO(Xn)sn≷H0H1γ,with the nonlinearitygLOdefined in Eq. (6).ProofFrom Eqs. (5) and (6), the locally optimal detector in Eq. (9) has the normalized asymptotic efficacyξLO=I(fz)>0. Then, forσz>0, we have(10)∂ξLO∂σz=∂I(fz)∂σz=−2I(fz0)σz3<0.Thus, no noise-enhanced detection phenomenon will occur.  □Corollary 2The dead-zone limiter detector(11)TDZ(X)=∑n=1NgDZ(Xn)sn≷H0H1γ,employs the characteristic(12)gDZ(x)={−1forx<−λ,0for−λ⩽x⩽λ,+1forx>λ,with response thresholdλ>0. Given the threshold λ, the noise-enhanced detection effect will occur in the intervalσz∈(0,σzopt), where the optimal noise levelσzoptis the non-zero solution of(13)σzλ=gLOz0(λσz)−fz0(λσz)2[1−Fz0(λσz)],with the nonlinearity(14)gLOz0(x)=−fz0′(x)fz0(x).ProofFrom Eq. (5), the normalized asymptotic efficacyξDZof the dead-zone limiter detector is [31,32](15)ξDZ=Ez2[gDZ′(x)]Ez[gDZ2(x)]=2fz2(λ)1−Fz(λ).Since(16)∂Fz(λ)∂σz=∂Fz0(λ/σz)∂σz=−λfz0(λ/σz)σz2=−λfz(λ)σz,we obtain(17)∂ξDZ∂σz=4fz(λ)∂fz(λ)∂σz[1−Fz(λ)]−2fz2(λ)fz(λ)λσz[1−Fz(λ)]2⩾0,(18)⇒∂fz(λ)∂σz−λσzfz2(λ)2[1−Fz(λ)]⩾0,(19)⇒−λσz3dfz0(xσz)dx|x=λ−1σz2fz0(λσz)⇒−λσz3fz02(λ/σz)2[1−Fz0(λ/σz)]⩾0,(20)⇒σzλ⩽gLOz0(λσz)−fz0(λσz)2[1−Fz0(λσz)],where the equality of Eq. (20) gives the non-zero solutionσzopt. The numerical solution ofσzoptcan refer to [33]. When the noise level0<σz<σzopt, the derivative∂ξDZ/∂σz>0, and the noise-enhanced effect will appear in the dead-zone limiter detector of Eq. (11).  □Example 1The non-Gaussian noise is often useful for modeling practical noisy environments where signals and systems are operated [31,32]. For example, a non-Gaussian model is the generalized Gaussian noise with PDF(21)fz(x)=c1σzexp(−c2|xσz|α),wherec1=α2Γ12(3α)/Γ32(1α)andc2=[Γ(3α)/Γ(1α)]α2. A positive exponent α allows us conveniently consider a spectrum of densities ranging from the Gaussian to those with relatively much faster or slower rates of exponential decay of their tails [31]. The corresponding nonlinearity of Eq. (14) is(22)gLOz0(x)=αc2|x|α−1sign(x).For the dead-zone limiter detector of Eq. (11), Eq. (13) becomes(23)σzλ=αc2|λσz|α−1−c1exp(−c2|λσz|α)2[1−Fz0(λσz)].Without loss of generality, the response threshold takesλ=1, and the optimal noise levelσzoptis shown in Fig. 1(a) as a function of the exponent α. It is illustrated in Fig. 1(b) that, as the noise levelσzincreases from zero toσzopt, the normalized asymptotic efficacyξDZis enhanced to its maximum for different exponentsα=0.5,1,2,5and ∞. Fig. 1(a) also shows that, as the exponent α increases, the optimal level ofσzopttends to a constant value of1/3, which is just the optimal noise levelσzoptcorresponding toα=∞(uniform noise), as shown in Fig. 1(b).Corollary 3No noise-enhanced detection phenomenon will occur for the sign detector of Eq. (11)with thresholdλ=0and characteristicgDZ(x)=sign(x).ProofFrom Eq. (5), the normalized asymptotic efficacyξDZof the sign detector is(24)ξDZ=Ez2[gDZ′(x)]Ez[gDZ2(x)]=4fz2(0)=4fz02(0)σz2.Then, we find(25)∂ξDZ∂σz=−8fz02(0)σz3⩽0,forσz>0. Therefore, no noise-enhanced detection phenomenon will occur.  □The received signal is often corrupted by noise before it arrives at the detector. We now add additional noise to a given observation vector X in the context of SR. The updated components(26)Xˆn=θsn+Zn+Yn=θsn+Wn,where the added i.i.d. random variablesYnare with PDFfyand varianceσy2. Then, the composite componentsWnhave a convolved PDFfw(x)=∫−∞∞fy(x−u)fz(u)du. In this case, the normalized asymptotic efficacy of Eq. (5) is updated as(27)ξˆGC=Ew2[g′(x)]Ew[g2(x)]⩽Ew[fw′2(x)fw2(x)]=ξˆLO=I(fw),with the Fisher informationI(fw)offw. Here, the equality is achieved by an updated locally optimal detector(28)TˆLO(Xˆ)=∑n=1NgˆLO(Xˆn)sn≷H0H1γ,based on the locally optimal nonlinearity(29)gˆLO(x)=Cfw′(x)fw(x).Furthermore, we assumefw(x)=fw0(x/σw)/σw, andfw0is the standardized noise PDF with unity variance. Then, we have the following corollaries.Corollary 4No noise-enhanced detection phenomenon will occur in the updated locally optimal detector of Eq. (28).ProofFor the composite noise componentsWn, the noise varianceσw2=σz2+σy2and the initial noise varianceσz2is fixed. Then, we have(30)∂ξˆLO∂σy=∂ξˆLO∂σw∂σw∂σy=∂I(fw)∂σwσyσz2+σy2=−2σyI(fw0)σw4<0,whereI(fw0)>0is the Fisher information offw0. Then, Corollary 4 is deduced.  □Corollary 5When the noise level0<σy<σyopt, the noise-enhanced detection phenomenon will occur for the dead-zone limiter detector of Eq. (11). Here, for a fixed noise levelσz, the optimal noise level(31)σyopt=(σwopt)2−σz2,andσwoptis the non-zero solution of(32)σwλ=gˆLOw0(λσw)−fw0(λσw)2[1−Fw0(λσw)],with the nonlinearity(33)gˆLOw0(x)=−fw0′(x)fw0(x).ProofFor the composite noise componentsWn, the normalized asymptotic efficacy of the dead-zone limiter detector of Eq. (11) can be calculated as(34)ξˆDZ=Ew2[gDZ′(x)]Ew[gDZ2(x)]=2fw2(λ)1−Fw(λ),whereFwrepresents the cumulative distribution function ofWn. Then, the noise-enhanced detection effect will occur as(35)∂ξˆDZ∂σy=∂ξˆDZ∂σw∂σw∂σy=∂ξˆDZ∂σwσyσw⩾0⇒∂ξˆDZ∂σw⩾0.The demonstration is similar to the proof of Corollary 2, and the occurrence condition is indicated by Eq. (32). Correspondingly, the optimal added noise levelσyoptandσwoptcan be solved by Eqs. (31) and (32).  □Example 2Assume the initial Gaussian noise componentsZnare with PDFfz(x)=12πσz2exp(−x22σz2)and fixed varianceσz2. The added uniform random variablesYnhave PDFfy(x)=1/(2b)for−b⩽x⩽band zero otherwise. The composite random variablesWnhave PDF(36)fw(x)=Q(x−bσz)−Q(x+bσz)2b.For the dead-zone limiter detector in Eq. (11), the normalized asymptotic efficacy of Eq. (34) can be expressed as(37)ξˆDZ=[Q(λ−bσz)−Q(λ+bσz)]2∫λ∞b[Q(x−bσz)−Q(x+bσz)]dx.Then, the noise-enhanced effect will occur for∂ξˆDZ/∂b⩾0, this is(38)2[fz(λ−b)+fz(λ+b)]∫λ∞b[Q(x−bσz)−Q(x+bσz)]dx−[Q(λ−bσz)−Q(λ+bσz)]{∫λ∞[Q(x−bσz)−Q(x+bσz)]dx+b[fz(x−b)+fz(x+b)]dx}⩾0,(39)⇒4b2[fz(λ−b)+fz(λ+b)]∫λ∞fw(x)dx−2b2fw(λ){2∫λ∞fw(x)dx+[Q(λ−bσz)+Q(λ+bσz)]}⩾0.Thus, the optimal uniform noise levelboptcan be solved by(40)fw(λ)[Q(λ−bσz)+Q(λ+bσz)]+2fw(λ)[1−Fw(λ)]=2[fz(λ−b)+fz(λ+b)][1−Fw(λ)],and the noise-enhanced effect will occur as the uniform level0<b<bopt. Without loss of generality, the response threshold takesλ=1, and the optimal uniform noise levelboptis plotted in Fig. 2(a) as a function of the initial Gaussian noise levelσz. For instance, when the initial Gaussian noise levelσz=0.3, the corresponding normalized asymptotic efficacy of Eq. (15) isξDZ=0.1232without the addition of uniform noise (b=0). Whenb<bopt=1.02, the addition of uniform noise is helpful for weak signal detection, as shown in Fig. 2(b). We see that the normalized asymptotic efficacy can be improved up toξˆDZ=2.092atbopt=1.02, as illustrated in Fig. 2(b).An important issue is that, for a given noise levelσz, we can tune the threshold λ to maximize the normalized asymptotic efficacyξDZ[23,29–32]. Michels et al. demonstrated that the normalized asymptotic efficacy of the tuned dead-zone limiter detector with optimal thresholdλoptcannot be improved by adding noise to the signal [30] (Section 5.3, pp. 33–35). For the case of where the threshold is not optimal, they further proved that the optimal detection performance can be achieved by adding independent dichotomous noise [23]. For a fixed threshold λ, Corollaries 2 and 5 apply our general characterization to the dead-zone limiter detector for any type of scaled noise. The optimal noise level can be solved by Eq. (13) and Eq. (32).For the scaled noise PDFfz(x)=fz0(x/σz)/σzwith a given noise levelσzand based on Eq. (15), the optimum thresholdλoptcan be solved by(41)∂ξDZ∂λ=0,(42)⇒4fz(λ)fz′(λ)[1−Fz(λ)]+2fz2(λ)fz(λ)=0,(43)⇒2gLOz0(λ/σz)[1−Fz0(λ/σz)]−fz0(λ/σz)=0.In Example 2, the initial Gaussian noise is with a given noise levelσz, Eq. (43) yields the optimal thresholdλopt=0.612σz. Thus, the fixed thresholdλ=1is optimal for the initial noise levelσz=1.634. It is shown in Fig. 2(a) that, for the fixed thresholdλ=1, the non-zero solution of added uniform noise levelboptonly exits for the initial Gaussian noise level0<σz<0.61. In other words, for the given initial noise levelσz>0.61(including the optimal matching noise levelσz=1.634for thresholdλ=1), no enhancement by noise can take place. In this respect, our results here accord with the conclusions of [29,30] that the normalized asymptotic efficacy of the dead-zone limiter detector with optimal threshold cannot be improved by adding noise, but the SR effect is possible when the threshold is not optimal for the initial given noise level.The constructive role of internal noise has been adequately reappraised for improving the performance of an array of nonlinearities [3,4,7–10]. Compared with an isolated nonlinearity, the performance of an array can be much improved by the internal noise [3,4,7–10]. Moreover, the positive role of noise does not need to occur for an isolated nonlinearity, but can come into play in a parallel array of nonlinearities [4,7–10].LetXˆm=(Xˆm1,Xˆm2,…,XˆmN)be the vector of N observation components at the m-th element of receiving array of M identical nonlinearities. In this observation model [4],Xˆmn=Xn+Ymn=θsn+Zn+Ymn=θsn+Wmn. Here, in each nonlinearity g, the M noise termsYmare assumed to be mutually independent with the same PDFfyand varianceσy2. Then, at the observed time n, the array outputs are collected asg¯n=∑m=1Mg(Xˆmn)/M, and the generalized correlation detector can be constructed as(44)TGC(Xˆ)=∑n=1Ng¯nsn≷H0H1γ.The statisticTGCis also asymptotically Gaussian for a sufficiently large observed size N. Under the null hypothesisH0, the meanEw[TGC|H0]=Ew[g(w)]∑n=1Nsn=0and the variance(45)var[TGC|H0]=Ew[TGC2|H0]−Ew2[TGC|H0]=NPsEz{1M2∑m=1M∑k=1MEy[g(Wm)g(Wk)]}=NPsM2Ez{MEy[g2(Wm)]+M(M−1)Ey[g(Wm)g(Wk)]}(∀m≠k)=NPsM{Ew[g2(w)]+(M−1)Ez{Ey2[g(y+z)]}},whereEz{Ey[g(Wm)g(Wk)]}=Ez{Ey2[g(w)]}=Ez{Ey2[g(y+z)]}. Under the hypothesisH1and as the signal strengthθ→0, the mean has the asymptotic form(46)Ew[TGC|H1]=Ew[∑n=1N1M∑m=1Mg(θsn+Wmn)sn]≈Ew{∑n=1N[g(w)+θsng′(w)]sn}=Ew[∑n=1Nθsn2g′(w)]=θNPsEw[g′(w)],and variancevar[TGC|H1]≈var[TGC|H0]. Then, the normalized asymptotic efficacy of the detector in Eq. (44) is given by(47)ξˆGC=limN→∞{dEw[TGC(Xˆ)]dθ|θ=0}2NPsvar[TGC(Xˆ)]|θ=0=Ew2[g′(w)]1MEw[g2(w)]+M−1MEz{Ey2[g(y+z)]}.Example 3We choose the characteristicg(x)=sign(x)in the detector of Eq. (44). The initial noiseZ(t)is Gaussian distributed, and the M array noise termsYm(t)are uniformly random variables. The composite noiseWm(t)are with the convolved PDFfwof Eq. (36), as indicated in Example 2. Therefore, the normalized asymptotic efficacy is computed as(48)ξˆDZ=4fw2(0)1MEw[sign2(w)]+M−1MEz{Ey2[sign(z+y)]}=4fw2(0)1M+M−1MEz[(|z+b|−|z−b|)24b2].Since the noise-enhanced phenomenon occurs when∂ξˆDZ/∂b⩾0, it is found that the optimal noise levelboptis the solution of(49)[fw(0)−fz(b)]{1+(M−1)Ez[(|z+b|−|z−b|)24b2]}=(M−1)fw(0)Ez{(|z+b|−|z−b|)22b2−(|z+b|−|z−b|)[sign(z+b)+sign(z−b)]2b}.For the array sizeM=1, Eq. (49) yieldsfw(0)−fz(b)=0and the optimal uniform noise levelbopt=0. Thus, there is no noise-enhanced effect in the detector of Eq. (44) with a single nonlinearity. For a fixed Gaussian noise levelσz=0.3, the optimal added uniform noise levelboptis illustrated as a function of the array size M in Fig. 3(a). It is shown in Fig. 3(b) that the normalized asymptotic efficacyξˆDZvaries as a function of added uniform noise level b for different array sizes. For a single nonlinearity g, it is seen that the added uniform noise is no use for the performance enhancement of the detector (M=1). AsM⩾2, it is seen in Fig. 3(b) that the added uniform noise can enhance the normalized asymptotic efficacyξˆDZ, and the noise-enhanced effect does occur. Moreover, as the array size M increases, the peak value ofξˆDZis also improved gradually by tuning the added uniform noise level into the corresponding optimal value ofbopt, as shown in Fig. 3(b).
