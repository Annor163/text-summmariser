@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We present algorithms for computing the differential geometry properties of lines of curvature of parametric surfaces. We derive a unit tangent vector, curvature vector, binormal vector, torsion, and algorithms to evaluate their higher-order derivatives of lines of curvature of parametric surfaces. Among these quantities, it is shown that the curvature and its first derivative of the lines of curvature lend a hand for the formation of curved plates in shipbuilding. We also visualize the twist of lines of curvature, which enables us to observe how much the osculating plane of the line of curvature turns about the tangent vector.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A curve on a surface whose tangent at each point is in a principal direction at that point is called a line of curvature. This line indicates a directional flow of the maximum or minimum curvature across the surface [1–4]. At each non-umbilical point there exist two principal directions that are orthogonal, and hence the lines of curvature form an orthogonal net of lines. An umbilic is a point on a surface where all normal curvatures are equal, and thus the principal directions are indeterminate. Therefore, the orthogonal net of lines of curvature becomes singular at umbilics.In addition to the above properties, there are a few more interesting differential geometry properties to note about the lines of curvature. A necessary and sufficient condition for a curve on a surface to be a line of curvature is that the surface normals along the curve form a developable surface [5,6]. Another interesting property of the line of curvature is that the geodesic torsion vanishes along the curve [7]. The geodesic torsion, which depends only on the surface point P and the given direction at P, is the torsion of the geodesic in the given direction at P on the surface [7].There are several interesting applications of umbilics and lines of curvature. The umbilical points have generic features and act like fingerprints for shape recognition. Maekawa et al. [3] investigated the generic features of the umbilics and behavior of lines of curvature that pass through an umbilic on a parametric free-form surface. Ko et al. [8] used umbilics for partial matching of two free-form objects with scaling effects.Principal patches, which were introduced by Martin [9], are bounded by lines of curvature. Construction of such patches is very difficult except for that of simple surfaces such as surfaces of revolution and Dupin cyclides. Srinivas et al. [10] described a method to construct a topologically rectangular network of cyclide patches for surface design.Kalogerakis et al. [11] extracted lines of curvature from point clouds, a method that is applicable to surfaces of arbitrary genus and is robust to noise and outliers. The method can be used to construct curvature-aligned quad-dominant meshes directly from point clouds. Zhao et al. [12] explored the potential use of lines of curvature for detecting colonic polyps in virtual colonoscopy. Kobashi et al. [13] presented a unifying technique that enables us to use surface interrogation tools developed for B-spline surfaces for triangular mesh models, including first-order surface interrogation methods such as reflection lines and circular highlight lines [14], and second-order surface interrogation methods such as the computation of geodesics [15], geodesic offsets, lines of curvature, and the detection of umbilics.Recently, Matsuo and Matsuoka [16] introduced a method to flatten doubly curved plates used in shipbuilding allowing only expansion into a planar shape using lines of curvature, so that a manufacturer can determine the initial shape of the plate to cut and estimate the amount of contraction required to form the shape by line heating. When a metal plate is heated locally, the material near the heated region expands and at the same time it becomes softer. However, the surrounding material has its original strength, therefore, when it is cooled down, the heated region contracts. This process induces plate bending. The prediction of angular deformations of metal plates due to line heating has been discussed exhaustively by Yu et al. [17]. The doubly curved plate is first bent by cold bending. This is performed by pressing along the line of curvature with a small curvature magnitude, which forces the plate to bend along the line of curvature with a larger curvature magnitude, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Next, the plate is bent along the line of curvature with a larger curvature magnitude by hot bending by means of a local heat treatment, which forces the plate to bend along the lines of curvature with a small curvature magnitude as shown in Fig. 1(b).Che et al. [18] investigated the lines of curvature and their differential geometry properties including curvature and torsion defined on implicit surfaces. However, to the best of our knowledge, curvatures and torsions associated with lines of curvature on parametric surfaces have not been studied.In this paper, we derive the unit tangent vector, curvature vector, binormal vector, and torsion of lines of curvature of parametric surfaces. We also generalize these evaluation methods to evaluate the higher-order derivatives of curvatures and the torsions. Furthermore, we visualize the twist along the lines of curvature through the rotation of the rectangular voxels representing the Frenet frame.Finally, we apply our techniques for the computation of exact geodesic curvature to the development of doubly curved plates using the method developed by Matsuo and Matsuoka [16].The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we briefly review the differential geometry of curves, surfaces, and curves on a surface including a method to compute lines of curvature. In Section 3, we introduce a novel method to calculate the curvatureκand torsionτof lines of curvature. Furthermore, we discuss degenerate as well as singular cases. In Section 4, we generalize the torsion calculation algorithm to obtain the higher-order derivatives ofκandτ. In Section 5, we provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In Section 6, we conclude the paper.In this section, we briefly review the differential geometry of space curves, surfaces, and curves on surface including a method to compute lines of curvature [19,20,4,21,3]. We first introduce some notation and definitions. Bold letters such ascandRdenote vectors and vector functions, respectively. We assume that they are smooth enough so that all the (partial) derivatives given in the paper are meaningful. The dot (scalar) product and cross (vector) product of two vectorsaandbare expressed asa·banda×b, respectively. The prime′denotes differentiation with respect to the arc-length s, e.g.,c′(s)=dcds,c″(s)=d2cds2. When the number of primes exceeds four, it is replaced by the superscript (m) where m is the number of primes, e.g.,c(4)=c⁗. The lowercase subscript lettersu,vdenote partial derivatives corresponding to the indicated variable, e.g.,ru=∂r∂u,ruv=∂2r∂u∂v. The other lowercase subscript letters such asp,n,g,mare used to distinguish between related quantities.Letc(s)=(x(s),y(s),z(s))be an arc-length-parametrized space curve. We denote the unit tangent, principal normal, and the binormal vectors ofc(s)byt,n, andb, respectively. The vectorst,n, andbin this order form a right-handed orthonormal triplet, or the so-called Frenet frame. As the parameter s traces the curvec(s), the Frenet frame changes its orientation. The local rate of change of the frame can be expressed by the frame itself. The resulting equations are called Frenet-Serret formulas:(1)t′=κn,(2)n′=-κt+τb,(3)b′=-τn,where the factorκis called the curvature andτis the torsion. The torsion measures the rotation of the Frenet frame about the tangent vector. The first three derivatives ofc(s)are evaluated as follows:(4)c′(s)=t,(5)c″(s)=k=κn,(6)c‴(s)=κ′n+κn′,wherekis the curvature vector. It follows from (5) that(7)κ2=k·k=c″·c″.We can replacen′in (6) by the second equation in the Frenet-Serret formulas (2), yielding [21]:(8)c‴(s)=-κ2t+κ′n+κτb.The fourth-order derivative ofc(s), i.e.,c(4)(s)can be obtained by differentiating Eq. (8) and replacingt′,n′, andb′using the Frenet-Serret formulas.(9)c(4)(s)=-3κκ′t+(κ″-κτ2-κ3)n+(2κ′τ+κτ′)b=C4tt+C4nn+C4bb,where(10)C4t=-3κκ′,C4n=κ″-κτ2-κ3,C4b=2κ′τ+κτ′.In general, the m-th order derivative can be expressed as(11)c(m)(s)=Cmtt+Cmnn+Cmbb.A point(x,y,z)on a parametric surface is expressed as functions of parameters u and v in a closed rectangle:(12)R(u,v)=(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)),where0⩽u⩽1,0⩽v⩽1.A unit surface normal vector of the parametric surface is defined by(13)N=Ru×Rv|Ru×Rv|.The unit tangent vectortand the unit normal vectornof a curvec(s) on a surfaceR(u, v) are related as follows:(14)k=dtds=κn=kn+kg=κnN+κgU,whereknis the normal curvature vector andkgis the geodesic curvature vector, which are the components of the curvature vectorkofc(s)in the surface normal direction and directionUdefined byU=N×t, respectively, andκnandκgare the normal and geodesic curvatures, respectively.A normal curvature at point P is given by(15)κn=L+2Mλ+Nλ2E+2Fλ+Gλ2,whereλ=dvduis the direction of the line tangent to the curve passing throughP;E,F, and G are the first fundamental form coefficients; andL,M, and N are the second fundamental form coefficients. The extreme values ofκncan be obtained by evaluatingdκndλ=0in (15), which gives(16)(E+2Fλ+Gλ2)(Nλ+M)-(L+2Mλ+Nλ2)(Gλ+F)=0,and hence,(17)κn=L+2Mλ+Nλ2E+2Fλ+Gλ2=M+NλF+Gλ=L+MλE+Fλ.Therefore, the extreme values ofκnsatisfy the two simultaneous equations(18)(L-κnE)du+(M-κnF)dv=0,(M-κnF)du+(N-κnG)dv=0.These equations form a homogeneous linear system of equations for du and dv, which will have a non-trivial solution if and only if(19)detL-κnEM-κnFM-κnFN-κnG=0,wheredet||denotes the determinant of a matrix, or by expansion(20)(EG-F2)κn2-(EN+GL-2FM)κn+(LN-M2)=0.Since the Gaussian curvature K and mean curvature H are given by(21)K=LN-M2EG-F2,H=EN+GL-2FM2(EG-F2),the quadratic equation forκn(20) is simplified to(22)κn2-2Hκn+K=0.Solving the quadratic equation yields(23)κ1=H+H2-K,κ2=H-H2-K,whereκ1is the maximum principal curvature andκ2is the minimum principal curvature. The directions in the tangent plane for whichκntakes maximum and minimum values are called the principal directions.The geodesic curvature ofc(s)at P is given by(24)κg=Γ112duds3+2Γ122-Γ111duds2dvds+Γ222-2Γ121dudsdvds2-Γ221dvds3+dudsd2vds2-d2uds2dvdsEG-F2,whereΓjki(i,j,k=1,2) are Christoffel symbols defined as follows:(25)Γ111=GEu-2FFu+FEv2(EG-F2),Γ112=2EFu-EEv-FEu2(EG-F2)Γ121=GEv-FGu2(EG-F2),Γ122=EGu-FEv2(EG-F2)Γ221=2GFv-GGu-FGv2(EG-F2),Γ222=EGv-2FFv+FGu2(EG-F2).Let us denote a curve on a surface asc(s)=R(u(s),v(s)). We can determine the derivatives of the curves on surfacesc′(s),c″(s),c‴(s),c(4)(s),…,c(m)(s)using the chain rule, as follows:(26)c′(s)=Ruu′+Rvv′,(27)c″(s)=Ruu(u′)2+2Ruvu′v′+Rvv(v′)2+Ruu″+Rvv″,(28)c‴(s)=Ruuu(u′)3+3Ruuv(u′)2v′+3Ruvvu′(v′)2(29)+Rvvv(v′)3+3[Ruuu′u″+Ruv(u″v′+u′v″)+Rvvv′v″]+Ruu‴+Rvv‴,c(4)(s)=Ruuuu(u′)4+4Ruuuv(u′)3v′+6Ruuvv(u′)2(u′)2+4Ruvvv(v′)3u′+Rvvvv(v′)4+6[Ruuu(u′)2u″+Ruuv(2u′u″v′+(u′)2v″)+Ruvv(2v′v″u′+(v′)2u″)+Rvvv(v′)2v″]+Ruu(3(u″)2+4u′u‴)+Ruv(4u‴v′+6u″v″+4v‴u′)+Rvv(3(v″)2+4v′v‴)+Ruu(4)+Rvv(4)(30)⋮c(m)(s)=αm+Ruu(m)+Rvv(m),whereαmdenotes the sum of the terms that includeu′,u″,u,…,u(m-1)andv′,v″,v,…,v(m-1).Every principal curvature direction vector must fulfill (18). Hence, from the first equation in (18), where we replaceκnbyκprepresenting eitherκ1orκ2, we obtain(31)u′=η(M-κpF),v′=-η(L-κpE),where the non-zero factorηis determined by applying the normalization condition of the first fundamental form(32)E(u′)2+2Fu′v′+G(v′)2=1,which imposes the curvature line as an arc-length parametrized curve. This in turn, results in(33)η=±1E(M-κpF)2-2F(M-κpF)(L-κpE)+G(L-κpE)2.Since a principal curvature direction vector must also fulfill the second equation in (18), we obtain(34)u′=μ(N-κpG),v′=-μ(M-κpF).Likewise,μis determined to be(35)μ=±1E(N-κpG)2-2F(N-κpG)(M-κpF)+G(M-κpF)2.It is possible that the coefficients in (31) can both be zero or small in absolute value, while those of (34) are not both zero or the other equation contains one coefficient which is large in absolute value. SinceM-κpFis a common coefficient, we have implemented the algorithm dependent on the size of the coefficients, if|L-κpE|⩾|N-κpG|, we solve (31) otherwise we solve (34)[3]. In order to save the space of the paper, we only discuss cases with (31) for the rest of the paper.Details regarding the manner in which a system of differential equations should be used, and how the signs ofηandμare determined, are fully discussed in [3,4]. We can trace the lines of curvature by integrating the initial value problem for a system of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations using standard numerical techniques [22] such as the Runge–Kutta method.In this paper, we assume that lines of curvature do not pass through umbilics. The generic features of lines of curvature near an umbilic are fully discussed in [3].The lines of curvature are evaluated as the solution of initial value problem of the coupled non-linear differential Eq. (31). The solution generates a sequence of parameter pairs(uk,vk)which yield an ordered set of estimated points along the lines of curvature. Previous work computed the differential geometry properties of the curve such as curvatures and torsions using the information at these discrete points by finite-differences [16]. In contrast, we completely define them in terms of surface parameterization using the fact the discrete points are on the lines of curvature. This allows these differential geometry quantities to be evaluated exactly at the estimated points on the line of curvature, avoiding problems with discretization errors that arise when estimating higher-order derivatives by finite-differences.A line of curvature can be considered as a space curve as well as a curve on a surface. Thus, we can equate the second order derivatives (5) and (27) along a line of curvature as follows:(36)c″(s)=κpN+κgU=Ruu″+Rvv″+α2,where(37)α2=Ruu(u′)2+2Ruvu′v′+Rvv(v′)2.Note thatu′andv′are evaluated by (31), or (34), and hencetcan be obtained using (26). Taking a dot product withRuandRvon both sides of Eq. (36), we obtain(38)Eu″+Fv″-κg(U·Ru)=-α2·Ru,(39)Fu″+Gv″-κg(U·Rv)=-α2·Rv.There are three unknowns in Eqs. (38) and (39), namely,u″,v″, andκg. Accordingly, we need a third equation to solve the system, which can be obtained by differentiating the first equation of (18):(40)(L-κpE)u″+(M-κpF)v″=β1.where(41)β1=-(L′-κp′E-κpE′)u′-(M′-κp′F-κpF′)v′.The derivatives of the first and second fundamental form coefficients, and the principal curvatures with respect to the arc-length can be obtained using the chain rule which are listed in Appendix A.2.Combining (38)–(40) we obtain the following linear system:(42)EF-(U·Ru)FG-(U·Rv)L-κpEM-κpF0u″v″κg=-α2·Ru-α2·Rvβ1.The curvature can be obtained by(43)κ=κn2+κg2.As in the curvature computation in Section 3.1, we equate the third-order derivatives (8) and (28) to obtain(44)c‴(s)=C3tt+C3nn+C3bb=Ruu‴+Rvv‴+α3,whereC3t=-κ2,C3n=κ′,C3b=κτ, and(45)α3=Ruuu(u′)3+3Ruuv(u′)2v′+3Ruvvu′(v′)2+Rvvv(v′)3+3[Ruuu′u″+Ruv(u″v′+u′v″)+Rvvv′v″].Note thatncan be obtained using (27). Taking a dot product withRuandRvon both sides of Eq. (44), we obtain(46)Eu‴+Fv‴-(n·Ru)κ′-κ(b·Ru)τ=-α3·Ru-κ2t·Ru,(47)Fu‴+Gv‴-(n·Rv)κ′-κ(b·Rv)τ=-α3·Rv-κ2t·Rv.Furthermore, taking a dot product with n on both sides of Eq. (44), we obtain(48)(n·Ru)u‴+(n·Rv)v‴-κ′=-α3·n.There are four unknowns in Eqs. (46)–(48), i.e.,u‴,v‴,κ′, andτ. The fourth equation can be obtained by taking the second-order derivative of the first equation of (18) to yield(49)(L-κpE)u‴+(M-κpF)v‴=β2.where(50)β2=-2L′-κp′E-κpE′u″+2M′-κp′F-κpF′v″+L″-κp″E-2κp′E′-κpE″u′+M″-κp″F-2κp′F′-κpF″v′.Combining (46)–(49), we obtain the following linear system:(51)EF-(n·Ru)-κ(b·Ru)FG-(n·Rv)-κ(b·Rv)(n·Ru)(n·Rv)-10L-κpEM-κpF00u‴v‴κ′τ=-α3·Ru-κ2t·Ru-α3·Rv-κ2t·Rv-α3·nβ2.Ifκ=0andκ′≠0, the Frenet frame of the curve is not defined. In such cases, Eq. (8) degenerates toc‴(s)=κ′n, and we have(52)c‴(s)=κ′n=α3+Ruu‴+Rvv‴.First, we apply a dot product with t on both sides of Eq. (52), which yields(53)(t·Ru)u‴+(t·Rv)v‴=-α3·t.Together with (49) we obtain the following2×2linear system:(54)(t·Ru)(t·Rv)(L-κpE)(M-κpF)u‴v‴=-α3·tβ2,Solving these equations foru‴andv‴, we can calculateκ′as follows:(55)(κ′)2=c‴(s)·c‴(s),and the principal normal is obtained by(56)n=c‴(s)κ′.The torsion can be computed from the fourth-order derivatives of the curve c(s), which is given by(57)c(4)(s)=κ″n+2κ′τb=α4+Ruu(4)+Rvv(4),where(58)α4=Ruuuu(u′)4+4Ruuuv(u′)3v′+6Ruuvv(u′)2(u′)2+4Ruvvv(v′)3u′+Rvvvv(v′)4+6Ruuu(u′)2u″+Ruuv(2u′u″v′+(u′)2v″)+Ruvv(2v′v″u′+(v′)2u″)+Rvvv(v′)2v″+Ruu(3(u″)2+4u′u‴)+Ruv(4u‴v′+6u″v″+4v‴u′)+Rvv(3(v″)2+4v′v‴).We apply a dot product withRu,Rv, andnon both sides of Eq. (57), yielding(59)Eu(4)+Fv(4)-(n·Ru)κ″-2κ′(b·Ru)τ=-α4·Ru,(60)Fu(4)+Gv(4)-(n·Rv)κ″-2κ′(b·Rv)τ=-α4·Rv,(61)(n·Ru)u(4)+(n·Rv)v(4)-κ″=-α4·n.Furthermore, the third-order derivative of the first equation of (18) is evaluated as(62)(L-κpE)u(4)+(M-κpF)v(4)=β3.where(63)β3={(L-κpE)u(4)+(M-κpF)v(4)}-d(3)ds(3){(L-κpE)u′+(M-κpF)v′}.Accordingly, the linear system is obtained as(64)EF-(n·Ru)-2κ′(b·Ru)FG-(n·Rv)-2κ′(b·Rv)(n·Ru)(n·Rv)-10L-κpEM-κpF00u(4)v(4)κ″τ=-α4·Ru-α4·Rv-α4·nβ3.In general, ifκ=κ′=⋯=κ(m-4)=0andκ(m-3)≠0, then we have(65)c(m)(s)=κ(m-2)n+(m-2)κ(m-3)τb=αm+Ruu(m)+Rvv(m),and applying a dot product withRu,Rv, andnon both sides of Eq. (65) yields(66)Eu(m)+Fv(m)-(n·Ru)κ(m-2)-(m-2)κ(m-3)(b·Ru)τ=-αm·Ru,(67)Fu(m)+Gv(m)-(n·Rv)κ(m-2)-(m-2)κ(m-3)(b·Rv)τ=-αm·Rv,(68)(n·Ru)u(m)+(n·Rv)v(m)-κ(m-2)=-αm·n.The(m-1)th order derivative of the first equation of (18) can be expressed as follows:(69)(L-κpE)u(m)+(M-κpF)v(m)=βm-1,where(70)βm-1={(L-κpE)u(m)+(M-κpF)v(m)}-d(m-1)ds(m-1){(L-κpE)u′+(M-κpF)v′}.Finally, the linear system is constructed as(71)EF-(n·Ru)-(m-2)κ(m-3)(b·Ru)FG-(n·Rv)-(m-2)κ(m-3)(b·Rv)(n·Ru)(n·Rv)-10L-κpEM-κpF00u(m)v(m)κ(m-2)τ=-αm·Ru-αm·Rv-αm·nβm-1.There are cases when the determinant of a3×3matrix (42) or that of a4×4matrix (51) becomes zero. In this section, we examine the conditions when these determinants become zero, and discuss how to deal with these cases.The determinant of the3×3matrix in (42) is given by(72)detEF-(U·Ru)FG-(U·Rv)L-κpEM-κpF0={-F(M-κpF)+G(L-κpE)}Ru+{EM-FL}Rv·U=(αRu+βRv)·U,where(73)α={-F(M-κpF)+G(L-κpE)},β={EM-FL}.The determinant vanishes under the conditionα=β=0, which leads toL=κpE,M=κpF,N=κpG, and hence it is equivalent for a point to be an umbilic. However, since we assume that the lines of curvature will not pass through umbilics, this condition does not occur. On the other hand, the determinant also vanishes when the vectorsαRu+βRvandUare orthogonal. Note that the vectorsαRu+βRvandUlie on the same tangent plane. For surface of revolutions, parametric lines coincide with lines of curvature, thus we haveu′=η(M-κpF)=0, sinceF=M=0. Because the tangents of the parametric lines and lines of curvature coincide, the tangents in u direction will have the relationRu=c(Ruu′+Rvv′). If we apply a dot product withRvto both sides of the equation, we obtainGv′=0, and hencev′=0. Accordingly, the determinant (72) becomes zero. In contrast, the determinant based on the other pair of Eq. (34) does not vanish. Since|L-κpE|=0<|N-κpG|, the algorithm for the computation of lines of curvature automatically chooses (34), and hence we are able to avoid the singular cases.The determinant of the4×4matrix in (51) is given by(74)detEF-(n·Ru)-κ(b·Ru)FG-(n·Rv)-κ(b·Rv)(n·Ru)(n·Rv)-10L-κpEM-κpF00=κ{F(M-κpF)-G(L-κpE)}Ru+{-E(M-κpF)+F(L-κpE)}Rv·b,where the vector identity(A·C)(B·D)-(B·C)(A·D)=(A×B)·(C×D)is used in the derivation. Thus, the condition for the matrix to be singular can be described as(75)(γRu+δRv)·b=0,where(76)γ=κ{F(M-κpF)-G(L-κpE)},δ=κ{-E(M-κpF)+F(L-κpE)}.It is clear from (76) thatγandδwill vanish at the same time, whenκ=0. Although bothγandδvanish together at umbilics and singular points, these points are not considered in this paper. Since the vectorγRu+δRvlies on the tangent plane of the surface at the evaluation point, the condition (75) implies that the line of curvature is planar (κ=κg) at the point, and hence the torsion is zero. In such cases, we solve foru‴,v‴, andκ′using the left upper3×3matrix in (51) as follows:(77)EF-(n·Ru)FG-(n·Rv)(n·Ru)(n·Rv)-1u‴v‴κ′=-α3·Ru-κ2t·Ru-α3·Rv-κ2t·Rv-α3·n.On the other hand whenγRu+δRvis parallel to the principal direction, the condition (75) is also satisfied. However, this case will never occur, as it violates the fact that the first fundamental form is always positive.We have introduced algorithms to evaluate curvature and torsion of lines of curvature in Section 3. In this section we show that these algorithms can be easily generalized to high-order derivatives.We can generalize the algorithms introduced in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 to evaluate the higher-order derivatives ofκandτof the line of curvature. Equating (11) and (30), we obtain(78)c(m)(s)=Cmtt+Cmnn+Cmbb=αm+Ruu(m)+Rvv(m).It is observed from (9) that the coefficient of the highest-order derivative ofκinc(m)(s)is inCmnand that it is 1, while the coefficient of the highest-order derivative ofτinc(m)(s)is inCmband it isκ.Based on these observations, we can rewrite the coefficientsCmnandCmbas follows.(79)C‾mn=Cmn-κ(m-2),(80)C‾mb=Cmb-κτ(m-3).Taking a dot product withRu,Rv, andnon both sides of Eq. (78), and using (79) and (80), we obtain(81)Eu(m)+Fv(m)-(n·Ru)κ(m-2)-κ(b·Ru)τ(m-3)=-αm·Ru+Cmtt·Ru+C‾mnn·Ru+C‾mbb·Ru,(82)Fu(m)+Gv(m)-(n·Rv)κ(m-2)-κ(b·Rv)τ(m-3)=-αm·Rv+Cmtt·Rv+C‾mnn·Rv+C‾mbb·Rv,(83)(Ru·n)u(m)+(Rv·n)v(m)-κ(m-2)=C‾mn-αm·n.There are four unknowns in Eqs. (81)–(83), namely,u(m),v(m),κ(m-2), andτ(m-3). The fourth equation is derived by taking the (m-1) th-order derivative of the first equation of Eq. (18), yielding(84)(L-κpE)u(m)+(M-κpF)v(m)=βm-1,where(85)βm-1={(L-κpE)u(m)+(M-κpF)v(m)}-d(m-1)ds(m-1){(L-κpE)u′+(M-κpF)v′}.Combining (81)–(84), we obtain the linear system(86)EF-(n·Ru)-κ(b·Ru)FG-(n·Rv)-κ(b·Rv)(n·Ru)(n·Rv)-10L-κpEM-κpF00u(m)v(m)κ(m-2)τ(m-3)=-αm·Ru+Cmtt·Ru+C‾mnn·Ru+C‾mbb·Ru-αm·Rv+Cmtt·Rv+C‾mnn·Rv+C‾mbb·RvC‾mn-αm·nβm-1.Some engineering applications require locating the critical points ofκalong lines of curvature. We can compute such points by finding the parameter s such thatκ′(s)=0, which yields the following Newton’s iteration:(87)sk+1=sk-κ′(sk)κ″(sk),where the subscript k denotes the kth iteration. The Runge–Kutta method generates a sequence of parameter valuessi,i=0,1,…, which yields an ordered set of points along the lines of curvature. In general, the updated parameter valuesk+1from Newton’s method will not coincide withsi,i=0,1,…. Suppose thatsi<sk+1<si+1, thenκ′(sk)andκ″(sk+1)are interpolated fromκ′(si)andκ′(si+1), andκ″(si)andκ″(si+1), respectively. The critical points forτcan be obtained similarly.As an example,we compute critical points of curvature along a line of curvature of a plate surface that is located in the vicinity of the bulbous bow of a tanker. The details of this plate are given in Section 5.3. There are four critical points of curvature along the line of curvature as shown in Fig. 2(a), which coincides with the graph of arc-length versusκ′shown in Fig. 2(b). The parameter values of the critical points of the curvature along the line of curvature s and (u,v) are tabulated in Table 1.

We introduced algorithms to compute the differential geometry properties of the orthogonal net of lines of curvature of parametric surfaces, including curvature vector, binormal vector, and torsion, and also evaluated their higher-order derivatives. We confirmed the effectiveness of our algorithms by applying our techniques to doubly curved plates used in shipbuilding and architectural freeform design. There are several possibilities for the extension of our algorithm, a few of which are listed as follows:•We plan to apply our technique to real plate bending in shipbuilding.We plan to conduct research on heat path planning.
