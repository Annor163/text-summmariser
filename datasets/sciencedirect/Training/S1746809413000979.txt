@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The qualitative definition of repolarization alternans (RA) as an every-other-beat alternation of the repolarization amplitude allows several possible quantitative characterizations of RA. In the absence of a standardization, any correct comparison among quantitative outputs by different automatic methods requires knowledge of the differences in the RA parameterization at the basis of their algorithms. Thus, aim of the present study was to investigate the kind of information provided by five methods, namely the fast Fourier spectral method (FFTSM), the complex demodulation method (CDM), the modified moving average method (MMAM), the Laplacian likelihood ratio method (LLRM) and the heart-rate adaptive match filter method (AMFM) when characterizing RA in terms of its amplitude and location. Eight synthetic ECG recordings affected by stationary RA with uniform and triangular profiles localized along the ST segment, over the T wave, at the end of the T wave and all along the JT segment, respectively, were considered. Results indicate that quantitative RA characterization is method dependent. More specifically, the FFTSM and the LLRM provide a measure that matches the root mean square of the RA profile over the JT segment. Instead, the CDM and the AMFM compute RA amplitude as the mean value of the RA profile over the JT segment. Eventually, the MMAM provides the maximum amplitude difference between consecutive beats along repolarization. RA location is homogeneously among methods, since they all provide the time instant in correspondence of which the center of mass of the alternation occurs.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Repolarization alternans (RA) is an electrophysiologic phenomenon which, on the electrocardiogram (ECG), manifests itself as a beat-to-beat alternation of the ST segment and/or T wave amplitude or morphology. Macroscopic (i.e. visible to the naked eye) RA, first observed by Hearing in 1908 [1], is a quite rare phenomenon which has been associated to malignant ventricular arrhythmias [2,3]. After Adam et al. [4] reported the existence of microvolt RA, too small in amplitude to be visually detected at standard display scales, several methods have been proposed for its automatic detection and quantification [5–10]. Eventually, microvolt RA was recognized as one of the most promising non invasive indexes of risk of electrical instability [11–15] and sudden cardiac death [16–22].The first proposed method for automatic RA identification is the fast Fourier transform spectral method (FFTSM), designed by Smith et al. [5] in 1988 and slightly modified by Rosenbaum et al. [11] in 1994. The FFTSM, together with the time-domain modified moving-average method (MMAM) proposed by Nearing and Verrier [8], represent the most used techniques in clinical settings since they are both implemented in commercial machines (the FFTSM is implemented in the CH2000 and Heartwave, Cambridge Heart Inc., Bedford, MA, whereas the MMAM is implemented in the CASE-8000, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). Other popular techniques present in the literature are the complex demodulation method (CDM), proposed by Nearing et al. [6], the Laplacian likelihood ratio method (LLRM), proposed by Martínez et al. [23], and the heart-rate adaptive match filter method (AMFM) proposed by Burattini et al. [9]. These five methods have been previously analyzed to investigate their reliability in the identification of stationary as well as non-stationary RA, eventually in the presence of noise and interferences affecting the ECG tracings [24,25]. In their clinical applications [4–25] they characterized RA in terms is of its amplitude (μV), whereas only occasionally they have been used to provide RA characterization in terms of RA location along the JT segment [10,26–30], in most cases measured as time delay from the R peak (ms).Quantitative characterization of RA is strongly method dependent [24,25,31]. Indeed, the qualitative RA definition provided above (i.e. RA consists in an every-other beat alternation of the ST and/or T-wave morphology or amplitude) makes difficult a direct quantitative comparison of RA measurements from the different identification methods, which would rather require a preliminary standardization of technical specifications for RA parametric characterization. In the absence of such technical standards, any correct comparison among quantitative outputs provided by different methods requires knowledge of the differences in the RA parameterization at the basis of their algorithms.Differences in RA quantitative information provided by the FFTSM, the MMAM, the CDM, the LLRM and our AMFM were analyzed in the present study making use of synthetic ECG tracings affected by stationary RA with triangular and uniform profiles [24,31] localized along the ST segment, over the T wave, late in the repolarization [29,30] and all along the JT segment.
