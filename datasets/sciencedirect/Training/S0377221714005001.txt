@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The stochastic variability measures the degree of uncertainty for random demand and/or price in various operations problems. Its ordering property under mean-preserving transformation allows us to study the impact of demand/price uncertainty on the optimal decisions and the associated objective values. Based on Chebyshevâ€™s algebraic inequality, we provide a general framework for stochastic variability ordering under any mean-preserving transformation that can be parameterized by a single scalar, and apply it to a broad class of specific transformations, including the widely used mean-preserving affine transformation, truncation, and capping. The application to mean-preserving affine transformation rectifies an incorrect proof of an important result in the inventory literature, which has gone unnoticed for more than two decades. The application to mean-preserving truncation addresses inventory strategies in decentralized supply chains, and the application to mean-preserving capping sheds light on using option contracts for procurement risk management.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the study of a variety of operations problems in the presence of uncertainties (including demand, purchase price, and/or lead-time uncertainties), it is often of great interest to assess the impact of the degree of randomness, also known as stochastic variability. However, this could be a challenging task without an easily tractable way of ordering randomness. A useful approach commonly used in the literature is to employ a mean-preserving transformation of the random variable, which not only factors out the effect of the mean, but also parameterizes the variability of the random variable by a single scalar.In this paper, we provide a general framework for stochastic variability ordering under any mean-preserving transformation that can be parameterized by a single scalar, and then apply it to a broad class of specific transformations, including the mean-preserving affine transformation, truncation, and capping. The application to mean-preserving affine transformation rectifies an incorrect proof of a fundamental result in Gerchak and Mossman (1992) that has gone unnoticed for more than two decades. The application to mean-preserving truncation addresses inventory strategies in decentralized supply chains, and the application to mean-preserving capping sheds light on using option contracts for procurement risk management.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature. Section 3 provides a general framework for stochastic variability ordering under mean-preserving transformations, which is our main technical results. Section 4 discusses in great detail three different applications of our general framework. The paper concludes in Section 5.
