@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The current research classified 82 vehicle icons into seven categories (image-related, concept-related, semi-abstract, arbitrary, abbreviation, word, and combined) for their matching accuracy, matching sequence, and matching time. These data can be compared and used as a framework for future icon development. Forty participants, all with a university degree, took part in this experiment. Half of the participants had intensive driving experience, while the other half never driven a car. The results indicated that on average, word icons had a significantly greater matching accuracy than the other icon formats; ranging from 4.7 to 20.8% difference. Regarding the matching sequence, participants matched image-related icons before other icon formats. Arbitrary and combined icons took significantly longer to match than other icon formats by 1.4–6.2 s. Based on the high matching accuracy (86.3%) and high ratings on subjective design features, word format can be used for functions describable using simple English for users with English reading ability. Confusion matrices showed that 63.2% of the misunderstandings were caused by similarity in format or function.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With the increase in the number of functions in the driving environment, icons that are compact and international (language) (Horton, 1994) are often used in a vehicle to convey information to the driver (Green, 1993). Effective icons can provide the driver with a quick and complete understanding of the information to ensure driver safety (Baber and Wankling, 1992). But designing comprehensible icons is not a simple task. Saunby et al. (1988) showed that only 16 of 25 car icons tested could be matched correctly by a minimum 75% of experimental participants.An icon may be comprised of border, background, symbol (consisting of graphical elements), and textual labels (Fig. 1) (Campbell et al., 2004b; Horton, 1994) although not all of these components must be present. Each icon component can add meaning to an icon in its own way. Borders can make icons appear more consistent; background can help to group icons; and graphical and textual elements convey the main meaning of the icon (Carney et al., 1998).As indicated by Wang et al. (2007), icon taxonomy can fulfill a variety of functions including classifying icons into different types to evaluate the effectiveness of each type to be used as a framework for the future development of icons. Most icon taxonomy systems were developed to classify graphical icons according to how abstract or concrete they are (Wang et al., 2007). For example, graphical icons can be classified into image-related (pictorial), concept-related (analogy), or arbitrary based on how far the graphical elements in an icon (Fig. 1) resemble their referents (Goonetilleke et al., 2001; Lodding, 1983). Image-related icons are typical pictorial representations of the object or action. Concept-related icons attempt to visualize a concept that is not far but separate from the concrete image. Arbitrary icons have no obvious reference to their intended meaning, but become meaningful only through convention and education (Goonetilleke et al., 2001; Lodding, 1983). However, according to Blattner et al. (1989), semi-abstract icons combine an image-related (representational) pictorial element with an abstract (concept-related or arbitrary) symbol. For example, a folder with an arrow that indicates placing items in it. Similar semi-abstract icons can be found in cars, for examplefor rear window demisting and defrosting, the square depicts the rear window while the wavy arrow lines symbolize hot air flow. Besides graphical icons, two more categories can be added if incorporating textual elements into the icons: textual and combined (Reder and Mccallum, 2004). Textual icons can be further divided based on whether they contain words or abbreviations. Therefore, all icons can be classified into seven categories (image-related, concept-related, semi-abstract, arbitrary, word, abbreviation, and combined) presented in a tree-shaped diagram (Chi et al., 2012) (see Fig. 2).Prior research has compared the advantages of each icon format. The general conclusion is that recognition of graphical images has been found to be superior than that of text for recall and recognition accuracy (Paivio, 1971; Shepard, 1967), while text has been better for reaction time (Dewar et al., 1976). For graphical icons, image-related icons are easy to interpret because they have an obvious mapping between icon and the referent, thus image-related icons were considered the most effective for fast and accurate recognition (Blankenberger and Hahn, 1991; Wiedenbeck, 1999; Stotts, 1998). Other graphical icon formats, e.g. concept-related and arbitrary, have less obvious connections with the real world, and are therefore more difficult to interpret. Arbitrary icons should be avoided because educating people to associate arbitrary objects and their referents requires a considerable amount of funding and time (Horton, 1994). However, image-related (concrete) icons are less likely to provide any functional benefits for experienced users, even though they may be preferred (McDougall and Curry, 2004).The majority of above statements seem to suggest that image-related icons would be the most effective. However, if we review the commonly used ISO standard icons, we will find that not all of the icons are image-related because for some functions or contexts it is difficult or impossible to find a real object to represent the referent when creating image-related icons. Besides, most previous studies only compared three types of graphical icons (Wogalter et al., 2006) or graphical versus textual icons (Baber and Wankling, 1992; Wiedenbeck, 1999). Therefore, the current study categorized 82 existing icons within a newly built vehicle into seven different icon formats and compared the comprehension performance of the participants as they responded to each of the different formats.Eighty-two icons were classified into seven major categories based on Lodding (1983), Goonetilleke et al. (2001), and Blattner et al. (1989). Previously, before the introduction of the semi-abstract category, there were inconsistencies and confusions in classifying icons that had a representational pictorial element with an abstract symbol, i.e., air flow control () and recirculated air (). Most of these confusions were between image-related and concept-related; or among image-related, concept-related, and arbitrary, which could be resolved by categorizing them into the semi-abstract category. Besides, there was some confusion about classifying the car key reminder indicator (), as either image-related or concept-related, because of its poor image quality. Since image quality was not an attribute for the classification of each icon format () was classified as image-related.Since subjective rating scales are easy to administer, at times they can be more sensitive than objective measurements (Chi and Lin, 1998). Therefore, these 82 icons were also evaluated based on some subjective design features (McDougall and Reppa, 2008) such as familiarity, concreteness, visual complexity, and semantic distance. Each will be defined as in Table 1. The subjective rating features can help to explain why some icons could be better recognized than others (Liu and Ho, 2012).Among the seven differential icon formats, all four subjective design features (familiarity, concreteness, complexity, and semantic distance) can be used to evaluate image-related, concept-related, semi-abstract, arbitrary, and combined icons. However, for word and abbreviation formats, besides semantic distance, participants were also asked about whether they understood the meaning of the word or abbreviation in an icon. One small flaw in the evaluation of subjective design features is that the text meaning of the combined icons was not measured.The education level (university education versus without) (Ng and Chan, 2007) and experience (Goonetilleke et al., 2001; Isherwood et al., 2007) of the respondents were found to have significant effects on comprehension. Our experiment chose to test participants with at least a university-level education and divided their driving experience into having no driving experience and having intensive driving experience. Driving can be seen as a form of training that can increase icon recognition significantly (Goonetilleke et al., 2001). The current experiment measured icon recognition using novice drivers and experienced drivers to derive the proper baseline performance and evaluate the beneficial effect of experience on recognizing the different icon formats.In evaluating the comprehensibility of symbols, Wolff and Wogalter (1998) recommend using appropriate context showing the environment in which the symbol will likely be placed. Eighty-two icons copied from the steering wheel, center stack, and dashboard of a newly built vehicle would be presented on three task screens, respectively. Each task screen deals with maneuvering the vehicle, setting turning signals and activating the windshield wipers to increase driving safety, and serving the entertainment and information functions (Geiser, 1985; Tonnis et al., 2006). Icons in other locations, e.g. hood, trunk, and gas tank; were not included because it takes tremendous time to build each context and findings from the current three task screens can be generalized to icons in other contexts. Besides providing appropriate context, Wolff and Wogalter (1998) and SAE J2830 published by SAE International (2008) also recommended the use of an open-ended test. Since the scoring of open-ended responses is subjective and difficult, and mean comprehension on multiple-choice test with plausible distractors was not significantly different from the result generated from the open-ended test (Wolff and Wogalter, 1998), the current study choose to use a matching test (similar to multiple-choice test with plausible distractors) because it is an easy and reliable quantification of comprehension performance.Participants will match each icon with the most appropriate referent name. The referent names were copied from the owner's manual. A possible flaw in our matching task is that for some of the (new) referent functions, the image is a good choice to represent the underlying function, but the referent name was poorly chosen. The subjective design features would be rated for each icon after the matching test. These 82 icons would be categorized into seven different formats (i.e., image-related, concept-related, semi-abstract, arbitrary, word, abbreviation, and combined) to compare the matching accuracy, time, and sequence produced by the participants. The results obtained for the different icon formats on these performance measures can be used to perfect ISO standard 2575 published by the International Organization of Standardization (2010) to facilitate the design of new icons for new contexts or applications.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This study evaluated 82 vehicle icons in seven icon formats (image-related, concept-related, semi-abstract, arbitrary, word, abbreviation, and combined) with two groups of participants, with and without driving experience. The results indicated that driving experience had a significant effect on matching accuracy, while the matching sequence was affected by the icon format. All participants chose to match image-related icons before other icon formats. Incorporation of new icons (functions) should be carefully reviewed at the system design stage and be restrained to minimize the visual and information processing load for the driver. Campbell et al. (2004b) suggested a general development process for icons be used in all vehicles. The guidelines identify which in-vehicle messages required an icon. Since the matching performance of ISO icons was always better than that of the non-ISO for all participants, the icon designer should consult the relevant standards to check if a standard icon exists and follow the (ISO) standards whenever possible. In cases where no standard icon is available, the designer needs to use production tests to generate ideas for icons, identify candidate icons for further testing, then conduct appropriateness ranking tests to screen the candidate icons and select the best ones for further testing. To ensure candidate icons can be recognized properly, the designers can choose to conduct a recognition test on candidate icons with a representative group of participants or conduct a matching test on a complete set of icons. Based on the test results, redesigning the icons that have poor recognition performance or matching performance (e.g., fail to reach at least 85% or 67% correct) should be done. In the end, icons that are redesigned should go through a comprehension test or matching test to ensure proper recognition performance.
