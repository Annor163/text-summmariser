Pleasant music as a countermeasure against visually induced motion sickness

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Music as a countermeasure against visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) was tested.Different music types (relaxing, neutral, stressful, or no music) were chosen.Relaxing music showed a non-significant trend to reduce VIMS.Music rated as pleasant significantly reduced the severity of VIMS.Pleasant music could act as an effective and low-cost countermeasure against VIMS.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) is a well-known side-effect in virtual environments or simulators. However, effective behavioral countermeasures against VIMS are still sparse. In this study, we tested whether music can reduce the severity of VIMS. Ninety-three volunteers were immersed in an approximately 14-minute-long video taken during a bicycle ride. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups, either including relaxing music, neutral music, stressful music, or no music. Sickness scores were collected using the Fast Motion Sickness Scale and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. Results showed an overall trend for relaxing music to reduce the severity of VIMS. When factoring in the subjective pleasantness of the music, a significant reduction of VIMS occurred only when the presented music was perceived as pleasant, regardless of the music type. In addition, we found a gender effect with women reporting more sickness than men. We assume that the presentation of pleasant music can be an effective, low-cost, and easy-to-administer method to reduce VIMS.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Motion sickness is a well-known phenomenon not only when traveling, but also in virtual environments. In the latter case, motion sickness typically occurs in the absence of real physical motion, thus, motion sickness in simulators, cinemas, video-games, or virtual reality is usually referred to as being visually induced. Typical symptoms during an acute phase of visually induced motion sickness11Visually induced motion sickness, VIMS.include, but are not limited to, pallor, cold sweat, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue, or nausea.The genesis of VIMS is not fully understood. Arguably the most prominent explanation for VIMS is described by the sensory conflict theory (Reason, 1978; Oman, 1990). Following this approach, a mismatch between or within the visual, vestibular, and/or the proprioceptive system is the origin of VIMS. For instance, users of fixed-base driving or flight simulators frequently experience the illusion of self-motion—so-called vection (see Hettinger, 2002; for an overview)—although they remain physically unmoved. Thus, the signals delivered by the visual system (indicating vection) and the vestibular organs (indicating the observer's veridical, stationary position) are at variance with each other. If this visual-vestibular mismatch is unfamiliar to the user VIMS might occur as a potential side-effect. Note that for good reasons, the sensory conflict theory has been discussed controversially over the past years. Alternative approaches include the sensed vertical hypothesis (Bles et al., 1998), the postural instability hypothesis (Riccio and Stoffregen, 1991), or the eye-movement theory (Ebenholtz, 1992). Unfortunately, none of these theories is capable of explaining all nuances of the multi-faceted nature of VIMS, hence, the precise genesis of VIMS still remains ambiguous.Despite the lack of a profound theory, several countermeasures against motion sickness and VIMS do exist. A variety of drugs have been tested over the past years (for an overview see Sherman, 2002; Shupak and Gordon, 2006), and two drug classes have gained special popularity, namely antihistamines and anticholinergics (Hoyt et al., 2009). Antihistamines (e.g. meclozine, cyclizine, or promethazine) are designed to inhibit histaminergic H-receptors and might affect the H1-receptors in the vestibular nuclei (Golding, 2006). In contrast, the purpose of anticholinergic substances is to block muscarinic receptors in the brain and to subdue the input from the vestibular organs to the vestibular nuclei. Currently, scopolamine is probably the most common anticholinergic medication used against motion sickness (Murray, 1997; Sherman, 2002). Although medical drugs can reliably reduce motion sickness, serious temporary side-effects – such as drowsiness, fatigue, or cognitive impairment – frequently occur and pose a serious limit to the application of anti-motion sickness drugs. Note that most drugs have been designed to ease classical, travel-related motion sickness. It remains uncertain whether such drugs can also be assessed to successfully diminish VIMS. For instance, Furman and Marcus (2009) showed that rizatriptan—a tryptamine-based drug used to treat migraine—can reduce classical motion sickness but is less effective in preventing VIMS.Additionally, several behavioral techniques have been introduced in the past to counteract both motion sickness and VIMS. The most efficient method to prevent VIMS is adaptation or habituation, respectively. VIMS typically subsides in most people with repeated exposure to the same nauseating stimuli (Cowings and Toscano, 2000; Young et al., 2003; Cheung and Hofer, 2005). Although some behavioral techniques have delivered promising results, they come at a price or may be impractical in many situations. For instance, adaptation to VIMS is very time-consuming and cost-intensive, hence, it is not the method of choice in many cases.Yen Pik Sang et al. (2003a) highlighted the role of music as a potential countermeasure against classical motion sickness that does not have the disadvantages outlined above. The authors asked their participants to perform head movements in off-vertical directions during full-body rotation along the earth-vertical yaw-axis. This procedure typically causes Coriolis effects and is known to be highly nauseating. Relaxing background music turned out to significantly prolong the onset time of motion sickness compared to a control group that did not listen to music. However, several questions were left unanswered. The authors used physical movement to create motion sickness, but did not focus on VIMS. Also, the music was only introduced after the onset of sickness symptoms. This could have been later than optimal, as motion sickness can rapidly increase once the first signs appear. Furthermore, the authors analyzed the onset delay of MS rather than its magnitude. Finally, the effect of several types of music and the relation between the music's pleasantness and its effect on VIMS has not been addressed.Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness of different music types as suitable countermeasures against VIMS. We exposed our participants to a nauseating video of a bicycle ride and either added relaxing (instrumental music), neutral (mainstream pop music), or stressful music (fast speed electronic music). A control group received no music. We assumed that relaxing music would effectively reduce the severity of VIMS compared to stressful or no music. Additionally, gender was added as further factor as previous research showed higher VIMS-reports for women compared to men (Flanagan et al., 2005; Klosterhalfen et al., 2005).
