@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Manufacturers of interactive medical devices, such as infusion pumps, need to ensure that devices minimise the risk of unintended harm during use. However, development teams face challenges in incorporating Human Factors. The aim of the research reported here was to better understand the constraints under which medical device design and development take place. We report the results of a qualitative study based on 19 semi-structured interviews with professionals involved in the design, development and deployment of interactive medical devices. A thematic analysis was conducted. Multiple barriers to designing for safety and usability were identified. In particular, we identified barriers to communication both between the development organisation and the intended users and between different teams within the development organisation. We propose the use of mediating representations. Artefacts such as personas and scenarios, known to provide integration across multiple perspectives, are an essential component of designing for safety and usability.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Design can reduce the likelihood and consequences of error (Clarkson et al., 2004). Developing a system wide understanding of users, the tools that they use and the environments in which the live and work supports this approach (Carayon et al., 2006). For medical devices, such as infusion pumps, there are several examples of redesign that would reduce error rates (Lin et al., 1998; Thimbleby and Cairns, 2010). In these cases a valuable opportunity has been missed: once equipment has been deployed, it is difficult to update or modify it. There have been calls for an acceleration of the integration of Human Factors and ergonomics in patient safety, including the creation of “market forces for manufacturers to produce safer products that incorporate HFE [Human Factors Engineering] principles and techniques” (Gurses et al., 2012). HFE is a term applied to the application of theory, principles, data and methods to design in order to optimise human well-being and overall system performance. The European equivalent is Usability Engineering (UE), which is similar in principle. The aim of the work reported here is to better understand current practices in incorporating HFE into the design and development of interactive medical devices and, in particular, the challenges to doing so.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this study, 19 interviews were conducted across a range of individuals involved in the design and development of medical equipment. We found there was a lack of common ground between disciplines, meaning that communication was impeded by gaps in mutual understanding or shared reference points. It was as if the range of stakeholders internal and external to the development process were residing within disciplinary silos or walled gardens. This had the effect of blocking exchanges relating to UE/HFE. Interaction design tools and techniques were being applied as interpreted by a given community, the results packaged up and, metaphorically speaking, lobbed over the walls. This was for use by others involved in development. When these packages were received it was often the case that the recipient had little or no use for the contents. We observed this in terms of overlapping or unclear UE/HFE roles and responsibilities, different interpretations of UE/HFE activities and a poor understanding of the needs and objectives of others.Given the abundance of guidance and support for UE/HFE, and the need to work together, why was multidisciplinary communication so poor? Studies in other industries have shown that when information is passed across multiple organisational levels, intermediaries can distort the technical picture or omit critical data. Information can be oversimplified and assumptions communicated inadequately. There are personal or professional aspects that modulate the degree to which those from different backgrounds communicate effectively (Eckert et al., 2001). We saw this in a reluctance to consult with certain user groups, conflicts between UE/HFE practitioners and safety/marketing professionals, stereotypes regarding the role of UE/HFE and documentation not making its way to the intended recipient. We would have liked to measure the number of organisational levels, or the chain of communication that occurred, to get a more detailed account of where information was lost, distorted, detached or delayed; however, this remains a topic for future investigation.In summary, we have conducted a broad study, consulting across medical device manufacturers in several countries, using an exemplar class of device as a way of providing focus. There were limits to the extent to which UE/HFE techniques could be applied effectively. We recommend the use of mediating representations or boundary objects to support effective communication. Without addressing barriers to communication, it is unlikely that the implementation of UE/HFE will realise essential benefits relating to safety and usability.None.This work is part of the CHI+MED: Multidisciplinary Computer-Human Interaction research for the design and safe use of interactive medical devices project, supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G059063/1].
