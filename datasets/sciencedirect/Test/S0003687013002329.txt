Paramedics on the job: Dynamic trunk motion assessment at the workplace

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Postural load of paramedics on the job was examined using direct field measurements.The highest trunk angles in the three planes were observed during lifting activities.Peak velocities of the trunk were observed during ambulance transport.Increased trunk motion exposure was observed in urgent and high-demand situations.Paramedics adopted trunk motions that may increase the risk of low back disorders.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Many paramedics' work accidents are related to physical aspects of the job, and the most affected body part is the low back. This study documents the trunk motion exposure of paramedics on the job. Nine paramedics were observed over 12 shifts (120h). Trunk postures were recorded with the computer-assisted CUELA measurement system worn on the back like a knapsack. Average duration of an emergency call was 23.5min. Sagittal trunk flexion of >40° and twisting rotation of >24° were observed in 21% and 17% of time-sampled postures. Medical care on the scene (44% of total time) involved prolonged flexed and twisted postures (∼10s). The highest extreme sagittal trunk flexion (63°) and twisting rotation (40°) were observed during lifting activities, which lasted 2% of the total time. Paramedics adopted trunk motions that may significantly increase the risk of low back disorders during medical care and patient-handling activities.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A paramedic's job can be described as evaluating and stabilizing patients' condition before the patients receive medical attention at the hospital. Among healthcare workers and the general population, paramedics have the highest percentage of early retirement, most often due to musculoskeletal disorders (Hogya and Ellis, 1990; Pattani et al., 2001; Rodgers, 1998; Sterud et al., 2006, 2008). More than 63% of paramedics' work accidents result from overexertion (push, pull, raise, hold, etc.) or bodily reaction (reach, lean, slip, climb, stumble, etc.) (CSST, 2012). Many studies have demonstrated that low back disorders are a common health problem among paramedics (Crill and Hostler, 2005; Hogya and Ellis, 1990; Jones and Lee, 2005; Studnek et al., 2010). One factor, or a combination of several, may underlie these low back disorders (Corbeil and Prairie, 2012). For instance, plausible explanations include the physical demands of the job (Aasa et al., 2005; Barnekow-Bergkvist et al., 2004; Putz-Anderson et al., 1997) and the execution of tasks in awkward postures (Doormaal et al., 1995).Most studies have analyzed paramedics' work using questionnaires (Jones and Lee, 2005), interviews (Hignett et al., 2007) or simulations in the laboratory (Aasa et al., 2008; Barnekow-Bergkvist et al., 2004; Lavender et al., 2000a,b), but, given the wide variety of scenarios and work strategies, these studies did not allow for a complete representation of the situation. We found only two studies (Doormaal et al., 1995; Ferreira and Stanley, 2005) that analyzed paramedics' posture on the job. Both studies used the Ovako working posture analysis system (OWAS method) (Karhu et al., 1977, 1981) to describe the paramedics' general posture during a work shift (Doormaal et al., 1995) or during activities performed in an ambulance's patient compartment (Ferreira and Stanley, 2005). Doormaal et al. (1995) found that 16–29% of a work shift was spent in harmful positions and that strenuous situations occurred particularly often during emergency tasks.One limitation of the OWAS method is that information is obtained from a static posture analysis (“snapshot”) every 30s. Consequently, the physical constraints of the job are determined by the observation of only two pictures per minute and dynamic motion assessment is ignored. However, dynamic motion characteristics may play an important role in the development of low back disorders (Davis and Marras, 2000; Marras et al., 2010). New technologies permit the more accurate collection of information about postural risk factors of dynamic trunk motion by using direct measurements of paramedics' movements obtained during field observations (Ellegast and Kupfer, 1999; Marras et al., 2010; Plamondon et al., 2007).The aim of this study was to document the trunk motion exposure of paramedics on the job using continuous recordings of back posture (CUELA system) during work activities, from the arrival on the scene to the delivery of the patient to the hospital. We hypothesized that trunk motion exposure to risk factors for low back disorder was likely to be more significant when work duties were accomplished in urgent situations and also when the paramedic perceived the work duties as highly physically demanding, rather than not very physically demanding.
