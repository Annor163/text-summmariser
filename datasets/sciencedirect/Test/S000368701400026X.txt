We examined an interruption recovery tool to assist supervisors in C2 settings.The tool is an interactive timeline of historical events with discrete replay.Decisions were faster and more accurate with the interactive event timeline tool.The tool was particularly effective when participants faced complex decisions.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper investigates the effectiveness of providing interruption recovery assistance in the form of an interactive visual timeline of historical events on a peripheral display in support of team supervision in time-critical settings. As interruptions can have detrimental effects on task performance, particularly in time-critical work environments, there is growing interest in the design of tools to assist people in resuming their pre-interruption activity. A user study was conducted to evaluate the use of an interactive event timeline that provides assistance to human supervisors in time-critical settings. The study was conducted in an experimental platform that emulated a team of operators and a mission commander performing a time-critical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission. The study results showed that providing interruption assistance enabled people to recover from interruptions faster and more accurately. These results have implications for interface design that could be adopted in similar time-critical environments such as air-traffic control, process control, and first responders.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Interruptions, a common occurrence in modern workplaces, have been shown to have a wide variety of negative consequences (e.g., Jett and George, 2003). They can result in slower task completion time, increased error rates and additional job stress (e.g., Bailey and Konstan, 2006; Cellier and Eyrolle, 1992; Czerwinski et al., 2000; Van Bergen, 1968). Disruption of work in team-based activities can also lead to coordination problems, including increased time pressure and team member workload (Jett and George, 2003; Reder and Schwab, 1990). Interruptions can have particularly negative effects on personnel working in time-critical environments, such as command and control (C2) settings, as an interruption occurring in these high-risk, information-rich settings may cause personnel to miss critical information directly related to the decision-at-hand. Supervisors in modern work environments are particularly prone to interruptions in the form of “unexpected meetings and conversations” (Jett and George, 2003, p. 494) that interfere with their ongoing tasks (e.g., Mintzberg, 1990). In particular, supervisors in time-critical environments may be impacted by interruptions, especially given the highly collaborative and multitasking nature of these environments (Cooke et al., 2007; Cooke and Gorman, 2006). For example in C2 settings, supervisors not only monitor the mission and make decisions that involve tactical assessment, but are also in charge of monitoring the performance of other personnel. Detecting changes and maintaining situation awareness (SA) of an ongoing mission after an interruption in such complex monitoring tasks often imposes a high working memory load and requires mental calculation (Trafton et al., 2003). To date, however, little research has focused on interruption recovery support for supervisors in C2 settings. Providing such support may help supervisors more effectively resume their previous tasks, which often involves understanding the team's “mission picture” (or “big picture”), which may consequently benefit overall team functioning.Previous research has investigated operator-level interruption recovery in C2 settings (e.g., Scott et al., 2006; St. John et al., 2005), with a particular focus in assisting operators to “catch up” on changes that occurred in their dynamic task environment while they were attending to an interruption. This research builds on this approach by adapting operator-level interruption recovery methods to account for the informational needs of team supervisors in C2 environments. In particular, this research builds on Scott et al.’s (2006) use of interactive event timelines coupled with discrete event replay to enable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators to regain SA after interruptions. In that research, selecting an iconic event bookmark from an interactive event timeline caused the historical state of the tactical map to be displayed at the time of the event in a separate replay window. This paper extends that previous research by providing an interactive event timeline that highlights team-related events and activities to improve supervisor decision accuracy and timeliness after an interruption.To further set the context for this work, the paper overviews previous research in the area of time-critical interruption recovery. Next, a representative mission task scenario and experimental platform developed to evaluate the supervisory-level interactive event timeline design concept are introduced, along with the interruption recovery assistance (IRA) tool that reified the interactive event timeline interruption recovery method. A laboratory-based user study is then described that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this interruption recovery method on mitigating supervisory-level interruption recovery. Finally, the results of the experiment are detailed and discussed.
