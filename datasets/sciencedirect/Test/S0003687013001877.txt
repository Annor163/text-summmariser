Thermoregulatory modeling use and application in the military workforce

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
We modeled physiology of soldiers inside the military vehicle driving in dry heat.We developed a military working dog model from human models with dog functions.We modeled soldiers' heat tolerance that could differ >25% by body size and shape.Soldiers inside the military vehicle >35 °C need cooling to avoid heat illness.A resting military working dog can survive in a shaded dry environment to <40 °C.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Thermoregulatory models have been used in the military to quantify probabilities of individuals' thermal-related illness/injury. The uses of the models have diversified over the past decade. This paper revisits an overall view of selected thermoregulatory models used in the U.S. military and provides examples of actual practical military applications: 1) the latest military vehicle designed with armor and blast/bulletproof windows was assessed to predict crews' thermal strains levels inside vehicles under hot environment (air temperature [Ta]: 29–43 °C, dew point: 13 °C); 2) a military working dog (MWD) model was developed by modifying existing human thermoregulatory models with canine physical appearance and physiological mechanisms; 3) thermal tolerance range of individuals from a large military group (n = 100) exposed to 35 °C/40% relative humidity were examined using thermoregulatory modeling and multivariate statistical analyses. Model simulation results assist in the decisions for the strategic planning and preventions of heat stress.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Military operations are widely dispersed across the globe to areas such as Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Pacific regions, and throughout domestic and extended territories (Department of Defense, 2004; Nevola et al., 2010). One of the major challenges the military faces is sustainment of missions in diverse environment and operational situations. For instance, soldiers working in a battlefield often wear body armor and use vehicles (e.g., High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle [HMMWV], etc) in hot-dry weather (e.g., Iraq air temperature: ∼50 °C/dew point 13 °C). Under these extreme conditions, soldiers experience heat stress and are at inherently higher risk of thermal-related illnesses/injuries. Various strategies/guidelines have been developed to reduce the risk of heat illness for military personnel including early morning/late night patrols, the usage of personnel cooling systems, appropriate hydration, and heat acclimation prior to deployment (Department of the Army and Air Force, 2003; Epstein et al., 2012). However, methods are needed to quantify the effectiveness of these strategies in improving military personnel's ability to sustain their operations. An actual experimental method to replicate military working conditions can be ideal to verify if the strategies/guidelines are up-to-date (Nevola et al., 2004, 2010; Amos et al., 2000). However, this verification method can be costly and time-consuming and it is difficult to replicate or consider all possible military operational and environmental situations.Considering the above problem, human thermoregulatory models are being developed in the military. They variously predict physiological responses of military personnel and the probabilities of thermal-related illnesses/injuries, estimate safe thermal work times, and predict the time available for successful rescue (Berglund et al., 2006; Kraning and Gonzalez, 1997; Pandolf et al., 1986; Xu and Werner, 1997; Yokota et al., 2008). Thermoregulatory models, consisting of series of biophysical processes and physiological control equations rationally integrated to represent the human thermal physiological mechanisms, can provide simulations of human thermo-physiological responses to various combinations of environmental and operational conditions. These simulations can be conducted repeatedly and efficiently at low cost and without risk to human test volunteers. The various models enable and facilitate equipment, clothing and their design and mission planning to reduce heat illness related risks.Thermoregulatory models developed over the years include pioneering work (Gagge et al., 1986; Stolwijk and Hardy, 1966; Stolwijk, 1970; Werner and Buse, 1988; Wissler, 1964) and more modern successors including sophisticated models to represent detailed human body parts and models adaptable for different individuals exposed to various environments (Berglund et al., 2009; Fiala et al., 1999; Haslam and Parsons, 1987; Havenith, 2001; Li et al., 2008; Shitzer et al., 1997; Tanabe et al., 2002; Tikuisis et al., 1988; Xu et al., 2011; Yokoyama et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2001). However, utilization of these models to solve practical problems in working environments is infrequently reported. The purpose of this paper is to describe basic overviews of thermoregulatory models used by the US military together with examples of their usage and applications. The ultimate goal of the US military for utilizing thermoregulatory models is to prevent thermal-related illness/injury, promote occupational safety, sustain operations, and maximize the physical performance of military personnel.
