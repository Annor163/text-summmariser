Evaluation of two cooling systems under a firefighter coverall

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Two cooling systems were tested under a firefighter suit, exercising in the heat.The systems featured cooled pads or a cold water perfusion system.The cool pads initially improved thermal sensation, the perfused system continually.Neither system reduced core temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion or comfort.The tested cooling systems did not meet the cooling expectations.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Firemen often suffer from heat strain. This study investigated two chest cooling systems for use under a firefighting suit. In nine male subjects, a vest with water soaked cooling pads and a vest with water perfused tubes were compared to a control condition. Subjects performed 30 min walking and 10 min recovery in hot conditions, while physiological and perceptual parameters were measured. No differences were observed in heart rate and rectal temperature, but scapular skin temperature and fluid loss were lower using the perfused vest. Thermal sensation was cooler for the perfused vest than for the other conditions, while the cool pad vest felt initially cooler than control. However, comfort and RPE scores were similar. We conclude that the cooling effect of both tested systems, mainly providing a (temporally) cooler thermal sensation, was limited and did not meet the expectations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Firemen are often exposed to extreme heat. In combination with heavy physical exercise and protective equipment, this may lead to heat strain (Barr et al., 2010; Cheung et al., 2010). The concomitant reduction in cognitive and physical capacity compromises operational capability, endurance and safety (Galloway and Maughan, 1997; Hancock and Vasmatzidis, 2003; Hunter et al., 2002; MacDougall et al., 1974; Nielsen et al., 2001; Nybo, 2007). External cooling mechanisms could attenuate heat strain and counteract these adverse consequences.Most research has been performed on rapid cooling of the firefighter after his work or during short breaks (e.g. Barr et al., 2011; Carter et al., 1999; House et al., 1997; Selkirk et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2009). However, only a few studies investigated direct active cooling during work (e.g. House et al., 2013), which may be the most effective way of reducing heat strain. For firemen this implies the use of a portable cooling system worn under the personal protective clothing. Available cooling systems generally use cooling by air, liquid or phase change materials (PCM).In exercising athletes (Teunissen et al., 2013) as well as in pilots (Reffeltrath, 2006) and military forces (Barwood et al., 2009b), air cooling by blown ambient air has been shown to reduce heat strain, increase performance and improve comfort. However, firemen often work in contaminated environments, while sufficient air filtering is difficult. An attempt to feed the exhaust gases from the breathing apparatus back into the suit to enhance evaporative cooling, was not effective (Williams et al., 2011). Possibly, the air layer between clothing and skin is rapidly saturated, limiting the effect of (ambient) air cooling. Cooled air systems may be more effective, but are usually rather complex and heavy.A PCM cooling vest contains a solid substance which absorbs heat while changing to a liquid state. Ice vests are a well-known example. In practice, PCM is often the most usable cooling technique because of its simple mechanism and unpowered nature. Its use under protective clothing can decrease heat strain (Bennett et al., 1995; Cadarette et al., 2002; Chou et al., 2008; House et al., 2003) and increase time to exhaustion (Kenny et al., 2011). Nevertheless, not all studies found positive effects (Carter et al., 2007). It is possible that a PCM vest impairs sweat evaporation from the body and does not provide a positive contribution to the heat balance (Gao et al., 2011).From the perspective of maximum heat removal, liquid cooling by tubed garments is probably the most effective cooling technique. In general, a tubed vest filled with circulating cold water or glycol provides direct conductive cooling, extracting up to 170 W under optimal conditions (Frim et al., 1996). However, the system requires a pump, heat exchanger, and power supply. It is possible that the significant bulk, weight, and power dependence of these systems restrict its mobility and offset its benefits (McLellan et al., 2013).It is still a challenge to develop optimal cooling systems for use during operational tasks. Previous studies on this topic have mostly focused on physiological measures and performance. Perceptual measures like thermal sensation and thermal comfort have been described less frequently, but may affect the initial selection of exercise intensity (Schlader et al., 2011b) and control thermoregulatory behavior (Schlader et al., 2011a). Perception is not always in line with performance. Daanen et al. (2013) recently showed that people feel fatigued after sleep deprivation but this has no impact on performance. In contrast, work in the heat showed a decrement in performance while people assessed that they can do the job easily. A discrepancy between perception and performance may lead to overestimation or underestimation of the risks and thus to injury. Therefore, the inclusion of perceptual measures is important for gaining knowledge on the interaction of perceptual, physiological and performance measures, as well as for the successful implementation of a cooling system.The current study investigated two chest cooling systems for use under fire protective garments. The first newly developed cooling vest uses pads which have been soaked in cold water, providing conductive cooling without the need for ice, pump or power. This resulted in a very light-weight mobile vest, which may slightly limit evaporative efficiency (Gao et al., 2011). The second cooling vest is a more traditional tubed liquid cooling system with cold perfusing water, using ice bottles in a small backpack for heat exchange. The compact configuration limits the weight and power requirements, but the aforementioned disadvantages regarding vasoconstriction and evaporative impairment still remain. Both systems were worn under a firefighting coverall and compared to a control condition during 30 min treadmill walking and 10 min recovery in hot conditions. Both physiological and perceptual parameters were investigated.
