@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Researchers have pointed out that people with physical disabilities find it difficult to obtain suitable clothing. In this study a set of wheelchair user oriented functional clothing was designed. Attention was paid to the wheelchair users' daily living activities related with clothing. An evaluating system combined with sports tournament and rehabilitation medicine was introduced to assess the new designed clothing. Six wheelchair users (3 males and 3 females) were invited to wear the clothing. A set of normal functional clothing was employed as a comparison (Control). The time required to complete three different daily living activities, i.e. dressing and undressing, going to toilet and bathing were recorded. Results showed that with the new clothing wheelchair users' competence of managing toilet was increased by 52.9%. The time needed for toilet was reduced by 45.7%. Their capability of managing dressing and undressing was improved by 24.6%. The study indicated that the newly designed clothing could facilitate wheelchair users' daily living activities related with clothing.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
People with physical disabilities either due to chronic sickness or aging or some other reasons have to spend a large part of time in a seated posture or confined to wheelchairs (Ng et al., 2011). Due to their physical difference with the non-disabled, the physical access issue and the lack of available transport, their participation in daily activity and communication is usually obstructed (Chang et al., 2009; Reid et al., 2001). Even the daily living activities, such as dressing and undressing, are difficult for the disabled and are required to seek the help of others (Kumar, 1997). For those stroke survivors who use wheelchairs, dressing and bathing are the most common self-care problems for them (Reid et al., 2001).Some researchers have pointed out that people with physical disabilities find it difficult for them to obtain suitable clothing (Thoren, 1997; Chang et al., 2009). Their clothing needs individual adaption. The reason, as is accounted for by Thoren (1997), is that most of the disabled do not fit into the current size system, i.e. their body dimensions differ from those represented in the size system. For the disabled people, anatomical changes will occur, such as their spines curve forward (Ng et al., 2011) and their body heights decrease (Civitci, 2004), either due to the long-time seated posture or aging (a big proportion of disabled people, especially the wheelchair users are the elderly). Also previous studies have compared the anthropometric characteristics of the disabled with the able-bodied and have found the difference between these two groups (Goswami et al., 1987; Lucero-Duarte et al., 2012; Das and Kozey, 1999).For the disabled people appropriately dressed individuals had bigger chance at job acquisition than those inappropriately dressed persons (Christman and Branson, 1990). Another study has indicated that the redesign of wheelchair users' clothing can help reduce the physical strain and work load of their personal helpers (Nevala et al., 2003). Therefore, it is meaningful and beneficial to design disabled people oriented clothing to meet their physical demand, as well as psychological demand.In this study, a set of new functional clothing for the wheelchair users were designed. Much attention was paid to their daily living activities, i.e. dressing and undressing, going to toilet and bathing. An evaluating system deriving from rehabilitation medicine and sports tournament was introduced to assess the new functional clothing. It was hypothesized that the newly designed clothing could facilitate the wheelchair users' daily living activities.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A set of functional clothing for the wheelchair users was designed. The newly designed clothing was given much consideration to the wheelchair users' daily living activities. An evaluating system deriving from the rehabilitation medicine and the sports tournament was described and used for assessing the new functional clothing.Taking off and putting on the crotch were rated as the most difficult movements by the wheelchair uses. However, with the new functional clothing wheelchair users' competence of managing toilet was promoted by 52.9%. Their competence of managing dressing and undressing was improved by 24.6%. The time required for toilet was reduced by 45.7%. Subject wear trials indicated that the new functional clothing was warmer and more comfortable to wear than the normal functional clothing for the wheelchair users. Skin wetness sensation was higher, which might lead to health problems of skin ulceration or infection. In a word, the new functional clothing could facilitate wheelchair users daily living activities related with clothing.
