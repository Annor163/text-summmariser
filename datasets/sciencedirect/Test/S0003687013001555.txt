@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Huge areas of work are still done manually and require the usages of different powered and non-powered hand tools. In order to increase the user performance, satisfaction, and lower the risk of acute and cumulative trauma disorders, several researchers have investigated the sizes and shapes of tool-handles. However, only a few authors have investigated tool-handles' materials for further optimising them. Therefore, as presented in this paper, we have utilised a finite-element method for simulating human fingertip whilst grasping tool-handles. We modelled and simulated steel and ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber as homogeneous tool-handle materials and two composites consisting of EPDM rubber and EPDM foam, and also EPDM rubber and PU foam. The simulated finger force was set to obtain characteristic contact pressures of 20 kPa, 40 kPa, 80 kPa, and 100 kPa. Numerical tests have shown that EPDM rubber lowers the contact pressure just slightly. On the other hand, both composites showed significant reduction in contact pressure that could lower the risks of acute and cumulative trauma disorders which are pressure-dependent. Based on the results, it is also evident that a composite containing PU foam with a more evident and flat plateau deformed less at lower strain rates and deformed more when the plateau was reached, in comparison to the composite with EPDM foam. It was shown that hyper-elastic foam materials, which take into account the non-linear behaviour of fingertip soft tissue, can lower the contact pressure whilst maintaining low deformation rate of the tool-handle material for maintaining sufficient rate of stability of the hand tool in the hands. Lower contact pressure also lowers the risk of acute and cumulative trauma disorders, and increases comfort whilst maintaining performance.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A significant part of manual work is still done using hand-tools, therefore a correct design is crucial for preventing upper extremity acute trauma disorders (ATD) and cumulative trauma disorders (CTD), such as blisters, carpal tunnel syndrome, hand-arm vibration syndrome, tendonitis, etc (Moore et al., 1991). When considering the ergonomics of the hand-tool, besides its main functionality, the most important aspect is the tool's handle. It has been shown, that a correctly designed handle can provide safety, comfort, and increased performance (Eksioglu, 2004). The broad variety of powered and non-powered hand-tools seems to have blunted the desires of many authors to research the topic of tool-handle design. They have provided guidelines and mathematical models for determining the sizes and shapes of the handles in order to maximize finger-force exertion, comfort, contact area, thus minimizing the chanced of ATD and CTD (Garneau and Parkinson, 2011; Kong and Lowe, 2005; Oh and Radwin, 1993; Seo and Armstrong, 2008). It has been shown that ATD and CTD, which are caused by badly designed hand-tools, account for about one third of workers' sick leaves, resulting in workers' compensations claims (Punnett and Wegman, 2004; Tanaka et al., 1997, 1995).Several researchers have paid a lot of attention to hand-tools in terms of perceived discomfort/comfort, since it is strongly correlated with user performance (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2007). Comfort is affected by physical, physiological, and psychological factors, and is subjectively defined by feelings, which differs from subject to subject (De Looze et al., 2003). Therefore designers have to optimize the human/product interaction in order to reduce the discomfort (Kuijt-Evers et al., 2004). The feeling of discomfort whilst using a hand-tool can reduce the efficiency of the task, and user's satisfaction. The reduction of discomfort is mainly possible by optimising the functionality of the hand-tool, and the physical interaction between the hand and the handle. It has been also shown that great correlation exists between physical and psychophysical properties of the materials which are in touch by the users (Wongsriruksa et al., 2012).Most authors have focused on the sizes and the shapes of the tool-handles, but neglected those materials of the handles that are in direct contact with the user's hand. It has been shown that successful choice of product material is critical for success of the whole product on the market (Ljungberg and Edwards, 2003). Authors provided basic guidelines regarding the material choice, but did not investigate and consider the mechanical behaviour of the skin and soft tissue whilst grasping handles of different materials.Skin and subcutaneous tissue are highly complex structures, therefore their material properties are hard to measure and define. The mechanical properties of skin and subcutaneous tissue have been extensively investigated by many researchers (Clark et al., 1996; Edwards and Marks, 1995; Pan et al., 1998; Wan Abas, 1994; Wilhelmi et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2007a; Zheng and Mak, 1996). It has been shown, that skin and subcutaneous tissue have non-linear viscoelastic properties, where the skin is stiffer than the subcutaneous tissue. Both have low stiffness regions at small strains followed by a substantial increase in the stiffness when the strain increases. Brand and Hollisters' (1999) rough guidelines are provided for the maximum suggested pressure versus time application over bony prominences. The recommended guidelines are for designing medical splints, but can also be used for designing and analysing hand-tools. It has been shown that higher contact pressures than allowed for a specific time can result in discomfort, pain, and ischemia which can lead to ATD and CTD. A power grasp can yield a contact pressure of the fingertip of 80 kPa or over, which is excessive loading for skin and subcutaneous tissue (Gurram et al., 1995). It has been shown that hand-tools which require high grip, push, pull or torque exertion on the handle produce high contact pressures, which is known to be one of the primary factors for the development of ATD and also CTD (Eksioglu, 2004; Radwin et al., 1987; Rempel et al., 1992; Riedel, 1995). However some authors have argued that higher contact area can lower the subjective comfort rating, since higher contact area triggers more pressure sensors in the soft tissue (Goonetilleke and Eng, 1994; Xiong et al., 2011). Therefore the designer has to find the optimal contact area which can increase the subjective comfort rating and lower the risk of ATD and CTD which are contact pressure induced. Aldien et al. (2005) provided rough guidelines of pressure discomfort (PDT) and also pressure-pain threshold (PPT), where PPT is higher than PDT and values differ by the area of the hand. Also different subjects reported different values due to subjective perception of the load on the hand. The PDT limit of 188 kPa has been reported by Aldien et al. (2005), however Fransson-Hall and Kilbom (1993) estimated the value as 104 kPa. In order to maintain the desired user performance, the designer has to design tool-handles, which distributes contact pressure more evenly and do not exceed the PDT limits (Aldien et al., 2005). According to finite element simulations performed in by Wu and Dong (2005), it has been shown, that the surface curvature has a big influence on the resulting contact pressure on the fingertip when in contact with an object. Those objects that follow the shape of the hand and the skin's surface result in much lower contact pressures and local deformations of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, which can prevent discomfort and several disorders.A power grasp-produces a very uneven distribution of forces and, therefore, also pressure on the hand and fingers. Fellows and Freivalds (1991) showed that foam rubber grip can be used to provide more uniform distribution of forces and pressures. Due to the deformations of the foam rubber, the test subject applied higher grip forces to the foam rubber grips than those grips of stiff materials. This can be attributed to the fact that the excessive deformation of the foam whilst gripping the handle can produce a “loss of control feeling”. This effect can be attributed to the used thick foam of 4 mm in this study, which most likely allowed excessive deformation whilst gripping the tool handle. The authors also do not provide any material properties of the foam tool handle material. Despite the finger forces were higher, the subjects preferred the foam rubber grips.Finite element (FE) method is computationally intensive and in terms of decision-making a very challenging method that is used to predict the behaviour of observed structure (continuum) considering particular load and boundary conditions (Dolšak and Novak, 2011). It can be used for a wide range of simulations from common structural problems to more specific problems, such as for example the analysis of a tool wear in manufacturing process, simulating additive manufacturing technology, welding, etc. (Deng et al., 2013; Edwin Raja Dhas and Somasundaram, 2013; Tamizharasan and Kumar, 2012). FE method has also been used many times to successfully model, compare and evaluate material choice in the design phase of a product (Novak, 2012). Deformations and stresses that represent basic results of the structural analysis using FE method are also an important aspect in the field of ergonomics. Many authors have shown that composites can be successfully simulated in order to define appropriate material and product design especially in the safety industry (Coelho et al., 2013).Therefore due to the lack of investigation into the choices of materials regarding tool-handles and their potential to increase comfort rating, user performance, and lower the risk of pressure dependent ATD and CTD, we investigated the mechanical contact interaction between a fingertip and composites of rubber and hyper-elastic foam materials using the FE method, and compared them to the traditional materials used in tool-handle design. We modelled the cross-section of a male human fingertip and simulated a contact using various hyper-elastic foams and rubber materials. Based on the findings from FE analysis, material parameters for tool-handle grips are proposed in this paper. Therefore tool-handles with material properties defined based on fingertip grip simulation can lower the contact pressure and thereby also the risk of pressure dependant ATD and CTD. Additionally, the methods allow the designer to set the material parameters to reach the desired rate of the stability while grasping the tool-handle.
