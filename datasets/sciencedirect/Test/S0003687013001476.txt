@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Ski boot quality is determined by mechanical properties and comfort. Comfort is strongly affected by cold feet. The purpose of this study was to determine the microclimate in ski boots. Climate chamber tests with five male subjects and field tests with two male subjects were conducted. Temperature and relative humidity were measured using four sensors placed on the foot and one on the liner. Absorbed water in liners and socks was measured with a precision balance. The subjects gave subjective ratings for comfort. The toe sensor temperature dropped below 20 °C at an ambient temperature of 0 °C, −10 °C, and −20 °C. Relative humidity values at the foot were as high as 78% in the climate chamber and 93% in the field. Water absorption in socks and liners ranged from 4 to 10 g in the climate chamber and 19 to 45.5 g in the field. The results reveal the importance of keeping the feet and in particular the toes warm during skiing. One possible improvement may be to construct the liner so that sweat and melted snow are kept as far away as possible from the foot. Liner material with high water absorption capacity and hydrophobic socks were suggested to prevent wet feet.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Winter sports are popular. Skiing is enjoyed by approximately 200 million people in the world (Hunter, 1999). Important factors to enjoy the sport are performance and comfort of the ski boots, which act as an interface between skier and skis. Several studies focused on the mechanical properties of ski boots with respect to performance (Corazza and Cobelli, 2005; Schaff and Hauser, 1993; Schaff et al., 1997). Besides mechanical properties the quality of ski boots is determined by their comfort characteristics. Comfort of ski boots is related to the correct fit of the boot and to the microclimate in the boot. Temperature is the most critical factor for assessing thermal wear comfort (Senthilkumar and Dasaradan, 2007). Foot temperature is determined by ambient temperature, duration of the exposure to cold, level of physical activity, and moisture in the ski boot (Gavin, 2003; Rissanen and Rintamäki, 2009). Ski boots possess quite good thermal insulation properties. But moisture vapour transmission through the ski boot liner is in general hindered by laminated liner materials. Foot sweating and lack of moisture vapour transmission through the liner lead to moisture saturation inside the ski boot. The presence of condensate facilitates the conductive heat loss. Hence sweat or melted snow in the liner increase the thermal conductance and leads to insulation break downs (Fauland et al., 2011; Heus et al., 2005; Kuklane, 2009; Kuklane et al., 1999). Despite the importance of the temperature management for feeling comfortable there are no published data about the climate in ski boots during skiing. So the purpose of this study was to determine the microclimate in ski boots assessed by temperature, relative humidity, and water absorption.
