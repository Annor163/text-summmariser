Applying different equations to evaluate the level of mismatch between students and school furniture

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Fifteen studies and 21 equations to test 6 furniture dimensions were identified.There are differences in the results when applying the different equations.The interrelations between some equations are based on contradictory criteria.The proposed methodology should allow for a more reliable analysis of school furniture.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The mismatch between students and school furniture is likely to result in a number of negative effects, such as uncomfortable body posture, pain, and ultimately, it may also affect the learning process. This study's main aim is to review the literature describing the criteria equations for defining the mismatch between students and school furniture, to apply these equations to a specific sample and, based on the results, to propose a methodology to evaluate school furniture suitability. The literature review comprises one publications database, which was used to identify the studies carried out in the field of the abovementioned mismatch. The sample used for testing the different equations was composed of 2261 volunteer subjects from 14 schools. Fifteen studies were found to meet the criteria of this review and 21 equations to test 6 furniture dimensions were identified. Regarding seat height, there are considerable differences between the two most frequently used equations. Although seat to desk clearance was evaluated by knee height, this condition seems to be based on the false assumption that students are sitting on a chair with a proper seat height. Finally, the proposed methodology for suitability evaluation of school furniture should allow for a more reliable analysis of school furniture.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
School furniture is not the only cause of pain and discomfort reported by school children. However, being seated for a long period of time in school furniture is being associated with reports of musculoskeletal discomfort and pain (Fallon and Jameson, 1996). Also, school furniture dimensions, within the context in which it is used, may have an impact on some physical aspects of the students. For example, the high level of mismatch between students and school furniture is being associated with adolescent low back pain (Milanese and Grimmer, 2004). A relationship between furniture mismatch and postural overload is also reported by Batistão (2010), because when the seat height is low, students increase upper back left inclination and right upper arm elevation, and when the seat is short, students decrease the upper back flexion velocity and increase right upper arm elevation.Furthermore, Sents and Marks (1989) show, in a laboratory setting, that all children earned higher scores on the intelligence test when seated in furniture that suited their body sizes compared to bigger sized school furniture. This finding was corroborated by Wingrat and Exner (2005), when students were seated in 2 different sizes: traditional classroom furniture and appropriately sized desks and chairs. Smith-Zuzovsky and Exner (2004) reveals that students from 6 to 7 years old, who were seated in furniture that fit them well, performed significantly better on the manipulation test than those who were seated in furniture that was too big for them.The above situation reveals the great importance of defining school furniture dimensions in an appropriate way. Despite that, there is a large number of studies worldwide that show a clear mismatch between anthropometrics characteristics and the dimensions of school furniture (e.g., Afzan et al., 2012; Castellucci et al., 2010; Chung and Wong, 2007; Dianat et al., 2013; Gouvali and Boudolos, 2006; Molenbroek et al., 2003; Panagiotopoulou et al., 2004; Parcells et al., 1999; Saarni et al., 2007). However, Gouvali and Boudolos (2006) state that the equations used to examine the match or mismatch between school furniture and anthropometric dimensions can be problematic in the sense that they are sometimes based on contradictory criteria, originating from theory that has not necessarily been confirmed with research.The main aim of this paper is to review literature that describes the criteria equation for defining the mismatch between students and school furniture, to apply the different mismatch equations to a specific sample, and to propose a methodology to evaluate school furniture suitability.
