Influence of pressure-relief insoles developed for loaded gait (backpackers and obese people) on plantar pressure distribution and ground reaction forces

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Backpackers and obese subjects were benefited by using pressure relief insoles.One of the insoles better distributed the plantar pressures during the loaded gait.The vertical ground reaction force was decreased when one of the insoles was used.Different materials in the insoles influenced the plantar pressures and forces.Gait biomechanics is different among normal-weight, backpackers and obese subjects.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The aims of this study were to test the effects of two pressure relief insoles developed for backpackers and obese people on the ground reaction forces (GRF) and plantar pressure peaks during gait; and to compare the GRF and plantar pressures among normal-weight, backpackers, and obese participants. Based on GRF, plantar pressures, and finite element analysis two insoles were manufactured: flat cork-based insole with (i) corkgel in the rearfoot and forefoot (SLS1) and with (ii) poron foam in the great toe and lateral forefoot (SLS2). Gait data were recorded from 21 normal-weight/backpackers and 10 obese participants. The SLS1 did not influence the GRF, but it relieved the pressure peaks for both backpackers and obese participants. In SLS2 the load acceptance GRF peak was lower; however, it did not reduce the plantar pressure peaks. The GRF and plantar pressure gait pattern were different among the normal-weight, backpackers and obese participants.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The musculoskeletal system is often either permanently loaded, as in obese people, or occasionally loaded as in walkers that wear weighted backpacks (backpackers). In both cases (labeled as loaded populations), alterations in the biomechanical parameters of gait, such as in plantar pressure distribution (Castro et al., 2013; Castro et al., 2014; Hills et al., 2001) and ground reaction forces (GRF) (Birrell and Haslam, 2010; Birrell et al., 2007; Browning and Kram, 2007; Castro et al., 2013; Castro et al., 2014; Messier et al., 1996; Simpson et al., 2012) has been shown. Possibly, these biomechanical alterations may contribute to the higher incidence of low back pain (Grimmer and Williams, 2000; Skaggs et al., 2006), higher perceived exertion and shoulder discomfort (Simpson et al., 2011), second metatarsal stress fractures (Arndt et al., 2002), muscle strain (Birrell and Haslam, 2009), joint problems (Birrell and Haslam, 2009), and foot blisters (Knapik et al., 1992) found in backpackers; and the loss of mobility (Messier et al., 1996), higher risk of hip and knee osteoarthritis (Felson, 1990; Hochberg et al., 1995; Ko et al., 2010), foot ulceration (Vela et al., 1998), and heel pain (Prichasuk and Subhadrabandhu, 1994) described in obese people.Foot orthoses is a general term to describe a broad range of devices including heel lifts, lateral/medial wedges, or insoles (custom-made or prefabricated) (Chevalier and Chockalingam, 2012). These devices have been shown to be effective for managing many foot problems (Bonanno et al., 2011; Colagiuri et al., 1995; Cronkwright et al., 2011; Lynch et al., 1998; Sasaki and Yasuda, 1987). They can reduce and redistribute plantar foot pressure and subsequently avoid or decrease foot pain (Burns et al., 2007). However, the exact mechanisms by which foot orthoses work are yet to be fully understood (Chevalier and Chockalingam, 2012), and the biomechanical effect of these devices is far from the simplistic model often proposed in a clinical context (Nester et al., 2003); also, there is a need to establish the most suitable shoe/foot orthoses across clinical or high-risk populations (Rao et al., 2012).The comprehension of how the forces are distributed on the foot along the stance phase seems to be essential to detecting overloaded regions. The evaluation of the plantar pressures allows assessing the function of the ankle or foot while walking and other functional activities, as the foot and ankle are responsible for providing support and flexibility while weight transferring (Cavanagh and Ulbrecht, 1994). On the other hand, the plantar pressure systems do not provide any information regarding the shear forces. The analysis of the GRF provides global information about the vertical and shear stress forces during gait, whereas the plantar pressure analysis identifies the distribution of the vertical GRF over the plantar foot surface. The combination of both analyses offer more detailed information about specific features of forces acting on the foot during gait (Castro et al., 2013).The knowledge of the different adaptations of the body when submitted to occasional or permanent load, and the development and testing of insoles developed specifically for these potential harmful situations may be helpful to further understand the mechanisms of foot orthoses to make physical exercise safe and to prevent injury. The primary aim of this study was to test the effects of two pressure relief insoles developed for loaded populations on GRF parameters and plantar pressure peaks during backpackers and obese' adults gait. The secondary aim was to compare the GRF and plantar pressures among normal-weight, backpackers and obese participants.
