Given enough time and use, all designs will fail. There are no fail-free designs. This is especially true when it comes to automotive seating comfort where the characteristics and preferences of individual customers are many and varied. To address this problem, individuals charged with automotive seating comfort development have, traditionally, relied on iterative and, as a result, expensive build-test cycles. Cost pressures being placed on today's vehicle manufacturers have necessitated the search for more efficient alternatives. This contribution aims to fill this need by proposing the application of an analytical technique common to engineering circles (but new to seating comfort development), namely Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA). An example is offered to describe how development teams can use this systematic and disciplined approach to highlight potential seating comfort failure modes, reduce their risk, and bring capable designs to life.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) is an analytical methodology used in product development circles to ensure that potential problems have been considered and addressed. It was developed by reliability engineers in the 1950s to study problems stemming from malfunctions of military systems (Rausand and Hoylan, 2004). When DFMEA is used properly, it provides many benefits. These include: [1] improved product/process quality, reliability and safety, [2] reduced development time, [3] fewer late changes, [4] increased customer satisfaction, [5] shorter time to market, [6] early identification and elimination of potential product failure modes, [7] improved validation process, [8] reduced warranty, [9] documented evidence of due care, and [10] improved company image and competitiveness (“FMEA Benefits”, 2013).A DFMEA is, in principle, a form of inductive reasoning. The intent is to supply strong evidence for (not absolute proof of) the truth of the conclusion. It stems from experience with similar products and/or usage conditions (i.e. examples that may include both successful and unsuccessful executions). Contrast this with deductive reasoning where a logically certain conclusion is reached from general statements. Ergonomists trained in the scientific method would recognize deduction as the approach through which hypotheses and theories are tested. This is not to argue that inductive reasoning has no place in the scientific method. The point, instead, is that hypotheses and theories are, often times, formulated using inductive reasoning.Automotive seat systems are products that are developed to deliver four primary functions. Listed in no particular order, they are [1] be aesthetically pleasing, [2] be safe, [3] be supportive, and [4] be comfortable. Most seat design and engineering efforts are concentrated on these functions.Product development geared toward delivering a good automotive driver seat is always a balance between these competing functions/demands. As one example, the safest head restraints are not necessarily the most comfortable. Franz et al. (2012) have realized this and are actively working to improve head restraint comfort. Eriksson (2005) describes how the incidence of whiplash associated disorders in rear-impact crashes can be decreased by positioning the head restraint closer to the head, in line with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 202a (NHTSA, 2004). Unfortunately, having introduced several new vehicles that comply with FMVSS 202a, vehicle manufacturers are reporting an increased number of complaints from consumers regarding head restraint closeness (Kolich, 2010). As another example, highlighted by Kamp (2012), aesthetics compete with comfort in that highly contoured (i.e. stylish) seats may not always be the most accommodating (e.g. sport car seats do not always fit everyone).Further complicating matters is the lack of consensus concerning an operational definition of automotive seating comfort. The task of creating a universally accepted operational definition is complex. Consider, for example, the fact that there is little agreement as to whether comfort and discomfort should be regarded as being a bipolar continuum or as composing two experiential dimensions. Branton (1969) assumed that an automobile seat is unlikely to impart a positive feeling to the sitter. That is, the best a seat can do is to cause no discomfort. From the same perspective, Hertzberg (1972) defined comfort as ‘the absence of discomfort’. Many of today's researchers have adopted this definition because, in the current environment, it is more straightforward to quantify discomfort than to measure comfort. Other researchers argue that seat comfort is a bipolar dimension that can be attributed to characteristics of design (Richards, 1980). Evidence to support this claim comes from the fact that occupants, when given the opportunity, rate their subjective responses across an entire continuum, ranging from positive comfort to discomfort. This is the school of thought subscribed to by researchers involved in designing comfort enhancing products (e.g. massaging seats).Zhang et al. (1996) believe that discomfort and comfort are based on independent factors. Feelings of discomfort are associated with pain, tiredness, soreness, and numbness. Comfort, on the other hand, was based on feelings of well-being and the aesthetic impression of the seat. A reduction of discomfort does not necessarily bring about feelings of comfort. There is no connection between the two entities.Shen and Vertiz (1997) have proposed that comfort and discomfort coexist as separate dimensions, with the possibilities for comfort increasing when discomfort decreases. They describe comfort as the result of a continuous behavioural process of decreasing discomfort. For example, a wider, more supportive seat may provide better comfort than a narrower seat, even though the narrower seat does not produce a different level of discomfort.Specific to automotive seating and in support of his own research activity, Kolich (2008) defines comfort as a consensually held construct [i.e. a large group of representative people (aligned to the target customer/market in terms of demographics, anthropometry, and values) perceive the seat in a similar manner] possessing a static and dynamic component that can be manifested objectively (i.e. is consistently quantifiable). This definition was used to guide the remainder of the present work.Relative to those responsible for seating comfort development (typically, but not exclusively, ergonomists), there appears to be a lack of emphasis on traditional engineering disciplines and the related analysis techniques that are foundations to product development. They have, historically, been substituted by elaborate subjective evaluation methods (executed in the form of clinics), which are applied at specific points in the development process. It is common, in seating comfort development, to conduct clinics that coincide with program milestones. An example of these milestones is provided in Fig. 1.The most effective/meaningful form of clinic involves a dynamic component (i.e. driving) and is referred to as a ride & drive. The most common embodiment involves highly structured questionnaires that direct occupants to assign feelings of discomfort to specific regions of the seat. The questionnaires, which typically contain numeric scales (e.g. 1 = very uncomfortable to 10 = very comfortable), yield subjective ratings that are translated, at the competitive benchmarking milestone (Phase I of Fig. 1), from a target seat to a program-specific performance requirement/specification. At all subsequent milestones (from concept demonstration to validation – i.e. Phases II to VI of Fig. 1), seats are built and evaluated using the same subjective evaluation approach. More specifically, the target seat is evaluated against the next generation seat until the new program seat meets or exceeds the comfort level offered by the target seat. The purported strength of this process lies in the A to B comparison of seats. A successful program (one that matches the performance of a target seat), since it takes approximately three years to execute, will be just as comfortable as the best seat in the market three years ago. This is, clearly, a problem.There are other noteworthy limitations associated with the clinic process. For one, there is no research to suggest an appropriate ride & drive duration (i.e. how long does the evaluator need to sit in the seat to provide a meaningful assessment?). This is an important consideration because it impacts the number of prototypes needed and the number of evaluators (per day) that can reasonably be expected to participate; all of which affect cost, time, and data sufficiency from a statistical power perspective (i.e. confidence in the design recommendations). The interested reader is referred to Kolich (2008) for a more detailed discussion of the limitations.The limitations produce an overly iterative development process. Prototypes are designed, built, evaluated with target customers, re-designed, re-built, re-evaluated with target customers, etc. in what can, for some ergonomists, seem like a never-ending loop. Even if the process could consistently deliver a comfortable seat (unfortunately, this is not the case), the tumultuous state of the global economy and the associated strain being placed on vehicle manufacturers has made this type of iteration untenable. Since good seats (i.e. seats that the customers and, therefore, vehicle manufacturers are satisfied with) are an exception and not the rule, it must be concluded that the current seating comfort development process is, at least, somewhat ubiquitous and in need of overhaul.To improve the process, the industry has, moved toward augmenting the subjective clinics with various types of objective indicators. Inherent in this are two assumptions. The first is that the objective indicators have been correlated to subjective impressions. The second is that the objective indicators are more reliable and easy to apply.Seat contour, for example, is amendable to characterization that is more “objective” in nature. Fig. 2shows how the complex shapes associated with seating surfaces can be reduced to specific sections. It is possible to dimension each section and establish target values. What Fig. 2 does not demonstrate is the important relationship between the seat surface and H-Point (SAE J826, 1995). The H-Point represents the manikin's most important reference point; a joint intended to represent the pivot between the thighs and torso of a vehicle occupant. With the manikin installed in a vehicle seat, the location of the H-Point and the torso and thigh angles are key measures of the vehicle interior geometry. These measures are related to support, which, as described, is one of the four primary functions of a seat, and are audited during assembly operations. Many industry design practices, standards, and regulations (including those related to safety) reference the H-Point (e.g. SAE J287, 2007; SAE J1100, 2002; SAE J1517, 1998).Initial softness, overall seat hardness, and hardness distribution can also be quantified. The methods are similar in that they all yield load vs. deflection curves of trimmed cushions, seatbacks, and head restraints. The principal purposes are, however, distinct. Each test uses a different sized indenter and load. The initial softness test is intended to replicate a customer touching the seat before sitting and as such the load is comparatively light and the indenter is small. The underlying notion is that hand feel is important to impressions of comfort. The overall hardness test is supposed to provide insight into the seated occupant's perception of softness (highest load and largest indenter), whereas the hardness distribution test provides a means of determining the uniformity/consistency of feel. More detail concerning these methods can be obtained from Montmayeur et al. (2007) and the Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan (JASO B407-87, 1987). Fig. 3displays a typical load deflection machine equipped with a rigid butt form (which is a type of indenter). Sample overall cushion hardness output is shown in Fig. 4. Target curves can be established, correlated to subjective ratings, and used to develop the program seat.Three other objective indicators that have been used in seat comfort evaluations are pressure distribution (Kolich, 2004), electromyography (Ellgast et al., 2012), and occupied vibration transmissibility (Gu, 1998). Mergl et al. (2005) have correlated the contact forces between people and automotive seats (pressure distribution) to subjective impressions of comfort. Zenk et al. (2012) investigated the concept of “optimal load distribution” based on the relationship between the pressure on the seat and the discomfort felt by the seated occupant. Hartung et al. (2004a, b) have done extensive investigations into human sensitivity to pressure in seated postures and the associated reliability of these types of measurements.Electromyography (EMG), as applied to seating, is taken as a measure of muscular load (usually of the back muscles). It has also been used to assess body posture and movement, in particular spinal postures. EMG has been used, among many other applications, to compare and contrast the effects of different lumbar mechanisms integrated into automotive seats (Kolich et al., 2001).Transmissibility is especially interesting in that it has, for many years, been used as an indicator of ride quality. Transmissibility is the non-dimensional ratio of the response amplitude of a seat system in steady state forced vibration to the excitation amplitude expressed as a function of the vibration frequency (Griffin, 1990). The ratio may be one of forces, displacements, velocities, or accelerations. The most direct method of measuring the transmissibility is to compare the acceleration on the seat surface with that at the base of the seat. To accomplish this, standard practice is to acquire signals provided by accelerometers mounted at the base of a seat (e.g. floor attachment points) and at the interface between the seat surface and the human body. The transmissibility of a seat can be measured on any axis (e.g. vertical, lateral, or horizontal) or at any point (e.g. beneath the ischial tuberosities or between the human back and the seatback). Most of the available research involves only the vertical transmissibility from the seat base to the ischial tuberosities, as this is thought to be the primary axis affecting ride quality (Kolich et al., 2004; Lee and Ferraiuolo, 1993; Fairley and Griffin, 1986).More recently, the focus of the automotive industry, including seat engineering, has shifted toward simulating the aforementioned objective tests and integrating digital human modelling (Paul et al., 2012a; Mergl et al., 2004). As an example, Paul et al. (2012b) showed that the interface between the human occupant and driver seat could be modelled in enough detail to determine the contribution of various seat components to hardness and pressure. Kim and Martin (2012) established an empirical database that could support a biodynamic model taking into consideration human activity to predict reaching performance under whole body vibration exposure. Marca et al. (2011) have recognized that, in order for this type of virtual work to significantly reduce development cost and time, it is necessary to “chain simulations”. That is, to expand beyond comfort-related attributes and into safety, durability, and craftsmanship.With this as the back-drop, the objective of this paper is to demonstrate, via a working example, how and when a staple of engineering, namely Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA), can be applied to the seating comfort development of a full-foam driver's seat (i.e. a driver's seat in which the trim and foam is placed on a “dead pan” and rigidly mounted to the vehicle floor pan; contrasted this with a seat system in which the trim and foam rests on top of a spring system of some type). The belief is that, by incorporating this systematic and widely applied/accepted analytical approach, ergonomists could decrease the excessive iteration that is part of the current development process (thereby reducing cost, time, and measurement error), minimize the likelihood of failure, and further the science of seating comfort.
