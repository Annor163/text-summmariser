@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study investigated the effects of a compressed working week with high cognitive and emotional work demands within the population of Dutch Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) pilots. Work stressors were measured and levels of well-being were examined before, during and after a series of day and night shifts. Results revealed that (i) the start of a series of day shifts was more taxing for well-being than the start of a series of night shifts, (ii) there were no differences in the decrease in well-being during day and night shifts, (iii) distress during shifts was more strongly related to a decrease in well-being during night than during day shifts and (iv) it took HEMS pilots more time to recover from a series of night shifts than from a series of day shifts. It is concluded that HEMS pilots should not start earlier during day shifts, nor have longer series of night shifts.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Shift work is associated with a higher risk of accidents and ill health (Åkerstedt, 1990). These negative effects of shift work especially apply to night work and are mainly attributable to circadian disharmony (Åkerstedt, 1990; Costa, 1996; Smith et al., 2010). Night work disrupts the natural circadian rhythm because it requires people to be active at times when they would normally be sleeping, and vice versa. During night work, adaptation in circadian rhythm is limited (Ferguson et al., 2012). As a consequence, performance decreases (Burgess et al., 2013) and many shift workers suffer from insufficient and suboptimal sleep, resulting in incomplete recovery between shifts (Geurts et al., 2013). As feeling recovered is beneficial for performance during the next work day (Volman et al., 2013) and recovery has been argued to be a vital link between demanding work characteristics and employee health (Geurts and Sonnentag, 2006), incomplete recovery could be an important factor in the association between shift work and a higher risk of accidents and ill health.The adverse effects of shift and night work could be particularly pronounced in the presence of additional demanding shift characteristics such as long work shifts (Rosa, 1995), varying workload that is either too low or too high causing passivity or high strain (Karasek, 1979), and high emotional (Maslach, 1982) and cognitive demands (Paas et al., 2003). These demands may deplete energy resources and thereby intensify the load effects and negative emotions caused by work stressors (Zohar et al., 2003). Such a combination of demanding shift work characteristics can be expected among employees working for ambulatory emergency services. In the current study, we examine a national population of such employees, that is, pilots working for the Dutch Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS). HEMS provides 24/7 on-scene assistance to trauma patients. To provide this assistance, HEMS employees work a compressed work schedule of circa 40 h in three consecutive day or night shifts, with at least three free days between the series of shifts. HEMS pilots do not work a fixed pattern in the sequence of a series of day and night shifts, but generally their series of day and night shifts are alternated. The duration of one shift is long: almost 13 h with a maximum duration of 15.5 h per shift. During their shifts, they are called upon when an emergency happens and this makes their workload highly variable and unpredictable. During a mission, pilots are continuously interpreting information and making decisions that require high cognitive effort (Watson et al., 1996). In addition, HEMS employees are confronted with high emotional demands as they often encounter emotionally taxing situations such as driving accidents, heart attacks and falls (Blau et al., 2012). It is possible for HEMS employees to sleep during night shifts when they are not called upon.The aim of the current study is to examine the effects of a compressed working week with high cognitive and emotional work demands in relation to well-being and recovery within the population of HEMS pilots. Although there are studies examining the economic costs and benefits of HEMS as a facility (for a review see Taylor et al., 2010), studies examining well-being and recovery of HEMS pilots themselves are rare. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine well-being and recovery in this population. Four focal issues are central in this paper: (1) well-being at the start of a series of shifts, (2) well-being during a shift, (3) work characteristics and well-being during a shift, and (4) recovery after a series of shifts.Dutch HEMS personnel start their day shifts at 6:30 AM and their night shifts at 6:30 PM. The early start of day shifts requires an advancing of the body's timing system while the start of a series of night shifts requires a delaying of the body's timing system. Research shows that advancing, instead of delaying the body's timing system, is associated with more health complaints such as head-ache, irritability, gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue and loss of concentration (Waterhouse et al., 1997). Therefore, we expect that the start of a series of day shifts is associated with lower levels of well-being. More precisely, we hypothesize that at the start of a series of day shifts, well-being is lower than in the morning on a preceding day off. The start of a series of night shifts is not associated with lower levels of well-being when compared to levels of well-being on the evening of a preceding day off (Hypothesis 1).Empirical literature on long work hours has shown that long shifts increase fatigue and cause a higher risk of accidents and reduce performance (Rosa, 1995). Previous research has shown that these disadvantages seem to be most pronounced for night shifts (Smith et al., 1998; Rosa, 1995) and toward the end of long shifts (Folkard, 1997). As HEMS personnel work day and night shifts of almost 13 h, we expect a significant decrease in well-being during individual shifts (Hypothesis 2a), and a higher decrease in well-being during night shifts when compared to day shifts (Hypothesis 2b).The decrease in well-being during shifts is not only determined by the length of a shift, but also by the work content and experiences during a shift. HEMS pilots can be expected to face relatively demanding work characteristics such as highly variable and unpredictable workload and emotional stressors. In previous research, such demanding work characteristics have been associated with low levels of well-being (de Jonge et al., 2008; Van der Doef and Maes, 1999). Moreover, the cognitive-energetic model of affective reactions posits that negative emotions following disruptive events are intensified when limited energy resources are available (Zohar et al., 2003). As night shifts cause a significant loss in sleep and deplete energy resources (Rosa, 1995), the negative emotions caused by work stressors could be intensified during the night. Therefore, our third hypothesis states that during night shifts, job stressors (workload as well as distress during shifts) are more strongly associated to a decrease in well-being than during day shifts (Hypothesis 3).Over the last decades, awareness has risen that recovering from stress, during work or leisure, is important to preserve performance (Volman et al., 2013) and health (Geurts and Sonnentag, 2006). The small adaptations in circadian rhythm during night work (Ferguson et al., 2012) could result in a longer time needed to recover from a series of night shifts than from a series of day shifts. This longer recovery time could explain the adverse effects of night work (Åkerstedt, 1990; Costa, 1996; Smith et al., 2010), as slow and incomplete recovery impedes health and well-being (Meijman and Mulder, 1998). Our fourth hypothesis states that HEMS pilots need a longer time to recover from a series of night shifts than from a series of day shifts (Hypothesis 4).
