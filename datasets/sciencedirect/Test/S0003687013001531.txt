@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The present work is dedicated to the study of cold thermal environments in food distribution industrial units through a subjective assessment based on an individual questionnaire which aims to describe the working conditions of employees often exposed to cold. The survey was carried out in Portugal and the sample consists of 1575 valid responses obtained in 61 industrial units. The results show that the food distribution activity sector is characterized by a female population (78.1%) and by a young work force (63.4% of the workers are less than 35 years old). Despite the availability of cold protective clothing (52.8% of the workers indicate one garment) its characteristics require improvements. In addition almost 1/3 of the respondents consider the thermal environment cold and 79.6% of the workers report that working in the cold is harder in wintertime. The results also highlight that 37.3% of the workers report having health problems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The occupational exposure to extreme thermal environments, either hot or cold, represents an issue that should be duly considered due to the very significant number of workers involved. Based on a field survey carried out in Portugal, this work is dedicated to the study of cold thermal environments. The occupational cold exposure, assessed in terms of the Required Clothing Insulation Index (IREQ) (ISO 11079, 2007) developed by Holmér (1984), was first characterized by Oliveira et al. (2008) in an extensive study that has quantified the thermal conditions of six activity sectors mainly in food production, conservation and distribution industrial units. This study, based on the IREQ index, shows that in Portugal the number of people working in cold environments is much more important than was initially predicted.However, it is widely recognized that the activities developed in both moderate and extreme thermal environments should be evaluated from multiple perspectives and subjective assessments are being looked at with growing interest. Cohidon et al. (2009) studied the perceived health status and psychosocial factors of meat industry employees in France through a postal survey that included 3000 workers. Yasuo et al. (2010) performed a cross-sectional study involving 991 workers in 126 kitchen facilities in Japan to evaluate subjective thermal strain in different working environments using a self-reporting questionnaire survey and subjective judgment scales. The interrelationships of subjective assessments (thermal sensation, perceptions and preferences for individual and climate parameters) as well as their connections with the prevailing thermal conditions were analyzed through interviews to 967 visitors of Szeged, Hungary, by Kántor et al. (2012). Arezes et al. (2013) tested thermal comfort of trekking boots through objective and subjective evaluations and Boschman et al (2013) assessed the psychosocial work environment and mental health among construction workers using a questionnaire. The importance of the subjective surveys is also raised by international standards, namely in the case of cold thermal environments (ISO 15743, 2008; ISO 28802, 2012).The increasing awareness of the importance of this tool lead the authors to a new and detailed approach that resulted in an additional study focused in a subjective assessment of the occupational exposure to cold thermal environments. Hence, the present contribution represents a complementary analysis of a previous study (Oliveira et al., 2008) but the aim is now restricted to food distribution industrial units. Despite being focused on Portuguese workers, the present analysis can be of potential interest and regarded as a valid contribution to other countries and industrial activities.The present survey was carried out in large and medium size supermarkets owned by an important economic group, which has been formally invited to participate in this study and has immediately accepted and encouraged the project. This active cooperation included the participation of all the industrial units of the group distributed all over Portugal main land. This full cover of the territory and the participation of 61 industrial units turned into the first large characterization of the working conditions through individual questionnaires.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The present paper addresses the occupational exposure to cold thermal environments in the food distribution activity sector through a subjective analysis. The results consider the conditions observed in Portuguese plants and the outcomes are then more important to the workers concerned. However, the methodology that was applied in the survey is meaningful for any occupational hygienist interested in cold stress studies. In addition, since the conservation temperatures are about the same in all countries, the main conclusions of the present work can be generalized and considered valid in any country.The food distribution sector is characterized by a young population with a short-length professional career. Surprisingly, it was observed that the cold exposure required in this activity sector is generally guaranteed by women. Almost 1/3 of the respondents consider that the thermal environment, despite being usually rather cold, it is even colder in winter. Workers with less years of activity seem to be more satisfied with the thermal ambient than veterans with more than 10 years of activity. In addition, the results highlight that the average feeling of cold and the occurrence of Metabolic and Other Health problems are slightly higher among women. The health problems reported, all listed in ISO standard 12894 (2001), should promote an active medical supervision of individuals continuously exposed to cold environments. Regardless the wide distribution of cold protective clothing, further improvements are still required, a matter that is pointed out by women which consider the protective garments less adequate than men. Finally, this study provides guidelines to improve working conditions and to adopt preventive measures and good practices which are aimed to reduce the health problems related with cold environments.
