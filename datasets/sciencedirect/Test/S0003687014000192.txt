@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Representations of archetypal users (personas) have been advocated as a way to avoid designing in isolation. They allow communication of user needs and orient teams towards user experience. One of the challenges for developers of interactive medical devices is that most devices are used by a wide variety of people, and that developers have limited access to those people; personas have the potential to make developers more aware of who they are designing for. But this raises the question of whether it is possible to deliver useful, valid personas of interactive medical device users. The aim of this research was to develop and test a rigorous, empirically grounded process of constructing personas, with the objective of reflecting on that process. Many challenges were encountered: we found that directly linking the personas to a user population was not possible and although personas were a useful tool for supporting communication and elicitation across disciplines, it was hard to make them representative when picking details that were relevant and checking accuracy. Checking the content resulted in disparate, possibly incommensurable, views. Despite this, the personas proved useful in supporting the transfer of knowledge across professional perspectives.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Establishing a ground truth and providing a global representation of healthcare professionals is difficult. We therefore need to find ways for teams to build and manage their own understanding. Our findings show that the persona technique can be used to support, and complement a number of Knowledge Elicitation (KE) techniques such as documentation analysis, think aloud, unstructured interviews, structured interviews, group interviews, probes and event recalls (Hoffman et al., 1995), as well as standard usability practice (e.g. (IEC, 2007)). The personas are working as a “first pass knowledge base”, (Young and Gammack, 1987), which allows mismatches between the understanding of those involved to be identified and opinions expressed and negotiated. Although there is a well-established, frequently applied literature regarding how to understand context with regard to user and usage (Holtzblatt, 2009), there is less developed literature regarding how different disciplines can communicate, combine and reconcile understanding. Although untested, we would expect the persona technique to offer a broad range of advantages to industry: for example, getting new recruits to consider important aspects of the customer; disseminating information about users across an organisation; making the process of discussing user needs fun; making it easy for employees to represent the user, or switch hats when it comes to discussing user requirements; and giving employees look ahead regarding future customers.None.This work is part of the CHI + MED: Multidisciplinary Computer–Human Interaction research for the design and safe use of interactive medical devices project, supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/G059063/1].
