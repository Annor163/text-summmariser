Extending systems ergonomics thinking to accommodate the socio-technical issues of Systems of Systems

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
SoS differ from systems with subsystems, because of multiple ownership.This requires a different socio-technical approach to sustain them.‘Surprises’ are endemic to the SoS and resilience is a key attribute.It is sensible to treat the SoS as a ‘wicked problem’, and use appropriate methods.Governance is therefore of primary importance as a feedback mechanism.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Socio-technical issues for Systems of Systems (SoS) differ in several ways from those for systems, mainly because the individual systems that are components of the SoS are usually owned by different organisations, each responsible for the optimisation and operation of its own system. Consequently, management of the SoS is about negotiation and management of the interfaces. Because of issues of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), commercial confidence, and the like, there is seldom sufficient, timely information in circulation about the SoS. Surprises are endemic to SoS, and resilience is a fundamental requirement. This paper outlines the different characteristics of SoS compared to ordinary systems, discusses many of the socio-technical issues involved, and then outlines a generic approach to these issues, treating the SoS as a ‘wicked problem’. Endemic to this is the need for governance, which is discussed briefly. This is followed by a description of the evident gaps in knowledge about the functioning of SoS, and a listing of tool classes, the development of which would enable progress to be made more effectively. Finally, the paper discusses how the SoS approach might be the best way to entrain ICT to address global drivers, thus pointing to the importance of the SoS approach.The ergonomics profession is fairly well-equipped to deal with the socio-technical issues of systems, as the papers in this Special Issue attest. However, when one moves up to the next level of complexity, where systems themselves become bound into Systems of Systems (SoS), more issues emerge that require consideration, and which affect both the application of systems ergonomics thinking at the lower level of systems and at the SoS level. This paper discusses these extra issues, and ways in which they may be addressed.By definition, SoS are much larger than the systems of which they are composed, and in many cases will be in existence for much longer than these component systems. They are often fundamental to the fabric of society and the functionality of the nation-state; examples are the government of the state itself; defence, law and order, and the continuous provision of energy, clean water, health & social security, and transport.The aim of this paper is to highlight particular Human and Organisational issues that pertain to the design and operation of an SoS and to outline new approaches, methods and tools that need to be developed to address these issues. We begin by setting the context to provide a framework for the discussion which follows.Section 1 introduces some of the established ways of characterising SoS, and outlines some of the differences compared to Systems Engineering. Section 2 discusses a number of the socio-technical issues arising from these differences; section 3 outlines how complexity within an SoS renders nugatory the standard, reductionist approach to solving systems issues. Section 4 then addresses the problem of delivering resilience in a SoS, making use of the ‘wicked problem’ approach, and section 5 discusses the technical and engineering governance of SoS, without which the ‘wicked problem’ approach is unlikely ever to succeed, and finally section 6 outlines a role for the SoS approach in addressing global drivers, as a way of showing its importance. However, on the basis of what goes up also comes down, the paper ends by considering some of the lingering drawbacks of this approach.There are many definitions of System(s) of Systems, some of which are dependent on the particularity of an application area. Jamshidi (2009) has reviewed more than seven definitions of SoS and, although none are accepted universally by the community, the following has received substantial support and is adopted for the purpose of this paper:“A SoS is an integration of a finite number of constituent systems which are independent and operable, and which are networked together for a period of time to achieve a certain higher goal” (Jamshidi, 2009)Firstly, it should be noted that according to this definition, formation of a SoS is not necessarily a permanent phenomenon, but rather a matter of necessity for integrating and networking systems in an organized way for specific goals such as robustness, cost, efficiency, etc.Secondly, there are overlaps with the concepts of Systems, and of Complex Adaptive Systems. Indeed, the SoS approach, as currently understood and discussed, can be seen as an organizational version of the latter, and therefore as a class of system. However, the characteristic of managerial independence for the constituent systems and the implications that flow from this justify a separate classification for SoS, as discussed later.As an example, consider a hospital, funded by the state, and serving a local community. In essence, this is a patient-processing system where initial triage defines the path each patient will take through the specialities, services and functions that are resident within the hospital, such as an ambulance service, X-ray, neurosurgery, paediatrics, maternity, physiotherapy, ward management, nutrition, patient records, waste management, portering, maintenance and many more.Functionally, each of these services can be considered to be a system; for each there is a group of people supported by technology, intercommunicating and interoperating to reach a given goal, and, from a control perspective, able to do this independently of other systems. In practice, as opposed to just a control perspective, each of these will rely on the infrastructural systems such as water, power and so on in order to perform, and, on the basis of the flow of patients and information among the constituent systems, each will fulfil its goals. Fig. 1illustrates the generic interfaces that such systems will require in order to participate long-term in a SoS.The inter-relationship among these systems is highlighted when the phenomenon of ‘bed-blocking’ occurs, as discussed cogently by (Williams, 2010), where wards become full (for example because of a local epidemic or serious industrial accident). Because in the UK the hospital is legally obliged to accept patients, new ones are allocated to other wards. When these in turn become full, patients may be shifted on again; the problem becomes significant when patient records on occasion are not able to keep up with this, and a patient may become temporarily ‘lost’ in the system of systems that comprises the hospital, with a hunt going on to find the patient and restore the patient's treatment path through the designated services.A widely-adopted characterization (Maier, 1998) is given below:▪The elements of the system are themselves sufficiently complex to be considered systemsOperating together the systems produce functions and fulfil purposes not produced or fulfilled by the elements aloneThe elements possess operational independence. Each element fulfils useful purposes whether or not connected to the assemblage. If disconnected the element can continue to fulfil useful purposesThe elements possess managerial independence. Each element is managed, at least in part, for its own purposes rather than the purposes of the collective.As Maier points out, the implications of these characteristics are:▪The development of stable intermediate forms over time for the SoS. Since the constituent systems have managerial independence, they may evolve in their own ways. For the SoS to remain fully functional it may be necessary to identify intermediate forms that enable this evolutionary process to occur without compromising the whole SoSThere is a need for policy triage for the whole SoS; in other words, to know what can be fixed and what can't. Standards and agreed functional protocols are a means of ensuring a degree of constancy and stability in the SoS.Because of the endemic characteristic of managerial independence of the constituent systems, the main sources of leverage to control the development of the SoS must be at the interfaces of the systems, not within them.The maintenance of collaboration across the SoS is essential if it is to succeed in its aims. Necessarily, collaboration is a human-centric process.Latterly, the five SoS criteria above for SoS Engineering have been extended to include: inter-disciplinarity, heterogeneity of the systems involved, and networks of systems (DeLaurentis and Callaway, 2004). Not all SoS will exhibit all of the characteristics, but it is generally assumed that a SoS is characterised by exhibiting a majority of the Maier criteria, and particularly that of managerial independence. Although the individual systems in a SoS are usually considered to have independent operational viability, it is sometimes the case that the SoS must contain some systems the only purpose of which is to enable the interoperation of the other component systems; i.e. the enabling systems cannot operate outside the SoS.A further categorization of SoS has been proposed, reflecting different degrees of control over the SoS, moderating the effect of the implications above (Dahmann and Baldwin, 2008):▪Directed. Directed SoS are those in which the system-of-systems is created and managed to fulfil specific purposes and the constituent systems are subordinated to the SoS. This class of SoS is best accomplished within a single organisation, which has the authority, resources, common standards and protocols to act as the foundations of the SoS.Acknowledged. Acknowledged SoS have recognized objectives, a designated manager, and resources for the SoS; however, the constituent systems retain their independent ownership, objectives, funding, development and sustainment approaches. Supply chains in the automotive industry are an example of this class.Collaborative. In collaborative SoS the component systems interact more or less voluntarily to fulfil agreed central purposes. This class of SoS is best suited to those SoS where the component systems are ‘owned’ by different organisations, all of whom are in fairly equal positions and there is no dominant organisation. The automotive and aviation industries provide examples of this.Virtual. Virtual SoS lack a central management authority and a centrally agreed purpose for the system-of-systems. Large-scale behaviour emerges—and may be desirable—but this type of SoS must rely on relatively invisible mechanisms to maintain it. The world-wide-web is often cited as an example of this.While this is a useful categorization, it should be noted that most large SoS will have parts of the SoS that fit each of these categories, exacerbating the control problems.Table 1below, taken from a recent report (Barot et al., 2012), outlines some of the differences in design and operation between systems and SoS. Many of these point to the need to consider SoS as examples of a ‘wicked problem’ (Rittel and Webber, 1973).An industrial body, the ‘Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium’11https://www.ncoic.org/about/has identified a number of levels at which interoperation at the interfaces of an SoS will occur (see Fig. 1). These are shown in Fig. 2. In recognition of the aims of the Journal and its readership, the discussion that follows is limited to just the five upper levels of this diagram. This is merely a convenience, it is a mistake to assume that there is no interaction between the technical and people levels.There is a particular difficulty in defining the boundaries of a System of Systems when a socio-technical perspective is adopted, arising from the fact that people are now included. It is the capacity of people to operate as thinking, decision-making, responsibility-accepting, goal-seeking entities that makes them of fundamental importance to organisations, and their needs for a support network (sustenance, relaxation, accommodation, training, recompense, etc.) which significantly widens the boundaries to include many more systems. In relation to boundaries, time is of significance. For SoS of short duration (e.g. a year or less), many support systems can be assumed to be stationary, because nothing much will change within that period. For longer-lasting systems, perhaps with an expected duration of 50 years or more (in effect, ‘immortal’), issues of sustainability and change immediately emerge (the social system of systems for policing society, for example). It is also observable that most of the long-life SoS are essential to the continuity, safety, security and well-being of citizens in all the nations of the world, and that many of these SoS are global in extent.Technically, there will be upgrades to the SoS at various intervals, occasioned by new technical developments, competitive pressures, and changes in goals for the SoS and its constituent systems. Socially, for the people in these SoS, there is the inevitable churn over time; as pointed out earlier, within 10 years of operation of a SoS it is likely that some 30% of its human operators and managers are likely to have been replaced, and all of them will have been replaced within 50 years.Furthermore, because humans have cognitive skills far exceeding the capabilities of technical systems in their scope and subtlety, including the ability to know what they don't know, the boundaries of a SoS may have to be widened to include sources of information, knowledge and understanding such as professional societies and web-based networks. It may be necessary to include more amorphous ‘communities of practice’ (Wenger et al., 2004) and ‘megacommunities’ (Napolitano, 2010), in which SoS organisations may pass information to external organisations in other SoS for their benefit, without necessarily having a formal agreement to do so. In passing, this is a different arrangement to a Japanese keiretsu because there are no cross-holdings of shares to bind the participating companies together into a conglomerate and to entrain stability and influence among them.Naturally, the definition of SoS boundaries becomes even more difficult when one appreciates that, for example, other members of the community of practice are probably protagonists in other SoS; where then are the boundaries? It is clear that some degree of pragmatism is required, using some stopping rule such as ‘the system and its owner is within the socio-technical boundary if it is accessed more than 10 times per week, else it is outside the SoS’.An example of these issues was mentioned earlier; consider the policing SoS. The police force itself is composed of many systems to address the ills of society; recruitment, training, specialist units; development of procedures and processes, procurement, operations, maintenance and disposal of assets, links to the prison, justice and probation services, together with less-formal links to victims, criminals, witnesses, lawyers, informants, and the like. And all of these will require sustainment into the distant future.Hubbard et al. (2010) refer to an emerging approach known as Organisational Systems Engineering (OSE) which involves treating the organisation as a system, made up of human, process and technical sub-systems, which interact and interface with each other. Within a SoS context there will be many organisational systems involved in operating and controlling the SoS and hence OSE {from now on relabelled as Organisational Systems of Systems Engineering or OSoSE) will need to incorporate additional purposes as noted below:•Maintain the purposes of the SoS, including the strategies and policies that enable the purposes to be reachedEnsure that the SoS configuration is fit for purposeEnsure interoperability of the systems that comprise the SoSEnsure that the SoS, and the systems within it, are resilient and agile with respect to both foreseeable and unforeseeable risks, the latter requiring considerable human involvement should they eventuate (Provan and Milward, 1995; Barabasi, 2002; deMeyer et al., 2002)Accommodate the restrictions on information flows around the SoS caused by Intellectual Property Rights, commercial confidentiality, security requirements, and many other sources.Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements (the ‘stay out of jail’ requirement)Assure distributed situation awareness to minimise the likelihood and consequences of emergent SoS behaviourEnable evolution of the SoS to occur with minimum disruptionWe give two examples of the need for OS0SE; the first is a military example, in which the USAF B52 bomber, which entered service in 1955 as a high-altitude, nuclear-capable strategic bomber. It is still in service nearly 60 years later, but is now adapted for a role as a high-altitude, close air support capability for ground troops, with an appropriately-reconfigured support network (Willis, 2005a), both to keep it in the air and to enable it to carry out its missions accurately and precisely. This example demonstrates the evolutionary issue for SoS; furthermore, it is noteworthy that given the near 60 years' service lifetime of this aircraft type, there will be nobody actively involved in the support of its current capability who was there at the beginning – the longevity issue.The second example is from the automotive industry (Sheffi, 2005). In the 1990s, Toyota supplier Aisin Seiki made P-valves for brake systems. These anti-skid valves regulate pressure across the brake system, and this company supplied 99% of all Toyota models. Factory No.1, manufacturing these valves, caught fire; 506 machine tools were destroyed. Toyota's alternate supplier was Nishin Kogyo, making 1%, and unable to ramp up production fast enough. Toyota at this time was running at 115% of normal production, as a commercial response to impending legislation.Because of just-in-time processes, Toyota had only a few hours' stock of valves, with trucks on the road carrying another 2 day's capacity. Aisin salvaged some tools, replaced others and was in production in 2 weeks, making 10% of requirements and 60% after 6 weeks, and 100% after 2 months. Both Aisin and Toyota, in their respective keiretsus, asked for help. 22 organisations from the Aisin keiretsu and 36 from the Toyota keiretsu replied. Within 5 days, Aisin had made available blueprints and process expertise and production had been allocated. Notably, Denso, a major Toyota supplier, outsourced their own production to free up tools and processes to produce these P-valves (as did others), and helped to develop alternative processes for the valves using different precision tools in other smaller suppliers. Within 2 days some valves were delivered by these alternate suppliers; within 9 days of the fire, all Toyota plants were functioning as normal again.During this period, neither financial nor legal negotiation took place, nor was pressure applied to Aisin Seiki to prioritise Toyota over other customers such as Hino trucks. However, Aisin eventually covered the direct costs – labour, equipment, materials involved for these suppliers, and Toyota gave their Tier 1 suppliers 1% of their respective sales to Toyota for the January–March quarter as an appreciation gesture. These firms passed on the benefit pro rata to their suppliers, and so on.The examples have been chosen to highlight some of the important human and organisational issues concerning SoS; the need for adaptability, resilience and evolutionary planning. These examples are not unique; other similar (and dissimilar) cases are known around the globe, in different industries in different countries. Altogether, there are many more aspects influencing OSoSE that have been discussed in the professional literature; for example, (Keating et al., 2003; Fisher, 2006; Schaeffer, 2006; DOD, 2008; Rebovich, 2008; Sousa-Poza et al., 2008; Jamshidi, 2009). We discuss a selection of the issues below, using the classes of Government & Legal, Strategic, Policy, Operations and Transaction while bearing in mind the common threads across this classification; bounded knowledge, continuous change, longevity, and the need for resilience.At this level, the three main considerations are the legal framework that ensures competition (in a capitalist society), the governance of SoS, and the implications for society in general should any (or several) critical SoS fail. The competition issue arises when in a given industry, various groups of organisations band together to form SoS that are more able to meet market demands, and thus secure a competitive advantage. At a simplistic level, if most of the organisations involved become components of various SoS, the net effect is to reduce the number of competitors in that market. Furthermore, if some of the SoS are larger than others, they may also accrue an advantage merely due to their size.For example, a major clothing retailer in Europe was in a position where most of its national suppliers sent to it about 30% of their production, making that retailer the major customer whose contract was critical to the survival of the supplier. This meant that the retailer was in a very powerful position to control the supply chain. Over a number of years, because of its size and buying power, the retailer moved into the purchase of raw materials for its supply chain, with the acquiescence of its suppliers. This evolutionary move meant that the retailer had control of input to its suppliers, and control over the suppliers' output, and in principle resulted in a coercive SoS. Fortunately, the retailer was very ethical in its dealings, so the practical outcome was that the suppliers were buffered from the vagaries of the supply-side market very well, and goods for this retailer were produced at lower cost compared to the same goods for other retailers.In a competitive, capitalist economy, this amounts to a loss of competition, which may lessen the benefits that society is expected to gain from such an economy. While this argument is indeed simplistic and somewhat purist, it does point to a role for governmental oversight and for a legal basis for intervention. Both of these require suitable metrics and trigger points for governmental action, and these are probably best addressed by the establishment of a SoS as a legal entity responsible for its actions and the provision of a governance framework for any such SoS. This becomes especially important when a SoS is of critical importance for the security of society in general.This level is concerned with the strategy of the SoS itself. Its strategy will depend on its environment, the volatility of that environment, its geographic spread across different legislations in different national states, and the nature of its business domain and its perceived risks (deMeyer et al., 2002; Hammer, 2002; Tranfield et al., 2004; Sheffi, 2005; Fisher, 2006; Woods and Hollnagel, 2006; Sinclair, 2007; Siemieniuch and Sinclair, 2008; Taleb, 2008). There are two important aspects to this; firstly the operational processes that deliver capability or services that meet the purpose of the SoS, and secondly the maintenance of the SoS itself as it transforms itself over its lifetime to meet extant exigencies, both expected and unexpected.For SoS that may be classed as Directed or Acknowledged, it may be possible to set up Steering Committees and Management Committees (or equivalents) to manage the strategic and policy issues that will arise – NATO military expeditions are an example; in the civilian world, in the UK there is the mandatory ATOL scheme designed to provide a ‘get you home’ service for air travellers booking through holiday companies, requiring those companies firstly to be registered and assessed, and to contribute to an insurance scheme for the air travellers. For co-operative and virtual SoS, such as the rapidly-growing ‘Internet of Things’ –IoT (Marsden, 2012; Swaminathan, 2012), it is largely left to the constituent systems to manage these, through their interfaces. For all of these, and particularly the Co-operative and Virtual SoS, they will flourish best on a ‘level playing field’ delineated and supervised by governments.This general level is more concerned with how the SoS regulates and constrains what and how it executes its business. It is at this level where considerations such as inter-organisational trust, partnering, service level agreements, and contracts are important. Various fundamental issues such as the potential clash between lean operations and the need for resilience must be addressed, and plans for risk mitigations are prepared. As an example, in the automotive industry lean operations imply the smooth, continuous running of assembly lines with minimal holdings of stocks. In turn, this means an operating environment of constant state and ‘no surprises’. To achieve this for the production process requires much managerial and organisational effort around the edges of the process. This can be achieved by extending the stable environment as far as is possible up the supply chain, so that the managerial effort is moved elsewhere. The result, as shown in the Aisin Seiki example mentioned earlier, becomes more brittle; less able to withstand interruptions to supply and any other emergent happenings that impinge on the whole supply chain. Of particular importance in these is the issue of SoS complexity, considered in more detail in section 3, because of the likely occurrence of unwanted emergent behaviour characteristic of systemic complexity.Inter-organisational trust is vital. Because of the bounded-knowledge problem, most SoS operate with incomplete knowledge most of the time. This implies that organisations in the SoS must behave with integrity and fairness, in order that other organisations may predict with some accuracy the likely behaviour, and operate accordingly. Some reassurance will be generated by the terms of contracts, service-level agreements and other formal arrangements; however, unexpected disruptions and other emergent behaviour is always likely (consider the Aisin-Toyota example above), and it is trust in the promises and performance of others that enables co-operative solutions to be found quickly. The intra-organisational conditions for the building of trustworthy behaviour have been discussed elsewhere (Siemieniuch and Sinclair, 2000; 2002); however, some implications for the organisational interfaces within the SoS are discussed below, since they apply to SoS in government, military and civilian domains.•In many inter-organisational interfaces within the SoS, it is the relationship and authority of the roles on each side of the interface that is important. Authority over resources is also important, to obtain the swift response necessary to deal with the day-to-day disturbances and the occasional ‘black swans’ that are characteristic of SoS operations within noisy environments. An implication of this is that the interfacing roles should not have long chains of approvals above them in order to obtain appropriate reactions to events, and maintain the resilience of the SoS. However, in order for delegation of authority and responsibility to work well, there are a number of other issues to be addressed; situation awareness, communications, knowledge and information dissemination being three of these. In other words, the interfaces should be seen as ‘thick’ interfaces; not just abut the transfer of information and products, but reaching further into the organisations to include their cultures and ways of working.Many of the interactions that happen across such interfaces are small-scale problems that require solutions that are not envisaged in the formal agreements between organisations, or may require some ‘bending’ of the rules on both sides of the interface for efficient, swift resolution of the problem. For such exercises to work well, each organisation must have an appropriate culture; good, distributed knowledge of operations, ‘work-arounds’ and events; and devolved authority and responsibility. It also helps if the personnel involved across the interface know each other well, so that they may trust each other during the rule-bending phase.One organisation may have several interfaces with another organisation within the SoS, each managed independently of the other interfaces (e.g. operations, maintenance, financial, etc). This can create a confused image of each organisation, depending on the quality of the interfaces. This points to the need for a strong organisational culture of co-operation, so that the important characteristics for the SoS are dominant. These are usually honesty, integrity, rapid and effective response, the willingness to share both benefits and pain, and respect – in short, the usual characteristics of partnering. These may differ for different SoS, but, whatever the set, they should be demonstrated across all the interfaces.It is at this level where organisational and Information and Communications technologies (ICT) considerations overlap. The ideal for the SoS is smooth operations within the established strategic and policy constraints of each of the individual organisations and of the SoS in which they are embedded. The quality of each interface between the organisations is critical in achieving this ideal, and we discuss some issues below; firstly for ITC, and then organisational.For ITC, the use of well-established open architectures, standards, codes of practice, agreed terminology, etc., is essential. Nevertheless, there remains the problem that local interpretation of these by the designers of software systems, which in the past has resulted in the concatenation of several different ‘best in class’ systems supposedly designed in accordance with the same interface standards, failing to interoperate as consistently as required. The resilience requirements of SoS indicate that there should be provision within each organisational interface of sufficiently-skilled personnel to devise suitable ‘work-arounds’ to allow the SoS to keep operational until a more complete solution is devised. Since these failures of interoperation are likely to occur when unusual circumstances pertain, there is a need for some careful resource planning for this.For the organisation that is contributing a system to a SoS, there are some structural considerations for resilience and smooth operations within the SoS. A service-oriented organisational architecture is a good option in most cases, since its priorities fit the needs of organisations within a SoS. Whatever structure is adopted by an organisation to suit its circumstances, it is likely that a particular issue will have to be addressed; the potential clash between process integrity and process delivery. There will always be pressures, driven by the changing environment of the organisation; to adjust processes to fit a given SoS needs more economically, or more effectively. However, if the process also services other SoS, or there are duplicate processes for other SoS, any such adjustment can result in a loss of overall process integrity and resilience. There appears to be no generalised solution to this issue; each organisation must find its own best solution.In addition, there is the issue of potential incompatibilities of operations within the SoS. Fig. 3below (Gover, 1993) illustrates this, showing a lifecycle for organisations in the computer-chip manufacturing industry, with changes in the drivers for the organisational architecture and operations as the lifecycle matures. It may be that different organisations within a single SoS are at different stages of lifecycle maturity of the market and hence have different drivers and management styles appropriate to these. Clearly this could present incompatibilities on each side of an inter-organisational interface. Equally clearly, the possible existence of these incompatibilities indicates the importance of the considerations discussed in this paper, necessary to ameliorate these incompatibilities.At this level, Information Technology and Communications (ITC) play a critical part. From an organisational perspective, the goal for transactions is to deliver at the interface(s) the content of the transaction (product, capability, information, etc) on time, in full, and at acceptable quality, according to service level agreements. Organisationally, this requires attention to all of the matters discussed above. From an ITC perspective, this implies attention to architectures, networks, protocols, taxonomies, and security issues.
