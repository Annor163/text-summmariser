VICIOUS CYCLE INCREASE IN MOTORCYCLE POPULARITY BRINGS MORE WRECKS

FLORENCE, Ala.
</DATELINE>

Scott Wallace remembers hearing it all three times.
Wallace, 50, has been riding motorcycles since he was a
teenager.
</P>
<P>
That includes three times he would rather forget: when a vehicle
hit his motorcycle, causing him to take a spill.
</P>
<P>
"In all three wrecks, I remember hearing the people driving the
car saying, 'I honestly did not see him,' " Wallace
said.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has to tell Wallace about the dangers of riding a
motorcycle. Even a small object in the road or slight
nudge from a vehicle can cause a spill.
</P>
<P>
Once that happens, a rider is on his own, with nothing
but his helmet and leather attire shielding him from the
inevitable impact.
</P>
<P>
"My fingers are always laying across the front brakes behind the
handle," Wallace said. "I stay in defense mode when I'm
riding."
</P>
<P>
Numerous motorcycle wrecks were reported in the Shoals in 2004, including
at least six that resulted in deaths.
</P>
<P>
Motorcycle riding seems to be gaining popularity. Wallace isn't surprised. He
said he loves the feeling of being on a bike.
"Once you ride and you get that freedom in your
face, that's the best rush you'll ever get in your
life."
</P>
<P>
But he's also witnessed firsthand the dangerous aspects. Aside from the
three wrecks on the streets, Wallace was in a severe
wreck at a motorcross track when he was 15. That's
when he learned why riders wear helmets
</P>
<P>
"When I landed, another motorcycle went over my head and left
a tread mark across my helmet," he said. Wallace was
seriously injured and said there is no doubt the helmet
saved his life.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Russell, enforcement officer for the North Alabama Highway Safety Office,
said cycling has gained in popularity, which means there are
more riders.
</P>
<P>
He said many drivers are not used to looking out for
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
"Habits are hard to break," he said. "Drivers have to start
being aware that (motorcycles are) there and drive defensively."
</P>
<P>
Statewide trends show an increase in crashes, injuries and fatalities involving
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Fatalities increased from 33 in 1999 to 52 in 2003, according
to information from Russell's office.
</P>
<P>
And while some people tend to think of riding as a
young person's hobby, it also is highly popular among older
age groups.
</P>
<P>
Figures from Russell's office indicate 173 motorcyclists ages 15-24 were involved
in crashes in Alabama in 2003.
</P>
<P>
There were 198 motorcyclists ages 40-49 who were involved in crashes
in Alabama that same year.
</P>
<P>
Tuscumbia Police Chief Larry McAnally encountered numerous near misses when he
was a motorcycle patrolman.
</P>
<P>
"Motorcycles are harder to see, even with the headlights on," McAnally
said. "A door frame easily can hide a motorcycle from
a motorist's view."
</P>
<P>
He said there needs to be a keen awareness from those
in cars and on motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
"Backing out of parking places, you really have to be careful
to look for a person on a bike, just like
you do for a pedestrian," McAnally said. "The width of
a person and motorcycle are about the same. The person
riding the motorcycle needs to be aware that people can't
see them as easily."
</P>
<P>
He said motorcyclists should ride more toward the center line of
a street when there is angle parking. "It gives you
more of an edge."
</P>
<P>
Florence Police Chief Deputy Tony Logan said he has read information
from motorcycle manufacturers that indicates ownership has increased by 30
to 40 percent during the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"Because of that, we're seeing a larger number of bikes in
our community," Logan said.
</P>
<P>
He said motorists often say they have trouble noticing motorcycles. In
fact, manufacturers of particularly loud motorcycles now say that noise
contributes to safety because it helps a motorcycle get noticed.
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the importance of a high-quality helmet and leather clothing
cannot be overstated.
</P>
<P>
"Your head is just a fragile egg in a motorcycle wreck,"
McAnally said. "If you come off the motorcycle, the leather
will protect you from getting torn up badly.
</P>
<P>
"That includes gloves. And riding with flip-flops on is one of
the most dangerous things in the world."
