HELMET LAW ISN'T NEEDED, BUT MOTORCYLE TRAINING IS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- For years, waves of motorcycles roared into Austin in a
noisy attempt to convince lawmakers to overturn Texas' helmet law.
</P>
<P>
These Texas bikers were rewarded in 1997 when Texas' 8-year-old helmet
law was struck down.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers don't like competition when it comes to gaseous auditory dissonance.
</P>
<P>
This year, in a surprising turn of events, many of the
same bikers were back at the state Capitol, blipping their
throttles and yelling from the visitors gallery in the House
chamber.
</P>
<P>
Now the bikers want lawmakers to repeal the lingering provisions of
the 1997 law that allows motorcyclists to ride without a
helmet if they have a $10,000 insurance policy or have
taken a rider safety training course.
</P>
<P>
They should have quit while they were ahead. As my grandfather
used to say, "When you hit oil, stop digging."
</P>
<P>
As a motorcyclist who chooses to wear a helmet, there is
no question in my mind that helmets are an extremely
important piece of safety gear. Nevertheless, I supported the effort
to repeal Texas' helmet law.
</P>
<P>
If an argument can be made that women have the right
to choose what they do with their own bodies, the
same freedom of choice should be extended to adult motorcyclists.
</P>
<P>
A few motorcyclists argue that helmets can be dangerous. They claim
that helmets can limit peripheral vision, reduce hearing or cause
whiplash. If helmets were that dangerous, then motorcycle racers would
race with bandannas tied to their heads.
</P>
<P>
Having spent a considerable amount of money attending high-performance motorcycle schools
at race tracks around the nation, I have never met
any instructor, racer or student who thought properly fitted, industry-approved
helmets were a safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
The question for me and many other motorcycle riders is not
whether helmets improve safety but whether the government should impose
a law that punishes adults who choose to accept the
risk of riding without a helmet.
</P>
<P>
The issue is personal freedom versus punitive government laws designed to
protect people from themselves.
</P>
<P>
When Texas joined most states west of the Mississippi River in
repealing its helmet law, lawmakers threw a bone to the
mandatory-helmet crowd by requiring that motorcyclists older than 21 show
they have a paid-up $10,000 insurance policy or proof that
they completed a state-approved motorcycle training course.
</P>
<P>
The bikers now complain that small-town cops in particular don't know
the law and continue to give them tickets for violating
the helmet law.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Texas bikers want the remaining helmet restrictions lifted.
</P>
<P>
A way to improve safety and still allow adults the freedom
to risk their bodies if they choose would be to
require that riders pass a thorough motorcycle training course before
qualifying to take a comprehensive riding examination to earn a
motorcycle license.
</P>
<P>
The state would conduct the written and riding tests and would
approve the private riding schools.
</P>
<P>
As it is now, it's easy for youngsters and geezers to
walk into motorcycle showrooms and ride off on machines that
can outrun $250,000 sports cars without demonstrating they have the
skills to handle their purchases.
</P>
<P>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has figures that show the
annual number of motorcycle fatalities among 40-plus riders tripled over
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Boomers with disposable income are buying powerful motorcycles as a hobby,
but they don't have the training or skills to handle
their machines.
</P>
<P>
I love motorcycles. I am not picking on motorcyclists. I think
the requirements to get a driver license for automobiles and
trucks should be much tougher as well. Poking around the
block and parallel parking does not make a competent automobile
driver.
</P>
<P>
We don't hand out pilot licenses like bingo cards. Neither should
we do so for motorcycles and cars.
