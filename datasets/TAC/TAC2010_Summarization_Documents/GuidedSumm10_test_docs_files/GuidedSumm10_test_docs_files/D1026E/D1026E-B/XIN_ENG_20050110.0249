<P>
The number of car accidents in Italy 
fell sharply last year, according to figures released by Italian 
police on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of car crashes was down 7 percent and the number of 
fatalities down from 3,696 in 2003 to 3,338, a fall of almost 10 
percent.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had recorded more than three million 
violations of the highway code and docked licenses by more than 
four million points.
</P>
<P>
This was added on to more than 600,000 points deducted in the 
last part of 2003, after the introduction of the new penalty 
system on Oct. 27 of that year.
</P>
<P>
Violations of rules imposing bike helmets were down 55.5 
percent and those connected to the use of safety belts by 30 
percent, but speed-limit infractions were up by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has claimed credit for boosting road safety with
the new rules, which impose reductions of license points for every
infraction.
