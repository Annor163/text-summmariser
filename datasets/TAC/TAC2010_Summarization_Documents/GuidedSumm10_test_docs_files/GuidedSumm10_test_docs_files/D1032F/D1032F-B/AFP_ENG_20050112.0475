<P>
Norwegian authorities on Wednesday 
authorized the oil company Statoil to partially resume production on 
two North Sea oil platforms that were shut down in late November 
because of a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
The green light from the Petroleum Safety Authority will enable 
Statoil to produce up to 100,000 barrels of oil a day in an initial 
phase, compared to 205,000 bpd before the accident.
</P>
<P>
Statoil shut down the Snorre A platform and its satellite 
platform Vigdis, the production of which transits via Snorre, on 
November 28.
</P>
<P>
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas 
had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been 
trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Safety Authority said Statoil had "now confirmed 
that production from the satellites is satisfactory from the view of 
safety."
</P>
<P>
Statoil plans to resume full production at Vigdis and partial 
production at Snorre A by pumping oil through underwater extensions 
while repairs continue on the platform itself.
</P>
<P>
"We will resume production very slowly because the well has been 
inactive for a long time," Statoil spokeswoman Kjersti Mostoel said. 
"This could take a long time" to reach the 100,000 bpd level, she 
said.
</P>
<P>
The level of 205,000 bpd will only be reached once repairs are 
completed. This will require inspections, but they have been 
impaired so far due to a storm in the North Sea.
