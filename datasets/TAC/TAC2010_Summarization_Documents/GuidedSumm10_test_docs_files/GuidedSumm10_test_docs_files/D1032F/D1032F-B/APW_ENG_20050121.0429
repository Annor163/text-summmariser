The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority rejected Statoil ASA's plan to resume
full production from its Snorre A field in the North Sea, nearly two months
after a gas leak shut it down.
</P>
<P>
The agency said Friday that it wants more data from the already approved restart
of about half the production before allowing full flows from Snorre A and the
adjacent Vidgis field, which have a combined capacity of 205,000 barrels of oil
per day.
</P>
<P>
Snorre A was shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak that forced the
evacuation of 180 crew members. Although no one was injured, the safety
authority called the blowout one of the most serious incidents ever in the
Norwegian continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown represented about 6.4 percent of the 3.2 million barrel per day
capacity that makes Norway the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi
Arabia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the authority gave Statoil permission to resume production of about
100,000 barrels per day from parts of the two fields that were not affected by
the gas leak. Statoil said production is increasing very slowly due to the
length of the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Statoil sought permission to resume production from the entire
field, a request that the authority said it had to reject pending the review of
data from the partial startup.
</P>
<P>
"The system's been cold for six weeks, and there might be technical problems
that have to be checked," said authority spokeswoman Inger Anda.
</P>
<P>
"The (first phase) startup plan indicated that we and (Statoil) needed to know
how the system was working," before starting up the main production, Anda told
Dow Jones Newswires
</P>
<P>
"They haven't had time to run through the system yet," she said, adding they
would meet with Statoil on Monday to review the status.
</P>
<P>
Statoil was founded by the government in 1972 to oversee the nation's petroleum
interests, and employs about 17,000 people in 25 countries. The government began
partial privatization of the concern in 2001, but retains control.
