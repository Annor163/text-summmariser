Statoil blames sloppiness in serious North Sea offshore platform natural gas leak.

<P>
Statoil ASA blamed sloppiness for a potentially catastrophic natural gas leak
that shut down its Snorre A offshore oil platform on Nov. 28 and cut the
country's oil production.
</P>
<P>
Though no one was injured, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authorities described
the incident in the North Sea as one of the most serious to ever hit the
country's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The leak at the Snorre A platform forced the evacuation of 180 crew, and shut
down that field and the adjacent Vigdis fields, with a combined daily capacity
of 205,000 barrels of oil. Partial production resumed Friday from parts of the
fields not affected by the leak.
</P>
<P>
During the outage, the shutdown meant a loss of 205,000 barrels of oil a day in
production, or 6.4 percent of the Nordic country's estimated 3.2 million barrels
a day of production.
</P>
<P>
State-controlled Statoil blamed poor planning and a failure to follow procedures
for the leak.
</P>
<P>
"Safe operation is a precondition for all our activities," said Terje Overvik,
executive vice president for Statoil's exploration and production in Norway.
"Our inquiry shows that we've failed to live up to our own targets. We must
learn from this incident."
</P>
<P>
The inquiry report said the underlying causes of the incident were inadequate
planning and risk appreciation, and a failure to observe governing
documentation.
</P>
<P>
The Statoil report said the potentially explosive leak started when a length of
casing, used to line the well, was pulled out, causing suction that drew natural
gas into the well.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of gas then escaped through another well casing that was damaged
by wear, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"This was a very serious incident which, in the worst case, could have caused
major harm to people, the environment and material assets," said
Overvik.
</P>
<P>
The well was filled with cement and sealed off to stop the leak.
</P>
<P>
The safety authority allowed Statoil to resume production from parts of the
fields, and flows were slowly building up to expected levels of about 100,000
barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Statoil was founded by the government in 1972 to oversee Norway's oil interests.
The government started privatization in 2001 with the sale of 17.5 percent of
its shares to investors.
</P>
<P>
The company, based in the western port of Stavanger, employs about 24,000
workers, 50 percent of them outside Norway.
