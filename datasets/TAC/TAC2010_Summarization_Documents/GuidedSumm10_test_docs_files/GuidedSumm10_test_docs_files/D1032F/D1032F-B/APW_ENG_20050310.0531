Safety authority blasts Statoil over Snorre blowout; says whole oil industry must learn

Norwegian safety officials harshly criticized Statoil ASA Thursday for a natural
gas blowout at the oil company's Snorre offshore field in November, and ordered
comprehensive improvements.
</P>
<P>
The national Petroleum Safety Authority said the entire oil industry must learn
from Statoil's failings since the incident narrowly escaped being one of the
worst catastrophes on the Norwegian continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
"With only marginally different circumstances the gas blowout at Snorre could
have resulted in a major accident with the loss of many lives," said authority
director Magne Ognedal.
</P>
<P>
"Our conclusion is that the incident was not due to accidental circumstances,
but a consequence of a general failure in Statoil's planning, procedures and
assessments," Ognedal said, after a final report on the accident was
released.
</P>
<P>
The Statoil spokesman authorized to comment on the report was not immediately
available, his office said.
</P>
<P>
The state-controlled oil company's Snorre A _ a steel tension-leg platform _ was
shut down Nov. 28 after a gas leak that resulted in the evacuation of 180
workers. The field was closed for nearly two months, costing about 6.2 percent
of Norway's 3.2 million barrel-per-day oil capacity.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the world's third largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Even though no one was injured, the safety authority described the blowout as
one of the most serious in Norwegian waters. The final report said an
investigation revealed 28 failures to meet regulations ahead of the accident, as
well as areas that could be improved.
</P>
<P>
The incident could have been prevented if rules on technical, operational and
organizational systems had been followed, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
"The PSA is highly critical of the fact that the comprehensive failure was not
noted, and that the errors were not rectified before ... the gas blowout was a
fact," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agency ordered improvements in four key areas involving a failure to comply
with controlling documentation, deficient assessments of overall risk, a lack of
involvement by the management and violations of requirements for well
safety.
</P>
<P>
Statoil shares fell 2 percent to 111.75 kroner (US$18.02,euro13.50) in trading
on the Oslo Stock Exchange after the report was released and the company
announced new cost overruns on its Kristin natural gas field
development.
</P>
<P>
Statoil, founded by the government in 1972 to oversee Norway's petroleum
interests, employs 24,000 people in 29 countries.
