Dutch to prosecute Islamic radical suspect in filmmaker slaying as
terrorist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dutch prosecutors said Friday that an Islamic radical accused of
killing Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh and slitting his throat will be
tried as a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
The decision to prosecute under a new terrorist law indicated that
the crime is considered an act of terrorism. It was the first time
legal officials characterized Tuesday's slaying as a terrorist act,
rather than a murder.
</P>
<P>
Chief Amsterdam prosecutor Leo de Wit said the suspect, Mohammed B.
will face five counts, including murder and "participating in a
criminal organization with terrorist characteristics."
</P>
<P>
Mohammed B. is to be arraigned later Friday behind closed doors.
