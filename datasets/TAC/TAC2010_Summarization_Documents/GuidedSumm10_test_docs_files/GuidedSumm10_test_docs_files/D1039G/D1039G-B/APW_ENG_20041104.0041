Dutch police arrest eight suspected Islamic radicals in filmmaker's
killing

<P>
Dutch prosecutors said police have arrested eight more suspected
Islamic radicals as part of ongoing investigations into the brutal
killing of outspoken Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made in the 24 hours following Van Gogh's slaying
while he was cycling down an Amsterdam street, prosecution
spokeswoman Dop Kruimel said Wednesday. They are in addition to the
arrest of the alleged killer, a 26-year-old Amsterdam resident of
Moroccan origin.
</P>
<P>
Six of the detainees are of Moroccan ancestry, one is Algerian and
the last has dual Spanish-Moroccan nationality, Kruimel told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Kruimel said the suspects, whose identities were not released, were
detained and released during an October 2003 investigation into a
potential terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
"They were previously known to us," Kruimel said. "As of now only one
suspect is being held for Van Gogh's murder, but the investigation
will determine if others may have been connected."
</P>
<P>
The Dutch have reacted with outrage to the killing of the celebrity
filmmaker who criticized Islam, testing the nation's famed tolerance
and straining already tense relations with the large Muslim immigrant
population.
</P>
<P>
Mainstream Dutch Muslim groups condemned Tuesday's killing, which
some experts are calling the first act of Islamic terrorism in the
Netherlands. A number of mosques were closed Tuesday night for fear
of vandalism and political figures were given additional police
protection.
</P>
<P>
The respected NRC Handelsblad reported that conservative politician
Ayan Hirsi Ali, who wrote the script for Van Gogh's latest
provocative movie criticizing the treatment of women under Islam,
received a death threat in an e-mail Wednesday that read "You're
next."
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry said the suspect in the murder of Theo van Gogh
_ a distant relative of the famous painter Van Gogh _ is a Muslim
radical associated with Islamic fundamentalists on a terrorist watch
list.
</P>
<P>
Authorities didn't release his name, but Dutch media identified him
as Mohammed B.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament called for an emergency debate on why the
culprit _ who police say had a record of violent crime _ hadn't been
stopped.
</P>
<P>
"Is this a murder, or is this a terrorist attack?" said Jozias van
Aartsen, leader of the conservative VVD party. "The facts must come
out very, very quickly."
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh released a fictional film in August about the mistreatment
of Muslim women who were shown naked with texts from the Quran
scrawled on their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Police and eyewitnesses said the attacker shot Van Gogh, stabbed him,
cut his throat with one knife, and pinned a note to his chest with
another.
</P>
<P>
The note is said to have contained texts from the Quran in Arabic,
though police would not confirm this. According to NRC Handelsblad,
the note called for an Islamic Holy war, or Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The killing of brash social commentator Van Gogh after the murder of
populist anti-immigration politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002, drew
outrage and fears that people will no longer dare to speak freely.
</P>
<P>
Immigration minister Rita Verdonk told 20,000 Dutch who flocked to
Amsterdam's central square for a noisy wake Tuesday night "we won't
take this."
</P>
<P>
Verdonk called an emergency meeting with leaders of Muslim groups to
discuss how to avoid confrontations. Prime Minister Jan Peter
Balkenende appealed for calm.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Johan Remkes confirmed that the suspect in Van
Gogh's murder was known to have associated with a group of 150
radicals who are watched day and night by the Dutch secret service
for fear they may commit a terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has arrested more than 40 terrorism suspects since
Sept. 11, 2001, including many accused of providing logistical
support for al-Qaida linked groups. But there has never been a
terrorist attack on Dutch soil.
</P>
<P>
"At moments like this, people's prejudices come out," said Masite
Halici, a young Dutch woman of Turkish ancestry who came to lay a
rose where Van Gogh was killed.
</P>
<P>
"They are angry, fearful, grieving. But this is not about Muslims or
non-Muslims. This is about people being able to say what they think."
