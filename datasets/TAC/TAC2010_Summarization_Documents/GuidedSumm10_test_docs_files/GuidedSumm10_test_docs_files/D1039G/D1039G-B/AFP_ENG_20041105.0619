A Dutch judge ruled Friday that the alleged killer of filmmaker Theo
van Gogh should remain in custody for another 10 days together with
four other North African men accused of belonging to a "terrorist
conspiracy", the ANP news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects, both of Moroccan origin, were released because
the judge ruled the evidence against them was not substantial enough.
One of them was immediately re-arrested by the Dutch immigration
services because he was residing illegally in the country, a court
official told ANP.

<P>
Van Gogh was widely known for his criticism of Islam and recently
caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse with the
perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Amsterdam prosecutor Leo de Wit said he had charged seven
people with ties to Islamic groups in the Netherlands, including the
alleged murderer, with involvement in a terrorist conspiracy over the
killing of Van Gogh and with plotting to kill Dutch liberal
politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
</P>
<P>
The chief suspect in Van Gogh's murder, identified in Dutch media as
Mohammed B., is a 26-year-old with dual Moroccan and Dutch
nationality.
</P>
<P>
Police said he was arrested shortly after he allegedly shot and
stabbed Van Gogh while the filmmaker was cycling in Amsterdam
Tuesday. The suspect has so far refused to speak to investigators.
</P>
<P>
A letter left on the body of Van Gogh threatened Somalian-born Dutch
liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali because it said she had turned
away from Islam, as well as Amsterdam's mayor Job Cohen whom it
accused of pitting Jews against non-Jews.
