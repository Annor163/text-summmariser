	   Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people are missing.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They are scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims of the disaster were old people
and schoolchildren.
	   ``We have assumed that the schools in Arop, the schools in
Sissano and the schools in Warapu will be closed because we don't
have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're dead . . . they're all
dead.''
	   Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu
village and the Arop village had been wiped out and the Malol
village had almost been completely destroyed.
	   At Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead, while Malol
village had 40 dead and Sissano 41.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate was expected to arrive in Aitape later
this afternoon to assess the situation.
	   Earlier, the National Disaster Center said that hundreds of
people were missing and thousands had no food or shelter.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
located about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the northeastern
tip of Australia.
