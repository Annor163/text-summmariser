<HEADLINE> 3 Australian Planes Sent to PNG's Tidal Wave-Hit Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia Sunday sent three Air
Force C130 Hercules aircraft loaded with medical and food supplies
on an urgent mission to help survivors of a devastating tsunami
which struck Papua New Guinea (PNG) Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The tidal wave smashed into the northwestern coastline near the
town of Aitape in West Sepik province, killing at least 600
people, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan told reporters in
Adelaide that Australia's aid agency, AusAid, estimated the final
toll would be well over 1,000, with many thousands injured and as
many as 6,000 left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Two Hercules aircraft left the Richmond airforce base,
north-west of Sydney, in the afternoon, while another plane took
off from Townsville. The planes were due to arrive Sunday night
and fly out to the devastated region Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the aircraft were ferrying 60 medical personnel
with the aim of setting up a mobile hospital in the area. However,
he said that how quickly the medical crew could get to work would
depend on whether the landing strip at Wanimo was long enough for
the C130s to land and the possibility of further earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
"It's very rough terrain and our problem is finding an area we
can land and get in our equipment," he was quoted by the
Australian Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministry spokesman Colonel Keith Jobson said that even
when the planes touched down at the airstrip, the defense
personnel would still have to use helicopters or road transport to
access the stricken villages.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer described the events in PNG
as "horrific", saying Australia would do all it could to help PNG
cope with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be further liaising with the Papua New Guinea government
to provide realistic help in those circumstances," he said.
