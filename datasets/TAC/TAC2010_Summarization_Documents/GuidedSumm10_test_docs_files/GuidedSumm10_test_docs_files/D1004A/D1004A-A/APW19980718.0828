	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
	   ABC radio, a government-owned corporation, quoted Australian
army officials Sunday as saying the death toll could rise to as
high as 2,000 people, but that figure could not be confirmed by the
Papua New Guinean government.
	   Among the dead are scores of schoolchildren.
	   Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on Papua New
Guinea's northwest coast, said the tsunami that hit the coast west
of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had
almost completely destroyed another.
	   ``The latest death toll for the district is 599,'' district
disaster coordinating chairman Dickson Dalle said. ``But the figure
may increase as more bodies are found.''
