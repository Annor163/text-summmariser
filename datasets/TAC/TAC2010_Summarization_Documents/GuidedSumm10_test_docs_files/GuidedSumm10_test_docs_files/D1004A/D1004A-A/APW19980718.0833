	   Disaster authorities said the area, about 600 kilometers (370
miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with
villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials and built on
beaches.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the
population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000
people.
	   Australia said it will provide transport for relief supplies and
a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea. Other air force transport
planes were on standby in Sydney, ready to fly supplies in if
requested by the Papua New Guinean government.
	   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is
a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
	   ``She said she was shocked at the tidal wave, and that her
thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and injured,'' said
a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.
