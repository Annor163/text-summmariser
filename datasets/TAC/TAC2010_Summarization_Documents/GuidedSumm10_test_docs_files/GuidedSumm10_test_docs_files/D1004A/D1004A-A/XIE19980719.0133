CANBERRA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in Papua New
Guinea's (PNG) tsunami disaster has climbed to 599 and is expected
to rise, a PNG disaster control officer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's
north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of
Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost
completely destroyed another, according to an Australian
Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape.
</P>
<P>
A 10-meter tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near
Aitape, 800 km north of PNG's capital city of Port Moresby. The
disaster occurred 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about
7.0 on the Richter scale took place.
</P>
<P>
"The latest death toll for the district is 599," Dickson Dalle,
chairman of district disaster coordinating, was quoted as telling
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people were
missing.
</P>
<P>
"There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued," he said. "They are scattered all over in the
mangroves."
</P>
<P>
Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the
Warapu village and the Arop village had been wiped out, and the
Malol village had almost been completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
At Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead. At Arop 16 were
dead.

<P>
PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate was expected to arrive in Aitape
later Sunday afternoon to assess the situation.
