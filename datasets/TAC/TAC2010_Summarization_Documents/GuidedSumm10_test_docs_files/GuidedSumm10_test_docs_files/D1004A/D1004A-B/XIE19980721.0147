<HEADLINE> 5,000 PNG Tsunami Victims Unaccounted for: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- One of the biggest problems
facing relief efforts to the tsunami-hit area of Papua New Guinea
(PNG) is finding about 5,000 people who are still unaccounted for,
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem at the moment is finding those people who
are still lost or hiding or injured or incapable of moving," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the latest available figures from PNG said 705
people were confirmed dead and about 500 bodies had been found
floating, and about 2,500 people have been found alive while about
5,000 people are still unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Defense Force (ADF) has 94 personnel working in
PNG, 60 of them in medical and paramedical roles with three
Australian air force C-130 Hercules and one Caribou transport
aircraft operating there.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press quoted PNG Prime Minister Bill
Skate as saying Tuesday at least 1,200 people were dead and up to
6,000 others remained unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
In a situation report released here Tuesday afternoon,
Australia's international assistance agency AusAID said the exact
magnitude of the PNG tidal wave disaster remains unclear although
the death toll could reach as high as 3,000.
</P>
<P>
It said devastation from the tidal waves, the isolated nature
of the region and poor communications meant there were varying
estimates of the likely human toll, adding the death toll could
reach up to 3,000 people over the next two or three months as
people die from injuries and disease.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the threat of disease from decaying bodies in
the area was becoming very serious.
</P>
<P>
Four days after a 10-meter-high tidal wave washed away villages
where up to 10,000 people lived, terrified, dazed survivors
continued to hobble out of the jungles and mangrove swamps behind
the coast, many with serious wounds and injuries which have become
infected after days in the tropical heat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile food, water, water tanks, fuel and medical supplies
were flowing into Aitape at an increasing rate to be distributed
to centers set up to care for disaster survivors.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Australia's relief efforts, New Zealand and
France also offered their help to the disaster-hit area in PNG.
