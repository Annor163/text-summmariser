RESEARCHERS SAY HORNBILLS HELP RESEED RAIN FORESTS

   SAN FRANCISCO _ It has a raucous call, massive bill and huge
wingspan and until recently it was thought to be a sedentary
stay-at-home creature. But scientists now say the hornbill may be
the key to saving the vanishing tropical rain forests in western
and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, saving the rain forests may also determine whether
the magnificent fruit-loving bird itself survives.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists at San Francisco State University and the University
of California at Davis have discovered that the toucan-like birds
play an elemental role in reseeding the rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   A three-year study in a remote Cameroon rain forest showed that
the hornbill flies 100 miles or more when foraging for ripening
fruit, in the process dispersing seeds _ through its droppings _
for nearly a quarter of the 59 species of trees in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Until the California study, it was thought the hornbill was
relatively sedentary, confining its activities to small patches of
forest and playing a relatively unimportant role in reseeding.
</P>
<P>
   As other important seed disperers such as elephants and primates
continue to fall prey to hunters and habitat destruction, hornbills
become even more important for rain forest regrowth and survival,
the research team said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameroon study found that nearly all the seeds dispersed by
the wandering hornbills germinate successfully, making them one of
the prime agents of lowland rain-forest regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survival of the rain forest appears to rely to a large
degree on the hornbills' ability to disperse seeds of so many
species,'' said Thomas Smith, an associate professor of biology at
San Francisco State and an author of two scientific papers on the
Cameroon study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have any hope of protecting rain forests, we need to
protect not just the pattern of biodiversity but also the processes
that create it,'' Smith said. ``Our work suggests that by
dispersing seeds, these magnificent birds are vital agents of
biodiversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The biologists said that to save rain forests, it is necessary
to save the hornbill, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birds' surprisingly large range suggests that their own
survival depends on preserving large expanses of rain forest
intact,'' said Smith, who also is an associate professor at the
Center for Population Biology at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in the current issues of the Journal of
Tropical Ecology and Animal Conservation, found that two hornbill
species actively soar across gaps in the forest in search of ripe
fruit. A third species is sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monkeys and elephants aren't as good as moving across gaps in
the forest,'' said Smith, ``so hornbills likely provide a crucial
first step in forest regeneration, particularly in regions that
have been cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was the first to document the hornbills' surprisingly
large range and the extraordinarily high numbers of plants for
which they disperse seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hornbills were thought to live in relatively confined rain
forest habitats,'' said Ken Whitney, a doctoral candidate at Davis
who led the seed-dispersal studies as a San Francisco State
graduate student. ``But this research shows that the movement
pattern of a few hornbill species may be more like that of
elephants and some primates, rather than forest birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney was the senior author of the scientific papers in the
two publications.

   Surmising that the resourceful hornbills may actually be nomads
rather than migrants, Smith and his colleagues are working with
scientists at the Wildlife Conservation Society and NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to track the birds' movements by satellite.
They will attach small radio transmitters on as many as 30 of the
big birds and NASA will track their movements.
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by the New York Zoological Society/Wildlife
Conservation Society, the National Science Foundation, San
Francisco State and ECOFAC Cameroon. Other team members included
San Francisco State graduate students Mark Fogiel, Aaron Lamperti,
Kimberly Holbrook, Donald Stauffer and Britta Hardesty, and biology
professor V. Thomas Parker.
