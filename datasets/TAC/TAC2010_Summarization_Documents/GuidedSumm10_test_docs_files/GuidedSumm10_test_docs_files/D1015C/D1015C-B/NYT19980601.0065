 &HT;    Poverty, isolation sparking wildfires

   CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico _ There are no fire hydrants in this village
on the edge of the rainforest. There are also no telephones and no
electricity. Miles of twisting, unpaved mountain roads separate the
town from the nearest city.
</P>
<P>
   If the 55 families who live here lose control of the annual
fires they light to burn away the stubble of last year's crop, they
have no way to quickly notify anyone. They are largely on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of tiny communities like this are scattered across the
state of Chiapas, places where families grow maize and coffee and
graze cattle on steep hillsides, using ancient slash-and-burn
methods to prepare the soil for planting or to coax grasses out of
the ground. The vast majority of the people have neither tractors
nor plows to till the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children walk along the dirt roads, carrying bundles
of firewood on their backs supported by straps stretched across
their foreheads. In the mountains around them, plumes of white
smoke rise lazily in the midday heat.
</P>
<P>
   Cerapio Hernandez Heleria usually would have burned his plots of
land by now. But the continuing drought, plus the fear of losing
control of the flames and starting an enormous fire like the one
now burning in the nearby El Ocote wilderness preserve, keeps
Hernandez uncomfortably idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost nobody in this area is burning,'' Hernandez, 48, said
as young turkeys pecked at the dirt at his feet. ``We're waiting
for it to rain. There's been too many fires already.''
</P>
<P>
   The blackened fields dotting the mountains on the eastern edge
of the rain forest show that few communities are following
Cuauhtemoc in its self-imposed burning ban. On Sunday, men and boys
could be seen on steep hillside fields, hacking at weeds and brush
with machetes as they prepared to burn.
</P>
<P>
   The government has blamed the farmers and ranchers for starting
the fires, which have scorched thousands of acres of sensitive rain
forest in the Chimalapas region west of here and have contributed
to the choking smoke that fills the valleys of Chiapas and has
blown north to Texas and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But government environmental officials also have said they
realize there is no way to stop agricultural burning, and until
this year, there has been little incentive to try. The rains have
always been dependable before, keeping the jungle wet and fireproof
and stopping any wayward field fires before they spread too far.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the rains haven't come. The countryside, even the
rainforest, dried out, and the winds gusted. When the fields began
burning, the fires jumped the narrow strips of bare earth that
farmers typically clear around their land. And there was no way to
stop the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Garcia Murillo, an official with Mexico's environmental
and wildlife department who is helping to coordinate the
firefighting effort in western Chiapas, said poverty is the true
cause of the fires.
</P>
<P>
   The growing population is stretching the land's capacity, Garcia
said. Farmland in the valleys is becoming less productive with more
intensive use, he said, and more farmers and ranchers are
encroaching on the rain forest, looking for better land.
</P>
<P>
   When agricultural fires jump out of the fields and into the
forest, often the farmers and ranchers don't alert the government,
Garcia said. That's not surprising in Chiapas, where many people
have a deep mistrust of the government and where the Zapatista
rebels staged a revolt in January 1994, decrying what they said was
long-standing mistreatment by the government and the state's large
landholders.
</P>
<P>
   But as it faces the worst fires in its history, the government
has relied heavily on the people in the surrounding communities to
help fight them. Together with soldiers who have been ordered to
remote outposts in the mountains, the villagers form the backbone
of the untrained firefighting force.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said he joined about 45 of his neighbors in Cauhtemoc
when the government asked for help fighting the flames in El Ocote
in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered food and water, nothing else,'' he said. ``After
we finished working, we got on our horses and went out using
machetes and rakes to clear away the dry layer of vegetation on the
jungle floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road in another small village, Elias Martinez said
people have been careful when they burn, but the unusual conditions
have made runaway fires inevitable. He's a little annoyed that the
government says agricultural burning started the fires. How do they
know it wasn't a carelessly tossed cigarette?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to start fires,'' said Martinez, who runs a small
ranch. ``The wind and the dryness _ they are things that can't be
controlled. It's too bad that things are burning, but there's no
other way to prepare the land. Once we get some rain, everything
will return to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   As the mountains glow around them at night from fires that have
yet to be contained, Martinez and others who live off the thin,
rocky soil are more concerned about how they will survive if the
skies don't bring relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't plant yet. The ground is too hard,'' said Alejandro
de la Cruz, who grows maize and coffee in Rancho Carrizal, a small
community of 32 people. ``When it starts to rain, we start to
plant. If it doesn't rain, we don't eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say the fires are a sign of the end of the
world,'' he added. ``I think so, too.''
