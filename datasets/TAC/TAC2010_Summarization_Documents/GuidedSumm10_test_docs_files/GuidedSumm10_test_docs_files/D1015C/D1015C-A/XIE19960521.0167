<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Protecting Gibbons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Experts from across China today
called for urgent action to protect the dwindling number of black
gibbons in southern China's Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150 experts and professors from 25 research
institutes and colleges across the country have launched the
nationwide appeal. They called on government departments to
participate in and mobilize social forces to enhance the
construction and management of a natural protection zone on
Bawangling Mountain, where black gibbons live.
</P>
<P>
Located in the western part of Hainan province, Bawangling
Mountain boasts more than 1,000 varieties of wild animals, with
over 40 kinds belonging to rare animals.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, there were 2,000 black gibbons living in the
forest area of the province's 10 counties. Living space for
gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population,
deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of
tropical rain forests.
</P>
<P>
Now there are only 15 to 20 gibbons remaining in the mountain
area.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical
rain forest. They have the same skeletal structure as humans --
four limbs, facial features, internal organs, and similar blood as
human beings; and they are physiologically, psychologically and
mentally similar to human beings.
</P>
<P>
Gibbons are of high research value, regarded by many as
precious as giant pandas in China, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Many international and foreign organizations have paid close
attention to the protection of gibbons. They sent teams to conduct
on-the-spot studies, established research centers, provide funds
and publish information to generate world wide attention to their
plight.
</P>
<P>
Hainan provincial government department has vowed to set up a
foundation for the protection of gibbons, and to prevent and crack
down on activities which threaten the life of gibbons.
